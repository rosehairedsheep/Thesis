Narrator: Hard-pressed Jedi and their valiant clone troopers have thwarted an insidious Separatist plot to plant bombs loaded with the deadly blue shadow virus in key Republic systems. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker have captured the vile scientist behind the nefarious scheme, Dr. Nuvo Vindi. Now the Jedi prepare to transport Vindi to the Republic capital for trial.

EASTERN SWAMPS
Anakin Skywalker: That was close. If that virus had escaped, everyone on Naboo would be dead now.
Obi-Wan Kenobi: Oh, well. Just another boring day saving the universe.
Anakin: All right. Let’s take this sleemo back to Theed so we can help Padmé and Ahsoka clean up down there.

Commander Cody: Senator, you should see this; It’s one of the virus bombs.
Padmé Amidala: It looks like the chamber that holds the virus is missing.
Cody: That droid must’ve taken it.
Padmé: Sound the alarm.
[The alarm starts chirping]
[Meanwhile in the corridors]
Random Clone: How could droids have gotten a hold of the virus containers?
Random Clone: I don’t know. But I don’t want to be around when they set it off.
[The little droid is behind them with the virus container]
Random Clone: We’ve already taken the virus containers out of these bombs. We’ll just have to check them again.

EASTERN SWAMPS
Nuvo Vindi: The virus is liberated. [laughs] You are doomed young Jedi, along with the rest of the planet.

TRADE FEDERATION LAB
[The little droid puts the virus container back into a bomb]
Random Clone: Hey you!
[The droid activates the bomb]
Random Clone: Get away from there!
[The bomb explodes, freeing the virus into the lab]

EASTERN SWAMPS
Anakin: What was that?

TRADE FEDERATION LAB
Captain Rex: Virus leak. Get to the safe room. Come on!
[They start running, while every door around them is closing and the virus is “chasing” them]
Random Clone: There’s the safe room! No chance!
Rex: Hurry! The doors are closing!
[The doors starts closing]
Ahsoka Tano: Don’t worry.
[Ahsoka holds the door with the Force]
Ahsoka: Get inside captain!
[The clones and Rex get on the other side]
Rex: Hurry!
[Ahsoka jumps in and the door closes behind her]

EASTERN SWAMPS
Anakin: Ahsoka what is going on down there?
Ahsoka (Comlink): The droids released the virus, but we managed to seal the lab.
Anakin: And Padmé?
Ahsoka (C): Haven’t heard from her since the bomb.

TRADE FEDERATION LAB
Padmé: Anakin, can you hear me? Anakin!
Anakin (C): Padmé, I’m here.
Jar Jar Binks: Where’s Ani?
Anakin (C): Are you all right?
Padmé: Yes, for the time being. Jar Jar and I were in a safety chamber when the alarm went off. We’re wearing protective suits.
Anakin (C): The virus is loose, but Ahsoka has sealed off the entire facility.
Padmé: Yes, but any remaining droids will try to break out. I’ll do what I can to stop them. I cannot let that virus escape.
Anakin (C): Be careful.
[They end the call]
Padmé: Put this on.
[She gives Jar Jar his helmet, he puts it on]
Padmé: Come on Jar Jar, we’re going to find Ahsoka. We’ll need her help to find those droids.

EASTERN SWAMPS
[Anakin ignites his lightsaber]
Anakin: Where’s the antidote, Vindi?
Vindi: [laughs] You mistake my role, Jedi. My job was to manufacture a plague, not to cure it.
Anakin: We don’t have time for games.
Obi-Wan: Patience, Anakin. There’s more than one way to skin a womprat.
Anakin: I said, “where” ?!
[Anakin moves his lightsaber closer to Vindi]
Vindi: Yes, kill me now and spare these old bones the blue shadow’s dire embrace, because once the first droid breaks out of that laboratory, all Naboo is doomed!
Obi-Wan: Anakin, the fastest way to save Senator Amidala and Ahsoka is to get Vindi back to the capital and find an actual antidote.
[Anakin puts away his lightsaber, they leave the swamps]

TRADE FEDERATION LAB
Random Clone: No, no, no! Some of the virus got in here. We didn’t close the door fast enough.
Rex: We may be dead men, but we could still stop those droids.
Ahsoka: Don’t worry. My master will find a cure for this virus. We’re not dead yet.
Padmé (C): Is anyone out there? Can anyone hear…
Ahsoka: Senator Amidala, we’re trapped in the safe room at the end of complex “B”.
Padmé (C): We’ll be right there. Are you contaminated?
[Some clones start coughing]
Ahsoka: I’m afraid so.

THEED HANGAR
[Anakin, Obi-Wan and Vindi have arrived]
Captain Typho: Dr. Vindi, you’ll pay for your treachery. Take him away.
Obi-Wan: Now we’ll need to find an antidote.
Typho: I think I found an answer for you.
[They follow him into a room]
Anakin: So you think you found a cure?
Typho: Possibly. A little-known extract made from reeksa root, a weed-like vine found only on Iego, the world of a thousand moons, deep in Separatist-controlled space.
[Typho shows a hologram of the antidote]
Anakin: Let’s go.
Typho: You must move cautiously if you-
Anakin: There’s no time for caution! My Padawan is trapped down there, and so is Padmé!
[Obi-Wan gives him an awkward stare]
Anakin: I mean, Senator Amidala.
Typho: I applaud your courage, General Skywalker, but it’s suicide. Once we contain the virus we can send troops.
Anakin: No, Obi-Wan and I can handle it.
Obi-Wan: I concur Anakin.
[They leave Naboo]

THE TWILIGHT
Obi-Wan: Padmé and Ahsoka will be fine.
Anakin: They will be, if we succeed.
[They jump into hyperspace]

Random Droid: All the doors are locked. How are we gonna get out?
Random Droid: It’s not our problem.
Random Droid: Boy, that’s a relief.
Ahsoka (C): Senator Amidala, where are you?
Padmé: We’re right outside your safety room.
Ahsoka (C): Can you get the door open?
Padmé: Go ahead, Jar Jar.
[Jar Jar opens the door, letting the virus in]
Padmé: I’m sorry, Ahsoka.
Ahsoka: Don’t worry about us, Senator. We still have a job to do.
Padmé: There aren’t very many droids left. We saw some heading toward the south entrance.
Ahsoka: As long as we’re able, we’ll help you destroy those droids before they breach the compound.
[Rex hands Padmé a blaster]
Padmé: You take the north corridor, and we’ll take the south.
[They both move to positions]
Padmé: The droids are close. I can hear them cutting through the wall.
[They engage the droids, and successfully destroy all but one]
[The surviving droid is going to open the hatch]
Padmé: Don’t open that hatch!
Random Droid: Ha! Too late!
[They fire at the droid and destroy him]

THE TWILIGHT
[Anakin and Obi-Wan have come out of hyperspace]
Obi-Wan: There it is, Iego.
Anakin: What do you make of this?
Obi-Wan: It looks like a graveyard… of ships.

CLIFFHOLD
[Anakin and Obi-Wan have landed on Iego]
Anakin: Let’s go.
Obi-Wan: Anakin…
[Some battle droids come toward them]
Anakin: Not good…
All Droids: Welcome to Iego. Roger, roger.
Obi-Wan: Anakin wait. Wait!
All Droids: Welcome to I-
[Anakin ignites his lightsaber and starts destroying them]
[He suddenly stops, when seeing none of them are fighting back]
All Droids: Welcome to Iego.
Obi-Wan: Very impressive. You just destroyed 17 defenseless battle droids without suffering a scratch.
Random Droid: Welco-
[The droid collapses]
Anakin: Eighteen, actually.
Random Droid: The venerable Jaybo Hood requests an audience.
Anakin and Obi-Wan: Jaybo?
[A kid arrives]
Jaybo Hood: Hey. You guys have any idea how long it took me to repurpose those droids?
Anakin: [chuckles] You’re Jaybo?
Jaybo: Well, do you?
Obi-Wan: I apologize for my friend’s rather rash behavior.
Jaybo: Nine months, man. It took me nine months.
[Jaybo lies on a hammock, and then claps twice]
Random Droid: Oh, that’s our cue.
[The droid gives Jaybo some fresh air]
Random Droid: Channel 2.
[Some music starts playing out of the droid’s radio]
Anakin: How would a kid like you come by this many battle droids anyway?
Jaybo: Simple. When the Separatists took off, they left all this junk behind. I got a whole warehouse full of ‘em right over there.
Obi-Wan: So you programmed them to serve you.
Jaybo: No reason to let a good droid rust, right?
Anakin: Mmm-hm. Looks like you used a macro protocol to wipe them all simultaneously. Impressive.
Jaybo: I see you know your droids. You’re Jedi, aren’t you? You want me to show you how I did it?
Obi-Wan: Perhaps another time. What we need now is reeksa root. Do you know where we can find some?
Jaybo: Here, there, everywhere.
Anakin: We don’t have time for games, kid. Where’s the root?
Obi-Wan: What my friend is trying to say is that we are in a bit of a hurry.
Jaybo: [chuckles] Not anymore you’re not.
Anakin: Look, you little-
Jaybo: This system is haunted, cursed, whatever. Anyway, Jedi or not, no one gets off this rock alive, not past Drol.
Random Droid: Drol?!
Obi-Wan: Drol?
Jaybo: Yeah, Drol. The phantom ruler of Iego. He destroys anything that leaves the planet. Fifty of the best star pilots in the galaxy have tried. Fifty tried, fifty died.
Obi-Wan: I suppose that explains the ruined ships in the moonbelt.
Anakin: First things first. We’ll have to deal with this Drol later.

[Everyone is fighting together some droids]
Jar Jar: This-a help.
[Jar Jar prepares himself to shoot the droids with a blaster]
Padmé: Jar Jar no!
[Jar Jar shoots Padmé]
Ahsoka: Senator!
Rex: Senator, your suit’s been compromised.
Ahsoka: I’m so sorry.
[Padmé takes her helmet off]
Padmé: Don’t blame yourself. These things tend to happen in a war zone.

CLIFFHOLD
[Anakin and Obi-Wan are going down the cliff to get some reeksa root]
Obi-Wan: Are you coming?
Jaybo: You’ve gotta be kidding. No way I’m going down there.
Anakin: [grunts] You trying to tell us something?
Jaybo: Don’t worry, it’s simple. Follow the vines to the bottom, dig up the roots, but don’t touch the vine.
Obi-Wan: Aside from the obvious, why not?
Jaybo: Because the plants don’t like it, and they have big sharp teeth.
Anakin: Teeth? This is getting better by the minute.
Jaybo: And watch out for the flying xandu.
Anakin: What’s a xandu?
Obi-Wan: I’m not sure.
[A xandu comes out of nowhere and grabs Anakin]
Anakin: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa! Master, hop on!
[Obi-Wan hops on the xandu, and they pull him down the pit]
Obi-Wan: This isn’t going to work!

Ahsoka: I’m all right.

Obi-Wan: There, those are the roots we are looking for.
Anakin: Oh, poodoo.
[The xandu drops them, and a plant prepares to attack them]
Obi-Wan: I have a bad feeling about this.
[Anakin takes a shovel out, and Obi-Wan ignites his lightsaber]
Obi-Wan: Don’t take too long with that.
Anakin: I’ll go as fast as I can.
[The plant is becoming more agressive]
Obi-Wan: Anakin, hurry. Anakin, now!
Anakin: Okay, okay. Got it.
[Anakin puts the roots in Obi-Wan’s backpack]
Anakin: Hold still.
Obi-Wan: We’ve got to get out of here now.
[Some plants start chasing them, but they successfully defeat them and climb up the cliff]
Jaybo: You made it! I knew you would.
Obi-Wan: Oh, did you?
[They go into the spaceport]
Jaybo: The place dried up once the spice convoy stopped running. Out here, we’re just one of the millions of little backwaters no one cares about. Those of us who are left can’t leave because of the curse.
Amit Noloff: Cursed we are, the planet is cursed.
Obi-Wan: Cursed by whom, my twitchy friend?
Amit: The ghost of Drol, that’s who.
Anakin: A ghost?
Amit: The spirit of the thousand moons, our protector and destroyer.
Anakin: If you ask me it sounds like a load of-
Obi-Wan: Superstition?
Anakin: That’s one word for it.
Amit: Superstition, you say.
[Amit starts playing a hologram recording]
Taqito: Can’t hold on much… Someone help me! [the ship he is on explodes]
[The recording ends]
Jaybo: That was Taqito. He was a friend of mine.
Amit: Try to leave this planet, and your fate will be the same.
[Anakin and Obi-Wan leave onboard the Twilight]
Jaybo: Never make it past Drol.

Obi-Wan: The ghost of Drol may be a local superstition, but something real blew up those ships.
Anakin: Real we can handle.
Jaybo (C): Too bad, I really liked those guys.
Anakin: Thanks for your help, kid. We couldn’t have done it without you.
Jaybo (C): Have you run into Drol yet?
Obi-Wan: Not to worry Jaybo.
[R2-D2 blips]
Anakin: What’s the matter R2? Afraid of a ghost? Drol is just a superstition…
[An energy field is triggered]
Obi-Wan: There’s our ghost!
Anakin: Lasers!
Obi-Wan: We’ve triggered an energy field.
[Cliffhold]
[Jaybo: Oh, no]
Obi-Wan: Turn the ship around. We’ll never make it through. 
[Anakin turns the ship around]
Obi-Wan: The Separatists must’ve installed those lasers to prevent people from leaving the planet.

Jaybo: They’re coming back!

Ahsoka (Hologram): Master, can you hear me?
Anakin: R2, amplify the signal.
[R2 proceeds to do so]
Ahsoka (H): Destroyed all the battle droids inside the compound, Master. Naboo is safe from further contamination. I repeat; Naboo is safe. [coughs]
Padmé (H): Promise me that no one will ever open this bunker. Goodbye Anakin, I- [coughs]

Anakin: We’ll borrow a power converter from Jaybo and reprogram it to feed our-
Obi-Wan: Slow down, Anakin.
Anakin: Slow down? Slow down?! You saw them, Master. They’re dying!
Obi-Wan: A great leap forward often requires first taking two steps back.
Anakin: And sometimes all it requires is the will to jump.
Obi-Wan: At least hear me out on this.

IEGO COUNCIL
Obi-Wan: Citizens of Iego, Drol is not a ghost. Rather it is a Separatist security system.
Amit: Nonsense! You were lucky to escape alive! Simple as that.
Anakin: And who says we didn’t make our own luck?
Amit: The ghost of Drol does, that’s who!
Obi-Wan: Did anyone inhabit Iego’s moons before the Separatists arrived?
Amit: The angels, of course.
Obi-Wan: Angels?
[Some angels enter the room]
Random Angel: We were a peaceful people before the Separatists drove us from our homes and stole our moon.
Obi-Wan: And which moon was that?
[The random angel shows a hologram of the Iego system]
Random Angel: Millius Prime
Anakin: The primary node, it must be near Millius Prime.
Obi-Wan: Hmm, vulture droids… Jaybo, can you reactivate those vulture droids?
Jaybo: Sure. I can even fly them by remote control.
Obi-Wan: Good. We can have R2 fly the vulture droids as a decoy into the laser field.
Anakin: And since we know what we’re up against this time, we can destroy the laser emitter.
Obi-Wan: And cut a path right to Millius Prime.
