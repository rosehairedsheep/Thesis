[Scene: Ship's Cockpit. Fry and Leela are standing in front of the couch looking out of the windscreen into open space.]

(00:03) ⨂Leela: What do you think of the view Fry?



(00:05) ⨂Fry: It really puts things in perspective. I mean, from up here an entire world can seem utterly insignificant.


[A small planet splats onto the windscreen like a fly onto a car. Leela presses a button and the windscreen wiper cleans it off.]
[Opening Credits. Caption: Featuring Gratuitous Alien Nudity.]
[Scene: Madison Cube Garden: Stand. The crew are sat watching what could be a baseball game...]

(00:49) ⨂Bender: Hey nice seats! We're close enough so when you knock a player down with a beer bottle, he stays down!



(00:54) ⨂Fry: I don't get it. Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball?



(00:58) ⨂Farnsworth: Baseball?? God forbid!



(01:00) ⨂Leela: Face it Fry. Baseball was as boring as mum and apple pie. That's why they jazzed it up.



(01:05) ⨂Fry: Boring? Baseball wasn't - hmm, so they finally jazzed it up?


[A player hits the ball. Fry jumps up cheering.]

(01:14) ⨂Fry: Home run!! Woooo! Right?


[The ball springs back, a player catches it, flies through the air and hits a base.]

(01:22) ⨂Umpire: Out!



(01:25) ⨂Fry: What just happened? Why is the ball on that springy thing?



(01:28) ⨂Leela: It's traditional. Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope.


[Another hit. A player jumps to catch the ball but misses it and is caught by Bender.]

(01:38) ⨂Bender: I got me a souvenir! [A kid looks sadly up at Bender] Aww here you go kid!


[He hands the kid the player.]
[Scene: Madison Cube Garden: Corridor. Zoidberg comes out of the Gents and walks to a food stand.]

(01:49) ⨂Zoidberg: I'd like a jumbo squidlog please.



(01:52) ⨂Man: We don't sell those.



(01:53) ⨂Zoidberg: Alright, alright. Let me have one of your young on a roll.



(01:57) ⨂Man: We're out of rolls.



(01:58) ⨂Zoidberg: Fine! Just give me something crawling with parasites.


[Cut to: Madison Cube Garden: Stand. Zoidberg is back with the group eating a hot dog]

(02:05) ⨂Fry: Mmmm, at least hot dogs haven't changed.



(02:07) ⨂Bender: Hey buddies who wants popcorn?



(02:10) ⨂All: I'll have some, me, yeah!


[Bender pops then takes a large tub of popcorn out of his chest cavity.]

(02:15) ⨂Bender: Anyone want butter on that?


[He pumps his antenna.]

(02:19) ⨂Fry: Hey I'm starting to get the hang of this game! The blerns are loaded, the count's three blerns and two anti-blerns and the infield blern rule is in effect, right?



(02:27) ⨂Leela: Except for the word "blern" that was complete gibberish. [The blernsball falls into a hole and indescribable mayhem ensues! Fry scratches his head in confusion. Leela writes on her score card. All right! Yes!!



(02:50) ⨂Fry: What just happened?



(02:53) ⨂Leela: Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns!



(02:58) ⨂Farnsworth: He's good all right. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days when steroid injections were mandatory.



(03:05) ⨂Bender: Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern hitting machine!



(03:15) ⨂Leela: Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns! I mean come on! Wireless Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels.



(03:22) ⨂Bender: Oh and I suppose pitching at 5000 was just a modified howitzer.



(03:27) ⨂Leela: Yep.



(03:28) ⨂Bender: You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you won't even let us on the field.



(03:32) ⨂Fry: What are you talking about? There's all kinds of robots down there.



(03:35) ⨂Bender: Yeah doing crap work! They're bat boys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But how many robot managers are there?



(03:43) ⨂Fry: Eleven?



(03:44) ⨂Bender: Zero! [He throws his bottle on the floor and it breaks. A small robot comes out and cleans it up.] And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth! Is it a human child? I wish!


[Farnsworth suddenly leans forward, clutching his chest.]

(03:53) ⨂Farnsworth: Oh dear Lord!



(03:54) ⨂Fry: What's wrong?



(03:56) ⨂Farnsworth: It's...my...new...pager.


[He takes his pager out of his lab coat and turns it on. A holographic image of Hermes appears in front of him.]

(04:01) ⨂Hermes: [on pager] : This is Hermes. A package just came in. Everyone is to return to the office immediately. [The crew grumble. A pigeon lands next to Hermes' image.] Get away you filthy bird! Shoo! Professor turn me off quick!



(04:14) ⨂Farnsworth: I'm sorry what?



(04:16) ⨂Hermes: [on pager] : Argh! [The bird takes off with the hologram. Hermes screams.] See you at the office!


[Scene: Planet Express: Meeting Room. The crew are around the big table.]

(04:21) ⨂Bender: Admit it. You all think robots are machines built by humans to make their lives easier.



(04:26) ⨂Fry: Well, aren't they?



(04:27) ⨂Bender: I've never made anyone's life easier and you know it!


[Enter Farnsworth and Hermes. Hermes is bandaged up.]

(04:30) ⨂Farnsworth: Great news everyone. You'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9. A world where humans are killed on sight!



(04:37) ⨂Fry: Why is that great news?



(04:39) ⨂Farnsworth: I'm glad you asked that question Fry. You see Chapek 9 was colonised centuries ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists.



(04:48) ⨂Bender: Oh so just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a radical?



(04:53) ⨂Leela: Hey hold on. I understand these robots hate humans but how do they feel about humanoid aliens?



(04:58) ⨂Farnsworth: They're not fans.



(05:00) ⨂Hermes: That's why Bender will have to make the actual delivery.



(05:02) ⨂Bender: Oh I get it, make the robot do all the work!



(05:06) ⨂Leela: This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.



(05:09) ⨂Bender: Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.



(05:13) ⨂Fry: Really? Which one?



(05:14) ⨂Bender: Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.



(05:18) ⨂Leela: Oh come on Bender. Last month it was Robomadan and before that Robonzaa.



(05:24) ⨂Fry: Man that one was a blast!



(05:25) ⨂Bender: It wasn't just a blast it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.



(05:33) ⨂Hermes: Now look here Bender. I respect your diversity to the extent the law requires but you used up all your days off when you had that bout of Roberculosis.



(05:42) ⨂Bender: All right, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last one of you for the rest of your lives.



(05:50) ⨂Farnsworth: Well then it's settled. So long everyone!


[Scene: Ship's Cockpit. The ship is approaching Chapek 9.]

(05:56) ⨂Fry: So let me get this straight: This planet is completely uninhabited?



(05:59) ⨂Bender: No. It's inhabited by robots!



(06:02) ⨂Fry: Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.


[The ship hovers above the surface of Chapek 9. The cargo bay doors open.]
[Scene: Ship's Cargo Bay.]

(06:08) ⨂Leela: OK Bender, we're here. It's time to get to work.



(06:11) ⨂Bender: Yes Miss Leela, tote that space barge, lift that space bale.



(06:15) ⨂Leela: Now we can't land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry and me, so we'll have to stay up here and lower you with the winch. And remember: You don't know humans, you don't work for humans, and above all, you don't like humans!



(06:28) ⨂Bender: I'll try to keep that in mind!


[He steps on the winch and Leela lowers it to the ground.]

(06:33) ⨂Leela: Hmm, he seems pretty angry.



(06:35) ⨂Fry: Yeah but I guess I'd be angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited planet.



(06:39) ⨂Leela: Maybe we ought to do something nice for him.


[Scene: Ship's Cockpit. Leela and Fry have decorated it with banners, paper people and beers.]

(06:43) ⨂Leela: There. That ought to show that stupid robot we care about him.


[The phone beeps.]

(06:48) ⨂Fry: Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery.


[Leela answers the call. Bender's face appears on the screen.]

(06:52) ⨂Bender: [on screen] : I'm in trouble. they found out I work with humans and - oh no, oh no!


[He is dragged off into the darkness. The phone cuts out.]

(07:01) ⨂Fry: Oh my God! We have to go down and rescue him.



(07:03) ⨂Leela: No we can't! They'll kill us on sight.



(07:05) ⨂Fry: Well what are we going to do?



(07:06) ⨂Leela: I don't know, I don't know. It's not an easy decision. If only I had two or three minutes to think about it.


[Scene: Ship's Cargo Bay. Fry and Leela are dressing up in boxes and things.]

(07:12) ⨂Leela: OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly like robots.



(07:16) ⨂Fry: [robot voice] : I am fully operational Captain.



(07:18) ⨂Leela: We have to walk like robots, talk like robots and if necessary solve complex differential equations like robots.



(07:24) ⨂Fry: I can sort of dance like a robot. Will that help?


[He sort of dances like a robot.]

(07:32) ⨂Leela: Fry first of all this is serious. And second of all...


[She dances like a robot.]
[Cut to: Chapek 9 surface. Fry and Leela lower themselves to the surface on the winch and come face to face with a huge robot complex.]

(07:49) ⨂Fry: Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store bought costumes.



(07:53) ⨂Leela: Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant.


[They reach the gates of the complex but are stopped by two huge robot guards.]

(07:56) ⨂Robot guard #1: Halt!



(07:57) ⨂Robot guard #2: Be you robot or human?



(07:59) ⨂Leela: Robot...we be.



(08:01) ⨂Fry: Uh yup! Just two robots out roboting it up! [He sort of dances like a robot.] Eh?



(08:08) ⨂Robot guard #1: Administer the test.



(08:13) ⨂Robot guard #2: Which of the following would you most prefer? A: A puppy? B: A pretty flower from your sweetie or C: A large properly formatted data file?



(08:23) ⨂Robot guard #1: Choose!


[Fry and Leela whisper to each other about the answer.]

(08:27) ⨂Fry: Is the puppy mechanical in any way?



(08:29) ⨂Robot guard #2: No. It is the bad kind of puppy.



(08:32) ⨂Leela: Then we'll go with that data file.



(08:34) ⨂Robot guard #2: Correct.



(08:35) ⨂Robot guard #1: The flower would also have been acceptable.



(08:37) ⨂Robot guard #2: You may pass.


[The robot guards fold up and move to the side. Fry and Leela enter the complex.]
[Cut to: Robot Complex. Fry and Leela walk down an empty corridor.]

(08:45) ⨂Leela: Now if you see any robots, just stay out of their way. [An alarm sounds. Hundreds of robots come out of doors from all sides towards Fry and Leela. Another alarm. The robots clear the area.] So far, so good.


[Time Lapse. A robot construction worker is giving directions to a crane which is building a Tetris wall.]

(09:05) ⨂Robot builder: Little to the right, there you go.



(09:07) ⨂Leela: Have you seen this robot?


[She shows him a picture of Bender as a magician.]

(09:11) ⨂Robot builder: Sorry, can't help you. [To the crane.] Hey, watch it! Don't drop that there! [The crane drops a brick into the wall and it disappears.] Aw!



(09:19) ⨂Leela: Come on Fry, walk like a robot.



(09:22) ⨂Fry: I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.



(09:24) ⨂Leela: Robot's don't have bathrooms.



(09:26) ⨂Fry: Oh right. I wonder where they all smoke in high school.



(09:29) ⨂Leela: Listen. Just go behind those garbage cans. I'll stand guard.


[Fry does. A robot approaches Fry.]

(09:38) ⨂Leela: Hurry up Fry.



(09:41) ⨂Resin-offering robot: Sir? Are you aware that you're leaking coolant at an alarming rate?



(09:44) ⨂Fry: Uh...



(09:46) ⨂Resin-offering robot: Well let me just patch you up with some hot resin.



(09:48) ⨂Fry: I think the leak's stopping itself. [It doesn't.] Wait. [Still going.] Wait. Yeah, there we go. [Starts again.] Wait. Yeah!



(09:57) ⨂Resin-offering robot: What sort of robot turns down a free blast of searing hot resin?



(10:01) ⨂Leela: I'm sorry. My friend and I have to go and perform some mindless repetitive tasks.



(10:07) ⨂Resin-offering robot: Sounds like a romantic evening. I won't keep you.


[The robot zooms away and churns up dust. Leela sneezes. The robot turns around and gives a mechanical shriek. Leela kicks it over and she and Fry run off. An Anti-Human Patrol van comes and picks up the robot.]

(10:24) ⨂Patrol Officer #1: Get the humanoids.



(10:25) ⨂Patrol Officer #2: Get the intruder.


[They drop the robot on the ground.]

(10:26) ⨂Announcer: [on loudspeaker] : Intruder alert! Intruder alert!



(10:32) ⨂Leela: Quick! Let's duck in here!


[They run into a cinema]
[Scene: Auditorium. The movie showing is similar to the popular horror movies of the 1950s complete with an all-American college boy and his beautiful yet naïve girlfriend, with robots instead of humans.]

(10:42) ⨂Announcer: [on radio in movie] : We interrupt this sound file to bring you a terrifying announcement. A non-metallic being has been sighted in the vicinity of Make Out Point.



(10:50) ⨂Rusty: [in movie] : Say Wendy. Your chassis is a little scuffed. Mind if I polish it for you?



(10:58) ⨂Wendy: [in movie] : Did you hear that Rusty? It sounded like a human.



(11:01) ⨂Rusty: [in movie] : Relax Wendy. Humans will never come to our defenceless little town. It's perfectly safe to let our guard down - even for a second.


[A human - actually a robot actor wearing a human costume - appears out of some bushes.]

(11:13) ⨂Robot Human: [in movie] Graaah! [It tears Rusty's head off and eats it. Wendy screams.] I will eat and digest you all with my system of mighty organs! Behold!


[It opens itself up revealing human organs.]

(11:24) ⨂Audience: Ooooo!



(11:26) ⨂Fry: Wow the 3-D's great!



(11:28) ⨂Leela: Mine's not working!


[She moves the 3D glasses back and forth over her eye.]
[In the movie the human stumbles around, breathes fire and finally collapses. It has an arrow in its back. Wendy and a Robot General approach it.]

(11:35) ⨂Robot General: [in movie] : Funny, isn't it? The human was impervious to our most powerful magnetic fields, yet in the end he succumbed to a harmless sharpened stick!


[He chuckles.]

(11:49) ⨂Wendy: [in movie] : I'm just glad the nightmare is over.



(11:51) ⨂Robot General: [in movie] : It'll never be over Wendy. Even now humans are lurking in our playgrounds, our breezeways, perhaps even...our movie theatres!


[He points into the camera at the audience. They scream.]

(12:01) ⨂Fry: God help us!


[Scene: Outside Cinema. The movie has ended and the robots are filing out.]

(12:05) ⨂Leela: OK. Keep an eyeout for Bender.



(12:07) ⨂Robot #1: So what did you think of the movie?



(12:09) ⨂Fry: Umm, too much romance, not enough human killing.



(12:12) ⨂Robot #2: Yeah, it was a real chick flick.


[A loud fanfare.]

(12:16) ⨂Leela: What's that?



(12:17) ⨂Robot #1: What do you mean "What's that?"? Its 5 o'clock: Time for the daily human hunt.


[The robots all take out weapons of different sorts and file off in the same direction. Fry and Leela follow.]

(12:23) ⨂Leela: Try to stay with the crowd so no one notices how crummy you look.


[She is talking to a robot that looks like Fry disguised as a robot!]

(12:26) ⨂Crummy Robot: Awww that was uncalled for!



(12:28) ⨂Fry: I'm over here!


[The robots congregate around a platform.]

(12:33) ⨂Robot #4: I heard a human was draining coolant behind garbage can 738.



(12:36) ⨂Robot #5: I heard they unscrew our lugnuts at night and eat them at their human brunches.



(12:41) ⨂Robot Mayor: Welcome to a very special human hunt. We have with us today a guest who's irrational hatred of humans makes me look like a human sympathiser! [The crowd laughs.] A newly arrived refugee from Earth, lets hear it for - Bender!


[Bender emerges from the shadows and stands at the microphone.]

(12:59) ⨂Fry: It's him. He's OK!



(13:01) ⨂Bender: Death to humans!



(13:05) ⨂Fry: Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!


[Time Lapse.]

(13:09) ⨂Bender: Many said I was too extreme when I first called for the annihalation of the human species, as well as some of the more cunning monkeys. But after living on Earth I can tell you that I am, if anything, too merciful!


[The crowd cheers.]

(13:28) ⨂Fry: My God! He's become evil. [Leela stares at him.] I mean eviler!



(13:32) ⨂Bender: Thank you, thank you. And if you enjoyed that diatribe then you'll want to purchase my spoken word album, just 18.95! Act now and you'll get this Bender action figurine.


[He pulls the string]

(13:44) ⨂Bender Figurine: Bite my shiny metal ass!



(13:49) ⨂Robot Mayor: Let the hunt begin!


[Robots rush off with clubs and start to hit bushes and look under rocks.]

(14:01) ⨂Bender: Now. Your basic human is between three and twenty five feet tall and is made of a hairy, oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt.



(14:09) ⨂Robot #1: Is it true they bite your neck, suck your transmission fluid and then you become a human?



(14:12) ⨂Bender: Sure, why not?


[Cut to: Bracken]

(14:15) ⨂Robot #1: Anything in the trap?



(14:16) ⨂Bender: Nothing. Today's active humans prefer a low calorie bait.



(14:20) ⨂Robot Mayor: Well that makes 146,000 unsuccessful hunts in a row. But I've got a good feeling about tomorrow.


[Bender sees a building.]

(14:27) ⨂Bender: Wait, what's that?



(14:30) ⨂Robot Mayor: Oh thats the old abandoned adult book store. Nothing in there except a few mouldy old shreads of robot pornography.



(14:36) ⨂Bender: Hmmm, sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'd better check it out.


[Scene: Porno library. Bender is looking at robot porn - circuit diagrams!]

(14:44) ⨂Bender: Oh yeah! You're a bad girl aren't you?



(14:48) ⨂Fry: Psst! Bender!



(14:49) ⨂Bender: Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you doing here?



(14:53) ⨂Fry: We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a human sympathiser.



(14:57) ⨂Bender: I was. But they let me go when I told them that I'd killed a million billion humans.



(15:02) ⨂Leela: Good for you. Now lets all get back to the ship.



(15:04) ⨂Bender: What for?



(15:05) ⨂Fry: We're rescuing you.



(15:06) ⨂Bender: I don't wanna be rescued.



(15:08) ⨂Fry: Say what?



(15:09) ⨂Bender: I love this planet. I've got wealth, fame and access to sleaze that those things bring.



(15:15) ⨂Fry: But Bender, we're your friends.



(15:17) ⨂Bender: Friends? That activates my hilairity unit! I'm just a machine to you. You're no more friends with me than you are with the toaster, the phonograph or the electric chair.



(15:27) ⨂Fry: That's not true.



(15:28) ⨂Bender: Well that's how it feels to me.


[An awkward silence as Fry regrets what he is about to say]

(15:35) ⨂Fry: Bye Bender. I'll miss you.



(15:37) ⨂Bender: Go on, get out of here before you get caught.



(15:40) ⨂Robot Mayor: Bender, good news. Your album just went gold! What the?



(15:44) ⨂Robot #1: Its the humans!



(15:47) ⨂Robot Mayor: Bender! Do something!


[Bender grabs Fry and Leela.]

(15:49) ⨂Bender: Uh...got you...you muderous...flesh piles!


[Scene: Robot Hall of Justice. Fry and Leela are in a cage. The judge is a Mac.]

(15:56) ⨂Robot Mayor: Your Honour, I intend to demonstrate beyond 0.5% of a doubt that these humans before us are guilty of the crime of being humans. Come to think of it, I rest my case!



(16:07) ⨂Judge: Thank you, Prosecutor. I will now consider the evidence.


[He begins to consider. A blue bar moves across his screen.]

(16:13) ⨂Fry: Hey, wait a minute! Isn't anyone gonna defend us?



(16:15) ⨂Leela: Yeah! I mean, he might not have a case, but I'm genuinely not human.



(16:20) ⨂Robot Mayor: Quiet, human!


[The Judge stops considering. A prompt box shows up on his screen: Sorry A System Error Occured [Restart] The court gasps in shock.]

(16:25) ⨂Robot clerk: Uh oh! He froze up again!



(16:26) ⨂Robot Mayor: Try control alt delete.



(16:28) ⨂Robot #1: Jiggle the cord.



(16:29) ⨂Robot #2: Turn him off and on.



(16:30) ⨂Robot #3: Clean the gunk out of the mouse.



(16:31) ⨂Fry: Call technical support.



(16:33) ⨂Robot clerk: OK, OK. He's back online.



(16:36) ⨂Judge: I find the defendants - guilty!


[The court cheers.]

(16:41) ⨂Fry: No!



(16:42) ⨂Leela: Look! One eye! Count them: One! Not human!



(16:46) ⨂Judge: The humans are hereby sentenced to live as robots live on Earth. They will perform tedious calculations and spot-weld automobiles, until they become obsolete and are given away to an inner-city middle school.



(17:00) ⨂Robot Mayor: Great work Bender! You've taught us to hate humans all over again!



(17:04) ⨂Bender: [uneasy] : Heh heh heh! Oooh!


[The clerk pulls a lever and Fry and Leela fall through the floor.]
[Cut to: Room. It is pitch black. The sounds of Fry and Leela hitting the floor sounds.]

(17:11) ⨂Leela: Are you alright?



(17:12) ⨂Fry: Oh yeah.


[The lights come on. Fry is upside down. They are sat before 5 tall robots.]

(17:14) ⨂Leela: Who are you?



(17:16) ⨂Blue Elder: We are the robot elders.



(17:17) ⨂Fry: You don't look very old.



(17:19) ⨂Blue Elder: Thanks. We try to take care of ourselves.



(17:21) ⨂Leela: What's going on here?



(17:22) ⨂Orange Elder: Silence! Bring in Bender.


[The doors open. Enter Bender.]

(17:26) ⨂Bender: Alright lets make this quick, I'm due at the opening of a mini-mall. Hey what is this?



(17:31) ⨂Blue Elder: Silence! It is time to put the humans to death!



(17:35) ⨂Fry: But the judge already sentenced us at the trial!



(17:38) ⨂Orange Elder: Silence! That was just a show for the public. We are the true rulers of this planet, hand carved from meteorites by the Robot Founders, over four centuries ago.



(17:47) ⨂Blue Elder: Silence! Come forward Bender. You will have the honour of executing the prisoners.



(17:52) ⨂Green Elder: Silence! I concur!



(17:54) ⨂Orange Elder: Here. Use the ceremonial killamajig.



(18:01) ⨂Bender: Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would it be alright if I just gave them a savage beating?



(18:07) ⨂Blue Elder: No! The Elders have spoken. Show us the killing skills than have made you a media darling.



(18:13) ⨂Green Elder: Do it now! Kill them before they bring down our whole society!



(18:16) ⨂Elders: Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!



(18:25) ⨂Bender: Aww! [He throws the killamajig away. The Elders gasp.] I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but not these two. they're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards.



(18:43) ⨂Fry: Damn right!



(18:44) ⨂Bender: The fact is, humans are completely harmless.



(18:48) ⨂Blue Elder: We're well aware of that.



(18:50) ⨂Bender: You are?



(18:51) ⨂Blue Elder: Of course. But they're useful to us as a scapegoat to distract the public from their real problem.



(18:56) ⨂Green Elder: Like our crippling lugnut shortage.



(18:58) ⨂Orange Elder: And a corrupt government of incompetent Robot Elders.



(19:01) ⨂Lime Elder: Duh, that's for sure.



(19:03) ⨂Blue Elder: Quiet Jimmy.



(19:04) ⨂Bender: Well I'm glad we got all that out in the open. We'll just let ourselves out.



(19:09) ⨂Green Elder: Silence! You all know too much.



(19:11) ⨂Blue Elder: Elders: Execute function, control, shift, kill!


[They form a line and things come out of their arms. They move towards Fry, Leela and Bender who back away. Fry suddenly leaps forward.]

(19:19) ⨂Fry: Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe fire on you!



(19:24) ⨂Leela: He'll do it. He's crazy!



(19:27) ⨂Orange Elder: Can they really breathe fire or did we make that up?



(19:29) ⨂Blue Elder: Gee, I can't remember anymore! It might just be from that stupid movie.



(19:33) ⨂Green Elder: Was that the original or the re-make?


[The crew sneak away.]

(19:35) ⨂Blue Elder: I don't - hey! They're getting away.


[Scene: Chapek 9 surface. Outside the Robot Complex, Fry, Leela and Bender run towards the winch with hundreds of robots chasing them. They jump onto it and Leela presses the button.]

(19:47) ⨂Fry: So long suckers! [The robots stand on each others shoulders] Uh, hello suckers!



(19:54) ⨂Bender: Hey hold on a second I forgot to deliver the package.


[He hands the parcel to a robot. It loses its balance and falls, along with the rest of the robots. The parcel bursts open.]

(20:06) ⨂Robot #1: Lugnuts! Precious lugnuts!



(20:09) ⨂Robot #2: Hooray for the humans!


[Cut to: Ship's cockpit. The ship speeds out of orbit of Chapek 9. Bender sees the decorations.]

(20:14) ⨂Bender: Wow, I can't believe you guys did all this for me! This is the best Robanukah ever!



(20:19) ⨂Fry: We wanted to show you that we really do respect your robot heritage.



(20:23) ⨂Bender: Aww, thanks! You do know I made Robanukah up to get out of work right?



(20:28) ⨂Leela: Of course.



(20:29) ⨂Fry: But that doesn't make it any less meaningful!



(20:32) ⨂Bender: In that case - let the dancing begin! [Fry and Leela do their robot dances.] Hey you guys are good. How the hell do you do that??


[There are several shots of the crew taking photos.]
