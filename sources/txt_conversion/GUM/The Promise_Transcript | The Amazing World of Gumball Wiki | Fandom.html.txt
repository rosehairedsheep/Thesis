The Bus
[Episode begins as we see the school bus leave Elmore Junior High. Cuts to inside the bus, and we see some angry-looking students sitting. Scene cuts to Gumball and Darwin standing at the front of the bus]
Darwin: Why is everyone so uncool on the school bus? Is it really that bad to move so we can sit together?
Gumball: That's animal instincts, man. Everyone's protecting their territory.
Darwin: Oh, come on. People aren't animals, dude.
[Darwin walks to Tobias, whose back is only seen as he gazes out the window]
Darwin: Hey Tobias. Do you mind moving so we can--
[Tobias turns around with a wolf-like face and hisses at Darwin, making him fall down in fright]
Darwin: Aah!
[Gumball approaches Carrie. Carrie has earphones with loud rock music on]
Gumball: H-hey! Carrie! [Waves] Carrie! Carrie!
[Carrie sees Gumball, but doesn't answer. Gumball keeps saying Carrie’s name several times, but is not heard over the music. Carrie attempts to avoid him by turning away, but Gumball follows her head]
Gumball: Carrie! Carrie! Carrie! Carrie! Carrie! Carrie! Carrie!! Carrie!!
Carrie: I can do this forever. I don't have bones.
Gumball: [Growls]
Sussie: You can have my seat. [Hums]
[Sussie walks away from her seat. Scene then shows the full bus, with Gumball in the middle]
Gumball: Here's a lesson to you selfish seat hogs! Never judge a book by its cover-- no matter how weird and...bald and a bit...scary it might be. [Walks up to the seat, which is covered in liquid] Thank you, Sussie. You're a gentleman and a lady. [Gets freaked out by seat] Ohh! What is that? [Points to liquid]
Sussie: The leather makes Sussie sweaty.
Gumball: Well, on second thought, what kind of gentleman could rob such a fine lady of her seat? Please, take it back. I insist. [Walks away]
[Gumball approaches Leslie, who is sitting in a seat next to a plaque. His stomach is noticeably bulging, and he acts tired]
Gumball: I've got such a craving for anchovies, and peanut butter! Oh, uh--[Clears throat and gestures to a plaque, which has a sign with a pregnant woman on it] Hurry up, please. I'm sitting for two.
[Darwin falls out of Gumball's shirt, dusts himself, and walks away. Leslie glares at Gumball]
Gumball: They grow up so fast. [Walks away]
[Gumball and Darwin approach Banana Joe at the back of the bus. He looks very upset]
Gumball: He-hey, Banana Joe! How you doing, buddy?
[Gumball holds up his hand to high five Joe. Banana Joe does not respond, and Gumball high fives Joe's face]
Darwin: Do you mind moving up a seat so we can-
Banana Joe: I'd move for anyone except you two backstabbing dweeb muffins!
[Gumball and Darwin gasp]
Gumball: Why are you so angry, buddy? Is it because we didn't defend you when Tobias said your mother is so overripe she's got fruit flies?
Darwin: Is it because we left you at that gas station on the way to Daisyland on your birthday, but because we were almost there we decided to just pick you up on the way home?
Gumball: Is it because we forgot about you on that camping trip, and you had to sleep under a tent of your own skin and eat a bit of yourself to survive? And you waited for three days in the woods, but then decided to walk home, and got lost? And winter came, and you tried to light that fire with that lighter fluid we said we left you. But it wasn't lighter fluid, it was shampoo? And you got frostbite, and that's kinda why you have no feet?
Banana Joe: Pfft.
Darwin: I swear to you my banana friend: by the end of the weekend, we shall discover the source of your anger and appease your wrath.
Gumball: [Sighs] No dude, we shall not. It's our special weekend. [Walks away] And nothing's gonna ruin it!
Darwin: [Whispers] Don't worry. We'll work it out.
[Banana Joe cheers up at this, and smiles]
At the Grocery
[Gumball and Darwin throw food into their basket. Gumball grabs an item from it]
Gumball: Unh! No peanut butter! The more time spreading this stuff, the less time playing the game!
[He throws it away, and it hits Alison]
Gumball: I can't believe you'd go and get tangled up in some menial banana problems and forget about our weekend. I like Banana Joe. He's, like, my favorite fruit. But I'm not gonna ruin the gaming weekend of the century for a weekday friend. Do you remember how excited we were about this game?
[Flashback. Gumball is using the computer in their room. He browses, bored until he sees something]
Gumball: Dude. There's a new "Zelmore" coming out.
[Darwin quickly zips to Gumball's side. They look at each other, and scream with joy]
Gumball and Darwin: Yay-hey-hey!
[They dance, and laugh maniacally]
Gumball: This is gonna be so good!
[Gumball runs up his bedside table, and repeatedly falls down]
Darwin: Dude! Good so much game, can't words say!
Gumball: [Taps keyboard with butt] A-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Darwin: [Licks computer monitor] [Pants]
Gumball: Dude! The game! [Pants] The game, dude! [Pants]
[Gumball and Darwin hug]
Gumball: [Crying] The game!
[Gumball and Darwin hold hands]
Darwin: When it comes out, you and me, buddy, we're gonna buy this game and play it till we're purple.
Gumball: Let's check if there's any more info.
[They quickly move to the computer, and Gumball loads the screen]
Gumball: There's nothing.
Darwin: [Quietly] Hit refresh.
Gumball: [Refreshes] Still nothing.
Darwin: [Quietly] Hit it again.
Gumball: [Refreshes] Still nothing
Darwin: [Quietly] Hit it again.
Gumball: [Refreshes] Still nothing.
Darwin: [Quietly] Hit it again.
[Flashback ends]
Darwin: I know. But what about Joe? He was so angry, he looked like he was gonna get a nosebleed.
Gumball: Uh I'm sorry. Can you repeat that? 'Cause all I heard was...[Babbles mockingly]...and something about bailing on the best weekend ever!
Darwin: Yeah. You're right. I'm really sorry to have forgotten all about your weekend. It's definitely more important than a friend who's hurt. Possibly scarred forever because of something we-- well, let's be honest, more likely you-- have done.
[Gumball's back is crushed by an invisible weight]
Gumball: Aah! What is that?!
Darwin: That's the weight of guilt. [Echoing] Give in to the nice side. Help those unfortunate, and make the guilt go away, my friend.
Gumball: [Back continues cracking] Ow! Make it stop! Ow!
Darwin: Surrender to your kindness, Gumball. It's nice to be nice.
Gumball: [Gets up, but still struggling] [Grunts]
Darwin: [Gasps]
Gumball: Your guilt is strong, my friend. But it is no match for the power of my selfishness.
[Behind Gumball, Banana Joe walks to the fruits section of the grocery]
Banana Joe: Hey! What do you call a fish with no eyes? A "fsh"! [Laughs, then sighs] If a banana makes a joke and no one's around to hear it, does that banana even exist?
[The camera zooms into Banana Joe's sad face while Mozart's requiem mass in d minor - Lacrimosa plays]
Darwin: [Talking to Banana Joe through a concealing smile] Dude, let's have a soda!
Gumball: D-did you say something?
Darwin: What? I don't know what you're talking about. [Through concealing smile] Did you get that? Let's have a soda! Yes, you! Meet me outside by the machine!
Gumball: [Looks around] Hmmm… [Turns quickly around. Banana Joe is nowhere to be seen]
Gumball: Let's get outta here. I'm getting shopping fever I'm starting to hear voices.
[They walk away, and pas by Mr. Small using a banana for a phone]
Gumball: Let's just get the game.
[When Gumball goes ahead, Darwin turns to Mr. Small's banana phone]
Darwin: [Quietly] Good disguise! See you at the soda machine.
Banana Joe: [Reveals himself] [Quietly] Okay! [To Mr. Small] Oh, your mom says "hi" by the way.
Getting the Game
[At the game store, people are lining up. Carrie queues behind the Eggheads]
Carrie: Are you guys here for Zelmore? Do you know what time the store opens?
Colin: [Chuckles] When your high score gets a double-digit, noob!
Felix: Pwned!
[They laugh at Carrie. Carrie sighs, and teleports away]
Colin: This is what happens when you spend all your time flaming people on web forums.
Felix: You don't get girlfriends.
[Juke queues behind them. Behind him, Darwin, and an extremely excited Gumball and Ocho wait. Ocho is so excited he quivers, and bumps repeatedly into Gumball]
Gumball: Hey! Have you ever heard of personal space-oh. [Scared] Hi Ocho…
[Ocho continues bumping into Gumball]
Gumball: Look, dude. I know you have trouble handling your intensity, and we're all excited about the game. But could you JUST CALM DOWN A LITTLE!?
Ocho: I am CALM! [Bumps Gumball]
Gumball: Well that's cool, 'cause I'm really calm too now! [Bumps back]
Ocho: Not as calm as ME! [Bumps back]
Gumball: I'm the calmest man on the planet! [Bumps back]
Ocho: Yeah!? Any calmer, and I'd be asleep! [Bumps back]
Gumball: I'm as calm as a moonlit lake! [Bumps back]
Ocho: I'm the calmest [Bumps back]
[Darwin glances at the soda machine, and sees Banana Joe]
Gumball: I'm as calm as the petal that falls softly from a rose! [Bumps back]
Ocho: I'm as calm as the stream that flows gently past the willow tree! [Bumps back]
[Darwin sneaks away while the two continue fighting]
Darwin: Hey Joe.
Banana Joe: [Gives soda]
Darwin: Um, I know you're angry at us. I just want to find out why.
Banana Joe: Well. I've been thinking a lot recently about our friendship. But I just feel that maybe I- [Sees Darwin sneaking away] Are you shuffling away from me!?
Darwin: Nooo. I feel like it's you who's moving away from us.
Banana Joe: Well, it's true that recently I've felt a little… [Sees Darwin slowly sidling away]
Banana Joe: Could you at least finish your soda, and pretend you care for a second?
[Darwin pours his soda on the concrete, and throws an object at something, breaking it]
Darwin: Hey! What was that?
Banana Joe: I'm pretty sure you're supposed to do your diversion, before pouring the soda on the floor.
[Gumball and Ocho continue fighting in the distance]
Darwin: Look. I just can't hang out right now, but could we sort something out for later?
Banana Joe: Well, I am making a new video tonight. So you guys should come around- [Sees Darwin inching away] Are you listening!? Come help me make my video tonight!
Darwin: Where? When?
Banana Joe: At the gym! At the school, and don't let me down!
Darwin: I won't, I promise! [Goes away]
At Home
Gumball: I didn't need your help! It's not like I got my butt kicked. [Reveals Ocho-shaped mark on his butt]
Darwin: Yeah, it just looks more like a head-butt…on your butt.
Gumball: Shhhh. [Quietly] Don't spoil this moment. I'm gonna open the box.
[Gumball opens the Zelmore game, while imitating its theme. While he prepares to play it, Darwin sneaks away. Gumball sees him in the screen's monitor]
Gumball: Dude, where are you going!?
Darwin: Uh I uh…need to powder my nose?
Gumball: Are you gonna sneak out the window, do something in secret for a while, then sneak back here, and pretend you were never gone?
Darwin: Nooo?
Gumball: …Alright then.
[Cuts to Darwin in the bathroom]
Darwin: How do I get outta here now? Aha!
[Darwin uses the toilet paper as rope, and he tries to jump out the window. But the toilet paper is too fragile and short, and Darwin falls down. He later wakes up from being unconscious]
Gumball: Darwin? Darwin? Buddy?
[Darwin is in extreme pain]
Gumball: Are you okay? That was quite a fall. Lucky you landed on these.
[Darwin gets up on his feet, and his back cracks]
Darwin: Ah! My back! What are they?
Gumball: [Pulls out cloth] BRICKS! Because I knew you'd bail on me. All of this for your bro-nana.
Darwin: Okay. I think I have the solution to our problem. How about we just invite Joe over to play with us?
Gumball: Uh-NO! It's just supposed to be you and me, man! Don't you remember?
Darwin: Actually, that's not what I remembered.
[Flashback]
Darwin: When it comes out, you and me buddy- [Inserted] and Banana Joe-re gonna buy this game, and play it till we're purple.
[Back in the present, Darwin literally brainwashes Gumball. Gumball spits out soap]
Gumball: Enough with the brainwashing!
Darwin: But Banana Joe needs us!
Gumball: Ugggh! For what?
Banana Joe's Video
[Banana Joe records himself in the gym, along with weights, dumbbells, and body-building equipment]
Banana Joe: Welcome back to Banana Joe's Body Jam! Explosion! [Imitates explosion] Title card. Volume 3: Pecs! [Imitates electric guitar] Now, let's start with a basic bench-press move.
[He moves the camera, and demonstrates with barbell]
Banana Joe: Now, what you wanna do is- [Gets squished by barbell] That's an example of what you shouldn't do. I wanted to show you how important it is to always have someone around to spot you. But since I don't have anybody yet, I'm gonna demonstrate how you get out of a situation like this. What you wanna do is [Gets squeezed by one of the disks] Ooh. Okay, that's clearly expected. Just roll back to the side and- [Gets squished by another disk] Ow! It's okay! I'm sure they'll be here any minute now.
A New Nickname
[Gumball drags Darwin into the living room]
Darwin: I don't like it when people don't like me, okay? And I promised Bajayay that I'd help him out!
Gumball: What the- [Drops Darwin] Bajayjay!? You've got nicknames now? You're better friends with him than me. Why don't I have a nickname?
Darwin: But Gumball is a nickname.
Gumball: Not a new one!
Darwin: You want a new nickname? Okay, fine. I'll give you one now! Just chill out, okay? [Thinks] Gummm… bag?
Gumball: …I love it!
Darwin: Sooo can we go see Banana Joe now?
Gumball: NO!
Trouble in the Gym
[Banana Joe struggles to lift the barbell of him]
Banana Joe: Okay. I'm sure they'll be here any minute now! …and now? [Grunts] In 3… 2… 1… now? [Sighs]
[Banana Joe rolls the weight across his body in an attempt to get it off him. He ends up mashing and spilling himself]
Friendship, or Game?
Darwin: Friendship is more important than some game!
Gumball: It's not about the game! [Sad] Don't you get it? It's about us. I just wanted to spend some time together. I guess you don't feel the same.
Darwin: [Grabs Gumball's face] Don't you dare doubt my love! You're the most precious thing in my life.
Gumball: As precious as a diamond dipped in gold [Sniffle] sprinkled with emeralds [Sniffle] and all wrapped in a big platinum bow?
Darwin: No dude. More.
[They hug, and exhale]
Gumball: Come on, big buddy. Let's go, and see Joe.
Darwin: Maybe it can wait till tomorrow.
Gumball: You want to play that game as much as me, don't you?
Darwin: Yeah, and I'm sure Joe's getting along fine without us.
[Meanwhile, back at the gym, a completely flattened, bruised, and disoriented Joe limply walks around]
Banana Joe: They'll be here soon. They'll be here soon!
[He tries to support himself on a rack of dumbbells, but ends up making them fall on him. He gets up, and holds on to another device, but is pushed away. He ends up on the on the operational treadmill that flattens him until it explodes]
Banana Joe: [Weakly] They'll be here any minute now….
[The gym lights turn off]
The Next Day
[In the school bus, Joe is seen in the same seat that he was on at the beginning of the episode. He is fully bandaged, with his eyes and part of his limbs uncovered. Gumball hands him a bell]
Gumball: Alright dude. One ring for "yes," and two rings for "no." Does it hurt?
Banana Joe: [Ring]
Darwin: Do the bandages itch?
Banana Joe: [Ring]
Gumball: Are you still mad at us?
[A bump in the bus causes Joe to accidentally ring twice]
Gumball and Darwin: Yay! We're BFFs again!
[Gumball and Darwin hug him. At first, Banana Joe resists. Then he just sighs. Episode ends]
