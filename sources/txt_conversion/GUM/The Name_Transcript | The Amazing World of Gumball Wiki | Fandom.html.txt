What Is My Name?
[The episode begins with Gumball playing a video game at Funland. He starts panicking and eats himself up. Darwin pulls him up and attempts to comfort him]
Darwin: Dude, chill out. It's only a game!
Gumball: You don't understand, man. I've never got this far before. Look how much I'm sweating. [He is shown to be sweating profusely]
Darwin: Stop it! You'll electrocute yourself!
[Darwin attempts to plug Gumball's armpits, but the sweat flow moves to other parts of his body. Darwin then plugs his nostrils and ears, with the sweating eventually stopping at his nipples]
Game: Round complete! Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Gumball: Argh, I can't beat the final boss, man! I'm weak.
Darwin: You're not weak. You just lack upper-body strength, lower-body strength, and mental strength!
Gumball: Slap me. [Darwin slaps him] Harder. [Darwin slaps him again] Owww! Softer. [Darwin rubs Gumball's face] Okay, maybe somewhere in between. [Darwin slaps him once more]
Gumball: That was exactly right.
Darwin: Come on. You can win this by the power of… button mashing!
[Gumball hits all the buttons repeatedly very fast, making him beat the boss easily]
Game: You win!
Gumball: Dude, what's the point in learning all these combos if all you need is button mashing?
Darwin: Who cares? Top score!
Gumball: Aw, man. it's only three letters in the top score. Mm, what do I go with—"GUM" or "BAL"?
Darwin: Maybe go with the least dumb-sounding.
Gumball: You're right. Let's go with "BAL."
Darwin: No. Wait. Why don't you use your real name instead of your nickname?
Gumball: Great idea! Wait. What is it?
Darwin: What do you mean, "what is it"? What kind of guy doesn't know his own name?
Gumball: You don't know it either, do you?
Darwin: Nah.
Gumball: Then this shall be my quest. I will find out that name. I will stop at nothing! I will leave no stone unturned! I will climb the highest mountain, explore every island, search every cave!
[Gumball and Darwin walk out of the arcade]
Gumball: I will question every man, woman and animal!
Gumball: [On the bus] Fight a bear if I have to!
Gumball: [Walking down the sidewalk] I'll wear jorts! I'll milk a fish! I'll shave a baby!
Darwin: Climb a rainbow!
Gumball: Nnno, that would be ridiculous. But I will lick an owl! I will wrestle a senior citizen in jello!
[Watterson house, the family is sitting at the table while Gumball is still speaking]
Gumball: I'll kick a crab in the face! And I'll steal a watch from a ghost! I'll eat a beard! I'll marinate a plumber! And when they write about me in history books, they will say, "He did what had to be done to find out his real name."
Nicole: Your real name? It's Zach.
Gumball: Ugh...!
The Beginning of Zach
[In the Elmore School Bus]
Gumball: [Whispering] Zach.
Darwin: Zach.
Gumball: [Yawning] Zach.
Darwin: [Growling] Zach.
Gumball and Darwin: Zaach.
Gumball: Za-a-a-a-ch.
Darwin: Za-a-a-a-ch.
[The two of them keep saying "Zach" quickly, back and forth and then contemporarily]
Gumball: Zaaaach.
Banana Joe: [Whispering] Who's Zach?
Gumball: [Whispering] I am.
Banana Joe: Oooh.
[Banana Joe turns to the seat behind him]
Banana Joe: [To Jamie; whispering] Gumball's called "Zach" now.
Jamie: So?
Banana Joe: Yeah. Good point.
[In the school hallway, Zach is jumping around on a skateboard]
Zach: Hey, coach, great game last night!
Coach  Russo: You're not on the team, Watterson.
[Zach takes the ball from her and attempts to dribble it, but ends up hitting Juke]
Zach: Go, Elmore ducks! Whoooooooo! [Gets carted away by Darwin] Hey Carrie, I think we really nailed the song last night. We're totally gonna win the battle of the bands, man.
Carrie: You're not in a band. I'm not in a band. I bet you can't even give me the name of a band.
Zach: Psch, yeah, like… Germany.
Darwin: Whoooo! [Carts Zach away]
[At the cafeteria, Zach skates past the tables and grabs an apple, taking a bite off of it and then tosses it away]
Banana Joe: Hey, that's my cousin!
[Kayvon cries]
[At the school courtyard, Jamie and Tina are playing basketball, until Zach swipes the ball and attempts to shoot it into the basket, but misses and hits a car]
Zach: Touchdown! Whoo!
[Zach skates into the school hallway, and kicks his board, which knocks out Mr. Small]
Zach: Watch out, world! There's a new cat in town! And he's called… [Slides across the floor outside of the school and then drags himself a little further] Zaaach!
[The school bell rings and students start exiting the school]
Gumball: School's over already?
Darwin: Yeah, and you spent the whole day with one eyebrow raised, behaving like a horrible jock. Are you all right?
Zach: Oh, Zach is fine.
Darwin: Are you sure? Cause Zach is kiiinda digesting part of an apple kid's face right now.
Zach: That's cause Zach does what he wants.
Darwin: Sorry, but who exactly is this Zach? I thought he'd be like Gumball but with a shorter name.
Zach: No! Gumball's a loser. Zach is the man. Zach doesn't ask. [Takes and licks Sarah] He takes [Sarah's head falls]
Darwin: Dude, what are you doing?!
Zach: Zach doesn't have to explain himself, [Throws his sunglasses away] because he smells so good.
Darwin: Zach, listen to me.
Zach: Zach doesn't listen. He hears.
Darwin: That's the same thing!
Zach: Oh, wait. What was that? I'm afraid I can't listen you.
Darwin: Wha-dg [Exhales]
Zach: [Clicks tongue] Walk with me.
[Zach puts his arm around Darwin and they walk to the supermarket]
Zach: See, Zach doesn't wait for doors to open. He punches right through them.
[Zach punches the doors, but they open before he hits them. After a while he gets frustrated and stops]
Zach: Metaphorically, of course.
[Zach and Darwin enter the store]
Angry Mob
Zach: See, here's another example. Zach doesn't waste his time. He goes straight to the point. [Zach starts cutting in line] Make way, losers. I'm more important than you.
[Hank blocks Zach's way with his arm]
Zach: You think that'll stop Zach? Well, Zach is like water. He always finds a way.
[Zach goes through the Hank's clothes]
Hank: Oh! Ah! Ooh!
Darwin: [Follows Zach to the front of the line] You do realize you've done all this, and you have nothing to buy, right?
Zach: Yeah, that's why you're gonna stay here and hold my place.
Hank: Hey, kid, get in line like everyone else.
Alison: You've got three seconds to move, or I'll bingo-wing you!
Marvin: Have you got no respect?!
Hank: Get to the back of the line!
Felicity: YOU DISGUSTING ORANGE FREAK!
Banana Bob​​​​​: I'M SCREAMING BECAUSE THEY ARE!
[Everyone in line starts throwing objects at Darwin]
Darwin: Ahh, Dude! Can you say sorry to these people before they get to the heavy items at the bottom of the cart?!
Zach: Zach doesn't apologize. He uses his charm. Can you pay for this, buddy? Thank you.
Darwin: All right, you lovable rogue. Hey, wait! Where are you going?!
Zach: Zach doesn't hang out with losers. He lives too fast.
[Zach rapidly walks out of the store]
Darwin: No, wait!
[Darwin charges after Zach but gets bingo-winged by Alison]
Alison: I warned you.
Zach Must Go
[Back at the Watterson house, an angry Darwin slams the door shut and finds Anais popping out of a boot]
Darwin: What are you doing? What happened?
Anais: Zach. He said he needed his own "hang space," so he threw us out of the bedroom. This is where I sleep now...
Darwin: What?! What about me?
[Anais points to the turtle's lair. The turtle hisses evilly, and Darwin whimpers]
Darwin: How can Mr. Dad let this happen?
Richard: [Off-screen] I'm not allowed to be called "dad" anymore.
[Camera zooms out, revealing Richard dressed in a skirt with makeup and a handbag]
Richard: Zach made me sign away my position as man of the house. What am I now? Assistant mom? Vice mother? Man mom?!
Darwin: Oookaay... What does Mrs. Mom think of this?
Anais: Ask her yourself.
[Darwin walks to the kitchen and sees Zach poking Nicole repeatedly]
Darwin: What's going on?
Nicole: I tried to teach him a lesson by beating him at anything he chose.
Darwin: What did he choose?
Nicole: [Crying] Being obnoxious!
Zach: Yeah, I won!
[Zach runs, hops off Darwin's head, and lands on the table]
Zach: Boom shaka laka laka loka mucka lacka cracker jacka flak attack alack ahucka boo-yah!
Darwin: Okay, man mom, I need a mirror!
[Richard hands to Darwin a pocket mirror and he shows it to Zach]
Darwin: Look at yourself. You're such a jerk now, you've started popping your collar.
Gumball: Ah! How did that happen?!
Darwin: What? You seriously don't remember?
Anais: It's Zach. Zach is taking over. Gumball, you need to remember who you really are!
Darwin: Yeah, the real Gumball doesn't care about winning. He fails, with style! Like that time you tried to cross that bridge in a bucket.
[A flashback of Gumball in "The Curse" is shown, where he is trying to jump the unfinished freeway]
Gumball: Gonna make it! I'm gonna make it! I'm gonna make it! [Falls] I'm not gonna make it!
[The memory rewinds and changes. Zach jumps the gap effortlessly and manages to pull off a stunt]
Zach: Yeah!
[Gumball is now performing an air guitar in real life, then passes out]
Darwin: No! Zach is transforming your memories, dude!
Nicole: We need to get rid of this Zach, permanently.
Anais: One step ahead of you. [Hefts a baseball bat, and whispers] I knew this day would come.
Nicole: By changing his name, to Gumball, at the town hall.
Anais: [Puts away the bat, laughing nervously] Yeah, Yeah, that's what I- that's what I meant...
Zach vs. Gumball
[The Wattersons, in the car, speed down the road. Gumball groans]
Darwin: We're losing him!
Nicole: Okay, hold on!
Anais: Look out!
[A truck blocks the way. Nicole tries to stop the car]
Nicole: The brakes don't work!
Anais: Aah!
[The car's roof gets torn off by the truck as they move under it]
Gumball: [Groans] Where am I? What's going on? Why is Dad dressed like a woman?
Anais: No one really knows.
Gumball: Ow. Why are these in my pocket? [Takes out a pair of wire cutters]
Darwin: [Gasps] It was Zach who cut the brakes! He knew we'd try to change your name!
[Zach takes control]
Zach: Zach is always three steps ahead. AHAHAHAHA!
Gumball: Ugh.
Darwin: No, no, no! Fight him, Gumball! Fight him!
[Gumball walks through a street of a bunch of memories squashed together. The Forest of Doom is to his right and the town, with Kenneth and Hector fighting in the background, are to his left]
Darwin: [Off-screen; echoing] Gumball, don't let him change your memories!
Gumball: [Echoing] And how exactly am I supposed to do that?
[The camera zooms out, revealing Gumball being inside a brain-shaped cardboard maze with his memories scattered around]
Darwin: [Off-screen; echoing] By remembering you're a loser!
[Scene changes back to reality]
Darwin: Like that time Tobias kicked your butt!
[Gumball flashes back to "The Knights" when Tobias was hitting a trash can he was hiding behind]
Gumball: Hey, I remember that. Gosh, I really am a bit of a loser.
Zach: Not for long!
[Zach transforms, and suddenly he's holding a bazooka and is in his paintball gear]
Zach: Well, my friend, looks like you brought a stick to a bazooka fight.
Gumball: What the what?! Stop messing with my memories, you cheap punk!
Zach: Ha! Cheap this! [Fires at Gumball]
Gumball: "Cheap this?" What does that even mean?
[The rocket explodes on Gumball. The smoke clears and Gumball notices his hand starting to fade]
Gumball: He's too strong, dude! I'm fading away!
[Scene changes bact to reality]
Darwin: Quick, Gumball's fading away!
Nicole: We need a shortcut!
Larry: Here's your change, sir. Thank you for coming and GET OUT OF HERE!
[Gary floors it and evades the Wattersons, who speed by. The food in Larry's hand has disappeared]
Larry: Huh?
[Richard is eating the stolen food. Nicole looks at him]
Richard: What? I'm stress-eating! You're not the only one who gets hormonal!
Nicole: Are you sure you don't want to take off that wig? I think it's messing with your head.
Richard: Oh, first I'm fat, and then you don't like my hair?! My mother was right! [Starts crying]
Darwin: Dude, try to hold on to a memory where you lose, like that time when you lost that tennis match on purpose!
[Gumball wakes up in a scene from "The Sweaters." It shows Zach rapid-firing tennis-balls, and they are battering Carlton and Troy]
Gumball: Stop! That's not the way it happened! [His hands continue to fade] Oh, man. HEELP!
[A police car appears next to the Wattersons]
Donut Sheriff: Hey! Hey! Pull over and step out of the stolen vehicle!
[Richard turns to look at the Sheriff]
Donut Sheriff: Ah! I meant, put a bag over your head, pull over, and step out of the stolen vehicle.
Nicole: Stolen vehicle? What's he talking about?
[Anais pulls out a phone from Gumball's pockets]
Phone: Thank you for your call, sir. The officers are about to stop the people who stole your car.
Nicole: Could someone please check he's got nothing else in his pockets?
Anais: [A mouse trap clamps her hand] Ow!
Zach: Zach is always three steps ahead. [Laughs evilly]
[Anais punches Gumball just as Zach loses control]
Gumball: Ow.
Anais: Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Darwin: Hey, remember that time in the tree house when you thought you were kissing Penny, but kissed me instead?
Gumball: Actually, I wouldn't mind if he erased that one.
Darwin: Yeah, me too. Well, try and find something else.
Donut Sheriff: Stop the car, lady-man! We've blocked the road ahead!
[Coffee Cop blocks the road with stingers]
Nicole: I'm sorry! We don't have a choice!
[The Wattersons drive by the roadblock, which was placed on a different road]
Hamburger Cop: Uh, it seems the suspect drove through the roadblock, sir.
Donut Sheriff: What? How could you let him get away? What about the stingers?
[Hamburger Cop drives through the roadblock and his tires are popped]
Hamburger Cop: Uh, sir, I think we're gonna need back up.
Donut Sheriff: Ah, forget it. I'll catch them myself.
[Doughnut Sheriff crashes into Hamburger Cop]
Donut Sheriff: Let's just put in the report that we let them off with a warning.
Changing Name
Anais: Mom, stop the car! The town hall is straight ahead!
[Nicole turns the keys and the car slowly drives into the hall. The car stops, lightly touching Alison, who then surprisingly flies off]
Nicole: Please, we need your help.
Richard: We've got an identity crisis on our hands!
Darwin: Buddy, wake up! We need you to sign your name!
Gumball: My name? What is my name?
[Gumball walks through Zach's edited memories, with him wooing Penny, being the star of the football team, and hanging out with Alan, Tobias and Banana Joe at a party]
Zach: Dude doesn't even know his own name anymore. Just accept it and fade away.
[The paper woman is doing her work extremely slowly]
Nicole: Just get on with it already!
Paper woman: [Slowly] I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm going as fast as I can.
[Nicole angrily grabs the woman's arm and slams it repeatedly on the paper]
Darwin: [Shakes Gumball] Come on, dude! You have to sign your name, or it's not official!
[A memory of "The Fridge": Zach is laughing, holding the flag]
Gumball: I don't remember my name. There's no memory of mine left. He's changed everything!
[Gumball sees the memory of the arcade]
Gumball: Wait! Apart from the time I actually won something!
Game: You win!
[Zach blocks Gumball's path]
Gumball: Not this time, Zach. I’ve already won this.
Zach: But what name did you type?
Past Gumball: Oh, man. It's only three letters in the top score.
Zach: "Z-A-C." It fits perfectly.
Past Gumball: What do I go with? "GUM" or "BALL?"
Gumball: That's it! Gumball!
Zach: Forget it. I'm the boss of this game. I know all the combos.
Gumball: But the combos are useless against button mashing!
[Gumball forges through Zach, pushes away the past versions of himself and Darwin and types in GUM onto the game. It expands to say GUMBALL. Zach begins to fade away]
Zach: Aaaaahh—
[Gumball farts and awakens, then rushes to write his name]
Richard: He's back! Come on! Gumball me!
[Gumball runs up to the counter and officially signs his name on the paper. The rest of the Wattersons then hug him and cheer happily]
Paper woman: [Slowly] You know, you could have just filled this out on the interne—
[The episode ends]
