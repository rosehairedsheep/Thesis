Everything Has to be Perfect!
[The episode starts by showing the Wattersons' house, while Louie is walking his dog]
Gumball: [Off-screen] EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PERFECT!
[Louie to get distracted by the scream and hits a pole]
[Scene changes to the kitchen where Anais is frantically trying to unclog the sink, Darwin is rapidly mixing cookie dough in a bowl and Richard is doing the laundry in the background. Gumball walks up to Anais]
Gumball: I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I'M SEEING! IT'S STILL CLOGGED!
Anais: I'm trying!
Gumball: EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PERFECT!
Anais: I know, I know!
[Anais frantically attempts to unclog the sink, and finally does so, causing the sink goop to splat on her face]
Gumball: NOW, PAINT THE HOUSE! [Throws a can of paint at Anais]
[Anais sighs]
Gumball: DARWIN, WHERE ARE THE COOKIES?!
Darwin: THEY'RE NOT COOKED YET!
Gumball: WELL, COOK THEM FASTER!
[Gumball turns the temperature dial on the oven up all the way, causing fire to come out and burn them]
Darwin: AAH!
Gumball: DAD!
[Richard appears to be messily eating some cookie dough]
Gumball: YOU HAVE COOKIE DOUGH ALL OVER YOURSELF! GO TAKE A SHOWER!
Richard: Again?
[Gumball bites his lip and points to the bathroom, Richard sighs; scene changes to the living room where Nicole is busy tidying up the house using the vacuum cleaner]
Gumball: MOM, WHY IS THE GARBAGE STILL HERE?! DO I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING MYSELF?!
[Gumball throws the garbage bags and Nicole outside]
Anais: The car's coming!
[Gumball screams, then exhales into his hand to smell his breath, makes a disgusted face, and runs to the bathroom]
Gumball: [Off-screen] GET OUT!
[Richard gets thrown downstairs, wearing nothing except shower curtains]
Gumball: [Off-screen] AND WHY ARE THERE TIRES IN THE BAAATH?!
Richard: You told me to wash every part of the car-
[Gumball throws the tires at Richard]
[In the bathroom, Gumball strains to get the toothpaste out]
Gumball: Come on, come on, come on!
[The toothpaste comes out a bit, then slides back down. Gumball squeals in frustration, then throws the toothpaste behind him and looks around frantically, and finally sees a bar of soap, then he sighs, and begins brushing his teeth with the soap]
[Patrick and Penny are driving down a street]
Patrick: Look, Penny, I know you like this kid, but are you sure there isn't a better partner for your medieval assignment? I don't like this part of town.
Penny: Dad, we've been through this, and you said that you would trust my judgement.
Patrick: I know, I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm sure Gumball and his family are lovely people.
[Patrick's car passes the Wattersons' house. Penny and Patrick both gasp]
Anais: Gumball, she's here! Hi! Whoa!
[Anais falls off the ladder, she laughs, Richard is taking a shower in the bushes naked]
Richard: Hi!
[Nicole comes out of a heap of trash bags]
Nicole: Oh, hi! [Laughs]
[Darwin appears on the porch with a sheet of burnt cookies]
Darwin: Hello!
[Gumball pushes Darwin aside and runs down the steps with soap foam in his mouth]
Gumball: [Gurgling soap in his mouth] Hello! Welcome to the Wattersons' house!
[Patrick drives off]
Gumball: [Still gurgling] Wait, Penny, no! Wait! Penny! Penny, come back, Penny!
[Gumball chases the car down the road. Penny opens her mouth to say something]
Patrick: It's a no.
[Gumball cries and finally collapses at a streetlight]
No Partner for Assignment
[At Elmore Junior High, Gumball, Darwin, Idaho, and Tobias (wearing a black and purple medieval tunic and hat) are on the steps, while Penny can be seen walking toward all of them]
Idaho: Tobias, you're taking this medieval assignment way too seriously. Are they your mama's stilettos?
Tobias​​​​​​: This, you rustic troglodyte, will allow me to attract fair Penny to be my study partner.
[Penny walks by]
Tobias​​​​​​: [Gasps] Good morrow, fair maid!
Penny: [Sarcastically] Nice tights.
Tobias​​​​​​: Why, thank you!
Idaho: I think that was irony.
Tobias​​​​​​: No, it wasn't.
Penny: [Calling off-screen] Yes, it was!
[Scene cuts to where Gumball and Darwin are sitting on the left side of the school stairs]
Penny: Hey, Gumball, I just wanted to say sorry, about last night.
Gumball: Last night? What happened? Oh-oh yeah, you were gonna come over to work on our medieval assignment. But you didn't. Psh, I didn't even notice since I was so busy.
Penny: Really? But, my dad said you were calling our house till like, four in the morning.
Gumball: Pssssh. That could've been anyone. No one picked up the phone, so there's no one you can know it was me!
[Patrick comes in to pick up Penny]
Penny: [Whispering] Listen, I can't really talk right now.
Gumball: Why?
[Penny points at her dad to Gumball. Gumball looks confused, and at the same time is squinting his eyes]
Gumball: Are you trying to throw away your thumb or something?
Penny: [Whispering] No, it's my dad. He doesn't really want us hanging out together, and...
[Penny's voice becomes almost inaudible because of Patrick angrily glaring at Gumball. The glaring eventually 'burns' a red dot on Gumball's forehead, but he pats it out]
Penny: [Whispering] See ya later.
Gumball: Oh, hi, Mr. Fitzgerald!
[Penny sighs and gets in the car]
Gumball: I think we got off on the wrong foot yesterday. [Leans on a rear view mirror] If you only got to— [The rear view mirror breaks off] OH-HO! Oh, wow! These things just pop right off, don't they? Ha ha...[Tries putting the rear view mirror back] I'll just put that back on here.
[The rear viev falls off again]
Gumball: [Laughs nervously] Let me just... [Begins shoving the rear view mirror with his body, repeatedly] Try this a bit... Maybe just a little... [An airbag deploys in Patrick's face] Oh hahahaha! Well, at least we know it works. [He removes the airbag from Patrick's face]
Patrick: [Annoyed] Watterson, stay away from my car, and stay away from my daughter.
Penny: [A little angrily] Can I say something here?
Patrick: No!
Gumball: But-
[Patrick drives away; Gumball sighs]
Darwin: Don't worry. You'll pass that medieval assignment. You know the whole book by heart.
Gumball: But I... but I learned it all for her.
Darwin: Well, that was a waste of time. Her dad hates you.
Gumball: Oh, come on. I'm not that bad.
[Darwin looks doubtfully at Gumball]
Gumball: [Groans] Then... then I shall prove myself to him.
[Tobias can be heard laughing, then the scene changes to Tobias, who is still on the stairs]
Tobias​​​​​​: So the simple knave intends to take the hand of fair Penny. Well, they haven't encountered upon Sir Tobias of [His voice echoes] Elmore! Who's watched all the movies made in medieval times. You may have the lady's eyes right now, but mark my words, beef-weighted peasant, before the day is out, the damsel will be mine! [Laughs]
[The camera zooms out, revealing that Tobias is the only one on the steps]
Tobias​​​​​​: Oh. Hey, guys, you weren't listening! [Runs off] I was explaining everything! Guys!
Not Good Enough
[At the Fitzgerald house, Gumball rings the doorbell, and Patrick opens the door and groans angrily]
Gumball: [With sparkling eyes and smiling] Hi, Mr. Fitzgerald! I made you a mixtape and a cake. See? I'm not that bad!
[Patrick slams the door, but Gumball drops the mix tape and pushes the cake through the mail delivery slot. The cake falls out in pieces and splatters on the floor, all over the mixtape]
[Scene changes to Patrick jogging along a street. Gumball catches up to him]
Gumball: Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald. What a surprise, we must jog the same route. Yeah, you look really sweaty. Here, let me help you!
[Takes out a towel and wipes sweat off Patrick's armpit]
Patrick: What the— what are you— Get away from me! [He jogs away]
Gumball: [Panting] Mr. Fitzgerald, I...just..wanna...say...I'm not that bad!
[Gumball falls back behind him due to exhaustion]
[Scene changes to Patrick at a construction site with two workers]
Patrick: So, there were two muffins in this oven. The first muffin says, "Good grief, it's hot in here!" and the second muffin says "Good grief, a talking muffin!" [He and his co-workers laugh]
[Gumball laughs as well, and Patrick and his co-workers glare at him]
Gumball: That reminds me of one time when me and Mr. Fitzgerald where... umh... where... uuh... [Takes a sip from his cup] we were uh... [Sighs] We never hang out.
[Scene changes to Patrick driving home from work. He notices a billboard has changed, so he looks at it. It's a billboard of his company, with crude drawing and writing obviously done by Gumball]
Patrick: "Watterson and Fitzgerald Co. Friendship Unlimited?" What the...?
[Patrick's car then crashes into Doughnut Sheriff's car. Doughnut Sheriff writes a ticket, then Patrick's airbag slowly deploys into his face]
[Scene changes to Gumball going to the Fitzgeralds' house again. Gumball rings the doorbell, and Patrick opens it, only to find Gumball back, this time he starts singing while playing a ukulele]
Gumball: [Singing] I wanna study with your daughter, I know you don't think that I oughta. I'm not that bad I'm pretty friendly, I think that you should be—
[Patrick angrily grabs Gumball's ukulele and crushes it in his hands]
Patrick: [Irritated] I don't care. You are not good enough for my daughter, and I don't want you around her. End. Of. Story!
[Pause]
Gumball: [Still singing] So why don't you gimme one more—
[Patrick slams the door, only to find the doorbell ringing again. He opens the door, only to see Tobias at the doorway]
Tobias​​​​​: I am Sir Tobias of Elmore and I'm here to claim your daughter's hand.
[Patrick slams the door again]
Tobias​​​​​: AHH! Please sir... releaseth my foot... Let not this door stand in the way of true love. Just at least open it a little bit so I can get my foot out.
[The door lock goes off]
Tobias​​​​​: Okay, I'll squeeze it out myself. It's really hard because my toes are swollen now! [Effortfully squeezes it out] Aaah... Ahh... Ohh...
[Scene goes back inside the Fitzgerald house. Patrick is at the stairs]
Patrick: Hey, Penny, what is it with you and boys these days? Penny? Penny?
The Duel
[Gumball walks dejectedly. He sees Penny sitting on the Watterson's doorstep reading a book]
Gumball: Penny! I thought your dad didn't want you to come over.
Penny: Exactly. That's why I asked my mom.
Gumball: Cool. Do you still want to study? Because I know that medieval stuff by heart!
[Tobias slaps Gumball with his glove]
Tobias​​​​​​: Have at you, you cantankerous oaf!
Gumball: Tobias?
Tobias​​​​​​: I demand satisfaction.
Gumball: For what?
[Tobias slaps Gumball with his glove again]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​: For stealing the hand of my promised!
Gumball: [Hissing] What the heck do you want, dude?!
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​: I demand... a duel.
Gumball: I don't want to duel. [Tobias slaps him] Leave us alone. [Tobias slaps him] I'm not doing this.
[Tobias continuously slaps Gumball with one glove]
[Scene changes to front of house, the boys are preparing to joust]
Gumball: If I do this, you're gonna leave us alone, right?
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Hahaha! Only if you win. If you lose, Lady Penny is mine.
Penny: [Calling out off-screen] No, I'm not.
Gumball: Yeah, did you consider Penny's feeling in any of this?
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​: In time, she will learn to love me.
Penny: [Calling out off-screen] No, I won't.
[Tobias sighs, then makes noises with his mouth of the horse's neighing and galloping]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Let the joust commence.
[Gumball and Tobias runs towards each other. Gumball's skateboard hits a rock]
Gumball: Ahhh, woah! [Crashes right into Tobias]
[Tobias gets up, albeit hurt]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​: A worthy foe, but how are you at hand-to-hand combat? [Grabs the broken handle nearby] En garde!
[Gumball gets up and turns around, one of his eyes are red]
Gumball: You're a complete nutcase, man! I don't want to fight you anymore.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Then victory is mine and I shall take the hand of my lady.
[Tobias grabs the hand of Penny]
Gumball: Never! [Hits Tobias' hand off Penny's with his broken broom handle] Oh sorry. Oh, are you okay?
[Tobias gets angry and attacks him again]
Penny: Hey!
[Tobias hisses and the two boys fence each other. Soon Tobias gains the upper hand]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Swinging broom handle under Gumball's legs] Dance for me, jester, dance! Faster, jester, faster!
[Penny gasps and she grabs her book]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Faster, jester, faster!
[Penny throws her book at Tobias' face, hitting him]
Gumball: Haha! Thanks, Penny!
[Gumball gets covered under the trash can by Tobias, who then proceeds to hit him again]
Penny: [Grabs Tobias' arm] Tobias, stop it!
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​: I'll stop in exchange for a kiss.
Gumball: NO!
[Gumball removes the trash can off himself and accidentally throws his broom at Penny, knocking her over]
Gumball: Oh! Sorry.
Penny: [Calling off-screen] It's okay.
[Tobias swings his handle at Gumball repeatedly]
Gumball: Waitwawawawaitwaitwait.
[Tobias pauses as Gumball catches his breath]
Gumball: Okay, go.
[Tobias resumes swinging]
Gumball: That's better. Penny! Penny!
Penny: [Unenthusiastically] What?
Gumball: Can you throw me my sword?
Penny: You mean your broom?
Gumball: Yes.
[Tobias throws the trash can at Gumball]
Penny: Gumball, can we just do the assignment now, please?
Gumball: [Shielding himself with the trash can from Tobias' attacks] Yeah, just give me a second, I think he's getting tired.
[Patrick is driving around the neighborhood]
Patrick: [Sighs] She better not be around here. I hate this lousy neighborhood.
[Penny tries to retain Tobias from attacking Gumball further]
Gumball: Penny, get back, you're gonna get hurt.
Penny: I wouldn't have to help if you weren't losing.
Gumball: I'm not losing. I'm just catching my breath.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Step aside, woman! [Knocks Penny onto the street]
[Patrick approaches the Watterson house]
Patrick: [Sighs when watching Gumball] That little punk again.
[The scene begins to play in slow-motion. Penny gets up, right in front of Patrick's approaching car. He doesn't notice her yet]
Gumball: Penny!
[As Tobias watches, Gumball jumps in front of Patrick's car in slow-motion]
Gumball: No!
[Penny and Patrick both gasp]
Gumball: NOOOOO!!
[As Gumball pushes Penny out of the way, Patrick swerves. Tobias now looks shocked, so does Patrick. As Patrick heads towards the house, past Tobias, his rear view mirror breaks off again, then Patrick crashes off-screen. Everyone is stunned]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Okay, you win. Bye! [Runs away]
Epilogue
Penny: Dad! [Hugs Patrick]
Patrick: Are you kids okay?
Gumball: We're fine.
Patrick: Thank you so much, Gumball. You saved my little girl's life. I can't believe I took you and your family for such a bunch of...
Richard: [Angrily] WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?! NICOLE, GET OUT HERE! THIS CLOWN NEARLY RAN OVER OUR KID!
Nicole: [Also angrily] WHAT?!
Patrick: [Nervously] I-It's not what it looks like.
Nicole: I don't want you, near my family, ever again.
Patrick: Please. Here, let me just pay you.
Nicole: I don't want your money! You come around here...
[Patrick is now nervous as the entire Watterson family angrily complain, yell and protest at Patrick, while Gumball and Penny do nothing but turn around and innocently shrug]
