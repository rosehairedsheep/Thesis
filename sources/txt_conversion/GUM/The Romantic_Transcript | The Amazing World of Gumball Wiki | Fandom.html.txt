Chatting Online
[In his bedroom, Gumball is at his computer, making weird faces while smiling. He is sending messages back and forth with someone]
Anais: Gumball.
[Gumball turns Anais, still making faces]
Anais: Egh, what's wrong with your face?
[Gumball receives a response on the computer and turns back around to type]
Anais: Of course, chatting with Penny.
[Anais looks at the screen as Gumball types]
Anais: When did you guys learn to speak Egyptian?
Gumball: These are emojis. It's the new way to communicate. It's not that complicated. Look, see this? [Points to a message with a hand emoji and a crown emoji] It means [Romantic voice] "Hello, princess."
Anais: Okay. What about that? [She points to a message with a burger emoji, a candle emoji, a cat emoji, and a question mark]
Gumball: It's pretty obvious. [Romantic voice] "Wanna have a romantic dinner with me?"
[Gumball receives a message]
Gumball: Oh.
[Penny has sent two pizza slice emojis]
Gumball: "Dinner is served."
[He resumes typing]
Anais: Wait, you're having a virtual romantic dinner by chat log?
Gumball: Well, duh, if kids can't be bothered to type words, do you really think they'll make the effort to find a job to pay for an actual dinner?
[He resumes typing]
Anais: I'm four years old, and you're making me feel forty-four.
[Gumball types a mustache emoji and an "OK" emoji. He makes a mustache on his face]
Gumball: [Romantic voice] "A-delicious."
[He resumes typing]
Anais: Ohhh.
Gumball: "A toast to your beauty."
[Gumball types a girl emoji and a spilling glass emoji]
Gumball: Oh, no! Dumb keyboard, I spilled the drink! I gotta call the waiter.
[Gumball types a hand emoji and a taxi emoji]
Gumball: Oh, man, I accidentally hailed a cab! It's crashing through the restaurant! No! [Penny has sent a toilet emoji and an ocean wave emoji] It wrecked the restroom, it's flooding! [Penny sends a swimmer emoji] People are swimming in bathroom water! [Penny sends a shark emoji] It's attracting sharks! [Penny sends a party popper emoji and a water closet emoji] This party's pooped! [She sends another message] "Sorry, I fell asleep with my face on the keyboard, better go to bed." [Sighs, relieved] Wait, WHAT THE WHAT?
[His face becomes 8-bit and horrified]
Anais: What is the what?
Gumball: [Still 8-bit] Penny only signed out with one emoji with hearts for eyes instead of her usual three!
[Gumball paces back and forth nervously]
Anais: I think you might be overreacting.
Gumball: You don't understand, I always get three!
Anais: She was just tired.
Gumball: Hmm. So you're saying I should make some, some grand gesture to remind her of happier times?
Anais: Are you doing that thing where you just hear what you wanna hear?
Gumball: You're right! Make her remember all the fun we've had.
Anais: No, Gumball—
Gumball: Oh, what was that? Do it in a clever way with a treasure hunt?
Anais: No, listen—
Gumball: [Giggles] It's a bit outta the box, but I like it.
Anais: Gumball—
Gumball: [Runs out of the room giddily] I don't know what I'd do without you!
Anais: Gumball!
[She grabs a piece of paper from off of the desk and draws on it. Gumball peeks back in and she shows him the drawing: An angry emoji blowing smoke out of its nose]
Gumball: I have no idea what that means.
[He leaves and Anais blows 8-bit smoke out of her nose]
The Hunt Begins
[Gary rings the doorbell of the Fitzgeralds' house. Penny answers]
Gary: Special delivery. BUT TELL YOUR BOYFRIEND TO USE A STAMP NEXT TIME!
[He pulls a cupid's arrow that contains the map out of his butt, gives it to Penny, and storms off. Penny closes the door and opens the map]
Penny: [Reading] "Go on a quest and follow these clues to find the thing you must not lose 'cause it would seem that you forgot a precious thing that can't be bought. There's no reason for this poem to feature a mountain apart from the fact it rhymes with fountain. Brackets 'Go to the mall fountain'." [Shrugs]
At the Mall
[Penny arrives at the fountain. After a few seconds, everyone drops to the floor]
Penny: [Panics] Help!
Everyone: Penny Fitzgerald.
Penny: [Yelps, freaked out] How do you know my name? What's going on?
Felicity, Tony, Marvin, and Alison: [Each saying one word] The - first - time - I - saw - you - in - this - mall - I - only - had - eyes - for - you - this - is - how - my - heart - felt.
Penny: Huh?
[Everyone gets up and starts dancing to music, facing her, then stop]
Everyone: Your next clue is at the bus stop.
Penny: Okay...can anyone explain what is going—
Everyone: [Making typing gestures while making a sitting pose] Now all I have to do is send this video to some attention hogs to do flash mobs. [They pick their noses and look at their fingers] Is that a booger or a piece of brain? Better put it back. [They do] What the what?! Is the camera still on??
[They stand up and make a gesture as if they're turning off something, then resume shopping. Penny looks around in confusion, then giggles]
Penny: [Giggling] Gumball.
On the Bus
[Penny stands at the bus stop as the school bus comes and stops. The door opens]
Rocky: Please come in, young lady.
[Penny giggles, boards the bus, and sits down]
Penny: What's going on, Rocky?
Rocky: I will tell you in the form of a poem. [He begins to read it, taking his eyes off of the road. He turns on the loudspeaker] "This rhyme is about the two of us 'cause we first spoke on this school bus."
[As he reads, he runs a red light, causing a collision between two other cars]
Penny: [Nervously] That's sweet and all, but can you keep your eyes on the road please?
Rocky: [Continues reading] "When you offered me a seat, [Marvin and other cars dodge him] twice as fast my heart did beat."
Penny: Not as fast as mine's beating right now!
Rocky: "Your smile filled me with sheer delight and straight away my heart took flight."
[The bus goes so fast down a descending road that it goes up in the air. Penny screams in slow-motion and the bus lands]
Rocky: "Most people think I'm a nutty fruitcake, but you, dear Penny, gave me a break."
[A traffic light turns red]
Penny: Brake, brake, BRAKE!
Rocky: That's what I said.
[Rocky runs the light, causing another collision]
Rocky: "Your beauty reduces me to tears, your voice is music to my ears."
[Penny screams as the bus almost hits Felicity and Billy]
Rocky: "I hope you felt as happy as I did the moment our two worlds collided."
[The bus crashes into the school, landing Rocky and Penny in the hallway, face-down]
Rocky: The next clue is in the science lab. [He faceplants on the floor]
[Penny gets up and dusts herself off]
Penny: [Annoyed] Gumball.
Rocky: Wait. [Holds up safety goggles] Safety first. [He faceplants again]
In the Science Lab
[Penny reads from a piece of paper]
Penny: "We had our first assignment together in this class. This experiment will remind you of our special chemistry. Mix the liquids and you will see..." [She pours two vials into the flask and it bubbles] "...That chemistry is as unpredictable as we are." Probably should have read that whole thing first.
[The mixture turns into a monster. Penny screams and tries to fight it off with a broom. She loses her grip and is thrown into a blackboard, which has writing on it. Penny reads it while throwing beakers at the monster]
Penny: "Joke, we both know I can't be trusted around chemicals. Please go to that desert place I love."
[The monster tries attacking her so she shape-shifts into a mouse and runs out of the room and down the hall]
Rocky: Hey, Penny, don't you want me to drive you there?
[Rocky screams as the monster reaches out and drags him into the lab, closing the door. He then giggles]
Rocky: [Off-screen] Hey, it tickles!
In the Desert
[Penny walks, exhausted]
Penny: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I'm so tired.
[Penny drops to her knees, looks down, and gasps. There is a message made out of bones]
Penny: "Sorry, I actually meant the dessert place where we shared our first ice cream. I made a spelling mistake in the school lab. I probably should have corrected it on the blackboard instead of coming all the way out here because that would have saved you the journey and stuff. Sorry, I'm running out of bones. See ya there." [Losing it, she giggles, louder, then turns into her Gorgon form and laughs maniacally. She turns back to normal, enraged] Gumball.
Ice Cream
[At the mall, at the restaurant, Penny, who is dried out from walking so much in the hot sun, sits down at a table. Larry gives her an ice cream]
Larry: It's on the house, Miss Fitzgerald. [Winks at her]
[Penny smiles at him, still dried out. After a few seconds, she begins devouring the ice cream]
Larry: Did you notice the message on the plate? Look. [Grabs the plate. Penny growls at him, almost making him drop it] No?! Okay. I'll read it for you. [Normally] "This is where we shared our first ice cream. I got you a special flavor to celebrate. It's peanut, like you were when I first realized how much I liked you. Surprise! The second layer is blueberry to remind you of me. [Penny, alarmed, stops eating] Oh, wait. I just remembered that you're allergic to blueberry. Why am I still writing this instead of telling Larry to stop putting blueberry in your bowl? Oh, my gosh, what have I done?! Oh, I know! I'll put one of your allergy pills in the cherry on top. That way, it balances out. Whew."
Penny: [Off-screen, congested] Did the pill work?
Larry: Eh... [Makes a so-so gesture]
[Penny picks up the spoon and looks at herself. Because of the spoon's shape, her reflection appears distorted]
Penny: Doesn't look that bad.
[She actually looks like her distorted reflection. She puts the spoon down]
Larry: Here's your next clue.
[He hands a piece of paper to her]
Penny: Thanks, Larry.
[Penny takes the paper, gets up, and struggles to walk]
First Kiss
[In the school auditorium, Gumball is onstage dressed as the Beast. His face is sweaty, his hand is out, and he is struggling to smile. Leslie plays the violin]
Leslie​​: Oh, don't be nervous, Gumball.
Gumball: I'm not. It's just I've been standing here with a smile on my face for about five hours now. [He contorts his face] Face...cramp.
Leslie​​: Tell me about it, I've played this tune two-hundred seventy-eight times.
[The violin breaks and falls to the floor]
Leslie: When is she coming?
[Gumball cracks his cheeks and his face goes back to normal]
Gumball: I don't know. The instructions were pretty clear: "I hope you've had fun doing all this, now come find me where we had our first kiss. You got this far so you must really care, now the last thing to do is come meet me there."
Leslie​​: Oh, I see, so you kissed her after the headbutt?
[Gumball flashes back to the play where he accidentally headbutted Penny in "The Shell." Back to present]
Gumball: Oh, good point. But it wasn't a headbutt, more of a blunt trauma.
Leslie​​: So where was your first kiss?
[Gumball thinks, then realizes...]
Gumball: [Gasps] The forest!
Meeting Up
[Cut to Penny running through the forest. It is now nighttime]
Penny: Gumball! [She is running from a bunch of rats] This place was a lot more romantic when we had our first kiss! [Stops running] Wait a minute. They're smaller than me. I can take them. [They run past her] Huh? What was all that about?
[She looks and sees a wolf charging toward her. She screams, turns into her jackalope form, and runs. She jumps over a huge gap, shape-shifts into a flying squirrel, and lands, turning back to her default form. The wolf whimpers and backs away]
Penny: That's right! Remember who you're messin' with next time!
[A bear approaches her from behind. Penny turns around and whimpers upon seeing it]
Penny:  Wait a minute, I can take whatever shape I want. [She tries a Magical Girl transformation sequence] Penny powers, TRANSFORMATION!
[She strikes poses, but nothing happens. Beat. The bear roars at her so she turns into her mouse form and runs away]
Penny: [High-pitched voice] Gumball!
[She dodges a snake and the bear and runs into a shelter of rock. Several creatures close in on her and the rats are seen running. Helpless, she shields herself]
Gumball: Leave her alone! [The creatures and Penny look up. Gumball is on top of the rocks, still dressed as the Beast. He dives down, spinning and flipping, before landing. The creatures back away and Gumball drops to the ground in pain, his wig falling off] Ohhh, I twisted my ankle! Quick, save us with your power of transformation!
Penny: [High-pitched voice] I can't control it! It depends how I feel!
[The creatures begin to close in on them]
Gumball: One last kiss before they eat us? [Puckers up. Penny turns into her Gorgon form] Oh, sorry!
[Penny turns back to her default form]
Penny: That's it! Make me angry!
Gumball: I don't know. I don't think you'll have time to kick my butt before they do.
[The bear roars and they panic]
Penny: Come on!
Gumball: Okay! Uh, your mom is so dense that when you said your laptop was buggy, she sprayed it with insecticide!
[Penny giggles]
Penny: She is really bad with computers. When I told her a mouse was broken, she took it to the vet.
[They both laugh as the creatures come closer]
Gumball: [Still laughing] Your sister?
Penny: [Still laughing] Not my sister!
Gumball: Your sister's so short, she has to roll up her diapers!
[They both laugh]
Gumball: [Giggling] You wanna hear something else funny? You know all that stuff I put you through today?
[Penny is still laughing]
Gumball: [Giggling] It was because you only used one heart emoji instead of three.
[Penny turns into her dragon form]
Penny: [Deep voice] ARE YOU INSANE?!
[The bear roars again. She turns to the creatures and breathes fire at them. A shot of the forest overhead is shown as the fire can be seen. The creatures whimper]
The Gesture
[Time lapse. Penny is walking on the sidewalk, annoyed. Gumball catches up to her, but stays behind her]
Gumball: [Nervously] Uh, are you still angry? [Penny blows smoke out of her nose. Gumball whispers] I'll take that as a maybe.
[Penny stops walking and turns to him]
Penny: Look! You need to take things a little easier, okay? By which I mean less terrifyingly intense.
Gumball: [Cheerfully] Gotcha. No more marriage proposals and stuff.
Penny: And no big gestures!
Gumball: [Nervously, backing away] Of course, of course. [Whispers into a walkie-talkie] Abort, abort!
[Darwin is shown standing next to a fuse that's about to explode]
Darwin: Uh...too late.
Gumball: What do you mean, "too--"
[Fireworks go off behind Penny, who begins to turn around. Gumball grabs her face]
Gumball: Don't look behind you! I mean, [Puts his arm around her] let's focus on the future. [She looks back and he grabs her face again] There's no point in turning back.
[Penny takes his hands off of her and turns to the fireworks. One shoots up and explodes, saying "I Love You Penny"]
Gumball: [Scoffs] Nothin' to do with me, must be a different Penny.
[Another firework explodes, saying "From Gumball"]
Gumball: Heh, must be a different Gumball.
[Another says "Watterson" and Gumball laughs nervously]
Gumball: What are the chances?
[The last one is a shape of Gumball's face]
[Gumball looks at her and she gives him a blasé look. His face turns into the 8-bit heart emoji that she sent him earlier. Penny sighs]
Penny: [With a half-lidded smile] Gumball.
[The episode ends]
