Let's Drop Out!
[Gumball and Darwin are shown walking in the convenient store at TDM Gas]
Gumball: I say we ditch school today. They've already taught us the three key things we need to know— how to do the grammaring of words good and how to count.
Darwin: I don't know, man. I feel like we still need math. Like, say you've got twenty dollars and you wanna buy three two-dollar candy bars. How much money do you give Larry?
Gumball: [Throws money on Larry's desk] All of it and wait for change, like everyone else does. I say we don't just ditch school today, we straight up drop out. Ah! [Accidentally breaks a Gumball machine]
Larry: [Angrily] Hmm.
Gumball: Yeah, well, sorry, but Newton's first law of physics— what goes up, uh, stays in Vegas.
Larry: Isaac Newton would be spinning in his grave, but gravity won't let him. Personally, guys, I think you should go to class. Look at me! Nothing good comes out of ditching school.
Gumball: What are you talking about? You spend all day doing small jobs with no expectations whatsoever! You're living the dream, Larry.
Larry: Given how little I sleep, that's more true than I wish it was.
Gumball: Trust me, man, school is way worse. Last summer, we only had six weeks off instead of eight.
Darwin: Then, it was straight back to the everyday grind, the old nine-to-three!
Gumball and Darwin: [Shuddering] Ugh.
Larry: What about college? I hear it's pretty fun!
Gumball: What's the point of college? Sure, you discover yourself, but it turns out that yourself is someone with a hundred dollars of debt and a didgeridoo.
Larry: But what would you do for money?
Gumball: Same thing that graduates do— take some job as a bag boy at the local supermarket or something.
Larry: Hmm, fair enough. Hey, could you fill in for me while I take five? My doctor says if I don't take a break at least once a year, my heart might stop from exhaustion.
Gumball: Hey, go for it, man! Take longer if you want.
Larry: My doctor says if I take longer than five minutes, the drop in adrenaline could stop my heart.
[Gumball and Darwin, in uniform, laugh behind Larry's counter, scanning items]
Larry: [Sighs] Can I trust you with this?
Gumball: Oh, I don't know. I mean, it looks really hard. Let me fully shut down my brain.
[Darwin laughs]
Gumball: Am I doing this right? More gawping?
Darwin: No stress. We got you, dude.
Larry: Eh. [Exits the store]
Larry's Schedule
Gumball: Okay, we just follow this timetable to the last letter.
[Gumball and Darwin, panting, follow the extremely long schedule which happens to extend over a train crossing]
Darwin: I think that's it—
[A train passing by has a continuation of the same list, and Gumball and Darwin groan. At Joyful Burger, a printer prints the end of the list by the time they get there]
Gumball: Ah, there it is. So, what do we do?
Darwin: What it said on the timetable. Didn't you read it?
Gumball: I didn't say I'd read it. I said I'd follow it to the last letter.
Darwin: R!
[Gumball looks to the list, which says "327. LOCK DOOR"]
Gumball: Oh, good guess.
Harold​​​​​: [Off-screen] Can I finally get some service here?
[Gumball and Darwin pop up at the cashier counter]
Harold​​​​​: I purchased this so-called bottomless cup of soda not ten minutes ago, and yet, I was barely out of the door when I discovered THIS!
Gumball: But there's nothing wrong with your cup.
Harold​​​​​: Are you trying to deny my consumer right to make bogus complaints to get free stuff?
Darwin: Of course not, sir. Bottomless means you can just refill the cup as much as you like.
Harold​​​​​: Oh, really? Then I suggest you have a chat with my little friend, [Slams a book on the counter] WEBSTER! He's a dictionary salesman, got me a good discount on this one. A-HA! Bottomless, adjective— without a bottom! I think this deserves a gesture of good will.
Gumball: As you wish, sir. [Punctures the cup with a fork]
Woman: [Off-screen] A little help, please.
Lost and Found
[Gumball and Darwin change their uniforms and pop up at the customer service counter, in front of an old woman]
Darwin: Are you okay, ma'am?
Woman: I've lost my little Timmy. Can you help me to find him?
Darwin: Sure, what does he look like?
Woman: He's five-ten, about two hundred pounds, red hair, a mustache.
Darwin: Okay, when was the last time you saw Little Timmy?
Woman: Nineteen seventy-five.
Darwin: You meant here in the store?
Woman: No, in New Jersey.
[Darwin looks at her perplexed]
Darwin: I'm sorry, madam, but—
Woman: Can you call him on the PA, please?
Darwin: But how could he possibly—
Woman: Can you call him, please?
[Gumball and Darwin look each other in sadness]
Gumball: [In a microphone] Uh, could little Timmy come to the counter, please?
Woman: You've gotta sing his song if you want him to come.
Gumball: But of course... H-how does the song go?
[The scene shows Gumball's song horrifying the customers]
Gumball: [Singing] Make me a cake and fill it with brisket taste of your hands only sweetens the biscuit
Mama's proud boy, his belly is swollen 
Slathered in butter until it turns golden.
Darwin: I'm really sorry, madam, but I don't think little Timmy is going to—
Little Timmy: MAMA!!!
Woman: Timmy! Oh!
[Both Timmy and the woman hug each other and then flick each other's lips and flutter their tongues while Gumball and Darwin stare at them disgusted]
Gumball: Okay, anything else we can do to you?
Woman: Yes, my baby's hungry. I would like to purchase a cloth sack, a baseball bat, and a possum.
Gumball: Of course, so just walk straight out of the mall, turn left, go to the police precinct, and ask the same question there. They'll give you exactly what you need.
Woman: Thank you. Here's a tip for your trouble. [Gives him dentures and exits]
Gumball: [Throws the denture away] Ugh!
Felicity: [Off-screen] Waiter!
The Window
[In a restaurant, Gumball and Darwin attend to Felicity as waiters]
Gumball and Darwin: Yes, ma'am?
Felicity: I would like to be moved closer to the window, please.
Darwin: Sure! Please change seats.
Felicity: I said I would like to be moved closer to the window.
[Gumball and Darwin grunt, pushing Felicity's chair]
Felicity: A little closer, please.
[They push Felicity's chair closer, causing her to squeeze against the window]
Felicity: I said, closer.
[They push further and her face turns red]
Felicity: Closer.
Gumball: Is this close enough, ma'am?
Felicity: I said—
[The glass window shatters and Felicity falls through]
Felicity: [Off-screen] The view is terrible!
[Gumball and Darwin sigh, and a bank alarm goes off in the background. They gasp]
Bank Robbery
[Gumball and Darwin attend the bank as tellers. The Dolphin Man, heavily breathing, comes up front]
Gumball: [To Darwin, in hushed tone] Oh my gosh, what the what is going on here?!
Teller: This your first time dealing with a stick-up? Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Just follow the procedure.
Gumball: Okay, okay. [Puts money in the bag]
Teller: What are you doing? He's not robbing us. We're the bank. It's our job to rob him!
Gumball: Oh, right, uh, okay. Drop your mortgage in the bag!
Dolphin Man: [Gasps] Please, I have children!
Gumball: Good to know. We'll come for them next!
Dolphin Man: Yes, yes, yes.
[The dolphin man puts his wallet in the bag, but Gumball grabs his arm]
Gumball: That's a pretty watch!
Dolphin Man: No, please! It belonged to my grandpa!
[Gumball closes up to the dolphin man's face]
Gumball: You want to try me? I'll drop your credit score so low you won't even be able to get a loan at the library, punk!
Dolphin Man: Well, at least I'm leaving with my dignity.
Gumball: No, we'll have that too. Your pants— put 'em in the bag.
[Dolphin Man puts his pants in the bag and hurries away in tears]
Gumball: [Shuddering] Ugh. I feel dirtier than a rat who joined law enforcement, but actually had family connections to the mob and was turning police evidence over to the gangsters.
Darwin: You mean like a rat who was a rat.
Gumball: Yeah, I guess that's a better way of saying it.
Teller: Boys, I am very disappointed in you. You forgot to sell him a payday loan at a thousand percent interest.
[Gumball and Darwin shudder]
Gumball: Disgusting.
Mister Small​: [Off-screen] This is unacceptable!
Pet Store
[The scene begins with Mr. Small in the pet store. Gumball and Darwin walk onscreen with new uniforms on yet again]
Gumball: What seems to be the problem, sir?
Mister Small​: This place is a scandal. All of Mother Nature's creatures deserve to be free. Run, my eight-legged brothers! [Gets bitten by spiders] Aaaaah! Go, you're free! [Gets squeezed by snakes] Fly! [Gets attacked by birds] [Turns over to dogs with puppy eyes] Ah, ah, ah! Maybe these little guys will be more grateful.
[The dogs and all the other animals attack him and leave]
Darwin: Well, I hope that was worth it.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​: Yes, because they're all free!
Gumball: No, they're not. They were twelve thousand dollars.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​: Do you have a return policy?
Gumball: Yep, you bring them to the store and get your money back.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​: Glad I didn't pay upfront! [Faints]
[Gumball and Darwin sigh as a phone is ringing in the background]
Order Up!
[Gumball and Darwin pop up as cashiers at Fervidus Pizza]
Gumball: Fervidus Pizza, may I take your order? Sure, one pepperoni pizza coming up!
[Gumball and Darwin end up delivering the pizza in the middle of the desert]
Darwin: Are you sure this is the right address?
[Gumball picks up a ringing cellphone]
Pilot: Good afternoon. I'm on my way. Can you hold up your hand, please?
Gumball: Sure. Uh, Darwin, raise your hand so she can see us.
[Darwin raises his hand]
Pilot: No, your other hand, the one holding the pizza.
[Darwin shrugs and holds up his other hand. A plane comes, causing Gumball and Darwin to scream. The dust settles and the pizza is gone, having been taken by the pilot of the plane. Gumball and Darwin cough. Darwin sits on the ground and rocks back and forth, shaken up by what had just happened]
Pilot: Thanks. I'm a pilot, you see, but I hate airplane food.
Gumball: Wait, what about the money?
Pilot: I just dropped it off.
Gumball: Where?
Pilot: Somewhere over Reno. Over and out. [Hangs up]
Darwin: So it turns out that wearing a store uniform is the grown-up version of having a sign on your back that says "kick me."
Gumball: Yeah, I think the sign would say something ruder than that.
Black Friday Terror
[Yelling and banging can be heard through the supermarket entrance]
Man: [Off-screen] Let us in! It's nine a.m.!
Darwin: Dude, what's today's date?
Gumball: Friday, November twenty-fourth. [Gasps] The Black Friday sales!
All: [Off-screen] Sale! Sale! Sale! Sale!
Gumball: What's our motto, soldier?!
Darwin: Semper satisfy, sir!!
[The mob year through the gates, start to flood the supermarket and cause complete chaos. Gumball cries in terror]
Gumball: War is sales.
In the Hall of the Shopping Slaves
[A register rings. Gumball and Darwin serve as cashiers at the TDM Gas convenience store, with a cowboy nearby]
Darwin: Okay, that's one full tank of gas. Is there anything else, sir?
Cowboy: Yeah, I'd like the keys to your restroom, please.
[Hall of the Mountain King starts to play. Gumball, after cleaning the bathroom, sticks a sign not allowing handstands on the toilet. Darwin, a delivery boy, rings the doorbell, carrying a box]
Darwin: [Reading] "If no one answers, leave in safe place. Go around the back, climb the ladder, cross the road, jimmy the window open, crawl in the room, and leave the package."
[Darwin climbs through the window to find an immobile Melted Cheese Guy]
Darwin: [Screams] Oh, can I have a signature, please?
Melted Cheese Guy: Eh.
Darwin: Oh, right, okay. [Slides clipboard under his hand] [Slips pen into his fingers and writes the signature himself] Are you sure you're not taking this too far?
Melted Cheese Guy: Your website says once you click, you don't have to lift a finger again. Now open the box and take out the nail clippers. I ain't lifting a toe either. [Darwin looks, disgusted and surprised]
[Gumball sticks a sign preventing planking on the toilet seat. He and Darwin then open up a theater room to find popcorn everywhere]
Gumball: Like how?!
[A flashback reveals an Ice Cream Guy throwing a popcorn kernel in his mouth to impress his lover]
Ice Cream Guy: Hmm?
[The Ice Cream Girl giggles. All the other men try to throw their entire popcorn basket to impress their lovers]
Julius, Patrick, Mr. Verde, Jeff, Quattro, Harold​​​​​​​​​, and Cowboy: Hmm?
[Gumball sticks a sign on the bathroom door, preventing jetpack usage on the toilet. Cuts to Gumball and Darwin working at the Bobert store]
Darwin: Oh, this one's not so hard.
Gumball: Yeah, the robots do all the work.
Goblin: Exactly. That's why we don't need you anymore.
[Gumball and Darwin sigh. Darwin exits out of an operating theater in the hospital, he then wipes out his pupils amd faints. Gumball sticks a sign on the bathroom door, preventing cows on the toilet. A montage shows all the different jobs Gumball and Darwin endure through. Larry enters the convenience store]
Larry: Uh, guys?
[Gumball jumps on Larry from behind the counter grabbing him by the shirt]
Gumball: What the what, Larry?! You— you said you'd be gone for five minutes.
Larry: It was five minutes.
Gumball: Are you kidding me?! We had time to grow crow's feet!
[Gumball and Darwin show Larry their wrinkled faces]
Larry: Oh! You thought wrinkles were caused by aging! No, kids, it's from your face contorting from the pain of knowing you're selling the majority of your time on Earth for seven dollars an hour.
Gumball: Larry, how do you do this day in, day out?!
Larry: I find that the low-level terror of not being able to pay my rent is a great motivator. You see, if I had stayed at school, I'd have a well-paid job, and then it wouldn't be so hard for me to buy the things everyone wants in life— a cool car, a nice condo, a big TV, designer clothes, the latest phone, a second TV for the bedroom...
Darwin: Ah, I see what you did there, Larry. You got us to try your jobs to teach us a lesson.
Larry: Maybe. And what was the lesson?
Gumball: [He and Darwin are back in their regular outfits and wearing their backpacks] That we should go to school because we need to learn more in order to find jobs that fulfill our souls so we don't have to waste our lives running after money in order to buy pointless stuff to fill the gaping holes of our existential dread, like you do!
Larry: Yes!
Darwin: Thanks, Larry!
[Gumball and Darwin exit the store]
Larry: [Frowns] Yeah. Right. Okay. Good.
[The episode ends]
