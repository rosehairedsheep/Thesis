What Is Going On?!
[The episode starts on the school bus. Gumball is eating an ice cream sundae]
Gumball: I'm just saying, how did anybody ever name anything? Was some caveman like, [derpy voice, holds up his spoon] "Hey guys! I'm gonna call this thing a spoon!" and everyone else was like, [derpy voice] "Deal!" There needs to be some logic so you know what stuff is for! I would've called them mouth shovels.
Darwin: Agreed. Like...moths should be called goth butterflies!
Gumball: Beards should be called mouth curtains!
Darwin: Puppies should be called doglets! But what about stuff that doesn't already have a name? Like... that stage you're in when you go to pee-pee in the night but you're still trying to stay asleep so you can go back to bed right away?
Gumball and Darwin: Hmmm... Sleep-pee-peeing!
[Later, in the music room, Gumball and Darwin are bored]
Gumball: What do you reckon would be your music fish name? Cod Cobain? [They laugh]
Darwin: Lil Whale?
Gumball: Sharkira?
Darwin: Salmon and Carpfunkel? [They laugh again]
[At lunch, in the cafeteria]
Gumball: Dude, this pizza is so frozen I can't tell if that's Parmesan or ice crystals!
Darwin: And this pepperoni is saltier than texting the letter K as a reply!
Gumball: Yeah! And this corn is— [He suddenly freezes] Dude, I— I can't think of anything!
Darwin: Try harder!
Gumball: Aaaahhhh— [He freezes again, and a tumbleweed comes out of his mouth.]
Darwin: Okay, I'll try to come up with something to say then. [He inhales, but freezes as well and coughs up a "save file" icon]
Gumball: Dude.
Gumball and Darwin: What is going on?!
[That night, they are still trying to come up with something to say, but only end up crumpling themselves up]
Gumball: One last time. [They try again, but crumple themselves inside out. They start panicking]
Darwin: Gumball! What's happening to us?!
Gumball: I don't know, man! It's like we've run out of things to say to each other! [They both gasp and a dramatic music sting plays]
Therapy with Mr. Wilson
[Gumball and Darwin are at Harold Wilson's psychotherapy office. The boys are sitting on a couch, and Harold shows them a picture of a house]
Harold​​​​​​: Try to think of your relationship in terms of a house. You need to have strong foundations, ideally with a man-cave. You also need space. Two stories with a screening room for movie night should do, right?
Gumball and Darwin: [uneasily] Yeah...
Harold​​​​​​: And how about a hot tub for the winter? And a swimming pool for summer!
Gumball and Darwin: [excited] Yeah!
Harold​​​​​​: Great! [holds out a clipboard] Sign this, please. [Gumball signs]Now, let me talk you through the process. We start with you as you are right now, with a problem. Then we exchange. Then you leave happily. Does that sound good?
Gumball and Darwin: Yeah, I think so!
Harold​​​​​​: Great! So let's exchange.
Gumball: Well, it seems we've run out of things to say, and—
Harold​​​​​​: B-b-b-b-bep. I meant exchange my services for your money.
Gumball: Oh, sorry. Yes, of course. [Hands Harold a stack of bills]
Harold​​​​​​: Very good.
Gumball: So, yeah, this never used to happen to us, but now it's like—
Harold​​​​​​: And now, goodbye. [He pushes them out of his office]
Gumball: W-wait! What about all that "building a house" stuff?
Harold​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Oh, we're building all right. My pool house! [excitedly holds up the house picture from before, sing-song voice] By-ye! [dashes back in]
An "Alternative" Approach
[Gumball and Darwin are crossing the street]
Darwin: Okay, what if we try something a little more...off the charts?
Gumball: No. Please. Not him.
Darwin: Look, science'll let us down! We might as well give him a chance.
Gumball: Please. Don't say it!
Darwin: [whispers softly] Alternative...
Gumball: No!
Darwin: [Whispers] Alternative medicine. [The ground starts to rumble]
Gumball: Please! NO!
Darwin: [whispers very slowly] Alternative...medicine.
[A cloud of dust rushes forward, blowing through everything in its path. It's Mr. Small, zooming towards them like a bullet. He dives up and lands right in between them.]
Mister Small: Did someone say...alternative medicine?
[The three are now sitting on yoga mats in a grassy patch by the forest.]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: So, you're saying you have no wind in your sails.
Darwin: Yes.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: The train won't leave the station.
Darwin: Yes.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: The goose is stuck in the hammock.
Darwin: Yes....?
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: The potato is wedged in your tailpipe.
Darwin: I'm not sure what we're talking about anymore.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: You've got trouble talking.
Darwin: [sighs] Yes.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Hmm...I see. I think we need to release the holisticness of your third eye chakras in order to boost your auras and stimulate the flow of chi to your tongue.
Darwin: What does that mean?
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [off-screen] It means this.
[Gumball and Darwin are now covered in acupuncture needles and surrounded by healing crystals. Smoke is coming off of them.]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: How do you feel?
Gumball: Like I got punctured two hundred times and set on fire.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: I meant between the two of you.
Gumball: Uh-a...ugh... No...still got nothing to say to him.
Darwin: Me neither.
Gumball: Wait. Wait! I can feel something coming!
Darwin: Yeah! Me too! It's like my tongue is tingling!
[They open their mouths eagerly, expecting to say something, but after a long period of time, their tongues rapidly inflate in the shape of noses. each an inside-out nose.]
Gumball: [muffled] Mr. Small! What's going on?
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Hmm. That's really weird. I've done this procedure three times before and all my other patients had exactly the same result. What are the odds? [Gumball starts panicking] But don't panic, their lives went back to normal very quickly. [The two sigh in relief] Once they accepted that this was their life now.
[Cut to Gumball and Darwin at night, walking out of a shady "doctor's office" in an alleyway, looking scarred.]
Gumball: You know, Darwin? As that backstreet doctor was finally draining the excess fluid out of our screaming faces using that grease-coated bicycle pump, I had an eye-opening moment.
Darwin: Tell me about it. My eyes are still popping out in shock.
Gumball: No, I mean that man had no diploma. He was just pretending to be a doctor.
Darwin: So?
Gumball: [getting an idea] So what if we pretended too?
Keeping It Interesting
[The next afternoon. Gumball and Darwin are walking down the sidewalk]
Darwin: I don't get it!
Gumball: Well, you know how we can't keep up with conversa.....
Darwin: Yeah, it goes limper than an animator's handshake. [His leg is erased off and he falls down]
Gumball: Exactly. But what if it wasn't us doing the talking?
Darwin: What do you mean?
[Cut to the two in their bedroom, both on laptops]
Gumball: Roleplaying! If it works for fedora wizards in some basement, why not us?
Darwin: Who are you gonna be, then?
Gumball: I'm Akane Ryuuku. A shy anime kawaii girl who likes corgis and friendship. [Shows his profile]
Darwin: Okay, let's go. [He starts typing as his character, Sleve McDichael] Hey!
Gumball: [as Akane, reading what he is typing] Oh...H-hey. I'm Akane-chan. I'm not used to talk to people. Heh-heh! Asterisk, blushes and turns away.
Darwin: [as Sleve McDichael] Congratulations! You've win E-phone black edition!
Gumball: [as Akane] Sugoi! Thank you, Sleve McDichael sempai! It's the first time someone makes Akane-chan a present. Asterisk, looks away all flustered. You want to be friends with Akane?
Darwin: [as Sleve McDichael] What? My message not going through? [sends a link] Chat with me now and win dollars, dollars, dollars!
Gumball: What?!
Darwin: Click link and talk!
[Gumball shrugs and clicks the link, but it opens an influx of viruses. His laptop starts snapping at him, steals his wallet, and then explodes.]
Gumball: DUDE!! WHAT THE WHAT WERE YOU ROLEPLAYING?!
Darwin: [innocently] A bot!
Gumball: [with large anime eyes] So even Akane's conversation wasn't real? Asterisk, bashes head on wall in anguish! [He does so] Asterisk, and realize it hurts more in real life than in writing! [flops over]
[Later, they are eating. They both try to come up with something, but fail once again. Nicole walks up to Richard, who is lying on the couch.]
Nicole: Richard honey, if it's pretty much all you do, you need to watch the way you sit. You should have a straight back and your knees at a 90-degree angle. It's important for your legs and hips to be in the correct position.
Richard​: Uhh. [He copies Nicole's position, but while still sitting sideways.]
Nicole: Ugh. Still some kind of improvement, I guess.
[In the dining room. Gumball slams his hands on the table]
Gumball: Dude! That's it! Maybe all it takes is for us to change position a little!
[They are both standing upside down]
Gumball: Uh, do you feel anything?
Darwin: No.
[They are lying down with their feet against each other's faces]
Gumball: How about now?
Darwin: No. Maybe a little shame.
[Now Gumball is kneeling and Darwin has his foot on Gumball's face]
Gumball: No?
Darwin: No.
[Now Gumball's head is inside Darwin's mouth]
Gumball: No?
Darwin: No.
[They rapidly go through many other positions]
Gumball: No?
Darwin: No.
Gumball: How's that?
Darwin: Look. 
Gumball: What? 
Darwin: Maybe what we really need is... 
Gumball: Please! Don't say it. 
Darwin: [Music starts in the background] I have to! 
Gumball: [with big wet eyes] Please don't! 
Darwin: I have to! Otherwise you won't actually know what I mean. 
Gumball: I already know what you're gonna say. You mean...
