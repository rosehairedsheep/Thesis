Peer Pressure
[The episode opens in the school cafeteria. Gumball and Darwin, seated at a table, are in the middle of a conversation]
Gumball: Right. How 'bout this? I can guess the time.
Darwin: Okay, what time is it?
Gumball: [Strains his mind] Friday.
Darwin: Dude, I don't think that counts as a special talent.
Gumball: How about this? I can bend spoons using my mind. [Grunts; Twists a spoon with his hands]
Darwin: Uh, I thought you were gonna use your mind.
Gumball: I did. My mind told my hands to bend the spoon.
Darwin: That doesn't count.
[Gumball sighs, and they head to the playground. On a bench, Gumball is lost in thought, observing some pigeons]
Gumball: Oh-oh-oh! I can talk to animals! [Approaches a bird; Cooing] Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?
Darwin: Dude, that's not talking to animals, that's talking at animals.
[Gumball and Darwin are at the sports field, along with Coach Russo and some of their classmates]
Gumball: I can crack my neck! [Demonstrates; His head hangs limp] Once.
Darwin: [Fixes Gumball] Why is it so important for you to have a special talent all of a sudden?
Gumball: Because everyone else has one!
[While Gumball speaks, the students in question display their abilities]
Gumball: Carrie can go through stuff. Clayton can shape-shift. And even Alan can float! I'm like a superhero whose only power is converting oxygen to carbon dioxide.
Darwin: That sounds cool!
Gumball: It's just breathing, dude.
[The bell rings, and school lets out. Gumball and Darwin are on the steps leading to the main entrance]
Darwin: You could learn a talent. How about art?
Gumball: We both know how that ended last time.
[During the flashback, Gumball is in the art room with Mr. Small. Above them, a model of planet Earth is suspended from the ceiling and engulfed in flames]
Gumball: I call it, "Global Warming."
[The rope snaps, and the globe rolls across the floor, spreading its fire. Screaming, the class races for the fire escape, but the door is actually painted on the wall]
Banana Joe: Aah! What is that?!
Gumball: That's my second piece. It's called, "No Escape."
[As the blaze intensifies, the memory ends]
Gumball: People just aren't ready for me.
Darwin: How 'bout your party trick?
Gumball: Oh, this? [Stands; Talks out of his backside] That's not so much a talent as it is a medical condition.
[They both sigh, and a noise from above catches their attention. Mrs. Jötunheim flies down on her broom, landing at Hector's feet]
Mrs. Jötunheim: Hi, honey.
Hector: Hi, Mom. What's for dinner?
Mrs. Jötunheim: Broccoli for me, trees for you.
[She casts a spell, causing Hector to vanish, then takes off once more]
Gumball: [Gasps; Quietly] That's what I'm gonna do!
Darwin: I'm not sure making school children disappear is a talent you want to have.
Gumball: No, dude! I'm gonna learn magic!
Darwin: [Incredulous] What?
Gumball: You know, I'll be like that boy in the book who was told he was special by a bearded guy who took him to a big castle to learn magic.
Darwin: Oh yeah! The nice boy with the scar and the spectacles.
Gumball: [Scoffs] No! The butt-kicking one with the snake and no nose.
Darwin: Oh yeah... No wait, what?!
Witch Trial & Tribulation
[Gumball and Darwin walk up to the enormous cavern that Hector calls home. Inside, his mother can be heard cackling loudly]
Darwin: [Worried] Dude, this sounds like trouble.
[Inside the cave, Mrs. Jötunheim is shown browsing the internet via crystal ball]
Mrs. Jötunheim: Ah, what's next? [Reads headline] "Ten ridiculous objects wuggles use instead of magic." [Swipes up; Cackles] They eat turkey for the winter solstice instead of children?
[Her laughter persists until an error message pops up]
Mrs. Jötunheim: Ah, derpadabra, I've lost the witch-fi.
[Lifting the ball up, she backs out of the chamber]
Mrs. Jötunheim: Tsk. Come on, there's gotta be a signal around here somewhere.
[Mrs. Jötunheim enters the tunnel where Gumball and Darwin are waiting, concealed by shadow. She turns around and recoils upon seeing them, dropping the crystal ball]
Mrs. Jötunheim: AHH! [Huffs] What are you doing here?
Gumball: Teach me!
Mrs. Jötunheim: Oh, I'll teach you... [Blasts them outside with a spell] Some manners!
Gumball: But I brought all this witching stuff! [Collects his backpack] Eye of newt, toe of frog, wool of bat.
Darwin: [Contrite] They'll never let us back in the zoo after this.
Gumball: [Imploring] Please, ju-just give me a chance.
Mrs. Jötunheim: Beat it! You don't have what it takes.
Gumball: No! I'm gonna prove to you that I'm worthy! Try me.
Mrs. Jötunheim: No!
Gumball: [Ranting] Witch trial! Witch trial! Witch trial! Witch trial!
Mrs. Jötunheim: [Exits the cave] All right, okay, fine. You can come in. Just stop screaming that on my doorstep.
[Inside, the brothers are hand-washing an assortment of dishes]
Darwin: I really don't see how this will teach you magic.
Gumball: Uh, duh! It's teaching our hands to make perfect circular motions for spells. Right, Mrs. Jötunheim?
Mrs. Jötunheim: [Off in the distance] Ehh.
[The two are now in a corridor, sweeping away some dust]
Darwin: I think she's just using us to get her chores done.
Gumball: Why would she make us sweep the floor, if not to teach us how to fly on a broomstick?
[In the washroom, Gumball and Darwin are fighting to clean a living, monstrous latrine, with toilet brushes]
Darwin: Yeah, I know what you're gonna say. This is teaching us how to wave a wand or something.
Gumball: [Interrupts] Bup-up-up! Sounds like someone needs a little motivational song.
[He uses his brush as an imitation guitar and imitates a riff while rock music plays in the background. During the song, they continue to work through the supernatural variations of otherwise menial tasks]
Lyrics: So you've got a new ambition to become a great magician
But first you must do time for Mrs. Jötunheim
You need to beat away the dust if you want to earn the trust
Of the wizard and the druid, so get out your cleaning fluids
If you wanna a crystal ball, be sure to clean it all
Do your chosen focus to learn the hocus-pocus
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whoo
Get down and do the graft to be a master of the craft
You gotta clean the decks if you want to learn the hex
Perfect your washing motion to get good at making potion
Clean the fridge and then the oven to join the witches' coven
You don't wanna be a doctor, a lawyer, or a dentist
You wanna study magic, be a sorcerer's apprentice
If you wanna be a witch, well, here's the sitch
Put in the hours for magical powers!
Magic Misdirection
[Exhausted, Gumball and Darwin decide to rest for a moment. All of a sudden, a strange energy envelopes them both]
Gumball: Wait... I think I can feel something!
Darwin: You're right! I can feel my magic powers growing!
Gumball: The power, it's happening!
[Their muscles bulging, the two develop at an accelerated rate, turning into bearded giants. Laughing all the while, they begin to cast powerful spells with reckless abandon. Meanwhile, back in reality, Mrs. Jötunheim walks in on the brothers spacing out amid the fumes of several spilled cleaning products]
Mrs. Jötunheim: What the?! What are you doing?! [Magically cleans up the mess] You don't have enough brain cells to afford to fry them like that!
Gumball: Wait, what? We haven't learned any magic?
Mrs. Jötunheim: No.
Darwin: What?! Why?!
Mrs. Jötunheim: Because you, uh... haven't finished cleaning the basement.
Gumball & Darwin: Ohh.
[They run off]
Mrs. Jötunheim: [Calling after them] Just don't open the door of forbidden secrets!
[They quickly return]
Gumball: [Prying] Why?
Mrs. Jötunheim: [Bluffing] Well, 'cause it's, uh... really, really... boring?
Gumball: Hmm. [Glares at her suspiciously; Sneezes] Sorry. There's been a lot of dust today. Okay, we won't touch that door.
[Gumball and Darwin leave again, and head down the basement stairs carrying a mop and bucket. After passing by a large, ominous looking door, they stop, and so does the ambient background music. Both of them walk backwards, and the music reverses as well. After some more back-and-forth, the two approach the door]
Gumball: That boring door looks like the most amazing thing I've ever seen. [Reaches for the skull-shaped ring pull]
Darwin: [Angry] What are you doing?! She clearly doesn't want us to go in!
Gumball: [Picks up a cloth] I'm just... polishing the handle. [Opens the door a crack; Sarcastic] Oh, no! It opened by mistake.
[A dark shadow appears on the other side, accompanied by a loud roar. In an instant, Darwin is pulled through the gap, and the door slams shut. Gumball goes upstairs to Mrs. Jötunheim, who is playing an online game on her crystal ball]
Game Voice: Magical!
Gumball: [Nervous] Soo... I've got a question. Do trolls like, uh, normally eat people?
Mrs. Jötunheim: Normally, trolls bait people to make them angry. They feed on people's anger.
[Gumball sighs in relief]
Mrs. Jötunheim: And then they eat them. [Concerned] Wait, please tell me you didn't feed the troll.
Gumball: I... didn't feed the troll?
[The aforementioned creature crashes through the room and makes for the exit]
Gumball: It fed itself... on Darwin.
Mrs. Jötunheim: [Frantic] This is terrible! A troll on the loose, and a missing child! This could lead to... [Hushed] a witch trial!
Gumball: [Scared] You mean with pitchforks and flaming torches?
Mrs. Jötunheim: No, way worse! With lawyers and court fees! And it's my money that's gonna burn.
Gumball: It's okay, I'll help you using the magic you taught me.
Mrs. Jötunheim: Oh yeah, about that...I wasn't training you, I just tricked you into doing my chores.
Gumball: [Gasps] But how?! [Slyly] Was it some kind of magic mind trick?
Mrs. Jötunheim: Nah, just a regular mind trick.
Gumball: [Disappointed] Oh.
Mrs. Jötunheim: Ah, come on. [Hands him a wizard hat] Put this on, it'll give you magic powers. [He puts it on but all the trash he stuffed into it earlier falls on him]
Troll Baiting
[Elsewhere, in Elmore, Mr. Small is casually crossing a bridge over the flood control channel. A deep voice addresses him from somewhere down below]
Troll: Global warming isn't real!
Mister Small​​: [Leans over the railing; Vehement] I'm sorry, but there are scientific proofs that—
Troll: I think you mean, "There is scientific proof." Don't they teach grammar at yoga academy?
Mister Small​​: For your information, yoga is a very physical and noble activity!
Troll: No need to get so excited, hon.
Mister Small​​: [Face turns red] I am a MAN!
Troll: Hard to tell with that voice and that ponytail. You don't have to get all defensive.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: I'M NOT BEING DEFENS—
[Mr. Small screams when the troll's hand reaches up to grab him. He is immediately freed by a well-aimed magic missile, which leaves an unusual cloud of smoke upon impact. Mrs. Jötunheim and Gumball ride by on brooms]
Gumball: Lite?
Mrs. Jötunheim: You only have the demo versions of my powers. Every spell you cast has a watermark. Now, you take care of the troll while I erase Mr. Small's memory.
[Mrs. Jötunheim lands on the bridge, using her wand to blow a puff of sparkling green mist at Mr. Small. His eyes turn pink as he coughs, laughs, then falls unconscious. She gives a thumbs-up to Gumball, who is running to the opposite railing. The troll crawls out from under the bridge and stands, towering over him]
Gumball: [Casting a spell] Unexpecto amphibiosis!
[It misses, striking an airplane high in the sky and turning it into a frog]
Mrs. Jötunheim: Aah! What are you doing?!
[She reverses the transformation moments before it hits the ground, and the plane resumes its flightpath directly overhead. The troll narrowly avoids the aircraft, then prepares to strike]
Gumball: Disappeariosis!
[The troll vanishes from sight]
Gumball: Ha! Gotcha!
[A growl shakes the area]
Mrs. Jötunheim: Agh! You didn't make him disappear!
[An unseen attack knocks Mrs. Jötunheim and Gumball off of the bridge and into the channel]
Mrs. Jötunheim: You made him invisible!
[Up ahead, the after-effects of the creature's heavy footsteps draw closer]
Gumball: I think I know where he is. Take this! Electriosis!
[He zaps the troll with lightning, dispelling the invisibility, but fails to take into account the shallow stream of water connecting them. The current travels toward Gumball, and Mrs. Jötunheim shoves him aside]
Mrs. Jötunheim: Watch out!
[She gets electrocuted in his place, and falls forward. The troll tries to crush her with its fist]
Gumball: Uh, T-T-Teleportarion!
[His spell sends Mrs. Jötunheim directly above the troll. Thinking that she had escaped, it tilts back its head and roars, accidentally swallowing her whole]
Gumball: [Gasps] Pacificosus absolutus!
[Now under the effect of a love spell, the troll chases Gumball as he runs away screaming. After apprehending him, it begins to kiss him affectionately]
Gumball: Oh, man!
[Gumball summons a block of ice, which shatters against the trolls face and loosens its grip. They both drop to the ground, opposite each other]
Gumball: Ha! Petrificus! [Notices his magic is gone] Oh, oh no! My hat!
Troll: [Collects the hat] Too late, little man! You got beat. [Rips it in half]
Gumball: [Softly] I think you mean "beaten."
Troll: Ha! You think you can troll a troll? You got a lot to learn.
Gumball: I know. I always thought trolls were like those little porcelain guys on the lawn.
Troll: That's gnomes. You know that's gnomes.
Gumball: Oh, right. You guys are the ones with the lucky charms.
Troll: [Irate] No! That's leprechauns! You're talking about lepre— [Regurgitates Mrs. Jötunheim; Shrinks]
Mrs. Jötunheim: [Lands beside Gumball] You found his weakness! Trolls are only as big as we make them. Keep doing it.
Gumball: Keep doing what?
Mrs. Jötunheim: Being yourself.
Gumball: [Shrugs] Okay. So, if you're a troll, why don't you have an Irish accent and live at the end of a rainbow?
Troll: That's totally leprechauns! Stop doing leprechauns! [Spits out Felicity; Gets smaller]
Gumball: Got it. So the orcs are the ones with the big feet that live in the burrows.
Troll: No! The orcs are the—​​​​​​​ [Proceeds to vomit out Gary, Jeff, and lastly Darwin]
Gumball: Oh, no-no-no-no-no, you're right. Orcas are the panda-looking whales.
Darwin: Ugh! Man, it stank in there! He's disgusting.
Gumball: Actually, elves are quite cute when they're small.
Troll: [Continues shrinking; High-pitched voice] I am not an elf! Would you... Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Darwin: I think we found your talent.
Gumball: What is it?
[The troll diminishes entirely]
Mrs. Jötunheim: You're supernaturally annoying.
[Gumball smiles happily; The episode ends]
