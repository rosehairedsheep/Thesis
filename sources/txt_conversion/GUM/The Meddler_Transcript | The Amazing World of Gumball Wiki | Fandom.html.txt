Gumball Needs More Attention
[Scene starts at the Wattersons' living room; Richard is flipping TV channels with the remote]
Richard: [Scoffs] When's someone gonna invent a TV that flicks its own channels?
[Nicole comes home tired and collapses on the sofa]
Richard: Hey honey, how was work? Is dinner ready yet?
[Gumball enters the house]
Gumball: Hey, Mom, Dad, guess what? I got a B plus in home-ec today! Miss Simian said my soufflé was divine. [Blocks the TV screen]
Richard: Yeah, yeah, that's very interesting.
Gumball: [Throws soufflé] I also learned how to do a cartwheel. You guys wanna see? [Attempts a cartwheel]
Richard: Yeah, yeah. I'm very proud of you son. [Frantically tries to watch with Gumball in the way]
Gumball: [Realizes Richard isn't listening] I also crashed your car on the run from the police after I robbed a bank.
Richard: Uh huh, good for you.
[Gumball whistles as he walks, falls over and pretends to injure his leg]
Gumball: Ah! My leg! It's broken! I probably need to get it cut off! Ahaaa! And yet nobody cares. WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET NOTICED IN THIS HOUSE?! [Runs upstairs as Nicole wakes up alarmed and confused]
Nicole: What? Richard, I think Gumball needs some attention. Maybe you should go and play catch-
Richard: Yeah, yeah. We're all very proud of you, Nicole.
[Nicole sighs and walks up the stairs; scene changes to Gumball's bedroom, Nicole appears behind the door, enters the room and sits next to the upset Gumball who proceeds to move away until he falls off the bed]
Gumball: [Upset] What?
Nicole: Listen honey, I'm sorry you've not been getting enough attention lately. I'm going to make it up to you starting tomorrow.
Gumball: [Scoffs] Why not now?! [Sees Nicole asleep and snoring by his bed; he sighs]
Gumball's Difficult Relationships
[The next day at school, the bell rings as Gumball approaches Penny with Darwin behind him]
Gumball: So, uh, Penny, wanna hang out after school? I'll show you my cartwheel.
Darwin: I've seen it... it's not as good as it sounds.
Penny: Sorry, Gumball. It's the cheerleader tryouts tonight, I've been practicing all year for this. Another time though. [Walks away]
Gumball: [Giggling] Okay, no problem. I love you Penny.
Penny: [Walks back] What!?
Gumball: Wha, oh nothing. I just said I love peanuts. [Laughing, then turns to a whisper] Yeah, peanuts... th-they taste so good.
Penny: Gumball, I am a peanut. That's like me saying I like to eat cats. Maybe you should think twice about the things you say.
Gumball: But, I did think twice.
Penny: Well maybe you need to think three times. Anyway, see you later.
Gumball: [Yelling] Wait, I didn't say peanuts, I said ponies! I love ponies! They taste of nuts! [Calms down] Oh, whatever.
Darwin: Maybe you need to talk with your mouth shut.
[The locker suddenly opens, revealing Nicole scrunched inside]
Nicole: Is that really the way you talk to girls?
Gumball: [Screams with Darwin] Mom, what are you doing here?
Nicole: [Gets out of the locker and dusts herself] Well you said you wanted more attention, so I followed you to school. But by the looks of it you need more than attention; you need serious help, little man.
Nicole's Time at Elmore Junior High
[Nicole, Gumball and Darwin are walking along the hall, Darwin has a huge grin on his face]
Gumball: [Embarrassed] Aw Mom, if you're seriously going to follow us around all day, do you really need to hold my hand?
Nicole: Yes.
Darwin: [Through his teeth] Yay! Mom's at school!
Nicole: And it's not all day, it's all week. I took the night shift.
[Gumball groans; Tina, Jamie, Banana Joe and Anton are laughing at Gumball]
Tina: Hey, Mom, need a diaper for that baby?
[They continue to laugh]
Gumball: [High-pitched] Ooh, actually I am fully potty trained, so check your facts all right?
[Tina laughs]
Tina: You know you got 'em good when their voices go high.
Nicole: [Angrily] Gumball! Are you really going to take that?
Darwin: She just owned you.
Gumball: [High-pitched] What? You got a better idea?
Nicole: Well, first of all, drop an octave, then give her a taste of her own medicine. Try this. [Whispers to Gumball]
Gumball: [Steps forward] Uh, Tina? I'd just like to say that maybe you only bully people because you're insecure about your walnut-sized brain and the fact that you smell like a sweaty butcher.
Tina: [High-pitched] I'll have you know that smell is a glandular problem! [Walks away in embarrassment]
Banana Joe: [Laughs] Glandular.
[The kids laugh]
Gumball: Wow, it actually worked!
Jamie: Yeah, that was funny! But good luck when Tina comes back and your mom's not around to hold your hand.
Nicole: Don't worry, Gummypuss! I'll hold your hand until college, if I have to!
Banana Joe: [Laughs] Gummypuss!
Gumball: Aw Mom, stop embarrassing me!
[Runs away and bumps into Principal Brown, who was drinking coffee, and his face gets splashed with hot coffee]
Nigel Brown: Ah, it burns! [Grabs a can of paint and splashes it on his face] My eyes! What was that?!
Gumball: Uh, I don't know!? Paint?
Nigel Brown: [Grabs chlorine and does the same; the hair on his face falls out] AH! My hair! What was that?!
Gumball: Uh, uh chlorine from the pool?
Nigel Brown: [Grabs fertilizer and does the same; his hair grows back] DAAH! What was that?!
Gumball: Uh, fertilizer?
Nigel Brown: Ah, uh. [Regains composure] Oh, I guess it's alright then. But that's still two hours of detention, for potentially damaging my beautiful face!
Nicole: Really, Principal Brown. You need to be firmer than that!
Gumball: Huh?
Nigel Brown: Oh okay. Four hours detention!
[Nicole signals Principal Brown to increase the detention time]
Nigel Brown: Eight hours?
[Nicole approves with a thumbs up and a wink]
Nigel Brown: Hm, good. See you in detention, Watterson.
Gumball: [Upset] Mom, you're not helping.
[Scene changes to the classroom where the Eggheads write a note, which is passed on by students; it eventually reaches Nicole]
Nicole: [Laughing] The nerds think you look like a dodeca-dork with your mom at school.
Darwin: [Laughing] What does that mean?
Nicole: It's a twelve-sided dork, honey.
[Darwin laughs awkwardly]
Gumball: Mom, you're not helping.
[Scene changes to the boys' locker room where everyone stands in line, watching Nicole bathe Gumball]
Gumball: Mom! You're not helping!
[Scene changes to the cafeteria where everyone watches Nicole as she feeds Gumball]
Nicole: Who-Whooo! [Makes train noise] Come on honey, open the tunnel for the choo-choo train. Whoo-Whoooo-
Gumball: Mom, you're not helpi-
[Nicole shovels the food in his mouth; Gumball pushes her away]
Gumball:  Enough! The Tina thing was kind of helpful, but this has gone too far. [Air goes up his esophagus] Wait a minute, I've-
[Nicole pats Gumball on the back and he burps]
Gumball: Thanks. Now seriously, I need you to stop meddling with my life!
Nicole: I'm not meddling, I'm helping.
Gumball: Helping by meddling! You're just a big meddler.
Nicole: I'm not a meddler, I'm your mother.
Darwin: And a meddler.
[Penny can be heard laughing off-screen]
Nicole: Hey, isn't that the girl you like?
Gumball: Mom no!
Nicole: [Walks over to Penny] Excuse me Penny, have you got a second?
Penny: Sure, but you guys will need to be quick. The cheerleader tryouts are about to start.
Gumball: Mom... if you love me, please don't do this.
Nicole: Oh come on Gummypuss, don't be shy. My baby has something to say to you.
Gumball: [Laughs nervously] No, I don't.
Nicole: He'd like to take you out on a date.
Gumball: That's not true.
Nicole: [Whispers] He loves you.
Penny: [Ecstatic] Really?
Gumball: NO I DON'T. I DON'T LOVE PENNY AND I NEVER WILL!
[Penny drops her food tray in shock]
Nicole: Gumball!
Penny: [Sad] Well, thanks for being honest with me. [Walks away]
Gumball: No, wait! I meant I'll never love peanut- NO! PONIES! UH- [Crying] See what you did? You upset Penny! How am I suppose to get her back?!
Nicole: Well, you know I could help you with that.
Gumball: That's enough! Okay?! That's enough! I'm my own man now! I make my own decisions, and I don't need you babying me anymor- [Air goes up Gumball's esophagus again] anymor-
[Nicole pats Gumball's back again and he burps]
Gumball: Thanks. Now just go home okay?
Nicole: Oh come on, we all had a great time! Didn't we Darwin?
Darwin: [Still grinning] To be honest, I've never been so embarrassed in my entire life!
Nicole: Why are you smiling then?
Darwin: Well at first I was trying not to hurt your feelings, but now I'm just stuck!
Gumball: I beg of you, just get out of my life.
Nicole: [Sadly] Okay, I guess I'll just go home then.
[Scene changes to the outside of the school where Nicole sadly walks to her car. Suddenly her phone starts ringing and she picks up]
Gumball: MOM! YOU'VE GOTTA COME BACK! I MADE MY OWN DECISION! IT WAS A BAD ONE! A REALLY, REALLY, BAD ONE!
[Nicole starts running back into the school]
Bad Decisions
[Scene changes to the school hall where Darwin is massaging his face]
Darwin: Oh, thank goodness she's gone! I'll never smile again!
Nicole: Darwin!
[Darwin sees her and starts grinning again]
Darwin: Mom, you're back! Yay.
Nicole: Do you know where your brother is?
Darwin: [Points at the direction behind him] In the changing room!
Nicole: Thanks! [Starts running to the changing room]
[Darwin continues to grin in pain and tears started coming out of his eyes. Scene changes to outside the changing room where Nicole bangs at the door]
Nicole: Gumball? It's me. Open the door.
Gumball: [Screaming] NO! NO I WON'T!
Nicole: What happened?
Gumball: Oh it's awful! I made a decision on my own and it was bad! [Crying]
Nicole: Listen, whatever it is you've done, you need to come out and face it.
Gumball: Alright.. [Sobbing] Alright.. I'm coming out.
[Door opened and shows Gumball sadly walking out of the changing room in a cheerleader dress and carrying pom-poms]
Nicole: Oh, you were gonna try and get closer to Penny by joining her cheer team, but now you feel embarrassed because you have to wear a skirt.
Gumball: What? No! I'm gonna beat Penny at her own game so she'll realize how awesome and manly I am! Then she'll definitely wanna date me!
Nicole: Right. So, what's the problem?
Gumball: The problem is me! What if I'm not good as the other girls? What if they laugh at me? And this leotard makes me look fat, so I put this skirt on to hide my butt. [Lift up his skirt to show his butt]
Nicole: What exactly do you want me to do, honey?
Gumball: Err, hello? Be there of course? I need emotional support? You're my mom? Start acting like it?
Nicole: [Takes a deep breath] Okay lets go.
Cheerleader Audition
[Scene changes to the school gym where the cheerleader audition is held. Penny is performing in front of Mr. Small and Principal Brown, who are the judges. They monitored her performs. Penny then balanced herself to end her performance, then shows a sad face after the judges disapproved her performance]
Nigel Brown: [Makes tisk-tisk sounds] Now, Penny, I have to say I'm a little disappointed.
Penny: I know, it's just I had some emotional problems this afternoon-
Mister Small​​​​: [Shouting] YOU LEAVE YOUR EMOTIONS AT THE DOOR! THIS IS CHEER LEADING, NOT DRAMA CLUB! YOU BETTER SHAPE UP OR SHIP OUT! 'CAUSE THIS IS THE BIG LEAGUE, SISTER! AND RIGHT NOW YOU'RE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL! [Calms down] Is there anything you'd like to add, Principal Brown?
Nigel Brown: Only that we're making cuts today, and after that performance someone's gonna have to be pretty bad enough for it to be you.
[Gumball slams open the gym door]
Gumball: Am I too late?
[The girls at the chairs start staring at him while Gumball fiercely walk towards the judges. Gumball then points to Nicole using his pom-poms and Nicole plays the music on Juke. Gumball then begins to perform. He then accidentally kicks his shoe onto Carmen. Nicole then facepalmed herself. Gumball continues to perform while his skirt starts to fall off. He then picks it up. He then starts to do The Cartwheel, but fails. He then poses again. Mr. Small then shows a drawing of a big question mark to Principal Brown. Principal Brown then shows a gesture that he's not sure what's going on. Gumball then starts jumping around, but eventually sprains his ankle]
Gumball: [In slow-motion] Ow!
[Gumball then looked around and then looked at Nicole, mentally asking for support]
Gumball: [Whispers] Mom!
[Nicole gives him a thumbs up. Gumball regains his confidence and the music gets louder. Gumball performs again. This time, he made a successful Cartwheel. However, the judges and the girls are disgusted as his skirt starts to show off his butt. Nicole starts to get shocked. Gumball then ends his performance with a split. The judges stare at him]
Nigel Brown: Well, it's a no for me, Mr. Small.
Mister Small​​​​: It's a no for me too.
Nigel Brown: That's two nos, Gumball. You're going home.
Gumball: [Stares at the judges for a second] [Crying] NOOOO! MOM! MAKE THEM RECOUNT THE SCORE! MAKE THEM RECOUNT THE SCORE!
[Gumball then reaches out to Nicole and Nicole picks him up]
Nicole: Well, [Starts putting Gumball's legs around her] Zero plus zero equals zero, honey!
Gumball: [Crying] Why is the world. SO. CRUEL?!
Nicole: Don't worry, you'll do better next time! After a couple of years intense training.
Penny: [Runs up to Gumball] Oh Gumball, thank you! It was so brave of you to sacrifice your dignity so I can get on the team! I guess that means- [Starts twisting her foot] -you do like me. Just a little?
Gumball: [Crying] Peanuts... ponies...
Nicole: I think that means yes.
[Penny smiles as Nicole carries Gumball out of the gym]
Gumball: Mom, you know when I said I wanted, to be my own man and, make my own decisions?
Nicole: Yes?
[Scene changes to the school hall where Darwin massages his face again. When Nicole and Gumball show up once more, he starts grinning again]
Gumball: Can it just wait for a few years?
Nicole: The longer the better, honey! Even when you're eighty you'll still be my Gummypuss!
[Camera then zooms to Darwin's grinning face. After awhile, his head explodes]
