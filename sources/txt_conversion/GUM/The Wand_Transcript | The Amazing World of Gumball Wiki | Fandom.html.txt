Richard: [Sadly] I never believed in anything again. But I believe this will be different. Now, I've got some wishing to do! Hehe, hehe, hehe!
[Richard runs off scene]
Gumball: You know what this means, Darwin. We'll have to make sure all of Dad's wishes come true.
Darwin: Why?
Gumball: Because if we don't, he'll never be able to believe in anything again. And he might go crazy and start screaming. We'll have to make sure he thinks that wand is real!
Darwin: Yeah!
Making the Wand "Real"
[Scene changes to the living room where Richard is sitting on the couch and Gumball and Darwin are hiding behind the couch]
Richard: Uh... Ooh, I wish for sausages to fly into my mouth.
[Closes his eyes and opens his mouth. Gumball and Darwin look at each other, then hide behind the couch again. A sausage tied to a string flies into Richard's mouth]
Richard: [Excited] I think you and me are gonna be friends.
[Richard hears sounds]
Richard: Huh?
[He notices the sound came from the sink's leaky faucet. Richard groans, but realizes he can "use" the wand.]
Richard: I wish the sink was fixed!
Gumball: Well, how do you fix a sink?
Darwin: I don't know.
[Gumball and Darwin pull on the sink's drainage pipes and dirty water spills. Gumball and Darwin scream]
Darwin: Quick, Mr. Dad is going to find out the wand is not real!
[Gumball drinks all the dirty water]
[Richard is pleased by this. Meanwhile, Darwin pokes Gumball, letting all of the dirty water get out. Darwin is covered in dirty water]
Richard: You are truly powerful! I shall name you Wanda the Wonderful Wand of Wonder!
Gumball: Quick! I think Dad is about to make another wish.
[Scene transitions to the front yard]
Richard: [Waving wand] I wish it was raining pancakes!
[Pancakes start falling from the house. Richard walks in circles happily. Meanwhile, Darwin is picking up pancakes for Gumball to throw from the attic]
Richard: I wish... [Waving wand] I wish it was Christmas every day!
[A bag falls from the chimney, containing Gumball in it. Darwin falls onto the bag while wearing a Santa costume. Gumball comes out of the bag]
Darwin: Ho ho ho!
Gumball and Darwin: Merry Christmas everyone!
[Darwin and Gumball skip away while Richard laughs and receives a present]
Richard: [Waving the wand] I wish... [Gloomy] I wish I was taller.
[Gumball and Darwin are sawing off the chairs and the tables. Richard is skipping, and is amused that he "became taller"]
Richard: Now I'm a giant!
[Richard is sitting on the couch, waving the wand]
Richard: I wish... I wish I had... A monster truck.
[A monster truck drives in]
Richard: Yeah, a monster truck T-Shirt!
[Darwin pats the monster truck, and Gumball drives in reverse. A T-Shirt is thrown from off-screen to Richard. He waves the wand once more]
Richard: I wish... I wish I could be invisible!
Gumball: [Covers mouth and talks quietly] Come on Darwin, just do what I do. [Pretends he can't see Richard] Where's Dad? I wonder where he's gone. [Pointing] Look, he left his wand floating in mid-air.
Darwin: He's here.
Gumball: Come on, Darwin. Let's go and find him.
Darwin: But he's here!
Gumball: [Grabs Darwin and takes him off-screen] Darwin!
In the Backyard
Richard: I wish, I wish it wasn't so hot.
[Gumball and Darwin pull off Richard's clothes. He becomes relaxed]
Gaylord: [Groans] Not again. [Covers Margaret's eyes] Mr. Watterson! Would you kindly refrain from offending my wife's eyeballs with your public display of vulgarity?
Richard: Oh. Sorry, Mr. Robinson. [Suddenly realizes he has the wand] Hey, wait a second. You picked the wrong day to mess with the bunny warlock!
Gaylord: Sorry, what?
Richard: If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you've got! But I think I should warn you, I have supernatural powers!
Gaylord: The only thing supernatural about you is your ignorance.
[He and Margaret laugh]
Richard: I wouldn't be laughing if I was facing the mighty bunny warlock!
Gaylord: The only thing mighty about you is your ignorance.
[He and Margaret laugh]
Gaylord: I used the same joke again.
Richard: Perhaps you haven't noticed, my magic wand, and, my cape!
Gaylord: You don't have a cape.
Richard: Mm? I wish for a cape!
[Gumball and Darwin took the dining table cloth, and quickly put it on Richard, like a cape]
Gaylord: You look ridiculous.
Richard: You leave me no choice, sir! [Waves wand] I wish... I wish...
Gumball: [To Darwin] Here we go!
Richard: I wish you looked ridiculous!
[Gumball and Darwin move around Gaylord like a cyclone so he can't see them, and change his clothes in a blur, to a bikini]
Richard: Aah! Horrible! Take it off, take it off!
[Gumball and Darwin, once again, move in a blur and take off Mr. Robinson's bikini, leaving him naked]
Gaylord: Cover your eyes, woman!
[Margaret does so]
Richard: Ah! No! Put it back on! Put it back on!
[Gumball and Darwin move in a blur and put the bikini back on Mr. Robinson]
Richard: And I wish your wife's head was a melon!
[Gumball and Darwin almost instantly throw a watermelon on Margaret's head, causing her to muffle, her head stuck inside the watermelon]
Richard: Now I wish you would fly away out of my sight!
Gaylord and Margaret: Aah!
[Gumball and Darwin tie ropes around each Robinson's leg and hoist them up]
Richard: You dare to doubt the all-powerful bunny warlock!
Gumball: [Still pulling the rope with Darwin] I can't hold it any longer!
Richard: Now, begone!
[Gumball and Darwin drop Mr. and Mrs. Robinson]
[Richard skips away happily]
Gaylord: He really is a wizard! Run, Margaret, run! [Screams and runs away with Margaret]
[Richard skips while he laughs]
Darwin: Mr. Dad's turning evil!
Gumball: Maybe it's time we told him the truth.
Darwin: But if we tell him the truth, he's gonna get upset, like when he was a boy.
Gumball: Ahh, you're right. [Thinks for a second] I know! We're gonna have to take the wand back!
[Darwin smiles]
Getting the Wand
[In the front yard]
Richard: [Laughing] Is there nothing you can't do, Wanda? I think I finally understand your true power! I wish, I wish, I wi--
Gumball: This has gone on long enough!
Darwin: [Agrees with Gumball] Hmph!
Richard: What are you doing here?
Gumball: That wand - It has made you evil! We're taking it back!
Darwin: [Agrees with Gumball] Hmph!
Richard: You think you mere mortals have the power to challenge me? Come! Take the wand - If you dare!
[Gumball and Darwin rushes toward Richard]
Richard: Slip-over spell!
Gumball: We've got to do it! It'll break his heart if he finds out!
[Gumball and Darwin slips and falls into the mud intentionally. Richard laughs]
Gumball: Can't you see what you've become?
Richard: I can see perfectly clearly! I have become a master wizard!
[Richard screams to the neighborhood. Pantsbully merely gives half a glance, then walks away]
[Gumball and Darwin continues rushing]
Richard: Slow-motion spell!!
Gumball: [In slow-motion] IIttss ppoowweerr hhaass oovveerrttaakkeenn yyoouu!
Richard: Reverse spell!
Gumball: [While doing a reverse-running motion] You overtaken has power its!
Darwin: [While doing the same thing as Gumball] No, it's more like: Uoy nekatrevo sah rewop sti!
Richard: [Giggles] Love spell!
[Romantic music plays, as Gumball and Darwin nervously laugh and awkwardly hug each other]
Richard: Inside-out spell!
[Gumball and Darwin each grab their insides, then pull, causing their inside to come out and cover themselves]
Richard: Ah! Gross! Back-to-normal spell!
[Gumball and Darwin each grab their outsides, which is now inside, and pull, somehow returning to normal again. Richard laughs]
Gumball: Give us the wand!
Richard: Never! I wish your face was his butt and his butt was your face!
Gumball: Really?
Richard: I wished it, didn't I?
[Gumball sighs, then he and Darwin do what Richard wished in a quick blur. Richard laughs]
Richard: Now I wish that your butt was his face and his face was your butt!
[Gumball and Darwin do what Richard wished, once again in a quick blur. Richard laughs again]
Richard: I wish that, umm, your face was kissing his butt and his butt was kissing your face!
[Gumball and Darwin do what Richard wished. He laughs loudly]
Gumball: This has got to stop.
Richard: Ha-ha! Ha ha ha ha-ha!
Gumball: Dad! [He and Darwin are back to normal] We've got something to tell you.
Richard: What's going on? Why have you stopped?
Gumball: That wand's a fake. It's just a plastic toy, from the cereal package.
Richard: [Laughs] What nonsense! If that is true, how do you explain this? Flying spell!
[He jumps, but then instantly drops to the ground. He then slaps the wand]
Gumball: It was us... We have been making it happen right from the start. I hope you're not mad at us.
Richard: You mean... you two kids spent the whole day making incredible wishes come true? You did all that for me?
Gumball and Darwin: Of course!
Richard: Even when I made your butt kiss his face and his face kiss your butt, you did that for me?
Gumball and Darwin: Mmm-hmm!
Richard: Oooh, come here and give me a big hug!
[They all share a long hug]
Richard: But hang on! If you were making my wishes come true, doesn't that mean Wanda the Wonderful Wand of Wonder is a fraud?
Gumball and Darwin: Uh... yeah.
Richard: A fraud?
Gumball and Darwin: Uhh...
Richard: [Tosses the wand away and takes a deep breath] YAA-AAA-AAA-AAA...
The Power Is all Mine!
Gaylord: [Laughs, picking up the wand] It's mine! The power is all mine! [Points wand at his wife] I wish you didn't have that ridiculous haircut!
[Margaret growls]
Gaylord: ... I wish I hadn't said that.
