Late for School
[The episode begins with Darwin preparing for school. He draws on his face, "puts on" his legs, and draws a watch on his wrist. Looking at the time, he is alarmed and runs off to Gumball]
Darwin: Wake up! We're gonna be late for school!
Gumball: [Still sleeping] Ugh. I'll get up when the alarm goes off.
Darwin: But you've already pressed the snooze button!
Gumball: That was five minutes ago.
Darwin: That was an hour ago! Snooze time goes faster than regular time.
Gumball: I just found the perfect position.
[Darwin pulls the blanket away from Gumball, uncovering his twisted body]
Darwin: Dude, you look like you fell from the seventh floor.
Gumball: Come on, man. Just another minute.
Darwin: No! We're already late. Look!
[Darwin carries Gumball to the window, where they see the school bus leave. They both scream, and Gumball becomes wide-awake]
Gumball: Alright! What we need is a good excuse. We need something embarrassing that Miss Simian totally wouldn't want to know about like "sorry, Miss. It's because Darwin made a bad taco, and, well…" [Acts like he has a bad stomach, then acts like he is puking]
Darwin: First of all, don't diss Mexican food, because it rocks. Secondly, that looked like "Darwin ate a taco, played a sad song on a keytar, his head exploded, and then he fired lasers out of his fingers."
Gumball: That would be a good excuse, though.
Darwin: No. Don't you remember what Simian said?
[Flashback. Back at class, Miss Simian talks to the two]
Lucy Simian: …and if you turn up late again, I will have no choice but to… [Becomes muffled]
Gumball (present): No. All I remember is that I never noticed before how the top of her head looks like Mount Fuji.
[The flashback ends]
Darwin: She said [Acts like Miss Simian] "If you turn up late again, I'll have no choice but to expel you both!"
Gumball: EXPEL?!
[Gumball transforms into his outdoor clothes, Wonder Woman-style]
Gumball: Right. How long have we got?
[An omnipresent counter appears above them, starting a countdown to zero from six minutes and two seconds. Gumball and Darwin are surprised by the timer]
Gumball: Uh…okay. Thanks?
[They walk away, out of their bedroom. Outside though, they find the counter again and scream]
Gumball: This is really weird. I think we should try and figure out what's causing it.
Darwin: Well, I think we should run before we get expelled.
Gumball: Let's compromise.
Racing Against Time
[The scene shifts to them running across Elmore town, all the while keeping their eyes on the timer. The timer is unaffected by the transition of the scene. By now, Gumball has zipped and buttoned up his outdoor pants and has fastened up his outdoor belt]
Darwin: I can't keep going like this forever. We've been running for hours!
Gumball: Ugh, you've gotta be kidding. We've been running for five seconds.
Darwin: Eh, it just feels longer when you look at the clock.
Gumball: Okay, okay. Stop. We're not gonna make it on time.
[They stop at a bus stop]
Gumball: I really don't want to say this, but there's only one solution left: we're gonna have to get... the public bus.
[The scene zooms in on Darwin's face, with suspenseful, comically long, dramatic music playing]
Darwin: Wait. What's so bad about the public bus?
Gumball: It's a zoo in there.
[Darwin gasps in delight]
Gumball: Not literally.
Darwin: Aww.
Gumball: It is filled with filthy carnivores, dangerous scavengers, and poisonous reptiles– basically people who don't own a car.
Darwin: So, what do we do?
Gumball: Anybody who looks at you sideways, you just drop 'em. Like this.
[Gumball demonstrates by hitting an attached panel on the bus stop sign. The panel spins around, and knocks Gumball on the head]
Gumball: Yeah. Well, you get the idea.
[The bus arrives. A cautious Darwin looks at the Manly Warrior (the driver of the bus) and sees him looking sideways]
Darwin: [Discreetly] He's looking at me sideways. [Raises fin to strike] AH–
[Gumball quickly grabs Darwin's fin, spins him around, and stops his brother, laughing anxiously]
Gumball: Dude, he has to. He's supposed to look at the road. The other ones, you have to worry about.
[He indicates the passengers. Gumball and Darwin nod at each other, and while walking to find a seat, they try to intimidate the indifferent passengers. As Gumball passes by, Gary coughs]
Gumball: WHAT!?
Gary: [Cups a hand to an ear] What?
Gumball: What?
Gary: What?
Gumball: No. What, as in like whaaa?
Gary: What?
Alison: Sh!
Gumball: What!?
[Gumball sees Alison Sandra Gator with a bottle of juice]
Gumball: Oh, uh–
[Gumball grabs the bottle and drinks its contents. In reaction to the juice, he shivers and almost gags]
Gumball: [Disgusted] What is this?
Alison: Clam juice and tomato.
[Gumball refills the bottle with the juice he consumed and gives it back to the old citizen. He and Darwin continue looking for a seat, with Gumball making an "I'm keeping an eye on you" motion to Alison. At the back of the bus, a baby apple accidentally hits Gumball with his rattle. This scares Gumball and makes him pull out all his money and take off his shirt]
Gumball: AH! Please take everything. Please, I beg you! Just [Raises hands] just don't hit the face…
[The baby apple laughs, and Gumball sees all the passengers staring at him]
Gumball: I'm sorry, everyone. Sorry. My brother had some very suburban preconceptions about what the city bus was like, and he behaved like a complete dipstick.
[Darwin hits Gumball]
Gumball: Ow! Uh, so yeah. Can someone please tell us how long it will take to get to Elmore High?
Alison: This bus is going to Richwood.
Gumball and Darwin: WHAT!?
Darwin: We're running out of time!
Gumball: We're gonna have to jump off the bus. In three, two–
[The bus doors open]
Gumball: Whohohohohokay. So how bad would it really be if we got expelled from school?
Darwin: Well, we will probably never get a job, slowly drift away from society, live in the sewers, eat toxic waste, mutate and end up in a freak show with fingers instead of teeth.
Gumball: Can someone push us off the bus, please?
Alison: With pleasure.
Darwin: Wait!
[He pushes a button which makes the bus stop]
Darwin: See? Not everything has to end in some mad stunt.
Gumball: Okay. [To Alison] Now, you can push us off.
Alison: With pleasure.
[Gumball and Darwin are pushed off the side of a bridge, slowly and painfully fall down the side of a cliff, and land at the back of a pickup truck. They end up in a pile of junk in the desert. Gumball sardonically and slowly claps for Darwin]
Darwin: Dude, that was your idea.
Gumball: [Pinches Darwin] You don't have time for the blame game.
Darwin: You're right! We've only got three minutes to make it to school!
Gumball: Thinking about it, how did we get so far in the desert in only four seconds?
[The counter adjusts itself, and leaves them with only two minutes]
Gumball: [To Darwin] You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you? You just had to mention it!
Darwin: You mentioned it!
[Gumball pinches Darwin]
Darwin: Ah! Sorry. I know. Blame game.
Gumball: To be honest, one minute doesn't really make any sense either. I mean it would take at least a few hours–
Darwin: [Pinches Gumball and then smiles while discreetly saying:] Yes. If it only takes four minutes to get here, then it only takes one minute to get back to town.
Gumball: …Hm.
A Minute Left
[They get down, and arrive back in Elmore with only a minute to spare]
Gumball and Darwin: Yay! We still have one minute left to get to school!
Gumball: Wait, one minute doesn't help.
Darwin: What do we do!?
Gumball: We use the fastest way to get from one point to another.
[The scene shows Darwin running, while Gumball tries to do some parkour]
Darwin: What are you doing?
Gumball: Parkour! It's the fastest way to get from A to B.
[They continue on their journey, and Gumball struggles to do more parkour moves. He comes across Miss Simian in her car]
Lucy Simian: What the–
[Gumball hits her car]
Lucy Simian: Hey! Why aren't you two at school?
[Gumball then slides through the hood and runs off]
Lucy Simian: Ha. You're gonna be late. I've got you this time!
[Miss Simian starts her car and drives. She catches up with them easily]
Darwin: Gumball, come on!
Lucy Simian: [Laughs] You're done for! [Drives away]
Gumball: Faster!
[Gumball and Darwin quicken their pace. With Mr. Small in their way, Darwin avoids him just in time, but Gumball does not. He hits him, and flies towards the screen, breaking it and stopping the timer at only seven seconds]
Frozen in Time
Darwin: Gumball!
[Darwin sees Mr. Small suspended in the air, mid-fall, and other inhabitants of the town (the pigeons, Harold, Martin) all frozen. All of Elmore, the world, and the whole universe are frozen in time]
Darwin: Um… what just happened?
Gumball: Dude. I think we just broke time!
[They snicker, and laugh]
Gumball and Darwin: We never have to worry about time again!
[They start dancing. Gumball passes by Martin, plops Martin's ice cream on his head, and puts his dog in place of his ice cream. Gumball comes across Sal Left Thumb carrying the Hexagon Lady's bag, with Gary watching in surprise. Gumball makes it so that Gary looks like he beat up Sal Left Thumb, and Hexagon Lady looks lovestruck]
Darwin: Dude, we're superheroes!
[Gumball puts lipstick on Gary]
Darwin: Right. I guess we're still above average.
[Gumball pulls down Gary's pants]
Darwin: I guess we're more like okay.
[They laugh, and hop off. The scene switches to them trying to throw candy into Pantsbully's open mouth]
Darwin: Come on, dude.
Gumball: Alright, one last time.
[Gumball throws one last candy ball which bounces around Pantsbully's mouth. It shoots right in. As Gumball and Darwin cheer, a tooth comes out]
Darwin: We can't leave him like that.
Gumball: Let me just…
[Gumball grabs the tooth and tries to replace it. He ends up pushing the tooth far too deep into the gums]
Gumball: Uh, hold on. I'll just try to dislodge it.
[Gumball slaps Pantsbully's back repeatedly, until he falls. His mouth gets stuck on a fire hydrant]
Gumball: Oh. Hold on.
[He pulls Pantsbully's arm, but accidentally pulls it off]
Darwin: Maybe it's best just to leave him at that, and apologize.
[Gumball puts the arm back and leaves a note with "sorry" on it. They leave and go to Ripley 2000]
Darwin: Wait, dude. It's my turn!
Gumball: What're you gonna do?
[Darwin sticks his nose on the finger of a sign and laughs]
Gumball: Darwin, that sign's always frozen. You could do that anytime.
Darwin: Oh yeah? Well, what would you suggest?
Gumball: How about we go read Captain Punch without getting thrown out of the store?
[They dance their way in, and Gumball takes a comic. He opens it immediately, causing it to burst into flames. He and Darwin scream, and he throws it down the floor]
Gumball: What the what happened!?
Darwin: Dude, we're frozen in time. Think how fast you just turned that page.
Gumball: Right. You know what's not flammable?
Darwin: Yup. Rocks, water, air, teeth, aluminum, dirt–
Gumball: I was sort of hoping you would say "no, what?" so I could say "video games!"
Darwin: Oh, sorry. No, what?
[Gumball inhales to speak]
Darwin: Video games!
Gumball: Forget it!
[Gumball tries to turn on a computer monitor]
Darwin: I think we're actually faster than electricity.
Gumball: What does that mean?
Darwin: It means no TV, no video games, no internet!
Gumball: We have to start that clock again!
Darwin: Wait! That only gives us seven seconds to get back to class!
Gumball: [Sighs] I thought I'd never say this, but we have to get back to school!
Time Traveling
[They arrive at Elmore Junior High, and enter their classroom]
Gumball: Okay. We just have to set the clock back to zero, and everything will be fine. Spin it!
[Darwin starts the timer but accidentally spins it too far. They arrive somewhere in the far future, amongst a pile of wreckage with an expanded sun]
Gumball: Uh, dude, I think you spun it too far.
[The sun explodes]
Gumball: Uh, let's go back a little.
[Gumball spins the timer back in time but inadvertently sends them to the big bang. While holding their breath, Gumball is nodded at by Darwin to spin the timer again. In prehistoric Earth, an ape climbs up a high point of a cliff and strives to stand up on only two legs. As it is cheered on by other apes, Gumball and Darwin appear at the tip of the point, knocking down the ape and scaring it away]
Gumball: What's his problem?
Darwin: Spin it again.
[They travel to the present]
Gumball: Aaand stop!
[He stops the timer on zero as the school bell rings]
Darwin: Oh. We're early!
[Their classmates walk in on all fours]
Anton: So, did you do your homework?
Tobias: Nah. I can't be bothered writing with my mouth.
[Gumball and Darwin are shocked]
Gumball and Darwin: The monkey.
[Darwin brings them back to the monkey, just before it stands upright. They hide behind the cliff point]
Gumball: Okay. We're about to appear. We have to stop ourselves from pushing that monkey.
[They rush to the tip, and push away duplicates of themselves off the cliff just as they appear]
Gumball: Ah! We didn't think this through! If our past selves get iced, it means our now selves will never exist!
Darwin: What does that mean?
Gumball: It means we'll disappear into nothingness.
[The duplicates fly back up, and land near the original duo]
Gumball: Uh, how did that happen?
[A third pair of duplicates emerges from the cliff point's side]
Gumball 3: We just put a trampoline at the bottom of the cliff.
Gumball: Aw. Why didn't I think of that?
[A fourth pair emerges]
Darwin 4: But you did.
Gumball 4: Just not the first time.
[Another pair appears with wounds]
Gumball 5: [Hurt] Yeah. First we built a mattress with whatever was around.
Gumball 4: What's wrong with that?
Gumball 5: There's only rocks around here.
[A sixth pair appears with food and drinks]
Gumball 5: What're you guys doing here?
Gumball 6: We're here to watch the fight.
Gumball 4: What fight?
Gumball 6: The one about who gets to go back to the present.
[All but the sixth duo blink and start fighting. The latter duo laughs, and goes back to the present. However, they find that their classmates have become evolved versions of themselves. Gumball brings them back to the past]
Gumball: Hey, stop it! None of you should be here anyway. It's a time paradox.
All other Gumball and Darwins: Oh yeah.
[They simultaneously disappear. The watching apes start to worship the remaining pair]
Gumball: Why do I have a feeling this is gonna be bad news?
[He brings them to an alternate timeline where they are at the top of a temple, being worshiped. A crowd gasps]
Sarah: The saviors have returned!
Tobias​​​​​​​: The prophecy was true!
[The crowd cheers]
Gumball: What do you know? We're deities.
[They bask in the crowd's praises]
Sarah: Thank you!
Tobias​​​​​​​: Thank you!
Girl: Thank you so much!
Gumball: Uh… thank you for what?
Lucy Simian: [Emerges] For your sacrifice!
[Gumball and Darwin frantically spin the timer. They later appear in another alternate timeline where everyone is obese. Among their several attempts to fix the past, they come across timelines where their classmates speak German]
Sarah: Ich mag in die Disco gehen! [Translation: I like to go to the Disco!]
Tobias​: Keine Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung auf der Autobahn! [Translation: No speed limit on the highway!]
[Gumball and Darwin then go into a timeline where everyone has two heads, where everyone is large, upside down, and where they have tongues with mouths and no pupils. They finally arrive at a seemingly normal timeline]
Gumball: Hm. This looks suspiciously normal.
[They blink vertically]
Gumball: I can live with that.
[The episode ends]
