I'm Singing
[The song starts during the titlecard; the episode starts with Nicole and Richard sleeping. Meanwhile, a showerhead is singing in the background]
Showerhead: [Singing] The day might be gray
But you can chase all your troubles away
When you're singing!
Nicole: Huh?
Showerhead: So things may seem blue,
But what does that matter to you
When you're singing!
[Nicole opens the curtain to find the showerhead]
[Spoken] Hey, don't you ever knock?
Nicole: You're too loud, keep it down,
Or you'll wake everybody in town
With your singing!
Showerhead: Aww!
[Chuckles]
[Singing] You look rough and half dead
Did you get out the wrong side of bed?
Let's keep singing—
[Nicole rips the showerhead away and throws it into a trash can]
Showerhead: Aah!
[Nicole goes to the car]
I've been ripped from the wall
But it feels like no trouble at all
'Cause I'm singing!
[Scene cuts to the doorway of the Robinsons' house]
Gaylord: My wife hates my guts
And my neighbors are driving me nuts
But I'm singing— oof!
[Mrs. Robinson hits him with his briefcase; Gary enters on his bike, hitting him again with a newspaper]
Gary: I'm tired, underpaid
My hair prematurely grayed
But I'm singing!
Hobo: A bird stole my shoes
I thought I had nothing to lose
Still I'm singing! Hey!
[Sal Left Thumb steals his money, then bumps into the Doughnut Sheriff]
Larry: My fifth all-night shift
My mind is startling to bamboo
But I'm singing!
[Mrs. Jötunheim flies across the screen; the scene cuts to her]
Mrs. Jötunheim: My face looks a state
Though I've only just turned twenty-eight
Still I'm singing!
[She summons Hector to go to Elmore Junior High]
Hector: My head's up in space
I've got aeroplanes stuck in my face
But I'm singing!
[Scene cuts to Miss Simian in the middle of class, while the students are causing chaos]
Lucy Simian: These kids are all brats
And the school is infested with rats
Still I'm singing!
[A rat falls into her cup]
Lucy Simian: Hmm?
[The rat pops up]
Lucy Simian: Aah!
Rat: My life's on the skids
Got a hundred and seventy kids
Still I'm singing!
[Miss Simian pours the rat along with the beverage into a trash can; the trash can falls. Billy Parham enters]
Billy: [Spoken] I say, old horse, it's really rather not on to make such a mess. 'Tis high time somebody taught you ruffians some manners, although I fear I must address you hoodlums in a matter you'll understand. I believe it is known in common parlance as rap music.
Billy Parham in Your House
[Rap music plays]
Billy: [Rapping] Billy Parham in your house
Turn me up but not too loud
For fear of disturbing someone
Enunciating to the masses, mm-hmm.
I'm here to tell you of the relevance of etiquette
'Tis quite important, though I fear you might not get it yet
Feet on the seats
I'm sure I don't approve
Hold the door for the ladies
When they go through
Wipe your feet
When you're entering a neighbor's house
And when he chews,
A gentleman will always close his mouth
Close his mouth, close his mouth
The speed a virus spreads is beyond belief
When you sneeze, please be sure to use a handkerchief
Handkerchief
A handkerchief, a handkerchief, a handkerchief, a handkerchief, a handkerchief, a handkerchief...
[While saying the preceding line, he performs the enigmatically popular dance move known as "dabbing."]
Spray-Paint Bottle: Sad when a kid lets himself go like that, am I right?
Billy: A handkerchief...
8-Bit Dog: Dude, I'm just a background character. I'm not supposed to say anything. I don't even have a name.
Spray-Paint Bottle: But everyone has a song, even unimportant background characters.
8-Bit Dog: Maybe I do. You see... [Singing] If I told you my l—
[Teri enters; the 8-bit dog gets cut off]
Teri: Eww, gross! Oh, someone should clean this up.
[A rat appears and hisses at Teri, causing Teri to faint. J-pop music then begins to play as Teri begins dreaming]
Filth, Filth, All Around
Teri: Filth, filth, all around
In the air and on the ground
Grime, grime, everywhere
In your mouth and in your hair
Oh can't you see
This world's unclean
They say brush twice a day
I think that's not enough
Oh, can't you see
All this disease
The smell of sweaty feet
Makes me throw up
Filth, filth—
[Scene cuts back to reality; Teri is being carried to the ambulance van]
Teri: All around, in the air and on the ground...
Bandage Doctor: That is the worst case of J-pop I've ever seen.
Joan: Is it contagious?
Bandage Doctor: [Ironically appears dressed as a Japanese pop star] Absolutely not.
[The van is infected with J-pop; it drives away with musical wails, leading to Richard discussing with Larry at Joyful Burger]
Larry: I'm sorry, sir. I cannot in good conscience sell you a meal with that many calories. You might as well strap a hose to your face and pump a hundred pounds of hot lard directly down your throat.
Richard: Sure, I'll take one of those too.
Larry: Sir, so much unhealthy food is seriously dangerous for you.
Richard: Larry, let me tell you something about how I like my food. [Clears throat]
Larry: Yeah, is there any way we could skip this, sir—
I Prefer All My Food Fried
Richard: Maybe you didn't hear me
Larry: 'Cause I've, uh, got a line forming behind you, and-
Richard: When I asked for all those fries...
[The scene changes to Richard singing in a karaoke-style film]
Richard: I assure you, I spoke clearly
I said yes to super-sized
Spicy wings and some onion rings
With chicken nuggets on the side
Singers: Nuggets on the side...
Richard: I prefer all my food fried,
I prefer all my food fried!
Larry: Fine, fine, just please stop singing! Here's your bucket, sir. Have a nice day.
Richard: Ahh, I can feel my arteries hardening already!
[The chicken drumsticks grease and penetrate through the paper]
Richard: Huh? That's probably a bad sign.
[The chicken melts through the car]
Richard: That's definitely a bad sign.
Continuation of I'm Singing
[A drop of grease falls onto the sewer water]
Rat: Yuck! These sewers are a maze
Rat: And we haven't eaten in days
Both: But we're singing!
[They pop up to a restaurant]
Rat: Let's try here, there's no queues
Rat: That's because it's had awful reviews
Let's keep looking!
You're a Hairy Lady
[Miss Simian and Principal Brown are dating in the restaurant]
Lucy Simian: So I said to Steve, I said "How—
Nigel Brown: Are you okay, my sweet? You haven't said a word since we got here.
Lucy Simian: What? You interrupted me to say that? I was right in the middle of a—
Nigel Brown: Shh. There's no need to feel insecure. I know you see the way other women look at me.
Lucy Simian: No, Nigel. You promised you wouldn't do this.
Nigel Brown: You got something other girls don't have. Thick hair all over your body. Now just lie down and listen.
Lucy Simian: Nigel, I'm not going to lie down in a restaurant.
Nigel Brown: [Singing] You're a hairy lady
Hair from your head to your toes, girl
You're a hairy lady
You even got hair up your nose, girl
I see you talkin' with those other boys
I see you speakin', I don't hear no noise
Too busy lovin' all that fur, I see
Your body's hairier than a bumblebee
You're my honey, girl
Hairy girls, y'all best believe I'm a connoisseur
I look away if I don't see that matted fur
Hugging you is like a hug from a grizzly bear
Did I happen to mention I'm really into body hair, yeah
Larry: [Spoken] Oh, please, no.
Nigel Brown: [Spoken] You promised.
Larry: [Rapping] It's plain to see you give your barber every night off
Every drain in your house is a total write-off
Girl, you looking like a fur-covered miracle
And all those follicles, they got me waxing lyrical
Nigel Brown: 'Cause your hairy bod makes the guys all swoon
Don't shave or pluck or wax any time soo–
[Miss Simian breaks his arm; Principal Brown screams. Miss Simian causes chaos all over the restaurant]
Nigel Brown: Please, stop! Please, no, no!
Continuation of I'm Singing
[Nicole passes by driving her car; the showerhead is still in the trunk]
Showerhead: I'm claustrophobic, I can't breathe
She could've just asked me to leave
But I'm singing!
A Lovely Encounter With Pluto
[The scene rises up to the planets laughing]
Earth: Oi, oi, hey, hey, hey, who's this? Who's this? [Imitating Pluto] I didn't complete a single orbit before losing me planet status.
[The planets laugh; Pluto enters. The planets' laughter dies]
Mars: Pluto.
Earth: That's right, it's Pluto. Stripped of her planet status like a common moon. [Realizes Pluto's presence] Ah sorry, I, uh, I didn't see you there.
Pluto: So, uh, what you guys doing this evening?
Jupiter: Oh, you know, usual planet stuff. Bowling.
Pluto: That's— that's— that's cool— cool. [Chuckles]
Earth: So yeah, anyway, we'll see you around, I guess.
Pluto: Oh yeah. Cheers. [Chuckles] Have a— have a nice um... [Sighs]
The Hurt I Feel
Pluto: You know
It's mean
To be declassified after all these years
And rendered obsolete
And there's such a distance between us
Approximately four point six billion miles...
The hurt I feel is deep inside...
Singers: Deep inside...
Pluto: My planet status has been denied—
Singers: Been denied—
[Music stops]
Earth: Sorry, sorry, love. Can you keep it down a bit? You're putting Uranus off his strike.
Uranus: Actually, it's pronounced "Ur-anus."
Pluto: [Sighs] Why did I ever hang out with those dorks?
[Meteors enter]
Meteor: Hey toots, you going our way? We're off to trash a planet a few light years away. You want to tag along?
Meteor: You can join us if you're cool. [Drops 3D glasses] I'm not getting those back.
Pluto: Is minus two-hundred twenty-nine degrees cool enough for you?
[Pluto and the meteors cheer and go off-screen]
Pluto: Yeah!
Banana Joe's 5th Symphony
[Scene cuts to Banana Joe imitating Beethoven's 5th Symphony with a flashlight]
Banana Joe: Ba-na-na-naa! Ba-na-na-naa! Ba-na-na-na! Ba-na-na-na! Ba-na-na-naa! Ba-na-na-na! Ba-na-na-na! Ba-na-na-naa! Ba-na-na-naa! Ba-na-na-naa! Ba-na-na-na! Na! Naa! Ba-na-na— whoa!
[Banana Barbara opens the door, causing Banana Joe to launch into the ceiling fan; Banana Joe is splattered everywhere across the room]
Banana Barbara: Oh, sorry, honey, I didn't know the fan was on.
[Banana Joe groans. It appears to have been a video posted on Elmore Stream-It named "Classical fail."]

Final Part of I'm Singing
[The garbage truck dumps all the CDs in the dump, while Nicole driving in her car enters it]
Showerhead: [Muffled] Cast off, thrown away
But I won't let it ruin my day
'Cause I'm singing!
[Nicole retrieves it from the trunk and throws it across the many piles of garbage]
Showerhead: Ah, oh!
I'm cold and alone
And I fear that I'm not going home
But I'm singing!
