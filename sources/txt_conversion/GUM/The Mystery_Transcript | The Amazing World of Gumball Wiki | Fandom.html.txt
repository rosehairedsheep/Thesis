Who Did This?
[Gumball and Darwin are at school. Gumball is opening his locker]
Gumball: I think cheese is better than cake, because you can have cheesecake, but you can't have cake cheese.
[Gumball opens his locker. Suddenly, a large, wrapped object falls out onto the ground. Gumball gasps. Students all start to gather around the object]
Banana Joe: Ugh! What is it?
Tobias​: I don't know!
Leslie​: Ah, it smells like manure!
Alan​​​​​​​​: It looks like a rancid burrito.
Gumball: I think it just moved.
Penny: Somebody do something!
[Tobias pokes the wrapped up object with his stick]
Lucy Simian: What's going on here? What are you poking? Euugghh! It looks like a wet diaper!
[Miss Simian unravels the object, revealing Principal Brown, shaved and covered in paint]
Lucy Simian: Nigel!
Students: It's Principal Brown!
[Miss Simian cradles Principal Brown]
Lucy Simian: Oh, my sweet Nigel. Who would shave you, paint you, wrap you in toilet paper and shut you in Watterson's locker?! Who did this?
[The students look at Miss Simian]
Lucy Simian: Who did this?! I want everyone in class now!
[The students run to Miss Simian's classroom, revealing Rocky, who is cleaning the floor]
Lucy Simian: I said everyone!
[Rocky runs to with the rest of the class]
Rocky: Eww, what's that? It looks like—
Lucy Simian: We know what it looks like!
[Rocky gets back to running]
[Scene cuts to Miss Simian's classroom]
Lucy Simian: I'm taking Principal Brown to the nurse's office!
Nigel Brown: Nurse...
Lucy Simian: Come, Nigel.
[Miss Simian walks away, then pops back]
Lucy Simian: And if the culprit hasn't owned up by the time I get back, you're all in detention!
[Miss Simian slams the door of the classroom and leaves. Bobert is seen standing still at the stairs]
The Investigation
Gumball: So, what do you guys think happened to Principal Brown?
Sussie: Well, I saw him at the end of school, so it must have happened after that. [Giggles]
Tobias​​​​​​: So, who stayed after school yesterday?
Penny: I was doing cheerleader stuff!
Rocky: I was cleaning late.
Gumball: I had detention.
Darwin: I can't remember. [Makes a silly face]
Carmen: So, you are all suspects.
Banana Joe: Oh, c'mon, it was obviously Gumball!
Tobias​​​​​​: Yeah! Brown was found in his locker.
[Everyone looks angrily at Gumball. Darwin then follows suit]
Gumball: Guys, I didn't do it. But I'm gonna find out who did. And I think I know just how. Whoever did it, raise your hand!
[No one raises their hand]
Gumball: Okay, whoever didn't do it, raise your hand!
[Everyone raises their hand, except Alan. They all look at him]
Alan​​​​​​: What?
Gumball: Aha! So you did it! [Pokes him]
Alan​​​​​​: [Bumps Gumball back] Dude! I don't have any hands!
Gumball: Darn, you're good.
Penny: Aren't you supposed to... like... look for clues or something?
Gumball: Hmmm, clues... [Wanders through the classroom] Like those paint splatters all over your pompoms!
Suspect No. 1: Penny
[A big spotlight shines at Penny and everyone looks at her and gasps, surprised]
Penny: No, wait! I can explain!
Gumball: There's only one explanation, it was a crime of passion.
Penny: What do you mean?
Gumball: You knew Principal Brown put me in detention last night, and overwhelmed by your feelings for me, you confronted him in his office.
[A recreation plays similar to a film noir]
Penny: Please, let him go. I love him, Principal Brown!
Nigel Brown: He's nothing but a rogue!
Penny: But he's noble and strong and brave and handsome! So handsome! He might be the best looking guy in...
[Recreation fades back to Gumball, who finishes the sentence]
Gumball: [High-pitched voice] ...the whole school!
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Gumball, have you seen your yearbook photo?
[Leslie holds up a yearbook and points at Gumball's photo. He has a derpy pose and face on the photo]
Gumball: No interruptions, please. [Deep voice] We all know how handsome...
[Back to recreation]
Nigel Brown: ...Gumball is, but he's still in detention!
Penny: Then you leave me no choice!
Gumball: [Voice-over] It was then that you pompom'd him unconscious.
[Penny hits Principal Brown with her pompom. Then multiple scenes start playing as Gumball narrates]
Gumball: [Voice-over] Shaved off his hair to punish him, covered him in paint to humiliate him, wrapped him in toilet paper to keep him quiet, and stuffed him in my locker as proof of your deranged obsession for me!
[Penny laughs maniacally and sneak away from Gumball's locker in the last scene]
[End of recreation]
Gumball: It was you!
Penny: [Gasps]
Gumball: But I forgive you, because I am madly in love with you too.
Penny: Yeah, well, that's not quite what happened.
[Flashback to yesterday at the school stairwell, Penny hangs her finished painting]
Penny: [Voice-over] I had finally finished my painting of the cheerleaders, and I went to hang it in the stairwell. I guess it was still wet, and I must have got paint on my pompoms.
[Flashback ends]
Gumball: And did anyone see you supposedly hang this alleged painting in this "so-called" stairwell?
Penny: Yeah. You did.
[Flashback begins. Penny hangs her finished painting, as Gumball comes around the stairwell]
Gumball: Hey, Penny! I love you! Your painting! Your painting. I love your painting.
[Gumball facepalms and walks off. End of flashback]
Penny: Remember?
Gumball: [Laughs nervously] Oh, yeah.
[The spotlight switches off]
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: So if Penny didn't do it, who did?
Gumball: Hmmm. It must have been... you!
Suspect No. 2: Rocky
[Gumball points to Rocky, but the  spotlight does not switch on]
Gumball: I said it was him!
[The spotlight shines on Gumball but slowly moves to Rocky. Rocky and the students gasp when the spotlight shines on him]
Rocky: Why me?!
Gumball: Well...
[Another recreation begins. Rocky is walking in the hallway]
Gumball: [Voice-over] Yesterday, you were wandering around when suddenly, at the age of twenty-seven, you've realized your youth was behind you.
Rocky: Oh.
Gumball: [Voice-over] Then all your hair fell out.
[Rocky's hair falls out]
Rocky: Bummer.
[Principal Brown passes by while humming]
Gumball: [Voice-over] When you saw Principal Brown's lustrous hairy coat, you were overcome with jealousy. And acting on impulse, you attacked him.
[Rocky tackles Principal Brown, then numerous scenes start playing all at once]
Gumball: [Voice-over] You frantically plucked out all of his hair, dyed it the right color, and used it to cover your balding shame. Then, planning to mislead any investigation, you painted Principal Brown, wrapped him in toilet paper, and stuffed him into my locker, the perfect crime. Save for one thing!
Rocky: Huh?!
[End of recreation]
Gumball: When you stuck the new hair on your body, there wasn't quite enough, which explains this bald spot on your hand!
[The students gasp]
Rocky: Dude, you've got it all wrong! I got this bald spot when I was cleaning yesterday. You see, I spilled some really strong chemicals on my hand, and it burnt off the hair. See?
[Rocky spills the chemicals onto his arm]
Rocky: Aaaaaahhh!
Gumball: If that's the case, how come I can just pull your hair right off?
[Gumball tries to pull Rocky's hair]
Rocky: Agh! Oh! Stop!
[Gumball stops for a moment, then tries again]
Rocky: Ow! No! Agh!
Gumball: Oh, okay then, I guess it wasn't you.
[The spotlight switches off]
Darwin: Who could it be? All this suspense is making me sweaty.
Gumball: Why don't you just wipe your brow with that toilet paper suspiciously stuck to the bottom of your shoe? [Gasps] Clue! [Swells up tears] I can't believe I'm gonna have to say this, buddy, but, it was you!
Suspect No. 3: Darwin
[The students and Darwin gasp and the spotlight shines on Darwin]
Darwin: Yes! Yes! I did it! I'm a monster! A monster! Just lock me up! I'm a menace to society!
[Darwin falls on his knees, sobbing. He then plops on the floor]
Darwin: Take me away!
Gumball: I rest my case.
Carmen: But Darwin couldn't have done it!
[The spotlight switches off]
Darwin: Really?
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: We all saw you on the bus when we went home.
Darwin: Then how'd you explain the toilet paper?
[The spotlight shines on Darwin again]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: You've had it on your feet all day, dude, didn't you notice?
[Flashback to where Darwin is walking with toilet paper on his shoe, leaving a very long trail as he goes into different rooms. He goes down the hallway, up the stairs, down the stairs, back down the hallway, then onto the school bus, as the shutting door cuts it off]
Darwin: Nope!
[The spotlight switches off]
Darwin: Don't remember any toilet paper.
Final Suspect: Gumball
Gumball: So it wasn't Penny, it wasn't Rocky, and it wasn't Darwin. Which leaves us with only one suspect. The only person who knew the combination to the locker Principal Brown was found in. You!
[The students gasp as Gumball points at himself and the spotlight goes on him]
Gumball: Oh, heh heh.
Students: [Angrily] Hmm!
Lucy Simian: That's all the proof I need. You're coming with me, Watterson!
Gumball: Wait! You're forgetting one bit of crucial evidence!
Lucy Simian: And what's that?!
[The spotlight switches off]
Gumball: I'll just... go and get it. [Walks off]
[Brief silence]
Lucy Simian: He's not coming back, is he?
Students: No...
Lucy Simian: No homework for the one who catches him!
[The class runs off]
The Chase
[Gumball runs to the library. Molly, Leslie, Tina, Rocky, Tobias, Idaho, Carmen and Anton are blocking him, then Molly kicks Banana Joe out of his peel, but Gumball jumps over and Banana Joe lands in Anton's face becoming a Banana toast spread. Gumball then jumps over Molly and Leslie before rapidly sliding away on a ladder]
Gumball: Ahahaha!
[A book hits Gumball on the head, and it's revealed that Tobias, Anton and Idaho are also on a ladder chasing him]
Gumball: Ow!
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Quick! Give me something else to throw!
[Tobias and Anton look at Idaho]
Idaho: What?
[Idaho gets thrown at Gumball and hits him in the head]
Idaho: Aah!
Gumball: Stop throwing stuff at me, I'm innocent!
[Gumball, Tobias, and Anton fly to bookshelves, causing Carrie, Juke, and Teri to look up from their books. Then Gumball jumps from the falling bookshelves, Tina tries to eat him but misses, causing the bookshelves to fall on her]
Tina: Ouch.
Librarian: Shh!
[Gumball is back in the hallway, running from Tina, Tobias, Anton, and Leslie]
Gumball: Leave me alone! I'm innocent! I would never hurt Principal Brown!
[Scene cuts to Principal Brown on a metal bed in the nurse's office]
Nigel Brown: I think I'm feeling a little better.
[Gumball runs into his bed, causing him to crash through the window]
Nigel Brown: Aaaaaah! [Lands on the ground]
Gumball: [Gasps]
[The students gather around the broken window, as Gumball looks at them nervously and sneaks away]
Nigel Brown: This is extraordinarily painful. It couldn't possibly get any worse!
[A school bus reverses and runs over him off-screen. A crunch sound is heard]
Students: Ohhhh!
The True Culprit
[Gumball runs into a shut off Bobert]
Gumball: Bobert? Ah! Don't turn me in! Oh, you've been switched off.
[Gumball turns Bobert on]
Gumball: Ah! Don't turn me in!
Bobert: Why?
Gumball: Principal Brown was attacked, and everyone thinks it was me!
Bobert: But it wasn't you.
Gumball: Exactly! Wait, how come you believe me?
Bobert: I saw... everything.
Gumball: What?!
Lucy Simian: GUMBAAAAAAAALL!! GET HIM!!
[Everyone runs toward Gumball screaming]
Gumball: STOOOOOOOOP!
[Everyone stops on their tracks]
Gumball: New evidence has come to light! Tell them what happened, dude!
Bobert: I can do better than that. I can play you my memory.
[Bobert projects a hologram to show the footage as he narrates it]
Bobert: [Voice-over] First, Penny hung her hideous painting on the wall.
Penny: [Off-screen] Hey!
Bobert: [Voice-over] Then, Gumball turned up, looking love struck as usual.
Gumball: [Off-screen] Hey!
Bobert: [Voice-over] Next, Darwin walked down the stairs, trailing toilet paper like a nincompoop.
Darwin: [Off-screen] What's a nincompoop?
Gumball: [Off-screen; whispering] Somebody like you.
Darwin: [Off-screen] Hey!
Bobert: [Voice-over] Then, Rocky dropped a bottle of chemicals on the floor, looking quite old.
Rocky: [Off-screen] Hey!
Bobert: [Voice-over] And finally came Principal Brown, whose office door suddenly flew open, leaving him disoriented and dizzy. He fell down the stairs, rolling himself in Darwin's toilet paper, smashed into Penny's artwork, covering his face in paint, then fell back into Rocky's chemicals, burning off his hair, then down more stairs, wrapping himself into even more toilet paper, and finally into Gumball's locker.
[The hologram ends]
Penny: But why didn't you say something before?
Bobert: Well, it was so funny, I blew a fuse. I was like, "Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha." [Blows a fuse and shuts down]
Gumball: He's done it again.
[Gumball turns Bobert back on]
Bobert: On.
Penny: So, the true culprit is the person who threw open Principal Brown's door!
Gumball: Exactly. And I know just how to find out. Whoever opened the door, put your hand up.
[No one raises their hand]
Gumball: Oh, come on!
Bobert: Why don't I just replay the tape?
[Replays the footage quickly]
Gumball: Stop there!
[The video stops the video on the part of Principal Brown walking down the hallway]
Gumball: Now forward slowly.
[Footage slowly moves]
Gumball: Freeze!
[Video pauses on the door swinging open, hitting Principal Brown]
Gumball: There. Zoom in fifty percent.
[The video does as told]
Gumball: Zoom in one-hundred percent.
[The video does as told again]
Gumball: Zoom in another one-hundred percent.
[The video does as told yet again]
Gumball: Enhance video.
[The video enhances and reveals it was Miss Simian who opened the door all along. The students gasp in shock]
Gumball: It was you all along! We're going to tell Principal Brown!
Lucy Simian: Tell him what?
Gumball: What we just saw on Bobert's memory.
Lucy Simian: What memory?
[Miss Simian erases Bobert's memory]
Bobert: Erase memoryyyyyyy. [Slowly] Who... am I?
Darwin: That's not fair!
Gumball: How do you sleep at night, Miss Simian?
Lucy Simian: Like a baby. [Laughs evilly]
[Principal Brown opens his door suddenly, which knocks Miss Simian off-screen]
Lucy Simian: Aaaaaah!
Nigel Brown: Has anyone seen Miss Simian?
[Miss Simian crashes through a window]
Lucy Simian: Aaaaaah! [Lands on the ground]
[The students gather around the broken window]
Darwin: Don't worry, Miss Simian! We just called an ambulance!
[An ambulance reverses and runs over Miss Simian off-screen. A crunch sound is heard]
Students: Ohhhhh!
[Episode ends]
