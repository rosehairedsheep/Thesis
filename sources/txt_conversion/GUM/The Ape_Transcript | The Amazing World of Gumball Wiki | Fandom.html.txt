The Last Trophy
[Rocky is seen polishing some trophies of Miss Simian, when her reflection is seen in the glass. Rocky yelps and drops the trophy]
Lucy Simian: [Dives toward the trophy] Careful, numbskull! These trophies are symbols of my excellence as a teacher. It took me 754 years to collect them all.
[Rocky mumbles]
Lucy Simian: What was that?!
Rocky: Hello! "Favorite teacher award"? It's like the best one and stuff, but you'll never win it.
Lucy Simian: Why not?
Rocky: Because you need a letter of recommendation from a student who, uh... actually likes you.
Lucy Simian: That sounds easy enough.
Rocky: [Laughs] Seriously, though, no one likes you, Miss Simian. Not even me! And I like everybody.
[Rocky runs away]
Lucy Simian: Nobody likes me? Hmm...
In Class
[Miss Simian continues to think even in class as Gumball and Darwin watch her]
Gumball: Dude, I think something's wrong with Miss Simian.
Darwin: What makes you say that?
Gumball: She hasn't told anyone off all day.
[Gumball faces behind. The camera changes views, showing all members of the class causing a massive chaos]
Darwin: That is weird.
[The school bell rings]
Gumball: Hey, guys! Wait up!
Lucy Simian: Gumball?
Gumball: [Nervous] Yeah...?
Lucy Simian: You and I are friends, right?
Gumball: [Faces to Miss Simian] Are we?
Lucy Simian: Well, what with all the detentions and everything, I guess we spend a lot of time together.
Gumball: Uhh... I guess so. Anyway, gotta go.
Lucy Simian: Just one more thing. Would you mind if I hang out with you just for a little while?
Gumball: Uh... yeah. Yeah, I would. [Walks out of the class]
Break Time
[Scene changes to Gumball and Darwin in the school yard]
Gumball: Basically, she asked to be my friend. Well, I told her "no," obviously. [Camera pans to Miss Simian] But she's just following me around.
[Scene location changes to the cafeteria, where Gumball, Darwin and Miss Simian having lunch together]
Gumball: And the strangest thing is, she's completely unresponsive. Watch. [Launches a pea using a spoon into Miss Simian's face, gaining no response from her] See? Nothing!
Darwin: Hmm. Try something hot.
Return to Home
[Gumball and Darwin are on the way to their home, with Miss Simian following them]
Gumball: [To Darwin, nervously] Is she still there? [Faces behind, camera view changes to Miss Simian]
Darwin: Yep.
[Darwin starts walking with Gumball for a few steps before turning to Miss Simian again]
Darwin: Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!!
[Brief silence]
Darwin: Huh?
Gumball: [Grabs a stick and throws it toward Miss Simian] Fetch!
[Miss Simian acts depressed and does nothing, then they give up]
Gumball: [Sighs] I hope things get better tomorrow. [Continues walking with Darwin]
Unexpected Guest
[Scene changes in front of the Wattersons' house, from which slurping can be heard. Scene changes inside, with the Wattersons watching Miss Simian drinking milk from a bowl of cereal]
Nicole: What is she doing in my house?
Lucy Simian: [Stops] I'm sorry. I just that maybe we could share a nice breakfast together, but since you all hate me, [Stands up] I'll just go. [Approaches the door] I'm walking.
Darwin: [Sadly] It's so sad.
Lucy Simian: This is me... on my way. I'm at the door... [Grabs the door knob]
Anais: [Sadly] This is kind of harsh.
Lucy Simian: I'm turning the door knob. [Turns the knob] I'm opening the door. [Opens the door]
Richard: [Starts crying] I don't know why, but I'm crying!
Lucy Simian: Boy, it sure looks lonely out there. [Shuts the door]
Gumball: [Cries] Mom, why do you hate Miss Simian so much?
Nicole: [Annoyed] I don't want to talk about it.
Darwin: [Crying] Please, let her stay!
Nicole: [Sighs] Okay. She can stay, but—
[Miss Simian interrupts Nicole from the window]
Lucy Simian: Oh, thank you! You're such a kind and friendly family! [Camera zooms] You know, [Heads down] I never had friends before. I don't even know what friends do.
Gumball: Don't worry. We'll show you.
Therapy Session
[Gumball, Darwin and Miss Simian are outside of the house]
Gumball: Now, a very important part of friendship is sharing. Imagine you both have ice creams.
Darwin and Lucy Simian: Oh. [Pretend they are holding ice cream]
[Darwin moves his tongue as if licking ice cream]
Gumball: But what's this? Darwin has dropped his ice cream.
[Gumball waits for Darwin to mimic the ice cream dropping, but Darwin doesn't stop licking]
Gumball: I said, "Darwin has dropped his ice cream."
[He wings his hands over Darwin's hand as he knocks over Darwin's ice cream]
Gumball: Splat!
Darwin: [Stops briefly, then looks down] You got it on my shoes.
Lucy Simian: Uh, do you want to share mine? [Moves her hands as she breaks her ice cream in half]
Gumball: [Gasps] Very good.
Lucy Simian: Ice cream, Darwin? [Hands her hand as she gives an ice cream to Darwin]
Darwin: Aw, thanks! [Starts moving his tongue as he licks the ice cream again]
Lucy Simian: But, Gumball, you don't have an ice cream. Want to share mine?
Gumball: Sure!
[Miss Simian starts licking, then Gumball also starts licking, literally, but then stops licking]
Gumball: Oh... [Starts licking again]
[Camera zooms to Gumball's tongue trying to avoid touching Miss Simian's tongue, then he gives up]
Gumball: Dude, [Whispering to Darwin] this is so gross!
Darwin: Why don't you pretend you have your own ice cream?
Gumball: [Sighs and facepalms] Ugh! Why didn't I think of that?
Hi-Face
[Scene changes to the bench area in a Stadium]
Gumball: Friends also high-five, like this.
Gumball and Darwin: [Toss] High-five!
Gumball: Okay, now—
[Miss Simian pushes her hand into Gumball's face]
Gumball: No, I mean slap my—
[Miss Simian repeats the same thing]
Gumball: Let's move on to the next lesson.
Dodge or Dare
[Scene changes to the Wattersons' backyard]
Gumball: How about we all play game, like friends do? Here's one we made up. It's called...
Gumball and Darwin: Dodge or Dare!
Gumball: Roll the dice.
[Miss Simian rolls the dice]
Gumball: Take a card.
[Miss Simian takes a card]
Gumball and Darwin: What'd you get?
Lucy Simian: "Put a gooey hair ball in Miss Simian's lunch."
Gumball: [Gasps] L-Let me take that.
[Gumball takes the card that Miss Simian had and hands her a deck of cards, which Miss Simian takes one of them]
Gumball: Pick another.
Lucy Simian: "When Miss Simian's back is turned—"
Gumball: [Chuckles] A-Actually, let me pick one for you. [Starts searching for cards] Uh, cover Simian in slug juice, drop water balloons on Simian, Miss Simian, Miss Simian, Miss Simian— [Throws the cards away and giggles] Heh heh. Forget the cards. Here's a dare: make the most annoying noise possible.
Lucy Simian: [Brief pause, then attempts to scream] Eeeh...
Gumball: O... kay. That was... good, but we know that you can do better.
Darwin: Like when you're mad at us.
Lucy Simian: Oh, you mean this little thing? GUUUUUUUUUMBAAAAAAALL!!!
[Miss Simian's scream is so loud that it produces ultrasonic residue and makes both Gumball's and Darwin's skin slides back and shows their insides of their mouth]
Gumball and Darwin: That... was... awesome!
Gumball: High-five!
[As before, Miss Simian pushes her hands into Gumball and Darwin's faces]
Gumball: That still needs a little work.
[View changes to backyard window, with Nicole watching Gumball, Darwin and Miss Simian while doing her dishwashing]
Nicole: I've got my eye on you, Simian.
Family Fun
[Scene changes to the living room of the Wattersons' house where Richard is laughing on the couch]
Richard: Ha-ha-ha-ha. Do it again! Do it again!
[Camera zooms out showing Miss Simian blowing into Richard's stomach again, while Nicole watches the family laughing. Richard falls off the couch, laughing and revealing Darwin standing behind him]
Lucy Simian: [Hugging Gumball, Darwin and Anais] I'm so pleased to finally have such great friends!
Gumball, Darwin, Richard, and Anais: Ahhh! We love you, Miss Simian.
[Camera zooms to Nicole]
Nicole: Sorry, kids. Miss Simian, c-can I have a word with you [Angrily] in private, please?
[View changes to the dining room]
Lucy Simian: [Sits on a dining chair] Yes, Nicole, how can I help you?
Nicole: Listen, Simian, you might have the rest of them fooled, but I don't trust you for a second. [Lunges forward] I remember you from school. I remember the horrible name you used to call me everyday. 
[Camera zooms towards Nicole and Miss Simian] 
Nicole: Do you remember that?
Lucy Simian: [Regretful] Yes, I do. And I'm sorry.
[Camera zooms to Nicole]
Nicole: [Surprised] What?
[Then to Miss Simian]
Lucy Simian: I was that horrid person for so long, and look where it got me. No friends, no family, [Covers her face] just bitterness and wrinkles.
[Camera zooms to Nicole who is still surprised and back to Miss Simian again]
Lucy Simian: [Hugging herself] But even an old ape can change. [Points to Nicole] Will you give me that chance?
Nicole: [Thinks for a second] Oh, I don't know. It's all happening so fast.
[Miss Simian rushes forward and hugs Nicole from behind]
Lucy Simian: Ple-e-e-e-e-ase?
Nicole: [Shudders] Okay, I'll-I'll give it another shot.
The Letter
[Scene changes to Front of Wattersons' house, then into the living room]
Gumball: What do we do now, best friends?
Lucy Simian: Uh, let's see. I know! Best friends write letters to each other about how great they are. [Gives a notepad to Gumball]
Gumball: Wow! What a... friendly idea. [Takes the notepad] What shall we write?
Lucy Simian: Um...ooh... How about "We, the aforementioned, unanimously agree that Miss Simian is worthy of this year's Favorite Teacher Award."
Gumball: "Favorite Teacher Award." Okay! Done it!
[Miss Simian quickly takes the notepad from Gumball, and laughs maniacally]
Lucy Simian: It's mine! [Holds the notepad into her chest]
[Miss Simian dances away in glee as hip-hop music plays]
Lucy Simian: Ah-a! Ha-mmm! Ah-mmm! Ah-a! Ah-a! Uh-hmm! Uh-mmm!
[Scene changes to the window]
Darwin: Look how happy she is.
Gumball: That's the power of friendship.
Horrible Memories
[Scene changes to Elmore Junior High]
Gumball: Wow! You baked that cake for Miss Simian?
Nicole: Yeah. I think she deserves a second chance. [Walking towards Rocky] Is Miss Simian around?
Rocky: Nah, dude. She just drove off. You should've seen her, all dancing and laughing, saying she finally got some losers to write her a "Favorite Teacher" nomination.
[The scene goes slow-motion, Nicole gasps and drops the cake, which shatters upon hitting the floor]
Nicole: [Anxiously] What was the word she used?
Rocky: [Slow-motion] "Losers."
[Nicole's eyes grow wide and the scene changes to a flashback of her as a baby, falling after a few steps, and feeling sad]
Nicole: Unh!
Lucy Simian: Heh! Nice first steps, loser!
[Nicole, as a kid, falls from a bike that was hitting a rock]
Nicole: Unh!
Lucy Simian: [Laughs] Nice cycling, loser!
[Nicole, as a student, reading a poem in class]
Lucy Simian: Nice "poem," loser!
[At the school reunion dance]
Lucy Simian: Nice hair, loser.
[At Nicole's wedding with Richard, Miss Simian passes by with her car]
Lucy Simian: Nice husband, loser! [Laughs maniacally]
[End of flashback. Scene returns to the school]
Nicole: [Angrily] Everyone, get back in the car.
Richard: [Eating Nicole's cake off the floor] Now?
The Chase
[Scene changes to Miss Simian driving in her car down the expressway]
Lucy Simian: [Laughing] Soon the trophy will be mine!
[Nicole bumps into the rear-end of Miss Simian's car with her own car]
Nicole: We'll see about that, you two-faced baboon!
Lucy Simian: There's nothing you can do about it, loser!
Gumball: Mom! What are you doing?!
Nicole: Something I should have done a long time ago. [Presses down on gas pedal]
[Nicole and Miss Simian's cars bump a few times. Gumball, Anais, and Darwin sway as the car shakes]
Nicole: Kids, throw stuff at her!
Gumball: But isn't that dangerous?
Nicole: Not as dangerous as disobeying your mother!
[Gumball, Darwin and Anais grab soda cans]
Gumball: Sorry! Eh! [Throws the soda cans outside the window]
[Miss Simian begins to swerve]
Lucy Simian: Ah! Oh! Aaah!
Anais: [Reaches for candy in the car seat] Open your mouth.
[Anais loads the candy into Darwin's mouth, and he fires it at Miss Simian like a machine gun. The candy cracks Miss Simian's windshield]
Lucy Simian: Aah! Ohh!
Gumball: I hope you like pepperoni! [Drops a pizza box on her windshield]
Lucy Simian: Aaaaaah!
[Miss Simian's car into the rails and drives tilted for a little while. She notices the recommendation letter about to fly out and grabs it]
Lucy Simian: That was close!
[Miss Simian's car tilts back to normal,but she rides off a ramp made of dirt]
Lucy Simian: [Midair] Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!
Gumball: Cool!
Lucy Simian: Not coo-o-o-o-l!
[Miss Simian's car lands right side up]
Darwin: I thought you were our friend, Miss Simian.
Lucy Simian: Ha! Who needs friends when you have this letter? [Notices the letter isn't in her hand] Aah! Huh?
[The letter is stuck on Miss Simian's car antenna]
Nicole: There it is, Richard! Get it!
Richard: Do what?!
Nicole: I'll get closer, and you'll lean in and grab it.
Richard: Seriously?
[Nicole gives him a serious look, and Richard rolls down the window]
Richard: [Reaches out the window] Little bit closer, honey! Ooh! Almost... there! Aah!
Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: Dad!
[Richard holding on to both cars]
Richard: Oooh-whoo! Whoo-oooh!
Nicole: Hold on! [Drives closer to Miss Simian]
Richard: Waaah-ha!
[Richard's head falls through Miss Simian's car window]
Richard: Hi.
Lucy Simian: Bye! [Repeatedly slaps Richard in the face with her palm]
Richard: Ow!
[The cars break through the rail as a truck approaches them]
All: Aaaaaaaah!
[The two cars separate when the truck goes by. The cars then come closer and Richard is standing on both cars]
Richard: [Grabs letter] Got it! Ha ha! Aaaaaah!
[Richard drops letter, which gets wrapped around the antenna again, when he sees rail]
[The cars separate and Richard is left running on a car ramp until he goes flying into the air]
Richard: Whoooooa! [Explodes somewhere off the road in the woods]
Nicole: [Bumping into Miss Simian as she says each word] Never... trick... my... family... again!
Anais: Mom, watch out! [Nicole swerves]
Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: [Spinning] Wooooaaah!
Lucy Simian: [Laughs] Aaah! [Smashes through a warning sign]
[Nicole's car stops]
Nicole: [Panting heavily] And that, kids, is why you wear seatbelts.
Gumball: Where's Miss Simian?
Lucy Simian: Uh... huh... ah... ah-hey!
[Scene changes to Miss Simian trying to reach the letter on her windshield, and her car tipping over the ledge]
Gumball: Miss Simian, no!
[Miss Simian looks towards Gumball]
Gumball: You could still be friends with us if you like.
[Miss Simian glances at the letter, then glances at Gumball, Darwin, and Anais]
Lucy Simian: Nah! [Grabs the letter, and the car falls of the ledge] Aaaaaaaaaah!
[Gumball, Darwin, Anais, and Nicole look over the ledge as a crash and explosion are heard]
Gumball: Ohhh.
Richard: What did I miss?
Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: Dad!
Nicole: Oh, just Simian taking a little tumble.
Richard: Maybe that'll teach her for "monkeying around."
All: [Laugh]
Nicole: We shouldn't laugh. She may be seriously hurt.
Richard: Well, you shouldn't have "gibbon" her a second chance.
All: [Laugh]
Nicole: No, really. That's enough.
Richard: Well, she shouldn't have "orangu-tangled" with us.
All: [Laugh]
Nicole: I said that's enough.
So Worth it
[Scene changes to Miss Simian (bandaged and in a wheelchair) putting a trophy on her shelf in school]
