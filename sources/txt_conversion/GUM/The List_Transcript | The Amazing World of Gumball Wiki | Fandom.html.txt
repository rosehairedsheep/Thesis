Realizing Nicole's Sacrifices
[The episode begins with Nicole looking at her old stuff in her bedroom, then she sighs]
Gumball: Mom? What are you doing?
Nicole: Oh, just looking at this list of dreams that I traded with this list of chores.
Gumball: Uh... you might want to add cleaning the house to it.
Nicole: What? How? I just finished cleaning literally two minutes ago. How could you guys make a mess so quickly?
Gumball: Hmm...
[A flashback occurs, depicting Gumball and Darwin getting their milk carton and cereal. However, items around the kitchen are chaotically falling out and breaking on their own, causing a mess around the kitchen; the flashback ends]
Gumball: Just by being kids, I guess.
[Items around the bedroom are falling and breaking on their own; Nicole sighs]
Darwin: What's wrong, Mrs. Mom?
Nicole: Oh, nothing. It's just when you grow up, reality gets in the way of your ambitions. Like, I always thought I would go to college. Instead, I majored in shopping with coupons with a minor in tension headaches.
Darwin: What are you talking about? Look at this! [Pulls a certificate out of a box] You got a PhD!
Gumball: In petty theft, it appears. This belongs to some girl called Kathy Taylor.
Nicole: [Laughing nervously while snatching the certificate] How did that get there?
Gumball: Whoa.
[Gumball pulls out a stack of photos: the first is Nicole enjoying while belly dancing. From there, her bright moods degenerates to a horrendous, tremendously exhausted mood as she raises her children]
Gumball: I never realized how much you had to give up for us. I mean, look at these vacation pictures.
Nicole: Oh, I gave up all my hopes and dreams, and now I have nothing to show for it.
Darwin: That's not true. Mr. Dad said you have lots of wrinkles.
[Nicole grunts in annoyance; Darwin grows anxious]
Gumball: Okay, let me paint a picture of what your life would have been like if you've never had us.
[A vision occurs, presenting Nicole, given tending upon by servants while dressed in a classically stylized manner]
Nobleman: [Offscreen] I'm begging your pardon, milady, but the Duke of Camembert requests the pleasure of your company, for supper at the Château.
Nicole: Ha! Tell him I'm not here. He'll call again if he's serious,.
[The vision ends]
Gumball: And so the Duke arrives in person on horseback, and he's like, ripped, and he—
Darwin: Dude!
Gumball: So yeah, and then, and then, you get married and become super rich, but it-it turns out that he chews his toenail, so... deal's off.
Darwin: Sorry you had to give up so much for us.
Gumball: Is there anything we can do to help?
Nicole: You can do my chores.
Gumball: Yeah, yeah, that's cool, we can do a chore.
Nicole: Chores. Plural. [Gets out a list of chores]
[Gumball reluctantly snatches the list, and frowns]
Get a Degree
[Scene transitions to Elmore Junior High]
Gumball: Right, number one: get a degree. [Reading from a computer] "First question: [Sighs] what is your credit card number? [Enters credit card number] Congratulations: you are now a doctor."
[The printer produces a diploma, in which Darwin grabs it and celebrates, along with Gumball. They adopt a baby face and voice]
Darwin: But what is a doctor of holistic medicine?
Gumball: It's kind of like a doctor, but instead of using science, you use... imagination!
[Scene now focuses on Gary, who falls and passes out; the librarian notices]
Tree Librarian: [Whispering] Help! Is there a doctor in the library?!
Darwin: What do we do?!
Gumball: We do the next chore on the list: save someone's life.
Save Someone's Life
[Gumball and Darwin run up to Gary]
Gumball: Stand back!
Tree Librarian: You look awfully young to be a doctor.
Gumball: [Chuckles] Well, you look awfully young to be a librarian.
Tree Librarian: [Blushing] Oh, stop, please, go ahead, good doctor.
Gumball: Darwin, please, the holistic candles! [Gets candles]
[The holistic candles are placed in a triangle format around Gary's head; nothing happens]
Gumball: Darn it! It's worse than I thought! I'm gonna need two amethysts and a lapis lazuli! [Puts the amethyst gems in Gary's nostrils and the lapis lazuli on his forehead]
[Gary regains consciousness and chokes]
Darwin: He's not breathing!
Gumball: We're losing him! Engage reiki massage.
[Darwin prepares in position to "give off energy"]
Gumball: Okay, clear!
[Darwin rubs his hands and gives off energy, screaming]
Gumball: Again! Clear!
[Darwin repeats the process; Gary passes out, seeming dead]
Gumball: Looks like he's gone...
[Gary barely regains consciousness, his nostrils stretched out]
...na make it after all! [Brings up list] Saving a life— done.
[Gary groans at them, whistling with his nostrils; Gumball laughs nervously]
Getting Something Named After Me
[Gumball and Darwin run away from Gary across the streets of Elmore; Darwin notices something and stops]
Darwin: [Gasps] Have you seen this? We've got arrest warrants on our heads for medical malpractice.
Gumball: [Gasps] Does it have our names on it?
Darwin: Yes!
Gumball: [Gasps] Awesome!
Darwin: Really?
Gumball: Yeah, another one off the list: getting something named after us.
Darwin: Oh, great. What next?
Gumball: "Win a marathon."
Darwin: Good, 'cause we're gonna need to get away from here fast. There's only so much time these acupuncture needles will buy us.
[Both notice Gary, scream and run away; Gary, full of needles all over his face, enters in]
Gary: Come back here, you little— Wait, this stuff does work. The pain my chest is totally gone... becuase my face hurts so much. [Moans and falls]
Win a Marathon
[Gumball pops up during a marathon]
Gumball: You okay, dude?
Darwin: [Appearing] Hmm, I thought that doing a marathon would be more hardcore.
Gumball: I know, right? We're so close I can already taste that gold medal. [Trying to taste] Ah, tastes like coins.
Darwin: [Looking down] Come on, guys! Can you pick up the pace a little?
[Scene reveals that Mr. Corneille and the Hexagon Lady are carrying Gumball and Darwin, respectively]
Moonchild Corneille: [Weakly] Anything for a sick child. This is why we run.
Gumball: What, to cure children? How does that work? You're the only one getting fitter here.
Moonchild Corneille: It's about raising awareness, showing others what good people we are.
[Both of the runners cross the finish line, and collapse, several Elmore residents surrounding the track, cheering them; the Cupcake Man enters in with two gold medals]
Moonchild Corneille: No, give the medal to them. These sick children are the real winners.
Gumball: Oh, thanks.
[Gumball and Darwin step on their heads and walk]
Hexagon lady: Wait, you can walk?!
Gumball: [Along with Darwin, receiving the gold medals] Yep. And fortunately for us, you can't anymore.
[Both exit]
Hexagon lady: Why, you little— [Tries to get up, but falls, then tries to, by any way she can, at least catch up and reach Gumball and Darwin]
Learn how to Play the Trumpet [Win a Symphony]
[Scene switches to Elmore Junior High; Leslie is about to begin his flute solo in front of the audience. Gumball pushes him off, imitating a trumpet with his mouth, and Principal Brown appears to agree with his rendition. The orchestra accompanies. Gumball now exits the school, along with Darwin]
Gumball: Learn how to play the trumpet: check. Hmm, start your own business.
The Stump Butler [Start Your Own Business]
[The scene switches to a shot of Gumball reaching for a mug of coffee on his kitchen counter, rendered in film grain to imitate an infomercial]
Infomercial Spokesman: Are you tired of your hands?
[Gumball cautiously blows on the coffee before dumping it all over his face and screaming. A red "X" appears on the screen]
Infomercial Spokesman: Too sensitive!
[Gumball is shown running and tries to grab his phone out of his pocket, but he panics as it repeatedly slips out of his hands. Another red "X" appears on the screen]
Infomercial Spokesman: Too sweaty!
[Hot Dog Guy is shown putting his hand on a bus pole and caressing Gumball's, causing him to freak out and run away screaming. Another red "X" appears on the screen]
Infomercial Spokesman: Too awkward!
[Gumball tries to pet a dog, but it bites his hand, causing him to scream and flail it around. Yet another red "X" appears on the screen.]
Infomercial Spokesman: Too sausage..y... Well, after years of research, our scientists have come up with a solution. We proudly present the Stump Butler.
[Gumball is shown putting on the Stump Butler, a hook hand, and poses with it.]
Infomercial Spokesman: No more butter fingers, because no more fingers!
[Gumball smashes the hook through the center of a coffee mug, pouring a single drop into his mouth and smiling while making a thumbs-up. A green check appears on the screen]
Infomercial Spokesman: No more sweaty fingers, because no more fingers!
[Gumball, while running, smashes his phone with his hook to retrieve it, smiles, and gives a thumbs-up. Another green check appears on the screen]
Infomercial Spokesman: No more awkward touching, because no more fingers!
[Gumball pierces through the bus pole that Hot Dog Guy is holding onto, causing him to recoil in shock. Gumball looks at him with a brief glimmer of victory before turning to the camera and smiling with a thumbs-up. Another green check appears on the screen]
Infomercial Spokesman: Even animals love it!
[A dog is shown flinching and whimpering as Gumball pets it using the Stump Butler]
Infomercial Spokesman: The Stump Butler, the truly hands-free solution!
[The scene cuts to Richard watching the commercial in the living room]
Infomercial Spokesman: Order your Stump Butler now for only five hundred dollars a pair!
Richard: What? Five hundred dollars? What do they think I am, employed?
[Darwin appears in the commercial with a headset]
Darwin: Hold on, viewers! For the next hour, I've been authorized to drop the price on these Stump Butlers by four hundred dollars!
Richard: [Gasps] Honey! Where's your purse?!
[Richard claws his way off the sofa and over to the landline. He tries to pick up the phone, but it repeatedly slips out of his hand, infuriating him]
Richard: GAH! CURSE THESE USELESS HANDS!
Make a Difference to Someone's Life
[An ATM shows Gumball and Darwin's Stump Butler profits shooting to the million dollar mark]
Darwin: Become millionaires: check.
Gumball: Next one is... "Make a difference to someone's life."
Gumball and Darwin: Hmm...
[The Hobo, sitting across from them, clears his throat]
Gumball: Mmm...
Darwin: So many dollars! How could we help someone with that money?
[The Hobo continues to cough]
Gumball: Okay, it's not quite there yet, but I've got this vision of us pouring the money into a lake.
Darwin: It's not quite there, but there's something in it. Maybe a furnace. Some kind of incinerator.
Gumball: Yeah, we could warm up a whole buncha people that way!
[The Hobo's coughing intensifies and he sprawls across the concrete; Gumball and Darwin take notice]
Gumball: [Laughing] What were we thinking? The answer is right in front of us! This guy needs help! Let's buy him some cough medicine.
[The Hobo whimpers]
Gumball: Just kidding, dude. Have at it.
[The Hobo gasps in excitement. Gumball then withdraws all of the money in the ATM for the Hobo, causing bills to spit out of it]
Hobo: [Laughing] Thank you guys! Thank you! Thank you! Oh, that's too much, you guys are nuts! Oh, this is crazy, thank you! [The stack of bills around the Hobo begin to take over the screen] Oh, wait! Oh [Muffled] wait! No, no! HELP!
Beat a Shaolin Monk
[A monk made of a cup of ramen is shown meditating in a temple. He is suddenly struck in the back of the head by Gumball with a frying pan, causing him to collapse onto the floor while his noodles spill out]
Darwin: Wait, you can't just hit an unarmed old guy with a frying pan!
Gumball: He's a quadruple black belt. His hands are legally considered as weapons.
Darwin: Mmm. [Pulls out list] Beat a Shaolin monk: check. What's next?
Climb a Mountain
[Gumball and Darwin are shown grunting and climbing a mountain. Gumball reaches a ledge and halts]
Gumball: [Breathless] Alright. I think that's enough of that.
Darwin: But we haven't got to the top yet!
Gumball: All it says on the list is "Climb a mountain." We've climbed it.
[Gumball starts to climb down the mountain, revealing he was only a few feet above a parking lot. He walks away disinterestedly while Darwin, tied to him by a rope, gets dragged off]
Save the Dolphins
[Gumball and Darwin hoist a dolphin ashore; Nicole confronts them]
Nicole: Oh, there you are! I've been looking for you for hours!... What are you doing?
Gumball: Saving the dolphins!
[The dolphin chirps angrily]
Nicole: From what?
Darwin: Drowning?
[Nicole sighs and facepalms before quickly throwing the dolphin back into the ocean]
Nicole: What have you two been up to?
Gumball: Uh, tu lista de obligaciones, mamá? [Subtitles: "Your chores list mom."] Why else do you think we learned to speak Spanish?
Nicole: Wait a minute. This isn't the chores list. It's my dream list that I wrote when I was sixteen!
Darwin: [Sighs] I wish you'd told us that before we let Chad Johnson take us to the prom.
Nicole: What?!
Gumball: He was a true gentleman.
Nicole: So, you really did all this stuff?
Gumball: Well... yeah.
Nicole: You're lying.
Darwin: I don't know, Mrs. Mom. Maybe the real lie is telling yourself that at some point in your life, you lose the opportunity to change it.
Nicole: Oh! That's a very mature thing to say, honey.
Darwin: Thank you! It's from that movie about a poodle who proved to the world he could play ping-pong.
[Nicole laughs in disbelief; Gumball and Darwin shrug to each other]
Gumball: Want to do the last one on the list with us?
Nicole: [Laughing] Of course.
Gumball: Then pack your bags. We're going on a round-the-world trip.
See the World
[Scene changes to Gumball, Darwin and Nicole, all dressed as tourists, sitting in the childrens' bedroom; Gumball and Darwin are on the computer]
Nicole: But how? It'll cost too much.
Gumball: Nowadays you don't need money to travel. [Typing] Welcome to the twenty-first century.
[The computer, having been searched for Elmore Maps, shows the frontal view of the Wattersons' house]
Nicole: Uh, guys, I have been outside our house before.
Gumball: [Turns the view 90 degress right] Ah-ah-ah. Just wait a minute, Mom. [Clicks to relocate on the Elmore Highway]
Nicole: Whoa, that was fast. [Noticing the Wattersons' car] Oh, look, there's our car up ahead.
Gumball: Pedal to the medal. [Goes forward to view Richard driving the car]
Darwin: Oh, look, it's Mister Dad.
[Gumball and Darwin laugh, as the computer shows several views of Richard noticing the camera, then pulling up his shirt out the window]
Nicole: Ah, I really wish he'd watch where he's—
[The final shot shows Richard chaotically driving off the road into the air, due to the presence of a construction site]
Nicole: Oh.
Gumball: Now I guess we know how he swallowed the steering wheel.
[Laughter occurs; the mouse clicks through a tunnel]
Nicole: Out of town we go.
[The screen ends up in the countryside, showing two cows merged together]
Darwin: [Laughs] Look at that glitch!
[The monitor then shows a cow wearing a distorted face]
Gumball: Yeah, and that one!
[The view reveals the cows are living near a nuclear power plant]
Nicole: Yeah, glitches. [Transitioning to the airport] Um, let's try somewhere else. Ooh! I'm so excited. I've never been on a plane.
[A view inside the airplane shows]
What's the view like?
[Leonard Daniels is shown sitting next to the view, wearing no pants and revealing his underwear]
Eh, maybe we should fly first-class next time. Where are we going anyway?
Gumball: [Selecting a destination] How about the Caribbean?
[The screen shows a beach on the Caribbean Islands; the trio gasps in delight]
Darwin: The beach!
Nicole: [Reading the sign] "Nudist beac"— Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Darwin: What's wrong, Mrs. Mom?
Nicole: Maybe we should go some place where we need clothes.
[The screen transitions to a cold, icy area]
Nicole: Oh, wow, I've never walked on ice before.
[As the camera moves forward, the ice cracks below. The trio whimpers]
Darwin: Go slowly. I don't think the ice can take our weight.
[Camera moves forward; ice cracks]
Darwin: Slower…
[Camera moves forward; ice cracks]
Darwin: Slower…
[The ice makes deeper cracks]
Darwin: Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster!
[The camera falls into the ice and swims through the ocean]
Nicole: Ooh, I've never been scuba diving either.
[An unknown fish appears, and their distance lessens]
Darwin: Wait, is that my fish mom?
[The fish turns around and eats the camera; they all scream]
Gumball: Oh, yeah, I can see the resemblance.
[They enter inside the fish]
All: Eww!
Nicole: Talk about fish breath.
[They travel further, ending up inside a mouth eating some food]
Gumball: Ah, all this travelling's made me hungry.
[The mouth, in which they are trapped, chews]
Nicole: Honey, I don't think you can—
[Gumball "chokes." The computer begins to select a different location]
Darwin: Quick! He's choking! Let's get him to a hospital!
[The camera is shown to be tended to by two hospital employees]
Gumball: Ah, I need some air. [Sighs, as the computer screen fades to black]
Darwin: Dude, stop leaning on the brightness button.
Gumball: Oh, sorry. [Restores brightness]
Nicole: Boys, I'm not getting to see much of the world here.
Gumball: Okay, let's go somewhere random. [Selects Tokyo as location] Ah, Tokyo. Now let's have a look around.
[They end up getting lost in a labyrinth-like building]
Maybe over there.
Nicole: Uh, Gumball, I don't think this is Tokyo.
Gumball: Th-This way, um…
Darwin: Gumball, can't you just admit we're lost?
Gumball: Nah, I just need to find a busy bit.
[They end up on a busy urban area in Tokyo, rushing through the road against opposite cars]
Nicole: I think this is a little too busy. How do we get out?
Gumball: Hold on. Uh, [Clicks to the upward direction] over there!
[The camera gets transferred to space]
All: Whoa!
[They are in space, facing away from Earth]
Nicole: Where are we?
Darwin: [Whispering] Turn us around.
[The camera faces toward Earth]
All: Wow.
Nicole: It really takes your breath away. [Struggling to breathe] Probably 'cause there's no oxygen.
Gumball: [Pointing towards the house] Get ready for the world's biggest sky dive. Three, two, one.
[As the arrow is clicked several times, the camera zooms in/decreases altitude on Earth, and they scream; when they end up back facing their house, they laugh. The screen zooms away from the computer and centers to the trio]
Gumball: [Pulling out the list] There, see the world— check.
Nicole: [Kisses both Gumball and Darwin on their cheeks] Thank you for that. Guess you're never too old to learn something new. [Pulls out another list] Here, I have something for you, too.
Gumball: What is it?
Nicole: The list of chores you agreed to.
[Gumball and Darwin grumble in frustration. The episode ends]
