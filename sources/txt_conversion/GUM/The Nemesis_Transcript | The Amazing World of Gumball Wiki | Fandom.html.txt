Walking Down the Street
[Gumball and Darwin are walking down the street]
Gumball: I don't see the point of this.
Darwin: What?
Gumball: Going for a Sunday walk, there's no payoff! It's like having superpowers but no nemesis to fight.
Darwin: Is walking a superpower?
Gumball: If having fun is your nemesis, then yes.
Darwin: Speaking of nemesis, what happened to that weird-looking guy who swore to be our mortal enemy?
Gumball: Yeah, he was all like, [Evil voice] "I will be your worst nightmare, I will be the terror of your existence, blah blah blah, threatening things, I WILL BE... YOUR ARCHENEMY." [Normally] Cut to: nothing happens.
[As Gumball and Darwin walk away, Rob appears behind them and puts a treadmill down. He takes out a car battery and attempts to slingshot it at them]
Gumball: I mean that's the problem with kids these days, [Just as the car battery is about to reach Darwin, it flings back and hits Rob in the head] they just don't commit to anything. You know who I blame? Overencouraging parents, medals for participation, and schools with no grades.
[Rob attempts to cut down a telephone pole. As Gumball and Darwin walk closer, he rapidly chops the telephone pole]
Gumball: And as soon as they fail, they just give up. We can't call them losers [Makes an adorable face] because they tried!
[Rob finishes chopping the pole, only for it to be suspended by the wires. He notices Gumball and Darwin, then jumps in a nearby bush]
Gumball: And you know what else I blame? College degrees in graphic design and like, mime. Heh, that's what the world needs. More street artists who can use Shotofop.
[Rob tries to launch the pole at Gumball and Darwin, but it hits a tree which falls right onto him. He tries to get up but the pole swings back and hits him in the face]
Gumball: I have two words for you: MILITARY KINDERGARTEN!
[Rob spills oil on the road and pushes a car down the slope. He cheers but slips]
Rob​​​​: AHHHHH!
Gumball: Something has to be done about it!
Darwin: Dude, chill out! Just breathe.
[Gumball and Darwin take a deep breath and close their eyes. The car takes them to the other side of the road while Rob slides off-screen]
Rob​​​​: AAAAHHHHH!
Gumball: So, no, we won't see our nemesis again. Probably got into a new fad like being a blogger, riding a penny board or whatever.
Rob​​​​: [Walks up to them] I'm trying, man, I'm trying to be your enemy!
Darwin: Oh, hi, good to see you!
Rob​​​​: It's not supposed to be good to see me!
Darwin: Aw, somebody needs a hug!
[Darwin tries to hug Rob, but he pushes him back, causing the oil to make Rob slide away]
Gumball: What was that?
Rob​​​​: It's the oil from the trap.
Darwin: What trap?
Rob​​​​: Just one of the five hundred and sixty-three traps I set for you guys! Like this one![Grabs a rope attached to a nearby tree hidden with leaves, then sighs] Look, I don't think I’m capable. Just forget about me. Like everyone else has.
[Rob starts walking but the oil makes him walk on the spot]
Rob​​​​: Would you mind?
[Darwin pushes Rob, who slowly slides away]
Darwin: Should we go...?
Gumball: Yeah, all right. [Starts walking away]
Darwin: No! I mean go after...
Gumball: Yeah, I know. I was just messing with ya.
Darwin: [Runs after Rob] Dude, come back!
Gumball: [Runs after Rob with Darwin, so his dialogue gets quieter] We'll help you become so evil that you'll grow a goatee!
[A bit later, the three of them are seen riding a bus]
In the Bus
Gumball: [Whispering] It's really sad that our nemesis rides the bus.
Rob​: I can hear you.
Gumball: Yeah, well, I hoped you'd be nutty enough to ride around on a bike made out of human bones, but here you are taking the bus. Not even as scary as that weird cat lady! [To Alison] No offense.
Alison: Don't listen to them, Martin, I know you're a real boy.
[Martin meows angrily and scratches Alison's face]
Darwin: Maybe he would look more evil if he had an ominous theme tune.
Gumball: Dude, what's your name?
Rob​: Rob.
Gumball and Darwin: [Singing] Bob bob. Bada ba bob. Bob bob bob bob bob bob bob bob, bob bob bob bob bob bob bob bob, BADA BOB!
Rob​​​​​​​​: It's Rob!
Gumball and Darwin: [Singing] Rob rob rob rob rob rob...
[Rob shakes his head and covers his face with his hands]
Alison: I would have gone for something more like: [singing] Robitous! Ominous! On the bus! Robitous ominous on the bus!
Marvin: No, what about: [Imitates a theremin] Rooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooob!
Sussie: Eh, what about: [Does little noises then one single loud bass beat] ROB!
[Everyone on the bus continues making noises, much to Rob's chagrin. The bus stops at the parking lot of the mall]
[Rob leaves the bus in a huff]
Gumball: Rob! Dude, Rob! Rob! Rob, come back! Rob! [He and Darwin follow Rob into the mall]
In the Mall
[Cut to inside the mall, where Rob is seen sniffing some melons. Gumball gasps]
Gumball: That's it! That's what he’s missing!
Darwin: Melons?
Gumball: No, he needs a villainous name like, "Dr. something."
Darwin: Dr. Fruity?
Gumball: Meh.
Darwin: Dr. Dandruff?
Gumball: Dr. Ethically-sourced-tuna-fish!
Darwin: Dr. Jerky!
Gumball: Dr. Moisturizer!
Darwin: Dr. Old-man-reaching-for-a-jar-of-olives?
Old man: Yes?
Darwin: Never mind...
[Gumball and Darwin follow Rob out of the market]
Gumball: Come on, man, give us something to work with.
Darwin: How about Dr. Fuzz?
Gumball: Yeah, or Dr. [Imitates static]
Darwin: It’s more like Dr. [Imitates static]
[Gumball and Darwin keep making noises resembling static until Rob throws his groceries on the ground and starts screaming, stomping on them. Gumball then takes a really deep breath, and Rob stops freaking out, looking worried for him]
Rob​​​​​​​​: Are you ok?
Gumball: [Strained] Just having a eureka moment. What about...
[Gumball suddently looks like a superhero comic character with glowing eyes, as lightning strikes behind him]
Gumball: [Evil voice] DR. WRECKER!
Rob​​​​​​​​: I...! I... I like it. [In a squeaky voice] Dr. Wrecker!
Gumball: We're gonna have to work on the voice.
Making a Nemesis
[Cut to the Wattersons' house. Gumball, Darwin and Rob are in the living room]
Gumball: Okay, try the British accent again.
Rob​​​​​​​​: [Slightly high-pitched, rolling 'r's] I will destroy ye and everyone ye love.
Gumball: Eh, sounds like a cat being strangled by another cat who's also being strangled. Underwater. Okay, hold on. [Grabs a remote and aims it at Rob, going through different menus] No, no, color, no... Sharpness? No... Subtitles, nah... Ah, there! [Changes language to "English"] Try again.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [High-pitched, feminine] I will destroy you and everyone you love.
Gumball: Hold on, I need to adjust the bass. [Presses a button on the remote] Okay, again.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [High-pitched and feminine, so loud the house shakes] I will destroy you-
Gumball: Sorry, sorry! That was the volume! Okay. [Presses another button] Again?
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [In a deep voice] I will destroy you and everyone you love!
[Gumball and Darwin gasp in admiration and Rob looks at them happily]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: I am Dr. Wrecker, kneel before Dr. Wrecker, Dr. Wrecker is-
Gumball: [Mutes Rob] Okay, calm down. Next we need to get you an outfit.
[A sequence shows different pieces of armor appearing on Rob. It is interrupted by Gumball throwing a cardboard helmet at Rob, who is standing on the chair in Gumball and Darwin's room]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Ow! This is ridiculous, why do I have to get dressed like this?
Gumball: Because you don't see villains spending ten minutes hopping on one foot, pushing their leg through their armored pants! Come on, lower your head. [Throws helmet again, knocking Rob off the chair] Maybe you just put the helmet on yourself.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Puts on helmet] I am Dr. Wrecker! [Weak laughing] No, that's not right. Ha, ha, ha! No no no, still not right. Ha ha ha ha! No, that's not good.
Darwin: Our evil baby's almost ready to go out into the big, wide world.
Gumball: And destroy it.
Darwin: This calls for a celebration! [Gumball and Darwin crawl out of the room]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Ah ha ha! [Goes downstairs] Ha ha ha! How did that sound? Guys? Guys! Hello?
[Rob finds Gumball and Darwin, looking hunched and with yellow and creepy eyes.]
Darwin and Gumball: [Blow party horns] Happy evil day, master!
[The room is decorated with birthday supplies with skulls drawn over them and a "HAPPY EVIL DAY" banner. Rob takes a Daisy the Donkey paper plate with eyebrows, red eyes, and sharp teeth drawn on the face]
Gumball: [In evil voice] I'm sorry, master. It was kind of hard to buy evil stuff online without ticking a box saying I was eighteen, so we had to improvise.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: What is all this?
Darwin: [In evil voice] We've had so much fun, we'd rather be your minions than your enemies. A cookie for the master? [Hands a plate of skull-shaped cookies to Rob]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: You think this is a game? You think that because you helped me find myself, I'm no longer your enemy? You think we’re friends? I am Dr. Wrecker and before long, you will be wreck-tified!
Darwin: [In normal voice] What does that mean?
Gumball: [In normal voice] Doesn't really make sense.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Yes, I'm not 100% on the catchphrase yet. But this is what I do to your friendship! [Throws the cookie plate on the floor and stomps on it]
Darwin: [Tears up]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Mark my words: I will destroy you and everyone you love! [Slams the front door as he leaves]
Gumball: Who would’ve thought in creating a monster, we'd create a monster?
Wrecking Elmore
[At nighttime, Gumball is trying to comfort Darwin when the doorbell rings. They open the door]
Gumball: Oh, our little "friend" has come back to play.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: I'm afraid it has become a little more serious than that. I set in process a series of events so magnificent in their conception that it will destroy-
Gumball: Wreck.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: -that it will wreck the whole of Elmore and everyone in it, but mostly you. And where better to wreak maximum damage than the Elmore dam?
[A flashback shows Rob sneaking into a closed area, where a sign reads "Elmore Dam"]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Voice-over] I knew if I wrecked the control room, the whole town would flood.
[Rob knocks on a metal door in the flashback]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Voice-over] A door like this would present a problem to a mere mortal but not to Dr. Wrecker and his wrecking ball! [Rides a wrecking ball in the flashback]
[The flashback stops]
Gumball: [Voice-over] Wait, you hired a wrecking ball?
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Voice-over] You bet!
[The flashback restarts. Rob smashes the wrecking ball into the wall beside the door, breaking it. He stands up]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: You just got wrecked!
[The broken wall reveals a control panel with electricity and water coming out of it. The flashback stops]
Gumball: Stylish entrance, check. Global threat, check. Use of improved catchphrase, "you just got wrecked," check. The final category is getting away in style.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Ah, well, I was going to escape by bus.
[Flashback shows Rob waiting at a bus stop]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Whispering to himself] I'm Dr. Wrecker, no no, you just got wrecked. I'm Dr. Wrecker -
[Flashback fast-forwards from evening to night]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Voice-over] Then I realized it's Sunday, and the buses stop early on a Sunday.
[The flashback ends]
Darwin: So, you need our help.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Yes.
Darwin: [Sulks]
Gumball: [Whispering] You never apologized for wrecking his cookies.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Did I mention the whole town is about to be wrecked? Because who cares about your cookies?!
Darwin: It was more than cookies! You wrecked my feelings, young man!
Gumball: It's one thing being a nemesis, it's another thing entirely being a bully!
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Oh, for the love of- I'm sorry.
Gumball: [Whispering] I think if you were really sorry, you'd give him a hug.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Are you kidding?! Ah. [Hugs Darwin]
Darwin: Mmm... Okay, I forgive you.
Gumball: Then let's save the town!
[Rob 'runs' while heroic music plays, but it is quickly revealed he is sitting in a desk chair pushed by Gumball and Darwin]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Thanks, guys, you know this outfit pinches when I run.
[Eventually, Gumball, Darwin and Rob make it to the closed area. Electricity sparks out of a control panel exposed by a hole in the wall]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Fix it, minions!
Gumball: What do you mean "fix it?" It's ruined.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Tuts and wags his finger] Wrecked.
Darwin: Okay, okay, there should be a blue, a red, and a yellow wire.
Gumball: Uh-uh.
Darwin: Cut the yellow wire.
Gumball: Okay. [Prepares to cut the wire with his fingers]
Darwin: No no no, wait!
Gumball: What?
Darwin: I have no credentials or diploma. It would be criminally stupid to listen to me.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Hurry up, there's only thirty seconds left. [Looks at watch] I mean twenty-nine. I mean twenty-eight. I mean twenty-seven. I mean twenty-six. I mean - we don't have time to lose! Twenty seconds.
[As Rob counts down, Gumball's hand gets closer and closer to the wires]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Seventeen. Fifteen. Fourteen. Thirteen. Twelve. Eleven. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four.
Gumball: I'm sorry, guys, I really don't feel like touching live electrical wires with my bare hands.
[The control panel starts beeping]
Darwin: The dam is gonna burst!
Gumball: This is where it ends!
Darwin: [Hugs Gumball] Then it's important you know: I love you.
Gumball: [Hugs Darwin] And it's important that you know: I really love you.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Gets between them] And it's important that you know: I really, really, really, hate you. [Checks watch] And now, we only have three, two, one...
[They huddle together, bracing themselves for the explosion. A can of soda is ejected and hits Gumball's head]
Gumball: Ow.
Darwin: Eh, I was expecting something more visually interesting.
[Gumball looks over the wall. They were standing right behind a vending machine. Gumball removes the junk in front of the sign]
Gumball: "Elmore auto damage repair center?"
Darwin: Does Elmore even have a dam?
Gumball: No.
[Silence]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Well, this is awkward.
Darwin: Should we just leave?
Gumball: Yes, let's go.
A Failed Nemesis
[On the way home, Rob throws his armor behind, looking depressed]
Gumball: Come on, man, there will be other opportunities to destroy us.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Sighs] What's the point?
[As they walk down the street, Gumball and Darwin notice the snare trap from earlier. They decide to walk right into it]
Darwin: [Stilted] Oh, no! We got caught by Dr. Wrecker's trap!
Gumball: [Stilted] He will probably leave us to hang here until our heads explode as he does his trademark evil laugh.
[A confused Rob looks at Gumball, who smiles and gestures to him]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Laughs evilly] You just got wrecked!
Gumball: Good job, buddy. Now, do you mind getting us down?
Rob​​​​​​​: [Walks away laughing]
Gumball: Dude? Seriously? Please, Bob- I mean, Dr. Wrecker. Please come back!
