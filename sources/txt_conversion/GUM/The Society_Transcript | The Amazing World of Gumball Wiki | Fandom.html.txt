A Headshot
[In the Elmore theatre, students are auditioning for roles in a play, dressed in costumes.]
Teri: Four score and seven years ago, plus some more years, I was the first American president to have a beard.
Alan​: They carved my face in the side of a mountain!
Anton: I'm not a crook!
[Gumball is shown, dressed in a robin hood costume.]
Gumball: [Deep gruff voice] I steal from the rich, and give to the poor!
Mister Small​: No, no, no! That's all wrong!
Gumball: Oh, come on, Mr. Small! This play needs more action. I mean, what do you think an audience would rather watch: a load of people going– [Gumball speaks gibberish.] or me going–"IT BELONGS IN A MUSEUM!"
[Gumball whips out his belt, pretends to swing, and then shoot things.]
Gumball: That's my secret, I'm always angry! [Growls]
[Gumball becomes the Hulk, and his other acts make Mr. Small facepalm. He yells out familiar phrases from characters such as Ryu/Ken, Harry Potter, Liu Kang and then the announcer from Mortal Kombat, etc.]
Gumball: Shoryuken! Expecto patronum!
[Gumball eventually settles down with a bicycle kick.]
Gumball: Gumball wins, fatality. [Normal voice] And then, I kiss the girl. [Pretends to kiss an invisible girl.] No? Aw, come on, this play stinks! I mean, Darwin doesn't even have a role.
[Darwin is seen offstage.]
Darwin: Sure, I do. If I don't flip this switch, nobody will be able to see the play!
Gumball: Dude, you know when people say "I could do that job with my little finger"? In your case, it's actually true.
Darwin: [Looking like he's about to cry] But, I only have one finger...
Mister Small​​​​​​​​: Gumball, if you wanna be involved in the play, just audition properly like everyone else.
Gumball: I'm a serious actor. I don't audition.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​: Fine. Just leave me your headshot, [Holds up a bunch of pictures with Tobias' headshot shown.] and go.
Gumball: [Deep gruff voice again] Oh, so you want a headshot? How's this for a headshot?
[With his toy bow and arrow, Gumball aims and fires at the bunch of headshot pictures that Mr. Small is carrying. Instead, he scores a direct hit on Mr. Small's forehead. The non-lethal arrow is left stuck to his head.]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​: Ow. [Screams while falling to the ground dramatically.]
Gumball: I am so sorry. I–I was aiming at the headshot, I–I didn't mean it–oh, w–w–wait. I know how to fix this. [Opens arms like a clapboard] End… scene…
[Mr. Small calms down, then continues to scream.]
Three Months' Detention
[Gumball waits on a bench outside the principal's office.]
Nigel Brown: [Heard from behind the door] You be more careful, next time.
[The door opens, and Banana Joe walks out from the office.]
Nigel Brown: Watterson...
[Gumball walks into the office.]
Nigel Brown: You're in detention for the rest of the month.
Gumball: What?! Banana Joe just got a slap on the wrist for what he did!
Nigel Brown: Banana Joe was running through the hall. You shot an arrow into a teacher's head.
Gumball: Okay, you're making it sound bad. But, it was just an accident! Here, l–lemme show you.
[Gumball sits at the principal's desk, and starts using the objects on it for his demonstration.]
Gumball: So, let's say the desk was the stage, and I'm the coffee cup, and Mr. Small was the gross portrait of Miss Simian.
[Gumball posts some sticky notes on Miss Simian's mouth, and plays with a rubber band and paper clips.]
Gumball: He was holding this bunch headshots which will be sticky notes here, and I had my bow and arrow like this elastic band and paperclip–-
[Gumball inadvertently shoots the paper clip through Brown's glasses, and into one of his eyes. The principal falls down a window. Another paperclip bounces into a socket, and this causes a small explosion. The sprinkler system and fire alarm are activated.]
Nigel Brown: [From outside] Let's make it three months' detention!
At the Schoolyard
Gumball: Dude, I swear. Sometimes, I think the whole world is against me.
[Gumball inserts a coin into a vending machine. When his bag of chips gets stuck, he repeatedly points at the chips and gestures to Darwin to emphasize his point.]
Darwin: I don't know. Sometimes it feels like maybe, its kinda because you're a little uh-–
Gumball: Mistreated?
Darwin: A little...
Gumball: Cheated out of things I deserved?
Darwin: Eh–-
Gumball: Unjustifiably shunned?
Darwin: I was kind of going more for a weeping sore of annoyance.
[Gumball turns around, and sees Tobias about to buy from the vending machine.]
Gumball: Hey! [Intimidating voice] Back off! They're my chips!
[Gumball thrashes the vending machine like an insane person. When his chips finally come out, Gumball takes them, and glares at Tobias as he eats them. A frightened Tobias inserts a coin, and all the snacks come out of the vending machine. He snatches them all, and delightedly runs away laughing.]
Gumball: [Inhales] Ugh. [Gasps, quietly] Dude, I think I just understood why things never go my way.
Darwin: [Sighs] Finally.
Gumball: There's a secret society at school.
Darwin: I'm sorry. What?
Gumball: Dude, think about it: I didn't get into the school play, but some people did; Joe got away with murder, when I got punished for almost nothing; and now, this! I thought for a second it might be my fault. But, the evidence is overwhelming! There is a secret society in this school, a corrupt circuit promoting inequality; a disgusting organization encouraging injustice and elitism–and I want in!
At the Hallway
[Gumball and Darwin walk through a school hallway.]
Gumball: [Warily] Look around. They're everywhere.
Darwin: What? Lockers?
Gumball: No. Their secret signs. Signs you see on doors, doors you can never open... [Gumball points, and knocks down Darwin simultaneously, by accident.] SEE?!
[Gumball points at a door with the handicap symbol. Darwin gets up, looks, and slaps Gumball's arm.]
Darwin: No!
Gumball: Fair enough. Let's try secret handshakes first.
Darwin: Secret handshake?
[The bell rings, and Principal Brown emerges from the school infirmary.]
Gumball: Principal Brown, I just wanted to say sorry. I hope we can come to a new understanding.
Nigel Brown: …M'kay.
[Principal Brown takes Gumball's outstretched hand, and shakes it. Then Gumball scratches his wrist with his index finger. As the principal watches in wonder, Gumball starts to play with his hand. He first taps Brown's hand with his fingers, twists and sweeps palms, high-fives, and laces fingers. Then, with his individual fingers, he scratches in between. Gumball proceeds by energetically shuffling his fingers under the disturbed principal's hand, pulling each finger, then shaking hands again. He ends with an uncomfortable body position.]
Gumball: No?
[The Principal quickly pulls back his hand.]
Nigel Brown: I… think I need to wash my hand.
Gumball: Allow me to help.
[Gumball activates the fire alarm and sprinkler system.]
In the Library
[Gumball runs a hand through some books in a shelf. He inspects one of them.]
Darwin: Dude, if there was a secret society, they wouldn't write a book about it.
Gumball: [Laughs] We're not here to read, my naive friend. We're here to open the door to their secret lair.
Darwin: [Disinterested] Sure.
Gumball: Or, is it!?
[Gumball pulls a book, and nothing happens.]
Gumball: No, wait. That didn't come out right. Can you say something like: [mocks Darwin] "there is no secret passage, detective Watterson. This is ridiculous!", [normally] and then I go "or, is it?"–
Darwin: CAN YOU JUST– pull the book?
Gumball: [Quietly] Or, is it?
[Gumball pulls out a book, and gives it to Darwin.]
Gumball: Now, all I have to do is rotate this shelf.
[Gumball pushes the bookshelf, and causes other shelves behind to fall down and squish people, including Sarah. Some of Sarah gets on Darwin's face, and he wipes his face.]
Darwin: Okay, this is probably the moment to not do whatever it is you were going to do next.
Gumball: Or, is it?!
[Gumball pulls down a wall lamp like a lever, and breaks it.]
Gumball: Hm.
[Gumball knocks on the wooden portion of the wall, and stops at a spot.]
Gumball: Ah. It's gotta be here. [Gasps] Here!
[He punches through the wall, and opens up the spot, revealing a pipe.]
Gumball: A secret lever!
[Gumball breaks it, and is splashed down with a stream of water. He coughs, and sees a crowd of angry people in the library.]
Gumball: Oh. [Chuckles] Here's the door I was looking for.
[He runs towards the door, followed by Darwin. Moments after he exits, Gumball pops his head through a vent.]
Gumball: Aha! Oh, sorry.
At the Hallway Again
Gumball: Maybe we just need to know the secret password to open the door.
Darwin: That makes about as much sense as much as everything else you said today.
[Gumball sees Rocky mopping the floor.]
Gumball: Rocky! He knows every inch of the school! He's got to be part of the society.
[Gumball slides towards Rocky, and grabs him by the shirt.]
Gumball: TELL US WHAT IT IS!
Rocky: [Grabs Gumball by the collar.] TELL YOU WHAT IS WHAT?!
Gumball: [Grabs Rocky by the shirt.] THE SECRET PASSWORD!
Rocky: Oh, sure, no need to shout. My ATM number is zero-three-eighty, my email password is "rockyroxxxx" with four "X"s, and my Elmore Plus is "unbreakable."
Gumball: Right. What is it, though?
Rocky: "Unbreakable."
Gumball: [Sighs] I need the secret password. [Pulls out twenty dollars.] Here, here's twenty dollars.
Rocky: Uh, I don't know what you're talking about here, but I can't be bought.
[Gumball forces Rocky to have his money, and tries to shove it into his pockets.]
Gumball: Nah, come on, Rocky. Just take it! Just take the mon–-
[Rocky yelps, and Gumball accidentally rips Rocky's pants off.]
Rocky: I'M NOT FOR SALE! [Cries and runs away] THIS IS WHY I QUIT BANKING!
Darwin: Gumball, you're beginning to seriously upset people.
Gumball: You'll thank me when we're playing racquetball with the president.
Blending with Tobias
[The school bell rings again, and Tobias is seen walking in the hall. Unknown to him, Gumball is hiding behind him, with his feet in Tobias' shoes. Tobias looks around and suspects something, then shrugs and continues walking. At P.E., Tobias has a hard time doing pushups and pull-ups. He weighs himself in the locker room, and is shocked to see his weight at a whopping 180 pounds. He frowns, squeezes his belly, and scratches his head with Gumball's arm. Later, he plods up to his locker sweating and panting.]
Darwin: [To Gumball] Dude, seriously? Come on.
Tobias​​: I'm sorry, man. I just feel really slow and heavy.
Gumball: [Whispers to Darwin] He's gonna lead us straight to them.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: I'm losing my mind! I'm hearing voices, and I'm sweating like a pig!
Gumball: Here. [Hands Tobias body spray]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: Thanks. [Sprays himself and Gumball] Wait! It was you all along?!
[Gumball sneezes, and knocks Tobias out cold.]
Darwin: I think I know why things don't go your way. You never know when to quit.
Gumball: You're right. I always give up too soon!
[Darwin facepalms as Gumball walks away, dragging Tobias with him.]
Getting People Annoyed
Sarah: ...And made Juke come into the girl's bathroom to record our conversation!
Leslie​​​​​​​: He tried to bug me with actual bugs!
[Gumball crawls quietly to Leslie, and raises up his pot. Leslie's nakedness surprises Sarah, and Gumball slides away. Leslie quickly puts his pot on.]
Leslie​​​​​​​: [Chuckles] I wish I'd worn my underpot.
[He slithers over to Idaho and Banana Joe next.]
Idaho: I heard he went through the Coach's pockets. She don't even have pockets!
[Gumball pulls up Banana Joe's back peel. Joe gasps, sees Gumball, slaps him, and walks away. Idaho also slaps Gumball, and follows after Joe. Gumball proceeds to check on Miss Simian next. As he slides to her, upset people watch him from a window.]
Tobias​​​​​​​: What is he doing?
Darwin: [Sighs] He's checking for membership tattoos.
[The sound of cloth flapping is heard, followed by Miss Simian's screams.]
Darwin: He thinks he's a failure because he's not a member of some secret society at school.
Banana Joe: There's a secret society at school?!
Darwin: If there was, at least he'd stop harassing everyone.
Nigel Brown: The only way to stop him is to give him what he wants.
Darwin: What? No! Has that ever stopped anyone? You'll just fuel his madness!
Lucy Simian: [Runs to them] Whatever it takes to stop that kid, we're doing it right now!
The Secret Society
[Gumball and Darwin enter the dark gym. Gumball is holding a note, while Darwin walks alongside him, uninterested.]
Gumball: Okay. An unanimous note from Banana Joe said "meet here after school".
Darwin: [Sighs]
[As soon as the doors close, the lights turn on, gradually revealing students and teachers "disguised" with boxes painted with eyes over their heads. The "members" of the "society" face Gumball, and their "leader," Banana Joe is seen, wearing a sock.]
Banana Joe: Welcome to the super secret powerful big secret powerful society meeting [Unsure] initiation… time.
Secret Society Members: Super secret powerful big secret powerful society meeting initiation time.
[Gumball smiles, while Darwin sighs.]
Darwin: Are you serious? Boxes on heads? Come on, Gumball. Let's get out of here.
Gumball: Dude, this is our only chance!
Darwin: Ugh, this is ridiculous! And no amount of sweet talking would change my mind.
Gumball: But, if you don't get into the secret society too, I'll have to hang out with all these new bros, but not the bro I love the most.
[Darwin's frown is transformed into a smile.]
Darwin: All right, then!
Banana Joe: Approach, underling.
[Gumball and Darwin walk to Joe.]
Gumball: Uh–good a–good after–evening, grand lord–warlock.
[Gumball curtsies, then stretches his shirt like a skirt.]
Darwin: What was that about?
Gumball: No idea.
Banana Joe: So, you have found our secret society, which we keep secret… from society. To join us, you must face two tri–
Teri: [whispering to Joe] Three trials.
Banana Joe: Three trials. The first is the flogging of the novice. Bring out the ceremonial pillows! [Claps]
[The members bring out trays with pillows on pillows.]
Darwin: What kind of society presents a pillow on a pillow?
Gumball: [Bows] Yes, I beg you, grand vizier, I do not need special treatment. I would go all the way. I'll do anything, like drink bat's blood, dance with flaming swords, touch the gross metal part of the water fountain with my cheek. You know, hard core stuff.
Banana Joe: [Whispers] Sorry, man. But, if he doesn't get what he wants, we'll have to suffer for the rest of the week.
Darwin: You are not gonna beat him up!
Gumball: Then I'll do it myself!
[Gumball grabs a metal tray, and beats his face repeatedly. His face slowly becomes more bruised.]
Gumball: Still standing! Still standing. Stang standung… [Groans]
Mister Small​​​​​​​: Please, stop! You have proven yourself.
[A stream of tears comes out of Gumball's black eye.]
Mister Small​​​​​​​: What an amazing warrior spirit. How does he stay standing?
[Gumball's head literally shatters.]
Mister Small​​​​​​​: Oh, well that makes more sense.
Banana Joe: Your second trial will be the besmirching of the rival! You must mock our enemy, Richwood High, by roasting them!
Gumball: No problem, grand llama! I'll follow your orders to the letter! [Runs off]
Darwin: You should have been more specific… should have been more specific… should have been more specific...
Banana Joe: What? I meant "roasted", like make fun of them.
Darwin: You should have been more specific!
[The sound of the door opening is heard.]
Gumball: Mission accomplished!
[Everyone turns to him, and screams.]
Darwin: What has he done? What has he done!? [Screams]
[Gumball drags a roasted pig mascot with Carlton inside.]
Gumball: What? I roasted their school mascot, like you said.
Carlton: [Hurt] He said very hurtful things about my cheering skills, and he painted my costume to make it look roasted in a ruthless display of irony. [Cries]
[Everyone exhales with relief. The scene changes to them outside, at the school's roof.]
Banana Joe: Here we are for your final trial: the leap of faith! Jump, and you will join us.
[Banana Joe motions to a blind Gumball and Darwin to the ground in from of them, covered with pillows. However, Gumball leans backwards, to the unprotected direction leading to a several story fall.]
Gumball: Yes, grand kahuna.
Banana Joe: Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Gumball: What?
Banana Joe: That's the wrong way.
Gumball: No, it's not. Your voice is coming from right in front of me, so it's obvious I gotta jump backwards. [Proceeds to jump]
Banana Joe: Uh, wait!
Gumball: Ugh, now what?
[Darwin takes off his blindfold.]
Darwin: [Whispering] What are we doing on a vacated roof?!
Banana Joe: I thought the wind would make it more authentic. It's perfectly safe, he's supposed to jump forward.
Darwin: How is this safe!? Tell him the truth, right now!
Banana Joe: [Sighs] Gumball... it's–it's all fake.
[Banana Joe, and the others take off their masks.]
Gumball: What do you mean?
Banana Joe: They made it all up.
Gumball: [Uncovers his eyes, and gasps.] Banana Joe!? You were the grand master, all this time?
Banana Joe: Dude, I clearly look like a banana wearing a sock. I'm sorry. We all pretended so you'd stop behaving like a nutburger.
[Banana Joe and the rest leave Gumball and Darwin.]
Gumball: [Sighs] I think I finally understand.
Darwin: I know it hurt. But, it's probably for the best.
Gumball: They double-bluffed me!
Darwin: What?!
Gumball: They pretended there was no secret society to cover up the real one.
Darwin: Are you seriously telling me you learned nothing today?
Gumball: Well, I did learn one thing: I learned that I don't need any stupid secret society… 'cause I got you, dude. [Punches Darwin playfully]
​Darwin: [Wincing] Oh you clod! [Smiles at Gumball's remark]​​​​​​​
