Dash for the Cupcakes
[From the opposite side of the backyard, Gumball and Darwin zero in on some cupcakes on a table; while they run to them, Gumball snags himself on a line, and accidentally pops a balloon, setting of a chain reaction of balloons popping around him and Darwin; the balloons pop like gunfire, and one takes him down; Darwin is taken down afterwards; Gumball regains consciousness, his ears ring]
Gumball: [Muffled] Darwin! You okay?
[Still with balloons popping like gunshots, Gumball drags Darwin and takes cover behind a chair]
Gumball: Come on, buddy. We're almost there!
[An eagle squawks, and Anais slams open the shed's door, soda bottle in hand]
Anais: Not so fast, boys! [Holds up mint] I drop this non-branded mint into this unbranded cola, it'll give me enough firepower to blast you through that darn fence.
Gumball: What'cha gonna do with all that cupcake? There's only one of you, and there`s two of us!
Anais: They're for my friends only! I don't want you there, eat'n everything and weird'n them out. Just give up, and that'll be the end of it. [Raises mint] Otherwise-
Gumball: Okay okay! Wait.
[Gumball and Darwin raise their hands]
Gumball: We surrender. [Points somewhere] Oh look! Your friends are here!
Anais: [Gasps] Really?!
[Gumball and Darwin are seen gobbling up all the cupcakes; suddenly they stop, twitch, and make gruesome faces]
Gumball: [Holding out lemon with powder on it; disgusted] These aren't cupcakes, they're lemons, and the icing is baking soda-
[Their mouths and eyes explode with foam]
Anais: [Sinisterly] The real stuff is in the shed.
[She drops the mint, and shoots her brothers away with a powerful blast of soda]
Making a Friend
[Cuts to the duo crossing their arms, unhappy on the couch]
Richard: I know, and my decoy cupcakes were made out of toilet paper. But I kept eating anyway! [Plunges mouth with plunger]
Nicole: You two need to learn to give your sister more space. [A bubble growing from her mouth pops; sad] Mine were made from soap.
[Gumball and Darwin go back to the backyard]
Gumball: [Quietly] Okay. We'll just blend in with the crowd, and then go straight for the cupcakes.
[They both put on pompous expressions, pretend to be part of the "crowd," and walk discreetly to the cupcakes.]
Gumball: [Snootily]:  Hey Mel!
Darwin: [Snootily]: Hi!
Gumball: Always great to see you. [Turns to invisible person] Hey Barbara!
Darwin: [Turns] Hi!
Gumball: [Kisses invisible person's cheeks] Looking good. [Aside to Darwin] She had a lot of work done. Jeff my man! [Laughs] Sorry to hear you broke up with Karen. Karen! Love the dress. [Whispers] Call me.
[At the table, they immediately gobble up the cupcakes once again]
Gumball: [With mouth full] Wait, where is everyone?
Anais: [Sad] I don't know! I prepared everything, and no one came!
Darwin: Did you invite anyone?
Anais: Of course not, I have no friends.
Gumball and Darwin: Hmm.
Anais: [Shrugs]
Gumball: [Sighs] You know, you're really clever but… sometimes you're kind of an awkward sausage.
Darwin: You need friends to have a party.
Anais: But the whole point of this party was to make friends.
Gumball and Darwin: Hmm…
Gumball: Hey, how 'bout we make one up for you...
Darwin: Like an imaginary friend?!
Anais: [Sniffs] Okay.
Gumball: Come on! think hard!
[He and Darwin think so hard their eyes pop out]
Gumball: Come on. You, too.
Darwin: Close your eyes and imagine!
[Anais sighs and joins them in imagining a friend. Then the chimera appears, and they see it and stop imagining]
Darwin: Shouldn't we be screaming?
Anais: I was kind of waiting for you.
Gumball: Let's do it on three, two, one.
[They inhale]
Gumball: Nah, I think the moment's passed. [Walks up to chimera] Why does he look like that?
Anais: I guess because we imagined him all together. I didn't think he'd be so… real.
Gumball: Can it speak? [To chimera] Hello!
Anais: Did we really make you up?
Chimera: Uh… yeah.
Gumball: [Excited] If we can imagine him into life, we can imagine anything!
Darwin and Anais: Yeah!
Darwin: We can imagine money and give it to the poor!
Anais: We could imagine an extinct species and bring it back to life!
Gumball: We could imagine I never got caught by mom using her hair-removal cream on my butt! Or we could imagine I never said that.
[They nod, and imagine for a while again]
Gumball: Okay! [To chimera] Hi! Nice to meet you! High five!
[The chimera doesn't move, and Gumball motions to his upraised hand; the chimera nudges it with his nose, and scares Gumball]
Gumball: Right. Well, Anais, looks like we found someone as socially awkward as you.
Anais: Ah! [Raises hands up in joy]
Darwin: Why don't you guys try and be friends? [Pushes Anais to chimera] Go on.
[Anais stands afraid in front of the chimera]
Gumball: Come on guys, make an effort. Make eye contact. Come on. Come on!
[Gumball grabs Anais' head, and tries to aim her eyes at the chimera's]
Gumball: I said eye contact with him!
[Their eyes stretch, and literally make contact]
Gumball: Hm. That'll have to do. Now let's try a smile. Like this.
[Gumball and Darwin smile really wide; Anais copies them, and the chimera smiles back awkwardly; they continue smiling at each other]
Darwin: [Quietly] More teeth! We need more teeth!
[The chimera smiles to the point of almost baring his teeth, and Anais gives a full-toothed smile]
Darwin: Uh… good?
Gumball: [Aside to Darwin] If you wanna make friends with straitjacket. [Aloud] Let's move on to making small talk. Demonstration!
[Cut to the brothers picking food at the table, while Anais and the chimera watch]
Gumball: Oh hi. Oh, I love your hair! What's your secret?
Darwin: Male-pattern hair loss with a sprinkle of stress. So, who do you know here?
Gumball: Oh, I'm Anais' brother.
Darwin: Really? Me, too! [Quietly] She's so weird-looking, right?
Gumball: [Quietly] Yeah. She's like a garden gnome who got her head transplanted from an Easter island statue.
Gumball and Darwin: [Laughs]
Gumball: We both like to have fun at the detriment of others!
Gumball and Darwin: [Dancing] We should totally be friends!
Darwin: Alright, your turn.
Anais: Uh.
Chimera: Uh…
Gumball: Come on. Say something.
Chimera: Uh. I like... hair?
[Gumball sighs in disbelief]
Anais: Uh, here. [Rips off Gumball's hair] Have some!
[Gumball winces, and the chimera eats his hair]
Anais: [Nervously] Hm. Yeah.
Chimera: Oh uh… you have some hair too.
[He tries to pull out some of his, but ends up pulling his head out]
Chimera: Oh uh… [Offers head] here. [Drops head]
Gumball: I'm pretty sure that's not how you make friends. Put it back on.
Chimera: [Puts head back]
Gumball: Okay, you weirdos just say hi, and shake hands.
Anais: Hello.
Chimera: Hi.
[Anais shakes his hand, then his hand falls off]
Chimera: Oh man! I'm so sorry.
Anais: No no, wait!
[His hand hides behind his leg, then peeks]
Anais: Don't worry. It's okay.
[The chimera smiles, and tickles Anais with his detached hand]
Anais: [Laughs] Stop, it tickles!
Gumball: It's hard to know how to feel about this. On one hand it's "awwww." But n the other hand, it's [Retches]
Anais: It doesn't matter. I made a friend.
Darwin: Which means it's time to PARTY!
A Criminal?
[Inside the house, Nicole and Richard watch some news; the kids are heard cheering in the background]
News Anchor (TV): Elmore residents are reporting a series of break-ins across the neighborhood with-
Richard: Hey kids! You alright?
Anais: Yeah! We're just playing with our imaginary friend.
Richard: Well, you better leave me some cupcakes.
Anais: Don't worry, he only eats hair.
Richard: Well you better leave me some of that too. I've been saving a space in my stomach right here. [Pushes spot on tummy, submarine sandwich comes out] [Pushes back sandwich] I mean right here. [Pushes tummy, whole chicken comes out] [Pushes back chicken] I mean- oh, you know what I mean.
Nicole: Sh! This looks important.
News Anchor (TV): …who is said to be over seven feet tall.
[Scene cuts back to the backyard.]
Anais: Now just hold still. [Blindfolds chimera] Good. Okay, and go!
[With just a tap, the chimera unintentionally sends their piñata flying up into the sky until it becomes a star in the sky and disappears.]
Chimera: Hm? [Takes off blindfold] Aw sorry.
Gumball: Nah, it's okay. No harm dooo-
[His hand is missing, and he screams; everyone else screams until Gumball reveals his hand hidden by his long sleeves; everyone sighs in relief, then Gumball hides his hand again and screams; Everyone screams for fun this time, and laughs after Gumball reveals his hand again]
Anais: Come on. Let's go inside and make another piñata. I'm sure the last one made some kids in the south pole very happy.
[Scene cuts back to Nicole and Richard]
News Anchor (TV): And now an update on the terrifying intruder who is breaking in to Elmore homes. Here is a police sketch based on eyewitness reports.
Nicole: Um, guys, I think it would be better if you played inside today. There's a-
[Nicole sees her kids with the chimera; she looks back to the TV, and sees that the chimera is the intruder; everyone gasps and holds their faces with Richard pushing back a pizza coming out of his mouth]
Nicole: Oooh my gosh! There's a criminal in my house! Stay away from my kids! Richard, call the police! AHHHH!!! [Runs around, flailing arms]
Richard: [Dials phone] Hello police, I don't know why I'm screaming. But we really need some help right now! [Runs around, flailing arms]
Anais: Let's all run out of the house with our arms flailing!
[She opens the door, and lets her parents run outside]
Anais: I'm sure if we give them a minute, everything will calm down.
Police Standoff
[The scene switches to a group of police cars and officers surrounding the front yard of the Watterson's house, with police helicopters flying nearby; Richard restrains his wife, while the Doughnut Sheriff watches her try to struggle free]
Nicole: Let me in there! Let me in there!
Donut Sheriff: Sorry ma'am, but this is a police matter. We're professionals, you can trust us. [Looks through manual] Okay, let me see… police negotiations. "Police." Is that one word, or two? You know how some people say "pow-lis?"
Nicole: [Grabs megaphone] RELEASE MY BABIES, OR I'M SENDING IN THE SPECIAL TACTICAL FORCES-
Donut Sheriff: Hey, give me that! I'm the one with the manual! [Through megaphone] Release my tactical forces, or I'm sending in my special babies!
[From inside the house, Gumball and Darwin glare at the chimera]
Chimera: Aw, I'm sorry. This is all my fault.
Anais: Why did you pretend to be our imaginary friend?
Gumball: Yeah. You better have a good story, man!
Chimera: Uh… [Sees Anais' pleading face] oh okay. I was made by an old lonely toy maker. We were the best of friends until the day he didn't wake up. I wandered the streets, then to people's homes hoping to find a friend. Everyone was so scared of me, and chased me away. Everyone… except you guys.
[Gumball and Darwin continue glaring at him, with their arms crossed while heavy streams of tears rush from their eyes]
Gumball: Okay, that was pretty good.
[He and his brother wipe their eyes]
Donut Sheriff: [Megaphone] You have two minutes to comply, or we're coming in!
Darwin: What're we gonna do!?
Anais: Whatever it takes to protect our friend.
[Cuts to them in the living room with rolls of shrink-wrap; Darwin plays some action music]
Anais: What're you doing?
Darwin: I'm setting the mood.
Anais: For what?
Darwin: The bit where we make the traps.
Anais: We've only got two minutes. Faster! [Speeds up the music]
[They quickly set up traps, with some involving putting shrink wrap in place of the window, putting a sprinkler in the backyard, and a pail of water atop a slightly ajar door; Then Anais stops the music]
Anais: Alright, I think we're ready! Everyone in their posts.
Gumball: [Fast and high-pitched] Okay!
[He runs upstairs, full of energy and hits the wall; then he gets up and continues running in place]
Gumball: Sorry, I was in the zone. WHOO!
Raiding the House
Donut Sheriff: Okay, on my mark-!
Nicole: CHARGE!
Donut Sheriff: Hey, I'm the officer in charge here.
Richard: Didn't you hear her? She said CHARGE!
[Police officers charge to the house, The soda cop pulls the door knob, activates a trap, and gets squished by a washing machine; in the backyard, french fry cops try to go through the backdoor, but become soggy when a sprinkler is activated]
French Fry Cop: It's a mashacre!
[Back in the front porch, the coffee cop sees a rake in the house]
Coffee Cop: Not falling for that trick.
[He jumps through the window, but instead gets wrapped in shrink-wrap; the wrap causes him to fall on the rake, puncturing his bottom, and causing the coffee in him to spill; Earl comes through the door, and goes up the stairs; Gumball then activates the attic ladder trap which slices Earl up; In the kitchen, the hamburger cop spots the pail near the top of the slightly ajar door]
Hamburger Cop: [Laughs] You got me, eh?
[Then he sees it activate another trap, which sends a boot to his face that knocks his head/top bun off; the Doughnut Sheriff comes in, and gasps when he sees his badly hurt officers]
Hamburger Cop: Careful! The guy's a monster.
[The sheriff walks to a door, and tries to grab the greasy knob]
Donut Sheriff: Son of a gun, he buttered the doorknob! This guy must be a criminal mastermind. I need to consult the manual. [Reads] "If the situation requires tact and intellectual effort, call someone else." Oh. [Flees]
Donut Sheriff: [Megaphone] You've got thirty seconds to get out, or I'm sending in their mother!
Anais: Okay, there's a very slim chance of any of us surviving that. Put your heads together, and come up with a plan!
[Gumball and Darwin bump heads]
Gumball: I got nothing.
Darwin: Me neither.
Anais: Oh, come on guys! We've gotta think of something. They'll never believe he's innocent, and they won't leave him alone for as long as he lives.
Donut Sheriff: [Megaphone] STOP RIGHT THERE! Put the soda down, and your hands in the air!
[The chimera is seen out of the house, chugging down a bottle of soda]
Chimera: I drank three bottles of unbranded soda, and I got a whole tube of unbranded mints. So please, just let me go, or else... [Slowly motions to eat mints]
Hamburger Cop: Sir, put the mints down!
Donut Sheriff: Hold on! [Reads] "In case of sensitive situation"-- FIRE!
