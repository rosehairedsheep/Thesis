Dedicated Day of Vegging Out
[The episode begins with Gumball and Darwin sound asleep in their bedroom until Gumball suddenly wakes up]
Gumball: Dude, wake up!
[Darwin screams, jumps out of his fish bowl, and jumps back in]
Darwin: What?!
Gumball: It's finally here, the most magical day of all.
Darwin: What? The day where the old, hairy man breaks into houses in the dead of night with a bag for the children?
Gumball: What? No, and for the record, that's the creepiest description of Christmas I've ever heard. I meant today is the day we veg out.
Darwin: You don't want to do anything at all today?
Gumball: No! I'm on strike! It's like if the tiniest thing happens in this town, we end up running a gosh-darned marathon! Look at these.
[Gumball removes the blankets to reveal blue, toned, realistic human legs]
Darwin: Fair enough. So, what are we gonna do?
[Gumball instantaneously appears in the frame, becoming annoyed with Darwin's questioning]
Gumball: Whatever happens, we do absolutely nothing.
[Gumball stands on his bed to announce their plans]
Gumball: First, we shall neither bathe nor groom ourselves. Instead, we shall clothe ourselves in the ceremonial robes of the blanket toga!
[The scene cuts to Gumball opening and closing the fridge for the next paragraph, eventually settling on squeezing fermented orange juice, now cheese, into a glass. Despite what he mentioned about pickles, he doesn't actually get any]
Gumball: Then we shall open and close the door of the fridge so many times that we lower our standards, so many times that we eventually settle for a feast of expired pickles, slightly fermented orange juice, and what was once butter but may now be cheese!
[The scene cuts to Gumball holding a glass that becomes dirty, then carelessly throwing it away in exchange for a clean bowl, but dirtiness starts to cling to the bowl Darwin is holding and he throws that away carelessly as well, lastly Gumball holds a clean plate for the next paragraph]
Gumball: If the glasses are dirty, we shall drink out of bowls, and if the bowls are dirty, we shall drink out of plates!
[For the next paragraph, the scene cuts to Gumball and Darwin relaxing under a blanket on the sofa, then get up in unison, but become dizzy and immediately retreat to their previous position]
Gumball: We shall nest under a blanket under the sofa for so long, that when we stand up, we will suffer vertigo and immediately have to lie back down!
[For the next sentence, it's once again shown that Gumball is standing on top of his bed, then for the next, he gets face-to-face with Darwin to further convey his point]
Gumball: And we shall continue to do naught until we are plagued with the guilt of laziness, and the sweat on our foreheads has turned to grease! Then, my friend, and only then will we have earned the right to go to bed in our own juices! [Gumball pants from exhaustion]
Darwin: Alright, so when do we get up?
[Gumball rushes back into bed]
Gumball: When the discomfort of having to go to the bathroom exceeds the joy of lying in bed. [Gumball falls back to sleep]
[The scene cuts to the outside of the house, eventually cutting to Gumball applying what appears to be a stick of lip balm to Darwin's rear end]
Gumball: There, this should prevent chafing from too much sitting.
[The scene cuts to a full view the living room where the couch is covered in a blanket and a single pillow sits on either side of the blanketed couch. The table holds a glass that is half filled of orange juice that appears to still be fresh, a bowl of cereal. The floor in front of the couch has an assortment of junk food and a plastic bottle of soda that is easy for the boys to reach]
Gumball: Now, do my chin.
Darwin: Okay, but why do you need lip balm there? [Darwin applies the lip balm to a small portion of his left cheek]
Gumball: 'Cause... [His face becomes droopy and his voice changes] ...TV face.
Darwin: 'Kay, by the way, why is the TV the wrong way around?
[The TV is shown to be standing vertically instead in its normal horizontal position. Gumball simply answers his brother's question by lying down on his end of the couch. From his perspective, the TV now looks like it's horizontal. The camera cuts back to Gumball being satisfied with the result and smirks at Darwin]
Darwin: Taking it to the next level, huh?
Gumball: Yup, the next level down.
Darwin: Should I bring a bucket in case we need to, y-you know, powder our nose?
[Gumball pulls his pants away to reveal that he's wearing a diaper; his voice changes drastically into an announcer voice for the next sentence]
Gumball: Slackies, for when you gotta go, but you don't wanna leave. [He lets go of his pants for them to snap into their original position, concealing his undergarment once more. Gumball then sits up]
Darwin: But what if we need to change video games?
[Gumball smirks as he reveals a contraption that can be extended and retracted that has a small claw attached to it. He picks up two other contraptions that are the same one he's holding in his hand to combine them into a longer version that he uses to swiftly grab a game cartridge from the shelf across the room, retracts the device with the cartridge in its grip to blow dust off the cartridge, then extends it once again to place it in the game console in the same bookshelf. While retracting the device, he lets go of the two other contraptions and sets the original one beside him]
Darwin: Wow, I guess you really thought of everything, but what if someone rings the doorbell?
Gumball: Oh, I've got a life hack for that, as well.
Darwin: What?
Gumball: I don't answer it. Come on, let's get into position!
[Darwin lies down on his side, beginning to relax when Gumball grunts irritably]
Darwin: Oh, sorry. [He sits up and pulls Gumball's leg into the same position Darwin got into just moments ago before resuming his position. They sigh in relief]
Tuning Out Chaos
[The phone begins to ring]
Darwin: Aw, man, the phone. What do we do?
Gumball: Nothing.
Darwin: It's really annoying, though.
Gumball: So, the phone's ringing, big deal! [The camera zooms out to have a full view of the living room] We just wait until our brains tune it out.
[The boys begin to forcefully tune out the noise of the ringing, and it goes away]
Gumball: See? It just went away- [Gumball is interrupted by a space scientist banging on the window outside of their house, much to the boys' surprise. As the Hazmat Worker is speaking, citizens can be seen evacuating in the background]
Hazmat worker: This is NASA, you need to get out! There's a meteorite in direct collision course with Elmore-
Gumball: So, there's some space scientist outside, big deal! We just wait until our brains tune it out.
[They once again forcefully tune out the noise, but we then see that the aforementioned meteorite has struck their living room. The ceiling has a massive hole in it and the area surrounding the impact is slightly charred, including the boys]
Gumball: So, there's a meteorite in the living room, big deal! We just wait until our brains tune it out.
[The boys are about to tune out of their situation, but the meteorite cracks open and releases green fumes that pollutes the air around the house. This is revealed to be a virus that practically kills Gary as evident by his choking and sudden collapse. Death is further confirmed when a crow drops out of the sky]
Gumball: So, there's a bit of a virus going around, big deal! We'll just wait for our brains to tune it out.
[They forcibly tune out the situation again only for a futuristic battle to begin happening in their living room between a group of hazmat workers, Carmen who has been mutated to have six legs, Hot Dog Guy is also mutated, but doesn't seem to be partaking in the fight, the hobo attacking the hazmat worker near the back, and Jeff who has been mutated to have six legs pulls a worker outside of a window. Gumball is slightly mutated as evident by small growths protruding from the top of his head]
Gumball: So, people have six legs now, big deal! We'll just wait for our brains to tune it out.
[They once again forcefully tune out of their situation only to find their house nearly destroyed in a post apocalyptic battle with the Mayor of Elmore shouting at them over the sounds of warfare as he shoots at the enemy]
Mayor of Elmore: This may seem like the end of our kind, but your blood may contain the key-
[Wordlessly, Gumball and Darwin tune out to see that they are in the middle of nowhere as a massive space ship crashes in the distance as a mutated Carmen runs past the screen before being shot and killed. The boys tune out again to see that they now stand surrounded by members of a galactic council as they're no longer sitting on their couch and are now dressed in outfits that allude to the Star Wars franchise]
Galatic Council leader: The Galactic Council would like to thank you for your acts of bravery in defeating the-
[They tune it out to find themselves back in their living room dressed in tuxedos surrounded by insectoids. One of the male insectoids is carrying a female]
Insectoid: The princess is ready for her wedding-
[The boys tune out once more to find themselves already married to the female insectoid who is now very old as Mike and Ken are broadcasting an interview with the boys]
Mike: How does it feel to be married to a wife from another planet?-
[They tune out one more time, and everything is back to normal]
Things Are Starting to Get Weirder
Gumball: See? It simply went away. [The camera pans to the left to reveal a Japanese man wearing a schoolgirl outfit] Who the who is that?
[The Japanese man dances and claps whilst speaking in Japanese]
Japanese man: Ito maki maki, ito maki maki, ito ito, ton ton ton.
Darwin: I think we should stop tuning things out, we're kind of losing the plot here.
Gumball: Meh. [The boys resume relaxing]
Japanese man: You're not going to ask me how I got here?
Gumball: [He groans before coming up with an answer] Nah.
[The boys begin watching TV when an announcer is heard]
Announcer: [On TV] Coming up next, Robot Dinosaur Destruction Derby...
Gumball and :Darwin: Ya-a-ay.
Announcer: ...has been replaced by a documentary about the Swedish sheet metal industry."
Gumball and Darwin: Ugh.
Narrator: Gothenburg, nineteen-fifty-three...
[Gumball proceeds to reach for the remote on the coffee table, but a spontaneous train passes by the house and vibrates the table to make the remote get further away from the feline's hand. Before he can grab it on the second try, the shock waves from the motion of a dragon being ridden by the two eggheads further pushes the remote away. On the third try, Gumball is about to use the contraption shown at the beginning of the episode to grab it, but is too startled by the outside, revealed as a simple backdrop, falling over and revealing the background of the Void]
Gumball: You know what? Forget it. [Gumball sighs and lies back down] Maybe there'll be a cool accident at the sheet metal factory.
[The camera cuts to the television screen depicting real-world sheet metal workers]
Narrator: And their factories are the safest in the world.
[The boys sigh disappointedly and hear a cell phone ring loudly, much to their annoyance. Gumball sits up and answers the phone]
Gumball: What?
Caller: Do you want to play a game?
Gumball: Oh, sure, I got a game!
Caller: Then how do we play?
Gumball: Like this! [Gumball hangs up and sighs heavily] Man, why is the universe so determined to get us to move today? Wouldn't its time be better spent sorting out poverty or world hunger or those awful dog filters on ChatSnap? [The phone rings once again] What now?
Caller: The game is on. I'm here.
Gumball: Then why are you calling me?! [Gumball hangs up]
[The TV starts to glitch as a figure crawls out of their screen with unkempt, long, black hair and an extremely small frame. His body is covered in wrinkles despite not having any old age. The boys sigh disappointedly]
Specter: Really? You're going to do me like that?
Gumball: Can we just not do this right now?
Specter: Do you know how long it took for me to do my hair? What, you think it's easy to look like this? You didn't even look at it. [Gumball sighs, exasperated] Do you even want to know what's in the box? [Specter is holding a box, but after becoming sad, he sets the box down] Wow. Okay, I think I'm gonna go. [He opens the door] It was a cursed teddy bear with human teeth. It was gonna creep closer to you every time you looked away.
Darwin: Mm, wow, th-that sounds pretty scary.
Specter: Don't! The surprise is ruined now. [He is about to leave]
Gumball: Wait up!
Specter: [He comes back in] Yes?
Gumball: Pass us the remote before you go.
[Specter walks back in and picks up the remote off the floor and hands it to Gumball]
Specter: Just one last thing before I- [He gets cut off when Gumball changes the TV and decides to leave. The camera pans to the Japanese man wordlessly standing to the left]
Gumball: You can go too, by the way.
Japanese man: Okay. Hyah-ee!! Teleportation! [The Japanese man disappears as he is enveloped in a rainbow]
[The doorbell rings, and Gumball becomes excited]
Gumball: [Screams] Burrito delivery!
Darwin: I thought we weren't getting up.
Gumball: No need to. [Gumball starts to yell] Uh, hey, can you post the burritos through the mail slot?
Larry: What?
Gumball: Ugh. W-what part of that didn't make sense?
Larry: Everything from "post" to "slot," if I'm honest, but the customer is always right, I guess.
[Larry proceeds to push the burritos through the slot, but the burritos become a mess as soon as they're pushed through]
Gumball: Did you bring the extra guac? [The guac is pushed through the slot] Okay, now feed your hands through the mail slot.
Larry: What? Why?
Gumball: Do you want your tip or not, dude? [Larry feeds his arms through the slot] 'Kay, there's a shovel to your left, grab it. [Larry struggles to reach for the shovel, but manages to get it] Now use it to flip the burritos towards us.
Larry: What? That's crazy! I didn't sign up for this!
Gumball: It says on your website that you deliver directly to us in under twenty minutes, and the clock is ticking, man. [He turns on a game show to see that the countdown on TV is in sync with the time Larry has left: seven seconds. It is here that we see Gary is alive in this instance of reality]
Larry: Eh, okay, okay! [Larry shovels the food to the left, but uses the wrong end of the shovel]
Gumball: No, no, wrong end of the shovel. [Larry turns it the other way. Despite using the correct side, he's flinging it to the right] No, wrong direction. Come on, buddy, time's running out. [Larry flings the burritos in the correct direction, getting it all over the walls, floor, couch, and on the boys' faces. They each clean their own faces with their tongues and share a fistbump, satisfied with the service] Mm-kay, now hold out the shovel for your tip!
[The camera cuts to Larry holding the shovel as coins are thrown at him. The few coins that were on the shovel did not make it outside]
Larry: There's nothing here!
Gumball: Meh, keep the shovel then.
[The camera cuts to the outside of the household where Larry is shown driving away on his scooter]
Larry: Darn kids never appreciate anything.
[Lightning strikes their house and destroys their TV. With an exasperated sigh, Gumball takes out his cell phone]
Darwin: Are you calling the TV repairman?
Gumball: Nah, I'm video-calling Banana Joe.
Banana Joe: Hey, man. Thanks for calling! Wanna hang out?
Gumball: No.
Banana Joe: Oh. Then what I can do for ya?
Gumball: Turn your phone to the TV.
Banana Joe: Okay! [Turns it to the TV] Anything else?
Gumball: Yeah, stop talking, I'm trying to listen.
Banana Joe: Okay. [Wheezes quietly]
Gumball: Yeah, and can you stop breathing please? I can't hear.
Banana Joe: No problemo! [He is heard holding his breath]
Universe vs. Protagonists
[The sofa in the living room goes awry, knocking off the boys]
Darwin: Ow! What is going on here?
[The camera pans around to see that the sofa is now a flat piece of cardboard]
Gumball: Alright, universe! Bring it on!
[An electrical shock can be heard and the thermostat's temperature rises to 168 degrees, then keeps rising past 234 degrees]
Darwin: Okay, maybe we need to at least deal with that.
Gumball: Eh, in a minute.
[Everything in the room, including the boys, starts to literally melt]
Darwin: You said you'd deal with it.
Gumball: I said I'd do it in a minute. You don't have to remind me every hour.
Darwin: I feel like I'm about to pass out.
Gumball: Oh, good idea. Just lie down flatter. Uh, heat goes up, right?
[The boys lie down and seem to be getting over their discomfort when the news comes on]
Mike: We interrupt this week to bring you some breaking news. The police and fire departments are desperately trying to rescue a family who crashed their car on a freeway bridge. The authorities are unable to approach the vehicle due to the bridge's extreme instability; however, they say it may be able to support a lighter weight one, maybe two, twelve-year-old boys.
[The family is revealed to be the rest of the Wattersons screaming as their lives are close to being ended. Gumball and Darwin are horrified and declare that they must save them]
Gumball: Come on, Darwin, we gotta go!
[The car seems to restablize]
Gumball: Wait, maybe not.
[The boys lie down, but the car seems like it is going to fall]
Gumball: [Rising up along with Darwin] Oh, no, we do have to go!
[The Wattersons sigh, signifying assumed restabilization]
Gumball: Or maybe not.
[Whenever they lean up, it restablizes. This occurs until the boys decide to run out of the house]
Gumball: All right, all right, we're going! Man.
[Banana Joe is shown to have fainted from holding his breath]
Saving the Wattersons
[Gumball and Darwin are shown outside of the house seeming as if they are running; however, it is revealed they are both relaxed on wheeled chairs. Gumball and Darwin notice Hank and George blowing leaves with their leafblowers]
Darwin: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Gumball: Yes. It'd be far too much effort to make the detour to get these leaf blowers.
Darwin: Exactly.
[Gumball and Darwin continue their slow journey in their chairs]
Gumball: Wait, I've got a better idea. We got wheels! We just have to stop and let the rotation of the Earth do the leg work for us.
[They sit still, hoping to achieve their plan]
Gumball: [Giving up] All right, let's just call the cab company.
[The scene switches to the rest of the Wattersons in the car, screaming. They stop due to Nicole's cell phone ringing; Nicole picks it up]
Nicole: Hello? Gumball? What do you mean you need a ride? I'm dangling off a bridge here. No, I can't— No, Dad can't, either. We're stuck here in mortal d— Look, I don't have time for this. [Hangs up]
[Richard's cell phone rings; Richard picks it up]
Richard: Hello? Yeah, sure I can. What time? [Notices infuriated Nicole] Uh, I mean your mom already said no, goodbye. [Hangs up]
[Scene switches to Gumball and Darwin, as Gumball sighs in vain of getting a ride]
Gumball: [Sighs] No dice.
Darwin: Oh, I got an idea.
[Scene switches to the Wattersons in their dangling car; Nicole's cell phone chimes]
Nicole: [Reading] "Your order is being delivered—" Did anyone order anything?
[After Richard shakes his head, Gumball is heard, catching attention of the Wattersons]
Gumball: You mind moving forward a little? [Shown in a mail service van] A little more.
[Gary, the driver, moves forward the van slightly]
Gumball: Little more.
[Gary does it again]
Gumball: Little more.
[The van, moving forward once again, knocks over the barrier set up by the police]
Gumball: Okay, perfect.
Gary: [Exiting van and holding Gumball and Darwin packed as boxes] That'll be thirty-five dollars!
Nicole: What?!
Gumball: Sorry, we couldn't be bothered to buy stamps, [Points to half a dollar and two coins taped on the box] so we improvised.
Nicole: [Sighs] Can you just help us out, please? [Throws her wallet at Gary]
Gary: [Falls from the wallet's impact; then, throws a single coin at Nicole] Here's your change!
[The coin ends up hitting the trunk, causing the car to dangle off even further]
Gumball: [Worried] I'm coming!
[Gumball and Darwin slowly come toward the car]
Darwin: We're not gonna make it! We're gonna have to get up from our chairs!
Gumball: Not on my day off.
[Gumball comes closer to the car, adjusts the height of his seat, and rests his legs on the back of the car, saving the Wattersons from falling off. Gumball sighs, and the car's back wheels regain their grip, driving backward the car away from its potential peril]
Nicole: [Exiting the car] Gumball, you did it!
[Nicole, Richard, and Anais are shown in a pose, in anticipation to hug Gumball]
Richard: Come here, son!
Gumball: Nah, you come here.
Nicole, Richard, Anais: Ugh.
Back at Their House
[Gumball and Darwin are shown back at their vegging on the couch, as if nothing had happened]
Gumball: [Yawns] So, what's left on our to-do list?
Darwin: [Pulling out to-do list] "Nothin'."
Gumball: Well, I guess we better get on with it. [Operates his remote]
[Gumball and Darwin scream in terror as a message written on the wall above the television appears]
Gumball: [Reading] "This is a message from the future. The strange things that happened today were for a reason. And it was all the work of…" Oh, my gosh, Darwin.
Darwin: Who could be sending that message?
Gumball: No, I mean I just found couch candy!
Darwin: Whoo-hoo!
[Gumball and Darwin eat said couch candy and resume their vegging; they sigh. The message continues with the words "ERR… FORGET IT…" The episode ends]
