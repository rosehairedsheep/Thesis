Chocolate
[The Wattersons are at Elmore Shopping. The kids keep pestering Nicole, who is pushing a cart full of groceries]
Anais: Mom, instead of milk, can we have chocolate milk?
Nicole: No.
Darwin: Instead of eggs, can we have chocolate eggs?
Nicole: No.
Gumball: Instead of bread, can we have chocolate bread?
Nicole: No. [Sighs] Richard, can I get a little help here, please?
Richard: Sure. [Walks to the kids] Here kids, [Grabs a chocolate bar] stop bothering your mother and eat this chocolate.
[Nicole groans and swiftly kicks the chocolate bar out of Richard's hand]
Gumball: What the...?! Well what's the point in dragging us here if we're not getting some kind of treat?
Nicole: [Strained voice, speaks through gritted teeth] Because we're having a nice family outing and that should be reward enough.
[Gumball starts to whimper]
Nicole: Don't you dare.
Gumball: [Screams and cries while lying down and bangs on the floor] I WANT THAT CHOCOLATE!
[Nicole sighs, and just as Darwin and Anais copy Gumball, Richard starts screaming. Gary walks by and gives Nicole a judgmental stare]
Nicole: [Grabs two cans of hot dogs and speaks in a high-pitched voice while staring at the one on her right hand] Oh, Mommy, I want some chocolate. [Stares at the one on her left hand in a normal pitched voice] I'm sorry, little sausage, but you had too much candy this week. [Closes her eyes in a high pitched voice] WAH WAH WAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH! [Squeezes the can in her right hand so hard it explodes; normal voice] Now all the little sausages are punished and going to have to wait in the car.
Huggy Bites
[The kids wait in the car furiously]
Darwin: This is the face she's gonna get when she comes back. [Frowns while holding his breath]
Gumball: Eh, pretty good, but this is how you do a sulky face. [Tries to strain himself and points at his vein] It's all in the detail.
Darwin: Eh, it would be better if it throbbed.
Gumball: No problem. [Strains intensely and pops his eyeball out and gasps]
Anais: I can't believe [Pushes Gumball's eyeball back in its socket] we've wasted a day at the mall without getting anything.
Darwin: You know what we should do? We should make full-sized paper models of ourselves, set the car on fire, and push it off a cliff to teach Mom a lesson.
Gumball: Uh, I think I have a better, less horrific idea.
[We now see some people shopping inside the store]
Gumball [On microphone] Customer announcement! As support for our campaign, Huggy Bites are offering a life-time supply of jelly beans for the first to mega-hug the blue lady in aisle three.
Nicole: Huh?
Gumball: Huggy Bites. More love than you can chew.
[Nicole is surprised to see customers running at her. They jump on top of her]
Richard: No! Get your hands off her! That's my wife! [Throws customers off]
[Nicole inhales and looks at Richard happily, but Richard suddenly jumps on her]
Richard: If anyone's going to win those Huggy Bites, it's me!
[Darwin and Anais get candy and walk to Richard]
Richard: Hey, what is going on here?
Darwin: [Gasps] Please don't tell!
Richard: [Gasps] You should be ashamed of yourselves. What would your poor mother thinks about this kind of behavior?
Anais: What would it take, to make all this, go away?
Richard: Eighty-twenty. And throw in some Huggy Bites as well for tricking me and those poor customers.
Darwin: [Gasps] That's it! I'm telling! Ms. Mom, we came up with this really clever idea to get candy behind your back, and Mr. Dad caught us and now he wants a massive cut of it— [Nicole pushes Richard's hands aside and glares angrily at Darwin while growling. Darwin smiles nervously and turns back] ...aaaaaaand it's back to the car.
I'm the Man!
Richard [Trying to sound like Nicole]: Your children deserve a better example, you need to grow up, don't forget your appointment at the cardiologist! BORING! Discipline, I'm not a punisher! I'm a fun-isher! and she's not the boss of me!
Gumball: Have you ever told her this?
Richard: Huh, YEAH! Lots of times... in my head.
Gumball: What about to her face?
Richard: Nah kids, she'll snap me like a twig
Gumball: Okay, I think we need to work on this.
[Back at the shop]
Gumball: [yelling at Richard] Let's go through one last time, WHO ARE YOU?
Richard: I'm the man!
Anais: And what does a man do?!
Richard: Whatever the heck he wants!
Darwin: And why?!
Richard: Because I'm a beautiful powerful animal!
Gumball: [Yelling] Then let me hear you roar!
Richard: [Roars like a cat]
Gumball: Now suck that gut in!
[Richard sucking in his gut]
Gumball: Clench those pecks! [Forces his nipples to stay upright] uh... and how do you feel?!
Richard: Man-tastic!
Gumball: Good! Now go and get us some candy!
Richard :[Walks towards Nicole] HEY WOMAN! You're gonna listen to me and you're gonna listen good! I'm calling the shots now!
[Nicole's head is still turned back from Richard]
Richard: Hey! You listen to the man when he's talking!
[Nicole turns back and gives a powerful and deadly death stare to Richard that somehow blows all of the items off of the shelves. Richard states in disbelief as his chest goes limp]
Everybody's Getting Candy!
[The Wattersons are seen in the car again]
Anais: [Gasps] I've got an idea!
Gumball: Alright, let's hear it.
Anais: Supermarkets are designed to sell you stuff that you didn't even know you wanted. Everything counts, from the height of the product, to what it's placed next to.
The person who Anais demonstrates as a customer: [Picks a bread and a cheese] Ah! I want a cheese sandwich!
Anais: The music is important too. But more than anything, you wanna make them think it's a bargain.
Gumball: You paranoid nut bar, that stuff doesn't work.
Anais: Then why are you holding a basket full of lipstick?
Gumball: Three colors, five dollars! It'd be stupid not to buy it!
[As Anais stares at him, Gumball realizes what she's saying]
Gumball: This. Is. Perfect! If we use those tricks on Mom, we can get anything we want! It's foolproof! [Starts singing happily] Who's getting candy? [Points at Anais] Owww, you're getting candy! Uh! Uh! [Starts dancing]
Darwin: I'm getting candy! [Twirls around] And he's getting candy!
Richard: I'm getting candy?! [Pretends to shred on an air guitar] Uhn! Uhn! She's getting candy! [Points at Anais]
Anais: Mmm, mmm, mmm-mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm! I'm getting candy, [Points at each of the three boys] you're getting candy, he's getting candy, he's getting candy, she's—
Nicole: [Appears from behind them; yelling] Get back to the car!
[The Watterson's walk out in disappointment]
Massage and Makeup
Hexagon lady: [Approaches Nicole] Excuse me, madam, but maybe you'd like to try...
Nicole: [Yells furiously] Maybe what? Maybe you know better about disciplining my family than I do?! Maybe I shouldn't be screaming like a lunatic in the mall?!
Hexagon lady: [Speaks nervously] No, no, no. I just thought maybe you'd be interested in a...
Nicole: [Continues yelling] What?!
Hexagon lady: [Continues] ...free relaxing massage on aisle thirteen?
Nicole: [Continues yelling] Well, maybe I am! Thank you for the kind offer!
[Gumball, Darwin, Anais, and Richard are seen getting back in the car. They all sigh, then immediately get out again. Nicole is then seen on the massage chair.]
Nicole: [Sighs] Oh yeah... After the day I had, that's just what I needed to...
[A broken bone sound] [Gasps] I can't move! What did you do? Can you undo what you just did?
Hexagon lady: A...Actually, I...I need to go speak to my manager, 'cause I normally work on the deli counter and I... I gotta go.
Nicole: WHAT? You can't leave me like this! [Sighs] Huh?
[Gumball suddenly appears in front of Nicole]
Nicole: Why aren't you in the car?
Gumball: Well, here's the thing: we have all been through a lot today and... [Chuckling] I was thinking, wouldn't it be better if you just bought us a treat from the supermarket?
Nicole: Never!
Gumball: Hmm... I see. then how about... A free makeover session?
[The kids apply makeup crazily over Nicole's face]
Nicole: No! No! Not the eyebrows!
Gumball: It's nothing personal, Mom.
Richard: It's just business!
Nicole: [Straightens her back] Rrrrrr... uh! [She then furiously points at Richard, Gumball, Darwin, and Anais, telling them to get back in the car, again]
[All four sigh]
Stealing Candy
[The Wattersons are seen in the car again. After a few seconds, Anais starts crying. Gumball starts crying as well]
Gumball: [Sobbing] I can't believe it ended up like this!
Anais: The whole afternoon ...wasted!
Darwin: The important thing is, we tried... even if, [Crying] we failed!
Richard: No! It's not over! [Adjusts rearview mirror] There's one more thing we can do, but you have to do exactly what I say!
[Back in the supermarket]
Gumball: [Struggling to eat a candy bar taken right from the supermarket shelf] I...I...
Richard: Come on son, eat it!
Gumball: I just can't take stuff without paying for it! [His hand suddenly slaps his face] I have been raised too well.
Richard: Oh come on! It's not that difficult! You open the bag [Opens candy bar], you eat the candy [Munches on the candy], you put the bag back where it was, and no one will ever know.
[The alarm sounds. Richard then spits the candy out back in its wrapper]
Nicole's Limit
Nicole: Let me get this straight. I asked you to finally step up as a father and set a good example for your children, and the way you interpreted that was to take them shoplifting?
[Richard sighs]
Nicole: That's it. I think you've all done it. You have finally pushed me over... [Laughs]
Darwin: Over what?
Nicole: [Her eyes turn yellow] The limit!
Richard: Does that mean we can't get a candy bar?
[Nicole moves her hand at Richard, but manages to restrain herself, breathing heavily, and instead punches the nearby electric regulating box. Electricity crackles as the supermarket loses electric power]
Nicole: You need to... [Her eyes shone up and start glowing] [Demonic Voice] RUN! NOW!
Gumball: What's wrong with Mom?!
Richard: That's not your mother anymore! That's a whirlwind of fury!
[Nicole chases after her family in a rage]
Richard: [To the other supermarket shoppers] Get out of the way! She's out of control!
[The supermarket shoppers flee in terror]
Gumball: Whoa!
[He trips on a bunch of candies, as Nicole closes in; Gumball screams]
Richard: Gumball!
Gumball: I don't want that candy anymore! Huh?
[Nicole runs past Gumball, Darwin, and Anais]
Anais: Watch out, Dad! It's you she wants!
Richard: Somebody please help me!
Guard 2: Freeze, ma'am! [Steps in front of Nicole with a taser in his hand] Please, don't make me do this!
[Guard 2 fires his taser at Nicole. Electricity crackles as Nicole seems finally subdued. But then she rises up, pull the taser electrodes from herself, then grabs Guard 2 and stare into his eyes. Nicole's stare cause Guard 2 to appear to be aging rapidly, his hair and facial hair growing long and whitening at the same time his scream gets higher Nicole then drops Guard 2]
Guard 2: I wasn't trained for this. Please, somebody, help me!
Gumball: You need help?
Guard 2: Yes, please, please, I'd do anything!
[Gumball, Darwin, and Anais all smirk at each other. Nicole continues searching for Richard. She then sees him, and begins charging straight for him. Richard screams as she approaches, but Nicole hits the TV that he was broadcasting himself on instead. Richard stops screaming and continues to run]
Karen: Free samples, sir?
Richard: Ooh! [Looks at Nicole] Ahh! [Munches, then he uses the paper plate to throw at Nicole, but since the plate is made of paper, it merely floats upward, then falls down the ground] Huh.
Richard: Aah! I'm finished!
Darwin: This way, Mr. Dad!
[Richard follows Darwin's direction. Gumball spills some liquid detergent on the floor, making Nicole slip on it, crashing into a stack of canned foods. She rises from the pile and sees Gumball and Richard down the aisle]
Gumball: Dad, can I have some candy?
Richard: Sure, son. Just don't tell your mother.
Nicole: [In a deep scary voice] RICHARD!
Gumball: Dad, stop sweating, you are gonna give it away!
Richard: Easy for you to say! It's not you she is after!
[Both Gumball and Richard start screaming as Nicole gets closer]
Gumball: Darwin, Anais, now!
[Darwin and Anais use transparent duct tape to wrap and seal the aisle, trapping Nicole]
Gumball: Sorry Mom, we just need you to cool down for a minute.
Richard: Yeah, what kind of example are you giving the kids?
[Nicole then stares through the wrapping, melting it out of the way as she slowly approaches her family as she was about to kill them all. Shocked of her own reflection from the facing mirror when Richard  steps aside she quickly regains control of herself, and her eyes turn back to normal]
Nicole: [Gasps] [In normal voice] Oh... my... gosh... What am I doing? I am so sorry. I completely overreacted. What kind of mother am I?
Richard: No, it was me! What kind of father am I? A fat man-child! A chubby Peter Pan!
Anais: We didn't respect your authority, Mom. We know you're only doing it for our own good.
Darwin: And when a parent says no, they mean no.
Gumball: [Sighs] I hope you can forgive us.
Nicole: [Sighs] Of course, sweetie. Every child tests the limit from time to time, and most husbands do that all the time.
[All take a breath of relief then they hug each other]
Nicole Let's go home. I'm exhausted.
[Nicole and Richard walk away to the parking lot]
Guard 2: [Peeks out from behind the shelf] [Speaks nervously] Is she gone?
Anais: Depends. Do you have what you promised?
[Guard 2 hands out candy bars to Gumball, Darwin, and Anais]
Gumball: Thanks.
Anais: Thank you.
Darwin: Thanks.
Guard 2: Please... never come back.
