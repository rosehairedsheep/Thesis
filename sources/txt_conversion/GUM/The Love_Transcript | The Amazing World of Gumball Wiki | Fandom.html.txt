What Is Love?
[In the library, Gumball and Darwin are on the computers when they hear mechanical noises. They go investigate with their hands to their ears]
Gumball and Darwin: What the--?
[Bobert's brain is exposed with a screwdriver in it]
Gumball: Bobert, what happened?!
Bobert: Unknown malfunction detected, attempting self-diagnosis.
Darwin: What's wrong with your system?
Bobert: A virus is parasiting my hard drive. File name: ILOVEYOU.EXE.
[Gumball and Darwin sigh, relieved]
Gumball: Dude. It's not a virus, you're in love.
[Bobert returns to normal]
Bobert: Processing information. Terminology unrecognized. Define love.
Darwin: Well, love is in the air. It's in your heart, in the eyes of others. It's in the way people touch, the way people talk. And it's all over the universe.
Bobert: If I understand you correctly, you have narrowed the definition of love down to everything and everywhere and everyone. Does not compute.
Gumball: Maybe a song would help you understand. Come on, man, count us in!
[Gumball and Darwin prepare to sing]
Bobert: A one, a one zero, a one, one zero, one one, one zero zero--
Gumball: Okay, you know what, never mind.
Gumball and Darwin: Love. What is love?
Bobert: Yes, that was my query.
Gumball: What is love?
Darwin: Does it fall from above?

Love [luhv] def: 3. It's all about chemistry.
[The background, houses and trees are in green and white. Two simple-designed stick people, both male and female, walk in]
Narrator: Love was once a mysterious force, understood by birds and bees. But today, it can be explained by science.
[Two stick figures look at each other, designated by arrows]
Narrator: Love begins with a visual signal received by eyes. This signal goes directly to the stomach, causing what we call in scientific terms "butterflies."
[Arrows from the female stick figure go into the male stick figure's stomach, causing it to behave in shock]
Narrator: The signal bounces back, causing the body to go into shock.
[The male stick figure's stomach goes directly to his heart and lungs, causing the organs to behave in shock]
Narrator: The body then experiences a rise in temperature, causing the palms of the hands to perspire.
[The male and female stick figures' skin turns red and their hands began to sweat]
Narrator: The shock extends to the lower parts of the body, causing a symptom known as "jelly legs."
[Both stick figures begin moving their arms and legs]
Narrator: Finally, the signal reaches the brain and significantly reduces any form of cognitive ability.
[The female stick figure's brain appears and the signal goes to her brain and melts it. Scene cuts to both stick figures continued to move around and behave awkwardly. They finally run past each other. The female stick figure happily hugs another female stick figure and the male stick figure happily hugs another male stick figure.]
Narrator: Oh. Oh well, scratch that. There are no rules to love. So let's just dance.
[Dance music appears as the stick figures began to dance with their partners]

The Moon: Looking hot. Hehe.
The Sun: Yeah, I get that a lot.
The Moon: You know, I was thinking maybe we could-ugh. [Mocking herself] Looking hot. That's like asking Saturn to give me a ring. Well done, Moon.

The Moon: [Appears again, but in a crescent shape] Oh hey, hey.
The Sun: Oh hi. Say have you lost weight?
The Moon: Oh what, this? No, it's just if I stand in the shadow of the Earth, it's kind of slimming. Look. Skinny [Goes to the left side] Chubby! [Goes to the right side] Skinny. [Goes to left again] Chubby! [Goes to right again]
The Sun: [Laughs] Oh hey, I was wondering if you wanted to, you know, come hang out on this side.
The Moon: Uh, ya huh! [Goes down to the Earth; people scream] Whoops, I just flooded Europe. It's okay, I've got a better game.
