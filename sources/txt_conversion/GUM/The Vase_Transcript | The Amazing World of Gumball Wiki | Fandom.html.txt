Urn Concern
[The episode starts with a panic-stricken Nicole searching the kitchen cabinet, then underneath a bed. At the same time, a large garish vase looms ominously by the living room window. Her heart racing, she checks inside the storage area beneath the stairs. This catches the attention of Gumball, Darwin, and Anais, who are on the nearby sofa]
Anais: Mom, what are you doing?
Nicole: [Pacing to the window] Ugh! There's not a single bit of space left in this whole house!
Anais: What for?
Nicole: [Grimaces; Points at the vase] That!
[Her children all shudder in unison]
Gumball: It's like a ceramic cry for help.
Nicole: [Talking through her teeth] It's a beautiful and generous gift from your grandmother, and I like it very much.
Darwin: If you like it so much, why can't you look directly at it?
Nicole: I can!
[She inhales sharply and focuses on the vase, but her eyes turn away involuntarily. On the second attempt, her eyeballs disappear into her skull and pop out the other side, startling the kids]
Nicole: See, I'm looking at it right now. Oh, I love looking at it.
Richard: [Enters from the kitchen] Yahh! That vase is still here! I thought you said, "Don't worry honey, I'll find a hiding place for that hideous monstrosity."
Nicole: [Chuckles nervously] What are you talking about? I love this vase.
Richard: Then why did you say, "That vase looks like the type of vase a rebellious vase would date to make its parents angry?"
Nicole: [Sighs] Fine, I hate it.
Darwin: So how come you told Granny Jojo you liked it in a high-pitch voice, while smiling like this? [Mimics a forced grin]
Nicole: Okay, kids. Sometimes when you're an adult, you have to lie. All of the time about absolutely everything. And never show your feelings because it's impolite. Sit on them until you die, then bury them with you like the ancient Egyptians did.
Gumball: You don't have to tell us. My last present from Granny Jojo was a pair of orthopedic shoes.
Anais: Yeah, and I didn't exactly ask Santa for an expired can of tuna fish.
Gumball: And Dad could not have wanted those ridiculous granny undies.
Richard: [Wearing said undergarments] Hey! I asked for these. They're comfortable, and keep everything in the right place.
Gumball: I just wish she'd bought you the top half, too.
Anais: Wait a minute... Orthopedic shoes, old-person food, and a girdle? She's—
Nicole: It's called re-gifting. It's a way for her to share the gifts she's been lucky enough to receive herself.
Gumball: [Bluntly] You mean she's passing off all her unwanted junk on to us, and pretending it's generosity.
Nicole: [Rebuking] Hey, a gift isn't just an object. It's the thought behind it. [Concedes] And... she puts no thought into them whatsoever.
Gumball: Why don't you just, you know...
[Hopping from the couch, Gumball pretends to pick up the vase and drop it. He gasps, cries into his hands, and winks at his mother, but she does not respond]
Gumball: I mean smash it and pretend it was an accident.
Nicole: Because that would make me a terrible role model. [She slowly grins wickedly, resembling The Grinch. Fiendishly] But children are allowed to have that kind of accident.
Anais: So... you're saying you want us to smash the vase?
Nicole: A good mother would never ask such a thing. Don't you dare break this vase. [Winks]
Gumball: So... you don't want us to smash the vase?
[Nicole contorts her face into several peculiar expressions, after which she heads out the front door]
Gumball, Darwin, & Anais: Huh?
[Standing on the other side of the glass, their mother points to the vase, mimics smashing it on the ground, and stomps on the imaginary pieces. She finishes with an elbow drop and gives them another wink, as well as a thumbs-up]
Art Attack
[The three siblings carry the vase to their bedroom and hold it out the window]
Gumball: Okay.
Gumball, Darwin, & Anais: Three, two, one—
Gumball: No! Wait, wait! We should say something cool first. [Grabs the vase] I'm afraid you lost the pottery lottery.
Darwin & Anais: Ehh.
Darwin: Oh! I got one! [Takes it from Gumball] Looks like this wasn't orna-meant to be.
Gumball & Anais: [Shaking their heads] Mm-mm.
Anais: [Lifts the vase up] In your vase!
[Her brothers nod in approval, and she lets it fly toward the sidewalk. They watch in anticipation as it plummets, but unexpectedly, it is the concrete that breaks instead, leaving the vase intact]
Gumball, Darwin, & Anais: [Disappointed] Oh.
Anais: Maybe this is gonna be harder than we thought.
Darwin: I guess it wasn't orna-meant—
Gumball: Dude, it didn't work the first time.
Darwin: [Whimpers]
[They bring the vase to the backyard shed, placing it in the bench vice. Gumball twists the handle using all his strength, which results in both the vice and entire shed splitting in half. Next, the vase is suspended from a tree branch like a piñata. Darwin, blindfolded, belts it with a baseball bat. It hits Anais, then loops around the branch to bash Darwin from behind]
Gumball: [Watches the vase swing up again] Huh, I would've thought I'd get hit.
[As expected, it comes back down, striking him as well. Their next idea involves Darwin taking a sledgehammer to the vase. The hammer rebounds upon impact, pummeling him in the face due to its vibration. Following this, Anais formulates a plan to launch the vase against a tree trunk using a home-made slingshot. The ceramic projectile cleaves right through the base of the tree, causing it to topple towards her]
Anais: I need to revise my calculations. [Gets squashed]
[Persevering, Gumball places the vase in the path of an oncoming semi-truck. He then hides behind a nearby fence, with his siblings, to await the inevitable collision. However, the vase is in no way affected by the crash. The truck, on the other hand, becomes airborne, flipping entirely upside down. After this latest failure, they take the vase to a mailbox]
Gumball: What's the most surefire way of guaranteeing something will break? [Seals the vase in a self-addressed box] Put it in the mail, marked "Fragile."
[Eventually, the mailman drives by their house to deliver the parcel. First, he tosses it from the moving vehicle, then proceeds to back over it. Getting out of his van, he kicks the box repeatedly before punting it against the door]
Gary: Woo-hoo! [Rings the doorbell] Mailman. Special delivery.
Gumball: [Off-screen] Uh, we're not here. Could you just, um, post it through the door?
Gary: Makes sense to me.
[Shoving the package into the mail slot, he stomps on it until the door breaks in half. As Gumball eagerly opens the mangled box, his excitement turns to shock over what he finds inside]
Darwin: That's not the vase.
Anais: Yeah, that's the tablet Gumball asked Mom for, for his birthday.
Gary: There's this, too.
[Gary drops another parcel on the floor, and leaves. The sides of the second box fall away, revealing the vase to still be in pristine condition]
Gumball, Darwin, & Anais: [Irate] Agh!
Gumball: It's hopeless. It's indestructible.
Anais: Wait, there's still something we haven't tried. What's the most mindless, destructive, butter-fingered force in this house?
Commercial Breaking
Gumball, Darwin, & Anais: [Entering the kitchen] Dad!
Anais: Uh, why are you spreading butter on your hand?
Richard: Duh, we ran out of bread.
Gumball: Right... Could you do us a big favor, and just, uh, [Offers him the vase] hold this for maybe five seconds?
Darwin: But whatever you do, don't drop it.
Richard: Sure.
[Richard grabs the vase, and immediately his hands begin to tremble. Sweat beads on his face, as he struggles to maintain his grip. Somehow, he succeeds, much to his kids' frustration]
Gumball, Darwin, & Anais: Ugh!
Gumball: [Angrily] Why couldn't you have managed that when I was a baby?
[They take the vase back to the living room, and sigh]
Darwin: So what do we do?
Gumball: I guess we just need to accept it. We're gonna be lumbered with this vase for the rest of our lives.
["Rest of our lives" echoes, and Gumball imagines the future. In it, he is at home, waiting for his date to the prom]
Richard: All set for your prom night, son?
Gumball: Uh, yeah?
Richard: [Gasps] There she is!
[The vase appears at the top of the stairs, wearing a pink dress]
Richard: Isn't she beautiful?
Gumball: Uh...
[In Anais' hypothetical future, she is posing with the vase for her graduation photo]
Larry: Okay, graduates. Say, "synthetic organic cheese substitute."
[Darwin is then shown at a very old age, lying in a hospital bed. The vase is sitting on a chair next to him]
Darwin: I never thought I'd say this. But, vase? You were the best gosh darned friend I ever had. [Wheezes; Passes away]
[Gumball, Darwin, and Anais, all stare at the vase in fear]
Darwin: That... wasn't my vision.
Gumball: We've seriously gotta get rid of this thing.
Anais: But how?
[An advertisement plays on the television, accompanied by a catchy tune]
Lyrics: Elmore Wrecking Yard
We wreck 'em! We're on the ball
Cars! We wreck 'em
Trucks! We wreck 'em
Printer cartridges! We wreck 'em
Divest yourself, it's good for you
Bathrooms! We wreck 'em
Anais: Hmm... wait a minute.
Lyrics: Steam trains! We wreck 'em
Gumball: Yeah, this ad's really distracting.
Anais: No, don't you see? That's it!
[Anais runs outside with the vase, and Gumball follows her. Darwin stays behind to dance to the jingle]
Lyrics: Divest yourself, and lose your blues
Darwin: [Singing along] Elmore Wrecking—
Anais: [Re-enters the house] Darwin! Come on!
Darwin: Sorry.
Vase of Mistaken Identity
[Over at the Rainbow Factory, Nicole is working in her cubicle when the phone rings]
Nicole: Hello?
Granny Jojo: It's your mother-in-law.
Nicole: [Groans] Tell her I'm not here.
Granny Jojo: [Irked] No, it's your mother-in-law speaking right now.
Nicole: Ohh. [Chuckles nervously] Hiya.
Granny Jojo: Listen, Nicole. About that vase, I got it mixed up with an equally hideous one.
Nicole: Aha! So you admit it's ugly.
Granny Jojo: Only to me. Beauty is subjective, Nicole. You of all people should know that.
[Nicole fights to suppress her animosity]
Granny Jojo: Anyway, it's what's on the inside that counts.
Nicole: [Flattered] You're saying you like my personality?
Granny Jojo: I'm talking about the vase. It contains the ashes of Roosevelt.
Nicole: What, the Roosevelt?
Granny Jojo: Yes, the Roosevelt. How many other pet pythons has Louie had? Anyway, I need that vase back. I'll come over and collect it this evening. [Hangs up]
Nicole: Uh—
[Nicole rushes home and kicks in the front door]
Nicole: [Panicking, holding bottles of glue and tape] Where's the vase?! Where are the kids?! And what does python ash look like?!
Richard: [Off-screen; Singing] Owls, we wreck 'em. Vacuum cleaners, we wreck 'em.
[She follows his voice to the kitchen]
Richard: Curt rails, we wre—
Nicole: Richard, why are you eating butter from the pack?!
Richard: Duh, there's still no bread.
Nicole: [Stares in confusion at what he just said, then shakes her head] Where are the kids?!
Richard: No idea. They went out with that ugly vase, but I don't know where. [Singing] Ugly vases, we wreck 'em. Fridges, we wreck 'em. Toasters, we wreck 'em.
Nicole: [Gasps] The wrecking yard! [Exits the kitchen; Promptly returns] Stop eating butter! It's not good for you. [Leaves again]
[Meanwhile, Gumball, Darwin, and Anais, have arrived at their destination. There, George is about to close up for the night]
George: Listen kids, the wrecking game's changed. We made that commercial years ago. These days, with all the health and safety rules, we mostly just crush cars, trucks... cars.
Gumball: Listen dude, our Mom gave us permission to wreck this ugly vase. Do you really want to stand in the way of three rookie wreckers?
George: [Sniffles; Unlocks the gate] Go wreck it, kids.
[They head into the yard and put the vase on the seat of a derelict car]
Anais: Okay, switch it on.
[Gumball grabs the controller for the magnetic crane]
Darwin: Oh, w-w-wait! [Fastens the seat belt]
Anais: Darwin, you do realize we're trying to break this thing?
Darwin: Sorry.
[Gumball presses the power button, and a magnet lifts the car to bring it to the crusher]
Nicole: Stop! [Rushes on-screen; Frantic] Don't destroy the vase!
Anais: Gotcha, Mom. Don't destroy it.
Nicole: No, I really mean it this time!
Darwin: Don't worry, Mrs. Mom, we get it. [Winks]
Nicole: No! I'm being straight with you, Granny Jojo gave me the wrong vase. Stop the crane!
Gumball: I gotcha. [Disables the controller; Winks]
[Nicole glances at the vehicle overhead, then dashes to the ladder leading up the crane. She tries to climb, but the base of the ladder breaks off in her hand. Dropping it on the ground, she heads for a second crane in the hopes of crossing between their jibs. However, its ladder is broken as well]
Nicole: Come on!
[Next, she hops onto a nearby car, then from there into a bucket connected to the crane's hoist. After riding it all the way up, Nicole runs along the top]
Nicole: [Shouting down] What I'm about to do might look cool and impressive, but don't ever, ever do it yourselves, okay?!
[Gumball, Darwin, and Anais, wink simultaneously. When Nicole reaches the end of the the crane's arm, she tries to leap across to the other one but comes up short, falling directly onto the hood of the car containing the vase. An alarm blares above, signalling the imminent release of the vehicle into the crusher]
Nicole: [Worried] Oh boy.
[The magnet drops its load, and Nicole plummets with the car. Reaching inside, she fights to free the vase from the seat belt. When that does not work, she flings herself through the open door, kicking the vase out. She then jumps from the car, moments before it lands in the crusher, and rolls to the ground next to her children. Nicole turns to catch the vase and it smacks her in the face, knocking her out]
Gumball: Huh. So she really didn't want us to break that vase.
Ashes to Ashes
[It is late in the evening by the time the four make it back home. Together, with Richard, they sit on the sofa to await the arrival of Granny Jojo. Nicole has a black eye. The vase is on the coffee table in front of them]
Nicole: [Whispering] I really feel like it's watching us.
[The Wattersons are frightened by a loud banging on their door]
Nicole: [Opens the door; Hands the vase to Granny Jojo] Take it!
Granny Jojo: Hm. What with the way you raised your kids, I'm amazed they haven't smashed it by now.
Gumball: [Appears in the doorway] Well actually, Mom told us t—
Nicole: [Covers Gumball's mouth] To look after it, because it contains the ashes of a beloved pet, and we're sad to see it go, but if that's how it's gotta be, then bye!
[When Nicole attempts to close the door, Granny Jojo stops it with her leg]
Granny Jojo: I thought that might be the case, so I've brought you this. [Holds up another unsightly vase]
Nicole: Noooo! [Notices Granny Jojo glaring at her] Oh!  [Picks it up] You shouldn't have. This one's even nicer.
Granny Jojo: Personally, I think it's hideous, but I know you have very different tastes to me. That's the one I meant to give you all along. Anyway, I'd better get Roosevelt back to Louie. He just can't sleep without the dried out remains of a cold-blooded reptile by his side.
Nicole: You haven't been gone that long, have you?
[Granny Jojo and Nicole glare at each other as their hostility rises. Anais intervenes by pushing the door shut]
Anais: So, Mom, what are you gonna do with the new vase?
[Nicole passes it to Gumball, and the family gathers in the middle of their living room]
Gumball: Three, two, one!
[He shatters the vase on the floor, causing a dusty cloud to fill the room. They all cough until the air clears up]
Richard: Whoa. Sure had a lotta dust in it.
Nicole: Yeah... let's all agree that was dust.
[The episode ends]
