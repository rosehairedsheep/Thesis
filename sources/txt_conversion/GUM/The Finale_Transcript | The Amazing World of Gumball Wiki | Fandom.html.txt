Consequences
[The episode begins with the Wattersons sitting on their couch at home. They are laughing]
Nicole: Oh, that reminds me. [Brings out a photo album] Look at what I found in the attic.
Gumball: Oh wow, the family photo album!
Anais: [Takes album and opens it] Let's open it and remember all the zany adventures we've had.
[A photo of the waterlogged house in "The Responsible" is shown as a flashback]
Richard: Oh, that's the time we left you in charge, and you all flooded the house. Do you remember?
Gumball: Do I remember?!
[A clip from "The Responsible" is shown, where the kids are launched in the sky by a geyser and then splat on the ground. When it ends, the Wattersons all laugh]
Anais: We must have fallen four thousand feet straight onto the sidewalk, and walked away without a bruise.
Darwin: Oh, and look. [A photo of the house, completely repaired and normal, is shown] That's the house twenty minutes after being irreparably water damaged.
[Anais turns the page again, and we see a photo of the Wattersons sitting on the couch with their former season one designs]
Gumball: Is it me, or did we all look a bit... off?
[The Wattersons laugh again]
Darwin: Let's look at another. [A photo from "The Mustache" is shown] Haha, do you remember the time we swallowed Mr. Dad's supplements and turned into men?
[A flashback of "Because We're Men" is shown, but is suddenly interrupted by the doorbell ringing. Richard opens the door, revealing Mrs. Jötunheim]
Richard: Hey, Hector's mum, what brings you here?
Mrs. Jötunheim: Do you remember the time when your kids wound up my boy and he went on a rampage?
Richard: Oh yeah, I remember... [Flashback transition sounds]
[Clips from "The Colossus" are shown, Hector is seen destroying the town. The flashback is interrupted by Mrs. Jötunheim]
Mrs. Jötunheim: Enough flashbacking! If you remember well, seventy-five percent of Elmore was destroyed and somebody has to pay for it!
Richard: You mean it didn't all end well like it always does?
Mrs. Jötunheim: [Takes out a sheet of paper and hands it to Richard] Here's your half of the bill for the reconstruction work.
[Richard gasps as the sheet of paper unfolds, revealing a long list]
Mrs. Jötunheim: Why are you looking so surprised? Did you really think we lived in some sort of fairy tale? 'Cuz wake up buddy, we don't.
[Mrs. Jötunheim gets on her broom, and flies away, then disappears. Someone clears their throat. Richard sees that Principal Brown has appeared]
Richard: [Whispering] Weird, that lady gnome seems to think that things we've done in the past have consequences in the now.
Nigel Brown: Is there an adult in the house? [Walks into the living room]
Nicole: Oh, hi, Principal Brown.
Nigel Brown: I'm afraid I have some not-very shocking news. It appears Gumball and Darwin have to restart school from kindergarten.
Gumball, Darwin, Anais and Nicole: [Their heads jump] WHAT?! Why?!
Nigel Brown: Because all you do at school is argue about your little problems and aggravate students and staff members until they go nuts and chase you through the halls. None of which makes for a decent education! [Leaves]
Gumball: [Breathing rapidly] I'm hyperventilating. [Grabs Darwin and breathes into him, using him like a paper bag]
Darwin: [Pushes Gumball away] Stop it. You're making me hyperventilate!
[Gumball and Darwin breathe into each other. The telephone rings and Richard answers it]
Richard: Oh, hello officer. Really? I don't remember any reckless driving.
[A quick montage of all of Richard's terrible driving is shown]
Richard:  Right... well I think I just won't pay the fines and wait for this to all blow over. Bye. [Hangs up]
Anais: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. If you don't pay, they could send you to jail.
Richard: That's exactly what he said, but don't worry. I've been imprisoned heaps of times. They put you in then straight away you're just not in there anymore.
Nicole: This bill is eight hundred thousand dollars. It says if we don't pay by tomorrow, then they can take our house away. What is going on today?
Anais: It seems the results of all our reckless actions are finally catching up with us.
Gumball and Darwin: We need to do something!
Anais: You're right! But this time instead of diving head-first into whatever stupid idea, we should- [Richard, Gumball, Darwin have disappared] aaaaand... they're gone.
How Do We Fix This?
[Gumball, Darwin and Richard are running down the street]
Gumball: So, the plan is we do all the schoolwork we've haven't done in one shot.
Richard: Yeah, but first, we need to get the money for that greedy troll woman.
Darwin: But how do we do all of this in one day?
Richard: We need transportation.
[Richard notices a bus driving down the road. He steps out into the street and blocks the bus' path]
Richard: Stop the bus!
[Gary sees Richard on the road and screams in alarm]
Gary: Wait!
[Gary slams on the brakes. The bus slows down, but hits Richard, sending him flying backward. Richard forces the bus doors open and throws out Gary. Gumball, Darwin, and Richard enter the bus and drive away]
Gary: That's my bus!
[Richard drives the bus recklessly down the street. However, he stops to pick up Siciliana, then continues ahead. In the Justice Department offices, Nicole and Anais plead their case to Martha]
Martha: I'm sorry Mrs. Watterson but this is the Justice Department, not the "I'm sure everything will be okay if we just sweep it under the carpet and forget about it" Department. You're gonna have to pay the money.
Nicole: This is ridiculous, you can't take our house. We're nice people.
Martha: Interesting you should think so. Maybe we should consult your files.
[She opens a drawer and begins to remove an extremely long stack of papers. She places it on the table. Nicole tries to speak, but is interrupted]
Martha: That's January.
[Begins pulling out another stack of papers. Meanwhile, in the Fitzgerald backyard, Richard has crashed the bus through the house. The Wattersons exit the bus]
Richard: Okay, okay fine, you're right. [Crawls on the ground] The front door wasn't wide enough for a bus, but-
Patrick: You! [Waves a spatula at Richard] I should've known when I saw a bus driving into my living room that a Watterson would be at the wheel.
Richard: Ah! [Grabs a pair of steel tongs] Stand back! I've got a weapon too!
[Patrick drops his spatula and grabs a cooking grid. Richard grabs a rake in response. The other Fitzgeralds walk out of the hole the bus made in their house, and gasp at the two fathers]
Gumball: Dad!? What are you doing?!
Tobias: [Appears from the other side of the fence] Dad fight!
[A crowd appears and starts chanting "Dad fight". Richard and Patrick notice things may have gotten out of hand]
Patrick: [Whispers to Richard] This has escalated a little too far, do you really want to have a fight?
Richard: [Pretends that the fight were to happen, and ends up choking] Definitely not.
Patrick: Look, just pretend to hit me with the handle, and I'll go down.
Richard: Good plan.
Patrick: On three. One, two- [Richard hits him too early] Dugh! Ugh...
Crowd: Ohhhhhh!
Richard: [Whispers to Patrick] Good acting.
Patrick: [Opens an eye]
[Back at the Justice Department, Martha is reading to Nicole and Anais]
Martha: December twenty-fourth, car collision with Santa Claus. February fifth, willful destruction of a mobility scooter. April second- oh [Her phone rings, she answers it] Oh I see, thanks. [Hangs up and writes]
Nicole: Sorry, what are you doing?
Martha: Apparently your husband just crashed a hijacked bus into a house and assaulted a man with a rake.
Nicole: [Starts to lash out, but manages to restrain herself] Oh, you... [Pats Martha's head]
Martha: Mmhmm... [Writes] Assault on a municipal officer.
Nicole: [Kneels] Oh come on, please! You have to help us! Is there something we can do to fix this?!
Martha: Well... I suppose you can go and apologize to everyone on this list to get them to drop the charges and forget about the millions of dollars you owe them.
Nicole: ...Great!
[Nicole grabs some papers and leaves with Anais. Martha is surprised, then sighs]
Martha: The problem with having a sarcastic voice is that no one can tell when you're actually being sarcastic.
Plan B
[Gumball, Darwin and Richard are in front of Elmore Junior High]
Gumball: Okay, we got off to a shaky start, but if we just pull together and stick to this new plan, I'm sure things are gonna go our way.
Darwin: So to recap, Gumball and I will sneak into the hospital and give each other facial reconstructive surgery to make us look like the two highest achievers at school: Bobert and Alan.
Gumball: Meanwhile, Dad will pose as Dane Prinella big red bus.
Richard: [Wearing a disguise] Fish n' chips.
Gumball: And we'll convince Alan and Bobert's parents to pay him the entrance fee for a made-up British boarding school called something really English like uh... Scotland; simultaneously paying off our debts and allowing us to replace them at school.
Richard: Ah, perfect and simple. What could go wrong?
[An empty street is shown, then Gumball (disguised as Alan; his head is detached from his body, his neck is twisted to look like Alan's knot, a string is connected to his head and body, and he has bandages all over his head), Darwin (who is disguised as Bobert with grey paint), and Richard appear, running from several police cars and dropping dollars on the road. Meanwhile, at a store called "Chunky Bite", Nicole and Anais try to reconcile with Larry]
Nicole: [Banging on door] Come on, Larry, just let me in. I'm sure we can talk this through.
Larry: [Peering through shaft in door] No! Every time I so much as look at a Watterson something terrible happens- [Screams as something crashes] Okay, I take that back. Seems just talking to a Watterson's enough.
Anais: But don't you think a class action lawsuit is a slight overreaction for repeatedly scaring off your fiancé?
Larry: [Opens a small sliding door] Every time you guys mess something up I have to pay for it out of my own wages. Why else do you think I have so many jobs?
Anais: Hmm, never thought about that before.
Nicole: Look, I'm tired of your attitude, mister! I'm coming in there and we're going to shake hands and make up like adults.
Anais: Mom! You can't do that!
Nicole: [Starts to lift the door] Yes... [Grows muscles and a monstrous voice] I can!
Anais: No, I mean you can't do that because he's got a- [Nicole forces the door open, Anais sighs] restraining order on us...
[In a jail room, Gumball, Darwin and Richard are being stared down by other inmates]
Richard: [Whispers to Gumball and Darwin] Now, what you do when you arrive in prison, is you punch the biggest guy in the room, then no one w- [Darwin hits his knee] Ow!
Gumball: He said punch the biggest, not the fattest!
Darwin: Sorry.
Richard: Now it hurts here, [Points at his knee] and here. [Points at his heart]
[The door opens, Nicole and Anais enter. The door shuts behind them]
Richard: [Relieved] Thank goodness, your mother's here to bail us out!
Anais: [Sighs] Not this time...
Gumball: What!? You're in here too? Ugh... hold on, that's alright. I'm sure some unforeseen detail that usually gets us off the hook is gonna pop up riiiiiight... now.
Donut Sheriff: [opens a small sliding door] Wattersons, you're free.
The Wattersons: Yes!
Donut Sheriff: ...to remain silent! Otherwise, no dinner tonight. [Closes door shut]
Gumball: [Sobs] Where's my happy ending?
Anais: This is the end guys, show's over.
[Everybody bows their head as the scene slowly fades to black]
Gumball: No. [Turns on light]
Richard: What?
Gumball: I said no! It doesn't end like this, not on my watch! [Gets up from the bench and starts a speech] They say we've gone too far but I say we haven't gone far enough! We're busting out of here! [Points at a large inmate] Hey punk! My dad says that if his dog was as ugly as you, he'd shave its butt and teach it to walk backwards.
Richard: [Laughs nervously as the inmate looks at him angrily]
[Outside the prison, the wall explodes as Richard flies through it and into another wall. Richard gasps as his face swells into a huge purple bruise]
Gumball, Darwin and Anais: Dad! [Exit the room]
Nicole: [Shakes the prisoner's hand] Oh thank you, thank you! This is for breaking us out of here.
[Nicole kisses the inmate on the cheek]
Nicole: And this is for punching my husband.
[Nicole squeezes the inmate's hand so hard that he squeals like a little girl and collapses]
Nicole:  Okay, what now?
Anais: I think Gumball was on to something. Up until now, every bad situation has gotten worse and worse until it somehow just fixed itself. There's only one solution left.
Richard: What is it?
Anais: [Hands out papers containing charges against them] Everyone take a problem, part ways, and produce a problem more problematic than a problem of that proportion should probably be.
Gumball, Darwin, Nicole and Richard: Huh?
Anais: Just do what you do best. [Evilly] Make things worse.
Murphy's Law Realized
[At Elmore Junior High, Gumball and Darwin cause destruction, knocking down students, and bedlam in the hallway]
Gumball: It says here, that Mr. Small is suing us for giving him claustrophobia that time we got him stuck in the filing cabinet.
[Mr. Small's office, Darwin is showing Mr. Small an open envelope]
Mister Small​: Uhh...I'm sorry, but I don't see any kind of surprise for me inside your su-
[Gumball pushes Mr. Small into the envelope]
Gumball: Sorry, sorry Mr. Small.
Darwin: [Licks the envelope seal] Do you think we've made things bad enough?
Gumball: [Thinks for a moment, then takes the envelope and folds it; Mr. Small continues screaming] There. Now let's go and post him to the smallest country in the world.
[as Gumball and Darwin leave, Darwin returns to push Mr. Small's stuff off the table. At the Watterson house, Richard opens the freezer and gasps]
Richard: Kenneth! [Kenneth, frozen in the jar, is shown inside the freezer] The gross jar creature! [Takes the jar] Are you sure this is a good idea?
[A flashback of Kenneth attacking the helicopters in "The Microwave" plays]
Anais: Yep. This is exactly what we need.
[Richard places Kenneth's jar into the microwave and warms him up. He thaws out quickly and opens an eye. At Hector's cave, Nicole is greeted by Hector]
Hector: Hi, Mrs. Watterson. Did you come to give us the money you owe us?
Nicole: Uhh.. nah, I just need you to give your mom a message. [Sharp inhale] Tell your mom... that she's so short she needs shoes for her chin. [Cowers as Hector growls] Uhh, also... tell your mom she's so fat that her high school photo was a double page spread. [Hector growls louder] And finally, tell your mom that she has so many warts... that her face spells "Ugly" in Braille.
[Nicole is running down the street, she grabs the Newspaper Employee's cellphone as a car flies into the ground behind her. Hector is seen chasing her and attacking everything in his path]
Nicole: Okay, the plan worked pretty well! [Dodges a car, and spills the Blue Repairman's drink] How are you guys doing? Is Kenneth in good spirits?
Richard: Yup, it's pretty bad!
[Kenneth throws a car into a house and grabs a bus full of students]
Richard: He's eaten everyone on the bus! [A tire flies past him] ...and the bus!
[Anais, Nicole and Richard meet up, and find themselves in between Hector and Kenneth. Hector beats his chest as Kenneth roars at him, and they wrestle with each other]
Richard: How do we get out of here?!
[Somebody whistles]
Gumball: [On the Senior Citizens' scooters with Darwin] Quick, jump on!
[The Wattersons get on the scooters and drive away, the Senior Citizens following behind them]
Marvin: Hey! Come back with my scooter before I forget why I'm running after you!
[The Wattersons arrive home. Richard slams the door shut as an angry mob forms outside]
Richard: Well, I think we've pretty much ticked off the whole town.
Quattro: They dropped our baby!
Julius: They blew up my head!
Santa Claus: They ran me over!
[Mr. Small and Mowdown break into a window]
Darwin: What do we do now?!
[Another window breaks]
Rob​​​​​​​​: They kicked me down a manhole!
Gumball: Ahh! They're getting in!
Gary: They took my bus!
Marvin: They blew up my watch!
Richard: [Poking people with a broom] Somebody think of something, I can't hold 'em off forever!
Nicole: No! This is it! It's all over! The end of the Wattersons!
Gumball: The only thing that can save us is reality being completely reset by some kind of magic device!
[The episode ends abruptly]
