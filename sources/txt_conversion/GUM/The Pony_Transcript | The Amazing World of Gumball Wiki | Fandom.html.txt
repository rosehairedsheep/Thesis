The Worst DVD Ever
[The episode starts at the Ripley 2000 store, with a line of people including Quattro, Sarah, Ocho, Pantsbully, Mr. Poop, Newspaper Employee, and Carrie, all looking impatient. Gumball and Darwin are at the front of the line, trying to pay for their DVD, but an invisible wall prevents Gumball from handing over the DVD to Larry]
Larry: [Sighs] What is wrong with you this time?
Gumball: [Struggles to give Larry the DVD] This movie is so sucky that my body refuses to rent it.
Larry: Then don't rent it and get outta here.
Gumball: I can't, I promised my sister.
Darwin: [Sighs and puts his hands out] Give me that.
[Gumball hands over the DVD to Darwin who then takes a deep breath and runs towards Larry, but an invisible force field repels him to the floor]
Darwin: You're right, this film is so bad that every atom in my body refuses to pay to see it.
Carrie: [Grabs DVD from Darwin] Oh come on, it can't be that bad. [Gasps loudly] A Pony's Tail?! Wow. Okay, I'm gonna rent this for you or we're gonna be here all day. Maybe if I hide it between my good films, my mind will be tricked.
Gumball and Darwin: Carrie! Carrie! Carrie! Carrie!
[Carrie tries to push her DVDs through the invisible force field]
Carrie: [While pushing the DVD through] It's not working!
Gumball: Come on, Carrie!
[Carrie manages to push the DVD through and causes a big blue flash of light. Afterwards, the trio walk out of the store]
Carrie: You know, there are easier ways to hurt your eyes. [Hands the pony DVD to Gumball] You could pour salt in them while you stare at the sun, for example.
Gumball: I'm sorry, Carrie. It's just I promised Anais we'd do something she wanted today.
Darwin: We didn't realize how unbearable it'd be, and we haven't even watched it yet.
Gumball: Come on, we're already late.
[Gumball and Darwin run off-screen]
Helping a Fat Man out of a Manhole
[Gumball and Darwin stops at a pedestrian crossing]
Gumball: Oh, man. We're gonna get the face when we get home.
Darwin: What? This one? [Darwin starts frowning]
Gumball: No, that's silent fury. What we're going to get is "I know you let me down".
Darwin: Oh. [Darwin starts frowning differently]
Gumball: [Points at Darwin] That's it. But don't forget the slow head shake.
[Darwin starts shaking his head slowly]
Darwin: I can handle that, as long as we don't get the "you mean nothing to me" back turn.
[The traffic light changes to the green walking man, so Gumball and Darwin start running across the road]
Gumball: Don't worry, as long as nothing gets in our way, we'll be fine.
[The scene changes to a row of stores where a blue repairman is working on a truck next to an open manhole; Tony is jogging along, but falls and gets stuck in the manhole in front of Gumball and Darwin. They stop beside him, then everybody looks at the teal tow truck driver]
Teal Tow Truck Driver: ...What?!
Darwin: Uhhh, don't you think you should help that guy? You clearly took the cover off.
Teal Tow Truck Driver: So? You guys are way closer, that means it's your problem.
Tony: Uhh, can I get a little help here?
Gumball: Listen, man, we'd love to help, but we're kind of in a hurry.
Tony: Well, I'm kind of in a manhole.
Darwin: Which you wouldn't be stuck in if you weren't quite so--
Tony: What, fat?!
Darwin: [Nervously] No. What I meant was-
Tony: Voluptuous?! Flesh-ripped?! Horizontally tall?!
Darwin: DISTRACTED! I WAS GONNA SAY "DISTRACTED"! [Shakily] I think you're a beautiful man.
Gumball: Still, what kind of bozo runs around not looking where he's going, blindly texting on his phone?
Tony: I wasn't texting, I was updating my status so everyone knows I'm jogging.
Gumball: Why?
Tony: [Looks down in disappointment] To get those little thumbs-ups on ElmorePlus.
Gumball: [Sighs] Alright, let's get you out of here, you attention hog.
Darwin: [Calls Anais from a payphone; Anais looks furious] Heeeey! You're doing the face, aren't you?
Anais: Why are you late?!
Darwin: Heh heh, well, funny story, uh, we were helping a guy out of a manhole--
[Gumball can be seen tying Martin with rope to a truck in the background]
Anais: No need to lie. It's obvious you guys don't wanna watch the movie with me.
Darwin: Oh, no, that's not true. I can't wait to watch [Loudly] SOME PRINCESS TRYING TO TAME A STUPID PONY JUST TO IMPRESS SOME FOPPISH PRINCE FROM LUXEMBOURG! [Normal voice] Sorry, I didn't mean to say that. It's just that my brain refuses to let me lie about this film.
Anais: Just hurry up, okay? [Hangs up phone]
[Scene cuts to Martin and Gumball waiting for the truck to move]
Tony: Uh, are you sure this is a good ide-AH! [Truck pulls him out of the manhole]
Gumball: There. Whose problem is it now?
Remembering Rob's Name
Darwin: [With haste] Dude! We need to get home! She's already at a force five on the guilt trip scale!
Rob​​​​​: [Appears in front of the boys] Gumball! Darwin! What's up, guys?!
Gumball: [Nervously] Heeeeeey... Rich?
Rob​​​​​: [His smile fades] Did you just call me "Rich" like it was a question?
Gumball: [Facepalms] Ha! Did I say "Rich"? I'm-I'm sorry, dude. I meant, uh... your name.
Rob​​​​​: Which is?
[Gumball and Darwin laugh nervously]
Rob​​​​​: Which is?!
[Both sigh. Darwin opens his mouth as if he remembers, but does not]
Rob​​​​​: ROB! My name is Rob!
Gumball: Rob! Of course, man, I'm sorry. Hey listen, we're in a massive hurry, but we should totally hang out soon. I'll-I'll call you, bro.
[Gumball and Darwin start to leave, but Rob blocks their path again]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​: You don't have my number. You don't remember me at all, do you? And this! This is just some hollow promise!
Darwin: Dude, it's not that! We've just been distracted because uh... ha ha, the funniest thing just happened. See that hole?
[Rob leans over the manhole to look. Darwin kicks him down the hole]
Gumball: Darwin! I can't believe you just did that!
Darwin: Did what?
Gumball: Uh... I don't remember... 
Say the Right Thing
[Anais is in the Watterson's living room. She sighs, and suddenly sees Richard eating a slice of pizza. Richard sees her and "unchews" the pizza]
Anais: Dad, am I boring?
Richard: Of course not, sweetie pie.
Anais: Then why don't Gumball and Darwin want to hang out with me?
Richard: Uh... uh... [Thinking to himself] Think, Richard, think! Your little girl is feeling insecure. This is a real parenting situation. What you say now can affect her for the rest of her life, so say the right thing. Say the right thing! [To Anais] The right thing!
Anais: What?
Richard: Speak to your mother! [Runs away]
Sussie's Party
[Darwin running down the street, a tired Gumball following behind him]
Gumball: [Out of breath] I gotta stop, man. I can't keep running like this.
Darwin: [Returns to Gumball and runs in place] C'mon! You can do it! It's all in the mind!
Gumball: You don't understand. My legs have given up. I even have a cramp in my bones.
Darwin: Your legs haven't given up! You have!
Gumball: You think? You should try walking in my shoes for once.
Darwin: Is that a challenge?
[Scene cuts to Darwin's head on Gumball's legs and Gumball's torso on Darwin's legs]
Gumball: [Sees Darwin panting] Whoah, dude! Have you seen the top of your head? You've got a birthmark in the shape of my face! Oh, no, wait, your head is just very oily.
Darwin: Oh, yeah? Well, your legs aren't legs! They're just over-grown toes! Give mine back!
[Both switch back to their original legs]
Darwin: [Shakes his leg] Ah, this is so much better.
Gumball: [Covers Darwin's mouth] Shh! [Points to Sussie's house]
[Darwin turns around and gasps]
Gumball: [Nervously] Sussie's birthday party!
[Both crawl on the sidewalk to pass by Sussie's house. A door is heard opening]
Sussie: Oh! You came!
Darwin: [He and Gumball stand up] How did you know we were there?
Sussie: I didn't. I was just practicing my guest welcome, but since you're here... [Holds up arms] Oh! You came!
[Scene changes to Gumball and Darwin sitting awkwardly in Sussie's backyard with Sussie and her parents, who are breathing loudly. They sit in silence for a few seconds]
Gumball: Wow! What a great party! Yeah, it was really good, but we gotta go now. It's uh, it's getting dark and all. [The sky is shown; it is high-noon]
Sussie's Father: Oh, c'mon, you're not gonna leave now! I haven't seen Sussie so happy.
[Sussie starts laughing disturbingly]
Gumball: [Whispers] I'm sorry, but we need to get home to our little sister. Besides, no offense, sir, but if this party was a person, it would be Sussie.
Sussie's Father: [Whispers] Okay, let's cut to the chase. I'll give you a thousand dollars if you stay.
[Scene changes to Darwin talking to Anais on the phone and Gumball dancing in the background]
Darwin: Ha ha! You have to understand, Anais! This is a thousand dollars we're talking about! We're millionaires!
Gumball: [Runs up to Darwin] I'm sorry, sir, but I think you just dropped [Sing-song voice] a thousand dollars!
Darwin: So... is it okay if we hang out on another day?
Anais: Sure, no problem.
Darwin: Are you doing the sad face with the big wide eyes? [Cut to Anais, who is crying]
Anais: [Sniffles] No, everything is cool.
Darwin: [Pokes his eye through the phone] Right. Let me speak to Gumball...
[Scene changes to Gumball giving Sussie's father his money back, but Gumball will not let go of the money, while also sobbing lightly]
Sussie's Father: [Gumball whimpering] If you're in such a hurry, then why have we been doing this for an hour?
