The Bus
[The episode starts with Sussie and Darwin sitting next to each other in the school bus]
Sussie: Look, sun! Look, house! Look, roof! Look, ball! Look, door! Look, clown! Look, bird! You're not looking! [Points to a dog] BIRD! BIRD! BIRD! BIRD! BIRD! BIRD! BIRD! BIRD!
Darwin: That's a d—... [Sighs]
Sussie: [Smacks Darwin with her arm] WAIT! [Cut to traffic light] RED! RED! RED! RED! RED! RED! RED! [Cut to Sussie] GREEN! [Laughs softly]
[Darwin whimpers and squeezes through the side of the seat, Gumball is playing Street Fighter on a device looking similar to the Game Boy Advance and Anton is sleeping beside him]
Darwin: Dude, I need you to grab the emergency hammer.
Gumball: I'm not breaking the window.
Darwin: No, I need you to knock me out.
Gumball: How about you just ask Sussie to calm down a little?
Darwin: [Whimpers again] I can't...
Gumball: What the... [Pauses video game] You're embarrassed, aren't you?
Darwin Just use the hammer...
Gumball: [Laughs] Darwin Watterson, the fish who grew legs at the expense of his guts!
Darwin: [Annoyed] Shut up!
Sussie: HEY, DARWIN!
[Darwin squeezes his head back out]
Sussie: Which noise do you prefer? ALALALALALALALALALALALALA! or AKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKA!
Gumball: [Sticks head on top of Sussie and Darwin's seat] Excuse me, Sussie, but can you be a little quieter, please?
Sussie: Certainly, young Gumball, I'd be more than happy to oblige!
Gumball: Thank you.
Darwin: [Motions taking hat off]
Gumball: What's that?
Darwin: That was me, taking my hat off to you.
Sussie: [Whispers] Hats!
Cafeteria
Darwin: I still don't understand how you can be so direct with people?
Gumball: OH! It's really hard, you have to think the words and then move your lips at the same time so it makes the right sound.
Darwin: [Grabs Gumball's face and whispers] Teach me...
[Jamie cuts in line. Darwin stares at her]
Jamie: What?!
Darwin: Uh-uh-...
Jamie: Yeah, that's what I thought.
[Darwin mumbles to himself towards Jamie in an angry manner and then nods]
Darwin: That whole argument I just won only went on in my head, didn't it?
Gumball: Well... nothing happened in reality, so I'm gonna have to say yes.
[Darwin starts hitting his face]
Gumball: What's that about?
Darwin: That's me beating myself for being such a door mat.
[The bell rings]
Hallway
Gumball: If you want me to teach you how to be direct, I can. But you have to promise to do exactly what I say. No questions asked!
Darwin: [Kneels, starry-eyed; Light and sparkles come from the top right corner] I promise.
Gumball: I want you to walk like a dog with an itchy butt.
Darwin: [Still starry-eyed] I shouldn't have promised.
What You Want To Say
[Gumball is walking past Tobias and Idaho in the schoolyard, while Darwin drags his butt on the ground like a dog]
Gumball: [Waves to Tobias and Idaho] Hi, guys.
Darwin: I think I actually understand the purpose of this exercise. You're ridding me of my inhibitions by destroying the little dignity I had.
Gumball: No dude... [Laughing] I was just messing with you!
Darwin: WHAT?! [Starts punching Gumball] WAS IT REALLY [Punch] NECESSARY [Punch] TO TAKE ME [Punch] OVER [Punch] THE SAND BOX?!
Gumball: Sorry. [Happy sigh] Just tell me who you want to be direct with, and I'll show you how it's done.
[Scene jumps to Leslie on the payphone]
Leslie​​​: [Talking on the phone] Calm down, honey, you're being over grammatic this guy is too shellfish and he's being a total control Greek.
[Gumball pushes the switch to end the phone call]
Leslie​​​: Do you mind? I was in the middle of a condensation!
Gumball: Wow, I see what you mean now... Come on, tell him how annoying he is!
Darwin: [Phew] Okay. [Phew] You know, Leslie? When you try to sound intelligent sometimes, you just-
[Darwin starts choking]
Darwin: [Strained] You just- [Continues choking]
Gumball: Come on man, speak your mind! You're so bottled up you're choking on your own frustration! [Grabs Darwin and starts squeezing him] SAY [Squeeze] WHAT [Squeeze] YOU [Squeeze] THINK!
[Darwin's mouth pops and he lets out his thoughts like a hurricane]
Darwin: [With a loud voice] WHEN YOU TRY TO SOUND SMART AND MIX UP YOUR WORDS YOU SOUND LIKE A FOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!
[Darwin deflates and then goes back to normal]
Leslie​​​: I- I don't know what to say... Thank you! Thank you for telling me, I'll be forever graceful for your honesty!
Gumball: It's- it's grateful...
Leslie​​​: Ah, yes, I'll be forever grapefruit for your honesty.
[Leslie walks away, as Gumball bows to a delighted Darwin]
That Same Stupid Pose
[Gumball and Darwin are in the library using the computers]
Gumball: HAHA! Hehe.
Darwin: What?
Gumball: Tobias just posted a photo, I'll send it over. [Sends photo]
Darwin: [Annoyed] Oh, for goodness sake! This is another thing that bugs me.
[Darwin skims through a series of Tobias's photos]
Darwin: He's always pulling that stupid pose! So annoying...
Gumball: Well it's not really that annoying, it's just a photo, buddy...
Darwin: It's not though is it? It's ALL the time!
[Camera zooms out, revealing Tobias doing his pose]
Darwin: Dude, FYI, you look totally lame when you pull that pose, WHAT DOES IT EVEN MEAN?!
Tobias​​​ : It's chunkin' the deuce, man.
Darwin: And what does that mean?
[Tobias slowly scoots away]
[Darwin looks at Gumball blissfully as he gasps happily]
What He Thinks About Us!
[Gumball and Darwin are walking in the hallway]
Darwin: You don't understand. For my whole walking life I had to keep my mouth shut, having to deal with everyone's annoying little habits, but now I can say what I like... [Begins to sing] I feel like...
Gumball: Dude, what are you doing?
Darwin: I feel like... [Walks off]
Gumball: [Facepalms and sighs]
Darwin: Ever since I was a young fish, I always held my tongue, Never spoke the words I felt inside and now my time has come. I'd push my feelings deep deep down, now I'll tell the world, [Jumps on top of a ladder, knocking Rocky off of it] ​​exactly what I think and feel, about every boy and girl.
[Ocho, Masami, Banana Joe, Anton, Jamie, Alan, Idaho, Bobert, Tobias, Tina, Carrie, and William appear to sing along]
Rest of Class: Every boy and girl!
Darwin: Yeah!
[The students (joined by Carmen) follow Darwin down another hallway]
Rest of Class: Gonna tell us what he thinks about us!
[Miss Simian does a backwards cartwheel and walks backwards in front of the students]
Rest of Class: Gonna tell us what to do! Gonna tell us what he thinks about us! Gonna show us something new!
Darwin: Stop! Masami's popular and funny, but your friends just like you for your money.
[Masami frowns, turns grey, and floats away, crying]
Rest of class: We only like you for your money!
Darwin: Jamie's rude and impolite because she's half cow half troglodyte.
[Jamie walks away with her head down]
Rest of class: She's half-cow half-troglodyte!
Darwin: Carrie thinks her style's unique, but she's just one more emo freak.
[Carrie becomes shocked by Darwin's insult. Shot cuts to Banana Joe]
Rest of class: She's just one more emo freak!
Darwin: Joe, your jokes are lame and lazy, and you sing just like a dog with rabies!
[Banana Joe runs away, crying. The rest of the students walk away, ending the song. Darwin continues to have his hands raised proudly]
Taking It Too Far
Gumball: Hmm, where do people go when they run away crying like that?
[Gumball follows Banana Joe, and sees him sitting on the floor next to the lockers]
Banana Joe: [Sees Gumball] Uh, haha, I feel a bit silly now.
Darwin: [Off-screen] OH JUST STOP IT ALRIGHT?!
[Shot cuts to Teri spraying a door handle]
Teri: Well, what does it matter to you? You do know there are more germs on an average door handle than there are on a toilet seat.
Darwin: Well, if that's the case, we should all open doors with our butts! [Tries to open door with his butt] Almost got it.
Gumball: Darwin, what are you doing?
Darwin: Just proving a point...
[Darwin opens the door, revealing Principal Brown]
Darwin: TA DA!
Teri: Principal Brown! Darwin is being recklessly unhygienic...! [She moves into the sunlight to show her "ulcers"] And it's giving me ulcers, see?!
Darwin: OH MY GOSH! Your hand, it's covered in germs!
Teri: WHAT?! WHERE?!
[Darwin licks her hand]
Darwin: There.
Teri: NNNNNNNNNNNNYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! [Runs away terrified]
Nigel Brown: Darwin Watterson! This is not like you at all! I can only assume that Gumball has something to do with it.
Gumball: I've got nothing to do with it at all!
Nigel Brown: Nothing...?
Gumball: Well maybe I kinda set him off.
Nigel Brown: That's all I needed to know! Both of you, to the school counselor, immediately.
A Nice Dose of "Shut Up"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: As much as I think it's important for you to be able to express yourselves freely, I don't think comments about my ponytail are appropriate. The back of my head does not look like a horse's buttocks!
Darwin: I swear I'm trying my best Mr. Small, but I just can't stop myself from saying- I'M TIRED OF STARING AT YOUR HIDEOUS! HAIRY! MAN TOES!
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: Eh, uhum. Interesting, I wanna try something, what do you see when I show you this ink blot?
Darwin: A very sad middle aged man wearing sandals.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: [Thinks Darwin is referring to him, and takes a big breath] I think I have the right treatment for your problem.
[Gumball and Darwin walk out of his office; Darwin has tape on his mouth]
Evil Darwin
[In the middle of the silence in the classroom, Sussie is heavily breathing with her mouth, Anton is scratching his face, Tina is tapping her nails on the desk and Miss Simian is drinking her coffee]
Gumball: I'm impressed on how you're managing all this, buddy. I thought for sure you'd- Ahh!
[Darwin is freaking out as the noises continue throughout the class]
Gumball: EVERYONE GET OUT OF HERE! HE'S GONNA HURT YOUR FEELINGS REAL BAD!
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​ : No! We need to listen to him! He's just misunderstated.
[Darwin, enraged, stands up and tears the tape off his mouth]
Darwin: [To Sussie] Hey, chin bag, how about you learn to breathe through your nostrils. Oh I'm sorry... YOU DON'T HAVE ANY!
Sussie: [Whispers] Nostrils.
Darwin: [To Tina] And how about you clip those stupid nails? They're not gonna make you any more feminine. In case you haven't noticed, you're a ten ton sack of reptile flesh!
[Tina sobs]
Sussie: [Whispers] Reptile flesh.
Darwin: [To Miss Simiam] And as for you! [Points at her] The only thing worse than hearing you slurp your coffee is watching it stick to your rancid lady mustache!
Sussie: [Whispers] Mustache.
[Miss Simian runs away crying]
Gumball: Uh, dude, I know I told you to be direct and all but you're acting like a full blown atomic jerk right now, can you uhh, just go back to being a nice guy...?
[Darwin doesn’t respond]
Gumball: Dude?
[Gumball reaches out for Darwin but Darwin slaps Gumball's hand and begins singing with an evil face and demonic background]
Darwin: No more Mr. Nice Guy, I found a new style, with claws and pointy teeth and a villainous smile! Goodbye, Goody Two-Shoes! I'm no longer uptight, cause now I'm a shark and I'm ready to bite! And I'll say what I want, and the truth's gonna sting! I'll be brutal and blunt, it will hurt when I sing! AHAHAHAHAHHA! So look out worl-
[Gumball slaps Darwin and the scene cuts back to normal]
Gumball: You and me, outside, now.
Street Fighter in the Schoolyard
[A versus screen appears between the boys and the scene transtions to a pixelated playground as the two prepare to battle "Fighting Video Game" style]
Gumball:  I don't want to do this man, but it's the only way! You need to learn that words can hurt.
Announcer: Round One! Fight!
Darwin: Your head is so big that you have to put your shirt on feet first! [Shoots energy balls at Gumball] Big head! Big head! Big head! Big head!
Gumball: Ow! Stop It!
Darwin: [Shoots an energy ball] Big head!
Gumball: That's cheating!
Darwin: [Shoots an energy ball] Big head!
Gumball: You keep using the same move!
Darwin: [Shoots an energy ball] Big head!
[Gumball echoes and collapses]
Announcer: Darwin wins! Perfect! Round Two! Fight!
Gumball: You're so ugly that when you entered an ugly contest the judges said no professionals! [Shoots an energy ball]
Darwin: You're so dumb you put stamps on your e-mails! [Shoots an energy ball]
Gumball: You're so short that your head smells like feet! [Shoots an energy ball]
Darwin: Your brain's so small that your thoughts have an echo! [Shoots an energy ball]
Gumball: Your cheeks are so big that people don't know which end of you they're looking at! [Shoots an energy ball]
Darwin: Agh!
[Camera cuts to reality, Tobias, Banana Joe, Anton and Bobert cheers looking unamazed while Gumball and Darwin are still pretending to be in the game]
Gumball: Pshoo! Cling! Pew!
Darwin: Ahh!
Gumball: Your face is so greasy that people put on weight when they look at you! [Shoots an "energy ball"]
Tobias​​​​​​​: Nyeh, it's not as good as I thought it'd be.
[Tobias, Banana Joe, Anton and Bobert leave, still making cheering motions. Camera cuts back to the game]
Gumball: You're so bald, that when you take a shower you get brainwashed!
Darwin: You're so... [Panics] I got nothing!
[Gumball shoots an energy ball and Darwin is "stunned," Gumball comes close with an energy ball in his hand]
Gumball: You're so chubby the back of your head looks like a pack of wieners.
[Gumball punches Darwin with energy, Darwin flies into the air and then back down, smashing a dumpster. Gumball celebrates]
Announcer: Final Round!
Gumball: Wait a minute, pause.
[Gumball holds out his hand and the "game" pauses]
Gumball: Darwin, I think this has gone far enough. Surely you understand what I'm trying to say to you. It's good to speak your mind sometimes but... wha- what, what are you doing?
[Darwin is making shooting motions while whispering]
Gumball: Hey, you unpaused! That's cheating!
Darwin: Big head! [Repeatedly shoots energy balls] Big head! Big head! Big head!
[Energy starts emanating from Gumball]
Gumball: Okay, I didn't want to do this, but you leave me no choice. You are not my brother.
[Gumball starts to use a combo move]
Gumball: YOU ARE JUST A PET WHO GREW LEGS!
Darwin: [Flies into the air] Ahh!
Announcer: Ultimate combo!
[Scene changes to a cutscene with Darwin laying in a destroyed wall, while a "Continue" counter goes down in the corner]
Gumball: I'm sorry, you forced me to do this.
[Darwin starts sobbing. Gumball realizes what he has done and rushes over as the scene returns to reality]
Darwin: Did you really mean that?
Gumball: [Crying as well] No! [Hugs him] I just wanted you back to normal, it just came out!
Darwin: It really hurt!
Gumball: It really hurt me too! I never thought it before, you're totally my brother!
Darwin: [Regains composure] Well, I think you've made your point, and if that's how I made other people feel, I don't want to do it anymore.
Gumball: [Happily sighs] It's good to have you back, buddy.
[The brothers hug]
Darwin: You still have a big head, though.
Gumball: Well, at least mine's got hair on it.
Epilogue
[On the school bus, Sussie is seated beside Gumball and Darwin]
Sussie: AKAKAKAKAKAKAKA...
[Gumball and Darwin stare at each other and nod. Darwin gives the emergency hammer to Gumball. The camera cuts to outside the bus. Gumball and Darwin fly out the window, where the camera freezes. Episode ends]
