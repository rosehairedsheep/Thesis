Bluetooth Speakers
[The episode begins in the Robinsons' backyard]
Gumball: I can't believe you have a pair of Bluetooth speakers in your backyard!
Darwin: I have to say, Mr. Robinson, I'm impressed with how on point you are with new technology!
Gumball: Yeah, you're like a silver firefox!
Gaylord: I got those free when I bought a foot spa from the catalog. They also sent a face massager, but Margaret ruined it when she put it in the dishwasher.
[Gumball pairs Mr. Robinson's phone with the speakers]
Gumball: Well, all systems go, Captain! [gives Mr. Robinson his phone] What do you wanna listen to?
Gaylord: Oh-hoh! I'm not gonna play any music on it. [smiles evilly] Just this.
[Mr. Robinson plays a very loud sound from his phone. This sound nearly deafens Gumball and Darwin, who both shriek in pain; even Darwin's teeth shatter. A raccoon, hearing the sound, walks up to them]
Gumball: WHAT IS THAT?! [his teeth shatter, too]
Gaylord: Oh, it's a frequency only vermin can hear. That's it, get off my lawn!
[Gumball and Darwin continue to shriek. The abovementioned raccoon cuts a door into the nearby trash bag, and hangs up a sign saying "ONLY JUNK MAIL"]
Gumball: IT'S NOT WORKING!
Gaylord: Oh, I wasn't talking about that kind of vermin.
Hearts Broken
[Mr. Robinson's phone vibrates]
Gaylord: Hold on a second, kids.
[Gumball and Darwin recover and look at Mr. Robinson cutely]
Gumball and Darwin: [cheerfully] Of course, Mr. Robinson!
[A shot of Mr. Robinson's phone, Margaret has sent five goat emojis, representing her "Meh"'s]
Gaylord: "Meh meh meh meh." Hmm. [calls...] Margaret? [on phone] Yeah, sorry, I didn't quite catch what that last "meh" was about.
[Gumball and Darwin look back, at the speakers]
Margaret: [on phone] Meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh!
Gaylord: [on phone] Oh, right. Those "Meh mo mi mi" in Miami.
[Darwin rubs his left arm...]
Margaret: [on phone] Meh meh meh meh.
Gaylord: [on phone] What am I doing?... Uh, just tryin' to get rid of those two little meat gargoyles from next door. [Gumball and Darwin gasp] Dumbbell and Garden Waterbagger, or whatever.
Margaret: [on phone] Meh meh meh meh.
Gaylord: [on phone] Yes, the ones I hate.
[As with what happened before, Gumball and Darwin fall through the ground, while Mr. Robinson's "hate" echoes in the background]
Gaylord: [on phone] Yeah, I roped those dopes into installing a new defense system against themselves. They're bigger suckers than leeches making major life choices based on their horoscopes!
[Gumball and Darwin hit a mountain]
Gaylord: [on phone] And they're so ugly! The little red one's got a face even two mothers couldn't love! [Darwin goes through some sort of squisher, distorting his face] And the blue one is like a visual version of drinking orange juice right after brushing your teeth. [Gumball goes through a juice grinder, grinding him up to little pieces] You know what? A quantum microscope couldn't find a quark of charm in those two buttclowns. [Gumball and Darwin go through what looks like water, restoring them back to normal, and land on the ground]
Gumball: To be honest, that last one wasn't so bad, by comparison.
Gaylord: [on phone] Wait, who was I talking about?
[To make things worse for them, Gumball and Darwin are covered with salt, shriveling up. Cut to black, and back to the Robinsons' backyard]
Gaylord: [comes out of door, notices the boys are gone] Huh? Those losers are gone?
Gumball: [hurt, muffled] We heard every word you just said about us, William Shade-speare!
Gaylord: Wait, Where are you?
Gumball: [hurt, muffled] At the bottom of the pit of despair, Mr. Robinson!
[Mr. Robinson puts his ears to the ground]
Gumball: That was a metaphor.
[Mr. Robinson looks up to see a tearful Gumball and Darwin]
Gaylord: Right.
Gumball: You ruined our friendship and left us with these horrible black clouds over our heads!
[Mr. Robinson is confused]
Gaylord: ...Oh.
[There are literal black clouds on top of the boys' heads]
Gumball: And that one's not a metaphor, by the way.
Darwin: Goodbye, Mr. Robinson.
[the boys start to walk away, sadly]
Gaylord: No, wait! Where are you going?
Darwin: There's a lot we need to process... I think we need a therapist.
Gumball: [points to his cloud] And a meteorologist.
Gaylord: Oh, fine. Go see a "get out of my face-ist" as well. [peeks up the Wattersons' fence] And as for an extra prescription, some chill pills while you're there! Hmm! [goes back inside his house, slamming his door]
Gumball and Darwin: Oh! [goes back inside their house, slamming the door]
[Later that day, Mr. Robinson looks out of his window despondently. He flashback to the day Nicole came home with Gumball. A baby Gumball spots Mr. Robinson, and waves at him, causing the latter to react with surprise; he looks like he is going to wave, but shuts the blinds instead. A few years later, toddler Gumball and Darwin have written their letters to Santa Claus. Mr. Robinson comes in and sees Gumball struggling to reach the mailbox. Mr. Robinson gives Gumball a lift, allowing the cat to drop his letter in. Problem is, he's dropped it into a dog waste basket. Skip to another few years later, where Mr. Robinson prepares to swim. A happy Gumball and Darwin skip over to him, and try to jump in, not before Mr. Robinson seems to warn them about something. Gumball looks to Darwin. Later, the two are struggling to swim, tears in Gumball's eyes. Mr. Robinson looks at them... and laughs evilly. Skips to Halloween. Gumball and Darwin are trick-or-treating at the Robinsons'. After they receive their candy, the boys bid goodbye to Mr. Robinson, who shortly after waving at them shuts his door closed. It turns out he gave the boys dog treats instead of candy. Once again, he laughs evilly. Gumball's birthday. Mr. Robinson gives him a cheap bootleg tape of White Snow and the Six Elves. Instead of the tale's original happy ending, White Snow gets poisoned by a pear. The film ends with Gumball and Darwin being horrified and Mr. Robinson laughing evilly once again. Some time after Anais was born, Gumball and Darwin are playing baseball in their front yard as Mr. Robinson crashes into Cartax. He inspects the damage, and instead of taking the blame, he frames Gumball and Darwin; he places the boys in front of the car and takes away the baseball and Darwin's glove, making it look like Gumball was the one who hit the car. The boys, especially Gumball, get a scolding from Nicole, as Mr. Robinson looks on, laughing evilly once again. Fade to the present day, where Mr. Robinson laughs at that moment, then stops sadly. He looks at the boys' bloodshot eyes, and waves at them, but Gumball pulls down his blinds. Only this time it gets jammed half-way, and he has to fix it, struggling to do so. Mr. Robinson sighs sadly, and walks to his porch]
Mr. Robinson's Jail Streak
Gaylord: Ugh, I don't see how things will ever be the same again... short of brainwashing them. [Has an idea, gasps] Of course! [on his phone, searches...] "How to brainwash chi-"
[Cut to him in prison. He is let out by a dog officer to where Rocky is waiting for him]
Rocky: What did you do?!
Gaylord: I followed the advice online.
[both Robinsons get in Rocky's car]
Gaylord: [continued] Turns out it's illegal to alter the minds of children using cold war CIA techniques. It's bureaucratic madness! Next they'll be asking me to pay for a fishing license or something!
Rocky: Dad, you do need a fishing license.
Gaylord: What's this world coming to when a simple tax-paying man like me can't even enjoy feeding himself and his family by throwing a little dynamite in the pond?!
Rocky: Look, if you want to make peace with them, just keep it casual and don't go too far, okay? Just play it millennial!
Gaylord: You mean dye my hair rainbow colors, dress like a fake lumberjack, feed off avocados and inherit a world in ruins?
Rocky: Uh, I guess. But mainly I meant you just, like, poke them! Or, bring them more followers! Or leave a little message on their wall!
Gaylord: [Shrugs] Sounds easy enough.
[Gumball and Darwin look on in shock. It turns out Mr. Robinson wrote "LET'S PLAY A GAME" on their literal wall, completely missing Rocky's point]
Gumball: "LET'S PLAY A GAME"?
[Later that night Mr. Robinson sneaks in with an abnormal smile]
Gaylord: Poke. Poke.
[Before Gumball and Darwin are able to react, Mr. Robinson pokes them literally, again completely missing Rocky's point. Both boys look around, terrified, and Mr. Robinson seems to have vanished! The boys walk around, trying to find their stalker, where numerous random Elmore citizens appear under a street light. Both boys are clearly terrified, and run to either side, only to see Mr. Robinson (again smiling abnormally), who has literally brought random Elmore citizens to follow them, missing Rocky's point once again]
Gumball: What the actual what are you doing?!
Gaylord: What? Just got you more followers.
[Leonard Daniels, Cow Woman and a clown peek out of a bush, a tree and a manhole]
Leonard Daniels: Hello!
Cow Woman: How you doin'?
[the clown waves at them]
Clown: Hey.
[Gumball and Darwin are terrified]
Gumball: You--
[Mr. Robinson is sent to prison again. Rocky awaits him again as he is let out]
