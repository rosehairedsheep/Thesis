Richard's Condition
[Richard and Nicole are in the living room]
Nicole: So, remember, you've got to vacuum the living room, sort out the fridge, and don't forget to take out the trash.
Richard: Yes, commander.
Nicole: Very good. See you later. [Leaves the house]
Richard: [Sits on the sofa in an exhausted way] Can't be bothered. [To the trash bag] Mooooooove. Mooooooooove.
[Gumball and Darwin peek out from behind the sofa]
Gumball: Psst. Dad, you wanna play? [Smiles]
Richard: [Gives up trying to move the bag] Ugh! Unh! I can't play right now. Can't you see I'm taking out the trash?
Darwin: But you promised to play with us.
Richard: [Smiles] How about you little bank robbers take your loot [Scene changes to the trash bag] to the safe house? [Camera changes to the wastebasket] Huh?
[Gumball and Darwin take the bag out but when they are nearly at the bin they realised that they have been tricked]
Gumball: We are just taking out the trash, aren't we?
Darwin: Yeah.
[Richard is taking a nap on the sofa and Gumball and Darwin returns]
Gumball: Dad!
Richard: Oh, wh--
Gumball: You tricked us! That was no game.
Richard: Sorry! I've got a medical condition called laziness.
Gumball: Yeah? Well, from now on, we're gonna be the lazy ones.
Darwin: [Assents] Hmph!
Richard: [Laughs] I'll tell you what. If you can find anyone lazier than me in this town, I'll do your chores for a whole day. And if you lose... [quickly] you'll do mine for the rest of your life! How's that sound?
Gumball and Darwin: [Hesitate for a moment] Hmm... sounds pretty fair.
Richard: Okay, then. Let the lazy-off begin!
Lazy-Off: Eating Contest
[Richard, Gumball and Darwin are watching TV, Richard is eating potato chips]
Announcer: Ike Hitcher meets Rod Ironknuckle fist to fist. Thumb-wrestling federation tonight at nine o'clock.
Darwin: What do we do?
Gumball: We just do everything dad does.
[Richard eats a cookie, they do the same; Richard drinks soda, they do the same again]
Gumball: [Groan] He just never stops.
[Gumball and Darwin burp]
Darwin: Hey, you got a little something on your face.
Gumball: [Taps his face] Where?
Darwin: [Slaps him] There!
Gumball: Ow!
Darwin: [His arms start shivering] Sorry! I-I don't know what's happening to me! I'm all tingly!
Gumball: Eh, me too, buddy! What's going on? [His heart starts beating strongly]
[Inside Gumball's body, we can see sugar cubes tickling his heart]
Sugar Cubes: [Singing] Everywhere you look and everywhere you go Sugar, sugar, sugar from your head to your toe. When you've eaten lots of sugar and you've had too much Watch out, everybody, it's a sugar rush. Watch out, everybody, it's a sugar rush.
Gumball's Heart: [In a low voice] It tickles!
[Scene changes back to the living room]
Gumball: [In a high voice, he and Darwin are running in place] Dad! We need a timeout. We're gonna find someone else to beat you.
Richard: Sure. But I have to warn you -- I'm invincible! [Laughs and then falls asleep]
Gumball: Come on, Darwin! Let's go!
[Instead of opening the door, they tear it down, and leave quickly in a trail of fire]
Who's Lazy Larry?
[Gumball and Darwin pass by the senior citizens, then they stop and reverse back]
Gumball: [He speaks rapidly, specifically twice as fast] Excuse me? We need to find someone to beat our dad in a lazy-off. Is there anyone you can think of that can beat him in a lazy-off?
Donald: What did he say?
Marvin: He's just saying he needs to find a guy to beat his pop in a lazy-off.
Betty​: How about Lazy Larry?
Gumball: Who's Lazy Larry?
Donald: It's a long story, son, that goes way back to the summer of eighty-three.
[A flashback was going to start but Gumball and Darwin interrupt it by experiencing a a sugar low]
Darwin: What's happening?
Gumball: I don't know.
[Inside Gumball's body, we can see his heart sad and alone]
Gumball's Heart: Everything was fast, now everything is slow. I'm all alone in my sugar low. Where did everybody go?! [Echo]
[Scene changes back to the outside]
Marvin: Never mind. Just go and see Lazy Larry. He works at the convenience store.
Gumball and Darwin: [As they leave] Thank you, senior citizens.
Donald: What did he say?
Asking Larry
[Larry is working as a cashier at "Food N' Stuff", Gumball and Darwin approach him]
Larry: Hello, there, valued costumers.
Gumball: Are you Lazy Larry?
Larry: [Nervously] Uh, uh, no! Uhh, uh, no Lazy Larrys here. [Chuckles nervously] N-No.
Gumball: [At the loudspeaker] Will Lazy Larry please come to the checkout? Lazy --
Larry: [Grabs the microphone, whispers at it] No one calls me that anymore. I stopped being Lazy Larry years ago.
Gumball: [Grabs microphone] How come?
Larry: [Grabs microphone] Well, [Releases it] it all goes back to the summer of eighty-three...
Gumball: Can you just tell it quickly?
Larry: Yeah, sure. I was the laziest guy in Elmore until I lost my title to Richard Watterson.
[Gumball and Darwin gasp]
Larry: That guy is lazier than a rock.
Gumball: But, Larry, we need you to beat our dad in a lazy-off.
Larry: I'm sorry, kids, but I'm not that guy anymore. I've got a car now a-and a great new house and a girlfriend, who I'm gonna marry. So, thank you for shopping at Food n' Stuff and please go home now. [Looks back] Hello, there, valued -- [Realises Gumball and Darwin are there] Aah!

Gumball and Darwin: Please do it, Larry!
Larry: [Desperate] No! No! No! Noooo! [Notices that the customer is still there] Oh, uh, sorry, ma'am. That's thirty-nine cents.
[The customer opens her purse, Gumball and Darwin come out of it]
Gumball and Darwin: Please do it, Larry!
Larry: Leave me alone!!
[The client loses all her "hair"]
Food N' Stuff Boss: Shouting at customers, Needlemeyer? Gonna have to let you go.
[Larry is thrown out of the shop, Gumball and Darwin are there]
Gumball: Now that you don't have a job anymore, will you come do our lazy-off?
Larry: No!
[Larry is driving his car through the speedway]
Larry: [Sighs] Finally lost them. [Turns on the radio]
Broadcaster: This one goes out to Larry Needlemeyer from Gumball and Darwin.
Gumball and Darwin: [Singing] Please do it, Larry, please do it, Lar--
Larry: Aaah! [Turns off the radio; looks through the rear view mirror, Gumball and Darwin are on the back seats]
Gumball and Darwin: Please do it, Larry.

[The car falls off a cliff and explodes, Larry looks at it]
Larry: My car.
Gumball and Darwin: Please do it, Larry!
Larry: [In anger] Aaaaah!
[Larry arrives at the "Dump's Cave" restaurant, Karen is waiting for him]
Larry: Hi, honey. [Sits] There's... something I've been meaning to ask you. [Opens a ring box]
Karen: Yes, Laurence?
Larry: Would you...
Gumball and Darwin: Please do it, Larry! Please do it, Larry! [They hold signs, saying "PLEASE LARRY"]
Larry: Get out of my life! [He throws a cup, a bottle of ketchup, a bottle of mustard, a plate of spaghetti, a soda can, and a chair at Karen in anger]
Karen: I can take a hint, Laurence. [Runs away, crying]
Gumball and Darwin: Please do it, Larry!
Larry: [Returns back to his house] Ugh. I can't believe it. She -- she threw me out. [Throws briefcase and takes a seat on the couch]
[Gumball and Darwin hand Larry a slice of pizza and a remote controller and place a soda drinking hat on his head. Larry sips from the hat and becomes larger]
Gumball: So, now that you've lost everything, will you come do our lazy-off?
[Larry makes an awkward sound]
Gumball and Darwin: Yea, Larry! High-five! We're back in the game! Let's go!
[Gumball and Darwin run out of the room]
Timeout Ends
[Richard is snoring on the couch and Gumball awakens him]
Richard: Huh? Well, that was a pretty long timeout.
Gumball: Yeah, but now we've got somebody who can beat you -- Lazy Larry.
Richard: Lazy Larry, huh? Why, that's a name I haven't heard since the summer of eighty-three --
Gumball: Aw, nobody cares about the summer of eighty-three!
Richard: Sorry. So, where is he?
Gumball and Darwin: Here! Huh?
Gumball: What the --
[Calls up Larry. Larry's voice mail comes on]
Larry's Voicemail: In a lazy tone Hi. This is Lazy Larry...
Gumball: Hey, Larry, it's G--
[Gumball realizes it's his voice mail]
Larry's Voicemail: [In a lazy tone] I'm home, but I'm too lazy to pick up the phone. [Richard chuckles] Don't bother leaving a message, 'cause I-- [Mumbling and the phone beeps]
Gumball: He's not coming.

Lazy-Off: Yawning Contest
[Gumball, Darwin, and Richard take a seat on the couch]
Richard: [Yawns]
Gumball: [Yawns]
Richard: [Yawns bigger]
Gumball: [Yawns bigger]
Richard: [Yawns even bigger]
Gumball: [Yawns even bigger and breaks his jaw]
Richard: Everything all right, son?
Gumball: [Still in his yawning position] Uh-huh.
Richard: Good. Just checking.
[Gumball, Darwin and Richard are sitting on the couch looking wrinkled then Darwin's stomach rumbles]
Darwin: I'm hungry.
Richard: Me too. I think I'll have a slice of pizza.
Gumball: But if you move, you lose.
Richard: Who said anything about moving? [Blows on the notepad, causing a pen to roll and drop, pushing the skateboard to hit a chair, and the chair leans the edge of the pizza box, catapulting the pizza slice onto Richard's face and Richard sucks the pizza slice into his mouth. Richard chuckles while Gumball and Darwin watched in amazement]
Gumball: Don't worry, buddy. watch this. [Blows on the notepad, causing a paper to fly off and land somewhere, causing a chain of unknown events. Gumball opens his mouth, hoping food would fall in. A toaster then hits Darwin and knocks him out of the couch]

Gumball: Sorry, buddy!
Richard: [Laughing] Looks like it's just you and me.
Gumball vs. Richard
[Gumball and Richard are still sitting on the couch]

Monster Truck Rally Announcer: Live monster truck rally! [A Monster Truck is shown crushing cars]
Gumball: Monster trucks. That'll take my mind off it.
Richard: We'll see about that. Darwin?
Darwin: Uh-huh?
Richard: [In a hypnotizing voice while wriggling his fingers] Change channels for Dad!
[Darwin looks hypnotized]
Gumball: No, Darwin! [In a hypnotizing voice while wriggling his arms] Don't change channels for Dad!
[Darwin looks normal again]
Richard: No! [In a hypnotizing voice while wriggling his fingers again] Do change channels for Dad!
Darwin: [In a hypnotizing voice while wriggling his fins] Stop telling me what to do. [Changes back to normal voice] It's confusing!
Richard: Oh, okay, then. I'll just use my supernatural powers. [Tries to surge up his "natural powers"]
[TV channel changes to the weather channel]
Darwin: Aaah! [Runs upstairs] Paranormal activity!
Richard: [Laughing] Ha ha ha! [Surges up]
[TV channel changes to the shopping channel]
Gumball: Oh, no! Not the shopping channel! [Sweats nervously] I hate it! [Grunts] Boring! [Grunts] [In a squeaky voice] Can't... take it! [Returns to normal voice] Must... change... channel! [Surges up and the button of his pants flies off and hits the TV button in slow motion, changing the channel back to the Monster Truck Rally. Richard watches in amazement] Ha!
Richard: Ugh! [Hears the car pulling up outside and smiles deviously] Well, son, [Gets up from the couch] seems like the apple didn't fall too far from the tree. You're pretty lazy, my boy. [Walks away with the remote attached between his butt cheeks and push the remote between his butt cheeks to change the channel]

Nicole: Gumball Watterson! [The colorful background disappears] You should be ashamed of yourselves! Fooling around as your poor father slaves away!
Richard: [Vacuuming, looking tired and talks in a lighter voice] When will it ever end?
Gumball: But, Mom --
Nicole: No! I don't want to hear another word. Get off the sofa. [Gumball and Darwin get off the sofa and walk away] Get on with the chores and give your dad a rest.
Richard: [Holds his back in pain and talks in a lighter voice] Ohhh, my back!
Nicole: You've done enough today, my little fluffy soldier. [Holds Richards cheeks] I don't want you to move another muscle.
Richard: Ohhh, thank you, honey.
Chore Duty
[At the living room]
Gumball: [Vacuuming towards Richard, hitting his foot while Richard is sitting on the sofa asleep] You mind moving your feet?
[Darwin is cleaning up the table with a towel]
Richard: [Wakes up] Hm? Unh-unh. You heard what mom said.
Gumball: [Sighs]
[Darwin moves and lifts up Richard's feet and Gumball vacuums under Richard's feet]
[Richard laughs and sighs. The episode ends]
