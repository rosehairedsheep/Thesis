Too Much Television
[Darwin and Gumball are sitting on the couch watching TV, eating chips, their eyes are red from watching too much TV]
Darwin: Can you think of any better way to spend our lives?
Gumball: Dude, I can't even think. Is my heart still beating?
[Darwin checks if Gumball's heart is beating and they get worried, because it doesn't seem to be. Luckily, in a couple of seconds it starts beating]
Gumball and Darwin: [Sigh]
Gumball: Keep flicking.
[The following words are heard as they switch channels]
TV message: Listen! [Darwin switches TV channel] Gum! [Again] Ball! [Again] The world... [again] will end in 24 hours, so... [Last switch] look for the signs! [Gumball and Darwin look surprised]
Gumball: Hmm. That was strange. [Looks at Darwin]
Darwin: Yeah.
Gumball: [As if nothing happened] Keep flicking.
[Darwin switches channels again]
The Near End of the World
[Gumball and Darwin are sitting in the bus, suddenly they hear Gary screaming]
Gary: The end is near! The end is near! The end is near! The end is near!
[Gumball and Darwin look at each other worriedly as the bus leaves]
Gary: The end is near! For our discount sale, so hurry up!
[Gumball and Darwin are sitting on a bench while eating their sandwiches, suddenly a flock of birds flies by]
Gumball: That's weird. Where do you think all those birds are going?
Anton: [Sings happily, but slowly stops and looks at the birds around him] What? [Fearful] You want my sandwich? Here. You can have it. [Throws the sandwich to the birds; one of the birds eats it] Please let me go!
[All the birds fly to Anton and he screams]
Gumball: Okay, there's something going on here.
Darwin: Yeah, first there was this weird message from the TV.
Gumball: Then the weird guy with his sign.
Darwin: And now the animals are acting weird. What's going on?
Bobert: Greetings, organic units. Would you be interested in signing up for the science club excursion to watch the solar eclipse in exactly 24 hours?
Gumball and Darwin: 24 hours?
Gumball: What exactly happens in a solar eclipse?
Bobert: The sun will be engulfed by the moon and the world will be thrust into complete and unnatural darkness.
Gumball: Whoa! And, uh, is this going to be, like, like a bad thing?
Bobert: Well, the Mayans believed that it would signify the end of the world. But of course, that was before the advent of science.
Gumball and Darwin: The end of the world!
Bobert: Yes, but obviously it is just primitive nonsense.
Gumball and Darwin: In 24 hours!
Bobert: Please, let me finish.
Gumball and Darwin: We're doomed! Doomed! [Both run away scared]
Bobert: [Looks how they leave] I'll take that as a yes.
Preparing for The End
[24:00:00]
Gumball: 24 hours?! Oh, this is horrible! All the things I wanted to do in my life, all my plans... ruined! Ruined! [falls on his knees and sorrows deeply]
Darwin: You know, I've been thinking. 24 hours is actually quite a long time.
Gumball: [Perks up] Hey, you're right. I mean, how many minutes are there in an hour? Like, 60? So, that's like 60 times 24, which is... three billion seconds!
Darwin: That's like ages!
Gumball: We've got to make every second count. You know, Darwin, I've never asked you -- but what do you wanna do with your life? What are your hopes and dreams? Who is Darwin Watterson?
Darwin: [Dreamily] Well, I guess what makes me happy is helping other people who are less fortunate than ourselves due to circumstances beyond their control. So, I'd like to start a charity for --
[Gumball goes away bored by Darwin's words]
Darwin: Where are you going?
Gumball: Dude, I don't think the end of the world is time to get charitable. And besides, you were getting kinda boring. I think we'd be better off doing some of the things I wanna do. [Continues walking away]
[22:42:52. Gumball's classroom]
Gumball: Pbbt! Darwin, what are we doing here?
Darwin: Learning hard, so we can get a career, a home, and feed our children in the future.
Gumball: Darwin! There is no future! We need to make the most of it right now! Not listening to some baboon drone on about algebra!
Penny: [Whispers to Gumball] Uh, Gumball, this is biology.
Gumball: Oh, who cares?! It won't matter in 24 hours! Kiss me, Penny.
Lucy Simian: Ahem! I’ve got a surprise for you today, children! A surprise test! [Laughs and puts a piece of paper on Gumball’s desk]
[Gumball takes the paper and heads to Miss Simian’s table]
Gumball: Well, I got a surprise for you! I’m not gonna do the test because... [Rips up the paper] it’s the end of the world and nothing matters anymore! Not even this! [Grabs the glass of water from Miss Simian's table and splashes the water on her face] How's that for a surprise! [Jumps on Miss Simian’s table very excited] So come on, everybody, let’s turn our last day on earth into the biggest party ever!
Darwin: [Jumps on his chair and supports Gumball] Whoo! [The other students stay put and only do the test] Whoo! [Still no reaction] Whoo?
[Miss Simian gets wrathful. Gumball grins nervously]
[22:10:12. School's Hallway. Both Gumball and Darwin have finished their detention]
Gumball: Okay, on second thought, spending three hours on detention wasn't the best use of our time. [Checks his watch] I'm gonna be late for my wedding now.
Darwin: Wedding?
Gumball: Yes, Darwin. My wedding.
[Gumball and Penny are getting "married," Banana Joe is the parson, Darwin and Masami are their godparents and Molly and Carmen are the witnesses]
Banana Joe: By the power of the banana, it is my duty to ask if there's anyone here who has any reason why Gumball and Penny should not be joined in marriage. [Raises hand] Speak now, or forever hold your peace.
Penny: Actually, I've got more than one reason. Firstly, I'm 12 and so are you. Secondly, you didn't even propose to me. You're just trying to marry me in the school corridor.
Tobias​​​​​​: [Passing by] Hey, guys! Happy wedding!
Penny: And finally, this is not a wedding ring. It's a bagel. You know what? That shouldn't stop you from asking me again in 20 years. [Kisses Gumball on his cheek and leaves]
Darwin: [Gasps] But you don't have 20 years.
Gumball: [Serious] Shh. I love her too much to let her know the truth. [Cheerful, to Carmen] Hey, wanna get married?
[Carmen is shocked]
The Wattersons'
[13:02:58]
[The whole family is having lunch, Gumball has a perm, Anais looks at him confused]
Anais: Gumball, why do you have a perm?
Gumball: It's just something I've always wanted to do. So, Mom, under normal circumstances, how long do you reckon I'm going to live for?
Nicole: Well, your grandfather lived to be 102. So I wouldn't worry, sweetie.
Gumball: Hmm, that's at least 90 more birthday presents. Mom, I'd like to make you an offer you can't refuse. I wanna combine all of my birthday presents in one manageable lump present... [Cheerfully] so can I have a pony after dinner?!
[Anais laughs]
Gumball: [Serious] What are you laughing at?
Anais: Nothing. Do you want a tutu with that?
[Anais and Darwin laugh]
Nicole: If I get you a pony, you'd get bored of it in a day.
Gumball: Not an issue.
Nicole: Okay, I'll get you a pony...
Gumball: Thank you! Finally!
Nicole: As soon as your father starts laying golden eggs.
Richard: I haven't given up yet! [Tries, everyone looks at him]
Gumball: All right. I was going to spare you guys, but okay. This morning, the TV spoke to me. And here's what it said. "Dark times are upon us. [He relates it to the family, everyone looks at him puzzled but Darwin who nods in agreement] It burns everything it touches to ash." So, basically, there's gonna be the solar eclipse, and... it's gonna be the end of the world.
[Anais and Nicole laugh and leave]
Gumball: [Grunts] No one believes us.
Richard: [Angrily hits the table] Have you tried to do something about it?!
Darwin: Well, Gumball got a perm and tried to get married. I mostly ate ice cream on a roller coaster.
Richard: [Puts his hands on his head] That's not what I'm talking about. We need to plan our survival! "Apoclatips" or not, the Wattersons will live on!
Getting the Supplies
[05:03:55. Richard, Gumball and Darwin are in the family car]
Richard: Come on, come on! We need to go faster!
[Richard is pushing the accelerator but the car doesn't move]
Gumball: Uh, Dad, I think you need to take the handbrake off.
Richard: Good idea! [He takes it off, the car crashes into the Robinsons' car at the back]
Gumball: Dad, you're in reverse.
Richard: Correct! [Changes gear, crashes into the car at the front] Let's walk!
[Gumball, Richard and Darwin are running to the supermarket with a shopping cart]
Richard: First thing to do in an emergency is to panic and buy everything you can!
Security Guard: Hey, no running in the supermarket.
Richard: Okay, let's race walk!
[Richard, Gumball and Darwin are race walking along one of the supermarket corridors]
Darwin: This is pretty effective.
Richard: Well, it's an Olympic event, you know. [They stop] Now, you grab as much food as possible
[The three of them fill the cart with food]
[04:16:13. They arrive to the checkout line, but there are a lot of people]
Richard: Aah! Queue! We don't have time for that!
Gumball: Look, Dad, the self-service aisle.
[03:57:21. Richard tries to scan a can of corn]
Machine: Unexpected items in the bagging area.
[Tries again]
Machine: Please try scanning it more slowly.
[Tries again]
Machine: Insufficient scanning speed. Please try scanning faster. [Richard tries again] A little bit faster. [Does it again] A little bit faster. [And again] A little bit faster. [And again] Scan successful.
Richard: Yes!
Machine: Item unrecognized.
[Richard angrily throws the can at the machine, but it bounces back and hits his head]
Richard: Ow!
Machine: Unexpected item in cranium area. Please rescan.
[He does it]
Machine: Insufficient scanning speed.
Richard: [Screaming] Aaaaah!
[03:57:23. The trio leaves the supermarket race walking, then the security guard notices them]
Security Guard: Hey, come back here! You didn't pay for that!
[The trio throws the money at him]
The Bunker
[00:57:23. The whole family is in the back garden]
Anais: [Off-screen] Dad, is this really necessary?
Richard: [Off-screen] Absolutely. In every disaster movie I've ever seen, the family survives by hiding in a bunker.
Nicole: [Off-screen] Richard, that's not a bunker. It's a toilet.
Richard: [Off-screen] Come on, guys. Think outside the box. This has got everything we need! A toilet. Uh...
Gumball: [Off-screen] I don't think we're all going to fit in there.
Richard: [Off-screen] We have to!
[The scene changes to the Wattersons inside the "bunker," where they are packed like sardines]
Anais: Dad, for the last time, there won't be any apocalypse. It's just an eclipse.
Richard: "Apocalytips", apoc-eclipse. It's all the same, smarty pants.
Nicole: I think this might be easier if we left the TV outside.
[The camera goes down, revealing the TV playing a wrestling match, and goes back up]
Richard: Nicole, you're describing a world I do not wish to live in. I'll sacrifice myself.
Nicole: Look, honey, why don't you and the boys stay in here and keep acting like complete lunatics, while Anais and I sit outside and watch the eclipse.
Gumball and Darwin: [Gasp] Noooo!
[The boys get out the toilet and quickly close the door]
Nicole: [Off-screen] Boys, what do you think you're doing?
Gumball: We're sacrificing ourselves for your survival! After the apocalypse, you guys will have to repopulate the earth.
Darwin: Tell the children of the future of our heroism, our sacrifice!
Gumball: And our perm!
Gumball and Darwin: We love you!
[They leave]
Nicole: [Off-screen] Gumball Watterson, come back here immediately! I'm not spending the afternoon in a toilet!
The End
[00:00:33. Gumball and Darwin are sitting on the roof of the house]
Gumball: This is it, buddy.
Darwin: I'm proud to spend my last moments with you, Gumball.
Gumball: Me too. [They embrace each other] Here it comes.
[A huge shadow starts to cover the city, everyone who sees it is impressed]
The Moon: [Passing in front of the Sun] Duuude, you just got mooned!
The Sun: What is wrong with that guy?
[Gumball and Darwin are shocked because they didn't expect that]
Darwin: That was a bit anticlimactic.
Gumball: Yeah, but at least we've learned something today... that every moment of our life should be lived to the fullest because it can be very long or very short, my friend.
Darwin: That is very true, Gumball. So what do you wanna do now?
Gumball: Mmm. TV?
Darwin: Yeah.
[The scene cuts to the toilet]
Nicole: [Tries to open the door] Richard, do something!
Richard: [Off-screen] Don't worry, girls! I've been in this situation before! I'm going to kick the door open!
[Richard tries to kick the door, but they all fall over and toilet water splashes on them]
Nicole and Anais: [Off-screen] EWW!
Richard: [Off-screen] Yep, that's exactly what happened last time!
