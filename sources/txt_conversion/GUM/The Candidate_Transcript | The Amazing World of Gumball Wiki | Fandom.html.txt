Catastrophe
[The episode starts in front of the door of the art room as vocalized music plays. Several students, wildly battling each other, crash through the door. Tobias tackles Bobert, while Clare jumps onto Sarah. This leads to complete chaos, as flames and ruins are scattered all over the lockers]
Anais: Wait! Stop!
Bobert: [To Tobias] Give up. You have a two percent chance of defeating me. [Tobias hits him with one of the locker doors] You have a four percent chalice of repeating me. [Tobias hits him again] You have a squirrel chocolate geography hairbrush.
[Bobert collapses in error. Tobias screams in triumph and runs off-screen]
Anais: [Appearing from background] Wait, we have to work together!
[As Sarah throws her head at Clare, everything freezes. Gumball walks into frame, addressing the viewer]
Gumball: They say lions throw their cubs off ravines and only raise the ones strong enough to climb back up. Well, firstly, that's not true, and it's also completely irrelevant to the story, but it makes for a cool opening. You might be wondering how things got to this point. It all started yesterday evening. I remember it as if it were yesterday... evening.
Before the Charity Ball
[Rewind to the previous day, with the Wattersons in their car. However, the Watterson children are completely annoyed by their arrival to the Charity Ball]
Gumball: Why do we have to go back to school?! We already wasted the whole day there!
Nicole: How can someone be so grumpy going to a charity ball, especially when it's about building a better future for children?
Gumball: Yeah, one chocolate fountain at a time.
Richard: How are we supposed to raise awareness for the children of tomorrow if we have low blood sugar today?
Gumball: Maybe your generation should have thought about our future before ruining the economy.
Darwin: And the environment.
Anais: And the education system!
Gumball: And ruining Chatsnap by following their kids! Not related, but I think it should be said.
Richard: You think we had it easy? When I finished high school, all I had was three dollars in my pocket. So, what did I do? I bought a house, a car, and started a family. And the other two dollars went into my savings.
Gumball: You guys just don't realize, do you?
Richard: I realize that, in spite of how self-entitled my kids are, I still have space in my heart to think about their future.
Gumball: More like space in your stomach for free prawn cocktails and fruit punch.
Anais: And if you really care about us, why do we have to be stuck in a room with some bargain-bin VHS tape, while you animals party like it's nineteen-ninety-nine B.C.?
Nicole: For your information, it will be a very formal and civilized evening.
Children's Future Ball
[Cut to the aftermath of the Children's Future Ball: all the parents and teachers seem to all be sleeping in an ironically uncivilized and informal manner; Richard is then shown to be laid out on a giant plate with a roasted pig in his mouth, poking out every time he snores. During the scene, loud rock music plays in the background]
Voice: I'm gonna rock you till you do the rock 'n' roll— do the rock 'n' roll— do the rock 'n' roll— do the rock 'n' roll— do the rock 'n' roll—
[In the art room, a crudely animated music video for children plays on a television]
Voice: [On television] Thirty-two donkeys playing on a sled,
One fell off it and hurt his leg
Santa called the doctor, and the doctor said,
"No more donkeys playing on that sled!"
Thirty-three donkeys playing on a sled...
[All the students whose parents are contributing to the charity ball are shown to be completely exhausted]
Gumball: This has to stop!
Darwin: Really? Don't you want to see what happens to the thirty-second gosh-DARN DONKEY?!
Gumball: At least it's a distraction.
[The television turns itself off with a remote placed against its head, suggesting a method of "killing itself." In response, Gumball screams to an insane extent, and with overwhelming tears, knocks repeatedly on the door]
Gumball: Let us out! Let us out! [Cries in vain and lets out an abundance of tears]
Darwin: [Walks up to Gumball, holding a phone up to detect a signal] Still no signal. There must be some way to open that door.
Gumball: I've tried everything— turning the handle clockwise, turning it counterclockwise, not turning it, staring at it for a while... [Eyes become watery] ...telling you about it.
Darwin: [Sweating] I'm more worried about the heat. Is it me, or is the room getting globally much warmer?
[Nicole is shown to be unconsciously blowing her party horn, which, upon extending, presses the button of the thermostat, which increases the temperature at high intervals]
Gumball: [Sweating] Meh, seems fine to me. I'm hungry.
[Gumball goes to the table to get a cookie, and as he does, the sweat of his steps evaporate instantly. As Gumball is about to eat the cookie, Tobias slaps it away from his hand]
Tobias​​​: Okay, I'd like to point out that, as my parents paid for half of this fundraiser, ninety percent of that cookie belongs to me.
Anais: That's not how math works.
Tobias​​​: Check your textbook.
Anais: [Searches for a fraction section in the textbook] Fractions, fractions... ah! "Half always equals whatever Tobias wants"? What?! [Flips textbook to reveal the back] "This textbook was generously funded by the Wilson family"?!
Tobias​​​: I'll look after that. [Eats the whole cookie]
[Gumball and Anais sigh]
Tobias​​​: Mm-mm. [Spits out a crumb, representing Gumball's portion] You're welcome.
Anais: That's not fair! Who knows how long we're gonna be stuck in here for? We need to apportion our resources equally.
Idaho: "Apportion resources equally"? Sounds to me like highfalutin' city garble to keep all the food for yourselves! You should do what we simple countryfolk call "good old-fashioned equitable distribution of commodities."
Anais: What?
Clare: [Sighs loudly] Yeah, Anais, you think you're so woke, but if you truly cared about the cause, you'd be giving that food to the endangered trees of the Amazon.
Anais: [Even more puzzled] Wha— what?
Banana Joe: Wake up, sheeple! It's the other people we should worry about, coming through that door and stealing our food!
Anais: The door's locked, Joe. That's the main part of our problem.
Banana Joe: Not according to my sources.
Anais: And where are you getting your information from?
Banana Joe: [Pulls out phone] Www (dot) neckbeardfrogalternativetruth (dot) ru. I'm too clever to let myself get manipulated by the lamestream media— which brings me to my next problem.
Sarah: [Holding her head melting from the heat] How you'll never find love and end up marrying an anime pillow?
Banana Joe: No, that's number three. I meant I think I'm coming down with some weird disease. The doctor said my heart's gone black, and my bad breath may be due to my soul rotting.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​: Well, there isn't much to discuss about that food anyway. It already belongs to me!
[Tobias, Gumball, Idaho, Anais, Banana Joe, Sarah, and Clare argue against each other]
Darwin: GUYS! Shouldn't we focus on the rising temperature? It's kind of boiling in here...
[Felix collapses as he "sheds" his shell, due to being boiled]
Darwin: ...Literally.
Bobert: I concur. If the temperature continues to rise at this rate, in three hours, this room will be lit.
Gumball: Sounds pretty good!
Bobert: I mean, literally on fire; it is a scientific fact.
Banana Joe: Bobert, facts are like stars—
Anais: They're always in the sky, but you can't always see them.
Banana Joe: No, they're like shiny holes in the dark light of my ignorance, and I don't like 'em!
Anais: [Sighs] Okay, guys, what are we going to do about the food?
Gumball: Mmm... fight?
[All the students except Anais chatter in agreement and clash together, split in a parallel line formation, wildly assailing each other. Leslie yells and launches his own pot, which ends up causing him to fly off as well. Tobias and Gumball, fighting, are suddenly frightened by the projectile launch. Banana Joe and Hot Dog Guy come on-screen, fighting each other. After they battle on the floor, they end up with Hot Dog Guy wearing Banana Joe's peel and arms, and Banana Joe wearing Hot Dog Guy's buns and arms. Banana Joe manipulates the disconnected peel to close, trapping and crushing Hot Dog Guy inside, and laughs in triumph, only to be beat up by Hot Dog Guy's arms. Clare and Sarah enter, with Clare biting and crushing Sarah's head to the extent where the some of the ice cream launches out of her end, resulting in a fart noise. Clare then gets off and slips on the spilled ice cream. Anais reacts in horror. Alan enters, pulling Colin by the foot]
Colin: Let me go!
[Bobert randomly shoots with his laser, causing Anais to duck. Idaho cries in battle and ends up being grabbed by Gumball to be thrown. Anais finally cries out, stopping everyone except Idaho, who keeps spinning in midair]
Anais: STO-OP! How about we hold an election to choose a leader?
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​: Yeah.
Colin: Yeah.
Alan​​​​​​​​​​: Fine by me.
Gumball: All right, I'm cool with that.
Bobert: Yes, that's fair.
[Everyone, except Idaho, calmly gather together]
Idaho: [Still spinning] Uh, fellas, what about— uh, uh, can someone give me a hand? I, uh— okay, I'm gonna pass out. I— I— I'm passing out. Uh, ah, gone. [Passes out]
Democracy
[Anais and Tobias are made candidates in the debate. As they are both standing behind podiums ready to convince the others to vote for them, Anais delivers her own speech first]
Anais: My slogan is easy to understand: "Vote for progressive distribution, not regressive attribution."
Banana Joe: That's about as easy to understand as a Scottish scatman wearing a diving helmet!
All others: Yeah!
Tobias​​​​​​​​: Exactly. My slogan is much clearer: "Vote for me [Under breath] ​​​​​I'll keep everything for myself." [Smiles]
Clare: That sounds as fishy as your best friend's boyfriend liking your Chatsnap photos at three in the morning!
All others: Yeah!
Banana Joe: And enough with the blah-blah and the politricks. It's forcing me to think, and thinking makes me angry!
[The others angrily comment on the subject, in a mob-like manner]
Anais: Guys, please calm down!
Darwin: Can we at least talk about the temperature? It's so hot in here, the saliva in my mouth is starting to bubble! We need to—
[Darwin hallucinates that he is in a tropical island and runs around, laughing; then falls to the floor. The arguing students notice and stop for a moment, then return their verbal debate]
Colin: I demand change! Change! Change!
All others: [Following his words] Change! Change! Change!
Anais: But I'm offering you change!
Idaho: Yeah, but it's the same change as before!
Anais: But nobody else is more competent than me to take us through these hard times!
Banana Joe: Enough with the competent people doing nothing! We want incompetent people doing something!
Idaho: The people are craving hope!
Gumball: [Stomping on Idaho] Did somebody call for a "raving dope"?
Anais: What? No, they said—
Gumball: The people have spoken! If they want a slack-jawed bozo to take charge, then I shall be their champion. [Goes to the podium]
Tobias​​​​​​​​: But I— [Is pushed off by Gumball]
Gumball: You want change?!
Others: Yeah!
Gumball: Tired of fancy words?!
Others: Yeah!
Gumball: How about this for a slogan?! [Makes an incomprehensible assortment of various sounds while making various expressions]
Others: [Short pause] Yeah! [Applause]
Banana Joe: He's just saying what we're all thinking!
Darwin: But what will you do about the temperature?!
Gumball: There's no problem with the temperature.
Darwin: Just look at yourself!
Gumball: [Revealed to presumably be wearing only his underwear] It's not hotter. It's just less cold.
Darwin: Dude! Your head is literally on fire!
Gumball: [Revealed to have his head on fire] No, it's not.
[In response to the fire, the roof sprinklers shoot water below, extinguishing the flame]
Gumball: See?
[Darwin gasps when a puddle forms in front of him and tries to gather up to drink water as much as he can. However, it instantly evaporates, and Darwin wells up tears, which also evaporate]
Anais: Okay, listen, you can vote for me, and I promise I'll do my best to get us out of this situation. Or you can vote for some loon in his underpants who doesn't even know the meaning of the adversity we're all facing!
Gumball: Pbht, I know exactly what "vardersity" means.
[Anais raises her eyebrow in skepticism]
Gumball: [Reading a dictionary] Oh, what do you know? Turns out it's not some kind of dance.
Anais: [Sighs] Please, this is serious! Vote, and vote wisely. Our future— everyone's future— depends on it!
[The students seem to fully interpret Anais' message; however, Gumball ends up being the most voted, as he is shown taking the oath of leader]
Gumball: [With his hand on the book] I, Gumball T. Watterson, do solemnly swear that I will execute the office of leader of this group...
Anais: In their desire for change, the people forgot that they could get short-changed.
Darwin: But he's only one guy. I mean, how much harm can he—
Catastrophe and Remedy
[The scene then returns to the beginning of the episode, with the students fighting each other exactly as seen before]
Anais: Wait, stop!
[Everything freezes as Gumball comes on-screen to speak to the viewer again]
Gumball: And that brings us back to now. I know they'll blame me, but it was once said that the higher we soar, the smaller we appear to salty little people who can't fly, [Gradually becoming furious] 'cause they're losers, and therefore, blaming me for every little thing, even though they kind of elected you in the first place—
Anais: [Interrupting] Gumball...
[Everything resumes as the students continue to fight each other]
Anais: What are you doing?
Gumball: I'm dictating my memoir. What do you think of the title? "An Eagle Amongst Pigeons."
Anais: This is not the time!
Gumball: Fine! [Dictating in a poetic manner] He said confidently, the flickering light reflected in his fierce, imperious eyes—
Anais: Gumball, you're responsible for the whole school falling apart! Now it's time to get your people back together!
Gumball: [Sighs] All right, fine. [Runs and climbs up a pile of thrown items to build height] Everybody, stop!
[As his voice sounds out through the whole area, the students stop in response; Idaho unfortunately has been thrown and now spins in midair again]
Idaho: Oh, come on.
Gumball: In these troubled times, a true leader must take it upon himself to unify his people. Maybe what you need is a common enemy, someone to take the blame for the greater good.
[Anais nods to him. In response, he nods back]
Gumball: And it is my duty to inform you that enemy... [Inhales] is Anais.
Anais: What?!
Gumball: What? You just nodded. I thought that meant you were cool with it.
[Anais groans]
Gumball: [Sighs] Anyone else want to take the blame?
[The students are then shown running through the hallways]
Anais: Quick! It's so hot, the whole school's crumbling!
Gumball: [Following after the crowd, trapped in a pillory and covered with bruises and food, due to being the one who has taken the blame] Guys, wait for me!
[The students walk up to a unavoidably large hole on the floor and gasp]
Darwin: What are we gonna do?!
Anais: If we use everyone's skills, we could pull through this together!
[Tobias is shown throwing money at the hole]
Anais: Tobias? What are you doing?
Tobias​​​​​​​​: Throwing money at the problem.
Anais: Okay, money isn't the solution to every problem.
[The hole is entirely filled with money, fixing the problem]
Tobias​​​​​​​​: It is if you've got enough.
[The students run over the "bridge" of dollars. They then run through an overwhelming cloud of smoke and cough in reaction]
Clare: Wait! I've got this. Anais, say something clever.
Anais: Okay. We can eliminate the toxic particles in the smoke by creating a filtration system using our wet clothes—
[Clare groans exaggeratedly, causing an enormous wind to blow out most of the smoke]
Anais: Okay, rude.
Darwin: But effective.
[The crowd of students resume running through the corridors past the boiler, in which Darwin slows down to show his concern]
Darwin: Wait! What about the boiler?
Gumball: It's a boiler, Darwin! It boils! [Guides Darwin back to the group]
Anais: Quick! We're almost there!
[A large piece of the roof collapses upon Clare. Anais gasps]
Clare: My face!
Leslie​​​​​​​​: Don't worry, I'll fix this! [Does handwork on her face]
Anais: Of course! The natural healing properties of plants!
Leslie​​​​​​​​: [Reveals Clare's face with makeup] Uh, no, I mean she might not make it, but at least she'll go down on fleek.
[The school's verge to completely collapsing frightens the students]
Anais: Come on, quick!
[The students scream as they barely escape the overbearing dust cloud that results from the school collapsing]
Unsatisfying End
All: Yeah! [Celebrate their survival]
Banana Joe: We made it!
Anais: Yeah, but no thanks to them. [Points to the charity ball at the gymnasium]
[The charity ball is still revealed to be full of dormant parents; Banana Joe's parents are then shown playing with their mouths during their sleep]
Voice: Do the rock 'n' roll— do the rock 'n' roll— do the rock 'n' roll— do the rock 'n' roll— do the—
Gumball: That's right, Anais, it's all thanks to... me. I mean, if I hadn't seized power after lying to everyone and embezzled all the food and fuelled your differences until you hated each other and started a civil war in the school that almost led to your extinction, you guys wouldn't be here being all chummy.
Tobias​​: Oh, why, you little— [Throws Idaho]
Anais: Stop!
[Idaho once again spins continously]
Gumball: Yes, enough of this violence!
Anais: No, it's just that he was gonna miss.
[Anais readjusts Idaho to launch into Gumball's face, which he does, giving Gumball a black eye]
Anais: The important thing is we all worked together. It means there's still hope for the future. We can leave this school a better place than we—
[The school explodes, due to the lack of maintenance of the boiler, resulting in piles upon piles of flame-ridden debris. Gumball, Anais, and Darwin reemerge. Gumball and Anais have horrified and shocked expressions while Darwin looks at them angrily]
Darwin: Told you we should have done something about that overheating problem.
[Episode ends]
