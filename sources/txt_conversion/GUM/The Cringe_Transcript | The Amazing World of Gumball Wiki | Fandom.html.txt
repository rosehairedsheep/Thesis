Bathroom Cringe
[As the episode starts, Gumball whistles and gracefully dances along through Elmore Junior High. While chewing on some bubblegum, he enters the bathroom and finishes his whistling with a stance. Gumball then sees Hot Dog Guy in front of him. He quickly stops whistling and spits out his bubblegum, causing it to land on Hot Dog Guy. Hot Dog Guy removes the gum and tosses it to the ground]
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​: Umm, can I just...? [Points at the stall]
Gumball: Oh yeah, sorry. [Gumball shakes Hot Dog Guy's hand in a weird manner]
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​: Uh, right. I was just trying to get past but-
Gumball: Yeah. [Stops shaking Hot Dog Guy's hand] Right, well uh, [Finger guns Hot Dog Guy] Have a good one. [Takes a few steps backward]
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​: Sure. And you.
[Both of them walk backwards into a stall]
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​: Yeah.
[Gumball and Hot Dog Guy both take a deep breath and they close the doors to their respective stalls. The camera zooms in, showing only Gumball and Hot Dog Guy's feet, as they both talk to themselves]
Gumball: Okay relax, man. It's weird, but you can do this. Just focus on your breathing. [Takes deep, heavy breaths]
Hot Dog Guy​​​: Deep breaths. It will make the weirdness go away.
[As Hot Dog Guy tries to calm himself, Gumball hears his breathing]
Gumball: Oh man, I can hear his breathing. Just stay on it, Gumball. Relax harder! [Makes louder, heavier breaths]
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​​​: [Hears Gumball's loud breathing] What is he doing in there? Never mind, just inhale and exhale.
[Gumball and Hot Dog Guy both make loud, deep breaths, gradually increasing in volume, until their breathing becomes loud screaming. The two are then seen exiting the bathroom]
Gumball: Nope!
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​​​: Yep, not gonna happen.
[The school bell rings, and Gumball and Hot Dog Guy are shown trying to enter the bathroom. First, they both run for the bathroom, but then walk past it when they see each other. The second time they see each other, they both growl and pull out their phones. Gumball then is seen running for the bathroom, with Hot Dog Guy nowhere in sight]
Gumball: Oh, too early. [Walks away, then stops] No, wait!
[Gumball runs for the bathroom, but as soon as he does, Hot Dog Guy tries to enter at the same time. They both growl at each other]
Bathroom Montage
[At Gumball's class, Miss Simian presents a waterfall video]
Lucy Simian: [Off-screen] And then all the water flows over the edge, more water than you can ever imagine. So much water gushing and torrents of water then it floods into another river-
[A second screen appears, showing Gumball in agony as he holds his urine. A third screen appears, showing Hot Dog Guy watching Rocky mindlessly water the grass at the stadium. Another screen shows a close-up of Hot Dog Guy's face in agony.]
[In the boy's bathroom, Hot Dog Guy opens one of the ceiling tiles]
Hot Dog Guy​​: Oh, yeah. [Tries to drop into one of the cubicles as Gumball quickly enters the bathroom]
Gumball: Oh-ho, Yes!
[Gumball enters the cubicle just as Hot Dog Guy drops into it. The cubicle door slowly opens, revealing Hot Dog Guy has landed on Gumball, causing Gumball's head to go into the toilet bowl. Gumball and Hot Dog Guy angrily leave the bathroom in opposite directions.]
[Hot Dog Guy is seen in the school lab mixing chemicals. A second screen shows Gumball holding his urine out in the rain. A third screen appears, showing Gumball holding his urine while Tobias and Juke play in the pool. A fourth screen shows Hot Dog Guy watching a video of a marshmallow firefighter putting out a fire. The scene cuts to the boy's bathroom as Gumball quickly rushes into it]
Gumball: Ah, hold on. [Checks the bottom of the cubicles. The door is heard opening, and Hot Dog Guy is seen to have entered the bathroom.]
Gumball: Hey, um. [Stutters] I was just checking that you weren't umm-[Awkwardly laughs] Nevermind, umm. You go, you go. I'll just hang out and watch. [Hot Dog Guy runs out of the bathroom. Gumball follows after him]
Gumball: No, no! I meant wait! I'll hang out and wait. [Stops running] Hold on, what am I doing? This is my chance!
[Gumball quickly runs into the bathroom in exhilaration. After he enters the bathroom, he sees red feet inside the cubicle. He sighs and exits the bathroom. While walking through the hall, he accidentally bumps into Hot Dog Guy.]
Gumball: What the? HOW!?
[Darwin exits the bathroom, wearing red, clown-like shoes.]
Darwin: You like my new shoes? I thought I'd mix it up a little. [Walks away, with each step accompanied by a squeak. Gumball starts weeping.]
Gumball: It can't go on like this.
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​​: I know, it's been so long since I had a bathroom break, I can't laugh without gargling.
Gumball: Okay, first of all, eww. And secondly, I'm talking about the insane levels of cringe between us. It has to stop.
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​​: But how? [Gargling]
Gumball: You have to air out to awkwardness, let it all hang out. Free and loose flopping in the wind like a panting dog's tongue.
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​​: That's awkward enough already.
Gumball: And then we'll roll in our awkwardness, slather ourselves in it like a couple oiled up prized hogs until the bitter shame finally tastes sweet.
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​​: I feel like I need a shower.
Gumball: Ah, funny you should say that.
Shower Cringe
[Gumball and Hot Dog Guy are seen at the showering stalls]
Gumball: One, two, three... [He and Hot Dog Guy pull off their towels at the same time] Bam! Gym shower. How's that for awkward, what? [Looks down] Just realized you are very much wearing shorts.
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: So, what's the problem? If anything it makes more awkward.
Gumball: Aw yeah, for me. It's like showing up for costume party when everyone else is dressed for a black-tie event.
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: [Talking sideways] More like turned up to a black-tie event only wearing a black tie.
Gumball: [Sighs] This won't work if we can't reach full cringe. It's like a hot air balloon, trying to take off. It's never gonna happen if one of the guys is still wearing his pants.
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: Wait. What?
Gumball: Come on, man! Take them off!
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: No way.
Gumball: Just take them off!
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: Leave it.
Gumball: [Yelling] JUST TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES!
[Gumball looks behind him, only to see that Banana Joe is in the showering stall as well. Banana Joe unzips his skin and takes it off.]
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: You know what? I can't see how this situation could get any more cringe-worthy.
Banana Joe: Oh, I can. Moon glanding.
Gumball: What's that?
[Banana Joe holds two peaches in his hands while singing "Also Sprach Zarathustra." He then puts the peaches together, synchronizing with the music's stinger. Hot Dog Guy flees the showering stall, grabbing his bun in the process. Gumball then steps into the exit]
Gumball: Yep, good answer! But pass.
[Gumball stacks steam in front of his crotch, grabs his sweater, and chases after Hot Dog Guy]
Not Enough Cringe
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: [Running away from Gumball] Leave me alone!
[Gumball tackles Hot Dog Guy]
Gumball: Come on, man! That was nothing! We have to cringe so hard, that firemen will have to use a hydraulic jet to unclench our heinies.
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: Dude, please, let me go, you're insane!
Gumball: [Lets go of Hot Dog Guy] Wait, that's it! Insane, handsome, talented.
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: No, I didn't say handsome and talen-
Gumball: Talent Show! Let's audition for a talent show.
Elmore's Got Talent Reaction
[At the Wattersons' house, Gumball and Hot Dog Guy both watch their audition at Elmore's Got Talent]
Television Host: Welcome to Elmore's Got Talent.
Watch as the Angler Fish of Fame, lures Smallfry into its jaws using the blinding power of starlight.
Laugh at their crushed dreams.
Applaud as we create the artists of today, so you can burn them tomorrow.
And now for the worst audition of the week.
[The introductory video transitions to Gumball and Hot Dog Guy's audition. Gumball and Hot Dog Guy (on television) begin awkwardly beatboxing. While watching the show, Gumball and Hot Dog Guy react uneasily.]
Gumball: West Coast.
[The audition continues with more awkward, unskilled beatbox sounds, and gestures. Their reaction intensifies over time, until they both black out. Gumball and Hot Dog Guy later wake up in the hospital, wearing gas masks, as Bandage Doctor supervises them.]
Bandage Doctor: You, boys are very lucky to be alive. You have experienced a cringe level of a hundred thousand DJ; that's the equivalent of hearing a hundred thousand dad jokes all at once. I highly recommend stopping whatever it is you're doing before you end up with the clenching muscles of a forty year old clam.
Gumball: Thank you doctor, but we've done enough. [Bandage Doctor exits] I think we've cured it, man!
[In slow-motion, Gumball and Hot Dog Guy try to give friendly gestures to each other. Gumball tries to do a fist bump while Hot Dog Guy tries to give Gumball a high-five, resulting in the wrong outcome for both of them. Gumball and Hot Dog Guy cringe and sigh.]
Hot Dog Guy​​: I guess we're gonna have to take things to the next level.
Gumball Gives Fatherly Advice
[At Hot Dog Guy's house, Hot Dog Guy is looking at his phone while his mother is reading a book. Gumball, dressed as an aged father, enters the house and kisses Hot Dog Guy's mother on the cheek.]
Gumball: Good evening, honey.
[Hot Dog Guy screams as he sees Gumball. Gumball then sits next to Hot Dog Guy]
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: When I said take things to the next level, I didn't mean with my mom!
Gumball: [Sighs] Look kiddo. I know it's hard for you. It's a big adjustment.
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: Please, please don't.
Gumball: I'm not here to replace your father. But, know that if you want to... [Takes a deep breath] You can call me dad?
[While Gumball is talking, Hot Dog Guy begins cringing]
Gumball: You are a teenager, and you need a male role model i-in your life. You are- [Stammers] you are becoming a man, and I know you have questions, so, let me give you the talk. [Hot Dog Guy hardly presses his teeth together, causing them to break] Now when a man truly loves a wo-
[Gumball and Hot Dog Guy both cringe so hard that their faces crumple like paper]
Gumball: Wooow! That's a good one, I can already feel it echoing through time! [voice echoes]
[Flash forward to Gumball and Penny's wedding in the future.]
Gumball: [Echoing from the past] Hey Gumball, this is your brain. Enjoying the most beautiful day of your life? Well, do you remember when...
[The future Gumball stops smiling and his face crumples. Scene switches to Penny holding her and Gumball's newborn baby]
Future Penny: Say hello to daddy. [gives baby to Future Gumball]
Gumball: Hey, Gumball. Feeling happy? Well, do you remember when...
[The future Gumball stops smiling and his face crumples again. Scene then switches to Gumball's tombstone.]
Gumball: Hey, Gumball. Enjoying your eternal rest? Well, do you remember when...
[The tombstone crumples. Back in the present, Gumball notices a picture frame and picks it up.]
Gumball: Wait a minute, what's this?
[Picture shows Hot Dog Guy and several other classmates in preschool. Hot Dog Guy has a bowler haircut.]
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: Yeah yeah, I know. Not my best look, no need to rub it in.
Gumball: Yeah, I'm not talking about the fact you look a mushroom cloud from a growth-repellent atom bomb.
[Hot Dog Guy sighs]
Gumball: Look here in the corner.
[Camera pans to show toddler Gumball is in the photo as well, with a weird gigantic hairstyle]
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: Hah, [Points to Gumball in the picture] you look like the reason top hats were invented.
Gumball: No, dude. I meant we must have known each other when were little kids! We've got history, do you understand?
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: Right. I guess we have shared emotions that run deeper than we thought.
Gumball: I am afraid there is no avoiding the inevitable.
[Hot Dog Guy tries to kiss Gumball. Gumball slaps him]
Gumball: I meant we have to go back in time to find out why we feel so awkward around each other.
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: Oh, you're right.
Gumball and Hot Dog Guy Go Back in Time
[At Elmore Junior High, Gumball makes a "time machine" made out of a large, packaging box. It has a clock, macaroni, and tape to stick things together.]
Gumball: There!
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: This looks like "Exhibit A" in a court case against your committee. [Moves box using his foot] I mean, why would a memory machine need macaroni.
Gumball: They're cannelloni. They- cannellanise the- time- flux- look, in science, imagination is more important than intelligence.
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: Wow. You know that's Albert Einstein, right?
Gumball: Really? 'Cause like I've got loads of that. Like umm... the bigger the bird, the sweeter the curd.
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: I think we've just found "Exhibit B".
Gumball: Just get in the box.
[Gumball and Hot Dog Guy put their heads inside the box.]
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: So, what now?
Gumball: We go through the memories of all our awkward encounters to find out where this all started.
[Gumball moves the clock hand counter-clockwise.]
Gumball: Du-du-du-du-du-du. Du-du-du-du-du-
[The scene switches to flashbacks of Gumball and Hot Dog Guy's awkward moments in cut-out form. The memories cycle through Gumball and Hot Dog Guy inside the shower room from earlier, Gumball and Hot Dog Guy cramped inside the public bus from "The Awkwardness," Gumball hugging Hot Dog Guy inside the tent from "The Hug," and Gumball hugging Hot Dog Guy in the cafeteria, also from "The Hug." After that, a mysterious cloud appears.]
Gumball: This is it! The beginning of our repressed memories. Come on!
[Red and blue hands, resembling Gumball and Hot Dog Guy's, remove the clouds to reveal the memories. On the school bus, Hot Dog Guy is eating a bag of chips. The bus stops, resulting in the chips getting scattered all over Hot Dog Guy's seat. Gumball boards the bus and sees Hot Dog Guy cleaning his lap.]
Rocky: No standing on the bus.
[Gumball sees Hot Dog Guy cleaning his lap, misinterpreting the arm movements as Hot Dog Guy offering him a seat]
Gumball [Flashback]: Uh, okay.
[Gumball sits on Hot Dog Guy's lap. Gumball smiles to him while Hot Dog Guy looks confused and awkward.]
Gumball [Present]: You were just brushing off your lap, weren't you?
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​ [Present]: Yeah, that was pretty awkward.
[Scene changes to another flashback clip. Somewhere outside, there is a cake stand that is in-between Gumball and Hot Dog Guy. A photographer wants to capture the cake.]
Photographer: Hey, I need a photo for the school blog, that okay? [Holds up camera to take a photo of the cake. Gumball and Hot Dog Guy move in front of the cake and awkwardly hugs]
Gumball [Flashback] Could ya get on with it please?
Photographer: It's just I.. wanted a photo of the cake?
Gumball and Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​ [Flashback]: Oh. [Awkwardly laugh]
[The photographer takes a picture. Scene transitions to a classroom. Gumball is playing with blocks and Hot Dog Guy is walking. When Hot Dog Guy walks behind Gumball, a fart noise is heard. Hot Dog Guy nervously slides away]
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: It was the shoes, I swear. [Stutters] They were all new and squeaky.
[Gumball is then seen farting]
Gumball: No, it wasn't.
[Scene transitions to a crib with baby Gumball and Hot Dog Guy. Hot Dog Guy has Chicken Pox. Nicole and Hot Dog Guy's mother are both seen talking about it]
Nicole: It's better to catch it early. Chicken Pox can be a dangerous disease when you're an adult.
Hot Dog Guy's Mother: Yeah, it's like sharing a bath with your siblings. Harmless when you're a boy but a bit more challenging when you're a grown man.
[Hot Dog Guy infects Gumball with Chicken Pox.]
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​ [Present]: Huh! What the?
Gumball [Present]: Dude, remembering this only makes things a million times worse! I thought we needed to fight fire with fire, but it only makes more fire! Which does make sense if you think about it.
[Gumball and Hot Dog Guy are briefly shown in present time]
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: Please don't tell me you're gonna set fire to anything.
[Flashback scene continues.]
Gumball: No, I was thinking more about fighting trauma with trauma.
[The hands from earlier destroy Gumball and Hot Dog Guy's flashback scenes. In present time, Gumball and Hot Dog Guy are merely punching inside the box. After that, they lift up the box]
Gumball: Oh. I remember nothing. I feel great!
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: Me too!
[Gumball hugs Hot Dog Guy.]
Gumball: And, [Holds his hands] this doesn't  feel awkward.
[The hands from the flashback appear behind Gumball and Hot Dog Guy, who both notice them]
Gumball and Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​​​: No, no-no-no-no wait!
[The hands punch Gumball and Hot Dog Guy. Hot Dog Guy lands at Gumball's butt. They wake up and look shocked because of the awkward landing. Episode ends.]
