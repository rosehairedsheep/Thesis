The First Step to Recovery
[Idaho is sitting in the cafeteria when Darwin sits next to him, cuts open a potato and starts eating it]
Darwin: Mmmm! Fluffy!
Gumball: Hey Idaho, my number one brotato! How's it hangin'?
Idaho: Hmph! [Picks up his food tray and walks away]
Darwin: What's wrong with him?
Gumball: Isn't it obvious?
Darwin: Umm...nope.
Gumball: Dude. You're eating potato! In front of Idaho! The potato!
Darwin: [Gasps so hard that he sucks up the food in the cafeteria including a potato, and then spits it out] That's it! If it upsets Idaho, I'm never gonna eat potato again. There are plenty of other foods I like. I'll just eat those. I'll go ask for some fries.
Gumball: Uh, those are potato, too. What did you think French fries were made of?
Darwin: French people?
Gumball: SMH dude... SMH...
Darwin: Mmmm.
[Just as Darwin opens a bag of chips, Gumball rips the bottom of the bag]
Darwin: Huh?
Gumball: Also potatoes.
Darwin: Wedges?
Gumball: 'Tato.
Darwin: Hash browns?
Gumball: 'Tato.
Darwin: Tater tots?
Gumball: 'Tato.
Darwin: Croquette?
Gumball: 'Tato.
Darwin: Patatas bravas?
Gumball: 'Tato.
Darwin: Potato salad?
[Gumball raises his eyebrow]
Darwin: [Sighs] I can't believe I've been so insensitive. At least it was only once.
[A flashback shows Darwin reading the back of a bag of chips while sitting next to Idaho in the bus]
Darwin: "Each chip is sliced and diced, and lowered gently into the boiling oil..."
[Another flashback shows students singing as Darwin brings Idaho a potato with a sparkler in it]
Teri, Sarah, Carrie and Tobias​​​​​​: Happy birthday, dear Idaho...
[The potato bursts into flames, and Darwin is seen in the bus again]
Darwin: "...then boiled AGAIN in the boiling oil..."
[In another flashback, in class...]
Idaho: Do you have the time?
Darwin: Sure thing! [Stabs potato clock] A quarter after two.
[Once again, Darwin is shown in the bus]
Darwin: "...before boiling them in boiling oil one final time." [Hands the bag to Idaho] Want one?
[Back to the present, Darwin is face down in his plate]
Darwin: I'm so insensitive!
Gumball: Yeah. Maybe you need to think about how other people feel.
Darwin: Also, I eat way too many potatoes.
Gumball: I'm proud of you, buddy. Openly admiting you have a problem is the first step to recovery.
Darwin: Okay! [Inhales deeply] [Stands on the table] I HAVE A PROBLEM! [Sits down] Great! All better. [Leans back]
Gumball: Dude, that's not the only step to recovery. And that chair doesn't have a back on it.
[Darwin screams as he falls over]
Gumball: And maybe the problem's a lot bigger than you think.
Darwin: [Peels a potato] [Screams] I do need help.
Quitting Potatoes
[The school bell rings. Gumball and Darwin are in an empty classroom]
Gumball: Okay, dude, we've cleared out your locker and your desk. Is there anywhere else we've missed?
Darwin: Hmm. Is there anywhere else? [Reaches below his desk] I don't recall. Could there be any other potatoes? I think we've got them–
[Gumball grabs the potato taped under Darwin's desk]
Gumball: Thanks for leading me to your secret supply.
Darwin: But you'll never find my secret secr–
[Gumball grabs another potato behind Darwin]
Darwin: Dang.
Gumball: Stay strong, bro. I know this isn't easy.
Darwin: [Tearing up] This is a very emotional time for me. [Cheerful] I keep getting these horrible, devastating mood swings! [Crying] But it's fine. Everything is great. [Sobs] All I need to do is... [Screaming] RELAX! Like, really, really relax! I'll fight anything that moves! [Laughs maniacally and runs out of the classroom]
Gumball: Well, he's coping better than I thought.
Ways to Cope
[Gumball and Darwin are in the library in front of the computers]
Gumball: You know, a lot of people find doing something with their hands helps take their mind off cravings. Let's search for... [Typing] "Things to do with your hands."
Gumball and Darwin: Whoa!
Gumball: Origami! That's a great idea!
[A bit later, they find themselves surrounded in paper swans]
Gumball: Feel any better?
Darwin: Not at all.
Gumball: Well, at least it hasn't upset anyone.
Teri: Hey, guys, have you seen my parents? They were coming in today to see Miss Simian.
[Gumball and Darwin look behind them and see two larger paper swans]
Gumball and Darwin: No?
Teri: Never mind.
Gumball: Clearly, dedication and good intentions aren't working. Time to put our faith in something that looks like science, but isn't.
[Gumball puts a self-hypnosis CD in Darwin's CD player]
Dr. Zanthor: Welcome to Dr. Zanthor's "Hypnotize Yourself to a Healthier You." Listen to the sound of my voice. You're feeling very sleepy. You're lying in a field. [Yawns] You're feel– [Drowsy gibberish] [Snoring]
[Darwin takes off his headphones]
Darwin: Hmph.
Gumball: [Eating chips] Did it help?
Darwin: No! And neither is that! Get those chips out of my face!
[Darwin throws the chips at a fan, causing them to fly all over his face]
Sarah: Hey, what are you guys doing?
Gumball: [Sighs] Do we really have to tell you, or will you just admit that you've been eavesdropping and already have a solution?
Sarah: I sure do! Just leave it to Scoop Dogg!
Gumball: Oh. Okay. Is he coming here, or do we go to him?
Sarah: Neither.
Darwin: So, we just...wait here, or...
Sarah: No, no. It's me. I'm Scoop Dogg. It's a new nickname I'm trying.
Gumball and Darwin: Oh.
Gumball: That was not at all clear.
[A video plays on the computer. It is accompanied by eerie music and shows footage of potatoes being harvested, turned into fries, and being eaten by a child who laughs evilly]
Sarah: Did it work?
Darwin: Not really. Aversion therapy is just advertising with different music. See?
[Darwin clicks another video, which shows the exact same footage as the previous one but with upbeat music]
Darwin: Also, it would have worked better if you hadn't wedged my eyes open with French fries.
[Darwin throws the fries in his eyes at another fan, and his face is covered in potatoes again]
Darwin: [Sighs] Any other bright ideas?
Sarah: How about Mr. Small's group therapy? It's really good. I've been to every single one to cure my obsessive personality. Every...single...one. Haven't missed a week. Tried to – couldn't.
Group Therapy
[Gumball, Darwin and Sarah sit in Mr. Small's office]
Mister Small​​​​​​: Is everyone here? Good. Welcome to the therapy group.
Gumball: Wait, it's just you guys? You can't be a group of two. That's a duo.
Mister Small​​​​​​: Well, I just thought "duo therapy" sounded weird.
Gumball: It is weird.
Sarah: Oh, oh, oh! I'll start. My name is Sarah, and I'm obsessive about comics, movies, Gumball, fan art, Darwin, Gumball and Darwin, making lists about things I'm obsessed with–
Gumball: Sarah! This isn't about you! It's about me – helping Darwin to give up potatoes.
Mister Small​​​​​​: Nature's taste grenade? Why?!
Darwin: Because it's upsetting Idaho.
Mister Small​​​​​​: Very well. I gave up eating meat using the visualization technique. Each time I wanted to eat some meat, I would picture it with a face. It was harrowing, but it worked. Try it. [Hands Darwin a potato]
[Darwin pictures the potato with Idaho's face]
Potato: Howdy!
Darwin: Whoa! [Gasps] I think it worked! I don't feel like eating potatoes anymore. Thank you, Mr. Small.
[As Darwin and Mr. Small stand up to hug, Darwin notices a string of sausages on Mr. Small's desk]
Darwin: What's that on your desk?
Mister Small​​​​​​: Nothing. Go back to the part where you were saying what a great duo therapist I am.
Darwin: I never said that. Is that a string of sausages? And you've got steaks hidden under here!
[Gumball and Sarah gasp]
Mister Small​​​​​​: Darwin, wait! It's not what it looks like. I've been hiding meat around my desk because I can't stop eating it!
Gumball: That's exactly what it looks like.
Darwin: You're a total fake! That's it! [Takes a potato off the floor]
Gumball and Sarah: No!
Darwin: [Crying] I'm sorry, but this is who I am! [Bites in potato] Huh. I don't feel any different. Do I look okay?
[Darwin looks at Gumball, Mr. Small and Sarah, who all have potatoes for heads]
Gumball: Potato.
Mister Small​​​​​​: Potato.
Sarah: Potato, potato.
Gumball, Mister Small​​​​​​ and Sarah: POTATO! POTATO!
Potato: Hello, Darwin! Nice to see you! Glad to have you back with us!
We have things we need to tell you if it isn't too much fuss!
We really can't forgive you when you cut us into pieces!
We wish you hadn't eaten all our nephews and nieces!
Mashed, and baked, and fried, and roasted!
Sautéed, boiled, and grilled, and toasted!
Peeled off all our skin! Dug out all our eyes!
Diced us into wedges and you sliced us into fries!
We are glad we came to see you! One more thing we must discuss!
The final thing we need to say is...
All Potatoes: PLEASE, WILL YOU STOP EATING US?!?
[Darwin lies on the floor, frothing at the mouth]
Gumball: Uh...you okay, buddy?
Darwin: [Gets up] That's it! I need to do this on my own. I'm gonna lock myself in my room until I beat this thing! [Runs away]
Gumball: Uh, Mr. Small, Darwin just skipped out on the rest of the school d–
Mister Small​​​​​​: [Devouring meat] Don't look at me!
Good News
[Gumball and Sarah join Idaho at his locker]
Gumball: Brotato! We did it! We did it! [Closes locker] Darwin's given up eating potatoes!
[Idaho tears up]
Gumball: I knew you'd be pleased, but I didn't realize you'd get so emotional.
Idaho: I'm not. You just shut my hand in the locker.
Gumball: Oh. [Opens locker] Sorry.
Idaho: So, what was that about Darwin?
Gumball: He's gone home and locked himself in his room to quit eating potatoes because it was upsetting you.
Idaho: Why would I be upset? I'm not the same potatoes as you eat in the canteen. Are you saying that all potatoes look the same?
Gumball: [Gasps] Uh... Eh... Uh, uh...
Sarah: [Whispering] Say "no!"
Gumball: No?
Idaho: [Sighs] I'm gonna go see Darwin.
Gumball: So, it looks like everything worked out well in the end.
Sarah: I don't think you understand what just happened. Darwin is struggling to battle his potato cravings, and you just let Idaho – the potato – go off and see him!
Gumball: So, we're good?
[Sarah shoves her hand into her face]
Potato-Starved
[Idaho is walking in the streets]
Idaho: Phewie! Sure is hot. I better put some sunscreen on.
[He smears oil over his body]
Idaho: [Sniffs] Well, plow my furrow! This ain't sunscreen! It's tanning oil! Look at me, getting all crispy!
[At school, Sarah plays a slideshow in front of Gumball]
Sarah: [Groans] Okay, one more time! So, Idaho has gone to see Darwin. Remember, Darwin is struggling to resist eating potatoes...
Gumball: [Thinking] If I have a serious expression and nod really slowly, it'll look like I'm listening to every word she's saying.
Sarah: Gumball!
Gumball: What?
Sarah: You do realize you said all of that out loud?
Gumball: [Thinking] Quick! Think of a good excuse.
Sarah: And that!
[Idaho is still walking, when a worker in a gritter scatters salt over him]
Idaho: Hey! What do you think you're doing?!
Goblin: I'm salting the roads for ice.
Idaho: But it's, like, ninety degrees out here, and it's June!
Goblin: I'm so fired.
[Back at school, Sarah shows a cardboard model of Gumball's neighborhood]
Sarah: Okay, so, here's a model of the block you live on. I'm sorry I didn't have time to build it to scale. So, here's Darw–
Gumball: Sarah! We don't have time for this! I just realized that Idaho is on his way to see the potato-starved Darwin and Idaho is a potato! [Runs off]
Sarah: Rrrrr!! [Melts]
[A truck with the word "Coleslaw" printed on its side drives at full speed in Elmore. Its driver, Hank, tries braking]
Hank: Oh, no! The truck is out of control!
[Idaho crosses the street as the truck goes faster and faster. Hank panics, but thankfully, he was driving on a road parallel to Idaho's]
Hank: Oh. I guess it's all right.
[Idaho finally made it to the Wattersons'. He knocks on the door]
Idaho: Darwin? Darwin?
[The door creaks as it opens]
Idaho: Darwin?
[Idaho enters the silent house and starts making his way upstairs. The door slams shut on its own, startling him]
Idaho: Eh. Darwin?
[The door to Gumball and Darwin's room is ajar, and only Darwin's heavy breathing can be heard]
Idaho: Darwin? [Opens door] Darwin?
[Darwin turns around with a ravenous expression on his face. Meanwhile, Gumball arrives with Sarah, but struggles to open the door]
Gumball: Darwin! Darwin! Don't do it! Open up! Open up!
[Sarah clears her throat, then pushes the door open]
Gumball: Oh. Thanks.
[When Gumball and Sarah enter the room, Darwin is at the desk, eating loudly. Bits of potato are scattered all over the floor]
Gumball: Darwin?
[Gumball runs into the room and hurls himself to his knees]
Gumball: Nooooooooooo!
Idaho: Gumball?
Gumball: Not now, Idaho! Nooooo! Wait. What?
Darwin: Idaho brought me this baked to show me it's okay to eat potatoes, and there's no hard feelings.
Gumball: Brotato! You're alive!
Idaho: Hmph!
Gumball: Wait. I thought you were upset at Darwin.
Idaho: No, I was upset at you! I hate that stupid nickname!
Sarah: Oh, we thought you were annoyed about the potato thing, but you were annoyed about the brotato thing!
[They all laugh]
Gumball: [Thinking] Just laugh with them, and they'll think you understand.
Darwin: So, we're all gonna pretend we didn't hear him say that, right?
Sarah: Yeah.
[Idaho nods in agreement. Episode ends]
