Breakfast
[At the dining table…]
Gumball and Darwin: BREAKFAST! [Drum table three times] BREAKFAST! [Drum table three times] BREAK-
[Nicole gives them Natura Cereals]
Gumball: What the what is this? It looks medieval prison food!
Nicole: It's cereal. Real cereal.
Darwin: What's wrong with Smash-mallows?
Nicole: I've read the back of the box. This is so unhealthy that by the time you guys turn thirteen, your double chins will be touching your cankles.
Gumball: At least the mascot doesn't look like a cowboy goat with high blood pressure.
Darwin: Please, Mrs. Mom. This cereal's so bleak that if it was a movie, it would be Danish.
Nicole: I'm sorry, but the Smash-mallows are going in the trash, and that's that.
Gumball: [Sniffs]
Nicole: What?
Gumball: Thank you, Mom. Thank you for having the courage to sometimes say "no." One day, I'll look back at moments like this, and say: I had a good mother! [Sniffs]
Nicole: [Affectionately] Boys.
[Nicole, and her children hug]
Nicole: I love you. [Cries, then leaves]
Gumball: [Stops acting] Okay. What'd you get?
Darwin: [Shows two pieces of Smash-mallows] Not much. You?
Gumball: [Sighs, and shows a handful] Ohhh! [Spills more cereal from his sleeve on the floor]
Darwin: [Laughs]
Gumball: Okay. I don't think we're ever going to see Smash-mallows again. So we gotta make the most of these.
Darwin: How?
[Skips to them in the kitchen with their cereals in bowls]
Gumball: We exercise as we eat.
[They do as said]
Gumball: [While eating] That way, the blood rushes to your head, and you get more of a sugar rush!
Darwin: Are you feeling anything?
Gumball: [Burpy voice] Mostly acid reflux.
[Cut to them on sofa]
Gumball: If we eat then stand on our heads, the sugar will rush to our brains faster due to gravity.
[They eat rapidly, then stand upside-down]
Darwin: [Milk spills out his mouth] It's not working.
Gumball: Okay.
[Scene shifts to them back a the table]
Gumball: We ingest it through the eye. It's way closer to the brain, and the sugar rush will kick in faster.
Darwin: What? Like rub it in?
Gumball: Nah silly. Like this.
[He eats his cereal with his eyelids. Darwin copies him]
Gumball: Getting anything?
Darwin: No.
Gumball: Yeah, me neither.
[Suddenly, they are sucked into space, and zoom through the stars]
Darwin: [High-pitched voice] Dude, this cereal is amazing!
[A colored outline of the cereal's box appears, then fades]
Darwin: Who invented it?
Gumball: [High-pitched voice] People!
[The outline of a head with the brain appears, then zooms out]
Gumball: People invent everything. Like at some point, a guy was sitting down, and he invented the mustache.
[A gold mustache flies through them]
Darwin: And then one day, some guy saw rotting milk on the floor, and he was like "hey, that smells like feet!"
[A colored foot appears, and again zooms away]
Darwin: "I should put it in my mouth!" Boom! Invented cheese!
Gumball: What are we gonna invent?
Darwin: I don't know. Does it matter if we achieve anything?
Gumball: I guess not! Look at pigeons.
[A colored wireframe model of a pigeon appears, then zooms away]
Gumball: They don't get anything done.
Darwin: Yeah! What's the point of their lives?
[Suddenly they stop flying through space, and gasp]
Gumball and Darwin: [Normal voice] What's the point of our lives?
[They snap back to reality. Gumball almost drowns in a fountain. He gets out, dressed in a tutu.]
Gumball: [Spits water] I will find out!
[Cut to Darwin, on top of a streetlight.]
Darwin: And I'll help you!
[He slides down, revealing that he is chained to the streetlights with a pair of pink fuzzy handcuffs.]
Darwin: As soon as I find away to get rid of these handcuffs, and this thing on my BUTT! [Shows his butt, revealing a tattoo]
The Quest for Life's Meaning
[The two walk through the streets]
Gumball: Oh man. That's a big question. "What is the meaning of life?" [Echos, then imitates big explosion and smaller mini explosions]
Darwin: Who could answer such a question?
Gumball: Well, nobody here. We better ask around.
[They walk away. From a very far distance, Mr. Small is seen running towards them]
Mister Small​: Guys! Wait! I've got the answer! GUYS, I've got the answer! [Stops] Wait! [Runs back, reappears driving Janice] Wait for me! [Janice rolls over, and launches him to where the two boys passed seconds ago] I've got the answer! [Runs after them]
[In Ripley 2000...]
Gumball: Larry, what do you think the meaning of life is?
Larry: Hmmm… work! It's important to be useful. Look at me! I got it all figured out. I get up, I shower, I come to work, I work all day, I go home, I go to sleep! I get up, I shower, I come to work, I work all day, I go home, I go to sleep! I get up, I shower, I come to work- [Stops, twitches] I get up, I shower, [Takes cash register money] I come to work, I work all day, I go home, I go to sleep! [Throws away hat and name tag]
[Karen comes out of the manager's office]
Larry: I get up, I shower, I come to work, I work all day [Jumps over counter] I go home, I go to sleep! [Kisses Karen] I get up- [Continues]
Manager: Needlemeyer! What do you think you're--?!
Larry: [Grabs manager and kisses him, then throws him away]
[Still talking, Larry leaves the shop. Gumball and Darwin follow]
Larry: I shower, I come to work, I work all day, I go home, I go to sleep. I get up, I shower- [Steals the Robinson's car]
Mister Small​: Hey! I've got the--
[Larry accidentally hits Mr. Small with the Robinson's car, and drives off with Gumball and Darwin. Mrs. Robinson enters the space where the driver's seat used to be, then drops to the ground. Larry stops at a beach]
Larry: I get up, I shower, I come to work, I work all day, I go home, I go to sleep. I get up, I shower, I come to work, I work all day, I go home, I go to sleep. [Walks into the water, then swims away]
Gumball: Eh, seems to work for him. But I feel like there might be a little more to life than that.
[Cut to Alan]
Alan​​​​​​​​: Yes, there is! You see, I believe, the meaning of life is to be good to others because if you help someone, then one day, they might help someone else, and the world will be a better place.
[The scene zooms out, showing Julius and Mowdown trashing Alan's lemonade stand. Gumball and Darwin are raising their hands]
Julius: Right. We trashed your stuff, now let's knock your block off!
Alan​​​​​​​​: Please. Allow me. [Hits himself on Julius' fist] Oh! [Coughs] [To Gumball and Darwin] Please, show a little charity... Help me!
[Julius and Mowdown glare at them]
Gumball: Well, charity begins at home… which is where we're going right now.
[They slide away]
Family Knows Best?
[The scene cuts to their house, then to the boys asking Nicole while she is gardening]
Gumball: Mom, what do you think the meaning of life is?
Nicole: [Removes sunglasses] Hm, now that's a tricky one. I guess it would be- [With demonic voice, evil eyes and flaming background] Crush your enemies, see them quiver before you, and hear the lamentation of their women! [Normal voice] Or having a family! It's pretty much the same.
[Gumball inhales sharply, and they walk away, frightened. The next scene shows them with Richard in the kitchen (who takes out a block of butter from the refrigerator)]
Richard: The meaning of life? Well, I've dedicated my life to the indulgence of the senses. A feeling of total satisfaction and pleasure is the highest form of existence.
[Richard scoops the block of butter, makes a sandwich out of it, and eats it whole]
Gumball: That just sounds like stuffing your face.
Richard: [With mouth full] Yeah, but philosophically.
Darwin: You do look philosophical in your toga.
Richard: This is not a toga! It's a full body bib. [Walks away, revealing his almost bare back]
Gumball: [Inhales] Not quite a full body, unfortunately.
[The boys sneak up on Anais. Anais puts down the book she's reading with annoyance]
Anais: Ugh... What?
Gumball: What's the meaning of life?
Anais: To understand the meaning of life, you need to better yourself by learning as much as you can.
Darwin: So you can answer any other question?
Anais: Absolutely.
Gumball: Like "would you rather kiss a dog, or have a baby drool in your mouth?"
Darwin: Or "would you rather have foot-hands, or hand-feet?"
Gumball: Or "how long would a person survive just by eating their own hair?"
Anais: [Sighs and leaves]
Darwin: What you doing?
Anais: In just three sentences, you proved that I don't want to know everything. If my quest for knowledge is pointless, [Hops on couch, beside Richard] then I might as well go for the second best option.
Gumball: And what's that?
Anais: Blissful ignorance. [Starts eating]
Ask Mother Nature
[In the forest of doom…]
Darwin: Gumball, what are we doing here?
Gumball: Who's better qualified to know the meaning of life than mother nature herself. Let's ask this little squirrel.
[Gumball makes "squirrel" noises to a squirrel nearby. The squirrel slaps him]
Gumball: Ow! What did I say?
Darwin: You just said he was nuttier than his own droppings. Let me try. [Makes "squirrel noises"]
[The squirrel nods, and begins a song]
Squirrel: The meaning of life has a single rule, I know it makes sense though it may seem cruel. The logic of the rule cannot be beaten, but the meaning of life is to eat or be -
Snake: [Eats squirrel] The truth our friend was trying to sweeten, that the meaning of life is to eat or be -
Bird: [Eats snake] Alas, poor snake! His life was fleeting. For the meaning of life is to eat or be—
Small creature: [Eats bird] Allow me to finish what the bird was tweeting [Flies] the meaning of life is to eat or be—
Large creature: [Eats creature] I'm sorry our song just keeps repeating, but the meaning of life is to eaaat, or be- [Stops, waiting to be eaten. But nothing happens] Well I guess that the biggest remains unhurt, which means I have some time-
[Gumball and Darwin are terrified]
Large creature: For dessert!
[The boys leave in a flash]
Mister Small​​​​​​​: Wait, kids! [Wheezing] I got the answer!
[The large creature growls at him. From the distance, Mr. Small screams. Gumball and Darwin run to the cemetery]
Gumball: [Pants] I think we're safe now.
[A zombie's hand emerges from a nearby grave. Gumball screams]
Darwin: [Holds hand] Oh hi. So, since you've been there and done it, maybe you could help us out with the question: what's the meaning of life?
Zombie: You have to live life to the fullest, dude. Look at me, I've done it all. I've jumped out of a plane, I've jumped out of a plane, I've jumped out of a-
Gumball: Is that all you did?
Zombie: Well, yeah. I was eighteen, so… yeah.
Darwin: And how was it? You know, your life?
Zombie: Aw man. It was really good for seventy seconds, and then really, really, really, really, really bad for a couple of seconds.
Gumball: How is that living life to the fullest?
Zombie: Think about it: would you rather live life to the fullest for seventy seconds? Or live a boring life for seventy years?
Gumball and Darwin: Seventy years.
Gumball: Straight up.
[They leave]
Zombie: No no no no no no! Don't go, it's boring here! Come back! [Parachute deploys] Darn. Aw, now you work.
[The scene skips to Gumball skipping stones]
Darwin: What are you doing?
Gumball: Skipping stones. It's what people do when they're down.
Darwin: Uh yeah, not but usually indoors.
[Gumball skips another stone. The stone hits Rocky on the other side of the pool, and he falls into the water. Coach walks up to them]
Coach  Russo: What are you two doing?
Gumball: [Sigh] We're bummed out because we can't find the true meaning of life.
Coach  Russo: The meaning of life is to find yourself.
Darwin: Have you found yourself?
Coach  Russo: Not yet. But I'm in here. [Pushes finger inside herself deeply] Somewhere.
Gumball: Then how are we supposed to find ourselves?
Coach  Russo: To find yourself, you will need to walk through the hottest dessert, cross the most dangerous seas, climb the highest mountain. Then once at the top, you will know.
[As she speaks, Gumball and Darwin are visualized. The surf a wave, and climb a high mountain]
Gumball: [Imaginary] That's it! I know what I am!
Gumball: I'm lazy! I don't have to climb a mountain to figure that out. [Walks away with Darwin]
[The scene shows Mr. Small on top of the same imaginary mountain]
Mister Small​​​​​​​: What? Wait, you mean none of this was real?
Your Life Just Doesn't Count
[Back in the roads, Gumball sighs and falls down. But his head makes him roll over his back]
Gumball: Why isn't anyone able to answer our question!? Tell me universe, WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE?
[Camera zooms from the Earth, and out into the Solar System]
Uranus: Hey guys, quick! I think someone's in need of a cosmic answer.
Neptune: Let's explain the meaning of his pitiful existence to him in the form of a feel good song!
Venus: A-one.
Jupiter: Two.
Mercury: Three!
Venus: When you think you've got a problem
And your life is full of doubt,
Mercury and Venus: Remember in the scheme of things
Your life just doesn't count!
Jupiter: To you, a leaf might seem quite small,
Jupiter and Saturn: But to an ant, it's ten feet tall.
Jupiter, Saturn, with Uranus, Venus and Mars: It's hard to be objective,
So we'll offer some perspective.
(Voice): You think there's nothing greater than the planet you call Earth,
But Earth can seem quite skinny next to Neptune's mighty girth!
Neptune: [spoken] Oi...
Earth: [spoken] Relax!
Planets: 'Cause when you think you've got a problem
If you're thinner or you're fatter
Remember in the scheme of things
Your life just doesn't matter
Now the Sun can make us all feel small
'Cause he's the biggest of us all
But that's just in the Solar System
Bigger things than that exist
The Milky Way
The galaxy
And don't forget the universe
Mars and Venus: That's just the ones we know about
They're huge compared to you or us
Uranus: [Solo] You're tiny and you're miniscule
Irrelevant, a speck
Upon the dark side of that rock
You're just a measly little fleck
Your life may last a century
On Earth, or maybe quicker
But up here, a hundred years is just a flash, a blip, a flicker!
Planets: So when you
Think you've got a problem
When your life is full of doubt,
Remember in the scheme of things
Your puny, little, tiny, weeny, meager, futile, worthless, teeny, boring, foolish, pointless, minimal, wretched, gloomy, bleak, and pitiful
Life just does not count!
[Back on Earth, Gumball and Darwin watch the sun. The sun speaks in super slow motion]
The Sun: [Slowed down] When you think you've got a problem and your life is full of doubt.
Darwin: Huh? What's that all about?
Gumball: Don't know, but the joke's on them. By the time they finish their smug little song, the sun will have collapsed under its own mass and exploded, so- [Blows raspberry]
[4.75 billion years later]
Planets: …life just does not count!
The Sun: Hey, you know that kid four point seven five billion years ago?
Planets: Yeah?
The Sun: He was right.
[The sun explodes. The scene goes back to the present]
An Unlikely Source of Wisdom
Sussie: Pigeon mayo! [Throws mayonnaise to pigeons] Pigeon mayo! [Throws mayonnaise to pigeons] [Laughs]
[Gumball and Darwin sit beside her]
Gumball: [Grunts] What a waste of a day.
Darwin: Oh, we'll never find the meaning of life.
Sussie: Ah! Pigeon mayo! [Throws mayonnaise to pigeons and laughs]
Gumball: Well, at least someone's got it all figured out.
Sussie: Well, yes. You see, life's not about the destination, it's about the journey and making friends along the way.
[Gumball and Darwin gape at her]
Sussie: The search for meaning is, in fact, the very thing that gives our life meaning, so, really, the only question that is truly worth asking is--
Mister Small​​​​​​​: I've got the answer! I've got the answer! [Runs to them, then slips on mayonnaise]
Sussie: So, really, the only true meaning of life is finding your own way to enjoy it.
Gumball: Like laughing at that? [Pointing to Mr. Small]
Sussie: Or doing this. [Throws mayonnaise to pigeons] Pigeon mayo! Pigeon mayo!
[Gumball and Darwin laugh as the episode ends]
