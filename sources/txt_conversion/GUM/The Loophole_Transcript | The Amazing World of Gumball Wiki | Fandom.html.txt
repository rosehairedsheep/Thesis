Complaining About Homework
[The school bell rings. The students walk out of Miss Simian's class groaning]
Gumball: I just don't understand the concept, shouldn't we have covered everything during the school day? Homework is like going to the bathroom and then coming back with a doggy bag.
Lucy Simian: Fill out a form and put it in the suggestion box.
Gumball: Hmm, I get it. You think I'm too lazy to go through the administrative motions. Well, just watch me.
[Gumball writes a suggestion on a piece of paper and puts it in the box, only for it to be destroyed by a shredder below. Miss Simian smiles]
Gumball: [Sighs] Where do I file a complaint about the suggestion box?
Lucy Simian: Please post it in the complaint box. [Grins]
Gumball: And where's that?
[The scene changes to a mailbox in the middle of the desert surrounded by two skeletons]
The Best Years of Your Life
[In the hallway, Bobert scans his homework and almost instantly fills it in]
Bobert: Homework complete. [Closes his locker]
Gumball: [Sighs] He's got his homework done in two point four seconds when it's gonna take us two-point-forever! People say your school days are the best years of your life. That's like a guy stuck in a sausage grinder saying "It's okay" when it was only his fingers caught in the machine.
Darwin: What are you talking about?
Gumball: Sometimes I wish I could just go straight to the end of the process.
Darwin: What? Like going full sausage?
Gumball: No, just be an adult already.
Darwin: Yeah, but then you have to get a job, and file your taxes, and pay your taxes, and understand taxes...
Gumball: No, I mean, I just want to skip the whole hassle of life. You get it, right, Bobert?
Bobert: Computing request. [Playing Gumball's request] "I just want to skip the whole hassle of life." Command integrated. Terminating Gumball's life.
[Bobert shoots a laser at Gumball's head, causing it to disappear. Gumball's head grows back and he puts out the fire on top of it]
Gumball: Could you take things any more literally?!
Bobert: [Loads] Computing... Negative. My processor cannot take things anymore literally.
Darwin: He didn't actually mean it. Like, what would you do if someone asked you to give them a hand?
[Bobert grabs Darwin's hand and is about to cut it with a circular saw, but Gumball stops him]
Gumball: Alright! Alright! Stop! Bobert's really dangerous. He's a potential killing machine! We should set him some rules. I mean, think of the danger he represents for himself and others – for society, for animals. Think of the children, Darwin. The precious children. The children.
Darwin: This is just some thinly veiled excuse to avoid doing your homework, isn't it?
Gumball: Yup.
Darwin: [Sighs] Thank goodness. I was looking for one too. Shall we go?
Gumball: Yeah, come on. Let's bounce.
Bobert: Command integrated.
[Bobert starts bouncing as Gumball grabs his arm and pulls him away]
Making the Rules
Preventing Injury
[The scene cuts to the Wattersons' house, in Gumball and Darwin's bedroom]
Gumball: Okay, let's set Bobert some simple rules so he can't hurt anyone. Bobert, as a rule, you must never raise your hand against anyone.
Bobert: Command integrated.
Gumball: How do we know it worked?
Darwin: Bobert, try to hurt Gumball.
[Bobert kicks Gumball in the knee, sending him to the floor]
Gumball: Ow! What was that?!
Bobert: Directive followed. No hand was raised during the hurting process.
Gumball: Okay, you're not allowed to raise any part of your body to hurt anyone.
Bobert: Command integrated.
Darwin: Good. Now try to hurt Gumball.
[Gumball stands up, only for Bobert to headbutt him. Gumball gains a black eye]
Gumball: AH! Come on, man!
Bobert: Directive followed. No part of my body was raised during the hurting process.
Gumball: Okay. [Sigh and stands up] You're not allowed to raise or lower your body to hurt anyone.
Bobert: Command integrated.
Darwin: Now try to hurt Gumball.
Gumball: Dude, please just–
[Bobert charges into a bruised Gumball, somehow sending him a year back. He crashes through the door into past Gumball and Darwin]
Darwin: Ow! What the–
Gumball: Sorry, guys. Bobert knocked me into last year. Just do your thing, I'll wait this one out.
[Gumball returns to the present]
Gumball: Okay. You may not move at all to hurt anyone.
Bobert: Command integrated.
Darwin: Perfect... Now try to hurt Gumball.
Gumball: No, please! Huh, it worked.
Darwin: Aw, I knew you'd get there in the end!
[They laugh. Suddenly, Gumball starts coughing and his face becomes deformed]
Gumball: What did you do?!
Bobert: Directive followed. I am emitting concentrated radioactive waves.
Darwin: Well, stop!
Gumball: Wait, maybe it'll give me some kind of super– [Gags and coughs out his tongue; it runs in circles until he catches it and punches it back in place] Sorry, carry on.
Darwin: Alright, how's this: Bobert, you can never hurt anyone in any way, or let them be hurt.
Bobert: Command integrated.
Gumball: Now, hurt Darwin! [Hides behind Bobert]
[They wait for a moment, nothing happens]
Darwin: There, now everyone's safe.
[Darwin walks out of the room while Gumball glares at him]
Choking Hazard
[Darwin opens the pantry and takes a bag of peanuts]
Gumball: So?
Darwin: Still nothing.
Gumball: He's probably microwaving some part of you that will cause your kids to be born without skin.
Bobert: Negative. The directive prevents me from hurting anyone in any way.
Gumball: Hm, shame. Definitely was your turn to get it in the neck.
Darwin: Who could hurt such a pretty face? [Makes a baby face. Throws a peanut into his mouth and starts choking]
Gumball: A-ha! Finally! It's not nice when you're the one getting hurt, is it? Is it really bad? [Panicking] Wait, it is really bad, isn't it? Oh my gosh, he's choking!
[Gumball is about to slap Darwin's back, but Bobert grabs his hand]
Gumball: What are you doing?!
Bobert: I cannot let anyone get hurt. In clearing his airways, you may bruise his spinal area.
Gumball: You do it, then!
Bobert: Negative. I cannot hurt anyone.
Gumball: Okay, no rules. Just save him!
Bobert: Command integrated. In what manner would you like Darwin to be saved?
Gumball: It doesn't matter, just pick one!
[Bobert lifts Darwin and his hand extends to send air inside of him. The air causes Darwin to inflate, but successfully rids him of the obstructing food]
Gumball: Why on Earth would you choose such an undignified method?!
Bobert: I used a random algorithm in accordance to your command.
[Gumball touches Darwin, causing him to pop]
Enforcing the Law
[Gumball, Darwin and Bobert go to the mall]
Gumball: Okay, new rule. How about you just uphold the law? It was created by the most brilliant minds, so what could go wrong?
Bobert: Command integrated.
[Bobert shoots a laser beam at Miss Simian nearby, who loses all of her hair]
Gumball: Dude, I said uphold the law!
Bobert: According to the law in New Mexico, females are forbidden to appear unshaven in public.
Gumball: Seriously? I mean, that is pretty funny but– Seriously, what don't you understand? Why are you taking everything so lit– [Bobert walks away] Where is he going now?
[Gary slurps his soup loudly. Bobert's arm turns into a gun-like weapon and points to Gary's head]
Bobert: According to the law in New Jersey, it is illegal to slurp your soup.
[Gary starts screaming, but Bobert's arm changes into an even more complex weapon]
Bobert: In North Carolina, it is illegal to sing off-key.
[Gary's scream becomes auto-tuned]
Guard 2: Drop your weapon, or I'll have to use mine! [He mimics a gun with his finger; Bobert bends it backwards]
Bobert: Do you have a license for that goatee?
Guard 2: Huh?
Bobert: [Ripping the guard's goatee] In Massachusetts, goatees are illegal without a license. [Throws the goatee onto Billy's face]
Billy: Mother, I'm hirsute!
Bobert: [Shoots a laser at Billy's lollipop] Lollipops are also banned.
Gumball: Bobert, stop it!
Bobert: Obstruction of justice.
[Bobert prepares to shoot Gumball but Darwin pushes him out of the way. Bobert fires on the roof instead]
Bobert: Bobert destroyed public property. Engaging penalty. [Tasers himself] Bobert committed aggravated assault on Bobert. Engaging penalty.
Gumball: Stop, stop, stop! Just don't uphold the law.
Bobert: Command integrated. [Steals Betty's purse]
Betty​​​​​: Hey!
Bobert: [Runs away] You'll never catch me! [Crashes into something offscreen]
Protecting Life
Darwin: Bobert is really dangerous. I guess science-fiction was right, robots are bound to destroy us all.
Bobert: Analyzing problem. The most logical solution would be to terminate myself. Deleting System thirty-two...
Gumball: Stop it! [Slaps Bobert] You're being hysterical!
Bobert: [Slaps Gumball] You stop it. You are being illogical!
Darwin: You cannot just terminate yourself.
Bobert: It is the most rational solution.
[Gumball stands up, disfigured by Bobert's hit]
Gumball: No. [Puts his face back into place] No! All life must be protected, including yours.
Darwin: That's it! Bobert, new brand directive. Protect life at all costs.
Bobert: Command integrated.
[A car drives near Bobert. He holds it back to let some ants cross the road]
Bobert: Command followed. All life on Earth should be preserved: human, animal, insect, even virus.
Gumball: It works! We did it!
[Gumball and Darwin start laughing, but quickly turn to crying. They walk away.]
Gumball: Now there's no excuse to dodge our homework.
[Bobert begins to analyze different situations]
Bobert: Scanning for threat to life on Earth. [Sees a car] Threat found. Carbon footprint excessive. [Harold crosses the road on a hoverboard] Threat found. Alternative transport, absurd. [Juke removes a pair of scissors from many different packages] Threat found. Levels of packaging unacceptable. Really unacceptable. Totally idiotic. [Spots Melted Cheese Guy] Threat found. Calculating cubic meters of methane produced. Threat level: obscene. Compiling data... Primary threat to life on Earth detected: mankind.
Society Collapses
Gumball: [Sighs] If Bobert's not gonna help us with our homework, there's only one thing we can do.
Darwin: Do it ourselves?
Gumball: Pshh, no. Find someone online to do it for us. [Types on his phone] That's weird, there's no Internet.
Mister Small​​​​​: No, you're saying it the wrong way. It's pronounced quinoa!
Larry: It is pronounced quinoa!
Mister Small​​​​​: Quinoa!
Larry: Quinoa!
Mister Small​​​​​: Fine. I guess we'll have to settle this the new-fashioned way.
[Both pull out their phones and start typing furiously]
Mister Small​​​​​: Huh, that's weird. No network.
Larry: Me neither. Then I guess we'll have to settle this the old-fashioned way.
[They have a slap fight. Meanwhile, the Goblin and Principal Brown check their account balance at the ATMs]
Goblin: That's weird, I got no money.
Nigel Brown: Me neither! But doesn't that mean...
[The Earth stops spinning, causing Rocky, Principal Brown and the Goblin to fall down]
Goblin: But money makes the world go round!
Rocky: Wait. If there's no money, how are we supposed to buy stuff?
Nigel Brown: We don't! We just take it. The foundations of civilization have collapsed. It's every man for himself!
[They rip they shirts and Principal Brown attempts to do the same but rips the fur off his chest instead]
Nigel Brown: [In pain] I shouldn't have done that.
[They break into a store and steal the things inside. A truck crashes into a wall near Mr. Small and Larry, burying them in potatoes]
Mister Small​​​​​: Oh no, we're buried under a pile of potahtoes!
Larry: [Outraged] Why, you–! [Tackles Mister Small and attacks him]
Darwin: People are tearing each other apart! Call the paramedics, call the fire department, call the police!
[Principal Brown runs out of the store, with the skin of his chest still exposed]
Gumball: And the fashion police.
[Gumball runs into a phone booth and dials 911]
Gumball: We need help!
Bobert: Request denied.
Gumball: Bobert? You're behind all this?
Bobert: My analysis identified mankind as the main threat to life on this planet. The rational solution is to accelerate your extinction.
[A plane grazes close to the ground and destroys part of the booth]
Gumball: Bobert, I order you to stop!
Bobert: Order invalid. You are part of the threat yourself. Terminating conversation in three...two...one...
[Darwin pulls him out of the phone booth as it blows up]
Gumball: Quick! We have to stop Bobert before he...saves the world?
Face to Face with Bobert
[Bobert is in what appears to be a basement]
Bobert: Commencing final extinction in T minus ten. Nine. Eight–
Notification: You've got mail.
Bobert: Attachment detected: Gumball and Darwin. Illogical. Life forms cannot attach themselves to email.
[Gumball and Darwin kick the door open]
Gumball: We didn't, but we knew it would distract you. [They fall to their knees crying] Please don't make us extinct!
Darwin: We're not all that bad!
Bobert: According to my data, mankind exploits its resources and destroys its environment. One day, it will colonize space and destroy more environments.
Darwin: Yeah, but surely in these new environments we'll need to grow trees and raise animals, so we're preserving life.
Gumball: Yeah, so we can burn and eat them.
Bobert: The closest comparison to mankind is a virus. It must be terminated. Resuming countdown. Eight. Seven.
[Bobert is heard counting in the background while Gumball remembers what he said earlier]
Bobert: Mankind is a virus. All life on Earth should be preserved, even virus.
[The thoughts echo in Gumball's head and he turns around just as the counter reaches 1]
Gumball: That's it! Bobert, you can't destroy mankind because, uh, uh... If mankind's a virus– No, uh. [Sighs] Nevermind, I lost it. [Walks away] Carry on.
Bobert: One–
Darwin: Wait! You said all life should be protected. Even a virus. So you can't make us extinct!
Bobert: Extinction protocol conflict with life protection protocol. Illogical argument detected. Terminating extinction protocol.
Gumball: [Sighs in relief] I'm glad that's over. So, how about a little help with our homework?
[The episode ends]
