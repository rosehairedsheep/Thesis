At the School Cafeteria
[The episode starts with Gumball and Darwin eating spaghetti at the cafeteria]
Gumball: [Smiles at Darwin and starts to groan] This spaghetti tastes like-
Darwin: Like somebody already ate it!
Gumball: Hey Rocky, don't go too far away with that bucket [Picks up bucket] cause I-
Darwin: Cause I'll be needing it any second!
Gumball: Can I get this pasta to go?
Darwin: Straight in the trash, that is!
Gumball: Dude! How do you know everything I'm gonna say?
Darwin: Because that's what you say every time we have pasta.
Both: What the what?! I'm not that predictable!
Gumball: Okay, predict this!
[Gumball takes a handful of spaghetti and rubs it all over his shirt while making loud noises]
Gumball: Huh? How predictable was that?
Darwin: Predictable enough for me to bring you a spare sweater.
Gumball: [Roars] Thank you though, that's very thoughtful.
[Gumball takes off his sweater and puts the new one on]
Gumball: Right, well... predict this!
[Gumball gets on the table, starts making a couple of weird movements, and slaps his butt repeatedly]
Gumball: Is this predictable?
Darwin: Yeah, I see you've done this every times. [Points to a sign that shows the prohibition of Gumball's action]
Gumball: [Gets off of the table, sits down and sighs]
Darwin: [Rubs Gumball slowly] It's alright, I forgive you.
Gumball: For what?
Darwin: For trying to pinch me after saying-
Both: Bet ya didn't see this coming!
[Gumball tries to pinch Darwin but he blocks all of Gumball's attempts easily while eating the pasta. Gumball sighs and sobs, while Darwin wipes his mouth with a handkerchief and gives it to Gumball]
Gumball: [Takes the handkerchief, wipes his nostril, throws it away and gets on the table once again] I'll prove that I'm unpredictable!
Darwin: I know. This is the part when you get yourself into some weird situation and when I try to warn you about it, you just say [Blows a raspberry]
[Gumball sees Hot Dog Guy]
Hot Dog Guy​: Hey, Jamie! [Waves his hand]
Gumball: Aha! [Runs to Hot Dog Guy and greets him] Hey, buddy!
Hot Dog Guy​: Uh, I think you've got the wrong person.
Gumball: [Hugs Hot Dog Guy] How are you doing? Aw! [Laughs]
Hot Dog Guy​: Uh, good...? [Laughs nervously] Thanks.
[Darwin gives them a confused look; Gumball looks back and makes a smiley face while Hot Dog Guy remains perplexed]
The Next Day
[Darwin and Gumball are shown walking in the hall]
Gumball: [Whistles happily; stops as he sees Hot Dog Guy] Oh.
Gumball: Hey! [Laughs nervously] Nice to see you!
Hot Dog Guy​: Yeah! [Laughs nervously] How you doing, bro?
[They awkwardly hug and pat each other]
Hot Dog Guy​: [Sweats heavily] Well... uh.
[Both of them smile awkwardly, not knowing how to respond. As they leave, Hot Dog Guy and Gumball quickly facepalm]
Darwin: Why did you hug him again?
Gumball: I have to! You can't 'de-hug' a person. Once you hit the hug level you gotta stay there.
Darwin: Predictably, you're gonna deny this is a problem and it's gonna get weird.
[Gumball blows a raspberry as Darwin did previously]
The Day After
[Gumball and Hot Dog Guy bump into each other the school hall]
Gumball: [Smiles awkwardly; Monologue] Okay, okay. You've got this. Don't be too friendly. Just quick, professional hug.
Hot Dog Guy​: [Smiles awkwardly; Monologue] Oh man, I hope he doesn't wanna hug again.
Gumball: [Raises his hand, trying to hug Hot Dog Guy]
Hot Dog Guy​: Uh... [Also raises his hand]
Gumball: Darn it!
Hot Dog Guy​: [Speaks] Hi, buddy.
[Both of them hug together]
Gumball: [Monologue] Okay, just a quick, touchable hello. Move on. [Speaks] Hey, duuuuu--- [Monologue] No! 'Dude' is too friendly! Abort! Abort! [Speaks] Du-du-du-du-du-du. [Sings it while swinging Hot Dog Guy along with him]
Hot Dog Guy​: [Monologue] What? Okay...
[Both of them rhymes the tone, pat each other and ran away]
The Day After the Day After
[Gumball and Hot Dog Guy are in the schoolyard walking until they bump into each other]
Gumball: Hey! My man! [Laughs nervously] There's my man! [Laughs] That you! [Laughs nervously as Hot Dog Guy continues to stare at him] Yeah. That's... my man.. [Monologue] [Sighs heavily]
Hot Dog Guy​: Uh... Bring bring! Oh! It's the legend phone! [Makes a phone with his hand] Hello? Yeah, he's here! [Passes the "phone" to Gumball] It's for you. [Monologue] Legend phone? What does that even mean?
Gumball: [Takes the phone and makes his hand in the shape of a phone] Hello! It's me. The legend! Hahe, click.
[They both hug awkwardly again]
Hot Dog Guy​: Du-du-du-du-
Gumball: [Copies him] Du-du-du-du-
[Gumball goes sitting down on a bench next to Darwin while curling up his legs swinging up and down. Darwin then looks at him]
Gumball: It's okay. It's okay. It's only once a day.
[Five minutes later, Gumball and Hot Dog Guy are seen in the bathroom hugging while singing again, while Tobias climbs out of the stalls and exits the room shielding his view]
Confronting the Situation
[Gumball and Darwin are now seen by Darwin's locker]
Darwin: Look, if you want it to stop, you have to confront the situation.
Gumball: I can't. I need to avoid direct confrontation. It brings me too much anxiety. I'm that kind of person.
Darwin: That kind of person's called a chicken.
Gumball: I like my version better.
[Gumball looks ahead of him, where Hot Dog Guy is there talking to some friends]
Gumball: Oh no, he's there.
Hot Dog Guy​: And he keeps turning up and I— [Looks at Gumball]
[They start backing up and start running trying to avoid each other. Gumball hides in a mop bucket but Rocky grabs him and uses him as a mop. He knocks over Sarah and tries to hide in her locker but slams his face instead. He then hides in the janitors closet only to find out Hot Dog Guy is also there. They look at each other and gasp]
Gumball: He-heyyyyyy...
Hot Dog Guy​: [Monologue] Wait a minute, I keep on pretending to be friends with this guy and he doesn't even know my name.
Gumball: ...Hot Dog Guy?
Hot Dog Guy​: [Monologue] Huh, guess he does.
[They both hug each other awkwardly again]
Gumball: So, uh, what are you doing here?
Hot Dog Guy​: Me? I was just in here, uh, counting brooms.
Gumball: Counting brooms?
Hot Dog Guy​: Yup, I just love counting brooms!
Gumball: ...In the dark?
Hot Dog Guy​: Yea, it's more challenging that way. Now the whole lights on I can quite clearly see that there's two brooms. [Points at the brooms] One and two. [Laughs nervously]
Gumball: [Laughs nervously with him too] [Monologue] Oh my gosh this guy's insane.
[The bell rings up, showing that it's lunchtime]
Hot Dog Guy​: [Monologue] Oh no, lunchtime! Don't say it, don't say it. [Speaks] Hey, what are you doing for lunch? [Monologue] GOSH DARN IT!
Gumball: [Monologue] Okay, don't say cafeteria. Bluff him, bluff him. [Speaks] Cafeteria?! [Monologue] DAGNABBIT, YOU IDIOT! That was a double bluff!
Awkwardness in the Cafeteria
Hot Dog Guy​: [Monologue] Oh man, no one's said anything for like three minutes. Have to make conversation. [Speaks] Hey um, what's your favorite subject?
Gumball: [Awkwardly] Lunch. [Laughs]
Hot Dog Guy​: [Deadpan] Lunch isn't a subject.
[Gumball winces and runs off]
Rocky: Hey! You forgot to pay!
Hot Dog Guy​: Ah, it's okay, I'll get this.
[Gumball pivots and turns to face Hot Dog Guy, accompanied by a dramatic sting]
Rocky: Okay. Gumball, is this a friend of yours?
[The camera zooms in on Gumball, his face terrified, to another sting]
Gumball: [Monologue] Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, I can't say no! The guy's so lonely he spends his spare time counting brooms!
Hot Dog Guy​: [Monologue] Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, look at his desperate face!
Rocky: [Cutting the silence] So...
[Gumball and Hot Dog Guy both sigh in unison]
Gumball and Hot Dog Guy​: [Whispering] Yes.
The Invitation
[Gumball and Darwin are on the bus ride heading back home. Gumball's face is jammed into the bus seat, with his butt protruding]
Darwin: Hiding is not gonna make it go away, and why on earth would you invite him to a sleepover?
Gumball: [Muffled] Whoever pays for a meal gets a sleepover. It's a social contract.
Darwin: You're talking out of your backside, dude.
Gumball: At least you'll be there to support me.
Darwin: Nope! Sorry!
[Darwin walks off the bus smiling, with Banana Joe following behind]
Darwin: I'm having a sleepover at Banana Joe's. I predicted you'd do something like this, so I thought I'd get out of the house for the evening.
Gumball: Fine! I don't need you! I've still got Anais!
[Anais pops out of Darwin's backpack]
Anais: Nope. You made your bed. Now you have to awkwardly lie next to a stranger in it.
Darwin: Bye!
Gumball: [Screaming] No!
[Gumball sobs and screams loudly. His butt bangs repeatedly against the rear window of the bus as it drives off]
The Sleepover
[Gumball and Hot Dog Guy are lying in a tent in the Wattersons' backyard. Hot Dog Guy is asleep, but Gumball is wide awake]
Gumball: [Monologue] I can't tell if he's asleep! He's got no eyes! Do I have to make conversation?
[Hot Dog Guy audibly snores]
Gumball: [Monologue] Oh, thank goodness, I can finally relax.
[Gumball unzips his sleeping bag, revealing his torso to be twisted up. He undoes himself and sighs with relief. Hot Dog Guy suddenly rolls over, slapping his right hand on Gumball's chest and causing Gumball to freak out]
Gumball: [Monologue] Okay! Okay. Hah! I'll just move his hand, very slowly...
[Gumball breathes heavily and begins to move Hot Dog Guy's hand and reorient Hot dog Guy's body to be flat on his back. Hot Dog Guy suddenly wakes up and sees Gumball on top of him]
Hot Dog Guy​: [Monologue] What the?!
[Gumball smiles awkwardly]
Hot Dog Guy​: [Monologue] OH MAN! Okay.
[Hot Dog Guy returns the smile and the two hug uncomfortably. They start to move around in the tent and awkwardly exchange "du"s]
The Next Day Again
[Darwin walks up to his school locker and starts to open. Gumball's hand quickly slams it back shut, crunching up the door in the process]
Darwin: Sleep well?
Gumball: [Through his teeth] Not only did I not sleep; I may never sleep again.
Darwin: So what are you gonna do?
Gumball: I'm gonna man up, and put an end to this!
Darwin: You're just gonna make yourself so unlikable that he has to take responsibility for the end of the friendship, aren't you?
[Gumball is about to interrupt]
Darwin: But first you're gonna deny it.
[Gumball pauses, groans, and storms off. He reaches the same hallway as Hot Dog Guy. The two have a brief stare-off and clench their fists. They start walking towards each other]
Gumball: [Monologue] Right. I'm gonna make the first move. Then, as soon as he opens his arms, blank him. Boom! [Singing Monologue] Cold-blooded. [Shakes head and stops singing] Pssh. No dancing.
Hot Dog Guy​: [Monologue] Just don't give in. Don't give into it. Just keep—
Gumball: [Monologue] —going, just keep going. [His arms start to rise] What?! No, arms, get down!
Hot Dog Guy​: [Monologue; he starts to raise his arms and awkwardly smile] No, his arms! They're triggering mine!
[Gumball returns the awkward smile as his arms continue to rise. Hot Dog Guy, in the nick of time, holds his arm down and walks past Gumball]
Hot Dog Guy​: [Monologue] Sorry, anonymous blue stranger. It was you or me.
[Gumball collapses on the floor and starts sobbing]
Gumball: [Monologue] He left me hanging so I would get mad at him and be forced to man up and end our friendship. [Sniffs] What kind of monster would do that? [Suddenly stops crying] Well, apart from me. Okay. If I don't wanna be the bad guy, I'm gonna have to be the worst guy!
One-Upmanship
[Hot Dog Guy is whistling and showering in the boys' locker room. Unbeknownst to him, Gumball is standing outside of the stall with his hand on the water heater]
Gumball: [Shouting] Careful the water's not too hot!
[Gumball cranks the heater to the coldest temperature, causing Hot Dog Guy to let out high-pitched screams]
Gumball: Oh, too cold?
[Hot Dog Guy walks out of the shower, having noticeably shrunk]
Hot Dog Guy​: [High-pitched] Oh, no, no, [Clears throat, making it even deeper than normal] It's fine.
[The scene changes to the school swimming pool, where Gumball is preparing to jump off of the diving board]
Gumball: [While jumping] One... Two...
Hot Dog Guy​: [Interjecting] Have a good swim!
[Gumball, scared, accidentally gets shot from the diving board through a window]
[The scene changes again to the school cafeteria, where Hot Dog Guy is in line getting lunch. Gumball darts over to his side]
Gumball: H-h-h-hey, buddy! Lunch is on me this time!
[Gumball drags Hot Dog Guy to a seat and pushes a plate with a hot dog to him, causing Hot Dog Guy to gasp]
Gumball: Anything wrong?
Hot Dog Guy​: [Nervously laughs] No!
[Hot Dog Guy reluctantly brings the hot dog closer to his mouth, eventually biting off a small bit from the end]
Gumball: [Evilly] How do you like it?
Hot Dog Guy​: Dee-licious! [Monologue] OH MY GOSH! OH! [Begins retching internally; shifts back to talking] Mmm.
[The scene changes again to the school courtyard, where Hot Dog Guy presents Gumball with a wrapped present]
Gumball: Aw, you really shouldn't have.
[Gumball opens the box and a snake pops out and bites him, making his face swell up]
Gumball: Aw, thanks! You got me a snake.
Hot Dog Guy​: Well, I didn't want it to be lonely, so actually...
[A second snake pops out of the box and attacks Gumball, causing him to scream]
Bring It In
[The scene cuts prematurely to Gumball and Hot Dog Guy walking down the hallway, laughing with their arms joined together, when Gumball sees a fly buzzing near Hot Dog Guy's face]
Gumball: Oh, I got it, buddy!
[Gumball deliberately smacks Hot Dog Guy in the face with a rolled-up newspaper]
Hot Dog Guy​: Ha, ha! Oh, you! [Socks Gumball in the arm]
Gumball: Ha, ha, ha! No, You! [Smacks Hot Dog Guy to the floor]
Hot Dog Guy​: Alright, ha, ha! Bring it in!
[Gumball and Hot Dog Guy aggressively hug and bounce up and down]
Gumball & Hot Dog Guy​: [Yelling] Du, du-du, du-du, du DU! [Slam into locker] DU! [Slam into trophy case] DU! [Slam into the wall, dislodging a water fountain; Start rolling across the floor] du-du-du-du-du!
[Hot Dog Guy starts pulling at Gumball's face]
Gumball: [Monologue; Yelling] WHY WON'T YOU HATE ME?!
Hot Dog Guy​: [Monologue; Yelling] HATE! ME!
Gumball: [Blurts out loudly] I DON'T EVEN CARE ENOUGH TO HATE YOU! Oh, sorry, did I say that out loud?
Hot Dog Guy​: Dude. [Sits up off of the floor] I feel exactly the same.
Gumball: Really? It's just that... I didn't want to look like the bad guy.
Hot Dog Guy​: Me neither. Friends?
Gumball: Eh.
Hot Dog Guy​: I couldn't have put it better myself.
[Gumball and Hot Dog Guy shake hands]
Gumball: [Teary-eyed] I feel absolutely nothing about you one way or the other. [Sniffs] And I never will.
Hot Dog Guy​: You keep that promise.
Gumball: Forgetting you already!
[Gumball and Hot Dog Guy begin to part ways when Gumball pauses]
Gumball: Oh wait! [Hot Dog Guy turns around] Could you do one thing for me? From one stranger to another?
[The scene cuts to Hot dog Guy hugging Darwin on the bus as Darwin smiles awkwardly]
Hot Dog Guy​: Du du-du du-du du, du du du, Du du-du-du du du-
Gumball: [Condescendingly] Didn't see that one coming, did you?
[The episode ends]
