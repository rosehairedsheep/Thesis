Nicole: We need to find that nest.
Kip Schlezinger: The only traces of the victims are shredded pieces of their clothing.
Gumball & Darwin: [Imitate dramatic music]
Finding the Nest
[Screen flashes]
[Back outside, Nicole is crouching through the vent at the back of their house with a flashlight, looking for the nest. She suddenly gasps]
Gumball: What do you see?
[The camera zooms out, revealing the grate to be filled with turtle eggs, slime, and trapped victims]
Nicole: Ahh! [Nicole screams as she just notices Gary right beside her, trapped in slime]
Gary: [Faintly] The light, the light!
Nicole: No! Don't go into the light! Stay with us, stay with us!
Gary: No! I mean the flashlight, you're shining it in my eyes.
Nicole: Oh, sorry. [Puts flashlight down] Why did the turtle bring you here?
Gary: For food.
[The eggs starts to hatch. The trapped residents scream]
Nicole: We gotta get out of here. Now!
[Nicole pulls out the trapped residents; the evil turtle's babies run out of the grate and invade all of Elmore]
Turtle Frenzy
[At a gas station, Mr. Small is seen filling up his van and the Cowboy is buying candy from the vending machine; as the Cowboy puts in his last coin, the candy he chose gets stuck, so he reaches his hand up the vending machine and gets pulled into the vending machine; Larry also runs out of the convenient store while screaming and gets into Mr. Small's van and drives away while he was still filling it up, causing the hose to break and creating a trail of oil leaking from its side]
Mister Small​​: [Running after Larry] Wait, wait!
[Turtles continue to run out of the convenient store; in the van, Larry sighs in relief and adjusts the mirror before noticing a turtle clinging to it, which attacks him. The van swerves into a power line, which ignites the oil trail and creates an explosion; Harold is seen jogging through Elmore and listening to music, failing to recognize anything wrong. His music player starts making noises, so he checks it, revealing a turtle that lunges at him; Goblin is shown taking a shower]
Goblin: [Singing] La la, la la, la la, la la, la, la, [Reaches for a turtle hiding in a shell, which he believes to be soap] la la la la, la la la la la la [The turtle bites his privates; Screams] LAAAAA!
[Hot Dog Guy is shown at Elmore Shopping trying to back away from a crowd of turtles]
Porky​​: [Gasps] What do you want? Peaches? [Throws can of peaches at turtles] No? Hot dogs? [Grunts; throws can of hot dogs] No? Yes! Turtle food! [Throws can of turtle food; the turtles ignore it, scramble on top of him, and begin eating away at him] AGH! But you didn't want them!
[Nicole is shown trying to defend the kids and Richard from some turtles, chasing after them with a shovel]
Nicole: Get away from my kids, you little --
[Nicole gasps; the Wattersons flee, screaming, from an incoming wave of even more turtles; Mike is shown giving a report in a helicopter above the town]
Mike: Breaking news: foreign, killer turtles are swarming Elmore. Are they here to eat you? Or worse, take your job? Elmore News will cover these terrible events, until we find something worse to exaggerate.
[Turtles are shown clinging to the bottom of the helicopter. One bites away at its wires, causing the helicopter to crash into the parking lot of the Elmore Mall as the Wattersons run away]
Mike: [Screaming] Uh! Oh no! Oh! DON'T! [Gumball turns around as Mike, still being recorded, is surrounded by turtles] Keep rolling! KEEP ROLLING! [Shrieks and collapse to the ground]
[Gumball catches up with his family, who are watching in shock]
Gumball: [Out of breath] Why are they so evil?!
Anais: [Pulls out book] Well, in the wild, they follow their mother back to the river! Without her, they're taking over any territory they can!
Richard: Then there's only one solution! We welcome our new rulers, put on loincloths, and surrender as their slaves!
Gumball: She meant we need to find their mother.
Richard: [Covered in gold, holding a feather fan and wearing a loincloth] Well, it's still a democracy for now, so who votes for my idea?
[The other Wattersons flee and Richard sighs; Anais talks to the Pest Controller]
Pest controller: Woah, woah woah woah! Explain that again?
Anais: The babies will follow her to the river, and the town will be saved!
Pest controller: You make a lot of sense, young lady. That's the only sens -- [Nicole hits him over the head with a trash can, knocking him out]
Anais: Wha? WHAT?! He agreed with us!
Nicole: He did? Oh well, force of habit, usually people just say no to us.
To the River
[On the streets, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson are surrounded by baby turtles. Mrs. Robinson tries to defend herself with a shovel while Mr. Robinon struggles to shake a turtle off of his leg]
Gaylord: Agh! Get! Get away! Get away! Get away! [A baby turtle takes Mrs. Robinson's shovel and hits her on the head with it, causing her to collapse into Mr. Robinson's arms] Margaret!
[The pest control van veers and stops behind Mr. Robinson. Gumball and Darwin open its back doors, revealing Evil Turtle in a cage. Evil Turtle screeches, getting the turtles' attention all across Elmore]
Gumball: It's working. It's working!
[The baby turtles all dart towards the van]
Gumball: [Panicking] It's working too well! IT'S WORKING TOO WELL!
[Nicole, driving the van, floors the gas pedal. The van speeds off, being pursued by the baby turtles, one of which bites one of the van's tires]
Gumball: They're going for the tires!
Richard: [Turns on the van's windshields, wiping off several turtles] Why don't you drive faster?!
Nicole: [Angrily] Why didn't you buy a puppy?!
[The back doors fly off. The van drives through a gate]
Nicole: Yes! The river! [Attempts to brake the van] Wha-? Gah! They've eaten the brakes?
[The van drives off toward the docks, out of control]
Gumball: We're gonna have to jump!
[Gumball opens Evil Turtle's cage and reaches his hand towards her]
Gumball: I'm sorry we never understood you.
[Evil Turtle hisses, but allows Gumball to pat her head]
Gumball: Goodbye, Evil Turtle.
Nicole: JUMP!
[The Wattersons leap out of the back of the van. It goes off the dock and into the water, with the baby turtles all following suit. The sun sets as the Wattersons, captivated, watch Evil Turtle and her babies swim towards the horizon]
Gumball: See? She was never evil. She was just looking after her babies.
[The Wattersons hug. Evil Turtle suddenly veers towards a boat and attacks it, causing it to sink. The Wattersons stare on, horrified]
Anais: Eh. Maybe it was both.
