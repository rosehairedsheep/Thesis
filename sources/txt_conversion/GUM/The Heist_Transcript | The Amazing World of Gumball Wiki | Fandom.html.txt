Hearing Impaired
[The episode begins outside of the Wattersons' house, with Richard talking from somewhere off-screen]
Richard: [Muffled] And the interconnecting strands won't lose their elasticity. And that's how you make a homemade hairnet.
[Inside the living room, Richard is standing next to Gumball and Darwin, with a motorcycle helmet on his head]
Gumball: Yeah, that's great Dad. But what we asked was, "Why are you wearing that helmet?"
Richard: Oh, sorry, I can't hear you that well. I'm wearing a helmet. You're probably wondering why. You see, your mother sent me to buy myself some exercise equipment, and I was going to get an exercise bike, but I thought I'd need a helmet first.
Darwin: [Baffled] For an exercise bike?
Richard: No, for the exercise bike. I tried this one on and guess what?
Gumball: It was too small and you couldn't take it off, so you had to buy it or they wouldn't let you leave the store?
Richard: No. It was too small so I couldn't take it off, and I had to buy it or they wouldn't let me leave the store.
[Remote clicks]
Richard: Huh?
[Upbeat music plays on TV; Richard looks around, spotting Gumball on the couch]
Richard: Ah! What are you doing there?
Gumball: Sorry, that was getting really annoying.
Richard: Hmm... So, I can't hear very well, and I have extremely limited peripheral vision. Do you kids want to hop in the car and go for a drive?
Gumball: Absolutely not.
Richard: Great! Let's go grab some lunch! [Picks up two throw pillows, mistaking them for Gumball and Darwin, and walks out the front door]
[Off-screen, Richard is heard falling down the porch stairs]
Richard: Mind the steps!
Darwin: Shouldn't we do something about that?
Richard: [After a loud clang] And the trash!
Gumball: Hmm, you're right. [Gets up and slams the door shut, then returns to the sofa] There. Now we can hear the TV again.
Miscommunication
[Richard is driving down the street. Because of the helmet, he is unaware of his surroundings]
Richard: Hmm. It's so quiet today. Hardly any traffic on the roads.
[It is shown that his car is actually on the sidewalk and heading into oncoming traffic. Oblivious, Richard runs over a fire hydrant, some trash cans, and almost hits Harold]
Richard: Shame about all these potholes, though. [Notices the Joyful Burger sign up ahead; Gasps] A parking spot right outside Joyful Burger!
[In front of the Bank of Elmore, Richard shunts several parked cars out of the way before coming to a stop]
Richard: You kids wait here. I'll get lunch.
[Inside, Larry is working as a teller alongside Cupcake Man]
Larry: [Sighs] For the last time Bill, this is a bank. Not a dating agency.
Bill: [Depressed] Oh.
[Richard pushes the doors open and approaches the counter]
Larry: [Gasps] Oh my gosh, this is really happening!
Cupcake Man: Remember what they told us, Larry. Employees can be replaced, money can't!
[They look back at Richard, who is getting closer]
Cupcake Man: [Panicking] Oh, forget the training! We're being robbed! We're being robbed!
[The other customers notice the disturbance and gasp in shock]
Richard: [Sees Larry and Cupcake Man with their arms raised] Hm. Must be someone's birthday. [To the crowd; Merrily] Everybody throw your hands in the air!
[They all comply, and Richard turns back to the tellers, pointing at them with his index fingers]
Richard: Okay, you have a choice to make. Ahh heck, let's just make this easy on both of us. I'll take everything you've got.
Larry: Uh, how do you want that sir?
Richard: Uh, just in the normal brown bags is fine.
Cupcake Man: [Loading money into a bag] Don't be a hero, Larry!
Larry: I'm not being a hero!
Cupcake Man: Just give him what he wants Larry, don't be a hero!
Larry: I'm not!
[Orange Guard, who was asleep on a chair by the front door, suddenly wakes up and realizes that something is amiss. He makes eye contact with Larry, and, upon picking up on the visual cues, readies his baton. Unexpectedly, he instead uses it to shatter a nearby window and make his escape]
Larry: [Sighs]
Cupcake Man: Okay sir, that's everything. [Hands Richard two paper bags]
Richard: Pleasure doing business with you gentlemen. [Walks toward the exit]
Cupcake Man: [Still frightened] Don't do it Larry! Don't press the alarm! Don't be a hero!
Larry: [Grabbing Cupcake Man's wrapper] What is your problem?! What do you think you're doing?!
Richard: [Turns back] Oh yeah, that reminds me. We need to settle up!
Cupcake Man: No-no-no-no please don't!
Richard: Okay.
[As Richard leaves, Cupcake Man passes out and falls on the alarm button. Back on the road, Richard is again driving in the wrong lane, causing other vehicles to swerve and crash into each other]
Richard: [Talking to the pillows] What a great day. We got a free lunch, the roads are all quiet. Even you two are behaving yourselves.
Elmore's Most Wanted
[At the bank, now with a heavy police presence, Cupcake Man and Larry are speaking with the Doughnut Sheriff]
Cupcake Man: [Smugly] So even though Larry is screamin' like a baby, I managed to keep a cool head. I said to the robber, "If you're gonna hurt these citizens, you're gonna have to come through me first."
Donut Sheriff: [Writing on his notepad] Wow, so brave. I'm gonna make sure the mayor gives you a medal for this.
Larry: Uh, that's not actually what hap-
Donut Sheriff: [Interrupts] Hey! We're gonna get to your cowardly ramblings in a second! Don't let this man bother you, sir. Please continue.
Cupcake Man: Then, Larry handed over all the money and the guy ran off. [Whispers to Doughnut Sheriff] If you ask me, Larry was a bit too cooperative.
Donut Sheriff: [Whispering back] So you think this was an inside job?
Cupcake Man: Ah what do I know? I'm just a hero.
Donut Sheriff: I've heard enough. Arrest this man! [Points at Larry] Case closed.
Earl: Uh, Chief, we don't have the money.
Coffee Cop: Or the man who took it.
Donut Sheriff: I'm reopening the case!
[Doughnut Sheriff places a rolled up map on the countertop and flattens it out]
Donut Sheriff: Okay boys, I want roadblocks here, here, and here.
Larry: But you do realize that's a map of Paris?
Donut Sheriff: Like I said, we think he's gonna skip the country, most likely to Paris.
Earl: Beautiful city, Chief; City of Love.
Larry: [Angry] Why aren't you out there catching this guy?!
Donut Sheriff: [Exasperated] Sir please, don't make us give you another full body search.
Hamburger Cop: Uh, Chief? Take a look at the TV.
Donut Sheriff: [Chuckles] If it's that video of the owl riding the llama, I've seen it.
Hamburger Cop: No, that.
[They all gaze up at a monitor on the wall; It is displaying live footage of Richard's car, shot from a helicopter]
Reporter: And now, a breaking story. A bank robber is making his getaway. Normally, we would call it a high-speed police chase, but the police haven't really started following him yet. So at the moment, it's more of a leisurely drive.
[Meanwhile, at the Wattersons' house, Gumball and Darwin are still in the living room watching television. Anais runs down the stairs, stopping halfway]
Anais: Can you guys believe what's on TV?!
Gumball: I know! That owl is riding a llama!
Darwin: What a time to be alive.
Anais: No, you butt-clowns. On channel six.
[The screen changes to the news report]
Gumball and Darwin: Coool!
Gumball: Oh I love these things! Sometimes they get out and run. It's like, "Dude, what are you doing?! You're in a car!"
Nicole: [Enters from the kitchen; Gasps] That's our car! The bank robber must've stolen it! Ohh, I hope Richard's okay!
Anais: Uh, Mom? That's Dad driving it.
Nicole: [Switches from concern to fury] I'll kill him!
[Outside the Bank of Elmore, there is a scale model of a police barricade set up on the sidewalk]
Donut Sheriff: Yes sir, no one's gonna get through a roadblock like this.
Larry: [Yelling] Why not build the actual roadblock?!
Donut Sheriff: What would be the point in spending all that taxpayer money building the model, if we're not even going to use it?
Larry: Then I'm not gonna pay my taxes.
Donut Sheriff: [Doubtful] Really? Boys?
[Larry runs away screaming as Coffee Cop and French Fry give chase. After which, the news channel continues its broadcast on the bank robbery]
Kip Schlezinger: To give the illusion of varied coverage, let's go to our man in the street and get his eyewitness report. Mike?
Mike: Well, I'm at ground level, so I can't really see anything. Uhh, back to the chopper.
Kip Schlezinger: Aaand we've lost him.
Honest Mistake
[Richard finally arrives at home, and, after another catastrophic parking attempt, bursts in through the front door]
Richard: [Excited] You'll never believe what happened! I got us a free lunch!
Nicole: [Frantic] No Richard, you robbed a bank!
Gumball: Mom, he can't hear with that thing on.
[Nicole grunts, and strikes the top of the helmet with her hand. It splits down the middle and falls off, revealing Richard's compressed head]
Nicole: It's all over the news! It's on every channel!
Richard: Really? For free burgers? Slow news day.
Nicole: Richard, you didn't go to Joyful Burger. You went to the bank, and you stole two million dollars!
[Richard glances at the television, then to the bags he is carrying]
Richard: [Gasps, dropping the money] Oh my gosh! We have no lunch!
[He kneels on the floor and starts sobbing into his hands]
Anais: [Sighs] We gotta return that money. But we're gonna need to be clever about it.
[The Wattersons are standing in an alley between two buildings. On the sidewalk next to them is a nondescript briefcase, which is promptly retrieved by Goblin]
Goblin: Taxi! [Runs off-screen]
Anais: [Sighs] Why didn't we use a suitcase like that?
Richard: [Brings out a plaid, wheeled travel bag] This is all we had. Besides, I don't want to give away a nice one.
Nicole: [Irate] Richard, just go!
[Richard whimpers, grabs the handle, and starts to walk away]
Nicole: Ah. One thing. [Kisses his cheek] Good luck.
Anais: Ahh, it feels good to do the right thing, Mom. I mean sure, that two million dollars could have paid off the house, our debt, and let you take an early retirement, but-
Nicole: [Shouts] Somebody stop him!
[Nicole is flailing her arms and legs to try and escape from Gumball and Darwin, who are restraining her]
Nicole: Bring him down! Bring him down! Stop that man!
[Nearly to the bank, Richard nervously holds up a newspaper to conceal his face. He stops out front, surrounded by several police officers]
Donut Sheriff: Oh hi, Mr. Watterson!
Richard: [High-pitched] Hi... [Lowers the newspaper; Clears throat] I mean, hi.
Donut Sheriff: Say, I'd love to stay and chat, but we're on the trail of a bank robber.
Richard: [Anxious] Oh yeah, I heard about that, ha. Maybe it was an accident?
Coffee Cop: Accidental bank robbery? That actually carries a higher jail time than regular bank robberies. Hey Earl, what're we looking at for accidental?
Earl: Life, at least! And that's too good for 'em if you ask me! Am I right, fellas?!
[The cops speak simultaneously in agreement]
Coffee Cop: You're right!
Donut Sheriff: Yeah, yeah, you're right!
Coffee Cop: The worst!
Earl: I know, right?
Coffee Cop: Don't even get me started!
Donut Sheriff: Anyway, what brings you here?
[The three are confused, as Richard has suddenly vanished, leaving the travel bag behind. He rushes back to the alley and rejoins his family]
Richard: [Panting] We need another plan!
Donut Sheriff: Uh, excuse me. So sorry to interrupt. Uh, you forgot your... Here you go.
[He wheels the bag forward. The Wattersons are silently staring at it in terror]
Donut Sheriff: [Backing away awkwardly] Okay, well, uhh... enjoy your alleyway.
[They all let out a sigh of relief]
Fiscal Responsibility
Nicole's Plan
Nicole: All right, here's the plan. We do a heist.
Richard, Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: Huh?!
Nicole: But in reverse.
[Nicole visualizes her plan as she describes it in detail]
Nicole: It's a normal day at the bank, and the mailman brings a mysterious package. He takes it to an unsuspecting Larry at the counter, who signs for it and reads instructions telling him not to open it until Christmas. Naturally, Larry would want to keep the box safe. And where is safer than the bank's vault? At the end of the day, when everyone has left, I make my move. I make my way to the safety deposit boxes, avoiding the high-tech state-of-the-art security system. All I have to do, is put the money back. I put the money back...
[The Nicole that she is imagining falters]
Imaginary Nicole: Really?
Nicole: I put the money baaack in our account. We purchase first class one-way tickets to Martinique, and spend the rest of our lives living in sunshine and total luxury!
Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: Mom!
[The Watterson kids glare at their mother, who is now clutching onto the travel bag]
Anais: Shoulda seen that coming.
Gumball's Plan
Gumball: Ooh, ooh! I-I got one!
[Gumball starts to visualize]
Gumball: It's the dead of night, and I've got the cash. I go to an ATM, but instead of taking money out, I put the money in.
[Gumball shoves money into the ATM, causing it to have errors.  A siren wails]
Donut Sheriff: Hold your horses, bucky-o. I've been eyeballing you cramming that there money box full of Benjamins for the last three days. It's a first class ticket to the birdhouse for you. Kapoosh?
[Scene switches back to the alleyway]
Anais: Birdhouse?
Darwin: Bucky-o?
Richard, Nicole, Darwin, and Anais: Kapoosh?
Gumball: What? That's how cops talk.
Anais: No one speaks like that in this or any other branch of reality, kapoosh? [Groans]
Anais' Plan
Anais: Okay, here's what we do.
[Her vision begins]
Anais: We put the money back from inside. You see, the bank accepts one internship every year. I study to take the financial services exam, and pass with distinction. Working weekends and taking every hour of overtime available, I work my way up from intern to assistant manager, assistant manager to manager, and from manager to regional manager. All I need to do then, is deposit a dollar a day into the bank's central account as an aggregated transactional fee every day, thus returning the money. One single dollar, every single day. Practically undetectable.
Gumball: Wait, giving back two million dollars one day at a time? Wouldn't you have to work there for like... [Counts his fingers] two m-mil-million days?
Anais: [Now a cobwebbed skeleton covered in dust] Oh yeah. [Her skeleton crumbles onto the floor as Anais' fantasy ends]
Richard's Plan
Richard: No, wait. I've got it! Just before the police catch me, I manage to bury the money somewhere no one will find it. And so I know where it is, I leave myself a subtle clue. After being apprehended, I'm sentenced to twenty years in the state penitentiary. But I have a plan! I'm going to tunnel my way out. Unfortunately, all they had in the canteen was plastic sporks. It took me twenty years, but I was out! Then, all I have to do is collect the money... What the?!
[The imaginary Richard takes a taxi to his home, which has become a decadent mansion. There, he is greeted by his notably wealthy and posh family]
Richard: Hey! What's going on?!
Nicole: Oh, Richard darling! [Makes kissing sounds] How lovely to see you.
Richard: Did you spend all the money?
Gumball: Well, it seemed rather a shame not to.
Anais: Yes, Papa, 'twasn't even earning interest.
Richard: Wait, how did you know where I hid it?
Nicole, Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: We were watching your flash-forward.
[Returning to reality]
Richard: Oh come on! That doesn't seem fair!
Nicole: You did rob a bank.
Richard: Hmph! [Crosses his arms]
Darwin's Plan
Richard: Darwin, do you have an idea?
[The Wattersons look around, but Darwin and the money are nowhere in sight]
Richard: Darwin?
[They all gasp when he appears on-screen again]
Darwin: [Cheerful] I did it! I just dropped the money back in the bank! Problem solved.
[The family begins to celebrate together]
Gumball: We did it! Woo-hoo! Yeah!
Donut Sheriff: Uh, you guys are gonna have to clear the area. We just found a suspicious package in the bank! But don't worry, we're gonna do a controlled explosion!
[Before the Wattersons can react, a powerful explosion rocks the area. They watch helplessly as the flaming bills rain from the sky]
Gumball: [Shrugs] Well, we tried.
[The episode ends]
