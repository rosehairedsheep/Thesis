Locker Room
[Gumball and Darwin are in a foggy room]
Darwin:  WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?!
Gumball: I DON'T KNOW, BUT WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME!
Lucy Simian: [knocking on the boy's restroom door] Get out of here! Hurry up!
Darwin: I CAN'T DO IT!
Gumball: [grabs Darwin's cheeks] YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE!
Darwin: WHY ARE WE SCREAMING LIKE THIS ANYWAY!?
[Fog clears, showing Gumball and Darwin in towels]
Gumball: Because showering with other people is disgusting.
Darwin: More disgusting than soap dodging?
Gumball: It's not soap dodging. It's preserving my dignity.
Lucy Simian: [Knocks on the door] Come on it's just a shower. Everybody has to take one.
Clayton: [Comes out of the shower] Hey guys, why don't you just wet your hair and say you had a shower?
Darwin: Isn't that lying?
Clayton: I prefer to call it creative truth.
[Clayton jumps on top of the sink, wets his hand and wipes his head and then the sink falls]
Clayton: Ahh!
[Gumball and Darwin gasp; water bursts out of the sink's pipe]
Clayton: Quick give me your towels, I'll block the pipes.
[Gumball and Darwin hold their towels closer, refusing. Clayton sighs and jumps on to the sink pipe and blocks the burst with his mouth, but he bloats and pops out. Gumball and Darwin flinch]
Clayton: [bouncing of the walls] OW OW OW OW OW!
[Lockers fall to the ground, Clayton spits out water and nervously chuckles then the lockers spontaneously catch on fire, and the fire alarm goes off]
Principal Brown's Office
Nigel Brown: Could one of you boys please explain how $20,000 of damage was caused in the space of 30 SECONDS?
[Gumball, Darwin and Clayton are seated in chairs, all wet; Gumball and Darwin are still in their towels]
Gumball: Ah well I you see what happened was um... we... um-
Clayton: [Interrupts Gumball] I think what my friend was about to say is... [voice becomes deeper] We got a guy trying to steal from the lockers and we had a fight. [Voice returns to normal] I was like DROP THE WALLET PUNK and he was like BANG BANG! And I was like POUND POUND! So I threw him across the room and locker went SMASH! And he was just about to pound me when my boys Gumball and Darwin came out of the shower and the three of us trashed him so... he jumped out of the window and ran off.
Lucy Simian: [Goes up in Gumball's face] And what did this guy look like?
Gumball: [Nervously] Uh he was just, just a guy, you know.
Nigel Brown: [Writes on his notepad] A guy, uh-huh.
Lucy Simian: And what did his face look like?
Gumball: [Nervously] Face like... with facial features all around his.. face?
Nigel Brown: [Continues writing] Anything distinctive? [Squints]
Gumball: Uhhh, big skull! He had a big skull for a head.
Nigel Brown: [Writes] Skull, hmm. So, something like THIS? [Shows the drawing of a sailboat with his signature]
[Everyone stares at the drawing]
Gumball: That's a boat.
Nigel Brown: [Quietly] Yes well I'm never been really good at drawing faces [Wraps up the drawing and throws it away]
Nigel Brown: Boys I commend you for your bravery and your personal hygiene [Looks at a file], now go and put some clothes on.
Outside the Principal's Office
Clayton: Good job team!
Darwin: Dude! I think you're a bad influence, you should have just told the truth.
Gumball: And let the whole school know we're soap dodgers? No way man, we just need to draw a line under this and never see each other again.
Clayton: What? Because I lied? I did that for us, because I thought we were friends now. We are friends, right? [Looks at Gumball and Darwin with big eyes]
Gumball: Fine! Only if you promise not to lie.
Clayton: [Raises hand] Scout's honor!
Gumball: You've never been a scout, have you?
Clayton: Nnnnoooo...
Gumball: [Yells] Okay! Last chance starting now!
Clayton: [Hugs Gumball] Oh you won't regret this! [Bounces away] Come on, let's go!
[Darwin signs then he and Gumball follow Clayton, but Gumball's towel got caught in the door and it stretches then finally comes off when he goes off scene]
Cafeteria
[Cuts to the school exterior, then into the cafeteria. Gumball, Darwin and Clayton are laughing while eating lunch. Gumball tosses a chicken leg into his mouth but chokes. Darwin and Clayton look around frantically for help, but  Clayton instead issues the Heimlich maneuver. The chicken leg flies out of Gumball's mouth and into Miss Simian's mug, right when she is about to drink it. Gumball, Darwin and Clayton laugh. Clayton is awarded a medal by the nurse as the other students clap. Gumball, Darwin and Clayton execute a high-five]
Hallway
[Scene cuts to the hallway, where the trio are walking. They see Tina roaring at Anton, who then holds out a dollar bill. Clayton jumps in front of Anton and glares at Tina, who roars in response. Clayton jumps on Tina and squeezes her shoulder, and she stiffens up before falling unconscious. Principal Brown awards Clayton another medal, and they all laugh]
Class
[Cuts to a classroom. In the front with Gumball and Darwin, Clayton is mixing chemicals in a beaker. The chemicals form a crystal]
Gumball and Darwin: Oooooooh.
[Clayton places the crystal on his forehead. The scene cuts outside, high in the air where Clayton is seen flying towards the camera while carrying Gumball and Darwin. The camera freezes as they are right in front of it]
School Bus
Clayton: And then, they gave me another medal! [Scene cuts to the school bus, Clayton is sitting next to Penny]
[Gumball and Darwin pop out from behind Clayton's seat]
Darwin: Dude! You're lying again!
Gumball: Yeah, all that actually happened today was me rescuing Penny from a tribe of time-traveling troglodytes and then we made out.
Penny: Uh no. All I did today was go to school, and now I'm on the school bus.
[Gumball and Darwin look at each other and gasp]
Gumball: She's right Darwin! He's contaminated us with his dirty lies.
Darwin: We've got to stop ourselves lying, before it gets any worse.
Shock Therapy
[Scene cuts to exterior of the Wattersons' house, then to Gumball's shock collar]
Gumball: Electric shock collars?
Darwin: Yeah, every time we lie we press this button [Holds out a device with a single red button labeled "ON"] which gives us a mild electric shock.
Gumball: Okay, so Clayton, what did you do today?
Clayton: Well that's easy, I fought a tiger and then I got a medal- ayyyuwe! [Gumball activates Clayton's shock collar]
Gumball: Darwin, same question.
Darwin: [Nervously] Well, I woke up.
Gumball: Uh-huh...
Darwin: And, I ate breakfast...
Gumball: [Whispers] What did you have? [His finger comes closer to the red button]
Darwin: Cereal! I had cereal!
[Gumball's finger moves away from the button]
Darwin: And there was a wizard in the box and he taught me how to fly- WAAAAAAA!!! [Shocked by the collar]
[Darwin grabs the remote]
Darwin: Your turn. Is it true that when you were coming back from having your appendix removed...
Gumball: [Whispers] Please don't do this.
Darwin: And, you said you were still woozy from the medicine...
Gumball: Come on man! [Clenching teeth] You said you'd never bring this up!
Darwin: You.... kissed... SUSSIE! [Holds out a photo of Sussie]
Gumball: [Sighs] Just do it. [Gets shocked] WAAAAAAAAHAHAHA! You said mild electric shock, that was like lightning!
[Gumball grabs the remote and shocks Darwin, who reclaims the remote and shocks Gumball. They shock each other multiple times while Clayton watches, but they eventually stop]
Gumball: Okay, okay, okay! [Clayton laughs] Clayton, your question. Do you have a girlfriend?
Clayton: Yeah but she lives abroad.
[Darwin attempts to shock Clayton, but before he presses the button, Clayton shivers as if he is getting shocked]
Darwin: Hey! I didn't press it yet.
Gumball: Wait a minute, his one isn't even turned on!
Darwin: That's double lying, man!
Gumball: This! friendship! is! OVER!
Clayton: [Suddenly turns dead serious] You should think twice about this, I know some people who can make life very difficult for you. My girlfriend's brothers are in the FBI and I-
Gumball: Just, get out.
Hallway
[Scene cuts back to Elmore Junior High school. Gumball is putting stuff in his locker, Darwin walks up to him.]
Darwin: Gumball... I've been thinking-
Gumball: I thought you were at the dentist.
Darwin: [gets surprised and holds up his right cheek] I, uh... I was. But then I realized there's no bigger cavity in life than the hole left in your heart when you lose a friend.
Gumball: [not impressed] What are we talking about here?
Darwin: [holds gumballs hand] Clayton! We need to give him one more chance.
Gumball: Dude, he's had more chance than I've had showers.
Darwin: What's that, like five?
Gumball: [lets going of Darwins fins] Whatever. Look, if it means that much to you I'll give him one more chance, but that is it! [points his finger down] Coming to science? [walks away]
Darwin: [holding his right cheek again] I'll catch up with you.
[Darwin transforms; it was Clayton in disguise. Clayton sees the real Darwin and transforms into Gumball then Darwin walks holding his right cheek to Clayton in Gumballs form.]
Clayton: [disguised as Gumball] Ha ha, hey Darwin, I've been thinking... there's no bigger cavity in life than the hole left in your heart.
Cafeteria
[Cuts to the cafeteria with Gumball, Darwin and Clayton laughing]
Clayton: Hey who's this? [transforms into Banana Joe, jumping around with 2 milk cartons] ha ha! I'm a banana milkshake!
Gumball and Darwin: [laughing]
Gumball: [snickering] This is so much funnier than when Banana Joe does it.
[Banana Joe turns to the camera with a sad face, a tear falling from his eye, and the song Vesti La Giubba plays in the background]
Gumball and Darwin: [Laughing] HAHAHAHA!
Gumball: I'm so pleased you convinced me to give Clayton one last chance.
Darwin: [laughing then stopped] Convinced you? But... you convinced me.
[Gumball and Darwin gasp at each other and stare at Clayton]
Clayton: Huh?
[Gumball and Darwin turn away from Clayton and Gumball points his finger, motioning Clayton to get out]
[Clayton cries and jumps away to the door, but he hits the wall because he wasn't looking. He continues crying and goes through the door]
[Miss Simian barges into the cafeteria]
Lucy Simian: WHO HAS UPSET CLAYTON!?
[An angry Banana Joe, who still has a tear in his eye, points at Gumball and Darwin]
[Miss Simian comes up to Gumball and Darwin and both looked scared]
Lucy Simian: [angrily] What did you bullies say to Clayton?
[Gumball and Darwin suddenly relax, suspecting that Miss Simian is Clayton in disguise]
Darwin: [sarcastically] Wow, that's a really convincing Simian. But there's a few things you missed. [picks up 2 pieces of broccoli] The real simian has way more nosehair. [puts the broccoli on Miss Simian]
Gumball: [Gumball and Darwin each pick up a bagel] And her eyes are more bulging [Gumball and Darwin each put a bagel on Miss Simian]
Darwin: [picks up some noodles] And her hair is disgustingly greasy. [puts noodles on Miss Simian]
Gumball: Oh, [picking up milk] and she dribbles a lot [spills milk on Miss Simian]
Darwin: And she's got horns [picking up two ice cream cones] because she's evil [puts two ice cream cones on Miss Simian]
Gumball: [chuckles and picks up a sausage] Oh and she's always got a sasuage in her mouth[putting sasuage on miss Simian]
Gumball and Darwin: [laughing] HAHAHAHAHA!
[Miss Simian, with two ice cream cones and noodles on her head, 2 bagels on her eyes, 2 pieces of broccoli in her nostrils and a sausage in her mouth, stares at them both]
Gumball and Darwin: [Still laughing, but then they get nervous] ha.. ha... ha ...ha um...[stops laughing]
Gumball: You're not Clayton are you?
[Miss Simian growls angrily and squints her Eyes in a angry expression]
Principal Brown's Office... Again
Nigel Brown: [angrily] What exactly is going on here?
Gumball and Darwin: [sitting an a chair looked sad and crying] WE LIED!
Gumball: [crying] We lied about everything!
Darwin: [crying] We made up the skull guy because Clayton trashed the locker rooms.
Gumball: [crying] So punish us! Punish us like the dirty soap dodging liars we are!
Nigel Brown: I see no need for punishment. You've told the truth and that's what's important. We should never speak of this again. Now run back to class and don't forget to make up with Clayton!
[Gumball and Darwin looked confused, then got out of their chairs and walk away]
Nigel Brown: [different voice] Huuuu!
[Principal Brown transforms: turns out to be Clayton in disguise, then Miss Simian came into the office and Clayton is shocked and transformed back into Principal Brown]
Lucy Simian: [coming into the office with a folder] Nigel, I just need a couple of signatures of you please.
Clayton: [in disguise with Principal Browns voice] I, uh...
Lucy Simian: [sitting on Principal Browns desk] Razor returns from suspension today. [putting down the folder of Razor's school record in the principals desk]
Clayton: [in disguise with Principals browns voice] Razor?
Lucy Simian: You know, the kid we suspended for smashing up the locker room. [looking at Clayton in disguise seductively]
Clayton: [in disguise with his own voice shocked] HE'S REAL!? [clearing up his throat and into principal browns voice] ...uhhh I mean, what?
Lucy Simian: Isn't that band the solider's of pain? They're [whispering] pretty hardcore.
Clayton: [in disguise with Principals Browns voice] I gotta go.
Lucy Simian: How about... [whispering] How about a little kiss [getting closer to Clayton in disguise] before you go? [puckering up]
Clayton: [in disguise with principal Browns voice eyeballing around for a way out] I gotta go, out this window! [got out of the chair and jumps out and break the window]
[Miss Simian looked confused and smelled her breath]
Razor's Destruction
[Scene cuts to the school hallway where Gumball and Darwin are talking to each other, then Clayton jumps to them]
Clayton: [panicking] GUYS, GUYS, GUYS! [Gumball and Darwin stare at him angry] The skull guy, he's real, HE'S REAL!
Gumball: [sarcastically] Yeah, sure. The skull guy that I made up actually exists. Oh, don't tell me. He's seven feet tall, covered in tattoos, and he's about to burst into those very- [Razor burst and breaking into the doors with his guitar growling looking at Gumball, Darwin and Clayton]'[surprised] doors.
Clayton: [determined] You know what time it is?
Gumball: [scared] Time to change my pants?
Clayton: No, it's time to kick some butt! [Jumps toward Razor then Razor hits Clayton with his guitar causing Clayton to break into pieces]
Gumball and Darwin: [screaming] AHHHHHHHHH!
Razor: [looking at Gumball and Darwin] You're next.
Gumball: Uh, Clayton. You got a plan B?
Clayton's clay parts: [simultanolously] Yeah, literally!
[Clayton's clay parts turn into bees and goes after Razor swarming around him and Razor tries to shoo them away with his guitar then Clayton's clay parts form together into a cement block on top of Razor then hits him with it]
Razor: [growling] AHHHHH!
[Clayton jumps back to Gumball and Darwin then Razor stares at Gumball Darwin and Clayton then Razor's both arms and his back grow]
Clayton: [nervously] Guys, could I get a litle help here?
[Gumball and Darwin still looked scared, then Darwin pushes gumball slightly towards Clayton]
Razor: You're going down.
Gumball: AHHHHHHH!!! [Notices he is floating as Clayton turns into a plane below him]
Clayton: We'll see about that. [Clayton flies with Gumball toward Razor, shooting some of his clay parts, then goes around Razor, then turns around shooting his clay parts and Razor starts to run away then Clayton is going after  him then Gumball realizes something]
Gumball: AAAHHHHH! Clayton, watch out!
[Clayton dodges the students, continues to find Razor, then Razor is hiding inside a door opening his eye then Razor comes in searching for them]
Gumball: Clayton, why do you lie all the time when you can do such cool stuff?!
Clayton: Because I want to impress you guys. I think you're really cool.
Gumball: No, you're way cooler.
Clayton: No way, you're the cool one.
Gumball: Don't be silly you're the coolest guy ev- [Razor swings his guitar at Gumball and Clayton] AH!
[Darwin dodges Gumball and Clayton where they land on the lockers]
Razor: [walking to Gumball Darwin and Clayton] Ha ha ha ha ha!
Darwin: [screaming] AHHHHH! He's getting even bigger.
Clayton: Relax. I know what to do.
[Gumball and Darwin ride on Clayton in his horse form]
Gumball: [realizes Razor is chasing them] [scared] CLAYTON! HURRY UP!
[Razor chases after them, then Clayton runs towards the window]
Gumball and Darwin: [screaming] AHHHHHHHHHHH!
Clayton: GET DOWN!
[Gumball and Darwin hold on to Clayton, then Clayton breaks through the window while the camera is in slow motion landing into the school yard. Razor reach his hand to the window and clinch into the ground he tries to get through the window but can't and walks away. Gumball and Darwin is standing on the school yard while Clayton transforms back]
Gumball and Darwin: Yaaay!
Clayton: Yeah, all right! I knew he wouldn't fit through that. [Gumball, Darwin and Clayton stop cheering when they hear loud stomping, then Razor grabs and breaks through the wall]
Razor: [growling] I'm gonna smack you purple.
Gumball: [scared] AHHH! WE'RE DOOMED!
Clayton: [determined] Hold me.
Gumball: [holding Clayton] Is this really gonna help?
Clayton: No, I mean put me on your shoulder.
[Gumball puts Clayton on his shoulder, and Clayton turns into a high tech missile launcher. Razor coming after Gumball, Darwin and Clayton]
Darwin: [holding underneath Clayton's missile launcher form] Okay, should we fire now?
Clayton: No, not yet, we only have one shot.
[Razor heads toward the trio]
Darwin: [screaming] HE'S COMING HE'S COMING!
Clayton: NOT YET!
[Razor gets closer to the trio]
Darwin: [screams] AHHHHHHHH!
Clayton: Okay, time to put the skeleton back in the closet.
[Gumball pulls the trigger, firing Clayton towards Razor, who flinches, then the whole screen stops like a clip]
Telling the Truth
Clayton: and then Razor exploded into million pieces [cuts into the principals office where Gumball, Darwin and Clayton are sitting in their chairs while Clayton tells the whole story] and then the army showed up and they gave me a medal and-
Gumball: Dude that's not what happened at all. [To Principal Brown] Look I made up the skull guy and Razor happened to fit his description and got expelled.
Darwin: And he didn't attack us, he just came by to say thanks.
[Razor is sitting beside them, he is actually very small, thin, and wears glasses]
Razor: Yeah, me getting suspended gave our band way more street cred. Just last night we had like three more downloads on our website.
Nigel Brown: Well I'm glad to hear that Razor is innocent [angrily] but that still doesn't explain what you were doing when the locker room was destroyed!
Gumball: Oh I'm sure Clayton will have a very believable [winks at Clayton] explanation for that.
Clayton: We were soap dodging.
[Gumball and Darwin slap their forehead out of embarrassment]
Nigel Brown: Gross.
