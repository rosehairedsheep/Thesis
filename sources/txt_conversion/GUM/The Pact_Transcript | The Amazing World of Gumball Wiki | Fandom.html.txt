The Bus
[The episode begins with the bus going to school. There is music in the background, which is then revealed to be coming from Gumball's headphones as he sings "Without You" while everybody else is covering their ears]
Gumball: [Sings in an annoying, high-pitched voice] Without you, I can't breathe! Without you, I can't BREEEEEATHE! [Takes off his headphones] Hmm? Uh-
[Principal Brown gets onto the bus and strikes poses] 
All: Uh-
Darwin: Well, this is weird.
Carrie: I know, right?
Darwin: That new kid looks exactly like Principal Brown!
Carrie: [Sighs]
Nigel Brown: Eh?
[Teri splits herself in half]
Nigel Brown: Eh?
[Clayton extends his body to fill his seat. Gumball puts his hands on his seat, but Principal Brown sits on one of his hands]
Nigel Brown: I believe this is yours.
Gumball: [Sighs] It's alright. It's ruined anyway. [Unscrews his arm and throws it away, causing it to hit Banana Joe]
Banana Joe: Hey! [Slaps Tobias]
Tobias​: Hey! [Swings his arm back, accidentally hitting Ocho]
Ocho: Hey!
[The three students then get into a fight off-screen]
Gumball: So what happened to your car?
Nigel Brown: Hmm...
[Flashback to earlier. Principal Brown is seen getting out of his car on a steep road]
Nigel Brown: I feel like I've forgotten something.
[Principal Brown's car rolls down the hill, crashing into the auto repair shop. Flashback ends]
Nigel Brown: Uhhh... it's in the shop.
Gumball: Okay, great.
[The two sit in silence for a few seconds]
Nigel Brown: So, what do you want to talk about?
Gumball: Anything but girls.
Nigel Brown: [Laughs] Don't get me started of girls.
Gumball: I said NO GIRL TALK!
Nigel Brown: Suit yourself. So I got this weird rash on my cheeks from shaving.
Gumball: Looks fine to me.
Nigel Brown: Not those cheeks.
Gumball: Okay, I take it back. Girl talk is fine.
Nigel Brown: Okay, so Miss Simian means everything to me and when I say "everything," I mean every terrible thing as well.
Gumball: Oh, dude, I feel you. Wait, do you mind if I call you "dude"?
Nigel Brown: Only if I can call you "bro".
Gumball: Yeah, pass. So what I meant, Principal Brown, is that I get what you're saying. Penny's developed this super weird laugh recently.
[Penny is seen laughing in a strange way at the other side of the bus, while Carmen is smiling nervously, showing Penny something presumably funny on her phone]
Gumball: Eurgh... Sounds like a clown gargling a haunted accordion.
Nigel Brown: Why don't you tell her?
Gumball: [Sweetly] Because I prefer my heart beating safely inside my chest, [Horrified] rather than being held in front of my screaming face!
Nigel Brown: Yeah, to be honest, there are some things I avoid telling Miss Simian.
Gumball: Like what?
Nigel Brown: Her morning breath can peel off wallpaper. In fact it's come to the point where I don't bother redecorating.
Gumball: Why don't you confront her about it?
Nigel Brown: Because she would bite me, Gumball, she would bite me in the neck. And if that doesn't finish me without a doubt, then the resulting infection will!
[Gumball and Principal Brown both sigh]
Nigel Brown: Wait a second! Perhaps there's a way we could... you know... help each other out?
Gumball: I see what you mean...
Nigel Brown: Do you? Because that was a genuine question.
Gumball: Yeah, I take care of Simian and you take care of Penny, right?
Nigel Brown: But it'll have to look like an accident!
Gumball: [Mumbling nervously] WHAT!? I meant take care of the laugh and breath thing!
Nigel Brown: [Suspiciously sweating] Ohh yes, that's a much less illegal idea! [Spits on his right hand and hands it to Gumball] Let's shake on it!
[Gumball takes Brown's left hand and shakes it, and resumes listening to Darwin's Song]
Bad Breath
[The school bell rings, and Miss Simian drinks some of her tea/coffee and exhales tons of intoxicating gas, and birds fall down from the sky. Simian then enters the swimming hall and yawns, contaminating the swimming pool and incapacitating Tobias after he jumps into the pool. She then yawns again in a school hallway, making the chocolate in a vending machine rot, making Rocky retract his nose and leaving him unconscious and then killing the flies that escaped the vending machine. She now enters the classroom with her students]
Gumball: [Whispering] Okay, Gumball. You only have one shot at this. [Puts a mint inside a cardboard tube]
[Miss Simian sits on a chair and exhales calmly, disintegrating Banana Joe, Bobert and Leslie]
Gumball: It's over, Simian! My plan is flawless! [He accidentaly breaths in the bad smell and his voice dries out] Flaw...
[Gumball turns into dust and all that is left of him is his skeleton]
Gumball: [Faintly whispering] I can still smell it.
[It is break time and Miss Simian gets a mysterious call on her phone]
Gumball: [In a mysterious stranger's impression] Miss Simian...
Lucy Simian: Uh-huh?
Gumball: Errgh...
[Because of Miss Simian's horrible breath, it manages to get through the phones and Gumball is left unconscious]
Dental Hygiene
[Gumball is seen sitting at a desk in Miss Simian's classroom]
Lucy Simian: [Forcefully slamming test paper on Gumball's desk] We need to talk, Watterson. When asked what led to the defeat of the British in Saratoga, you wrote "Dental Hygiene." When asked what was Abraham Lincoln most famous for, you wrote "Dental Hygiene." And when asked which medical profession did the state of Connecticut become the first to license, you wrote.. [Approaching Gumball's face] "Dental... Hygiene..."
[Gumball nervously stares at her]
Lucy Simian: One out of three, that's the best you've ever scored! Well done, Watterson! Hip, hip, hoooraaayyy...
[Gumball desperately squeezes his face into his head to avoid Simian's breath]
Gumball: Alright, I need to say something. [Shakes his head and his face turns back to normal] Okay you know sometimes there are these things that seem really awkward but they're not really and it's like WAAYY better if someone just tells you but it's a little touchy so they try to put it in the most delicate way possible?
Lucy Simian: Okay?
Gumball: [Taking a deep breath] Your breath smells so bad your face should be wearing diapers.
[Miss Simian exhales and smells her breath, which results in her gagging]
The Aftermath
[In Principal Brown's office]
Nigel Brown: And how did she take it?
Gumball: Well, I didn't have to go to the hospital. The nurse said it would be more dangerous to surgically remove the pencil.
Nigel Brown: Well, I can't thank you enough for what you've done for me, so I'm not gonna thank you at all, you're welcome.
[The two sit in silence again]
Gumball: [Suspiciously] What about the other part of the plan?
Nigel Brown: The plan worked brilliantly, so brilliantly in fact that we didn't have to do the rest of it. We should quit while I'm ahead.
Gumball: What? If you think you can wuss out of this, you've got another thing coming! You promised to tell Penny tha-
Nigel Brown: WOAHWOAHAAAHHH, WATCH OUT!
[Gumball turns around to see what happened, he turns back and then Principal Brown is nowhere to be found.]
Gumball: Huh? Wha? [Looks at fur coat] I can see you, Principal Brown.
Nigel Brown: [Peeking out of the tree on a painting] No, you can't.
Gumball: What? Um. Er. [Gets off chair and slowly starts to walk out of Principal Brown's office, looking around] Ugh! [Slams the door angrily]
Bricks
[The scene begins with Principal Brown having his break, and Gumball throws a brick at the window with some paper stuck to it with rope]
Nigel Brown: Wagh! [Picks up the brick, unites the rope and starts reading] "You better keep your end of the deal or I'll tell Miss Simian." He's bluffing.
[Another brick gets thrown at the window]
Nigel Brown: OOF. HEY! [Unties rope and reads] "I'm not bluffing."
[A third brick gets thrown at the window]
Nigel Brown: AAGH! [Unties rope and reads again] "I have nothing else to say, I just had to buy a full two-hundred page notepad and I don't want it to go to waste."
[The final brick gets thrown at the window, and Brown unties the rope and reads it yet again]
Nigel Brown: "So, how's it going?" [Looks at the camera with an annoyed face]
This Is How Far He's Prepared To Go
[This scene takes place at the Elmore Auto Repair and Principal Brown returns for his car]
Auto Repair Worker: And remember to use your handbrake this time!
Nigel Brown: Yeah, yeah, whatever... [Enters his car]
[Principal Brown then turns his mirror and Gumball appears with an extremely malnourished look]
Gumball: GRAAAAARGH!
Nigel Brown: AAAGHHH!
Gumball: [Coughing] Sorry, I haven't said anything in a while.
Nigel Brown: How long have you been in here?
Gumball: It's hard to tell. After a day or so you lose track of time. It takes much longer to repair a car than I thought. [Walks over to the front right seat] Anyway, do you have like a granola bar or some chips or something 'cuz those aren't abs you see there; [Pulls up sweater] it's my spine protruding through my stomach.
Nigel Brown: Uh, sorry, no. Are you sure you aren't taking this a bit too far?
Gumball: NO! AND LET THIS BE A LESSON! THIS IS HOW FAR I'M PREPARED TO GO!
Nigel Brown: Okay, I got the message.
Gumball: Good. Now could you push me out of your car, please? I got the muscle mass of a J-rock singer.
[Principal Brown opens the front right door and then blows Gumball out of his car, who rolls away like a tumbleweed]
The Stalker
[The scene begins with the school bell ringing and suspenseful music, and Elmore Junior High having a dark, gloomy and spooky genre setting. Principal Brown prepares to leave his office and then looks outside on the playground, and Gumball stares at him with a terrifying face]
Nigel Brown: Huh! [Crouches with a terrified face, and glances at the stationary closet, with Gumball supposedly appearing inside it]
[Principal Brown and Miss Simian appear in the faculty break room and are about to kiss, and Gumball appears behind Miss Simian with the evil face. Brown screams when he sees Gumball, causing Miss Simian to lose her temper. Brown is then seen in the cafeteria reading a newspaper, which appears to have Gumball's face on it. He moves it away from his face, and then another person is holding a newspaper with Gumball's face printed on it. They put it down and Gumball looks at Brown. Brown is in his house and is struggling to sleep. He wakes up and Gumball appears in front of his bed. He then gives out a large scream]
Nigel Brown: [Waking up] AAAAAAAAAAAAGGGH! O-oh, what a terrible nightmare.
[Gumball appears on his left]
Nigel Brown: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRGHH! [Starts crying in fear]
The Truth
[The scene begins in Elmore Junior High, with Gumball filling his locker with equipment for the next class. Principal Brown then shuts Gumball's locker]
Gumball: Aah!
Nigel Brown: You should be careful about threatening me, Watterson! I control everything in this school! If say a teacher was to look into your locker tomorrow, The you might find the money from the school safe!
Gumball: You think you can buy your way out of our deal? You're completely right! I'll take it!
Nigel Brown: No, it will be stolen.
Gumball: I don't need to know where it came from.
Nigel Brown: I'll be framing you, bewhiskered fool, and then I'll expel you and send you to jail!
Gumball: Well, if I go down, I'm takin' you with me.
Nigel Brown: Well, if you do take me with you, I'm gonna sit in the back and complain the whole way and keep asking you if we're there yet.
Gumball: Well, if you're going to expel me, I'm telling Miss Simian that you put me up to this!
Nigel Brown: Ooh, go ahead, I'd love to see you try!
[Gumball walks away, causing Brown to panic]
Nigel Brown: Oh, no, no, no, no, wait! [Goes after Gumball]
Principal Brown's Plan Exposed
[Gumball angrily runs away, and Principal Brown attempts to go after him]
Nigel Brown: Get back here! [Marches elsewhere] Right. [Principal slams his office door open and enters his office] You asked for it, Watterson.
[Turns on security camera monitor. Gumball can be seen running angrily in the halls in the security camera. Brown speaks into the intercom]
Nigel Brown: You're making a big mistake, son. This school is mine. I control everything here. [Presses a keyboard button. The DVD slot opens, and Principal has a somewhat annoyed face. Cuts to the intercom, in which Brown's voice can be heard there] Gum found one of the CDs [Gumball can be seen running past the intercom] and tried to open my web. Darn it. Right, update all that stuff. I had to use it how I liked it. Oh, there it is.
[Cuts to the security camera, and Principal Brown's voice can be heard on the intercom]
Nigel Brown: Time to turn up the heat!
[As Gumball continues running, the heater tubes overheat, letting out smoke as Gumball panics and attempts to run away from them. Gumball manages to dodge all of the heater smoke, but he accidentally falls down the stairs and falls face down]
Nigel Brown: [Intercom] Attention, detention class. The first person to bring me Watterson's head is exempt from their punishment.
[Julius, Mowdown, and Rotten Cupcake bust out their detention class, each holding a weapon of very sharp art materials stuck together, including colored pencils as the tip. They smile evilly as Gumball gasps]
Nigel Brown: [Intercom] Wait, I probably should've clarified. The body must must still be attached to his head.
[The bullies groan, and drop their weapons down. They grab the baseball bats from behind their backs and continue to smile evilly]
Nigel Brown: [Intercom] Oh, and, uh, both must still be alive.
[The bullies groan and toss their baseball bats off-screen]
Nigel Brown: [Intercom] Well, go on, get Watterson!
[The bullies smile evilly again, and Gumball runs away from them, screaming. He pauses by Darwin]
Julius: Get em, get em! Get one of em!
Rotten Cupcake: He's getting away!
Darwin: Don't you dare.
Gumball: Sorry, dude. [Pushes Darwin in front of him]
[Darwin remains lying down with his upset pose, and Gumball runs away. Rotten Cupcake, Julius, and Mowdown jump over Darwin and grab him]
Nigel Brown: [Intercom] No, wait! The other Watterson!
[Cut to the security camera again, in which Gumball can still be seen running away. He gasps at seeing Miss Simian walk by]
Gumball: Miss Simian.
[Gumball eagerly tries to run to Miss Simian while panting. He raises his hand up and tries to get Miss Simian's attention]
Gumball:  Miss Simian! [He continues running and Miss Simian notices him]
[Cut to Principal Brown pressing a keyboard button, and a garage door slowly descends to prevent Gumball from catching up to Miss Simian. Gumball angrily tries to run by it, but fails, and the garage door closes]
Nigel Brown: [Intercom; laughs evilly] You big-headed fool!
[Gumball growls. Cut to Principal Brown's office, where Principal Brown can still be heard laughing until Gumball breaks through his door]
Gumball: Your report card just came in. You got a D... for going down!
Nigel Brown: Oh-ho-ho, I'm not the one going down. [Gumball screams as if he's falling, even though there's no trapdoor]
Gumball: NOOOOOOOOO-oooooo...
Nigel Brown: [Deadpan] What was that about?
Gumball: Sorry, I thought it would be a trapdoor or something. [Points at button] What was that button for?
Nigel Brown: [Dramatic trumpet sounds play while he gets up from his chair] Appropriate music. This is you, Watterson. [Makes dramatic kung-fu sounds while taking a post-it note stuck on the computer and tears it in half]
Gumball: OH, YEAH?! WELL, THIS IS YOU! [Dramatic trumpet noises play again. Points at a dish on the cabinet and kicks the cabinet, causing the dish to fall over, although still on the cabinet]
Nigel Brown: Oh yeah? Well, here's your tears. [Dramatic trumpet noises play. Drinks from his coffee and slams it back against his table] Delicious.
Gumball: OH, YEAH?! WELL, THIS IS YOUR FACE! [Casual, while holding a portrait of Principal Brown] Literally. [Back to angry state, slamming his face against the portrait, ripping the photo] AND THIS IS YOUR— [Pushes down Principal Brown's cabinet] AND THIS IS YOUR PLAN— [Struggles to lift the plant and its pot. Drops the pot, smashing it and screams angrily, walking towards the chair] AND THIS IS YOUR CHAIR! [Smashes the chair against the floor, yelling loudly] FIGHT ME!!
Nigel Brown: No need, Watterson. You're done. I've got all that on my security camera. I set it recording when I pushed that button earlier.
Gumball: [Gasps quietly and speaks softly] You've deceived me, you Saruman. [Notices the intercom button]
Nigel Brown: Well, that'll teach for trusting a handshake wouldn't it, Watterson?
Gumball: You USED ME! [Secretly presses the intercom button]
Nigel Brown: That's right, [The students outside of the office can hear the intercom of Principal Brown] I used you a a pawn to get rid of Miss Simian's fetid breath, which was so bad it triggered our smoke detectors, [Cut back to Principal Brown's office] and when you threatened to tell Lucy the truth, [Cut to another group of students who are listening to the intercom of Principal Brown] I used my powers to crush you, putting your life [Cut to Principal Brown's office again] at great risk. [Reconsiders what he said] Actually, that sounds pretty bad when I said it out loud. [Gasps] What have I done?! I've broken my oath as guardian of the school. I've become a principal without principles! All because I was scared of telling Penny Fitzgerald about a stupid laugh!
[Gumball's angry look turns into a terrified one upon hearing him mention Penny and her laugh]
Nigel Brown: A laugh that sounds like she's gargling air inside her mouth! Your words, not mine. I should've just done my part on our secret pact. You'll get rid of Miss Simian's toxic pie hole vapors, [Gumball points off-screen, but Principal Brown doesn't notice] and I get rid of that laugh that sounds like a circus mule operating a pneumatic drill. [Gumball sighs sheepishly. Brown makes a face of realization] ...They're standing right behind me, aren't they?
Gumball: [Sheepishly] No...
Nigel Brown: [Relieved] Oh, ho, ho-
Gumball: [Off-screen] They're on your left.
[Camera reveals Miss Simian and Penny, glaring angrily at Principal Brown and Gumball. Gumball has a blushing, defeated face and Principal Brown has a surprised face. The episode ends]
