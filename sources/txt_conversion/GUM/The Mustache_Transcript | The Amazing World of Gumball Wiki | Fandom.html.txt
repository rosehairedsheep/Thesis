The Cereal Box
[Scene starts at the Wattersons' dining table where Richard is carrying a checklist]
Richard: Bowls -- check! Spoons -- check! Cereal -- check! Oh.
[Richard attempts to open the cereal box.]
Richard: Ugh! So much for easy opening! It looks so simple on TV!
[Gumball and Darwin walk in, looking unhappy.]
Gumball: Oh, man, I really don't want to go to school today.
Darwin: Me neither.
Gumball: Let's not go!
Darwin: You can do that?
Gumball: Sure! Hey, Dad?
Richard: [Still trying to open the box] Yes?
Gumball: [Takes the box from Richard, opens it, and returns it] We really don't want to go to school today.
Richard: Why? Are you sick?
Gumball: Nah. We're not just up for it.
Darwin: Yeah! School is boring!
Richard: But you have to go to school. You're kids! It's what you do!
Gumball and Darwin: Aw!
[Doorbell rings.]
Richard: Ooh! Mailman! Whoo-hoo!
[Richard runs off]
Gumball: I wish we were grown-ups, like Dad. Then we'd never have to go to school and nobody would tell us what to do. We could drive trucks, stay up all night, vote.
Gumball and Darwin: [Gasp] Vote...
[Richard comes back with a supplement box.]
Richard: Oh! Finally!
Gumball: What's that?
Richard: [Gasps, then starts to sweat and look anxious while hiding the box behind him.] Why? According to the Fifth Amendment, I don't have to answer that without my lawyer present!
Gumball: Right. Anyway, about school...
Richard: [Places the supplement box on the table.] Oh, yeah. You're kids, so you do what mom tells me to tell you to do.
Gumball: [sighs] Being a kid is wretched-lame.
Richard: You should be happy to be young. Before you know it, you'll be overweight, unattractive, balding, middle-aged.
[Richard starts sobbing.]
Richard: [Mistakenly takes the cereal box.] Take over breakfast! I don't want you to see me like this!
[Richard runs off crying, then shortly Anais walks in.]
Anais: What's his problem?
Gumball: Eh. You never know with that guy. Come on. Let's have breakfast.
[Gumball pours in the supplements from the box to the bowl.]
The Shooting Star
Gumball: Man, what a pile of beans.
Darwin: [Gasps] Dude, watch your language! You'll get us in trouble!
Gumball: Well, I'm sorry, Darwin, but it is. It's a big, steaming pile of beans.
[Gumball and Darwin gasps as they a hear the sound of the "shooting star".]
Darwin: Gumball, look! A shooting star!
Gumball: This is our chance. Make a wish!
[Gumball and Darwin close their eyes.]
Gumball: I wish I was a grown-up.
Darwin: Me too!
[Gumball and Darwin wait for a short while, then open their eyes to see each other still not grown-ups yet.]
Gumball: That didn't work at all. Ugh!
[Gumball throws a can at the Shooting Star.]
Shooting Star: Ow!
Gumball: Faker!
Shooting Star: Oh, darn kids! What do you think you're doing?!
Transformations of the Human Body
[Scene changes to the class room where Miss Simian is teaching about the human body.]
Lucy Simian: Today's lesson will be about the transformations of the human body.
[Gumball and Darwin are uninterested, Gumball continues with his doodle.]
Lucy Simian: [Pulls out a chart] As you get older, hormones begin to change your appearance.
Gumball: [Throws a piece of paper at Darwin] Here. [Darwin unfolds the paper and sees a picture of Gumball as an adult.] It's me as an adult talking to my secretary over the intercom.
Darwin: [Throws a piece of paper at Gumball and Gumball unfolds it and sees a picture of Darwin as an adult.] It's me voting!
Gumball: Awesome.
Lucy Simian: Passing notes, are we?
Gumball: No, Miss Simian.
Lucy Simian: [Grabs both of the papers.] Well, then, what's this?
Gumball: Uh, that's us as adults?
Lucy Simian: I guess you're on topic, then. [Turns around and faces the board again.] Anyway, pimples --
Class: Ew!
Lucy Simian: [Turns around to face the class.] Silence! Actually, it's pretty gross. You may continue.
Class: Ewwwwww!
Lucy Simian: [Turns around and faces the board again.] Pimples, or acne, [Camera changes to Darwin as a pimple grows on his face.] can pop up at any time...
Gumball: [Points at Darwin's pimple.] Dude, what's that on your face?
Darwin: What? What?!
Gumball: [Points closer at Darwin's pimple.] That.
Darwin: What?!
[Camera changes to the inside of Darwin's pimple as Gumball looks at it.]
Gumball: It looks like a greasy, yellow egg. No, no, actually, it's more like a small volcano with a sweaty golf ball.
[Camera changes back to Gumball and Darwin.]
Darwin: Do something! Do something!
Gumball: Okay, okay. Hold on. Let me just, um... [Grabs a small hat and use it to cover Darwin's pimple.]
[Darwin breathes a sigh of relief, but more pimples start to grow on his head.]
Gumball: I think we're gonna need more little hats.
Darwin: Aaaah!
Gumball: Relax, dude!
Darwin: That's easy for you to say! Why don't you have any?
Gumball: Just lucky, I guess.
[Gumball turns his head around and the back of his head is filled with pimples too.]
Darwin: [Points at Gumball's pimples.] Aaah!
Gumball: Aaaaaah!
[Both of them run out the classroom screaming and run into the girls' restroom; Scene changes to the restroom door where Gumball and Darwin are still screaming in pain.]
Gumball: [Off scene] I think that's all of them.
[Scene changes to the inside of the girl's restroom where Gumball and Darwin are covered with pink papers.]
Gumball: What's happening to us?
Darwin: I think we've got the plague.
Gumball: Do you have any other symptoms?
Darwin: My top lip feels a little silky.
[Scene changes to Miss Simian who is still teaching the human body to the class.]
Lucy Simian: Next comes the appearance of hair on the body and face.
[Scene changes to back to Gumball and Darwin where Darwin starts growing a mustache.]
Gumball: [Laughs] Dude, you look like an undercover cop.
Darwin: Stop laughing! Do something!
Gumball: Okay. [Takes out a piece of bubble gum and starts chewing it.] I see Mom do this all the time. And Dad, on one occasion.
[Gumball takes the gum out of his mouth and puts it along Darwin's mustache, then pulls the gum and Darwin's mustache off.]
Darwin: [Sighs] That feels so much bet-- Aaaaaah!
[Darwin starts growing a bigger mustache and bigger eyebrows.]
Darwin: [Points at Gumball] Aah!
[Both of them have a big mustache and eyebrows with hair on their armpits.]
Gumball: Don't worry, dude.
Darwin: I'm not worried about me! I'm worried about you! You look like a baby werewolf!
Gumball: No! Not me! It was better when it was just you!
Penny: [In a stall] Uh, guys, I don't mean to interrupt, but this is the girls' toilet.
Gumball: Uh, yeah, sorry! [Hands some gum to Darwin.] We've got to sort this out. Start chewing.
Into Grown Men
[Scene changes to the School Gym where the students are; Gumball and Darwin are completely bald.]
Lucy Simian: Okay, settle down. Everyone, get into your team for dodgeball.
Gumball: [Facepalms] Oh, no. Not dodgeball.
[Tina walks up to Gumball and Darwin.]
Tina: You're going down. [Tries to punch her fists together, but they are too short.] You get the idea.
[Everyone gets to their teams and a siren goes off.]
Gumball: Please -- not above the should--
[Gumball and Darwin get hit by dodge balls and both of them scream in pain.]
Gumball: The ear!
[Gumball and Darwin still get hit by dodge balls and both of them still scream in pain.]
Darwin: My ankle!
[Gumball jumps onto Darwin as a bowling ball almost hits Gumball.]
Gumball: Aah! A bowling ball?!
[Tina laughs maniacally while Gumball gets angry and starts breathing heavily; Tina uses her tail to launch a dodge ball at Gumball.]
Tina: Catch!
Gumball: [Gumball catches the dodge ball and his voice turns into a deep voice.] Enough!
[Leslie and Alan gasp as Gumball transforms into a grown man and throws the dodge ball back at Tina, causing her to fly out of the gym. Everyone sees what happened to Tina. Gumball then steps forward while everyone looks at Gumball flexing his chest, shoulder and butt.]
Leslie​​: Oh!
[Alan pops]
[Gumball and Darwin look at each other as grown men.]
Gumball: Aaaaaah!
Darwin: Aaaaah!
Gumball and Darwin: [Point at each other] Aaaaaaaaah! [Their voices break, then turn deeper.] Aaaaah, Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
[Scene changes to the boys' toilet where Miss Simian is waiting outside and Gumball and Darwin are inside the toilet.]
Darwin: [Inside the restroom] This is horrible! We're monsters!
Lucy Simian: No, you're not. It's just a part of life.
Gumball: [Opens the door] Are you saying we're grown-ups now?
Lucy Simian: Apparently so.
Gumball: Did you hear that? That shooting star worked.
Lucy Simian: Now, get back to class!
Gumball and Darwin: [Look down] All right, Miss Simian. [Miss Simian nods her head.]
Gumball: Wait a minute! We don't have to listen to you anymore. 
Gumball and Darwin: Because,​ [Scene changes to a concrete door.] we're men!
