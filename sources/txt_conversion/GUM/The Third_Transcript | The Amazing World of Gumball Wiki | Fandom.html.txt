The Bedroom
[The alarm clock rings]
Gumball: [Cheerfully] We still have twenty-four hours 'til we go back to school!
Darwin: [Pops out from his fishbowl] Twenty-four whole hours of fun!
Gumball: So, what shall we do?
Darwin: Shoot some hoops?
Gumball: Nah, it's boring.
Darwin: Water fight?
Gumball: Nah, that's boring too... and wet.
[Both sigh]
Gumball: I know!
The Backyard
Gumball: It's time to play...
Gumball and Darwin: Dodge or Dare!
Gumball: Roll the dice, pick a...! [Unamused] Who am I kidding? We're bored of this as well. Why are these games so boring now?
[Darwin is thinking]
Gumball: Ah! [Worried] Darwin, maybe it's not the games, [Whispering] maybe we are bored of each other.
Darwin: NO! [Sadly] Don't say that! It can't be!
Gumball [Sadly] It's the truth, Darwin, and you know it, and the sooner we accept it, [Grabs Darwin's head] the better it will be for everyone.
Darwin: So what are you saying? You don't wanna hang out with me anymore?
[They hug]
Gumball: Of course I wanna hang out with you. [Hugging stops] I'm just saying that things have got a little... stale.
Darwin: So, what should we do about it?
Gumball: Hmm...
[Gumball sees two ants trying to lift a cookie unsuccessfully, then a third one comes to help and they succeed. They then run off with the cookie]
Gumball: That's it!
Darwin: [Skeptical] We should become ants?
Gumball: No, we need to find a third best friend.
Darwin: Three best friends?
Gumball: Mmhm.
Darwin: Won't that be a bit... weird?
Gumball: It's only weird if we make it weird. Do you find it weird?
Darwin: [Cheerfully] Not if you don't.
Gumball: OK then, let's get ourselves a new buddy.
[Both smile]
Darwin: [Suddenly realizes] My cookie...
The Quest for a Third Friend
[As school bell rings, Gumball and Darwin are looking around the hallway]
Gumball: School is full of people and all we've got to do is pick one to be our new best friend.
[Tina appears]
Darwin: How about her?
[Tina steps on Ocho, Idaho and Anton, then wipes her feet on Anton]
Gumball: How about not?
[William appears, stares at a bin]
Darwin: [Points] William?
Gumball: I don't know... [William stares at them] He's just a bit...
[William blinks and flies away]
Gumball and Darwin: ...creepy. [They have a chill]
[They hear Banana Joe laughing]
Banana Joe: Peek-a-boo! [Laughs loudly to himself]
[They walk towards Joe]
Gumball: Hey, Joe!
Banana Joe: Peek-a-boo!
[The three laughs]
Gumball: You wanna play with us for a bit?
Banana Joe: Yeah!
[Silence for one second]
Banana Joe: Hey guys! Seen this? [Makes farting noises with his armpit nine times] Ha! [Laughs loudly]
Gumball: [Pretends to laugh along] Ahahahaha! Ahahahaha! [Nudges Darwin]
Darwin: [Gets the point] Oh! Hahahaha! Hahahaha!
Banana Joe: Wait! Wait! Look at this! [Shakes himself while making noise and laughing when his eyes rolled for a while] Wahahaha!
Gumball: [Says in an unsure tone] Great!
Banana Joe: I can do other stuff, too! [Throws his banana suit away and walks towards it, whistling] Ah! [Trips on his own banana peel] See that? I slipped over myself!
[Banana Joe starts laughing]
Darwin: [Whispers to Gumball] What do you think?
Gumball: Uhh... He's a bit of a one-trick pony...
Darwin: Yeah, let's go.
Gumball: Okay, Joe! We'll... be in touch! [Starts leaving with Darwin]
Banana Joe: Hey, one more thing! Before you go! Ready? [Prepares to make farting noises with his armpit, takes a deep breath; out comes an actual fart noise]
Banana Joe: Oh.
[In the playground, Gumball and Darwin are talking to Bobert]
Bobert: So, how do we play this game, "punchies"?
Gumball: It's easy! You just give each other friendly digs in the arm. Like this! [Punches Bobert and hurts his own hand] Ahhhh!
Bobert: Your turn has terminated. Commencing my turn. [Retracts his arm and punches Gumball]
Gumball: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!
[Gumball smashes through a wall and slams into the lockers, falling flat on the floor]
[In the cafeteria, Gumball and Darwin are getting their lunch feeling bummed out]
Gumball: [Sighs] Finding a friend is harder than I thought...
Leslie​​​: [Overexcited] Hey! I heard you're looking for a third!
Gumball: Yeah, but it's proven a little—
Leslie​​​: Stop looking. I'm in!
Gumball: W-Well, Leslie, i-it's not as simple—
Leslie​​​: So, what are you having for lunch? [Surprised] Oh! Beef stew? Me too!
[They sit at a table]
Darwin: We're having pizza...
Leslie​​​: [Extremely overexcited] Let's sit together! I'm going in the middle. [Hugs Gumball and Darwin against their will] Oh, this is so much fun! From now on, we can do everything together... [In slow-motion] FOREVER!
[In the bathroom, Gumball and Darwin are hiding in a stall]
Gumball: [Relieved] Whew, I think we lost him.
Darwin: Finding a friend is really hard.
Gumball: Yeah, what do we really want from a friend?
Darwin: Well, they should be athletic to protect us from bullies, rich so we can play with their toys, have a colourful personality and most of all, be really good at listening.
Tobias​​​​: [Overlooking from the next stall] Hey, you guys! I couldn't help, uh, listening to everything you just said, and I... uh... think you're in luck. Athletic? [Flexes his arm and a muscle pops up] Check! Rich? [Dollar bills pop up from his hand with a cash sound effect and he throws them] Check! Colourful? [Changes colors in a gradient animation] Check-a-leck-a-ding-dong.
Gumball and  Darwin: [Extremely amazed] Wow!
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​: You know what, guys? I'll be your friend.
Darwin: Really?
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​: [Assenting] Uh-huh. For twenty bucks.
Gumball: [Indignant] What?!
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​: I'll give you a moment to think about it. [Goes down the stall wall]
Gumball: I dunno about this, Darwin.
Darwin: But this is what we've been looking for. [With a big smile] He is perfect!
Gumball: [Doubts] I suppose it's only ten bucks each.
Darwin: Yeah... About that... Can I borrow ten bucks?
Gumball: [Sighs] Fine...
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​: [Off-screen] Great! [Flushes toilet]
[Gumball and Darwin look at each other in confusion]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​: [Leaves the bathroom with Darwin] Man, this is gonna be awesome!
Gumball: Hey, hey, guys! Wait up! Guys!
At Home
[The Wattersons are having lunch, Darwin is laughing]
Darwin: And then, Tobias said, "I know you are, but, what am I?" And everyone laughed!
[The whole family laughs except Gumball]
Gumball: And then I said, "You"—
Darwin: Oh, yeah! And then Tobias showed me this really cool thing [He does it while explaining] where you shake your hands behind your back and say: "Nice to meet me." And everyone laughed!
[The whole family laughs except Gumball]
Darwin: He's a really cool guy!
Gumball: Well, he's OK, but... [Gets interrupted by Darwin]
Darwin: What do you mean he's OK? He's the best guy EVER!
Gumball: [Upset] It's not like you've played with him your whole life.
Darwin: I might as well have. I feel like I've known him forever.
[Gumball throws his mashed potato to Darwin's face]
Nicole: Gumball!
Gumball: I'm sorry, that must have just flown off my fork. Anyway, the funniest thing happened to me today: I was going into class when...
Richard: [Laughs] That's great. [Turns to Darwin] Now, tell me more about this Tobias guy.
[Gumball mutters]
Trustball
[In the gym, Miss Simian blows the whistle]
Lucy Simian: Everyone, pair up! And make sure it's with your best friend, because we're playing Trustball.
Gumball: Great! Now I finally get to spend some time with... Ahhhh! 
[Darwin and Tobias are doing a secret handshake]
Gumball: [Comes up to them] DARWIN!!!!!
Darwin: Hey, Gumball. Tobias was just telling me about his new computer-games console.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​: Yeah, yeah, it’s a Z-Station. They're not even out yet.
Darwin: Let’s play tonight! [To Tobias] Sleepover at yours?
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​: Ya, sure! We can have a sleepover. Twenty bucks.
Gumball: Ten bucks. I’m not coming.
Darwin: You’re not?
Gumball: No! I’m having a sleepover with my new best friend [Pulls Alan down with his string] Alex!
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​: Alan.
Gumball: Alan. We’re gonna play Dodge or Dare all night!
Darwin: You are?
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​: [Surprised] We are?
Gumball: Yeah. And it’s gonna be loads more fun than some stupid computer game!
Darwin: Great! Looks like it all worked out then. See you later! [Goes away with Tobias but then returns back] Oh, can I borrow ten bucks? [Gumball gives him ten bucks] Thanks! Wait for me, Tobias!
I'm not Gonna Lose You
[In the backyard, Gumball and Alan are playing Dodge or Dare]
Gumball: Ah, come on, Adrian! Roll the dice! Roll the dice!
Alan​​​​​​: I can’t! I got no hands!
Gumball: Argh! Fine! I’ll do it for you! [Rolls the dice] Six. Right. Pick a card!
Alan​​​​​​: I still have no hands!
Gumball: Argh, do I have to do everything?!
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Listen, Gumball, do you really wanna be doing this? I mean, we’ve never even hung out before, and now we are having a sleepover.
Gumball: Did I ask for your opinion, Alfred?!
[Alan deflates a little]
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Can I at least call my mom?
Gumball: Fine! But keep it quick! [Gives Alan a telephone]
[Brief silence]
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Still no hands.
Gumball: [Annoyed] Number!
[Meanwhile, in front of Tobias’ house]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​: This is going to be the most fun you’ve ever had!
Darwin: All for just ten bucks!
[The two of them enter the house. Scene cuts back to the Wattersons' backyard]
Gumball: [Throws a football at Alan] Catch!
[The ball hits Alan and drives him away]
Alan​​​​​​​​​​: Ahhhh!
Gumball: What are you doing?
Alan​​​​​​​​​​: [Off-screen] No hands!!
Gumball: Oh...
Alan​​​​​​​​​​: Look, Gumball. What’s really going on here?
Gumball: Oh, Arthur. Who am I kidding? I’m not having as much fun as I’ve been making out. All I can think of is Darwin!
Alan​​​​​​​​​​: Go to him!
Gumball: Huh?
Alan​​​​​​​​​​: Your best buddy is about to play computer games with someone who’s rich, athletic, multi-colored and a good listener! He’ll never play Dodge or Dare with you again!
Gumball: [Gasps] They will be best friends forever and I’ll just be a memory! I have to get my best buddy back! But it’s too late!
Alan​​​​​​​​​​: Dude, it’s never too late for friendship!
Gumball: Yes!
[Gumball runs off]
Gumball: [Off-screen] I’ll never forget you, Adam!
[Alan looks at him nonchalantly]
Gumball: [Off-screen] Andrew...? Alice?
Gumball’s Race
Gumball: Hey, kid, please lend me your bike! I’m about to lose my best friend!
Rosie: Okay! Fifty bucks!
Gumball: Argh! Twenty bucks.
Rosie: Seventy!
Gumball: Argh! [Throws money at Rosie]
[Gumball rides on Rosie's trike at high speed on the street dodging all the obstacles he encounters. Gumball beeps the horn as he's about to run into a brick wall]
Gumball: Get out of the way!
Mark: I can't!
Gumball: Get out of the way!
Mark: I’m a brick wall!
Manhole: Hey, Mark, what’s with all the commotion? Argh!
[Gumball flies over the brick wall pulling a stunt, only to fall down a staircase]
Gumball: Ah! Oh! Ah! Ahhhhhhh! 
[Gumball lands into a pile of trash. There's a short pause before Gumball remerges screamimg in slow-motion and rushing back into the street. Pantsbully is about to eat a sandwich as he notices Gumball dashing past him]
Pantsbully: Hey, kid, you can’t go that way!
Gumball: No time! [Goes through wet cement] I wish... I'd listened... to that guy. [Cement turns into concrete, incapacitating him]
[Gumball imagines Darwin and Tobias having fun]
Darwin: Feel like I’m missing something...
Tobias​​​​​​: Missing something? What?
Darwin: Ah, never mind. I already forgot.
[End of vision]
Gumball: By the power of friendship!
[Gumball breaks the concrete and continues his rush]
Gumball: [Sees that the road is very long] Oh, man...
[Gumball is struggling to make it up the road]
Gumball: Ngh! Ngh! Ngh! Ngh! Ngh! Ngh! Agh! AGH!
[Gumball smiles as he thinks it is over but it is not]
Gumball: [Groans] [Echoing] GOSH DARN IT!!!
[Scene fades to Gumball gradually going farther up the road as the day changes to evening]
Gumball: Ngh! Ngh! All because of those stupid ants and their stupid cookie! This is all their fault! [Mockingly] "Ooh! Look at me! I’m a third ant!" [Babbles] THOSE STUPID, STUPID ANTS! Oh! Made it to the top! [Pushes the trike down the bottom of hill] Weeeeee! Woo-hoo! Oh!
[Gumball realizes he's going too fast and pushes the brakes, but the cable snaps]
Gumball: Ahhhh!
[The trike's right wheel comes off and breaks into pieces as Gumball falls down a slope, he then catches on fire like a meteor because of the huge velocity he’s got. He whizzes past Doughnut Sheriff’s police car making it overturn]
Gumball: Ahhhhh!
Donut Sheriff: [Notices that his radar gun somehow caught fire] Yeow!
Gumball: I’m coming for you, buddy! Hold on— [Swallows a bug]
At Tobias’ House
[Gumball whizzes throughout Tobias’ house and then returns back to Tobias’ room]
Gumball: WHERE'S DARWIN?!
[Tobias (next to an orange bounce ball) turns to Gumball and pauses the game]
Gumball: WHAT DID YOU DO WITH MY FRIEND?!
Tobias​​​​: Uh... He’s in the garden... I think... [Resumes playing game]
[Scene fades to Darwin looking out of a window, sobbing. Gumball approaches the window from the outside. Darwin thinks that Gumball is inside and turns around]
Darwin: Gumball!
Gumball: Dude, I’m outside.
Darwin: Oh...
[The two of them run out into the garden, giving each other the secret handshake before hugging each other]
Gumball: I can’t believe you were gonna play computer games with Tobias.
Darwin: But you played Dodge or Dare with someone else.
Gumball: Oh, it didn’t mean anything. I don’t even like Adam.
Darwin: Alan.
Gumball: Nyah, whatever.
Darwin: Best friends?
Gumball: Forever!
Gumball and Darwin: Yay!
Darwin: [Chuckles]
[Scene fades to Gumball and Darwin playing Kebab Fighter on Tobias’ Z-Station]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​: Hey guys, shall I plug in a third controller, or what?
Gumball and Darwin: No!
[Tobias looks sadly at them and his cable droops]
