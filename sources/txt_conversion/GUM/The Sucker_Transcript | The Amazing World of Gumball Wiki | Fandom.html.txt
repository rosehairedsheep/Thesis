Darwin and Julius in Detention
[The episode starts off with the front entrance of the school. The scene then cuts to a door with a piece of paper attached to it, reading "DETENTION." Buzzing and the sound of cell doors opening are heard. Julius, leisurely sitting in his chair, turns around and sees Principal Brown bringing Darwin into the room]
Nigel Brown: Maybe a little time in here will help you think about what you did, Watterson.
[Principal Brown makes the buzzer and cell door sound effects with his mouth. He closes the door, and Darwin sits next to Julius]
Darwin: Hello! You're Julius Oppenheimmer Junior, right? I'm Darwin. We met last year in the schoolyard.
Julius: Are you the one who screams when his arms come off?
Darwin: [Shakes his head] Mm-mm.
Julius: Are you the one who passes out when he is held upside down for four hours?
Darwin: Nope!
Julius: Are you the one who has trouble walking when his legs are pulled off and put back on the wrong way around?
Darwin: I'll give you a clue. Two weeks of physiotherapy and a forever whistling nose. [Whistles his nose for a few seconds]
Julius: [In realization] Oh, yeah. You hang out with the blue one, with the big head I turned inside out.
Darwin: So, how come you're in dental-tension?
Julius: It's called detention, And I'm here because I had a little trouble with my art project.
[Flashback to Julius throwing pink toilet paper at a tree. The thrown toilet paper forms the word "VANDALISM." Principal Brown enters]
Nigel Brown: [Reading] "Vandalism"? Detention!
[Flashback ends]
Julius: And what are you in for?
Darwin: Same sort of thing.
[Flashbacks to Darwin throwing pink toilet paper at the same tree. He adds "IS BAD" below "VANDALISM." Principal Brown enters again]
Nigel Brown: [Reading] "Vandalism is bad"? Admirable sentiment, but still vandalism. Detention!
[Flashback ends]
Darwin: So, what do you do in detention?
Julius: Well, I was gonna start with a bit of popping.
Darwin: Popping? Man, I love breakdancing! [Performs the arm wave]
Julius: Then, I guess some mauling.
Darwin: Going to the mall? Uh huh!
Julius: And to finish, some trampling.
Darwin: They have a trampoline now?! Oh man! Detention sounds great! I guess they must be going for a Scandinavian-rehabilitation approach.
Julius: [Laughs] You're pretty naïve. I bet you're easy to manipulate—
Darwin: I'll do it!
Julius: What?
Darwin: Oh, sorry. I thought you wanted me to do something. Would— would you like me to do something?
Julius: Hold that thought. [Talks into his phone] I got one. He'll do whatever I say, and we'll never get in trouble again. He's a real sucker. How do I know? 'Cause he's holding the phone for me right now.
[Camera zooms out to reveal Darwin holding the phone for Julius]
Julius: Wanna come hang out with a bunch of older kids who have a reputation for being mean and manipulative?
Darwin: Do I?
Julius: Yes, you do.
Darwin: Yes, I do!
Julius: He's perfect. [Ends call and puts the phone in his pocket] Let's go.
Darwin Meets Julius' Friends
[Scene starts at an alleyway, with Darwin facing Julius's friends]
Darwin: Wow! You guys are so friendly! [Camera reveals the menacing pose of Julius's friends as they menacingly laugh] It’s almost like, too friendly. But, of course, there's no such thing. So, what are your names?
Reaper: I'm Reaper.
Scythe: I'm Scythe.
Mowdown: And I'm Phillip.
Scythe: [Whispering] No, dude. That's your real name.
Mowdown: And I'm Mowdown.
Darwin: Reaper, Scythe, and Mowdown. Cool nicknames. So, I guess you're from farming families, or really into agriculture or something?
[Julius, Reaper, Scythe and Mowdown laugh; Julius, behind Darwin, walks up to his friends, high-fiving Mowdown]
Julius: Told you he was perfect.
Darwin: So, do you guys have a secret handshake? I got one you can have, look. [Darwin demonstrates the handshake] Then the other guy goes... [Darwin demonstrates the handshake from the other side] That bit obviously works better if there's two butts.
Scythe: He's beyond perfect. He's the unicorn of fools. The foolicorn.
Julius: And I can make him do anything.
Darwin's First Task
Julius: Hey, [Pointing at Alison] go clean out that woman's purse.
[Camera focuses on the purse briefly. Darwin salutes to Julius. As Alison is seen sleeping, Darwin exits the alleyway, approaches the bench, and shows the purse to Julius. Julius gives a thumbs up and Darwin easily empties her purse. Julius reacts maliciously, but he and his friends become surprised as Darwin is shown cleaning the purse with a vacuum cleaner. He then puts all the contents back into the purse. As Darwin picks up a wallet, Julius shakes his head. Darwin then shrugs as Julius signals Darwin to take her money. Darwin suddenly realizes]
Darwin: [Nods] Oh!
[As Darwin takes a bill from the wallet, Julius gives a double thumbs up, but Darwin blows the dust off the bill instead, and puts it back. After that, Darwin puts an air freshener into the purse. At this point, Julius is infuriated, touching the bridge of his nose while his friends are confused. Darwin goes back to them]
Darwin: All cleaned out!
Julius: Okay, we'll try something else. [Grabs his phone and dials a number] Get a thousand dollars worth of pizza delivered at the police precinct... with extra bacon. [Passes phone to Darwin]
Darwin: Got it!
Pizza Prank
[Larry delivers a tower of pizza boxes to the police station. Julius, Darwin, Scythe, Reaper and Mowdown are hiding behind a bush to see the prank in action]
Larry: Pizza delivery!
[Doughnut Sheriff reacts in joy at the presence of the pizzas. Larry points out where Darwin and the detention kids are to Doughnut Sheriff. Doughnut Sheriff waves at them]
Julius: Wait. Why is that cop waving at us?
Darwin: Because of your generosity.
Julius: What do you mean?
Darwin: When the pizza place asked who it was from, I said you. And luckily, they already had your credit card details.
Julius: It was supposed to be cash-on delivery. How's that a prank otherwise?!
Darwin: Well, it is kind of a prank, just... not on them.
Donut Sheriff: Hey, guys, thanks for the pizzas. Although, to make sure it doesn't look like a bribe, I'm gonna have to fine you for loitering. [Gives Julius a ticket]
Darwin: [Whispering] I'm having a great time.
Cover That Van in Dirt!
[The scene transitions to Darwin and the detention kids at the parking lot of the mall]
Julius: Okay, guys, give me one more chance to prove he is an easy mark.
Darwin: [Eavesdrops] Um, my name is Darwin. Just sayin'.
Julius: [Holds the bridge of his nose] Okay. [Points to Janice] You see that nice, clean van over there? You're gonna cover it in dirt.
Darwin: [Salutes] Right away.
[Darwin runs to a mud puddle juxtaposed to Janice, then launches dirt to cover the van after inhaling deeply; however, the dirt heaps into an intricate design of animals and jungle-like patterns]
Mister Small​​​: Wow, she looks great! I was thinking Janice could do with a little facelift. Here. [Gives Darwin a five dollar bill]
Darwin: Thank you, sir! [Walks back to Julius] I guess the money should go to the boss.
Julius: Thanks.
Scythe: Whoa! Who's to say I'm not the boss?!
Mowdown: Or me?!
Reaper: Yeah, you're not the leader! You don't have what it takes!
Julius: [Throws money to the ground] Oh, yeah?! Well, take this! [Kicks Reaper]
Reaper: [Screams] Oh, didn't hurt.
[Mowdown laughs at his ridicule; in retaliation, Reaper rams Mowdown. Within impact, a high-pitched voice from Mowdown's mechanism is played]
Voice: I love you this much!
Mowdown: Ignore that! I hate you this much!
[During the dialogue, Scythe picks up the money; Mowdown aims for Reaper but accidentally punches Scythe instead. The dynamic strength of the punch makes Scythe fly, tearing the money in half; subsequently, Julius, Reaper, and Mowdown see the money in half]
Julius, Reaper and Mowdown: Why, you!
Darwin: [Overpowering] Stop!
[Scythe lands on his face]
Scythe: [Turning his head up] Why?
Darwin: Because you guys gotta get along. Or what better way, than with a song!
[Singing] With a friend, fun will never end,
You can depend from the time you spe—
[Song is abruptly interrupted]
Mowdown: Forget it! He ain't a friend of mine.
[The three other detention kids walk away from Julius]
Julius: Hey! Come back here!
Scythe: You're not the boss of us!
Mowdown: You can't even convince a little kid to do a simple bad thing!
Darwin: Aww, I had another twenty-three things that rhymed with friend.
Julius: I'll show them. I'm the master manipulator. I can make you do anything! [Walking] Come on, let's jam.
[Darwin drums the metal of the car]
Darwin: Just come in whenever you like!
[Julius grabs Darwin's hands and drags him, as he walks away]
Life All Ruined
[The scene transitions to Julius and Darwin in Elmore Junior High, near the swimming pool]
Julius: Okay, you're gonna go and leave a little surprise in the pool...
[Darwin reacts in horror]
Julius: [Pulls out "DUDZ" detergent] ...using this detergent.
Darwin: But trespassing is wrong. It's one of the seven sins— along with pride, wrath, Sleepy, Dopey, Blitzen—
Julius: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not trespassing if it's for a good cause. [Chuckles]
Darwin: Why is this a good cause?
Julius: Because every child deserves access to clean water?
Darwin: [Suspiciously] That is the most [Enthusiastically] charitable thing I've ever heard!
[On the right of the duo is a door to the swimming pool]
Darwin: Okay, how am I gonna do this?
Julius: Just use your head, kid.
Darwin: Okay. [Slams into the door with his head]
Julius: What are you doing?!
Darwin: [Pulls out his head, resulting in a protruding, elongated pair of eyes] Using my head.
Julius: [Pulling out his credit card] Here, use this!
Darwin: [Taking the credit card] Thank you. [Inserts credit card into the door slot; smiles]
Julius: Why did you do that?!
Darwin: To pay for the damage of the door.
Julius: [Angered] No, it was to open the door; it's got my name and address on it!
Darwin: Oh, cool. Then they'll be able to return it.
Julius: [Running to the swimming pool] Come here. We gotta get it back.
[Darwin also runs to follow him. Julius prepares to open the roller shutter of the swimming pool building]
Julius: On the count of three, I'll lift it up, and you drop and roll. One, two, three! [Lifts the roller shutter]
[Darwin drops and rolls outside the building instead of entering it]
Julius: No, you're supposed to go in to get—
[The roller shutter slams on his foot, causing Julius to scream]
Darwin: Give me your phone.
[Julius hands over his phone]
Darwin: [Dials] My friend has hurt his foot, and he needs medical assistance.
Julius: Who is that?
Darwin: Nine-one-one.
Julius: Are you crazy?!
Darwin: Don't worry. I'm not gonna be all like, "Oh, yeah, my friend Julius Oppenheimmer Junior, who lives on Park Road, broke his foot while trying to trespass at the public pool."
Donut Sheriff: [On phone] What?!
Darwin: I mean, this is an anonymous call! [Hangs up]
Julius: [Extremely irritated] You just gave them my name and address!
Darwin: Ah, anonymously.
Julius: And they can trace the call!
Darwin: [Throws Julius' phone onto the ground] Not anymore!
Julius: [Agitated] My phone! [Moans in anger] Just help me get my foot out.
[Both of them struggle to get his foot out of the shutter; they succeed, but in an unpleasant result]
Julius: Thanks for nothing! [Attempts to kick Darwin, but his foot causes him to scream in pain. Police alarms are heard in the background] Ah, they're coming! You gotta help me!
[Darwin helps Julius walk through the alleyway]
Julius: [Worried] Oh, no, they're gonna see us!
Darwin: Quick, let's kiss to hide our faces. It always works in spy movies! [Pushes Julius through a door]
Julius: No, no, no, no, no!
[Julius falls through the door]
Darwin: Sorry.
[Julius is shown with his body being very mangled up]
Julius: I'm fine. And given the choice, I'd take this option again.
[The scene cuts to Darwin helping Julius walk through the park toward a tree]
Julius: No, no, no— I can't— I can't walk much further. [Rests on a tree; exhales sharply] I'm gonna need some wheels. Go take someone's bike or something.
Darwin: Wait, that sounds like another bad thing!
Julius: Well, if you do this one bad thing now, we can do two good things later to make up for it.
Darwin: Do you mean like how the Romans invaded half of the world but then invented sandals and ice cream?
Julius: I don't think the Romans invented ice cream.
Darwin: Okay, just sandals then. There's two of them—
Julius: Agh, just get on with it!
Darwin: Yes, sir. [Runs off-screen]
[As Debbie rides her bicycle leisurely, Darwin jumps out of a bush in front of said bicycle]
Darwin: I commandeer this vehicle!
[Debbie screams, triggering her mistaken turns and eventual collision with the ground]
Julius: [Appearing left of Darwin] Dude, that was my girlfriend!
Darwin: [Gasps] Quick, let's kiss before she sees you!
[Darwin persists to kiss Julius, which the latter hampers by pushing him away]
Debbie: [Sees and misinterprets Darwin's struggles] Julius, a text would have been enough! [Walks away]
Julius: No, no, no, wait! Debbie! I can explain! [Breaks his leg bones and collapses. He begins crying] What have you done?! I lost my girlfriend, my crew, the police are after me, they got my address, my parents will [Covers his face] be mad at me! You've ruined me! Who would have thought my life would have been destroyed by a dumb sucker who lives in a world of kittens and rainbows?
Darwin: Julius, stop. You're not making sense. In a world of kittens and rainbows, what would the kittens eat?
[An awkward pause occurs]
Julius: Just go.
[Another awkward pause occurs]
Darwin: [Looking upset] N— Now?
Julius: Immediately.
[Darwin begins walking away, disappointed; however, he turns around]
Darwin: No! I'm gonna fix this! Wait for me at the bus stop in half an hour!
Everything Is Fixed
[Julius is seen waiting at the bus stop. As the bus enters and leaves, Darwin is revealed next to him]
Darwin: All fixed.
Julius: [Skeptical] Really? How?
Darwin: Well, first...
[A depiction of Darwin's story plays]
Darwin: [Voice-over] I spoke to your friends, and they all agreed that you had to stick together as I told the Bikers your crew declared war on them.
[A past Darwin is shown writing on a piece of paper the word "WAR" and wrapping it onto a brick. Darwin whistles to the Dolphin Man]
Dolphin Man: What?
[Darwin throws the brick at him]
Julius: Wait, what?! The Bikers?!
Darwin: Yeah, and then I patched things up with your girlfriend!
[A past Darwin "proposes" to Debbie in the mall; he opens a box revealing a ring in it]
Darwin: [Voice-over] You're getting married on Saturday.
[Everyone in the mall applauds]
Darwin: I also fixed the situation with the police.
Julius: Oh, let me guess, by making my life worse?!
Darwin: No... By making your father’s life worse!
[Darwin is seen taking a phone call on a payphone]
Darwin: [Voice-over] I told them it was Julius Oppenheimmer Senior who tried to break into the pool.
[Julius’s father is shown walking out of the store with grocery bags. There is a siren and the police are all around him]
Julius Oppenheimmer Sr.: [Drops bags and puts hands in the air] Were the coupons expired?!
Julius: What? My dad has been arrested? My mom’s gonna go nuts when she finds out!
Darwin: [Laughs] She won’t, she is being deported!
Julius: But why?!
Darwin: I changed her passport to one from Switzenburgenstan!
Julius: That’s not even a country!
Darwin: Which is why they are going to dump her in unchartered waters right about now.
[Julius' mother is shown in front of an airplane opening, while a flight attendant is juxtaposed to her]
Flight attendant: Thank you for flying with us. [Activates parachute]
[The parachute opening up causes Julius' mother to fly out of the airplane, while she screams; the flashback ends]
Julius: [Sobbing] You've made everything worse! [Notices Darwin with a "cheeky" expression] What?
Darwin: It was a joke! [Chuckles]
Julius: What? None of that happened?
Darwin: No! Now, who's easy to manipulate? And don't worry, I fixed everything with your crew and your girlfriend.
Julius: [Relieved] Oh. Eh, [Exhales] well, I guess it shows if you bully someone enough, it'll eventually backfire spectacularly, that it'll teach you a valuable life lesson.
Darwin: Which is?
Julius: I should... bully even more people to learn extra life lessons!
Darwin: What? No! The lesson is— [Notices Julius wearing the same "cheeky" expression, then wears said expression] Oh, you made a joke!
[Both laugh]
Julius: Look, man, I'm sorry. You're no sucker. You're right. The world needs more buddies, not more bullies.
Darwin: Want to [Spreads his arms] hug it out?
Julius: As long as there's no kissing.
[Both hug]
Julius: Oh, but wait, what about my parents? Are they still mad at me?
Darwin: Not after they get the cake you sent them.
Julius: What?
[Cut to Leonard Daniels delivering Julius' parents a large cake with "SORRY" written on it. Julius' parents react with joy]
Darwin: Mm-hmm. The one with "SORRY" spelled out in sparklers.
Julius: Thanks, buddy.
[Darwin and Julius perform their handshake, which concludes with them pounding their butts together; they laugh, as Darwin exits]
Julius: You did good, kid. You did goo- wait, did you say a cake with sparklers—?
[In the distance, Julius’s parents explode from the sparklers on the cake, interrupting him]
