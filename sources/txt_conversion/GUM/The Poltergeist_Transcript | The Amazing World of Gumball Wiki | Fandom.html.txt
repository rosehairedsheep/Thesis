Ghost in the Wattersons' House
[Richard is seen sleeping. Then he wakes up to the sound of thunder and gets scared]
Richard: [Waking up] Is that you, tooth fairy?
[Richard hears a moan and then screams]
Richard: Aaaaaah! It's a ghost! It's a ghost! It's a gho—
[Nicole wakes up and sighs; she turns on a music box and Richard falls asleep, calmed by the stars that come from the music box]
Breakfast
[Gumball, Darwin, and Anais are having breakfast. Gumball pours some Daisy Flakes into his bowl]
Gumball: Mom, I need more!
Nicole: But that's your fifth box.
Gumball: Well, it's because... I'm growing?
Nicole: Well, can you try to grow slower? This is costing me a fortune.
[Nicole sighs, then opens the cupboard door, revealing Richard being squeezed inside, who then hands the box to Nicole]
Nicole: Thanks. [Shocked after noticing Richard in the cupboard] Richard, what are you doing in the cupboard?
Richard: [Panicking] I'm hiding from the ghost. THIS HOUSE IS HAUNTED!
Nicole: Okaaay... I'm closing the door now. [Closes the door and hands the cereal box to Gumball]
Gumball: Thanks, Mom!
[Gumball starts pouring Daisy Flakes into his pants]
Anais: What are you doing?
Gumball: Follow me and all will be revealed.
A Surprise in the Attic
[Gumball leads Darwin and Anais to the attic]
Gumball: I've got something AMAZING to show you.
Darwin: Whoa! A sheet!
Gumball: No, Darwin. Something even better!
[Gumball pulls off the sheet to reveal Mr. Robinson under it]
Darwin and Anais: Mr. Robinson?
Gumball: Yep! I found him in the shed, so I put him up here in the attic, where I've provided him with... [Shows a dog tray with a bone] ...full-on suite dining... [Shows a glass of dirty liquid] ...unlimited beverages, and...[Shows a cardboard box with a pillow with flies flying around on it] a queen-sized bed.
Anais: Do you realize what keeping a fifty-year-old man in these conditions is called?
Darwin: Love?
Anais: Kidnapping.
[Anais walking out of the attic]
Anais: And I want nothing to do with it!
[Anais slams the attic door and leaves]
Gumball: Don't worry, Mr. Robinson. We will never abandon you!
[Gumball and Darwin hug Mr. Robinson]
Darwin: What was he doing in the shed?
Gumball: I don't know. He hasn't said a word since I found him.
Darwin: He looks kinda...
[Camera zooms onto Mr. Robinson's sad face]
Darwin: ...broken.
[Gumball and Darwin starts comforting Mr. Robinson]
Gumball: It's okay, Mr. Robinson. I know just what will cheer you up!
Cheering Up Mr. Robinson
[Scene shows sad Mr. Robinson wearing a party hat and blower]
Gumball: And now, ladies and gentleman! For tonight only, I give you...
[Gumball slides onto stage]
Gumball: Me. [Laughs]
Darwin: WHOA! [Applauds] This guy's good!
Gumball: Okay, okay. Now, what do you call.. THIS? [Changes himself into an odd figure]
[Darwin and Mr. Robinson stare at him]
Gumball: That's right! A pea on a fork! [Drum sound]
Darwin: [Stunned for a second, then gasps] His head is the pea. His head is the pea!
[Darwin laughs hysterically while smacking Mr. Robinson's back, causing him to blow his party blower]
Darwin: Funny.
Gumball: And now, what's this?
[Gumball raises his arms and starts moving his hip up and down, while the clueless Darwin stares at him]
Gumball: It's a butt — [Moves his hip up] in an elevator!
[Darwin laughs hysterically again and tries smacking Mr. Robinson's back again, but slaps his own mouth instead as Mr. Robinson is gone]
Darwin: Ow! Huh?
Missing Mrs. Robinson
[Mr. Robinson walks towards the window to realize that Mrs. Robinson is checking her mailbox. Mrs. Robinson notices Mr. Robinson, and then Mrs. Robinson angrily stomps away]
Gaylord: [Grieving] Why? Why...?
[Scene changes to the living room where Richard is beginning to enjoy his hot dog]
Gaylord: [Loudly] WHYYYYYY?!
[Richard, in shock, accidentally squeezes his hot dog sausage off to the ceiling, causing him to turn angry]
Richard: ENOUGH! [Throws hot dog bun onto the ground] You can ruin my sleep, you can terrorize my family, but you will not stop me from eating... my SAUSAGE!
[Back in the attic]
Gumball: Cheer up, Mr. Robinson! You know what I do when I'm feeling a bit low? I look at this.
[Gumball shows Mr. Robinson a picture of a funny looking cat; however, Mr. Robinson shows no sign of happiness]
Gumball: Hmm... Hey, look what I found!
[Shows the ElectroFAT machine]
Gumball: [Singing] ElectroFAT! Gets you fit while you watch TV!
Gumball: I think this might help! It says here: "Promotes health and happiness. Side-effects may include electrocution, hair loss, hair gain, depression, euphoria, black-outs, amnesia.." blah blah blah.. AH HA HA! "Get results fast!"
[Gumball and Darwin start placing pads from the machine onto Mr. Robinson]
Darwin: Well, this is exactly what you need!
Gumball: Okay, now. Power it up!
[Gumball turns on the machine while it is working on Mr. Robinson, causing him to continuously twitch]
Gumball: Look, he's moving! It's working!
[Mr. Robinson continues to twitch]
Darwin: He's asking for more! Turn it up!
[Gumball increases the power of the machine, causing Mr. Robinson to twitch even faster. The power supply starts to overcharge]
Gumball and Darwin: He's smiling, he's smiling!
[Gumball increases the power of the machine to its limit, causing Mr. Robinson to twitch vigorously, while the power supply starts to release static]
[Below the attic, Richard is setting up traps to catch the "poltergeist"]
Nicole: Richard, what are you doing? AHH!
[Nicole gets stuck on the trap while the power goes off]
Richard: [Shocked] AHH! NICOLE! NICOLE! NICOLE! WHERE ARE YOU?! NICOOOOLE!
[The power goes back on]
Nicole: I'm here. Richard, can you tell me why I'm hanging upside down?
Richard: [Panicking] Because this place is haunted, and I need to set more traps!
[Nicole sighs]
Plan B?
[Back in the attic, Gumball and Darwin cough from the smoke while scene shows that Mr. Robinson got electrocuted from the machine]
Darwin: Does he look happy?
Gumball: Nah, he looks more like a bulldog staring at the sun, don't you think?
[Gumball shows a picture of a bulldog staring up]
Darwin: Oh, yeah.
Gumball: [Sigh] Let's try to remember the last time he looked happy.
[Gumball and Darwin thinking]
Gumball: Oh, yeah! That was the day you learned how to tie your shoelaces.
[Scene flashbacks to the day Darwin learned how to tie his shoelaces, which he then accidentally tied the shoelaces from both shoes together, causing him to fall on his face while the automatic door starts closing on him]
Darwin: Oww. Oww. OWW! OWW!
[Mr. Robinson starts laughing hysterically at the demise of Darwin; flashback ends]
Darwin: Ahh... the smile on his face! I'll treasure that memory forever!
Gumball: That's it, Darwin! He finds happiness in the suffering of others! Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
[Gumball and Darwin are about to start beating themselves up in front of Mr. Robinson]
Gumball: Hey, Mr. Robinson! Look at this! [Gumball starts hitting himself by repeatedly stepping at the fork of the rake, causing the pole to hit him continuously] Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha! AH, it's funny 'cause it hurts! Ah, ha, right, Mr. Robinson?!
[Camera shows that Mr. Robinson is still not happy]
Gumball: Err...
Darwin: You gotta put more heart into it, LIKE THIS!
[Darwin hits himself in the face with a wooden baseball bat and faints. Back below the attic, Richard equips himself with a portable vacuum cleaner. Richard starts gasping for air after rolling up the stairs and then starts to prepare for attack]
Nicole: Richard, honey, can you help me down please?
Richard: [Still panicking] Don't you understand?! We're at war! [Shows Nicole his empty hot dog bun] I've already lost my sausage. [Crying] And I will not lose another one!
Nicole: But who are you fighting?
Richard: The ghost, of course!
[Back in the attic, Gumball still continues to beat himself up with a pan on his hand while crawling to Mr. Robinson]
Gumball: Hey, Mr. Robinson... Look!
[Gumball hits his face with the pan]
Gumball: Is he smiling yet...?
Darwin: Nope...
Nicole: [Offscreen] Richard. RICHARD.
Loss of Anger
[Richard and Nicole start arguing below the attic. Richard is arguing without taking a breath, whereby his face turned red]
Nicole: Richard, by all means, be hysterical, but don't forget to breathe!
[Richard then starts to take a deep breath, and then starts arguing again. This time, both of them are quarreling, while Mr. Robinson, Gumball, and Darwin looked at them. Mr. Robinson then smiles mildly]
Gaylord: Ahhh, Margaret and I used to argue like that. Sometimes up to six times a day.
[Scene starts to show a montage of Mr. Robinson's daily routine with Mrs. Robinson]
Gaylord: From first thing in the morning to last thing at night. In the kitchen, in the backyard, in the car. Occasionally, we'd do it in public. Once, even while we were sleeping. [Laughs]
[Scene changes back to the entrance to the attic]
Gumball: But what happened?
Gaylord: I don't know, something changed.
[Scene reverts back to the montage]
Gaylord: And one day, she said the spark had gone, and asked me to leave.
[Scene shows Mrs. Robinson chasing Mr. Robinson out of the house, while he sadly walks away. Scene then changes back to the entrance of the attic]
Gaylord: [Turned sad] That's when you found me in the shed.
Gumball: So THAT'S what's wrong with Mr. Robinson! He's lost his anger! Look!
[Gumball pushes Mr. Robinson's eyebrows downwards to show his angry expression]
Darwin: Oh yeah! That looks more like it!
Gumball: We're gonna sort this out!
Gaylord: How?
Gumball: Leave that to us! But first, we're gonna get you outta here!
Getting Back Your Anger
[Back down the attic, Richard holds a paper bag while breathing on it]
Nicole: Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in...
[In the attic, Gumball and Darwin try to safely help Mr. Robinson down to the backyard]
Gaylord: Are you sure about this?
Gumball: Don't worry, you're in safe hands! Ready?
[Down below the attic, Richard continues to breathe into the paper bag. After the which, Richard and Nicole see Mr. Robinson, not knowing he was under the sheet, falling down to the backyard. Both of them are shocked, and Richard screams in terror, then wielding his vacuum cleaner in anger]
Richard: ENOUGH!
[Mr. Robinson then faints at the backyard, with the sheet then covering him; scene changes to the Robinsons' backyard where Mrs. Robinson is watering her flowers, after which she cuts off one of her flowers and laughs wickedly]
Gumball: Hmm, I'm not sure what he sees in that woman. [Mrs. Robinson starts cutting off the rest of the flowers] But anyway, come on, Mr. Robinson! Let's show her you still got it!
[Darwin removes the sheet from Mr. Robinson, the group preparing to perform]
Gumball: Okay, now, go ballistic.
Gaylord: I can't, kids. I'm not that man anymore.
Gumball: Then we'll do it for you.
[Gumball and Darwin start moving Mr. Robinson's arms and mouth while shouting at Mrs. Robinson]
Gumball: [Moving Mr. Robinson's arms and mouth] Hey, you! Mr. Robinson's wife! Come and have an argument with him! I mean... me! We're gonna have a fight and you're gonna like it! [Mrs. Robinson walks up to Mr. Robinson] HA! How do ya like my arguing huh?! See how angry I am?! [Pushes down Mr. Robinson's eyebrows]
[Mrs. Robinson opens up the gate to reveal Gumball and Darwin holding up Mr. Robinson's arms, while Mr. Robinson's eyebrows go back up]
Darwin: [Still moving Mr. Robinson's mouth] Wanna make out?
[Mrs. Robinson then slams the gate and stomps away angrily]
Gaylord: [Sighs depressively] You made it worse. [Sliding down the fence gate] I didn't think it was possible, but you made it worse! [Covering himself with the sheet and starts crying]
Richard: [Mistaking Mr. Robinson for a ghost again] AAH! THE GHOST! HE'S ABOUT TO ATTACK THE CHILDREN! [Pushes the barrel of the vacuum cleaner back and forth like a shotgun and then charges forward to the "ghost"]
[Gumball and Darwin run away while Richard hits Mr. Robinson under the sheet and Mr. Robinson yelps in pain]
Richard: This is for attacking my kids! And THIS. IS. FOR. MY. SAUSAGE!
Gumball and Darwin: DAD!
[Gumball and Darwin start trying to stop Richard from hitting Mr. Robinson]
Richard: No, get out of my way—
Gumball: Stop it! Stop it! It's Mr. Robinson!
[Gumball then accidentally hits Mr. Robinson with the end of the rake, and Mr. Robinson groans in pain]
Gumball: Oh. Sorry!
[Mrs. Robinson then shows up with a suitcase full of Mr. Robinson's clothes. She throws the clothes out of the suitcase to him and then throws the suitcase at him, hurting him once more, which makes him start thinking of the moments that happened that day. After remembering the picture of the funny looking cat Gumball showed him earlier, he went into rage, causing his glasses to crack]
Angry Mr. Robinson
Richard: Show yourself, ghost of Mr. Robinson!
[Richard then removes the end of the vacuum cleaner and uses the barrel to suck the sheet off Mr. Robinson, revealing himself, also getting his nose stuck onto the barrel]
Richard: [Seeing Mr. Robinson] Hey, what's up, neighbor?
Gaylord: [Grabs barrel of vacuum cleaner] I've had enough of this family...
[Mr. Robinson plugs out the barrel off his nose and started shouting]
Gaylord: Your tacky lifestyle. Your ugly house. Your cheap darted shed! I'LL SMASH IT TO PIECES!
[Mr. Robinson starts banging the shed with his fists, while Gumball, Darwin, Richard, and Mrs. Robinson stare at him]
Gaylord: [Banging his head on the shed; gasping for air] It's more solid than I thought. BUT THIS IS WHAT I'LL DO TO YOUR UNFASHIONABLE DUCT CHAIRS!
[Mr. Robinson steps on the duct chair, only to get his leg stuck between it]
Gaylord: [Removing his leg from the duct chair] Gosh darn it! [Gasping for air] AND AS FOR YOUR CRUMMY THRIFT STORE VACUUM CLEANER! [Trying to break the barrel of the vacuum cleaner with his knees] BUY CHEAP— [Pulls both parts of the barrel apart and throws them to the ground] —BUY TWICE!
Gaylord: AND THIS!... [Snatches the scissors from Mrs. Robinson's hands. Mrs. Robinson starts to look pleased with Mr. Robinson's anger burst] ...is what I think, of your two. Dollar. Clip-on. TIE! [Cuts Richard's tie in half while Richard looks very sad]
[Mr. Robinson starts laughing diabolically]
Gaylord: I'M BACK! And as for you! [Opens the fence gate and pull Mrs. Robinson to the Wattersons' backyard, which he then starts serenading her]
Gumball and Darwin: Yay! Welcome back, Mr. Robinson!
Gaylord: Thanks.
Gumball: So, since we saved your marriage and everything, I guess that makes us best friends forever?
Darwin: So can we call you Gaylord instead of Mr. Robinson?
Gaylord: Don't push it, kid. Now, take me home, woman!
[Mr. Robinson jumps onto Mrs. Robinson's arms, and she happily carries him back into the Robinsons' house]
Richard: What was that all about?
Gumball: Well, there never was a ghost, dad.
Darwin: It was Mr. Robinson!
Gumball: We hid him in the attic!
Richard: No, I mean what's wrong with our house, our shed, and my tie? [Starts sobbing]
Gumball: [Started comforting Richard] Dad, you know what I do when I feel like a loser? I look at this.
[Gumball shows Richard a picture of a hamster lifting a barbell]
Richard: [Sniffs] Yeah. [Sniffs] I feel better now! [Laughs] Who does he think he is anyway? [Mimicking Mr. Robinson] Two-dollar clip-on tie. At least I know how to treat my wife!
[Back below the attic, Nicole is biting off the rope trap off her, causing her to fall off of it. She sighs, dusts herself off, and tries to walk off the trapped area, only to get hung upside down again by another of Richard's traps]
Nicole: AHH! [Angrily] RICHARRR—
