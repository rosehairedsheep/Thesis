You Can't Take Away Our Son!
[The episode starts out showing inside Principal Brown's office, as Richard is weeping by the desk]
Richard: How can you take Darwin away from us?!
Nigel Brown: Well it seems he scored a hundred percent in his aptitude test. This has never happened before, so I had to tell the government.
Gumball: The government?
Nigel Brown: Yes, they want to test him out. Study his brain, probe it, dissect it. That kind of thing.
[The scene switches to Darwin with an equation on a chalk board]
Clipboard Man: [Via surveillance camera] Please resolve the following equation using the marker pen provided.
[Darwin wipes marker ink all over his face]
[The scene switches back to Elmore Jr. High School]
Nigel Brown: It's best they take him away. He'd make the rest of you feel stupid.
Richard: I guess he's got a point.
Anais: So, you put clever people in quarantine like they're some sort of contagious pathological disease?
Nigel Brown: Hmmm... maybe there's more than one genius in this family.
Anais: [Gasps] What I meant was, ugh... [Pulls down her ears and blows a raspberry, then chants "la la la la", and blows another raspberry]
Nigel Brown: [Wipes his glasses] Apparently not.
Anais: Phew!
Nicole: What makes you think I'll let you take away my son?!
Nigel Brown: Well, technically, you're not his parents. He's registered as a... pet fish.
Nicole: [Worried, then sits back down] Richard, what are we going to do?
Nigel Brown: Get a new pet fish?
Richard: I'll save you, my little fish boy! [Runs into a closet]
Nigel Brown: Mr. Watterson, that is a stationary closet.
[Richard walks out of the closet and sits back down sadly]
Gumball: Can we visit him?
Nigel Brown: Nooo.
Nicole: Are you saying we'll never see Darwin again?
Nigel Brown: Yup.
Gumball: Then I'll go with him by proving I am a genius, too!
[Principal Brown, Nicole, Richard and Anais laugh mockingly at Gumball and he walks out of Principal Brown's office]
Gumball: I need to become intelligent right now! Quick, Gumball! To the liberray! The libararara! The... libarium? Eh, the place where the nerds hangs out.
[Scene changes to the school's exterior, where Richard and Nicole are crying]
Richard: [Cries] I had so much more love to give.
Nicole: [Zooms to Darwin photo] No one will ever be able to replace him.
Rocky: Hey dudes.
[Darwin's photo descends, revealing Rocky]
Richard: Oh, hi Rocky. What's with the suitcase? [Sniffs]
Rocky: Oh, I kinda got rent troubles and I don't wanna stay with parents. Hey. Can I crash at your place? Please. [Begs]
Library
[At the school library]
Gumball: Hmm... I gotta find something that will make me smart. [Turns] What do you reckon, Darwin? [Remembers Darwin is not around] Oh, right. [A tumbleweed passes by]
Felix: Oh look! Salsola collina! More commonly known as Russian thistle, wind-witch, or if you're really stupid, a tumbleweed!
[Both Eggheads laughing]
Colin: I love being smart.
Gumball: That's it! I need a bigger head!
[Gumball start to pump his head with air]
Felix: Inconceivable. Mass will always held a special place in my time table.
[Gumball arrives]
Colin and Felix: Greetings, fellow crusader of knowledge!
Felix: What's your favorite subject, hmph?
Gumball: [Unintelligible]
Felix: Calculus?
Gumball: [Unintelligible]
Colin: Trigonometry?
Gumball: [Unintelligible]
Colin: Eh? Eh? Come on, spit it out.
[Gumball bursts and splatters both Eggheads with spit, then slides away]
Colin: That guy is such a Gluteus Maximus.
The Internet
[Gumball pops up in front of a computer, with Bobert next to him]
Gumball: Hey Bobert. Whatcha' doing?
Bobert: I'm on the internet, the largest source of knowledge in the world. Why don't you get connected?
Gumball: [Uses mouse as a telephone] Uh, hi, hello. Is this the Internet?
Bobert: [Sighs] You need to click the icon.
Gumball: [Mocks Bobert by imitating him] Which one is the icon?
Bobert: Dude, it's the only thing on the screen.
Gumball: I knew that.
[Gumball clicks Internet icon and the computer shows an endless stream of pop-ups]
Gumball: Wooaaah! [Laughs] This is beautiful! I can feel it! I'm totally learning something-thing-thing-thing...
[Gumball glitches out and a blue screen of death appears, indicating Gumball has "crashed", then disappears as Gumball groggily gets to his feet]
Gumball: [Strained] What... happened?
Bobert: Your memory could not cope. You crashed. I had to reboot you.
Gumball: [Annoyed] Oh come on! There's gotta be something in this library making people smart.
[Scene changes to Teri]
Teri: This is such a great, book!
Leslie​: I'd like to borrow this, book, please?
Dictionary and Thesaurus: [Reading each other] Book book book book, book book book, ahh booook.
Gumball: Ahh that's it, they are all watching books.
Gumball's Brain
[Gumball sits between Carmen and Carrie, then he puts out a book and watching it]
Gumball: [Whispers to Carmen] Hey.
Carmen: Shh.
Gumball: [Whispers] Hey.
Carmen: Shhhh.
Gumball: [Whispers] Hey.
Carmen: Shhhhhhhh.
Gumball: I think my book is broken. I've been watching for ages and I'm still not smart.
Carmen: [Facepalms] You don't watch books. You read  them.
Gumball: Shh. People are trying to work.
[Carmen leaves the table with her book]
Gumball: Okay, brain, let's get reading. [Inhales] Once... u-pon... a.. ti-i-i-me--
Gumball's brain: That's it. I'm outta here. [Deploys a ladder out of Gumball's ear] I've had enough. I'm off to watch TV.
Gumball: Hey. Where do you think you're going?
Gumball's brain: I didn't sign up for this. I quit.
Gumball: You can't quit. There's no way I'm gonna pass a test without a brain. Please. I need you.
Gumball's brain: We'll never pass. I'm stupid.
Gumball: Then— then, I'm going to make you smart, like Darwin!
[Inside the government facility]
Clipboard Man: Uh, sir? You appear to have a bit... ink on your face?
[Darwin turns around to show his face, covered in ink]
The Watterson's House
Nicole: Are you sure there's nothing else you want, honey?
Richard: Ask for anything.
Rocky: Well, uh, can I have two cans of soda?
Nicole: Quick, Richard! The fridge!
[Richard quickly runs to the kitchen]
Rocky: Oh, and some jellybeans. But only the yellow ones!
Richard: Okay!
[Rocky questions Nicole while he wears green underwear and shoes]
Rocky: Uh, are you sure there's nothing else to wear, Mrs. Watterson?
Nicole: Please honey, You can call us "Mom" and "Dad."
Training
[Scene cuts to the School Library. Gumball's Brain can be heard crying]
Gumball: Read it!
Gumball's brain: I can't! [Crying]
Gumball: Read it!
Gumball's brain: It's too difficult! Don't make me!
Gumball: Aren't you tired of being so useless? Years and years of insults and abuse! Remember...
[Zooms in to Gumball's Brain. Visions of Miss Simian, Banana Joe and Principal Brown appear and insult Gumball's Brain]
Lucy Simian: Another "F" for you, Pea Brain!
Banana Joe: [Laughs] Doofus!
Nigel Brown: Loser!
[The three of them laugh and disappear]
Gumball's brain: Okay, I'm ready.
Gumball: Then prove it.
[Gumball's Brain opens a book and performs a chop, but ends up hurting himself]
Gumball: This may take a while.
Gumball's brain: [Falls]
[They perform a song while Gumball's Brain gets stronger]
Man: I was a feeble minded guy. I'd slip on ice and wonder why.
So many obstacles were thrown my way, on a downward slide each and every day.
But something popped inside my brain. I got up to fight that fight again.
And I knew what to do. I went through the mental pain.
You gotta think big, think deep.
Pretty soon you'll make that quantum leap.
Think big, think smart. Make your brain your finest body part!
The greatest minds from yesterday, will be crushed to dust 'cause I'm on my way.
(Big, big, big) You gotta think big!
[Gumball and his Brain freeze frame while jumping. Idaho walks by, and wonders why they are doing that, but he shrugs it off]
What the—?
[Scene cuts inside Principal Brown's office while he's enjoying his coffee, when suddenly Gumball surprises him]
Gumball: I want to take the aptitude test!
Nigel Brown: Hmmph! You don't have the brain of the genius, Watterson.
Gumball: We'll see about that. Come on, brain! Show Principal Brown what you can do.
[Gumball's Brain grabs a desk light and swings it at Principal Brown, knocking him unconscious]
Gumball: What the—? What is wrong with you?! I meant do an equation or something.
Gumball's brain: Oh. Sorry.
Back in the Watterson's House
[Scene cuts inside Watterson's house with Rocky walking around]
Anais: [Looks at Gumball's brain] I always pictured it a little smaller.
Gumball's brain: I've been working out.
[Rocky sits with Anais and Gumball]
Rocky: Hey, dudes, want some popcorn? [Shouts to the kitchen] Dad, can I borrow Mom's car tonight?
Richard: Sure, son. Anything you like.
Rocky: Man, my dad is a righteous dude.
[Gumball notices Rocky's strange attire]
Gumball: Mom? What's going on here?
Nicole: Oh. Well, this is your new brother: Rockwin.
Rocky: 'Sup?
Gumball: You're kidding, right?
Nicole: Come on. Let's just all give it a try. Just for a moment. [Humming]
[Brief pause]
Gumball: [Shouts] It's not working!
Nicole: [Sighs] You're right. It's not.
Richard: [Interrupts Nicole] Just a minute. [Hums, then stops] No, it's not working.
Gumball: [Crying] I miss Darwin so much.
[Everyone starts sighing, except Anais. Then Anais interrupts]
Anais: All right! It was me!
Gumball: What?
Anais: It was me who filled out Darwin's aptitude test. I found it on the TV guide. I should be the one taken away.
Gumball, Nicole, Richard, and Gumball's brain: So Darwin's not a genius?
Anais: No. I am.
[Suddenly the doorbell rings. They open the door and see Darwin]
Gumball, Richard, Nicole and Anais: Darwin!
Darwin: Hello!
Clipboard Men: We believe this, is yours.
[Darwin steps inside the house]
Anais: Yay!
Gumball: Welcome back, buddy!
Nicole: I missed you so much.
Anais: Don't ever go away again.
Richard: What a conveniently happy ending.
Happy Ending?
[The door starts to close, but a Clipboard Man prevents the door from closing with his leg]
Clipboard Man: Not so fast.
[Everyone gasps]
Richard: Hey. I said it was a happy ending.
Clipboard Man: You still owe us one genius.
Gumball: What do you mean?
Clipboard Man: Well, it's obvious he didn't take that test.
[Darwin gives a stupid look]
Clipboard Man: But someone in this house did, [Rips off the other Clipboard Man's paper, showing a Warrant] and this warrant says that we get to take that person away.
[Everyone gasps again]
Clipboard Man: Who is it?
[They begin to get anxious]
Gumball's brain: Ahem. I know who it is.
Gumball: [Gasps] Be quiet. Don't listen to him. He's insane in the membrane.
Gumball's brain: Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.
Gumball: No, you don't. You're stupid. We've established that.
Clipboard Man: Let the brain speak.
[A heartbeat sound can be heard as each person's worried face is shown. Then cuts to Rocky drinking soda and creating the heartbeat-like sound]
Rocky: [Burps] Sorry.
Gumball's brain: The person who took the test was... H-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h— him! [Points at Rocky]
Rocky: Huh?
[Everyone surprised]
Rocky: Me?
Gumball's brain: [Winks]
Rocky: Oh. Yeah, I took that test.
Clipboard Man: Then get your suitcase. You're coming to the research center.
Rocky: What, you mean like, for free?
Clipboard Man: Well of course.
Rocky: Eh, definitely beats my parents' place.
[Scene cuts inside the car with Rocky in it]
Rocky: Oh, and I'm gonna need a hot tub, too. 'Cause I do most of my thinking in the bath.
[The car leaves]
Gumball: See ya, Rocky.
Nicole: Bye, Rocky.
Richard: Bye.
Gumball: That was really smart, Brain. Darwin's back home.
Gumball's brain: Can I come home too?
Gumball: Are you kidding me? Get in there, little dude.
Gumball's brain: Whoo-hoo. [Enters Gumball's head]
Gumball: High five.
Gumball's brain: Ha. [High fives Gumball from his ear]
[Scene changes inside the research facility with Rocky in it]
Rocky: Oh, and a pepperoni pizza?
Clipboard Man: Then will you solve the equation?
Rocky: Yeah, yeah. After my pedicure.
