The Superest Mom
[Gumball is making a Mother's Day card in class]
Gumball: To the superest mom in the world.
Darwin: I think we need more glitter?
Gumball: Dude, this is already so shiny, she'll need sunglasses to read it.
Darwin: I don't want her to be disappointed like last year.
Gumball: What are you talking about? She loved her Mother's Day present!
[Turns to flashback, Nicole has her eyes closed]
Gumball: You can open your eyes now.
Nicole: [Opens eyes] Oh. Wow. An air freshener.
Gumball: [Scoffs] No, silly! It's perfume. Try some.
Nicole: 'Course. Uh, I'll put some on right away. [Sprays the air freshener in her face. Her eyes tear up and turn red and she starts wheezing] It's...distinctive.
[Flashback ends]
Gumball: Well, it still smelled nice, kind of like a pine forest.
Darwin: She smelled like the inside of a car for months. Every time she walked by, I couldn't help but reach out for my seatbelt.
Gumball: Well, she won't be disappointed this year! We made the best card.
[Their card is shown. On it is "Happy Mother's Day" with a muscular Nicole wearing a cape]
Tobias​: Guys, I'm sorry. But I think there's a mistake on your card. It says, "Superest mom," but I'm afraid mine is. So— [Blows raspberry]
Gumball: Dude, there can only be one superest. And the only thing your mom is super at is being super average. So— [Taunts Tobias with weird gestures, then a whistle]
Tobias​: What was that?
Gumball: I'm not sure.
Banana Joe: Your mom's aren't the superest, mine is! It's written right here.
Gumball: Dude. Just because you wrote something, doesn't mean it's true.
Darwin: What is it anyway?
Banana Joe: What do you mean, "What is it?" It's a banana!
[He shows his card. On it is "Superest mom" with a sad clown's face. No one says anything, and he puts his arm down]
Gumball: Look. I don't wanna break anyone's heart here. But at the max, your moms could be the superest in your neighborhood.
Darwin: Well, sometimes, Mrs. Mom drives down their street.
Gumball: Oh, yeah, right. Superest mom in your house then, tops.
[The bell rings. Gumball walks to the door only to be blocked and pushed away by Tobias]
Tobias​​​​​​​​: Back off, man!
Gumball: [Spins, then pulls a fighting stance] How 'bout you back off?
Tobias​​​​​​​​: [Spins, then pulls a fighting stance] You back off!
Banana Joe: [Does some swinging punches] Ohhhhhhh! You back off!
Darwin: [Sarcastically] Are you guys gonna fight, or dance?
Gumball​, Tobias​​​​​​​ and Banana Joe: Eh. Probably dance.
Darwin: Then how are we gonna settle this?
Gumball: There's only one way to settle this. [Zooms in dramatically on his face]
Banana Joe: We put our moms in a cage! Three go in! One comes out! Three go in! One comes out... [Quiets down]
Gumball: There's only one morally acceptable way to settle this. [Zooms in dramatically on his face] Let's have a mom-off!
The Mom-off Begins
[Gumball, Darwin, and Nicole are walking in the mall. Nicole has her eyes covered]
Nicole: It's so nice that we're doing something together on Mother's Day. I can't wait to see what my surprise will be. Is it a back rub? A [Opens her eyes] haircut? [Gasps] I'd love to have it done by a professional this time. The last time you guys did it, I had to wear a back brace, and a wig for a month.
Gumball: Why don't you um… look around for a couple of hours? There's a little something we need to do.
Nicole: Oh, I see-a surprise! [Giggles]
[Gumball and Darwin laugh as they walk over to Tobias and Banana Joe]
Gumball: Ha ha ha ha ha-okay. Did you bring your moms?
Tobias​​​​​​ and Banana Joe: Yeah!
Tobias​​​​​​: Did you bring your 'boo'? 'Cause you're gonna 'hoo'!
Gumball: Well, did you bring your 'f'? 'Cause you're gonna 'ail'!
Darwin: [Whispers] Gumball, that makes no sense.
Gumball: Well, what would you say?
Darwin: Did you bring your door? 'Cause you're gonna get slammed!
Gumball: [Sighs] [Whispers] Yeah, that`s way better. Anyway! Just to be clear: none of our moms know what's going on, right?
Banana Joe: My mom never knows what's going on!
Gumball: Good… anyone got any questions?
Banana Joe: [Raises hand] Ooh!
Gumball: Yes, Joe?
Banana Joe: Does the question have to be related to the game?
Gumball: Yes. Yes it does. Any other questions?
Banana Joe: [Raises hand] Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Gumball: Yes, Joe?
Banana Joe: Is pizza really a vegetable-
Gumball: Okay. No other questions? Good! Then I declare this mom-off on! First round: speed.
Round 1: Speed
[Nicole takes the escalator, smiling peacefully. Then Tobias turns a knob in the escalator control panel, and the escalator reverses. Nicole notices]
Nicole: Uh, hello? I think this thing is broken.
[Tobias turns the knob further into reverse. Nicole starts walking upwards, and falls down. She gets up, and runs]
Nicole: Hey! Stop! Help!
[She hops over other people taking the escalator, and continues running upwards]
Nicole: Somebody, DO SOMETHING! [Crashes into Pantsbully and is knocked offscreen]
[Despite this, she is able to keep up with the escalator. At the top, Gumball and the rest are watching her]
Tobias​​​​​​: Okay. You win this one.
[He returns the dial to its previous position. Nicole's speed combined with that of the escalator causes her to move so fast she flies off the end of it, and through the roof]
Tobias​​​​​​: Next up: Joe's mom in the reflex challenge.
Round 2: Reflexes
[Joe's mom, Banana Barbara, walks around in the supermarket. She stares at everything happily until she gets knocked down by a soda can]
Banana Barbara: Ugh!
[Banana Joe and the rest are hiding behind a stack of boxes, with him holding another can]
Darwin: I think you should give her a warning. This seems kind of unfair.
[Once again, Joe's mom, now bruised, walks around and stares at everything. She gets hit again]
Banana Barbara: Uh!
Banana Joe: Heads up!
Darwin: Okay. What you'd probably want to try is shouting before you throw the can.
Banana Joe: Good idea! Heads up!
[Once more, his mom is knocked down. They all walk up to her]
Darwin: Dude! You should've called from where the can is coming.
Gumball: Let's just give her a point for surviving this. Next up: Tobias' mom. Strength!
Round 3: Strength
[Tobias' mom, Jackie Wilson, is walking in the appliances section. Tobias dumps a refrigerator on her, and she catches it but struggles to lift it up. Gumball, Darwin and Banana Joe gasp. She eventually lifts it up high, making all spectators bulge out their eyes]
Tobias​​​​​​: [Laughs] That's one to me! Well, Where'd you think I got my muscles from? Go on, kiss it.
[He shows off his small muscles. Gumball sighs, and everyone leaves Tobias]
Tobias​​​​​​: Okay, I'll kiss you. [Kisses] Alright, mom, they've gone now. You can put it down.
[His mom throws the refrigerator, and spins it around. It is revealed that the refrigerator is actually just a cardboard cutout. Tobias and his mom laugh maliciously]
Tobias​​​​​​: Ahh. Cheating.
The Challenge Goes On!
[A montage of the mom-off begins while "She's The Best" plays in the background. Darwin carries cards with the numbers of the rounds on them, and announces]
Darwin: Round four: agility!
[Gumball knocks over a bottle of oil. Nicole walks over the oil, and manages to surpass the puddle of oil, albeit with struggle. Gumball winks at Tobias. Tobias' mom skates across the oil with a basket. He winks at her. Banana Joe's mom slips and shatters into pieces. Despite this, Banana Joe shows his pride for her]
[Darwin now suddenly has long, feminine legs with green heels]
Darwin: Round thirty-two: tolerance.
[Nicole waits in line. Then Gumball sneaks behind her, and puts a baby (who resembles an orange Billy) near her. The baby starts poking her]
Darwin: Round ninety-four: honesty!
[Tobias sneaks an unpaid shirt into Banana Barbara's basket. She then leaves the store, setting off the alarm]
Jackie: [Points to Banana Barbara] Security!
[Banana Barbara gets tackled by security guards as Jackie shakes her head in disapproval]
Darwin: Round one-hundred and forty-three: intelligence!
[Banana Barbara tries to get through a revolving door. Frustrated at being unable to, she walks through it while it is rapidly spinning and gets mashed]
Darwin: [Does leg strut] Round one-hundred-
[Music suddenly stops]
Gumball: Dude! What's up with the leg strutting?
Darwin: I'm just putting the "show" in the showdown. Am I wrong?
Gumball: Yeah! This is how you leg strut. [Does a leg strut of his own]
Darwin: [Imitating Gumball's leg strut] Round one-hundred and ninety-nine: resilience!
[The music restarts]
[Nicole grabs a can which turns out to be tied to a string. Pulling it, she causes both sides of the aisle to fall on her. However, her hand sticks out with the can she had taken]
Darwin: [Walks with "230" on card] Coordination!
[Jackie shops while dodging multiple objects]
Jackie​​​​​​​: [Quietly while closing eyes] Duck. Right. Duck. Step. Relax.
Darwin: [Dances with "248" on card] Compassion!
[Banana Barbara lets Betty into an elevator first, but just as she gets in, the elevator doors slice her into two and ascend]
Darwin: [Dances with "274" on card] Toughness!
[Gumball and Darwin add items to Nicole's bag as she struggles to carry it]
Darwin: [Dances with "286" on card] Endurance!
[Jackie is sprayed by many perfumes. She reveals that she is wearing mask with a mouth drawn on it]
Darwin: [Leg struts with "302" on card] Sensitivity!
[Banana Barbara plays the piano. On the first notes, the piano breaks and spontaneously catches fire]
Darwin: [Off-screen] Diplomacy!
[Nicole picks up a shirt and gets tackled by Alison and Judith]
Darwin: [Off-screen] Reading skills!
[Banana Barbara gets run over by a grocery cart]
Darwin: [Off-screen] Accountancy!
[Nicole withdraws money from an ATM, but is denied. She roars in fury as the background catches fire]
Darwin: [Off-screen] Bravery! [Continues announcing and his voice starts fading out]
The Hot Sauce Challenge
[Gumball gives a point to his mom on a scoreboard]
Gumball Okay. This is the decider.
Darwin: The hot sauce challenge! Mrs. Wilson's up first. Can she stomach a spoonful?
[Jackie walks up to Karen at a hot sauce stand, and refuses a spoon of hot sauce]
Darwin: Oh, and it's a refusal.
[Then she takes the whole bottle]
Darwin: What the-?
[Jackie downs the entire hot sauce bottle and Karen gawks ar her]
Tobias​​​​​​: And Mrs. Wilson wins! [Winks at her]
Jackie​​​​​​: [Winks back]
[Everyone notices this]
Gumball: Wait a minute. Did you just wink at your mom, Tobias?
Jackie​​​​​​: No.
Gumball: Wha-? Did you just cheat, and swap the hot sauce with ketchup?
Jackie​​​​​​: No.
Gumball: Have you guys seriously been cheating all this time?!
Jackie​​​​​​: No.
Gumball: [Faces Jackie] Do you still think it's necessary to deny it?
Jackie​​​​​​: No...
[They all walk away. Banana Barbara comes to the hot sauce stand]
Banana Barbara: Oh! Hot sauce? [Tastes] Mm. [Walks off; her back explodes]
You Won!
[Nicole is exhausted, and panting heavily from the competition. Gumball and Darwin come to her]
Gumball and Darwin: Mom! You won!
Nicole: What? What do you mean?
Gumball: We had a competition to decide who was the Superest Mom in the world, and you won! [Shows mother's day card]
Nicole: Guys, I'm no superhero.
Gumball: But you are! You've endured all the trials we've put you through and succeeded! The escalator, the oil, the shelves-everything!
Nicole: [Chuckling] Oh, I see. Come closer. Would a superhero do this? [Angrily yells] GET IN THE CAR! YOU'RE GROUNDED!
Making Things Right
[Gumball and Darwin walk to the car]
Gumball: How can we make it up to her?
Darwin: How about we just sit in the car, and do as she says for once?
Gumball: Nah, she'll be expecting that.
Darwin: I'm pretty sure she wouldn't.
Gumball: No! We need something big, something bold, something...
[Gumball sees a Mother's Day banner on a nearby car park. We then see Gumball and Darwin painting on it while on a lift]
Gumball: That should do it. [Reads painted message on banner] "You're Super, Mom. Happy Mother's Day. We're sorry."
Darwin: Dude, it says here this can only support one person.
[The lift moves]
Gumball: Eh, don't worry. I know exactly what to do.
[He starts jumping]
Darwin: What are you doing?!
Gumball: I figured that by jumping up and down, it's like I'm only half a person's weight.
Darwin: So if we both do it, [Starts jumping] it adds up to one person!
[The lift falls down to the street and both Gumball and Darwin scream as they hang on to the banner]
Gumball: How did that not work?
Darwin: Ah! We should've been jumping at the same time.
Gumball: Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
Darwin: What do we do?!
Gumball: What a real man does when he's in trouble. MOMMY! HELP! MOM! MOM!
Darwin: Dude, there's no point in screaming. Mom's at the mall, on the other side of the parking lot. She can't hear you.
Super Mom to the Rescue
Gumball: [Distant, from off-screen] MOMMY! HELP!
[Nicole is sitting at the salon, and suddenly she opens her eyes and gasps, hearing her son's cries for help.]
Nicole: Did you hear that?
Blue Elephant: Hear what?
Nicole: [Throws her sheet around her back into a cape] My kids are in danger. [One of her curlers pops out leaving a curl in her hair as she runs to rescue her boys]
Gumball: Told you we should've stayed in the car!
Darwin: Are you kidding me?! That's what I said!
Gumball: No, man. Aw, darn you past Gumball! [Smacks head] Why do I never listen?
Darwin: Well, as long as you learn from your mis--
Gumball: [Angrily yells] I WISH I WAS A BETTER LISTENER!
[Darwin sighs; Nicole, now outside, jumps over several cars on her way to the boys]
Gumball: I think if I pull myself onto that ledge, then I can backflip over that railing then vault over to that open window. I know you're not as athletic as me, so just hang on in there, buddy. I'll come back for you. [Strains himself to get to the nearest ledge but fails]
[Nicole jumps over more cars]
Billy: Mother, look! Is it not a bird? Is it not a plane?
Felicity: [Looks in wrong direction] It's a plane, honey.
Billy: No, not that. [Points to Nicole] That.
Nicole: Hang in there, boys! [Jumps off car and lands before a security barrier]
Green Security Guard: Ma'am, you can't come in here. It's vehicles only.
Nicole: [Bends the gate] Sorry, my kids are in trouble. [Runs off just as the guard gets pinned against a wall by the bent gate]
At the Parking Lot
[Gumball and Darwin panic]
Nicole: KIDS! What floor are you on?
Gumball: [Off-screen] It's about level 32!
[Nicole looks at a sign labeling her current floor as "3", making her sigh in exasperation and run up the stairs]
Darwin: Ahh, I'm sure one day we'll look back at this and laugh. [Banner rips] But not today.
[The banner tears and swings down to the car park's 16th floor, carrying Gumball and Darwin with it. But it stops as a crowd watches. Darwin then accidentally pulls Gumball's pants down, revealing his underwear, making the crowd react in disgust.]
Nicole: [Completely exhausted, having reached level 32] Kids, where are you?
Gumball: [Off-screen] Mom, we're at level 16 now!
[Nicole sighs and heads down]
Gumball and Darwin: [In unison] MOM!
Nicole: Are you guys alright?
Gumball: I'm okay! But Darwin isn't as athletic as me, he won't be able to hold on much longer!
Nicole: Hang tight!
[She grabs a fire hose and ties it to her body just as the banner completely tears, leaving Gumball and Darwin screaming as they plummet towards the street. Nicole jumps off the nearest ledge, and the fire hose swings her down towards the boys. She successfully catches them and they swing down to the pavement while Gumball keeps screaming, unaware that he has been saved]
Darwin: Dude, we're okay.
Gumball: [Stops screaming] Yeah, yeah I know.
[The crowd cheers]
Nicole: Kids, that was very dangerous. I know you were just trying to do something special for me, but-
Gumball: But you proved you're the Superest Mom in the World.
Banana Joe: [To Barbara] You're the Superest Mom. At least in my heart.
Banana Barbara: No, you're the Superest Mom.
Tobias​​​​​​: And here's your Superest Mom card.
Jackie​​​​​​: Oh, thank y-
[Tobias proceeds to angrily tear up the card before his mom can take it]
Nicole: Now, kids, you really can do something for me.
Gumball: Anything.
Nicole: Help me to the car, I think I put my back out.
[The fire hose roller Nicole is tied to detaches]
Darwin: But you're a superhero.
Gumball: Yeah, you're invincible!
Nicole: Kids, for the last time I am not a superhero. I just did what any mom would do. Now, come on. Let's go home!
[Gets hoisted upwards by the fire hose as if she were doing a superhero takeoff, just as the hose roller hits the ground]
Gumball and Darwin: Whoa...
[The hose roller crashes to the ground, episode ends]
