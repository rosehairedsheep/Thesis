Some Enchanted Evening
[Episode begins at the lookout point on a beautiful evening with a pink sunset over the ocean. Principal Brown and Miss Simian drive up to the cliff.]
Lucy Simian: Oh, Nigel, what a beautiful spot you've brought me to!
Nigel Brown: Ah, yes, sorry, this satnav's been playing up all week. [taps his satnav screen] Silly thing. We should've been at the city dump by now.
Lucy Simian: But look at the sunset. Isn't it romantic?
Nigel Brown: Oh! That reminds me, we've really gotta clean this car, it's so messy!
Lucy Simian: [leans in, whispers] It's the perfect evening to say those three little words to show how much you care about me.
Nigel Brown: Oh. Um, th-th-three little words, eh? [The car starts rolling down as Lucy leans in for a kiss.] Um, uh-h....Parking brake's off. [She fumes as they pick up speed and crash at the bottom.]
Advice from the Single Guys
[The next day, in the teachers' lounge. Mr. Corneille is reading a book while Mr. Small stares despondently at his phone.]
Mister Small​​​: Oh, man. Online dating is complicated. Women are so hard to read these days. Like, what does this mean? [Shows his phone to Mr. Corneille] "Your payment has been declined."
Moonchild Corneille: You do realize that's a pizza delivery app, right? What did you think those chili symbols meant?
Mister Small​​​: Fiery?
[Principal Brown walks in, looking dejected.]
Nigel Brown: Ugh!
Moonchild Corneille: Whoa, what's wrong?
Nigel Brown: I don't know how to express my feelings towards Lucy!
Moonchild Corneille: [suavely] Heh, feelings? You don't need feelings! You're a guy! Feelings on guys are like elbows on a fish. [whispers] They just get in the way.
Mister Small​​​: Do fish have elbows?
Nigel Brown: Look, I know how I feel. I just can't seem to find the words.
Moonchild Corneille: Huh! Words? You don't need words, you're a guy! Words from a guy are like arm bands on an octopus. You don't need them.
Nigel Brown: So what do I say?
Moonchild Corneille: You say nothing. A guy should be silent. A lone wolf, riding off into the sunset.
Nigel Brown: A wolf riding a horse? Wouldn't the wolf eat the horse?
Moonchild Corneille: Not necessarily, sometimes it's the other way round.
Mister Small​​​: So the horse is riding the wolf?
Nigel Brown: Or is the horse eating the wolf?
Lucy Simian: [off-screen] NIGEL!!! [Mr. Small and Mr. Corneille smile and nod. She storms in, carrying a box full of trash.] Nigel, where were you?! I had to clean out the car on my own! [Nigel stays silent] Nigel?
Nigel Brown: [in his head] Okay, okay, I'm a guy. I don't need feelings, I don't need words. I'm a silent horse riding a wolf with armbands. Wait a minute—none of this makes any sense! [out loud] Look, Lucy, I— [She's gone] Uh, where'd she go?
Moonchild Corneille: Ah, you weren't saying anything, so she walked out and slammed the door.
Nigel Brown: Uggghhh! Why did I just take relationship advice from a single guy who thinks fish have elbows?
[Lucy is storming down the hall, still holding her box]
Lucy Simian: First, he won't tell me how he feels, now he won't talk to me at all! Well, I'm tired of getting hurt, and I won't get hurt ag-AAAAHHH!! [Right as she approaches her classroom door, Gumball and Darwin step out. The door knocks her on the ground and sends the contents of her box flying.] PICK THAT UP AND TAKE IT TO THE TRASH!!!
Gumball: Uh, sure!
Lucy Simian: No back chat! Got it? [Gumball and Darwin exchange confused looks] ANSWER ME!!!
Darwin: Uh....
Lucy Simian: No answering back! Get on with it! [They hop to it] AND NO RUNNING IN THE CORRIDORS!!! [Walks into her classroom and slams the door. Gumball peers into the room, sees her sitting at her desk, and leaves.] If that's the way he feels, then maybe I should take some time out of this relationship! [Takes out a bag and starts putting all her belongings inside. She looks morosely at a picture of Nigel and tries to stuff it into her bag, but it won't fit, so she takes out a neck pillow to make room and leaves it on her chair. Finally, she takes her bag and leaves.]
A Dangerous Wish
[Later, Gumball and Darwin are taking out the trash behind the school. Darwin is too short to reach the bin, so he throws each piece of trash inside one by one.]
Darwin: This is so unfair!
Gumball: Yeah, I'm getting tired just watching you. I wish someone would bring her down to size!
Darwin: Yeah, and I wish she'd just soften up a little!
[A voice pipes up from inside the trash can.]
Gnome Keychain: Your wish is my command!
[The two flinch. Darwin looks inside the box and takes out a gnome keychain.]
Darwin: Oh, cute! It's a little gnome! We should take it home and build a little gnome house out of matchsticks and mushrooms, and find him a little gnome wife so they can have loads of little gnome babies, then they have to move to a bigger house, and they can't keep up with the mortgage payments, and they move to a horrible part of gnome town, and all the fancy gnomes pretend not to know him in the supermarket so they have to—[Gumball flings the gnome from Darwin's hand into the trash ]
Gumball: It's for your own good, dude.
[Darwin picks up the box and the two walk away.]
Gnome Keychain: Your wish is my command! As long as you wish for cheaper gas prices.
Breaking It to Principal Brown
[Gumball and Darwin go back into Miss Simian's room, but it's empty.]
Gumball: Miss Simian? We're done!
Darwin: Where is she?
Gumball: [Notices the neck pillow and gasps] Dude. Look what's happened!
Darwin: What?
Gumball: I think our wishes were granted! And Miss Simian's been transformed into a—
Darwin: [Points to chair] But that chair's always been there!
Gumball: No, dude. The neck pillow!
Darwin: [gasps] "I wish she'd just soften up!"
Gumball: [in horror] "Someone needs to bring her down to size!"
[Principal Brown walks in]
Nigel Brown: Lucy! I've been thinking, and I'm sorry I... [looks around] Where's Miss Simian?
Gumball: I'm sorry, Principal Brown. We made a wish on a magic gnome and now Miss Simian's been transformed into a—
Nigel Brown: Don't be ridiculous, that chair's always been there.
Gumball: No, not the chair. She's been transformed into—
Nigel Brown: [gasps] A desk! Oh, my darling Lucy! [hugs the desk] What have they done?!
Darwin: Mmmm, no, not the desk.
Nigel Brown: [runs to the window] Lucy! You're a window?
Gumball: No...
Nigel Brown: [holding the globe] A globe?
Gumball and Darwin: Mm-mm.
Nigel Brown: [holding a map] Huh?
Darwin: No.
Nigel Brown: [holding a plant] Huh?
Gumball: No.
Nigel Brown: [holding the phone] Huh?
Darwin: No.
Nigel Brown: [holding a pen] Huh?
Gumball: No.
Nigel Brown: [pointing to the fire alarm] Huh?
Darwin: No.
Nigel Brown: [holding up a used tissue] Huh?
Darwin: Eww!
Nigel Brown: [picks up various books] Huh?
Gumball: No, no...
Darwin: No. Why are we making him guess?
Gumball: [shrugs, turns to Principal Brown who is sobbing on the chair] She's been turned into a neck pillow.
Nigel Brown: Hmm?
Gumball: The one you're sitting on.
Nigel Brown: [jumps off the chair] AAHH!! Oh, Lucy, is it really you? It's the kind of thing you would think happens to other people!
Gumball: It's okay. We'll get that magic gnome out of the trash and break the spell! Don't worry!
[They look outside and gasp upon seeing the gnome being dumped into the garbage truck with the trash.]
Gnome Keychain: Your wish is my command!
Gumball: [waving his arms frantically to the driver] Hey! HEY! HEEEEYYYY!!
[Hank, who is driving the truck, notices this and smiles.]
Hank: [cheerfully to Gumball] Hey! [to himself] Hm. What a nice kid. [He keeps driving without a care until he swerves offroad, lands in a ditch, and explodes.] DARN KID!!
[Back in the classroom]
Gumball: [to Principal Brown] Okay, now you can worry.
Nigel Brown: Maybe this all happened for a reason.
Gumball: Including that truck driver going to the hospital?
Nigel Brown: Maybe not all of it. [clutches the neck pillow] All she wanted me to do was tell her how I feel! And now it's too late.
Darwin: Well, true love usually breaks the spell!
Gumball: Yeah! Just do something really romantic and she'll transform back into the hairy psycho tyrant you seem to have chosen as a life partner!
Nigel Brown: [sighs] Oh, I'm really not good at all that kind of stuff.
Darwin: We can help you practice until you are!
Gumball: Do we have to? I know we're kinda responsible, but wouldn't life be nicer if we weren't taught by someone who sounds like a jet engine dragged on a blackboard made from broken glass?
[They hear Principal Brown sobbing. He turns around with big, wet puppy dog eyes. Gumball looks at Darwin, who makes the same face, and then at the neck pillow.]
Gumball: Oh, fine! Can't believe I've been guilt-tripped by a neck pillow. I mean, who am I, Mr.--Actually, no, that's never happened to anyone before.
A One-Way Ticket Out
[Miss Simian walks up to the ticket booth at the bus station.]
Lucy Simian: A ticket out of town, please.
Milk Guy: Uh, one way? Are you sure?
Lucy Simian: [looks back and sighs] Yes. One way. Nothing left for me in this old town. I guess I gotta just-
[An injured football player steps out from the line that has formed behind her]
Football Player: Yeah, me too, lady! Nothing left for me here. Gonna pull up sticks and-
Lucy Simian: All right. 'Scuse me? I hadn't finished my thing!
Actress: So long, Elmore. This town's got nothin' but bad memories!
Twitchy Scientist: Yeah, I guess this sleepy little town isn't ready for involuntary head transplants, so I'm packing up, moving on out, and leaving!
Egg Ringmaster: [Pops out from behind the football player] Not me! I'll take a return ticket! [starts tap dancing] For I am coming back to continue my lucrative career as a tap danc--[sprains his foot] AAAHH!!! Aahh...ahhh..ah...I'll make it one way.
Those Three Words
[Gumball, Darwin, and Principal Brown are in the park. Principal Brown sits on a park bench with the neck pillow next to him.]
Gumball: Okay, Principal Brown, just tell Miss Simian what's on your mind.
Nigel Brown: Okay...Lucy, I don't know what color the dinosaurs were or how planes stay in the sky.
Gumball: Hmm. More relevant?
[Cut to later, at the Wattersons' house. The doorbell rings, and Gumball and Darwin answer to Principal Brown holding a sign that reads "LUCY, TO ME YOU ARE PERFECT"]
Gumball: "Lucy, to me you are perfect..."
Gumball and Darwin: Awww!!
[He takes away the sign, revealing another one behind it]
Gumball: [reading the sign] "...ly capable of severely injuring me with your bite and grip." [Sighs, unimpressed] Uh...fewer words?
[Cut to a plane writing a message in the sky. Gumball and Darwin, in the park, look at the message in complete confusion.]
Gumball: "I fond you". [Into a walkie-talkie] Uh, more romantic.
Nigel Brown: But they charge by the letter! And how is this thing staying up?!
[At a clothes store, Principal Brown finds a t-shirt reading "I ♥ U-" on the front. Gumball and Darwin nod in approval, until he turns it around, revealing that it reads "-nicorns" on the back. The boys facepalm.]
Gumball: No! The three words!
[The three are at a fancy restaurant, with a place for the neck pillow too.]
Nigel Brown: [To the neck pillow] Camel vibrate bucket!
Gumball: THREE ROMANTIC WORDS!!
[Cut to them on a rowboat]
Nigel Brown: Flower candle bucket!
Gumball and Darwin: NO!!
[At a storefront sale]
Nigel Brown: I LOVE YOU!!!
Darwin: YES!! Perfect!
Gumball: But why are you saying it to a horseshoe?
Nigel Brown: 'Cause I thought it would give me good luck. [To the horseshoe] Right. I can do this! Thank you, boys!
Gumball: You're welcome. Wait, where's Miss Simian?
Nigel Brown: Oh, I left her in the car, she was looking a bit tired. One of her seams was starting to burst. [Walks to the car] Lucy, I-[Realizes she's gone] AAAHHH!!! SHE'S GONE!!!
Neck Pillow Chase
[Sal Left Thumb is running away with the neck pillow]
Sal Left Thumb: Heh-heh! I could've kept the car, but there's nothing quite like a good neck pillow! Then again, I could've sold the car to buy loads of neck pillows! I could've bought thousands! Ah, my mother was right! I never think things through!
[He collides with the Doughnut Sheriff, and the neck pillow goes flying. It lands by a lamppost, where a fluffy dog walks up to it. Gumball, Darwin, and Principal Brown pull up in the car.]
Gumball: There she is!
[They run up to the pillow as the dog slowly raises his leg.]
Nigel Brown: NO! Not on my Lucy!
[The dog growls, grabs the pillow in his mouth, and runs off. The three follow the dog through the streets, where they shove past Flight Attendant, Goblin, and Larry.]
Nigel Brown: Coming through! 'Scuse me!
[They corner the dog in an alley, where he holds the pillow precariously over a storm drain.]
Darwin: How can something so adorable be so mean?! [The dog gently sets down the pillow and makes a cute face. Gumball, Darwin, and Principal Brown are won over.] Aww!! He's not all bad! [The dog takes this moment to kick the pillow down the storm drain.] Okay. He's mostly bad.
Nigel Brown: Don't worry! I know where it comes out.
[They drive up to the sewage outlet, where the pillow comes out.]
Darwin: There!
Nigel Brown: Lucy, I'm coming! [Slams on the gas]
[A bright yellow hotrod pulls up to them, with a greaser rat inside]
Rat Racer: So you wanna race, huh?
Nigel Brown: What?!
Gumball: No thanks! We're just trying to save this guy's girlfriend!
Rat Racer: Winner gets the girl!
Darwin: The girl is a cushion!
Rat Racer: I'll take what I can get! Ah-hahahahaha!! [speeds off]
[The two race anyway, with the rat repeatedly bumping Principal Brown]
Nigel Brown: What is your problem?!
Rat Racer: I struggle to connect with people! [Presses a button, causing spikes to protrude from his wheels. He puts a huge scratch in Principal Brown's car, then speeds away laughing.]
Gumball: Turn your own blades on!
Nigel Brown: I don't have blades! I'm a teacher, and this is a rental!
Darwin: LOOK OUT!!!
[There's a washing machine right in his car's path. He swerves to avoid it, and catches up with the rat.]
Rat Racer: Oh, you think you can beat me? [He realizes he's heading straight for a column] Oh, you're good! [He jumps out of the car but his car hits the column and explodes, while Principal Brown dodges it and continues on the road.]
Darwin: Is he gonna be okay?
Gumball: I don't think that guy was ever okay.
[The pillow stops at the end of the outlet. Principal Brown gets out of the car.]
Nigel Brown: Lucy! [An eagle swoops by and takes the pillow] NO! LUCY!! [The eagle flies over the interstate and drops the neck pillow on top of a moving bus]
Gumball: Oh, come on!
[The three catch up to the bus on the interstate, which happens to be the bus Miss Simian is on. She looks at her photo of Nigel with remorse.]
Lucy Simian: All I want is to tell me how you feel about me.
George: Well, I don't even know you, lady, but your demeanor makes me uneasy and your face makes me sad.
Lucy Simian: [Runs to the driver's seat and shoves her photo in his face] Not you! HIM!
[With his eyes off the road, George skids out of control, and the neck pillow falls off the bus, but is caught by the back hook.]
Nigel Brown: LUCY!!!
George: [Pushes Miss Simian's hand away] That's it, lady! I'm droppin' you off at the next stop!
Gumball: Uh, what's the plan here?
Nigel Brown: We follow it until it stops! She is the woman I love! From now on I'm gonna be more open about my feelings! I'll never let her out of my sight again!
Lucy, I Love You!
[As Principal Brown talks to Gumball and Darwin, Miss Simian's bus changes lanes, revealing an identical bus in front of it. They follow the wrong bus as it pulls up to a gas station.]
Nigel Brown: Where is she? We followed the coach all the way here! [Breaks down crying] I've lost my Lucy!!
Darwin: Look! [Lucy's bus pulls up to the gas station as well. Principal Brown runs up and clutches the neck pillow to his heart.]
Nigel Brown: Lucy! I...
Gumball and Darwin: [Nodding to him] Mmm-hmm!
Nigel Brown: Lucy, I LOVE YOU!!
[From inside the bus, Lucy hears this.]
Lucy Simian: Huh?
Nigel Brown: [sobbing] I love you! [slouches] Nothing happened.
Gumball: [sorrowfully rubs his back] Ugh. I am so sorry. It looks like we didn't break the spell.
Nigel Brown: [puts the neck pillow back on the bus] I guess you've got your own journey now! [Takes off his glasses and turns his back, sobbing]
Lucy Simian: [off-screen] Nigel?
Nigel Brown: [turns around] Lucy?
[He puts his glasses back on, and to his surprise, the real Lucy is standing in front of him]
Nigel Brown: LUCY!!
Lucy Simian: Oh, Nigel!! [They hug warmly] You love me! I'm so happy you really love me!
Nigel Brown: And I'm so happy you're not a neck pillow anymore!
Lucy Simian: Huh?
Darwin: [To Gumball, with tears in his eyes] True love did break the spell!
Gumball: Uh, did it?
[He looks over to the road, where the neck pillow is still on the bus, driving away]
Darwin: Oh. Should we tell him?
Gumball: No, Darwin. Let's not break this beautiful moment. Besides, something tells me it'll be pretty useful to have a principal who believes in a magic gnome.
[Principal Brown and Miss Simian drive away in romantic bliss with their arms around each other. She pulls him close, and they dreamily gaze at each other. As they appear to be driving into the sky, Principal Brown turns to Gumball and Darwin and waves at them joyfully.]
Darwin: We should tell them that they drove into that truck though, right?
[Cut to reveal their car on top of a car carrier with a ramp. An iris closes on them, and the episode ends.]
