The Email
[It's a beautiful morning, and Gumball and Darwin are having breakfast at the table. As Gumball rambles on affectionately about Penny, Darwin reluctantly listens as he eats]
Gumball: You see? The thing with having a girlfriend is that you have to find the balance between your space as a couple, and your space as an individual.
Darwin: Yeah, but—
Gumball: [Incoherently talking over Darwin]
Darwin: All I asked was "Can you pass me the sugar?"
Gumball: Uh, yeah, exactly! "Sugar", "Sweetie pie", "Honey buns"? We don't have stupid names like that. We're not one of those couples who, like, dress the same-
Darwin: [Over Gumball] Can we please talk about something else?
Gumball: Y-yeah dude. We talk about loads of stuff. You know, we just share stuff. You know, I mean-
Darwin: [Over Gumball] Gumball, if you don't stop talking about Penny right this second, I'm gonna start eating my own face.
Gumball: Yeah, for now I'm keeping my own place. But things keep getting serious, I guess-
[Darwin starts eating his own face]
Gumball: Yeah, I'd probably move in with her. I mean, just because we're in love, doesn't mean that we have to be obsessed with each other.
[From the bedroom, a notification from Elmore Plus can be heard. Gumball rushes to the computer, by leaping through the ceiling, emerging through the floor of his room, leaving a hole.]
Gumball: A NEW EMAIL!!! Maybe it's from Penny!
[He clicks the email, and reads it aloud.]
Gumball: [Reading] "You are now cursed. If you don't forward this email to ten people, The Snatcher will first take your money, then he will take your friends, then your family."
[Darwin emerges beside Gumball, mortified.]
Gumball: "Then tonight, he will show his face in the mirror and with his long, cold claws, he will rip your spirit away from you!" [Gasps] Delete.
Darwin: Wait! What are we gonna do if The Snatcher comes, and takes all of your money, and friends, and family, because you didn't forward his email?
Gumball: Darwin, the only way to describe how stupid this sounds is by using words that I'm too young to know the meaning of. [Deletes email]
School Bus
Gumball: So, what else do you believe in? What about Bigfoot?
Darwin: There's a photo of him. Of course he exists.
[Gumball suppresses his laughter]
Gumball: What does he eat, then?
Darwin: [Thinks] Sausages.
In the Schoolyard
[Gumball is on the ground, laughing.]
Gumball: Oh my gosh! Okay, what about horoscopes?
Darwin: What else do you think the stars are for?
Gumball: [Sarcastically] I don't know. What do you think they're for?
Darwin: To tell us about the future, and to make wishes.
In the Cafeteria
[Both Gumball and Darwin are in line at the cafeteria. Gumball is laughing again]
Gumball: Oh let me guess: you also believe in telepathy.
Darwin: Dude, how can you not believe in it when you just read my mind?
[Gumball laughs out loud]
Gumball: My gosh! You believe in things I don't believe in! [Laughs] Oh please stop, please stop! I'm afraid I'm gonna pop some--
[Gumball's torso deflates. He pulls himself up to normal, and walks to Rocky]
Rocky: Hey dudes, that's five dollars.
Gumball: Sure. [Rummages in pocket] Oh.
Darwin: Please don't tell me you lost all your money?
Gumball: No no no, it's in here. Hold on, it's…geez these are deep pockets. Aha! [He takes out his underwear] Oh. [He offers it to Rocky]
Rocky: Sorry guys. Cash, or card only.
[Cut to Gumball slicing his underwear in half on a plate]
Gumball: Here we go. Bon appétit.
[Gumball gives half of the underwear to Darwin. Darwin pushes it away]
Darwin: Dude, don't you see? It's the curse. First, The Snatcher will take all of your money!
[Gumball eats his underwear]
Gumball: Nah, come on man. The sn-- [Takes a string out of his mouth, then eats it] It's just a coincidence.
[Carrie passes by]
Gumball: Hey Carrie, can you please tell Darwin that The Snatcher doesn't exist?
[Carrie is shocked, and teleports away]
Darwin: See? Even Carrie is freaked out by the curse!
Gumball: I think it was more of the fact that we were eating underwear in public.
A Miscommunication
[In Miss Simian's class, Gumball and Penny blow eachother kisses from across the room. Gumball leans in to Darwin to pass on a message.]
Gumball: Hey dude, can you pass this on to Penny? "You're so cool that you give penguins brain-freeze".
[Reluctantly, Darwin passes the message on to a bored Leslie, sitting in front of him. Leslie passes it on to Banana Joe, Joe passes it to Carmen, and Carmen finally delivers the message to Penny.]
Carmen: Gumball says you're fat.
Everyone: [Dramatic gasp]
[Penny turns to Gumball]
Gumball: [Gives thumbs up, with a dopey face]
[Penny shape-shifts into her gorgon form and hisses at Gumball]
[The entire class starts throwing their things at Gumball. Banana Joe is thrown like a boomerang, and upon impact causes Gumball to face-plant into his desk]
I Told You So
[Gumball and Darwin walk home dejectedly]
Gumball: [Sighs] Come on, just say it.
Darwin: What?
Gumball: Well, I've lost all my money, all my friends, and my girlfriend. So, it looks like you were right to take that curse seriously. Come on, just say "I told you so".
Darwin: I don't know what you take me for, but I get no pleasure out of this.
[They walk up to the front door of their house]
Darwin: Let's just hope our family's still there.
[They open the door to find the house empty]
Gumball: Hello? Mom? Dad? [Closes door]
Darwin: Told you so.
Gumball: [Slaps Darwin] STOP, YOU'RE BEING HYSTERICAL!
[Darwin slaps him back. They slap each other repeatedly, before Gumball calls for a truce.]
Gumball: Okay, enough. This isn't very constructive.
Darwin: Right! We're doing this my way now! We're getting help…magical help.
Magical Help
[In Hector's cave, Mrs. Jötunheim is mixing ingredients into a cauldron]
Mrs. Jötunheim: Eye of a tiger… [Produces a small bottle of green liquid] …and just the tiniest drop--
Darwin: Hi--
Mrs. Jötunheim: Aah!
[In surprise, she drops the whole bottle into the cauldron. There is an explosion]
Mrs. Jötunheim: Yes, I can try to make a potion to defend you against The Snatcher's curse. But I will need assistance.
[Gumball whistles. He is shown dressed up in a wizard's robe]
Gumball: 'Sup wizards?
Mrs. Jötunheim: [Groans] Go get me these ingredients!
[Gumball takes a list of ingredients from Mrs. Jötunheim. He spins around in a failed attempt to look cool]
Gumball: Abracad-okay.
[He twirls again, this time accidentally knocking over the cauldron, spilling its contents. There is another explosion]
Mrs. Jötunheim: [Coughs] Without twirling this time!
[Gumball walks away sheepishly]
Darwin: Mrs. Jötunheim, who is this Snatcher guy?
Mrs. Jötunheim: There once was a young man, a mortal man, who fell in love with a beautiful ghost after seeing her in a mirror.
[As she continues, some images from the story are formed in her cauldron]
Mrs. Jötunheim: All he wanted was to kiss her just once. In a forbidden book, he found an incantation. It allowed the living to touch a ghost. The price for this: a cursed life. Now, his spirit floats in limbo, trapped behind mirrors. Everyday day becoming more lonely, more angry, looking for someone to take his place.
[A skeleton arm appears. Darwin and Mrs. Jötunheim scream. Gumball is revealed to be holding the arm]
Gumball: What? That's what you asked me for.
[Mrs. Jötunheim takes the arm, and drops it into the cauldron]
Mrs. Jötunheim: Stay back!
[A large plume of green smoke with an evil face on it emerges from the cauldron. As the smoke grows, Gumball and Darwin cower and brace themselves. Mrs. Jötunheim comes back with a fire extinguisher and puts out the smoke]
Mrs. Jötunheim: What are you looking at, you dumb trolls?! Couldn't you see it was on fire? When The Snatcher comes for you through the mirror, throw this at him.
[She reaches into the cauldron, and takes out a "#1 Mom" mug with green liquid in it. It is smoking, and its rim is covered with green grime]
Gumball: Uh…
Mrs. Jötunheim: Sorry, I haven't done the dishes.
At Home
[Gumball and Darwin enter their home, Gumball holding the mug. As they slowly enter, the door slams shut. Gumball gasps]
Gumball: He's here. I can feel it.
[The doorknob suddenly starts jiggling. The boys watch in suspense. Suddenly, Richard, Nicole, and Anais barge in gleefully]
Richard, Nicole, and Anais: Fried chicken day!
[Panicked, Gumball throws the liquid in the mug at Richard. Richard starts screaming in pain. Suddenly, he calms down, and tastes the liquid]
Richard: Actually, it's not that bad. What's in it?
Gumball: You don't wanna know.
Darwin: Well what are we gonna do now when The Snatcher comes?
Gumball: It doesn't matter, they're here! All this snatcher stuff was baloney. Oh man, I thought you guys were gone forever.
Anais: It sure felt like it.
Nicole: [Sighs] Your father was banned from the chicken shack, so we had to go out of town to get some.
Richard: Well, they shouldn't say "All you can eat" if they don't mean it.
Nicole: Richard, you ate a chair.
[They walk to the table. Gumball stares smugly at Darwin]
Darwin: [Sigh] Go on, say it.
Gumball: Say what?
Darwin: "I told you so".
Gumball: I'm gonna do another dance first.
[Gumball dances around Darwin]
Darwin: I'm glad you're taking this seriously.
The Snatcher
Nicole: Could you pass me a wing please?
Richard: Sure.
Darwin: Hey guys, leave some for us.
[Suddenly, there is a green eerie light. The Snatcher's hands emerge from the glass around and snatch Nicole, Anais, and Richard. He drags them into the glass (Richard into a window; Nicole and Anais into separate pictures). Before being taken completely by The Snatcher, Richard struggles to eat some more before being completely taken away. Gumball and Darwin watch in shock. Then The Snatcher himself reappears in a picture, and growls at them before disappearing again. After a moment of silence, Carrie teleports to them with the Forbidden Book. Gumball and Darwin scream in surprise]
Carrie: Calm down! Calm down! When I saw you this morning, I recognized The Snatcher's curse. So I went to the underworld to retrieve the Forbidden Book. It has the solution. The only problem is that we have to wait until the sun rises.
Gumball: Wait. How come you know so much about all this?
Carrie: There once was a young man, a mortal man who fell in love with a beautiful—
Gumball: Yeah, yeah thanks. We know.
Carrie: Did you know that the young man and the ghost had a child?
Darwin: Ew, a zom-baby.
Carrie: Uh...that child was me.
[Gumball and Darwin suck in their breath]
Gumball: Alright, what do we do?
Carrie: We survive.
Gumball: [Walks to the door] I've got a much better idea: how 'bout we bail?
[The house starts shaking. The Snatcher's face emerges from the door. Gumball turns to his side to see The Snatcher. At once, The Snatcher disappears. Gumball turns away, and The Snatcher emerges again. After turning to his side, he disappears. Gumball turns away again, then quickly turns to his side]
Gumball: Aha!
[The Snatcher's face emerges and scares Gumball. As he catches his breath, The Snatcher comes out of a nearby picture, and tries to snatch him]
Gumball: Ah! So let me get this straight: that poltergeist creep is your dad?
Carrie: Yes, and I would appreciate it if you stopped calling him names, and treat him with the respect he deserves.
[Darwin walks to The Snatcher, and holds a fin out as if to shake hands]
Darwin: Glad to finally meet you, sir.
[Gumball pulls him away just as The Snatcher pounces]
Darwin: He seems to have a few issues.
Carrie: It's not his fault. He's been turned evil by loneliness.
[Gumball is knocked down on a table. The Snatcher emerges from the TV. Darwin quickly takes the remote, and switches the TV on. This makes The Snatcher disappear, but the TV shows the shopping channel]
Man (on TV): ...Ten dollars. Ten dollars, today only...
Gumball: Dude, I think I'd prefer a life of damnation in limbo rather than having to watch that.
Darwin: Yeah, fair enough.
[Darwin switches off the TV, and The Snatcher reemerges. They all take cover behind the sofa]
Gumball: What are we gonna do about him?
Carrie: The book says we summon him by calling his name five times. When he appears in the mirror and the first light of dawn strikes it, you smash him with the book and break the spell.
Darwin: Why do we have to call his name five times?
Carrie: Duh. That's how you summon all ghosts.
Darwin: Really? Carrie Carrie Carrie Carrie Carrie!
[Carrie reappears at Darwin's side. Gumball and Darwin laugh]
Gumball: Carrie Carrie Carrie Carrie Carrie!
[Carrie reappears at Gumball's side. Gumball and Darwin laugh again. Then Carrie possesses Gumball, and makes him slap himself. She comes out shortly]
Carrie: We done here?
[Gumball nods]
Darwin: Why don't we just use the book to defend ourselves?
Gumball: Great idea!
[The Snatcher hops from one mirror-like surface to another. He appears near the three of them. Gumball takes the book, and strikes The Snatcher with it. They run into the kitchen]
Darwin: No, I mean use the spells inside.
Carrie: Don't! The price to pay is too high!
Gumball: Oh, we don't have a choice! There, a time traveling spell. Let's just go to through the night. Tempus Fugit!
[The night fast-forwards to dawn]
Gumball: Ha ha! In your fa- [Grows old] aaace...
[Gumball walks to the microwave, and looks at himself in its reflection]
Gumball: [Old man voice] Ah! What happened?
[Carrie pulls him away just as The Snatcher emerges from the microwave]
Carrie: The price for that spell was your youth.
Darwin: Don't worry, there must be something to fix that. There! Beautio Eterno!
[Gumball's wrinkles fade away somewhat. His face is pulled up, giving him a disfigured smile]
Gumball: How do I look?
Carrie: Eternally surprised.
Gumball: Look out!
[The Snatcher's arm emerges from the microwave again. Before it can grab Darwin, he shatters to pieces]
Gumball: What happened?
Carrie: The price for eternal beauty is his life!
Gumball: What? Hold on. Resurectio Fortis!
[Darwin reassembles, now with his body parts stitched together, like Frankenstein's monster. The Snatcher is touched by the light of dawn, and flees back into the darkness]
Carrie: Come on, the sun's about to come up!
Gumball: Wait, there's a big mirror in the attic! [His body shrivels away, leaving only his head]
Carrie: Oh no! The price for resurrecting Darwin was your own body--
Gumball: Yeah, yeah, I figured that one out.
[Darwin carries Gumball's head and they go up to the attic and approach the mirror]
Carrie: Quick, call his name five times.
Gumball: Okay. Uh…what's his name again?
Carrie: Vladus Lovus Lokowitchki.
Gumball: Vladus Lo-- [Gets literally tongue-tied] I think I sprained my tongue.
Carrie: Just say Vlad.
Gumball: Vlad Vlad Vlad Vlad Vlad!
[The Snatcher emerges from the mirror. The three back into the window in the attic, opening it and exposing The Snatcher to the sunlight. He writhes in the light, and retreats into the mirror. Carrie throws the book at him and breaks the glass. This frees Anais, Nicole, and Richard (who all emerge from mirrors and mirror-like surfaces). A portal opens up in the broken attic mirror. Someone emerges from it]
Carrie: Dad? It's me. Do you recognize me?
Vladus: How could I not recognize my beautiful girl? Thank you for setting me free.
[They run to hug each other. But the moment is ruined when Carrie phases through her dad, and he falls out of the window. This kills him]
Carrie: Dad! Is he okay?
Gumball: [Inhales sharply] No no no no no no no no. Uh… no no no no.
[Just as they are about to walk away, Carrie's father phases through the floor, revealing that he has turned into a ghost himself. He and her daughter share a hug. The rest of the Wattersons arrive at the scene]
Richard, Nicole and Anais: Awwww!
Gumball: You see, this is like me and Penny because we--
Richard, Nicole, Darwin and Anais: Ugh!
