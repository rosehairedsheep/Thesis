The Doldrums of January
[Mr. Small walks by the Wattersons' house, depressed]
Narrator: 'Twas the middle of January in old Elmore Town, and everyone was feeling quite down.
[Mr. Small lies down on the sidewalk. A sad bird falls into the chimney]
Narrator: The year's first month is depressing and grim, with Christmas all over and light growing dim. With naught to celebrate no holiday cheer, you'll find no joy at this time of year.
[Richard goes out to take out the trash, but throws himself in the bin instead]
Narrator: Except for one little boy, whose color is blue.
[The scene cuts to the house's table, where Gumball gapes with despair]
Narrator: No. Wait a minute. He was down, too.
Anais: What's up?
Gumball: [Still gaping] Ugh! I hate January! I'm so depressed, I can't even bother to move my mouth when I talk.
Anais: I know. Even the word sounds depressing. Januareeeeeeh. Eh.
Gumball: [Sighs] How long till next Christmas?
Anais: Three-hundred and forty-nine days. That's two-hundred and twenty-seven days of school, three-hundred math classes, and seven-thousand time checks waiting for the day to end.
Gumball: [Growls and rips face off in anger, then grows a new one] We need a new holiday!
Anais: Like a made-up celebration? Like Grandparents Day or Valentine's Day?
Gumball: Exactly! We invent our own holiday, and everybody will be happy!
Narrator: The little boy smiled, and the sadness diminished. But I'd be out of a job if this story were finished.
Anais: So what should we call it?
Gumball: How about "Fun day"?
Anais: Gumball, nothing that calls itself "fun" ever is: fun-sized, fun run, fungus.
Gumball: What about Dependence Day?
Anais: [Acts silly] Yay! Where we all celebrate our lack of freedom.
Gumball: What about Wig Tide?
Anais: "Wig Tide?" That's not a bad name.
Gumball: Really?
Anais: Yeah, for a bald surfer!
Gumball: Danke Party, Schnitzel Time, Googoo Bash, Sluzzle Tag!
[Darwin walks in, animated in black and white like an old 1930's rubber hose cartoon]
Darwin: What's "Sluzzle Tag?"
Gumball: Only the best day of the year!
Anais: What's going on with you, anyway?
Darwin: I haven't seen the sun for so long, I've lost all my color. I'm so depressed!
Gumball: Then why are you dancing?
Darwin: I think I've got the shakes.
Gumball: Don't be depressed to behave like a drag, for everyone knows today's Sluzzle Tag!
Narrator: Uh, I'm the one here who does all the rhymes, so wait for your own… times. And so was born the Sluzzle Tag lie. Now all the boy needed was the town to comply.
On the Way to School
[On the school bus, Gumball explains Sluzzle Tag]
Darwin: So, what happens on Sluzzle Tag?
Gumball: Well, everyone gets presents,
Darwin: [Gasps excitedly]
Gumball: And there's a feast, and we all share the spirit of, uh, Sluzzle Dude.
Darwin: Sluzzle Dude? What does he look like?
Gumball: Uh, he's got a beard, sneakers, and a leather coat.
Darwin: Is that all he's wearing? It sounds like he should be running from the police.
Gumball: No, man, he's really cool. That's why they call him "dude." He brings us all presents.
Darwin: [Gasps excitedly] In a sleigh?!
Gumball: Well, there's no snow, so he drives his... magic van.
Darwin: With reindeer?!
Gumball: Pssh! No. He's too cool for that. He's got some, uh... [Hears dogs barking in the distance] Dobermans!
Darwin: What are their names?
Gumball: Uh, Trasher, Smasher, Rancid, Rage Slayer, and Rabies.
Darwin: Are you sure Sluzzle Dude is a nice guy? Because he sounds pretty metal.
Gumball: Yeah, but you know metalheads, they pretend to be hardcore, but they're just hippies who like leather.
Darwin: Cool! So do we get a day off school?
Gumball: Of course.
[Everyone gathers around Gumball]
Rocky: Tell us more. How does he get into houses?
Gumball: Through the toilet.
Darwin: Ew! Why?!
Gumball: Oh, come on, dude. He doesn't want to get covered in soot.
Rocky: And what kind of music do you play on Sluzzle Tag?
Gumball: Grindcore.
Banana Joe: What's grindcore?
Rocky: Grindcore goes a bit like this. [Gruff voice] Raah! Raah rah-rah raah! Rah-rah-rah-rah-rah-rah! It's important not to mix it up with black metal, which is more like... Raaaaaaah! Another common mistake is to confuse it with Viking metal, which sounds more like banging a trash can with an axe.
Banana Joe: Thanks, Rocky, uh, but aren't you supposed to be driving the bus?
Rocky: Yeah, but I'd rather talk about Sluzzle Tag.
[The kids scream while the bus drives itself directly into a right turn. Miss Simian is seen sipping coffee in her classroom, until the bus crashes into the room and surprises her. The students come out]
Sarah: Happy Sluzzle Tag, Miss Simian!
Lucy Simian: What does that mean?
Darwin: It means we get the day off school, and we get presents from Sluzzle Dude!
Lucy Simian: That sounds like complete megaloney.
Gumball: What's that?
Lucy Simian: It's baloney times a thousand.
Mister Small​ [Off-screen] No, it's true!
[He reveals himself, with his face taped into a smile]
All: UGH!
Lucy Simian: What's with the tape?
Mister Small​: It's been so depressing I forgot how to smile and so did my facial muscles, so I improvised. But since it's Sluzzle Tag, I don't need this anymore.
[He takes off the tape, which also pulls of some of his fluff (revealing his real face underneath)]
Lucy Simian: Oh, get a grip! Sluzzle Tag is a lie! Isn't it obvious?
Nigel Brown: [Muffled] No! It's a legitimate holiday!
[Miss Simian opens a drawer, and sees Principal Brown inside it. He gets up vampire style]
Nigel Brown: Mazelbrag originated from some country where they do things.
Gumball: It's Sluzzle Tag.
Nigel Brown: I was using the original, um... P-P-Prussian dialect.
Lucy Simian: What are you doing in there?
Nigel Brown: I was so sad, I tried to hibernate till spring, but it turns out that whatever I am doesn't do that. Anyway, everyone gets a day off. Jolly Sluzzle Tag! Bye! [Zips off]
[Everyone leaves Miss Simian merrily]
Lucy Simian: Wait. Get back here! This is a school day! Hmm. I will prove to you there is nothing to be happy about in January. [Makes an evil smile]
Narrator: 'Twas then that Miss Simian knew just what to do. She'd make people see Sluzzle Tag was untrue.
Shopping
[Gumball, Darwin and Richard pass by some Sluzzle Tag carolers, and enter the mall]
Gumball: Dad, where did you get that sweater?
Richard: From the Sluzzle market.
Gumball: There's already a Sluzzle market?
Richard: Where do you think I bought the toilet decorations? [Gruff voice] LA LA LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA! Haha.
Darwin: So, what do we eat for the Sluzzle feast?
Gumball: O-oh, yeah, um… [Glances at a shelf] Roasted bleach fertilizer with a shampoo garnish [Quietly] Wrong side of the aisle. [Walks to other side] Ask me again.
Darwin: What do we eat for the Sluzzle feast?
Gumball: [Glances at shelf] Baby dog paste. Ha! Just kidding. Classic Sluzzle Tag joke. We eat junk food --the worst you can think of.
Richard: The worst I can think of?!
[He starts summoning up food]
Richard: By the power of cheese! [Cheese materializes in one hand] By the power of bacon! [Bacon materializes in other hand] By the power of processed meats! [Processed meats appear in a circle above him] By the power of carbs and deep-fat frying! [Brings meats together] I give you… The Sluzzle-wurst! [He finishes his summoning sequence] It's a sausage with everything in, and on it.
Darwin: Ugh! Each slice of that thing has enough calories to get us to next Sluzzle Tag.
Richard: "Slice"?! [Strokes Sluzzlewurst] Don't you dare carve up a masterpiece. I'm gonna make five.
[Scene changes to the counter]
Larry: Please swipe your card, sir.
Richard: [Swipes card] Huh? [Tries to pull out card] What the?!
[His card is sucked of all its value and color]
Richard: Something's sucking my card dry!
Gumball: Wait. How much was this?
Larry: Seven-hundred and seventy-five dollars.
Richard: What?! For five Sluzzle-wursts? [Pulls out card] You vampires!
Larry: I'm sorry, sir. Sluzzle Tag prices.
Richard: But what about the milk of Sluzzle Tag kindness?
Larry: That'll be in the dairy aisle at a hundred and eighty-nine ninety nine a bottle.
Richard: Fine! We'll take two.
[Gumball, Darwin and Richard pass by the same Sluzzle Tag carolers, as they exit the mall. Richard grabs their cup, and eats its contents]
Richard: Thank you. [Walks away]
[Miss Simian is seen hiding near the carolers]
Celebrating Sluzzle Tag
[Many citizens are shown waiting at their decorated bathrooms in excitement]
Narrator: The townsfolk rejoiced as nighttime fell. The Sluzzle Tag spirit had them under its spell.
[Gumball decorates the toilet of his family's bathroom with an electric guitar]
Darwin: Wait. What if Sluzzle Dude is hungry?
Nicole: We can leave him some milk and cookies.
Darwin: Good idea. [Dumps milk and cookies in the toilet, then flushes them]
Gumball: Well, that cuts out the middle man.
All: [Laugh]
[Miss Simian watches them through a window on a ladder]
Lucy Simian: [Whispering] I'm watching you.
[She gestures to them. Her fingers bump into the closed window, and she ends up falling down. Cuts to the Wattersons eating Sluzzlewursts for dinner]
Anais: Dad, this Sluzzle-wurst is so fatty, I'm sweating butter.
Richard: [Licks Anais] Ooh! Butter!
All: [Hug Anais] Ahhh.
[Anais slips from them, and launches into the ceiling and back down]
All: [Laugh]
[In the living room…]
Gumball: Let's watch the Sluzzle Tag special. [Switches on TV]
Skeleton kid (on TV): Jolly Sluzzle Ta—
[The TV screen abruptly cuts to a lost signal image with a sad X-eyed face]
TV: Unfortunately, animation is a lengthy process, and that's all we've had time to make. Jolly Sluzzle Tag.
All: [Laugh]
Nicole: Oh well. I think it's time for bed, guys.
[In the bedroom, Nicole and Richard (dressed in rock outfits) greet Gumball, Anais and Darwin, who already in bed]
Richard and Nicole: [Quietly] Happy Sluzzle Tag. [Closes door]
Darwin: I can't wait to see what Sluzzle Dude brings me.
Gumball: [Quietly] Me too.
Darwin: Jolly Sluzzle Tag.
Gumball: Good night, buddy.
Saving Sluzzle Tag
[Gumball closes his eyes only to be interrupted by Anais]
Anais: [Whispering] So, what are you gonna do now?
Narrator: As all in the land lay happy in slumber, the little boy realized his Sluzzle Tag blunder.
Gumball: What do you mean?
Anais: Sluzzle Dude is supposed to give presents to everyone in Elmore.
Gumball: Yeah.
Anais: And you made him up.
Gumball: Yeah.
Anais: So who's gonna bring all of the presents?
Gumball: Well, Sluzzle Dude will, of course. D'oh. I see what you mean now.
Narrator: Well, he realized eventually.
[In the living room, Gumball panics]
Gumball: Oh my gosh! WHAT HAVE I DONE?! Think about how upset everyone's gonna be when everything I promised doesn't come true! It'll be like...
[Imagines Earth blowing up]
Anais: I think you're being overdramatic. It'll be more like...
[Imagines a clay model version of Gumball being smashed up]
Gumball: Anais, you have to help me, 'cause Elmore is waiting for a wish to come true [Singing] for presents delivered by their Sluzzle Dude. You cannot deny them their hopes and beliefs! To lift them from sorrow, to save them from grief, to bring such— [Sings in a higher octave]
Anais: Okay! I'll help you! Just stop singing!
Gumball: [High octave] Oh, thank gosh. I don't think I could've gone any higher.
Lucy Simian: [Peeking through the door's letter slit] Yeah, I've got you now, Watterson.
[She attempts to take a picture only to be slammed in the face by the door. Gumball runs out]
Anais: Gumball, you just broke the door! It's supposed to open inwards, you know.
[Miss Simian collapses from being stuck on the door]
Narrator: To save Sluzzle Tag, they ran and they ran. Only one thing was missing and that was a plan.
[Frozen in the middle of running, Anais and Gumball fall on their faces. Gumball gets up, and runs again]
Anais: No, wait! Stop running! We need a plan!
Gumball: [Walks back] Oh, sorry.
Anais: Actually, no. Carry on. Running helps you think.
Gumball: [Runs in place]
Anais: Okay. First, we're gonna need presents. Luckily, trash cans are full of all the lame Christmas gifts people pretended to like, like that treadmill mom bought for dad. Just grab that.
[Gumball runs while carrying the treadmill with Anais running on it]
Gumball: Something about this doesn't feel right.
[Scene skips to Banana Joe brushing his teeth. The toilet suddenly opens up, and a treadmill bursts through it, sending it flying through the ceiling]
Banana Joe: Wow! I guess. Thanks for the treadmill, Sluzzle Dude!
[The toilet falls on the operational treadmill, and squishes Banana Joe. Then other citizens get their presents]
Narrator: So, the blue boy turned his wrongs into right, leaving everyone garbage on Sluzzle Tag night. The plan was successful and nothing could spoil it,
[In Tony's bathroom, Gumball quickly goes back into the toilet as the mentioned person uses it]
Narrator: Until that guy there went and flushed his own toilet. So they snuck into homes but with joy in their heart, so we'll try to ignore the not-so legal part.
[Gumball and Anais are shown breaking into other people's houses. In one, Gumball prepares to cut down a door with an axe]
Anais: Gumball, this is our home.
Gumball: Then the door's already broken.
Anais: Oh, yeah.
Gumball: Hyah! [Slices door]
[In their bathroom, Darwin is seen sleeping. They then sneak a present beside the toilet. Then Miss Simian takes a snapshot of them sneaking the present. Darwin wakes up]
Narrator: But just when they thought it was all in the bag, an evil force came to spoil Sluzzle Tag.
Lucy Simian: [Laughs and enters through window] Ha! Sluzzl— Aah! [Slips on bathtub, but gets up] Sluzzle Tag is nothing but a lie! Now I can prove it! [Shows photo to Darwin] See?!
Darwin: Who's that?
[Miss Simian sees that the photo she is showing is a photo of her butt]
Lucy Simian: Never mind.
Narrator: It was an attempt, although unrefined, to see what her backside looked like from behind.
Lucy Simian: [Shows correct photo] See?!
Darwin: … [Inhales deeply]
[Gumball and Anais cover their ears]
Narrator: We'll save you the pain of how loud Darwin's sound was. Just imagine the scream of a million Chihuahuas.
Richard and Nicole: What was that?!
Nicole: Sounds like someone put their tail in the deep-fat fryer.
Banana Bob​​​​​​​​: [Pops up from window] Or they stepped on the toes of the world's worst choir.
Jackie​​​​​​: [Pops up beside] Or a pack of hyenas in a fight with a rat.
Narrator: Yeah, whatever. Something like that.
The Truth
[Citizens gather up in the bathroom]
Gumball: Uh, I'm sorry. Sluzzle Dude doesn't really exist. Made him up. I made the whole holiday up.
All: [Inhale deeply]
Narrator: Though you may think his crime unforgivable, the young boy was blessed by a Sluzzle Tag miracle.
[Everyone (except for Miss Simian) sighs in relief]
Banana Bob​​​​​: To be honest, I kind of knew it was a lie all along.
Nicole: It was kind of weird when I saw a snowman wearing studded leather pants.
Darwin: Yeah, I knew, too. I just really needed something to get me through January. [Grabs a present] I think we all do. [Hands the present to Miss Simian] Even you, Miss Simian.
Lucy Simian: Ah! [She opens the present: it's a fish paperweight] Ah! A hideous gadget that I'll never use.
Richard: Who would ever throw that away?
Lucy Simian: I did. Sorry, Nigel.
Nigel Brown: Oh, it's alright. I hated yours, too.
All: [Laugh]
Narrator: The end of our story is now drawing nigh, and the Sluzzle Tag moral is not hard to spy, that when life is tough and joy hard to come by, most people are happier believing a lie.
[Fades into black, and then the episode ends]
