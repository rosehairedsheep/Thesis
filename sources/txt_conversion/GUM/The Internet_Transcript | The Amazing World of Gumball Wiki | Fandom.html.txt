Gumball's Video
[It is a nice sunny day outside, with kids playing and animals foraging around. But Gumball and Darwin are cooped up inside their bedroom. They're looking at videos on the Internet. The sound of wheels rolling and crunching can be heard on the unseen video. They cringe, with their eyes shut]
Gumball and Darwin: Ooh!
Gumball: Dude, his foot is pointed in the wrong direction!
Darwin: He's going to be walking in circles for the rest of his life! Pick something else! Pick something else!!
[Gumball clicks another video with his eyes still shut. A dog barks on that unseen video. He and Darwin open their eyes]
Gumball and Darwin: Aw!
Gumball: Gosh, this is so cute, it should be illegal. [Darwin is heard gasping] What's up with you?
[Darwin has gotten very fat]
Darwin: Dude, please click something else. These puppies are so sweet, they're making me fat! [falls over out of sight]
[Gumball clicks another video, and Darwin immediately gets up, having reverted to his original shape. Eerie music is heard]
Gumball: Huh? [looks closer at the screen, from the computer's POV] There's no ghost in this video. [looks even closer] It's just a car driving down the r--
[A scream is heard, and Gumball freaks out for a prolonged time, making a series of funny faces. Eventually he stops, silent for a moment]
Gumball: Pbht! Wasn't scary at all. Let's watch some more people making fools of themselves.
[He clicks a video, and a familiar voice is heard. Cut to the computer monitor, and on the screen is a video of Gumball freaking out just seconds ago]
Gumball: What the what?! [begins desperately typing on the keyboard] How did that happen?! What's going on here?! Stop it!
[The video becomes viral as it pops up in a bunch of windows on screen]
Darwin: [laughs] It's your fat fingers, dude. You started the webcam and uploaded yourself by mistake.
[Gumball sticks his finger in Darwin's mouth]
Gumball: Stop laughing, and do something!
[Darwin clicks the keyboard with his foot Gumball removes his finger and wipes it on Darwin's cheek. He then buries his face in his palms]
Gumball: I'm doomed! [sobs] I broke the number-one rule of the Internet -- don't put yourself on the Internet!
[He breaks down crying. Darwin consoles]
Darwin: Come on, man. Do you know how many videos there are on the Internet? You're just a drop of embarrassment in an ocean of shame. I'm sure no one's seen it yet.
[Darwin clicks, and the boys are astonished to see the number of views on Gumball's video rapidly multiplying so much that the digits are piling up on the side of the screen and then bursting out the side of the monitor]
Gumball: No! Man, how is that even possible?! That's more views than there are people on Earth! [sobs]
Darwin: Well, on the plus side, it can't get any worse. Anyway, it's the Internet, dude. It'll die out as fast as it started.
Gumball: Delete it! Do something!
Darwin: I can't. You can't delete anything on the web.
Gumball: Do something! Do something now! Do something!!
[Darwin turns the monitor in the opposite direction, away from Gumball's view]
Gumball: Oh, yeah. That's better.
Darwin: I... think that's enough internet for today.
At the Library
Gumball: I'm really enjoying this time off from the internet. I can finally develop my brain, and study the big classics of literature!
Darwin: [Sees what Gumball is reading] "The Little Platypus Who Took the Wrong Bus"?
Gumball: Oh man, it's intense! It's this platypus baby on his quest for family and identity. Is he a duck? Is he a beaver? An otter? And more to the point, where's his mother? [Slams table] A platypus child needs his mother, dude! [Sobs]
Darwin: Well, I'm glad that's taken your mind off that video.
Gumball: Oh, yeah. No one's even mentioned it. Now that I think about it, where is everyone?
[Laughing is heard. They go to the source, and gasp in seeing students and Tobias laughing at Gumball's video. Tobias views other videos parodying Gumball's face. Slowly, they realize that Gumball is watching them]
Gumball: [Warily] What's that?
Tobias​​​​​​: You've gone kind of viral, dude. You're famous!
Gumball: What kind of fame is that!? This is stupid. I mean, what's next? The stupid face wearing a sombrero, shooting lasers at kittens, or something?!
[The next video shows exactly what Gumball describes. Tobias tries to block the video from Gumball discreetly]
Gumball: That's it, I'm telling the cyber police. [He walks away, but then walks back and kicks trash bin. Gumball walks away again]
The "Cyber" Police's Office
Floppy Disk: Okay. Let's have a look at these pictures, and see if I can backtrace them.
[He clicks, and a pop up appears]
Floppy Disk: Ooh! Win a new car.
[He clicks the pop up, and more of them appear]
Darwin: Come on, man. Everyone knows you shouldn't click on pop-ups.
Floppy Disk: Step back, children! It's a hacker attack! Ahh! [Imitates lazers]
Darwin: Dude, just click the pop-up-blocker option.
[He clicks it, and all the pop ups disappear one by one]
Floppy Disk: What the-? That's amazing! I must send an email to the HQ.
[He writes a note, and puts it in in the CD drive of the CPU]
Gumball: What are you doing? That's not how you send emails.
Floppy Disk: Let the professionals do their job, kid. I've been doing this since the eighties.
Darwin: What? In the future?
Floppy Disk: No. The nineteen-eighties.
Darwin: There was a nineteen?
Gumball: [Sighs] You can't delete those videos from the internet, can you?
Floppy Disk: Nooo. But I can delete the internet. Watch and learn, kid.
[He drags the internet browser application to the trash bin]
Darwin: I'm not sure that's gonna be enough.
Floppy Disk: You're right! [Takes CPU off, and throws it in the trash bin] How's that?
Darwin: [Sarcastically] Yeah, sure.
Gumball: Thank you for your help, sir.
Darwin's Video
[A camera is switched on, and Darwin is seen holding a ukulele]
Darwin: Okay. One, two, three- [Inhales deeply]
Gumball: Darwin, there's no point. The internet has no heart, man. It's like a goatee. It's made out of evil.
Darwin: Gumball, there's a beating heart in everything.
Gumball: Really? What about zombies?
Darwin: [Sighs] Okay. Everyone apart from people whose hearts don't beat.
Gumball: What about jellyfish?
Darwin: Okay, I get your point. They technically don't have hearts either, but everyone else does.
Gumball: What about lawyers?
Darwin: Ugh. Just press record, please.
[Gumball records, and Darwin starts playing his instrument, and singing]
Darwin: There's a beating heart in everything, except lawyers, zombies and jellyfish.
Look inside yourself, Internet, and think you see that you are being childish.
You are adding sombreros and lasers, to a kid who looked like he was tasered.
You laugh about it thinking it's funny, but is it, Internet? Is it really?
He's just a small boy with a heart like you, why'd you keep on trying to make him blue?
There's a beating heart in everything, and I know that there is one in you.
Come on, Internet. I know you're better than that.
[Cut to Gumball and Darwin watching an edited version of Darwin singing, his song being parodied and almost unrecognizable]
Darwin: What's wrong with the internet, man? This video goes on for at least twenty minutes!
Gumball: THAT'S IT! I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU, INTERNET! I'M COMING FOR YOU! I'M GONNA GO CYBER-WARRIOR ON YOUR BUTT!
Entering the Internet
Gumball: Du du du tun-tu tun! [Imitates airlock opening as he bends over a scanner, naked] Du du du tun-tu tun!
Darwin: Control operator to virtual soldier. Commencing digital scan process.
Gumball: [Whistles as he is scanned]
Darwin: Scanning in progress. Prepare to enter the internet in three… two… [Sees Gumball's underside] AGHH-WHAT THE-AH! ABORT! ABORT! [Types repeatedly while covering his eyes] ABORT!
In the Bathroom
[Darwin cleans his unblinking eyes with a steady stream of water]
Darwin: Mrs. Mom was right. We really didn't need that high definition scanner.
Gumball: Alright, never mind. We'll just have to find the Internet's address, and deal with this in the normal world, I guess.
Darwin: [Stops washing his eyes] Don't be ridiculous. The Internet is a thing, not a person.
Shower Handle: Yeah, dude. Can't you see the difference?
[All the things in the bathroom come to life, and laugh]
Toilet: Dumb nut.
Finding the Internet
[Gumball searches something on the computer. It chimes in]
Gumball: Ha! I knew it. The Internet lives only three blocks from here! Let's go-
[The computer suddenly chimes in]
Gumball: Oooh… one-hundred funny animals in hats… click! [Clicks]
[They scan through a gallery of funny animals wearing hats, being struck by the cuteness of each one. Much time passes as they do this]
Gumball: Aww. Okay! Let's go.
[The computer suddenly chimes in again]
Gumball: [Gasps] One-hundred greatest fails of all-time? Click! [Clicks]
Gumball and Darwin: OH!
Gumball: [Clicks]
Gumball and Darwin: AH!
Gumball: [Clicks]
Gumball and Darwin: [Covers each other's faces] [Flinches and groans]
Gumball: Dude, wait! Can't you see what's happening? The internet is tricking us with its deadliest weapon: time-wasting.
Darwin: You're right! Just one more, and then we'll go. [Clicks]
[Sounds of chanting are heard]
Gumball and Darwin: No no no no no-ohh!
[These are followed by a loud crack]
Gumball: Alright, just one more. [Clicks]
[Gumball sees his own video]
Gumball: Big mistake, internet. That was a repost.
[Cut to them running by the road]
Gumball: HA! Now that we're away from the computer, there's no way the Internet can stop us finding him!
[They stop by a pedestrian lane. The light goes green, and the duo walks across. Somewhere nearby, the internet chuckles as he watches them , and clicks something. The lights suddenly fluctuate, and go to red. Cars start passing by, and bump into each other]
Gumball: AH! Dude, the Internet is hacking into the traffic system. It's trying to get us creamed! Come on, let's run-
Darwin: Up-up-up! [Stops Gumball] No. We've been taught to always respect the rules of the road. [Cars pass by and crash into each other] These rules were invented to protect us, and they will.
[Darwin calms down, while Gumball is on his guard. The lights fluctuate, and turns green]
Darwin: Come on, it's green. [Car almost runs over him]
[More vehicles begin to pile up in the middle of the road. The traffic light tells them to stop]
Darwin: Up-up-up! Wait, stop!
[Gumball runs, and jumps over to the sidewalk, leaving Darwin behind]
Darwin: Gumball! Do you realize how dangerous that was? If you don't respect the rules, then how do you expect cars to drive safely?
[A truck comes his way. Its driver, one of the construction men tries to swerve away, and avoid Darwin]
Darwin: The rules of the road are all about trust, and you cant expect to recieve trust- [Truck passes over him, its bottom barely touching Darwin] if you don't have any trust. Know what I mean?
[Light turns green, and Darwin walks to Gumball unscathed]
Gumball: A…
Darwin: See? How hard was that?
[Many citizens crawl out of a pile of cars and other motor vehicles. Gumball gapes at them]
Gumball: A-er-uh… never mind, let's go.
[They continue. Then the Doughnut Sheriff is seen in his car, eating when suddenly the computer in his car chimes in with Gumball and Darwin's picture]
Donut Sheriff: Euh… Gumball and Darwin Watterson. Wanted for fraud, embezzlement, unlicensed practice of medicine, and-
[He sees them pass by]
Donut Sheriff: Huh? [Gasps]
[He pours his drink through his mouth, takes a bite off a sandwich and throws it away, and takes a bite off from some other foods. Then he takes a tablet, and puts it in a cup of water. He impatiently waits for it to dissolve. Then he pours the liquid through his mouth, and takes the wheel]
Donut Sheriff: Okay! [Drives]
[Gumball and Darwin run off the road. The sheriff stops his car, and chases them]
Donut Sheriff: Hey! Come back here!
[He tries to jump over his car, but instead moves through it with his butt. He gets tired after running a little]
Donut Sheriff: Wait! [Pulls out taser] Stop! I said stop!
[He screams in frustration, and shoots the taser towards the sky. Then he pants, and coughs]
Donut Sheriff: Darn it, I'm out of shape.
[A duck falls from the sky, and lands beside him]
[Cuts to the internet watching the two go to him, seemingly from a camera]
Gumball [through camera]: Okay, it's not that far now. It's just another block away.
[The internet laughs evilly, and clicks something again. The power lines near Gumball and Darwin start to surge with electricity]
Darwin: Hmm. What's that noise?
Gumball: I dunno. I can't hear over that vibrating sound.
[The internet clicks again. Darwin stops, and is almost blasted by a fire hydrant opening up on him. Then the power lines catch fire, and fall down]
Gumball: AH! Watch out!
[A post almost hits them. Then  a car crashes into the fire hydrant]
Darwin: What're we gonna do!?
Gumball: I don't know! There's no way to escape the internet! Technology is everywhere!
[The scene changes to them in the park]
Darwin: Except for the park.
Gumball: Yeah, I should have thought about this earlier.
In the Internet's Lair
Timmy: [Laughs] I can be a jerk to anyone, while I'm behind the screen, in the safety and comfort of my own home.
[The door of his room explodes, and he screams. Gumball and Darwin show up]
Timmy: Who let you in?
Gumball: Your mom.
Timmy: Mom! You let enemies in to my secret base?
[A computer beeps. It translates to "Sorry Timmy, I thought they were your friends"]
Timmy: You know very well that I have no friends!
Darwin: [Whispers to Gumball] Wow. The internet is way less impressive in real life than I thought it would be.
Gumball: Alright dude. Delete my video, now! Or you're going offline. [Grabs a plug]
Timmy: Huh? I can't! Nothing can be deleted from the Internet!
Gumball: You have five seconds. One…
Timmy: Don't you realize? Think about everything the world would lose!
Gumball: Two…
Timmy: Think about the educational content!
Gumball: Three…
Timmy: Think about the freedom of speech- [Muttering] Apart from the two thirds of the world that don't have it.
Gumball: Four…
Timmy: THINK ABOUT THE KITTIES!
Gumball: Five-!
Darwin: Wait, Gumball! He's right. Think about it...
[They think about the cute kittens for a long time]
Timmy: Yo, you okay? You're been staring at the ceiling for about fifteen minutes.
Gumball: [Affectionately] You're so beautiful.
Timmy: Really?
Gumball: [Whispering] Don't ever change, internet. You were meant to be free.
[They hug him]
Timmy: Ughhh! Physical contact!
Darwin: [Whispering affectionately] Just try and take some responsibilities for your actions from time to time.
Timmy: Never!
Gumball: And maybe try to laugh with people instead of always laughing at them.
Timmy: Yeah, that's right. Keep hoping!
Darwin: And try to remember that other people have hearts too.
Timmy: Get bent! This is the Internet you're talking to!
[Gumball and Darwin laugh, then stop. Episode ends]
