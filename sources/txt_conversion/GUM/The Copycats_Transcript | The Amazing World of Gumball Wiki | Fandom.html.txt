A New Exotic Food Section!
[The episode starts with the Wattersons at Elmore Shopping. Gumball and Darwin pass by the exotic food section]
Darwin: Gumball, look! There's a new exotic food section!
Gumball: Cowboy caviar?
Darwin: [Eats caviar] Yum! What is it?
Gumball: [Gasps] Umm... eggs? From... cowboys?
Darwin: [Gulps] I'm judging from your expression that my life will be better if I just believe that.
Gumball: [Nods and puts caviar back on the shelf] Ewww! Look at this one, Darwin! Minced fat and connective tissues in a cellulose casing, sprayed with liquid flavoring and saltwater?! That's the worst thing I've ever- Oh, what do you know, it's just hot dogs.
Darwin: It's not as weird as powdered goat milk. Who needs that?
Gumball: A lactose-intolerant astronaut.
[Both snicker and walk away. Two characters, similar-looking to Gumball and Darwin, enter the stage and perform the exact same thing as Gumball and Darwin]
Ribbit: Chi Chi, look! There's a new exotic food section!
Chi Chi: Ewww! Look at this one, Ribbit! Minced fat and connective tissues in a cellulose casing-
Gumball: [Clears throat] Uh, what is going on here?
Chi Chi: Uh, what is going on here?
Chi Chi and Gumball: [Growl and walk around each other, as if preparing to face off] You want to copy, huh? Well, copy this! [They each grab food off a shelf and begin to eat it, then laugh]
Gumball: Hah! I just made you eat cowboy caviar!
Darwin: Dude! He's standing next to the lychees!
Gumball: Wait, so... [Gags]
[Chi Chi gags]
[Gumball gags]
[Chi Chi gags]
Darwin: Stop it! It makes me wanna ralph when other people- [Gags]
[Ribbit gags]
[Gumball gags]
[Chi Chi gags]
[Darwin gags]
[Ribbit gags]
[All of them gag]
In the Car
[Cut to the Wattersons in the car]
Gumball: So, we were in the exotic food aisle, and they were copying everything we did!
Richard: Exotic food. [Smacks lips]
Darwin: They were like us, but fake, like margarine to our butter.
Richard: Margarine and butter. [Smacks lips together again]
Gumball: Seriously, it was like looking in a mirror made of meat.
Richard: Mirror. [Smacks lips again]
Gumball: Are you even listening to what we're saying?
Nicole: Oh, honey, everyone has a doppelgänger. Remember that sunburnt guy's belly that looked like Anais?
[Nicole shows her phone with a picture of a guy's sunburnt belly. Anais frowns]
Gumball: You don't understand, they were literally copying everything we— [Gasps] There they are!
[Gumball points to another family in the car driving right beside them; Both families look at each other]
Nicole: What the?
Chi Chi's mom: What the?
[The family crashes in a tollbooth. Milk Guy falls out of the booth and spills while the copycat family drives away]
The Incredible World of Chi-Chi
[Scene cuts to the Watterson's house. Gumball is on a laptop looking up a Chinese website]
Gumball: Look at this!
[A Chinese website is shown with the copycats]
Darwin: Click "translate".
[Gumball translates the page]
Gumball: Oh, here's my doppelgänger, "Chi-Chi. This goat is attention of the center. He is serious, don't you trust him? A heavy party love hero with powerful personality defectives."
[The whole family laughs]
Darwin: That makes no sense, look at mine. "Ribbit. This frog is a frog, but why? He's so green and mighty you wouldn't trust him with lunch. What's that? Yes, he is determined."
[The whole family laughs]
Richard: Apparently, "I am a tired lazy belly male lurking inside sofa. Watch him obnoxious. Laugh and spoil yourself."
[The whole family laughs]
Nicole: I think I just spoiled myself a little. Look at mine! "Wowee! What a mother! Who cares if she's annoying? You?"
[The whole family laughs]
Anais: What's my doppelgänger like?
[The whole family laughs as they keep reading their copycat bios. Anais' doppelganger comes up but says she is deleted]
Gumball: Deleted!
Anais: What?! Why?!
Gumball: Because— "Women no right to celebrate in republic of people."
[The whole family except Anais laughs]
Richard: It's funny 'cause I don't understand!
Gumball: Wait. This isn't funny at all!
Anais: Exactly. I'm not part of it because I'm a girl!
Gumball: Psh! No. I mean, these guys have their own TV show, and they're ripping us off! Look at this.
[Gumball clicks Chi-Chi's version of a scene from "The DVD", named "Mom angry much"]
Chi Chi: The kids you decided to have.
[Chi-Chi's mom angrily punches a hole in the door]
Gumball: These guys are making money out of our lives while we're broke!
Nicole: Come on, we're not that broke.
Gumball: Mom, we're so broke that we give "you-owe-mes" to charity.
Nicole: Mm, yeah, you're right. We should sue them.
Anais: Guys, a lawyer could cost way too much dough.
Richard: How much dough?
Anais: Like thousands of dollars.
Richard: I mean, how much in cookie dough?
Anais: [Sighs] Millions of tons.
[Richard tips over the couch causing everyone to fall back while Gumball looks at them; Gumball then looks at the computer screen and sees the copycats copy them]
Gumball: Wait a minute. How could they copy that? It literally just happened.
[The copycats are looking through the window watching them]
Chi Chi: It literally just happened. [Gasps as Gumball looks at him, they all hide]
Gumball: What the what?!
Chi Chi: What the what?!
Gumball: Arhhh!
Chi Chi: Arhhh!
The Confrontation
[Gumball angrily opens the front door]
Gumball: All right.
The Wattersons: Hmm.
[The Wattersons step out the door and walk up to the copycat family]
Gumball: Let's settle this in a civilized manner. [Clears throat] Hi, my name is Gumball.
Chi Chi: Hi, my name is Chi—
[Gumball tackles Chi Chi on the ground]
Gumball: Stop repeating everything I say!
Chi Chi: [Jerky] But - when - someone - says - "hi," - you - say - "hi" - too!
[Gumball tugs on Chi-Chi in utter annoyance and in belligerence. Nicole and Chi-Chi's mom use several animesque physical attacks unto another with zaps of yellow and blue lights. Gumball and Chi-Chi try to reach each other to fight but are too scared to do so]
Gumball and Chi Chi: Fight me, you coward!
[Darwin and Ribbit slap against one another]
Darwin and Ribbit: Ow! Oh, sorry.
[Darwin and Ribbit caress each others' cheeks, only to slap each other again]
Darwin and Ribbit: Ah!
[Richard and Chi Chi's dad try fighting each other also but get too tired and fight with their finger as swords. They taste each other's fingers; Gumball bumps into a stair rail as Anais watches while Nicole and Chi Chi's mom are still fighting]
Anais: Are we done here?
Nicole and Chi Chi's mom: Yeah, I think she is. [Both fall to the floor while blowing on their fists]
Anais: Okay, fighting clearly isn't working. Maybe we should help them find their own identities.
Gumball: Why should we help those bootleg butt-clowns?
Anais: Mmmm, because... in the end, isn't identity theft the most sincere form of flattery?
[The Wattersons look at their doppelgangers; worried]
Darwin: You know, Anais is right. Maybe they just need a little push in the right direction.
[Darwin approaches Ribbit and begins to sing]
Darwin: What you are doing, is straight-up criminal.
Gumball: So just try and be original.
Gumball and Darwin: Be your own you! Be your own you! Don't do what I do. Just be your own you. It's much more fun to be yourself than copy everybody else!
Richard: Be your own you!
Richard and Nicole: Be your own you!
Richard: Try something new.
Nicole: Find your own things to do.
Richard and Nicole: Copying is clearly theft, it's gonna lead to your arrest.
Gumball, Darwin, Richard, and Nicole: Be your own you! And when you've stopped being such a dirty hack, get in your stupid car, and don't come back!
Chi Chi's Family: [Copying exact line in a video] Get in your stupid car, and don't come back!
Gumball: Dagnabbit! We'll never get rid of them!
[Gumball then proceeds to slam his fists on the dinner table, causing a light to fall on him. A notification appears afterwards]
Chi Chi: Dagnabbit! We'll never get rid of them!
[Chi-Chi then proceeds to slam his fists on the dinner table, causing a light to fall on him. No notifications appear]
Anais: Wait a minute. They copy literally everything. Gumball, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Gumball: No. Chi-Chi's thinking what I'm thinking.
Anais: Exactly! Let them copy you at their own risk.
[Evil cackling laughter ensues with the Wattersons]
Anais: You guys still don't get it, do you?
Gumball, Darwin, Nicole, and Richard: No.
Anais: Just live your life as dangerously as possible and hope they off themselves trying to copy you.
Gumball, Darwin, Nicole, and Richard: Ohh!
Gumball: [Menacing] How delightfully malicious. [Starts laughing evilly]
Anais: The moment's passed now.
Gumball: Hmph.
Risky Life Choices
[Gumball is shown sleeping in his bedroom. He is subconsciously, with a pair of scissors, cutting the yellow wire connected to three sticks of electric-plugged dynamite while being used by a sensor, turning off the alarm. Gumball then heads back to sleep. In the bathroom, Richard locks himself in metal chains while in a bathtub, using his mouth, landing the key in the toilet water, Richard proceeds to soak completely in the bathtub, underwater. At the dining table, Darwin is blindfolded and chooses between milk and a biohazard, puts some milk in his cereal and proceeds to eat it, but misses it by a bit. Outside, Richard performs a trick with three chainsaws next to a tree. Gumball, Darwin, and Richard then come out of the house]
Gumball: Oh, wait. Dad, aren't you forgetting something?
Richard: I left the iron on. I left the candle burning next to the curtains. [Gasp] I forgot to leave the stove on!
[Richard goes to leave the stove on]
[Richard comes back as he, Gumball, and Darwin walk; in the background the house blows up and Richard, Darwin, and Gumball proceed to jump in the car. They balance it on two tires while the driver, Nicole, reads the newspaper atop the side that leans upward]
Gumball: Where are we going?
Richard: To the hospital. I'm gonna donate an organ of their choice.
[The car breaks through the entrance window of the hospital]
[Cut to the Watterson abode, where Anais types for potential mimicry of the Wattersons, specifically Richard. Nicole breaks the through the window onto the couch, Gumball and Darwin ride on a hoverboard/rollercoaster vehicle and duck down to the floor, then proceeded by Richard walking on high heels]
[A notification appears yet again on video, the dad copycat gets a kidney transplant]
Richard: What? They gave him my kidney and then he donated it to someone else?!
Gumball: [Sighs] I guess we're going to have to take this one step further.
Gumball, Darwin, Nicole, and Richard: Mm-hmm.
Dangerous Truck Stunts
Anais: Uh, guys?!
[Scene cuts to Anais sitting inside a vehicle]
Anais: Am I the only one who understands what it means to go one step further than almost  kicking the bucket?!
[The Wattersons are seen inside a truck driving on the expressway with a tank and fire following them]
Anais: This is a terrible idea!
Gumball: Then why'd you come along?
Anais: Because... I'm tired of being left out.
Richard: Okay. So, what do we do now?
Nicole: I think the time has come to scream helplessly.
Gumball, Darwin, Nicole, and Richard: Ahhhh!
Anais: Shush! Think! Has anyone got an idea?!
Richard: Yes! We go faster?
[Gumball, Darwin, Anais, and Nicole look ahead and see the cliff of the broken bridge]
Richard: We go slower?
[Gumball, Darwin, Anais, and Nicole look to the back of the truck with the oil and fire following them]
Richard: Uh... then no.
Gumball: [Gasps] I've got this.
[Gumball tries blowing out the fire at the end of the truck but doesn't help; Gumball returns to his seat in vain]
Gumball: Never mind.
[Nicole swerves the truck to avoid obstacles while they all scream]
Nicole: Has anyone else got an idea?
Darwin: We jump.
[The family jumps out of the truck but rolls back inside]
Gumball: Okay, back to screaming?
[The family goes back to screaming helplessly]
Anais: Wait! I've got an idea! We need to unhook the tank.
Nicole: How? The space between the truck and the tank is too tight.
Anais: For you guys maybe, but not for me.
[Anais gets out of the truck and start making her way to the tank while Nicole looks at her. Anais finds the link and tries reaching it. Anais then finally unhooks the tank as she gets back in the truck; A big explosion happens after with a cloud filled with smoke]
Nicole: [Sighs] Good job, sweethea-Ahhhhh! [Looks ahead of the road and steps on the brake]
[The truck stops right on time and the family gets out]
[The Wattersons laugh in relief because they barely went uninjured]
Gumball: We're alive!
Anais: I guess they should've kept the little sister.
Gumball: What do you mean?
[Anais points to the copycats' truck]
[The copycats scream as they descend and crash]
Gumball: Uh, you guys good?
[The burning crashed truck explodes and the copycats are still alive but in very extreme pain]
Chi Chi: Nooo...
Gumball: Eh, good enough.
Irreplaceable
[Cuts to Wattersons' house; Gumball searches his rip-off and no results are available]
Gumball: Nope. No more videos. I guess they're too messed up to be on TV now.
Darwin: That'll teach them for trying to replace us!
[A glitch causes the voice actors to switch]
Gumball: [In new voice] Yeah, as if anyone else can do what I do!
Darwin: [In new voice] Yeah! We're irreplaceable!
[Gumball and Darwin laugh amidst the fact their copycats exist no more. But stop laughing and shock to realize they switched voice actors due to glitches; the episode ends]
