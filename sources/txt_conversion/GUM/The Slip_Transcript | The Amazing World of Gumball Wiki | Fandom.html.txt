The Elusive Package
[Episode starts with Richard in the bathtub, roleplaying as two rubber ducks, with one of them wearing a beard made of soap bubbles]
Richard: [As first duck] Did you bring the money?
Richard: [As second duck] Ten quacks million dollars. It's all in the sponge.
Richard: [As first duck] Good!
[He pushes a toy sailboat towards the ducks]
Richard: [As sailboat] Freeze! This is the U.S. Government! You're under arrest for bath time crimes.
Richard: [As first duck] What?! You double quack-crossed me, Professor?
Richard: [As second duck] I'm not the quack professor! [Washes off the duck's bubble beard]
Richard: [As first duck; gasps] The beard was fake?! It's like Budapest all over again!
[The doorbell rings]
Richard: Can someone get that? Anyone? [Groans]
[He steps outside, with a towel on his head, wrapped in toilet paper, and wearing a bath mat cape with a toilet brush tied on. He notices a slip of paper on the doormat and reads it.]
Richard: Hmm? "Sorry we missed you." Darn it, that was the final piece of my subscription jigsaw! I still have no idea what it's gonna be.
[Flashback to the jigsaw; it's a simple four-piece puzzle of an apple. Richard goes inside, where Gumball and Darwin are lazing around]
Richard: Why didn't you guys answer the door?!
Gumball: Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot we were your personal butlers.
Darwin: [British accent] How would His Lordship like his eggs?
Richard: In a bucket, smothered with more eggs—Wait a minute! Don't distract me! [A car is heard outside] The delivery guy's still out there! [He dashes to the window] He's walking towards his truck! He's reached his truck! He's opening one of the back doors of his truck! He's putting my package into the back of his truck! He's adjusting his pants! He's still adjusting his—
Gumball and Darwin: Just get out there and talk to him!
[Outside, Mr. Gruber, the delivery man, scans Richard’s package while whistling]
Richard: I caught you. I can take my package now.
Mr. Gruber: I'm sorry?
Richard: [Chuckles] You're confused. From my fancy clothes, you must think I'm some sort of wealthy lord, but I am actually Richard Watterson, and that package is for me. So, I'll take it.
[Mr. Gruber starts laughing. Richard nervously laughs with him, but when he stops, Mr. Gruber continues laughing]
Mr. Gruber: No. The package has been entered into the system as undelivered. It will be returned to the depot as per subsection thirty-seven B of company procedure.
Richard: But I can see it. Can't you just give it to me?
Mr. Gruber: [Mockingly] Yeah! Sure! I'll just give it to you! [Holds out the package to Richard but quickly swipes it away] If rules and regulations mean nothing to you.
Richard: So I can have it?
Mr. Gruber: Do you know where we'd be without rules and regulations?
Richard: Right here but I'd have my package?
Mr. Gruber: Life would be like a giant cage fight... without the cage.
[He puts the package into the back of his truck and closes it. Richard runs to the front of the truck as he is leaving.]
Richard: Wait!
Mr. Gruber: You missed the delivery, you could pick it up at the depot or pay for a redelivery, the choice is yours. Good day, sir!
[He speeds off. Richard goes back inside]
Richard: Ah, there's no way I'm going to the depot! And I don't wanna pay ten bucks for a redelivery.
Gumball: Well, just lie. Then they'll have to redeliver for free.
Richard: Great idea! [Dials up phone] I'll tell them I'm a ghost who couldn't open the front door because I don't have a physical body, and that they shouldn't discriminate against me because of my spirit status!
Gumball: Or just say the delivery guy didn't ring the doorbell.
Richard: Eh, I like mine better, but okay.
You Lied!
[Richard is staring at his unfinished jigsaw.]
Richard: Come on, Richard. What could it possibly be?
[He tries to imagine the possibilities: a pizza, a foot, a chimney, and an eyeball. The doorbell rings, interrupting his thoughts. Gumball and Darwin open the door]
Gumball: Uh, Dad!
[He comes over. Scraps of paper placed on the doormat from the delivery slip are shown, saying "YOU LIED!"]
Richard: "You lied"?
Gumball: You know who did this, right?
Richard: [Sinister] Darwin!
Gumball: No, the delivery guy!
[Mr. Gruber is on the sidewalk, glaring at Richard.]
Richard: Oh, yeah.
Mr. Gruber: How dare you lie and say I didn't ring the doorbell?! You have dragged my spotless reputation through the dirt! What was once perfect and pure has been ruined. [Zoom-in] Like a white dove wearing hoop earrings.
Gumball: Listen, dude. All he wants is his package.
Mr. Gruber: Company policy allows only three deliveries per item. You missed the first delivery, therefore, you have two remaining. Miss them, and you will have to drag your lazy lying butt to the depot!
Richard: You monster! You know how long the lines are at the depot! There's not enough of my life left!
Mr. Gruber: [Mockingly] Oh, what's the matter? No need to cry about it! [Flutters his hands in a strange manner.] Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Boo-hoo-hoo! Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Gumball: Uh, I think he means this. [Moves his hands in a crying fashion]
Mr. Gruber: Sorry, can't do mime. Love it, can't do it. Anyway, the game is on! [Goes into his truck and speeds away]
Richard: Right! There's no way I'm missing that delivery again! Nothing's gonna distract me! I'm gonna stand right here until that guy comes back!
Gumball and Darwin: Meh, whatever.
[They walk inside, and right as they do, Richard is on the couch]
Gumball: What the—Dad!
Richard: Yeah, standing up was hurting my legs, and I can't see the TV from out there.
Darwin: But you can't see the delivery guy from in here!
Richard: Yeah, I can. I'll see him in the reflection in the corner of the TV, and nothing's gonna distract me!
[An ice cream truck is playing music outside.]
Richard: Ah! Ice cream! [Giggles]
[He looks through the window. The truck says "FREE Ice Cream" on it. Mr. Gruber, inside the truck, chuckles evilly]
Richard: No, no, no. Stay strong. [notices the "FREE" and gasps] Free ice cream! Oh, come on, Richard, you can do this!
[Mr. Gruber writes "For Richard Watterson" under the top message.]
Richard: Free ice cream for Richard Watterson?! No! I will not under any circumstances let this distract me!
[It is revealed that he has broken off the wall, and he is in front of the ice cream truck]
Richard: Can I have chocolate sprinkles?
Mr. Gruber: But of course, Mr. Watterson. [Hands him his ice cream]
Richard: [Throws away the window and reaches for his ice cream] Wait, I know that voice.
Mr. Gruber: No, you don't.
Richard: No, I don't.
Mr. Gruber: Come and get it! [Drives forward repeatedly] Little bit further, little bit further, little bit further, little bit further...
[Richard does not keep up as the truck drives forward. Gumball and Darwin watch from where the broken-off wall had been]
Gumball: Eh, we better go get him.
[Mr. Gruber and Richard have gone all the way out to the desert. Dehydrated, Richard still continues his efforts to reach the ice cream]
Mr. Gruber: Little bit further, little bit further. Nearly there. [Stops] I think that's far enough. So, here is your ice cream, [Shows himself] Mister Watterson!
Richard: You! But how?!
Mr. Gruber: [Laughs] Did I not mention that my brother Hans has an ice cream truck?! He let me borrow it, since he is in the hospital with appendicitis. [Laughs] Just to clarify, I am laughing because of my plan, not because my brother is in the hospital. Anyway, packages to deliver! [Speeds off]
[Richard's phone vibrates in his pocket.]
Richard: Hello? [Accidentally smashes his ice cream cone up to his ear.] Ahh!
[Richard grabs his real phone from his pocket. He receives a message: a video of Mr. Gruber leaving the package at his door and ringing the doorbell. He waits for all of three seconds]
Mr. Gruber: Oh, nobody home. That's one delivery left, Mr. Watterson, but don't give up, unless you're.... chicken!
[Mr. Gruber clucks like a chicken while imitating an elephant in gesture. Richard crushes his cone in anger and opens up his hand. Inside reveals another missed delivery slip. He faints, and Gumball and Darwin are shown next to him]
Gumball: [Looks at video] Yeah, that's an elephant.
Mr. Gruber's Dirty Tricks
[Back home, Richard is spying through the mail slot]
Darwin: Oh, come on, Mr. Dad! You've been there for four hours!
Richard: He tricked me out of that last delivery, and now there's only one left. There's no way he'll get me again! [Phone rings] I'll get it! [Picks it up]
Mr. Gruber: [Through the phone] Hello, honey. This is me, your wife.
Richard: You don't sound like my wife Nicole. If you're my wife Nicole, answer me this. What's your name?
Mr. Gruber: Mmm... Nicole?
Richard: Hmm, seems watertight. So, what's up, honey?
Mr. Gruber: I'm in the hospital! Come quick! My heart has... fallen off!
Richard: Quick, into the car! No time to explain!
[Richard, Gumball, and Darwin leave]
Mr, Gruber: [Cackles] I'm not really his wife.
[Richard, Gumball and Darwin drive to the hospital. Richard inaudibly speaks to a receptionist, only to find that on the bed is a pile of missed delivery slips in the shape of Nicole]
Richard: Ahh! Nicole's got a disease that turns people's skin into missed delivery slips!
Bandage Doctor: Please, keep it down! There are other people in this ward trying to pull off cruel and elaborate pranks as well! [Slams the door]
[A brick is thrown onto the bed from outside. Richard unties the note; it is a photo of Mr. Gruber leaving the package at their doorstep a third time]
Richard: [Screams] He's done it again!
[Mr. Gruber starts talking through a walkie-talkie nestled in a bouquet of flowers by the bed]
Mr. Gruber: Ah, Mr. Watterson.
Richard: [Screams] How do those flowers know my name?!
Mr. Gruber: It appears you missed your final delivery, but I'm willing to give you a last chance. Your package will be at a collection point. But where, I hear you ask. [Silence] Ask this in!
Gumball, Oh, I thought that was rhetorical.
Gumball, Darwin, and Richard: Where?
[Mr. Gruber is shown calling them from a collection point at the mall]
Mr. Gruber: Where can I go shopping in the rain, but I don't get wet?
Richard: Online!
Mr. Gruber: Oh, yeah, I guess online works, too. Well, your package will be at the Elmore Mall, where it will remain for the next four minutes precisely. Tick tock, Watterson.
[Gumball, Darwin, and Richard gasp and run off]
Mr. Gruber: [Laughs] I'm not really a bunch of flowers.
The Lazy Man's Vengeance
[Gumball, Darwin, and Richard are at the hospital entrance, where they see their car being towed away.]
Richard: Oh, no! He clamped the car!
Gumball: Yeah, I don't think that was him. [Points to a sign that says, "No Parking / Ambulances Only"]
Richard: Well, I guess we'll have to get there on foot, and we've only got three minutes! [Zoom-in] We can do this!
[The three finally make it to the collection point at the mall, panting from exhaustion]
Richard: We made it! And only thirty-eight minutes late.
[Darwin opens the package door with no package inside]
Darwin: [Gasps] It's empty!
Richard: No!
[Richard's phone buzzes; another message from Mr. Gruber plays]
Mr. Gruber: You're late, Watterson, but I'll give you one more chance to get your package. You can find it in the building that houses all the old fossils that no one ever goes to visit.
Richard: The retirement home!
Mr. Gruber: Uh, yeah, that works too, but the package will be at the museum for the next five minutes.
Richard: Let's go!
[He starts to run, but Gumball pulls him back]
Gumball: Dad, no, no! Why are you letting him mess with you like this?
Richard: Because honest, hardworking, by-the-book, set-the-alarm guys like him always win! I'm doing this for the slobs everywhere, for the guy who orders the wrong thing online but is then too lazy to return it!
[Richard's words catch the attention of many mall patrons.]
Pantsbully: Hey! I'm that guy!
Richard: For the guy who pays two cellphone bills per year because he can't be bothered to cancel one of them!
Melted Cheese Guy: Ha! I'm payin' for three!
Richard: And for the guy who can't even be bothered to finish his sentence!
Teapot: Hey, I'm totally, uhh...
Richard: He thinks he can take advantage of our laziness, but today, the lazy man lifts a finger! Who's with me?!
[The lazy people throughout the mall collectively mumble. Richard sighs]
Darwin: We're with you, Mister Dad! Let's go get that package! [Grabs Richard's arm and the three take off.]
The Great Package Chase
[Gumball, Darwin, and Richard run across town. Mr. Gruber talks through Richard's phone]
Mr. Gruber: Elmore Museum! Four minutes!
[Richard opens the collection point on top of a dinosaur skeleton, finding no package. The skeleton breaks]
Mr. Gruber: The toxic waste disposal site! Three minutes!
[At the toxic waste disposal site, the Wattersons open the collection point to find no package, and the collection point sinks in glowing sewage.]
Mr. Gruber: The stadium end zone! Five minutes!
[In the middle of the football field, Richard opens the collection point and there is a football inside. He promptly gets tackled by the players]
Mr. Gruber: The Elmore runway! Six minutes!
[The collection point is on a plane taking off. Richard reaches for it, but falls off the plane.]
Mr. Gruber: The tanning salon!
[At the tanning salon, Richard opens the tanning bed on Principal Brown, completely shaved and reading a book. Richard screams]
Mr. Gruber: The sewers!
[Darwin reaches for a collection point in the sewer water, but an alligator comes out and chases him.]
Mr. Gruber: The kitten orphanage!
[Covered in and tackled by kittens, Gumball opens a package door. They keep quickly opening doors as Mr. Gruber keeps naming places.]
Mr. Gruber: Precious Late and Ten Emporium! Fabio's Downtown Duvet Bunker! The stage of the Dad Wake Up Awards!
[Richard wakes up on the stage. The Shooting Star hands him a trophy]
Gumball and Darwin: Dad! Wake up!
Richard: [Screams] I fell asleep at the DWAs! How embarrassing...
Gumball and Darwin: Dad! Wake up!
[Richard wakes up again for real, revealing that they are at a collection point under the interstate. A public phone rings, and Richard answers it]
Richard: Hello?
Mr. Gruber: Ready to give up? You'll never find me, and you'll never get your package. [Laughs]
Richard: That's nuts. [Hangs up]
Gumball: Aw, I'm sorry, Dad. I guess he's won.
Richard: Shh!
Darwin: What's he doing?
Gumball: I think he's deflating!
Richard: Did you hear it? The frying sound? It's peanut oil! At 180.47 degrees. [Images revolve around him like a computer screen as he thinks out loud] There are only three restaurants that use that kind of oil: Joyful Burger, but they switched to lard substitute because it was cheaper! Sloppy John's Filthy Burgers, but they were shut down because of that whole rat burger incident! That only leaves that diner next to the pet cemetery, but they shut that down seemingly for no reason! This doesn't make any sense! Wait! Unless it isn't a restaurant, it's a food truck! Diagnosis Burger, on the interstate! But I'll never get there in time!
Gumball: You will, Dad! You just need to trust your inner slob!
[At Diagnosis Burger, the Cowboy flips burgers while Mr. Gruber laughs on the phone]
Mr. Gruber: [Laughs] That's weird, he hung up after he said "That's nuts."
Cowboy: Yeah! Peanut oil! I've cooked with it for years!
Mr. Gruber: Watterson couldn't know just from the sound!
Cowboy: Did you say Watterson? That guy's my best customer! He even comes on vacation with me!
Mr. Gruber: Well, if he comes by here, keep it zipped! Understand? Zipped! Ah, what am I even worrying about? He'll never find me! He's too lazy. [Looks up at an airplane flying above] No! That's not possible!
[Richard, covered in stamps, is about to drop from the plane]
Richard: Deliver me.
[Gary and Jeff push him off. Mr. Gruber tries to start his truck, but it won't start.]
Mr. Gruber: Come on! Come on! [The truck starts] Yah!
[He starts driving, but Richard falls straight into the back of the truck. His parachute deployed, Richard comes out the back, holding his package high.]
Richard: My package!
Mr. Gruber: [Snatchess package] Nein! That package is property of the U.S. Mail, and it's going back to the depot where it belongs!
[Closes the back of the truck, then quickly reopens it]
Mr. Gruber: Sorry, I realized you're still in my truck. Get out. [Gets back in] I win, you lose, good day, sir! [Speeds off laughing]
A Win for the Slobs
[Mr. Gruber laughs as he drives off. "Ode to Joy" plays and a montage starts of him laughing as he puts a package on the conveyor belt, has a fancy dinner, sleeps, gets dressed, has breakfast, brushes his teeth, punches in at the post office, puts a package into his truck, and delivers it to the Watterson house. Richard opens the door, smirking]
Mr. Gruber: Huh?! But... your package is still at the depot!
Richard: Yeah, I just ordered the exact same thing. Seemed like less effort.
Mr. Gruber: What? Rather than going to collect your package, you bought the same thing all over again?! How could you get any lazier?!
Richard: I'll tell you how. My son thought of the idea because I couldn't be bothered.
Mr. Gruber: That doesn't mean you've won!
Richard: Actually, it does. [Sumgly] Good day, sir. [Slams door]
Mr. Gruber: Nooooooo!
[He drops to his knees and mimes pulling a rope. Episode ends]
