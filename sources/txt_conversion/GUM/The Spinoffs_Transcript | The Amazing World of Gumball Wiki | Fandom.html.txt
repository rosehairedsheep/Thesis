The Amazing World Without Gumball
[The episode begins with the opening credits being interrupted; it now shows Rob with Timmy]
Rob​: [Evilly, to camera] Your program has been interrupted. With the help of my friend, the Internet. I'm hereby hijacking this broadcast. People of the world, you don't need that false hero! Please enjoy this amazing world!
[Rob holds up a VHS tape showing the show's title in white, but "GUMBALL" is scribbled on with a red marker]
Rob​: Without Gumball! [Normally] Trust me, it's much better.
[Rob inserts the tape into the VHS, plays the video, and it plays a live action sock puppet dancing]
Rob​: [Shocked] What? What is that?
Timmy​​: Well, I'm the Internet. It's kind of what I do.
Rob​​​​​​: Wha- uh-
[Rob sighs and facepalms; switching the TV source to VHS]
Rob​: [Off-screen] Let's just run the tape.
Joseph A. Banana's Afterschool Stories
[The tape then plays "Joseph A. Banana's Afterschool Stories" (which entails Banana Joe's life)]
Banana Bob​​​​​​​: [Screen on a young Banana Joe] Um, son, I know this might be difficult to understand, but, your mother and I feel like we need some distance between us.
Banana Barbara: Nothing will change between you and I. It's just between ourselves.
Banana Bob​​​​​​​: Son...
Banana Barbara and Banana Bob​​​​: We're splitting up!
[Banana Bob and Banana Barbara literally split up from being united, and soon start dancing with Banana Joe]
Tina the Dinosaur
[Tape cuts to next spinoff: "Tina the Dinosaur", a children's show. Kayvon, Charlie-Ann, Little Timmy, and the Yogurt Cup Kid are in front of a farm backdrop]
Narrator: Hello, children!
Kayvon, Charile-Ann, Timmy the Frog, and Yogurt Cup Kid: Hello!
Narrator: But what is going on? Where is Tina? [The kids look around] Could she be in the wheelbarrow?
Kayvon, Charile-Ann, Timmy the Frog, and Yogurt Cup Kid: Hahaha! [They look; no Tina there] No!
Narrator: Maybe she's in the bushes!
Kayvon, Charile-Ann, Timmy the Frog, and Yogurt Cup Kid: Ha ha ha! [They try the bushes; no Tina there] No...
Narrator: Well, maybe in the barn!
[The kids open the barn doors. Tina jumps out roaring, and the kids scream and run off crying as Tina destroys the set]
Narrator: RUN, CHILDREN! RUN! RUN! RUN!
[Tina roars at the camera, causing the lens to crack]
Barcode Cowboy
[Tape cuts to the next spinoff: Barcode Cowboy, an anime-style intro featuring Larry. He shoots his scanner, mops the floor, wheels crates, flips a "Closed" sign around, and uses the sprayer as words run across the background. He strikes various poses as his name flashes across the screen. Then, he gets ready to deliver some pizza: he hangs up the phone, puts his helmet on, and revs up his motorcycle. The words "Delicious Pizza" come onscreen. He takes off! Next he does some more odd jobs: delivering mail, washing windows, serving food, unclogging a toilet. Some shots of him in different hats. Then, he shoots at various purchases with his scanner while running. He blows on his smoking scanner and aims it at the screen. The title comes on: BARCODE COWBOY. Cut to reality: he is scanning some items for the Dolphin Lady while looking very bored]
Larry: That'll be twelve ninety-nine.
[Another fanfare as the title comes on again.]
Bobert's Kitchen
[Tape cuts to next segment: Bobert's Kitchen, a cooking show. Various live-action shots of food are shown, and then the title comes on. Fade to Bobert and Felicity in a kitchen]
Bobert: Good morning, and welcome to Bobert's Kitchen.
Felicity: And what will you be preparing today, Chef?
Bobert: Today I will communicate information on the process required to prepare fuel for a carbon-based life form.
Felicity: Oh, b-b-b-but...uhhh, that sounds delicious!
Bobert: Start by processing your proteins and carbohydrates, using your hyper-pulse laser.
[Bobert fires his laser at all the ingredients, dicing them]
Bobert: Use your quantum beam to place the result in a heat-resistant item of cookware.
[With a beam, Bobert gathers all the ingredients and drops them into a bowl]
Bobert: Next, add the oil [Adds oil into the bowl] and cook for six point seventy-two seconds at eighteen-thousand seven-hundred degrees Centigrade.
[Long pause. Nothing happens]
Felicity: [Whispering] Uh, what are we waiting for?
[The ingredients melt into slush]
Bobert: The operation is complete.
Felicity: Oooooh! Heh-heh!
Bobert: I used my atomic core to irradiate the surroundings.
Felicity: Ooh--is that safe?
Bobert: Affirmative. It is perfectly safe. For me. [Felicity shudders] Then add more oil and the remaining ingredients.
Felicity: Just a second. [Covers her mouth, whispering] I did not sign up for this!
[A hand grows on her finger]
Felicity: U-urgh!
[A feeding tube comes out of the food processor and attaches itself to her mouth. She lets out a muffled scream]
Bobert: Then begin the feeding process.
[The food goes through the feeding tube all at once. Felicity swallows it forcefully and pulls off the tube]
Felicity: [Wipes some drool off her mouth] That was such a...strong flavor! What kind of oil was that?
Bobert: Android oil.
Felicity: Oh, and what part of the world does it come from?
Bobert: It is locally sourced.
[Bobert turns around, holding an empty glass in front of him. When he turns back, it is full of oil. Felicity is speechless]
Bobert: I also switched the beef for a more sustainable breed of protein.
Felicity: Oh, sustainable! Very good!
Bobert: Rat meat. But remember to first remove the teeth and claws.
Felicity: Well, that's the- [Gags] -the end of our- [Gags] -our show. Please tune in-[Gags] -tune in next week for our- [Gags] -next episode.
[Felicity stumbles around for a bit before collapsing to the ground]
Techno Power Teenage Warriors
[The next segment is Techno Power Teenage Warriors, a Power Rangers-style action cartoon starring Carlton and Troy. They face a giant monster on the Richwood High tennis courts]
Carlton: Troy! What do we do, man?
Troy: We have no choice, Carlton! We have to use our powers!
[They raise their fists, wearing super-powered watches]
Carlton and Troy: Techno Power! Activate!
[Colored lightning sizzles from the watches, and a giant robot appears in a flash of light]
Carlton: Techno Robot! Attack the—
[His line is cut off by a commercial break bumper, followed by a live-action commercial for a toy version of Carlton and Troy's robot]
Commercial Voice: Buy the new Techno Robot and help Troy and Carlton save the world! [The show's theme tune plays. Cut back to the show]
Carlton: Okay... Techno Robot! Attack it!
Troy: It's no use! We need more!
Carlton: More what? We haven't even used the robot!
[They activate their watches again]
Carlton and Troy: Techno Power! Activate!
[This time, they summon an armored T-Rex]

[His line is cut off again by a commercial break bumper, followed by another commercial for a toy of the dinosaur]
Commercial Voice: Buy the new Techno Dino and help Troy and Carlton save the world! [The show's theme tune plays again. Cut back to the show]
Carlton: Right. So, should we get on with it, or—
Troy: NO! WE NEED MORE!!
[Now, they summon a giant mechanical grasshopper shaped like a motorbike]
Carlton: Okay. Cool. Like, what's the tactical advantage here? That doesn't look—
[His line is cut off yet again by a commercial break bumper, followed by a third commercial, showing a credit card]
Commercial Voice: Are your parents struggling to pay for your Techno toys? Make them apply for the Techno Power Gold Card, and help Troy and Carlton save the world!
[The theme tune plays again. Cut back to the show, where the rival monster has destroyed the entire tennis court while Troy keeps summoning monsters]
Carlton and Troy: Activate! Activate! Activate! Activate!
William & Tobias
[Next show is William & Tobias, a 90s-style family sitcom starring the two classmates. Their show starts at Joyful Burger, where Tobias approaches William at a booth]
Tobias​​: Hey, big eye! What's up?
[William says nothing, there's a short pause. Rob walks in]
Rob​​​​​​​​​: Okay, okay! Cut! Cut! William, you're supposed to take a sip and then say, "I got a date, Tobias, but she thinks I'm in the tennis club." Then, Tobias says...
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: "Join the tennis club, then!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​: Very good! Then you say, "Are you crazy? What do you think will happen to me at a tennis club?"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: And then I say, "Oh, yeah. They might mistake you for the ball."
Rob​​​​​​​​​: Alright, then you say, "What? No, I'm scared of getting tennis elbow!" Got it? Okay! Everyone on their marks! Let's go! [Claps his hands and walks off] Okay, action! And... take a sip!
[William dunks himself into his mug and warps the room. Rob walks back in]
Rob​​​​​​​​​: No, no, no! Your line, man! You're supposed to say—
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: He did! He did! You just can't hear it! He's using some kind of telepathic—
Rob​​​​​​​​​: Then say it louder this time, please! Action! [Claps his hands and walks off]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: No! No! Nononono! Wait!
[William warps the room again and Tobias grows a little more melted]
Rob​​​​​​​​​: [Off-screen] Cut! William, make an effort, please! I need everyone on set to hear what you say! Come on! Diction, diction, action!
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: [Strained] No, wait!
[William warps the room again, causing the screen to break. The TV signal is lost]
Reality Toddlers
[Next up is Reality Toddlers, a reality show documenting the struggles of the daycare kids. They are each introduced in a reality-show fashion]
Narrator: This is Kayvon.
[A blurb on-screen reads, "I'm not afraid of saying what I think. I just don't know how to say it yet."]
Narrator: This is Timmy.
[His blurb says, "I baby talk the talk, and I crawl the walk."]
Narrator: This is Charlie-Ann.
[Hers says, "And if I had to describe myself in one word it would be Charlie-Ann."]
Narrator: This is Peggy.
[Hers reads, "If you mess with me I'll chew you out... in a couple of months. I don't have teeth yet."]
Narrator: And this... [Clips of the toddlers are shown] is Reality Toddlers.
[The logo appears]
Narrator: Little Timmy was having a nice day.
[Switch to Timmy at daycare playing with a dinosaur and a toy person]
Narrator: Until disaster struck!
[Snapshots of the surprised toddlers flash onscreen]
Narrator: Timmy the Dinosaur's jaw was too small to bite the head off Dr. Mustache!
[Timmy rolls on the floor crying. Charlie-Ann pushes a chair up to him]
Narrator: There's more drama when Charlie-Ann gets thrown into the mix!
[She accidentally pushes the chair onto his foot and it gets stuck]
Narrator: The chair wouldn't go any further, even though she kept pushing.
[Charlie-Ann bursts into tears. Peggy walks over, dragging a teddy bear]
Narrator: Will Peggy seize the chance to come between Charlie-Ann and Timmy? Will there be drama during nap time? Will we just cut to more dramatic shots of nothing happening?! Will someone please cancel this show and put us all out of our misery?! The answer is in next week's episode of... Reality Toddlers.
[The logo appears again]
Everyday Heroes
[The last program is Everyday Heroes, a documentary-styled program centering on Ocho. The show opens in the Elmore Junior High courtyard. Students run around and play while Ocho lonesomely watches]
Narrator: We're here to tell you the story of a boy. A boy who was born different. Welcome to Everyday Heroes.
[The title appears in a freeze frame. Fade to Ocho in the hall, opening his locker and walking down the hall]
Narrator: Ocho might look like the average Elmore High teenager, but life was not always this easy, for he was born with three pairs of legs. This was the story of the boy who had three butts. [Fade to black]
[Open on Ocho in the classroom, talking to the camera]
Ocho: I guess I....yeah, no, it's never been that easy, having three butts. Like, they don't really sell underwear for people with that many legs. So I have to buy black gloves, cut the fingers off, and poke another hole in them.
[Cut to Ocho reading in the courtyard, his back turned to Leslie, Carmen, and Clayton, who are chatting and laughing. Ocho narrates over the next couple shots]
Ocho: [Voice-over] I always worry about what the other kids will say behind my back, because, well, I've got a few of them.
[Shots of Ocho on the school bus, and in the classroom, despondently watching Tobias and Bobert talking]
Ocho: [Voice-over] Back in the day, people used to call me names like The Three Buttsketeers, they said I won the jack-butt, asked me if my toots sounded like a church organ...
[Back to Ocho in the classroom, talking to the camera]
Ocho: It made me kinda defensive. So, now I'm generally a bit tense.
[Ocho narrates over various snapshots of him spending time with his friends: playing a video game with Juke and Carmen, laughing with Rocky in the cafeteria, lying in the grass with Molly and Sarah]
Ocho: [Voice-over] You gotta move on. It's like my mom says: two heads are better than one, and three butts are better than none. Which I guess is true.
[One last shot of Ocho talking to the camera in the courtyard]
Ocho: Imagine if I had no butt. [He runs off to join Juke, Tobias, and Carmen in a game of basketball]
Narrator: Join us next week for another inspiring story of everyday heroes: the mouth-breathing man.
[Cut to the Doughnut Sheriff loudly mouth-breathing]
A Brand-New Show
[The camera cuts to static, then back to Rob and Timmy in the basement]
Rob​​​: OKAY ALRIGHT STOP! [Tosses away the remote] Oh no, this-this is not gonna work. [Snaps his fingers at Timmy] Okay, you! Give me a character that is optimistic, fun, and that all the children will love.
Timmy: Eh... [Scrolls through some text] Okay, I think I got one! He's a dog--you know some kind of Great Dane that can't speak properly, and he's got all these kooky friends who wear flare trousers, and they solve mysteries in a van.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​: Great! [To the camera] Then from now on, children, you should give up on Gumball, and watch this other guy!
Timmy: Yeah, but... isn't that on a different channel? So...
Rob​​​​​​​​​​: [Frantically reaches for the camera] No, no, no!! WAIT!!!
[The camera switches off. Episode ends]
