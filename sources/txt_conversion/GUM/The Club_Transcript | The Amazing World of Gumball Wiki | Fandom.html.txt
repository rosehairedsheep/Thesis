Club Searching
[Episode starts in school]
Richard: [Panting] Come on, you guys! We're gonna be late!
Gumball: Remind me again why exactly we're at school on a Saturday.
Richard: Are you kidding me? It's club day. It's the only day of the week when I get to hang out with people I really like.
Gumball, Darwin, Nicole, and Anais: [Angrily] What?!
Richard: Uhh... Got to go!
Nicole: Okay... See you all back here at five.
Gumball: But wait! I don't have a club to go to!
[Nicole starts walking to her club but Gumball stops her]
Gumball: Well, Mom, looks like it's your lucky day. I'm coming with you to your anger-management club.
Nicole: Oh, that's sweet, Gumball, but behind this door, I'm a very different person. Trust me, you don't want to see this. [Enters the room]
Mister Small​​: Hello, Nicole, welcome to— Aaach! [Flies out of the room] Uuuuuh. [Passes out]
Anais: [Opens the door on the opposite] Could you guys keep it down a little?
Nicole: You keep it down!
Gumball: Hey, Anais. What club are you in?
Anais: Physics club.
Gumball: Well, today's your lucky day, because I—
Anais: Let me stop you right there. You know there are different types of intelligence?
Gumball: Yeah.
Anais: I don't think you have any of them.
Gumball: I don't get it.
Anais: Exactly.
Gumball: Oh, come on!
[Anais slams the door]
Gumball: Oh, let me in! [Grunts] Don't be a club hog [Scoffs] Fine.
[Gumball walks to the door of the Fantasy Club room]
Gumball: Dad, can I join your fantasy club?
[Richard peeks from the door curtain]
Richard: [In Scottish accent] Who be there?
Gumball: It's me, Gumball.
Richard: Be you orc?
Gumball: No.
Richard: Be you dwarf?
Gumball: No, I'm your son.
Richard: Be you bearer of savory snacks for the elders?
Gumball: What? No.
Richard: Then begone! [Closes the curtain]
Gumball: [Sighs]
Darwin: What's up?
Gumball: Man, there's got to be a club for me somewhere.
Darwin: You could always join my club.
Gumball: What is it?
[Scene cuts to the school swimming pool, with Darwin swimming with other members of the club]
Darwin: Synchronized swimming!
Gumball: Hmmm. You're good, but I can do better. Here comes the swan dive of eternal beauty!
[Gumball jumps off the high dive and a swan appears behing him and honks, and he makes a big splash. It then starts raining in the swimming pool, but then stops]
[Scene cuts to Gumball's vision]
Gumball: [Coughs, sputters] So, how graceful was that?
Darwin: Dude, you can't swim.
Gumball: [Coughs] Fair point. Uh... has anyone seen my trunks?
[Scene cuts to the changing room]
Tobias​​: Yeaaah!
Banana Joe: Touchdown!
Tobias​​: All right!
Banana Joe: Slam-dunk!
Banana Joe and Tobias​​​​​​​​​: Yeeaaaahh!
Gumball: Uh, hey, guys. Is this the Football Club?
Banana Joe and Tobias​​​​​​​​​: Yeeaaahh!
Gumball: Well, uh, did I miss the game?
Banana Joe: No, it's going on right out there.
Gumball: Why aren't you playing?
Banana Joe and Tobias​​​​​​​​​: 'Cause we're the reserve team!
Gumball: Cool. So, can I join?
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: I don't know. Are you man enough?
Gumball: [Scoffs] Me? I'm at least 50% man.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: Well, in that case, here's your towel.
Gumball: Thanks. So... do you guys ever get to play?
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: Nah, we just hang out here and act kinda sporty.
Gumball: You guys just take showers, hang around in towels, and high-five each other?
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: Heh! There's a little bit more to it than that.
Banana Joe: [Laughs and hits Gumball with his skin]
Gumball: Ah! Ow! Okay! Ow! Okay, okay!
[They all begin hitting each other and laughing, Hector comes in wearing his towel]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: Hey, Hector, is the game over?
Hector: Yeah. We lost. [Begins swinging his gigantic towel]
Banana Joe and Tobias​​​​​​​​​: Oh.
Gumball: What?
[Hector hits them with his towel and they all scream. Gumball walks in pain as he attempts to enter the Tragedy Club room, but the door is quickly locked and the curtain is closed]
Gumball: Oh, why doesn't anyone want me in their club? It can't have anything to do with me -- my talent, my intelligence, or my general awesomeness. [Furious] You know what? Too bad for you jealous people, 'cause I'm starting my own club, and you are not invited!
Gumball's Club of Gumball
Gumball: Okay, I'd like to welcome everyone to "Gumball's Club of Gumball." First order of business: attendance. Hmm. Pretty good. Now, it seems like lately we've been let down by certain... family members. So I propose a little exercise in trust. Okay, don't worry, Gumball. Just close your eyes, let yourself fall back, and someone will catch you. [Puts off the glasses and runs on the other side of the room] Well, I'm a bit scared, Gumball. [Runs back and puts on the glasses] Well, that's why it's called a trust exercise. Come on, dude. [Puts off the glasses and runs forth] Mm... Okay. [Inhales, and falls backwards, naturally slamming against the floor. He groans in pain, then sighs] All in favor of disbanding the club say, "aye." [Raises hand] Aye. Motion carried.
Rejects' Greetings
[Scene cuts to Gumball wandering along the school corridor]
Gumball: Aw, man, I'm such a reject. I wish there was a club for people like me that no one liked. I'd join that club in a second. I wouldn't even care what it was about.
[The corridor lamps shut down, and a strange noise echoes through the corridor]
Gumball: Uh... what's going on?
Colin: Look no further, fellow loser.
Gumball: What the...?
Colin: We are the unsought, the weird.
Gumball: [Gasps]
Colin: Let me introduce you to...
Gumball: [Whimpers]
Colin: ... The Reject Club! Always accepting new members.
Gumball: [Laughs] Thanks, I'm desperate, but not that desperate.
Colin: No, wait! We really need new members. We're so bored of talking to each other, we've been phoning up the talking clock for conversation. If you want, you could be our president or something. Or-or-or even better, our king! Picture this: Gumball Watterson, king of the rejects!
Felix, Bobert, and Ocho: Eh?
Gumball: [Laughs] What? King of the rejects? Seriously? [Laughs] Thanks for the offer, guys, but it's a "no." King of the rejects. [Walks away]
Felix: He rejected us.
Bobert: And laughed at our loneliness.
Colin: Well, we'll see if he's still too good for us when we've finished with him. To the nerd-mobile!
[The Reject Club walk like vampires, humming the old Batman theme]
Family Discussion
[At the Wattersons']
Gumball: Rejected, even by my own family!
Nicole: Look, honey, you're not a baby anymore. You need to be able to do things on your own.
Richard: Oh, there must have been one club that wanted you.
Darwin: Yeah, The Rejects Club.
Gumball: But I politely declined.
[A brick flies through the window, onto the dining table]
Richard:[Screams] Oh, it's okay. It landed in the vegetables. [The brick falls onto the cake, squishing it] Aaaah! The cake!
Gumball: [Gasps] Look!
Darwin: [Points to the DVD on the brick] There's a DVD tied to it.
The Plan Unfolds
[Scene cuts to the living room]
Colin: [In DVD recording] Greetings, Gumball Watterson, from our secret lair.
Anais: Isn't that just the library?
Richard: Shh! There's more!
Colin: [In DVD recording] So, you think you're too good for us, eh? Well, you'll soon change your mind when we upload your embarrassing school record in a web video hosted by none other than you. [In DVD video recording, pretending to be Gumball] My name is Gumball Watterson and my IQ is smaller than my shoe size. I wore diapers until the age of eleven and once got detention for calling Miss Simian "mum."
Richard: [Screams] He looks just like you!
Colin: [In DVD recording] Our revenge plan is almost complete.
Computer: [In DVD recording] Uploading. Ten minutes until completion.
Colin: [In DVD recording] [Evil laugh] And, cut! How was I? Evil enough?
Gumball: Oh, great, now the nerds are bullying me! I guess you want me to deal with this on my own.
Nicole: No. When someone picks a fight with one of us, they pick a fight with all of us. Everybody, get in the car. We've still got time to stop them.
Richard: But where is their secret hideout?
Anais: It's in the library!
Rush to the School
[The Wattersons rush to the school by car, then they run to the library door. Nicole tries to open it, but it's locked]
Gumball: Noooo! It's locked! My reputation is ruined!
Nicole: No, not yet. Quick! Someone make me angry.
Richard: Uhhh... I taped a wrestling match over our wedding video?
Nicole: Rrrrrrrrgggghhhh! [Pulls the door open and throws it] Go on without me! [Grunts as she kicks and pulls the locker doors open] Unh! I'm out of contro-o-o-o-l!
[Gumball, Darwin, Anais and Richard run along the library, when Felix, dressed as a wizard, appears in their way]
Felix: Thou shalt not pass!
Richard: You've crossed the wrong wizard, young man! I am level 40! Let the battle commence!
[Richard and Felix roll their dice]
Felix: Hurrah! I get the first shot. Meteor sword!
Richard: [Grunts in pain] Eugh! Ah! Ooh! Eh! He's good, but I can't afford to lose. Magic missile!
Felix: Doinggg! Deflected by the Shield of Rampor!
[Richard and Felix roll their dice again]
Richard and Felix: [Gasp] Freeze spell! [Become static]
Richard: Uh! You'll have to go on without me. I'm stuck for the next two turns.
[Gumball, Darwin and Anais pass by]
Gumball: Come on! The computer's just up ahead!
[A robot noise is heard]
Darwin: [Gasps] Watch out!
Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: [Gasp]
[The noise is getting louder]
Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: [Gasp]
[The noise turns out to be from Bobert]
Gumball: [Sighs] Relax. It's only Bobert. I can take him.
Bobert: Initiating combat mode. [Morphs into a giant robot]
Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: [Scream]
Anais: Don't worry, guys. I got this. [Begins sliding her feet on the floor]
Gumball: What are you doing?
Anais: Leave it to me. Just go around him.
Gumball: Are you sure you're gonna be okay? [Runs away with Darwin]
Anais: Don't worry. The power of physics has never failed me yet!
[Bobert slowly steps toward Anais, but Anais zaps him in the leg, causing him to fall unconscious]
Gumball: The computer! This is our chance to stop the upload.
Computer: Thirty seconds to completion.
[Colin appears, holding a ruler]
Darwin: [Gasps] There's a guard!
Colin: [Imitating lightsaber noises]
Darwin: That guy looks pretty dangerous.
Gumball: What are we gonna do?
Darwin: Leave it to me. Come on, punk.
Colin: Huh?
Darwin: Let's dance. [Turns on the jukebox and begins dancing]
Colin: [Gasps] Such grace! The rhythm... must... synchronize!
Gumball: Thanks, buddy. [Looks at the computer]
Computer: Five seconds to completion.
Gumball: Yes! My reputation is safe.
Computer: Four seconds 'til completion.
[Ocho grabs Gumball's head, Gumball screams and attempts to grab the mouse]
Computer: Three seconds. Two seconds. One second 'til completion. Upload complete.
Gumball: Nooooooooooo!
Computer: Sending to all school contacts.
Colin: [In computer video recording, pretending to be Gumball] My name is Gumball Trisha Watterson. That's right, Trisha is my middle name, and I was born without eyebrows and have to draw them on every day. On hot days I smell like pate and teachers are advised not to mention it. Also, I have a glandular problem that causes—
Gumball: Okay! Okay. You win. I'll join your club.
Colin: Are you kidding? Have you seen your school record? We're desperate, but we're not that desperate [Laughs and walks away with the Reject Club]
Gumball: [Sighs] Great. Rejected by The Reject Club!
In the Car
[Scene cuts to the highway]
Gumball: Well, that's my reputation ruined until college.
Anais: No, it isn't. I counter-hacked the main school server and rerouted the e-mail before it got to anyone.
Gumball: [Sighs] Oh, thank you, sis.
Darwin: Don't worry. We'll always be there for you.
Anais: You're part of the Watterson club... Trisha.
Gumball: Yeah, and whose great idea was that?
Richard: What's wrong with it? It's short for "Tristopher."
Nicole: Richard, I thought we agreed on "Christopher."
Richard: Christopher, Tristopher, same thing, right?
Darwin: So, what shall we do with these guys?
[The Reject Club members are shown to be tied up and their mouths are covered with handkerchiefs]
Nicole: Well, I think the responsible thing to do would be to drive them home and tell their parents what they've done.
[The Reject Club shakes their heads in disagreement]
Darwin: No? Then how about we spray you in honey and drop you off in the bear cage at the zoo?
[The Reject Club, again, disagrees to the idea]
Gumball: Okay, maybe you'd prefer to be dropped off naked at the mall?
[The Reject Club considers the idea, then nods their heads]
Gumball: All those in favor, say "aye."
Darwin, Anais, Richard, and Nicole: Aye!
Gumball: Motion carried!
