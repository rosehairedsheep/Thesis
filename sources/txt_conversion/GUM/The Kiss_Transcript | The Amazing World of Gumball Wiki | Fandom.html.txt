Granny Jojo's Arrival
[The episode starts with Richard struggling with some luggage as he goes down the stairs]
Richard: We should... really get an escalator!
Nicole: I told you, I already asked Santa.
Richard: Cool!
Nicole: Now, kids, while we're gone, I want you to do what you Granny Jojo tells you.
Gumball and Anais: Yes, Mom!
Darwin: Yes, Mrs. Mom!
Nicole: Richard, those go in the trunk.
Richard: Huh? What does it look like I'm doing?
Nicole: That's the gas tank!
[Gumball, Darwin and Anais laugh]
Nicole: Stop laughing at your father, he tries very hard. [Checks on Richard again] That's the glove box!
Richard: Sorry!
[Gumball, Darwin and Anais laugh again]
Gumball: Mom, I've been talking it over with Darwin, and I think I'm old enough not to have Granny Jojo kiss me on the cheek anymore.
Nicole: Why don't you want your Granny Jojo to kiss you on the cheek?
Gumball: I'm just not into the whole kissing on the cheek thing.
Nicole: But she's your Granny Jojo.
Gumball: So? Can't we just...shake hands?
Nicole: She's your grandmother and you are going to let her kiss you on the cheek! [Walks out of house] Between that and her TV programs that's all she has left these days...
Darwin: I like getting kissed of the cheek. It makes me feel special!
Anais: He's right, Gumball, it's not the end of the world.
Gumball: Well, if getting kissed on the cheek is so great, how come those two always take off before Granny Jojo arrives?
[Richard struggles with getting the suitcase in the trunk of the car]
Nicole: Hurry, Richard, she'll be here any minute!
Richard: I know, I know!
Nicole: Richard, her bus!
[Richard jumps into the trunk and Nicole drives off. Granny Jojo alights from the bus, scene zooms into her applying lipstick]
Anais: Granny Jojo!
Granny Jojo: Hello, dear. [kisses Anais on the cheek] Get my bags, would ya?
[Anais goes to get them]
Darwin: Granny Jojo!
Granny Jojo: Hello, walking fish. [kisses Darwin on the cheek] Where's the blue one?
[Gumball miserably approaches her]
Gumball: Here I am.
Granny Jojo: Say my name.
Gumball: [Sighs]
Anais: Come on, Gumball, just get it over with.
Gumball: Well, it's easy for you-- [gets kissed on the lips]
[Gumball gasps and his pupils shatter]
Granny Jojo: Hurry up with those bags, Anais; I don't wanna miss the Sheriff McGruff marathon. He's the only man of justice, in a world of deceit.
Darwin: [To Gumball, who is still in shock] See! That wasn't so bad. Gumball? Gumball, are you okay? [Gumball squeaks. Darwin pushes Gumball into the house] Anais?
Anais: [Struggling with the suitcase] Kinda busy here!
Darwin: Something's wrong with Gumball.
Gumball: [In a high-pitched voice] She-she... she kissed me! She kissed me!
Anais: She kisses all of us, get over it! Geez, what's in this thing? Bowling balls? [pushes bag up the stairs]
Darwin: You okay, buddy?
Anais: Aah, look out!
[Bag falls and hits Gumball, showering him with Granny Jojo's garments. Gumball removes her dentures from his mouth, looks at them, and screams]
Granny Jojo: Anais, you be careful with Granny Jojo's bag!
Anais: Yes, Granny Jojo. Darwin, you get me in trouble, take care of Gumball.

Gumball: Oh, thanks.
[Darwin opens the door, the bag flies out and Gumball gets trapped inside it and screams]

Gumball: Darwin?
[He sees Darwin look up from his soup and makes some kissing motions. Gumball screams. The soup turns into a monstrous form and it chases Gumball all the way to his room. Gumball runs up to his room, and notices his door is locked. He tries to open it, but it reveals that the door knob is also trying to kiss him. Gumball screams before puckering up himself. The soup, which is now shaped like Darwin, Anais, and Granny Jojo, approaches him and they are about to kiss him when he wakes up and screams]
Gumball: [Relieved] Aw, man, that was intense.

Anais: Aww, come on, that's the fifth time tonight!
Gumball: What are you doing out there?
Anais: Trying to move the stupid bag!
Darwin: Gumball, maybe you'll never get over that kiss.
Anais: Then you need to fight fire with fire!
