Gumball: Dude, check this out!
[Gumball catapults a pea in the air and gets launched directly into his mouth]
Gumball: That's right, baby!
Darwin: It would've been more impressive if you succeeded the first time.
[Ceiling is shown, covered in peas. All students are annoyed at being covered in them]
Leslie​​​​: Hmph! [Almost trips on the floor]
[Principal brown comes in the cafeteria, dressed in a hip-hop outfit and bling]
Nigel Brown: Swag! Rap music!
Gumball: What the what?!
Nigel Brown: Piercings! YOLO! Hashtag! MP3! Tweets! Selfies! Skinny jeans! L-O-
[Mr. Small smacks Principal Brown with a tray]
Mister Small​​​​: I'm sorry, Principal Brown, but you look like such a jerk that even a granola-crunching pacifist like me had to do something about it.
Nigel Brown: Fair enough.
[Principal brown crawls up to Gumball and Darwin's table]
Darwin: What are you doing, Principal Brown?
Nigel Brown: Well, I thought if I was cool and became your friend, you wouldn't tell anyone.
Gumball: Okay. Well, it's a bit weird, but, yeah, I guess we could be friends if it makes you feel better.
Nigel Brown: That is so refrigerated! You guys are riddled with disease! We should very much be suspended in an exterior environment.
Gumball: Did you mean to tell us that that's cool, we're sick, and we should totally hang out together?
Nigel Brown: For sure! Uh, izzle.
Awkward Camping
[Scene changes to the inside of a tent. Gumball clears his throat and inhales deeply, as if about to say something, but then sighs]
Nigel Brown: So, now we're friends. Do you want to share some girl stories?
[Gumball and Darwin inhale sharply]
Gumball: AWKWARD, AWKWARD, AWKWARD!
Darwin: YEP, YEP, YEP!
Nigel Brown: Okay, I'll go first. I must say, things are going pretty well with me and Miss Simian.
[Gumball and Darwin inhale sharply again]
Nigel Brown: Oh, come now. Just because you're students and I'm your principal, it doesn't mean we can't share a few— AAAND I finally heard myself out loud. Goodbye.
[Principal Brown jumps through the window, trapped inside the tent, leaving only Gumball and Darwin, and crashes off-screen]
Nigel Brown: [Off-screen] It's okay! I landed in a dumpster!
Blackmailing and Blackshaming
[Gumball finds a note in his locker from Principal Brown]
Gumball: [Reading the note] "Please don't tell." Uh, he attached twenty dollars to the note. How cheap does he think we are?
[Another note comes out, then another, until twenty dollar notes are pouring out rapidly. When they stop, Gumball begins to say something, but Darwin cuts him off]
Darwin: No, you can't even remember what he doesn't want us to talk about!
[Gumball sighs, then suddenly Principal Brown’s muffled voice comes from inside a nearby locker]
Nigel Brown: If money isn't enough to stop you revealing I don't have a diploma...
[Gumball opens the locker by snapping his fingers, and Principal Brown gets out]
Nigel Brown: I've got a little dirt of my own. What if this were to go public? [He shows a picture of Gumball in goth clothes and Darwin in 90s clothes]
Gumball: [Sighs] Look Principal Brown, first, that was a phase, and secondly, we've felt ashamed so many times in life that I think we're now incapable of feeling it, as in chemically.
Darwin: The doctor says we've run out of shame-osterone. Let me show you.
[Darwin opens up Gumball's head and takes out various glands from his brains]
Darwin: As you can see, the brain is composed of many sections dedicated to emotion. Here is anger. Here is sadness. This here...
[The gland makes a weird relaxed gesture]
Darwin: We just don't know. And finally, this is the shame gland.
[The camera zooms on the shame gland's wrinkled face]
Darwin: As you can see, It's pretty dried out.
[Principal Brown sighs and walks away]
Gumball: Dude, could you put me back together, please?
Darwin: Sure.
[Darwin puts the glands back together in a messy way and puts Gumball's head back to his body]
Darwin: How's that?
Gumball: [In Danish] Jeg tror der er et eller andet der er sat helt forkert sammen [English: I think there's something that's put together completely wrong]
[Darwin shakes Gumball]
Gumball: Thanks. That's much better.
Nigel Brown: [Over intercom] Gumball and Darwin Watterson, please report to the Principal's office.
Gumball: [Sighs] What does he want now?
Spare Pair of Glasses
[The kids are again in the Principal's office, with a safe next to them]
Nigel Brown: Kids, I think I'm losing my mind.
[Gumball and Darwin both sigh]
Gumball: Finally!
Darwin: Well, at least you realize it's a problem.
Nigel Brown: I looked everywhere. I looked in the drawer. I looked under my desk, behind the bookshelf.
Gumball: Wait, what are we talking about here?
Nigel Brown: My glasses! I can't find my glasses.
Gumball: Uh, you're wearing them.
Nigel Brown: Oh, no, not these... My spare pair. I think they might be in this safe.
[Darwin crawls inside the safe]
Gumball: You keep your spare glasses in a safe?
Darwin: [Muffled] I can't see them!
Nigel Brown: Oh, no, no, no, they're right in the back. Just keep going further in.
[Principal Brown winks at the screen; Gumball looks at the screen and then back at Principal Brown]
Gumball: You're gonna lock us in the safe, aren't you?
Nigel Brown: Uh, would you believe a "no?"
Gumball: Look, Principal Brown, this is ridiculous! If you keep wasting your time on us instead of doing your job, this place is gonna start falling apart!
[Rocky crashes through the ceiling]
Rocky: Oh, sorry.
Gumball: [Sighs] Okay, you really want to do something for us?
Nigel Brown: Anything!
Gumball: Then you'll leave us alone?
Nigel Brown: Of course!
Gumball: Then just take care of the school!
Nigel Brown: Yes, yes, yes, of course. That's it, take care of the school, and all my problems will be solved. Thank you, Watterson! All I have to do is blow this place up!
Gumball: Exactly!
Darwin: All I could find was these. [He holds up a pair of red high-heels]
Gumball: Oh, well, that would explain the sound when he walks. WAIT, DID HE SAY BLOW UP THE SCHOOL?!
Blowing up the School
[Gumball and Darwin start running down the hallway]
Darwin: We need to raise the alarm!
Gumball: Are you crazy?! No one can know about this! There'd be complete panic! We just have to stop him before he blows up the school!
Leslie​​​: Who's gonna blow up the school?!
[Gumball and Darwin stop]
Gumball: [Laughing] No, no, we were just saying how the wind blows up the [Mumbling] Help me out here!
[Darwin kicks Leslie out of the school]
Leslie​​​: [Screams] Whoa!
Gumball: [Sputters] WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR?!
Darwin: You said no one could know, and you winked at me!
Gumball: YEAH, BUT I WAS.... Uh, uh. Never mind. Let's go.
Nigel Brown: Rocky, can I have the keys to the boiler room? I'm gonna blow up the school.
Rocky: Eh, sure.
Nigel Brown: Uh, you'd better run.
Rocky: Oh, it's the little blue one! Sometimes it sticks, so you might need to give it a— PRINCIPAL BROWN'S GONNA BLOW UP THE SCHOOL?!
Gumball: No, no, no, no, no, that's not what he meant! It's [Chuckles] It's not what you... [Chuckling nervously. Looks at Darwin, and gestures his head to Rocky]
[Darwin runs to Rocky, and rapidly punches his stomach multiple times]
Darwin: HI-YAH! HI-YAH! [Shouting indistinctly]
Rocky: Wait a minute. Are you trying to knock me ou— [Faints]
Nigel Brown: If there's no school, then there's nothing to lose!
Coach  Russo: Excuse me, Principal Brown, I—
Nigel Brown: [Walks over Coach] Take the children outside, Coach. I'm gonna blow up the school.
Coach  Russo: [Pulls out hair from Principal Brown off of her tongue.] Uh, wait, blow up what?
Gumball: Okay, okay, enough violence! I'll take care of her. I'm sorry, Coach. [pinches her several times]
Darwin: What's that?
Gumball: I'm trying to pinch a nerve cluster, but it's buried pretty deep.
Darwin: Oh, let me try something. Apparently, it works on cows.
[Darwin pushes Coach. She then moos and falls over]
Nigel Brown: I've got to blow this place up!
Mister Small​​​: Principal Brown is gonna blow up the school?!
Gumball: Mr. Small, we can explain!
Mister Small​​​: Hold on, kids. I need to make a symbolic gesture of protest. HALT IN THE NAME OF LOVE! [Gets run over by Principal Brown]
Nigel Brown: Once this place is gone, my reputation will be safe! Save yourself, Lucy! [Hits the drywall] Ohh! Oh, sorry. I thought that was another drywall. [Hits the drywall again] Ohh! And again. Everyone, evacuate the school!
[Everyone starts screaming. Principal Brown raises the alarm]
Nigel Brown: [Grunting] Now all I have to do is increase the oxygen supply, shut off the carbon dioxide release valve, which should combine with the boiling H2O, kick-start a reaction, which will BLOW UP THE WHOLE SCHOOL!
Gumball: STOP! DON'T DO THIS!
Nigel Brown: SAVE YOURSELVES!
Gumball: YOU MISUNDERSTOOD US! We don't want you to blow up the school!
Nigel Brown: But it's the only solution!
Lucy Simian: Nigel, what is going on?!
Nigel Brown: Wait, it should've blown by now. Oh, yeah, it's because of chemistry that I failed my diploma.
Gumball: Tell them the truth, Principal Brown.
Nigel Brown: [Sighs] I don't have a diploma. Your principal is nothing more than a... a fraud! I should go. But promise me you'll find a new principal to look after this place.
Darwin: But you are our principal.
Gumball: Or at least you were until you started worrying about that stupid diploma.
Lucy Simian: We all lie sometimes. I lied about my age to get this job. I'm not quite the spring chicken you think I am.
Mister Small​​​: Hey, man, I'm not even a U.S citizen!
Coach  Russo: And I'm not a woman! [Everyone looks at her] Who can say she's never lied on her résumé either.
Gumball: Haven't you been doing this job for twenty years? Surely, no one else is more qualified to be our principal than our principal.
Nigel Brown: You know what? You're right. I'm gonna get this place back on track starting right here, right now!
[The whole school explodes, everyone coughs]
Nigel Brown: Oh, yes, sorry, it was mathematics that I failed. [Faints]
