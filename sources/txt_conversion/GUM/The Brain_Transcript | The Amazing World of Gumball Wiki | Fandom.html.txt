Diagnosing Anais
[Episode begins with Anais being examined by the Bandage Doctor at Elmore Hospital]
Bandage Doctor: Okay, let me see.
[The doctor removes the thermometer from Anais' mouth. She appears to be slouching, and both of her eyes are looking at different directions]
Bandage Doctor:A -hundred and ten.
Nicole: A hundred and ten degrees? She's burning up!
Bandage Doctor: No, that's just how much we charge for removing the thermometer. Her temperature is normal. Ninety-eight.
[Nicole sighs in relief]
Bandage Doctor: No, ninety-eight is how much it cost for me to explain that to you.
[Nicole groans and pays the doctor]
Bandage Doctor: Now, follow my finger.
[The doctor moves one of his fingers, and only Anais' right eye follows his finger; he moves his other finger and both of her eyes follow the finger nearest to her eye]
Bandage Doctor: Interesting. How about...
[The doctor hits his fists together and makes it appear that both of the fingers are on his right hand; both of Anais' pupils appear on her left eye; the same thing happens when the doctor does this with his other hand. he then puts both fingers on their separate hands and Anais' eyes return to normal; the doctor then uses a stethoscope to listen to Anais' heart and an irregular beat is heard]
Bandage Doctor: Well, as a medical practitioner, I don't like the sound of this at all. But as a part-time DJ, I'm kind of feeling it. [He starts rapping to the beat] Me and my dogs we keep it a hundred, hundred. Money in the way twenty-twenty focused, skree. Stacks and stacks skrilla up to the ceiling, ceiling. Hands in the air, you know the feeling, skree.
Nicole: [Interrupting the doctor] Doctor, please. Can you tell us what's wrong with her?
Bandage Doctor: Yes, allow me to demonstrate. Could one of you do something stupid?
[A phone starts ringing]
Richard: I got it! [Grabs a defibrillator paddle and brings it to his ear, electrocuting himself]
[Anais groans and raises her hand to facepalm, but the doctor swiftly grabs it to stop her]
Bandage Doctor: Just as I suspected. Your daughter's been facepalming at your stupidity for so long it's becoming dangerous. Take a look at this X-ray.
[The Doctor shows an X-ray of Anais' brain, revealing a hand imprint on her brain; the other Wattersons gasp and the doctor pulls down a chart. Five brains with different sizes can be seen on it]
Bandage Doctor: There will be serious consequences for her brain if she facepalms again. [Takes a telescopic presentation pointer and extends it by pulling on it, using it to point at the brain at the very top- the biggest brain on the chart] Let's assume this is a standard Watterson brain. If the facepalming continues, in six months, she'll go from a [Points to the largest brain on the chart again] Nicole to a Gumball. [Points to a brain smaller to the one above] In nine months, she'll be a Darwin. [Points to the next smallest brain] By twelve months, she'll have the intelligence of an amoeba. [Points to a smaller brain]. And at eighteen months, she'll have gone full Richard. [Skips the other smaller brains and points to the smallest brain that could not be seen earlier that is on the wall below the chart]
Richard: [Places hands on the sides of his face] Oh no! Richard am sad!
Nicole: What should we do Doctor?
Bandage Doctor: [Compresses the pointer and keeps it] I'm afraid there's only one cure. Anais cannot be exposed to any form of stupidity for an entire week.
Gumball: [Gasps] NINE WHOLE DAYS?!
Two Cheeseburgers, Please
[The Wattersons are leaving the hospital parking garage]
Richard: It's gonna be pretty hard not to mess up, even with her wearing noise-cancelling headphones. I mean, dumbness kind of runs in our family. [Shows a chain] Just look at the Watterson coat of arms.
Gumball: What does that Latin stuff mean?
Nicole: "Insert Family Motto Here."
Milk Guy: Yeah, okay guys, can you just get on with it?
Richard: Oh yeah, sorry. Five milkshakes and a double- [hesitates] triple cheeseburger.
[Camera zooms out revealing a parking lot entrance]
Milk Guy: For the fifth time, sir, this is a hospital parking lot, there's no food here.
Richard: What about those mints?
[The Milk Guy throws the mints at Richard]
Richard: You forgot the napkins.
[The Milk Guy throws a pen at Richard. He gets increasingly angry each time he throws another object]
Richard: No, more to the left.
[The Milk Guy throws a notepad at Richard]
Richard: Almost there.
[The Milk Guy throws a stapler at Richard]
Richard: Little bit further.
[The Milk Guy throws a tissue box at Richard]
Richard: There you go. Thank you.
Nicole: I think I'm gonna put these noise-cancelling headphones right here. [places the headphones covering Richard’s mouth]
Richard: [Mumbles something through the headphones]
[Principal Brown and Miss Simian drive behind the Wattersons as they leave the parking lot]
Nigel Brown: Two cheeseburgers please, and hold the pickle.
[The Milk Guy explodes in rage, filling the inside of the guardhouse with milk. Principal Brown and Miss Simian stare in shock]
[The scene goes to the Watterson´s house]
Nicole: She's asleep.
Gumball: Good, then that is probably the time we drain ourselves.
Nicole: What do you mean?
Gumball: Well, I feel like a giant udder of stupidity, bloating and bursting waiting for someone, anyone to milk me.
Nicole: I agree with Gumball. But on the content rather than the form. You might as well be at your most facepalmy while she is not here to witness it.
[All nod. A montage starts where Richard gets his whole head tattoed, Gumball starts eating a corn stuck into a power drill that begins to roll the his head. After that, Richard drives his car that has tied the cable with motor oil of a gas station. Seconds after, something explodes in the distance, the fire is approaching and the car explodes off-camera. The scene changes to Gumball riding a skateboard, but Darwin also comes with his bicycle that is tied to a ramp that makes Gumball fly vertically off-screen. When Darwin returns to see what happened, Gumball falls on him. Gumball then gets hit by the skateboard and gets knocked out. Later, Richard is in the gym is seen on a treadmill, but the camera then zooms out to show that he is sitting in an electric scooter while eating chips. Harold and Tony stare at him while they use their treadmills. Darwin attaches his bike to a pole and locks the chain. Later, Sal Left Thumb sees this, runs to it when Darwin leaves and simply takes the chain off the pole, cycling away. Darwin hears the noise and stops for a moment but then shrugs and continues walking. Richard is in the supermarket and is at the digital cashier]
Digital Cashier: Please place your items in the ba-a-gg-iii-ng arrr-e-aa. [The screen glitches]
[Richard sees it, shrugs and starts waving his shopping bag in the air wildly as all its contents fly everywhere. Larry is walking in the supermarket parking lot and frowns when he discovers the Watterson's car parked over the shopping carts. In the Watterson's kitchen, the electric kettle starts to melt. In the park, Gumball got his head stuck on a slide. As Hank tries to separate the slide from him with an iron cutter, Rosie watches in shock. In the Watterson's kitchen, the toaster is spilling cheese while the Wattersons watch. Richard opens his mouth, watching excitedly but two pieces of toast with cheese on it gets shot onto his face]
Nicole: I think we found something even more infinite than the universe.
Darwin: Your eternal love for us?
Nicole: [Crouches and caresses Darwin] Oh, yes, two things. Your abilities to emotionally manipulate me and all this family's stupidity.
Richard: [Licks the toasts with cheese] It's not stupid if it works.
Nicole: [Angry] I'm going to take Anais to the mall and by the time I get back, I want this house bleached clean! [Storms away]
A Good Dill
[Nicole is in the supermarket and is putting her purchases in the counter. The checkout clerk takes a box of pasta]
Checkout Clerk: Oo, pasta huh? Me gusta, as they say in Italy. [Scans the pasta and shifts it away] Three boxes of cereal, huh? [Using the microphone on the register] Someone call the FBI, we have a ce-real killer over here.
[Nicole blushes in embarrassment]
Checkout Clerk: [Takes out two drums of orange juice] Orange juice? O-range you glad these were on special. [Takes a jar of pickles] Oh, you gotta good “dill” on these pickles. [Grabs a pen and starts hitting it against the jar]
Checkout Clerk: [Singing] I am a dill
And I'm working at the till'
We're supose to call it checkout 
But I'm gonna stick my neck out and say
Till till, till dill, dill and till so dill with it
[Grabs a pickle and dancings] I am a dill', I'm still working at the till'
Earn a dime and earn a nickle with my fickle ickle pickle
[Anais tries to facepalm herself but Nicole stops her]
Say till dill, dill till, dill and till, so dill´with it
[Places the pickle on his nose]
I had a little spill, with my friendly little till
Put you back into the jar with your herby vine-gar
[Places the pickle back in the jar and Nicole gets upset]
Say pickle fickle, jar can, I work and jerk and stand
And bag a dill pickle, dill pickle
D-d-d-d-d-d-deal with it, lady. 
Checkout Clerk: [Stops singing] That will be twenty-five ninety nine.
[Nicole shows him some coupons]
Checkout Clerk: Nope sorry ma'am, your coupons expired today at twelve.
Nicole: Come on, it's twelve o' one!
Checkout Clerk: It's the store policy, not my fault. 
Nicole: Yes it is, you just spent half an hour singing "Don't go bacon my heart" to a pack of ham!
Checkout Clerk: Sorry ma'am, rules are rules.
Nicole: Okay, I'm not getting in a fight with a teenager. Call to your supervisor please. 
Checkout Clerk: [By the microphone on the register] Bobby, to the checkout, that's Bobby to the checkout.
[A little baby dog arrives at the counter]
Bobby: How can Bobby help?
Nicole: What? How can be you in charge? You got to be kidding, literally, I mean, you are so young that I bet you don't know the alphabet yet!
Bobby: Yes I do, A, B, C, D, E, F, G... [Stops and thinks for a moment, frowning] uh...
Checkout Clerk: [Whispering] H...
Bobby: Heh! H, I, J, K, LMNOP. [Smiles at Nicole]
Nicole: Okay, that was pretty sweet, but I would still like to speak to the store manager, please.
[Cuts to the manager walking towards Nicole. He is a milk bottle in a suit and tie in a baby walker]
Nicole: Okay, this really isn't helping.
Store-Manager: [As the manager "speaks", subtitles appear] Well madam, if you wish, I can refer you to the CEO.
[Cuts to a pregnant woman walking to Nicole]
Nicole: Finally, an adult, so about your coupon policy-
CEO: [In the pregnant woman's belly] Sorry madam, but I'll have to refer to my shareholders. Guys, would you mind stepping in? [Nicole is shocked]
[A fat man appears but does nothing]
"Shareholders": [In the fat man's belly] Sure, what seems to be the problem?
[Anais tries to facepalm herself again but Nicole stops her]
Fun-possible
[Nicole and Anais are in the car. The phone of the car starts to ring and Nicole answers it]
Nicole: Hello.
Richard: [By the phone of the car] Hello honey, so yeah, could you help us settle an argument? When you said bleach the house, did you mean it the literal way, or more as a manner of speaking?
Nicole: What have you done? [Looks at the house and gasp. It's completely bleached white]
Richard: [By the phone of the car] I went for the literal approach.
[Nicole looks to the house in shock and she turns the car]
Nicole: [Laughs nervously at Anais]I'm just going to go around the block one more time, honey. [To Richard] It looks like the entrance to paradise. Fix it now!
[In the house, everything is white and Gumball and Darwin are wearing sunglasses. Richard tries to place the phone back, but he can´t see where the phone's base is. After several attempts he succeeds, but the phone falls out after he turns around]
Richard: Kids, your old man's got it all worked out. 
Darwin: We gotta repaint the whole house in the next ten minutes?
Richard: Don't be silly. We've got about two!
Gumball: But that's impossible!
Richard: I think you mean, [Takes out a paint gun] fun-possible. 
[Nicole drives back to the house]
Nicole: What the-?
[Looks at the house. Richard, Gumball and Darwin are playing with their paint guns, painting the house in the process]
A Family Reproach
[Nicole and Anais enter the house. The entire house is painted the same color as before]
Nicole: Hello? [Sniffs the house and see Gumball, Darwin and Richard on the couch smiling nervously with spots of paint all over them] What's that smell?
Richard: [Nervously] Lunch is in the oven. 
Nicole: Right... why don´t you watch a little TV, Anais? [Angrily] While I go check on the lunch.
[In the kitchen, Nicole opens the oven and smells]
Nicole: [Forced smile] Hey guys, can you step in here for a moment?
[Richard, Darwin and Gumball go to the kitchen]
Richard: What is it, honey?
Nicole: Why is it upside down?
[In the oven, the mold with the melted cheese is upside down]
Darwin: It said on the pack to place it in the oven at a hundred and eighty degrees.
Richard: You’ll probably not gonna like dessert either.
Nicole: What is it?
Richard: Creme... [Opens the door of the refrigerator. There are three large baking cups, each containing fire]... very brûlée.
[The living room is then shown, where Anais is watching the tv]
Nicole: [Voice muffled offscreen] What is the matter with you...?!
[On The TV, Phil is on the weather forecast. The medical Red Cross is to him on the screen]
Phil: But tomorrow, there will be high temperatures with a few IV drips of rain. [Then, an sthetoscope appears next to him] Then, things will take a turn for the nurse, so be sure to take intensive care.
Anais: Huh? [Looks to the window]
[A bird is standing on it. It suddenly chirps a few times, each chirp sounding like beeps from a heart monitor. It then takes off, a blue trail appears behind it as it flys a zigzag path similar to the reading of a heart monitor]
Anais: Huh? [Gets off the couch and goes outside to investigate]
[A brightly-colored ice-cream truck drives past the house. It has colorful medical-related cartoon stickers on the side and a giant syringe at the top of the truck. As it drives past, it plays a tune that sounds like something between an ice-cream truck song and an ambulance siren]
[Back in the kitchen]
Nicole: [Angrily] Do you want Anais to end up like the three of you?!
Gumball: What do you mean?
Nicole: [Raises her hand towards her right] Hmm?
[Richard is seen trying to eat one of the flaming baking cups with a spoon. He struggles to put part of the burning fire in his mouth, blowing it, trying to eat it then moving his hand away several times]
Gumball: [Turns back to Nicole and shrugs nervously] Eh.
Nicole: I need everyone to stop acting like they use paint fumes for cologne!
[Gumball and Darwin look behind them as they realize that Anais has disappeared. They turn back with nervous faces]
Gumball: Uh... Mom-
Nicole: No I haven't finished yet! This is about the future of your sister okay? And if you think about it yours as well. I mean, ten years from now Anais may be the only difference between you three being Penn State, or state pen!
Gumball: Look, I-
Nicole: I'm still not finished! [Signs and she stops being angry] If you can't do it for yourselves, at least do it for her. [Raises her hand towards the living room where Anais was]
[Short pause]
Gumball: [Nervous smile] Can I speak now?
Nicole: [Calmly] Yes.
Gumball: She's gone.
[Nicole gasps with a horrified face]
Saving Anais
[Cut to the Wattersons running across a street looking for Anais]
Nicole: It was hard enough protecting her from your stupidity, now we have to protect her from the whole world's?!
[They all stop at a park entrance and look towards the park]
Nicole: [Points] There!
[Anais is seen walking towards a group of the kindergarteners blindfolded and trying to hit a piñata]
Nicole: [Gasps] Piñata! [Grabs Richard’s cheeks] Richard, do something!
Richard: [Determined face] I got this!
[Richard suddenly runs into the park, zooming away from them at an unnatural speed. He then zooms past Anais in a blur and collided with the kindergarteners with a large cloud of smoke]
Richard: [Breaks open the piñata, it’s contents pouring into his mouth] Free candy! [Cheers]
Nicole: Get away from there!
[Suddenly, Anais' vision starts to blur and twist slowly and she hears their voices echo in her head]
Voices: Free candy! Get away from there! [A beeping can be heard. Richard’s mouth is full of medical-related candies] Free candy! -away from there! Free candy! -away from- -Free- -away- -Free- -way- -Freeway-!
[Anais' vision clears and she is suddenly on a freeway filled with moving vehicles. The other Wattersons are on a nearby bridge]
Nicole: Get off the freeway!
Gumball: I got this! [Runs behind them]
Nicole: Nothing stupid okay?!
[Gumball takes out a marker and writes "10!" on an empty stop sign]
Gumball: Ten miles an hour ought to do it!
[Takes the sign and holds it up for the drivers to see. Unfortunately he holds it upside-down, making it read "¡01"].
Drivers: A hundred and one?! [They all step on their accelerators] Whoo-hoo!
[The cars start crashing into each other. The mess of cars advance towards Anais as high speed as she watches. She then bends down and covers her head as one of the cars come flying above her. All the cars have now crashed across the road]
Nicole: [Takes the sign from Gumball] Gumball what is wrong with your sight?! You cause constant destruction!
[They all look down on the Freeway again. Hank, who is driving his truck,notices the wreakage and swerves to avoid it. As the truck flips, giant pills come out from the top, over Anais. As she watches the giant falling pills, all the sounds around her start to drown out and echo again]
Voice: What’s wrong with your sight? -constant destruction! -wrong with your sight? -constant destruction! -sight- -con- -struction- -site- -construction site!
[Her vision clears and Anais is now on a thin metal beam connected to a tall building above a construction site. As she starts to walk to the other end of the beam, the Wattersons run to the base of the building on the ground, and gasp as they look up]
Richard: Ah! I can't look!
[Richard covers his eyes, pushing a lever beside him in the process. This causes rope holding a wooden plank to rise up. As Anais walks off the metal beam, the plank rises up to that level, saving her from falling. As the plank continues to rise, Gumball spots Steve in a crane reading a newspaper]
Gumball: I got this! [Picks up a construction hat and throws it towards Steve]
[The hat manages to hit him. Steve gets knocked out, pushing down the levers in front of him. This causes a suspended red metal beam to hit the plank and turn it the other way round, allowing Anais to enter the building. She then drops into a yellow half-pipe and slides down, the red beam from earlier miraculously moves towards the end of the pipe, saving her from falling. As the beam lowers, it turns at the same time, causing Anais, who is sitting on the beam, to fall downwards, straight into Richard's open arms]
Richard: [Starts to laugh, but the red beam from earlier hits him in the face] Ow! [He gets up again and picks up Anais, who was on him. Everyone laughs]
Nicole: Oh, Anais! [Richard puts her down]
[The Wattersons crowd around her and the camera changes to her point of view]
Gumball: All's well that ends well!
Darwin: Let’s all go home and run a CT scan and another blood test!
[The beeping starts again]
Anais: Uh... huh?
[Nicole smiles. Instead of her teeth, it is a blank white space with a horizontal line going through the center, acting as a heart monitor. Richard is seen wearing a stethoscope]
Anais: [Realization] Oh, my gosh...
[Darwin’s body is now an orange bottle of pills. All the sounds start to echo]
Darwin: Hm?
Anais: None of this is real...
Gumball: [He has one eye] Anais, is everything alright?
[He opens his eye, a bright light shining out of it, covering the whole screen. Still in Anais’ point of view, the background starts to change]
Voices: -all right- -all right- -all right-
[The one bright eye changed to a flashlight, and the surroundings change into the hospital ceiling. Gumball's voice slowly changes into the bandage doctor's, who is holding the flashlight]
Bandage Doctor: -all right. She's going to be all right.
[Anais wakes up with a huge long gasp. She has bandages on her head. her family, relieved, rushes to hug her]
Nicole: Thank goodness you're okay!
Anais: [Feels her bandaged head] What?! What happened?!
[They all suddenly have nervous faces]
Gumball: You know how we weren't supposed to say or do anything stupid for a week?
[Flashbacks to the start of the episode]
Bandage Doctor: Anais cannot be exposed to any form of stupidity for an entire week.
Gumball: [Gasps] NINE WHOLE DAYS?!
[Anais groans and facepalms, falling into the hospital bed she was sitting on. The beeping turned into one continuous long beep. Flashback ends]
Darwin: [Nervously] You've been out of it for thirty-six hours.
Gumball: ...and twelve bedpans.
Anais: [Turns to the Bandage doctor with a horrified face] So what now, Doctor? What's the prognosis?!
Bandage Doctor: [Looks at husband clipboard] Well, the symptoms are regular headaches, stress, facepalming, and an abnormal amount of shouting. [Smirks] It's called family, and I'm afraid there's no cure.
[She turns to her family, confused. They all do a double thumbs up with goofy faces, but one of Richard's thumbs go too far up and pokes his eye without any reaction. Episode ends]
