Go, Wattersons, Go... Away
[The episode starts with an establishing shot of the Wattersons' house. Anais is going through letters with the rest of the family on the couch]
Anais: Bill overdue, final notice, noise complaint, traffic violation, cease and desist, restraining order... Dad? What are we supposed to do with all this?
Richard: Well...
[The scene changes to Richard in a kitchen advertising paper as a product in the style of an infomercial]
Richard: Paper can be used in many creative ways and turned into a lot of interesting things. Like a duck.
[Shows a duck assembled out of paper]
Richard: Or fashion.
[Richard strikes a pose covered in paper]
Richard: Inventions.
[Richard is shown with a hat on containing a roll of paper]
Richard: And other... things.
[Shows what appears to be a papier-mâché volcano; cuts back to the Wattersons' living room]
Nicole: C'mon! There's gotta be at least one good letter!
Gumball: [Picking up letter] Actually, yeah! We've got an invitation!
Anais: Huh?
[Darwin rises out of a pile of envelopes on the couch]
Darwin: We've never had one of those before!
Richard: That's not true! I've been invited to court several times!
Anais: No, it's from the Mayor.
Gumball: He wants us to go to the town hall for a surprise?
Richard: Maybe they'll reveal a statue of me!
Gumball: Why would they be making a statue of you?
Richard: I sit a lot, which makes me a pretty reliable life model. And I'm a great example to people.
Anais: They're more likely to make an example of you.
Darwin: Maybe they cleared up that legal gray area about whether I'm a feral animal or your child.
Nicole: [Patting Darwin's head] Oh, honey. You're the same as all my kids— a combination of both.
Gumball: I guess we'll just have to go and find out!
[The Wattersons are shown standing in the town hall. A crowd is chanting in front of them, but they can't see them because of the darkness.]
Crowd: Go, Wattersons, go! Go, Wattersons, go!
Gumball: [to Anais] I don't want to say I told you so, because I wouldn't be heard over all this cheering. So I'll shout it instead. I TOLD YOU SO!
[Anais flinches and stares angrily at Gumball, who has a smug smile on his face; the Mayor walks on-stage]
Mayor of Elmore: Welcome! Our social services have decided to offer you a new house.
[The crowd cheers]
Anais: Impossible. What's the catch? There's always a catch.
Mayor of Elmore: There's only a few compulsory addition terms, conditions, and hypothecations. Or catches, for short.
Gumball: What do you mean?
Mayor of Elmore: Well, the people of Elmore thought you deserved a brand new house in a brand new state with brand new neighbors [Under breath] who can put up with ya, [Normal] a brand new police force to deal with ya, and a brand new court system to prosecute you.
Nicole: That sounds more like a punishment than a reward.
Mayor of Elmore: No one said it's a reward, they said it's what you deserved.
Nicole: [Sulking] But that's, like, banishing us!
Mayor of Elmore: Think of it more like witness protection. We're just protecting people from witnessing you.
[The crowd continues to cheer; they suddenly get illuminated by overhead lights, it turns out that they are protesting in an angry manner]
Gumball: Kinda feels less encouraging when you can see their faces...
The Fake-Real Wattersons
[The Wattersons are at home. Anais is looking at the crime map.]
Anais: They want us to move to Ohio?! The home state of eight people who became president just so they didn't have to stay living there?!
Nicole: I never realized our neighbors hated us so much. A few rotten tomatoes in the face, sure, a few "No Dogs or Wattersons" signs in store windows, fair enough. The occasional light-hearted arson attack, harsh, but fair. But get rid of us?!
Anais: Let's be honest - we're the only family in town to have somehow committed a crime in every category of misdemeanor.
Richard: [enthusiastically] Go, Wattersons!
Anais: It's not a good thing, Dad!
Richard: If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
Anais: Just look at this crime map. [Shows the crime map to the others.] All of this is us. Public nudity...
[A flashback starts. Felicity and Billy are walking past the pool. They see Richard who only has his swimming trunks on and start screaming. Richard, scared and confused, points to his nipples. Felicity nods. Richard pulls his trunks all the way up to his nipples hoping this will cause Felicity to stop screaming. Doughnut Sheriff comes and pushes him into the pool.]
Anais: [During the flashback] ...wasting nine-one-one resources...
[Coffee Cop is working in his office when the telephone rings.]
Coffee Cop: Nine-one-one dispatch, how can I help?
Darwin: I've got a pain in my chest. It's my heart!
Coffee Cop: For the last time, kid, being heartbroken because elephants can't jump is not a medical emergency.
[He hangs up and we can see Darwin watching elephants on TV and crying.]
Anais: [During the flashback] ...parking violations...
[Nicole is driving Cartax and looking for a parking space in front of the Mall. She gleefully gasps upon seeing one, but Harold then comes and takes it. He jauntily exits his vehicle while Nicole is staring at him. She then growls angrily. A few moments later we see Harold coming back from the Mall, holding bags of groceries. Cartax was now parked where Harold's car used to be, leaving him confused. He looks in the distance and notices his car destroyed in the trash container.]
Anais: [During the flashback] ...vandalism...
[Gumball is at the Modern Art Museum, peeing in a urinal. While whistling, he washes his hands in a sink and dries them using a towel. The zoom then reveals that the urinal, the sink and the towel were parts of various sculptures. He then comes to one of the statues, staring at the floor.]
Gumball: [Talking to the statue and looking at the floor] Hmm, a bit obvious, don't you think? The hand-crafted, effortful creation of each individual porcelain seed queries the modern phenomena of mass production and replication. [Takes a porcelain seed and throws it away. Then he pats the statue on the back.] Am I right? [He goes away as the statue falls down and breaks into pieces. The flashback ends here]
Nicole: You're right. If only people would get to know the real us.
[Anais clears her throat and points at Richard who is trying to eat cheese that is on a mousetrap. He sucks the cheese into his mouth and the mousetrap doesn't activate.]
Richard: Ha! Take that, science! [He points at the mousetrap which then activates and catches his finger. He screams in pain.]
Gumball: I don't think Mom meant the real real us, obviously. More like the Elmogram super-filtered avatar that requires forty-five takes to get it as flattering as possible.
Anais: So, our fake selves, then?
Nicole: Yes! If people could only get to know the fake-real us. Let's show our neighbors how nice we are when we're not being ourselves.
Becoming Model Citizens
[Gumball and Darwin are at Marvin's house, hauling a cabinet across the room]
Marvin: Thank you for your help, but please be careful. If I get a good price for this cabinet, it's hello, two-week luxury cruise.
Darwin: Don't worry, Marvin, I'm sure your cabinet will have a great vacation.
Gumball: Okay, Dad, are you ready on your end?
[Richard, Nicole and Anais are standing outside, holding a sheet to catch the cabinet]
Richard: Got it!
Gumball: [Tilts the cabinet out the window with Darwin] Here it comes.
[Gumball and Darwin push the cabinet trough the wrong window, destroying it. Cut to Nicole and Anais in the car]
Nicole: [Sighs] That was a long detour, but at least that man got to see his grandmother one last time in Nebraska.
Anais: Wait, didn't he say Nevada?
[Nicole and Anais both make shocked faces. Nicole drives the car through the guard rail and goes back the way she and Anais just came. Cut to the school bathroom, Tobias is looking for an open stall, but all of them are occupied. He growls, until Gumball opens his stall door and offers to share the cubicle with Tobias. Tobias stares at Gumball in shock and closes the door. Cut to Mr. Corneille's class]
Moonchild Corneille: Who said the object of art is to give life shape?
Jared: Uhh...
Anais: Psst.
[Anais makes several body motions. Jared then writes on the board]
Moonchild Corneille: That's right, Shakespeare...
[Mr. Corneille notices that Jared's letters are written very strangely, resembling a stick figure. He then notices Anais forming her body into letters to give Jared the answer. Anais returns to normal and sheepishly grins. Mr. Corneille glares at her. Cut to that night, Sal Left Thumb breaks into the Wattersons' house. The lights turn on, and Sal is surprised. He then sees Gumball and Darwin holding their TV towards him. Both of them are making uncanny smiles]
Gumball: Here. Take it.
Sal Left Thumb: [Takes TV] Ooookay...
[As Sal turns to leave, he yells as he sees Nicole in front of him, making the same uncanny face]
Nicole: It came with a two-year warranty.
Sal Left Thumb: Oookay. [Takes receipt from Nicole. Richard then rises up behind him, also with an uncanny smile]
Richard: How about a hug before you go?
[The Wattersons, all still smiling creepily, hug Sal]
Sal Left Thumb: Not okay.
[Scene cuts to a newspaper spinning into focus, with a photo depicting Richard being bitten by a cobra]
Announcer: Local man saves pet cobra from snake charmer's flute!
[Another newspaper spins into focus, this time with a photo of Gumball, in the hospital, giving a thumbs up]
Announcer: Local boy stops school bullying by making himself sole target. His secret? Sock suspenders.
[A third newspaper appears, this one with a photo of Anais holding a ruler near someone's foot]
Announcer: Local girl brings metric system to Elmore! Puts end to people measuring things with their feet!
[A fourth newspaper appears, on its cover is a photo of the Wattersons outside their house]
Announcer: "Watterson family: not as bad as we thought," says person.
[Another newspaper with a picture of Gary being interviewed by Mike appears]
Announcer: "I agree with that person," says another person.
[A final newspaper, this one without any picture, appears]
Announcer: Elmore Times editor fired for obsessive coverage of local family!
[The last newspaper is then pushed downward by Darwin, the background changing to the Wattersons' house]
Darwin: It worked, Mother. Our efforts succeeded. Everybody in the town loves us.
[The Wattersons laugh, until suddenly their bodies begin to jerk and twitch.]
Gumball: What is happening to us!? [Gumball breaks several of his teeth, then screams in horror as his hand grows.]
Nicole: We went too far! We’re...becoming...model citizens! [As she says this, her head shakes and her chest and left arm grow.]
Richard: Ahhh! My leg! My leg! [Richard’s leg stretches and his foot becomes a shoe.]
[Darwin sprouts a dog’s tail and his mouth turns into a dog’s mouth, followed by him howling]
Anais: My face! [Screams]
[Close-up of Anais's mouth twitching and turns into a neater mouth. Back to Nicole, as she is now on the ground with her swollen arm, her head sprouts hair, then it covers up her entire head as it changes color. Then her head tilts up and reveals a new human mother head with a smile while her body is still blue. Outside the Wattersons house, Cartax turns into a fancy car. Back in the house, the Wattersons, now in their human forms, and Darwin, now as a dog, are all staring at each other. Suddenly, the phone rings. Gumball answers the call.]
Gumball: Howdy-doody-yado? [Covers his mouth, turns to the rest of the Wattersons and shrugs] Absoluto-mundo, sir! We'll be with you in two shakes of a widdle-dee. Zoopity-boopity-bye! [Hangs up]
Darwin: What was that?
Gumball: I have no idea. It's like I just washed my mouth out with a choirboy and now it's coming out in dweeb speak.
Darwin: Not that! Who was on the phone?
Gumball: Oh, the Mayor. He wants us to skippity-hop over to his office.
The Mayor's True Colors
[At the city hall, the Wattersons are in the mayor's office. He turns his chair to face them]
Mayor of Elmore: I misjudged you, Wattersons.
Gumball: So, you don't want us to leave anymore.
Mayor of Elmore: No! I want you in my gated community. 
Anais: Is that some kinda euphemism for prison?
Mayor of Elmore: [Laughs] Yes. [Camera pans to a diorama model of a fancy mansion] But all the criminals are on the outside. Everyone wanted you gone because you were, well, being you. Whereas I wanted you out because you were bringing the price of the neighborhood down. That was a problem, you see, when I decided to sell the land to the developers. [Holds a photo of a happy family in front of the Wattersons, then lowers it, showing the Wattersons imitating the pose in the photo] But look at you now, you've become our new poster family.
Gumball: But what about the other neighbors?
Mayor of Elmore: The bank owns their houses. We just have to make it difficult for them to pay.
Nicole: [Talks as the Wattersons imitate another pose] But what'll happen to them?
Mayor of Elmore: Should that worry ya? Well, they didn't really care what was going to happen to you.
Anais: [Talks as the Wattersons imitate a third pose] What if we say no?
Mayor of Elmore: You can't say no... to progress.
Gumball, Darwin, Anais, Nicole, and Richard: [All are seen laying on a couch in another pose] Hmm...
[The Wattersons are sadly driving home. As they do so, they revert back to their original forms]
Darwin: What are we gonna do?
Gumball: I guess either way we lose.
Richard: No. The people of Elmore might be haters, but they're our haters! They're like an old pair of underwear. Sure, there's not much support there, and sure, they sometimes leave us hanging in the wind. But they're something we're familiar with, and I, for one, will not have some big corporation forcing me to change my underwear!
Gumball, Darwin, Anais, and Nicole: Yeah!
Nicole: And also, [Retches]
Darwin: That still doesn't answer my question. What are we gonna do?
Anais: Okay, this is all about house prices, right? If we pulled them up once, we can pull them back down.
Richard: Like a pair of old-
Nicole: [Pats Richard's shoulder] The underwear thing had its moment, honey. But Anais is right.
Gumball: It's like they say; if you truly love something, make it look as ugly as possible to everyone else, so it'll have no choice but to stay with you.
Ruining the City
[A montage begins, accompanied with rock music in the background. Outside of the Tree Librarian's house, Gumball empties a bucket of termites. The termites immediately eat away the house. When the smoke cloud dissipates, the Tree Librarian is then eaten by the termites]
Darwin: Is it me, or are these termites a little more hectic than usual?
[At that moment, Mr. Small hops by, promptly ripping off his shirt and screeching wildly. He then bites Tony, and remains there as Tony runs away]
Gumball: Hmm, that might be all the bath salts* I've been pouring into the water supply. (* "soap suds" in re-runs)
[At the Wilsons' house, Richard buries a canister full of toxic waste. He rings the doorbell and runs away. Harold answers the door]
Harold​​​​​​: What is going on here? [Walks outside, unaware of the buried canister right next to him] Hmm. [Grows a third arm, scratches his chin with it] Nothing here. [Turns around. His face, appearing rather mushed, sprouts on the back of his head] Ah, nevermind. [Goes back inside. The shot pulls back to reveal the toxic waste has mutated him, giving him two extra torsos, each with a new pair of legs]
[Gumball and Darwin are walking down the street, both with smug expressions]
Gumball: You know what the biggest sign of a bad neighborhood is? [Pulls a stone out of his pocket] Broken windows.
[Gumball throws the pebble at a house. He misses, and the pebble bounces of the house and hits him in the knee]
Gumball: Ow!
[Gumball growls and throws the pebble again. He gets the same result, this time with the pebble hitting his head, knocking him down. Gumball gets up, growls again, and angrily tosses the pebble away. He turns to face Darwin]
Gumball: You know what the biggest sign of a bad neighborhood is? Boarded up windows.
Darwin: I thought you said to-
[Darwin shrieks as Gumball throws him at the house. Gumball misses once again, causing Darwin to hit the house. Gumball growls again. Meanwhile, Richard is driving down the street with metal spikes roped to back of Cartax, ruining the pavement. Darwin, in the back seat, sprays a jug of weed slayer out the back window, making all the plant life in the front yard of a nearby house wilt. Anais is then seen outside Elmore Junior High, drawing the shape of several dismembered body parts on the sidewalk. She lays an ax near the drawings and walks away whistling. The scene cuts to Nicole pulling a tire off of a car, and promptly rolling it towards Richard. Richard throws it into a fire made up of several other tires. This causes the sun to cough, Richard's teeth to roll back into his mouth, and a pigeon and Mrs. Jötunheim to fall from the sky. Richard then falls over, and the sun falls down as well. Cut to an alley, where Gumball and Sal Left Thumb's shadows can be seen illuminated on a wall. Gumball is holding a bat as he speaks]
Gumball: We do this the easy way and nobody gets hurt.
Sal Left Thumb: Okay, whatever you say, man! Just be cool, be cool!
Gumball: You know what I want, right?
Sal Left Thumb: Yeah, no problem!
[Cut to Gumball and Sal, Sal hands over a wallet to Gumball]
Gumball: [Slaps wallet out of Sal's hand] No, you goof! [Holds bat towards Sal] I want you to take this bat and go mug people in the neighborhood.
[Sal looks at the bat, then smiles evilly. Gumball is then seen falling to the ground, and appears very beaten up. Sal laughs, takes Gumball's wallet, and runs away. Gumball, still in pain, slowly lifts his arm to give Sal a thumbs up. After this, the Wattersons are seen on the outskirts of Elmore. Near Richard is a bin of gasoline. Nicole lights a match]
Gumball: This is for you, Elmore.
[Nicole drops the match onto a puddle of gasoline that leads back to Elmore. The fire spreads to the city, and causes several explosions]
Elmore is Not for Sale
[The Wattersons are again at the city hall, which appears badly damaged]
Mayor of Elmore: Aww, good job! There's no point in selling the land anymore, you scared away the rich people! Bet you guys feel really big, don't ya? Picking on the poor, defenseless billionaires.
Gumball: Elmore is not for sale! [The rest of the Wattersons nod in agreement]
Mayor of Elmore: Oh, I see. You mean the lesson in all this is that some things are more valuable than money.
Gumball: Exactly.
[The Mayor sits in silence before suddenly laughing]
Mayor of Elmore: What's that even mean?
Nicole: Laugh if you wish.
[The Mayor continues laughing to the point of tears]
Nicole: Alright, that's enough.
[The Mayor still keeps laughing]
Nicole: Okay, you can stop now.
[The Mayor continues to laugh, now laying his head on his desk]
Nicole: Fine! Laugh all you want, but the decent, honest people of this town will thank us for everything we did to save them.
[Cut to Nicole and the rest of the Wattersons in stocks, being pelted with tomatoes. The crowd in front of them once again chants "Go, Wattersons, go!"]
Gumball: Hmm, you'd think they'd be a bit more grateful than this.
