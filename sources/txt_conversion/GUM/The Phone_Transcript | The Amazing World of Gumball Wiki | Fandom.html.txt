Gumball's New Cell Phone
[The episode starts with Gumball hitting various electronics out of his house with a golf club]
Gumball: CAMERA! [A camera flies from the house, landing on the sidewalk across the street] ALARM CLOCK! [Scene cuts to Gumball and Darwin in their living room. Gumball hits an alarm clock with the club, and it also flies outside via an open window] LAPTOP!
Darwin: [Places a laptop in front of Gumball] Are you sure we won't need it anymore?
Gumball: [Dispatches the laptop with another swing] Of course not.
Gary: [Standing on the sidewalk amidst the debris] What is all this-- [The laptop hits his head, knocking him unconscious]
Gumball: [Opening a box on the coffee table] We have everything we need in one state-of-the-art [Grunts] little...package. [Takes out a large brick-like phone]
Darwin: I don't understand what all the fuss is about. We never needed a cell phone before.
Gumball: What are you talking about? [Gazes at phone in wonder] I don't know how we ever managed to live without it. Okay... Where's the camera?
Darwin: [Reading the phone's manual] No camera.
Gumball: Alarm clock?
Darwin: No.
Gumball: Please tell me we have the internet.
Darwin: Dude, I think this manual was printed B.I. Before Internet.
Gumball: [Sighs] I know that one day I'll feel regret about the many things we have lost today. But right now I don't care because... Who's got a phone?
Darwin: [Unenthusiastically] We got a phone.
Gumball: I SAID WHO'S GOT A PHONE?
Darwin: [Unenthusiastically] We. We got a phone.
Gumball: WHOOO! THAT'S RIGHT!
[Gumball puts the phone in his pocket, but it is too heavy and it falls, bringing his pants down as well]
Bus Stop
[Gumball and Darwin are at the bus stop, standing next to Ocho and Bobert. Gumball has the phone taped to the side of his head]
Gumball: Hmm. [Gasps] Dude! I think I know why we haven't received any calls yet!
Darwin: [Starry-eyed] Is it because you look like a dork with your brick phone hands-free headset?
Gumball: [Starry-eyed] Noo... [Normal eyes] it's because no one's got our number.
[Darwin rips off the headset, pulling out Gumball's fur while he inhales deeply and sheds a tear from the pain]
Gumball: Ahh!
Darwin: Hey Ocho, here's our number: Zero, triple one, zero zero triple zero, one one zero one, triple one zero double one, zero double one, double one zero, triple one zero, triple zero!
Bobert: That spells "poop" in binary code.
Gumball: [Whispering to Darwin] What are you doing? Not Ocho!
Ocho: What? Why not me?
Gumball: [Whispers] Hmm, 'cause you're nuts...
Ocho: What was that?!
Gumball: Ah! N-Nothing, it's just that, occasionally, you can get a little...intense?
Ocho: [Getting louder] Oh yeah? Is this intense? [Demonic voice] Is this intense?! [Voice gets deeper] Is this intense?!!
Gumball: [Flinching] No-no-no-no, no! That's a perfectly normal level of intensity.
Ocho: [Happily] That's a relief, I just want to make sure I don't scare anybody. Thanks for the number.
Gumball: [Whispering to Darwin] Dude, be more careful. We can't just go around giving our number to anyone. [Gets on the bus and displays his phone] Hey everybody, we got a cell phone! Who wants our number?
In School Hallway
Gumball: Oh come on come on come on, ring already!
Darwin: Dude, I think you're getting a little too hooked on this phone.
Gumball: Shh! I don't wanna miss a call!
[Phone seemingly vibrates and Gumball answers it]
Gumball: Hello, Gumball speaking. [Sighs] Please be quick, I'm a very busy man. [The vibrating continues] Hello?
[Gumball looks up at Rocky, who is on a ladder drilling into the wall]
Gumball: Hey, keep it down man! I don't wanna miss a call.
Rocky: Okay. [Drills very slowly] Gonna take like three weeks to drill this hole now.
Gumball: I don't care!
[Gumball hears the phone's "ringtone"]
Gumball: [Gasps] Shh! Hello, Gumball speaking. Please be quick I'm a ver--
[Notices that the phone is not ringing, Darwin points off-screen. Gumball walks over to Teri, who is playing the xylophone. Gumball grabs her mallets, snaps them in half, and exits the room; Darwin opens his mouth, about to say something]
Gumball: [Interrupting] I'm not addicted! [School bell rings] Hello?! [Gives phone to Darwin in frustration] Just take it. I don't wanna see it anymore.
Darwin: [Phone rings for real] Hello! Oh hey, hows it going? What? [Gumball stares at Darwin with an angry expression] Uh, hold on. [To Gumball] Do you mind? This is for me! [Opens a locker door between him and Gumball] Sorry what? Oh, nobody important. No I don't think you're nuts dude. [Walks away, his voice fading] But maybe blowing up the cafeteria was a little over the top.
Gumball: [Gumball pushes his face through the locker vents, and his facial features drop to the floor] I never liked that stupid phone anyway.
Hardcore Gaming
[At the Watterson house, Gumball and Darwin are playing a video game together.]
Gumball: This is the moment of truth my friend. Final level, one life left. It is time for the combo breaker. Three, Two, One!
Gumball and Darwin: C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-Combo breaker! [Phone rings]
Darwin: [Distracted] I should probably get that.
Gumball: Leave it dude! Focus! If we lose here, we'll have to start the whole game again! [Gumball tears up] And I can't go through that!
Darwin: But, what if it's important?
Gumball: [Yells at Darwin] THIS! THIS IS IMPORTANT!
Darwin: Chill out, it'll just take a second.
Gumball: [Darwin reaches for the phone] Darwin no, don't do it man! DARWIN PLEASE DON'T DO THIS TO ME!
Darwin: Just a little second... [Darwin keeps reaching for the phone]
[Gumball starts hitting buttons with his tongue]
Gumball: Darwin, I'm getting a cramp in my tongue.
[Darwin continues to reach, as Gumball mashes the controller with his face. Darwin finally releases the controller and picks up the phone; Gumball loses the game, is in a state of shock and his hair is messed up from his face hitting the controller]
Darwin: [Texting] How do you spell "LOL"?
Gumball: [Angrily] J-E-R-K.
Phone Retrieval
[At school, Gumball tries to close his locker, but cannot as it is stuffed with books. He repeatedly slams the locker with his hand until Darwin approaches him, panicking]
Darwin: O-M-G, O-M-G! U F 2 H-L-P!
Gumball: Dude, text lingo is for phones. We use real words when we talk with our mouths.
Darwin: [Jumps onto Gumball, clinging to his head] It's the phone! I was texting in the library, and Mr. Small confiscated it. You have to get it back!
Gumball: I'm sorry Darwin, but maybe it's for the best.
[Darwin slides off Gumball, curls into a ball, and begins rocking back and forth]
Darwin: O-m-g, o-m-g, o-m-g, o-m-g, o-m-g...
Gumball: Dude, what do you want me to do? I'm a coward. I'm not gonna break school rules.
[Darwin wails loudly]
Gumball: [Reluctantly] Alright.
Darwin: Colon, closed bracket!
Gumball: What's that?
Darwin: [Turns his face into a :) ]
[Outside Mr. Small's office, where Darwin is looking through the window]
Mister Small: [Meditating] Ommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
[Gumball feels around for the phone in a box of confiscated items on Mr. Small's desk]
Darwin: Over there, up a bit, up a bit!
[Gumball mocks Darwin's voice while making a weird face]
Gumball: I know where your phone is, you text maniac! Just chill out for a second.
[Gumball again reaches for Darwin's phone, but he tips the box over and spills all of its contents, including a firecracker; he also tips a jar of thumbtacks and a candle, which ignites the firecracker's fuse.]
Darwin: Gumball, look out, look out!
Gumball: Will you be quiet?
[Gumball continues groping for the phone until he grabs the firecracker, squeals, and throws it at the window; it bounces off and lands at his feet. Gumball tries to put it out by waving his hand, but it does not work so he simply covers his ears.]
Darwin: Gumball, behind you! Behind you- [Faints]
[Gumball sits on the firecracker; it detonates and smoke comes out of his mouth. The phone buzzes, Darwin looks through the window, and Mr. Small hums again. Gumball reaches for the phone, but Mr. Small falls asleep and slams his head into the desk, causing several candles to fall. One of the candles causes the curtain to catch on fire. Gumball tries to fan it out with a folder, but it catches fire as well. Gumball throws the folder away and it spreads the fire to a cabinet.]
Gumball: Oh man, what am I gonna do?
[Gumball sees the fire extinguisher on the wall next to the door, and notices the phone vibrating on the ground nearby, surrounded by thumbtacks. Gumball steps around the tacks and grabs the phone, then makes his way to the extinguisher, but Darwin opens the door in Gumball's face and swipes the phone.]
Darwin: Thanks.
[Darwin closes the door again, shutting Gumball inside. Gumball, dazed from the hit, loses his balance and sits on the thumbtacks. He holds back a squeal, then hears Mr. Small starting to stir. Outside, an oblivious Darwin is texting by the door, which opens as a singed and coughing Gumball comes out with the fire extinguisher. Gumball uses the extinguisher and fills Mr. Small's office with foam. He drops the extinguisher, exhausted, then livid, as he growls at Darwin.]
Mister Small​​​​​​​: [Wakes up and gasps] I've meditated too long! I've become one with the universe!
Addiction
[An animation plays of Darwin emerging from an envelope, opening his mouth, and revealing another envelope containing Darwin; this scene repeats itself, then we see a sweaty Darwin texting in his bedroom, with Gumball sitting on the bed.]
Darwin: [Rapidly texting and murmuring]
Gumball: [Sighs] Darwin, we need to talk.
Darwin: Uhh yeah.
Gumball: You know, I love you man.
Darwin: Uh huh.
Gumball: But... I think you have a problem with that phone!
Darwin: Yeah.
Gumball: So I've arranged for your butt to be surgically grafted onto your face.
Darwin: Yeah, yeah sure great.
Gumball: YOU'RE NOT EVEN LISTENING!
Darwin: Why don't you text me?
[Gumball swipes the phone, and Darwin flips out]
Darwin: AHHH! GIMME THAT! GIMME IT! GIMME IT!
Gumball: Look at what this thing has done to you! Your right fin has worn down to a stump from all that texting! [Darwin checks his fin, and it is indeed worn down] The left side of your head is burning from all that radiation! [Darwin places a fin on his head, and he is scorched] And worst of all, your tail has fallen off!
Darwin: What?! Seriously?! [Tries to examine his tail, then drops to his knees] Nooooooo!
Gumball: No, I just added that for dramatic effect. But you get the point! This has to stop!
[Phone buzzes and Gumball picks it up]
Gumball: I'm sorry, but Darwin isn't available right now, or ever again. Please, get a life, stop texting, and never call again after the beep. BEEEEP! [Hangs up]
Darwin: You're right, Ocho and I are phone-addicts.
Gumball: [Gets nervous] Please don't tell me that was Ocho I just spoke to.
Darwin: Who do you think was calling me all the time?
[Gumball whimpers and bawls softly]
Gumball: [Starts texting] Um, you-you must forgive me, buddy. I'm so sorry about that. We should talk. [Sends message]
Darwin: DUDE DON'T! You had the predictive text on!
Gumball: [Panics and shows Darwin the phone] What did I send?
Darwin: Your mom gave me scurvy. I'm so ready for a fight. You're a dork.
[Gumball cries again, the phone buzzes.]
Darwin: [Reads message] He said "I'm coming." And he spelt that in capitals. Then he put arrow, colon, bracket.
Gumball: What does that mean?
Darwin: [Makes a >:( face]
Gumball: [Grabs Darwin and races to the front door] We need to get out of here!
[The doorbell rings, Gumball shushes Darwin and looks through the mail slot; he sees Ocho]
Gumball: WAH! [Closes the mail slot; the phone buzzes again and Gumball picks it up]
Gumball: [Inhales sharply, and speaks in a strange high-pitched voice] Hollooo!
Ocho: I know you're behind the door!
Gumball: [Still in different voice] No. No door here, bye. [Hangs up]
Gumball: I think we're fine- [They hear a loud crash upstairs]
Gumball and Darwin: AHH!
Ocho Attacks!
[Gumball and Darwin rush outside as Ocho tries to blast them]
Gumball: Dude! Please stop destroying our house!
[Ocho shoots the mailbox, and it disintegrates into small cubes which then disappear. Gumball and Darwin dive for cover behind their car]
Gumball: I didn't mean that stuff about your mom! It was on predictive text!
[Gumball dodges one of Ocho's projectiles]
Gumball: Ahh! What are we gonna do?! He's completely outta control!
Darwin: Let me reason with him! We have a relationship! I just need the phone! I'll...just send him a message!
Gumball: NO! Enough texting! This is what got us here in the first place! We have to go and speak with him directly!
Darwin: Ocho, stop stop, please! Please! Truce! This is me. Your friend. Darw- [Gets hit and blows up]
Gumball: [Horrified] Darwin? [Falls to his knees] Nooooooooooooooooooo!
[Darwin reappears in front of him, and what appears to be a life counter; Darwin has 2 lives left]
Gumball: Nevermind.
Darwin: Dude, we've got three lives!
Gumball: Then let's give him a taste of his own medicine.
[Gumball and Darwin grab trash can lids.]
Gumball: Hey, punk! Game over.
[Gumball and Darwin use the lids to deflect Ocho's projectiles back, managing to hit him]
Gumball: WE GOT HIM!
Darwin: Really?
[Darwin lowers his trash lid, and accidentally reflects a projectile at Gumball, who then disintegrates. Gumball comes back to life, and has 2 lives left.]
Gumball: Nice shooting, noob.
Darwin: It's the trash lid that's defective.
Gumball: Typical. "Blame the controller."
[Gumball and Darwin get blasted while they are arguing, dropping them both to one life.]
Darwin: Does that mean this is our last life?
[Gumball nods]
Gumball and Darwin: RUUUUUN!
[They cross the street and dive for cover behind a fence.]
Darwin: Gumball, we need to call the police!
Gumball: We can't!
Darwin: Why?!
Gumball: I lost the phone!
Darwin: What?! Where?
[Peering over the fence, they spot it on their front lawn]
Darwin: Let me get it!
[Darwin tries to run for the phone, but Gumball drags him back and restrains him.]
Gumball: What are you doing?! This is our last life, and you're gonna waste it on some stupid phone?!
Darwin: You asked for this! [Licks Gumball's foot]
Gumball: Augh! Gross! [Releases his hold, so Darwin breaks free and races for the phone] DARWIN!
[Ocho hits the cell phone]
Gumball: Well, it still looks like a brick to me.
[The cell phone disintegrates into small cubes.]
Darwin: [Enraged, with a deep voice] MY CELL PHONE!
[Darwin grabs Gumball and runs toward the trash lids. He gives one to Gumball and takes the other for himself]
Darwin: Final level! One life left!
Gumball: It is time...for the combo breaker.
[Ocho blasts a projectile; Gumball and Darwin bounce it back and forth between each other using their trash lids]
Gumball and Darwin: C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!
[The projectile picks up extreme speed, then Darwin shoots it at Ocho, but he dodges.]
Ocho's Mom: Ow! Ocho, what are you doing? You're not fighting again, I hope.
Ocho: Oh gosh, did I get a little too intense again?
Gumball: Psh! Nah. Totally normal level of intensity.
Ocho: Are you sure?
Gumball and Darwin: Yeeah.
Ocho: [Gets angrier] Are you sure?!
Gumball: Hoo! Yes. Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah.
Darwin: Yes.
Ocho: [Demonic voice] Are you sure?!!
Gumball: Ye-e-e-es! Please go home now!
Ocho's Mom: Oh, that's good. He can get a little carried away at times. Come on, Ocho! Dinner's ready.
Ocho: See you tomorrow guys!
[Ocho moves towards his mother, and a tractor beam pulls him up.]
Ocho: Can I sit in the front, Mom?
[Ocho's Mom leaves; Gumball and Darwin look at their damaged roof.]
Epilogue
[Up on the roof, Gumball and Darwin are replacing the bricks.]
Darwin: You know, I'm glad I had the strength of character to give up that cell phone. It takes a lot of willpower to overcome your own weaknesses. I hope you find that strength too one day.
[Gumball makes a buzzing noise similar to a phone. Darwin reacts to this by unwittingly hitting himself in the head with a nearby brick and falling backward. Gumball smiles.]
[The episode ends.]
