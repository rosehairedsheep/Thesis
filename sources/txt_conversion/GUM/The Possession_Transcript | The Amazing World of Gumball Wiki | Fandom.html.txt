Richard's Lifelong Friend
[Episode starts at the Watterson house. The doorbell rings and Nicole answers]
Nicole: Oh, Joanna, we weren't expecting-
Granny Jojo: [Drops her bag into Nicole's hands and thoughtlessly walks in] So anyway, Louie's sister Sheila just turns up out of the blue, waltzing and leaving her stuff all over the place, [takes Darwin's food] and eating our food without even asking! [drinks all of Darwin's water] I hate when people intrude like that, but I guess some people just can't read the signals!
Nicole: No, they can't. [slams door] So, you planning on staying long?
Granny Jojo: Only a couple of weeks. The mattresses are hard and the food's overcooked. [shoves away Darwin's food] Where's Richard?
Gumball: He's in the kitchen. Mom told him to get rid of the refrigerator because it's broken.
[Richard, in the kitchen, sobs and hugs the fridge. It rumbles, and he comforts it]
Richard: [stroking the fridge] Shhhhh.
Gumball: But then he got upset 'cause it's his favorite possession.
Darwin: So he chained himself to it and swallowed the key.
Anais: But it was the key to the shed so Mom unchained him.
Gumball: So, he chained himself to it again and swallowed the key.
Darwin: But, it was the key to the back gate so Mom unchained him.
Anais: Then he chained himself to it again and swallowed the key.
Gumball: But it was still the wrong key so Mom unchained him.
Darwin: And now we don't know what the key he swallowed is for.
[Richard hiccups and the car is heard parking]
Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: Oh, Mom's car.
Granny Jojo: I gave you that refrigerator as a housewarming present!
Nicole: You gave it to us because it was the only way to get Richard to move out of your house!
Richard: [appears behind everyone] We are not getting rid of it! It's got too many good memories! [wells up with tears and caresses the fridge] It's been there for me so many times!
[Flashback to a young Richard opening and closing the fridge repeatedly in wonderment]
Richard: [voice-over] It was there when I was a little kid and the world was new and amazing!
[Another flashback to teenage Richard opening the fridge to find a can of regular soda and one of lite soda]
Richard: [voice-over] During those difficult years, when you're trying to work out who you are as a person!
[Teenage Richard gladly picks the regular soda. Third flashback to young adult Richard and Nicole. He opens the fridge and takes out a small black box]
Richard: [voice-over] It was there on one of the most momentous days of my life! [Richard holds out the box to Nicole. She beams with joy, until he opens it and takes out an onion ring] The day I found an onion ring in the back of it. [He eats the onion ring. Nicole groans and slams the fridge door]
[Next, an imagine spot of Richard fighting robots in a post-apocalyptic setting]
Richard: [voice-over] And it was there at the battle of the future of Planet Earth when the robots rose up against us! [Richard, dressed like a post-apocalyptic soldier, takes a bucket of chicken wings from the fridge. He eats one and throws the bone at the robots. End of flashbacks]
Nicole: Come on, you know that last one didn't happen!
Granny Jojo: Don't you listen to her, honey. If you don't want a new one, we'll get it repaired. I still have the warranty.
Nicole: WHAT?! You're taking his side?
Granny Jojo: Oh, I'm sure you'd love to replace all the old, reliable things Richard holds dear to him, but it ain't gonna happen.
Nicole: It's old, it smells, I'm sure it's leaked everywhere, and I want it out of my house!!
Gumball: Are we....still talking about the refrigerator here?
Richard: Ugghh! Okay, we'll get rid of it! On one condition: you two promise to try to get along!
Nicole: Oh, all right. I'll drive her back to where she bought it and see if we can get a refund.
Richard: Deal! [nervously] But that just might have to wait until tomorrow morning.
Nicole: Why?
[He hiccups again, and the car unparks]
Ditching the Fridge
[The next day, Nicole and Granny Jojo are driving. Jojo opens the window, but Nicole angrily closes it]
Granny Jojo: [opens window again] It's too warm!
Nicole: [closes window] It's too cold.
Granny Jojo: [opens window] I need fresh air!
Nicole: [closes window] Move to Switzerland.
Granny Jojo: [opens window] My doctor says I shouldn't look through glass!
Nicole: [closes window] You're wearing glasses.
[She sniffs, gags, and opens the window.] Actually, I will open the windows. Your breath smells like soup.
[In the Watterson driveway, Richard cries as he fastens the fridge to the top of the car and gives it a kiss. Gumball, Darwin, and Anais watch]
Richard: Goodbye.
Darwin: It's okay to be sad, Mr. Dad. It's perfectly normal.
Gumball: Dude, the only place dad's behavior might seem normal has people wailing and bouncing off cushioned walls.
Darwin: You mean a kid's inflatable castle?
Gumball: No. No, I don't.
Anais: You know what, Dad? You should think about upcycling!
Richard: Exercising is the last thing on my mind.
Anais: No, upcycling is when you give old stuff a new purpose. Like our satellite dish! It used to be an old toilet seat. And you'd never know our mailbox used to be be a car battery!
Darwin: Oh, yeah! And like how our trash bin is the old trash bin from next door!
Anais: No, that was just stealing.
[The kids get into the car and drive away. Gary walks up to the house, whistling. When he reaches into the car battery mailbox, it shocks him and he faints]
[Cut to the four in the woods]
Gumball: But officer, we were just releasing it into the wild to give it a better life!
Darwin: It's called upcycling!
[Zoom out to show they are talking to the Doughnut Sheriff and Mr. Small, and the fridge was discarded next to a tree]
Donut Sheriff: No, it's called illegal dumping, and I'll give you a ticket if you don't get it out of here! [They load it back onto the car, Doughnut Sheriff smiles in relief] Eh, thanks for the tip-off, Steve. [salutes to Mr. Small and gets back into his car]
Mister Small​​​​​: You saved this beauty spot! I mean, look at this tree. Untouched for generations!
Donut Sheriff: No problem! Lucky I was in the vicinity. [He puts the car into reverse and starts driving, but hits the tree full-on. A squirrel growls at him, and Mr. Small goes pale in shock] I was never here.
Mister Small​​​​​: But you just-
Donut Sheriff: Ugh. Try to give me an out, buddy. [Gets out of the car and tases Mr. Small. Shot of the forest as he screams and some birds fly away]
The Fridge's New Job
[Meanwhile, Richard and the kids leave a casting agency]
Richard: Ugh. This is the last one.
Darwin: How could every casting agent in town turn it down? I mean, look at how versatile it is! [holds up a stack of photos of the fridge] Happy! [flips to an identical photo] Sad. [flips to another identical photo] Introspective. [flips to another identical photo] Vengeful! [flips to another identical photo] Cheeky!
Anais: Ah! What do people do if they can't get work as an actor?
Gumball: Voice actor?
Anais: No.
Gumball: Teacher?
Anais: No.
Gumball: Puppeteer?
Anais: No.
Gumball: Children's book author?
Anais: No.
Gumball: Agent?
Anais: No.
Gumball: PA?
Anais: No.
Gumball: Waiter? Barista? Mime artist?
Anais: No, no, no! [pinches bridge of her nose] Circus! They join the circus!
[Richard is at the Elmore Circus, talking with the egg ringmaster]
Egg Ringmaster: Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! I've never heard anything so preposterous!
Richard: I know, it sounds weird 'cause it's a refrigerator.
Egg Ringmaster: No-ho-ho! Because we've already got one! [A blue fridge inside of a cage with a sign reading "The Amazing Fridge" is shown.] Some of the towns we go to? [whispers] They go wild for it.
[Meanwhile, at the mall parking garage]
Nicole: Well, according to your warranty, this is where the store should be. [Next to them is the Awesome Store] But it's not.
Granny Jojo: Well, like I said to Richard on your wedding day, you sure about that, honey?
[She knocks on the door. The van shopkeeper answers]
Van shopkeeper: Ah, my best customer.
Nicole: Ugh, what is it with this family and buying knockoff stuff from a truck?
Granny Jojo: [holds out warranty] We want our refrigerator repaired.
Van shopkeeper: Huh, that old thing's still goin'?
Nicole: Yeah, she is. And she thinks your lifetime warranty still means something.
The "Upcycling"
[Meanwhile, at the Reuse & Recycling Center, Richard is with the Guru]
Recycling Center Guru: No, no, no, of course not. Here at the Reuse & Recycling Center, we don't melt down or destroy your once-treasured possessions. We know how much they've meant to you. [Hexagon Lady and Hank, both in lab coats, carry appliances in wheelchairs and stretchers. Hank gently pats a washing machine and smiles to Richard] We take good care of them until we can find them a new home. [Cowboy wheels the fridge into the building.] You've made the right choice. You won't regret it. [Goes into the building and closes the door]
Richard: Aah! Wait! I never said goodbye!
[He opens the doors, only to find that his fridge and a washing machine have been put in a boxing ring, surrounded by a chanting crowd]
Blue Lizard: [strokes the washing machine] Ha-ha-ha! That face ain't gonna look so perfect much longer!
John: [smiles at the fridge] Hoh! Got us a feisty one! [Licks the fridge, but his tongue gets stuck]
[Richard's eyes widen. Snap cut to him and the kids making a driving getaway with the fridge]
Darwin: Faster, Dad! Faster!
[They are being chased by a makeshift truck made from old appliances, being driven by all the barbarians from the center. One of them plays a flaming saxophone on the top of the vehicle]
Richard: Are they gaining on us?!
Gumball: Yes! One of them's got a saxophone!
Anais: Who throws out a saxophone?!
Richard: Pretty much anyone after 1992! [A bang is heard] What are they doing?!
Gumball: I don't know! [They remove the cords attaching the fridge to the car, one by one] Looks like some kind of lame French circus-y thing!
Anais: Just give them the fridge!
Richard: Nooo!
Gumball: We're never gonna shake 'em off!
[They pass by Betty's house as she leaves out an old fan with the trash. The barbarian truck backs up slowly and the Guru steps out. Calm music plays.]
Recycling Center Guru: We'll take care of that for you, ma'am. We know how much it means to you.
[Back at home, Richard puts the fridge back in its rightful place]
Richard: That's it, we are not getting rid of it, it is staying right here!
[A crazed employee jumps out, laughing maniacally, and grabs the fridge]
Recycling Center Henchman: Hahaha! We got it now, guys! Ha-ha...ha....ha....ugh. [walks out, displeased]
Gumball: Dad, this is getting ridiculous.
Richard: No! It's mine! [Hugs the fridge and cries again]
Recycling Centre Henchman: Uh, sorry mate, is there a bus stop around here? [Pause] Actually, don't worry about it, I'll get a cab.
Anais: Can we just get rid of it?!
Richard: No! I'm keeping it and nothing will separate us!
[Suddenly, the fridge starts to shake. It bursts open, spewing out ice crystals that spread throughout the house. The four get sucked inside while the employee is outside on the phone]
Recycling Center Henchman: Hello? Yeah? Yeah, I just wanna order a cab, please. Sorry, what? Ten minutes? Have you got any nearer? I don't know, I'm in someone else's house tonight! Hang on. [goes outside] Yeah, yeah, I'm part of the blizzard. Yeah, silver face, underpants. [waves] Yeah, yeah, I'm waving! Oh, oh yeah, I can see you. [leaves]
Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: DAD!!
A Fridge Full of Memories
[At the Awesome Store]
Nicole: And it's always making this weird shuddering noise. I'm not keeping food in it 'til it's fixed.
Van shopkeeper: Wait, you've been keeping food in it?
Nicole: Yes....it is, after all, a refrigerator.
Van shopkeeper: You didn't read the warranty, did you?
Granny Jojo: This appliance is for the storage of memories and emotions, and under no circumstances should be used for storing food?
Nicole: Seriously? A refrigerator for emotions? What else have you got, a bookshelf that alphabetizes your dreams?
Van shopkeeper: Eh, we sold out of those last week. But don't worry about that fridge shuddering. Someone would have to use it as a lifelong emotional crutch for anything really bad to happen. [Nicole and Jojo go into shock] But casual usage should be fine.
Nicole: There is nothing casual about the way Richard uses that fridge.
[Cut to the two speeding home]
Nicole: I'm sure Richard got rid of it like I asked him to! Hah! It's gonna be fine, it's gonna be fine-[They pull up to their house, only to find it covered in icicles and surrounded by icy wind]
Granny Jojo: Does it get tiring being wrong all the time?
[They trudge into the house. The floor is covered in a blanket of snow]
Granny Jojo: RICHARD!!
Nicole: KIDS!!
Gumball: MOM! In here! [Nicole and Granny Jojo find the kids under the stairs] The fridge has gone crazy!
Anais: And it swallowed Dad!
Granny Jojo: It's not a fridge! It's a store for emotions!
Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: Huh?
Nicole: She bought it from the Awesome Store.
Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: Ohhhh.
Gumball: Makes sense.
Darwin: Then how do we get him back?!
Nicole: [Grabs a string of sausages and ties it around her waist] I'm going in!
Granny Jojo: I'm not leaving this to you! None of this would have happened if you hadn't threatened to get rid of it! [Ties herself to the sausage string]
Nicole: Then I guess we're both going in!
Granny Jojo: Let's go get Richard.
[They brave their way into the refrigerator. Inside, in the middle of an idyllic snowy clearing, Richard watches his memories replaying in ice crystals all around him]
Nicole: Hoo, I wish I'd worn a jacket.
Granny Jojo: [Forehead-deep in the snow] And I wish I'd worn heels! How are we gonna find him in this?
Nicole: Look!
Granny Jojo: Can't see, can I?
[Nicole lifts her out of the snow. They see a beautiful formation of ice crystals blocking a cavern entrance]
Granny Jojo: Richard! Richard, honey, are you there?
Richard: NO!
Granny Jojo: He's not gonna let us in!
Nicole: Let me try something. [clears throat] PIZZA FOR WATTERSON!!
[The icy doors open and a blinding light comes out. The two go in]
Give It Up, Richard!
[Nicole and Jojo find Richard, in perfect bliss]
Nicole: Honey?
Richard: What are you doing here?
Nicole: I've come to save you!
Granny Jojo: We've come to save you.
Nicole: It was my idea, though.
Richard: Oh, stop arguing and leave me alone! I told you, this fridge...has so many good memories.
Nicole: Yes, but I assumed that was just a turn of phrase! Only in this family could that ever be literal.
Richard: But if it goes, all my memories would go too!
Nicole: Honey, listen to me. It's just an object! You'll still remember all those things without it!
Granny Jojo: No, Richard! Listen to me! You'll always have your memories! You don't need to hang on to possessions!
Nicole: Hang on, wait- we're saying the same thing here!
Nicole and Granny Jojo: Honey, trust us! You don't need the fridge!
Richard: Well...if it's important enough for you guys to agree, then I guess you must be right! [He breaks himself free from the ice. The crystals around him begin to crack] Stand back! I'm gonna jump!
Nicole and Granny Jojo: No! The ice isn't strong enough!
[Richard takes a deep breath and steadies himself against the ice. He takes a leap, and lands safely in front of Nicole and Granny Jojo]
Richard: See? I'm not as heavy as I-[The ice cracks below Richard, and he falls. Fortunately, Nicole and Granny Jojo grab him before he falls away forever]
Nicole: Okay, let's get one thing straight: when both of us give you the same advice-
Granny Jojo: Just take it!
[They pull Richard up. He smiles]
Returning the Fridge
[Richard, Nicole, and Granny Jojo are at the Awesome Store, returning the fridge. Richard, soaking wet, loads the new fridge on top of the car]
Richard: [panting] Thanks for the trade-in!
Van shopkeeper: Anything for my best customers. Oh, and I'm sorry you found it so...traumatic.
Nicole: Oh, no no no, that's a...he's just...defrosting. Now, you're sure this one's just a regular fridge?
Van shopkeeper: Yes.
Granny Jojo: And it won't trap him in a wistful prison of ice and nostalgia?
Van shopkeeper: No.
Richard, Nicole, and Granny Jojo: All right. [They get into the car and drive off]
Van shopkeeper: Oh, wait! There is one thing--oh, they've gone. [Episode ends.]
