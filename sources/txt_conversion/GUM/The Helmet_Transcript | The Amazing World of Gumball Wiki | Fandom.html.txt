"But It Brought You Good Luck"
[The Wattersons are having dinner]
Gumball: You know what? I don't think I'm gonna wear this anymore.
Darwin: Why? I thought it brought you good luck.
Gumball: Yeah, it does, but nothing's fun anymore. See? Watch this.
[Gumball catapults a clump of his food in the air. Through an extremely lucky chain of events, Richard's food gets launched directly into Gumball's mouth. Everyone at the table gasps in awe, except for Gumball, who just looks bored]
Gumball: [Unamazed] Ta-da. Whoop-de-boring-doo.
Darwin: [Shakes flippers] What are you talking about?! That was fin-flapping-tastic!
Gumball: Yeah, a week ago, maybe, but now it's just lame. [Put helmet on the table] I think I'm gonna throw it out.
[Richard lunges towards Gumball and Darwin]
Richard: Don't throw it out! [Becomes teary] I could really use some luck right now. I been trying to get on Win or Don't Win for five months, but they're not returning my calls.
[View changes to Anais and Nicole]
Anais: You're never gonna get onto that show, hat or no hat.
[Camera zooms out, showing the whole family]
Richard: [Gasps] There's a show called "Hat or No Hat?"
Gumball: [While placing helmet onto Richard's head] Look, you want it? You have it.
[Phone rings]
Richard: [Picks up phone] Hello? Would I?! [Gasps] Tomorrow?! Oh, thank you, Win or Don't Win!
[Ends call while Nicole walks towards Richard]
Richard: [Amazed] Wow! This hat IS AMAZING!
Nicole: Okay, guys, as impressive as all this is, let's not get carried away. There's no way a tinfoil hat is responsible for --
[Richard put helmet on Nicole]
Nicole: Richard! What are you -- [Nicole's phone vibrates]
Nicole: [Picks up phone] Hello? Interview? Tomorrow? For a promotion and a pay rise?!
[View changes back to the kids, Anais uses a saucepan and a spoon and makes a dong sound]
Darwin: What was that?
Anais: That was the sound of doom for the Wattersons.
A Bad Day at School
[Scene changes to the school gym where students are jumping over a balance beam using a trampoline, a whistle blown by Mr. Small can be heard too]
Darwin: Do you ever miss your helmet?
Gumball: No. Why?
Darwin: Well, everyone seems to be using it for really cool stuff, like Dad with the TV show and Mom with her job. All you ever did was lame party tricks.
Gumball: It doesn't matter, Darwin. I'm happy to see the back of it. [Whistle sound] Succeeding at everything really took the joy out of life. [Whistle sound]
Gumball: Besides... [Starts running and tries to jump over balance beam] sometimes in life, you make your own luck.
[Gumball faceplants into the balance beam]
Gumball: [Muffled] It's so good to fail again.
[Scene changes to science lab]
Gumball: [While pouring chemicals in a glass container] You see, you take a pinch of success, a dash of failure, you mix it together and that's what makes life int--
[Glass container blows up]
Gumball: See? That wasn't so bad.
Darwin: You just blew up the ant farm.
[Ants escape and start crawling all over Gumball and bite him]
Gumball: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! It's okay. Aah! Life is great, Darwin! [Camera zooms to show ants biting on Gumball's skin] Ah! Ow! Ow! Ow!
[Scene changes to the school cafeteria]
Darwin: So, you're saying you're happy when you fail?
Gumball: Absolutely. It's the struggle that makes a victory sweet. Besides, I still got it.
[Gumball catapults a clump of his food in the air and hits Darwin's eyes, causing him to fall and bump onto Banana Joe. This causes William to fly up and knock Tobias's drink onto Tina and makes her drop her sandwich on the floor]
Anton: [Looks at sandwich] Butter side down, just like poor Uncle Eddie.
Tina: [Sarcastically]  What do you know -- my lunch is on the floor. Hey, who's the funny guy who did that? [Darwin points at Gumball but Gumball pushes his fin down]
[Scene changes to the hallway where Gumball is stuffed into Darwin's mouth]
Gumball: [While in Darwin's mouth] And you know what the best thing about failure is, Darwin?
Darwin: [Muffled] No.
[Darwin spits out Gumball]
Gumball: It's that it builds your sense of humor. [Gumball laughs] Ha ha ha ha ha. [Starts sobbing] Oh, who am I kidding? I'm nothing without my helmet! I want it back! [Changes to a monster voice] I NEED IT!
At Home
[Richard and Nicole are arguing in the kitchen]
Richard: But I need it more, 'cause I need to win the show!
Nicole: Well, I need it to get the promotion, which is more important than a game show.
Richard: But if I win the show, I'll get a speedboat! Think about how great it would be for me!
Nicole: Richard, you'll never use it.
Richard: Nicole, if I win a speedboat, I'm gonna use it.
Nicole: You have to understand, I'm doing this for the greater good. Winning the speedboat would be good for you, but not for the rest of the family.
Richard: [Fakely] Oh... you're right. I'm sorry, Nicole. I-I don't know what came over me.
Nicole: It's okay. Just, where did you hide the helmet?
Richard: [Pulls out a bag] It's in this bag.
[Nicole takes the bag and is about to leave]
Richard: Oh... [Groans] No, wait! [Richard catches up to Nicole and pulls out another bag] Actually, it's in -- it's in this one. I was gonna trick you. I'm sorry. I guess that helmet's got more power over me than I thought.
Nicole: Thanks for being honest, honey. [Grabs the bag and leaves the house]
In the Office
[Scene changes to a company building.]
Paperball: [Off screen] That was an astonishing interview.
[Scene then changes to an office where Nicole's bosses are going to employ her]
Paperball: There's... just one thing. [Laughs] You are aware that if you get the job, you won't be able to wear that papier-mâché helmet, right?
Nicole: [Laughs] Of course. But for the record, it's not papier-mâché. It's tinfoil.
Paperball: Mm, no. I'm pretty sure it's papier-mâché painted gray.
Nicole: [Shocked] What? [Takes off helmet and look at it] Can I switch your TV on?
Paperball: Uh...sure?
[Nicole switches the TV on and the TV is playing Win or Don't Win, with Richard, wearing the real tin foil helmet, as the contestant]
Shooting Star: And he's won the speedboat!
Richard: Yay!
[The audience and the Shooting Star applaud, while Richard does his celebration dance. Nicole then gets angry and starts smashing the TV and trashes the office room, while her bosses are watching]
Nicole: [About to smash the chair] This isn't going to affect my chances, is it?
Paperball: Um, what do you think?
[Nicole then continues to smash the chair]
Back at Home
[Scene changes to the Wattersons' house where Richard, Nicole and Gumball argue on who should have the helmet]
Richard: [Off-screen] It's mine!
Nicole: [Off-screen] No, mine!
Gumball: [Off-screen] Give it back!
[Scene changes to the Wattersons' dining room where Richard, Nicole and Gumball are aruging while Darwin and Anais watch in fear]
Nicole: I lost my job for it!
Richard: It's mine!
[Richard snatches the hat and Nicole and Gumball slams him to the ground]
Richard: But I'm on Hat or No Hat tomorrow!
Nicole: Give...
Richard: It...
Gumball: back!
Anais: Stop it! [All stop and look at Anais] Look at what you've become! This stupid hat is driving you crazy!
Gumball: Actually, it's a helmet.
Anais: It's not a helmet or a hat! It's a piece of tinfoil! And it's tearing this family apart! Look at you! You're behaving like animals!
Nicole: [Sigh] Anais is right. That helmet has such a grip on us.
Richard: It's like its magic is taking control of the person who wears it.
Gumball: Ha! Well, since none of you guys want it, I guess I can have it back.
Anais: No! Me and Darwin have been talking, and we've decided it has to be destroyed.
Gumball: What?! You can't destroy it! I'm nothing without it!
Nicole: I'm sorry, honey, but Anais is right.
[Anais walk towards Gumball]
Gumball: Can -- can I have one more go?
Anais: No! [Snatches the helmet out of Gumball's hands]
Gumball: Don't touch it!!
Richard: Hey! [Picks Gumball up]
Gumball: No! No! No! It's mine! Aah! Aah! No! It's my helmet! [Tries to get helmet back]
[Richard and Nicole stop Gumball from taking the helmet, while Gumball goes crazy]
Darwin: Dude, chill out. It's just a bucket with some tinfoil on it.
Gumball: Aaah! Give it back! It's my helmet! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Destroying the Helmet
[Scene slowly fades to the dumping ground]
Darwin: Why can't we just put it in the bin?
Anais: Because they'll just pull it out again. We have to take it to the bin of all bins — the dump.
[Scene changes to show the volcano-like dump]
Darwin: Can't we just rip it up?
Anais: Have you ever tried ripping up tinfoil? Sounds horrible.
Darwin: What are we gonna do with it, then?
Anais: Throw it in the garbage crusher.
[A mysterious figure then stalks Darwin and Anais, while making hissing sounds]
Darwin: [Looks back] Can you hear that?
Anais: What?
Darwin: That noise. Sounds like a cat trying to say "snake."
Figure: [Hissing] Snake...
Anais: It's probably just the wind.
Darwin: Mm. Maybe. I don't know what the big deal with this lucky helmet is, anyway. [Puts helmet on] Looks pretty normal to me.
[Something shines on the ground below Darwin]
Darwin: Oh, look -- a gold ring!
[Something shines on the ground below Darwin again]
Darwin: Oh, look -- a pearly necklace!
[Something shines on the ground below Darwin once again]
Darwin: Wow! A diamond-encrusted chain! And it spells "Darwin"!
[Scene changes to Darwin and Anais climbing up a mountain of trash]
Anais: [Panting] Come on. We're nearly there.
Darwin: [Panting and carrying a ton of jewelries then kneels down] I-I can't do it, Anais. It's -- it's too heavy.
Anais: Well, give me the helmet. I'll deal with it.
Darwin: [Stops Anais] No! It's a man's job. You're — you're just a little girl. The helmet is my burden to carry. You can carry me, though!
[Anais growls]
[Anais then carry Darwin up the mountain while he sits like a king. Scene changes to the garbarge crusher, where the mysterious figure appears again. Anais then lets Darwin down, while his jewelries fall off him]
Anais: [Panting] There. I've done my part. Now you do yours. Throw the stupid thing in the crusher.
Darwin: Okay! [Runs to the garbage crusher with the helmet] Well, good riddance!
[The mysterious figure, which turns out to be Gumball, jumps in]
Anais: Darwin, look out!
Darwin: Huh?
Gumball: [Jumps to Darwin with a raspy voice] Give me my helmet!
Darwin: Aah!
Gumball: The helmet's mine! Give it back to me! Give it!
Darwin: Dude, what's wrong with your voice?
Gumball: I just really need to cough. [Coughs, restoring his normal voice] Better. [Snatches helmet from Darwin] Aha!
Darwin: No!
Gumball: [Laughing evilly]
Anais: Give it up, Gumball! There's two of us! You'll never win!
Gumball: Oh, yeah? [Puts helmet on and laughs evilly] I can already feel its power!
Anais: Well, not for long! Come on, Darwin.
[Darwin and Anais pick trash up from the ground and start throwing at Gumball. All of their attempts fail and Gumball continues to laugh evilly]
Gumball: [Laughing evilly] You'll never hit me! I'm the luckiest man alive! [Laughs evilly]
Anais: It's not luck! It's just we can't throw very well!
Gumball: Then let me make it easy for you. [Steps forward]
Darwin: Come on, Anais! There's no way you can miss him there!
Anais: [Picks up garbage then takes a deep breath and throws it at Gumball, but it hits an oncoming bird instead and falls to the ground] Huh.
Gumball: [Laughs evilly] Nice try, but now it's my turn. Oh, look -- [Points at tennis ball machine] a tennis-ball machine.
Anais: [Scoffs] Good luck finding a power supply for that.
Gumball: [Points at generator] Oh, look -- [Looks at Darwin and Anais] a generator.
Anais: Okay, maybe the hat is magic after all. RUN!!
[Gumball then attacks Darwin and Anais with the tennis ball machine while they run to a shelter to defend themselves. Gumball continues to attack and laugh evilly]
Anais: He's got us cornered! What are we gonna do?!
Darwin: Pass me that stale baguette.
Anais: [Passes baguette to Darwin] Why?
Darwin: Don't you worry about it. Just tell Mom and Dad I love them.
Anais: What? But, Darwin, No!
[Darwin then hits a tennis ball back to Gumball in slow motion, but at the same time gets hit too, dramatically falling to the floor]
Anais: [In slow motion] No!
[Gumball continues to laugh evilly while firing tennis balls. However, the tennis ball Darwin deflected hits the helmet]
Gumball: NO! MY POWER!
Anais: Come on, Darwin! He lost the helmet!
Darwin: [Gets up] Oh, cool!
[The helmet then rolls to the garbage crusher]
Gumball: [Chasing after the helmet] No! No! No, no! NO!! [Falls to the garbage crusher along with the helmet]
Anais: GUMBALL!!!
[Darwin and Anais then gasp while looking at each other, then weep, only to realize Gumball is alive while hanging on a long rusty nail, and still trying to get the helmet stuck on a rusty nail too]
Gumball: [Reaching for the helmet] Almost... got... it.
Anais: What the — what is wrong with you?!
Gumball: My helmet... I can almost reach it.
Anais: Give me your hand!
Gumball: No! I need the power!
[Gumball's shirt then rips off from the rusty nail, but Anais grabs hold of his hand]
Darwin: For goodness' sake, man! It's only a piece of tinfoil!
Gumball: But think of all the stuff we can do with it.
[Gumball then successfully grabs the helmet]
Gumball: Yes! Ha ha! Okay, you can pull me up now.
Anais: Listen, Gumball, [Panting] the helmet is powerful, but it's also evil.
Darwin: Look at what it's done to you and Mom and Dad!
Gumball: But -- but without it, I'm nothing!
Anais: Gumball, we're nothing without you. Now, give me your other hand.
[Gumball then looks at the helmet, then hesitantly throws it away to give Anais his other hand. Darwin and Anais pull Gumball up the cliff]
Darwin: Whoo.
[Gumball then watches the helmet falling into the garbage crusher. However, the helmet drops at the edge of the garbage crusher. Gumball, Darwin and Anais sigh, then start throwing garbage at the helmet until it drops into the garbage crusher. Gumball, Darwin and Anais then celebrate and laugh with glee]
Epilogue
[Scene changes to Richard driving the Wattersons in the speedboat]
Nicole: Richard, are you sure this is a good idea?
Richard: [Laughs] Of course, honey. I said I'd use it, didn't I?
[The scene then shows the speedboat driving along the road, destroying it]
Gumball: Uh, how far away is the sea?
Richard: Oh, about one hundred miles.
