Inside the Bus
[The episode starts on a bus with Miss Simian and her class]
Lucy Simian: Everyone, look at your maps. This is the route we'll be taking to the picnic area. We go along the path, avoiding the Forest of Doom, down the ravine, avoiding the Forest of Doom, along the lake, still avoiding the Forest of Doom, and arrive at the picnic area. Understand?
Students: Yes, Miss Simian.
Darwin: Did she say avoid or go through the Forest of Doom?
Gumball: [Sighs] What would you do without me, Darwin? She said go through the Forest of Doom. Am I right, or am I right, Miss Simian?
Gumball and Darwin: [Looking toward the front of the bus] Huh? They're gone!
Gumball: Don't worry, buddy. Stick with me, and you'll be just fine. We'll get to that picnic area long before they do.
In the Forest of Doom
Darwin: You still got the map, right?
Gumball: Of course. I swallowed it, then memorized it.
Darwin: Oh, okay. Wait...how does that work?
[A tree behind Darwin makes faces and growls at him; Darwin shrugs and walks away as it laughs evilly]
Gumball: Darwin, you know what's important in a situation like this?
Darwin: A map?
Gumball: [Laughs loudly, then sighs] No, teamwork.
Darwin: Oh. I was gonna say that next.
Gumball: Don't worry, buddy. You're part of my team, and I'm a born survivor!
Darwin: I'm glad I'm on your team! Hey, little squirrels! [Walks off]
Squirrel: [Speaking through hisses] They'll never get out of here alive.
Squirrel 2: We'll feed on their carcasses!
The Wind
Gumball: All we have to do to find our way, is to follow nature's clues.
Darwin: What clues?
Gumball: The wind is one clue. Listen.
Wind: You're going the wrong way.
Darwin: What did it tell you?
Gumball: It said we're going the right way! [A can knocks him in the head]
Wind: I said wrong way!
Gumball: Yep! Definitely! This is the way! [Gumball and Darwin trot off]
Wind: Losers.
Darwin: [At a cliff] Oh. I guess the wind is wrong.
Gumball: Don't worry! I shall follow Miss Simian's smell! [He and Darwin begin sniffing] That way. [They find a stinky outhouse] Oh.
Darwin: It kinda smells a bit like her.
Gumball: [Sighs] That's fine. We shall find our way using the stars!
Darwin: But the sun is out.
Gumball: [Sighs] The sun is a star, Darwin. Let's look directly at it! [They look up, then look away, their eyes aflame]
Darwin: [Calmly] There are no words to express the pain that I feel right now.
Gumball: [Calmly] Sure there are. Aaaaaah!
Darwin: Aaaaaah!
Lucy Simian: [To the students] Come on, this way. [Gumball and Darwin run by, screaming]
Darwin: [Lying on the ground after hitting a tree that extinguishes their eyes] Gumball?
Gumball: Hm?
Darwin: Are we lost?
Gumball: [Laughs loudly, then sighs] Yep.
Circles
Darwin: [Cheerfully] So where do we go now?
Gumball: [Sighs] I don't know, dude. I'm no survivor...I'm just useless.
Darwin: But we're still alive. Hungry, cold, and lost, but alive! And we're still a team! I know you can get us out of here. Let's have lunch; you'll feel better. [Pulls out a lunchbox] Fish flakes or diet fish flakes?
Gumball: You're right, buddy! I am a survivor, and I will get us to the picnic!
Darwin: Can I have the diet fish flakes?
Gumball: You don't wanna eat that! [Grabs lunchbox and throws it over his shoulder where it crashes into something] Not when you're in the middle of nature's supermarket.
Darwin: What?
Gumball: [Rolls his eyes and sighs] Look at this tree, Darwin. It's made from little bits...which themselves are made from the smallest bits of all: circles. Circles with other little circles going around. So, since everything is made from circles, then so is food. Which means this rock is exactly the same as a chicken nugget, so let's eat it!
[They bite into it and break their teeth and Gumball sighs]
Darwin: Chicken nuggets taste like rock.
Gumball: Don't worry, dude, there's loads of stuff made of circles. That's why it's called the "circle of life."
Darwin: Oh...is that made of circles too?
[He points at a deer drinking at a lake]
Gumball: Even better than circles! It's made of meat!
Darwin: But we don't have a weapon.
Gumball: Hm...hang on, Darwin, I don't need weapons, I got claws. I am a predator, hear me roar! [Meows] Let's sneak up on him.
Darwin: Uh, Gumball? [Gumball shushes him] I haven't got claws. [Gumball shushes him again] But I got fins! I could fish-slap the beautiful creature. [Gumball shushes him louder]
Gumball: Dude, we are trying to sneak up on it!
[Gumball runs into the animal's behind and Darwin runs into Gumball]
Darwin: Come on, get him!
Gumball: Uh, you first.
Darwin: Okay. [Slaps the animal's behind] Can we eat it now?
[The creature turns to around and shows its deformed face]
Gumball: Whoops! [Laughs nervously as he and Darwin move away] Maybe we should try something smaller.
[They both see a caterpillar and smile at each other]
Darwin: Why are we smiling? [Gumball is about to eat the caterpillar] Gumball, please! Please don't eat it!
Gumball: It's him or us, dude. We gotta eat something.
Darwin: But look at him! He's so cute!
[Gumball looks at the caterpillar, which is crying and pouting]
Gumball: What was I thinking? I'm sorry, little dude. [Sets the caterpillar down] Bye bye! Cherish your freedom!
Darwin: Never abandon your dreams!
Gumball: And have a beautiful life!
[Gumball and Darwin watch in horror and disgust as a bird swoops down and snatches up the caterpillar, then as a bigger monster eats the bird, then as that monster is eaten by another monster, which is eaten by another monster]
Darwin: That was horrible.
Gumball: Well, it's nature's way, Darwin. He was at the bottom of the food chain.
Darwin: Who's at the bottom now?
[The monster notices them and smiles evilly, causing them to run to the top of a tree]
Gumball: I think he's gone. [A loud noise is heard] What was that?
Darwin: It's my tummy.
Gumball: Well, stop it. You're gonna attract another predator!
Darwin: But I'm hungry.
Gumball: Will you please stop talking about food?
Darwin: Okay. [He pauses] I'm cold.
Gumball: [Sighs] Fine, let's make a fire.
[Gumball tries to make a fire by rubbing a stick on a log]
Darwin: Faster!
[Gumball goes faster]
Darwin: Faster!
[Gumball goes faster]
Darwin: Faster!
[Gumball goes faster before screeching and stopping]
Gumball: Useless! It's never gonna work! [His hands catch fire and he begins screaming and running around while crying]
[Gumball tries to put the fire out on his hands, and Darwin stares at the log then a fire starts]
Darwin: Gumball, it worked!
Gumball: Of course it did. I told you I was a born survivor. Good work, team.
Darwin: High five! [They high five and it begins to rain, extinguishing their fire. Darwin and Gumball's stomachs growl] I'm really hungry.
Gumball: Yeah, me too.
[Right next to Gumball and Darwin is the picnic picnic area, where it is not raining]
Lucy Simian: Anyone for a fourth helping?
Banana Joe: I'll have it. [He splits his skin] Oops, I split myself! [Laughs and then falls asleep]
The Team Splits
Gumball: [Stomach growls] Ugh, I'm so hungry! I think I've started to digest myself. And there's no food around here for miles!
Darwin: [Evilly] Oh, yes there is. [Looks at Gumball]
Gumball: What?
[Darwin attacks him, and Gumball screams, scaring some birds out of the tree above them. The sound of Darwin eating something is heard off-screen]
Gumball: What is wrong with you?! You ate all my clothes!
Darwin: Well, maybe you shouldn't have thrown away my lunchbox.
Gumball: Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
Darwin: You wouldn't be naked if I had my lunchbox.
Gumball: Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Darwin: I sure wish I had my lunchbox.
Gumball: [In a high-pitched voice] Ah, lunchbox, lunchbox, lunchbox! [Normal voice] Ah, you just don't get it, do you! You're holding me back! You're on your own! See you later, buddy! You can find your own way to the picnic!
Darwin: But I thought we were a team.
Gumball: I don't need anyone on my team! I am a born survivor! [Slips and falls down a cliff] See? I survived. [Creature growls and scares him, then three creatures advance toward Gumball, who is surrounded] Somebody please help me!
The Team Reconciles
[Darwin appears]
Darwin: Nobody messes with my team! [The monsters laugh] Don't make me hurt you!
Gumball: Dude! What are you doing? [Darwin hits the biggest of the monsters, which then begins to cry]
Darwin: Bad! Bad predator! [The monster runs away] And there's plenty more where that came from!
[The other smaller monsters gasp and leave]
Gumball: You...you came back to save me?
Darwin: Of course! We're a team, remember?
Gumball: I'm sorry I was such a jerk to you before. I guess I was really hungry and cold and...naked.
Darwin: Maybe you shouldn't have thrown away my lunchbox.
Gumball: I know.
Darwin: And swallowed the map.
Gumball: Yeah, sorry.
Darwin: And got us lost.
Gumball: Yeah...
Darwin: And made me chew on a rock.
Gumball: Alright! I said I was sorry! So, still friends?
Darwin: Of course!
[They hug, sighing]
Gumball: Cool, 'cause I twisted my ankle, so you're gonna have to carry me to the picnic area.
[Darwin carries Gumball to the picnic area and the students see them]
Everyone: Eww!
[Cut to Gumball and Darwin who have dried up faces]
Gumball: Look, Darwin, food!
[He points to a full trash can and they both eat out of it]
Leslie​: Miss Simian! Gumball's eating from the trash can! And he's naked.
Lucy Simian: Don't care! Everybody back to the bus! We go along the path, avoiding the Forest of Doom, down the ravine, avoiding the Forest of Doom...
Gumball: That was so good! Huh? [Realizes everybody has left]
Gumball and Darwin: They've gone!
Darwin: Did she say avoid or go through the Forest of Doom?
