At the Swimming Pool
Coach  Russo: Okay. So, Anton has had a heavy meal. But oh no, he decided to go for a swim. Fortunately, his friend Gumball respects the water. He learned how to rescue his friend.
Anton: Hah! [Jumps in the pool]
Coach  Russo: Okay, on my mark.
[She tries to whistle, but repeatedly fails]
Gumball: Oh! [Inhales]
[Gumball (who watches with anxiety as Anton loses air) helps Coach whistle by shoving his own fingers into her mouth. then he pulls them out]
Gumball: Ugh! [Jumps in pool]
[Gumball takes Anton by the arms, but pulls them off]
Gumball: [Underwater] Oh man! [Goes up]
Gumball: What am I supposed to do?!
Coach  Russo: First, you call out for help.
Gumball: [Holding a pool skimmer] Okay. Well, can I get some help here?!
Coach  Russo: No.
[He tries getting Anton with the skimmer. He succeeds, but all that's left of Anton is soggy bread. He splats this down on the ground. The other students scream in horror at Anton's remains]
Coach  Russo: Okay, gently tilt his head using your fingertips.
[Gumball gathers up Anton's remains]
Darwin: What are you doing?! That’s his butt!
Gumball: Well, where’s his face?!
Coach  Russo: Now breathe five times in his mouth, letting his chest fall between breaths.
[Gumball does what Coach says. But since there is no mouth left, he repeatedly hits the soggy bread with his face, much to the horror of the other students]
Coach  Russo: Finally, lock your fingers. Keep your arms straight, and do thirty compressions on his chest.
[Gumball does what Coach says]
Gumball: It’s not working! What shall I do?!
Coach  Russo: First, you call out for help.
Gumball: Aah!
[He cries out in sorrow. The other students start crying for Anton. In the water, one of Anton's shoes floats]
Still Alive
[In the school bus (the next day), Anton is shown reading a book. Gumball looks at him, incredulously]
Gumball: How is this possible? Am I the only one around here amazed that he’s still alive?!
Darwin: He must have a very good immune system.
Gumball: Dude, he was gone!
Darwin: [Shrugs]
Gumball: You know when you’re born, right? Well, he did that, but in reverse.
Darwin: Ew! Who would want to go back to the cabbage patch with all that dirt and slugs and stuff?
Gumball: No dude. He came back to life, and I’m gonna find out how!
[At school, the bell rings. There's a montage of Anton dying over and over again, including having a heart attack, being eaten alive by Tobias, and exploding spontaneously. After being eaten alive by a flock of birds, Gumball and Darwin walk over to his crumbs]
Darwin: Maybe we should just ask him.
Gumball: Uh, maybe you should’ve said that before we iced him fifty times in a row. Let’s go to his house. I need to find out how this works.
[One of the birds spits out Anton's shoe as they walk off]
Making Anton
[They hide behind a bush, and face Anton's house]
Gumball: [Quietly] Okay, let’s see what’s going on in there. [Gumball elongates his eyes, and adjusts them like binoculars] Dude, something’s happening! He’s there! He’s fine again! He’s wearing a mustache! No, wait, he’s wearing lipstick! Oh my gosh. There’s two of him, and they’re kissing! Oh, it’s his parents.
Darwin: Let me see.
[He takes Gumball's Eyes, and uses them as binoculars. Gumball grows new eyes. Anton's Parents twist the knobs until the first knob is diagonal, toast a slice of bread, and a new Anton pops out of the toaster]
Anton: Hi, mom! Hi, dad!
[Gumball and Darwin are amazed, and they are so shocked that their heads explode and their brains fly out]
[Scene cuts back at their house. They are at the kitchen with a toaster]
Gumball: That completely blew my mind! I mean, how does that even work?!
Darwin: There has to be some kind of trick.
Gumball: We have to do exactly what they did!
Darwin: Does that mean I have to wear a mustache and we should, you know...kiss?
Gumball: No. And for the record, I would be the one wearing the mustache.
Darwin: They did something with the dial before Anton came out. [Gumball twists dial as he speaks] I think it was one left, one right, and then four and a half.
[The toaster dings, and a burnt Anton pops out. He looks dead]
Gumball: I think this one is a bit burnt.
Darwin: He deserves a righteous farewell.
Gumball and Darwin: Bye! [They throw the burnt Anton in the trash can]
Gumball: I think we should try three, and a half.
[They twist the dial, and toast another slice. Another Anton pops up]
Gumball and Darwin: Yay!
Ant-Two: [Moves deliriously]
Gumball: Maybe he’s still a bit underdone.
[They toast him again. A perfect replica of Anton comes out]
Gumball and Darwin: Yay! We made Anton!
Darwin: What shall we call him?
Gumball: Hmm. Ant-Two?
Ant-Two: Ant-Two!
Gumball: [Laughs] Amazing! We made a living, breathing clone of our friend!
Darwin: Yeah!
Darwin: After spying on him!
Ant-Two: Spying on him!
Darwin: And now there are two of him! It throws out all sorts of moral issues way beyond our comprehension!
Ant-Two: Moral issues!
Gumball and Darwin: [Laugh]
Darwin: [Scared] Then why do I feel so bad about it?
Gumball: Oh. It’s because we violated the laws of nature, as well as the laws of mankind, without any regard for our friend’s feelings!
Darwin: Huh. [Cheerily] Oh yeah. That’s why.
[They hear the rest of their family arrive. They start unpacking the car]
Gumball and Darwin: What have we done?!
Gumball: We’ve sunk pretty low before, but this has got to be the first time we’ve violated the laws of nature!
Darwin: What do we do with him?!
Gumball: You keep an eye on him and make sure he doesn’t go anywhere! We’ve got to keep him out of the kitchen! I’ll think of a clever distraction. [Moves to run off]
Ant-Two: Clever distraction!
Gumball: [Stops] He’s still half-baked, isn’t he? [Runs off]
Darwin: Okay, buddy, let’s get-uh-
[Ant II is gone. Gumball runs to the porch, and stands at the entrance]
Gumball: Mom, dad, wait!
Nicole: What’s wrong?!
Gumball: Uh, y-y-you left the oven on!
Nicole: What?!
[She and the others run through the door, and to the kitchen. Gumball sighs]
Gumball: Wait!
Nicole: What are you talking about? The oven isn’t on.
Richard: There was food here! [He starts sniffing the air] I see the sun shining on wheat swaying gently in the breeze. [He starts moving around the kitchen] I see fresh spring water babbling in a brook. The yeast raises the bread, lifts it high! A slice white and fresh as milk. But wait, what are you doing? It’s too hot! It’s burning! No, it burns! Agh! You’ve ruined the toast! [He sniffs a scent from the trash can, and follows it. Beads of sweat form on Gumball's head] It’s here! I can still eat it! [He opens the trash can, only to find it empty] Eh, never mind.
Gumball and Darwin's Room
[Gumball enters his room, and sighs in relief]
Gumball: That was close. [Looks at what he thinks is Ant-Two] Why isn’t he repeating anymore? What is wrong with you?
Ant-Three: [Scoffs] What’s wrong with you?
Gumball: Hmm. I can’t tell if he’s repeating, or being sarcastic… [Suspiciously] What are you hiding?!
Darwin: [With arms behind back] Uh, nothing.
Gumball: Show me your hands.
Darwin: [Shows left fin]
Gumball: The other one.
Darwin: [Shows right fin while withdrawing his left]
Gumball: Come on, show me both hands!
Darwin: [Shows both fins while contorting his head/body, until a toaster falls out from behind him. He whimpers]
Gumball:YOU MADE AN ANT-THREE?!
Darwin: I had to! I turned around, and Ant-Two was gone! [Cries] And I knew you would be angry at me and you would do the angry mouth, and I would cry!
Gumball: Okay, this is bad, but it could get way worse. I mean, what if he bumps into the real Anton?
Darwin: Do you think we’re gonna get told off?
Gumball: No, dude. We could get hunted down by the FBI, or tried for crimes against humanity. Or even worse!
Darwin: Even worse?!
Gumball: Yeah. Actually, I started a little too high.
Gumball: Being tried for crimes against humanity is about as bad as it gets.
Darwin: Ah. Good!
Gumball: Dude, that’s still the worst it can get.
Darwin: Aw. [Whimpers]
Gumball: Okay, we need to cover as much of the neighbor as we can.
Darwin: But we can’t ask for help.
Gumball: And we obviously can’t be everywhere at the same time.
[They look at the toaster]
Clone Army
[The Park, nighttime. Gumball speaks to an army of Antons]
Gumball: All right, dudes! This is our target! [Holds up a picture of Anton] If you see him, just pin him down! Okay, ready, steady, go!
[The clones see each other, and start mauling each other. Darwin walks to him]
Gumball: What have you done with your Antons? Did you lose them all again?
Darwin: No. Well, there was a bit of an accident. I told them to split up to cover more ground.
Gumball: So?
Darwin: I think they might’ve taken it too literally.
[A shadowed image of what looks like the clones massacring each other shows up in Darwin's eyes]
Darwin: It was pastrycide!
Gumball: Don’t beat yourself up. There guys are so sweet and obedient that if I told them, “go jump in a lake”, [The clones start jumping into the lake] they wouldn’t even think twice before they- oh, stop! The mission is aborted! We’re going back home!
Antons: [Walk off] Aw!
Gumball: We’re gonna need a place to hide them when we go to school tomorrow.
Antons: [Behind bush] School tomorrow!
School Tomorrow
[The bell rings. Anton walks happily across the school hallway]
Carmen: Hello!
Anton: Hello!
Teri: Oh, hi!
Anton: Oh, hi!
Clayton: Hey!
Anton: Hey!
Gumball: [Tackles Anton] Gotcha! You’re coming with me, Ant-Two!
Anton: Ant who?
Gumball: Aha! I told you he was the clone!
Anton: What clone?
Gumball and Darwin: Uhhhh…
[At the Watterson's house, Richard is fast asleep. Then he wakes up, troubled]
Richard: They’re trapped! They’re being held captive! [Sniffs] They’re close!
[He sniffs a scent that leads him to the shed, and discovers the clone army]
Richard: Don’t worry. You’re safe now… until it’s time to make a sandwich. [Gets hit by shovel]
Ant-One: My name is Ant-One! I was the first! Kneel before me!
[The clones bow before him]
[Back at school, Anton continues watching Gumball and Darwin]
Gumball and Darwin: Uhhhhhhhhhh…
Anton: Uh, actually. You know what? I don’t think I care anymore. [Walks off] See you later, guys!
[Ant-Two is seen at the hallway. Anton heads in his direction]
Gumball: Anton!
Anton: What?
Gumball: Uh, uh... you’re late for class!
Anton: Oh, no! [Runs off in same direction] Thanks, guys!
[He bumps into Ant-Two]
Anton: Huh?! Since when do we have a mirror here?
Ant-Two: A mirror here!
Anton: Oh my gosh. This mirror has an echo!
Ant-Two: Echo!
Anton: Ha ha. I’ll see you guys later. [Walks offscreen]
Gumball: Thank goodness he’s as dumb as the other ones. I thought we were busted and he’d find out about the cloning.
Anton: What cloning?
Gumball: What the- how did you hear me?!
Anton: Dude, just because I’m out of sight doesn’t mean I’m out of earshot. You made a clone of me? How many did you make?!
Gumball: Pshhhh...Not that many.
Anton: How many?!
Ant-Two: How many?!
Gumball: Uh…
Anton: How many?!
Ant-Two: How many?!
[One of them gets sprayed through with a powerful blast of water. Ant I is seen holding the hose]
Ant-One: Enough to have my revenge! There can only be one original, and it’s me!
Bread Battle
Gumball: Quick, come with us, Anton! We’ll protect you! [Picks up the other Anton, and runs off with Darwin]
[Ant-One, and his army charge]
Darwin: What do we do?!
Gumball: There’s only one way to fight an army of Antons! We need a bigger army of Antons!
Darwin: That’s a great idea! [Gumball hits him on the head with "Anton"]
Gumball: Haven’t you learned anything today?!
Darwin: That you mostly have bad ideas?
Gumball: Uh, yes. But more importantly, it’s bad to play with life this way. Unless we get awesome scientific progress from it, I guess. And because of us, our friend is in danger!
Darwin: Hmm! [He stops dead in his tracks]
Gumball: Dude, what are you doing?!
Darwin: Go and protect him! I’ll buy you some time! But tell Anton I’m sorry. I’m sorry for betraying his friendship, and I’m- hey!
[Gumball is revealed to have run off in the middle of Darwin's speech]
Gumball: Sorry, dude, you were speaking for too long! [Runs off into the hallway]
[Darwin faces the Anton army]
Darwin: Well, I might go down, but I won’t go down alone!
[He starts fighting the army. Darwin hits, and kicked several clones. Then he stops, and realizes their ineffectiveness]
Darwin: Dude, you guys are totally useless in a fight. This doesn’t feel fair at all. I’m gonna have to stop.
Ant-One: No! You failed me!
[He pulls the fire alarm, setting off the sprinklers. The clones all scream as they become soggy, melt and die. Darwin watches in terror]
Anton clone: I’m melting!
[Cuts to Richard raising his head up against the sky]
Richard: No! I feel a great disturbance in the food chain as if a thousand sandwiches cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced.
Ant-One Gets Defeated
[Cut back to the hallway, as the sprinklers turn on just as Gumball and "Anton" enter the swimming pool area. Gumball fears for Anton's life]
Gumball: Aah! [Shuts the door] Okay, I think we’ll be safe here.
[Ant-One opens the door with a plastic sandwich bag over his body, which he removes]
Gumball: What’s your problem, man?! Why are you so mean?!
Ant-One: Because once I get rid of him, I’ll become the only Anton! Maybe then you’ll be my friend, father!
Gumball: Messed up! [He climbs the high dive with "Anton" in tow. Ant I gives chase]
Ant-One: Come back, father! Everything will be perfect when it’s just you, me, and mother!
Gumball: Dude, I’m not your dad! I’m just a dude, and Darwin would make a terrible mother ‘cause he’s just a dude. And you’re not the one! This dude is. [Ant-One claws him] Agh!
Ant-One: Then if I can’t be the one, nobody can! [Lunges at "Anton," but misses and clings to Gumball's hand]
Gumball: Agh!
Ant-One: [Despairing] This is the end! We’re too heavy! You’ll have to let us go!
Gumball: Dude, you’re two pieces of toast. I’ve lifted a sandwich before. [Ant-One scratches at his face to get to "Anton," forcing Gumball to let go of him]
[Ant-One falls off the high dive in slow-motion. The scene reverts to normal speed as Ant-One bounces off the low-dive and into the water]
Ant-One: You think you got rid of me?! Well, I’ll be back, and you’ll forever fear my return! I’ll be your every waking thought, your every restless night! I am your worst nightmare!
[He crumbles to bits, and his remains are sucked down a drain]
Darwin: What’d he say?
Gumball: I don’t know, something like- [Gurgling] [Turns to "Anton"] Look man, I’m so sorry for what we’ve done. We played with life and didn’t think of the consequences. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive us and we can still be friends.
Ant-Two: [Revealing himself] Still be friends!
[Gumball and Darwin seem incredibly shocked at the realization]
