I Wanna be Dumb
[Richard, Gumball and Darwin are fooling around, playing "Butt Puppets." They all have their butts on the table, with sunglasses on them; Anais is making puzzles with Nicole at the coffee table]
Gumball: Get off my lawn, Watterson!
Richard: But why, Mr. Robinson?
Darwin: Don't be so cheeky!
[Richard, Gumball and Darwin laugh; Camera cuts to Anais]
Nicole: C'mon sweetie, one puzzle; one thousand pieces of fun.
Anais: Mom, can we do something, you know...not boring?
Nicole: You mean like the two thousand piece puzzle?
Anais: No something more like that.
[Camera turns back to Richard, Darwin and Gumball]
Gumball: I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
[Everyone Laughs]
Richard: Hahahaha, bottom!
Nicole: [Opens puzzle] Anais, I think you are a bit too intelligent for that kind of behavior.
Anais: Well if being intelligent means no fun then I don't want to be intelligent anymore. [Walks away] By the way those go there. [Quickly finishes puzzle]
Nicole: [Pulls out a camera and takes picture] Nice...
[Anais walks up to Gumball]
Anais: Gumball, can I speak to you?
Gumball: [Flicks fingers and points to his bottom] My eyes are up here.
Anais: How come you guys never ask me to play with you.
Gumball: Well, [Cleans glasses] we thought you liked puzzles.
Anais: Yeah, puzzles are okay, but i'd like to join you and be dumb for a change, just for a day.
Gumball: [Scratches butt] For a day, huh...
Richard and Darwin: Hmm...
Darwin: I think we should give her a chance.
Gumball: Okay then.
Anais: Yay!
"I'm the President."
[Gumball, Darwin and Anais are in the garden]
Gumball: Here's a game we like to play. It's called  "I'm the President".
Anais: What are the rules?
Gumball: Well, I'm the president, and you have to do what I say.
Darwin: Yes sir, Mr. President, sir!
Gumball: Now, go get the stinkiest thing you can find in the house.
Darwin: Yes sir, Mr. President, sir!
[Darwin runs away and Gumball raises eyebrow at Anais]
Anais: I'm not doing that!
Gumball: You have to, I'm the President.
Anais: But the...but...Why?
[Darwin comes back with a sock on a stick]
Darwin: Mr. President sir, I found one of Mr. Dad's socks.
Gumball: Is it sweaty?
Darwin: Yes sir, it's crunchy on the outside and moldy on the inside. Just the way you like it, sir!
Gumball: Good job, soldier! This shall be our flag, and in Dumb Land, what's the motto?
Gumball and Darwin: "Dumbus Kissus Flagus!"
[Gumball and Darwin kiss the flag and fall down, gasping]
Anais: This is so dumb.
Darwin: That's the point! [Continues gasping]
Anais: I just don't get it.
[Nicole speaks to Anais from inside the house]
Nicole: Anais, look, honey! Porcupine parade, three thousand pieces!
Anais: [Whispering] Please, teach me.
How to be Dumb
[Back in the Wattersons' house]
Gumball: Okay now, notepad ready?
Anais: Yep.
Gumball: The first rule of dumb is that dumb people don't take notes.
Anais: [Writing down on her notepad] Don't...take...notes.
[Darwin walks up to Anais, grabs her notepad and hands it to Gumball. Gumball checks the notepad, then throws it outside, breaking the window; The notepad lands on Mr. Robinson's windshield while he is driving]
Gaylord: [While driving] Aaaaaah!
[His car crashes into a fire hydrant]
Gaylord: [Screaming angrily] My car!
[Camera cuts back to Watterson's lounge room]
Gumball: Now, if you want to be dumb, you've got to speak dumb. Darwin and me will demonstrate; dumb.
Darwin: Dumb.
Gumball: Dumb dumb dumb.
Darwin: Dumb dumb dumb dumb.
Gumball: Now you try it.
Anais: [Looks confused] Dumb dumb dumb?
[Gumball starts to chuckle and Darwin is shocked]
Anais: What?
Gumball: It's just what you said is really rude.
Darwin: Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
Anais: Well, come on, how do you speak dumb?
Gumball: Here's a little song that might help you.
[Gumball and Darwin coughing for the song]
Gumball and Darwin: [Singing while playing the air guitar] Dumb dumb dumb, dumb dumb dumb, duh duh dumb dumb dumb.
[Gumball raises his hand with a rock sign]
Darwin: [Performing his air guitar solo while singing] Dumb duh duh duh dumb, duma duma duma duma duma dumaner DUM.
[Gumball and Darwin breath of exhaustion]
Anais: Nope, I don't get it.
Knowing How to be Dumb
[Scene changes to the kitchen]
Gumball: Okay, now Anais I want you to make a sandwich but like a dumb person would.
[Gumball and Darwin are staring at Anais, when Anais is squirting mayonnaise on the bread, then Gumball and Darwin chuckles]
Anais: What?
Gumball: Oh, nothing! It's just smart people always struggle with that one.
Anais: How do you do it then?
Gumball: Watch and learn.
[Gumball and Darwin run around the table, then put the bread on the table; They slam their faces into the bread and it sticks to them; Darwin holds a stick of butter, then Gumball grabs some of the butter and puts some on the bread on his face while Darwin throws Swiss cheese into the air; Gumball and Darwin slam the bread on their faces into the Swiss cheese, then the bread comes off their faces and the completed sandwich lands on the table]
Gumball and Darwin: [While clapping] Ha ha ha ha ha.
Anais: [Confused] Nope, I don't get it.
[Scene changes to the backyard]
Gumball: Look, it's not complicated, all you need to do is think dumb, Darwin if you please.
Darwin: [Trying to pop up his head] Huuuuah [Opens up his head, exposing his brain] Take a look.
[Anais takes a look inside Darwin's head, Darwin's brain has 2 eyes and a body; it is tap dancing to some music; Anais still looks confused]
Anais: I'm never going to get this.
[Darwin closes his head]
Gumball: Ah, don't feel bad. It takes years of dedication to think dumb like we do.
Anais: Aw, come on, guys. You guys don't think dumb, you don't think at all. [Anais realizes something and whispers] That's it! [Then back to her normal voice] That's it, you literally don't think at all.
Gumball: Hum humph.
Anais: For example, [Holding a red pepper] most people will think twice about putting a hot chili in their mouth, but because you didn't think even once.
[Gumball is jumping in pain because his mouth is on fire]
Gumball: AHHH! Ohh! AHHHH!
Anais: You've already done it, [Raising her arms up] I finally get it! I know how to be dumb!
Gumball, Darwin and Anais: YAY!!
[The door to the kitchen opens, revealing Richard]
Richard: Anyone want to play fruitball?
Anais: [Jumping] I do! I do!
Richard: Really? [Whispers] I thought she liked puzzles.
Gumball: Not anymore.
Anais: I'm now fluent in the beautiful art of dumbness.
Richard: Okay then. She's in.
Gumball, Darwin, Anais and Richard: [Gumball has a pineapple in his hands] LET'S PLAY FRUITBALL!!

Gumball: You know what, Mom?
Nicole: [Wakes up startled and accidentally takes picture] Yes sweetheart?
Gumball: [Throws puzzle piece away] I don't think this is gonna work out.
Nicole: Oh, I'm so glad you said that. Let's agree to never do this again. [Holds out her hand]
Gumball: [Shakes Nicole's hand] Done.
[Awkward silence for a few seconds]

Dr. Butt: [Sighs] I was only trying to help.
[Dr. Butt walks away and Nicole and Richard walk up to Gumball]

Richard: Four! Rocky and me are grown up.
Rocky: Word.
Nicole: And you, Gumball Watterson. That was a very dumb thing to do.
Gumball: Aww... Thanks!
Nicole: Ugh... And as for you, young lady, I expected more.
Anais: Aw mom. I think I don't wanna be dumb anymore. Because it hurts so bad!
Richard: And all this is because you guys wanted to be my favorite, when we all know in fact that Darwin is my favorite! [Anais, Nicole and Gumball glare at Richard] Fish! My favorite fish! [Suddenly realizes] Wait a minute...
