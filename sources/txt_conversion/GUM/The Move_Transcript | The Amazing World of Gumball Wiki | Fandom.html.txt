Lunchroom Anger
[The school cafeteria. Gumball is eyeing his lunch with reservation]
Gumball: Dude, I think they put so many additives in here, they forgot to add the actual food.
Darwin: It's not that bad. Don't you think I have a healthy glow?
[His skeleton glows]
Gumball: Haha! I think I'll pass.
[He lifts his plate and food melts through it. He holds it up and looks through the hole, revealing Clayton at the next table. He looks around and looks back at Clayton. Clayton seems to be glaring and Gumball does the same]
Gumball: Hmm!
Clayton: [Notices and squints harder] Hmmm!
Gumball: [Responds with a stronger glare] Hmmmm!
Clayton: Hmmmm!
Gumball: Grrr!
Clayton: Hmmm!
[The two growl at each other]
Darwin: What's going on here? Stop it! You're gonna get wrinkles!
Clayton: Hmmm!
Gumball: Grrr!
[They won't stop growling]
Darwin: Guys! Hey guys! All right. You asked for it. Say hello to DARKWIN! [Transforms into "Darkwin," complete with surrounding energy. Gumball and Clayton snap out of their glare contest]
Gumball: What was that for?!
Darwin: To stop you guys from hating on each other.
Gumball: What? Eh-he was the one giving me the stink eye!
Clayton: What? I was just trying to read the menu.
[Gumball notices the lunch menu on the pillar behind him]
Gumball: Oh, dude, I am so sorry.
Clayton: No, no. It was my fault. I apologize.
Darwin: Good. Now please shake hands.
[Gumball and Clayton do so]
Darwin: How about a little hug?
[They do so]
Darwin Little kiss?
Gumball: I think we're good.
[Darwin transforms back into "Darkwin"]
Darwin: KISS!
[Gumball gives Clayton a kiss]
Tobias' Annoyance to Girls
[The school hallway. Gumball puts his book in his locker, while Tobias hangs around nearby. Carmen passes by]
Tobias​​: [To Carmen] Hey, girl. [Wolf whistles, and Carmen pauses and stops smiling. Tobias proceeds to make random sounds, and Carmen becomes annoyed, hits him with her book, and walks away. Gumball and Darwin notice]
Gumball: Dude, what are you doing?
Tobias​​: [Whispers to Gumball] Things are getting pretty serious between me and Carmen.
Gumball: You mean she finally decided to take you to court?
Tobias​​: Pssh, she's just jealous because Masami is clearly into me! [To Masami] Hey, girl. [Wolf whistles, making Masami annoyed. She hits Tobias with her book, and he cries]
Gumball: Dude, are you okay? You seem to be crying.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: Who's crying? I'm not crying. [Points at Gumball] You're the one who cried!
Gumball: What?
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: You're the one who cried at lunchtime when a certain someone said they used a finger-touching heart-disintegrating move on you. [Sobs] And you cried, AND RAN AWAY! CRYING! [Runs away]
Gumball and Darwin: [Thinking] Hmmm…. Hmm..... Hmmmm..... Hmm.....
Gumball: You're just nodding without knowing why, aren't you?
Darwin: [Nods] Mm-hmm.
Gumball: It's Clayton, dude! He's been lying about us! C'mon, let's go speak to him.
Darwin: [Nods again]
In the Schoolyard
[Scene skips to Clayton taking a shower. Gumball barges in]
Gumball: Okay! We know you lied about a fight that didn't happen. So we're gonna stop you lying for good. But I'm not gonna let you speak because if I do, you'll just lie your way out of it. Okay, let's go! [Grabs Clayton]
[In the next scene, Gumball, Darwin and Clayton are out in the schoolyard]
Darwin: Clayton, you just can't keep lying like this. It'll ruin the rest of your life. Think about your future!
Gumball: What kind of job do you think a liar gets? Tell him Darwin.
Darwin: You could be an actor, or a banker, or a lawyer, or even better: the president!
Gumball: Uh, yeah. Exactly, so, um, it's pretty bad, okay? And also, what is this "finger-touch heart-disintegrating move" nonsense?
Clayton: What-it's true! I saw it on TV.
Gumball: Dude, what kind of world do you live in?
[Lightning strikes the air. Clayton becomes a muscular warrior standing on a hill in what seems to be a post-apocalyptic science-fiction world. He zaps two UFOs with his lazer vision, while Gumball and Darwin (dressed like Ancient Egyptian servants) approach him]
Gumball: Seriously! This is how you see yourself? And this is how you see us?
Darwin: Dude, you're living a lie!
Gumball: And a weird one too.
[Lightning strikes the air a second time. The whole thing is inside a thought bubble of Clayton. Gumball bursts the bubble]
Gumball: Alright, enough! You need to control yourself, man.
Clayton: But how?
Darwin: Why don't you just tell us what you're doing later.
Clayton: Well. After school, I'm gonna go pirate hunting with the president of the solar system in an underwater theme park where—
Darwin: Okay! Okay. Let's just try and take out half the things that aren't true.
Clayton: Okay. After school, I'm going hunting in a theme park with the president-
Gumball: Wow. Even your half-truths are full of absolute bunk. Okay, let's try and find out what that actually means. "Hunting with the president" and a "theme park." You're just gonna go shopping with your dad at the mall, aren't you.
Clayton: [Nods]
Gumball: You know, I think your problem is you deform reality because you're bored. And then you forget exactly what the truth was...[Notices Clayton is bored] and you're doing it right now, aren't you?
[Clayton imagines Gumball and Darwin as a monkey dressed as a cowboy riding a large dog]
In the Library
[Both Penny and Teri are reading books. Tobias also pretends to read a book while in between them. He puts down his book and turns to Teri]
Tobias​​​​​: Hey, girl.
[He wolf whistles and makes random sounds at her. She gets annoyed, throws her glass of water in his face, and walks away]
Tobias​​​​​: She's loving it.
Penny: [Annoyed] Really? She just threw a glass of water at your face.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: That's because she knows how hot I am. [Makes clicking sounds at Penny]
[Penny is tempted to throw her glass of water at Tobias' face, and Tobias opens his mouth. Penny spills the water to the floor instead, smirking. She puts her cup down and resumes reading her book. Tobias sighs, defeated]
[The scene switches to Gumball, Darwin, and Clayton. Gumball is holding a trashcan]
Gumball: Okay, Clayton, let's try a little exercise. We're gonna get all the lies out of you. Just give it all to the trashcan. It's like ralphing. You'll feel better once you get it all out of your system.
Clayton: I don't think that's big enough for all my lies.
Darwin: And there's holes in that basket. It's gonna leak everywhere.
Gumball: Dude, it's symboholic.
Darwin and Clayton: Huh?
Gumball: [Sighs, gestures to the can] You 'put your lie in the basket', okay? And it makes you feel better.
[Darwin and Clayton still have no clue]
Gumball: Okay, whatever. Just go for it.
Clayton: [Inhales, then lets out a literal whirlwind of lies] MY DAD SPENT THIRTY YEARS IN JAIL FOR A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT, NOW HE IS AN AVENGING SUPERHERO!!!
[As Clayton lets all his lies out, Gumball is struggling not to be blown away by the whirlwind]
Gumball: Uh, okay. Okay STOP! I don't think you understood! Ah!
Clayton: MY MOM IS AN FBI AGENT WHO SAVED THE PRESIDENT TWICE!!! I DIDN'T GO TO MOON ABOARD THE APOLLO ELEVEN BECAUSE I HAD CHICKENPOX THAT DAY!!! I HAVE TRAINED ONE THOUSAND FOWLS WHEN THEY GO TO MIGRATE!!! I'M AN EXPERT OF KARATE, BUT ONLY IN SPACE!!!
[Gumball, books, and papers are blown away, and still struggles to go back to Clayton. On his way, Teri flies into him, and he shrugs her off]
Gumball: WHA-HA-HA-HA!
[The Librarian at her desk flies by. Gumball barely avoids some pencils]
Clayton: I INVENTED THE GULF, THE WATER AND THE HAMBURGER!!!
[Finally, Gumball grabs a dictionary, and stops Clayton. He points at a word]​​​​​​​
Darwin: "Serving as a symbol. Significant purely in terms of what is being represented or implied." Ohhhh, you meant symbolic.
Gumball: YES!
Librarian: Shhh!
Gumball: What?
At the Classroom
Gumball: Okay Clayton. We need to get to the root of all this lying.
Darwin: Why do you think you do this?
Clayton: [Hesitant] Well...the thing is—
Gumball: [Hugs Clayton] Shhh...just tell us in your own time. [Releases Clayton]
Clayton: …Well, I guess it's because—
Gumball: [Hugs Clayton] Shhh...It's alright. Just speak when you feel the moment is right. [Releases Clayton]
Clayton: [Opens mouth to speak]
Gumball: [Hugs Clayton] Shhh...it's okay dude. We're here for you. [Releases Clayton]
Clayton: [Opens mouth to speak]
Darwin: [Tackles Gumball] Okay go.
Clayton: It's because I'm a loser, okay!?! I don't like the real me, so I lie. I prefer to live in a world where-where everyone likes me, and thinks I'm awesome.
Gumball: But dude. You don't have to lie to make people like you. [Hugs]
Darwin: Yeah, you've got lots of awesome qualities. [Hugs]
Clayton: I do? Like what?
Darwin: Ha ha. Too many to list.
Clayton: Try.
[Silence]
Gumball: Y-you're…you're red!
Darwin: You…have teeth!
Gumball: You…are…you? And that makes you special.
Clayton: [Enlightened] You're right! I guess being someone is good enough. I don't need to lie anymore. [Hugs Gumball] Thanks dudes!
Gumball: Dude, chill out! No need to get all emotional. Haha, just kidding.
Gumball, Darwin and Clayton: [Laugh]
Clayton: [Pokes Gumball's nose] Booop!
Gumball, Darwin and Clayton: [Laugh]
Gumball: [Pokes Clayton's "nose"] Booop!
Gumball, Darwin and Clayton: [Laugh]
Clayton: [Pokes Darwin's nose] Booop!
Gumball, Darwin and Clayton: [Laugh]
Gumball: Okay, that's too much now.
Darwin: So! Now you can go tell Tobias you lied about the fight.
Tobias' Fate
[Tobias is at the schoolyard, leaning on a bench and thinking he's so attractive. He whistles, and makes flirtatious clicking sounds at Sarah. Sarah is disgusted, and flings some of herself at Tobias. Then Gumball, Darwin and Clayton go to him]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Wipes the ice cream off his face] Look at that guys, they're literally throwing themselves at me.
Gumball: Dude, please stop. You're giving me second-hand shame.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Well, Clayton knows what girls are like. Don't you, buddy? [Whispering] He once dated sextuplets…at the same time!
Gumball: Hmm. Sounds complicated, and repetitive— and a LIE! Isn't that right Clayton?
Clayton: Yeah. I've never really had a girlfriend because I'm socially awkward. Also, I have glandular problems: my liver starts to smell when I get too close to a girl. I-it makes my mouth smell of burnt tires and hummus.
Gumball: Okay. Good honesty. A little too much information, but good nonetheless.
Clayton: Also I've got a contagious rash on—
Gumball: WHOA whoa whoa-alright! I'd like to sleep this month, thank you very much.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Wait! What about the story about you, and the bear?
Darwin: Lies.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: What about the time you drove a speedboat through the mall?
Gumball: Lies.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: What!? What about the finger-touching-heart-disintegrating move?
Gumball and Darwin: Lies.
Clayton: Oh, no. Actually, that's true.
Gumball: Aw, man. You were doing great, and now you bring that stuff back?
Clayton: It's true, though.
Darwin: We all know it's not.
Clayton: It is!
Gumball: Oh, really? Then please, be our guest. Do it. Do it right here, right now in front of all of us. Do your "special move" on Tobias.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Yeah! [Realizes Gumball's statement] Wait, what? No, no.
Gumball: Eh, don't worry. You'll be fine because that's all a lie! This guy can't do Kung-Fu. He's in a permanent state of sitting.
Clayton: [Angered] Oh, yeah? Okay, you asked for this.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: No, I didn't! He did!
[Clayton does his special move on Tobias: he pokes some spots on his body while making sound effects. Nothing happens, and Tobias laughs]
Gumball: Really? You made the Kung-Fu sound with your mouth?
Darwin: You were doing so well.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Okay, I'm gonna bounce. I've got gals in different locales!
[As Tobias walks away, he slows down. He drops to his knees, and falls down unmoving. Clayton, Gumball and Darwin all gasp. They all go to his body. After that, they start flailing their arms while screaming hysterically offscreen.]
Gumball: Wait, we can't leave him like that.
Darwin: We got to do something!
Clayton: Like what?
Gumball: ANYTHING!
Clayton: How about CPR?
Gumball: CPR!? You disintegrated his heart, you NUT BURGER! Look at him! He was a young man, with his whole life ahead of him. The guy didn't even get a chance to have a girlfriend.
[Suddenly, Tobias reacts to this: he whistles, and does some clicking sounds unconsciously]
Darwin: How does that work? Is it like when chickens lose their heads, and they can still run around?
Gumball: No dude. It means he's alive! Oh! [Laughs in relief] We didn't ice him, we just knocked him out…which is still mega-bad. Okay, okay! No one can see this. Come on, we gotta hide him while we figure out what to do! [Pulls Tobias' arm] Ugh! Why are people so much heavier when they're unconscious? [Pulls arm again]
Darwin: Maybe it's 'cause you're standing on his back.
Gumball: Oh. [Laughs nervously]
Darwin: Just grab him by the armpit.
[They grab him by both arms. Both Gumball and Darwin avoid his sweaty armpits]
Gumball: Ugh. I can see why the guy wears so many sweatbands.
[They repeatedly nudge him, carry him, then drop him on the ground]
Darwin: Oh! I found a good handhold.
In the Hallway
[Gumball, Darwin and Clayton (with Tobias' body) sneak through the school hallways. Darwin struggles while dragging Tobias' body, using his teeth as a handhold]
Gumball: Come on, stop wasting time!
[Gumball speaks to Clayton]
Gumball: Okay! If anyone sees us, we're gonna need a good lie from you.
Clayton: You said lying was bad!
Gumball: Yes, I know. I did. But in special circumstances, when you need to help someone you really care about, it's okay.
Clayton: [Whispering] Like who?
Gumball: Me. Now come on!
[They run through the hallway. Then they hear Banana Joe whistling]
Gumball: [Gasp] Someone's coming! Quick, hide!
[All of them except for Darwin (with Tobias' body) find places to hide. Gumball hides in a locker]
Darwin: What should I do!?
Gumball: Think fast! [Slams locker shut]
[Banana Joe whistles merrily along the corridor. He walks by Darwin and Tobias disguised as a potted plant (with Darwin being the pot, and Tobias being the plant). Then he stops whistling as he notices something]
Banana Joe: [Suspiciously] Hmmm.
Darwin: [Whimpers]
[Banana Joe walks back to Darwin. But he stops near Darwin, and instead reads a note that is posted near where he is]
Banana Joe: "Sign up for hall monitor duties." [Laughs] "Doodies." [Walks away]
Darwin: [Sighs in relief]
Caught in the End
[Gumball, Darwin and Clayton with Tobias rush through the hallway once more]
Clayton: So what's the plan now?
Gumball: I don't know. I'm making it up as I go along. We need to work out what we're gonna say if—
[They encounter Carrie. She looks at Tobias with an annoyed expression]
Gumball: [Voicing over Tobias] Hey, what's up girl?
[Darwin moves Tobias' mouth, while Gumball imitates his whistling. Carrie smacks him upside the head with her book, and he hits the wall. She floats away.]
Gumball: And he went for first place, but she hit it out of the park!
Darwin: That's it! [Evil eyes] All we gotta do is make it look like he got knocked out by a girl.
Gumball: [Evil eyes] Oh, I love it when you're evil.
Darwin: This is me at my most evil.
Gumball: Do your evil laugh.
Darwin: [Evil laugh]
Gumball: Okay, let's get on with it.
[Gumball and Darwin lean Tobias precariously against a window. Out the window, many girls can be seen]
Gumball: Ah, perfect. The playground is full of girls.
Darwin: How are we gonna get him down there without all the teachers noticing?
Gumball: We need something cunning, something clever. Something subtle.
[Tobias falls out of the window. Gumball, Darwin and Clayton see him, his fall cushioned by trashbags]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Groans]
Gumball: Yeah. Something like that. Clayton! You find a girl. Any girl. We'll meet you down at the playground.
[Clayton nods, and they go their ways. Gumball and Darwin carry Tobias' body again, and manipulate him as if he were not unconscious. They move his arms and gesture at other students as if he were greeting them.]
Gumball: [Voicing over Tobias] H-h-hi! How's it going? Hey! Hello. [Laughs]
[Gumball and Darwin go to a distant spot in the playground, and drop Tobias. Clayton heads for them, dragging Jamie along with a stretched arm]
Jamie: [Struggling] You are gonna get it! [Struggling] You are so gonna get it!
Gumball: What did you bring Jamie for?
Clayton: You said any girl.
Darwin: Well, at least people will believe she knocked Tobias out.
[Tobias starts moving]
Gumball: Ah. He's waking up! Just get her into position.
Clayton: Wait…this is lying. You can't just frame Jamie for knocking out Tobias.
Jamie: What?! You were gonna frame me for knocking out [Punches fist into palm] Tobias?
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: What?! You guys knocked me out, and were gonna frame Jamie?
Nigel Brown: What?! You knocked out one student, and were gonna blame another?
[Darwin and Gumball suck in their breath and do the finger-touching-heart-disintegrating move on all of them. They stop for a moment and keep continuing the move. Tobias, Clayton, Principal Brown, and Jamie all look confused, and the episode ends]
