Give Her Back!
[On the school bus on the way to school, Anais is trying to get her Daisy the Donkey doll back from being thrown around by Tobias and Carrie]
Tobias​​​​​ : You want it, come and get it.
Anais: Hey, give it back! Put it down! Daisy! Leave her alone!
[She turns around towards Gumball and Darwin]
Tobias : I got it!
Carrie: Come on, Tobias, over here!
Anais: Gumball, do something!
Gumball: Sorry, there's nothing I can do, sis. You broke childhood rule number four: never get a toy out on a school bus.
Anais: You were the one who brought her on board!
Gumball: Oh. Well, let that be a lesson to all of us.
Anais: [Makes a pleading face] Oh, Gumball, please get Daisy back for me. That's what big brothers are supposed to do.
Gumball: Hmm... I don't know. I'm not much of a fighter. I'm more of a, uh...
Darwin: A coward?
Gumball: That's the word.
[Anais starts whimpering with big puppy eyes]
Gumball: [Sighs] Okay, let me see what I can do.
[Gumball walks towards Tobias, who is holding Daisy]
Tobias​​​​​​​ : Come on, who wants it next?
Gumball: Hey, punks, give me that donkey or else.
Tobias​​​​​​​ : Pbht. Or what?
Gumball: [Laughs evilly] You do not wanna know.
Tobias​​​​​​​ : Really? [holds Daisy outside a window] What if I do this?
Gumball: Then you would unleash the full fury of my terrifying anger. Mountains will shake! [Anais looks on, impressed] Cities will crumble! The sky could be ripped apart, and the meteor of my wrath will grind you to dust!
[Tobias lets go of Daisy]
Tobias​​​​​​​ : Oops.
Gumball: Oh, man. Kind of hoped you'd buy the bluff.
[Anais runs to the rear window and bangs on it repeatedly]
Anais: Daisy! [Screaming] NOOOOO! NO! NO! NOOO!
[Anais keeps crying]
Gumball: Relax sis, It's only a toy.
Anais: [Deep voice] NO, IT'S NOT!
[Gumball and Darwin slightly back away in fear]
Gumball: [Scared] Okay, we'll get it back.
[Gumball and Darwin smiles nervously]
Anais: [Faintly] Daisyyyyyy!
[The school bus speeds off and Leslie walks into the street, noticing the doll]
Leslie​​​​​​​: Oh.
[Leslie picks up Daisy and walks away]
School Playground
[Gumball and Darwin are talking to Leslie]
Gumball: Seriously, dude, you got to give it back. My sister is blowing a fuse.
Leslie​​​​​​ : Sorry, guys. I gave it to Juke.
[Gumball and Darwin go to Juke, who makes beat-boxing noises and shrugs]
Gumball: Nice beats, but not much help.
[Juke waves his arms and points to a bench with Daisy on it, and Gumball and Darwin run toward it]
Gumball and Darwin: Daisy!
Darwin: Yay!
Gumball: Whoo-hoo!
[When they reach the bench, Hector sits on it]
Gumball: Ahem! Hector, I think you're sitting on something.
[Hector stands up with the doll on his butt]
Gumball: [To Darwin] Uh, okay, this is a little embarrassing. You tell him.
Darwin: [With a posh accent] Excuse me, sir. You appear to have a little something stuck to your right... buttock.
Hector: Huh?
[Hector flicks the doll off of his behind]
Gumball: I got it! [Runs for it] I got it! [He catches the doll, but it slips back out] Ah, what is wrong with me?! [He finally grabs it] Ah! Got it! Ugh!
[Gumball crashes into a basketball pole, and the doll continues flying away]
Darwin: I got it, I got it, I got it! [Comes back] I don't got it.
Gumball: Why?
[Darwin points at Tina, who has the doll and is playing with it]
Daisy the Donkey​​​​​​: Sweet Dreams.
[Tina laughs. Gumball and Darwin approach her]
Darwin: Excuse me, m'lady, but it seems-
[Tina roars at them]
Darwin: Plan B?
Gumball: Y-Y-Yeah.
The Hallway
[Anais is at her locker, sad because of her lost doll, when Gumball and Darwin arrive]
Gumball: Anais, Anais! [Shows her a bootleg Daisy] Look what we found.
Anais: [Gasps] Daisy! [Goes to grab it, but notices something] Wait a minute. That's not the real one.
Gumball: No, it's much better. [Winds up the doll] Look.
Fake Daisy: [In Chinese] I am Daisy the small donkey, I love to dance. I am Daisy the small donkey, I love to...
[The fake doll burns and breaks. Gumball and Darwin look at Anais nervously]
Anais: Weak attempt to pawn me off with a cheap replacement. Where's my Daisy? [Examines Gumball and Darwin] Sweaty hands... nervous body language. You know who's got her, don't you?
Gumball and Darwin: [They avoid eye contact] Noooooo...
Anais: Your eyes just darted to the left. You're lying, aren't you?
Gumball and Darwin: [They avoid eye contact again] Noooooo...
Anais: [Thinks for a moment] It's Tina, isn't it?
Gumball and Darwin: [They avoid eye contact again] Nooo—
[Gumball and Darwin look down dejectedly]
Gumball: Yeah, it's Tina.
The Wattersons
[Gumball, Darwin, and Anais are in their bedroom]
Anais: Listen, Gumball, I am not spending the night without Daisy. You'll just have to go to Tina's place and get her back.
Gumball: What?! Why me?!
Anais: Because— because— [Makes a cute face] Because you were the one who lost it in the first place.
Gumball: [Makes a cute face too] But I'm just a little boy, and she's a giant T-Rex.
Anais: But you are my big brother.
Gumball: But I don't want to get my face pounded to a pulp.
[Both of them continue to exchange cute faces at each other until Gumball gives in]
Gumball: Fine. I'll go.
[Anais giggles]
Gumball: But you two are coming with me.
[Darwin and Anais both groan with exasperation and acceptance]
At Tina's
[Gumball, Darwin and Anais are peeking through a gap in the door of Tina's room]
Gumball: Man, this place is scary. Is that really her bedroom?
Anais: It's a dump.
Gumball: Literally.
Anais: It's really sad.
Gumball: [Gasps] Look.
[Gumball points at Tina, who has the doll in her arms]
Anais: Daisy!
[They stop looking through the gap]
Gumball: Okay, here's the plan-get inside, lift up her arm, take the toy and get out of there. You got that, Darwin? Go.
Darwin: I'm not doing that!
Gumball: I'm not either. There's a T-Rex in there.
Anais: Well, one of you better go. Otherwise, I'm telling Mom.
Gumball: Hmm... [Considering] getting told off by Mom or fighting a T-Rex... Mom, T-Rex, Mom, T-Rex...
Darwin: Well, I'm going with the T-Rex.
Gumball: Yeah. No contest.
[Gumball and Darwin enter Tina's room, Darwin making squeaking noises as they walk]
Gumball: [Quietly] Darwin, why are you making that noise?!
Darwin: [Quietly] I'm sorry! I always do it when I'm nervous.
Gumball: [Quietly] Well, stop it!
Darwin: [Squeaks while covering his mouth]
[Darwin covers his mouth, and they continue walking. When they are near Tina, she makes a movement that scares them]
Gumball: [Quietly] I'm not getting any closer to that thing. Wait here. [Walks to Anais] Anais!
Anais: [Quietly] What?!
Gumball: [Quietly] You see that pole over there? Throw it to me.
[Gumball holds up his hands]
Anais: [Quietly] Okay.
Darwin: [Quietly] No, no. He can't catch.
Anais: [Quietly] Here it comes.
[Anais throws the pole. Gumball misses the catch, and hits Darwin]
Darwin: Ow!
[The pole hits the metal junk]
Tina: Huh?
[Tina goes back to sleep]
Gumball: Phew!
[Anais expertly throws the pole and Gumball jumps to grab it, but misses and it hits Darwin, knocking him down, before clattering on the ground. Tina stirs, but does not wake up, and Gumball sighs in relief]
Darwin: [Quietly] I'm okay.
Gumball: Shh!
[Gumball shushes him, picks up the pole, and begins poking Tina]
Darwin: [Quietly] Careful. Careful!
Gumball: [Quietly] I'm sorry! It's just really hard to maneuver a long pole.
[Darwin laughs]
Darwin: [Quietly] Look, it's like she's smiling.
[Gumball has on the corner of Tina's mouth and moves it up and down, making her look happy and sad]
Darwin: [Quietly] Happy, sad, happy, sad.
[Gumball and Darwin snicker quietly]
Gumball: [Quietly] Hey, Darwin, look. [Pokes Tina's nose and puts the pole into her mouth] Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
[Gumball begins picking Tina's nose and poking at her mouth, making noises. They both snicker quietly. Anais walks up behind them]
Anais: [Quietly] What are you doing?!
Gumball: [Quietly] Don't worry. She'll never wake up.
[Tina stirs again, frightening Gumball, Darwin and Anais, and rolls over on top of Daisy]
Gumball: [Quietly] Okay, I think we have to move her.
[With difficulty, Gumball and Darwin move Tina until they can see Daisy again]
Gumball: [To Darwin] Hold it, buddy! Let me see.
[Gumball reaches out for Daisy]
Darwin: [Squeals in pain] Gumball!
Gumball: Shh! What?
Darwin: You have to help me.
Gumball: Yeah, yeah, just two seconds.
Darwin: [In pain] Gumball...
[Darwin falls under Tina and Gumball gasps, but Darwin manages to get out from under her]
Darwin: [Quietly] I'm okay.
[Gumball and Anais sigh in relief and Gumball gasps when he sees Daisy, grabbing her]
Gumball: [Quietly] Yes, yes! I got it!
[Gumball lifts up Daisy, but the doll's string is caught on Tina's finger, and it then frees itself]
Daisy the Donkey​​​​​​: Sweet Dreams!
[Daisy starts braying and Tina suddenly wakes up]
Gumball: [Squealing] Run.
[The kids run off screaming with Tina chasing them]
The Chase
Anais: Gumball!
Gumball: What?!
Anais: Gumball!
Gumball: What?!
[Gumball sees Tina right behind them and screams. The three hide in a car and Gumball tries to roll up the window, but Tina stops him, so Gumball locks the door. Tina tries to open the door from the open window, but can't reach it and Gumball, Darwin, and Anais laugh at her. Tina walks away]
Gumball: Phew. I think we're safe now.
[The roof of the car caves in and the three scream and Gumball opens the door]
Gumball: Run!
[They run off]
Gumball: [To Anais] Where's Darwin?
[Darwin runs past them]
Anais: This was a stupid idea!
Gumball: I know! Should we just give it to her?
Anais: No! She's mine!
Gumball: Okay, you have it, then.
[Gumball tosses Daisy at Anais, who trips, and runs off]
Anais: Gumball, help me!
Gumball: I can't! I'm too much of a coward!
[Darwin glares at Gumball, who sighs]
Gumball: Fine. Throw me Daisy! It's what's she after.
Anais: Okay. Go long.
[Anais throws Daisy and Tina, Gumball, and Darwin run after it]
Darwin: Gumball, she's after us now!
Gumball: Don't worry. You know I can't catch.
[Daisy lands in Gumball's outstretched hands and he and Darwin stop running]
Gumball: I hate myself.
[Gumball gives Daisy to Darwin and runs off]
Darwin: I hate yourself. [He screams and runs from Tina]
Gumball: Psst! Over here!
[Darwin hides behind a car with Gumball and after Tina runs by, they run in the other direction]
Gumball: [Gasps] The gate! We're nearly there. It's almost over.
[Tina appears in front of the gate]
Tina: Not so fast.
[They stop running and scream]
Darwin: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa-
[Gumball puts his hand on Darwin's mouth]
Gumball: Darwin, keep absolutely still. Her vision is based on movement.
Tina: That only works in movies.
[Tina roars and they scream and she runs toward them, but is caught underneath a crane claw]
Gumball: Huh?
[Gumball and Darwin look up and see Anais]
Anais: Yea!
[Anais gets off the crane]
Anais: Daisy!
Gumball: You know, Tina, there's a lesson in this somewhere. Don't mess with the Wattersons. I'm hot. I know it. You're not. You know it.
[Gumball and Darwin do a dance]
Gumball: Who's the boss now?
Tina: I'm sorry. It's just that I never had a toy before. I swear, I-I wanted to give it back, but... she helped me to sleep. [Her voice breaks] It's just so scary here.
[Tina gives them a sad look]
Gumball: Man, those puppy eyes again. I feel really bad now.
Anais: You know what, Tina? I think you need Daisy more than I do.
[Anais puts Daisy down in front of Tina]
Tina: Really?
Anais: Yeah. She'll look after you when you're scared. Besides, I don't need her anymore. I've got Darwin and Gumball to look after me.
Gumball and Darwin: [Sigh] Group hug.
[They hug]
Tina: That's very touching. But now you'd better start running.
Gumball, Darwin and Anais: Why?
Tina: My dad eats trespassers.
[Tina's dad comes up behind them and roars]
