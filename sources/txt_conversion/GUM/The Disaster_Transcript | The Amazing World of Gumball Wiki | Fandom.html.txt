Going to the Mall
[The Wattersons are driving to the Elmore Mall]
Gumball: [Stares out the window and yawns]
Nicole: Oh, come on kids. [Sings] Stop it with your yawning, it's a lovely morning. [Points finger at Richard]
Richard: [Sings] We're off to buy some stuff at the Elmore Mall. [Points finger at Anais]
Anais: [Sings] Saturdays are cool. [Points finger at Darwin]
Darwin: [Sings] Cause we don't go to school.
[Anais and Darwin point their fingers at Gumball, who is still staring outside the window. Anais pokes Gumball in response]
Gumball: [Sings nervously] And I am gonna buy some donkey... drool. [Spoken] Sorry, that's all I had.
Nicole: [Continues singing] Nothing can go wrong.
[Richard, Darwin and Anais join in]
Darwin, Anais, Richard, and Nicole: We'll be happy all day long. And that's the reason why we sing this song.
Magic Universal Remote
[The camera cuts to the Elmore Mall parking lot, where a red van is parked]
Van shopkeeper: Be careful with this universal remote, it has a power only a fool would not fear. Tell me, for what will you use it?
Rob​: [Steps out of the van] Oh you know, for TVs, DVD players... VENGEANCE!
Van shopkeeper: No! It cannot be used for evil! Give me that!
[A black cloudy hand reaches out from the van and tries to grab the remote away]
Rob​: Back off, old man! [Presses the power button on the remote]
[The van starts driving forward. Rob presses the arrows on the remote to try to stop the van. Eventually, the van lands on its side]
Rob​​​​​​​​: [Presses the stop button to stop the van] Amazing...!
[Rob points the remote at an ATM and presses eject. The ATM starts spilling money. Rob then points the remote at a fire sprinkler, turning it on. Next he runs to the right side of the parking lot and turns the day into night, then runs to the left side and turns it back into day. Finally, he rewinds back in time to a scene from "The Void." He stands behind Gumball, Darwin and Mr. Small in the Void]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​: Look, children. All the mistakes the world has ever made.
[Rob watches his past self trying to get Gumball and Darwin's attention]
Rob​​​: Guys! Guys! Over here!
[Rob watches his past self cling to the van as they leave, and as Janice drives off, Rob watches his past self getting ejected from the Void, leaving him with the disfigured look he now has. He then watches a scene from "The Nobody" where his past self sits on a bench and Gumball and Darwin talk to him]
Gumball: There's no bad guy here! You could be our mortal enemy!
Rob​​​​​​​​: You turned me into the villain, Gumball Watterson. You left me with this broken body. You gave me this ridiculous voice. Well now, [Points the remote at himself and resets his voice] I'm in control! [Fast forwards back to the van] And the time has come for you to pay.
Van shopkeeper: [Reaches out] Same for you buddy. That remote was twelve ninety-nine.
[Rob presses a button on the remote, erasing the shopkeeper from existence as he cries out in pain]
The Wattersons: [Singing] There's no space to park, but we're having such a lark that we don't like having to wait until it's dark.
Gumball: Break it down! [Makes scratching sound using the window]
Nicole: [Stops the car] Gumball, honey, could you stop that?
Gumball: What? It's not hurting anyone. [Continue making the scratching sound]
Nicole: Yes, well, it's grating and I'm driving. [Starts the car] Gumball, I said stop.
[The car ascends a level in the parking lot. Rob sees the car and smiles]
Rob​​​​​​​​: [Hides behind a parked car] Prepare to suffer!
Nicole: Gumball, I won't ask you again!
Gumball: But I'm just playing with...
[Rob pauses the car]
Rob​​​​​​​​: [Walks up to the car] I will destroy you and everyone you love. [Starts the engines of all the cars around the Wattersons, walks away and hits play]
Gumball: ...the window. I mean, what's the worst that can happen?
[All of the cars drive towards the Wattersons and crash at the same time. The camera zooms out to reveal their car was destroyed on top of the pileup. The Wattersons leave the destroyed car and walk towards the exit]
Gumball: [Sings nervously] Everyone is happy, 'cause they realize it wasn’t my fault and even if it was I wouldn't have done it on purpose and therefore they forgive me-
Nicole: I told you to stop playing with that window but you never listen! Talking to you can be like... trying to comb the skin of a kiwi fruit!
Gumball: What?
Nicole: This is gonna cost a fortune! Do you think money grows on trees - well I guess it does 'cause it's made of paper - but that’s not the point! I’m cutting off your allowance, we're broke enough as it is! I'm so angry I can't think of words so I’m just gonna make sounds! [Growls and snarls angrily, then storms in the mall]
[The others sigh angrily at Gumball, and start walking in as well. Gumball sighs sadly]
Video Game Bargain Bin
[The scene cuts to a Laser Video store. Gumball and Darwin are inside, standing next to a bargain bin]
Gumball: Aww, cheer up, dude! Look, we still got two dollars, we can buy a game from here!
Darwin: Everyone knows the bargain bin is a grandma Christmas trap. [Sighs and takes a game] Extreme Tractor Racing. The review says: "Here's a cheat code. Go left, forward, forward, right, forward, back to the store where you bought it and ask for a refund."
Gumball: [Takes a different game] Daisy the Donkey the video game! [Reads review] "If boredom didn't put you into a coma during the show, then this game will finish the job..."
Darwin: [Takes another game] Hey, look! They have a new Legend of Zelmore! [Looks at the disk more closely] Wait, what? The Tale of Zolmore? For PolyStation? [Opens the case] There's not even a disk inside! It's painted on the box! It's a knockoff!
[Rob appears outside]
Losing Darwin
Rob​​​​​​​​​: [Menacingly] Now, prepare to lose your brother.
[He points the remote at Gumball and turns the subtitles on]
Darwin: Now we have nothing to play for the whole summer.
[Gumball sighs. Subtitles appear in front of him]
Darwin: [Reads the subtitles] "If we hadn't adopted him, we would have enough money." A-are you serious?!
[Gumball notices the subtitles and shrugs. The subtitles change to read: "Isn't it obvious?"]
Darwin: What do you mean, "Isn't it obvious?!"
[The subtitles change again to "Are you stupid?"]
Darwin: [Reads the subtitles; crying] Am I stupid?! [He runs away crying]
Gumball: Dude, what's wrong with you?!
[The subtitles change again]
Gumball: [Reading the subtitles] "Apart from the fact you're a glorified pet that looks like a tiny orange sausage?"
[Darwin throws a video game at Gumball]
Gumball: Ow! Dude! DUDE!
[Gumball starts running. The subtitles move with him]
Gumball: Hey, wait-
[The edges of the subtitles hit the doorway and they fall apart, the letters spilling all over the floor. Gumball is knocked backwards]
Gumball: [Gets up] What's going on? Darwin! DARWIN!
[He starts running after Darwin]
Gumball: [Starts crying] Buddy, plea- I didn't mean to upset you!
[Gumball runs towards an escalator]
Gumball: Darwin! [Sees someone] Darwin! Wha?
[The camera reveals a person with a large, hot dog-shaped head with Darwin-shaped hair]
Hot Dog Guy lookalike​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: You thought I was the Hot Dog Guy, right?
Gumball: Uh, no, I thought you were my brother Darwin.
Hot Dog Guy lookalike​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Oh. That's a nice change.
[Gumball runs down the escalator, where he finds Richard, Nicole and Anais]
Gumball: Mom! Dad! [Cries]
Nicole: [Hugs Gumball] Don't worry, sweetie. We'll find him.
Gumball: [Continues to cry]
Richard: Of course we understand you when you're making no sense, we're your family!
Anais: I think I mistranslated a word, though. When you said: [Imitates Gumball crying] did you really mean "evil magic subtitles?"
[Rob hides behind a column aiming the remote at Gumball's parents]
Losing the Family
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Menacingly] And now it's time for you to lose your parents. Parental filter: off. [Turns off the parental filter]
Richard: Okay, Nicole, here's the plan. You sort out this mess and I'll get a box of doughnuts and eat away the stress this family keeps dumping on me.
Nicole: Honey, I know it's difficult because it's so prominent, but could you please forget your stomach for a minute?
Richard: It's your nagging voice I wish I could forget!
Nicole: I wish I could forget you forgetting our anniversary!
Richard: [To Gumball and Anais] Sorry, kids, could you just cover your ears for a sec?
[Gumball and Anais cover their ears. Richard and Nicole then have a muffled argument]
Richard: Your mother and I have come to an agreement. I'm getting a doughnut and she's getting a better husband.
Gumball and Anais: WHAT?!
[Nicole storms off angrily. Richard starts to panic]
Richard: Gumball, please look after your sister. I'm gonna go and de-ruin our lives! [Runs after Nicole]
Anais: Dad, wait! [Runs after Richard]
Gumball: Where are you going?!
[Rob is still hiding behind the column]
Anais: [Stops running] He managed to win Mom over once, doing it again would be like nailing a backflip in high heels on a tightrope! [Starts running again]
Gumball: I'm supposed to be looking after you! [Runs after Anais]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Menacingly] You will lose them all.
[Rob turns down the brightness until the screen goes completely black]
Gumball: [Still running] Anais, wait!
[Rob turns the brightness back up, revealing Gumball lost in a crowd. Gumball spots Anais and chases her, but Rob turns down the brightness again just as he catches up to his sister]
Gumball: [Jumps up] Gotcha!
[The screen becomes pitch black; a splat and a scream can be heard. Rob turns the brightness all the way back up, revealing Sarah lying on the ground with Gumball's face on hers. He gets up with ice cream around his mouth and sees Penny. He shakes off the ice cream]
Losing Penny
Gumball: [To Penny] I know- I know there's no way to make this look okay, but I'm gonna try anyway.
[Rob peeks from behind a vending machine and changes the language spoken from English to Cantonese]
Gumball: 佩妮! 有人成日都玩緊我, 而家睇嚟我呃你。[Subtitles: Penny! Someone has been messing with me all day, and now it looks like I'm cheating on you.]
Penny: 我知你唔會咁背叛我, 但係呢種語言聽起黎好似係我哋拗緊, 所以而家我好沮喪! [Subtitles: I know you wouldn't betray me like this, but this language sounds like we're arguing, so now I'm upset!] [Starts crying and runs away]
Gumball: 冇佩妮, 請稍候! [Subtitles: No Penny, please wait!] [Starts running after Penny]
[Rob smiles and presses "Fast Forward" on the remote, speeding the chase up. Penny runs up the escalator and Gumball accidentally pushes her through the glass railing. She screams and, as her drink hits the floor, Rob pauses the scene]
Gumball: Huh?
[Gumball runs down the escalator and sees Nicole hugging Hank's arm]
Gumball: W-What is this?
[He encounters Anais crying in a crowd]
Gumball: What's going on?
[He walks by Penny falling in mid-air]
Rob​​​​​​​​​: [Off-screen] I did warn you.
[Rob walks towards Richard, who is crying and eating doughnuts]
Rob​​​​​​​​​: I said I would destroy you, [Takes Richard's wallet and pulls out a family photo] and everyone you love. [Tears the photo in half]
Gumball: You! [Falls to his knees] It was YOU who did all this! My arch-nemesis, Roy!
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: No, no, no, my name isn't- MY NAME IS ROB, GOSHDARN IT! [Stomps foot]
Gumball: Okay, I'm sorry. But... how have you done this?
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: With THIS. [Shows Gumball the remote]
Gumball: But why?
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Wait up. This requires the right mood.
[Rob changes the format to a widescreen format and turns down the contrast. Sad music starts to play]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: You have only yourself to blame. You being the hero of all this means that I have to be the villain! But I never wanted to be the villain! I wanted to be the cute sidekick who gets his own plush toy and a spinoff show.
Gumball: What are you talking about?
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: You really don't get it, do you? So happy to star in your "amazing world." Can't you see that none of this is real?!
[The camera zooms back to reveal more of the mall. Gumball looks around]
Gumball: I-I don't understand.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Sighs] It doesn't matter. Once you're out of the picture I can be WHOEVER I WANT!
[Rob presses the AV button. An entrance to the Void appears behind Gumball]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: I'm sorry, Gumball Watterson. THERE'S NO OTHER WAY! [Prepares to kick Gumball into the Void]
Gumball: NO! [Tackles Rob]
Fighting for the Remote
[The remote slips away from their grasp. Rob and Gumball roll over as they fight each other. The two roll over the remote, causing smooth jazz music to play]
Gumball: Is it me, or does this music have a whole different vibe to this situation?
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Yeah, hold on.
[The two roll back over the remote, turning off the music. They continue fighting. Rob kicks Gumball dangerously close to the Void. He goes to grab the remote, then looks as Gumball runs towards him. Gumball knocks the remote away, causing it to hit a wall and flip over, turning on slow-motion. Rob tries to punch Gumball, but his slow punch does nothing. Gumball attempts the same, but his punch is too slow. Rob tries again, to no avail. They both shrug and look at the remote. Gumball grabs it while Rob tries to hold him back]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [In slow-motion] Give me that remote you little—
[Gumball presses the power off button at Rob, making him suddenly drop. The speed returns to normal]
Gumball: Ha! In your face! [Pauses] Dude?
[Gumball runs to Rob]
Gumball: Oh my gosh. Rolf? Talk to me, Ralph! Oh, what have I done?! Ron, wake up! Please, Ross, are you okay? Talk to me, Raj! [Starts crying] What have I done to you? Oh, Rose—
[Gumball sets the remote down on Rob. It slides off, turning the power back on]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Wakes up] THAT'S NOT EVEN A MAN'S NAME!
[Gumball screams and falls backwards. Rob grabs the remote, corners Gumball, and changes the format to repeatedly hit his head. Gumball leaps at Rob but fails to grab the remote and is ejected towards the Void. Rob walks up to him]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Time to eject you, once and for all.
[He raises the remote at Gumball and presses "Eject" but nothing happens. Rob angrily mashes the button while Gumball gets up]
Gumball: The batteries are dead! What now?
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Well, I guess you're gonna do what any hero would do to save the ones he loves. You're gonna follow the remote.
[Rob throws remote into the Void. Gumball walks forward as if to strangle Rob, pauses, faces towards the Void and prepares to jump. He runs but stops quickly after noticing the height]
Gumball: That's pretty high... Maybe, just...
[Gumball crouches down and starts climbing down the entrance as Rob watches nonchalantly. Eventually, Gumball is barely hanging on by his fingers]
Gumball: Darn it— [His fingers slip] Aaaaaaah!
[As Gumball falls, Rob walks up and grabs the sides of the entrance]
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Goodbye. [Closes the entrance]
To Be Continued
[The credits start to roll on the other side with the music warped. The music fades away as the remote falls. Gumball grabs it and mashes the buttons repeatedly to make it work. Then he flips the remote to reveal that the batteries were out of place]
Gumball: What...?! Yes! [Pushes the batteries back in place]
[Gumball hits a rock, knocking the remote to the side. He tries to reach it and eventually ends up pressing the "Rewind" button which sends him back through the episode when he fought with Rob, then lost Penny and his family, and finally to the beginning. The episode ends with a "To Be Continued" title card]
