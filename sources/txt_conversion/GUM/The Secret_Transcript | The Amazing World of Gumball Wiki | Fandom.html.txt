Trapped in the Bathroom
[The scene starts out showing the door of the boys' bathroom. Gumball and Darwin are yelling for help and banging on the door]
Gumball: Help!
Darwin: We can't get out!
Gumball: Please, help! We're locked in!
Darwin: Please, let us out!
[Gumball stops yelling and sighs]
Gumball: It's no use, Darwin. We're gonna be stuck in here forever.
[Both slide down the wall to a sitting position]
Gumball: [Annoyed] It's the last time I come in here to whistle for you.
Darwin: But if you don't whistle, I can't go!
Gumball: [Sighs] I never thought it would end like this. Stuck in a bathroom forever.
Darwin: At least we've had some pretty good times.
Gumball: And some crummy ones too.
[Brief silence]
Gumball: Look, Darwin, if we don't get out of here, there's something I need to tell you. [Inhales] Remember that time I found a creepy picture in your schoolbook and you said you didn't do it?
[Flashback of saddened Darwin in a classroom with Miss Simian and Mr. Small looking at Darwin's book amazed, before looking at Darwin, then back to the book]
Gumball: Well... That was me.
Darwin: [Outraged] What?! I had to go to counseling for that! I lost my whole summer!
Gumball: I'm sorry, dude.
Darwin: Mr. Small put me in the isolation tank!
Gumball: Well, let's not dwell on the past.
[Darwin shakes his head in annoyance, before suddenly becoming wide eyed]
Darwin: Gumball, there's something I haven't told you too, and it's probably gonna shock you.
Gumball: What? Is it really bad or something?
Darwin: It's pretty bad, yeah. Last week—
[Rocky opens the door, interrupting Darwin]
Rocky: Oh, man, I'm so glad it's you! I thought this place was haunted by a couple of screaming girls!
Gumball and Darwin: [Run around] We're saved!
Gumball: How long have we been here?
Rocky: About three minutes.
[Gumball and Darwin exit the bathroom]
Gumball: Oh, uh, wait, what were you going to say back there, by the way?
Darwin: Huh?
Gumball: You were going to say something, remember?
Darwin: Ohh, don't worry about that now. We're free!
[Gumball looks worried and stops walking]
That Little Secret
[The living room. Gumball and Darwin are playing Kebab Fighter against each other]
Darwin: I love this game, it's so much fun!
Gumball: Yep! [brief silence] Hey, you know what else was fun? When we were stuck in the bathroom together and you were gonna tell me that secret!
Darwin: Yeah, that was fun.
Gumball: Just out of curiosity, what was that little secret?
Darwin: It's better you don't know.
Gumball: Sure... but I told you mine, therefore I think it's fair you tell me yours.
Darwin: Nah, let's just play instead.
Gumball: [Annoyed] Yeah, let's just play...
[Gumball's character starts hitting Darwin's character consecutively, without Darwin being able to block any]
Gumball: [Thinking] Look at him standing there, knowing his secret. I'll get it out of him if it's the last think I do!
Darwin: Wow, you're pretty good at this!
[Gumball rapidly spams the controller. His character knocks out Darwin's. "End It" appears on the screen while Gumball's character spawns a large mallet. The character then proceeds to smash Darwin's character into the ground. "Gumball Wins" is displayed on the screen, ending the game. Suddenly, Gumball's character starts repetitively smashing Darwin's character uncontrollably with the mallet. Gumball is angrily hitting the buttons on his controller. Darwin looks wide-eyed at the screen, then at Gumball]
Flaming Torture
[Darwin is sitting at the dining table. Gumball comes on-screen with a plate of baked beans and mashed potato, which he gives to Darwin]
Gumball: There you go, old pal!
Darwin: What's the occasion?
Gumball: Can't a guy just make a meal for his best buddy?
Darwin: This hasn't got anything to do with the secret, has it?
Gumball: Secret? No. What secret?
Darwin: Hmm... [Starts eating] You're giving me this food so I'll tell you the secret, aren't you?
Gumball: [Sly voice] Am I?
Darwin: Are you? [Begins gasping due to the intense spicy flavor from the food Gumball gave and Darwin's skin turns red as he is likely "burning"] Did you do something to this food?
Gumball: [Sly voice] I don't know. Did I?
Darwin: [Exhales smoke as his mouth begins burning, then begins mumbling] I need water! I need water now! I need water!!
Gumball: Sorry, excuse me?
[Darwin jumps above Gumball to get water from the tap, but the tap itself is tightened by Gumball to prevent Darwin from getting water]
Gumball: Tap's are a little tight, eh? [Swings a wrench, indicating that he tightened the tap]
[Darwin then runs to open the fridge to get any available drink, but the only items are  mustard, garlic, cactus, chili, and hot sauce]
Gumball: Looks like we're all out of drinks. Oh, wait, what's this? [Shows a glass of milk to Darwin, but pulls back as Darwin tries to get it] You want it?
Darwin: [Mumbles] I want it! I want it!!
Gumball: What's the secret? [Darwin shakes his head, refusing] Oh well... [Begins running away from Darwin to prevent him from getting the milk, Darwin also starts to chase Gumball]
[Gumball continues to taunt Darwin with the glass of milk and pulls back in various movements to torture him. In a few seconds, Gumball finally puts the glass of milk on the floor as Darwin drags himself across the floor. As he starts to take the glass, Gumball grabs the glass and puts it slightly further to further torture Darwin. Finally, Darwin can't handle the torture any longer]
Darwin: [Mumbles] Alright! Alright! Alright! [Falls down and his open-wide mouth starts flaming]
Gumball: Oh man... [Picks up the glass and splashes milk into Darwin's mouth to put out the fire. Darwin's skin goes back to normal]
Darwin: Thanks, Gumball!
Gumball: [Sighs] You're welcome.
Special Winner
[Gumball is currently calling someone inside phone booth]
Gumball: [Fake female voice] Uh, hello! Is uh... Darwin Watterson there, please?
Richard: [Suspiciously] Is this a telemarketer?
Gumball: Uh, no. It's a recorded message.
Richard: Oh, okay. [Calls Darwin with a weird tone] Darwin, tele-phooone... [Darwin arrives and gives him the telephone]
Darwin: Hello!
Gumball: Congratulations! You've been selected to win a special prize!
Darwin: [Over phone] Coooooooool!
Gumball: Just answer this one question correctly! When you were locked in the bathroom, what were you going to tell Gumball?
Darwin: [cheers] Oh oh! I know this one! I know this one! I'm gonna win a competition, Mr. Dad!
Richard: Wow! What's the prize?
Darwin: I don't know. [To the phone] What's the prize?!
Gumball: It's uh... vouchers. For beauty spa.
Darwin: [Disappointed] It's spa vouchers.
Richard: At last! A manicure!
[Suddenly the call is interrupted by a voice informing Gumball to insert 25 cents to continue using the phone]
Phone Voice: Please insert twenty-five cents to continue your call.
[Gumball tries to find a quarter to continue, but finds nothing]
Gumball: Ah! Ah-ah! Come on! G-give me your answer!
Richard: Ooh! Ask them if they can do a foot massage and will they do my roots.
Darwin: [Sighs] Can you do a foot massage—
Gumball: [Angry] Give me the answer!!
Darwin: Okay. The answer is— [Call ends]
Gumball: Noooooooo! No! No! Yaaaaaaaaaah! [Pants] Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Mind Reading
[Gumball and Darwin are sitting at a table. Darwin is drawing a picture, and Gumball is sitting across from him]
Gumball: [Thinking] Ahh, I've got to find out that secret. Hm, maybe I should try reading his mind. [Starts straining, bugging his eyes out and stretching his face in an effort to read Darwin's mind]
Darwin: [Puts his hands on his hips] Are you trying to read my mind?
Gumball: [In a strained voice] I don't know. Are you thinking "my face really hurts?"
Darwin: No.
Gumball: Then I wasn't.
[Gumball's face falls, then slowly retracts, eventually appearing to be sunk into his head. Darwin resumes his drawing]
A Pressuring Dream
[Camera close-up to Darwin's face, sleeping in his fish bowl. Inside Darwin's dream, he is swimming in the ocean. He sees a shrimp sitting on a rock]
Shrimp: [Crying]
[Darwin approaches the crying shrimp]
Darwin: What's the matter, little shrimp?
Shrimp: I'm sad because my best friend won't tell me his secret.
Darwin: [Patting the shrimp] Sometimes even best friends have to have a secret.
Shrimp: [In an angry tone] Did you have secrets?!
Darwin: Uh... Only one.
Shrimp: Well maybe if you tell me that, I would feel less sad.
Darwin: But I can't tell you.
Shrimp: Please, Darwin. Please tell me your secret.
Sea Creatures: Tell us your secret, Darwin...
Catfish: Tell me your secret, Darwin.
Darwin: What are you?
Catfish: I'm a catfish.
Darwin: But don't catfish live in fresh water, like rivers and streams?
Catfish: Dude, it's a dream. I mean you're sweating underwater.
[Darwin wipes his sweat]
Catfish: [Shouts] NOW TELL ME YOUR SECRET!!
[Darwin gasps as he wakes up from his dream, cutting to Gumball eagerly begging for Darwin to tell his secret to him]
Gumball: Tell me your secret! Tell me your... [Interrupted] Oh, hey, Darwin.
Darwin: What are you doing?
Gumball: Just helping you sleep. See?
[Gumball caresses Darwin's fish bowl as Darwin looks at him in annoyance]
Desperate Gumball
[Cut to the dining room. Darwin is drawing, while Gumball keeps begging Darwin for his secret]
Gumball: [Depressed] Darwin, just tell me your secret.
Darwin: No.
Anais: What secret?
Darwin: You know...
Anais: Oh, that secret. [Giggles]
Gumball: [Surprised] What?! You know too? Come on, Anais! I'm your big brother. Please, please, please tell me.
Anais: Sorry, Gumball, but I won't. It's for your own good.
Gumball: Fine. If that's the way you wanna play, I'll just have to get it out of you.
[Gumball starts poking Anais' head]
Gumball: Come on, come on, come on, come on, tell me, tell me, tell me, I know you're gonna tell me, you might as well tell me now, tell me now—
[Scene cuts to the bedroom. Anais is doing her homework and Gumbal is still poking her]
Gumball: —tell me now, tell me now, tell me now, you know I'm gonna break you, sis, you might as well tell me now, you're gonna break, this is gonna break you, tell me now.
[Gumball is still poking Anais' head in the bathroom while washing their teeth]
Gumball: Tell me now, tell me now, tell me now, come on, Anais, come on, Anais.
[Scene cuts inside the bus. Gumball is still going]
Gumball: Tell me now, tell me now, put it down, lay it down, fess it up.
Anais: [Annoyed] You do that one more time...
[Gumball pokes Anais for the last time]
Trapped in the Bathroom Again
[The school lockers. Gumball, with a beaten-up face, approaches Darwin]
Gumball: Hey, I've been talking with Anais and she told me everything, so it's okay to talk about it now.
Darwin: She didn't, did she?
Gumball: [Sighs] No...
Darwin: Look, Gumball. When we were in the bathroom, we thought it was gonna be the end. So unless we're in that situation again, I don't think I can ever tell you.
Gumball: That's it!
Darwin: What?
Gumball: What? What are you talking about "what"?
[Cut to the boys' bathroom where Gumball locks the door and slide the key outside through the gap below the door]
Gumball: There. Locked in. Now tell me your secret.
Darwin: Fine. But don't go crying about it. [Inhales] You know last week when you made me that sandwich and I said it was "great"?
Gumball: Uh huh, uh huh.
Darwin: Well, it was just "good"! [Cries]
Gumball: What?! Is that it?!
Darwin: I knew you'd react like this.
Gumball: I spent all this time, trying to get it out of you, and that was it?! A sandwich?!
Darwin: I'm so sorry, Gumball. Look, let's just get out of here. [Tries to open the door Gumball has locked] Come on. Come on!
Gumball: Darwin, I locked it.
Darwin: HELP! HELP!
Gumball: ROCKY! WE'RE LOCKED IN THE BATHROOM!
[Cut to Rocky mopping the floor and listening to a French language lesson]
Voice: French module one. Peter Pineapple is having a blast at the discotheque.
Rocky: Pierre l'ananas s'éclate à la discothèque.
[Cut back to Gumball and Darwin]
Gumball: Oh man. What have I done? How we're gonna get out of here now?
Darwin: Ah! Let's swim out through the toilet!
[Brief pause]
Gumball: [Saddened] Whyyyyy?!
[Gumball sits above Darwin, which is now inside the toilet. Then Gumball flushes and both of them slides down. Rocky unlocks the door]
Rocky: [Pronouncing incorrectly] Hello ? Y a-t-il quelqu'un ? [Subtitles: "Hello? Is anybody here?"; brief pause] Meh.
Misunderstanding
[Cut to a sewer where Gumball and Darwin have landed]
Gumball: Now what?
Darwin: Don't worry. We'll be perfectly fine, as long as the system don't get flushed out.
[Moments later, a huge wave fills the sewer and hits Gumball and Darwin. They go through a series of pipes]
Gumball: [Coughs] I can't believe we're in this mess because of you!
Darwin: Me?! I said no! But you forced me to tell you.
Gumball: Why would anyone hold on to such a trivial piece of information?
Darwin: You're the one who wanted to know.
Gumball: That's because you said it was really bad! I mean, you used the wrong adjective to describe a sandwich. Good, great, what's the difference?!
[Gumball and Darwin are swept into a dangerous hole, swim through a pipe, and end up in a water tank]
Darwin: Well, if it was just a big nothing, why don't you get over it?
Gumball: I am over it! But if I stop shouting, it'll look like I lost the argument! All I'm saying is I'm very sorry, please forgive me, and I love you!
Darwin: I love you too!
[Both eventually get stuck inside a bottle, which is on a conveyor belt among other bottles]
Gumball: [Sighs] Cool. Um, are we in a bottle of water?
Darwin: What? Does this mean the water we drink starts off in the toilet?
Pantsbully: What did ya think? It just falls outta the sky or somethin'?
Gumball: Sir, do you know the way to the Watterson house?
Pantsbully: Go back the way you came, and this time take a left at the school pipe.
The Real Secret
[Cut to Wattersons' house, then into the bathroom. Richard is washing his hands. Gumball and Darwin emerge from the toilet]
Richard: [Shocked] AHH! Did I ate you?
Gumball: No, we've been lost in the sewers.
Richard: Oh, thank goodness.
[Richard and Darwin come out, leaving Gumball inside]
Anais: Where's Gumball?
Darwin: He's taking a shower.
Anais: [Whispering] So, did you tell him the secret?
Darwin: No. He must never know that we accidentally uploaded that clip.
[Both of them laugh]
[The "Hip Flop" video clip that Darwin and Anais uploaded appears]
Gumball: [Sets web camera] Check this out.
[Gumball dances, then he loses his balances and destroys everything near him. The episode ends when the video clip shows the view count over 961,264,966 views]
