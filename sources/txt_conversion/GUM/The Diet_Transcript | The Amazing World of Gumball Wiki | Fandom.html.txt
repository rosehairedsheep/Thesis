Food for Thought
[It is night-time at the Wattersons' house. Richard is in the kitchen, standing beside an open fridge and studying a book]
Richard: Hmm. Hm.
[Gumball and Darwin enter from the living room]
Richard: Mmm...
Darwin: [To Gumball] What's going on? I've never seen Mr. Dad that confused by the fridge before.
Gumball: Yeah, it's the only appliance in the house that he actually knows how to use.
Richard: Kids, where would I find the "sa-lard?"
Gumball: You mean salad.
Darwin: It's in the drawer at the bottom of the fridge.
Richard: There's a drawer in the fridge?!
[Skeptical, Richard puts the book on top of the fridge, kneels, and opens the crisper]
Richard: [Gasps, then whispers] I thought we agreed no secrets.
[He glowers at the fridge while removing a bag of lettuce, which he slams on the counter]
Richard: Hmph! [Affectionately] Oh, who am I kidding? I still love you. [Kisses the fridge door; Puts a single lettuce leaf on a plate] Dinner is served.
Gumball: I'm impressed. You're really taking this diet thing seriously.
Richard: Sure I am. [Carries the plate to the dining room] My book says if you use tiny plates, you eat less.
Gumball: Um, that only works if you have one tiny plate.
[The table is shown to be laden with all manner of food]
Gumball: [Puzzled] What diet is this?
Richard: [Pointing to the various food items ] Well, that's the no-carbs diet. That's the high-protein diet. That's the five-two diet, that's the two-five diet. That's the—
[The doorbell rings]
Larry: [Off-screen] Pizza delivery!
Gumball: And that?
Richard: My reward for dieting.
[Next morning, Gumball and Darwin are at the table eating Daisy Flakes. Richard, who is noticeably fatter than before, walks up behind them]
Darwin: Hey, Mr. Dad, I like your new roll-neck sweater.
Richard: I'm not wearing a roll-neck.
Gumball: [Awkwardly] Oh. It's your, uh, actual neck roll. Are you sure this diet's working?
Richard: Absolutely. I feel incredible. It's given me so much energy.
Gumball: Yeah, you did just sleep for thirty-six hours.
Richard: [Gasps] That means I missed a whole day's eating! [Checks the fridge, which is empty] Hmm, it's weird. Since I started dieting, we've run out of food so quickly. I have to go buy groceries every day. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. Hmm. [Thinks] That's it! I should get the groceries delivered!
[Gumball and Darwin groan. Richard sets up a laptop on the table, types something, and closes the lid]
Richard: Done!
[The three sit in silence for a moment, then Richard taps his fingers impatiently]
Richard: Let's go to the grocery store.
Darwin: But you just ordered a whole load of food.
Richard: I've got to have something to eat in the meantime, don't I? Chewing is one of the best ways to burn calories.
[Gumball and Darwin are buckled into the backseat of their car. A loud thump, occurring at regular intervals, is causing the entire vehicle to tremble]
Gumball: [Sighs] It's taking him forever.
[Straining himself, Richard makes it around the hood and squeezes into the driver's seat. When he reaches for the seatbelt, the car tips onto its side]
Gumball: Uh, Dad? I don't think this diet's working.
Secret Stash
[Back inside, Richard is collapsed on the living room couch, with Gumball and Darwin standing nearby]
Gumball: Okay, Darwin and I are going to help you diet properly.
Richard: What do you know about dieting?
Gumball: [Scoffs] The Internet exists. We don't need to "know" anything.
Darwin: We will be your thin-spiration.
Gumball: Your slim-presarios.
Darwin: Your—
Gumball: Okay, I think he gets it.
Darwin: [Dejected] Hm.
Gumball: Now, if you want to take this seriously, you need to be open and honest about what you eat.
Darwin: Do you have any food in the house we don't know about?
Richard: Uhhh...
Gumball: Dad!
Richard: I thought that would throw you guys off.
Gumball: Hmm.
[Gumball picks up the TV remote and discovers two sausages in the battery slot. Him and Darwin then proceed to search the house, finding Swiss cheese in the bathroom, a sandwich disguised as the phone, sliced meat in the photo album, some pizza in a record sleeve, a cookie in a computer DVD tray, and fried chicken under a lampshade. They confront their father in the kitchen, where Darwin swipes the banana he is using for a necktie]
Darwin: That's not so bad.
Gumball: Wait a minute.
[He peels the banana to reveal a corn cob, which he in turn peels to uncover a corn dog. Darwin holds it up to Richard, accusingly]
Darwin: Hm.
Richard: [Ashamed] Mmm.
Gumball: That's it, we're putting you in lockdown! Somewhere where there's no food.
[Gumball is in his bedroom, monitoring security footage on the computer screen. He is communicating with Darwin, who is in the backyard, via walkie-talkie]
Gumball: Fish Finger, do you copy? I repeat, Fish Finger, do you copy?
Darwin: All quiet here. I repeat, all quiet here, Night Towel.
Gumball: Ugh! It's Night Owl. Wait, I'm picking up some interference here.
[The video feed shows Richard in the supply shed with his back to the camera]
Gumball: Sounds like... chewing. What's he doing in there? I can't make it out. Do you see anything?
[Darwin climbs the side of the shed and looks in the window. He squints in order to figure out what Richard is holding]
Darwin: [Gasps] He has a burger! Repeat, he has a burger!
Gumball: You're gonna have to go in. And, Darwin? Be careful.
[Darwin opens the door to a seemingly vacant shed. Near the back, there is a lone stool with the burger sitting on it]
Darwin: Mr. Dad? [Gasps] He's gone!
Gumball: But that's impossible! What can you see?
Darwin: [Approaches the stool; Picks up a bundle of clothes] Oh, my gosh! The hamburger's fake!
Gumball: It must be a trap! Get out of there! Abort! Abort!
[From above, a viscous liquid drips onto Darwin's head. He looks up at Richard, who is clinging to the ceiling. As Richard hisses, more of the liquid falls from his mouth and onto Darwin's face. He screams and frantically tries to wipe it off]
Darwin: [Calmly] Oh. It's just saliva. [Resumes panic] Ew-ew-ew-ew-ew! He's escaped!
Gumball: FRIDGE!
[Gumball and Darwin watch their father disapprovingly, as he gorges himself on the contents of the refrigerator]
Darwin: [Shudders] This is a new low.
Gumball: Meh, feels like a very familiar low.
Darwin: Dad moves so fast when there's food involved.
Gumball: [Grins slyly] Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Gumball and Darwin: We use food to trick Dad into exercising!
Gumball: Huh, that never usually works.
Richard: [Stands up behind them] You probably shouldn't have said your plan out loud right in front of me.
Gumball: [Fearfully whispers] Don't worry, his short-term memory is terrible.
Richard: So, what are we talking about?
Gumball: There it is.
Flab to Fab
[Richard is running on the sidewalk while chasing after pieces of candy. Up ahead, Gumball is on the back of a bicycle, peddled by Darwin, dropping said candy]
Gumball: It's working! But it feels like something's missing.
Darwin: Training wheels?
[They immediately fall over]
Gumball: Nah, we're too old for them.
[The animation rewinds, bringing the bike upright again]
Darwin: Synth rock and cross-fades?
[Gumball nods approvingly; Music plays during a montage of Richard performing various exercises, while Gumball and Darwin provide the figurative carrot on a stick]
Music: Feel the heat when your heart's on fire. Burn it up, let it take you higher. Tearin' down the walls that cage your mind. [Repeats]
[Partway through, they replace the junk food with healthier alternatives, and the workout continues. The song ends with Richard having successfully lost weight, and the three celebrate on the front porch]
Gumball: [High-fives Darwin] Woo-hoo!
[The brothers enter the living room, but Richard remains outside]
Gumball: Ahh, I knew all we needed to get Dad fit was a montage.
Darwin: Yeah! And quick, too! It was under a minute.
[The song carries on in the background]
Gumball: [Sighs] That tune is so annoying. Still got it going around in my head.
Darwin: Me, too.
[Gumball opens the door; The music gets louder]
Darwin: Oh, he's still montaging.
Gumball: I'm sure he'll tire himself out soon.
[The next day, Gumball and Darwin are asleep in their bedroom when they are awoken by a commotion outside]
Gaylord: [Honking the horn] Hey, get off of my car! Get out of the way, Watterson!
[Gumball and Darwin look out from the window. Down on the street, an overly muscular and shirtless Richard is posing on the front of Mr. Robinson's vehicle]
Gaylord: Get out of the way of my car!
Richard: That's right, buddy. Honk if you think I'm tonk.
Gumball: [Humorless] Oh, look. We've created a monster.
Darwin: Yeah, a really ripped one.
Richard: Say, which one of you two fine specimens is coming with me to the mall? People there are gonna wanna see me with my shirt off. [Flexes]
Gumball: [Nervous] Yeah, uh, I think we're gonna stay home.
Richard: I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to these babies.
[Richard kisses his biceps while photographing himself with a cellphone]
Gaylord: Aw, for cryin' out loud!
[Mr. Robinson backs his car up, then drives into Richard, carrying him away on top of the hood]
Gumball: [Sighs] We have to follow him.
Darwin: 'Cause he's a danger to himself?
Gumball: No, because there's a danger he'll embarrass us.
Vanity Insanity
[Mr. Robinson's car screeches to a halt in the Elmore Mall parking lot. Richard slides off and rolls into position for another photo]
Richard: Thanks for the lift.
Gaylord: Bah, I was tryin' to run you over.
[Gumball and Darwin are racing to the mall on foot]
Gumball: How are we gonna know where he is?!
Darwin: [Checking his phone] Don't worry, he's selfie-ing now. He updates his profile picture every five seconds. We can work it out from that. [Shows the screen to Gumball] See? Look at those puppies.
Gumball: [Covers his eyes] Ah, I don't wanna see that! [Peeks at an image of Richard holding two dog pups] Oh. Not what I expected. That means he's at the pet store!
Darwin: Oh! Now he's at the nursery. [The phone chimes again] What's he doing now?!
[Richard is at the food court, taking a selfie, when Hexagon Lady taps his shoulder]
Hexagon lady: Uh, excuse me? I'm really sorry to bother you, but—
Richard: Hah, it's quite alright. I get this all the time. [Puts his arm around her] I'm ready for you to take my picture.
Hexagon lady: [Uneasy] Umm...
Richard: Don't worry, I've got this. [Snaps a photo]
Hexagon lady: Uh, actually, um...
Richard: [Releases her] Wait, I'll just tag it. [Types] "Chillin' with my fans."
Hexagon lady: Yeah, I just wanted to see if you were using this chair?
Richard: [Spins the chair around and sits down] You mean this chair?
Hexagon lady: You know what? Don't worry about it. [Walks away, irritated]
Richard: [Lies on a table] You could take this table if you like.
Hexagon lady: Yeah, uh, never mind.
[She heads off-screen as Richard takes another picture. Gumball and Darwin arrive at the mall]
Gumball: Where is he?!
Darwin: [Looks at his cellphone; Gasps] He's in Paris?! London? New Jersey?
Gumball: Oh, he's at the travel agents, by the fountain! Come on!
[Next to the fountain, Alan kisses a coin at the end of his string]
Alan​​​: I wish for a world in which everyone can live together in peace and harmony. [Tosses the coin in the water]
Richard: [Gasps] Don't worry, kid! I'll rescue that coin!
[He leaps up and dives into the fountain, then emerges and shakes off some water. His fur glows from the backlighting, as Delibes' "Flower Duet" is heard in the background]
Hot Dog Guy​​​: How is he doing that?
Alison: And why?
[Richard grabs a water bottle from a passerby and pours it out over his body, after which he returns the coin to Alan]
Richard: Be more careful next time, big guy. [Steps off-screen]
Alan​​​: Uhh, thanks? [Disheartened] I guess that means no world peace.
[Gumball and Darwin reach the fountain]
Gumball: [Panting] Where did he go?!
Darwin: [Pulls out his phone] The parking lot!
Feel the Heat
[In the parking garage, Richard is strutting toward the camera with a rubber tire in each hand as upbeat music plays]
Music: Work it, work it. Put your back into it now. I'm gonna make that body work, make that body work—
Bandage Paramedic: [Exits the nearby ambulance] Hey, buddy, where ya goin' with my tires?!
[Richard runs off, taking the tires with him]
Bandage Paramedic: Hey, stop! That guy has to be stopped!
[Gumball and Darwin enter the garage]
Bandage Paramedic: I mean, his abs are phenomenal, but he has got to be stopped!
Ambulance Radio: We have a fire on West Elmore Boulevard. Wait, there's a guy, he's taking the hose. Sir, he's... he's posing with the hose! Sir, sir?!
Darwin: [Hesitant] Uh, m-maybe it's not him?
Ambulance Radio: Look at the size of those biceps!
Gumball: Yeah, it's definitely him.
[At the scene of the fire, Richard has the hose wrapped around his shoulder. His back to the burning house, he is showing off to the gathered crowd and firemen]
Hank: Sir, for pity's sake, I need the hose to put out the fire!
Karen: There might be people in there!
George: He stole my helmet! [The crowd angrily scowls at him]
Mike: [To the viewer] You join us here as our brave fire department are prevented from doing their job by a local jerk.
[A siren wails; Doughnut Sheriff drives up and gets out of the police cruiser]
Donut Sheriff: Sir, stop posing with the fire hose or I'll have to use this! [Readies his taser]
[Richard ignores him and takes yet another selfie]
Donut Sheriff: I warned you! [He tases Richard, then becomes awestruck] Oh, my gosh! It's just making his abs more defined.
Karen: Magnificent!
Hank: Everything we try just makes him more beautiful.
George: You'd feel so safe in those arms.
[Gumball and Darwin appear, ducking under the barricade]
Darwin: [Yelling] Dad, stop!
Gumball: You're taking this too far! You've become vain! Remember what's important to you! What means more to you than anything else?
Darwin: Yes, remember your family!
Gumball: No, food! Remember food!
["Remember food!" echoes; Richard turns to the onlookers and sees them eating various snacks. He stumbles back, overwhelmed by his memories, and falls to the ground. The hose is ripped from the hydrant, and the resulting spray of water douses the flames]
Mike: You join us here as a local hero has put out a house fire without the aid of our useless fire department. Who needs firemen, anyway?
[Richard, Gumball, and Darwin are standing by an ambulance]
Richard: I'm sorry, kids. I guess I went a bit too far. Let me make it up to you. Who wants pizza? And after that, we can go for Mexican. And after that, we can go for Chinese. Oh, and we should get a burrito too, and maybe some ice cream.
[The three stroll into the distance]
Richard: You know what? I could also really go for a taco right now. There's this place I know where they toast the tacos first. Then, maybe a burger.
[The episode ends]
