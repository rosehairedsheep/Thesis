Today's Gonna Be a Wonderful Day!
[The episode begins at the Wattersons' house hallway, morning, Anais, Nicole, Darwin, and Richard are lined up waiting at the bathroom door; Anais yanks Nicole's bathrobe]
Nicole: Anais, for the last time, we just can't afford it.
Anais: [Teary-eyed] But why?
Nicole: [Sighs] Richard, tell your daughter why we can't go to Daisyland.
Richard: We're going to Daisyland?!
Nicole: No!
Richard: [Teary-eyed] But why?
Nicole: Because money doesn't grow on trees, and Daisyland tickets don't just fall from the sky.
Darwin: But you always say that if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.
Richard: [Straining]
Anais: Dad, what are you doing?
Richard: [Puts hands on head] I'm getting tickets using the power of my mind.
Anais: That's not gonna—
Richard: Shh! [Straining]
[Darwin does the same thing as Richard]
Darwin: [Straining]
Anais: I hate to break it to you guys, but it's not gonna happen, the world doesn't work like that.
Nicole: [Sighs] Gumball Watterson! Get out of this bathroom!
[The scene cuts to the bathroom, Gumball is in the shower]
Gumball: Today's gonna be a wonderful day, because I got in the shower first! La la la la la la la la la la— [The shower stops, Gumball takes a look] Huh?
[Gumball pushes the tiling, causing a clunk, he then looks right at the shower head, which then shoots out a water jet]
Gumball: Aaah!
[Gumball slips on the soap bar in the shower, rips the shower curtain off, falls out of the tub, and lands in the toilet. The bar of soap then flies off and pushes the toilet's handle, causing Gumball to get flushed down]
[Later, Gumball pushes the cover of a manhole off, and gets out in the middle of the road, covered in sewage]
Gumball: Ahhhhhh...
[The school bus goes up]
Darwin and Anais: Hey, wait for us!
Anais: Wait for us!
Gumball: [Hops on one leg with his pants] Rocky! Ugh, ugh, ugh... [Pulls up pants] Wait for me—
[Gumball jumps up, but gets his finger stuck in bus door]
Gumball: [High-pitched] Ow!
[The bus goes off, dragging Gumball with it]
Gumball: Uh, Rocky? ROCKYY!!
At School
[The scene then cuts to the outside of the school. The bus passes by, still dragging Gumball]
Gumball: Ow! Ugh! Ugh! Ow!
[Gumball hits a pole, and his arm stretches, then the finger finally comes out of the door, but Gumball's arm swings back and hits him in the face]
Gumball: Aghh. [Gets up and dusts himself off] Well, it seems like it's just not my day, but that's ok, because it's nothing a good song won't fix! [Singing] When life hands you lemons, you gotta make some lemonaaaade... [Breathes in, about to sing louder, but is stepped on by Hector]
[In the school hallways, Darwin is still straining with his hands on his head]
Anais: Darwin, stop it already, it's getting embarrassing.
Gumball: [Still on Hector's feet, being pushed against the floor as Hector walks] Agh! Ow! Ow! [Comes off Hector's foot, flat as a pancake, and his clothes are ripped and torn]
Darwin: Gumball! How's it going?
Gumball: Ah, it's great... EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THIS IS STARTING OUT TO BE THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE! [Gets up] It's like I'm cursed or something.
Nigel Brown: Watterson! This school has a dress code. These rags are obscene! Get to the Lost and Found, they'll provide you with something more suitable.
Gumball: But Principal Brown—
Nigel Brown: Uhp!
[Gumball sighs]
The Lost and Found
Rocky: There you go, much better.
Gumball: [Wearing only a pair of green swim trunks] You've gotta be kidding me.
Rocky: I'm sorry, dude, but this isn't the department store you know.
Gumball: [Whispering] Ugh, Rocky, there's gotta be something else.
Rocky: [Rummages through box] You're in luck! [Places a pink fedora on Gumball's head]
Gumball: Ughhh! [Walks away in anger]
[In the school hallways, some students are talking. As Gumball walks through, all the students look at him. Tobias drops his books and gasps]
Banana Joe: Eh, some people think I'm a fruit, but I'm also classified as a herb.
[Idaho gasps]
Banana Joe: [Quietly] What?
[Gumball walks in; Banana Joe and Idaho laugh at him]
Banana Joe: Where did you get your clothes, the Lost and Found?! Hahaha!
Gumball: Well, actually, yes, I did.
Banana Joe: Ohh, where did you get your clothes, the circus?! Haha!
Gumball: Dude, we kinda just went over this already. Lost and Found.
Banana Joe: Where did you get your clothes, the swim shop and the hat shop?! Hahaha!
Gumball: [Enraged] NNRRGH! [Principal Brown opens the door] WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR BRAIN FROM, THE DOLLAR STORE?! [Sees Principal Brown and is shocked]
[Banana Joe and Idaho walk away; Gumball smiles nervously at Principal Brown]
Nigel Brown: Seven hours detention, for hurting my feelings.
Gumball: WHAT?! But—
Nigel Brown: [Hands over a pink sheet] I'll see you after school.
Gumball: FINE! [Takes sheet] OW, PAPERCUT!
[Principal Brown reenters the room. Gumball starts crying soon afterwards]
Darwin: Uh, Gumball, are you okay?
Gumball: Everything's great, Darwin, [Sniffs] everything's just peachy.
Darwin: Oh, okay!
Gumball: DARWIN, don't take everything I say so literally!
Darwin: Okaaay, what about what you just said now, should I take that literally?
Gumball: No. Yes. No. I don't knowohohohoh... [Starts crying again]
Darwin: [Grabs Gumball's cheeks] Talk to me.
Gumball: [Sniffs] I think I'm cursed.
Darwin: Hmm, then what you need is a good luck charm.
Anais: Guys, there are no such things as lucky charms, curses, or tickets falling from the sky, there must be a scientific explanation for what's happening to Gumball, like there is for everything!
Darwin: Oh yeah? How does your science explain the magic of rainbows then, huh?
Anais: Diffraction of light through moisture in the atmosphere.
Darwin: It's a sad world you live in. Come on, Gumball. [Walks away with Gumball]
At the School Field
[Gumball and Darwin are looking for lucky clovers]
Gumball: Darwin, how will I know if it's a four-leaf clover?
Darwin: Simple! They've got four leaves and are extremely rare.
Gumball: Rare?
Darwin: They're one in a million! Rarer then the rarest— Found one!
Clover: Top of the morning to ya!
Gumball and Darwin: Oooooo!
[Darwin hands Gumball the clover]
Gumball: I can already feel my luck changing. [A football is thrown near him, he picks it up] Hey look! A lucky foo— [He gets kicked by a player, and hits a goalpost, which then falls on him]
Lunchtime
[Gumball walks over and sits at the table Anais is at]
Gumball: I'm ready to take your advice now.
Anais: I knew you'd come around eventually.
Gumball: Now please help me, WHAT'S THE SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION FOR ALL OF THIS?!
Anais: Oh, there's no explanation, what's been happening is just a coincidental series of unfortunate events.
Gumball: Huh?
Anais: Look, I'm just going to have to show you.
At the Gym
[Anais has set up a ladder, a mirror, and an umbrella]
Anais: Ok, opening an umbrella indoors, breaking a mirror, and walking under a ladder are all considered to bring extremely bad luck. Ha, nonsense, and to prove it, you're going to perform all three tasks at the same time!
Gumball: You sure about this?
Anais: Mathematically, the chance of anything else happening to you, is miniscule.
Gumball: Ohhkay! [Inhales] Here it goes!
[Gumball grabs the umbrella, hits the mirror and breaks it, opening the umbrella, then runs under the ladder]
Gumball: Wow, I guess you were right!
[A storm cloud appears over Gumball and thundershocks him, turning him into a pile of ashes, and dissappears]
Anais: I guess logic and reason just went down the drain.
Darwin: Hey guys, guys! I've been thinking scientifically, and I think I've figured it out! Yesterday evening, Gumball and I were setting the table for dinner...
[A flashback plays showing the house's dining area, Gumball and Darwin walk up to the table with plates, glasses, and silverware, and a vase. Gumball slips on a rollerskate, and all the dinnerware falls on the table without a scratch, then Darwin places a flower in the vase]
Gumball and Darwin: Wow.
[Back to present time]
Darwin: It was probably the luckiest thing I've ever seen. So, according to my findings, Gumball used up all his good luck in one day, and that's why today, he is left with nothing but bad luck!
Anais: [Inhales] That doesn't make sense, but it's the best we got. So the logical conclusion to your nonsensical theory, is that if he can survive today, everything should be normal by tomorrow!
Gumball: [Still a pile of ashes] Of course!
Detention
[Gumball sits down, smiling]
Nigel Brown: [Sharpens pencil, looks at the clock, and sighs] I'll be right back, Watterson, I've got some important business to attend to. [Walks out]
Gumball: What? No, don't leave me!
Nigel Brown: You're staying right there because you're in detention!
Gumball: No, you don't understand! I'm in great danger!
Nigel Brown: You're in great danger of getting another three hours detention!
Gumball: Principal Brown, please! [The ceiling lights begin to shake, Gumball whimpers, then looks at sharp pencils, he gulps] I gotta get out of here! No, wait, just do nothing, do nothing, just do... [Looks up, the lights have stopped shaking, Gumball sighs with relief]
Nigel Brown: [Looks in] Sorry, I forgot to slam the door in anger! [Slams the door]
[The slam makes the ceiling light fall down, hitting the pencil holder, which makes the pencils shoot out, Gumball ducks, and the pencils hit the class photo, in a circle around Gumball's head, Gumball whimpers in fear. A pencil falls down, hitting the button on a control, which makes the fan next to Gumball's seat start blowing, knocking the books on the windowsill, hitting a globe, causing it to fall over, hitting a vase, which then pours water onto an electrical socket, the electrical socket short circuits, and causes a burst of smoke, knocking the broken pieces of the socket plate to hit the radiator, filling the room with steam]
Gumball: Ok, I think I might go and do nothing somewhere else!
[School hallways, seconds later. Principal Brown is playing a portable game console]
Nigel Brown: I'm so glad I confiscated this. [Gumball sneaks out of the room] Watterson! What are you do--
[The room explodes, Gumball falls into a janitor's cart, which is then bursted forward. Gumball pops his head out of the water in the cart, and spits out water]
Gumball: Come on, bad luck, let's get this over with, give me your best shot!
The Run
[Gumball is thrown out of the exploding school, along with the cart]
Gumball: [Bounces on the street with the cart] Ow, ow, ow! [The cart falls down a hill] Ow, I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY!
[The cart falls on the highway. Gumball checks his body, happy that he survived]
Gumball: I'm alive!
[A car horn goes off, Gumball screams and tries to push a truck back with a mop, Gumball looks forward, a latch on another truck comes off, and tires come at Gumball]
Gumball: Ah, give me a break! [Dodges the tires] Ah, ah, ahhhahah!
[Gumball looks back, as the truck behind him runs into trees, knocking down a "chain" of powerlines. Gumball watches the powerlines fall down like dominos, then looks back, and sees the truck in front of him brake abrubtly, to avoid being crushed. Gumball screams, and ducks, going under the truck, Gumball's cart goes under a falling powerline right before it hits the ground]
Gumball: Hahahahahaha! In your FACE, bad luck! I am invincib- [Hits a sign with his head, then looks up, and sees the unfinished freeway, and screams] No, I can make this! [Accelerates by rowing the mop] I'm gonna make it! I'm gonna make it! I'm gonna make it! [Falls through the gap] I'm not gonna make it!
At Hospital
[Gumball wakes up in hospital, lying on a bed with his family watching him]
Gumball: Uh, ugh, what happened?
Nicole: The doctor said you were very lucky to survive, very lucky indeed.
Gumball: Uh? Lucky? This means my good luck has finally returned!
Darwin: Thus proving my scientific hypothesis to be correct.
Anais: And since science and reason have gone out the window, I suggest we all use the power of our minds to get tickets for Daisyland.
[Everyone puts their hands at their heads, making a straining sound]
Epilogue
[Daisyland, Tobias and Rachel's family are at the ticket window]
Harold​​​​​: One family pass to Daisyland, please. [The wind blows his ticket away] Oh, no, my ticket! Hmm, I wonder to where the wind will take it.
[Highway, the ticket goes into a truck-drivers windshield]
Pantsbully: Hey look, a Daisyland ticket! [The wind blows the ticket away] I wonder to where the wind will take it.
[The ticket flies into a plane's wing]
Boy: Look, Mother, a Daisyland ticket. [The wind blows the ticket away] Mother, I'm wondering to where the wind will take it.
[Hospital, the ticket blows into the window, and the Wattersons watch, until the fan cuts it into little pieces]
Darwin: Yay! I wished for snow!
