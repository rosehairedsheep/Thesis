Rampage Through Elmore
[Scene shows a normal neighbourhood somewhere in Elmore but the Watterson car pops out from one of the houses and continues into another house's front yard]
GPS: [Camera changes to the GPS on the car's windscreen] In twenty-five yards, turn left.
[Richard turns left, smashing through the fence. The sheer force of the turn, combined with the high speed, causes Darwin and Anais' colors to come off and splat on the car door. Scene changes to Gary who is trying to cross the road; the car runs over his right foot then smashes through another house and continues on a road]
Gumball: Dad, why do we have to go to school?
Richard: So you can get a job.
Gumball: But why do I need a job?
Richard: So you can earn money.
GPS: Continue ahead.
[The car smashes through "Danger" signs at the expressway]
Gumball: But why do I need money?
Richard: To buy the stuff that the TV makes us want.
[The car continues forward on an unfinished expressway and drops off]
Gumball: But why do I need to buy stuff?
[Camera changes to the inside of the car while it is free-falling]
Richard: Because if you didn't buy stuff, everyone would be out of a job and no one would have any money.
Gumball: Wait, so I have to work for the rest of my life to pay for stuff that I don't want, just so that everyone else can suffer the same horrible fate as me?
Richard: Exactly.
[The car drops to another expressway and continues on, a container truck horns and turns left, causing traffic accidents]
Gumball: You just live your life without thinking don't you?
Richard: I believe you are underestimating me, son.
GPS: Turn right.
[Richard turns right onto oncoming traffic, hits the guardrail and goes off the expressway. Richard stops the car in front of the school and one of the wheel rolls off]
GPS: You have reached your destination.
[Darwin and Anais are both panting and Darwin wipes some of his color on the car's door onto himself]
Gumball: Come on, surely there's more to life than that.
Richard: Hmmmmm nope.
Gumball: [Folds his arms in anger] Argh.
What's a TV?
[The schoolyard. Several students are gathered around Gumball]
Gumball: I'm outta here, enjoy your pathetic lives working from 9:00 to 5:00, Hector, send me to freedom!
[Hector sends Gumball in the air by stepping on the seesaw. Nothing happens for a while until Gumball falls back and faceplants into the ground]
Gumball: [Points at students] That's it, laugh at me but at least I'm not a mindless zombie going through life doing what they tell me to.
[Points at the sky]
Idaho: Who?
Gumball: You know, them!
Idaho: Who's them?
Gumball: You know, the man.
Idaho: What man?
Gumball: The man who tells you what to do!
Idaho: Who? My dad?
Gumball: No— ughh, the people who tell you what to watch on TV and stuff.
Idaho: What's...a TV?
Gumball: Its a— [Pauses] Hmmm.
The Way to Ultimate Happiness
[Scene changes to the front of the Wattersons' house and nothing happens for a while until Richard, in the car, drops onto the road]
GPS: You have reached your destination.
[Richard goes into the house with a box of chicken nuggets and french fries in one hand and a towel in another like a butler, walking to the dining table while Darwin is playing a video game]
Richard: [With French accent] On ze menu today, poulet à la deep fried, accompanied by le fries of the French. [Eats a french fry] Mmm, délicieux.
[Idaho taps repeatedly on Richard's leg]
Idaho: What are le fries of the French?
Richard: [Back in his normal voice] Are you a potato?
Idaho: [Slaps his leg] As sure as the world is flat!
[Richard turns around, camera changes to the front window where the box of chicken nuggets and french fries were thrown out, breaking the window]
Richard: Who's the bumpkin?
[Camera shows Nicole and Anais are seated down without chairs, floating, while Richard stands like a butler]
Nicole: This is Idaho, Gumball's friend from the country, he's gonna be staying with us this weekend.
Richard: Where's your chair?
Nicole: Gumball threw it away, we are getting rid of our possessions to lead a simpler, better life.
[Anais stops floating and drops onto the floor]
Richard: What's going on here?
Gumball: It's Idaho, he's gonna show us the way.
[Camera changes and shows Gumball preparing to pull the plug off the TV]
Richard: The way to what?
Gumball: The way to ultimate happiness.
Richard: Is that a theme park?
Gumball: No, it's a free world with no electricity, no cars, no supermarkets and especially no TV.
[Gumball pulls the plug and the TV switches off then Mozart's Requiem Mass in D minor - Lacrimosa plays as Richard, Nicole and Anais sheds a tear but camera zooms out showing Darwin laughing and sad music stops]
Darwin: [Laughs] He's not joking, is he?
[The music continues and Darwin sheds a tear]
Activities
[The Wattersons and Idaho are in the backyard. The family looks angrily at Gumball]
Gumball: [Relieved] Ahhh, isn't it better to simply communicate rather than being brainwashed by the TV?
Darwin: Dude, no one said a word for half an hour!
Richard: Nicole, punish Gumball for being boring!
Nicole: I really want to, but I can't. Gumball is exploring his outlook on society and it is our job as parents to encourage that no matter how much we might think it's [Angrily] COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS!
Gumball: [Nervously] Heh heh, so what do you noble savages do to entertain your tribe?
Idaho: We play rough and tumble.
Darwin: What's that?
Idaho: Come on, I will show you. [Walks to another part of the backyard and Darwin follows] Now the rules is there are no rules, you wrestle and make your friend tumble.
Darwin: Wait, so you can like punch and stuff?
Idaho: Well heh heh, well you can try but I have to warn you, I have never been defeated in Elmore County, come on.
[Darwin and Idaho prepares to wrestle each other]
Darwin: [Scared] Ahhhhh!
Idaho: AHHHHHHHHH! [Runs toward Darwin but Darwin kicks him to another backyard]
[Richard starts laughing while the rest of the family looks angrily at Darwin]
Nicole: Darwin!
Darwin: He said there were no rules!
Nicole: You didn't have to kick him over a house!
Darwin: I was defending myself!
Anais: Against what? You're like 8 times his size!
Darwin: I panicked, OK?
[Everybody looks angrily at Richard while he laughs and clap his hands]
Richard: Ha ha, do it again, do it again!
[Richard notices that everyone is glaring at him and stops laughing and clapping]
[Idaho has a plaster on his head while the Wattersons look nervous]
Idaho: You know what we do when we need to cheer up, we sing songs! [Clears throat] Aberdeen, in the wind! In the field, potato. Come on, altogether now.
[The Wattersons awkwardly sing along]
All: Aberdeen, in the wind! In the field, potato.
[Richard starts singing too loud and the rest of the Wattersons cover their ears]
Richard: Ahhhhhhhh! [Half of his front tooth breaks off] Ah!
Anais: I hope the tooth fairy accepts change.
Richard: That's it, I've had it with your "alternative new age nonsense", it started boring and now it's painful, I'm going to the chicken place and get a family bucket of comfort food.
Gumball: Look, we are at such freedom and it comes with a price, it's tough but it's beautiful, it's rough but it's real, it's dangerous but it's... it's—
Anais: It's a backyard, there is nothing dangerous around here. [A wasp flies in and she screams] Wasp!
[The Wattersons start panicking and jumping around while Darwin keeps blowing the wasp to Nicole]
Nicole: Darwin, don't blow it at me, blow it away!
Idaho: [Slaps his leg, amused] I have never seen this much dancing since they invented the mashed potato.
[Gumball drops out from Nicole's skirt]
Gumball: Calm down guys, it's just a tiny insect, I will show you how to handle it. [Points to wasp] Hey wasp, how about you just go— [Gets stung by the wasp] Owwww! What the— Owwww! That stung me like a million times!
[Gumball faints while the rest of the Wattersons continue panicking and the wasp flies away]
Idaho: Suck the poison out and you will be just fine.
[Gumball wakes up]
Gumball: Ya, chill out people, it's only a wasp sting. [Sucks the poison out from his finger] Just gonna suck the poison out. [Relieved] Ahhh.
Anais: That's not how you deal with a wasp sting.
[Gumball's lips swell up]
Gumball: I think I'm ready—
Nicole: To go back inside?
Gumball: No, to live in a forest.
Forage
[Scene changes to a big field and the camera is zoomed out far away from the Wattersons as they walk along a dirt path]
Gumball: Come on, to the forest of freedom, where we can pick ripe fruits off the laden trees and loot fresh fish from the teeming rivers, paying for nothing and living for freedom!
Richard: Ok. [Panting] But where is it?
Gumball: Wait, were you following me because— agh, let's just forage around the neighborhood, it's as good as it sounds.
Meal
[Scene changes to a cardboard with a few insects and worms and a dead frog on it]
Gumball: Ugh, is this what you eat every day?
Idaho: No, what I eat is healthier, it's the thing all food comes from and goes back too.
Darwin: Discount supermarkets?
Idaho: Nope, soil. [Grabs some soil and gives it to Gumball]
Gumball: Ok... [Eats the soil and pretends it's tasty]
[Scene changes to the x-ray of the organs in Gumball's body]
Tongue: Bah, this is disgusting, hey brain dude, can I spit?
Brain: Sorry tough guy, just man up and swallow it.
Stomach: What, me and my boys are not digesting that.
Small Intestine: Who are you calling boy stomach man, I'm five times the length of this body.
Large Intestine: Pfft, forget it intestine, pfft I'm tired off you, pfft always pfft blowing pfft hot air.
Heart: Come on guys, can't we learn to love each other?
[All the organs starts arguing and the camera zooms out of Gumball's body]
Idaho: You are not supposed to eat the soil, you just rub it on youself to get the good things from.
[Gumball spits the soil at Idaho]
Gumball: Oh thank goodness, I felt like my stomach was gonna punch my brain.
The Lifestyle
[Scene changes to night time where the Wattersons are laying on the grass and enjoying the night sky]
Anais: Ahh, how often do we get to sit back and gaze at the stars?
Darwin: And it's actually pretty comfortable out here.
Richard: [While twisting and turning] Speak for yourself, sleeping on the ground is more painful, like your back being shredded by a million dirty claws.
Darwin: I think you are sleeping on Gumball.
[Richard rolls away, revealing Gumball underneath him while the rest of the Wattersons laugh]
Nicole: This new lifestyle might be a pain, but at least we finally get some time together as a family.
[The Wattersons and Idaho hug each other]
Nicole: Thanks for showing us the way, Idaho.
All: Ahhhhh.
[After some time, a strange light coming from the house wakes Idaho up while the rest of the Wattersons are sleeping in the backyard]
Idaho: Aaugh.
[Idaho walks inside the house and loud music can be heard then Idaho gasps as he sees Gumball laughing maniacally and filling his mouth with whipped cream then eating some french fries then opens a soda bottle and pours soda all over himself while playing video games and listening to loud music, Idaho walks in the living room and Gumball stops laughing]
Idaho: Arrr—
Gumball: Shhhhh, I know what this looks like but before you tell me how wrong it is, don't you wanna try it?
[Gumball gives a slice of pizza to Idaho which he eats. Camera rapidly shows a series of pictures of Gumball and Idaho partying]
[The next morning, Gumball wakes up, his face wrinkled and dirty]
Gumball: Ughh, let's do it again.
[Gumball taps on Idaho who appears white]
Gumball: [While drinking soda] Dude, wake up.
[Gumball flips Idaho over with his foot and sees him pale and passed out from all that partying]
Saving Idaho
[The Wattersons are in their car, while Richard drives and Gumball holds Idaho in his arms. Darwin and Anais are glaring at Gumball]
Nicole: [Angrily] What did you do to him?!
Gumball: Nothing, we just ate junk food and played video games.
Anais: That's it, his pure country body couldn't handle the all filthy suburban lifestyle, it sent him into toxic shock!
Darwin: Wait, what were you doing playing video games, leaving us outside all night, you...you...you...
Gumball: Hypocrite? I know, I'm sorry, I hated this whole lifestyle from the moment I turned off the TV.
Darwin: Then why did you force us to keep it up?
Gumball: Because I got principles, just turns out I can't live by them.
[Richard reaches the hospital and causes Gary to fall then Richard stops the car out of the scene]
Anais: Wait a minute, he's a vegetable, he doesn't need a doctor, he needs a gardener, take him back to his home!
[Richard reverses, causing Gary to fall again]
Idaho: [Weakly] I— I— I—
Gumball: [Hugs Idaho] Shhhh, I love you too, my friend.
Idaho: I— I live about an hour away.
Darwin: Awkward.

[Everybody looks down and suddenly Idaho comes out, completely refreshed]
Idaho: Whooooooooo!
Gumball, Darwin, Anais, Nicole, and Richard: Idaho!
[Idaho hugs Gumball and goes back to his family]
Gumball: But how?
Idaho: [Slaps his leg] There's nothing a good old-fashioned dirt bath can't fix; I still don't know how you all can survive the life y'all city folks live.
