Lick That Elbow
[The episode starts with Gumball and Darwin walking through the Elmore Junior High corridor. Darwin has a chipped tooth and a black eye, while Gumball is trying to lick his elbow]
Darwin: [Lisping] I'm telling you, it's impossible. I tried and this is what happened.
Gumball: That can't possibly explain how you can chip a tooth while trying to lick your elbow. [Smashes into an opened locker door, giving him a black eye and a chipped tooth just like Darwin's] Ah.
[The scene switches to the nurse's office as Mr. Corneille walks in. Joan sees Mr. Corneille has a black eye and a chipped tooth]
Joan: [Gasps] Mr. Corneille, your face! What happened?
Moonchild Corneille: Pretty momma, handsome daddy. [Clicks tongue and points his thumbs towards his face]
Joan: No, I meant your black eye.
Moonchild Corneille: Hah, you should see the other guys. [Points backwards as Gumball and Darwin enters the nurse's office]
Gumball and Darwin: Hi, Mr. Corneille.
Moonchild Corneille: [Nervously laughs] I cannot stress strongly enough, these are not the other guys.
Gumball: What happened to your face?
Moonchild Corneille: Oh, I just walked into the cage and got hurt.
Gumball: What? You got into the cage, like, you’re an MMMMA fighter?
[Mr. Corneille tries to explain further but Joan cuts him off by reacting romantically. He goes with it and nods at her]
Darwin: What is that?
Gumball: Meaty Men Misunderstanding Martial Arts.
Darwin: Sounds kinda violent.
Gumball: [Blows raspberry] Only according to the so-called “medical community.”
Joan: [Romantic voice] Oh, Mr. Corneille, who knew you’d be so- [Squeezes Mr. Corneille's arm, returns to normal voice] oh, that arm feels a lot more withered than I thought it was gonna be.
Moonchild Corneille: Well when you're fighting in the cage, the most important muscle is the heart. And right now, you’re giving mine a workout.
[As Joan and Mr. Corneille giggle and blush, Gumball, with tears and snot on his face, rises up behind them]
Gumball: [Whispers] Teach us.
Moonchild Corneille: Uh, I-I don’t know, I-
[Gumball's head abruptly grows big, knocking down Joan, Darwin, and Mr. Corneille]
Gumball: TEACH US!!
MMMMA Training
[Transition to the gym]
Moonchild Corneille: The men who step into the cage love what they do. And by stepping into it, you're saying to your opponent, "I love you. But I'm gonna punch you in the body with my body with so much love that you pass out."
Gumball: What? I thought you were gonna teach us how to become tough fighter guys.
Moonchild Corneille: But if you rearrange the letters of "tough fighter guy," you get "tighter of hug guy." Coincidence? Yes, but a useful one. Come, let's get started.
[Gumball and Darwin try to perform mildly violent moves but instead keep performing friendly ones. While Darwin is rubbing Gumball's chin, causing him to purr, Principal Brown shows up]
Nigel Brown: I'm uh, sorry to interrupt whatever that is but I'm afraid I have some bad news. There have been some budget cuts and the school board has agreed to rent out half the school to another..."institution." So, I'm afraid you have to leave.
Gumball: Surely, there is a better solution.
Nigel Brown: This is our last resort. We've already cut everything we can from the budget. Look, [points backwards] those aren't even real fire extinguishers. They're just canisters of dippy string. If a fire starts in this school, things are gonna get very dippy... Also pretty tragic.
Darwin: So, you're just gonna privatize the school like some kind of prison?
Nigel Brown: Funny you should say that- [An alarm goes off] Oh-ho-ho, don't worry. Just means one of your new "classmates" has escaped. We'll know if everything really bad happens because the big siren will go- [Another alarm goes off. Gumball and Darwin begin to feel uneasy. Principal Brown is seen leaving the gym]
MMMMA Challenger Fight
[Gumball and Darwin are shown walking through town]
Gumball: What's happened to our school is a disaster. The forced exercise, the communal showers, the canteen slop, the unpaid work, the abuse of power. And if that wasn't enough, now with the prisoners it's gonna be overcrowded too!
Darwin: There must be a solution.
[A flyer hits Gumball in the face. He throws it aside, but it hits his face again. In frustration, Gumball crumples the flyer into a ball and kicks it upwards. The flyer unravels and hits Gumball once again. When Gumball is about to tear it to pieces, Darwin stops him]
Darwin: Wait, maybe that poster's fate hitting us right in the face with the answer to our problem.
[Gumball looks at the flyer, which depicts a woman, in tears, running away from another woman]
Gumball: Hair Force Gone. Full body waxing. Tell us when to stop, we won't listen.
Darwin: No, I meant that one. [Points at the billboard]
Gumball: [Gasps] An MMMMA Challenger Fight!
[Cut to school corridor near the nurse's office, Gumball and Darwin both stare at Mr. Corneille excitedly]
Moonchild Corneille: [Casually laughs] I'm sorry, but I don't fight for money. Violence is never the best solution.
Gumball: What about the nurse? She wouldn't even have a job if people didn't get hurt.
Joan: [Steps into the hallway] My alibi is watertight. Unlike that boat the previous nurse was in. [Short pause] I mean... [Takes Mr. Corneille's hands, making him blush] Mr. Corneille, surely you'll fight if it means saving the school.
Moonchild Corneille: But to go back into the cage, I'm gonna need a whole support team. Even a medic.
[Gumball pops up behind Mr. Corneille]
Gumball: I'll patch you up.
Moonchild Corneille: [Kicks Gumball away] I meant someone qualified, someone who knows how to use a scalpel and no, that doesn't mean you either, Frank the Butcher.
[Frank is shown standing nearby, sighs, and then walks away]
Moonchild Corneille: So what do you say, Ms. Markham?
Joan: [Removes her cap, making her hair unravel] Please Mr. Corneille, let's lose the formalities. My name is Joan.
Moonchild Corneille: Mine is Moonchild.
Joan: I'll stick with Corneille.
Moonchild Corneille: Fair enough.
[Gumball pops up behind Mr. Corneille again]
Gumball: So, you'll fight then?
Moonchild Corneille: Absolutely.
Mr. Corneille Joins the Fight
[The scene crossfades to a press conference]
Melted Cheese Guy: Time for the weigh-in.
[Mr. Corneille steps onto a scale. His weight is barely ten pounds. After that, a rumbling sound is heard. Mr. Corneille looks at his opponent with an intimidated look. The opponent's fist-like feet step onto the scale, which breaks under his girth. The camera pans back to reveal this opponent's head and hands are fists as well. The opponent growls at Mr. Corneille. A flash transitions to Melted Cheese Guy introducing the two fighters]
Melted Cheese Guy: On my right, we have the reigning champion, Joao "The Grave" Diga!
[Joao is shown to Melted Cheese Guy's right, with Gumball and Darwin sitting opposite Melted Cheese Guy. Joao slams down into his seat, making the crowd stop cheering]
Melted Cheese Guy: And on my left, we have the challenger... [Whispers to Gumball] What's his name, kid?
Gumball: [Whispers to Darwin] Quick! We need a name.
Darwin: Oh, oh, I got it, The Frog Prince.
Gumball: Sounds like he's gonna get kissed, by a fist.
Darwin: The Croaker.
Gumball: That's like he all he does, is croak.
Darwin: The Frogspawn.
Gumball: Nah, that's just gross.
Darwin: Colonel Jazzhand, The Germinate Crawler.
Gumball: Pfft.
Darwin: The Birthday Boy. [Gumball shakes his head] The Summertime Man. Wait, I've got it! Look out, it's Christmas Person.
Gumball: Are you having a brain cramp?
Darwin: Why don't you do better then?
Gumball: [Whispers to Melted Cheese Guy] The Amphi-Barbarian.
Melted Cheese Guy: The Amphi-Barbarian!
Darwin: Nah, that's better.
[A small amount of people in the audience are heard clapping as Mr. Corneille shows up and sits down casually]
Someone at the Audience: Where's the rest of him? [Cut to Mike in the audience]
Mike: He looks like one of those before-and-after ads but before the gym and after a disease.
[Audience laughs]
Gumball: You don't have to take that.
Joao: This man is a joke! [Slams table and stands up] You want a joke!? When I finish with you, [Shows his fist, pointing a finger at him revealing another hand, also pointing at him] they'll have to send your teeth to you in the mail. [Moves back his fist and sits down] Because the teeth will have landed far away and the postal service is the most practical way for you to retrieve them and avoid the necessity of going there on foot.
Gumball: Oh! Oh! Trash talking time! [Clears throat] Oh yeah? Well I heard you train twenty-four seven, which I guess you have the freedom to do when you have any meaningful relationships! Whaa?? [Joao slams the table in anger. Melted Cheese Guy ducks below the table] Heh. Being so rich and successful, it must be difficult to know whether your friends like you for your fame or for your lack of personality. [Joao growls loudly. Gumball then stands right in front of Joao's face] You know what's really loud, Joao? Insecurity. Confidence is silent, [Whispers] just like your empty mansion. [Joao growls in anger. Melted Cheese Guy separates him and Gumball]
Melted Cheese Guy: Gentlemen, please! Save it for the fight.
Joao: Before this, I was just gonna bake you. But now, I am going to end you!
[Audience cheers again]
Art of Training
[Gumball, Darwin, and Mr. Corneille are at at the park. Mr. Corneille is meditating]
Darwin: Mr. Corneille, aren't you little concerned what Joao said?
Gumball: Yeah, shouldn't you be like, training instead of meditating? Wait a minute. [Hears Mr. Corneille snoring] Ugh, [Moves Mr. Corneille's arm, waking him up] come on! How can you sleep when your opponent is capable of this? [Gumball grabs his phone and shows Mr. Corneille a video of Joao punching a battleship, causing it to immediately sink] That was a friendly match against the U.S. Navy. The week after that, he was scheduled to fight Belgium.
Darwin: Fight who in Belgium?
Gumball: The whole country. But they forfeited when they saw what he did to the ship.
Moonchild Corneille: Kids, you need to relax. I have a plan. Let that guy wear himself out with the grueling training schedule while I save my energy. I call it the art of training, without training. Cue montage.
[Cut to Mr. Corneille's office. Mr. Corneille is sitting with his feet on the table, reading, while Gumball and Darwin watch him "training" with excited looks. "Take a Rest, Sit Down" plays through the entire scene from Mr. Corneille's radio]
Voice: Take a rest, sit down
Let the other guy do the runnin' round
Take a rest, lie down
Ditch the track suit for a dressin' gown
[Gumball and Darwin stop with their excited faces and smile instead]
