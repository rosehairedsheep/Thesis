Missing Students
[Episode opens on the street as the school bus passes by. We then cut to the interior of the bus]
Alan​​​​​: Ah, it's great to have everyone back together again after summer vacation!
Leslie​​​​​​: But it kinda feels like something's missing.
Everyone: [All of the school kids put their hands on their chins, thinking] Hmm...
Banana Joe: MY PANTS! MY PANTS ARE MISSING! I'M NOT WEARING ANY PANTS! I NEVER WEAR pants, I don't wear any pants. Phew, that was close. Panic over. [Carrie tries to speak but is interrupted by Banana Joe] SHOES! MY SHOES ARE MISSING! Wait, I did it again! Why would I wanna wear shoes? I don't have any feet. [Has a shocked expression again and lifts his legs up] MY FEET! MY FEET ARE MISSING!
Masami: You're right though, there is something missing. It feels too...nice.
Tobias​​​​​​: Yeah, I've been wearing my new fresh hat for a whole twenty minutes and no one has made fun of it once!
Carrie: Let me rectify that for you. [Clears throat] I can see why you kept the label on, I'd want a refund too!
Tobias​​​​​​: Eh, first degree burn at best. Won't even leave a scar. Gumball would've come up with something WAY better.
Everyone: [Talk amongst themselves, then they all gasp] Where are Gumball and Darwin?!
Dream Or Not
[Cut to a shot of the Wattersons' house, then cut to a shot of Gumball and Darwin's room, which is empty]
Richard: Kids, KIDS! IT'S HALF PAST SEVEN! YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR YOUR FIRST DAY BACK! MOM LEFT ME IN CHARGE AND IF I DON'T GET YOU TO SCHOOL ON TIME, SHE'LL DESTROY ME– DESTROY YOU! Uh– US! [babbling] AH! [wakes up] Oh, it was a dream. It's not really seven-thirty.– IT'S EIGHT-THIRTY!!!
[Richard bursts through bedroom door]
Richard: AH! YOU'RE LATE! [removes bed sheets hurriedly] ARGHHH! [knocks on Darwin's bowl] Oh no, the kids have turned into school supplies! Or am I still dreaming? Only one way to find out. [jumps out window] Hmm, I can't fly, so this definitely isn't a dream. Not dreaming, start panicking. START PANICKING!
[Richard runs around the house, screaming, then calls Principal Brown]
Nigel Brown: Elmore Junior High.
Richard: Helloooo, this is my wife speaking.
Nigel Brown: Whose wife?
Richard: Uhhh, Richard's.
Nigel Brown: Mr. Watterson, what is it this time?
Richard: I'm just calling to say that the kids won't be here this morning. They've got uhhh, fat heads!
Nigel Brown: Doesn't sound that bad, send them in!
Richard: But that was just the start of it! They've also got a cough, their skin is falling off, and they've got black lumps all over their arms.
Nigel Brown: That sounds like the bubonic plague!
Richard: YES, THAT! I'm giving them vitamins, so they'll be in after lunch! Bye!
Nigel Brown: WAIT, WHAT? NO!
Richard: [hangs up, but the phone rings again] THE KIDS STILL HAVE THE PLAGUE!
Nicole: [extremely fatigued] Maybe it's because I just finished my night shift and I desperately need sleep, but I could've sworn you just said the kids have the plague.
Richard: No I didn't, you did!
Nicole: Did I? Oh, I'm so tired.
Richard: I know. Me too!
Nicole: Sure, an all night shift in the factory is nothing compared to half an hour of back to school shopping in the mall.
Richard: Exactly!
Nicole: Well, as long as you got them to school on time.
Richard: Come on, trust me!
Nicole: I know, I'm sorry for doubting you. [phone rings] Uh, listen, I'll pick them up after school. Love you!
Richard: [hangs up] Don't know what she's worried about, I'm a good father. [Richard's mirror reflection makes a gesture. Richard flips the mirror.] What do you know? [sighs] Where are they? Okay. The best way to find them is to retrace your steps. [runs around in reverse back into the bedroom] Okay they're not here. So, when did I last see them? It was yesterday afternoon... [flashback]
[Richard is out on the lawn]
Richard: Come on sleepy heads, Dad's shopping was so tiring, we're going to bed now even though it's only five o' clock.
[Richard takes out school supplies, mistaking them for the kids, and puts them in bed, kisses them, then passes out in his bedroom.]
Richard: Right, so if the shopping is in the beds, the kids must be... IN THE TRUNK! [barges out of the house screaming, and starts banging on the car trunk] Gumball! Darwin! Anais! Are you in there? They can't speak! They're running out of air! [tries blowing air into the car trunk until his ears suddenly pop] Ah! Open Sesame! Alakazam! Avocado Kredenza! What's the magic word again? Oh yeah. [slams into the trunk] PLEASE! [car keys fly out of his pocket] Aha! [tries sawing the car trunk with the keys] Wait! This is the key!! [tries to open the trunk, but fails] WHY ISN'T THIS WORKING!?
Gaylord: Because it's not your car, Watterson.
Richard: You're right! My car hasn't got all those dents in the trunk. Hmmm. [sits down] So I have my keys, but I don't have my car. How can that be?
[Richard has another flashback. It occurs at the mall's parking lot]
Richard: You guys stay here while I go get the ticket. [walks] Wait! A good father wouldn't leave his children in a hot car with the windows wide open [closes his car window and locks the car with the keys] Safety first.
[As Richard gets his ticket, Banana Barbara arrives and parks next to Richard's car. She gets out to take her ticket and Richard jumps in her car.]
Richard: All right kids. Let's go. [car keys won't fit] Uh? [slams cars keys into the ignition, somehow forcing the car to start] Prepare to jump into hyperspace! [silence] Aw! They sleep already. [drives off]
Banana Barbara: [running] Wait, my car!
Richard: [screams] The kids must still be locked in my car! [running] I'M COMING, KIDS!! [returns, extremely tired] My car!
[Richard gets in the car and drives away.]
The Original Car
[Richard drives to the mall.]
Richard: Come here kids. BREATHE! [punches and breaks glass of what is supposed to be his car's window, but turns out to be a parking booth] Where's my car?
John: Uhh, in Section D?
Richard: Thank you! [punches out Gary's car window] WHERE'S SECTION D?!
Gary: Just after section C.
[Richard punches out Gary's other car window]
Richard: Sorry! I forgot to say thanks!
[Richard is about to break his car window, but he notices the kids aren't in the car. He screams and breaks another car window, setting off a car alarm]
John: Please sir, stop break everything, what's going on!?
Richard: I can't find my kids!
John: Well when did you last see them?
Richard: Ummm.... Yesterday. After buying their stuff, I went to pick them up from the play center.
[Another flashback occurs. Distorted versions of Gumball, Darwin and Anais are playing in a ball pit. Richard arrives.]
Gumball: [different voice] Thanks, Dad. Did you get everything we need for school tomorrow?
Richard: Yes son, and now I'm here to take you home.
Anais: [different voice] That's wonderful! You're a great dad. [chanting, flashback fades away]
Richard: I'm a great dad. I'm a- Wait, NO! Come on brain! Tell me the truth. I CAN TAKE IT!! [He returns to his flashback, but the kids are even more distorted]
Anais: [still chanting] You're a great dad. You're-
[The kids and environment transform. The flashback is now in what is supposed to be Hell, and Gumball, Darwin and Anais are now flying demons]
Gumball, Darwin and Anais: [evil voices] GUILTY! GUILTY! GUILTY!
Richard: [screams] The demons of guilt!
Darwin: You abandoned your children in a public play center. What kind of father would do that?
Richard: A tired one doing his best?
Darwin: No! A lazy one doing his worst!
Gumball: You can't even remember precisely what we look and sound like.
[Richard screams as the flashback ends]
John: If I'm reading your subconscious correctly, you left your kids in a ball pit overnight.
Richard: Well it's better than leaving them in the trunk... I'm still a good father, right?
John: You know what's worse than leaving your kids in a ball pit overnight?
[Richard shakes his head]
John: Standing here talking about it!
[Gumball, Darwin, and Anais slowly drown in the ball pit]
Safety Preventions
Richard: What??
Larry: I said, the ball pit had to go. It wasn't safe. All those kids sinking, getting lost, the paper work! In the end we did the only responsible thing. Sold it to a country with less child safety laws.
Richard: You mean... I exported my kids?
Larry: Well, technically, he's exporting them.
[Larry points to a truck just outside the store. The truck leaves with the ball pit inside. Richard is about to shout something, but he gets cut off by the scene cutting to a view of the truck on the highway before we can hear him say anything]
The Richard/Hank Car Chase
Richard: Stop! My kids are in there! Stop! Hey! I said STOP! [punches out car window] Hey! Pull over! Pull over!
Hank: This is Big Neighbor. I got some creepo on my shoulder, all he wants to do is talk about my pullover. Thank goodness he can't see my shoes. I'm gonna shake him off, over.
[Hank drives faster, but Richard continues to pursue him.]
Richard: Hey! [opens door and reaches for the truck, but hesitates] Whoa! Wait up! [tunes radio to dramatic music] Perfect! I'm coming for you, kids! I'm coming! I'm coming! [the truck swerves away] In a minute!
[Richard thinks for a moment, then makes a U-turn to go after the truck]
Hank: Breaker breaker. This is Big Neighbor calling for backup. I got a– [flips through a manual] I got a ten-seventeen on my tail. Little help, please?
Richard: Hey! Pull o–
[Richard sees several trucks in his rear-view mirror]
Richard: Rush hour? I don't have time for this!
[The trucks surround Richard's car]
Hank: Thanks, good buddies. See you on the flip flop! Pedal to the metal.
[Hank drives faster]
Richard: [screams] My kids!
[Richard punches the front window, jumps onto the car hauler in front of him and gets in a car.]
Richard: Prepare to jump into hyperspace!
[Richard starts the car and the speed makes it soar through the air]
Richard: I am a good father!
[The car falls down]
Hyper-Crane
[Richard arrives at a container terminal and gasps at the tower of containers, then runs out of his car]
Richard: Kids! Are you in there?! [hitting container] Answer me!
[He runs to another section of the terminal and spots a crane. Somehow, he gets up and starts it with his car key]
Richard: Prepare to jump into hyper...crane!
[Richard uses the crane to grab a container, but it falls and releases plushies]
Richard: KIDS! Where are you?! [grabs a container; piano sounds are heard] Dunno what that is. [shakes another container] Dunno what that is. [grabs another container] Ah! The unmistakable sound of a thousand plastic balls knocking against each other inside a metal container! [laughs] I found you! I should probably stop shaking this thing now... [drops container] I'm coming!
[Richard goes out of the crane and rushes to the container]
Gumball: Dad, help!
Richard: Where's the door?! Kids, where's the door?
Gumball: On the other end!
Richard: Ah! [sees the container is locked with a digital lock] Aw! Okay! One-one-one-one-one. [pulls chain; still locked] One-one-one-one-two. [the container is still locked] Ah, we haven't got time for this! When mom asked me to get you to school, she didn't specify whether you had to be inside or outside of a shipping container.
[Richard hooks the container to his car]
Richard: Prepare to jump into hyper–
[As the container is too heavy, only the top part of the car is sent forward]
Richard: –space?
[Richard "parks" what is left of the car and drives a truck to the container instead]
Richard: Prepare to jump into hyper– Oh, I've wasted so much time saying that today. I should learn to talk and act at the same time, like your mother always says. [screams] Your mother! She's picking you up in three minutes! We're gonna need a shortcut.
Three Minutes to Spare
[Richard's truck is seen breaking through several buildings while Nicole drives to school. The truck drives through a big screen at the cinema and over the crowd]
Pantsbully: [in slow-motion] Awesome 3D!
[Richard arrives at Elmore Junior High and sees Nicole's car on the other side of the road. He drives in reverse into the schoolyard]
Richard: [Yelling] I am a good father!
[Just as the bell rings, Richard crashes the truck into the school. The container opens, releasing a flow of plastic balls as well as Gumball, Darwin and Anais, who are sent bouncing outside as Nicole parks in front of the school.]
Nicole: Hi, kids! How was your first day back?
[The kids stand there gaping for a while. Darwin spits out a plastic ball, and the episode ends.]
