First Sight of the Misunderstandings
[An unkempt Gumball is snacking on chips. The home phone starts ringing]
Gumball: [Groans and picks up the home phone] Yes?
Penny: Gumball, are you coming or what?
Gumball: But- but I thought you said we were gonna meet at dinner!
Penny: Yeah, we're having lunch at Dinner, the new diner that's just opened.
[Gumball lets out a loud, high-pitched shriek that shakes the phone on the other line]
Penny: Uh, hello?
Gumball: [Scrubbing his body with a sponge in the bath tub] Uh, yeah, yeah, sorry, I thought you said we were going to meet at the mall, not your house.
Penny: I am at the mall.
Gumball: [Muffled speech through the pants on his head]
Penny: What?
Gumball: [Unzips the pants] Me too! I- I can't see you though.
Penny: Really? Where are you?
[Gumball is frantically putting his pants while going down the stairs]
Gumball: Oh you know, right by that place- The one that sells uh, stuff-
[The phone cord untangles and his body splats against the wall, leaving his clothes by the door]
Penny: Gumball, you do realize I called you on your home phone.
Gumball: [Laughs nervously] Of course I- I mean. [Clears his throat] This is a voice message I left for you in case you called. Please leave your message after the beep. Beep!
[Penny pops out her eye from the phone]
Gumball: I'll be there in ten.
Penny: [Kisses Gumball on the cheek] Good.
[Gumball runs to the door and puts on his pants and sweater quickly]
Darwin: [Runs up to Gumball] Dude, look. I learned how to wiggle my ears. Check it out! [Stands still, squinting] Is it happening? Are they wiggling?
[Gumball walks out the door]
Darwin: Wha-- Wait a second! I jus- I just had it! You gotta see!
Gumball: Uh, yeah. [Describes something with his hands]
Darwin: What do you mean you wanna buy a new pair of fruit bikinis but you're not sure if the milk is off?
Gumball: What?
Darwin: That's what you just described with your hands.
Gumball: Ok. First, you don't have ears. And secondly, this is what people do when they wanna get out of a conversation without being mean.
Darwin: Well I think it's a little bit confusing.
Gumball: How is this remotely confusing? [Repeating his earlier gestures] "I'm late, I gotta go, I gotta hurry, I might call you but I definitely won't."
[Richard crashes at a street light]
Gumball: Dad?! What are you doing?!
Richard: It's your fault. [Repeating Gumball's gestures] You said go back, and keep going, and I'll call you when you get too close to the lamppost, which I thought was a bit weird.
Darwin: See, dude. Those signals are pretty easy to misinterpret.
Gumball: Fine, interpret this. [Describes something with his hands then runs away]
Richard: What? You bought a timeshare in a lighthouse with watermelon paper?
Gumball: [Growls off-screen]
Misunderstandings Through Journey to the Mall
[Gumball is running down the street]
Banana Joe: Hey man, wanna hang out?
Gumball: [Stops running] Hey Joe. I'm sorry, I really can't talk right now.
Banana Joe: [Singing] Should we just sing instead?
Gumball: Dude, I didn't have time for this. I really gotta go.
Banana Joe: Number one or number two? [Wiggles his eyebrows]
Gumball: What? Eww, no. Look, I don't wanna be rude but I need to leave. Follow me?
Banana Joe: Got it.
[Gumball walks slowly past Joe but realizes he is following him]
Gumball: What are you doing?!
Banana Joe: What? You said "follow me". I thought we were doing a walk and talk.
Gumball: Dude, I don't have time to talk! Am I clear?!
Banana Joe: [Zips his mouth and winks at Gumball]
[Gumball starts walking again, but Banana Joe walks after him]
Gumball: No! Just me walking. For you, there's no walking and no talking! Alright?!
Banana Joe: [Nods]
[Gumball starts walking, but Banana Joe is somehow following him without moving his legs]
Gumball: That was a- uh. Actually that was too impressive for me to be mad. But I'm gonna be as specific as I possibly can. You stay here and don't do anything. I will go to the mall, and see you later. Okay?
[Banana Joe inhales and salutes in agreement, Gumball starts running away, but Joe starts turning purple due to the lack of oxygen. Gumball running back to Banana Joe]
Gumball: You can breath though.
Banana Joe: [Exhales]
[Gumball keeps running, until the Hobo stops him]
Hobo: Excuse me.
Gumball: [Stops running] Uh, sorry I-
Hobo: I don't want any money, all I want is a moment of your time.
Gumball: Sorry, time is the one thing I don't have today.
Hobo: Got any money then?
Gumball: F-for what?
Hobo: To get my yacht waxed, of course.
Gumball: What?
Hobo: Heh-heh-heh, just kidding it's for new gold faucets in my mansion.
Gumball: Uhhhhhh...
Hobo: Still joking, it's for cosmetic surgery, [Puckers lips] I want fuller lips.
Gumball: U-uhhhhh...
Hobo: [Shouting] IT'S FOR FOOD OBVIOUSLY!
Gumball: A-ha, I'm sorry, I've got ten dollars, but I need to buy lunch for my friend.
Hobo: Oh, I see clearly we're not friends, huh?
Gumball: Well, no. Not really.
Hobo: [Whines] Look at you, my lord, with your big eyes and your pants.
Gumball: Wait, are you saying you're only wearing a trench coat right now?
Hobo: I don't know. Am I?! [Quickly opens his trench coat]
Gumball: [Screams then reacts normally] Oh I see, sarcasm. Look, don't be angry. We can still be friends.
Hobo: But not lunch friends.
Gumball: Look, I pro- I-I don't have the time right now, but I promise I'll buy you some food later at dinner. How's that?
Hobo: It's a date.
Gumball: Are you being sarcastic again?
Hobo: Can't you tell?
Gumball: [Sweating] Mhm...
Hobo: Hm? Hm?
Gumball: [Inhales] [Starts running] Oh, man, I'm super-late! [Looks at his arm, but there's no watch] I think.
Calling Out Cat-Calling
[Cut to the Construction Men making comments about passersby, as if harassing them]
Steve: [To Lollipop Woman] Hey.
Hank: Hey sweetie.
George: Hey. Hey, cupcake.
Hank: [To Martha] Hey.
Steve: Hey, cupcake. [Gumball runs by] Hey, kid.
Hank: Hey.
Gumball: [Stops running] WHAT?!
George: YOUR HEAD IS MASSIVE!
Gumball: [Hurt, he sizes his head, then looks at his palms, groaning] Aw. [Walks away sadly]
Hank: Good job, guys.
Construction Men: [Chortling]
Gumball: [Runs up to them] Hey, hey, you know what? NO. I'm in a serious hurry, but someone needs to take a stand here! So, in the name of all your victims...
[He blows a raspberry while making what appears to be a rude gesture with his fingers]
Construction Men: [Gasping]
Hank: I have no idea what that means, but it looks extremely insulting.
George: Is it a Vulcan gang sign?
Gumball: I don't know what it means either, but that'll teach you for making fun of my head.
Hank: What? But we meant it as a compliment.
George: A big head means a big brain. You must be very intelligent.
Gumball: Well, when you shout weird stuff [High-pitched voice] from a tiny head [Deep voice] between huge arms, [Normal voice] it scares people.
Steve: So what should we do to make people feel good?
Gumball: Try a softer approach. And keep your compliments simple, you're not doing too well with specifics.
Hank: Uh, okay. How about... [Whistles, then in a deep voice] Nice.
Gumball: [Shudders] That just went from uncomfortable to unacceptable. Uh, maybe just stick to a friendly gesture.
Steve: Oh, I got it! Hey. [Kissing noises]
Gumball: Stop, stop, stop! Maybe just a simple smile.
[The construction men all make creepy faces]
Gumball: You guys really need to get out more.
Hank: You're right! We need to hang out with some other people. But where?
George: The mall?
[The construction men chat in agreement]
Gumball: Definitely not the mall. That's where I'm going.
Steve: Schools?
Gumball: U-uh... [Sweating] Alright, the mall. Okay I gotta go now. I don't even know why I've been standing here for so long.
George: Because you're standing on concrete?
[Gumball is now stomping across the street with blocks of concrete on his feet. Richard pulls by in the car]
Gumball: Dad!
Richard: Need to remember! Your mom sent me to the store to buy one thing: "We're out of fruit. Just get the fruit and you won't get in trouble," she said. "Just remember Richard, buy the fruit."
Gumball: Perfect! Can you drive to the mall? It's on the way to the grocery store.
Richard: Sure can, watch me go! [He drives off]
Gumball: [Screams] Why does no one understand me today?!
[He kicks angrily at the traffic light, freeing his feet from the concrete. The pole falls right next to him - to his relief - but catapults the nearby trash bags directly onto his head]
Wrong Directions
[The scene changes to show a group of Shape People walking around. One of them is holding a map, they seem to be lost. Gumball runs straight into the map]
Ed: [High-pitched noise]
Gumball: [Reluctantly] Okay, where do you wanna get to?
Ed: [Drawn out noise]
Gumball: Alright, so take a right, then continue for a block, and it's on the left after the town hall. Got it?
Ed: [In shape language] Did you say left or right?
Gumball: [Mouth turns into a square as he speaks mechanically] Take a right, continue for a block.
Ed: [Nodding]
Gumball: [He keeps giving them directions but it sounds like an insult in their language] And it's on the left after the town hall. [Subtitled, "Your wife looks like a moose, and your ugly child smells like the carpet at a fondue restaurant."] Okay. I'm late for my date, so good luck. [Subtitled, "If you weren't such an anaemic chicken, you would defend their honor."] [Thumbs up, running away]
Ed: [Angry noises]
At the Mall
[Annoyed, Penny looks at a watch, waiting for Gumball to arrive]
[Gumball runs into the mall. He spots Penny and raises his hand as Jeff Benson runs an auction in the background]
Jeff: That's forty-five, for the little blue man in the back.
Gumball: What?
Jeff: It's all for a good cause. We're trying to end hunger today, not tomorrow just today, it's a small town you know? But let's get back to business. Do I have fifty-five? fifty-five? Need some fifty-five.
Penny: [Laughs]
Gumball: [Shrugs and raises his finger as if to say something]
Jeff: Fifty-five for the little blue man! And now I've got sixty-five.
Gumball: [Turns to Penny, raising his hand again] I'll be right-
Jeff: Seventy-five for the blue man! Now come on, we need a hundred. Need a hundred.
[Gumball shakes his head and shrugs at Jeff]
Jeff: A very slight move with the head, that's a hundred for the little blue man! Going once, going twice, SOLD!
Gumball: NOOOOO!!!!
Jeff: For a hundred cents, that's a dollar, well done everyone.
Gumball: Huh, a dollar.
[He walks in the diner to join Penny]
Penny: [Chuckling] What was that?
Gumball: I'm so sorry, it's just- Everyone is being completely useless today. It's impossible to communicate! It's-
Banana Joe: [Walks in as Gumball is about to sit] Hi!
Gumball: Ugh, just a second. What are you doing here?!
Banana Joe: You said: "I will go to the mall, and see you later." So here I am!
Gumball: [To Penny] Just order something, I'll be right there.
Banana Joe: Okay! Two pizzas and a milkshake, to share please.
Gumball: Not you, gosh darn it!
Penny: [Laughs]
[Suddenly, a wolf whistle is heard off-screen]
Gumball: [Shakes his head] Are you kidding me?
[Gumball leaves the diner to find the Construction Men]
Gumball: What do you want?
George: You told us to come to the mall.
Hank: Yeah, and we thought about what you said before. You were right, pretty creepy. But we've changed our ways.
Steve: How's this to brighten your day?
[The construction men surround an uncomfortable Gumball, leaning in as they speak]
Steve: Your face is perfect.
Hank: Your eyes are full of life.
George: Your fur is so soft.
Steve: Your tail is-
Gumball: Right! That sounds like the last thing the victim hears in a horror movie. Why don't you guys just find someone as weird as you to practice on? Someone who... Oh, wait a minute.
[Gumball pushes Banana Joe in front of the men, and forces them to look at him. He then runs off]
George: I like your skin. It fits you like a glove.
Banana Joe: Thank you.
Steve: You must work out.
Banana Joe: Okay! [He starts working out]
George: Wait, what?
Banana Joe: Wait for what what?
George: What?
Banana Joe: What what?
Hank: The what before the what?
Banana Joe: What?
Construction Men: [Nervous, their heads blast off one by one and their bodies drop to the floor] Ow!
[Gumball walks in the diner again, this time the Hobo is waiting for him]
Penny: Hurry up, my parents are picking me up in ten.
Gumball: Just- [Laughs nervously] Just start without me, I'll be right there.
Hobo: Who is that?
Gumball: What are you talking about?
Hobo: Here I am all done up for our date, and what do I see? You've been two-timing me!
Gumball: Are you being sarcastic again?
Hobo: [Angrily] Do I sound sarcastic?!
Gumball: [Crying] I don't know!
Jeff: [Taps Gumball on the shoulder] Hey, little blue man. You need to pay and get your prize for the auction.
Gumball: [Hands him a bill] Fine, what's the prize?
Jeff: [Takes the bill] A kiss!
Gumball: Okay, you know what, whatever. [He kisses Jeff on the mouth]
Jeff: [Shocked] On the cheek. From Miss Elmore. Comes with a dinner [Points to Miss Elmore, who is just Susan in a dress and sash]
Penny: [Laughs]
Gumball: [Glares at Penny, the fairy stops] You know what? I forfeit my prize. To him--her. It [Points to the Hobo]
Hobo: Come on, you! [He picks up Jeff and runs off with him]
Gumball: ...so! Where were we?
[They are interrupted again, this time by Ed from earlier. He strikes poses while threatening Gumball]
Ed: [In his language] You dishonored my family! You mocked my language, and questioned my courage, and you showed me your thumbs, which is culturally insensitive to my people, so now I will crush you!
Gumball: What?
[As Ed runs to Gumball, he is knocked over by Richard's car]
Richard: Sorry son, I don't have time to buy that fruit for you! Your mother said I had to drive the car to the mall.
Gumball: No dad, it was the other way around.
Richard: Oh, right. People are being so confusing today.
Gumball: I know, right?
[Richard tussles Gumball's head and drives off. Gumball shrugs; when he is about to walk back to the diner, Ed comes back and gets hit by the car again, he now holds on to the windshield]
Ed: [Angry noises]
Richard: The museum? [Laughs] Yeah, I can take you there!
Ed: [Happy noises]
[Witnessing the scene, Penny chuckles. She takes a bite out of her burger and starts choking]
Gumball: Hey! Sorry I'm so late.
[Penny makes gestures at Gumball as she continues choking]
Gumball: Oh, you've gotta go?
[Penny is still making gestures]
Gumball: Your parents have arrived? [Laughs] It's funny 'cause just this morning Darwin completely misunderstood that! [They both make the same gesture] Yeah, that! See, I love the fact that you and I just get each other. Anyway, you run now. [Kisses Penny and walks away whistling]
[Penny looks at Gumball in shock before making gestures to Karen, who slaps her on the back. She finally spits out the burger and glares in Gumball's direction. Episode ends]
