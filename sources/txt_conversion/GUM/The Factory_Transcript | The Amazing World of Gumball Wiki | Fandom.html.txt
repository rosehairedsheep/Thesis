Bring Your Child to Work Day
[At the Wattersons' house, Gumball and Darwin watch their father vegging out on the couch]
Richard: Then at ten o'clock, I do this. [Relaxed moaning] It's important to move every three hours or so. Otherwise, the rat gets too bold, thinks you croaked and starts biting.
[A rat shows up from its hole]
Richard: Not today, buddy.
[A rat backs off going back to its hole]
Richard: At around noon, it's lunch, so I go like this.
[He lazily eats a bowlful of cheese puffs resting on his chest]
Richard: Then, [Gulps] I like to look at things and think about what they'd taste like. [Stares at the rug] The rug would taste of peach Fruit Roll-up, and the TV would taste like burned crème caramel set in a rich, highland double-fudge base. [Salivates]
Gumball: Okay, I think since it's Bring Your Child to Work Day in our class, we might want to choose another parent. What do you say, Mom?
[An exhausted, shriveled-up Nicole appears from a mountain of paper work]
Nicole: [Gasps] No!
[Nicole enters the kitchen, takes a cup and a jar of coffee and puts a spoon of powder in the cup. She then takes out a water boiler but decides to directly pour all the water in the jar and ends up drinking it all in one gulp]
Darwin: But whyyyyy? We wanna see the Rainbow Factory!
Gumball: It'll be the best day ever! [Cheerfully] First, we'll watch the happy little elves whistling their merry tunes as they dig for color in the rainbow mines. [Starts whistling]
Darwin: [Cheerfully] Then, we'll see how the colors be mixed in the palette by dancing unicorns!
Gumball: Then, we'll hear the singing of the orange munchkins as they churn it with their magic machines! [Normally] And then, we pause for a couple of hours for lunch, [Cheerfully again] and then—
Nicole: [Hoarse voice] You only get an hour for lunch.
Darwin: Oh.
Nicole: That we have to share between fifty people. And I said, "No!"
[The scene changes when Nicole goes to the bathroom then stares at herself on a mirror]
Nicole: [Sighs] I look like I've been thrown into space without a spacesuit.
[Nicole takes a paintbrush and a paint can, but she throws away the brush and dips her face in blue paint and then re-draws her face using makeup]
Gumball and Darwin: Please take us!
Nicole: [Normal voice] No!
Gumball: We'll pay you ten dollars.
[Darwin hands Nicole a piece of paper]
Nicole: [Reading] "Can we have ten dollars?" [Groans] I said, "No!"
[In her bedroom, Nicole takes out a uniform from her wardrobe and sprays it and herself with air freshener]
Gumball: But whyyyyy?!
Nicole: Because the CEOs are coming down to decide whether to close down the factory and give everyone their pink slip.
Gumball and Darwin: [Gasp] A pink slip? Like a magic ticket?!
Nicole: Yeah, a magic ticket to unemployment and depression. So, you guys are gonna stay with your father and do... whatever it is he does.
[Nicole fixes her briefcase]
Gumball: Ah, please. Hanging out with Dad on his work day is like watching a ripe avocado turn into guacamole with just the force of gravity.
[Richard is shown melting on the couch, just like Gumball describes]
Nicole: [Sighs] I get your point, but I can't have you there today. [Gasps] I got to run! [Runs out of the house] If I'm much later, I'll be back for dinner before I get to work!
[Gumball hands Nicole her briefcase from the door]
Gumball: Wait! Your briefcase!
Nicole: Oh, boy! Thank you, sweetheart. [Exits]
At the Rainbow Factory
[Nicole enters the office of the Rainbow Factory]
Nicole: [Talking to two line graphs] Good morning, gentlemen. I'm so sorry I'm late. I worked all night on these figures, and I can assure you there's absolutely no need to close the factory.
Shareholder: [Clears throat] We are the shareholders.
Nicole: Oh, sorry, right. [To the graphs] And you are?
Shareholder: Objects, Watterson. They're inanimate objects.
Nicole: Right.
Shareholder: Now, please, give us the stats.
Nicole: Oh, yes, of course.
[As soon as she opens her briefcase, Nicole sees her sons and closes it immediately]
Nicole: [Inhales deeply] I'm sorry. I've left them on my desk. [Exits]
Shareholder: If you're not back in two minutes, we'll move your desk to a bathroom stall.
Nicole: I know you mean that as a threat, but as we're not allowed to take bathroom breaks, it would technically be an improvement.
[Nicole pours the two out of her briefcase]
Nicole: Give me those!
[Gumball picks up her documents]
Nicole: Are you kidding me? How on Earth could you be in there?! You handed me the briefcase yourself!
Gumball: Yes, but from the inside.
[A flashback reveals Gumball giving Nicole the suitcase from the inside of the briefcase]
Gumball: Wait! Your briefcase!
Nicole: Oh, boy! Thank you, sweetheart.
[Gumball slips his arm in the briefcase, ending the flashback]
Nicole: [Stammers, sighs] I'm going back to the meeting! Meanwhile, you're going to stay here and touch nothing! Have I made myself clear?
[Nicole stares at their feet touching the floor]
Nicole: I said, "Nothing."
[Gumball and Darwin float. Nicole's documents spill out of her briefcase as she leaves. He and Darwin step back down]
Gumball: [High voice] Oh, no. She dropped some important stuff, giving us the perfect excuse to look for her and check out the factory in the process.
Darwin: But she told us to stay here.
Gumball: Darwin, all it takes for bad things to happen is for good people to do nothing.
Darwin: I don't think we count as good people.
Gumball: Then, all it takes for good things to happen is for bad people to do something.
Darwin: Oh. Uhhh. Uh, no.
Gumball: What?
Darwin: I'm totally convinced.
[Gumball and Darwin smile at each other]
"Red, Orange, Yellow"
[Gumball and Darwin open a door of the factory and start singing and dancing around]
Gumball​: Let's find out how they put these magic colors in the sky!
Darwin: With unicorns and pixies, candy cane and apple pie!
Gumball: I used to think that they were caused by how the light refracts
Darwin: But now, I'm sure it's magical, so who we gonna ask?
Gumball and Darwin: Hey! Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet!
[Gumball and Darwin pick up two pipes and use them as dancing canes, they then approach one of the workers]
Darwin: Hello, friend, now tell me
Are you elf or are you gnome?
Blue Elephant: Neither, kid, the lack of daylight stunted every bone
Gumball: And is this color made from lemonade and fairy dust?
Blue Elephant: It's gasoline and arsenic and latex, lead, and rust
Gumball and Darwin: Hey! Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet!
[Gumball and Darwin dance away from him]
Darwin: I must admit, that guy back there did not fill me with magic.
Gumball: In fact, he made it sound as if his job was pretty tragic.
[Gumball and Darwin then arrive at a much more magical looking side of the factory]
Darwin: But look, there's elves on tricycles and fountains of molasses.
Gumball: Unless it's a hallucination caused by toxic gases.
[The hallucination snaps and Gumball drags away a still dazed Darwin]
Darwin: Led, lorry, lellow, greeny, bludigo, and violet!
Leonard Daniels: Well, I don't mind, it's not that bad
This job still has its perks
Like, for example... Uh... [Sighs]
Dark teal construction man: Careful, Len, mind what you say
You know the walls have ears
[A security camera stares at them]
Don't wanna end up stuck all night, like poor old Mr. Frears!
[Jeff is shown to be very exausted and ends faiing asleep on the pipes and getting rolled up]
Darwin: Where are all the roly-poly imps in dungarees?
Gumball: Instead, it's tears and bitterness and awful salaries.
Darwin: We thought it would be full of fun and colorful rainbows.
Gumball: Instead, it's gross and gray, and let's be honest, it just blows.
[Gumball and Darwin throw away the pipes and walk out of the door]
Don't Press the Button
[The shareholders murmur with each other in Nicole's meeting]
Shareholder: What about blinking time?
Nicole: Uh, what about it?
Shareholder: Well, every second spent blinking is one less second doing the job. I suggest we ban it.
Nicole: Ban blinking? That's impossible.
Shareholder: Then I suggest we reduce it by seventy-five percent.
Nicole: What? How?
Shareholder: Like this. [Blinking halfway]
Nicole: Uh...
Shareholder: Okay, just spitballing here, but how about, instead of the employees having to spend so much time going home to look after their own children, they just share one massive child to save on cost?
Nicole: Wh— what about the other children?
Shareholder: Feed them to the big one, group our assets, maximize value, Watterson!
Nicole: But sir, some of our employees are quite attached to their children.
Shareholder: I don't care! The only people I've got pictures of in my wallet are Washington and Benjamin— my two sons.
[The shareholder takes out a wallet with a photo of three pig children, with the youngest being erased with a marker]
Nicole: Ohh. [Laughs] That's so funny. I thought you were gonna heartlessly show me a couple of dollar bills. They're very cute, sir.
Shareholder: I was about to say there was a third one— Hamilton. He was fired for going over budget. Only two hugs a day. He knew the rules.
[Gumball and Darwin show up and display Nicole's papers in secret]
Shareholder: To be honest with you, this inspection is irrelevant, since we've already decided to move the factory to another country where workers aren't always whining about...
Nicole: [Quietly] Get back.
Shareholder: ...like basic human decency, access to direct sunlight, women's rights, men's rights, dental plans, or desks. [Inaudible]
Nicole: [Quietly] Go away.
[After a series of misunderstandings, Gumball and Darwin think they should press the button]
Shareholder: ...All of this is to say, we're shutting this place down.
Nicole: Wait, what? [Pointing down] You're shutting this place down?
[Gumball and Darwin mistake her gesture and press the button]
Nicole: No, no, no!
The Button Incident
[Pigments explode around the factory. The soulless office worker writes to say 1 accident-free day but gets knocked out by the gases. A splash of color corrodes the board, engraving a "0." The alarm buzzes]
Shareholders: What's going on here?!
Nicole: Just give me a couple of minutes and I'll... [Shouts] Okay! A couple of seconds!
[Gumball and Darwin enter the office]
Gumball: Um, Mom. I think you can stop the meeting. There's not much left of the factory you can save.
Shareholder: Children in the workplace! What is this, every other factory I own?
Nicole: [Sniffs] I'm sorry, sir, but there's no time to discuss this now. We need to evacuate the premises at once. This gas is extremely tox...
[Hallucinations appear]
Nicole: [Low voice] All in favor of adjourning this meeting, say "Aye."
All: Aye!
[All evacuate the meeting room]
Shareholder: I'm a wealthy man! This isn't how it's supposed to end! I'm supposed to croak alone in my mansion, surrounded by all the expensive things I wasted my life buying while my children fight over their inheritance!
Nicole: Look, the exit! Hurry up!
[The hallway turns distorted, with Nicole ending up squeezing her head through the shrunken door. In a dark void, a firefighter appears alongside a goat]
George: Come on! Get on the magic goat and play the banana!
Nicole: Wait, what?
[A traffic guard blocks their way, and as soon as they hit him, Nicole wakes up in the office]
Nicole: [Groans] What happened?
[A flashback reveals everyone passing out from the toxic gases]
Nicole: All in favor of adjourning this meeting, say "Aye."
All: Aye! [All grunt; flashback ends]
Nicole: [Moans] The fumes. Ugh. The override button! [Presses button; moans] Why isn't this working?
[The button turns out to be a hallucination of the shareholder's nose. The shareholder and Nicole scream, causing Nicole to repeatedly press his nose]
Shareholder: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! [Through speaker] Okay, I promise not to close the factory and no more budget cuts. All right, ten more days vacation, and a raise for everybody! Thank heavens everyone's out cold and didn't hear that.
All: [Suddenly awaken] Yeah, we did! Ugh. [Faints]
[The shareholder moans and passes out. Nicole notices the override button at the other side of the room]
Nicole: [Gasps] The override button. [Scoots over to Darwin] Darwin. Darwin, wake up.
[In his dream, Darwin cartoonishly dances around. His shoe rings, and Darwin picks it up]
Darwin: Hello?
Nicole: Wake up! Wake up!
[Darwin wakes up and groans]
Nicole: Go and press the button.
Darwin: [Weakly] Gumball, wake up. [Kicks Gumball in the face]
[In Gumball's dream, he and Penny are floating in space. Just as they're about to kiss, Darwin's foot comes out of Penny's mouth and kicks Gumball in the face. He wakes up, sounding out slurred mumbling]
Darwin: Push the button.
[Gumball, with grunts and groans, scoots to the wall and climbs it, using his bruised "suction cup" eyes and pressing the button with his tongue]
The Factory Is Saved
[The factory's destruction is overridden. Rainbows shoot out of the smokestacks. Inside, Gumball and Darwin are thrown up into the air by a crowd of celebrating workers]
All: We kept our jobs, although we're slobs
The factory's not ablaze
Ten more days vacation, and we even got a raise
We skirted unemployment and a future on the skids
Thanks to Mrs. Watterson and her two weirdo kids!
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, hey!
[Gumball and Darwin glance at each other, smile, and fist bump. The episode ends]
