Missing
[A tune on a music box is playing.]
Anais: It always looks like a normal day. Mommy's at work, Daddy's asleep on the sofa, the birds are singing, and the sun shines on Elmore.
[The camera is showing Anais' dolls, Darwin's shoes, and a cracked picture of Gumball and Darwin.]
Anais: It's in these completely normal moments that horror chooses to strike. The floor was covered in Daisy's stuffing, and she was missing.
[Anais is holding a cracked picture of her hugging Daisy.]
Anais: And I was starting to think she didn't walk out that door on her own two feet. Mainly because she is an inanimate object.
[She puts down the picture and starts to investigate the room.]
Anais: I could see from this stuffing pattern that there had been some sort of a struggle. [Takes a chalk and start to sketch Daisy's outline on the floor] This is where she hit the floor. It looked like a robbery, but why take the doll and leave the computer? A DNA search would tell more. [Turns the keyboard over; Dust pours onto the table] The evidence pointed towards a blue cat and an orange fish, but they could be victims, too. I needed more proof. There was no glass on the desk. The window was broken from the inside, and the prints suggest that someone with abnormally large hands was involved...or someone with an abnormally large finger.
[She dips her finger in the milk on the floor and tastes it by rubbing it on her gums.]
Anais: [Gasps, groans] There was enough sugar in that bowl to turn their brains to jelly.
[The scene transitions to a brief, trippy slow-motion flashback where dreamy classical music accompanies Gumball and Darwin laughing as they eat their cereal.]
Anais: Daisy got caught in the middle of their sugar binge, and something so bad happened they decided to make it look like a robbery. Still, without a body, there's no crime. I needed a witness. DAD!
Richard: Yeah?
Anais: Stop!
[Richard looks down to see yellow tape in front of the door. He steps back.]
Richard: What's that?
Anais: What does it look like? Police tape.
Richard: Why is it eight inches up the floor?
Anais: Because my arms are too short to– I'm the one asking questions here!
Richard: Are you playing good cop, bad cop?
Anais: No, this isn't a trashy eighties cop show. This is quality subscription television mysteriously mumbly southern detective. [In a southern accent, barely intelligible] Y'all hear anything weird coming from this here room this mornin'?
Richard: ...Huh?
Anais: [Sighs] Did you hear anything weird coming from this room this morning?
Richard: No, but there was a strange noise coming from the bathroom. Sounded like... [Blows a raspberry]
Anais: Kind of like a slice of ham caught in a desk fan?
Richard: No, no, wetter.
Anais: You mean like a cafeteria lady being slapped in the back with a fish?
Richard: Little less wet, little more fluffy.
Anais: A watermelon hitting a sofa bed? ...in June? In Kentucky?
Richard: More like fabric being ripped by tiny fingers. The next thing I knew, the boys ran out of the house in a panic.
Anais: Thank you, sir. That'll be all.
Richard: [In a frantic southern accent] What are you gonna do? Don't hurt m'boys! Them's m'boys, y'hear? M'boys!
Anais: The man wasn't lying. His boys did something terrible. He stood there, sweating; another small town yokel who wasn't enough of a man to prevent his sons–
Richard: Hey!
Anais: Whoops! [Laughs nervously] Did I say that out loud? Sorry, it was meant to be internal monologue.
Richard: Well, you better be nice with your lomonogues, young lady!
Anais: Sorry, Dad. Another decent man whose sons went off the rails and were beyond his control.
Richard: That's more like it.
In the Bathroom
Anais: [Following the trail in the corridor] Two boys high on sugar, and a sweet doll caught in the middle. I was scared – scared to discover what happened to her. Could I even open the door to that bathroom?
[Anais jumps to open the door but barely reaches the handle. She decides to kick the door open instead.]
Anais: [Picks up stuffing] She was dragged here.
[Anais imagines Gumball and Darwin dragging Daisy into the bathroom hurriedly.]
Gumball: No, no, she's not responding! We're too late!
Darwin: It's never too late!
[Darwin performs CPR on Daisy, but it only forces more stuffing out of her.]
Darwin: Okay, now it's too late.
[Anais' investigation resumes.]
Anais: Seems like there was a lot of movement. They went from here, [Points to a spot on the floor] to here, [Points to another spot] to there. [Points to another spot, then writes something down] Were they fighting? Mm, more like Irish dancing.
[She imagines Gumball and Darwin dancing around Daisy.]
Anais: No, they were panicking. There are droplets on the floor. What are they? Saliva? That would suggest an argument. [Imagining her brothers arguing] Whenever he's losing an argument, Gumball always resorts to a raspberry. Or are they tears? Maybe Darwin lost the argument, but what were they arguing about? ...Scissors? [Gasps] Oh no!
[Anais begins to imagine Darwin about to cut Daisy's head off above the toilet bowl.]
Gumball: Do it, it's the only way to get rid of the evidence!
Darwin: I can't!
Gumball: But she won't flush in one piece!
Darwin: She might, but you'll have to eat it first.
[Back to reality, Anais leans over the toilet.]
Anais: No, they wouldn't be that stupid. [Imagines Gumball chewing on Daisy] Eh. The garbage bag is gone, and toiletries, and their toothbrushes!
[In another flashback, Gumball pulls Daisy out of his mouth.]
Gumball: It's not gonna work. We need another way to get rid of her!
[Darwin picks up the garbage bag and throws their toothbrushes in.]
Gumball: What are you doing?!
Darwin: I say we run.
Gumball: We've already gone too far!
Darwin: No, we haven't. We're still here.
Gumball: It was a metaphor. If we run, we're goners, Darwin!
Darwin: But who's to say the police will take us down?
Gumball: Sorry, that one wasn't a metaphor. I literally can't run, I'd croak thirty meters from the house. We need to deal with this here and now! [Darwin takes a few steps back] Darwin...
Darwin: I'm sorry! [Runs away]
Gumball: No, no, no, wait!
[Back to reality, Anais stands in the doorway to the bathroom.]
Anais: The only way to find Daisy is to find Gumball, but this is where the trail goes cold. And the best–
Richard: [Doing the potty dance] Are you done yet?
Anais: Yeah, sorry.
The Search Continues
[Anais is now outside.]
Anais: I continued my search, but all I found was myself going in circles.
Richard: Put your helmet on, sweetie!
[Anais sighs and puts her helmet on, then keeps driving her trike in circles. Moments later, she chugs milk from a baby bottle and puts it down on the counter.]
Anais: Daisy. Her chances were dripping away, minute by minute, like milk from a bottle. Keep it comin', Rich.
[Richard slides her another bottle, which she quickly drinks up.]
Anais: But there are no refills in life. I couldn't sleep without her. I was barely napping at all. Daisy. Daisy. Daisy. [She wakes up on the couch] There must be something I missed. [She examines the broken window in her brothers' room] And that's when I saw him.
[She sees Richard playing a video game on the front yard.]
Anais: Not him. Him!
[She looks at Darwin instead, who is putting something in the trash can. When he notices he is being watched, he runs away. Anais follows him into the backyard.]
Confronting the Accomplice
[Anais walks up to the front door of the shed.]
Anais: All I had to do was follow Gumball's accomplice. [Knocks on the door to the shed] Open up!
Darwin: I know my rights! You need a warrant!
Anais: I got an outstanding warrant with your name on it. [Writes down on a post-it and shows it to Darwin. It reads, "Outstanding Arrest Warrant for Darwin Watterson."]
Darwin: Hm, that is well written for a four year old, but I wouldn't call it outstanding.
Anais: [Kicks the door open] Where is she?!
Darwin: Who?!
Anais: If you tell me where Daisy is, I'll negotiate your time in the naughty corner down to four minutes. With good behavior, you might be out in two.
Darwin: I didn't do nothin'!
Anais: One way or another, you're gonna talk.
[Anais holds a knife-like object, as if to threaten Darwin, causing him to panic and scream. She unfolds it to reveal it is just a handheld fan.]
Darwin: Thank goodness, I thought you were gonna hurt me with that!
Anais: No, that's what these are for. [Points to the tools on the wall]
Darwin: [Collapses to the ground] Okay, okay, okay! I'll talk! I'll talk.
Darwin: [In a raspy voice] It was a day like any other–
Anais: Hey! I'm the only one who gets to do grisly flashbacks.
Darwin: Well, how else am I supposed to tell you what happened?
Anais: Okay, fine. But do it in your own voice.
[Darwin's flashback starts, first showing the house, then the boys' room.]
Darwin: [Narrating] It was a day like any other. Although, we both had a lot of cereal.
[Gumball pours the last bit of cereal and throws the box aside.]
Gumball: [Blows a raspberry] No more!
Darwin: [Chuckles] You said [Blows a raspberry]
[They laugh hysterically, then Gumball grabs Daisy.]
Gumball: This is how you laugh. [Imitates a laugh]
Darwin: And this is how you laugh. [Takes Daisy and imitates another laugh]
[They take turns using Daisy to mimic each other's laughs and end up fighting for it. When the doll tears, their amusement quickly turns into panic. The flashback ends.]
Darwin: We were just kids having fun, it was an accident! I told him we should confess, but he wouldn't let me! Then we went to the bathroom, and–
Anais: I know what he tried to make you do to her. I know. But where is he now? If it's just a split seam, maybe we can still save her?
Darwin: Save her? Uh, uh– Th-th-the cellar! That's where he took her.
Anais: Just one more thing. Why did you need the trash bag?
Darwin: Wha?
Anais: Oh, of course. For Daisy.
Played
[Anais walks down the stairs into the cellar]
Anais: Somehow, it always ends up at the bottom of a cellar. This is where we abandon our darkest mistakes: between the treadmill and the fat-free grilling machine. But I wasn't gonna let the darkness take her. Not Daisy...
[Gumball is digging out the basement floor with a shovel.]
Anais: Freeze! [Holds her hand like a gun]
[Gumball holds his hand behind his back as if hiding a gun. He then holds it up and looks at it hesitantly.]
Anais: Don't! Throw it away.
[Gumball throws his "gun" away.]
Anais: I said throw it away!
[He pretends to unload the gun and throws it away, again.]
Anais: Get on the ground.
Gumball: [He falls to his knees and lies down with his hands behind his head] I didn't do nothin', it wasn't my fault!
Anais: Then why are you digging a hole?
Gumball: I was gonna go underground!
Anais: That's not what that means!
Gumball: [Tears up] I realize that now. Please, don't make a "pew pew" sound with your mouth!
Anais: Pew pew! ["Shoots" at a nearby pipe] Where is she?!
Gumball: I don't know!
Anais: Where's the trash bag?
Gumball: There, there!
[She opens the bag and gasps, but only finds a toothbrush.]
Anais: What? [Imagining Gumball packing his toothbrush] It was Gumball who ran away. It was Gumball who lost the argument. [Camera zooms onto a picture of Darwin] Like a crow disguised as a dove, he played me. Played me like an old banjo. It was Darwin's plan to destroy the evidence.
[Gumball holds Daisy above the toilet, preparing to cut her head off.]
Gumball: [Crying] Why can't you do this?!
Darwin: Because I don't have opposable thumbs!
Anais: [Remembers seeing Darwin at the trash cans] He'd already gotten rid of her when I found him in the shed!
Saving Daisy
[Anais runs up the stairs and finds Darwin sobbing in front of the empty trash cans.]
Darwin: [Crying] I never wanted it to go this way.
Anais: What have you done?!
Darwin: I was too late, I didn't know we could save her. I didn't know, I swear! [Imitating Anais' voice as she ponders] Sure, I was mad, but I forgave Darwin for throwing Daisy in the trash to cover my–
Anais: No, I don't!
Darwin: Sorry, it was worth a shot.
[The garbage truck starts driving away.]
Anais: The truck! [Rides her trike] I can still save her! [Goes after the truck] As I sped down the road at breakneck speed, my mind also started racing. How could I have missed so much? Daisy was another victim of a ruthless world who didn't know how to care for her fragile beauty. She was within arm's reach that whole time, and yet, now she's slipping through my fingers once again! On her way to be discarded, flushed away, drowning in a torrent of sorrow, plastic bags, and cardboard boxes. Well, not on my watch!
[Just as she is about to reach the truck, the driver is done throwing his garbage bag into his truck and drives away. He stops at another house, leaving some time for Anais to catch up, but he drives further down the road yet again. This goes on for some time.]
Anais: I gave it my all, and it still wasn't enough. I had failed her; that's when they arrived.
[The Wattersons' car speeds towards the truck and crashes into it, sending the contents of the bags flying, including Daisy. Anais gasps.]
Anais: Redemption is a funny thing. Those responsible for her suffering are the very ones who saved her.
[Richard, Gumball and Darwin search the trash pile and find Daisy.]
Anais: She was banged up, but okay. Nothing a few stitches couldn't fix. [Richard is seen repairing Daisy] The boys did a bit of time, but at least they got things cleaned up. [Gumball and Darwin do the dishes under Nicole's watch] As for me, [Anais is in bed, holding Daisy] I found sleep again. I guess the story wasn't as dark as I made it out to be.
Richard: [Turns on the light] Night, honey!
Anais: Night!
[Richard turns off the light and the episode ends.]
