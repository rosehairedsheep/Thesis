You Snooze, You Lose
[The episode starts off with Nicole exiting a tent]
Nicole: [Takes deep breath] Oh, it's so nice to finally do something together as a family.
[Camera zooms out, revealing the Wattersons are tenting on the sidewalk. Gumball, Anais, and Richard stare angrily at Nicole]
Nicole: Wait a minute, we pitched our tent at the front of the line, why are we all the way back here?
[Camera pans to show a long line heading to the cinema]
Anais: Someone must have moved us back in the night to get themselves a better position.
Pantsbully: [Laughs] You snooze, you lose guys. Literally.
Anais: Why did you put us back in the line at all? Now we're stuck next to you all day.
Pantsbully: Well, I lost my place in the line when I was moving your tent so... It's awkward now, isn't?
Anais: Kinda.
Pantsbully: Sorry, I'll go.
[Pantsbully walks away as Colin and Felix rush up to the Wattersons]
Colin: Is this the line for the first screening of Stellar Odyssey?
Felix: Please, Colin, use the full title. Stellar Odyssey, Colon, The Force Rehashed.
Richard: Sorry, boys. We camped out all night and we're at the back of the line.
Felix: [Sighs] Since when did sci-fi become so popular with normal people?
Colin: What next? Mainstream culture making films and hit TV shows that has superheroes and dragons and—Oh wait.
[Colin and Felix sigh and walk out]
Wattersons at Second Screening
Richard: Hah, can you imagine the embarrassment, not getting into the first screening? [Hears Larry closing the line with a rope] What's that for?
Larry: Uh, this rope means you won't get into the first screening.
Richard: Hmm, I think we [Waves hand in a manner similar to a Jedi mind trick] will get into the first screening.
Larry: Uh, no. You won't.
Richard: Yes, [Waves hand again] we will.
Larry: No, no you won't. [Walks away]
Richard: [Sighs] His powers are too strong.
Nicole: Oh, why do you all care so much about a movie where a guy hangs out with a whistling trashcan, hates his robot dad, and kisses his sister. There's a second screening in half an hour anyway.
Gumball: Mom, the second anything is pointless. No one remembers the second guy to invent the telephone.
Nicole: That's because he didn't invent it.
Gumball: Alright, then, no one remembers the second guy to walk on the moon.
Nicole: Buzz Aldrin.
Gumball: Now you're just making up names.
Anais: If we see it before anybody else, think all the power we'll have at school. The power to spoil or not to spoil. [Her face begins resembling Darth Sidious, as well as her voice lowering in pitch] Soon, they'll be begging to find out which of their dumb fan theories was correct. [Laughs menacingly]
[Camera zooms out, Anais freezes her movement while Darwin, Nicole and Richard look at her in a confused way]
Gumball: Aaaand that's why you don't have any friends.
Anais: [Face goes back to normal] Aww.
Richard: Those films were so important to me, the first one changed my life forever.
Nicole: Aww, honey. Because it was our first date?
Richard: [Stares at Nicole for a few seconds] Yeah sure, I... remember it like it was yesterday?
Nicole: Why don't you flashback to it now, then?
Richard: Alright. [Thinks]
[Richard "flashbacks" cut-outs of himself and Nicole dancing. In the present, Richard moves his hands in a similar manner to the flashback]
Richard: Was I close?
Darwin: I just hope Chuckie's in it. He's so good at providing the whimsical comic relief, that no one asked for. [Imitating Chuckie] Oopsa, Whoopsa, We's-a outta oxygens.
[The Wattersons suddenly hear someone using a gas mask. Marvin, with an oxygen tank and a gas mask, walks past them]
Marvin: [Removes mask] Gosh darn, paramedic! I go into respiratory arrest for one minute, and he steals my place in the line [Uses mask]
Spoilers
Gumball: Well, it's a dog eat dog world.
Quattro: Who eats what? Was that a spoiler? A dog eats a dog?
Siciliana: Way to spoil the whole plot!
Someone in the Line: Called it!
Quattro: [Walks out of line with Siciliana] Come along, Siciliana, let's go see a movie where a dog eats normal things.
Gumball: [Thinks] Hmm... that gives me an idea.
[Short pause]
Anais: You gonna share it with us or what?
Gumball: Oh, yeah.
[Scene pans to Julius and Rotten Cupcake, also in line]
Rotten Cupcake: Ah dude, I can't wait to see this movie!
Julius: I know, it's so exciting, anything could happen.
Rotten Cupcake: Yeah, anything. [Talks fast] As long they keep it intact with the same way it was in the first three movies and nothing changes at all.
Julius: I want surprises but, you know, only the ones I expect.
Rotten Cupcake: [Phone vibrates, he checks it and gasps] The first review is online!
[Rotten Cupcake and Julius watch the video, which shows Gumball disguised as a movie critic, "reviewing" the film]
Gumball: What up, Elmore Streamers, it's Dollyboy nineteen twenty-three, aka PixelDonkey. I just got back from seeing Stellar Odyssey, Colon, The Force Rehashed. No spoilers, but it's so refreshing to see less CGI space battles and more sock puppets. And what a brave decision it was to recast all the main characters as female, including the robots.
Julius: Ughh, I can't believe it! They ruined the whole [Throws phone onto the ground] franchise! [Angrily walks away]
Rotten Cupcake: Dude, that was my phone! You could've just stopped the video. [Walks away]
Larry: ...five fifty-nine, five-sixty. Congratulations, Wattersons, you're in.
Gumball: Oh, this is great! We're getting into the first screening.
Anais: Where are we sitting?
Larry: Well, here's the seating plan. [Holds up a pamphlet of the seating plan and points to the screen on it] This is the screen and you are... [Unravels the rest of the plan. It keeps unfolding until it stops in front of Gumball. Larry points to the last row on it] there.
Nicole: What are those in front of our seats?
Larry: Columns. They're not holding anything up, but this way we can charge more for seats that don't have columns in front of them.
Nicole: Uh, what row are we in?
Larry: Well, we ran out of letters for the rows so we had to start making up our own alphabet. You'll be sitting in row [Looking at the sitting plan] cleft.
Nerd-Off
Richard: I hate cleft! That was my grade average at school. [Groans] I may as well be at home watching the holiday special.
Teapot: [Gasps] How know you of this? [Removes his hood] Only a true fan would watch that special.
Richard: I think you'll find I'm the number one fan.
Teapot: Uh, I'll have you know that I'm the president of the Stellar Odyssey Fan Club, [Aside] Elmore Chapter.
Richard: Really? I thought you'd be into like, tea and stuff?
Teapot: What- That's it! There is but one way to settle this. A nerd-off.
Anais: Can we take your place in the line if our dad wins?
Teapot: More than that! If I lose, the whole of the Stellar Odyssey Fan Club [Aside] Elmore Chapter, will go to the back of the line in disgrace.
[Members start complaining about the Teapot raising the stakes]
Member of Fan Club: I wanted to see the movie.
Teapot: Silence!
[Colin and Felix both approach Richard and the Teapot]
Colin: A nerd-off?
Felix: We, too challenge you in this mighty test of nerd-dom.
[The people in line merely laugh at Colin and Felix]
Richard: Please, you weren't even born when the original trilogy came out.
Teapot: You have no idea how hard for us fans before the internet.
Richard: That's right, you got chatting rooms, webalogs, sociable medias.
Teapot: Yeah, and now even the most facially-challenged nerd can find love online instead of spending their life alone like I do.
[Citizens in line once again laugh at Colin and Felix, who walk away]
Colin: Come, Felix. Society may laugh at us but we're used to it. We're nerds.
Melted Cheese Guy: Okay, whoever's done the saddest, most nerdiest thing is the victor. Biggest loser wins, and commence!
[The scene transitions to Teapot and Richard battling on bridge. Every time they say something, they make a hand gesture, levitate something and throw it at their opponent]
Teapot: I can't count to ten, but I'm fluent in Android binary!
Richard: I'm not actually pink, I dyed my whole body to match the coolest colored laser sword!
Teapot: I built a full-scale replica of the Billennium Buzzard out of my own hair!
Richard: I wore a gold bikini under my suit on my wedding day!
Teapot: I changed my middle name to Bardadecca!
[Teapot hits Richard, making him fall, but he catches a ledge. Teapot laughs]
Richard: I only adopted Darwin so that I can say I have two sons!
Teapot: Nice try, but I forced my only school friend to call me Imperial Highness for thirty years! [Prepares to kick Richard off the ledge]
Richard: No! Wait! Friend? You had a friend!?
Teapot: No, no, no, wait! We're not even that close!
[The scene turns back to normal, Richard is seen laying on the ground]
Melted Cheese Guy: We have a winning loser!
Teapot: [Falls in defeat] No-o-o-o!
Masami: [Sarcastic] Oh, good job!
Alison: [Sarcastic] Nice one, Martin.
[The rest of the fan club gets out of the line, as a Construction Man drags Teapot away]
Gumball: Awesome, [The Wattersons run closer to the front of the line] we're gonna get front row seats!
Banana Bob​: I don't think so. I have called the front row! I've been camping here since before they announced they were making a movie. I missed my wife and kid's birthdays, a jury summons, an emergency [Tooth falls out of his mouth] dental appointment... nothing is going to stop me from seeing this movie! Nothing! You think I'm not serious? Would a guy who isn't serious do this? [Chews on his own arm] Is that serious enough for you!?
[Banana Bob opens his peel, pulls off part of his body and begins eating it as the Wattersons watch in disgust. Banana Bob, off-screen, eats more of himself until he is reduced to a pile of banana goo on the ground. Everyone stares in silence]
Gumball: Well... we're at the front of the line. [The Wattersons all cheer. Gumball's phone then vibrates, and he checks it] Uhh, guys, what street is this?
Nicole: Elmore Boulevard, why?
Gumball: Well, I just got a reminder saying that our tickets are for the cinema on Elmore Street.
Nicole: That's the other side of town!
Colin: What? The screening is on the other side of town?
Felix: We've only got ten minutes to get there!
[Colin, Felix, and the other citizens in line run off-screen]
Gumball, Darwin, Anais, Nicole, and Richard: What?
Darwin: What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get there in time?
Nicole: We make the jump to light speed!
Mad Dash to Elmore Street
[Cut to Nicole trying to start the Wattersons' car, but the engine stalls]
Nicole: Ah, [Slams fist onto steering wheel] piece of junk!
Richard: Hey! This piece of junk did the school run in twelve minutes.
Nicole: It only takes the bus five minutes.
Richard: I stopped at the drive-through to get their breakfast.
Anais: I know, let's use the mall speeders!
[Pantsbully is shown riding a scooter as he drives past Tobias and Crocodile Woman. Nicole then runs up alongside, pushing a shopping cart with Anais standing in it. Pantsbully and Nicole's cart bash into each other a few times before Anais and Pantsbully start pushing each other. Anais overpowers Pantsbully, sending him into a reversing semi truck as Richard passes by with Gumball and Darwin]
Nicole: Quick, let's cut through here!
[Nicole and Anais go through the automatic door, while Richard, Gumball, and Darwin break through the glass on the other door. The Wattersons continue navigating the store in a manner similar to podracing]
Anais: Look, the exit!
Felicity: [Robotic voice] I have you now. [To Billy, through gritted teeth] I'll take these myself. Cover me!
[Billy starts throwing canned foods at the Wattersons while making laser sounds. A can hits Richard's cart, making him squeal in a similar way to R2-D2]
Gumball: I've got a bad feeling about this. Dad, do something!
Mystic voice: Use the sauce, Richard. Use the sauce.
Richard: I've got it! [Grabs a bottle of hot sauce and throws it at the exit's door button. The sauce bottle just breaks]
Darwin: No, use the forks. Look!
[Darwin gives Richard a fork. Richard throws it at the exit's door button, but this time the fork hits the button. As the door begins to close, the Wattersons skid on their sides, barely sliding under the door in time. Felicity and Billy crash into the door, leaving their imprint on the other side. Meanwhile, the other citizens are still rushing to the other cinema]
Anton: I'm gonna need a shortcut! [He enters an alley, but is noticed by a flock of pigeons. Anton moves slowly along the wall] Maybe I'll cut through here, instead. [Anton opens a door that leads him into a bar full of birds] Uh, excuse me? What's the quickest way to Elmore Street place?
[Music stops playing, all the birds stare at Anton. Meanwhile, Bobert blasts Leslie and Melted Cheese Guy with his lasers, but then Tobias and Jackie smash his head with trash cans]
Tobias​: Mom, did you get the VIP seats?
Jackie​​​​​​​​: Course not, it's a reboot. Chances are we'll be out of the theater in ten minutes.
Tobias​​​​​​​​: [Pretends to force-choke Jackie, causing her to fall] I find your lack of faith disturbing.
[As Tobias keeps running down the street, Hector follows behind him, passing by Carmen and Masami]
Carmen: Somebody needs to stop Hector! He's gonna get there before us in two more steps!
Masami: [Grabs a garden hose] Leave it to me.
[Masami uses the hose to tie Hector's legs together, making him collapse onto a building, blocking the Wattersons' path]
Sacrifice
Gumball: Oh no, we've only got a few minutes to get there, and now we're gonna be at the back of the line again!
Nicole: [To Richard] Honey, we're slowing them down, or, more accurately, you're slowing them down.
Richard: Huh?
Nicole: Remember when Ben Kenoli sacrificed himself at the end of the first movie?
Richard: [Gasps] You do care about them!
Nicole: You've made me watch them every year since we got married. You even put them on when I was giving birth to Anais.
Richard: [Crying] But they're good movies!
Nicole: I know. But it's their franchise now.
[Richard looks at the kids, nods to Nicole, and walks away with her]
Anais: What are they doing?
Nicole: [Holding Richard's hand, crying] Excuse me, is this the line for Stellar Odyssey?
Richard: Yes!
Gary: Look! Over there! There's a line!
[Several citizens rush in line behind Nicole and Richard]
Gumball: They're forming a decoy line... [Covers Anais' eyes] Don't look.
[Richard and Nicole both look at each other and smile]
Richard: I love you!
Nicole: I know.
[Darwin lets out a growl like that of Chewbacca's]
Gumball: Come on, we gotta go. [Leaves with Anais and Darwin. Nicole and Richard continue to stand in place]
Richard: Can we at least go to the second screening?
Nicole: Yeah.
[Gumball, Darwin, and Anais rush through the neighborhood to get to the cinema, until they see a sign for Elmore Street]
Gumball: Yes, we're here! Elmore Street! [He, Anais, and Darwin turn a corner, but abruptly stop running. Gumball gasps] What the?
Darwin: [Gasps] It's a trap!
Anais: No, it's more of a con. [Camera angle changes to reveal an empty lot in front of the kids] There isn't a theater on Elmore Street.
Darwin: Yeah, and if mom booked the tickets, why did Gumball get the reminder?
Gumball: And who sent it?
[An optical wipe transition reveals Colin and Felix sitting in an empty theater, both laughing]
Felix: Hacking the theater's database was easier than bulls-eyeing a swamp rat from a T-fifteen.
Colin: To the real nerds everywhere, space is for the geeks! [Collides his cup with Felix's] Surely nothing can ruin this for us now, Felix.
Chuckie: [Movie] Oopsie-whoopsa! [Colin and Felix appear to be disappointed by his appearance] It's me, Chuckie! [The sound of laser guns is heard, and the Eggheads are satisfied] Meesa being blasted in the face!
[Colin and Felix fistbump as the episode ends]
