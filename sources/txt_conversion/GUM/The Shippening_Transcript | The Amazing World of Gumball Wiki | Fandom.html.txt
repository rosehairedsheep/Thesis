Investigating the Awesome Store
[The episode begins with the police arriving the mall´s parking lot. They stop next to The Awesome Store]
Van shopkeeper: Ah, officers, what can I do you for?
Donut Sheriff: License, please.
Van shopkeeper: Sure, there you go. [Hands a license to Doughnut Sheriff]
Donut Sheriff: That's a doctor's license.
Van shopkeeper: Yes. That'll be a hundred dollars. [Sticks out his hand to receive said payment]
Donut Sheriff: Alright, keep your hands on the wheel. Guys, check what he's got back there.
[A blue Coffee Cop and Frank check the back of the van. The blue Coffee Cop takes out an umbrella. When he opens it, it begins raining on him. Lightning suddenly strikes him, causing him to disintegrate. Frank then pulls out an old doll]
Frank (Cop): [Disgusted] Guh. This is some creepy doll, chief. [Pulls a string on the back of the doll]
Creepy Doll: We are friends
Everything is fine
[Eyes open, demonic voice] What's mine is yours
And what's yours is mine.
[The doll possess Frank, causing him to drop the doll]
Donut Sheriff: [Offscreen] What was that, Frank?
Frank (Cop): [Possessed, with a childlike voice] Nothing, Chief. [Skips off laughing. Meanwhile, the Soda Cop is holding a magic lamp]
Soda Cop: [Yawns] I really wish I was in bed today.
[The magic lamp rattles, and a cloud of green smoke surrounds Soda Cop. When the smoke clears, he is seen trapped inside a bed, which falls over. The Hamburger Cop then looks inside the van. Inside are piles and piles of other strange items.]
Hamburger Cop: Uh... we're gonna need some reinforcement, sir!
Donut Sheriff: Oh come on, trooper! How big can one truck be?
Van shopkeeper: [Reaches out and points with his thumb] There's a map on the fifth floor.
[From inside the van, a quack can be heard, followed by growling and a horse grunting. Hamburger Cop looks inside, but then moves out of the way. From inside the van, a creature with a duck's head and wings and a horse's body runs off. Hamburger Cop then notices a pair of glasses that have fallen on the ground, and tries them on]
Hamburger Cop: [Gasps] Wow, everything looks so beautiful. The light, the world, the... huh? [Grabs his sides] Where did these love handles come from? [His phone then rings. He grabs his phone and yells as he sees a photo of a moose on his phone] My wife! She looks like a moose! [Takes off glasses] What kind of dark magic is this?
Van shopkeeper: Uhh, they're not magic. I think you just need glasses.
Donut Sheriff: Alright, most of that stuff looks pretty illegal.
Van shopkeeper: I think you'll find all the right paperwork in here. [Sticks his arm out of the van again, this time holding a briefcase. The Doughnut Sheriff takes it and opens it. Inside are stacks of money]
Donut Sheriff: There's no paperwork here, it's just thousands of dollars! [Throws briefcase] We're taking you downtown.
Van shopkeeper: Fair enough. See you guys there!
[The Van Shopkeeper starts the van and drives away]
Frank: Sir, he's getting away!
Donut Sheriff: Or maybe he's making a u-turn so he can take the correct exit.
[The van drives through the brick wall of the parking garage. After it falls to the ground, it veers through the parking lot, crashes through the guard rail, and drives onto the highway]
Donut Sheriff: Maybe he's made a mistake and will realize that isn't the way to the precinct.
[The van then drives through the signal on a toll booth]
Guard 2: Hey!
[Doughnut Sheriff sighs]
Sarah and the Notebook
[Cut to Sarah's house. Sarah is seen walking outside, wearing cat sunglasses and a shirt reading "otaku" in Japanese. She shields herself from the sun as she walks to her mailbox. When she opens it, she finds a Japanese magazine inside. Suddenly, the Van Shopkeeper drives the van through a fence and heads for Sarah's yard. Sarah screams and jumps out of the way. As the van drives into the distance, it drops a notebook. Sarah begins inspecting the notebook, but then hears police sirens. She screams and dodges again as a swarm of police cars drive by. Sarah gets up once they are gone]
Female Coffee Cop: Boss, that ice cream girl just stole a piece of evidence!
Donut Sheriff: Good point, sergeant! We should go get ice cream.
Female Coffee Cop: Don't you mean you should go back and retrieve that notebook?
Donut Sheriff: Sorry, you're right. We should definitely go for ice cream!
Female Coffee Cop: Okay, and then we check on her.
Donut Sheriff: That's right, yeah. Then chicken.
[Meanwhile, Sarah inspects the notebook further. The Cartoon Network logo is engraved in gold on the front. Sarah squeals and takes the notebook inside whilst giggling. Inside, she sits down at her desk]
Sarah: Who should I ship today? [Gets an idea, laughs, and starts writing and narrating. As she narrates, everything she says is shown happening in real time]
The Shippening Cometh
Sarah: The sun was rising over Elmore... [The day suddenly shifts to night and early morning. As it does so, Leslie's face closes up, and he runs into the bus stop sign] And there was something intoxicating in the air. [At the mall, several citizens start choking] It was love! [Karen and Byrdie suddenly appear in dresses, while Cowboy and Steve are seen with open vests and large muscles. The scene then transitions to Teri browsing through perfumes while Alan and Carmen walk by] Which brings us to a lonely young girl called Teri. She lived her life in the safety zone, but there's no medication for falling head over heels... [Teri literally does so] in love. Alan rushed over... [Alan suddenly flies out of Carmen's grasp, making a high-pitched squeal as he flies towards Teri. Teri leans up and gasps]
Sarah as Alan​​​​​​: Did it hurt?
Sarah: Alan said, the gentle light glistening on his chiseled features.
[Alan's body literally chisels away as he screams. After his body chisels away, he is seen the same as before, but now making a handsome face]
Sarah as Teri: Not as much as all these years yearning for you!
Sarah: She said, her heart in her mouth. [Teri's heart briefly sticks out of her mouth, but she swallows it back down] Without further ado, they kissed, their lips crashing into each other, [Alan and Teri jerk forward, with Alan ripping right through Teri's head] forever oblivious to the world around them.
[Gumball and Darwin walk by, then notice Carmen staring at Alan and Teri]
Carmen: I have no words.
Gumball: Then please, allow me. [Clears throat, walks over to Alan] I'm dumping you, you iron-jawed gas sack! [Walks away, Alan collapses. Carmen appears distraught] You're welcome. [Walks away with Darwin, until they both stop]
Darwin: Uh. And what're you gonna say about that?
[Clare and Hot Dog Guy are both seen holding hands]
Clare: In that moment, I felt something I've never felt before!
Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​: I love the way you speak your mind. Literally.
Sarah: Without further ado they kissed, the waves of their love sweeping away everything around them.
[A large ocean wave sweeps through the mall, carrying Clare and Hot Dog Guy away. Gumball and Darwin, dumbfounded, watch the spectacle]
Gumball: I would say it looks like Cupid needs to lay off the ambrosia for a while.
Strange Ships Are Happening
[Larry and Karen are seen at Joyful Burger. Gumball and Darwin walk by in the background]
Larry: Look, Karen, I've been meaning to ask you for a long time, [gets down on one knee and pulls out a ring] and I finally got the money for a ring.
Karen: Oh, Laurence, I thought you'd never a-
[Larry suddenly slides away from Karen, passes Gumball and Darwin, and slides down the escalator. He stops in front of Mr. Small at the bottom of the escalator, turning to face him. Mr. Small rips off his clothes, revealing a wedding gown underneath them]
Mister Small: I will!
Gumball: Serving some bridal realness there, Mr. Small! [Shrugs to Darwin]
Gaylord: [Offscreen] Honey, I love it.
[Cut to the tattoo store, where Mr. Robinson is with Banana Barbara]
Gaylord: This'll truly represent our newfound love. [Holds up the planned tattoo; a burger with arms folding its hands into a heart shape] And it'll look great on my shoulder.
Banana Barbara: No. I want it here. [Pokes Mr. Robinson's nose. The two then embrace in a kiss]
Gumball and Darwin: What the what?
Rocky: [Offscreen] Hey! [Screen pans to Rocky] How's it going, guys?
Gumball: [Gasps] We can't let him see his dad kissing Barbara!
Darwin: We need a diversion!
[Idaho walks by. Gumball, offscreen, throws him at Rocky]
Rocky: Ow! [The top of his head gets knocked backwards, and he starts walking backwards as well, groaning all the while. Darwin glares angrily at Gumball]
Gumball: Well it's still less painful for him.
[Rocky, still walking backwards, falls off the mall's top floor. He is then heard hitting the ground]
Rocky: [Offscreen] Ow!
Gumball: Well, his feelings are still intact. I'm sure he'll thank us one day.
Darwin: After six months of physiotherapy and learning how to talk again!
[A loud rumbling is heard. Gumball and Darwin look up and see Hector and Masami through the mall's roof window]
Masami: I've waited forever for this kiss!
[Masami and Hector try to kiss, but Hector ends up sucking Masami into his mouth. Hector tries to cough her up, but is unsuccessful and passes out. Gumball and Darwin are seen in the elevator]
Darwin: Is it me, or is something really weird going on today? [Pushes button, elevator door closes]
More Ships, Oddballs, and the Culprit
[Tobias is seen talking to someone offscreen outside the mall]
Tobias​​​​​​: I guess I've always known we've shared deep feelings but sometimes, it's hard to see what's right in front of your eyes. [Cut back to reveal Tobias is talking to his own reflection] I love you, man. [Starts kissing the window. Gumball and Darwin look on in shock. Darwin gestures towards Tobias]
Gumball: I dunno, man. That doesn't seem so out of the ordinary for him.
[Gumball and Darwin walk out of the mall. As they do, the automatic door slides open and then closes. Tobias remains kissing the door, and its motion drags his face with it. Gumball and Darwin then encounter two very odd-looking characters. One resembles Gumball but has a tuft of hair and green wings, the other a pink Darwin lookalike with blue shoes and a propeller hat]
Zachariah: [Shouting] Hi!
Gumball: Who are you?
Zachariah: I'm your cousin, Zachariah Lopez Kirby! I have a hyper mood and I like paragliding and ducks! I hate arguments and itchy hats! [Crosses his arms. Gumball and Darwin are visibly befuddled]
Gumball: Uhh... right.
Bexi: And I'm Zachariah's girlfriend, Bexi! It's short for Albexandra. Backstory: I was raised by my uncle Timutet and his twin dogs, Rahmir and Castro. Catchphrase: [Shouts] This bird is out of control!
[Gumball and Darwin stare at the two oddballs for a few seconds]
Gumball: [Whispers] Okay. [He and Darwin quickly walk away]
Darwin: How often would she get to use that catchphrase?
Gumball: Dude, I think you were right. I don't see how this day could get any weir-aaaaaand [Points offscreen] here we go.
[The shot then changes to a strangely-drawn adult Gumball and Carrie on a bench, holding a baby]
Darwin: [Yells] WHAT THE? DUDE! THIS IS SO MESSED UP!
Gumball: I know, right? I mean, a future me? Wearing sandals?
Darwin: I MEAN YOU'RE GONNA STEAL CARRIE FROM ME! IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE "CARWIN," NOT "CARBALL," YOU HOMEWRECKING WOMAN-EATER!
Gumball: [Shocked, points into the distance] And it looks like I didn't stop at women.
[Further away from the adult Gumball and Carrie, there is a wedding taking place between a female, anime-style, human Gumball, and a human, anime-style Darwin]
Darwin: Aaaaah!! [Sobs]
Gumball: I agree. Always thought I was the one wearing the pants in this relationship.
Darwin: What is going on?!
Gumball: [Growls] This mess has got Sarah's name written all over it!
Darwin: How do you know?
[Gumball walks over to the adult Gumball and Carrie, and points to adult Gumball's foot. Below it is a copyright symbol followed by Sarah's name. As Gumball points this out, dramatic music plays]
The Shippening Goes Too Far
[Sarah is in her room, continually writing love stories in the notebook]
Sarah: [Evil voice] Her heart pounding in her chest, Penny said to Banana Joe, "Let's never split."
[Gumball and Darwin break through Sarah's door, making her scream]
Gumball: [Scary voice] What did you do this time?
Sarah: Nothing, I swear! I was just writing some non-canon AT and AR ships. The odd oneshot here and there, and a bit of OOC, some OC drawings of course, but mostly OTP stories and fanservice!
Gumball and Darwin: Wait, what?
Sarah: [Holds notebook] Well, I was just writing love stories about everyone in Elmore! I got a bit carried away. [Awkwardly smiles]
Gumball: Where did you get this? [Takes notebook from Sarah]
Sarah: Well, it fell off the back of a truck! That's not a euphemism, it literally did.
Gumball and Darwin: [Gasp and look at each other] The Awesome Store.
Gumball: Well, just take a look at what happened when you wrote in it.
Sarah: Wait, wait, wait. [Puts on cat sunglasses] I'm an otaku, the light could kill me.
[Gumball opens Sarah's curtains. Outside, Melted Cheese Guy and Karen, Mrs. Jötunheim and Hank, Richard and Felicity, Byrdie and Hobo, Idaho and Ocho, Hexagon Lady and Marvin, Penny and Banana Joe, and Leonard Daniels and Doctor Literature are all seen together. Nicole and Yuki then ride by on a unicorn]
Darwin: It's like a commercial for male deodorant out there.
Sarah: Oh, my gosh. So when I wrote all this, it became canon in reality. Excuse me for a second. [Turns around and giddily laughs]
Darwin: Well you gotta fix it, okay?!
Sarah: Right.
[Sarah takes the notebook from Gumball and tears a page out. As she does, the anime groom Darwin crumples up like paper. The female anime bride Gumball screams in terror]
Sarah: Oh, I probably need to destroy it thoroughly.
[Sarah, Gumball and Darwin turn away from the window. The anime groom Darwin then un-crumples, tears in half, and then is shredded to pieces. Anime bride Gumball continues screaming]
Anime Bride Gumball: Are you oka-
[She is cut off by anime groom Darwin spontaneously combusting, making both of them scream. The fire then douses itself with water. Cut back to Sarah's room, it is revealed these effects were caused due to her tearing up the page, setting it on fire, and dousing it with water]
Anime Groom Darwin: [Offscreen] Uh, hey? I'm alive and in quite a lot of pain.
Sarah: Okay, so, the only solution is to rewrite it back to normal.
[Police sirens are heard, as is knocking on Sarah's front door]
Donut Sheriff: Open up! This is the police!
Sarah: They're here for the notebook!
Darwin: Then hurry up and start already!
Sarah: Okay. [Opens the notebook and thinks]
Donut Sheriff: [Off-screen] Open up!
Sarah: I got nothing.
Gumball: What?!
Sarah: I got writer's block! [Hands the notebook to Gumball] You're gonna have to do it!
Gumball: Uhh... [Starts writing in the notebook]
The Shippening Doth Come to a Swift End
[Cut to the mall. Gumball, like Sarah earlier, is heard narrating]
Gumball: Mr. Small looked at Larry and said-
Gumball as Mister Small​​​​​​: It's not you, Larry. It's me.
[Larry transforms into Mr. Small's likeness. Gumball can then be heard writing]
Gumball: Oh, wait, no.
[Larry returns to normal]
Gumball: Larry said-
Gumball as Larry: We can't see each other anymore.
[Mr. Small and Larry both give terrified looks at the camera and then grow skin over their eyes. They both scream]
Gumball: It was a hard blow for Mr. Small, [Mr. Small falls over as if he was punched] and Larry was destroyed. [Larry's head explodes, the smoke cloud is visible from Sarah's house]
Darwin: You're making it worse!
Gumball: Th-th-this is hard!
Darwin: Just keep it simple! Like...Principal Brown and Jackie Wilson broke up!
[Principal Brown and Jackie are seen rollerskating in the park, but as Darwin says this line, they literally break apart like glass]
Darwin: Scratch that. They get back together.
[As Gumball writes this, Principal Brown and Jackie reform, but as one, horrifying mutant. This causes Frog Kid to faint. Meanwhile, Doughnut Sheriff is seen trying to break down Sarah's front door]
Sarah: They're breaking down the door!
Gumball: I got this!
Donut Sheriff: [Breaks down Sarah's front door] Come on, troopers! Go, go, go! [The other cops enter the house. Suddenly, Doughnut Sheriff's dialogue gets slower, and Female Coffee Cop stares at him. He is then seen with muscles and speaks in slow motion] Bring on the heat.
[Female Coffee Cop stares at Doughnut Sheriff, with an anime-style face, and sighs]
Darwin: Good job, dude!
Gumball: I haven't written anything yet. But I'll send a little something to delay them.
Donut Sheriff: Come on!
Female Coffee Cop: [Quickly] Come on, come on, come on!
[Sarah's stairs then change to an escalator, making the police fall to the ground. Gumball continues writing in the notebook]
Gumball: Bobert, Jamie, and Tina were having a picnic. [The three characters are seen in the park doing just that] They knew it would be their last meal together.
Gumball as Tina: Don't be so sad, what we had was beautiful. Let's eat Bobert.
Gumball: Tina said.
Darwin: Wait, shouldn't there be a comma before "Bobert?" [Points to the space between "eat" and "Bobert"]
Gumball: [Scoffs] What difference does that make?
[Tina and Jamie are seen eating Bobert's parts, with Bobert's head sprawled on the ground. Gumball resumes writing]
Gumball: Penny said to Joe...
[Penny and Banana Joe are both sitting in swings]
Gumball as Penny: It's over.
Gumball: And his stomach twisted into a knot as he cried. [Banana Joe's body twists, and he promptly sheds a tear. Hot Dog Guy and Clare are seen outside the mall] Hot Dog Guy and Clare looked at each other with tears in their eyes.
Gumball as Clare: We need space.
Gumball: Said Clare.
Gumball as Hot Dog Guy​​​​​​: I agree.
Gumball: He replied.
[Hot Dog Guy and Clare blast off into space like rockets, both of them gasping for air]
Gumball as Adult Gumball: I'm sorry, but this is moving too fast for me.
[The bench slides away, and Adult Gumball screams until the bench collides with a bus. Zachariah and Bexi are seen riding a swan-shaped boat]
Gumball as Zachariah: I'm sorry, but this is moving too fast for me.
[The swan boat speeds off, throwing Zachariah into the water]
Bexi: This bird is out of control!
[The swan boat crashes into a building]
Darwin: Huh, what do you know?
Gumball: And then Yuki said, [Writing] "I'm sorry, but this is moving too fast for me."
[A horse neigh is heard in the distance. Yuki flashes past the turmoil in the streets, riding the same unicorn from before. It then crashes into something offscreen. Many people are shown outside crying. Darwin and Sarah sigh]
Gumball: What?! You think you can just lock three people in a room and pressure them to keep coming up with gold? Eventually they'll start repeating material. I mean, what, you think you can just lock three people in a room and pressure them to keep coming up with gold? Eventually they'll start re- [Gets cut off by pounding on Sarah's door]
Donut Sheriff: Open up!
Darwin: They made it up the stairs!
Sarah: And all we've done is make things worse!
[The chaos outside is seen once again, with something crashing offscreen]
Gumball: Aaaand there's only [Points to empty spot in the notebook] space left for one sentence.
[Doughnut Sheriff kicks a hole through Sarah's door. Gumball, Darwin, and Sarah gasp]
Darwin: What are we gonna do?!
[Sarah then has an idea]
Sarah: I've got an idea.
[Sarah takes the notebook and writes in it. Gumball and Darwin then lovingly look at Sarah]
Gumball: I love you, Sarah!
Darwin: Me too! And without further ado...
[Gumball and Darwin kiss Sarah on either side of her face. They both regain their senses, and then everything around them reverts back to normal. They all look outside to see everything perfectly fine]
Gumball: What the what? How did you do that?
[Sarah tilts the notebook downward so Gumball and Darwin can see the writing]
Darwin: [Reading] "Gumball and Darwin kiss Sarah, but in the end, none of this mattered because it was all just fan fiction!"
Gumball: Ah, genius idea. But, wait, how did us kissing you help that plan?
Sarah: It didn't. [Makes a smug face]
[Episode ends]
