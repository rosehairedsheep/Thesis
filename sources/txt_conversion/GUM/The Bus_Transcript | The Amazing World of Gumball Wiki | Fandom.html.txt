Skipping School
[Episode begins with the bus pulling up to the curb. Rocky opens the door]
Rocky: Hey guys! [To Gumball] Eh, why the long face? Feelin' gloomy?
Darwin: One, his face is long because he tried to stretch his skin to make it look like he's too old to go to school. Two, no, Mom didn't buy it.
Gumball: And three, yes, I'm feeling gloomy.
[Gumball and Darwin get on the bus, and Gumball trips on his own face. The bus drives off]
Rocky: Oh, man, I don't know how you guys do it.
Gumball: Eh, it's not that difficult to learn how to stretch your face. There's an online tutorial for everything nowadays. [To Leslie] So, did you finish...
Rocky: No, I mean I don't know how you go to school every day.
Gumball: Rocky, you drive us there.
Rocky: Well... I don't have to.
Gumball: [Grinning] Reeeeaaaalllyyyy....? [Neck cracks as he turns his head] Aah! Aah...
Rocky: Well, we're on a bus. We could go anywhere.
Darwin: [Excitedly] Like under the sea, or to outer space, or up a rainbow?
Rocky: Well, anywhere with a road. But not up steep hills... or under low bridges.
Gumball: Let's do it! After all, we've got the rest of our lives to go to school.
Alan​​​​​: Well, I think we should go to school, so we can work hard and get the best possible start in li—
Gumball: [Sighs]
[Gumball walks over, pops Alan off-screen and sits back to his seat]
Gumball: Anyone else wanna go to school?
Gumball's classmates: No, no, no no no...
Rocky: Okay! No school it is!
[The bus drives past school]
Rocky: So, where should we go instead?
Teri: Daisyland!
Tobias​​​​​: The beach!
Sussie: The school bus!
Darwin: We're already on the school bus!
Sussie: [Ecstatically] Ya-hah!
Gumball: What about the water park?
[Gumball's classmates chatter in agreement]
Tobias​​​​​: Aww, the beach!
Rocky: Alrighty, we just gotta make one more stop...
[The bus stops and the door opens]
Rocky: [Whispering] Is that all of you, Mr. Pink? [Winks]
Richard: [Off-screen] Almost. Looks like Mr. Yellow didn't make it.
[Bus door closes and drives off. Banana Bob looks on from overpass, using binoculars]
Banana Bob​​​​​: [Chuckles sinisterly] Why catch the bus when the bus can catch you?
[Bob jumps from overpass, but lands on road]
Banana Bob​​​​​: Uh... the binoculars made it look closer than it was. [Looks through binoculars backwards] So I guess it's still quite fa—
[Bob is run over by the bus]
Banana Bob​​​​​: Ugh...
Children in Captivity
[On the bus, the students are still discussing the destination]
Gumball: [To Tobias] Alright, we'll go to the water park, then the beach!
[Tobias opens his mouth to protest, but a foot stomps and startles the students]
Nigel Brown: [Clears throat] Good afternoon, children, my name is Mr. Brown. This is Mr. Pink, Mr. Rainbow, and Mr. White, and we'll be your captors for the day. The exits are... [Loudly] irrelevant, 'cause you're going nowhere!
Richard: Nobody moves, or I'll be forced to use this! [Holds out briefcase]
All students but Gumball: [Gasp] It's a briefcase!
Richard: [Ticking sound comes from briefcase] No, more than that.
All students but Gumball: [Gasp] It's a ticking briefcase!
Richard: No, more than that.
All students but Gumball: [Gasp] It's a bo—
Richard: [Panicking] No no, no no no no no, less than that!
Nigel Brown: Uh, yes, we are legally obliged to say it's not one of those.
All students but Gumball: Oh my gosh, they've got a b— [Cut off by sound of bus]
Gumball: [Sighs] Oh, come on guys. It's obviously not a bo—
Banana Joe: But it's ticking!
Leslie​​​​​: And masked strangers have taken over the bus!
Gumball: But they're clearly our parents trying to teach us some sort of lesson! Principal Brown hasn't even changed his name!
Nigel Brown: Yes I have! I-I mean he has. I-I mean he hasn't...I mean... who is this "Principal Brown"?
Richard: [Whispering] You are!
Nigel Brown: Shh! [Phone vibrates] Oh, uh, yes... [Reading text] We are going to call the cops and tell them we won't release you until our demands are met! Make the call, Mr. Rainbow.
Harold​​​​​: [Whispering] I thought we were gonna disguise my voice!
Nigel Brown: Um...
Dexter: [Sighs] Alright... [Blows air into Harold's mouth]
Harold:​​​​​ [High-pitched voice] Hello, police? We have taken control of the school bus, and you'd better do what we say, or [Voice deepens] there'll be consequences. Oh, sorry...
[Dexter blows air into Harold's mouth again]
Harold:​​​​​ [High-pitched voice] Or there'll be consequences.
Gumball: Oh, come on, Alan. You're telling me you don't even recognize the balloon?
Alan​​​​​: Wait... I do recognize him.
Gumball: Yeah?
Alan​​​​​: I saw him in our house last night!
Gumball: Yeah?
Alan​​​​​: On TV. "Elmore's Most Wanted".
Gumball: [Sighs] It's just our parents trying to teach us a lesson. Like when my dad tried to teach us the dangers of texting while walking.
[Flashback to Gumball and Darwin walking around a manhole and texting, with Richard inside]
Richard: [Fake-sounding voice] Help me! I've fallen down this manhole because I was texting while walking!
[End flashback]
Gumball: Darwin, you can't seriously be scared of these guys!
Darwin: Of course I am! They're criminal masterminds!
Richard: [To other adults] I just think it would be fun, I've never been in a hovercraft.
Dexter: No, we should ask for a private jet. They always ask for a private jet.
Richard: Could it be a private hovercraft?
[Phone vibrates]
Harold​​​​​: [Reads text] We need to ask for money!
Nigel Brown: How much?
Dexter: It doesn't matter, the police know this is all fake!
Gumball: See, they're not scary.
Darwin: [Determined] You're right! We just need a leader to reason with them. [Dramatic music plays] Someone brave.
Gumball: [Clears throat]
Darwin: Someone who's not afraid to look the enemy in the eye!
Gumball: [Clears throat loudly]
Darwin: Someone who laughs in the face of danger!
Gumball: [Clears throat loudly, laughs, then clears throat again]
Darwin: I would say you, Gumball, but you're obviously sick. [Gumball takes offense to this] Hm... maybe Leslie--
Gumball: No! Me! I'll do it!
Richard: Oh, but hovercrafts are... [Gumball taps on Richard's shoulder] Hm?
Gumball: Uh, Dad?
Richard: It's Mr. Pink.
Gumball: [Unimpressed] Fine, Mr. Pink. I know it's you, Dad.
Richard: Uh... [Nervously] I've never heard of this 'dad' of whom you speak. I'm just a criminal. How did I become a criminal, you ask?
Gumball: I didn't ask.
Richard: I suppose it all started when I was eleven years old and skipped a math class.
Gumball: Uh-huh.
Richard: And for this crime, the punishment was harsh and swift. I spent twelve years in juvie, then five years inside, then twenty-four years on the run, then thirty years back in the big house, then a further seven in solitary.
Gumball: That makes you eighty-nine. It doesn't add up.
Richard: [Laughs] Well, I wouldn't know, 'cause I skipped that math class.
Gumball: ...sure. [To other adults] So, I assume you all ended up in a life of crime through skipping school?
Nigel Brown, Dexter, and Harold​​​​​: Uh-huh. Yeah. Mm-hm.
Nigel Brown: Well, uh, my tragic story starts on the right side of the tracks, but boy, it sure doesn't stay there.
Gumball: Yeah, yeah, we get it. [Walks off]
Nigel Brown: But I learned the whole thing! Don't I get to... ohh... [Disappointed]
Gumball: See, I told you: it's a load of hooey.
Police Chase
[Siren sounds come from outside, and a fleet of police cars pursue the bus]
Donut Sheriff: [To the French Fry Cop] Take the wheel and get me closer! [Climbs out window] Closer... closer... closer! [Through speaker] We are willing... [Breaks window] Okay, too close. [Car backs away] We are willing to meet your demands! I'll throw the money over in three, two, one... [Throws money, misses and hits police car]
Police Officer: Aaaagh!
[The cars fly out of control because of the money blinding their view, and they crash into each other]
Donut Sheriff: That one's gonna hurt the taxpayer. Control, we need another million dollars.
Dispatcher: They doubled their demands?
Donut Sheriff: Uh, uh... yeah! They doubled their demands! Uh...
Nigel Brown: Wow, they're really going big on this.
Dexter: If only they responded this fast to real crimes...
Donut Sheriff: Where do you want the money?
Nigel Brown: [Phone vibrates; reading text] Leave the million dollops of unmasked bulls on the cold desert toad!
Donut Sheriff: What?... [Through loudspeaker] What?
Nigel Brown: Oh, sorry, auto-correct. Leave the million dollars of unmarked bills on the old desert road!
Donut Sheriff: All units fall back, ahead of second drop-off.
[The Doughnut Sheriff's cruiser decelerates. At an old desert road, the bus approaches, seen through the point-of-view of some binoculars]
Hamburger Cop: Any sign of him, chief? I'm cooking out here...
[The view goes to a visibly cooking Hamburger Cop with the briefcase]
Coffee Cop: They're on their way. Make the drop.
[Hamburger Cop leaves briefcase on the road and runs off]
Dexter: Okay, you hold onto me, and I'll reach out and grab the briefcase!
[Dexter goes out of bus door but gets caught in wind]
Dexter: Maybe we should switch!
[Dexter gets pulled back and Richard leans out and grabs the briefcase]
Harold​​​​​: Did you get it?
Richard: [Briefcase in mouth] Uh-huh.
Harold​​​​​: [On phone] Okay, we have the money. Now we don't want to see any red lights between here and the airport.
[Lights on street all turn green, and Doughnut Sheriff notices]
Donut Sheriff: They're heading for the airport! We've gotta take 'em down! [Loud voice shatters French Fry Cop]
[Police cars crash into one another as they chase the speeding bus. The "hijackers" open the briefcase and discover real money]
Richard, Nigel Brown, Dexter, and Harold​​​​​: [Gasp]
Dexter: Wait, this wasn't supposed to be real money!
Richard: It was just a trick to teach the kids a lesson!
Gumball: [Walking towards the briefcase] Well, I guess the lesson you've actually taught is that crime does pay. Well done, chaps. You've done good.
Darwin: GET 'EM!
All students but Gumball: AAAAGHH!
[The students charge and take over the adults]
Alan​​​​​: We got 'em!
[They did a poor job, though Alan has tied up Richard and Tobias is holding Dexter by the cord]
Leslie​​​​​: Kinda...
Alan​​​​​: And now to reveal their true identities!
[The students remove their masks. The person in the mask is "revealed" to be Richard]
All students but Gumball: [Gasp]
Darwin: They were our parents all along?!
Gumball: ...Really?
Richard: [Guiltily] You've got me, it's true. I am Richard Wattersonnnnn's EVIL TWIN BROTHER!
Gumball: Give it up, Dad!
Richard: We just wanted to teach you that skipping school isn't cool or exciting.
Gumball: By involving us in a million-dollar high-speed police chase, which is probably the most cool or exciting thing we've ever done?
Nigel Brown: Yes, but we thought it was all going to be pretend! Hang on... if the money's genuine, and the cops are for real... [Holds up ticking briefcase] does that mean this is a real—
Sussie: Bada-BOOM!
[Cut to another outside shot of the bus passing by a neighborhood as the students scream in terror. The briefcase drops to the floor]
Gumball: [Pinching the bridge of his nose in exasperation] Whose insane idea was this?
[Phone vibrates]
Nigel Brown: [Reading text] "Stick to the pan, or everyone dines."
Work of the Wrecker
Rob: [Off-screen] Darn auto-correct...
[Everyone on the bus turns towards him]
Rob: Stupid thing never works. [Sends the message and then stares at everyone awkwardly, realizing he's been caught]
Gumball: [Gasps] Rob?!
Rob​​​​​​​: [Sarcastically] Oh, NOW you remember my name! [Points at Darwin] It's Dr. Wrecker to you, and yes, this whole thing was my idea! All I had to do was suggest the plan to Principal Brown, make sure the police thought it was real, and switch the briefcase for something a little more, shall we say... explosive.
Gumball: But why?!
Rob​​​​​​​: Because... I... am... your... NEMESIS! [Aside] And also for the money...
[The bus drives quickly over a speed bump, throwing everyone into the air and jolting Rocky awake]
Rocky: [Dazed] Sorry, it's kind of hard to keep your eyes on the road when there's a crucial plot twist happening in the back of your bu...
[Rocky passes out on the wheel. With Rocky asleep, the bus begins driving wildly, causing the briefcase to slide over to Rob]
Gumball: The money!
Rob​​​​​​​: [Laughs maniacally]
[The bus continues to veer out of control as the adults try to wake up Rocky]
Donut Sheriff: Wow! These guys are pros! They must have one heck of a wheel-man!
[The adults continue trying to wake Rocky, while a helicopter attempts to lower the Hamburger Cop onto the top of the bus]
Hamburger Cop: Little lower!
[The cop ends up getting caught in a sign, and is flung off]
Airport Showdown
[The bus enters the airport, trailed by the police, and is about to hit a plane, when the plane director, after a moment's time to focus, skillfully directs all the vehicles towards different directions. He blows on, and twirls, his batons like a pistol and holsters them. The plane begins to taxi on the runway. The bus drives towards a different runway, this time with a plane that is about to land. Everyone on the bus, and the two Finger Pilots on the plane, scream, and the pilots quickly pull on the plane's rudder, sending it skywards and making it narrowly miss the bus. Rob and Gumball start to fight; the two initially tug for the briefcase Rob is holding, but Gumball, just as Rob is able to assume full control of his case, picks up the other briefcase, and starts to fight. Outside, the bus is now flanked by two pairs of three police vehicles, with Earl and the Hamburger Cop ready to get inside]
Donut Sheriff: Go go go!
[The two Hot Dog Cops break through the bus windows, though the Hamburger Cop gets stuck. Now inside, the cops apprehend the unmasked adults]
Earl: You are under arrest!
Nigel Brown: [Apprehended by the Hamburger Cop] It wasn't us! [Points to Rob] It was him!
[Rob and Gumball continue fighting. Meanwhile, Rocky wakes up in time to see a plane headed in the bus's direction; he screams and ducks, and everyone screams and ducks as one of the plane's wings crash into the bus, tearing off the roof and taking Gumball and Rob with it. Everyone gets back up, noticing Gumball and Rob isn't there anymore]
Darwin: Gumball!
[Gumball and Rob continue fighting on the wing of the plane]
Gumball: Thanks, man! Fighting on the wing of a plane is way more fun than math class! [hits Rob back]
Rob​​​​​​: This isn't supposed to be fun! [swings at Gumball]
Gumball: Wait, what?! Th... then why are you doing this?!
[As he speaks, Rob continues to swing his briefcase, which Gumball dodges]
Rob​​​​​​: Because I'm a villain! What choice do I have? All I've got on my résumé is laughing maniacally, monologuing about evil plans; got a major in Canadian History. I can't exactly go into catering! [Hits Gumball off the plane with the briefcase; now on the ground] And now, Gumball Watterson... PREPARE TO BE WRECKED!
[Rob stops as he notices the cops arriving and running towards them; he and Gumball turn their heads to look at them, Rob especially in a state of worry and Gumball in befuddlement. Beat]
Rob​​​​​​: Oh, officer! Help me! He's got a ticking briefcase!
Gumball: [Getting up] Oh, come on, these are professional law enforcers. As if they're gonna fal— [They pounce and put handcuffs on Gumball]
Donut Sheriff: You're coming with us!
[Seeing his arch-nemesis get cuffed, Rob takes the time to escape with the briefcase]
Gumball: [Grunting] No, no, wait!
Nigel Brown: No no, not him, the other one! [Points to Rob]
Gumball: [As he is uncuffed] It's too late now! He's gone away with the money...
Richard: No, he hasn't. That's the money. [Points to the briefcase on the ground] It's got my teeth marks in it.
[Gumball opens the briefcase, revealing it does have the real money]
Donut Sheriff: Ah, we got the money back. He got away, but my shift ends in five minutes, so shall we say case closed? [Closes the briefcase]
Gumball: But... if this is the money, doesn't that mean that Dr. Wrecker has the—
[An explosion in the background sends Rob flying towards the  Doughnut Sheriff's car; Rob does have the ticking briefcase]
Donut Sheriff: Well there's only one thing left to say. You are...
Rob​​​​​​: I know, I know... I'm wrecked.
Donut Sheriff: I was gonna say you're under arrest.
Rob​​​​​​: Oh, yes, that makes more sense...
[Rob slams his face into the car as the episode ends]
