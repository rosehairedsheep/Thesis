The Big Fuss
[The episode starts with Richard, Anais, Darwin, and Gumball on a couch. Richard scoops into an ice cream bucket and feeds Gumball, Darwin, Anais, and himself. The camera cuts to show Nicole standing right next to them with a stern expression.]
Gumball, Darwin, Anais, and Richard: [Shocked] Mom!
[Anais points to Nicole and puts her fingers above her eyes, mimicking brows furrowing in anger.]
Richard, Gumball, and Darwin: [Nod] Mm-hmm.
[Gumball makes a scissors gesture with his hand, as if trimming his hair.]
Nicole: No, I didn't get a new haircut.
[The family thinks. Anais gasps, then makes a gesture of someone waxing their mustache.]
Nicole: No, I'm not desperately trying to get noticed for waxing my mustache.
[They think again. Darwin gasps and then smiles widely, showing his teeth.]
Nicole: No, I haven't had my dentures whitened, and I don't wear dentures! And by the way, I can plainly see you're all miming so just man up and ask.
Gumball: [Inhales sharply] What did we do wrong?! [Whines]
Nicole: It might be that a certain someone forgot a certain something.
Gumball: Uh, you're being a bit hypocritical here. You can't be angry at someone for forgetting something if you can't even remember their name or what they forgot.
Nicole: [Inhales] It's fine, no need to make a fuss about it.
[Nicole walks to the kitchen then sticks out her head.]
Nicole: Oh, I got it. There must be some secret fuss that I shouldn't know about! [Winks]
Gumball: No, there is no fuss.
Nicole: [Chuckles] No fuss. Got it.
Gumball: No, seriously, there is no fuss. You just said you didn't want a fuss. Also, what is all this fuss about?
Nicole: Sure, you didn't organize any fuss.
Gumball: I'm not bluffing. There's no fussing.
[The doorbell rings]
Nicole: Oh, I wonder who this could be! [Opens the door] Oh! A sing-a-gram!
Gary: Uh... [Sings]
Hello, my darling,
Hello, my baby,
This is from the IRS.
You better pay it, they're getting serious,
Your home will be repossessed.
[Speaks] There you go.
Nicole: What? [Gasps as she sees a bunch of balloons] A party! I knew it! Yay! [Runs to the balloons, stops upon seeing their faces. It is Alan and his family, in front of a hearse.]
Alan​​: Even acupuncture couldn't save him.
[Nicole sighs while heading back to the house. She then notices an airplane towing an "IT'S A SPECIAL DAY..." banner flying overhead.]
Nicole: "It's a special day!" Aww! [Reads the banner again] "Get twenty-five percent off at Dave's Skywriting Emporium?" Wait, so you really haven't organized anything?
[Richard, Anais, Gumball, and Darwin shake their heads.]
Nicole: Oh. Okay.
Nicole: [Walks into the house depressed.] It's all right. I-it's quite alright, really. Don't make a fuss.
Richard: Okay then.
[Nicole sighs]
Anais: Something about her body language tells me she doesn't mean that.
[The camera shows that Nicole is lying face down on the kitchen floor.]
Gumball: Yep. Pack your bags, we're about to go on a round-the-world guilt trip. Unless we figure out what we should be making a fuss about.
[Outside, Nicole walks to the clothes wire, and sighs as the wind whistles, the thunder booms and it starts raining.]
Nicole: Dirty socks and filthy clothes,
When all I wanted was a sweet red rose. 
And how could anyone forget,
Or fail to see why I'm upset?
He made me laugh with things he said,
But now he can't remember the day we—
[The music stops, revealing that it was just Anais turning on a fan as the wind, Darwin holding an umbrella for shade, Gumball using a water hose for the rain, and Richard holding a radio that shorts out and catches on fire.]
Richard: Aaaah! Gumball! Put out the fire!
[Gumball points the water hose at Richard causing him to get electrocuted.]
Anais: [Drops the fan toward Darwin as she runs to them.] No, don't! [Pushes Gumball while Darwin is flying away with his umbrella until he lets go of it.]
[Richard, Anais, Gumball and Darwin fall and lie on the ground.]
Gumball: [Spits out grass] The song! Finish the song!
Nicole: No, a certain someone should know why today is important.
Gumball: Why did you say we shouldn't be making a fuss if you get all angry about it when we don't?
Nicole: "No need to make a fuss" is a thing people say, but they obviously don't mean it. It's all in the subtext, like when someone says, "I'm only two minutes away."
[A subtext appears with the sentence; "I'm still in my pajamas."]
Nicole: "We should stay in touch."
[Another subtext appears; "I've already forgotten about you."]
Nicole: Or, "It's fine, honey."
[Another subtext appears again; "You have five minutes left to live."]
Gumball: Uh, okay. So are you gonna tell us what we should be celebrating?
Nicole: Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
[As Nicole walks by, a subtext appears once again; "May the universe have mercy on you." Gumball looks at the subtext, worried.]
Today Is the Day
[Inside the house, Gumball and his siblings along with their father are decorating the house as if there is a celebration party.]
Darwin: It's kind of difficult to organize a party if we don't know what it's for. What's appropriate? Cake? What if it's the anniversary of some tragedy? A black cake?
Richard: Let's keep it as vague as possible. Like this, look. [Shows the banner he hung up] "Today is the day."
Gumball: Uh, do I draw a smiley face on the card or not?
Richard: Make it both!
Gumball: [Scribbles then shows Richard his drawing of a face that can be both happy or sad by rotating the paper.]
Richard: Mm. [Makes a thumb up]
Gumball: [Turns Richard's thumb sideways] Keep it neutral.
[Meanwhile, Anais blows up a beige balloon.]
Richard: Good choice! Beige, the Wednesday of colors. Like a visual muzak. As noncommittal as can be.
Gumball: Okay, I'll be Mom coming in. [Walks backward to the kitchen] Everyone, try and look as bland as possible. [He re-enters while covering his eyes and gasps only to find out Darwin, Anais and Richard are making the poker face.] I feel nothing. It's perfect.
[Door opens]
Gumball: [Gasps] She's coming! Get ready to sing the everything song!
[Joins his siblings and dad while making the same face as them.]
Nicole: [Sees them and gasps excitedly.]
Richard, Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: [Sing]
[to the tune of For He's A Jolly Good Fellow]
Today's so very important,
it doesn't come very often,
For reasons you thought we'd forgotten,
Today is all about you.
It's such an important day,
it's such an important day.
[to the tune of Happy Birthday To You]
Happy today to you,
happy today to you.
Happy today, dear Nicole.
Unless it's kind of sad, too.
[to the tune of Funeral March]
This day for you,
is important for us too.
A sad and serious day,
unless you want us to say hooray.
[to the tune of We Wish You A Merry Christmas]
We know this idea is not strong,
this is clearly a Christmas song.
We can't keep this up for too long,
so tell us what's wrong.
[Smile nervously]
Brain Power
[Nicole walks up to them with an angry face and Gumball gives her the drawing he made earlier.]
Nicole: "With deepest feelings on this momentous occasion." Smooth. [Tears the drawing into pieces furiously]
Gumball: We baked you a cake.
Nicole: [Enters the kitchen] Really?! [Returns carrying a cake adorned with a shrugging gingerbread man. She glares at Richard and drops the cake on the floor before storming away.]
Gumball: Dad, she was looking you right in the eye. It's you who's forgotten something! What is it?
Richard: Okay. Let me think. [Inhales deeply and strains]
Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: [Gasp]
Richard: [Pants as he begins sweating profusely]
Gumball: W-what's going on?
Richard: [Mumbles incoherently]
Anais: I think he's using his brain!
[The veins on Richard's forehead start to bulge, and he roars.]
Anais: This is dangerous! He's pushing way past his usual limits!
[Richard yells and clutches his face as if he was in extreme pain, then he destroys a lamp.]
Darwin: Aaah!
[A vein bulges in Richard's forehead as he grabs and rips off the curtains.]
Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: Aaah!
Richard: Aah! Ooh! Ooh! Aah!
[His head swells and pulses grotesquely and he falls to the ground, breaking the coffee table in the process.]
Darwin: He's not gonna make it!
Gumball: [Holds him back] No, Darwin. He has to do this.
Richard: Aaah! Ooh! Ooh! Aaah!
[Richard manages to activate some brain cells.]
Richard: [Gasps] I got it.
Anais: What is it?
Richard: We ask for a clue!
[The kids groan while Anais walks to the kitchen.]
Why Is Today Special?
[In the kitchen, Nicole is rapidly cutting vegetables, as well as the chopping board, with a knife.]
Anais: Can you please just tell us why today is so special so this family can get back to functioning in its usual dysfunctional way?
Nicole: [Sighs] It's November first. Our wedding anniversary.
Anais: [Stares at the calendar stuck to the fridge and pulls it down.] Hmm...Since when do swans have nipples?
[Richard is bawling in the living room while Gumball is thinking of something.]
Gumball: Dad, there's only one way to save the day— with a totally over-the-top, disproportionate, overblown gesture.
Richard: [Sniffles] You're right! I don't know what's so special about October eleventh, but I know it's an important day to your mother, so I'm going to make sure I never forget it again.
Darwin: How?
Anais: Hmm... [Studies the calendar, then rotates her head. She sees that the swan is actually an elephant upside down. On the top 11-01 is only 10-11] That's not a swan. It's an elephant.
Nicole: What are you talking about?
Anais: [She rotates her head back to normal] Well, didn't you ever wonder why we went on summer vacation in January? The calendar was upside down! Today is October eleventh, not November first!
Nicole: [Gasps]
A Big Gesture
[Meanwhile, in the living room]
Richard: I'm going to get a tattoo of October eleventh on my butt!
Darwin: Okay, a tattoo is a big commitment. You should probably think about it for—
[Gumball and Darwin hear a car horn outside as Richard drives away.]
Nicole: So, it turns out I was— [Mumbles]
Gumball: What?
Nicole: You know, I was— [Mumbles]
Anais: [Sighs] She thought today was their wedding anniversary, but it isn't. She's trying to say she was wrong, but her mouth is pathologically incapable of saying those words.
Gumball: Well, I hope her legs are capable of making up for it.
Nicole: What? Why?
[The scene switches to the tattoo parlor.]
Cowboy: It looks just like her, thanks.
Richard: I'd like this [Shows a paper with "10.11"] on that. [Points at his butt]
Tattoo Artist: Uh-huh.
[The scene was paused and divided into two sides. The left side is showing Nicole and the kids, while the right side is showing Richard and the Tattoo Artist.]
[Nicole, Gumball, Darwin and Anais get into the car. Nicole starts the engine and presses the fuel pedal, the car moves but they crash into the front of a bus unexpectedly.]
Gumball: What are you doing?!
Nicole: I couldn't see ahead!
Gumball: Then we're gonna have to run.
[Nicole and the kids run on the sidewalk with Anais in the lead until she crashes into a lamppost.]
Richard: Ow! It hurts so bad! Oh no, no, no, no! I can't do it! It's too painful!
Tattoo Artist: Dude, I assure you, that's a reasonable price for a tattoo.
[Richard pays the fee with his credit card then pulls down his pants.]
[Anais is lying on the ground while Nicole helps her to get up, then Gumball puts her front tooth back into her gums. They continue their journey at a slower pace, putting their hands in front of them so that they don't bump into anything but Gumball accidentally touches something.]
Gumball: Aw, please don't be a butt, please don't be a butt, please don't be a butt. Ah, thank you universe. [Sees that the thing he touched is a butt-headed guy and shivers.]
Dr. Butt: Technically, that's my face.
[Gumball is disgusted so he rubs his hand off on something offscreen.]
Dr. Butt: Uhh, that's my butt.
Gumball: [Sighs].
Darwin: Let's go this way! We can see where we're going in this direction!
[They continue their run by heading toward the screen.]
[The tattooing is about to start.]
Richard: Wait!
Tattoo Artist: What?
Richard: You're holding it upside down. [Rotates the paper upside down, showing the number 10.11, then he laughs.] Almost got the date wrong there.
[Both of them laugh.]
Nicole: Where is it?
Gumball: By the strip mall, somewhere on the left.
Nicole: [Turns her head to the left] I can't see anything! [Grunts and kicks through the divide, revealing the entire screen. However in doing so, she inadvertently hits the Hamburger Cop.] Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.
Hamburger Cop: Wait, I gotta write you a ticket before I forget what happened.
[As the Hamburger Cop takes out his pen and notebook, he falls to the ground unconscious. Nicole, Darwin, Anais and Gumball look at each other, shrug, and run away. Finally at the tattoo parlor, Nicole bursts through the door and startles the Tattoo Artist.]
Nicole: Stop!
Tattoo Artist: Why?
Nicole: Where's my husband?!
Richard: [Speaks with a muffled voice] I'm here! [Waves at Nicole from under the glass door]
Nicole: [Lifts the door off of Richard] Oh, I uh... Here. [Helps him to his feet] What have you done?
Richard: Ahh, don't worry honey.
Nicole: Oh thank goodness you didn't go through with it.
Richard: Ha no, I totally went through with it. I just meant that he gave me a discount so you don't need to worry about the price. [Unzips his pants, pulls down his underwear and shows Nicole the tattoo.]
Nicole: Oh Richard.
Richard: [Pulls up his underwear and pants] Now I'll never forget what day it is. I will always look at this and think, "I wonder what day that is?" forever.
Nicole: But I was wro— [Mumbles]
Richard: Huh?
Gumball: She messed up with the date and she was wrong.
Richard: [Gasps then laughs] Well, that's a day to remember.
Nicole: [Grunts sheepishly]
[The Choices start playing]
Richard: Aw! Just kidding. [Hugs Nicole] I know exactly how to fix this.
Nicole: How?
[The Tattoo Artist needles Richard's butt.]
Richard: Now I'll never forget to think about you every day. What do you think?
Nicole: Hmm. [Smiles] I love it.
[The camera shows the new tattoo with the numbers altered to say "LOVE".]
[The episode ends.]
