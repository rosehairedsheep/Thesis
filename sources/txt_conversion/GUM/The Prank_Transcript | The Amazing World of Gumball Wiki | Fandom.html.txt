Breakfast with Richard
[Richard, Darwin, and Gumball are having breakfast]
Gumball: Hey, Dad, can you pass the sugar?
Richard: [Giggles] Sure, Gumball. [Gives him the vessel] Here's the sugar. [Laughs softly]
[Gumball pours the sugar onto his cereal, takes a bite, and then vomits it on Darwin]
Darwin: It probably just needs more sugar. [Pours more]
[Richard laughs softly; Gumball takes another bite, but vomits it on Darwin again, much longer than before. Darwin then blocks the vomit with newspaper, which the vomit breaks through, and then a spoon, before Gumball stops vomiting]
Gumball: [With puckered lips] This tastes terrible.
Darwin: [Tastes it] It tastes like salt.
Richard: [Laughs loudly] That's because I swapped the sugar for the salt! [Laughs softly] It was the greatest prank ever.
Gumball: [His lips go back to normal] Okay, you got me. But that's not the greatest prank, this is. [Handles a ketchup bottle and points to Richard] Hey, Dad, does this ketchup look funny to you?
Richard: Hmm... I'll check. But afterwards, don't forget to show me that prank you were talking about. [Checks the ketchup bottle] Looks okay to me... [Gumball sprays the ketchup in his face] Aah!
[Gumball and Darwin laugh]
Richard: What'd you do that for? You got ketchup all over me.
Gumball: That was the prank.
Darwin: Yeah, we did it because it's funny.
Richard: [Feels sad] No, it isn't. It's only funny when it happens to someone else! How could you do this to your own father?! [Runs away from Gumball and Darwin, crying]
Nicole: [Appears from the kitchen] That wasn't very nice. You two should know better.
Gumball: What?! You didn't tell him off for pranking us.
Nicole: You know it's too late for your father. I want you two to apologize by the time I get back. [Leaves the house]
Darwin: Do you think Mr. Dad will be okay?
Gumball: Eh, he probably forgot about it already.
Failed Prank
[Gumball and Darwin are now playing their game. Soon, Richard comes by]
Richard: [Hides something behind his back] Hello, children.
Gumball and Darwin: Hey, Dad.
Richard: [Shows two new pairs of shoes; one red, and one green] Why don't you try on these lovely new shoes?
Gumball: [Feeling suspicious of Richard] This is a prank, isn't it?
Richard: [Nervously] What? Pra— prank? What? Me prank you? What? No. Ha, ha. No. [Stutters nervously] Hmph! Sheesh.
[Scene cuts to Richard at the shoe store with both shoes in his hands]
Richard: I would like to return these shoes, please.
Larry: Unfortunately, sir, you seem to have filled them with baked beans.
Richard: [Angrily] I did nothing of the sort, sir!
Larry: Well, I'm sure you wouldn't mind putting them on and taking a walk to prove it, huh?
Richard: And I'm sure I wouldn't mind either. [Puts the shoes on, steps on the baked beans, wriggles and shivers] On second thought, I think I shall keep them. I happen to have grown quite attached to them. [Walks away with a squishy sound coming from his feet]
Prank Tutorial
[Richard is at the couch with a tape player and headphones on his head, presses the play button]
Recording: Welcome to "Pranks for Beginners." Over the next thirty minutes—
Richard: [Pauses the tape] Thirty minutes?! That's two subs, a muffin, and a tub of ice cream. Oh! And I better get a sausage for the last nineteen seconds.[Leaves the room]
[Gumball and Darwin change the tape]
Richard: [Comes back to the room] Mental note: next time, take food for the journey back as well. [Puts the headphones back on and presses the play button]
Gumball [On tape]: Step one: Go out onto the roof of the house.
[Richard is on top of the roof while Gumball and Darwin are hiding behind the car]
Gumball [On tape]: Step two: Take off all of your clothes.
[Gumball and Darwin snicker. Richard has only his underwear on]
Gumball [On tape]: Step three: Pretend that you're are a ballerina while repeatedly slapping yourself in the face.
[Gumball and Darwin are still snickering]
Darwin: Dude, this cannot be real.
Richard: [On his toes and slapping himself] I'm a ballerina!  I'm a ballerina! I'm a ballerina! I'm a ballerina!
Gumball [On tape]: Step five: Realize you've just been pranked. [Richard frowns] Step six: Try and fit down the chimney, head first. [Richard smiles]
[Gumball and Darwin are still snickering while Richard is struggling to get down through the chimney. The day then turns night, with Richard still stuck in the chimney]
The Next Prank
[Scene cuts to Richard on the table snoring, with prank drafts all around him on the table and the floor]
Gumball: Aww, look, he's been up all night trying to find a way to get back at us.
Darwin: [Slaps Richard] Yup, he is definitely out cold.
[Gumball and Darwin grin mischievously; scene changes to them pushing Richard out into a river on an inflatable lifeboat]
Gumball: I can't wait to see the look on his face when he wakes up.
[Gumball and Darwin laugh as Richard floats away]
Gumball: [Stops laughing] Dude, I don't think he's waking up.
Darwin: Where does this river go?
Gumball: Uh... I think it goes out to sea?
[Scene changes to Richard on the lifeboat floating on the sea]
Darwin: Do you think he'll be mad, Gumball?
Gumball: Nah, it's just a small...harmless...prank.
[Scene zooms out, showing Richard on the lifeboat floating further into the sea]
Back at Home
[Gumball and Darwin are watching TV together. The front door then opens and a sunburnt, naked Richard walks in, holding the lifeboat. He appears to be angry]
Gumball: [Door opens] Dad! Are you okay? Can I get you something to eat or something?
Richard: No, I still have plenty of coconuts. [Holds up a bag of coconuts]
Darwin: What happened to your clothes?
Richard: I ate them! [Turns around, showing his butt, and walks up the stairs]
Darwin: How do we know when we've taken this too far?
Gumball: I think we'll know when we get there.
Richard's Door Prank
[Gumball and Darwin are scribbling on a magazine with crayons, then the camera zooms out, showing Richard placing a bucket full of water on top of the kitchen door. Gumball and Darwin notice Richard's prank]
Gumball: This is just too easy.
[Scene changes to kitchen]
Gumball: Dad!
Richard: [Gasps, then pulls out his newspaper]
Gumball: Hey, Darwin and I are thinking of going outside.
Richard: Oh, okay.
Gumball: Shall we going to the front yard or the backyard?
Richard: [Giggles] The backyard! It's always nice at this time of the year. [Continues to giggle]
Gumball: [faces to Darwin] Hey... Do you know what else would be fun?
Darwin: What?
Gumball: Going through...the window.
Richard: [Folds the newspaper quickly as he thinks his prank will be useless] What are you talking about?! Are you crazy?!
Gumball: Well, how else are we gonna get to the backyard?
Richard: Through the door!
Gumball: The what?
Richard: The door! Like this. [His prank backfires. The bucket falls onto him] Waah! [He runs out of the kitchen shouting, crashing into things]
[Scene changes to the ambulance siren]
Paramedic: Sir, please stop struggling so we can get the bucket off.
Richard: It's dark!
Paramedic: How did this happen?
Gumball: Well, we saw our dad putting the bucket on top of the kitchen door and...
Richard: You saw me?! How can you do this to me. You betrayed me, my own children! I look like a fool! [Starts running all over the place] I don't want anyone to see me like this!
Paramedic Eddie: Sir, please calm down.
Richard: [Shouting] Leave me alone! Get off my lawn!
Paramedic: It's no use. Eddie, tranquilizer.
Paramedic Eddie: [Blows a tranquilizer on Richard's butt]
Richard: Leave... me... alone... [Yawns and falls asleep, allowing the bucket to be removed from his head]
I'm Gonna Prank You
[Scene changes back into the Wattersons' house. Richard's pops his head back in shape]
Gumball: Hey dad! So... things got a little carried away there. What with you know, you going out to sea, and... getting tranquilized and.. everything... So it was a lot of fun but I think it's about time to call it a day. Okay?
[Richard doesn't respond]
Darwin: Yeah, I think we all learnt a valuable lesson about not taking pranks too far. Let's have a feel-good hug.
[Gumball and Darwin hug Richard, but Richard still does not respond]
Darwin: This doesn't feel like a happy ending.
[Richard cuts Gumball and Darwin out from the family photo]
Darwin: [Whispers to Gumball] What are we gonna do?
Gumball: [Whispers to Darwin] I don't know. [Thinks for a few seconds, then sees a bucket on top of the door] Huh? Maybe we should just go outside again, this time through the front door.
Darwin: Good idea, Gumball!
Gumball: Okay, prepare to get wet. [Opens door, but the bucket containing dried concrete falls in front of Gumball and Darwin almost hitting them] What the what?!
Richard: [Turns around, looking insane] I'm gonna prank you! [Jumps out of sofa, making "scary" crazy faces]
[Gumball and Darwin scream in fear, run up the stairs into the bathroom and shut the door, while Richard bangs on the door]
Darwin: [Notices Gumball panicking] Gumball! What's wrong with you? You're hyperventilating! Stop panicking Gumball, just calm down. Get [Slaps] a [Slaps] grip [Slaps], snap [Slaps] out [Slaps] of [Slaps] it! [Slaps]
Gumball: Cut it out! You're making it worse!
Darwin: Oh, sorry. There, there, buddy, [Strokes Gumball] there, there. Is that better?
Gumball: Much better. Now hold me and tell me that everything is going to be okay.
Darwin: [holds Gumball] Everything is gonna be okay, buddy.
Gumball: How about a little kiss? [puckers lips]
[Darwin kisses Gumball on the cheek]
Gumball: [Relieved] Hah.
Richard: [Crashes into the bathroom] Prank time!
[Gumball and Darwin scream, and run out of the bathroom and down the stairs, hiding under the sofa. Gumball hyperventilates again]
Richard: [Breaks through the ceiling] Where are you?
Darwin: We're not under the sofa.
[Gumball facepalms]
Richard: Ha-ha! [Flips the sofa up, only to find Gumball and Darwin gone] Huh? [Looks at the TV] Hmm...
Gumball: [Realizes that Richard has spotted them] And that's it for tonight's news at five. Here's Garbin with the weather.
Darwin: It would be very hot here with temperatures soaring to twenty degrees celsius, below zero on the Northern front of the warm drift with isolating regions of the cold snaps! [Beat] And there will be a beautiful rainbow.
Richard: Hmm. I wonder what else is on TV. [Uses the remote to change the channel]
Gumball: [As an actor] How could you?!
Darwin: [As an actor] It's not what it looks like! Please, don't leave me!
Gumball: [As an actor] Nooo! It can never be the same again!
[Richard changes the channel again]
Darwin: [As an documentarian] And here, captured on film for the first time, we see the chicken crab.
Gumball: [Acts as a chicken crab, squawking like a chicken and clicking like a crab]
[Richard changes the channel one more time]
Gumball: [Rapping] A music video, a music video.
Darwin: [Rapping] Yeah, we are in a music video!
Gumball: [Rapping] This is what you call a music video.
Darwin: [Rapping] Oh, baby, we're singing, I am in a [Richard holds up an unplugged TV cord, seeing them] music videooooo...
Gumball: Run.
[Gumball and Darwin continue running around the house with Richard chasing them]
Richard: [Laughs maniacally]
[Gumball and Darwin hide in the kitchen and Richard scares them. They run upstairs]
Gumball: Look! The air vent, it's the only way. [Squeezes into the vent] It's no use. [Holds up Tomato Ketchup bottle as Richard charges towards them] Stand back! I'm warning you. You leave me no choice! [squeezes bottle, but the ketchup splats onto Gumball and Darwin's faces instead] Ahh...
Richard: [Laughs] You should see your faces, you really thought I was going to catch you. [Laughs]
Darwin: What? You mean that the whole thing was a prank?
Richard: Yea. And you totally bought it. [Laughs]
Gumball: Dad! That was terrible. How can you do that to your own children?
Richard: It's always funny when the jokes are on someone else. [Laughs]
Darwin: You almost dropped the block of solid concrete on our head!
Richard: Yeah. I have no idea what happened with that. It was wet when I poured it in.
Gumball: And the bursting through walls and stuff?
Richard: I'll be honest with ya', I broke five ribs, but it was all worth it, just to see your faces.
Gumball: Good job, Dad, you totally got us, we're sorry we pranked you.
Richard: Wahaha, no, it's me that should be sorry.
Darwin: But it was us who took it too far.
Richard: Yeah, but I was the one who started it.
[Nicole and Anais come back and are shocked by the destruction the boys made]
Nicole: Who...did...this?!
Gumball, Darwin, and Richard: [They point at each other] It was him!
