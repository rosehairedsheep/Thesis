On the Street
[Gumball, Darwin and Anais are on the sidewalk in front of the Robinsons' house]
Darwin: What do you wanna do today, Gumball?
Gumball: I'm waiting right here for Mom to drive me to "Elmore Senior Talent Show." [Looks at pamphlet] Mr. Robinson's headlining.
Anais: But it doesn't start for another ten hours.
Darwin: And you're not invited. [points at pamphlet, it reads: STRICTLY NO GUMBALL]
Gumball: I don't care! Tonight's the biggest night of Mr. Robinson's life and I have to be there!
[Camera changes to the Robinsons' car]
Gaylord: [exhales relaxed] Tonight's the night, Margaret. This town is finally going to see the real Gaylord Robinson.
Margaret: [grunts]
Gaylord: Why can't you ever be happy for me?...
[Camera changes back to Gumball, Darwin and Anais]
Darwin: [points at car] There he is now!
[The Robinsons' car passes by and then goes in reverse, Darwin and Anais get on the sidewalk]
Gumball: [screams in fear, as the car goes slowly in reverse to park] Save yourselves! It's too late for me!
Darwin: Just get over on the sidewalk, dude.
Gumball: Please remember me, guys, so I'll always be alive in your heart. [cries]
Gaylord: Oh, for crying out loud...! [honks]
Gumball: My whole life is flashing before my eyes! And it's boring! [screams]
[Mr. Robinson brakes and parks]
Gumball: Huh?
Gaylord: Darn kids.
[Gumball jumps on the windscreen]
Gumball: [cheers up] You saved my life, Mr. Robinson!
Gaylord: I didn't save your life. I just didn't run you over! NOW GET OUT OF MY WAY!!
Gumball: No way. I am not leaving your side until I've saved your life in return.
Gaylord: Get off my car! [turns on windscreen wiper]
Gumball: [face being wiped] I'll never...ever...leave...your...side!
Gaylord: [turns off windscreen wiper] Don't make me shout at you. I gotta save my voice for tonight.
Margaret: [grunts, opens the hood]
[Gumball is launched to the space because of this]
The Debt
Gumball: Woo! [gets in a praying position] Oh, dear Universe above me, thank you for the gift of Mr. Robinson. I swear on my life, I will repay this debt. [falls back to Earth]
[The Moon and Saturn turn around]
The Moon: What did he say?
Saturn: I don't know. Whose turn is it, anyway?
The Moon: Hmm, mine. I spy with my lil' eye...
At the Robinsons'
[Gumball is at the door, lying like a dog]
Gaylord: [warms up his voice] Well, Margaret, since you won't take care of my precious instrument, [goes out the house] I'll get the cough drops myself... [stumbles over Gumball and falls] What are you doing here?
Gumball: [gets up] I'm here to save your life!
Gaylord: [gets dust off his clothes, whispering] Not today of all days. [in a normal tone] Just get away from me, kid. I mean it!
Hazardous Objects
[Mr. Robinson walks along a corridor, there's a "Slippy Floor" sign]
Gaylord: [grabs a bottle] Here they are. [reads the label] Antiseptic action...
Gumball: [referring to the sign] What's this hazardous object doing in the middle of the floor? [takes the sign and carries it away] Mr. Robinson can trip over it. There. Safely out of the way.
Gaylord: [slips on a puddle right there where the sign stood] Whah, no!
Gumball: Ah! [runs up to Mr. Robinson] Mr. Robinson! He's out cold! Woo! [cheers up] Now's my chance to save him!
[Pantsbully stops Gumball]
Pantsbully: Step aside. I know CPR. [proceeds to do it]
Gaylord: Uh? [Pantsbully is about to do CPR] No, no, no!
[Pantsbully does it twice while Mr. Robinson struggles to get away]
The Coffee Machine
[Mr. Robinson approaches a coffee machine while coughing]
Gaylord: I sure hope that hasn't affected my vocal cords. [picks a coffee, warms his voice] La, la, la [coughs sharply to clean his throat]
Gumball: [runs towards Mr. Robinson] Mr. Robinson, you're choking! [does him the Heimlich Maneuver]
Gaylord: Gumball! What the...?
[Mr. Robinson's heart falls out from his mouth]
Gaylord: [breathless] That's my heart... [falls, inhales sharply, grabs his heart with his tongue and swallows it, inhales alleviated and sits up]
Gumball: [happily] So, I saved your life, right?
Gaylord: [angrily] NO, you darn near ended it! Now leave me alone!
At the Tan Salon
Gaylord: [sitting on a tanning machine] Uah! A healthy glow will make me look my best for tonight. [lies and closes the tanning machine]
Gumball: Uh! Mr. Robinson! [desperate] Oh, no! I'm too late! Why wasn't I here to save you? Why?! [bangs on the tanning machine, then falls on his face crying] [perks up] No! NO! I refuse to let you go! [opens the tanning machine] He looks so peaceful... [grabs a defibrillator] CLEAR! [zaps Mr. Robinson]
Gaylord: What do you think you're doing?!
Gumball: [happily] I'm bringing you back to life!
Gaylord: But I was alive!
Gumball: Better safe than sorry!
Gaylord: NO!
[Gumball zaps Mr. Robinson with the defibrillator again, lights go out]
At the Robinsons'
[Gumball is at the front door smiling, Mr. Robinson arrives]
Gumball: Welcome home, Mr. Robinson! I booby-trapped your front door!
Gaylord: Why?
Gumball: To protect you from intruders. All you have to do is ring the doorbell, like so...
Gaylord: Wait, why would an intruder ring the—?
[Gumball rings, a big red ball crashes the front door and hits Mr. Robinson]
Gaylord: Ohh...
Gumball: Are you okay?
Gaylord: Listen, kid. This is the most important night of my life. I’m gonna shine... like a star! And I don't want you around to ruin it!
Gumball: But I've gotta be there! To save your life!
Gaylord: Just leave me alone, kid. [almost crying] Just leave me alone!
[Gumball sadly goes and sits on the stairs]
Gumball: [exhales] I'll never repay my debt to Mr. Robinson... I failed you, Universe! [cries]
[Darwin and Anais lean out of the fence]
Anais: [with tears] Poor Gumball...
Darwin: What can we do to help him?
Anais: [excited] I got an idea!
[Darwin throws a brick at Gumball]
Gumball: Ah! [breaks in pain]
Anais: I said throw near him, not at him!
Gumball: Ow! Oh, it's so painful. Oh man, that hurts. Ow, I'll try to walk it off! [back cracks] Ow! Bad idea! Ahh! Owww. [falls on face, cries for a moment, perks up] Oh! There's a note tied to it! [opens the note] Let's see... Mr. Robinson will be... [misreads assassinated a few times] assenominated... assisanattatted... assasina-ta-ta...
Anais: [behind the fence] Assassinated!
Gumball: [realizes] ...assassinated at the talent show! [screaming] This is terrible! [normal] No, wait... [screaming again] This is what I've been waiting for! [knocks the door] Mr. Robinson!
Gaylord: [goes out the door] Well, Margaret, it's nice that you finally decided to show your support for me tonight.
Margaret: [goes out, grunts]
Gaylord: What do you mean you're only coming to see me fail? [goes along with her]
Gumball: Mr. Robinson! [follows him] You can't go to the talent show tonight! [Mr. and Mrs. Robinson drive away] YOU'RE GONNA BE ASSASSINA...! [in a normal tone, with admiration] He's so brave.
The Talent Show
Senior Citizen: Take it away, Bert!
[The Senior Citizens are on stage, Marvin hurts his back finishing the performance]
Gary: [tries to wake up Blue Elephant making a clap-like noise] Wake up!
[The Senior Citizens leave the stage, the camera goes up a little: Darwin and Anais are on a platform at the top of the stage]
Anais: Okay, Darwin, here's the plan [with a graphic explanation] We drop heavy sand bags near Mr. Robinson. Gumball will notice and push him out of the way, just in time to save his life. [finishes the explanation] Got it?
Darwin: Got it! We drop these heavy sand bags on to Mr. Robinson's head.
Anais: No! We don't actually hit Mr. Robinson.
Darwin: Hit Mr. Robinson. Okay, I understand.
Anais: [to herself] Maybe I should try reverse psychology. Okay, Darwin: the plan is we throw all this stuff at Mr. Robinson's head.
Darwin: [shrugs] That's what I've just said.
Anais: [facepalms] Ugh! Just do what I do.
[Darwin facepalms too, Anais looks at him a little upset]
Gumball: [goes down a rope, there isn't enough rope to reach the floor] Oh, man... [drops himself] Ow!
Rocky: [comes to scene] And now, ladies and gentlemen, would you, please, welcome to the stage our second and final act, Mr. Gaylord Robinson! [leaves, (Gumball appears for a moment) then looms for a moment] Good luck, Dad! [leaves stage]
[The curtain rises]
Gaylord: [clears his throat] Up til' now, my life's been good. Treated me well, I can't complain. Met a woman, raised the kid and every day just felt the same. But there's something deep inside of me that always wanted to be free. And now I think the time is right... [his voice gets higher] to show you what I mean! [takes off his clothes and starts singing I Wanna Be Free]
[Mrs. Robinson leaves the seat displeased that her husband has not failed]
Darwin: What's he doing?
Anais: I don't know, but it's pretty good. Now it's our chance to "assassinate" him! [unties the sand bags]
[The bags fall but Mr. Robinson evades them unaware of it with his dance]
Anais: Did Gumball see any of that?
[Gumball looks from side to side backwards the stage]
Darwin: Maybe, he'll notice the trapdoor.
[The trapdoor opens, Mr. Robinson evades it by jumping over as part of the choreography of his dance, Gumball looks out of it for a second and goes down, then it closes, Mr. Robinson's performance continues]
Gumball: [appears between seats] Show yourself, assassin, and fight like a man!
Anais: [with a remote in her hands] Let's try the special effects!
Darwin: [pushes every button on the remote]
Gumball: Under the seats? [looks beneath the seats]
[The stage is full of flares, colour clouds, etc, making Mr. Robinson's performance even better]
Gary: [amazed] Whoa, who is this guy?
Rocky: That's my dad! ROCK ON, DUDE!
Gaylord: I wanna be free... [his voice goes higher, lights shatter, the building's glass shatters, the Robinsons' car window cracks, Mrs. Robinson is sent in a small driving frenzy, which ends with her crashing into a lightpole, breaking it, and having an air bag hit her face. One of the stage lamps starts falling right on Mr. Robinson's head, Gumball sees this and goes in a slow-mo way to save him]
Gumball: [in slow motion] NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
[The camera changes constantly between Mr. Robinson, Gumball and the lamp]
[Gumball falls to the stage before reaching Mr. Robinson but the lamp remains suspended by its wire and stops falling]
Gumball: Mr. Robinson! [the wire is unplugging slowly] Please, come with me now. It's not safe here!
Gaylord: [in a normal tone] No! Go away! [continues singing]
[The lamp finally unplugs but Gumball pushes Mr. Robinson away, saving him]
Gaylord: [realizes what's just happened] Oh, my gosh! You really did... save my life. [angrily] BUT THAT DOESN'T EXCUSE YOU FOR RUINING MY PERFORMANCE!
[Everyone applauds Mr. Robinson]
Darwin: Hurray!
Anais: Awesome, Mr. Robinson!
Rocky: Way to go, dad! [cheers him] Bravo!
Gaylord: [pushes Gumball out of stage] Thank you, everybody! Thank you! Thank you so much! I don't deserve all of this. [the public continues cheering him] Thank you! Thank you! I love you! And your love means so much to me...
Gumball: [the lights in the background turns into the universe scene] Thank you, infinite Universe for sending us our very own star: Mr. Robinson! [activates a toggle unintentionally, shrugs]
Gaylord: Thank you, everybody!
[The platform where Darwin and Anais are standing starts going down, finally crushing Mr. Robinson]
Gaylord: I love you! You put me where I'm today! Thank you so much...
Darwin: Oh, no! I think we squished Mr. Robinson!
Gaylord: [tries to say something]
Anais: Nah, he's okay. Let's go home.
[Anais and Darwin leave happily and the episode ends]
