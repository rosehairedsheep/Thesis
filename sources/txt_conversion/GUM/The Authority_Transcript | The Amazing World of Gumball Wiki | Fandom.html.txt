At the Hospital
[Richard wakes up in the hospital and sees the rest of the Wattersons]
Richard: What happened?
Bandage Doctor: You are very lucky Mr. Watterson, it appears your skull is so thick you were able to survive a half a ton of tiles and a satellite dish falling on your head.
Nicole: Is he going to be okay, doctor?
Bandage Doctor: Apart from being living proof that we're doomed as a species, he's fine, I just need a signature from whoever is responsible for him.
Nicole: Oh that would be me.
Granny Jojo: [Off-screen] I don't think so!
[Camera zooms in Granny Jojo's face]
Granny Jojo: That would be his mother.
Nicole: [Laughs nervously] Granny Jojo, what a pleasure.
Granny Jojo: I wish I could say the same but it seems I have no other choice but to move in and sort out your family which you are clearly incapable of taking care of.
[Nicole gets very angry and starts breathing heavily]
Gumball: [Notices his mother's fury] Uh doctor, what's the cheapest object in this room?
Bandage Doctor: Probably that. [Points to an IV pole]
[Gumball grabs the rack and gives it to Darwin, who passes it on to Nicole; and she bends the pole out of shape effortlessly]
Bandage Doctor: That was still worth about three hundred dollars.
[Nicole sighs and bends the pole back to normal as Jojo shakes her head scornfully]
Crossing the Road
[The Wattersons walk out of the hosiptal]
Gumball: So, Granny Jojo, why are you staying with us?
[The Wattersons stop at a pedestrian crossing]
Granny Jojo: Because someone has to look after your safety, kid.
Nicole: I think they're perfectly safe with me, now look left then right before you cross that road Gumball.
Granny Jojo: No, you look right then left, that way you see the nearest car first.
[Gumball turns left then right]
Nicole: But while you're looking left, something maybe coming from the other direction, look right again, sweetie.
Granny Jojo: No, look left!
[Gumball starts turning left and right repeatedly]
Nicole: Look right.

Nicole: Right!
Granny Jojo: LEFT!
Nicole: RIGHT!
Granny Jojo: LEFT!
Nicole: RIGHT!

Granny Jojo: See, this is exactly the kind of thing I was worried about.
Nicole: How would you know, you're not even tall enough to look out the window!

[Camera zooms out showing Nicole and Granny Jojo]
Nicole: [Angry] What have you done to them? They've all have turned into Richard!
Granny Jojo: Well, at least they're safe!
Nicole: [Gasps] It's because of your parenting that Richard had that accident. Wait, it's because of your parenting that he has no common sense whatsoever, you protected him his entire life, never letting him think for himself, and now he can hardly think at all!
[Scene changes to Richard's brain which is full of static]

Gumball: Oh oh I got it, you forgot your seat belt.
[Everyone agrees and Gumball help to put Richard's seat belt on, then Nicole's car appears; they scream]

[Richard turns around and seats in the right direction]
Richard: Okay, I need a little help here, how do you stop a car?
Darwin: Well it depends, are we moving forward or is the world moving backwards?
Anais: Whatever it is, the answer must be in this car!
Gumball, Darwin, Anais, and Richard: LET'S PUSH ALL THE BUTTONS!
[Everyone pushes a random button and causes the car to do multiple stuff]

[Nicole drives her car ahead of Richard's]
Richard: No no, don't leave us!
[Nicole stops her car in the middle of the expressway, gets out and stands in the middle of the expressway]
Gumball: We've got to stop the car!
Anais: But how?
Darwin: Have you tried saying please?
Gumball: Don't be silly, just do as I do.
[Gumball opens his car door and puts a foot on the road, everyone follows him; their feet get burned; they scream as they put out the flames on their feet]

Gumball, Darwin, Anais, and Richard: [In slow-motion] The brake!
[Richard presses on the brake and everyone screams while Nicole and Granny Jojo brace themselves; the car stops a few inches from Nicole; everyone laughs and then faints]
Granny Jojo: [Gets out of the car and gasps] Nicole, I-I-I'm sorry I ever doubted you, you are a good mother.
Nicole: It's okay to make mistakes if you learn from them Granny Jojo, now if you'll excuse me, I just need to pass out as well.
[Nicole passes out and faceplants into the hood of the car then melts into a blob while Granny Jojo stares in shock; the episode ends]
