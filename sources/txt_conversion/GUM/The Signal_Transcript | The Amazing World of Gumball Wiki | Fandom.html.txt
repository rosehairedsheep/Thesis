Weird Stutter
[The episode starts with Gumball and Darwin at the Elmore Mall; the screen stutters for a brief duration]
Gumball: You’re what?
Darwin: Just trying on hats. I feel like my look is missing a little something.
Gumball: Dude, your look is missing everything except shoes.
Darwin: Exactly. Step one—shoes. [Looking to his shoes] Step two—hat. [Looking to his head]
Gumball: Uh, step two isn’t hat. And for the record, step one is pants.
Darwin: [Wearing a yellow spiky hat] What do you think?
Gumball: Nah. I think it’s a bit eh— [Freezes]
Darwin: You’re right. Too desperate for attention.
[Darwin takes off the hat and looks for another one in the box. Gumball touches his face and looks at his surroundings as Darwin puts on a dark grey hat]
Darwin: Whoo! How about this?
Gumball: Yeah, that one makes looks kind of eh-h-h-h-h-h-h— [Freezes again]
Darwin: Yeah, I get it. [Takes off the grey hat] Too "thinkin’ it’s cool, but lonely at school."
Gumball: [Shaking his head and looking above] What just happened?
Darwin: [Wearing a big brown hat that covers up his whole face] How about this?
Gumball: Well, that makes you look… [Static] [Gumball’s face below changes into a real one]
Darwin: [Gumball turning back to normal and looked worried] Yeah, too Canadian. [Return the hat to the box and pulled out a very small hat and placed on his head] I really like this one, but do you think it makes me look like I have a fat head?
Gumball: I uh-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-hh-h-h-h-h-hh-hh-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h [Static]
Darwin: Don’t spare my feelings. Just tell me. [Static continues. Darwin grows a double chin] Hmm. [Darwin glitches to an angry face] Fine! [Walks away]
Gumball: I like it! Wha- Darwin, where are you going?
Darwin: To the food court! If that's okay with you.
Gumball: No! I d-d-d-d— [Static]
Darwin: Fine! If you think I've got such a fat head, maybe I'll go work out instead.
Gumball: —d-d-d-didn't mean that! Come on! Wait up! Why are you mad at me? [Runs to Darwin] Dude! Hold o-o-o-o---ho---o-o--o-o---[Looks at camera]--o-o [Cries. Static occurs, Gumball's head and body fall onto ground, while legs are floating] Wait, what the? [Legs back on, gets back up and runs after Darwin] Buddy!
[Lost signal displays. Zoom out to reveal that it is the Wattersons' TV]
Richard: [Clunking TV, grunting] Oh! Come on! All right, there's only one thing to do.
Gumball: Dad, have you seen Dar—
[Richard is pushing the couch into the kitchen]
Gumball: Dad, what are you doing?
Richard: The TV was being weird. I'm moving the couch so I can watch the second most interesting thing in this house!
Gumball: What's that?
Richard: The fridge! [Laughs] Pickles...
[Gumball facepalms]
Working Out
[Gumball goes to Darwin, who is about to do pull ups in the doorway]
Gumball: Aw, dude. You don't have to do that, you're not fat at all.
[Darwin breathes heavily, trying to do a pull up while Gumball slowly goes down]
Darwin: What are you doing?
Gumball: Well, you weren't really going up, so I thought I'd better go down. You know, to make you feel better.
Darwin: Ugh! Whatever.
[Metal bar falls off door]
[Darwin gets on bench press]
Gumball: Wait, wait, wait! Whoa, whoa. At least let me dispatch you buddy! Safety first!
Darwin: [Scoffs] Alright, I guess. [Inhales deeply, grabs barbell, tries to lift it] One! [Straining] A quarter! A-a Half! A third! TAKE IT! TAKE IT!
Gumball: Okay, I gooo-o--o---o----o-----o [Static]
[Darwin drops barbell, making it fall on his face, shoes pop off and break the window. After a while, he manages to lift the barbell off his face]
Gumball: -ayay I got it!
[Gumball accidentally pushes the barbell between Darwin's head and legs, causing the bench press to break in half]
[In the bathroom]
Gumball: [puts bandage on Darwin's head, Darwin crosses arms and is angry] I'm sorry, dude, I never meant to say your head was fat, your face looks great! A little scrunched up, though. You look so much better with a smile. C'mon. [Makes a happy face] C'mon. [Nudges Darwin] C'mon. C'mon. [lifts finger and tickles Darwin, while repeatedly saying c'mon]
Darwin: [Smiles, then giggles] Alright. [Inhales, then smiles]
Gumball: Ah, see? That's mu—
[Static; Darwin datamoshes, Gumball covers his mouth and gags]
Darwin: What?
Gumball: Uh... Nothing. Nothing. Uh, come on, let's just hug it out. [Reaches out for a hug]
Darwin: Okaaaaoaaaaau [Static, Darwin's pupils become real eyes]
Gumball: Aah! Oh! Oh, your face! Ugh! Ugh! Can you get up, I think I'm going to be sick!
Darwin: Could you be any more insulting? [Opens bathroom door] Gumball Watterson, I'm turning my back on y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y- [Static, then leaves]
Gumball: Dude, let me explain! There's... [Sighs] There's something weird going on here.
Apology Letter
Gumball: [Writing on paper] Dear Darwin... Nah. [Throws away paper and grabs a new one] Dearest Buddy... Hmm. [Throws away paper and pulls out a type writer] To my best compan... [Throws away type writer and pulls out a laptop] Dear Darwin, you are not only my brother, but my best friend. You are not ugly. Your face is fine. I feel utterly horrible for what happened today. I hope we don't stop being friends over this. [Tears form in Gumball's eyes] I hate to see you upset, because when you cry, I cry. May we never let this happen again. Your best buddy, Gumball... Nah. Not sure. [Prepares to throw computer]
Darwin: What's that?
Gumball: Oh! It's...umm...It's a letter. Uh...a letter I wrote for you.
Darwin: You gonna read it then?
Gumball: Nnnn...Okay. [Breathes in deeply] Dear Darwin, [Glitching] You are...butt...ugly...your face is...horrible...I hope we...stop being friends over this...see you...never...Gumball.
Darwin: I've done enough storming out for one day. I think it's your turn to leave.
Gumball: Look! Can I just... [Darwin slams the door onto Gumball's face] I'll...uh...take that as a no.
Richard: [Crying while holding the TV remote] I'm sorry old pal. We've had so many good times, but I can't bear to see you like this. It'd be cruel to go on any longer. [Turns off TV] Goodbye.
Gumball: What's wrong, Dad?
Richard: I just turned the TV off! [Hugs Gumball]
Gumball: Uh...Right. Can I speak to you?
Richard: [Jumps up in glee] Sure!
Gumball: You notice anything weird lately? Like, you know, strange things happening?
Richard: [Glitching] [In Spanish] ... Desconsuela, you need a doctor. It's her kidneys.. (Desconsuela, necesita un doctor. Son sus riñones)
Gumball: Wha?
Richard: [Glitching] ...on your new speed boat!
Gumball: Are you trying to be funny?
[Richard makes a laugh track sound]
Gumball: Okay...
[Darwin enters]
Darwin: [Sighs] Gumball, I've just realized there's no point me being angry upstairs by myself.
Gumball: Oh, w-w-well, great! So, you're..er [Laughs nervously] not mad anymore?
Darwin: No, I am. I'm just gonna do it somewhere you can see it. [Pulls angry face]
Gumball: Look, I think I know why you're so mad at me. Something weird is going on, ok? So just give me a chance to explain. [Inhales deeply] I [Glitching] thi-thi-thi-thithi-thi— [Sighs] I th-th— [Inhales deeply] you-a-wl-e-wl-e. Oh, come on!
Darwin: All right, just take your time and say what you need to say.
Gumball: What I wanted to say was, I thi-[Glitches]
