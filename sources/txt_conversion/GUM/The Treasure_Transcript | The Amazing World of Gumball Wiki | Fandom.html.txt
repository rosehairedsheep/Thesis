"How come we can't get this good stuff?"
[Scene starts at  the Wattersons' living room where Richard is sleeping on the sofa dreaming, while Gumball, Darwin, and Anais mess with him]
Richard: [Dreaming] AHH! It's the Internet's fault!
Gumball: [Whispers] Shh, shh! What did the Internet do, Dad?
Richard: I clicked the wrong link and it sent me to space! I can't breathe in space! And when I scream it makes no sound! Like this. [Richard screams with no sound; Darwin, Anais, and Gumball laughs]
[Nicole walks in]
Nicole: Stop laughing at your father and help me put away the groceries.
[In the kitchen, Darwin, Gumball and Anais look at the groceries; Gumball pulls out a box of cereal]
Gumball: Dude, I think there's something wrong with this cereal.
Darwin: Why?
Gumball: IT LOOKS DELICIOUS!
[Anais holds up a bagel]
Anais: This bagel is like three times the size of our burger buns. [Anais puts the bagel and the burger bites together] Wait a minute...
[Darwin grabs a carton of orange juice]
Darwin: And this orange juice has oranges in it, instead of letters and numbers!
Nicole: Ugh... I picked up someone else's groceries by mistake.
Anais: How come we can't get this good stuff all the time?
Nicole: Look, we'd be able to afford the good stuff if it wasn't fo- [Catches herself] rrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
[Camera changes to show Gumball, Darwin and Anais, still waiting for Nicole to finish; the camera changes back to Nicole, who is now looking around suspicously]
Nicole: ...rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
[Camera changes to show Gumball, Darwin and Anais still looking at Nicole; Camera changes back to Nicole but she has inexplicably disappeared]
Darwin: What was that all about?
[Gumball walks into the living room, Darwin and Anais follow him]
Gumball: You know that good stuff's got me thinking, what else is cheap in this house?
[Gumball, Darwin, and Anais walk into the living room]
Gumball: I mean, look at this MP3 player. Now tell me it's not a calculator with headphones stuck in it. [Grabs a copy of "How to Ratatwang Your Panda"] And that DVD is not even the real film. It's some mockbuster from the bargain bin.
Richard: What's wrong with "How to Ratatwang Your Panda"?
[On the TV Screen, a section of the film plays, taking place in a dojo]
Good CGI Mouse: Get ready, panda, use your secret weapon.
Chuck the Panda: Okay, you asked for it. [Does a massive fart in the other mice's face]
Bad CGI Mice: Oh, boy!
[Cuts back to the couch]
Richard: HAHAHAHAHA! HEHAHA! [Sighs] Clever.
[Gumball, Darwin, and Anais walk into the kitchen, and Gumball looks at the 'blender', which is just a fan, pointed downwards, taped to a bowl]
Gumball: And look at this blender. You're calling this top of the line?
[Gumball drops an orange onto it, and the orange splatters upwards around the room, completely missing the bowl]
Gumball: Why can't we have the good stuff?
Anais: More importantly, what's Mom hiding?
[The phone rings and Anais answers it]
Anais: Hello?
[Someone with a deep raspy voice answers her]
Stranger: For your own safety, stop digging around. There's nothing to find.
Anais: Okay, but if we were going to start digging, where should we look?
Stranger: Definitely not the attic. No, wait! Oh, darn it. [Hangs up]
Anais: [Chuckles evilly]
Digging in the Attic
[Scene changes to the kids up in the attic]
Darwin: So, where do we start?
Anais: Uh, how about that box?
Gumball: NO! NO!
[Anais picks up the box and keeps Gumball away, then Darwin opens the box, pulling out Gumball's baby pictures]
Darwin: [Gasps] Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude, you were an ugly baby.
[Anais and Darwin start laughing]
Gumball: I don't know what you're laughing at. [Gumball pulls out an ugly baby picture of Darwin; Darwin's reaction is the same as the picture]
Darwin: AHHH!! GIMME THAT! [repeating three times]
Gumball: NO!
Darwin: GIMME THAT! [He jumps on Gumball, moving a mirror, then it reflects onto several objects, then the brick wall. Gumball, Darwin, and Anais walk toward it]
Anais: Pass me that poker.
[Scene switches to living room; the poker banging in the attic and Richard's footsteps are in sync; Richard walks across the room while holding a large sandwich; Nicole takes it away]
Nicole: Sounds to me like you really don't need that sandwich. [Richard makes a sad face as he walks away]
[Scene switches back to the attic; Anais finally loosens a brick]
Anais: Okay, guys. This is how you solve a case.
[Anais removes the brick and the entire chimney collapses]
Gumball: [Sarcastically] Our chimney has been kidnapped! Detective Watterson, shall I cordon off the area for the forensic team?
Anais: Uggghh!
[Anais throws the brick down in aggravation; a plank comes up and hits her in the face, knocking her out]
Gumball: Anais! Anais! Anais! Look what we found under the floorboard.
Anais: [Her speech is slightly muffled due to large bruises and a swollen face] I'm still the one who found it. Oh, they're bank statements.
Gumball: [Not understanding Anais] No, they're bank statements.
Anais: Ugh.
Gumball Look. Back here we used to have loads of money. And then all went, in one big payment to Stellar Corporation.
Darwin: What did Mom spend all that money on?
Anais: Well, whatever it was, I bet this key has something to do with it.
Gumball: Wait, I've seen that key before! A long, long, time ago.
Digging in Gumball
[Scene changes to Gumball's bedroom; Gumball is sitting on the bed]
Darwin: [With hypnotizing eyes] Ready?
Gumball: Ok.
Darwin: [Quickly] One, two, three, sleep!
Gumball: [Falls onto the bed and snores]
Darwin: Now I'm going to take you back, all the way back to the last time you saw that key.
Gumball: I can see it. I'm in the attic. There's bank statements all over the floor.
Anais: That was just now!
Darwin: Go further back.
Gumball: Now I'm a baby...
[Camera changes to Gumball's flashback]
Gumball: [Voice-over] I'm with Mom. She's locking a suitcase.
Nicole: [Shows Gumball the key found in the attic] You must never tell anyone you saw this.
Gumball: [Gasp] It's the key!
[Camera changes back to the bedroom]
Anais: So whatever she bought was in that case...
Gumball: [Grunt] I'm going further back, to previous lives.
[Camera shows previous lives while Gumball describes them]
Gumball: I'm a school teacher, it's boring. I'm a pharmacist, totally boring. I'm a banker! That's really boring. Optician, boring, librarian, boring, prospector, boring, farmer, bor— Wait, wait, wait, prospector?
[The prospector in Gumball's flashback has a piece of gold in his hand and starts dancing after a good "Yeehaw!"]
Gumball: Hey that's pretty good, and I just found the gold ou— Wait a minute. I'm not the prospector. I'm the mule.
[Mule groans; camera changes to bedroom, Gumball is making the mule noise]
Darwin: Gumball, stop! Wake up!
Gumball: And now I'm a hypnotist. [Gumball wakes up, his voice and eyes change] Look into my eyes!
Darwin: [Hypnotized] Uhhhhhhhh...
[Anais looks at them disapprovingly, then notices a magnet on a string drop in through the window and steal the key]
Anais: [Gasps] Hey, HEY! STOP! [Anais grabs the magnet] Gumball, help!
Gumball: [To Darwin] Now you're allergic to cheese. Cheese! [Darwin sneezes]
Darwin: Now your body is now heavier than stone. [Gumball crashes through the floor]
[Anais detaches the key from the magnet, which winds back upwards out the window]
Anais: Hey! [Dives after the magnet] Come back here!
[Heavy footsteps are heard on the roof, followed by a thud on the ground]
Gumball: Now you can speak fluent French.
Darwin: Ce que peux-tu lu la pompe? Non, la "formation", gnimzah! (Translates to: What can you read the pump? No, the "training", gnimzah!)
[Anais splashes Darwin's bowl water to them]
Gumball and Darwin: Hey!
Anais: Someone just tried to steal the key, we need to get to that suitcase as quickly as possible!
Gumball: Can't we just go to bed?
[Anais splashes Darwin's bowl water on them again]
Gumball: Fine.
Another Clue
[Scene changes to Nicole and Richard's bedroom; they are both sleeping, then the door opens and a light shines onto Nicole]
Nicole: [Yawns] What's going on?
Gumball: [Standing near the door] I had a nightmare.
Nicole: Gumball, honey, you're too old to sleep in our bed.
[Gumball looks frustrated and starts flicking the lights on and off repeatedly]
Nicole: Alright, just get in.
[Nicole and Richard are on the bed sleeping while Gumball closes his eyes, preparing to retrieve the suitcase. He opens his eyes, checks if his parents are sleeping, then gets up on the bed. Richard then holds his head against his while he's sleeping. Gumball pushes it away but Richard's other arm grabs him again. He then pushes both of his hands away, but Richard puts his body over Gumball's, making him stuck. Eventually, Gumball manages to squeeze himself off the bed.]
Gumball: Uggh, that was like being born.
[Gumball then walks towards the cupboard, opens its bottom, and removes the suitcase. He then opens the suitcase using the key, and looks at the paper he removed from the suitcase in disapproval]
The Receipt
[Scene changes back to Gumball's, Darwin's and Anais's bedroom]
Anais: And that's all there was inside? An address and a bunch of doodles?
Gumball: Yeah. And, you know, the shovel.
Darwin: Wow, who would've thought Mom spent all that money on a rusty old shovel. Well, case closed! Bedtime!
Anais: Darwin, don't you see? This is another clue!
Darwin: [angrily] ARRGH! I'M SO TIRED OF ALL THESE CLUES!
Anais: Whatever she bought, she hid it somewhere at this address. It must be extremely precious! [Darwin sighs] Something BIG, like.. missile launch codes! Alien artifacts! A philosopher's stone! Or something even bigger!
Gumball: Oh, come on, Anais. If it was that big, Mom would've stopped us by now. The woman's virtually a ninja.
Anais: [Rubbing her chin] But that's just it! It isn't her that is trying to stop us. Those footsteps on the roof were way too heavy! [Rubbing her chin again] This goes much deeper than we thought, and the answer lies in this address. So what do you say? You're coming with me or not?
Gumball: Not. [Gumball turns off the lights, preparing him and Darwin to sleep]
The Reason to Poverty
[Scene changes to the Wattersons' front yard, where Anais is pulling Gumball and Darwin along with her]
Anais: Where is your sense of adventure? [Hears a whistling sound] Stop! Can you hear that?
[Camera shows the tires of Gumball's, Darwin's and Anais's bicycles being punctured]
Anais: [Mistaken it for a missile] IT'S GONNA BLOW! [Lays down defending herself]
Gumball: It's just our tires.
Anais: See? They're on to us! We proceed by foot! [Runs away]
[Gumball sighs, then he and Darwin follows Anais. Background then shows the headlights of a car lit up. Scene then changes to an open area on a rainy weather with a mailbox on the middle]
The Star Ending
Gumball: Is that it? An empty mailbox? All this was a wild goose chase, sending us to the middle of NOWHERE, AT THREE AM, IN THE POURING RAIN?! AND WHAT'S THIS STUPID SHOVEL FOR?!
Darwin: [Turns around looking angry with a deep voice] I'll show you what it's for. [Hits the mailbox with the shovel] THIS, IS FOR WASTING OUR TIME. AND THIS, IS FOR KEEPING ME UP ALL NIGHT. AND THIS, IS FOR THE RAIN. AND THIS, IS FOR NOT BREAKING HOWEVER MANY TIMES I HIT YOU.
Gumball: AND THIS... [Raising up the receipt, where a lightning struck to show the doodle behind the receipt. Anais then gasps] IS FOR GIVING US POINTLESS CLUES, LIKE THESE STUPID BUNCH OF DOODLES! [Tries to tear the receipt apart]
Anais: NO, WAIT! [Stops Gumball and looks at the doodles] That's no doodle, it's a map! Look! Here's the mailbox! [Points at the mailbox doodle in the map] That's the creepy windmill! [Points at the windmill far away] This must be the forest! [Points at the forest doodle in the map]
[Gumball and Darwin then looked at another direction in fear]
Gumball: [Frightened] Okay, we need to go now.
Anais: Hold on, I need to figure out where we are going.
Gumball: No, we need to go- [Turns Anais' head around] -right now.
[Camera shows a light flashing upwards. Gumball, Darwin, and Anais all scream. Scene then changes to a field of tall grass, where Gumball, Darwin, and Anais are running away]
Anais: They've found us! We need to get to the treasure before they get to us!
Gumball: [Repeatedly getting hit by the tall grass] I think it's my turn to go to the front, okay? [Runs into a tree] Aughhugh! ...Found the forest.
Anais: Great, we're looking for an old twisted tree in a clearing.
Darwin: AHH! [Points at a beam of light] They're still coming!
[Gumball, Darwin and Anais runs away to a huge log bridge. Anais runs across the bridge while Gumball and Darwin are afraid to cross it. The bridge starts budge]
Gumball: Are you sure about this? It looks kind of dangerous.
Anais: It's fine, just don't look down!
[Gumball and Darwin looks down and scream]
Gumball: WHY DID YOU MAKE US DO THAT?!
Anais: I didn't! I said DON'T look down.
[Gumball and Darwin looks down again and scream]
Gumball: YOU DID IT AGAIN!
Anais: Oh, come on. This thing has been here forever. [Bangs on the log bridge] It's totally sa-
[The log bridge starts to fall apart and Gumball and Darwin scream and run across the bridge. The bridge then falls apart]
Anais: JUMP!
[Gumball and Darwin jump. Darwin grabs Gumball's tail and Gumball grabs the edge of the cliff. Darwin then pulls Gumball's tail and Gumball's face sink inwards]
Anais: Take my hand!
Gumball: [Tries to reach for Anais] I can't see.
[Anais then grabs Gumball's face and pulls Gumball and Darwin up from the cliff]
Gumball: This treasure better be worth it.
Anais: Guys, look! [Points at twisted tree] There it is!
[Gumball, Darwin and Anais approaches the twisted tree. Darwin then digs a hole near the tree, and hits something hard]
Anais: That must be it!
[A stranger then turns on his flashlight at Gumball and Anais]
Stranger: Stop digging.
Gumball: ...Dad?
Stranger: No.
[The stranger then turns out to be Richard]
Richard: Yeah- [Turns off flashlight] -it's me.
Darwin Look! [Lifts up box] I got it!
Richard: No, please! Don't open the box! I'll give you anything you want!
Anais: We want whatever is in the box.
Richard: NOOOOO!
[Darwin slowly opens the box while Gumball, Anais and himself anticipate the moment to realize what is in the box, only to find another piece of paper inside]
Darwin: [angrily] OH MAN! IT'S ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPER!
Richard: It's not just a piece of paper. It's the reason we'll never be able to afford whatever we want.
Gumball: Would someone PLEASE tell me what's going on here!
Richard: [Sighs] It was twelve years ago. Gumball was just born. Your mother stayed at the hospital while the doctors tried to work out why he was so ugly. I was left at home, alone.
[Flashback]
Richard: [Narrating] It was the beginning of the internet.
Richard: [Using the computer] Click now for an out-of-this-world property investment for the future of your kids?! YES! [Clicks on the "YES" button in the computer]
Richard: [Narrating] I clicked too quick. I should've waited for the page to finish loading.
Richard: [Using the computer] Property investment for the future of your kids' great...great...great... [Gets worried as the page finishes loading] great...great...great...great...grandchildren's children?
[The scene now changes to Richard standing outside in the cornfields near the mailbox with his car as he lets out a depressed sigh]
Richard: [Narrating] I tried to get the money back, but the company had already gone bust. So in my shame, I buried the evidence.
[It cuts back to Richard in the present as he finishes his narration]
Anais: So it was you who hid the bank statements and tried to steal the key back!
Richard: [buries his head in the ground] Yes!
Gumball: Yeah, well, well, that was a very interesting story, Dad. Well done. BUT WHAT DID YOU BUY?!
