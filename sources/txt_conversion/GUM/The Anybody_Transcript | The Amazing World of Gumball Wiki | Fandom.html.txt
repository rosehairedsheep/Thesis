Clocks
[The episode begins with Gumball in bed at seven a.m. His alarm clock starts ringing, so he turns it off. Several other alarm clocks (and a rooster) start up too, so he deactivates all of them, ending up in the Robinsons' bed turning their alarm off]
Gaylord: [shouting angrily] What are you doing in my house?!
Gumball: [Talks fast] Oh thanks, Mr. Robinson, I knew I could rely on you to wake me up! [Gets out of bed and changes his clothes, which are inside the Robinsons' wardrobe, while still talking, leaving the wardrobe rocking dangerously] I can't be late for Miss Simian's class again, I've already been late once this week— well, three times if you count the other two times— [He pulls a tray holding a bowl of cereal and a carton of milk from under the Robinsons' bed] So I can't let her catch me again or she'll give me detention, there's no way she's going to catch me this time. I mean, it's not like I'm doing it on purpose, I'm just a heavy sleeper, you know? [Gumball gets his backpack from a cupboard] I mean, you wouldn't want to be woken up at seven a.m., would you? I mean, you would, because you're old. [Pushes the cupboard away from the window] What is it with old people and getting up this early? I guess you're just trying to drag out the last few days of life you've got left. [He hangs a rope ladder out the window] Anyways, have a nice day, bye!
[He climbs out of view from the room, leaving the Robinsons shocked. The wardrobe then falls over, crushing the bed and the Robinsons]
Running to School
[After Darwin enters the bus, the bus drives away from the Wattersons' house, leaving Gumball behind]
Gumball: Wait! [He falls off the rope ladder and chases after the bus] Wait! Wait! [He sees a person on a scooter] Hey! Stop, little boy! I need to borrow your-
[The person turns to face him, revealing himself to be Leonard Daniels]
Leonard Daniels: Yes?
Gumball: [Gasps] I need to borrow your wheels.
[The scene abruptly changes to Gumball running alongside the bus, hitting it using the scooter. Rocky, who is wearing headphones, cannot hear him properly]
Gumball: Let me in! Rocky, open the doors! Let me in! Rocky? Rocky?
[He begins repeating Rocky's name, but all Rocky can hear is the sound of the scooter hitting the bus, which he mistakes for the beat in the music he is listening to]
Rocky: Wow, it really does sound like trash!
[Outside the bus, Gumball runs into a bus stop. The scene then changes to Miss Simian counting down]
Lucy Simian: Three... two... one... and so begins my ten second countdown! Ten... nine—
Gumball: Wait!
Lucy Simian: Eight?
[Gumball runs into school, knocking Mr. Small back into his office, jumping on Principal Brown, knocking off his glasses in process, and finally running straight into Coach as she picks up the glasses just as the bell rings]
Lucy Simian [Whilst Gumball is running] Seven... six... five... four... three... two... one! You're late! Detention!
[Miss Simian performs a victory dance as she enters her classroom. Coach turns around, revealing Gumball stuck in her hair. She manages to push him out]
Clayton Stops Being Himself
[The scene changes to the entrance of Elmore Junior High as the home bell rings]
Lucy Simian: Home time, everyone! Except you, Watterson! I'll see you back here in five.
[Scene changes to Darwin splashing his face and drinking from a water fountain in the corridor. Gumball walks up to him]
Darwin: Oh hey! Too bad about the detention.
Gumball Nah, it's all right. I've got this annoying breathing technique that's going to make it as hard for her as it is for me.
[He pulls an odd face and breathes annoyingly]
Clayton: Cool story, Gumball!
Gumball: What the- Who said that?
[Clayton reveals that he was the water fountain]
Clayton: Me.
Gumball: Oh, Clayton, you're disguised as a water fountain?
Clayton: Yeah well, nothing interesting ever happens to me, so I thought I'd try becoming inanimate objects and, spoiler alert, nothing interesting ever happens to them, either.
[Flashback to "The Cage" where Gumball and Darwin watch Mr. Corneille "train." Clayton is disguised as a trophy at the shelf]
Voice: Try to relax, don't tire yourself out
Avoid any form of training.
[Flashback to "The Lady" where Samantha meets up with Violet, Maria and Angela at the mall fountain]
Maria: Samantha, finally. We've been waiting so long, Angela's clothes are back in fashion.
[Camera zooms in on Clayton, disguised as a aesthetic decor at the fountain, yawning]
[Flashback to the stadium. A football player kicks a ball same color as Clayton]
Gumball: Oh, that one's pretty interesting.
Clayton: Yeah, I wasn't the ball.
[Camera zooms in where Clayton is on the bench disguised as a helmet, bored. Flashback ends]
Clayton: See? It's boring. We're not all like you, Gumball. Running around, stopping the school from being blown up. Or wrestling an alligator.
Darwin: I don't think he's ever wrestled an a-
[Gumball shuts Darwin's mouth]
Gumball: Let the boy finish.
Clayton: I'm finished.
Gumball: Fair enough. Dude, you're wasting your talent. If nothing cool happens to you, why not just change into someone else? If I've learned one thing from movies, it's that the key to happiness is never be yourself.
Clayton: Okay, then I'll be Darwin.
[Clayton changes into Darwin]
Clayton as Darwin: So, what're we gonna do?
Darwin: I do not sound like that!
Clayton as Darwin: Try clearing your throat.
Darwin: Okay? [Clears throat and in new voice] Oh, yeah. That's better.
Gumball: Look, look, no offense, but he's kinda the sidekick. If you want real excitement, you gotta aim a little higher. Y-you know, someone a little more awesome? You know, someone who's a little bit- ME! You can be me!
Clayton as Darwin: Okay.
[Clayton changes into Gumball]
Gumball: Ah, that's more like it.
Lucy Simian: Watterson, get in here!
Clayton as Gumball: I know, I can sit your detention for you.
[Clayton rushes into Miss Simian's classroom]
Darwin: Well, aren't you gonna stop him? It's not right that he should be taking your punishment.
Gumball: [Talks drowsily] Oh Clayton, no. Please don't sit my detention for me. It would be a really bad idea. [Talks normally] I mean, he couldn't hear me. I tried, I tried hard.
[Darwin sighs and face slaps]
Darwin: Wait, if Clayton was the water fountain, then I must have been drinking-
Gumball: Come on, [Darwin turns pale and makes a horrified face] let's go before Simian catches the real me.
[Gumball pulls the horrified Darwin away]
Clayton the Bus Driver
[Gumball and Darwin are waiting for the bus. Rocky drives the bus in an unusually clumsy way. The bus stops and almost hits Gumball and Darwin]
Clayton as Rocky: Good morning, kids.
[Inside the school bus, Clayton is disguised as Rocky. He constantly makes sudden turns to avoid hitting oncoming vehicles]
Gumball: Ah! What the?
Clayton as Rocky: Hey guys, it's me.
Gumball: Yeah, and it's us. Just out of interest Rocky, how many of us can you see?
Clayton as Rocky: No it's me, Clayton. I'm doing like you said. Now I'm Rocky.
Darwin: Dude, you can't drive.
Clayton as Rocky: Oh, can't I-
[Scene abruptly changes to inside the mall, where the bus is seen crashed and upside-down. Firemen are on the scene, trying to put out the flames underneath the bus while sirens can be heard]
Darwin: Gumball, you started this, you have to stop it.
Gumball: But how do you stop somebody when they could be anybody? Any, any, any-
[Darwin slaps Gumball's hand]
Darwin: You just don't wanna do it, do you?
[A doctor suddenly walks on-screen, backing into Gumball]
Gumball: Huh? Who are you?
Doctor Man: I'm, I'm Doctor uhh, Doctor... Man. Uhh, here to do, [Checks Gumball with his stethoscope] doctoring things.
Gumball: [To Darwin] His stethoscope isn't even in his ears. He's clearly Clay-
Clayton as Rocky: Hey guys, it's me, Clayton. I'm sorry about the bad driving. But you gotta admit it was fun! [Makes double thumbs up gesture]
Nurse: Oh, Doctor Man! We've got a couple of patients we need you to attend to.
Doctor Man: Sure uhh, let me get my umm, uhh, bag?
Eddie: What a pro.
Nurse: He may be really shifty, but he's the best gosh darn surgeon I've ever met.
[Darwin sees another Doctor Man "look alike"]
Darwin: [Gasps] Clayton!
Doctor Man: Wait, what? [Wipes his eyes] This can't be happening my, my, twin brother. I- haven't seen you since last... Sunday.
Doctor Man's Twin Brother: Yes, here I am. In Elmore for, perfectly normal...
Doctor Man: ...Normal...
Doctor Man and Doctor Man's Twin Brother: Legitimate reasons.
Darwin: [Points] Wait! Clayton's over there!
[Clayton changes from Rocky into Larry behind a column. He runs through the exit, completely bypassing Karen]
Darwin: We need to stop him!
Gumball: It'll certainly be easier than figuring out whatever... this is.
[Doctor Man and his twin brother shake hands. Gumball and Darwin run away]
Disguise Craze
[Scene cuts to outside the mall in the parking lot. The real Larry is describing Clayton to Doughnut Sheriff as Gumball and Darwin run past]
Larry: And then he just rode away on it, bold as brass!
Donut Sheriff: Tell me again what he looked like?
Larry: He's about yea tall with a hat, a green shirt, and an orange tie.
[Doughnut Sheriff looks down at his sketch. He has drawn a picture of Larry]
Donut Sheriff: Okay buddy, [Starts to open the hatch to let the dogs out] I'm gonna give you a ten-second head start.
[Larry, now spooked, slowly backs off and runs away. The scene changes to Gumball and Darwin running down a street in town, chasing after Clayton, who has morphed into Mrs. Jötunheim and is recklessly swooping about on a broomstick]
Clayton as Mrs. Jötunheim: Whoo! This is so much fun!
[The real Mrs. Jötunheim comes out of a building and notices her broomstick is missing]
Mrs. Jötunheim: Huh? Ah, cauldrons! And I was two payments away from owning that broom! At least I didn't fill it up with gas.
[High up in the air, the broomstick sputters to a halt. Clayton falls off it and plummets towards the ground]
Gumball: Quick, Clayton! Turn into a bird!
Clayton: Okay!
[He turns into Colin and continues to fall]
Gumball: No, not a nerd, a bird! You know, like an eagle!
Clayton as Colin: Got it!
[He turns into a beagle and continues to fall]
Gumball: No, not a beagle—
Gumball and Darwin: A BIRD!
Clayton: Oh, a bird! [He turns into a penguin] How is this gonna he—
[He splats onto the road, forming a zebra crossing]
Gumball: [Shocked] Well, at least he made it safe for us to cross the road!
Clayton: [Turns back into his normal form] Ha ha! That was awesome! This was such a good idea! Wahoo!
[He bounces away]
Gumball: No, please sto-
[The broom lands on his head, knocking him out]
Catching Clayton
[The scene changes to Tobias trying to get into his house]
Tobias: [Knocking on the door] Let me in! Let me in! [He sees Gumball and Darwin run past] Hey guys! I've locked myself out!
Gumball: We don't have time, man!
Tobias​​​​​​​: No, I mean I've been locked out by myself!
Gumball: Right, you've been locked out and you're on your own.
Darwin: We still don't have time!
Tobias​​​​​​​: No, I mean I HAVE BEEN LOCKED OUT OF MY HOUSE BY AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS EXACTLY THE SAME PHYSICAL APPEARANCE AS I DO!
Darwin: Ohh.
Gumball: Why didn't you say so?
[The scene changes to a window looking into the Wilsons' house. Gumball, Darwin, and Tobias look through it and see the Wilsons celebrating Tobias' birthday]
Jackie​​​​​​: Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you...
[Harold places a cake on the table in front of Tobias. Jackie's voice fades into the background]
Tobias​​​​​​​: But it's my birthday, my cake, and they're my candles! Okay, I promise never to be selfish again! Please spare it! Show me no more!
[He sobs beneath the windowsill. Gumball pats him on the shoulder]
Darwin: Clayton's gone!
[Harold, listening to music, runs out of the back door]
Darwin: [Points at him] There!
[Harold runs up to the ticket booth at the cinema]
Clayton as Harold​​​​​: One child's ticket, please!
Flight Attendant: [Disapproving] Really, sir?
[Clayton morphs into Kayvon]
Clayton as Kayvon: I mean, one child's ticket, please!
Flight Attendant: Uhh...
[Clayton morphs into Donald]
Clayton as Donald: Unless senior tickets are cheaper!
Flight Attendant: [Shocked] Just go right on in.
[Just after Clayton enters the theater, Gumball and Darwin run up to the booth]
Gumball: Excuse me, did you see a guy—
Darwin: Or a woman—
Gumball: Old—
Darwin: Or young—
Gumball: Tall—
Darwin: Or short?
Flight Attendant: They all went in there. [Points to theater]
Gumball: Okay, this'll be easy. [Opens theater doors] The theater will be empty at this time o—
[The theater is packed full of people]
Darwin: Let's split up.
[Darwin descends the left set of stairs, Gumball the right]
Darwin: [Pointing at Alison] The cat's out the bag!
Alison: [Checks paper bag she is holding] Oh my goodness, you're right! [She gets out of her seat] Martin! Martin, where are you?
Gumball: [Pops up behind Principal Brown's chair] I know who you really are!
Nigel Brown: [Says "Oh, please don't tell the school board!" in Vietnamese.]
Darwin: [Points at Betty] I smell a rat!
Frankie: Sorry, kid, that was me.
Gumball: [Approaches Ocho] Game over!
[Ocho disappears with a classic "game over" sound]
Darwin: [Jumps over to Alan] Busted!
[Darwin pops Alan accidentally. He walks over to Gumball, who is checking a chair]
Darwin: It's no good. We've asked everybody!
Clayton as Gumball: [Severely muffled by the chair] Darwin! Darwin!
Darwin: And this is no time for ventriloquism!
[Suddenly, "Gumball" pops out of the closed chair, spitting a piece of popcorn out of his mouth]
Clayton as Gumball: Typical. Salted.
Darwin: Gumball? [Shouting] Then that's Clayton!
[Several citizens in the theater shush Darwin]
Darwin: Sorry. [Whispering] Then that's Clayton.
Alligator Fight
[Clayton, still morphed into Gumball, runs out of the theater, and is pursued by Gumball and Darwin. He runs until he falls down an open manhole. Darwin stops just before the manhole]
Darwin: That was clo- [Gets cut off by Gumball bumping into him, making him fall down the manhole]
Clayton as Gumball: Okay, well, as you're already down there you can kinda sorta-
[Darwin grabs him by the leg, pulling him down the manhole too. Inside the sewer, Clayton (still as Gumball) slides down a stream of water, with Gumball and Darwin not far behind]
Clayton as Gumball: Clayton, stop! I'm sorry, I shouldn't have told you to be someone else! I was wrong!
Gumball: But other people's lives are so much more exciting! Especially yours!
Clayton as Gumball: Yes, that is true, but you've gotta be yourself. Live your own life.
Gumball: Why, thanks Gumball! Only you could've stopped this terrible situation!
Clayton as Gumball: Nah, it's just what we do. We run around for a while and then we save the day.
Darwin: There's usually a bit more to it than that!
Clayton as Gumball: You're right! Sometimes we sing! [Singing] I believe-
Gumball: Yeah, I think we're all good for the song, thanks! And we're done, yeah?
Clayton as Gumball: Yeah, I guess so.
Gumball: Cool, but- [Screams and wails as he falls into a pool at the bottom of the sewer]
Darwin: Aah! What are we gonna do?
Clayton as Gumball: Quick, grab those ropes!
[Gumball and Darwin grab the "ropes," only to find they are actually the tails of rats. The rats hiss at them, and the two scream and throw them away]
Clayton as Gumball: Now what?
Darwin: Don't worry. I've got this.
[Darwin turns around and grabs Gumball, stopping in the water flume just before the pool. After struggling against the flowing waters and Gumball's weight, Darwin swims up the flume to the edge of the pipe. He gets up, feeling exhausted, and his tail deflates]
Darwin: Oh. [Gasps] Clayton. [Drops Gumball] Clayton, are you alright?
Clayton: [Gets up from the spot Darwin dropped Gumball] Yeah, I'm fine, thanks. What about Gumball?
Gumball: [Rises from the pool below them, struggles to swim] Help! Ah, help!
Clayton: Ah, yeah, sorry. I made a deal with Gumball in the movie theater. He let me do all the running around, saving the day bit, as long as I promised to be myself from now on.
Gumball: Clayton! Stop being yourself and turn into something useful!
Clayton: Uh-uh, I'm staying true to myself from now on, as per your advice.
[Gumball continues flailing in the water, until an alligator swims by. Gumball grabs onto the alligator]
Gumball: Never mind, it's alright, I've found an alligator to hold onto.
[Gumball realizes he said "alligator," lets go of it, and continues screaming as the alligator turns around]
Gumball: HELP!
[Gumball swims toward a pipe as the alligator swims towards him. It tries to snap at him, but Gumball is too high up the pipe for it to reach him]
Clayton: I thought you'd fought an alligator before!
Gumball: Yeah, look, maybe if you'd tire him out a little bit- [Stops talking as the alligator snaps at him again]
Darwin: Just tell him the truth!
[The pipe Gumball is holding on to suddenly breaks]
Gumball: Okay, okay, I've never fought an alligator! [Alligator snaps at him again] Now come on, help me!
Clayton: Stand back. [Jumps from the pipe and into the water. He then comes to the surface morphed into Donald again]
Gumball: Why would you turn into a senior citizen?
Clayton as Donald: I thought bringing wisdom and experience to the situation might help. [Morphs back into his original form, regains his regular voice] No?
[The alligator rises underneath Clayton, before biting and dragging him under. Clayton then wrestles the alligator, rising to the surface several times before disappearing into the water. As the pipe tilts downward, Gumball whimpers as the alligator leans closer to him. As it opens its mouth to bite him, it stops]
Clayton as Alligator: This makes me cooler than you, right?
Gumball: [Shaking, looking very traumatized] W-what?
Clayton as Alligator: [Voice starts as the alligator's, before shifting into Clayton's own] Because I really did fight an alligator! [Looks at Gumball shaking] Hey Darwin, is he gonna be okay?
Darwin: He'll be fine, he's just had too much excitement for one day.
Clayton as Alligator: [Regular voice] I think I know what to do.
[Cut to the football stadium, where a ball resembling Clayton is set on the field. A player kicks it out of the way, revealing Gumball, Darwin, and Clayton sitting on a bench. Darwin and Clayton are eating chips, while Gumball is still whimpering and clinging to a piece of the pipe]
Darwin: I don't think this is working.
Clayton: Yeah, well not everyone can handle the excitement of hanging out with me.
[Clayton tosses a chip in the air to eat it, but it bounces off his forehead instead. Clayton looks up in confusion, and the episode ends]
