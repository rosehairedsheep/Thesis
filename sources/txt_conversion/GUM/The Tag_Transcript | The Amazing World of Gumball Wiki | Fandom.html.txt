The Trash Can Feud
[The episode starts with Richard, in his bathrobe, trying to stuff a trash bag into the overflowing bin. He tries to push it down with a stick, but it hits him in the face, landing in his mouth. He tastes it and gags. He then ties his robe belt around his forehead and punches the trash down, but that only sends up a cloud of stink. Then, he roundhouse kicks the bin but only falls over, followed by his house shoe falling on his face. After that, he climbs to the top of the lamppost.]
Richard: SUPER SLAM FLYING ATTACK!!
[He slams onto the trash, but the bags reinflate under him and overturn the bin with him inside. After this attempt, he gives up.]
Richard: Ugh! 
[Then, he sees the Robinsons' empty trash bin and gets an idea. He glances around, and drops his trash into their bin.]
Gaylord: [Pops out] This is a senior citizen's arrest!
Richard: What? Why?
Gaylord: For littering.
Richard: It's not littering if I'm putting trash in a trash can.
Gaylord: It is if it's my trash can. I knew you'd been stuffing your trash in here. It took me a week, but I caught you red-handed.
Richard: Wait, you've been hiding there for a week?
Gaylord: What I do with my retirement is my own business. Now leave this trash can alone. I own it!
Richard: But it's empty. You don't own the air inside it.
Gaylord: Yes I do!
Richard: You can't own nothing!
Gaylord: But I own the lid to nothing, and it stays shut! [Slams trash can shut] Hmph!
Richard: Oh, think puffing out your chest is going to intimidate me? [Inhales sharply, then his belly pops out]
Gaylord: [Laughs]
Richard: Don't laugh! [Pokes Mr. Robinson's belly]
Gaylord: Don't poke me!
Richard: I will poke you whenever I like!
[Both Richard and Mr. Robinson push their fists together, electricity can be seen. Mr. Robinson loses out, and gets punched in the nose]
Gaylord: Ahh! [Jumps Richard, and they fight offscreen; their clothes fly into the air]
House Arrest
[The scene cuts to the Watterson living room, where the Wattersons are.]
Richard: And the police said I have to wear this thing for...
[Changes to Mr. Robinson's house]
Gaylord: Six weeks. And I can't leave the house or it...
[Back to Wattersons' house]
Richard: Sets off an alarm and I'll be...
[Back to Robinson's house]
Gaylord: Sent to prison. And it was all...
Richard and Gaylord: HIS FAULT!
Gumball: Dad, could you explain that again, this time using full sentences?
Richard: I'd love to, but I'm too busy...
Gaylord: [off scene] Plotting my revenge!
[All the Wattersons hear Mr. Robinson shouting]
Darwin: Hmm... I see what's happening here.
Richard: Boys, I need you to sneak into Mr. Robinson's house. There's this old prank I used to do in college.
Gumball: [quizzically] College?
Richard: Okay, high school. Just do as I say.
The Feud Begins
[The scene cuts to Mrs. Robinson carrying groceries into her home. Once inside, she puts the groceries on a dresser. She then leaves.]                       
[Suddenly, Gumball and Darwin are heard talking, but aren't seen. They are presumably in the grocery bag.]
Gumball: [whispering] Dude, is she gone?
Darwin: [whispering] Yeah, I think it's safe.
[Then, it turns out that the boys aren't in the bags, but in a black and white picture just next to it. The boys are also in black and white]                       
Gumball: Okay, let's do this.
[The boys jump out of the painting, turning back into their normal colors.]                      
Gumball: Right. Now we just need to find the butter. [takes one of the bags and goes through it] [stops whispering] Dude, what is it with old people and canned stuff? I mean look, [pulls out canned foods] canned pizza, canned yogurt, canned water?!
Darwin: Shh! Just find the canned butter and get on with it!
Gumball: [finds the canned butter in the bag and opens it] You know what? Now that we're here I don't think we're doing the right thing.
Darwin: Well, we can't disobey Mr. Dad. He told us to put butter on everything in the house.
Gumball: Hmmm... look, let's compromise. We'll just pick one thing and butter that.
Buttered Floors
[The scene cuts to Mr. Robinson walking into his living room.]
Gaylord: Margaret? We're out of canned toothpaste. AAH!
[Suddenly, Mr. Robinson slips on the floor and slowly slides into the fireplace, a coat hanger, the sofa, and the wall, knocking over some objects in the process. Outside, Gumball and Darwin are watching Mr. Robinson from a window.]
Gumball: On second thought, maybe we shouldn't have chosen the floor.
Darwin: I feel so guilty. We've reduced a beautiful vintage gentleman, to a greased up, slidy sausage!
Gumball: We have to make up for this. Let's tell Mr. Robinson we'll help him settle the score with Dad.
I Might Forgive You
[Then, Gumball and Darwin are seen on their hands and knees, crying in front of Mr. Robinson.]
Gumball: [crying] ...And we only did it because we didn't want to lose the unconditional love of our father!
Gaylord: Under ordinary circumstances, I'd be so furious with you my kidneys would fail. But I think I'll forgive you.
[Gumball and Darwin look dried up.]
Gumball: [in a dry voice] Good. Because I've cried so much, all the moisture is gone from my body.
Gaylord: But, I hadn't finished. I'll forgive you if you do something for me first!
The Bathtub Filled with Cheese
[Richard is getting into his bathtub.]
Richard: [takes off robe and gets in the bathtub. Melted cheese seeps out of the bathtub] Wait... this isn't water! [sticks a finger in the cheese and tastes it] I'm in a bath of melted cheese! [quietly] I've been wishing for this for twenty years. [opens a secret compartment in the wall, containing a bag of "Nacho Crisps." He dips one in the bath and eats it.]
[Downstairs, Gumball and Darwin are sitting on the couch.]
Gumball: I feel so guilty, we betrayed our own father!
[Then, Richard hums while walking down the stairs and into the kitchen.]
Darwin: Uh, I don't know man, he still looks pretty happy.
Richard: [off-scene] What?! Nooooo!
Gumball: Ah... there it is!
Richard: Robinson stole all my cheese! [to himself] He must have done it while I was in that magic bath.... [out loud] But how did he trick the tag?
Trying to Trick a Tag
[In the next scene, Gumball, Darwin, and Richard are next to their front door.]
Richard: Okay boys, here's the plan. Hold my foot.
[Then, Richard is seen crawling across the ground, looking stretched out.]
Richard: You put your dirty hands on my cheese, you get my greasy fingers on your windshield!
[It is seen that Gumball and Darwin are holding Richard's foot, preventing the ankle bracelet from going off.]
Gumball: Ughhh... I'm losing my grip!
Darwin: His cankle is too wide for my hands!
[Richard is still crawling on the ground, in front of him are small shovels, which he uses to help him crawl.]
Darwin: Grab his pants!
[Gumball and Darwin grab Richard's pants, but end up letting go of them. Richard's pants go flying off, and he slams into Mr. Robinson's car, making the car alarm go off and setting off Richard's ankle tracker.]
What Don't You Understand?
[Scene changes to Gumball, Darwin, Richard, and the Donut Cop in the Wattersons' house.]
Donut Sheriff: What part of under house arrest don't you understand?
Richard: Hmmm... I guess the word under. Because technically you're inside the house.
Donut Sheriff: If you leave your house again, we'll find you in fifteen minutes and put you in prison! Keep an eye on your father, kids.
Gumball: Don't worry, officer. The whole thing was just a silly feud.
Darwin: Now things are even, there's no reason Mr. Robinson would seek revenge!
[In Mr. Robinson's house, Mr. Robinson walks by a window and notices that there is a huge dent in his car in the shape of Richard's head.]
Gaylord: My Caaaaaaaaaaaar!
Bee on a Stick
[In the next scene Mr. Robinson is pushing what appears to be a long stick out the window. Gumball and Darwin are with him.]
Gaylord: Ehh.. almost.
Gumball: Mr. Robinson, we need you to stop this feud or you and Dad are gonna end up in prison.
Gaylord: Almost there... darn it! [pulls back in the long stick, which is made up of household items that have a long reach]
Darwin: What are you doing, anyway?
Gaylord: Trying to get back at your father, but this thing's still not long enough!
[On the end of the stick, there is a bee taped down to a pencil.]
Gumball: What the wasp?! Mr. Robinson! This argument has spiraled into madness! It has to stop.
Gaylord: Not till your father pays for what he did to my car.
Gumball: Then you leave us no choice, sir. Darwin?
[Darwin gets Mr. Robinson's alarm clock.]
Darwin: Stop the feud, or I reset your alarm clock.
Gaylord: No! I won't know how to reprogram it!
Gumball: Then end it!
Gaylord: Never!
Darwin: How would you like to wake up at six? Seven? Eight? Or nine a.m.?
Gaylord: Nine a.m.?! I'll lose half the day!
Gumball: You know, this can end anytime you like.
Gaylord: Humph. Do your worst. My bladder will wake me up at five anyway.
Gumball: Well then, how would you like your radio tuned to young people's music?!
[Darwin turns the radio to a "young people's music" station, and a parody of the song "Baby" plays.]
Gaylord: AGH! HE SAID THE WORD "BABY" OVER SEVENTEEN TIMES! TURN IT OFF!
[Darwin turns the radio off.]
Gaylord: Okay! Okay! I give up! I'll end the feud. But please, can you do this one thing for me in return? [pulls out an envelope] I can't leave the house to post this letter. Would you do it for me?
Gumball: Sir, it would be an honor.
Why Can't We Bee Friends?
[Scene changes back to the Wattersons' house.]
Richard: [Reading the letter] Stick your head out of the front window for a special surprise. Hmm, all evidence points to this letter being a trap, but what if it's a nice surprise, like a cake or a kiss?
[Richard opens up the window and looks out, and gets stung by the bee attached to Mr. Robinson's stick.]
Richard: AAH! It was a trap! Unless this bee tastes of honey. [Sticks his tongue out] AAH! It doesn't! It tastes of pain!
Darwin: Oh, man. I knew we should have checked the address.
Gaylord: [Laughing] Let's "bee" friends, Watterson.
Richard: [Growls and shoves the stick back up to Mr. Robinson] I hope you like "eyes" cream!
Gaylord: That pun doesn't even make sense!
[Both Richard and Mr. Robinson continue fighting]
Darwin: This is never going to stop, is it?
[Richard manages to hit Mr Robinson hard enough for him to fall. He laughs at Mr. Robinson, but the window pane slides down and knocks him out.]
Gumball: I think we need to do something drastic.
Ending the Feud Where It All Started
[Next scene is Richard and Mr. Robinson inside the garbage can while sleeping. Richard kisses him and they both wake up screaming.]
Richard: Where are we?
Gaylord: Smells like a dumpster.
[Richard tries opening the dumpster.]
Richard: It's locked.
[A video camera appears in front of them.]
Gaylord: Hmm, play me? What kind of a musical instrument is this? [blows on it]
Richard: It's a video camera!
[Richard plays the camera. Gumball appears on it.]
Gumball: [on the camera] Good evening, gentlemen. This feud started with a trash can and that's where it's going to end. In front of you is a cake.
Richard: Mmm. [eats the cake whole]
Gumball: Inside the cake is a key. By sharing the cake, you'll find the key. And learn that sharing is the key... to getting out of there.
[Richard gulps and Mr. Robinson looks at him angrily.]
Gumball: You have fifteen minutes before the police arrive!
Richard: I'm pretty sure it'll be more than fifteen minutes before we see that key again.
Gaylord: YOU JELLY BELLY FOOL! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?! IF YOU DIDN'T SNAG THAT CAKE WE WOULD'VE BEEN OUT OF HERE BY NOW!
Richard: If you shared that trash can, we would've been in here in the first place!
Darwin: Don't you think they should've figured it out by now?
Gumball: I'll go and check. [sees the trash can rolling down hill.] [sighs] Aw man.
[Gumball and Darwin start running down hill.]
Darwin: That was the worst idea you've ever had!
Gumball: Oh, come on, it was pretty good. The mysterious riddle, the positive message, the fact they got to eat a cake.
[Mr. Small on his roller blades tries not to lose his balance.]
Gumball: Mr. Small, watch out!
Mister Small​​​​​​: Don't worry. I'll use my rollerblading skills to avoid it.
[Mr. Small jumps in slow motion but the trash can hits him, causing his skates to be left on the ground.]
Darwin: [panting] We're never gonna catch them!
Gumball: I've got an idea. But it's really uncool.
[Gumball is seen riding Darwin (on roller blades) while slapping him to go faster.]
Gumball: Come on! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster!
Darwin: Why are you always trying to motivate me with cruelty, when you know I respond better to emotional rewards?!
Gumball: Sorry man. [pats him]
Darwin: Ah, that's better. AHHHHH! [catches up with the trash can]
Gumball: Ok! Don't move! Okay, I got this.
[Gumball jumps too far and over the trash can causing him and Darwin to crash into each other.]
Darwin: [catches up again] AHHHH!
Gumball: Okay, maybe a little closer this time. [Successfully jumps on top of the trash can] Haha! What do we do now?!
Darwin: I don't know! Jam the wheel or something!
[Both look around for something. They see Marvin and steal his cane.]
Marvin: No, please! I'm too old! I can't walk without my cane-[starts crying] [sees Hexagon Lady walking and walks normal] Oh, hello.
Gumball and Darwin: Woohoo!
Gumball: [looks ahead of him.] Ahhh! Hold on guys, I'm going to get you out of there! [starts jamming the wheel with the cane but nothing's happening. Gumballs looks ahead and tries again.] Ahh! [He tries one more time and breaks the wheel off but still goes downhill.] Ahhh!
Darwin: There's nothing we could do anymore! They're going to have to jump!
Gumball: Catch me, Darwin! [jumps off trash can]
[The trash can goes downhill and crashes into a car, landing on the road. Gumball and Darwin also roll down hill while watching the trash can crash on the road]
Darwin: Uhh, I'm sure they're still okay.
[Various cars crash into the garbage bin and the Hector steps on it, a lightning bolt strikes it, and a satellite crashes on it.]
Gumball and Darwin: NOOO! [They both cry on their knees but notice the nacho cheese wrappers]
Gumball: Oh wait, these are all dad's nacho cheese wrappers. This is our trash can! We've been chasing the wrong one.
Darwin: Which means they're still in Mr. Robinson's trash can at home.
Gumball: There's still time to get them back in the house before the cops come.
Darwin: [Gumball starts riding on him again and pets him.] AHHH!
[Scene changes to Mr. Robinson's trash can]
Gaylord: I agree, wearing a tie every day despite neither of us having a job is perfectly appropriate.
Richard: It gives you a sense of purpose when you have absolutely nothing to do.
Gaylord: You know, Watterson, maybe you and I aren't so different after all.
Richard: And all it took was my children locking us in a dumpster to realize it. We should've just done this in the first place. [They both shake hands. The trash can lid opens up.] Ahh, boys finally.
[The Donut Cop appears.]
Donut Sheriff: The worst part about this job is you give people a second chance and you still end up having to taze them.
Richard: Wait! That was all his fault!
Gaylord: Don't listen to him, officer! He's nothing but a good for nothing—
[The Donut Cop tazes them. Episode ends.]
