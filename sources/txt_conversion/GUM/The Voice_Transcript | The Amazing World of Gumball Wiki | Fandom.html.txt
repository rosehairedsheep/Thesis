An Anonymous Message
[Episode opens with Gumball and Darwin in their room, on their computer]
Gumball: [In a high pitched voice while typing] And if you really didn't know that, then maybe you should read a book.
Darwin: [Reading book] I don't know, dude. This book says he's right. Apparently, nachos aren't fruit.
Gumball: What the what?! You mean that we've been in that flame war for seven hours, and we can't even win?! [Sighs]
Darwin: Did he make any spelling mistakes?
Gumball: No, but he did say "who" instead of "whom."
Darwin: Call it.
Gumball: [Typing] I think you'll find it's whom.
Gumball and Darwin: Hehehehe.
Gumball: [Makes slapping motion] Whap, whap! Cyberpsyche!
Darwin: Quick, block him before he can respond.
[Gumball blocks the Egghead]
Gumball: Hahaha. I love Elmore Plus. It's like real life, but with none of the consequences.
Darwin: Yeah, you get to see what everyone does, and how happy they are, and how much better their lives are compared to ours.
[Gumball and Darwin are surprised]
Darwin: Let's write more sarcastic comments.
Gumball: [Reading Leslie's comment on his pictures of his roots being cleaned] "Just got my roots done, what do you think?" [Typing] I think you should realize this is a public forum, and put your pot back on.
[Gumball submits this, and he along with Darwin snicker. Leslie then responds to their comment]
Darwin: [Reading the comment] "Upset because of a certain someone. They know who they are."
Gumball: [typing] Stop posting mysterious status updates when we have no idea who you're talking about.
[Alan thumbs up all the comments on the page]
Gumball: Huh, I don't get this. There's always people who gives a thumbs up to everything like "Tobias is getting his appendix out today. Prob gonna have a scar." [Does a derpy thumbs up gesture] Thumbs up from Alan! What is he liking about that exactly? The fact that it wasn't him who is in pain?
Darwin: Let me handle this. [Typing] You have reached your thumb up limit. Please walk away from your computer, look at yourself in the mirror, and give yourself a thumb down.
[Alan thumbs up that]
Gumball: Let's just block him. In fact, let's block everyone who annoys us. Block, block, block, block, block, block, block, block, block, block, block, block, block. Done.
[They block everyone. A message comes in from someone]
Darwin: We got a message.
Gumball: Who from?
Darwin: I don't know. It's blocked. [In a dark voice] Dear Gumball and Darwin…
Gumball: What's with the voice?
Darwin: [In normal voice] It says "Read in a deep, scary voice," at the top. [Resumes dark voice] You have wronged me for the last time. By the end of the day, I will have my revenge, and you will be sorry for the way you treated me. Signed, your sworn enemu. [Another message comes in] Sorry, typo. I meant enemy.
Gumball and Darwin: [Gasp] Ahh!
Apologies to Everyone
[Gumball and Darwin are eating lunch in the cafeteria. The point of view is that of the anonymous poster]
Gumball: What do we do, and who sent the message?! It could be anyone!
Darwin: It couldn't just be anyone. It has to be someone we've upset.
[Gumball and Darwin think for a while]
Darwin: Yeah, you're right. It could be anyone.
[The anonymous poster suddenly hides behind a pillar]
Gumball: Oh, I know. Let's apologize to everyone.
[The figure comes back into view]
Darwin: Yes, that's the only way we can be sure.
[They walk away]
Mysterious Figure: How could you forget what you've done to me?
[Flashback to Gumball and Darwin looking at the mysterious figure, disgusted. The POV is still that of the mysterious figure]
Mysterious Figure: Hey, guys, I just wanted to say that you seem really cool, and, well, I think we should hang out. What do you... say?
Gumball: …Wow, that was awkward. Ok, so, um. We're gonna go now. But, you... uh, you should stay here. Ok, bye.
[Gumball and Darwin slowly back up to a trash can and then run away. Flashback ends, and the milk carton starts to shake]
Mysterious Figure: Your time will come.
[Milk carton explodes and the students turn around to look at the mysterious figure]
Darwin: [Talking to Sussie] C'mon, there must be something we've done to you that is worth an apology. Think!
Gumball: Yes, come on. Use your pointy brain.
Sussie: But Sussie's not angry. Sussie likes you. Sussie likes all the things in the world.
Gumball: Yeah. Well, I gotta apologize for something. So I'll apologize for this.
[Gumball starts drumming on Sussie's head, and he smacks one of her eyes off of her. They all gasp]
Gumball: Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.
[Darwin places Sussie's eye back on her body]
Sussie: [Laughs] But Sussie liked that too!
[Gumball and Darwin hug Sussie]
Gumball and Darwin: Aww.
[Gumball and Darwin stop hugging Sussie]
Gumball: Okay, next!
[Gumball and Darwin walk away. Sussie then drums on her own head while humming a tune]
Give Us a Hug
[Cut to the outside of the boys' bathroom. Camera slowly zooms into the door]
Tobias​​​​​: [Off-screen] Darn right, I'm angry at you!
[Cut to inside of the boys' bathroom]
Gumball: [Whispering] Tell us about it.
Tobias​​​​​: Have you ever noticed that nothing in this world is set up as it should be!?
Darwin: Like what?
Tobias​​​​​: I should be more important! I should be the one with the sidekick, and exciting adventures. I'm more handsome, richer, AND more colorful than you guys. And YET, it's like I'm the supporting character of my own life!
Gumball: [Scoffs] Come on.
Tobias​​​​​: I'm not hugging you, we're both in towels.
Darwin: [Whispering] Come on.
[Gumball and Darwin slowly walk closer to Tobias]
Tobias​​​​​: No... no no.
[Cut to the hallway]
Tobias​​​​​: [Still in the bathroom] Get off, get off, get off, get off, get off!
[Gumball, Darwin and Tobias crash out of the bathroom door. They roll to the middle of the hallway. Everyone stares at them]
Gumball: Give me a hug!
Tobias​​​​​: [Pushes Gumball and Darwin off of him] Leave me alone, you weirdos!
Darwin: You leave us no choice. [Grabs Tobias' towel, then starts whipping him with it] Accept our apology! Accept it! Forgive us! Look how sorry we are! Give us a hug!
Tobias​​​​​: Okay! Ugh, jeez. [Grabs his towel and replaces it, then hugs Gumball and Darwin before reentering the bathroom]
[The perspective switches to the mysterious poster's point of view]
Gumball: Right! That's one less angry friend to deal with.
Darwin: Who's next?
Gumball: Uhh... [Looks around] Leslie! Hey buddy, we apologize for-
Leslie​​​​​: [Terrified] It's okay! I forgive you, alright? [Flees while giving a strange look at the anonymous figure watching Gumball and Darwin]
[Gumball and Darwin shrug. The bell rings and the students vacate the hallway, except for the unknown poster]
Mysterious Figure: Your time to apologize has passed. Expect nothing but my wrath now!
[The lockers in the hallway shake, and start blasting open. A fire extinguisher is set loose and bounces around the hallway, and hits the figure's face]
Mysterious Figure: Ouch.
Apologies to Everyone Else
[In the schoolyard, Gumball and Darwina reconfronting Alan]
Alan​​​​​​: No no no, guys. I apologize for making you feel like you owed me an apology.
Gumball: Dude, this has been going on for an hour now. Just accept our apology, and let's be done with it!
Alan​​​​​​: I apologize for apologizing so much.
[Gumball and Darwin are frustrated, the former face palming]
Darwin: Stop apologizing for one second there-
Alan​​​​​​: Sorry!
Gumball: [Mutters something] I think it's clear it's not him who sent us that scary message.
Alan​​​​​​: I apologize for not being the person you were looking for.
[Gumball flicks Alan away]
Alan​​​​​​: [Off-screen] I'm sorry for being so annoying!
[Gumball grabs a rock, but Darwin stops him]
Darwin: Shhh! Walk away, man. Just walk away.
Gumball: [Exhales] You're right. You're right.
[Gumball and Darwin walk off-screen]
Alan​​​​​​: [Off-screen] I apologize for making you leave!
[Gumball runs back and throws a rock at Alan, and pops him]
[The next scene shows the brothers apologizing to Carrie]
Carrie: You know, the fact that you don't know what you're apologizing for means that you basically don't care.
Gumball: How dare you judge my guilt! Do you know how torn and tormented I am? Do you really wanna see my soul weep, Carrie? Do you!?
Carrie: Yeah. Let's see some tears.
Gumball: FINE!
[Gumball strains, and struggles with his face, and tries hard to cry. But no tears come out]
Carrie: Okay, okay! I forgive you! Please, stop before you permanently damage your dignity.
Gumball: [Stops squealing] Cool! See you later. [Sighs] This is exhausting. Let's apologize a little faster.
[Gumball and Darwin approach Masami in the classroom]
Gumball: Hey, Masami! We're sorry for what we've done, and if there's anything we can do to make it up to you, then-
Masami: Oh! Well, actually there are a couple of things-
Gumball: Uh, let me stop you right there. We don't have a lot of time, so I'm just going to placate you with some half-baked lie, and then come up with a lame pretext to bail on you.
Darwin: Sorry, Masami. We gotta go because of some random excuse. Bye!
[They walk away, and go to the stadium. Gumball calls out to Sarah, eating on the bleachers]
Gumball: Hey, girl we don't know! Sorry for never talking to you enough to actually have something to apologize for!
[They go away]
Sarah: [Sadly] My name is Sarah… [She slouches and her head falls off]
[Scene cuts to Darwin talking with Penny]
Darwin: Hey Penny, I'm sorry for never being upfront about my emotions, or having the courage to stand in front of you like a man to tell you how I feel.
Penny: Oh, wow. I never realized you had any feelings towards me. If anyone did, I would have thought it was Gumball.
[From the distance, Gumball is hiding behind a football goalpost]
Gumball: Sorry for being too scared to say it in person! [Runs, and trips on a trash bin. Gets up, and runs again]
[The scene changes to Anais closing her locker. Gumball and Darwin approach her]
Gumball: Hey sis! Sorry I used your red toothbrush. Please don't destroy us.
Anais: The red one? That's not my toothbrush. Mine's the blue one.
Darwin: Wait, I thought the blue one was mine.
Anais: Ohh, you mean we've been…
[Darwin and Anais shudder]
Gumball: Well, at least no one's been using my yellow toothbrush.
Anais: Yellow toothbrush?
Gumball: Yeah. That big one we keep by the side of the bath.
Darwin: You mean dad's back brush?
[Gumball thinks about this, and at first denies it. Then he ponders, then gags as he realizes this]
Gumball: Yup. That's the one.
The Wrath of the Anonymous Poster
[In the library, Gumball is checking the computer]
Gumball: So that's Alan, Tobias, Anais, and…well, I guess that's everyone. Haha! Wow, it's like a massive weight's been lifted off my-what the what? Dude, what's going on with you?
[Darwin is shown having a long cascade of brown hair on his head]
Darwin: Wow! I guess it must have been the stress of everyone being angry at us all the time. I've been losing my hair for years, and never even realized. Uh, what's up with you?
[Friendly woodland creatures flock around Gumball as a light shines down on him]
Gumball: I don't know. I just feel really at peace with the world, as well. [Whispering joyfully] Have I ever told you I love you, Darwin?
Darwin: [Whispering joyfully] Never like this.
[They hug. Then an abrupt buzzing sound cuts of their moment, and scares away the friendly animals. Gumball checks his page online, and gasps]
Gumball: [Deep voice] "I'm coming for you now!"
[Gumball screams, and loses hair]
[Then the lights go off, and the boys both scream. They go out of the library, and run through the dark hallways]
Gumball: We need to get out of here! He's coming for us!
[They try numerous doors, but-]
Darwin: Everything's locked!
Gumball: The only way out is down there.
[He refers to the school's main doors. The distance between them, and the doors seem ominous to them]
Darwin: Okay. You go first.
Gumball: No way, man. The guy at the front always gets hit.
Darwin: Fine. I'll go first.
Gumball: No wait! I don't wanna be in the back. The guy at the back is the easiest to pick off.
Darwin: Well, what do you want me to do?
[They end up with Gumball wearing Darwin like a suit. Darwin chokes while they walk towards the exit]
Gumball: Dude, be quiet. We're nearly at the front door.
Darwin: [Choked] Your ears are tickling my gills.
[Darwin sneezes, and sends Gumball flying towards the doors. Gumball gasps, and gets up, then runs towards the doors, only for them to close shut]
Gumball: We're locked in!
Darwin: Who are you? Why are you doing this to us?!
Gumball: Let's think! It's gotta be the person we least expect.
Darwin: Well, I suppose the person I least expect …is me.
Gumball: [Gasps] Of course! It can only be you! [Walks menacingly towards Darwin]
Darwin: [Backs away] Wait! By the same logic, and can be you as well.
[Darwin bumps Miss Simian's trophy collection. He winces, then grabs a trophy with a calculator]
Darwin: Back down!
Gumball: Ahh-! Wait. What're you gonna do, divide me by zero?
[Darwin replaces the trophy, and takes one of a person fencing with a sharp foil]
Darwin: I said STEP BACK!
Gumball: [Screams, then grabs a mop next to him] You stay away from me, man! [Dips the mop into a bucket] This water's really old!
[From the anonymous poster's POV, behind a pair of doors]
Mysterious Figure: You have foolishly fallen into my trap. Now you will destroy yourselves, and your friendship at the same time. Maybe then you'll understand my pain!
[Gumball and Darwin continue chattering, and waving their "weapons"]
Gumball: I don't want to fight you, man!
Darwin: I don't want to either. But it looks like that's what's happening.
Gumball: Well, in that case I don't wanna lose!
Darwin: AH! Wait wait wait wait wait! Why don't we just apologize to each other, and then we're cool again.
Gumball: Huh. Oh yeah!
[From the anonymous poster's POV. Gumball drops his mop, and he and Darwin share a hug]
Mysterious Figure: No…no. How dare you rub your friendship in my face. Look at me. I'm talking to you! LOOK AT ME!
[The trophy case beside the brothers explodes. Gumball and Darwin cough as the anonymous poster bursts through the doors hiding the poster. It is revealed to be William]
Gumball: WHAT!? William!? But we've never done anything wrong to you, dude.
[William concentrates his eye on them, summoning his psychic powers]
Gumball: Run.
Darwin: Okay! I'll go first.
Gumball: No wait! I should go first.
Darwin: What? Why?
Gumball: Uh, because there might be danger ahead? I just want to protect you.
Darwin: I'm not going at the back. He's definitely going to attack the guy at the back.
Gumball: I've got just the solution.
[Scene cuts to Gumball riding Darwin, fleeing from William. William uses his psychic powers to disfigure, and virtually destroy the hallway as he chases them. He levitates a gas can, and hurls it towards the Wattersons. The Wattersons barely avoid the ensuing explosion]
William: There is no escape. What the?
[They are gone]
Darwin: What do we do now?
[Gumball and Darwin are seen in the boys' bathroom]
Gumball: I don't know. How do you fight an eye?
Darwin: Dude, shampoo! It's like the stingiest thing in the world.
[Gumball and Darwin jump away just in time as an explosion rips through the room. William comes in]
Darwin: [Whistles] Hey, William! Feast your eye on this!
[Darwin squeezes a bottle of shampoo in his hand, intending for it to squirt at William. Instead, the bottom ruptures, and the shampoo covers Darwin's face]
Darwin: [Screams] MY EYES! AHHH-oh, wait. It's not that bad [Chuckles] It's baby shampoo.
[William focuses on Darwin]
Gumball: Watch out!
[Gumball pushes Darwin out of the way, just as William unleashes his psychic power at the spot where Darwin was. He crumples some pipes, causing the room to fog up]
William: You cannot hide from me. Turn Around. Turn around, and face me like men! I am talking to you.
[Gumball and Darwin are huddled in a corner. Gumball sights William coming at them through the fog]
Gumball: [Whispering] There he is, creeping up on us in silence again.
William: In silence? [Realizes no one can hear him] Oh, gosh. No one can hear me, can they? I suppose that makes sense, I don't have a mouth. I thought you'd ignored me on purpose all my life. But when you blocked me on Elmore Plus, something snapped. What was I thinking? I'm so sorry. You must be terrified and confused, I cannot apologize enough-
Darwin: NOW!
[They turn around, with Gumball holding a racket. He swats William, and William flies out of a window.]
