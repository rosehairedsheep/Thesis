School Photos
[The episode fades from black, showing Gumball with his back to the camera. After moving to the music's beat for a while, he turns around and poses for a photo. The camera snaps a photo, which shows an ugly Gumball. He continues to make several more poses, but all photos end up unsightly. Gumball starts crying. There is a long line of students behind him. Mr. Small, who was taking the photos, approaches Gumball and attempts to comfort him]
Banana Joe: Come on, we've been here all morning!
Tobias​​​​: Yeah, hurry up!
Leslie​​​​: Come on!
Mister Small​​​​: Hey, take it easy, little guy. You're putting too much pressure on yourself.
Gumball: Is it really too much to ask to have a decent school photo once in my life? [Continues crying]
Mister Small​​​​: Come on, it can't be that bad. [Picks up photos of Gumball, starts snickering uncontrollably, then takes a deep breath] Have you ever tried Shotofop?
Gumball: [Hands Mr. Small a bunch of photos] I've tried everything!
[Mr. Small looks through a series of Gumball's photos; each photo shows Gumball's awkward face being progressively blurred]
Gumball: [Sobs] The only solution was to airbrush my whole face out.
[Banana Joe runs into the photo studio, holding a pose]
Banana Joe: [Pants] Get out of the way! I can't hold this much longer! I've been holding this pose since breakfast! [Attempts to do so, then his banana skin splits at the belly. He gasps] Uh, it's okay. I'll just turn this way. [Changes pose. His banana skin splits in another part, and he gasps again] Let's just do a head shot. [Changes pose, and his banana skin splits apart at the head] Just take the photo! [Attempts to close his head split] Take the photo! [Camera shutter clicks. He becomes very angry] You'll pay for this, Gumball Watterson! [Stomps away from the photo studio]
Gumball: Please, Mr. Small. I can't be remembered this way. [Grabs Mr. Small's shirt and buries his face into it, muffling his speech] Just give me one more chance!
Mister Small​​​​: I'm sorry, but... I got to return the camera at three. [Gumball cries into his shirt. He sighs] Oh, all righty. Just come back at three. I'll take one last picture, and that's it. Okay?
[Gumball stops crying and takes his face off Mr. Small's shirt, his face smeared with rainbow print]
Gumball: You're a good man.
Mister Small​​​​: Next.
[Gumball walks away. Carrie enters the photo studio, and Mr. Small clicks the camera. A photo comes out, and they both look at it. It shows just the backdrop; Carrie cannot be seen on it]
Carrie: I'm not paying for that. [Phases through the photo backdrop]
Inner Beauty
[The students are in the hallway checking their photos out]
Tobias​​​​: Man, I look good.
[Penny laughs at her photo]
Darwin: You know what the real problem is with this?
Gumball: That I look like I should [Makes a face exactly like the one on his photo] speak like this?
Alan​​​​: No. The problem is, you need to learn to accept yourself for who you are.
Gumball: That’s easy for you to say, with your perfect face. [Gestures toward Alan’s photo]
Alan​​​​: It’s not that perfect. All you can see is my mole.
[Zoom in on Alan’s mole, which looks exactly like Alan himself]
Gumball: Dude, even your mole looks better on-camera than me.
Alan​​​​: Real beauty comes from within. You should – [Gumball blows him away] What – what are you doing?
Gumball: It’s bad enough... [Blows] that you’re a million times prettier than I am. [Blows] I don’t need you to rub in my face... [Blows] ...how mature and deep you are!
Alan​​​​: It’s okay. I understand.
[Gumball inhales deeply and blows him away]
Gumball: I can’t stand that guy.
Darwin: He’s right, though. Look inside yourself, and you’ll see how beautiful you are.
[Gumball pops off one of his eyes and puts it inside his mouth]
Gumball: All I can see is brains, guts, and some of today’s breakfast. [Replaces his eye]
Darwin: Yeah, I know. I was lying so you wouldn't be whining about your school photo all day. Just deal with it. You’re not photogenic, and there’s nothing you can do about it.
Boy's Toilet
[Gumball tries to carry two dumbbells taped on two ends on his lips]
Darwin: I don't see how this is going to make you look better.
Gumball: Because the face is a muscle, the more you train it, the more awesome it looks.
[Gumball tries to lift them up higher and then stops]
Gumball: Yeah I think that's enough.
[Gumball rips the tape off and drops the dumbbells]
Gumball: Check this out.
[Gumball takes a few deep breaths]
Gumball: Hrggghhhbbllrr...
[Gumball's face turns puffy]
Darwin: Wow.
Gumball: The most important thing is to smile with your eyes!
Darwin: That makes absolutely no sense.
Gumball: Just tell me if I'm doing it right!
[Gumball's face changes back to normal]
Darwin: Mm, mm, that's a lot better now.
Gumball: Good! [Gumball's eyes are both replaced by mouths and his voice gets tripled]
[Gumball gets some water from his water bottle, rinses his mouth and the water spews out from his right eye into the bucket]
Gumball: This is horrific, isn't it?
Darwin: Mhm. [Nods]
[Gumball kneels down and cries]
Darwin: Are you crying or dribbling?
Gumball: I don't know anymore!
School Field
[Bobert is shooting a laser at Gumball's forehead, burning off his fur]
Darwin: Dude, what are you doing?
Gumball: Getting a tan.
Darwin: I think you're making too much of a big deal out of this photo thing.
Gumball: Are you kidding?! My life plan was built around me being good-looking!
Darwin: Didn't you wanna be a doctor?
Gumball: No, I wanted to be a handsome doctor, or maybe a lifeguard.
Darwin: You don't need to be handsome to be a lifeguard.
Gumball: Are you serious? If you were drowning and this [Takes out a photo of Gumball showing a funny face] came to the rescue, you'd swim downwards!
[Gumball's forehead catches on fire, and Darwin screams, flailing his arms and tries to put out of the fire as Bobert runs away but Gumball moves away]
Gumball: Leave it! I burned, I peel and it's tan!
[Gumball's entire face catches on fire]
Darwin: Look, if that photo is so important to you, why don't you just ask somebody for some beauty tips.
Gumball: Like who?
Darwin: Well, a guy who always look good in photos.
[Bobert comes back with a fire extinguisher and puts out the fire]
Hallway
[Alan floats peacefully but is stopped. He turns back]
Gumball: Alright, tell me your secret!
Alan​​​​: [Sighs] Okay... I anonymously donate all my allowance to charity, but I don't want anyone to know because it's not about me, it's about the cause...
Gumball: Arhhh, you're so nice, it's disgusting! I didn't mean that secret, tell me why you look perfect in every photo.
Alan​​​​: I don't know what you're talking about!
Gumball: Oh really? Well, I can understand how you look awesome in a staged school photo with a nice background and flattering lighting, but how do you explain this?! [Takes out a photo that shows Alan's handsome face on a school race] This is you after you won a marathon! In ninety degree heat! With the flu!
Alan​​​​: Hey, the real winner there was the photographer!
Gumball: Oh yeah, then how do you explain this one?! [Takes out another photo showing Alan peacefully resting in bed]
Alan​​​​: How did you get that?
Gumball: Doesn't matter, now stop holding out on me and tell me how to take the perfect photo!
Alan​​​​: I just look at the camera and smile!
Gumball: [Sighs] Now listen here, you no-good-lying hunk, if you don't tell me your secret, I'll have no choice but to buy you a one-way ticket to pain town.
Alan​​​​: Gumball, there is no secret.
Gumball: [Sigh] You made me do this. [Pushes Alan to the floor, only making him bounce off and hit Gumball] Ow! [Repeats] Ah! Darn it! [Repeats] Face me like a man! [Repeats a few more times]
[The scene skips to Gumball, Alan and Darwin again, with Gumball having a black eye and beaten-up face. Gumball weakly punches Alan again and again. He gets tired and falls back]
Alan​​​​: Uh, are you done? Because I'm late for Math.
Gumball: Fine, we'll call it a tie.
Boy's Bathroom
[Gumball looks at himself in the mirror]
Gumball: Aw man, I'm never gonna get a decent photo. My face looks like a dropped cake.
Darwin: It's not so bad, maybe we could just... uh... [Squeezes Gumball's face] Ewwh, uh, let me just uh... [Tries to fix Gumball's face] Oh, your face is surprisingly malleable! Check this out! [Reshapes Gumball's face] Hamburger! [Giggles]
Gumball: Dude!
Darwin: Oh wait, wait, wait. [Reshapes Gumball's face again] Mustache! [Laughs] Oh... [Reshapes Gumball's face again] Infinite mustache! [Laughs]
Gumball: [Shakes his head vigorously and his face sags] You're not helping right now.
Darwin: [Stops laughing] Sorry man. At least you know if handsome doctor doesn't work out, you can work as a test dummy for a cosmetic surgeon.
Gumball: Hmmm...
Darwin: [Holds up a picture of a man] Okay... and I think we're done. [Puts down photo]
Gumball: How does it look?
Darwin: Now, I'm gonna show you in a minute but before I do, just remember, I am not a professional plastic surgeon.
Gumball: Yeah yeah, it's fine, just show me the mirror!
Darwin: And, and uh... I didn't ask you for any money either when a specialist would've dealed you for thousands of dollars.
Gumball: Just show me!
Darwin: Okay, but keep in mind that this is what you asked for. [Shows Gumball the mirror]
[Gumball starts to touch his face and Darwin shivers in fear]
Gumball: I... look... awesome!
[Darwin is relieved and smiles at this reply. The school bell rings and Gumball and Darwin run around the bathroom]
Gumball and Darwin: AH! We gotta get to the gym!
Darwin: Wait, that's the two o'clock bell. We've got another hour.
Gumball: Really? That's never happened before. Hmmm... [Pinches chin thoughtfully]
Through the Hallway
[They open the door. Eventually they walk in the hallway]
Gumball: Dude, things never go this right for us.
Darwin: Something terrible is gonna happen, isn't it?
Gumball: Someone's gonna ruin my chance to get a good photo. I can feel it.
Darwin: But who would want to do that?
[Cuts to Banana Joe angrily looking at his ruined photo]
Banana Joe: You will pay for this humiliation, Gumball Watterson!
[He crumples the photo and throws it to a filled trash bin, only for it to roll back to him multiple times. After some attempts, he calms down and does a good throw. The photo lands in the trashcan]
Banana Joe: Yes!
Mister Small​​​​​: [Passing by] Uh, paper goes in the recycling bin.
Banana Joe: [Groans] Recycle THIS!
[He takes the photo, and chews it up. After almost choking on it, he puts it in the recycling bin and walks off. Then cuts back to Gumball and Darwin]
Gumball: I don't know who'd want to ruin my photo. But that's the problem. If I can't think of anybody, it could be…everybody.
[They see lots of their fellow students talking to each other. Then they sense him, and turn towards him in silence. His appearance creeps them out]
Darwin: [Whispering] I'm scared, dude. Are you?
Gumball: Terrified. But my face can't express it.
[They walk nervously through them]
Gumball: Okay. I think we're safe.
Tobias​​​​​: AH! Watch out! There's some kind of hot goblin freak right next to you!
Gumball: [Hides behind Darwin] What?! Where?
Darwin: I wouldn't worry about it, dude.
Tobias​​​​​: RUN! It's hideous!
Gumball: AH What's he talking about?! Where is it?!
Darwin: Trust me man. You're fine.
Gumball: Wait a minute. He thinks you're the hot goblin!
Darwin: Yeah…sure. I'm the hot goblin.
Gumball: [Laughs]
[Meanwhile, Banana Joe walks angrily in the hallway. He bumps into various students (and hurts his arm when he bumps into Bobert)]
Suspenseful Hallway
[While the boys continue on their way, there is a humming noise]
Darwin: [Terrified] Why am I feeling so tense?
Gumball: It's that noise.
Darwin: What noise?
Gumball: The one they use in horror films to show something terrible's coming your way.
[Then Tina roars in the distance]
Gumball: [Terrified] Like that!
Darwin: Quick. It's Tina!
[They run by Mr. Small's office, where he is meditating (revealing he is the source of the humming). Then the lights start flashing]
Darwin: What's going on with the lights?
Gumball: I don't know! Just keep running! Where is she!?
[The lights flash on and off ominously as Tina roars many times. Then they come by a door from where they see Tina inside. It turns out that Tina is roaring from trying to do a split]
Penny: Come on, Tina! You have to be more flexible than that if you wanna join the team.
Darwin: Hm. That was a bit anti-climatic.
Gumball: Yeah. What's going on with the lights though?
[They see Sussie repeatedly flipping a light switch]
Sussie: Night! Day! Night! Day! Night! Day! [Eager sound]
Gumball: Well, I'm starting to think there's nothing to ruin my photo after all.
[Meanwhile, Banana Joe continues to walk angrily in the hallway (again). He gets weary from doing this, but recomposes himself and continues]
Gumball: I really don't know what we were worried about. It's just a photo.
[They are surprised by Alan (who ignores them, or doesn't seem aware of them). He floats towards their direction]
Darwin: [Quietly] Here we go…this is it. Come and get us…all smiles hiding his fury.
Gumball: Yeah. He definitely wants to get even because I whooped his butt earlier. He's gonna do something!
Darwin: [Quietly] But what, dude? What?
Gumball: How do you defend yourself from the unknown?
Darwin: With a preemptive strike.
[Alan passes by them. Then Darwin pops him]
Gumball: [Gasps] …I am so sorry. We completely overreacted there. I just thought you were gonna stop me from-
Alan​​​​: Shhhh…It's okay. I understand. It was an accident.
Darwin: Well, not really. I kinda went for it.
Alan​​​​: Could you please flip over that bit of rubber next to your foot?
Gumball: [Flips it over] Uh sure. Why?
Alan​​​​: Because I'm turning the other cheek.
Gumball: [Gags] Dude, you're so nice it's actually sickening.
Darwin: Well. Now we know that no one is after us, and we're twenty minutes early for your photo.
Gumball: Nothing can stop us now!
In The Gym
Banana Joe: GUMBALL WATTERSON, WHERE ARE YOU?! Come and fight me LIKE A MAN!
[He takes off his peel, and swings it around like nunchackus. Then (unfortunately since he is standing near the door) he is squished unintentionally by Gumball and Darwin entering the gym]
Gumball: I know right? For the first time in my life, I'm actually early.
[He then prepares for his photo shoot]
Gumball: Okay, let's do this!
Mister Small​​​​: Right. And you’re sure you're happy with your weird face, because this is the last photo I'm taking of you.
Gumball: [Gasps] Ready when you are. [Poses]
Mister Small​​​​: Okay then. On three. One…two…
[Gumball sneezes as he falls off the stool, ruining his last picture. The episode ends]
