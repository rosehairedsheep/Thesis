Searching the Attic
[The episode starts with Gumball and Darwin in the attic; they are seen packing old toys away, preparing for the garage sale]
Darwin: Why do we have to give them away? These toys have sentimental value! It's not like anyone else will love them like we do!
Gumball: Dude, we've locked them in the attic for, like, seven years.
Darwin: [Finds a Smack-It in the box] Wow! Why did we ever stop playing with this thing? It was awesome!
[Smack-It music plays]
Smack It: Push me! [Voice and music go lower pitched and distorted] Hold me… Squeeze me…
Darwin: Hmm, it never sounded as kid-friendly after we dropped it. [Throws into bag] But look, remember our old digi-pet? [Takes digipet out of box] We had to feed it and change its diaper and stuff. [Presses Button]
[The digi-pet has a blank screen]
Darwin: Mm, out of batteries. [Throws into box]
[The words "CLEAN ME" appear on the digi-pet's screen]
Darwin: [Gasps] Mighty Flyz! The warrior that rules the sky!
[The Mighty Flyz figure goes around breaking things while Darwin and Gumball cover themselves in panic. It flies out the window cutting a wire and killing a bird]
Gumball: [In advertiser's voice] Mighty Flyz takes no responsibility for any limbs, eyes, or innocence lost while enjoying the Mighty Flyz line of products. [Normal voice] What else could we give away? [Looks in box and eyes widen, talks in shock] You've not seen them yet, but no.
Darwin: Seen what?
Gumball: [Insistant] No!
Darwin: [Grabs box and looks inside; gasps] Grady, Frank and Howdy! Aw, Gumball we have to play with-
Gumball: [Even more strict] No!
Darwin: But why?
Gumball: Because we're too old to play with toys and dolls.
Darwin: Playing never goes out of date.
Gumball: Playing with dolls means that you'll never go out ON a date.
[Darwin's expression becomes a sad puppy face]
Gumball: Come on, man. Time to grow up.
Darwin: [Sighs] You're right. I need to learn how to let things go.
Gumball: That's it, trust me, you'll thank me when your teenage years kick in.
Darwin: I know…
[Gumball exits the attic and slams the door]
Darwin: [Giggles in mischief; pulls out the puppets] Hello, guys!
Frank and Howdy, being ventriloquized by Darwin: Hello!
[They all cough, due to the dust that has been gathering Frank and Howdy]
Darwin: Eww, what's that smell?
Frank: Morning breath can be quite bad when you've been asleep in a shoebox for seven years!
Howdy: Come on, Frank! I'm sure Darwin had a perfectly good reason to leave us in there in endless darkness! With only dust mites for our food and our love for him to keep us warm, right?!
[Darwin's head is flattened by an imaginary force of "guilt"]
Howdy: What was that?
Darwin: That was the weight of guilt, Howdy. [Inhales in air, allowing his head to restore its usual form] I'm sorry, we ditched you guys the Christmas we got our first game console.
Frank: That's okay. We still love you.
Howdy: And you'll never put us back in the box, will you?
Darwin: I promise.
Frank: And we will have fun forever and ever?
Darwin: I promise.
Howdy: And you'll never take us off your hands again, right?
Darwin: I promise.
[The scene cuts to Darwin exiting the bathroom, the puppets expressing horrendous shock]
Darwin: Sorry, but you did make me promise.
Darwin's Obsession
[The scene cuts to Gumball and Darwin waiting for the bus to come; once the bus arrives, Howdy, still being controlled by Darwin, encounters Rocky, driving the bus]
Howdy: [Dreamily] Ooh! Where have you been all my life?
Rocky: Mmm, sitting here wondering what went wrong with mine, while eating cheese.
Howdy: Well… One ticket to kiss-town, please.
[Romantic music plays as they get closer to kiss; Rocky realizes that Darwin was attempting to recreate said music]
Rocky: [Furiously] What the?! Dude!
[Darwin walks away in nervously; immediately his distraction causes him to drive in a path of a truck about to collide. All students scream as they crash into the truck; the scene cuts to Rocky horribly injured serving students in the cafeteria. Darwin walks by, blushing in embarrassment]
Howdy: [Whispering] Call me.
Rocky: [Shaking his head] Mmph.
[As Darwin sits on a table, he struggles to control the puppets in order to eat the sandwich; Gumball enters to sit, placing his tray. Darwin hides the puppets under the table]
Gumball: Dude! The school bus is a total write-off! I guess that's what happens when you put a fifteen-ton vehicle in the limp little hands of a ventriloquist dummy.
[Gumball proceeds to imitate Rocky by speaking like him and flailing his arms; Frank and Howdy, still under the table, pull an angry expression]
Frank: Hey! What's wrong with being a puppet?
Howdy: Big talk from someone so short that you can see his feet on his yearbook photo.
Gumball: [Does not notice the puppets] What's your problem, man? And what's with the voice?
Frank: My problem is that your butt is trying twice as wide as your shoulders, but your brain is half the size of your head!
Gumball: [In disgust] Oh! Anything else?
Howdy: No. I can try to insult your face, but I think nature's already done enough damage.
[Gumball removes the meat from his hamburger, taking the bun out, and proceeds to slap Darwin's face with the meat]
Howdy: At least that solved the problem about eating without your hands.
[The scene cuts to the Wattersons' house, with Darwin taking a bath in the bathroom but still ventriloquizing the puppets]
Frank: Oh my goodness! Who skinned those puppets?
Darwin: [Soft voice] Shh! Those are my socks, and keep it down or Gumball will hear you.
Gumball: [Opening the bathroom door] Did you say something?
Darwin: [Nervously] No.
Gumball: Then who were you just talking to?
[The puppets struggle in the water, making gurgling noises; Darwin persists to reveal them]
Darwin: [Nervously] Nobody.
[As Gumball pulls a suspicious expression, Darwin nervously struggles to keep the puppets in the water; he fails, causing the puppets to emerge quickly and take deep breaths]
Gumball: Ah, I knew it!
Darwin: Guys, you don't even have lungs.
Frank and Howdy: Oh yeah.
Gumball: Darwin, we've been over this.
Darwin: [Exiting the bathtub with his feet censored] You don't understand! They're more than jus—
Gumball: [Hiding from the horrifying view of his feet] Darwin, dude! Can you cover yourself up first?
Darwin: [Blushing] Oh, yeah, sorry. [Puts on his slippers]
Howdy: But Gumball, we are more than just puppets!
Gumball: Darwin, you know who talks through puppets? Crazy people, and people who want to make a living as a ventriloquist. So, yeah, crazy people, basically.
Frank: Gumball, we need you too. Who's gonna play with Grady?
Gumball: Dude, no, just take them off.
Frank and Howdy: [Refusing] No!
[Darwin indirectly assails Gumball through the puppets by beating his face]
Frank: The fun will never end!
Gumball: Darwin, stop!
[Frank shoves a toilet paper roll in his mouth]
Frank: Wait, what are we doing?
Gumball: [Muffles Darwin] Finally! Thank you.
Howdy: You're supposed to fall over, not under!
[Frank throws the toilet paper at Gumball]
Howdy: Frank, stop it! [Hits Frank]
Frank: Ow! No, you stop! [Hits Howdy]
Howdy: Ow!
Darwin: You both stop! [Both of the puppets hit each other]
Howdy and Frank: Ow! No, you stop! Yah! [Both hit Darwin, causing him to slip and fall]
Gumball: [Grabs showerhead and points it at Darwin] Aha!
[The showerhead fails to shoot any water]
Gumball: [Sighs] You used up all the water.
[Howdy takes the rug under Gumball, causing him to fall; Frank and Howdy go over to the pedal bin, then Frank is pushing the foot pedal of the trash can to hit Gumball's face with the lid. Gumball seizes the puppets, pulling them off Darwin's hand and causing Darwin to launch into the bathtub]
Gumball: [Exhausted] Darwin, when I said grow up, I didn't mean go straight to the part where you're in a retirement home screaming at chairs and biting the nurses.
Packed Away
[The scene cuts to the frontyard of the house, with Gumball about to place the puppets in a box and to throw them into the trash can; Darwin is desperately preventing him to do so by holding his legs back]
Darwin: [Urging] No, please don't do this! You don't understand! They're alive!
Gumball: [Strictly] No, they are not! [Puts the puppets in the box and closes them]
Darwin voicing Howdy: No! Not the shoebox!
Darwin now voicing Frank: It's almost as dark as your soul in here! No!
[Gumball is surprised by their voices, but later finds out that Darwin is still voicing them in an attempt to convince him back]
Darwin: [Normal voice] Oh.
Gumball: Yeah, dude, they are not the ones who need help. [Exits off-screen]
[Due to the situation, Darwin turns his head down, blushes and sweats; he exits back to the house depressedly]
The Puppets' Resurrection
[The scene shows the Wattersons' house suddenly transitioning into nighttime. While Gumball is soundly sleeping in his bedroom. In the frontyard, the trash can falls off, then appears Howdy, now "alive"]
Howdy: [Now non-ventriloquized and speaking with her real voice] Frank! You ok? You don't look quite yourself!
Frank, as a food container: [In his real voice] Maybe there's something I haven't digested properly. [Vomits a rat]
Howdy: [Surprised] Woo! Frank, wrong body!
Frank: Ohh. [Apparently, his spirit transfers to his correct puppet "body"] Okay! Let's go!
[Howdy and Frank drag Grady to the house, whose spirit is still "unconscious." They open the door, sternly entering the house]
Frank: Okay, the bedroom's just at the top of the stairs.
Howdy: Wait. [Grabs a baseball bat]
[Gumball wakes up and walks down the stairs, frightened at the clanking and banging noise that is heard; it is revealed that Howdy has been destroying his console, along with his The Tale of Zelmore cartridge. Howdy immediately hides at Gumball's presence]
Gumball: [Gasps] Nooohoohoo! [Proceeds to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation upon the broken console, nervously panting in the process] Come on, breathe! What have you done?! [Welling up tears]
Howdy: We taught that thing a lesson for replacing us!
Gumball: I'm not talking to you!
[The scene reveals Darwin, though sound asleep, unwillingly holding the puppets. The two puppets speak by themselves]
Gumball: I'm talking to Darwin! Why did you fish them out of the trash?!
Frank: He made a promise never to abandon us.
Gumball: You can't make a promise to an object! That's like getting married to a fridge, or keeping a secret for a shoe, and please stop talking through those puppets!
Howdy: He can't. He lives in our world now.
Frank: And if you want to see him again, you too will have to come and play!
[Both puppets close their eyes, causing Darwin to fall on the floor and transferring themselves to their "world"]
Gumball: [Gasps] Darwin! Wake up! Wake up!
[Gumball then sternly looks at Grady and takes him; he then places his hand inside him, summoning his conscience]
Grady: Thank you, Master Gumball. I missed you greatly all these years. Now, shall we go and find Master Darwin?
Gumball: Wait, how do you know what happened?
Grady: Just because I've been unable to talk does not mean that I have been unable to see.
Gumball: Remind me to apologize to Anais' dolls. They're right next to my underpants drawer. They've seen a lot.
A Whole New World
[Grady puts his hand out; Gumball puts his hand onto his hand, summoning them both to the puppets' world]
Gumball: [Realizes his hand is in a form of a puppet's] Ahh! What the what? What happened to me? Wait-awa? [Realizes his whole body is that of a puppet's; screams in horror]
Grady: [Appears also as a real puppet] If that worried you sir, I advise you not to look down.
[The scene reveals that there are two humans in chroma key green screen suits controlling them. Gumball and Grady look down at them]
Gumball: [Nervously] Okay, Gumball. Focus on the task at hand, not hand! Focus on the task at hand— Ahead! T—Task ahead!
Grady: [Puts his finger on Gumball's mouth] Shhhh... shush. Can you hear that, Master Gumball?
[Howdy is heard off-screen, chanting]
Howdy: [Off-screen] The fun will never end!
Grady: This way.
[Gumball and Grady proceed but struggle to walk, due to their abnormally thin legs]
Gumball: Wow! Look at all the things we imagined when we used to play!
[Scene introduces High-Five Guy, smiling]
Gumball: Hey look, it's High-Five Guy! Ah, good to see you, man! [Slaps him in the face, making him sigh while pulling a disturbed expression]
Gumball: [Gasps] It's Sammy Sunscream, the screaming sun!
[Sammy Sunscream, off-screen, screams in agony while shining upon Gumball and High-Five Guy]
Gumball: [Walks in with a tree] The Tree of Permanent Happiness!
The Tree of Permanent Happiness: I wish I could feel other things.
Gumball: [Gasps] Bird-Plane-Bird!
[Scene shows Bird-Plane-Bird, a creature fused of a plane and a bird; it crows]
Grady: Please stay focused, sir. Master Darwin needs you.
Gumball: Yeah, you're right. So just stop distracting me, Keyboard Dog!
Keyboard Dog: [Being revealed] Arf! Arf! Arf! [Plays his implemented keyboard]
The Fun Will Never End
[The scene changes to Gumball and Grady facing the house in which Darwin and the puppets are in]
Grady: Here we are.
[In the house, the scene changes to Howdy and Frank singing "The Fun Will Never End"]
Howdy: Dance around and sing a song!
The fun will never stop, yeah!
Frank: We have fun all day long,
It says so on the clock!
Howdy: So wear a hat, wear no hat!
Frank: Or wear two hats, if you prefer!
We only have two hats,
So those are your only options.
Howdy: So put them on and bake a cake!
Frank: And while you wait for the cake to bake,
Begin to prepare a second cake.
Howdy: [Slapping the cake off Darwin's fin] You did it wrong with that first cake.
[Awkward silence occurs as the cake melts on the floor]
Frank: It's your turn with the balloon!
Howdy and Frank: The fun will never end!
Howdy: Organize a spoon!
Howdy and Frank: The fun will never end!
Frank: Count to the funnest number!
Number Seven: The fun will never end!
Howdy: Go to your favorite corner!
Howdy and Frank: The fun will never end!
Darwin: I don't know what's going on.
Howdy and Frank: The fun will never end!
Darwin: I'm not sure this is that fun.
Howdy and Frank: The fun will never end!
[Gumball opens the door and imitates a record scratch noise with his mouth]
Howdy: What was that?
Gumball: A dramatic record scratch sound. [To Darwin] Dude, we gotta go! This is all a trap to keep you playing with them forever!
[A loud dissonant piano chord sounds as Grady maliciously enters]
Grady: You're wrong. You see, there are three of us, Master Gumball, and Darwin only has two hands. This was a trap for you. Dum, dum, dum.
Gumball: What was that?
Grady: Mmm, a dramatic music cue. It would have been better if my voice wasn't so flat.
[Grady closes the door shut as he goes to the darkness; the two other puppets close the door as they exit; Gumball and Darwin tremble like they're being possessed]
Grady: You always used to play with us.
[The door in front of the camera shuts, the scene now transitioning to Gumball and Darwin in the form of hand puppets. Grady, Howdy and Frank all stare menacingly down at both, in giant sizes]
Grady: Now's our turn to play with you!
Howdy: So play along don't make a fuss!
Frank: And we'll come up with things to do!
Grady: We'll make you dance, we'll make you fight.
Howdy: You'll smear yourself with worms all night!
Grady: We'll make you eat toenails and grease!
Frank: We'll make you wear an itchy fleece!
Grady: We'll see if you break when you bend!
The fun will never end! The fun will ne- [Notices Darwin holding some string; spoken] Wait, what's that?
Darwin: The end of the fun.
[Grady gasps as Darwin pulls a string from his arm, causing it to fall off; all of them gasp as Gumball and Darwin fall and grow their legs back]
Gumball: Run!
[As they run away, Darwin pulls more strings, making Howdy's right eye to sever and Frank's abdomen to mangle up]
Puppets: [Distant] Noooo!
Darwin: Is it me or is that kinda underwhelming?
Gumball: Yeah, I sorta thought everything would explode or something.
Darwin: Wait, isn't this all imaginary?
Gumball: Oh, good point.
Puppets: Noooo!
[Everything in their world surrounding them explodes]
Grady: I will have my revenge!
Back to Normal
[The scene then transitions to Gumball and Darwin sitting on the stairs normally as Nicole does her yard sale; Billy walks in and notices the puppets, packed in a box, in delight]
Nicole: Sure you're okay with me giving away your old toys?
[As Billy picks him up from the box, Grady assails Billy behind Nicole, hitting him several times and causing him to scream]
Gumball and Darwin: Yeah, pretty sure!
