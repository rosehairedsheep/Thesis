Tobias​​​​​​: Oh, uh...Sorry, dudes, I totally forgot. I-I'll bring it in tomorrow, I swear! [Tobias walks off]
Gumball: Awww.
Darwin: Awww.
[The next day. Gumball and Darwin angrily approach Tobias in the hallway]
Gumball: So, did you remember the game?
Tobias​​​​​​: [Tobias inhales sharply] Sorry, dudes. I'll totally bring it in tomorrow.
[The location changes numerous times as Tobias makes more and more excuses for not bringing Gumball and Darwin's game back]
Tobias​​​​​​: Mm...I am so sorry. I-I'll bring it in tomorrow, I pro- Oooh, I'm so- Mm. Ah...I- Mm, mm- Ah- Oh, oh, oh! Mm...Ah, ah- S-s-s-sorry! Ah- Tomor, tomor- Tom-mor-or-orrow! Mmm...I-I-I-I...Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm...
Gumball: Dude! You've done this for so long, now, even your little "sorry" sounds are all the same!
Tobias​​​​​​: Oh, sorry. You thought tomorrow was today; I meant tomorrow tomorrow. I'll bring it in tomorrow, I swear! [Tobias laughs] See ya!
Gumball: Okay, let's analyze the situation here. He's abusing our patience, retaining our property, and all civilized methods to deal with this problem have failed. I think we have ourselves a case for a war. Are you ready to follow me into battle?
Darwin: [In a nervous tone] Um, actually, you know what? I thought maybe I could take the lead this time...
Gumball: What?
Darwin: Yeah. I'd like to have a try at being the leader.
Gumball: [Gumball laughs at Darwin] Why?
[Sad violin music starts to play as Darwin begins to sob]
Darwin: Uhh...'Cause sometimes, I look at myself in the mirror, and all I see...is nothing but a sidekick!
Gumball: Hold on a second. [It turns out the violin music was coming from Leslie nearby, and he shuts the door] Sorry. What were you saying?
Darwin: [Darwin sighs] Nevermind...
[The episode then cuts to Gumball and Darwin playing on computers in the library. Darwin clicks on something, and it makes him angry. The computer makes a "ding-ding!" sound as Darwin clicks]
Darwin: [In a furious tone] DAH!
Gumball: What?
Darwin: Look! More proof I'm your sidekick!
Gumball: Are you still going on about that? Look, you get loads of emails! "Hey Darwin," "hi Darwin," "hello Darwin."
Darwin: Yeah, but this is your inbox! People didn't even think I've got my own email address! You wanna see mine?
[Darwin shows Gumball his email inbox. It appears to be very old and damaged. A cockroach can even be seen crawling inside of it]
Gumball: Eww... [He tries touching it] What the? Is that cockroach inside your inbox?
Darwin: See what I mean?
Gumball: Some people send me your emails. It doesn't make you my sidekick.
Darwin: Oh yeah? Then what about... [Darwin wheels Gumball to Miss Simian's classroom, bringing the school yearbook along with him] The school yearbook! [He flips open a page] That's your entry...and that's mine! It's not even me! It's a photo of your shadow! I'M. YOUR. SHADOW. And look! "Darwin Watterson. Age: two years younger than Gumball! Class: the same as Gumball! Most likely to be: standing next to GUMBALL! Even my nickname is "GUMBALL'S SIDEKICK!" [Darwin shoves the open book in Gumball's face in the process]
Gumball: [Optimistically] I'm sure mine's probably "Darwin's sidekick"...
Darwin: Uh, no dude. It's "DARWIN'S BOSS!"
Gumball: Chill out! It's just a yearbook! No one actually thinks that!
Darwin: Then, how do you...explain this? [Darwin grabs a nearby student in the hallway, and confronts him face-to-face] Hey you! Look me in the eye and tell me you don't think I'm Gumball's sidekick!
Colin: [He gasps] My Rubik's cube, you can talk! I always thought you were Gumball's orange bag. [Colin then walks off]
Gumball: Oh, that reminds me. Can I have my math book?
Darwin: [He finally calms down] Oh, sure. [He takes Gumball's math book out of his mouth, and gives it to him] But, you see what I mean, though? It's like I don't even exist without you.
Gumball: [He comforts Darwin] Darwin, you do exist, and I understand how you feel. So, we're gonna get that game back as equals! Now, follow me and do everything I tell you!
Darwin: Okay, great! ...Aw, man!
Trying To Sneak In
[Gumball and Darwin are at Tobias' house at night]
Gumball: Perfect! Tobias left his window open! We just have to sneak in, and get our game. Now, bend down.
[Darwin acts as a pedestal for Gumball as he tries to climb in the window]
Darwin: See? This is exactly what I'm talking about! If I'm not your sidekick, then why are you always using me for stupid things like this? If you owned a ladder, you wouldn't need me here at all!
Gumball: Shhh! At least a ladder would know how to shut up when it's helping me to sneak into someone's house!
[Darwin huffs angrily, and he walks into the opposite direction. The window closes in on Gumball's hands, and he falls into their basement]
Darwin: That's for demoting me from a sidekick to a foot-stool!
Gumball: Okay, okay! Point taken, now get me outta here!
Darwin: I'm sorry, but I don't take orders anymore. [Darwin walks home, and leaves Gumball behind]
Gumball: Fine, you're not a sidekick! You're an assistant! I mean, a deputy! Ugh, you're my vice Gumball! [Silence ensues] Dude, you there? You're not speaking to me to make me think you left, right? And if you did, it's just to get some rope? [Another moment of silence occurs] ...You're getting rope? [Again, no answer] Nah, I'm sure he's just gone to get some rope.
You Made Me Like This
[We then cut to the cafeteria. Rocky is serving students food, Gumball and Darwin included]
Rocky: Next!
[Gumball and Darwin are next in line]
Gumball: So...last night, huh? Things got a little...[Gumball hisses] Well, you were there.
Rocky: Next!
Gumball: But, seriously, it's good we're all back to normal now. Same...you know...dynamic. [Gumball offers a high-five from Darwin. Instead, he high-fives himself] Right?
Rocky: Next!
Darwin: I meant what I said.
Rocky: What are ya having?
[Before Darwin can speak, he is interrupted by Gumball]
Gumball: Can I get some tater tots and fish? Oh, put the fish on the side.
[Darwin suddenly becomes enraged. He throws his tray down on the ground, and storms off]
Gumball: I meant on top! Put the fish on top!
[Darwin bursts through various doors through various hallways as Gumball tries to talk to him]
Gumball: Dude, why are you so angry with me?
Darwin: Because it's your fault. You made me like this.
Gumball: What, a fish?
Darwin: No, a sidekick. Is this some kind of...[They walk through a quite long hallway, and Darwin holds his sentence. He finally reaches another door]...joke to you?
Gumball: Of course not, but do you ever think you brought this on yourself?
[Gumball and Darwin realize they just went into a circle. They are back in the lunchroom]
Darwin: This conversation is getting us nowhere.
Gumball: Yeah, you're right. So, let me demonstrate why people think you're a sidekick. [Gumball starts acting happy and optimistic, speaking in a high-pitched voice as well] "Hey, I'm Darwin! Oh, your shoes are dirty! Looks like you could do with a door-mat!" [Gumball forcibly rubs Darwin's shoe on his face with that happy look still on his face] "Hello Gumball! Do you mind holding my hand for my entire life?! What are we gonna do? Where are we gonna go? What are we gonna have for lunch today? Because I find even the simplest decisions baffling!" [Gumball giggles, and runs outside] "Look at that beautiful pigeon pecking the mold off that old chicken leg! Isn't the circle of life beautiful?!" [Gumball starts acting normal again] See my point?
Darwin: Huh, well, at least I'm not like this! [Darwin "imitates" Gumball, and starts to act in a goofy manner. He starts to speak in a deep voice] "Duh! Hey, I'm Gumball! Duh! I'm too busy to look where I'm going, 'cause I'm in love with Penny or something!" [Sarah passes by, and Darwin splatters her lunch all over her] "Duh, hey Sussie! While conveniently ignoring my own character flaws, I'm happy to point out that you eat with the grace of a one-toothed camel!"
Sussie: [Sussie whimpers sadly]
Darwin: "Hey Rocky! Let me help you with lasagna!" "Zoom! Zoom! Zoom!" [Darwin pushes Rocky out of the way, and starts throwing lasagna all over the room, hitting a few students in the process, including Leslie, Carmen, and Juke] "What the what?! I should apologize, but I won't because I always assume I'm in the right! Duh!" [Darwin starts acting normal again] You see my point?
Gumball: It would be hard not to. Okay, you're the boss now. You get that game back from Tobias.
Darwin: [Darwin gasps] Finally! I've been waiting for this for so long! So, what should I do?
Gumball: I don't know. I'd do something dumb and petty, like take something he likes, and not give that back.
Darwin: Hmmm...
Momnapped!
[We cut to the Watterson residence]
Gumball: You stole his mom?!
[We cut to Gumball and Darwin's bedroom. It seems that Darwin kidnapped Jackie Wilson, tied her up in a chair, put headphones on her head so she won't be able to hear, and gagged her]
Darwin: What? You said to take something he likes!
Gumball: Something, not someone! Have you gone totally nuts?!
Darwin: Uhh...did I go too far?
Gumball: Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask our new house guest?! Do you think he's gone too far? Oh, right. She can't answer, BECAUSE YOU TIED HER UP, YOU PSYCHO!
Darwin: Look, it's not that bad. Tobias will know where she is as soon as he gets home and reads the note I left.
Gumball: Okay, you know what? I'm out.
Darwin: Uh...The thing is, I kinda signed the note from both us, with you being my sidekick and all...
Gumball: Uh... [Gumball quietly sighs angrily] We're taking this poor mom back home before anyone notices she's missing.
Darwin: Hey! I'm the one in charge! We do what I say, and I say we do what you just said!
[We cut to outside. Gumball and Darwin are struggling wheeling Jackie back to her home]
Gumball: I can't believe this! Do you realize that this is a living, breathing mom that you stole? Poor thing! Oh...We should take the back-road so that we won't be seen by anyone.
Darwin: Wait. Since when does the sidekick give the orders?
Gumball: Since the leader turned into a mom-napper!
Darwin: Oh, so I make one little mistake during my first day on the job, and you decide I'm a criminal!
Gumball: I didn't decide that! Society did! Now, I'm making an executive decision and taking charge!
Darwin: You don't have the authority!
[Jackie slowly wheels down the sidewalk, and she speeds up gradually saying something but is muffled. Gumball and Darwin don't notice]
Jackie​​​​​​: [Mumbling]
Gumball: That's it! I am taking your leader badge away! [Gumball "takes" Darwin's "leader badge."]
Darwin: You never gave me a badge!
Gumball: It's an invisible badge!
[Darwin draws an invisible sword]
Darwin: You better give that back!
Gumball: What's that?
Darwin: It's my invisible sword. Don't think I won't invisibly use it!
Gumball: Well, try getting past my invisible bazooka!
[Jackie slides down the sidewalk, faster, and faster. She can be heard mumbling and screaming]
Darwin: Well, I'm coming for you in my invisible tank!
Gumball: Invisible army, fire!
Darwin: Don't make me use my invisible nuke!
Gumball: No! Fool! You'll wipe us both out!
Darwin: Okay, okay. Truce. Let's just work together. Wait a minute...
[Jackie is seen sliding down the sidewalk again, screaming profusely. There are tons of cars passing by on the road, and she's getting pretty close to it. Gumball and Darwin run to the rescue!]
Darwin: Aw, man! She's going to get creamed, and it's all my fault! I never should have done this!
Gumball: You're just realizing that now?
[A huge track is on the road. Jackie is approaching it. Gumball grabs a nearby rock, and he throws it on a switch underneath the chair, causing the chair to lower Jackie. She passes underneath the truck without a scratch, gets lifted in the air, and safely lands in a bush]
Gumball: [Gumball sighs] Okay, that didn't work. Let's take the shortcut through Main Street!
Darwin: But, there's hundreds of people! We'd have to be invisible!
Gumball: I've got an idea.
[Gumball and Darwin draw a "face" on Jackie's blindfold and her duct-taped mouth. They pass through the street, acting as if they are beggars]
Gumball: People, please give generously to the cause of this poor woman! Open your wallets as wide as your hearts! It's for a good cause!
Darwin: I feel so conflicted. I'm glad this is working, but I'm really disappointed in mankind right now.
Mister Small​​​​​​: Hold on! I've got change for you!
Gumball: Just ignore him and walk faster. Come on people! Don't be greedy, give to the needy!
Mister Small​​​​​​: Stop! Here, here! I've got money! Wait, please! Take it!
Darwin: [Suddenly, Darwin stops] This man's giving out free money!
[Then, Mr. Small gets squashed by a frantic Gary, Martin, and Pantsbully]
Darwin: Well, that was easier than expected. Okay, so Tobias' house is just around the corner, right past that...
[Gumball and Darwin suddenly gasp]
Darwin: ...police car.
[They then lower the chair again, and they try to get past the Doughnut Sheriff]
Donut Sheriff: Ah! Thought you could hide right under my nose, did ya? Surrender yourselves!
Darwin: What do we do? What do we do?!
Gumball: There's no way out! We're going to prison, buddy.
Donut Sheriff: Come out! You're under arrest! [He starts grunting. It's revealed that he was actually talking to a peanut he dropped under his car seat] Come out, little peanut! The long arm of the law is comin' for ya!
[Gumball and Darwin then continue their quest]
Donut Sheriff: You have the right to remain silent...and delicious! [He then eats the peanut]
Tobias' House
Gumball: Ugh, this mom-napping thing was by far the worst leader move I've ever heard of!
Darwin: Oh come on! That's exactly the kind of idea you'd usually come up with!
Gumball: Yeah, but if it was my plan, I would have had you stop me from doing it!
Darwin: What do you mean?
Gumball: I mean, you're not a sidekick, dude. You're a guardian! I need you, man!
Darwin: [Darwin sheds a tear] I...I never thought of it like that. [The boys then sob, hug, and make up] Can we go back to the way it was before?
Gumball: Sure we can. Just as soon as we return the mother you stole.
Darwin: [Darwin checks Tobias' mailbox and takes out a piece of paper] Yes! The note's still here!
[Suddenly, the Wilsons' house door opens. It's Tobias! The boys think fast, and kick Jackie in a nearby bush before Tobias notices]
Tobias​​​​​: Oh, hey, guys! Did you come for the game? Sorry, my mom cleaned my room. Only she knows where it is, and I can't find her anywhere!
[The boys then stare at Jackie struggling in the bush, then at a smiling Tobias, then they make their final decision]
Gumball: You know what? Just keep it.
[The episode ends]
