Horrible Mother
[Nicole is sleeping in her bed. Suddenly, an eerie shadow comes, and it turns out to be Anais. Nicole is shocked when she sees her]
Nicole: Aah!
Anais: [Holds up poster] It's Daisy the Donkey on Ice Day! You promised to take me, and we're late!
Nicole: Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Mommy worked really late last night.
[Anais holds a tape recorder and plays it]
Nicole: [On recording] What sort of a horrible mother wouldn't take her daughter to her favorite show?
Nicole: Oh, Anais, I know what I said, but—
[Anais replays the part that says "horrible mother" on repeat]
Nicole: [Sighs] Okay.
What Could Go Wrong?
[The living room. Richard opens up a box]
Richard: "ElectroFat. Gets you fit while you watch TV." [Puts the ElectroFat electrodes on his body] So the last electrode goes... Where? Oh, there!
[Nicole and Anais go down the stairs, with Anais dragging Nicole while jumping and singing]
Anais: Daisy the Donkey, Daisy!
Richard: Oh, hi, Honey!
Nicole: [Yawns] Hi. Where's Gumball and Darwin?
Richard: In the backyard, playing their made-up game.
Nicole: Keep an eye on them. Every time they play that game, it's a mess.
[Flashback to when they played the game, the house was a mess]
Gumball and Darwin: Dodge or Dare!
[Flashback ends]
Richard: Relax, honey. I'm here. What could go wrong?
[Flashback to when Richard played with them, the house was on fire]
Gumball, Darwin and Richard: Dodge or Dare! Dodge or Dare! Dodge or Dare!
[Flashback ends]
Nicole: [Nervously] Yeah... What could go wrong?
Anais: [Frustrated] Daisy the Donkey!
[Nicole is pulled out of the house by Anais]
Richard: Now come on, ElectroFat. Make me beautiful! [Turns on the switch and he screams]
Dodge or Dare
[The backyard. Gumball and Darwin are playing Dodge or Dare. Richard's screaming is heard]
Darwin: What was that?
Gumball: Doesn't matter. It's time to play...
Darwin and Gumball: Dodge or Dare! Roll the dice, take a card! [Takes out a card]
Darwin: Dare! You have to throw the ball onto the moon using only objects from the trash!
Gumball: [Stretches his arms] Ha! Just watch and learn. [Quickly builds a Rube-Goldberg machine] Yes! [Blows out a marble]
[The marble moves through the machine and eventually makes a bowling ball fly to Gumball's direction]
Gumball: Aaaahh! [Covers his face with his hands as the ball is about to hit his face]
[The ball's movement is suddenly paused]
Darwin: Hey, the card says "No hands".
[Gumball sighs and hardens his face to receive the ball. The ball suddenly moves again and bounces back from his face]
[Cut to the Robinsons' backyard. The Robinsons are seated on lawn lounge chairs]
Gaylord: I told you, Margaret. It's not a mid-life crisis. It's just a new car.
[The ball suddenly hits Margaret's wig, causing it to fall off]
Gumball: Huh, it landed on the Mr. Robinson's yard!
[Gumball and Darwin scream in excitement and take a peek at the Robinson's backyard. Gaylord Robinson is seen laughing at his wife]
Gumball: Mr. Robinson, he's such a funny guy!
Darwin: Mrs. Robinson is one lucky lady!
[Margaret puts her wig back on, glares at Gaylord and he stops laughing. They hear the doorbell ringing]
[Cut to the front door. It opens and Gumball and Darwin are happily talking simultaneously]
Gaylord: [Interrupting] Your ball fell into my garden, causing my wife's hair... To fall off! Therefore, as a punishment, I'll teach you a new game called... Emm...
[Margaret whispers something]
Gaylord: Learning the consequences of your actions!
Gumball: A game Mr. Robinson invented for us?
Gumball and Darwin: Yay!
The Punishment
[Cut to the Robinsons' backyard]
Gaylord: You can start by cleaning the garden.
Gumball and Darwin: Yes!
Gaylord: But wait! [Kicks the tree to make all of the leaves fall down] There you go. You wouldn't want it to be easy, would ya? [Laughs as he and Margaret go back into the house]
Gumball and Darwin: Wohoo! [Jump in the pile of leaves]
[A few hours later]
Gaylord: We'll see if they're still smiling after this. [Laughs with his wife]
[The doorbell rings and the Robinsons immediately go to open it. They then stare dumbfounded at what they're seeing]
Gumball: Excuse me. [Takes a leaf from Gaylord's head] There. [Puts the leaf into a group of other leaves] We're done! This is green, greeny-orange, orangey-green, terracotta, Egyptian sunrise, sunset yellow, and this... [Shows them a leaf that has Mr. Robinson's face] ...is the Mr. Robinson head-shaped leaf.
Gumball and Darwin: [Amazed] Ooooooooh! Can we keep it?
Gaylord: No. [Checks grass] You slackers forgot to cut the grass!
Gumball: Oh, Mr. Robinson, you're so right!
Darwin: [Punches his own head] What were we thinking?!
Gumball: We'll get it right on it! [Cheers with hands up]
Gaylord: But wait! [Hands out his nail clippers] You got to use nail clippers.
Gumball and Darwin: Yay! Thank you, Mr. Robinson! [Both run in excitement back in the backyard]
Gaylord: I think they're missing the point.
[Gaylord and Margaret face to the door to go back inside]
Gumball and Darwin: [Off-screen] Done!
Gaylord: WHAT THE—?!
[The backyard is shown to be very tidy and sparkly]
The Sun: Oh!
Gaylord: All right, goons. [Carries a paint can and a brush] Come here and, paint this fence blue.
Gumball and Darwin: Yay! [Run in excitement to back in the backyard]
Gaylord: That'll teach them to mess with Gaylord Robinson.
Gumball and Darwin: DONE!
Gaylord: Hmph! Now Make it green!
Gumball and Darwin: DONE!
Gaylord: [Off-screen] Orange with purple stripes!
Gumball and Darwin: DONE!
Gaylord: [Off-screen] Yellow with black dots!
Gumball and Darwin: DONE!
Gaylord: [Off-screen] Pink!
Gumball and Darwin: DONE!
Gaylord: [Off-screen] Red!
Gumball and Darwin: DONE!
Gaylord: [Off-screen] Blue!
Gumball and Darwin: DONE!
Gaylord: [Off-screen] Black!
Gumball and Darwin: DONE!
Gaylord: [Off-screen] YELLOW!
Gumball and Darwin: DONE!
Gaylord: AAAARRGGGHHH!!!
Darwin: Mr. Robinson, since you love painting so much, I made this bird especially for you. [Shows his drawing and gives it to Mr. Robinson]
Gaylord: [Receives Darwin's painting, confused] Uh, thanks?
[Margaret whispers to him]
Gaylord: Oh, yeah! [Throws away Darwin's painting] Follow me!
More Punishment
[Cut to the Robinsons' living room]
Gaylord: Now, there is a stain on this rug.
Gumball: Where?
Gaylord: [Throws juice in a glass onto the rug] THERE!
[Gaylord and Margaret laugh as if they have done something evil, but stops after looking at the rug, confused]
Gaylord: HUH?!
[The rug is still clean as the juice stain never landed onto it]
Gaylord: I mean, THERE! [Throws more juice onto the rug]
[The rug stays clean]
Gaylord: WHAT?! [Holds a glass of juice, confused] HUH?!
Gumball and Darwin: More ice, sir? [Carries a bucket of ice cubes]
Gaylord: AARGH! GIMME THAT! [Grabs the jug from Margaret and angrily throws its juice onto the rug]
[In a slow-motion scene, Gumball quickly drinks the juice, keeping the rug clean. Darwin then cleans his mouth with a napkin]
Gaylord: HUH?! [Looks at the jug in confusion] WHAT?! [Looks at the glass in confusion] Okay, now you're scaring me.
Unnecessary Help
[Cut to in front of the Robinsons' house. Gaylord sends Gumball and Darwin out of the house and slams the door]
Gumball: I'm sure Mr. Robinson needs more help.
Darwin: Maybe he's too shy to ask.
Gaylord: [Camera zooms to the mail chute] GO AWAY!
Gumball: He hides it well, but, I can feel he needs us.
Gaylord: [From left lower window] GO AWAY! [From right upper window] GO AWAY! [From left upper window] GO AWAAAAY!
Gumball: Now, that is a cry for help. [Points above him]
[Back to the Robinsons' living room]
Gaylord: [Reads newspaper] Those little parasites, they just won't -- [Someone clips his nails]
Gumball: [Stops clipping Gaylord's toenails] Oh, hi, Mr. Robinson!
Gaylord: WHAT?! [Angrily] DON'T TOUCH ME!
[Cut to outside, then quickly cut back to the Robinsons' living room]
Gaylord: [Annoyed] Unbelievable.
[Gumball starts poking Gaylord's face with a fork with a lump of food on it as he tries to feed him, then camera zooms out to reveal Gumball and Darwin with a plate of food]
Gumball: Come on, eat up, Mr. Robinson.
Gaylord: [Angrily] GET AWAY FROM ME!
[Cut to outside, then quickly cut to the Robinsons' bathroom]
Gaylord: [Annoyed] Darn those kids! Can a guy get some privacy in his own house? [Tries to get some toilet paper, but realizes it has ran out] Blasted, out of paper.
[Suddenly, Gumball's hand appears, holding a pink toilet paper roll as he wants to give it to Gaylord] [Angrily]
Gaylord: GET OUTTA HERE!!! [Throws the toilet paper. The toilet paper hits Darwin's head]
[Brief pause]
Gaylord: Oh, wait! Could you throw that back please?
[Cut to the Robinsons' bedroom, with Gaylord lying down in his bed]
Gaylord: [Groans] I need to lay down.
[Gumball and Darwin suddenly rise near the bed]
Gumball and Darwin: It's bed time, Mr. Robinson! [Puts on a baby bonnet on Gaylord]
[Gaylord fumes his anger, heating his head]
Darwin: Oh... [Puts his hands to Mr. Robinson skin to indicate if he has a fever] I think he has a temperature.
Gumball: Come on Mr. Robinson! [Hands a thermometer to Gaylord] Say AH!
Gaylord: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
[The house literally shakes]
Car Wash
[Cut to the Robinsons' living room]
Gaylord: [Groans] Listen, kids, why are you trying so hard to help me?
Gumball and Darwin: [With sparkling eyes] Because we love you, Mr. Robinson.
Gaylord: But there's nothing left for you to do!
Gumball and Darwin: We could clean your new car.
Gaylord: Uh, NO WAY! My car is brand new AND very expensive!
Gumball and Darwin: We could clean Mrs. Robinson.
[Margaret appears behind Gaylord, indicating she doesn't want to be cleaned by them]
Gaylord: Alright... clean the car.
Gumball and Darwin: YAY! [Run in excitement to the door to start their task]
Gaylord: Bu-bu-bu-bu-but please be careful with it!
[Gumball and Darwin are outside the Robinsons' house, starting to clean the car]
Gumball: So... where do we start?
Darwin: I don't know. I never cleaned a car before.
Gumball: Doesn't matter! [Squeezes Darwin's cheeks] Let's make Mr. Robinson proud!
Darwin: Okay.
[Gumball starts to gently touch the car with a sponge]
Darwin: Easy. Mr. Robinson said it's very expensive.
Gumball: I know. I'll just...
[The sponge touches the car by a centimeter. The car collapses]
Gumball: At least things can't get any worse.
[The car's wreckage bursts into flames, Gumball and Darwin scream]
[Cut to the backyard with Gaylord and Margaret sitting, and the smoke coming from the car is seen behind]
Gaylord: You know, Margaret? Maybe those kids aren't so bad after all.
[Cut back to the trouble scene]
Gumball: [Panicked] What are we gonna do?!
Darwin: I don't know. I never burned a car before.
Gumball: This is terrible!
Darwin: We failed him!
Gumball: Ohh, the shame!
Darwin: Can't ever show our faces again! [Squeezes his cheeks in panic]
Gumball: We need to hide away forever!
[Darwin cries]
Hide!
[Cut to the Wattersons' attic]
Gumball: Ooh, dark.
Darwin: [Cleans half of the dust] Filthy.
Gumball: Horrible.
Gumball and Darwin: Perfect.
[Gaylord and Margaret walk to the front yard and see their car is destroyed]
Gaylord: [Shocked] My car! [Gets down on his knees in despair] Who... did... THIS?!
[Margaret whispers]
Gaylord: Those kids! I'M GONNA GET THEM FOR THIS!
[Cut to inside the attic with Gumball and Darwin]
Gaylord: [From outside] COME OUT! I'M CALLING THE SHERIFF!
Gumball: [Whispering] Oh, no! They know we wrecked the car.
[A silhouette appears behind them, and it turns out to be Richard]
Richard: [Whispering] What do you mean you wrecked the car?
[Gumball and Darwin scream as they see Richard behind them. Their scream causes the screen to shake]
Gumball: Dad?
Richard: Hi.
Someone's Back
[Cut to the Watterson's car, with Anais and Nicole, coming home from Daisy the Donkey on Ice. Anais is holding a giant Daisy plushie]
Anais: [Singing] Daisy! Daisy the Donkey! Mom, why the Robinsons talking to the Sheriff on the lawn?
Nicole: [Nervously] I don't know, sweetie.
[Nicole pushes Anais downwards as she ducks out of sight]
Nicole: [Whispering] I think we'll just go around the back.
[Cut to the front of the Robinsons' house, with Gaylord, Margaret, and Doughnut Sheriff]
Gaylord: I'm telling you, Sheriff! It was those kids next door as sure as I...
[Gaylord is interrupted by a car passing by, with a view of a Daisy doll in the driver seat]
Gaylord: What?
[Cut back to the attic]
Gumball: [Sadly] We just touched it with a sponge and it fell apart! So we decided to hide here forever.
Richard: [Sniffs] Such a sad story! [His eyes sparkles as he feels sad, then quickly turns back to normal and starts telling them what really happened] But it's not true! You see, it was 9 o'clock this morning, and... [Imitates a sound effect as he starts a flashback]
[Flashback to earlier morning]
Richard: ...come on ElectroFat. Make me beautiful!
[Richard turns on the switch and screams in pain, spazzing out while moving his arms like a robot. He then manages to take off the ElectroFat electrodes]
Richard: ENOUGH... BEAUTY!
[The ElectroFat gets thrown out of the window and hits the Robinsons' car. Richard then walks out of the house and approaches the car]
Richard: Oh, Mr. Robinson's new car.
[Camera zooms in to show a dink in the car]
Richard: Oh, okay. It's just a dink. I'll bang it out. [Pulls out a hammer and bangs the car, only to cause another large dink] This may take a while.
[Sometime later]
Richard: There...
[Camera zooms out to the car]
Richard: Finished!
[The car breaks down immediately]
Richard: AAAAHH!
[Richard tries to fix the car in a quick movement, then exhales as he finishes, and runs away in horror. Flashback ends]
Richard: [Makes the sound effect noises again] So you see, it was my fault, not yours.
Gumball: What should we do now?
Richard: Well, I think the most responsible thing to do is to hide here forever. [Whispering] And never let your mother find out what happened.
[Anais and Nicole suddenly appear behind them]
Nicole: [Whispering] I already know.
[The three scream as they see Anais and Nicole.Their scream causes the screen to shake like before]
Richard: Honey?
Nicole: But it's not quite what you think. It was 9 o'clock this morning—
Richard: [Interrupts Nicole] Wait! Can I do this? [Imitates a sound effect again to start another flashback]
[Flashback to earlier morning]
Anais: Daisy! Put the tape on, Mom!
Nicole: Yes, honey. [Ducks to find the tape] Where is it? [Finds the tape] Here!
Anais: Yeah! [Cheers]
[Suddenly, the car hits the Robinsons' car, destroying its headlights and shocking them]
Nicole: [Voice-over] They parked right in front of our lawn. I just didn't see it. I was about to tell Mr. Robinson, but—
[Cut to Anais playing the recorder and replaying the part that says "horrible mother". Nicole sighs, and decides to go anyway]
Nicole: [Voice-over] So, we went to see the show.
[They leave in the car. Flashback ends]
Anais: And it was GREAT!
Nicole: So there. It was mostly my fault. [Looks down]
Richard: I'm so relieved. It was a family effort.
Gaylord: [From outside] DARN IT! I KNOW THEY'RE UP THERE! [Cut to outside] GET IN THERE AND ARREST THOSE VANDALS!
Donut Sheriff: Ah, not without a warrant, sir.
Gaylord: [Angrily screams] I PAY MY TAXES, AND THAT PAYS YOUR SALARY! ERGO... [Pokes Sheriff in annoyance] I'M! YOUR! BOSS! NOW, GET IN THERE, AND DO YOUR JOB!
Donut Sheriff: Please, sir! Calm down!
Gaylord: All right. [Faces to Margaret] I suppose I shall have to take matters into my own hands, huh?! Well...
[Background changes to flames, with Margaret holding a duster and Gaylord holding a golf club]
Gaylord: Here come the Robinsons.
Gumball: [Looks from the attic window] Poor Mr. Robinson. We wrecked his beautiful new car [Cut to inside the attic] and nobody has the courtesy to apologize.
Darwin: We should be ashamed of ourselves!
Gumball: So, let's get out there and apologize.
[Gumball and Darwin's eyes sparkle]
Gumball: As a family.
Anais, Nicole and Richard: [Sigh] Okay...
Bad Neighbors
[The family step outside, and they are shocked]
Nicole and Richard: [Gasp]
Gaylord: THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU MESS WITH GAYLORD! [He and Margaret start destroying Richard's car] THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS! THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS! THIS... IS... WHAT... HAPPENS!
Richard: They look kind of angry, Gumball.
Donut Sheriff: Please, stop! Please!
[Margaret turns around, hissing, as she is about to assault the Doughnut Sheriff with the duster, making him more nervous]
Donut Sheriff: Please, ma'am. Drop the duster! Please! No, ma'am! [Pulls out his taser] NO! [Zaps Margaret] NO!
[Margaret falls down, The Doughnut Sheriff realizes his mistake, and Gaylord slowly turns his head to see Margaret, assuming she is dead]
Gaylord: [In slow-motion] MARGARET!
Donut Sheriff: No, sir! No, please!
[Gaylord angrily jumps over the Doughnut Sheriff, ready to attack him with the golf club, then camera cuts to the electrified Gaylord and Margaret]
Nicole: Maybe we should give them time to calm down.
[Cut to Gaylord and Margaret sitting in the police car, angrily yelling at the Wattersons]
Donut Sheriff: So, uh, do you wanna press charges?
[Scene changes to the Wattersons. Nicole is now smiling nervously]
Richard: [Laughs nervously] No. I'm sure they learned their lesson.
[Cut back to the police car]
Donut Sheriff: It's too bad you have to live next to such monsters. [Gets into the police car]
Gumball: Don't worry, Mr. Robinson. We'll look out for your house while you're gone.
[Gaylord and Margaret angrily yell at Gumball and Darwin as the police car leaves]
Gumball and Darwin: Such a great guy.
Richard: Well, there is one important thing we learned today.
Gumball, Darwin, Anais, and Nicole: Huh?
Richard: That ElectroFat Machine was worth [Takes off his shirt, revealing his abs] every penny.
[Richard flexes his abs and the episode ends]
