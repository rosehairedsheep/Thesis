Just Notice Us
[Gumball and Darwin eat in silence]
Gumball: So, what's going on today?
Darwin: Nothing much, really.
[The Green Bear, who is behind them, slams the table, and sings "Just Notice Us"]
Green bear: [Singing] Finally! Is it my turn? Is it my time to leap from the background, and shine! [Dances] I've been quiet for way too long. I can say whatever I want to now. There is nothing to stop you from listening. Hey there! I'm talking to you! I've been behind you all along! But this is my chance [Hugs Gumball and Darwin] to stand in the spotlight and shine. And breathe! And sing! And dance! [Grabs Gumball by collar] Just notice me!
All the extras: You have ignored us, for way too long. Do you think that's really fair? There's stuff that happens to us as well when you're looking elsewhere! So stop being blind. [Surround Gumball and Darwin] This is our time. It's your turn to stand behind. Don't make a fuss! This one's about us! Just notice uuuusssss!
Gumball: ...Okay.
At the Stadium
[Flashback to the events of "The Sweaters," back at Richwood High]
Darwin: This is boring, bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-boring, bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-boring.​..
[One of the cardboard-like human spectators goes to his friend amongst the crowd]
Human 1: Hey, dude, I got your popcorn.
[He attempts to give it to his friend, but his stiff arms instead make it fall down]
Human 2: Oh, thanks, man! Do you have my change?
Human 1: Yeah. It's just here in my pocket. Help yourself.
[The other cardboard-like spectator tries to reach into his friend's pocket. But he can't move his arms which are raised upwards]
Human 2: Whatever, man. Just keep it.
Human 1: Cool!
Human 2: Aw, man, I'm thirsty.
[The first spectator hands a drink, only to spill it. His friend sighs]
Human 1: You want another?
Human 2: Yeah.
Human 1: Sorry. [Moves away] Excuse me.
Hospital
Hamburger Cop: So what's wrong with me, doctor?
Bandage Doctor: Well, your cholesterol is way too high. I recommend you become a veggie Burger.
[A rim shot sound effect plays. The doctor sees one of his patients, a drum kit, sneeze.]
Bandage Doctor: I'll be with you in a minute, sir.
In the Streets
[Ed, the Black Pentagon, and the Black Rectangle walk to the bus stop. Ed sees the bus stop sign, and makes a sing-song intonation noise equivalent to him saying "hi" to it. The bus stop does not respond. This angers Ed, and he rages at it until he hits the sign. The triangle's family recognize it as a bus stop sign, and not a shape person.]
Black Rectangle: Ed, it's a bus stop.
Construction Men
George: [Drinks] So, you heard about Steve?
Hank: Yeah, I know. Apparently, he paid a fortune for it. But it's supposed to look just like the real thing.
George: Wait wait! He's coming. Don't mention it. Just act cool.
Steve [Off-screen] Hey, guys!
[Gray Construction Man is surprised. Steve comes in with a wig]
Steve: [Walks to them] What's going on?
Hank: Hey, Steve. Nothing much. We're just hanging hair-HERE! Hey, it's good to see your rug-MUG! Mug-mug-mug. But anyway, how it's going toupee-TODAY? Today.
[He pretends not to see Steve's hair. Eventually, he just stares at him]
Steve: [Laughs] All right, I know you know. So, what do you think?
George: [Screaming] YOUR HAIR IS HORRIBLE!
Steve: Oh come on, give me a break. Hank, what do you think?
[Hank continues staring silently]
George: [Screaming again] IT LOOKS LIKE A WAX TURBAN! IT LOOKS LIKE A STRAWBERRY MOP! IT LOOKS LIKE A PINK FONDUE!
Steve: [Mad] You guys are real jerks, you know that?
Hank: Aw, come on Steve. No need to wig out.
Steve: [Insulted] Ugh! Gentlemen, goodbye!
[With his eyes closed, he turns back. But his wig does not, and covers his closed eyes. Steve walks away, but falls down a ditch]
George: But it suits you!
Eggs and Bacon
[The Exercise Bacon walks along the street]
Exercise Bacon: Bacon man. I'm made of bacon! I'm the only one who can commit to vegetarian. To bacon! 'Cause I'm made of bacon! I'm the bacon man! And-
[He bumps into both Colin and Felix, cracking them open. The result is an eggs and bacon frowning face. The drum kit guy passes by, and sneezes]
Back at the Stadium
Human 1: [Moves through crowd] Sorry. Sorry. Me again, coming through. Hey dude! Here's your popcorn.
Human 2: Can you give it to me, slowly this time please?
Human 1: Sure.
[He hands the popcorn to the other spectator slowly. The popcorn falls again, but much slowly]
Human 2: [Sighs]
Human 1: Yeah. Sorry. Let me pick it up.
Human 2: No no no. I can do this.
[He struggles to bend over many times. Then he snaps himself, and flips upside down]
Human 2: AH!
Human 1: Dude! Are you alright?
Human 2: Yeah, everything's cool.
Birds
[A pigeon lands on the Watterson's house's chimney. Then a colorful bird lands in front of it]
Colorful Bird: [Chirps] (Translation: Hey girl, wanna dance? Because I've got moves).
[He dances until the other bird stops]
Pigeon: [Chirps] (Translation: Dude, you do realize I'm a guy right?)
Colorful Bird: [Dismayed]
Pigeon: [Chirps] (Translation: But keep going, that was awesome! )
[The colorful bird continues dancing]
Mother-Son Time
[Felicity is driving her car]
Billy: Mother, are we there yet?
Felicity: Uh no. Not yet, sweetie.
Billy: Mother, will we get there soon?
Felicity: Uh yes. Quite soon.
Billy: Mother, are we there yet?
Felicity: Uh no. It'll take a little more time, darling.
Billy: Mother, you will let me know when we're there?
Felicity: Yes, my precious.
[Short moment of silence]
Billy: Mother, are we there now?
Felicity: No. Not yet, darling.
Billy: Mother, I'm bored. Will you not drive faster?
Felicity: Yes, that sounds like a very good idea.
[She drives faster, and crashes into a house]
Billy: Mother! Are we there?
Felicity: [Comes out of house] Yes, sweetheart. Now daddy's going to take care of you while Mommy has a little lie down. [Knocks herself unconscious with a spade]
[Drum kit passes by]
Chanax Incorporated
[In the office…]
Mike: [Drinks]
Lenny: So, Mike. What is it you do here?
Mike: I'm a financial practitioner contractor.
Lenny: Nice. May I ask what that is?
Mike: …I don't know. But I hate it! [Cries]
Lenny: Oh, man! I thought I was the only one who had no idea why he's here!
Charlie: What about me? I came here a year ago to use the men's room, and I never found my way out! [Cries]
Clipboard Man: Wait, guys. What're we doing with our lives?
Lenny: He's right! [Rips necktie off] Why are we sticking around with these nooses around our necks, instead of running in the forest naked! I mean running in the forest period!
Clipboard Man: Yeah, what is there to stop us from living the lives we deserve, huh?
Karen: [Approaches] Hey guys, here's your paychecks.
Clipboard Man: [Receives pay] Oh, yeah. That's why.
Senior Citizen's Moment
[Marvin, Louie, Betty, and Donald are sitting in the lawn where they usually are seen. Then Marvin plays music from a nearby radio with his cane. He starts doing some dance moves, his bones cracking. He motions to Donald who moves his mustache. Betty moves her legs, and stands up slowly]
All: Ooohhh!
[She sits down, and Louie gets up]
All: Ooohhh-
Louie: Ugh, cut it out! I haven't started yet.
[He does some of his own moves, but his bones also creak and crack. Then he kneels, and points to a trashcan]
Louie: You just got served, young man.
Marvin: Louie, that's a trashcan! Did you take your medicine?
Louie: No one asked for your opinion, magic talking fire hydrant!
Back in Richwood High
[A tennis ball is served]
Human 1: Hey dude! The ball's coming my way. What do I do, what do I do!?
Human 2: Catch it.
Human 1: I got it. I got it! I got it-oof! [Get's hit by ball]
[This turns him to his side, and makes him look like he disappeared]
Human 1: Ahh! I vanished! Help me out!
Human 2: Ah! Turn back, man! Turn back.
Human 1: [Turns to side] Oh, dude. I thought I was gone. [Sobs] You saved me, man. Give me a hug.
[They "hug"]
Human 2: It's alright, bro. Everything is alright.
[Their upraised arms get stuck together, and they try pulling themselves apart]
Human 2: Dude, I'm stuck.
[They scream]
Prison Song
[In a jail cell, the Goblin, the Spray Paint Bottle, the Butterknife, and the Dolphin Man start humming a song. One of them snaps to and creates a rhythm. Then a fellow prisoner, the Spray Paint Bottle, plays the harmonica out of tune, solo]
Win or Don't Win
Shooting Star: Now, Gary. Let's see if you win at Win, or Don't Win!
[Gary sweats as the clock ticks]
Shooting Star: And he's won!
Gary: [Roars triumphantly]
Shooting Star: [Laughs]
Gary: [Rips off shirt] [Grabs Shooting Star] THANK YOU! THANK YOU!
Shooting Star: It's okay. It's only a microwave.
Gary: THANK [Hugs Shooting Star wildly] YOU! [Hugs Shooting Star again] [Roars] THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!
[The Shooting Star gets scared, and tries to escape, but is being held by Gary]
Shooting Star: Whoa-ah! No, don't-
Gary: [Kisses Shooting Star, and wrestles with him] THANK YOU!
Shooting Star: Ugh somebody help! Somebody PLEASE-
[The TV show is cut off]
Discovering Moving
[Back at Richwood High…]
Human 1: Aw man, my arms are killing me!
Human 2: Yeah, well there's nothing you can do about that.
Human 1: Wait? Are you sure? I mean we don't know. What if-what if I just-
[He strains to move himself. His face moves, and soon he successfully becomes a non-cardboard-like person]
Human 3: All this time, we were able to move?
Human 4: But nobody had the intelligence, or courage to try.
Human 5: Apart from this free-spirited young man!
Human 6: …He's different!
Human 7: Let's GET him!
[The crowd riots, and the spectator that can now move runs away]
Human 2: Dude, wait! What about me?!
[The moving spectator grabs his friend, and runs away]
Cemetery
[A ghost repeatedly rises, and lies back down in his grave]
Ghost With Hoodie: [Rises] One… [Falls back down] [Rises] Two… [Falls back down]
[Another ghost emerges from its grave]
Ghost With Hoodie: [Rises] Three…
Ghost: What're you doing?
Ghost With Hoodie: I've been working out my gut. [Stands up] What do you think?
[There are nothing but bones in his gut]
Ghost: Wow, it's totally working. You're shredded.
[The drum kit passes by, and sneezes]
The Story of the Pepperonis
[In the bus stop, Siciliana takes out a cloth, but it is blown away by the wind. She bends to pick it up, and sees someone's hand taking it. Quattro then gives it back to her. The cloth now says "Meet me in the park, 2 PM." Siciliana looks up, and sees that Quattro is gone. The scene cuts to her in the park, sitting on a bench. She looks at the time on her watch, and once she looks back up, Quattro is beside her. They come close together, and hold hands. They have fun together, and bike, have a picnic and watch a movie. Then at the end of the day, they kiss. But their pizza heads stick together, and when they separate their heads, their faces are disfigured. Quattro groans, and the animals nearby get scared, scream, and flee from them]
Escape
[The moving spectator is seen driving a car]
Human 1: Oh man, I can't believe I almost left you there.
Human 2: I'm glad you came back. I'm also glad you stole a convertible.
Human 1: Don't worry! I've got your back, bro.
[Human 2 screams as he is blown away by the wind.]
Human 1: I will never leave you behind.
Back to the Cafeteria
All The Extras: So now that you know, we're people like you. And you've seen our lives. The things that we do. Don't leave us behind. Keep us in mind. So now turn around, and notice uuuusssss!
[The drum kit passes by, and sneezes]
Gumball: Turn around?
[He and Darwin turn behind their backs]
Gumball: But there's nobody left back there.
Green bear: Yeah, didn't think about that.
