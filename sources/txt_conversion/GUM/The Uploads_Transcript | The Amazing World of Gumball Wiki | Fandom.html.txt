Getting Sucked Into Elmore Stream
[Gumball is on the computer, about to click a video on Elmore Stream-It]
Darwin: Don't do it!
Gumball: I just need one, man. Just one video. Just let me hit one.
Darwin: No! You'll end up disappearing down the Elmore Stream hole. There's no knowing how many precious hours you'll lose watching idiotic online videos. So back away from the PC.
Gumball: DON'T COME ANY CLOSER! I'LL DO IT! I'LL CLICK!
Darwin: Don't! Just stay calm, take your hands away from the keyboard.
[Gumball whimpers in fear]
Darwin: Now slowly walk away from the computer.
[Gumball does in response]
Darwin: Now turn around. Nice and easy.
[Gumball turns and has the mouse in his hand, then Darwin's pupils contract]
Darwin: Don't! You got too much to live for! You got family, right?
Gumball: [Nods] Uh-huh.
Darwin: You got friends, yeah?
Gumball: [Nods] Uh-huh.
Darwin: You got a girlfriend, too.
[Gumball whimpers and starts crying]
Darwin: Then why waste your life online like this?!
Gumball: [Crying] I've gone too far. It's too late for me. It's too late.
Darwin: It's never too late to choose life...instead of the Internet. Just drop the mouse.
[Gumball starts breathing rapidly]
Darwin: You got too much to live for! Drop the mouse! DROP THE MOUSE! DROP IT! DROP IT NOW! DROP IT!!!
Gumball: [Crying] OKAY, OKAY!
[Gumball drops the mouse]
Darwin: [In Slow-Motion] NOOOOOO!
[Mouse falls clicking on the left mouse button, clicking a video. The computer pulls Gumball and Darwin to it]
Darwin: Well, I guess one's okay.
Gumball: "William Exam Fail."
"William's Exam Fail"
[Video starts playing]
Jamie: [Whispering] Ha! Check this out.
Lucy Simian: You can turn over your test paper now.
[William struggles to turn over his test. He pushes his test to one side of his desk, then to the other and to the other side again. William does this six more times. William then flutter his wings at the paper from above, then a little lower. Then he flutters from the side of the desk. Then the other. William sheds a single tear and sticks himself to the paper. He flips the paper over and slides it onto the desk from the side]
Teri: Oh, sorry, William. Here.
[Teri flips his paper back over. William gets angry and causes an explosion in the classroom, breaking Jamie's camera. The video ends]
Darwin: Okay, just one more.
"Makeup Tips"
[Another video plays]
Sussie: DAH, hello! Today I'll show you how to get rid of those pesky blemishes. DAH! First, you need a little foundation. [Sussie squirts and spreads foundation all over her face] AAAAAH! Good. Now detract from the blemishes, accent your eyes. [Sussie begins drawing normal eyebrows with eyeliner, but the scene cuts to her with giant eyebrows] AAAAAH! Now, as a distraction from your big eyebrows, big eyes! [Sussie removes her eyes and replaces them with bigger google eyes that cover her eyebrows and laughs afterwards] Finishing touch -- Lipstick! [Sussie uses an excessive amount of lipstick around her lips. The scene cuts to Sussie in the form of a real woman] So, there it is, guys. Makeup can fix everything. But remember that real beauty lies within. AAAAAH! [The video ends and cuts back to Elmore Stream-It while Gumball and Darwin are laughing. The next video begins]
"Alan's Ice Bucket"
Alan​​​​: [Laughs] I was nominated by my friend Gumball for the Ice Bucket Challenge. To be on -- [Bobert blares an alarm]
Bobert: COMMUNICATION ERROR: You are not friends with Gumball.
Alan​​​​: [Chuckles nervously] To be honest, I think it's better to just give to the cause without doing the challenge, but -- [Bobert blares another alarm]
Bobert: LOGIC ERROR: Why are you doing it then?
Alan​​​​: What's the harm in having a little fun while helping others? Anyway, the knowledge that I'm doing my bit for those less fortunate than me will keep me warm. [Bobert blares yet another alarm]
Bobert: NEGATIVE -- [Alan glares at Bobert] Altruistic aid of others will provide zero insulation.
Alan​​​​: Okay, you know, Bobert, sometimes you can be a little too literal, you know? Just pour the ice bucket, please?
[Bobert proceeds to pour the ice bucket]
Alan​​​​: I nominate Tobias, Darwin, and -- [Bobert pours the ice bucket on Alan, but it is solid ice and pops Alan before he can finish. Gumball and Darwin replay the part in which Alan pops, starting when he says "Tobias," then again when he says "Darwin." They rewind to this three more times, then once more in slow-motion]
Darwin: Oh, hey! What about "Game Review"?
"Infiniternity"
[An advertisement begins starting from a man's back]
Man: Every journey is a circle turning in squares. [Gumball and Darwin attempt to skip the advertisement, but it doesn't work. The video cuts to the man stroking his hand] But you can't square the circle. [The video cuts to the man's face at an angle] You can only run. [Gumball and Darwin click the man's right eye, which actually blinks when they click it. Then they press his lower lip and his left cheek. The camera cuts to the back of his right side. Gumball and Darwin click around his armpit three times] Run back to you, back to me, back to us. [The video cuts to his upper-body. They click his chest eight times. The video cuts to the back of his head] Outside of everything. Inside of Nothing. [They click the back of the man's head four times. The camera cuts to the left side of his head. They click it seven times. The camera cuts to his face. Gumball and Darwin randomly click his face eighteen times] Infiniternity by -- [The time before the video starts reaches two seconds] All right, all right! You can skip now! Man! [Gumball and Darwin click the skip button]
Calculator Game Review
[The video cuts to the video "Game Review" that Gumball and Darwin intended to watch]
Richard: Okay, hi. This week, I'm reviewing this game I found was part of my computer. It's not as good as Minesweeper or Solitaire, but it's worth a shot. Okay, so, I'm just loading up the game now. [Richard opens the start menu and opens a program while drinking a soda] Okay, it's called "Cal-cu-la-tor." Um, you take a character, and you pick up a pair of binoculars, and you spot the treasure marked by the "X," obviously. [Chuckles] But be careful because as soon as you get the treasure, there's this snake thing. But it's okay 'cause you can pick up the ax, or the bow, or the arrow and kill it and see what you got. [Richard inputs 18 X 59 into the calculator and gets 1,062, which he interprets as his score] Hey, I got a new high score! One criticism I have is that there's no female characters, but there's no male characters, either, so it's okay, I guess. Um, there's a couple of little glitches with certain commands, like if I try to use the arrow with the balloon, see what happens? [Richard divides by 0, which causes his computer to explode] So, yeah, pretty good game. Eight out of ten. Would play again. [Richard's face slams into the desk due to collapsing from the explosion. The video ends]
Gumball: Ah, ah, "Gorilla vs Killer Whale!"
[Gumball and Darwin click the video. "Saxophone Chihuahua" plays instead]
Gumball: [Groans] Trolled. [Gumball and Darwin click another video]
"TobiasX-TremePrank"
Tobias​​​​: Hey, this is Tobias Wilson, and this prank is called "The Rise and Shine." [Tobias imitates an electric guitar] Yeah! Okay, it's five A.M., and my dad is about to get up for work. But I put a skateboard at the bottom of the stairs. Shh! Let's see what happens.
[Harold walks down the stairs and trips and falls on the skateboard, waking up Jackie in the process. Harold sees Tobias and immediately thinks he is being robbed]
Tobias​​​: What the...?
Harold​​​​: Aah! Honey! We're being robbed!
[Jackie screams and at the same time an alarm starts blaring. Harold calls the police while Jackie throws objects at Tobias]
Harold​​​​: Hello, police! We have an intruder! Yes! He's probably armed and dangerous, and he's wearing a rap-music hat.
Tobias​​​​: Guys, guys, it's me! This is a prank. You just got Tobias'd. [Harold hangs up the phone as the alarm stops]
Harold​​​​: Of course! Well, that makes this terrible ordeal funny all of a sudden. [Harold and Jackie laugh] I thought my family was in mortal danger, but it wasn't. [Tobias starts laughing alongside Harold and Jackie] You're grounded.
Tobias​​​​: [Sighs] This is extreme pranking with Tobias Wil-- AAH! [The Doughnut Sheriff busts the door down and tackles Tobias while sirens go off outside. The video ends. Gumball and Darwin give the video 5 likes]
Gumball: Wha...? "The Amazing World of Gumball - Movie Trailer?"
Darwin: Click it.
[Gumball does in response. The video begins with a blue screen showing "the following trailer has been authorized for all audiences by the Feature Film Association of Elmore." Immediately after, "Saxophone Chihuahua" starts playing again. Gumball groans]
"A Little Moment of Calm"
[Another video plays, beginning with the title, a view of the sky and a sitar strumming. The video transitions to Mr. Small, sitting in a grassy field with a boombox and a CD]
Mister Small​​: Welcome to "A Little Moment of Calm," with me -- Mr. Small. Oh I really should have called this "Small Moment of Calm." Anyway, un-clench your chakras, and I'll demonstrate using my new CD, now available in gas stations and supermarkets...in the bargain bin. [Mr. Small plays the CD already in the boombox and begins to meditate]
Mister Small​​: [Through CD] Open your chest and relax. Breathe in. Breathe out. [Mr. Small does in response in real life] Breathe in. Breathe out. [The CD gets stuck] B-b-breathe out. [Mr. Small continues to do as instructed. The CD repeats this ten times, Mr. Small still doing as instructed. As he does this, his body proceeds to invert inside out. The CD finally begins to play after his body is completely inside out] E-e-enjoy your new body. After all, yoga is a form of rebirth. Namaste. [Mr. Small collapses. The video ends and the screen cuts back to Elmore Stream-It]
Gumball: I'll need to bleach my eyeballs after that. [Gumball and Darwin report the video]
Darwin: I think we need some cuteness now.
[Gumball and Darwin click a video called "Cute Overload." The video plays and begins with a bunch of trolling annotations. Gumball groans and exits them all, revealing another video of "Saxophone Chihuahua."]
Gumball: Oh, come on! [The video immediately cuts back to Elmore Stream-It. Gumball then gasps as he sees another video] Ooh! "Epic Fail!"
"Epic Fail"
[The video begins with a shot of Hector's feet. Pantsbully is walking along the sidewalk and trips and falls over a trash can]
Hector: Ha ha, did you see that? [The camera switches to a shot of Hector's covered face, while he continues to laugh as an airplane hits him from behind, causing the camera to break. The video ends and cuts back to Elmore Stream-It]
Gumball: That's the first one of those I've seen that's actually epic.
Darwin: [Sighs] What's Joe done now?
"Banana Banana"
[The video appears, showing Banana Joe dancing to "Banana Banana."]
Banana Joe: [Autotuned]: I say BA-NAH-NA
Banana Joe's Head: [High Pitched]: And I say BA-NA-NA
Banana Joe: BA-NAH-NA
Banana Joe's Head: BA-NA-NA
Banana Joe: BA-NAH-NA
Banana Joe: [Scatting] I say BA-NAH-NA
Banana Joe's Head: And I say BA-NA-NA
Banana Joe: BA-NAH-NA
Banana Joe's Head: BA-NA-NA
Banana Joe: BA-NAH-NA
Banana Joe's Head: BA-NA-NA
Banana Joe: BA-NAH-NA
Banana Joe's Head: BA-NA-NA
Banana Joe's Butt: [Scatting] Yeah
[The video ends and cuts back to Elmore Stream-It]
Gumball: Dude, we're getting too deep.
Darwin: Then stop clicking.
Gumball: I can't.
[Gumball clicks on the video "Unmissable." Melted Cheese Guy appears breathing deeply]
Darwin: He's not doing anything.
Gumball: Nah, just wait for it. He's got to do something.
[Melted Cheese Guy continues to breathe deeply, taking one deeper breath and then continuing]
Darwin: Dude, this is creepy.
Gumball: Shh! Just wait for it.
[Melted Cheese Guy holds his breath]
Gumball: Oh. I guess it was noth--
["Saxophone Chihuahua" appears, once again. This enrages Gumball, causing him to scream and randomly click the mouse and keyboard]
Darwin: Stop banging your face on the keyboard! You might click another--!
[Gumball accidentally clicks and starts another video named "Tobias Remix"]
Darwin: [Sighs] Too late.
The Elmore Stream Hole
[The video is a distorted remix of the "TobiasX-TremePrank."]
Darwin: Ohh! We're getting sucked into the bottomless pit of Elmore Stream. You need to stop.
Gumball: I can't. I can't. I have to watch it. I have to watch it all. [Gumball exits the video and begins to play every recommended video]
[Gumball starts by playing "Maracacat." It is simply a video of a cat playing the maracas. He then plays "Saang It Jamie." Jamie appears singing in the backseat of a car. Afterwards, Gumball clicks "Walkies !" A woman and Woody appear on-screen]
Woman: Woody, fetch.
[Woody barks and runs to retrieve the stick, dragging the woman with him as she screams. Next Gumball clicks on the video "Don Trump," where Doughnut Cop appears. He plays the trumpet and as he plays it, parts of the video are edited to look like the trumpet he is playing, including extending his trumpet twice, adding trumpets to his eyes and adding one to his butt. Gumball then clicks on "Daisy Meltdown." In the video, Daisy the Donkey and Sally the Snake (as puppets) are fighting, ending with Daisy biting and tackling Sally. Gumball then starts "Corneille'd It." Mr. Corneille plays the kazoo and cello at the same time. Gumball next clicks "W.R.E.C.K.T.R.E," which shows Rob as Dr. Wrecker]
Rob​​​: Revenge!
[Gumball clicks on "Superfan," in which Sarah is hugging a pillow with Gumball and Darwin's faces on it while kneeling on her bed. Afterwards, Gumball clicks on many random unnamed videos. Eventually the videos stop. A screenshot of another video appears as it is buffering]
Darwin: "Ten Hours of Saxophone Chi-hoo-hah?"
Gumball: [Deeper Voice] Oh, thank goodness for that. It's not loading. I think we're done. [The camera finally cuts back to Gumball and Darwin, who are now teenagers in a now-messy room]
Gumball: See? We weren't here that long.
[Gumball gets down from his chair and Darwin follows him on his way out of their room, but they are once again attracted to the computer due to the video finally loading, causing them to watch it]
[Episode ends]
