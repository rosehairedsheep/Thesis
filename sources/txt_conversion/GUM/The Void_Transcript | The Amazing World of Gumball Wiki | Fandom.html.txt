Cheerleading Fail
[At the Elmore Stadium, Gumball and Darwin are watching the cheerleaders practice]
Cheerleaders: Go, Elmore, Go! Go, Elmore, Go!
Gumball: Woo! Ready! Yeah! [fires air horn] Woo! Mexican wave! [Performs a Mexican wave by himself] Listen to the crowd, they love you! [Imitates spectator cheer, then angrily looks at Darwin. Darwin cheers, albeit unenthusiastically] Dude, that sounds like a cow on anesthetics.
Darwin: It's not that I'm not supportive but... they're kind of a train wreck... that like, a truck crashed into... and then the whole thing sunk into a lake... and managed to catch fire... and exploded.
Cheerleaders: Go, Elmore, Go!
[The cheerleaders fall and injure themselves]
Sarah: Ugh, my tail cone…
[Teri gets shredded by Carmen]
Darwin: Alright, I guess they didn't explode, but you have to admit that was- [Explosion]
In the Schoolyard
[The school bell rings. Gumball and Darwin are talking in the schoolyard]
Gumball: Yeah, I know what you mean. They were clearly missing something.
Mister Small​​​​​: [Pops up] You notice too? Stuff goes missing all the time in this town. Everyone pretends it doesn't happen, but I say it's a conspiracy. That's why I've got my hat on! TO STOP THEM ERASING MY MEMORY AND FORGETTING WHAT WAS TAKEN FROM ME!
Gumball: [Nervously] Oh, hehe so it's both fashionable, and useful.
Darwin: What have you lost, Mister Small?
Gumball: [Whispers] His marbles?
Mister Small​​​​: No. The love of my life, Janice.
Darwin: Mr. Small. With all due respect, how do you know that Janice didn't just leave you?
Gumball: Yeah, because of… you know… the hat, the ponytail, and the whole… [Does the coo-coo sign]
Mister Small​​​​: [Laughs insanely] Janice could never leave without me. [Chuckles]
[He walks away]
Mister Small​​​​: [Comes back suddenly] Look for what's not there, look for what doesn't make sense.
Gumball: I think we're looking at it right now.
[Mr. Small walks away again. Gumball and Darwin sigh]
Mister Small​​​​: [Comes back suddenly again] And make a hat!!
In the Hallway
[Darwin puts a book in his locker]
Darwin: You know, I kinda feel something's missing too.
Gumball: Your fingers?
Darwin: No.
Gumball: Hair?
Darwin: No.
Gumball: Some kind of a torso?
Darwin: No, think about it. Something that used to be here at school, but now it's gone. [Sigh] Never mind. [Closes locker] [Gasps] Look at this!
[He gestures to the locker numbers. There is 115 and 117, but-]
Darwin: There's no 116! There's a locker missing.
[He traces his fin along the line where the locker seems to have folded on itself. Both Gumball and Darwin see that the school's section aligned with the locker also folded on itself, with a door being reduced to half its size on the opposite side. The door opens, and the cheerleaders come out. They don't seem aware of this, even when Sarah's head gets lodged in the doorway]
Gumball: Okay. Even I can tell something's missing here.
Darwin: Maybe it's not something. Maybe it's some-
Gumball: Somewhere!?
Darwin: No.
Gumball: Somehow?
Darwin: No.
Gumball: Somewhat?
Darwin: No.
Gumball: Sombrero?
Darwin: No. Someone.
Gumball: Yeah, well. I was gonna say that next, so- [Blows raspberry]
Investigations
Darwin: Let's look at the yearbook. [Flips pages]
Gumball: Stop! Look.
[He points to a photo of a serious Principal Brown, showing only his upper body. Under the photo, someone had drawn a skirt, and slender lady legs to match Principal Brown's upper body. Gumball snickers, but is stopped with Darwin's glare]
Gumball: I mean- STOP! Look.
[This time, he points to a photo of the cheerleaders in a pyramid formation. But one of the cheerleaders holding up the pyramid is missing]
Gumball: It's like someone was… erased.
Darwin: Okay, concentrate. It's gotta be someone we know.
Gumball: [Closes his eyes, and strains] Okay, okay.
[Gumball tries his best to remember. Darwin's voice is heard, and Gumball opens his eyes to find photos floating around in his face]
Darwin: Do do do do- Something's missing Do do do do- [Mutters] Do do do do-who can it be? Do do do do- Remember…
[Darwin continues rotating photos in from of Gumball's face]
Darwin: Do do do do-do do do do-
Gumball: Are you do-do-do-done here?
Darwin: Well what do you do when you need to remember something?
Gumball: The same thing I do when the TV loses signal. [Pounds head repeatedly] Come on you gosh darn piece of junk! This is what happens when you buy cheap knock-offs! [Realizes] It's Molly...
Back in the Schoolyard
[Many students are gathered around Gumball]
Gumball: So you're telling me that in a class full of our friends, who went to school with her your whole life, not one of you remembers Molly?
[Everyone mutters, not knowing who Molly is]
Banana Joe: Wait, did you say Molly?
Gumball: Yes!
Banana Joe: Nah, don't remember her.
Alan​​​: Maybe if you gave us some more details about her, we could all try, and remember together!
Gumball: More details? More details!? WHAT KIND OF FRIENDS ARE YOU?! SHE WAS A GIRL! SHE WAS JUST A GIRL! And that girl's name was Molly! And Molly was your friend…and a girl…
Carrie: You don't remember her either, do you?
Gumball: NO! YOU'RE RIGHT! I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHO SHE IS! BUT NOW THAT I HIT THIS VOLUME, I CAN'T REALLY STEER AWAY BACK DOWN. SO I'M JUST GONNA WALK AWAY [Walks away] SHOUTING. THEN I WON'T HAVE TO ADMIT…
Mr. Small's Office
[Gumball and Darwin enter]
Darwin: Mr. Small! You're not actually crazy!
[Mr. Small, almost naked except for a loin cloth, is meditating with a tin foil hat. Eyes are drawn on his torso, and the top of his head is colored yellow with a vertical red stripe.]
Gumball: Or not completely, anyway.
Darwin: Your conspiracy theory. It's true!
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: I knew it! Red heads are the descendants of an alien race.
Gumball: No, not that one. The people disappearing, remember? We need your help to find our friend, Molly.
Darwin: And your Janice.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: Right. I foresaw that you would come to me, so I made these. [Shows two more tin foil hats, and puts them on Gumball and Darwin]
Darwin: How did you know?
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: [Gestures to torso] The six nipple-eyes see the past, the present, and the future.
Gumball: … [Whispers to Darwin] Six?
[Darwin nods]
Back in the Hallway
[Mr. Small investigates the gap where the missing locker used to be]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: Hmm…yeah, I see...
Gumball: So, what do you think?
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: Oh, You're right. The locker's gone. But there's something left here.
Gumball: Well I don't see anything.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: Look closer.
[Gumball steps forward to gap]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: Closer.
[Gumball steps forward to gap]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: Closer.
[Gumball bumps into gap]
Darwin: I think that might be a little too close.
Gumball: [Muffled] Wait wait! There is something in here. [Pulls out face] Quick, Mr. Small. I need a pin!
[Mr. Small takes a pin from his head, and his head fluff puffs up. With the hairpin, Gumball pulls out a photograph]
Gumball, Darwin and Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: ♪ Clue! ♪
[Darwin looks at it, and sees himself, and Gumball with Molly and her treehouse]
Darwin: [Gasps] Oh yeah! That's Molly.
Gumball: We were definitely friends!
Darwin: How could we not remember? And her treehouse.
Gumball: Yes, yes, that's it! All we have to do now is build a treehouse just like hers, and she'll come right to us!
Darwin: Or we can try, and find hers since that's probably where she is.
Gumball: Or, we could try, and find hers because that's probably where she is!
Darwin: Oh my gosh! That's a much better idea.
The Discovery of a Lifetime
[Cut to the three walking by the streets]
Gumball: Mr. Small, do you remember Molly?
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: Of course I remember her. Thanks to the hat.
Darwin: What was she like? We've completely forgotten about her.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: Well, let's see. She was boring, and uh…ooh…eh…no, that's it. She was just boring.
Darwin: What do you think happened to her?
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: Well kids, Elmore is not a normal place.
[A yellow wig walking its dog passes by]
Dog: Oh, hello!
[A yellow wig Barks]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: It's a pretty weird world, and sometimes it makes mistakes.
Darwin: Do you think the world thought Molly was a mistake?
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: Yeah. If I was the world, I'd be pretty bummed with coming up with someone as boring as Molly- [Trips and falls on face]
Darwin: Mr. Small! Are you okay?
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: Of course! Pain is just information that the mind can master.
Gumball: So it didn't hurt bad?
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: [Sarcastically] No, I feel great.
Darwin: [Gasps] Look! Another clue. Just like at the locker.
[The street is also folded on itself. Gumball takes out the photo from earlier, and compares it to the area]
Gumball: But her whole house is gone. It's like the world folded in on itself again.
[It is revealed that the area were Molly's house has disappeared, sky and all, is flat like a wall]
Gumball: What is this? What's going on here?
[The gap were the world folded in itself sucks in the photograph of Molly with the Wattersons]
Gumball: What-
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: The-
Darwin: What?
[Gumball's face is suck into the gap, and his head is eventually engulfed in it]
Darwin: I got you. I got you!
[Darwin pulls him out. Gumball's face is stretched]
Darwin: Oh my gosh, your face!
Gumball: If you think that's weird, you should see what's in there.
[They prepare to pull the gap apart]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: Are you sure you wanna do this?
Darwin: We have to! We can't forget about our friends.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: Okay. On three. Two. One!
[They pry the gap's sides apart, revealing the Void and all its contents]
Gumball: On second thought, maybe we should just forget about Molly and Janice and stuff. I don't remember Molly anyway. And if the world decided that she was a mistake, then who are we to t-
[Darwin pushes Gumball into the Void]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: Darwin! It wasn't very nice of you to push your brother in such a way. People will allow-
Darwin: [Darwin grabs, and throws Mr. Small into the Void while he continues talking; Throws himself into the Void]
[Blackout]
Into the Void
[The three land on a piece of floating]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: Look, children. All the mistakes the world has ever made.
[He gestures at some floating objects]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: Jorts, Laser Disc, the Mullet.
Darwin: [Points at treehouse] Guys! It's Molly's treehouse.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: Okay! You get her, and I'll find Janice. Whoa! Oh yeah!
[Mr. Small hops his way around on pieces of floating land, and other objects]
Darwin: Mr. Small! Wait! [Hops]
[He lands on a rock cloud while Gumball bounces against some objects, Rob is seen]
Gumball: Oof! How come- [Hits object] you're- [Hits object] so good- [Hits object] at this- [Hits object] jumping!? [Groans]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: Let's just say I'm used to feeling spaced out.
Gumball: Okay. How do we get to the treehouse?
Darwin: [Grabs hairspray] Let's use this highly toxic hairspray from the eighties!
[Cut to Gumball and Darwin flying through the void, using the hairspray to navigate. Darwin's spray goes behind him, to a coughing Gumball, and makes the latter's hair grow. They then climb the treehouse]
Gumball: Molly! Molly?
[Molly, in the middle of pouring her tea, is frozen in the treehouse like a statue]
Darwin: What's wrong with her?
Gumball: Molly? Moll- [Pokes her]
Molly: [Distorts] [Unfreezes] [sing-song voice] Oh, hi!
Darwin: Oh, you're okay.
Gumball: We were so worried!
Darwin: When we…finally remembered you.
Gumball: After a year.
Molly: What do you mean, worried? I saw you yesterday.
Darwin: Are dinosaur years like dog years? Like you saw us yesterday, but it was actually a year ago.
Molly: [Laughs] That wasn't a year ago. Right?
[No response]
Molly: What happened to me?
Darwin: Well, the world thought you were a…you know…how can I say this-
Gumball: It's because you're boring.
Molly: I'm not boring, I do lots of cool stuff! I collect pencils. I got red ones, I got blue ones, I got yellow ones, I got…
[Gumball and Darwin are sleeping while standing up. They suddenly jolt awake]
Darwin: What were we doing?
Gumball: We were getting out of here.
Escaping the Void
[Gumball, Darwin, and Molly are now outside the treehouse]
Gumball: Okay Molly, we just have to get back through that big hole, and we're home.
Molly: You mean that hole over there, the one that's shrinking, and almost closed?
Gumball: Yes, exactly. The one that's- OH MY GOSH IT'S CLOSING!
[They hop their way to the hole]
Gumball: Quick! The world doesn't want you to escape!
[He runs across a piece of land, while Molly and Darwin hop]
Gumball: What are you guys doing!?
Darwin: Well, I dunno. I thought using these would be a good idea.
Gumball: Dude, everything here is a bad idea! Do I have to spell it out for you?
[A paperclip appears in front of them]
Paperclip: Hey! Are you writing an email?
[Gumball smacks the paperclip with a shoe. This activates a dance floor, and some music]
Gumball: Oh no, we gotta get out of here! We're in the world of disco!
[They run away, screaming]
Molly: But I love disco. [Follows them]
[They hop on a dirigible]
Gumball: I don't know why they got rid of these. They're pretty cool.
[The dirigible catches fire]
Gumball: Oh. Right.
[Molly, Gumball, and Darwin run away, screaming one more. The dirigible hits a tower, and explodes. Meanwhile on another piece of land…]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: Janice! Janice! [Looks inside a tube] Janice! [Dials phone] Janice!
[The three others hop on the plot of land]
Darwin: Oh no, guys! The hole's almost closed!
Gumball: Mr. Small, we have to go!
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: No no no! She has to be-I see her! [Runs off]
[The three others follow him]
Gumball: I'm guessing librarian, flowered t-shirt-
Darwin: Yeah. And thick prescription glasses.
Gumball and Darwin: Huh?
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: Here she is, kids! Meet Janice.
[He shows them a colorful van with art on it]
Darwin: Janice is a van?
Gumball: I can see why the world thought it was a mistake.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: She runs on sunflower oil, and good vibes. And we've got plenty of those, right?
[They get in]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: Okay! Let's go.
[Janice doesn't start up. But a voice imitating it starting up is heard]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: Well that's weird. I haven't even turned the key yet.
[In front of them, they see Crazy Frog pretending to drive a motorcycle]
Gumball: Run him over.
[The person is then chased away by Dodos]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: Ooh. That won't be necessary. He's gone the way of the dodo. [Starts up van]
[He drives it up the piece of land, and into the hole. But it stops just as it exits, and hole becomes smaller. The van reverses back. Mr. Small tries to start the van again]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: No! Come on. Come on!
Gumball: Let me try something. [Pounds on dashboard] Come on you gosh darn piece of junk!
[Everyone follows his lead. Darwin stops]
Darwin: Hey, wait. I thought you ran on good vibes. [Kisses Janice]
[The van immediately starts up, and leaving rainbow exhaust behind propels itself through the hole]
Back in Elmore
[A clap of thunder, followed by Janice and all her occupants appearing occurs. The van drives around in circles]
Gumball: AH! Watch the trash, watch the car, watch the truck! Trash, car, truck, trash, car, truck! Please stop the van, I'm gonna be sick!
[The van finally stops. They all cheer]
Gumball: Yeah! We did it! In your face, world!
Darwin: Guys, wait! Do you realize what we've just seen? This changes everything.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: We must tell everyone before the world tries to make us forget.
Molly: But how could we forget something like that?
[The Void sucks up their tin foil hats, along with their memories of being in it]
Gumball: What were we talking about again?
