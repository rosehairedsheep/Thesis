Family History
[Richard, holding an old watch, is telling Gumball a story]
Richard: This watch has been at the center of a feud between the Watterson and Finklehimer families for centuries. It was found by your great-great-great-great-grandfather Bucktooth Watterson, who lost it to an evil man called One-Legged Finklehimer in a jig contest. However, Bucktooth's son, your great-great-great-grandfather... [Skips] ...but then Ebenezer Finklehimer took it, even through he had never slapped a peacock in his entire life! [Time passes] ...believe me or not, all that time, the watch was hidden inside Louie Finklehimer's girdle... [Even more time passes] ...then, when my dad finally retrieved the watch after a good old yodeling contest, he gave it to me. And now, little man, I give the watch to you. [Hands the watch to Gumball]
[On the school bus, Gumball has the watch in his hand]
Gumball: Aww, I hate it! This watch is wonder weak, it doesn't even tell the time. What the derp is V past X supposed to mean?
Darwin: Wait, did you get that from Dad?
Gumball: How'd you know?
Darwin: He offered it to me first. He told me this really long boring story full of people I didn't care about, and I said "No! I don't want no busted up cowboy junk."
Gumball: [Hands the watch to Darwin] Do you mind holding this for a second? I need to tie my shoelace.
Darwin: Sure. [Realizes something] Wait, you don't have any shoes.
[Gumball appears on top of the seat behind Darwin]
Gumball: He who holds it, owns it.
[Gumball slowly goes down]
Darwin: Aw!
The Watch Switches Hands
[Gumball is walking down the school corridor, Darwin runs to him]
Darwin: Okay, okay! I'll keep it. But on one condition, if at any point Dad offers us a better present, I get dibs. Deal?
Gumball: Deal.
[They shake hands]
Darwin: [Smugly] Now check your hands.
Gumball: What? This one, [Reveals his hand is empty] or this one? [His other hand is also empty] Now check yours.
[Darwin is suddenly holding the watch in his fin]
Darwin: WHAT?!
[Gumball has disappeared]
Darwin: DOUBLE WHAT?!
[Gumball appears in the left corner while moving his arms around his face, like a magician, then leaves]
[At the Wattersons' house, Darwin tells Gumball what he did with the watch]
Darwin: I gave it to an old man.
Gumball: WHAT?!
Darwin: I said, [Yells] "I gave it to an old man!"
Gumball: Shh! I heard it the first time, it's just that you DON'T GIVE AWAY A FAMILY HEIRLOOM TO SOME RANDOM GUY!
Darwin: But I thought you were trying to get rid of it.
Gumball: [Sighs] What's Dad gonna say now?
Darwin: [Gasps] Is he gonna cry? 'Cause if he's gonna cry, I'll cry.
Gumball: Oh, don't cry, bubble cheeks, it's my fault as well.
[Gumball and Darwin hug and then talk quietly]
Darwin: So, since it's obviously your fault, you're gonna get it back right?
Gumball: Well, I would if you hadn't been an total slack-jawed goober and gave it to him.
Darwin: But none of this would have happened if you hadn't been such an ungrateful jerk in the first place.
Gumball: You do it.
Darwin: No, you do it.
Gumball: No, you do it.
Richard: [whispering] What are you guys talking about?
[We see Richard hugging Gumball and Darwin]
Gumball: Uh, how much we like the watch?
Richard: [Still whispering] I love you guys.
The Watterson-Finklehimer Feud Continues
[At the seniors' house, Gumball and Darwin are crying on the ground for the watch]
Marvin: I'd be more than happy to give this watch back, if it belonged to you! But my name is Marvin Finklehimer, and this watch belongs to the Finklehimer family.
[Gumball whispers to Darwin]
Gumball: Dude, did you really have to give it to a Finklehimer?
Marvin: Ha! Call that poetic justice.
Gumball: Can you really turn down a helpless crying child?
Marvin: You're not crying.
[Gumball tries to cry]
Darwin: Dude, are you trying to cry, or lay an egg?
[Gumball struggles to cry, holding his hand up, then his eyes explode]
Marvin: Get off my lawn.
[At the school cafeteria, the recess bell rings]
Darwin: What are we gonna do?
Gumball: Well, we just have to agree to never speak about that watch again.
Darwin: But I feel so guilty...
Gumball: Then we shall deal with our emotions like grown-ups: push them down deep inside ourselves and ignore them for the rest of our lives.
[Gumball swallows a pea, but the pea comes out of his stomach and back up his throat, causing him to spit it out and hit Darwin]
Darwin: Oof! Hey! What was that?
[Gumball starts crying]
Gumball: It's the guilt, I have a massive knot in my stomach and my body just won't let me eat, we have to get that watch back somehow!
Marvin: For the last time, there's nothing in this world that I'd want to trade for this watch!
Gumball: Hmmm. [Walks to foreground] What about the one thing that man has desired since the dawn of time? What about the one thing a man at the dusk of his life craves for more than anything else? What about the secret that has eluded every scientist, alchemist and adventurer of this world? What about-
[Gumball moves very close to Marvin]
Gumball: Eternal youth?
Darwin: [Echoes] Youth..youth..youth..youth.
Marvin: I'm listening.
Gumball: Don't have it.
Darwin: But how about a girlfriend?
Marvin: Deal.
Gumball: We might need to make you look a little younger.
Persuasion
[At the restaurant Dump's Cave, Marvin is on a dinner date with the Hexagon Lady]
Hexagon lady: So, Marvin, how long have you been so... surprised?
[Marvin is revealed to have lots of binder clips holding up all his wrinkles, supposedly to make him appear younger]
Marvin: Ahhhhh... [The clips on the left side of his face drops off, revealing sagging facial features. He smiles nervously]
Hexagon lady: [To waiter] Check, please.
Darwin: It's not our fault you weren't compatible!
Marvin: It is your fault for giving me that back alley facelift!
Darwin: It was either that or a bag over your head, her advert said no one over twenty-five!
Gumball: I'm sorry, dude, but you kinda look like a microwaved toad.
Marvin: [Waves his cane] Get out of here, I'm keeping the watch!
[Gumball grabs Marvin's cane and hefts it in his hands]
Gumball: I wish it didn't have to come to this, Marvin.
Marvin: [Whimpers] What you are doing?
Gumball: [Holds up the cane] I'm gonna beat myself senseless, call the cops and accuse you of doing it!
Marvin: [Calms down, and scoffs] Huh, I think you're a bit too lily-livered for that, son.
Gumball: I don't know what that means, but I'm gonna prove it wrong. [Knocks himself in the head with the cane]
[Gumball knocks himself in the head once, then his eyes fail to focus. He becomes delusional and starts talking with difficulty; it is evident that the blow dealt him brain damage]
Gumball: [Slurring] Ok, I can't remember why I'm angry at you, so I'm gonna go.
Betty​​​​: Is he talking to me now?
Gumball: [Gives back the cane] No, dude, I'm talking to you. [Points at Marvin]
Darwin: Ok, I'm gonna walk you home now.
Gumball: I can walk home by myself, I'm perfectly capable of putting one foot in front of the other foot... [Goes right and leaves the scene while babbling]
Darwin: [Sighs] I don't have the heart to tell him that he's going the wrong way.
Last Resort
[In the Wattersons' kitchen, nothing happens in the scene for a while, until Gumball pops out from the sink]
Gumball: [Gasps for air] I can't hide like this anymore, we're just gonna have to tell Dad the truth.
[Darwin pops out of a Super Golden Flakes cereal box]
Darwin: Oh sure, great plan. So how do you want to do it? You can start by rejecting his love, while I sucker punch him with the lack of respect that we have for his entire family heritage or, if you prefer, I'll just rip out his heart while you TEAR HIS SOUL IN HALF!
Gumball: Get out of your box, you just gave me an idea.
[Someone with a scythe rings the doorbell to Marvin's house. Marvin opens the door, and is shocked]
Grim Reaper: [Ominous voice] I'VE COME FOR YOU, MARVIN.
Marvin: [Gasps, then faints]
[Gumball and Darwin get out of the Grim Reaper costume]
Gumball: What have we done?!
Darwin: You said he'd just bargain for his life with the watch, but instead he's gone the way of the dodo!
Gumball: Just give him CPR.
[Darwin pushes Gumball out of the way and futilely attempts to perform CPR by blowing air into Marvin's mouth]
Gumball: What the? Do it properly, man!
Darwin: I'm not touching his mouth, it looks like the end of an elephant's trunk.
Gumball: Ok, hold on. [Gumball runs into the house while Darwin continues to do his "CPR"]
Gumball: [Comes out of the house] Move aside. [Darwin moves aside while Gumball puts tissue paper around Marvin's mouth] Come on Marvin, don't go into the light.
[Gumball prepares to perform CPR on Marvin but Darwin stops him]
Darwin: No, wait!
[One of the sheets of tissue paper is moving, which shows Marvin is still breathing]
Darwin: Ahh, he's been breathing all this time.
Gumball: Shhhhh. [Points at the watch in Marvin's hat]
[Gumball slowly reaches for the watch but Marvin suddenly wakes up]
Marvin: I'M KEEPING THE WATCH!
Gumball and Darwin: AHHHHHHH! [Gumball runs to Darwin's side]
Marvin: It belongs to my family, NOT YOURS!
Gumball: [Sighs] Look sir, I shouldn't have given that watch to Darwin and he shouldn't have given it to you, so now I'm begging you- [Camera changes to Marvin's face as he becomes less angry] 'Cause all I care about is that my dad gave it to me, it'll break his heart when I tell him I lost it.
Marvin: [appears to soften up, but suddenly mocks Gumball] Me me me me me me me me me.
Confessions
[Richard is playing video games, the camera then shows Gumball and Darwin with puppy eyes]
Darwin: Hey Mr. Dad, you look great, have you lost weight?
Richard: Hmmm, let me check. [Richard's moves his head and counts the folds of fat under his chin] One, two, three, four five six. No, same as always. Wait a minute, what have you done wrong?
Gumball: [Surprised] What? What gave it away?
Richard: That's what I always ask your mother before I confess something terrible.
Gumball: [Starts crying] I was just messin', but Darwin... and I gave the watch to him...
Darwin: [Starts crying too] And then I gave it to Marvin, and then we tried to get it back, but he wouldn't give it back!
Richard: [Crying as well] What... are you... talking about?
Gumball: The watch!
Richard: [Stops crying and plays video game] What? That weird Roman compass thing? No one cares about that.
[Gumball and Darwin stop crying]
Gumball: Really?
Richard: Yeah, I just wanted to get rid of it. I even tried to give it to Anais before giving it to Darwin. Just tell Marvin he can keep it.
[Gumball rings the doorbell and Marvin comes out]
Gumball: Hey, Marvin, listen I just-
Marvin: [Puts his hand out] Let me stop you there. I've been thinking, I only wanted this watch because my father wanted it all his life, and by keeping it, I'm sentencing you to the same punishment, so please take it. [Puts his hand out with the watch]
Gumball: Let me stop you there. [Grabs Marvin's hands] We just found out that our dad doesn't care, so you can keep it. [Pushes Marvin's hand back]
Marvin: No, I want you to have it. [Gives Gumball the watch]
Gumball: [Reveals an empty hand] Check your hands, you keep it.
Marvin: [Reveals an empty hand as well] Hmmmm, check behind your ear, you keep it.
Gumball: [Gumball checks behind his ears and reveals an empty hand yet again] Now check inside your pants.
Marvin: But I don't wear any- [Marvin is suddenly wearing pants] Ha ha ha, OK kid, how 'bout this? I'll keep it for now but it's still yours. You can get it back anytime you like, deal?
Gumball: Deal.
[Scene changes to the Wattersons' TV which is showing an auction channel]
Dealer: This table is worth about a thousand dollars.
Customer: Oh, my.
Dealer: However, this coffee stain brings the value down to about ten dollars.
[Camera changes to show Gumball, Darwin and Richard laughing and then changes back to the TV]
Dealer: Now this pocket watch is a very special piece. Only two were ever made and I'd say it's worth approximately seven-hundred dollars.
[The customer and the Wattersons gasp and the scene switches to Marvin who is watching the same show in his living room]
Dealer: So, if you're lucky enough to have the other one of these rare timepieces, I suggest you cash it in right away.
[Marvin grins evilly]
The Feud Ends
[Both the Wattersons and Marvin get out of their houses, then Marvin gets on his electric scooter and tries to escape. The Wattersons run after him but stop as Richard kneels to the ground]
Richard: Noooo, we're never gonna get him!
Darwin: I don't know, we could probably catch up with him if we jog.
Richard: Noooo, we're never gonna get him!
Darwin: Wait, I've got an idea! [Asks Donald] Can we borrow your scooter sir?
Donald: Sure, but you're going to have to fight me for it. [Tries to get out of his chair, but after several failed attempts he sits back down, extremely fatigued] Just take it.
[The Wattersons chase Marvin on electric scooters, Darwin and Gumball on one and Richard on another]
Gumball: We'll never catch him!
[Richard turns around and sees Patrick jogging toward them]
Richard: Don't worry, I have an idea!
[Richard jumps onto Patrick's back]
Patrick: What the- Hey! What do you think you're doing- [Richard twists Patrick's antlers and he speeds up like a motorcycle] Woahhhhhhhh!
[Richard catches up with Marvin and he jumps onto his scooter]
Richard: A-ha! Gimme back the watch you prune-faced pincher.
Marvin: Get your sausage fingers out of my face. [Bites Richard's arm]
Richard: AHH HA HA, it's all gummy and lukewarm! Gah! [falls off]
[Marvin laughs. but is rammed by Gumball and Darwin]
Gumball: You said we could have it back anytime we want.
Marvin: Oh, you can have it right now.
Gumball: Really?
Marvin: For seven-hundred dollars! [Kicks Gumball and Darwin's scooter away]
Gumball and Darwin: Ahhhhhhhh! [As they slowly hit the glass carried by Construction Men]
Gumball: What are you doing carrying glass through a park?!
Hank: What are you doing ramming into an octogenarian on a battery-powered wheelchair?
Gumball: Yeah, fair point. [Scooter reverses]
[Scene changes to Marvin riding in his scooter]
Marvin: Seven-hundred dollars! I can finally afford to pay off my credit card bills! Or maybe I'll buy those gold dentures I've seen in hip hop videos!
Richard: I'll tell you what you need to buy! BANDAGES! [Jumps from the roof of the restroom. He is too early, so he faceplants into the ground] Owwww.
Marvin: I'll mail 'em to ya. Ahahahaha! [Drives around Richard]
Gumball: This isn't over, Marvin!
[The scene changes to Gumball and Darwin's scooter which is coming down a flight of stairs. In order to avoid collision, both scooters swerve sharply]
Gumball and Darwin: Ahhhhh.
Marvin: [Drops the watch] Ahhhh, the watch!
[Both scooters end up facing each other, with the watch right in between]
Marvin: Forget it, Watterson, the watch is mine and therefore the money is mine!
Gumball: It was never yours, and it will never be, Marvin Finklehimer!
[Both scooters move towards each other]
Marvin: Ughhhhh.
Gumball: Ahhhhhh.
Marvin: Ughhhhh!
Gumball: Ahhhhhh!
Marvin: UGHHHHHH!
Gumball: AHHHHHHH!
Marvin: UGHHHHHH!
Gumball: AHHHHHHH! [Talks to Darwin] Are we actually gonna risk our lives for seven-hundred dollars?
Darwin: Let's bail. [Gumball and Darwin jump off the scooter]
Marvin: Yeah, fair point. [Marvin gets off too]
[Richard runs into the scene]
Richard: [As the scooters are about to hit each other] Get out of the way, it's gonna explode!
[The scooters hit each other with a harmless "tong." Richard calms down]
Darwin: Hey, that's great, now we can sell the watch and split the money.
[The episode ends with a freeze frame of both scooters exploding, presumably destroying the watch]
