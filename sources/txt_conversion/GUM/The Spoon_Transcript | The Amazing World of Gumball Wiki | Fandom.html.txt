Yay! Adventure!
[The episode opens at night time at the Wattersons' house]
Richard: Okay, kids! Mom will be home any minute now. Have you all wrapped your birthday presents?
Gumball, Darwin and Anais: [They hold up their wrapped presents] Yay!
Anais: And you, Dad, what did you get her?
Richard: [With a bright smile] Nothing!
Gumball, Darwin and Anais: [Shocked] What?!
Richard: [Screams in panic] AAAH! I forgot! What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?! [Tugs at his ears] What... am... I... gonna... do?! [Sobs]
Anais: How about you buy her a present?
Richard: [Grabs Anais] Yes! Wait. No. I have to watch the kids. Hmm... [Thinks, then suddenly gets an idea] Hey, guys. You don’t have to watch the kids. [Hands a bill to Gumball] Here’s a twenty. Go buy her something special— from the gas station.
Gumball and Darwin: [Running off giddily] Yay! Adventure!
[Anais watches them leave, then facepalms]
He's Got a Spoon!
[The scene cuts to the Gas Station, with Gumball and Darwin giddily running in]
Larry: [Asleep, then gets startled awake by the door beep] Yah! Welcome to the Gas Station, where we never sleep, cause we're not allowed to...
Gumball and Darwin: [Race past] Hi, mister!
[Sal Left Thumb enters the Gas Station behind the kids]
Larry: Can I help you?
Sal Left Thumb: Yeah. Can it and hand over the cash.
Larry: Ha ha... What?
Sal Left Thumb: Don't make me use this! [Pulls out a rusty spoon]
Larry: Oh my gosh... He’s got a spoon! [Starts running in circles] He’s got a spo— [Smacks into the glass wall surrounding the register and falls unconscious]
Sal Left Thumb: Ha. Sucker.
[Security camera footage shows Sal dragging Larry out of the register area]
The Perfect Present!
[Cut to Darwin and Gumball, walking towards the register, with Gumball holding a card]
Darwin: Show it again! Show it again!
Gumball: Okay, but it’s the last time. We have to get it back home.
[Gumball holds up the card. It’s a holographic card that switches between a woman sitting in a park and an amazon standing in fire]
Darwin: It’s like the best gift ever!
Gumball: Yeah, Mom’s gonna love it!
[Gumball and Darwin walk up to the window, where Sal is rapidly pulling money out of the register. Gumball taps on the window, startling Sal]
Gumball: Excuse me, sir, what are you doing? [Gasps] Are you robbing the store?!
Sal Left Thumb: [Sarcastically] Nah. I’m collecting for charity!
Gumball and Darwin: [Get sparkly eyed] Whoa!
Gumball: Awesomely kind! Which charity is it?
Sal Left Thumb: [Caught off guard] Oh, er... [Looks around trying to make up something and sees a rack of eggs behind Gumball] Bald people!
Gumball and Darwin: Can we help?
Sal Left Thumb: You’re kidding, right?
Gumball: We’d never joke about bald people!
Sal Left Thumb: Ha. All right, kids! [Hands them a money bag] Just go fill up the baggie with anything valuable.
Gumball and Darwin: Yay! [Giddily run off again]
Sal Left Thumb: Ha. Suckers. [Goes back to ripping money out of the register]
"Collecting for Charity"
[Security camera footage shows Gumball and Darwin running down an aisle]
Gumball: What could bring a smile to their little bald faces?
Darwin: Hmm...
Gumball: [Points] Ooh! Ooh! Sunglasses! [Grabs a pair of heart-shaped sunglasses from a rack. Darwin is seen wearing star-shaped sunglasses]
Gumball and Darwin: Oooooh!
Gumball: [Points again] Ahh! Ahh! A bikini! [Grabs a blue/green patterned bikini bottom from another rack and puts them on. Darwin is also wearing a bikini bottom]
Gumball and Darwin: Whoaaaa!
Gumball: Fake mustache! [Grabs one] Make-up! [Grabs some lipstick]
Darwin: Wigs? [Reaches for one] Nah.
Gumball: A princess tiara? [Grabs one]
Gumball and Darwin: Yeah! [Gumball and Darwin are shown wearing everything they took, with the fully stuffed bag behind them] I’m bald and I’m proud!
Uh Oh! The Police!
[Cut back to the register, which Sal is still pulling money out of. Police sirens are suddenly heard approaching]
Sal Left Thumb: Uh oh! [A police car pulls up outside] Five-Oh! Here comes the Po-Po!
Gumball: Hey, Mr. Charity Man! [Appears with Darwin] We’re done!
Sal Left Thumb: [Gets an idea] Hey, suckers. I need you to do something for me.
Gumball and Darwin: Yay! More charity work!
Sal Left Thumb: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. You see that man?
[The Doughnut Sheriff gets out of the police car]
Sal Left Thumb: He will spoil the surprise if he sees me here. [Points at the wanted sign behind him, which shows him] I’m pretty famous in the charity business.
Gumball and Darwin: Ohhhh.
Gumball: I get it.
Sal Left Thumb: So you distract him for me.
Gumball and Darwin: Yay!
Sal Left Thumb: Ha ha. [Ducks down behind the register]
Donut Sheriff: [Enters the store, tossing a burrito into his mouth, which naturally goes right through him] That’s the third burrito I’ve had, and I’m still hungry.
Gumball and Darwin: [Pop up behind the register, wearing Gas Station Hats and still wearing the fake mustaches] Hi, Officer! How can we distract you today?
Donut Sheriff: I’m sort of looking for something that could fill me up?
Gumball and Darwin: Follow us! [Walk off to the Hot Dog Store in the shop]
Gumball: [Holds out a hot dog] How about a hot dog? They’re delicious! [His fake mustache falls off his face and lands on the hot dog, which he holds out to the Sheriff]
Donut Sheriff: Enh...
Sal Left Thumb: No!
Donut Sheriff: There’s a mustache on your sausage!
Gumball: Yeah, it’s our secret ingredient!
[Gumball and Darwin wink]
Donut Sheriff: I think I’ll go for something without hair.
[Sal wipes sweat off and sighs in relief]
Donut Sheriff: Maybe some Marshmallow Heart-Stoppers?
[He picks up a box, revealing the tied up Larry. Sal gasps panicked]
Donut Sheriff: Nah, not enough sugar...
[He puts the box back, not noticing Larry, Sal ducks down again. The Sheriff sees a doughnut sitting in a box]
Donut Sheriff: Oh! A doughnut! That could fill a hole!
Sal Left Thumb: [Whispering to Gumball] Just get rid of him!
Gumball and Darwin: [Whispers back] Okay. [Runs over and grabs a doughnut] You want it?
Donut Sheriff: Yes, yes, yes!
Gumball: Really?
Donut Sheriff: Yes!
Gumball: You really, really want it?
Donut Sheriff: Yeeeeeeeesssss!
Gumball: Then... Fetch! [Throws the doughnut out the door, with the Sheriff chasing it] He’s gone, Mr. Charity Man!
Sal Left Thumb: Great! Good job! Now get back to looting— Er, I mean, collecting for charity!
Gumball and Darwin: Yay! [They race off giddily once more]
Sal Left Thumb: Now. Let’s get back to business.
Where’s the Safe?
[Sal pulls the tape off Larry’s mouth, causing him to yell in pain]
Sal Left Thumb: So, Mr. "Employee of the Month", where is the safe?
Larry: I won’t tell you anything! They would fire me!
Sal Left Thumb: Oh really? What would they do about this? [Grabs a pair of sunglasses, starts bending them]
Larry: No! Please! They’ll take it off my salary!
Sal Left Thumb: [Snaps the sunglasses] Whoops.
Larry: You heartless monster! That was twenty-five cents!
Sal Left Thumb: Now where is the safe? [Holds up a snowglobe]
Larry: I won't tell you!
Sal Left Thumb: [Drops the snowglobe] Whoops.
Larry: No! That was thirty-five cents!
Sal Left Thumb: [Another object is broken] Whoops.
Larry: No, wait! That was two fifty reduced from three ninety-five!
Sal Left Thumb: Now will you talk?
Larry: Never!
Sal Left Thumb: Your choice. [Holds up a wooden coo-coo clock]
Larry: Nooooo!
[Sal breaks the clock, coo-coo-ing is heard]
The Safe!
[Cut back to Gumball and Darwin, who are standing in front of a stack of shampoo bottles]
Gumball: Look, Darwin! Shampoo!
Darwin: Perfect for bald people!
[Gumball pulls out a bottle, which causes the whole display to collapse, revealing a safe]
Gumball and Darwin: Ooh.
Darwin: What’s that?
Gumball: It’s a safe, Darwin! It’s full of money! And what do bald people need more of?
Darwin: Friends?
Gumball: Exactly! And how do you buy friends?
Darwin: Uhhh...
Gumball: With money!
Gumball and Darwin: Yay!
Gumball: [Notices the keypad] Oh. There’s a lock. What number should I try?
Darwin: Um... Two!
Gumball: [Pushes a button on the lock, nothing happens] Nah, doesn’t work.
Darwin: Seven!
Gumball: [Pushes another button, nothing happens] No.
Darwin: Nine!
Gumball: [Pushes another button, nothing happens] Nope.
Darwin: Well, that’s all the numbers I know! Try two again.
Gumball: [Pushes another button, nothing happens, then sighs] I guess we’ll have to use brute force!
Happy Birthday!
[Cut back to the Wattersons’ house, Nicole walks in the front door]
Richard and Anais: [Pop out from behind the couch] Happy Birthday!
Nicole: [Jumps with a shriek, startled] Oh... Thanks. [Notices Gumball and Darwin are missing] Where are the boys?
Richard: Well, I forgot your birthday, so I sent them down to the gas station to get you a present.
Nicole: What?!
Richard: Oh. Is it the birthday, or sending two kids downtown at night on their own?
Nicole: [Yelling] Put your pants on and get in the car!
Brute Force!
[Sped up security camera footage shows Gumball and Darwin’s attempts to open the safe. They punch, kick, and whack at it with crowbars to no avail. After stopping to catch their breath, they start hitting it more, then try ramming a pair of shopping carts into it, with no luck]
Gumball: [Panting] We’re never gonna crack it.
Safe Lock: You know, you only have to ask nicely.
Gumball and Darwin: Please?
[The safe opens up, revealing piles of money. Gumball and Darwin get starry-eyed]
Gumball and Darwin:  Whoa!
He’s Got a Spoon! Again!
[Richard, Nicole and Anais are walking into the Gas Station]
Nicole: I can’t believe you sent the kids to the gas station at this hour.
Richard: Come on, honey. What’s the worst that could happen?
[The three get shocked as they walk into the Gas Station and see the tied up Larry]
Richard: Hey.
Sal Left Thumb: [Suddenly jumps out] Freeze, suckers! [He threatens each of them in turn with the spoon]
Richard: [Freaks out] He’s got a spoon!
[Richard runs around screaming, then crashes into the shelf next to Larry and is knocked out, Anais and Nicole facepalm]
Sal Left Thumb: Ha! Sucker.
Not a Good Guy
[Gumball and Darwin are making their way back with a bag of money]
Gumball: Hey, Mr. Charity Man! We’ve got money for the—
[Gumball and Darwin see Richard, Nicole, and Anais tied up]
Gumball: Bald... Hi Mom! Hi Dad! Why are you tied up?
[Nicole and Richard talk, but are muffled by the tape across their mouths]
Gumball: Ohhh. He’s not really a good guy, is he?
Sal Left Thumb: Oh, come on! You really are suckers! Now gimme the money!
Gumball and Darwin: No!
Gumball: [Pushes Darwin] Run, Darwin! Run! [Runs off as well]
Sal Left Thumb: Gimme that bag right now! [Chases them]
[Security Camera footage shows Sal running down an aisle after Gumball and Darwin, whom he soon catches up with]
Sal Left Thumb: [Brandishing the spoon] Give me the money! [Gets hit by a loaf of bread, a pebble, a cabbage and a marshmallow] Oh, come on. You're not going to stop me with a marshmallow. [Gets clanged by a frozen sausage] OW! That sausage was frozen!
[Gumball and Darwin race off again, with Sal in pursuit. They eventually grab a bikini bottom and a tire, setting the bikini bottom as a slingshot to fire the tire at Sal, running him over. This only seems to make him angrier, however. Gumball and Darwin scream and run off once more]
Richard Does Something
[Back at the entrance, Nicole, Richard and Anais are still tied up]
Nicole: [Muffled, subtitled] Richard, do something.
Richard: [Muffled, subtitled] Don’t worry, honey. I know exactly what to do. [Inhales, turning his lips inside out, and catching the tape on his tongue] Ha ha!
[Richard swallows the tape, then tips himself over and starts crawling across the floor, only to stop and start licking the mustached sausage. He throws a wink back to Nicole. Nicole sighs]
The Syrup Trap
[Gumball is squeezing a bottle of maple syrup onto the floor]
Gumball: Don’t worry. I’ve covered his approach with maple syrup.
Darwin: And I covered our way out!
[Camera zooms out to reveal two puddles of maple syrup, trapping Gumball between them]
Gumball: What?! How am I supposed to escape?!
Darwin: Watch out! He’s coming!
[Sal is seen running towards them. Gumball screams and tries to run, but gets stuck in the puddle of syrup. Sal Left Thumb gets stuck in the other one. They begin to grunt and step across the puddles, with Gumball trying to escape and Sal trying to grab him]
Sal Left Thumb: [Grunts] Gotcha—
[With a pop, Gumball is suddenly free and runwalks away]
Sal Left Thumb: Huh? [Faceplants into the syrup puddle from leaning too far forward] Ow! [Pulls his head up, growling, turning red with fury]
Nicole Has to Do Everything Herself
[Back at the entrance, Richard is still licking the sausage, Nicole gives an exasperated groan]
Nicole: [Muffled, subtitled] Why do I have to do everything myself?
[Taking matters into her own hands, Nicole scoots a bit to the left, triggering an ice cream machine to squirt ice cream on her ropes. She then scootches over to Richard, who pulls away from the hot dog, smelling the ice cream]
Richard: Ahh! Ice cream! [Opens his mouth widely to take a bite]
Up, Up, and Away!
Sal Left Thumb: [Searching for Gumball and Darwin] Gimme! That! Money!
[Gumball grabs a helium tank from a shelf]
Sal Left Thumb: Or I’ll tear it out of your sorry little hands!
[Gumball and Darwin run past unnoticed and grab a funnel]
Sal Left Thumb: Come on. You know I’ll find yas.
[Gumball and Darwin grab helmets]
Sal Left Thumb: Where are yas? [Suddenly looks around, getting a bad feeling] What the!? [Ducks, narrowly avoiding a rigged rocket made from the helium tank, that Gumball and Darwin are riding on]
Gumball: Ha ha! Try and catch us now!
[Sal screams in anger and frustration, then kicks some baskets off a nearby push cart and hops on, using it as a vehicle of his own. A chase begins throughout the store]
Darwin: Faster!
[Sal speeds up even more]
Gumball: He’s gaining on us! We need to go faster!
Darwin: [Salutes] Okay! [Reaches back and turns the nozzle to maximum, sending the air tank into warp speed] Is this fast enough?
Gumball: Yeaaaaaaaaah!
[The air tank goes out of control, and Sal can only watch it fly away. As he does, he fails to watch where he’s going and crashes into a wall. The air tank flies completely out of control, with Gumball and Darwin hanging on for dear life. They crash through a display of cans, but remain on the air tank]
Gumball and Darwin: Yes! We made it! Ha ha ha ha—
Gumball: Oh...
[They end up crashing into a wall themselves]
Mistaken Identity
[Gumball and Darwin are left laying on a pile of goods, with a can falling on Gumball’s head. Sal approachs, and the two gasp]
Sal Left Thumb: Game over suckers.
Gumball: [Looks around, and notices the mustached sausage] Not yet! [Loads the sausage into the air tank, which fires it like a cannon]
Sal Left Thumb: No— [Manages to duck, as the sausage embeds itself in a paint can] Ha ha! Now gimme the dough! [Grabs the money bag]
Gumball and Darwin: No!
Sal Left Thumb: Gimme!
Darwin: No!
Sal Left Thumb: Gimme!
Darwin: No!
Sal Left Thumb: Gimme!
Darwin: No!
Sal Left Thumb: Gimme!
Darwin: No!
Sal Left Thumb: All right, you’ve asked for this! [Pulls out the spoon]
Darwin: Oh my gosh! He’s got a spoon!
Gumball: Such violence...
[Gumball and Darwin faint, Sal grabs the moneybag]
Sal Left Thumb: Heh heh... Ya suckers—
[Sal suddenly gets hit from behind, and falls over, revealing Nicole brandishing the sausage]
Nicole: Stop calling my kids "suckers", please. [Looks over the boys] Oh, my poor little angels. Are you all right? [Picks up the money bag]
Donut Sheriff: [Has re-entered the store] Hey guys, I just realized that I didn’t pay for the dough... nut... [Camera points to the unconscious Gumball and Darwin, the tied up Larry, and the sausage and money bag in Nicole’s hands, then the Sheriff pulls out his taser] Drop the sausage, lady!
Nicole: Oh, come on, it wasn’t me, it was the finger— 
[Camera points to Sal, who now looks like nothing more than a large fingerprint on the floor]
Nicole: Print... guy...
Donut Sheriff: [Puts a hand on Nicole’s shoulder] Tell that to the judge, lady.
Who's the Sucker Now?
[The scene fades to Nicole sitting in a cell. Her depressed look, however, instantly changes when she hears the family]
Gumball, Darwin and Anais: Happy birthday, Mom! [Camera points to outside the cell, revealing them with a cake] You’re the coolest mom ever! We love you, Mom!
[Nicole looks close to tears]
Donut Sheriff: Okay lady, you’re in the clear! [Escorts Sal to the cell] We caught this guy trying to rob a convenience store with a spoon. A spoon! [Laughs and slams the cell door shut] Sucker! All right, lady. Give me five minutes to do the paperwork and you’ll be outta here.
Gumball, Darwin, Anais and Richard: Yay!
Nicole: [Rolls up her sleeve] Five minutes is all I need. [Punches her fist into her palm, getting ready to beat Sal up]
[Sal has a very nervous look on his face as the episode ends]
