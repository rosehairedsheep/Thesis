The Battle for the Remote Commences
[Episode starts with Gumball, Darwin, and Anais sitting at the table, while Nicole is in the kitchen]
Gumball: Tonight is going to be awesome! I can't believe they're going to show it!
Darwin: TV is finally gonna acknowledge our existence!
Anais: What are you talking about?
Darwin: Only "Cutie Pets."
Gumball: The number one pet show on TV.
Darwin: They're gonna show this photo! [Holds up photo of Gumball and Darwin running in the rain with puppy eyes]
Anais: Pets? I thought you preferred "animal companion."
Darwin: Aw, who cares about moral principles? This is TV we're talking about!
Nicole: I'm pretty excited too! "Win or Don't Win" is calling tonight. All I have to do is answer one question and I'll win a new microwave!
Gumball: What's wrong with our microwave?
[Nicole places a flower in front of the microwave; the flower burns and shrivels to a pile of ashes. Gumball, Darwin, and Anais chatter in agreement]
Anais: Well, I can't wait to watch Daisy tonight. You're going to meet Sally the Snake, aren't you, Daisy? [Imitates Daisy] Yes, I am.
Gumball, Darwin, Anais, and Nicole: Ahh... I can't wait till eight.
[Everyone looks at each other in sudden realization of their situation, in an awkward silence]
Gumball: Well, then I guess it's whoever gets to the remote first!
[Everyone begins frantically wolfing their breakfast down. They all finish at the same time. They rush for the table where the remote usually is, climbing and tripping over each other. Richard is shown sitting on the couch with bloodshot eyes]
Richard : Upupupupup! I've been up all night saving my seat for... El gran final de "La Casa de las Lágrimas" [Translates to: The grand finale of "La Casa de las Lágrimas," which in turn translates to "The House of Tears"] ...and just to make sure no one changes the channel, I've hidden the remote! Ahaha— [snores]
[Everyone except Richard erupts into a raging argument, explaining why they should get to watch the TV]
Anais: Can I please watch Daisy?
[They all stop to yell at Anais]
Gumball, Darwin, Nicole and Richard: No!
[They begin arguing again]
Darwin: This face was made for TV!
Nicole: I don't want to grow a third arm next time I make a cup of coffee!
Anais: I wish I had enough money to buy my own remote!
[Anais goes to her room; Nicole gets an idea, shown by the expression on her face: shocked or awestruck]
Nicole: Okay, well, you know what? I'm going... grocery shopping!
[Nicole runs out of the house]
Gumball: Hey! We're not done with you yet!
Darwin: Wake up!
[They repeatedly slap his cheeks attempting to wake him up, to no avail]
Gumball: Wait a minute. We don't need the remote. We can change the channel... on the TV.
Darwin: You mean get up from the sofa and change it manually, like they did in ancient times when people weren't lazy? That sounds a little extreme, man!
[Camera zooms out]
The Mission
[Camera shows Gumball's face zoomed in; Gumball is in a space mission-like mission]
Gumball: Check-check. Okay, control, I'm going in.
Darwin: Okay. Ksh. How you feeling?
Gumball: To be honest, I'm feeling pretty lazy.
Darwin: Keep going. You're doing great.
Gumball: Something's happening. It's like no one's ever walked here before. I...I can't do it. I'm gonna turn around.
Darwin: No. You've got to keep going. You've passed the Christmas carpet stain. There won't be enough willpower to send you back.
Gumball: Okay, I'll try. Gravity pulling me down. I'm not gonna make it. I...can't...be...bothered... [Passes out]
Darwin: Abort the mission! I repeat, abort the mission!
After the Mission
Gumball: I'm sorry buddy, but it wasn't possible. Now I know why remotes were invented. [coughs]
Darwin: Here. Take this. It'll make you feel better.
[Darwin snaps a chocolate bar in half to wake him up]
Richard: [suddenly wakes up] Did I hear chocolate?
Gumball: Yes, and we'll give you some, WHEN YOU TELL US WHERE THE REMOTE IS!
Richard: No, never!
Gumball: Really? Not even for the chocolate choo-choo train? Ch-ch-ch-ch-choo-choo! Ch-ch-ch-ch-choo-choo!
[Richard is tempting to grab it with his mouth. The phone rings; they stop]
Anais: I'll get it!
[Gumball, Darwin, and Richard resume]
Nicole: Anais, I need you to tell me what brand the TV is.
Anais: Okay, but does this mean I can watch Daisy tonight?
Nicole: No. It means you won't be grounded for six months.
Anais: WHAT? But I'm four! That's like one eighth of my life!
Nicole: Then you don't want to spend it locked up in your bedroom.
Anais: Ugh! Fine!
[Scene cuts back to Richard tempting to get the chocolate bar]
Darwin: Bing-bong! The train will not be stopping at this mouth.
Richard: Okay! Okay! Just give me the chocolate and I'll tell you!
Gumball and Darwin: Yes!
Richard: [Swallows chocolate bar] But in the form of a riddle. The remote is in the valley betwixt two hills. Its name begins with a "B," ends with two "T"s, and has "U" in the middle. AND YOU'LL NEVER FIND IT! [Laughs and falls asleep]
Darwin: Oh, I know this one! I know this one!
[Gumball and Darwin go to Butt Valley: a valley with two hills]
Gumball: Dude, there's no remote here.
Darwin: Wait a minute. B-U-T-T. It's under his butt, isn't it? [Facepalms several times]
Back at Home
[Scene cuts back to Richard snoring at the house; Gumball makes Richard lean over]
Gumball: I got him! Get the remote!
[It is shown that the remote has been lost, and that there is a hole]
Richard: Aah! Where is it? I've been sitting on it all day long!
Gumball: There's only one person that could have taken it.
Darwin: Yeah, you! Because it definitely wasn't me! [Shouts as he sprays out saliva] Where did you put it?! Where did you put it?! Where did you put it?!
Gumball: Dude, say it, don't spray it!
[Richard grabs Darwin; they argue]
Gumball: Chill everybody, I meant Anais. It could only be Anais.
Darwin: Oh! 'Cause we both want to watch the same thing. Yeah, right.
Richard: Get her!
[They bust the door into the children's room]
Gumball, Darwin and Richard: Where's the remote?!
Anais: What remote?
Gumball: Right.
[They start looking for the remote, messing up the bedroom in the process]
Anais: What are you doing?!
Gumball: Look! The scissors she used to cut a hole in the sofa!
Anais: What are you talking about?!
Gumball: TELL US WHERE IT IS! [Grabs Daisy] Or Daisy won't have to worry about headaches ever again.
Anais: No, please wait! [Reveals remote] Here it is. I'm sorry.
[Gumball, Darwin and Richard smile]
Anais: But I just want you to know, I AM DOING THIS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD! [Smashes remote]
Gumball, Darwin and Richard: Noooooooooooooooooooo-!
Gumball: All right, Daisy's getting it.
Anais: No. There's another.
Gumball: Another what?
Anais: Another remote. Mom went downtown to buy one.
Richard: It's twenty to eight!
Gumball, Darwin and Richard: We need to get that remote!
Gumball: Thanks for the tip.
[Gumball, Darwin, and Richard run away]
Anais: Daisy!
Gumball: [Throws Daisy to Anais] Oh yeah. [Runs back] Wait. You're not coming?
Anais: I don't care about your stupid TV anymore! All I need is my Daisy.
At the Mall
[Camera fades to the mall, then cuts into the elevator]
Nicole: Gotcha.
[Ancient Chinese music begins playing. Gumball, Richard and Darwin are waiting for her at the car. Nicole runs away]
Richard: Get her!
[Gumball, Darwin, and Richard chase her. After she bounces off a car, Nicole grabs Richard and uses him to knock Gumball off; she uses Darwin to hinder Richard. She fights Gumball, who comes back, and spins him; Richard grabs Nicole]
Richard: Get the remote!
[Gumball tries to get the remote, but Nicole jumps away from his head and gets into the car; Darwin jumps onscreen, but he knocks Richard. Nicole laughs, but can't get the car keys from her shirt pockets]
Gumball: [holding the keys outside the window] Looking for these?
[Richard breaks the window with his fist, grabs the remote, and laughs. He runs away with Gumball and Darwin chasing him. Once he realizes this, he runs faster, but accidentally slams his head against a sign that says "MIND YOUR HEAD."]
Gumball: Thank you!
[Gumball and Darwin chuckle and run away; Richard sleeps, but he gets up all of a sudden]
Richard: No! ¡Tengo que saber si Consuela sobrevive a la operación! [Translates to: I have to know if Consuela survives the medical operation!]
[Nicole chases Gumball and Darwin]
Gumball: She's gaining on us!
[Gumball and Darwin scream; they bump into Richard, who grabs the remote]
Nicole: That remote is mine!
Richard: Then come and get it!
[Nicole runs up to him and kicks the remote away from his shirtpocket, causing the remote to fly in the air; Nicole and Richard both hinder each other and struggle to get the remote. Nicole clenches Richard's nipple, causing him to release it; Nicole fights Gumball, Darwin, and Richard for the remote. She knocks them all down, and runs toward the edge of the parking lot. Principal Brown's car gets in the way; Nicole goes through the car, Gumball and Darwin jumps over the hood of the car, and Richard simply fails to go through due to his body. Nicole runs and jumps away from the edge of the parking lot onto the top of another parking lot. Gumball and Darwin runs toward the edge also, but they realize the risk of doing Nicole's task]
Gumball: Let's take the stairs.
[They go to take the stairs; Richard carelessly jumps off the edge, bumps into the wall, and falls. Nicole is still running; Gumball and Darwin open the door]
Gumball: She's getting away!
[Nicole laughs, but finds that the gate of the parking lot is closing]
Gumball: If you leave without paying, you're setting a bad example for your children!
Nicole: I can't find the right change! [Tries to find change] Oh no. Come on. Aah! [bumps into the gate]
Gumball: Thank you for being a responsible citizen.
[Nicole sighs]
At Home
[Scene cuts to the house, with Gumball and Darwin running]
Gumball: Come on dude. "Cutie Pets" starts in five minutes.
[Richard jumps on them]
Richard ¡Paren! ¡"La Casa de las Lágrimas" comienza en cinco minutos! [Translates to: Stop! "La Casa de las Lágrimas" starts in 5 minutes!]
[Richard seizes the remote; Nicole runs on-screen]
Nicole: Oh no, it doesn't! "Win Or Don't Win" does!
[They fight again, arguing to get the remote]
Darwin: I'm a celebrity!
Gumball: Wait a minute!
[Gumball takes it away from them]
Richard: That's mine hey...
Gumball: This isn't a TV remote...
[As Gumball presses the buttons on the remote, Gary's garage door crushes his car]
Gary: Why?! My car!
Gumball: Dag-nabbit! It's for a garage door! What did you buy this for?!
Nicole: What? It's the one Anais told me to get.
Gumball: Why would Anais tell you to buy the wrong... remote? She planned this whole thing from the start.
[Gumball flashes back]
Gumball: First, she gave Mom the idea to buy a new remote.
Anais: I wish I had enough money to buy my own remote!
Nicole: So when I called, she must have given me the name of a garage door opener.
Anais: Fine. Let me have a look... It's a Logikar 2000.
Nicole: Thanks honey.
Richard: She overheard my riddle...
Darwin: I know this one!
Richard: Waited 'til you guys were at Butt Valley, and cut a hole in the sofa so she could take the real remote.
[Anais holds a pair of scissors as she is about to cut a hole under the sofa]
Darwin: And the remote she smashed upstairs must have been a decoy.
[Screen shows the remote Anais gave them was actually a calculator]
[Flashback ends]
Gumball: Which means the real one must still be in the house!
[Nicole tries to open the locked door; they see through the window that Anais is unzipping and opening her Daisy doll, revealing the remote]
Gumball: [gasps] I had it in my hands!
[Flashback returns]
Gumball: Thanks for the tip!
Anais: Daisy!
Gumball: Oh yeah.
Anais: All I need is my Daisy.
[Flashback ends; Anais waits for her Daisy show]
Anais: [flashback voice] I wish I had enough money to buy my own remote. All I need is my Daisy. It's a Logikar 2000. I don't care about your stupid TV anymore!
[The clock shows 8:00.]
TV: Y a continuación, el último episodio de "La Casa de las Lágrimas." [Translates to: And now, the final episode of "La Casa de las Lágrimas"]
[Anais changes the channel to the "Daisy the Donkey Show."]
Daisy the Donkey: Daisy The Donkey! LALALALALA! Daisy The Donkey! LALALALALA!
Richard: Oh, madre mia! [Translates to: Oh my goodness!] [passes out]
Nicole: I feel so proud of her, yet really scared at the same time.
Gumball and Darwin: [Banging the window] Noooooooooooo!
[Anais moves her head left to right trance-like and creepily with the camera zooming in with every "Daisy"]
Daisy the Donkey​​: Daisy, Daisy, Daisy, Daisy, DAISY!
[Episode ends]
