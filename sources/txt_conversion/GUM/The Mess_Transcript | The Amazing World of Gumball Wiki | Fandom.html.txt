No Sleep
[The episode starts with Gumball and Penny talking on the phone]
Penny: So you're sure it's not a problem to babysit my little sister tomorrow?
Gumball: Ah, Penny, please. I'm the most responsible kid I know.
Penny: I agree. Usually when something goes wrong, you're the one responsible.
Gumball: Pfft, come on! I might struggle for, like, half an hour or so, but after I find my footing I— ahh! [Falls off the stool]
Penny: What?
[Gumball tries to get up using a cabinet, but manages to pull it out instead]
Gumball: Uh, nothing, nothing. [Opens a cabinet] So, yeah. I bought all the stuff on the list you gave me: peanuts, almonds, cashews, mold spores...
Penny: That was a list of her allergies.
Gumball: [Upon hearing this, promptly throws what he bought for Polly in the trash] That's what I'm saying! There's none left in the place.
Penny: Okay, so the house is toddler-proofed?
Gumball: Sure is! 
[Camera cuts to Felicity and Billy looking at the fence around the Wattersons' house, as a camera tracks them] 
Gumball: [Off-screen] I can't see any baby breaking in here.
Penny: Okay, but promise you won't stay up all night playing games online, like you always do.
Gumball: Uh, we didn't stay up all night playing games online. We stayed up all night watching other people playing games online whilst talking about what it feels like to play games online.
Penny: [Sighs]
Gumball: All right. I prom—
[Cuts to Gumball and Darwin watching a long video called "Awesome shot!!!!!1" at night with suspenseful music playing in the background]
Darwin: Dude, I told you, it's a troll GIF. It's just looping.
Gumball: Just one more minute...
[Cuts to morning with a rooster crowing in the background]
[In the video, the man shoots the arrow, popping all five balloons as Gumball and Darwin cheer]
Gumball and Darwin: Eyyyy.
Gumball: Totally worth it.
[Doorbell rings]
Gumball: OH, NO! PENNY!
[Gumball and Darwin tiredly open the door and wave to Penny and Polly]
Gumball: Oh, hi.
Penny: [Sighs] You've been up all night, haven't you? Your eyes look like saggy oysters.
Gumball: Oh, we're fine. [Reaches out for Polly] Where is the little peanut?
Polly: [Giggles] I made you a picture! [Shows a drawing of a foot saying "Hi" to Gumball]
Gumball: Aww, thank you! What is it?
Polly: It's Bigfoot!
Gumball: So it is.
Polly: [Hugs Gumball] Hee!
Penny: Okay, we'll be back from the movie at four. Can you manage her till then?
Gumball: [Yawns] Don't worry, I'll take it from here.
Penny: Thanks, Gumball. Bye, Polly! [Walks off]
Polly: Bye!
Gumball: I think everything will be just [He and Darwin fall asleep, blacking out] fiiii...
Polly "Disappears"
[Later in the day: Gumball is putting together something that vaguely resembles a snowman made of meat. When he realizes what he is doing, he screams in fear and inches away]
Darwin: [Off-screen] Gumball, what's happening?!
Gumball: Uh, I don't know, man!
Darwin: [Off-screen] Something's wrong with us! Check our symptoms ​on the Internet!
Gumball: I'm not sure searching online for "meat snowman surprise" would yield the most constructive results! WHERE ARE YOU?!
[Darwin is in the living room with a fat cat wearing heels that looks like Gumball]
Darwin: In the middle of losing my mind, I think.
[A panicking Gumball runs in]
Gumball: Dude! WHERE IS POLLY?!
Darwin: Polly?!
Gumball: Polly?!
Darwin: Polly?!
Gumball: Polly?!
Gumball: [Checks in the oven...] Polly?
Darwin: [...In the trash...] Polly?
Gumball: [...In the fridge...] Polly?
Darwin: [...And in a potato chip bag] Polly!
[They're in their room. Gumball looks at Darwin disbelievingly, then smacks the bag away]
Gumball: We have to find her!
Darwin: [Deliriously] Or we dress me like Polly, her parents take me back with them, I join their family, and they raise me as their daughter. Twenty years later - "Congratulations, Penny's sister, you're gonna be a mother!"
Gumball: ...What?
Darwin: Then I move to the suburbs with Pompadour, my rainbow frog husband, and raise a couple of windmills and... [Gumball slaps him and he comes to his senses] Yeah! We need to find her!
[The brothers go outside, walking drowsily]
Darwin: Should we just order a cab?
Gumball: Yeah, that should help us cover a little bit more of the neighborhood.
[The brothers fix their postures. Gumball and Darwin attempt to order a cab but they black out just as it is ordered]
Finding Polly
[The brothers wake up in an upside-down police car. They notice and fall down from their seats. They shout in fear as they realize what is going on]
Gumball: Officer, do something! Please do something!
[The car goes through a traffic jam, and somehow makes it out of there in one piece]
Darwin: Officer, wake up!
Donut Sheriff: Uh... Agh! Wh... Why did you guys wake me up?!
Gumball: [Dispels all previous traces of fear] Because we're in a car sliding down the road upside-down.
Donut Sheriff: Well, thanks. Now I have to deal with two traumatic crashes rather than one!
Gumball: What do you mean?
[The car crashes into a lamp post. Gumball and Darwin remove a window and pull the sheriff out]
Gumball: What is happening here, man?! It's like our lives [As he says the following lines, the picture glitches out] are being editededitededited by a thirteen-year old [Glitches out] vlogger or something. One minute, we're here [High-pitched] and the next thing we know, we're like "Raaaaaaaa!" and two minutes later we're like "Wooyooyooyooyoo!" and that leaves me completely like [Groaning]. You know what I mean?
Darwin: I'm not sure. But it seems like every time we blink, time skips forward. So I say we don't close our eyes until we find Polly.
Gumball: I agree. [His phone vibrates, pulls it out] "Your cab is arriving."
Mugging a Corncob
[...But when it does, it crashes into the police car, which totals both in a big explosion which makes Gumball and Darwin close their eyes. When they wake up, Gumball is punching Jeff and Darwin trying to stop him]
Darwin: No, stop it, stop it!!! Stop! No, stop it! Stop!
Gumball: WHAT?!!
Darwin: I think we already got what we wanted...
Gumball: [Referring to the briefcase Darwin is holding] Polly's in there?
[Money comes out of the case. Shocked, both boys shout]
Gumball: Where is she?
Darwin: More importantly, what do we do about him?!
Gumball: But Polly—
Darwin: But innocent mugging victim!
Gumball: Okay, okay! We, uh, we... we... we make it look like it happened through natural causes!
Darwin: What? How?
[Gumball puts a note saying "ExERcise BLows"]
Gumball: There, like this.
Darwin: "Exercise blows"?
Gumball: ...Yeah, maybe not. Oh, I know! We'll make it look like an accident!
[results are shown: Jeff is in a canoe, grasping an oar as Gumball looks impressively and Darwin concerned]
Gumball: There! A canoe accident. ...No, that's not quite right. ...Oh!
[Gumball puts on a radio and poses Jeff; he falls over]
Gumball: This isn't working! What do we do?!
[Gumball punches Jeff, reviving him. Both boys shriek in fear as Jeff comes towards them, causing them to black out again, and wake up at a fair, being roared at by Tina. Gumball interprets this as a threat]
The "Fight"
Gumball: OH YEAH, TINA?! WELL, IF THAT'S THE WAY IT IS, GET READY FOR A TASTE OF MY... Uh... [Checks his weapon] MY BULLFROG'S HARP!!!!!
Tina: [Roars]
Gumball: [using his toy as a slingshot] BACK OFF!!!!!
Darwin: Dude, why are you so angry?!
Gumball: I DUNNO!!! I'M IRRATIONALLY ANGRY!!!!! [Grunts]
Tina: [Roars]
Gumball: COME AND GET IT, YOU HALLOWEEN TURKEY!!!!!
Tina: [Roars]
[Gumball blacks out again]
The Explanation
[Both boys wake up at their house... now looking a tad bit worse for wear]
Patrick: I have to say, boys, I took you for a bunch of slack-jawed buffoons, but... You did a really good job!
[Both boys look at each other, worried. After a bit of suspense, Polly's revealed to be with them!]
Gumball: Oh, my gosh! [He and Darwin hug Polly] You're aliiiiiive [Realizes Penny's glaring at them] ...ly child? Con...gratulations, sir! She must take after you! Or-Or, you, Mrs. Fitzgerald. It's hard to tell. You look so alike. Are... you related?
[Both Fitzgerald parents are surprised; Penny glares at him again]
Patrick: Polly, say goodbye and get your stuff. Bye, kids!
[Gumball and Darwin wave after Patrick and Judith. Penny stays and grows more suspicious]
Penny: WHAT HAPPENED?!
Gumball: Uh, nothing! Why would you say that?
[Penny angrily points to Gumball's black eye, the blue cat dressed up as Gumball, Darwin's bruised lips, the snowman made of meat, and the stuffed bullfrog playing a harp]
Gumball: Okay, okay. We lost her.
Penny: Then what happened?!
Gumball: That's the thing. We don't really know.
Polly: I do. It started when I arrived...
[Flashbacks to when Penny drops off Polly to Gumball and Darwin]
Penny: Thanks, Gumball. Bye, Polly!
Polly: Bye!
Gumball: I think everything will be just [He and Darwin fall asleep] fine...
[Gumball places Polly on the couch]
Gumball: Would you like some orange juice?
Polly: Uh-huh!
[Gumball tiredly walks to the fridge and opens it. Before he gets the orange juice, the fridge chills him and he starts singing while building a snowman made of meat from the fridge]
Gumball: Hey! Jingle dance! Jingle dance! Jingle in your face! Chilling out like sauerkraut who just caught himself a trout! Hey! Jingle dance! Jingle dance! Jingle in your face! Always...
[Gumball continues singing as Polly confusedly stares at him. She then hears Darwin and walks outside]
Darwin: Gumball! Put some clothes on! The neighbors can see you!
[Darwin puts pants on a blue cat outside, who then proceeds to scratch Darwin's face, causing him to scream and jump through the window. Polly follows Darwin inside]
[Flashback ends]
Gumball: Aah! 
[The blue cat walks out of the house] 
Gumball: Well, on the upside, that cat certainly knows how to work those heels, heh...
Penny: [Sighs] Okay, what happened next?
Polly: Then they started harmonizing...
[Flashbacks to Gumball and Darwin harmonizing]
Gumball: La la la la laaa
Gumball: La laaa Darwin: La la laaa
Darwin: La la laaa Gumball: La laaa 
Gumball and Darwin: La la laaa la la laaa
[Gumball and Darwin continue harmonizing]
Polly: That went on for about twenty minutes before I got bored and went to the backyard. Then when I came back, they were gone, so I went outside.
[Polly goes outside to meet Gumball and Darwin trying to order a cab while a police officer shows up]
Donut Sheriff: Hey! What's going on here? Jaywalking, huh?
[Gumball and Darwin climb into the police car]
Donut Sheriff: What the... Hey!
Gumball: Hey do you have any mints or water?
Donut Sheriff: What?! Who do you think I am?!
Darwin: Uh, [Points to Doughnut Sheriff's badge] a one-star driver by the looks of it.
Gumball: Yeah, not surprising when you see the state of the back seat. Smells like a turtle tank in here.
Donut Sheriff: Right. I'm taking you two downtown. Maybe a night in the cells will improve your attitude.
[Siren starts as the police car drives off]
Gumball: Dude, this tune blows. There's no lyrics. Do you mind if I just...
[Gumball tries to "change stations" while the Doughnut Sheriff tries to stop him]
Donut Sheriff: What the— stop it!
Gumball: I'm just changing stations!
[Gumball fiddles with the radio, causing random conversations to come from it]
Radio: One seven, one seven. X-ray Charlie, X-ray Charlie. One seven, one seven.
Donut Sheriff: Stop it!
[The police car starts swerving, flips upside down, hits a fire hydrant and proceeds to slides down the road]
Radio: Charlie, Charlie, Charlie. One seven, one seven. X-ray, X-ray, X-ray, X-ray. One seven, one seven.
[The police car continues making noises while Polly watches. Flashback ends]
Gumball: Mm, did they have to call the fire department too? 'Cause that song sounds lit! No? Okay.
Penny: What happened next, Polly?
Polly: Well, they went through town looking for me.
[Flashbacks to when Gumball and Darwin look for Polly in town]
Gumball: Polly!
Darwin: Polly!
[Jeff walks past, smells his breath, and eats some mints. However, he starts choking on one and tries telling Gumball to help him]
Gumball: Oh, I-I know what to do!
[Gumball attempts to do the Heimlich maneuver on Jeff, but drops him on a trash can]
Darwin: That's not how you do it.
Gumball: Well, just... You do it, then.
Darwin: [Walks to Jeff] Okay, I would like you to breathe in [Inhales] and breathe out. [Exhales]
[Jeff continues choking]
Darwin: No, no, no. Breathe in. [Inhales] Breathe out. [Exhales] Breathe in. [Inhales] Breathe out. [Exhales]
[Jeff coughs out the mint and faints]
Darwin: There! He's relaxed now.
Polly: You need to give him CPR.
Gumball and Darwin: Ahh, thank you, Polly.
[Darwin tries giving CPR to Jeff's suitcase while Gumball tries to give CPR to Jeff by repeatedly punching his chest. Flashback ends]
Gumball: Wait, you were following us the whole time?
Penny: No, Polly was using the Force to appear to you as a hologram.
Gumball: Right, I’m sure there’s an explanation for that too.
Penny: [Turns into minotaur form] OF COURSE SHE WAS WITH YOU!!!!!
Gumball: Wha-what happened after that guy worked up and attacked us?
Polly: [Flashback] He didn’t attack you, he hugged you!
Jeff: [Hugs the boys] Oh, thank you so much, you saved my life! Anything, ask me for anything you like and I’ll buy it for you!
Gumball: I would like the golden twinkle in an old man’s eye as he holds his infant granddaughter.
Jeff: What?
Gumball: Okay, then I’d like the power to lay eggs.
Polly: [Voic-eover] That went on for a while, but you finally settled for a... [Flashback ends] stuffed bullfrog that plays the harp.
Darwin: Okay, but what about the fight with Tina?
Polly: That happened when you bumped into a charity worker who asked if you wanted to save a child. They only wanted a couple of dollars but apparently you decided to go above and beyond.
[Flashbacks to when Gumball and Darwin are at the charity fair. Sarah, Hot Dog Guy, Teri, Leslie and Tina are lined up for a kissing booth, with Tina in front]
Gumball: This is all for you, Polly. Okay, Tina, let's get on with it. [Puckers]
Tina: Actually, I'm in line for Darwin.
Gumball: Uh uh uh, sorry, but I'm the only one who's allowed to kiss Darwin. That's in the rulebook. [Displays two waffles with staples sticking them together] Right here.
Tina: That's not a rulebook. That's two potato waffles stapled together.
Gumball: Well if that's how it is then just beat it!
Tina: Then I want my money back.
Gumball: It says on waffle two, no refunds!
Tina: [Roars]
Gumball: COME AND GET IT, YOU HALLOWEEN TURKEY!!!!!
[Gumball hits himself with the stick he was assaulting Tina with and falls down. Tina batts her eyes at at Darwin and goes closer to him as he gasps. The flashback ends]
Gumball: Okay, that explains Darwin's lips but not how we ended up back here.
Polly: Oh, we took the bus.
Gumball: Huh. [Glances at Darwin]
Polly: [Hugs Gumball] Goodbye, now!
[Polly leaves, leaving only Gumball, Penny and Darwin at the door. Gumball yawns]
Gumball: Well, now if you excuse us, I think it's best if we get some sleep and-
Penny: Oh, I don't think so. Not before I'm done screaming at you! I COUNTED ON YOU, YOU GLUTE LORD! YOU GOOF WIZARD! YOU DORK PILOT! YOU DOPE SANDWICH! YOU...FOOL...TACO! YOU MEAT MUFFIN...
[Gumball and Darwin look at each other and close their eyes. They wake up at night, and Penny is still there, exhaustedly screaming at Gumball]
Penny: ...slack jawed slime nugget. You- [Sighs] I think that's all I've got.
Gumball: Sorry. Do you forgive me?
Penny: [Inhales sharply] I'll think about it. [Storms off]
[Gumball and Darwin walk inside and close the door]
Gumball: Yeah, to be honest, I was a little disappointed with the bus ending part.
Darwin: Yeah, I expected more.
Gumball: Eh, anyway, nighty night, dude.
[The bus is revealed to have crashed on top of the Watterson's house. Episode ends]
