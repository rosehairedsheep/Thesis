Gumball and Darwin part 2
[The scene transitions back to the school]
Mister Small​​​: Step two! We need to channel your destructive energy into something creative. Like painting!
Gumball and Darwin: Oh, okay!
Mister Small​​​: When you think about painting, do you think about something like this? [points to a framed portrait of Mr. Robinson wearing a wig]
Gumball and Darwin: Yeah!
Mister Small​​​: Well... YOU'RE WRONG! [slams the painting onto the floor and begins to hit it with a baseball bat] This is not painting! This is not painting! This! Is! Not! Painting! [drops a lit match onto the now destroyed painting] Burn! You relic of convention! [stomps out the fire, then holds up a paint can] Who wants to go first?
Gumball: [enthusiastically] Me! Me, me, me! Pick me!
[Mr. Small throws paint all over him]
Mister Small​​​: The world is your canvas; now be the brush!
[Gumball's eyes open and get burnt by the paint]
Gumball: [screams] My eyes! It burns! [smashes into the walls crying and then slips]
Mister Small​​​: Not bad. Your turn Darwin. [dumps paint on Darwin]
Darwin: [screams with high-pitch] It burns!
Nicole part 2
[The scene goes back to the Watterson residence, Nicole is furiously scrubbing the kitchen floor]
Nicole: Whew! So, that's the whole house washed, the car triple waxed, I've bleached the fruit, alphabetized the fridge and all its contents, and I've polished my cleaning products. Five hours before anyone gets home. [begins to glance around, then knocks over a vase] Whoops! Oh, how silly of me, well I guess I'll have to clean that up. Oh, there goes another one! Oh, what am I like?

Gumball and Darwin part 3
[The scene transitions to the school again. Mister Small, Gumball, and Darwin are all wearing interpretive dance costumes]
Mister Small​​​: Step three. Interpretive Dance.
Gumball: What is interpretative dance?
Mister Small​​​: It's where you channel your emotions through body moves!
Gumball: That sounds kinda' silly.
Mister Small​​​: [offended] Silly? You think this is silly? [he begins his interpretive dance] Mommy! Why must you work so much? Daddy, arise from your slumber, and appreciate me... I'm troubled! Troubled and loooosst... Don't hate me, because I'm beautiful! Sticks and stones can break; my bones. I will be reborn! Like a phoenix. [holds the 'x' in phoenix for a long time]
Gumball: Yep. That was kinda' silly.
Darwin: [with teary eyes] I thought it was beautiful!
Mister Small​​​: Now, it's your turn. Come on Gumball!
Gumball: Alright. [he does a simplistic dance]
Darwin: [still teary eyed] Whoa! Amazing Gumball!
Mister Small​​​: Now, pretend you're a hungry crab.
[Gumball does a crab walk]
Mister Small​​​: Hungrier!
[Gumball gets scared and begins to hold his stomach]

[Richard signs the paper]
Receptionist: And here's your pink slip.
Richard: What does that mean?
Receptionist: It means you're seven hours and fifty-nine minutes late, and you're fired.

Mister Small​​​: Destroy this negative feeling!
[Gumball comes forth and lets out a battle cry before smashing the board to no avail]
Mister Small​​​: Again! [Gumball tries again] Again! [Gumball tries again] No, no... [impatiently] Come on! Destroy those inhibitions!
Gumball: [in pain] I'm trying!
Darwin: Don't worry buddy, I'll help you! [shrieks and runs towards the board with a bat]
Mister Small​​​: Wha- [gets scared and hides in the closet]
Darwin: Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo inhibitions! [catches breath] Shooooo! We did it Mr. Small!
[Mr. Small looks relieved and walks back over to them]

[Gumball and Darwin walk in]
Gumball: Hi mom!
Nicole: Oh, hi kids. How was your day?
Darwin: We had loads of fun!

Nicole: Smash stuff?! That sounds interesting!
[Anais and Principal Brown are standing outside the door]
Nigel Brown: So, let's see what positive effect my program has had on your barbaric family.
Anais: [angrily] Principal Brown! Can I just say-
Nigel Brown: Oop! There's nothing to worry about sweetie. Now, say hello to your all-new, healthy, responsible family!
[Principal Brown opens the front door and presents the new and improved Wattersons, all of whom are acting completely out of their minds]
Nigel Brown: What is going on here?! [Everybody freezes] You've made no progress whatsoever!
[Everyone begins blaming each other except Anais]
Anais: [loudly] Excuse me! [Everyone all stops arguing] If you'd listened for a second, you'd have known I never wanted anyone's change.
Nicole: But, I thought you were unhappy honey! That painting?
Anais: That painting says, "I love my family" exactly as they are.
[Anais giggles happily and skips over to Richard, who rubs her head lovingly]
Richard: Does that mean I don't have to go back to work?
Anais: Uh huh.
Richard: Yes! [falls asleep]
Anais: Can I play with you guys now?
Nicole: Of course, there you go honey. [hands a vase to Anais]
Anais: Hai-yah! [smashes it on the floor, everyone goes crazy again]
Nigel Brown: Well, good job everyone... I'll let myself out. [leaves but soon comes back] Oh, and you'll go back to your normal class tomorr- [Darwin dumps paint on him]
Darwin: Be the brush!
Nigel Brown: It burns...
