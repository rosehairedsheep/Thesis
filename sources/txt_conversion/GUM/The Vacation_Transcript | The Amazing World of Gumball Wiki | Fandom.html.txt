Going Camping
[The episode opens with the Wattersons in their car as Nicole drives along a desert road]
Gumball: Some say it was a military experiment gone wrong. They say he roams the desert, feeding off lost strangers. They say he has the body of a cougar, the wings of a bat, and the head… of a duck!
[Darwin, Anais, and Richard scream; Richard cries]
Nicole: Guys, guys, guys! Please save the campfire stories for the campfire. You’re going to give him nightmares.
[The kids giggles]
Anais: Okay, my turn! [Holds a flashlight under her face] There was once an old--
[Richard tries to toast a marshmallow in the light]
Anais: Dad, we’ve been over this. It’s not a real fire.
Richard: [Mockingly] "Dad, we’ve been over this, neh, neh, neh."
Anais: There was once a pickup truck following a man for hours and hours down an empty highway. The man slowed down to let the truck overtake him. When the truck pulled level, the window rolled down and the man realized... the truck had no driver!
[Everyone screams, startling Nicole. They laugh, and she looks at them annoyed]
Richard: Okay! I’ve got one! There was once a very hungry hitchhiker who was lost at night. He saw some light coming in from a house, so he walked in but found it deserted except for one fridge. He slowly opened the door and realized... the fridge was empty! [Screams in horror]
Gumball: Dad, that was about as scary as being chased by a swarm of butterflies.
Anais: Yeah, or a street gang of kittens.
Richard: Hmph!
Darwin: Don’t worry, Mr. Dad. Grown-ups can’t tell scary stories.
Nicole: Oh, really? Then what about the tale of the sixteen hour shift. With no paid overtime?!
Anais: Mom, face it. You can’t tell a horror story.
Nicole: Yeah? Well, maybe when you kids grow up, you’ll know how scary financial pressures can be.
Darwin: Don’t worry Mrs. Mom. It’s not your fault you’re boring. It’s because you’re old.
Nicole: [Angry and determined] Richard, flashlight!
[Richard shines the flashlight in Nicole's face]
Nicole: Higher, that’s not a flattering angle. [Begins story] In a car driving through the desert, just like this one, there was a family just like ours.
Richard: [Screams]
Nicole: Richard, that’s not the scary bit. They were heading on a camping trip when they broke down in the middle of nowhere.
[The kids literally sink into the back seat]
Nicole: A strange old man living in a derelict gas station helped them out and suggested they stay for dinner, and as he grinned at them with a toothless smile, they realized that the main course... WAS THEM!
[Everyone screams]
Nicole: Now, we’d better hope we don’t break down.
[The engine sputters and dies, and the car rolls to a stop. Everyone screams]
Nicole: Boo-yah! Who’s boring now?
[The Wattersons sigh with relief and laugh]
Anais: You really nailed it with the fake breakdown. I wish I was still wearing diapers.
Nicole: Okay. Let’s get back on the road.
[Nicole turns the key, but the car refuses to start]
Nicole: So, you’re gonna laugh at this.
[Everyone screams]
Nicole: Oh, calm down!
Darwin: But it’s just like in the story!
Gumball: Some toothless old guy’s gonna eat my brain!
Nicole: Gumball, please calm down. I’m sure it’s nothing.
[Nicole opens the front hood only to see molten pink marshmallows]
Nicole: Richard, why is the engine compartment full of marshmallows?
Richard: Nicole, I think you mean the front trunk.
[Nicole angrily slams the front hood several times]
Nicole: Okay. This is not going to ruin our family outing.
Roadside Assistance
[Nicole takes out a map]
Nicole: Here. There’s a garage a mile north. Richard, go get help.
[Richard is behind the car, trying to cook a marshmallow with the sunlight reflecting off the window]
Richard: Okay. I’ll go when my marshmallow’s done.
[Nicole stares at him with flaming eyes, burning his marshmallow]
Richard: [Yelps] Alright!
Nicole: [Happily] Thank you, honey.
Richard: Aww, I’m supposed to be on vacation, you know.
Nicole: Richard, you don’t have a job, you’re always on vacation.
Richard: Ohhh...
[After many hours, everyone is dehydrated, and Richard is seen crawling to the car]
Gumball: [Raspy] Dad, did you find a mechanic?
Richard: [Raspy] No. I think there’s something wrong with the compass.
Nicole: [Raspy] Richard, show me that.
[Richard shakily holds up a pocket watch]
Nicole: It’s a watch. You've been following it in a circle for twelve hours.
Richard: [Attempts to cry] I’m so dehydrated I can’t even cry!
Darwin: [Raspy] It’s okay, the sun’s going down. It’ll be dark soon.
Gumball: [Gasps] Just in time to get eaten alive.
[An old man shows up at the car window. The kids scream, and their appearance returns to normal]
Scary Old Man: Long way from home, ain’t ya? [He laughs, revealing that he has only one tooth]
Darwin: Oh, it’s okay! He’s not toothless.
Nicole: Thank you, sir, but we have roadside assistance. I’ll just use my cell.
Scary Old Man: You can try calling for help, but you won’t get none. There’s no signal here.
Nicole: [Laughs] Please excuse me for a second. [Beats her head against the steering wheel several times, blaring the horn unintentionally] I don’t suppose you could help us, could you?
Scary Old Man: Sure, but we better go soon. We don’t want to miss dinner!
[The man laughs again, only this time, his only tooth falls out of his mouth]
Darwin: Okay, he’s toothless now. Time to panic.
[The kids scream, and the scene transitions to the man pushing their car]
Nicole: Kids, stop staring at him!
Gumball: But Mom, it’s the guy from the story.
Nicole: Oh, don’t be silly. Thank you again, sir, this is very kind of you.
Scary Old Man: Don’t worry about me. I’m just working up my appetite. [Starts laughing through his gums]
Darwin: We’re being pushed to our doom!
Gumball: Really, really slowly.
Nicole: Look, just because he matches the story I made up doesn't mean he’s a psycho, even if he is obviously, you know, dentally challenged. And, anyway, I’d be very surprised if we ended up in a derelict gas sta-- [Notices that they have reached a derelict gas station, their mouths hang open in shock] Oh. Whaddya know?
Scary Old Man: Here we are! Your final destination.
Gumball: Really? He lives in a gas station? [Starts frantically moving his arms] Come on!
Nicole: It’s just an assassination-- [Catches herself midsentence] obliteration-- an extermination-- [Sighs] I mean a coincidence. How 'bout you guys just go stretch your legs?
Dinner Reservations
[Cuts to Gumball and Darwin walking to the derelict gas station.]
Darwin: I don’t like this, dude.
Gumball: Me neither. We should watch our backs.
[Their eyes move to their backs]
Darwin: That’s much better.
[They walk to the gas station and run into a stuffed fox. They scream as they look around at skulls and a stuffed badger]
Gumball: [to the badger] That one looks like it’s angry at both of us at the same time!
[A woman appears at the front door, seemingly dead]
Gumball: He stuffed all of his animals, and his mom!
Scary Old Woman: [Suddenly raises her arms] WELLL--
[Gumball and Darwin run away screaming]
Scary Old Woman: [Clasps her hands together] ...come!
[Gumball and Darwin run into the car]
Gumball: MOM, WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE NOW!
Nicole: Yes, about that. Apparently the engine is... [To Richard] caramelized.
Richard: [Sighs contently] Caramelized. [Notices Nicole's glare, whimpers, then continues thinking about food] Mmmm.
Nicole: [Sighs] He can’t fix it. We’re stuck here. But the good news is, he says he’ll have us for dinner.
[Gumball and Darwin open their mouths as if they're screaming]
Nicole: Can you guys stop screaming every five minutes?
Gumball: [Lowers car window, revealing they aren't truly screaming] Actually, we’re doing a silent scream. We need to save our voices for when he eats us!
Anais: You guys are being ridiculous, scaring yourselves with narrow-minded assumptions about country people.
Scary Old Man: [picks Anais up by the head] Big brain for such a small thing. I like that.
Anais: [Zooms into car] WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE NOW!
Nicole: [Furiously] Alright, that’s it! I only get five days off a year! We already wasted Christmas when you [To Richard] decorated the house with whipped cream instead of fake snow.
[A flashback begins. It's Christmas. Nicole enters the house]
Nicole: Merry Christmas- whooaa!
[Nicole slips and falls unconscious]
Richard: [To Anais] Uh, how much cream did you eat?
[End of flash back]
Nicole: Then there was the Fourth of July.
[Flash back starts]
Nicole: [Richard lights a firework] Be careful, Richard.
[The firework flies up and falls down in their neighbors' backyard]
[End of flash back]
Nicole: Then your mother’s visit.
[Flash back starts again with Nicole driving Granny Jojo]
Granny Jojo: After you drop me at the mall, go to the grocery store and buy me a melon, not too hard, not too soft. Then pick me up at two-thirty, don’t be late. I have a three PM appointment at the beauty parlor. And by the looks of you, you could do with an appointment yourself. [Nicole gets very annoyed] Then you need to collect my...
[End of flash back]
Nicole: And let’s not forget Halloween.
[Flash back starts, Richard hides besides the door, Nicole comes out of the bathroom and sees Richard with a werewolf mask]
Richard: Happy Halloween!
Nicole: Aaaah!
[Nicole karate kicks Richard without knowing it’s him, he falls down the stairs]
Nicole: [Gasps] Richard?
Richard: There’s some liquid in my lungs!
[End of flash back]
Nicole: So I am not going to ruin this by listening to your crazy assumptions! We said we were going camping, so we. Are going. Camping!
[Nicole breathes heavily]
Nicole: [Calmly] And it’ll be nice.Thanks for the hospitality, sir. Could you just let us know when dinner’s ready?
Scary Old Man: Oh, don’t worry. You’ll be the first to know.
[Camera zooms in three times on Gumball, Darwin, & Anais. Strings from "Psycho" plays, which is actually Richard scraping marshmallow from the engine with a spoon, and eating it]
Richard: Mmm, caramel.
Night Terror
[The scene changes to their camping tents at night. The scary man stares at them and holds a bloodstained saw]
Nicole: [Singing] If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands!
[Nicole claps her hands. The family is gathered, scared]
Nicole: If you’re happy and you- oh come on, guys! Just because an ugly man lives in a terrifying shack in the middle of nowhere... with his mother... and a bunch of stuffed animals, and, uh, he’s holding a saw and he’s dug five holes that exactly fit our sizes and, uh-
Scary Old Man: It’s dinner time!
[They run away]
Scary Old Woman: Come on, fellas! Let’s eat! [Sees them running away] Who doesn't like pizza?
Nicole: I don’t understand! How can this be happening?! I made it up!
Gumball: Well, next you make up a randomly scary story that comes true, could you please invent a vegetarian psycho who lives near a well-lit police station?!
Scary Old Man: [Shouting] Come back here! [Calmly] Mom made some hot poppers, too.
Gumball: Aaaaah!
[Richard loses fat from running, he becomes remotely unrecognizable]
Richard: We can’t run forever! I’m out of calories!
[He eats marshmallows and becomes fat again]
Richard: And I’m almost out of marshmallows!
Anais: Look! A head in the road!
[Everyone screams]
Anais: No! I mean ahead in the road. A car!
[They signal for the driver]
Unseen Driver: You guys need a ride?
[The camera shows a fridge in the truck compartment, it opens creakily and is empty]
Richard: Ahh! The fridge is empty!
[Everyone runs away screaming]
Driver: [Door opens, showing a small driver] Hm? I guess not.
Scary Old Man: Come back!
Richard: Kids! Kids, where are you?!
[He falls off a cliff and gets stuck between the mountain rocks, then falls down into a mud puddle]
Nicole: Guys. Guys! Where are you?! Guys?
Richard: I’m here!
[Richard comes out of the mud and Nicole kicks him several times, then runs away screaming]
[The scene changes to Gumball]
Scary Old Man: Yello! Time for dinner! I’m ready for ya!
[Camera spins around Gumball]
Gumball: Aah! Leave us alone!
[Gumball walks dizzy]
Gumball: I have been looking around too fast.
[Gumball and Darwin walk into each other, getting black eyes. The scene changes to Anais]
Anais: Mom? Dad? Help me, I’m scared.
Richard: [Choked voice] Don’t worry, baby.
[As he rises out of the mud, Anais grabs him by the arm and swings him against the ground several times]
Anais: [Gasps; notices it's Richard] Dad? Sorry.
Richard: Don’t worry honey, Dad’s here to save you!
[Richard places Anais on his head then starts walking, but she is hit by a branch and falls with a black eye]
Scary Old Man: Why are you guys running from me?! I’m a nice guy. Look.
[He lights a flashlight on his toothless grin, Nicole turns around and two white eyes appear behind her. She starts flailing about trying to fend them off]
Nicole: Get away from my family, you pointy-headed goblin!
[Gumball and Darwin show up from there]
Gumball: Mom, chill out! It’s only us!
Richard: Aaaaah!
[Richard threatens them with aimless punches]
Gumball: Dad, chill out. It’s us.
[Richard embraces them]
Richard: Thank heavens you’re alive.
[Anais appears besides him]
Anais: Me too.
[Richard threatens her too]
Gumball: Dad, chill out. It’s Anais.
Richard: Wait, how did you-
Scary Old Man: Over here!
Gumball: Everybody stop chilling. It’s him.
[Everyone runs and screams]
Scary Old Man: I can’t be having dinner without ya! That’d be just plain rude.
Anais: There, in the distance. A house!
[It turns out to be the gas station again]
Nicole: I don’t understand.
Scary Old Man: Well, you sure got me running there. That’s gonna be a dinner well deserved.
[They fall into the dug holes]
Gumball: Please, I beg you, let us go!
Scary Old Man: Oh, I see you guys found the restroom.
Darwin: Restroom?
Scary Old Man: Well, you know. To “powder your nose”?
Gumball: [Awkwardly] Why are there five of them?
Scary Old Man: One each, for privacy.
Gumball: So you mean you’re not gonna eat our brains?
Scary Old Man: If I was after brains, I wouldn’t go chasing you folks.
[They all laugh]
Gumball: Hey, wait a minute.
[Richard still laughing]
[The scene changes to the next day. The family is in their car]
Nicole: Thank you for your help, sir.
Gumball: We’re really sorry for thinking you were a psycho.
[The man laughs]
Gumball: You have to admit, you guys look like a buncha weirdo mutants. I mean, the stuffed animals, the screaming, the saw, your mom...
Scary Old Man: What did you just say about my mama?
Everyone: Nothing! Bye!
[Their car is taken away by a hoist truck]
Nicole: See? I told you I made it all up.
Darwin: Yeah, we knew there’s no such thing as a haunted pickup truck.
Gumball: Yeah, or a mutant desert monster.
[In the background, a monster exactly like in Gumball’s story grabs the old man and flies away with him. The episode ends]
