Bathroom
[The episode begins with Richard opening a mirror cabinet to get shaving cream. He closes it, and his reflection is shown. He yawns, then inhales deeply. He screams while putting the shaving cream on, then shaves his beard with a hatchet. He splashes hot water on himself, puts cucumber slices on his eyes, then applies a green face mask. He pulls out a nose hair and tears the face mask off. He admires his appearance, then roars]
Richard: [Whispering] You still got it.
[Gumball and Darwin go up to the bathroom sink, grab a toothbrush, and start brushing their teeth]
Richard: Hey, kids. Do I look old to you?
[They put their toothbrushes back]
Gumball: Uh, it's hard to say. I guess that's the good thing about being fat, it fills out all the wrinkles!
Richard: Agh! Well, guess my age.
Gumball and Darwin: Uh...
Darwin: Ooh! Ice Age!
Richard: What?! Are you kidding me? When do you think I was born?
Gumball: I don't know. Fifteen ninety-two?
Richard: What?!
Gumball: Minus a hundred!
Richard: Fourteen ninety-two? That's when America was discovered!
Gumball: Aw, come on! Help us out here. Was it B.C. or A.D.?
Richard: Hmmph!
[Richard turns his back on the boys and leaves the bathroom in a huff. Nicole enters wearing a bathrobe, with a towel wrapped around her head]
Nicole: What did you say to your father?
Gumball: It's not our fault! It was a trap!
Nicole: Ooh, was he fishing for compliments again?
Gumball: Yeah. [Chuckles] And some reality got caught in the net.
Darwin: But you know what it's like, Mrs. Mom. You're pretty old, too.
Nicole: [Giggles] I'm old?
Gumball: Yeah, I mean, you're so old that... You learned to drive on a horse!
[Gumball and Nicole laugh]
Darwin: You're so old that you ate dodo at your first Thanksgiving!
[Laughter from Gumball, Darwin, and Nicole]
Gumball: You're so old, that if you had kids now, they'd be born middle-aged!
[They all laugh]
Darwin: Yeah, I mean you're so old that-
Nicole: ALRIGHT!
[Nicole grabs the sides of her face, pulling the skin taut]
Nicole: No one stays young forever, you know. You'll see how it feels when it happens to you.
[Nicole leaves the room. Gumball and Darwin snicker]
Darwin: Ahh, I think we'll be fine.
Gumball: Yeah, dude. I've been twelve for like... [Gumball counts his fingers] Forever now!
Darwin: I think we can safely say that we'll be young forever, and never [Distorted] cha-a-a-a-ange!
[Darwin covers his mouth]
Gumball: [Gasp] Dude! Are you [Deep voice, everything shakes] ALRIGHT?
Darwin: What's happening?
Gumball: I think [Deep voice, the shaking damages the bathroom] OUR VOICES ARE BROKE!
Darwin: Dude, that was so low you made some of my organs move inside.
Living Room
[Gumball and Darwin are sitting on the couch silently and they look at each other]
Gumball: [Voice cracking] Okay, that was weird, but I'm not gonna let it ruin our day. I'll call Penny and see if she wants to go to the mall.
[Gumball gets off the couch, picks up the phone, dials the number and puts it up to his ear. It rings for a second and then the screen splits to Gumball and Patrick]
Patrick: Fitzgerald residence!
Gumball: [In squeaky voice] Hi, can I speak to Penny [Voice changes to a deep whisper] pleeeease...
Patrick: Is this a joke? 
Gumball: [Still with deep whispery voice] Uh, no.
Patrick: This better be a joke.
Gumball: No, wait, I don't think you understand-
[Patrick's half of the screen gets bigger and bigger, crushing Gumball]
Patrick: I don't think you understand. You think you can call my house and freak us out? You think you've got a scary voice? [In deep, scary voice] This... is a scary voice. Now listen to me. I have a very specific set of skills. Skills I've acquired over a very long career. In real estate. If you never call my daughter again, that... will be the end of it. But if you do, I will look for you. I will find you. And I will build a house around you. With no doors! 
Gumball: [With squeaky voice] Okay, bye!
[Gumball puts the phone back, and now has a triangular shaped head due to getting crushed by the literal phone line. Darwin stares at the ceiling]
Gumball: What are you looking at?
Darwin: I dunno. What are you pointing at?
Gumball: Come on, [Takes Darwin's hand] let's just go together. [The two leave the house]
The Bus
[Scene then shows Gumball and Darwin, with Gumball's head back to normal, as they wait for the bus and get on. Darwin then speaks to the driver]
Darwin: Hello, two kids-price... [Deep voice] tickets please. [Covers his mouth]
[The bus driver is revealed to be a stout dwarf warrior]
Manly Warrior: You disgust me!
Gumball: Wait, what? [Deep voice] Why?
Manly Warrior: Where is your pride? Where is your beard? WHERE IS YOUR AXE?! [Draws out a large axe]
Gumball: [Deep voice] Wait, why are you driving with an axe?
Manly Warrior: Oh, I use it to push the pedals.
Darwin: [Deep voice] Sir, I think you're confused. We're not what you-
Manly Warrior: Your manly warrior voices gave you away! Our people built wonders in the mines of Ezrendel and here you are, pretending to be children to scrounge a bus fare! Shame on you!
Gumball: [Deep voice] Dude, we're not cheating anyone. We're kids.
Manly Warrior: I should report you to the Council of Elders!
Gnome 1: You don't need a discount! Your mountains are full of gold and mithril.
Gnome 2: How can someone be so little and yet so evil?
[Gnomes throw food and rubbish at Gumball and Darwin while they step off the bus; bus Driver throws his axe at them]
Gumball: Do you feel like walking? I feel like walking.
[Gumball and Darwin walk as scene transitions]
Sidewalk
Gumball: See? It wasn't that far.
[Camera zooms out to show that Gumball and Darwin's legs have been burnt off by walking]
Darwin: [Gasps] Look. [Darwin points to a sign on a window]
Gumball: Oh, wow. "Buy one, get one free on two-sided tape." That's like four-sided tape.
Darwin: No, [Grows legs back, points to higher sign] look! Half price on double chip cookies! That's like quadruple chocolate!
[Darwin runs off]
Gumball: [Attempting to catch up with Darwin] Hey, wait!
Store
Darwin: Hmm, where are the cookies? [To Larry] HEY!
Larry: [Surprised] Ohh! [Annoyed] "Hey" yourself, young man. I know I'm just a clerk here, but that is not a way to speak to people.
Darwin: [Loud] OH! SORRY! [Darwin covers his mouth]
Larry: Oh, I see. Now I'm getting attitude. You know there's a policy here for disrespectful customers.
Darwin: It's not... [Loud] MY fault.
Larry: Oh-ho-ho. So now it's my fault.
Darwin: Dude, [Loud] CHILL OUT! [Darwin covers his mouth]
Larry: You refrigerate yourself, mister. All right, that's it. [On radio] Security, we've got a code orange at aisle thirteen.
Darwin: No, please, it's not my fault.
[Gumball approaches]
Gumball: Dude, what's going on?
Darwin: I can't control the [Loud] VOLUME OF MY VOICE! [Crying] And now Larry's angry at me.
Gumball: Ah, don't worry. I'll take care of this.
[Security guard approaches]
Guard: Sir, I'm gonna need you to calm down.
Gumball: [Loud] WE ARE CALM!
[Gumball covers his mouth]
Guard: Don't force me to use force! You need to take it down a notch!
Gumball: [Loud] I CAN'T!
Guard: Fine! Then you asked for this! [Pulls out baton, which goes limp] Actually, I'm not allowed to do anything but ask you to leave the premises peacefully.
Car Park
[Gumball kicks debris until he gets sprayed by a soda can. Darwin drops to his knees, crying]
Gumball: Maybe I'll just call Dad for a ride home.
[Gumball runs off and comes back onto the scene]
Darwin: So?
Gumball: He didn't understand a word I said and told me he doesn't speak fax machine. [Gumball punches his larynx] Aw, stupid voice! [High-pitched voice] What [Robotic voice] is [Falsetto voice] wrong [Low voice] with [No voice] you!? [No voice, subtitled] Well, that didn't work.
[Patrick approaches in his car, with Penny in the backseat]
Penny: Gumball, where have you been? Why didn't you call me?
Gumball: [No voice, not subtitled] Penny, it's my voice. It's broke.
[Penny's window rolls up]
Patrick: Watterson, are you giving my daughter some kind of weird silent treatment? [Scary voice] Because if you are, I have a very specific set of skills. Skills I've a-
[Gumball sighs, opens the door, rolls the windows up and closes the door]
Gumball: [No voice, subtitled] I think we need a doctor.
Darwin: What? Oh, hold up.
[Darwin punches himself]
Darwin: [No voice, subtitled] I think we need a doctor.
Gumball: [No voice, subtitled] That's what I said!
The Doctor
Gumball: And sometimes it's perfectly fine. But the next thing you know, it's [Voice squeaks] all over the place.
[Doctor chuckles]
Darwin: [Distorted] Are you making fun of us because our voices are broke?
[Doctor continues to chuckle and a tear rolls down from his eye]
Doctor: Your voices are not broken, they're breaking. It means you're growing up.
[Gumball and Darwin sigh]
Doctor: Did you really think you would stay kids forever?
Darwin: [Deep voice] Yeah, kinda.
[Doctor chuckles again]
Gumball: [Deep voice] Isn't there something you can do?
Doctor: Hmm, no. Only a small percentage of the world doesn't age - mostly people on TV.
[Gumball and Darwin sigh sadly]
Doctor: Oh come on. Growing up isn't that bad. Soon you'll be strong and handsome, like your dad.
[Gumball and Darwin look at each other, their faces change to resemble Richard's and they gasp like him]
"Make the Most of It!"
Darwin: Come on. What's the best thing to do when you know your childhood days are numbered?
Gumball: Lie down on the ground and go like this?
[Gumball sits and starts to weep]
Darwin: No, dude. [Pets Gumball, then slaps him] You make the most of it.
Gumball and Darwin: [Singing] We enjoy it while we can. We enjoy it while we're kids. We enjoy it while there's still time to make the most of it.
Gumball: We go around the block and we loiter by the-
Gumball and Darwin: Mall.
Gumball: The people think we're thugs, so they give the cops a call.
Larry: [Spoken] Police?
Gumball: But we get away with it 'cuz it's a-
Gumball and Darwin: Public space.
Gumball: Turns out we weren't loitering-
Gumball and Darwin: Just standing in one place.
Gumball: I don't wear a suit or a-
Gumball and Darwin: Stupid tie!
Gumball: I dress with my eyes closed and-
Gumball and Darwin: I still look fly!
Louie: [Spoken] It looks like you got a leg transplant from a wiener dog.
Gumball: [Spoken] Oh, yeah, well you, uh... [Groans] And when I don't have a comeback I can always cry.
Gumball and Darwin: We enjoy it while we can. We enjoy it while we're kids. We enjoy it while there's still time to make the most of it.
Gumball: I'm allowed to eat candy, it's okay to be chubby. It's called baby fat, that's how my momma likes me. And I don't need to worry about the calories I ate 'cuz I'm just a kid with a crazy metabolic rate. [Turns skinny; spoken] Too far.
Darwin: Don't you ever worry about the cavities in your teeth?
Gumball: Who cares if these fall out? I've got new ones underneath!
Darwin: I'm getting tonnes of loot, 'cuz I look so cute. Where are these presents from? It just doesn't compute.
Gumball: We don't have to worry about makin' ends meet. We just throw things in the buggy-
Gumball and Darwin: That we like to eat.
Gumball:  'Cuz when you're still a kid, everything is magic. You don't know it yet-
Gumball and Darwin: Life can get pretty tragic. We enjoy it while we can. We enjoy it while we're kids. We enjoy it while there's still time to make the most of it.
Gumball: We don't have to worry, 'cuz we don't have-
Gumball and Darwin: Jobs.
Gumball: We can sit around all day and hang out-
Gumball and Darwin: Just like slobs. We don't freak out about resumes or skills. 'Cuz we don't have either, we got no bills. We got all the time that we wanna kill.
Newspaper Employee: [Spoken] What time is it?
Gumball and Darwin: It's time to chill!
Hank: [Spoken] What do you think you're doing?
Gumball: [Spoken] Just enjoying not having a job.
Hank: [Spoken] Well, you can't stay here!
Gumball: [Spoken] Why? Because the sight of our freedom hurts your adult feelings?
Hank: [Spoken] No, kid! You're gonna have to move, because-
[A truck horn blares; they get covered in rubble]
Gumball: When you're still a kid, being sick is cool. Mom gives you hugs, and you don't have to go to school. [Nicole kisses Gumball on the cheek] Stay at home, watch TV, all day slackin' off. If someone checks on you, just give 'em a little cough.
Richard: [Spoken] Are you alright?
[Gumball coughs]
Richard: [Spoken] Aww!
[Richard hugs Gumball, as he gives a demonic glare at the viewer]
Gumball: It's not my fault if I behave like a dummy. I do a lot of stupid things 'cuz I find it funny.
Gumball and Darwin: We don't need an excuse, 'cuz we got imagination. We're using it right now to escape the situation. Because when you're a kid, you dream of many things. Like being a Ninja Dentist, or a Wizard Cop with wings. We could fight a shark-bear-gator with a sword made of swords! Be the best at everything and win awesomeness awards. See an underwater castle and a seahorse made of crystal. Saving mermaids from sharkpeople using golden laser pistols. Plunder the universe in our pirate spaceship. Go back in time to teach cavemen how to kick-flip. Don't need to worry about our future plans or college. Super powers, robot arms, that's a substitute for knowledge.
Gumball: It's okay for me to dream that I'm a cowboy from the west!
Darwin: And for me to keep hopin' that there's still a chance to grow a [Deep voice]'[Deep voice]​​​ chest!
Gumball and Darwin: We enjoy it while we [Deep voice]'[Deep voice]​ can! We enjoy it while we're [Deep voice]'[Deep voice]​ kids! We enjoy it while there's [Deep voice]'[Deep voice]​ still time to make the most of [Deep voice]'[Deep voice]​​ it!
Gumball: [Clearing his throat] Come on, let's try it again.
Gumball and Darwin: [Deep voice] We enjoy it while we can. We enjoy it while we're kids. [Cuts to Billy and Felicity watching Gumball and Darwin] We enjoy it while there's still time to make the most of it!
Billy: Mother, what are those two short men doing?
Felicity: I believe they're pretending to still be young and cool, dear.
[Gumball and Darwin are upset by the reaction of the two]
A New Start
[Gumball is kicking trash until he kicks a ball that bounces back and hits his face; he cries]
Darwin: [In a deep voice] It's over, dude. If my voice went any lower, it would be on the ground! We're not kids anymore!
Gumball: [Deep voice; singing] Maybe it's for the better, no one wants to stay a child forever.
Darwin: [Deep voice; singing] Remember the wonderful times we've had, those happy thoughts now make me sad.
Gumball and Darwin: [Deep voice] They say it's not bad, it's just a new start. So why do I have this pain in my heart? Our childhood memories are getting hazy. But soon, we can drive, go to college, and we both go crazy!
[Gumball and Darwin's voices get squeaky]
Kids Again
[Gumball and Darwin are surprised by their voices and cover their mouths]
Gumball: [In new voice] What was that? [Gasps] Dude, what's goin' on? I sound even younger than before.
Darwin: [In new voice] That's it! That means we're in the one percent of people who never grow old.
Gumball and Darwin: Yay!
Gumball: We'll be kids forever!
Darwin: We got what we wanted!
Gumball: We're stuck in these bodies for the rest of our lives!
[Gumball and Darwin laugh happily but then the happiness fades]
Gumball and Darwin: [Weakly] Yay...
