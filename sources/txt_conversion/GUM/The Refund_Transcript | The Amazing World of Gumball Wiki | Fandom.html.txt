Put the Game On!
[The Wattersons' house, Gumball and Darwin are holding a game cartridge]
Gumball: [Staring at cartridge] Look, Darwin. We waited more than seven months for this.
Darwin: I know! We waited so long, I had time to grow hair.
Gumball: Huh?
[Darwin shows his leg, which is covered in thick hair]
Gumball: Whoa. May I touch it?
Darwin: You may.
Gumball: [Strokes Darwin's leg] Nice.
Darwin: Thanks. [Shouts at Gumball in excitement] Come on! Put the game on!
Gumball: [Opens the disc tray] Come on, come on. [Gasps] Oh, there you are. [Attempts to insert the cartridge in the disc tray, but it obviously does not fit] There's something wrong with it!
Darwin: [Shouting] Try the other way around! [Shakes flippers]
[Gumball tries again, to no avail]
Darwin: [Shouting] Come on! Can't you see I'm practically flipping my flippers?
Gumball: What is that supposed to mean?
Darwin: [Anxiously flapping his flippers] IT MEANS PUT THE GAME ON!
Gumball: I can't! It's not working!
[Darwin stops flipping his flippers]
Gumball: [Looks at the game cartridge] I think we got stiffed.
At Ripley 2000
Larry: I'm sorry, kids, but it's store policy. I can't give you a refund.
Gumball: What? You have to! We asked you a ton of questions before we bought it, remember?
[Flashback: Gumball and Darwin are asking Larry]
Gumball: What's bigger—a lion or a tiger?
Larry: A tiger.
Gumball: Why is the sky blue?
Larry: Diffraction of light through nitrogen.
Darwin: Can anything escape from a black hole?
Larry: Not unless it's a superheated quasar.
Gumball: What is 2,352 times 1,035?
Larry: 2,434,320.
Gumball: If you know all this stuff, how come you're a store clerk?
Larry: Look, you want this game or not?
Gumball: [Pulls out the game] We'll take it.
[Back to present time]
Larry: Actually, you never asked me anything about the game.
Gumball: Oh. You're right. [He and Darwin look down] But whatever! You have to give us a refund! It's been less than twenty-four hours!
Larry: Look, guys, if it was up to me, I'd totally give you a refund, [Whispering] but the manager won't allow it. [The camera behind him rotates towards him, and he laughs nervously] I- I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. Thanks for shopping at Ripley 2000.
[Gumball and Darwin start to make their way out of the store]
Gumball: [Points at Larry dramatically] This is not the end of it, Larry Needlemeyer! Mark my words! We will get a refund!
[They angrily leave the store, then immediately come back inside in a happy mood]
Gumball: Hi, Larry. Can we have a refund, please?
Larry: [Annoyed] Get out of here!
[They stomp out of the store again]
Gumball: Ripley 2000. More like "Rip-off" 2000!
Darwin: [Off-screen] Why is it 2000, anyway? It's not like it's the future anymore.
Plan B
[The shop's phone rings]
Larry: [On the phone] Hi. Yes, Mr. Manager. Uh, no, sir, I certainly didn't give a refund to those kids. Yes, I brought your suit to the dry cleaners and walked your dogs. Actually, the big one bit me. Oh, yes, he can be playful. This is why I was seven minutes late. Oh, yes, Mr. Manager, sir, it was entirely my fault. It won't happen again, sir. Have a nice— [The phone cuts off and Larry sighs]
Gumball: [Off-screen] This is the police! You're surrounded! Put your hands where I can see them!
[Larry puts his hands up]
Gumball: [Off-screen] Now put your hands on the cash register and take out twenty dollars!
[Larry tries to grab the cash register]
Gumball: [Off-screen] Now come outside and swap it for this computer game!
Larry: [Notices Gumball's voice] Hey! What kind of police are you?
Gumball: [Off-screen] The... super-real police. The... refund department... of justice!
Larry: Nice try, kids.
Gumball: [Off-screen] Darn! [Throws megaphone]
Plan C
[Gumball and Darwin go into the store]
Larry: Oh, look, kids, I'm not gonna give you a refund.
Gumball: We're not here to ask for a refund. We just want you to look at my new, shiny watch. [He gets a pocket watch and swings it in front of Larry]
Larry: I, uh, it's kind of hard when you... swing... it... like... that. [Trailing off, hypnotized]
Darwin: Did it work? Is he hypnotized?
Gumball: Let's test it. Okay. You're the world's most amazing dancer.
[Larry performs a short ballet routine, and Gumball and Darwin laugh]
Gumball: Okay, now... now you're an ostrich.
Darwin: No, a gorilla!
Gumball: A gorilla ostrich!
[Larry acts like a gorilla and an ostrich, Gumball and Darwin laugh]
Darwin: Now you have roller skates on!
[Larry starts slipping on rollerskates, still acting as a gorilla and an ostrich]
Gumball: And your butt's on fire!
[Larry shouts like a monkey and slaps his own butt as if trying to put off a fire, Gumball and Darwin laugh even harder, and then Larry crashes into a table with a pile of radios on top]
Gumball: And now you're a store clerk giving us a refund?
Larry: [Monotone, still hypnotized] Sorry. It's against store policy.
Gumball: [Sighs, upset] Now your butt's on fire again.
Larry: [Screams in pain] Aaaaaaaaah!
Plan D
[Gumball and Darwin enter Ripley 2000 again, with confident, smug faces and a TV]
Larry: Oh, come on. I told you—no refund.
Gumball: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. We're not going to ask you for a refund. We just want two minutes of your time.
[Darwin turns on the TV, showing a video]
Gumball: Every year, hundreds of children buy faulty computer games and don't get refunds. [opens door of Anais' room] This is Jimmy. [Camera zooms into Anais; she throws her Daisy doll at the camera] Jimmy really needed a refund, but the store manager wouldn't give it to him.
Darwin: [As store manager] I don't care that you're sad, Jimmy. It's store policy!
Gumball: Jimmy's life is now very bad, [Shows a box] and he lives in a shoe box. [Opens box] What's that, Jimmy? Yes, yes, Jimmy. [Closes box] I know you're sad and lonely.
[Music starts playing]
Darwin: Refund the world. Refund it sooner.
Gumball: Uphold the rights that little Jimmy had as a consumer.
Darwin: Now he's living in a box.
Gumball: He's a victim of deceit.
Gumball and Darwin: And even though he still had the receipt.
[The song ends shortly, back to the store]
Larry: [his voice breaks] Poor Jimmy. I-I had no idea it was such a big problem. [Wiping a single tear with his finger] Is there anything I can do?
Gumball: Well, you could look into your heart and...
Gumball and Darwin: [With big shiny eyes] Give us a refund?
Larry: I'm sorry, but no.
Gumball: [Sighs] Well, you leave us no choice, Larry. I'm gonna slap myself and Darwin's gonna hold his breath until you do something! [Gumball slaps himself in the face and Darwin holds his breath] Aah! Aah! This is on you, Larry! [Feeling painful] Oh! You can just stop all this suffering with just one word! Aah! Oh!
Larry: Okay, okay! Please stop. Look, maybe I could— [The camera is looking at Larry and he is laughing worriedly, faking a smile] I'm sorry, but "no" means "no."
Gumball: [Sighs in anger]
At Home
[Gumball and Darwin come home, Richard is sitting on the sofa]
Richard: Hey, kids! What's up?
Gumball: We couldn't get a refund, and now we're really cheesed off.
Richard: Watch your language, young man! "Cheese" is not to be invoked in vain in this house! But if it's a refund you're after, you've came to the right place— person— man— rabbit.
Gumball: Really? Let's go there right now!
Richard: Wait. If you're going to do something, you got to do it right. Heh!
[Richard gets off the sofa, rips off his shirt, and puts on a black vest. He then draws a tattoo of a deadly unicorn with "Nicole" on it on his arm using a pen, and after he does that, he grows a pair of wild mutton chops sideburns]
Richard: Now how do I look?
Gumball: Actually, you look like your wedding picture.
Richard: Perfect. Now, hand me that game.
Back at Ripley 2000
[Richard stares at Larry]
Larry: What do you want from me, you nut burger?!
Richard: Oh, you know what we want.
Gumball: We want what's rightfully ours, and we brought our dad!
Richard: Exactly.
Larry: For the last time, I can't!
Richard: Uhp! I wish to speak to your manager.
Larry: But you don't realize—he's a vile, cruel beast! [Notices CCTV camera zooming into him] Uh, sorry. No refund.
Richard: Shhh. Tch, tch, tch. Okay. Here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna return this game and get a refund. Look. I'm putting the game on the counter.
Larry: B-But—
Richard: Easy. Easy, pal. Now, I'm opening the register.
Larry: No, no, no! Sir, sir, sir, I wouldn't do that if I were you!
Richard: Well, lucky for me, I'm not you. So now I'm going to take what you owe us. See my hand? Slowly, slowly.
Gumball: Wait. Isn't that, like, stealing?
Larry: But you don't understand! You can't take money out of the register! You can only put it in!
[Richard pulls a twenty dollar bill out of the register, the alarm starts to sound]
Larry: Nooooooo! We're doomed!
Richard: Aah! What's going on?!
Larry: He's coming! [Slides through the exit]
Richard: Who's coming?!
Larry: The manager! [Escapes before the shutter door shuts]
Richard: Aaaah! I'm putting it back! I'm putting it back! I'm putting it back! [Notices the manager approaching the door] Aaaaaah! [Wailing] Please! Don't hurt me! [Bangs on the main door] It's not even my fault! It's their fault!
Gumball: What?! When you said you'd get us a refund, we didn't expect you to steal from the register!
Richard: You know very well I can't be trusted!
[Close-up of the doorknob turning]
Richard: Aaaaah! [Whimpers]
[The door opens, revealing that the manager is tiny]
The Manager
[Richard walks to the manager, and laughs at him]
Richard: Look at you! I thought you were going to be some huge dude! [Continues laughing] The look on our faces! Whoa! I mean, where's the light in your office? It must be on the floor in the back of the room or something! [Continues laughing] Phew! So, can we have our refund now?
Manager: No refund!
Richard: Oh, come on. We've all had a laugh and a little fright, but I think it's time to just give us our money back, and we'll be on our way.
Manager: I've had it with you and your brats trying to mess with my money! You think you can steal from me and laugh in my face?
Richard: Oh, you're adorable! But, seriously, though, you don't want this to get physical. You're lucky I'm a pacifist.
[The manager angrily pounces onto Richard's arm and bites him]
Richard: Ow. Ow! [Attempts to shake him off] Get him off! Get him off! Get him off!
Gumball and Darwin: Go, Dad! Whoo-hoo!
[The manager crawls into Richard's vest]
Gumball and Darwin: Come on, Dad! You got him!
[The manager crawls down Richard's pants]
Richard: He's inside my pants! Aaaah!
Gumball: Get him out!
Darwin: Yeah, kick his butt, Dad!
Gumball: Come on, Dad! You can take him!
[The manager pulls on Richard's ears]
Gumball: Dad?
Richard: Get him off! Get him off! Aah! Ow!
Darwin: He's not winning, is he?
Gumball: No.
[The manager begins hitting Richard's head rapidly]
Richard: What's wrong with you? Ow! Ow! Doesn't really hurt that much. But ow!
[The manager repeatedly slaps Richard's face with his own hands]
Richard: Oh, no! My beautiful face! Gumball! Darwin! Do something!
Gumball: Eh, this is getting kind of embarrassing.
[Gumball and Darwin walk towards the door]
Richard: [While the manager continues to pull on his ears] No! Don't abandon me, please! Ow! [The manager begins to bounce on Richard's butt] Ow! Ow! [The manager bites Richard's neck] Aah! He's biting my neck with his little teeth, and it tickles! [Laughs and eventually sobs]
[Gumball and Darwin return]
Gumball: Stop right there, little man!
Darwin: Yeah! Leave Mr. Dad alone! Otherwise...
Manager: Otherwise what?
Gumball: Otherwise, we'll put the security video online. What do you think the internet will say when it sees you slapping your customers with your little hands?
Manager: That it's pretty funny?
Gumball: Yeah, it was pretty funny. But you'll probably get a modest fine and a couple of days of community service.
Manager: So?
Gumball: So the shop will be closed.
Manager: And?
Gumball: And you'll lose money.
Manager: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to get excited. Okay, look, I can't give you a refund. It's a matter of principle. But since I find you quite pathetic, I'll give you a 1% discount on this new games console. That way, you can play the game you've already got. What do you say?
Gumball: Hmm. 1%. So, $700. That's, like, $7 off!
Richard: Now, that's what I call a bargain!
Darwin: Can we have your credit card, Mr. Dad?
Richard: Totally.
Gumball, Darwin and Richard: Whoo-hoo!
Back at Home
Richard: Ugh! Can't believe I got beat up by a garden gnome.
Gumball: Oh, come on. It was pretty funny.
Darwin: Like when you were screaming, "no, no, my beautiful face!"
Gumball: [Laughing] And when he was pounding on you from above and it looked like a tennis ball bouncing on a melon.
[The three laugh]
Richard: And thanks to me, we did get a huge discount on the console.
Darwin: Come on! Put the game on!
Gumball: Yes!
[Gumball inserts the game cartridge into the slot, but it is then unexpectedly shredded to pieces]
Gumball: Dad, he sold us a shredder.
Richard: [Sighs]
[Richard spawns his mutton chops sideburns again]
