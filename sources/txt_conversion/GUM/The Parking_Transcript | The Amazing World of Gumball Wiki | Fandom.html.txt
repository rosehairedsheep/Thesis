Going to the Mall
[Episode starts with Richard getting into the car with the rest of the Wattersons. The Wattersons drive to the mall parking lot, and Nicole backs the car into a parking spot]
Richard: STOOOOOOOOOOP!
Nicole: What? What?
Richard: There's a space closer to the entrance. [Points to spot]
[Nicole sighs and moves the car to park there. Before she can park, another car takes the spot. Nicole groans and tries to go back to the previous space, but another car parks in it]
Nicole: Gosh darn it, it's going to take ages to find a spot now! [Richard begins to sob] Oh don't worry honey, these things happen...
Richard: I know. I'm crying because I'm gonna have to walk now!
Finding a Parking Space
Gumball: There! An old lady walking back to her car!
[The Wattersons quickly drive up behind Betty. She walks at a very slow pace, and the Wattersons' car moves behind her at an equally slow pace. The Wattersons begin falling asleep until Nicole's head hits the horn, waking them all up]
Anais: Okay, it's a good idea to follow someone, but we need to be more intelligent with our profiling. Take those three. [Points out Quattro, Hank, and Hot Dog Guy, all of whom are exiting the mall with shopping bags] Shopping bags tell us they're going back to their cars, which will leave us with the choice of three spaces. The question is: which one will leave the space first. Look at the pepperoni guy's bags. [Camera focuses on his bags, showing details of what is within them as Anais speaks] The contours suggest he's bought toys and juice boxes, so he's a happy family man. Right? Wrong. Look closely at his face. [Camera focuses on Quattro's mouth and eye] See his constrained smile? That's the face of a man who has been broken by too much shopping. [As Anais speaks, Quattro gets into his car] His wife has sent him to the car so she can continue in peace. Now he's having a nervous breakdown 'cause he's gonna wait there for hours. [Quattro begins slamming his fists on his car's dashboard] Now take guy number two. [Camera changes to Hank, zooms in to show his hand] Notice he doesn't have a wedding ring? He's on his own, he doesn't have to wait for anyone, he'll be out of here quickly. [View shifts to Hank's wrist] But, observe the tan mark on his wrist where his watch should be, was it stolen? Possibly, [View shifts to Hank's neck, focusing on his somewhat torn shirt collar] but judging from the rest of his clothes, the watch wouldn't be worth stealing, more likely he just lost it or forgot to put it on this morning. Either way this means he's sloppy, inattentive, forgetful-
Gumball: Okay, what's your point?
Anais: He can't remember where he parked. [Hank is then shown confusedly looking around the parking lot] This leaves us with our third subject. Who... left while I was busy showing off and gave some other guy time to take his space... [While Anais says this, Banana Bob is seen taking the empty space. Anais sighs]
Gumball: Don't worry, it was pretty impressive, and it gave time for the old lady to reach her car!
[The Wattersons all gasp and drive up quickly behind Betty again. She slowly reaches for a car as the Wattersons get increasingly excited. However, Betty just rests for a moment against the car, and continues slowly walking. The Wattersons all growl in anger]
Gumball: Okay, okay, I got an idea. People make assumptions based on how you behave, right? So if you act like a rich person, they think you are a rich person.
Richard: How's that gonna help?
Gumball: Just give me your tie. [Gumball, now wearing a suit and tie, approaches Milk Guy, and speaks in a fancy voice] Son, park her up, will you? And be careful with the paint job, it costs more than you make in a year. [Throws the keys at Milk Guy, which end up stabbing him. Gumball stutters for a few seconds] Let me fix that. [Pulls the keys out of Milk Guy. Milk begins pouring out of the hole left by the keys, causing Milk Guy to start losing consciousness. Gumball pulls a dollar out of his pocket and sticks it into the hole in Milk Guy] There you go. [Whistles and runs away]
Faking and Fake-Outs
[Scene changes to the parking garage, where the Wattersons continue looking for parking spaces, with no success]
Richard: Oh, every space is taken. [Spray-Paint Bottle walks out of an exit as the Wattersons drive by. Richard stares at him, and then gets an idea] Honey, stop! [Nicole suddenly stops the car] Wait here a second.
[Richard gets out of the car. The sound of spray paint can be heard in the background]
Gumball: Can't we just go into the mall with Dad, and then you can find a space on your own?
Nicole: No, we're a family which means we do our suffering together. [The kids frown] Come on, guys, it's still a fun family day out. Let's turn those frowns upside down. [They move their faces upside down, but their eyebrows look like they're still frowning] Good enough.
Richard: Abraca-tada!
[Richard is revealed to have used Spray-Paint Bottle to spray-paint a fake parking spot for the Wattersons. Several citizens behind them start honking angrily. Milk Guy then runs into frame]
Milk Guy: Hey, you're not allowed to do that!
Richard: Ah! It wasn't me!
Spray-Paint Bottle: Yeah, it was.
[Richard becomes scared and runs away, spraying Spray-Paint Bottle the entire time. As Milk Guy corners Richard against a wall, Richard drops Spray-Paint Bottle in fear, causing him to bounce off the ground and fall out of the parking garage]
Milk Guy: Oh, my gosh, are you okay?
Spray-Paint Bottle: What do you think?
[The rest of the cars start driving where Richard spray painted, causing them to crash through the bricks and drive off the edge parking lot building. As the cars pile up on the ground below, Milk Guy growls at Richard. Richard chuckles nervously and runs off as more cars continue to pile up.]
[The Wattersons continue to drive through the parking garage. They suddenly see a large quantity of parking spaces, and stop driving to stare at them]
Gumball: [Whispering] It's a parking paradise.
Anais: It's a vehicular Valhalla.
Darwin: It's a short stay Shangri-La.
Richard: No, it's not, it's a parking lot.
Nicole: Let's go!
[They drive forward, only to crash into something. They then see the parking spaces are actually just a large photo on a wall]
Gumball: [Reading off wall] More parking coming soon. [They all sigh and back up. Richard crashes into the wall again] Dad!
Richard: Sorry, I needed to see if it opened yet. [Reverses the car again, then continues speaking off-screen] Ah, massive sandwich! [Crashes into another wall off-screen] Darn you, giant pictures of things I want!
Songs and Games
[As more cars pile up on the ground, the Wattersons continue looking for a parking space. Richard and the kids sing while Nicole drives. As they continue to sing, Nicole becomes more and more exasperated]
Richard, Darwin, Anais, & Gumball: [Singing] Ninety-nine bottles of age-appropriate beverage on the wall, ninety-nine bottles of age-appropriate beverage on the wall, take one down, pass it around, ninety-eight bottles of age-appropriate beverage bottles on the wall... Fifty-two bottles of age-appropriate beverage on the wall, fifty-two bottles of age-appropriate beverage on the wall... One bottle of age-appropriate beverage on the wall, one bottle of age-appropriate beverage on the wall, nanananananananana...
[Richard and the kids stay silent for a few seconds, until Richard signals for them to start over again]
Richard, Darwin, Anais, & Gumball: [Singing] Ninety-nine bottles of age-appropriate-
[Nicole suddenly brings the car to a sharp halt. She begins growling in anger before stopping]
Nicole: Why don't we play a game?
Richard: Good idea! I spy with my little eye something beginning with S.
Gumball: Is it the... suffocating feeling that we're never gonna leave this car?
Richard: Nope.
Anais: Is it the slow onset of insanity?
Richard: No.
Darwin: Is it super shiny sparkling sunflowers?
Richard: No, give up? It was... space.
Nicole: What? Where?
Richard: [Points to space] It was there. [Harold then pulls into the spot] But, it's gone now.
Nicole: What is wrong with you?! Why didn't you just tell us straight away?! [Sees Richard about to cry again] No no no no no no, wait! [Tosses a cookie into Richard's mouth. Richard points to his mouth to ask for another cookie. Nicole complies, and Richard feels better]
Vandalism
[More cars are seen piling up as the Wattersons return to the ground-level parking lot, continuing to look for a parking space]
Gumball: There!
[Gumball points to an empty parking space. Marvin then pulls up. He notices the Wattersons and stares them down. The Wattersons stare back at him. Marvin and Richard both rev their cars, until Richard finally shifts the Wattersons' car into drive, with Marvin shortly doing the same. They both race for the spot until the Wattersons' car begins slowing down. Richard notices the fuel gauge is on "empty"]
Richard: No! We're out of gas!
[Marvin continues racing for the space as the Wattersons start pushing their car]
Nicole: Keep pushing!
Anais: Wait, if you're there, then who's...
[The Wattersons stop pushing their car, causing it to veer out of control and crash into a van as Marvin pulls into the space]
Nicole: He took it. He knew we were going for it. And he [Deep, demonic voice] TOOK IT!
[Nicole angrily walks over to Marvin's car, pulls some lipstick out of her purse, and uses it to scribble on Marvin's car]
Darwin: Mrs. Mom?
Nicole: Yes, sweetheart?
[Darwin points to the handicap sign]
Darwin: [Whispering] That's really bad.
Nicole: Oh, what? You thought I was defacing this poor person's car? What kind of a mother would do that? I was.. [Stammers] I was making a decorative piece of art, showing my... love for diversity because everyone is different and uh- [Draws people holding hands on earth, on the car] Look! See?
Darwin: No, I meant: look. [Points to Marvin, still in his car, staring at Nicole in shock]
Nicole: [Laughs] I see, well, in that case: run!
[The Wattersons all run away]
The Last Straw
[The Wattersons are seen behind Betty once again, all screaming at her while Nicole continually blares the car horn]
Gumball: Wait! Why are we screaming at this poor old lady? It's mean and it's totally unconstructive. Let's just find out where her car is, have it towed, and take her space.
[Richard, Nicole, and Anais all speak at once in agreement]
Darwin: Or we could just give her a lift back to her car.
[Gumball, Anais, Nicole, and Richard all sigh and mumble. They then drive up alongside Betty]
Darwin: Could we be of assistance and help you to your vehicle?
[Betty is then shown in the back seat of the Wattersons' car squishing Gumball, Darwin, and Anais]
Gumball: So, what does your car look like?
Betty​​​​​: It's made of metal.
Gumball: [Laughs] Right, I thought it would be. Okay, what else?
Betty​​​​​: It has a steering wheel.
Gumball: [Laughs] Okay...
Betty​​​​​: It's quite loud.
Gumball: Good, good, that's useful. Could you be more precise?
Betty​​​​​: It smells like damp laundry and despair.
Gumball: Confusing...
Betty​​​​​: Oh, it's got a lady on the side selling shampoo and it's usually parked right there. [Points to the bus stop]
Anais: [Face palms] It's the bus, isn't it?
Betty​​​​​​​​​​​​: Sure is! And I've suckered you into giving me a lift! [Laughs and boards the bus. She then holds her hand in an "L" shape, puts it up to her forehead, and mouths "losers" as the bus pulls away]
Nicole: Alright, enough with the parking lot, let's just find a space. Any space.
[Nicole swerves the car around, knocking over the bus stop sign in the process, and quickly drives away, causing Principal Brown to crash into some parked cars]
Achieving Total Parking
[The Wattersons first park in an alleyway. A garbage truck then grabs their car, dumping the family out the car's rear door. The family then pulls into a car wash, where Nicole and Richard a swung around by the mechanisms as soon as they exit the car. They then park on an airplane runway, but scream and jump back into their car as an airplane taxis in for landing, blowing their car away in the process. The Wattersons next park at the container port, only for their car to be picked up by a crane and dragged above the crusher. They all scream in horror, but the crane holding their car stops, as another crane drops an empty car into the crusher]
Gumball, Darwin, Anais, Nicole, and Richard: Ah, come on!
[The Wattersons back into an elevator, but Richard and Nicole cannot open their doors to get out of the car. They all sigh as the elevator door closes. The Wattersons' car is then seen in a parking space, only for the scenery to be revealed as nothing more than a scale diorama by Goblin]
Goblin: And when finished there'll be more than...
[Goblin then notices the Wattersons parked on a window cleaning platform. He, Dolphin Man, and Butterknife angrily stare as the Wattersons are lowered down. At the hospital, the Old Doctor prepares to deliver a baby, but angrily glares underneath the sheet. He then carries the Wattersons' car outside and throws them away. At the movie theater, the Wattersons are seen parked between rows of seats, much to the audience's annoyance. Larry points a flashlight at them, and they drive away. On the screen, a woman opens a door and screams, only for the Wattersons to be behind the door. The people in the audience groan, and the Wattersons drive off-screen. They then crash through the theater wall]
Richard: Wait, wait, wait! [Nicole stops the car. Richard sadly looks at her. Nicole sighs and reverses into the theater] Hot and buttered, please! [An employee hands Richard a bucket of popcorn, and the family sets off again]
[As they continue searching for somewhere to park, they notice Karen driving away, leaving an open spot]
Gumball, Darwin, Anais, and Richard: Yay!
Gumball: Oh, no, look! [Points to a car creeping out from some bushes. Another car then peers out from behind a tree, while another rises up from a pond]
Nicole: Not this time!
[Nicole sets the car in drive and charges for the space. As she does, the other cars jump onto the road behind her. Nicole rams into the cars beside her, causing them to spin out of control. The car behind her then races alongside her. Nicole speeds up even more]
Gumball: Mom, slow down, you're gonna miss the spot!
Nicole: Hold onto your hats! [All grab a hat and hold on to it]
[Nicole rams the car next to her out of the way. The kids all scream as their car suddenly flips over multiple times and flies into the air, all of which is shown in slow motion. The Wattersons then land in the empty spot as the car behind them drives past]
Gumball: My friends, we have achieved total parking.
[Nicole puts the car in park, and the Wattersons all get out. They begin cheering and celebrating]
Gumball, Darwin, Anais, Nicole, and Richard: In your face, we got our space! In your face, we got our space!
[As they celebrate, the camera pans back to reveal that they have parked in front of their own house]
Gumball: Good job, everybody- [Stops as they all realize they are in front of their house again]
Gumball, Darwin, Anais, Nicole, and Richard: Oh.
