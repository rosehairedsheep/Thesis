The Sale
[The episode starts with Gumball and Darwin falling through the house floor. Then it cuts to a shot of them in reality; they are imagining that they are falling]
Anais: Come on, guys. Mr. Robinson selling his house is not the end of the world.
Nicole: Maybe we'll get some pleasant neighbors this time.
[Still imagining they are falling through a hole, Gumball and Darwin notice what Nicole said and fly up to the top of the hole. In reality, they suddenly get up and make angry faces, intimidating her]
Darwin: [Demonic voice] TAKE THAT BACK!
Gumball: [Same demonic voice as Darwin's] NO NEIGHBOR COULD EVER REPLACE THE MIRACLE THAT IS GAYLORD ROBINSON! TAKE IT BACK!
Nicole: Okay, okay, okay! I take it back.
Darwin: DO IT PROPERLY! TAKE YOUR WORDS BACK!
Nicole: Kcab ti ekat I. yako, yako, yako!
Gumball: [Normal voice] Thank you.
[Gumball and Darwin faint and imagine they are falling through a hole again]
Anais: But hold on. If you've only just found out he's leaving, how'd you make that shrine so quickly?
[Cut to a shot of the shrine]
Gumball: That? Oh, we've had that forever. Now if you'll excuse us, we have some mourning to do.
[Gumball rips his shirt off and starts mourning, with Darwin joining him silently]
Gumball: WHYYYYY?! WE HAD SO MUCH MORE TO GIVE! [Starts slapping himself in the head; Darwin does this as well] AUGH, TAKE ME INSTEAD!!!
[Darwin is still slapping his head]
Gumball: What's that about?
[Darwin speaks in sign language with realistic orange arms; a caption on the screen says "I've taken a vow not to speak"]
Gumball: Ooooooh, now I understand... That I definitely don't speak sign language.
Darwin: [Sighs] I've taken a vow of silence.
Gumball: Well, you just broke it! You dishonored Mr. Robinson's memory!
[The two keep on mourning]
Gumball and Darwin: I'M SORRY!!! I'M SORRY!!!
Nicole: You guys realize he's still alive?
Gumball: You're right. He is still alive. In here. [Points to his heart]
Nicole: [Drags the boys outside] No, he's here.
[Points to Mr. Robinson's house. Mr. Robinson is on a ladder, hammering a nail on the house, pants low enough to show his rear end]
Nicole: Mooning us.
Gumball: [He and Darwin gasp] We're wasting time! We should be up there, creating precious moments with him!
Making Precious Memories
[Cut to a shot of Mr. Robinson from a window in the house. He is climbing down the ladder]
Gaylord: I must be getting old. This is much harder than it used to be.
[Cut to a shot of the outside of the house, where it turns out Gumball and Darwin are hugging him from his back]
Gaylord: [Notices Gumball and Darwin] What the- [Falls down the ladder] What are you doing?
Gumball: Making memories.
Darwin: We're never gonna see you again! We've gotta make every moment count!
Gaylord: Ugh... I don't have time for this.
Gumball: Why?
Gaylord: Because I need to make the house perfect before the buyers see it. And also because I hate you! No, uh, "hate" isn't quite the right word, it's more like "despise". No, no, maybe "abhor". Yeah. I abhor you! No, you know what? I was right the first time. I hate you! You're the main reason I'm moving!
Gumball: [Caresses Mr. Robinson] I understand. You're pushing us away so you don't have to confront the pain of leaving.
Gaylord: [Squishes Gumball's face by pushing it in an attempt to push him away] No, I'm pushing you away because I like pushing you away!
Gumball: Let's remember the good times, and maybe make a few more.
[A montage plays of both Gumball and Darwin taking selfies in front of Mr. Robinson]
Gaylord: What are you doing? I didn't give you permission to take photographs!
[Gumball and Darwin fall]
Gumball: But we've got nothing to remember you by.
Darwin: Not even a lock of your hair.
Gaylord: I'm bald! I'm not gonna give you my eyebrow.
Gumball: How about we just take this thread?
Gaylord: What are you gonna do with it?
Gumball: We'll take it home, cook it and eat it so you'll be a part of us forever.
Gaylord: You'll go home?!
Gumball: Uh-huh!
Gaylord: Then it's all yours!
Gumball: Ah!
[Gumball pulls thread then Mr. Robinson's nose and face get's pulled with it]
Gaylord: Are you done here?
[Mr. Robinson's face comes back to normal]
Gaylord: Just go!
[Gumball and Darwin leave while carrying the thread like a king and singing with glory]
[Mr. Robinson's arm then falls off]
Gaylord: Oh, no! No no no no no!
[Mr. Robinson's body then falls apart]
[Gumball takes Mr. Robinson's eyebrow then Gumball and Darwin leave singing with glory]
Gaylord: Ugh.
A Misunderstandable Call
[The scene flashes to Mr. Robinson blowing the leaves away]
Gaylord: Perfect!
[Mr. Robinson's phone then rings and answers it]
Gaylord: Ah! You're on your way, heh! Great! Great! Great! Great! Hahah! Ahahah! Heh!
[Mr. Robinson notices Gumball & Darwin, and then throws his phone down]
Gaylord: Get out of here! I don't want you damaging anything!
Jeff: [On the phone] Damage?! There's damage in the house?!
Gaylord: No, no, no, no! There's no damage of any kind! Heheheh!
Gumball: So, we were wondering what to do when we miss each other. Shall we choose a star that we can all watch in the same time?
Gaylord: [Ignoring them] Sure! No problem!
[Gets off the phone]
Gaylord: Would you please stop asking me stupid questions, you little blood-sucker!?
Jeff: [On the phone] Who ya callin' a sucker?
Gaylord: WHAT?! Ohh no! I didn't call you a sucker! No, there's a small leech problem in the garden! Uh, nothin' to worry about!
[Mr. Robinson is still talking on the phone]
Darwin: How about we swap shirts, so we can always remember each others' smell.
[Darwin grabs Mr. Robinson's collar then smells it]
[Mr. Robinson then throws the phone down]
Gaylord: I don't want your rancid stink in my house!
[Jeff screams angrily on the phone]
Gaylord: Ohh no, no no! Not you! I do want your smell! Yeah, yeah!
[Mr. Robinson is still talking on the phone]
[Gumball then taps him]
Gumball: Mr. Robinson? Mr. Robinson? Hey, Mr. Robinson.
Gaylord: Yes we can!
[Gumball taps him again]
Gumball: Mr. Robinson?
Gaylord: We can have this conversation, yes! I'll see you as soon as you—
Gumball: Mr. Robinson?
[Mr. Robinson gets off the phone]
Gaylord: STOP YOUR YAPPING!
[Jeff hangs up]
Gaylord: No, no, no, no, no! AArggghhh.
Gumball: Mr. Robinson?
Gaylord: Whaaat?
Gumball: Do you want your goodbye present now?
Gaylord: Does your present involve you leaving?
Gumball: Kinda, I guess.
[Gumball and Darwin then leave running. Mr. Robinson then sighs in relief]
"Never Gonna Let You Go"
[Gumball and Darwin return dancing with long, white cloths]
Gaylord: What is this?!
[Gumball sings]
Gumball: The song's our parting gift to you!
Darwin: Like we've seen people in movies do!
Gumball: They're not great movies, sure, that's true! But we'll see this through!
Darwin: I guess it's time for you to leave
Gumball & Darwin: But there's one thing you need to know! We'll never really let you go!
[Mr. Robinson then puts his hand on his face in nuisance]
Gumball: When you wake!
Darwin: And when you sleep!
Gumball and Darwin: Near or far, you must believe! We'll never really let you go-ohh! Hoahhh!
Gumball: Mountains high and rivers deep!
Darwin: We'll be there, we're yours to keep!
Gumball: We're yours to keep!
Darwin: We're never gonna let you to go...
Gumball: We won't forget, your smile or smell!
Gumball: We know them both, you know full well!
[Gumball & Darwin are still singing]
[Mr. Robinson notices the Bensons' car, then he blows Gumball & Darwin away with his leaf-blower]
Gaylord: Glad you can make it! Let me show you around!
A Sign From Above
[The scene flashes to Gumball & Darwin going back to the shrine]
Gumball: This is really happening, dude! They're here, ready to sign the papers. Then we're gonna lose Mr. Robinson forever!!
Darwin: Oh, Mr. Robinson! If you can hear this, give us a sign! Tell us how we can make you stay!
[Light shines on Mr. Robinson's face on the painting]
[Gumball makes an impression of Mr. Robinson]
Gumball: Sabotage the sale! Sabotage the sale!! Sabotage the sale!!!
[Darwin realizes it's Gumball]
Darwin: Dude, you could've just told me!
Gumball: Okay, sabotage the sale.
Darwin: Oh! Good idea!
[Both leave running]
Sabotaging the Sale
Gaylord: [In a posh voice] Now that you have seen the grounds would you be so kind to follow me into the main house? [Bows down] I have no idea why I'm bowing like this or speaking like this but, er, please just ignore me... [Chuckles] Ah, I'll put some coffee on, you take your time.
Gumball: [Talking in evil voice] There's evil in that house...
[Closeup on Gumball's scarred face in which one eye is blinded]
Gumball: [Still talking in evil voice] I said there's evil in that house...
[Gumball snorts and spits out, only the spit sticks to his tongue and tries numerous times to get it off. Eventually, he sucks it back in]
Gumball: This is as far as I'm willing to take you, you're on your own now...
Susan: You didn't take us anywhere.
Gumball: You're on your own now!
Jeff: You didn't- OK, thank you.
Gumball: You're on your own!
[A van passes by and Gumball dissapears, but it's then revealed that Gumball just hid behind a trashcan. The Bensons turn around and move into the house]
[The scene cuts to Susan going up the stairway into a dark hallway. Susan is about to turn the light on]
Susan: [Looks at the other section and sees a strange figure (Darwin)] [Gasps]
[Susan turns the light on, the figure then disappears. She repeats this a couple of times until she heads forward, scared. The figure (Darwin) quickly follows her. Susan is scared, and then looks behind and gasps to see nobody there behind her. Susan continues walking as she looks at her back and eventually turns her head around, running into Mr. Robinson]
Susan: [Screams, then stops]
Gaylord: Would you like to check out the bathroom? [Opens the door]
[Darwin is seen in the bathroom, floating and colored in white, with big hair]
Susan: Maybe later...
[Mr. Robinson closes the door, Darwin then screams and gets knocked out of the window]
Gaylord: This is my wife Margaret, oh, don't worry, she doesn't come with the house. [Laughs nervously]
[Margaret groans]
Jeff: How safe is the neighborhood?
Gaylord: We never had any problems. I would say it's pretty s-
Darwin: [Dressed up as a police officer] Put your hands where I can see them. You're going down.
Gumball: [Dressed up as a criminal] Nah, dog. I'll be out in thirty days to continue my crime spree, starting right here.
Darwin: Not on my watch, now get down on the ground! [Throws Gumball on the ground] Sir, get up, sir. You have the right to remain silent, now watch your head [Takes Gumball to the car]. Hey, this is not your car. I'll charge you with grand theft auto.
Susan: Wow, I think the police is scarier than the criminals.
Gaylord: Let's take a look upstairs.
Darwin: [Off-screen] I am the law!
[Mr. Robinson closes the curtains]
[The scene cuts to Gumball and Darwin in their room, Both with a frown as Gumball tries to hide the bump from his face till he finally hides it]
Darwin: [Takes off his hat] Sorry, dude, but with the badge, the uniform and an unchecked sense of authority, I got a little carried away.
Gumball: That's not what I'm worried about, it's these buyers: they are not giving up. We need to get harder on them.
[Gumball hits his hand with a fist as the bump comes back]
[The Bensons open a window of the house]
[The sounds of a freeway are heard]
Susan: Is there a freeway nearby?
[Airplane lifting sounds are heard]
Jeff: And an airport?
[Animal sounds can be heard]
Susan: And a zoo?!
[It is revealed that Gumball and Darwin are using piano sounds to sound like there are noisy things nearby, Darwin then presses another key on the piano]
[Normal music plays]
Jeff: And what can only be a giant elevator?
[Darwin plays fart sounds on the piano]
Susan: [Scared] And vegetarians?!
Gumball and Darwin: Yes! [High Five]
[Susan looks out of the window]
Susan: Wow, our own gates to the Underworld. Didn't notice that when we came in.
[A car passes by, revealing the hole to be just a painting. Gumball and Darwin high-five each other]
[The scene changes to radioactive waste in the Robinsons' cupboard, Gumball and Darwin scaring them under the bed (both times with Gumball and Darwin high-fiving after the Bensons leave), the hobo in the bathtub growls at them, and flies onto their frontyard. The scene cuts to Richard sleeping on the couch]
Gumball: [Whispering] Now, to seal the deal. [Puts a wolf mask on Richard and gives him a shovel] DAD, QUICK, ANAIS IS TRAPPED IN THE SHED AND WE CAN'T FIND THE KEYS!
Richard: I'm coming, baby! I'm coming for you! [Makes a hole through the door with the shovel] DADDY'S COMING! [Continues to hit the shed's door with the shovel until it falls]
Jeff: Meh, I can live with that.
Gumball: Oh, what is wrong with these people!? I mean: who would wanna live in a place like this!?
Susan: So, what do you think?
Jeff: Well, their house is awful and the neighborhood is like a demilitarized zone, but their soil! That's the reason we should take it.
[The words "their soil" reverberate throughout Gumball's mind, corrupting into "there's oil"]
Gumball: [Gasps] There's oil under the garden!
Darwin: Mr. Robinson is sitting on a fortune and he doesn't even know.
Gumball: But those guys are not even vegetables! We gotta stop the sale!
Living Under a "Fortune"
Gaylord: So, what do you say?
Jeff: We'll take it.
[Hurriedly, Gumball runs and jumps in front of Mr. Robinson's sales contract, just as Jeff writes his signature]
Gumball: [In slow-motion] NOOOOOO!
[Jeff ends up signing on Gumball's sweater as he falls to the ground]
Gaylord: What - are - you - DOING?!
Gumball: Mr. Robinson, there's something you need to know. Mr. and Mrs... [Reads the signature on his sweater] Benson are not exactly what they seem and I'm here to unmask them. [Rips pieces of Jeff's face] Ok, so maybe they are vegetables, but they're here to take advantage of you.
Gaylord: What do you mean?
Gumball: They don't care about the house, they only care about what's underneath it. I let them tell you why.
Susan: Because we need good soil to plant our children?
Gumball: LIES! They only want what's under the soil: oil.
Susan: That makes no sense.
[Gumball runs up to Richard and takes his shovel]
Gumball: Or does it?
[Gumball pokes the shovel into the ground, revealing what appears to be oil]
Gaylord: Oil?! We're rich! No sale! Margaret, we're staying right here.
[Everyone but the Bensons starts cheering]
Susan: Oh, forget it.
[Jeff and Susan get in their car]
Jeff: Are you sure, Susan? We can always make higher offer. The soil was perfect.
Susan: No way, the neighbours are unbearable. Anyway, who'd want it? It's covered in raw sewage.
[The camera goes down and a pipe saying "Elmore City Sewage" is revealed]
