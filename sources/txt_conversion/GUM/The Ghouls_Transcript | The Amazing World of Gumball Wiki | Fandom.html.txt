Richard: And if you fill these up, start eating!
Darwin: And when we're offered raisins, we refuse them 'cause they're healthy.

[Billy rings the doorbell of the Wilsons' house. Jackie opens the door]

[Everyone laughs]
Carrie's House
Gumball: Hey, dude, we should go get Carrie! [Walks off-screen]
Darwin: [Follows him] Uh, she's not the Halloween type. She said she'd rather skip it.
Gumball: But, she's a ghost. That's like saying Mr. Small would miss out on a, psychic crystal convention—
Mister Small​​​​​​​: [Appears behind a tree] PSYCHIC CRYSTAL CONVENTION?! [Zooms to them] Where?!
Gumball: Uh...
Mister Small​​​​​​​: [Gumball makes a face] Yeah? [He makes another face] Yeah? [He makes another face] Yeah?! [He makes another face] Okay, so that's ten blocks down, third street on the right, thanks! [Runs off]
Darwin: Did you tell him all that with your mind?
Gumball: [Folds arms] No.
Darwin: Then what did you tell him?
Gumball: Yeah, it's not appropriate to say out loud. [Walks off]
[They are now at Carrie's house. Gumball is repeatedly knocking her door with the knocker]
Darwin: Uh, dude. [Gumball stops] When someone doesn't answer the door, it means they're either busy or not in.
Gumball: No, it means you didn't knock loud enough. [Proceeds to continue knocking]
[Carrie's head phases through the door]
Carrie: Go away! I'm in a middle of a—of a—dinner! [Her head phases back]
Gumball: You're a ghost, you don't eat.
Carrie: [Her head returns] Yeah, well then I'm—I'm busy! [Goes back]
Gumball: You're immortal. You've got all the time in the world.
Carrie: [Her head returns] Yeah, well, uh—I've got a doctor's appointment in the morning! [Leaves again]
Gumball: Uh, you've been dead for three hundred years, I'm not sure your health insurance will cover anything they find.
Carrie: [Phases fully out of the door] Look! I just don't want anything to do with Halloween, okay?
Gumball: [Laughs] What? B—but it's great! I mean, there's candy, and costumes—
Darwin: And candy—
Carrie: On my point exactly, Halloween is supposed to be for the ghosts and ghouls of Elmore. It's going to be scary, but it's not anymore.
Gumball: Well, sure it is!
Carrie: I don't mean how frightening your dental hygiene is after illegal amounts of candy.
Darwin: What do you mean— [Both his fake and real teeth fall off] Uh...
Gumball: Well, what do all the ghosts and ghouls do on Halloween?
Carrie: Well, they're still around trying to scare people, but it's way harder these days. Come, I'll show you.
[She starts to float away, but then sees them with eyes closed, knees bent and holding up their right hands]
Carrie: Wait, what are you doing?
Gumball: Aren't you going to take us by the hand and fly us to see the Halloweens that have been and the Halloweens that are yet to come?
Carrie: No, we're going across the street.
[Tobias and Banana Joe are seen receiving candy from Judith]
Tobias​​​​​​​ and Banana Joe: Thanks!
Carrie: And if you can't cross the road without holding someone's hand, then maybe you shouldn't be out this late.
Mr. Candy
[Tobias and Banana Joe walk away from the Fitzgerald's house]
Tobias​​​​​​​: Dude, you know how we can get more candy without trick or treating?
Banana Joe: We plant some, and harvest it next fall!
Tobias​​​​​​​: No, there's an urban legend that you can summon Mr. Candy. All you gotta do is say his name three times.
Banana Joe: Sweet! I'm in.
[They get ready to summon Mr. Candy.]
Tobias​​​​​​​ and Banana Joe: Candy, Candy, Candy!
[A flash of light and a loud thunder like sound is heard to their right. Mr. Candy is seen standing there with a pose surrounded by bees]
Mr. Candy: They will taste my sweet revenge! [Turns around] Huh?
Tobias​​​​​​​ and Banana Joe: [Hold up their baskets] Eh?
Mr. Candy: What?
Tobias​​​​​​​ and Banana Joe: We want candy!
Mr. Candy: Well I don't have any.
Tobias​​​​​​​: But you're supposed to bring us candy!
Mr. Candy: No, if you summon me, I'm supposed to exact a terrible revenge upon you for my unjust end! [Swings his hooked hand and lightning strikes]
Tobias​​​​​​​: And then give us candy?
Mr. Candy: No! And if you don't mind, I was in the middle of something! [With a swing of his hook, he materializes away]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ and Banana Joe: [Looks at each other] Candy, Candy, Candy!
Mr. Candy: [He appears with a flash with the same pose as before. He glares at them] What?!
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Yeah, do you know anyone who does give out candy?
Mr. Candy: No! [Materializes away again]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ and Banana Joe: Candy, Candy, Candy!
Mr. Candy: [Appears with a flash once more] Oh for—ugh... [Takes something small out of his coat with his hook] I got half a breath mint. Take that and leave me alone.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Sighs and they both walk away] You really don't live up to your name man.
Banana Joe: [Runs back, takes the breath mint and eats it] Hmm, fresh! [Walks off]
[Mr. Candy screams in frustration and materializes away once again. Gumball, Darwin and Carrie appear behind a nearby bush]
Gumball: He's kinda got a point. The name is quite misleading.
Darwin: Maybe he should call himself Mr. Angry Bee Head.
Carrie: Come on. Let me show you something else. [Holds them and they all teleport away. Gumball's wizard hat falls to the ground.]
Fingernails Ghoul
[A scared Hank is seen in a factory running. As he turns a corner, a figure in a hat advances forward, laughing evilly. Hank soon runs to a pair of iron doors. As the figure's extremely sharp nails scratch across a pipe creating sparks, Hank tries to open the iron doors, which are locked. The figure's shadow can be seen moving towards him as he raises one of his sharp finger-nailed hands and places it on Hank's right shoulder, laughing menacingly in a demonic voice]
Hank: [Gasps] I'm sorry, it won't happen again—huh? Who are you?
Figernails ghoul: Your worst nightmare! [Laughs menacingly, but then stops] Wait, you're not scared of me?
Hank: No, not really.
Fingernails ghoul: But... you were running away from me.
Hank: No, I was running because I was going to be l...ate.
[He looks down and sees himself wearing only underwear at his bottom half] Ugh, it's another work dream.
[George and Steve are then seen laughing at Hank while he covers himself. The fingernails ghoul sighs, then snaps his fingers, ending the dream]
Hank: [He wakes up, screaming and panicking, looking around the bed. Then he stops as he sees the fingernails ghoul sitting at the side of the bed, looking sad] So, uh, what are you doing here?
Fingernails ghoul: I'm here to haunt nightmares. What are you most scared of?
Hank: Well, I still got nineteen years to pay my mortgage, that's a little daunting.
Fingernails ghoul: [He sighs, gets up and walks to Hank's side. He then turns around and scissor snipping can be heard. Then he turns back around holding a piece of paper in a shape of a house suspended on a string and dangles it over Hank] Ooh, house repayments, foreclosure—Ugh, anything else scarier?
Hank: Well, I do worry that my talent won't live up to my expectations.
Fingernails ghoul: Oh come on, how am I supposed to show that? Whatever happened to bats and snakes? [Takes out a box and opens it] I got a live toad. [Looks inside] Oh. Air holes. I got a toad.
Hank: Hmm, nah. I'm good.
[The Fingernails Ghoul sighs and sits on the bed again]
Hank: Well, [Stretches and yawns] I'm quite tired and I've got work in the morning and—
Fingernails ghoul: Yeah yeah, I know, afraid you're gonna be late. [Short pause. He then starts crying and puts his hands to his face]
Hank: Uhh... [Takes a tissue and offers it to him] There, there, buddy.
[Gumball, Darwin and Carrie are seen watching outside the window]
Carrie: See? No one's scared anymore.
Gumball: I don't know, I think it'd be pretty scary if he blew his nose. [A scream can be heard inside Hank's house] Yep, there it is.
Darwin: But isn't it weird spying on people like this?
Leonard Daniels: [Off-screen] No.
[Leonard is then seen sitting on a nearby tree branch, using a pair of binoculars to see into the distance]
Leonard Daniels: It's only weird if you make it weird.
Gumball: See? There are some scary things on Halloween night.
Carrie: That's not what I meant.
[She flies to them both and they all teleport away again]
Walking Shadow, part 1
[Scene changes to Elmore Junior High. Rocky is then seen cleaning one of the hallways listening to music on his headphones. He looks up and sees a person completely made out of shadow advancing towards him from the far side of the hallway. He shrugs and continues to mop the floor. He then looks up again. The shadowy figure is getting closer]
Rocky: [Shrugs and begins to mop again] Hm.
[Before he starts again however, Rocky frowns and looks up once more. As the shadowy figure gets closer, he phases through a nearby roomba]
Rocky: Uh, oh, ah! Ahh! [Drops the mop and runs away screaming]
Hair Lady
[The scene changes to Leslie and Alan at the park, walking along a pathway. They stop as they spot a videotape on the ground]
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Hmm? [Picks it up and reads it] "If you play this it could be the last thing you ever play."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Gasps] That's terrible! Littering in our beautiful parks! The nerve of some people. What is it anyway?
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: No idea. It looks like someone tried to make a book out of plastic and ribbon.
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Maybe it's a yo-yo, from before they discovered gravity! Give it a go!
[Leslie pulls out the ribbon of the videotape and repeatedly moves his hand up and down, causing it to constantly hit the ground]
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: See?
[Suddenly, from a nearby well, a lady with extremely long hair that covers her face crawls out and rushes towards the two]
Hair lady: No. No. No, no, no, don't! You're ruining it! [Snatches it from Leslie] It's a cursed videotape! You watch it on a VHS player!
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: A what?
[Cut to the art room in Elmore Junior High. The hair lady puts the videotape into a VHS player with a television above it]
Hair lady: And that's how a VHS works. Of course, the problem with this cursed tape is, you know, people don't get the chance to rewind it.
[She presses a button on the VHS player and the tape starts rewinding. As the television is filled with static making a whirring noise, the three wait in silence. A long pause. Leslie and Alan look at each other then back to the screen. They continue to wait]
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Checks his watch] Yeah, anyway I got a life to live. Is there any way we can stream it?
Walking Shadow, part 2
[Scene changes to a Joyful Burger outside the Elmore Mall. Rocky is seen with a burger with the pickles removed. As he is about to eat it, he sees the shadowed person walking towards him from the mall entrance. Rocky watches in fear. As the shadow person keeps walking, a passing car phases through him. Rocky throws away his burger, screams and runs away, knocking down an oval person in the process]
Rocky: Ahh!
Ghostface
[The scene changes to Sarah's house as lightning strikes several times while it is raining. Sarah is seen in her bedroom writing on a book when a vibration can be heard. She takes her phone from under the table and answers it]
Ghostface: Do you want to watch a scary movie?
Sarah: W—what do you mean?
[The screen splits into two, revealing Ghostface speaking]
Ghostface: I said, do you want to watch a scary movie?
Sarah: No, I mean, what sort? Vampire, zombie, werewolf, zombie werewolf—
[For the rest of the conversation, Sarah leaves her house, enters another and locks all the windows and doors while talking on the phone]
Ghostface: Huh?
Sarah: —werewolf zombie, werewolf vampire—
Ghostface: Uh...
Sarah: —zombie werewolf vampire, haunted house, grind house—
Ghostface: Uh—wha—I—I—I—
Sarah: —esp horror, crime and giallo, Lovecraftian,—
Ghostface: Uh, I—I—I...
Sarah: —mummies and goblins, Cthulhu mythos—
Ghostface: I—I—I, I don't—You know what? I—
Sarah: —jiangshi fiction, mumble gore, or do you mean gothics!
Ghostface: [Facepalms] Ugh...
Sarah: —southern gothic, southern Ontario gothic, urban gothic, suburban gothic, tasmanian gothic—
Ghostface: [Hears someone at the door] Uh, you know what? Someone's at the door, I gotta go.
Sarah: No, there's not, I just locked all the doors and windows. You have to watch a scary movie with me now.
Ghostface: No—no—no, I don't. I can hang up! [Hangs up] Ha ha ha!
[Sarah appears creepily from the shadows behind Ghostface]
Sarah: You can't hide, 'cause the first place that I'd look would be in your basement...
Ghostface: What the?! You're here?!
Sarah: I thought you wanted to watch a scary movie... [Creepy face and voice] 'cause I really love scary movies.
Walking Shadow, part 3
[Cuts to Rocky running across a parking lot, looking back nervously. As he reaches the Elmore Gym, he looks back and sees the shadowy figure walking towards him. He then pulls out a key card and starts swiping the lock. After his second try, the door slides open and he rushes in. Inside, he pushes a treadmill across the room. When he sees the shadow figure walk closer to him, he braces himself. However, the figure walks onto the treadmill and stays walking there while the treadmill is on. Rocky sighs in relief]
Rocky: [Takes out his keycard] I knew there was a good reason to keep my gym membership. [Pats the shadow figure's back] Feel the burn, buddy. [Walks off]
The Ancient Spell of All Hallow's Eve
[As Rocky leaves, Gumball, Darwin, and Carrie are seen outside]
Carrie: See?! No one is frightened!
Gumball: [Holds up basket] Want some candy corn?
Rocky: [Takes and eats some as he is leaving] Thank you.
Carrie: Ugh! It's all about candy, candy, candy.
[A flash and a loud roar can be heard and Mr. Candy appears before them, holding up a can labeled "sweet corn" and wearing an Organic and Stuff apron.]
Mr. Candy: [Turns around] Huh? What the—
Darwin: Oh, sorry, Mr. Angry Bee Head, were you in the middle of slaying someone?
Mr. Candy: Yeah, not quite. I was, uh, stacking shelves. [Holds up the can]
Gumball: Wait, you work in a supermarket?
Mr. Candy: Yeah... but I also do a bit of bee-keeping on the side. I've got about twenty, twenty-five bees?
Gumball: Oof, that's uh... that's pretty—pretty lame.
Mr. Candy: Oh that's nothing. All the guys have had to find other works since people stopped being scared of us.
[Flashbacks to the clown in the kindergarten, whose hair is getting pulled by kids]
Mr. Candy: [Off-screen] Children's parties...
[The clown makes a balloon animal and hands it to Charlie-Ann.]
Charile-Ann: It's a little doggy!
Clown: No, it's a rat.
[Scene changes to another flashback of a masked person swinging a hedge trimmer around maniacally]
Mr. Candy: [Off-screen] Landscape gardening...
[Zooms out to show that he was creating a hedge in a shape of a swan. Harold is beside him]
Harold​​​​​​​​: Quit dancing! [Points off-screen] There's another ten peacocks and a Venus de Milo to do by lunch!
[The scene changes to the dolphin man lying downwards on a bed with only a towel covering his lower half and a hand can be seen massaging his back]
Mr. Candy: [Off-screen] ...even working as a masseuse.
Dolphin Man: Wow, you got such a light touch.
[The camera zooms out, and the masseuse is seen to be a sentient severed hand. The flashback ends]
Gumball: Man, that sucks.
Mr. Candy: But still, I can't even take a break without my supervisor—
Larry: [Off-screen] Candy, Candy, Candy!
[Mr. Candy sighs and materializes away]
Darwin: [To Gumball] Dude, it's so sad! We need to help them get their scare back.
Gumball: [To Carrie] He's right. We'll do anything. Is there a page we can light or wristband we can wear or something?
Carrie: Well, there is one thing. An ancient spell that will make everyone frightened of them again, but it needs the permission of one living being.
Gumball: Well, if I don't have to do anything, then, yeah, you've got my permission. [Carrie stares in shock] Where do I sign?
[Cuts to the inside of the Wattersons' house. A frightened Gumball and Darwin burst in as sirens can be heard outside and there is fire. Darwin, who is carrying two baskets of candy, drops them on the floor while Gumball grabs planks of wood, a hammer and nails and rapidly nails the planks up to the door]
Gumball: Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Shut the door, shut the door, shut it up!
Darwin: [Looks at the candy on the floor] This is all I can get!
Gumball: Well, that's gonna have to do, 'cause I don't think we're ever gonna be able to leave this house again!
[Gumball pulls open the curtains as they look outside. There is chaos and fire everywhere, and all the ghouls, including Carrie, are chasing, scaring and holding onto frightened civilians, and a gigantic monster is at the distance destroying helicopters. As Gumball and Darwin watch, the clown suddenly pops up behind them]
Clown: [Happily] Thanks, guys!
Gumball and Darwin: Ahh!
