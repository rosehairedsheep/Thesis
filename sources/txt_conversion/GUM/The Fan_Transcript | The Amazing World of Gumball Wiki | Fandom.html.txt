Hunched in your closet
Or strapped beneath your car
I treasured all the stories
The three of us share
Wherever you are
I'll always be there
When you were alone
I was there too
Behind the shower curtain
And you never knew
I dressed in your clothes
And breathed in your air
I watched you both sleep
And nuzzled your hair
It helps that your bedroom has places to hide
And the windows don't lock
So I can get inside
I've waited so long
To be part of your life
And one day one of you
Will call me his wife!
[The video ends, and the scene cuts to a stunned Gumball and Darwin in the classroom. They have watched it on the school TV, and they freak out for several seconds]
Gumball: I think we need to have a reasonable conversation with this young lady.
In the Hallway
[Gumball and Darwin walk along the hallway]
Darwin: Where is she? We've been looking for two hours now.
[They come across a seemingly stunned Mr. Small, paying great attention to a mural by the hallway]
Mister Small​​​​​​: Oh man… not cool…
Gumball: You okay, Mr. Small? Why are you looking at that painting that way?
Mister Small​​​​​​: [Sighs in relief] Thank mother earth! You can see it too.
Gumball: [Mouthing to Darwin] Wow.
[Mr. Small leans closer to the painting. A part of the painting that looks like an ice cream (which is obviously Sarah) opens its eyes, and startles Mr. Small. Sarah quickly closes her eyes, and continues camouflaging within the painting]
Mister Small​​​​​​: [Whispering] Did you see that?
Darwin: See what?
[Mr. Small pokes Sarah. Sarah reveals her face, and screams. Mr. Small screams, followed by Gumball and Darwin screaming. Then Mr. Small chuckles silently in relief. Sarah runs away]
Gumball: Sarah! Wait!
[The brothers take off after her trail. Sarah is trapped in the dead end of a hallway, and the brothers corner her. Sarah hears them, gasps, and pretends to be distressed as they arrive]
Gumball: Sarah, listen—
Sarah: I know what you're gonna say. I'm sorry about the hair.
Gumball: Eh-what? What hair? [He turns around, revealing a spot of shaved hear behind his head] Is there something wrong with my hair?
Sarah: Nooooo. [Smiles]
Gumball: Sarah, this whole… thing… isn't really working out.
Darwin: Yeah. It's not you. It's us.
Gumball: By which we mean it's you.
Sarah: Wait! Don't you want to see what's inside my locker?
Gumball: Is this another one of your tricks? Why would we want to see inside your locker?
Sarah: Because this is the part of the story where you realize maybe I do all this…because I'm [Sadly opens locker] lonely.
Gumball: No, Sarah. This is the part of the story where you realize there is no story, and you'll leave us alone.
Sarah: Oh. [Holding in tears] Y-yeah. Sure. [Walks away]
Darwin: Dude, look at this.
[They look at various pieces of paper in Sarah's locker. There are papers with Gumball and Darwin drawn on them]
Darwin: "The first people who spoke to me at Elmore Junior High." And this, "The coolest kids in school: Gumball and Darwin."
[Gumball sees Darwin drawn as a tall person, while he (Gumball) is dwarfed in comparison, drawn beside the tall Darwin. At this, he begins examining his size, while Darwin continues reading]
Darwin: "The only people who really know me." Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Gumball: I know right? I'm definitely taller than you! And if my eyes were that close together, I'd be a cyclops!
Darwin: No! She really cares about us, but we just pushed her away. Look at this! [Grabs book, and shows it to Gumball]
Gumball: "The Amazing Adventures of Gumball, Darwin, and Sarah." Oh man. All she ever wanted was to be included.
Darwin:[Nods sadly, then opens book] This…this is today. Here's us at lunchtime.
Gumball: Oh yeah.[Points at his hand in the drawing] Look at that hand, it's like a big thumb.
Darwin: Well, hands are difficult to draw. [Flips page] Here's us watching the video. [Flips] And here's Sarah walking off just a second ago. I wonder what happens next. [Flips page again]
Gumball: Hm. Well, whatever it is I hope she goes to art school.
Darwin: No. You say "We're her only friends, we have to do whatever it takes to make her happy."
Gumball: We're her only friends!? We have to do whatever it takes to make her happy!
[They both gasp]
Gumball: Right! How do we do it?
Darwin: Alright, here.
At the Rooftop
[Sarah leans on the edge of the school building, clearly saddened. Gumball bursts through a door]
Gumball: Sarah! You shall not be alone!
Sarah: It's alright guys. You don't have to do this.
Gumball: Yes I do, Sarah! I have been touched by the beauty of your art, and now [Blushes, and face becomes anime-style] I think I love you.
Darwin: No! You cannot love her [Glances at Sarah's book for lines] for I love her more! She's beautiful, and yellow, and runny! [Checks lines] And funny!
Sarah: Forget it guys.
[Gumball and Darwin smile encouragingly]
Gumball: Aw, come on!
Darwin: Come on.
Gumball: Come on!
Darwin: Come ooon!
Gumball: C'mooon!
Darwin: C'mon!
Gumball: C'mon!
Darwin: C'mon!
Gumball: C'mon!
Darwin: C'mon!
Gumball: C'mon!
Darwin: C'mon!
Gumball: C'mon!
[Sarah begins to smile]
Darwin: Come—
Gumball: On!
Darwin: Come—
Gumball: On!
Darwin: Come—
Gumball: On!
Sarah: [Going with the act] Please don't fight over me!
Gumball: There's no other way. You are too beautiful to be shared!
Sarah: [Excited squeal] Oh, wait. [Takes out recorder, and plays music]
[Gumball and Darwin take stances against each other, but instead jump cheerily along each other repeatedly]
Sarah: Uh guys? What are you doing?
Gumball: I don't know. It's the dancing you drew.
Sarah: That's fighting.
Gumball and Darwin: Ohhh.
[Gumball slaps Darwin, and they start slapping each other. Darwin holds Gumball's head]
Darwin: You only love her because she's beautiful! I love her because her heart shines like diamonds! [Hits Gumball]
Gumball: [Pretends to be hurt very bad, then mimics hitting Darwin with a flying kick]
Darwin: [Falls down, and pretends be hit]
Sarah: [Pleased, then stops smiling] What are you doing?
[Gumball and Darwin are hugging warmly]
Gumball: Oh, what now? It says they snuggle for a while!
Sarah: No, it says they struggle for a while.
Gumball: Well, it's not my fault your girly writing is so curly.
Darwin: [Looks through book] Dude, this is the part where you rip your shirt.
Gumball: Whaaat?
Darwin: [Shows Gumball] It's right here.
Gumball: [Sighs] Really?
Sarah: Oh yeah. It's right there.
Darwin: [In the act] Let her go, or prove that you understand true love!
Gumball: My beating heart is the only proof I need. Look!
[Attempts to rip shirt off, but fails. He struggles with it for a while, and in the end just takes it off]
Gumball: Look!
Darwin: [Checks book, and sees muscular Gumball with abs] Meh. That'll have to do. Now do your line.
Gumball: [To Sarah] You don't know how long I've waited for you!
Sarah: I don't know which path to choose!
Gumball: So real, I can feel it.
[Silence for a while. Sarah (with her eyes closed) peeks at Darwin. Darwin realizes that he missed his cue]
Darwin: What? Oh! [Glances at book; speaks in the act] NOOOOO!
[He tackles Gumball, and they "struggle" again]
Gumball: What happens next?
[Darwin flips the page of the nearby book, and they both see the next scene]
Gumball: We have to jump?
Darwin: Yeah. We're doing this for Sarah in the name of friendship.
Gumball: And pity.
Darwin: Yeah, that too.
[They run towards the building's edge]
Gumball and Darwin: Ahhhhhhh-I don't think sooo-ahhh!
[They run towards the building's external staircase instead]
Gumball and Darwin: Ahhhhhhh-
Gumball: This is much safer-ahhhh…
[Gumball and Darwin drop to the floor]
Sarah: Stop! Don't hurt yourselves for me!
Gumball: [Helps Darwin up] You okay?
Darwin: Yeah. Scratched my knee, but I'm okay.
Gumball: Good.
[They resume "fighting." Darwin pushes Gumball towards an air conditioning exhaust fan]
Gumball: You have to choose between us!
Sarah: I can't. I love you both!
Gumball: Then one of us must go!
Sarah: Hold on, I got a track for this. [Plays another music track]
[Gumball pulls Darwin, and now threatens to push him against the exhaust fan (though the fan has a protective screen). As Gumball talks, Darwin is pushed nearer to the fan]
Gumball: Goodbye, my brother. I'm sorry it had to end this way.
Darwin: It's not the end, for my love will live on forever!
Gumball: Goodbye! [Out of act] Okay, you're supposed to intervene here.
Sarah: I can't! The tape is stuck, the music won't stop.
Darwin: What!? What do we do then?
Sarah: Yeah-you-keep going! I'll be a sec.
Gumball: Are you kidding me? Do something!
Sarah: Okay. Just uh… [Fumbles with recorder] Almost got it!
[Darwin comes closer to the exhaust fan. Gumball goes to Sarah, and throes the tape away. The music is cut off]
Sarah: Stop! I can't bear to see you destroy each other.
Gumball: Okay, so what happens next?
[Darwin looks through the book]
Darwin: Hmmm… We agree that you get her at Monday through Thursday, and I get her Friday and the weekends, and we "live happily ever after."
Gumball: I think I have a better Idea.
[Gumball, takes the book, and shreds it with the exhaust fan]
Sarah: [Sings show's ending song]
Darwin: Hm?
Gumball: What is that? What are you doing?
[Episode ends]
