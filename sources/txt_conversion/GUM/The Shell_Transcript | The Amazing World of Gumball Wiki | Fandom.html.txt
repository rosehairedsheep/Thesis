School Play
[The episode opens on Elmore Junior High, which is showing a school play of Beauty and the Beast. Gumball, portraying the beast, hammily stumbles around the stage as though he is dying]
Gumball: [Gagging] Oh, my heart! Oh, it is broken! Argh! I'm going! [Strains] I'm going! Argh! Ooh! This is the end of me! [Groans] Argh! My heart! [He gurgles and babbles incoherently until abruptly stopping and falling onto the floor]
[The audience sighs in relief. Gumball starts gurgling again, much to their annoyance]
Audience: Aaah...?
[Gumball continues gagging off-screen]
Richard: [Whimpering] Is the beast gonna be all right? He just wanted to be loved!
[Anais pats Richard on the shoulder to calm him down while still reading her book]
[Gumball continues gurgling, before finally falling over with a death rattle. The lighting spotlights on Darwin, who is sweating with a nervous look on his face]
Darwin: Uuuuuuuuhhhh...
[Mr. Small reaches his arm on-screen and makes Darwin talk by moving his mouth]
Darwin: [Monotonously] When Belle came to see the Beast, she realized that she had loved him all along and cried for her lost love.
[The lighting switches back to Gumball and Penny, who is crying. Suddenly, Gumball stands up, now wearing a blonde wig in place of the beast mask]
Gumball: Thanks to your tears, Belle, the curse has been lifted!
Richard: [Stands up] They called him a beast, because he looked like a beast, but her love made him beautiful!
Penny: Yeah. Now that the fairy's curse has been lifted, we can finally seal our love, [Whispers] with a kiss!
[Gumball's face lights up and the stage falls away. Penny and Gumball are floating in space once again, like they always do when they are about to kiss. Penny readies her lips for kissing]
Gumball: Is this really happening?! 'Cause there was no kiss in rehearsals.
Penny: [Whispering] I kinda improvised.
Gumball: [Hyperventilates] Then how come we're not exploding?! We're in space! And why are we always in space when we're gonna kiss? Also—
Penny: [Whispering] Come on, hurry up. Everyone's looking.
[Camera briefly cuts to the audience. A cough can be heard]
Penny: [Whispering] Three, two, one...
[Gumball inhales deeply and accidentally headbutts Penny. The curtains subsequently close]
A Small Crack
[We cut to the dressing room. Gumball is sobbing on the floor]
Darwin: Come on, I'm sure it wasn't that bad.
Gumball: [Lifts his head up, with his face being melted] Not that bad?! If I did that in a cage fight, I'd be disqualified! [Continues sobbing with his face on the floor] This can't be happening!
Penny: Okay guys, don't panic. We don't know how bad it is yet. Come on, tell me how it looks.
[Penny reveals her eye to Gumball and Darwin. They both inhale sharply]
Gumball: Uhh... it's a nice scar. Gives you character, like a... beautiful warlord or an adorable Frankenstein, or something.
Penny: Wait, I've got a scar?!
Darwin: No, don't worry. It's not a scar, it's more of a crack!
Penny: What?! How bad is it?!
Gumball: [Speaking sweetly] Oh, no, it's cute! It's like there was a teeny-weeny really pretty earthquake in your face.
[Penny looks at herself in the mirror and examines the crack in her eye. Something yellow sparks up within it, so she quickly covers up her eye again]
Gumball: What was that?
Penny: Nothing!
Gumball: Ohh, what have I done?!
[Gumball takes Penny's hand and slaps his face with it repeatedly]
Penny: [Sighs] What are you doing?
Darwin: Hurting your head made his heart hurt, so he's hurting his head with your hand to heal his heart.
[Gumball spins Penny in her chair, making her accidentally kick Gumball. He then takes Penny's foot and slams it against his head repeatedly]
Penny: [Sighs] Look, if you really want to do something, just help me fix this.
Darwin: Hmm. Well, maybe if we put the accent on your good eye and integrate the area of discontent into the piece as a whole, no one will notice. Okay, pass me the rouge [Applies rouge to Penny's eye]. Okay, pass me the mascara [Applies mascara to Penny's eye]. Forget it, pass me the paint roller.
[Scene cuts to the outside of the room and then to Penny with a crudely drawn eye and mouth on the right side of her face]
Penny: Guys, this isn't going to work. [Softly] I'm going to have to tell my dad.
Street
[Gumball, Darwin and Penny are walking down the street at night]
Gumball: Hey, so, um, you know when you were looking at your eye and there was that... mm... what was that?
Penny: [Dismissively] Don't know what you mean.
Gumball: You know, there was that... [Makes a bubbly, crackling noise]
Penny: I have no idea what you're talking about.
Gumball: You know. The... [Babbles]
Penny: I really don't know—
Darwin: [Shouting] What's in the shell, woman?!
Penny: [Sighs] Okay. It's the... It's the real me.
Gumball: Get outta here! Can I see?
Penny: No. No one can see. My dad would go nuts.
Gumball: Don't worry, young lady. [Laughing] I am the nutcracker! [Laughs] Oh, that's funny. 'Cause I cracked your shell, and... uh... [Laughs nervously and then sighs]
[Darwin imitates a rim shot]
The Fitzgerald House
[Gumball and Penny are both flapping their tongues at each other, looking angry]
Darwin: Okay, I think you've done enough argument warm-up. Are you ready to tell her dad now?
[Gumball takes the newspaper Darwin was reading and shoots his tongue through it, making several holes]
Gumball: Yeah, I guess it's time. [Inhales deeply] No, I'm still terrified.
[Gumball and Penny start flapping their tongues again]
[Penny's father, Patrick, opens the door. Penny is facing Gumball with her back towards her father, giving the appearance of the two of them French kissing]
Patrick: Hey! What's going on here?!
[Penny gasps and covers her cracked eye, moving away]
Patrick: Penny! Where were you? We were worried sick!
Gumball: Mr. Fitzgerald! Can I call you Rob?
Patrick: No.
Gumball: Can I call you Bobby?
[Patrick grunts]
Gumball: Bobert? The Bebop? Burcher? Bobzilla? No, wait! Trebor! [Chuckles] That's Robert backwards.
Patrick: My name is Patrick.
Penny: Okay Dad, before you say anything, don't get mad.
[Penny removes her hand from her eye, revealing the crack]
Patrick: What the—?! What happened?
[Patrick steps forward]
Patrick: [To Gumball] Were you involved in this?
Darwin: I wouldn't say involved, more like directly responsi—
[Gumball grabs Darwin's tongue]
Gumball: I don't see the problem. I mean, what's inside that shell that's so scary?
Patrick: Something unstable and dangerous, and we need to fix this right now!
Gumball: HEY!
[Patrick drags Penny inside, Gumball and Darwin follow]
Penny: What if I don't want to be fixed?!
Patrick: You don't know what you want, Penny. [Turns to Gumball and Darwin, slamming his fist on a table] AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE MESSING WITH!
Gumball: [Slams his fist on the table as well, but starts shaking] How would you know?!
Penny: He's right, Dad. Everyone in the family has spent their whole lives hiding from themselves!
Patrick: Penny, you're grounded!
Penny: Ugh! [Walks away]
Patrick: [To Gumball] Now listen, you. Penny is my daughter, AND I DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR HER!
Gumball: [Suddenly stands up higher than Patrick, who staggers back] What?! So "best" is not being herself?!
[Camera zooms out, revealing Gumball standing on Darwin's shoulders. Unimpressed, Patrick pushes Gumball and Darwin out, slamming the door]
Gumball: Hey Patrick, come on! Pat! Pat-man! Patty-cakes? Let's just go.
[Gumball leaves the Fitzgerald's house, riding on Darwin]
The Watterson House
[Everyone is eating dinner. Anais feeds Nicole her food, Nicole feeds Darwin, and Darwin tries to feed Gumball, but he refuses to eat. Richard gapes at Gumball, silently motioning to be fed]
Anais: Why are we doing this again?
Nicole: Because your father is always jealous of what's on his neighbor's plate.
Anais: But why do we all have to do it?
Nicole: Because he always cries when he's the first one to finish.
Richard: Nicole! Operation Greener Grass has failed! The chain is compromised! We are losing calories! Repeat: we are losing calories!
Nicole: What's wrong, Gumball, honey? Don't you like Darwin's dinner?
Gumball: I don't wanna talk about it.
[Darwin stops eating]
Darwin: Gumball headbutted Penny, and now he's never allowed to see her again.
Gumball: I meant I don't want anybody to talk about it.
Richard: Aww, come here. [Hugs Gumball, then takes a little bite out of his food]
Penny's True Form
[Gumball walks off to his bedroom, depressed]
Nicole: You okay, honey? You had nothing to eat.
Gumball: Pft, don't worry mom! I'm a big boy, I'll be fine.
[Once inside his room, Gumball leaps onto his bed and cries. He stops when he hears and sees Penny knocking on the window of his room outside]
Gumball: Penny?
[Gumball lifts his head up, revealing a facial imprint on the pillow. He then opens the window and lets Penny in]
Penny: Thanks. Gumball, I came to… [Notices Gumball's eyes are red] Have you been crying?
Gumball: No! I just have really sweaty eyes. Wait, that's disgusting. [Sighs] Yeah, I was crying.
Penny: I came to say… I'm moving to another school. Dad thinks it's for the best.
Gumball: WHAT THE WHAT?! Excuse my French, Penny, BUT THIS IS TOTAL BAGUETTE! It is not for the best that you're forbidden—
[Nicole, Anais, Darwin and Richard are listening to them through the door. Richard's stomach growls]
Gumball: [Off-screen] —to be who you really are!
Penny: [Off-screen] But there's no other way.
Anais: Shh!
Darwin: Shh!
Nicole: Shh!
Richard: Shh! [His stomach stops growling]
Penny: [Off-screen] What do you want me to do?
[Scene changes back to the bedroom]
Gumball: Be yourself. Come out of your shell.
Penny: But maybe you wouldn't like the real me.
Gumball: There's no way that could be true. Whatever is inside, we can deal with it together.
Penny: Together?
Gumball: Together.
Penny: You're right. You're right! I'm gonna do it!
Gumball: That's it. Break free, Penny!
Penny: Okay, here we go! [Begins to glow] I'm gonna be… MYSELF!
[Penny's voice echoes and her body bursts into light as she breaks free from her shell and reveals her true form to Gumball: a golden, glowing fairy-like being with wings]
Gumball: What the what? Y-you look… you look—
Penny​​​: What? Do I look bad? [She shape-shifts into a gremlin]
Gumball: No! You look, uh—
Penny​​​: [Raspy voice] I look disgusting, don't I?!
Gumball: No, Penny, I think you look—
Penny​​​: Don't look at me! [Deep voice] I'M A MONSTER!!!
[Penny shape-shifts into an amorphous fist, breaks through the wall of Gumball's room, and flies away, now in the form of a gargoyle]
Gumball: No, Penny, wait! You look… extraordinary.
Richard: NO! It's a tragic misunderstanding that could have been really easily avoided if he just finished his sentence in time!
[Nicole slowly opens the door and the rest of the Wattersons rush into Gumball's room]
[Gumball climbs down the ladder, going after Penny]
Gumball: Penny, please wait!
Nicole: Gumball!
Chasing After Penny
[Penny shape-shifts into a jackalope. Gumball continues running after her]
Gumball: Penny! Let me finish… please stop running! My sweat marks are reaching my pants!
[Penny stops and looks back]
Gumball: Please, please…
[Gumball continues, panting and trying to finish his sentence]
Penny​: [High-pitched voice] Oh Gumball, stop trying! You've said enough. How can anyone [Transforms into a minotaur, adopting a loud, distorted voice] LOVE THIS?! [Smashes the pavement]
[Penny runs into the street, and in front of the Wilsons' car. It screeches to a halt]
Jackie​: Ah! Harold, do something!
Harold​: [Deep, serious voice] Don't worry, honey, I'll deal with this. [Opens the car door and runs away]
Jackie​​​​​​​​: [Sighs, then dials a number on her phone] Hello, is that pest control? Yeah, yeah, I need help! What does it look like? Kinda like an ugly cow on steroids but… uglier.
[Penny groans dismally and runs away]
Gumball: PENNY, COME BACK!
Penny​: I'm disgusting! I'm a disgusting pig! [Shape-shifts into a slimy, warthog-like creature]
[Gumball and Penny encounter Patrick in his car. It screeches to a halt]
Patrick: What the…? You came out of your shell.
Gumball: [Laughs nervously] I know, she looks fantastic, right?
Patrick: What have you done? You've turned her into a freak.
Gumball: A freak…ishly beautiful young lady. [Laughs nervously]
Patrick: She looks like a pig-
Gumball: -ture of beauty. Ha ha, absolutely!
Patrick: You turned my daughter into a monster!
Gumball: -truck! Of... prettiness?
[Penny shrieks as she transforms into a dragon]
Penny​: [Deep voice] Gumball, please tell my father that the monster's gone to live in the forest, with all the other beasts! [Flies away]
[Gumball turns to Patrick, with an angry expression on his face]
Patrick: What?
Gumball: [Mockingly imitates Patrick] Ohh, I wonder why my daughter is upset after I called her a freaky pig monster!
[Gumball hops on the hood of Patrick's car]
Gumball: NOW, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU TO SHUT UP! Think about what you've done! Do you realize you were wrong?! [Patrick nods] Good! But don't beat yourself up about it, parenting is hard! Now pop the hood.
[Patrick pops the hood of his car, launching Gumball up into the sky, and onto Penny]
Gumball: I'm not letting you leave!
Penny​: Gumball, no! You'll get hurt!
Gumball: Ah! Look out! AAH!
[A plane approaches them. They barely dodge it]
Gumball: Penny! Go up go up GO UP!
Penny​: You're too heavy!
Gumball: Aww, man!
[Gumball crashes into a window of the Banana's house. Penny lands on the roof]
The Bananas' House
[Gumball lands in Banana Barbara's studio, where she is painting a picture of him. Weirded out a bit, he runs into the bathroom (the scene that Banana Barbara had painted him in), startling a bathing Banana Bob]
Banana Bob​​​​​​​​: [High-pitched] AAAAH! [He puts on his mustache, and the scream deepens] AAAAH!
[Gumball bursts into Banana Joe's room, where he sees him on the computer, watching an orange being peeled. Banana Joe turns around, looking shocked, and Gumball looks back, clearly confused, and slowly closes the door. Finally, the scene cuts outside the house, where Penny is preparing to take off]
Gumball: WAIT!
[Gumball crashes out of another window, and grabs Penny's leg as she flies off again]
Penny​: Gumball, get off. Let me go!
Gumball: NOOOOOO!
[Gumball screams in terror as the two of  them are now flying hastily over the Elmore Expressway]
Pest Control
Penny​​: Why do you care? I'm nothing to you now!
[Penny is flying into the path of an oncoming truck]
Gumball: Y-you know what? Maybe you're right, you're nothing to me!
[The truck is approaching fast]
Gumball: You hear? You're nothing!
[Hurt by this remark, Penny shape-shifts into a small spirit form, which resembles her shell. Gumball catches her and tumbles under the oncoming truck]
Penny​​: [High-pitched voice; sadly] I knew it!
Gumball: No, no, no! I just said that so you'd shrink.
[Penny shape-shifts into a hairy creature and flees. A pest control van pulls up in front of Gumball]
Pest controller: Pest control! [Loads a dart gun] Outta the way!
[The pest controller aims his gun at Penny. Patrick rams his car into the pest controller's van, making him miss his shot. Penny stops and looks back for a moment before growling and getting back on her tracks]
Patrick: Hey, kid! Go get her.
[Gumball nods, and runs after her. Patrick's car's airbag suddenly deploys. The pest controller, now out of his van, loads another dart and aims at Penny. The rest of the Wattersons, in their car, block his shot, and Nicole exits the car]
Nicole: Stop! I command you to [Gets shot by a dart] stooooooop. [Goes limp]
Pest controller: Oh, creepers! I am so sorry, madam!
Nicole: [Slurring] How dare you! You shot me! Kids, help me teach this guy a lesson.
[Darwin and Anais grab her limp arm and leg, stretching them over to the pest controller, and repeatedly slap him with them]
[Richard exits the car and calls out to Gumball]
Richard: That's it, Gum-Belle! Go save the beast!
A Happy Ending
[In the forest, a wolf is heard howling]
Gumball: Penny? Penny?
[Pushing aside some branches, he finds Penny, now in the form of a wolf, and walks towards her. Penny grunts, knowing he has found her]
Gumball: You know I… I-I was trying to protect you back there.
Penny​: [Deep, rasping voice] Yes, I know.
Gumball: And you know why?
Penny​: Yes, I know why. But just look at me, what will you think when people laugh at us?
Gumball: No offense, but you kiiinda looked like a big coconut with holes in it before.
Penny​: But do you really think you could love… [Bares teeth and growls] THIS?!
Gumball: That's not what you are, it's just how you feel. [Whispers] And this is how I feel…
[Gumball grabs Penny and kisses her on the lips. Penny's eyes widen in surprise and she lets out a small gasp. As they kiss, the space background reappears and Penny morphs back through all her previously seen forms in reverse chronological order until she is back to her base form. Finishing the kiss, they stare at each other affectionately. Richard (in the background with the rest of the Wattersons and Patrick, watching them happily) vocalizes the music, heavenly]
Richard: [In tears of happiness] She was a monster! [Sniffs] But he made her beautiful… [Sniffs] …with his love [Sniffs] …like in their play, but backwards!
Anais: Yeah, I kinda think we all got that, Dad.
