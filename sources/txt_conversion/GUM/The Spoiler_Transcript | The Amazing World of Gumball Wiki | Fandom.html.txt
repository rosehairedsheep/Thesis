In Gumball and Darwin's Room
[Episode begins with Gumball tying a string around one of his teeth.]
Darwin: Dude, what are you doing?
Gumball: Well, I need money and the tooth fairy will provide.
Darwin: What about your allowance?
Gumball: I spent it on this bow and arrow.
[Gumball picks up the bow and fires the arrow out the window. The string around his tooth is attached to the arrow, and its coiled-up length on the floor below the window begins to unravel.]
Darwin: You do realize those are your adult teeth, right?
[Gumball gasps and frantically tries to untie his tooth, but fails. He is pulled off his feet face-first into the edge of the window pane and falls to the floor with his face dented in.]
Darwin: What do you need the money for, anyway?
Gumball: For the movies. [Face goes back to normal] Which of my organs do you think is the least useful? [Lifts up shirt] How much do you think a nipple would go for?
Darwin: What movie would be worth losing your ability to make cheese?!
Gumball: First, I think you still have a lot to learn about us mammals. And secondly, we're talking about The Screamening! It's the only movie in ten years that's not a remake, a sequel, a remake of a sequel, or a prequel of a sequel of a remake!
Darwin: Really?! Time to dig into the money my biological parents left me!
Gumball: How can you inherit money from a couple of goldfish?
[Darwin retrieves a small treasure chest from his bowl and opens it in front of Gumball, releasing several bubbles.]
Darwin: Oooh!
[Gumball carefully pushes the bubbles back down into the chest.]
Gumball: Maybe you should save these and invest them in the future. It's what they would have wanted.
Darwin: Then, where are we gonna get the money?
[The bedroom door suddenly opens with a loud bang. In the doorway stands Anais, bouncing a fat, pink, rattling piggy bank in her hand.]
Anais: I have money.
Gumball: [Taken aback] Oh. [Quietly] Awkward. [Laughs nervously] I–I guess this was bound to happen one day. [Inhales and puts hands together] Actually, you don't have any money. Your piggy bank is filled with nails.
Darwin: [Equally nervously] Toenails.
[In shock and disgust, Anais drops the piggy bank, which shatters on the floor.]
Anais: EUUGH!!
Darwin: And we replaced the money you stashed under the mattress with IOU's because we can't afford to pay you back.
Gumball: And I'm sorry about your college fund.
Anais: But, you didn't know about–-
Gumball and Darwin: The safe?
Anais: [Sighs, then brightens up] Well, at least you don't know about the thirty dollars mom just gave me. What–what?!
[Anais finds her hands empty and sees her brothers holding her allowance, laughing merrily.]
Gumball: This is perfect! [Gasps] I'll pay you back!
Anais: You don't have to pay me back.
Gumball: I don't?
[Gumball dances in joy until Anais swipes the thirty dollars from his hand.]
Anais: On one condition: you take me with you.
Gumball: No way. You're way too young. You'd freak the wig out.
Anais: [Deep voice] Oh, you don't think I can take it?
Gumball: [Deep voice] Oh, I know you can't take it.
Anais: [Deep voice] You better believe I can take it.
Darwin: [Deeper voice] Why are you guys talking in scary voices?
Gumball: [Normal voice] 'Cause, it's a scary movie, dude.
Darwin: [Normal voice] A scary movie?!
Anais: [Normal voice] If you don't take me, you don't get the money.
Gumball: Fine. I'll just wait 'til the end of the week when I get my allowance.
Anais: Ha! Good luck avoiding the spoilers until then.
Gumball: Well, good luck trying to think of a comeback to this.
[Gumball performs a dance of mockery and Anais leaves.]
In the School Bus
Darwin: So... when you said it was a scary movie, did you mean scary like thinking you left your lunchbox at home and then, realizing you have it, or really scary, like when you're blowing up a balloon and you're worried it might pop?
Gumball: Yeah, I think it's more like being chained to a bear in a free-falling airplane without parachutes that's filled with vampire bats… on fire.
[Darwin whimpers and Tobias emerges from behind their seats.]
Tobias​​​: Have you guys seen The Screamening? Ah, it's great! Especially when the dentist–-
[Gumball quickly pulls Tobias' headband down around his mouth.]
Gumball: Hey! No spoilers! [Pushes Tobias back down] Ugh, I need to forget that. Clear me.
[Darwin shakes Gumball like an Etch-A-Sketch and his face disappears. Then, he grabs Gumball's ears and redraws his face, albeit poorly.]
Gumball: [Distorted voice] Didn't work, but thanks anyway.
Avoiding More Spoilers
[The outside of the school is shown and the lunch bell rings. The scene cuts to Gumball and Darwin in the cafeteria, gathering food for their trays.]
Gumball: Okay. I just need to get through the week and get my allowance without learning anything about The Screamening. Right?
Darwin: Right!
[They sit at a table with Leslie, Banana Joe, Juke and Anton, and Gumball prepares to dig into his hot dog.]
Darwin: Hey guys! Has anyone seen The Screamening?
[Startled by Darwin's words, Gumball slams his fist down and accidentally squeezes the hot dog out of the bun. It lands in the mouth of Hot Dog Guy, who chokes and soon falls over]
Gumball: Dude!
Darwin: I'm sorry. I just need to prepare myself mentally. It's the suspense I can't handle.
Gumball: Can't handle suspense, huh? Then, you're really not gonna like it when I–-
[Gumball jumps up onto the table and poses as if to attack Darwin, but freezes.]
Darwin: What?!
Gumball: [Sits back down and whispers] To be continued.
Darwin: Noooooooo!
Leslie​​​​: Pssst! This is in the movie.
[Leslie sticks two hot dogs inside his mouth like vampire teeth. He sways and undulates his body and leafy arms with a ghostly moan.]
Darwin: Is it about vampires?
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​: No, dude. It's about a dentist.
[Gumball growls angrily]
Darwin: Never mind. Sorry.
[Banana Joe clears his throat to get Gumball and Darwin's attention. On the table rests his severed head, wearing spaghetti noodles for hair. His body repeatedly stabs the head with a fork as his head silently pretends to scream.]
Darwin: Does someone, uh…
Banana Joe: [Whispers] Oh, yeah. The dentist's wife is a hairdresser.
[Gumball slams his hands down on the table to silence everyone.]
Juke: Pssst!
[Juke sets his plate down in front of Darwin and moves his peas around with his fork, demonstrating more elements of the movie's plot]
Darwin: [Gasps] The dentist and the hairdresser inherit a remote cabin in the woods from their crazy uncle, but they found out it's on an ancient cowboy burial ground, and their car breaks down–-
Gumball: Alright! That's it!
[Gumball quickly eats Juke's peas and walks around the table, wolfing down Leslie and Banana Joe's lunches, too. He also tosses away Joe's plate, which hits the Green Bear at another table.]
Gumball: No more spoilers!
Anton: Actually, there was a dinner scene which very closely resembles the one–-
[Gumball puts Anton facedown on his own ham sandwich, and to the others' horror, he silences Anton by eating him.]
Back at Home
[Sitting on the living room sofa, Gumball opens up his laptop.]
Gumball: Let's see what people are up to on Elmore Plus. [Types] Ah, Carrie.
[He reads a post by Carrie.]
Gumball: "If I was a certain mom-to-be, I wouldn't follow my husband down the cellar steps." #ghostsinthebasement  #winkwink  #spoileralert"? AAH! [Shouts while typing] What kind of lard-brained punk writes spoiler alert AFTER giving out the spoiler?! #YOU!
[Gumball posts his comment and Masami instantly replies. He reads this aloud, too.]
Gumball: "Wow! Chill out, Gumball. You're going crazier than the wife when she sees what's down the–-" Aah!
[Gumball roars with a demonic face and his head spins completely around on his neck.]
Gumball: [Speaks dramatically while typing] That's it! Darn you all! I curse your ancestors and your descendants!
[Gumball hears Gary speaking in a creepy, demonic-sounding language and looks to see him staring through the mail slot with malicious, red eyes. Startled, Gumball instinctively backs away from him, accidentally knocking his laptop onto the floor.]
Gumball: What the what, dude?!
Gary: Well, I was just finishing your quote from The Screamening. It's scratched into the cellar door, right?
[Gumball throws a book, a plate and a pillow at the door to silence Gary and make him go away, but Gary still lingers. Gumball shouts in frustration, but Anais, who has calmly come downstairs, closes the mail slot cover on Gary's fingers, making him cry out in pain.]
Gumball: Thank you!
Anais: Don't mention it. So... I was just in the kitchen. I slipped and kinda accidentally baked this cake with chocolate writing on it that says "Gumball is Awesome." Do you want a slice?
Gumball: [Puts his hand to his chin and thinks] Hmm. This is highly suspicious. [Aloud] But, on the other hand, [Sings] C-a-a-a-ake!
[Gumball at once digs a chunk out of the cake and chows down merrily. But he suddenly starts choking and beats on his chest until a yellow MP3 player with headphones comes out of his mouth. He catches it and looks at it.]
Anais: Oh, yeah. And it's all yours! How does it taste?
Gumball: [Chuckles and gives Anais a goofy smile.] Decibelicious.
Anais: [Fakes a laugh] Ah, you're so funny. Hey, wanna watch some TV?
[She turns on the TV, which is airing a show similar to Pokemon.]
Anais: So, will you take me to the movie this weekend?
[The show is interrupted for an instant as the word "YES" flashes on the screen.]
Gumball: No.
Anais: What?! What about the subliminal message?!
Gumball: Sorry, I don't understand Japanese.
Anais: Oh, come on!
Gumball: Look. I don't want my little sister to be traumatized, 'kay?
Anais: This is girl-ist!
Gumball: What? No! It's because you're four!
Anais: Well, then, it's age-ist!
Gumball: No! It's sister-who'll-be-so-freaked-out-by-seeing-the-movie-that-she'll-be-a-pain-in-the-butt-for-a-month-ist!
[Anais wraps her arm around Gumball's head and pulls him closer so that their cheeks touch. They stare into each other's eyes.]
Anais: [Softly] Gumball, I've already witnessed all the horror this world can muster.
Gumball: [Whispers in concern] What did you see?
Anais: [Echoing voice] I've seen a beast gorging on a thousand lambs in the darkness of his lair.
Gumball: Dude, we've all seen Dad eating a kebab in bed before.
Anais: I've been to the swimming pool with Granny Jojo.
[Gumball cringes at the thought.]
Anais: See? I can take it. Try me.
Gumball: [Softly] Okay, okay. I'm going to try and scare you, okay? Be prepared, 'cause you just don't know when it's–-
[A photo of a live piranha flashes on screen.]
Piranha: Aaaaaah!
[Anais, who has frozen in terror and paled several shades, falls on her side like a statue, squishing the cake. Gumball, meanwhile, watches with a mischievous grin.]
Gumball: [Laughs] Knew it.
Phone Conversation
[In his bedroom, Gumball talks with Penny on his cell phone.]
Gumball: No, honestly. We need an extension to the police motto. It should say "To protect and to serve and to tase people who ruin movies for others."
Penny: [Chuckles] Don't worry. I wont reveal anything. I mean, who'd even want to know that the dentist–-
Gumball: No no no no no, please! Don't!
Penny: [Amused] I'm just messing with you.
Gumball: Yeah, thanks.
Penny: The dentist is actually–-
Patrick: The one who unleashed the evil spirits! Haha!
Penny: Dad! Are you eavesdropping on us?!
Patrick: Uh, oh. Uh. [Imitates dead phone tone] Toooooo–
Gumball: That was a real spoiler too, wasn't it?
Patrick: [Still pretending] Yes, it was. Sorry– oooooo…
Darwin: Do you have any other spoilers, please?
Gumball: Is anyone else eavesdropping!?
Nicole, Richard, Anais, John, and Polly: Yup.
Polly: It's still worth seeing the film, though.
Gumball: Really?
Polly: At least for the special effects when the demons are released from the cellar!
Anais: [Indignant] Wait, she was allowed to see it?!
Gumball: [Irritated] Alright. Bye, everyone!
In the Backyard
[Gumball is digging a hole.]
Darwin: Dude, what are you doing now?
Gumball: Digging a hole to put my head in.
Darwin: With your head, it would be easier to put it in an empty swimming pool.
Radio: And now, it's competition time! This week's big question is all about– [Scream sound effects] You guessed it! The Screamening! And, our big question is– [Scream sound effects] why is it called The Screamening? Looks like our first caller.
Rocky [On radio]: Uh, hi. My name's Rocky Robinson.
[Gumball walks away carrying the shovel.]
Rocky [On radio]: It's called The Screamening because–-
[Rocky is silenced by a shovel hitting him.]
Radio: Rocky, are you there? Oh, never mind. We have another caller on line two!
[Gumball comes back, satisfied.]
Billy [On radio]: Yes. The Screamening is a portmanteau of the words "scream" and "awakening," which is the sound the dentist makes when his wife gives birth to a demon baby.
[Gumball screams terribly from raw frustration.]
Billy [On radio]: Yes, just like that.
[Gumball buries his head in the hole.]
Darwin: By the way, why didn't you just turn off the radio?
[Gumball screams again.]
Movie Time
[The calendar displays the twenty-sixth day of the month.]
Gumball: Finally! It's Saturday. Check!
[Thirty dollars are shown.]
Gumball: Got my allowance? Check!
[A bag of popcorn and other candies are shown next.]
Gumball: Affordable candy 'cause the stuff at the movies is a total rip-off? Check!
[A blanket, mittens, and a beanie are shown.]
Gumball: Blankets, because they always go nuts with the air-conditioning? Check!
[Hair tools are shown.]
Gumball: Clippers in case someone with big hair sits in front of us. Check!
[A red carpet and other things are shown.]
Gumball: A red carpet to make us feel special? Check!
[With all these things in a backpack, and with headphones muffling his ears, Gumball blindfolds himself.]
Gumball: I'm ready to see the film and I'm spoiler-proof for the journey! Here we go!
[Gumball walks around bumping into things until he finally stops to remove the blindfold. When he finds the door, he puts the blindfold back on, and consequently, when he opens the door, it hits him and knocks him down.]
[The scene cuts to the cinema, where the movie is just beginning. The audience is shown watching intently, and they are startled by something in the film.]
Darwin: I knew that was going to happen.
[Darwin lip-syncs the characters' lines.]
Woman [Movie]: Honey, come home from the surgery, quick. I got a call from your mysterious uncle. He's leaving us his cabin!
Man [Movie]: But, honey! We don't need a house. I'm just a simple dentist.
[Unnoticed by Gumball and Darwin, a silent, pink hand emerges from the backpack, holding a camcorder.]
Gumball: How do you know every single line of a film?
Darwin: Well, I knew I would be terrified when I saw it. So, yesterday, I decided to watch it... before I watch it.
Gumball: [Sighs] Whatever. [Grabs popcorn]
[As Gumball and Darwin share the popcorn, Anais' other hand reaches across like a snake and takes some from the bag as well, much to Gumball's bewilderment.]
Man [Movie]: Relax, honey! We'll be there soon.
Gumball: What the what?
Pantsbully: Would you please be quiet? I'm trying to have a phone conversation here! [On phone] Yeah, yeah. There's some kid. Carry on.
[Gumball reaches into the backpack and pulls Anais up by her ears.]
Darwin: Anais, what are you doing?
Anais: What does it look like I'm doing?
Gumball: Pirating a movie!
Anais: No, I'm not! I bought a ticket online, so I paid to be here. I'm just taking the movie home to watch by myself, like a doggy bag.
[Gumball grunts in irritation, but has no response.]
Gumball: Actually, I can't see anything wrong with that.
Darwin: I still get the feeling she shouldn't be doing it, but why?
[Gumball, Darwin and Anais put their hands to their chins and ponder.]
Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: Hmm.
Man [Movie]: It's in the bush. It's coming!
Woman [Movie]: [Screams]
[Through the movie house doors, Larry sees Anais with her camera and bursts into the room.]
Larry: Hey! Movie piracy is a federal offense!
[Anais and Darwin gasp. Gumball snaps and points two finger guns, with which he motions to the floor, signaling his siblings to duck with him under the seats. In the darkness, they crawl across the floor until they encounter something unseen and gross.]
Gumball: Aw, man. It's fossilized soda.
Darwin: Oh no! Does this mean we're stuck to the floor because the dried cola is so sticky it's like superglue, and then our clothes will get stuck to it and we'll have to run naked through the theater, leading to all sorts of shenanigans?
Gumball: [Inhales] Not really. It's more of a minor inconvenience.
Anais: Just keep going. He's right behind us!
Man [Movie]: It's right behind us! Faster!
[They scurry across the popcorn-covered floor, becoming covered in the kernels, until Larry's flashlight beam lands squarely on them. They turn at once and freeze with a gasp of terror. But the camouflage the kernels provide successfully blinds Larry to their presence, and he steps over them as he continues his search.]
Gumball: Haha! We're lucky that Larry's IQ is as small as his paycheck!
[Larry hears him and points his flashlight at him.]
Gumball: Why doesn't the whole room ever go silent when I come up with a good bur–
[Gumball's words are cut off as Darwin pulls him away. He, Anais, and Darwin scramble through the rows of seats and encounter noisy audience members. To restore silence, Gumball takes Pantsbully's phone, slaps Jackie's tapping fingers, slaps Harold on the back to cure his cough, and takes Julius' drink to stop his slurping. They soon reach a dead end.]
Darwin: It's a dead end. What'll we do?
Gumball: We use the folding seats like a diving board to propel ourselves up to the fire exit. Like this.
[Gumball opens an untaken seat and tries to jump onto it, but the seat closes and he ends up sandwiched in it.]
Darwin and Anais: Gumball!
Gumball: You guys go... and leave me behind.
Darwin: [Quietly] Nooo!
Gumball: And go give yourselves up.
Darwin and Anais: What?!
Gumball: Well, at least one of us can make it.
Anais: And why should it be you?!
Darwin: Listen, Gumball. I have an idea, but you're not gonna like it.
[Larry approaches.]
Woman [Movie]: It's the baby! It's coming!
Gumball: Just do it. Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
[Darwin hops up on top of a seat and announces to the entire audience...]
Darwin: The demon baby was just a figment of his imagination because the dentist has seven split personalities and every character in the movie was him!
[Everyone groans in frustrated disappointment. Gumball, Anais, and Darwin blend in with the crowd as they leave the room.]
Woman [Movie]: Honey, look. Say hello to your beautiful new baby.
[Anais returns to peek through the door, excited to get a glimpse of the demon baby. But when she sees it and hears its hideous scream, her smile turns to a look of abject terror.]
The Ending
[Gumball and Darwin are sitting together on a bench outside the theater with ice cream cones in their hands. Darwin sighs as his brother disinterestedly licks his treat.]
Darwin: I'm sorry, man. Here. [Offers ice cream] You can hit me if you like.
Gumball: Dude. You saved me from a HUGE disappointment. That movie had the worst ending in the galaxy. Also, I got my money back, so all's well that ends well. Right, sis?
[Sitting with them is Anais, pale and paralyzed with terror, her face frozen in a scream without sound. Gumball gives her a "lick" of his ice cream and the episode ends with him rubbing and smearing his ice cream all over her silent, petrified face.]
