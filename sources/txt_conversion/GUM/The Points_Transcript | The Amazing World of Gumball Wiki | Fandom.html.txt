Playing Galaktrek
[The episode starts with Gumball and Darwin playing on one of the computers in the school library]
Anais: Hey, are you two finally studying...or are you playing Corn Farm?
Gumball: Ugh, neither. Because Corn Farm is for plebs who like to get ripped off spending real money on a virtual pig to go with their windmill. We're playing Galaktrek, and we're about to buy a virtual space hog to go with our solar generator.
Anais: What's the difference here?
[Explosions and pig squeals can be heard coming from the computer]
Gumball and Darwin: Violence.
Gumball: [Sighs] Right, nothing new is happening here. We need to buy the photon blaster.
Darwin: But we can't! We're out of cosmic points. [Gasps] Look out! We're under attack!
[The computer shows their planet being destroyed]
Gumball: But who could be doing this?
[Tobias laughs evilly]
Gumball: Not now, Tobias. We're trying to figure out who's destroying our planet.
Tobias​​: That what's my smug laugh was about. It is I who is destroying your planet.
[Tobias points to his screen, and then to theirs, displaying their planet exploding]
Gumball: W-T-W, dude?! How did you get the hadron laser?
Tobias​​: I bought it. For two million cosmic points.
Gumball: Two million cosmic points?!
Tobias​​: Which I bought for five dollars.
Gumball: Five dollars?!
Tobias​​: Which I bought for one good point.
Gumball: One good point?!
Darwin: What are good points?
Gumball: I don't know! What are good points?!
Tobias​​: They're points I get for doing chores for my parents.
Gumball: Chores for your parents?!
Tobias​​: Yes?
Gumball: Yes?!
Tobias​​: Okay... Well, I'm kinda busy with Galaktrek at the moment, so, uh, how about you do my chores for me, I give you the good points, and then you can buy whatever you want for the game.
Gumball: Hm.
Tobias​​: Hello?
Gumball: Sorry. I kinda peaked too early with excitement. Yeah, we'll do it.
The First Chore
[Gumball and Darwin are sneaking through the school hallway]
Darwin: Why do we have to break in here?
Gumball: Because Tobias wants us to get him an A in science, and we're clearly not good enough.
[Gumball gestures towards the door of the science lab; the hallway is filled with green fumes, and several students are passed out on the floor]
Gumball: So, we have to break into the teachers' office and change his grades directly on their computer.
[Gumball shapes his finger into a paper clip, then unwinds it to pick the lock on the door]
Gumball: Aha!
Darwin: But why are we breaking in here?
Gumball: What do you mean?
[Gumball opens the door and sees Rocky spraying cheese fizz in his own mouth]
Darwin: Because this is the broom closet.
[Gumball and Darwin enter the teachers' office]
Gumball: Shh! [Scats, then breaks a lamp] Shh! [Scats, then knocks a plant off of the top of the fridge and breaks it] Shh!
[Gumball continues scatting, then goes under the table, tipping a vase off of it. Darwin gasps, then catches the vase and sighs with relief. Gumball screams loudly, causing Darwin to drop the vase and break it]
Gumball: Shh! Right. All I have to do is initiate the power supply to the hard drive and engage the mainframe protocol.
Darwin: How?
[Gumball turns on the computer]
Darwin: Good. Now find the Tobias file.
[Gumball opens the file]
Gumball: [Sighs] Darn. It's a PFD, we can't edit it.
Darwin: What are we gonna do?
Gumball: Pass me that crayon.
[Gumball draws a line on the screen to make the "F" look like an "A."]
Gumball and Darwin: Mmm-hmm.
[Cut to Tobias, who is now pale and looks sleep-deprived playing Galaktrek in the library]
Tobias​​: More, I need more...!
Gumball: Mission accomplished!
Tobias​​: Oh, very good! Well, here are your good points. [Hands an invisible good point to Gumball]
Gumball: For real?
Tobias​​: Y-yeah?
Gumball and Darwin: OHH! WE JUST GOT PAID! [Throw the good points in the air, laughing]
Gumball: Look at all this money!
[Gumball and Darwin hurriedly pick up the good points]
Tobias​​: So, are you guys up for more work? 'Cause I got plenty more for you!
[Gumball and Darwin gasp]
Tobias​​: [Points down at the floor] You missed one.
Darwin: Oh. [Picks it up and puts it in his invisible pocket]
Gumball: Alright, but the price just went up. Now it's twenty invisible good points!
Tobias​​: Hmm, uh... Okay.
Darwin: And it's ten upfront! The rest on delivery. We're no suckers.
Tobias​​: Alright, alright. You drive a hard bargain, young man.
[After Tobias hands Darwin more invisible points, the sound of stretching elastic is heard as he puts the money away]
Tobias​​: What was that?
Darwin: I put the money in my invisible pants.
Tobias​​: Right... Well, my dad wants the lawn taken care of.
Gumball: Hm, go on...
Tobias​​: As in, he wants the weeds taken out.
Gumball: Hm, go on...
Tobias​​: Th-that's it. Take out the weeds.
Gumball: Go on.
Tobias​​: I literally can't be any clearer.
Gumball: Go on-
Tobias​​: You go on!
Gumball: Okay.
[Tobias sighs and goes back to playing Galaktrek]
Doing More Chores
[In front of Tobias' house, Gumball sprays the grass with herbicide, killing it]
Darwin: What are you doing?
Gumball: I'm killing the weeds.
Darwin: Are you kidding me?! He explained six times that he wanted his lawn taken care of, not taken out!
Gumball: Well, he never specifically said the grass had to grow back.
Darwin: Fair point. You did give him plenty of opportunities to be more specific.
[Darwin takes the herbicide and sprays it. Later, Gumball and Darwin are seen in the school library, rolling on the floor laughing]
Darwin: We're rich!
Tobias​​: When you guys are done rolling around in it, can you please get back to work? I'm under attack here!
Gumball: Wow, dude. How did you get the galactic exoskeleton?
Tobias​​: Doesn't matter! Listen, I need you guys to wax my...dad- [Gumball and Darwin make horrified faces] -'s car. [They sigh in relief] Sorry, I've been playing this game for thirty-eight hours, so I'm starting to train my lose of thought.
Gumball: What?
Tobias​​: You heard me. On get with it!
[Gumball and Darwin are in front of Tobias' house, waxing the car with hair removal wax]
Darwin: You have to admit, it's kinda weird to ask us to wax a car.
Gumball: Hey, man, we're labor, not management. [Rips off the wax, which rips off the metal on the car door. Walks towards the back of the car] Sorry, this might hurt a little.
[Gumball goes under the car and waxes it from underneath. Back to the library, an exhausted Tobias hands good points to Gumball]
Tobias​​: ...forty-nine, and fifty.
Gumball: Dude, are you feeling okay? You look like a crab without a shell.
Tobias​​: I'd like to see what you'd look like if you got breakfast, lunch, and dinner from a vending machine. I got more work for you.
Darwin: Uh, I think we have enough invisible money, thank you.
Tobias​​: Maybe you'll change your mind when you get a load of this.
[Tobias opens an empty briefcase as Gumball and Darwin watch in awe]
Tobias​​: Oh, yeah.
[A montage shows Gumball and Darwin performing chores poorly as Tobias' state deteriorates. In the library, Tobias signs an invisible check and hands it to Gumball]
Gumball: Uh-uh-uh! Cash only.
[Tobias sighs and walks towards a bookshelf]
Tobias​​: [Imitates ATM]
Gumball: What's that?
Tobias​​: Invisible ATM.
Gumball and Darwin: Oooh.
Tobias​​: Do you mind?
[They look away as Tobias "types" his PIN. Gumball and Darwin are then seen doing more chores]
Gumball: Hey! We're done.
[Tobias grunts and throws invisible money at them]
Gumball: High five?
[Tobias makes a weak attempt to high five Gumball, then shoos them. The brothers resume their chores, and, unknown to them, Tobias' house catches fire]
Telling the Truth
[Gumball and Darwin return to the library once again]
Gumball: We would like to redeem our good points, please.
[Tobias, who looks extremely sleep-deprived, snarls]
Darwin: Sorry, could you repeat that?
Tobias​​​​: That's not gonna be possible.
Gumball: What?! Why?
Tobias​​​​: [Sighs] I used my parents' credit card to buy stuff in the game, and I used you to do chores and gain an advance on my good points. But it's gotten out of control, I got tricked by Galaktrek – I bought every single end-game purchase possible.
Gumball: How much did you spend?
Tobias​​​​: Uh...numbers we haven't learned at school yet.
Gumball: Well, make one up so we can get an idea.
Tobias​​​​: Um... [Counts on his fingers] A quadrillion dollars.
[Gumball and Darwin gasp]
Darwin: But what about all those invisible good points you gave us?
Tobias​​​​: [Sighs] There never were any good points. I switched the real ones for nothing but thin air.
[Shocked, Gumball and Darwin remember all the times they played with the invisible money]
Gumball: Gosh, you're right! There was nothing there all along!
Darwin: You've hit rock bottom, man!
Tobias​​​​: Do you know what rock bottom is?! Rock bottom is getting a kid to organize your mom's underwear drawer just so you can afford to buy your space cowboy a new umbrella!
Darwin: If you don't redeem our good points, then we're gonna have to take this to the top. We're gonna go speak to–
Gumball: –the President of the United States of America.
Darwin: No, dude, his parents.
Gumball: The parents of the President of the United States of–
Darwin: Tobias' parents!
Tobias​​​​: I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
[Tobias arms an invisible gun]
Gumball: What's that?
Tobias​​​​: My invisible shock rifle. Remember? I bought all the weapons.
[Gumball and Darwin run through the hallway as Tobias shoots in their direction]
Darwin: What are we gonna do?! He's got lasers!
Gumball: Maybe, but we have a laser copier.
[Gumball jumps onto a laser copier and presses a button. A sheet of paper comes out of it]
Gumball: Yeah, I don't know why I thought that would work.
Darwin: The name makes it sound more hardcore than it is.
[Gumball and Darwin start running again]
Tobias​​​​: You think you can outrun me? Well, try to outrun my portal gun. [Switches between guns] Darn, missed it. Gotta cycle through again.
[Tobias switches to his portal gun, then shoots a portal above Gumball and another one underneath him, causing him to fall through an infinite loop]
Gumball: Darwin!
[Darwin and Tobias fight for the gun, sending Gumball flying in various directions until he bumps into them]
Darwin: Quick! His parents are only two blocks down!
Tobias​​​​: It'll look much further after I've used my shrink gun.
[Tobias shoots, causing Gumball and Darwin to scream as they shrink. He then prepares to stomp them, but is interrupted by a confused Anais]
Anais: What are you doing?
[Cut to reality, where Gumball and Darwin have not really been shrunken by the shrink gun. Gumball is seen holding Tobias' foot while crouched down with his feet tucked into his shirt. Darwin is on his knees, and his knees are in his shoes]
Gumball: [High-pitched voice] Tobias robbed us of our invisible points and shrunk us with a space gun because we were gonna tell his parents. Help us!
Anais: I might not be a qualified psychiatrist, but I'll try anyway. You do realize that none of this is real, right?
Gumball: [Normal voice] You know what that means?
Anais: Yes, you can stop acting like a loon and walk normally down the road to Tobias' house.
Gumball: No. It means we can imagine any weapon we want as well!
[They run again. Anais, frustrated over how Gumball realizes the solution, sighs and walks away]
Gumball: Darwin, quick! Think of something awesome!
Darwin: Huh...aha! [Holds up a invisible object in the air]
Gumball: What is it?
Darwin: A stick.
[A laser beam shot by Tobias grazes Gumball and Darwin]
Gumball: You're gonna need to think of something much bigger.
[Darwin throws an invisible object at Tobias, crushing him]
Gumball: What was that?
Darwin: A much bigger stick.
[Tobias catches up with Gumball and Darwin, who readied their invisible guns]
Tobias​​​​: No... How did you get the flak cannon and the railgun?
Gumball: The question is: how are you gonna survive them?
[Gumball and Darwin fire at Tobias in slow motion, "killing" him. They then slowly approach a "dying" Tobias]
Tobias​​​​: Come closer. Closer...
[Tobias places something in Gumball's hand]
Gumball: What is it?
Tobias​​​​: Pin.
Gumball: Pin for what?
Tobias​​​​: Plasma grenade.
[Tobias holds up an invisible grenade; Gumball and Darwin attempt to run away, but they are caught in the imaginary explosion, but they soon come to a strict halt by the voice of Harold]
Harold​​​​: Hey!
Tobias​​​​: Sorry, but we're in the middle of a plasma explosion here?
Harold​​​​: No, you're not. I just had to block my credit card after you spent fifteen thousand dollars on made-up video game weapons! They've closed your game account!
Tobias​​​​: Oh.
[Gumball and Darwin flop onto the ground]
Harold​​​​: Get in the house. [Gasps] What the...?
[They all turn to the house, which is on fire]
Harold​​​​: What happened?!
Darwin: Sorry, sir. We were doing Tobias' chores for good points.
Harold​​​​: And how are you gonna pay for the damage?
Gumball: Do you take any currency?
Harold​​​​: I guess. What choice do I have?
Gumball: Very well. [Counting invisible money, while Tobias stares in horrified shock] Ten Watterson dollars, twenty Watterson dollars, thirty Watt–
Darwin: Oh, that's a five.
Gumball: –twenty-five Watterson dollars—
