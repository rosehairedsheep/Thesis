I Can't Eat
[Gumball and Darwin are sitting at a table in the cafeteria, with Carrie next to them. Gumball and Darwin eat their food and are both pleased by its flavor. Gumball gives Darwin a try of his food, and Darwin does the same]
Carrie: [Sighs] That's just so insensitive. You know ghosts can't eat. [Eats a lump of food, it falls through her body back onto the plate; she sighs] Watching you two at lunchtime makes my afterlife a misery.
Gumball: But Carrie, you like being miserable.
Carrie: That's not the point. I'm hungry.
Gumball: So, why do you come to the cafeteria every day?
Carrie: Because it brings out the only feeling I have left: [Sighs and flips her hair] pain.
Gumball: [Looks sad for a moment, then cheerfully] Can I have your lunch then?
Carrie: [Sighs] Whatever. [Gumball starts eating it] I wish I still had a body.
Darwin: Why don't you use Gumball's?
Gumball: [Spits the food out] What? Me?
Carrie: Really? You would do that for me?
Darwin: Sure! Gumball's always there for a friend in need.
Gumball: I am?
Carrie: Great! Thanks!
Gumball: No, wait!
[Carrie possesses Gumball's body]
Carrie: Rrrrrrr! [Raspy voice] I can breathe! [Grabs food] I can feel! I can eat!! [Eats] Nom, nom! [Grabs Darwin's face] I need more!
[Carrie throws Darwin on the floor and walks through the cafeteria, scaring all the students. She leaves the cafeteria, suddenly a girlish scream heards behind the door]
Darwin: Another happy ending!
First Eating Rampage
[Heavy metal music plays in the background as Gumball, possessed by Carrie, runs to Joyful Burger, throws money to Larry, eats all the food, grabs a burger, takes a pickle out from the burger before eating it. Then she runs to the dumpster, takes a turkey leg from the Hobo, eats all the hot dogs from Pantsbully's hot dog cart. Then, the Doughnut Sheriff arrives, and Carrie bites him]
Donut Sheriff: Ow! [Into his walkie-talkie] We've got a man down! We've got a man down!
[Gumball, possessed, runs away, and the scene cuts to black]
At the Street
[Gumball wakes up on the sidewalk in front of his house, surrounded by junk food. Darwin and Richard come up to him]
Gumball: [Groans]
Richard: There you are! What happened?
Darwin: It was Carrie! She made Gumball go on a crazy junk food spree.
Richard: You got to eat all that food? Awesome!
Gumball: No, it wasn't. [His belly and chest jiggle]
Richard: [Laughs] Muffin top!
[Richard laughs, then stops, realizing his body is the same as his belly and chest jiggle as he laughs]
Richard: It's only funny when it's someone else's body! [Runs off crying]
Another Rampage
[During lunch in the school cafeteria, Gumball and Darwin are shown sitting at a table. Darwin is eating a sandwich, but Gumball isn't eating anything. Darwin notices that him not eating and points at his food]
Gumball: [Crossing his arms] I can't eat a thing after last night. Carrie's got a real problem! She made me eat until I passed out. I can not let that happen again.
Carrie: [Entering] Hey, Gumball, feel like helping me eat this sandwich?
Gumball: Ugh, sorry, Carrie, I'm not sure I wanna do that again.
Carrie: [Moves the sandwich away from her face] The cafeteria doesn't do refunds, Gumball.
Gumball: [Sighs] Okay, but just for this one single─
[The food rampage is abruptly shown again, with Carrie eating all the food]
A Disgusting Drink
[Gumball appears on the sidewalk again surrounded with food]
Gumball: [Groans]
Darwin: Hey, Gumball.
Gumball: It's happened again, hasn't it?
Darwin: Yep, but I think I have an idea. [Shows a cunning face]
[They are in the kitchen]
Darwin: If Carrie likes going inside your body so much, we should make your inside somewhere she won't like.
Gumball: How?
Darwin: By drinking this! [Shows his filthy fishbowl water] Dum, dum, dum, dum!
Gumball: Your rancid fishbowl water?
Darwin: And the sweaty juice of Tobias's headband, [Squeezes Tobias' sweat from his headband] a generous sprinkle of Miss Simian's dandruff, [Sprinkles dandruff on the water] fifteen-day old underpants...
Gumball: What? Where are you gonna get—
[Darwin pulls Gumball's fifteen-day unwashed underwear out from his pants]
Gumball: Oh.
Darwin: And fizzy fish gas.
[Darwin burps into his bowl with a straw]
Gumball: It's disgusting.
Darwin: It's ghost-proof.
Gumball: [Sips] Pwah! Finished?
Darwin: Come on, Gumball. You've got to drink it all.
[Gumball drinks it slowly. Darwin then forces the bowl up.]
Darwin: Nearly there, buddy!
[Gumball reacts disgustedly]
Darwin: Now close your eyes and open wide, here comes dessert!
[Gumball opens his mouth, expecting another disgusting thing. He opens his eyes and sees that it is actually Darwin eating ice cream]
Darwin: This is so good...
Gumball: [Sighs]
[At school, Gumball walks through the hallway, greeting fellow students]
Gumball: Hi, Leslie.
[His breath disgusts Leslie and makes him wither]
Gumball: How are you doing, Bobert?
[Bobert malfunctions, and Alan deflates completely]
Gumball: Hey, Sussie, how's your hot chocolate?
[Sussie vomits the hot chocolate]
Carrie: Hey, Gumball. [Smells Gumball's breath] Oh! That smell!
Gumball: I know, horrible, isn't it?
[Carrie shakes her head up and down saying yes]
Carrie: [Seductively] Mmm! I love it, smells like the undead. Makes me hungry. [Grins]
[Gumball sighs]
Jim's Locker
[The same music from the rampage starts playing in the background. Richard is sitting on the sofa, eating popcorn and watching the television. Gumball, looking much fatter than the last time, struggles to approach the sofa]
Richard: Hey, son! What's up?
Gumball: What do you [Grunts] do when someone asks you for something, [Grunts] and you don't wanna do it?
Richard: Well, people ask me to do things all the time, but do you ever see me doing anything?
Gumball: Not really.
Richard: Exactly! Son, it's time I taught you about "weaseling."
Gumball: "Weaseling"?
Richard: Allow me to demonstrate. Ask me for something.
Gumball: Okay. Can you tell me how to stop Carrie from using my body?
Richard: Well, I'd love to, but I have to go and take the meatloaf that I've been baking out of the oven.
[Gumball walks over to the window to see Richard run to the backyard and jumps over the fence]
Richard: End of lesson!
[The scene switches back at school, where Gumball tries weaseling Carrie]
Gumball: Well, I'd love to, Carrie, but unfortunately, I have to go check on my meatloaf.
Carrie: Your meatloaf?
Gumball: Yeah, I left it in my locker.
Carrie: You mean this locker? [Slams Gumball's empty locker with her elbow]
Gumball: Ugh, no, my, my gym locker. [Points to Carrie to show that he has a gym locker]
Carrie: You don't have a gym locker.
Gumball: Yes! I meant... Jim's locker.
Carrie: Who's Jim?
Gumball: He's, uh, my doctor...?
Carrie: You mean your meatloaf is in your doctor's locker, here at school?
Gumball: Yeah, it's because we're having Thanksgiving here and─ oh, whatever, you can have my body.
Just Tell Her No
[At home, Nicole is in the kitchen doing the dishes. Gumball appears in front of the kitchen window]
Gumball: Mom! I think I might be putting on weight...
Nicole: Oh, no. It's just baby fat, dear. Come on inside, we'll have a chat.
[Gumball enters the kitchen rolling like a ball]
Nicole: Oh. Perhaps you have gained a little.
Gumball: I know! It's Carrie! I don't know how to get her to stop.
Nicole: [Points to the living room] Go and sit down, honey. We need to talk.
[Gumball leaves the kitchen rolling]
[Gumball and Nicole are sitting on the sofa]
Nicole: So, have you actually tried saying "no" to Carrie?
Gumball: Huh? No? [Slaps himself] Why didn't I think of that?
Nicole: But, when you say "no," you have to mean it. Let me show you. Richard, can you come here please?
Richard: [Just woken up from his nap in the backyard] Yeah?
Nicole: Could you get me the bowl of sausages from the kitchen, dear?
Richard: Oh! [Excited and running to the kitchen to get the bowl of sausages, brings it] Can I have one?
Nicole: No. You'll have to wait. [Places the sausage on Richard's nose, he looks disappointed] Now, once you've made your position clear, you have to...
Richard: Can I have it now?
Nicole: No! [To Gumball] You have to stand firm and make sure you never...
Richard: [Desperately] What about now?
Nicole: No! That would be a bad Richard, wouldn't it? [To Gumball] What I'm trying to say is just say "no" and mean it.
Gumball: Awesome. So, can I have a sausage?
Nicole: [Gets up off the couch] No, we're putting you on a diet. [Eats a sausage and leaves]
Gumball vs. Carrie
[After the bell rings at school, Gumball and Darwin are shown walking along a corridor]
Darwin: Careful, Gumball! Carrie may be hanging around!
Gumball: Don't worry. This time, I know what I'm doing.
Carrie: Hey, Gumball, can I borrow your—
Gumball: No!
Carrie: [Shocked] "No"? What do you mean, "no"?
Gumball: I mean you can't use my body anymore!
Darwin: [Nods] Hmph!
Carrie: But, you don't know what it's like. Please, Gumball!
Gumball: No, Carrie, you can not borrow my body.
Carrie: Then, then... [Demonic voice] I'LL TAKE IT! [Enters Gumball through his mouth, possessing him]
[Darwin screams and runs away. Gumball, now possessed, leaves looking for food]
Gumball: Carrie, get out of my body!
Carrie: [Raspy voice] It's no use resisting, Gumball!
[Possessed Gumball enters the cafeteria, and everyone looks at him]
Gumball: Everyone, run! Your lunch is in danger!
Carrie: Food!
[Carrie makes him climb the wall and crawl on the ceiling. Anton, about to eat a sandwich, is disturbed by Gumball's falling spit onto his food]
Anton: Hey!
[Gumball's head rotates 180º, grabs the sandwich with his tongue and eats it. Anton screams in terror. Possessed Gumball starts eating every single piece of food he finds]
Gumball: Stop it! You're freaking our friends out!
[Carrie slaps him against the table]
Carrie: Don't care, must eat!
Gumball: OK, you asked for this!
[They fight]
Carrie: You shouldn't have done that!
Gumball: You're crazy!
[Carrie makes Gumball slap himself. He grabs his hand stopping this, and Carrie makes him kick himself]
Gumball: Cut that out or I'll tell─
[Carrie makes him grab himself by his nose and slap himself against another table. Carrie tries to eat a sausage with a fork, but Gumball stops her with another fork. They fight. Gumball, about to win the fork battle, finally fails, and Carrie throws Gumball's fork away]
Carrie: Stand down, Gumball!
Gumball:  Never! [Throws salt to his right hand]
Carrie: Ah! My eyes!
[Carrie jumps up and eats all the food in the food trays]
Carrie: [To Rocky] Give me more food!
Rocky: You ate it all. You can lick the ladle if you like.
[Possessed Gumball jumps onto Rocky]
Rocky: Ah! Get off me!
Gumball: Stop it!
[Other students look at Gumball behind the cafeteria doors, as he fights against himself]
Gumball: [Off-screen] Take that!
Carrie: What are you looking at?!
[The students scream and leave]
Gumball: [Carrie bends his arm] Ow! That doesn't bend that way. Help me, Darwin! I can't do this on my own! You're gonna have to beat this ghost down for me!
Darwin: But I'm a pacifish.
Gumball: Please, do it for me! I'm your friend! Ahh!
[Carrie forces Gumball to jump out of the window. Possessed Gumball eats all the garbage and drinks from the puddle. Gumball looks at a puddle, seeing Carrie's reflection]
Gumball: Carrie, stop doing this! You've got a serious problem.
Carrie: [Normal voice] No, I haven't.
Gumball: You're drinking dumpster water and eating garbage. Look! [Shows a bitten flip flop]
Carrie: What's that?
Gumball: It's a flip flop, Carrie. A flip flop!
Carrie: Eww, maybe I have gone a bit too far...
Gumball: Ugh, yeah.
[Carrie comes out of Gumball's body and flips her hair]
Gumball: Anyway, listen, Carrie, I was thinking─
[Darwin arrives and smacks Gumball's head with a garbage can cover]
Darwin: Spirit begone! Spirit begone! Spirit begone! Oh, hi, Carrie. Spirit be gone! Spirit be— [Realizes] Oh.
Gumball: Ow...
Carrie: I'm sorry I put you through all that. I guess I'll just go back to my painful food-less eternity.[Floats sadly away]
Gumball: No, wait! [Straightens his back as Carrie turns to face him] I think I know someone who can help.
The Perfect Body
[At home, Richard is shown sitting on the sofa with the sausage still on his nose, drooling. Gumball, Darwin, and Carrie enter the house]
Gumball: Dad, this is Carrie.
Richard: [Muffled] Hello.
Gumball: Is it OK if she borrows your body for a crazy junk food spree?
Richard: [Muffled] I guess..?
Gumball: That sounded like a "yes" to me.
[Carrie smiles, enters Richard's body, possessing him and eats the sausage from Possessed Richard's nose]
Possessed Richard: More food! [Runs to the kitchen]
Nicole: [Off-screen] No, Richard! Richard, no! No, that's a bad Richard! Stop it, Richard! Stop it!
Darwin: Another happy ending.
