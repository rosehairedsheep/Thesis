You're Being Bullied
[Gumball, Darwin, Anais, and Richard are sitting on the couch watching a thumbwrestling game on TV. Anais turns around and notices Gumball with lasagna all over his face]
Anais: Huh? Are you okay?
Gumball: Yep! School was awesome!
[Flashback shows Tina holding Gumball upside down, shaking out his spare change]
Gumball: [Voice-over] I was hanging out with Tina! She taught me how to donate to charity.
Gumball: Who is this for, again?
Tina: Me!
Gumball: [Voice-over] Then, she helped me "tear" through my homework.
[Flashback shows Tina tearing Gumball's homework, and an "F" pops up on it]
Gumball: [Voice-over] And finally, we had lunch together!
Gumball: Hmmm, what should I try first?
[Tina pushes Gumball's face into the lasagna]
Gumball: Mmmm! Lasagna!
[Flashback ends]
Gumball: It was great!
[Anais stares disapprovingly at Gumball]
Gumball: What?
Anais: I think you're being bullied.
Gumball: Nah, we're just having fun.
Anais: Hmmm... Nope, you're definitely getting bullied.
Gumball: Ah! What am I gonna do?
Anais: Don't worry, bro, I'll take care of this for you. [Pulls out a large cell phone, and calls Tina] Hey, Tina, you've been picking on my brother, and I think it's time you guys talk about this face to face!
[Tina roaring can be heard over the phone]
Anais: Tomorrow?
Tina: [Roars]
Anais: Four P.M.?!
Tina: [Roars]
Anais: Behind the school?!
Tina: [Roars]
Anais: No, wait, that's not what I meant! [Phone buzzes] Oopsies!
Gumball: Well?
Anais: It looks like your face to face turned into more of a... face to fist...
Gumball: What the... what?!
Anais: I think she wants to have a fight with you...
[Wrestling bell rings]
Richard: Come on, son, it's time I showed you how to deal with bullies.
The Bunny Hop
[Gumball and Richard are at the backyard]
Richard: There's a day in every man's life where he has to stand up for himself! But that's okay, 'cause daddy's here to teach you an old technique that got me out of trouble many times.
Gumball: [Shining eyes] Ooooh, a secret fighting technique?
Richard: Yes, it's called... The Bunny Hop! [Wrestling bell rings again] But remember, you must never use it in anger!
Gumball: I promise, father.
Richard: Alright, you be the bully.
Gumball: Okay.
Richard: Come on, don't be shy, go on and take my lunch money!
[Gumball makes a tiny step and meows, Richard freaks out]
Richard: DON'T HURT ME, DON'T HURT MY FACE, HERE'S MY LUNCH MONEY, AND MY LUNCH, PLEASE TAKE IT, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!! That was step one, and here comes the Bunny Hop!
[Richard freaks out again, jumps around, and hits the fence; Darwin and Anais came to see what happened]
Gumball: Well, that wasn't much help.
Anais: You're right, I think you need help from a real adult.
Mr. Small's Office
Mister Small​​​: School counselor, pretty scary title, huh? But don't you worry, think of me as a friend, a compadre, a fellow pilgrim, on a mad journey we call... life! So tell me, what's shaking?
Gumball: Oh, I'm fine! [Smiles]
Anais: No, he's not! He's being bullied!
Mister Small​​​: Oh, the big "B..." You know, more often than not, conversation beats confrontation. Hands down, let's meditate on this.
Gumball and Mister Small​​​: Ommmmm... Ommmmmm...
Mister Small​​​: So tell me, who's bullying you?
Gumball and Anais: Tina Rex.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: TINA REX?!
[All of Mr. Small's colors drip of his body, and he throws Gumball and Anais out of his office]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​: Don't tell her you saw me! [Closes the door's blinds]
Viva la Revolution
Anais: Well, that wasn't much help.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: No way! Gumball's gonna fight Tina?
Idaho: She's gonna mash him!
Anton: He's toast!
Banana Joe: She's gonna skin him alive!
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: This will be the greatest fight eveeer!
Gumball: [Whispering] This is getting out of hand.
Anais: Don't worry, I'll fix this. [To everybody] Come on, what is wrong with you, guys? How many of you've being bullied by Tina?
[Gumball's schoolmates mumble confused and raise their hands]
Anais: Don't you realize we could all join forces and we can stand up to Tina once and for all?
[Gumball's classmates mumble again, cheery music starts playing in the background]
Anais: And no student will ever be bullied again!
Everybody: Yeah!
Anais: And also stop global warming!
Everybody: Yeah!
Anais: And bring peace to the world!
Everybody: Yeah!
Anais: And build schools for the dolphins and the rain forests so they can cure baldness!
Everybody: Yeah!
Gumball: Uh, Anais?
Anais: [Rob carries her away] Sorry Gumball, the power's gone to my head! See you on Capitol Hill!
Banana Joe: [Speaks quickly] Good luck with the fight, man! [Laughs and runs away]
Darwin: There you are!
Gumball: [Screams] Darwin! You're supposed to be here when your best friend's about to get mangled by— [Darwin covers his mouth]
Darwin: Shhh! Just follow me!
Protecting Armor
[Gumball and Darwin are in the gym. Darwin then turns the lights on, revealing an armor made of cardboard and metal]
Darwin: Behold, the Super Bully Protecting Suit of [Echoes] Power!
Gumball: WHOAAAAH! [The arm on the suit falls off] I LOVE IT!
Darwin: [Puts the suit on Gumball, buzzes] Lookin' good. Now check this out! It's got bouncing bubble wrap pants and has an MP3 player as standard!
[Darwin turns the MP3 player on, and they starts dancing]
Darwin: And that's not all: this string here operates the Super Counter Attack Device.
[Gumball tries to use it]
Darwin: No, wait! You only got one shot, so you must wait for the right moment.
Gumball: Okay.
Darwin: And last, but not least: the tassels!
Gumball: What do these do?
Darwin: Move your arm around.
[Gumball does so]
Gumball and Darwin: Oooooh, tassels!
Darwin: Okay, time to put it to the test! Ready?
Gumball: Okay!
[Darwin repeatedly hits Gumball with a hockey stick as Gumball screams in pain]
Darwin: Can you feel anything yet? [Hits Gumball Again]
[Gumball screams in pain]
Darwin: Okay, I'll keep going!
[Gumball tries to stop Darwin, who finally stops. Gumball pulls the "Super Counter Attack Device," it's confetti]
Darwin: What did it feel like?
Gumball: [Muffled] Like I'm being hit with a stick!
Darwin: What?
[Gumball takes off the helmet of the suit, he has swolen eyes, bumps on his head and missing teeth]
Gumball: Like I'm being hit with a stick! [Throws the helmet away] That wasn't much help...
Darwin: That's okay! We could rebuild it, better, faster, stronger! Let's get to work!
[Ring bell sounds]
Darwin: Oh! Too late.
Gumball: You know what? Maybe it won't be so bad. I'll just meet Tina in quite calmed atmosphere and talk things like civilized people.
Gumball and Darwin: Yeah!
Gumball: This is a great idea!
The Confrontation
[Gumball and Darwin are at the schoolyard in the middle of a crowd that are cheering Gumball by chanting "Fight"]
Gumball: This, is a terrible idea.
[The crowd keeps chanting "Fight", until Miss Simian interrupts]
Lucy Simian: What's going on here?
[Everyone stops and looks at her]
Lucy Simian: I'll have no fighting on my watch. Oh, Gumball Watterson. I might have known!
Gumball: Ahh, thank you Miss Simian! Uhh, I was gonna fight a T-Rex. Please, send me to detention!
Lucy Simian: Well, I suppose I could... after my coffee break!
Gumball: But Miss Simian! Tina's gonna—
Lucy Simian: Emmm! Coffee. Break? [Slurps on coffee and walks away]
Gumball: But Miss Simian, you're my last hope! Please! [Cries]
[Gumball's classmates resume to chanting "Fight." Tina then stomps onto the schoolyard from behind a corner]
Masami: Uh-oh.
[Gumball gulps]
Tina: Where's Gumball?
Students: [Point at Gumball] Here!
[Everyone runs away]
Gumball: [Frightened] What am I gonna do, what am I gonna do?!
Richard: [Echoed] Use The Bunny Hop, son. Son. Son. [Back to normal] Son. Son. Son.
Gumball: Dad? What are you doing here?
Richard: Well, I wasn't gonna miss the big fight!

Gumball: Alright! Time to deal with this like a man!

Rocky: Dude, I've no idea what you're saying.
Gumball: [Cuts across Juke and Rocky] Sorry!
[Gumball uses a tray to slide through the canteen while Tina is still chasing him. Gumball screams and runs into the school swimming pool. An octopus is  swimming inside the pool as Tina chases Gumball, and it squirts colorful ink. Gumball then comes out of the pool and runs away]
Tina: [Comes out of the pool] Gumball!
[Gumball runs into the girls' room, causing the girls to scream in terror, so he quickly runs out of there]

Tina: [Roars twice]
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: TINA! NO!
Gumball: PLEASE! LET ME IN!
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​: NO!
