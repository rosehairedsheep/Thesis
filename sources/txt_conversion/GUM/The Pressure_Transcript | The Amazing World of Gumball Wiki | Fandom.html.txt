The Boyfriend Game
[Molly, Carmen, Carrie, Teri, Penny, Masami and Leslie are inside Molly's new treehouse]
Molly: So what do you think of my treehouse, girls?
[All except Masami nod and cheer]
Leslie​​​​: I love what you've done with the bathroom.
[The "bathroom" is a hole in the floor with a roll of toilet paper next to it]
Molly: [Off-screen] Thanks! I went for understated chique.
Penny: Molly has such a good eye for interior design.
[All except Masami nod and cheer]
Masami: Boring! You think because it's in a tree it's all that? Well, it isn't: it's just as boring as a real house. I mean, what is it you actually do in here, Molly?
Molly: Well, uh, I just hang out, watch the boys...
[The girls look through the window; Darwin, Tobias, and Banana Joe are cheering on Gumball to jump over a van with a skateboard, at which he slams into, setting the alarm off]
Masami: Laaame! You don't watch boys, you kiss them.
Everyone but Masami: [Surprised] What?!
Masami: Hold on! Don't tell me you don't have boyfriends. You do, Molly, right?
Molly: Uh, sure I do! You don't know him, though. He's way older and... he's in high school! [Smiles]
Everyone but Molly and Masami: Wow!
Teri: Well, my boyfriend is so old that he doesn't have a babysitter!
Everyone but Teri and Masami: Wow!
Carmen: Well, mine's so old, he stopped wearing braces!
Everyone but Carmen and Masami: Wow!
Carrie: Well, mine is so old that he doesn't even have teeth. [Flips her hair]
[Everyone looks awkwardly at Carrie]
[Penny walks near the window]
Penny: [Sighs] I wish I had a boyfriend. [Looks through the window]
[Camera changes to the boys. Gumball gets up and cracks his arms, back and neck]
Gumball: Did Penny see my stunt?
Banana Joe: Don't tell me you wanna impress those... those... those... perfumed sissies!
Gumball: You mean those girls over there? Tch, nah... [Flexes his arms] They wouldn't care about a handsome bachelor, twelve years old, who likes foreign cinema, fine dining, extreme sports and long romantic walks on the beach by moonlight.
Banana Joe: Let's make a pact, right here, right now. Pals before gals! [Extends his arm]
Darwin and Tobias​​​​: [They put their hands above Joe's] Pals before gals!
Gumball: Eeehh... [Shrugs] Okay...
[Gumball puts his hand with the other boys, then looks to the window. Penny waves, and he does the same]
Tobias​​​​: Wait, wait, wait! Let's make a blood pact! [Tries to use a stick to make a wound in his hand, but he cannot]
[Camera changes to the girls]
Molly: So, your turn to tell us, Masami. Do you have a boyfriend?
Masami: [Nervous] Yeah, he is... it's... it's... [Looks through the window] Darwin!
Everyone but Masami: Darwin?!
Masami: Yeah, he's great because... he's got legs and, you know... a head. [Fakes a smile]
Carrie: Okay.
The Hallway
[Gumball, Darwin, Banana Joe and Tobias are together; Tobias is still trying to make a wound in his hand]
Gumball: Dude, stop it already.
[Tobias stops trying to wound himself. As he does, a group of giggling can be heard]
Banana Joe: Guys, guys, guys! Enemy at twelve o'clock.
[Gumball, Darwin and Tobias look at their watches]
Banana Joe: No, this way! [Points at someone]
[The camera moves to the girls]
Masami: There he is.
Banana Joe: Remember, pals before gals.
[They nod]
Masami: Hello, sweet cheeks.
The boys: [Surprised] WHAT?!?
Carrie: Oh, c'mon. He is not your boyfriend, Masami.
Masami: Ha! He so is. Look. Hold my book, boyfriend. [Gives a book to Darwin]
Darwin: Uhhh... Okay?
Masami: I'll show you how he likes me at the treehouse.
[The girls leave while laughing]
Banana Joe: I can't believe it. You, you, you... girl-lover!
Gumball: It's always the quiet ones.
Darwin: [Throws the book on the ground] She's not my girlfriend! What am I gonna do?! WHAT AM I GONNA DO?! I know, I'll just run away and hide forever!
[Darwin jumps out of the window; he walks away with a limp]
Darwin: [Crying] I'll never forget you, guys!
Gumball: That was dramatic.
Penny: [Off-screen] Hey, Gumball.
[Gumball's face lightens up and he waves at Penny]
Gumball: Hey, Penny.
Penny: Wanna walk me to the canteen?
Gumball: [Extremely happy] Definitelyyyy... [Notices Banana Joe and Tobias looking at him] definitely not, definitely not now, but maybe... later?
[Penny looks confused at Gumball, as Banana Joe and Tobias disapprove of him. Gumball then sighs and jumps out of the window like Darwin did; walking away with a limp]
Penny: Okaaaay? [Confused, waves to him] See you later.
The Cafeteria
[Gumball is in line to get his food, cracks his arm]
Darwin: [Whispering] Gumball!
[Gumball looks under the table]
Darwin: [Whispering] I'm scared
Gumball: Darwin? I thought you ran away forever.
Darwin: I got hungry. [Gasps]
[The girls are at a table laughing]
Darwin: Oh, no! They're here.
[Gumball and Darwin peer through a column]
Darwin: What am I gonna do now?
Gumball: Don't worry buddy. [They start walking away wih their trail] If you can't see them, they can't see you.
[They splash their trails on their face and start walking. They crash with a number of columns before they stop at the girls' table]
Gumball: Ok, I think we're safe.
[They remove the trails from their face and realize where they are]
Gumball and Darwin: [They scream, but gradually stop] Hey.
Masami: Yeah, hi. I was just talking about you, boyfriend. Come and sit by me.
[Darwin whimpers]
Masami: Oh, c'mon! Don't be shy, sugar lumps, and give me a hug. [Gets close to him and tries to kiss him]
Gumball: Excuse me. Is... there room... for one more. [Gets in the middle of them] So, what are we talking about?
Masami: [Gets away from them] Ha! Well, before you so rudely interrupted us, we were talking about how Darwin is gonna kiss me in the tree house.
Darwin: [Shocked] What?!
Masami: Yeah. Because that's what boyfriend and girlfriend do. [Winks] Come on, boyfriend, let's go somewhere more private.
[Darwin's still shocked]
Masami: Boyfriend! [Leaves]
[Darwin starts leaving, but then stops and turns to Gumball]
Darwin: [Whispering] Help... me! [Leaves]
Gumball: Don't worry, buddy. I'm here for you. Pals before...
[Penny passes by and winks at Gumball]
Gumball: Hi, Penny.
Penny: Hey, Gumball.
Gumball: Where was I? Oh yeah, Darwin!
The Swimming Pool
Masami: Darwin! Darwin, where are you? Darwin? Darwin! [Leaves]
[Gumball passes by and notices some bubbles coming out the pool]
Gumball: Huh? [Looks at the pool, sees Darwin underwater] What are you doing here?
[Darwin mumbles underwater, making what he says inaudible. Then, a pair of bubbles he made pop, revealing what he said]
Darwin: She won't find me down here. She hates getting her hair wet.
Gumball: Really?
Masami: [To Rocky] Hey, have you seen Darwin around?
Gumball: [Looks at the high dive] Don't worry buddy, I'm on it.
[On the high dive, Gumball gets dizziness from the height]
Gumball: Oh, oh man. [Takes a deep breath] Pals before gals! [Jumps off]
Penny: Hey Masami, have you seen Gumball anywhere?
Gumball: Oh no, I can't do that to Penny. [Sighs] On one hand, I create a diversion to save Darwin, but on the other hand, I splash Penny and look like a— [Falls flat on the water's surface and sinks, making a loud slapping noise]
Penny: What was that?
Masami: I don't know, but it sounded painful.
Penny: Oh, well! See you at the treehouse. [Leaves]
Masami: Darwin!
[Darwin comes up inhaling, with water coming out of his mouth and nostrils]
Masami: There you are! C'mon, we're going for ice cream. [She flies off and Darwin follows]
[Gumball remerges, reddened]
Gumball: Aaaaahhh...! Oww...
[Gumball hops around moaning in pain before he grabs a pair of ice cream cones Idaho was carrying and puts them on his chest]
Idaho: Hey!
[Idaho leaves angrily. Rocky passes by and notices the ice creams on Gumball's chest]
Rocky: Hey, dude! Nice bikini!
Gumball: Thanks. Oh, Rocky, wait! [Takes the ice cream off his chest] You've had girlfriends before, right?
Rocky: Oh, yeah! Thousands of 'em!
Gumball: And how did you get rid of them?
Rocky: Well, usually, I just close my eyes and open my heart, and when I open my eyes again, they're gone...
Gumball: What do you mean?
Rocky: Well, I guess they don't want me to talk about my feelings...
Gumball: So, you mean, openly expressing your emotional turmoil, rather than coming up with a convoluted little scheme. It's so crazy it just might work.
The Hallway Again
[Gumball is in a wastebasket and gives a thumbs up to Darwin who is nervous]
Masami: Darwin!
Darwin: Listen, Masami. This is very difficult for me to say. I'm leaving. We've had good times together, but it's just not right for me. I can't help how I feel. It's not your fault, it's mine. I'm just not ready for something this amazing. You deserve someone better. Now farewell, dear heart.
[Masami glares at Darwin, and he waves at her, giving her a go on motion. Then Masami looks she's about to get angry, but starts crying]
Darwin: [Whispering] What should I do?
Gumball: [Whispering] I don't know.
Leslie​​: [Passing by] Nice work, Romeo.
Darwin: Okay, okay. I didn't mean it. Boyfriend joke. Look, I'm laughing. [Fake laughing] You can stop crying now, please.
[Masami shoots a lightning bolt]
Darwin: Please, I'll do anything you want. I'll go to the treehouse. I'll... I'll-I'll kiss you.
[Masami immediately stops]
Masami: Okay, see ya there, sweet lips.
Gumball: [Walks over, chuckling] Oh, man. I am so sorry.
Darwin: [Face turns red] What did you make me do? WHAT DID YOU MAKE ME DO?! I have to kiss a girl. I'm going to get married, I don't wanna get married. Urgh! [Walks away]
Gumball: I'm sorry, dude. Don't be like that...
Darwin: [Rushes back in] Not cool, man. NOT COOL! [Walks away again]
Gumball: Don't worry, buddy, I'll save you!
Darwin: [Calling off-screen] How?! You need to have a date to get in that treehouse!
Gumball: Yeah, that is true.
Banana Joe: [With Tobias] And what happened to "pals before gals"?
Gumball: That's cool, I'll find a way to save him.
Banana Joe: You better, cause if you don't, we will.
[Banana Joe and Tobias leave]
Penny: [Passing by] Hi, Gumball.
[Gumball follows Penny happily while giggling]
The Treehouse
[Darwin and Masami arrive at the ladder of the treehouse]
Masami: After you, boyfriend.
[Masami winks and Darwin gets scared]
Darwin: [Whispering] Somebody, please, help me.
Masami: What did you say?
Darwin: Nothing! I'm climbing, climbing.
[Darwin climbs up the treehouse and sees Gumball inside with the others]
Gumball: Hey, Darwin!
Darwin: [Gasps] Oh, no! They got you, too!
Gumball: [Sarcastically] Oh yeah, they got me. It was horrible, ohh. Oh, no, don't drag me in there and kiss me. Hehehe. Oh, well, now that we're here...
Masami: So, girls, where are all of your boyfriends?
[Awkward silence, along with whistling]
Teri: [Inhales] Okay girls, confession time. [Inhales] My boyfriend's not real.
[Everyone gasps, then the rest of the girls, and Leslie, confess as well]
Masami: So, me and Penny are the only ones with boys to kiss. Darwin?
[Darwin tries to sneak out of the treehouse]
Masami: Come on, boyfriend!
[Everyone except Gumball and Penny starts chanting "Kiss" as Masami tries to kiss Darwin, while he is backing away from her]
Darwin: Gumball, do something!
Gumball: Just a minute. [To Penny] Hehe, sorry, I have to save my best friend.
[Penny grabs Gumball's hand, making him dazed]
Penny: I'm really glad you came.
Darwin: [He's at bay] Please, you don't wanna kiss me! I taste like fish!
[Darwin gets away and Masami ends up kissing the wall]
Masami: Get back here!
Darwin: Ahhhh, Gumball!
[Darwin is running from Masami in the background and they start to fade out, while Gumball and Penny are by the window]
Penny: It's such a beautiful day, Gumball.
Gumball: Yeah, but not as beautiful as your antlers.
[As the camera sweeps past Penny, the background of the treehouse disappears as her and Gumball are now floating in the vast majority of space]
Gumball: [Sighs] Can you feel the universe moving around us?
Penny: Uh, yeah, it's more like a swaying motion, actually.
[Outside the treehouse, Banana Joe and Tobias are chopping down the tree]
Gumball: Let's kiss and remember this for all the eternity.
Masami: Let's kiss, so I can show these losers who's boss.
[The tree starts falling, Gumball is sliding to Darwin, both with their lips puckered up, and Penny and Masami are shown reacting to Gumball and Darwin kissing by mistake]
Banana Joe and Tobias​​​​​​​: Timber!
[The tree falls over on Banana Joe]
Gumball: Wow, that was amazing. Kissing Penny was like being run over by a unicorn.
Darwin: And kissing Masami wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.
Gumball: Bye, Penny.
Darwin: See ya later, sugar lumps.
Gumball: [Sighs] What fascinating creatures.
[Banana Joe pops out of the tree bush, with his head being peeled off]
Banana Joe: Pals before gals!
