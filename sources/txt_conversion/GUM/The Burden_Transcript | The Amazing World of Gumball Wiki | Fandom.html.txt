Principal Brown's Office
[The episode begins with Principal Brown holding a jar of hair removal wax and reading its instructions]
Nigel Brown: [Reading] Apply wax strip to hairy area, leave for a few seconds, then peel back quickly for a smooth and painless experience. [He puts wax all over his body and grabs a picture of Miss Simian] This is all for you my darling, and also because... [He rips some of the hair off his body, revealing muscles and bare skin] Hello?! [His hair immediately regrows] Oh well, I guess I just have to wait for the seventies to come back into fashion. Oh!
[He sees Gumball and Darwin gaping at him, disturbed by what they have just seen. Brown throws a lump of his waxed hair at the trash bin. He misses]
Nigel Brown: How long have you been standing there?
Gumball: Long enough for curiosity to turn into regret.
Nigel Brown: Right! Any plans for the weekend?
Gumball: Well, I was gonna go on a date with Penny, but maybe I'll just stay home and bleach my eyeballs.
Nigel Brown: Well, clear your diaries, gentlemen. It's your turn to look after the school hamster, Chris Morris.
[The principal brings out a hamster cage, and shows Chris Morris to Gumball and Darwin. There is a beat as they stare down the old and hairy hamster]
Gumball: Oh, come on! This hamster's so old it should be classified as a mineral. I don't wanna be the kid responsible for him when he turns into dust!
Nigel Brown: Well, I'm afraid it wasn't a request. It's an order. [Takes out Chris Morris from his cage and pets him] He's been in this cage since he was born, six long years ago. So please take extremely good- [Drops Chris Morris, then picks up a lump of his waxed fur, mistaking it for Chris Morris] -extremely good care of him.
Gumball: Principal Brown, there is no way-
Nigel Brown: Ahem! Just a moment.
[He watches the clock nearby tick down to four o'clock]
Nigel Brown: Aaaaaand-It's four o'clock. I'm not a principal anymore, I don't care.
[Miss Simian barges into the office with weird make-up on]
Lucy Simian: Romance. NOW!
[Miss Simian and Principal Brown start making weird noises and movements with their mouths and faces. This disturbs Gumball and Darwin]
Gumball: I think we've heard enough.
[Gumball and Darwin leave with Chis Morris' cage. Principal Brown leaps into Miss Simian's arms. She catches him, and they leave the office together. After they all leave, a lump of Principal Brown's hair moves, revealing itself to actually be Chris Morris. He squeaks unintelligibly, then slowly crawls away]
Chris Morris: [Squeaking, as translated by subtitles on-screen: You kept me imprisoned for an eternity. But today, at the sunset of my life, I shall walk proud and free, to a new life of happiness and abundance, and I shall see the daylight once more]
The Next Day
[The scene shows the Wattersons' house followed by a time-lapse to the next day as seen through the window of Gumball's room]
[Gumball wakes up, excited]
Gumball: My date with Penny!
[He gets up, and fixes up his hair. After trying out many hairstyles, he settles on one]
Darwin: What are you doing?
Gumball: I'm doing my hair for the date.
Darwin: Oh, cool! What should I wear?
Gumball: What do you mean?
Darwin: For the date!
Gumball: Dude, you're not coming to my date. You'd be a third wheel.
Darwin: Yeah, on your tricycle.
Gumball: No way, man.
Darwin: But I've got nothing to do!
Gumball: Well, you can look after Chris Morris.
Darwin: What? No! I've got stuff to do.
Gumball: You just said you had nothing to do! Fine, I'll look after him then. But it's your fault if this drain-hair burrito uses his last breath to ruin my date.
Gumball's Date with Penny
[Penny and Gumball are eating out in a restaurant at the Elmore Mall. "Chris Morris" (Principal Brown's lump of hair) is out of his cage on the table where Penny and Gumball are sitting]
Penny: Oh, he's so cute! I think it's so cool that you're looking after him.
Gumball: You do? Well, you see the thing you gotta learn about me, Penny, is that I'm a stand-up guy.
[Penny smiles]
Gumball: The kind of guy who takes care of school pets without being asked.
Penny: [Giggles]
Gumball: The kind of guy who welcomes responsibility.
Penny: [Giggles]
Gumball: The kind of guy you'd wanna marry.
[Penny stops giggling and has a questionable expression on her face as she does a so-so gesture]
Gumball: What? You don't believe me? Then check out these dad skills. [Strokes "Chris Morris" gently] There, there. I've got you little fella.
[Penny smiles at Gumball. She sees him as a handsome muscular cat]
Gumball: I will always be there for you.
Penny: Ooh! He's so paternal.
Gumball: Here my son, I have provided. [Eats a pizza slice, and jumps up on the table] Eat. [Attempts to regurgitate it for Chris Morris]
Penny: Dude, ugh! Okay, alright, I believe you!
[Gumball stops]
Penny: Maybe you are marriage material.
Gumball: Well, please send your resumé to my secretary.
Penny: Aw!
[Penny and Gumball both laugh, having a great time]
Try Chris Morris!
[Back at home, Darwin sits by the computer. He seems annoyed and angry]
Darwin: [Mocking Gumball] Ewuwewu-Penny! [Continues imitating Gumball and saying gibberish] Date! [Continues saying gibberish] Oh no, you can't come. [Continues saying gibberish]
[Gumball dances in, with "Chris Morris" inside his cage. Darwin attempts to ignore him]
Gumball: Oh, my gosh, dude! You have to hang out with Chris Morris, he's the best! I just had the most awesome date with Penny, and he was the perfect wingman! I'm gonna ask Principal Brown if we can take care him next weekend, and the weekend after, and the weekend after that, and the weekend--
Darwin: Dude! I'm trying to give you the silent treatment, but it doesn't work if you don't notice!
[Gumball gives Darwin "Chris Morris"]
Gumball: Just try him. [Walks away] Try Chris Morris.
Darwin's Conversation with "Chris Morris"
[Darwin and "Chris Morris" are on a bench in the park. Darwin sighs]
Darwin: Things have changed. It used to just be me and him, versus the world. But now all he cares about is [Makes an ugly face] [Mockingly] Penny. I mean, of course I want him to be happy. I just wish I could be part of it. Am I being too possessive? I am being too possessive. Do you mind if I lie down? [Lies down on bench] I think this all started a long time ago… back when I was still just a kid…
[Darwin is suddenly shown laughing hysterically]
Darwin: [Laughs crazily] I don't know why I'm so worried! It doesn't matter anyway! [Laughs crazily]
[Darwin is shown again, now paranoidly rocking on a kiddy ride]
Darwin: I just don't want to be left alone, you see? It's the silence... the terrible silence...
[Darwin is back on the bench, yelling at "Chris Morris." As he screams, he scares off some nearby park goers]
Darwin: You don't get to judge me, Chris Morris! You're not one of my dads!
[We cut to Darwin sobbing. Leslie passes by]
Leslie​​​​​​: Hi, Darwin.
Darwin: [Cheerily] Oh, hi! [Continues crying]
[Darwin is shown. He has calmed down]
Darwin: You know what, Chris Morris? I think I just realized that all this is coming from my fear of abandonment. I'm projecting my anxieties onto my brother and forgetting to actually live my own life. [Sighs contently] Dude, [Hugs "Chris Morris'" cage] thank you.
Chris Morris Is the Best!
[Darwin returns home. Gumball is on the couch]
Darwin: Chris Morris is the best!
Gumball: The best, right?!
Darwin: He's such a good listener. He really helped me through some stuff.
Gumball: Is there nothing he can't do?
["Chris Morris" does nothing. Gumball and Darwin laugh]
Darwin: I love it when he does that!
Gumball: I can't believe how much happiness he's brought us.
Darwin: And to think that all his life he's been locked up like this, starved of affection-
Gumball: Just because people couldn't see beyond the layers of oozing fur-
Darwin: The weird stickiness-
Gumball: That putrid smell-
Darwin: And the fact that he's probably contagious.
Gumball: We're sorry Chris Morris. We're gonna give you all the love you deserve!
[They both press their faces through the bars of the cage]
Gumball: We'd better take him out of the cage first.
["Chris Morris" is taken out of the cage. A montage shows "him" hanging out with a happy Gumball and Darwin. Gumball and Darwin give "Chris Morris" some ice cream, then bathe with "him." They also sleep with "him," and kiss "him" many times (getting hair inside their mouths). During the montage, subliminal flashes of pictures of hair, and Principal Brown shaving appear, interrupting the visuals and the music playing. The montage ends when Gumball and Darwin accidentally drop "Chris Morris" out of their bedroom window. They both scream]
The Truth
[The boys run down to "Chris Morris"]
Gumball: He's not moving!
Darwin: Do something!
Gumball: I'm gonna put some water on his face.
[Gumball picks "him" up and with Darwin rushes into the house. But he trips, and sends "Chris" flying. "Chris" lands on a frying pan that Richard is using to cook]
Richard: AHH! RAT! [Smashes "Chris Morris" several times with the frying pan]
Gumball: Dad, don't!
[He picks up "Chris Morris," but "he" is hot from being hit by the frying pan. Gumball throws him away, and je lands in the terrarium of the Evil Turtle. The turtle bites "Chris Morris," but Darwin rescues "him," sending him flying through the air towards Gumball]
Gumball: I've got it. I've got it!
["Chris Morris" flies into the dishwasher, and Gumball bumps into it, accidentally turning it on]
Gumball: Ahhhhh!
Darwin: You have to wait for the end of the cycle!
[The dishwasher eventually opens. "Chris Morris" is dumped out, all wet]
Gumball: Ahhhhh! We need to give him mouth-to-mouth!
Darwin: Use this macaroni!
[Gumball places the macaroni into "Chris Morris," and breathes into it. "Chris Morris" inflates, then pops]
Darwin: [Whispering] You have some Chris Morris on your face.
Gumball: I'm not really a vet, but I don't think that was Chris Morris.
Darwin: You realize what that means?
Gumball: [Sighs] The real Chris Morris has been at school all weekend- [Gasps] with no food or water!
Darwin: Yes, but it also means that what we've been kissing all day was in fact-
Gumball: Don't…
Darwin: Remember in Brown's office, and he was waxing-
Gumball: No… No… No… NOOOO!!
The Search for Chris Morris
[The boys are at the school,trying to find the real Chris Morris. Gumball tries the door, but it's locked]
Darwin: Should we call Rocky, and get him to let us in so we can find Chris Morris?
Gumball: Are you crazy, man?! We can't let people know we left an infirm rodent alone all weekend with no food or water. People hate animal cruelty. We'd get our butts kicked.
Darwin: Wouldn't that be animal cruelty?
Gumball: Yeah, it's a vicious circle. We gotta get Chris Morris back in his cage before anyone finds out.
[We cut to Chris Morris's POV, who overhears Gumball and Darwin's talk and starts squeaking angrily. It is subtitled as: "Forget you." He slowly crawls away]
Darwin: How do we get in without being seen?
Gumball: Leave this to me.
[Gumball uses his claw to cut a circle in the school window, then picks up Darwin to pick out glass, like a suction cup. This causes the wall to fall. They put the glass back where it was]
Chasing Chris Morris
[Gumball and Darwin find Chris Morris in the hallway. Chris Morris stares at them]
Gumball: There he is. I got this. [Does a dopey face] Chris Morriiis! Come here, little buddy!
[Chris Morris grabs a mop, and holds it close to the fire alarm]
Gumball: Uh, don't worry, Chris Morris, we won't hurt you. Just drop your weapon.
[Chris Morris squeaks, which is translated as "Poor choice of words."]
Gumball: Chris Morris, no!
[Chris Morris drops the mop and breaks the glass, activating the fire alarm]
Gumball: Why, you little...
[Chris Morris disappears]
Darwin: Get him!
[Gumball and Darwin run to catch Chris Morris, but run past him due to how slow he is moving]
Gumball: Wait. What?
Gumball: We're gonna have to adapt to his speed.
Darwin: How slow would that be?
Gumball: Like, '90s-Internet slow?
[Gumball and Darwin try to catch Chris Morris, but this time very slowly, moving in a manner not unlike a buffering web video]
Donut Sheriff: Must be some kind of alarm malfunction, but we'd better take a look around.
Gumball: Phew!
Lucy Simian: [Hearing Gumball exhaling] Huh? Ha!
[Miss Simian turns around. The boys are gone]
Lucy Simian: Hmm...
Gumball: He's heading for the science lab.
[Chriss Morris turns around, and gives Gumball and Darwin a "loser" gesture]
Gumball and Darwin: UGH! [Chris Morris scuttles around the corner]
Gumball: Let's head him off at the lab. You can run, but you can't hide.
[Gumball sniffs around, cat-like]
Gumball: I can smell you.
Darwin: Yeah, me too. It's kind of gassy.
[Gumball and Darwin turn around, and see a lit bunsen burner with a broken lamp next to it. Their gaze, and the camera, follows the wire under a door, and up to Chris Morris on the other side, holding it and another wire. He plugs them together]
Gumball: RUN! [The lab explodes, and the brothers flee from the blast wave] Jump!
[Gumball and Darwin flop face-first onto the floor]
Gumball: Oh, sorry. Wrong timing.
[The blast wave rushes past Gumball and Darwin. Gumball stands up, singed and furious]
Gumball: [Echoing] CHRIS MORRIS!
[Chris Morris turns around, just in time to see Gumball sprinting towards him, fast enough to leave a trail of flames. He is tackled by Gumball, and the two sail through the air]
Donut Sheriff: Uh, I think we're wasting our time here.
[Doughnut Sheriff yawns, and Gumball and Chris Morris fly through his mouth]
Donut Sheriff: Huh?
Gumball: [Impacts the ground, bouncing] Ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Aah! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! [Slides to a halt in Principal Brown's office] Gotcha.
[Chris Morris bites Gumball's hand. He screams in pain, flinging Chris Morris away.]
Donut Sheriff: What-
 Lucy Simian: -was-
 Nigel Brown: -that?
Gumball: Where is that little --
