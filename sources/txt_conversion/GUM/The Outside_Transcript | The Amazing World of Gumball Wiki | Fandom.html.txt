Visiting Frankie
[The episode starts with Gumball, Anais, Richard, and Darwin standing in front of their house's front door]
Nicole: [Deep voice] Hand it over— everything of value.
[Gumball gives Nicole his wallet, Anais gives in her watch, Darwin gives her the treasure chest that contains bubbles and Richard gives his tie]
Nicole: I said everything!
[Richard plucks off his front tooth then gives it to her]
Anais: Is this really necessary, Mom?
Nicole: I'm not taking any chances!
Richard: But he's my father! He's not gonna steal from us.
Nicole: Richard, he's a con artist. That twenty-four-karat necklace he sold you was made of actual carrots.
Richard: Yeah, but at least I remembered your birthday.
[On the car ride]
Richard: Come on, he invited us over. He's making an effort.
Nicole: He probably wants something from us.
Gumball: Or sell something to us.
Anais: Or sell one of us.
GPS: You have arrived at your destination. It is an awful neighborhood.
[The Wattersons walk toward a small house]
Anais: Does Grandpa Frankie really live in there?
Nicole: It could be worse. He could live in that. [Points over to a caravan behind them, then  knocks on the door]
Frankie: Hello, Wattersons! [His voice is coming from the caravan]
[Nicole sighs]
Frankie: Come on in! [Cockroaches come out of the caravan] Oh. Excuse the house guests.
[Nicole shudders as Richard pulls her to the caravan]
Frankie: So, let me give you a tour. Here's the living area, and that's the end of the tour.
Nicole: It's, uh...
Frankie: Well, it might not be much, but it's home for me and about twenty-five different species of parasite.
Nicole: [Quietly] Twenty-six, including you.
Richard: It's good to see you, Pop. Nice to have the family all together.
Frankie: I was gonna get in touch sooner, but my phone broke. [Holds up a tin can with string tied to it] Anyway, you guys hungry?
All excluding Frankie: Sure!
Frankie: Me, too.
Gumball: I thought there'd be some food coming after that question.
Frankie: No, just sad music. [Turns on melancholy music on the radio]
Gumball: Okay... How about a glass of water?
Frankie: Sure. [Opens the door]
Gumball: Where are you going?
Frankie: I get my water from the toilets. I'll boil it when I get back. [Walks out]
Richard: Is anyone thinking what I'm thinking?
Nicole: Yeah.
Richard: This is great!
Nicole: Let's leave now.
Both: Wait, what?!
Nicole: Richard, listen. I'm gonna try and say this as nicely as I can. This place is worse than a Porta-Potty at a punk music festival that's been left stewing in the sun for a week.
Richard: Wow! What was the harsh version like?
Nicole: I would've expanded on what the punks did inside.
Anais: Don't you get it? He lives in a confined space. He's not used to modern technology, and look—
Gumball: —Two rats roasting a cockroach over an open fire?
[The camera shows that there are two rats roasting a cockroach over a fire who then screech]
Anais: No, those; The bars on the windows. Hmm. Where did Grandpa say he was all those years when he was away?
Richard: I don't know, he just said he was somewhere no one could contact him or visit.
Anais: [Gasps] Don't you see? He was in prison! He can't do anything for himself anymore. He needs routine and people telling him what to do. We should create a familiar environment for him.
Richard: Where?
Anais: Home.
[While Anais is talking, Frankie puts his ear against the door, trying to eavesdrop on the conversation]
Anais: [Muffled voice] We need to bring Grandpa Frankie home— our home.
Frankie: Yes! [He accidentally crushes the bottle he was carrying, splashing the water over the camera and himself and grunts]
Frankie in "Prison"
[The camera shows Frankie's trip on a bus, and as soon as he arrives, he sees Anais dressed up as an accountant]
Frankie: Oh, hey, Anais! It sure is kind of you guys to invite me—
Anais: It's "Miss Watterson" to you, perp! Walk and talk with me. I haven't got all day.
Frankie: Huh. Rude.
Anais: Okay, you're going inside. Keep your nose clean, your head down, and with good behavior, you'll be out of here in time for my graduation ceremony.
[Nicole peeps out behind the curtain, then sticks in her head back]
Nicole: Right, operation Make Grandpa Frankie Feel At Home By Turning Our House Into A Prison is a go. I just wish it had a catchier title.
[Doorbell rings and Nicole opens the door with a straight face and with dressing as a prison officer]
Frankie: Oh, hey, Nicole. I hope I'm not late for dinner.
Nicole: Hand it over!
Frankie: Uh... thanks?
Nicole: And the rest.
Frankie: Oh. [Takes off his hat, trench coat, shirt, tie, pants and underwear]
Nicole: Too much.
Frankie: [Takes back his underwear] Sorry. Careful when you launder that shirt, doll. It's real silk. So, uh, where is everyone?
[Nicole throws out those things he gave]
Frankie: And what's with the face? I got a warmer reception at the igloo convention!
[Nicole stares at him furiously]
Frankie: Which is actually a thing, by the way.
[Nicole still is glazing at him furiously]
Frankie: How about you fix us a drink?
[Nicole spits out water at Frankie then throws a jail uniform]
Nicole: Put that on!
Frankie: [Sarcastically] A gift? Too kind. I think I just shed a tear. Although, my face is wet so it's hard to tell.
[Scene cuts to Gumball and Darwin's bedroom]
Nicole: You sleep here!
Frankie: Thanks, Nicole, and can I just say that— [Nicole slams the door] I guess I can't.
Gumball: Hmph.
[Gumball is on the bed covered in tattoos and Frankie greets him]
Frankie: Oh, hey, kid, looks like we're sharing. Nice tattoos; what's that one? [Points towards Gumball's arm. Penny is terribly drawn on his arm]
Gumball: [Tough voice] That's a portrait of my girl, she's waiting for me.
Frankie: Quite the looker. And that one? [Points towards Gumball, two unicorns are drawn on his chest]
Gumball: A unicorn battling another unicorn. Means I'll always defend my homies.
Frankie: And that? [Points towards Gumball's back]
Gumball: A lion with a baseball bat so people know not to mess with me.
Frankie: Kinda looks like a butt with a wig playing the oboe.
Gumball: Does it? [looks at the tattoo]
Frankie: Yeah.
Gumball: Well, it's hard to draw on your own back, okay?!
Frankie: Woah, woah, woah! Why is everyone so tense around here? And what's up with him?
[Frankie points towards Darwin. Darwin is seen in the corner taking off a doll's head and licking it, looking criminally insane]
Gumball: Yeah, I wouldn't mess with that one, he belongs in a more "padded" cell if you catch my drift.
Frankie: So do you.
Gumball: [Calm voice] Aww, you think I'm criminally insane, too. Thanks. [smiles]
Frankie: I think I'm going to bed. [Tries getting on the top bunk]
Gumball: [Back to tough voice] Hey! [Whacks Frankie with a sock making him yell] I get the top bunk, fish!
Frankie: Ugh, what is this?!
Gumball: [Normal voice] Shower gel in a sock. I couldn't find any soap.
Frankie: [Grumbles] Whatever, goodnight.
[Frankie gets on the bed and tries to sleep. Richard comes in and lays next to him]
Richard: Hey, Pop. How you holding up? They say the first night's the hardest. But don't worry, I got ya. [kisses Frankie on the cheek]
Nicole: LIGHTS OUT!
[Lights turn off; scene fades to morning]
Nicole: RISE AND SHINE, MAGGOTS!
Frankie: [gets up and hits his head on the top bunk] Ow!
Richard: Hurry up, Pop, you don't want to find out what happens if you're late. And it's your turn to empty the bucket.
Frankie: Ugh.
[Scene cuts to Frankie in the shower]
Frankie: Finally, some privacy.
[Richard shows up behind him]
Richard: Hey, Pop. We all shower together here. Can you do my back?
Frankie: Uhhh, sure.
Richard: Thanks. [kisses Frankie]
[Scene cuts to Nicole serving breakfast]
Frankie: So what's for breakfast doll? Waffles? French toast? Froot Loops? [Nicole slams mushy food on his plate] It doesn't look good but I'm sure it tastes— [eats it] nope. So not that I really mind but aren't you gonna eat with us?
Nicole: [grabs Frankie by the neck] I don't eat with you. I'm not your friend. I don't even wanna see you unless I have to! [drops Frankie]
Frankie: [walks towards the table] Hmm, I think she's warming to me. Uhh, do you mind if I sit in that chair?
Gumball: Yes!
Frankie: Huh, right.
[Richard pats on his lap and winks. Frankie sighs and sits]
Frankie: I think I've lost my appetite.
Richard: Thanks, Pop. [kisses Frankie and eats the food from his plate]
Frankie: [Sees Darwin stab back and forth with his spork around his "finger," similarly to the Knife Game] Uh, isn't that a bit risky for a kid with only one finger?
Richard: I wouldn't make eye contact with him.
Frankie: Why?
[Darwin attacks Frankie and puts a spork through his nose]
Frankie: [Screams] Ohh!
Nicole: NO SLEEPING IN THE CANTEEN! YARD, NOW!
Frankie: I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think you're becoming my favorite in this family.
Nicole: I SAID NOW!
[Cut to the yard]
Richard: [To Gumball] Mmm...feels like we're being a bit mean to him.
Gumball: What makes you say that?
Richard: Eh...I know my dad. I can sense a subtle sadness in his eyes.
[Frankie is seen crying and shooting out tears like a hose]
Gumball: Leave this to me. [Goes to Frankie]
Gumball: [Gruffly] Psst. I stole some cookies from the commissary. Want some?
Frankie: [Sniffs] For real?
Gumball: Yeah, man. Here you go. [Gives him a carton of cookies]
Frankie: [Gasps and receives the carton and eats one cookie] Thanks. See you later.
Gumball: I'm not finished yet.
Frankie: What do you mean?
Gumball: [Points to Frankie] CONTRABAND!
[Nicole runs to him and puts him in the shed]
Nicole: YOU'RE GOING IN THE HOLE!
Frankie: WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?!
[Nicole slams the door]
Frankie: [Pounding on the door] LET ME OUT! WILL SOMEONE LET ME OUT?!
[After a while]
Frankie: [Sighs]
[Nicole opens the door. Anais enters; Nicole closes the door]
Anais: Okay, Mr, uh, Watterson. I hear you have some complaints about how we run things around here. [Sits on the chair]
Frankie: [Speaks angrily] You bet I do! They hosed me down, they fed me slop, they made me shower with them and look at me like I'm the weirdo. They insulted me, they stole my clothes, they locked me in here and this time, they didn't even give me a bucket! Hold on. I need more fingers. [Grows more fingers] Even that's not enough to count all the things they did to me. Wait. Are you doodling?
Anais: Yes. It's a picture of you playing a tiny violin! [Shows a picture to him] Like it? [Crumbles the paper and throws it to Frankie's head] I'm running a correctional facility, not some kindergarten for whining man-babies!
Frankie: Wait a minute. I'm asking a four-year-old to get me out of a shed, when I could just leave. [Comes out of the shed]
[After this, he takes his clothes and goes to the house's door. Before he grabs the door handle, Nicole talks to him]
Nicole: WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?!
Frankie: Richard, your family is deranged! This place is like a prison! I'm out of here!
Nicole: Wait! Family huddle.
[Everyone except Frankie huddles together]
Nicole: [whispers] Guys, I think there's a slim possibility that maybe we are [sings] absolutely nailing it!
Gumball: Good work, everyone!
Nicole: [To Frankie] YOU'RE GOING NOWHERE, WATTERSON!
Frankie: SAYS WHO?! [Grabs the door handle, which electrocutes him]
Nicole: Too much?
Anais, Richard, Darwin, and Gumball: Nah.
The Escape
[Scene cuts to night, specifically very close to 4 a.m.; Frankie is sleeping in bed]
Frankie: Oh, my head! Well, at least it can't get any worse!
[As Frankie turns over, Gumball is shown grabbing ahold of his head. He drools on him, and Frankie groans. Scene cuts to the rest of the Wattersons standing behind the door]
Nicole: [whispers] Okay, it's four o'clock in the morning. Time for Frankie's gentle wake-up call. [shouting, as she opens the door] RISE AND SHINE, YOU MAGGOTS! [gasps] He escaped!
Richard: Hmm... Ahh! Of course, the poster! [rips poster off the wall]
Anais: The window, Dad!
Richard: Of course! The window! [Completely tears window off; dust comes off, making the Wattersons cough]
Anais: Never mind. SOUND THE ALARM!
[Nicole activates a beep on her watch]
Nicole: We're gonna need something bigger.
[Scene cuts to Frankie and Gumball hiding as a loud alarm comes off, as well as lights. Frankie runs off with Gumball]
Gumball: So where are we gonna lay low? Bolivia? Mexico? Chipotle?
Frankie: I gotta get these handcuffs off.
Gumball: Should we go to a crooked blacksmith? Bribe a lumberjack?
Frankie: No! We just go to the police!
[Frankie and Gumball confront with Doughnut Sheriff]
Frankie: So, officer, allow me to explain why I'm running through the streets in a striped jumpsuit handcuffed to a tattooed delinquent.
The Chase
Donut Sheriff: Huh...
[Frankie and Gumball run away from a police car, driven by the Doughnut Sheriff. To avoid the police officer, Frankie and Gumball stand still like a tree aside the police officer's path]
Donut Sheriff: [communicating to another police officer through a walkie-talkie] I'm in a pursuit for a fugitive handcuffed to a tattooed child!
Another police officer: You mean the tweleve-fifty-seven?
Donut Sheriff: Uh, if you say so.
[Gumball and Frankie still run, but now, the rest of the Wattersons are chasing them. Gumball and Frankie jump off-road, and Nicole stops the car]
Nicole: Stop!
[They still run]
Nicole: Release the hound.
[Richard, acting like a hound, chases them down]
Frankie: Come on! We'll lose them in here!
[Frankie and Gumball go down a sewage pipe]
Frankie: These tunnels go on fore—
Nicole: Freeze! End of the line, dirtball!
Frankie: Get back! You people are insane! Don't come any closer, or we'll jump!
Gumball: What? We haven't discussed this!
Nicole: Frankie, no! We're not insane! We're doing it for you, to make you feel like you're in prison again!
Frankie: Prison? I never went to prison!
Anais: Then, where were you when Dad was growing up?
Frankie: I was running away from prison. I got sentenced to three days in jail for selling parcels of the moon to senior citizens.
Anais: And if you weren't in prison, then how come you can't cope with living on the outside?
Frankie: I was trying to get free rent and food out of you, okay?
Nicole: Ah, he was trying to scam us! I told you!
Richard: Ah, Dad, you should've just asked. You can stay with us whenever you want. In fact, why don't you come and live with us?
[The words "live with us" echo, as Frankie recalls all the memories from prison, such as Gumball hitting him a wet sock, Darwin attacking him with a spork, him being electrocuted, and him showering with his son]
Frankie: Nah.
[He falls off the end of the sewage pipe. Meanwhile, Gumball screams, and the Wattersons gasp. Frankie's head emerges, and it is shown that the "cliff" is not far off the ground. They just land on the old disused river]
Donut Sheriff: Selling the moon to senior citizens, eh? You're going to prison!
Frankie: No rent, free food. Why not?
