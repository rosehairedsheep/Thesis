The Living Room
[Gumball is lying on the couch reading a comic book. Richard approaches with a sly smile and clears his throat]
Gumball: [Annoyed] What?
Richard: Remember your last birthday present?
Gumball: [Sarcastically] How can I forget? My present was an IOU.
Richard: Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna need that back.
Gumball: [Sighs and sits up] Really?
[Gumball holds out the IOU, which Richard takes and rips in half]
Richard: Because... [Pulls out a handheld gaming console from behind his back]
Gumball: [Screams excitedly and takes the console] You got me a Game... [Looks at the front of the console, which is labeled GameChild™] ...Child? [Turns the console over] Made in Chainor? This is such a knock-off even the country it was made in is a knock-off! [Sighs] Did you buy it from the back of that van?
Richard: Yeah, the Awesome Store. What's the problem? Everything we have is a knock-off. Our TV? It's a Soppy. Only two letters different, but that never stopped you from watching it. Your superhero, Badman, he's a knock-off too. But you love his morally dubious adventures. Even our doctor only has a doctorate in fine arts, [Lifts up his shirt to reveal stitches in the shape of a fruit plate] but he did a great job on my appendix scar.
Gumball: Okay, thungs.
Richard: What?
Gumball: That's knock-off for thanks.
Richard: [Turns to leave] That's the spirit. [Walks out of the room]
[The console turns on as it makes a "ping!" sound]
Gumball: "Inverted Paradox: The Enemy Within?" [Sighs] JRPG titles never make sense; they're just random words thrown together. The fashion equivalent would be wearing a Hawaiian shirt, ski boots and a top hat. Actually that does explain how the characters normally look.
[Gumball struggles to operate the console]
Gumball: Dad, your console's not working! [Reads] "Go to bathroom, attic, bedroom"?
[Gumball presses the 'bedroom' button, and the entire scene starts to fade to black as he screams repeatedly, then he teleports to his bedroom]
The Bedroom
Gumball: Dude, what is going on?!
Darwin: There you are! Sorry, I forgot your name.
[The screen shows a name selector]
Gumball: Please enter name? [Gasps] I've trapped us inside a video game! [Singsong voice] Awesome!
[Gumball types in a name]
Darwin: Please, MYBUTT, tell me what is going on.
[Gumball snickers as Darwin and Anais talk to each other]
[Anais walks in]
Anais: A foul curse has been released upon our town by MYBUTT.
Darwin: You mean the gates of doom were opened by MYBUTT?
Anais: The fabric of the universe was ripped apart by MYBUTT.
Darwin: MYBUTT has made quite a mess.
[Gumball begins laughing hysterically]
Gumball: Surely this is gonna get old at some point.
Darwin: Here's some healing ointment to help MYBUTT in the heat of battle!
Gumball: [Laughs and wipes a tear away] Nope.
Voice: "Anais and Darwin have joined your team".
[Ping! The screen shows that Gumball has received the bottle of healing ointment]
Outside
Darwin: Oh no, the path is blocked by an awkwardly placed shrub! And we're apparently too stupid to walk on the lawn.
[Gumball selects an axe from the console]
Voice: "MYBUTT uses AXE. It is ineffective".
[Gumball selects a saw]
Voice: "MYBUTT uses SAW. It is ineffective".
Gumball: Can MYBUTT just use common sense and walk around it?!
Voice: "MYBUTT uses SARCASM. It is ineffective".
Gumball: Argh! [Kicks the shrub]
[Screen spins and reveals a hideous flower monster. It sends leaves toward Gumball]
Gumball: Pfft, I'm pretty sure I can handle a few le— [The leaves slash his face] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ah! Ach! [Falls to the ground]
Voice: MYBUTT receives CRITICAL damage.
[Gumball snickers]
Anais: A leaf monster would be susceptible to fire attacks.
Gumball: Yes, I think most things are susceptible to fire attacks. [Selects "Science" attack on the console]
[Anais rises with powers; dramatically pours chemical from test tube to test tube and then throws it at the flower monster, defeating it]
All: Woah! Yeah! Awesome!
Darwin: We did it!
[The Watterson kids pose in victory]
[Gumball, Darwin and Anais walk towards the path and seemingly out of nowhere, Leslie appears behind them]
Darwin: Leslie? What happened to you?
Leslie: I bought some fertilizer from THE AWESOME STORE. I went home after visiting THE AWESOME STORE and used the fertilizer I'd just bought at THE AWESOME STORE...
Leslie: [In the background] But who will stand up to such a dangerous enemy as...
Gumball: Okay! Okay! We got it, we got it. The awesome store is the villain.
Leslie: THE AWESOME STORE...
Darwin: MAKE IT STOP!
Leslie: [In the background] The problem is no-one knows how to find...
Gumball: I can't! There's no command to skip through his cutscene.
Leslie: THE AWESOME STORE...
Darwin: DO SOMETHING!
Gumball: Hold on!
[Gumball takes Darwin's dialogue box from the bottom of the screen]
Leslie: THE AWESO—
[Gumball proceeds to hit Leslie with the box. Leslie left unconscious and the letters in his new dialouge are now mixed up]
Anais: We could've just walked away. But now maybe we should run.
[The Watterson kids run. The scene fades to black and switches to the porch of the Robinson household]
Anais: What are we doing at Mr. Robinson's?
Gumball [Searching through items] Getting loot.
Anais: I think you mean looting.
Gumball No, if there are items hidden in these pots, they must be for me.
Anais: No, I'm pretty sure the mailman hid them there so people like you wouldn't steal them.
[The Wattersons kids enter the house]
Gumball: No, that's how it works in RPGs. Whatever you find, you take.
Darwin: I don't know. There was no *BUDABLING* sound when you took that VHS player. Right now it just feels like you're ransacking an old man's house.
Gumball: I'm sure Mr. Robinson doesn't mind.
Gaylord: Welcome to my home. Please take whatever you need for your quest.
Gumball: Hm. [Takes Mr. Robinson's money] I'm gonna go sleep in his bed now.
[A single tear slides down Mr. Robinson's smiling face. The scene transitions to the street, with Anais wearing a soldier outfit with a giant, robotic sword]
Anais: What's with this new outfit? Can someone explain why this gigantic sword has a trigger?
Gumball: Yeah, well you did reject the alternative outfit.
Anais: Yeah I don't think that was age appropriate.
[Gumball changes her outfit back to normal]
Gumball: But those leather platform boots would have given you plus five vision!
Anais: How?
Gumball: Well, they make you taller, don't they?
Anais: [Gasps] Oh, that actually makes sense.
[Gumball walks into Penny, equipped with a mechanical eye, who turns around and roars. Scene cuts to a battle scene]
Gumball: Oh, man. I can't fight my girlfriend!
Darwin: You have to!
[Penny roars and is about to attack them]
Gumball: Uh, okay, I'll try to calm her down. Oh, how 'bout a gift?
[Gumball selects "Item." He summons the VHS player with a heart animation and throws it at her]
Gumball: I love you!
[VHS player hits Penny in the head, leaving her face disfigured; the battle ends. Gumball, Darwin, and Anais do the victory dance with horrified faces]
Penny: [Slurring] Thanks for saving me. The cellphone I bought from THE AWESOME STORE took possession of me. [Removes the smartphone from her face] Here, take it. It will help you in battle.
Voice: "Smartphone acquired. You may now summon friends in battle".
Gumball: Thanks Penny. Sorry about the whole disfiguring you with the VHS player thing. [Kisses Penny on the cheek]
Penny: [Slurring] No problem. Just a scratch.
[The Watterson kids walk away, but as they do, Penny and her dialogue box fall to the ground. The scene fades and cuts back to the trio]
Darwin: Wait, I think this person has a clue for us!
Gumball: Really? I wonder what makes you say that.
[It is shown that Alison is feeding her pigeons. Gumball commences his interaction with her by pushing a button on the console]
Alison: Hello. I've lost my pigeons. Will you help me find them?
[The screen shows a map indicating all the spots the pigeons are at]
Gumball: No! A super tedious side quest that preys on every gamer's weakness!
Anais: Tortilla chips and sugary drinks?
Gumball: No!
Darwin: The sun?
Gumball: No, the compulsive need to complete every game 100 percent.
[Screen reads, "400 packs of tortilla chips, 300 cans of energy drinks LATER." Gumball, shown as an overweight nerd, enters back to Alison, letting her take the pigeons]
Voice: "You've earned the NO LIFE trophy".
Gumball: Worth it.
Preparing for the Awesome Store
[Scene cuts to the world map]
Gumball: Okay, we need to find this AWESOME STORE before we all start growing anime hair.
[Anais grows an anime hairstyle resembling Rizelea's]
Anais: But where is it?
[Gumball grows an anime hairstyle resembling Cloud Strife's]
Gumball: There must be a clue somewhere.
[Darwin grows an anime hairstyle resembling Sephiroth's]
Darwin: How about that?
[Camera moves to show a building with a gold skull and a thundercloud above it]
Gumball: Yeah, that'll be it.
Anais: Wait, we can't go yet! We don't have enough XPs to fight the boss.
Gumball: Then, we'll do the things that make up most RPGs— GRIND!
Anais: What's that?
Gumball: Fighting menial enemies until we're stacked!
[Scene transitions to a battle montage involving fighting squirrels, birds, rats, butterflies, squirrels again, birds again, and a bunny, squirrel, and bird; a battle theme plays. They no longer have anime hair]
Anais: Hmmm. We still need more XPs. But there are no enemies left to fight.
[They look around, and proceed to attack several residents of Elmore]
Billy: No, no, no— Aah!
[Victorious music plays]
Darwin: We're finally strong enough to take on THE AWESOME STORE! Let's go!
Gumball: Wait, don't you kinda want to hear that awesome battle music one last time?
[Battle theme plays]
Gumball, Darwin, and Anais: Do-ba-do-ba-do, do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-ba-do-ba-do, ba-na-na-na.
[Scene cuts to Gumball, Darwin, and Anais about to go through the entrance of the building; menacing music plays]
Gumball: You guys ready? 'Cause there's no turning back.
Darwin and Anais: Mm-hmm.
[All go through]
Gumball: [He tries to go back, but there's a force that pushes him] No, no, wait. I forgot to save! I forgot to save!
Darwin: It's too late! The cut scene already started!
Gumball: No, no, no— NOOOOOOOO!
[Thunder crashes. Pipes drip, while the scene cuts to the trio walking through with worry]
Van shopkeeper: Welcome.
[They gasp. Scene cuts to a man, showing only his eyes, opening the Awesome Store]
Van shopkeeper: Welcome to the end of your quest. Prepare to fight your true enemy.
[Gumball, Darwin, and Anais scream terrified and abruptly attack the Awesome Store with magic powers]
Van shopkeeper: JEEZ LOUISE! I was about to explain how we're allies, not enemies.
Gumball: Oh, uh, sorry. It's just you looked so evil, and you sold people all those cursed objects and stuff.
Van shopkeeper: What do they expect when they buy things from the back of a van?
Gumball: Fair point. Anyway, what were you saying?
Van shopkeeper: The secret is not a game. The secret to beat the game is to beat the game.
Gumball: Uhhhhhhh, what?
Van shopkeeper: The console is the enemy.
Gumball: Ohh! "Inverted Paradox: The Enemy Within." So the name actually meant something. Makes sense, because we're playing the game in real life and the enemy is— AAH!
The Console
[Gumball screams; the Game Child console turns into a "boss" creature and the scene cuts to a battle. It roars]
Anais: How do we fight? We don't have the console anymore.
Gumball: We take it on, hand to hand. Hi-yah!
[He performs a karate chop, but it doesn't reach the console creature]
Anais: Aren't you supposed to actually hit it?
Gumball: I'm not touching that with my bare hands. I don't know where its tentacles have been.
[The console attacks them, causing them to have 1 HP (health point) left]
Anais: Wait, what happens in this game if we perish?
Gumball: I guess we perish in the real world, too. Or worse, we'll have to restart the whole game from the beginning.
[The console roars and shoots lasers that force the three to dodge them]
Darwin: Use the potion I gave you!
Gumball: But we might need it later!
Darwin: Dude, we literally only have one XP left!
Gumball: Aw, fine. Yah!
[Gumball throws the potion; however, it gives the console 650 more health points]
Darwin: I meant, use it on us!
Anais: Gumball, we still have the phone!
Gumball: Of course! [Prepares to throw the phone]
Anais: No, we can use it to summon friends in battle!
Gumball: Oh, yeah, right.
[Gumball dramatically dials his friends and family. Sarah is summoned, and she uses BRAIN FREEZE: she pulls off her head and throws it at the monster, freezing it and taking out 999 health points. Hector is summoned and uses PSYCHE!: he is about to punch it, but instead flicks it, taking out 999 health. Banana Joe is summoned; he uses THOUSAND BLOWS: he dons a run pose, and continuously moves his arms and legs up and down, emanating multiple lasers, each taking 100 health. Carrie is summoned, and she uses STOP HITTING YOURSELF: she possesses the console and hits itself numerous times, each hit taking 100 health. Granny Jojo is summoned; she uses GIVE US A KISS: she pulls out her dentures and throws them at the console creature, and the dentures bite the monster, taking out 999 health. Nicole is summoned; she uses I'M NOT ANGRY JUST DISAPPOINTED: she stares at it with a very stern look, surprisingly taking out 999 health. The camera zooms out, showing a giant Richard in the background. Scene cuts to space, where Richard uses RING OF FIRE: he eats power and farts out a ray of light at it. Gumball presses the phone, and the console screeches as it dies. The battle ends; Gumball, Darwin, and Anais do a victory dance. The game cuts to the credits, displaying the text: INVERTED PARADOX THE ENEMY WITHIN, CREDITS: Directed by." Scene abruptly cuts to Gumball, Darwin and Anais back in reality, on the couch]
Back to Reality
Gumball: Ah, no one cares about the credits. "Congratulations, you completed the game at eighty-nine percent."
Darwin and Anais: Yay!
Gumball: What do you mean, eighty-nine percent? "Do you want to start a new game?"
Darwin and Anais: [Gasps] NOOOOO—
[Gumball selects "YES," and the episode abruptly ends]
