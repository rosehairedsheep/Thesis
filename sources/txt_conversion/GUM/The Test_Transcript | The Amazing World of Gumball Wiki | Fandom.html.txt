The Test Result
[The episode starts in the library, with Gumball turning to face the viewer]
Gumball: The Internet– the power of infinite knowledge, only a click away. A tool to transform the world and unite every being. And this is what they do with it! [Points to computer screen] Twenty-six pictures of llamas that pretty much sum up the human condition?
Sarah: But look at that one having a bad hair day! [Laughs]
Gumball: Sarah, it's just a llama-based ploy to ram as much advertising into your face as possible.
Sarah: But it's good advertising. Look: "Doctors hate him. Learn his five-step trick for rock-hard abs!"
Gumball: Sarah, that's a picture of a rock. [Sighs] The more we look at these things, the more our brains deterio-gen-aria-rate.
Sarah: So you're saying you don't want to know what type of sitcom character you are?
Gumball: No.
Sarah: But it says it will blow your mind.
Gumball: I wasn't convinced, but now they've added that tag line, I'm kind of intrigued. "Pick an object." What? How is that supposed to help analyze what kind of person I am? "Pick a word." Noodloo, Ferengoy, Classoflerp, or Maurice? These aren't even words.
Darwin: Yes, they are.
Gumball: Use them in a sentence.
Darwin: I'm just going to the classoflerp to pick up my new ferengoy with Maurice. Noodloo!
Sarah: Which of these is your favorite: a sock, the wind, Uganda, or a pickle?
Gumball: I'm pretty sure these tests are created by pouring seeds on a keyboard and having pigeons peck at it.
[Gumball makes his choice and his results come up]
Gumball: What the what?! I'm the loser?!
Sarah: Of course, you're the character the audience likes to laugh at, the loser. Usually likes to criticize everyone, but stays completely oblivious to their own failings.
Gumball: That sounds like I'm some sort of pathetic punk! Wha-what did you guys get?
Sarah: I got anime-obsessed fangirl who stalks the loser. [Whispers] Which is completely accurate.
Darwin: I got lovable sidekick, usually the loser's best friend.
Sarah: Another important part to play in the grand sitcom that is life!
Gumball: This is ridiculous! My life is not a sitcom and that test is completely random! Look, I'll prove it.
[Gumball mashes the keyboard with his butt; the result is the same]
Gumball: [Gasps] Loser again?!
Darwin: Being the loser is cool, dude. You're kinda like the antihero.
Gumball: Uh, no, it's not cool, it's not at all who I wanna be.
Darwin: So who did you wanna be?
Gumball: Well, uh, I'm not sure.
Sarah: [Clears throat] Describe him to me.
Gumball: Athletic, the strong silent type, but who's also really funny and has great hair.
Darwin: Are you sure this is who you wanna be? He kinda looks like a muscly mime with a horse mane.
[Sarah shows her drawing of a mime with long hair]
Gumball: No no, dude, it's just— [Sighs] I just wanna be popular.
Darwin: What are you gonna do, then?
Gumball: The exact reverse of everything I'd normally do!
No More "Gumballisms"
[A sequence shows Gumball doing everything in reverse. He starts by waking up and walking backwards out of his room while undressing. He waits at a bus stop, completely naked, which troubles his classmates. During class, he uses his feet to put glasses on his butt and pretends to read a book. Later, he throws his bat at Leslie while they play baseball. Darwin finally stops him when he spits out his chewed food and starts putting it back in the container in front of Rocky]
Darwin: Alright, you're taking this too literally. I gotta put an end to it before you go to the bathroom.
Gumball: You're right. I got a better idea on how to become the popular one.
Darwin: It's not gonna be anything weird or unhealthy, is it?
Gumball: No no no. I'm just gonna bottle up all my natural urges. [Holds his breath]
Darwin: What are you doing?
Gumball: Bottling up my urge to breathe.
Darwin: [Sighs] I can see this is gonna pan out great.
[Gumball gives a thumbs up and faints. Cuts to Darwin carrying Gumball out of a classroom]
Darwin: How about you just stick to being nice and stay away from the usual Gumballisms?
Gumball: What's a Gumballism?
Darwin: When you say unnecessarily mean things like "Your face looks like a cat trying to claw its way out of a melon."
Gumball: Ugh, okay.
[Gumball gets off Darwin and walks off. He pauses when Tobias walks by Gumball and Darwin]
Tobias​​: Hey, dudes!
[Tobias walks by Gumball and Darwin, showing off his very unflattering new haircut]
Tobias​​: Notice anything different?
Gumball: [Holding back] Y-yeah, you look like a— [Gumball's insides are shown as he contains himself] You look like a cannelloni filled with idiocy! You look like the sausage on top of your head hasn't finished loading! You look like a SNORK!
[Something tries to crawl out of Gumball's mouth. He swallows it]
Gumball: [Tries to smile and has a cracked voice] You look like a new man.
Tobias​​: Ha ha, thanks.
[Tobias walks away, while Sarah awkwardly looks at him and makes a weirded out face and faces at the camera, pointing at him]
[Gumball spits out a green creature]
Venom: Your hair looks like a bread saaauce- [Melts]
Darwin: What was that?
Gumball: The venom I'm keeping inside.
The Sitcom
[The school bell rings]
[Gumball tries to hold his breath to prevent any venom from coming out while Banana Joe and Leslie talk to him]
Banana Joe: I must say, you're way nicer to talk to today.
Leslie​​​​​​​​​: Yeah. Usually, you're a total picknitter.
Gumball: D-did you just say "picknitter?" [Gags]
Leslie​​​​​​​​​: Uh-huh. But now you've turned over a new leap, and started a nude.
Gumball: Th-thank you for noticing.
Lucy Simian: Okay class, settle down please.
[Banana Joe walks to the back of the classroom with the bottom of his body peeking out of his peel. A creature makes its way out of Gumball's mouth; he pushes it back in. Gumball starts to breathe as if he's about to choke]
Darwin: Are you sure you can maintain this?
Gumball: It's a lot of venom to digest, but I think my body's getting used to it.
Darwin: Well, be careful you don't get an ulcer.
[Gumball pulls his sweater up to reveal venoms trying to come out of his abdomen]
Gumball: Yeah, I'm way past that point.
[Camera pans to Tobias]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: Most people get indigestion, but I guess you get [Finger-guns] outdigestion!
[The format changes to 90's VHS quality and a laugh track plays, causing Darwin and Sarah to look around]
Darwin: Where did that come from?
Sarah: I don't know. What's going on?
[Cuts to a guitar cue with a nineties version of an intro of school and cuts to the schoolyard. An audience cheers for Tobias as he walks up to Masami and Carrie. Darwin and Sarah can be seen sitting on a bench in the background, studying Tobias]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: Hey, Masami, I've been thinking. We should go out.
Masami: But we're already outside.
[The audience laughs. Sarah takes notes]
Sarah: Hm, continuity mistake with the haircut.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: No, I mean we should go out on a date!
Masami: Sure, meet you at a quarter past never.
[Masami and Carrie move away while a guitar noise cue plays. Tobias makes a face that looks as if he's about to cry at the camera, and the audience "awwws" at Tobias. Cuts back to Sarah and Darwin]
Sarah: Oh, no.
Darwin: What?
Sarah: The canned laughter, the bad jokes? Nature hates a vacuum, and I think Tobias has replaced Gumball as the loser in the grand sitcom of our lives.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: [Clare walks by Tobias and pauses when he's about to talk to her] Hey, Clare. I've been thinking, we should go out. And I don't mean outside. [Audience laughs]
Clare: Normally, I wouldn't date such a loser, but I'm impressed by your confidence. See you tonight!
[Clare walks away, and Tobias makes a happy face at the camera. Cut to Sarah and Darwin again]
Darwin: Yeah, I'm more concerned about Gumball.
[Gumball is sitting next to Sussie on the bench, who can be seen drinking. Gumball appears to be struggling to hold back venom. Juke walks by and waves to Gumball. Gumball gives a thumbs up and smiles, and one of his teeth falls off. Cut back to Sarah and Darwin]
Darwin: He's more popular now, but I'm worried his liver is gonna fail from all the bile he's keeping inside.
[Cut to Tobias, and Masami approaches him]
Masami: Sorry I was so rude earlier, it was very courageous of you to ask me out. So, see you tonight?
[Masami winks and moves away. Tobias makes a confused face at the camera, and the audience makes an "oh" sound and laughs. Cut to Sarah and Darwin]
Sarah: A two-timer date story?! [Throws her pencil off-screen] That's the laziest [Throws her notebook against the floor] sitcom setup of all time! That multicolored buttclown steals the spot for two minutes, and we're already swimming in lazy sitcom clichés!
[Sarah drags Darwin away]
New Lead
[A sitcom stinger plays. Camera shows a locker hallway before cutting to Alan, staring at papers on the bulletin board. Tobias walks to Alan.]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: Hey, Alan! Do you remember that time when I was trying to date Carmen?
[Tobias flashes back to the events of "The Move" the time when Carmen angrily slapped her book against Tobias for flirting at her and storms off]
Alan​​​​: Hm, no, I wasn't there. Also, for the record, Carmen is my girlf—
Tobias​​​​: Or that time when I was trying to date Masami?
[Tobias remembers another event in "The Move" when Masami angrily hit him with her book after he tried flirting with her]
Tobias​​​​​​​: [Laughs] Ah, good times... Or that time I was trying to date Carrie?
[Alan interrupts Tobias]
Alan​​​​​​​: Can you please stop doing this? I don't share these memories, I'm just looking at you looking up!
[The audience laughs. Camera pans to Darwin and Sarah]
Sarah: He's already turned our lives into some lazy clip show!
[Camera pans back to Tobias and Alan]
Tobias​​​​​​​: My dry spell is over. Tonight, I'm dating not one, but two girls!
Alan​​​​​​​: Yeah. Putting aside the fact that it's morally disgusting, how are you gonna be in two places at the same time?
Tobias​​​​​​​: Easy, I'll just ask my genius sister for help. Anais!
[The audience cheers as Anais (with glasses) walks towards Tobias. Alan looks confused]
Anais: [Lisping] What's going on? Why have I got a lisp?
Darwin and Sarah: What?!
Sarah: Not only is he doing a terrible job as the loser, he's taking over Gumball's whole life and ruining that too!
Darwin: What do we do?!
Sarah: [Pulling out a baseball bat, speaking in sinister voice] We take him out.
Darwin: No! How about we convince Gumball to go back to normal?
Sarah: Yeah, of course. We'll try that first.
[Sarah holds up her baseball bat and speaks in the sinister voice again]
Sarah: And then... [Darwin moves her bat down]
Darwin: Come on.
[Sarah and Darwin start walking away]
Tobias​​​​​​​: [Off-screen] Hurry up, Anais, or we'll be late for the Battle of the Bands!
Sarah: [Charges, swinging her bat. Darwin tries to go after Sarah] Now he's changing his story halfway through!
Darwin: Chill out!
Sarah: No! He's ruining the continuity! MY CONTINUITY!
[Darwin holds her back, eventually dragging her off-screen]
The Amazing World of Tobias?!
[Cut to the school library. Gumball can be seen sitting behind Felix, who is munching chips. Gumball's stomach growls. Darwin and Sarah approach him from behind]
Darwin: Hey, dude! You need to be the loser agai—
[Gumball turns around. His skin has more desaturated colors and visible veins is eyes are twitching and have tiny pupils, and a green liquid runs out of his nose]
Darwin: What the—
Sarah: Gumball, you need to get back to your old loser self!
Gumball: [Stops making the weird face] No way, man. I'm popular now. [Chews]
Darwin: Dude. What are you chewing?
Gumball: I dunno if it's a piece of meat that was stuck to my teeth, or a bit of my tongue.
Darwin: You're poisoning yourself!
Gumball: It doesn't matter! I'm like that Roman emperor guy who kept drinking a bit of poison everyday to build up a resistance.
Darwin: Oh, and how did that end?
Gumball: Uh, his palace was invaded and he tried to off himself drinking poison, but it didn't work and he got hacked to pieces by his own soldiers.
Darwin: Okay, that's— It would've been better if he had poisoned himself. But either way, you can see it didn't end well, right?
Gumball: Nothing will change my mind.
[Darwin makes a sound]
Sarah: What was that?
Darwin: An ironic music cue.
Sarah: Nah, it'd be more like...
[Darwin and Sarah proceed to imitate sitcom cues]
Sarah: Eh, scary one works too.
[Camera cuts to a school intro scene and cuts to the Wattersons' house at nighttime. Darwin comes home, followed by Sarah, dragging Gumball]
Gumball: Wait, why is it suddenly nighttime? School's not even over!
Sarah: Trust me, that's not the most illogical thing going on right now.
[Darwin screams as he begins to glitch out and disappears]
Gumball: W-wait-what's going on?!
Sarah: That. [Points to the left]
[Darwin appears at the table, where Tobias and the rest of the Watterson family are having dinner. Richard and Nicole stare awkwardly at Tobias]
Tobias​​: Mom, have you been buying food at the gross-ery store again?
[Anais and Darwin look at Nicole and Richard in confusion, who shake their heads at each other, just as confused]
Tobias​​: 'Cause this mashed potato should be called trashed potato!
[Tobias smiles and winks at the camera as the audience laughs. Cut to Sarah and Gumball, behind the couch]
Sarah: The worse the joke, the louder the laughter!
Gumball: What's he doing here?
[Camera edits the background to have Christmas decorations]
Sarah: He's doing a Christmas special now, apparently.
[The house is suddenly decorated with Christmas lights, and the family is in the living room opening presents. Gumball and Sarah are now watching from outside]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: You know what, sis? I guess we learned a big lesson today. Christmas is not about presents, it's about family. So let's welcome a new member to our family: say hello to Gworp!
Gworp: Yeeh! Gworp!
Gumball: What is that thing?
Sarah: The lovable alien who's only there to boost ratings!
Gumball: It makes no sense, we're not even in the living room anymore!
Sarah: We're not even on the ground.
[Gumball and Sarah fall down, and the camera edits the scene so that they land in the park]
Gumball: What the— Okay, Sarah, what the what's going on here?
Sarah: You need to be the loser again!
Gumball: No! People love the new me.
Sarah: Not everyone. [Points to Tobias and Penny, walking together]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: So, Penny, I was thinking we should have a dinner date at that new diner, Dinner.
Penny: That's easy for you to say. [She and Tobias laugh]
Gumball: No.... No, not Penny! Tobias, you— [Stomach growls and makes ulcers]
Sarah: That's it! Spit your venom at him!
Gumball: You're—
[Gumball tries to make insults, but can't and develops tears. His stomach makes more ulcers]
Sarah: If it goes on much longer, the sitcom of our lives will be so awful it'll get cancelled!
Gumball: You— [His stomach makes ulcers form back in his body]
Sarah: Or worse, it'll turn out that it was all a dream! [The word "dream" echoes] Oh, gosh darn it!
[Camera fades to a different scene as if it was a "dream"]
Tobias Jumps the Shark
[Tobias wakes up in the hospital with Gumball, Darwin, Sarah and Joan beside him. Sarah and Gumball make mad faces while Gumball is storing his venom]
Tobias​​: Wait, what? What happened?
Joan: You had a boating accident while trying to jump a shark on waterskis. You've been unconscious for a few days.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​: Oh, you guys! Thanks for being there for me. I guess friendship is the one boat that will never sink.
[The audience "awwws" while a cue plays. Sarah immediately grabs the guitar that was playing it, and throws it at the screen, reverting the screen to a clear, modern day one, and the audience makes a shocked sound. Meanwhile, Gumball is still struggling to keep his remarks to himself]
Sarah: Do it.
[Gumball holds Tobias' face and violently throws up heavy amounts of venom at him, burning a hole into it. Gumball now has a normal face instead of one that struggles to hold venom]
Sarah: I would say, "In your face!", [Looks at the camera] if you had one!
[A faceless Tobias and his blanket falls off his bed as his friends laugh. Joan walks to the bed with a plate of food and a cup of water. She sees Tobias on the floor, throws the plate to raise her arms and screams in terror, ending the episode]
