And, here it is, the new-- [Stops as he reaches in the box and feels something] Wha...What the? What is that?!? [Turns off his camera, then turns it back on a little while later] So, yeah, after a little research, I discovered what happened to my package. Looks like it was dispatched to the wrong address.

ButterSmear
[Scene changes to Richard recording himself in his children's room]
Richard: I love butter. But "science" claims that the body is not designed to consume only butter. Well, man has been known to overcome every obstacle in his existence. We've been on the moon, and proved the Earth is flat, and Albert Einstein brought a guy named Frank back from the grave! So I'll tell you what, real science is not taking no for an answer. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...[Holds up a stick of butter on a popsicle stick] ButterSmear! It's the combined taste of all the essential food groups: Burgers, bacon, sausages, fries, bacon, burritos, curries, bacon, bacon, bacon--all in one healthy yet delicious yellow spread. I've eaten ButterSmear every meal for eleven days now and I feel no ill side effects at all. In fact, I've lost feeling in my entire body. Pledge today to help me push mankind one step further. [Eats the ButterSmear] Mmm...ButterSmear, makes everything taste a little bit butter. [Falls face-first onto keyboard. Richard speaks in a muffled voice] If you're watching this video, please call an ambulance.
