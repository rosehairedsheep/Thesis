[The episode starts at the Elmore Junior High School, with the students crowded around Tobias in the hallway]
Tina: Am I invited?
Leslie: Am I invited?
Gumball: Am I invited?
Darwin: Am I invited?
Tobias​​​​​​​: Guys, guys! Let me cut to the chase here, alright? You're all invited!
Students: Yay! A high school party, and we are all invited!
Rachel​​​​​​​: NONE OF YOU ARE INVIIIIIITEEEED!!!
Tobias​​​​​​: [Indifferently] Oh, hi Rachel.
Rachel​​​​​​​: My party is for young adults! Not old BABIIIIES!
Tobias​​​​​​​: [Tuts and wags his finger] Rachel, Rachel, Rachel. Wouldn't it be a shame if Mom and Dad found out about your secret party?
Students: [Simultaneously tut and wag their fingers] Rachel, Rachel, Rachel.
Rachel​​​​​​​: [Pretends to think for a second] Fine. You can come.
[Some students quietly cheer]
Rachel: But you all have to bring... a date!
Students: A date?!
Rachel​​​​​​​: Uh-huh.
[Rachel walks off then pops back in]
Rachel​​​​​​​: Good luck! [Leaves again]
[The students look at the camera, all in horror, apart from Darwin who is confused. Then, everyone but Darwin runs off screaming. Darwin eyes the rest, then looks back bewildered]
Darwin: What's a date? [Walks in the direction of where the rest ran off, and calls them] Hey! What's a date?
[Miss Simian appears behind a closed classroom door]
Lucy Simian: Hmm... A secret house party, eh? Mhh, I'd better tell Principal Brown. [Lowers]
Date Options
[At the cafeteria, Gumball and Darwin are sitting at a table, with Gumball looking around the room marking a list of dates he could bring at the party]
Gumball: All right, buddy, let's make a list of possible dates.
Darwin: What's a date?
Bobert: [Rises] Date, D-A-T-E, social activity undertaken by two people to assess their suitability for a relationship. [Lowers, then rises again and tells another meaning of "date"] It is also a fruit that makes you poop. [Lowers back again]
Gumball: Yeeeah... thanks?
Darwin: Hey! What about Penny?
Gumball: Aw, Penny?
[Gumball looks at Penny while she's holding her trail laughing. He sees her through a crush filter]
Gumball: [Off-screen] Oh, no, no, no. I just like her as a friend.
[Gumball's pupils are shaped like hearts and his tongue is hanging out]
Darwin: Why are your eyes shaped like hearts?
Gumball: Allergies!
Darwin: Oh. Well, what about Carrie?
[Carrie is shown eating a sandwich]
Gumball: [Off-screen] Carrie... She's got spirit...
[A piece of sandwich falls off Carrie's body onto the floor, Carrie is shocked]
Gumball: [Off-screen] I'll put her in the "maybes". Next.
[Teri is shown laughing]
Gumball: [Off-screen] Teri. Nicely drawn features...
[Teri turns her face to the right, making herself nearly invisible]
Gumball: [Off-screen] But a little flat.
Gumball: I'll put her in the "possiblies". Hmmm...
[Carmen is shown reading a science book]
Gumball: [Off-screen] Carmen. Prickly, but smart. Interesting.
Gumball: Umm, Sussie...
[Sussie is shown chewing with her mouth open while Masami and Penny look at her nonchalantly]
Gumball: No. [Marks the list and looks down sadly]
[A paper plane suddenly appears and lands on the green food]
Darwin: What's that?
Gumball: [Opens the paper plane and reads the question written on it] "Would you be the jelly in my peanut butter sandwich?" Mmm...
[Gumball imagines two slices of bread with peanut butter but without jelly]
Imaginary Bread: What do you say, Gumball?
Gumball: Nah. No, thanks. I already ate. [Crumples and throws away the paper plane] All right buddy, it's date-time!
A Very Bad Flirter
[The scene transitions to the school hallway with a rainbow-heart animation. Gumball walks up to Masami while she's talking to Teri]
Gumball​: Hey Masami, wanna be my date? You're not really my type 'cuz I usually like attractive girls, but hey, beggars can't be choosers.
[Masami gets angry and turns stormy]
Gumball: You are a girl, right?
[Masami is still angry]
Gumball: What?
[Masami strikes Gumball with lightning and flies away. Gumball screams and coughs]
Gumball: How about you, Teri? You look desperate.
[Teri gasps, insulted, and swings her hand in front of Gumball, touching his face lightly]
Gumball: Was that a slap?
Teri: [Angrily] Yes. [Walks away]
Gumball: Uh, ouch?
[Sussie walks by]
Gumball: Ahhh! Hey, Sussie, it's your lucky day, you're my date for the party. What do you say?
[Sussie burps in Gumball's face and he gasps for air, she then walks away]
[Banana Joe and Carmen pass by while holding hands]
Banana Joe: Haha! Date fail! Come on, Prickles, let's roll! [Runs off with Carmen]
[Gumball sighs]
One Last Option
[The scene changes to the Wattersons' house, with the family having lunch at the table]
Richard: Oh cheer up, Gumball. When I was your age, I needed a girl for a party and what I said to her was: [Stuffs a lump of food into his mouth, then mumbles before swallowing the food] and twenty years later, we're still married.
Gumball: Aww, Dad, you make it sound so easy...
Anais: Are you sure you've asked every girl in class?
Darwin: You didn't ask Penny.
Gumball: Penny?! She's too hot. NOT-not hot, n— hot... my type, not my type! Hehehe... [Smiles nervously]
[Shot cuts to a ketchup doodle of Penny on Gumball's plate]
Anais: Well, if it's not Penny, there's still one girl you haven't asked.
Gumball: Really? Who?
[Anais stares at him]
Gumball: Oh. Her.
[Anais gives Gumball the phone and he talks on it outside of the kitchen]
Gumball: Hi, this is Gumball Watterson calling. Would you be my date to the party? Uh no, you weren't exactly the first girl I asked but... No-no-no-no-no-no, don't hang up! [Whispers] Please, I can beg.
[Gumball kneels down]
Gumball: [Whispers] Yes, I'm on my knees. Hey, I'm not saying that! No-no-no-no, please don't hang up! [Sighs] Fine. I, Gumball Watterson, have a stupid face... [Darwin peeks] stuck on a big stupid head... [Anais peeks] with a tiny stupid brain... [Nicole peeks] and stupid is my favorite color. [Richard peeks]
[Darwin, Anais, Nicole, and Richard laugh softly]
Gumball: [Gasps] You will?! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you so much! I'll pick you up at eight. [Hangs up the phone and looks behind him]
[Darwin, Anais, Nicole, and Richard run back into their seats, while Darwin falls for a split second then flips back up to his seat]
Gumball: Yesss! See Darwin? No girl can resist me.
Gumball's Date
[The scene cuts to Richard driving the kids to the party]
Richard: [Crying] I'm so proud of you. My baby boy is becoming a man.
Gumball : Yeah! Keep it together, dad.
Richard: It seems like only yesterday we were watching "Daisy The Donkey" together.
Gumball: Dad, that was yesterday.
Richard: Well, it feels like a long time ago. And look at you now, dating a girl!
[Camera zooms out, revealing Tina on the back seat, sticking out her tongue]
Outside Tobias'
[Gumball rings the doorbell, waiting with Darwin and Tina, then Hector appears and lowers his hand to drop Penny]
Penny: Hey.
Darwin: Hello.
Gumball: Hi, Penny!
Penny: [Indifferently] Yeah, hi, Gumball.
Gumball: So... I didn't realize you were coming with Hector.
Penny: I didn't realize you liked lizard-breath.
[Tina smells her breath, there's a long awkward silence]
Darwin: I feel awkward.
[Principal Brown and Miss Simian pop out of a nearby bush]
Nigel Brown: Ahh... More guests have arrived. Shall we make our move?
Lucy Simian: Patience, Nigel. Let's wait until it's in full swing.
[They both hide back into the bush]
[Rachel opens the door feeling excited, then becomes disappointed]
Rachel​​​​​​​​​​​: TOBIAS! More of your dweeb loser baby friends have arrived.
[Rachel walks back in the house and Tobias slides in]
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​: GUYS! GUYS! This party is totally off the hook!
Tobias' Party
[Gumball and Darwin are in the house looking at the party in disbelief]
[Bobert, Anton and Banana Joe are dancing while clapping their hands, while Teri and Leslie are playing Tea Party]

Leslie​​​​​​​​​​: Don't mind if I do.
[Molly and Rob are playing catch using Alan as the ball]
Alan​​​​​​​​​​: Whoohoo! This is such fun!

[Some of the students are putting their hands up]
Lucy Simian: Busted WIDE OPEN!
Nigel Brown: [Appears behind her] Busted.
Lucy Simian: Now for some real music!
[Miss Simian presses one of Juke's buttons, and dance music begins playing with the scene changing to a neon party. Everyone starts screaming, violently smashing things and raising horn sings with their hands]
[Rob and Tobias have lamp shades on their heads, switching them on and off, revealing their brains like an X-ray, Alan attempts to fit himself in with some other balloons, Leslie is dancing with his pot on his head, and Sussie is still eating chips]
Jamie: Hey, look! I'm gonna throw the TV out of the window!
TV: Please, allow me. [Jumps out of the window]

[The crowd throws Miss Simian into the air, and she then falls onto the floor]
Nigel Brown: That's my girl! WOOHOO! [Headbutts Bobert]
[Molly and Carmen are jumping on the sofa. Molly jumps so high she pops out of the roof]
The Sun: [Angrily] Hey, dude. I'm trying to sleep here!
Molly: Sorry.
[Rachel is seen sitting on the stairs outside crying]
Darwin: Hello. [Walks out toward Rachel] Hey, why are you crying?
Rachel​​​​​​​​: [Sadly] Because this is the worst party ever! I invited everybody and none of my friends turned out! [Continues sobbing]
Darwin: But we all came, and we're your friends!
Rachel​​​​​​​​: You guys aren't my friends. YOU JUST TRASHED MY PARENTS' HOUSE!
[Banana Joe flies out the window, he then laughs and runs back inside]
Darwin: Don't worry, I'll tidy it up!
Rachel​​​​​​​​: Yeah, sure, you're gonna tidy all this up?
Darwin: Of course! Don't you know I'm part sucker fish? [Moves his mouth up and down, making "whoop" sound effects]
Rachel​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Thanks. [Sniffs] What's your name?
Darwin: Darwin Raglan Caspian Ahab Poseidon Nicodemus Watterson III!
Rachel​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​: [Giggles] You don't seem so bad, for a kid.
Party Down

Teri is asleep on the floor with scribbles all over her, Juke is sleeping in a corner with his tape on the floor and its reel extending from the outside of his reader, Sussie is still eating, and Idaho and Banana Joe are dancing slowly with parts of their skin peeled off]
Idaho: Haha! I'm doing the mashed potato!
[Leslie is lying on the ground facing down, then raises his head, revealing his wrinkled face]

[Penny and Hector are dancing together. Gumball and Tina are also dancing unenthusiastically]
Penny: Hey, how's your date?
Gumball: [Sarcastically] Great. How's yours?
Penny: Hector's not really my type... Gumball? Do you remember that paper plane?
Gumball: Umm, oh yeah! "Will you be the jelly in my peanut butter sandwich?" I wasn't really hungry.
Penny: No, silly! I was the peanut butter.
Gumball: What?! Oh, I was supposed to be the jelly, wasn't I?
Penny: You seriously didn't understand?
Gumball: Uh, no.
Hector: Hey, Tina! Can I have the next dance?
Tina: You can have this one. [Drops Gumball]
Gumball: Aahh!
After the Party
[Darwin sucks the messes like a vacuum cleaner, sucks the damaged sofa and spits it out, turning it as if it was new. He then meets with Rachel, Gumball and Penny outside the house]
Darwin: Finished!
Rachel​​​​​​: Darwin! You're the best kid ever! How come you don't have a girlfriend?
Darwin: What do I need a girlfriend for?
Rachel​​​​​​​​​​​​​: This. [Kisses Darwin's cheek]
Darwin: [Whispering] Everything's so clear now. [Flips upside down with a huge smile on his face]
Rachel​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Is he gonna be alright?
Gumball: Yeah, yeah, he'll be fine. Uh, Penny?
Penny: Yes?
[Suddenly, the world fades away as Gumball and Penny are surrounded by the vastness of space once again]
Gumball: Um, I was thinking about the, you know, next party? Maybe you can be the sandwich in my uh, peanut jelly butter... you know what I mean.
Penny: [Giggles] Yeah, I'd love to.
[Penny and Gumball lean in for a kiss... only to be interrupted by Richard, who honks the horn repeatedly, abruptly cutting the scene back to reality]

Gumball: Oh, well. Time to go... [Sadly] I guess. [Perks up again] C'mon buddy!
[Gumball drags Darwin to the car]
Gumball: Thanks for the party! I love you, Penny! [Facepalms] What did I say that for?!
Rachel​​​​​​​​​​​​​: Is that really the best we can do?
Penny: I think he's awesome. [Blushes]
Back in the Car
[Darwin, Gumball, and Richard are all sitting silently in the car]
Richard: [Whispering] I like the new one better.
Gumball: [Blushes] Who? What? Penny? Oh no, I don't love her! I-I mean love her! I mean like her. Can we go home, please?
Richard: And how was the party for you, Darwin?
Darwin: I don't know exactly how to put it into words, but... [Starts yodeling]
Epilogue
[At Tobias' house, Mr. and Mrs. Wilson are talking, with only their shadows being visible]
