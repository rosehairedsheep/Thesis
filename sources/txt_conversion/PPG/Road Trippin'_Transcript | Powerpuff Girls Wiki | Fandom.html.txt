Bubbles: (writing in her diary, as she is talking, an animation of what she is drawing is shown) Dear Diary, my week's been going alright. I went to a petting zoo, I passed my spelling test...oh, and the Professor hates me! (She crosses out a picture she has drawn of the Professor being angry at her) Okay...well, not like he hates me hates me, it's just, sometimes I think we don't have much in common; not like my sisters.
She looks to the hallway, where she sees Blossom and Buttercup on the Professor's shoulders, and they are laughing and playing together).

Professor Utonium: That's my little lab partner!
Bubbles: But with me... She finishes colouring a drawing. Professor! I finally figured out Ciro Sciro shaving! Nice hatching, huh? She holds her hand up, and an arrow points to it; she expects him to give her a high five.
Professor Utonium: Very, um...nice. That's my Bubbles. He walks away.
Bubbles is left there with her drawing, looking disappointed still holding the hand up that she expected him to give her a high five on.
