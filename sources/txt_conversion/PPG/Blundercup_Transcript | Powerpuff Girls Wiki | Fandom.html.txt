[Theme Song]
[The episode starts at the Powerpuff Girls' house]
Buttercup: [Punches pig alarm clock] Yeah! [Skates on the railing down the stairs] Yeah! [Opens the fridge] Lunch! Yeah! [Looks in brown paper bag] Broccoli! No! [Throws it on the ground which explodes] Yeah! [Punches a monster] Yeah! [Arrives in class at school]
Teacher: You're late.
Buttercup: [Punches clock] Yeah! [Walks out the school and kicks a ball out of the playground] Yeah! Buttercup rocks! Buttercup rocks! [Pauses the video she made of the whole day] So, what do you think? Pretty fierce superhero cut, right?
Bubbles: My review: I think it was aggressive, yet inspiring.
Blossom: And I think that was the school's last kickball. [Takes out a milk jug] We're down to playing with an old plastic jug. [While she was talking, Buttercup is addicted to her phone after the video she made waiting for a follower] You've been neglecting your chores, you've promised to make dinner all week, and you haven't done it once. [Throws milk jug at her head] Buttercup!
Buttercup: All right. My video got me another follower.
[An unnamed boy made out of butter follows Buttercup on her video]
[We go on to the next day where Buttercup thinks she is having an off day. She tries to punch the pig alarm clock again multiple times, but fails]
Buttercup: What the...? Come on. [She keeps doing it lightly and it finally stops] There we go. Um... Yeah!
[She tries to skate on the railing going down the stairs and she falls on the ground]
Buttercup: Yeah. [Tries to open the fridge, but it hits her] Lunch! Yeah! [An egg carton falls on her head] [We go back to the school where she and Blossom are walking] Man, something is up with me today.
Blossom: Relax. You're fine.
Buttercup: [Slips on water and falls on the ground] See? It's like I've lost my mojo.
Blossom: What? He's right over there.
[Camera zooms to Mojo Jojo on the slide with impatient children and a child crying]
Mojo Jojo: Mojo will go down at his own pace.
[We go back to Blossom and Buttercup]
Buttercup: You know what I mean. I just feel off.
Bubbles: [Flies to her sisters] Hey, guys. Want to go to Penguin Pete's? I've got scoupons! It's 2-for-1 Scoop Day!
Blossom: Oh. I'm sure that will make you feel better.
Buttercup: Nah. I'm not feeling so hot. I'm just gonna head home.
Blossom: OK. Call us if you change your mind. [Buttercup sighs]
[A milk jug is shown falling out of the sky]
Barry: Incoming.
[It hits Buttercup who falls on the grass caused by it and lands on her head which turns brown]
Barry: Sorry, Buttercup. It's just that we're down to playing kickball with a milk jug.
Buttercup: Ah! [Takes milk jug off her head] which is flattened] My head! [She looks at Barry like he's being weird] What?
Barry: Nothing. [Walks away scared]
[On her way home, Buttercup is sweating butter from her flattened head]
Buttercup: Buttercup rocks. Buttercup rocks. [Starts getting tired] Buttercup rocks. [Tries to fly, but just lands on the sidewalk and walks] Buttercup...Buttercup. Whew. Rocks. [Tries to fly again and lands on the sidewalk by walking home instead] Buttercup. Rocks. Whew. [Arrives home and opens the door] Ugh! That took forever. [She flies upstairs leaving a trail of butter on the stairs] I am sweating like crazy. [In the bathroom, she looks in the mirror and sees that she is now butter] Ah! I'm melting!
Blossom: [Knocks on door] Buttercup.
Buttercup: Uh. Someone's in here.
[We see Blossom and Bubbles are outside of the closed door]
Bubbles: I think she's pooping.
Blossom: How did you beat us home from Penguin Pete's?
Buttercup: What are you talking about?
Blossom: Remember. You changed your mind and came to get ice cream.
Bubbles: Yeah. You benchpressed a table and chugged 2 root beer floats.
Blossom: You were just starting the 3rd one while we left.
Buttercup: That is stuff I do. But that's impossible.
Blossom: [Off-screen] Come on, Buttercup.
Buttercup: No. I...I'm gonna be awhile. [Flies to the window] I've gotta get to Penguin Pete's and figure out what's going on. [Falls out the window due to already being butter]
Blossom: [Off-screen] Buttercup. 
[Buttercup made it to Penguin Pete's and looks in the window to see someone who looks like her, but is not her, who is now chugging a root beer float]
[We hear that the people in the ice cream store are cheering for this person while Buttercup is watching this]
Buttercup: What the...? [She slips down before falling on the sidewalk and stands up while this person went outside]
Buttercup Double: [Walks out from Penguin Pete's while talking to someone in Buttercup's voice] Yeah. See you tomorrow. [Licks ice cream cone and until seeing Buttercup just now, talks more like a boy than Buttercup sounded like since she is a girl] Well, look who showed up. Not that will do you any good. [Licks ice cream]
Real Buttercup: Who are you? And why do you look like me?
Buttercup Double: Because I am you now. And you are me, Butterfingers.
Real Buttercup: I'll show you Butterfingers! [Tries to punch the double, but fails and falls on the sidewalk] Huh?
Buttercup Double: Wow. You really showed me, Butterfingers!
Real Buttercup: Ah! What did you do to me?
Buttercup Double: I took your powers.
Real Buttercup: But how?
Buttercup Double: I'm glad you asked. [Flashback begins] You see, I always wanted to be a superhero. It looked so cool. Fighting robots and monsters. Everybody loved superheroes. But I was just a regular kid. Until one day, I got a job at the County Science Fair of Food working the fried butter piece. There was an accident with the nuclear fusion deep fryer. My DNA must've fused with the butter. I finally got superpowers! It turns out they weren't all that super. All I could do was melt. Dogs chased me, people cowered at me, then chased me, I couldn't even drive.
Real Buttercup: Hey. Are you even old enough to drive?
Buttercup Double: Shh. My story. The point is everything was bad. But the worst of all, I couldn't even fight robots and monsters. I was the lamest superhero ever. That's when I saw your videos online.
Buttercup on video: I'm Buttercup and I'm a superhero. I fight robots, I fight monsters. It's great to be me.
Buttercup Double: So, I decided to take your advice and use my butter fusion powers for the one thing they were good for: Becoming you. Now that I'm a real superhero, I am never going back.
Real Buttercup: You can't just steal my body. I won't let you!
Buttercup Double: Oh, really? [Zaps her with heat vision causing her to melt since she's butter]
Real Buttercup: Ah! I'm melting! [Screams as she then goes down the drain]
Buttercup Double: Butter luck next time! [Laughs] Time to be a superhero. Aw, man, I'm gonna punch so many robots. [The double is punching robots and monsters]
Rock Singer: Buttercup rocks! [This whole day just happened as the double's video ends] [It turns out that it was a video the double showed to Blossom and Bubbles who were just watching it] What'd you think? Pretty sweet, right? I fought a monster and a robot. Aw, man, being a superhero is awesome! 
Blossom: Yes, we know. We saw that because we were there. Anyway, you have chores and homework to finish.
Bubbles: Yeah. You were supposed to make dinner all week and you haven't. NOW MAKE DINNER!
Buttercup Double: Geez. Fine. I'll make dinner.
Bubbles: Should we order a pizza just in case?
Blossom: No. Let's give Buttercup a chance.
[In the kitchen, the double is making dinner chopping something with a big knife]
Buttercup Double: [Gets angry that the real Buttercup's sisters are telling what to do while chopping the piece of food] Dinner. Pssh. Superheroes don't make dinner or do chores. I wanna fight monsters and robots. They can't tell me what to do. I've waited my whole life to be a superhero. They're not gonna ruin this for me. No. I won't let them! [He smells something] I smell butter. [The real Buttercup shows up behind him]
Real Buttercup: Hello, Butterfingers.
Buttercup Double: You. But how? I melted you down the drain.
Real Buttercup: You did. But all drains lead to the ocean, Butterfingers.
Buttercup Double: Yeah. Exactly.
Real Buttercup: So I went in the opposite direction.
Buttercup Double: Well, then. I guess I'll just have to send you right back down the drain. [A fight starts when the double tries to use heat vision again on her, but she dodges it] Whoa. Slick move.
Real Buttercup: You haven't seen anything yet.
[The double and the real Buttercup lunge at each other and the double punches her, the real Buttercup hits the double with a frying pan, and the double uses a blender on her. While they fight, Blossom and Bubbles are waiting for dinner]
Blossom: Mm. Looks like Buttercup is making something good in there.
Bubbles: [Reaches her hand out] So...hungry.
[The fight continues as the double throws utensils at the real Buttercup as she dodges them]
Buttercup Double: What? Did you get new superpowers?
Real Buttercup: No. I just figured out how to use yours. [Throws 3 frying pans and the double dodges them]
Buttercup Double: [Groans] How are you beating me? I can fly. [The real Buttercup punches the double onto a kitchen cabinet]
Real Buttercup: SO can airplanes, but I can beat them up. When it comes to superpowers, it doesn't matter what they are. It's about what you do with them. [The double punches her multiple times, but she doesn't feel any pain]
Blossom: We should make Buttercup do the dishes too.
Bubbles: Ooh.
[The double is still punching her and is very tired from doing it] 
Real Buttercup: What's the matter? Getting tired? I'm just buttering you up. [Flies down] You had all that potential. [Goes on the floor to make the double fall on the ground from slipping] But you slipped up.
Buttercup Double: You're right. I'm sorry. Now I realize I've got to embrace my powers and be myself. [Sighs] I'll give you your powers back.
Real Buttercup: Whoa, really?
Buttercup Double: No. I love being you. And I'm not gonna give that up now. [Blasts her with laser vision in which she's on the ground and flies back with a mop] Time to mop you up. For good. [Tries to get her with the mop, but she dodges again] Wait. Where'd she go? [The real Buttercup is behind him]
Real Buttercup: Right here, Butterfingers.
Buttercup Double: Huh?
[The real Buttercup does the same thing that her double did when he took her body and takes her body back]
Buttercup: [Breathes] [Sighs] I...I did it. I'm back. Life was hard as a stick of butter. Being melty all the time. And then I realized. It's not my powers that make me a superhero. It's me. Buttercup. I'm great. So I embraced my new body. And I fought hard. But now I'm back, sisters. And I'm gonna make everything right from here on out. Thanks for holding on to the hope I will one day return.
Blossom: Buttercup, is this another excuse to not make dinner?
Buttercup: What?! Wait. Did you not even notice that I was gone?
Blossom: Come on, Bubbles. Let's order that pizza.
[The hunger deprived Bubbles groans and falls onto the floor]
