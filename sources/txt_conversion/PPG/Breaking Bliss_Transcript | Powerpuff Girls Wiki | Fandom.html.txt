(Opening scene: In the Old Western. Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, who groan in pain, get ground hit on their backs as they look up in fear.)
Tyrannosaurus Tex: (Old Western laugh and accent) Nice try, partners, but this here is my pokie. (smashes a rock behind him with his tail)
Blossom: Back off, Tritosaurus Tex, this town isn't big enough for all of us! Trust me, I do know this.  
Tyrannosaurus Tex: So, listen, shoda, in there, well, brum!(aiming at the 3 Girls with his tail as they all gasp)
Bliss: (Goes in front of the 3 Girls guarding them stopping Tex's tail with telekinesis) Hey, Tex, time for you to (throws him telekinetically) go extinct! (Makes herself disappear and appear randomly punching him, finishing him off with one more punch onto the ground.) And that's how the West was won. (simulation ends)
Computer Female Voice: Simulation complete.
(Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup cheer Bliss on her victory zipping over to her.)
Buttercup: (Softly) Sweet! Wow, your catchphrases have come a long way.
Blossom: Now that your superpowers are under control, I'd say I think we say the Powerpuff Girls when I say you're...
Professor: (Voice, being shown) Not ready. (in a simulation chamber elevator which goes down)
Bliss: (Bit nervous and scared) But, Professor, I aced every simulation.
Professor: Yes, but your powers are still untested. Just because you've had some good luck on the simulator... (Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup protest trying to support their sister, but he stops them.) Girls, I have made my decision. It's for your own good, Bliss. (walking away) You'll just have to trust me.
Bliss: But Professor... (sighs in sadness and stops as she hears the Powerpuff Hotline)
Blossom: The emergency signal. Come on, girls, let's go! (stops, seeing Bliss depressed)
Bliss: It's alright, girls. I'll just be in my room, (floating away) going nowhere.
Buttercup: Why is it her room all of a sudden? (All 3 Girls zip away)
