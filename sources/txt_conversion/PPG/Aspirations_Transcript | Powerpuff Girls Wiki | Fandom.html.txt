(Cut to Ace with the girls floating above him.)
Ace: She's all yours, girls. (He flips up a quarter) Come on, guys. Let's hit some video games at the mini-mart. 
(Ace leaves o.c. and the rest of the gang follows him. Cut to Sedusa on her butt in the mud.)
Sedusa: (whining) Aah!  
(Cut to the girls with the artifacts looking o.c. victoriously.)
Sedusa: (from o.c.) I will return! 
(The girls fly up o.c. Cut to Sedusa whining in the mud again. Zoom in on her as she whines.)
Sedusa: I'll have my vengeance. YOU'LL SEE! I will return again! (slightly imitating the Terminator) I'll be back!
Narrator: Oh, no, you won't, sister! 
(The background behind Sedusa dissolves into the inside of a jail cell. Medal bars slide in front of her.)
Narrator: Because you're in jail! Ha, ha!
(Zoom out to show that Sedusa is in a jail cell.)
Bubbles: (from o.c.) All's well that ends well. 
(Pan down to show all three girls with the mayor.)
Buttercup: Sedusa's in jail.
Blossom: And all the artifacts are back in place.
(Cut to a close-up of the mayor.)
Mayor: (holds up the scepter) And I got my candy cane back!  
Narrator: (as Mayor licks the scepter) Yes indeed! And so, once again, the day is saved,
(The background for the end shot comes up and the girls appear in their usual pose.)
Narrator: thanks to the Powerpuff Girls!
(The girls zoom out to the top left of the screen and the Gangreen Gang appears.)
Narrator: And the Gangreen Gang. 
The End!  
Weâ€™ll see you again soon!
