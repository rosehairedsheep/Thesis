[Open Int. Beach House]
(Pearl is seen warping onto the temple Warp Pad, and she flinches when Steven calls out to her.)
Steven: Pearl! Where have you been? *runs to Pearl*
Pearl: Uh, looking for Peridot! ... For a few days straight... Steven, I know I might have... disappointed... all of you. I know Garnet is very upset with me, but I'm going to prove to her that she can trust me again!
(Garnet then walks in through the front door.)
Pearl: Oh! Garnet! I was just looking for Peridot! She's bound to be somewhere, right? Any new ideas? (Garnet says nothing, and walks past her.) I'm sorry... *looks down*
(Garnet stops walking, and Greg's voice is heard from outside, as he bursts in through the front door.)
Greg: Who wants to go on a road trip?! (Everyone glares at him, all looking unhappy.) Umm... Is this a bad time?
Garnet: No. Please continue. *approaches Greg*
Greg: Well I gotta drive over to the next state, Keystone.
Pearl: You mean the Keystone state?
Greg: Right, the state named Keystone. I met a guy on an internet message board who's selling car wash brushes for real cheap! I just gotta meet him in Keystone and pick em' up!
Steven: I don't like those brushes, they feel weird on your fur.
Greg: Well, do you like motels?
Steven: Probably!
Greg: Think you'd like to stay at a motel with your favorite dad?
Steven: I don't know if you're my favorite...
Greg: What? Huh... oh, you kidder! Come here!
Steven: *jumps into Greg's arms* I can't wait to get room service!
Greg: You're thinking of a hotel, we're going to a motel. It'll have a pool, and free ice, and it's right next to The Best Diner in the World!
Garnet: I'm coming too.
Pearl: What?
Steven: *gasps* Even better!
Greg: *whispers* Hey, Garnet, I know I'm talking this place up, but... it ain't exactly the Ritz.
Garnet: *smiling* I'll be the judge of that.
Greg: Well in that case... road trip!
Steven: ROAD TRIP!
Garnet: *nods head* Road trip.
Pearl: Wonderful! I'll make sure Amethyst knows that... (Garnet walks past Pearl out the door.) Fine! *strains a smile* Well... goodbye!
Steven: This is going to be fun! Right, Dad?
(Greg looks at Steven, visibly worried.)
[Trans. Int. Greg's Van, Sunset]
(Greg drives Steven and Garnet out of Beach City in his van through the night. Steven is fast asleep, Greg is tired, and Garnet is wide awake, seemingly unrest.)
[Trans. Int. Keystone Motel, Night-time]
(Greg arrives at the motel and parks his van outside.)
Greg: Another great thing about motels: *opens the room door* You can drive right up to your door!
(Steven gasps in awe as they look at an ordinary motel room.)
Steven: I'm gonna swim in the pool, order a movie, get free ice! It's gonna be great! *jumps on a bed*
Greg: Not before we check for bed bugs, it isn't! *rushes over*
(Garnet enters the room, carrying their luggage and groaning.)
Greg: Good news! We're bugless! (Greg's cellphone then lights up.) Oh! That's my cue. Hey, do you mind holding down the fort until I get back?
(Garnet sits on the other bed, hands on her knees twitching, and gives a thumbs-up.)
Greg: Great. I'm going to see a man about a tunnel brush... An internet man... If I'm not back in an hour, call the police.
Steven: Okay! (Greg leaves the room.) Bounce with me Garnet! *jumps on the bed* O-or we could look at brochures. Oh, Keystone Caverns....
Garnet (Sapphire)
*groaning* Calm down.
Garnet (Ruby)
*panting* I don't feel like forgiving Pearl!
Garnet (Sapphire)
*shaking* You don't understand, we must.
Garnet (Ruby)
*grabs her shoulders* If you're not going to listen then you can just... go!
(Garnet then splits apart, separating into Ruby and Sapphire, who scream as they fall to the floor.)
Sapphire: *facing away from Ruby* We must move past this, Ruby.
Ruby: She lied to us so we'd form Sardonyx! She tricked us; don't you feel used?!
Steven: *stars in his eyes* Ruby! Sapphire! I uh-
Sapphire: You're choosing to take it personally.
Ruby: *jumping to her feet* It's FUSION, Sapphire! What's more personal to us than FUSION?!?!
[Camera shows Steven watching, uncomfortable]
Sapphire: I know, you're still upset.
Ruby: Oh, so it's just me?
Sapphire: Of course not. *monotone* Can't you see I'm completely engulfed with rage? *turns to face Ruby, expressionless*
Ruby: Well, it doesn't feel like it. *starts tapping her foot impatiently*
Sapphire: *starts to levitate* The sooner we forgive Pearl, the better it will be for us all.
Ruby: *yelling* You're... not... as above this... as you... think you are! *grunts angrily, steaming in her eyes*
Sapphire: *floats onto the bed* Yes, I am.
(Ruby paces around the room and gets even angrier.)
Sapphire: You can't stay angry with her forever.
Ruby: *turns and points at Sapphire* Wanna bet?
Sapphire: Ruby, the carpet.
(Ruby looks down and sees the carpet burning, with smoke emanating from her feet.)
Ruby: You... can't even... Argh!
(Ruby storms out of the room and slams the door behind her, leaving burnt footprints on the floor.)
Steven: Nice to... see you again?
Sapphire: Nice to see you, too.
[Time-Skip]
(Steven exits the room in his bathing suit, towel in hand, and walks towards the pool, following Ruby's footprints. There, he sees Ruby pacing around on the poolside angrily.)
Steven: *nervously* Hey, Ruby! You wanna swim in the pool?
Ruby: It's fusion, Steven! *continues pacing* It's like Sapphire doesn't even care! And we're supposed to be the bigger Gem about this. *throws her hands up in the air, shouting* We're ALLLLLLWAYS!- the bigger Gem! Well not this time! Not—about—this!
Steven: Come on, w-why don't you come cool down in the pool? Hup! *cannonballs into the pool*
Ruby: I don't need to "cool down".
Steven: Come on, Ruby! The water's niiice~!
Ruby: *hesitates* Why does she always act like I'm being ridiculous? *walks to the bottom of the pool and continues pacing* Just because she wants to pretend like she doesn't have feelings? Oh yeah! I don't have any feelings... (Her words are muffled by water.)
Steven: Uhh, Ruby? ... You made a warm spot! (The water around him starts to bubble.) Aah! A hot spot! Boiling! (He turns red, quickly climbs out of the boiling pool and starts panting.) Uhh... I'm gonna go back to the room.
(Steven leaves the pool, as Ruby continues to rant underwater. He then returns back into the motel room, now freezing cold, and turns blue with chill.)
Steven: Phew... *shivers and wraps his towel around himself* Sapphire?
Sapphire: Hello, Steven.
Steven: *stuttering* A-Are you... d-d-doin' ok?
Sapphire: I'm... fine.
(Frost forms on the wall behind Sapphire as she speaks.)
Steven: Okay... *jumps on his bed* Wanna watch TV together?
Sapphire: Sure.
Steven: *turns on the TV* Huh... T-The channels are all the wrong numbers... Hey... can you use your future powers to predict what channel I'd love the most?
Sapphire: Hmm... 43. But there's not much on.
(Steven switches to the channel and covers himself in the bed blankets, as the frost behind Sapphire grows.)
Steven: Hey, S-Sapphire?
Sapphire: Even if I do, Ruby won't listen.
Steven: Huh?
Sapphire: You're going to say I should talk to Ruby, but it won't help.
Steven: B-But she seems really upset.
Sapphire: That doesn't matter. We can't stay mad at Pearl forever, and she can't stay mad at me forever, and then she'll come back and see that I'm right.
Steven: *shivering, with ice crystals forming on his face* A-A-Are you s-s-sure?
Sapphire: I can see the path of fate as it stretches toward the horizon. Ruby can't avoid the inevitable. She's just letting her emotions get out of hand.
Steven: N-N-Not you though?
Sapphire: No.
(The frost behind Sapphire intensifies.)
Steven: I'm... going to the bathroom. *walks into the bathroom*
Sapphire: Also inevitable.
Steven: Uhh... Sapphire? The toilet's frozen...
Sapphire: Such is fate.
Steven: *annoyed* Am I fated to pee outside in the grass too? *walks outside, and shuts the door*
Sapphire: ... Yes.
Steven: *grumbles* Keystone state-
(Headlights shine upon Steven, as Greg's van pulls over and parks outside the room.)
Greg: Hey, schtu-ball, I brought dinner! *holds up a pizza box*
Steven: Hey Dad, how'd it go?
Greg: Well, he wasn't an axe-murderer, so that was good. What are you doing outside in your bathing suit? And where's Garnet?
(Greg peeks in the room and sees Sapphire sitting on the bed, surrounded in frost.)
Sapphire: He's not gonna like that it's square...
Greg: *quickly closes the door* Oh boy... Where's the other one?
Steven: She's pacing around in what used to be the pool.
(Ruby is seen still pacing around the bottom of the pool, now steaming with no water.)
Greg: Something pretty serious must be going on if it made Garnet split up. *sits in the back of his van* But hey! We can still have a good time! *opens the pizza box, revealing a square pizza*
Steven: SQUARE PIZZA?! What's wrong with this crazy state?!
Greg: Son, there will come a time in your life when you learn to accept all pizza.
Steven: *takes a pizza cut* Why can't Ruby and Sapphire just... make up?
Greg: Sometimes people that love each other can hurt each other's feelings without meaning to. We should just give them some space.
Steven: But I think they'd work it out if they'd just talk to each other!
Greg: Everything will be better in the morning. We'll all go to The Best Diner in the World, where we'll eat the best breakfast in the world!
Steven: You think that'll help?
Greg: Nothing like a little breakfast to bring people together! *nudges Steven*
Steven: You really are my favorite dad.
Greg: *takes a pizza cut too* I knew this pizza would put me over the top...
[Trans Int. The Best Diner in the World, The Next Day]
(Steven, Greg, Ruby, and Sapphire are sitting at a table. Steven is playing with a spoon, Greg is whistling awkwardly, Ruby leans on the table, facing away from Sapphire and angrily tapping a finger, while Sapphire is sitting patiently and quietly. A waitress then brings four breakfast plates.)
Greg: Hey! Thank you!
Steven: Thanks!
(Ruby stares blankly at the breakfast plate in front of her, with eggs, bacon and a strawberry arranged into smiling faces.)
Greg: What's the matter? Not hungry? *Ruby looks up at him*
Steven: Gems don't need to eat, Dad.
Greg: Eh... Well Garnet likes to eat sometimes.
Ruby: ARGH! Well Garnet's not here! *throws herself against the booth seat, crossing her arms, wiggling her foot impatiently*
(Steven and Greg awkwardly begin to eat.)
Greg: *nervously* Mmm... Oh boy, this really is "The Best Diner in the World"!
(Ruby starts to shake the table impatiently.)
Sapphire: You're shaking the table.
Ruby: *bangs the table and continues shaking it.* Hah, I'M kinda surprised you felt anything at all, to be honest!
Sapphire: I didn't need to feel, I saw.
Ruby: EVERYTHING IS JUST SO... CRYSTAL - CLEAR - TO - YOU - ISN'T IT?!?!
(Ruby begins to shake the table violently, causing Steven and Greg to frantically lift their plates off the table.)
Sapphire: *leans to Steven and Greg* This will pass. She'll eventually just burn herself out.
Ruby: THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK! *summons her gauntlet* I AM AN ETERNAL FLAME, BABY!!!!
(Ruby smashes the table with her gauntlet, causing it to flip over and everything to spill off it.)
Ruby: *argues with Sapphire* You don't know me!
Sapphire: *argues with Ruby * How could I possibly not know you, we always fuse—
Ruby: Look at you! Awww-haw-haw.
Sapphire: We always fuse. Look at you. Look at what you're going on about...
Ruby: YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOURSELF! HAH!
(As Ruby and Sapphire argues in the background, Steven sees one of the breakfasts has turned into a frown. He then starts tearing up in dismay.)
Greg: *smiling nervously at Steven* Hey, it's okay pal! We can still save this! Why don't we just bag them up to go, and-
Ruby: YOU’RE JUST A... A..
Sapphire: Yes? Yes?
(Steven drops his plate onto the floor, Ruby and Sapphire immediately stop arguing, and storms outside with tears in his eyes.)
Greg: Aww jeez...
(Ruby and Sapphire look at each other and chases after Steven outside.)
Ruby & Sapphire: Steven!
Steven: I was so happy when Garnet said she was gonna come on this trip with me and Dad! Home's been awful! Here's been awful! (Ruby and Sapphire look at each other, worried looks on their faces.) I thought you wanted to have a fun time but, everyone's been acting awful too! It-It just came with us! I don't understand! Is it... is it me? *looks down in disappointment*
Ruby: No! Steven, it's all us!
Sapphire: But we made him feel... like it was his fault. *holds her hand over her mouth* I keep looking into the future, when all of this has already been solved... As if it doesn't matter how you feel in the present... *starts to cry* No wonder you think I don't care!
Ruby: Sapphire... No, no no no no no no no! This is all my fault! I-I didn't want to look for a solution, I-I just wanted to be mad! Y-You're right! You're always right! I was being stupid!
Sapphire: I don't think you're stupid!
Ruby: I'm... sorry...
(Ruby brushes Sapphire's hair to the side, revealing a single crying blue eye.)
Sapphire: You honestly think I'm not upset about what happened? I was just... trying to do the right thing... (Ruby wipes her tears away.)
Ruby: I know...
(Sapphire sighs and holds Ruby's hand against her cheek.)
Ruby: *smiling* You know what's nice about being split up?
Sapphire: What? *looks concerned*
Ruby: I get to look at you.
(Ruby grins, and Sapphire pushes her away, scoffing and laughing.)
Sapphire: *laughing* Be serious!
Ruby: *hugs Sapphire* There's my Laughy Sapphy! *laughs mischievously*
Sapphire: *blushes* Shh! You're embarrassing me in front of Steven!
(Steven looks away, embarrassed. Ruby and Sapphire continues laughing and giggling, as Ruby throws Sapphire into the air, catches her and kisses her on the cheek and neck. Steven blushes, covers his eyes, lays on the ground, and sighs.)
Greg: *walks up to Steven* Well, I paid for breakfast... And the damage to the booth... Anywho, I think I'm all vacationed out. Ready to call it a day?
(Steven takes a breath, as if he is going to say something, when he is interrupted by Ruby and Sapphire fusing.)
Garnet: *smiling and adjusting her visors* Not before we get our free ice.
Steven: *starry eyed* Garnet!
[Trans. Int. Beach House]
Steven: We're home!
(Steven and Greg enter the house, holding a bag of ice. Pearl, looking sad, is seen talking to Amethyst with her hand on Pearl's knee.)
Pearl: I just don't know why I keep- (Amethyst quickly takes her hand off of Pearl's leg and waves to Steven and Greg.) *notices Steven and Greg* Oh! Uh- You look like you all had fun!
Steven: Yeah! It all worked out!
(Garnet is seen standing behind them.)
Pearl: Garnet, how are you?
Garnet: *holds up her hand* Not now. *walks away*
Pearl: She's speaking to me again... Kind of.
Greg: That really was a great trip.
Steven: *gasps* Can we go back?
Greg: Maybe one day... *ruffles Steven's hair* But, not to that diner! (The star iris closes in on Greg's face.) Oh boy...
