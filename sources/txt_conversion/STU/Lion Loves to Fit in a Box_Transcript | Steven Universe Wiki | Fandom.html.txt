[Title Card: "Lion loves to fit in a box"]
[Open Int. Beach House]
(Lion is seen jumping into a wide yet shallow box and getting comfy in it. He turns around and spots Steven recording his quirkiness in a video.)
(Lion walks up to a cardboard cylinder and sticks his face into it. He then struggles to get it off, before turning towards Steven again.)
(Lion steps on top of a box with small holes on it. His legs slip and fall into square holes, getting startled and accidentally splitting the box apart.)
(Lion puts all four of his paws into tissue boxes and begins walking around like they are footwear. He then pauses and drops to the ground.)
(Lion begins charging into the opening of a box and shoving himself inside on three occasions, startling Amethyst at the fridge. Amethyst then brings out another box from her room, only to be charged at by Lion, pinning her against the Temple Gate.)
[Trans. Ext. The Big Donut]
(Setting the camera down somewhere, Steven throws some trash bags out of a dumpster to make room for Lion.)
Steven: Okay. Go ahead, Lion.
(Lion jumps in, landing inside the dumpster with a loud thunk. Steven chuckles as he films Lion curled up comfortably inside, when Lars exits the back door of the shop with more trash bags.)
Lars: *startled* Aaah! Again?!
