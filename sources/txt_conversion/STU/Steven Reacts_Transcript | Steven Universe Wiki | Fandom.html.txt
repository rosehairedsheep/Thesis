[Open Int. Steven's Room]
(Steven is filming himself in his room, as he screams into the camera.)
Steven: HOOOOO!! Guys! It's time for a new episode of "CRYING BREAKFAST FRIENDS!!" You guys, I'm so excited it's finally back. I even stayed off the internet all day 'cause I didn't want to get... spoiled! *chuckles* Because they're food? I know I used that joke last week, but for real, this is supposed to be a big one. Alright. Play!
(Steven presses a "Play" button off-screen and "Crying Breakfast Friends!" begins to play on a small screen on the bottom left screen, as he sings along to the opening theme.)
Steven: ♪ Tears of sorrow, tears of joy. ♪ There'll be tears till the very end. ♪ Food with feelings, ♪ Crying Breakfast Friends! ♪
(The title of the episode is shown: "Party Crashers". It opens with Pear, wearing a party hat and standing in the middle of an empty party.)
Steven: Huh. That looks fun.
(Pear looks around and starts to cry.)
Steven: Oh, Pear. *winks*
(Spoon walks onto the scene with Fried Egg and Waffle.)
Spoon: What's wrong, Pear?
Steven: It's Spoon!
Spoon: Why are you crying?
Pear: Oh, Spoon. I invited my friends over for a breakfast party. *hyperventilates* But... nobody... came! *cries harder*
Steven: Aww...
Spoon: Oh, but- but that's why we're here.
Steven & Pear: Huh?
(Spoon, Fried Egg and Waffle are joined by Bacon Strips and Milk.)
Spoon: We came for your party. I'm sorry we were late! Please forgive us! *begins to tear up*
Pear: *sprays tears* Aaahh, I forgive you! *continues to cry*
Spoon: Yay!
(Everyone begins to cry, including Steven.)
Steven: Yes! Conflict resolved! Sweet catharsis! Huh, I didn't think I would be crying this early into the episode.
(Suddenly, an ominous entity looms over the breakfast friends.)
Spoon: Ah, what!?
Pear: Aaaeeeee!
Steven: W-w-w-wha? What's that?
(The ominous entity is a refrigerator.)
Steven: It's a fridge!? Is it more food? French toast?
(The fridge opens and three angry figures jump out: Burger, Sandwich, and Pizza.)
Steven: Oh my gosh. Is this... Is this...
Sandwich: Breakfast time is over.
Steven: I think I know what this is.
Burger: Clear the table!
Pizza: Yeah. Get a box to go.
Sandwich: There's only room for one meal at a time, and that's us.
Burger, Sandwich, & Pizza: The "Angry Lunch Enemies"!
Steven: It's lunch! I knew it! Theory confirmed!
(Pear keeps crying at the situation, until Burger approaches.)
Burger: Stop crying!
Steven: Hey!
Spoon: Wait! Maybe there can be two meals at the same time! Wanna try it?
Sandwich: *groans* Okay, but I'm angry about it.
Steven: What?
Spoon: Fried Egg!
Steven: No...
Spoon: Avocado! Bacon Strips!
Steven: *excitedly* Yes! Please!
(Fried Egg, Avocado and Bacon Strips begin to place themselves in between Sandwich, becoming...)
Steven: *gasps loudly* Brunch! They're brunch!
(Sandwich starts crying in joy, when the credits suddenly begin to roll.)
Steven: Huh? It's over? Wow! I can't wait for the next episode, whenever that is, am I right? *winks* Okay, friends! See ya next time!
