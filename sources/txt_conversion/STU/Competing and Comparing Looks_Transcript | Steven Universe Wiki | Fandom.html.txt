Smoky Quartz: Hey I'm Smoky Quartz.
Sardonyx: And I'm the lovely Sardonyx.
Smoky Quartz: Sardonyx and I look pretty different, but she's got 3 gems, I got 2, she's got 4, and I got 3. Her body can rotate... 360 degrees. [looks down sadly] Hey, cut. Just gimme a minute.
Sardonyx: Smoky..?
Smoky Quartz: I know this thing is how we both how amazing bodies and stuuf, but you're always as obviously more amazing than mine.
Sardonyx: But that's not true. -- I know you look up to me.
Smoky Quartz: Yeah, you're 20 feet tall!
Sardonyx: But you can do things I can't do.
Smoky Quartz: Like what?
Sardonyx: Like fitting to your dressing room.
Smoky Quartz and Sardonyx laugh.
Smoky Quartz: OK you win. Or I guess I win. [summons her weapon] I think there's no time for triple handed yo-yo tricks.
Sardonyx: I hope so. I hate to think comparing yourself to me might to hurt your chance for you to be you. Let's get back out there. [grunts]
Smoky Quartz: A little help!?
Sardonyx: Please don't film this.
