[Open Ext. Crystal Temple]
(Steven is lying on the couch in the living room of the Beach House, talking on his phone with Connie.)
Steven: What...? Why not?
[Trans. Int. Connie's house]
Connie: Steven, I told you, I can't hang out today. I have tennis practice. And then Mom wants to go out for a family dinner. But she said I could hang out all day tomorrow, and I can come over all the time now that it's summer vacation.
Steven: *flops off the couch* What's summer vacation?
Connie: You know, when school gets out for the summer?
Steven: I've never been to this... How do you say— "school". How does it work?
Connie: It's a place where you go to learn. It's full of desks, chalkboards...
Steven: Hmm.
Connie: Books, maps.
Steven: I see.
(Shortly after, Steven begins to assemble a pile of school equipment in the kitchen, with the help of Pearl.)
Steven: *examines the pile* Yep, it's all coming together.
Pearl: *adds a desk to the pile* So, how do we begin our "school"?
Steven: Ugh... I... I don't know! This is everything Connie told me. Why do I never ask follow-up questions?! Who will teach little Stevie now!?
Pearl: *gasps* Teach you?! Steven! If only I had known that's what you really wanted! *gets up* Twooooh! *begins doing the same dance as in "Lars and the Cool Kids"* Haaaaaah!
(Pearl's gem begins to glow, as she summons a mirror from her gem. She begins to explain as the mirror twirls in mid-air.)
Pearl: We found this Gem-powered mirror at the Galaxy Warp. It can capture and display any event it's witnessed in all of Gem history. (The mirror lands in Steven's hands.) It'll offer you everything you've ever wanted to know about your fellow Gems and our culture.
Steven: *looks at his reflection in the mirror* I must be incredibly important to Gem culture.
Pearl: *scoffs* It's just you in there. It hasn't even been activated. *clears her throat* Show us the Galaxy Warp. (The mirror does nothing.) Show. Us. The Galaxy Warp. *frustrated* Oh, come on! *grabs the mirror*
Steven: *still holding onto the mirror and gets lifted along* Whoa! *laughs*
Pearl: I know you've seen it. *examines the mirror and sighs* It is in pretty rough shape. It must finally be broken. What a shame.
Steven: *admires himself in the mirror* Doesn't seem broken to me!
Pearl: Oh well. I guess that's the end of our school.
Steven: *gets excited* Whoa. Wha... So you could say... School's out for summer?
Pearl: Yes. Good, Steven. There are many ways to say the same thing.
Steven: *gasps* School's out! *runs out of the house*
Pearl: *looking at the pile* Hmm. The asymmetry of this pile is really starting to bother me.
[Trans. Ext. Beach House]
Steven: *running down the beach* School's out! Happy summer vacation, Steven! *starts running backwards* Happy summer vacation, Beach City! *chuckles* Yeah!
(Not looking where he is going, Steven bumps into Lars and Sadie, who are setting up tables outside the Big Donut.)
Lars & Sadie: Hey! (The table falls over.)
Lars: Ugh, watch where you're going, you little f... *glances at Sadie* Ssssteven!
Steven: Sorry! I'm just so excited for summer. Are you excited for summer? I'm so excited for summer!
Sadie: *laughs* Uh, I think I'm as excited as I can get about setting up extra seating for the summer rush. But Lars has big plans.
Lars: You bet I do! All those out-of-town summer babes traveling away from home without their boyfriends, if you know what I mean. *jitters his eyebrows*
Steven: *looks cluelessly* ...Nope.
Lars: Maybe I'll get a few numbers. Maybe I'll even... call one.
Sadie: Ha! Well, yeah, maybe I'll meet a new friend.
Steven: That's a great idea! A special new friend to have fun on the beach with in the summer. Maybe if I keep using the mirror to guide me, I'll walk backwards into my own beach-summer-fun buddy! *holds the mirror out and starts walking backwards*
Lars: Next time you see me, I'll be on the arm of a hot woman!
Sadie: You can stop talking about it now.
Steven: *running backwards and laughing, and then begin imitating Michael Jackson and moonwalking* ♪ Wo, Wo, Wo, Wo! ♪ Wo, Wo, Wo, Wo! ♪ Wo, Wo, Hee-Hee! ♪
(Steven moonwalks into the boardwalk, when Mayor Dewey's Van, reflected by the mirror and chanting "May-or Dew-ey", is driving towards him.)
Mirror: *as Lars* Er, watch where you're going, you little!
Steven: Huh? *sees the mirror, and then the van* Nooo!
(Steven screams in fear and the van halts just in front of him.)
Mayor Dewey: *leans out of the van and speaks into a megaphone* Car wash kid, what are you doing?!
Steven: I don't know. Why were you driving down the boardwalk?
Mayor Dewey: I'm the mayor, I'm not going to walk anywhere. Now, go get run over somewhere else. I'm late for a speech.
(The van maneuvers around Steven and begins to drive off again.)
Steven: *looks at the mirror* What just happened?
Mirror: *projects Steven laughing*
Steven: You work! This is so cool! What's it like being a mirror?
Mirror: *projects Steven again* You work!
Steven: So you can repeat stuff?
Mirror: Yeah!
Mayor Dewey: *giving a speech on the beach* Hello, Beach City, my friends! It's great to be here to celebrate the coming season. A warm summer breeze wafts through the air.
Steven: *inhales deeply and makes fart noises* PBHT!
(The crowd snickers.)
Mayor Dewey: We all look forward to the sounds of the summer season...
Mirror: PBHT!
Mayor Dewey: ... the smells of the busy boardwalk...
Mirror: PBHT!
Mayor Dewey: ... the hot, wet ocean wind...
Mirror: PBHT!
Mayor Dewey: ... the time to take that pressure that's built up all year and just let it out.
Mirror: PBHT!
(The crowd laughs aloud.)
Steven: Wow, you picked that up fast.
(Time passes by, Steven remians on the beach, still playing with the mirror.)
Mirror: PBHT!
Steven: *laughs* You got a lot of mileage out of that joke. You're pretty funny for a mirror.
Mirror: You're pretty funny for a mirror.
Steven: *chuckles* I'm not a mirror.
Mirror: You're pretty funny for a- Ssssteven!
Steven: *gasps* You made something new! Say something else!
Mirror: Ssssteven— is— a new friend.
Steven: *blushing* Really?
Mirror: Yeah!
Steven: You're my friend, too!
Mirror: *laughs*
Steven: I got to go tell the Gems.
Mirror: Nooooo!
Steven: Don't be shy, they'll love you.
Mirror: *echoing* Nooooo!
Steven: *chuckles* Don't worry, they're a good audience.
[Trans. Int. Beach House]
Steven: *enters the house* Guys! Wait 'till you see-
(Steven sees Pearl arranging the pile of school equipment from before into a tower, while Garnet and Amethyst watch on.)
Amethyst: Yo! Ste-man!
Pearl: Hello, Steven.
Garnet: Howdy. *makes a finger gun* Bang.
Amethyst: Want to see something hilarious?
(Amethyst takes a M.C. Bear Bear toy and attempts to place it on the tower, which Pearl quickly impales with her spear. Amethyst then starts laughing.)
Pearl: You don't understand. Symmetrical means both sides have to be the same! *grunts angrily and tosses M.C. Bear-Bear into a pile of other stabbed items*
Steven: M.C. Bear-Bear! Okay, that's great. Anyway, I fixed the mirror!
Pearl: Excellent work, Steven!
Steven: You didn't tell me it's like a person.
(The Gems react in shock.)
Pearl: Wait. What?
Steven: Say "hey." ... Lil' buddy... (The mirror does nothing while the Gems still look shocked.) Uh... excuse us. *turns around* Come on. You want to come out, don't you? You have so much to say and funny noises to share from across the ages. Are we not beach-summer-fun buddies?
Mirror: *whirs* PBHT!
Steven: *laughs* Just couldn't help yourself, huh?
Mirror: *as Steven* Just- for- you! *as Lars* Ssssteven! *as Steven, laughs repeatedly*
Pearl: It's talking to him? It shouldn't be able to do that. I-it should just be following orders...
Amethyst: Garnet, do something.
Garnet: Steven. *walks towards him*
Mirror: *keeps laughing, and then Garnet approaches* Nooooo!
Garnet: You should just give us back the mirror. It will be safer where we can watch it.
Amethyst: Yeah, let's bubble it!
Mirror: Nooooo! *echoes repeatedly* Nooooo!
Steven: Wha...
Garnet: Steven. Don't make me have to take it from you.
Steven: *gasps* It doesn't want to go with you. Don't you hear it screaming?
Garnet: Steven, it's just a mirror, a tool. It can't want anything. *reaches for the mirror*
Mirror: *echoing repeatedly* Nooooo!
Steven: *growls* It wants to be with ME!
(Steven slaps Garnet's hand away, which hits her in the face and knocks her visor off. Amethyst gasps in extreme surprise, and Garnet glares at Steven in anger.)
Steven: Aah! Aah! *runs out of the house* I'm sorry!...
Garnet: *puts her visor back on and clenches her fists* That little boy... is in big trouble.
Pearl: Garnet, wait! I'm sure he didn't understand what he was doing!
[Trans. Ext. Beach House]
(The Gems exit the house to the beach.)
Garnet: Fan out.
Steven: *runs and hides behind a rock, panting heavily* What am I gonna do? What's their problem with you? Are you trying to say something?
Mirror: *whirs in distortion* Away from home- Let- Me- Out!
Steven: I don't understand!
Pearl: *calling from afar* Steven!
Steven: Come on! I want to help you! What can I do?
Mirror: *whirs and projects a scene of Steven pulling the gem out of the back of the mirror*
(Steven turns the mirror to its back and begins tugging on the gem. As he is pulling the gem, water from the sea begins to form the pattern of the mirror around Steven. After much effort, Steven manages to pull the gem out, and the mirror shatters. The gem then starts glowing in Steven's hand and levitates in mid-air. It reforms back into its physical, humanoid form and collapses onto the sand. )
Steven: *gasps* Wha... *runs towards the Gem*
Lapis: *turns to Steven* Thank you... You didn't— *struggles to stand, but Steven help her up* You actually talked to me. You helped me! It's Steven, right?
Steven: *breathes deeply* Mm.
Lapis: I'm Lapis -- Lapis Lazuli. Are you really a Crystal Gem?
Steven: Yeah!
Lapis: But you set me free.
Steven: But— Wha...
Garnet: STEVEN!!!!!
(The Gems approach and summon their weapons.)
Steven: *runs towards the Gems* Wait!
Lapis: You... *raises a huge water-arm out of the ocean* You three knew I was in there, and you didn't do anything. Did you even wonder who I USED TO BE!!
(Lapis slams the water-arm onto the Gems, trapping Garnet underneath it and knocking Pearl and Amethyst aside.)
Pearl: Steven, run!
Steven: What are you doing?
Lapis: I'm Lapis Lazuli, and you can't keep me trapped here anymore!
Steven: Huh?
Lapis: They're not going to let us leave.
Steven: Leave?
Lapis: *parts the ocean in half, creating a path through it* Steven, come with me.
Steven: Where?
Lapis: Home.
Steven: B-b-but... B-but I... Uh...
Lapis: Fine. *dispels the ocean path*
(Garnet manages to break free of the water-arm and punches it away. She then charges towards Steven and Lapis.
Lapis: Don't trust them, Steven. Goodbye.
(Lapis walks into the ocean, and create a huge wave that knocks Steven and Garnet back away. Pearl and Amethyst rush to their side.)
Pearl: Steven! *embraces Steven* Are you okay?
Steven: Yeah. I'm fine. So, that was another Gem?
Pearl: *sighs* Yes.
(The Crystal Gems gaze out to the ocean for the brief moment.)
Garnet: Steven, you're grounded.
(The star iris then zooms in on a distant star, ending the episode.)
