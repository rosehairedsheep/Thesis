(A title card of static image of Snack Sushi is shown, as it cuts to Lion in the kitchen, wearing a bowtie.)
Steven (Lion)
I am Lion, the host of the show, "Cooking with Lion".
(Lion yawns loudly as Steven introduces him in the manner of a cooking show.)
Steven: Hi, everyone. Today, we're going to make "Snack Sushi". This is a great dish to make if you're going to have friends over who don't like the taste of raw fish.
(Lion knocks an avocado off the table as Steven speaks.)
Steven (Lion)
Or if somebody has already eaten all of your tuna.
Steven: Oh, Lion. That- *chuckles briefly* That was a lot of tuna. And then you just threw it up into my shoes. But I've found a surprise replacement ingredient, so let's get started.
Steven (Lion)
First, use the spoon to cut slices into the flesh of the avocado, then run the spoon along the inside of the skin and transfer the slices to a plate.
(Steven spreads the slices of avocado on a plate.)
Steven (Lion)
Next, let's make the spicy mayo! In a bowl, combine mayonnaise and your favorite hot sauce to taste. I like it very spicy.
(Steven mixes the mayonnaise and spicy sauce together into a paste, all while Lion makes a derpy expression.)
Steven (Lion)
Let's prepare the sushi roll! On a bamboo rolling mat, place a sheet of seaweed paper rough side up. Using a rice paddle or spatula, spread the sushi rice onto the seaweed paper.
Steven: Click here for the "how to make Sushi Rice" video!
(Steven points upwards with his paddle at a button above him reading "click!".)
Steven (Lion)
Line up your avocado slices on top of the sushi rice. Now for the secret ingredient. Cheese puffs!
Steven: Make sure to use the smoother variety of puff for the proper texture.
(Steven takes a cheese puff out of a bag and Lions chomps onto it.)
Steven (Lion)
Line up your puffs along the avocado slices, then use the bamboo mat to roll up your sushi roll. Now, carefully slice your roll into six equally sized pieces.
(As Steven slices the sushi roll, Lion is seen licking himself with his leg high up in the air.)
Steven (Lion)
To finish, place a dollop of the spicy mayo on top of each piece of sushi, and garnish the plate with another dollop 'cause it's fancy.
Steven: Time to try one myself!
(Steven is about to eat a piece of sushi, when Lion shoves him away.)
Steven: Lion! No! At least save the flavors!
(Lion devours all of the sushi, before walking off.)
Steven (Lion)
The ingredients in this Snack Sushi are delicious. Be sure to serve fresh for a maximum crunch.
(The video ends as Steven's other recipes are promoted, such as the Together Breakfast and the Dog-Nuts. Another ending card promotes a recipe for Cookie Cat coming soon, along with the caption "Please subscribe".)
