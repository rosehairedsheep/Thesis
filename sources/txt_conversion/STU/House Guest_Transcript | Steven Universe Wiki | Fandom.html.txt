[Open Ext. It's a Wash!]
(Pearl is examining Greg's broken van, while Garnet and Amethyst lean nearby against the building.)
Pearl: *looking at the engine of the van* Wow. Those water constructs really did a number on Greg's van. Hmm... *looks at a broken tube*
Amethyst: Ah, give it a rest, Pearl. That thing will be busted forever.
Pearl: I completely disagree. It's just a simple human machine. I'm sure that I can figure this whole thing out before you know it!
Steven: Hey guys!
(Steven walks in, as Greg scoots over on a movable chair with a hockey stick, carrying a toolbox.)
Greg: Zoop! I got something that will patch this van up real good! *looks inside the toolbox*
Pearl: *gasps* Is it some kind of complex human tool?
Greg: Yup, high-quality duct tape! *shows Pearl a roll of duct tape* Some well placed duct tape can patch anything up in a pinch, see? *points to his broken leg, with a ruler duct-taped to it*
Pearl: I'm sure that I can fix this without your "tape".
Greg: Well, gee, at least let me give you a hand. *struggles to stand up*
Steven: Ah! Dad, be careful! (Greg fails to stand, and he sighs.) I'm sorry that you hurt your leg and that your van got smashed up because of me.
Greg: *pats his head* You apologize too much. Maybe I shouldn't have tagged along in that crazy adventure. But at least I got to spend some time with my fave guy!
Steven: What if you stayed with us until you got better?
Greg: Hey, that's a great idea! But, won't I get in the way of your training-
Pearl: *quickly interrupts* Yes!
Amethyst: Wait, Steven. Don't you have healing powers now?
Pearl: *smiles nervously* Oh, right, yes! You fix Greg, I'll fix the van. *mumbles under her breath* Nobody has to live with us.
Steven: *gasp* Yeah! Mm-hmm! Here goes something new and exciting. *licks his hand* And... go! *pats his saliva-covered hand on Greg's broken leg* Okay, you should be better now.
Greg: Okay, if you say so. *tries to stand up, but fails again*
Steven: Why didn't it work?
Greg: Hey, sorry, buddy. Maybe you just need a little more practice.
Steven: But... I was doing so well before!
Pearl: Steven, don't worry about it. Your powers are a bit fickle, after all.
Garnet: Just give it a bit more time.
Greg: Cheer up, Steven! At least now we get to spend some more time together, right?
Steven: Y-Yeah, right.
Garnet: Hmm...
Pearl: Garnet, can you give me a hand?
(Garnet lifts the front of Greg's van up, and the engine of the van falls right through it, startling Steven and Greg.)
Steven: *surprised* Ahh!
[Trans. Beach House]
(Steven and Greg throw some confetti in the air as they begin to engage in some father-and-son quality time, such as cooking breakfast, watching videos on Steven's Phone, Steven washing Greg clean after he spilled soda on himself, and singing "Dear Old Dad" together. After the song, Steven, Greg, and Amethyst are seen making paper airplanes in the living room.)
Amethyst: Bombs away!
(Amethyst throws her paper airplane in the air and it hits Greg on the nose. The three start to laugh and when Pearl enters from outside, covered in oil from repairing Greg's van. She drops Greg's toolbox and wipes herself clean up, when Garnet appears as well.)
Garnet: You're back. The Geode is cracked, we must leave immediately.
Pearl: What?!
Amethyst: Oh, no!
(Pearl and Amethyst rushes towards the Warp Pad.)
Garnet: You too, Steven.
Steven: *stands up excitedly* Yeah!
Greg: Aw, really?
Steven: Oh! Oh yeah.
Greg: *frowns* It's okay, Steven, I'll be fine. You go on your mission.
Steven: Are you sure?
Greg: Of course.
Steven: Thanks, Dad! We'll be back before you know it! *runs to the warp pad*
Greg: Okay. Don't worry about your old man. My leg's not getting any more broken. If I need something, I'll just... crawl. *gets teary* My arms are still not... broken.
Amethyst: Oh, brother.
(The Crystal Gems gets off the warp pad and walk towards Greg.)
Pearl: Now, Greg, there's no need to be so pathetic. If anything happens to you, you can call us with this. *Pearl pulls out a small flute and hands it to Greg*
Greg: *gasps* What is it?
Garnet: It's a Warp Whistle.
Greg: *in awe* Warp Whistle...
Garnet: If you blow in it, the warp pad will activate and will alert us that we need to return.
Steven: See, Dad? You'll be fine.
Greg: *sighs* Right, I'll be fine. Good luck on your mission, son.
[Trans. Ent. Geode]
(The Crystal Gem warp and arrive at the warp pad outside the Geode, as a lightning storm is brewing over.)
Amethyst: Man, this place is janked up.
Steven: Wow. Was there an explosion or something?
Garnet: *walks ahead* Almost.
Pearl: What you're looking at is a synthetic storm that was contained in—
(A whistling sound is heard out of nowhere, interrupting Pearl's explanation.)
Amethyst: Is that the Warp Whistle?
Steven: Ah! Dad needs me, I'll be right back! *warps back to the Beach house* Dad! I'm here! Is everything...?
Greg: Oh, hey, Steven! Just making sure that this thing actually works. Heh.
Steven: Okay, we'll be back later! *warps back to the Geode* Sorry for the holdup!
Pearl: Is everything okay?
Amethyst: Hey, did Greg fall down and break his butt? Ha ha!
Garnet: That's not funny.
Amethyst: *looks down sadly* I know.
Pearl: Like I was saying, this is a synthetic—
(The Warp Whistle is heard for the second time, interrupting Pearl again.)
Steven: I'm sure it's very important. *warps back to the Beach house* Dad?
Greg: *scratches back of his head* I'm really sorry, but where's the remote?
Steven: That's actually... a very important question.
(Steven warps back to the Geode after helping Greg out.)
Steven: It was very important.
Pearl: Okay, so if the Geode breaks, then the storm will be unleashed and our bodies will be vaporized. *points at the Geode, which is absorbing the lightning**
Steven: Then... we'd be dead.
Garnet: That's where you come in. *turns to Steven*
Steven: Say what?
Garnet: You should try and seal that crack with your healing powers.
Steven: But... what if... I can't do it?
Garnet: It won't hurt to try.
Steven: Okay.
(Steven walks toward the Geode, still doubting his power, when he sees the Gems silently cheering him on. He then begins to attempt healing the Geode with a palm covered in his saliva, but nothing happens. He begins to strain himself as the Gems watch in worry.)
Steven: IT'S NOT WORKING! Ugh... I knew this would happen. Just when I thought I was getting better.
Garnet: Don't beat yourself up, Steven.
Amethyst: Yeah, don't worry about it!
Pearl: We'll find another way!
Steven: Eh. You don't understand. How am I supposed to call myself a Crystal Gem, if I can't even—
(The Warp Whistle suddenly sounds again for the third time, this time interrupting Steven. All the Crystal Gems decide to warp back to the Beach House.)
Steven: Dad? Dad?! Daaad! *runs up to his bedroom and see Greg lying in front of his TV* Dad! Are you okay? Answer me!
Greg: *suddenly wakes up* Steven! You just missed... the funniest commercial.
Steven: ... What?
Greg: *laughs* It was that one for the dog treats where the dog's dressed up like a doctor. If I ever get heartworms, I'm eating those dog treats.
Steven: Dad! You're only supposed to use the Warp Whistle for emergencies. Like if you fell down and broke your butt!
Greg: Ah, haha, yeah... Sorry about that.
Steven: *sigh* It's okay.
Greg: Since you're here, mind grabbing me a snack from the Big Donut?
Steven: Yeah, sure thing. *climbs down the steps and turns to the Gems* I'll be right back guys.
Garnet: We'll be in the temple. *walks off*
Pearl: We have to come up with another plan, quick.
Amethyst: Yo, dude, no worries about earlier. You'll get a hold of your powers before ya know it! *holds a thumbs-up to Steven*
Steven: Thanks, Amethyst!
Amethyst: Get me a croissant. *walks towards the temple*
Steven: *exits the house* Ah, I forgot to ask Dad what kind of donuts he wants. Ugh... *goes back inside* Hey, Dad, I—
(Steven is alarmed to find Greg at the fridge, searching for food and dancing on his "broken" leg.)
Greg: Olé! *notices Steven* Steven! *drops all the food he is carrying* Ha, you had me scared there, son. Didn't see you... standing in the doorway. Your old man's still got it!
(Steven angrily glares at Greg.)
Greg: What, this? I guess I couldn't wait for those donuts.
(Steven crosses his arms, and Greg realizes that Steven is referring to his "broken" leg.)
Greg: Uhh. Oh yeah... *pretends that his leg still hurts* Ugh... Ouch... Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! *rolls on the floor*
Steven: Just stop, Dad. I get what's going on. Your leg isn't broken at all, is it?
Greg: It was broken, but you healed it back at the car wash.
Steven: You lied to me! Now I can't do it anymore!
Greg: What?
Steven: The Gems needed me to fix the broken rock, but my healing powers aren't working. It-it's because of you, you messed with my head!
Greg: No! I didn't mean to... I just wanted to live with my son again!
Steven: I really thought I was getting better, I finally felt like a Crystal Gem. Now, what if I can't do... anything? *tears up*
Greg: Steven, don't beat yourself up! This is my fault!
Steven: Yeah! Yeah it is! *runs outside the house* Ughh! What am I going to do? My powers, they're— *sees his ukulele and Greg's guitar nearby, remembers the times they had together, and walks back inside* I'm sorry, I... *gasps* Dad!
(Steven sees Greg standing on the warp pad, with the Warp Whistle and his toolbox.)
Greg: It's time for me to fix the trouble I've caused.
Steven: Nooooo!
(Greg blows into the Warp Whistle, activating the warp pad, and warps away. Steven quickly jumps into the warp stream, and both of them warp to the Geode.)
Steven: Dad, be careful!
Greg: Don't worry, Steven! Your old man's gonna- Whoa! *trips and falls down the crater*
Steven: Daaad! *catches up to Greg* Are you okay?
(The lightning storm begin to worsen, as the Geode is unable to contain the storm any longer, generating strong winds and striking lightning everywhere.)
Greg: Steven, get out of here! I'm responsible for this!
Steven: No, you're not.
Greg: But, I messed up your powers! I did everything I'm not supposed to do, and now you can't heal!
Steven: I healed you, right?
Greg: Hey, get in there and patch things up, just like you patched up your old man!
Steven: *runs up to the Geode* Double... healing... powers! *licks both his hands and pats them on the Geode, but still nothing happens* It's still not working!
Greg: Ah, forget it! I've got another idea!
(Greg spread a strip of duct tape over the crack in the Geode, sealing it up. The lightning storm quickly calms and subsides.)
Greg: There, see, as good as new!
[Trans. Ext. Temple]
(The Crystal Gems and Greg are gathered on the beach. Greg is admiring his now-repaired van in awe, looking almost brand new, while Pearl reads a checklist of repairs she performed on the van.)
Greg: No way.
Pearl: So, I've realigned the axles...
Greg: I can't believe it!
Pearl: *continued* ...replaced the spark plugs...
Greg: It's never looked this good!
Pearl: *still continued* ...sealed the leaks in the intake manifold gaskets, and recalibrated the timing belt. As long as you ease up on second gear, your transmission should be fine.
Greg: Pearl! I can't thank you enough! Haha!
(Greg hugs Pearl tightly, as she reacts in disgust. After Greg releases Pearl, she shivers and crawls backwards, hiding behind Garnet.)
Greg: So, now that I'm feeling better, it's about time that I move back home. Can't have me messing up more magic stuff.(Steven walks over and hugs Greg.) Just in case you have trouble again... *hands over the roll of duct tape to Steven*
[Trans. Int. Beach House]
(Steven heads to bed for the night, with the roll of duct tape on the nightstand next to him.)
Steven: Good night, Dad!
Greg: Good night, Steven!
[Trans. Ext. Beach House]
(Greg's van is parked on the beach just outside the Beach House, as Greg also turns in for the night. Two heart irises, instead of stars, zoom in on the Beach House and Greg's van, ending the episode.)
