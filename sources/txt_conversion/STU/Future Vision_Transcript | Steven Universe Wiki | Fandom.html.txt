[Open on Beach House]
(Steven is about to do some spring cleaning in his room.)
Steven: *brings in an empty box speaks to someone in his room* Okay, everyone. I think we all know what's going on here. I'm sure you knew this day was coming sooner or later.
(It reveals that Steven is talking to his action figures.)
Steven: I understand your concern, but that language was inappropriate. I'm a Crystal Gem, I'm a big boy now. And I got to stop saying stuff like, "I'm a big boy now". *makes a cute pose briefly*
(Steven starts putting his action figures into the box.)
Steven: Look, I'm sure this is tough, but let's all be positive about this. *sees his "Ninja Squad" poster on his wall* Man, I guess I can't be in the Ninja Squad anymore. Get out of my life, Ninja Squad! *takes down the poster, and replaces it with a new one* Yeah! New Ninja Squad!
(Steven finishes up his spring cleaning and prepares to leave with a box full of old belongings.)
Steven: Mm. That's everything for now. Hmm? *sees a teddy bear on the floor and picks it up* Oh. Master of Ceremonies Bear Bear. *talks to it sadly* I guess... I should get rid of you, too? *smiles again* Nah. You never know when I'll need a cool DJ for a fun party, right?
(Steven starts climbing down the steps of his room, when he accidentally steps on a tennis ball. He trips and gets flung into the air. He screams as he falls, only to be caught by Garnet at the bottom of the steps.)
Steven: Uh... Garnet!
Garnet: Good morning to you, Steven.
Steven: Boy, I sure am lucky you showed up when you did.
Garnet: *puts Steven down* Luck's got nothing to do with it. *adjusts her visor*
Steven: Wait. What do you mean by that? *kneels down and starts picking up all the belongings spilled from the box*
Garnet: *kneels down too to help Steven* Don't worry about it.
Steven: No, seriously. How do you always know where to be?
Garnet: Mmm. *smiles and hands Master of Ceremonies Bear Bear to Steven* I don't think you can handle that information.
Steven: Are you gonna tell me something cool about yourself? *smiles excitedly*
Garnet: Nope.
Steven: *frowns* Aw, come on.  I'm a b-... large... man now.
Garnet: Well... I guess you could say that I have a sort of... future vision. (Her visor sparkles.) I'm able to see possible outcomes to most situations, which comes in handy since you seem to attract a lot of danger.
Steven: *smirks* Well, danger is my middle name.
Garnet: That's a lie. Your middle name, is cutie-pie. *boops Steven's nose*
Steven: Haaa!
[Trans. Beach]
(Garnet and Steven are seen working out on the beach, in rhythm to a stereo playing an exercise track similar to the Korean National Gymnastics track.
Stereo: *in Korean* Let's exercise! Cha! One... two!... Two... two!... Three... two!... Four... two!... Five... two!... Six... two!... Seven... two!... Eight... two!...
(Garnet then summons her gauntlets while Steven picks up a pair of dumbbells, and they continue some weightlifting exercises.
Stereo: *in Korean* Continue! One... two!... Two... two!... Three... two!... Four... two!... Five... two!... Six... two!... Seven... two!... Eight... tw-
(Garnet raises her gauntlet and smashes the stereo, ending the workout by force.)
Garnet: Okay, we're done.
Steven: *puts his dumbbells down in slight dismay* But the day still has so much potential!  Garnet, what are my breakfast possibilities?
Garnet: Well, you're already outside, so you'll probably go to the Big Donut.
Steven: Wow... That's amazing. *scratches his head, while Garnet dispels her gauntlets* Um, do you see any possible futures where you, um, come with me and have a great time?
Garnet: Hmm...
(Garnet glares at Steven while he stares at her with starry eyes, wiggling his eyebrows all around, while chiptune music whirs in and out.)
Garnet: *adjusts her visor* Yes.
Steven: *gasps* Really?! Then let's go! *grabs Garnet by the hand and strolls down the beach with her* So, can Pearl and Amethyst see the future, too?
Garnet: No one can see the future. (Garnet starts explaining her ability, as imagery projects on her visor.) I can see options and trajectories. Time is like a river that splits into creeks, or pools into lakes, or careens down waterfalls. *adjusts her visor as the imagery disappears* I have the map, and I steer the ship.
Steven: *dumbfounded* I see...
[Trans. Int. Big Donut]
(The shop door chimes as Garnet opens it for Steven to enter.)
Steven: So, what would happen if I said "hi" to Sadie?
Garnet: The most probable outcome is that Sadie will say "hi" back.
Steven: *ponders* Hmm... Hi, Sadie!
Sadie: Oh, hi, Steven.
Steven: *laughs and turns to Garnet* Oh, that was an easy one. What would happen if... I said "hi" to my BFF, Lars?! *points to Lars by the coffee machine* Our friendship is deep, but complicated. So the outcome of this experiment is waaaay unpredictable!
Garnet: I see a single potential future where Lars gives you a high five. (Steven gasps and looks at Garnet in hopeful eyes.) And two more potential futures where you suffer third-degree burns all over your body.
Steven: *ignoring the last part* A high five... from Lars! *runs towards Lars* Hi, Lars!
(Lars gets startled and throws a pitcher full of hot coffee overhead. It starts falling towards Steven, when Garnet steps in and blocks the pitcher with her body, drenching her in hot coffee. Sadie covers her mouth in shock.)
Lars: Criminy! Are you okay?! That coffee was really hot!
Garnet: I drink coffee for breakfast. *shrugs the coffee off her body*
Steven: *nervously chuckles* Funny.
[Trans. Ext. Beach Citywalk Fries]
(Steven then approaches the BC Fries, where Peedee is lying on the counter, to get his regular order.)
Steven: *talks to Peedee* You know exactly what I want. *turns around and talks to Garnet, while Peedee goes to get the bits* Any possible futures here where I'm hurt by this?
Garnet: *thinks pensively* Hmm... Mmm... Tons.
Steven: Uhh... Like... what?...
Garnet: Well, for starters...
(A Cartoon Steven appears to illustrate the possible deaths outcomes of Steven, while "Death Rag" plays in the background.)
Garnet: You could just be going on about your business, eating your fry bits, and then suddenly you choke to death!
(Cartoon Steven chokes on his fries bits, pops into a skeleton, and collapses.)
Garnet: Or you get so distracted that you fall down a manhole!
(A walking Cartoon Steven falls into a manhole, and a cartoon skull pops out from it.)
Garnet: You could get food poisoning, or be bullied by wasps.
(Cartoon Steven turns into a skeleton in a hospital bed, and then gets stung by wasps, inflating like a balloon and popping into a skeleton.)
Garnet: And that's just a few instances off the top of my head.
Steven: *starts sweating and takes the bag of fries bits from Peedee* W-What if I stand perfectly still?
Garnet: You'll probably get a really bad sunburn. *walks off* Yeah.
Steven: Uh, Garnet, wait up! *chases after Garnet*
(Steven starts imagining various ways he could be fatally injured on his way back to the Beach House, and "Death Rag" plays again. He first looks out to the beach: Cartoon Steven walks in when a shark emerges from the sea and chomps on him. The shark then spits out Cartoon Steven's skull on the sand.)
(A sweaty Steven then looks at the Big Donut: Cartoon Steven walks by the Big Donut, when the donut sign falls off and crushes Cartoon Steven, turning him into a skeleton.)
(Steven gets really worried and looks up to the sky: An alien UFO with an alien cat in it appears before Cartoon Steven.)
Cartoon Steven: Cookie Cat! You're real?! *gets zapped by Cookie CAt* Ah, no! I never considered that you would be evil!
(Cookie Cat kills Cartoon Steven with a laser beam from his UFO.)
(Steven gets really paranoid, sweating profusely and hyperventilating.)
[Trans. Int. Beach House]
(Steven stands in a daze behind the kitchen counter, wearing his bicycle helmet and holding ingredients for a sandwich.)
Garnet: Steven.
Steven: *startled* Aah!
Garnet: Nice helmet.
Steven: *chuckles and scoffs* Yeah... You- You never know... when... you're gonna... ride a bike!...
Garnet: ... And you're making a sandwich.
Steven: Yeah. Just gotta... pick up the knife... and... s-spread the mayonnaise. *clears throat* Pick up the- *whimpers* ...the knife! *struggles to reach for the knife* Pick up... kni-i-fe! *screams in panic and hyperventilates*
Garnet: Steven!
Steven: Wait! Wait! I've got it. *picks up the jar of mayonnaise and plops it all onto the sandwich*
Garnet: *smirks* That will kill you faster.
Steven: Not funny!
Garnet: Oh.
Amethyst: *runs in* Nice noggin, Steven. *laughs and steps onto the Warp Pad with Pearl*
Pearl: We're ready, Garnet.
Steven: Wait. You're going on a mission? *grabs Garnet's arm* Hold on! Don't leave me! *tears up* At least tell me what's gonna happen with my lunch! Do I choke on a pickle?
Garnet: Mm, you don't choke on a pickle.
Steven: *clutches Garnet's arm tighter* That means something else happens with the pickle!
Pearl: Garnet! Shouldn't we be going?
Garnet: *kneels down and places her hands on Steven's shoulders* Steven, I can't be with you all the time. Just trust me when I say that you are in control. *smiles at Steven, and he smiles back* Do not go on the roof! No matter what.
(Dramatic music plays, as Steven glares at Garnet in horror.
[Timeskip - Night time]
(It begins to rain heavily outside the Crystal Temple. Steven is alone, curled up by the windows in the dark beach house, as thunder crashes loudly outside. He then looks up to the ceiling.)
Steven: *whimpers* What could possibly happen to me on the roof?
(Thunder crashes again and the front door suddenly bursts open, startling Steven. He then runs forth and shuts it.)
Steven: *breathing heavily* Okay. Calm down. Maybe I should just get a snack. *gasps* But what if..!
(Cartoon Steven appears again along with the "Death Rag" music. He tries to open the fridge door and it falls over him. A live Cartoon Steven reappears and, by some unknown reasons, a chandelier falls over him, turning him into a skeleton. The wasps from before starts stinging Cartoon Steven again.)
Cartoon Steven: Ugh! How come you guys are back?!
Wasp 1
We're made of magic.
Wasp 2
Yeah! Magic!
(Cartoon Steven turns a skeleton again while both wasps laughs maniacally.)
(Steven screams in paranoid from his imaginations. Thunder clashes again, scaring Steven, and he runs away screaming, hides under the table and begins to cry.)
Steven: *sees his teddy bear nearby* Ugh! Master of Ceremonies Bear Bear. *reaches to picks it up*
(Steven looks at the teddy bear as Steven's words "I'm a big boy now!" echo in his head.)
Steven: What's happening to me? I'm supposed to be... a Crystal Gem. I'm supposed to be a Crystal Gem! (Thunder crashes.) AAAAAHHH! *punches the table off him and gets up* Ugh!
[Trans. Ext. Beach House]
(Steven climbs on top of the beach house and stands against the heavy rain, while thunder continues crashing loudly.)
Steven: *breathing heavily* Okay. I'm here. *standing on the roof* What are you gonna do to me, future?
(The inside of the house is then filled with light as someone warps back, and Garnet quickly races outside onto the porch.)
Garnet: Steven! Get off the roof!
Steven: No! If something is going to happen to me... Just let it happen.
Garnet: Steven! *gets worried* You don't understand.
Steven: No, you don't understand. *grabs his head in panic* Everything I do shoves me violently towards the end! The more I know, the more I know that I don't know! *kneels down with his hands raised into the air* I can't live like this! Why did you tell me about future vision?! What's going to happen to me on the roof?!
Garnet: ... This.
Steven: W-What?
Garnet: I knew you might do this if I told you about my power. I saw this, and I told you anyway.
Steven: But why?
Garnet: I took a risk at your expense. There was a chance you'd understand this, and we'd be closer. *takes off her visor, revealing her third eye* Steven, I see so many things that can hurt you. I should never have let one of them be me. *puts her visor back on* There are millions of possibilities for the future, but it's up to you to choose which becomes reality. Please understand. You choose your own future.
Steven: I do understand. I... (Thunder crashes, and Steven has an epiphany.) What am I doing?... I guess I can't really see a future for myself up here. *sighs, slides down the roof and runs towards Garnet to hug her* I'll watch out for myself from now on.
(Garnet looks up to the sky and raises her hand, blocking a lightning strike just in time and protecting Steven from it. Steven continues to hug Garnet unknowingly.)
Steven: What was that?
Garnet: Oh, nothing important.
(The star iris then zooms in on Steven and Garnet, ending the episode.)
