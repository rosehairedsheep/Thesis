[Open Int. Steven's Bathroom, Night-time]
(Steven is prepping himself for bed by brushing his teeth, cleaning his face and swabbing his ear. He then sits on the toilet, lifts up his pajamas shirt and wipes his gem. The clean gem reflects his face on it, and he gives himself a thumbs-up.)
[Trans' Int. Steven's Room]
(Steven dives into his bed and lays upright.)
Steven: Goodnight, Happy Bear. Goodnight, Sad Bunny. Goodnight, Playful Kitty. Goodnight, Ominous Triangle at the foot of my bed.
(Steven closes his eyes to sleep. He then opens his eyes again, and the Ominous Triangle has disappeared.)
Steven: Ugh, whatever. *closes his eyes and smiles*
(Peridot's hand then closes over Steven's mouth, causing him to scream-muffled and struggle.)
[Trans. Galaxy Warp]
(Peridot warps into the Galaxy Warp, carrying a struggling Steven.)
Steven: Aargh, let me go! *screams*
Peridot: Enough of this! *sighs*
(Peridot holds Steven with her tractor beam and hovers him over the Gem Homeworld Warp Pad.)
Steven: What do you want from me?
Peridot: *walking towards Homeworld Warp Pad* I want, to get off this lousy gem-forsaken planet!
Steven: Huh?
(Peridot disables her tractor beam and Steven falls to the ground.)
Peridot: *shapes her fingers into arrows and points them at the warp pad she and Steven are stepping on* You have to fix this!
Steven: Wait, what?
Peridot: You're my last chance. I've got no Flask Robonoids. I've got no foot! I've got no response from Yellow Diamond! *breathes in and out, calming herself down* I know you fixed Lazuli's gem. Whatever you did, you've got to do it to the Homeworld Warp! Or else!! *charges her energy blaster*
Steven: Oh, o-okay, just give me a second! My mouth gets really dry when I'm scared. *licks his palm* Here goes!
(Steven slaps his palm onto the warp pad with a wet smack sound. Peridot looks around in confusion as nothing happens.)
Peridot: What was that?! It didn't do ANYTHING!
Steven: *hesitantly* It... doesn't always work.
Peridot: No... *shaking head in exasperation* No no no no no! It HAS to work!
Steven: I'm really sorry...
Peridot: *laughs and curls up on the ground, looking plaintively* This was it... This was my last shot! *gasps* I'm gonna die here! Noooooh, oh-
Steven: Hey, hey- come on! Earth isn't that bad...
Peridot: It doesn't matter what Earth is like! It's not going to be like anything soon! *pulls on her face in panic*
Steven: What do you mean?
(The Crystal Gems then warp in.)
Peridot: Uuuuuugh!! *runs away from Steven*
Pearl: There he is! *runs towards Steven, with Garnet and Amethyst, and hugs him*
Steven: Guys!
Pearl: What happened?!
Amethyst: Ahh, you're okay!
Garnet: Peridot!
Peridot: Why can't you just leave me alone?!?!
Garnet: *cracks her knuckles with her gauntlets* Gems! Move! *charges forth*
Peridot: Kyaah!
(Peridot shoots three energy blasts in quick succession at the Gems, who dodges out of the way, and tries to fly away with  her helicopter fingers. Amethyst swiftly tethers Peridot with her whip, and Peridot laughs as she generates and sends a electric current down the whip. Garnet then grabs the whip and stops the electric current.)
Garnet: Not this time!
(Garnet sends the electric current back at Peridot, electrifying her, and whips her slamming down to the ground screaming. shocking Peridot, as a concerned Steven watches and gasps. Peridot coughs as she gets up, and backs off as Garnet and Pearl approach her.)
Peridot: Wait, wait.. you- you need me!!
(Peridot aims her energy blaster at Garnet, as Pearl sneaks up behind her, drawing her spear.)
Peridot: I'm, the only one who knows ABOUT THE-
(Peridot notices Pearl and turns towards her, ready to fire her blaster, when Garnet grabs and squeezes her, effectively poofing her. Peridot's disembodied limbs then fall to the ground, as the Crystal Gems gather around to observe.)
Pearl: What on Earth?
Amethyst: Ughh, sick, there's bits of her all over.
Garnet: Nope, she's right here. *bubbles Peridot's gem and sends it off* And now she's in the temple.
Pearl: *picks up a piece to inspect* So these weren't actually part of her body?
Amethyst: *snatches Pearl's piece, scoops up the rest and drops them all into the ocean, making it looks like an accident* Uhh whoops.
Steven: Garnet, she was trying to tell us something...
Garnet: Those were just the desperate lies of a Gem who's been caught. You don't need to worry about her anymore. *walks off*
Pearl: Come on, Steven. *pushes Steven along* Oh, I'm so glad this is finally over.
[Trans. Int. Steven's Room]
(Steven in back in his bedroom, holding onto Peridot's detached foot, as he sighs deeply. He curls up to to ponder with concerns, when Amethyst suddenly appears and slaps his face.)
Amethyst: I'm back to kidnap you! What? *chuckles* It's been long enough that we can joke about it, right?
Steven: It's only been, like, an hour.
Amethyst: So- Ew, what are you doing with her foot?
Steven: ... Think it's lucky?
Amethyst: Not for Peridot! *laughs and hugs Steven* Well, glad to have you back. *walks off*
Steven: Um, Amethyst?
Amethyst: Yeah?
Steven: Uh, do you think... No, it's okay. Never mind.
Amethyst: Okay, weirdo. If you need anything, I'll be in my room eating garbage. *leaves*
Steven: 'Kay.
(Amethyst returns back into her room, and Steven flops backwards onto his bed, sighing deeply again.)
Steven: Why were you so scared? What were you going to say? Now you're deep in the temple in a bubble and I'll never know. If I could just talk to you for one more second...
(Steven's gem then starts glowing and the Temple Gate opens.)
[Trans. Int. Rose's Room]
(Steven runs into his mother's room.)
Steven: Room, I need to talk to Peridot.
("Peridot" is then formed from clouds.)
Cloud Peridot: I'm the only one who knows ABOUT THE-
(Cloud Peridot just freezes in place.)
Steven: The what? Ugh, no no no. *swipes at the Cloud Peridot and dissipates it* Room, I need to go to the basement. The real basement! I know there's a way down from here!
(The clouds in front of Steven part away, revealing one of the Crystal Heart's veins to the Burning Room.)
Steven: Thank you!
(Steven hops onto the vein and slides down.)
Steven: Woo! Yeah! *flies off the vein and starts somersaulting* Triple 550 Deluxe with no cheese! Ugh!
(Steven lands on his face and gets up with a slight limp.)
Steven: *strained* Yep, perfect landing..
[Trans. Int. Burning Room]
(Steven begins looking at the array of bubbled Gems and spots Peridot's gem.)
Steven: Hmm. There we go! *climbs up the vein towards Peridot's gem* Gotcha! Whoa!
(Steven falls off of the vein onto the floor, accidentally letting go of the bubble and it pops. The gem then levitates into the air and Peridot regenerates.)
Peridot: -THE CLUSTER, you insufferable half-formed traitor MEGA-CLODS!!!
(Peridot aims her arm at Steven, but quickly realized her blaster is missing, as she wiggles her fingers around.)
Steven: *with puppy eyes* Oh my gosh... you're so... cuuuuute! *approaches Peridot, who is now shorter than usual*
Peridot: My limb enhancers! Where are my limb enhancers?! *inspects her whole body*
Steven: Aw, you're like.. an angry little slice of pie!
Peridot: Stop talking! I demand to know what this place is, and where I- *looks up and sees the array of other bubbled Gems* Oh my stars... You're going to harvest me?!
Steven: No! I mean... (Peridot slaps him in panic.) Ow, that hurt!
Peridot: ... It did?
Steven: Yeah, a lot. (Peridot slaps him again.) Ow!
Peridot: Yes! Feel my unbridled rage! *begins slapping Steven repeatedly*
Steven: Hey! *grabs Peridot's hands* Hey, hey. What's that on your shirt? *points down at Peridot's chest*
Peridot: What's a shirt? (Steven flicks his finger up at her nose.) Ow! That's it!
(Peridot tackles Steven and slaps him over and over again.)
Steven: Why are you acting like this!?
Peridot: You smashed me into a limbless cloud! You trapped me in your bubble dungeon! And, you called me... *sniffs and blushes angrily* cute! *tries to punch Steven, but misses*
Steven: I didn't poof you! I freed you!
Peridot: *faces Steven and curls up* ... Why would you make such a miscalculation?
Steven: Back at the Warp Pad, what were you trying to say? Why do we need you? What do you know?
Peridot: What do I know? Everything there is to know about the Cluster, you pebble.
Steven: Cluster? Wait, "pebble"?
Peridot: My mission. The reason why I'm on this sad rock in the first place! I was to check progress on the Cluster! Just in and out, before it hatches. I wasn't supposed to get stuck here! But now it's going to emerge and nothing can stop it, and we'll all be shattered! *panics*
Steven: Okay, okay, wait, slow down. Now, from the top... *sits down in front of Peridot* Emerging, hatching, Clusters.
Peridot: You wanna know?
Steven: Yes.
Peridot: You really wanna know?
Steven: Yes?
Peridot: What's your shirt? *points to Steven's shirt*
Steven: These are my banana pajamas- (Peridot flicks his nose and runs off.) OW! Wait, don't run away!
(Peridot begins climbing out of the Burning Room, laughing maniacally as she exits, and Steven chases after her.)
[Trans Int. Beach House]
(Peridot runs out of the Temple Gate laughing manically, followed by Steven.)
Steven: Stop! They're gonna see you!
Peridot: *spreads her arms out wide* Freedom is MINE!
(Peridot pauses and slowly turns her head, seeing Pearl, Garnet, and Amethyst glaring at her at the kitchen table.)
Steven: *runs in between the Gems and Peridot* Wait!
Peridot: *stuttering while pointing to the ceiling* Look! Over there! Another planet to betray!
(Pearl grunts, Garnet summons her gauntlets and Amethyst eats a whole pizza box in one gulp.)
Peridot: *shaking in fear* Retreat!
(Peridot crawls to the front door, but Pearl and Garnet block her path.)
Pearl: Oh no, you don't!
Peridot: Eeep!!
(Peridot scampers up the steps, where Amethyst is waiting on Steven's bed.)
Amethyst: *pulling her whip* Heey.
Peridot: AAAHH! *jumps back down to the ground floor* Ow!
Garnet: Get her!
(Peridot scampers into the bathroom and shuts the door.)
Peridot: You may have won the war, but the battle isn't over, CRYSTAL CLODS! *laughs*
(The Gems then dispels their weapons.)
Pearl: Should we tell her that's the bathroom?
Amethyst: Ehh.
[Trans. Int. Steven's Bathroom]
Peridot: *looking around* Hmm... Seems I discovered some sort of archaic... think-chamber. Roomy, with a fresh hint of Earth citrus. *opens the toilet lid* A perfect crossroads for my escape.
[Trans. Ext. Steven's Bathroom]
Amethyst: *tries to turn the doorknob* It's locked.
Garnet: Peridot, open the door!
(Toilet flushing is heard.)
Amethyst: If you're trying to flush yourself down the toilet, it won't work.
(Peridot is seen swirling in the toilet.)
Amethyst: Trust me, I've tried.
Pearl: How did she get out? We bubbled her!
Amethyst: Maybe we needed a bigger bubble.
Garnet: My bubbles are fine.
Steven: *sweating anxiously* ... I did it.
(Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl glare at Steven in shock and anger.)
Pearl: Steven! Why would you do such a thing!?
Steven: Because she knows something! Something that's made her scared!
Amethyst: *punches into her palm* Duh. Homegirl knows we're gonna beat her into a green pancake.
Steven: No, not 'cause of us. 'Cause of something called "the Cluster".
Garnet: Cluster? That's new. *crosses her arms*
Pearl: What else did she tell you?
Steven: That's all I got.
Peridot: That's right, you dirt bombs! You don't even know what's coming!!! *notices the mirror* Ooh..
Garnet: I'm tired of playing these games.
(Peridot is seen making faces in the mirror.)
Garnet: If we can't fight her, then fine. We'll talk. Peridot!
Peridot: Whoa! *slips off the sink*
Garnet: Alright, no more fighting. Let's just have a civil conversation.
Peridot: As if I'd negotiate with you, filthy war machine!
Garnet: *summons her gauntlets angrily* Okay, let's kick her butt.
Steven: Wait!
Peridot: *holds a plunger while hanging from the shower curtains* Yeah! Destroy me again, and have fun trying to talk to me when I'm in a bubble! *quickly covers her mouth while clinging to the shower curtains, regretting what she said*
Pearl: I really hate to say it, but unfortunately if she has information, she's more valuable to us like... this.
Garnet: This is going to be tricky.
(Water gushing is then heard.)
Peridot: H-h-hot hot hot!
Steven: You have to turn the knob the other way for cold!
[Trans. Kitchen]
(The Crystal Gems then gather in the kitchen to discuss, while Steven drinks from a cup.)
Steven: Wait, so we're just gonna let her live in my bathroom?
Pearl: Well, yes. What other option do we have? Keep her outside on a leash? *laughs* Ha ha... *ponders* Hmm...
Steven: But, I need to use the bathroom!
Pearl: Right now?
Steven: Yeah, kinda.
Amethyst: Just go in the ocean, bro. Pssssh. Like a feeyush.
Steven: What's with you guys and making me pee outside!? *storms off*
Amethyst: Well I have fun doing it..
[Time Skip — Dawn]
(The Gems are still discussing in the background in the kitchen, while a half-awake Steven, carrying Peridot's prosthetic foot, walks past.)
Pearl: But even if we do get her to come out of the bathroom...
Amethyst: She's never gonna talk to us.
Garnet: Looks like there's not much else we can do right now.
Pearl: We have her in our custody at least, even if the circumstances are less than optimal. How important do you think this Cluster is?
Garnet: If it has anything to do with the experiments she was conducting in the Kindergarten, then very.
Steven: *knocks on the bathroom door* Peridot, can I come in? I need to get ready for the day.
Peridot: No!
Steven: I have something for you.
(Peridot cracks the door open to see Steven holding her foot. She grabs it and shuts the door, then slowly opens the door again for Steven.)
[Trans. Int. Steven's Bathroom]
(Steven enters the bathroom and turns on the lights, seeing Peridot clinging to her prosthetic foot in a corner.)
Peridot: What a great souvenir of that other time you assaulted me.
Steven: Oh, right, sorry. I can take it back.
Peridot: No, it's too late! You... wouldn't happen to have the rest?
Steven: *washing his face* Uh, sorry, we lost them. *pauses* Well, we kinda threw 'em away. *points to the toothbrush on the floor* Can you pass me that?
Peridot: *picks up Steven's toothbrush* Is this a weapon!?
Steven: Only for cavities.
Peridot: Hmm. *tosses the toothbrush to Steven*
Steven: Thanks! *begins brushing his teeth*
Peridot: *looking around Steven at the sink* Is that a weapon?
Steven: No, that's a comb I never use.
Peridot: *climbs onto the toilet* Is that a weapon?
Steven: Hmm? Oh, well, I guess if you get it wet and roll it up. *rolls up his towel, and Peridot flinches in fear* Look, I know you're scared, but I'm not going to hurt you. And whatever's going on, whatever the "Cluster" is, I wanna help.
Peridot: I doubt you can help me, but I... appreciate the offer.
Steven: *smiles* Now do you mind moving? *points at the toilet* I have to use that.
(The star iris closes in on Peridot's face.)
Peridot: ... For what?
(The iris closes, ending the episode.)
