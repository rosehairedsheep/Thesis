[Open Int. Beach House]
(Steven is drawing a flyer of Greg as "Guitar Dad" in his room with a pencil, and then making the final touches with a red marker.)
Steven: *picks up the drawing and runs down the steps* PEARL! AMETHYST! GARNET! Uh-ah!
(Steven finds all the Gems are sitting on the couch in the living room.)
Pearl: *reading a magazine* You don't have to yell, Steven, we're right here.
Steven: I know, but I just finished this drawing, and I wanted to show it to you.
Pearl: Oh! Uh... Of course.
Steven: All right! *jumps on Garnet's lap and shows the Gems his flyer* Haha! "Guitar Dad teaches you guitar!"
Amethyst: What is that?
Steven: It's my dad. He's going to start teaching guitar lessons and he made me his P.R. Department.
Amethyst: *points at some crosses on Greg's mouth* What's that stuff in his mouth?
Steven: Those are his teeth.
Pearl: What are the lightning bolts for?
Steven: Ugh... Well, ah... I was trying to show that Dad really rocks on the guitar, and...
Garnet: *points at the flyer* Then there should be rocks falling out of the guitar.
Steven: I hear what you're saying, but it's too late for notes... this is permanent marker.
[Trans. Int. Big Donut]
(Steven tapes the flyer on the billboard inside the Big Donut.)
Sadie: What's that cute flyer for, Steven?
Steven: It's for my dad, he'll teach you guitar, you guys wanna sign up? My dad's really good.
Sadie: Maybe I'll stop by and check it out.
Steven: Here, lemme give you a flyer and—
(The door bell chimes and Buck enters.)
Sadie: Welcome to the Big Donut.
Steven: Hey, Buck.
Lars: *surprised* Oh! W-what? *flaps his arms like a chicken* Buck, Buck, Buuuuuuuuck! Haha! *takes off his headphones* What's going on man? What can we get for you today?
Buck: *looks at the menu, then at the donuts* Can I get a caprese salad?
Sadie: Oh sorry, Buck. We only serve don-
Lars: *barges in* DO-NUT worry, Buck! I'll whip ya up a salad, no sweat! *makes a thumb-up, sweating* I'll be right back. *runs into the break room*
Sadie: Lars! We don't even have vegetables here! *runs after Lars*
Buck: *looks at Steven's flyer* Heh, what's a "guitar dad"?
Steven: Like my flyer? It's for my dad. *pretends to play a guitar* He'll teach you guitar! Here, take one of these with you. Actually, just wear it. *tapes a flyer onto Buck's shirt*
(Buck starts laughing uncontrollably.)
Steven: Are you ticklish?
Buck: This would make a rad shirt, man.
Steven: Really?
Buck: Yeah, let's make your flyer into T-shirts.
Steven: Oh man, my dad would love that!
Buck: Gimme five on it. *holds out his hand*
(Steven swings his hand too hard and misses Buck's hand.)
Buck: Oh, you missed.
[Trans. Int. Abandoned Warehouse]
(Steven and Buck meet up with Mayor Dewey, who is unloading several boxes of campaign supplies from his van in the warehouse.)
Mayor Dewey: Ho! I think it's swell you're returning to the family business, son. Gonna help the old man get re-elected again, eh? *hugs Buck and pats his head* Aww, son!
Buck: *breaks free* Ugh! It's not for campaign stuff, dad. Steven and I are making art.
Steven: *gasps* Art!
Mayor Dewey: Art, huh? I don't understand it myself, but a boy's gotta have interests and ambitions. *slaps Buck hard on the back, causing his visor to fall off* WOAH-HO-HO-HO!
Steven: *looks around at the supplies and equipment* This stuff can be used to make t-shirts?
Mayor Dewey: Oh yeah, I've got all the latest, state of the art screen-printing equipment from years of campaigning. And other some such, mayorly things. Like this week, I'm commemorating... a bench!
(Mayor Dewey shows the boys a banner of "Bench City", which is just a banner that reads "Welcome to Beach City", with a "N" written onto the "A" with a marker.)
Steven: "Welcome to... Bench City"? Thrifty!
Buck: *moans* Dad, you can't use this.
Mayor Dewey: Why not? You know I "gotta gank dat youth vote, boi"! *tries to do cool poses*
Buck: Dad, stop.
(Steven goes to open one of the boxes and finds several flyers, similar to Steven's. He takes one out and it reads "Vote for My Dad" with a drawing of Buck and Mayor Dewey holding hands.)
Steven: What's this?
Mayor Dewey: What have you got there? *takes the flyer* Aww... I haven't seen this in years. Remember when you drew this, Buck? You couldn't wait to show it off to all your li'l Montessori friends.
Buck: Okay, dad. Thanks for all your help, see ya later, bye. *starts pushing Mayor Dewey out*
Mayor Dewey: Alright, kids. I mean... "Peace in the Middle-East, Holmes."
Steven: *picks up another one of Buck's flyers* So cool.
Buck: *quickly grabs and crumples the flyer* Let's just get started already.
(Buck and Steven proceed to make multiple copies of T-shirts using the equipment Mayor Dewey provided, with Steven's "Guitar Dad" flyer printed on the T-shirts.)
Buck: *admires one of the T-shirts* Swag.
Steven: Now everyone's gonna want lessons from Dad!
Buck: This is bigger than your dad, Steven. It's art. And it's gonna flood the public consciousness. *his visor sparkles*
Steven: Let's start handing them out.
Buck: Too simple. We need to get controversial. We need to create boom— a scene.
[Trans. Funland Arcade's Rooftop]
(Steven is looking for victims to shoot their T-shirts at, through his binoculars, as Buck readies the T-Shirt Cannon.)
Steven: Scanning for targets, T-Shirt Cannon loaded and ready. Beep, beep, beep-bibibibibi! *points at Sour Cream* Sour Cream sighted!
Sour Cream: *using his phone* Wom, wom. Wom, wom, wom.
Steven: Get ready... Take aim.
Buck: Aaand... *shoots the cannon*
Sour Cream: Wom, wom, wom- WOMP! *gets hit in the head by the T-shirt* What in the world? *picks up and examines the T-shirt* Oh. This is the coolest thing I've ever been hit in the head with!
Steven: Ronaldo spotted, take aim!
(Buck fires another T-shirt and it knocks Ronaldo's fedora off of his head.)
Ronaldo: WHOA! What the heck? Huh? *picks up the T-shirt* Whoa, weird! Some kind of extraterrestrial space dad guitar shirt? Sooo... You've finally decided to make first contact, huh? WHERE ARE YOU?!
Steven: Lars sighted, take aim!
(Buck fires another T-shirt at Lars' head.)
Lars: YEOWCH! What the—?! *picks up the T-shirt* What is this garbage? *looks up and see Buck and Steven* Buck made this?! *starts laughing aloud* This is hilarious! Thaaanks Buuuck!
[Trans. Int. Fish Stew Pizza ]
(Steven and Buck decide to take a break and eat pizzas together.)
Steven: Cheers! *chomps his pizza slice* Buck, this was such a good idea! I don't know why we didn't collaborate on a project sooner. This'll make my dad so happy. I can't wait to see the look on his face when I stop by later.
Buck: *eating his pizza slice* Yeah... should be good for a laugh.
Steven: Huh? Why would it be good for—
Jenny: *enters Fish Stew Pizza, wearing the "Guitar Dad" T-shirt* Giiiirl! Check out my new shiiiiirt!
Kiki: It's really cute. Where'd you get it?
Jenny: I dunno, it just landed in front of me when I was out walking.
Kiki: Well, if I were you, I wouldn't wear some random shirt that just fell out of the sky. What if there were bugs in it?
Jenny: Re-lax! Who cares where it came from? This shirt is the funniest thing I've seen in my life!
Buck: Looks like our shirt has a really good buzz goin'.
Steven: Yeah, but... I think they think it's a joke.
Buck: Heh. The only thing that's important is that they're talking about it. That's how real art works.
Steven: Oh. Well, I guess you're right.
[Trans. Ext. It's A Wash]
(Steven visits his Dad and sees Sour Cream taking a picture of Greg.)
Greg: Uh... how's this? *poses*
Sour Cream: Haha, so bad. *takes picture*
Greg: Okay, let's get started with the first lesson! Have a seat and grab a— (Sour Cream walks off.) Where ya goin'? Oh, uh, I guess he's got an important text or something.
Steven: How's it been going today?
Greg: Really great! Lots of people have been coming by thanks to your t-shirts, little guy.
Steven: That's great, Dad. I'm really glad I can help...
Jenny: Yoohoo! Guitar Dad! *drives by* I just wanted to say I think you're wonderful and hilarious! *drives off*
Greg: Uh... thank you? Huh, that's kinda strange.
Steven: What is?
Greg: Well, lots of people have stopped by, but no one's taken a lesson yet.
Steven: *surprised* What?! Really?!
Greg: Ah, maybe they're just checking out the scene before they come back to get a REAL lesson. *starts playing his guitar*
[Trans. Int. Abandoned Warehouse]
(Buck is printing more "Guitar Dad" T-shirts in the warehouse.)
Steven: Buck! *runs in*
Buck: Hey, there's my main man.
Steven: The shirts aren't working, Buck!
Buck: Yeah they are, *picks up a t-shirt* people love' em.
Steven: But... nobody wants guitar lessons from my dad!
Buck: That's not the point.
Steven: What?! Then, what is the point?
Buck: The point is, it's an amazing shirt.
Steven: *blushes* Aww, my drawing's not that good, ahaha.
Buck: Yeah, no. It's terrible.
Steven: What?!
Buck: That's what's so great about it. Your work is so naive. You really love your dad. It's funny.
Steven: I... I don't wanna make these shirts anymore.
Buck: Too bad, Steven, it's so current, you can't stop it. I'm a taste maker, and I'm gonna keep making tastes... forever.
Steven: "Forever"? *gets nervous*
Buck: Well, forever after I go to my dad's lame bench commemoration... peace. *holds a peace sign above his head and walks away*
[Trans. Int. Beach House]
(Steven runs back to his house and bursts through the door.)
Steven: Garnet! Pearl! Amethyst!
(All the Gems stand up in high alert.)
Garnet: Steven.
Pearl: What is it?!
Amethyst: Whoa, where's the fire?!
Steven: It's an emergency! You have to help me get rid of all the shirts and stop Buck from making more!
Pearl: Have the shirts come to life and possessed the bodies of their wearers?!
Steven: No! They just-
Amethyst: Are people catching on fire when they put on the magic shirts?
Steven: No, no, they're just-
Pearl: *spewing saliva while speaking in panic* Are the shirts destroying the wearer's will to continue on in this mortal coil, thereby shutting down BEACH CITY?!?
Steven: NO!! They're... *sighs* They're just... using my art in a way I don't agree with.
Pearl: Oh.
(All the Gems sit back down on the couch.)
Garnet: *adjusts her visor* Eh, we'll pass.
Steven: What?! But... But I really need your help.
Pearl: Steven, this sounds like a very abstract problem.
Amethyst: It's not something we can punch. *punches her own palm*
Garnet: You must learn to help yourself. That's how you become stronger. *her visor sparkles*
Amethyst: Good point, good point. *nods*
Pearl: Absolutely.
Steven: But...!
Amethyst: *starts getting annoyed* Figure something OUT, Steven!
Pearl: Yes! Why not dust off those conflict resolution skills?
Garnet: Let your problem be known. Then you can work towards an understanding.
Steven: *thinks of an idea and speaks eerily* Oh, I'll make them understand. *walks out* I'll make them all understand!
(The Gems are mildly surprised.)
Amethyst: Eh, he'll be fine.
[Trans. Beach City Boardwalk]
(Several citizens are gathered around Mayor Dewey near a bench.)
Mayor Dewey: Okay, is everyone here? *blushes and clears his throat* Hello! I was supposed to write a speech to uhm... *adjusts his neck tie* Uh... commemorate this... uh... new bench! But what had happened was I ran out of printer ink in my printer, that I keep at home!
(Steven, wearing sunglasses, appears on the roof of the Funland Arcade. He opens a guitar case and takes out a T-Shirt Cannon. He loads it and takes aim towards Mayor Dewey like a sniper.)
Mayor Dewey: So, I went to the store and wouldn't you know it? They didn't carry the brand I was looking for, so-
Steven: *whispering* Bye.
Mayor Dewey: -I called up a buddy of mine who owed me a...
(Everything turns into slow motion as Steven fires a T-shirt at Mayor Dewey.)
Mayor Dewey (Slow motion)
...few political favors, and he wasn't home!
Bodyguard #1 (Slow motion)
*spots the T-shirt projectile* Look out! *drops his sandwich and runs away*
Mayor Dewey (Slow motion)
No!
Bodyguard #2 (Slow motion)
Aaaah! *runs away*
(Mayor Dewey gets hit in the chest by the T-shirt and falls backwards onto the bench. Everything returns back to normal speed, as the crowd goes wild and runs in several directions.)
Mayor Dewey: I've been... shirt.
(Steven fires more T-shirts into the crowd. Buck sees everyone running and picks up a T-shirt, noticing that they all have his "Vote for My Dad" drawing printed on them. Steven then slowly backs away into the shadows, smiling.)
Mayor Dewey: Buck... *looking at a T-shirt, feeling touched* Did you make this?
(Buck is speechless. He looks over and sees Sour Cream and Jenny looking at the T-shirts too.)
Jenny: Ahahaha! This shirt is genius! *laughs with Sour Cream* This is way funnier than "Guitar Dad"!
Lars: Ahahahahahaha, ohoho! *holds a T-shirt, laughing aloud*
Mayor Dewey: *stops blushing and looks at the T-shirt* This bench is actually pretty comfortable.
(Buck sheds a tear under his visor.)
[Trans. It's A Wash]
(Steven meets up with Greg again at his car wash.)
Steven: Anyone else stop by for lessons today?
Greg: So far, no, but I'm sure it'll pick up tomorrow.
Steven: Yeah! I'm sure it will. *hands Greg a T-shirt* Oh, this is for you by the way. This is the last one so it's super limited edition.
Greg: Aw, sweet! Thanks, Steven.
(Steven smiles.)
Buck: Yo, Steven. *walks in* Just wanted to say uh... I'm sorry for what I did, and... uh...
Steven: It's okay, Buck. You don't have to say any more than that.
Buck: You're a cool cat, Steven Universe. *turns to Greg* Hey, Mr. U.
Greg: You wanna take a picture with me or some junk?
Buck: No way man. I want a lesson... from Guitar Dad!
(Buck lifts up his jacket and reveals a "Guitar Dad" shirt he is wearing. The star iris then zooms in on Buck's shirt, ending the episode.)
