[Open Ext. It's a Wash]
(Greg is washing a van modeled in the image of Mayor Dewey with Steven.)
Greg: Almost done! *sprays the van with a hose* Steven, get the hubcaps!
Steven: Hubbing it up! *rubs the van's hubcaps vigorously*
Greg: Hub it good! This is a high-profile job.
Steven: You mean cause it's the mayor's election-mobile?
Greg: If we do this right, we might get political favors!
Steven: I'm not sure what that is... but I like it! *grabs a nearby hose*
(Steven turns on the hose to spray the van, but the water arches over the van and splashes onto Greg by mistake. Greg laughs and sprays back at Steven with his hose, starting a water fight. Mayor Dewey then walks in towards them.)
Mayor Dewey: Hey, hey, hey! I'm not paying for father-son bonding here! (Steven sprays him with his hose.) UNIVERSE! Control that kid. *tries to wipe the water off himself*
Greg: Steven! *holds Steven close to him* Hehe, I'm sorry, Mayor Dewey. Hehehe, this one's on the house.
Mayor Dewey: *examining his van* On the house, eh? I like the way you do business, Universe.
(Mayor Dewey gets into the van and drives off, with a siren chanting "Mayor Dewey". Greg sighs in dismay.)
Steven: *wiggles his fingers* Political favors!
Greg: Ahh, you rascal! *picks Steven up and noogies him* Enough with the hose fights!
Steven: Aw, okay.
(Steven and Greg are suddenly splashed by some water.)
Greg: What the?
(Steven and Greg notices a purple cat holding a running hose in its mouth.)
Steven and Greg: Woah!
(The purple cat starts chasing them around, continuously spraying them with the hose.)
Greg: What is with this cat?!
(The purple cat begins to shapeshift, revealing to be Amethyst.)
Amethyst: Haha! Got you guys!
Steven: Amethyst!
Greg: Uh, pretty cool, Amethyst.
Steven: Really cool! I wish I could shapeshift like you!
Amethyst: *ties hose into a knot* You could probably learn.
Steven: Really?
Amethyst: Sure. *lifts up Steven's shirt* You've got a gem.
Greg: Whup! Magic stuff! Should I get out of here? Is there going to be an explosion?
Steven: Aw, it's no big deal, dad. *pulls his shirt down*
Amethyst: *shapeshifts into Steven* Yeah, it's fiinnneeee.
Greg: Gah!
[Trans. Int. Beach House]
Amethyst: Hey Pearl. *shapeshifts into a seal, * Arp, arp!
Steven: *laughing* Do more!
Amethyst: Check it out. *shapeshifts into a wolf, while Pearl stares blankly* Aawwooo! *shapeshifts into a wrestler* Raaa! *shapeshifts into a jay* Gaah! *perches on Steven's head*
Steven: Whoa!
Pearl: *walks over* Amethyst, you're overdoing it.
Amethyst: Uh, chill-it dude.
Pearl: Just because you can shapeshift, doesn't mean you should.
Steven: Can you shapeshift?
Amethyst: *shapeshifts into Pearl and interrupts Pearl* Well of course I can, I'm perfect! *smacking her butt* WOMP! WOMP!
(Pearl shoves Amethyst to the side and Amethyst tumbles away laughing.)
Pearl: All Gems have shapeshifting powers, Steven. *projects some holograms* We can turn into objects, we can change parts of our bodies or... we could do that. *looks at Amethyst*
Amethyst: *still smacking her butt* WOMP! WOMP!
Steven: I want to try it all!
Pearl: Don't bite off more than you can chew, Steven.
Amethyst: WOMP, WOMP!
Pearl: Ugh! *leaves through the front door, and Amethyst shapeshifts back into herself*
Steven: Alright! Show me how to change into a, uh, huge lion!
Amethyst: Actually, for once Pearl is right. If you're gonna do this, you've gotta start with something easy.
Steven: Like that cat you turned into?
Amethyst: That sounds good. Now follow my lead. *begins demonstrating for Steven* First, think of what you wanna be, and then, just shake it out. *shapeshifts into the cat* See? Haha! Now your turn.
Steven: Okay. *take a deep breath and starts straining himself* Caaatttt.....!
Amethyst: Nah, you're too tense. *opens a bag of chips* Just relax and feel it. *eats a potato chip* Bio-rhythms, yo.
Steven: *presses fingertips against his temples* Feeeelll iittt.....
Amethyst: Ehh, if you're not ready, we can try later.
Steven: No, wait! I can do it. (Amethyst shapeshifts back into herself and Steven starts "feeling it".) Yeah... yeah... HUH!
Amethyst: Well, it was a good try.
(A meowing noise appears out of nowhere. Steven opens his palm to see his index finger has turned into a head of a cat, meowing away. Amethyst starts giggling.)
Steven: This is so cool!
Amethyst: You should go show your dad. He's gonna FREAK OUT!
Cat Finger: Rreow!
[Trans. Ext. It's a Wash]
Steven: Dad, I'm back!
Greg: *is suntanning outside* Hey, schtu-ball.
Steven: Check it out!
(Steven shows the cat finger to his dad. Greg reacts in shock, hurling a water bottle which hits Steven on the head. Water splashes from the bottle onto the cat finger and it cowers, as if it got burned.)
Steven: I shapeshifted my finger into a cat!
Greg: Whoa! Is, is that a thing you can do now? That's pretty... cool.
Steven: I know, right! I'm gonna take this show on the road! *starts laughing and twirls away*
Cat Finger: Meow! Row! Reaw!
[Trans. Int. Big Donut]
Sadie: That'll be a dollar 'o five Steven.
Steven: Mm, okay. Here's a nickel. And a buck! *hold up the cat finger, holding a dollar bill in its mouth*
Sadie and Lars: Whaaat?!
(The cat finger drops the dollar bill and meows.)
Sadie: Oh Steven, that's adorable! *pets the cat finger with her finger, making it purr* Are... you making it purr?
Steven: It kinda does what it wants.
Lars: Really? *roughly pokes the cat finger, and it bites him* YOW!
Steven: See what I mean? "Bad cat finger!"
Sadie: Oh, I'm sure it just wants to play.
Steven: *gasps* You're right! And he doesn't have any friends.
Lars: *mockingly* Oh my gosh. It's just like you, Steven.
(Steven takes a deep breath, sways a bit and conjures four more cat fingers on the same palm.)
Steven: Huh haa! *holds his hand up high*
Cat Fingers: Rraaooow!
[Trans. Ext. Beach Citywalk Fries]
Steven: *hiding his cat fingers behind his back* Hey, Peedee! Whoa, you work the deep-fryer now? *slams his fist on the counter* Make me some fry bits!
Peedee: Steven, I take my job seriously, please use the actual menu.
Steven: Give me the bits! *slams his fist again* The BITS!-
Mr. Fryman: Alright listen, it'll be over sooner if you just give him what he wants. (Peedee sighs and walks away.)
Steven: Whoa, hey, hey, it's not for me. It's fo' these guys! *holds up the cat fingers, meowing away*
Mr. Fryman: What the?!
Peedee: Uh, here's your... *looks at the cat fingers* ... bits.
(Steven dunks the cat fingers into the fry bits, and they start to eat.)
Mr. Fryman: I can't look away.
Peedee: Steven, that is freakish.
Steven: No it's not. It's natural. *starts to sway his other arm* Sha-ake... it... out! (All the fingers on his other hand turn into cats.) See! *dunks the other hand into the bits*
Peedee and Mr. Fryman: Whoa!
Mr. Fryman: You know who would love this? Your older brother. Yo Ronaldo!
Ronaldo: What's up daa... *notices Steven, start gasping and shoves Peedee out of the way* I've gotta take a pic for Keep Beach City Weird! *takes out his phone and snaps a picture of Steven and his cat fingers*
Steven: What's that?
Ronaldo: It's my blog. *dramatically* Keep! Beach! City! Weird! (Peedee groans.)
Steven: Can I see the picture? (Steven takes the phone and the cats whine in agony.) YIKES! *drops phone* Sorry guys. I guess cat fingers don't function well as... fingers.
[Trans. Int. Steven's House]
Steven: *struggles to open the fridge* Tsk, I'm just getting a snack! (Steven tries to pull a sandwich out, as the cat fingers start whining.)
Amethyst: Steven! Need some help?
Steven: *holding the sandwich with his elbows* Nah, i-it's cool.
Amethyst: Oh gooood! See ya later then.
Steven: Huh?
Amethyst: We're taking the Gem Sloop out to sea to fight a living island.
Steven: What? *drops the sandwich* Uh, Amethyst, wait!
[Trans. Ext. Steven's House]
Steven: I wanna go on the Gem Sloop! I wanna see a living island! *runs down stairs and to the dock* Wait! Wait, wait!
(Steven runs into the water to catch up to the Gems sailing away on the Gem Sloop.)
Pearl: Steven!
Amethyst: *laughs* C'mon, you can make it!
(Steven dunks his hands into the water to swim, but the cat fingers start meowing in agitation. The Gems gasp.)
Pearl: Steven, what's going on?
Steven: Waah! I-it's nothing! I-i just turned all my fingers into cats!
Amethyst: *snorts*
Pearl: We have to stay and help Steven!
Garnet: We can't. This is a tectonic emergency. We'll deal with Steven when we get back.
Pearl: Amethyst, I blame YOU- for this.
Amethyst: Eh, that's fair.
Pearl: GRRR!! Steven, just, try to stay calm!
[Trans. Int. Beach House]
Steven: Enough! No more cat fingers! I want Steven fingers! ...And I don't mean little me heads on fingers, I mean my regular fingers! (Steven breathes in and a spot on his head turns into a cat. He collapses onto the floor, and his whole arm turns into a cat.) Wha! Aahhh! Stop! (His foot turns into a cat too.) Amethyst! (Cat heads start emerging from various parts of his body.) Pearl! ... Garnet! *gasps* Dad!
[Trans. Ext. It's a Wash]
Greg: *washing the floor with a hose while singing along to his headphone music, when he hears a bang* Hello? Who's there? We're closed, come back tomoroo- WOOHOHOOO!!
(Greg notices Steven, now an amalgam of cats, and sprays at him in fright. The amalgam flinches, but crawls back towards Greg.)
Steven: *hardly audible* DAD!
Greg: Huh? *sees Steven's face among the cats and gasps* Steven?
Steven: Dad! *starts tearing* Help! (More cats grow on his body.) The cat fingers are taking over my body!! (More cats grow.) Eeeeer!!
Greg: Hold on, wha- *drops his hose* I'll get you out of there! (A cat bites his arm and throws him to the side.)
Steven: No! Bad! Bad cat fingers! (The cats, controlling his body, step in a puddle, hiss and jump to the roof of the car wash.)
Greg: Can't you make them go away?
Steven: I tried, but it made it worse! (More cats keep growing.)  Ohh, my life is over! I can't go on magic adventures! I can't even open the fridge! And I'll never get to have another water fight with you, Dad! Because these things hate... Water! They hate water! Dad, spray me again!
(Greg sprays Steven with the hose and the cats jump down of the building. They then start dashing towards Greg.)
Greg: Aaah!! WOOOAAAHH!!!!
(Steven grabs onto the side of the car wash, preventing the cats from reaching Greg.)
Steven: It's not enough water! *looks inside the car wash and gasps* Turn on the super-wash!
Greg: No, I won't do it! It's too dangerous!
Steven: You've got to! I'm a monster! I'm an adorable cat monster!
Greg: *starts tearing up* No you're not! You're my son!
Steven: Dad! Please! AAH! (The cats begin to engulf his body.)
[Trans. Int. It's a Wash]
(Greg, determined, flips three switches and presses a button, activating the super-wash. Steven then crawls into the car wash. The jets spray Steven with water on all sides, causing the cats to meow in agitation. He then goes through a pair of waxers and another set of jets. Greg watches worriedly as Steven goes through the wash. He then rushes to the exit of the car wash and picks up a hose, ready to spray off any remaining cats. Steven then emerges from the wash, his clothes all torn up, but back to normal.)
Greg: Ah!
Steven: Dad. We did it.
(Steven realizes one of his fingers is still a cat and starts screaming. Greg screams too and sprays it with the hose. The cat finger disappears, and the two sighs in relief.)
[Trans. Ext. Beach House]
(Steven is sitting on the dock, and the Gems returns on the Gem Sloop.)
Pearl: Steven! *climbs onto the dock and examines his hand* Okay, let me see it. Whe-? Y-you got them to go away. (Steven smiles.) It just goes to show, always listen to me, and NEVER listen to Amethyst.
Amethyst: That's fair.
Garnet: It goes to show, you should have a little more faith in Steven. (Pearl blushes.)
Steven: Yeah, that would have been a total CAT-tastrophe!
(Amethyst and Pearl forces a laugh.)
Steven: But I'm feeling much better MEOW!
(The Gems groan.)
Steven: Ehhh? What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?
Garnet: Okay, that's enough. (The Gems walk away.)
Steven: Wait, I've been coming up with cat jokes all morning. You guys, I'm FELINE fine. Everything's PURRfect! Oh come on! I'm just KITTEN around!
(The star iris zooms in on Steven, ending the episode.)
