Amethyst: People say words can't hurt, but I know from experience that's not true.
Jasper: You look so small. You look wrong!
Amethyst: So... I'm short. I stayed in the ground a little too long. Got a little smushed. (Jasper chuckles) But maybe I'm OK like this, and maybe she's blowing things out 'cause she's got her own issues to work out.
Jasper: What??
Amethyst: Who knows? -- But when I do know, 'cause I can always say "Hey, I don't appreciate that."
Jasper: WHO CARES WHAT YOU THINK RUNT!
Amethyst: Just be you. It's up to them or realize they're being bullied..
Jasper: [Frustrated grunt] [sigh] No one deserves to be made fun of because of how they look. If you catch your making hurtful comments... Maybe think about where that anger's coming from. [to Amethyst] How do you keep it cool like that? This's so much pressure.
Amethyst: Pressure made who I am.
Jasper: Wow.
