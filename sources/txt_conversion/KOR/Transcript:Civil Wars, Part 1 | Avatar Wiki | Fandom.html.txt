The scene begins at the tribal palace, where Northern troops are marching to Southern civilians, creating a commotion.
Northern soldier: Everyone, clear the streets! Get back in your homes.
The civilians remain still and look at the troops with contempt. The Northern soldier gestures and two waterbenders bend ice barricades, separating the civilians. The troops continue marching.
Cut to the harbor where waterbenders are forming ice walls around the docks, preventing ships from leaving. Cut to Korra and Unalaq.
Korra: Uncle, why did you bring your troops down from the North?
Unalaq: Now that you've opened the Southern portal, we need to protect it from the people who would do the spirits harm.
Korra: [Confidently.] I can protect it.
Unalaq: I need you for something more important. There is another portal, in the North. Once you open it, spirits and man will be able to move freely between the North and the South in a matter of seconds.
Korra: But, the solstice is over. How am I going to open it?
Unalaq: The spiritual energy is much stronger in the North. And now that you've opened the Southern portal, your energy is stronger as well.
Korra: [Smiling.] With both portals open, our tribes will be united again.
Unalaq: The world will be united again.
The setting changes to the Southern Air Temple, where Tenzin and Pema are relaxing. Kya is sitting on a rock, feeding lemurs.
Tenzin: [Sips his tea.] Ahh, I haven't felt this at peace since- [Bumi jumps in, interrupting Tenzin, who looks in shock.] Aaand, it's over.
Bumi: [Leaps onto rock, with his sister looking in shock.] Gooood morning, Universe.
Kya: [Covering her eyes.] Bumi, please, cover yourself.
Bumi: [To Tenzin.] Well, lookee here, "Vacation Tenzin" has finally decided to join us.
Tenzin: Yes, he has. [Carries Rohan from his wife.] It's so nice to get to spend more time with my family. [To Rohan.] Isn't that right, my little Rohan? [Rohan smiles and coos. To Kya and Bumi.] And I've really enjoyed having you two around. Reminds me of all those great vacations we took as kids with Dad.
Kya: Uhh, I think your memory's a little foggy. [Frowns.] Bumi and I weren't on those great vacations. It was always just you and Dad.
Tenzin: [Thinking.] No, that can't be right. What about the time he took us to Kyoshi Island to ride the elephant koi?
Kya: Nope, we weren't there.
Tenzin: Hmm. Oh, remember Ember Island? Those amazing sand palaces we built on the beach.
Bumi: You mean, you built? We never saw the place.
Tenzin: I could've sworn.
Jinora and Meelo arrive at the scene on air scooters. Poki flies and lands on Meelo's head when both siblings land on solid ground.
Bumi: Morning, kids! [Jinora and Meelo run to their uncle.]
Meelo: Morning, Uncle Bumi! [Points to stomach.] Do you have a baby in there? [Kya, Tenzin and Pema laugh.]
Pema: Where's your sister?
Jinora: Who?
Pema: Ikki. About this tall. [Puts hand at her waist level.] Talks real fast. I'm sure you know her.
Jinora: [Uneasy.] Uhh ...
Meelo: There was a lemur fight, but the bison told us not to worry because a giant was coming. Then we almost got eaten by a shark-squid! [Smiles widely.]
Bumi: [Terrified.] The shark-squid? He's here? It appears my old nemesis has found me. [Frowns.]
Pema: [Folds her hands in annoyance.] Jinora, were you and Meelo teasing your sister again?
Jinora: [Defensively.] I don't know. [Bows.] Maybe. [Hangs head down in shame.] Yes.
Meelo: She ran away.
Pema: [Face reddens in anger.] Honestly, I don't know why you kids can't just get along!
Tenzin: [Walks forward.] It's all right, dear, Ikki couldn't have gone far., [Hands back Rohan.] I'll find her.
Bumi: [Salutes.] Commander Bumi reporting for duty! Search-and-rescue missions are my specialty.
Kya: [Runs forward and holds her brothers' shoulders.] What do you say we all go together?
Tenzin: Sure, I could use the help.
Bumi: When I get back, we'll come out with a plan to take down that shark-squid once and for all!
Meelo: [Grins enthusiastically.] Yeah!
Cut back to a Southern Water Tribe village, followed by the interior of Tonraq's house where there is a meeting.
Tonraq: Thank you for coming, everyone. I know these last few days have been very troubling. [The entire group looks at Varrick.]
Varrick: [Helping himself to cookies.] Troubling? Troubling is when I get that itchy rash that won't go away, and Zhu Li's not around to scratch it. This is shocking. [Stands straight and drops cookies off plate before tossing the plate to the floor.] Nay, sickening! But these kale cookies? Opposite. [To Zhu Li.] Remind me to get the recipe later. [Zhu Li nods.]
Tonraq: What's your point, Varrick?
Varrick: My point is, [Helps himself to cookies once more.] Unalaq's already booted our chieftains out of their palace. How long before he starts telling us what kind of cookies [Tosses cookies away.] we can eat?
Zhu Li: Probably a couple of days.
Varrick: [To Zhu Li.] Rhetorical question, Zhu Li, you gotta keep up. [To gathering.] Not to mention, I've got a cargo ship full of halibut that's rotting thanks to this harbor lockdown? [Enraged.] Who wants to buy a ship full of stinking fish? [Slams plate to floor.] Seriously, it's not rhetorical. I need to sell these fish.
Korra: Chief Unalaq is here to help the South. He wants to show us how to restore balance with the spirits so they'll stop attacking.
Varrick: The only spirit I'm interested in restoring is our spirit of independence. Am I right, people? [Gathering agrees in anger.]
Korra: All Unalaq is trying to do is make our tribes unified again.
Varrick: No, he wants control of our wealth. My wealth. And I like my wealth. If Unalaq doesn't pull his forces out, then we have no choice but to fight for our freedom! [Gathering agrees in anger.]
Korra: You want to start a war? Are you crazy?
Tonraq: Unalaq started this, not us. [Korra scowls, he sighs.] I'm sorry, maybe you could speak with your uncle. Tell him how frustrated we all are. He'll listen to what the Avatar has to say. Do it for me?
Korra: I'll do it for the tribe. [Walks away and slams the door.]
Varrick: I cannot stop eating these things. [To Tonraq.] Look, we all know where this conflict is heading. We need to start preparing for war.
Cut to a sweating Bolin pulling a rickshaw. Desna and Eska are seated at the back, with Pabu in Desna's hand. 
Eska: I will hate to leave this quaint tribe.
Desna: Is that true, Eska?
Eska: Of course not, Desna, I will not miss it at all. I hold immense dislike for the South. [Laughs awkwardly, which Desna follows, to Bolin.] Bolin, laugh at my humorous quip!
Bolin: Yes, dear. [Forces laughter.] So-so funny. [Pabu yawns.]
Bolin stops the rickshaw and runs to the side where he earthbends a small flight of stairs before gesturing for Eska to walk down.
Bolin: [Holding Eska's hand while she descends the stairs.] You know, I'll be really sad when you have to leave. It's been really great getting to know you. [Chuckles lightly.] Really.
Eska: But you will be coming with me to the North. There we will live the rest of our lives together in icy bliss. [Walks away.] Foolish Bolin.
Bolin: [Sees Mako.] Mako! I'm so happy to see you! [Awkwardly hugs Mako.]
Mako: Uh, you all right, bro?
Bolin: [Shakes head.] No! No, I'm not all right. I can't take anymore. Listen, I don't want to live in icy bliss with Eska! [Weeps.] Don't make me. Oh, please, please don't make me.
Mako: Uh, hey, if you're that unhappy, just break up with her.
Bolin: Break up with her? You can do that?
Mako: Yeah. Guys do that all the time.
Bolin: How?
Mako: Just tell her you're not that into her anymore.
Bolin: Oh, no, no, I don't think she'd like that.
Mako: [Holds Bolin's shoulder.] Ending a relationship is kind of like pulling off a blood-sucking leech. You just gotta rip it off and get it over with. You'll feel a lot better afterwards. Trust me.
Bolin: Thanks, Mako. Whew. I'm lucky you're so good at breaking girls' hearts. [Jokingly.] Ha, Korra better watch out. [Mako scowls and folds his arms.] Oooh, no, it's just a-, uh, you kn-, uh, never mind.
Now inside of the Southern Water Tribe palace, Korra walks in to see Unalaq sitting on the throne.
Unalaq: Our next training sessions isn't until tomorrow.
Korra: I'm sorry to interrupt. It's about our conversation this morning.
Unalaq: Yes?
Korra: I understand why you brought your troops here, but I'm afraid it's sending the wrong message.
Unalaq: Your father has been talking to you.
Korra: Not just him. Varrick too. There was a meeting at my parents' house. A lot of Southerners feel like their tribe is being invaded.
Unalaq: I am their chief. I'm uniting, not invading.
Korra: I know, but I'm just afraid if something doesn't change, there could be a civil war.
Unalaq: If the Water Tribes were at war, the other nations would take sides. The dark spirits would thrive off this negative energy, and the world would be thrown into a battle between spirits and man. That would be catastrophic.
Korra: How do we stop it?
Unalaq: We? No, Korra. [He rises from his throne.] This is a war only the Avatar can prevent.
Korra: [Unalaq walks toward Korra.] I'm usually the one starting fights. I don't know how to stop them from happening.
Unalaq: As the Avatar, you must remain neutral in this conflict. You will naturally want to help your people, but showing favoritism will not help our tribes finds unity.
Korra: Maybe Tenzin was right. [Korra looks down, discouraged.] Maybe I'm not ready to be the Avatar.
Unalaq: Tenzin lacked faith in you. [Unalaq places his hand on Korra's shoulder.] But I have no doubt that you will become the most admired Avatar the world has ever known.
Korra: Thank you, Uncle.
Cut to a snow-covered street where a group of four Northern soldiers are marching into view. The civilians glare at the soldiers hatefully. The soldiers glare at the civilians before being pelted by snowballs.
Northern soldier: Who threw those?
Camera pans to roof, showing children giggling. A Northern soldier waterbends and sends the children to the ground.
Northern soldier: You hoodlums think you're tough, huh?
Southern civilian: Pick on a waterbender your own size!
Both civilians and soldiers waterbend, ready to attack.
Korra: [Running between both sides.] Stop!
Southern civilian: Tell these thugs to go back to the North. They're not welcome here anymore!
Northern soldier: These Southerners need to stay in line.
Korra: Everyone, calm down. You're all part of the same tribe, start acting like it.
Southern civilian: [Angry.] You're taking their side? We thought you were one of us.
Korra: [Defensively.] I'm not taking anyone's side. [Is hit by a snowball to the head.] Hey!
Little girl: You're the worst Avatar ever!
Tonraq: Everyone, walk away from this. They're not worth our trouble. Go back to your homes.
Civilians drop their water and walk away. Soldiers follow suit.
Tonraq: Korra, I- [Notices Korra is leaving.] Korra!
Cut to the Southern Air Temple.
Tenzin: Ikki! Ikki! Ikki? Ikki, where are you?
Bumi: [Childlike voice.] Over here, Dad! [Laughs.] Just kidding. It's me!
Tenzin groans in annoyance. Kya comes running up behind him.
Kya: There's no sign of her anywhere.
Tenzin: Why would Ikki run off like this? Ah, it's probably my fault.
Kya: [Crosses arms.] Probably.
Tenzin: Excuse me?
Kya: I'm guessing you've been so busy with your [Makes air quotes.] "duty" to Republic City that you forgot about your duty to your kids.
Bumi: [Laughs.] "Duty."
Kya: [Places hands in her sides as she turns to Bumi; annoyed.] What are you, five years old?
Tenzin: Kya, you're right. I haven't been spending enough time with them. I wish I could be as good a father as Dad was to us.
Kya: Tenzin, your problem is you're exactly like Dad. He was so focused on saving the world and doing his duty, [To Bumi.] don't laugh, that he never had time for us.
Tenzin: Dad was under a lot of pressure.
Bumi: He always had time for you, though, [Pinches Tenzin's cheek, which makes him flinch.] his precious little airbender.
Tenzin: [Pushing Bumi aside.] Dad loved us all equally. Besides, it all happened a long time ago. Why are we even talking about this?
Kya: Because you seem to have some grandiose delusion that we had a perfect, happy-go-lucky childhood. Guess what. We didn't!
Tenzin: We need to keep moving if we want to find Ikki before dark.
Kya: [Mockingly.] See what he's doing there, Bumi? Classic airbender technique. Cutting and running when things get tough!
Tenzin: Uch.
Bumi: [Teasingly.] Yeah. Did Dad teach you that move?
Cut back to the Southern Water Tribe, where Korra rides atop Naga and approaches Mako.
Mako: How was your day, sweetie?
Korra: [Sarcastically.] Oh, fabulous. [Scowls.] My tribe's about to go to war, and I'm supposed to stop it, but will anyone listen to me? No! And I didn't ask for my father's help. Can't he just let me be the Avatar?
Mako: Uh, do you want advice, or am I just supposed to listen? I'm still not clear on that.
Korra: Ugh. I'm sorry. My dad just gets me all worked up.
Mako: How about you take a break from all this Avatar stuff, and we go out for a quiet dinner. Just the two of us.
Korra grins, before the scene changes to a dining area where Korra gives a bored expression, while the camera pans to Mako, who gives the same expression. Cut to the opposite side where Desna and Eska are seated. Camera pans to Bolin.
Bolin: [Laughs awkwardly.] Isn't this fun, huh? We never get to spend enough time together, just the ... five of us. So fun.
Eska: Excuse us while we retrieve more sustenance. [Both twins walk away.]
Bolin: You guys gotta save me.
Mako: I though you were breaking up with her. What happened to "ripping off the leech"?
Bolin: I tried! But anytime I bring up the subject, she threatens to freeze me in a block of ice and feed me to dolphin piranhas!
Mako: So it was more like you tugged at the leech.
Bolin: Yes, over and over and over, but it won't come off. Why didn't you warn me your cousin had the power to reach into my heart and crush my soul with her bare hands.
Korra: Uh, 'cause I thought it was pretty obvious?
Bolin: No, no, not to me it wasn't. I'm very bad at reading people. You should know that by now. [Sobs.] Oh, man. Oh! Do something, Avatar!
Cut back to the Southern Air Temple, where Bumi, Kya, and Tenzin are walking. It is getting dark and Tenzin is holding a lantern.
Bumi: You know, this reminds me of a search-and-rescue mission I commanded years ago in the mountains outside of Ba Sing Se.
Tenzin: [Groans.] Here we go.
Bumi: For five days we scoured the beast of a mountain, fighting our ways through blizzards, sandstorms, and three typhoons. Finally, we found the men huddled in a cave, seconds from death. With no time to lose, I piled all twelve of those poor souls on my back and single-handedly carried them down the mountain to safety.
Tenzin: [Snaps.] And how exactly is that supposed to help us find Ikki?
Bumi: It was supposed to inspire you. Clearly, you know nothing about being a leader of men. That's probably why the Avatar fired you.
Tenzin: I'm sick of your far-fetched tales. Three typhoons?
Bumi: Well, I may have thrown in an extra typhoon or two for dramatic effect, but-
Kya: Quit arguing and bring that lantern over here. I found footprints.
Tenzin walks up to Kya and follows the footprints with his lantern.
Tenzin: Come on! [Runs down the path, following the footprints.]
Bumi: No, follow me! This will get us down fifty times faster. [Leaps onto rocks alongside the waterfall.]
Kya: Bumi, it's pitch black and the rocks are slippery. You're going to hurt yourself.
Bumi: Come on, you wimps! If I can do it, it should be no problem for a couple of benders.
Kya: Fine.
Kya descends the waterfall using waterbending to hold her. Tenzin leaps from ledge to ledge, using airbending to boost his leap. Both soon overtake their older brother, who grumbles.
Kya: [Teasingly.] You were right, Bumi! That was faster!
Tenzin: At least fifty times faster, by my calculations. [Chuckles with his sister.]
Bumi: [Grumbling.] Oh, so Tenzin's the funny guy now.
Tenzin: If you need an airlift down, just say the word.
Bumi: Bah, I don't need your help. I've got everything under control. [Slips and falls.] Agh!
Tenzin: [Shocked and worried.] Bumi!
Cut to the Southern Water Tribe, where Korra is riding back to her home. She enters and finds her mother seated.
Korra: Did Dad send you to talk to me?
Senna: Your father doesn't know I'm here. [Korra sits beside her.] Korra, what's going on between you two?
Korra: Ask Dad. [Looks away.]
Senna: I've tried, but he won't talk about it. Honey, it breaks my heart to see our family being torn apart like this.
Korra: You want to know what's been going on? I found out Dad's been lying to me my whole life. Unalaq told me everything; how Dad and Tenzin kept me trapped down here while I trained; how Dad got banished from the North.
Senna: So, the truth is out.
Korra: You knew? And you never said anything.
Senna: We were trying to keep our family together, to give you a normal childhood.
Korra: I never wanted a normal childhood. All I ever wanted to be was the Avatar. But everyone keeps holding me back, even my own parents! Unalaq's the only one who believes in me.
Senna: That's not true, Korra.
Korra: No? Then why is everyone in the South turning against me, when all I'm trying to do is help them?
Senna: The problems between the North and the South started long before you were born. You can't expect to undo them in a day.
Korra: So I should just sit back and let the Water Tribes go to war?
Senna: No, but this situation might be out of your control. Varrick's been plotting a rebellion against Unalaq. He asked your father to join, and-
Korra: [Stands up.] Dad is part of a rebellion?
Senna: I don't know, but I don't want you getting caught in the middle of it.
Korra: It's too late, Mom. I'm already in the middle of it. [Leaves the house.]
Senna: [Runs out to door.] Korra!
Cut to the interior of the palace, where Korra runs in.
Korra: Uncle! [Stops, and notices Northern troops tied up and unconscious.] Oh, no. Uncle? [Runs and stops at a corner and watches a masked rebel carrying an unconscious Unalaq while three others stand guard.] Dad? [Runs to the rebel.] Dad, don't do this.
Rebel: Turn around, Avatar, and pretend you didn't see anything.
Korra: No. Leave Unalaq and go. I'll tell him I tried to stop you, but you escaped. We can still avoid a war.
Rebel: No, we can't.
The rebel traps Korra within an ice wall while they escape. Korra punches a gap within her enclosure and pursues the rebels. While the rebels were running down a flight of stairs, Korra freezes the handrails and slides down in front of them.
Rebel: Get him out of here!
The rebel leader runs away. Korra tries to follow, but is blocked by an ice wall.
Korra: We're all part of the same tribe. I don't wanna hurt you.
The rebels prepare to attack Korra, but she dodges their offenses. Korra leaps up and grabs a banner while evade the rebel's offenses. She runs up a pillar and tosses the banner against two rebels, using airbending to ensnare them. Korra continues dodging the remaining rebels' offenses and grabs the rope of one of the rebels and kicks another rebel, slamming him unconscious on the staircase. She ties the rope around the rebel's wrist and swings him to a pillar, knocking him out. Korra runs out of the palace to see the rebel leader leaving.
Korra: Dad, stop! [Waterbends at the snowmobile, causing it to change course and crash.] Why did you do this, Dad? [Removes the rebel's hood, revealing him to not be Tonraq.] What? Who are you? Where's my father?
Rebel leader: He wouldn't help us. He's a traitor, just like you.
Unalaq awakens. Cut back to the palace, where the rebels were led away in handcuffs.
Unalaq: Thank you for saving my life.
Korra: I'm just glad I got here in time.
Unalaq: Find Varrick. I want him to freeze in prison with the rest of these traitors. [Troops lead rebels away.]
Korra: Wait, you can't just lock them away. That will only make the South angrier.
Unalaq: You want them to go free?
Korra: No. But let them stand trial for what they did. Every Water Tribe citizen deserves that right.
Unalaq: [Softens.] Very well. I will respect the Avatar's wishes in this matter.
Korra: [Smiles.] Thank you, Uncle.
Cut back to the Southern Air Temple, where Kya is healing a dazed Bumi.
Kya: I told you those rocks were slippery. You're lucky you didn't kill yourself.
Bumi: You done with the lecture, Mom?
Kya: Oh, grow up! You haven't changed one bit since we were kids. You're still trying to prove you can do everything a bender can. Well, you can't. Deal with it.
Bumi: And you're not our mother. You don't get to tell me what I can and can't do. Deal with that. [Kya stops waterbending, causing the water to splash onto Bumi.] Ugh.
Kya: Good luck healing yourself with your special nonbending powers.
Bumi: [Shakes water off head.] Hey, hey, back me up here, Tenzin.
Tenzin: Kya's right. You're the oldest of us, but you always acted like the youngest. I had to become the responsible one.
Kya: You think you're the responsible one? [Approaches Tenzin.] Where were you after Dad died and Mom was all alone? Because I was the only one who packed up and moved my whole life to be with her.
Tenzin: Sure, after years of flitting around the world, trying to find yourself. It was time for you to settle down somewhere. [Agitatedly.] You two have no idea how it feels to have the future of an entire culture on your shoulders.
Bumi: [Sarcastically.] Oh, boo-hoo. Must've been real hard for you, flying around the world with Dad, riding elephant koi all day.
Tenzin: Oh, so that's what this is all about.
Kya: That's what it's always been about. You think you're some savior who has to carry on Dad's legacy.
Tenzin: Who else is going to do it?
Kya: How about all of us?
Bumi: Yeah, we're Aang's kids too.
Kya: We never should have come on this vacation.
Bumi: I couldn't agree more.
Tenzin: [Agitated.] Well, I didn't want you to come in the first place. I can't be around you two right now. Go back to the temple and see if Ikki returned. I'll keep looking out here.
Bumi: [Snaps.] Fine.
Kya: [Snaps.] Fine.
Tenzin: Fine.
Kya and Bumi walk back to the air temple, leaving Tenzin alone as he continues the path.
Cut to the Southern Water Tribe village where Korra rides back to her home and opens the door to see her parents eating. Tonraq and Senna look up to her, smiling.
Korra: Is it okay if I come in?
Senna: Of course. We heard what happened. Are you okay?
Korra: [Tears up and hugs her father.] I'm so glad you weren't there. I don't know what I would've done.
Tonraq: I had no idea how far Varrick was willing to go. My brother and I have our differences, but I would never attack him.
Korra: I'm sorry for thinking you had anything to do with the rebels. And for all the pain I've caused you and Mom.
Tonraq: I'm the one who should apologize. After I saw the Southern Lights return, I was so proud of you. I never should've held you back.
Senna: When your father and I found each other, all we wanted was to live a simple life and raise a family. But, then we discovered you were the Avatar, and simple was over. We knew one day the world would need you, and you wouldn't need us anymore.
Korra: Mom, Dad, [Hugs her parents.] of course I still need you.
Tonraq: [Unalaq walks in.] We weren't expecting you.
Unalaq: [Four soldiers enter the room.] Tonraq, Senna, you are under arrest and will stand trial.
Tonraq: Trial? For what?
Unalaq: For conspiring to assassinate me.
Cut to Korra and her parents looking in shock and disbelief.
Fades to credits.
