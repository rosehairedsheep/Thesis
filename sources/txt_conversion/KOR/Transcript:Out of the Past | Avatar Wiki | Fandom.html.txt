The episode opens by showing a basement room with a metal box in the center and a dark staircase are also seen. A door at the top of the stairs opens and Tarrlok steps in, using bloodbending to levitate Korra several inches off the ground in front of him. Korra groans as he levitates her down the stairs and into the box. 
Korra: [Strained, while looking at Tarrlok.] What are you doing? [When Korra is entirely in the box, he releases his bloodbending grip on her, causing her to land, and slams the metal door shut; aggressively.] Tarrlok! [Korra begins pounding on the door as Tarrlok walks up the stairs.] You can't keep me in here forever!
Tarrlok steps outside and gets back into his vehicle. He drives away, revealing that Korra's prison is in a remote location in the middle of snowy mountains. Cut to Air Temple Island at dawn as a telephone rings. Tenzin and Pema are asleep in bed with Meelo between them. Meelo sits up, rubs his eyes, and crawls over his father's face to answer the phone, waking him up in the process.
Meelo: [Annoyed.] Who is this? It's six in the morning! This better be important!
Tenzin: [Sitting up and taking the phone from him, leaving him somewhat annoyed.] Councilman Tenzin here. [Camera rotates around him to show his shock at the news he just received.] What?!
Cut to a photographer taking a photo of the damages in City Hall. Tenzin arrives, while the camera, through the lens of a photo camera, zooms in on an electrified glove and several Equalists weapons. Cut to Tarrlok, who is having his arm wound healed by a male healer.
Tenzin: What happened? [Walks toward Tarrlok.] What was Korra doing at City Hall?
Tarrlok: As I told Chief Saikhan, [Stands up as he rolls down his sleeve.] Korra came to my office late last night. She was upset that I arrested her friends. She asked me to release them and ... that's when the Equalists attacked. [Flashback to Tarrlok dropping an Equalist chi blocker mask.] I tried to protect Korra, but we were outnumbered. [Flashback of Tarrlok throwing a bola around a pillar.] Then, I was electrocuted. [Flashback of Tarrlok, as he uses an Equalist glove to electrify himself in the shoulder while growling.] When I came to, the police had arrived. But Korra was gone. [Moves toward Tenzin; sighs regretfully.] I'm so sorry. [Bows and turns to Saikhan.] Chief Saikhan, mobilize the entire police force. We have to find the Avatar.
Cut to Lin Beifong lying in bed, listening to the radio.
Radio: [Static burst.] We interrupt your regularly scheduled broadcast to bring you this special report. Late last night, Equalists attacked City Hall, [Lin sits upright, startled, and begins tuning the radio to listen more closely.] subduing Councilman Tarrlok and capturing Avatar Korra. Details are still coming in, b-
Lin switches off the radio. She gets slowly out of bed, pausing for a moment to groan and hold her arm. She crosses to a cupboard and opens it, looking at her Metalbending Police uniform arranged inside. She stands in her underclothes with her back to the cupboard and metalbends her uniform onto her body. She glances down at the police insignia on her chest and tears it off, before putting on a long coat. Cut to the Toph statue in front of police headquarters, before cutting to Asami lying on her back on a cot in her cell. She sits up as Lin metalbends the door off its hinges and tosses it away.
Lin: Hope you got enough beauty rest. Come on, I'm busting you out.
Asami: [Smiling.] Thanks. I owe you.
Cut to close-up on Bolin's face. Mako and Bolin are standing in their cell. Mako has his back to Bolin, who is attempting to pee in a toilet in the corner of the room.
Mako: Are you done yet?
Bolin: Cover your ears! I can't go with you listening.
Mako sighs and covers his ears. He glances up as the cell door is metalbent off its hinges.
Mako: Asami! [The two embrace and kiss.]
Bolin: Ahh! [Bolin blushes.] A little privacy, please!
Mako: [To Asami.] Are you all right?
Asami: I'm fine! It's so good to see you.
Lin: Hate to break up your lovers' reunion, but Korra's in trouble. Amon captured her.
Mako: [Camera zooms in on Mako, as they look at her in horror.] No. No, she can't be gone!
Lin: Come on, we have an Avatar to rescue.
The three teens run from inside the cell. There is a zipping noise and Bolin stops, squeaks, and blushes.
Lin: [Cut back to Lin as she turns her head outward; her expression indifferent; bluntly.] Your fly was down.
Bolin: [Embarrassed.] Thanks for catching that.
Shot of Korra's mountain prison, before cutting to the box in the basement. Korra is throwing herself against the sides of the box, kicking, and pounding trying to break herself out by sheer force.
Korra: [Pounding on the door.] Somebody! Help! Please! [She slumps to the ground, exhausted and realizing the futility of her actions.] Please. [Tenzin's voice is heard in Korra's memory.]
Tenzin: I urge you to meditate on these visions. I believe Aang's spirit is trying to tell you something.
Korra inhales and assumes a meditative pose. Flashback of Aang's experiences. He is standing in a street and turns around as he hears multiple booted footsteps behind him.
Toph: [Voice-over; mildly annoyed.] What are you doing here, Aang? [Cut to Toph and several metalbending police officers.] I told you, I have this under control.
Aang: [Cut to a concerned Aang.] Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't get involved, but if what those victims said is true, we're not dealing with a normal criminal.
Toph: [Smiling.] Fine. Follow me, Twinkle Toes.
Aang: [Annoyed.] Toph, I'm forty years old. You think you could stop with the nicknames?
Toph: [Walking away and still smiling.] 'Fraid not. [Aang grimaces in annoyance and follows.]
Cut to an aerial shot as the group approaches a table in Kwong's Cuisine, where a man is eating.
Toph: [Pointing at the man at the table.] It's over! You're under arrest, Yakone!
Yakone: [Cut to a close-up of Yakone with his eyes closed and head down; calmly.] What is Republic City coming to? Used to be, a man could enjoy his lunch in peace. [Toph bends a cable from a spool at her belt around his wrist and yanks him forward, knocking over his table. A policeman comes to tie his arms behind him.] What's the big idea?
Aang: We have dozens of witnesses, Yakone. We know what you are.
Toph: [Gestures to guards.] Take him away.
Yakone: [Being led away; yelling back to Aang and Toph.] I've beaten every trumped-up charge you yahoos have brought against me! [Confidently and arrogantly.] And I'll beat this one, too.
Close-up on Aang's serious face, which changes to Korra's face as the flashback ends.
Korra: [Eyes open wide.] Whoa. [To the ceiling.] I finally connected with you, Aang. [Confused.] But, what are you trying to tell me? [With a sad expression.] A way out of this box would be nice. [She inhales, closes her eyes and begins meditating again.]
Cut to Lin, Mako, Bolin, and Asami walking into Tenzin's office. Tenzin is on the phone.
Tenzin: [Over phone.] I have to go. Call me back the minute you hear anything. [Hangs up and stands up; very surprised.] Lin? Wh-wh-what are y- What are y- You should be in the hospital! And you three! [Points.] You should be in prison!
Lin: I figured you could use our help finding Korra.
Mako: [Steps forward anxiously.] Do you have any leads?
Tenzin: I've been on the phone all morning, but nothing yet.
Mako: [Excitedly with a new idea.] We need Naga! She can track Korra.
Tenzin: I'm afraid her polar bear dog is missing as well.
Bolin: Then where do we start?
Lin: My guess is the Equalists are hiding underground in the maze of tunnels beneath the city.
Asami: [Bitterly.] Underground ... just like my father's secret factory. Figures.
Bolin: [Remembering a past experience.] Yeah! Yeah, that makes sense! When those chi blockers had me in their truck, it sounded like we drove into a tunnel!
Mako: I know where to start looking! Come on! [He, Bolin, and Asami rush from the room.]
Lin: [To Tenzin.] Wherever Amon is keeping Korra, I bet that's where my officers are too.
Tenzin: Let's bring them all home, Lin.
Cut to shot of downtown Republic City, as the group flies in on Oogi. They land in a deserted street and dismount off Oogi.
Mako: [Points down a road.] The truck with Bolin took off down this alley. [The group jogs to the next intersection.]
Asami: Which way?
Bolin: Hmm. This way kinda ... [Sniffs the air.] smells familiar.
Lin metalbends the sole of her shoe back and uses seismic sense to test the ground.
Lin: There's a tunnel nearby. [Sets off as the rest of the group follows and slides down an embankment.]
Mako: [Indicating a large tunnel entrance with a metal gate.] There!
Lin: [Inspecting the ground.] Motorcycle tracks.
Mako: Korra has to be in there ... somewhere.
Lin metalbends the gate open. Cut to the group walking into an intersection of tunnels. Mako uses firebending to light the way.
Mako: Let's try this way.
Asami: And what if Korra's not down there?
Mako: [Sharply.] Then we pick another tunnel until we find her! [Asami looks hurt.]
Cut to the group walking down the tunnel. Asami has dropped back, placing herself so that she is next to Bolin.
Asami: Hey, is Mako all right? He seems really worried about Korra.
Bolin: [Agreeing.] Yeah, we all are!
Asami: I know, but, he's your brother. Do you think that he likes Korra as more than just a friend?
Bolin: [In a slightly high-pitched voice and chuckling nervously.] W-What? No! That's, just gossip, where'd you hear that? [Pointing to Asami.] Crazy talk is coming out of your mouth right now. Heh ...
Asami: [Placing her hand on his shoulder; in a demanding tone.] What do you know, Bolin? Come on, spill it.
Bolin: Nothing! I mean, there was this one time during the tournament when Mako and Korra kissed, but-
Asami: [In shock.] They ... kissed? [Looks at Mako's back.]
Bolin: Believe me, I was upset too, but, I'm over it. I don't think it meant anything.
Asami: [Upset.] I doubt that. [Starts walking after the others when the noise of motorcycles is heard.]
Lin: Hide!
The five duck behind a pillar as the Equalist motorcycles approach. One Equalist flips a switch on his motorcycle dash that in turn opens a secret door in the opposite wall of the tunnel. The two motorcycles race inside and the door promptly closes. Lin makes a face and crosses the tunnel, followed by the others. She runs her hand across the door and uses metalbending to trigger the opening mechanism and force the door up. The group rushes in and the door closes behind them. They approach a large open space, where Equalists are loading supplies onto tram carts on tracks that lead into various tunnels. An Equalist with a clipboard is directing loading and traffic.
Equalist traffic director: That tram goes to the training camp. [Tram disappears down a tunnel and he walks to another one that has just arrived. A female Equalist climbs down.]
Female Equalist: Everything was delivered to the prison, sir. [Both walk away.]
Tenzin: [Whispering to the others.] That's where they must be keeping Korra.
Lin: We need to get down that tunnel.
Lin signals the group with her hand and they all run toward the tram and jump in. The tram starts to move down the tunnel. At the tunnel's exit, two Equalists are waiting for the tram. A light flashes and an alarm sounds to signal the tram's arrival. It coasts to a stop with nothing inside.
Equalist: It's empty!
Equalist: [Sarcastically.] Yeah, I can see that.
From inside the tunnel, Lin uses her metalbending cables to grab the two Equalists and drag them inside. The two Equalists are shown tied up next to each other.
Lin: [To Bolin and Asami.] You two, keep an eye on them.
Lin uses her seismic sense to search the prison.
Lin: My officers are inside.
Mako: [Curiously.] What about Korra?
Lin: I don't see her yet.
Mako, Lin, and Tenzin head off down the corridor. They turn the corner and see two Equalists, who prepare to attack them. Tenzin uses his airbending to knock them against a wall. Mako runs toward them and grabs one of them, removing his mask. 
Mako: [Angrily.] Avatar Korra. Where are you keeping her?
Cut to Lin peering into the prison cell, where her metalbending officers are being kept. She metalbends the bars apart and walks in.
Officer: [Wearily.] Chief Beifong?
Lin: I'm too late. That monster already took your bending, didn't he?
The officer nods his head. Lin looks down sadly.
Lin: [Sadly.] I'm so sorry. [In a normal tone.] Come on, let's gets you out of here.
All the officers get up and follow Lin out of the cell. Cut to Mako, who has pinned the Equalist against a wall.
Mako: [Angrily.] I'll ask you one more time; [Ignites his right hand.] where is she?
Equalist: [Weakly while grabbing Mako's arm.] We don't have the Avatar, and the Equalists didn't attack City Hall. Tarrlok's lying.
Mako: [Drops the man back to the ground; surprised.] What?
Lin walks up.
Lin: I scanned the entire prison. Korra's not here.
Mako: [Letting go of the man, who collapses while dispersing the flame in his hand.] Why would Tarrlok make up a story about getting attacked?
Tenzin: Because he has Korra. He fooled us all!
A siren starts sounds and the group runs back to where Bolin and Asami are standing guard.
Bolin: Let's go, people!
Everyone gets into the tram, which takes off. Equalists in another tram start to catch up from behind. Bolin uses his earthbending to collapse the tunnel sides, causing the tram to crash in the rubble.
Bolin: [Jubilantly and challengingly.] Try to chi block that, fools!
Lin, at the front of the tram, notices an army of Equalists waiting up ahead. Among them is the Lieutenant and several mecha tanks.
Lin: We've got more company! [Lin metalbends a rail from the ceiling onto the track.] Hang on!
