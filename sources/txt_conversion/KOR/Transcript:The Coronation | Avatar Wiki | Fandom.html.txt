As the title card fades, the scene opens on City Hall; a few spirits play on the spirit vines lining the square.
Wu: [Waving his arms as he acts out his vision for Mako, who is standing in front of him.] So then the crowds are gathered, all excited to see my coronation, when all of a sudden, these boulders come rolling through. And guess what pops out of 'em? Earthbender dames! These gals start banging the boulders like drums, and sing the song of my royal lineage. [Puts fingers together.] It's the most dynamite six-hour show you'll ever see in your life. [Puts hands on his hips.]
Mako: Shouldn't you be getting ready to, [Shrugs shoulders.] I don't know ... rule a whole nation?
Wu: [Waving his hand.] Now, now, now, don't get yourself in a tizzy. [Puts index finger on Mako's chest.] I'll have ministers for all that! [Putting an arm around Mako.] No, sir, Mako, when we get to Ba Sing Se, it'll just be two kooky pals, living the life! [Pats Mako on the chest.]
Mako: [Sarcastically.] Yay ...
President Raiko enters the scene.
Raiko: Getting excited for your big day?
Wu: Does a platypus-bear poop in‒ Hey! [Turns around angrily as he sees metalbenders putting up spectator stands. He races over to berate them.] You can't put bleachers there! There won't be enough room for the Dance of the Badgermoles! Look, it's going to go like this. [Proceeds to dance as Mako and Raiko look on.]
Mako: You sure that's the guy you want running the Earth Kingdom?
Tenzin enters the scene. Him too, looking at Wu's dance.
Raiko: Trust me. We'll be sending a delegation of experienced advisers to handle day-to-day governing.
Tenzin: [Cut to Tenzin, Mako, and Raiko.] I see the prince is becoming accustomed to the burdens of leadership.
Raiko: You know royals. They love a ceremony. Have you received any word on the Avatar's location?
Tenzin: [Close-up as he turns to face them.] Not yet, but I have airbenders all over the world on the lookout for her. [Worried.] I hope they find her soon. I'm concerned about reports I've heard regarding Kuvira's growing military. They say she's throwing some of her dissenters into prison camps.
Cut to Raiko and Mako, while Tenzin has his back to the camera.
Raiko: Well, she'll be stepping down tomorrow. We can worry about correcting any of her mistakes after that.
Mako: And you're not worried about her handing power over to Prince Wu?
Raiko: [Close-up.] When Kuvira started cleaning up the Earth Kingdom, she knew her position wasn't permanent. She gave me her word that she'd step down.
Tenzin: [Cut to Wu, who is still doing his dance.] Still, I'd feel a lot better if Korra were here.
Next cut shows the swamp, where Korra and Toph are shown in Toph's dwelling. Korra stands on the left, while Toph sits on the right, drinking tea.
Korra: You got to help me get back into Avatar fighting shape. [Close-up.] I'm getting my butt kicked by losers all over the Earth Kingdom. The world needs me.
Toph: [Cut to Toph.] Get over yourself! The world doesn't need you one bit.
Korra: [Cut to a view of both women, with Korra behind Toph.] But, while I've been the Avatar, I've stopped some really bad people from doing some really bad things.
Toph: Listen, when I was Chief of Police in Republic City, I worked my butt off busting criminals. But did that make crime disappear? Nope. If there's one thing I learned on the beat, it's that the names change, but the street stays the same.
Korra: So, basically, you're saying that everything I've ever accomplished has been pointless. [More to herself.] And I thought Beifong was grumpy.
Toph: [Upbeat.] I'm the original Beifong!
Korra: So ... you're not going to train me?
Toph: Well, I was planning on soaking my feet in mud for a few weeks. [Sighs.] But I can't stand you being so pathetic and getting your butt kicked all the time. All right, I guess I can help.
Korra: Thank you!
Korra moves in to hug Toph, but Toph bends a wall between them, knocking Korra down.
Toph: Na-uh-uh-uh. You want to hug something, [Pushes wall down again.] go hug a tree. [Close-up, smiling.] We're here to work!
Cut to Wu's hotel in Republic City, where Bolin, Kuvira, Baatar Jr. and the rest of Kuvira's delegation arrive.
Bolin: Hello Republic Cit-ay! Bolin ... is back! [The frame zooms suddenly and dramatically on Eska, who is standing in the lobby with her brother Desna. Bolin sees her staring at him and reels back, seized by a fit of terror. He becomes more downbeat.] And ... Eska is also here.
Eska: [Slides in front of Bolin.] I see you have replaced me with a new girlfriend. [Kuvira is brought into the shot, talking to a soldier.] Well done, she seems very threatening.
Bolin: Oh no no, that's Kuvira, she's kind of my boss.
Eska: [Cut to Eska and Desna.] Boss, girlfriend. Same thing.
Cam: [Interrupting, addressing Eska.] I'm afraid there's been a mistake, Your Eminence. We have you and your brother booked in the same room, with only one bed.
Eska: It's no mistake. Desna sleeps in the tub.
Eska shoots a look over her shoulder and walks off with her brother. Cut to Varrick, who is waiting for Zhu Li, who is carrying four suitcases, to catch up with him.
Varrick: Never thought I'd be allowed back in the Republic City Four Elements. [Zhu Li puts down a lot of suitcases which appear to be very heavy.] Raiko must have turned purple when Kuvira made him pardon me of my alleged crimes.
Zhu Li: You're an upstanding citizen again, sir.
Varrick: [Excited again, he moves his arms up and down as the cut focuses on him.] Upstanding is right! [Quiets down to a whisper, moving his eyebrows up and down.] And don't forget to fill the extra bag with as many of those little soaps as you can grab. [Fixes collar.] Love the lavender scent.
Mako and Wu walk in with two guards who are at the door. Mako immediately spots Bolin, who is standing in the center albeit with his back turned.
Mako: Bolin! [Bolin turns around, and they trade some mock-punches before hugging each other.] Look at you! My little brother got all ... important.
Bolin: I know, right? I see myself in the mirror sometimes and I think I'm in trouble before I realize: it's only me.
Mako: [Quick cut to Mako.] So, what's it like working for Kuvira? [Cut to Kuvira, who is talking to Baatar Jr..] From what I've heard, she's pretty harsh.
Bolin: [Cut back to Bolin and Mako.] No! I—I mean, she can be tough, sure, but we're turning around the Earth Kingdom like you wouldn't believe! You remember how bad Grandma's neighborhood in Ba Sing Se was? All that's completely changed, I mean, we are really ... helping people. But what have you been up to? Fighting crime? [Mimics fighting.] Busting triads? Chasing the ladies, [Shouldering Mako playfully in the chest.] Mako-style?
Mako: [Downbeat.] Well, I've been working for Wu. [Looks over to Wu, who is fixing his hair in the reflection of a window.] And, uhhh ... [Lets his head hang in disappointment.] Yeah.
Bolin: So, have you seen Korra yet?
Mako: No. She was supposed to come in with Tonraq, but he said she left the South Pole months ago. No one knows where she is.
Bolin gets a worried look on his face. Cut to Suyin, who is handed the keys to her room, when she is approached by Baatar Jr.
Baatar Jr.
Mother.
Suyin: Hello, Baatar Jr.
Baatar Jr.
It's just "Baatar" now. So, now that you've seen all the good we've done since we left Zaofu, you must be sorry that you didn't come and help us.
Suyin: I don't know if I'd call marching all over the Earth Kingdom, forcing people to bow to Kuvira, "doing good".
Baatar Jr.
You're going to have to get over your grudge with her. I'm sure you've heard that we're engaged. She's going to be an official member of our family.
Suyin: I'm just glad she'll be stepping down after tomorrow.
Baatar Jr.
You prefer to be ruled by [Looks over his shoulder toward Wu, who is trying to chat up Kuvira; voice-over.] that royal idiot?
Wu: I hope I'm not out of order saying this: You're pretty easy on the eyes for a military type. [Kuvira ignores him.] I'll put in a good word for you with the hotel staff, maybe get you a little upgrade. I've been living here for years, they love me.
Kuvira: I won't be needing your help. We've reserved the presidential suite.
Wu: Well, I think someone is pulling your chain, gumdrop! See, I'm in the presidential suite.
Kuvira: [Turns to face Wu again with a smug smile on her face.] Not anymore. I had you moved out.
Wu: [Surprised.] Wait, what? [Angrily grabs Cam by the collar.] Cam, where's all my stuff?
Cam: [Blankly.] We've moved you into a very nice junior suite on the seventh floor.
Wu: [Seriously disappointed.] Junior suite?
Kuvira: [Smiling triumphantly.] Something you should know about me: I always get what I want.
Cut to Mako and Wu at City Hall, with Wu visibly being worried.
Gun: [Off-screen.] Your royal cabinet is here, your majesty!
Wu: Where have you been? My coronation is in ten minutes! [Gun and two other walk up to Wu.] Where's everyone else? Where are the Seven Sacred Chests of Exquisite Finery? Where are my grandfather's taffeta pantaloons?
Gun: Sadly, most of your servants were scattered and the royal things were looted after the queen was [He pauses, choosing his words.] removed from office. So your coronation may not have some of the usual items ... like ... the crown.
Wu: There's no crown?! How can you have a coronation without a crown? [Getting distressed.] How will people know when I'm officially the king?
Gun: [Opening a small jewel box which contains an earring; voice-over.] We still have one of the royal jewels we can pin on you.
Wu: [Annoyed.] An earring?
Gun: Think of it more as a royal brooch. [Holds the earring up and it sparkles.]
Wu: Are you telling me that there are no dancing badgermoles? No acrobat bell ringers, no horn blowing announcery guy?
Gun: It will be a very simple, intimate, elegant ceremony. A wonderful day for your kingdom. Just try on the brooch, Your Grace, you will see it looks beautiful ... [Tries to pin the earring on Wu, but he stops him and walks off.]
Wu: Don't ... touch me.
Cut to the swamp, where Korra and Toph are facing off.
Toph: Okay, bring it!
Korra tries to knock her down with airbending, but Toph evades every blast with her hands behind her back, before knocking Korra down with a single blast of mud. Korra lands in a pool of mud, all dirty, when a poll of grass in blown into her face and a frog-squirrel jumps onto her shoulder and croaks, much to Korra's annoyance.
Toph: Tell me what you did wrong.
Korra: [Picking up the animal and putting it on her knee.] Well, I was thinking that you were ...
Toph: [Interrupts Korra.] Exactly! You were thinking! [Turns around.] Go again.
Korra gets up and tries again, but Toph effortlessly evades everything Korra throws at her, and finally knocks her down again by blasting her away with a stream of mud. She lands in a shallow pool, and turns on her back when Toph stands beside her again.
Toph: Pathetic. Of all the Avatar's I've worked with, you're by far the worst. I know that's only one other Avatar, [Korra stands up and has a massive elbow leech on her elbow. Toph pulls it off with one quick tug.] but still.
Korra: [As the leech pops off.] Gah! Hey! It seems like you're enjoying having someone around to beat up an awful lot.
Toph: Yeah, the swampbenders out here really can't take a punch.
Korra: So ... what made you want to drop out and disconnect from the rest of the world?
Toph: I'm more connected to the world than you've ever been! The roots and vines ... they run all over the world. I can see Su and Lin, Zaofu and Republic City. I see everything. [Korra gets a smile on her face, and silently tries to take Toph by surprise, but she's knocked down once again by the old woman.] You're blind compared to me.
Cut to Wu's coronation in Republic City. Gun pins the earring on Wu.
Gun: Now rise, Wu of the Hou-Ting Dynasty, King of all the Earth Lands and glorious defender of Ba Sing Se. Long may you reign!
A few people are applauding in the crowd.
Spectator #1
[Disinterested.] Go Wu! Woohoo ...
Spectator #2
[Just as disinterested.] Woohoo ...
Wu: [Now addressing the crowd through the microphone.] Thank you, for that incredibly brief, but very moving ceremony. I am touched by the love of my devoted countrymen, who have worked so hard to restore their beloved leader to the throne. One of them deserves special attention. [Turns to Kuvira.] Kuvira, rise! [She walks over to him.] For your service to the realm, I would like to present you with the Kyoshi Medal of Freedom, our nation's highest honor, which was somehow not stolen, unlike the royal pinky rings.
Kuvira: Thank you. And if you don't mind, I would like to say a few words.
Wu: Why not? [Annoyed.] We've got six hours to fill ...
Kuvira: [Now addressing the crowd through the microphone.] Growing up in Zaofu, with Suyin Beifong, [Shot shows Suyin, sporting a distrustful look.] I learned that the idea of a royal family passing a title from one generation to the next was archaic, and that technology and innovation should be what drives a nation forward. It was the pathetic rule of kings and queens that caused the Earth Kingdom to descend into such incredible disarray. It's taken me three years to get it back on track, and there is no way I will allow it to slip back into the dark ages. [Shot shows Tenzin and Raiko giving each other a worried look.] I'd like to make an announcement to the world: the Earth Kingdom is no more. And from here on out, [Gestures to Wu.] this man has no authority. [Crowd gasps in surprise.]
Wu: Wait, what? But I just got the royal brooch!
Kuvira: [Turns to the crowd again.] I have created a new Earth Empire, and I will continue to lead it into the future myself, bringing about a new era of prosperity for my people.
Crowd: [Cheers and applauds.] We love you, Kuvira! [Shot shows Bolin, with a worried look on his face, as he applauds halfheartedly.] All hail the Great Uniter!
Kuvira: And let me assure my fellow leaders of one thing: [Grabs the medal Wu hung around her neck and pulls it off, breaking the ribbon before letting it hover over her hand.] Anyone who crosses our borders or stands in our way, will be crushed. [Crushes the medal and drops it on the floor.]
Crowd: [Cheering again, the flashbulbs of cameras in the crowd casting erratic shadows on the stage.] Thank you, Kuvira! All hail the Great Uniter!
Wu: [Sighs.] Worst coronation ever.
Cut to the Republic City Four Elements hotel again, where Bolin and Varrick sit in the Presidential Suite.
Bolin: Were you surprised? Because I was really surprised. Won't this turn all the world leaders against us?
Varrick: [Calmly, holding a drink in one hand.] Relax, kid, what can they do? Kuvira controls the whole nation now, and Republic City is begging for the metal that we're mining. This train has left the station, and we own the track!
Zhu Li walks in, followed by a spirit vine on a cart.
Varrick: Now that's a nice looking hunk of spirit vine! Let's take it back to the lab and get it stabilized immediately.
Zhu Li gestures the men pushing the cart to take it away again, and Varrick goes with them. At the same time, Kuvira enters the room, and looks at Bolin, who sits uneasily in his chair, hands folded and head down.
Kuvira: You look worried, Bolin.
Bolin: [Stands up out of his chair.] Yeah, well, I just have some misgivings about how you kind of ambushed Tenzin and the other leaders.
Kuvira: You believe in the work that we've done for the people of the Earth Empire, right, Bolin?
Bolin: I do, but ...
Kuvira: [Interrupts him.] Then stick with me. I'm going to need your help now more than ever. Raiko and the other leaders want to bully us into accepting some idiot king who will serve them but neglect the people. We have to stand strong against them.
Bolin: I'm just not sure about this whole "Empire" thing. It seems pretty aggressive. And what was that part about the crushing?
Kuvira: That was just some ... tough rhetoric to let people know that we mean business. Believe me, [Puts a hand on his shoulder.] conflict is the last thing I want. Will you help me make history, Bolin?
Bolin: [Doubts for a moment.] I'll stand by you.
Kuvira: Thank you.
Suyin walks into the room, drawing the attention of both of them.
Suyin: We need to talk. [Shot pans to her, with an angry expression on her face.]
Kuvira: [To Bolin, who is clearly uncomfortable with Suyin's presence.] Can you give us the room, please? [He walks out.]
Suyin: I met with the world leaders, and I've come as their representative.
Kuvira: So now you're taking an interest in world affairs. A little late, isn't it? When the queen fell, and everyone was asking you to help keep the Earth Kingdom from falling apart, all you wanted to do was hide in Zaofu, and let others deal with the consequences.
Suyin: That's hardly fair. I didn't want to seize power for myself, which is what you've done. I'm telling you for the good of everyone, you have to step down.
Kuvira: I stepped up. I provide stability and equality. Tell your world leaders to stay out of Earth Empire business. We won't accept their hand-picked dictator.
Suyin: What makes you so different? You're just another tyrant. And don't pretend the people put you where you are. I know what happens to cities who don't want to hand over control to you.
Kuvira: Then you know what's coming for Zaofu.
Fade to another room in the hotel.
Wu: First I lose my suite, then I lose my throne. My royal brooch is a lie! [To Mako.] I know you must be crushed, not getting to come back to Ba Sing Se with me.
Mako: [With veiled sarcasm in his voice.] Don't worry about me. I'll ... find a way to make it.
Wu: Good ol' Mako, my big tough guy. [Grunts.] Okay. I just have to go on, move forward, take decisive action. [Jumping to his feet.] Let's go shopping!
Someone knocks on the door, and Mako, opening it, finds Bolin on the other side.
Wu: [Peeking over Mako's shoulder, annoyed and alarmed.] Ugh. Get rid of him. He's with her.
Mako: He's my brother. [Walks out to the hallway.]
Bolin: Interesting ceremony, huh?
Mako: You aren't going to keep working for Kuvira now that she's going against the wishes of the entire world, are you?
Bolin: You don't understand. Kuvira is helping out all the poor people of the Earth Empire. People like our family. This is for the best.
Mako: I don't know, bro.
Bolin: Okay, why don't you come with me, and you'll see for yourself? We've done a lot of good, and Varrick is working on some new innovations. We're making history.
Mako: By "crushing" anyone who gets in your way?
Bolin: [Paraphrasing Kuvira.] That was just some tough rhetoric to let the people know that we mean business. I mean, Kuvira is basically just like Korra. [Mako gets the "raised eyebrow" look on his face.] She might seem hard to deal with, but just because she's so passionate and believes in what she's doing.
Mako: It seems like she's just a dictator who's taking the Earth Kingdom by force.
Bolin: [Aggressive.] Oh, okay, you think your new best friend in there [Points to the door of Wu's suite.] would be a better leader than Kuvira?
Mako: Well, no, but still ...
Bolin: Still what? Come on, Mako! I'm making a difference out there, what are you doing, huh? You're just some glorified butler for some snotty rich bozo!
Cut to Wu on the inside of the door, eavesdropping on the conversation of the bending brothers. He gets agitated at Bolin's remark. Back outside, Bolin walks off.
Mako: I'm sorry, I don't want to work for your glorious emperor and her military dictatorship.
Bolin: [Turns around angrily.] Fine! I'm going to go back to my awesome train, where we bring freedom where ever we go! Enjoy licking the king's boots in your junior suite! [Storms off, leaving a disgruntled Mako in his wake.]
Wu: [Consolingly, as Mako walks back in.] Sorry, sport, I heard it all.
Mako: I can't believe him!
Wu: I know! Insulting another man's suite? It's beneath low. But I think I know what would cheer you up: a visit to Little Ba Sing Se Fashion Mall! I'll buy you a smoothie.
Mako: [Downcast.] Yeah. Okay.
Cut back to the swamp, where Korra and Toph are walking side by side.
Korra: That was terrible.
Toph: Hah! Maybe for you. I had a great time! I never realized how much I missed tormenting the Avatar [Starts picking something out from between her toes.] I wish you were putting up more of a fight, but it was still fun.
Korra: You were tossing me around like a ragdoll all day long.
Toph: I know! And I'm an old lady! Imagine me in my prime! [Laughs.] I would have destroyed you!
Korra: I just don't understand why I can't get back to my former self. It's like ... I'm a step slower. I'm tentative, I'm out of sync, I just can't get back in the groove.
Toph: [Matter-of-factly.] Probably carrying around that metal doesn't help.
Korra: [Suddenly attentive.] What metal?
Toph: The little bits of metal poison stuck in your body. Are you trying to tell me you can't feel metal in your own body? You really are the worst Avatar ever.
Korra: [Shocked.] I thought Su got it all out.
Toph: Oh, my girls never really picked up metalbending all that well, if you ask me.
Korra: [Excitedly climbs the tree root Toph is standing on and grabs her by the shoulders.] That's been my problem this entire time! I gotta get it out! You can get it out for me, right?
Toph: Who do you think you're talking to? [Pushes Korra away.]
Cut to the Little Ba Sing Se Fashion Mall, where Mako and Wu sit drinking smoothies through straws.
Wu: Once we're done with these, we can go into the Middle Ring and I'll let you pick out some new suits, then we'll hit the boutiques in the Upper Ring for me. [Two girls walk by wearing shirts that have the logo of The Metal Clan and Kuvira's face on them. Wu, mentally double-taking, spits his drink onto Mako, scrambling to his feet and dashing after them, angry.] Where did you get those shirts?
Girl #1
Aces, right? Kuvira is my hero.
Girl #2
They're selling them over there.
She points to a store with a large crowd of Kuvira supporters in front of it. Wu pulls his hair in exasperation, squealing, before angrily running toward the shop.
Wu: [To the gathered people.] You can't sell that junk in here! This is the Little Ba Sing Se Fashion Mall, and I'm the Little King here! Respect the brooch!
Crowd: [Begins booing him.] Stop it, Little King!
Wu: [Angry.] I am the Glorious Defender!
Wu throws his smoothie at the group. The sound of the cup hitting something and spilling is heard in the background and the yelling falls momentarily silent.
Crowd: [Off-screen.] I'm covered in juice! Get him!
Mako: We need to get you out of here.
Mako pulls Wu by the arm, while Kuvira's supporters chase them. Mako realizes they can't outrun the group, so he creates a wall of fire behind them, blocking their attackers' path, and pulls Wu behind the wall of a shop, which happens to have a vandalized poster of Wu stuck to it.
Wu: [Gasps.] It's destiny. Look where we are, Mako! The Royal Palace.
Wu runs inside, rudely and haphazardly knocking down the trays of various people as he passes. At the far end of the room, he sees a mock-up of the throne; a little boy sits on it, playing with a fake scepter and a fake crown. Wu approaches and promptly tries to steal the scepter from the child.
Little Boy: Hey! It's my birthday!
Wu: [Wrenches the scepter and the crown away from the boy, also taking the cape from his mother.] It's my coronation day! You'll have another birthday next year, but I'll never have this day back again! Never! [Breaks down into tears.]
Mako: Okay, you're losing it.
Wu: [Bawling.] This is the worst day of my life!
Mako: Why? Do you really want to be the king? I mean, Kuvira might be a power-crazed dictator, but at least she spent the last few years working hard to make the Earth Kingdom somewhat better. If you were an Earth Kingdom citizen, do you think you're the kind of person you want as your king? What have you ever done for your people? [Wu looks at him, and Mako realizes what he just said.] I'm sorry, that was out of line.
Wu: No, you're right. No one ever talked to me like that before. I guess I'm just a joke who got what he deserved.
Mako: [Notices the group that has been chasing them.] Let's get you out of here and back to someplace safe.
Wu: Carry me?
Mako: [Annoyed.] No.
Cut back to Korra and Toph. Korra is lying on a bed, and Toph is leaning over her.
Toph: Okay, if you want me to bend out this metal, you need to relax.
Korra: [Tense.] I am relaxed.
Toph: [Huffing spitefully.] Seriously? Your body is like a twisted tree-trunk!
Korra: Just do it! I'm ready.
Toph cracks her fingers, then her shoulders. The second she starts bending the metal in Korra's body, Korra bolts upright in pain, yelling.
Toph: It wouldn't hurt if you would just relax! Stop fighting me!
Korra: I'm not fighting!
Korra throws herself back onto the bed. Toph cracks her back and starts bending again. This time, Korra gets the visions of Zaheer suffocating her again. She jolts back into reality, screaming.
Toph: [Fed up.] All right, that's it. You're going to have to do this yourself. Clearly, you want to keep the metal in there.
Korra: What do you mean? Why would I want poison inside me?
Toph: I don't know! Maybe so you have an excuse not to go back to being the Avatar. If you don't get better, you can't do your job, so you don't have to worry about getting hurt again!
Korra: Wha‒ That's ridiculous!
Toph: Whatever. When you want it out, you can bend it out. I can't deal with all your issues for you.
Korra: Wait! What am I supposed to do now?
Toph: How should I know? Ask the spirit that brought you here. The good news is, if you're looking for a place to hang where no one will bother you, you picked the best swamp in the world!
Korra lets her head hang. Cut to Air Temple Island.
Tenzin: This ... is a mission of the utmost importance. Conflict is coming to the Earth Kingdom and we need to find the Avatar. [Turns around to face his children.] Can I count on you three to bring Korra home?
Meelo: You can count on one of us. I don't know about these two ladies. [Points to his sisters.]
Cut to Kuvira's train, where Zhu Li puts a part of the spirit vine, wired to electrical connections and suspended in a glass tube, into a machine of sorts as Kuvira and Varrick watch from overhead.
Kuvira: From now on, developing this technology is your number one priority.
Varrick: This is going to change everything!.
End credits.
