JKL: That... was your first lesson. [returns to his hut]
Squidward: What? You call that a lesson? We just stood here and watched you surf for two and a half hours!
JKL: [magically returns to the lagoon, we then see him playing his drums] Just keep breathing.
[The scene cuts to Mr. Krabs sitting on half a surfboard in the middle of the lagoon. He has put a piece of seaweed on the top of his cash register. He has also grown a gray beard] [makes gibberish noises]
Mr. Krabs: [pulls a shell out of the lagoon] Look, Cashy! [breaks the shell in half and connects them to the sides of the seaweed] Earrings! Well, Cashy, I guess the Devil's Galley isn't so bad. As long as that Flying Dutchman doesn’t appear and stick us in Davy Jones' Locker! But that won't happen, will it Cashy? [Cashy's drawer shoots out and hits the Flying Dutchman in the head who's flying by]
Flying Dutchman: Ow!
Mr. Krabs: Arrrgh! It's the Flying Dutchman!
Flying Dutchman: [drops his groceries] Aaahhh! It's some guy I've never seen before! Argh! Who be disturbing the Flying Dutchman's walk home from the convenience store? You even spilled me milk!
Mr. Krabs: Well, there ain't no use crying over it. [Lightning bolts shoot everywhere] Yah! Don't worry, Cashy! I’ll protect ye!
[The scene cuts to the island where SpongeBob and his friends are. They are sitting around a fire]
SpongeBob: Isn't Jack Kahuna Laguna the most totally awesome surf guru you've ever met, Squidward?
Squidward: I don't know about you two, but I'd like to get out of here at some point, and if his idea of teaching us is...
[JKL walks by the fire and sits down with his drums]
Squidward: [sarcastic] Oh, wonderful.
SpongeBob: Quiet, Squidward! I think we're about to receive another lesson.
JKL: [plays his drums. Eventually, he stops, lifts his hands to the air, then plays the drums again] Just... keep breathing. [returns to his hut]
Squidward: That's it?! I just wanna go home! [buries his head in his lap]
SpongeBob: Would it make you feel better if I went and talked to him?
Squidward: Oh, thank you. Thank you, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob walks away, then immediately returns] Well, did you talk to him?
SpongeBob: Yup.
Squidward: And?
SpongeBob: He said we just have to stare into this fire all night, and the secrets will be revealed.
Squidward: We're gonna be stuck here forever!
[The scene cuts to Sandy's island]
Sandy: Well, Sandy, using only your bare hands and the resources found on this deserted island, you have not only survived, but thrived. You've built a five star hotel, a steam-powered generator, a car that runs on coconut milk, and even a espresso bar. I almost don't wanna leave. But I miss Bikini Bottom. Now I can find SpongeBob and the gang and fly us right back. [climbs into and activates her helicopter] Acorn 1 to Tower. Request clearance.
Dennis: Roger, Acorn 1. You are clear for take-off.
[Sandy flies away. The scene cuts to Mr. Krabs, the Flying Dutchman, and Cashy]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman! I didn't mean to spill your groceries!
Flying Dutchman: Well, normally, I wouldn't mind, but I'm a little low on cash this month, and I have no way to pay for more. Unless you have some money I can borrow.
Mr. Krabs: No, I... [Dutchman grabs Cashy] Cashy! Please! Cashy is the closest thing to a friend I've ever had!
[The scene cuts to one of the islands. A wave washes up on Squidward]
Squidward: Oh, oh. Please tell me you two didn't stare into that fire all night.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [tired from staring all night] Okay...
Squidward: All right, I'm done! Hey, blondey! Teach me how to surf so I can go home, or I'm gonna...
JKL: You obviously didn't stare into the fire all night like your friends over there.
[SpongeBob and Patrick are knocked out]
JKL: Those dudes are gonna make awesome surfers. [A storm of lightning starts. JKL runs away]
SpongeBob: Where's he going?! Come on! [chases after JKL. Patrick and Squidward follow SpongeBob. SpongeBob and Patrick are running, but Squidward is walking. SpongeBob and Patrick climb up a cliff]
SpongeBob: [gets shocked by lightning] [screams] Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
Patrick: Look! He's on top of that big... drinking fountain!
[Squidward climbs the cliff. SpongeBob and Patrick climb the pyramid. Squidward follows]
SpongeBob: JKL! Is this the next part of our training?
JKL: [hands in the air. He says this in a strange, echoing voice] Uh...
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: [screaming in some way]
JKL: These clouds. They can only mean one thing.
Patrick: Increased chance of precipitation? [it starts raining]
JKL: Yes. Every thousand years or so, the planets align in such a way that a perfect wave is formed.
SpongeBob: A perfect wave?
JKL: The world's biggest, fastest, longest, gnarliest, most totally awesome, perfect wave. They call it.... the Big One.
Patrick: Hey, that's what they used to call me!
JKL: It's probably the only wave big enough for you to ride all the way back to Bikini Bottom. You'll have to catch it, or you'll be stuck here... forever. [Huge lightning bolts flash] The Big One is almost upon us.
[The scene cuts to Mr. Krabs and the Flying Dutchman fighting over Cashy]
Mr. Krabs: Please! Please, Mr. Dutchman! Let Cashy go! I promise I'll never soil your waters again!
Flying Dutchman: Ya promise?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yes. I promise on my dear Aunt Sally's false teeth.
Flying Dutchman: [angry] Liar! [Huge lightning bolts flash. Storm clouds hover and waves emerge from the lagoon]
Mr. Krabs: What?
Flying Dutchman: Your Aunt Sally doesn't wear false teeth!
Mr. Krabs: How do you know?
Flying Dutchman: Because I dated her in high school!
Mr. Krabs: [Gasp!] No! [Dutchman takes Cashy]
Flying Dutchman: Whoops! [accidentally throws Cashy]
Sandy: This weather sure is dangerous! I better be careful! [Cashy hits the helicopter's windshield] May Day! May Day! I'm going down! Repeat: Down!
Flying Dutchman: And now, just to make sure this never happens again, I'm gonna send you on a little trip down the- [Sandy's helicopter hits him in the head] -Ooh ow, ooh ow! Ooh!
Mr. Krabs: Uh... where is that, exactly? [Dutchman lands on him. They both plunge into the lagoon]
Sandy: [spinning out of control] May Day!
Mr. Krabs: [pops up from the lagoon] Oh, all alone again. [Cashy pops up from the lagoon] Cashy!
Flying Dutchman: [lands at the bottom of the lagoon. A sock lands on his face] Oh, what the... a tube sock? But that means...
Davy Jones: Yeah, that's right, baby! Welcome... to my locker! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! ♪For a day-dream believer and a homecoming queen!♪ [throws a sock at the Flying Dutchman. That same song plays. The scene cuts to Kahmamoku Cove]
JKL: Get ready, dudes. It's coming.
SpongeBob: JKL, thanks for teaching us how to surf.
JKL: Little dude, I didn't teach you anything you didn't already know.
Squidward: Here it comes!
SpongeBob: Well, JKL, I guess this is good-bye.
JKL: Wait. There's something I forgot to tell you. In return for its awesomeness, the Big One always demands a sacrifice. And one of you... will not return.
Squidward: I volunteer SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward surf toward the Big One]
SpongeBob: Keep paddling, Patrick!
Patrick: This wind feels like broken glass mixed with razor blades!
SpongeBob: It's... the Big One!
Big One: Ha ha ha ha ha! [grabs Patrick's surfboard]
Patrick: No!
Big One: [puts salt on the surfboard and takes a bite of it] Errrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggg!
Patrick: Hey, I was gonna eat that!
SpongeBob: Patrick, grab on!
Big One: [stares at Squidward]
Squidward: [panics] Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! [jumps on SpongeBob and Patrick's surfboard]
SpongeBob: Hang on, Squidward! This is it!
Patrick: Time for those lessons to pay off!
Squidward: Look! That's Mr. Krabs down there!
Mr. Krabs: You like it when I comb your hair, don't ya, Cashy?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! Hop on or you'll be stuck here forever!
Mr. Krabs: Who said that? [gets buried by the Big One]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! I never even got a chance to tell him that I...
JKL: [on his huge surfboard] Looking for this?
SpongeBob: JKL! And Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: And Cashy! [jumps on the other surfboard. Then, he drops Cashy] Cashy!
[JKL dives off his surfboard]
SpongeBob: JKL!
[Cashy lands in the Big One's mouth. JKL follows]
SpongeBob: No!
JKL: Little dude... I was born to do this. [winks, waves good-bye, and is swallowed]
Big One: [burps]
Squidward: I guess the Big One prefers a high-protein meal.
Patrick: Now what are we gonna do?
SpongeBob: [plays JKL's drums. The storm clouds clear away and reveals a picture of JKL's face. The scene cuts to Goo Lagoon, where Nat and Shubie are lying on beach towels]
Nat: You hear a noise?
[Sandy crashes down in her helicopter]
Lifeguard: Everybody, look! A You-foe! [meaning UFO]
Jimmy-Gus: A spaceman!
Harold\Bill: [holding a pitchfork] Don't make any funny moves, spaceman! You're not conquering our world without a fight!
Sandy: [slaps the pitchfork] I'm not a spaceman, you dunder-head! It's me, Sandy! SpongeBob's friend.
Beach goers: [act bored]
Sandy: Shucks. Now I'll never find SpongeBob and Patrick.
Gus: Who?
Sandy: My friends. They went surfing and never returned.
Gus: Is one of them, like, a little square dude with big teeth?
Sandy: You some kinda mind-reader?
Gus: No. [points at SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs]
People: Welcome home! [cheering]
SpongeBob: Hey, Twitch!
Twitch: [twitches] Grab a guitar, dude! Let's party!
Big G: [coughs. Then, music starts]
Patrick: I love this song!
Mr. Krabs: [laughs]
Squidward: Look!
[JKL surfs in on a giant wave]
SpongeBob: JKL!
JKL: Just keep breathing. [holds up Cashy]
Mr. Krabs: Cashy!
SpongeBob: Turn it up, Chip! [Chip plays his saxophone harder. The episode ends with everyone dancing at the beach.]
