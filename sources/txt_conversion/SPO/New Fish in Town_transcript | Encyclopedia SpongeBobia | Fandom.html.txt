Squidward: [starts with showing SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward's houses] It's finally complete! [shows Squidward in his house at a table] After weeks and weeks of burning the candle at both ends, [voice calms down] literally, [a double-sided, burned candle is shown, and his voice returns in a louder tone] my first clarinet concerto is complete and ready to be performed! [falls at a quake, and his clarinet concerto papers fall in the fire of the double-sided candle] No! [now quaked again] Now, I'm flummoxed. [opens his front door, and he hits his head four times as he yells "Doh, doh, doh, doh." SpongeBob and Patrick are shown hammering a "For Rent" sign]
SpongeBob: Hit it one more time Patrick. Don't want anyone stealing it. [Patrick hammers the sign into the ground, and it is destroyed to pieces] Perfect. [claps his hands.]
SpongeBob: Good job, Patrick.
Squidward: [grunts angrily] All right, what's going on out here? I can't even hear myself think!
Patrick: [raises his hand] Oh! Ooh! Can you smell yourself think?
Squidward: [calmly] No. [raises his voice] As I was saying, you two... [Patrick interrupts]
Patrick: Or see?
Squidward: No!
Patrick: [screams] How, how about taste? Can you taste yourself think?
Squidward: Shut it! What are you two dingbats doing?
SpongeBob: We were just posting Patrick's new "For Rent" sign. We worked on it all morning, see? [the sign is shown]
Squidward: For rent? You mean one of you is moving out?
SpongeBob: [laughs] No, Patrick here is just gonna rent out his front yard.
Patrick: Need a little extra cash if you know what I mean.
Squidward: Wow! To think this day started off so horribly and now... What do you mean you're just gonna rent out your front yard?
Patrick: First come, first, serve.
Squidward: Oh great, now another idiot can move in.
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, that reminds me. Patrick and I are off to Jellyfish Fields for the day. We were wondering if maybe you can stick around and keep an eye out for any takers.
Squidward: Oh, I would love to. Just let me check my planner. [takes out his planner and looks in it]
SpongeBob: Oh, thanks!
Squidward: Oh no, I'm sorry, I can't.
SpongeBob: Aww, why not?
Squidward: It's because I was planning to do "No such thing"! See?
SpongeBob: Oh, well thanks anyway, Squidward.
Patrick: Yeah, thanks. [Bubble transition]
Squidward: With those two bone bags gone, I now have enough time for some peace and... [everything shakes] ...quiet. [walks outside] Now what are those two boobs up to? I thought you guys were... [SpongeBob and Patrick are not there] Hmmm. I wonder who was making all that noise.
Howard: Hello. My name is Howard.
Squidward: Hello, Howard.
Howard: I noticed this "For Rent" sign. Is this yard still for rent?
Squidward: Sorry, you're too late.
Howard: Hmmm. Howard is disappointed.
Squidward: Aren't we all?
Howard: I thought this would be the one place to pursue my passions...
Squidward: [peeks out the door] Passions?
Howard: ...play the bassoon...
Squidward: The bassoon?
Howard: ...and enjoy a nice cup of tea in my front yard.
Squidward: [speaks gibberish] I can't believe what I am hearing. [sighs] Finally, a neighbor that has it! I can only imagine! Painting portraits while sipping tea, recumbent bicycling into a museum, and performing a duet at the Bikini Bottom concert! [sighs again]
Howard: [leaves] Farewell. I new this was too good to be true.
Squidward: [stops him] Wait! Don't go! [panting] I was...just kidding!
Howard: Well, in that case, I should move in right away! [invites Squidward] Make yourself at home.
Squidward: Wow, his designs are impeccable! [to Howard] Yes, I do feel "at home".
Howard: I would like to propose a toast—to a new neighbor.
Squidward: To a new neighbor! [they both drink tea]
Howard: While we're on the topic, what are the other neighbors like?
Squidward: [nervous] Oh! Well, they're just like any other neighbors.
Howard: That's neat. I'm the neighbor that likes all kinds of neighbors!
Squidward: Well, that's nice!
Howard: Well, as long they aren't jellyfishers. [Squidward nearly chokes on his tea] I can't stand anyone who jellyfishes. But, luckily, they're not the worst kind of neighbor.
Squidward: Well, that's nice.
Howard: That would be the bubble blowers. [Squidward spits out his tea] Between the jellyfishers and the bubble blowers, I just couldn't stand to stay in my old neighborhood anymore.
Squidward: Well, you won't even notice what the neighbors around here are like! [looks out the window. SpongeBob and Patrick return from jellyfishing and notice the trailer]
Patrick: SpongeBob, look! There's a mobile home parked in front of my house!
SpongeBob: Do you know what that means?
Patrick: I'm a landlord!
SpongeBob and Patrick: All hail the landlord! [laughter]
Patrick: SpongeBob, what do you say we go knock on the door and meet the new neighbor?
SpongeBob: Great idea.
Squidward: Oh no!
Howard: What's going on? Is someone out there?
Squidward: [closes the curtains] Nope, no! There's nobody at all for miles around!
Howard: Are you sure? I thought I heard voices.
Squidward: Nope, there weren't any voices.
Howard: Perhaps it's the other neighbors coming to meet me. We'd better check.
Squidward: No! I can't let you do that!
Howard: [chuckles] Well, of course you can. They're your neighbors, too.
Squidward: No! You REALLY don't wanna go out there, trust me! [jerks on Howard's arm harder and harder]
Howard: You're hurting my arm!
Squidward: [lets go] Oh, sorry. I was just wondering if we could...
Howard: Could, what?
Squidward: Um, form a little duet together. Just you and me. Just the two of us. Together. You know, me on clarinet and you on bassoon.
Howard: Why, that's a splendid idea. I'll get some sheet music.
Squidward: Wonderful! [looks through the curtains]
Patrick: Hey, Did you see the way those curtains jerked shut?
SpongeBob: Yeah. Our new neighbor must be really shy.
Patrick: Maybe we could just came back and meet him later.
SpongeBob: Yeah, besides, we have more pressing things to attend to—like this jellyfish we've befriended and this brand new bottle of bubbles!
Squidward: Phew! That was close.
Howard: And a one and a two... [they both olay on their instruments]
Squidward: [thinking] Squiddy, this is absolutely the best day of your life! [SpongeBob and Patrick are heard laughing]
Howard: Perplexing. I could've sworn I just had this thing tuned.
Squidward: Uh, that's me! I think this reed needs replacing. Excuse me for a moment! [runs and builds a fence around Howard's house] There! Now, where were we?
Patrick: Look! Our new neighbor must be even shyer than we thought!
SpongeBob: Yeah. [a bubble pops and a jellyfish stings Patrick. They both laugh]
Howard: There it is again.
Squidward: [laughs nervously] Excuse me one more time! [builds a wall of cinder blocks as more laughing is heard.] Just a second. [runs outside and paints zippers on SpongeBob and Patrick's mouths] Now, uh... where were we? [SpongeBob and Patrick unzip the zippers and laugh. Squidward climbs in a bulldozer and pushes SpongeBob and Patrick's houses off a cliff. SpongeBob and Patrick run after them and jump off the cliff. Squidward then comes back inside] I'm back.
Howard: [angrily] What is going on? Are you hiding something?
Squidward: [nervously] Why, Howard, I would never hide anything from you!
Howard: Stand aside! [SpongeBob and Patrick are shown jellyfishing and blowing bubbles] Repulsive! Somebody's got to stop these bubble blowing jellyfishers!
Squidward: [crying] WAIT! Please, Howard, don't go! You're the rain of sunshine I've had in years!
Howard: I'm sorry. It's too late, Mr. Tentacles!
Squidward: Oh, Neptune, no!
Howard: [to SpongeBob and Patrick] You there! [pops a bubble] Hey! That was actually kind of fun! Maybe it's time I stop being so stuffy and loosened up for a change! [joins in on the fun]
Squidward: I know I can handle two dunderheads, but I draw the line at three! [knocks out the brick and Howard's trailer rolls away]
Howard: My house! [runs after it and jumps off the cliff] I knew it was too good to be true.
Squidward: [sadly as he holds a piece of the broken sign] Well, I almost had a decent neighbor.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. We can cheer you up. [blows a bubble]
Patrick: Go on. Pop it!
Squidward: Pop it? Me? Well at this point, what have I got to lose? [bubble floats away] Hey, come back here, you bubble! [bubble floats over the same cliff and Squidward jumps off of it] Jellyfishing bubble blowers!
