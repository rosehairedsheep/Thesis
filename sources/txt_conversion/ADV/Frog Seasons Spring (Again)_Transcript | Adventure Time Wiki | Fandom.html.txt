[The screen opens on the newly green mountain from Frog Seasons: Winter, but pans down to show Finn and Jake gliding down a  shimmering river (Jake is stretched out like a canoe, which Finn is sitting in).]
Finn:  Hey, Jake, what do you think this river is made of?
Jake:  Man, I don't even want to know.
Finn:  Then why'd you put your face in it?
Jake:  'Cause I'm the figurehead!
Finn:  So then LSP was all, "Get out of my kitchen, Finn". "Exactly what part of this forest is your kitchen?" I says, and she was all, "I dunno how big is this forest?"
[Finn and Jake laugh, and Jake bumps into Breezy.]
Breezy:  Oh!
Jake:  Whoops, sorry Breezy. Didn't see you there.
Breezy:  That's ok, Jake. Your head is surprisingly soft!
Jake:  That's my sweet neckroll. [Jake shows bumps on his neck, similar to a triple-chin] Wababababababa! [Jake jiggles his neckroll]
Finn:  So what are you doing in the river, bee?
Breezy:  I'm panning for gold.
Finn and Jake:  Gold?!
Breezy:  Gold!
Finn:  Are you deckin' out the hive?
Breezy:  Don't be silly, Finn. It's for Honey Man. [Honey Man is seen with his honey sticking to the grass] Hey, would you guys like to help?
Finn and Jake:  Yes we would!
Jake:  [Finn and Jake are seen panning for gold] Hey, Finn, you know what? This all panned out pretty good.
Finn:  Man that joke was... [Finn lifts up a handful of gold] Gold! [Jake laughs] Are you impressed by my brilliant nugget?
Finn: [Breezy walks over to the Honey Man and puts gold in his hands.] Hang on there's more! Here you go, big guy. [Finn puts his gold in the Honey Man's hands]
Jake:  Bling! [Jake throws his gold into the Honey Man's hands]
[The Honey Man pours the gold into the top of his head.]
Finn and Jake:  Woah!
[The Honey Man begins spinning and dancing, causing his honey to fly everywhere.]
Finn and Jake:  Wow- eewww. [they are impressed until the honey lands all over them]
Breezy:  Yeah, this isn't even the best part!
[The Honey Man continues to dance, and his honey lands on all the plants, making them bloom. The Honey Man then spits a crown into his hands.]
Finn:  Sweet crown, man.
Jake:  Hmm, I could swear I've seen that crown before. [the frog walks by and picks up the crown, causing Finn and Jake to gasp]
Finn:  Jake, we've gotta follow that frog. [they run away] Bye, Breezy! So what do you think will happen when he puts on that crown?
Jake:  Maybe he'll turn into a time vortex.
[Finn laughs and pushes back a branch as he walks past. When he lets go, the honey on the leaf flies into the air, lands on a flower, and causes it to bloom.]
