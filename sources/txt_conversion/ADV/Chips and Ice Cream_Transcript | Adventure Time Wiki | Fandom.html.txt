[The audience of rabbits walks towards their mother leaving only BMO.]

BMO: Dinner?[Runs to Finn and Jake. Slides on their knees and puts their arms in a pleading gesture] Please can we invite him to dinner?
Jake: No.
BMO: But, Jake, I never ask you for anything. When did I ever ask you for anything?
BMO: Yesterday. You said, [[Imitating BMO]] "Jake, please take me to see Chips and Ice Cream! It's a Broadway smash!" And I believed you.
BMO: [Crying.] You don't understand me, Jake.
Morty Rogers: [Rubs two coins together and sighs.]
BMO: [Pokes Morty Rogers on the shoulder.] Please come over for dinner! I love you! [Squeals.]
Morty Rogers: Yeah. Dinner sounds great! [Chuckles.] Yeah! Wait. The place where you eat dinner, does the moon shine through the window at night?
Finn: Sure.
Morty Rogers: All right! Let's do it!

[The scene cuts to Finn and Jake's Tree Fort at night]

BMO: Oh, ooh! And when Chips trips over the turtle, it was so funny! But also sad. It made me think about the fragility of my own life.
Morty Rogers: [Looks out the window to the clouds covering the moon.] Just a little more...
Jake: [Holds up rice patties and a dead fish] Hey, y'all ready for some sushi burgers?
Morty Rogers: Mm, I don't eat burgers. Got any chips and ice cream?

Morty Rogers: [Stands from his seat.] By the light of the waxing moon, which was just unveiled by the parting clouds, I command these two imps that have taken possession of my ears to transfer onto the head of the being who is directly across from me [Steps forwards and aligns his shadow with Jake's]and is currently eating chips and ice cream!

[A blue light ray hits Morty Rogers' ears where Chips and Ice Cream are. Chips and Ice Cream become specters, float towards Jake and sit on his head. They form new ears onto of his head.]

John: Tremendous.
Morty Rogers: [Runs and pants. Enters his home.] No more chips. No more ice cream. [Cuts open a can of beans.] Beans. That's what regular-sized-ear folks eat. Regular old morty Rogers... [Looks at a tub of ice cream and a bag of chips. Screams.] [Groans and shuffles. Grabs a record and plays it on the record player.]

[Chips and Ice Cream respond to BMO at the same time.]]

BMO: [Nods.] I know what we have to do.

[Scene change to Morty Rogers' house.]

Morty Rogers: [Emerges from a barrel of chips and ice cream holding a mirror.] How many years did I search for a rube to take my burden? [Touches one of his ears.] What's wrong with me? You two brought me nothing but pain... [Rubs one ear gently.] And I can't stop thinking of you. But I don't want you back! [Presses the mirror to his face.] I don't want you!
[Chips and Ice Cream's song heard in the distance.]

Morty Rogers: [Glances around.] What's that? [Looks at the mirror.] Do you hear that? [Drops the mirror.]
