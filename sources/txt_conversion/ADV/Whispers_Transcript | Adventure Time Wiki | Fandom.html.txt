[The episode opens with Finn and Fern fishing in a river together. Finn puts a gummy worm on his fish hook]
Finn: Squish.
Fern: Photosynthesize! Photosynthesize! Photo-
Finn: You grabbing a snack, Fern?
Fern: Yeah. Water and light combine so I can make my own food. In case I don't catch anything.
Finn: Come on, man, don't be so dow- [Gasps] Hey, I got something!
Fern: Hey, I got something too!
[Finn is first to reel in his catch. It is a beautiful golden fish.]
Fern: Nice.
[Fern reels in his own catch. It is an evil-looking creature which growls and snaps its jaws at him.]
Fern: Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
[Fern throws the entire fishing rod into the river and sighs. Finn hands him his own fishing rod.]
Finn: Pretty weird fish, huh?
Fern: That's me - the dude who dinks it up, just like I dinked it up when you left Ooo. I was supposed to protect it. Instead, it went all crazy. I didn't even help. I just covered myself in root beer and danced around like a dummy. I can't do anything right!
[While he is talking, flashbacks are seen to the elemental purification of Ooo.]
Finn: Hey, stop it. You need a squoze?
Fern: Yes.
[Finn squeezes Fern tightly.]
Fern: I feel better.
Finn: Sometimes being a good dude ain't about not dinking it. Learn from your dinks. Like, you know my first battle with a giant? I never told anybody this, but-
Fern: You boom-boomed in your shorts. I know. I have your memories.
Finn: Yeah, I boom-boomed. The point is I learned from it, and now I'm Finn. You got to learn how to be Fern.
[They hear a stomping coming from the trees.]
Finn and Fern: [Together] What's that sound?
Finn: Oh, I bet it's a monster. Let's fight this dude Fern's way.
Fern: [Drawing his sword] Yeah. Fern's way.
[Sweet P emerges from the treeline, screaming.]
Finn and Fern: [Together] Sweet P? [They both grab his leg as he passes.] Whoa!
[Sweet P runs straight through the river, dragging the two of them underwater and then up onto the opposite bank. They both climb further up Sweet P's body, who continues wailing the whole time.]
Finn: Okay, Fern, what do you think we should do next?
Fern: Mm, sever his tendons? [Draws his sword again.]
Finn: [Winces]
Fern: Before you say no, it would stop him from running.
Finn: We're gonna handle this librarian style. [Finn climbs up to Sweet P's head and whispers to him.] Shh. Librarian. [Kisses him.] Kiss. You can renew the book and bring it back next week.
Fern: [Quietly] Library style. Squo-o-oze.
[Fern hugs Sweet P tightly. He finally calms down, stops, and takes a seat on the floor.]
Sweet P: Mm.
Finn: Great thinking, Fern.
Fern: I just copied you. Is that thinking?
Finn: [Talking to Sweet P] What up, buttercup? Why you run, pork bun?
Sweet P: The monster!
Finn: Was it LSP?
Sweet P: [Shakes his head] The monster that whispers me bad thoughts.
[A flashback is shown. Sweet P is lying in bed. An indistinct whispering can be heard. Sweet P thinks he sees a monster at the end of his bed, and sits up screaming.]
Sweet P: [Narrating] Mommy and Daddy came to save me, but they said I was imagining things, which was true.
[Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig enter the room, remove the coat which Sweet P mistook for a monster, and put him back to bed. The indistinct whispering continues.]
Sweet P: [Narrating] But last night, I really did see it.
[Something scuttles across Sweet P's roof. He screams and runs out the house. The flashback ends.]
Sweet P: And I've been running and running since then.
Finn: Aww, Sweet P. It sounds like you might just be having bad dreams.
Sweet P: No, I only have one dream anymore.
[An image of the Lich is shown while the whispering continues.]
Finn: Uhh...
Fern: Uhh...
Sweet P: But the whisper monster is even scarier, saying stuff like, "Sweet P, you're bad. You always have been bad." I don't want to be bad. [He starts crying.]
Finn: Oh, you're not bad. You're super good. Now, let's get you home.
Fern: But it's getting late, and bogs are super dangerous to travel in at night. Your body will be preserved for thousands of years. No one will ever find you.
Sweet P: [Wailing]
Finn: Fern!
[The sun sets. Finn is on the phone to Tree Trunks.]
Finn: Okay, okay, we'll see you in the morning, Tree Trunks. [He hangs up.] All right, bedtime, Sweet P.
Fern: You want me to knock him out?
Finn: Er, not this time. How about a bedtime story?
Sweet P: Yes, please.
Finn: Once there was a kingdom of spaghetti.
Sweet P: Mmm.
[The scene cuts to later in the night. Finn, Fern, and Sweet P are all asleep.]
Finn: [Whispering in his sleep.] Punch, punch. Kiss, kiss.
Mysterious voice: Listen to your bones.
[Finn wakes up.]
Finn: [Whispering] Fern.
[Fern is grinding his teeth in his sleep.]
Finn: [Whispering] Fern!
[Fern awakens suddenly, waving his sword in the air with a gasp, then putting it away and sitting up.]
Fern: Hey. What's up?
Finn: [Whispering] I heard something. Can you see what it is with your tree senses?
Fern: I don't have those.
[They hear a rustling. Finn pulls out a torch and sweeps the treeline. He spots Mr. Fox walking with some grocery bags.]
Mr. Fox: Uh, can I help you?
Finn: Oh, sorry. We heard you scuttling around and thought-
Mr. Fox: What? You didn't hear me "scuttling around." Foxes are silent hunters. I mean, geez, do you know how rude that is? Ugh. Gonna be brooding about this all week.
Finn: Sorry, man.
Fern: Look.
[Finn shines the torch on Sweet P. A giant yellow hand-shaped creature is standing above him, whispering indistinctly.]
Finn: Aah! Get off him!
[Finn draws his sword and charges at the creature.]
Hand creature: Huh?
[The creature punches Finn and tries to escape. It is pinned by Fern.]
Fern: I got him!
Finn: Oh, no. I know where I've seen that thing before.
[A flashback is shown to the events in Farmworld, when Finn severed the Lich's hand and caused it to be duplicated across every dimension in the Multiverse. One of the duplicates appears inside the Tree House where it falls onto BMO.]
BMO: Huh?
Lich Hand: [Laughs evilly and jumps through a window]
[Finn and Jake teleport back from the Time Room.]
BMO: Finn, Jake!
Jake: What's shaking?
BMO: You will not believe what just happened.
[The flashback ends.]
Finn: It must've been the day that BMO found that little sailor hat. Hold him down, Fern! That hand is the flippin' Lich!
Fern: I know.
Lich Hand: [Chuckles evilly] Yes, child. I have returned once more to-
Finn: Bah! Bah! Bah! Bah! Evil! You're gonna get it for messing with our boy Sweet P.
Lich Hand: That vessel may appear harmless, but he came from me. Once I remind him of his legacy, The Lich shall reign once more. Isn't that right, son?
[Sweet P grabs Finn from behind, his eyes glowing a radioactive green.]
Finn: Aah!
Fern: Finn!
[The Lich Hand break's out of Fern's grip and scuttles away, laughing evilly.]
Fern: Ugh! I dinked it again!
[Sweet P is released from his trance. He lets go of Finn, who bends over panting.]
Sweet P: Why did Mr. Hand call me "son"? Was that my monster daddy?
Finn: Okay, delegate, delegate - Fern, stay here and guard Sweet P. I'm gonna try and catch up.
Fern: Don't trust me to guard anything. I'm a total scrub-up.
[Finn grabs Fern by the shoulders.]
Finn: [Quietly] Dude, there's already one Lich loose in Ooo. If Sweet P turns E-V-I-L tonight, there might be a second. I need you here. [He draws his sword and departs in pursuit of the Lich.] You got this!
Fern: [To himself] You got this.
The Lich (speaking through Sweet P): Quickly, while the boy is gone, we must seek out my Well of Power.
Sweet P: [Normal voice] No! Am I turning into a monster?
Fern: That's the working theory.
[The Lich Hand arrives at the Well of Power and enters through the subway entrance. Finn is on the phone as he chases.]
Jake: [From the phone] I can't come to the phone right now. I'm either hanging with Finn, my kids, my GF, or I'm dead. Bye! [Tone]
Finn: Hey man, hit me when you get this. [He hangs up and tuts.] Dude's missing a Lich fight. [He arrives at the subway entrance.] Okay, Lich. Get ready to die. Again. For, like, the fifth time!
[Finn enters the station.]
Finn: Oh, hey, it's this awful place.
[He spots the Lich Hand scuttling across the platform.]
Finn: Oh, you're tricky, huh?
[Finn follows the Lich Hand into a hole. He gracefully jumps from pipe to pipe, all the way to the bottom where the Well of Power lies. Indistinct whispering can be heard coming from it.]
Finn: I can hear you down there! Speak up, man. What?
[The Lich Hand rushes Finn from behind and bats him. He drops his sword and then falls into the well. He manages to grip the very edge and avoids falling all the way in. The well fills with bright green sludge.]
Lich Hand: [Chuckles evilly] You've bested me in many worlds, child, but I always return.
[The Lich Hand begins flicking at Finn's fingers, loosening his grip on the edge of the well.]
Finn: You're so evil it's boring. You're basic, man.
Lich Hand: Yes. While a mortal world doubts and questions, I know exactly what I am. I am the ceaseless wheel. The last scholar of GOLB. I am your doom.
[From Finn's perspective, only the Hand's shadow can be seen, projected onto the ceiling by the green light of the well. The shadow grows and morphs as the Lich speaks, taking on his original humanoid figure. Suddenly, Sweet P's voice is heard.]
Sweet P: Skull man!
The Lich: Huh?
Sweet P: I, too, am doom.
[Sweet P leaps down the hole from above, smashing most of the pipes and landing with a thud at the bottom. His shadow joins that of the Lich, projected on the ceiling.]
Finn: Hey, what's going on up there?
The Lich: [Laughs evilly] Child, you have failed. The vessel has turned. We reign now as twin kings of ruin.
Finn: Sweet P...
Sweet P: I'm not a king of ruin.
The Lich: What?
Sweet P: I am sweet. You're just a naughty hand.
The Lich: Beast, obey me! Obey- No!
[Sweet P tackles The Lich. The shadows fall out of Finn's view. He manages to regain his grip and climb up from the well, just in time to see that Sweet P has plunged Finn's sword into the Lich Hand.]
Finn: Eesh.
[With a groan, the Lich Hand bursts into a cloud of green faces like those produced by the Mushroom Bomb, which dissipate away. The liquid in the well recedes.]
Sweet P: Hooray!
Finn: You're a natural! But where's Fern?
Sweet P: He wouldn't let me follow you, so I knocked him out cold.
[The scene changes. Sweet P and Finn approach Fern, who is lying unconscious on the ground. He wakes up as they arrive.]
Finn: Yeah, I met my bio-dad once too. He wasn't evil incarnate, but he was kind of a crummy dude. TT and Mr. P love you. That's all that matters. Fern! Sweet P saved me and slew The Lich!
Fern: [Exasperated] That's great.
[Back at the Tree House, Jake is listening to Finn's voicemail. It turns out Finn forgot to hang up.]
Sweet P: [On voicemail] You're just a naughty hand.
The Lich: [On voicemail] Beast, obey me! Obey- No!
Automated voice: End of message. To repeat this message, press 7. To save...
Jake: Wha...?
[The scene changes back to Finn, Fern, and Sweet P, who are walking home together.]
Fern: [Thinking to himself] I don't get it. Why isn't it working out being myself? Finn's off having fun defeating losers. I can't even guard a baby.
[The inside of Fern's head is shown. The Grass Demon is latched to his inner self like a parasite.]
Fern: [Thinking to himself] It doesn't matter how hard I try. I'll always just be in the shadow of the real Finn. Unless I could become... [Out loud] the only Finn.
Finn: Uh, yeah, but that's a weird thing to call me.
[Fern shapeshifts his arm to take on Finn's skin tone, and pretends to crush Finn's head between his finger and thumb.]
