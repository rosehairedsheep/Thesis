[The short begins with Princess Bubblegum in her cabin.]
[PB sits in front of petri dish and baking tray. She pulls microscopic nanite out of the petri dish with tweezers]
Princess Bubblegum: No more luddite. I've got nanite.
[PB moves nanite over to muffin tin.]
Princess Bubblegum: I hope muffins aren't easy to make or I'm being an idiot.
[Through the view of the microscope: PB places down the nanite. The microscope zooms in and blurs, and then refocuses on the nanite. PB opens a hatch in the nanite with the tweezers. The lens turns, and focuses on a microscopic muffin recipes, which PB then stuffs into the nanite. The nanite doubles, then quadruples.]
[No longer through the view of the microscope: A muffin pop into existence in the muffin tray.]
Princess Bubblegum: [PB takes off her goggles] Nanites!
[5 more muffins pop into the tray]
Princess Bubblegum: Wait. Hold it.
[The muffin tray turns into a pile of muffins]
Princess Bubblegum: Stop making muffins!!! [Points at the muffins, touching them] Nanite, stop!
[Most of PB's arm turns into muffins]
Princess Bubblegum: Aaaah! [She looks at her arm stub] Aaaah!
[The desk turns into a pile of muffins. PB, now outside, watches as her cabin turns into muffins.]
[A duck flies onto the muffin pile, takes a bite, and then transforms into muffins.]
[PB takes out her phone, and starts dialing.] Ah, c'mon, c'mon. [She stretches out her arm stub, starting to reform her arm.]
Jake: [Looks at Finn and sighs, then answers the ringing phone.] Hello. What's shakin'?
Princess Bubblegum: [Reshaping her fingers.] Jake, it's Bonnie. Can you dudes get over here? I need your help with a catastrophe.
Jake: Ehh, I dunno. Finn's got rat germs all through his body.
Finn: [groans] I'll do it.
[Jake, shaped like a stretcher, carries Finn to Bonnie. Finn stumbles up, and groans.]
Princess Bubblegum: You up to this, champ? [Finn coughs] Ok, well, it's pretty complicated. Firstly, you need to not touch the muffins, especially with your unprotected skin. And you need to find the alpha nanite and deactivate it before the muffin pestilence grey goos all the way to the edge of the continent.
Finn: Yup. [Exits, breathing heavily.]
Jake: Brave little soldier, up on muffin hill.
[Finn stumbles towards the hill, breathing heavily. He lets out a dry cough, and wipes away his snot. He steps on the muffins, and his shoe turns into muffins, followed by his other shoe, then his sock, and finally his other sock.]
Finn: [pathetically] Mathematiclablaughh. [He falls down onto the pile of muffins, then lets out a dry cough.]
[The camera zooms in on the gas from Finn's cough, and the muffins. We see the microscopic nanites and rat germs, which merge together.]
[Camera zooms back out: the muffin pile melts down into a brown-green mixture, and then morphs into a giant.]
Muffin Giant: [shouting] Attention! I bring a message from the microscopic world! We can see you  when you go number one! [Walks away]] Beware! Beware! Beware!
Jake: Huh!
[Short ends]
