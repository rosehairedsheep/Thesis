[Finn and Jake are running towards the Cotton Candy Forest]
Finn & Jake: Woo! woo! woo!
[Enter forest] 
Jake: I think the swimming hole's right around the corner!
[Finn and Jake arrive at swimming hole.]
Finn: Yes! Woo! Woo!
Jake: First one in the water is...um...first one in the water!
[Jake runs to the swimming hole]
Finn: No fair! I have to take off my stuff.
Jake: [Laughs then falls down] Ah! Uh, eh, uh. [Finn laughs, rubs his short hair, and throws his clothes on the ground]
[Finn's hat lands near a flower and they dive in the water]
Finn & Jake: [Laugh while swimming in a circle and splashing]
[Flower goes inside Finn's hat]
Finn & Jake: [Pant while swimming in a circle]
Jake: Faster, we're getting a swirl!
[Both look at small swirl and fist-bump.]
Jake: You ready to get out?
Finn: Yeah, dude.
Jake: Let's get BMO to make us some sassages. Maybe with that one mustard? [Sassage Flare comes down Jake's leg] I'll use the Sassage Flare.
[Jake shoots the Sassage Flare towards the sky which spells "Sassage" in green letters]
Jake: Hopefully BMO sees that.
Finn: Didn't Lady tell you not to use the Sassage Flare?
Jake: Yeah.
Finn: Well, don't abuse it man. 'Cause you're gettin'...
Jake: I'm gettin' what?
Finn: 'Cause you're gettin' fat.
[Finn's hat glows and comes to life]
Finn: Wah! [throws hat] Whoa...
[Finn's hat starts chasing Finn]
Finn: [stops hat with foot] Hey. Relax.
Jake: Grob, dude! You're hat's alive! [pets Finn's hat and laughs] This is crazy! [pets Finn's hat some more] He likes me!
[Finn's hat looks at Jake's head.]
Finn: It's not my hat. It's, like, this other thing now.
Jake: Yeah, man, hats can be anything: pants, other people. It's fine!
Finn: Yeah, but it's like, living now.
Jake: Yeah, it's a miracle. Now he can listen to our rad jokes and hang out.
[pause]
Finn: Right. Maybe it's good he's alive. [kneels down to hat] You were a rad hat, and now you're a rad...little dude.
[Finn's hat looks at their heads]
Finn: Yo, bro! Our eyes are down here. C'mon little dude. Let's go live life!
[Little dude jumps, Finn carries it, and laughs]
Finn & Jake: Yeah! Woo hoo!
[Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving comes out of ground and yells]
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: [notices footprints] Aaah!!!
[Scene changes to Finn and Jake entering the Tree Fort]
Jake: [seeing the food on the table] Aw yeah! Aw yeah! BMO! Jakey likes! Look at that spread!
BMO: I did it up big time for you! Hope ya are hungry!
Jake: Ha ha! You know it!
Finn: BMO, this is Little Dude.
BMO: Hello!
[Little Dude bites Finn's arm when he sees BMO's head.]
Finn: Cribes!
[Little Dude runs to the top of BMO's head.]
BMO: Oh, what? Ahh! There's hot grease next to us; don't fool around!
[BMO tries to remove Little Dude by hitting it with a spatula and then falls off the stool]
BMO: Oh no! Get off of me!
Finn: Little Dude, no! [pulls Little Dude off of BMO] You don't jump on heads. That junk is rude, Little Dude! You okay, BMO?
BMO: I am fine, Finn. I just thought you kept better company.
Finn: Sorry, BMO, he's just excited.
[Finn carries the struggling Little Dude to the table and sits down with him]
Finn: Sorry, Little Dude, but I have to eat. [Finn puts a fruit bowl on top of Little Dude to restrain him]
BMO: Don't touch anything! I'm still frying up garnish!
Finn: Okay.
Jake: Yeah, okay. [takes some milk, pours it into a bowl, and he and Finn both dip a sassage in the milk, and then they both eat theirs]
Jake: [feeling Finn's hair] Your head looks weird with short hair man, heh, heh, it feels like a peach.
Finn: Hey, Little Dude, y'all can get in on this if you promise to be good. [mouth full] Only good babies get sassages.
Little Dude: [knocks the fruit bowl off his back] Nyang!
[Little Dude opens his mouth and walks through the sassages, which come out the other side untouched.]
Jake: Hey, don't eat the—the food?
Finn: [picks up a sassage and sniffs it] [retches] Dude, he turned it into poo! This is poo now—smell it!
Jake: [sniffs twice] Yep.
Finn & Jake: Little Dude!
Jake: [trying to grab Little Dude] Quit it! [grabs him] Gotcha!
Finn: Oh, little Deezy. What am I gonna do with you?
BMO: You guys should get ready for bed.
Finn: Yeah, okay.
[As Finn walks by, BMO spanks Finn.]
Finn: Oh!
Jake: BMO hit ya on the butt. [laughs]
[Scene cuts to the outside, where Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving is making his way toward the Tree Fort.]
[Scene cuts back to Finn and Jake, who are in their room putting on their pajamas.]
Little Dude: [reaching for Finn's head] Nyang! Nyang!
Finn: Shhhh. Little Dude, you gotta chill. [blows out candle] Night-night. [gets into bed with Little Dude]
Little Dude: Nyang. Nyang. [Finn holds him down] Nyang.
[Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving crawls past the window on the outside.]
Little Dude: [fearfully] Nyang.
Finn: Jake, wake up. Someone's on the house!
Jake: Tsk, it's probably Ice King again, dude. Man, we should tell him we know he sleeps on the top of our house. [glass shatters offscreen] Oh.
[Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving, breathing raggedly, reaches through the broken window and turns the knob to the front door, letting himself in.]
Little Dude: He-ah-ha. [licks Finn's hands]
Finn: Ugh. [Little Dude escapes his grip] No, no, no!
[Little Dude crawls up Finn's back to the top of his head and starts to squat on it.]
Finn: [gasps] No, not on my head! Poo buns! Poo buns on my head! WAAAAAH!
Little Dude: N-Nyang.
Jake: [picks up Little Dude] Gross.
[Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving starts climbing the ladder to where Finn and Jake are.]
Jake: [gasps] [stretches Little Dude back to Finn's bed]
[Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving gets onto the floor, but Finn and Jake are nowhere to be found.]
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: [breathes raggedly]
[Finn and Jake are shown on the ceiling above him. Finn lets go.]
Finn: [in midair] Ninja.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: Eh?
[Finn lands on Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving and Jake (shaped like a sumo wrestler) does the same.]
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: [in pain] Oooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Finn: What are you doing in our house, homey?
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: Please don't hurt me! You're in grave danger and it's all my fault!
Finn: Wha? What are you talking about?
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: Your hat accidentally touched my head flower. See? [touches a floorboard, bringing it to life] My magic imbues anything it touches with an evil spirit, one that craves destruction and chaos. Yech. [turns the floorboard back to normal] I buried myself so that nothing would touch my body ever again, but then this bloom grew out of my head. C'est la vie!
Finn: Evil magic donks, homey.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: I'm sorry, that's just the way my magic works. [takes out a locket with pictures of his parents in it] Papa always said I was a bad wizard. Right, Papa?! "Baby's a bad wizard." A bad wizard, huh?! You're a bad wizard! [tosses locket aside] I'm a bad wizard! [cries]
Finn: Whoa, cool it, man. Let's just fix Little Dude.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: [sniffs] Okay.
BMO: Guys! Your stanky friend jumped out the window and ran toward the Candy Kingdom!
[Scene cuts to the Candy Kingdom, where a Candy Person is walking and whistling. He comes into a dark alley and sees Little Dude.]
Cream Puff Gentleman: Oh, hello. Aren't you a cutie! Hey, are you lost, tiny gentleman?
Little Dude: Nyang! [jumps on the Candy Person's head]
Cream Puff Gentleman: [muffled screams]
[The Candy Person transforms into a muscular guy with glowing green eyes.]
Cream Puff Gentleman: Nyang, nyang! Nyang, nyang!
[Scene cuts to Finn, Jake, and Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving running into the Candy Kingdom.]
Jake: [panting] Where is he?!
Finn: [calling] Little Dude! Little Dude!
Cream Puff Gentleman: [running out of alley] Nyaaaaaaang! [comes up to a horse in front of a saloon] [The horse blows a raspberry at him] Nyang? [punches the horse, knocking it over]
Candy Sheriff: [comes out of saloon] [imitates guns cocking]
Little Dude: Nyang. [rips a streetlight out of the ground and prepares to throw it at the sheriff]
Candy Sheriff: Blisterin' beef!
[Cream Puff Gentleman throws it at him, knocking him into a building across the street. Cream Puff Gentleman then rams the building, causing it to crumble.]
Cream Puff Gentleman: [happily] Nyang-nyang-nyang-nyang-nyang-nyang!
Finn: No, Little Dude!
Cream Puff Gentleman: Nyang?
Finn: That's a bad Little Dude!
Cream Puff Gentleman: [angrily] Nyang!
[Finn and Jake duck.]
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: Aaah, horsey!
[The horse collides with his face, knocking him on his back.]
Cream Puff Gentleman: [laughing] Nyang, nyang, nyang... [continues]
[Finn and Jake run toward him and jump on him.]
Finn: Little Dude! You were supposed to be my buddy!
[Cream Puff Gentleman punches Finn, sending him sliding across the ground toward a cart of oranges. Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving emerges from under the oranges.]
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: All my fault. All my fault!
Jake: [straining as he tries to take Little Dude off of Cream Puff Gentleman]
[Cream Puff Gentleman throws Jake off of him toward Finn and Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving.]
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: Oh, gleeble snoots!
Finn: How is he so strong?
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: Whomever the hat possesses gains the proportional strength of a hat! [horse neighs] Look out! He's got the horse again!
[Cream Puff Gentleman throws the horse at the building behind them. The horse blasts its way through the other side and hits one of the Gumball Guardians]
Gumball Guardian: Evil presence detected!
Banana Guard: [imitating a siren] Wee-oo-wee—[a garbage can hits him and knocks him on his back]
[Cream Puff Gentleman continues punching Jake while stepping on Finn. Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving is cowering nearby.]
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: Sorry, fellas. I don't thrive in conflict situations!
[Cream Puff Gentleman starts stretching Jake.]
Jake: Ow.
[The Gumball Guardian arrives.]
Gumball Guardian: [points at Cream Puff Gentleman] Evil.
Cream Puff Gentleman: Nyang? [sees Gumball Guardian's head] [quietly] Nyang.
[Little Dude hops off of Cream Puff Gentleman and starts climbing the Gumball Guardian.]
Finn: No! Not the Gumball Guardian!
Gumball Guardian: Evil.
Little Dude: [stretches over the tip of the Gumball Guardian's head] Nya-hang!
[The Gumball Guardian's eyes are now glowing green.]
Gumball Guardian: Na-yang! [blows fire through its mouth]
Jake: [to Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving] Dude, use your powers!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: I can't! All I can do is think about my papa and how much I disappoint him!
[The Gumball Guardian shoots a type of laser at a different area of the Candy Kingdom, causing a huge explosion.]
Jake: Just think of something positive! Something comforting!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: Like... my mommy? When I came home with bad grades from wizard school, my mommy used to hug me, and hug me, [babbles like a baby] Ooh, Mommy! [giggles]
Jake: Uh, yeah. Just think about your mom and use your magic.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: O-Okay, let's try this. [touches a tree and closes his eyes] I... love my mommy?
[The tree comes to life and sprouts arms and legs.]
Tree: Hugs. Aw, I-I'll hug you. I'll hug you. Hug me.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: [Makes a grotesque face] Ooooh, it worked! [runs through town with his arms outspread] I love my mommy! I love my mommy!
[A bush, a lamppost, and a wheel come alive.]
Bush: Hi, friends!
Wheel: I love bein' alive!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: [touches a window and a pile of apples] Mommy!
Window: I'm a window and I'll hug you!
Apples: Ditto about hugging y'all!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: Mommy! [slaps Cream Puff Gentleman's pants]
Pants: Ha-ha! I feel like huggin' everybody!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: [touches a building] Hi, Mommy!
Building: [singsong] I'm going to hug you.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: Mommy. [touches Finn's pajamas and runs away laughing]
[The pajamas slip off of Finn.]
Pajamas: Heh, somebody... get this guy some clothes!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: Now—now rise up, love buddies, [points to the Gumball Guardian] and hug your gross brother into submission!
Love Buddies: Gonna squeeze the heck out of him! I love that guy.
Gumball Guardian: [shooting laser] Nya-a-a-ang!
[The Love Buddies climb the Gumball Guardian.]
Pajamas: [pulling Little Dude with the wheel] Come on, let's be pal-jamsas. P-Pal-jamas. Pajamas.
[The pajamas pull Little Dude off of the Gumball Guardian's head, who stops shooting lasers.]
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: Thank you, my newly conscious bros. Now return your life forces to me.
Pajamas: I loved every minute!
Wheel: Yay! Not living!
Little Dude: [angrily] Nyang, nyang.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: Ymmom!
[The Love Buddies fall to the ground, lifeless.]
Cream Puff Gentleman: Huh? [feels muscles] Yes! [runs away]
Finn: [picks up his hat] Poor Little Dude. He was just doin' it up the only way he knew how. It's not his fault he was created evil.
Jake: Yeah. He deserves to come back good.
Finn: Wizard, Mommy-magic this dude back to life.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: Okay! [touches hat] Mommy.
Hat: Oh, my goodness! What is this lovely place?
Jake: Life, man!
Hat: I see.
Finn: And this dude [points to Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving] is your pops.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: No, I-I, ooh—I guess I am. Huh.
Finn: [hands hat to Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving] Be good to this dude.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving: I will. Way better than my papa was to me.
Finn: Yup, that's the idea. Jake, looks like I need a new hat.
Jake: Okay. Let's go skin an evil bear.
[Finn and Jake walk off as Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving hugs the hat.]
