[The episode begins with Princess Bubblegum running towards her arctic base in the Ice Kingdom. At the base, Lady Rainicorn is sad and lamenting about something.]
Lady Rainicorn:  흑흑흑 안돼. 내가 왜 그랬을까? ("No, no, no. What did I do?") [Princess Bubblegum arrives at the base. Lady Rainicorn cries.]
Lady Rainicorn:  걔네들 찾았어요? ("Did you find them?")
Princess Bubblegum:  My GPS shows Finn and Jake over there [Points at the window where the Black Ice Cave is seen]. I think that's where the Ice King has them hostage.
Lady Rainicorn:  걔네들 안전할까요? ("Will they be okay?")
Princess Bubblegum:  I'm sure the boys are fine. The Ice King isn't usually a serious threat. [Digs in bag] Besides, this'll be easy with the two of us. [Holds up robotic kettle and cup] We've got science on our side.
Tea robot:  Your tea is ready. [Bubblegum pours.] Pouring. Pouring.
Lady Rainicorn:  제이크가 실종되기 전에 내가 월남국수 면이 질기다고 말했어요. 아, 내가 왜 그런 말을 했을까. 무슨 나쁜 일이 생겼으면 어떡해?! 걔가 만든 국수 맛없다고 한 게 우리의 마지막 대화였어요. ("I told him that his Vietnamese noodles were too tough before he went missing. Why did I say such a thing?! What if something bad happens to him?! The last conversation we had was that his noodles were tough!")
Princess Bubblegum:  It's okay, Lady. Jake knows you love him.
Lady Rainicorn:  미안해요. 내가 국수를 너무 많이 먹었나 봐요. ("Sorry. I guess I've eaten too many noodles.")
Princess Bubblegum:  Don't worry. Just try to relax. [Lady lowers her head calmly.] I'll work on my holo-entry. [Recording herself] It's been three weeks since Finn and Jake disappeared while battling the Ice King. I've activated a secret GPS implanted in Finn's ear. It has lead us to an uncharted black ice cave... but I've spent hours calculating every possible danger and am well-prepared.
Lady Rainicorn:  그놈이 칼을 들고 덤비면 어떡해요?! ("What if he attacks you with a knife?!")
Princess Bubblegum:  [Pulls out her Electrode Gun.] Then I'll pull out my Electrode gun.
Lady Rainicorn:  그놈이 공주님을 해치려고 하면요?! ("What if he tries to hurt you?!")
Princess Bubblegum:  [Pulls out her Ball Blam Burglerber.] Then... I'll use my Ball Blam Burglerber! Lady, it'll be fine. [Raises fist.]  We've got science!
Lady Rainicorn:  아.. 맞아요, 내가 좀 걱정이 심한 편이죠. 전 반 살은 시체들이 우리 집을 공격하는 악몽에 시달려요. 우리 삼촌, 외숙모, 사촌들이 다 집에 있었어요. 아기가 위층에서 우는 소리까지 생생히 들린다니까요. 내가 우리 가족들을 지킬 수만 있다면 — 그 꿈 꾸는 동안 얼마나 스트레스 받으면 이빨까지 무지하게 갈아요. [Grinds teeth] 다음날 일어나면 이빨들이 금 가있어요. 보통 전 그냥 그런 것 꿈이려니, 내가 걱정을 사서 하지 하며 잊어버리려고 해요. 제가 그 반 살은 시체들에게 정말 두 번이나 공격당했었잖아요. ("You're right. I worry too much sometimes. I always get haunted by this nightmare where zombies attack my house! My uncle, aunt-in-law, and cousins are all present in my house. I even hear the baby crying coming from the upstairs. If I could just protect my dear family. [Princess Bubblegum frowns.] I become too stressful during that dream. I even grind my own teeth! [Grinds teeth, then Princess Bubblegum gasps.] When I wake up in the morning, all my teeth are cracked up! I usually try to forget about it, thinking that it's just a dream or I'm being paranoid, but I was actually attacked by zombies before, twice!")
Princess Bubblegum:  Hmm. I suppose that's true. [Pours beverage out of cup] Let's roll.
[The duo enters the black ice cave. Bubblegum's GPS device reports that there is no signal.] Eh, I can't get a signal in this chamber. Let's see if they show up on my heart monitor. [She activates her heart monitor; it shows two big dots and five smaller dots. She bangs it and it shows another reading that shows two dots and a triangle.] There they are! Through this sphincter!
[They pass through the sphincter and enter a dark room.]
Lady Rainicorn:  으으, 잘 안 보이네. ("Ugh, it's hard to see.")
[Princess Bubblegum gasps after an arm brushes on her back.]
Princess Bubblegum:  Hold up, Lady.
Lady Rainicorn:  뭐예요? ("What was that?")
[Another arm brushes Bubblegum's face and she gasps. Dozens of arms come towards the girls and they struggle against them. Two arms grab and another two pound Lady's eyes.]
Lady Rainicorn:  으! 아아! 그만해! 도와줘요! ("Ah! Stop it! Help!")
Princess Bubblegum:  Don't worry, Lady! [Prepares gun] Ball Blam Burglerber-ber! [She fires a blast; the projectile explodes on the other side of the chamber. An arm pulls down Bubblegum's hood over her eyes.] My field of vision! [A tentacle takes her weapon; she gasps. Another takes her bag.] HEY!!
[Lady furiously chews on the arms that is holding her arms. Many more arm came towards them.]
Princess Bubblegum:  Lady, phase through the wall!
[She does so and the arms failed to get them. They both pant heavily.]
Lady Rainicorn:  공주님 무기들! ("Your weapons!")
Princess Bubblegum:  Come on. There's no turning back now.
Ice King [off-screen]:  [Angry] This is total bunk! You copier! You're only in love with her because I'm in love with her!
Lady Rainicorn:  [Gravely] Ice King. (아이스 킹.)
Ice King [off-screen]:  I've been playing this game a lot longer than you, pal! I've been workin' my moves, smooth-talkin' 'er, showin' 'er magic tricks! Don't ignore me! Come back!
Princess Bubblegum:  I'm picking up three heart signatures. Ice King must be talking to Finn and Jake. [The girls enter a giant air vent with a forked path.] Go to the right, Lady.
[They hear a strange noise in the left path. Princess Bubblegum gasps as a giant tongue lashes out at them. They quickly escape and enter a narrow corridor.]
Lady Rainicorn:  공주님 저 땀나게 만드시네요. ("You're making me sweat.") [They exit the passageway and find a large room with many closed eyes on all the walls.] 와, 이 방은 예쁜 새 소리에 대한 내 사랑보다 더 크네! ("Wow, this chamber is bigger than my love for pretty bird songs!")
[Eyeballs separate their eyelids.]
Princess Bubblegum and Lady Rainicorn:  Ew.
[The eyes fire lasers at the girls. Lady got shot in her face, blasting her to the ground. The eyes close their lids and an exit opens.]
Princess Bubblegum:  Lady! [Crawls towards Lady.] Lady, are you okay?
Lady Rainicorn:  으, 네. 걱정 마세요. 저 완전, 완전 괜찮아요. 자, 가요. 일어납시다! [Falls down] 으, 안 되겠네. 혼자 가세요. 전 짐만 될 뿐이에요. ("Eh, yeah. Don't worry about me. I'm perfectly, perfectly fine. Let's go. Get up! [Falls down] Guh. I don't think I will make it anyway. You should just go alone. I'll just be a burden for you.")
Princess Bubblegum:  No, Lady. I won't leave you while you're hurt. Come on. [She grunts as she lifts up Lady. She carries her into a dark room.]
[Princess Bubblegum breathes heavily as her heart monitor lights up and dims.]
Princess Bubblegum:  What are you playing at, Ice King? [Pants heavily] Three heart signatures. ...Getting closer.
[Bubblegum trips over something; she looks down; it's an eviscerated Ice King laying on the floor.]
Ice King:  Hey.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Dropping heart monitor] AH!
Ricardio:  Princess! What a pleasant surprise...
Princess Bubblegum:  Ricardio!
Ricardio:  Yes, it is I. Did you find my dungeon stimulating?
Princess Bubblegum:  [Angry] Where are Finn and Jake?!
Ricardio:  What do you see in those two? [Throwing the two in front of her.] A boy... and a dog. You deserve more mature companionship.
Princess Bubblegum:  [Gasps; to herself] Poisoned with Zanoits.
Ricardio:  You see, I thought I only wanted your heart, but I was wrong. I was unfair to you. I want the full package. [Princess Bubblegum looks appalled.] Princess...
Princess Bubblegum:  What...?
[Ricardio steps forward and reveals his new body.]
Ricardio:  I'm a man now. [Bubblegum repeatedly shrieks in utter horror.] I made myself this body for you, Princess, [The scene goes a flashback where Ricardio is still in Ice King's body.] Synthesized from Ice King's living tissue—his bones broken and reassembled.
Ice King:  [Feigning] It hurt, ooh, boy! How about a hug? Gimme a hug! I need it! [Ricardio steps on him.] Oh!
Ricardio:  Silence, Simon!  All for you, Princess! [He takes Lady away from her.] Now marvel at these powerful, articulate limbs! [He ties Lady in a knot.]
Princess Bubblegum:  [Horrified] STOP!
Ricardio:  Attached with supple and delicate sinews.
[He throws Lady against the wall.]
Princess Bubblegum:  [Gasps] AH! [In concern] LADY!
[Bubblegum tries to reach Lady, but Ricardio intercepts her.]
Ricardio:  Now, my darling, we can finally be united as man and wife.
[Princess Bubblegum squints at Ricardio's sinews. She thinks for a second.]
Princess Bubblegum:  Okay, Ricardio. I'll do it. I'll be your wife. [Proceeds to take off coat.]
Ricardio:  Ah!
Princess Bubblegum:  [Taking coat fully off] If you can beat me [throws coat aside] at hand-to-hand combat!
Ricardio:  Oh, my... How Valkyrian. Princess, you are absolu— [Princess Bubblegum punches him, while sweating and panting heavily.]
[They begin their fight. Princess Bubblegum eventually manages to detach one of his arms. When Ricardio attempts to strike her, she counter attacks and forces him to the ground. She stomps on his face.]
Princess Bubblegum:  You think we're intellectual equals?! It only took me seconds to get you off your guard! And this "body" you designed is self-congratulatory garbage! See, I know a thing or two about building a body out of biomass, [Detaching leg] and you don't... leave your heart exposed!
Ricardio:  I just wanted to impress you!
Princess Bubblegum:  You didn't. [She pounds Ricardio's face with his own leg.] Get out of my sight.
[Ricardio crawls away, whimpering pathetically. Princess Bubblegum pants heavily, then looks at the boys.]
[The scene cuts to the Candy Kingdom Hospital where Princess Bubblegum is looking over Jake, Finn, Ice King, and Lady.]
Finn:  [Waking up] Princess? PRINCESS! RICARDIO IS BACK, HE'S IN THE BLACK ICE CAVE, AND HE'S PEACOCKING HARDCORE!
Princess Bubblegum:  I know... and he poisoned you both with Zanoits, but I took care of it.
Finn:  What happened? How did we get here?
Princess Bubblegum:  I dragged you all here on Lady's back. [Jake wakes up.] It took two days. And another day to make you guys an antidote. [Goes to Ice King.]  And fifteen minutes to build the Ice King a new heart.
Ice King:  Hey, Finn. [The princess reveals Ice King's new heart.] Hee hee!
Princess Bubblegum:  I made it out of Ricardio's sinews... and some toffee and maracas.
[Ice King laughs and plays with his maraca heart.]
Ice King:  Coochie coochie coochie!
Princess Bubblegum:  I'm glad you guys are up. Please make the Ice King leave.
Ice King:  Hahaha! Shooka shooka shooka! [Laughs then claps.]
Princess Bubblegum:  ICE KING, PLEASE LEAVE!!!
Ice King:  [Happily] Ah-hay!!
[Princess Bubblegum goes to Lady.]
Princess Bubblegum:  How are you feeling, Lady?
Lady Rainicorn:  제이크 깨어났어요? ("Is Jake awake?")
Princess Bubblegum:  Yes. He's awake. [With regret] Oh, Lady. I should have never put you in danger. [Gravely] I saw on the heart monitor. I didn't know.
Lady Rainicorn:  [Hugging Princess Bubblegum] 괜찮아요. 비밀로 한 제가 잘못이죠. ("It's fine. It was my fault for hiding it.") [Flies to the three] Jake! (제이크!)
Jake:  [Happy] Lady! Oh, Lady!
Lady Rainicorn:  자기야, 나 완전 중요한 할 말 있어. [Jake frowns.] 나... ("Honey, I've got something terribly important to tell you. [Jake frowns.] I...") I am pregnant!
Jake:  ...I'M... PUPPIES!?
[The episode ends.]
