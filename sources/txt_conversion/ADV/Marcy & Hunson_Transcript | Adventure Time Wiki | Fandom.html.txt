Peppermint Butler: Swordsmith Deity, from your unseen throne, bless this sword with your mighty hone! This new sword is guaranteed to defend you against Princess Bubblegum's heinous family. Uncle Gumbald!
[CLANK]
Peppermint Butler: Aunt Lolly!
[CLANK]
Peppermint Butler: Cousin Chicle!
[CLANK]
Jake: I like your swordsmith hat.
I'm wearing it in honor of my special guest.
Jake: Am I your special guest?
Peppermint Butler: No.
Jake: Dang.
[The sword sizzles as peppermint butler dips it into a bucket of water]
Peppermint Butler: This sword will serve you much better than your old, cursed Grass Sword. This sword is also cursed, but it has a compass in the hilt!
Finn: Neat!
And now for one more thing; The special guest I now will bring!
[Peppermint Butler smashes a container of bug milk over a drawing of a phil fac]
Peppermint Butler: Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum!
[Hunson Abadeer emerges from the newly formed flames]
Finn and Jake: [gasps]
Finn: Hunson Abadeer!
Hunson: Finn the Human! And Jake the Dog! Hey, did Marceline call me-?
Peppermint Butler: It is I who summoned you. I humbly ask you for an infusion of Nightosphere magic upon this sword.
Hunson: Okay.
Peppermint Butler: I proclaim this blade [Ow! Ow!] "The Night Sword"! Now to send you back.
Hunson: Not so fast. It's like I got a free flight here. I'm gonna go see my little girl.
Finn: Back in the hole, Marceline's dad.
Hunson: I'll behave myself. No soul sucking, no evil stuff. I'm trying to be a better person. Maybe it's too late for me, but I'm trying. Oh, I'm so ashamed of the things I've done! [crying]
Peppermint Butler: Have some dignity, man! All right. You may leave the circle for one day.
Hunson: Wheeeeee! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Time to suck some souls! [sucking]
[Peppermint Butler uses the Night Sword to enchant handcuffs on Hunson.]
Hunson: Hey, what gives?
Peppermint Butler: Phantom manacles your wrists shall constrain until you're back in your hole again! Finn.
Finn: Let's go see Marcy.
Jake: Great sword making, Pep But.
Peppermint Butler: Yo, see you guys at the concert!
Hunson:  [singing] Walkin' in ooo, not suckin' out souls Walk, walk, walk, not suck, suck, suck Walk, walk, walk, not suck, suck, suck.
Finn: Hey, could you stop saying that, please?
Hunson: So what's my little monster up to these days? Is she still all goody-goody? Still half-vampire? Started dating anyone?
Finn: Yes, yes, but no, then yes again, and maybe? Look, maybe cool it with the prying around Marceline.
Hunson: Nah, she loves it when I pry.
Chicle: [chuckles] Oh, Chicle, have you finally discovered the vampire girl's weakness? I think sooo.[chuckles] Chuckling mode off.
Hunson: [whistling "SHAVE AND A HAIRCUT"] You know, now that we're here, I'm having second thoughts. It just seems like no matter what I do, I always tick that girl off.
[flashback]
Hunson: [crashes through Marceline's newly-made bunker] Marceline! Long time no see. Some googoo with glasses summoned me. What's that thing? Just gonna put this here, okay? Now let's go suck some souls!
Hunson: [present day] I don't know what it is.
Jake: [Finn and Jake drawing a PHIL face to send Hunson back to the Nightosphere] Uhh, heh.
Finn: [clears throat] Psst-psst [points to Marceline, who is staring at Hunson through the window].
Marceline: Dad, what are you doing here?
Hunson: I'm in town for the week, and I don't really have a place to stay, dot, dot, dot.
Marceline: Mnh. How many souls did he suck on his way here?
Finn: Oh, I guess like zero. But-
Hunson: See! I made Finn a cool, new sword and everything!
Marceline: I guess you can crash here.
Great! Thanks for inviting me.
Marceline: That is not what's happening.
Finn: We're gonna jet, Marcy.
Hunson: What?! You just got here. Invite them in, Marceline.
[Marceline waves them inside]
Hunson: Do you have a bathroom?
Marceline: Yeah, there's one upstairs.
Hunson: I just have to freshen up.
Marceline: Is my dad really behaving himself this time?
Finn: He's just been singing songs and stuff.
Jake: Yeah, he seems pretty fun for an old guy. Hey, wait a minute... I'm an old guy!
Hunson: Hey, excuse my unsociableness. There's just one thing; The Venetian blinds in your bathroom kind of jumped out at me and got broken.
Marceline: How could you wreck the blinds just by going to the bathroom?
Hunson: Let me make it up to you. I've got some soy sauce and some ketchup.
Marceline: I'm good.
Hunson: Here's an SD card, some twist ties.
Marceline: I don't want any of this junk!
Hunson: Hey! I'm gonna need a place to sleep tonight. Do you have an air mattress?
Marceline: Yeah.
Hunson: Great! You can sleep on the air mattress, and I'll sleep on your bed.
Marceline: It's in the closet.
Hunson: Finn, are you gonna let my little girl blow up that air mattress?
Finn: Not on my watch!
Marceline: Hey, Dad, I think I'm gonna go out for a walk before bedtime.
Finn: But, Marcy don't you have a solo gig tonight?
Marceline: Ss-ss-ss-ss!
Jake: I get it. It's air mattress talk. Ss-ss-ss-ss. Aren't you giving a concert tonight? Ss-ss-ss. At the Ghost Amphitheater? Ss-ss-ss.
Hunson: Concert? It's a good thing your friends remembered that.
MarcelineThanks, Jake.
Hunson: Let's go!
Marceline: [sighs]
Chicle: [chuckling]
Finn: Do you hear, like, a really stupid-sounding laugh?
Jake: Yes.
Chicle: I have a nice laugh.
[Finn, Jake, Marceline, and Hunson enter the Cemetery]
Chicle: Time to blend in completely unnoticed. [He phases into a ghost disguise]
Unnamed Ghost: [gasps]
Chicle: Hey, what you got there? Peanuts?
Marceline: Hello, Hamburger Hills Cemetery!
[Marceline appears in a fog on stage, and the audience cheers and applauds]
Hunson: Marceline! You're doing great, baby!
Marceline: I haven't started yet.[sings Slow Dance With You]
Hunson: Hey, Pennebaker! No illegal recording unless you're family. Yoink. [whispering] Just ignore me.
Marceline: Dad! You're wrecking the show!
Hunson: This is my daughter! I am proud of my punk daughter! I made that!
Jake: Sit down, man!
Peppermint Butler: Yeah, you're killing the vibe.
Hunson: I'm just explaining my part in all this.
Chicle: Ugh. This is terrible. Boo, I say.
Ghost: Yeah! Boooo!
[crowds starts booing]
Hunson: Don't worry, honey. I'll work the crowd. Hey, it's me Hunson! I'm happy to field any questions from you dummies.
Chicle: Can you believe Marceline has a bougie trash daddy? I heard this guy even eats ghosts, you know, like us.
Ghost: What? Really?!
Hunson: Sure, sometimes.
Ghost: Off the stage, skin sack!
Hunson: Okay, okay, settle down, pal. Don't make me come out there.
Ghost: What you gonna do "eat my fries?"
[one of the ghosts spits some ectoplasm into his hand, and throws it at Hunson, but he dodges it and it instead hits Marcline's bass]
Marceline: [gasps] My bass!
[laughter]
Hunson: Come on, ectoplasm comes right off. [goes to lick it off]
Marceline: Don't! You wreck everything.
[laughter]
[Hunson jumps out into the crowd to attack the heckling ghosts]
Ghost: Mad daddy!
Hunson: Hammer fist strike!
Chicle: Let's get him, fellas.
Hunson: Ha-ha!
[The ghosts turn red and attack Hunson]
Marceline: Dad, quit clowning.
Hunson: Uh, just havin' a little fun.[tries to turn his hand into a claw, but is restrained by the hnadcuffs]
Marceline: Come on, Dad, fight back!
Finn: He can't. Pep Buts bound his powers.
Marcline: What?!
Hunson: They sassed you.
Finn: Better pop that cork, Peps.
Peppermint Butler: All right. All right.
[Chicle throws a peanut at peppermint butler's head, which knocks him to the ground]
[Chicle morphs back into his original form]
Finn: Chicle!
Chicle: Oh, whoops, was that bad? [laughs, and becomes invisible]
[The ghosts begin to entrap Hunson. Marceline flings her bass at them, but it phases through.]
Ghost: Vampires can't hurt ghosts, stupid.
Marceline: [the ghosts fully trap the two of them in their tentacle-like arms] Shoot.
Finn: Finn's turn! [Finn uses the night sword to cut Marceline and Hunson free]
Ghost: Wha?!
Marceline: [morphs into a bat monster and flies them away] Good night, Hamburger Hills! There will be no encore.
Princess Bubblegum: My gracious. I'm so sorry you had to deal with Cousin Chicle's schemes. My family's out of control.
Hunson: It's fine. My cool daughter took care of it. And guess what I got from a vendor. [pulls out a big shirt with Marcline's face on it] It looks too big to me. But they said that's the style now with punk rockers.
Marceline: Thanks for standing up for me tonight.
Hunson: I'm bad, but I'm no so bad, right? So when are you gonna have some kids?
Marceline: Dad!
