[In Castle Lemongrab, Lemongrab is seated at a table with some of his subjects. A waiter serves up some Lemonjons.]
Lemongrab: Commence dinner.
[Everyone at the table eats a spoonful of Lemonjons simultaneously.]
Lemongrab: Dinner is concluded.
Everyone else: [in unison] Concluded. [clap twice]
Lemongrab: Up.
[His subjects carry him to his room bucket brigade-style, passing him one to the other over their heads. They drop him off at his window and leave in a hurry. Lemongrab watches his subjects harvest bunches of Lemonjons from a tree and drop them into a machine that separates them. The machine spits them out one at a time onto a conveyor belt, where they are then smashed with wooden mallets by more workers. The smashed bits are scooped into bags, then sown into a tilled field. Nearby, a Lemon Person is constructing a statue of Lemongrab out of lemon concrete.]
Lemon Person: Ooh!
Lemongrab: Mm. Lights out!
[All the workers collapse at their posts and immediately fall asleep. Lemongrab is carried into bed by his subjects. They place a baseball mitt on Lemongrab's right hand and a bag of Lemonjons on his nightstand, then turn out the light. Lemongrab gazes up at the ceiling at a mural depicting Matthew and the obstacles leading up to him. The ceiling cracks a little.]
Lemongrab: Huh?!
[A bit of the ceiling falls on Lemongrab's bed, leaving a small hole in the mural. A bug-like Lemon creature crawls out of it, and a low, distant roar sounds. Lemongrab gets stressed and grabs the bag of Lemonjons off his nightstand. He leaves his castle on his Lemon Camel.]
Lemongrab: Bye.
[The gatekeepers close the gate and collapse back to sleep. On a mountain, Finn is lying on his back with a telescope, and Jake is preparing something over a campfire.]
Finn: Better get up here, Jake. It's about to happen.
Jake: Coming! Just gotta get this cocoa pipin'.
Finn: Your loss, man. The Dap of the Heavens only happens every 20 years. [Finn looks through telescope] Oh, man. It's going down.
[Two constellations tap their "fists" together.]
Jake: Okay. Let's watch some stars.
Finn: Hmm. You missed it. It was honestly a little disappointing.
Jake: Oh. Okay. Hey, man, I think I hear something weird over there with my little doggy ears.
[Finn looks through his telescope at Flame Princess and Cinnamon Bun working out. They take a rest.]
Flame Princess: Phew! You are killing, Cinnamon Bun! This routine is locked up!
Cinnamon Bun: Oh! Thank you, Princess. You are also killing.
Finn: You mean Flame Princess?
Jake: Naw, man. What I heard didn't sound like her. Give me a peek on there. This is pretty much just a tube. [Jake looks through his flesh-scope and takes Finn's telescope] Huh. It's Lemongrab.
Finn: Uh, Lemongrab?! What's he up to at this time of night?
Jake: Uh... it looks like he's headed for the Mountain of Matthew. I hear beaucoup spookoo legends about that place.
Finn: Beaucoup spookoo, you say? We should follow him.
Jake: Huh? How come you care where Lemongrab goes?
Finn: He could, you know, he could be messing with crazy mystic power at that mountain. It's like seeing a baby playing with dynamite. Plus, seeing Flame Princess kind of messed me up. Now I gotta distract myself with work.
Jake: Okay, okay. I feel you. Let's do some things. [Jake shapeshifts into a glider and flies Finn to the mountain]
Finn: There's his Lemon Camel. Lemongrease must be inside already.
[Finn and Jake run inside caves below the Mountain of Matthew.]
Jake: Whoa!
[A Guardian of the Mountain forms and separates Jake from Finn.]
Finn: Huh? C'mon man!
Guardian of the Mountain: Nope. [Jake and Finn try to reunite from the right. The Guardian of the Mountain forms another hand to block them.]
Guardian of the Mountain: Nuh uh. [Jake attempts to stretch upwards over the Guardian of the Mountain. The guardian extends its right hand upwards to block him.]
Jake: Dang it! [Jake points at the guardian.] Quit bustin' my buns!
Guardian of the Mountain: [They look down at Jake.] You have no beeswax in the Mountain of Matthew, supple yellow dog. But you, plucky adolescent, you have way cray beeswax.
Jake: [Jake makes a noise of irritation.] You gonna be okay by yourself?
Finn: [Finn glances to the staircase leading upwards into the mountain before looking back at Jake.] Yeah, man.
Jake: Okay. [Finn and Jake fistbump. Finn runs towards the staircase and climb it while Jake turns his back to the guardian and sits down.] Just gonna sit down over hereâ€”
Guardian of the Mountain: [Jake attempts to stretch over the Guardian of the Mountain and is blocked again.] Not even.
Jake: [Jake goes back to normal and sits back down.] Dong it!
Lemongrab: Rocks. Dripping water. More rocks. Oh, I'm becoming stressed!
Matthew: Continue forward.
Lemongrab: Hmm?
Matthew: To reach me, you must choose correctly.
Lemongrab: Aah!
Princess Bubblegum: Come, Earl of Lemongrab! Let us play the game of catch. I am eager to relate to you.
Lemongrab: Yes. I desire this, as well. Huh?
Lemonhope: Thank you! Thank you all! As your younger, more relatable new ruler, I shall endeavor to undo all the order imposed by my predecessor! [All cheering]
Lemongrab: I unaccept!
Lemonhope: No, Lemongrab! You are unacceptable!
Lemongrab: Prepare to be served in a pitcher by a little child!
Lemongrab 2: What a wondrous time you've experienced, and tomorrow there will be more adventures to be had for little Lemonsweets.
Lemongrab 3: Ooh, wave farewell! What a lucky little boy you are to live so gaily.
Lemongrab: Lemonsweets.
Matthew: Choose.
Lemongrab: Ohh!
Princess Bubblegum: Lemongrab!  We understand your styles. We are of the same styles. [Laughs]
[Lemonhope playing upbeat melody]
Lemongrab 2: Eee! Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Lemongrab 3: No! It is my love that he prefers! He is spiteful of your love!
Lemongrab: Don't hurt him! Ohhh! [Breathing heavily] What? [Grunts] No! [Both shouting indistinctly] [Grunts] Ohhh! Aaaah! Ohhhh! I'm inside you! Aaaaah!
Lemongrab: [Grunts] Mnh. Sticky. [Groans] Gross! Aww! What is this? Aaaah! Why?! Ohh! Shoosh! [Grunting] Okay. [Groaning] Whoa! Ohh! Whoa! [Grunts] Whoa! Whoa! Oh, whoa! Gross! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! [Gasps] Blackness all over! Rolling in grease! You want to humiliate me?! Whoop! [Grunts]
Matthew: Taste the grease, Lemongrab.
Lemongrab: Okay. It's lemony.
Matthew: Look up, man.
Lemongrab: [Grunts] Aaaaaah! I am grease?!
Finn: Lemongrab, where you at?! Uh, cool.
Matthew: To reach me, you must choose correctly.
Finn: Who's that Matthew? Whuh-oh!
Flame Princess: Yo, get up, C.B.! This routine's got to be high-level outside the box!
Cinnamon Bun: Hey, Finn, quick! Be me, bro! Be me, bro!
Jake: Oh, yeah! It's time, BMO!
BMO: What is it? I can't smell.
Jake: Finn Cakes, boy!
BMO: Yummy! Ooh.
Finn: Yo. Dang. Finn Cakes. That's not fair.
Lemongrab: Okay. Goodbye, lemongrease.
Lemongrab: Goodbye, where?
Lemongrab: Goodbye from my grease body into the blackness, where only my pure essence can go!
Jake: Up-up, BMO. Finn always gets the first Finn Cake.
BMO: Yo, give me a break.
Lemongrab: Pure essence! Eject! [Squish!] Blorg! Bleject!
Finn: Lemongrab! Huh? Whoo!
Finn: Later, spirit bro. [Grunts] Huh? What the heck am I running on? Oh, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Cool. [Chuckles] [Laughs]
Finn: Lemongrab, you okay?!
Lemongrab: Finn, don't mess me up.
Matthew: Hi, Finn.
Finn: You're Matthew, huh? [Shing!] Your rep precedes you, bro. "Proceeds"?
Matthew: What kind of rep?
Finn: Some stuff Jake said that I interpreted as negative.
Matthew: Well, ask yourself if that feels right.
Finn: [to Finn Sword] What do you say, guy? [Finn Sword shakes his head]
Matthew: The meat bodies who've journeyed to this mountain have distilled themselves to their original source materials and  now exist in oneness.
Finn: Oneness? That's you, bro?
Matthew: I keep adding to myself until the second age of terror, when I will emerge in my final form and restore the world.
Finn: That's why you're here, L.G.? To merge with Matthew?
Lemongrab: It is one option, to know the ecstasy of my ego death.
Finn: Oh. Well, nice knowing you? I mean, I know you got issues. But you're, uh...
Lemongrab: I know.
Finn: Are you sure, though?
Lemongrab: Here's my other option. You see these? Lemonjons?
Matthew: Uh-oh.
Lemongrab: These lemonjons are me, and I wonder if they can destroy you.
Finn: Ooh, boy. Lemongrab, hold up!
Lemongrab: If you are the head that blooms atop the ziggurat, then the stairs that lead to you must be infinite!
Finn: Careful with those metaphors, bro!
Lemongrab: Infinite stairs are unacceptable!
Matthew: [Gulps, gasps] Ohh. Aaaaah!
Finn: Ooh! Whoa! Whoa! Geez!
Creature: [All groaning] Oh, no, bro! Heck, no, bro!
Creature 2: Aaaah!
Finn: Yo!
Creature 3: Smash that Lemongrab! [All shouting indistinctly]
Lemongrab: Try it, grease! [Shouting continues]
Finn: Yes! Pow! Yeah! I got you, bro!
Jake: Why are you being so opaque about not letting me in there?
Guardian of the Mountain: Well, get out a pen and paper and I'll school you on this biz. [Boom!]
Jake: Gol' ding!
Finn: Dude, I was gonna ask him to move.
Lemongrab: Oh.
Jake: Yo, class, hold on. Uh...
Lemongrab: [All moaning] I'm done! Let's go!
Jake: Okay. Here we are.
Lemongrab: Bye! Aaaaaah! [Munching]
Lemongrab: [Spits] [Splat!] Yo, yo! It's grease!
