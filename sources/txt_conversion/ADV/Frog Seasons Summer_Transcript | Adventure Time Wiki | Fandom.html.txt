[The Frog Carrying Crown is walking through the desert. The screen pans out to show an exhausted Finn and Jake following close behind.]
Jake:  Dude, how long are we gonna follow this frog?
Finn:  Patience, man. Something's totally gonna happen.
Jake:  Ahhh, so hot!
Water Nymph:  Yo, Finn and Jake! [shows the water nymphs tubing down a river to the right] If you can't take the heat, get off the kitchen! [laughs] Uh, wait. Come tube with us! [laughs].
Finn:  Sorry, water nymphs, we've gotta follow that frog. I just gotta see him put on that crown.
Jake:  What! I thought we were following him back to his treasure hoard.
Finn:  I ain't in it for the money. I'm doing it for the sake of discovery... and the ladies.
Jake:  There's no ladies!
Water Nymph: [pointing at herself] We're ladies! [laughs]
Jake:  Let's just swim with the water nymphs.
Finn:  Gotta see it.
Jake: [groans] Hey, you! Frog! Look what you're doing to the boy!
Finn: [sweating] Uuuggghh
[The frog looks back at Finn, then turns away and continues walking.]
Jake: [quietly] Put on the crown. [angrily] Put on that crown!
Finn:  Ugh, be cool Jake. [he takes off his hat, and uses it to tie his hair into a large bun] What if he puts it on and turns into, like, a beautiful wish dragon?
[The frog lifts the crown above his head. Finn and Jake gasp, but the frog doesn't put the crown on and continues holding it by his side.]
Jake:  THAT'S IT! [he stretches his arms and puts the crown on the frog's head] Ha! There, you've seen it! Now let's- eh, what?
[The frog starts emitting a rumbling sound]
Water Nymph:  Ah, you've done it now! You know the old saying; You can lead a frog to crown, but you can't... you can't... don't look him in the mouth.
[The frog expands into a monster form.]
Jake:  You take off that crown!
[Jake screams as the monster frog approaches, and lifts his gut over them, preparing to crush them.]
Water Nymph:  OHHHHH, he's about to drop a gut! [the frog crushes Finn and Jake with his gut] Dang!
[The frog picks them up and throws them into his mouth.]
Jake: [in the stomach] I think it's actually cooler in here.
