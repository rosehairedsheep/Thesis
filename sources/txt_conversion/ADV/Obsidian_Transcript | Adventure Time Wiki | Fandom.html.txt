[The episode starts out in the smoking wastelands. Elise and young Marceline are walking with their backs turned to the camera. The scene quickly transitions to the beautiful Glass Kingdom. A line of glass people are walking from the city to the top of a mountain]
[Indistinct conversations]
Sandy: [From behind the curtains on STP's stage] See-Thru Princess! [emerges from curtain] The Sun has set!
Sir Soda: [Emerges from curtain] Quit stalling!
Limeston: [Emerges from curtain] Begin the retelling!
See-Thru Princess: Uh, right.
Glassboy: [Walking up behind the crowd of glass people] Wait, wait! Hold on you guys! Sorry I'm late princess. I was-
Glass People: Reading.
[Glassboy begins walking towards the other glass children]
Glass Person #1: [In background] Book lovin' Glassboy.
Glass Person #2: [In background] Bibliophile.
Glass Person #3: [In background] Doesn't everything you read just leak outta ya?
Glass Person #2: [In background] That was a good one.
[Glassboy joins the other children. He blushes, looks up at STP, and waves. STP winks at him]
See-Thru Princess: Okay, lights!
[The lights on the stage turn on]
See-Thru Princess: Back in the old days, the wasteland desert was struck with a bolt of magic lightning.
[The lights turn off except for a single beam shining next to STP, meant to represent a lightning bolt]
Glass Person: [From under the stage] Kra-kow!
[Glass puppets are used to act out the scene that STP is describing]
See-Thru Princess: And thus was born our glorious Glass Kingdom. And, for hundreds of years, things were cool. Until from deep within the ancient furnace rose the dragon Molto Larvo!
[A dragon puppet appears behind STP]
Glass People: Woah!
See-Thru Princess: Larvo's fire gunked up our entire kingdom. It was real bad times all 'round. [Singular light beam flashes next to the dragon puppet] But the Lightning Lord above saw our trouble and sent us [A puppet of Marceline with a silver shovel appears in the light beam] a hero.
Glassboy: Ahhh! Marceline!
See-Thru Princess: [Laughs] Yes. Brave St. Marceline came our aid. With her silver shovel and a holy song, she cast Larvo back into the depths of the pit!
[Glass people cheering]
See-Thru Princess: And once a year, we gather to sing her holy song to keep the monster locked up in the furnace.
Glassboy: But... what if Marceline slayed Larvo? He hasn't been seen since that day. We don't have to be afraid of the furnace anymore!
[Indistinct conversations of disagreement]
Glassboy: I read about it in this ancient book. The furnace used to fix people! Broken people... like me.
Sandy: Don't kid yourself, crackface.
See-Thru Princess: I like the way you are.
Glass Person #1: [Somewhere in the crowd] Yeah, you have a great personality!
[Glass people laugh. Glassboy blushes]
See-Thru Princess: [Blushing] He does.
Sandy: Choirmaster! Make the children sing!
Glass children: [Singing] So mad at the coconut. I'm sick of living in the ocean. [Glassboy looks at furnace door] So mad at the coconut. [Glassboy looks at the key on STP's necklace] I don't really care about the stomping on the coconut.  [Time skips to night. Everyone is gone. The voices of the children fade] I don't really care about the stomping on the coconut.
[Alone, Glassboy walks up the stairs to the Furnace with a lantern. He pulls the lever on the wall pulls up a bar on top of the first large furnace door, which makes a loud sound. Glassboy opens the door, which also makes a loud sound. He walks into the chamber and puts STP's key in the keyhole, making the mechanisms of the second, smaller door click, and it opens. Glassboy walks through the door and sees a pit which appears to be filled with lava]
Glassboy: Aw yeah, the pit!
[Glassboy walks up to a pulley device that is set in the ground and harnesses himself. He lowers into the pit, and at the bottom, there is lava as well as Larvo's closed eye, Glassboy begins to melt slightly]
Glassboy: Huh! It's working! My life is turnin' around.
[Larvo's eye opens]
Glassboy: [Hesitantly] Oh, hi Larvo! I'm just gonna fix my crack and get... crackin'! [laughs nervously]
[Larvo roars. Glassboy gets out of the pit just before Larvo explodes out of the pit. Glassboy begins running out of the furnace chamber]
Glassboy: [Screams]
[Glassboy continues to run from the dragon. He feels his chest and realizes he left the key beside the pit]
Glassboy: The key! Crack!
[Larvo roars and keeps chasing Glassboy. Glassboy closes the second door and continues running. Larvo breaks down the door. Glassboy closes the first door and the bar slams down just as Larvo charges at it. It does not break, but makes a loud sound as Larvo slams against it]
Glassboy: [Nervously] So mad at the coconut-
[Larvo slams against the door again. All the lights in the Glass Kingdom come on and a siren sounds]
Glassboy: Crack! [Glassboy begins running down the mountain stairs] Crack crack crack crack crack crack! Crack crack crack crack crack crack - oof! [He runs into Sandy, Sir Soda, and Limeston]
Sir Soda: Gotcha, key thief!
[Limeston holds up lantern to identify the key thief]
Sir Soda, Sandy, Limeston: [Exclaiming] Glassboy?
[Larvo roars and slams door]
Limeston: What have you done!
Glassboy: I just wanted to fix myself!
Limeston: Your hideous face has angered the creature!
See-Thru Princess: Hey! I'm sure he didn't mean-
Sandy: [Dramatically] No singing in the world can stop the horrors to come now!
Glassboy: No, I can fix it! I'll find Marceline!
Sandy: Marceline lived a hecka long time ago!
Sir Soda: And you're going to the jail tower for this!
See-Thru Princess: What?
Glassboy: I know she's out there! She's probably slaying a dragon right now!
[Setting changes from Glass Kingdom to Marceline and PB's house. Marceline is in a bat form with a small hammer raised upwards. The background is red tinted]
Marceline: [Dramatically] Rahhh!
[Marceline gently hammers at a peg. It zooms out and she appears to be constructing a cabinet. She transforms back into her normal form and grabs two steaming cups from off of some instruction papers for the cabinet]
Marceline: [Blows raspberry on Princess Bubblegum's face]
Princess Bubblegum: Ugh! No! Yuck!
[Marceline and PB laugh. PB takes the black cup from Marceline]
Princess Bubblegum: Thanks, you goof.
[They sip from their cups]
[The song “It's Funny” plays during the title sequence. The setting changes to the Glass Kingdom jail tower. Glassboy is seen through a barred window. The door to his cell opens seemingly mysteriously. He only finds a Marceline doll on the other side. He picks up the doll and is next seen secretively leaving the Glass Kingdom. He begins to travel the surrounding wasteland. The setting changes to Marceline and PB's bed at night. They are both sleeping. Marceline sleep-hits PB in the face, but neither of them awaken. It zooms on Marceline's face which transitions to the face of Glassboy's doll. He walks against the winds in the wasteland. The setting changes to Marceline and PB's kitchen. PB is sitting to the right of Marceline, who is floating. PB is cutting apples while Marceline pats down a pie crust. PB tosses an apple slice at Marceline who puts it in the crust. They smile and high-five. The setting changes to a rock bridge going across some spikes where Glassboy is struggling to balance. He almost falls off. The setting changes to Marceline and PB's living room where they are sitting on the couch together reading a comic or magazine. The setting changes to the desert where Glassboy is being chased by a crocodile-like creature. The setting changes to Marceline and PB's bathroom. PB has a metal face shield on and motorized clippers in hand. Marceline is sitting calmly with a barber’s cape around her. The setting changes to the desert where Glassboy shields his eyes from the Sun. End of title sequence]
[The setting changes to Marceline and PB's living room. Marceline is playing her bass and PB is reading a book]
Princess Bubblegum: How's the song coming along?
Marceline: It's pretty whatever, I don't know.
Princess Bubblegum: [Takes off reading glasses] I rarely see you this focused.
Marceline: Thanks Peebs. Wait, was that a diss?
Princess Bubblegum: No, no! It's admirable. You're so "in the zone".
Marceline: [Blushes and chuckles] I guess I have been going for a new sound this time. I really wanna get it right.
Princess Bubblegum: Can I hear it?
Marceline: Uh... alright.
[Marceline and PB sit on the couch as Marceline play bass]
Marceline: [Embarrassed] Okay! Nope, no! It's not done yet.
Princess Bubblegum: Hey, it's alright. I can't wait to hear it when it's ready.
[PB kisses Marceline on the cheek]
[In the distance, Larvo pounds on the furnace door. Setting changes from Marceline and PB's house to the furnace door in the Glass Kingdom]
[Larvo slams on door]
Sandy: [Yelling] I can't believe it. Why would you release Glassboy?
See-Thru Princess: We need St. Marceline. Glassboy knows more about her than anyone!
Sir Soda: Glassboy is a fool!
Sandy: He'll take one step outside and get his gross crack stuck in his own foot.
[Sandy, Sir Soda, and Limeston laugh]
Sir Soda: He would!
Sandy: I know, that's why I said it!
See-Thru Princess: I just - it's my right, you know.
Limeston: Perhaps you should step down.
See-Thru Princess: No! He'll find Marceline!
[Camera pans to the door, where Larvo is staring out of a crack]
Sir Soda: Okay, but he's probably already dead.
See-Thru Princess: Hmph!
[The princess storms off and Sandy, Sir Soda, and Limeston follow her]
Sir Soda: Princess!
Limeston: Princess?
Sandy: Wait! We have more excellent advice!
[Larvo growls from behind the door. He sticks a little but of his head out and rolls some kind of glass eggs off his tongue. He goes back into the chamber. The eggs melt into the ground and bubble, forming the Glassassins]
[Glassassins shriek]
Glassassins: [Hissing] Marceline...
[The Glassassins leap into action. Setting changes to a rainy forest near the Candy Kingdom. Glassboy is walking when a shadowy figure walks behind him with a cart of moisturizer]
Glassboy: Huh? [Screams and fall to the ground] Who are you?
[The figure takes down their hood. It is Choose Goose]
Choose Goose: Good Evening! And how you been? Are you the chump with dry skin?
Glassboy: No. [Stands up and shows Choose Goose his doll] I'm looking for Marceline.
Choose Goose: Oh, quack! a boy with a head crack! [CG touches Glassboy's crack. Glassboy swats his hand away]
Glassboy: Hey!
Choose Goose: Marceline, Marceline. The Vampire Queen! Through the candy you must go to the place where grass doth grow. [Points towards the Candy Kingdom. The rain stops]
Glassboy: Thank you, strange duck. Bye! [Continues walking]
Choose Goose: How lucky for me that oblivious is he. The boy is none the wiser of my cart of illegal moisturizer!
[Setting changes to the Candy Kingdom outside of Dirt Beer Guy's Tavern]
[Candy people whisper indistinctly]
Simon: This is going out to a little girl named Marceline. [Singing] Marceline...
Glassboy: Marceline!
[Simon is singing Remember You as Glassboy walks into the tavern]
Glassboy: Hey, old guy! [Simon continues singing] You know Marceline?
Smudge: Hey! Time for you to leave.
[Simon continues singing while Glassboy gets in a scuffle with Smudge the gingerbread man. Smudge eventually ends up holding back Glassboy]
Glassboy: Old guy, please!
[Glassboy throws the Marceline doll]
Simon: [Singing] ...but it's making me crazy. [The doll hits him in the face] Oh! [The omnichord strikes an inharmonious tone]
Smudge: [Kicks Glassboy out of the tavern. He lands face-down on the pavement] Oomph!
Glassboy: Ugh!
[Glassboy gets up, sniffling]
Simon: [From behind Glassboy] So... [He puts his hand on glassboy's shoulder. In his other hand is the doll] big Marcy fan, huh?
[Setting changes from outside the tavern to Marceline and PB's house. They're on the floor in the living room playing a board game. Marceline is holding her ax bass. Simon knocks on the door and opens it. Glassboy is beside him]
Marceline: Simon!
Simon: Hi, gang. I was just playing out at Dirt Beer Guy's tavern... [Simons voice fades as the music swells and the view focuses on Marceline, who has a shiny aura around her] ...then this guy showed up. [Motions to Glassboy]
Glassboy: [While running towards Marceline] Ahhh! St. Marceline! [He bows down to her]
Simon: [Awkwardly] I'm... just gonna use your um... facilities.
Princess Bubblegum: Sooo... you know about Marcy then?
Glassboy: Do I! Half vampire, half demon, half god!
Marceline: Nice.
Glassboy: She single-handedly bested the horrible dragon Larvo!
Marceline: Larvo?
Glassboy: The dragon has returned! The Glass Kingdom needs you again dude.
[Marceline's face transitions to a younger version of herself as she briefly reminisces about how she defeated Larvo. The flashback is set on the mountain with the furnace. Younger Marceline strikes a loud chord which draws Larvo into the furnace chamber. A previous See-Thru Princess closes the door and locks it, trapping Larvo inside]
Previous STP: She did it! Marceline, you won!
[Younger Marceline turns to younger PB, breathing heavily]
Younger Princess Bubblegum: [Quietly] Seriously?
[Glass people surround younger Marceline, cheering, as she turns her head away from younger PB]
Younger Princess Bubblegum: Fine. We're done.
[She turns away from the crowd and runs away with tears in her eyes. Young Marceline looks back at her with a sad expression. Her face transitions back into current Marceline, ending the flashback]
Marceline: Uh... I don't know...
[Marceline blushes and turns her head to PB, who puts her hand on Marceline's shoulder]
Princess Bubblegum: Yeah, we're sorry about your kingdom, kid. But we know other heroes who could help-
Glassboy: [Still on his knees] Pleeeeease!
[View cuts to the outside of the house. The Glassassins are perched on a ledge looking down on it. They hiss as they descend upon the house. They break down the door, revealing Simon in a blue muumuu and small crown holding the Marceline doll and turned towards Marceline and PB's open freezer]
Simon: Ahhh, ahhh! What! This is how I cope!
[The Glassassins get dangerously close to Simon]
Simon: Please don't! I'm too old to die!
[Glassassin stabs Marceline doll]
Simon: [Gasps] You're after Marceline? Too bad, goopy! She already left!
[Glassassin hisses and the doll catches fire. The view transitions to PB and Marceline riding a motorcycle in full biker gear. PB is holding onto Marceline's waist as she drives. Glassboy is tied to the back with bubble wrap on his head. They are revealed to be in the wasteland desert. The scene fades out and cuts to a new setting. It's a broken-down trailer in the wastelands 1000 years ago]
Elise: [From within the trailer] Now, next to the family of bugs draw... a silver tree.
[View cuts to young Marceline drawing with a crayon on the floor]
Elise: Perfect.
Young Marceline: Now What?
Elise: Hm... [Elise is now seen on a couch wrapped in a blanket. There are papers scattered on the floor] above that tree... draw... a panda with a hat.
Young Marceline: That's silly. I want to draw a walrus in an overcoat.
Elise: [Shakes head] No, no. The panda is very important.
Young Marceline: Okay, mommy.
[Marceline begins to draw the panda]
Elise: Give him a hat. A biiig pointy hat.
[Marceline continues drawing. View transitions to the outside of the trailer]
Elise: You're gonna be a great artist when you grow up, Marceline.
Young Marceline: [Fading along with the transition of the trailer then to it now, buried in more sand and more broken down] Yeah, I know.
[Present-day Marceline and PB ride by the trailer]
Marceline: Hey, why are we going this way?
Princess Bubblegum: Because it's the fastest route. Why do you ask?
Marceline: Nothing. It's just... I used to live around here...
Princess Bubblegum: What, really? When was this?
Marceline: I don't really wanna talk about it.
Princess Bubblegum: [Playfully] Ooooo, so mysterious all the time. Just like your song. [Clicks teeth, pauses] How ya doin' back there Glassboy?
[Glass boy writhes and says something, but it's muffled]
Princess Bubblegum: This is all gonna go great.
[PB smiles and looks up to the sky behind her, where a large bird seems to be following. Fades to their arrival to the Glass Kingdom, which is glistening. Marceline stops the motorcycle and PB jumps off]
Princess Bubblegum: Wow! It's just as beautiful as I remember it!
[PB walks up to a large glass bell]
Princess Bubblegum: The great ceremonial glass doorbell!
[PB rips off her motorcycle gear revealing her to be in a yellow sweater, peach yoga pants, and dark pink slippers]
Princess Bubblegum: I love ceremony. [Softly] First, approach the bell quietly and give it a single strike.
[PB picks up a mallet and hits the bell]
Princess Bubblegum: And now for the best part [A small compartment opens on the bell’s foundation revealing a bowl filled with sand] - the welcome bowl!
[PB dips her face in the bowl and eats some of the sand and it gets all over her face]
Princess Bubblegum: Mmm, sand!
[PB chokes on the sand and drops the bowl. Marceline grabs Glassboy from the back of the motorcycle and rips off the bubble wrap, dropping him to the ground]
Glassboy: [Coughs] I was thinking if we have some time left over after you defeat the dragon then maybe- [Marceline cuts him off by putting her helmet over his head. He continues to talk, though muffled]
Marceline: [Apathetically] Hey, Peebs. Can we get this over with?
[PB continues to cough while a shard rises from the foundation of the bell]
Shard: No visitors! We're in a state of emergency.
Princess Bubblegum: [Eagerly] Yes, and we're here to help-
Shard: Do you have a royal invitation?
Princess Bubblegum: Well, not officially, but-
Shard: No invite, no entry. Get lost Pinky!
Marceline: Okay, that's it.
Princess Bubblegum: [Chuckles] Actually, someone probably remembers me.
[Marceline grunts and kicks the bell down in one swift motion, and it collapses into the kingdom wall with one final toll]
Shard: Grrr! The great bell! Vandals! [Marceline, PB, and Glassboy are all on the motorcycle, which charges towards the bell] When the other shards get here, they're gonna [Slow-motion] chiiip [The front wheel of the motorcycle breaks the Shard's helmet, which causes his voice to get much higher] yooouuu uuup!
[The shard glances down and notices his helmet is broken. Marceline, PB, and Glassboy are all riding up the fallen bell. They land smoothly in an open glass area. Glass people gasp and murmur]
Marceline: [Takes off her helmet] Where's the dragon?
Princess Bubblegum: [Puts her arm around Marceline and whispers] Be cool. I'll handle this with diplomacy.
[Marceline concedes. She leans against her ax bass with an apathetic expression]
Princess Bubblegum: Apologies for the unorthodox entrance, glass citizens.
Sir Soda: Surround them now!
[A group of shards surrounds them and point their spears at them]
Princess Bubblegum: Uh-oh
[The shards part for Sandy, Sir Soda, and Limeston]
Sandy: Filthy opaque intruders!
See-Thru Princess: [From behind the circle of shards] Glassboy!
[The shards part for her. She quickly glides over to Marceline, PB, and Glassboy]
Sandy: [Disappointed] Wait, I was being haughty!
[PB bows and Marceline raises her ax bass as STP glides towards them]
Princess Bubblegum: It's wonderful to formally meet you [STP glides past PB and Marceline. Marceline lowers her ax] Your... Majesty.
[STP continues to glide towards Glassboy, who is a short distance away from PB and Marceline]
Glassboy: STP!
[STP hugs Glassboy]
See-Thru Princess: I'm so happy to see you alive.
Sandy: Well we're not. Glassboy snuck a pair of trash-water harpies into our perceft civ- into our perfect civilization. Shards! Take him back to the tower, you guys.
[A group of shards walk over to Glassboy]
Glassboy: It's Marceline! The real Marceline!
[The shards take his hands and begin dragging him to the tower]
Sandy: [Pointing at Marceline who is standing nonchalantly, picking her nose] Bah! This could be any run-of-the-mill cave hag. Why should we believe you even?
[View changes to show the Glassassins looking down from the surrounding wall]
Glassassins: [Hissing] Marceline...
[One of the Glassassins charges at one of the shards, alerting Marceline. Quickly following, another Glassassin takes down the rest of the shards, surrounding Marceline. Glass people scream]
Marceline: What?
[The Glassassins all charge at Marceline. She blocks them with her ax bass]
Princess Bubblegum: [Gasps] Marcy!
[PB strikes a pose and begins shooting jelly beans from her palms. The beans melt into the back of one of the Glassassins. She realizes it's not working and shoots one last weak jelly bean, which makes a small fart sound. The glass people shake their head in disapproval]
Princess Bubblegum: [embarrassed] Heh heh. They're jellybeans. It's not gross.
[The Glassassins all simultaneously try to stab Marceline but she jumps away with a grunt]
Marceline: Alright whoever you are. [Raises ax] Let's play.
[The Glassassins very quickly spring into action. Marceline kicks away the first one, slices the second one vertically, and the third one horizontally. The third one is seen reassembling, and it laughs evilly]
Marceline: Dang.
[The Glassassin quickly charges past her]
Marceline: Hey! [Charges after it] Get back here! [The Glassassin jumps and she floats after it and stops] Grrr! Why ya hidin', bro?
[Marceline looks around. The other two Glassassins are behind her. The first one charges at her and tackles her into a building, which clangs. The Glassassin tightly wraps her arm around Marceline]
Marceline: [Screams]
Princess Bubblegum: Oh no!
Glassboy: St. Marceline!
[Glassboy reaches but STP holds him back. Marceline is pinned by the Glassassins. One of them thrusts towards her as she raises her bass in defense. The Glassassin hits it and it makes a loud chord, stunning the Glassassins]
Glassassins: [Shrieking]
Princess Bubblegum: Sound waves? [Yelling] Hey Marceline! Turn up the reverb!
[Marceline plays an even louder chord, which makes the Glassassins turn into small globs of black glass]
Glassassins: [Shrieking]
[View cuts to Larvo within the furnace room]
Larvo: [Roars]
[View cuts back to PB]
Princess Bubblegum: [Wipes hand on forehead] Phew.
[Marceline descends, breathing heavily]
Glass People: [Chanting] Marceline! Marceline!
Marceline: Bleh-heh-heh-heh! [Holds up shaka sign and sticks out her tongue]
Glassboy: Oh yeah!
See-Thru Princess: [Quickly] Oh my gosh, she is so dope.
Glass People: [Chanting] Marceline! Marceline
[PB frowns]
Marceline: [Turning to Sandy] By the way, I consider "cave hag" a compliment.
[Marceline strikes a pose, and five glass people slide behind her]
Glass people: Ooooo!
Sandy: Hmph!
Marceline: Next up, [Puts ax bass over shoulder] taking care of that dragon.
[The glass people cheer in the background as PB makes a sadder expression. The Glassassin goo makes a hissing noise and slides off-screen. The Glass people continue to cheer as Marceline and PB lead them up the mountain]
Glassboy: Oh yeeeah! [Glassboy is seen jumping on the motorcycle as four glass people carry it up the mountain] Redemption for Glassboy!
Glass Person: [Reverently looking at Marceline] Cleansing spray?
[They spray and wipe Marceline's face, making it shiny. She coughs]
Marceline: Bleh!
Princess Bubblegum: Ah, you got sprayed. That's a pretty high honor.
Marceline: Woah, wait. [The shine leaves her face] Did you wanna be sprayed too?
Princess Bubblegum: [Exaggerated] No, no! I'm happy everyone's treating you so well! I'm just... [Sighs sadly] it's like I'm nothing to them.
[PB looks away sadly. Marceline puts her arm around PB]
Marceline: [Softly] Hey. You're everything to me, okay?
[They smile at each other]
Larvo: [Roars and slams on the door]
Glass Children: [Singing] So mad at the coconut. [Larvo continues slamming on the door] I'm sick of living in the ocean.
See-Thru Princess: [With children singing in the background] [Worried] How long will it take you to write a new incantation?
Marceline: Incantation?
See-Thru Princess: The dragon's grown too powerful to be repelled by your original holy song!
Glass Children: [Singing] So mad at the coconut. [One child faints] I'm sick of living in the ocean.
Marceline: Dudes, your ceremony isn't working because you've been donking up the lyrics. [Yelling] Listen up, y'all!
[Marceline readies her bass, but hesitates]
Marceline: [Softly] Um, Peebs? Are you gonna be okay hearing this again?
Princess Bubblegum: [Smiles sadly] Do what you have to do Marceline.
[Larvo slams on the door and Marceline begins to play "Woke Up". The Glass people look excited. PB looks upset. At the beginning of the chorus, a flashback begins to when Marceline first sang the song. Larvo is trapped in a bubble being generated by two machines. Younger Marceline makes an effort to anger younger PB. At the beginning of the next chorus, younger Marceline kicks down one of the machines, breaking the bubble. Larvo spits fire which burns through Marceline's hair. Unphased, she turns around and sings to Larvo, making him back away. Ancient STP closes the door and locks in Larvo near the end of the song. Younger Marceline turns around and closes her eyes, which transitions into current Marceline giving nearly the exact same expression. For a moment everything is silent. The glass people murmur. Marceline floats back down to talk to PB]
Princess Bubblegum: [Sadly] I guess you've still got it.
Marceline: [Compassionately] Listen Bonnie... you know all that stuff I said-
Glassboy: [Loudly] Oh, I get it now. That song's about her, [Points at PB] isn't it?
[Glass people laugh]
Sandy: Of course, it's not even subtleee.
Marceline: [Growls]
[PB blushes, embarrassed. Larvo slams on the door and breaks a hole with his hand. He hits one of the glass people, which melts them. His claws drag on the ground with a screeching sound]
Glass people: [Screaming and running]
Marceline: [Frustrated] Why didn’t it work?
Princess Bubblegum: It’s been like a million years since that song worked. Mind if I try?
Marceline: What?
Princess Bubblegum: Screeeee!
[The Morrow appears with two identical machines]
The Morrow: [Screeches]
[The Morrow drops the machines in front of the door. They form a bubble - more colorful than the bubble from the flashback]
Larvo: [Growls]
[Larvo reaches his arm out the hole and scratches at the bubble with no effect. PB snaps on some goggles]
Marceline: The Morrow was following us with that the whole time? Peebs, were you… expecting me to fail?
Princess Bubblegum: [Typing on a keyboard] We never did figure out why your song worked in the first place. My next-gen barrier will buy me time to figure out Larvo’s true weakness.
Sir Soda: [Talking to STP] Your outsider’s song just made the dragon angrier and sassier.
Limeston: What’s your plan now?
See-Thru Princess: [Panicky] Alright, um…
Glassboy: Marceline can do it. Tell them, Princess! Princess! Tell them!
See-Thru Princess: [Pushes away Glassboy] Put a cork in it, Glassboy! Please! Just get out of my face for five seconds!
[See-Thru princess walks away with Sandy, Sir Soda, and Limeston. Glassboy frowns. Larvo scratches as the bubble and breaks it, though it quickly reseals itself]
Princess Bubblegum: Ah! I got this, I got this, I got this.
Marceline: No. It has to be me. I’ll write a new, angrier song! [Plays opening chords to “Woke Up”] [Singing angrily] The other day, you used my brush. It was okay. I… didn’t… mind. [Stops playing and descends] Ughhh. I’m just not that angry young punk anymore! It’s like I don’t even remember what it’s like to be hurt, and sad.
Princess Bubblegum: Mhm.
Marceline: No. It’s still in me somewhere. I just have to go find it. [Begins to walk away]
Princess Bubblegum: [Stops typing and pulls up goggles] “Go”?
Marceline: [Gets on motorcycle] I have to go back. Back to the place where I was hurt the most. [Puts on motorcycle helmet]
Princess Bubblegum: Marcy, this is a bad idea!
[Marceline revs up the motorcycle, kicking up dust, and leaves. PB coughs. She makes an angry expression, hears Larvo, and gets back to work. Marceline is seen leaving the kingdom] [Setting changes to 1000 years ago in the wasteland desert. Young Marceline holds a map that she drew]
Young Marceline: [Lowers map to reveal a broken-down water tower] That’s it! That’s the hat panda! Look, mom!
[Elise walks up behind young Marceline in a cape and with a walking stick]
Elise: You’re a regular cartographer, Marcy. [Stops next to young Marceline] We’ll be at the secret clubhouse party in no time.
[Young Marceline’s stomach gurgles]
Young Marceline: Mom, will they have food there?
Elise: Every party has food. [Grabs Marceline’s hand and begins walking] All the good parties anyway
[Young Marceline’s stomach gurgles]
Elise: Hey, let’s play a game. I see… something that starts with an “S."
Young Marceline: Huh. [View cuts to a small scorpion with a backwards cap and 3D glasses] [Slowly] Is it that scorpion?
Elise: [Surprised] No.
Marceline: [Slowly] Is it that skeleton under the scorpion?
[View zooms out to reveal the scorpion being atop a large human-like skeleton wearing a chain]
Marceline: Maybe we should play something el- [Aggressively coughs]
Marceline: [Excited] Ooh! [Points] I see something that starts with a “P”! [Runs ahead of Elise and approaches a dog-like creature] Puppy! [Pets it and giggles. The creature is docile] This puppy’s funny-looking.
[The “puppy” turns around revealing an odd set of eyes]
Puppy: Whazzup?
[Elise, startled, whacks the puppy with her stick]
Puppy: W’zup!
[Another dog growls and shrieks. View pans up and it’s a much larger mutated dog, presumably the puppy’s mother]
Elise: Woah mama.
[The mother jumps down from the ledge and tackles Elise. Elise holds up her stick in defense as the mother tries to bite her. It bites through the stick with a loud snap and chews it up. It roars from a mouth in it’s chest. Young Marceline jumps on top of it]
Young Marceline: Bad doggy!
[The dog throws off young Marceline]
Elise: Marceline!
[Young Marceline gets up and growls as dust swirls around her. Her eyes are large and red. She sucks the mother dog’s soul. She looks pained and holds her stomach when she’s done]
Young Marceline: [Looks up at Elise] Mommy? [Elise appears frightened] Why are you looking at me like that?
Puppy: [Walking up to his mother] Whazzap? [He circles her, lays down, and whimpers]
[View pans to the water tower, it transitions to the water tower as it currently is. Roughly in the same shape, but plants have climbed it. Current Marceline is on shown on the motorcycle with her helmet up. She puts in back down and leaves]
[Setting changes to the Glass Kingdom. PB and STP are near the bubble]
Larvo: [Growling and trying to break the bubble]
See-Thru Princess: [Gasps]
[PB takes a small striped orb out of her pocket and presses a button on it, causing it to expand. She holds it up and a glass tube comes out of a hole in the top]
Princess Bubblegum: Huah! [She thrusts it into the bubble, stabbing Larvo’s hand. A red-orange liquid fills the tube and drains into the orb]
See-Thru Princess: You’re so competent!
Princess Bubblegum: Yeah, I’m a pretty good stabber.
[PB walks over to a setup with speakers surrounding a glass citizen shaped like a petri dish on a table]
Princess Bubblegum: [To the glass citizen] Thanks for volunteering.
[PB pours a drop into him from her device]
Glass Citizen: The giant baster seems excessive.
[PB slides headphones onto his head and walks over to her control panel holding a larger pair of headphones]
Princess Bubblegum: Check, check.
[Loud cacophonous sounds play from the speakers. Sandy, Sir Soda and Limeston cover their ears]
Sandy: [Loudly] Is this what passes for music in Cotton Candy Land or whatever?
[The liquid morphs into an angry black glob, similar to the Glassassins]
Glass Citizen: What’s this now?
[The glob hisses and jump toward PB]
See-Thru Princess: [Pointing] Look out!
[PB quickly pushes away STP and shoots root beer at the glob. It crystalizes and PB catches it]
Sandy: [To STP] Gah! You’ve gone warped, Princess. First Glassboy, then that fakey Marceline. Now you’re putting faith in a princess even more helpless than you, okay.
[PB frowns]
Sir Soda: So either grow up or step aside!
[Larvo slams at the bubble. Transitions to Larvo hitting against the first bubble. Younger Marceline is playing bass in the background]
Younger Princess Bubblegum: [Pressing buttons on device] [Hurriedly] Oh geez, oh geez, oh geez, ahhh geez. [Yelling] Don’t worry, good people! I’ve got this under control! [At a normal volume] Just need a sec.
Younger Marceline: Yo, Peebs. Listen to this. [Plays opening chords to “Woke Up”. Notices PB isn’t listening. Flies up closer to her and continues to play. Nudges her in the face with bass]
Younger Princess Bubblegum: [Grunts and swats at Marceline] [Angrily] Why are you acting like this?
Younger Marceline: Oh, come on. You love it.
Younger Princess Bubblegum: They’ll all be killed if I don’t figure out how to defeat the dragon!
Younger Marceline: They’re made of glass. They break. Who cares?
Younger Princess Bubblegum: I do. They need me.
Younger Marceline: [Unamused] Uh-huh
[Younger Marceline floats over to a group of three ancient glass people and begins hitting them on their heads]
Ancient Glass Person #1: [In the pitch of A] Ah!
Ancient Glass Person #2: [In the pitch of C#] Ah!
Ancient Glass Person #3: [In the pitch of E] Ah, that hurts!
[Younger Marceline smiles and looks at younger PB]
Younger Princess Bubblegum: [Unamused] Stop it. [Turns to device] I don’t have time for you right now.
Younger Marceline: Ugh! Why are you being such a bummer?
Younger Princess Bubblegum: [Turns to Marceline] Could you just get out of my face for five seconds, you jerk!
Younger Marceline: [Yelling] If you didn’t want me here, then why did you ask me?
Younger Princess Bubblegum: [Yelling] I didn’t! They called for me and you tagged along. [Turns and walks away] [At a normal volume] Go home. [Begins working] I honestly can’t focus with you here acting like monster trash.
Marceline: [Scoffs] [Quietly] Well… as long as we’re being [tears up] really honest… [Begins playing Woke Up]
[View cuts to young Marceline strumming a box guitar/ukulele sitting on a wooden bench in a dirty building]
Young Marceline: [Sighs]
[View cuts to a broken-down, dirty gas station]
Elise: [While running a key in a motorcycle] Come on. Come on, come on!
Young Marceline: Mom? Am I… a scary monster?
Elise: Marcy, come here.
[Elise kneels down and hugs young Marceline]
Elise: [Begins violently coughing]
Young Marceline: Mommy!
Elise: [Finishes coughing, pulls hand away from face, and gasps. There’s blood on her hand] Hey, sweetie. I’m gonna fix this motorcycle up for us, but it’s gonna take awhile. [Takes a keycard off from around her neck] Here’s a special VIP card to get into the secret clubhouse. [Puts the card around young Marceline’s neck]
Young Marceline: What?
Elise: [Coughs] You’re… you’re gonna be late for the party. [Turns back to motorcycle] Follow the map.
Young Marceline: But I wanna stay with you!
Elise: Marceline! I don’t have time for you right now!
[Young Marceline runs out of the gas station. She is next seen looking down at her map with her box guitar slung around her back]
Young Marceline: [Looks up] Secret clubhouse! [She walks up to the door, which is already ajar. She puts the keycard up to the pad] Boop! [She walks into the dark room] Hello? [Giggles] [Sing-song] I see you. Party! [She flicks on a light switch. There are a bunch of skeletons. She turns the light off. There is a blinking red light on the right wall]
[The light makes a bright flash transitioning the setting to the current Glass Kingdom. PB holds the crystalized glob in her hand]
Princess Bubblegum: I’ve figured out a way to stop Larvo for good. It’ll be risky.
See-Thru Princess: Risky? I’m on thin ice as it is.
[A group of glass citizens stand by Sandy, Sir Soda, and Limeston, at a distance from PB and STP. Sir Soda is looking at STP and PB with large binoculars]
Sir Soda: I wish I could read lips.
Princess Bubblegum: You’re a princess.
See-Thru Princess: Yeah.
Princess Bubblegum: Which means protecting your people no matter what. Even when your vampire girlfriend bails on you.
See-Thru Princess: Oo.
Princess Bubblegum: We need a system to convey a butt-ton of liquid, but I don’t have the resources here.
See-Thru Princess: [Excited] My people can help!
[STP pulls out a gleaming silver spoon and taps it on her head as she turns to her citizens, making a light dinging sound]
Glass People: [Chanting] Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
See-Thru Princess: I have a plan to defeat Larvo.
Princess Bubblegum: Based on my research!      
See-Thru Princess: And it’s going to require all of us.
Sir Soda: [Walking to the front of the crowd with Sandy and Limeston] What’s with the touchy-feely inspirational jazz?
See-Thru Princess: Can it! I’m over you thimble heads always chipping my cups! [Addressing crowd] This is a crisis, and I intend to lead with transparency.
Princess Bubblegum: [Pumps fist] Role-model! Right here!
[PB’s smile transitions to a face drawn on a cardboard box. Young Marceline is drawing the left eye with a red marker]
Young Marceline: Hm.
[She turns and picks up her box guitar. She looks up at the blinking red light and sings “Red Light” to a circle of boxes and cans with faces drawn on. The view shows some of the inside of the bunker]
Young Marceline: Whadaya think, Lemmy? [As Lemmy] That was great! [As a can character] Yeah. You’re so good at music, Marceline! [As a sad box character] Why is your mom scared of you? Where is she? [As herself] She saw what I did to the mean dog. Then she found a scooter, and… [As sad box character] And that was her ticket outta town. [As mean box character] You scare everybody away, Marceline. Just like your dad. [Sniffles] [As a different can character] Hey, Marcy did that on purpose! Like a funny joke. [As herself] [Chuckles] Yeah, that’s right. When people get scared and run away, it’s because I want them to! [Stands up and strums a major chord]
[View fades and transitions to the outside of the bunker as it currently is. Some plants grow over it. Current Marceline rides her motorcycle up to it, stops, and gets off. Glassboy peaks through her satchel Current Marceline stops briefly at the doorway and sets down her bass]
Marceline: [Looking down] What’s up, Lemmy? [As Lemmy] Hey dude.
[The old box guitar rests against Lemmy. The red light is still blinking]
Marceline: [Floats up to the red light] This thing always got on my nerves. [Taps the light, then presses a play button]
Machine: One new message.
Elise: [From the recording in the machine] Marceline… you’re there aren’t you? [Elise is shown sitting next to the scooter in the gas station talking into a phone] Brave girl. I’m sorry I had to trick you. [Coughs] But you’re tough enough to handle this world on your own. [From machine] And it’s not gonna change you because… you have a good heart [Marceline looks away] [From the gas station] I love you, Marceline. I hope you can forgive me. [Drops phone]
Machine: End of messages. [The light turns off]
[Marceline descends into a kneel with her chin resting on the rung of a ladder]
Marceline: [Crying] [Sniffles and wipes face] Ugh. Mom…
[The door creaks open and footsteps approach]
Marceline: [Gasps] Mom?
Glassboy: [Dramatically stepping into the room] It’s me, Glassboy! [Laughs and does a small jump towards Marceline] Haha! I heard something weird so I came in.
Marceline: I wanna be [Stands up and takes a slightly demonic form] [Yelling] alone right now! [Breaths heavily]
Glassboy: Please don’t send me away. I-I’m just like you!
Marceline: [Collapses face-down on the floor] [Annoyed] You don’t say.
Glassboy: I thought I was sad that See-Thru Princess turned on me, [Sheds tear] but now I know it was just [Crosses arms and shakes shoulders] punk-rock anger. [Slides over and grabs the box guitar. Begins to dramatically sing “See Through”]
Marceline: [Laughs softly] Is that really what I sound like? Oh, what am I doing?
Glassboy: Huh? We’re here to reconnect with your [Shakes fist] punk-rock anger!
Marceline: Nah, I need to be with Bubblegum. [Stands up] She’s good for me. It’s not her fault I’ve got baggage.
Glassboy: Oh. Well… [Walking out with Marceline] When we get back, maybe I can show you all my fav manga.
Reformed Glassassin: [Growls] Can’t… run… [Bear its spikes]
[Marceline pulls out her ax bass. The Glassassin quickly stabs a hose right through it and smashes it on the ground]
Marceline: [Eyes turn red] [Quietly] My bass. [Shouting and taking on a demonic bat form] My bass!
[Setting changes to the top of the mountain in the Glass Kingdom where Larvo is clawing at the bubble. View descends to a street where PB and STP are standing]
Princess Bubblegum: Ready?
See-Thru Princess: Hm!
[PB presses a button on her device, disabling the shield. Larvo emerges from the chamber]
See-Thru Princess: Here it comes.
[Larvo exits the chamber and his maw comes crashing out]
See-Thru Princess: [Loudly whispering] He got really big.
Princess Bubblegum: [Yelling] Down here Larvo!
[Larvo growls as he quickly climbs down the mountain. Glass people with root beer in their heads stand on top of the buildings lining the street. Larvo smashes into some buildings on his way down]
See-Thru Princess: Now!
[The glass people pour the root beer onto Larvo. He roars as the root beer cools around him, steaming and crystalizing]
Glass People: [Cheering]
Princess Bubblegum: I did it! [Touches hands with STP] All that root beer came from my body!
[The glass people continue to cheer as Larvo growls inside of the crystal. It begins to break. Larvo breaks out of the crystal roaring. Some of the root beer crystals stuck to him, forming a sort of armor. The crystals rain on the glass people]
Glass People: [Screaming]
Larvo: [Roars]
[A horrified look falls on PB’s face]
[Setting changes to the desert outside of the bunker]
Glassassin: [Roars]
Marceline: [Floats up to them in a bat form] [Yelling] Any other day, I would totally annihilate you for wrecking my stuff.
[Glassassin stabs at Marceline but she dodges]
Marceline: [Picks up Glassboy] But Bonnie is more important.
[Glassassin stabs at her. She quickly flies away]
Glassboy: Haha! Eat it!
[Glassassin shrieks and looks back at them]
[Setting changes to the Glass Kingdom street. The ground rumbles]
Glass Lady: Ahhh! The molten one!
Larvo: [Growls]
[The glass people run away screaming as Larvo roars and destroys buildings]
Glass Person: Caution! Broken glass!
[Glass people continue screaming as Larvo burns stuff down]
Sandy: It’s just as we predicted.
Limeston: It’s going to destroy us all!
Sir Soda: C’mon! [Raises knife] Now’s our chance to act!
[Sandy, Sir Soda, and Limeston all run past the dragon screaming]
Sir Soda: Run, run, run!
Sandy: Okay, you got a head start.
[Marceline and Glassboy are shown quickly flying towards the smoking Glass Kingdom]
Marceline: Oh no, I’m too late!
Princess Bubblegum: Run to the bridge! [Pointing in the direction of the exit]  Egress! Egress!
Marceline: Bonnie!
Princess Bubblegum: [Happily] Marceline!
[Marceline puts down Glassboy]
See-Thru Princess: Glassboy!
Glassboy: Princess.
Princess Bubblegum: Quick, get out your bass and start singing.
Marceline: My bass is smashed.
Princess Bubblegum: Ah! You loved that bass! Well, ummm… then your new song must be extra angry and sad.
Marceline: [Thoughtfully] No, it feels more like… [Turns to face the wind] a wave of acceptance has washed over me
Princess Bubblegum: [Gets on her knees] Nooooo!
Glassboy: Hey, I wrote a hateful song! [Grabs box guitar and starts playing] [Singing] See-Thru, I see right through-
Marceline: Look out!
[Larvo approaches, growling mostly at Glassboy. He swats at PB and Marceline, who land on some glass steps. Glassboy runs away from the fire-breathing Larvo, pushing STP]
Glassboy: This thing really hates me! [He continues running from Larvo and looks up to the furnace] [Gasps] ‘Scuse me. [Pushes STP out of the way]
See-Thru Princess: Woo!
Glassboy: It’s me you want! [Points at Larvo] Leave my princess alone!
Larvo: [Growls and continues chasing him]
Glassboy: [Screams]
[Sandy, Sir Soda, and Limeston are all hiding behind one of the shield generating machines at the top of the mountain]
Sandy: This is the last place the beast will- [Larvo and Glassboy approach the furnace door] Huh?
Glassboy: [Running from a stream of fire in the chamber] I didn’t think this through!
See-Thru Princess: [From outside] Glassboy!
[Marceline, holding PB, flies into the chamber]
Sandy: Yeah! Get in that death hole! [Whispering to Limeston and Sir Soda] So what now?
Limeston: The forcefield! We’ll crank it all the way up!
Sandy: Yes! [Typing on keypad] We can trap them both in there forever!
[Forcefield charges, rumbles, and crackles]
PB: [Inside the chamber] Ah! Someone turned my forcefield on full blast!
[Marceline and PB run deeper into the chamber where Larvo and Glassboy are as the forcefield charges some more. PB grabs Glassboy]
Sandy: [From outside] Uh, I think someone broke this.
Sir Soda: Bail?
[The forcefield seemingly explodes, but it remains intact at full capacity. Marceline and PB are thrown forward from the blast]
Marceline: [On the ground] PB?
Larvo: [Grumbles, trapped under a pile of rubble]
Marceline: [Gets up and sees PB with her hand on Glassboy’s head, which is face-down] [Gasps] Is he breathing?
Princess Bubblegum: No. But that’s okay. I don’t think he breathes. [Glances at the caved exit] We’ve gotta find a way out of here.
[Marceline turns into a large armadillo-type creature and digs at the wall. More rubble comes crashing down]
Princess Bubblegum: Ah! Stop! The forcefield has destabilized the entire chamber.
[Rubbles stops falling and Marceline goes back to normal]
Princess Bubblegum: Why did I even create a “full blast” setting. [Shrugs] Live and learn.
Marceline: Hm. [Sits down] This is pretty bad, huh?
Princess Bubblegum: Yeah, pretty bad. [Sits close to Marceline]
Marceline: Probably should’ve tried singing anyway. [Looks down]
Princess Bubblegum: [Sighs] I was sorta hoping your song wouldn’t work. So I could finally show the Glass Kingdom how much of a scientific genius I am.
Marceline: [Playfully] Well, mission accomplished?
Princess Bubblegum: [Chuckles]
Marceline: I’m so sorry I left you alone on this. It’s just… being back here, where all this bad stuff happened… [Sighs] My mom and I didn’t talk about bad stuff. When she got really sick, she didn’t even tell me. She meant well, but… I think it messed me up about being honest about my feelings. You and me are in a good place now. [Jokingly] Well, not right now, obviously…
[A rock falls]
Princess Bubblegum: [Chuckles]
Marceline: You know, if this really is the end… I have something I want to sing to you. [She walks over and unclips the box guitar from Glassboy’s back. She turns him over and pats his chest. She walks back over to PB tuning the box guitar. She clears her throat, strums one more chord, and sings “Monster”. During the song, Marceline makes a brief flashback to her and PB as “kids”, laughing. During the chorus, Larvo flashes back to how he got bit on his head when he was young, giving him a scar like Glassboy that he hid under a shell as he grew up. As Marceline is finishing, her and PB lean in closer to each other. When Marceline is done, PB pushes the guitar down]
Marceline: Oh!
[PB kisses Marceline for a somewhat prolonged amount of time before pulling away]
Princess Bubblegum: [Holding onto Marceline] Marceli- [Larvo roars and rocks crumble] [Yelling] Oh, glob!
[Marceline and PB stand up as Larvo frees himself from the rock. They hold onto each other]
Princess Bubblegum: [Loudly] I love you, okay?
Marceline: [Sweetly] At least they’ll find our skeletons entwined forever.
Princess Bubblegum: I don’t have a skeleton, but that’s pretty romantic.
[Larvo roars, writhes, collapses, and takes the shell off of his head, which emits a bright light. He seems to die, but a sparkly, singing cat-butterfly comes out of his corpse]
Marceline: Stay back!
Inner Larvo: La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la!
Marceline: Look, it’s got a mushy center! [Quietly] Just like me.
Princess Bubblegum: Yeah! We can totally kill it now!
Marceline: [Grabs PB’s wrist] Peebs, no.
[Glassboy gets up and sees Marceline and PB]
Glassboy: Woooah. Also, ew, but mostly awww.
[View changes to the outside]
Sandy: [To STP] Shutting down the barrier? Um, it’s not advisable, [kneels] Majestyyy
See-Thru Princess: Shut your blowholes! [Takes Sir Soda’s knife] You trapped my best friend in there to die. Shame!
Sir Soda: [Sadly] Yo, my knife
[STP swings the knife into the machine, it pushes the four back, shrinks, and explodes, releasing Inner Larvo]
Inner Larvo: La, la, la, la, laaa! La, la, la, la, laaa!
[Glass people exclaim. The Glassassin is on the roof of a building. It looks up and sees Inner Larvo]
Glassassin: Huh?
Inner Larvo: La, la, la, la, la, laaa!
Glassassin: Awww! [It crumbles, revealing six small cat-butterflies]
[Glass people murmur as they come up the mountain. Marceline and PB come out, shortly followed by Glassboy]
Glass Man: [Off screen] This is going to cost million to reglaze.    
See-Thru Princess: [Off screen] Glassboy.
Glassboy: [Gasps]
[STP is shattered nearly in half]
Glassboy: My Princess! You’re- you’re…
Glass Man: Highness, are you alright?
[STP does a princess wave with her unattached arm]
Sandy: [Walking over with Sir Soda and Limeston] [Apathetically] What a tragic turn. I am so sad to tell you that your reign is over.
Sir Soda: On account of that nasty crack.
See-Thru Princess: No Way.
[She grabs her separated half, pulls herself up, and wraps a gold sash across her chest and waist and pulls it tight]
Glass Man: [Gasps] She got pants now.
See-Thru Princess: We were taught that cracks make us less, but one brave boy showed me the truth. [Puts her hand on Glassboy’s head] That’s you, Glassboy.
Glassboy: [Proudly] Me!
See-Thru Princess: [Kneels] You don’t need to hide that crack…ever.
[One by one the glass people start revealing their cracks and murmur]
See-Thru Princess: All of you? Why were you hiding them?
Purple Glass Man: I was afraid people would judge me… the way I judge them.
Blue Glass Person: [Takes off head] Me too.
Sandy:  No, no, no! Everyone, stop taking your clothes off!
Sir Soda: Hey Sandy, what’s this? [Pulls back one of Sandy’s ribbons, which was hiding a crack]
Sandy: It’s nothing! [Covers herself with her hands]
Limston: [Pulling off one of Sir Soda’s ribbons] You have one too!
Sir Soda: Frosty jerk!
[Sandy, Sir Soda, and Limeston get into a fight cloud, and all end up unraveling each other’s ribbons, revealing that they have the most cracks of everyone. They run away, crying]
See-Thru Princess: [To Glassboy] Sorry I ever doubted you.
Glass Man: Yeah, sorry for bullying you your whole life.
[Hoofbeats approach. Simon is on a Jelly Horse carrying a trailer alongside another Jelly Horse]
Simon: Marceline, you’re in grave danger! But don’t worry! I brought help!
Banana Guard: Hooah!
[Two more Banana Guards spill out from the trailer door]
Banana Guards: Wee-woo, wee-woo, wee-woo, wee-woo! [They trip over each other]
[Bronwyn runs out of the trailer. Finn steps out with a full beard, a towel on his head, a towel on his waist, some scars, and a flowery tattoo of Jake on his chest – he’s definitely older]
Finn: Hey, PB. Y’all got monster troubs?
See-Thru Princess: PB, are these friends of yours?
Banana Guard: Have at you! [Throws spear, hits Marceline]
Marceline: Ah! Come on. [Pulls spear out of her arm]
Princess Bubblegum: Yep. These are my people. [Another spear flies by. PB and Marceline duck] And I’m really proud of them.
See-Thru Princess: That man’s towel just blew off. [Points to Finns towel, which landed in front of her]
Finn: My bad
[Marceline looks away awkwardly]
Princess Bubblegum: [Shrugs] Eh.
[Glassboy sings “Eternity With You” with STP while glass people, PB and Marceline, Finn, two Banana Guards, Simon, and Bronwyn dance at some open venue. At the chorus, Glassboy sings a sour note which makes the punch bowl explode, as well as Sandy, Sir Soda, and Limeston’s heads. The music pauses]
See-Thru Princess: Shards?
[Some shards come to sweep them up. The music continues]
Princess Bubblegum: [While dancing with Marceline] I must look a real mess.
Marceline: Nuh-uh. You always look great after fighting a monster.
Princess Bubblegum: You think so? [Blushes and lets her hair down, giggling] This is nice. We never get to dance. You’re always the one performing.
Marceline: I have a lot more songs I wanna sing. Reeeal sappy ones.
Princess Bubblegum: Good. I’ve always loved your songs
[PB’s face transitions to a way younger version of herself. She’s at a concert. A younger Marceline (nearly identical to the Marceline in the breakup flashbacks, but with different clothing) comes on stage. She starts sweating so she takes off her shirt and tosses it to Bubblegum. Younger Marceline winks and Younger PB blushes]
[Screen cuts to black]
