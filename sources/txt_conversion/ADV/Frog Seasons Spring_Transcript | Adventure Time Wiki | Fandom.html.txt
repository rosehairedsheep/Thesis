[Petals blow through the air, and then fall to the ground. The Frog Carrying Crown walks past the petals, and the screen pans out to show Finn and Jake following him.]
Finn:  What do you think is gonna happen when he puts it on?
Jake:  I don't know but I bet it will be un-frog-gettable.[1]
Finn:  Maybe he'll turn into a prince.
Jake:  [they walk into a field] Nah, man, you gotta kiss him for that to happen.
Finn:  [Breezy is flying around behind them] I am NOT kissing that frog.
Breezy:  [holding pollen] Hey guys!
Jake:  Breezy!
Finn:  Hey bee, what's up?
Breezy:  Not much, I'm just showing the boys how to collect pollen.
[Bees are seen flying around flowers, and trying to collect the pollen.]
Breezy:  [talking to bees] You're doing great guys! [talking to Finn and Jake] Hey, you want to know what I'm gonna do with this later?
Finn:  [laughing]
Jake:  Yeah, we'd love to chat Breezy but see we're following this frog just now so, you know. [shows the frog walking towards a cornfield]
Finn:  Oh yeah, right!
[The frog walks into the cornfield.]
Finn:  [walking away from Breezy] We just really want to see him put on that crown.
Breezy:  Yeah, I hear 'ya!
[Finn and Jake walk into the cornfield.]
Breezy:  Have fun!
Finn:  [walking out of the cornfield] Where'd he go?
Jake:  [pointing] Probably to that sweet water lily pad castle.
Finn:  [shows the castle] Nice!
[The frog walks out of the water and into the castle.]
Finn:  [Walking through the water] Jake, there's little tadpoles in the water.
Jake:  Don't let 'em get up your pants.
Finn:  [approaching the castle] These shorts are tighter than tadpoles.
[Finn and Jake go to the door, which is slightly ajar.]
Finn:  He left the door open! [Finn fully opens the door]
[Finn and Jake crawl through the hallway, then look through the window.]
Jake:  [gasps]
Finn:  [shows the frog in his dressing room] There he is.
[The frog puts on a royal red cape.]
Finn:  [looking through the window] He's gonna put it on!
[The frog picks up his shoes, exhales on them, and rubs them to make them look shiny.]
Jake:  [shows the frog putting on the shoes] You're cute enough now!
Finn:  [angrily] Put on the crown!
[The frog puts on white silk golves.]
Jake:  [groans, and prepares to walk away] I can't take it anymore!
Finn:  No wait! He's doing it! [shows the frog picking up the crown and lifting it above his head] Come one frog! Do it! Do it! Dooo iiittt!
[Frog Guards look at Finn and Jake angrily. They scream as the guards open the door.]
Jake:  [frog guard holding Jake's hands behind his back] Ah, come on! We was just curious! Easy with my piano hands, chief.
Finn:  [frog guards drag him away as the frog is putting on the crown] Wait, uh, no no no no no no no, NOOOOOO!
[The frog puts on the crown, and there is a bright flash of light.]
