[Finn and Jake are walking through a forest at night.]
Finn: And when that salsa cloud had you by the tail...?
Jake: Ha ha, yeah. And I swung him around into that golden cactus?
Finn: [Laughs] Man, that was algebraic.
Jake: Yeah, man, that adventure was tight.
Finn: Yeah.
Jake: I can't wait to get back home, though.
Finn: Yeah, me, too!
Jake: I need some sleep—
Finn: I'm gonna play some Battle Wars with Neptr on BMO for an hour, then work on that flier for PB's laser recital and catch up on my correspondence with my pen pal Danny Gladiolas from over in Maryville.
Jake: [Nods] Great minds. [Points to head]
Finn: And then next what I'm gonna do is I'm— whoop! [Disappears down a hole]
Jake: Finn? [Runs towards the hole] Finn! [Hits head on branch] Ohh! [Groans, stumbles backwards, and falls into another hole] Oh...
[Finn wakes up to the sound of marching. He opens his eyes to see a line of Food Boys carrying empty trays.]
Finn: What the...?
[Finn walks to the edge of the huge chair he's standing on and looks out at the room. Several food boys are seen carrying food, preparing food, and tending to a cuckoo clock.]
Finn: Man, where's this supposed to be?
[Chomping and munching can be heard. Finn turns to look for the source of the sound. A Huge King is being fed by the tiny food boys.]
Finn: Uh, excuse me? Sir?
Huge King: Hmm? Oh! You're awake! Oh, that's wonderful!
Finn: Oh, thanks. Hey, where am I, anyway?
Huge King: Why, this is the famed Kingdom of Huge, of course. Heh. You fell through that crack in my ceiling and landed in a normal-sized pie.
Finn: Mm-hmm. Well, my friend up top is probs pretty worried about me, so I'd best get going. Can you give me a boost back up to that crack or whatever?
Huge King: Oh-ho-ho! No, no, no. Don't be silly, child. Your friend must be on his way to find you right now. You should wait for him here, or you could miss each other.
Finn: Hmm. I guess that does make sense.
Huge King: Of course! Besides, you're just in time to witness the chiming of my wondrous clock! It's set to do its chiming in merely an hour's time!
[The clock bears the inscription "IN TOIL WE KRIMBER."]
Finn: [To himself,] "Krimber"?
Huge King: Come! Food boys! Shower our guest with the kindnesses of Huge! We will await the clock's chiming in style and comfort.
[Finn sits and a food boy presents him with a cake. He grabs a bit and starts to eat it.]
Huge King: Dig in, child! There's always more to come!
[The food boy moves on, and another presents Finn with a plate of apple scruffs.]
Finn: Mmm. Oh! Apple scruffs!
Huge King: Just wait 'till you see my clock!
[Jake wakes up to see a bear with a candle on his head and bells strung around him whistling and playing cards (Freecell) with himself on a platform suspended by what appear to be parachutes. Close-up on a glass jar of water with a metal ladle in it, followed by the bear's card game with a green book titled "Dividing The Day" next to it.]
Bear: Ahh, good, you're awake. [Gets up and walks toward Jake] Good good good good good. How you feelin'?
Jake: Ohh... [Rubs head] My--my cabbage aches a little... What happened?
Bear: [Sits down] Well, here I was, playing some Freecell, and then, wow! You fell down the hole, bounced off parachute #2, and landed on three ol' walnuts.
Jake: Parachute? Hole? Walnuts? Fell down, wait! [Gets up] You mean we're falling right now? [Stretches up and to the left] Thanks for your help, buddy, but I gotta go.
Bear: [Grabs onto Jake as his feet leave the platform] Woah, hold up! [Jake's reached the wall with Bear holding on] What's your hurry?
Jake: My friend's still up top. He could be looking for me. Or, he could be in trouble and every second I'm down here I'm falling further away. I gotta get back.
Bear: Uhhh, I think that's a pretty bad idea. You were unconscious while you were falling, remember? So you mighta been falling for weeks, or even months. [Platform falls further away] Trust me, it's possible. This is a very deep hole. If you try to climb out, you could run out of food.
Jake: But, I've got to do something.
Bear: I feel like you should probably not starve to death, so that when your friend comes looking, you're still alive.
Jake: Mmm. You know I think you're right! [Stretches down to the platform] Finn is a pretty heroic kid, I gotta admit. He'll probably be here in half a gif.
Bear: Oh, good, good. Well 'till then, please, make yourself at home. Here, [takes a walnut from under his hat,] have a walnut.
Jake: [Takes the walnut] Thanks, man. I'm Jake, by the way.
Seven: Hi, Jake. I'm Seven-seven-one-eight. Strange name, I know, but I'm pretty sure. See, I carved it in the floor when I first got down here so I wouldn't forget.
[He points out the inscription. It reads "7718" from Seven's perspective, but looks like "BILL" from Jake's.]
But you can call me Seven for short.
[Back in the Huge Kingdom the clock begins to chime when a bronze hunter shoots an arrow into a bronze turkey.]
Huge King: Oh! [Claps and laughs] Oh! So marvelous!
[The food boys have stopped moving to watch. The clock spins so that the turkey and hunter disappear through one door, and out of the other comes a pair of figures who each hammer an anvil in turn.]
Huge King: [Pulls at his face] Oh! [Throws his arms out and laughs] Ooh-hoo-hoo! Ah-ha-ha!
[The clock turns again, and in place of the anvil comes a woman holding her hands over her ears while two infants cry and bounce on either side of her.]
Huge King: Oh. Oh my, oh my. [Laughing]
Finn: [Stands up.] Well, that was actually pretty cool, but I should probably get going.
Huge King: Wh-a-a-a-at?! But, how can you leave now? [Waves a hand at the clock] The clock is set to chime again in merely an hour's time!
Finn: I feel like Jake should've been here by now. I mean, what if he's lost, or--or hurt?
Huge King: But... this is not the Huge Kingdom Way.
Finn: [Uses the food boys' ladder to get down from the chair] Sorry man. I've got my mind made up.
Huge King: [Gasps]
Finn: Thanks for the food, though!
Huge King: Food boys! [Points] Seize the child!
[The food boys obey, grabbing Finn off of the ladder while he yells in protest. They drag him back onto the chair. Finn's face turns bright red.]
Huge King: I'm sorry son, but this is for your own good. If you just stay put, all you need will come to you in time, like it has unto me. But, you must sit, you must wait. [The food boys tie Finn up with a huge spaghetti noodle] Yes, yes tie him up with normal spaghetti and bring him food, yes! [Laughs]
[A food boy runs up to Finn and flings a turkey at him from his serving tray. The line continues to move.]
Huge King: Soon you will see, my boy! All good things come to those who wait.
[The clock continues to tick on the far side of the room.]
[Whistling can be heard as a horse-drawn wagon comes into view, moving down a trail in the forest. The wagon is being driven by Seven, who wears nothing.]
Seven [voiceover]: It started out as a day like any other. I was a door-to-door sales bear specializing in candles and playing cards, making my way to the Candy Kingdom like I'd done 200 times before.
[The horse shivers, alarmed by something unseen. It shakes its head and starts into a full run.]
Seven [voiceover]: I guess my horse got stung by a bee or something, 'cause all of a sudden he just skronked the math out. We went off-road and I got thrown back into my wagon.
[The cart bounces, and Seven is thrown into the wagon as he said. A moment later he peeks out of the stopped wagon. The entire vehicle is stuck in the middle of a hole in the ground. The horse looks in, blushing. The wagon sinks at a steady rate.]
Seven [voiceover]: When the shaking stopped I crawled out, only to find I was wedged deep in a hole and sinking fast. I had just enough time to rig up a parachute...
[He pulls the cover off of the wagon frame and ties the ends just before the wagon falls freely into the hole. The horse in the opening shrink above him.]
Seven [voiceover]: ...And I've been falling ever since. Sometimes walnuts would fall into the hole, and sometimes rain.
[A walnut falls onto Seven's head. Later he turns his head up into the rain, eyes closed.]
Seven: And I guess that was enough.
Jake: [Eating walnuts on his stomach] Mm. So how did you pass the time?
Seven: Well, for a long time I just waited to be rescued.
Seven [flashback]: [Hugging his knees] 599 Mississippi... 3,600 Mississippi... [Opens his eyes wide as though startled]
Seven [voiceover]: But that was crazy boring.
Seven: [In the present,] So then I got really into Freecell and things got a lot better.
Jake: Freecell?
Seven: Yeah, it's like Solitaire but there's very few unsolvable shuffles.
Jake: Mm.
Seven: It's a great game, great game. I really love it. [A beat] But it's nice, you know, to have someone I can play Freecell alongside of.
Jake: Yeah, man. You know, also, I know some other card games we could play. You know, together.
Seven: [Gasps, blushes, stifles a giggle with one hand] I forgot there were games like that!
[Both laugh, Seven falling backwards and kicking his legs in the air.]
Huge King: And then, there was another time--This was several years back--The clock chimed early, and I thought, "oh boy, here we go." But it turned out, one of the food boys had simply gotten wedged under... Finn!
[Finn, his tongue sticking out while he thought hard until now, turns to Huge King.]]
Finn: Huh?
Huge King: Are you listening?!
Finn: Of course. Food boy in the clock.
Huge King: Huh. Yes. [Turns back to the clock] Anyway, as I was saying, one of the food boys had gotten himself wedged in the...
Finn: [Thinking,] All right buddy, let's run through this again. 'Cause we're only gonna get one sht.
[The air ripples as we move to Finn's imagined future. The clock strikes midnight and begins to chime.]
Finn [voiceover]: When the clock strikes 12, I beckon kindly to yonder food boys.
Finn: Hey, you guys like clean jokes?
[The pair of food boys come closer to listen. One is carrying cake on a tray, which Finn bites and spits into each of the food boys' mouths.]
Finn [voiceover]: Then chuck some delicious food in their mouths. Having never before known generosity, they'll immediately make me their leader and undo my spaghetti.
[The food boys untie Finn and stand back. He frees his arms victoriously.]
Finn: Ha ha!
Finn [voiceover]: Then, with a perfectly timed serving tray, I'll deflect the hunter bot's brass arrow.
[Finn throws a tray like a frizbee at the clock. It flies between the hunter and turkey at the right moment so that the arrow is deflected.]
Finn [voiceover]: Swift but delicate, the arrow will gain heft via the chandelier bat's filched asparagus.
[A bat carrying an asparagus stalk much bigger than itself drops the vegetable when the brass arrow pierces it. The arrow continues to fly with the asparagus held by its shaft. Back in the present, Finn looks focused on his thoughts.]
Finn: [Thinking,] Meanwhile, the serving tray from before has entered phase two, sending Ken Mangosteen careening into the clean silverware.
[In Finn's imagination the serving tray sweeps under Ken's feet and continues, sending him into a pile of silverware. A spoon lands in front of Finn's chair, and he does a flip and lands upright on the end of its stem.]
Finn [voiceover]: But also, the asparagus arrow has caused a domino thing of food to happen, culminating in a huge lemon falling.
[The asparagus and arrow hit a box of dehydrated mashed potatoes, knocking it back and causing the mentioned domino effect. The lemon at the end of the shelf falls to land on the head of the spoon, catapulting Finn into the air and through the hole in the ceiling. He spins gracefull in the air, surrounded by a sparkling bubble effect.]
Finn [voiceover]: It's not a perfect plan, but with a little luck, I think it's got a good chance.
[The clock chimes in the present now, and Finn smiles.]
Finn: Hey, you guys like clean jokes?
[The food boys come over as planned. Finn spits cake into their mouths and they untie him.]
Finn: Ha ha!
Huge King: What the--Food boys, sieze the child!
[Finn runs and jumps over his chair's armrest onto the ground with a grunt. He hurries to a ladder as the food boys on the floor chase him.]
Huge King: Finn?! Finn! There's nowhere to run, Finn. You know you'll never escape. [Laughs]
Finn: [Reaches the top of the ladder and stops.] I'm not trying to escape anymore! [Runs down the shelf] I'm gonna murder your stupid clock, you psycho!
[The chandelier bat flies into Finn with the asparagus stalk. He pushes them away.]
Huge King: [Gasps] No!
Finn: Yup!
[Huge King growls and struggles to get out of his chair. It takes a supreme effort, but he finally breaks free with a grunt and, panting, races across the room to stop Finn.
Finn is on the shelf still, fighting four food boys. He throws one off of the shelf before he notices Huge King's approach. Huge King tries to grab Finn, but Finn jumps from the shelf onto another ladder before he can.
Huge King then puts a foot down on one of the food boys and slips. He shouts as he falls onto his back with an impact that shakes the whole room. Finn sees this, then starts to climb the ladder.
He gasps as three food boys climb down the same ladder in his direction. The closest one hisses. Finn jumps and lands back on the ladder hard, breaking it in half. The food boys fall and Finn lands on his hands and knees on the shelf.
Huge King gets up behind Finn, growling. Finn gets to his feet and runs across the remainder of the bookshelf with Huge King in pursuit, breathing hard. Huge King stops to catch his breath, one hand on his knee and the other on his chest.
Finn jumps from the shelf onto the vent hood over the stove. The clock hangs from the front of the hood. Huge King can only watch, panting and coughing, as Finn makes his way across the hood and slides back behind the clock.
Wedged in the small space between the clock and the hood, Finn grunts until he can kick his legs out, causing the clock to fall. His hands scrape as he catches the hood to keep from falling himself.]
Huge King: Nooooo!
[The clock hits a pot on the stove as it falls in slow motion, knocking it over and sending water spilling out over the stovetop. Huge King watches in horror as the clock hits the floor, breaking apart in an explosion of gears and springs. The water puts out the fires on all of the stove.
Above the vent hood the chimney rises a way, then turns into an unwalled tunnel. Far above Jake, now wearing a card skirt and crown like Seven's, beat-boxes while Seven raps.]
Seven: ♪Crazy interest, Accumulate, Figures, Bigger interest
♪Capital time, Forgotten like, Stars and naysayers, Cards and barbs
[The parachutes begin to fall, slowly at first.]
Seven: ♪Warm scarves, To the hot house, Take your... socks off...
[The platform falls quickly now. Jake and Seven scream as they fall with the platform down through the vent hood, landing on the water-covered surface of the stove. Jake groans and sits up, rubbing his head. Finn is gripped in Huge King's giant hand.]
Finn: [Gasps] Jake!
Jake: [Looks up] Oh! Hey, Finn! Who's your new friend?
Finn: He's not my friend, he's bad! He kidnapped the heck out of me!
Jake: [Gasps] Why you...
Huge King: [Smugly,] What are you gonna do about it? Maybe I'll go ahead and kidnap you t--!
[He's cut off as Jake stretches his fist, making it gigantic and punching Huge King in the face. Finn laughs as he falls through the air, still in Huge King's hand.]
Finn: Whoo!
[In the daylight above ground, Finn and Seven ride on Jake's back out of the forest. Seven is no longer wearing his cards, but still wears a bell as a necklace. He turns his face to the sun and sighs happily.]
Finn: Hey, Seven. Now that you're out of that hole, what's the first thing you want to do?
Seven: Hmm... Oh! I want a giant flipping hot dog. Mmm!
Finn: Yeugh. [Turns to face forward] Don't you know those things are made out of, like, the grossest junk?
Seven: Man, I don't give a toot!
