[The screen starts white, then shows Finn and Jake in snowsuits walking through the heavy snow. Finn looks up, and they see a big fortress made of ice, with green clouds swirling above. Finn and Jake then crawl up the ice, revealing people are frozen inside each block.]
Finn: Wow, everything sucks here!
Jake: Finn, look!
Finn: Oh jeez, this looks pretty real. [shows The Enchiridion floating above a pit of green liquid and ice] He's got the Enchiridion! [shows Bobby trapped in ice, but part of his sword, as well as most of his head, are sticking out unfrozen] And, wait, is that Billy? Why is he so tiny?
Jake: [Pointing upwards] Hey, there's our guy!
Farmworld/Ice Finn: [Enters with his mother, father, and baby brother trapped in ice] WOOHOO! HAHAHAHAHAHA! [moves his family away from him with ice magic] Yeah, just hang out there for a while! I love it! I feel fresh, hahahahahaha!
Finn: [takes off hood and snow goggles] Well, this is the weirdest thing I've ever done. [Pulls a case out from his backpack]
[A blue screen appears, with white letters that say "One Hour Ago".]
[Jake is hanging from the ceiling from his feet, holding Finn's feet. Finn is holding BMO's feet, and BMO is blindfolded and holding a knife. They are spinning in a circular motion.]
Finn, Jake, and BMO: Round and round and round we go!
[BMO hits a poster with his knife. The poster says "Headmaster: The Final Lesson", and it shows an angry man in a suit.]
BMO: Hiya!
Finn and Jake: [in the same formation] Oh yeah!
BMO: [partially takes off blindfold] School's out 'ya trench!
[Prismo's pickle jar on the table starts to glow.]
Jake: Woah! [Finn, Jake, and BMO fall from the ceiling.] Oof!
Finn: Hey, Prismo's calling!
Jake: Nice! Let's go say hi.
BMO: You're lucky I don't take you out, kid! [struggling to pull the knife from the wall] Quit crying baby!
Finn and Jake: [touching the pickle jar] PRRRIIIIIIISSSSSMM- [A burst of light takes them to Prismo.]
BMO: [falls from the wall] Oof!
Finn and Jake: [sent to the Time Room] OOOOOO!
Finn: TION!
Prismo: Thanks for responding to my call, guys! I'm in a serious pickle, and I mean the brown kind. I mean like a really smelly, brown pickle.
Jake: Don't sweat it, boy! Finn and I got yo' back!
Finn: [makes a fist with his hand] Who's bullying you Prismo?!
Prismo: Nobody's bullying me. Look, um, remember when you wished the lich never existed and you created a new wish reality that ended up totally not working out?
Finn: No.
Jake: Vaguely, yes.
Finn: What?
Jake: You don't remember making that wish!
Finn: Wu-huh?
Jake: I thought I explained it to you that one time.
Prismo: Dude, I'll catch you up. [a remote appears] Look! [A recap video shows clips from the episodes "Finn the Human" and "Jake the Dog"] After you wished the lich never existed, you accidentally created an alternate wish reality where magic doesn't really exist.
Finn: Wait! [The video showing Farmworld Finn pauses]. Who's that dude?
Prismo: That's you! But sort of less cool.
Finn: Uh-huh, proceed.
[The recap video shows Farmworld Marceline]
Prismo: So you find an old Marceline and the crown on the body of Ice King's skeleton who was smushed under the weight of a frozen mitogenic bomb. But then the destiny gang steals your family donkey, so you use the crown to become Ice Finn and save your donkey and your family. But, the crown makes you crazy, and you ice everything up like a dumb bozo, which sets off the mitogenic bomb, which releases the spirit of the lich anyway. But then, this reality's Jake made a counter wish which supposedly fixed the problem, but as it turned out, it didn't really.
Finn: Can I just say that I don't remember any of this stuff.
Prismo: Because technically it didn't happen to you. But, also it still happened, and that wish reality continues to exist.
Finn: Is this why all of a sudden one day I was better at the flute.
Jake: Oh yeah, I noticed that!
Prismo: Listen! Something, really bad, is about to go down. [A hologram of the Enchiridion appears above Prismo's finger] Ice Finn is using his world's Enchiridion to build a portal to the multiverse. I literally do not know what will happen if he succeeds, but it could def's be catastrophic to the architecture of these realities. Now if that happens, my boss, let me repeat that, my BOSS will hold ME responsible, and by proxy, y'all both be in the dip too.
Finn: Why don't you just bloop bloop it all better?
Prismo: Something there is dampening my powers. I AM LOSING MY PICS OVER THIS BIZ!
Jake: [whispering to Finn] His boss! Who's that?
Finn: Alright, man, what do we do? [a wooden case appears in Finn's hands]
Prismo: Take this, and use it to take care of the Ice Finn.
Finn: Oh, wait what do you mean by take care o-
Prismo: Good luck guys we're all depending on you! [Finn and Jake are sent to the place where the episode started at]
Finn: [now back to where the episode was before the "One hour ago" screen appeared. Finn opens the wooden case] Woah.
Jake: What is it?
Finn: [Finn pulls out The Maid from the wooden case] Oh golly!
Jake: [takes off snow goggles] What's that thing now?
Finn: It's like 50 bowling balls on my teen bod! Oh, check it! There's instructions. [Reads instructions] The maid will handle all Class A interdimensional Bung-ups if you follow these simple steps: direct the small end of the Maid towards your massive mistake [shows Farmworld/Ice Finn]. Focus your intention until all distractions leave your thought sphere [shows Bobby struggling to get out of the ice]. Then recite the words "A man needs a maid" three times. Alright [struggles to lift the maid]. Here we go! [to Jake] Help help help help help help help! [puts one end of the maid on Jake's back, and a fart noise is heard]
Jake: Lower it!
Finn: Ledge ledge ledge! [puts down the maid on the ledge] Ok! Focus my intention. [looks at Ice Finn]
Farmworld/Ice Finn: Just a few more jewels before I can open the portal to a better world!
Finn: My intention to heal the madness of this other self.
Jake: Wait, wait, wait. I don't think that's what we're supposed to do. Prismo said take care of him.
Finn: Yeah, that means make him feel better.
Jake: Are you being stupid on purpose?
Finn: Yeah, but dude, that is me!
Finn Sword: That's me!
Jake: I heard you the first time!
Finn: There's gotta be something else we can do.
Jake: Bro, you heard Prismo, we don't have a choice.
Finn: [inhales and exhales] Ok, but you do it! I just can't man i- it's too messed up.
Jake: Alright, you're right. Shut your eyes and cover your ears!
Finn: [Closes eyes and covers ears] Mamamamamamama.
Jake: [exhales] A man needs a maid [shows Ice Finn]. [Exhales and wipes sweat off his face] A man... needs... a maid. A maaaaan [shows Ice Finn], needs... a... [shows Jake with a ton of sweat on his face]. Nope! This is bull juice!
Prismo: [still in time room] Oh, flip!
Finn: Mamamamama-
Jake: hey, hey!
Finn: Did you do it?
Jake: Nah man! Let's just go steal the Enchiridion.
Finn: Woah yeah! That way he can't open the portal and nobody gets obliterated! [shows Prismo watching from the Time Room] That should work!
Prismo: That's not gonna work you guys! Don't walk away from the maid! NOOOOO!
Farmworld/Ice Finn: [holding some ice blocks with people in them with his ice magic] It's gonna be so great in the next place, guys! It's like we're spinning, spinning, spinning into the new land! [shows Finn and Jake sneaking towards the Enchiridion] Hahahahahahahaha! Woohoo! Hahahahaha! [Finn is walking to the Enchiridion]
Finn: [pulls on the Enchiridion] Sneaky fashion! [the Enchiridion is not moving, Farmworld/Ice Finn blasts Finn and Jake away]
Farmworld/Ice Finn: What's this? Oh! Two more converts to my empire of frost!?
Jake: Finn, I love you! Just in case we eat it fighting this guy.
Finn: Oh, yeah, I love you too.
Farmworld//Ice Finn: Hahahahahahaha! [shoots ice fireworks] Wonderful! I thought I'd rescued all the humans! Now you can hang out here with everyone else! Gunther says we just need a few more gems. Anyway, now I'm going to freeze you!
Jake: WAIT! [stretches]
Farmworld/Ice Finn: Huh?!
Jake: Straight up magic!
Farmworld/Ice Finn: Are you a wizard too?!
Jake: Yeah, check out my amazing wizard bod! [Farmworld/Ice Finn looks at Finn] Hey over here man, look at me! I'm a portal to another world. [shapeshifts into a portal]
Farmworld/Ice Finn: You can't be!
Jake: I'm magic, I can do anything! Don't you believe your own eyes? [Finn is sneaking towards the Enchiridion. Farmworld/Ice Finn is distracted by Jake]
Farmworld/Ice Finn: Why would you be able to turn in-
Jake: Why anything? Why's the sky blue, bro? That's right, just keep looking at me!
[Finn looks towards Bobby]
Bobby: Hey, what's up?
Finn: I'll get you out of this, Billy!
Bobby: [whispering] It's Bobby. [looks around] Look out!
Finn: [looks at Big Destiny walking in] Who's that?
Jake: Enter the por- What? Big Destiny?
Big Destiny: [drops a brown bag, jewels come out] Jewels! [drools from his mouth]
Finn: What's wrong with him? He looks possessed or somethi- [shows Farmworld Lich in Farmworld Jake's body, walking] ooh, boy, here we go!
Jake: That's my body, dog!
Farmworld/Ice Finn: My friend you return! Hahahahaha! This was all his idea!
Jake: Come on, that's the lich! He's evil! And he's not even trying to hide it, bro!
Farmworld Lich: Release!
Big Destiny: [released from the lich's mind-control] Big D's mind is back! Wooo! [running] I must escape, first try! [Farmworld/Ice Finn freezes him]
Finn: [holding the Enchiridion] Uhhhh!
Farmworld/Ice Finn: [sees Finn] What are you doing!? [shoots ice at him]
Finn: Woah! [dodges ice]
Farmworld/Ice Finn: Traitor! [shoots more ice]
Finn: Jake, let's book it! [frozen in ice, his hands out of the ice, still holding the Enchiridion]
Farmworld/Ice Finn: You dirty gangsters!
Jake: We're not a gang! [Farmworld Lich approaches] That's you! [sees Farmworld Lich] AAAHHH! [tries to punch Farmworld Lich by stretching his fist, but Farmworld Lich stretches to catch the fist]
Farmworld Lich: Sleep!
Jake: [being held by the lich, falls asleep, with green in his eyes]
Farmworld/Ice Finn: [trying to take Enchiridion from Finn] Gimme! [takes book]
Farmworld Lich: Bring the book.
Farmworld/Ice Finn: Ok, buddy! Are we gonna save the world now?
Farmworld Lich: Bobby!
Bobby: [groans, and shoots a blue laser from his nose to the Enchiridion]
Farmworld/Ice Finn: Open, oh great book! [the book opens, and the jewels float to their spots] The final hole is mine! [takes the big ruby from the crown, and places it in the final spot] To put my thing in! [The book shoots a laser into the pool of green liquid]
Farmworld Lich: [maniacally] Hahahaha!
Farmworld/Ice Finn: Hahahahaha! What dimension is this? [looking at portal]
Farmworld Lich: All of them!
Farmworld/Ice Finn: That's great! Then we can live everywhere!
Farmworld Lich: Everywhere you will die!
Farmworld/Ice Finn: [nervously] Heh, what?
Farmworld Lich: You, your family, everyone will die. [Farmworld/Ice Finn frowns] Over and over! Mountains of broken bodies, beneath the wheel! [breathes black gas towards Jake. Jake starts to wake up]
Jake: Huh, what the? [black gas goes down his throat]
Finn: JAKE! Woah, what the? [the thorn from his arm wiggles] AHHHHHHHH! [the thorn chops off Farmworld Lich's hand, which falls to the ground along with Jake]
Jake: [pushes the Lich's hand off of him and into the portal] Gross!
Farmworld/Ice Finn: You used me!
Jake: Woah!
Farmworld/Ice Finn: I trusted you lich! [the Lich's hand travels into every universe]
Jake: Mathematical!
BMO: [sitting on the table, when a green portal opens above him] Huh? [the Lich's hand falls onto him]
Farmworld/Ice Finn: Freeze! [nothing happens] What? My power, it's gone! [Farmworld Lich jumps to attack Farmworld/Ice Finn, but Jake stretches over him]
Jake: Hang on Finn! AAAHHHHH!
Farmworld/Ice Finn: [panting, then pulls the ruby out from the Enchiridion. The portal is deactivated]
Jake: [Farmworld Lich is trying to get out of Jake] OW! OW!
Farmworld/Ice Finn: [puts ruby back in his crown] YES! The frost! [Finn's grass arm slaps him away from the crown]
Finn: [talking to his grass arm] Dude, don't kill him! [his grass arm breaks the ice he was stuck in] That's me, kinda. Other Finn, just listen at me. Your name is Finn Mertens! You're best friend is Jake the dog! You have a birthmark like a flaming sideways teardrop! In, like, a really weird place!
Farmworld/Ice Finn: What? What's going on? Bartrum?
Finn: Yeah, yeah! Your whole thing is you wanna help people, remember? We can fix all this.
Jake: [Farmworld Lich is struggling to get out of him] It's like the most evil heartburn!
Finn: JAAAAKE! Get out of the way! [holding the maid. Jake gets off of Farmworld Lich]. A man needs a maid, a man needs a maid, a man needs a maid!
The Maid:  Ding! Housekeeping! [shoots the lich]
Farmworld Lich: AAAAAAAHHHHHH!
[Shows the ice fortress from the outside, and a big pink beam shoots out of it. Prismo, still watching from the time room, exhales in relief.]
Farmworld Jake: [now a regular dog] Bark bark bark!
Jake: You're Welcome! Ha, I don't know what he's saying. Let's bounce. [is sent back to time room]
Finn: Prismo, wait! [to Farmworld/Ice Finn] We have so much to talk about [is sent back to the time room]. Oh. Prismo, I'm sorry if this is breaking the rules but you gotta help this guy out. He's just always gonna be messed up with that crown around. [Farmworld/Ice Finn angrily throws the crown at the ground, then the video pauses]
Prismo: Ok, I can try rearranging some stuff. Just a quick cut, [Prismo sends the crown back to the Ice King's skeleton right when the mushroom bomb explodes, destroying the crown] aaaaaaand, paste! There! Now the ground zero bomb explosion should destroy the crown in that reality, aaaaaaaand, play! So yeah, this all goes down again, bomb goes off, so yeah! The crown is totally gone. [shows Farmworld/Ice Finn, now brought back to normal] Your guy here goes back to normal. [Farmworld Finn gets his family out of the ice, and starts hugging them]
Jake: D'aaawwwww!
Finn: Huh, that's his family.
Jake: Hey look how dumb I am in that world. Here's me. Woof woof woof! Hahahahaha! I eat stuff off the ground. I don't know, what are dogs even into these days?
