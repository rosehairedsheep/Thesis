[Episode starts in Candy Kingdom. Scene is set in the evening]
Finn:  Birthday boy-e-e-e!
Princess Bubblegum:  Enjoying your party?
Finn:  It's great having fun with all my friends. Well, some of my friends mostly Banana Guards.
Princess Bubblegum:  Yeah, sorry about that. The Candy Kingdom is in full lockdown until I can sort out the rumors about my Uncle Gumbald. He's been gone for years, but we should stay vigilant.
Finn:  Don't worry, PB. Now that I'm 17, I'm feelin' ready for anything. Feels like I'm really hitting my stride, y'know?
Marceline:  Finn, I want to give you your gift before I forget. It's a harmonica.
Finn:  Awesome! [Inhales deeply]
BMO:  Finn, I designed an exciting new game for you.
Finn:  Show me.
BMO:  It's called "Birthday Boyfighter. [Game music plays]
Finn:  Looks like another hit.
Starchy:  Finn, Starchy didn't get you squat.
Huntress Wizard:  I got you a present too. It has emotional and metaphorical significance.
Finn:  It's beautifully wrapped. Wonder what it is.
Huntress Wizard:  It's an elk's heart.
Finn:  Oh, cool. I don't have one of those.
[Thumping]
Finn:  What's that sound?
Starchy:  It's zombies.
Huntress Wizard:  Sounds like hooves.
Starchy:  Zombie cows.
[Green Knight busts open the door]
Finn:  You're green!
 Green Knight:  I'm the Green Knight! And before you ask, yes, of course, I brought you a birthday present. It's a battle axe.
Finn:  That's some axe. Am I an axe guy though? I've always thought of myself as a sword guy.
Green Knight:  But only if you play me a game for it.
Finn:  What's the game?
Green Knight:  Oh, this game is called "All you have to do is strike me with it, and it is yours."
Finn:  Mm? [Inhales deeply] I can't axe some stranger. Wait a minute! Where's Jake? I know what's going on.
Princess Bubblegum:  No, I don't think you do.
Finn:  Relax, Princess. Jake loves playing birthday pranks on me.
unidentifiable Banana Guard:  Yes, of course One of Jake's classic pranks.
Finn:  Okay, I'm in.
Green Knight:  May your aim be steady.
Finn:  [Laughs] Sure thing Jake! [Finn decapitates The Green Knight] I win!
Everyone:  [Cheers]
Banana Guards:  Yeah, Finn! Yeah, Finn!
Jake:  Happy birthday, Finn.
Finn:  [Shrieks] Jake! When did you Whose head did I Are you pranking me?
Jake:  What? No. My prank is this fake-out gift. Huh?
[Green Knight fixes head back on]
Jake:  What's this guy's deal?
Princess Bubblegum:  Oh, nuh-uh! Banana guards, surround him! And be on the lookout for anything else strange!
Banana Guards:  Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup! Surrender, please.
[Green Knight extends vine/tentacle like appendages and grabs Banana Guards with them]
Unidentifiable Banana Guard:  Princess, is that strange?
Princess Bubblegum:  Yes!
Unidentifiable Banana Guard:  I did good.
Banana Guards:  [Screams as they get thrown around]
Princess Bubblegum:  My guards!
Finn:  I got this. Raah! [Axe handle turns into an eel and hisses] Eel!
Marceline:  [Marceline turns into her beast form] Get him!
Jake:  [Shouts] [Groans] Aw.
Huntress Wizard:  He might have an invisible shield. But I'm not sure, because it's invisible.
Jake:  Owiee. Yes. It's an invisible shield.
Princess Bubblegum:  An invisible shield. I've got a device for the dissolution of invisible shields.
[Whirrs, beeps] [Malfunctions]
Princess Bubblegum:  Impossible.
Green Knight:  [Laughs maniacally] Heh!
Princess Bubblegum:  Back off, everyone. He's using some advanced mystery tech.
Green Knight:  [Laughs maniacally]
Princess Bubblegum:  Okay, let's talk.
Green Knight:  [Laughs maniacally] What do you want to talk about?
Princess Bubblegum:  Where did you come from? Why are you playing this weird game with Finn?
Green Knight:  [Laughs maniacally] [Laughing continues]
Princess Bubblegum:  He's playing Mr. Laughing Silent Guy.
Finn:  Game's over, bro.
Green Knight:  The game isn't over until I strike you.
Finn:  Hmm. Let's come up with a better way to settle this, like reasonable late teens.
Green Knight:  I'm listening.
Finn:  Well, we've got everything set up for party games. How about if I beat you two out of three, you got to answer our questions.
Princess Bubblegum:  Psst! Nuh!
Green Knight:  And if I win chop, chop.
Finn:  Deal.
Princess Bubblegum:  Wait, Finn, I think he's plotting something.
Finn:  I-It's fine. I'm 17. I'm hittin' my stride.
[Forcefield activates, everyone except Finn and the Green Knight gets swept away]
Finn:  Hey, Green Knight, why are they all mimey?
Green Knight:  Ah, just to keep things fair.
[Hitting forcefield] [Sighs]
Princess Bubblegum:  I don't think he can hear us.
Green Knight:  [Laughs ominously]
Finn:  Okay, guy. Why don't we start with something basic like balls and coconuts. Hup! Hup! Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup. Ba-ba-ba-boom! Boom!
Everyone:  [CHEERING] Okay, Finn! Yeah, yeah! You got it, Finn! You go, boy!
Finn:  [Slow motion] Boooooooom! [Horse Belches] [Slow motion ends] Aw, what? I'll let you have that one, 'cause I'm a big boy today. But let's see you try and beat four out of five, huh?
[Whirring]
Green Knight:  How do you like them coconuts?
Finn:  [Mutters to himself] I hate them coconuts.
Princess Bubblegum:   Something's wrong.
Marceline:  Yeah, I swear that looked fake.
Huntress Wizard:  It was. I saw it all with my Huntress vision. Finn is totally getting played.
Finn:  [Inhales deeply] All right. You got a freaky curveball, man. But can you climb a greasy pole?
Starchy:  A greasy pole?! It's hard enough climbing a non-greasy pole!
Finn:  Ready?
Green Knight:  [Chuckles] Mm-hmm!
Finn:  One, two, three, go! [Grunts] Ha, ha! [Panting]
[Green Knight begins slow clapping]
Finn:  Huh?
Green Knight:  Finn, you climb so good. I guess you win this round.
Princess Bubblegum:  Hmm.
BMO:  Yay, Finn!
Marceline, Huntress Wizard, BMO And Starchy:  Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Jake:  That's right! Yay, yay! Now's our chance, BMO.
BMO:  I-Is Finn gonna be okay?
Jake:  He's got this. He's 17.
Finn:  Who's the ma-a-an? Who's the 17-year-old ma-a-a-an? [Finn rips off his shirt] Hoo! You've been a good sport, so I'll let you choose the tiebreaker.
Bubblegum, Marceline, Starchy and Huntress Wizard:  [Muffled] Don't do it! Wait, don't do it! Not a good idea!
Green Knight:  Very well. Hmm How about a game of some good old-fashioned arm wrestling?
Finn:  Arm wrestling, huh? I see what you did there. My guns are obviously weak as heck from climbing that greasy pole. If only I had some kind of [Whirrs] superhuman robot arm. Bam!
Green Knight and Finn at same time:  Three, two, one, go!
Finn:  [Strained cry] Ahh!
Green Knight:  You can't tell from my face, but I am smiling triumphantly.
Finn:  Nooo! It's my birthday!
Green Knight:  I know. It's my birthday, too.
Finn:  Fern?
[The Green Knight grabs Finn by his arm and swings him at the table, Finn breaks through the table]
Bubblegum, Marceline, Starchy and Huntress Wizard:  Oh, no! No! Finn!
Green Knight:  [Chuckles] Finally, I win! [The Green Knight approaches Finn ready to swing his axe at him]
Gumbald:  Fern! We've seen enough.
Finn:  [Groans]
Bubblegum, Marceline, Starchy and Huntress Wizard:  Finn! Finn! Finn, are you all right?
Starchy:  I love you, Finn!
Huntress Wizard:  Quick, eat this elk's heart.
Princess Bubblegum:  What is this?
Gumbald:  It's a family reunion.
Princess Bubblegum:  Uncle Gumbald, Cousin Chicle, Aunt Lolly. How are you back?!
Gumbald:  Here's a hint [Mimics Lumpy Space Princessâ€™s voice] "Oh, my glob".
Princess Bubblegum:  Lumpy Space Princess. [Bubblegum remembers happenings from [(Elements]] miniseries where LSP reverts Ooo back to normal] When she reset Ooo, she reset you.
Gumbald:  For 800 years, you kept us imprisoned, Princezzin.
Princess Bubblegum:  No, you were happier as candy people.
Gumbald:  We thought we were. But don't worry it's your turn to be happy now. Get juiced.
[Marceline in her beast form jumps in front of Bubblegum]
Marceline:  [Hisses] Back off, gumwad!
Gumbald:  The vampire girl is legitimately scary. Very well. You've witnessed our superior technology and watched your champion crushed.
Finn:  [Vomits]
Gumbald:  We'll go for now.
Green Knight:  [Laughs]
Finn:  This is my worst B-day ever.
Everyone:  [Singing] Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you
