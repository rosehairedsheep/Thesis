[morning in the tree house. Finn is uncomfortable in his bed.]
Finn: [groans]
[there is a sea lard in his bed]
Finn: Eww! The sea lard’s in my bed again. Gross.
Jake: Dude. That’s like the 8th time. Why don’t you just get rid of it?
Finn: I don’t know what’s gotten into it lately.
Jake: It's gross as butts, man. We’re taking care of this right now.


[Finn and Jake carry the sea lard outside]
Finn: I can’t believe we never thought of this before. The pond is the perfect place for a sea lard.
Jake: See ya larder!
[Finn and Jake throw the sea lard into the pond. It sinks.]


Jake: [perplexed] Huh.
Finn: Is he, like, okay?
[Shelby climbs out of under Finn’s armpit]
Shelby: Well, seeing as sea lards are saltwater fish, and the pond is a freshwater environment…[inhales sharply] ...no? He’s a stenohaline fish. Haven’t you guys ever heard of osmoregulation? Allow me to explain.
[Finn takes his pajamas off. Shelby falls.]
Shelby: [shrieks] Waaaa! 
Finn: Sorry Shelby. Gotta save the lard.
[Finn holds his breath and jumps in. Jake follows. They swim to the bottom of the pond.]


Jake: [underwater] Thar!
Finn: [underwater] Wa?
[The lard floats into an underwater hole. Finn and Jake follow.]
[The lard emerges from the water. The frames show a massive structure of mud.]


Water Nymphs: [singing in harmony] ♫♪♪Smash the frogs, smash the frogs, making frog hot dogs, smash the frogs…..♫♪♪
Finn: [Looking around, amazed] Whoa!
Water Nymph (Denise): [Emerges from behind a structure] Finn and Jake! [to other water nymphs] Yo! Finn and Jake are here!
Water Nymphs #2 and #3: ♫♪♪Smash the frog - [interrupted, face Finn and Jake holding rolling pins] Hi!
Finn: So, this is where you guys live?
Water Nymphs #2 and #3: Yeah!
Water Nymph #2: We’re the guardians of this grotto.
Water Nymph (Denise): You guys want to stay for lunch? We’re making hot dogs!
Finn and Jake: [both, excited] Hot dogs?!?!
Finn: [realizing] Oh, wait. We dropped our sea lard in the pond, and we’ve got to save it before it dies from the freshwater. He’s a stenohaline fish.
[The Water Nymphs look at each other]
Water Nymph #3: You do know sea lards are mammals, right?
Finn: [embarrassed] Uhh.. I definitely knew that. [To Jake, whispering] I’m gonna murder Shelby.
Water Nymph (Denise): Well, hey, you guys should stick around. I’m gonna go finish cooking. 
Water Nymphs #2 and #3: [both] And we gotta mash more frogs.
[The water nymphs leave]


Finn: I can’t believe I just believe Shelby ‘cause he’s a nerd.
Jake: [agreeing] I know. It's in his tone. [Jake looks to the left] Hey, it's the lard!
Finn: [yelling to the lard] Hey, get away from there!
[The lard sinks into a whirlpool. It gasps for breath.]
Finn: [scoldingly] Bad lard! Lard!!
[water nymph (Denise) emerges from the water.]
Water Nymph (Denise): [hears Finn and Jake] Huh? [realizes, yelling] Don’t go near there! It’s too dangerous!
Finn: [yelling] Got to save this dang lard!
Water Nymph (Denise): [yelling] Whatever you do, don’t touch the purple stuff!
[Finn and Jake get sucked in the whirlpool]
Finn: [yelling] WHOOAH!
[The setting changes to a different dimension, where Finn and Jake are portrayed with a simpler, different art style]


[Finn wakes up on the ground, coughing]
Finn: [perplexed] What did she say? Don’t touch the purple?
[Jake wakes up, groaning]
Finn: [perplexed] What happened to the pond?
Jake: And how ‘bout our treehouse? The house part’s a-gone! 
[a pink pond is shown, as well as a house-less treehouse]
Finn: [perplexed] What the butt?
Jake: I guess we went through some portal to the past or some biz.
Finn: [perplexed] Was stuff the wrong color in the past?
[The wind blows with a strange effect]
Finn: [scratching his chin] It's weird as carbs here.
Jake: [looking around, yelling] The sea lard! [Jake points] There it goes!
Finn: [yelling] Lard!
[Finn and Jake run toward the lard. The frame pans to show an alternate dimension Finn and Jake, who begin to lick from the pink pond. The pond forms a face and speaks with Princess Bubblegum’s voice.]
Pond: [giggling] Hello, friends!
[Finn and Jake continue chasing the sea lard in the woods] 
Finn: [calling] Lard! Lard! Lard! Lard! Lard!
Jake: Lard, lard, lard, lard, lard


Finn:  [singing] ♫♪♪La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la laaaa!♫♪♪
Jake: You are crazy. You are so crazy!
[Finn and Jake continue walking]
Finn: [looking around] Everything’s like, wonky here. It’s familiar, but weird.
Jake: [smiling] I like it.
Finn: I don’t know. It kind of makes me feel… naked. [Finn sees the lard and gasps.]♫♪♪ La-la-la laaaard!♫♪♪
[Finn grabs the lard]
Finn: Gotcha! Finally, we can take you home!
[lights capture Finn and Jake’s attention.]


Finn and Jake: [perplexed] Huh?
[Alternate dimension Marceline (Leaf Marceline] is playing her bass and singing a melancholy song with two other leaves.]
Leaf Marceline: [singing "Flower Song"]♫♪♪A one-and a-two- I’d rather be anything but me, a leaf on a tree, a bug or a bee. I just want to see the sea, I want to be free from this body, this flower body.♫♪♪


Finn: [In awe] Please don’t change. You’re perfect just the way you are.
Leaf Marceline: Oh, I know! I just like to write sad songs.
Finn and Jake: [understanding] Ohh! [they chuckle.]
Finn: Wait. Hey, Jake, what were we just doing?
Leaf Marceline: [interrupting, singing] ♫♪♪Chasin’ the fish, Chasin’ the fish, and its getting away♫♪♪[Leaf Marceline points] 
Finn: [Turns around, yelling]
[Finn and Jake run away]


Leaf Marceline: [waving] Bye! [To other leaves] You guys are writing this down, right?
[Finn and Jake run]
Finn: Why does the lard keep running away? We're trying to get it home.
Jake: Yeah, this place ain't safe.
[A purple sparkle hits Finn's face. Then, it begins to come down like rain.]
[Princess Purple Patch (Ice King) is humming a tune.]
Princess Purple Patch: [singing] ♫♪♪bum-bum-bum, little purple, you're a catch, I love your pretty purple sash. We're a perfect purple match, Welcome to my purple patch♫♪♪!
Princess Purple Patch: I'm Princess Purple Patch, and this is my little special Purple. [They kiss the purple] Mwah!
Jake: [waves] Hi, Purple. I'm Ginn and he's Fake. Hmm.. Thats not right. He's Ginn, and I'm... wait...
Princess Purple patch: I'ma call you Purple Face! You want to come play in my purple place? 
[Jake gets reminded of what the water nymph said to him before.]
Water Nymph (Denise): [echoes, warning] Don't touch the purple stuff!
Jake: [To Finn] Weren't we supposed to not do something with the purple things?
Finn: [confused] Hm?
Princess Purple Patch: Oh, you want purple? Here, take some for the road!
[Princess Purple Patch tosses some purple toward Finn and Jake. Finn and Jake become affected by the purple, and enter a childlike state.]
Princess Purple Patch: [sadly] Oh, dear, I've purpled you.
[They begin to cry and fly away.]
Princess Purple Patch: [sadly] Why do I always do this? 
Purple: [casually] Later.
[Finn and Jake continue to play in the purple.]
Jake: [pleasantly] Heh! What a great gal.
Finn: Yeah. [pleasantly] Purple! [confused] Wait- what were we just doing? We were.... We were.... Who are we?
Jake: I don't know, man. [Playing in the purple] But I like these things.
Finn: [Trying to remember.] Foon. I'm--- I'm Foon. [groaning] I'm.. [smiling obliviously] Fine.
[Finn notices Jake grunting on the ground.]


Finn: Huh? Ja-- Ja-- Jaaauump!
[Finn jumps in front of jake]
Finn: Hello. Are you a lost dog? I am boy.
Jake: Uh.. maybe?
Finn: We are boy and dog.
Jake: I'm petting the ground, boy.
Finn: Looks like fun.
[Finn get on the ground and sniffs it.]
Finn: And it smells like toast.
[Finn and Jake notice Bush Boots (Tree Trunks) crying in the distance.]
Finn: Huh? Crying. Long nose. 
Finn and Jake: [exclaiming and posing] Investigate!
[Bush Boots continues to cry]
Finn: [speaking to Bush Boots] Miss, your crying indicates you're in need of help.
Bush Boots: What? [sniffles] Yes. I've lost my rolling pin.
Finn: Understood. What's your name, miss?
Bush Boots: I'm Bush Boots, the little apricot anteater [begins to bawl]
[Finn and Jake approach Bush Boots and embrace her.]
Finn and Jake: Hugs!
Bush Boots: [wiping tears] The hugs helped my crying, but it didn't help me find my rolling pin.
Finn: Boy and dog will find your rolling pin. [looking around] Where did you last see it?
Bush Boots: It was rolling around here not too long ago.


[The sea lard rolls across the screen]
Bush Boots: Oh, there it goes!
[Finn and Jake begin to chase it, with bush boots far behind]
Bush Boots: Come back, you bad little rolling pin!
[The sea lard/rolling pin hides in the bushes.]
Finn: Bush Boots, lets sneak up on it.
[They roll toward the sea lard stealthily, and capture it.]
Jake: [wrestling with the sea lard] Am-boosh!
Bush Boots: [happy] Oh, you caught it! Wonderful!
[the next scene is at Bush Boots' home. Bush boots is struggling to hold the "rolling pin".
Bush Boots: [struggling] Come on, now. Just roll the dough.
[The sea lard jumps out of her hands and flops around. Everyone gasps.]
Bush Boots: [sadly, upset] Oh, its getting away again!
Finn: Ma'am, I think that rolling pin is sentient.
Jake: [Agreeing] Yeah, I don't think it wants to be a rolling pin.
Finn: Dog, we have to save that rolling pin from this sweet lady. [Finn looks around] Where did it go?
[The sea lard shows itself, and rolls away. Finn and Jake run after it.]
Finn: [yelling] Rolling pin! We want to help!
[As Finn and Jake run away, Bush Boots' home becomes a train, and rolls away. Finn and Jake can't follow the sea lard's trail.]
Finn: No more.. Slime.
Jake: Rolling pin trail has gone cold.


[A bee (Bee-mo) begins to buzz around them.]
Finn: A bee. 
Jake: I see.
Bee: A poem by me. Listen for a sound and look around.
Unless egress is sought, smiles will not be found.
Finn and Jake: [confused] Hmm?
Bee: It's a metaphor.
[The bee flies away and Finn and Jake follow it. They approach the pink pond from before.]
Jake: A pink pond.
Finn: Pink pond? Pretty!
Pink pond: [Giggles] Hee hee! Hello, friends!
Jake: The pond has a face and is talking to us.
Finn: [in awe] Yeah.
Pink pond: [inviting] Dive in.


[The pink pond turns into a whirlpool.]
Finn: I don't feel comfortable diving into a face.
[The sea lard approaches from behind them.]
Finn: Dog, lets go back for apricot pie.
Jake: [excited] Yeah, pie!
[The sea lard pushes Finn and Jake into the pool.]
Jake: Gross!
Finn: [exclaiming] Whoaaa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[The sea lard jumps in after them.]


[Finn and Jake return to normal Ooo, and are inside the treehouse. Ice King is staring through their window. Jake is speaking to BMO]
Jake: And then there was like, a PB puddle, a Marceline plant, and a little bee that looked like you, BMO! You know what? We didn't save the sea lard. The sea lard saved us.
BMO: Yay, sea lard!
Ice King: [on windowsill] Wow, what an adventure.
Jake: [Turns around] And there was even a purple lady kind of like you, Ice King! She even sounded just like you.
Ice King: She sounds magnificent! How'd you say you got there?
Jake: We didn't. Beat it, creep.
Ice King: I'll figure it out.
[Ice King flies away. Finn approaches the window]
Finn: But Simon, if you go there, you'll lose you memories.
Ice King: What memories? I'm like a goldfish over here.


[Ice King looks away]
Jake: [curious] In what way, exactly?
[Ice King notices Jake]
Ice King: Oh, hey Jake. [exclaiming] Where am I?
[The scene changes to nightfall. Finn is putting the sea lard into bed.]
Finn: Comfy, dude? I bet you ran away 'cause we didn't appreciate you and called you gross and stuff. But you're not gross. [Finn kisses the sea lard] Mwah! Goodnight, sea lard.
[the sea lard closes his eyes and begins to sleep.]
