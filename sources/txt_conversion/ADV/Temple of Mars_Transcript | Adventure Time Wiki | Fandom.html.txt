[The episode opens with Finn carrying two plastic bags full of eggs towards the Tree Fort.]
Finn: [Grunts as he opens the door with his foot, then opens the fridge with his foot and begins pouring in the eggs.] Boiled eggs. In the fridge.
[Jermaine is sat at the table. He clears his throat. Finn bangs his head on the fridge door and scatters boiled eggs over the floor.]
Finn: Jake! You're back! I've missed you so mu- Oh.
Jermaine: Uh, hi Finn. It's just me.
Finn: Jermaine! You and Jake both have sort of a grapefruit nature to you.
Jermaine: I came to your playhouse because I'm worried about Jake.
Finn: Don't worry, he's fine. He left a note.
[Finn holds up Jake's note. It reads "BRB - Jake".]
Jermaine: How long ago did he leave that?
Finn: Uh, I dunno. Maybe five weeks?
Jermaine: [Groans and exhales sharply] Whoo. Finn, you know you can call me if you're in trouble, right? Our brother's missing, and I come here finding you doing a lazy man's load with a hundred boiled eggs.
Finn: It's all they have at the store.
Jermaine: [Sits on the floor] I'm just worried, 'cause I had a dream about Jake - a vision.
[A representation of Jermaine's vision is shown. A tiny Jake is shown on top of Jermaine's head. He is in space, emaciated and alone.]
Jermaine: I think he's all alone in outer space. I don't think he can come home, and he's running out of birthday cake and cocktail hot dogs.
[Jake falls onto his side and the vision ends.]
Finn: Jake's in space?!
Jermaine: [Brushing something off his head] I know! It's chilling.
Finn: Hmm. Oh! So, this cosmic stuff, planets and space... [He begins writing a note. A pen lid in his mouth muffles his speech.] This is Normal Man-type subjects. [He spits out the lid and slaps the note onto the fridge alongside Jake's. It reads "BRB - Finn".] We're going to Mars!
Jermaine: Mars?! [Grunts and gets up.] Is it too much to hope that "Mars" is the name of some bookstore you like?
[The scene changes. Finn and Jermaine approach the house where Normal Man used to live.]
Jermaine: Is that a boat? I haven't seen a boat in years.
[They enter the house. Tiny Manticore is sat on a shelf listening to a cassette player.]
Jermaine: Ah, this is a pretty old house. What's that on the shelf? A little pegasus?
[They continue into the basement.]
Jermaine: Into the basement. Sure is lots of broken glass and decay down here. I'll be honest - I was just talking a lot because I'm nervous.
Finn: [Grabs the handles of the Martian transporter.] I know.
[Finn gestures to Jermaine, and Jermaine climbs onto his chest.]
Finn: [Whispering] Jake.
[The transporter whirs to life and sends them both out of the atmosphere in a beam of light. They pass through a cluster of eggs in space and then touch down on Mars. Jermaine screams the entire way.]
Jermaine: [Whimpers, panting, coughs, then speaks hoarsely] Mars.
[Finn and Jermaine walk past some Martians cleaning statues of Margles.]
Finn: Dang. Looking real prosperous around here.
Jermaine: Who's the statues, do you think?
Finn: Maybe Margles? But I've only seen a photo of her. Wait! Betty?
[Betty is standing by a pile of sand and a huge hole. She uses a pair of tweezers to drop a grain of sand into the hole.]
Betty: Oh, Finn. Uh, how is-
Finn: I haven't seen you, Betty, since you double-crossed everyone.
Betty: I-
Finn: Ya slopped up!
King Man: Finn! Empathy! [He climbs out from the pile of sand.]
Finn: Normal Man.
King Man: Nay! King Man! [Bows and then puts his hand on Finn's shoulder.] Finn, Betty is tormented. Just look at her.
Finn: Oh.
Betty: I'm trying to get better. I'm filling this hole with sand - grain by grain. [She drops another grain into the hole.]
King Man: We're going to cure Betty's obsession with the Ice King and the magical madness inflicted upon her.
Betty: [Glitches out.] G-G-G-G-Gah
Finn: If you inflicted it on her, shouldn't you be filling the hole?
King Man: Empathy, Finn. [He noogies Finn.]
Finn: Aah!
[The scene changes. Finn, Jermaine, King Man, and Betty are walking down a canyon towards a large entranceway.]
King Man: Okay, so, Jake's in space.
Jermaine: Yeah.
King Man: And you don't know where in space.
Jermaine: Yeah.
King Man: And you don't know where in space, even though literally every single place in this dimension is [air quotes] "in space".
Jermaine: Again, yeah.
King Man: You are a real cutie. Okay, here we are. To locate Jake, you will need to retrieve our space telemetry capsule - deep within Mars at the end of a deadly three-part mind maze.
Jermaine: [Whimpers]
King Man: Don't fret, cowardly dog. Betty will go with you.
Betty: I... should really get back to my sand.
Finn: Nah. You should come with us.
King Man: Now, only Martians may enter the maze, so you'll need hats to fool the guard over there.
Jermaine: Okay, cool. Where are the hats?
King Man: Space.
Jermaine: Wha- Aw, come on, man!
[King Man winks and points to a nearby box full of hats.]
Jermaine: [Groans]
[Finn removes his normal hat to put on a Martian one, revealing that his head is shaven.]
Jermaine: Eeh!
Finn: [Talking to the guard.] Um, Door Man?
Guard Man: [Looking up from his book] I'm Guard Man.
Finn: Well, I am Boy Man.
Jermaine: Uh, and I'm... Jer Man.
Guard Man: Sure. [Looks back down at his book.]
Finn: [Whispering to Jermaine] "Jer Man" was really funny.
Jermaine: Thanks, Finn.
[They enter the maze and the door slams shut. They emerge into a room filled with water and strange frogs. Most of them have heads which resemble Ice King's crown.]
Finn: Hey Jermaine, get a load of these frogs. What do you think's going on with all these frogs, Jermaine? Jermaine?
Jermaine: What? I don't know.
[Finn spots a single frog whose head resembles Fern's hat.]
Finn: Oh, whoa. That one looks different - kinda... special.
[The Fern frog's eyes suddenly turn red. It hisses and leaps at Finn.]
Finn: Yip! [He ducks the frog.]
Fern frog: Remember!
[The frog falls into the water and out of sight.]
Finn: Whew!
Betty: Finn!
Finn: I'm okay. These guys mean business, though. If you look them in the eyes, they get outraged.
[As Finn is speaking, Betty looks at many of the Ice King frogs, and their eyes turn red.]
Finn: You got all that, Betty? Betty! Hup!
[Finn tackles Betty to the ground and the frogs fly overhead.]
Betty: Oh! There's more on this side.
Finn: [Growls] Hyup!
[Finn hoists Betty and Jermaine onto his back and runs to the end of the room as frogs continue to fly at them.]
Betty: Guys, I think I figured out the frog puzzle. [Jermaine pulls her hat over her mouth, and her speech is muffled.] It's really quite simple.
[They arrive at a structure made of ice where there is a blackboard full of mathematical symbols, and the Ice Thing is perched above.]
Betty: I found the next challenge! I think maybe if I solve this equation, we'll be able to pass through to the next chamber.
Finn: And if we mess up, that guy pecks our tummies open, right? [He gestures at the Ice Thing.]
Betty: No. See, the work is already full of errors. I just need to correct them.
Jermaine: Um, I'm not trying to complain or anything, but none of these puzzles have anything... to do with... me.
Betty: [Speaking over Jermaine] Look see? This quadrinomial has been improperly factored. He forgot to double cube root the bottom partial nominator. [She magically produces a piece of icy chalk and corrects the error on the blackboard.] There we go. I'll have us out of here in no time.
Finn: Well, just let me know if you need any help - with anything besides these maths problems.
Betty: [Muttering to herself] X plus square, hypotenuse cubed plus Y minus three... [Muttering continues.]
[Finn spots the error she corrected reverting back to its erroneous form.]
Finn: [Gasps]
Ice Thing: [Chuckles]
Finn: Hey! He's jukin' the stats!
Betty: What?
Finn: He's changing the dang numbers around!
Betty: He's changing. Oh no.
Finn: [Climbing towards the Ice Thing] Come on, Jermaine!
Jermaine: Up there? You're gonna break your neck!
Ice Thing: [Laughs and takes off.]
Finn: Hey!
[The ice structure snaps and Finn falls through the blackboard, screaming. It shatters and Finn, Jermaine, and Betty are transported to a white void.]
Finn: [Groans and rubs his head] If anyone else feels like solving any of these puzzles, just jump right in, you know?
Jermaine: Hey! Over here! I hear something.
[They approach a window which looks into a room where a past version of Betty is speaking to someone on the phone.]
Past Betty: ...if you water them once a week they'll totally be fine. No! I know! Six months studying ancient petroglyphs in the Outback?! [Squeals] I can't believe it! [Her conversation continues indistinctly in the background.]
Betty: That's me.
Jermaine: Uh-doy!
Finn: You looks so happy. And sane.
Betty: [Sighs] I was. But I never took that trip. I met Simon the next day, and he was just so amazing. I put everything on hold to help him search for the Enchiridion.
Jermaine: Listen, Betty, I may not be a psychiatrist or a life coach, or even know what you're talking about, but maybe you should try focusing on yourself a little more, you know?
Betty: Can I though? I spent so much time dedicated to Simon I'm not sure there's even any "me" left anymore.
Past Betty: Good point, Future Betty! Maybe it is too late to save you, but with your power and my joie de vivre-ay, maybe the two of us could save Simon together! Think about it.
Finn: Oh, come on, Betty! Get it together! Even if you are a lost cause, she-
Jermaine: -Or whatever she represents-
Finn: -is not.
Past Betty: Or am I? [Blinks innocently]
Betty: No, Finn's right. You'll thank me for this later, Past Betty.
[She magically changes the date on Past Betty's plane ticket so that it says "today" instead of "next week".]
Past Betty: Hmph.
[The room dissolves into static and then returns with Past Betty preparing to leave for her trip.]
Past Betty: [Speaking on the phone] And don't forget to water my plants. Okay, got to go! My flight leaves in an hour!
[She hangs up, and the room dissipates. There is a pop, and confetti falls from above into the white void.]
Finn: Good job, Betty.
Betty: Thanks, Finn. Sorry I couldn't be more help. I was a little preoccupied.
Jermaine: Oh really?
Finn: Anyway, where's the space thingy? [Chanting] Space thingy! Space thingy!
Jake: Space what-y?
Finn and Jermaine: Jake!
Jake: Hey everybody.
Finn: Hey, long time no see, brudda! [Scratches Jake's head.]
Jake: [Laughs] Hey, what's with the hair, brudda?
Finn: Man, you're lucky you missed it. I had lice crazy-bad! I think I got them from Marceline, who got them from Ice King.
[While Finn is talking, Jermaine, in horror, flashes back to all the times throughout the day where he has touched Finn's head.]
Jake: [Laughs] Nice.
Finn: Anyway, how'd you even get here?
Jermaine: Eugggh! [Drops the hats he is holding.]
Jake: Beats me. I was just eating a sausage on some stupid planet, then all of a sudden there was a beautiful rainbow explosion and a loud noise - sort of like a space telemetry capsule activating. Then here I was, standing next to this Mars door.
[An opening has appeared in the void, and King Man is standing on the other side of it, back in the canyon where they began. King Man blows a party horn as Finn, Jake, Betty, and Jermaine exit the maze.]
King Man: Congratulations, everybody. Now, who's ready for a nice boiled egg?
Finn: Me!
Jake: Me!
Jermaine: Wait a minute. What even happened in there? Where's the telemetry capsule?
King Man: Don't you see, Jermaine? You were inside the capsule all along, learning valuable lessons while you programmed its Jake-extracting telemetry with your minds.
Jermaine: Of course.
King Man: And you, Betty - finally you've learned that most pressing of lessons - that sometimes, for our own good, we must accept the loss of that which we hold most dear.
Betty: [Imitates a buzzer] I've learned that I just got to work even harder to get it back.
King Man: What?!
Betty: Like, did you see Finn in there? He was indomitable!
King Man: Yeah I guess but-
Betty: So as I stared into that endless white void, I came up with a plan.
King Man: A plan?
Betty: For me, to save my Simon, and for you, to finally pull Margles back from the maw of GOLB.
King Man: [Gulps] Marg-
