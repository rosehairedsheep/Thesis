[A yellow bird flies over a field, and lands on Raggedy Princess.]
Raggedy Princess:  Oh, hello bird. [laughs] Uh, I'm a scarecrow, see. But, I don't really want to scare you, so let me read you a poem instead. "Like a wilted flower, frail and bald. Rattled by the freezing autumn winds". [the bird flies away] Oh, I guess I'm very good at my job. But I do wish one of them would stay to hear the whole thing. [the frog begins walking by] Hi, frog! Did you come to hear my poems? They're kinda long, so you have to walk slow. Or I could just read it fast! "Late last night through fevered dreams, I heard some faint and feeble screams. They'll only last to likely leave. Was crying out in gruesome grief".
[Finn and Jake are seen following the frog.]
Finn:  We're still on his trail, Jake.
Raggedy Princess:  Oh, hi Finn! Did you hear the poem?
Finn:  Hey, Raggedy. We'd love to stay and chat, but we're kind of on a mission here. Maybe next time.
Raggedy Princess:  No, you're right Finn. A true poet doesn't need an audience. [the screen zooms in on the field, then moves up to the sky] "I stand alone beneath the bleary sky..."
[The screen pans down to Finn, Jake, and the frog in a muddy forest.]
Finn:  Shh, wait, he's gonna do it!
[The frog lifts the crown above his head, but the wind blows it into Jake's hands. Finn and the frog gasp]
Finn:  Jake, don't put on-
Jake:  Sorry, man.
[Jake puts on the crown. the Mud Frogs emerge from the mud and bow down to Jake.]
Jake:  They love me! [the mud frogs lift him up and carry him away] Whoop, ha ha!
Finn: [the frog jumps up and down angrily] Oh no, you made the frog angry. He's hopping mad. [laughs] C'mon man, give it back. [the frog starts crying]
[Finn walks over to Jake and the mud frogs. The frogs are still carrying jake, and they are also making a mud statue of him.]
Finn:  [annoyed] C'mon man, give it back.
Jake:  Nah, man, I like being the frog king. I'm gonna see where this leads, bro. [the frogs carry him away]
Finn:  [sighs, then looks toward the frog].
[The Tree Fort is shown on the outside. The screen then cuts inside where Finn is sitting on a bench, and BMO walks by. BMO gasps, and then the screen shows the frog sitting on the bench with Finn.]
