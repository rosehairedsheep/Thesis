BMO: One free-range Humpty Dumpty.
BMO: Sorry.
BMO: Fine aged cheddar man.
BMO: Homemade ketchup.
BMO: A fresh pepper fart
BMO: Dance, parsley.
BMO: Face bread.
BMO: Special sentient sandwich.
Jake: Mmm... Is that special sentient sammich?
BMO: Bingo.
BMO: Made by the BMO.
Jake: BMO, you're my little cherub.
Jake: You know that?
Jake: You made all this for me, right?
Jake: Aaahhh.
BMO: Not so fast, Jake!
Jake: Naaaw.
BMO: The sammiches are yours...
BMO: For a price.
Jake: What?
BMO: I need you to be my tiny horse for the day, so I can do my live-action cowboy role-play adventure.
Jake: No way.
Jake: Poo deal.
Jake: I'll do 20 minutes.
BMO: It took me over six hours to prepare this nosh, Jake!
BMO: Not to mention the time it took acquiring the ingredients through the "special market," putting my safety and my reputation on the line.
Jake: Okay, fine, fine.
Jake: Three sammiches for every hour I'm a horse.
BMO: Mm...
BMO: One sammich per horse-hour, six-hour minimum.
Jake: Deal.
BMO: Yippee-ki-yay!
Jake: Om!
Jake: Mm.
Jake: Oh, yeah.
Jake: It tastes alive.
BMO: Steed yourself, partner.
Jake: Okay.
Jake: Om.
Jake: 'Kay.
BMO: Oh, come on, man.
BMO: You didn't even try.
Jake: I did try.
Jake: Horses are hard.
Jake: How's that?
BMO: Eh, it reads.
BMO: Steady, girl.
Jake: Wha...
BMO: Shh, shh, shh.
BMO: I'm going to mount you now.
BMO: Hup!
BMO: Good girl.
Jake: So, what's the plan anyway, BMO?
BMO: The plan is to punch the toads to the stump and bring justice to the peeps!
Jake: Ow.
BMO: Oh, and by the way, Jake, from now on, you can call me... Angel Face.
BMO: Hyah!
Jake: Yow!
BMO: I used to be a guy who ran from Glob with the wind at my back and the devil on my shoulder.
BMO: Now I'm the guy chasing those guys, yet the devil is still here, sleeping in my couch.
Jake: BMO, that hurt when you dug your boots into my side belly.
Jake: Are you gonna apologize or...
BMO: Horses do not talk.
BMO: Over there! Hyah!
BMO: Whoa!
BMO: Jackrabbit Johnson.
BMO: This guy's wanted for stealing piglets from their mothers while they are feeding.
BMO: Makes me sick.
BMO: He was last seen in dead goat gulch.
BMO: What do you say, girl?
BMO: Want to catch this donkey and split the reward?
Jake: You have 45 minutes left before my next sammich.
BMO: Time's a-wasting!
Jake: Hyee!
BMO: Hmm.
Jake: BMO, I'm tired.
BMO: Looks like my horse needs a rest.
BMO: Slow down, horse.
BMO: ♪ Being a robot cowboy ♪
BMO: ♪ Is a lonely job ♪
BMO: ♪ But somebody has to protect the piglets ♪
BMO: ♪ I got nobody but my horse ♪
BMO: ♪ And my friend the cactus guy ♪
BMO: ♪ It's okay because I like them a lot ♪
BMO: ♪ That's okay, I like being a robot ♪
BMO: ♪ Cowboy ♪
BMO: Be careful, Jake.
BMO: This is where Jackrabbit Johnson's gang of lowlife bandits lays low.
BMO: Hyah!
BMO: Bang! Bang!
BMO: Put them up, partner!
BMO: Hyah!
BMO: Pyew, pyew!
BMO: Pyew, pyew, pyew!
BMO: I want answers!
BMO: [high voice] You can't do this to us!
BMO: No answers, eh?
BMO: No use to me!
BMO: How about you, frisco?
BMO: [high voice] I'm not going to talk.
BMO: Why am I talking to you then?!
BMO: Hooah!
BMO: Yah! Unh!
Neptr: BMO, what did you do?
BMO: It's Jackrabbit Johnson's right-hand man, Tumbleweed Terk.
Neptr: I spent the last three months building all of this.
Jake: Oh, that's where you been?
Neptr: Mm-hmm.
Neptr: BMO gave me a Finn Cake.
BMO: Don't talk to my horse, Tumbleweed.
Neptr: Aah.
BMO: Where is Jackrabbit Johnson?!
BMO: I know you know where he's headed.
Neptr: I don't know!
Neptr: Tumbleweed terk's always the last to know.
Neptr: It's just like I told the other bounty hunter, I swear.
BMO: I don't believe a word you say.
BMO: Now take a message to your compadre.
BMO: Tell him his pal, Angel Face, is itching to get together.
BMO: Tell Jackrabbit Johnson to meet me at Dirtwater Flats, just like the old days!
Neptr: Okay.
BMO: Sock citizens of dead goat gulch, we can rebuild!
Jake: Neigh!
Me-Mow: Grrr.
BMO: Uhh...
BMO: I don't remember where Dirtwater Flat is.
BMO: Better stop for the night.
BMO: We can make a campfire here.
BMO: And we will talk about what we will do with the reward money.
Jake: No.
Jake: It's been fun, BMO, but it's time to go home because there are no more sandwiches.
BMO: But I want to finish the adventure.
Jake: Which direction is the house?
BMO: I'm not sure.
BMO: Get down!
Me-Mow: Getting kicked out of the guild of assassins... check.
Me-Mow: Capturing my first bounty...
Me-Mow: Check.
Me-Mow: Going to Finn and Jake's treehouse and getting revenge...
Me-Mow: Unchecked.
Finn: Finn and Jake's treehouse?
Me-Mow: Mm-hmm.
Finn: Who are you, and why do you want to get revenge?
Me-Mow: I... Am... Me-Mow!
Finn: Me-Mow?! Whoa.
Finn: You've gotten bigger.
Me-Mow: Have we met before?
Jake: Finn, is that you?
BMO: That's Jackrabbit Johnson!
Me-Mow: Finn?
Me-Mow: It is Finn!
Me-Mow: Tricked again!
Jake: Look... It's me-mow, BMO.
BMO: I don't care.
BMO: That's my bounty!
BMO: Yaah!
BMO: Jake, transform...
BMO: Horse!
Jake: Whoa, did you have a real gun all this time?
BMO: I am old enough to vote.
Me-Mow: [thinking] Hey, Jake, if you can hear my internal monologue, I'm going to kill you!
BMO: Your Daisy days are over!
BMO: I am the whaler 'round these parts!
BMO: Huh.
Me-Mow: Sounds like you're out of ammo.
BMO: No, you heard incorrectly.
BMO: Bang, bang, bang!
Me-Mow: I'm coming for you!
Me-Mow: Ugh!
Me-Mow: Blast you, Finn and Jake and Angel Face.
Me-Mow: This prison cell's not going to hold me.
Finn: Oh?
Me-Mow: Hey, Finn and Jake! I'll get my revenge! You hear me?! Revenge!
Finn: Hey, BMO, are you sure you took down all the wanted posters?
BMO: Yes.
Armadillo: Stick 'em up.
Finn: Huh?
BMO: This bounty belongs to me!
BMO: Get out of here!
Armadillo: Yaah!
Finn: Thanks, BMO.
BMO: You're welcome.
