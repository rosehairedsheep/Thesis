[The episode opens at the Tree House.]
Jake: [Shouting] Finn?
"Finn": [Suddenly standing behind him.] Yo.
Jake: Oh, hey. Me and BMO are heading over to the vuvuzela store in the Music Kingdom. You want to come with? I got to get a new vuvuzela. Somebody keeps smashing my old one. [He pulls out a snapped vuvuzela and blows into it pathetically. BMO screams in terror at this horrible sound]
BMO: I can't bear this burden any longer! It was me! I'm the vuvuzela smasher!
Jake: BMO, how could you?
Neptr: No, it was me! I'm the vuvuzela smasher.
Jake: Neptr?!
"Finn": No, I'm the vuvuzela smasher.
Jake: All right, all right. Well, I'm still getting one. You coming?
"Finn": Nah, me and Fi- ...Fern are supposed to clean out the chicken coop today. And if anyone tries to stop me, I'll slash their flipping faces off.
Jake: True, true. Okay, well, I'll see you later then. Come on, BMO.
[Jake and BMO exit down the ladder. Neptr exits too.]
BMO: [From downstairs] Jake, I'm sorry! I really am the smasher!
Jake: [From downstairs] Ah, don't sweat it buddy.
[Suddenly, a second Finn pokes his head in from upstairs.]
Finn: [Laughs] Holy cow! Fern, that was perfect! [He jumps down.] Hyup! You're getting new powers like every day now. Let me see you do Jake - no, wait, Ice King! Do Ice King!
Fern: Ha, nah, man. [He shakes himself and his Finn disguise disappears.] Imitating uncool people infects you with their loserishness.
Finn: Oh. Yeah, that rings true. [He holds up a red bucket.] It's too bad you didn't develop any coop-poop-scooping skills. That coop is incredibly disgusting.
Fern: Actually, about that, I was thinking that, instead, maybe you and I could explore some secret ruins I found.
Finn: Secret ruins?! Sweet! Maybe we can still catch up with Jake and BMO! Or maybe Neptr could come! Hey, Neptr, you want to go on an adventure, buddy?!
Neptr: [From another room]Oh my glob! Hold on!
Fern: Actually, I was thinking maybe just you and me would go. Spend some quality time together, Finn and Fern style.
Finn: Yeah, okay. That actually even sounds like something Jake would want us to do. [Chuckles] Forget it, Neptr! [Singing] ♪ Dungeon surprise, right before my eyes, what a surprise, the dungeon surprise. ♪
[As Finn is leaving, Fern's eyes briefly change into someone else's, and he stares menacingly. The scene changes. Finn and Fern are walking through a savannah, playing rock paper scissors. They keep picking the same thing.]
Finn and Fern: [Together] One, two, three - shoot! Rock! One, two, three - shoot! Scissors!
Finn: [Chuckles] This is so weird. I can't tell if it's boring or fun.
Fern: Well, I can. It's boring. I want the thrill of victory! Who wants to be the same all the time?
Finn: Come on, man! You know you love it! Come on! One, two, three... Come on!
Fern: [Sighs]
Finn and Fern: [Together] One, two, three - shoot!
Fern: Rock.
Finn: Paper.
Fern: What?!
Finn: Whoa! I won this time.
Fern: What? But that's not fair! [Growls] Why is nothing ever fair?
Finn: Hey, Fern, it's just a game. Don't be so weird.
Fern: Don't-! ...Don't call me that.
Finn: [Inhales sharply, sensing he has crossed a line.] Sorry.
Fern: Ah, it's okay. That stuff won't mean a thing. I mean, that stuff don't mean a thing. Hey, come on, we're almost there! [Handsprings away] Whoop, whoop, whoop!
Finn: Hey, wait up! [Handsprings after him] Whoop, whoop!
Fern: [Continuous handspringing] Whoop, whoop whoop!
Finn and Fern: [Both] Whoop, whoop, whoop! Whoop, whoop!
Fern: [Stops in front of a cliff face.] Look, we're here!
Finn: Where? I just see a bunch of rock, swear to glob.
Fern: But check this out. [He pulls a key from his pocket.]
Finn: Whoa! Magic key!
Fern: I had to chop up a bunch of stubborn so-and-sos to get my hands on this baby. [He inserts the key into a rune engraved in the rock, and a magical entrance opens.]
Finn: Dang. You've been busy.
[They enter. Behind the rock wall is a ziggurat.]
Finn: Wow, would you look at that! They hid this ziggurat in the cliff side. Amazing!
Fern: Yeah, I poked around in there a bit, but-
Finn: Dut, dut, dut! No spoilers!
Fern: No, I know. I didn't go past the first level. I was saving it to do together.
Finn: Sweet. [They reach the top of the ziggurat, where a pole leads down into an entrance.] Whoa, what is that, a fitness pole? [He begins swinging around the pole.] Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya!
Fern: Come on. [They both slide down the pole.] This way. [Fern begins leading Finn towards a room.]
Finn: Hey, Fern, wait up. Hey, I just want to say that it's really cool that you're into this stuff. You know - that we have so much in common. It feels almost like we're real brothers, right? Or even closer.
Fern: [Is silent for a moment.] I think that's the treasure chamber down there. Why don't you go check it out? I want to study these interesting carvings. [He pretends to be interested in the carvings.] Hmm. Fascinating.
Finn: Oh. Uh, okay. I guess just holler if you need me. [He enters the chamber with a sigh.] Hey, what's this? [There are some items in the chamber.] Contemporary chair, contemporary trash, contemporary meatloaf? Hey, bad news, Fern. It looks like we've got a squatter situation here.
[Fern pulls out the key. His eyes glow menacingly again.]
Finn: I think they got the treasure, but they left some meatloaf behind. The good news is I know a meatloaf dealer-
[Fern inserts the key into a rune and a stone door slides shut, trapping Finn inside the chamber.]
Finn: What the? Fern? [He knocks on the stone door.] Fern? [He tries to push the door without success.] Uh, Fern? I think maybe the wind blew the door shut. An "act of nature", I would presume.
Fern: I'm sorry. I don't actually know how to make meatloaf. That's just a pan of dirt.
Finn: Well, that's okay. I don't know how to either! ...Fern, please open the door.
[Fern pushes out a single brick so that they can talk to each other more easily.]
Fern: This is where you live now. You'll be fine.
Finn: What?! Fern, what about Jake and BMO - my home?
Fern: It's been your home long enough. It's Fern's turn. I think I'm going to be a really great Finn. Hey, do you know who my favorite is? It's Neptr. I'm a Neptr guy! I'll be back in a month with a new bucket of trash. Later! [He replaces the brick.]
Finn: Fern!? [He tries to fly kick the door but it doesn't budge.] I've been double-crossed by grass Finn! I don't like being abandoned! I'm sensitive to it! [He groans and sits on the chair irritantly.] Mmm! [Sighs] It's too hot! [He rolls his shirt up above his belly, then begins to rummage through his backpack, groaning and muttering.] There's got to be something useful in here.
[He pulls out the red bucket from earlier and compares it to the blue bucket of trash on the floor. With a yell, he tries barging down the door again, still to no avail.]
Finn: You'll be back in a month?! With a new bucket of trash?! It's hot! There's no air in here! I need air! I need air!
[There is a whirring sound. His robotic arm has turned into a fan.]
Finn: Wha? [Examining his arm.] Oh! A microphone. There's some dried ketchup on it. [He sucks the ketchup.] Uh, hello.
[The arm beeps, and a pre-recorded hologram of Princess Bubblegum is projected from it.]
Princess Bubblegum: Hi, Finn! You're still asleep after your fight with Susan. But when you wake up, I'm sure you'll have fun discovering everything your new arm can do. And Finn, sincerely, thank you for defending our kingdom again. Oh. Someone else wants to thank you, too. [She walks out of frame and then holds up her hand, pretending it is a face. She puts on a voice.] Thank you, Finn! [Laughs, continues in normal voice] I don't know. Okay, um... Welcome, Finn!
[The video feed ends and a menu appears showing all of the arm's functions, including the fan which Finn was just using.]
Finn: Huh.
[Finn scrolls through the functions until he finds a rock drill.]
Finn: Yes!
[He scrolls some more and finds a "weed whacker". The scene changes. Fern, disguised as Finn, is walking away from the ziggurat, carrying a bunch of flowers. A buzzing is heard, and the real Finn suddenly runs at him from behind.]
Fern: Huh?
Finn: You donked up! [Tackles him.]
Fern: Aah! [Shakes off the disguise.] How did you get out? [He throws Finn off himself.]
[The two of them spar. Finn slices into Fern's back with the weed whacker.]
Fern: Hey!
[Fern headlocks Finn, but Finn manages to break it and throws him aside. Fern's eyes change for a brief moment.]
Finn: What do you think you're doing?!
Princess Bubblegum (Finn's arm): I'm weed whacking.
Fern: You've been Finn long enough! It's my turn. [He growls and leaps at Finn. Finn dodges.]
Finn: Fern, smarten up!
Fern: [With glowing eyes] Nuh-uh!
Finn: [Taken aback] What are you?
Princess Bubblegum (Finn's arm): A weed whacker.
[Fern hisses and draws his sword. He strikes at Finn, who catches the blade in the fingers of his bionic arm. They begin to duel. Finn strikes Fern and mows a chunk of his head. Fern hisses and slashes back at Finn, leaving a shallow gash in his belly.]
Finn: My belzer!
[Fern tackles Finn to the ground. He has his sword at Finn's neck, while Finn's weed whacker arm is lodged in Fern's belly without enough power to spin.]
Fern: [Laughs]
Finn: Fern, if things are going down the way I think they're going down, please tell Jake I love him.
Fern: That doesn't matter. I love him!
Finn: I know you do, Fern. Listen, we can stop this and just go home together. All this lying and fighting, it doesn't have to end like this. Today doesn't have to have this kind of... finality.
Princess Bubblegum (Finn's arm): [Mishearing him] Fatality!
[The weed whacker suddenly gets a burst of torque and fully enters into Fern's belly. Fern's face twists disturbingly as the blades spin inside him, and eventually, he bursts into a cloud of grass, which falls down onto Finn and the surrounding landscape. The scene changes back to the Tree Fort. Jake and BMO are back, and BMO is trying to break Jake's new vuvuzela. The door is heard.]
Jake: Hey, boys! Y'all have fun out there? [He turns around and sees Finn covered in scratches and grass stains, and suddenly shifts to a much more serious tone.] Wait, what happened?
[Finn opens his mouth to speak, but no words come out.]
BMO: [Happily] I know that look. You just killed someone! [Blows vuvuzela.]
[Finn breaks into tears. Jake and BMO go to comfort him. The scene goes back to the grasslands outside the ziggurat. A mysterious individual is gathering Fern's remains into a yellow bucket.]
Mysterious individual: Almost done, champ. There you go. [He picks up the bucket.] You looking for an uncle?
