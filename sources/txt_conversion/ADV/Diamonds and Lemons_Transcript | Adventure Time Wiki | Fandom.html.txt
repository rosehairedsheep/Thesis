[The episode opens at night. Finn is battling monsters with a golden sword in a Minecraft-style world.]
Finn: You sad mobs. Y'all wish you had this sweet dang bucket! [A skeleton shoots the bucket Finn is holding and he gasps before charging towards the monsters.] Yaaaah! [He slays a spider and his sword breaks.] Aah! It's mine time! [He pulls a pickaxe out of his backpack and uses it to slay a skeleton.] Get beat dead-meat! [The pickaxe also breaks while he is using it to attack a zombie.] My tool! Die! [He slays the zombie using the bucket, and it drops a carrot.] Oh, a li'l zombie carrot. [He puts the carrot in his mouth and speaks with his mouth full.] I should've washed it.
[Finn walks to a stream and collects some water in the bucket, which he places full into his backpack. A sheep splashes down a nearby waterfall and bleats. Finn towers up a cliff using dirt blocks. The sun rises behind him and monsters burn away in the distance. Finn inhales and exhales the morning air. He walks past various other animals. A cow moos and a wolf barks. Finally, he comes across Lemongrab, who is groaning in a field as he looks down at a lemon he is holding.]
Lemongrab: Impertinence. [He shakes the lemon and drops it onto the ground.] Nyah! Grow! Grooow!
[Finn arrives at the Tree House. He rides a minecart into the mine below, where Jake is digging away at the walls with a pickaxe. Jake strikes the wall and a blue glow appears.]
Jake: Aha! [He takes the diamond and places it alongside a few others in a minecart.]
Finn: [Crashing his minecart into the one containing Jake's diamonds.] Head's up! Oof.
Jake: Oof.
Finn: I got that bucket of pure river water you asked for. [He hands Jake the bucket.]
Jake: Thanks, dude.
Finn: Whatcha doing down here anyways?
Jake: Digging up diamonds for a little project.
Finn: I'll help, buddy.
[A montage shows the minecart being filled to the brim with diamonds as the two of them mine.]
Jake: Whew.
[Finn and Jake give each other a thumbs up. Jake wheels the diamonds towards a flow of lava. He takes one and polishes it with his wrist. Finn watches from nearby. Then, without warning, he throws a diamond into the lava.]
Jake: Hehe. [He begins throwing away more diamonds.] Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods!
Finn: What the heck man?! [Jake shrugs.] It's such a senseless waste.
Jake: Au contraire, mon friend. I'm extremely senseful. You see this bucket of water? It's in case I fall in the lava and catch fire.
Finn: You could make something really good with these. Like a better sword for your best bro.
Jake: Or [throws more diamonds].
Finn: [Picks up a diamond.] I'm gonna take this shiny boy, and show you the way.
Jake: You do you, buddy.
Finn: I'm sure you'd get it if you just took a moment to think about it. [He raises his voice as he takes a piston elevator back up to the surface.]
Jake: [Indifferently] Uh huh.
[The camera pans up to show Lumpy Space Princess, Ice King, Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life-Giving, Gunter, and a living block of TNT hanging out in a cave.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Look guys, it was totally epic. I wrecked the library's glass ceiling like, NBD, then I pushed a creeper down there and all the stupid smart dorks cried like tiny stupid babies.
Gunter: [Dismissively] Wenk wenk.
Live-Giving Magus: That's small potaters. We should do something big. I got a storage full of live dynamite. [He pats the life-given TNT and it barks like a dog.]
Ice King: Hey. We should grief Finn and Jake. We could plant a tree on the Tree House! Huh..?
Lumpy Space Princess: Ugh. It's totally obvious you've never griefed anybody.
Ice King: That's only technically true. And not to be "that guy", but it's actually [air quotes] "aggrieved".
Lumpy Space Princess: You better grief someone quick if you wanna stay in the Gravel Gang! Only cool mean girls allowed!
Ice King: I'm ice-cool LSP.
Lumpy Space Princess: No! Call me by my gang name!
Ice King: Okay. Gravel Gal.
[The scene changes. Finn is walking through a field. He sighs and takes out the diamond. He walks past Lemongrab again.]
Lemongrab: Hnnngh. Grooooow! [Finn hands him a shovel.] Oh. Yes, of course. [He digs a hole and drops the lemon into it with a grunt, then starts hitting it with the shovel.] Grow. No grooooowth!
[Marceline, Bubblegum, and a group of skeletons are building a windmill nearby. Marceline stretches, then laughs evilly as she summons lightning. Three new skeletons emerge from the ground.]
Marceline: Who here loves windmills? [One of the skeletons raises their hand and Marceline high fives them.] Haha, alright. Now get to work.
Finn: Yo, Marcy. That's a real nice windmill.
Marceline: Thanks. When it's done, I'm gonna grind up a whole mass of bone meal.
Skeleton: What's that, boss?
Marceline: Keep working, buddy. So, whatcha got there?
Finn: A little lump destined for something big.
Marceline: Just like your butt. Hah!
Finn: Good one. But no. I want to turn this diamond into something complex and awesome to really wow Jake.
Marceline: Well I recommend building a windmill.
Finn: A diamond windmill.
Princess Bubblegum: No, that's silly. You need something more sciencey. [Finn throws her the diamond and she takes it over to a crafting table.] Diamond, lapis, some gunpowder, juicy nugget, add the star to more gunpowder and paper - There! [She produces a firework rocket.] I'm positive Jake will appreciate it for both its fleeting sensation of beauty, and its false sense of purpose.
Finn: [Takes the firework and gestures for a high five.] Up top.
[Before Bubblegum can return the high five, Lemongrab screams from off-screen.]
Princess Bubblegum: What? Aw blocks.
[Lemongrab is repeatedly hitting the lemon with the shovel and grunting.]
Finn: He's been at it all day.
Princess Bubblegum: I should help him. See you later Finn.
Finn: Alright. M'ladies. [He bows to Marceline and Bubblegum.] M'lemon. [He bows to Lemongrab and exits.]
Lemongrab: Nyarg! [He throws away the shovel.]
Princess Bubblegum: Hey, it's okay buddy.
Lemongrab: Can't... tree!
Princess Bubblegum: You can't just hit something with a shovel and expect it to do your bidding.
Marceline: Yeah you can.
Lemongrab: What?
Princess Bubblegum: This is an oak sapling. This is a jungle sapling. [She hands him the saplings.]. And this... [She drops a lot of bone meal at his feet.] This is a lot of bone meal.
Marceline: Courtesy of Marceline the Bone Meal Queen.
Princess Bubblegum: Now we don't actually need the bone meal but it'll help speed things up, and as for the space requirements on the ground, it depends... [She is drowned out by Lemongrab screeching joyfully.]
[The scene changes. Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig are playing cards in their cabin.]
Tree Trunks: How many aces do you have?
Mr. Pig: I got five.
Tree Trunks: Oh shoot, I only got two.
[Finn pokes his head in through a window.]
Finn: Hey y'all. [He drops into the room.]
Tree Trunks: Finn!
Finn: I was just passing through, but I could sure go for one of your famous apple pies.
Tree Trunks: Say no more. [She walks to the oven, humming to herself, and removes a baking tray that resembles a crafting grid. She places onto it the ingredients for a pumpkin pie.]
Finn: I'm no expert, but that kinda looks like a pumpkin.
Tree Trunks: [Puts the ingredients in the oven.] Sorry about that. I'm just plum out of apples but I got lots of pumpkins. Too many pumpkins. [She gives Finn a pumpkin and he places it in his bag. The oven dings and Tree Trunks removes the finished pie.] Hot pie.
Finn: [Takes the pie and sniffs it deeply before putting it in his backpack.] Uh, this might sound a bit weird but I'm kinda tired and it's a long way home...
Tree Trunks: Say no more. [They both turn to Mr. Pig.]
Mr. Pig: Fine.
[Outside, Tree Trunks saddles Mr. Pig, then Finn crafts a carrot on a stick and mounts him.]
Tree Trunks: Bye bye boys.
[Mr. Pig bucks and winnies.]
Finn: Whoa!
Mr. Pig: [Reluctantly chasing the carrot on a stick.] You know you could just tell me where to go.
[Finn ignores him. The sky turns orange as the sun begins to set. Mr. Pig is getting tired and is panting. An enderman carrying a block of snow steps onto the path in front of them.]
Finn: [Whispering and turning his face away.] Dude, stop. Enderman. Don't look at it. It will-
Mr. Pig: What the heck is that?!
[The enderman turns and screeches at them, angered.]
Finn: Oh Glob.
[The enderman drops the snow block and begins teleporting towards them menacingly. They both scream and Mr. Pig bucks Finn off before running away.]
Finn: Hey!
Mr. Pig: Wee wee wee! Wee wee wee! Wee wee wee!
Finn: Enderman! Fight me! [He pulls out the pumpkin pie and realizes he doesn't have a weapon.] Oh no.
[As the enderman rushes towards him, Finn closes his eyes and looks down at the ground. This causes the enderman to stop just in front of him.]
Finn: So, uh... Do you have, like, another job, or is this what you do full time? I saw you carrying that block back there. You into building stuff?
[Peppermint Butler enters holding an emerald block, then covers his eyes and runs away after spotting the enderman.]
Finn: I bet endermen have hobbies just like everyone else.
[It begins to rain. The scene changes to show Lemongrab piling bone meal onto the saplings. It suddenly grows into a small tree.]
Lemongrab: Who-aah? Mhmm, mhmm, mhmm.
[Princess Bubblegum is sat on top of the finished windmill.]
Princess Bubblegum: Whew. Good work. Let's call it a day.
[The skeletons return to the ground and Marceline flies up to join her on the roof. She hands her an apple and they both eat. Darkness falls and the moon rises. Finn is still trapped with the enderman just in front of him. He is sweating profusely and whistling nervously. Lumpy Space Princess is sleeping in a dirt shelter nearby.]
Lumpy Space Princess: [Muttering in her sleep] Meh. Beh. Beans? Beans. [She wakes up.] That noise. [She heads over to Finn.] Finn, I'm trying to sleep!
Finn: [Whispering] Hey LSP. Don't be scared.
Lumpy Space Princess: [Speaking at regular volume] What are you even doing, just looking at this guy's toes?
Finn: Yeah, I have to.
Lumpy Space Princess: Oh. I don't get it. Does this guy even have toes? Are those his toes? I don't think I've ever even seen a toe, come to think of it. What am I even talking about?
[The enderman gets so bored of Lumpy Space Princess' rambling that they leave.]
Finn: [Suddenly hugs Lumpy Space Princess] Thank you I've been stuck here so long!
Lumpy Space Princess: [Blushing] Haha. Sure... Ew! You're all smelly and wet. Get out of here!
Finn: Fair enough. [He exits.]
Lumpy Space Princess: [Quietly] But come back after you've showered.
[Ice King flies up to Finn while he's walking and steals the pumpkin out of his bag.]
Ice King: Yoink. [Laughs maniacally.]
Finn: Thief!
Ice King: You got griefed! [He runs into the enderman with a grunt. It turns around and screeches at him. Ice King screams, places the pumpkin on his head, and runs away, pursued by the enderman. He yells in a muffled voice.] I'm not looking at you! I'm not looking!
[The sun rises the next morning. A sheep gets up from where Lemongrab has been using it as a pillow and he wakes up.]
Lemongrab: [Still half asleep] Good morning. How dare you. [With an exclamation of surprise, he notices that the tree has grown, and thinks he sees lemons growing in its leaves.] Lemon seed babies! [Clapping gleefully] Oh, you shall be my true heirs. [He knocks one of them down, revealing that it is in fact an apple.] What?! A apple? [sic] Unacceptable! UNACCEPTABLE!
[Tree Trunks enters, carrying a sword and a basket.]
Tree Trunks: Oh, gracious. [She begins knocking down apples with the sword into the basket.] Good job, Lemon-crab. [She exits.]
Lemongrab: [Quietly] Pie me. Pie me for my apples.
[The scene changes. Jake is kicking diamonds around in the mine. He sniffs the air.]
Jake: Pie.
[Finn enters and hands him the pie.]
Finn: You won't believe what I went though to get this.
Jake: Oh yeah, you were gonna make something right? [They both begin eating the pie.]
Finn: [Sees that Jake has organised the diamonds into a neat pattern.] Whoa! You did it! You took the fruits of our labor and transformed them into something beautiful and unexpected.
[Jake pushes all of the diamonds into the lava at once, destroying the pattern.]
Finn: D'aw come on! Diamonds are so hard to get! [Jake shrugs.] Oh, duh. Beauty is in the hard work itself and the oftentimes false sense of purpose we feel when doing it. It's a fleeting sensation that drives us to repeat our actions in order to capture it again. [He lights the firework rocket and it explodes anticlimactically on the ceiling of the mine. A flow of lava falls from where it exploded.] That was supposed to be fireworks.
Jake: I like this better.
[During the credits sequence, a montage is shown. Marceline and Princess Bubblegum high five having completed the windmill. Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig are left with an excess of pumpkin pies. Lemongrab chops down the apple tree. Ice King builds a dirt shelter while zombies surround him. The enderman places the pumpkin on top of the snow blocks they were carrying earlier, creating a snow golem. The enderman and the snow golem hold hands.]
