[Open on Boscha in her bedroom, which is filled with various trophies. She looks into her mirror with her hair down.]
Boscha: You are talented. You are a star. [pulls her hair up into a bun] You may be hated, so long as you are feared. [stands, puts on a captain's varsity jacket] Most important of all, you are a winner. 
[Boscha rips off a page of her calendar before walking out the door, revealing the whole month has been marked “Grudgby Season”. Cut to Boscha walking through Bonesborough dribbling a grudgby ball, passing several mesmerized onlookers.] 
Old Woman: There she goes, captain of the Banshees. Off to win another championship for Hexside.
Mother: [to her child] Why can’t you be more like her?
Child: [breathes in deeply with an annoyed expression]
[Boscha approaches Hexside, with a banner reading “Go get ‘em, Banshees” magically unfurling over the school. Skara, Amelia, and Cat form up behind Boscha.]
Boscha: Alright, girls. You know the drill. Captain goes first. [enters the school] Hello, Hexside! Your star has arrived. Groveling line starts here. [looks around] Something’s not right. Nobody’s here!
[A streamer falls.]
Students: [laughing]
[Boscha peers around a corner, spotting a crowd of students gathered around Willow, who is holding a potted plant.]
Hexside Student: No way!
Potions Student: Do me next. Do me! 
[Willow uses her magic, the plant sprouting a fruit looking like the potions student’s face. The student takes it.]
Potions Student: Welcome to the world, little buddy. You’re the coolest, Willow.
Willow: Aw, shucks!
Oracle Student: Yeah, Willow rules!
Boscha: [walking past with her posse] Wow, she has to make friends out of plants. How sad.
[Willow looks downcast.]
Amity: [entering] Oh, please!
[Willow perks back up. Amity walks up to Boscha.]
Amity: You know, I used to be like you, Boscha, obsessed with status, challenging my competition. But I grew up. When will you?
[Amity continues walking. Boscha and her friends stop. The crowd of students laughs.]
Boscha: Oh, this is not gonna fly.
[THEME]
[Cut to outside of Hexisde. Eda and Luz fly in on Eda's staff.] 
Luz: My first Grudgby season! I’m so excited, I have more school spirit than the school spirits!
[Camera pans to a ghost holding pom poms.]
Ghost: Why do I even bother? [groans and floats away]
Eda: Ah, Grudgby season is the best. You know, I used to play, back in my gory days.
Luz: You mean “glory days”?
Eda: Well, that too. I was unstoppable on the field. I had the best moves and the best cheats.
Luz: Cheating isn’t anything to brag about. How do you know you were any good if all you did was cheat your way to victory?
Eda: Ugh. What do humans know, with your goody-goody attitude? If “cheaters never prosper,” why was I the star player?
Luz: Well, can’t reason with crazy. [pulls a sleeping King out of her hood] Bye King, you little snoozers. 
[Luz kisses King's head and puts him on the staff as he wakes up. Luz waves and leaves. King scurries into Eda's hair.]
King: Ugh. Eda, when was the last time you cleaned up in here? [throws a bag of onion rings, holds a rat by its tail] Get your own scalp, buddy. This one’s taken. [throws rat]
Eda: All this talk of Grudgby has me feeling nostalgic. Whaddya say you and me take a little trip down memory lane?
King: Hard pass.
Eda: That’s the spirit.
Ghost: You mean me?
Eda: Ugh. Come on! [flies away]
Ghost: Oh.
[Cut to a history classroom within Hexside.]
Teacher: Over 50 years ago, Emperor Belos appointed a head witch to each coven. [continues talking]
Luz: [to Gus and Willow] I can’t wait for Grudgby season to start! I’ve studied up on all sorts of magical sports. Like this. [holds up a DVD box] “Good Witch Azura 2: The Field of Deadly Fates”. A classic underdog tale.
Willow: [taking the DVD box] Azura challenges Hecate in the smibbitch championship. But will she risk it all by taking a chance on the deadly Thorn Vault? [opens box] 
Gus: [grabbing the DVD] Ooh, a shiny cookie. [tries to eat it]
Luz: [grabbing the DVD from Gus] Not food.
Teacher: The council headquarters was built and paid for by...? Anyone? Willow?
Willow: [stands up] Uh, the Pixie Dust Taxes?
Oracle Student: [from the hall] Whoo, yeah! Go, Willow!
Teacher: [spells door closed] Impressive, Miss Park.
[The students murmur in admiration.]
Luz: What’s going on? It’s like all of Hexside’s caught Willow fever!
Willow: Ever since I patched thing up with Amity, I’ve been feeling more confident. [gesturing to the flower shaped hair clip she's wearing] I guess it shows.
[The hair clip levitates off of Willow's head and into Boscha’s hand.] 
Boscha: Aw, Willow thinks she’s popular now. How cute.
[Willow blushes in embarrassment as Luz and Gus look at her. Luz glares at Boscha.]
Luz: Hey, I agree, my friend is very cute. But give that back! 
[Luz grabs for the hair clip. Boscha pulls her hand back.]
Boscha: It’s weird that Amity hangs out with you now. Ever since Grom, she’s gone soft. But don’t worry. [puts clip in her hair] I’m still here to show you who’s boss.
Gus: [grabs the hair clip] Here Willow. 
[Gus puts the clip back in Willow's hair. She sits up straighter.]
Boscha: Oh-ho-ho! The friends wanna get in on this too, huh? 
[Boscha levitates Willow’s bag into the air, spilling its contents onto Gus, Luz, and Willow. 
Boscha: [laughs]
Teacher: Is that laughter? Hey, hey! Learning’s not supposed to be fun!
Luz: We are having zero fun, I swear. Boscha’s picking on us.
Boscha: My apologies, sir. I was practicing my aim for Grudgby. [throws an eraser at Willow]
Teacher: Boscha, how could you throw things at them... [draws a circle on his chest] when you could throw things at me? Am I over here? Or am I over here? Anything for the captain of the Banshees! 
Boscha: Oh, thanks, [takes gum out] but I already have the perfect targets. [throws gum into Willow’s hair]
Willow: Oh! [groans]
Luz: Don’t worry, it’s not like she can follow us around all day, right?
[Cut to Hexside’s front steps. Gus, Luz, and Willow are covered in trash, their faces graffitied with insults.]
Luz: She followed us around all day. She literally followed us around all day! [shakes Willow]
Willow: [sighs] I’m really sorry I pulled you guys into this. We should have just kept a low profile. Boscha could get away with murder if she wanted to. 
Principal Bump: [going down the stairs] What’s this? Boscha got away with murder? I can’t say I approve, but at least she’s trying new things. [leaves]
Luz: We will find a way out of this. 
[Amity passes by the stairs.]
Luz: [gasps] Amity! 
[Luz cleans herself off. Amity turns around, blushing slightly, as Luz runs up to her.]
Amity: Oh, Luz! You’re here! I mean, obviously you’re here, this is school, and you go here now, with, uh, me... [pause] I’ve been talking for too long. 
Luz: Amity, we need your help.
Amity: Yes, I can help! With what, exactly?
Luz: Boscha won’t stop picking on Willow, and no one will do anything about it because she’s the “Star Captain of the Grudgby Team.” [slumps]
Amity: Yeah, this time of year, she’s extra unbearable. 
Luz: [clasps hands together] You’re friends with her, can you help us? 
Amity: [backs up] Uh, the hard part is, there’s no reasoning with Boscha. She only speaks in Grudgby terms. 
Luz: Hmm. Okay, okay. I’m pickin' up what you’re puttin' down. 
Amity: [looks at the books she's holding] I’m... not putting anything down. 
Willow: [screams]
[Trash falls on Willow from above as other students watch. Luz runs up to her.
Luz: Willow! What happened? 
[Gus helps take the trash off of Willow.]
Willow: Boscha happened.
Boscha: [from a second floor window, a trash can upside down in her hands] Hey Willow! I just thought all trash should stay in one spot. 
Luz: That’s it! Boscha! Willow challenges you to...
[Boscha raises an eyebrow.]
Luz: ...a Grudgby match! 
Boscha: [drops the trash can] She what? 
Willow: I what?
[The trash can falls onto Gus.]
Gus: [from inside the trash can] She what? Seriously, what’s going on here? 
[Cut to the Owl House. Eda is in her old Grudgby jacket, showing a photo album to King.]
Eda: And here’s when we took down Epiderm High in the semi-finals. [points to photo of her younger self holding a trophy] Oh, I was the youngest on the team, but I had what some call “star power”. AKA, this. [pulls a box out from her hair labeled “Eda’s Rad Cheats”] This is my cheat box. I have all my best weapons in here. Smoke bombs, sock-worms... Mwah. You name it. Oh, I never lost a game with this bad boy. 
[The door slams open. Hooty enters.]
Hooty: Hoot-hoot! Guess who found a special friend in the forest. [brings in Lilith, wrapped up in his elongated body] It was me. Hoot! 
[Hooty releases Lilith, who falls to the floor.]
Eda: Lilith. 
Lilith: Edalyn.
Hooty: [pops up between them] Hooty!
Eda: Ugh. Scram, Hooty.
Hooty: Okay!
[Hooty's body retracts back into the front door, which then promptly slams shut.]
Lilith: Why are you in your old uniform? 
Eda: No reason. It’s laundry day. What are you doing here?
Lilith: [summons scroll, clears throat, reads] Edalyn Clawthorne, you are hereby under arrest by the order of the Emperor of the Boiling Isles- 
[Eda shares a look with King. She uses her magic to roll up the scroll, which smacks Lilith in the face.]
Lilith: Ah!
Eda: You were saying? 
Lilith: Come on! [stomps foot] I have to bring you in. It’s time for you to join the coven. The Emperor has big plans for the Isles, and he wants you to be a part of it all.
Eda: [picks up photo album; sarcastically] Ooh, Aah. What an incredible opportunity for me. 
Lilith: What are you even looking at? [grabs the photo album from Eda] Grudgby pictures? Feeling sentimental?
Eda: Pah! Me? Never. I was just telling King here how good I was. [summons Grudgby ball]
Lilith: Oh, Edalyn. Not only is the curse affecting your hair, but your memory as well. 
[Lilith holds up the picture of young Eda, unfolding it to reveal a young Lilith with an even larger grudgby trophy, and several medals.]
Eda: [groans, looks at Grudgby ball] Ah, tell you what. I’ll go with you peacefully to the Emperor...
Lilith: Really?
Eda: Sure. If you beat me at a game of Grudgby. Luz is always challenging people to things. Why not me?
[Lilith looks at Eda for a second before grinning and approaching her.]
Lilith: Hmm... Game on. 
[Cut back to Hexside. Boscha turns away from the window.]
Willow: Luz, what are you doing? 
Luz: I’m just following Amity’s advice. Boscha only speaks in Grudgby terms. Trust me, I have a plan. 
[Luz walks up to Boscha, who is spinning a Grudgby ball.]
Boscha: Okay, maybe it’s the altitude of the second floor, but I thought I heard you say that Leaf Girl wanted to challenge me to a Grudgby match.
Luz: That’s right! We’ll settle this once and for all on the field.
[Students flank both of them. Willow runs up between them.]
Willow: Or we could just talk about our issues.
Boscha: Let’s do this.
Willow: Oh, no. 
Luz: [hugs Willow with one arm] If Willow’s team wins, you don’t get to pick on her anymore. [gestures to Gus in the trashcan behind her]
Boscha: Fine! And when we win, Willow and your team will be our water gofers.
Luz: Ha! That’s not even a punishment. I love water. 
Boscha: And we get to use you as target practice. 
[Boscha throws the ball and kicks it, sending it straight through a tree trunk. The hole smokes.]
Boscha: See you after school, losers. 
[The Banshees leave. The entire tree catches on fire.]
Oracle Student: Whoo-hoo! Willow verses Boscha!
[Gus, Luz, Willow, and Amity return to the front steps. Luz takes the trash can off of Gus.]
Amity: Luz, this isn’t a good idea.
Willow: Yeah, I’ve never even played Grudgby before! How am I supposed to beat Boscha? 
Luz: But you’re the better witch. [tosses trash can, pulls out Azura DVD] I don’t know much about sports, but I know about sports movies. [hops up the staircase] We, too, are a ragtag team of lovable misfits joined together to defeat a powerful enemy. With a little team spirit and a training montage, we can win. 
Willow: Well, if you think this’ll work, then I’m in. How about you, Gus?
Gus: In seasons past, [holds up a pair of flags] these flags have waved in support of Grudgby greats. Now they will wave for the greatest: Me! [waves flags]
Luz: What about you, Amity? 
Amity: Me? On a team with you? Running around in cute uniforms? Sweating? [Amity blushes heavily, then runs off] I gotta go!
Luz: Huh? Well, I guess she’s out. In any case, [hops off the stairs] let’s get training! 
[Cut to Luz, Willow, and Gus at the Hexside Grudgby field.]
Luz: So, how exactly do we play Grudgby? 
Gus: Well, [summons an illusion of the field] there’s a ball, and you score by getting the ball through the other team’s goal.
[The little player on his field throws a ball through a goal post. They jump in triumph, fireworks going off behind them, a sign reading "WINNER" rising from the ground. It disappears in a puff of blue smoke.]
Luz: That sounds easy.
Willow: It is, except...
[Willow summons a leaf and blows it onto the field. The leaf is quickly ripped to shreds by fire, vines, ice shards, and rock spikes that emerge from the field.]
Luz: Oh, right. Boiling Isles. Should have predicted this. 
[Luz sets her phone to play motivational sports music. She puts a sweatband on.]
Luz: Alright! Every great sports story includes a training montage. 
Gus: [raises hand] What’s a “mon-tage”?
Luz: Well…
[Montage of Luz explaining to Willow and Gus what a montage is: Luz lectures in front of a chalkboard with the word "MONTAGE" written on it. Gus takes notes; Luz leans against a TV playing a football movie; the three of them having a tea party in animal onesies. Cut back to the Grudgby field.]
Gus: Oh, I get it now. Wait, were we just having a tea party in animal jammies?
Luz: What happens in the montage stays in the montage! Now let’s hit the field.
[Luz blows a whistle, throwing a Grudgby ball at Gus and Willow. It hits the ground. Willow prepares to kick it, but a giant tentacle burst from the ground, throwing the ball. Willow catches it.]
Willow & Gus: [yell] 
[They both run away seconds before the tentacle would have hit them. A giant hand bursts from the ground in front of them. They try to reverse direction. Willow runs off but Gus is caught. Flaming Grudgby balls follow Willow.]
Oracle Student: [from the bleachers] Woo! Go Willow! 
[Willow runs the opposite direction. A trampoline emerges from the ground and launches her backwards.]
Oracle Student: You’ll get ‘em next time!
[Willow lands next to Luz, who hasn't moved at all.]
Willow: [sigh] I need a cup of water.
[Gus walks up to them and falls on the ground.]
Luz: Now for our big finale! Let’s try... [claps, activating a plant glyph] the Thorn Vault. [puts glyph on ground]
Willow: Luz, wait-
[Willow and Gus are launched into the air by a column of thorns. Willow summons a large plant to break their fall. Gus rolls right off of it.]
Gus: [groans]
Willow: Gus! Talk to me Gus! 
[Luz runs up to them.]
Gus: I, I think something’s broken. [pulls out his flags, now snapped, and gasps] My flags! I never should have tried to play. You were always enough for me. [sobs]
[Willow looks down to see her hair clip, now snapped in half.]
Willow: Come on, Gus. I have some floral tape in the greenhouse. We’ll fix them.
Gus: [sniffs] Okay.
[Willow and Gus stand and begin walking away.]
Luz: Guys, let’s try the Thorn Vault one more time. 
Willow: Not now, Luz. We’re tired.
Luz: But we’re the underdogs, we have to stay upbeat and keep trying and--
Willow: [walking up to Luz] Luz! Not everything can be solved with a good attitude and a dope music soundtrack. We’re going to lose. And no movie can help us against that. The game is off. [leaves]
Luz: Willow, wait! 
[Luz looks down at the broken hair clip. She picks it up, watching Willow walk off the field.]
[Cut to outside the Owl House, with a makeshift Grudgby field set up in front of it. Eda and Lilith approach each other from opposite sides. Hooty stretches out to be between them, now wearing a ref's hat and whistle.]
Hooty: You gals ready to hoot? We want a clean game here, so no magic allowed. 
King: [next to a scoreboard, dressed as a cheerleader] Yes! Now I’ll strike fear into my enemies with this armor of intimidation.
Eda: [laughs, snorts] Yeah, intimidation armor. [to Lilith] Pushing paper all day might make you a little rusty. I’ll try to go easy on you. [tosses the ball]
Lilith: [catches ball with her knee] Remember, dear sister, you may have been star player, but I was team captain for a reason. [throws it back]
Eda: [grunts]
[Hooty blows the whistle.]
[Cut back to the Hexside Grudgby field, Luz sitting on the bleachers. She repairs Willow’s hair clip with a band-aid. Amity walks up to her.]
Amity: Tough practice? [sits down next to Luz]
Luz: I pushed Willow and Gus too hard. It’s just, I hate seeing Willow get picked on. She’s one of the best friends I’ve ever had. Winning this game is the only way I know how to help. 
Amity: Did you know, before Boscha, I was the Grudgby team captain? 
Luz: Really?
Amity: Well, once I left the team, I decided that was a part of my life I wanted to forget. 
[Fade to a flashback of Amity as captain of the Banshees.]
Amity: [voiceover] We were playing Glandus High for the Island Championship. We had a move planned, and it was a good one. But, at the last minute, I decided I wanted to do something a bit flashier. I changed our game plan to... the Thorn Vault.
Luz: Good Witch Azura 2: Field of Deadly Fates! You watched it too?
Amity: Uh, yeah.
[In the flashback, Amity successfully does the Thorn Vault, launching herself to a goal post and tossing the ball in. The score changes for a Banshee win with no time to spare. Amity cheers, then realizes she hurt her teammates.]
Amity: It went disastrously wrong. My teammates got hurt. All because I had an idea of how things should be. I pushed them too far.
[Fade back to Amity in the present.]
Amity: I never played again after that day. 
[Amity turns to Luz, their faces incredibly close. Amity stumbles back and falls, blushing heavily.]
Luz: Ah! Sorry. [helps Amity up] I just really love backstories.
[The Banshees enter, walking onto the field.]
Luz: [puts something in Amity’s hand] I know what to do to make this up to Willow. Thanks. [leaves]
[Amity looks at her hand, revealing Willow’s hair clip. Amity looks out on the field as Luz approaches Boscha.]
Boscha: It’s after school. Where’s the leader of your loser brigade? 
Luz: I’m here on her behalf. We forfeit.
Amity: [gasps]
[Amelia, Cat, and Skara are surprised.]
Luz: And I’m here to tell you that I’ll take Willow’s place as your water gofer, target practice, whatever you need. 
Boscha: Wow, you’re really a good friend. [magically lights a Grudgby ball on fire] And a perfect target. 
Luz: [gasps]
Boscha: [throws ball at Luz] Think fast!
[Luz ducks. The ball hits the base of a tree, which falls over. Boscha summons more flaming Grudgby balls while the Banshees watch in horror. Luz runs as the balls are sent at her. Amity runs off.]
[Cut to the school greenhouse. Willow tapes up Gus’ flags, which are hooked up to a saline bag and a heart monitor.]
Willow: There, that ought to do it. 
Gus: These are flags of surrender now.
Amity: [slams open the door] Luz needs our help!
[Willow and Gus share a look.]
Amity: I know she pushed you guys, and she always gets in over her head. She can be so stupid, which I love-- I mean hate! In any case, she needs you right now, which is sweet-- I mean, I hate it, and it’s dumb!
[Willow and Gus stare at Amity, Willow looking greatly suspicious.]
Gus: You lost me.
Amity: Just, here. 
[Amity gives Willow her hair clip. Willow smiles.]
Gus: Can we resist the call to action? No! May the flags be raised once more.
[Gus runs out, Willow and Amity right behind him.]
[Cut back to Eda & Lilith’s grudgby match. Eda tries scoring a goal, but Hooty blocks the ball.]
Hooty: Hoot!
Eda: Hooty! Whose side are you on?
Hooty: I’m an unbiased participant, hoot-hoot.
[Lilith grabs the ball, successfully avoids Eda and Hooty and scores a goal. King marks the score, now tied 5-5.]
King: Point goes to Lilith. We’re at a tie here, folks.
[Eda and Lilith both pant in exhaustion.]
Hooty: Time for one more play. 
Eda: [pulls our her cheat box] Just one little trick and the game will be mine. 
[Eda opens her cheat box, only to find it empty, save for a note reading, “I noticed your lunchbox was getting dirty so I cleaned it! LOVE, LUZ”, with a drawing of a heart and Luz throwing a peace sign.]
Eda: Dang it, Luz! Your nonsense has gotten into my head. Well, time to do this the old-fashioned way. [shoves box back in her hair]
Lilith: Taking your time. Nervous?
Eda: Not today, sister.
[Hooty blows the whistle, beginning play again. Eda and Lilith both jump for the ball. Eda grabs it and makes for the goal. Hooty emerges from the ground.]
Hooty: It’s me again! 
[Eda steps on his face.]
Hooty: Ow! 
[Lilith leans on his face.]
Hooty: Oh geez, hey!
Lilith: No!
Eda: Yeah!
[Eda scores the goal.]
King: Ha ha! Game over! Team Owl House rules supreme!
Eda: Yes! Still got it! Still got the skills to pay the bills!
Lilith: No! [on her knees, slamming her fists angrily at the ground] No! I can’t go back to the Emperor empty-handed.
Eda: [sighs]
[Eda takes her ring off. She holds it out to Lilit.]
Eda: Here. Tell them I put up a heck of a struggle. 
Lilith: [takes the ring] I will be back for you. And next time, I won’t be alone. 
Eda: I’ll be waiting.
[Lilith looks over her shoulder at Eda, then walks into the distance.]
Hooty: I’ll be waiting too! Hoot-hooty-hoot!
[Cut back to the Hexside grudgby field. Luz is running from Boscha’s Grudgby balls. She stops when a wall of spikes rises before her.]
Boscha: Having fun yet? ‘Cause I’m just getting warmed up.
[Boscha throws a flaming grudgby ball at Luz, which is sent back by a tree suddenly emerging from the field in front of Luz.]
Boscha: Huh?
Willow: Boscha. Your issue is with me, not Luz. Leave her be. 
Luz: Willow! [runs up to her] Willow, I’m sorry I got you into this mess. You’re right, I got my head too stuck in the movie biz.
Willow: It’s okay. I know you were just trying help in your Luz way. But now let’s finish this... my way. [turns to Boscha] The game is back on.
Boscha: You need three players on your team. Where’s your third?
[Willow and Luz look to Gus in the bleachers, looking sadly at his flags.]
Willow: Uh, well…
Amity: Right here. 
Boscha: You just destroyed your social life.
Amity: [looks at Willow and Luz] Nah. [looks at Boscha] I think I made it better. 
Boscha: Ugh! Game on!
[Boscha stalks off. Amity, Luz, and Willow smile at each other. Cut to Boscha, Cat, and Amelia facing off against them, all six in Grudgby gear.]
Gus: Go Willow!
Willow: [to Boscha] There’s something on your shoe.
Boscha: [scoffs] Like I’d fall for that. 
[The ball is launched into the air. Boscha lunges for it but is stopped.]
Bosha: Huh?
[There are vines wrapped around her shoe. She falls over.]
Boscha: Oh!
[Willow catches the ball and conjures a plant that eats her. The plant pops up next to a goal post, spitting Willow back out. Willow makes the first goal.
[The game progresses. Amity uses a giant abomination arm to hold back an axe for Luz, who scores another goal. Gus creates illusion duplicates of himself to cheer Luz, Amity, and Willow on. Amelia scores a goal for the Banshees]
Luz: Nice work.
Amelia: Thanks.
[The two high-five.]
Boscha: [annoyed] Hmm.
[Amelia glares at Luz. Luz is confused.]
[The game progresses further, score now 6-5 Banshees. Boscha throws a flaming grudgby ball at Luz, who blocks with an ice glyph. Luz catches the ball, seeing a fire glyph burned onto it.]
Luz: Whoa. 
[Luz puts a piece of paper onto the ball, burning the glyph onto the paper. She taps it, activating a fire spell.]
Luz: [gasps] Fire magic! [throws ball] Amity!
[The Banshees gasp and run away from the flaming ball. Amity knocks it into the goal with a giant abomination fist.]
Amity: Yeah! [laughs happily]
[The score is now tied 9-9 with thirty seconds left. Both teams huddle up, Banshees just standing, Underdogs with their arms around each other.]
Amity: There’s time for one more play.
Willow: And this play could determine whether us underdogs win or lose. 
Luz: Here’s what I have to offer. [fans holds out fire, light, plant, and ice glyphs]
Willow: I think we should try... [points to plant glyph] this one. 
Luz: [gasps] The Thorn Vault? Are you sure? 
Willow: I’m ready this time. 
[Gus and his illusions cheer on as play resumes. The two teams face off at centerfield once again. The ball is launched into the air, and Luz catches it.]
Luz: Ha!
Amity: Watch out! 
[Amity pushes Luz out of the way of Boscha, getting tackled as a result.]
Luz: Amity!
Amity: Luz! 
[Luz runs from Cat and Amelia. She takes out a plant glyph and puts it on the ground, then holds out the ball for Willow. Willow runs and jumps, taking the ball and landing on the plant glyph. She runs across the Thorn Vault as it grows, then jumps off the end, throwing the ball through the goal. She hangs off the goalpost until the timer goes off, then summons a bush to break her fall.]
Luz: Whoo! [hugs Willow] You did it, Willow! We did it! We Won! 
[Luz and Willow look to the score board, reading 9-10. Then the Banshees’ score changes to 999.]
Luz: Wait, what?
[Boscha holds up a golden insect.]
Willow: Oh, thorns.
Luz: Wh- What happened?
Willow: She caught the Rusty Smidge.
Luz: The what?
Boscha: Yeah, while you were celebrating your “victory,” I caught this guy. It means we automatically win. All magic sports are like this. 
Luz: That just invalidates all our efforts! If catching that thing is so important, why do anything else? There’s no reason to watch any of the other players! That’s such a stupid rule!
Boscha: Well, we beat them and proved our social dominance. All is right in the hierarchy. 
[Skara, Cat, and Amelia run up to Willow and Luz.]
Boscha: Hey!
Skara: Good game, Willow! 
Amelia: I had so much fun playing you guys.
Willow: Oh, really?
Cat: Willow, you’re really good. Would you want to be on our team? 
[Willow looks at Boscha, who seems terrified.]
Willow: Mm, thanks for the offer, but I think I’m done with Grudgby for a while. Hey, where’s...
[Amity groans, trying to stand up.]
Luz & Willow: Amity! [runs up to her]
Amity: I think-- I think I hurt my leg. But, I’ll be okay. 
Luz: Are you sure? I could help carry you if it really hurts.
Amity: [blushing and chuckling nervously] I’m fine! Who’s Amity?
Luz: Aaaaand, scoop! [picks Amity up]
Amity: [chuckling nervously] Oh, wow. Sports. 
Gus: Can we have another montage? 
Luz: Yeah! Montage, activate! 
[Montage: Gus, Luz, and Willow all scoring goals, then lounging in huge flowers with spring-like stems; Gus uses his illusion magic to change Willow’s team’s score of 10 to 1000; the three run up to the Owl House, all stepping on Hooty's face; King dancing in his cheerleading outfit while Luz records it on her phone.]
King: [chuckles] You’re- You’re not gonna show this to anyone, right?
Eda: Of course not. Keep cheering.
Luz: [chuckles]
[The montage ends with the front door opening, letting in Amity, whose foot is now in a cast. She waves at Luz, Willow, Gus, and King. Hooty carries Amity over to the couch. Luz offers her a cup of tea, which she takes, blushing. Eda enters, holding her own cup of tea. Everyone is smiling and at peace, in a place they belong.]
