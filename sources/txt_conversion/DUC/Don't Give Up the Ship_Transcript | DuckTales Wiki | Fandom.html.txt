[We open the series at the top of a hill with a sign pointing to the city of Duckburg. Two birds that are sitting on the sign fly off of it as the camera pans over to reveal Duckburg itself. The camera then starts to zoom in on the tall building on Killmotor Hill - the Money Bin of Scrooge McDuck, as we hear him singing...]
Scrooge: Scrooge McDuck, he had a vault, E-I-E-I-O. And in this vault, he had some dough, E-I-E-I-O.
[He chuckles as we fade to an interior view of the Bin, where Scrooge has stored has stored all five multipujillion, five impossibidillion, seven fantasticatrillion dollars and sixteen cents of his money. Scrooge is standing at the vault's entrance, in his swimsuit.]
Scrooge: Ah, there's only one thing better than owning a vault full of cold-hard cash, and that's swimming in it! [dives into his money as though it were water and proceeds to do so] I love to dive around in it like a porpoise, and burrow through it like a gopher... [does so] ...and toss it up and let it hit me on the head.
[He proceeds to do just that, but then hears a beeping sound on his person. He reaches in to his swimsuit and pulls out a wristwatch.]
Scrooge: Curse me kilts, I'm late!
[Scrooge dives under his cash, then surfaces right next to the ladder leading out of the vault, now suddenly dressed in his familiar blue coat and top hat. He climbs up and is about to head out of the vault, but then stops and goes back to the edge, pushing at his head to knock a coin out of his non-existent ear. One screen-wipe later, we see Scrooge walking down the streets of Duckburg, passing by a charity worker.]
Charity worker: Penny for the poor?
Scrooge: They're not worth it! [continues on, passing by a cheese shop]
Cheese shop worker: Would you care for a sample, Mr. McDuck?
Scrooge: No!
Cheese shop worker: They're free-eeee.
Scrooge: [walks back to her] Can I have more than one?
Cheese shop worker: Of course, take as many as you--
Scrooge: [scoops all the cheese cube samples into his hat and then walks off] Be back tomorrow! [looking at the clock tower] Ach, I'll never make it unless I... eugh, spend money on a taxi. Eugh. Taxi!
[As he waits for a cab to show up, Scrooge checks for spare change in a nearby phone booth.]
[Cut to Duckburg Pier, where we see a whistle go off. The camera pans over to Donald Duck, now enlisted in the Navy, saying goodbye to his nephews.]
Donald: Now while I'm in the Navy, boys, you mind your Uncle Scrooge.
Huey: But he's so cheap!
Donald: Yeah, but he's family. Okay, Huey?
Huey: Yes, Unca Donald.
Donald: No back-talk, Dewey.
Dewey: No, Unca Donald.
Donald: Louie, be good. And no spitballs.
Louie: Uh, yes and no, Unca Donald.
Donald: Oh, and one more thing. Gimmie a hug!
[The nephews do so.]
Huey: Oh, we're really gonna miss ya, Unca Donald!
Donald: Aw. And I'm gonna miss you too.
[The group hears the taxi cab that Scrooge took driving up. The nephews look apprehensive.]
Huey: There's the ol' skinflint now!
Scrooge: [to the cab driver] There's yer two dollars, ya mercenary!
Cab driver: Hey, what about my tip?!
Scrooge: [takes three of the cheese cube samples out of his hat and tosses them to the driver] Here, chew on this! [approaching his nephew] Donald, you can't be serious about this crazy idea. There's no profit in it!
Donald:  But I've already enlisted, Uncle Scrooge. I wanna see the world!
Scrooge:  So I'll buy you a globe.
Navy officer: [calling from offscreen] Hey! Move it, Seaman Duck!
Donald: [shaking his uncle's hand] I gotta go. Take care of my nephews.
[Donald grabs his duffel bag and prepares to toss it on to the boat that's taking him onto the Navy carrier he'll be serving on. However, he throws too hard and ends up being tossed onto the boat with it.]
Donald: Whoaoh!
Scrooge: But what have I done to deserve being saddled with these... eh, juveniles?
Donald: [waving from the boat, on which he and his duffel bag have landed on the Navy officer] You're the only one I trust, Uncle Scrooge!
Scrooge: Lucky me.
Nephews: Lucky us.
Scrooge: Eeh. Well, I guess we should head for home.
Louie: All right. I'll get a taxi.
Scrooge: [stopping Louie with his cane] Ah, no need for that. It's only a brisk, three-mile walk. And after that, we'll have a nutritious lunch of cheese!
[The nephews look at each and shrug, then grab their bags.]
[Fade to later. Scrooge and the nephews are right outside McDuck Manor.]
Scrooge: Well, here we are! Home sweet home.
[Scrooge walks up to his front door and knocks on it with his cane. The butler, Duckworth, comes to answer.]
Scrooge: Ah, Duckworth. Carry the suitcases up to the room we've prepared.
Duckworth: Of course, sir.
Huey: Wow! A palace!
Dewey: And a butler!
Louie: And our own room! Y'know, livin' here might not be so bad after all.
[His brothers nod in agreement.]
[Three days later, we see that the nephews are living in the attic, now thinking it is that bad.]
Huey: This is the pits.
Louie: Correction - the mega pits! Three boring days!
Dewey: We haven't been allowed to do a single thing in this whole house!
Huey: [looking out the window] 75 rooms in the place and he sticks us in the attic!
[Duckworth enters, carrying a silver platter]
Duckworth: Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Dewey: Hey Duckworth, where's Unca Scrooge?
Louie: We haven't seen him for days!
Duckworth: Oh, he's a very busy man, Master, uh...
Dewey: Dewey.
Duckworth: Of course. As you know, Mr. McDuck put me in charge of you.
Huey: Well, whoop-dee-do.
Duckworth: Exactly. I have something for you.
Louie: If those are more cheese samples, we're gonna riot!
Duckworth: Pray, do not get your knickers in a proverbial twist. It's simply a letter from your Uncle Donald. [lifts up the cover to reveal that is indeed that]
Nephews: [grab the letter and start fighting over who gets to open it] Let me have it!/Open it!/What does it say? Where is he?
Duckworth: I'm surprised the urchins know how to read.
[Fade to a minute later. The nephews have now stopped fighting over the letter, and Huey is reading it.]
Huey: "Dear boys, The Navy sure is exciting!"
[As Huey reads, we fade to a first-person view of someone flying a Navy jet, coming in for a landing on the carrier. However, Donald is not the one flying this jet; he's actually washing the nearby tower.]
Huey: [voice-over] "And things are really looking up for me!"
[Donald turns his head to watch the jet that just landed, forgetting what he's doing. He ends up dropping the wash bucket on his commanding officer, Admiral Grimitz, who does not look very amused about this.]
Huey: [voice-over] "In fact, Admiral Grimitz has taken a personal interest in me, and has assigned me to do some jet-fighter work."
[As Huey reads this, we see that what Donald really means is that he's simply mopping the floor near the jet. He briefly stops to take a closer look at the jet, only to get a face full of fire. He stumbles away from it as we fade back to the nephews reading his letter.]
Huey: "I hope you are all well. I will write again soon. Love, Unca Donald."
Dewey: Wow! An aircraft carrier!
Louie: And fighter jets!
[The nephews scurry downstairs out of the attic...]
[...and into Scrooge's living room. Louie is pushing Dewey around on a cart, making plane noises, while Huey stands on the table, imitating a landing signal man.]
Huey: Duck leader, clear to land! [Dewey flashes a thumbs-up] No, veer off! You're coming in too fast! [jumps off the table]
[Louie crashes the cart against the table, sending Dewey sailing across the table and knocking the artifacts Scrooge had sitting on it. Scrooge is looking over some papers nearby when he hears the crash.]
Scrooge: Oh, it must be those nephews. I don't want to get involved. [gets out of his chair and grabs his hat] Ach, I'm going to the office where I can work in peace!
[Cut to Huey, pulling at some window curtains.]
Huey: I know what we need - landing cables! [notices Scrooge walking by outside the window] Hey, there goes Unca Scrooge!
Louie: Now's our chance to talk to him!
[The nephews head for the front door, but Duckworth is guarding it.]
Duckworth: I'm sorry, gentlemen, but Mr. McDuck left strict orders.
[The nephews look cunningly at each other, knowing what to do in this situation.]
[Fade to later. Scrooge is arriving at the Money Bin, unaware that the nephews are now right behind him. He walks in and comes upon one of his employees, reading the newspaper and whistling.]
Scrooge: You! There'll be no whistlin' while you work!
Employee: But-but-but Mr. McDuck! I wasn't working, I-I mean--
Scrooge: [suddenly feels Huey pulling at his sleeve] Whaaat?
Huey: Aw, lighten up, Unca Scrooge.
Scrooge:  What are you doing here?
Nephews:  We missed ya, Unca Scrooge!
Scrooge:  Missed me? What'd you throw at me?
Huey: No, we missed seeing you!
Scrooge: Did you, lads? Ich. [stammers] What happened to Duckworth?
Huey: Uh, he got tied up.
[Cut back to McDuck Manor, where we see that Duckworth is indeed tied up... in the curtains.]
Duckworth: This is definitely going to delay dinner.
[Cut back to Scrooge and the nephews.]
Scrooge: Well, since you're here, ye may as well look around.
Nephews: [run off] Oh boy!
Scrooge: But don't touch anything!
[One screen-wipe later, we see the nephews fishing in the vault.]
Louie: I got another one!
Dewey: [as Louie pulls his line in] It's a greenback snapper!
Huey: Aw, it's only a fifty. Throw it back!
[Just as Louie has pulled the dollar bill up, Scrooge comes in and grabs it.]
Scrooge: What do you think you're doing!?
Huey: We weren't gonna keep it!
Louie: We were just playin'!
Scrooge: Money is to be taken seriously. Didn't your Uncle Donald teach you anything?!
Huey: Sure. How to play ball.
Louie: How to cross the streets.
Dewey: And how to avoid strangers. Come on.
[The nephews sulkingly walk out of the vault.]
Scrooge: I'd rather face all the Beagle Boys than those three!
[And that's our cue to fade to the jail cell inhabited by three of the series' regular Beagle Boys - Big Time, Burger, and Bouncer. Big Time is writing tally marks on the wall while Bouncer rests on the prison cot and Burger reads a book.]
Big Time: As near as I can figure, we've hit Scrooge's Money Bin 299 times.
Bouncer: [yawns] Well, 300's the charm!
Burger: Yeah! But foist we gotta get outta here.
Prison guard: [passing by] Here y'go, boys. [drops a gift box into the cell] Someone's tryin' to sweeten your disposition. Enjoy!
[Burger jumps out of his chair and tears open the box to find...]
Burger: Oh boy! Bon-bons!
[He takes one out and eats it. The "bon-bon" then blows up inside him, and he burps.]
Prison guard: [from offscreen] Gesundheit!
Big Time: [covers Burger's mouth and calls to the guard] Eh, t'anks! [to Burger] Dose aren't bon-bons, Burger; dey're boom-booms!
Bouncer: Duh, look, Big Time, a note!
Big Time: [picks up the note that came in the box with the bombs and reads it] "Use these to escape tonight, then meet me at the L'Orange Theater. Signed, El Capitán." I don't know who this El Capitán is, but I sure like his... style!
[Back at the Money Bin, Scrooge is sitting in his office.]
Scrooge: If only boarding schools weren't so expensive! Ach, I need to cheer up. [presses his intercom button] Send in the solicitors!
Solicitor #1: [enters the office] Mr. McDuck, would you care to contribute to the Retired Panhandlers of America?
Scrooge: No! [presses a blue button, which opens a trap door underneath the solicitor, and laughs as the guy drops down the hole] Next!
Solicitor #2: [entering] Um, can you spare a--
[But before the guy can even mention who he's working for, Scrooge has a hose come out from the wall and spray him out of the office. Scrooge laughs even harder.]
Scrooge: I could do this all day! Next!
Junior Woodchuck recruiter: [entering] Sir, the Junior Woodchucks are devoted to-- [Scrooge presses a green button that causes two big mechanical arms to grab the recruiter and take him to the window] --uh, to keeping boys so bust collecting merit badges they can't get into trouble!
Scrooge: Tell me more.
[Meanwhile, the nephews are looking around the hallway.]
Louie: "Museum". Let's check it out! [he and his brothers enter that room] Aw, just more of Unca Scrooge's junk. Hey, look! [points to a small wooden ship on a pedestal]
Either Huey or Dewey: Neat! Unca Donald would love that!
Whichever one of them didn't say the last line: Let's take a closer look!
[Back in Scrooge's office, the recruiter, still being grabbed by the mechanical arms, is still giving his pitch.]
Recruiter: And finally, that famous fountain of knowledge, the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook!
[He takes a copy of the guidebook out of his suitcase and gives it to Scrooge. Suddenly, Scrooge hears an alarm going off.]
Scrooge: My museum! [presses another button on his desk] Bill me. [grabs his blunderbuss and runs out]
Recruiter: [as the mechanical arms throw him out the window] Thank yoooooooouuuu!
[Scrooge dashes to the museum when he suddenly sees the nephews stacked up, with Dewey taking the ship off of its stand.]
Huey: Oops! Whoooa!
[The nephews lose their footing and collapse, tossing the ship into the air. Scrooge manages to catch it and puts it back on the stand.]
Scrooge: I told you, no touching!
Huey: We were gonna send that junky old boat to Unca Donald!
Scrooge: "Junky"?! It's a priceless artifact!
Louie: But--
Scrooge: Until further notice, you are grrrrounded.
[The nephews hang their heads in shame.]
[That night, back at the jail, the Beagles have dug a small hole in the wall and placed some of the bombs in it. Big Time lights a match by striking it with his thumb.]
Burger: Can't I have just one?
Big Time: Shhh! Now get down!
[He proceeds to light the fuse on the bombs. One explosion later, the three Beagles are now out of the prison and make their way to...]
[...the O'Lorange Theater, which has obviously seen better days.]
Bouncer: Uh, Big Time, dis place gives me da creeps.
Big Time: So, where's this El Capitán character?
El Capitán: [appearing behind them] Right here, caballeros.
Big Time: [approaches him] Eh, pleased to meet ya. [extends his hand for a handshake, but then apparently decides against it] So why did you spring us anyway?
El Capitán: You are all experts on Scrooge McDuck's Money Bin. I want you to steal something from it for me.
Burger and Bouncer: Cash?
El Capitán: No, hombres, something much more valuable.
Big Time: Well, what's more valuable than three cubic acres of cash?
El Capitán: A small, wooden ship.
[Commercial break.]
[Meanwhile, back at McDuck Manor, Scrooge is pacing around his worry room as Duckworth watches.]
Scrooge: Donald dumped them in my lap, so now they're my responsibility. But curse their feathers! They're such troublesome little brats!
Duckworth: Indubitably, sir.
[The nephews, listening from outside, stick their heads in through the doorway and hear this next line:]
Scrooge: How did I let Donald talk me into taking care of those little beasts?!
[The nephews turn away from the worry room.]
Huey: I toldja he didn't want us!
Louie: Right! Let's get outta here!
[The nephews grab their suitcases and walk out the mansion's front door. Of course, if they'd stuck around longer, they'd have heard this:]
Scrooge: The worst thing about it is the little nose-punchers remind me of m'self at that age - cunning, sharp, resourceful.
Duckworth: Don't go soft, sir.
Scrooge: No, Duckworth, I've been wrong. I'm going to make it up to them in the morning.
[The nephews, however, are wandering the streets of Duckburg.]
Louie: Unca Donald'll take us back. You'll see!
[The camera suddenly cuts to El Capitan waiting by a lamp post not far from Scrooge's Money Bin.]
Huey: Hey, who's that? Looks suspicious.
Dewey: What's he starin' at?
Louie: Look! [points to the Money Bin, where we see that the door is open and a flashlight is being used inside] Someone's in Unca Scrooge's Money Bin!
Huey: Let's check it out! [The nephews apparently abandon their suitcases and run to the open door of the Money Bin.] Shhh.
[The nephews sneak in through the open door and walk down the hallway until they hear Big Time talking. The nephews hide behind the corner and see Big Time talking to Burger, who's holding the flashlight.]
Big Time: How do I know where this ship is?! What do I look like, a little wooden sailor!? Just look everywhere! Here, take the map, Burger.
[As he hands the map to Burger, Burger has trouble grabbing and lets the flashlight slip out of his hands and bounce off of Big Time's head. Big Time looks at his brother disapprovingly in response.]
Huey: [to his brothers] We gotta get help!
Bouncer: [shining his own flashlight on the nephews] Hey! Some kids! Grab 'em!
Louie: Run for it!
Big Time: Don't let 'em get away!
[The nephews make a run for it through the hallway. Dewey suddenly stops when passing by a fire hose.]
Dewey: Hey, a landing cable!
Bouncer: Hey! Come back, you rugrats!
[As the Beagles make their way in pursuit, Huey and Louie take the hose and stretch it across the sides of the hall so that when the Beagles come running up, they trip over it.]
Louie: [looking at the Beagles now piled on top of each other] A perfect three-punk landing! Hehehehe!
Huey: Head for the museum! I got an idea!
Big Time: [as the nephews dash off] Dast-blast the gosh-darn blankety heck!
[The Beagles pick themselves up and continue their pursuit as the nephews approach the pedestal with the wooden ship.]
Huey: Quick! The human ladder!
[Louie and Dewey stack up on top of their red-clad brother to perform that oddly-named strategy just as the Beagles show up, little realizing the nephews just led them to what they're looking for.]
Burger: Gotcha!
[Undaunted, Dewey grabs the ship, causing the alarm to go off and startle the Beagles. Back at McDuck Manor, Scrooge is woken from his sleep by the sound of the alarm.]
Scrooge: My Money Bin! [runs out of his room with his blunderbuss in hand] Duckworth, get the limo!
[Back at the bin...]
Big Time: Hey, dat's da ship! [walks over and pounds the pedestal it was on, stopping the alarm] Okay twerp, hand it over!
Dewey: No way, Beagle Bum!
[Big Time grabs Huey as they start running away, but Louie and Dewey jump off of him. Bouncer then grabs Dewey, who passes the ship to Louie, only for Burger to grab him and take the ship.]
Burger: Got it, Big Time!
Big Time: Great! Now let's get outta here!
[Scrooge's limo pulls up, but by now he's too late and the Beagles have already left with the ship. As Scrooge runs in with his blunderbuss, he bumps into the nephews, who fortunately happened to grab the map that the Beagles left behind.]
Nephews: Beagle Boys! Hurry! Quick! The Beagle Boys!
Scrooge: QUIET!!
[Back at McDuck Manor, Scrooge is in the attic, scolding the nephews.]
Scrooge: Running away from home, breaking and entering, lying about the Beagle Boys...
Louie: But they were THERE!
Scrooge: And didn't touch a single coin? Right.
Louie: No, Unca Scrooge, they were after the boat!
Scrooge: As I recall, the only thieves interested in that old relic were you three!
Dewey: [holding up the map] But we found a map!
Scrooge: Enough! It's late and I have an important interview in the morning at my candy factory. [places the Junior Woodchuck hats in front of the boys] Boarding school's not looking so expensive after all!
Huey: We were only tryin' to help...
[Scrooge just exists, slamming the door behind him.]
Dewey: [looking at the other side of the map] Hey, look what's on the other side of this - an old theatrical flier!
Either Huey or Louie: But the L'Orange Theater's been closed for years!
Dewey: You don't suppose...
All 3: The Beagle Boys' hideout!
Louie: [puts on one of the Junior Woodchuck hats and starts looking at the guidebook] We can get the ship back and show Unca Scrooge we're not as rotten as he thinks!
[One screen-wipe later, we see the boys are constructing a hang-glider.]
Dewey: Y'know, this Junior Woodchucks Guidebook is full of great ideas!
Huey: [checking outside the attic door] Rats! Duckworth's still guardin' the stairs!
Dewey: That's okay; this way'll be quicker anyway!
[Another screen-wipe later, the boys are at the attic window with their newly-completed hang-glider.]
Huey: Uh, maybe this isn't such a good idea. I mean, what do woodchucks really know about flyin' anyway?
Louie: There's only one way to find out. Geronimooooo! [the nephews take to the air] Hey, it works, just like book said!
Dewey: Great! Now how do we land?
Louie: Land? Ohh, I forgot to read that chapter!
Huey: What!?
[Just then, the hang glider hits the wall and breaks apart.]
Nephews: Yaaaaah!
[Fortunately, they land on the awning below and slide into Scrooge's pool.]
Huey: It may be quicker, but it sure is wetter!
[Later, at the L'Orange Theater, the Beagles are at a table on the stage, discussing the ship with El Capitan.]
Big Time: Sure, you sent us the explosives, but now that we have the ship...
[As Big Time continues speaking, the nephews pop up in the seats in front of the stage, keeping hidden from the bad guys' view.]
Dewey: Look! There's that suspicious guy we saw on the street.
Huey: Let's get a closer look.
[As the nephews move in to do just that, the camera focuses on the villains.]
El Capitan: Señor, the agreement was your freedom for the ship! I have kept my part of the bargain, so hand it over!
Big Time: Hey, not so fast, grampa! Foist, we wanna know why it's so valuable. A priceless antique?  An expensive work of art? Not talkin', eh? [he strikes a match against the table and prepares to set fire to the ship]
El Capitan: All right, I'll tell you! It's a map. It leads to a sunken treasure. A ship full of oro. Gold! But it is in code. Without me to interpret it for you mental midgets, it is worthless!
[As El Capitan speaks, the nephews are seen sneaking backstage and Louie starts untying a rope that's obviously supporting something above the stage.]
Big Time: Okay, Capitan, maybe we can talk a deal.
[Suddenly, a wrecking ball prop crashes through the table, causing the villains to toss the ship into the air. Dewey catches it and the Beagles come running at the triplets. Huey unties another support rope, causing a fake brick wall to land in front of the Beagles, who crash into it. The fake brick wall then falls on top of the three burglars.]
Louie: Let's get outta here!
[The nephews start running for the exit, but are stopped by El Captain, who has one of the chairs in one hand and a bat in the other.]
El Capitan: Give me the ship, ninos, or I'll play castanets with your empty little heads!
[Commercial break]
El Capitan: Give the ship to me, ninos.
[The Beagle Boys then rip off a piece of a curtain]
Big Time: Rush 'em!
[They then run behind the triplets and throw the curtain over them.  They then disappear underneath the curtain as Big Time lifts it up]
Big Time: What in the-? Don't just stand there. Help me! It's gotta be around here someplace.
[All three Beagle Boys jump around trying to find an area where the nephews could have disappeared.]
Burger: What does?
[A trap door opens up underneath them.]
Big Time: A trap door?
[The three fall into the trap as they land on some bags and cough.  Pans to the boys pushing to open the door.]
Huey: How'd you know there was a trap door, Dewey?
Dewey: I didn't.
El Capitan: No! They're getting away!
[The nephews manage to open the door and they run out with the Beagle Boys following them.]
El Capitan: Get them, you barnacles! No! No, no! I can't lose it now! Not again. Not again!
[The Beagle Boys run outside, where it is now suddenly morning. Big Time spots the nephews climbing an escape ladder.]
Big Time: There!
[On the roof, the nephews pause to catch their breath.]
Louie: I wish Unc! Scrooge was here. He's beat these turkeys a dozen of times!
Huey: Unca Scrooge! That's it! He's at his candy factory right now!
Dewey: Let's go!
[At the candy factory...]
Scrooge: This vat alone holds enough chocolate to make a candy bar the sized of my money bin: Reporter: Then how do you explain your phenomenal wealth, Mr. McDuck?
Scrooge: Simple, I made it while being smarter than the smarties and tougher than the toughies. And I deserve every penny, because--I made it square: [Cut back to El Capitan, who's climbing the escape ladder]
El Capitan: They're going to get away. They're going to get away.
[Back at the candy factory]
Reporter: Well, Mr. McDuck, your family must be very proud of you.
Scrooge: My what?
Reporter: Your family. The people you love: Scrooge: Well, I never really...That is, I-I-I-I...
Reporter: Surely there must be someone you spend your time with? After all, money isn't everything.
[As she talks, we briefly cut to the nephews, walking across telephone wires. We cut back to Scrooge.]
Scrooge: I'm very busy, you see, and well, no time for...to tell you the truth, my life is pretty lonely. If it weren't for those pesky nephews, I...Yes, my nephews! Oh, they're grand lads. Quick, feisty, just like me. We're all change out of the same dollar, if you know what I mean.
[As Scrooge talks, we cut back to the nephews still walking across that telephone wire as the Beagle Boys approach said wire from the rooftop. Big Time breaks the end of the wire (which somehow does not electrocute any of them) and shakes it, causing HD&L to jump up into the air, but they manage to grab onto the wire when they come back down. Big Time is nearly pulled off the roof by the wire but his brothers grab him and he loses the wire, sending the nephews swinging downward.]
HD&L: Yeow!
[Back at the candy factory...]
Scrooge: I wish they were here so you could meet them.
[As if on cue, HD&L come crashing through a window and land in a vat of yellow frosting. The boys stick their heads out and Louie holds up the ship.]
Louie: Unca Scrooge! We got your ship!
[Just then, the Beagle Boys come crashing through a window too, and land in a vat of gumballs. The vat is emptied, resulting in the Beagles scrambling around due to the gumballs under the feet.]
Reporter: Keep rolling, keep rolling!
Cameraman: They are!
[All of Scrooge's employees run like mad as the nephews approach him.]
Scrooge: What's going on?
Louie: It's a treasure map, Unca Scrooge! [hands Scrooge the ship]
Dewey: [pointing to the Beagles] And they want it!
[The Beagles fall flat on the floor.]
Scrooge: Get out of here, boys. I'll handle this.
Huey: No sir, Unca Scrooge!
Dewey: We're all in this...
Louie: Together!
Scrooge: Good, lads! [to the Beagles, who've just picked themselves up] Yoohoo! [calling from up on the railings] I've not yet begun to fight!
[Dewey gathers a big rubber band from one of the machines and a pie from a conveyor belt as Bouncer and Burger chase Scrooge. After turning a corner, Scrooge calls out...]
Scrooge: Fire, Dewey!
Dewey: Bon appetit!
[Dewey catapults the pie in Bouncer's face, sending him stumbling backward a bit. Scrooge then pulls a switch that opens a trap door under Bouncer's feet.]
Bouncer: [falling through the trap door] Whoa!
[Bouncer manages to grab the edge of the trap doorway, but Burger then stumbles into it, causing them to break through. The nephews walk up to Scrooge.]
Dewey: Where'd he go, Unca Scrooge?
Scrooge: To a tank of caramel!
Bouncer: Whoo hoo hoo hoo!
Scrooge: Hot caramel! Come on lads, one to go.
[Cut back to the reporter and cameraman.]
Reporter: [shaking the cameraman by his shoulders] Are you getting all this?
Cameraman: I'm trying, I'm trying!
[Huey is holding a hose and watches his brothers and uncle walk by when suddenly Big Time grabs him.]
Big Time: Hey McDuck, look what I got! I want my boys and the boat now, or else!
Dewey: Oh, no, Unca Scrooge! He's got Huey!
Scrooge: Don't give up the ship, boys. We're not through yet. [he whispers something to Dewey and Louie, and then they run off] All right, Big Time, it's a deal. We're releasing the others. Just don't harm the boy.
[Bouncer and Burger, covered in caramel, rejoin Big Time as Scrooge approaches him with the ship and gives it to him.]
Big Time: Whaddaya know, boys! Scrooge is a old softie after all! [kisses the boat] It's a pleasure doing business with youse, McDuck! [releases Huey and starts laughing]
Huey: [walking away with Scrooge] Sorry, Unca Scrooge.
Scrooge: Never mind. Just walk faster.
Big Time: What a sweet deal!
Scrooge: Sweeter than you think! [gestures to Dewey and Louie] Now, boys!
[Dewey and Louie flip a switch that turns over the giant vat of chocolate Scrooge was referring to earlier. The Beagle Boys turn around and realize the vat is tipping over them.]
Beagles: Aah!
[The chocolate floods out of the vat and overtakes the Beagle Boys, during which Big Time loses the ship, which sails over the chocolate like it was water, as the Ducks watch from the safety of the railings. We briefly cut to the exterior of the building to see chocolate flowing out the windows before cutting back to Scrooge and the nephews.]
Scrooge: Now that's what I call sweet revenge!
[The camera pans over to the Beagles, covered in chocolate, which hardens around them, as the reporter speaks.]
Reporter: This eyewitness coverage of the amazing capture of the Beagle Boys was brought to you live by this station.
[Scrooge finds the ship among the chocolate mess and pulls it out, leaving a ship-shaped indent behind and setting up an important plot point for the next episode, as he says...]
Scrooge: So lads, you weren't lying about the Beagle Boys. I should have trusted you.
Huey: Aw, that's okay, Uncle Scrooge: Scrooge: No, you deserve a reward. I'll move you from the attic to the garage!
[They all have a laugh when suddenly the Junior Woodchuck Recruiter from earlier runs into the candy factory.]
Junior Woodchuck Recruiter: I saw it all on television! It was incredible! No Woodchuck ever won so many merit badges in such a short time! Citizenship, urban survival, law enforcement, circus arts... [as he hands out the merit badges HD&L just earned, we see some police officers taking away the chocolate-covered Beagles] Which badge will you go for next?
Louie: How about treasure hunting, Uncle Scrooge?
Scrooge: Who knows? We make a great team. Don't we lads. Give me four!
Nephews: Aw, Unca Scrooge! [they clap his hand and then give him a big hug]
Scrooge: Ah, what a family!

El Capitan: You haven't won the treasure yet, McDuck. Beware!
