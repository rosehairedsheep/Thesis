Episode Info: Transcript: Gallery: Clips: The episode starts with the Three Caballeros beginning a performance.
Donald was about to sing, but immediately gets cut by Panchito, singing the song lyrics instead of him.
Panchito: [Singing] Hear my voice, As I'm calling out to you. [pushes Donald away from the microphone] Hear my voice. There are things I wish you knew...
José
Drop the beat! [Starts dancing on his own]
Panchito: Argh, I was getting to the good part!
José
Exactly! This is the good part!
Panchito tries to crash into José to stop him from dancing, but misses him. They both start fighting. Donald tries to stop them.
Donald: Guys! Guys! I don't think...
The stage that was set up in Scrooge's bathroom falls apart. Scrooge is sitting in the bathtub.
Scrooge: Sorry, to interrupt [Turns off the radio], BUT WHY ARE YOU IN MY BATHROOM?!
José
We wanted to give you a taste of our--
Panchito: As yet unpaid for--
José
Global tour! Now, we know how busy you are...
Panchito: But we also know how devastated you would be if you missed out on the chance to sponsor us!
Donald: (pops out of Scrooge's tub) We don't need money.
Panchito: (pops out of Scrooge's tub) All we need is equipment, a tour bus, a plane with our faces on it...
Scrooge: Grrrr...
José
That's ridiculous! Scrooge is far too busy and important to go plane shopping. (falls down in the tub)
Panchito: (pops out of Scrooge's tub) You're right, we'll take the money instead.
Donald: (pops out of Scrooge's tub) Fifty million, tops.
Panchito: A small price to pay to be a part of our band's rise to superstardom!
Scrooge: (shouting) DUCKWORTH!
Duckworth turns into Demonworth and Donald chuckles nervously.
Cut to outside the front porch, Demonworth chucks the Caballeros out the door.
Demonworth: No solicitors! [Slams the door shut.]
José
That's the fourth rich guy's bathroom we've been kicked out of.
Panchito: What are we doing wrong?
Donald: We just need someone to listen to us.
Louie: Oh, I'm listening... (Pops out of from a flower pot with his hood on) You wanna be famous?
Donald: Uh, sure.
Panchito: Absolutely!
José
More than anything!
Louie: And you are willing to do whatever I say, at any cost whatsoever?
Donald: Well, not any--
Panchito: Quiet Donald!
José
We'll pay you two fold!
Louie: Then, have I got a scheme for you.
Donald: Ho, boy...
Intro plays.
Cutting to later in the triplets room.
Louie: The fastest way to fame is Emma Glamour's IT-list. [Shows the IT-List on his laptop]
Three Caballeros: Oooohhh!
Dewey emerges from under a duvet in the second bunk.
Dewey: I know everything about the IT-List! [Crawls down from the bunk] Whatever Emma Glamour post on her annual online list become instantly popular! How do you think I found my favorite band? [Points on a placat with the band The Feather Weights] And my signature hairstyle? [Shows the Three Caballeros the hairstyle on Louie's computer]. If I'm following the trends right, I think next years big thing is gonna be sick yo-yo tricks. [Casts a yo-yo, but by a mistake bound himself with it] Ow. I'll get it before the IT-List comes out!
Louie: Yeah, sure you do...
Dewey falls on the floor.
José
We must get on this blog!
Donald: But how?!
Panchito: Why would no one tell us?!
Louie: Okay, bllrp, okay. Just look! Emma Glamour is a famous taste-maker, who only emerges once a year to post her It-List at--
Dewey: [Gets up] --an exclusive party at the Duckburg Museum! A night of famous people celebrating how great they are! These... are my people. We're going?!
Louie: I'll get you in to that party!
Panchito: We perform for Glamour!
José
We get on the IT-List before it's posted online!
Donald: Then we'll be famous throughout the planet!
Dewey: Internet fame, the most important fame of all.
Donald: I don't know... How do we get in?
Louie: Hmm... This is an exclusive party... If only someone had a super elaborate scheme to get in... Kaboom! [Louie show the three caballeros his scheme] I give you... Louie's Eleven! A multi-part, multi-person plan guaranteed to get us in... The perfect scheme.
Dewey: Ah, cool. [About to touch the board] Maybe if we--
Louie: [Slaps Dewey's hand off of the board] Please don't touch the perfect scheme!
Dewey: But I know all about this party!
Louie: And I know all about schemes, dear Dewford! All you have to do is listen to me... Aaand sign this legally binding contract, give me half of any money you make after you're famous.
Donald: WHAT?! We can't!
Panchito: I already signed for you Donald!
José
GIMME THE PEN!
Donald: [Sighs, but signs the contract anyway]
Louie: All eleven have an important role. I'm the team leader, obviously. Caballeros, you're "The Talent".
Dewey: And I'm the inside man, because I know this party in and out!
Louie: What? No, but don't worry, I have a very special job just for you.
Dewey: Oh-ho, ho-ho-ho... Special!
Louie: This party is for invite-only, so we are gonna need...
Huey: HA! And you said calligraphy camp was a waste of time!
Louie: [Kisses the forged autograph] Hubert, it is perfect! Welcome to the scheme.
Huey: What scheme?
Louie: Nothing.
Dewey: Tell no one!
Louie: Next, we're gonna need a way to communicate all sneaky-like.
Gyro: Alright. These earpieces are definitely not experimental, I'm... [Handing out the earpieces] definitely not testing them on you, and they... definitely won't explode in your heads if you wear them too long. Have fun at your party!
Cuts to the Duckburg Museum.
Louie: And lastly, we need to figure out the party layout inside the museum, which we are doing now.
-
Louie: [Looking through the museum window] There's Glamour's seat and there's the stage.
Someone walks down from the stage, with orange thin legs with black heels and bow knots and a pink overcoat. The head was shown with fluffy hair and a black ribbon bow. The face is shown of a girl Duck with teal eyeshadow. She whistles with her fingers, then goes down the stage.
Daisy: Let's go, everyone! We want to start fashionably late, not late late. And remember, nobody gets on stage without a stage pass.
Donald: Who is that?!
Louie: Ugh, Daisy Duck. Glamour's personal assistant. If we want to get to Glamour, we have to go through her.
While Louie observes Daisy, Donald looks at her in amazement. Daisy smiles as she looks at everything looking fine as Donald's eyes look mesmerized before he shakes it off.
Donald: Whatever.
Daisy: Nice placement on the banner, Rosa. Those shrimp puffs could be puffier, Shawn. [Gasps] Are these rhododendrons?! We gotta get them out of here before-- [Glamour sneezes] She... shows up.
Glamour: Are those... rhododendrons?
Daisy: Run, I'll handle it.
Glamour: You know I'm allergic to bad taste.
Daisy: Of course, Ms. Glamour! I mean, who would bring rhododendrons to your party? A rhodo-dumb-dumb? [Lets out a forced laugh]
Glamour: Mmh. You have narrowly avoided ruining this party.... for now.
Daisy: Oh, thank you, Ms. Glamour. I promise, everything's going to be--
Louie: --Perfect.
Dewey: It already is. I'm gonna dance on the red carpet!
Louie: No! Stick to the plan! This is "Louie's Eleven", as long as there are no surprises we'll be fine.
Percival P. Peppington: I swear! I left the invitation on the limo! It's parked right around the side, I'll go get it!
Falcon Graves: No party crashers. Wait a minute, was that...?
-
Dewey: Why is Falcon Graves working security here? He's gonna recognize me and now we're not invited to the party!
José
Maybe he won't remember you.
Dewey: The last time I saw him I cost him two millions of dollars and threw him off a building.
Donald: Oof...
Panchito: That does make this harder... New plan: Dewey's not going to the party!
Dewey: Oh, WHAT?! You need me in there, this is the Dewey-est party in town! Oh, why was I cursed to be so flashy and unforgettable?
Louie: Hmm...
-
Louie: Okay, Dewey, play it cool.
DJ Daft Duck: [Sound effect] C-C-C-Coolest, baby! Woosh!
-
Graves: There's something familiar about you...
Louie: Hey, pal! This is DJ Daft Duck, Duckburg's most electrfiying funkatronic DJ and his entourage, as you can see from our very official invitation.
DJ Daft Duck: [Sound effect] Fuuuuuuuun times! [Cheering sound effect]
-
Daisy: Graves, keep the lines moving!
Graves: Welcome to the party, pal.
-
Dewey: We did it!
Louie: Well, thanks to Dewey showing off, we almost got busted.
Dewey: WHAT?! This whole party is for showing off, I know how it works.
Louie: No more improvising, no more showboating. Everyone listens to my plan.
-
Panchito: The plan to wow Glamour with our haunting melodies.
José
You mean our sick dance beats.
-
Donald: Guys, stop it...
-
Louie: Look, Uncle Donald's right. Earpieces in.
-
Louie: Alright, split up.
They all split up.
Louie: José, Panchito, head to the stage by the guard.
-
Panchito: I will charm my way on stage with my golden ways... What are you going to do? Dance your way past her?
Louie: Easy, grown-ups. You won't be able to get past the guard without...
-
Louie: ...Daisy's stage pass. We've gotta distract Daisy so that Uncle Donald can steal it.
Dewey: So I'll dazzle Daisy with my hip and stylish yo-yo tricks. [The yo-yo hits his eye] Ow.
Louie: Oh, that would be greaaat, Dewey. but it's just not part of the plan. Your very important job is coming up. Jane, you're a go.
-
Jane: Yes, sir, Mr. Duck.
Daisy: Everything is on schedule and under control. Time to party! I'm very excited for you to see my outfit...
-
Jane: Oh, I'm so sorry.
Daisy: Grr, why you no-good--
Glamour: Daisy, please. You're embarassing us both. Mostly yourself though.
Daisy: So sorry, I- I'll go clean up.
-
Louie: Excellent work, Jane... as always. Uncle Donald, get that stage pass.
-
Louie: And now that Glamour is unguarded, I'll lay on the Louie charm. Time for her to get excited for the Three Caballeros big performa-- Aw, phooey!
-
Graves: No photographs. [Crushes the phone]
Dewey: Grave is gonna sniff out our plan. How do we get rid of him?
Louie: This is your moment. The job that only you can do.
-
Dewey: AAAAAH! This is my job?! Holding a monster?!
Louie: Not monster, team member.
Dewey: I could be doing more! How is this the perfect job for me?!
Louie: Because everyone else already have a job.
-
Graves: An intruder? Not tonight.
-
Daisy: Rassafrasin party... Rassafrasin It-list... [Kicks a vase] HI-YAH! This is your shot to prove yourself to Ms. Glamour... Take it!
-
Louie: Remember, you've got to grab the stage pass and get off, then our tenth member stop the elevator, keeping Daisy on lockdown and out of the way.
-
Webby: This party is the coolest.
-
Donald: Beautiful night, isn't it?
Daisy: Kind of a terrible night, actually. What floor?
Donald: Oh, uh... Whoops!
Daisy: Great, not like I was in a hurry or anything.
Donald: Oh, sorry. I'm in your space, I got it.
Louie: Alright, he's got it. Webby, cut the elevator power.
-
Donald: Whoa!
Daisy: Hang on, let me just-- Oh, you're making it worst...
Webby: WEEEEE!
-
Donald: Oh no... Oh no, oh no, oh no!
Daisy: [Overlapping with Donald] I gotta get back to the party!
Donald: [Overlapping with Daisy] Someone, let us out of here!
Daisy: This is all your fault!
Donald: My fault? It's- Uh... It's your bag...
-
Louie: Whoa, okay, Uncle Donald meet José and Panchito at the stage with the pass for your performance. I'm going radio silent. [Turns off the earpiece]
-
Donald: I'm gonna miss my big break!
Daisy: (Suddenly suspicious) What do you mean "big break"?
Donald: My band is sort of... uh... crashing the party?
(Daisy is suddenly shocked and surprise)
Dewey: I'm back! What do I do now? Network with rich and famous? Or I could walk the dog, eh? What do you think?
Louie: I'm going to talk to Emma Glamour to convince her how great the Caballeros are. You do nothing.
Dewey: Come on, let me talk to Glamour. We all like the same things because she tells me what to like! Why won't you listen to me?
Louie: Because your plan is ridiculous! Come on, man, we're so close. Let's just do it my way.
Yeah... okay.
Dewey: -
Louie: Man, thought this place was supposed to be cool, but Three Caballeros aren't even playing. Oh, hi. Louie Duck, Louie's List. It's like your blog, but only younger, cooler, and listier, you know, he-heh.
Glamour: What is your plan here exactly?
Louie: I'm sorry, what?
Glamour: Ooh, let me guess. You had this whole elaborate scheme to get on the IT-list and make yourself rich and famous. What do you do, manage a band or something? Happens every year. You're nothing new. You're not original. There is nothing "IT" about you, so tell me. Why whould I ever listen to you? Disappear now, good bye.
-
José
Epa! Isso! Bonito rebola menina! Well, I've tried everything... Where is Donald and that stage pass?
Panchito: Oi, this is impossible! Can no one get past these guards?
-
Jane: I'm using the money for college. I don't wanna be at Funzo's forever.
Webby: Why not?
-
Graves: Ladies and gentlemen, your attention... This is a robbery.
-
Graves: Everybody stay calm. Once my team has secured the museum, we can finally get what we came here for.
-
Louie: I had it all planned out! How was I supposed to know Louie's Eleven wasn't the only scheme tonight?
Dewey: Wait, Louie's Eleven... [Counting his fingers] Who's number eleven?
Louie: That's it! I know the plan was perfect. "The Enforcer", the guy you call when everything goes bad. I'll show her who's not it. Number eleven... You're our last hope.
-
Louie: NO!
Graves: That was odd. Now, Ms. Glamour, give me your phone.
-
Daisy: Almost... Almost.... Oh, just stay still!
(They finally managed to remove it. As Donald opens his eyes wide, he suddenly looks up at Daisy in amazement)
Daisy: Oh, this darn stain, seeping through my coat and onto my dress...
(Daisy removes her coat, revealing a colorful shoudlerless dress. She rubs off on it as an aurora surrounds her body. She looks at Donald)
Donald: (amazed) Whoa, nice dress!
Daisy: (Suddenly delighted) Oh, (she spins around) you like it? I mean, of course you do. I made it myself. I was hoping Glamour would see it and put me on her IT-List, then I could be a real designer. (She looks back at Donald cross) But that's not gonna happen since you got us stuck in here with your band's dumb plan! (Donald looks speechless as Daisy subsides her anger into sadness) Ugh, not that she ever listens to me anyway.
Donald: Nobody listens to me either.... They don't understand me.
Daisy: That's weird, I understand you perfectly.
-
Daisy: Well, we've got time. Alright, Mr. Big Shot, sing me something.
-
Donald: (singing badly)
Hear my voice: As I'm calling out to you: -
Donald: (singing)
Hear my voice: There are things I wish you'de knew: For even if my heart is strange: And hard to understand: I'll give all that I have for you: I'll help you take a stand: So hear my voice: As I'm calling out for you: Hear my voice: There are things I wish you'd knew: So hear my voice....
Hear my voice.....
-
Donald: (singing badly)
Hear my voice.....
-
Daisy: Get up.
Donald: What?
Daisy: Ms. Glamour's gonna hear us both, whether she wants to or not!
-
Daisy: What happened while we were in that elevator?!
Donald: My kids!
Daisy: Where's Ms. Glamour?! Wait, you have kids?
-
Glamour: Give that back! I need to post a very negative review of your work on my blog. You, sir, are not IT!
Graves: I don't take orders from you anymore. I've stolen your precious phone, the key to your company, and sold it to the highest bidder. And here... he...
-
Graves: Oh no, not again... Not Mark Beaks!
Beaks: Ho-ho, Grave-sy, long time no crime!
Graves: You're the buyer?!
Beaks: Um, a phone that can make me the most buzzworthy person on the internet? Shhya, boye!
Glamour: Ugh, Marcus.
-
Beaks: HA! Look who's gonna make the IT-List now, MOM! Pew, pew-pew-pew-pew!
-
Graves: Mom?!
Dewey: Huh, that actually makes a lot of sense. Okay, Lou. You're in charge, what do we do now?
Louie: I don't know? I-I thought I had it all planned out, but I have no idea what I'm talking about here.
Dewey: But I Dew-ey!
Louie: Stop, they'll grab you to!
Dewey: Nerp, because I know exactly what these people want. Just listen to me for once.
-
Beaks: Oh my gosh, he's the worst! But... fascinating somehow?
Graves: I want to look away, but I... can't...
-
Gabby: It's grotesque...
....but amazing.
-
Louie: Good plan Dewey.... is a thing I'd never thought I'd say!
-
Glamour: The failure of it is ridiculous... and beautiful! That is IT.
Beaks: What? No way, give me that phone!
-
Graves: That's it! I'm going to take you both out and end this infuriating family once and for all!
Daisy: Sorry, that's not on my party schedule.
They look up.
Donald: YIPPE KAY-YAY, MR. FALCON!
The phone flies into Dewey’s hand. He smiles as he runs off: Graves: Team! Get that phone! Team?
-
José
Nice singing.
Panchito: Nice moves.
-
Webby: Ooh, nice dagger!
Gabby: It was my mother's blade, the only clue to my parentage and--
-
Jane: I gotta get outta Duckburg...
-
Daisy: (screams in rage) THAT'S FOR RUINING OUR BIG CHANCE! AND THE PARTY I'VE BEEN PLANNING FOR MONTHS! I WILL NOT BE RECOMMENDING YOUR SERVICE TO OTHERS!
-
Glamour: DAISY! (Daisy gasp when she sees her boss walking up to her) This is YOUR fault! You--
Donald: (cutting in, which agasps Daisy) NO! LISTEN! DAISY DIDN'T WRECK YOUR PARTY, SHE SAVED IT, (Daisy smiles touched) SO SIT DOWN!
-
Manny: Love your blog!
-
Glamour: No one speaks to me that way.
Daisy: (standing up) Well, they do now!
-
Glamour: Well, okay then. Nice dress, it's on the list.
-
Panchito: AHAAAAAAAA....
Donald & José
DROP THE BEAT!
-
Beaks: Ugh, mooooom, this party's so booorrriiiing.......... Can we goooooooooo?
-
Louie: Well, Louie's Eleven wasn't exacly a perfect scheme.
Dewey: Hey, we got it to the party and survived a hostage situation.
Louie: Thanks to you. You know, I'm actually working on a new con, and... really like to hear your advice on it.
Dewey: "The Dewey Dozen"? Oh, our brotherhood is the greatest scheme of all....
-
Donald: Hear my voice...
-
Manny: Hey, you're messing with my mojo!
Donald: As I'm calling out to you, hear my voice....
-
Dewey: Still, too bad the Three Caballeros didn't make the IT-List on account of Uncle Donald's voice being, you know, terrible.
Louie: The worst.
Daisy: Oh, I don't know. I can listen to it allll night...
