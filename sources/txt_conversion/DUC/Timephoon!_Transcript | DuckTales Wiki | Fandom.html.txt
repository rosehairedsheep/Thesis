Episode opens with a shot of Killmotor Hill in the middle of a storm.
Roxanne: Here in Duckburg, life is like... a hurricane? Residents are battening down the hatches for the worst El Pato storm in decades.
(Dewey and Webby pass the cans to a pile)
Dewey: Hey, Louie?
Louie: AAAH! What?
Webby: Can you give us a hand?
(They laugh, Louie pats Webby)
Dewey: All right, okay, eheheh.
Webby: Nope!
-
Beakley: Mr. Chunky's Extra Chunky Chili Chunks?
Dewey: We could be stuck here for days. You said we we should get plenty of food we won't get sick of.
Beakley: I said won't get sick from, and you know it. I doubt your mother would approve of (???)
-
Della: What? Chilli cheese dogs put the "hooray" in "hooraycane party", it's no big deal!
Beakley: Until we're on day 8 with nothing but chili cheese dogs and we all get scurvy.... again.
Della: Beakley! You gotta let kids be kids, don't sweat the small stuff.
Beakley: Is this your parenting strategy or things you read off a bumper sticker?
Della: Honk if you're a great mom! Honk honk!
-
Louie: NOTHING, I SWEAR! Heeeey, Hue! W-why don't you tell everybody what you're up to in great length?
Huey: I'm almost done with my comprehensive report on cave ducks! After months of research, I've written my masterpiece. This is my chance to get an entry into.... (sniffs) the new addition of the Junior Woochuck Guidebook.
Dewey: My brother's gonna be a professional nerd.
-
Scrooge: We need to bring in all these valuable heirlooms for the garage before the storm hits.
Louie: I'm sorry, "valuable"?
Scrooge: These are the famous canes of Clan McDuck, going aaall the way back to our very earliest ancestors.
Louie: Oh.... sentimental value, yuck! Anyway, I've got important- Uuuh, stuff, to take care of... in... my room..... so... mm.
Scrooge: That boy's up to something...
-
Launchpad: Whoops.
-
Scrooge: Launchpad, euh... wh- why don't you keep an eye of Louie upstairs? Far away from here.
Launchpad: No problem, Mr. McDee.
-
Launchpad: Hey, Louie, wait up!
-
Launchpad: Louie?
-
Louie: Launchpad, I can explain...
Launchpad: You've got your own tub?! Lucky.
Intro plays.
Louie: Step in to the future of treasure hunting: the past.
-
Louie: Borrowing Gyro's time tub here, the keen minds at Louie Incorporated can track down famous lost treasure at the exact moment before they were lost!
-
Caveduck: Ho... Bubba!
-
Louie: No risking time, resources, or you know, our lives,  navigating dangerous temples filled with curses and booby traps like this poor fellow.
-
Louie: And because these treasures were never found, taking them doesn't effect the time stream. Just  bwamp to the past, take the artifact....
-
Louie: ...and return to home a little bit richer. Time Treasures, a subsidiary of Louie Inc. It's not a crime if it's lost at time. Any questions? Keeping in mind, again, that it is not a real tub and cannnot be used for bubble baths.
-
Huey: ...and so the simple caveduck gave way to more advanced...
-
Webby: What was that?
Dewey: I think I see something out there. Let's check it out.
Scrooge: Come back, the storm is starting!
Della: Eeeeh what are they gonna find out there, a little rain? Some debris?
Dewey: Hey, cool, a dead guy!
-
Huey: A caveduck....
Webby: Aww... Hey, little guy.
-
Dewey: Ooh, maybe he was frozen on an iceberg...
Webby: ...and the iceberg melted and he was washed ashore with the storm!
Scrooge: Yeah, pffffft.... frozen in an iceberg. Preposterous!
Webby: It happened to you twice.
-
Huey: A real.... life.... CAVEDUCK?! He could prove my report is accurate to the Junior Woochuck Council and guarantee my entry gets in the new guidebook!
Della: Great!
Beakley: Aaaand possibly disrupt all of time.
Della: Aww.... But it's one little caveduck.
Beakley: Small problems can turn into big problems if not prevented early. Step a butterfly in the past......
Della: Duuuude, why would you step on a butterfly? That's sick, lady. Sick!
Beakley: It's a hypotethical situation.
Della: Good! Keep it that way. Kids, take him to the TV room before the butterfly basher here gets to him.
Beakley: No no, I-
Scrooge: We'll deal with these crisis in order of importance. Strange storm first, caveduck second.
-
Huey: History's alive!
-
Huey: I made this shelter based on cave paintings from your time! I couldn't find any "mastodon fur, so I iiiimprovised. Just like home, huh? No, you're right. Cozy blankets are no substitute for mastodon fur. Hey!
Webby: Hahaha! He's got a hat like a person.
Dewey: Webby, please. This is serious. Be-be-be-bew, bew, bew!
Huey: Duckus lopithicus is not a joke! He doesn't understand your funky fresh ways. I've reconstructed some rudimentary caveduck language. Ooh! Ooga! Ah! Ah! Aaaah?!
Caveduck: Ba, ba, Bubba!
Webby: Maybe Bubba is his name. Hi, I'm Wabba!
Huey: That's ridiculous. He can't understand modern language, Webby. I'll offer him some tree bark and leaves as a piece offering.
-
Bubba: Mmm.... Bubba grubba.
Huey: Caveducks. Do not. Eat. Cheese dogs!
Dewey: They do now!
Webby: Man, I am learning so much!
-
Huey: Here, here! at least try the bark!
-
Louie: Ah, the problem with being this succesfl is finding enough closets to hide your loot. Eheheh.
Launchpad: So we're not doing anything worng because we're finding lost treasures, but before they were lost. So we're finding.... found treasures? Isn't that.... stealing?
Louie: First of all, those pirates never reclaim their treasures. And also, they were pirates! Doesn't it just break your heart to think of all this treasure? Alone? In the ground? Unloved?
Launchpad: So it's kinda like we're saving it?
Louie: It is exactly like that. I have plan for every possibility. There is no way the Time Treasure, a subsidiary of Louie Inc, has any side effect whatsoever!
-
Huey: He shouldn't be exposed to wheels... for another 10000 years!
Dewey: Louie! We got a new brother! He's a caveduck. and his name is Bubba.
Louie: I'm sorry, what's his now?
Dewey: Wanna hear his theme song? Bubba, bubba... that's all I've got.
-
Bubba: Bubba.... flubba?
Dewey: Ooh, that's good! Lyrical genius this guy.
-
Beakley: Della, clearly you can see there is a problem here?
Della: Kids. If you're gonna let the caveduck skateboard in the house, he should be wearing a helmet. Problem solved, good parenting Della.
-
Bubba: Bubba tuba! Bubba tuba!
-
Webby: Ooooh, what does tubba mean?
-
Louie: Oh, nothing... hehe, it's just caveduck nonsense, ehehe... Shut uppa, man.
-
Launchpad: If the caveduck is here, are we in the past?!
Louie: Don't think about it too hard, okay? It's one little caveduck. This will have no effect on the timeline... probably.
-
Launchpad: Hey, it's those pirates!
Louie: Okay, it might have a tiny effect on the timeline.
