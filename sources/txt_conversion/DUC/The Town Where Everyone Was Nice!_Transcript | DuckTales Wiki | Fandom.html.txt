The episode opens with Donald, followed by Louie, Webby, Huey, Dewey, Scrooge and two pig tourists walking through a forest. The male pig takes a photo with his camera. While a South American bird flies overhead, the tourists all reach a town with a banner reading "Bem-vindos A Festa Da Flor" and a spiky plant in the center with roots coming out of the ground.
(Music)
Webby: The Feast of The Flower! A festival of food, dancing, and music that celebrates the once a year bloom of the legendary Drosera occidendum, a one of a kind flower.
Louie: Never heard of it.
Webby: Me neither! A cultural tradition I know nothing about! Do you know how rare that is? (Dewey takes a picture) What are you doing?
Dewey: Documenting my adventures. The people would wanna feel like they were here with me. This place is going to look great on my profile.
Webby: It already looks great.
Dewey: But now it's in sepia. Ehhh? Eeeeeeeehehehe?
Donald: Oh boy, I can't wait to see my pals!
Louie: Sorry, who are these friends of yours?
Huey: And why haven't we heard of them? And why did you all stop speaking? And...
Louie: Please, not everything is a dark family secret.
Donald: Kids, I have a dark family secret.
'(Huey grins at being correct)
Donald: I...
Kids: Yeah...?
Donald: ...was one of the Three Caballeros.
Kids: (Nodding not knowing who the Three Caballeros Are) Oh yeah, Three Cabababa..., Oh.... Good for you..., Ooooooh....... Cool..... , I don't know what that is.
Scrooge: The Three Caballeros. Donald's old college band. They practiced that polyphonic pandemonium in my garage for hours on end. Oh, the next time you complain about bagpipes, just imagine trying to sleep while your uncle saws away at an accordion.
(Louie and Huey make eye contact cringing)
Donald: I was so awesome. (Puts on fanny-pack & Sunscreen)
Scrooge: Ah, your fine as is. A family man, a boat owner! You're more impressive than those two warbling whistlers are.
All: (Gasp)
(Jośe parachutes from a plane)
Jośe: Ha-ha!
(José blows into his black umbrella, trumpeting, Panchito's appears playing a guitar, they both are on the ground fireworks explode behind them, everyone was impressed)
Scrooge: Oh, they are much more impressive than you.
(Fast version of the Theme song plays)
José
Donald!
Three Caballeros: (Doing a unique greeting) Squawk, crow, quack, I got your back!
Huey: Secret hand shake?! Cool!
Louie licks Huey's hand.
Panchito: Haha! Saludos, amigos! Surely you remember old Panchito and José!
José
Os patinhos! Oh, last time we saw you, you were just little eggs. (To Donald) Ey, you remember when you insisted you could juggle the eggs?
Panchito: Hahaha, and you dropped one!
(Louie and Huey look at each other and then to do dewey who blinks oddly, Louie and Huey nod)
Scrooge: Now just who is paying for this little vacation?
José
Ha, Scrooge. The same old miser, eh? I've taken care of everyone's stay. As a travel consultant and global taste-maker, I'm always being asked to sample the best places, the best food, the best everything! We thought my jet-setting to be nice to spend the night on solid ground.
Panchito: It's my agent, again. When you are an international-pop sensation, you are but a slave to fame. Panchito, sign my baby. Panchito, present at this award show and also win most of the awards... There's no stop, my friends, but this weekend? The Three Caballeros ride again! Just like old times, eh amigos?
Dewey: Tell us everything embarrassing about Uncle Donald!
José
Embarassing? Your uncle was the cool one. Always off on globe-trotting adventures...
(Donald struggle to get his hand unstuck from the fanny-pack)
Panchito: What are you now? Oh, a super spy? A world famous DJ? Some insane combination of the two?
José
Surely you're super successful and impressive.
(Donald hiding with Huey & Scrooge from The Three Caballeros)
Huey: Breathe, just breathe: Donald: I've done nothing with my life, I'm a failure!
Scrooge: Aw, that never bothered you before.
Huey: Uncle Donald, you're very successful! You raised three boys and a rich in love. Isn't that the true measure of success?
Donald & Scrooge: No!
Donald: Huey, you gotta help me!
Huey: Help you? Well, I have been looking to earn my improve theater merit badge... How about you play the part of someone successful?
Donald: Lie? Perfect!
Scrooge: Nonsense. You do what you want, but I will not help you lie to impress that band of braggartios.
Huey: If you blow up our cover, Jose will probably get mad and you'll have to pay for this trip yourself.
Scrooge: Donald we have to lie to your friends, ya hear?!
Huey: Just keep it small and simple.
Huey: Sorry, everyone. Uncle Donald had a, um, very important business call.
Donald: From McDuck Enterprises, my company. I'm a billionaire.
Panchito: The same Donald, who searched our couch cushions for corn chips, now owns McDuck Enterprises?
Huey: Yes... aaand, he's taking over the family business so Scrooge can retire.
Scrooge: Geh?!
Donald: 'Cause he's sooo old... Very, very old....
Scrooge: BECAUSE I'M SO-!
(Huey signaling that if he breaks cover, he's paying for the trip)
Scrooge: So... So old.... So very, very old.... Oooooh, Donald, is that you? (Slaps Donald) My eyes are as clouded as my mind...(Slaps Donald again)
Jośe: Taking care of his uncle's legacy, a man of great wealth and kindness.
(Scrooge slaps Donald yet again)
Webby: Long ago, an invading force let a bloody massacre that left the town empty. From the wreckage, a single flower grew, proving that no matter how terrible a tragedy, life will always find a way to bloom anew. Now, the town celebrates this triumph every year... Or something like that. My Portuguese is a little enferrujado.
Dewey: Webby, get out of the way, you're ruining my shot with your story!
Webby: My story provides context for your photo.
Dewey: Of course, this is a moment of a cultural significance... Louie, get a full-body shot, hit it.
Louie: Okay, now look thoughtful... No, not confused... Oh, okay, that's the stuff!
(Webby groans and we see montage of the pitcures)
Jośe: I know it's not on the menu but, can we get some deep fried cassava, oh you have to try it it melts right into your mouth: Panchito: Please the adventurous billionaire, must have a refined palate.
Donald: I'll have the {i couldnt understand} Macaroni and Cheese: Huey: Thanks for ordering for me uncle Donald, he will have the moqueca {i couldn’t understand either}
Donald: ___
Panchito: Oh I’m so sorry, here let Panchito wipe your troubles away, which coincidentally is the title of my new album. A keepsake to remember me: Waitress: Thank you.
José
Classic Brazilian hospitality.

(Waitress comes with the bill. José, Donald and Panchito whistle)
José
Okay we can not all whistle inconspiculously.
Panchito: Lets setttle this like adults. Donald should pay because he's the billionare!
Doanld: Haha, right....
Donald reaches for Scrooge's wallet, Scrooge slaps his hand away. Donald and Scrooge scowl at each other. Slapping can be heard.
Huey: Haha, excuse me for a moment...
(Huey grabs the wallet and bites down on Scrooges hand. Giving the wallet the Donald.)
Donald: And a heffty tip: Scrooge: Grrrrr: Huey: Come'on Uncle Scrooge you should rest.

Huey: You can't put a price on that smile.
Scrooge: That lunch cost me $351.41 cents.
Huey: Oh, just let him have this.
(Panchito is seen throwing José up in the air, José spins and plays with Panchito and Donald)
Huey: (VO) It's only for one weekend.
Huey: (Shouting) WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU'RE GETTING THE BAND BACK TOGETHER?!
Panchito: Oh, people love a comeback! Think of the headlines: "Panchito Reunites with Old Friends, Rockets to a Number Somehow Higher Than Number One!"
José
I'll talk to some of my people. Perhaps we can play na Fiesta da flor! Why stop with the festival? (Huey and Scrooge look at eachother)
Panchito: Donald, you can pay for a tour, right?
Donald: (Pulls out Scrooge's wallet) Absolutely!
(Huey confronts Scrooge)
Panchito: No broken-down station wagons like the old days! Only the top-of-the-line! The Three Caballeros opening for (Pulls out his two phones) Panchito Pistoles! (José and Donald stares at him) Eh, we can work out who opens for who later.
(José and Panchito exits the restaurant, Scrooge tackles Donald)
Donald: Hey, what's the big idea?
Scrooge: (fights Donald) Waste my money on a tour! No-good spendthrift! (pulls Donald's muscle) And you owe me for lunch!
(Huey whistles)
Donald: Huh?
Huey: I think you've lost yourself in the role here. Maybe it's time to stop acting and tell the truth.
Donald: No way! I need this! (Donald gets up) I gotta go tune my instrument.
(Scrooge picks up his wallet)
Donald: And buy an instrument. Can I...? (snatches Scrooge's wallet and runs off)
Scrooge: (Growling)
Webby: (walks to the coffee cart) Excuse me Señora. I am thirsty for knowledge! Could I ask you some questions?
Cart lady: Of Course!
Webby: When was the first bloom?
Cart lady: Thank you!
Webby: Huh makes sense.
Cart lady: Have a great day!
