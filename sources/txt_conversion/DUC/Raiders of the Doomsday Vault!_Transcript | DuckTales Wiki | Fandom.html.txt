The episode commences with a shot of the Sunchaser flying and twirling around as both Della and Dewey are heard cheering with joy. Camera cuts to Della flying the plane normally.
Della: I missed you, girl. The Cloudslayer flies again!
Dewey: Cloudslayer? That is way better than the Sunchaser! [Della twirls the plane around again as she cheers] Why would Huey and Louie wanna miss this?!
Scrooge is seen falling after losing balance from all the twirling until he finally gets back on his feet and holds back a possible regurgitation.
Scrooge: I think I may have some idea.
Dewey: Their loss. Dewey and Della Duck on their first high-flying adventure!
Scrooge: Not ad-venture; business venture. [Pointing his finger towards a facility on their way] We're headed to Boarway, home of the Von Drake Doomsday Vault.
Della & Dewey: Ooooh! [They appear excited.]
Scrooge: The sterile seed depository.
Della and Dewey suddenly change their facial expressions to a bored and disappointed look.
Scrooge: [Takes out and unfolds a poster from his coat with a picture of Ludwig Von Drake and the Doomsday Vault] My old colleague, Ludwig Von Drake collected millions of seeds for safe-keeping in case of apocalypse. [Folds and puts the poster back in his coat] Unfortunately, the vault's been damaged by melting permafrost. We must convince the owners to hire McDuck Bin Securities to fix it. [Crosses his arms and focuses on Della with a concerned stare] IF we get there in one piece.
Della: Please, Uncle Scrooge. I've been flying since before Donald could walk.
Scrooge: Agh, fine. You know what you're do...
Della prepares for a rough and wild landing as both Scrooge and Dewey panic until the plane lands safely on the ground without crashing. The back of the plane opens and Scrooge, Della, and Dewey prepare to come out. Scrooge appears dazed out and a bit dizzy before regaining consciousness.
Scrooge: Now, all that stands between me and that contract is...
Flintheart Glomgold: Flintheart Glomgold! [Camera cuts to Flintheart laughing and making dramatic entrance noise with his mouth while turning on a flashlight on his face to appear scary as Zan Owlson follows him] The lightning! [Continues laughing until the flashlight goes dead]
Zan Owlson: [Adamant to Glomgold] I cut his dramatic entrance budget.
Flintheart shakes his flashlight constantly until he unintentionally knocks himself to the ground after trying to tap on the flashlight to get it to work again. Zan face-palms.
(Theme Song plays)
A shot of the facility is seen until it cuts to the inside where Scrooge is giving a presentation to Ludwig's children: Corvus, Anya, and Klara while Glomgold and Owlson wait their turn and Della and Dewey are checking out a map of the vault.
Scrooge: The noble seed, our hope for a better tomorrow. [On the projection, Ludwig is planting and watering seeds until it grows into a tree] Carefully tended, a seed will sprout with promise. That's what your father, Ludwig wanted for you; what any parent wants for their child really. To see them thrive in the face of an uncertain tomorrow. [Ludwig's children burst into tears and cry with joy as the camera slides slowly to the right towards Della and Dewey as they focus their attention on Scrooge and Della pats Dewey's shoulder while Glomgold sleeps, snores, and drools during the presentation] In that vault lies everything the world needs to survive a doomsday scenario: [Showcases what the vault contains] Food, water, shelter, poison darts, vampire antitoxin and... The fabled Money Tree of Oramorus!
Della and Dewey: Ooooh!
Flintheart suddenly wakes up as his eyes widen in excitement.
Flintheart Glomgold: Money Tree?! Owlson, why didn't you tell me there was a Money Tree?!
Zan Owlson: It was one of the several points in the presentation I prepared for you, which I'm now realizing you didn't read. Great.
Scrooge: The Money Tree is the most venerated of vegetation. To gaze upon even its seed is to know the true meaning of wonder. [Della and Dewey appear more excited than ever] I swear to lock them up so tight that nothing will ever touch those seeds until the end of the world!
Over claps, Della and Dewey become upset and disappointed upon learning of Scrooge's intentions. Then, Della nudges Dewey's arm and signals him to just go out and check out the money seeds anyway before Scrooge does otherwise. Della and Dewey exit the room behind Scrooge's back while Ludwig's children applaud Scrooge on his presentation.
The shot cuts to Della and Dewey running down the halls.
Della & Dewey: We've gotta see those Money Tree seeds before Scrooge locks them up forever! Jinx! Double-jinx!
Dewey runs ahead of his mother as she stops.
Della: My son literally running toward adventure. I've never been more proud of this moment.
Dewey stops to look at his mother from a distance with joy. He nods at her. Then, Della continues running as she passes ahead of her son.
Della: Race you to the Cloudslayer!
Cut back to the presentation room. Scrooge turns off the projector and the curtain shuts. Glomgold takes his competitor's place on the podium as the former snaps his fingers at him. He sets up a Glomgold 7 Point Plan.
Flintheart Glomgold: The Doomsday Vault is the key to our future...
Owlson: So far, so good.
Flintheart Glomgold: A future in which I make more money than McDuck, win our bet, and WIN HIS COMPANY! [Crosses out the business plan and flips the board to a blank side] Here's where you come in.
Glomgold scribbles onto the blank side. Cut to the Von Drake children glaring blankly at Scrooge, while Owlson looks on in disbelief. Everyone turns to Glomgold's board again.
Flintheart Glomgold: I break into the vault, [Points to Glomgold breaching the vault doors then to Glomgold carrying a small Money Tree] grab the money tree, [Then to Glomgold splitting the money with the Von drake children] we'll split the profits 90/10, [Then to Glomgold detonating the vault and makes red marks like fire] then I'll blow up the vault to cover our tracks!
The Von Drake children and Owlson gasp in horror then Owlson steps up to the podium.
Zan Owlson: [Chuckles nervously] What he means is, [Flips the board back to the intended beneficial plan] we will respectfully blow your minds with how secure we'll make that vault for half the price.
Corvus: Uh-huh.
Anya, Klara, and Corvus smile at each other, but Glomgold stands on their bench.
Flintheart Glomgold: And if you don't give us the job, I'm just gonna steal the tree anyway! So-o-oo...
Cut to outside the lab. Glomgold is ejected from the lab with a shout and crashes into a snow pile near a sign reading "Von Drake Parking (all others will be vaporized)". Glomgold unburies himself while Owlson backs out of the lab.
Owlson: So sorry, everyone! Deepest apologies. [Disappointed while Scrooge and the owners come out afterwards] I can't believe he lost us another contract...!
Anya: [Shakes Scrooge's hand] Congratulations, Mr. McDuck! You have ze job zere!
Glomgold shakes the snow off himself while Owlson seems angry as she approaches him.
Owlson: No... more... cockamamie ploys!
Glomgold: Cockamamie ploy? That was clearly a maniacal scheme. How long have you worked for me?
Owlson: [Points a finger at her boss] I don't work FOR you; I'm the only one who keeps you from ruining this company with your brainless plots!
Glomgold: [After Owlson through his winter jacket at him] Schemes.
Owlson seethes, groans, and marches off. Scrooge triumphantly watches while a shield generator is in the distance.
Scrooge: Better luck next time, Flinty. See you back in Duckburg.
Scrooge walks away and turns a corner but then gasps seeing the Sunchaser/Cloudslayer is absent.
Scrooge: Uh, where is my plane? And Dewey? And Del- [Becomes worried and annoyed] Oh, no...!
Cut to the Sunchaser/Cloudslayer flying away from the Von Drake labs. Pop music is heard playing.
Dewey and Della: [Singing] So stand out...
Cut to the Sunchaser/Cloudslayer cockpit, where Dewey and Della are singing and dancing. There is also a CD album case of Powerline's Stand Out.
Dewey and Della: [Singing] Above the crowd, even if I gotta shout out loud. 'Til mine is the only face that you'll see, I'm gonna staaaaaaand out, till you notice me! [Music stops]
Della: Nailed it! [Ruffles Dewey's hair]
Dewey: Mom, stop. [Della stops] No, I'm just kidding. Keep going. [Della kisses him instead]
Della: When I was stuck on the Moon, all I thought about was teaching you how to adventure. [Suddenly, she has a worried look on her face] Well, that, and avoiding horrifying Moon monsters. [Shakes her head] But you're already a natural at all of this.
Dewey: Roger dodger, as the crow flies. Co-pilot to pilot, we're a-go for, uh, um, flying, I guess?
Della: Co-pilot? No way. You're pilot material, buddy. Take the stick!
Dewey: Me? Fly the Sunch..., I mean, Cloudslayer? Scrooge won't even let me touch the toaster.
Della: You're my kid. You can do anything.
Dewey: You are the best mom!
Della appears flattered by her son's opinion as Dewey takes control but is struggling to learn how to fly the plane properly until Della kindly comes to his aid.
Della: Now, close your eyes. [Dewey closes his eyes but then re-opens one of them until Della reassures him with a nod] Feel the sky.
Dewey appears to be flying properly as Della watches him and goes back to her seat to relax.
Dewey: I'm doing it. I'm Dewey-ing...
Dewey suddenly loses control and both he and Della panic as the plane comes down and crashes into a cave. Inside the cave, Della climbs out and slides down through a snowy slope. Then, Dewey jumps, lands inside the snow, and rolls out; covered in snow like a snowball.
Dewey: I... am... so sorry.
Della: For what?! That was a perfect first try! [Grabs, spins, and hugs Dewey in happiness as the snow falls off of him] I'm so proud of you, Dewey! [Puts him down as Dewey smiles at this] To adventure!
Della and Dewey continue walking until they reach two tunnels that lead out of the cave. The left tunnel looks straightforward and the right is steep strewn stalagmites and icicles. Della goes to the first tunnel.
Della: So, you wanna do this the easy way... [Goes to the second tunnel] or the "fun" way?
Dewey: I am offended you had to ask.
Cut to the Von Drake labs, two persons are arriving while Scrooge is walking about, speaking to someone on his cellphone.
Scrooge: Easy, Beakley. Della wouldn't just steal an aircraft and set out on a whim. [Scratches the back of his head] Oh, you know, except for that one time. But she's matured, and I'll just- [Someone in an oil drum handcuffs him and he turns to see] What in the blazes?!
Glomgold: [Reveals himself] Aha! Capture Scrooge, force him to get me to the vault, steal the Money Tree! Brilliant scheming, Glomgold.
Glomgold hi-fours his prisoner, but Scrooge tugs on the handcuffs.
Scrooge: [Sighs] Beakley, I'm gonna have to call you back. [Pulls out a radar the yellow dot being the Sunchaser/Cloudslayer and the green dot being the seed vault then turns angrily to Glomgold] Oh, well, seems I'm headed to the vault anyway. Might as well take your plane.
Flintheart: Ooh, Owlson took my plane. I captured you so I can take yours.[Laughs maniacally until Scrooge shows him that his plane is gone then, walks away] Looks like we're walking. [His hand is tugged and grunts]
Scrooge: With no gear, no supplies? You want to march blindly without thinking? Uh... [Glomgold pulls Scrooge back causing his rival to turn to him] I forgot who I was talking to. Let's go back to base camp; [Yanks the shackle] We need to prepare.
Flintheart: [Grabbing the shackle] I know where I'm going!
Glomgold spins Scrooge in a circle, and Scrooge does the same before being pulled forward and bouncing off Glomgold's frontal. As they pull against the shackle on the frozen lake, they don't even notice a sign saying: "Caution, frozen lake. Brought to you by Von Drake." Glomgold pulls Scrooge in a circle and vice versa a few more times until Scrooge pauses.
Scrooge: You're on thin ice, Glomgold.
Flintheart: I don't have to listen to you, McDuck!
Scrooge: No, you are literally on...
The frozen lake crackles beneath Scrooge and his rival and they fall into the water. Camera pulls back while Scrooge and Glomgold come out of the other end with the latter panting, then brushes himself.
Flintheart: All part of the scheme!
Flintheart falls with a panicked shout back into the frozen lake, with a displeased Scrooge following microseconds after.
Cut to the cave, Della and Dewey are whooping and laughing excitedly while sliding down the cave's steep path. Della dodges an ice fragment, then turns around.
Della: Money Tree seed, here we come!
The mother-son duo dodge another ice fragment. They slide out the other end of the cave and jolt from a snowy fragment. Della and Dewey laugh while Della spins.
Dewey: I can't stop laughing!
They stop laughing and gasp; getting their glimpse of the Doomsday Vault, the entrance strewn with icicles. They walk to a crevice and see part of the rock wall falling down.
Dewey: [Off-screen] Pretty weird way to build a bridge.
Della gasps when she sees Dewey staring down the entrance bridge which is split in two as icicles fall. Della walks up to the damaged bridge.
Della: Dewey, honey, I don't think they built it with a big hole in it. [Turns to her son] It must have been torn apart when the ice melted and this crevice widened.
The duo walk back, then gain the momentum to leap over the broken bridge. As they land on the other side, metal creaks while the duo head inside. Suddenly, Della's metallic leg steps through a green security laser and the entrance closes, breaking icicles and making the duo gasp. Ludwig appears on a monitor.
Ludwig: Welcome, survivors! If you're here, the world has ended. So sad. But, congratulations on not being eaten by zombies or hyper-intelligent hairless apes or something like that. [Eccentrically] Now, don't worry, because I, Professor Ludwig Von Drake, have prepared for every possible threat!
An icicle drops and shatters behind the mother-son duo.
Della: [Scoffs] Except climate change apparently. [High-fours Dewey]
Ludwig: Now, then, you are gonna see a [Points to the right] color pad next to the door. [Ludwig walks off the screen, then appears on a monitor above the color pad and points to it two times] I thought the apocalypse might be brought about by werewolves. You know, they're very smart with numbers, but they's extremely [Extends his right eyelid] color-blind. Now, the password is very simple. It's, uh... [He becomes confused] Oy, hold on. Where is that...? [Mutters while checking his pockets and turning his back, before turning to see the Ducks with a chuckle] That's right! [Pulls out a note for the password and sings] Red, yellow, green, red, blue, blue, blue, red, purple, green, yellow, orange, red, red.
Della: [Presses the purple button two times with no effect] Ah, stupid, [Punches the color pad two times in anger] frozen buttons! [Della then walks to the door and grunts while trying to force the door open. Still nothing] Buzz-kill [Bangs the door] barricade! [Crosses her arms in disappointment] This blows chunks!
Dewey checks his surroundings then, spots something by the door.
Dewey: Hey, a vent!
Della: [Inspects the size of the ventilation shaft] Oh, I don't think I could fit through there. [Happily] OH, but you could! Crawl through and let me in!
Dewey: On it! [Dewey walks back and poses. From his point of view, we see the vent and Della setting her hands to give Dewey a boost before Dewey runs to her] Alley-dewp! [Leaps from Della's hands into the vent, climbs in, and gives his mother a spy-like look] See you on the other side. [Happily] Miss you already!
Dewey goes into the vent. Cut to inside the vent with Dewey crawling through.
Dewey: [Singing] Gonna crawl through this vent, gonna make my mom proud! Gonna earn the love I want so Deeeeew-sperately!
Della: [Almost muffled] What was that, honey?
Dewey: [Turns his head] N-Nothing. Nothing. [The vent gives way and Dewey falls out before landing safely. He looks up before singing somewhat quietly] Perfect recovery, no one heard that.
Della: [From her end] Is everything alright? There may be some kind of trigger or electrical panel.
Dewey: [Seeing the panel from his end] Yerp, I got this! [Pulls on part of the panel]
Della: [Off-camera] Whatever you do, don't touch it.
Dewey pulls down part of the panel, then gears grind and the alarm blares. From Della's end, she gasps and sees the ceiling descending towards her.
Della and Dewey: Aw, phooey.
Della: Okay. [Turns to Dewey] Dewey, override the security system!
Dewey: [Panicking] Sure, easy-peasy, lemon squeeze... [Sees loosened wires] Oh, no...!
Ludwig: [Appears on the monitor] Right. If you were smart enough to survive the apocalypse, you should be able to deduce which wire will deactivate the trap. Otherwise, anyone in that room goes [Closes his hands together] squish...! [Dewey groans] Good luck!
Della: [The ceiling is seconds from flattening her] You got this, honey! [Lays on her frontal] You can do anything you put your mind to!
Dewey: [Admonishing himself] Way to go, Dewford. Your first adventure with your mom and you're gonna get her killed! [Electricity crackles from the wires as Dewey shows a determined face] Okay, focus, focus. [Moves his hands towards the wires]
Ludwig: [Again on the monitor] You have the 10, [Della tries to hold back the ceiling with her feet] the nine, [Dewey gives a panicked look over which wire to pull] You got your eight over there. [A spark nearly hits Dewey, while Della presses her hands against the ceiling] Coming up on... seven! [Dewey moves his eyes] Six, five, four...
Dewey: [Holding red and purple wires] Red. No!
Ludwig: ...three...
Dewey: Purple, no! [Next grabs green and blue wires] Chartreuse? [Groans and brushes sweat then grabs the green and yellow wires] Just pick a wire!
Ludwig: [While Della moves her other limbs down, leaving her prosthetic leg on the ceiling] Watch out, now! [Dewey sweats from the stress] Here comes two! Hope you got this figured out because here comes the one.
Della: No rush, honey! You're doin' great!
Ludwig: [As Dewey holds the black wire] One quarter, one eighth.
Dewey: Not helping!
Dewey grabs the wires. Just then, his sweat falls onto the wires, short-circuiting the wires out. The ceiling on Della's end raises back up.
Ludwig: See? Now that wasn't hard at all.
The monitor shuts off and electricity crackles from the wires, making Dewey back up. The shutter doors raise and Della slides under to her son.
Dewey: You're alive? [Hugs his mother] OH, YOU'RE ALIVE!
Della: [Raises her arms] WHOO! I was inches from death, terrified, then [Pushes her arms towards Dewey] boom! You pulled it out at the last second for maximum tension!
Dewey: [Rubs the back of his head] Uh-huh.
Della: [Clasping Dewey's right hand with her left one] What else will Dewey and Della conquer together in the forbidden vault? Yetis? [Moves her fingers on her right hand like a spider] Escaped lab experiments? [Makes a melting face] Bacteria that will strip the very flesh from our bones. Let's FIND OUT!
Dewey: [Less confident] Yeah. Let's Dewey it.
Della and Dewey run further into the vault. Cut to the outside, there are footprints in the snow and the camera moves to show Glomgold and Scrooge arriving at the entrance to the vault almost completely frozen.
Flintheart: [Shivering] I'm freezing me tail feathers off. [Slips and breaks the ice off of Scrooge]
Scrooge: [Curious] What would the kids want in the seed vault, besides the opportunity to inconvenience me? [Marches into the vault and tugs for Glomgold to follow] Ech! The sooner we find them, the sooner I can be rid of you. [The rivals see the broken wires from Dewey's actions] Oh, what the crebbins is this mess? It's gonna cost me thousands to replace these mangled mechanisms! [Sighs] It's fine, as long as they're safe. Let's press forward.
Flintheart: [Shows himself] Hang on. I'm drying off by the fire.
Scrooge: Fire? [Sees that Glomgold lit the panel on fire with shock, and uses his hat to try and smother the flames, leaving a small fire] I cannae turn my back for one second! We gotta move!
Flintheart: Fine! I'll dry off quicker.
Scrooge seethes while Glomgold takes some gasoline. From outside, we hear a loud boom and the two rival ducks coughing and gasping. Cut to the elevator, Della and Dewey enter looking around. Then a railing comes up and the door closes. As the elevator moves, the mother-son duo are startled. On the elevator's monitor, it shows "Mind the gap". Then Ludwig comes in again.
Ludwig: Welcome to my Doomsday Seed Vault...
Dewey: Cool!
Della: Oh, wow!
Ludwig: ...encompassing all the entirety of plant life on this planet, including some very rare and mythological plants. I have treated each and every little seed with my Von Drake Super-growth Formula - patent pending - so you don't starve to death while you're waiting for your crops to grow. [The lift stops and Ludwig shows up on the monitor for the claw arm] It will cause them to grow at immense rates. [Vines move to grab Ludwig] Hey. Hey! [The monitor goes on the fritz, then the professor pushes a vine away] I wouldn't plant them within a mile of each other, for safety reasons.
Dewey and Della walk up to the claw arm and Della presses a green button bringing up "Search..." on the computer screen.
Dewey: So, which one of these boxes are the Money Tree seeds in?
Della types in "Money Tree", then gets a triangle. The triangle and marker on the screen follows the number of boxes from right to left going up.
Della: Right... [The duo step back as the green light marks a box between four super-growth tubes] ...there.
They head back to the claw arm and bring up a screen for the arm. Della moves the joystick.
Della: Boy, it's a good thing we've got this giant arm to help out. [Della moves the arm, but then an alarm buzzes and the claw arm shorts out] Aw, phooey! [Moves the joystick with no effect] Come on! Ya' worthless hunk of junk! [Bangs the panel and hurts her hand] Ow! [Defeated] Sorry, kid. Looks like we came all this way for nothing. So much for our first great adventure together.
Della is surprised to see Dewey is not beside her and looks around to find her son running up the broken claw mechanism.
Dewey: If I don't make it, tell my brothers I was the best one!
Della runs to the end of the platform, while with a yell, Dewey jumps to the boxes and holds on like rockclimbing.
Della: [With slight confidence] Yeah!
The claw arm creaks and lurches forward; breaking a super-growth tube, sending its contents into the pit. The duo see the spilt formula then, Della turns to Dewey.
Della: Okay, just boulder up those lockers like a rock wall. Then, once you have a seed, base-jump back to the platform and... [Sees the heights that her party is in] Wait, is this crazy?
Dewey: Crazy is my middle name!
Della: [As Dewey climbs] Are you sure?
Dewey: No, it's... it's actually Dingus.
Della: [Disgusted] Ew, really? [Worried] No, I mean, it's pretty dangerous. I can do this part if you want.
Dewey: [Turns confidently to Della] Mom, relax. I'm your son. I can Dewey it. I can do anything, just like you told me!
Della: [Nervous chuckle] Of course you can, my little hero!
The two thumbs-up one another and Dewey sees his vision is getting wobbly. He shakes his head and tries to climb but slips. Della gasps in shock, but Dewey grabs hold of a box in time. Dewey swings and gets into the right position for climbing. The mother-son duo thumbs-up one another again before Dewey climbs up to the green glowing box and chuckles.
Dewey: I made it!
Della: Of course you did!
Dewey grunts and peaks into the drawer. Over a golden glow, Dewey gasps while seeing the Money Tree seed up close.
Dewey: So beautiful. So worth it!
Della: [While Dewey turns to gesture her]I knew you could...
But then, the drawer suddenly bends and the seeds fall out of Dewey's reach. Della also fails to catch the seeds as they drop into the pit with the spilt growing formula.
Dewey: Oops.
Suddenly, the building rumbles violently making Della yell. Dewey grunts, trying to swing his feet into place, then, the Money Tree begins to grow at a fast pace starting at golden branches. The mother-son duo scream in horror.
Cut to Scrooge and Glomgold's end where the corridor is now on fire with Scrooge trying to smother the smoke with his hat.
Flintheart: This is all your fault, Scrooge!
Scrooge: [Sets his hat back on his head] You shackled us together! You poured gasoline on the fire with no sense of consequence! What was I supposed to do?!
Flintheart: Make me... not do that?
Ludwig: [Appears again on the monitor as Scrooge turns to see the professor's recording] Oh, I notice the room is on fire. I will activate the sprinklers. [The sprinklers are lowered, but come out frozen]
Scrooge: Blast! Frozen!
Ludwig: And to preserve the seeds of humanity, I will hearby seal off the room!
The rival ducks gasp as the shutter door that Della and Dewey made it through earlier closes back down. Scrooge spots the open hallway and tries run but Glomgold pushes him aside.
Flintheart: Perfect!
Glomgold laughs manically as he runs, but the shackle makes him slip while the other shutter door closes on Glomgold's right foot, trapping him as he screams in pain. Glomgold tries to get free.
Flintheart: Aah! Save me, Scrooge!
Scrooge: [Seething] Okay, calm down. Just need to open the door using the panel, [The panel is useless to him] which the children broke. So, we simply climb out that vent [The vent is also broken while Glomgold tries to lift the shutter off his leg] that has also been compromised by Della and Dewey's senseless actions. [Glomgold holds his hands out and flails on the ground] Or for good reasons, don't want to jump to any conclusions; the most pressing matter is the fire. So, we just need to activate the sprink... [Roars in a rage] CAN YA' NEVER THINK ANYTHING THROUGH, DELLA?! [Huffs and walks to the shutter] It's been over a decade and she's [Lifts the shutter and frees his rival] still the same headstrong kid, jumping blindly into danger or space [Manually lifts the door open] or any other disaster without a thought to the damage she leaves behind!
Flintheart: Whoa. You've got, like, your own whole personal thing going on there.
Scrooge turns Glomgold around, tears a part of his winter jacket off, then loosens part of the circuit box and ties the jacket piece to it. Scrooge lights it on fire and melts the ice from the sprinklers one-by-one, extinguishing the fire. The rival ducks continue walking down the corridor.
Scrooge: Move! [Throws the stick away]
Flintheart: Great. Now I'm cold again.
Cut to the inner vault, Della sees the Money Tree sprouting a multitude of dollar bills. She turns to Dewey.
Della: Dewey, are you okay?
Dewey: [Hanging onto the drawer] I got this, Mom! Totally under control! Do not worry!
Scrooge: Kids! [Rushes in still shackled to Glomgold and looks at the fast-growing Money Tree] Oh, they were after the tree. That makes sense.
Flintheart: [Gasps then angrily to Scrooge] You were running a counter-scheme this whole time! Send your family ahead while you slow down old Glommy, eh? [A branch uproots the lift] That's MY Money Tree!
Scrooge: [Desperately] I don't care about the stupid tree! My family is in danger!
Scrooge tries to run but Glomgold holds him back.
Flintheart: When you abduct me, you can decide what's important!
Glomgold drags Scrooge by the shackle while Della climbs the claw arm's mechanism to encourage her son.
Della: Okay, just get some momentum going, then swing yourself out onto that nearest branch. You can do it!
Dewey tries to grab a branch, but gasps as the drawer is about to loosen. Della clenches her teeth while Dewey's grip is failing.
Dewey: [Frightened, tears form in his eyes] I can't! I can't do it! [Loses his grip and falls] Moooom!
Dewey screams as he continues falling. Luckily, Della runs on the claw and grabs Dewey just in time to save him from falling to his death.
Della: I got you. [Dewey looks at his mother] I've always got you.
Debris begins to rain down from above while Glomgold obtains some of the growing dollar bills from the tree.
Flintheart: Gimme that! And that! [Stops Scrooge from leaving] Hey, no touching!
The mother-son duo exchange glances while debris rains down, startling them. The ceiling breaks off and parts of it hit the claw arm, catapulting them with yells to Scrooge and Glomgold, loosening the shackle.
Scrooge: [Checks his wrist] Ah, that's better. [Turns angrily towards Della and Dewey] And you two!
Della: [Holds her fingers together innocently as she and Dewey get off the claw and walk away] Uncle Scrooge, I can explain. [Sees the lift gone as more branches grow]
Scrooge: [Reprimanding] Explain what?! That you stole my plane, put us all in danger, oh, and destroyed humanity's only hope for surviving the end of the world?! Did you ever think of how you were gonna get out of this?! Hmm?!
Della: [Sees that the tree has traction] Simple, we jump.
Scrooge: Oh, no, you don't! No more jumping headfirst into...
Della: [Clasps Scrooge's hands] Trust me. [Turns to Dewey with confidence] We can do this. I got you. [Dewey takes Della's left hand and Glomgold tries to take Scrooge's hand, but Della runs ahead with her family] Now!
Glomgold gasps while the family jump off the platform. Glomgold flips over the railing and falls. While the family slides down the Money Tree branches, Glomgold yells while falling. Dewey sees how amazing his mother is, then shows a crestfallen face. The family makes their way safely to the bottom while Glomgold lands hard.
Della: [To Scrooge] I thought we'd leave through here. [Camera shows an emergency exit]
Scrooge: How did you...?
Della: What? You gave a whole big presentation with a map. I paid attention. When you're stuck in space for 10 years, you pay attention to exit strategies.
Glomgold raises himself and Scrooge gasps. The group heads for the door. Cut to outside on a small bridge, the door bursts outward, then the group jumps out, leaving a branch to block the doorway. Della gasps in shock when she sees Dewey laying face to the floor. She runs to Dewey as he gets up.
Della: Dewey!
Dewey: [Cries a little] I'm sorry, Mom. I let you down. I'm not the adventurer you hoped I'd be.
Della: [Puts her hands around Dewey's face with passion] No, honey. I will always believe you can do anything, but you never have to prove anything to me.
Della and Dewey hug each other. Cut to Scrooge putting his hand and tapping his fingers on a branch.
Scrooge: [Sighs] How am I gonna fix this?
Flintheart: [Gloating] You cannae! You failed, McDuck! Now the Von Drakes are going to fire you, give me the job, and then,...
Della: [Pushes Glomgold aside] I may have a way out of this mess. [Sets her right hand under her beak as if getting some ideas]
The Money Tree grows to a massive size. Sometime later, the vault is being repaired by gold. The entrance bridge is also repaired while trucks collect some of the money and golden branches from the tree. Della is welding some gold and lifts her helmet.
Della: Learned a lot about welding gold on the Moon.
Scrooge: It's a right bonny bin. And since the gold came from the Money Tree, you saved me millions in construction costs.
Dewey: And [Takes some of the Money Tree seeds out of his pockets] we harvested enough seeds to double what they had in... [Gasps while dropping the seeds and gives them to his mother instead] I'm just gonna let someone else put these seeds back.
The Ducks do not notice a spy-cam drone in Glomgold's image spying on them.
Flintheart: But whose got all the money? Glomgold does! Prepare to lose our bet AND your company! [Laughs maniacally while taking out some money he picked from the Money Tree until a gentle breeze blows it further away from his hand and satchel] Nooo! Curse you, gentle breeeeze!
The ice under Glomgold suddenly breaks and Glomgold falls into the water. Then, the spy-cam drone falls in as well and electrocutes him as he screams in pain.
