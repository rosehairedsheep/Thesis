{The dark sky shimmers with muted shades of purple and smaller planets orbit the planet, Etheria. Beyond the flowery meadows of Etheria, a city rises out of a patch of scorched earth and an outcropping of jagged rocks. Raised roadways and ghoulish robotic structures surround the city landscape. A young woman cinches the belt around her waist and dawns a pair of boots. She pulls her hair back in a ponytail and her armband glows. She boxes a punching bag and brushes her teeth. She salutes the mirror.}
Adora: [Grunting] [Mimics Gunshots] [Grunting]. 
[She leers at a picture of an evil figure on her punching bag.]
Adora: Hey, princess, you looking at me? [Shouts]
{She kicks the bag.}
Woman over PA: All squadrons, report to training area immediately for evaluation.

{Soon after, she takes her place beside 3 more recruits.}
Adora: [Whispers] Psst. Anyone seen Catra?
Lonnie: [Mumbles]
Adora: [Scoffs] Not again.
Unknown Blue Horde Member ((**possibly Commander Cobalt, but not confirmed**)): At attention, cadets. Your simulation is about to begin. Here's your scenario. You'll be passing through the treacherous Whispering Woods to reach the heart of the rebel insurgency, Bright Moon.
Kyle: [Whimpers]
Unknown Blue Horde Member: Your mission is to defeat the Queen of the Princesses and liberate Bright Moon in Lord Hordak's name. Where's Catra?
Adora: She will be here. I promise.
Unknown Blue Horde Member: Mm-hmm. The Whispering Woods is full of princesses.  Vicious, violent instigators. They will take you out if given the chance. Don't give it to them. Good luck, recruits.

[They head into a training arena and a purple princess appears overhead.]
Adora: Watch out!
Kyle: Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
[Shouting]
[The princess fires as the recruits dash into the arena. Adora hurls an explosive.]
Adora: Come on, this way.
[The recruits run and Catra watches from above.]
Catra: [Growls]
[Kyle is hit. His teammates return to him. His suit is sizzling and an X appears on the plate.]
Kyle: [Screams] Aw, dang it.
Adora: Seriously, Kyle?
Lonnie: Bra-vo.
{Kyle frowns. Three princesses hover over them.}
[Gunshots]
Lonnie: Seriously, Kyle?
Adora: Run!
{The recruits hold shields over their head as the princesses fire. Adora sprints ahead.}
Lonnie: Adora!
[Alarm Beeping]
{Red hexagons glow red under Adora's feet and a robotic orb shoots up from the floor. The orb morphs into a four legged robot. Adora runs at the robot with a saber. She pulls herself onto the robot's head and bashes its guns with her saber.}
Adora: [Gasps] [Yells]
[Alarm Beeping]
{Adora smashes the robot and it sinks into the floor. She leaps off and flops onto the floor face-down. Catra strides past her and pushes the crackling robot into the floor. Adora raises her head and Catra points at the red symbol beneath her. Adora falls in.}
Adora: [Yells]
Catra: Hey, Adora. How's it hanging?
Adora: Catra. Did you really show up late and let us do all the hard parts? That is low, even for you.
Catra: Aw. You know nothing's too low for me. [Laughing]. Now come on, you look stupid hanging down there.
Woman over PA: Training exercise successfully completed.
Catra: [Laughing].  You should've seen your face. You were like, "Aah, no! Betrayal."
Adora: [Scoffs] Come on, Catra. We're senior cadets now. I can't believe you're still pulling such childish, immature-- Is that a mouse?!
Catra: What!? Where!?
Adora: [Laughing]. Are you ever going to not fall for that?
Catra: I don't know. Are you ever going to let it go? That was one time.
Adora: I know, but for some reason it's always funny. 
Shadow Weaver: Adora.
{Shadow Weaver approaches.}
Adora: Shadow Weaver.
Shadow Weaver: You have done well. You've completed your training course in record time.
Adora: Uh, well, that wasn't just me. You know, Catra did, too.
Shadow Weaver: Ah, yes. How someone as unmotivated as you completed the course in that time, I'll never know.
Catra: Always serving up those pep talks, huh, Shadow Weaver?
Shadow Weaver: Silence. Do not be flippant with me, cadet.
Catra: Sorry Shadow Weaver.
Shadow Weaver: Adora, walk with me.
{Adora looks at Catra and she shrugs.}
Shadow Weaver: Adora.
{She runs after Shadow Weaver.}

Scene change
Shadow Weaver: Lord Hordak has been watching you. He thinks you are a fine candidate for Force Captain.
Adora: Really? Force Captain? Lord Hordak said that about me?
Shadow Weaver: Oh yes. He sees great promise in you. In fact, he has elected you the honor of leading a squadron in the invasion of the rebel Fortress of Thaymor. 
Adora: Thaymor? You mean we're finally seeing active duty? 
Shadow Weaver: You are seeing active duty.
Adora: But I'll be able to bring my team along, right?
Shadow Weaver: Your team is not ready. They'll only slow you down.
Adora: Shadow Weaver, with respect, they've been training hard for this, too. And Catra, all she wants is to get out there and prove herself.
Shadow Weaver: Then she should have worked harder to prove herself to me. This is what I raised you for, Adora. Now is your chance to prove yourself.
{Adora takes the Force Captain badge.}
Shadow Weaver: I saw talent in you the moment I found you as an orphan child and took you in. Is this not what you've wanted since you were old enough to want anything?
Adora: Yes.
Shadow Weaver: With you at the forefront, we will crush the Bright Moon Rebellion once and for all. Do not disappoint me.
{Adora gazes out the window.}

Scene change
{Meanwhile, a white castle is perched on a mountain beside a blue lake.}
Angella: Send her in.
{Flight by guards, a young woman enters a royal hall and approaches a woman sitting on a throne. She kneels.}
Glimmer: Your Majesty.
Angella: I'm told you disobeyed orders and led the Rebellion into a dangerous combat situation after you were ordered to retreat.
Glimmer: I was trying to protect a village from falling into The Horde's grasp.
Angella: You were reckless and put yourself and the other rebels in danger.
Glimmer: Fighting is supposed to be dangerous! How are we going to hold our own against The Horde if we keep retreating? Pretty soon, we won't have anything left to defend.
Angella: I'm growing tired of your back-talking, Commander Glimmer.
Glimmer: Why did you even make me a commander if you won't let me fight?
Angella: That's enough! You're grounded!
Glimmer: [Scoffs] Mom!
Angella: You heard me!
Glimmer: You never let me do anything!
Angella: We are not having this discussion tonight. You are embarrassing me in front of my royal court.
Glimmer: Oh, I'm embarrassing you?
Angella: Go to your room!
Glimmer: I'm going!
{Glimmer storms out.}
Angella: [Sighs]
{Angella frowns.}

Scene change
{Meanwhile, Adora gazes over the dark city. She pulls the badge from her pocket and pins it to her jacket. Catra leaps on her.}
Adora: [Grunts]
Catra: What'd she say? Hey, what's this?
Adora: Hey! Give it back.
{Catra swipes the badge.}
Catra: No way. You've been promoted?
Adora: Well, kind of. I mean, yeah, I guess. Heh. But it's not a big deal.
Catra: Are you kidding? That is awesome. We're gonna see the world and conquer it. Adora, I need to blow something up. [Purring]
Adora: Umm..
Catra: What?
Adora: Shadow Weaver says you're not coming.
Catra: What? My time was just as good as yours today. What is her problem with me?
Adora: I mean, you are kind of disrespectful.
Catra: Why should I respect her? She's just bitter that she doesn't have any real power that doesn't come from Hordak and everyone knows it. I guess it sure must be easy being a people pleaser like you.
Adora: I am not a pe-- Catra, wait. [Sighs]
{Catra scurries off. Adora frowns, then chases after her.}

Scene change
{Catra sits alone on a rooftop. Adora propels over the side of the structure and joins her. 
Adora: Look, I'm sorry. I didn't even think you wanted to be a Force Captain.
Catra: I don't. Here, take your stupid badge.
Adora: Come on, Catra. This is what I have been working for my entire life. I was hoping you could be, I don't know, happy for me.
Catra: Ugh, whatever. It's not like I even care. I just wanna get out of this dump at some point before I die of boredom. I wonder what's even outside the Fright Zone anyway.
Adora: Why don't we go find out?
{Adora has a key.}

Scene change
Catra: I take it all back. You're officially awesome. I can't believe you actually stole a skiff.
Adora: Borrowed. Please don't make me regret this.
Catra: I've always wanted to drive one of these things. Here, gimme.
Adora: Whoa, there. Save us enough fuel to get back.
Catra: That's a problem for future Adora and Catra.
Catra and Adora: I'm driving. I want it.
Catra: Can't have it! [Screams]
[Both shouting]
Catra: Let me.
Adora: Give me. I'm doing it.
Catra: Adora. I want it.
Adora: No, I've got it.
[Shouting]
Adora: Catra!
{They stop the skiff at the edge of a dark forest.}

Scene change
Catra: What is it?
Adora: I think this must be the Whispering Woods. They say there are strange, old monsters in there, an- and the trees move when you're not looking. Every Horde squadron they've sent in there has never come out again.
Catra: Let's go in.
Adora: Wait, what? [Yells]
Catra: Woo-hoo! [Shouting] [Laughs]
{Catra takes the control and they enter the woods. They veer around the winding trunks of towering trees.}
[Both screaming]
Adora: Catra, slow down! Catra, tree! Tree! [Grunts]
{Adora takes control and they fly up. A vine catches her neck and she falls backwards. 
Catra: Adora!
Adora: [Yells] [Grunts]
{Adora falls and crashes face first on the ground. A small glowing white orb floats over her. She rouses.}

Scene change
[Whispers]
Adora: Catra? Huh?
{A spotlight shines on a sword, entangled in vines in a clearing.}
Adora: Whoa. 
{Adora stands and walks towards it.}
Adora: Cool.
{She touches the handle and a light shines.}
[Flashing light]
Adora: [Gasps]
Female voice: Balance must be restored. Etheria must seek a hero.
[Baby crying]
Female voice: Adora, Adora.
Catra: Hey, Adora? Adora!
Adora: Catra? What happened?
Catra: You fell out of the skiff after you drove it into a tree.
Adora: No, you drove it into a tree.
Catra: Ah, up for debate. Come on, let's go.
Adora: Wait. Where is it? Where'd it go?
Catra: What?
Adora: Ther- There was a sword. It was right here. I tried to touch it, but it got really bright.
Catra: Are you brain damaged? Don't be brain damaged. Oh, Shadow Weaver's gonna kill me.
Adora: I'm not brain damaged. It was here, I saw it.
Catra: Well, there's nothing here now. So, come on, let's go.
{Catra pulls Adora by her ponytail and they return to the skiff. Catra drives out of the forest and Adora glances back at the empty clearing. 

Scene change
Glimmer: "Dear Mom, I know you'll never read this, but I have to say it somewhere. I feel like you... don't respect me.
{A figure aims a bow and shoots an arrow at Glimmer's window.}
Glimmer: [Shrieks] 
{A note adorned with hearts reads, "Look Outside!"}
Glimmer: [Groans] 
{She looks out.}
Glimmer: Watch it! You almost hit me!
Bow: Hey, Glimmer.
Glimmer: Shh! Bow, what are you doing here?
Bow: What did you say? Come down here.
Glimmer: I can't, I'm grounded.
Bow: What?
Glimmer: I'm grounded.
Bow: ...What?
Glimmer: I'm... grounded.
{She transports Bow to her room.}
Bow: [Shouts]
Glimmer: [Sighs] I'm so mad at my mom.
Bow: Is this about the siege on Elberon?
Glimmer: I was just trying to defend another one our villages from falling into The Horde's Clutches. She stationed me all the way out here because it's too remote to ever get attacked, but then it did, and it was my one chance to prove that I can do this. But she acts like I can't do anything because I'm just a princess. [Grumbles]
Bow: That doesn't make any sense. Everyone here is a princess. I'm, like, the only one who's not a princess.
Glimmer: [Groans] Tell that to my mom.
Bow: Hey, where does this go?
Glimmer: Bottom drawer.
Bow: Anyway, your mom might have a point. Only reason you got out of there is because of your teleportation powers, and, let's face it, they don't always work that well.
Glimmer: Looking for support here, Bow!
Bow: I'm just saying, if you wanna prove yourself, it's gonna take more than running recklessly into any old battle. Luckily, I've got just the thing. Check this out. I detected a piece of First Ones tech in the Whispering Woods. A pretty powerful one, too, by the size of these readings. If you find this one and bring it back, your mom is bound to be impressed.
Glimmer: Did you forget I'm grounded?
[Knocking on door]
Angella: Glimmer? Are you in there?
{She returns Bow to the forest.}
Glimmer: Uh...
Bow: Ah!
Angella: Glimmer?
Glimmer: Everything's fine, Mom.
Angella: Is someone else in there? I heard voices.
Glimmer: No one else is in here. Can you please just leave me alone?
Angella: I don't appreciate your tone right now, young lady.
Glimmer: What tone?
Angella: That attitude of yours is never gonna help you know.
Glimmer: Mom, you always tell me what to do-
Angella: You cannot act that way!
Glimmer: -And that's not fair!
[Door slams]
{Glimmer joins Bow.}
Glimmer: I'm in.

Scene change
{Meanwhile, Catra sleeps at the foot of Adora's bunk in the Horde barracks. Adora tosses and turns.}
Adora: [Grunts]
Female Voice: Adora. Adora. Adora!
Adora: [Gasps]
{Adora jolts up and looks around. She smiles at Catra sleeping, then gently eases herself out of bed. Catra opens one eye as she walks away. Adora exits the room and Catra appears.}
Catra: Hey, where are you going?
Adora: Back to the woods. There's something I need to figure out.
Catra: What? You're not--
{She covers Catra's mouth as a robot passes.}
[Robot Beeping]
Catra: What is wrong with you? You've been acting weird since we got back. Are you sure you're not brain damaged?
Adora: Look Catra, I know I saw something out there. It's ju- I just need to get another look. It feels important somehow.
Catra: Sounds good. Let's go.
Adora: No. I don't want you getting in trouble on my behalf. Just cover for me okay? I'll be back before anyone knows I'm gone.
Catra: Adora! Adora!

Scene change
Bow: Come on! Come on!
Glimmer: Uh! Please tell me we're not lost!
Bow: No, this thing is just acting up. Looks like it's being overloaded by the tech's signal. We must be getting close!
Glimmer: Uhh... I think it's that way.
Bow: What makes you say that? 
{Glimmer points at a light.}
Bow: Oh, yeah. That'll do it.
{Adora enters the forest.}
Adora: What are you doing out here, Adora? Catra's right, this is crazy. There's no sword, you just got hit on the head a little too hard. You should just go back home and forget about all of this.
{She spots the glowing light and approaches. Moments later, Adora separates dense bushes and spots an illuminescent sword in the clearing.}
Glimmer: Bow, just let me lead the way, okay?
Bow: The light came from the edge of the forest.

Glimmer: Yes, you saw the light. It's this way.    the Sword of Protection  
Bow: The trackpad says otherwise.
Glimmer: It's this way--
{Glimmer spies Adora.}
Bow and Glimmer: [Gasps]
Adora: [Gasps]
Glimmer: Horde soldier!
Bow: I see her!
Bow and Glimmer: [Yelling]
Adora: [Gasps] [Grunting]
{Adora runs towards the sword and Glimmer vanishes. She reappears with the sword.} 
Glimmer: Bow, catch.
{Glimmer tosses the sword to Bow.}
Adora: Give me the sword.
[Yelling]
{Glimmer jumps on Adora's back. She flings her off, then spins a weapon.}
Adora: Get off. Stand down. I don't wanna hurt you.
Glimmer: Since when do Horde soldiers not want to hurt anyone?
{Glimmer explodes a glitter bomb in Adora's face and reaches for the sword. Adora leaps on top of her. Bow jumps on top of the women and they tussle on the ground. Adora reaches out and touches the sword. A light emanates from the weapon.}
[All Grunting and shouting]
Adora: What?
{Sparkles appear.}
Female voice: Hello, Adora.
Adora: Who are you? What's going on?
Female voice: My name is Light Hope. I have been waiting a long time for you, but I could not reach you until you forged your connection with the sword.
Adora: You sent the sword?
Light Hope: The sword is meant for you. Etheria has need of you, Adora. Will you answer its call? Will you fight for the honor of Grayskull?
Adora: What are you talking about? What-- What is-- What's Grayskull? You're not making any sense! I don't understand!
Light Hope: You will.
Adora: Wait!
[Grunts]
{Light Hope vanishes and Adora is blown backwards. She opens her eyes and her wrists are bound.}
Adora: [Groaning]
Bow: Hey! She's awake.
Adora: What happened?
Glimmer: Quiet, Horde spy, I ask the questions. How did you make it this far into the Whispering Woods?
Adora: I just walked in. And I'm not a spy.
Glimmer: Sure, sure. You just so happened to find yourself in the Whispering Woods, like you just so happened to try and steal our sword.
Adora: It's not yours. I found it first.
Glimmer: The Whispering Woods is under the Rebellion's protection. You were lucky to make it as far as you did. Come on, Bow. Let's get this spy back to Bright Moon where she can be interrogated properly. This is perfect. Not only do we First Ones tech for the rebellion, we've also captured a Horde spy. My mom's gonna be so impressed. Now come on, on your feet.

Scene change
Bow: You positive we're going the right way, Glimmer?
Glimmer: I know what I'm doing, Bow. Can you please just trust me for once?
Bow: You know I always trust you, but I'm starting to get a little freaked out. I mean, I pretty much grew up in these woods and I've never even seen this part of them. I've heard stories about weird stuff out here.
Glimmer: It's fine, okay? Just let me figure this out.
Bow: Okay! Touchy. Sorry about her. Usually she's really nice. Not much for talking, huh?
Adora: I prefer not to swap pleasantries with my captors.
Bow: Fair. Suit yourself.
{Glimmer teleports herself and Adora turns to Bow.}
Adora: You know she's a princess, right? How can you follow her? Princesses are a dangerous threat to everyone on Etheria.
Bow: Is that what Hordak told you?
Adora: Well I thought it was just common knowledge. They're violent instigators who don't even know how to control their powers.
Glimmer: [Shouting]
Bow: You've never actually met a princess, have you?
Adora: [Huff] Well, maybe not in person, but...
Glimmer: [Whimpering]
{They run to Glimmer. She stands before the ruins of a forest dwelling. Glimmer bends to pick up a cracked drawing of a young child, holding the hands of an adult.}
Adora: What happened to this place?
Glimmer: Don't play dumb with me. I bet you were part of the raiding party that did this.
Adora: What are you talking about? The Horde didn't do this.
{Glimmer drags Adora to a Horde robot crashed on the ground.}
Glimmer: Oh yeah? You're a heartless destroyer, just like all the rest of your people.
Adora: I'm not a destroyer. Hordak says we're doing what's best for Etheria. We're trying to make things better. More orderly.
Glimmer: This is what's best for Etheria? Ever since The Horde got here, they've been poisoning our land, burning our cities, destroying everything in their path. And you're a part of it! How's that for orderly?
{Glimmer strides angrily ahead and Adora blinks.}
Adora: This doesn't make any sense. The Horde would never do something like this.
Bow: Did you really not know any of this? I mean, your army is called the Evil Horde.
Adora: Who calls us that?
Bow: ...Everybody!
Adora: The Horde rescued me when I was a baby and gave me a home. They're my family. You-- you don't know them like I do.
Bow: Maybe you don't know them like you think you do.
Glimmer: [Shouting] There's something out there. Something big.
Bow: How big?
[Ground Rumbling] [Grunts]
{A giant insect-like creature pops out of the earth.}
Bow: So, pretty big then.
[Screeching]
{It extends six-clawed legs.}
Bow: Watch out!
{Glimmer leaps onto the bug's head and it tosses her backwards. Adora's foot gets stuck in a crack in the ground. The beast turns to her and she tugs on her trapped foot. Bow shoots an arrow and a web covers the creature's mouth.}
[Grunting and Shouting]
Glimmer: [Yelling]
[Screech]
Glimmer: [Yelling]
{Glimmer throws a series of glitter bombs at the creature and it whacks her into a tree. She slumps on the ground and Bow aims an arrow. Adora frees her foot. The beast flings Bow into a tree trunk and Adora looks at the sword. Glimmer kneels and shoots glitter bombs as the beast draws near. The sword crackles with electricity in Adora's hand.}
Adora: Hey, bug brain! Come on, Magic Sword. Oh, where's a blinding flash of light when you need one? [Screams]
{The beast charges toward her and she fumbles the sword. Adora picks it up and lifts it above her head. A flashing beam of light radiates from the blade.}
Light Hope: Adora. Adora. Adora.
[Baby Crying]
Light Hope: Will you fight for the honor of Grayskull?
[Echoing]: .. honor of Grayskull?
Adora: For the honor of Grayskull!
{Glimmer and Bow shield their eyes as the light glows around them. The beast kneels. Adora has transformed into a warrior princess with flowing long hair.}
