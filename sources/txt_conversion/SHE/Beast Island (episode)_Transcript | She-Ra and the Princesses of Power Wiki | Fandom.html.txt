[Lightning strikes]
Swift Wind: Are you sure we're going the right way? Like, 100 percent sure?
Adora: [Sigh] For the last time, I don't know. We have to trust that the navigation system knows what it's doing. Now stop asking.
Bow: We've got to be close. Any minute now. Beast Island is around here. Somewhere.
Adora: We will find it. [Sigh] We have to.
Bow: Do you think Glimmer will still be upset when we get back? We did sort of, kind of, completely disobey direct orders
Adora: She'll understand. We all want what's best for Etheria. And once we get Entrapta back, Glimmer will know we made the right decision.
Bow: Right, but—I mean what if she doesn't? What if she never talks to me again?
[Alarm beeps]
Adora: Uh, Bow? The thing that's blinking, should it be blinking?
Bow: Uhh, I don't know, a ship?
Swift Wind: Uh, guys, I'm sensing something out there. Something big, and it's not good. And I think I hear—

[All Shout] [The ship's alarms start going off]

Bow: Don't panic, no one panic. [Groans]
[Brief Pause]
Bow: Uh, nope! Never mind, Panic!

[All Shout, gradually dying down as they descend into the water]

Swift Wind: Ehh
Adora: Look. It's Beast Island.

[Intro Theme]

Adora: As kids, we were warned of the dangers of Beast Island. There were the Chibbits with razor-sharp teeth, Scruffers with razor-sharp horns, Razorfins with—
Bow: Razor-sharp fins?!
Adora: Razor-sharp teeth, actually. I don't know why it had that name
Swift Wind: Adora! [Sniffs scrap metal] [Bug crawling noises] Okay! That's normal.
Adora: [Gasps] Entrapta. She must have been on it.
Swift Wind: Where do you think she went?

[Droning Noise]

Swift Wind: What is that noise?
Bow: What noise?
Swift Wind: [Grunts] It's gone [Grunts again] You didn't hear it?
Bow: Uh, any scary Horde bedtime stories about noises only horses can hear?
Adora: Not that I can remember.
Swift Wind: I heard the same sound earlier, right before Mara's ship crashed.
Bow: First Ones' tech. This is all First Ones' tech. But it's corrupted, melted down. This must've been some kind of First Ones' dumping ground
Adora: We should get moving while we still have light. Entrapta's here somewhere.
[Creature roars distantly]
Swift Wind: [sung] On this awful nightmare island, [Adora groans] which we went to on purpose, so everything's great. Hey, let's take a fun stroll through nightmare island, just kidding, it's definitely not weird and scary. [creatures chittering] I wanna go home.
[Chittering creatures stop]
Swift Wind: Maybe everything went quiet... for a good reason.
[Creature growls]
Adora: Nope, a bad reason.
Bow: Okay, no one move. Maybe it won't see us.
[Clanging of metal creature] [Everyone shouting]
Adora: For the honor of Grayskull!
[Spark noises emit from the sword]
Adora: [gasps]
Bow: Uh... Adora?
Adora: Run!
[Metal creature screeching]
[Swift Wind falls and grunts]
Bow: What happened? Why can't you be She-Ra?
Adora: I don't know!
[Droning Sound]
Swift Wind: There it is again, that sound.
[Droning Sound]
Swift Wind: Really, no one else hears that?
[Adora gasps upon seeing the monster, then Bow] [All shouting]
Adora: No! Come on, come on. For the honor of Grayskull! [Shouts, then grunts]
Bow: Adora!
[Another man jumps into the frame. He has a cloak and long, grey-brown hair with a beard]
Man: [Grunts and shouts while fighting]
Bow: Woah.
Adora: Who is that guy? Thank you, you saved us. Who—?
Bow: [Gasps] King Micah.
[in the Crystal Castle]
Glimmer: Light Hope? [Clears Throat] The queen of Bright Moon demands to speak to Light Hope. Now. [silence] On behalf of the Great Rebellion, I need you to answer my questions. [Silence] Eternia? Okay I know you can hear me. [silence] So that's how it is. Fine. I'll just have to make you listen. [Slams down staff]
Light Hope: [Intercom] Unauthorized presence detected. Security protocol activated.
[Spiders screech]
Glimmer: You're not getting rid of me that easily.
[On Beast Island]
Adora: Your Majesty
Man/King Micah: Huh? You know who I am? Please don't kneel. I'm no king here.
Adora: Of course we know. Oh, uh I'm Adora, and this is Swift Wind and Bow.
Bow: King Micah, It's so great to— [King Micah grabs Bow's face] —meet you.
King Micah: Huh. Apologies. It's been... quite some time since I've talked to anyone else. Anyone real, that is. And you are real, Right?!
Bow: Very real. Huh, yeah. Hi. Uh... Are you real? I mean, we kinda thought you were dead.
Micah: If the horde had their way, I would be. They exiled me here, but I survived!
Adora: King Micah, we're from Bright Moon. We know your daughter, Glimmer.
Micah: My sweet Glimmer? Huh? [Creature noises] There's no time for pleasantries! We have to move quick, follow me!
[Micah uses sorcery to make the group safe]
Bow: Woah.
Micah: We should be able to rest here for a moment. A safe, quiet mo—
[Micah dives to the ground] [All shout]
Micah: Gotcha! Oh— I'm so sorry. Where are my manners? Bug?
Adora: Uh, mmh. No.
Bow: [whines and moves away]
Micah: [Easts the bug] So, what brings you to Beast Island?
Adora: Uh, We came here looking for our friend, Princess Entrapta. Any chance you've seen her? She's got purple hair and really like robots. Like, realy, really likes robots.
Micah: Yeah, I know her. She stole my rations. Only the tiny ones for some reason.

Adora: That's great! I mean, not the food part, but the other part. She's okay, or she was not long ago.
Swift Wind: Did you see which way she went?
Micah: Why yes, sh— Is that horse talking?!
Swift Wind: I can hear you. I'm swift wind, and I—
Micah: It has wings!
Swift Wind: Well, this is definitely Glimmer's dad.
Bow: Your Majesty, could you let me go?
Micah: Huh? Oh, right. [Chuckles] Sorry. Like I said, it's been a little while since I've talked to people, or horses. Because horses talk now, and that's normal.
Adora: You were saying something about Entrapta. Do you know where she is?
Micah: Yes. Your friend headed straight for the center of the island before I could stop her.
Bow: Sounds like Entrapta. Could you point us in the direction—
Micah: You can't go there! You'd never come back. It's where the signal is the strongest.
Swift Wind: The signal. That must be the noise I've been hearing. What is it?
     Micah: You've heard it? Then we have to hurry. This place is a mass of ancient tech, mostly degraded but some of it still works. And something at the center of that island never stopped signaling. The signal dulls your resolve, exposes your vulnerabilities, it pulls you in. Everything that stays on Beast Island becomes a part of it eventually.
Bow: Why can't Adora and I hear it?
Micah: Stay here long enough, and you will. I've heard it every day, for months, years. I have no sense of time here. But I fight it! Nothing ill stop me from getting off this island and reuniting with my family. But enough about me. Tell me news of the Rebellion and Bright Moon. And my baby girl. You know her?
Adora: Glimmer? Sure. She's... Well, she's—
Bow: She's our best friend. We're the Best Friend Squad.
Micah: Sounds like my baby girl. Hm. Always in a hurry to grow up and be friends with the older kids. What about Angella? Have you seen her?
Adora: Your Majesty, I—
[Creature screeching]
Bow: What is that?
Micah: We should keep moving. I'll help you find your friend, and then, can you help me escape this place?
Bow: Of course. We'll all get out of here together.
Micah: Then why are we waiting? Follow me!
[all start following Micah] [Bow sees a creature and screams]
Micah: So you're telling me that horses are now allowed in the War Room, and they all get chairs?
Swift Wind: Big, important chairs, yep! And also, unlimited sugar cubes.
Micah: Eh, sounds good to me. [Kills bug]
Adora: I can't believe Glimmer's dad has been alive this whole time. And he's so cool. A Little weird, but I guess that's to be expected after all this time alone.
Bow: Glimmer will be so happy to see her dad again. She'll have to forgive us for going against her orders, escaping Bright Moon, and taking Mara's ship. Not that we technically did anything wrong, or need to be forgiven. I mean, Glimmer kept us in the dark. The truth is she hasn't been a good friend. But have we been? Can you even have a fight with a best friend and still be best friends? And don't get me started on Shadow Weaver. [Short pause] Are you okay?
Adora: [Sigh] Yeah, it's just— Why can't I be She-Ra here? What if something on this island infected the sword, or what if Glimmer is right an-an-and all I do is ruin everything? I... I just feel useless.
Bow: Hey, you aren't useless. We'll figure this out. You're still a hero, I'm still a tech master, Swift Wind's still—
Swift Wind: Woo-hoo! [Shouts] That's not food!
Bow: He's still a horse. But now we've got Cool Sorcerer Dad helping us.
Adora: You're right.
[At the Crystal Castle]
Glimmer: Are you gonna send more spiders for me to destroy, or are you gonna talk to me? The First Ones stole the magic of Etheria, the magic of my people. Please, talk to me! That magic is how I stop this war. It's how I save everyone. That magic, the magic at the Heart of Etheria... I want to use it.
Light Hope: [Intercom] Temporary administrator access granted to Queen Glimmer of Bright Moon. Queen Glimmer, proceed.
[A door slides open nearby; Glimmer smiles and taps her staff lightly against the metal floor, walking through the now-open doorway]

New scene
[Beast Island, jungle]
[The squad walk through the jungle, the signal droning on; Swift Wind hangs his head in exhaustion]
Swift Wind: [strained] The signal...it's getting... stronger...
[Bow pats Swift Wind in a comforting motion]
Micah: [holding an ear and wincing] We're getting closer. Don't let it distract you. [Adora swats away vines and more fall to hang over their heads, making Bow duck] Tell me... what is she like, my Glimmer?
Bow: [frustrated] Stubborn. Real stubborn.
Adora: [Micah looks back at Bow questioningly; scoffs] Bow.
Bow: What?
Adora: [to Micah; reassuring] She's also brave! She's one of the bravest people I know. [uncertainly, quietly] I just--wanna be the hero she deserves, and I... I don't know if I have been.
Micah: [half chuckling, mirthfully] Great, great. Oh, and does she still have her favorite stuffed animal? The one I made for her--Kowl?
[He hops down off a downed tree, waiting for Adora to follow] 
Adora: Oh, yeah. She's even started to use your sorcerer staff.
Micah: [uncertainly] I-i--isn't that kind of dangerous for a little...kid?
Bow: [scoffs] Try telling her that. Not like she listens to anyone these days, that is except for Sha--
[Micah stops and holds up his hand to silence Bow, listening as animals make chittering noises in the jungle]
Bow: [whispers] What is that?
Micah: [squats with the rest of them; in a low tone] It's the pookas.
Bow: [gasps] Pookas? That sounds adorable! [Adora looks back at him and vehemently shakes her head negatively] Let me guess, more razor-sharp scary things? [Adora shakes her head yes; Bow nervously pulls his arms in as a defensive pose]
Micah: Pookas travel in packs, hunting their prey across the island, luring them in and surrounding them until it's too late. And right now, they're hunting us.
[Micah stands and grunts as he summons a burst of magic from his hand and fires it across the way; the blast lingers for a moment as it lights up several silhouetted figures with luminescent eyes]
Micah: [shouts] Run!
[Everyone scrambles the opposite direction; creatures skitter and screech all around them]
Bow: [teary eyed, voice breaking slightly, yelling to Adora] We never should have come here without Glimmer! She could've teleported us out in a second! Why couldn't she just trust us?! Why couldn't she trust me?!
Micah: [distressed] Glimmer's in the field?! She's fighting? She's too young. Angella shouldn't have let her-- [looks back at Adora]
[Adora looks back, then looks away pained, quickly bursting ahead of Micah; Micah gains a determined look and reaches out and grabs Adora's arm, forcing her to grunt and stop to look at him]
Micah: [firmly] Tell me the truth. Glimmer's not a little girl anymore, is she? [slight pause] ...How long have I been gone?!
[Micah suddenly looks up as he notices the silence around them]
Swift Wind: [anxiously, desperately] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, silence is always for a bad reason!
Adora: [anxiously] Where did they go?
[A pooka lands in front of them, blinking its large eye, then coming forward out of the darkness; it chitters, looking at all of them]
Bow: [walking forward, leaning forward and putting his hands on his knees] Aww. It's kind of cute.
[Suddenly the pooka throws out its arms and screeches, showing its large teeth; Bow jumps back, screaming as the rest of the group moves back]
Bow: [shouting] But mainly scary!
Micah: I told you!
[The pooka, still roaring, jumps on Bow, who screams and grunts as he pulls it off of him, throwing it on Swift Wind's side; Swift Wind yells and bucks, throwing the pooka away; Swift Wind rears and neighs, running away from the area]
Adora: [calling out and running after him] Swift Wind! 
[The others follow as a pack of pookas bursts from the brush, screeching; Swift Wind nickers and gallops quickly through the jungle, Adora grunting and running behind; he comes to an open area and rears, finally picking a direction and bolting]
Adora: [batting vines out of her way; yelling] Swift Wind! Wait!
[Swift Wind stops, grunting and panting heavily and anxiously as the signal droning amplifies, unintelligible whispers echoing]
Swift Wind: [head drooping] I--
Adora: [grunts as she slices through vines with the sword] Hang on-- [the signal becomes a piercing high-pitched frequency that makes Adora wince and cover an ear and grunt in pain]
Swift Wind: [speaks weakly, haltingly] The signal... [dark vines creep their way up his legs, entwining around his body] You hear it, too, now, don't you? It's so loud... I can't... think straight... [sinks to the ground, letting the vines wrap around him]
Adora: [eyes widen in realization, then she runs to him] No! [Swift Wind lays his head down as Adora runs up and cuts some vines away] Swift Wind, we have to keep going, they're right behind us.
Micah: [as they run up behind] We can't stay! The signal's too strong! [looks back at Bow, who's covering his ears and wincing in pain as vines close in] The pookas lured us right into a trap. We have to move!
[Bow groans in pain, collapsing to his knees] 
Micah: Bow! [vines begin to encircle Bow's body]
Adora: [leaving Swift Wind's side to run over] Bow! [vines catch her arm holding the sword by the wrist] No, not you, too! You have to fight it!
Bow: [dejectedly] It's too late, isn't it? [vines continue to encase his body as his eyes cloud further] ...We couldn't fix it.
Adora: [eyes widening, then firmly] No! We can still get out of here! Micah, help him!
[Micah gasps out and grunts, straining against his own vines as he reaches out for Bow's quiver strap, grasping it and pulling to no avail]
Adora: King Micah!
[Micah groans and reaches for Adora; they grasp forearms and struggle to pull each other free]
Adora: Don't give in now, not after all this time! We'll get you back to Bright Moon! Glimmer needs you to come home and help her be queen and--
Micah: [interrupts] Queen? [eyes widen] If she's queen, then that means... [his eyes search, then get teary, before he finally releases his grip on Adora's arm, his hand slipping from her grasp]
Adora: [desperately] No, no! King Micah! [looks to the others, in states of resignation and defeat, vines encasing them] Bow! Swifty! [with teary eyes; desperately sobs] Please, I can't do this alone! I can't--[sobs] I can't-- [sinks to her knees, her wrist holding the sword still held aloft by vines; voice defeated] I can't do this... Glimmer was right... 
[Adora looks up to the sky as tears fall and vines begin to cover over her vision; suddenly, a bright light shines through; the memory of Angella's final moments appear, with Adora remembering the words, "Take care of each other..."; she continues to remember moments of she and Glimmer fighting over the course of the season, and then many times where the squad and the alliance came together; Adora thinks, "Glimmer?"]
[Adora suddenly gasps awake, eyes shining with a blue magic; she screams and strains against the vines]
Adora: [struggling to stand; determinedly] I won't give up! Not on my friends, not on Etheria, not on myself! [rips the hand holding the sword free and holds it up, shouting] For the Honor of Grayskull!
[She-Ra transformation sequence]
[She-Ra shouts and slams the point of the sword down into the ground, emitting a burst of magical waves that evaporate the vines around them all, making the others grunt as the wave forces them back a little; they all come-to with astounded looks and awed gasps]
Bow: [excitedly] You did it! You're She-Ra again!
Micah: [in awe] She-Ra...
[They all get up as She-Ra's glow fades and she turns to Swift Wind to help him up]
She-Ra: It wasn't the signal that was blocking me from being She-Ra... It was me. [looks at her reflection in her blade] I was afraid of what Glimmer said...that all I've ever done was make things worse. But I promised I'd take care of her... [Swift Wind pokes his head near and neighs happily, making She-Ra smile and rub his chin] ...take care of everyone, and I will.
Micah: [incredulously] So, you're the legendary warrior She-Ra, and my daughter is...Queen?
She-Ra: [placing a hand on his shoulder] There's a lot we need to catch you up on, Your Majesty. But first, let's go save our friends.
[Micah nods, smiling; She-Ra walks past him as the pookas chitter nearby, screeching and growling hungrily in the trees; the squad readies themselves with their weapons and magic, Swift Wind rearing and neighing; the pookas close in, then look into the distance suddenly; a stomping creature makes the pookas chitter and flee into the trees]
Bow: [cheering] Woo-hoo! Yeah! We did it! Take that, you terrifying yet adorably-named creatures!
[A figure slams down behind him, shaking the ground and making dust fly; Bow nervously whines and slowly turns his head to look at the robot]
She-Ra: [sword pointed up at the robot] Get behind me! [everyone follows her orders, ready]
[The robot's mouth slowly opens, and everyone gasps]
Entrapta: [peering down from the robot's mouth, raising her mask; happily] Princesses! I saved you!

New scene
[Crystal Castle, interior]
[Glimmer walks into a large room]
Glimmer: [voice echoing] Light Hope? Is that you?
Light Hope: [appears behind Glimmer; voice slightly angry] The Crystal Castle is intended only for She-Ra and her steed. You are trespassing.
Glimmer: [gasps lightly, then continues] Well...She-Ra's not here right now. [angrily, as Light Hope narrows her eyes] She took Bow and ran off on another stupid mission, and left me...[clears her throat and tries again] ...left us all behind. She's too afraid to use the magic at the Heart of Etheria...but I'm not.
Light Hope: [glitches slightly; considering] Perhaps entrusting She-Ra with this mission was a mistake. Adora is compromised. She is not willing to do what is necessary to protect Etheria...but you are.
Glimmer: [smiling, then resolutely stepping into the light] Yes.
Light Hope: Adora has made much progress, [holds out her hand as projections of the planet and its moons appears] but she still has not succeeded in balancing Etheria. If the planet is not balanced, [a light gets brighter at the center of the projection and then dies out] the Heart of Etheria cannot be accessed.
Glimmer: [considering] Balance the planet... What does that mean? And, how do I do that?
Light Hope: There is only one piece still missing. [lights begin to appear one after the other on the planet] The princesses are conduits for the Heart's power. [the lights begin to feed toward the center, producing the Heart's light from before] They must all be connected to their Runestones for the Heart of Etheria to function.
Glimmer: And that will make us stronger?
Light Hope: It will give you power like you've never known. [Glimmer smirks darkly] The final piece is a princess who has not yet accepted her destiny...
[Scene transition to show Bright Moon as Light Hope's voiceover continues]
Light Hope: [voiceover] A princess robbed of her power by the Horde's meddling.
[Scorpia walks into view of a window in the castle; she pensively leans on the window sill, one claw pressed to the side of her face]
