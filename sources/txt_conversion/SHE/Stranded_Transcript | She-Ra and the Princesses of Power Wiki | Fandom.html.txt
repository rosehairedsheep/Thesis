[Mara's ship cuts through space. Bow stands and removes his space helmet, then consults his tracker pad]
{bleeping}
[Glimmer's arm trembles]
Adora: So, let me make sure I get this right. Catra saved you from Horde Prime. Like "Catra" Catra? Why would she do that? It doesn't make any sense. 
Glimmer: She said she wanted to do one good thing in her life. She said she was doing it for you. 
[Adora looks down. She sinks to the floor]
Adora: {sighs}
Glimmer: There's so much I want to say, to both of you, about what happened on Etheria. About what I said. What I did. What I mean is I'm really, really...
{crash}
Bow: Aah!
[Their ship lurches]
Adora: [gasps] What was that? 
Bow: I'll check on Entrapta. 
[Bow walks out of the room.]
{doors whoosh}
[Tears stream down Glimmer's cheeks]
Glimmer: {sniffling} {sobbing} Adora, I'm so sorry for everything I said. You were right about everything. I should have just listened to you. I didn't know if I'd ever see you again and now I--
Adora: Hey, hey, it's okay. We're here now. And nothing is going to pull us apart again. I really missed you, too. 
{crash}
Adora: Aah! 
Entrapta: Hi. So, slight problem. 
Adora: What's going on? Is it Horde Prime? 
Entrapta: No. Darla and I managed to avoid his ships. Darla says hi, by the way. Darla, say hi.
Darla: Hello. 
Entrapta: Oh, right. Glimmer, Darla is the ship. 
Adora: I mean, why are we lurching? 
Bow: Because our fuel crystals are almost burned out. We're running on empty. 
Entrapta: But not to worry. Darla's sensors have picked up a nearby planet that has a natural supply of the exact fuel crystals we need, and I've set a course. So, all we have to do is gently glide through a rocky debris field, the planet's incredibly dense atmosphere, and gingerly land on a solid crystalline surface. Hang on!
All: Ahh! {yelling} 
(Theme Song)
Scorpia: Good night, everyone. Gotta get that beauty sleep for defeating Horde Prime. There's nothing we can't do after a good night's rest. 
[Scorpia spots Swift Wind looking at the sky.]
Swift Wind: Come on. Pick up, pick up. 
Scorpia: Hey, buddy.
Swift Wind: {gasps}
Scorpia: Oh, sorry! Uh, whatcha doing? 
Swift Wind: I'm, uh, on watch patrol tonight. You know, so just, uh, protecting us from any bots Horde Prime might send. 
Scorpia: Uh-huh. Like you were the night before, and the night before that, and basically every night since Adora left? 
[He gazes up at the sky.]
Scorpia: I can take over if you want? It's getting pretty late. 
Swift Wind: No. That's okay. Uh...I was kind of in the middle of something. 
Scorpia: Ooh, what is it?
Swift Wind: It's nothing. You'd laugh at me. 
Scorpia: I would never. You can tell me. I'm great with secrets. Like, one time, Kyle told me he had a crush on Rogel...Yeah, uh...Never mind. I didn't say anything. What? Anyway, I'm a vault for secrets. 
Swift Wind: I've had this connection to She-Ra. Our sacred bond. And, yeah, I know She-Ra's gone, but I thought maybe I could still connect to Adora. Talk to her, fill her in on what's been going on. 
Scorpia: Oh! Tell her I say hi. 
Swift Wind: That's the problem. I haven't been able to feel her. I've been picking a bright spot in the sky every night, hoping it might be Mara's ship, and sending a daily report, but...
Scorpia: I bet you just haven't picked the right one. Do you think that's them? Or wait. What about that one? No, never mind, that's a moon. How about that one? No. Also a moon. Gosh, have you ever noticed how many moons we have here? It's weird. 
[Scorpia put her arm around the horse]

{wind whistling}
[Meanwhile]
Adora: This is the Crystal Planet? With all the crystals?
Entrapta: Correct. 
Bow: So, then where are the crystals? 
[A barren landscape]
Entrapta: Well, Darla's sensors say the crystals are on this planet, and Darla would never lie to me. So they've gotta be here somewhere. 
{sensor humming}
Glimmer: What is that? It looks like--
Bow: It's a Spire. They're the first wave of Horde Prime's invasion. It's what he's doing to Etheria right now. 
Glimmer: This planet, he destroyed it. That's what he's doing to Etheria? This is all my fault. Horde Prime only found us because--
Bow: Because you activated the Heart of Etheria. 
{bleeping} 
Bow: My tracker pad is picking up an energy signal. Entrapta's right, those crystals must be here somewhere. We'll have to find them on foot I guess.
Entrapta: I'll get to work prepping Darla for the new crystals, removing the old ones. They're ancient. It's a miracle they lasted this long. They must've fused with her engines by now. Oh, it must be so painful for her. 
Darla: I do not feel pain. 
Entrapta: Okay, good luck finding the crystals. Darla and I are going to spend some quality time together. 
[Entrapta readies tools and hurries off]
Adora: Uh...Uh-hm...
[The others set off across the planet.]
Adora: {sighs} 
{wind whistles}
Bow: We're looking for these pink crystals. Thulite. 
Adora: Not a lot of pink here. Or any colors. 
Glimmer: That's okay. We'll find them. We're the Best Friend Squad, and we're great at quests. Right, Bow?
Bow: Yeah. Sure. Come on. 
Glimmer: {sighs} He's still mad at me, isn't he?
Adora: Well, Bow missed you so much. But he was really hurt by everything you--By everything that happened. I think he was so focused on finding you, he never actually worked through all his stuff. 
Glimmer: Well, what do I do? There has to be a way to fix it. 
Adora: You're asking me? {laughs} Wow! Bow's usually the friendship stuff guy and I'm usually the "punch your feelings out" guy. But okay, um...Uh...Maybe if you try-- Oh!
{cracking}
Glimmer: Bow! 
Glimmer & Bow: {grunt}
[A hole opens and Glimmer shoves him, Adora falls through]
Adora: {screams} 
Glimmer: Adora! 
Bow: (voice echoing) Adora! 
Adora: {screams} 
[She drops through a crack in the earth and skids into a rocky cave]
Adora: {grunts}
Glimmer: Are you okay?!
Adora: I'm okay! And I found the crystals! Not the pink ones, though. 
Glimmer: Just stay put, we're coming. We'll have to find another way down. 
Adora: I think I see a light. I'm gonna go towards it. 
Bow: Don't go towards the light! 
Adora: It's not that kind of light! 
[Adora grips her staff and strives forward. On Etheria, Spinnerella sets down a bowl of food and Netossa covers Swift Wind with a blanket. They head to a tent and the horse gazes upwards]
Swift Wind: Adora. Hello from Etheria. It's me, Swift Wind. Oh, man, have I got a lot to catch you up on. So, a lot of people have been looking for you because of the bounty Horde Prime put out, but don't worry, Perfuma and Scorpia took care of them. Kapow! Bam! {chuckles} I don't know, plant noises! Then some drones tried to attack the mountain colonies, but Mermista and Frosta totally handled it. Dag-dag-dag-dag-dag! {laughs} That's ice. That's be being the sound of ice. So, then back at camp, Shadow Weaver was all like, "Perhaps we should use magic to discover Horde Prime's true motivaitons." "Oh, not this again!" "No. Bad Shadow Weaver. Bad." "But magic, magic, magic, power, power, power, blah, blah, blah." {groaning} "Why are you still here?" Everyone was pretty on edge. That's when Sea Hawk got an idea. "Morale-boosting adventure!" It didn't go well. "Ugh make it stop." At all. It was terrible. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen. {laughs} {sighs} Anyway, hope space is fun. And that you're getting these. It's just, uh...{chuckes} I know the others think this is useless. I know. They try to be supportive, but I see it. So, if you could just give me a sign you're hearing this...{sighs} Come home soon, Adora. We need you. 

[On the Crystal Planet, Adora spots footprints on the ground. The lights go out.]
Adora: Hello? 
[A dagger flies past her in a bird swoop]
{whooshing}
Starla: {grunts} Haa!
Adora: Wait!
Tallstar: Intruder!
Adora: Wait, wait, I just--
Jewelstar: Who are you? Why are you following us?
Adora: Why are you hitting me?
Jewelstar: Answer the questions!
Adora: You first! Are you with the Horde?
Jewelstar: No way! 
Adora: Whoa! 
Starla: We're only here for the fuel. After that, we're getting as far away from Horde Prime as possible. 
Jewelstar: Are you with the Horde?
Adora: No. I mean--{grunts} I was, but I'm not anymore. It's complicated, okay? 
Tallstar: What's complicated? 
Starla: {whistling}
Adora: {gasps} 
Jewelstar: Do you serve Horde Prime or not?
Adora: No! Do you?
Jewelstar, Tallstar, & Starla: No!
Adora: {grunts} Then we're all on the same side. Can we please stop hitting each other now? 
[Bow and Glimmer start down and Glimmer slips.]
Glimmer: {yells}
Bow: Glimmer! 
Glimmer & Bow: {panting}
[Bow grabs her] 
Glimmer: Sorry. 
Bow: You should be more careful now that you can't teleport.
Glimmer: I really miss teleporting. Remember when I finally learned how to use my powers? We teleported everywhere. Bright Moon, Mystacor...
Bow: Castaspella hated it. 
Glimmer: But we'd always teleport away just when she was about to catch us. {laughs} {sighs} 
[Bow smiles, then frowns.]
Bow: That was forever ago. A lot's changed since then. 
Glimmer: Uh...um...Yeah. I guess it has.
[Bow starts off and she follows]
Glory: {hoots then chirps} 
[Meanwhile, Adora sits in a circle with the three warriors. Starla feeds the bird and the creature glows. Adora looks around at crystals on the walls. Starla offers a bowl of food.]
Starla: Do you want any? I'm Starla, by the way. And this is my bird, Glory, and my sister Tallstar, and my brother--
Tallstar: Starla, you can't just offer every stranger that shows up our food. 
Starla: It's one person. Besides, we have plenty to share. 
[Adora gobbles the food]
Adora: {gulping} 
Starla: {chuckles} 
Adora: {clears throat} Sorry. And thanks. I'm Adora.
Jewelstar: Jewelstar. And it doesn't matter. 
Tallstar: Once we get the thulite crystals, we're blasting off, and rations won't be a problem. 
Adora: The pink crystals? That's my my friends and I are here. 
Jewelstar: Yeah, but they're pretty much impossible to get to. Stashed away--
Starla: In the center of this cave that--
Tallstar: Is falling apart because of the--
Adora: Earthquakes? 
Jewelstar: We're stranded until we can get them.
Adora: We can't be stuck here. There's no time. Horde Prime invaded Etheria. I have to stop him before he takes it. 
Tallstar: If he's on your planet, it's already over. This place used to be a safe harbor for travelers across the galaxy. Then Horde Prime arrived. Now we're just scavenging the remains. Same as he did to our home world. 
[Starla weeps] 
Starla: {sniffling} 
Tallstar: If you're smart, you'll run away. Far, far away. Like we're trying to do. 
Adora: Well, I'm not. Running away, that is. I am smart. Never mind. Look, I'm a part of a rebellion, fighting the Horde. Once my friends find me and we get fuel, I'm going to face Prime, and I'm gonna stop him.  
Starla: Wow! Really? 
Adora: Really. Why don't you help us fight back? You've got the tech and the weapons, wh--You could do so much more than just scavenge. You could-- 
Tallstar: Get killed? Prime has already taken our home. Do you think we'd be on this wreck of a planet if we had a choice? Horde Prime always wins. He's unstoppable.  
Jewelstar: And you're just one girl with a stick. What could you possibly do?  
Adora: Well, I used to be stronger. But that doesn't matter. If everyone works together, I know we can take him down. He has to pay for what he did, and he--He has someone on his ship. Someone I--We're stopping him. Period.  
Jewelstar: If your friend is with Prime, it's already too late.  
Adora: Oh, no. Catra is not my friend. I mean, she's--she used to be, but that was a long time ago, and she's tried to kill me a bunch of times since then, but then she saved Glimmer. And maybe that means there's still good in her, and now I don't know. It's...{sighs} It's complicated.  
Tallstar: Everything seems really complicated with you.  
Jewelstar: Whatever she is, friend or not, she's gone. There's no point in going back for her. No one stands up to Prime and survives. I'm sorry.  
Glimmer: Bow, wait up! Bow! Would you please slow down? 
Bow: I just wanna get back to the ship. {gasps}  
Adora: It's all right. They're my friends.  
Tallstar: They don't sound like friends.  
Adora: Are you guys--? 
Bow: We're fine. Who are the space pirates?  
{rumbling} 
[The cave quakes and crystals drop from the ceiling] 
{crystals shattering} 
Adora: These are the Star Siblings. They're after the same thing we are, and we should all be working together. You know where the fuel crystals are, and we can help. What do you say?  
Entrapta: Hello! 
{all gasp}  
Tallstar: Okay. How many of you are there?  
Entrapta: Several. Adora, I came as fast as I could to warn you. Darla's sensors indicate that this planet is a apparently a hotbed of seismic activity.  
Adora: Yeah, uh, we kind of learned that the hard way.  
Entrapta: Well, Darla and I figured out an algorithm to predict the tremors and we're sort of running out of time before the really big one hits. So, are we getting the thulite now or... 
Jewelstar: Fine. We need to hurry. Let's go.  
[They set off together] 
Jewelstar: Once we get to the cavern, you'll-- 
Tallstar: Be awesome and hold the-- 
Starla: Then Jewel will cover Glory and me while we wing fling.  
Jewelstar: Just absolutely not.  
Starla: You're saying you won't cover me? You kind of have to. You're my big brother.  
Tallstar: Yeah, ouch, Jewel. Cold.  
Jewelstar: No, just--of course I'll--just don't do anything fancy. Get the crystals and get out. We don't want another-- 
Tallstar: Eridani.  
Starla: Or Aquarii. We should not have gotten fancy there. 
Glory: {chirps}  
Tallstar: Uh! Think fast.  
Starla: {laughs} 
Jewelstar: {grunts}  
Glimmer: You guys are pretty close, huh? 
Tallstar: Yeah. Growing up under the threat of Horde Prime does that to you. We've lost a lot, but we still have each other.  
[Glimmer glances back at Bow and he walks past her.] 
Glimmer: Uh...{sighs} 
[They follow the Star Siblings, then stop.] 
Jewelstar: There it is. That's the thulite.  
Bow: We have to get over that?  
Starla: The chasm is wider than last time we tried. It's getting worse. This whole planet is falling apart.  
Entrapta: Uh-uh...according to these readings, there's gonna be another quake soon.  
Adora: A bridge! If we knock this column over during the next quake, we could bridge the gap and get across.  
Tallstar: It's risky, but it might work. Everyone, get ready.  
Entrapta: Three, two, one!  
[They shove the column and it falls across the chasm.  
{all groaning} {crash}  
Starla: Let's do this.  
[They hurry across] 
Adora: {gasps}  
Tallstar: No! That's our only way out.  
Adora: No.  
[Adora and Tallstar raise the column] 
Adora: {groans}  
[The ground cracks beneath Glimmer's feet] 
{crystal shatters}  
Glimmer: {gasps} What's happening?  
Bow: Glimmer! 
Glimmer: {screams} Bow!  
Jewelstar: It won't hold! We need to turn back!  
[Glimmer clings to a rock face] 
Glimmer: {gasps}  
Bow: Jump! I'll catch you!  
[Glimmer looks up at the pink crystals] 
Glimmer: We can't! This is our one shot.  
Bow: It's too dangerous!  
Glimmer: Please, Bow. Just trust me, okay?  
[He nods and she climbs up] 
Jewelstar: Ahh...! 
[Jewel pierces with his sword and a chunk of rock cracks off the ceiling and plummets towards him. Starla and Glory blast it away] 
Glory: {whistles}  
Bow: {grunts} 
[Bow assists with the column] 
Jewelstar: Your friend better hurry.  
{bleeping} 
Entrapta: Uh-oh!  
Adora: Uh-oh. What do you mean "uh-oh?  
Entrapta: Slight hiccup in my calculations. The seismic activity is increasing faster than anticipated.  
Tallstar: What does that mean?  
Entrapta: We're out of time. They need to come back now before this whole place breaks apart!  
Glimmer: You can do this.  
[Glimmer reaches the top] 
Glimmer: {gasps}  
[The grounds crumbles]  
Jewelstar: We need to get out of here, now!  
[Bow fastens a rope around the the sword and uses his arrow to brace it. Jewel and Starla race across] 
Starla: {gasps}  
Bow: Go! We're right behind you!  
[They nod and run off] 
Bow: Glimmer.  
Adora: {groans}  
[Entrapta checks her computer] 
Entrapta: There's no time!  
Tallstar: {groans} I can't hold it anymore.  
Adora: No! Hang on!  
[Tallstar's arms fall apart and she collapses] 
Tallstar: {grunts}  
Adora: My friends are on the other side. I am not going anywhere. I'm not leaving anyone behind. {yells}  
[She glows and and raises the boulder] 
{rock shattering}  
[The chamber fills with golden light; Adora drops to her knees] 
Tallstar: Was that magic?  
[Adora blinks] 
Entrapta: She-Ra. I think that was She-Ra.  
{rumbling} 
[Glimmer falls with an arm full of crystals and Bow catches her] 
Glimmer: {yells}  
[The rope snaps] 
Glimmer: No!  
[The column falls] 
Bow: Ready to do something that probably won't work? 
Glimmer: Always.  
[Bow fires an arrow with a rope and they swing across the chasm. Bow grips the ledge on the other side and Glimmer falls. He grabs her hand] 
Glimmer: {screams} 
Bow: {yells}  
Glimmer: Bow.  
[They others haul them up] 
Bow: Glimmer, are you okay?  
Glimmer: Yeah. I'm okay.  
[Bow smiles] 
Adora: Come on.  
{rumbling} 
[Rocks and crystals crash around them and they run out of the cave as the opening is blocked with a pile of boulders.] 
Starla: Wow! Oh! We did it. We actually did it.  
Adora: {sighs}  
Glimmer: {sighs}  
[Bow turns and walks away. Later, the Star Siblings whisper.] 
Starla: Did you see what she did?  
{all murmuring}  
[Adora approaches] 
Jewelstar: Thank you for helping us get the fuel. You Etherians are so reckless.  
Starla: Stubborn. 
Tallstar: And brave. Magic hasn't been seen in the universe in centuries. But what I saw you do, you might actually be able to take on Prime. And we want in.  
Jewelstar: We've spent our whole lives running away. But not anymore.  
Starla: We're going to fight Prime and take back our home.  
Adora: Then welcome to the Rebellion.  
[They shake hands]  
Darla: Two light stores replenished. Ship refueled.  
[Glimmer finds Bow on Mara's ship] 
Glimmer: Look, I know you're still mad at me. Maybe you'll be mad at me for a really long time. I deserve it. And maybe--maybe we'll--maybe we'll never be friends like we used to be. But I'm not going to stop trying to make it better. I made a mistake with the Heart of Etheria. I should have listened to you, and I'm sorry. You get to be mad, for as long as you need to be. But I'm not going anywhere. And when you're ready, I'll be here.  
[Bow shuts the computer and glances back, then takes her hands] 
Bow: Okay.  
[Adora smiles, then turns to look at the sky]  
Glimmer: Adora? Are you okay?  
Adora: Yeah. I just--look, I know this is gonna sound crazy and dangerous, and I know Catra was our enemy and she's done a lot of bad things and hurt a lot of people, but-- 
Glimmer: You wanna go back for her.  
Adora: Mm-hm.  
[Adora nods] 
Adora: I can't just leave her there. I have to try.  
Glimmer: Catra sacrificed herself to save me. Whatever you need to do, I'm with you.  
Bow: Then let's do this. Best Friend Squad style.  
Adora and Glimmer: {sigh}  
[They embrace. On Etheria, Swift Wind's horn glows] 
Swift Wind: {gasps}  
Scorpia: Oh! Oh! What is it? What's going on? 
Swift Wind: I felt her. She-Ra is back.  
[Credits Roll]
