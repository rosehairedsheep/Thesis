[Episode opens on Light Spinner and multiple teenagers practicing magic.]
Micah: Woah...
Light Spinner: Impressive casting, Micah. But you allow yourself to become distracted.
Kids: Oooooooh
Micah: You can't expect me to out-cast Light Spinner; the greatest sorceress to ever walk the halls of Mystacor.
Light Spinner: I have no time for your flattery. If you're going to interrupt my lessons, you might at least apply yourself. I want focus as you cast your illusions.
Micah: Light Spinner, wait.
Light Spinner:What is it this time, Micah?
Micah: I'm bored. I've been doing light illusions since before I can even remember.
[Micah follows Light Spinner as she helps the others fix their castings.]
Micah: Teach me something real. I wanna levitate, and travel through mirrors, and shapeshift! You know, the cool stuff.
Light Spinner: The Guild forbids third years from learning such things. You know that, Micah.
[Light Spinner walks away and Micah follows, using illusion magic to appear as Norwyn, the Head of the Guild of Sorcerers.]
Micah: {Mockingly} The Guild of Sorcerers prides itself on being out-of-touch geezers. We wouldn't want anyone to learn actual magic or anything fun.
[Light Spinner stops and looks back at Micah]
Light Spinner: That's a poor likeness of Master Norwyn.
Micah: [Reveals himself] Then teach me shapeshifting!
Light Spinner: Patience, Micah. You must start at the beginning.

New scene
[Transfer to the present, revealing Shadow Weaver reflecting in her cell in the Fright Zone. She uses her nail to scratch a line in the wall. Catra approaches with a tray of food, opening the door]
Catra: Why do you bother? You're never getting out of this cell.
[Catra smirks and drops the tray, letting it clatter before walking out of the cell and closing the door behind her as Shadow Weaver leans back against the wall.]
[Opening them plays]

New Scene
[In the Fright Zone, robotic arms are seen piecing pieces of metal armor to Hordak's body. He cries out in pain when one accidentally drags across his chest, angrily smacking it away and knocking the item it held out of its grip. He walks over to grab it, hesitating at the sight of what it was before sighing and picking it. He walks back to where he was as Catra approaches.]
Catra: Lord Hordak?
[She gasps at the sight of him, quickly kneeling. Hordak keeps his back turned, folding his hands behind it.
Hordak: [Scoffs] Why is Shadow Weaver still in the Fright Zone?
Catra: She's--She's my prisoner.
Hordak: A dangerous one. I want her banished to Beast Island at once.
Catra: [Stands] What?
[Hordak turns to face her, angry] 
Catra: Lord Hordak, Shadow Weaver is still useful to us if we can get her to talk. She knows more about Etheria than anyone else.
Hordak: And also about the Fright Zone. Have you considered the consequences if that information were to fall into the wrong hands?
Catra: That won't happen. Without the Black Garnet, she's completely powerless. I can handle her.
[Catra gasps as the power goes out, tensing before shouting as she is startled by Entrapta working on wires behind her, the lights turning back on.]
Entrapta: Oh, hi Catra! What are you doing here?
Catra: I'm a Force Captain. What are you doing here?
Entrapta: I've been integrating the First Ones' tech we got from the Northern Reach into Hordak's pre-existing portal mainframe, but it maybe slightly, completely overloaded the Fright Zone energy grid. So we're gonna have to redesign that.
[Entrapta smiles and walks over to stand by Hordak.]
Hordak: What Entrapta is doing does not concern you, Force Captain.
Entrapta: Oh, were you two having a meeting? Sorry, again. I guess I should be going.
Hordak: No, you stay. [Walks to Catra] you have two days to extract whatever information you can from your prisoner. Then you will banish her to Beast island.
Catra: But-
Hordak: Do you understand? Or do i have to make myself understood?
Catra: No, Lord Hordak. I understand.
Hordak: Good. Dismissed.
[Catra reluctantly walks away, turning back to see Entrapta sitting on the arm of Hordak's throne as she talked to him]
Entrapta: We should be able to initiate our first test of the portal machine as soon as I rebuild the electrical grid.
[Catra finishes her walk out, angry]

New scene
[Back in Shadow Weaver's cell, she reaches for the tray of food, the shackles around her wrists preventing her from reaching it. She attempts to use magic to draw the tray closer, only to fail before reflecting on another memory.]

New scene
[Light Spinner uses her magic to bring a pink crystal in front of Micah]
Micah: [gasps] You actually moved it. How?
Light Spinner: There's magic everywhere.[sets a hand on Micah's shoulder and begins to walk away] The Princesses channel elemental magic through their Runestones.
[Micah inspects and knaws on the crystal in the background]
Light Spinner: But sorcerers can learn to channel lesser power through spells and incantation after many years of serious study and discipline.
Micah: [quickly takes crystal out of his mouth and chuckled sheepishly] Oh.
Light Spinner: The Guild brings those who have a talent for magic to study here in Mystacor. But I only train the truly gifted. [uses magic to drag the crystal across the table with Micah watching] You're one of the most talented students I've ever seen. But you lack dedication.
Micah: I'll prove it to you that I'm worthy. Here, I'll show you.
[Micah reaches out to the crystal before Light Spinner set her hand on top of his]
Light Spinner: Not yet. First, you must promise to do exactly as I say.
[Micah and Light Spinner grab armfuls of crystals off the walls, a sorceress walking into the room just as they run out]
[Micah is shown grinding the crystals to a blue powder, Light Spinner holding some in her hand and watching it glow, Micah grabbing some as well and smiling at the glow it emitted. 
Micah: Huh? [chuckles]
[Light Spinner uses the powder to draw a symbol on the ground which glows and turns black, she then grabs a scroll and starts to read through it]
[Micah grabs some of the powder and runs off, adding a bit to the symbol that makes it glow red then blue to show he had fixed it]
Micah: [laughs]

New scene
[they both stand across from each other with a basin and exchanged a look]
[Light Spinner creates a symbol mid-air and moves it over the basin, the symbol transforming into a diamond]
Light Spinner: [grunts in focus as she tried to change its shape]
[Micah creates his own small diamond, adding his magic to Light Spinner's and making it a 3D pink diamond, bubbles of water from the basin below coming up and circling around it before it all descended]
Light Spinner: Impossible.. [leans across the basin, glaring at him accusingly] Who else has been teaching you?
Micah: No one. I just did what you taught me. Did I do something wrong?
Light Spinner: No. I knew you were gifted, I just didn't realize how gifted. You have incredible power! [she turns away] And I'm the one who will mold that power.
Micah: So you'll keep teaching me?
Light Spinner: Of course. [sets her hands on his shoulders] We're going to do great things together.
Micah: [jumps and punches the air in excitement] Yes! I mean, ahem, thank you, Light Spinner.
Light Spinner: The Guild needs talents like ours more than ever before. Perhaps-- [looks away in thought] No.. yo're not ready.
Micah: I-- I know I have a lot to learn, but I'm ready for anything. What is it?
Light Spinner: [looks into the basin] Show me. [the water glowed and showed them Horde tanks firing]
Micah: It's awful. Why would you conjure this?
Light Spinner: It's no illusion. This is really happening. An army has invaded our lands. They call themselves [she taps the top of the water, creating a ripple before it showed a Horde flag flapping in the windwith fire surrounding it] the Horde. The Princesses have proved ineffective against their strength. They've accomplished much more in a short time, more than our so-called leaders have.
Micah: We have to do something!
Light Spinner: Easy, Micah. The Sorcerers' Guild meets tomorrow to decide a course of action. I have a plan to give us the power needed to stop the Horde. I only hope that Norwyn and his followers can see the threat as clearly as you do.
Micah: You'll make them see. If anyone can do it, it's you.
[Micah sets an assuring hand on her arm, Light Spinner seeming surprised at his support and determination]

New scene
[shows Shadow Weaver still on the floor of her cell, glaring at the floor from the memory]

New scene
[Catra is shown perched on a railing outside, jumping a little as it shook, clinging to it. Camera pans over to show Scorpia having walked up, chuckling]
Catra: How'd you find me?
Scorpia: You always come here when you're upset. Also, I looked everywhere. Now, what's troubling my bestie? [nudges her]
Catra: [swats her claw away] I'm not your bestie.
Scorpia: Oh, I don't accept any of that.
Catra: [raising her voice a bit] Yeah, well, get used to not getting what you want in life. [expression softens as she looks away and sighs] Hordak is making me send Shadow Weaver to Beast Island.
Scorpia:  Wait. Beast Island is real? [accidentally rips a piece of the railing off with her claw] Oops. That's not good. Oh, shoot. Okay, let me just fix that. [accidentally breaks it even more] Uh, Catra, can I get a hand?
[She turns only to see she was gone, starting to walk] Catra? [drops the broken railing and runs, finding Catra with her knees to her chest around a corner, approaching her carefully and sitting down] I thought Beast Island was just a story they told to keep us in line. Being sent there is supposed to be a fate worse than death!
[Catra turned and glared at her]
Scorpia: I bet there,s some nice stuff, too. Maybe Shadow Weaver will write and tell us.
Catra: What is wrong with you? People don't send letters from Beat Island. They go and never come back.
Catra: [she walks off a bit] It doesn't matter how hard I work or what I do, Hordak doesn't trust me. He never listens to me. Shadow Weaver is useful and she can help us.
Scorpia: Seriously/ Because she hasn't exactly given us any information.. Why do you really wanna keep her around? She's never been very nice to you. I thought you kind of hated her.
Catra: You-- [epression and tone softens as she looks to the side] You wouldn't understand. [she then jumps off, Scorpia reaching out to stop her and missing]
Scorpia: [sighs and looks up at the three aligned moons, which faded into another memory]

New scene
Light Spinner: We can no longer stand by while the Horde conquers more and more territory. [the camera pans down to show Light Spinner speaking in a meeting] The Princesses have been unable to stop them, and now they have taken a runestone, the Black Garnet.
[she uses her magic that shows a bright light before showing tons of Horde soldiers wrapping ropes around and stealing the Black Garnet, causing multiple of the sorceresses to gasp]
Sorceress: No.
Another sorceress: No, it can't be..
Light Spinner: We may not have Runestones, but there is a way we can make ourselves strong enough to stand against the Horde. [she taps the top of the water, the sight of the Horde soldiers and the Black Garnet draining into it and being replaced with a symbol that turned red as she spoke] Cast the Spell of Obtainment and take power for ourselves! [the symbol reflected in her eyes as the camera zoomed into them]
Head Sorcerer: What you propose is forbidden, Light Spinner. The Spell of Obtainment leeches power, turning the caster into a magical parasite. If it does not kill the caster outright. [he walked up to and around her as he spoke, facing Shadow Weaver from the other side of the symbol]
Light Spinner: But I've modified the spell. Tonight the three Moons of Enchantment come into alignment. [the camera changes view to show a picture of the three moons lined up together] This will make all the magic of Etheria stronger. Think of the good we'll do!
Head Sorcerer: There can be no good from this.
Light Spinner: [slams hands down on the rim of the basin, leaning forward] So we do nothing?
Head Sorcerer: The Princesses will settle the problem. Etheria will take care of itself as it has always done, without resorting to twisted spells. [he waves his hand, his blue magic melting the pink symbol]
Light Spinner: [angrily] You know I'm right. If we don't fight, [she turns to the other sorcerers] if we don't become stronger, we won't have a planet to protect!
Head Sorcerer: Be satisfied with what you have, Light Spinner. Some power is not meant for you.
Light Spinner: [glares at him] You're all blind.

New scene
[there are teenage sorceresses laughing and walking with Micah right behind them. Micah turns and sees Light Spinner through the windows, climbing in through one of them and running after Light Spinner while she walked down the hallway]
Micah: What did they say?
Light Spinner: {continues walking without looking back] They refuse to lend me their strength to do what must be done. They never listen to me! After everything I've done, I still haven't earned their trust.
Light Spinner: [both stop walking] Norwyn and those fools don't care about magic, they just wanna hold the rest of us back.[she shoots energy out on the floor in front of her, which scares away a couple kids up ahead]
Micah: Then go back and make them understand. The Horde will destroy Etheria if we don't stop them.
Light Spinner: [glances back at him in surprise as she got an idea] If you want to help Etheria, there is another way.
Micah: [smiles and nods]

New scene
Catra: [walks into Shadow Weaver's cell] Pack your bags. You're going to Beast Island.
Shadow Weaver: [opens her eyes but stay facing away from her]
Catra: Oh, that's right, [tauntingly while while walking over] heh, you don't have anything.
Shadow Weaver: When?
Catra: Don't you care? [her voice becomes more confused] It's a death sentence. What don't you get about that? You're a goner unless you can give me a reason good enough to convince Hordak you're worth keeping around. [pauses for an answer but Shadow Weaver just looks away] Don't you have anything to say? Just give me something!
Shadow Weaver: I've given everything I have to the Horde.
Catra: You really are useless. [begins walking away] You are getting what you deserve.
Shadow Weaver: Wait
[Catra stops but doesn't look back
Shadow Weaver: Take pity on an old, powerless women. I know my days are here are numbered. I want to see my old Sorcerer's Guild badge one last time. It must be among my things. Bring it to me. It's the last thing I'll ever ask of you.
Catra: [her tail sways as she listens] You don't get to ask things of me anymore. [she walks out, the cell closing behind her and Shadow Weaver thinking back to yet another memory]

New scene
Light Spinner: [walks over to her magic basin with Micah following behind her] The Spell of Obtainment is difficult. You must stay focused, though. Once we begin casting, we cannot stop.
Micah: [nervously] Are you sure about this?
Light Spinner: We need this power. It's the only way to protect our people. [she pulls out a small vial of the blue powder, the camera focusing on it and blurring Micah in the background temporarily before refocusing on him]
Micah: [nods in understanding]
Light Spinner: [sprinkles the powder into the basin, the camera panning around them in a circle] Do exactly as we practiced.
[they both lightly touch the top of the water, the rows of water around them gaining glowing symbols on them while the two worked together to draw a symbol on the water]
[light goes up and crated a 3D blue and purple diamond mid-air]
Micah: [gasps in awe at it]
Light Spinner: [opens her eyes to see a purple substance growing from withing the diamond, many hands pushing at the walls from inside it]
Micah: Light Spinner, what's happening? What is that?
Light Spinner: [gasps and rushes to fix the symbol in the basin with Micah's help] Hold it steady. Do not stop now.
[the hands from inside kept pushing harder, the substance growing by the second and soon breaking the diamond apart despite their best efforts, the lights going red and the thing growing multiple eyes]
Micah: [struggles to keep the hands from the thing from grabbing at him] This-- this isn't right! [he begins running away, leaving Light Spinner behind]
Light Spinner: No! [the creature roared and grabbed her before she could escape]
Micah: [looks back as he hears her struggle] Light Spinner! [he runs in to try and save her, but is too late as the thing pulls her up and into itself, creating a huge burst of light that whites out the screen]
[as the light clears, Micah is on the ground, Light Spinner in the background groaning in pain with dark magic surrounding her]
Micah: [pushes himself back up] Light Spinner! [he began running over, only to be pushed away by a large shield of dark magic surrounding her]
Micah: [grunting before he was caught by the Head Sorcerer]
Head Sorcerer: Micah, what is the meaning of all this?
Micah: [slowly] Light Spinner?
Light Spinner: Micah, how could you? After everything I've taught you. [camera pans up slowly through the dark magic surrounding her, showing she had one hand over her badly scarred face] The spell was working.
Micah: The spell was evil. You saw what it was doing to the room, to us.
Head Sorcerer: [steps forward] You've always hungered after power. Bringing you into our ranks was a grave mistake. [he brings up a glowing blue symbol and expanded it]
Light Spinner: The only mistake was seeking the approval of a fool like you. You're all weak! None of you deserve my help. [grunts and shouts, the dark magic around her growing]
[the Head Sorcerer and a few of the other sorceresses shot blue magic at her, only for Light Spinner to shoot right back, blasting away the other two sorceresses. They both flew at each other, Head Sorcerer shooting and missing,Light Spinner taking the chance and covering his face with dark magic. It grew over him, the Head Sorcerer disappearing into it.]
Light Spinner: The spell worked. I am stronger than all of you. [her voice grew deeper and raspy as she grew bigger, towering over Micah
Micah: [he attempted to bring up a shield but it was completely uneffective, tendrils of dark magic grabbing and pulling him up] Light Spinner, please, don't.
[Light Spinner reached his hand slowly down to his face, Micah squeezing his eyes shut only to open them when she unexpectedly cup his cheek in an almost motherly manner. They met eyes momentarily before she let go of him, setting him down before disappearing]
Micah: [grunts and looks around, everything looking exactly how it was except that he was alone]

New scene
[a few Horde soldiers turned their heads as they heard glass break, seeing lights going out one by one as Light Spinner walked up through the shadows.]
Horde Soldier: [a lady Horde soldier ran over to her, holding an electrified weapon and another soldier coming up next to her] Halt. What business do you have in the Fright Zone?
[Light Spinner flicks her hand, tendrils of dark magic wrapping around the lady Horde soldier and devouring her while she screamed. Light Spinner then walked up to the second guard, who immediately put his hands in the air and dropped his weapon.]
Light Spinner: Tell Hordak there is someone here who can help take him to victory.

New scene
[the camera pans down at the current Fright Zone, showing the aligned moons before showing inside the building]
Catra: [standing at the door with a tray of food] So, have you come up with anything to save your skin?
Shadow Weaver: You know I haven't. [raises her head and glares while Catra walked over]
Catra: [drops the tray in front of her with a smug smirk]
Shadow Weaver: Why do you insist on delivering my meals yourself? Surely, you have more important things to do.
Catra: [leans against the wall and crosses her arms] I guess I just like seeing you in shackles.
Shadow Weaver: We both know that's not the only reason. What do you want, Catra?
Catra:  [turns to face her] Why..? [pauses and sighs] Why did you treat me like the way you did? Why was I never good enough? Really, I wanna know.
Shadow Weaver: [looks away] Because you remind me of myself. You always have. Nothing was ever easy for me either. I wasn't born to power like Adora and the others. I had to earn my power, fight for it. Why should it be any different for you?
Catra: I was a child when you took me in. What could I have possibly done to deserve the way you treated me? [she went to her knees, sitting in front of Shadow Weaver] I am nothing like you. You are old, and bitter, and weak.
Shadow Weaver: Ah. But you are like me. And just like me, you're losing your position with Hordak. I can see that even from my cell.
Catra: You don't know what you're talking about.
Shadow Weaver: You're being pushed out.
Catra: I am not. It's just Entrapta understands all that tech stuff. [pauses for a moment in realization]
Shadow Weaver: Come here. [she opens her arms in offering, looking at her understandingly]
Catra: [glances at her before looking away in contemplation, slowly moving closer to her]
Shadow Weaver: [gently strokes Catra's hair] She's earned his trust. How did you let this happen? Don't you see? I want you to go further than I did, but you need to be smarter than me. Stronger than me.
Catra: [pleadingly] Then help me. Come up with something so you can stay.
Shadow Weaver: [cups the side of her face, letting Catra lean into it] I will try. [she takes her hand away again and moves away] But I'm tired now. Come back later. Please.
Catra: [blushes faintly and hugs herself, getting up and opening the door to leave, tapping a button to a recording ear piece she had in with a slight smile as she left]
Shadow Weaver: [looks over when the door closed, looking through her food and finding her old Guild badge hidden in their for her, picking it up and having a flashback]

New scene
[Shadow Weaver stood at the Black Garnet, doing magic with it before hearing a baby crying, walking out of the room to find two Horde guys holding a swaddled, crying baby with a tuft of blonde hair. She eyed it before continuing to walk up to Hordak, bowing before him]
Shadow Weaver: Was your excursion successful, Lord Hordak?
Hordak: I arrived too late. I found something but it's useless. Put it with the other infants in the infirmary.
Shadow Weaver: [she stood and faced the two guys with the baby, watching them walk away with it] This one is different. [she turned to face Hordak] Can't you feel it? She has power.
Hordak: Fine, take it. Just get it out of here.
[Shadow Weaver held the baby as it was handed to her, uncovering it's face. The baby looked up at her, her crying ceasing and her hand touching Shadow Weaver's]
Shadow Weaver: [gasps] Oh. Oh, don't worry, little one. We're going to do great things together. [she held baby Adora close, letting her touch her mask]

New scene
[the camera zooms in on current Shadow Weaver as she looked up]
Shadow Weaver: It's time.
[the camera shows the perfectly aligned moons before going back to Shadow Weaver]
[she clutched the Guild badge before smashing it on the ground, picking up the blue powder that had been stored in there, panting as she used it to draw a symbol that gave her a bit of power back]

New scene
[not long after, Catra walked up and took a deep breath before walking up to the see-through door with a sheepish smile]
Catra: Uh, okay. I know it hasn't been that long, but I figured we could brainstorm together. [she then paused, her smile falling as she looked in the cell to see Shadow Weaver standing with her back to her]
Catra: Come on, two devious minds such as ours are-- [she went to put her hand on Shadow Weaver's shoulder, pausing as her hand went right through the illusion] Huh? [she reached forward, her hand going right through it again]
Catra: [gasps in realization] You were just using me all along. [she curled in on herself and growled before lashing out, clawing at the illusion and it disappearing as she crumbled to the ground]
Catra: [she grunted and punched the ground before noticing the symbol on the floor, swiping it away and breaking down in tears, shouting as the camera panned out from her to outside]

New scene
[Adora was with Bow and Glimmer, holding up a rod from atop the roof to try and get a signal.]
Bow: [looks up at her quizzically] A little to the left.
Adora: [moves to the left some] This good?
Bow: Better. Okay, now, Glimmer, move yours more to the right.
[Glimmer groans and teleports up to her side of the roof, tilting her rod a little before teleporting down]
Bow: My right.
[Glimmer groans again but louder, teleporting off screen and reappearing next to Bow again]
Glimmer: Why are we.. [teleports off screen and back again] up on the roof.. [teleports again and reappears back] in the middle of the night again? [yawns]
Bow: You know how I thought my Tracker Pad had broken back in Alwyn? Well, I've been studying it, and I realized the garbled static I keep getting on my screen isn't a bug. It's picking up some kind of transmission. With these three moons in alignment, all transmissions should be stronger.. Adora, higher and more out-ish!
Adora: [reaches out as far as she can before her foot slipped, starting to fall to the ground] Guys?
Bow: [not noticing her fall as he was looking at his tracker pad, though Glimmer did notice and teleported off to save Adora while Bow was talking] Hold still! It's working! We did it! Guys, you gotta see this. [looks around in confusion as he noticed both of them were gone] 
[they both reappear behind him, Glimmer sets Adora down] 
Adora: Please tell me you got the message. 
Bow: [turns around to face them] Some of it's degraded. Can you read the rest? 
Adora: [looks at the tracker pad as it's held in front of her] "Serenia. Portal. Mara." What's a Serenia? 
Glimmer: I don't know. But if it has to do with Mara, it can't be good..
