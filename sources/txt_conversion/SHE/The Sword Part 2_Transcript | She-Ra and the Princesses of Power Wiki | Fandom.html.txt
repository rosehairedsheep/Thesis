[Theme Plays]
{A white light flashes and a warrior princess with flowing long hair stands before a bug-like creature. The creature kneels and Glimmer and Bow watch nearby.} 
Bow: Glimmer?
Glimmer: Yeah, I see her, Bow.
Bow: Okay. I wanted to make sure it wasn't just me.
{Adora has transformed into a warrior princess. She looks at the sword in her hands}
Adora: [Screams] [Panting] Huh?
{The Princess morphs back into Adora. Glimmer teleports forward and tugs on the sword.}
[Both Grunting]
Glimmer: Stay where you are!
Adora: What did you do to me?
Glimmer: What do you mean what did 'I' do to you?
Adora: I didn't know being a princess was contagious!
Bow: Okay, okay, everyone, calm down! Wanna tell us how you did that?
Adora: I didn't do anything. All I did was pick up the sword, and then, whoosh, I'm in a tiara!
Glimmer: I don't care how she did it. We just have to make sure she never does it again!
{Glimmer has the sword. The creature rises and stabs the ground with its front talons.}
[Roaring]
[All Shouting]
[Roars]
{Bow takes the sword and runs to Adora.}
Bow: Do it again! Do it again!
Glimmer: [Sighs] Bow!
Bow: Do what you did before.
Adora: I don't know what I did before!
Glimmer: No time. We have to go.
{They run through a forest as the creature chases them. They reach the edge of a cliff and fall over the side, then land below in a heap. Symbols on the ground lead to a triangular structure.}
[All Grunting and Shouting]
[All Groaning]
Adora: What is this place?
{The beast looms above.}
Bow: No idea, but in there's gotta be better than out here. [Grunting]
{The creature scurries over the side and Bow runs at an entryway.}
Glimmer: Everyone, grab on, I can get us in there!
Bow: Glimmer, no! You've never teleported three people before.
Glimmer: Do you have a better idea?
[Both Gasp]
{The creature approaches.}
Adora: What's written on this door? It looks like some kind of password.
Bow: You can read that?
Adora: You can't?
Bow: What's it say?
Adora: Uh, "Eternia."
{The triangular door glows and opens.}
Glimmer: Oh, come on!
{They hurry inside and the door closes on the beast.}

Scene change
{Glimmer lights an orb in the dark hallway.}
Bow: So, Horde soldier, have you always been able to read First Ones' writing?
Glimmer: Wanna tell us what exactly is going on here?
Adora: I told you I don't know I just read the word on the door.
Glimmer: Right... [Chuckles] You read a word in a language that no one's spoken for a thousand years, and the door just opened into a mysterious ancient ruin. Sure.
Adora: You think I did this on purpose? You think I wanted to be a princess? Princesses are monsters.
Glimmer: Monsters? You're the monster!
Bow: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Glimmer, she did save us.
Glimmer: I don't care! We can't just trust her, Bow. Or have you forgotten everything the Horde's done to us? The people we've lost. [Sobbing] We need to find another way out of here and get her back to Bright Moon as soon as possible. My mother will know what to do with her.
Bow: Hey, so, thanks for saving us from that bug thing back there when you could've escaped instead.
Adora: Okay, well I didn't save you. I just wanted to get the sword, okay?
Bow: Are you sure it's not because you secretly like us?
Adora: [Chuckles] Wh--? I don't like you. You're my captors.
Bow: Sure.

Scene change
Bow: Thanks for saving us anyway. I'm Bow, by the way.
Adora: Adora.
Bow: "Adora." Ah. Weird name for a Horde soldier.
Adora: Is it?
{Glimmer stares at the sword.}
Glimmer: [Whispers] For the honor of Grayskull.
Bow: What are we doing?
Glimmer: Nothing! I mean, uhh.. Look at these carvings. I think this might be a First Ones' ruin.
Adora: What's a First One?
Glimmer: You've never heard of the First Ones?
Bow: The First Ones are the original settlers of Etheria. They disappeared a thousand year ago, but they left behind a lot of old ruins and technology. Like this place.
Adora: So, what happened to them?
Bow: No one knows. They just disappeared. The Horde didn't tell you about them?
Adora: Seems like there's a lot the Horde didn't tell me.
Glimmer: Ugh. How do we get out of here?
Bow: [Sighs] It'll take forever to find a way out at this rate. [Gasps] Hey! Wanna turn on some lights, Adora?
Adora: I don't know how to do that.
Bow: Maybe there's a magic word. Ooh, what's the First Ones' word for "lights"?
Adora: I don't know. I'm not magic.
Glimmer: Obviously. Everyone, stand back.
Bow: Uh, Glimmer? Maybe you should take it easy. We're a long way from Bright Moon. It'll be awhile until you can recharge.
Glimmer: Bow!
Adora: You have to recharge your powers?
Glimmer: Can we not talk about this in front of the Horde soldier? Now, stand back. [Grunting] [Shouting]
{Bow stands beside Adora. Glimmer squeezes her eyes shut and tosses a shiny ball of light into the air.}
Adora: Whoa. [Gasps]
Glimmer: [Groans]
Bow: Wow. Are you okay?
Glimmer: I'm fine, Bow.
{An image of a warrior princess holding a sword appears on the wall.}
Bow: Oh hey! That's you!
Adora: What? That doesn't look anything like me.
Bow: No, I mean, the other you. The scary one in the cape.
Adora: That was me?
{Adora studies the image.}
Bow: You can read that inscription, right? What's it say?
Adora: It says... "She-Ra."
{The image lights up and her eyes widen as the light radiates around the room. A hologram appears in front of them.}
[All Shouting]
Light Hope: Greetings, administrator.
Adora: What is this thing?
Light Hope: What is your query?
Bow: I think it's some kind of ancient hologram.
Light Hope: What is your query?
Bow: Uh... Hi. What is this place? How do we get out of here?
Light Hope: What is your query?
Bow: Welp. She's broken.
Glimmer: She's old. I'm surprised any of this stuff still works at all.
Light Hope: Administrator not detected. Lockdown initiated.
{A series of doors slam shut around them and the rock structure begins to crumble. Glimmer turns to the hologram.}
Glimmer: I didn't do it!
Bow: No. No. No lockdown! No lockdown! 
{The ceiling shatters.}
Bow: Adora, you gotta get it to stop!
Adora: What makes you think I can?
Light Hope: Query not recognized.
Bow: There's gotta be a password or something!
Adora: Uh, stop it! Uh, Eternia! Eternia! Give me the sword!
Glimmer: What? No!
Adora: We need the scary lady in the cape. I don't know how, but she's the key to this place, so maybe she can get us out.
Glimmer: You're a Horde soldier. I'm not giving you the sword.
[Shouting]
Adora: Eternia! Uh, cape! Uh... She-Ra!
{Glimmer links arms with Bow and Adora.}
Glimmer: Hold on!
Bow: Glimmer, no!
{They teleport out.}

Scene change
[Screaming]
Bow: Glimmer!
{Glimmer is unconscious as they freefall through the sky. Bow shoots an arrow and they land on a web.}
[Grunting]
Bow: Glimmer? Glimmer!
Glimmer: [Groans] Did it work?
Bow: [Chuckles] Yeah, it worked. Barely. Are you alright?
Glimmer: I'm fine. [Groans] I think I used too much power getting us out of there.
Bow: I don't know who could've predicted that... Oh, right. Me.
Glimmer: Bow...
Bow: Like an hour ago.
Glimmer: Bow!
Bow: Sorry. I'm just glad you're okay. No more teleporting for awhile, okay. You could really hurt yourself.
Glimmer: I'm fine, okay? Let's just get back to Bright Moon so I can recharge already. Why are you still here?
Adora: What?
Glimmer: Bow and I are hardly a crack security team. You could've escaped at any time. Why didn't you?
Adora: I just-- I wanna figure out what's happening to me, and if I go back to the Fright Zone, then I'll never know. I never knew where I came from or who my family was. Shadow Weaver said it didn't matter who I was before, that-- that I was nothing before Hordak took me in. There's always been a part of me that I don't know anything about an-- and all of this, it feels familiar somehow. I don't know how else to explain it.
{Glimmer looks at the badge on Adora's jacket and scowls. Bow puts his hand on her shoulders.}
Bow: Glimmer's mom knows more about First Ones' tech than anyone. She'll know what's going on with you and the sword for sure. So, if you want your questions answered, stick with us?
{Bow extends his hand.}
Glimmer: Let's go. There should be a village a few miles from here. They'll be able to give us a ride back to Bight Moon. We've wasted too much time already.
{Glimmer starts off.}

Scene change
{Back in the Fright Zone, Catra is with Shadow Weaver.}
Shadow Weaver: For the last time, where is Adora?
Catra: For the last time, I don't know. You think I keep her on a leash?
Shadow Weaver: I know you're lying. You two are close. She would never depart without telling you.
Catra: Then I guess she let us both down, huh?
Shadow Weaver: Have it your way. I already know where she is. We've been tracking her.
Catra: Uh, then why did you ask me?
Shadow Weaver: Because you are going to bring her back.
Catra: I don't think so. [Grunting]
{Shadow Weaver zaps Catra with electricity.}
Shadow Weaver: Your insolence will not protect her. You will do as I ask.
Catra: Oh, yeah? Or what?
Shadow Weaver: Or you will suffer the consequences in her place.

Scene change
{In the forest village, the inhabitants dance and frolic as Adora arrives.}
[chattering and laughing] 
Glimmer: Okay, the jacket comes off.
Adora: What? Why?
Glimmer: If the villagers see a Horde soldier, they'll freak out. We gotta fix all this.
{Adora removes her jacket and Glimmer offers her cape as a sash.}
Adora: I feel ridiculous.
Bow: That’s ‘cause you need something to tie it all together.
{Bow puts a flower in her hair.}
Adora: I don't like it.
Glimmer: Point is, you don't look like a Horde soldier. Just keep a low profile. We'll be in and out.

Scene change
{They enter the village.}
Adora: What is this?
Bow: It's a festival. Like a big party. You don't have parties in the Fright Zone? 
Adora: Oh, right, parties. I mean, yeah, pfft, of course. I, uh-- I don't know what that is.
Bow: Ah! 
Glimmer: Did you even hear me? I said, in and out! 
Bow: She has never been to a party before, Glimmer! This is serious.
{Bow leads Adora to a food stand. He hands her a piece of food. Adora takes a bite and her eyes light up. A villager tries to put a wreath on Glimmer's head and she swats him away. Later, musicians play as they sit at a table, and Adora stuffs food in her mouth. Glimmer shoves a plate of food over, and Adora devours it. Soon after, they pass young children playing a piñata-like game. A youth hands Adora a stick of wood and she approaches the dangling toy, wearing a fierce expression. She whacks it and cracks it open. The kids run forward to collect the innards.}
[children cheering]
{Later, a villager preforms with his hands in front of a crowd of youths. Adora watches wide-eyed behind a tree. Glimmer stands beside her.}
Bow: So, seriously? No parties ever?  What do you guys do on your birthday? 
Adora: Huh?
Bow: No birthdays?! How is your life this sad?
Adora: [gasps] What is that? 
{She points to a horse, grazing in a meadow.}
Bow: That would be a horse.
[neighs]
Adora: It's majestic.
Bow: You wanna go meet it? 
Adora: What? No! [whining] 
Bow: Come on, it's okay. See, he likes you.
{She shyly pats the animal's snout and her mouth drops open.}
Adora: [gasps] This is the best day of my life.
Glimmer: Bow.
Bow: Come on, I know you like her, too.
{Smoke billows from the village.}
[rumbling nearby]
[people screaming nearby] 
Adora: What's going on? 
{They run back, and Adora gapes as fires blaze from the village dwellings.}
Glimmer: It's the Horde!
{They hide in a hut.}
Bow: Why are they here? The people of Thaymor aren't a threat.
Adora: Wait. Did you say Thaymor? This can't be Thaymor.
Glimmer: Did you know something about this? 
Adora: No. I mean, yes. But there's a mistake. Thaymor's supposed to be a heavily fortified rebel fortress, not a civilian town!
Glimmer: Do you really think that matters to them? 
Adora: I can get them to stop. This is all a big mistake. I just need to talk to them. Get as many people out as you can and don't let them see you.
{Adora removes the sash.}
Adora: I'm sorry.
Glimmer: Adora! 
{She hurries off, sprinting pass the villagers as they scatter in fright. She stops, stunned as a Horde tank barges through a hut nearby.}

Scene change
Adora: Stop! 
{Catra exits.}
Catra: Adora! 
Adora: Catra? 
Catra: They let me drive a tank. Believe it? 
Adora: Catra, I don't understand. What are you doing here? 
Catra: Uh, duh, we came to find you. "Cover for me, Catra. No one will even  know I'm gone." Seriously, did you just get immediately captured right after you snuck out--? What are you wearing? 
Adora: Uh...
{She rips the flower from her hair.}

Scene change
{Meanwhile, the villagers flee. One trips, and Glimmer helps her up. A Horde robot arrives and an arrow pierces the front window. Glimmer turns as a Horde soldier comes up behind Bow.}
Glimmer: Bow! [shouting]
{Glimmer teleports and whacks the soldier.}
Bow: Hey!

Scene change
Adora: There's no time. We have to put a stop this.
Catra: What? Why?
Adora: Because this is a civilian town. Look around! These aren't insurgents. They're innocent people.
Catra: Yeah, sure. Innocent people who kidnapped a Horde officer. Now come on, let's get you back to the Fright Zone. Shadow Weaver is freaking out. [laughing] It'd be funny if she weren't such a terrible person.
Adora: Catra, no. I can't go back. Not until the Horde leaves this town alone. You have to help me.
Catra: What are you saying?
Adora: I’m saying, this is wrong. They've been lying to us, manipulating us. Hordak, Shadow Weaver, all of them.
Catra: Duh! Did ya just figure that out? Manipulation is Shadow Weaver's whole thing. She's been messing with our heads since we were kids.
Adora: How could you possibly be okay with that?
Catra: Because, it doesn't matter what they do. The two of us look out for each other. And soon we'll be calling the shots. Now, can we go home already?
Adora: I'm not going home, Catra. I can't. Not after everything I've seen. Come with me. You don't have to go back there. We can fix this.
{Adora takes Catra's hand. She pulls away.}
Catra: Are you kidding? You've known these people for, what, a couple of hours? And now you're just gonna throw everything away for them? Ugh. What happened to you?Adora: I don't know. But I have to do something. I'm sorry, Catra.
{Catra zaps her with electricity.}

Scene change
     
{Meanwhile, Glimmer and Bow direct the villagers.}
Bow: Ah! I think that's all of them. Glimmer, let's go!
{Horde soldiers surround them and blast at them with their weapons. They hide in a cave.}
Bow: What are we gonna do? 
Glimmer: There's nothing we can do, Bow. You're almost out of arrows and I'm almost out of magic.
Bow: You can't say that. You're Glimmer. You throw yourself into every fight, no matter how hopeless.
Glimmer: Ugh. Every decision I've made in the last day has almost gotten us killed. My mom's right, I'm not ready for this yet.
Bow: No. You are not giving up right now. I’m sorry your mom doesn't see how strong you are, but that's her loss. You can do this, Glimmer, and you don't have to do it alone.
Glimmer: You're right. We need Adora.
Bow: We do? Didn't she just sell us out to the Horde?
Glimmer: I don't think she did. We need to find her. I think she can help us. Just trust me. Okay?
{Bow and Glimmer hop on the horse.}
[horse neighing] 

Scene change
{Meanwhile, Catra stands over Adora.}
Catra: Oh, man. That was a lot stronger than I thought. Are you okay?
Adora: Catra! 
Catra: I'm sorry! It was a reflex.
Adora: Why are you doing this?
Catra: Because you left me. And if I don't bring you back, Shadow Weaver’s gonna have my head. So, enough with your weird little identity crisis and let's go home already. Or do I need to zap you again? [shrieks] 
{Glimmer and Bow arrive on horseback.}
Adora: Glimmer?
{Bow traps Catra in a web.}
Glimmer: Watch out!
{Glimmer teleports Adora.}
Catra: Adora!
{Catra knocks Bow off the horse.}

Scene change
{Adora and Glimmer reappear in a nearby clearing. Glimmer weakens in Adora's arms.}
Adora: Glimmer? What are you doing? Why did you save me? 
Glimmer: We need you. We need She-Ra. I should've given this back to you in the ruin. You could've saved us in there and I knew that. But I was stupid. And a jerk. And I almost got us killed and I'm sorry!
Adora: You're not any of those things. I'm the Horde soldier. How do you know you can trust me now?  
Glimmer: I don't. But I hope I can. I feel like maybe you're here to help us.
{Glimmer holds out the sword. A Horde robot appears. Adora takes the sword as the robot races forward.}
Adora: For the honor of Grayskull!
{A light shines as Adora transforms into the warrior princess, She-Ra. Her body is covered with a gold and white uniform, her blonde hair flows out behind her and a crown forms on her head. She-Ra tosses the sword in the air and punches her open palm. The sword lands in her hand and holds it overhead. Soon after, she slices the robot in half. She-Ra glances back at Glimmer.}

Scene change
{Meanwhile, Bow and Catra fight. Bow flings Catra off and runs to the horse. Horde robots and tanks surround him.}
Bow: It's been an honor serving beside you, Horsey.
{Catra smiles as they close in. A bright light shines and the Horde soldiers shield their eyes. She-Ra strides forward and glowing light surrounds her. She stops and pierces the ground with her sword. The ground crumbles under their feet and electricity crackles from the rocks. Bow blinks his eyes as She-Ra stands before him. She pulls her sword from the ground. A tank aims its gun at her and she leaps up and slices the weapon from the armed vehicle. The tank explodes. Catra observes wearing a grim expression. Another soldier races forward, and She-Ra stops them with her sword. A robot attacks and She-Ra grasps its legs and flings it away.}
Glimmer: Bow! Are you okay?
Bow: Is that Adora? 
Glimmer: It's She-Ra.
Horde soldier: Retreat! 
[all screaming]
{The Horde retreats. The light flickers as She-Ra morphs back into Adora. She collapses on her knees, the sword in her right hand. As the smoke clears, Catra faces Adora.}
Adora: Catra...
{Catra backs away and disappears. Bow leaps on Adora.}
Bow: You did it!
Adora: I did?
Glimmer: You saved us. You saved everyone!
Adora: [chuckles] I did it. I turned against the Horde. I turned against the Horde! Why did I do that? I can't go back now. Where am I supposed to go?
Glimmer: Hey, hey. It's okay. You're with us now. C’mon, let's go home.
{Adora smiles and takes Glimmer's hand. They walk off with their arms around each other. Bow grins.}
Bow: Best-friends squad! 
{The horse follows them.}
Bow: Wait, whose horse was this?
