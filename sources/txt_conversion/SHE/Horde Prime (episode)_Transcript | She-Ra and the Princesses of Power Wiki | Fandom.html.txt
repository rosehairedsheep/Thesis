[Etheria]
[Horde Prime's battalion of spaceships encircle Etheria's atmosphere; a control spire lands with a boom in a forested area, branches creaking and breaking under its mass; the spire's door hisses open for multiple Horde bots and drones to march/fly out; one drone scans the forest in a hum; a young Etherian runs into view followed by another, both panting fearfully; both suddenly gasp in fear and attempt to run from several drones that surround them; both girls whimper as the drones begin to scan them]
Adora: [quickly running and leaping, spinning and crashing her staff down on a drone as they scatter; shouting] For Etheria! [the drone begins to fly away, but Adora spins her staff again and impales it, making it buzz with electricity]
[The two Etherian civilians sigh in relief, then cry out in fear as another drone flies toward them; an arrow pierces and knocks down the drone]
Bow: [leaping in and landing next to Adora; confidently] Two down.
[A third drone flies upward and away before Swift Wind kicks it with a grunt, knocking it down]
Swift Wind: And a whole Galactic Horde to go.
[The drone falls and Perfuma grabs it with a vine as Frosta punches it with an ice fist, both grunting]
Mermista: [standing next to Frosta] I'll get the next one, I guess.
[Adora pulls her staff out of the first drone with a metal shing as Swift Wind lands next to the crew]
Adora: [to the Etherian civilians] It's okay, you can come out now.
[Several civilians come out of the woods to cross a river, whilst protected by the princesses, Swift Wind, and Bow; Adora looks up at a control spire just before a laser blast fires past, causing the civilians to scream]
Adora: [shouting] Run!
[A tree explodes nearby as Horde bots run toward the group; as the last of the civilians run across, Frosta gasps to follow them, Perfuma removes her vine bridge, Swift Wind neighs, and everyone except Mermista and Adora stay with the civilians]
Mermista: [quietly, confidently] My turn. [shouts with effort, throwing a huge wave of water from the river at the bots, pushing them all away except one which gets pinned against a tree]
Bow: [calling out] Come on, let's go before they-- [Adora gives a prolonged shout, running at the bot; reprimanding] --Adora!
[Adora shouts again as she leaps at the bot, grunting as she dodges its swipes; metal clangs as Adora's staff connects with the bot's arm; the bots laser arm charges and fires, Adora barely avoiding the blast and gasping; they continue to fight until Adora jabs the bot in the laser arm and electricity buzzes along its exterior until it explodes; more bots and drones rush in]
Adora: [raising her staff, shouting] For the honor of-- [looking at her staff, cutting herself off; tone falters, prolonged] Ooooh...
[Adora gasps as she barely dodges a laser blast; a bot runs in and clamps its arms onto her staff, metal clanging; Adora grunts as she is lifted into the air by the staff, then thrown into a tree]
Bow: [firing an arrow into a drone making it explode; calling out in concern] Adora!
Adora: [holding her side, slowly getting up; quickly] I'm okay! I'm okay--ow! [collapses back into the tree holding her side]
[A bot approaches her and raises its arm to attack as Adora grunts and holds her staff up in defense; a wave of water blasts the bot away, making a loud thud in the distance]
Mermista: [running up to put her hands on Adora's shoulders; reprimanding] Adora, chill. [quietly, with empathy] You're not...She-Ra anymore, remember?
Adora: [as another bot runs past; trilling with effort] I'm on iiit!
Mermista: [groaning] Ugh, I just said...
[Adora hums angrily as she runs at the bot; the bot fires and explodes nearby forest as Adora grunts and slides into its feet, knocking it down]
Adora: Gotcha!
[The bot beeps as its camera records Adora grunting and destroying the bot's feed; the scene transitions to Horde Prime's ship's throne room; Adora, shown on the monitor grunting is played back and forth a few times and paused]
Horde Prime: [sitting in his throne] Well... Who are you?
[Opening theme]

new scene
[Adora's dreams]
[Adora gasps, waking in the dream to stand in a star field shrouded in colorful mists]
Adora: [panting and walking around; quietly, wondering] ...What is this?
[Adora gasps as she holds her head, multiple flashes of memories, places, and people, most notably herself as She-Ra breaking the Sword of Protection, a portal opening, and Horde Prime; a golden figure with hair billowing and cape flapping in non-existent wind stands with their back to Adora in the star field]
Adora: [holding out her hand] What...?
[The figure looks back at Adora, eyes glowing and making everything flash white as Adora shouts fearfully]
[Adora jolts awake to sit up from her cot in a Rebellion encampment, somewhere in the Whispering Woods; Adora gasps for breath and pants, finally calming and exhaling, holding her head in her hands; she looks over at the broken shards of the Sword of Protection laying nearby and sighs; she gets up from bed and puts on her usual attire, then ties up her hair, grabs her staff, and sighs before exiting the tent, the sword shimmering and tent curtain flapping as she leaves]
[Adora walks through the camp, glancing up at where a sorcerer from Mystacor is channeling a shield spell over the encampment, magic circle humming; another sorcerer steps up to replace the first, patting them on the shoulder and making them gasp, then stepping forward and sealing a hole in the shield; Adora looks around at the people in the camp, a low murmur of conversation happening, and Sea Hawk sits nearby cleaning his sword with a leaf and then greeting Adora with a semi-salute as she passes by; Adora walks up behind Bow and Entrapta as Entrapta taps away at a tablet, making beeping noises]
Bow: [noticing Adora; concerned] Adora. Did you get any sleep? [Entrapta pulls her mask back off her face to look at Adora]
Adora: [after a slight pause] ...Have you guys finished the updates to Mara's ship yet? How soon can we take off to rescue Glimmer?
Bow: It's a little more complicated since--
Entrapta: [hair grabbing Bow's tracker pad from his hands; excitedly] SPACE! [moves away from them to spin around happily] Sorry, I'm just so excited! [alternating using her hair and hands to tap at the pad, beeping, she continues to move about erratically as she types; normal tone] In order to achieve maximum velocity for lift-off, the necessary repairs and upgrades to the shields, the engines, and the life support should take us approximately...[intakes small breath] Oh. ...A very long time. [nervously chuckles slightly]
Adora: [urgently] We don't have time. Glimmer's up there, somewhere, waiting for us. [somberly] ...We just have to figure out where.
Bow: [placing a hand on Adora's shoulder; reassuringly] We'll find her. I know we will.
Entrapta: [popping up very close to them, enunciating with her hair; excitedly] This isn't just a little update. Space has a lot more dangers and variables...[using her hair to mimic bodily positions representing her examples] crushing pressure, freezing temperatures, vaporization... All it takes is one little hull breach, and then WHOOSH! [thrusts the tablet showing a simulation of Adora and Bow dying into their faces] That's it!
[A slight pause as Adora and Bow look at each other nervously]
Entrapta: Besides, there's no telling where Glimmer could be. [uses her hair to enunciate vastness] Space is always expanding, always getting bigger and bigger! [laughs manically for a moment]
[Slight pause as Entrapta stops to look at Bow and Adora, Bow whimpering nervously and Adora looking annoyed]
Entrapta: [attempts at reassurance] ...But don't worry, I'm sure we'll determine her precise location... [unsure] soon...
[Adora sits back against a table and pinches her nose, as the sound of Mermista groaning and Frosta's voice coming from a different tent is heard--
Frosta: [upset disbelief] Are you kidding me?!]
[Adora brushes the tent flap open and the fabric rustles, revealing Mermista, Frosta, Shadow Weaver, Perfuma, the Bright Moon General, and Micah standing in front of a map]
Shadow Weaver: [frustratedly] The sorcerer's spells will only keep us hidden for so long. Then what? This is the only way. [thrusts a finger and taps Micah's chest] Your daughter understood well enough--
Micah: [swatting her hand away; angrily] You don't get to talk to me about my daughter.
Shadow Weaver: She would've never had us abandon Bright Moon... [placing a hand on the map]
Micah: [turning toward the group; frustrated] We couldn't hold Bright Moon with the Galactic Horde attacking us from overhead, we need cover!
Shadow Weaver: [also turning toward the group; aggravated] Which is precisely why we should use the Heart of Etheria!
Frosta: [as Mermista groans long and loud; annoyed] Come on!
Perfuma: [sighs exasperatedly] I can't, I just can't.
Mermista: Okay, so we're not doing that because, A) without Glimmer, and more importantly, without She-Ra [Adora glances away dejectedly] the Heart of Etheria won't work. And, B) when it did "work", it nearly destroyed everyone. So, [hums slightly] no, thanks.
Frosta: [cutting in quickly, crossing her arms; aggravated] Oh, and also, C) we don't like you, and we don't want your help.
Perfuma: [slightly confused] Also, D) ...are you still our prisoner? [looks to the rest of the group, gesturing emphatically] C--could we get a rundown of who is and who is not our prisoner anymore?
Adora: [cutting in quickly, walking to the center of the group; authoritatively] Arguing is not going to help us. We need information on Horde Prime if we're going to find Glimmer, and we won't get any of that sitting around here.
Micah: Adora's right. The best thing we can do now is focus on evacuations, scouting missions, and keeping everyone safe until we can learn more of Horde Prime's plans. [walking over to tap at the map] Our scouts report that another one of his spires has been spotted near Thaymor.
Mermista: Wait, wait, wait, didn't we just save Thaymor?
Frosta: No, you're thinking of Elberon.
Mermista: [groaning, then flopping onto a beanbag chair] Ugh, can everywhere stop getting invaded for, like, five seconds?
Adora: [confidently] I'll do it. I'll bring them back here.
Perfuma: [placing her hands on Adora's shoulders; concerned] Alone? Adora, you really ought to bring backup, you're not... [whispers softly, cupping her mouth] You-Know-Who anymore.
Adora: [slightly disgruntled] ...Fine. I'll take a team.
[Everyone but Adora and Micah begin to leave]
Micah: [placing his hands on Adora's shoulders; slowly, reasurringly] I still believe in you, Adora. You saved me...and I know...you're gonna save my little girl.
Adora: [after a slight pause; determined] ...I promise I'll find Glimmer, Your Majesty. Wherever she is... [reassuringly] we'll get her back.
[Micah smiles, slides his hands off her shoulders, and walks away; Adora looks dejectedly at the floor and pinches the bridge of her nose; Adora then heaves a sigh and begins to leave]

new scene
[Horde Prime's Ship, Glimmer's holding cell]
[Glimmer grunts and blinks awake, laying in her cell; she breathes out, realizing where she is, and she swings her legs over the side of the bed, then gets up and goes to the cell's force field door; she touches it and gasps as it ripples with a magical hiss under her touch; Glimmer clenches her fists and groans with effort, concentrating on teleporting as some sparkles shimmer around her, but an electrical buzz shorting-out sound is heard]
Glimmer: [frustrated; almost desperately] Come on... Please work. [she concentrates again and magical shimmering is heard as she intakes a breath, then she breathes out disappointedly; she bangs twice on the force field with her fists; calling out desperately, voice echoing slightly] Hey! Is anyone there? [a slight rustle can be heard] ...Someone, answer me! [She pants nervously; Catra's tail brushes and rustles around a corner in the hallway] Hello?
[Catra narrows her eyes and steps back around the corner, disappearing further into the ship]

new scene
[Etheria, in the sky above a forest near Thaymor]
[Swift Wind flies over the forest, flapping his wings and scouring the ground; he neighs overhead as Scorpia looks back at Adora who is standing and shepherding citizens into the forest, the citizens' conversations a low murmur]
Swift Wind: [landing next to Scorpia] No bots in sight. I don't want to jinx it or anything, but this is a pretty great first mission together.
Scorpia: [excitedly] I am so happy you said that, 'cause I feel the same way. We're kind of a great team, between your hooves...
Swift Wind: [quickly adding to her sentence, gesturing at her with a wing] And your pincers... [Scorpia clinks her pincers]
Scorpia: [finishing the sentence] And our positive attitude, nothing can get in our way!
Swift Wind: [laughs] Oh, uh, just so you know... [conspiratorially] I have been known to sing from time to time.
Scorpia: [bringing her claws together] What? I love singing. Catra always said it was annoying. [squeaks a slight chuckle] Man, you guys are the best!
Bow: [announcing from nearby as the last of the civilians passes by the rest of the group] That's the last of them. No bots, no drones. We're all clear.
[A child civilian gasps as they recognize Adora, and they drop their She-Ra doll on the ground; Adora's staff clinks metallically as she kneels to pick up the doll, looking at it sadly]
Adora: [looking back at the child] Wait! [her staff scrapes the ground slightly as she walks to hand the toy back to the child] Here you go.
[The child gasps lightly and looks at Adora in awe, slightly chuckling; nearby, Bow's tracker pad starts to beep frantically as Bow checks it]
Swift Wind: [As Bow puts the pad away and Adora walks toward him] Uh-oh, beeps and that look are never a good combination.
Bow: [puts on his goggles and they whir to life; the goggles beep and zoom in on three Horde Prime clones walking in their direction] We've got trouble.
[Scorpia, Bow, and Swift Wind all hide behind a nearby branch, looking out at the clones]
Swift Wind: [whispering] Is that Hordak? Three Hordaks?
Bow: [turning his goggles off and handing them to Scorpia and she turns them back on; quietly] That's not Hordak.
Scorpia: [gasps lightly; whispers] Clones.
Bow: [quietly] We need to get out of here.
Adora: [stepping out in front of them; quietly] I've got a better idea. [runs off toward the clones]
Bow: [shouting as Adora screams out while running] Wait! Adora!

new scene
[Horde Prime's ship, throne room]
[A door hisses open as Catra steps inside the throne room, looking around and stopping when she sees Horde Prime, sitting in his throne]
Catra: [haltingly, almost nervously] Excuse me, Lord...Prime. [she bows her head, then after a few moments glances back up at Prime, as voices whisper eerily and his eyes glow green] You...wanted to see me? [she steps forward and gets a closer look at Prime, grimacing at his distant stare, eyes still glowing and voices whispering; she gets even closer, leaning forward; contemplative] ...Huh.
Horde Prime: [after a pause, his eyes stop glowing and he looks down at her] Catra. [Catra hisses and jumps back] That is your name, is it not? ...I have been reviewing the memories of my defective brother. It seems he had very little love towards you at the end. [Catra looks uncomfortable; slight chuckle] Hmm. The question is... [he stands and Catra backs up slightly] what do we do with you now?
Catra: [continuing to back up as Horde Prime walks toward her] Remember that big planet-sized Etheria weapon? Well, I'm the only one who can tell you how it works. [quietly, determined] You need me.
Prime: [stepping around Catra to stand behind her, placing a hand on her shoulder] You would pledge your loyalty to me, Catra? [he tightens his grip on her shoulder and she grunts softly] What do you say?
Catra: [Prime removes his hand as Catra steps to face him; softly] ...I'm ready.

new scene
[Adora's dreamscape]
[Adora opens her eyes in her dream with a gasp; Adora pants, almost hyperventilating, as she looks around, then notices the glowing figure from before; Adora walks toward the figure, but the figure walks away from her]
Adora: [crying out] Wait!
[Adora runs after the figure, panting and reaching out; the figure erupts in blinding light]
[Scene transition to a forest; Adora, being carried, shakes her head back and forth, grunting]
Adora: [shouting and waking] NO! [she groans slightly, then notices the world is upside down, bobbing up and down around her]
Swift Wind: [happily] You're awake! [chuckles slightly] Oh, hello Adora!
Adora: [groans; groggily] What happened? [Scorpia sets her down on the ground] Where are those clones? [voice almost slurs from grogginess] Did we get 'em? [falls back on her butt with a thud]
Scorpia: [as Adora grunts to get up and then again as she falls back again] Okay, um, don't get mad, but I...may have had to sting you. Just a little.
Adora: [incredulous] What?
Scorpia: Well--you were refusing to retreat and we--we really, really needed to run away.
Swift Wind: [cutting in, shouting] Space! Clones!
Adora: [baffled, pointing at Scorpia while wobbling on the ground] You stung me?
Scorpia: I'm sorry... [picking up Adora by an arm as Adora grunts groggily] so sorry. [sternly] But I don't regret it, and will do it again if needed. [slight pause, then rubs at Adora's arm; hums apologetically] Mm, sorry, again.
Bow: [sternly] Adora. You can't run into battle like that. Not anymore. [Adora turns away from him and covers half her face with a hand] You have to stop acting like you're invincible. You aren't--
Adora: [turning back to Bow; frustrated] You don't need to say it. [quieter, resigned] I know. I made that choice, I'm living with the consequences.
Bow: What were you even trying to do?
Adora: I thought maybe I could get those clones to tell us where Glimmer is being held. Then, at least, I'd be one step closer to saving her.
Bow: [begins sternly, then finishes contemplatively, patting the back of his head] That's--not a bad idea.
Adora: Wait, what?
Bow: Trying to fight a group of clones by yourself is reckless. Catching and questioning one clone is...[shrugging] also reckless, but...this time we do it together.
[Scene transition to an Etherian town; several clones walk around the area while one goes to look out at an empty stretch of land; Adora steps into view on the clone's right side]
Adora: Hey. [tapping her staff twice on her shoulder; smugly] Ready to go again?
[The clone narrows his eyes and rushes at Adora; Swift Wind neighs as he flies in over her head and kicks the clone who grunts as he's thrown backward; Bow pops out of a nearby bush and fires a net arrow at the clone, trapping him, as Scorpia screams, pounding the clone with a blast of her electricity; the clone grunts and thuds a distance away; the clone groans as the electricity buzzes around him, closing his eyes as Adora walks closer and smiles]

new scene
[Horde Prime's ship, Glimmer's holding cell]
[Glimmer paces just in front of the force field door; she stops suddenly, walking closer to the door and staring out]
Glimmer: [shouting; determined, angrily] You can't hold me here forever! [places her hands on the door as it ripples, ringing; she pants slightly; footsteps tap out in the hallway, and Glimmer looks up to see Catra smirking as she gets closer; Glimmer sighs, slightly annoyed] ...Oh, great. You.
Catra: [tapping a claw against the field as it rings out] Pretty fancy accommodations, huh? [she crosses her arms smugly] Well...for a prisoner, that is. [tauntingly] How's it going, princess?
Glimmer: [slight scoff] Don't pretend you're any better off than I am right now. [slight intake of breath] You might be on the other side of this force field, but you're as alone as I am.
Catra: [shrugging slightly; deadpan] The Horde's the Horde...even in space. [smirking again] As long as I'm of value to Horde Prime, I've got a place in this world. I can work my way up here, just like I did before.
Glimmer: [half scoffs, half chuckles] Is that really what you want? [begins to raise her voice; frustrated] We both saw what happened to Hordak. [incredulous] Do you really think you can come out on top?
[Catra slightly hisses angrily]
Two Prime Clones: [standing behind Catra, startling her as they speak causing her to yelp and move closer to the force field by Glimmer and turn to face them; in unison] Horde Prime requests your presence as his guests for dinner this evening. ...Both of you.
[The force field closes in itself, letting Glimmer free; the clones begin to walk away, and Catra and Glimmer share a look of concerned confusion]

new scene
[Etheria, not far from the clone-invaded town]
[The clone the crew captured, tied up and sitting against a rock, grunts awake and stares at Adora, Bow, Scorpia, and Swift Wind]
Adora: [angrily] Horde Prime took my friend Glimmer, and I want her back. [swings her staff in a whoosh to point threateningly at the clone's head] Where is she?
Clone: Fear not. Your [slight chuckle on next word] friend is an honored guest of Horde Prime, [worshiping, excited tone grows more emphatic] emperor of the Galactic Horde, ruler of the known universe, regent of the seven skies-- [Adora slams the butt of her staff into the ground, metal loudly ringing out]
Adora: [angrily, quietly] I said [staff scraping on the ground slightly] where?
Clone: She is with Prime on his flagship, safe at the heart of his empire, far from your paltry world. She is chosen, basking in the light of Prime's favor...he, who brings the day, and the night--
Bow: [speaking over the clone; annoyed] Okay, we get it.
Clone: [continuing in reverence] Glory be to Horde Prime, [everyone else groans] revered one of the shining galaxies, promised one of a thousand suns--! [Scorpia clamps his lips shut with a claw; he grunts surprised, then disappointed]
Swift Wind: [groaning] Ugh, did Hordak talk this much?
Scorpia: Nah, he mainly growled and yelled, [imitating angry Hordak] "GET...OUT!" [voice goes back to normal, unimpressed] ...a lot.
Clone: [muffled laughter, intake of breath upon Scorpia releasing his lips] ...Your queen is safe...unlike your rebel friends.
Adora: What do you mean?
Clone: Horde Prime sees all. Horde Prime knows all. You can abandon Bright Moon, cloak your rebel camp in illusions, but we will find you.
[The group looks at each other nervously as a flare shoots up behind them, screeching and exploding into a purple crescent moon in the sky]
Bow: [nervously, concerned] It's from Micah--they're in trouble!
[Scene transition to the group running through the forest, flare guiding them in the sky and shining with magic; the group all slide down a decline while people from the Rebellion camp scream nearby; Mermista, Perfuma and Frosta use their elements to fight with Prime's bots, grunting and yelling with effort; Entrapta, Micah, Shadow Weaver and others run away from the fight; Entrapta stops to pick up pieces of broken bots]
Entrapta: [pausing between words until excitedly saying the last] This...is...amazing! Alien tech from a distant world!
[Micah notices a drone above Entrapta and gasps slightly, running towards her, drawing a magic circle and shouting as he throws it at the drone, making it explode; he runs to use another magic circle to cover Entrapta from the explosion as she yelps in fear and he grunts; a bot slices through the smoke produced by the explosion]
Shadow Weaver: [shouting] Micah!
[Shadow Weaver runs and throws a vial at the bot, which shatters and dissolves part of the bot on impact; Micah and Entrapta look from the bot to Shadow Weaver; Micah look surprised, then hums with a slightly disapproving frown; Micah and Entrapta share a look, then run off]
Shadow Weaver: [after the pause of them leaving; quietly] ...You're welcome.
[All three run and gasp as they stop in front of a crowd of bots blocking their way; Scorpia walks in between them all and shouts as she shoots electricity into the crowd of bots; the bots fall to the ground, buzzing electrically]
Scorpia: This way! [she and the others (Adora, Bow, and Swift Wind now also stand behind the other four) run past the bots on the ground; voice fades out as she runs further away] 'Scuse me, pardon me. Hi, hello, how are you...Watch out there!
Micah: [stopping to pull away Entrapta from picking at a bot on the ground] Come on!
[Adora also stops and turns to see more bots following them]
Bow: [stopping as well, reaching out as Adora runs off] Adora, wait--!
Adora: I can do this! [Adora shouts as she brings her staff down after a leap at the bots]

new scene
[Horde Prime's ship, dining room]
[A clone slices into a gelatinous cube on a plate, making a moist squish, and then walks it over to set it down in front of Catra on the table]
Catra: [as the clone goes to get another plate with the same gelatin to set it in front of Glimmer; quietly] Uh...thanks...
[Another clone fills up Glimmer's glass, liquid splashing; the clone steps away as Glimmer looks at Catra, who shares her look, then looks down as Horde Prime walks in and goes to his chair at the other end of the table from Glimmer]
Horde Prime: Are you comfortable, Your Majesty? [a pause as he sits and places his hands on the table; Glimmer looks on, disheveled] I strive to treat my guests well. [Glimmer glances at Catra, and Catra glances back at Prime, contemplative and eyes narrowed] I believe we can learn a great deal from one another.
[A clone places a plate in front of Prime, removing the glass lid to reveal a steaming shelled clam-like food; Glimmer and Catra nervously look down and glance cautiously at Prime; Glimmer takes a spoon and gets a small portion of the gelatin in front of her, eating it]
Prime: Ah, enjoyable, yes? It's a delicacy from a distant world, light years away from here. [A clone walks and talks a plate away from in front of Catra] It is very much like Etheria. This dish is incredibly rare, as that world no longer exists.
[Glimmer nervously looks down at her plate, hand shaking as she drops her spoon and it clatters; Glimmer covers her mouth with a hand and begins to hyperventilate a little]
Prime: Seconds?
Glimmer: [pause, then quietly reserved] ...No. Thank you.
Prime: Speaking of Etheria, you must miss it terribly. Would you like to see your home world now?
[Prime snaps his fingers, and a bot back on Etheria's eye-LCD turns into a camera, showing the Rebellion camp on fire and people crying out on monitors behind Prime; Glimmer gasps and whimpers as she sees people running and screaming, lazers zapping behind them; Mermista grunts as she splashes water on a bot, then screams out angrily as she is surrounded before the feed cuts out]
Glimmer: [hopelessly] No...
[Perfuma grunts as she commands vines, Scorpia runs and pants, and Bow grunts with effort as he tries to stand; Glimmer whimpers a half-sob as she gets up a little from her chair and Catra leans forward closer to the monitors]
Glimmer: [tears in her eyes, quietly] Why are you doing this?
Prime: Every rebellion forms around a leader...a beacon of hope...that little note of discord.
[One monitor behind him cuts out, buzzing with static, before Adora shows up on the screen and grunts almost fearfully, panting and running]
Prime: Ah, here she is... Your beacon of hope. Adora. [Catra's claws scrape against the glass table] She-Ra. A nuisance that must be purged in order to bring peace to Etheria.
[A tear rolls down Glimmer's cheek as Adora continues to pant; Adora then grunts as she uses her staff to vault-kick a bot, knocking it over, panting as she whips around and shouts as she quickly blocks a laser blast, but is knocked back, rolling, staff clattering; Adora reaches for her staff before it is knocked away by a laser blast, then gasps and looks back at three bots whirring as they approach; Adora gets up and looks around as the bots surround her; a bot raises it's laser arm and charges its laser as Adora cowers, raising her own arm as a guard]
Adora: [shouting] No!
Glimmer: [begging, desperately] Stop! Don't hurt her! [slightly hyperventilates before continuing, clones surrounding her, ready to fight] ...Y--you wanna use the weapon, right? Y-you need all the princesses, a-and that includes She-Ra! [Catra glances slowly at Prime behind her, then back at Glimmer] Without her, the Heart of Etheria is useless. You can't hurt her. [tears drip down her face]
Prime: ...Very well. [gestures his hand as the monitor behind him turns off with a low ding] This has been most illuminating. [Glimmer sobs slightly as a few clones sit bowls with more food in front of her, later a plate in front of Prime] Thank you, Glimmer. I look forward to more of our conversations. But for now, eat up.
[Glimmer sobs quietly as more tears roll down her face; Catra's spoon scrapes the plate as she picks it up, taking a bite from her gelatin before looking around and finally glancing at the monitor; she looks away, narrowing her eyes and exhaling]

new scene
[Etheria, Rebellion Camp]
[An arrow whizzes in and smashes a bot off a nearby rock in front of Adora; Scorpia shouts with effort as electricity surges through all the bots around her, and Adora looks around nervously before seeing Scorpia land on a bot in a thud, then run off; the bots buzz with electricity as Bow runs up to Adora and helps her up]
Bow: [concerned] Adora! Are you okay?
Adora: [frazzled, halfway sobbing] No... You were right, Bow, I-I can't fight them all. I'm not strong enough, I'm not She-Ra. I'm not a hero anymore, I'm just... [breathes in] me. And I can't do this alone.
Bow: [reassuring, quietly determined] But, Adora...you aren't alone. [Bow looks away at their friends, making Adora follow his gaze] You've never been.
[Mermista shouts in effort as she and Scorpia take down bots, Perfuma also grunts as she and Frosta do the same]
Bow: We've got this. [holds up his hand for Adora to take] Together.
Adora: [clasps his hand after a pause; quietly reassured] ...Together.
[Bow and Adora run toward the fight, Bow pulling out an arrow; Adora grunts as she swings her staff and pelts a bot away]
Adora: [calls out] Scorpia, coming at ya!
[Scorpia shouts as she shoots electricity at the bot, frying it; Mermista grunts nearby, a wave of water flowing at bots]
Adora: [calling out, pointing] Bow! The drone!
Bow: [yelling out] Got it! [shoots a net arrow screeching at the bot, ensnaring it before it reaches Mermista as she casts her wave at other bots in front of her]
[Frosta fires ice fists at a couple bots, then gasps as more loom over her]
Adora: [running in from behind] Frosta! Ice catapult.
[Frosta runs up to Adora and uses Adora's staff to propel herself with ice fists at the bots, yelling and taking them down in a thud; the smoke clears and the group stands confidently above a downed bot; a civilian child in camp nearby runs to be held by a parent]
Adora: We can't stay here, it isn't safe anymore.
Bow: We're kinda running out of places to hide.
Adora: [amid the low murmur of conversation, Adora gasps, remembering the magical place she saw in her dream] I think...I know where we can go.
[More drones and bots whir and run in towards them]
Adora: And we better hurry, come on!
[They all run off]

new scene
[Horde Prime's ship, Prime's dining room]
[Two clones escort Glimmer out of the room, then Catra gets up and goes to Prime]
Catra: [smugly, slight chuckle] Neat trick, with all the footage of her friends in danger. [crosses her arms and gestures one out] These princesses are so predictable with their feelings.
Prime : [gets up and moves closer to tower over Catra] As were you.
Catra: [nervously, quietly] ...What?
Prime: Elevated heart rate, dilated pupils... Adora means something to you.
Catra: [slight pause, then returns to a quietly annoyed demeanor] No. She doesn't. [looks away as her voice semi-breaks] She chose her side, I chose mine. ...She means nothing to me.
Prime: [Catra looks up again as he moves forward to lean down toward Catra, reaching out a hand toward her face] You Etherians are all alike. Such strong connections to one another. [traces a finger down her mask in a metallic scraping noise, all the way to lift up her chin at its point, making Catra gasp quietly] It's what makes you weak. [Prime removes his finger]
Catra: [quietly] ...What are you going to do with me?
Prime: [slightly more sinisterly] Now that I know about She-Ra and the weapon, what purpose do I have for you? Your little ploy of parsing out information like a bartering chip was never going to last long out here... I see all. I know all. [Catra backs up slightly after a pause at his new, more upbeat demeanor] But fear not. I have great plans for you. Every part of the machine is of value. Even you...little sister.

new scene
[Etheria, Whispering Woods]
[Adora leads the group through the woods]
Bow: Adora, where are we going?
Adora: It's around here somewhere... A place where we'll be safe. Madame Razz brought me there and I saw it again in my dreams. ...I just have to hope it lets us in.
[Adora walks up to some foliage and rustles it before a magical particle floats by, making her gasp in wonder]
Adora: [noticing a glowing between some trees] There!
[Adora touches a tree between the glowing gap, and the trees begin to rumble and shake apart, revealing a glowing and particle-filled haven; Adora runs in]
Adora: [in awe] Whoa...
[The rest of the group enters more slowly, all gasping and giving similar reactions in awe; animals call out nearby]
Micah: ...Where are we?
Adora: [breathy slight chuckle] The deepest part of the Whispering Woods... Horde Prime won't find us here; we're safe. Now we just need to set up camp and-- [a ringing noise eclipses everything else as Adora gasps and puts both hands to her head, grunting as she kneels]
Bow: [concerned, leaning down to her] Adora!
[Adora gets flashes of the planet and of the Fright Zone, then falls and braces herself on an arm; another flash comes of her as She-Ra breaking the sword, making Adora cry out in pain; more flashes of a portal, Prime's eyes glowing, and the golden silhouette from her dreams shining and eclipsing everything; Adora shouts and passes out]
Bow: [shaking her shoulder; concerned] Adora!
[The rest of the group gathers around silently, concerned]
