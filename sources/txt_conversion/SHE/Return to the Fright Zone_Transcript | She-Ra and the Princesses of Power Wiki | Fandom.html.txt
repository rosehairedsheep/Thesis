Adora: Mermista, Spinnerella, and Scorpia are wreaking havoc across Etheria. If we wanna stop Horde Prime, we have to neutralize them and figure out how to free them from their chips.{yelps}
Netossa: Leave this to me. I've been keeping track of every Princess' weakness. And I've discerned the best tactical strategy to overpower every one of them. Spinny's weakness is obvious. 
Adora: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Real obvious. And, um, ahem, what is it exactly? 
Netossa: {sighs} Everyone knows she twisted her ankle when she was a kid. If you keep her off balance, her injury will act up on her. Next time we fight, I'll target it, and subdue her and un-chip her and save her and remind her of it every time she tells me it's my turn to clean. 
Bow: Right. But could we circle back to your not-at-all-weird-and-very-detailed theories on our weaknesses? 
Glimmer: Yeah, not all of us will be as easy as a twisted ankle. 
Netossa: Oh, you don't believe me. That's--That's fine. I'll just demonstrate. Entrapta's weakness: tech.
Entrapta: {crashes} 
Netossa: Mermista's: fire. Frosta's: also fire. Adora can't act to save her life. Also, extreme hair-envy with She-Ra. Glimmer: crippling self-doubt mixed with overwhelming hubris. 
Glimmer: Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's, like, really personal compared to fire. 
Perfuma: Oh, oh, do me. Do me next. 
Netossa: Perfuma: fire. And an inability to unleash your full power due to your overwhelming fear of hurting the people you care about. 
Perfuma: Some might say that's actually a positive quality. 
Netossa: It's not. Bow's weakness...
Bow: {gasps}
[She snaps the string on his Bow.]
Bow: You've spent a lot of time thinking about this, huh? 
Netossa: Contingency plans are how you win, and I always win. 
Catra: Okay, we get it. Princesses are easy to take down. You and your files don't have anything on real threats, like me. {screaming}
[Netossa squirts Catra with water, then traps her in a net.]
{thud} 
(Theme Song)
Adora: We need to stop the chipped Princesses before they hurt anyone else. We've lost track of Spinnerella after Erelandia, but there is good news. We know where Scorpia is. Bow? {clears throat} Uh, Bow? 
Bow: Huh? Oh, uh, right. After wreaking havoc on a town along the coast, Scorpia returned to the Fright Zone. 
Perfuma: If Scorpia went back to the Fright Zone, that has to mean something. There's probably a part of her that remembers it's her home. 
Catra: That pile of junk isn't anyone's home. 
Perfuma: Scorpia saved me. She stayed behind so the rest of us could escape the Enchanted Grotto. If anyone can resist Horde Prime's programming, it's Scorpia. Her heat's too strong. She'd never hurt her friends. 
Catra: Yeah, she's not great at standing up to authority figures, trust me. 
Perfuma: Your negative vibes aren't appreciated here, Catra. 
Catra: Look, all that matters is the chip. Going for the back of the neck is how we take out Prime's clones. And the only reason that Adora, you know, saved me or whatever, is because the chip got damaged first. That's how we free them. 
Perfuma: You think you know how to save Scorpia better than I do? I know all about how you treated her back in the Horde. Things are different now. Scorpia knows the kindness of a true friend. 
[Catra's eyes widen, then she looks away.]
Catra: {grunts} 
Perfuma: Hoo. Hmph. 
Melog: {whimpers} 
Adora: Hey, we all want to save Scorpia, so, let's work together to do it. If we make our way through the desert, we can enter the Fright Zone through here. Catra, Melog, we'll need you to cloak us. 
[Glimmer looks up and spots Bow walking away from the table. Soon after, he stands outside staring at his tracker pad. Glimmer teleports beside him.]
Glimmer: Bow, are you okay? 
Bow: Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. 
{beeping}
[A light blinks on the pad.] 
Glimmer: It's your dads, isn't it? 
[He frowns.]
Bow: I know they're probably fine. The Library is really well hidden, but I haven't heard from them since we got back. 
Glimmer: We should go check on them. I'll teleport us there. 
Bow: But, what about the mission? Scorpia and the others are controlled by Prime and your dad might be with them. 
Glimmer: Bow, Adora and the others can handle Scorpia. This mission is just as important. We have to make sure your dads are safe. 
Bow: I'm really worried about them. 
[Glimmer hugs him.]
Glimmer: Then let's go. Wherever they are, we'll find them. 
[Bow smiles at her.]

[In the Fright Zone, Horde ships circle overhead and one ship scans the ground with a laser beam. Netossa, Perfuma, Adora, and Catra hide behind a giant pipe.]
Adora: It's weird, isn't it? Being back. So many memories here.
Catra: Most of them bad. 
[Catra looks at Adora. Adora is staring sadly at the Fright Zone.]
Catra: Hey, bet I can still beat you to the forge. 
Adora: Uh, because you always cheat. 
Adora & Catra: {laughing} 
[Catra races off and Adora and Melog run after her. They teleport to the forge with Netossa and Perfuma.]
Adora: Huh.
[The building is in ruins.]
Adora: Well, it's different than I remember it. 
Catra: Hordak and I may have had a small disagreement before we were taken by Horde Prime. 
Adora: Whoa. 
[They sneak further inside.]
Perfuma: Scorpia? 
Catra: What is she doing? 
Perfuma: Scorpia? 
Adora: Get back here. 
Netossa: No. Does no one understand what stealth means? 
Perfuma: Scorpia? 
[A row of round green lights flicker on and off and red streaks of electricity crackle around them.]
Catra: {sighs} Your plans are just the worst. 
{all yell} 
[A blast of light erupts behind them. When the dust settles, Scorpia appears.]
Perfuma: Scorpia? 
[She stands frozen in place.] 
Netossa: What's she doing? Why isn't she attacking?  
Perfuma: She recognizes us. I told you she'd never hurt her friends. {chuckles} Scorpia?  
[Scorpia looks up with a glare, her eyes glowing green.] 
Adora: Perfuma!  
[Adora protects Perfuma and Scorpia fires.] 
Perfuma: She must not be able to tell that it's us.  
[Scorpia's body is covered with a layer of electricity. Catra peers out at her from behind a wall.] 
Catra: Whoa.  
[Scorpia looks at her.] 
Catra: {gasps} {yells} 
[Scorpia lifts the wall and finds Catra and Melog.]  
Catra: Scorpia...uh, it's me. Look, about everything that happened...I'm really--{yells}  
[Scorpia hits her with a stream of electricity and Catra flies backwards.] 
Melog: {meows}  
Adora: Catra! 
[Melog scampers after her. Scorpia fires at Adora and Perfuma.] 
Adora: For the honor of Grayskull!  
[Adora transforms into She-Ra.] 
Netossa: Pretty sure she can tell it's us.  
Perfuma: Yes, but I mean, it's Catra. Can we really blame her?  
[Scorpia flies in the air and launches an electrical fire ball.] 
{all screeching}   
[Meanwhile, Glimmer and Bow arrive at the library in the forest.]  
Bow: Something doesn't feel right.  
Glimmer: {gasps} 
Bow: Whoa!  
[Glimmer hides him as a Horde drone hovers.]  
Bow: Prime Bots.  
[Bow hits the drone with an arrow and it crashes.] 
Bow: They're here, right by my home.  
[Glimmer teleports them inside.]  
Bow: Lance? George?  
Glimmer: Hang on. I'll check the other rooms.  
Bow: {gasps}  
[Bow finds a broken vase and picks it up.]  
Glimmer: They aren't here.  
Bow: What if Horde Prime has them? What if he chipped them?  
Glimmer: We don't know that. Maybe they went somewhere safe.  
Bow: All of Etheria is under Prime's control. They can't defend themselves. They're dads. And now they've been taken by Horde Prime.  
Glimmer: Uh, Bow? 
Bow: I should've never learned archery. I should've never left home. Then none of this would've happened.  
Glimmer: Bow!  
[They spot a note for Bow.] 
Bow: {gasps}  
Glimmer: What does it say?  
Bow: It says, "What did the First One say when they burned dinner? It was ruined."  
Glimmer: Uh, what does that mean? I don't speak dads.  
Bow: I know where they are.   
Catra: {yells}  
[In the Fright Zone, Catra crashes to the ground.] 
Catra: {groans} That could've gone better.  
Melog: {meows} 
Catra: Hey, I'm working on being a better friend. That has to count for something, right?  
Melog: {meowing}  
{pipes rattling}  
[Water spurts from the pipes around them.] 
Catra: Scorpia's not alone.  
[A wave of water rushes towards Catra and Melog. Mermista appears in the water, her eyes glowing green. In another room, She-Ra battles Scorpia.] 
Perfuma: Her positive energy is being blocked by all of Prime's negative energy. We need to--She-Ra, drop it. Drop it. We don't throw tanks at our friends.  
She-Ra: Yeah, well, this isn't working. Look at her. It's like she doesn't even recognize us.  
[Scorpia blasts at She-Ra.] 
Netossa: Perfuma, enough with the feelings. You could be one of the strongest Princesses if you'd just-- 
Perfuma: I am strong! But I'm not gonna hurt my friend.  
She-Ra: Oh, I really wish she'd stop doing that.  
Perfuma: Scorpia, please stop. You don't have to do this anymore.  
[Perfuma walks towards Scorpia and vines and pink flowers bloom around her feet. Vines sneak around Scorpia's legs and around her torso. She looks down as vines incircle her claws and a pink flower blooms. Scorpia stares at the blossom and Perfuma looks hopeful.] 
Perfuma: {yelps} 
[Scorpia snaps the vines and swings at Perfuma.] 
Perfuma: {yells}  
[She-Ra protects Perfuma. She-Ra's sword transforms into a long golden lasso as she swings it and wraps it around Scorpia. Scorpia falls to the ground and their eyes meet. Then, Scorpia breaks free. She-Ra falls and her sword flickers. Netossa steps forward.] 
Spinnerella: Still trying to save everyone? What a wasted effort.  
[Spinnerella appears behind her.] 
Netossa: This one's mine.  
Perfuma: Netossa, wait.  
She-Ra: Oh, so, she gets to throw tanks at us.  
[Scorpia hurls a tank.]  
Glimmer: Oh, "It's ruined." I get it. {chuckles} That's...terrible. Why do you think they came here?  
Bow: They were excavating it, looking for First Ones artifacts. It would've been the last safe place to go.  
[They duck as an arrow flies at them.]  
Bow & Glimmer: {gasp}  
[Two men appear.] 
Lance: Bow? Oh, Bow! Oh, and Glimmer. We didn't hit you, did we? Sorry. We're so sorry.  
George: I'm still teaching him how to use this thing. And I don't know how to use it either. So, um, it's good you're here.  
Lance: You got our message.  
George: {chuckles} I knew you'd "pun-derstand."  
Bow: You will not distract me with puns right now. I've been so worried. You haven't responded to any of my messages.  
Lance: Our tracker pad's been on the fritz. And you know we're useless with that kind of thing. We left a note.  
Bow: You can't just work on ancient history like nothing's happening.  
George: You were the one who inspired us to fight for what we believe in. We're not hiding down here. We found something. Something that we think might help everyone.  
Glimmer: What did you find?  
Lance: It's easier if we show you. Come on.  
[They follow Bow's dads.]  
[In the Fright Zone, Mermista looks around a hallway and Catra leaps at her.] 
Mermista: {yelps} Hiding is pointless.  
[Catra whacks her and Mermista sprays water.] 
Mermista: Show yourself and kneel before Horde Prime's might.  
Catra: Not a chance.  
[Catra eyes the chip embedded in Mermista's neck. Mermista knocks Catra with water and Melog hurries to Catra's side. They flee.] 
Catra: {coughing}  
[On the roof, Netossa battles Spinnerella.] 
Netossa: You're not going anywhere.  
Spinnerella: Oh, but you are.  
[Spinnerella spins Netossa around and Netossa slips over the side of the building. Spinnerella looks down and Netossa sits in a net.] 
Netossa: {yells} You can't get rid of me that easily.   
[She-Ra and Perfuma escape on a path of vines.] 
Perfuma: How can Prime do this? Scorpia was so full of light and kindness. And he stripped that away. He--He erased her. He erased our friendship. {crying} 
[She-Ra comforts her and the room glows red and the device flickers and turns bright red.] 
Perfuma & She-Ra: {gasp}  
She-Ra: Oh no.  
[Scorpia hovers over them. Scorpia bashes She-Ra and she transforms back into Adora.] 
Perfuma: {screams} 
Adora: {groans}  
Perfuma: {screams} Scorpia, please. We're trying to help you.  
[Adora looks at her shaking hands as Perfuma holds back Scorpia. She spots an opening.] 
Adora: Come on.  
[They run through a tunnel.] 
Perfuma: Adora, what happened to She-Ra?  
Adora: I--I don't know, I just--I lost her.  
[The door slams shut behind them and a series of doors slam closed in front of them. They run down the side pathway.] 
Adora: Come on, Sword.  
[They reach a dark chamber and glance back.] 
Adora & Perfuma: {gasp}  
[The steps to Hordak's throne light up and Horde Prime is on it.] 
Horde Prime: Ah, She-Ra.  
Perfuma: Anytime She-Ra wants to come back, that would be great.  
Adora: You. What are you doing here?  
[Adora and Perfuma back away. The room flickers red, and then Scorpia appears and binds Adora and Perfuma in electrical wires.] 
Horde Prime: It was long past time that I saw for myself what made Etheria so very special. Starting with my brother's amusing little stronghold.  
Adora: I told you before, you're not getting She-Ra.  
Horde Prime: Oh, my sweet child, I have no need for you. Not anymore. My little brother's research has given me everything I need to know. The technology of this planet is familiar to me. Ancient, crude, outdated. It will be child's play to bypass its defenses and take the weapon at its heart for myself, with...or without you.   
George: We unearthed an ancient secret, long forgotten. A rebellion from the time of the First Ones, fighting against a powerful tyrant, just like we are. Watch. Eternia.  
Light Hope: Greetings, administrator. What is your query?  
Bow: Uh, that's cool, Dad, but we met her a while ago. She, uh, wasn't that helpful.  
Lance: Oh, that's not it. We found something hidden in her programming.  
George: For the honor of-- 
Lance: Let me do it this time.  
George: You always get to do it. 
Lance: I don't. You did it last time.  
George: Okay, fine.  
Lance: For the honor of Grayskull! Oh, I love doing that.  
George: Your voice is amazing. 
Lance: Oh, thank you.  
[A glowing blue orb appears around them.] 
Bow: {gasps}  
[Shapes and symbols float around the image.] 
Glimmer: Wow.  
George: We weren't sure what to think when we first found this. We thought it must be a glitch. 
Lance: But then we remembered that message on your tracker pad and how it used coded language based on the star formations of the distant past.  
George: "Friend of..."  
Lance: Uh, not that one. It's just-- 
George: I've got it."Mara." There.  
[They shield their eyes from the light and the hologram reappears.] 
Light Hope: Greetings, friends of Mara.  
Glimmer: Mara.  
Lance: Mara wasn't alone. She was working with a group of rebels going against their First One's leaders.  
Light Hope: There is one recording available. Would you like to review?  
Lance: Play it.  
Serenia: This is our last transmission. If anyone's hearing this, you need to listen. There's a fail-safe for the Heart of Etheria. It will allow you to destroy the Heart and end this for good. It's at the Arxia outpost, but we lost touch with them a week ago. If there's anyone left out there, you need to find it. Mara bought us time, but it's too late for us. This is Rebel Squadron Grayskull. And for the last time, we're signing off.  
[The hologram vanishes and Bow and Gimmer are wide-eyed.] 
Bow: A fail-safe. There's a fail-safe to destroy the Heart of Etheria. This could stop Prime from using the Heart. This could save the universe.  
Glimmer: They said it's at Arxia? What is that?  
Lance: That's what we don't know. The First Ones had different names for everything on Etheria. But in all our studies, we've never heard of a place called Arxia.  
Bow: We have to tell Adora. If there's a fail-safe out there somewhere, we need to find it.  
{tablet rings}  
Catra: {gasping}  
[Catra messages Bow.] 
Bow: Whoa. Are you okay? 
Catra: Get us out of here, now.  
Glimmer: What's going on?  
Catra: This whole thing was a trap. {screams} Why did I get the Water Princess? {screams}  
[Glimmer teleports.]  
Adora: {grunts} You're lying. You will never get your hands on the Heart of Etheria.  
Horde Prime: It is over, Adora. You will not be able to stop me. As always, your childish fixation on saving your friends has distracted you. It has made you vulnerable, weak.  
Perfuma: You're wrong. There's power, real power, in love, joy, and friendship.  
Horde Prime: And what could you possibly know about real power?  
[Perfuma narrows her eyes and scowls.] 
Perfuma: Friendship isn't a weakness. It's my greatest strength. And it's Scorpia's, too.  
Horde Prime: I've heard enough. End this now.  
Perfuma: Scorpia, you can break through this. I know you can.  
[Scorpia strides towards Adora and Perfuma. Perfuma begins to cry and drops to her knees. Scorpia raises her claw in the air and tears stream down Perfuma's face. Scorpia stops and punches the floor with her claw. Horde Prime turns around. Her approaches Scorpia. As the dust settles, he notices that the wires are severed and Adora and Perfuma are gone.] 
Horde Prime: {growls} Submit yourself to inspection.  
[Scorpia stares at a flower on the floor and a slight smile crosses her lips. She stands in front of Horde Prime and kneels. He inspects the chip in her neck.] 
Horde Prime: No matter. They are insignificant. The plan is under way and the Heart will soon be in my grasp.   
Netossa: {yells}  
[Netossa kicks Spinnerella.] 
Spinnerella: It's almost over. Let go. Give in to Horde Prime's will.  
[Green tears stream from Spinnerella's green eyes. Netossa kicks her again and Spinnerella falls on her hands and knees. Netossa watches her. Spinnerella rises and Netossa traps her in a net.] 
Netossa: Don't you get it, Spinny? I'm never letting you go. Because Spinny, you're my weakness.  
[She embraces her, then punches the chip in her neck.] 
Spinnerella: {yells} 
[Spinnerella's eyes return to normal. Glimmer appears beside them. Netossa looks up at Glimmer. Glimmer teleports them all to a room with Adora, Catra, Melog, and Perfuma.]  
Perfuma: {gasps}  
Netossa: I got her.  
[Adora crouches beside them. Perfuma sits cross-legged on the floor with her eyes closed. Catra approaches her.] 
Melog: {mews}  
Catra: So, I heard Scorpia dropped a beam on you.  
Perfuma: Scorpia missed. She missed on purpose.  
Catra: How do you know?  
Perfuma: I know because I believe in Scorpia.  
Catra: I hope you're right.  
[Catra sits with a frown on her face.] 
Catra: Scorpia's really lucky to have a friend like you.  
[Perfuma smiles at Catra.] 
Perfuma: It's hard keeping your heart open. It makes you vulnerable. But it doesn't make you weak, and I have to believe it's worth it.  
[Perfuma gazes into Catra's eyes. Catra glances back at Adora. Perfuma throws her arms around Catra.] 
Perfuma: {giggles} If you want, we can work through some guided meditation to begin to unblock your abandonment issues and you negativity.  
Catra: Nah. Uh-uh. No, one thing at a time, okay?   
Adora: A fail-safe. There's a fail-safe for the Heart of Etheria. Mara did it. This could work. We can still save everyone. We can stop the Heart of Etheria for good. Do we know what it is? Or where it is?  
Bow: All we know is that it's supposed to be in some place called Arxia. Other than that...we've got nothing.  
Shadow Weaver: We know where it is.  
[Shadow Weaver and Castaspella enter the room. Catra scowls.] 
Shadow Weaver: We have to go to Mystacor.
