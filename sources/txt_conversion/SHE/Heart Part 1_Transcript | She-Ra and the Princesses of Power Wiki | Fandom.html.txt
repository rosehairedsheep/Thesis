[Inside of the shelter in Etheria, Wrong Hordak watches Entrapta as she works on her computer.]
{chattering}
[Netossa and Spinnerella snuggle.]
[Perfuma puts flowers in Frosta's hair and Sea Hawk talks to Castaspella. Adora stands alone, gazing into a mirror. She touches the glowing symbol on her chest and ties her hair back in a ponytail. She extends her arm and tries to make her sword appear. She squeezes her eyes shut.]
Adora: {winces} {gasps}
[Adora transforms into She-Ra.] 
(quietly) Perfuma: These flowers really bring out the color in your eyes.
Swift Wind: Bow, could you stop playing that thing? 
Bow: Hey, I'm still learning.
Glimmer: Well, I like it. 
Bow: Hey...
[She-Ra faces them.]
She-Ra: Prime is getting closer every day to figuring out how to access the Heart of Etheria. If he succeeds, he can use it to destroy worlds, galaxies, maybe even the entire universe. The Failsafe is our only chance at stopping him. But Prime still has our friends. His hold over them grows stronger every day they're chipped. If we don't free them now, we might lose them forever. Prime holds every advantage in this fight. He'll be ready for us. But we have a plan. Entrapta? 
Entrapta: I finally succeeded in cracking Prime's signal pattern. If I get access to his Spire network, I can use it to broadcast a jamming frequency that will disable all of the chips on Etheria, freeing everyone at once! 
She-Ra: I need you all to get Entrapta to the Spire and keep Prime's forces distracted while she jams the signal. I'm gonna take the Failsafe to the Heart and destroy it, once and for all. We're going to make sure that Prime can never hurt anyone ever again. We're ending this today. For good. 
{all cheering} 
Entrapta: Yeah! 
{off in the distance, Ah,oh my goodness, Ha-cha! Friendship!}
[Off in the distance, She-Ra spots Shadow Weaver standing alone. The others celebrate and She-Ra's image flickers.]
{chattering}
[She runs outside, and Glimmer glances back. Outside the shelter, She-Ra turns back into Adora. She looks at the dark forest, wearing a sad expression on her face.]
Adora: Oh. 
Bow: You weren't trying to sneak out without us, were you? 
Glimmer: Any sign of Catra?
Adora: She's not coming back. Are you sure you guys should come? We don't know what to expect from the Heart of Etheria. It could be dangerous for you.
Bow: There's no way we're letting you do this on your own. Whatever we find, we fix this together.  
[They embrace, and Adora smiles, then closes her eyes.] 
Adora: For the honor of Grayskull!  
(Theme Song) 
[She-Ra, Bow, and Glimmer enter the Crystal Castle.] 
{automated voice speaking disjointedly}  
Light Hope: Warning. Planetary facilitator Light Hope protocol offline. Manual administrator access not recommended at this time.  
She-Ra: We're friends of Mara. Now show us where the Heart of Etheria is.  
[The holographic image scans She-Ra.] 
Light Hope: Welcome, friends of Mara.  
[The symbol glows, then an opening appears. Bow and Glimmer hold She-Ra's hands and they smile at each other. She-Ra glances back as they enter together.]  
[Catra rides Melog through the forest. Melog stops, tossing her to the ground.] 
Melog: {grunts}  
Catra: {yells} Ow! What's wrong with you?!  
Melog: {mews} 
Catra: Stop it! Stop it! I told you, I'm not going back.  
Melog: {growling}  
[Melog pins her to the ground.] 
Catra: {grunting} You saw what happened! Adora chose Shadow Weaver, okay? Not me! Adora doesn't want me! Not like I want her.  
[Her eyes brim with tears and Melog licks her cheek. She hugs Melog.] 
{footsteps approaching}  
[Melog turns them invisible as a clone passes. Still invisible, Catra follows the clone. Horde ships hover in the sky over the site and a Horde Spire perches on the dirt, surrounded by clones.] 
{wind whooshing} 
[A purple cyclone rises off the ground and Spinnerella fires at the clones. The clones return fire as Frosta, Netossa, Perfuma, Sea Hawk, and Castaspella emerge from the wind and battle the enemies.] 
Frosta: Hey, bot-faces! Come and get us!  
[Netossa eyes Spinnerellla.] 
Netossa: {chuckles} Plenty for both of us.  
[They run into battle as clones fire.] 
Wrong Hordak: Brothers. It is I, a faithful acolyte of Horde Prime, just like you.  
[Wrong Hordak shoves them and Swift Wind kicks them.] 
Swift Wind: {whinnies} 
Entrapta: Nice work, Wrong Hordak.  
[Wrong Hordak winks as Entrapta runs inside. Netossa swings a net, knocking down a clone and Spinnerella blasts away Horde ships with blasts of wind. Castaspella casts magic spells and downs clones and their ships.] 
Castaspella: {chukcles} Oh! This is so exciting!  
Sea Hawk: Perforation!  
Perfuma: We have to keep their attention on us until Entrapta can finish.  
[Entrapta hides inside and dodges a clone.] 
Entrapta: {yelps}  
[She finds the control room.] 
Entrapta: {gasps} Wow.  
[She eyes a towering control panel and sets up her computer equipment.] 
Entrapta: Okay, Entrapta, you got this. You got this.   
[At the Crystal Castle, She-Ra walks down a hallway. Glimmer looks at her sadly.] 
Glimmer: Are you scared?  
She-Ra: No. I just really hope this works.  
Bow: It's okay, Adora. We'll be with you the whole way. When we get back, it'll be a whole new world.  
{Catra laughing in the distance}  
She-Ra: Did you guys hear that?  
Glimmer: What? 
{Catra continues laughing} 
She-Ra: Catra?  
[She-Ra spots Catra.] 
Catra: Hey, Adora.  
She-Ra: Catra, you came-- 
Bow: Adora!  
[They room changes and Catra becomes a younger girl, then her current self walking on Prime's ship, Mara's ship, then the Fright Zone. Catra faces She-Ra and cups her face and the women press their foreheads together. Catra disappears and She-Ra is in the Crystal Castle again.] 
Bow: You're going the wrong way. The trail is back there. You okay? 
She-Ra: We need to be careful. It looks like this place can still project memories. We can't let it distract us.  
[She strides past her friends.]  
[In the forest, Catra trails the clone. She spots symbols in the dirt, then looks up in horror.] 
Catra: What?  
[The clone walks into a Horde camp. A huge green triangular blade hangs in a structure pointing down at the ground as clones stand guard. Beneath the probe, a purple light shines from a cluster of crystals buried underground.] 
{voices whispering indistinctly}  
Clone: {winces}  
[The clone lowers the hood, revealing the chip in his neck. He glances back, but Catra is hidden. He continues on, and Catra trembles in fear.]  
[On Prime's ship, Horde Prime addresses his troops.] 
Horde Prime: My brothers. The time has come at last. No longer shall She-Ra stand in my way. The Heart shall be laid bare, its power mine for the taking.  
Clones: Cast out the shadows. Bring the universe to Prime's light. Cast out the shadows. Bring the universe to Prime's light. Cast out the shadows. Bring the universe to Prime's light.  
Horde Prime: Begin the acquisition process.  
[He presses the Horde symbol on his screen and it flashes. A green light beams over the camp and Catra startles.] 
Catra: {gasps}  
[The green probe lowers towards the ground. Clone guards stand on a circular wall surrounding the sight. Prime presses the symbol again and the blade begins to whirl and lower towards the purple crystals. A bright florescent green light emanates from the ground and spreads over the camp. Aboard the ship, tubes run into Prime's body and he raises his arms as an image of the planet glows with green light. Catra watches as green light symbols spread over the ground and through the forest.] 
Catra: Adora. We have to warn Adora!  
[She rides off on Melog.]  
Glimmer: Adora? 
Bow: Adora!  
[Adora's eyes dart around and her image flickers. She is standing in the forest, her sword nearby, tangled in a heap of vines.] 
She-Ra: {gasps}  
Bow: Adora!  
[She touches her chest.] 
Bow: Adora, are you okay? 
Glimmer: What's going on?  
She-Ra: I think I know. This place is responding to my memories. I think I'm doing this.  
Bow: So, why here? And how do we get out?  
She-Ra: When I broke the Sword, I thought...I thought I could make my own destiny. But I can't. It was always going to end like this.  
Glimmer: What do you mean, "end"? Adora!  
She-Ra: I'm losing her. I'm distracted and confused, and I'm scared. And I can't be any of those things if this is going to work.  
[She weeps.] 
She-Ra: I need to go the rest of the way by myself.  
Bow: Adora, no! You don't have to do this!  
She-Ra: I love you guys so much. I never could have done any of this without you. Thank you for being the best friends anyone could ask for.  
Gimmer: Adora! 
[She grips the sword and light flashes. Glimmer and Bow shield their eyes and She-Ra is gone. The forest transforms back into the Crystal Castle. Bow and Glimmer embrace, tears streaming down their faces.] 
{rumbling}  
[Symbols glow on the walls.]  
[At the shelter, Catra finds Shadow Weaver.] 
Catra: {panting} Adora! Adora!  
Shadow Weaver: She's not here.  
Catra: What do you mean, she's not here? Where is she?  
Shadow Weaver: She's gone to the Heart of Etheria to free the magic and become the hero she was born to be. If you are still so selfish as to try and stop-- 
Catra: Enough! This isn't about you and your messed-up power trip anymore. Prime is doing something to the planet. He's infecting it. He's going for the Heart.   
[The green light swirls.] 
Clone: The last of Etheria's security protocols have been breached, Lord Prime. Planetary acquisition is at 20 percent.  
Horde Prime: {laughing maniaclly}   
[Entrapta works on her computer.] 
Entrapta: Oh...Almost. {yelps}  
[She disappears in a flash of green light and lands on Horde Prime's ship.] 
Horde Prime: Welcome, little rebel. You're just in time to witness the end of your world.   
[Netossa and Spinnerella battle Horde clones. Beams of green light shine down, releasing dozens of guards on the ground and perched on hilltops. The Princesses are surrounded.] 
Frosta: Why aren't they shooting?  
[Water covers the ground.] 
Perfuma: Oh, no.  
{all scream} 
[Red zaps of strike them and they collapse in the water. Behind them, Scorpia has her pincers dipped in the water and Mermista is beside her. Perfuma's eyes flutter as she tries to focus. A giant holographic image of Horde Prime rises up in the sky.] 
Horde Prime: Rejoice, Etheria, for your day of reckoning has come. I offered you mercy. But you have spurned my good graces. So be it. 
Entrapta: {screams}  
Perfuma: Entrapta!  
Entrapta: I'm sorry.  
Horde Prime: Your resistance has been for naught. Your She-Ra has abandoned you. All that is left for your world is a terrible and eternal night.  
Catra: Take us to Adora. Now!  
Shadow Weaver: She's too far away by now. We'd never reach her in time.  
Catra: No. Use your magic. I know you have more power than you're letting on.  
Shadow Weaver: It doesn't work that way, Catra!  
Catra: You've done it before! When you abandoned me in the Fright Zone. And you've always been able to track us our whole lives. So, do something good with it and help me save Adora before it's too late!  
[Shadow Weaver reaches into her robe pocket and pulls out a little jar. She extends her hand to Catra.] 
Shadow Weaver: Come here.  
[Catra takes her hand.]  
Glimmer: Adora! Adora!  
[A purple circle glows on the floor and Shadow Weaver and Catra appear.] 
Shadow Weaver: {groans}  
Bow: Catra?  
Catra: Where's Adora? 
Glimmer: She...She left us. She's headed to the Heart on her own.  
Catra: Of course she's gone! That's what she does, isn't it?  
{rumbling}  
Bow: Catra, what is going on?   
Catra: Horde Prime is onto you. He's hacking into the planet. All of this is from him.    
Bow: He's gonna take the Heart.   
Catra: That's not all. He's got Entrapta.    
Bow: If Prime has Entrapta, that means the other princesses are still chipped. We have to get back up there.   
Glimmer: We can't just leave Adora!    
Catra: I'll stay. I'll find her.    
Glimmer: Catra...   
Catra: I can't lose her again, okay? I promised her a long time ago that I'd look out for her. It's time I made good on that.    
[Glimmer smiles and embraces Catra.]   
Glimmer: Take care of her, Horde scum.    
Catra: That's the plan, Sparkles. And good luck.    
Bow: The four of us don't need luck. We're the Best Friend Squad.    
[Catra grins and pets Melog.]   
Melog: {meows}    
Catra: Get them there safe, okay?    
[Melog circles around Glimmer and Bow.]   
Melog: {meows}    
[They teleport to the Horde camp.]    
Bow: Go help the Princesses! I'll handle the signal. {grunts}   
[Glimmer hugs him.]   
Glimmer: Bow...I love you. I love you.    
Bow: I love you, too.    
[He kisses her forehead.]   
Bow: Be careful, okay?    
Glimmer: Me? I'm always careful.    
Bow: {whistles}    
[Bow and Melog run off and Glimmer turns around. She teleports away.]      
[Meanwhile, She-Ra opens her eyes. She stands, overlooking a lush green valley in Etheria. As light shimmers, another warrior princess appears beside her. It is Mara. Adora looks at her.]   
Adora: I'm going to save Etheria, no matter what it takes. Your sacrifice won't be in vain. I promise.    
Mara: But at what cost? I never wanted to die. I sacrificed myself so you would never have to. Why are you doing this, Adora?    
Adora: It's better this way. My friends will be safe. They'll be happy.   
Mara: And you? What do you want when this is all over?    
Adora: I...It doesn't matter. I'm She-Ra. This is what I'm supposed to do.    
[The image flickers and Mara takes her hands.]    
Mara: You're worth more than what you can give to other people. You deserve love, too. You're so close, Adora. Don't give up yet.    
Adora: Mara? What's--?    
[Horde Prime appears.]   
Horde Prime: Ah. Adora. So, this is where you've run to hide.       
[Meanwhile, Mermista and Scorpia battle the Princesses. Mermista blasts water and Scorpia fires electric shocks. Netossa shields herself with a net and Perfuma blocks herself with greenery. Swift Wind is knocked down. Spinnerella blasts clones with gusts of wind and Frosta repels the clones fiery lasers with sheets of ice.]   
Perfuma: There's too many! We have to retreat!    
Netossa: Retreat where? We're totally surrounded.    
[Glimmer arrives overhead.]   
Glimmer: {yells}    
[She pounds the ground and levels the clones. Her friends are stunned.]   
Glimmer: {scoffs}   
Frosta: {laughing} Yeah!   
Glimmer: Miss me?    
Frosta: Yes, but also, behind you!    
[A giant wave cascades behind them and Mermista sends the water flowing over the camp. Glimmer waves her hands in the air and casts a spell. She creates a huge pink ball of energy that shields the Princesses but the clones are washed away in the water. Castaspella helps Glimmer and they gather the water into a giant bubble and hurl it away. The water bubble knocks Mermista down.]   
Sea Hawk: Mermista. Horde Prime thinks he controls you. But I know you. And I'm gonna prove it to you with the power of shanty! Oh--Whoa! Downward!    
[Mermista fires water at Sea Hawk and he dives behind boulders.]   
Sea Hawk: {yelling} You know, this is actually kind of nice. Doesn't it remind you of the first time we met? You also tried to kill me then. {yelping}   
[He runs as she blasts water.]   
Sea Hawk: {chuckles} {yelping}   
[She knocks him to the ground.]   
Sea Hawk: {groans, then gasps} Couldn't wait to sweep me off my feet?    
Mermista: {growls} Why are you like this?    
Sea Hawk: Because I love you, dearest. And also, it's a good distraction.    
[Perfuma shoves Mermista into Sea Hawk's arms and her chip crackles.]   
Sea Hawk: Please forgive me for that when you're back to normal.    
Frosta: Uh, guys? Did anyone see where Scorpia went?       
[Bow and Melog burst onto Prime's ship. Bow quickly fires arrows, hitting two clones. They enter the control room and Bow spots Entrapta's computer equipment. They run towards it and Scorpia appears behind them. Outside, Glimmer looks at the base.]   
Glimmer: I'm gonna help Bow with the signal. Aunt Casta, can you--? {gasps}    
[She turns around to find Castaspella frozen in place. Her image in shadow and her mouth open in fear. A blackness seeps over the ground and Glimmer teleports away. She looks back to see Sea Hawk and the Princesses frozen in shadow as well. A purple and black smoke rises from the ground and Micah appears.]   
Micah: Hello, baby girl.       
[Prime approaches Adora and Mara.]   
Adora: You're not here. You can't stop me.    
[He passes through Adora.]   
Horde Prime: How strange. I must have fought her, must have known her face. But I have no memory of it.    
{creature shrieking}    
Horde Prime: I've seen so many like her over the years. One by one, all their faces have been lost to oblivion. Just as yours will be.    
{creature shrieking}    
She-Ra: {yelps}   
[A claw in the forest slashes She-Ra in the side.]   
She-Ra: {screaming}    
[She transforms to Adora and drops to her knees.]   
Horde Prime: A parting gift from the First Ones. Their old security system. Capable of taking out even one as strong as She-Ra. You will never make it to the Heart, Adora. Your own people made sure of that. Goodbye, my oldest enemy.    
[Prime vanishes and a tentacle beast rears up in front of Adora.]
