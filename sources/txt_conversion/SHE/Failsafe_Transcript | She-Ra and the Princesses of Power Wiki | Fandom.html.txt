Bow: So, wait, hold on. Where have you two been this whole time again?
Shadow Weaver: While you were traipsing around in space, some of us have been working to stop the Heart of Etheria from falling into Prime's hands. And we discovered the same thing you did. Rumors of a Failsafe that will break the restraints the First Ones built and set the stolen magic free. 
Glimmer: Are you kidding? After everything that happened last time, you're still going after the Heart of Etheria? And you're helping her? 
Castaspella: We're trying to free the magic for all of Etheria so we can be strong enough to fight Prime. I'm doing this for your father and for you. Shadow Weaver is the lesser of two evils. 
Catra: At least you admit she's evil.
Melog: {growls} 
Shadow Weaver: You're one to talk, aren't you? 
[Catra and Melog scowl and Adora calms them.]
Catra & Melog: {growl}
Adora: Tell us what you know about the Failsafe. What makes you think it's in Mystacor? 
Shadow Weaver: As any good sorcerer knows, Mystacor was built on the ruins of an ancient First Ones citadel. And beneath Mystacor--
Castaspella: Ooh, ooh. Can I tell this part? 
Shadow Weaver: Go ahead. 
Castaspella: Beneath Mystacor, there are many secret tunnels and rooms, forgotten and sealed off. No one has been able to access them in centuries, but there are whispers of what they contain. 
Shadow Weaver: An artifact known as the Crystal of Arxia, hidden there by a group of traitorous First Ones. 
Castaspella: You said I could do it! 
Shadow Weaver: You were taking too long. 
Bow: Arxia. That must be the outpost that Mara's rebels were talking about! The Failsafe might be underneath Mystacor! 
Shadow Weaver: Reaching it won't be easy. But I have spent my whole life studying the secrets of Mystacor. I can get us in. 
Adora: If you figured it out on your own, why come back here? Why do you need us at all? 
Shadow Weaver: Because Mystacor is controlled by Micah, who, you may recall, is controlled by Horde Prime. You have allowed Prime to take too much ground. If he seizes the Heart, it will all be over. There is no more time for half measures, Adora. You must act now. 
[Adora brushes off Shadow Weaver's hand.]
Adora: It's the only lead we have. We have to try. It'll have to be a stealth mission. Catra, do you think you and Melog can--?
[They are gone.]
Shadow Weaver: Oh, leave her to sulk. We can't let her slow us down. 
Adora: You guys get ready. I'll find her. 
(Theme Song)
Adora: Catra. Are you coming with us to Mystacor? 
Catra: Why would I do that? Seems like you and Shadow Weaver have it handled. 
[Adora sits beside her.]
Catra: {sighs} After everything she's done to us, you're really going to follow her? 
Adora: I don't like it either, but this is the only plan we have. The Failsafe could finally save Etheria. 
[Catra rolls away from Adora.]
Adora: Shadow Weaver hurt us. I haven't forgotten that. But Prime is hurting so many more people. I need to stop him, Catra. 
Catra: I know, I know. You have to go save the world. Spare me the speech. 
Adora: Hey, she can't do anything to us anymore. Please, come. We--I could really use your help. 
[Adora touches Catra's shoulder and Catra's eyes widen.]
Catra: Fine. But I'm only doing this to make sure Shadow Weaver doesn't try anything. Not because I like you. 
[Melog topples Adora.]
Melog: {purrs}
Adora: {yelps} 
[Adora strokes Melog's chin and Catra grins. Meanwhile, Netossa sits at Spinnerella's bedside and they both wave as Bow passes. Entrapta grabs Bow.]
Entrapta: Bow! I need to talk to you!
Bow: {yelps} 
Entrapta: I was finally able to remove Spinnerella's chip, but it was a lot more difficult than removing Catra's. The chip had almost entirely fused to her nervous system. If we'd waited any longer, I'm not sure we would've been able to get it off at all. The chip would've become a part of her.  
Bow: That means we're running out of time to save everyone else.  
Entrapta: Yes. Luckily, I've got an idea. This is the network that connects all the chips to Prime's hivemind. If I can just figure out how to crack his signal pattern, I could disrupt it, severing his connection to the chips and taking them all offline at once!  
Bow: That's amazing! We could free everyone on Etheria! You're a genius, Entrapta. Just keep working on it until you get it. We'll be back later tonight.  
Entrapta: You got it!  
[He walks away and Entrapta works on her computer.]  
[Glimmer teleports Melog, Catra, Adora, Bow, Castaspella, and Shadow Weaver to the entrance of Mystacor. Melog turns the group invisible and they cross the grounds in a pack. A sorceress with long gray hair wearing a purple robe walks past.] 
{voices whispering indistinctly}  
[She stops as they creep up behind her, gripping a staff with a diamond pointed tip. She turns and opens her eyes, and they glow green. The sorceress looks around, then continues on. Melog envelopes the group in an invisibility fog and they enter the fortress.] 
Shadow Weaver: {gasps}  
[She extends her arm to stop the others as a figure appears at the end of a corridor. Glimmer startles.] 
{voices whispering indistinctly}  
Glimmer: {gasps}  
[Micah stands at the end of the hallway, his eyes glowing green and his face set in a frown. He narrows his eyes as he glares down the corridor, and tears well in Glimmer's eyes. Castaspella puts an arm around Glimmer's shoulders, tears running down her own cheeks. Micah glares, then strides off. Shadow Weaver waves them forward. They run down the hall and stand outside a round purple room with a raised platform in the middle. Catra peers inside.] 
Catra: No sorcerers here. Looks like we're-- 
Shadow Weaver: Keep your voice down. 
Catra: Don't touch me! {gasps} 
[A sorceror appears and casts a spell at the group. They hide and Adora runs forward.] 
Adora: For the Honor of Grayskull! {gasps, then yelps}  
[Adora raises her arm and nothing happens. The sorcerer blasts another spell and Adora cowers. Castaspella casts the sorcerer down.] 
Shadow Weaver: We have to hurry!  
[Shadow Weaver takes Castaspella's arm and they hurry on.]  
[At the shelter, Swift Wind stands at the entrance as Entrapta exits with a tracker pad.] 
Entrapta: Hmm.  
Swift Wind: Uh, hey there, where're you going?  
Entrapta: I'm so close to cracking Prime's signal pattern! But Spinnerella's chip's not enough. I need to find a place with a high concentration of clones so I can analyze their connection to the hivemind!  
Swift Wind: Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. You're just gonna walk into a place that's crawling with clones?  
Entrapta: Yep!  
Swift Wind: Ugh, there's no way I'm going to stop you from doing this, is there?  
Entrapta: Nope!  
Swift Wind: Oh, this is a terrible idea. Hop on. I can get you there faster, and get you out if there's trouble.  
Entrapta: Works for me! Thanks, Bird Horse!  
Swift Wind: For the last time, I'm not--Just get this over with.  
[She hops on Swift Wind's back and they fly off.]  
[Shadow Weaver leads the group as they run down the hall. Passing towering statues of sorcerers along the wall, Shadow Weaver stops.] 
Shadow Weaver: We're here. Follow my lead.  
Castaspella: Would a "please" kill you?  
[Shadow Weaver and Castaspella work together to cast a diamond shaped spell at a sorcerer on the wall. The spell glows over the image and the wall opens. They hurry inside, and the opening closes behind them. They are in a dark hallway and the walls are covered in symbols. Glimmer creates a ball of light in her hand and sends it into the air, illuminating the walkway. ] 
Glimmer: Whoa. 
[Catra crosses her arms.] 
Adora: Hey, are you--? 
Catra: I'm fine.  
Adora: Catra, it'll be okay. Trust me.  
[Catra looks at Adora.] 
Shadow Weaver: There's no time to waste. News of our presence will have reached the others by now after that...disturbance.  
[Catra scowls.] 
Adora: Come on. We have to keep moving.  
[Catra and Shadow Weaver glare, then they continue forward. Bow touches the wall.] 
Bow: What is all of this?  
Castaspella: We're on the right path. The Crystal of Arxia was rumored to be the key to reaching deep magic within Etheria. Many have tried, and failed, to find it. But those who hungered for more power have long sought other ways to obtain the deep magic...with disastrous results.  
Shadow Weaver: The Spell of Obtainment was a mistake, one for which I've paid the price. I don't see why you keep bringing it up.  
Castaspella: You roped my brother into your twisted dark magic when he was only a child. You could've killed him.  
Shadow Weaver: It would've worked had he not broken the connection. Micah was an exceptional sorcerer, even then. It's a shame it didn't run in the family.  
[Castaspella scowls at Shadow Weaver, then brushes past her. The others follow.]  
[Meanwhile, Swift Wind peers through bushes at a structure at a Horde Camp.] 
Swift Wind: What is going on over there?  
[He looks down at a diamond pattern on the ground and paws at it with his hoof.] 
Entrapta: The patern is incredibly complex. I need more connections.  
Swift Wind: No way! Whatever's going on here, it's not good. No tech is worth you getting captured by Prime!  
Entrapta: This isn't about tech. It's about our chipped friends. If I can get this to work, I can save them.  
Swift Wind: {groans} Oh, okay, but be quick. I'll cover you from behind. Please be careful.  
[Entrapta leaps in a tree, then bounds down close to the camp. She looks at a cluster of clones, then down on her tracker pad. Green lights glow.] 
Entrapta: Yes! I've got it!  
[A clone spots her.] 
Hordak: Ahh.  
Entrapta: Uh-oh.   
[Shadow Weaver leads the group to a room with a round purple emblem on the floor. Adora steps forward.] 
Shadow Weaver: Wait! 
Adora: {gasps} 
[Fire surrounds her.] 
Catra: Adora! 
[Catra leaps and pulls her out of the flames.] 
Adora: I'm okay. I'm okay.  
[They smile at each other.] 
Adora: Did you just jump into fire for me?  
Catra: What? No!  
Adora: {laughing} 
Catra: Shut up!  
Adora: You did.  
Glimmer: It's an illusion!  
Shadow Weaver: Some of the fire is illusory, and some is real. Everyone, be careful.  
[Shadow Weaver gestures, and Castaspella leads the way through the flames. The others follow, but Adora hangs back. She calms herself and enters the fiery path. Castaspella continues along the path, as flames lick up around her. Adora lags behind and looks at her hands. She clenches them into fists. Shadow Weaver walks beside her.] 
Shadow Weaver: I see you and Catra are close again.  
[Adora eyes her, looking angry.] 
Shadow Weaver: Do you really think that's wise?  
Adora: It's none of your business.  
Shadow Weaver: But it is. If your emotions are blocking you from becoming She-Ra, it's all of Etheria's business. How long has it been since you were able to transform?  
Adora: It's been happening ever since the Fright Zone. What if...? What if I'm losing her?  
Shadow Weaver: She-Ra is a being of pure magic. To unleash her full strength, you must be focused, clearheaded. But you are letting your emotions pull you in too many directions. Catra, she distracts you, confuses you. Haven't you hurt each other enough? If you care about her, focus on protecting her. The world needs you as She-Ra right now, not Adora. And if She-Ra can't stop Prime, then we are all doomed.  
Adora: I will stop Prime. No matter what.  
[Catra overhears.]  
Hordak: {growls} Who are you? What are you doing here?  
[Hordak pins Entrapta to a boulder and she looks up at him.]  
Hordak: Why do I know your face?  
Entrapta: Hordak?  
Hordak: No, do not say that name to me. I have no name.  
[He turns and opens his palm, feeling a purple diamond-shaped piece of tech.]  
Hordak: What have you done to me?  
Entrapta: You do remember me. I knew you would.  
Swift Wind: {neighs} Get away from her! Entrapta, let's go!  
[Swift Wind drags her away, and she meets Hordak's puzzled gaze.] 
Hordak: Go. Maybe then these memories, these imperfections, will leave me.  
Entrapta: Remember! Your imperfections are beautiful!  
[Hordak stares at Entrapta.]  
[Shadow Weaver leads the group through the flames and they reach a giant crystal structure.]  
Castaspella: {gasps} 
Bow: Whoa.  
Glimmer: That is the Failsafe?  
Bow: It's bigger than I thought it'd be. How are we gonna get that to the Heart?  
Shadow Weaver: The Failsafe is a code. It's stored inside of the Crystal.  
Adora: So, what do we--?  
Shadow Weaver: It needs a password.  
[She places Adora's hand on it.] 
Shadow Weaver: I think you already know what it is. 
Adora: We're friends of Mara.  
[A light radiates up the crystal and it cracks open. The crystal breaks into three sections and a triangular light connects them. The crystals are covered with symbols.] 
Glimmer: What does it say?  
Adora: "Someone needs to go inside and accept the Failsafe"? What does that mean?  
Shadow Weaver: It means the Failsafe must be bonded to a willing soul and carried to the Heart of Etheria in their body in order to be deployed.  
Bow: And we're sure that's safe?  
Shadow Weaver: We can't turn back now. The Failsafe is within our grasp.  
[Adora looks up, then strides forward as a light crackles over the crystals. Catra runs toward her.] 
Catra: Adora, don't go in there.  
Shadow Weaver: Catra, this is not the time. Someone must take the Failsafe.  
Catra: So, you do it, then. I've been watching you the whole way in. You've been in here before, haven't you? You could've taken the Failsafe yourself and gotten all the power you've ever wanted. But you didn't. Why?  
Shadow Weaver: You're being paranoid. This is the only way to stop Prime. Adora understands that well enough.  
Catra: Why does it have to be Adora? What is going to happen to her? What aren't you telling us?  
[Shadow Weaver narrows her eyes and takes a few steps backwards. The others stare at her.] 
Castaspella: Answer the question. 
Melog: {growling}  
Shadow Weaver: Whoever uses the Failsafe must absorb the full magic of the Heart when it is destroyed. That much raw magical power would burn any mere mortal apart. None of us are strong enough.  
Adora: But She-Ra is.  
Shadow Weaver: Only She-Ra can hope to survive the process. No one else can do it.  
[Adora turns to the crystal.] 
Adora: And if I don't survive it?  
Shadow Weaver: Then the magic will be restored to Etheria through your sacrifice. You will give us the power to bring us victory. Prime will be defeated. Your friends will be free.  
Castaspella: You were planning this all along!  
Catra: Why are you surprised by this?  
Glimmer: It's not going to work!  
Bow: There is no way we're risking Adora like that!  
{all shouting indistinctly}  
Adora: Stop it!  
[Adora turns to face the group.]  
Adora: I'll do it.  
Catra: No. What? What's wrong with you? Shadow Weaver is sacrificing you. Why can't you see that?  
Adora: Because even if she is, it's better than Prime getting the Heart and destroying the universe! We're out of options. This is the only way.  
[Castaspella whirls around.] 
{voices whispering indistinctly}  
Micah: Well, look who it is.  
[Micah appears with two sorcerers. He casts a spell and Adora shoves Catra aside.] 
Catra: Adora!  
[His spell binds Adora in black smoky ropes. Catra and Melog lunge and Micah, tumbling him. Bow fires arrows at a sorceress.] 
Bow: Whoa! 
[Shadow Weaver is hit.] 
Glimmer: Dad!  
Micah: Hello, daughter. I'm so pleased to see you.  
Glimmer: {gasps}  
Micah: And you, sister.  
[He looks at Castaspella, then Shadow Weaver.] 
Micah: Her, not so much.  
[Glimmer casts at Micah and he repels her spell with dark energy. He casts at her. She teleports as he blasts at her.] 
Adora: Glimmer!  
[Then she falls.] 
Adora: For the Honor of Grayskull! No. 
[A weak image of a sword flickers, then vanishes. Catra and Melog battle and sorceress, as Castaspella faces her brother. They cast spells at each other. Bow fires an arrow that turns into net. A sorceress breaks the net and blasts spikes at Bow.] 
Bow: We have to get out of here!  
Shadow Weaver: The Failsafe! We can't!  
[Adora gazes up at the crystal, then stands.] 
Catra: Adora, no! Please. It doesn't always have to be you!  
[Adora dashes inside.] 
Catra: Adora! {yells}  
[Adora steps on a circle symbol beneath the crystal and light beams down over her. Tendrils of glowing energy enter her body.] 
Adora: {yelling}  
[She's lifted off the ground. Micah fumes.] 
Micah: Ahh.  
[He casts a black spell that seeps over the floor trapping Catra, Shadow Weaver, and Glimmer.] 
Glimmer: What's happening?  
Micah: {laughs}  
Glimmer: Is that--?  
Micah: Dark magic. After all, I learned from the best.  
Castaspella: {gasps} Micah, no!  
[He binds Castaspella and lifts her into the air. The black shadow slithers over the crystals.] 
Adora: {yelling} {gasps}  
Castaspella: {groans}  
[Adora looks back as the others struggle in the dark energy. Adora grits her teeth and shuts her eyes closed.] 
Adora: For the Honor of Grayskull!  
[A white light fills the room and the dark energy is blasted away.] 
Micah: {yells}  
[She-Ra emerges from the light and swings the sword. She knocks down Micah and his sorceresses.] 
She-Ra: I've got it. I've got the Failsafe. Let's get out of here.  
[A symbol glows on She-Ra's chest and she extends her hand to Catra. Catra looks up, then runs away with Melog. Bow and Glimmer help Castaspella up.] 
Micah: {grunting}  
[Glimmer glances back, then leaves the room. As the door waves, She-Ra swings her sword and chunks of the walls and ceiling crumble, blocking off the chamber. She-Ra turns and runs after her friends.]  
[Entrapta works at her computer. An image of Hordak appears on-screen and she smiles. Bow and Glimmer sleep in side-by-side cots. He reaches out to touch her arm. Adora is asleep on a cot and Catra is perched on a wall watching her. The Failsafe symbol glows on Adora's chest and Catra frowns. Catra leaps down and Melog looks back.] 
Melog: {mewing}  
[Catra collects a backpack. She walks away, and Melog follows. Adora wakes and sits up in bed. She eyes Catra's empty bed.] 
Adora: Catra.  
[Catra and Melog walk away from the shelter.] 
Melog: {mewing}  
[Catra wears an angry expression on her face, as she strides forward, Melog at her side.] 
Adora: Catra?  
[Adora looks out of the shelter. Catra stops, then breaks into a run.] 
Adora: Catra, stop!  
[Adora races after her. Catra leaps in a tree and Adora pulls her down. She pulls away and Adora grabs her leg.] 
Adora: You were just gonna leave?  
Catra: I'm doing you a favor. I'm a distraction, right? Now you can go save the world without having to worry about me confusing you.  
Adora: No, that's not true. Don't listen to Shadow Weaver. This isn't about her.  
[Catra shoves Adora.] 
Catra: Why? Why are you like this? Why do you always have to sacrifice everything for everyone else? When do you get to choose?  
[Tears form in Catra's eyes.] 
Catra: What do you want, Adora?  
Adora: I...I have to do this, Catra. I'm the only one who can.  
Catra: Then do it. That's what you want. That's what you'll always choose. I don't have to stay and watch it happen.  
Adora: Catra, please, stay. I need you.  
Catra: No, you don't. You never have.  
[Melog turns them invisible and they disappear.] 
Adora: Catra!  
[After, Adora returns to the shelter, gripping Catra's backpack.] 
Shadow Weaver: Adora, you made the right choice. Don't let Catra convince you otherwise. She's never understood.  
Adora: Stop! I will never forgive you. You ruin people. You ruin any chance they could ever be happy. Haven't you done enough?  
Shadow Weaver: I did what I had to do.  
Adora: Keep telling yourself that. I'm going to take the Failsafe to the Heart, and I'm going to save Etheria. But I am not doing it for you. I'll do everything I can to make sure you never get your hands on the magic.  
[Adora storms off, leaving Shadow Weaver outside the shelter.]
