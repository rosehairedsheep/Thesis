Glimmer: This is awesome! I can't believe Mom agreed to let you stay in Bright Moon!
[Guards whispering] (I don't trust her...)
Adora: Yeah, awesome.
Glimmer: Okay. You've seen the dining hall, the throne room, the portrait hall. So, the last stop on our grand tour is... your new room! Ta-da!
{It has a cathedral ceiling and canopy bed.}
Adora: [Gasps]
Glimmer: It's pretty standard. You've got your vanity, the bathroom, crystals, bell pull, tea nook, more crystals, bed, desk, and of course, the waterfall.
Adora: Is the waterfall for showering?
Glimmer: Ha! Good one, Adora. "Waterfall for showering." [Laughs] I'm right down the hall if you need anything. Night.
Adora: Wait--
[Door closes]
{Glimmer leaves.}
Adora: Okay. This is different than the Fright Zone, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of this in no time.
{She sinks into the bed.}
Adora:  [Grunts] Help.

Theme plays
{Adora tries to climb out of the cushions in the circular canopy bed. She punches a pillow.}
Adora: [Grunting] Come on, get flatter!
{It rips.}
Adora: No! Go back in! Go back in! [Shouting]
{Feathers explode from the cushion and she exits the room.}
Adora: [Whispering] Glimmer? Glimmer? I think I killed the bed. [Shrieks] [Normal voice] Ma'am! I mean, Your Majesty. Sir! 
{Adora bows on one leg and salutes. She wipes feathers from her face.}
Adora:  [Coughs] So uh, what are you doing up?
Angella: When I feel the cares of the day weighing upon me, I come here.
Adora: Who is that?
Angella: King Micah. My husband. He built the Rebellion with me. And he was one of the first casualties of The Horde.
Adora: Sorry. I didn't know.
Angella: Adora. My daughter believes you can help us. Glimmer has vouched for you despite your background. And because I greatly love my daughter, I am willing to give you a chance. Do not disappoint her.
{The queen walks away.}

New scene
{The next morning, Glimmer wakes in her suspended bed.}
[Glimmer snoring]
[Yawning]
{Adora is asleep beside her.}
[Adora and Glimmer scream]
[Grunts]
{Glimmer startles and falls to the floor.}
Adora: [Gasps] Glimmer! Are you okay?
Glimmer: What are you doing in here?
Adora: I'm sorry! I couldn't sleep in my room. I've never slept without any other people around before. And then I ran into your mom, I think she doesn't like me.
Glimmer: What? My mom loves you.
Adora: Yeah, sure. She loves She-Ra.
Glimmer: Mom can be... a little intense, heh. But, our weekly meeting with the Rebellion Generals is today and you're invited. She wouldn't have invited you if she didn't like you.

New scene     
{Later, Adora, Glimmer, and Bow enter the meeting room. The walls are covered with paintings.}
Adora: Wow. Heh.
{Adora touches the drawing of a figure on the wall.}
Glimmer: Come on. Meeting's about to start.
Adora: Uh, the chairs are still empty.
Glimmer: Those are for the other Etherian Princesses, but... none of them have been active members since I was a kid. The Rebellion had a big defeat years ago, and most of the old Princesses gave up. Now all the kingdoms keep to themselves, and the new Princesses do the same.
Bow: Other than Spinnerella and Netossa. Hey, guys! [Whispers] We're not really sure what they do.
Adora: Ah.
{Adora sits, and the others gasp.}
[Gasping]
Adora: What? What? I don't understand.
Angella: This is not your chair.
Glimmer: Sorry! First day. Won't happen again!
Adora: [Whispers] What did I do?
Glimmer: [Whispers] You sat in my dad's chair.
Adora: [Whispers] Oh... Oh. I'm sorry.
{Queen Angella strokes the chair.}
Angella: I've asked you here because I've received a distress call from Princess Perfuma. The Horde is laying siege to her kingdom. She's asking Bright Moon for assistance. General?
Bright Moon General: Perfuma's kingdom, Plumeria, is located near the front lines. The Horde has set up camp in their territory, cutting off their main supply route
Angella: Bright Moon will provide food and humanitarian aid.
Glimmer: Ooh! I have a better idea. We can--
Angella: Fight the Horde? Glimmer, you propose this idea every meeting.
Glimmer: No! I was going to say, let's use aggressive fist-to-face sparkles.
Angella: I said, no, Glimmer. Now sit down!
[Glimmer huffs]
{She sits.}
Adora: You should send me, Glimmer, and Bow to lead the relief mission. You can send me as She-Ra. I'll make sure everyone gets there safely and protect Bow and Glimmer if the Horde attacks. I promise, I won't disappoint you.
Angella: [Sighs] Very well. You will deliver food and supplies to Plumeria, and under no circumstances will you engage the Horde. You leave at dawn.

New scene
{Cadets train in the Fright Zone.}
[Metal clanging, grunting]
Kyle: [Shouts] I give up! I give up!
Lonnie: [Grunts] Quit playing around, Kyle! Where's Catra? She's supposed to be here.
Catra: Not anymore, cadet Lonnie.
[Kyle shouting]
Lonnie: Why aren't you dressed?
Catra: Oh, Lonnie, Lonnie... sweet, dumb, Lonnie. [taps badge]
{Catra shows her badge.}
Lonnie: They made you Force Captain?
Kyle: Congrats, Catra! [shouting]
Catra: Hordak knows a good thing when he sees it. Now that I'm in charge, Shadow Weaver won't be the only one...Uh...
{Shadow Weaver appears behind Catra and she salutes. Shadow Weaver points and she and Catra meet in a locker room.}
[Kyle grunts]

New scene
Catra: What do ya need, Shadow Weaver? Ooh, are you giving me my first mission?
Shadow Weaver: You will explain how you lost Force Captain Adora.
Catra: [Groans] Ugh, I've told you everything I know about Adora! [slams locker]
Shadow Weaver: I know you're lying. You have to be lying. What happened to Adora? What did you do?
Catra: What did I do? She left us! She left me! You ever think Adora's not as loyal as you thought?
Shadow Weaver: I will learn the truth, Catra, even if I have to drag it from your--
{Shadow Weaver's headband glows red and she hunches over.}
[Shadow Weaver shouting]
[Catra grunts]
Shadow Weaver: Out of my way!
{She shoves Catra and hurries off.}

New Scene
{Meanwhile, Glimmer and Bow arrive in Plumeria. Trees are barren and withered.}
[Children laughing]
Glimmer: Wow. Mom didn't say anything about all the plants dying.
Bow: I don't think she knows. Wait, where's Adora?
{She-Ra hoists a wagon overhead.}
[She-Ra grunts]
Glimmer: Are you gonna be She-Ra the entire time we're here?
She-Ra: I told Queen Angella I would. Besides, people like me better as She-Ra. [Chuckles] Could Adora do this? [Grunts]
{She presses the cart.}
Glimmer: Hmm. Yep. Very useful to our mission.
Bow: Hey, guys. What is that?
{Smoke erupts.}
She-Ra: Must be coming from the Horde camp.
Perfuma: You're here!
Glimmer: Princess Perfuma. I'm Commander Glimmer of--
Bow: Ooh, I get a hat.
{Perfuma gifts Glimmer a bouquet of flowers and Bow a flower crown. She gazes at She-Ra. The warrior princess is covered in golden light.}
Perfuma: [Gasps] Oh, my. Everyone, come quick! It's, Oh, it's… It's… [Shouts] 
{They gather around She-Ra.}
Perfuma: Look! The universe has heard our pleas and sent the legendary She-Ra to help us save our home.
{Bow gives a thumbs up.}
She-Ra: [Sets down cart, Clears throat] We heard about the blockade and we've come to help.
{Perfuma beams.}
She-Ra: We brought food and supplies for you.
{Perfuma weeps.}
Perfuma: Welcome to Plumeria, She-Ra.
She-Ra: Um, Glimmer, what's happening?
Perfuma: Come with me, I'll show you around. You're gonna love it.
{She-Ra pries the clinging baby from her arm and follows Perfuma.}
[Baby cooing]

New Scene
Perfuma: Our people have lived here in tranquility for thousands of years. We're known for our beautiful flowers, our majestic trees. And this is the Heart-Blossom, the center of our kingdom, and the source of all my magical powers.
{She gestures to a towering tree with pink blossoms.}
Bow: At least this tree is fine. What happened to everything else?
Perfuma: We're going through a little rough patch, but I'm sure the universe will right itself soon.
Glimmer: Everything is dead or dying.
Perfuma: Look, the blight hit right after the Horde arrived. We don't know why, and nothing I do stops it. But we don't dwell on the negative. Look at the positive. The Heart-Blossom is still healthy, and the She-Ra is here, and the celebration's about to begin.
She-Ra: Celebration? [Grunts]
{Perfuma grabs She-Ra's arm.}

New scene
{Shadow Weaver enters a chamber and put her hands on a glowing red structure.}
[Door opens]
[Shadow Weaver groans, breathing heavily]
Shadow Weaver: You will not refuse me!
{A red symbol on her forehead glows.}
Hordak: Shadow Weaver.
Shadow Weaver: Lord Hordak!
Hordak: You have disobeyed my orders.
Shadow Weaver: I've done no such thing, Lord Hordak. My will is your will.
Hordak: Then explain to me why you've requisitioned more troops to look for one missing soldier. A soldier I ordered you to give up on.
Shadow Weaver: Finding Adora is crucial to the Horde's mission—
Hordak: [Slams armrest] Our mission is to kill the Whispering Woods so we can march on Bright Moon. Our mission is to destroy the princesses and their ridiculous rebellion. You are distracted, Shadow Weaver. Our ground troops demand your full attention. The siege on Plumeria has carried on for too long. You will give the order to increase power until victory is achieved. And never forget, I gave you your magical power and at my slightest whim, [whispers] I can take it away. [Normal voice] Understand?
Shadow Weaver: Of course, Lord Hordak.
[Shadow Weaver yells]

New scene
She-Ra: No, no, no, it's okay. You need this food more than we do.
Plumerian elder: Nonsense. It is our honor to serve the She-Ra.
{Adora takes a piece of fruit.}
[Food crunches]
Perfuma: We are so honored to have you.
Plumerian Citizen 1: Whoa. That's She-Ra.
Perfuma: Yes, I know. The She-Ra, right? I'm so happy that after all these centuries of being gone, you've finally returned. I said, break out party kale. And at our hour of greatest need, just like in the stories.
She-Ra: What stories?
Perfuma: The stories we've been telling for thousands of years. She-Ra, the warrior who tamed the beasts of Beast Island with a single word.
Bow: That's nothing. What about the time She-Ra defeated a squad of Horde soldiers on a flying horse? Or the time she saved Thaymor from a legion of Horde soldiers? Or the time she borrowed my toothbrush and used it to defeat an army of Horde soldiers.
She-Ra: Uh, Bow, that's not true.
Bow: You're right. It was two armies!
[all cheering]
{The villagers ply Adora with offerings.}
She-Ra: Uh...
[Baby coos]
Glimmer: Hey, calm down! Give her some space. One at a time. You first.
{A child offers a gift.}
She-Ra: Oh! Thank you for the…
Glimmer: [Whispers] Windchime.
She-Ra: Wind-chime.
{Smoke billows from a nearby field.}
[Explosion nearby]
Perfuma: We're so excited for you to heal our land and bring all the plants back to life. Will you be doing it before the drum circle or after?
She-Ra: You want me to--You want me to heal your land?
Perfuma: Yes! Like in the ancient story, "She-Ra Heals the Forest And Brings The Trees Back To Life."
Glimmer:  I've seen her do way weirder stuff. This'll be a snap.
She-Ra: Wait, it's not that simple. Plus, I don't like the look of that smoke. The Horde's up to something big. Maybe we should investigate.
Perfuma: We? This is my power. I grow plants.
{A flower wilts in Adora's hands.}
Perfuma: We're not strong enough to go up against the Horde. All we want is to live peacefully in our ancestral home.
Bow: And then She-Ra saved the day once again!
[Child laughs.]
Perfuma: We need you, She-Ra.
{The citizens gaze at her.}
[All chanting] She-Ra! She-Ra! She-Ra!
She-Ra: Yes, healing. That is a thing I know how to do. I just need to take Bow and Glimmer over to those trees for a moment. I know what I'm doing!

New scene
She-Ra: [Whispers] I don't know what I'm doing! I can't heal anything!
Bow: But, the stories say you have healing powers.
She-Ra: They also say I fought the Mantisaur. I don't even know what that is!
Glimmer: Why don't you just concentrate really hard? That seems to work whenever you need to transform.
She-Ra: [Deep breaths] Okay.
{She closes her eyes and grits her teeth. Rainbow beams of light radiate from her hand.}
[She-Ra grunting]
She-Ra: Did I do it?
Bow: No, you punched a tree. That's kinda the opposite of healing.
She-Ra: Let me try again. [chuckles]
{She-Ra lifts her hand and a beam of light shoots out.}
[She-Ra grunts]
[Glimmer shrieks]
Glimmer: Magic blast. Also not healing.
She-Ra: I'll get it this time.
{She tranforms a lizard into a winged unicorn lizard.}
[She-Ra grunts]
[Animal screeches.]
Glimmer: Magical transformation?
Bow: Wait, is that what happened to our horse?
[She-Ra grunts]
{She-Ra kicks her foot and a blast shoots out. Glimmer and Bow wince.}
[Thudding]
Bow: It's okay. You'll get it soon.
She-Ra: Soon isn't good enough! These people expect me to save their land. I thought I was better as She-Ra, but I'm useless no matter what form I take.
{Another explosion shakes the Earth. Bow's flower crown wilts and blows away.}
[Explosion nearby]
Bow: My hat!
Perfuma: She-Ra! Come quickly! Something absolutely terrible has happened!
{The Heart Blossom tree withers and pink leaves drift to the ground.}

New scene
Perfuma: The Heart-Blossom is dying. Please, She-Ra, heal our land.
{She-Ra steps forward. Bow gives a thumbs up and she puts her hand on the tree and closes her eyes. Golden light shines.}
She-Ra: Oh, come on, do something.
{Vines creep up the trunk and leaves fall.}
[She-Ra grunting]
She-Ra: No. [Sighs]
{She morphs back to Adora.}
[All gasping]
Adora: Sorry. I don't know how to heal.
Plumerian Citizen 2: Who are you? And where's She-Ra?
Adora: My name is Adora. I was chosen to carry the sword of She-Ra, but... I haven't been doing this for very long, and I don't know exactly how it works yet.
Plumerian elder: She's just a girl!
Adora: I never meant to deceive you. I am She-Ra, I'm just not the same She-Ra.
Perfuma: Then you can't save us?
{More smoke wafts into the sky and more vines cover the Heart Blossom. Villagers cling to each other and sob. Adora glances around.}
[explosion nearby]
[all gasping]
[all crying]
Adora: Wait! There might be another way. I know the Horde. I think they're using one of their machines to poison your land. If we wanna save your home, we have to stop them!
Plumerian Citizen 2: You're not She-Ra from the stories. You were supposed to save us.
Perfuma: It will be all right, I promise. We will rebuild. We have to believe that the universe will repay the Horde for their evil deeds eventually.
Glimmer: The universe won't protect you! You want She-Ra to fix everything, but won't even try to save yourselves? At least Adora's trying.
Perfuma: If She-Ra can't save us, no one can. Right now, we just need to make sure our people are safe. We leave today.
{Adora drops to her knees.}
Glimmer: Are you okay?
Adora: I just wanted to help. But all I've done is disappoint an entire kingdom. I'm sorry I let you guys down after you talked me up.
Bow: We just wanted everyone to see what an awesome person you are. I thought I was being supportive, but I was actually being terrible!
Glimmer: Adora, She-Ra's not the reason we like you. We like you because you're our friend.
{Smoke billows up and Adora stands.}
[Explosion nearby]
Glimmer: You have a plan, don't you?
Adora: Yeah. I think I do.

New scene
Adora: All clear.
{They sneak in the camp, wearing Horde uniforms.}
Adora: Okay, we need to find the machine. Every Horde camp is laid out the same. Guard duty's in half-hour shifts, so we walk in when the shift changes in three, two, one.
Horde soldier 1: Shift change!
Horde soldier 2: Finally! I swear, boring shifts go by slower.
{Adora enters the base. Tubes filled with green liquid bubble and smoke.}
[Adora gasps]
Glimmer: [gasps] You were right. The Horde is poisoning the land.
Horde soldier: Hey! What are you doing here?
Adora: [Scoffs] What are you doing here? We have security clearance, password 5-echo-niner. Now be on your way.
Horde solider: We haven't used that password in months. Hands up!
[alarm wailing]
Bow: Adora? What do we do?
Adora: Run!

New scene
Plumerian Citizen 2: Hey, the Bright Moon guys left.
Perfuma: "We've gone to the Horde camp to find the weapon killing your trees. If we don't make it, I wanted to say I'm sorry. I couldn't be the hero you wanted. -Adora." 
{Perfuma eyes the smoke.}
Perfuma: She's still trying, even though we were so negative. Glimmer was right. This is our home, we can't let her do this alone! Everyone, She-Ra and our friends from Bright Moon are risking their lives to protect us from the Horde. We need to help them! Get the warchimes, we march!
[all cheering]

New scene
{Adora, Glimmer, and Bow run as Horde soldiers shoot at them.}
[all shouting, blasting, crashing, grunting]
{They hide behind barrels. Adora peaks out, then hurls a brick. She knocks a soldier, and they flee. The three friends leap off the side of a building.}
Adora: How many soldiers can you take?
Bow: Between one and... zero. [panting] Whoo.
Glimmer: [panting] I'll take them all, if you give me a minute.
[soldiers shouting]
{More soldiers surround them wielding laser guns.}
[horn wailing]
{Perfuma rides in on a bed of vines.}
Perfuma: I've always said the universe will repay the Horde one day. Well, I guess that day is today!
Plumerian Child: For the She-Ra!
[all shouting]
{Perfuma knocks a soldier with her vines and another villager whacks a soldier with a flowerpot. Glimmer appears in front of a soldier.}
Glimmer: Hey.
{She vanishes, then reappears.}
Glimmer: Ooh. [chuckles, grunts]
Perfuma: I've never been so alive!
{Adora shoves one soldier, then kicks another. She glances around as the villagers battle the Horde, then runs behind a building and pulls out her sword. }
Adora: [grunting and shouting] For the honor of Grayskull!
{Adora raises the sword in one hand. Purple surrounds her and her body glows bright yellow. She waves the sword around her body and a ring of golden fire at her feet transforms into a white and gold uniform. Her blonde hair billows out and a golden crown rings her head. She tosses the sword in the air and punches her open palm, then grabs the sword and holds it aloft. She throws the sword and it gets lodged in the wall of the base between two boulders. She shoves them aside then blasts it away. She jumps on a tank and stabs it.}
[She-Ra transformation theme]
[She-Ra grunting and shouting]
She-Ra: For Etheria! [shouts]
{She zaps the tank and green light floods the base and seeps into the earth outside the camp. It runs up the Heart Blossom tree and into Perfuma's body. A flower blooms in Perfuma's hand and she twirls around. The Heart Blossom tree erupts with pink blossoms.} 
[Perfuma gasps, then laughs]
Horde Soldier: Ew! Yuck!
{Plants and flowers grow around the camp and the Horde soldiers. They run off and Perfuma hugs She-Ra.}
Horde Soldier: [yelling] Retreat! Retreat!
Perfuma: Thank you so much! You inspired us to save ourselves. How can we ever repay you?
Glimmer: Join the Rebellion, and help me reform the Princess Alliance.
Perfuma: Um, are you sure? Didn't that go horribly the first time?
Glimmer: It went horribly for our parents. But we have a chance to do it right. We're clearly stronger together. Think what all the Princesses united could do.
Perfuma: Would I get to hit more people with flowers?
Glimmer: Absolutely.
Perfuma: You have a deal. Hey, everyone! Look at us. We're mighty rebels now.
[All cheering]

New scene
[Door closes]
{Catra visits Shadow Weaver.}
Catra: Force Captain Catra reporting for--
Shadow Weaver: This was brought to me by retreating soldiers, retreating because their camp was attacked by Adora and She-Ra. Pathetic, you're still trying to protect her. Did you think you could keep the truth from me?
Catra: It's just a phase, she's confused. I'll bring her back in, I swear.
Shadow Weaver: Oh, yes, you will. Because until I tell you otherwise, that is your mission. And to ensure success, no matter where Adora goes, no matter how long it takes, my shadow spies will find her.
[Catra gasps]
Shadow Weaver: Find her and bring her home.

New scene
[Door opens]
{Adora enters a room to find Glimmer and Bow.}
Adora: What is this? [Chuckles]
Glimmer: Since you've never slept in a room by yourself before, Bow and I thought we'd throw you a sleepover, then you won't feel so alone.
Bow: We even got you a new bed.
{She eyes a single cot.}
Adora: [gasps, whispers] It's wonderful.
Bow: We can do this tomorrow too, since Glimmer's grounded for ignoring orders.
Glimmer: For one week. That's three weeks less than normal. And Mom said she'd consider my plan to recruit new Princesses into the rebellion!
Adora: Thanks, guys. I might not ever be the perfect hero everybody wants me to be, but that's okay.
[Adora grunts]
Glimmer: Of course it's okay. Do you have any idea how annoying you'd be if you were perfect?
[Glimmer and Adora laughing]
Bow: Aw! Best Friend Squad is having a pillow fight!
Adora: Yeah, we're not calling ourselves that.
Glimmer: I prefer "The Glimmer Group.”
Bow: Nah. We're the Best Friend Squad.
