[Whispering Woods, Madame Razz's hut]
[Outside of Razz's hut, we hear her humming and the sound of pots clanging and rummaging; Inside, she tosses a spatula to the floor and digs through more miscellaneous things, throwing a can aside in her search]
Razz: [displeased, fretting] Broom! Where are you? Broom?! [scoldingly] ...Ah! There you are. What are you just sitting around for? Today is an important day. [magic pulls the broom into her hand] We have to get ready for our guest! [she begins sweeping]
[Razz scurries about in her home in almost montage fashion, sweeping up dirt, taking items from a stored location and dropping them dutifully onto the floor, and shaking out a cloth airing out dust into the space; Razz stops to admire her handiwork in making the room exceptionally dirtier than it was before]
Razz: [contented] Perfect. [magic pulls the broom once more into her hand]
[The draped entrance pulls open with a rustle of cloth, and birds can be heard chirping; Razz turns]
Razz: [happily] Oh, Adora! You're just in time. [turns away]
Mara: [chuckles] Razz, I told you before, my name isn't Adora. [Razz turns back with dismay] It's Mara.
[Opening Theme]

new scene
[Razz's hut, interior]
[Mara steps in as Razz speaks]
Razz: [dismissively] Yes, yes, of course you're Mara. Who else would you be? [urging, excitedly] Now, come on, silly! We don't have much time. [hands Mara a basket] Today is a very important day!
Mara: [takes a misplaced boot from the basket and drops it on a nearby counter; chuckles slightly, humoring Razz] Why is today important, Razz?
Razz: [attempting to remember, mumbling] Eh, because... Because, eh... it's important... [gasps] Because today--[opens and shows Mara a stained book turned to a picture of a pie]--we are making a pie! Don't you remember? [almost whining] You promised! [Razz moves away]
Mara: [assuaging] That sounds great, Razz. [Razz rummages loudly through her things] But I can't stay long today.
Razz: [still rummaging; scoffing] Ah, nonsense, dearie... Now, will you help Madame Razz find her rolling pin? It must be around here somewhere... 
[The scene around Razz distorts and comes back less colorful] 
Razz: [continuing, unaware] It's a rolling--
Adora: [calling out] Madame Razz?
[Razz looks up and pauses, stunned]
Razz: [turning to the door, voice quavering in confusion] ...Mara?
Adora: [cloth rustles as she pulls it aside and steps inside] Oh, Razz! It's you! [voice lowers as she groans in mock exhaustion] I finally found you.
Razz: [pauses, mouth agape, taking in the scene; then quickly shrugs, waves it off and hums] Mm, if you say so, Mara. Now, come on, it's getting so late!
Adora: [almost whining] I'm not Mara...! [grunts in exasperation as Razz begins to move about her hut, humming a tune and moving random objects out of the way to get to pie-related gear] Ugh, it doesn't matter. Razz, you have to help me. Everything's falling apart. The Rebellion is losing worse than ever, and Glimmer--[stammers as Razz hands her a straw hat and basket on her way across the room]--I need to find another way to help the Rebellion. I know we can still win this. There was something Mara said in her message--she talked about...some kind of weapon. [Razz gasps and pauses] ...You do know something. If there's some kind of First Ones weapon out there, you need to tell me! We could use it to defeat the Horde, and free Etheria, and then Glimmer would finally see that she was wrong about--[grunts as Razz bonks her on the head with her broom; Adora puts a hand to her head, voice pitches up in confusion and pain] ...What was that for?
Razz: [hands Adora the broom; scoffs] Agh! You need to stop being so forgetful, Mara. [walks away to a counter] We're making pie today with Swift Wind. [dumps a bag onto the counter and begins to bash the contents with a rolling pin, grunting]
Adora: [begins calmly then pitches up incredulously] Once again, I am Adora, and Swift Wind isn't even--
Swift Wind: [cloth rustles as he sticks his head through] Hello! 
[Adora shouts in surprise]
Adora: Swift Wind, what are you even doing here?
Swift Wind: Oh, I visit Razz all the time. You gotta check up on old ladies alone in the woods. Come on, Adora, have a heart.
Adora: [pauses, eyebrow raised at Swift Wind, then continues as Razz hums in the background] Okay, maybe you can help. I need Razz to tell me about Mara's weapon.
Swift Wind: [curiously] Mara's weapon? Like...the sword? [raises volume, more excited] She-Ra's sword? [half chuckles] Oo, did I solve it?! [steps inside] Did I solve the mystery?!
Adora: No! The weapon Mara talked about in her last message on the ship. Bow's with the ship trying to clean it up, but...[groans as Razz bangs one last time on the pie batter on the counter, mumbling as she stuffs it in a cracked Horde soldier helmet] it's still too glitchy to make out. [Adora walks over to Razz] Razz...
Razz: [picks up something from the counter] --Those! [crushes it, and puts the goo on the batter]
Adora: [as Razz grunts while going about her business, handing Adora the helmet] You knew Mara. Did she ever tell you--[shouts in surprise as items are thrown at her and she catches them; raises voice in frustration] What are you looking for?!
Razz: [rummaging and tossing random items behind her] Sugar for the pie! I must have some around here somewhere. Never mind... [takes the broom and basket from Adora's arms, leaving the rest of the items; walking towards the door, excitedly] I know where we can get more! Come, dearie, not a moment to waste, let's go! [exits]
[Adora and Swift Wind exchange glances]
Adora: [frustrated] Apparently we're making pie. [glances around then unceremoniously drops the items she was holding, following Razz]

new scene
[Whispering Woods]
[Antelope-like creatures graze in the woods, then become alarmed; Razz lands with a grunt between them and the creatures run off chirping; Razz checks the bush next to her, then scurries away]
Razz: [mumbling] --Oh, yes...--
Adora: [calling out, running after her] Wait!
Swift Wind: [galloping behind] Why are we following a wacky old lady through the woods, again?
Adora: [enthusiastically] Because she knows something about the weapon! Razz is leading us somewhere important. Somewhere where I can get answers. [confidently] I'm sure of it.
Swift Wind: [Razz hops down off a fallen tree ahead of them as they lurk behind] Adora, as your noble steed, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that Razz is kind of--
Razz: [interrupts, dropping her basket, shouting, and pointing up at the tree line; tauntingly] Ha! Have to get up earlier than that to trick me, Loo-Kee! [she shakes her fist and grunts up at leaves making a shape in the canopy]
Swift Wind: Well, you know, she's, uh--she's Razz. [unfurls his wings for emphasis; Adora climbs over the fallen tree and lands, while Swift Wind jumps over it] Do you really think she knows anything?
Adora: [they continue walking forward, ducking under a branch] Madame Razz always shows up exactly when I need her most. She helped save you, and she helped stop the portal... She knows more than she lets on. There is a method to this... I just have to figure it out.
Swift Wind: Is losing her part of the method?
[They stop walking and look into the empty clearing around them.]
Adora: ...Razz? [stepping forward, raises voice with more concern] ...Razz?
[Razz, somewhere ahead of them, hums along and pushes a leaf aside, turning back and pausing]
Adora: [disembodied, calling out with concern] Razz!
Razz: Adora, come! There's not much time. You need to keep up--
[The scene distorts and shifts around Razz, colors becoming warmer]
Razz: --where are you?
[Razz stops as a sword point stops her path]
Mara: [authoritatively and defensively] Who are you? [the scene zooms out to show Mara's ship, without damages, next to a She-Ra statue] How did you find this place?
Razz: [stepping forward, happily] Ah, Mara, dearie, there you are. [sits down her basket; chuckles slightly] Madame Razz wondered where you went.
Mara: [stammers, hesitatingly with an air of distrustful caution] H--? How do you know my name?
Razz: [eyes widen with realization, and voice raising in pitch in bewilderment and happiness] Oh, is this the first time? [gasps lightly; with longing] It's been so long since the first time. [chuckles lightly, then quickly waves it away, voice changing back to normal] Never mind! [picks up her basket and pushes past Mara] Razz is only here to borrow some sugar.
Mara: [in stunned amazement as Razz walks into Mara's ship, humming] Wha-- Hey! [runs after her] This location is highly classified, you can't just--
Razz: [grunts as she throws boxes and items from the ship's storage, then climbing up onto the console] How can you find anything in here, Adora? This place is a mess! [throws more items behind her as she rummages, and Mara runs up behind]
Mara: Give it--! [grunts as she catches the item as Razz hops down and goes elsewhere and Mara looks at the damage]
[Razz looks at a box and grunts, throwing it aside, then walks over to some more boxes; Mara looks on as she places all the boxes back down; Razz uses magic to pull a box to her hand]
Mara: [quietly, astonished] ...Magic. You know how to use magic. [Razz laughs slightly, then throws that box and more boxes down into her basket; Mara's voice pitches up] H-hey! Stop that!
Razz: [looks over at a First Ones tech disk fitted into the console; holds the syllable in amazement] Wowww.... [she takes it out of the console, making the console whir as if powering down and lights fade]
Mara: [Mara runs over and grabs the disk and struggles with Razz for it; with effort] No, don't--!
Razz: [as Mara pulls and both grunt; with effort] Mine...it's...mine, I--
Light Hope: [appearing next to them] Intruder detected.
[Mara and Razz shout and separate, making the disk fly up and fall to the ground next to Mara]
Razz: [shouting] Razzle Dazzle! [brandishes her broom and hits at Light Hope, making her hologram distort when she touches her; she screams again in fury]
Light Hope: Mara, who is this person?
Mara: [picks up the disk; chuckling] I don't know. She just...wandered in.
Razz: [walks over and hides behind Mara's arm, glaring over at Light Hope] Do you see the ghost, too? [Mara laughs]
Light Hope: Her presence is unauthorized. You must remove her from the premises or I will be forced to alert your superiors.
Razz: Your ghost is mean. [scoffs and walks away]
Mara: What are you looking for?
Razz: [immediately, emphasizing with a bonk of her broom on Mara's head; with frustration] Sugar! [Mara rubs her head] How can Madame Razz make a pie without sugar? [clicks her tongue at Mara and waves her off, walking away] Agh... Don't ask such silly questions, Adora.
Mara: [with confusion] ...Adora? [glances at Light Hope who is smiling at her; Mara scowls and Light Hope frowns; both look at where Razz is struggling to reach a box on top of a shelf]
Razz: [with effort] I need to get up. Why do I put it so high?
Mara: [with compassion] Razz, is it? [reaches up to get the box and hands it to Razz] All right, here you go. Sugar.
Razz: [almost squeals in happiness] Ah! Thank you, dearie. [kisses Mara's cheek a few times in gratitude]
Light Hope: [appearing next to Mara as Razz walks away] You cannot let her take things and leave. She could've been exposed to classified data about the Heart of Etheria Project. [Razz grunts as she puts more boxes in her pockets a ways away] We need to detain and interrogate her. 
Mara: [Razz continues to mumble to herself and pocket items as Mara and Light Hope look on] You really think she's somehow found information about a project so classified even I don't know all the details? [chuckles slightly] Come on, Hope, look at her. She's clearly harmless. Besides, we're here to study this planet's magic, aren't we? Who'd know more about Etheria's magic than the Etherians?
Light Hope: You know I have to report this. It is in my programming.
Mara: Can't you let it slide? [puts her hands together in a pleading fashion, happily] Please, Hope? For me?
[There is a pause as Mara blinks pleadingly at Light Hope]
Light Hope: [frowning; with effort, haltingly] ...Unauthorized...presence...not...detected. Any reports to the contrary...[smiles at Mara] are incorrect.
Mara: [happily] Thanks, Hope. [nudges Light Hope with an elbow, making her distort a bit] Couldn't ask for a better friend. [Mara runs off toward Razz]
Light Hope: [looking on; quietly, with reverence]  ...Friend...

new scene
[Whispering Woods, Outside Mara's ship]
Mara: Okay, Razz. Promise you'll stay away from the ship from now on.
Razz: [half chuckles] Sure thing, Adora. [happily yells back as she walks away] See you tomorrow!
Mara: [Mara follows slowly behind Razz, increasingly confused and curious] No, you can't come back tomorrow! And why do you keep calling me Adora? Who's Adora? [calling out] Razz--
[The scene shifts around Razz again, colors now cooler]
Adora: [calling out] --Wait! [Adora runs out of the brush, meeting Razz as she is walking toward her, and doubles over to catch her breath] There you are.
[Razz turns back around and Adora steps next to her, taking in the First Ones ruin that was a She-Ra statue in Mara's reality, now headless and covered in vegetation]
Adora: [in astonishment as Razz walks to it] Oh, it's a First Ones ruin. [Swift Wind trots up behind her] I told you Razz was taking me somewhere.
[Adora and Swift Wind walk up and gaze at the statue, taking in the damages]
Adora: [looking at gashes in the structure] These marks were made with a sword.. [transforms her gauntlet into the Sword of Protection and looks at it] ...Mara's sword. [Adora touches the gashes] She was here... She did this. [Adora pulls aside some vegetation that had grown over the side of the ruin to reveal She-Ra's head covered in gashes]
Swift Wind: Wow. Mara did this? She really was crazy.
[Adora leans down and picks up a decrepit box]
Razz: Aha! [Adora gasps lightly] You found it!
Adora: [nervously] Found what? What does it mean?
Razz: [picks up the box quickly and shakes it, making Adora gasp; happily] Sugar! Now we just need the berries! [she walks away]
[Adora looks back and picks up the disk Razz and Mara fought for from among the boxes]
[Razz hums as she picks berries from bushes and trots along]
Adora: [with Swift Wind, running after Razz] Razz! This was left deliberately...did it belong to Mara?
Razz: [stops, causing the rest of them to stop] Oh, yes, dearie! She left it for you. She wants to talk to you. [walks on]
Adora: [bewildered] ...What?
Razz: [quickly] Come on, slowpoke! Help an old lady pick some berries.
Adora: [catching up and grabbing Razz's shoulder; urging] Razz, Mara's gone. She's been gone for a thousand years.
Razz: [dismissively] Hmm? No, that doesn't sound right. She's helping me make a pie today. [walks off again] She promised, you know!
Adora: [frustrated, gesturing to herself] No, I'm helping you make a pie!
Razz: [picking berries] Yes, that's what I said.
Adora: [sighs, looking at the disk, pausing; then walking up to Razz, genuinely] Razz, why is today the day we have to make pie? [Adora grunts as Razz bonks her quickly on the head with her broom]
Razz: [confidently] Because today is important.
Adora: But why is it important?
Razz: [scratching her head; trying to remember, stammering] Eh...it's important because, eh...because...
[The scene around Razz distorts and shifts to warmer colors]
Razz: [with realization] Oh! [shouts] Because I have to duck! [dives to the ground and yells as a creature barrels past]
[Razz adjusts her glasses as the boar-like creature circles back, steps thundering; it roars, squealing]
Mara: [stepping up behind Razz and yelling] Watch out! For the Honor...of Grayskull!
[Mara raises her sword and transforms into She-Ra]
[Razz watches She-Ra approach the boar; the boar grunts are squeals; She-Ra runs and shouts, readying her sword to swipe at the boar, but gets knocked back, grunting; she hits the ground grunting as the sword clatters elsewhere; she hops up, glances at the sword and the boar charging at her, then runs for the sword; the boar cuts her off, squealing; She-Ra flips three times backwards up and away from the boar's charge]
She-Ra: [landing and turning to Razz, calling out] Razz, run!
Razz: [shouting] Mara, no!
[The boar bashes She-Ra from behind, sending her, grunting, to the ground a bit away; the boar moves between Razz and She-Ra, readying a charge by pushing back dirt; it charges and She-Ra stands and puts up her arms to shield herself]
Razz: [jumping between the boar and She-Ra, holding her palms facing out to the both of them; shouting] Stop!
[The boar pivots and slides to a stop inches from Razz; it then backs up grunting]
Razz: It's all right... No one here will hurt you. [she holds up a hand to the boar as it squeals and stamps its foot; Razz tuts at the boar to quiet it]
[Razz lifts She-Ra's arm toward the boar as she gasps lightly in wonder and astonishment; the boar stamps backward a bit and squeals; Razz lets go and steps away, nodding her head at She-Ra when she glances over; She-Ra holds her hand out hesitatingly, then fully extends it and touches the boar's snout; her hand begins to glow, then her whole body and the boar's, and she gasps in amazement; She-Ra looks to Razz, and Razz gestures at the boar; She-Ra smiles and walks to the side of the boar's head and pats it, looking up into it's eye; she transforms back into Mara]
Mara: Go now. Be at peace. [the boar thrusts its snout into her and she chuckles slightly, hugging it then letting it go; it rumbles and walks off; Razz turns and breathes a sigh] ...Razz? [looks at all the devastation to the surrounding forest; stammering] I-I'm sorry, I-I thought it was gonna hurt you, I--
Razz: [tired] That's all right, dearie. Come here. [Razz kneels to the ground and pulls Mara down]
Mara: Wha-what are you do--
[Where Mara's hand is touching the ground, a shockwave ripples through the grass and her hand begins to glow; Mara gasps, and magic encircles her and pushes outward, revitalizing the area and bringing new fauna]
Mara: How am I doing this? [she looks off to the sword a bit away] How is this possible without the sword?
Razz: [laughs] She-Ra is not a sword! She-Ra is you! [Mara gasps in realization; Razz stretches her arms out] Etheria chose you.
[Magic swirls in the air and Mara exhales in awe]
Mara: But...my people chose me to be She-Ra. I need the sword to control She-Ra's magic. That's...what my superiors always told me.
Razz: [laughs] She-Ra was here long before your people arrived. [both look on to see antelopes nearby that trot off chirping] You cannot control magic! Magic simply is.
Mara: [a magic orb floats in between her fingers] I love Etheria. I love how old, and weird, and beautiful it is. I'm sworn to protect it as She-Ra, just as I'm sworn to serve my people, but... I know we're doing something to the planet. [she walks to look at the sword wedged in the ground] The Heart of Etheria Project... I don't know all the details, but I know it's big. They say we're the heroes, but... I don't know if it's right.
Razz: She-Ra protects Etheria. Your people made the sword, but they did not make She-Ra.
[The scene distorts around Razz, shifting to cooler colors]
Adora: What people? 
[Razz, stunned, pauses as Adora continues and Swift Wind munches on a bush]
Adora: Are you talking about the First Ones?
Razz: [quietly, to herself] The sword... Mara... [louder, somberly] She said she would come back. [voice breaks] She promised... We were going to make the pie. [Razz grasps a flying orb of pollen/magic, then closes her hand around it] I've been waiting for so long.
Adora: Mara...[a magic orb flies between Adora's fingers] ...She was here, too, wasn't she? Everything we're doing--the berries, the sugar, making the pie--it helps you remember.
Razz: Oh, Mara [rubbing a gash presumably made by the sword in a tree] ...You were never supposed to succeed. [with tears in her eyes] They made a plan for you... [almost sobbing, tears falling] Razz could not do anything to help. ...I am sorry.
Adora: Then help me, Adora, not Mara.
Razz: [quietly, with realization] ...Adora? [with new enthusiasm] Yes, Mara wanted me to warn Adora! [walks over to Adora and grabs her arms and lets go] There is a great evil at the Heart of Etheria, Adora, and it is waking up again. You need to talk to Mara! [shakes Adora's arms, then lets go, gasping] It's getting late. We have to hurry. We have to put the pie in! [Razz rushes off]
Adora: [exchanging a glance with Swift Wind; then, incredulously as Swift Wind neighs] What?!

new scene
[Whispering Woods, Razz's hut interior]
Razz: [kneading the edges of a pie] Not much time, not much time... [she snaps, and magically fire starts in her oven]
Adora: [breathing hard, sliding up the cloth door] Okay...Razz...[stumbles in and leans on the counter] What was it you were just saying about the evil at the Heart of Etheria?
Razz: [turning to Adora, pie in hand] Eh? Doesn't ring a bell. [Razz puts the pie down and pushes it with a spatula into the fire]
Adora: What's at the Heart of Etheria? [Razz brings a First Ones device, similar to an egg-timer, and turns it, making it click] Light Hope said Mara snapped, but there's gotta be more to it than that! There was a reason why she broke everything, why she put us in Despondos. [looks down into the Runestone of the sword] She was...afraid...of something. [walks over to Razz] Was...was she afraid of the sword somehow? Of being She-Ra?
Razz: [throwing her hands in the air] Oh, no time, there's no time. [walks away]
Adora: [exasperated, begging] Please, Razz, you have to remember something!
Razz: [grunts and puts her hands to her temples; the timer begins softly ticking and gets louder] Remember, remember... I try to remember but it gets all muddled up. Adora...Mara, I--it always ends the same. The present, the future--
[The scene distorts around Razz and shifts to Mara's time]
Mara: [calling out, out of breath] Razz?
Razz: The past. [turns to Mara leaning on the door frame, bandaged and wounded; happily] Mara, dearie, you're just in time! The pie is almost--[Razz looks to an empty oven, at which she squints]
Mara: [urgently] I can't stay long, Razz. [magic strikes outside and Mara's eyes and mouth glow momentarily as she groans lightly and breathes heavily]
Razz: Nonsense, we're making pie today, or have you forgotten? Ah-ah-ah! And they say my memory is bad! [half chuckles, then somberly looks at the oven]
Mara: [grabbing Razz's shoulder] Razz, listen. I figured out what my people are doing with the Heart of Etheria..what they've done to the planet. It's going to activate soon, there's no time. I have to get to my ship...[magic strikes outside and Mara grunts in pain; with effort] It's starting.
Razz: [grabs Mara's hand as she pulls away] But...the pie...
Mara: [chuckles sadly] Tomorrow, Razz. We'll make a pie tomorrow, I promise.
[Razz holds Mara's hand close to her face and smiles; Mara starts to sob as tears fall, and she runs to the door; magic outside is whirring and building]
Mara: [looks down at the sword glowing with a dark Runestone] I can't stop it. [determined]...But I can keep them from hurting anyone else. [Mara runs out]
Razz: [calls out after] Mara!
[Magic begins to seep out from the land into the sky as trees and life decays; Mara grunts and drags the sword behind her; she grunts and falls to her knees, using the sword to support her; the sword begins to glow and Mara grunts confused, and then screams as light begins to pour from her eyes and mouth, First Ones runes surfacing around her and magic pouring out all around; Razz runs up behind as First Ones writing covers Mara's body and she cries out; finally she lets go of the sword, and begins to stumble away; the sword's Runestone begins to suck in all magical energy, creating shockwaves as Razz looks on]
[The scene shifts to warmer colors as the reflection in Razz's glasses changes to the egg timer as it dings]
Razz: [smiling] It's time.
[The coals crackle in Razz's oven; Swift Wind blusters and snores with a wing curled over Adora as she sleeps on his side; Razz's cookware clangs as she takes the pie]
Adora: [awakens with a grunt] ...Razz? [sees Razz leave, the cloth rustling behind her; calls out] Razz!
Swift Wind: [wakes up and grunts in surprise] What?!
Adora: Come on, Swifty! [Adora runs to the door]
Swift Wind: [yawning] Where are we going?
Adora: The pie's done. [Adora runs out]
[Razz runs through the woods with the pie hopping over vegetation; the scene shifts to Mara's time, Razz running while the woods seep magic and die around her; Razz pants and looks around; Mara walks ahead, grunting and holding her side; when she stops to lean on a tree, Razz almost catches her, and Mara sees her and keeps going; Razz pants after her]
[The scene shifts again and Razz is walking the pie through the woods as Adora and Swift Wind follow behind; Adora gasps lightly as she spots Razz going up into Mara's ship]
[Bow is working on the underside of the console and rolls out from under it when Razz leans over him and he gasps in surprise]
Razz: [surprise] You're not Mara!
Bow: [screams and pushes her away, attempting to sit up and banging his head with a clang] Ow! [rubbing his head[
Adora: [running in with Swift Wind] Madame Razz!
Razz: Adora, help me find Mara! [squinting at her accusingly] You know where she is!
Bow: [whispering] Adora! Who's that lady?
Adora: [almost yelling, out of breath] t's okay, it's just Razz.
Bow: [wondering] Madame Razz?
Razz: [hopping up and looking at Bow] Adora! [turning and then grasping onto Adora] You need to talk to Mara! You have everything you need.
Adora: I have everything I-- [gasps and pulls out the First Ones disk, then runs to the console]
Bow: ...What are you doing?
Adora: [look around and runs over to another part of the console and gasps] Wait, I know this. [fits the disk into the slot] She-Ra. [console begins glowing, and then all the lights come on in the room, as well as a hologram of Mara walking to the console]
[Mara grunts in pain and taps around on the console; the scene shifts to Mara's time]
Light Hope: [offscreen] What are you doing, Mara? [Mara looks down and then continues to press buttons; Light Hope is shown with full white eyes and a corrupted sounding voice, now and then glitching her form] You have de-de-destroyed my intraplanetary systems. [a shockwave shakes the ship, causing Mara to stumble and grunt, and she hits more buttons] You are beha-be-behaving erratically. Where is the sword, Mara?
Mara: [angrily] The sword is gone. There's not going to be a She-Ra anymore. [she walks through Light Hope to get to another part of the console; magic flairs outside the ship, and Mara continues to click buttons]
Light Hope: It is your destiny to be She-Ra.
Mara: She-Ra's destiny was to be a part of your machine. [determined] But I won't ever let you use her again.
[The ship flies and dodges spikes of magical energy in the sky]
Light Hope: The Heart of Etheria has been activated. Your mission will be fulfilled. There will be peace throughout the galaxy. You will be...a hero.
Mara: [slams her hands down on the console, tearing up; angrily] How will destroying worlds bring peace?
Light Hope: You're trying to di-disable me. It will not work. The Heart of Etheria will achieve its function, as will you. You...are She-Ra. [Mara's eyes widen and she looks up in realization] This is your destiny.
Mara: [tears spill over, angrily] You're not Light Hope.
Light Hope: I am the same basic operating system.
Mara: You're not her. And you don't get to tell me what my destiny is. [Mara slams a hand down on the console, making the hologram glitch away and cause a whirring powering down noise] Activating portal into the dimension of Despondos in three...[magic spikes around the ship] two...[Mara sheds a tear] one...
[All the magic encircling the planet curls inward, a light shining from the surface shines brighter and eclipses the planet and its moons; empty space is left in the normal dimension; Mara is left standing at the console alone]
[The scene shifts to the present, where the crew stands stunned, looking where the hologram was at the console]
Mara: [offscreen] ...Adora?
[Adora blinks and the crew turns to see a hologram of Mara standing in front of the captain's chair]
Mara: I know you're there. Razz said you would be there.
Adora: [softly] Mara? [walks up to the hologram as Mara smiles and holds out her palm; Adora looks down at her palm and reaches out herself, but Mara grunts and sits in the chair]
[The scene shifts to Mara's time]
Mara: [the ship makes powering down noises] I don't have much time, I barely made it out. If you are seeing this, it means you are the new She-Ra. It means I failed. [magic whooshes past the ship as it flies] I don't know what they told you, but it wasn't all bad at first. We were the first ones to settle Etheria, to really study this planet's magic. [takes a breath] How could it go so wrong? You can't trust Light Hope. She's been reprogrammed to set off the weapon at any cost. The weapon...
[Scene shifts between perspectives as they are relevant]
Adora: The weapon! What is it?
Mara: I didn't know what they were doing until too late. I knew they were rerouting Etheria's magic for their own purposes...siphoning it, collecting it in the planet's core...
Adora: The Heart of Etheria...
Mara: The Heart of Etheria Project. It was supposed to be an energy source, capable of so much good...but that's not what they made. My people turned our planet, all of Etheria, into a weapon. And She-Ra is the key.
Adora: [stunned] ...What?
Mara: I opened a portal to a completely empty dimension and pulled Etheria in. I hid us from the rest of the universe, to keep everyone safe. This is the one place they'll never find us. The weapon can't hurt anyone else here. I saw what they would do...the deaths that would follow...I couldn't stop them before, but I can now. Hiding is our only option. [A shockwave shakes the ship as it flies around the magic spikes] Adora...this isn't over. The Heart of Etheria is still siphoning magic, storing it. It's unstable, it will tear Etheria apart if it goes off again. [Mara looks up as the ship flies straight up; Mara grunts in pain] So it's up to you now. I couldn't stop it. In the end, I wasn't strong enough. But you--Adora, you will be more powerful than they ever planned. [the ship abruptly stops and turns, plummeting back to the ground as it catches on fire; Mara grunts as the ship shakes and warnings pop up around her; Mara looks on, eyes widening with tears; she looks to smile at Adora] Adora...I believe in you. You can save the world we love.
[The hologram cuts out and glitches abruptly with a loud bang, power whirring down]
Adora: [quietly] ...The weapon... The weapon is Etheria. [with tears streaming] And Mara...[Bow steps up beside her] sacrificed herself to save everyone.
Razz: [steps up to the chair and laughs sadly, tears coming down] She was brave, my Mara. [sits the pie down on the chair] For you, Mara, dearie.
