Glimmer: Woohoo!
[Glimmer falls from the sky, landing safely in her mother's arms. Glimmer and her mother both laugh, and Glimmer teleports into the sky again, caught by her mother once again. They do this a few more times, until Angella flies Glimmer down from the sky, they land, laughing.]
Glimmer: That was awesome, Can we do it one more time?
Angella: Oh, that's quite enough for today, Besides-
[Micah enters the scene]
Micah: Did you two go flying without me?
Glimmer: Dad. You're back!
[Glimmer runs up to her dad then stops as he makes a spell in the air and throws it at her]
Micah: Think fast!
[Glimmer grabs the spell and makes it disappear, Laughing. Then she teleports into a hug with Micah]
Micah: You're getting good at that.
Glimmer: I've been practicing
[Glimmer lets go of Micah and turns to face Angella]
Angella: Yes, She only blew up my flower garden twice.
[Angella leans in and kisses Micah on the cheek]
Angella: Welcome home love.
Micah: You were having so much fun without me, you cant of missed me much.
[They all laugh and Micah pulls them into a family hug]
Guard: Your majesties!
[A guard runs up to them]
Guard: We found a girl sneaking into bright moon through the whispering woods. She was trying to break into the princess's chambers.
[Angella steps forward]
Angella: What? Please escort the princess safely to her room until we determine the trespassers intentions.
[Angella and Micah walk off and the guard grabs Glimmer and hurries her in the other direction, Glimmer looks back to see Adora in ropes being escorted through the front door of Bright moon, Adora looks up at Glimmer]
Adora: Glimmer!
[Glimmer looks back worriedly but keeps walking]
[Scene ends, Theme song plays]
[Bow enters the scene carrying tons of scrolls, he closes the door with his foot and wobbles, dropping the scrolls. He is wearing wide rimmed brown glasses, A long sleeve white t-shirt, and dark grey pant. Bow sighs then starts to pick up the scrolls]
[Glimmer teleports next to bow and he lets out a scream, dropping the scrolls he had picked up and falling over]
Bow: Glimmer! What is going on? Everyones really freaked out today!
Glimmer: Theres a trespasser in Bright moon! We need to figure out who she is!
[Glimmer grabs Bow and they teleport to the front of Bright moon, They look around a corner to see 4 guards guarding the entrance]
Bow: [Whispered] Why do we need to figure out who she is?
Glimmer: Because... I don't know! I just feel like I know her somehow! So, we're gonna and spy while my parents interrogate her!
Bow: [Almost yelling] What?!
[Glimmer quickly covers Bows mouth]
Glimmer: I know it sounds crazy, but she came here for a reason and I need to know why. If you want to stay behind, just tell me.
Bow: [Mumbling through Glimmers hand] I want to stay behind..
Glimmer: Hmm, Didn't hear anything, Lets go!
[They teleport to a ledge over looking the ballroom, Bow makes a nervous noise at how high up they are]
Angella: Bring in the prisoner!
[Adora steps forward and squints]
Adora: King Micah?! You're here? Oh, You look different then your mural.
[The guard pushes Adora down so she's on her knees and Adora grunts]
[King Micah stands and walks forward, he draws a spell in the air and pushes it over Adora]
Micah: This is a truth spell, You will be compelled to answer honestly. Now tell us, who are you and why did you break into Bright moon?
[Adora coughs]
Adora: Uh, Ok, wow, This is gonna be a lot to explain, um- [she clears her throat] and its going to sound a little weird but I swear its all true. Reality is collapsing in on itself because of the portal that Hordak and Catra set off. They're from the horde, Except you don't remember the horde because the fright zone disappeared [Adora laughs nervously] Like right now, It was pretty crazy. It got eraised by the portal but I promise it used to exist and we were fighting them with the Princess Alliance.
[Glimmer and bow look at each other in disbelief]
Adora: And I had a sword that could turn me into an 8 foot tall warrior lady with really great hair called She-ra
[Micah tilts his head in confusion and Angella squints down at Adora]
Adora: But the horde used the sword to set off the portal and I need Glimmer and Bow to help me stop it and save Etheria!
[Adora pants and drops her head]
Micah: i-.. Uh.
[Angella stands up, annoyed]
Angella: Who are you?! How do you know my daughter and the royal apprentice historian?
[Adora looks confused]
Adora: Hes a historian here? That doesn't matter, we're best friends.
Micah: I've never seen you before..
[Adora grimaces]
Adora: Well thats cause normally, you're dead
[Angella gasps]
[A guards swings their sword down so its right in front of Adora's face]
Guard: Are you threatening the king?!
[Angella steps forward and places her heads on Micah's shoulders]
Angella: How dare you say such a thing!
[Adora pushs the blade away from her face and looks up at Micah and Angella]
Adora: I'm sorry but none of this is right. You must have noticed it! What did you do yesterday, theres a reason you can't remember. This world isn't real! 
[Angella closes her eyes and puts her hand on her temple]
Angella: I have heard quite enough! 
[Angella turns away and starts walking back to her throne but Micah grabs her hand]
Micah: Angella, Its alright.
[Angellas face softens]
Adora: I need to talk to Bow and Glimmer! They're the strongest people I know!
[Angella and Micah turn back to look at Adora]
Adora: I need their help to stop reality falling apart!
[Angella facepalms and Micahs face hardens]
Micah: Guards, escort this young woman to our holding cell!
[The guards look at one another then back at Micah uneasily]
Micah: [Softly] The spare room.
{The guards nod and grab Adora, pulling her backwards, Adora struggles]
Adora: Wait! You have to believe me!
[Micah turns to look at Angella]
Micah: Don't listen to her, she's lying.
Angella: But your truth spell...
Micah: I must of done it wrong... Theres no way anything she said could be true. It's- It's not possible!
[Glimmer and Bow look at each other in worry and Glimmer teleports them away]
[Scene ends]
[Adora is standing in the spare room looking out the window, suddenly the world glitches, Steaks of light pink light coming out of the ground and the sky a shade of dark grey, Adora sighs and opens the note with *She ra* written on it. Adora sighs again as Bow and Glimmer teleport into the room]
[Glimmer groans and Bow steadies her then they both look up at Adora]
Adora: Bow! Glimmer! I knew you guys would-
[Adora starts to walk over to them but Glimmer blasts Adora with a bit of magic and Adora takes a step back]
Adora: Do you remember me at all?
Glimmer: Listen crazy lady! My dad has never messed up a spell, you were telling the truth in there, How can that be?
Adora:[Fondly] Of course you were listening in, I should've known.
Bow: [Angrily] Ok will you stop acting like you know us?! We've never met you!
Adora: Yes you have. 
[Adora walks closer to Bow and Glimmer]
Adora: Bow, You saved our lives more times then I can count. You're a great fighter, a genius inventer, and you shouldn't worry about what your dads think. They're proud of you, just like I am.
Adora: And Glimmer-
[Glimmer lets out a yelp and turns to face Adora]
Adora: You never give up or admit defeat, I know making friends is hard for you yet your the one who pulled us all together.
[Glimmer looks away]
Adora: I've never met anyone like you.
[Glimmer is quiet for a moment before she puts her hands in the air in frustration]
Glimmer: None of that is true! I'm just a princess, and Bow isn't a fighter, He's.. Bow.
[Bow gasps then clutches his navel area]
Bow: This-.. This isn't right.. I mean, everything is perfect. Everyone keeps saying everything's perfect.
[Glimmer gasps softly as she has a flashback to when she was little, standing in front of Micahs mural. Glimmer gasps again]
Glimmer: My dad... He's gone isn't he? 
[Bow steps towards Glimmer]
Adora: [sadly] yes..
[Bow and Adora both huddle around Glimmer while she closes her eyes]
[The castle rocks as an explosion is set off]
Bow, Glimmer, Adora: Woah!
[They all walk to the window and look out]
Bow: Uh, what is that?
[Theres a faint bright light on the horizen]
Adora: Oh no, It's starting to happen here too. We don't have much time. 
Glimmer: So, what do we do now?
Adora: We fix reality, uh, somehow.. Razz told me to go back to the beginning. But, I don't know what that means.
[She turns to face Bow and Glimmer]
Bow: Ok well, You said a portal started all of this, Can you think of anyone who'd know how to make a-
[Bow stops as he has flashbacks of Entrapta]
Bow: Entrapta...
Adora: Of course! Entrapta
[Adora looks back out the window]
Adora: Glimmer! Can you teleport us to Dryl?
[Glimmer looks surprised]
Glimmer: What? I barely managed to teleport me and Bow in here!
[Adora steps forwards and puts her hands on Bow and Glimmer's shoulders]
Adora: then we'll just have to do this the Best Friends Squad way!
[Scene ends]
[The doors to the spare room crash open and out run the Best Friends Squad, with Adora running in front of Glimmer and Bow, they're all holding hands while they run]
Adora: Run! Go. Go. Go!
[Bow screams]
Glimmer: This is how we normally do things?! 
[Adora looks back at Glimmer]
Adora: Yeah, We improvise!
Bow: [yelling] I really don't like improvising!
[Bow lets out a wail as Adora pulls them round a corner. Now Glimmer leads with Adora at the back]
Adora: Ok, we have to get out of Bright moon before it disappears like the Fright zone!
[Glimmer, Adora and Bow look out a window, this time the light is closer and the castle is shaking slightly. They all run faster, the world glitches and the windows disappear]
[They turn a corner and run straight into a guard. They all start to fall over but the guard grabs Glimmer's hand]
Guard: Princess, you shouldn't be-
[The guard looks over and see's Adora and Bow on the floor, Adora scrambles and hides behind Bow]
Guard: Is that the prisoner?!
[Glimmer shoots sparkles in the Guards face and Glimmer, Adora and Bow start running again]
Glimmer: Sorry!
[They keep running until they come to a cracked wall, Little bits a light pink are visible through the cracks]
Glimmer: There was a door here!
[Bow turns around]
Bow: [fearfully] Uh, Guys!?
[Glimmer and Adora turn around to see Angella and Micah blocking the only exit]
Angella: [Angrily] Step away from my daughter! Now! 
[Glimmer steps towards her parents as the world starts to crumble around them] 
Glimmer: Mum stop! Can't you see what happening? 
[Angella's eyes widen slightly as she has flashbacks of her and Glimmer, She blinks and suddenly see's the world crumbling around her, Micah comes up behind Angella] 
Micah: Angie? 
[Angella gasps and turns around to face Micah while the ceiling starts to crumble] 
Micah: Whats wrong? 
[Glimmer takes another step forward] 
Glimmer: I'm sorry, For everything. But we have to make this right 
[Glimmer tears up] 
[Adora, Bow and Glimmer scream as the floor beneath them crumbles and they are falling] 
Angella: Glimmer! 
[A flash a light pink light fills the screen and when it fades Angella is kneeling on the ground with Micah standing behind her] 
[The Best Friends Squad scream as they fall down a choute and land on the floor of Entrapta's lab, they all groan loudly as they hit the floor] 
Entrapta: Hello! 
[Adora, Bow and Glimmer look up to see Entrapta sitting down surrounded by her own robots, working on something, She turns around, She's wearing her normal clothes and has her mask on] 
Entrapta: Do I know you? 
[All the robots turn to face Adora, Bow and Glimmer] 
[Scene change] 
[Back at Bright moon, The castle is crumbling and streaks of light pink flow up from the ground, Angella stands on the edge of the Moonstone pad and looks down, She closes her eyes and sighs] 
Micah: Angie? 
[Micah comes up behind Angella, He grabs her hand and turns her to face him 
Micah: We'll get her back, Angie, and then everything will be perfect again. 
[Angella smiles sadly] 
Angella: This is perfect my love, but it's not real. 
[Angella puts her hand on the side of Micah's face, Micah looks sad] 
Angella: I remember now...       
[a bit of Bright moon tower crumbles]       
Angella: I miss you so much... But Glimmer needs my help, and I can't stay with nothing but memories.       
Micah: Angella I-... I-       
Angella: Goodbye Micah.       
[Angella kisses Micah before spreading her wings and flying off]       
Micah: Angie, Angella wait! I'm not-       
[the pink light fills the screen and Micah falls into it]       
[Angella flies away with her eyes closed and she wipes away a tear]       
[Scene change]       
[Dryl castle fills the screen, It looks dark and creepy, lightning strikes in the backround]       
[Robots pour tea for Adora, Glimmer and Bow, while a smaller robot gives Entrapta a fizzy orange drink with a straw]       
Entrapta: This is facinating! I've never had non-robots visit me before! Usually it's just me and all my friends.       
[Entrapta slurps noisily from her straw]       
Adora: [Shocked] Friends?       
[Bow looks at a robot and it blushs and turns away making an "ahh" noise, Bows eyes widen and he looks back at Entrapta]       
Entrapta: Aren't they amazing!?       
[Entrapta drops her now empty glass and straw on the floor and stands up, a nearby robot brings her a tray of food, Entrapta grabs the head of the robot and pulls it]       
Entrapta: And if they break, I can just make new friends!       
[Entrapta laughs loudly]       
Entrapta: Tiny snacks?       
[The robot uncovers the tray of food, which consists of mecanical parts like cogs and wires, the robot sprinkles some green glass on it, Glimmer, Adora and Bow watch in horror, then they shake their heads, The robot closes the tray and walks away]       
Entrapta: Oh, sorry about that. They're still getting the hang of human food. Unless this is what you eat! I have so many questions, Tell me everything!       
[Entrapta pushes herself forward with her hair and shoves a recorder in Adora's face, Adora pushes it away slightly]       
Adora: Entrapta, I know what i'm about to say sounds crazy-       
Entrapta: Is this about the unstable portal slowly consuming and warping our reality?       
Adora: Now you're not gonna believe- Wait, What did you just say?       
[Entrapta walks back to her main work bench and taps on a computer]       
Entrapta: Oh, I figured it out a while ago. An unstable portal is the only thing that would account for all the anomalies I've been picking up in my research. The portal exists somewhere in our world and as long as it's still open it's gonna keep to destablising reality, making things disappear faster and faster until, Bam! Nothing's left!       
[Entrapta uses her hair to propel herself at Bow, Glimmer and Adora]       
[Entrapta starts laughing then stops]       
Entrapta: Which is a bad thing...       
Adora: How do we stop it?       
[Adora takes a step forward towards Entrapta]       
Entrapta: Portals are gateways..       
[Entrapta turn and head back towards her computer]       
Entrapta: Wormholes that connect one area of space to another, The only way to turn it off is from the inside. But, who ever shuts down the portal can't leave. they'll be trapped between realities, possibly forever.       
[Entrapta shows a diagram]       
Entrapta: Oh! Imagine the data they could collect!       
Glimmer: Wait, so whoever turns it off will be trapped inside it forever?       
Entrapta: [facing away from Glimmer, Bow and Adora] Exactly.       
[Adora sighs]       
Adora: There must be another way! Try to remember Entrapta, when you and Hordak built the portal machine-       
[Entrapta gasps as she has flashbacks of Hordak]       
Entrapta: Remember...I.. remember, I had a lab partner, Hordak, we were friends and then Catra... [Sadly] Oh, I remember everything now...I'm not really here.       
[Entrapta gasps as the castle shakes, light pink cracks start running through the walls]       
Adora: No, No this can't be happening already. We should of had more time!       
Entrapta: [Thinking aloud] There is no more time, It all makes sense now, it's your sword, the portal is centred on you! It's following you!       
[The castle shakes as bits of cement fly into the air]       
Adora: What?       
[Entrapta smiles sadly before starting to fade, Adora rushes forward]       
Adora: No!       
[Adora rushes forward and tries to grab Entrapta, Her hands go straight threw her]       
Entrapta: You need to remove the sword from the inside, It's powering the portal       
[the ceiling above Glimmer and Bow's heads crack and they gasp]       
Entrapta: As soon as it's gone everything will be alright again! {sadly] It was nice being friends with you..       
[Entrapta fades]       
Adora: Entrapta, No!                                                               
Scene switches to the Crystal Castle
Glimmer: Where are we?
Adora: We're at the beacon. (gasps) Stars?
Glimmer: Adora, what is happening?
Adora: It's what Entrapta said. Reality is unraveling faster now. I – I think we might be too late. (gasps) Mara? Stay here. Entrapta said the portal is centered on me. You're at risk as long as we're together. If I draw it away –
Glimmer: No. I know what you're thinking, Adora. You said you knew us? Well, we know you.
Bow: You can't relax to save your life. You're terrible at acting.
Glimmer: You're stubborn and headstrong, and you're our best friend.
Adora: Wait, no.
Glimmer: You got this, Adora. We believe in you.
[Glimmer and Bow fade away]
Adora (weeps)
Catra: Hey, Adora.
Scene switches to cantina
Catra: Oh... Where are your friends?
Adora: Catra, stop. You have to--
Catra: It's always the same with you, Adora. “I have to do this. Oh, we have to do that.” Let's be honest, all of this is your fault.
Scene switches to the Northern Reach
Catra: If you hadn't gotten captured, your sword wouldn't have opened the portal. If you hadn't gotten the sword and been the world's worst She-Ra, none of this would've happened. [pushes Adora off cliff]
Adora (shouts)
scene switches to ocean outside Seaworthy
Catra: Admit it, Adora, the world would still be standing if you had never come through that portal in the first place.
Scene switches to Crystal Castle, then to the Fright Zone
Catra: You made me this. You took everything from me.
Scene switches to Mara's ship
Catra: You broke the world, and it is all your fault.
Adora: No, it's not.
Scene switches to the tear in reality
Adora: I didn't make you pull the switch. I didn't make you do anything. I didn't break the world, but I am gonna fix it. And you? You  made your choice. Now live with it.
Catra (shrieks)
[Adora and Catra fall into the tear Catra fades away]
Queen Angella: Adora!
Adora (gasps)
Queen Angella: Hold on!
[Queen Angella carries Adora to a grassy plane outside the tear]
Queen Angella: I remember, Adora. I know this world isn't our own. How do we fix this?
[Sword of Protection (hums) inside the portal]
Adora: Go back to the beginning. Razz meant my beginning. The the place I came through as a baby. I can fix everything. I just need to go into the portal and pull out the sword. That'll turn it off and everyone will come back safe and sound.
Queen Angella: And you'll come back safe, too? Adora, you'll come back, too, right?
Adora: I have to do this. This is my destiny.
Queen Angella: Oh, Adora, no. This is not it.
Adora: But... this is the only way to fix things.
Queen Angella: Do you want to know a secret? I am a coward.
Adora: What? No.
Queen Angella: I've always been the queen who stays behind. Micah was the brave one. And then Glimmer... Oh, Glimmer. So much like her father. And once again I stayed behind, letting her make the hard choices, letting her be brave for me. I told myself I was being responsible, but, Adora, I was just scared. And then I met you. You inspired us. You inspired me. Not because it was your destiny, but because you never let fear stop you. And now I choose to be brave.
Adora (gasps) : No! Your Majesty! Angella!
[Queen Angella flies to the Sword]
Queen Angella: Take care of each other.
[Queen Angella pulls the Sword out of the portal.  The portal closes and the Sword floats down to Adora]
Adora (cries) :For the honor of Grayskull!
Scene switches to Hordak's sanctum, in normal time
all (exclaim)
[portal machine powers up]
Catra: Huh?
[She-Ra walks through the portal machine]
She-Ra (shouts) [smashes the portal machine]
Catra: We have to go now.
Hordak (grunts)
Bow and Glimmer: Adora.
Glimmer: See? We told you, you could do it.
Frosta: Woo-hoo! Yes, we did it. We did it.
Shadow Weaver: Touching as this is, we need to go. Now!
[Shadow Weaver casts magic]
Glimmer (grunts)
[the heros transport to Bright Moon]
all: laugh and shout
Bow: We did it. Did we do it? We did it.
Glimmer: I'm probably going to be grounded for the rest of my life, but reality is back to normal. Speaking of which, I guess I should go find my mom. Maybe she'll be so happy to see me that she'll forget about grounding me. Adora? What is it?
[She-Ra transforms into Adora, hugs Glimmer, starts crying]
Adora: Angella, she stayed behind. She – She –
Glimmer (weeps)
Adora: She saved us.
Scene switches to space station
console (beeps)
Horde Prime: So, that's where you've been, little brother.
