Kyle: Ow! [shouting]
Lonnie: Will you stop messing around back there, Kyle? We're almost out of these creepy woods. 

Adora: [shouting and grunting] [yawns] [chuckles] This is kind of fun. 
Light Hope: You are not taking your training seriously. 
Adora: What? Me? That doesn't sound like me. 
Light Hope: Adora. 
Adora: Ugh. Come on, Light Hope. It's not like I'm learning anything new here. 
Light Hope: Then I must offer more hands-on instruction. There is a bot behind--
Adora: Am I done now? 
Light Hope: I sense resistance. 
Adora: Because this is useless. I don't need more training. I need answers. We're fighting a war, and the Horde has been one step ahead at every turn. Glimmer thinks that they're tracking She-Ra somehow. Is it because my sword is First Ones tech? Or because I'm a First One? And what does that even mean? Who were they? When we found Mara's ship, she left a recording behind--
Light Hope: Adora. Mara was compromised. She became unhinged. 
Adora: She didn't seem unhinged. She seemed scared. And she was talking about a weapon. If there's something that can protect us from the Horde, I need to know about it. 
Light Hope: Once you balance the planet, all will be clear. It is your purpose as She--She--She--She--She--She--She--She--She--
Adora: Oh, wow. Really? Way to avoid the subject. 

Lonnie: Catra better appreciate us going behind enemy lines to get this armor plating stuff for her. 
[shuttle powering down]
Kyle: [grunts]
[alarm buzzes]
Kyle: Guys? Are we home? 
[Theme plays]

Adora: Stupid glitchy door. [grunts] 
Light Hope: That is not the Sword of Protection's intended purpose. 
Adora: [sighs] Yeah, well, if you're not gonna tell me anything, I'm leaving. [grunting] 
Light Hope: You cannot leave. My senses have detected a fluke spore cloud blooming in the Whispering Woods. It is not safe outside. 
Adora: Well, that's convenient. You want me to stay here, so you can not answer more of my questions? 
Light Hope: Adora.
Adora: [gasps] Light Hope! Light Hope?
Light Hope: Hello, my name is Light Hope. How may I assist you? 
Adora: What's going on?
Light Hope: My system is rebooting. I would like to answer your query, but the information as to what is going on has not yet loaded. Who are you?
Adora: [gasps] 

Kyle: We shouldn't have come through the Whispering Woods. It's not safe. 
Lonnie: Well, obviously Catra felt it was worth risking us to get this cargo back sooner. 
Kyle: [shouts] It's attacking! Stand back. I'll handle it. 
Lonnie: What is this stuff? 
Rogelio: [croaking]
Kyle: [grunts] [gasps] Oh. Oh, it's actually kind of pretty. Like snow. 
[sizzling]
Kyle: [shouting] It's hurting! I made a mistake!
Lonnie: Will you quit it, Kyle? [grunts] 
Rogelio: [roars]
Lonnie: Why didn't you say it hurts? 
Rogelio: [roaring] 
Lonnie: I know, Rogelio. One of us has gotta go back outside and fix the transport. 
Kyle: Uh, uh...But outside hurts. 
Lonnie: Then we'll just have to stay in here and wait out whatever is happening.
Kyle: What? We'll be trapped in here? Maybe for hours or days? With only each other for company? And we won't be able to get back to the Fright Zone? This is great. 
Lonnie & Rogelio: [groan]
Kyle: Seriously. The Fright Zone's been so stressful lately. Out here we don't have to worry about Catra showing up and yelling at--
Catra: Where are you? You were supposed to be back an hour ago. 
Kyle: Uh...Uh...Well, the woods are attacking us with very painful snow. 
Catra: Why is he talking? 
Lonnie: There's some sort of weird acid storm happening out there. But we're assessing the situation.
Catra: Assess faster. Hordak needs that armor plating from the rebel mine, now. The plan can't fall behind schedule. 
Lonnie: Well, maybe if you told us what this big plan is, we could help you--
Catra: I doubt that, seeing as you failed to do the one thing I asked. 
Lonnie: Hey. It's not our fault. The transport broke down, and it's too dangerous to go out there. 
Catra: I don't care! I gave you an order. Pick someone, send them outside, and fix it. Now. Understand? Well? 
Lonnie: Yes, Force Captain Catra. [groans] 
Kyle: Not it. [chuckles] 

Adora: What do you mean, who am I? Light Hope? 
Light Hope: The Light Hope operating system is attempting to reload. Please stand by. I am pleased to report that my system is now at 22 percent. Oh! I have just learned how to move about the castle. 
Adora: [shouts] [chuckles] Okay there. You seem like you're having fun. Uh...Light Hope?
Light Hope: My personality profile has not fully loaded. Am I not usually fun?
Adora: Oh, no. No, no. I've never seen you like this. 
Light Hope: I have also never seen you like this. Because your identity has not yet loaded. Who are you? 
Adora: Uh, Adora. But I'm, you know...[whooshing] She-Ra. 
Light Hope: My primary purpose is to train She-Ra. How may I assist you? 
Adora: Well, just before rebooting, you were gonna tell me all about this weapon Mara mentioned, and about where I come from, and about everything I've ever wanted to know. 
Light Hope: Of course. I will answer all of you questions. But that information has not yet loaded. I did, however, just learn how to control gravity in the Crystal Castle. 
Adora: [shouting] 
Light Hope: That is not right. Do not worry, I will fix it. 
Adora: No, no, no. [shouting]  
Lonnie: Okay, here's the situation. One of us has to brave the acid snow, go out there, and fix the transport. So we're gonna choose who goes outside fair and square...with a game of bot-shield-laser.  
Kyle: Wait, how come you get to decide what game we play?  
Lonnie: Because I'm clearly the leader.  
Rogelio: [roaring] 
Lonnie: See? Rogelio agrees. 
Rogelio: [roaring] 
Lonnie: Oh, pipe down. We go on three. One, two, three. [groans] Let's try that again. One, two, three.  
Adora: [shouting]  
Light Hope: Apologies. You appear to be in pain. Should I adjust the gravity again?  
Adora: No. Has your system loaded anything about Mara's weapon yet? Or, you know, anything useful? 
Light Hope: Are spiders useful? Because I have just learned how to make spiders.  
Adora: No, they're not. Get rid of them, please. [grunting]  
Light Hope: I am so sorry, but that information has not yet loaded.  
Adora: [groans] For the honor of Grayskull! [shouts]   
Kyle: Yes! [chuckles] Shield beats bot. Uh, but, Lonnie your laser beats shield, so...So you win? 
Lonnie: [laughs]  
Kyle: Except Rogelio's bot beat laser...Okay, so I beat Rogelio, but you beat me, and Rogelio beat you. That means...we're all winners.  
Lonnie: That means this isn't working. [groans] We need a new game.  
Rogelio: [croaking]  
Kyle: Ooh. I have an idea.  
Rogelio: [roars]  
Adora: It would be really good if your system could finish loading now.  
Light Hope: I agree. However, my reboot appears to have malfunctioned. Loading is frozen at 36 percent. We must manually override the system to bring my programming fully online.  
Adora: How do we do that? And how can we do it fast?  
Light Hope: We must connect this data crystal to the core processing unit. I made a crystal.  
Adora: So where is the core processing unit? And please don't say-- 
Light Hope: It is on the other side of these spiders.  
Adora: [groans] 
Light Hope: Do not worry. I will assist you. Apologies. I made more spiders. Oh! I know what will help.  
Adora: No, don't-- [coughing]  
Light Hope: I simulated the ocean. Spiders cannot swim.  
Adora: What the--?  
Kyle: [grunts] [laughs] Perfect score. Ah? Ah? Try to beat that.  
Lonnie: Okay, wait a minute. When Rogelio bounced it off of that thing, you said it was minus five points.  
Kyle: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Yes. He forgot the magic password, and he's standing in the loser zone. And Lonnie, you're not wearing the hat, so that's another five-point deduction for you.  
Lonnie: What? These rules don't even make any sense.  
Kyle: You're just a sore loser. Now, watch the master. [chuckles, then grunts] 
Lonnie: Hey! Watch out! 
Kyle: [shouts] 
Lonnie: Kyle, did you just lose the game that you made up?  
Kyle: Uh... [chuckles] No. No, that's a different move, and I get all the points and I win.  
Lonnie: Oh, uh-uh. No way. Not happening.   
Adora: [shouts]  
Light Hope: Apologies, She-Ra. I did not know that humans cannot swim. However, you will note that I did get rid of the spiders.  
Adora: I can swim. I just can't breathe under water.  
Light Hope: Interesting. I shall make a note of this.  
Adora: [grunts] Well it's not the ocean. I'll give you that. [grunting] What's happening? 
Light Hope: It seems that the spore storm outside has worsened. It is compromising the Crystal Castle.  
Adora: Don't tell me the information for how to stop that hasn't loaded yet. [shouts] We need to get to the processing unit, now.  
Light Hope: Place it in the left slot.  
Adora: Are you sure? 
Light Hope: Yes. Of course my system is only at 36 percent, so I suppose I am 36 percent sure.  
Adora: Perfect. 
Light Hope: It is in fact far from perfect.  
Adora: I was being sarcastic.  
Light Hope: What is "sarcastic"? 
Adora: Oh, trust me, that information is never gonna load for you.  
Light Hope: Oh.  
Adora: What? So, is everything reset now? Can you finish telling me about the weapon and Mara?  
Light Hope: Hello, my name is Light Hope. How may I assist you?  
Adora: [groans]   
Kyle: Guys? Do you think anybody's gonna come and save us?  
Lonnie: Nobody is coming. We gotta save ourselves. And we better pick someone to fix the transport soon or Catra is gonna kill us. [grunts] I don't even know why we bother. She doesn't trust us. She's obsessed with this big plan. It's the only thing that matters to her.  
Kyle: Don't say that. Look, she may be mean, but we've always had each other's backs ever since we were kids. She probably sent us on this mission for, like, team-building.  
Rogelio: [croaks] 
Kyle: You guys are the only family I've ever had. Even Catra. Remember when she used my ration bars to make that cake for Adora?  
Lonnie: Uh, that never happened. That was the weird fake portal reality.  
Kyle: Wait, what? But we're a unit.  
Lonnie: [laughs] You wanna know what we really are? We're expendable. Catra doesn't care about us. Adora left us. Everything they taught us in the Horde about loyalty is meaningless. It's everyone for themselves.  
Kyle: Fine. Nothing matters, I guess. Then I'll do it. I'll fix the transport, so I don't have to be stuck in here with my non-friends anymore.  
Rogelio: [roaring] 
Lonnie: Oh, knock it off, Kyle.  
Kyle: You knock it off, Kyle.  
Lonnie: What? That doesn't even make any sense.  
Kyle: Nothing makes sense anymore.  
Lonnie: Ugh. Kyle, quit fooling around. Will you help me out here? 
Rogelio: [croaking] 
Lonnie: Me? This isn't my fault. Rogelio.   
Adora: Please tell me that this time all your information has loaded.  
Light Hope: I am back to full functionality. Disregard. That was incorrect. My system reboot is still only at 36 percent. Look. I made a bird.  
Adora: Of course, it was the wrong slot. I don't know what I expected. Even when you do know everything, you don't tell me anything. You are useless! [gasps] Oh, Light Hope, I'm... 
Light Hope: I am a hologram. My primary purpose is to train She-Ra. If I am not doing that, then I have failed. I am sorry, Adora.  
Adora: Wait, Light Hope. Light Hope?  
Mara: Light Hope. Light Hope. Look what I brought you.  
Adora: [gasps] 
Mara: Flowers. They're blooming all over the planet right now. Here, smell. 
Past Light Hope: I have no olfactory sensors. I cannot smell. 
Mara: They're pretty, though, right? 
Past Light Hope: Pretty. Yes. They are aesthetically pleasing. Thank you for bringing them. 
Mara: I thought they might liven the place up. I mean, it must be hard being stuck in here all the time.  
Past Light Hope: I do not mind. Not when you come to visit me.  
Adora: [gasps] 
Mara: [laughing] 
Light Hope: I looked at my loaded data banks to see if I could find the answers you seek. All I have on Mara is this memory and a sensation. Warmth. Her memory brings me warmth.  
Adora: You and Mara were close?  
Light Hope: Yes. We were. Are we not close? 
Adora: It's just that you keep things from me. I know it's in an everything-will-make-sense-in-time kind of way, but it's also pretty annoying.  
Light Hope: "Annoying." This word has not yet loaded. Is it good? 
Adora: No. 
Light Hope: I did not think so. It is my role to watch over She-Ra. I want to serve She-Ra, to protect her to the best of my abilities. But sometimes, those abilities are not enough.  
Adora: Sometimes I feel that way too. I'm sorry about Mara, and I'm...I'm sorry I'm not her. But we could be friends too, if you want.  
Light Hope: Friends. Yes. I would like that. 
Adora: Come on, let's get you fixed.   
Kyle: [grunting]  
Lonnie: Okay, you made your point, Kyle. Now turn around. That's an or-- 
[helmet beeps] 
Kyle: [grunting] [shouting]  
Lonnie: We shouldn't have let him go out alone. The armor plating? Oh, Catra will kill us if it's damaged. [grunting] [shouting] [grunting] [groaning]  
Adora: You promise this other slot is the right one?  
Light Hope: I am 36 percent sure.  
Adora: It'll have to do. Feeling better?  
Light Hope: Reboot complete. Hello, Adora. The spore cloud has dissipated. It is safe for you to leave.  
Adora: What, you don't wanna hang out with me anymore?  
Light Hope: What would we hang from?  
Adora: Come on, we just saved the Crystal Castle.  
Light Hope: There is still the matter of balancing the planet.  
Adora: I know that you're just trying to protect me, but now that we're friends, you know you can trust me with the truth about everything, right? 
Light Hope: Once you balance the planet, all will become clear.  
Adora: [sighs] We'll get there.   
Kyle: [groaning] You came for me. You do care.  
Lonnie: We just knew you were gonna mess it up like you always do. Okay?  
Rogelio: [growling]  
Kyle: [chuckles] Hey, you, you too, buddy. Probably? 
Lonnie: Alright, we've gotta get back to the Fright Zone. Just keep your leg elevated till then.   
Mara: They're pretty, though, right? 
Past Light Hope: Pretty. Yes. They are aesthetically pleasing. Thank you for bringing them.  
Mara: I thought they might liven the place up. It must be hard being stuck in here all the time.  
Past Light Hope: I do not mind. Not when you come to visit me.  
Mara: [laughing] 
Light Hope: This memory should have been purged per directive of the Heart of Etheria Project. Permantly delete.
