[View of Crystal Castle; Emily plays in grass]
[Emily rolls over Shadow Weaver's flowrers; Shadow Weaver speaks to Scorpia]
Shadow Weaver: Please keep your bot out of my flower beds.
Scorpia: Oh! Oh, sorry about that.
[Scorpia turns in Emily's direction]
Scorpia: Emily! Emily, come here!
[Crashes from Emily in the distance]
Scorpia: No! Not in the skull plant things!
[Scorpia catching up to Shadow Weaver]
Scorpia: So uh, they let you have your own garden here? Aren't you a prisoner? Am I prisoner? Everyone's been so nice. How come we're not, you know, in a prison? Is this garden a prison?
[Shadow Weaver kneeling by a bush with gardenning scissors]
Shadow Weaver: It wasn't, until today.
Scorpia: Oh! Heh, heh! Right, right, sorry!
[Scorpia walking away slowly]
Scorpia: I-I'm not even here! Just a garden away..
[Shadow Weaver about to make a delicate cut to a bush branch; Scorpia shouts at a troublesome Emily, resulting in Shadow Weaver slipping and cutting the wrong part of the branch]
Scorpia: Emily! What did I just say? I said, stay out of the skull plants!
[Shadow Weaver, annoyed; groans]
Scorpia: Bad bot! Bad! I said, drop it!
[Glimmer walks into the scene]
Glimmer: Scorpia!
[Emily crashes]
Shadow Weaver: Your majesty, you're back. Did you find what you were looking for?
Glimmer: Yes. Light Hope told me everything I need to know, and I have a plan.
Shadow Weaver: A plan? Excellent, we should discuss-
[Glimmer walks away from Shadow Weaver; instead towards Scorpia]
Glimmer: Scorpia, I need your help.
Scorpia: Me?
Glimmer: You're the only person who can save Etheria. We need you to reconnect to the Black Garnet. 
Shadow Weaver: What? Your majesty, I don't understand. We should reconvene with the other princesses and-
Glimmer: The other princesses are gone. But it's fine!
Shadow Weaver: Gone?
Glimmer: I said it's fine. I have a plan-
Scorpia: Gone where?
Glimmer: Okay, would anyone else like to interrupt me?
[A gaurd from behind clears her throat, getting their attention]
Gaurd: I'm sorry your majesty, but Double Trouble has escaped.

[Opening scene]

[New scene: Entrapta rides Adora, Bow, Swift Wind, and Micah in her bot on Beast Island]
Entrapta: Wow, I can't believe we're all here on Beast Island at the same time. What an incredible coincidence. 
Bow: Uh... It's not a coincidence. We came to find you.
[Entrapta pulls out her recorder]
Entrapta:Beast Island Log, tide cycle 37. I have confirmed that the outside world still exists. I founded princesses! Well, one princess, some sort of horse bird-hybrid, Bow, and...
[Entrapta sniffs a squished Micah]
Entrapta: I don't know you.
Micah: Yes you do. You stole my food.
Entrapta: Oh yeah! It was delicious!
[Entrapta sitting down once again]
Entrapta: Wasn't there another one of you?
Bow: Yes. Glimmer. You know her. And she's... not here.
Swift Wind: Can we talk about how I'm not a bird?
Adora: Entrapta, we have been looking all over on this island for you. Are you ok?
[Entrapta somewhat confused]
Entrapta: Of course I'm ok! Have you seen this place? An Island, full of technological monstrosities, each more deadly than the next? Its paradise!
[Entrapta squishes Bow more with her feet]
Bow: Yeah, um, glad you're having fun, but we're kind of here to rescue you?
Entrapta: Rescue me? Did I not just rescue you?
Adora: Yeah.. that didn't go as planned.
Bow: We came to bring you back.We would've come sooner, but we had no idea you were here. We though you were still with Hordak.
[Entrapta, sad to hear Hordak's name, puts on her mask]
Bow: Scorpia told us what happened. She and the other princesses are waiting for you at Bright Moon.
[Bot comes to an abrupt stop, Entrapta silent]
Adora: Entrapta, please. We need your help. We discovered what the First Ones and what they were doing to Etheria, a terrible secret that no one else knows. 
[Entrapta lifts off mask with her hair, eyes sparkling with excitement]
Entrapta: You mean The Heart of Etheria? Why didn't you just say so?
[Entrapta starts the bot up again]
[Scene changes to Catra splashing her face with water inside a Horde locker room]
[Kyle, Lonnie, and Rogelio walk in laughing]
Lonnie: Sorry. We didn't know you were in here. We'll just come back later.
Catra: Wait.
Catra: What's the report from the field?
Lonnie: We just got back from conquering another rebel town! The third one this week. So, you're welcome.
Kyle: Ah, you should've seen us! I was all:
[Kyle mimics gunshots]
Kyle: And then Rogelio, he was all:
[Kyle imitates Rogelio's roar, kicking a drawing of Scorpia, Entrapta, and Catra in the process]
Catra: Watch it!
Lonnie: Calm down Catra! It's not like Scorpia needs it anymore.
Catra: You don't get to talk to me like that. I'm your commander. Got it?
Lonnie: What is wrong with you? We're winning! Even you should be happy.
Catra: Happy?
[Catra shoves Lonnie against a locker]
Catra: I'll be happy when the Rebellion and She-Ra are gone for good! But that's never going to happen with the three of you goofing off all the time. You are pathetic!
[Lonnie pushes Catra off of her]
[Catra draws her claws out]
Kyle: Stay away from her!
[Catra backs away]
Kyle: We used to be your friends. Why are you treating us like this?
Catra: Get out!
[Kyle, Rogelio, and Lonnie leave]
[Catra balls up the drawing of Her, Scorpia and Entrapta, throws it and presses her head against a locker]
Double Trouble: Ouch! It's worse than I thought. You're a mess.
Catra: Double Trouble? Y-You came back? I mean, where were you? I thought um-
[Double Trouble grabs Catra face]
Double Trouble: You thought I left you?
[Catra hisses and pulls away]
Double Trouble: Apologies for the delay, Kitten. I got held up in Bright Moon. But don't worry, I brought something that might cheer you up.
Catra: Better be something good after all that.
Double Trouble: The time to strike the final blow to the Rebellion is upon us. The princesses aren't getting along, and most deliciously, She-Ra is gone.
Double Trouble: So..
Catra: Bright Moon is unprotected.
Double Trouble: Told you it would cheer you up.
[Scene changes to Bright Moon]
Shadow Weaver: We must find Double Trouble at once. They know too much! We can't let them return to the Fright Zone!
Glimmer: Forget Double Trouble. They don't matter anymore. The only person we need is right here.
Shadow Weaver: Scorpia is not a true princess. She has never shown any connection to her Runestone.
Glimmer: But she will, as soon as we get her to the Black Garnet.
Shadow Weaver: Get her to the Black Garnet? Your majesty, you're not thinking this through. You cannot go to the Fright Zone now! You are without allies, without your prisoner, and without a plan!
Glimmer: I have a plan!
Shadow Weaver: My queen, listen to me. Think. Have I not only tried to help you?
Shadow Weaver: You are letting your emotions get the better of you. This plan is too risky. What would your mother say if she were here?
Glimmer: You don't get to talk to me about my mother. Besides. You, were the one who told me to decide what kind of queen I am. And I've decided. I'm the queen who's going to save Etheria.
[Glimmer walks away Shadow Weaver following]
Shadow Weaver: My queen.
[Guards block Shadow Weaver from coming, and slam the door after Glimmer]
[Scene changes to the Fright Zone, lots of soldiers preparing for battle]
[Catra is shown monitoring it all]
[Hordak walks towards her]
Hordak: What is the meaning of this?
Catra: Oh sorry, I though you wanted to defeat the Rebellion. Because this is what that looks like.
Hordak: We are already spread thin from occupying so much territory.
Catra: We're occupying plenty. But not Bright Moon. Not yet. Double Trouble reported in. The princesses are in chaos, She-Ra is gone, and without their precious hero to protect the castle, well..
Hordak: we can strike the final blow to the Rebellion. When Bright Moon falls we will control all of Ehteria.
Catra: Big brothers going to be so impressed.
Hordak: Yes. This will show him what I am capable of. What we are capable of. Good work, Catra.
Hordak: Victory is ours.
[Scene changes, to Entrapta driving her bot across Beast Island]
[The signal from the Island grows louder]
Swift Wind: I don't like it here. The signal, it's getting louder again. I think we should go.
Micah: The talking horse is right. We should stay away. No one ever comes back from this part of the island.
Entrapta: Don't worry about the signal, it's better inside.
Bow: Inside where?
[Entrapta bolts into a web of hanging moss]
Bow: Wha-
Entrapta: Somewhere...
[Entrapta springs back out of the moss]
Entrapta: Aha! Ta da!
[Entrapta pulls back the hanging moss, revealing a passage]
Entrapta: Come on! You're going to love it.
[Everyone walks inside]
Swift Wind: Wow, this place is terrible. I hate it.
Adora: It's a First Ones Temple.
Entrapta: Isn't it amazing? The First Ones tried to their secrets by dumping them on Beast Island! The answers I've been looking for, they're all here!
[Entrapta powers up a machine console]
Entrapta: My theories were correct. I knew the First Ones had retrofitted the planet with tech, I just didn't know why. But it all makes sense now! They were mining the planet's magic, using it to power their weapon, The Heart of Ehteria!
[Entrapta speaking to Adora]
Entrapta: But of course you know all about The Heart of Etheria already, seeing as you're apart of it.
Adora: Wait, wait. Hang on. What?
Entrapta: All the princesses are. Hang on, I'll show you.
[Entrapta changes the machine's screen to show an image of Etheria and all of its Runestones]
Entrapta: The Heart draws its power from the magic of the princesses. It needs all their Runestones engaged to work. And She-Ra is the most important piece, the key! She channels the weapon's power and focuses it.
[Machine screen changes to an old video of Mara being given The Sword of Power]
Entrapta: She-Ra is the only being strong enough to withstand the destructive energy of The Heart.
[Video shows Mara being overtaken by the power of The Heart]
Entrapta: So the First Ones made the sword to control her, to use her.
Entrapta: When The Heart is deployed, She-Ra will raise her sword and fire it!
Adora: She-Ra is the key.. That means I can stop it, right? If She-Ra fires the weapon, then I just won't do it.
Adora: Please, Entrapta, tell me I can stop it!
Entrapta: Once the planet is balanced, no one can stop it. Not even the First Ones could control it. That's why they left. When the weapon is activated it will channel all its power into you. You don't get to refuse.
[Adora starts panicking, panting and staring at the old footage of Mara]
Bow: But Etheria isn't balanced yet. Look! There's still one Runestone offline. We might still have a chance. Wait.
Bow: The Black Garnet. Scorpia.
Adora: Scorpia's with the Rebellion. You don't think Glimmer would-?
Bow: There's no way she would know Scorpia's the final piece. Right?
Adora: We have to get back to Bright Moon.
[Scene changes to Bright Moon; Glimmer rushing to Scorpia's room]
Glimmer: Scorpia! We need to go to the Black Garnet chamber now. My plan is going to work!
[Scorpia is hidden in a pile of pillows, her tail poking out at the top. Emily wavers around]
Glimmer: What's wrong? I thought you would want to be a princess?
Scorpia: Ok. I have been considering, I really appreciate the offer, but, I only came here to help Entratpa. I left the Horde, but I'm not gonna betray them. Or Catra.
Glimmer: This will save them. Horde Prime could be here at any moment. If he shows up and we're not ready to defend ourselves, everyone loses. Do you really think he'll need to keep Catra around?
[Scorpia gets out of her pillow pile and sits down, Glimmer sits down next to her]
Glimmer: We both want to save the people we love. But I can't do it without you.
Scorpia: It's hopeless.. What if the Black Garnet doesn't want me? I just.. kind of get rejected a lot.
Glimmer: Tell me about it. My best friends left me. Even before this, I was the weak princess, the one who had to recharge. Who didn't fit. But that's changed now. We've changed now. We're stronger than anyone knows. We can do this. We can save everyone.
Scorpia: Everyone?
Glimmer: You're not hopeless. You were born for this. And I'll help you. We're in this together. You're going to make a great princess.
[Scorpia hugs Glimmer]
Scorpia: Sorry, that was probably too much. Oh wow still going.
Scorpia: I'm in. So what now?
Glimmer: Now, we go to save the world.
[Scene changes back to Beast Island, everyone rushing out of the ruins Entrapta had shown them]
Micah: What's going on, is Glimmer in danger?
Bow: She might be. We have to get back as soon as we can.
Micah: We're going home now? That's great! Wait, should I bring something back for Glimmer? What does she like? Does she like bugs?
Swift Wind: Oh, Micah. No one likes bug.
Entrapta: Have a good trip. Come again soon!
Adora: Entrapta, no. You're coming with us.
[Vines start to grow towards Entrapta as she succumbs to the signal]
Entrapta: This place.. It's pure information. Everything I've ever dreamed of knowing about the planet, it's all here. So I'm staying.
[Adora rushes to Entrapta]
Adora: No. We're not going to leave you.
[The Signal drones]
Swift Wind: Oh, this is not good.
Entrapta: Everything back there with the princesses and then... with Hordak.. was so.. confusing. I just wasn't suited for friendship. I belong here.
[Vines wrap around Entrapta]
Bow: Entrapta, please! Fight it!
[Bow tears off a piece of the vines on Entrapta, even after, the vine wiggles around as if it's alive]
Adora: For the honor of Grayskull!
[Adora transforms into She-ra and tears Entrapta away from the vine's grasp]
She-Ra: Head for the ship!
[Micah blasts open the entrance with a spell]
Micah: This way!
[Pookahs and other creatures surround the group]
[Entrapta tries to push away from She-Ra]
Entrapta: Just leave me!
[She-Ra puts Entrapta down then fights the monster]
[Bow and Micah shoot the monsters]
[One monster dodges and leaves Micah with a painful bite on his lower leg]
[A ginormous snake like monster appears and smashes the bridge, leaving the team to fall further into the island's depths. They land]
[The snake like monster follows them and attempts to bash the group, but Micah creates a force field just in time]
[Entrapta succumbs to the signal]
Bow: Entrapta, no! The island is affecting you. You can't give in!
Entrapta: You don't understand, that's ok.. no one understands me.. I tried to be a good friend. But I didn't understand that either.
Bow: What? Did you think friendship was easy? It takes work to be there for other people! It takes everything you've got.
Entrapta: Everyone leaves me behind.. why should it be any different now?
Bow: Because we're not ever going to leave you behind again! And we never gave up on you, even when you were with the Horde! Because that's what friends do.
Entrapta: You haven't.. given up on me?
[The force field breaks]
She-ra: We're out of time!
She-ra: Entrapta, we flew here on an ancient First Ones ship. Do you want to see it or not?
[Entrapta immediately stands up, as her normal self, no longer succumbed to the signal]
Entrapta: A ship? You have a First Ones spacecraft? A First Ones spacecraft that works??
[Entrapta shouts excitedly]
Entrapta: I WANNA SEE!
Swift Wind: Uh, hate to interrupt, but theres more monsters coming.. Like a lot more!
[More giant snake monsters emerge]
[Entrapta whistles loudly]
[Entrapta's robot from earlier jumps down and roars]
Bow: Did anything I said about friendship work for you? Or was it all the ship?
Entrapta: Oh definitely the ship. But, thank you. I'm-I'm glad we're friends.
She-ra: Guys, we really have to go!
Swift Wind: To the ship!
[Entrapta waves to her robot]
Entrapta: Get em' girl! I'll be back for you, I promise!
[Her robot gives a thumbs up, and continues attacking robots, allowing the group to escape]
[Scene changes to the Fright Zone; in Hordak's sanctum]
[Hordak test out his new weapon, he points it to She-Ra]
She-Ra: No.. You got me!
[She-ra lays on Hordak's table pretending to be dead]
[She-ra turns out to be Double Trouble]
Double Trouble: Ugh I know, I know.. No one's welcome in Hordak's super-secret sanctum
Double Trouble: Not since you let that princess in...
[Double Trouble shape-shifts their hair into Entrapta's]
[Hordak growls]
[Double Trouble sneers]
Double Trouble: What makes something a sanctum, anyways?
[Double Trouble looks at Hordak's new weapon]
Double Trouble: No small talk? I thought I'd at least get a pat on the back for my daring escape.
[Double Trouble steps on Imps' tail [it screeches]]
Double Trouble: It's too bad though..
[Double Trouble transforms the tip of their tail to look like Imp's while they talk]
Double Trouble: I was looking forward to meeting this Entrapta character before I left Bright Moon. But of course, as you know , she wasn't there.
Hordak: What did you say?
Double Trouble: Oh, no need keep up the charade with me. I figured out the truth. You had Catra send Entrapta to Beast Island, so She-Ra would run off to rescue her.
Double Trouble: A brilliant idea! The perfect distraction. I have to applaud your work, you really had me going.
Double Trouble: So scorned by Entrapta's betrayal.... Even now you look like you had no idea!
Double Trouble: Brava. I mean, I did consider the alternative... That Catra's been lying to you this whole time.
Double Trouble: That she made you think she was your partner in crime, while really she is the one who betrayed you ..
[Double Trouble chuckles]
Double Trouble: But between you and me, there's no way she's that good of an actor.
[Double Trouble claps their hands together]
Double Trouble: Well, I'll leave you to it! Congrats again. Great work all around.
[Double Trouble leaves]
[Hordak fires his weapon in rage, setting afire everything around him]
[Hordak is brought to tears after hearing of Entrapta's death]
[Scene changes to She-ra, Entrapta, Bow, Micah, and Swift Wind back at Mara's ship]
Entrapta: Hellooo! It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen! How does it work?? What does this button do? I'm going to push it and find out!
[Bow stops Entrapta from pushing a random button]
Bow: Mm. Take us home to Bright Moon.
[The ship powers up]
Micah: Huh? This is actually real? 
[Micah pinches Bow's face]
Bow: Um.. Yes. Remember we did the pinching thing already?
Micah: Well, still, I couldn't let myself believe... Is it all true?
Micah: We're really going home? And this horse really talks?
[Swift wind shouts]
[Scene changes to Double Trouble dangling their feet off the edge of a balcony while they sit in the Fright Zone]
[Double Trouble sends a signal to Glimmer]
Double Trouble: Too easy.. As usual.
[Scene changes to Glimmer and Scorpia back at Bright Moon]
Glimmer: Are you ready?
Scorpia: Not really. 
[Glimmer holds Scorpia's claw and the two teleport away, just as Adora and her group's ship land]
Micah: Bright Moon. I'm really home.
[Micah walks to Adora and Bow]
Micah: Glimmer! Glimmer, where are you?
[They all find Shadow Weaver sitting on Glimmer's throne]
Shadow Weaver: She's gone.
Shadow Weaver: Micah? Is it really you?
[Micah sends a spell at Shadow Weaver, but she stops it]
Micah: What is this traitor doing here? 
Adora: Where's Glimmer?
[Scene changes to Fright Zone, Catra walking into Hordak's sanctum]
Catra: Hordak? You wanted to talk with me? 
[Door closes behind Catra]
Catra: Come on, I don't have time for this. Our troops are moving out for Bright Moon as we speak. If there's something you need, you can-
[Metal clatters] 
[A harmful blast of energy barely misses Catra]
Hordak: Hello, Force Captain.
