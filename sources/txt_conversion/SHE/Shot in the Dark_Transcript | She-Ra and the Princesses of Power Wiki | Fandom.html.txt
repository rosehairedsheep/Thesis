[Space, Darla's Hull]
[Static hums over the communication line as Bow and Glimmer attempt to contact the Princess Alliance; Adora paces while Catra sits nearby and Wrong Hordak looks on; Entrapta stares at Darla's interface]
Adora: [pausing and looking to Bow and Glimmer] Anything yet?
Bow: Adora, I'm trying, but no one's answering. They're...gone.
Entrapta: [Darla's interface beeps] Uh-oh. I think I found the blockade Perfuma was talking about. [everyone looks to the Interface where Horde ships surround Etheria]
Bow: [nervously] That's a lot of Horde ships.
Glimmer: [worried] How are we going to get through that? If I could use magic, I'd teleport us past it. I've never felt such a lack of magical energy in my life. [frustratedly trills] Why does space hate me so much?!
Adora: [determined] Magic or no magic, we're going home.
Catra: [cynically] So, your plan is to, what, ram through an armada of ships?
Adora: [indignantly] No! [slight pause] ...Maybe! We have to try.
Catra: [standing up to confront Adora] You heard Perfuma! They're waiting for us. They're going to catch us. And if they do... [slight pause as her hands shake; tone becomes less confrontational] ...Take it from someone who's defeated you guys, like, a lot. Charging in without a plan won't work. [walks to the front panel]
Adora: Okay, well, [scoffs] you didn't defeat us. [catches up to her and shoulders her with a pout]
Bow: Adora, Catra's right. [slight pause as everyone looks shocked] ...That felt weird to say. We barely made it out last time we tangled with Prime. We need to figure out another way to help our friends. Catra, you were with him. Does he have any kind of, I don't know, weakness?
Catra: What, you think he'd tell me?
Wrong Hordak: [suddenly standing over Catra's shoulder; happily] You are correct, brother. [everyone screams and turns in shock] We do not discuss Horde Prime's weakness.
Adora: [recovering, a slight chuckle] Uh, wh-huh, so that means, Horde Prime does have a weakness. 
Wrong Hordak: [head tilts to the side hesitantly, nervously] No. Horde Prime is all-powerful. [eye twitches as he looks at them all standing unimpressed]
Bow: [unconvinced] You just said-- 
Wrong Hordak: [nervously, sweating] We do not discuss Horde Prime's weakness. We do not discuss Krytis.
Glimmer: What's Krytis?
[Catra has a look of realization and Wrong Hordak's dialogue gets muddled with a deep bass whoosh as she grimaces as she touches the back of her neck]
Wrong Hordak: [tone growing increasingly nervous] Krytis does not exist, and if it did, we would not discuss it.
[Catra gasps and has flashbacks to memories shared with her when she was chipped]
Catra: It's a place. A planet.
[Wrong Hordak whimpers nervously as they all stare at him; Entrapta types, keys clacking at the interface]
Entrapta: [to herself] Krytis, Krytis, Krytis... [the interface dings and flashes red] Hmm. There's something here, but it's locked. We need adminstrator clearance to access it.
Adora: [walks to the interface] Darla, show us.
[The interface beeps to show a star map]
Entrapta: [happily] A-ha! According to Darla's records, it's located here [points at a spot on the map], not too far from us!
Wrong Hordak: [stutters nervously and tone shifts in pitch on different words] In-in-in-incorrect. It is located nowhere, because it does not exist, because Lord Prime destroyed it.
Catra: [walks to the interface; firmly] I know what I saw. Prime's trying to hide something, and it has to do with this planet.
Adora: [walks to sit in captain's chair] There's something on Krytis Prime doesn't want us to know about... and we're gonna find it. [determinedly] Set course for Krytis.
[Opening Theme plays]

New scene
[Krytis, interior cave]
[Wind whistles in the atmosphere as the crew walks out into the rocky cave with their spacesuits; they look on at a toppled, aged Horde spire]
Bow: Prime was definitely here.
Adora: But something made him leave.
[The best friend squad walk down the rocky precipice, with Entrapta and Wong Hordak close behind, Wrong Hordak fearfully gripping a tablet as Entrapta guides him with a hair tendril; Catra steps to the edge of the precipice, looking at the spire; she gasps lightly, and touches her neck; realizing what she's done, she quickly whips her hand back to her side and hisses to herself; noticing her tail has bristled out, she smooths it with a grunt and follows the others down the precipice]
[The best friend squad along with Catra continue through the cave; Entrapta yelps as she touches a wire and gets shocked as Wrong Hordak looks on; the squad climbs through a door to the Spire that is cracked open and stop in a large open area where dust billows around; Entrapta hops down in front of them and croons in awe, then continues down quickly on her hair tendrils as the others follow behind more slowly; metal scrap clatters around as Entrapta digs through it]
Entrapta: This place should have some log of the invasion. [picks up a long metal piece with her tendrils and coos over a panel underneath, tossing the metal piece aside; grabbing and pulling Wrong Hordak with a tendril] Maybe Wrong Hordak can connect to it and tell us what happened here.
[Plops the machine WH was carrying down with one tendril and makes WH kneel with the other, plugging in a cable from the spire behind him to his neck outlet as it whirs to life]
Entrapta: [Looking at tablet] Good news, my readings show that the atmosphere is [takes off helmet and tosses it aside] safe.
[Everyone else takes off their helmets except for Catra; Bow looks at her and chuckles]
Catra: What? She's been wrong before. A lot, actually.
Bow: If my helmet were that adorable, I'd leave it on, too. [gasps] Those ears!
Catra: [blushes, embarrassed, incredulous] It is not! [grunts, struggling to pull her helmet off]
[Everyone chuckles at Catra's struggle; finally she gets it off with a rush of air, and everyone's laughter dies except for Adora's who continues to chuckle a little with happy tears in her eyes as Catra looks on, blushing and smiling; Adora sighs as her laughter dies out and Bow and Glimmer glance at each other]
Entrapta: [everyone drops their helmets as Entrapta jumps up on her tendrils and shrieks excitedly] I'm picking up a heat signature. There's someone alive on this planet, right here, somewhere in this Spire. 
Wrong Hordak: [stuttering, tone growing increasingly nervous] I-i-impossible. Prime destroyed all life here on this planet that does not exist.
Adora: [as the tablet beeps intermittently] Well, he missed someone, and we have to find them.
Entrapta: [throwing earpieces to Glimmer and Adora] Pulling up the Spire's schematics now. We'll guide you through from here. [tosses earpieces to Catra and Bow]
Catra: [lagging behind as the rest of the Best Friend Squad begins to walk ahead] So, wait, the plan is to barge ahead into the structurally unsound building to find some mystery person that we know nothing about, in hopes that they somehow know how to defeat Horde Prime? 
[Voices overlap from the three of them, all nonchalant: 
Adora: That about sums it up.
Bow: Yeah, pretty much.
Glimmer: [giggles] Yep, that's the plan.]
Catra: [mumbling to herself as she trudges to where they're standing] Honestly, what did I expect.
Bow: You know, we were just gonna recklessly blast our way through that blockade until you stopped us. So this whole thing is basically your idea.
Glimmer: [hugs onto Bow's arm to goad Catra] Yeah, it's kind of your mission.
Catra: No, it's not--[yelps as Bow pulls her between him and Glimmer]
Glimmer and Bow: [the spin Catra between their arms, chanting in singsong voices] Catra's first mission, Catra's first mission!
[Catra ducks out from under them and Adora catches her, smirking; Catra blushes]
Catra: [trudges away; frustrated, growling] Ugh, I am going to kill your friends.
Adora: Please don't.

New scene
[Etheria, ransacked Rebel encampment]
[The remnants of the Princess Alliance inspect the wreckage of the encampment; Swift Wind blusters and paws at the ground while Frosta, Perfuma, Netossa and Sea Hawk look around; Sea Hawk lifts a tent and picks up Mermista's Sea-Ra doll, growing visibly worried; Netossa puts a hand on his shoulder; leaves rustle in the nearby bushes and everyone readies for an attack]
Castaspella: [popping up from the brush] I came as soon as I heard--[gets cut off by a cone of ice encasing her body] What--? What do you think you're doing?
[Frosta uses an ice platform to rise up and check Casta's neck for a chip; she gives a thumbs-up to let the others know she's clean and then releases her and runs back]
Casta: I don't understand how this happened. Surely this can't be everyone who's left?
Perfuma: [anxiously] We-- We need to find another place to make camp. They know we're here. They could be back at any time.
Casta: [frustratedly] So, that's it? We're going to hide?
Perfuma: [increasingly anxious] Just until we figure out what to do. Maybe we could go to Mystacor. It has that [takes nervous breath] invisibility spell.
Shadow Weaver: [echoing, offscreen] That's not going to work. [walks into the camp] With Micah controlled by Prime, Mystacor is already compromised.
Casta: [quietly, angrily] How did the Rebellion lose so many of our finest members, and yet we're still stuck with you? [to the rest of them] We're wasting time here. We need to seek out the Horde and get my brother back. I lost him once, I'm not gonna lose him again.
Perfuma: [anxiously] We need to get out of here! We need to make sure the rest of the Rebellion is safe first. [Perfuma walks and the rest outside of Casta and Shadow Weaver follow; Casta looks back at Shadow Weaver and glares]
Shadow Weaver: [puts a hand on a surprised Casta's shoulder] If you want to help Micah, come with me.
Casta: [pushes Shadow Weaver's hand away; angrily] You can't seriously think I would ever go anywhere with you.
Shadow Weaver: You don't have a plan. I do.
[Casta looks back worriedly at the remnants of the alliance as they gather what they could from the wreckage of the camp]
Casta: [looks back and glares, moving closer] Fine. But if you try anything, I won't hesitate to strike you down.
[Shadow Weaver steps closer and body checks Casta, making her gasp and become nervous, then walks away; Casta follows, glancing back]

New scene
[Krytis, Interior of the Spire]
[The Best Friend Squad walks along a hallway; suddenly a figure flashes past in front of Catra and she gasps; she looks back at the other three ahead of her and gasps again at the large blocked doorway in front of them]
Adora: [pressing a hand to the door] That's weird.
Catra: Cool. Maybe this planet chased away Horde Prime with poorly planned architecture.
Entrapta: [over the earpiece] Why'd you stop? Go through the door right in front of you.
Bow: [tapping his earpiece] Entrapta...there's no door.
[scene transition to where Entrapta is looking at her tablet]
Entrapta: Well, the schematics show a door right where you're standing. [the tablet beeps and shows the dots representing the BFS and an open pathway] Data never lies.
Wrong Hordak: [gasps and sits up quickly; in disbelief] The logs say Lord Prime...retreated from this planet? [becoming increasingly more breathless] Oh...this cannot be. Lord Prime...does not retreat. He is...the almighty conqueror. [covers his head] His dominion is just and eternal.
Entrapta: [defiantly] I don't know how many times I have to repeat myself: Data never lies!
[Wrong Hordak snorts as tears begin to run down his face and he starts to sob]
[Scene transition to the BFS in the hall; Wrong Hordak's bawling causes feedback over the comms, making the squad grimace in pain]
Entrapta: [over the earpiece; attempting to be comforting, questioningly] Uh...I mean... there, there?
Catra: [frustrated] Ah, whatever. We need a door? [grunts a few times as she slices a new door for them into the wall with her claws, kicking the cutout piece into the structure; panting] There's your door. You're welcome.
Bow: [as they all look on and Adora blushes while smiling in Catra's direction; cautiously] Uh, we don't know what we're dealing with here. Maybe you shouldn't just smash stuff.
Catra: [gesturing to the door as Glimmer walks through] Do you wanna find whoever is here or not? Let's just get this over with.
[Adora and Bow glance at each other before continuing; Bow stops at the door and Catra smirks and gestures for him to continue; he frowns and raises an eyebrow as he climbs through and Catra follows; the side of the wall that Catra sliced through glows and whirs with magical energy]
[They continue to walk down the hallway, and many spores begin to flow around the space and minerals encase pieces of the metal; Bow stops to inspect a rock with an arrow that changes into a magnifying glass]
Bow: It's some sort of mineral growth. ...It's eating away at the Spire.
Catra: [incredulously] You have an arrow that turns into a magnifying glass? I can't believe we were losing to you guys. [walks ahead as Adora frowns, following behind] 
[Bow puts away the arrow and walks over to Glimmer, who stares out into the open side of the Spire where many mineral stalagmites formed]
Bow: Glimmer? You okay?
Glimmer: [stutters, confused] Uh...I--I don't know. I have a weird feeling about this place. It feels...[crushes a spore that lands in her hand and hugs herself] strange.
Adora: [touching her earpiece] Entrapta, this floor is clear. Where to now? [Feedback occurs as Wrong Hordak continues to bawl over the comm line] Entrapta?
Entrapta: [over the earpiece] Sorry. Seems Wrong Hordak has begun to question the meaning of life.
[The squad grimaces and glances at each other uncomfortably]
Wrong Hordak: [over the earpiece] Who am I if not an exalted brother of Prime?
Entrapta: [over the earpiece] But don't worry! I've got it totally under control!
[Bow frowns deeply as Glimmer grimaces and her eye twitches as WH continues to bawl]
Adora: Okay, any sign of those life readings?
Entrapta: [over the earpiece] I'm picking up something on the next level!
Adora: [sighs as she takes her finger off the earpiece, cutting off WH's bawling] Upstairs. Let's go.
[The squad continues to trek upwards; a spore lands on Catra's nose and she sneezes in a high-pitched way]
Bow: [coos] Aww. That's your sneeze?
Catra: [rubbing her nose] What?
Bow: It's just so...cute! [brings his hands to his chest in admiration]
Catra: [incredulous, embarrassed] It's a normal sneeze! [pushes him away as he chuckles slightly]
[Adora and Glimmer hum and chuckle as Bow continues]
Bow: I can't believe the whole time you were trying to kill us, you had the cutest sneeze of all time!
Catra: [embarrassed] I am not cute! [tail bristles up and out as she stomps and throws her fists down in annoyance] 
Bow: The angrier you get, the cuter you are!
[Bow chuckles and Catra grunts as she lunges for him and misses, landing a hand on a wall; where her hand lands a glow ripples out; she growls in annoyance and her hand slides into the wall; Catra screams in surprise as she notices]
Adora: [yelling and running back] Catra!
Catra: [as Adora and Bow grunt and pull her away from the wall; anxiously, fearfully] Get me out of this thing!
[Her hand comes out of the wall with a sploosh and the three of them land on their behinds, grunting; the wall glows and ripples, and spikes begin to shoot out, making the squad scream and run]
Glimmer: [yelling] Bow! [almost in hysterics] I think this feeling I had about this place is a bad feeling!
[The spikes continues to stab toward them as they run down the hall; Bow lifts Glimmer through an opening with a grunt, and Adora and Catra leap through with grunts of their own; the spikes close off the opening]

New scene
[Etheria, Whispering Woods]
[Shadow Weaver and Castaspella walk through the woods; Casta gets her cape stuck on a tree branch, grunts as she struggles to pull it free, then loses her balance as she yanks it away, but recovers; Casta sighs in relief]
Casta: [turning to notice Shadow Weaver has stopped to look at her; frustrated] Don't look at me like that. You could slow down, you know. [crosses her arms] Where are we going?
Shadow Weaver: [continues walking; impatiently] There's no time, you need to keep up.
Casta: You said you had a plan. The only reason I'm following you is because if anyone would know about mind control, it's you.
Shadow Weaver: [stops walking and chuckles] Mind control? Is that what they told you? [turning to face her] No. My gifts were always far subtler.
Casta: [impatiently] Then you're wasting my time. [begins walking away from Shadow Weaver] I'm going back.
Shadow Weaver: [bluntly] You never held a candle to Micah's power as a sorcerer. Neither did I. [Casta stops, aghast] We both know how dangerous he is now that his magic is controlled by the enemy. We won't be able to stop him. He could do irreparable damage to others, and...to himself.
[Casta looks up in realization, then sighs with resignation]
Casta: [turning back; sourly] So what is your plan?
Shadow Weaver: [quietly, with dark conviction] We make ourselves stronger. [begins walking away]
[Casta, worried, steels herself and runs to catch up to Shadow Weaver]

New scene
[Krytis, inner spire]
Catra: [hopping down from a ledge; nervously, bordering on fear] What was that? Why did that wall try to eat me?!
[Everyone's eyes are wide with disbelief at the sight of the same entrance to the spire they had seen before entering the long hallway]
Adora: [incredulous, nervously] Isn't this where we started?
[Growling echoes distantly, and everyone starts with short cries]
Bow: [nervously] You guys hear that, too, right?
Entrapta: [over the earpiece; uncharacteristically monotone] The energy signature is just ahead of you. Go through the door on your left.
Adora: Door? W-what door?
[They look and suddenly there is a door and pathway on their left that wasn't there previously]
Catra: [tail bristles out and she hugs her forearms; nervously] We're not really going through that...are we?
Adora: [nervously] Well, Entrapta says this is the way, so, [firmly] let's go.
[Adora begins to walk down the path as Glimmer and Bow follow]
Catra: [incredulous] Seriously?! How have you guys stayed alive this long?
[scene transitions to the group having already been walking a ways; the path seems to continually push the end they're walking toward farther away, no matter how far they walk; Adora gasps lightly at this realization, but Entrapta cuts in]
Entrapta: [over the earpiece; regular voice] Adora! Are you there? Wrong Hordak downloaded the rest of the records from Prime's occupation of Krytis, and guess what?! [scene transition to Entrapta excitedly standing behind Wrong Hordak as he whimpers and sniffles with his knees pulled to his chest] This planet was once a First Ones colony like Etheria. It looks like Horde Prime and the First Ones were fighting for control of this planet, and Horde Prime won. [contemplating] But something on the planet drove him away before he could conquer it. He tried to erase all records of his failure.
Wrong Hordak: [quietly, in shock and realization] Horde Prime lied to us. [frustratedly pouting]  He...is not all-powerful.
[scene transition back to the squad]
Adora: [to the rest of the squad] See?! We're on the right path!
Bow: But we have to get out of here first. And that door still isn't getting any closer.
Entrapta: [over the earpiece] Sorry, what door?
Catra: [angrily, but not aggressively] What do you mean, what door? The one you told us to go through.
Entrapta: [over the earpiece] That wasn't me. This is the first time we've talked since the last floor.
[Dreadful shock dawns on Catra's face as the group looks back down the path to see the door at the end stretching further and further away]
Catra: [angrily, nervously, with fearful tears in her eyes] I knew it! I knew this was a terrible plan! This place is weird, and unnatural, and we need to get out of here before--!
Entrapta: [over the earpiece, happily] By the way, who's your new friend?
Glimmer: [touching the earpiece, making it chirp] What are you talking about? It's just the four of us.
[scene transition to Entrapta looking at her tablet as it beeps, showing dots representing five presences]
Entrapta: Hate to disagree, but there's a definite heat signature, right behind you.
[scene transition to the squad turning slowly around with dread; a humanoid figure with a blue mane surrounding its head from its shoulders stands silently behind them, its head cocked to one side; it moves slightly, having noticed its' been found out, making Glimmer, Bow, and Adora scream; Catra pushes Glimmer and Bow apart and screams as she tackles the creature, teleporting away with it]
[In a different area of that floor, most likely the same one with the spores as before, Catra and the creature reappear, Catra screaming as the momentum causes them to land with her pushing the creature down and her flipping forward and landing with a grunt]
Adora: [over the earpiece; half-yelling, worried] Catra! Catra!
Catra: [touching the earpiece, making it beep; anxiously, half-yelling in fear] Adora! I'm down here!
[Catra looks up and gasps lightly in fear as the creature looms over her; it suddenly shape shifts with a blue light into a large feline-looking quadruped, slamming a foot down and roaring angrily]
Adora: [over the earpiece] I'm coming!
Catra: [fearfully] Hurry.
[scene transition to Adora gaining a look of determination on her face, panting and running faster than she was previously; spores begin to float past, and suddenly spikes shoot out from the walls just as before, making Adora stop and gasp as they almost pierce her neck; Bow yelps as he and Glimmer are also imprisoned by the spikes, while Glimmer breathes out heavily; they all pant as they try not to move in their precariously held postions to not touch the spikes]
Bow: [straining, struggling to not move; through grit teeth] Adora, what do we do?
Adora: I don't know, just--just nobody move!
[Glimmer looks around at the spikes in uncertain contemplation, then reaches a hand out; the spikes react and move closer to her hand, branching out to form smaller spikes]
Bow: [anxiously] Glimmer! What are you doing? [Bow nervously looks back at his own spikes as they inch closer to his face]
Glimmer: [firmly] Hang on, I have to try something.
[Glimmer pokes at a spike and it evaporates into spores of magical energy]
Glimmer: Illusions. These are all illusions. [gasps lightly; excitedly] Then that means--
[Glimmer's hand absorbs the spikes around her to create a magic rune, which emboldens and shoots out a wave that disintegrates the rest of the spikes]
Glimmer: [laughing; elated] I knew I was feeling something about this place. I thought it was bad, but it's--it's not! It's magic.
[Glimmer smiles at them and they return it until a roar echoes distantly]
Adora: [urgently, turning] Catra!
[Scene transition to the creature angrily circling Catra, growling; it turns invisible and Catra gasps lightly, anxiously; she looks around with wide eyes until the creature reappears nose-to-nose with her, growling; Catra shakes in fear and whimpers until she revs up and sneezes; the creature rears back with a murmur and begins to glow, making Catra shield herself with a yelp; Catra looks over her arm to see the creature shapeshift into a calmer and smaller version of a feline, sitting politely; it mimics Catra's sneeze perfectly, shaking its mane and purring after; Catra looks at it bewildered, before Glimmer, Bow, and Adora fall out of a magic portal screaming into the room, landing with a thud in a heap, stirring up dust]
Adora: [rubbing her head along with Glimmer and Bow rubbing various body parts to ease the pain; yelling, concerned] Catra! Hold--on? [last syllable becomes quieter and bewildered as she spots Catra petting the creature]
[A distance away, Catra pats the creature as it purrs]
Adora: [as they all walk up closer; puzzled] Are you--are you petting the thing that's been trying to kill us?
Catra: [frustrated, through grit teeth] I'm trying something here, if you didn't notice...
Bow: [as Adora covers her mouth to chuckle; in awe] It's just so...cute!
Catra: [yelling] It's not cute!
[The creature turns red and growls at the squad, mane and tale bristling, making Catra yelp and lean way while Glimmer and Bow step back]
Adora: [moving closer, angrily] Get away from her!
Catra: [moving to block Adora's path with both arms extended] No...! Don't. [pauses and attempts to quietly reign in frustration] I'm sorry. I got angry. It's something I'm working on. 
Adora: [getting teary eyed in awe] Aww, you are?
Catra: [angrily] Yes! Now can you please-- [closes eyes and brings her hands together to calm herself, taking a deep breath; quieter and calmer tone of voice] Yes, I am. I think this thing responds to emotions. So can you not give me a hard time right now?
Adora: No, sorry, sorry. Do your thing.
[Catra walks away with hands out toward the creature, making it back away and growl]
Catra: [squatting down; calmly] It's okay. We won't hurt you.
[The creature growls one last time, then shifts back into the calm feline exterior; it moves toward Catra's outstretched hand and sniffs, finally pressing its head into it; a glow emits from both Catra and the creature, making everyone look around; Catra sneezes and wipes her nose, and the creature tilts its head slightly and mimics the sneeze; it suddenly shifts back into growling at Adora who squats next to Catra]
Adora: You're--you're magic aren't you.
[The creature shifts to be smaller and hides behind Catra's other side, hissing at Adora]
Adora: [happily, assuring] Me, too. [she emits a glow from eyes]
[The creature's eyes widen and it goes to sniff Adora's hand, then it shifts back into the calmer and larger version of itself; it presses its face against Adora's happily, making spores spark out around them as Adora chuckles; the creature turns to Catra and mewls to her]
Catra: [crawling backward away; nervously] Uh, what's it doing?! [the creature continues to mewl] Uh, guys? [breathily, nervously] Can you hear it talking, too? Please tell me you can hear it talking.
[Everyone shakes their head negatively and Catra turns back nervously]
Bow: It must have imprinted on you. It...trusts you.
Catra: [shakily] Well, it shouldn't. Why is everything with you guys so weird?
[The creature continues to mewl]
Catra: [haltingly as she interprets for the rest of them] It says its name is...Melog. It's been here by itself for a long time. It thought we were enemies, like, um, the ones that came to take its magic? They dug into the ground, built machines.
Adora: [with realization] The First Ones. That's what they were doing. They were mining this planet's magic, just like on Etheria.
Catra: [interpreting] But they took too much. And then..."the one who destroys" came.
[Melog shapeshifts into the similar figure of Horde Prime; Catra gasps lightly]
Catra: [interpreting] He tried to conquer this place, but-but couldn't. [Catra closes her eyes and hugs herself tightly] The magic of Krytis was too wild for Prime. He didn't understand what it was. He couldn't use it, couldn't defend against it...
Glimmer: [gasps, excitedly] Magic is Horde Prime's weakness!
Catra: [interpreting as Melog shifts back into it's feline form] Melog drove Prime off but couldn't defeat him. And now...it's the last of its kind.
Adora: [kneeling next to Catra; to Melog] I'm sorry for what happened to you, but we're gonna make sure it never happens again. Our planet has magic, too. It might be the last place in the universe that does. If you wanna come with us, I think you'd really like it there.
[Melog's ears perk up and it purrs, licking Adora and she chuckles]
Adora: [touching the earpiece and making it chirp] Entrapta? We're on our way back down. And we're bringing a friend. [reaches up to pat Melog]
Entrapta: [over the earpiece] That's great! [scene transition to Entrapta and Wrong Hordak] And I'm happy to report that Wrong Hordak's existential crisis has resolved.
Wrong Hordak: Brothers! Horde Prime lied to us. He is a false ruler. We must rise up against him, [scene transitions back to Adora listening on the earpiece] and free the universe from his unjust reign!
Adora: [patting Melog; confidently] That's the plan!
Bow: [moving with Glimmer to stand near them] Uh, Adora? We still don't know how we're gonna get back to Etheria.
Catra: [humming with a smirk] Hmm, about that. I think I might have an idea.

New scene
[Etheria, Whispering Woods]
[Castaspella's robe gets caught on a stalagmite gem; she grunts and rips it free]
Casta: [angrily] I can't believe I fell for this. You don't care about Micah. All you've ever cared about is getting more power for yourself. Well, I'm putting a stop to this right now!
[Casta gasps in surprise as a warthog-like creature snores softly next to her; she then looks around to see many more, sleeping soundly with moss and tree roots covering them]
Shadow Weaver: [softly, reverently] Everything we were taught in the Sorcerer's Guild was wrong. The First Ones didn't enhance this planet's magic with their tech, they weakened it. Etheria isn't a weapon. It's a living creature. [Casta touches a warthog's side and it emits magical energy spores] And its magic has been here the whole time, slumbering, waiting to be awakened. [moving to be behind Casta] Prime has taken our strongest fighters, [captures a few spores in her hand and half-closes it] but he does not yet know what this planet really is. We can destroy the restraints the First Ones built, set the magic of Etheria free...[closes her hand completely on the spores] and use it against him.
Castaspella: [scoffs and moves away, crossing her arms] You just want to take the magic for yourself.
Shadow Weaver: I want to save Micah. I owe him that much, at least. Come with me. Help me undo what the First Ones did, and... [holds out her hand to Casta] stop me if I try to take the power for myself.
Casta: [face growing resolute, taking Shadow Weaver's hand] You better believe I will.

[Space, Darla's bridge]
[Everyone stands looking at the blockade of Horde ships surrounding Etheria]
Entrapta: [looking at Darla's interface's projection of the blockade] Coming up on the blockade around Etheria. [nervously] They'll have visual on us soon.
Bow: [uncertainly] We sure this is gonna work?
Adora: Only one way to find out.
Catra: [turning to Melog] Ready?
[Melog grunts in response and then focuses, beginning to glow; it disappears, making spores drift around inside the bridge; Melog channels all its magical energy into the ship, masking its presence from the Horde ships; everyone else gathers with wide, concerned eyes to watch their approach]
Glimmer: [sighs shakily, then turns to Catra] So, just to make sure I get it, we're going to go running through a Horde blockade while relying on the magic of a creature we just met?
Catra: [turning to her, happily] That about sums it up, yes.
[Glimmer and Bow are aghast, then smile in recognition of Catra's plan's similarity to many of their own]
Entrapta: [yelling] Punch it, Darla! [slams fist down on the interface panel, making it glow and whir]
[Darla charges up and boosts toward the Horde ships, engine whirring; Everyone gathers together, and they all except Entrapta and Wrong Hordak start screaming; the ship propels itself faster toward the planet, and Catra shuts her eyes with a strained grunt; the ship reappears in Etheria's atmosphere and stops boosting itself; Catra opens her eyes one at a time and gasps lightly at the view of stars in Etheria's sky; she then looks down to see her hand grasping Adora's, which she grunts at and promptly throws it away, grabbing her arm with a slight blush]
Adora: [walking forward in disbelief] It worked... It worked! Ah! [excitedly breathes and jumps up] Melog did it!
[Everyone except Catra and Wrong Hordak begin cheering and laughing; Melog runs up to Catra and mewls happily, at which Catra smiles; suddenly, Glimmer runs up and kisses Catra's cheek, at which Catra growls in frustration]
Glimmer: [still grasping Catra's shoulders as she looks away with a blush of embarrassment; happily trilling] Catra saved the daaay!
Bow: Aw, come here!
[Bow begins to hug Catra, along with Glimmer; Catra begins to refute this while he talks]
Bow: [happily trilling as Entrapta snickers] Best Friend Squad huuug!
Catra: No, no, absolutely not!
[Adora looks on with a smile; Darla's cargo bay door opens with a whir to overlook the dawn of a new day on Etheria to the Best Friend Squad and Melog, with birds chirping happily]
Adora: We made it. We're home.
