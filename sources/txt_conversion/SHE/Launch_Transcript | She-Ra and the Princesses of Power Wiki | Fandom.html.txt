[High-pitched humming, small green lights flicker on down the spire. A group of what looks like sea elves are gathered, watching it, then switches to a view from the Whispering Woods. A holographic Horde Prime forms]
Horde Prime: Rejoice, Etheria, for Prime has come to you. [Etherians watch below] Do not fear, for you have been given the opportunity to share in a world soon to be remade in my image. [The people of Elberon gather to watch as the scene switches to Seaworthy] But first, you must prove yourselves worthy. Your leader, your...She-Ra, she would see you suffer in darkness for her sake. [In a bar, two reptile-like creatures look at each other questioningly] Cast aside this false hero and deliver her to me. [Repeatedly, distorted] Prime sees all. Prime knows all. They will not escape my judgement. 
[The princesses, Perfuma, Scorpia, Mermista and Frosta stand in a line on a cliff watching]
[Entrapta barges in between Scorpia and Mermista]
Entrapta: Wow...this is amazing!
[Scorpia lowers her grey signaler and the others look and her in obvious annoyance]
Entrapta: Mm, and...bad. Very bad. 
[Opening theme]
[Scene transition to Adora laying on the floor in her tent. Bow comes in with a tray]
Bow: Hey, sleepyhead, you hungry? [screams and drops tray] What happened? Are you okay? 
Adora: I gotta go...save Glimmer. [groans and drops back onto floor] My body is betraying me.
Bow: No, you’re exhausted. That happens to regular people when they keep throwing themselves into battle and refusing to sleep.
Adora: [still on the floor, head turns to Bow] I hate it.
Bow: Come on, you just need to rest. [He helps Adora back onto her bed] 
[Adora sighs; her head hits the pillow and her eyes start closing slowly]
Bow: Now, close your eyes and-
Frosta: IS SHE DEAD? [alarmed]
Bow: What? No! 
Frosta: [slightly agitated] Ok, good, ‘cause Adora normally does the planning and we were wondering if there was a plan--
Bow: [quietly, almost whispering] Listen, the upgrades to Mara’s ship are done, but we can’t go anywhere until Adora’s back on her feet. [He turns to Adora, normal talking voice] Now, close your eyes and everyone will--
Swift Wind: [rips open triangle in Adora’s tent to stick his head in] Did someone say Swift--[Bow clasps his hands over Swift Wind’s mouth; sound muffled] Wind?
Micah [opens tent flap]: Is Adora feeling better? Did you tell her Horde Prime’s message? [Bow sweats as Micah comes close to his face] Does she know he’s looking for her? 
Adora [bolts upright]: Whazzat?
Bow [angrily, annoyed]: Okay, that’s enough. Adora, rest! Swift Wind, head! [Swift Wind shoves down Adora’s head to the pillow; Adora grunts] Everybody, shh! [Bow emphasises and bows his head while putting a finger over his mouth] 
Frosta: She will be fine soon, right?
Bow: Yes. She just needs sleep. [Emphasising by end; all but Bow exit the tent. Cut to Adora snoring softly on the bed]
[Bow smiles and Entrapta comes in; Bow’s expression turns annoyed]
Entrapta: Adora sick log, day three! [enthusiastically, holding a recorder] 
Bow: [pushes Entrapta out the tent] Nope! [Entrapta wails]
Entrapta: [lifts her mask] Wait! But it’s for science!
[Entrapta turns around, the princesses (Mermista, Perfuma, Scorpia, Frosta) are gathered around a campfire, sitting on logs]
Mermista: Look, we have to do something. We don’t know when Adora is gonna get better and even when she does we have no plan on how to get Glimmer back! [slight groan] We know she’s on Horde Prime’s ship, but we don’t know where that is, in like, space. [Scorpia seems sorrowful, Frosta crosses her arms, sad] 
Perfuma: Well, then it’s up to us to make a plan to find Glimmer! With these! [She smiles pleasantly and holds up tiny Adora and Bow]
Frosta [standing]: We don’t need dolls. We just need THESE! [She summons her ice fists]
Mermista: What... are you gonna do with those? [smirking at end]
[Close-up on Frosta; she holds her ice fists up to her face and they glisten]
Frosta: Punch...Horde Prime. 
[Mermista smirks as Perfuma sweats and clears her throat] 
Perfuma: Perhaps...if we meditate we can access our princess connection to Glimmer out in space! [Mermista looks skeptical, then surprised when Entrapta comes in]
Entrapta: Hello. Oh, hi. Were you guys talking about space? [she dons her Beast Island mask. Mermista, Frosta turn their heads the opposite way and crosses their arms; Emily whirs around to the opposite way as Perfuma looks around nervously]
Perfuma: Yes. We were talking about how to get Glimmer back from spa--
Entrapta [suddenly appears at Perfuma’s side, surprising her]: I’d do anything to go to space! [Entrapta gets starry-eyed] An entire universe of information at our fingertips, full of countless stars and civilizations…. [space backgrounds appear and change with every few words. Dramatic music plays and stops when Mermista claps one hand on Entrapta’s mouth, interrupting her daydream; Entrapta makes a muffled grunt]
Mermista: This isn’t like a fun field trip for you to run more of your messed-up experiments. Our friend’s out there. Remember?
[Entrapta smiles innocently]
Mermista: Glimmer? [Entrapta smiles and blinks innocently; Mermista groans and puts her hands to her head] The sparkly one?
Frosta: You’ve met her multiple times! [She stands up gestures with her hand as she speaks] 
Entrapta: Oh, right! [Scorpia puts her pincer to her mouth and whimpers]
Scorpia: Wow….hey, Entrapta! Look over there! Is that a robot? [She points off-screen as Mermista ducks] 
Entrapta: A robot? Where? [Entrapta runs off and crashes off-screen]
Scorpia: Look, I know she can be all, ‘Whoa, science!’ [She imitates an explosion and laughs maniacally; then turns to the other princesses] But I promise, Entrapta has a good heart. 
Mermista [unconvinced]: She’s betrayed us before. For all we know, as soon as she sees Horde Prime’s ship up close, she’ll ditch us to join his army! [Emphasising by end]
Perfuma: She did use her inventions to...attack us a lot. [sweats nervously while putting one finger up in the air] 
Scorpia: I’m just saying, none of us know how to track a spaceship, but Entrapta might. If you just give her a chance. 
[Perfuma and Frosta look at each other reluctantly]
[Background clattering and groaning as Entrapta climbs to the top of a tent]
Entrapta: Aah! [Scorpia looks pleadingly at Mermista, then getting starry-eyed]
Mermista: [groans] Fine.
[Scorpia, Mermista, Perfuma and Frosta stand in front of the tent]
Mermista: Okay, Geek Princess, are you gonna help us or not?
[Entrapta smiles and blinks innocently once again, Mermista groans and puts her fingers to her temples]
Mermista: If you help us find Glimmer, you can go to space. [Entrapta suddenly appears next to Mermista; Mermista’s expression turns to surprise]
Entrapta: GREAT!
[Scene transition to The Velvet Glove, the hallway in front of Glimmer’s cell]
[Cut to Glimmer pacing inside her cell, then the door zings without opening]
Glimmer: Hello? Who’s there? [Glimmer waits for a response, then looks around frustratedly; she grunts and hits her fist against the door. Camera pans to Catra, in front of the door.] Hey! I know you’re watching me! [Glimmer sighs as Catra touches the door again, obscuring Glimmer’s face with green. Catra turns around, to bump into a clone and gasps]
Clone: You should not be here. 
Catra: I-- I wasn’t- 
Clone: Prime has decreed that none shall speak to the queen. [his expression turns angry] You have disobeyed. 
Catra: Why does it matter? Prime has more important things to worry about. It’s not like I--
Clone: You unworthy wretch! It is not for you to decide what matters to Prime. [Catra looks around nervously] You are a parasite, nothing more than the dirt beneath his-- [During this, Glimmer listens to the conversation with her ear against the door; the clone chokes and bends back, his neck cracking. Catra looks scared as white pupils slide into his eyes] 
Horde Prime/Clone: Little sister, why do you rebel against my commands? [he shrugs slightly, innocent-like. Glimmer jerks away from the door after hearing his voice] 
Catra: Lord Prime?
Horde Prime/Clone: Prime sees all, little sister. [He kneels and puts his hands on his knees; He puts a finger on Catra’s nose] Do not disturb the queen. Now, run along. [He stands back up, and the clone narrows his ‘eyebrows’ at Catra] 
[The clone shoves Catra aside, and opens the door. Glimmer steps back, reluctantly. The clone grabs her by the shoulders and marches Glimmer out. As she walks, she looks back and after a few seconds, Catra returns her stare.]
[Scene transition to Adora twisting and turning in bed. Flashes of a cluster of planets, the Fright Zone, the deepest part of the Whispering Woods, the Velvet Glove, and then Horde Prime, his eyes glowing until the whole screen is covered with green light. Adora wakes up, frightened. Light is streaming through her tent flap. Adora gasps and sits up; she wipes her eyes with her hand, squints and turns to look.] 
Adora: What? [She reaches instinctively for her sword, only to remember she broke it. She sadly holds up part of the hilt, takes a deep breath and looks bravely at the light. Bow is seen snoring on a bean bag, Adora walks past him and out the tent. Adora covers her eyes as she goes out and squints as a She-Ra like figure in golden light stands in front of her.] 
Adora: [surprised] You again. [The figure turns around and starts walking]
Adora: Wa-- wait!
[Scene transition to the princesses on the outskirts of the Woods, Scorpia and Frosta holding leaves over themselves, Entrapta in front of them] 
Entrapta: The message from Horde Prime was transmitted through that spire. [On ‘that’, she points with her hair] Which means it’s got a wavelength, connecting it to his main base of operation, one that we can track. 
Mermista: [smiles sarcastically] Great! [Expression turns dull, slightly agitated] So track it. [Entrapta turns around to face the others] 
Entrapta: Well, hypothetically we can track it. Horde Prime’s astral network is incredibly complex and I’ve only been able to intercept parts. [she gestures while she speaks] I need to gain as much proximity as possible to the receptor before I can triangulate their origin. 
[The other princesses look at each other, confused.]
Scorpia, Mermista, Perfuma, Frosta: Mm, mm…. Hm. 
Entrapta [slowly]: I need to get close to the spire [using her hands, she estimates the size of the spire] to track the signal. [The other princesses smile and nod] 
Princesses: Ohhhh!
Mermista: Got it, got it. 
Entrapta: If we follow that signal, we’ll find a ship of impossibly sophisticated design, [she flips around, upside-down using her hair] the center of a super technologically advanced empire-- [music plays and stops with Perfuma’s line] 
Perfuma: I think we’re mostly hoping to find our kidnapped friend. 
[Mermista walks forward, the others follow]
Mermista: That spire is crawling with surveillance bots. [Cut to drones swarming and flying around in front of spire] We need to find a way to sneak past them so we can get Geek Princess close enough to track the signal. [She turns to the others for this line] 
Scorpia: So, what’s the plan?
Mermista: [deadpan] Uh… that’s the whole plan. We sneak past the drones. [groans] I don’t know, Adora usually handles the being-in-charge stuff.
Perfuma: So we sneak past the bots [mimics tip-toeing], and then if any of them see us we-- 
Frosta: [raises her ice fists in the air] PUNCH THE BOTS!
Mermista: Sure, sounds like enough of a plan for me. And someone needs to keep and eye on-- [she turns around; Entrapta happily humming] Wha-? Did she seriously just immediately run off? [groans and starts running; Perufma, Scorpia, and Frosta follow]
[Cut to clone opening laser door with Glimmer. The clone pushes Glimmer inside, she gasps]
Horde Prime: Your Majesty. Thank you for joining me. I thought you might enjoy a diversion. [camera follows Glimmer; room full of artifacts is revealed, with a sphere-like glass sphere at the end with a spotlight shining on it] Do you like them? [Horde Prime keeps a hand on her shoulder as they walk] Tokens from many worlds. Worlds that I brought into my eternal light. 
Glimmer: Worlds you destroyed. 
Horde Prime: I take no joy in destruction, [he grasps an alien flower from underneath and gently touches the petals] but the weeds must be burned away so that new life may flourish. [He directs Glimmer to the end of the room] This is my favourite. A treasure from the first world I conquered. It was highly prized by it’s people. [He grasps the sphere, the spotlight turns off and he hands the sphere to Glimmer.] And now, it is all that is left of them. [Glimmer squints slightly and holds the sphere gingerly]
Horde Prime: [kneels on floor] You know I am searching for She-Ra. You seem reluctant to help me. But I only wish to use your weapon to bring peace to the darkest corners of the universe.
Glimmer: Peace? If you activate the Heart of Etheria, there will be no one left.
Horde Prime: Yes. No war, no pain. Old worlds swept aside, a new beginning for the universe. [eyes widen as he speaks] I know you understand. All I want to do is what you’ve already done. 
Glimmer: No. No, that wasn’t-- 
[Screen behind them turns on, Bow is seen pushing aside a bot and Micah readying to cast a spell - video stops] 
[Glimmer gasps] 
Glimmer: What--? How--? How?
Horde Prime: Do you recognize him? 
[Close-up on the screen, on Micah, then on Glimmer]
Glimmer: Dad? [Eyes brimming with tears]
Horde Prime: Let me be clear, Your Majesty. [Tears start streaming down Glimmer’s face] Your world belongs to me. But I am still merciful. Would you be reunited with your father in my good graces? Would you deliver me She-Ra? 
Glimmer: I-- I wanted to use the Heart of Etheria. I thought I could save the world, but all I did was bring you here! [She smashes the sphere, and glass shatters] I will never help you. And you will never win. 
Horde Prime: Those who cling to the darkness have made their choice. [Two clones come out and grab Glimmer but the shoulders; Glimmer gasps and walks away sadly. Before leaving, Glimmer glances once more at the screen, from her father’s face down to Horde Prime’s. He snaps his finger and after a moment of darkness, cut to a drone scanning the rocks. The drone whirs as music plays. The princesses are seen hiding behind a large sharp rock, Mermista signals to them and retro-dramatic music plays. Scorpia, Frosta and Mermista run out, and Perfuma grunts and pulls Entrapta with a plant tendril around her waist. A drone scans a rock spire while the princesses run behind it. They look out from a rock, and press their backs against it. The drone finishes scanning, they look at Entrapta]
Entrapta: Well, no signal here. We need to get closer. 
Mermista: [groans] I hate the desert. 
[Camera follows Mermista around to the other side of the rock, she spies ahead]
Mermista: All clear, let’s go. [She jumps down and starts running, the others follow. Perfuma yanks Entrapta ahead with a grunt. All run forward, Entrapta stops in her tracks] 
Entrapta: Wait. I think I’m getting something. [starts tapping on trackerpad with her hair; bleeping noises] 
Perfuma [looks at the others running, then turning around, nervously]: Entrapta, we really need to get out of the open.
Entrapta: Hang on, I’ve almost got it. [Entrapta starts climbing a rock spire with the trackerpad] I need to get up higher. So close, almost got it. [Trackerpad buzzes] Nope. False alarm. We need to get closer. [Perfuma looks next to the spire as a drone whirs closer. She pulls her ‘leash’ on Entrapta and Entrapta grunts and falls]
Entrapta: Aah! [Perfuma hugs Entrapta and covers her mouth as they hide, the drone’s radar sweeps over them and a triangle-shaped green light bleeps]
Perfuma: [whisper-shouting] What do we do? [Across from them, Mermista makes walking, then running motions and waves her arms around]
Perfuma: I should run? [Mermista stops her running gestures and starts running on the spot] Don’t run? Do run? [Memrista waves her arms around as Perfuma breathes heavily] What?
Memrista [covering one side of mouth, whisper-shouting]: Entrapta. 
[Perfuma looks to the side of her, to see the rope broken. She gasps and starts looking around, then sees Entrapta walking into a drone’s radar. They all panic as Scorpia discharges a lightning bolt at the top of a spire, causing it to fall off. Mermista ducks and all sigh in relief as the drone then scans it, diverting its attention. Scorpia screams as Entrapta bumps into a bot, and it starts scanning her]
Entrapta: Oh, hello. You’re...very technologically advanced. [It finishes scanning, and a laser charger whirs. Entrapta screams and hides behind her trackerpad, but to no avail] Bad robot! [Suddenly, a wave of ice covers it and Frosta drags Entrapta away. The bot’s triangle ‘eye’ bleeps and small red lights flicker on the spire. The princesses hide behind a rock spire]
Scorpia: What do we do? [All look towards Mermista]
Mermista: [groans] I don’t know. This plan was obviously doomed from the start. I’m not Adora. Why did I think I could be the leader? [tears brim at her eyes, as she looks at her hands. Entrapta’s signaler flies in front of her face]
Entrapta: Well, still nothing. This transmission pattern is fascinating. We should get closer. 
Mermista: We can’t. [knocks Entrapta’s signaler out of the way] Thanks to you, this place is about to be swarming with bots. We have to retreat. [groans] I should’ve known better than to trust you. You don’t care about Glimmer or any of us, you only care about tech!
Entrapta: Are you all...mad at me?
Mermista: You’re seriously just realizing that? Yeah, we’re mad!
Perfuma: You don’t consider how your actions affect other people! Even people who are supposed to be your friends. 
Frosta: Like us. The ones getting beat up by your dumb bots. [Entrapta winces] And whose kingdoms you almost destroyed. [her eyes brim with tears]
Entrapta: I’m not good at people. But I am good at tech. I thought maybe if I could use tech to help you, you’d like me. [she turns her trackerpad face down] But I messed that up, too. [The princesses are shocked, Entrapta climbs up and starts running]
Mermista: Entrapta, no! [she grunts and runs after her, panting. She grabs onto the end of Entrapta’s hair, Entrapta screams] I said we have to leave! Can you listen for once in your life?
Entrapta: I’m sorry I’m bad at listening! I’m sorry I mess everything up! But you need this signal, and I’m gonna get it for you. 
Mermista [surprised]: You’re still trying to get the signal?
Entrapta [tears in her eyes] Of course. Glimmer needs us. [Mermista looks upwards to see drones flying above them, and Entrapta follows her stare. They both look downwards as heavy footsteps approach, the bots]
Mermista: Okay, Geek Princess. Get that signal. We’ll cover you. [she smiles to a panting Scorpia, Frosta and Perfuma. Entrapta smiles and runs off. Mermista turns to the group] Frosta, Scorpia, on Entrapta! Pefuma, witn me, now! [All run in their respective directions. A drone whirs towards Entrapta, and Scorpia and Frosta smile at each other. Scorpia picks up Frosta with one arm, and launches her. She yells and ice downs the drones, with smoke emitting and then falling on either side of Entrapta. Frosta grunts and lands, looking at Scorpia. The camera pans to Entrapta running onto a platform, launching herself on with her hair. She stares at the spire]
Entrapta: Oh...What’s inside you? [Her hair slaps her cheek] Focus, Entrapta. Glimmer needs you.
[she starts beeping on her trackerpad. Behind her, Mermista jabs the arm of a robot multiple times, grunting. She jumps back next to Perfuma. A laser shoots between them; Mermista and Perfuma both jump out of the way. Mermista lands, and looks at Perfuma briefly before engaging in a battle using her trident with the bot; the bot’s arm gets stuck between two points of her trident and she brings it down; she smiles momentarily before the bot points a laser at her. Struggling to lift her trident, Perfuma lifts the laser arm and plant tendrils curl around it as Mermista hits the head, panting. A spire door opens with more bots]
Mermista: Perfuma, cut off that spire! [Perfuma grunts as a wall of vegetation covers the door.] Nice job.
Perfuma: Thanks. I wish there was water here for you, though. [A drone alarms Mermista, and she turns around to see some pipes.]
Mermista: But there is. If there’s one thing I know in the Fright Zone, it’s the sewer system.  [dropping her trident, she stretches her arms out and the pipes come out of the ground. The pipes come out, gray-ish water floating. She shouts with effort and smiles confidently. Cut to drones following Frosta and Scorpia, Scorpia hugs Frosta and barrels to the side, a huge stream of gray water drowns all the drones as Frosta’s expression turns to surprise and Scorpia’s into disgust. Mermista steps and crosses her arms, smirking as Perfuma follows her with a hopeful smile]
Scorpia: Oh, wow, that smell-- [Scorpia gags]
Frosta [excitedly]: That was so gross! [All run towards Entrapta]
Entrapta: Almost. Got it! Ok, good news and bad news. [The princesses watch, waiting] The good news, I’ve successfully triangulated Horde Prime’s flagship.
Scorpia: Hooray! [raises one pincer in the air happily]
Entrapta: Bad news, I intercepted the last message he sent. He’s sending reinforcement ships to Etheria. They’ll be here any minute. 
Scorpia: I take back my hooray.
[Cut to Adora in the Whispering Woods, running towards the golden figure and breathing heavily. The figure looks at her and releases golden light, whooshing and landing Adora in a large landscape filled with grass, and multiple crystal-rock spires. A portal separates her and the She-Ra-like figure]
Adora: Who are you? Are you She-Ra? [Adora waits for a response, and drops to her knees] She-Ra’s gonne. The sword is broken. So, what do I do now? [After a pause and no response, Adora continues] I’m not sorry I did it. I just didn’t know how much I’d miss her. Not just her strength, but I-- I guess I liked knowing that I had a destiny. It wasn’t my destiny to be She-Ra, was it? It was random. [She looks at the hilt of the sword and the cracked runestone] Light Hope brought me through the portal because she needed to use the weapon. That’s the only reason I’m here. [She stands back up] I don’t know what my destiny is anymore. But I know my friends need my help. I guess I’ll just figure it out from there. [The middle of the portal starts glowing white] Thanks for everything. [A bright white light covers her face as Adora wakes up and gasps, picking up the hilt of the sword. She looks at it solemnly and puts it down, facing the tent flap]
Bow [shoving open the flap]: Adora!
Adora: Bow, wow, you were right. I just needed some sleep. I feel great! [she kneels and pants]
Bow: Good. Because I’m on a call with Mermista and she’s saying--
Mermista [over call on trackerpad]: Get to the ship!
Entrapta: We found her! We found Glimmer! 
Mermista: But also, we found out that Horde Prime is sending more ships to Etheria today. If you don’t leave now, you can’t leave, period. So, uh...RUN! [Bow and Adora watch in surprise and on the last word, they turn to face each other. The princesses, Adora, Bow, Swift Wind and Micah are running towards Mara’s ship]
Micah: We’re exposed here. We need to make these goodbyes quick. [Adora turns and her eyes widen. The princesses look at her in concern, Mermista lifts her head slightly]
Adora [Adora hugs Mermista, much to her surprise]: We’ll be back as soon as we can. [Adora walks back] The Rebellion is in good hands.
Mermista [blushing]: Yeah, turns out I’m an awesome leader, so we’re gonna be fine. [Mermista hugs Entrapta with one arm, around her neck] And Entrapta helped. You’re still a weirdo, but you did good today. We’ve got your back anytime. [Entrapta looks at the other princesses and they all nod in agreement, Entrapta blushes and starts brimming at the eye with tears, Adora smiles and Bow is trying hard not to cry, and he starts sobbing and pulls all of them into a hug. Swift Wind bits the back of Adora’s collar and pulls her away]
Swift Wind: Adora, I-- I’m not going to-- Oh! I don’t know how to say this. 
Adora: You’re staying here. 
Swift Wind: I don’t belong on a ship. I belong on Etheria, protecting it. And with you gone, someone’s gotta bring the glorious flowing hair. [he laughs then sobs] I hope you’re not disappointed in me. 
Adora: Are you kidding? I’m proud. You’re exactly where you need to be. I’m not She-Ra anymore.
Swift Wind: But I’ll always be your loyal steed. [Both smile as drones whir above]
Frosta: Surveillance bots. If they see the ship, they’ll alert the armada and stop us. 
Scorpia: What’re we gonna do? Are we gonna stay here? [Mermista looks back at Adora]
Micah: No. We’re getting this ship off Etheria, no matter what. I’ve got an idea. [Cut to Prime bots shooting lasers as the princesses run. Micah as She-Ra lifts his sword in the air, and Swift Wind neighs and stomps the ground, sending out a ring of light, causing the bots to fall. They turn back, and Frosta stops in front of more bots]
Frosta [panting]: You want She-Ra? Come and get her! [she slams her ice fists into the ground and ice spread. When she’s done, bots are frozen in a huge ice sculpture. Robotic voices emit from more bots. All charge up their lasers at the princesses and Micah] 
Mermista: What do you think, Micah? Have we wasted enough of their time?
Micah [revealing himself]: Get my good side. [he winks and draws a magical illusion, pushing it towards the bots, causing fire to knock them down. Music plays as different scenes of the princesses are shown: Mermista and Perfuma drowning bots with water, Scorpia and Frosta punching bots until all is left is a pile of smoking robot parts. A ship engine roars as all look up to see Mara’s ship taking off]
Mermista/Perfuma: Whoo! Yes! 
Frosta: Yes! Go Adora, go go go! Go save my best friend!
Scorpia: I reinstate my hooray!
[Meanwhile, Micah as She-Ra turns back into Micah]
Swift Wind: You okay? I know you wanted to go.
Micah: But if I hadn’t stayed they wouldn’t be able to take off at all. They saved me. [Cut to Entrapta on the ship, slowly panning to Adora] I trust my daughter’s friends. They saved me. Now, they’ll save her. [Bow stands behind Adora] See you soon, baby girl. [Back to Etheria. The ship turns into a sparkle in the sky]
[New scene, Horde Prime’s flagship, the Velvet Glove. Glimmer’s alien dinner food] 
[Glimmer looks down at her food when the door zings and whirs to turns light enough to see Catra]
Glimmer: What, come to mock me some more? You heard Hore Prime. I’m supposed to be alone. So leave me alone. [she throws her food tray, leaving purple sauce dripping on the force field. Catra turns around as Glimmer’s expression turns sympathetic]
Glimmer: Wait. I’m sorry. Can--? Can you stay? Just for a little. 
Catra: Okay. [Catra sits down on one side of the force field, Glimmer sits back to back, causing a white ring to expand and disappear on the force field]
(Credits roll)
