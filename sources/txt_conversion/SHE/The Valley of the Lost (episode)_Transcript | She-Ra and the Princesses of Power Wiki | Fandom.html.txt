[It is a sunny, peaceful morning in Bright Moon. Inside the Bright Moon Castle's War Room, Adora, Bow and Huntara are waiting for Glimmer to arrive]
Adora: So, where's Glimmer again? Didn't she call us here?
Bow: [sounding slightly worried] Uh, I'm sure she'll be here soon.
[Glimmer teleports into the room, right in between Adora and Bow. Both of them scream]
Glimmer: [excitedly] You're all here! Good. Just one second. [Glimmer teleports out of the room again]
Adora: Glimmer... [groans]
Huntara: [smirking] Oh, I see. She's really taking this queen stuff seriously.
[Adora frowns slightly as Glimmer teleports back in with Mermista at her side]
Glimmer: As part of my new anti-Horde strategy, I'm sending you [points at Mermista], Adora, Bow and Huntara [points at each as she says their name] on a mission to retrieve Mara's ship from the Crimson Waste. Then, Bow will repair it and then we'll have a spaceship! Take that, Horde. [pumps her arms out as imaginary punches]
Adora: Uh, Glimmer?
Glimmer: What?
Adora: The Crimson Waste is a desert. Doesn't Mermista need, like, water to use her powers?
[Mermista slurps her straw loudly as Glimmer looks over at her. She is clearly unimpressed. Glimmer turns back to Adora]
Glimmer: Oh, good point. Be right back! [Glimmer walks over to Mermista while waving. She subsequently teleports with Mermista]
Huntara: She gonna do that all the time now?
Adora: [crosses arms] Oh, definitely.
General Juliet: [entering the room] Did I hear the queen? She's needed in the defence meeting immediately.
[All look over as Glimmer teleports into the room, this time with Perfuma]
Perfuma: [sounding a little strained] Oh! Hello, everyone. What a wonderful... [sneezes, then breathes in] …interruption to my morning meditation, and to see so much of our beautiful planet before I've had my daily tea ceremony. [Perfuma's voice wobbles at the end of her sentence]
Glimmer: [guiltily] Sorry, I may have gotten a little lost on the way. [Perfuma wrings her hair, and water drips from it] But, like I was saying, the Waste has tons of plants which you can use to bring the ship back!
Perfuma: [stuttering slightly] The C... the Crimson Waste?
Glimmer: [performing finger-guns with one hand] That's the one! As my first act as queen, I'm sending you all on the mission while I… [Glimmer's voice changes from loud and happy to dejected, as does her posture] …stay back and do important queen duties.
Adora: Hey! Leave it all to us! It'll probably be a boring mission anyway. [Perfuma chuckles]
General Juliet: [urgently] Queen Glimmer, you are extremely late for your next meeting.
Glimmer: [sighs before looking up and smiling] Oh! We'll go the fun way. [teleports with the Bright Moon Guard; everyone else in the room gasps]
[Opening theme]

Scene Change
[Dreary music plays as Adora, Bow, Perfuma and Huntara walk through the Crimson Waste]
Perfuma: So... this is, like, your kingdom?
Huntara: [coldly] I'm not a princess.
Perfuma: [smiling] Still, it must be nice to be home. Do you miss it?
Huntara: I left. Now I'm back. [averts gaze] No need to make a big thing out of it.
Perfuma: Mm-hm!
[Silence reigns for a few moments. Huntara glances at Perfuma again, looking almost sympathetic]
Huntara: You, um, make flowers?
Perfuma: I control all plants. Watch. [Perfuma walks ahead. Huntara's gaze follows her as Perfuma goes over to a strange plant with spikes all over it]
Perfuma: [hums, before making a sound of confusion when her magic does not work]
Huntara: Uh-huh.
[Perfuma attempts to control the plant once more, making sounds of effort and exasperation. The plant transforms into a larger, less attractive form of itself]
Perfuma: It's just something I'm blessed to be able to- [Perfuma is cut off as the plant explodes, covering her in a green slime-like mixture. She gasps in dismay]
Huntara: [touching the goop while smirking] Uh-huh. Blessed. [Perfuma continues to make noises of disgust while Huntara walks up next to Adora] If we run into trouble, is Flower Girl gonna be able to handle herself?
Adora: Oh, Perfuma? Oh yeah, she's a demon in battle.
[Huntara looks over to Perfuma, who is attempting to rid herself of the goop while still making sounds of revulsion. She glances over at Adora again uncertainly]
Adora: Plus, I got this! [laughs as she pulls her arm up to her chest; both pairs of eyes are drawn to the golden bracelet Adora is wearing]
Huntara: A bracelet?
Adora: No. [a flash of light ensues and reveals the bracelet to be the Sword of Protection, which Adora is now holding up] This is how I'll carry my sword from now on! [another flash of light, transforming the sword back into the bracelet] It's pretty great, right? [runs ahead]
Huntara: [crosses her arms, clearly unimpressed] I know you trained with the Horde, too, but I think all this time with the princesses has made you soft. [the word 'soft' is emphasized. Adora gasps and turns around, clearly irritated]
Adora: [scoffs] Soft? Are you serious? I'm as tough as ever. I bet I can beat you to the ship.
Huntara: [snorts] Never gonna happen.
[An intense staring-contest succeeds between the two before they both suddenly run off in the same direction, racing. Bow stands and watches them elbow and push each other with his hands on his hips. Perfuma appears behind him, still trying to clean off the goop]
Bow: [sighs, before turning to Perfuma] Here, lemme help. [Bow readies an arrow, pointing it right at Perfuma]
Perfuma: [panicking] What are you...? [Perfuma is cut off when Bow releases the arrow, which covers her in water. She screams, but Bow is smiling proudly]
Bow: I'm trying to expand my arsenal with new tech. What do you think?
Perfuma: [sopping wet and speaking in disbelief] Why would you have an arrow for this? It just seems like there are easier ways! [sighs before changing her tone to a much softer one] Your intention was kind. Thank you. [looks up and smiles]
Bow: [holds out a hand for Perfuma to pull herself up with. Perfuma dusts herself off before the two continue to walk] Wanna talk about it?
Perfuma: I'm really trying to be zen about this, but if I'm being honest, and I always try to speak my truth, I just don't get cacti! They're just so rough and unfriendly!
Bow: Well... maybe if you give cacti a chance, you'll find that under that rough surface, she's a really great friend!
Perfuma: [confusedly] Huh?
Bow: Uh... this cacti thing is about Huntara, right?
Perfuma: [stops walking] What? No, I really mean cacti. They're the one plant I can't control or keep alive and everyone says they're so easy, [begins to walk angrily up the hill] but you still have to water them, and I always under-water then over-water and I... [Perfuma groans in frustration while Bow walks up behind her. She closes her eyes and hums]
Perfuma: [sighs] That's better. I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I greet each dawn with a centering morning ritual to make sure I am my best self but today my ritual was interrupted. And now I am here. Surrounded by cacti. Cacti that hate me. [Perfuma starts sobbing, turning to Bow and accepting a hug from him] How am I ever gonna use them to move the ship?
Bow: [patting Perfuma comfortingly, while having his gaze drawn over to something else] Uh... that may not matter. [Adora and Huntara are standing next to where Mara's ship used to be, but is now gone]
Adora: [panting, doubled over] I can't- I can't believe the Horde took the ship. Also [points at Huntara] I could've run more.
Huntara: Or it could've been any number of Crimson Waste scavengers. [teasingly, smirking] And I could've run more.
Perfuma: Gosh, well, I guess we'll just have to come back another time. [gasps as a device starts beeping. Huntara moves into a defensive position]
Adora: [copies Huntara] Yep, I'm ready.
Bow: Sorry… [pulls out the source of the beeping from his pocket] it’s my pad. I souped it up so Glimmer can check in.  [Bow’s pad stops beeping and Glimmer flickers up on the screen]
Glimmer: [eagerly] How’s the mission? Got the ship yet? [Bow chuckles]
Adora: [whispering urgently] No.
Bow: [looks up at Adora] Well…
Adora: [still whispering] Hang up. Bow-
Bow: There’s a small problem…
Adora: [still whispering] Turn it off. No, Bow. Stop it. [Adora’s body language is greatly exaggerated]
Glimmer: What’s Adora doing?
Bow: [hesitantly] Dancing! Because, uh… [Adora crosses her arms and glares at Bow} the mission is going just so great! [this is accompanied by an uncertain thumbs up from Bow. He glances at Adora before turning and continuing] But we, um, have to go do more mission stuff now! Talk later! [Bow waves, Glimmer’s eyes widen]
Glimmer: Wait, don’t- [Bow hangs up and Glimmer disappears from the screen. Bow sighs with relief]
Adora: There’s no reason to worry her. We’ll find the ship! [Adora waves her hand as if shooing a fly]
Huntara: This is my home turf. Huntara can track anything in the Waste.
Adora: [confidently] I’m an expert tracker too!  [Huntara looks at her sceptically, before smiling slyly]
Huntara: Then you know… it’s all in the sand. [Huntara kneels and takes a handful of sand. She then licks the pile of sand before wiping the rest of it off on her arm] Mm-hm. Rubber, mechanical. You may be right, [Huntara looks over at Adora, who is also getting a handful of sand] it was the Horde.
Adora: [licks sand off her hand reluctantly and speaks almost incoherently] Uh-huh. Definitely… definitely getting rubber, and, uh… uh, [spits sand out] sand. [spits more sand out and begins rubbing her tongue to get rid of the stuff]
Bow: We could also, you know, just… follow these. [Bow gestures to two large lines in the sand that go on into the horizon]

Scene Change
[Large birds fly over the group as they continue to trudge through the Crimson Waste. They walk in silence for a moment until Huntara, who is ahead, realises where they are going]
Huntara: Oh, of course. I should have known!
Bow: [uncertainly] Uh… should you though? Because I don’t see anything.
Perfuma: Oh well, we tried!
Huntara: [looks back and smiles at Perfuma] Don’t give up yet, Flower Girl. [Perfuma gasps and Huntara runs ahead, stopping at a large cliff. Before them, a valley stretches out, and in the valley is a huge population of houses, bridges and people] The Valley of the Lost. It's a smuggler's haven and my home.
[Adora, Bow, Perfuma and Huntara are shown walking through the Valley of the Lost. Horde soldiers will occasionally pass by as they go by multiple gatherings, of which one is a blacksmith's shop and the other a bug-fighting ring. Roars, shouts and cheers sound all around them. Huntara peers around a corner, where two Horde soldiers are standing, and quietly takes three beige robes, handing them over to Adora, Bow and Perfuma]
Adora: [while Huntara places the robe over her] How are we supposed to find anything in there?
Huntara: This has been my gang's base since I arrived here. Nothing can hide from me in this valley.
[The team keeps walking through the valley. They go past an alleyway where a deal seems to be happening; a robot hands a frog-like creature a bag of coins and, in return, receives a mechanical arm. The robot then takes out a Stun Baton, shocking the frog with it, and taking back his bag of coins]
[They proceed to walk past Horde soldiers, two of which are threatening a smaller frog-like creature]
Horde Soldier: [angrily] Come back here!
[From above, Double Trouble is shown to be watching the group]
[Huntara suddenly stops, and gasps, for she sees two of her former goons standing and talking to a creature. Huntara growls and Adora bumps into her. She gasps when she sees what Huntara is staring at. Huntara growls again and begins to walk forward, but is stopped by Adora]
Adora: No! [Huntara is pulled back by Adora, giving a little shout. Adora whispers to her friends] Shh. Catra’s goons are here.
Huntara: [spits, speaks angrily] They’re not her goons, they’re my goons. I just never got a chance to fire them. I’ll fix that now.
Perfuma: [nervously] Maybe it’s best to avoid confrontation?
Huntara: You afraid to fight, Flower Girl?
Adora: [steps in front of Perfuma and places a hand on Huntara’s shoulder, whispering] No, Perfuma’s right. If they’re here there are sure to be others, we’ll be outnumbered.
Huntara: I don’t like not fighting.
Adora: [still whispering] Understood. But finding the ship is our mission. [her attention is drawn to three Horde soldiers running in their direction]
Horde Soldier: [shouting and panting] They went this way, over here! [the soldiers run past Adora, Bow, Perfuma and Huntara, who have quickly hidden behind a pile of rocks]
Bow: [quietly] The Valley is crawling with Horde soldiers. And we still don’t know where the ship is!
Huntara: This is still my home. And I know who can help.

Scene Change
Catra: Careful! We need this junk intact so Hordak can make new weapons. [Catra frowns and growls when Scorpia drops a box of tools she was holding]
Scorpia: [apologetically] Oh, I am so sorry about that. That- this isn’t what I want to be happening right now! Okay, sorry, sorry. [Scorpia leaves the room after hastily packing the tools back into the box. Catra rolls her eyes slightly and looks down at a device she’s holding. She clicks it twice and it beeps]
[Footsteps sound behind her. Catra’s ears twitch]
Catra: That was fast.
Scorpia: What, did you miss me already?
Catra: [frowning] Just… don’t drop anything else.
Scorpia: [raising a pincer] Nah, these guys look like they’ve got it covered. [clicks and winks] I’d rather hang out in here with you. [Catra squints suspiciously and growls before pushing Scorpia against a crate]
Catra: [angrily] What is going on?
Scorpia: [walking into the room] Again, I am just so sorry about- [Scorpia screams when she sees the copy of her, then gasps] Okay! This is… this is a thing that I’m seeing. Are you also seeing two of me? [gasps again] Oh, I have a twin! I always felt this emptiness inside and like there was someone who would just understand. Oh, this is making so much sense to me! [takes a breath] Ugh, who am I kidding, Hordak probably cloned me. I signed a lot of paperwork at some point.
[Catra’s eye twitches]
Scorpia: [smiles weakly] Yeah, being quiet now.
Catra: [turning back to the other Scorpia, angrily, with her hands still on the copy’s shoulders] Who are you and what exactly are you trying to pull?
[The other Scorpia smiles deviously before changing form. The shapeshifter is a dark mass with green around the edges until they transform completely, revealing to be a copy of Catra herself. Catra screams and stumbles back. Scorpia gasps, looking over at her friend, wide-eyed]

Scene Change
[Huntara is shown walking down a staircase, with Adora, Bow and Perfuma trailing behind, still clothed in robes. Perfuma leans over to Adora]
Perfuma: [quietly, uncertainly] Are you sure we can trust her contact? [Huntara turns back to the three, her smile almost teasing Perfuma]
Huntara: You scared?
Adora: [hands on her hips as she scoffs] Of course not.
Huntara: Good, ‘cause we’re here. [Huntara points to a rather run-down shack with torn fabric out the front behind her, smiling. She then turns and walks towards it, Adora, Bow and Perfuma following, looking unsure. Huntara puts her hands on her hips and scans the shack, looking very unimpressed]
Huntara: [sounding disgusted] Ugh, who would pay for this junk?
Grox: Fools. [Grox reveals herself as she walks out behind the fabric covering the front of her shop. She’s smiling almost cunningly as she does so. Huntara puts on an unreadable expression: a small half-smile with her eyebrows slightly furrowed]
Grox: You shouldn't be here.[walks over to Huntara] It’s not safe. Hurry! [Grox points to the entrance of her shop, and the group darts in, the shopkeeper running in behind them. Grox looks outside cautiously while Huntara speaks]
Huntara: [quietly] Grox, what’s going on? Where’s the rest of the gang?
Grox: [lets the fabric fall over the entrance as she turns to Huntara] Hiding. The Waste has been infested with Horde scum since you left. [walks further into the shop, breaking eye-contact with Huntara] Can’t turn without running into them, interfering with business.
[Grox proceeds to spit in Perfuma’s direction. Perfuma jumps out of the way, making a disgusted noise when she does. Grox ignores her and walks in front of Huntara again]
Grox: Things here haven’t been easy. [Grox puts a metal arm over Huntara’s shoulder and smiles] You’re a real sight for small eyes.
Huntara: [smiles sadly] You too. Grox, I need your help. We’re looking for a ship
Grox: [puts her index finger up, smiling] And I’ve got just the thing to help. [Grox walks over to a cupboard, kneels and starts pulling things out. A red coat is one of these things, and it catches Bow’s attention. His eyes widen when he sees that it has the Horde symbol printed on it. Before Bow can say anything, Grox has stood up with a horn in her hands]
Grox: Aha. Found it. [Grox goes over to Huntara once again, a cunning smile on her face] Now, before I do this, Huntara, I need you to remember one thing. [She puts up her index finger again to emphasise the one] One very important thing you forgot. [Huntara narrows her eyes suspiciously]
Grox: This is the Crimson Waste. Trust no one. [Grox puts the horn up to her mouth and blows on it, creating a loud sound. Huntara gasps]
Grox: [shouts] I’ve got the rebel intruders! [Grox blows on the horn again but is quickly stopped by Huntara, who pounces on her and grips her neck. Grox is held up as Huntara questions her angrily]
Huntara: You sold us out? [Grox laughs, before stopping and glaring at Huntara] Look at you. The Huntara I knew would’ve seen this coming. You’ve gone…soft. [The word ‘soft’ is accentuated, similar to before. Huntara glares back and takes a deep breath, obviously about to say something, but is stopped by the sound of soldiers]
Horde Soldier: [from outside] They’re in there! Come on!
Adora: [urgently] Leave her. We have to go. [Huntara looks back at Grox and growls]
Huntara: [towards Grox, angrily] I’ll be back for you.
Grox: [heatedly] Run along now. That’s what you’re good at. [Huntara throws Grox onto the ground roughly. Adora, Bow and Perfuma start running, Huntara not far behind. Rogelio and another Horde soldier approach Grox, who is picking herself up]
Grox: [points in the direction the rebels ran] They went out the back!
[Adora, Bow, Perfuma and Huntara are still running. They stop when two of Huntara’s goons, the ones from earlier, appear at the end of the alley they’re going through. They’re holding what looks like broken pipes. One of them smacks it in their palm threateningly]
Huntara: [puts an arm out to stop her companions] Looks like there’s no avoiding a fight now, Princess. [Perfuma gasps, and Huntara takes out her staff. Adora transforms her bracelet into the sword again, holding it up in the air]
Adora: [shouts] For the honour of Grayskull! [A bright flash of light ensues, and it recedes to reveal She-Ra in Adora’s place, staring determinedly at Huntara’s goons. Bow nocks an arrow as She-Ra glances back and sees their Horde pursuers]
She-Ra: [points her sword towards a small cactus] Perfuma, cactus. Block off this alley so they can’t surround us. [Perfuma groans worriedly, but She-Ra doesn’t notice, turning around to block an attack from one of Huntara’s goons. Another runs forward and this time Huntara is the one to fight back]
Perfuma: [kneeling with her hands out towards the cactus. Her hands twitch and her brows furrow in concentration as she whispers to herself] You can do this. You can do this! [The cactus quivers slightly as Horde soldiers emerge from the corner, running towards the group. Beads of sweat form on Perfuma’s face while she focuses on the cactus]
[The cactus shakes violently before letting out a burst of sharp needles, all of them sticking onto Perfuma]
Perfuma: Ow, ow! Ugh, I can’t do this! [her posture slumps. Huntara growls in frustration when she sees that they’ve been surrounded]
Huntara: [grips Perfuma’s arm and sprints into an intersecting alleyway] Run! [Perfuma screams, and Bow follows, leaving She-Ra in a readied position. She looks around before setting her eyes on a shelf holding two barrels. She-Ra shouts as she hits it, making the two barrels fall, consequently knocking down two Horde soldiers. She-Ra follows her friend, more Horde soldiers in pursuit]
[The soldiers and one of Huntara’s goons run after She-Ra but lose sight of her around the corner. They proceed to run past the group, who have hidden behind a multitude of wooden crates]
[They sigh in relief, momentarily relaxing, before Bow’s pad begins to ring loudly. He screams and pulls it out quickly, fumbling with the buttons when he does. She-Ra and Huntara hush him urgently]
She-Ra: [whispering] Bow! Turn it off! [Bow continues to press random buttons before clicking on one that stops the ringing. Glimmer flashes up on the screen and groans loudly when she does]
Glimmer: Ugh! I’m in the middle of the most boring meeting. [Bow and Perfuma make insistent hand gestures, shushing her repeatedly]
Bow: [whispering] Can’t talk! We’re being chased through a smuggler’s den right now!
Glimmer: [gasps] You are? [loudly, eagerly] That sounds so fun!
Huntara: [quietly, angrily] Quiet that thing!
Bow: [quickly] I’m gonna have to call you back.
Glimmer: [eyes widening] Wait, don’t hang u- [Bow presses a button, making the screen go blank]

Scene Change
[Catra and Scorpia gape at a copy of the former. The Other Catra stands with their hands on their hips, smiling slyly]
Other Catra: Pleasure to meet you. [starts to walk towards Catra] The name’s Double Trouble, and I’m about to become your new best friend. [They face Catra, smiling. Catra glares at the copy of herself]
Catra: Oh yeah? I’m done with best friends. [the sound of locking handcuffs ensues, and Catra smiles. The Other Catra looks down at their now bound hands and scoffs, clearly irritated]
Catra: Enough games! [Catra proceeds to shove her copy onto a crate] What do you want from me?
Other Catra: [slyly] It’s not what I want from you, it’s what you want from me.
Catra: [places a hand on her copy’s shoulder, angrily] All I want from you is to stop being me!
Other Catra: Oh! [chuckles] Sorry. I plain forgot. Sometimes I just get so lost in my character. [As they say this, they blink unnaturally. Catra gasps and draws back, eyes wide]
[The copy of Catra proceeds to stand before changing form again. They spin before the dark mass disappears, revealing the real form of Double Trouble. They strike a pose]
Double Trouble: Ta-da! [proudly] Ah, thank you, thank you. [Scorpia gasps and steps back, putting a pincer to her head]
Scorpia: I gotta sit down. [She proceeds to do so, resting on another crate. Catra walks towards Double Trouble, frowning suspiciously]
Catra: This is what you really look like?
Double Trouble: [sitting down and nodding] More or less. [folds a leg over their other leg] Of course, we all wear costumes. I just happen to be able to wear other people as costumes. [looks up, smiling] For a price.
Catra: [arms folded over her chest] Huh. So it’s money you’re after.
Double Trouble: [laughs] Aren’t we all, darling? But if you don’t require someone with my… gifts, I’ll just take my business to the other side!
Catra: [sceptically] How exactly are you planning on doing that?
Double Trouble: [clicks sound, and they stand up] I have a knack for getting out of tight spots. [they lift up the cuffs that were bounding them, now unlocked]
Scorpia: [sounding impressed and a little scared] What?
Catra: [smiling cunningly] And you can change into anyone? Anytime? [places a hand on her hip]
Double Trouble: Ugh. Change? [fingers curl into air quotes] What I do is so much more than changing. [steps onto the crate, standing proudly] I prefer “transform”! My real gift is committing to my roles. Sure, I can physically replicate anyone, but that doesn’t mean a thing [shakes index finger] if you can’t be them emotionally. It’s an art.
[Catra looks down, before glancing back up at a Horde soldier who has just run in]
Horde Soldier: Rebels, in the valley! [Catra looks to be caught off-guard, before her features quickly contort into a devious expression]

Scene Change
[Horde soldiers are seen patrolling on skiffs and on foot. Adora peeks out from their hiding spot, before turning to Perfuma, who is attempting to take out the spikes in her skin and hair]
Adora: [worriedly] Perfuma, what happened out there?
Perfuma: Ow! Ah! [stops and looks up, speaking frustratedly] I hate cacti! [throws her arms up] There, I said it! I love and honour all things, except cacti! And I don’t like spitting or Crimson Waste! It is full of negative energy!
Huntara: [angrily, slamming her fist onto the ground] Well, it wasn’t always like this! It used to be a great place, where an honest criminal could carve out a life.
Perfuma: Well, it’s terrible now!
Huntara: I know! [both Perfuma and Huntara put their heads in their hands. Perfuma, still with cactus prickles all over her, fails at this]
Perfuma: Ouch! [groans]
[Bow’s device begins to beep again, and he takes it out. Adora comforts Perfuma while Glimmer flickers up on the screen once again]
Glimmer: [angrily] Did you seriously just hang up on me?
Bow: [nods before speaking defensively] Yeah, but just because we were running from the Horde. And now we’re hiding from the Horde. Also, the Horde has Mara’s ship.
[At this, Adora glares at Bow. Bow responds with an apologetic look]
Bow: [still defensively] Sorry!
Adora: [shifts the device in Bow’s grip so Glimmer can see her] We totally have it under contr-
Glimmer: [excitedly] Really? This is so cool. A dire situation. Odds against us. I can’t believe I’m missing this for a dumb meeting. Okay. Hang tight. I’m on my way!
Adora: Wait, wait, wait, Glimmer, don’t-
[Adora stops short when she sees Glimmer teleport on the screen. Bow hangs up and puts the device away]
Adora: We can’t wait for Glimmer. The Horde’s probably going to take the ship, or whatever they can get from it, back to the Fright Zone.
Bow: I think I know how to find it. [reaches behind him, pulling out the Horde coat from Grox’s shop] We’ll use this! [Adora, Perfuma and Huntara glance at each other. Bow turns the coat and pulls off a badge that was stuck on it. The thing beeps when he does]
Bow: [holding up the pin] Horde badges have tracking devices built in. That’s how they found Catra when we… [Bow’s voice lowers] …kidnapped her. [voice returns to normal as he pulls out an arrow] I can hack into their system and see where all of the Horde soldiers are in the valley! [brings his track pad closer to the badge, pulls out a cable and plugs it in] They’re sure to be with the ship.
[Bow’s pad lights up when the badge is plugged in. A few beeping sounds ensue until another picture flashes up on the screen]
Bow: [pad still beeping] And there’s our ship.

Scene Change
[The group stands next to a huge canyon, where Mara’s is visible at the very bottom]
Adora: I have a plan. But it’s gonna depend on you, Perfuma.
Perfuma: [sitting on a rock with her back to the others, dejectedly] We should probably come up with a different plan, then.
Adora: [sighs] Come on, Perfuma, you’re one of the strongest people I know. [puts a hand to her chest] If you hadn’t come to my rescue in the Battle of Bright Moon, I wouldn’t even be here right now.
Bow: Or me. You rescued me from the Fright Zone.
Perfuma: [unhappily] We’re not in the Fright Zone. We’re here, and I’m just a useless flower girl. [puts her head in her knees, sighing. Huntara shakes her head and approaches Perfuma, placing a hand on her shoulder]
Huntara: No, you’re not. [Perfuma’s head lifts a little] I’ve been wrong about a lot. I was wrong to leave my home, I was wrong about Grox, and I hope I’m wrong about you, because we need your help.
Perfuma: [uncertainly] You want my help? [Huntara smiles and offers a hand to Perfuma. Perfuma laughs and takes it, standing up]
Adora: [holds up the Sword of protections and shouts] For the honour of Grayskull!
[Transformation into She-Ra ensues. A Horde soldier is patrolling along a rickety wooden pathway when She-Ra appears in front of them, smiling determinedly]
She-Ra: [raises both eyebrows] Hello.
[The Horde soldier brings out their taser and runs towards She-Ra, who simply dodges the attack. The Horde soldier continues attempting to hit her but is prominently stopped, being grabbed by the wrist and thrown onto the path]
[She-Ra is forced to move out of the way when another Horde soldier shoots at her from another part of the canyon. Another shot is taken but this time it is blocked by the Sword of Protection. The canon is warming up to take another shot but is destroyed by one of Bow’s arrows before it can fire. Bow continues to disarm Horde soldiers while She-Ra deals with the other ones]
[Using her sword transformed into a lasso, she clears any remaining Horde soldiers from her path]
Catra: Hey! [She-Ra looks over to see Catra] Careful with the goods. [Catra subsequently jumps on to of She-Ra, shouting. They are both pushed over the ledge. A short fall is followed by a hard landing, creating clouds of dust]
[She-Ra tumbles from it and moves into a half-kneeling position. Catra jumps out of the cloud as well and attacks the princess with angry swipes. She-Ra dodges these before clutching her wrist and throwing her up, causing her to shatter a wooden path]
[Catra clings onto it and pulls herself up before feeling an injury that has appeared on her right cheek. She immediately stands up, dismissing the injury, and runs along the path, She-Ra following not far behind]

Scene Change
[Two Horde soldiers stand outside Mara’s ship. Huntara sneaks up behind them, staff in hand. Once she reaches them, Huntara whacks them both over the head, consequently knocking them out. She nods to Perfuma who had peeked out from behind some crates. Perfuma proceeds to walk over to some cacti glancing at them unsurely. She takes a deep breath and holds her arms out, trying to control the plants. She makes sounds of effort as Huntara guards her back. Huntara groans when she sees Perfuma making no progress]
Huntara: Ugh, focus! Um, uh… [starts to hum] Right? Do it with me. [continues humming. Perfuma joins in] You got it! Alright. [keeps humming. The cacti begin to grow slowly] Yeah, yeah. [the cacti hit the bottom of the ship, but don’t seem to be lifting it at all]
Perfuma: [groans] I’m not strong enough to lift this by myself. [gasps] I don’t have to be! We’re underground!
Huntara: [pushes away a Horde soldier] You’re just noticing that now?
Perfuma: You know what else is underground? Roots! [Perfuma moves her arms and cacti roots burst from the ground. Huntara’s expression displays surprise]
[The roots continue to grow, reaching Mara’s ship and lifting it slowly. Perfuma strains and summons more roots, which come crashing out from the sides of the canyon. Huntara gasps as she watches it unfold. More and more roots are summoned, and Mara’s ship begins raising much faster]
Perfuma: [excitedly, determinedly] These cacti have the most powerful root system I’ve ever seen! [laughs and looks over at Huntara] I was so wrong about them.
Huntara: [in awe] Oh, and I was definitely wrong about you, Flower Girl!
[While the ship is being lifted, She-Ra and Catra continue to fight with grunts and shouts. Catra swipes at She-Ra and the latter retaliates accordingly. Rocks and rubble fall behind them, caused by the roots. Bow is forced to move in order to not get crushed. Perfuma begins to struggle as rocks land on the ship, making the weight too much to lift]
Huntara: [gasps, before looking over to where She-Ra and Catra are fighting] We have a problem!
[She-Ra is momentarily distracted, and Catra takes this chance to disarm her. She-Ra manages to hold onto the ledge and Catra runs away, leaving the princess dangling while the wood breaks under her grip. She-Ra jumps over to avoid falling, grabbing her sword and striking a wood beam. This causes the bridge Catra is on to fall]
[She-Ra catches Catra, slams her against the wall and pulls a metal grate over, fitting it so that Catra is trapped behind it. Catra snarls]
She-Ra: [smirking] I’ve got something more important to do. It was fun distracting you, though.
[She-Ra subsequently launches herself onto the ship and proceeds to destroy the rubble that has landed on top of it. Both her and Perfuma begin to glow. Mara’s ship starts rising faster again while Perfuma makes noises of effort. Bow gapes at the sight of it]
[She-Ra destroys more rocks that fall, and eventually, the ship reaches the top of the canyon. Huntara whacks Perfuma on the back affectionately]
Perfuma: Oh! [Huntara and Perfuma laugh]
[She-Ra jumps off the ship and heads over to where Catra had been trapped. She-Ra gasps when she notices Catra has disappeared]
She-Ra: How did she get out of that? [transforms back into Adora as Bow, Perfuma and Huntara approach her]
Bow: Yeah!
Perfuma: Yes, we did it!
Huntara: [pulling Perfuma into a side-hug] I’m sorry I doubted you.
Perfuma: It’s alright. We were all on a journey of personal growth today. I was so wrong to insult your home… it turns out cacti have flowers too.
[Perfuma holds up a flowering cactus-headband and Huntara takes it, placing it on her head. The two smile at each other as Glimmer teleports into the scene, holding her father’s staff in a ready-to-strike stance]
Glimmer: [looks around as seaweed falls off her] Hey, you didn’t save any bad guys for me! I made it here as soon as I could, I only got a little lost… in the ocean. [picks a piece of seaweed off herself] Aw. You should’ve waited for me.
Adora: [apologetically] Sorry… but we did get the ship! Your first mission as queen is a success!
Glimmer: [smiles] Hm.
Huntara: Queen Glimmer, I need to stay, and take the waste back for the rebellion and for my people. I won’t abandon my home again.
Perfuma: Aw, say no, Glimmer! I’ve gotten fond of this desert rose.
Huntara: [picks up Perfuma and speaks threateningly] Let anyone hear you calling me that and I’ll throw you into another exploding cactus. [a moment passes before Huntara begins to laugh, the others slowly joining in, except for Glimmer, who crosses her arms]
Glimmer: Ugh, I don’t get it!
Adora: [pulling Glimmer into a side-hug] Eh, you had to be there. [Bow nods]

Scene Change
[Catra, Scorpia and Double Trouble ride through the Crimson Waste on a skiff. Scorpia claps]
Scorpia: [impressed] Wow! [chuckles] Bravo! [Double Trouble, who is disguised as Catra, bows as Scorpia applauds them]
Double Trouble: [still disguised as Catra, chuckling] Oh, stop. [they wave a hand and bow once more, before transforming back into their original form, speaking hopefully] Did you really like my audition?
Catra: [hand on her hip] “Like” doesn’t cover it.
Double Trouble: Well, I could’ve used more time to prepare. [jumps and walks towards Catra] Really… get into your skin.
Catra: I grew up with Adora, and you fooled her. [Double Trouble gasps, smiling] If you can do that, we can do anything. [smiles deviously] This is gonna be fun.
[Credits roll]
