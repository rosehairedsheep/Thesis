[in the Crimson Waste, a bug extends a spike and catches a fly. Camera changes to show Adora atop a rock and looking out over the land]
Adora: [sighs] Thanks for coming with me, guys. [hops down]
Bow: Of course.
Adora: And the queen is really okay with us taking off? I would've thought a mission to the Crimson Waste would've been too risky for her.
Glimmer: Oh she hates this idea, which is why I didn't tell her where we were going. Besides, it's not like anyone else has a plan to stop Hordak from opening a portal. You're right. Tracking Mara's message to the source is the best lead we have. 
Bow: [walking along with the other two] Plus, for an inhospitable desert, this place is kind of beautiful. [a bird flies by in front of them] Aw, there's even a cute little bird!
[they watch the bird perch on a cactus before shouting as the bird screamed and turned to ice]
Bow: Never mind, this place is terrifying!
[the bird falls off and crashes to the ground] 
Adora: Okay, I know it's scary and dangerous, but if there is something to do with portals out here, we have to find it for the Rebellion. And... for me.
[Bow lightly pats her on the head with his tracker pad, getting a smile out of her]
Adora: Which way now, Bow?
Bow: Uh... [laughs nervously] So, uh, slight problem. Uh, my tracker pad, it's dead.
Adora: [looks over his shoulder with Glimmer to see a cartoon Bow head with x-ed out eyes and his tongue out] So, we're without a map. and the plants are evil. Heh. But it's okay, we're coming from the north.
[Glimmer teleports out of the way as Adora kicks a rock, knocking off the top of it and picking it up with the flat side up]
Adora: And, uh, I'm something of an expert tracker, thanks to the Horde's survival skills training. [picks up a needle and set it on top of the rock piece] We just have to keep going... [the needle stops spinning and points one direction] that way. Problem solved! I've got this under control. [laughs and walks off]
[Bow follows her with Glimmer close behind, who stops and turns as she notices something, staring at a skeleton in guard armor]
[screen goes black and intro plays]

New scene
[At the Fright Zone, camera zooms in to show Entrapta working with Hordak and talking into a recorder]
Entrapta: Day 135, this could finally be it. Initiating first test. Here we go. [hair takes the recorder from her as she spun and hit a button] Aha!
[both watch as the machine creates a large bubble of electric energy, which picks up pieces of a portal and spins them into place, a portal forming. Hordak smirked and looked down at Entrapta, who gasped as the portal started growing unstable]
Entrapta: Something's wrong. I'm turning it off. [rushes forward]
Hordak: No, you fool! [chases after and grabs her arm] It'll blow!
[the machine blows up with them right in front of it, making the screen completely white momentarily. Once the light dies down it shows Hordak and Entrapta to the floor with Entrapta unconcious.]
Hordak: [grunts and sits up]
Entrapta: [sits up as well] This doesn't make sense. It should work. The machine didn't have enough power, so we added First Ones Tech. [stands and walks over to the destroyed machinery] Then it was blowing out the power grid, so we rerouted it. Now it's powered, it's functioning, but it won't activate a portal. It's like there's a key. Maybe when Catra brings that tech back from the Crimson Waste--
Hordak: [laughs darkly] Catra is never coming back from that fool's errand. The machine is a failure. We're done here. Get out.
Entrapta: That was just our first test. If we try--
Hordak: [turns to face her, snapping] I said, we're done! [turns away again]
[Entrapta gets pulled out of the room by the sky bot and Emily, Hordak slamming his fist down and Entrapta glancing back at him sadly before the door closed]

New scene
[Adora, Glimmer, and Bow in the Crimson Waste, screaming while running from three snakes. They go off an edge and slide down, the snake peering over at them before leaving]
Adora: Okay, to review, the plants are evil, tech doesn't work, and sometimes, a sand dune is a pile of very angry, sand-colored snakes. So, [pants] I think we're getting the hang of this.
Glimmer: [groans and stands up] Why can't I just teleport us to the center of the Waste?
Bow: [stands up on the other side of Adora] Because you don't know where it is and would run out of power before we made it.
Glimmer: Oh, thank you for reminding me that my powers are limited. [walks off] You think I don't know--? [falls right down through the sand]
Adora: Glimmer! [dives in after her]
Glimmer: [suddenly appears next tot Bow, unharmed] I'm fine. [chuckles] Where's Adora?
[Bow points at the same spot where Adora dove, Glimmer groaning before teleporting, soon reappearing with Adora]
Adora: [panting and holding onto Glimmer] And quicksand. [Glimmer spits out some sand] That is now on our list of things to avoid. Wow, I'm learning so much today.
Bow: Adora, you know we support you all the way, but maybe we're not prepared for this.
Adora: We just need a little rest. I'll figure out how to build a shelter--
Glimmer: [turns and points] Or we could go there?
[Adora makes binoculars with her hands and squints before Bow hands her actual binoculars and makes a thumbs up. Camera shows through thee binoculars, showing a large skeleton of some animal and blankets draped through some of it]
Adora: Okay, problem solved. We'll get out of the heat, and maybe there's a map or water inside.
Bow: [follows Adora in through the mouth of the skeleton with Glimmer] Adora, I doubt there's anything useful here. The Crimson Waste's been abandoned for hundreds of--
[Adora and Glimmer gasp as Adora pulls back the curtain and they look in to see it was a bar with a bunch of people in it, all of which turned to face the group with narrowed eyes]
Adora: [quietly to the other two] Just act tough. Try to blend in.
Glimmer: [nods and makes a 'tough' face, pretending to spit as she followed Adora] Ha.
Bow: [peers in and sighs with a roll of his eyes, reluctantly following them] Good afternoon, fellow patrons. Except, I don't even care if you do have a good afternoon, because I'm bad. [flexes]
Glimmer: Bow!
Adora: [walks up to the counter and leans on it] Hi. Is this the center of the Crimson--? [pauses when the bartender turned away to put a glass on the shelf] Excuse me? Hello? We-- [huffs when she walks away] Okay, that didn't work.
Glimmer: [chuckles nervously from behind her] Adora, I'm not so sure these are the kind of people we should be asking for help.
Bow: [nods]
Adora: [stands on a table and accidentally knocked over a bit of someone's drink, raising her hand] Hello. Sorry to interrupt, uh, but we're not from around here, [ignores Bow and Glimmer who were signaling her to stop talking]  and we're hoping someone would give us directions?
[a purple, buff goat lady and a dark blue lizard walked up]
Goat Lady: You're outsiders.
Adora: Uh, yeah, I guess we are.
Goat Lady: [pulls Adora down and sits her on the table while the lizard guy grabbed the other two] We don't like outsiders here. And since the Crimson Waste didn't take care of you... we will.
[glass breaks behind them, a man falling to the ground as someone walked up to them]
Goat Lady: [nervously] We didn't mean to disturb you.
[both her and the lizard guy are thrown outside, grunting as they landed face first in the sand]
Buff Lady: There's only two rules in the Crimson Waste. One, the strong make the rules. And two, [turns and glares] don't annoy me while I eat. I made rule one. They broke rule two. [all gasp as she clenches her fist] Are you all staring at something?
[all the other people in the bar looked away, quickly resuming what they were doing previously while the lady walked up to the group]
Buff Lady: Kids, what are you doing, asking these lowlifes for help? Don't you know you can't trust anyone in the Crimson Waste?
Glimmer: [laughs nervously while standing behind a sparkly-eyed Adore] Actually, up until two minutes ago, we didn't know there was anyone in the Crimson Waste.
Buff Lady: Scoundrels, criminals, outlaws, all of them. Be careful, kids. Next time, I might not be around to save you. [walks off]
Adora: Oh, wow. We need her. 
Glimmer: What?
[Adora runs off and up to the buff lady, who was seemingly flirting with the waitress]
Adora: Excuse me? Hi, can we join you? Great.
[waitress giggles and runs off, the buff lady huffing and picking Adora up, setting her in the chair across from herself next to Bow and Glimmer]
Adora: I'm Adora. This is Bow and Glimmer. And we came to--
Buff Lady: [slams her cup down on the table with a clang] Blondie, Boy, Glitter, got it. Huntara. Now what do you want? [glances over at the waitress before Glimmer stuck her head in the way]
Glimmer: It's Glimmer. Princess Glimmer.
Huntara: [staring her down coldly and towering over her] Oh, a Princess. Me too. I'm the Princess of the Crimson Waste. Can you tell? Or am I not sparkly enough for you?
Adora: We're looking for something in the center of the Crimson Waste. It's important we find it. You seem like you know this place well. Can you take us?
Huntara: [sitting back down] Did you not hear what I just said about trusting people?
Adora: Well, yeah, but you said that while saving us. So, you can't be all bad. What do you say?
Bow: [laughing and sets a hand on Adora's arm] Excuse us for one moment.
[Bow and Glimmer both turn around, Bow turning Adora as well]
Bow: [whispering] You sure about this, Adora? All the scary people are scared of Huntara, which is not usually a great sign.
[they all turn around to peer at Huntara, who takes a sip of her drink before taking a bite out of the edible cup, turning around again]
Glimmer: We can just ask for a map or--
Adora: A map won't get us past the scary plants or quicksand or whatever else is out there. We need a guide.
Huntara: [suddenly stands up] If I say no, you'll go out there and get yourselves killed, is that it?
Glimmer: I mean, not ideally, but yeah.
[Huntara smirks and picks up her weapon and spins it, the both ends of it retracting into itself. She put it in the holder on her waist, leaving the others in awe]
Huntara: Well, looks like you've got yourselves a guide. [extends her hand to them]
Adora: Great! [shakes her hand with both of her own] See, guys, problem solved.

New scene
Entrapta: [to Emily] I know Hordak told me to go away, but I have some ideas for the portal machine.
[Emily pushes her back when Entrapta tried to run off] 
Entrapta: Emily, will you cut that--? [grunts as she's pushed up against a tank full of vitrine. She looks inside, staring at the small organism floating in it, hooked up to tubes] Curious.
[she turns as she hears a noise, seeing machines taking off Hordak's armor for him and Hordak panting]
Entrapta: [quieter, to Emily] Okay, Emily, you might have a point.
[Emily nods and begins backing away]
Entrapta: Quietly, quietly. [she accidentally steps on a cord that drops a barrel, not daring to move as she listened to the bakground clanging noises, yelping as a larger machine fell right behind her]
[Hordak growled and looked over at her]
Entrapta: Uhh.. hi.
Hordak: Get out. [turns and gets louder] Get out right--! [groans as he falls to the ground, seeing Entrapta running over before his eyes close]

New scene
[Huntara places her weapon on top of a stone, picking it back up when it pointed them in the right direction, starting to walk with Adora close behind her and the other two behind her]
Adora: So, heh, for a place that's supposed to be uninhabitable, the Crimson Waste sure is habited.
Huntara: The Crimson Waste takes in all sorts. They come running from the law, from their enemies, from different kingdoms.
Adora: From the Horde?
Huntara: [growls] The war will destory all those idiots caught up in it.
Adora: What are you running from?
Huntara: [whips around and uses one hand to push her against the stone wall, the other hand spearing a bug right next to Adora's head] Huntara doesn't run from anything. You got that? [lets her go and looks at the bug] I want to be here. [she then bites off the head of the bug, chewing it as she walks off]
Adora: Wait. [she runs after Huntara, throwing a small rock ahead of them as a test and seeing it sink into the quicksand]
Huntara: Huh. Not bad, Blondie.
Adora: What can I say? I'm a fast learner.
Huntara: Cocky. Heh, I like that. Give it some time, you'll do well here.
Adora: No, thanks. This has been a really terrible, snake-filled day. Honestly, I don't know what we would've done without you.
[Huntara's expression softens as she smiles down at her before realizing she was doing so, wiping it off as she grunted and continued walking, Adora behind her and the other two dragging themselves along as well]
Bow: [whispering to Glimmer] We should say something.
Glimmer: No, we are supporting her. Now, sh!
Bow: You shush. Shh.
Glimmer: Shh!
[both continue loudly shushing each other in the background]
Bow: No you. Quiet.
Glimmer: What? You!
Huntara: Your travel companions are loud.
Adora: Hah, well, it's been a long trip from Bright Moon.
Huntara: Bright Moon? [grunts and walks ahead a bit faster]
Bow: [walks up and sets a hand on Adora's shoulder] Listen, I know my tracker pad isn't working, but I'm sure we're going the wrong way, definitely a different way than we'd been going.
Adora: We wouldn't be going anywhere without Huntara. This is probably just a shortcut.
Huntara: We're here.
[Huntara leads them through a doorway, the group looking around at what was more or less a wide pit with ledge-steps going down into it and a rock in the middle.]
[the group head down into it, looking up at the rock]
Glimmer: Uh.. we're where?
Adora: [lightly kicks at the rock] This can't be the center of the Crimson Waste. There's nothing here. There has to be something here. I was so sure! The message said-- [she gets cut off by being shot in the thigh by a paralyzing dart, which she quickly took out and looked at] What? [groans and collapses to the ground]
Glimmer: [teleports to her side] Adora! [yelps as she gets hit with a dart as well and passes out]
[Bow readies an arrow and looks around, dodging a dart before getting hit in the back of the neck with a second one and passing out as well]
Adora: [grunts as she tries to reach for her sword] For the honor of-- [collapses back down]
Huntara: [walks over and picks up a dart, examining it] Paralyzing darts. But you probably figured that out, being a fast learner and all.
[Adora, Glimmer, and Bow are thrown into a deep hole, where they still just lay there and listen to Huntara]
Huntara: Outsiders are a risk to all of us. I did tell you not to trust anyone, Blondie.
[Adora then finally passes out]

New scene
[Hordak gasps in pain, sitting with a blanket around him]
Entrapta: Ta-da! I made you soup. Soup always makes me feel better.
[pieces of her hair raise spoonful after spoonful of the soup to Hordak, who refuses them and hisses, setting the tray of mini soup bowls down by the mini spy]
Entrapta: Okay, I know one big soup is probably better, but theyre so cute!
Hordak: I am not discussing this.
[he tries to get up only to fall again, Entrapta catching him with her hair and looking at his back]
Entrapta: Your armor, it's holding you together..
Hordak: [pulls away] It is none of your concern.
Entrapta: You're from another planet. That thing in the vitrine looks like you. And you've got tech compensating for your body. As a scientist, I'm not going to stop until I figure out what's going on. Now, tell me everything!
[the spy creature sniffs at the soup before crying out and turning away from them]
Hordak: You want to know what I am; I am a clone! A clone of the emperor of the known universe, Horde Prime. Horde Prime cloned himself, building an army to conquer all he saw. Planets, worlds, galaxies fell before us. I was his top general, but there was a defect in my cloning, and defects are worthless to Prime. I was sent to die on the front lines, but during battle, a portal opened and sent me crashing to Etheria, stranding me here. With nothing but a broken ship, I built an empire. When my portal opens, I shall bring forth my brother's armies to crush The Rebellion, and Horde Prime will see that he was wrong. I am not a defect. I am worth something!
[he grunts and hits his fist against the tank of vitrine] 
Hordak: But the portal machine does not work. I haven't conquered the planet. I could not even clone a new body for myself. Perhaps-- Perhaps Prime was right.. I am a failure.
[he looks over as he hears clanging, Entrapta going through machinery things and tossing them aside with her hair as she searched]
Entrapta: Oh, no, no, no. I'm listening, I heard you. I've got an idea, but I need my tools. Be right back.
[she uses her hair to pull herself up somewhere, Hordak groaning a bit]

New scene
Glimmer: [panting in exhaustion] Alright, ninth time's the charm. Everyone, hold on. One, two...
[they all appear just above the hole from Glimmer's teleporting, falling right back down with a grunt]
Adora: Bow, are you okay?
Bow: [voice cracking from pain] Luckily, everyone landing on my ribs distracts from the other bruises.
Glimmer: I'll get it this time. Hold on.
[they all get teleported up again, landing just outside of the hole this time]
Glimmer: [tearing up] Ugh, I'm sick of this! We've been tricked, robbed, temporarily paralyzed. Now we're stuck here in the middle of--
Bow: Glimmer!
[both of them look over at Adora, who stared down at the hole with a guilty expression]
Glimmer: I mean, I'm so glad we finally got out of there.
Bow: Adora?
Adora: [sighs and gets up, leaning against a rock and covering her face] Having this mission made me feel in control. After the last few days, I really needed it. I needed answers. I thought if I found out more about Mara, I'd find out more about myself, where I came from and why.
[Bow sets a hand on her shoulder and Adora looks back up at them]
Bow: And we'll still get those answers. We're not beat yet. Sure, this road trip has been kind of a disaster.
Glimmer: [chuckles] Pretty standard for us, honestly.
Bow: But we know you're going through a lot, and we've got your back, whatever you need to do.
Glimmer: Besides, it's not like you stole our weapons and left us stranded.
Adora: It's Huntara.
Glimmer: Exactly. It's Huntara's fault.
Adora: No, it's Huntara. [gesturing down at the large footprints in the sand that led them back]

New scene
[Fright Zone, Hordak's Sanctum]
[Entrapta holds up a blowtorch that hisses as the flame shoots out]
Entrapta: [trills] Oooh, this is gonna be so much fun! [runs off]
[Hordak and Imp sit on a metal chair/throne while Emily beeps intermittently nearby]
Hordak: [arms crossed, grumpily] I do not need your help in this.
Entrapta: [using her hair to adjust things out of frame] Everybody needs help sometimes. And you shouldn't be upset that your're not perfect--take Emily! [Emily rolls on her belly and beeps] Her programming is glitchy, the left leg sticks, and she's loud. [Emily spins in place and beeps louder] Emily's got quirks, but that's why I like her. [a hair tendril reaches over and pats Emily with a couple metallic thumps] Imperfection is what makes scientific experimentation possible. Imperfection is beautiful. [Sparks begin to fly around Entrapta and make firework and electrical screeches as she works on something out of frame, illuminating her face as she smiles] At least to me.
[Hordak stares at her in amazement; Entrapta reaches a hair tendril around him and picks him up]
Entrapta: Stand here! [sits him down nearby and raises his arms into a T-pose as he grunts in surprise] And you're really too obsessed with this whole failure thing, I mean, I'm a failure...
Hordak: You are not a f--[Entrapta shushes him and covers his mouth with a hair tendril]
Entrapta: [continues working on things out of frame] I don't fit in. [pulls her welding mask down over her face] I became friends with Adora, but she abandoned me... Then, I became friends with Catra, but she doesn't talk to me anymore... [pulls her mask back up and turns to smile at Hordak, pressing a button on a remote with her hair causing an alarm to go off and machines to begin welding the armor onto Hordak's body] But that doesn't mean I give up. I scrounged up a few more pieces of First Ones Tech, and I can't think of a better use for it than this. [Hordak grunts as the pieces are welded together; finally the machines recede and Hordak tests his grip; Entrapta trills happily] Ta-da! Your armor is more of an exoskeleton now, the tech compensating for your organic body. [Hordak flexes his new muscles, breathing out; Entrapta whispers excitedly] What does it feel like?
Hordak: [happily, darkly] Powerful. [chuckles darkly, then stops abruptly, looking away from Entrapta and speaking haltingly] I...I...acknowledge the work you put into this. It is...very...technologically sound.
[Hordak looks down at Imp, who kicks him lightly on the foot, screeching and gesturing a shrug in disapproval]
Hordak: [flounders a moment] Uh...no matter what you say, you are not a failure. [finally looks back at Entrapta and enunciates his words with gestures] Any who discount you are utter fools!
Entrapta: [putting a hair tendril on his shoulder lightly, smiling] Thanks. I like being friends with you, too.
[Hordak smiles and settles]

New scene
[Crimson Waste, Huntara's campsite]
[Huntara and her goons sit around a fire as Huntara stares at and turns the Sword of Protection in her hands]
Horned Goon Girl: [analyzing the tip of one of Bow's arrows] What do you think this one does? [shouts in surprise as a net flies out and ensnares her]
Huntara: [gets up and grunts impatiently, cutting away the net from the goon] Stop messing around.
Horned Goon Girl: Come on, we're just having fun. Didn't you see the shock on those outsiders' faces? [Huntara growls angrily in response and turns to walk away while the Four-Armed Lizard Girl watches warily behind; mockingly] Aw, look at this. I think Huntara liked them. [Huntara stops and the lizard girl grows shocked and scared, letting out a frightened roar] Are you feeling guilty?
[Huntara drops the sword and it stabs deep into the rock, clanging; Huntara grabs the horned goon and throws her up against a rock wall, the goon grunting in surprise and pain]
Huntara: I did what I had to, to keep us all safe.
Horned Goon Girl: [laughs humorlessly] You mean keep yourself safe. You act so tough, but you're running scared from something just like the rest of us.
[Huntara growls and forcefully punches just to the side of the goon's head, making her grunt in fear]
Huntara: I don't run away from anything! I am Huntara of the Crimson Waste. 
[A burst of sparkle magic hits Huntara in the side of the face, making her grunt]
Glimmer: [falling from the sky] That's nice. I'm Princess Glimmer of Bright Moon, and I sparkle!
[Glimmer throws another sparkle bomb before teleporting away; the bomb knocks the horned goon away and Glimmer ports in between Huntara and the goon, groaning as she strains to pull the sword from its sheathe in the ground; Huntara sees this and runs at her, sliding and kicking the sword out of her hands with a shout; the sword spins in the air and Huntara snatches it and points it at Glimmer, now on the ground; Glimmer glances to the side and dives for Bow's bow and arrows, teleporting away; Huntara growls in anger as she and the goons look around for Glimmer; Adora sprints up and tackles Huntara from behind, both grunting as they fall to the ground; arrows fly in and land near the horned goon, making them groan and run as Glimmer ports where they were and taunts the four-armed lizard girl with a raspberry, making the lizard girl jump after her a couple times as she ports away]
Adora: [still pinning Huntara; acknowledging the Sword] That's mine.
Huntara: Then come and take it! [kicks Adora off her back, making her grunt in pain]
[Huntara flips away, and Adora flails for a moment, almost losing her balance, then regains it and flips away, sliding into place; Adora shakes her head and stares down Huntara as she fancily flips it around in her hand; Adora smirks and pulls out Huntara's staff, fancily flipping it]
Huntara: [angrily] That's mine.
Adora: Then come and take it! [thrusts the spear forward with a mighty grunt, only to falter when the tip doesn't extend]
[Huntara rushes Adora, growling, while Adora twists the staff unsuccessfully, looking up and gasping when she sees Huntara sprinting at her; Adora gives a final twist to the staff and strains, then hits the top and sets off the sharp extension, shouting in surprise, just as Huntara reaches her, parrying a swipe of the sword with the staff; they trade parries and continue to clash and strain against each other, grunting, until Huntara headbutts Adora]
[Near the rockface surrounding the camp, Bow runs along the edge, arrows readied as the horned goon shoots blow darts at him; he dodges and fires two arrows, pinning the goon's shirt to a rock behind them, making them shout; Bow slides down the rockface just as the goon pulls the arrow out and begins to run, but Bow fires a net arrow, encasing them against the rock]
Bow: [triumphantly] Ha!
[Behind Bow, a rock explodes into dust as the lizard goon jumps around, hammering the spaces Glimmer teleports out of; Glimmer ports in and taunts the goon again, making them roar and rush her; she teleports away just as they reach her and punch the rock wall behind, making the foundation crumble; Glimmer teleports to the top and kicks it swiftly, making rocks rain down on the now groaning in fear lizard girl; a rock knocks them on the face as they are buried, then Glimmer ports to where Bow is standing and they both assess Bow's handiwork with the horned goon in the net, humming; they then turn to where Adora is grunting, fighting Huntara, and teleport away]
[Huntara and Adora continue to clash weapons, straining against the other's blows; finally, Huntara kicks Adora and sends her flying, knocking the staff from her hands; Adora slides to one knee and looks up to find Huntara pointing the sword tip at her neck, making her scowl; Huntara looks away a moment, then shouts and swipes the sword in an arc meant to take Adora's head, but Adora dodges and rushes Huntara, headbutting her and sending her reeling back; Adora continues forward and kicks Huntara, sending the sword flying; Adora flips herself to land away as the sword stabs near Huntara who holds her head and shakes it; Glimmer teleports next to the sword and pulls it out, making Huntara gasp in surprise.]
Glimmer: Quick! Time for She-Ra! [tosses the sword spinning to Adora who grasps it confidently]
Huntara: [aghast] Wait! You know about She-Ra?!
Adora: [smugly] Know about She-Ra? [chuckles] I am She-Ra. For the Honor of Grayskull.
[A light encompasses Adora as she transforms into She-Ra]
Huntara: [confused] She-Ra...is a person?
She-Ra: [walks to Huntara and lifts her jaw with the sword tip, reversing their earlier roles] Where did you hear about She-Ra? After all, it's not like it's something they teach you...in the Horde.
Huntara: I was a Horde soldier. They told us we were heroes, freeing Etheria from the evil princesses. But when I saw what we were doing...how Hordak just...threw soldiers away...well. You know what we saw. You were one of us. That's where you learned to fight, isn't it? I'd recognize that training anywhere.
She-Ra: [lowers the sword to lean down and look Huntara in the eye] You deserted. I did, too. And I joined the Rebellion.
Huntara: Then you're a fool. One girl can't make a difference against the might of the Horde, even a tall, shiny girl like you. It's useless to try.
She-Ra: Maybe, but I'm not alone. I won't stand by and watch people get hurt. And I won't run away. [Huntara scowls and looks away, but She-Ra grabs her chin and gently pulls her face to look back at her] Huntara, I need your help. I need you to help us find what we came for. Together, we can all bring this war to an end--
Horned Goon Girl: [holding Glimmer aloft in a chokehold as the lizard girl stands behind Bow with his arms up] You need to drop your weapons.
[Glimmer struggles and groans in the goon's grip as they smile menacingly at She-Ra with the blow-dart gun readied against Glimmer's neck]
Horned Goon Girl: Come on, Huntara. Let's grab our loot and go.
[Huntara walks up to the goon and places a hand on her shoulder gently; then, Huntara tightens her grip to squeeze her shoulder painfully, making her grunt; Huntara tosses the goon into the lizard girl, making her drop a shrieking Glimmer; the goons roar and shout in surprise and fear and run away]
Huntara: [picking up and assessing her staff] You're right. What I saw in the Horde scared me, and I ran. [makes the sharp ends of the staff retract] But I'm not gonna run anymore. [puts the staff away and walks to She-Ra] I face my problems head-on. And if you're trying to stop the war, then... [pauses, then offers her hand] then I will do what I can to help you. [She-Ra smiles and clasps Huntara's hand and shakes] Now come on, we've got lots of ground to cover before we reach the ship.
She-Ra: What ship? [Glimmer teleports next to her and Bow leans in to look after Huntara walking away]
[They all crest the top of a ridge and look ahead, Adora de-transformed; a large metal ship protrudes from the ground a distance away]
Bow: [mystified] Adora...what is that?
Adora: [shocked] It's...it's Mara's ship.
