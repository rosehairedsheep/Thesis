[Mara's ship cuts through space]
Adora: Okay, She-Ra, I know you're in there. 
[Adora closes her eyes]
Bow: Oh, you almost had it. 
Adora: {gasps} Will you stop distracting me?!
Bow: Sorry, but there definitely was some glow-y action going on there. 
Glimmer: Come on, Adora. You can't let distractions keep you from transforming. 
Catra: What's going on? Ooh! Are we messing with Adora? {grunts}
Adora: Catra, do you have to sit right there? 
Catra: What? I'm not doing anything.
Glimmer: Adora, concentrate!
Catra: Yeah, Adora, concentrate. 
Bow: You can do it. 
Catra: {purring}
[Catra sits in Adora's lap. Adora closes her eyes and reaches out her arm]
Adora: {grunts} 
[Adora's eyes glow blue and golden light radiates from her hand]
Entrapta: This way!
Adora: {groans} 
Entrapta: Oh, hi, Adora. Don't mind us. 
Adora: Entrapta, do you have to do that in here?
Entrapta: Yes. This is where the signal is strongest. We're less than a day out from Etheria. We'll be in range to send a message to the Rebellion soon. 
Glimmer: I, I can't believe...I'm a day away from meeting my dad. It's been so long. I barely remember him. 
[Bow puts a hand on Glimmer's shoulder. Catra hops off Adora's lap and looks out the window.]
Adora: Ready to be home? 
Catra: Not really. Okay, fine. Maybe. 
Entrapta: {cackles} 
Bow: What do you think's going on right now on Etheria? 

[Horde ships surround the planet.  Mermista dawns a fedora; Perfuma puts on red lipstick and Sea Hawk adjusts his cuffs. Scorpia wears a gown.]
Sea Hawk: Our friends have still not returned from their perilous space mission. So, it's up to us to save Etheria. Onward, to a secret, underwater party adventure! 
Mermista: {groans} 
[Theme Song]
Scorpia: {chuckles} Okay, so, it's not that I didn't understand the plan, but I didn't understand the plan. Why are we dressed like this?
Sea Hawk: Because it's a secret undercover mission to find Prince Peekablue. The reclusive Peekablue is a hermit. But he was spotted at the top-secret Enchanted Grotto's underwater soiree. A gathering place for all well-heeled criminals of Etheria. 
Perfuma: Hmph! So, he'll show up to a criminal enterprise, but won't so much as RSVP to my drum circle so I know how many drums to have? 
Scorpia: All right, yeah, I got it. And, uh, why do we need him? 
Mermista: Because Peekablue has the power of Farsight. He can magically see to the edges of the universe and if we recruit him, he can tell us where Adora and the others are. We have to warn them that Prime is chipping people on Etheria and get them back ASAP. No one at the soiree can know we're there. So, I've assigned everyone undercover aliases. 
Sea Hawk: {gasps}
Mermista: Scorpia, you're Lynda D'Ream, a farmer and mother to five little scorpions. 
Scorpia: {chuckles} "Lynda D'Ream"? I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm not exactly great at lying or pretending or blending in. I mean, I'm just the muscle. Not a spy.
Mermista: Nonsense, Lynda. You were born for this role. Perfuma, you're Tara, a blacksmith. 
Perfuma: Ooh! I love it. What if Tara has an unmatched skill at cards and wears an eye patch and has a dark, checked past and an evil twin? Ooh! I can play the evil twin. 
Mermista: Keep it simple, Tara. 
Pefuma: {giggles}
Mermista: Okay, the sooner we find the prince, the sooner we figure out where our friends are.
[Spinnerella overhears. Swift Wind and Netossa are in the camp. Netossa studies a tracker pad and Spinnerella approaches]
Spinnerella: There you are. 
Netossa: Hey, you. 
Spinnerella: Any chance I could steal you away for a moment? 
Netossa: {sighs} Not now, darling. After what happened at Elberon, we need to focus on the next move for the Rebellion. 
Spinnerella: Please? It'd only take a second. 
Netossa: I don't have the time. 
Spinnerella: Oh, yeah, sure. I understand. 
[Spinnerella hurries off. Netossa glances back.]
Netossa: Is it me, or is she....mad at me? 
Swift Wind: I don't know. It honestly doesn't seem like she's feeling much of anything. 
Netossa: {gasps} It's our anniversary! And I completely forgot. Oh, I gotta fix this, Swifty. 

{indistinct chatter}
[At a bar, a grumpy looking alien lizard guards the door. Sea Hawk and the ladies arrive. Sea Hawk steps closer.]
Sea Hawk: The dolphins roll in the tide at dawn. 
Alien Lizard: {roars}
Sea Hawk: Secret, underwater party adventure!
[Sea Hawk enters and Mermista, Perfuma, and Scorpia follow]
Mermista: Why are we in a broom closet? 
Scorpia: Yeah, where's the soiree?
Sea Hawk: Oh, this isn't the soiree. 
[He pulls a lever and they descend on an elevator]
Sea Hawk: This is the soiree.
Perfuma: {giggles} 
[He leads them into an elegant party. One guest holds a gleaming sword]
Mermista: This place is swimming with bounty hunters, pirates and sirens who would sell us out in a beat of their cold-blooded hearts. We need to blend in, and find the prince quickly and quietly. Do not ruin this for me. 
Sea Hawk: {chuckles} You don't have to tell me twice. These are my people. I just have to work the room and--{whimpers} 
Mermista: Ugh! What is it? 
Sea Hawk: Oh, no, nothing, nothing, nothing. I just didn't know, uh, he'd be here. 
[A man with an eye patch sits at a table]
Mermista: I thought these were your "people."
Sea Hawk: They are my people. Which means that most of them have sworn revenge against me at some point. 
[The man sips his drink and scowls]
Falcon: {grumbles} 
Sea Hawk: Quick! Let's, uh, go mingle.{stammers} Over there. 
Perfuma: Okay, it's game time. Tara's gonna go chat up those fellas. You go mingle with those ruffians there. Good luck, Lynda D'Ream. 
Scorpia: Oh, gosh. 
Perfuma: What a lovely shindig, huh? {chuckles} My word, that sword is very pointy. 
{blow lands}
Falcon: {grunts} 
Sea Hawk: I really hope this doesn't get in the way of rekindling...I....{stammers} Wrong word. Uh, relighting our friendship. Nope, that's--that's bad, too. Look, I'm sorry I set your boat on fire. Do you forgive me?
Falcon: {muffled grunting} 
Sea Hawk: Excellent, I'll take that as a "yes."
Mermista: Sea Hawk, focus. This cannot be like the time you ruined the Cephalopods Literary Society. 
Sea Hawk: Aw, don't worry. Now that he can't blow my cover, it's smooth sailing from here. {exclaims} 
[An alien looms]
Alien: {roars} 
[Mermista douses him with water and he falls; Scorpia joins in with a group of aliens}
{all laughing} 
Scorpia: Yeah. Totally. {sighs} So, underwater, huh? Things? Yeah, yeah, yeah... Peekablue? Anybody? No? Nobody? Okay. Well, uh...never mind. Well, good night. 
Perfuma: And that's when I told him, I don't even know how to swim. 
{all laughing} 
[Guests move away from Scorpia and Perfuma eyes her worriedly; Falcon and the Alien are tied up]
Mermista: Please tell me that's the last of your disgruntled former cohorts. 
Sea Hawk: {chuckles nervously} Uh, perhaps we should just stay back here? 
Mermista: {gasps} 
[Three menacing guests wait]
Mermista: {groans} {grunting}
{crashing noises} 
[Mermista attacks them and Sea Hawk ducks behind the bar]
Perfuma: How did it go? Did you find out anything? 
Scorpia: Yeah. I found out I'm really bad at this. {sighs} 
Perfuma: Don't say that. That--that's just the old you talking, consumed with all the self-doubt the Horde instilled in you. 
Scorpia: I'm just--I'm not really the leading-lady type. 
Perfuma: That's nonsense. You're amazing. You have the biggest heart and you could do whatever you put your mind to. 
Scorpia: Really?
Perfuma: Okay. What do you, Scorpia, like to do? 
Scorpia: Well, I always liked singing. But I'm bad. Everyone said so. Well, Catra said so, it's fine. 
Perfuma: Scorpia, you should do things not because you're good at them but because they make you happy. Follow me, okay? Repeat after me: I can do this. I can do this. 
Scorpia: Perfuma can do this. Perfuma can--
Perfuma: No, no, no. You can do this. Heh. Say "I." 
Scorpia: I--I can do this? I can do this. I can do this. I can find Prince Peekablue! 
Perfuma: Yes! That's the spirit. We'll find him, even if he's hidden in the darkest, most secluded corner of Etheria. 
Peekablue: Good evening, misfits of the sea, outlaws of the land and everyone in between. I'm your host, Prince Peekablue!
{crowd cheering}
Crowd: Peekablue! Prince! 
Scorpia: Wow, I guess I don't know what a hermit is after all. 
Peekablue: We've got a great evening of entertainment for you. Singers, dancers, and if your lucky, a little bit of Farsight for you. 
Perfuma: This is our chance. I'm gonna go get Mermista and Sea Hawk. Don't take your eyes off Peekablue. 
Peekablue: Next up, we got Swen on the piano. Give it up for Swen. 
{applause} 
[The pianist waves and begins to play]
{playing jazzy music} 
[Scorpia peeks backstage]

Netossa: How could I forget? Spinny probably has a great surprise planned and I'm going to have to plan something even better to beat her. {groans} 
[Netossa spots Spinnerella and smiles, then hides as another woman approaches Spinnerella and whispers in her ear. Netossa watches from behind a rock. When Spinnerella turns, her eyes glow.]
{voices whispering indistinctly} 
Netossa: {gasps} 
[Spinnerella looks around, then walks away.]

[In the bar, five bounty hunters are tied up with ropes.]
Mermista: {groans} Okay, anyone else? 
Sea Hawk: That's all of them. {clears throat} Now, at last, we're ready for secret, undercover and underwater party adventure! 
Mermista: {groans, then gasps} 
Sea Hawk: Mermista? What is it?
Mermista: Huh? Uh, nothing. Uh, nothing at all. 
Sea Hawk: Then why are you hiding behind the bar? 
Mermista: {groans} Fine. There might be someone here that I absolutely cannot deal with right now. 
Sea Hawk: What? Who? 
Mermista: Someone whose boat I maybe, sort of, kind of set on fire. 
Sea Hawk: What?!
Mermista: Shh! I just wanted to know what it felt like. 
Sea Hawk: {muffled} You are everything I've ever wanted. 
Mermista: Stop looking at me like that. 
{jazzy music continues} 
[Other musicians join the piano player. Scorpia creeps onstage.]
Scorpia: Psst! Hey, is that you, Peekablue? 
{music stops} 
[A spotlight shines on Scorpia]
Scorpia: {gasps} Oh...Hi...uh...I'm Sco--Lynda. D'Ream? Hello. 
Mermista: Oh, I can't watch. 
Scorpia: {chuckles} Trying to get backstage--performer--I'm a performer. 
[A microphone appears]
Scorpia: {grunting}
{feedback whines} 
Perfuma: Yay! Go, Lynda! 
Scorpia: I can do this. I can do this. {clears throat}
{feedback whines} {playing jazzy music} 
Scorpia: {singing softly} Sneak, Don't make a sound
Sneak
Just look around
{normal voice} I've always been strong
But now my nerves are gone
Cause I know I can do it
Sing, dance, be a spy
Hiding before your very eyes
How could I sneak with this fine physique?
Discover the truth
It doesn't take a sleuth
For now I'm a spy spying in disguise
Hiding before your very eyes
{singing loudly} Until you discover stay undercover
Seeking a clue that will lead me to you
Yes, I'm a spy
Spying in disguise
Hiding before your very eyes
Sneak
Don't make a sound
Sneak
Just look around
I'm a spy
I'm a spy
I'm a spy
I'm a spy
{crowd cheering}
Sea Hawk: Oh, yes! Those pipes. Bravo! 
Scorpia: Oh. {chuckles} Thank you. Thank you. {sighs} I did it. 
[The pianist darts backstage]
Scorpia: Swen? {gasps} It's you! Oh, wow, Prince Peekablue, I have been looking all over for you. 
Peekablue: That was quite a number, honey. But I really don't have time to chitchat. 
Scorpia: Okay, yeah, but see, we need your powers to fight Horde Prime see where our friends are.
Peekablue: Friends? Do you mean Glimmer and Adora? 
Scorpia: Wow, you're amazing. Come on, do it again. Can you see them right now? 
Peekablue: I can see...a bright, shiny woman among the stars with her great big sword, fighting against Horde Prime! She-Ra, in space!
Scorpia: {gasps} Wait, fighting with her sword? But Adora broke the sword. 
Peekablue: {stammers} Farsight never lies, darling. {clears throat} Now I must insist you leave. I need to get into character for my next performance. 
Scorpia: "Character"? Hmm. Strangest thing, but I think we've met before. 
[Peekablue's eyes widen and he has his back to Scorpia. She narrows her eyes and stares at him.]
Scorpia: Oh, Perfuma's flower crown workshop. 
Peekablue: Yes! Perfuma. She's a doll, isn't she? Never miss a shindig with her. {whimpers} 
Scorpia: The real Peekablue has never met Perfuma. Who are you? 
[Peekablue darts off, and Scorpia whacks him with her tail.]
{blow lands} 
Peekablue: {groans} 
[He falls. The Prince morphs to Swen, then Catra, and Flutterina. Scorpia's mouth hangs open. They morph into Bow, then Adora, and finally, Double Trouble.]
Scorpia: Double Trouble? 
[Later, Double Trouble is tied up.]
Double Trouble: {gasps} {sighs} Bravo. You caught me. Again. 
Perfuma: What are you doing here? Where's the real Peekablue? 
Double Trouble: Wouldn't know. After things ended with my cash-kitten, I needed another gig. I had heard all about the elusive Peekablue. A seer who no one has seen in years? How could I resist? 
Scorpia: So, thing whole mission has been a big waste of time. 
Double Trouble: I might not have the prince's gifts, but I know where your friends are. And I'll tell you. For a price, of course. 
[Perfuma makes a fist]
Double Trouble: Fine. While I was wandering through occupied territories, I posed as a clone, trying to get in good with Big Brother. Turns out, it wasn't for me. It makes for a very dull audience when everyone's mind-controlled. Half the crowd out there is chipped. 
Perfuma: What?
Double Trouble: That's not all. Prime is angry. She-Ra showed up and stole his little kitten away. Your friends are on their way home, but Prime set up a blockade around the planet, ready to strike down anyone daring to pass. They'll never make it. 
[Mermista appears.]

[In the forest, Netossa follows Spinnerella, then embraces her from behind.]
Netossa: Hey, you. I'm so sorry about today. I forgot all about it. 
Spinnerella: Don't worry. All is forgiven. 
Netossa: You promise you're not mad? 
Spinnerella: I could never be mad at you, beloved. 
Netossa: "Beloved"? You've never called me that before. Show me your neck! 
[Spinnerella's eyes glow]
Spinnerella: What a shame we can't be together. In Horde Prime's light. 
[Netossa backs up]
Netossa: {whimpering}
[Other Etherians with glowing eyes surround her.]
Netossa: What have you done? 

Double Trouble: Are we done here? 
{thudding}
Double Trouble: {gasps} 
[The glass cracks and water gushes in. Mermista has a chip on the back of her neck.]
Perfuma: Mermista? What are you doing? 
Mermista: Step out of the darkness and into the light of Prime. 
Sea Hawk: Mermista. Mermista, no!
[Mermista sends a wave of water and Perfuma blocks it with vines]
Scorpia: {yelling} 
[Scorpia fires a blast and knocks Mermista back into a wall. Electricity crackles.]
Perfuma: {gasps} 
Double Trouble: We are in a delicate underwater bubble. So, can you please stop hitting one another? 
Perfuma: We need to get out of here. 
[Scorpia picks up Double Trouble and they flee. The party guests surround them with glowing green eyes.}
Perfuma: {shouts}
{voices whispering indistinctly}
Scorpia: There's no way out. 
Double Trouble: I know a way out. Take me to the stage! I mean it. Take me to the stage. 
Scorpia: {grunting}
Sea Hawk: {whimpering} 

[In the forest, Netossa has barricaded herself behind a white forcefield. Spinnerella thrusts her fists forward, trying to break through with a whirlwind.]
Spinnerella: {yells} 
[The forcefield falls and Netossa falls to the ground. Spinnerella stands over her with glowing eyes]
{tree branch snaps}
Swift Wind: {whinnies}
Netossa: {gasps} 
[Swift Wind falters on the ground nearby, and Frosta falls at his feet, as Micah strives towards them, surrounded by golden light. His eyes glow green. He casts a spell and Netossa blocks it with webbing, protecting Frosta and the horse. Spinnerella joins Micah]

[In the bar, Scorpia puts Double Trouble down and battles their attackers.]
Perfuma: {yells}
Double Trouble: The theater has...um, a little help? I need to lift my hand to the heavens. The theater has many secrets. 
[Double Troubles pulls a rope and an elevator drops from the chandelier.]
Scorpia: I'll hold them off. Get on that platform and get out of here. 
Sea Hawk: That's your cue, hot stuff. Let's go! 
[Mermista appears behind Scorpia, riding on a wave of water]
Scorpia: {gaps} 
Scorpia & Mermista: {yelling} 
[Scorpia battles back]
Scorpia: Perfuma, go! 
[Scorpia holds off the attackers with electrical pulses from her claws. More water flood in.]
Perfuma: Scorpia, come on!
Scorpia: There's too many of them. And this place is coming down unless someone stops it. You have to get out and protect the others. 
[The clones wage towards her]
Scorpia: Go. Now! 
Perfuma: What? No! You're coming, too! 
Scorpia: Nah. This is why I'm here. I'm the muscle, remember? I can do this. 
[Scorpia severs Perfuma's vines and the elevator door closes. She looks up as her friends escape.]
Scorpia: {screaming} 
[Perfuma watches from the elevator, as the attackers close in around Scorpia]

[In the forest, Micah and Spinnerella spew flames and Netossa's net force field and Netossa struggles to protect Frosta and Swift Wind. She looks at Spinnerella and Spinnerella's eyes glow.]
Netossa: {grunting} I'm sorry!
[Netossa casts over their attackers]
Netossa: Run, quick!
[Frosta and Netossa hop on Swift Wind and fly into the night sky. Netossa glances back at Spinnerella.]
Netossa: Happy anniversary. 

[On Mara's ship, Entrapta pulls a wire and a tracker pad blinks.]
{chiming} 
Entrapta: Ha! A signal. We're in range. Patching us through to the Rebellion's communication line. 
Perfuma: Adora?
Adora: Perfuma. What's going on? 
Perfuma: I...I...
Adora: We're on our way back. Just hang on a little longer. We're almost there.
Perfuma: No! Don't come back. Horde Prime knows you're coming. There's a trap, a blockade. You'll never make it through. You need to stay away. The Rebellion's been compromised. Horde Prime has them. We lost. I'm so sorry, we lost them. {yelps} 
[The screen goes black and they stare at the tracker pad. Mara's ship hovers in space] 
{static crackling}
