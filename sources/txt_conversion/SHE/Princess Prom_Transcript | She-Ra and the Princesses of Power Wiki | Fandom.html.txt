Adora: Uh, hey, guys, I got an invite to the All Princess Ball, Winter Wonderland. Do you know what this is?
Bow and Glimmer: Princess Prom! Princess Prom! Princess Prom! We are going to Princess Prom!
Adora: Okay, you've gone crazy, got it. I'll just come back later.
Bow: The ball is a meeting for all the princesses of Etheria.
Glimmer: And a giant party! Dancing, food, fancy dresses.
Adora: Dancing?
Glimmer: It only happens once a decade. I've been waiting years for this!
Adora: Uh, I'm only a princess sometimes, so are you sure I should even go?
Glimmer: Of course! Every princess is invited! That includes you!
Bow: Oh yeah. It's all in the invite.
{Bow unravels a long scroll and Adora picks it up.}
Adora: Okay. "Rules for greeting the hostess. Expected curtsy depth? Proper stair descending etiquette"?
Bow: The ball has been going on for centuries. There's a lot of really old etiquette stuff you gotta do before you can party.
Glimmer: But it's gonna be so fun! And Princess Frosta is hosting it this year in the Kingdom of Snows! Her magic is incredibly powerful. She'd be a huge get for The Rebellion!
Adora: [whimpers]
Glimmer: Don't worry! I'll be with you and so will Bow since he's going as my plus one!
Bow: Uh actually--
Glimmer: Together, the three of us can handle anything. 
Bow: About that... 
Glimmer: It's the best friend squad in action! Right Bow?
Bow: I'm going with Perfuma.
Glimmer: What!?

Theme plays
Catra: I'm sick of this. Shadow Weaver failed to get Adora and if Hordak finds out she'll take us down with her. She's obsessed. We need to think big picture. It's time for someone new to take over. Me. So, you in?
Scorpia: I'm hanging out in your room! [Chuckles]
Catra: Unfortunately, you're the only one I can trust around here.
Scorpia: Because we're best friends.
Catra: Stop being so you and help me think. I have the beginning of a plan, but it's not enough. I need to capture Adora so Shadow Weaver doesn't demote me. I need to impress Hordak so he'll make me the new Shadow Weaver. How do I do both?
Scorpia: Why don't you try something at the All-Princess Ball? Every princess is gonna be there, so Adora probably will be too. Ooh! This year's theme is Winter Wonderland.
Catra: How did you get your claws on this?
Scorpia: They sent it to me. I'm a princess.
Catra: You're a princess!?
Scorpia: Yeah, you know. The Horde crash landed in my family's kingdom. We let them stay. My family gave Hordak our runestone, the Black Garnet.
Catra: You're a princess?
Scorpia: Oh man, I thought everyone knew. I mean, it's covered in Force Captain Orientation.
Catra: I'm beginning to think I shouldn't have skipped that. Okay, so you're a princess, and you're going to a princess ball.
Scorpia: Oh no. I'm not going. No. No one liked my family, even before we joined The Horde. I never really fit with the other princesses. I made them uncomfortable and they don't like that. They don't like me.
Catra: And that's exactly why you have to go! How dare they pretend they're better just because you're different! How dare they abandon people just because they don't fit into their perfect little lives!
Scorpia: Yeah!
Catra: How dare they take best friends and turn them into giant sword ladies who run off with people clearly inferior to you?
Scorpia: You're telling my whole life with your words.
Catra: It's time to show those princesses a thing or two! You're going, I'm coming as your plus one and we'll make this a night no one will ever forget!
Scorpia: Super Pal Duo is going to prom!

New scene
Bow: She asked and I said yes. I didn't think it would be a big deal.
Glimmer: It's not. It's fine. I'm just surprised. When did you two even talk about it?
Bow: Oh, she was super slick.

New scene
[grunting]
{Bow meets Perfuma on a battle field.}
Perfuma: Wanna go to the ball with me?
Bow: Okay!
{They resume fighting.}
Perfuma: [grunting]

New scene
Glimmer: That's super slick?
Bow: I thought it'd be fun. And Perfuma's cool.
Glimmer: Yeah, she's fine. But we always go to events together. We have our whole routine. We wear matching outfits, we share inside jokes and then we eat ice cream afterwards. It's our thing.
Bow: Well, there's nothing wrong with a new thing. Look,  I gotta get ready. We'll hang out with you guys there.
{Bow walks away.}
Glimmer: But I liked our old thing.
Adora: Glimmer! Good. No time to waste! [Adora takes Glimmer into her bedroom, the walls are covered with charts.] I've been studying the invite. I think advance prep will be key to success. So, I've divided the rules into base parts. Dance rules, etiquette rules, rules for greeting the hostess. [clears throat] 
{Glimmer sits.}
Adora: I then broke down the ballroom into quadrants and I'm familiarizing myself with targets. Ask me anything.
Glimmer: Princess Frosta.
Adora: Ruler of The Kingdom of Snows, it's her first time hosting the ball,  has the biggest kingdom outside of Bright Moon, neutral in the fight against the Horde. Allies with the Star Sisters who are friends with Mermista, but not Sweet Bee who is dating Peekablue as you can tell by the string. Up means friends, down means frenemies. And also, I made an obstacle course! I'm feeling good! I'm prepared for any and all possible scenarios. I am so ready for this Ball.
Glimmer: Great! What are you wearing?
Adora: I was just gonna go as She-Ra. I mean, she has better hair.
Glimmer: Well, you can't go as She-Ra. They have a strict no weapons rule. Neutral ground and all. So, you'll have to leave your sword at the door.
Adora: Ugh, how are there still more parts to this invite?
Glimmer: [Gasps] You know what this means?
Adora: That clothes aren't important and I should keep studying?
Glimmer: It's makeover time!!
{Glimmer winds Adora's hair into a bun and fastens it with a gold pin. She offers a pink dress, then fetches a purple one. When she turns around, Adora is studying the charts. Meanwhile, Catra wears a suit and Scorpia, a ball gown.}
Catra & Scorpia: [laughing]
{Bow dawns a tuxedo and removes the cummerbund.}
Bow: [laughs]
{Glimmer dresses Adora in pink and returns the gold pin to her hair. Adora removes it and uses it to tack a chart on the wall. Scorpia tries another gown. Bow meets Perfuma and gives her a necklace. She conjures a garland around his neck, then changes it to a subtle flower pin. Her takes her hand. Catra taps her foot impatiently. Scorpia poses in a black form-fitted gown. Catra smiles and extends her hand. Adora wears a red dress and Glimmer puts the pin in her hair. Later, guests approach the Kingdom of Snows.}
[Pop music plays]

New scene
{Adora checks her sword.}
Adora: You gotta be careful and don't just lean it somewhere and don't keep it with the other swords or it might get confused!
Glimmer: Adora, c'mon!
{They head inside.}
Adora: Whoa. Heh. It's big.
{The ballroom has a high ceiling.}
[Pop music plays over speakers]
Glimmer: The ball is one of our most ancient traditions. A princess' first ball is a huge rite if passage. Plus, the Kingdom of Snows is really big.
Adora: Which is why we need Frosta. If she joins us, all the other princesses are sure to follow.
{Adora squeezes her eyes shut.}
Adora: [Sighs] Here we go. 
{They approach Frosta's throne. Adora bows and Glimmer curtsies.} 
Adora: Hold for one, two and three. 
{They face the young princess.}
Adora: That's Frosta? But she's like, 10!
[crowd gasping]
Frosta: I'm eleven and three quarters.
Glimmer: Revered hostess, we come into your hall under the ancient rules of hospitality, bringing greetings from Bright Moon. And She-Ra, the legendary warrior.
[Crowd chatters]
Frosta: You are welcome in the Kingdom of Snows under the ancient rules of hospitality. Leave conflict at the door and please enjoy the ball.
Adora: Thank you your-- [Shouts] majesty. 
[The guards move them.]
Adora: Couldn't have mentioned that she was a little kid?
Glimmer: You did all that research. I assumed you knew. You know what? It's fine. There's plenty of time still to win her over. Now come on, let's rock this ball
{Glimmer raises her arm overhead, then looks around nervously.}
Adora: Oh! There's Entrapta! Heh.

New scene
{Entrapta slides down an icy pole.}
Entrapta: Adora! Glimmer! Are you here to watch the social experiment too?
Adora: Social experiment?
Entrapta: Different groups are thrown together and forced to mingle. Hierarchies form and break. It's the perfect place to observe behavior. And they have tiny food!
{Food is stuffed in her pouch.}
Entrapta: Where's Bow? I wanna show him my new recorder.
Glimmer: He's coming later.
Entrapta: Why didn't he come with you? Aren't you two friends?
Glimmer: Why would you think we're not?
Entrapta: There he is! Bow!
{Bow enters, Perfuma in his arm. Glimmer glances.}
Glimmer: They're matching. That's our best friend thing!
Entrapta: Feelings seem to be getting hurt.
Mermista: Hey, I'm here too. Don't make a big thing out of it.
{Bow and Perfuma laugh}
Glimmer: They're making up their own inside jokes? What? Is Perfuma his new best friend now?
Mermista: Not gonna get into whatever is happening there.
Entrapta: People just walking around in circles.
Mermista: Or that. Look, have you seen--?
Sea hawk: [singing] She's a beauty can't you see? She's attending this with me! She's my princess of the sea! Mermista! [Talking] Oh hey, it's my crew.
Adora: So, Sea Hawk's your plus one?
Mermista: No. He is just my ride. Okay? Just. My. Ride,
Sea Hawk: [Laughs] Of course. [Whispers] I am her plus one.
Entrapta: This is the best social experiment I've ever been to!
Mermista: Whatever. Do they have a kelp bar here?
Sea Hawk: To the buffet! Adventu-- Oh hi, Bow.
{Bow and Perfuma approach and Adora waves.}
Adora: Hey--
Glimmer: [Laughs] That's so funny, Adora! What a funny inside joke the two of us just came up with!
Perfuma: The She-Ra, Glimmer. It's great to see you.
Bow: Perfuma was just telling me about a winged horse that ate all the apples in Plumeria and then flew away. Sound familiar?
Glimmer: Sure, whatever. Isn't this fun? Adora and I are having such a great time here together, just the two of us. Right, Adora?
{Adora gobbles food from a tray.}
Bow: Okay. Uh, we're gonna go say hi to people. Wanna come?
Glimmer: No, you guys go on. We'll find you later. I wanna hear the rest of this hilarious story that Adora was just telling!
{Glimmer frowns and Adora spots Frosta.}
Adora: Oh, perfect. Frosta's alone. I'm gonna try to smooth things over with her. Coming? [Laughs] Okay, never mind. I'll be right back.

New scene
Adora: Revered hostess.
{Adora bows.}
Adora: I've come to apologize for earlier. I was so rude.
Frosta: Yes, you were. But as you're only an honorary princess, you can't be expected to know better.
Adora: Your kingdom is truly beautiful Princess Frosta. I'm honored to be here.
Frosta: Thank you. And now I expect you're going to ask me to join your Rebellion?
Adora: You know about that?
Frosta: Of course I do. Princesses talk you know.
{A server appears.}
Frosta: The snow peas and the cookies are touching. Do it right.
Adora: Princess Frosta, the Rebellion needs you. Your kingdom is the largest and most powerful. Your alliance could be the key to defeating the Horde.
Frosta: The Horde hasn't threatened us here.
Adora: Only because the Kingdom of Snows is so out of the way, it doesn't matter to Hordak right now. Joining the Rebellion is your best bet.
Frosta: The kingdom of Snows has defended itself perfectly well for thousands of years. We do not need your help or your Rebellion. Please continue to enjoy the ball.
{Frosta strides off.}

New scene
{Meanwhile, Glimmer watches Bow and Perfuma from a balcony. }
Bow: Perfuma was just telling about a winged horse that ate all the apples in Plumeria!
Glimmer: Where have you been?
Adora: I told you, winning over Frosta. Actually, scratch that, failing to win over Frosta.
{Adora turns to Glimmer.}
Adora: Are you okay? Why does it bother you so much?
Glimmer: It doesn't! Bow can hang out with whoever he wants. I just [groans] I never had that many friends, okay? It's always been just me and Bow. But now, what if he likes his new friends better than me? What if everyone does?
Adora: That's not gonna happen, Glimmer. Trust me, Bow isn't the type to leave his old friends behind and neither am...
{Adora startles as Scorpia and Catra arrive at the ball arm and arm.}
     
Adora: ...I.

New scene
{They bow before the princess.}
Adora: Revered hostess, you can't let them in. They're from the Horde.
Catra: Revered hostess, Princess Scorpia was invited as per the rules of this ball. Rules which I personally have the upmost respect for.
Adora: You do not!
Frosta: Princess Adora. The rules state clearly that all princesses and their chosen guests are welcome.
Adora: They're up to something. I can feel it. You have to--
Frosta: That's enough! You look at me and see a child, but I have worked too hard to gain respect only to throw it away just because you feel they are up to something. For centuries the All-Princess Ball has been neutral ground. I will not dishonor that legacy. Scorpia is a princess. Princesses get plus ones. They stay.
{Adora scowls.}
Adora: [grunts]
{A guard grabs her and Glimmer and removes them.}
Frosta: Teenagers.
Catra: Really, Adora? I'm shocked. We're not breaking any rules. Didn't you read the invite?
Adora: I know you're plotting something. From now until the second the ball ends, I'll be watching. Wherever the two of you go, I go.
{Catra smirks.}
Catra: Suit yourself. Have fun with following us!
Adora: [Grumbles] Glimmer, you get Scorpia, I'll take Catra.
{Adora runs swiftly through the crowd and glares as Catra takes food from a tray and pops it in her mouth. Adora peers from behind a guest and Catra drops something in a trash bin. Adora digs through the garbage and finds a note reading, "Hi Adora". She turns, and guests stare. Adora spots Entrapta on the balcony. Catra approaches her.}
[Crowd gasps]

New scene
{Meanwhile, Glimmer stands at the buffet as Scorpia gorges on food.} 
Scorpia: Mm. Mm. Wow, that is good. Oh what is-- I don't even know what's in this. What? Sir? Garcon? What's in this?
Glimmer: Bow! Wait up!
Bow: Glimmer. Hi.
Glimmer: There's something I need to tell you. I know things between us have been weird all night. So, I just wanted to say..
Bow: It's all right. I accept your--
Glimmer: I forgive you.
Bow: You forgive me? Glimmer, I'm allowed to hang out with other people.
Glimmer: B-b-but don't you see? That's how it starts! Then suddenly everyone has new friends and nobody needs me anymore. And then, I'm all alone.
Bow: What are you talking about? You have me, plus Adora and everyone who joined the Rebellion.
Glimmer: That's what I'm talking about. It used to be the two of us. And now, everything's changing. I don't want you to leave me behind.
Bow: No one is leaving you behind. I wanted to hang out with you and Adora and Perfuma tonight. But you're the one who keeps acting weird and leaving. I know change is scary, Glimmer. But that doesn't mean you get to take it out on me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to go get my cummerbund because it is freezing in here! We'll talk later, okay?
{Glimmer frowns, then whirls around to find Scorpia gone.}
Glimmer: [Gasps]

New scene
{Adora runs up the stairs and Entrapta perches on the balcony railing. Catra creeps up behind her.}
Entrapta: Princess Prom, hour two... 37 minutes...
Adora: Don't touch her!
Entrapta: [screams] 
{Catra catches her.}
Entrapta: You're right. This is a much better vantage point for my observations. Hi Adora. Have you met my new assistant? She brought snacks.
Catra: She stole my food then asked me to spy on people with her. Is this what love feels like?
{Adora glares, then takes Entrapta by the arm.}
Adora: Entrapta, she's from the Horde.
{Entrapta stares blankly.}
Adora: The people the Rebellion are fighting. The Rebellion you're a part of!
Entrapta: Oh. Well, in that case we should keep a better eye on her 'cause she just walked away.
{Adora looks around.}
Adora: [Groans]

New scene
{Bow heads out, shivering. He spots Scorpia with a red gem. She sets it on the wall and hurries off. Bow steps closer and spots smoke wafting from the gem.}
Bow: Is that a-- [Gasps] Oh no! Princess Scorpia is planting heat bombs! We have to stop her!
{The guards stare. Scorpia appears with Adora's sword.}
[Footsteps approach]
Bow: What are you doing? Let me go! Let--
{She whacks him with her tail.}

New scene
{Adora follows Catra. The lights dim.}
Frosta: It is my solemn duty as hostess to now announce, it is time for the first dance of the Ball.
[Crowd cheers]
{Adora is pushes onto the dance floor and spotlights shine down. Adora stands under a spotlight, and Catra extends her hand. Adora grimaces, then presses her hand to Catra's.}
Catra: I don't know about you, but I am having a blast.
Adora: Whatever it is you're planning, it won't work.
Catra: You sure?
{Adora twirls to Glimmer.}
Glimmer: [Sobs] I got into a fight with Bow and he won't wanna be friends with me anymore and I don't know where Scorpia is!
Adora: What? Glimmer don't--
Perfuma: Have you seen Bow? He went to get his cummerbund, but that was a while ago, right about the same time that Horde princess left.
Adora: Wait, do you mean Scorpia?
Adora: Glimmer, when did you last see Bow?
Glimmer: A while ago. Isn't he with Perfuma?
Adora: No. Perfuma says he's been gone this entire time.
{Catra returns.}
Catra: Maybe my plan won't work. But then again, maybe it already has.
{She dips Adora.}
Catra: Say, where's your friend, Bow?
{Adora flies and Catra and knocks her to the ground.}
Adora: [Shouts] What did you do to him!?
Catra: [Laughs] Nothing permanent.
{She hoists Catra by her suit jacket.}
Adora: Tell me what you did with him right--
{Adora is trapped in ice and Frosta glares.}
Adora: [Grunting] Revered hostess, she's got--
Frosta: Princess Ball is a ceremony of unity. Violence is strictly forbidden.
Adora: You don't understand.
Frosta: I understand perfectly. As hostess, in accordance with the rules set down over the centuries, I hereby revoke your invitation. You are to leave my kingdom and never, ever--
[Crowd gasps and shouts]
{Heat bombs explode on the walls and guests scatter.}
Frosta: Remain calm! Stop!
{Guards escort Frosta.}
Adora: Glimmer! Catra has Bow. You have to find him now!
{Glimmer teleports.}
Adora: Catra. What did you do?
Catra: I did nothing. Scorpia, Lonnie and Kyle on the other hand were very busy. It was fun distracting you though.
Adora: This isn't a game! People are gonna get hurt!
Catra: It's never been a game to me. I'm after something bigger, and no one is going to stop me.
{A pillar of ice crashes onto Adora's ice cage and Catra flees. Adora frees herself and Glimmer appears outside.}
Adora: [Grunting]

New scene
Glimmer: Bow? Bow! Where are you? [Gasps]
{Lonnie and Kyle drag him off.}
Glimmer: Get away from him! 
{She fends off the Horde soldiers and turns Bow over. He's unconscious.}
Glimmer: No!
{Scorpia knocks her out with her tail.}

New scene
{Frosta runs through the crumbling castle with her guards. She stops in front of a crystal overhead radiating light. Frosta extends her arms to the crystal and shuts her eyes. Beams of blue light radiate from the points of the crystal and the castle begins to repair itself. Chunks of ice meld together. Adora chases Catra down a hallway and they reach a dead end.}
Adora: Ha. Trapped.
Catra: You wish. [Grunts]
{Catra hops on a floating chunk of ice and rises. Adora fixes her with a steely glare and leaps on another chunk of ice. They ascend to an icy cliff and Catra hurls Adora to the ground. Adora lunges and Catra steps out of the way. She kicks Adora in the back and stands on the edge of the cliff as the castle comes back together. Adora leaps and Catra ducks out of the way. She attacks Adora with her elbow and Adora moves aside. Catra flies of the edge, wide-eyed. Adora grabs her. The castle jostles them. They fall off the side and plummet through the air. Adora removes her hair pin and sticks it through the ice. She grabs Catra's hand. They dangle from the side.}
Adora: [Grunts]
[Grunting and shouting]
[Both screaming]
Adora: Hang on! I can get us out of this!
Catra: Oh, Adora. I don't want you to.
{Catra lets go.}
Adora: [Gasps] Catra! [Gasps]
{Moments later, a Horde ship appears in the clouds. Catra and her crew have Bow and Glimmer. Catra puts her arm around them.}
Catra: [Laughs] See you later, princess.
{They fly away as Adora dangles from the icy cliff.}
Adora: [Sobbing]
[Credits roll]
