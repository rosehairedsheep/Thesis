Glimmer: {cheers} Oh! I missed this.
Catra: Really? 'Cause I could stand to never do it again. 
[Wrong Hordak looks at the sun]
Wrong Hordak: {gasps} This place is a true blessing. What is this tingling sensation? 
Bow: That's warmth, buddy. Welcome to a living planet. 
Adora: Hey, I think you guys should take a look at this. 
[Glimmer peers through bushes and spots the camp]
Glimmer: {gasps} No. Where is everyone? 
Adora: There was a fight. 
Entrapta: Makes sense. Perfuma said the Rebellion was compromised. If someone in camp got chipped and went after the rest, it would've been chaos. 
[They hurry into camp. Adora finds a helmet on the ground and picks it up.]
Bow: Adora, what if--? What if there's no one left? 
Adora: We don't know that. They might have just moved camp. Wherever they are, we need to find them. 
Glimmer: Maybe they went back to Bright Moon? Or maybe my dad took them to hide out in Mystacor? 
Catra: We can't just traipse into your old hangouts and play nice with your pals. We don't know who's chipped. 
Glimmer: Wow, you don't trust the Princesses? I am shocked. 
Entrapta: Really? That seems very in character for her. 
Adora: Catra's right. We should gather intel first so we don't fall into a trap. 
Bow: Erelandia is the closest village to camp. Maybe someone there knows what happened. 
Glimmer: I'm on it.
Bow & Adora: {yelp} 
[Glimmer teleports them.]
Catra: How about a warning next time? 
Glimmer: {chuckles} Sorry. Welcome to...
[Horde clones guard the village.]
Glimmer: Erelandia. 
[Prime's ships hover overhead.]
(Theme Song)
[On Horde Prime's ship, Prime watches footage of battles on a screen.]
{protestors shouting}
Horde Prime: How many now? 
Clone: At least a dozen occupied planets. We are stamping out the dissidents, but their message is spreading. They say they are revolting against the Horde in the name of...the Rebellion...and...of She-Ra. 
[A clone glares]
Horde Prime: My heart aches for these misguided children. Now more than ever, I am assured of my plan to use the Heart of Etheria to bring peace to all the universe. But without She-Ra, we must find another way to activate it. Find the dissenters and make an example of them. It is time to crush this spark of rebellion for good. Send word to our dear sister on Etheria. 
[An Image of Spinnerella appears on the screen]

[Adora dawns a cloak]
Adora: The townspeople might be able to tell us what happened to the Rebellion, but we need to keep a low profile. We should be able to avoid detection as long as we stick with Wrong Hordak. Let's go. 
[Wrong Hordak leads them across a bridge towards the village. Horde guards are standing outside the front gates and Adora, Glimmer, Catra, Bow, and Entrapta all wear capes and hoods.]
Wrong Hordak: Brother, uh, I hope you, too, are full only of love for Horde Prime and have no crippling doubt eating at your soul. 
[They sneak through the gate]
Clone: Glory be to Horde Prime. 
Wrong Hordak: Ah...
[Wrong Hordak hurries after them.] 
Entrapta: Nice job, Wrong Hordak. You blend right in. 
Wrong Hordak: You appear to have a facial tic. Is it cause for concern?
Entrapta: Huh? Oh, I'm winking. It signals unspoken intent behind my words. In this case, our mutual deception of the Horde. Now you try. 
Wrong Hordak: Oh, expressing facial emotion is a privilege reserved only for Prime. 
Entrapta: Which is exactly why you should do it. 
Wrong Hordak: {grunting} Oh. {giggles} 
Entrapta: Now you've got it. 
[A creature with a mustache and mushroom like head approaches] 
Mushroom Man: {yelps} 
Adora: Oh, there's a local. I'm gonna go talk to him. Um, hi there. I was just wondering if--
Mushroom Man: I don't know anything. Please, just let me go. I was just trying to get home. 
Adora: We're not going to hurt you. We just--
Mushroom Man: {whimpers} Glory be to Horde Prime. Glory be to Horde Prime. {yelps}
[Melog trips him] 
Mushroom Man: {whimpers} 
Catra: Hmm. No chip. But something is making the locals real skittish. 
Glimmer: You think? 
Catra: If these people are scared, they're more likely to sell us out to Prime than tell us anything useful. 
{locals whispering} 
Catra: We should just go. 
Adora: Not until we find out if there's any sign of the Princesses here. 
Bow: Leave this to me. You may all have magical powers and alien pets, but what we need now is the team's resident regular guy. They'll talk to me. Hey there. I'm just your average traveler passing through. Would you mind if I asked you a few questions about your lovely town?
[Bow and Wrong Hordak sparkle.]
Townsperson: Uh...what is it you want to know? 
Bow: Have you seen any Princesses around these parts?
Townsperson: Princesses? Where?
Bow: {yelps, then grunts} So, obviously, at least some of our friends were here recently and made an...impression. 
Catra: A town that hates Princesses? Should I buy property here? Is what I would of said before I joined you. Go, team. 
Adora: We should split up and look around. Whoever it was could still be close. Catra, you take Entrapta and Melog. Keep them safe, okay? 
Melog: {purrs} 
Adora: Let's move out. 
[They head in opposite directions.]
Bow: After everything the Rebellion's done for Etheria, how could people be afraid of the Princesses? 
Adora: We've been gone a while, Bow. Things are worse here than when we left. You can't blame people for being scared of...
{whispers}
Mushroom Man: ...suspicious dissenters. They're over there. 
[The Mushroom Man talks to clones.]
Adora: them...Cover for us, okay?
Wrong Hordak: Yes, brother.
Adora: Did you just--? Did you just wind at me? 
Wrong Hordak: Brothers! There is nothing to see here. Please move along. 
Clones: Glory be to Horde Prime. 
Shopkeeper: Oh, no. I don't want any part of this. You're wearing hooded cloaks. It's highly suspicious. Are you hiding form the Horde? I'll call for help. 
Bow: No need for that. We're just, uh...browsing. 
[The Shopkeeper glares. Adora and Glimmer look at a vest.]
Bow: So...it seems like things have been pretty bad around here lately. 
Shopkeeper: Things are bad everywhere. We're all just trying to get through the day without any trouble. 
Bow: So, what, you're all just giving up and letting Prime take over? 
Shopkeeper: Well, what else are we supposed to do?
Adora: Bow, be cool. Undercover, remember?
Bow: Well, I'm just a completely objective third-party observer. But Erelandia should join the Rebellion and fight back. 
Adora: Oh, yeah. That's nice. 
Shopkeeper: {scoffs} The Rebellion? The Rebellion is on the Horde's side now. If it's not clones attacking us, it's Princesses. 
Glimmer: No. No, it's not their fault. It's Prime's chips controlling them--
Shopkeeper: Do you think that makes a difference to us? 
Glimmer: Well, there are still some Princesses fighting for Etheria. 
Adora: Okay, well, there she is. 
Shopkeeper: {gasps} Queen Glimmer, I--I--I'm sorry. Please, I don't want any trouble. 
Bow: We're not with the Horde. 
Wrong Hordak: Someone is coming, brothers. Ah?
Adora: That's not how winking works. Is someone coming or not? {screams}
[The wall shatters and Spinnerella appears. Her eyes glow green. Adora scowls.]

[Catra and Melog perch in a tree.]
Entrapta: Once I get these samples analyzed, we'll know if the Princesses were here in approximately four to six weeks. 
Spinnerella: {grunts}
Catra: {gasps} 
[Catra eyes a purple whirlwind.]
Catra: Found them. 
Bow, Glimmer, & Adora: {yelling}
[Bow, Glimmer and Adora spin in a purple tornado as Spinnerella holds her arms out, controlling the wind.]
Entrapta: That's the windy one, right? Isn't she with us? 
Catra: Not anymore. 
Adora: Spinnerella, this isn't you. You have to fight the chip. 
Spinnerella: My fight is over. Lord Prime has given me peace. It's time for you to join us. 
Glimmer: Not...today. 
[They join hands and teleport off.] 
Spinnerella: {grunts} 
{all scream} 
[They land by Catra.]
Adora: Prime really did it. How--? How are we supposed to fight our own friends?
Catra: It never stopped you before. 
[Spinnerella returns and cocks her fists. Netossa casts a net to shield them from her wind.]
Netossa: Hey, guys, welcome back. 
[Spinerella is knocked back.]
Spinnerella: Hello, beloved. 
Netossa: {growls} 
[They battle. Netossa is knocked down.]
Spinnerella: {screams} 
[Spinnerella flies up, then lands as Netossa scurries off.]
Netossa: {yelps} 
[Spinnerella conjures a tornado with chunks of wood.]
Netossa: Spinny, don't. 
Glimmer: We've gotta go. 
Netossa: No. Wait! 
[Glimmer teleports Netossa away.]

[Aboard Horde Prime's ship, the Hordak Clone walks across a hallway. He gazes at the purple diamond shaped piece of tech from Entrapta. Horde Prime appears behind him.]
Horde Prime: Brother? 
Hordak: Yes, Lord Prime?
Horde Prime: Come with me. 
[He follows.]
Horde Prime: {sighs} There is something I am forgetting. It plays at the edges of my mind. Etheria. Long ago, I heard that name before, though it fell on different ears. Prepare the vessel. I must access the memories stored in this version. 
[The clone types on a keyboard in front of a tank, containing an ancient clone suspended in green liquid. Prime plugs into the tank and closes his eyes.]
Horde Prime: The First Ones sought a new source of power of ancient worlds. Why? Why bend themselves to the whims of magic and myth? 
[The Hordak clone closes his eyes and has a flashback. He recalls the Fright Zone and his throne. He opens his eyes and gazes at Horde Prime scanning the tank. Hordak remembers his lab and Entrapta.]
Hordak: {gasps} 
Horde Prime: The fools took their secrets with them when they died. But I will find another way. Is there something wrong, little brother? 
Hordak: It is an honor to bask in the glory of your former selves, Lord Prime.
[Prime walks away]

[In Etheria, Glimmer and Netossa join the others in the forest.]
Netossa: What were you thinking? 
Bow: Netossa, I'm so glad you're okay. 
Netossa: Why'd you do that? I've been tracking Spinny for days. I almost had her. 
Catra: Looked more like she almost had you. 
Netossa: Catra? Stand back. I'll handle this one. 
Catra: What one? {yelps} 
[She traps Catra in a net and Melog morphs into a beast.] 
Melog: {roars}
Adora: Netossa, it's a long story, but she's with us now. 
Netossa: Really? 
Catra: {hisses} 
Adora: Yeah. 
[Netossa removes the net and Catra flops on the ground.]
Catra: {grunts} 
Netossa: Watch out, a clone!
Wrong Hordak: Uh...
Adora: He's, uh---he's actually on our side, too. 
Netossa: So, the only person I'm fighting here is...my own wife? 
Adora: Netossa, what happened to everyone else? 
Netossa: They got Spinny first. And she got to the others. She chipped them. Mermista, Scorpia...King Micah. Prime is forcing them to attack the people of Etheria, to attack us. The other Princesses are in hiding, trying to figure out what to do next, but I can't wait for them. All I know is, I have to get Spinnerella back. Whatever it takes. 
Bow: We were gone. We weren't here to help our friends. And the people we were supposed to be fighting for have lost all hope in us. 
Adora: Horde Prime tore our home apart. He took our friends. He's not gonna stop until he's taken everything from us. 
[There are tears in Adora's eyes. Netossa hangs her head and Entrapta and Wrong Hordak frown. Catra and Melog look down sadly and tears drip from Glimmer's eyes.]
Glimmer: Netossa...I'm sorry. We should've been there. But we're here now and we're not giving up. We've never faced greater odds than this. But for everything Prime has thrown at us, he still hasn't managed to stop us. 
[The others look at her and smile.]
Glimmer: We're going back for Spinnerella and for the people of Erelandia and to show Prime that Etheria's not done fighting yet. We'll need everyone's help to pull this off. So?
Adora: We won't let Prime win this one. 
Entrapta: I'm in. 
Wrong Hordak: I am honored to fight beside you, brothers. 
Catra: Sure. Why not? I have some experience taking out Princesses. 
[They join their hands together. Netossa smiles.]
Netossa: Thank you. 
[They teleport off.] 

[In Erelandia, Spinnerella has the shopkeeper trapped in a whirlwind.]
Shopkeeper: I swear I wasn't helping She-Ra. I didn't even know it was her. 
Spinnerella: Prime rewards honesty from his children. Tell us where she is and you will be absolved. 
Wrong Hordak: The rebels have been sighted in the outskirts of the woods. Come at once. 
[Two clones follow Wrong Hordak out of the town gates.]
Clone: Where are the rebels? 
Wrong Hordak: Right beside you. Ah? 
Clones: {gasp} 
[Glimmer pounces.]
Glimmer: {yells}
[In the village, Bow hits Horde ships with arrows and they crash in front of the Mushroom Man, downing two clones.]
Glimmer: Gotcha. 
Catra: You're clear. 
[Glimmer teleports the Mushroom Man and Catra, Adora, and Netossa race forward. Catra downs a clone.]
Catra: You go deal with Spinnerella. We'll take care of the bots. 
Adora: Be careful. 
Catra: Always am. 
Shopkeeper: Please, I have nothing to do with her. You have to believe me. 
Adora: The shopkeeper. No wonder she didn't trust us. 
[Netossa stares at Spinnerella.]
Netossa: Adora, what if...she can't come back from this? 
Adora: She's still in there. She needs you to remind her who she is. And we need to remind Prime who we are. For the honor of Grayskull!
[A sword appears and Adora grips it. Light beams from the blade and surrounds her in a shimmery glow. The golden light runs up Adora's legs and winged boots cover her feet. As she transforms into She-Ra, she wears a white and gold uniform and a golden crown surrounds her flowing long hair. She-Ra raises the sword overhead and a burst of golden light circles around her. She stands on the ground and Netossa is wide-eyed.]
Netossa: {whistles} New look? 
[She-Ra glances back with a grin.]
Netossa: Spinnerella! 
Spinnerella: Welcome back, beloved. 
Shopkeeper: {screams}
[Glimmer teleports the shopkeeper.] 
Shopkeeper: Queen Glimmer? 
Glimmer: We won't abandon Erelandia. 
[Glimmer teleports away, leaving the villagers safe in the forest. In Erelandia, Spinnerella flies at She-Ra and Netossa.]
Spinnerella: {yelling} 
[She knocks them to either side and Netossa collapses on the ground. Spinnerella flies up and leaps at her. Netossa shields herself with a net and Spinnerella presses on it.]
She-Ra: {gasps} 
[She-Ra swings her sword, sending waves of light at Spinnerella.]
Netossa: What are you doing? 
She-Ra: I'm trying not to hurt her. 
Netossa: Stop holding back. She won't. 
[Spinnerella glares at She-Ra and conjures a strong wind. She pelts She-Ra with rocks. She-Ra stops herself with her sword. The sword glows.]
She-Ra: {yells} 
[She strikes the ground and Spinnerella flies into a wall and crashes to the ground.]
Netossa: That's more like it. 
[Netossa traps her in a net.]
Netossa: Spinny, stop. It's me, Netossa. Please. I love you. Come back to me. 
[Her eyes return to normal.]
Spinnerella: Netossa? 
Netossa: Spinny! Is that you?  
Spinnerella: Darling.  
Netossa: No!  
Spinnerella: {yelling} 
[The chip in her neck glows green and Spinnerella grabs her head. She disappears in a swirl of purple wind.] 
Spinnerella: {screams}  
[She-Ra crouches to Netossa and grips her shoulders.] 
Netossa: She's still in there. I saw her. We can get her back, I know it.  
Shopkeeper: {screams} Huh?  
[The villages return and cheer.] 
{locals cheering}  
Netossa: It's good to have you guys back.  
Catra: She'll, um...She'll be okay. Spinnerella. After the chip, I mean. I, uh, have some experience.  
Shopkeeper: Princesses.  
Bow: Well, technically, I'm not actually-- 
Shopkeeper: I still think you sort are trouble, but thank you for freeing our town. I don't know what we can do, but if the Rebellion ever needs it, you can always find a friendly face in Erelandia.  
[Bow and Glimmer embrace the Shopkeeper.] 
Shopkeeper: Oh! Ah.  
[She-Ra raises her sword to the sky. A Horde emblem is blasted away and is replaced with the image of She-Ra's sword.] 
Catra: I think Horde Prime is going to know She-Ra's back.  
She-Ra: Good.   
Horde Prime: {growls} 
[He punches a screen.] 
Horde Prime: Set coordinates for Etheria. Clearly, I am going to have to handle this embarrassment myself.  
[Hordak opens his clenched palm and eyes the glowing tech.]  
[In Etheria, Netossa leads her friends through the forest.] 
Glimmer: {gasps}  
[They reach a cave.] 
Glimmer: This is where the Rebellion is hiding out?  
Netossa: Yep. Why? Have you been here?  
Bow: {laughs} Oh, I can't wait to see every-- {yells}  
[Vines trap them. Perfuma appears.] 
Perfuma: Show us your necks!  
Netossa: Perfuma, they're good.  
Pefuma: Your necks! 
Frosta: She's clear.  
[Frosta gives and thumbs up and Perfuma inspects Bow. ] 
Bow: {grunts} 
Perfuma: Oh, Bow! Bow, it's really you!  
Frosta: Ah, Glimmer! 
Glimmer: Frosta!  
[Swift Wind joins them.] 
Swift Wind: {neighs}  
She-Ra: Swift Wind!  
Swift Wind: {neighs}  
[He nuzzles She-Ra.] 
Entrapta: Emily! Wrong Hordak, meet Emily.  
Wrong Hordak: {whimpering}  
[Entrapta grabs his hand and places it on the little round robot.] 
Wrong Hordak: {gasps}  
Perfuma: {sobbing} 
Bow: All right, let--let it out.  
Perfuma: I don't wanna be in change anymore!  
[Catra and Melog watch from the outskirts and She-Ra spots them.] 
She-Ra: Hey, come here. It's time for you to officially meet everyone.  
Catra: You sure?  
[Frosta punches Catra with an icy fist.]  
Catra: Are you serious?  
Frosta: Deadly serious, Horde scum.  
She-Ra: Frosta! It's--it's a long story, but Catra's with us now. Okay?  
Frosta: {grunts} Fine. But I still don't like her face.  
She-Ra: She can live with that.  
Perfuma: Did you find her?  
Netossa: I did, but... 
She-Ra: Spinnerella got away, but we'll get her back. We'll get all of our friends back. There's still a chance to save them. This war has only just begun.
