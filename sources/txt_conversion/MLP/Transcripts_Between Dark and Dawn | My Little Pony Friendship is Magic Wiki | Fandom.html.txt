[stomping]
Twilight Sparkle: Remind me how this happened again!
[crunch]
Applejack: And why there's a giant turtle eatin' my family's entire summer crop!
Fluttershy: Oh, dear. Mr. Tortoise-Snap said he was hungry. But he promised me he would only take a few small bites.
Rainbow Dash: I don't think that thing knows what "small" is.
Mr. Tortoise-Snap: [gulps]
[stomping]
Spike: Aah!
Rarity: Spikey-Wikey!
Spike: Whoa!
Mr. Tortoise-Snap: [chomps]
Twilight Sparkle: Applejack and Pinkie, you distract him! Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Fluttershy, let's save Spike!
Applejack: [grunting]
[whirring]
Mr. Tortoise-Snap: [low growl]
[snap!]
Fluttershy: Mr. Tortoise-Snap, I'm only asking nicely once! Let my friend go!
Mr. Tortoise-Snap: [low growl]
Spike: Whoa! Whoa!
Twilight Sparkle: And now, a simple teleportation spell should—
Princess Celestia: Halt, interloper!
Princess Luna: Stay back, friends! My sister and I will take care of the beast!
[magic zaps]
Rainbow Dash: All the times we've actually needed their help, and they show up for this?
[whooshing]
[teleportation zap]
Twilight Sparkle: That's just what I was about to do!
Princess Luna: [laughs] Goodness, sister! That was fun!
Princess Celestia: No need to thank us. To be honest, we've recently realized we like being part of the action.
Princess Luna: Experiencing life instead of just dreaming about it.
Princess Celestia: And making a difference outside the throne room.
Princess Celestia and Princess Luna: [laughing]
Applejack: Y'all think they're gonna be doin' this a lot?
[theme song]
[crunch]
[splash]
Fluttershy: Oh, my. We'd better ask somepony to fix that hole. It seems very dangerous.
Princess Luna: Which is why we're here!
[whoosh]
[thud]
[ponies cheering]
Rainbow Dash: [growls] I can't read this thing. How am I supposed to lead a Filly Guides hike if the map makes us more lost?
Princess Celestia: Did somepony say "lost"?
Princess Luna: Not for long! [laughs]
[zap!]
Pinkie Pie: [slurps]
Mrs. Cake: Oh, now, this is just terrible! Miss Cheerilee ordered cupcakes for school today, and I forgot to make the order!
Pinkie Pie: Ah, no biggie. We could—
[crash!]
Princess Celestia: Students going hungry? Not on our watch!
Princess Luna: Let us bake, sister!
Pinkie Pie: [gasps]
[splattering]
Applejack: And then they carried Granny Smith across the street. There wasn't even any traffic!
Fluttershy: It's not that we don't appreciate their help.
Rarity: But suddenly, Celestia and Luna seem to think we can't do anything on our own.
Rainbow Dash: How are we supposed to learn to be rulers of Equestria with them fixing every teensy problem for us?
Twilight Sparkle: Maybe the princesses changed their minds. Maybe they don't think we're up to the responsibility of protecting Equestria after all!
Spike: Or maybe this week's just a one-time thing that'll never happen again.
[doors open]
Princess Celestia: Ah! A strategy meeting! What is the danger this time? A rampaging beast? Evil spell? Friendship problem?
Princess Luna: We're ready to do whatever we can.
Twilight Sparkle: Great. But is something wrong? It's just... You've been helping us an awful lot, and we know you have way more important ruler-y things to do, so...
Princess Luna: We've spent more than enough time in the throne room. Real life is happening out here.
Twilight Sparkle: Wait. That's what this is about? You're sick of being princesses?
Princess Celestia: Not exactly. Battling the Everfree Forest alongside Star Swirl made us realize what we've missed out on. So, instead of spending the day ruling...
Princess Luna: ...and the night patrolling dreams...
Princess Celestia: ...we wanted a chance to do the things you do. Save the day! Adventure with friends! Shampoo anteaters.
Spike: I'm pretty sure Fluttershy's the only pony that does that.
Rainbow Dash: Well, there are waaaay more fun things to do than follow us around.
Pinkie Pie: Ooh! You should make a list of all the stuff you never tried but always wanted to! There's a lotta little things out there to do!
Princess Celestia: What an intriguing idea. Only... it's much harder to justify a vacation from the castle when it's not an emergency we're responding to.
Twilight Sparkle: Don't worry. We'll cover your palace duties. It'll be a good chance for us to practice for when you retire.
Princess Luna: Well, if you're sure you don't mind the extra effort.
Twilight Sparkle: [scoffs]
Princess Celestia: Thank you, Twilight! What a relief to know the Royal Swanifying Ceremony is in good hooves. [laughs]
Applejack: The what now?
Princess Celestia: "Fun Not Yet Had". [squeals] I can't wait to start planning our time off!
Princess Luna: The chance to do whatever we want! And you know what that means!



Princess Celestia:
Adventure!


Princess Luna:
Relaxation!

Princess Luna: Well, it's just that I... I spend each night in everypony's intense dreams. So I could use some real-world downtime.
Princess Celestia: [sighs] I understand. But for me, every day is real-world. Meetings and decrees and meetings about decrees and decrees about the meetings... I crave excitement!
Princess Luna: Uh, I'm not sure how we can both be happy. Unless...
Princess Celestia: [gasps] We take turns doing what we like!
Princess Celestia and Princess Luna: Sister trip!
Princess Luna: And I have the perfect accessories for us to wear! Wait right here!
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zap]
Princess Celestia: Oh. [nervous laugh] We'll be... twin-sies.
Princess Luna: [giggling] Just like regular pony tourists. I knew you'd love it.
Princess Celestia: I have a few things for us, too.
[thud]
Princess Celestia: Sunglasses, bug spray, ice boots, hoof sanitizer, and travel snacks!
Princess Luna: [slurps, chews, coughs]
Princess Celestia: You have to add water. What do you think?
Princess Luna: It's perfect, sister.
Princess Celestia: And here are instructions of how to prepare for the Royal Swanifying.
Twilight Sparkle: If it's written down, I'm sure we can handle it. Have fun!
Princess Luna: One more thing. We're leaving you in charge of raising the sun and moon while we're gone.
Twilight Sparkle and Spike: [gasp]
Twilight Sparkle: [nervous laugh]
Princess Celestia: We have put a small part of our power in this amulet. You can activate it with your magic at any time. Preferably dawn and dusk.
Pinkie Pie: Ooh! That's not a terrifying level of responsibility or anything!
Twilight Sparkle: We won't let you down, princesses. [to Spike] Please tell me that scroll says what the the Royal Swanifying is.
Spike: Apparently it's a celebration of all the swans in the royal lake. We round them up, parade them through the streets, and finish with a party in the castle.
[swan squawks]
Rainbow Dash: One question. Why?!
Twilight Sparkle: It doesn't matter. This is our chance to show Celestia and Luna we'll do whatever the job requires. If they can take care of all this themselves, then I know we can. Together.
Fluttershy: Um... hmm.
Rarity: Ah. Jolly good.
Spike: You're definitely not reading the same scroll I am.
Princess Celestia: Remember, sister. From now on, we are regular, carefree ponies!
[excited chattering]
[camera clicks]
Princess Luna: We're leaving the princess life behind, and we're not even going to fly!
Princess Celestia: Of course. [laughs] How new and different. It's just like Pinkie Pie said.
[Princess Celestia]
There's a lotta little things you gotta do in this world
[Princess Luna]
There's a lotta little things you gotta try
[Princess Celestia]
Just a pack of punchy plunges other ponies all take
[Princess Luna]
That have princess-pony-passed us right by
[Both]
Nopony knows you like your little sister
Nopony is a better confidante
Nopony is truer than the one you are
Nopony else here I could want
[Princess Celestia]
You can't saunter on a sojourn hid behind castle walls
[Princess Luna]
You can't throw a throne down on the beach
[Princess Celestia]
So we're gonna be absconding
[Princess Luna]
To a little vagabonding
[Princess Celestia]
And this bucket list is gonna be a peach
[Both]
Nopony knows you like your older sister
Nopony is a better confidante
Nopony is truer than the one you are
Nopony else here I could want
There's a lotta little things you gotta try in this world
There's a lotta little things you gotta see
[Princess Luna]
But just reading by a river and resting our hooves
Would practically be perfect for me
[Both]
Nopony knows you like your sister
Nopony is a better confidante
Nopony is truer than the one you are
Nopony else here I could want
[Princess Celestia]
You can't venture on adventures if you're taking a nap
You can't check things off your checklist while you sleep
So let's take another hill
[Princess Luna]
Sometimes you can be a pill
And why's the way ahead always so steep?
[doors open]
Fancy Pants: Princesses, we are here to... Oh.
Applejack: Uh, we're fillin' in for Their Majesties. What can we help y'all with?
Fancy Pants: I say. How irregular. Well then. We offer our assistance as heads of the Royal Swanifying Committee.
Rarity: Ah, what a relief.
Twilight Sparkle: Thank you, but we have it all covered.
Fancy Pants: Reeeeeally? Well, good luck with that.
Twilight Sparkle: If we ask for help, it's just like admitting we're not as good at the job as Luna and Celestia are. Besides, how hard can throwing a swan party be?
Pinkie Pie: Yeah! All we have left to do is polish the armor, bubble the punch, glitter the carpet, puff the pastry, float the floats, and carpet every road in Canterlot! Should I keep reading?
Twilight Sparkle: [nervous laugh]
Princess Luna: Uh, Celestia? Since we're both a little tired, m-maybe the first thing we do shouldn't be too wild.
Princess Celestia: Exactly what I was thinking.
Princess Celestia: ziiiiip liiiiiiiiiine!
Princess Celestia: Now, every time we have tea, we can remember this magical day!
Princess Luna: Well, I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. But now, we're going to do something I've always wanted to do but never could because of my night shift.
Princess Celestia: Is it another zip line?
Princess Luna: No.
Princess Luna: It's the post office!
Princess Celestia: It is indeed.
Princess Luna: Just think! All the mail in Ponyville goes through here! Isn't that amazing?!
[thump]
Princess Luna: One stamp, please!
[clattering]
Princess Luna: [licks] Wait for it...
[watch ticking]
[door opens]
Princess Celestia: You didn't need a stamp if you were just going to give this to me.
Princess Luna: Yes, but I didn't give it to you. A mailpony took it from me, searched to find who it was meant for, and gave it to you! It's about the process!
Princess Celestia: [echoing] Did you know that nopony has ever explored the bottom of these caverns?
[roaring]
[rocks crunching]
Princess Luna: [flatly] I wonder why.
Princess Luna: I have always wanted to try this!
[technopop]
Princess Luna: Isn't this wonderful, sister?
[Princess Celestia]
There's a lotta little things you gotta do in this world
[Princess Luna]
There's a lotta little things you ought to view
[Princess Celestia]
And our little lotta list may be a little bit long
[Princess Luna]
[sighs] And might take a lotta bother to do
[Both]
But I'm sure it gets better later on
[Princess Celestia]
And after darkest night's a new dawn
[Princess Luna]
It's my turn to do the choosing
[Princess Celestia]
After river rapid cruising
[Both]
This adventure isn't too fun to be on
[inflating sounds]
[doors open]
Fancy Pants: Princess Twilight! It has come to our attention that you don't intend to serve watercress at the Royal Swanifying Ceremony.
Twilight Sparkle: There's not enough in the castle kitchens to—
Fancy Pants: Don't tell me. Tell him.
[swan squawks]
Fancy Pants: And you must do something about the garbage piling up outside. The street sweepers are on strike, and the royal carpeters can't do their jobs.
Applejack: Did you even know there were royal street carpeters?
Fancy Pants: Oh, dear. I do hope those aren't the final decorations for the gala.
Rarity: How rude.
Twilight Sparkle: Thank you for your constructive criticism. But we really don't have time to chat, so...
[doors close]
Princess Celestia: [chewing, gulps] Well, I hope you're enjoying yourself on your super-relaxing picnic, sister.
Princess Luna: I would be if you hadn't made us hike through a million prickle bushes! [groans]
Princess Celestia: Well, they hurt less than that horrible howling you dragged us to.
Princess Luna: That was Ponygliacci, and it's an opera! And you made us leave early, even though it was still my turn.
Princess Celestia: Oh, just face it, Luna. You are never happy!
Princess Luna: Because you don't want me to be happy. I always have to do things your way. I bet you wish I'd never come back so you could still rule day and night!
Princess Celestia: You think I like that kind of pressure?! Being responsible for every little thing in Equestria and you?! What I'd like is a [booming] sister I can depend on!
Princess Luna: [booming] You mean boss around!
Princess Celestia: [booming] Calm down, Luna!
Princess Luna: No! And don't you dare use your Canterlot Voice on me! I think this adventure would be better if I did it by myself!
Princess Celestia: Fine! I just remembered something I forgot I always wanted to do. Be alone!
Princess Luna: [tearing up] Guess we have the same thing on both of our lists then.
Applejack: Pinkie! You got those appetizers yet?!
Pinkie Pie: Still mashing the guacamole!
Spike: [yelping]
Rarity: So we're just going to have to do with sequins!
Fluttershy: Um, sorry for the bad news, but the courtyard is full of swans waiting to get in!
[swans squawking]
Rainbow Dash: And we're nowhere near ready!
Twilight Sparkle: How does Celestia and Luna rule a kingdom and get all this done by themselves every year?!
Fancy Pants: [laughs] Oh, how droll.
Spike: Uh, what's the funny part exactly?
Fancy Pants: The princesses never do all the ceremony planning by themselves.
Twilight Sparkle: They don't?
Fancy Pants: Oh, goodness, no. That's what the gala planning committees are for. Nopony could handle all this. [sips] Are those... sequins?
Rarity: Still rude.
Twilight Sparkle: Ooh! New plan, everypony! We're going to delegate!
Rainbow Dash: [to Upper Crust] You! You're on food duty!
Rarity: [to Jet Set] I need gemstones! And purple satin!
Fluttershy: [to Fleur de Lis] Tell the ponies at the gates there's a slight delay on the gala! Oh, um, if it's not too much trouble, I mean.
Applejack: Uh... Now, who can we get to clean up all this garbage?
[stomping]
Pinkie Pie: I'm delegating!
Twilight Sparkle: So this is how you rule Equestria!
Princess Luna: [slurping, sighs] Things are so much more relaxing without my bossy sister.
[ponies laughing]
Princess Celestia: Who needs a gloomy sister moping around all the time anyway? [whinnies]
Princess Luna: [groans]
"Nurse Sweetheart": Honestly, princess, didn't you wear any sunblock?
Princess Luna: That's a thing? [sighs] Celestia would've warned me. If she were here.
Princess Celestia: Now, was it two left turns and a right, or two right turns and a left?
[whoosh!]
Princess Celestia: Luna always handled directions.
[twig snaps]
[chicken clucks]
Princess Celestia: [shakily] And scared away the chickens!
Princess Celestia: Oh! Heh. I thought climbing Mount Filly-mane-jaro was on my list.
Princess Luna: I'm not copying you! I just wanted to watch the sunrise.
Princess Celestia: Ah. I'm, uh, here for the moonset.
[beat]
Princess Celestia: So, uh, how did the rest of your day go?
Princess Luna: Oh, amazing! Yeah. Uh, f-fantastic. Best ever, really.
Princess Celestia: Yeah. Me... too. Mmm.
Princess Luna: You... You can walk with me. You know, i-if you want, I mean.
Princess Celestia: Oh, well... [scoffs] Since we're going the same way. [laughs]
Princess Luna: This is so beautiful. It must be amazing in the sunlight.
Princess Celestia: The night's pretty special, too.
Princess Celestia and Princess Luna: Lucky star!
Princess Luna: You taught me to look for those when I was a filly.
Princess Celestia: [laughs] Hope I wasn't too bossy doing it.
Princess Luna: You know, being with your sister all the time is hard, but being without her? It's even harder.
Princess Celestia: I do know. [sighs] And I wouldn't trade you for any of the adventures on my list.
Princess Luna: Not even your zip line?
[poof!]
Princess Celestia: Not even my zip line.
Princess Luna: I'm sorry I said those things before. Sometimes it's just tough being the little sister.
Princess Celestia: It's not always easy being the big sister either. I'm sorry, too.
Princess Luna: [gasps] The sun and the moon together? At the same time?
Princess Celestia: Now, where have I seen that before?
Princess Celestia and Princess Luna: [laugh]
[long pause]
Princess Celestia: You think maybe Twilight's having trouble with the amulet?
Princess Luna: We should probably go help her.
Spike: Okay, okay! I think I got it! Sunburst says we just need to reset the amulet with this! Turn the screw on the back—
[cranking]
[sproing!]
Spike: ...and no more than one half turn.
Twilight Sparkle: [whimpers] Does anypony have some tape?!
