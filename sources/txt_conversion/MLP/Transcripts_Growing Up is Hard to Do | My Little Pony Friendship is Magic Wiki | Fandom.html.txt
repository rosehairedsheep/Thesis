Apple Bloom: I can't believe we're goin' to the Appleloosa County Fair!
Sweetie Belle: Animal shows, carnival rides...
Scootaloo: And all kinds of food on a stick! [slurps]
[thud]
Sweetie Belle: Speaking of food, did you pack snacks for the train?
Scootaloo: For there and back.
Apple Bloom: And our train tickets are all set.
Sweetie Belle: And I've got our whole itinerary planned!
Apple Bloom: Are you sure you're not Twilight's sister?
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo: [laugh]
Scootaloo: Weeks of planning has all come down to this. All we have to do now is wait for our chaperone to get here.
Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: Mm-hmm!
[pause]
Apple Bloom: So when's Rainbow Dash comin'?
Scootaloo: I thought you were gonna ask Applejack.
Apple Bloom: [to Sweetie Belle] I don't suppose you asked Rarity?
Sweetie Belle: You mean we spent all this time planning a trip, and none of us asked anypony to take us?!
Scootaloo: In our defense, every other part of the trip was planned really well.
[clatter]
[theme song]
Sweetie Belle: We really did think of everything except finding somepony to take us, and the fair is only today!
Rarity: I'm sorry, darlings, but I can't possibly go to Appleloosa. I promised to deliver a new design to Fancy Pants for his Monocle and Top Hat Appreciation Society soiree.
Sweetie Belle: Can't you finish it tomorrow?
[smack!]
Rarity: Well, I could. But you'll learn as you get older how important it is to keep your promises, especially when running a business.
Sweetie Belle: Maybe we should just go by ourselves?
Rarity: What?! Oh, my dear, no! Appleloosa is far too long a train ride for young foals without accompaniment. You could end up in the wrong place entirely. Why don't you see if Rainbow Dash is free?
Rainbow Dash: Sorry, but I just heard from Spitfire that a whole bunch of storm clouds got loose from the cloud factory, and she needs every Wonderbolt to help bust 'em.
Scootaloo: Aw, come on, Rainbow Dash! They won't miss one pony! And we really want to go to the fair! Apparently we're too young to go alone.
Rainbow Dash: Well, duh. Young ponies like you could get lost and never find your way back. But I still can't go. Being a Wonderbolt isn't just about showing off. It's also a responsibility. You'll understand when you get older. I'm sure you'll find somepony else to take you.
Applejack: I wish I could, sugarcube. But Big Mac's not feelin' well today.
Apple Bloom: Awww. But Big Mac's old enough to take care of himself, and we'd all have so much fun together.
Applejack: Sometimes takin' care of somepony is more important than havin' fun. Speakin' of which, don't you even think about tryin' to go without a grown pony there to take care of you. You could end up in hot water or worse.
Apple Bloom: We know.
Scootaloo: The fair could be over before we find somepony to take us.
Apple Bloom: But then we thought of you, since the fair will be full of all sorts of animals and creatures.
Fluttershy: I'm sorry, but Twilight has an important magical research project, and she's asked for my help.
Sweetie Belle: I guess that means Twilight's busy, too?
Twilight Sparkle: I'm afraid I am. Star Swirl sent me this enchanted flower, and it isn't doing well. If I figure out its magical properties, maybe we can save it.
Scootaloo: So that's a "no" on going with us to the fair?
Apple Bloom: We've already asked Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity, and none of them can come.
Sweetie Belle: And everypony made it clear we're too young to go on our own.
Twilight Sparkle: Oh, definitely. You could take the wrong train or miss your stop...
Fluttershy: Or get lost in a strange town and end up in a dangerous situation with nopony to help you.
Cutie Mark Crusaders: We know!
Twilight Sparkle: I know it's hard, but sometimes you just can't do what you want.
Scootaloo: I'm pretty sure if you wanted to go to the fair, you could.
Twilight Sparkle: Sure, grown-ups can do a lot of things that foals can't. But there's plenty we can't do either. Like right now, I can't find a single reference to this flower!
Fluttershy: None of the birds or insects I've talked to have heard of it either.
Twilight Sparkle: I wonder if there's anything in Shadetail Evergreen's Tome of Flora and Fauna?
Fluttershy: That book's pretty out of date, but it might be worth a try.
Twilight Sparkle: I think there's a copy in the library filed under "Discontinued But Still Potentially Useful Ancient Texts". Unless I put it under "Hokum With a Slight Chance of Practical Applications".
Apple Bloom: I guess this flower is the most interestin' thing we're gonna see today.
Scootaloo: Unless you count watching Twilight struggle to remember how she organizes her books.
Sweetie Belle: I bet every pony in Equestria is in Appleloosa right now.
Apple Bloom: Every pony but us.
Scootaloo: I wish we didn't have to wait to grow up.
[magic sounds]
Apple Bloom: I wish it would happen all at once. Then we'd know everything we need to get to the fair and back with no problem.
[louder magic sounds]
Sweetie Belle: I just wish we were as old as our sisters. Then nopony could tell us what to do, and we'd be able to take care of ourselves.
[even louder magic sounds]
Scootaloo: Hey, Sweetie Belle, why's your face all lit up?
[high-pitched humming]
[zap!]
[whooshing]
Cutie Mark Crusaders: [whimpering]
[whooshing stops]
Cutie Mark Crusaders: [groan]
Apple Bloom: [gasps]
Sweetie Belle: [gasps]
Scootaloo: [gasps]
[shatter!]
Cutie Mark Crusaders: [gasp]
Scootaloo: Do you know what this means?
Cutie Mark Crusaders: We can go to the fair! [laugh]
Scootaloo: [laughing]
Apple Bloom: I hope you brought the tickets. We've gotta hurry if we're going to make the train.
Sweetie Belle: I think we'll be fine. Check out how fast we're going! Grown-up legs are strong!
Scootaloo: You're not kidding!
[rattling]
Scootaloo: I don't know how much of this my scooter can take!
[ponies gasp]
Apple Bloom: And nopony yelled at us to slow down even once! Being a grown-up is great!
[pocketwatch ticking]
Cutie Mark Crusaders: [panting]
[train whistle blows]
Cutie Mark Crusaders: [sigh]
Sweetie Belle: We made it!
Apple Bloom: Of course we did! We're grown-up ponies now! We can do anything! And all those worries Twilight and the others had don't apply anymore. Because we're big! And bein' big is all it takes!
[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
Woke up this morning feeling tired and small
But look at us now - we must be ninety feet tall
Don't have to worry 'bout making mistakes
Because being big is all it takes
[Scootaloo]
A tiny twist of fate brought on this big change
Give me room, gotta zoom, I've got plans to arrange
Can do what I want, be it run, trot, or traipse
'Cause being big is all it takes
[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
Being big isn't just a size
At bedtime we don't even have to close our eyes
We're in control now, for goodness' sake
'Cause being big is all it takes
[Sweetie Belle]
Leaving behind the little pony you've known
Stepping out, growing up, making moves of my own
You can't tell me no, there's no place I can't go
Mountains, cities, jungles, or lakes
'Cause being big is all it takes
[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
Being big isn't just a size
We'll tell you our opinion 'cause we're oh, so wise
We're in control now, for goodness' sake
'Cause being big is all it takes
[Scootaloo]
I can eat all the snacks 'cause that's for me to decide
[Apple Bloom]
We know how it all works, even what we ain't tried
[Sweetie Belle]
Facts don't matter now 'cause it's not what we know
We can win any argument with...
[Cutie Mark Crusaders]
"Because I say so!"
Can't stop us now, don't try to stand in our way
We're awake, gonna take all we can from today
Once we had to listen, now you'll hear what we say
Everything is always okay
'Cause being big is all it taaaaaakes
All it takes!
[train chugging]
[brakes hiss]
[train chugging]
Scootaloo: I think I ate too many snacks.
Sweetie Belle: Uh, this doesn't look like Appleloosa.
"Loose Tracks": That's because it isn't...
[creaking]
Apple Bloom: You all heard that, right?
Sweetie Belle: Uh, hello? [to Apple Bloom and Scootaloo] Do you think we got on the wrong train?
Scootaloo: I thought trains just took you where you wanted to go.
"Loose Tracks": [laughing]
Cutie Mark Crusaders: [scream]
"Loose Tracks": Sorry, I don't mean to laugh. But you three must not travel much. This is Hayseed Junction. The train to Appleloosa isn't for a few hours. Or you could set off on hoof. It's treacherous and confusing! Unfit for the young or timid! But you three are grown-ups. You'll be fine. I'll write down some directions.
Sweetie Belle: Maybe we should wait for the train.
Scootaloo: And miss the fair?!
Sweetie Belle: We already ended up in the wrong place, which is exactly what we were warned about. And what if we can't follow the directions?
Apple Bloom: Come on. We didn't come all this way for nothin'. Besides, I've been through a swamp as a young pony. As a grown-up, it'll be a snap.
Scootaloo: Grown-ups always know the way!
Sweetie Belle: Because being big is all it takes!
"Loose Tracks": [laughs maniacally, hacks, inhales] Sorry. I've got kind of a throat thing.
[montage music]
[splash]
[bufogren croaks]
Scootaloo: Aah!
[splash]
[vines stretch, recoil]
[bubbling]
[splashing]
Scootaloo: Sweetie Belle, are you sure this is the right way?
[wind whistling]
[branches creaking]
Scootaloo: Sweetie Belle?
[bushes rustle]
Sweetie Belle: Scootaloo?
Scootaloo: Aah!
[thud]
Scootaloo: Don't do that!
Apple Bloom: Girls?
[snap!]
[thud]
Apple Bloom: Maybe we should head back to the station.
Sweetie Belle: I'm not sure we can. I think we're lost.
Scootaloo: Just like Twilight and the others said!
Spur: Well, where were you when I was feeding and caring for him?!
[bushes rustle]
Biscuit: [screams] Wild swamp ponies!
"Spring Green" and "Savage Honeydew": Hmph!
Sweetie Belle: We're not wild swamp ponies. We're just grown-ups.
Scootaloo: And we are definitely not lost.
Spur: Okay. But that swamp is pretty confusing if you're not from around here. I'm Spur, and this is Biscuit.
[rattling]
Apple Bloom: I'm Apple Bloom. Nice to meet you. But, uh, we're not confused. We're just... explorin' new ways to Appleloosa.
Biscuit: Hey, that's where we're going!
Spur: No, it isn't!
Sweetie Belle: Uh, which is it?
Spur: Biscuit thinks he can just take Bloofy here to the fair.
Biscuit: Why not? It's just up the road. And Bloofy's my pet, too.
Spur: Since when?! Bloofy's never even seen a crowd! Which you'd know if you ever took care of him!
Biscuit: Did you ever think meeting all those ponies might be good for him?
Bloofy: [chittering]
Apple Bloom: He seems okay meetin' us.
Biscuit: See? They're grown-ups, and they get it. Bloofy should totally come to the fair with me, right?
Spur: Y'all don't really think that, do ya?
Sweetie Belle: Um... Hold on. Us grown-ups need to confer. [to Apple Bloom and Scootaloo] What do you girls think?
Scootaloo: If they go to the fair, we can tag along!
Apple Bloom: And Spur probably should share Bloofy. I mean, that's somethin' a grown-up would say, right?
Sweetie Belle: As grown-up ponies, we think you should share Bloofy and let Biscuit take him to the fair.
Biscuit: That is some quality grown-up advice!
Bloofy: [chittering]
Spur: But Bloofy's never been around anything that exciting. What if something goes wrong?
Apple Bloom: We're headed to the fair, too. Since we're such great advice givers, feel free to ask us for more.
[ponies chattering]
[horseshoe clangs]
[splash!]
[ponies laughing]
Sweetie Belle: [laughs] It's everything I thought it'd be!
Bloofy: [squealing]
Passerby Pony: Well, my goodness, what an interesting critter! You should enter him in the animal showcase. You'd be sure to win "Most Interesting Creature"!
Biscuit: Animals showcase? That's exactly what we should do!
Spur: That seems like a bad idea. What do you grown-ups think?
Cutie Mark Crusaders: [laugh]
[thunk!]
[bell rings]
[ponies cheer]
Cutie Mark Crusaders: [laugh]
Sweetie Belle: Whoo-hoo! Whoo-whoo!
[splat]
Spur: What happened to being able to ask your advice?! You ran off the second we got here!
Scootaloo: [gulps]
Apple Bloom: Where's Biscuit and Bloofy?
Spur: That's why I came to find you.
[fanfare]
[ponies chattering]
Spur: It's one thing to bring Bloofy to the fair, but it's another to stick him in a showcase!
Biscuit: What's the big deal?
Sweetie Belle: You are supposed to be sharing him.
Scootaloo: Yeah, I'm with Biscuit. The showcase looks like fun.
Spur: Sorry if I think taking care of Bloofy is more important than having fun!
Bloofy: [shrieking]
Biscuit: Bloofy's just excited. He probably just wants to get out.
Bloofy: [chitters, sniffs]
Apple Bloom: Are you sure you're not just upset you have to share him? What if you took a little break?
Spur: You mean, like, leave?
Sweetie Belle: If sharing him is too hard, that might be the best thing. Take our word for it. We are grown-ups.
Apple Bloom: I don't know what Spur's so worried about. Bloofy and Biscuit are havin' fun.
Scootaloo: Yeah. What could go wrong?
Bloofy: [chittering]
[ponies cheering]
Bloofy: [squealing]
[whooshing]
Scootaloo: Me and my big grown-up mouth.
[ponies screaming]
[whooshing]
Apple Bloom: Do you think this qualifies as gettin' into a dangerous situation with no grown pony to help us?
[cow moos]
Sweetie Belle: I think we're the grown ponies that need to be helping today!
Scootaloo: Bloofy! Treats, treats, treats! Who wants a treat?
[whooshing continues]
[teleportation zap]
Biscuit: What do we do now?!
Cutie Mark Crusaders: Run!
[train whistle blows]
Fluttershy: I hope you're right about the girls coming here.
Twilight Sparkle: Well, once we read Shadetail Evergreen's warning that the flower grants wishes, it wasn't a stretch to think they wished themselves to the fair. It's all they were talking about.
Fluttershy: Or maybe, since we told them they were too young to come, they wished to become grown-ups, then came here and caused some kind of trouble that led to a town-wide panic!
[distant screaming]
Twilight Sparkle: Yeah. Or that.
Apple Bloom: Twilight! Fluttershy! Thank goodness! I know you're not gonna believe it, but it's me, Apple Bloom!
Scootaloo: And I'm Scootaloo! We kinda got turned into grown-ups!
Sweetie Belle: And we thought we could take the train here, since we were old enough, but we ended up in the wrong place, just like you said we would!
Apple Bloom: And got lost!
Scootaloo: Just like you said we would!
Apple Bloom: Then we met these foals who led us to the fair, and we tried to give them some grown-up-style advice, but it turned their pet into a tornado that might destroy the whole town!
[whooshing]
Fluttershy: Goodness! A Whirling Mungtooth! They are very rare and just the cutest little things when they're not excited.
[crash!]
Fluttershy: This one's excited.
Scootaloo: How do we calm him down?
Fluttershy: When they're young, a Mungtooth forms a tight bond with its caretaker. They're the only ones who can get them to stop spinning.
Biscuit: Spur's the one who really took care of Bloofy. We have to find her!
Twilight Sparkle: You all go look for Spur. Fluttershy and I will do our best to keep everypony here safe.
[teleportation zap]
[ewe bleats]
Spur: That's Bloofy?!
[teleportation zap]
Biscuit: I'm so sorry, Spur. You knew what was best for him all along.
Apple Bloom: And even though we seem like grown-ups, you were way more responsible than us.
Spur: What do you mean, "seem" like grown-ups?
Sweetie Belle: Uh, we don't have time to explain. Right now we have to stop this, and you're the only one who can do it.
Spur: How?
Fluttershy: I'll show you. He mostly just needs to see you.
Spur: Hey there, Bloofy-boo. It's okay.
[whooshing stops]
Bloofy: [squeals, chitters]
Spur: How did you know what to do?
Fluttershy: After years of experience with animals, I've picked up a few things.
Spur: Well, one thing's for sure. Bloofy definitely earned the "Most Interesting Creature" prize.
Biscuit: I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.
Apple Bloom: We all are.
Spur: I guess grown-ups aren't always perfect.
Twilight Sparkle: They sure aren't, but young foals pretending to be grown-ups are even less so.
Spur: What do you mean?
Twilight Sparkle: There's only one petal left. But I think the three of you know what to wish for. And I'm pretty sure Star Swirl won't mind.
Cutie Mark Crusaders: We wish we were foals again.
[magic sounds]
Biscuit: Hold on! You three are actually younger than us?!
Sweetie Belle: The flower turned us into grown-ups, so we figured we could do whatever we wanted. But I guess that's not exactly true.
Apple Bloom: We did everything real grown-ups told us not to and caused all kinds of trouble.
Scootaloo: And things could have been a lot worse. I guess we were pretty selfish.
Twilight Sparkle: I'm glad you learned something. That's what growing up is. Which is why you probably shouldn't skip any of it.
Sweetie Belle: I know we didn't make the best impression, but we sure would like to visit you and Bloofy some day.
Spur: I guess that'd be okay, on one condition. You get a real grown-up to bring you.
Cutie Mark Crusaders: Deal!
All: [laughing]
