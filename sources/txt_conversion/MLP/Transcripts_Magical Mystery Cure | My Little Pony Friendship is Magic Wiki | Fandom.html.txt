[Twilight Sparkle]
Morning in Ponyville shimmers
Morning in Ponyville shines
And I know for absolute certain
That everything is certainly fine
There's the Mayor en route to her office
There's the sofa clerk selling some quills
Davenport: Morning, kid!
[Twilight Sparkle]
My Ponyville is so gentle and still
Can things ever go wrong?
I don't think that they will
Morning in Ponyville shimmers
Morning in Ponyville shines
And I know for absolute certain
That everything is certainlyâ€”
[splash]
Twilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash, that's not funny!
Rarity: Terribly sorry, darling. I'm afraid I'm... I'm not good with the thundery ones.
Twilight Sparkle: [gasp] Something tells me everything is not going to be fine.
[theme song]
Twilight Sparkle: What are you doing? What happened to your cutie mark?
Rarity: Whatever do you mean, Twilight? I'm simply doing what I've done since the day it first appeared. Does my sky look fabulous or what?
[ponies complaining]
Rarity: Too last season?
Twilight Sparkle: Where is Rainbow Dash? Why isn't she handling this?
Spike: [yawns] I still don't know what you had to wake me up for. I love sleeping in the rain.
Twilight Sparkle: It's not about the weather, Spike. Rarity had Rainbow Dash's cutie mark and said this was Rainbow Dash's cottage. Something strange is going on... [knocks]
[animal noises]
Rainbow Dash: Hey, guys.
Twilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash! Why is Rarity doing your job?
[crash]
Twilight Sparkle: And what in Equestria is going on in... here?
[Rainbow Dash]
These animals don't listen, no, not one little bit
They run around out of control and throw their hissy fits
[cat hissing]
It's up to me to stop them, 'cause plainly you can see
It's got to be my destiny, and it's what my cutie mark is telling me
[Fluttershy]
[blows balloon]
I try to keep them laughing, put a smile upon their face
But no matter what I try, it seems a bit of a disgrace
[blows party horn]
[laughter]
I have to entertain them, it's there for all to see
It's got to be my destiny, and it's what my cutie mark is telling me
[Pinkie Pie]
I don't care much for pickin' fruit and plowin' fields ain't such a hoot
No matter what I try, I cannot fix this busted water chute!
I've got so many chores to do, it's no fun being me
But it has to be my destiny, 'cause it's what my cutie mark is telling me
[Applejack]
Lookie here at what I made, I think that it's a dress
I know it doesn't look like much, I'm under some distress
Could y'all give me a hand here and help me fix this mess?
My destiny is not pretty, but it's what my cutie mark is tellin' me
[Rarity]
I'm in love with weather patterns, but the others have concerns
For I just gave them frostbite over top of their sunburns
I have to keep on trying, for everyone can see
[Rarity and Rainbow Dash]
It's got to be
[Fluttershy]
It's got to be
[Pinkie Pie]
My destiny
[Applejack]
My destiny
[Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy]
And it's what my cutie mark
[Pinkie Pie and Applejack]
It's what my cutie mark
[Rarity, Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Applejack]
Yes, it's what my cutie mark is telling me!
Twilight Sparkle: This is bad. This is very, very bad.
Spike: What's going on? Why is this happening?!
Twilight Sparkle: Last night when you were taking one of your seven-hour bubble baths, I got a special delivery from the princess.
Twilight Sparkle: Dear Twilight Sparkle,
The spell contained on the last page of this book is Star Swirl the Bearded's secret unfinished masterpiece. [gasps] Ooh! He was never able to get it right, and thus abandoned it. I believe you are the only pony who can understand and rewrite it. Princess Celestia
From one to another, another to one. A mark of one's destiny singled out alone, fulfilled. That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't even rhyme!
Twilight Sparkle: I cast the spell so I could find out what it was, but nothing seemed to happen. But now I know something did happen. The spell has changed the Elements of Harmony! That must be why their cutie marks are all wrong!
Spike: So just cast a counter-spell to switch them back.
Twilight Sparkle: Oh. There is no counter-spell!
Spike: Why don't you just use that memory spell you used to fix everypony when Discord was here?
Twilight Sparkle: It's not their memories, Spike. It's their true selves that have been altered!
Spike: Zecora's cure for the cutie pox?
Twilight Sparkle: That won't work either...
Spike: Well [sighs], maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe our friends will grow to like their new lives.
Twilight Sparkle: No, Spike. They're not who they are meant to be anymore. Their destinies are now changed, and it's all my fault.

[Twilight Sparkle]
I have to find a way
To make this all okay
I can't believe this small mistake
Could've caused so much heartache
Oh why, oh why?
Losing promise
I don't know what to do
Seeking answers
I fear I won't get through to you
Oh why, oh why?
Twilight Sparkle: Oh, Spike, what have I done?
Spike: Aw, come on, Twilight, you'll figure out a way to fix this. These are your friends.
Twilight Sparkle: You're right, Spike. And they mean more to me than anything. My friends...
Spike: Twilight? Are you alright?
Twilight Sparkle: I've got it! I know what to do!
Spike: You do?
Twilight Sparkle: I may not be able to remind them of who they are, but I can show them what they mean to each other. They'll find the part of themselves that's been lost so they can help the friend they care about so much! Come on, Spike!
[bits clinking]
Twilight Sparkle: Fluttershy, wait!
Fluttershy: Oh... Hey, Twilight...
Twilight Sparkle: Where are you going?
Fluttershy: I'm moving back to Cloudsdale. I don't know what's wrong, but I can't seem to make anypony laugh.
[whoopee cushion deflating]
Twilight Sparkle: Before you go, I was wondering if you might be willing to help Rainbow Dash. She's really struggling with her animals.
Fluttershy: But... I don't really know anything about animals...
Twilight Sparkle: But you do know something about Rainbow Dash.
Fluttershy: I... know that she's a true friend, and I'll do anything I can to help her.
[thunk]
Rainbow Dash: [muffled] Whoa!
Twilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash: I'm in here! Help! I'm trapped!
Fluttershy: Hurry, Twilight! Can't you do some sort of spell to get her out?
Twilight Sparkle: No. Fluttershy, you're the only one who can help! Rainbow Dash needs you!
Fluttershy: Um... Hello? Little... woodland creatures? I know that you're all very upset and feel like giving Rainbow Dash a hard time, but we'd all really appreciate it if you'd calm down and, um, maybe... rest for a bit? Oh! Uh... look! Here's some nice, juicy leaves for you to munch on. And some crunchy, munchy acorns too. Uh, wouldn't you like to take a break and have a little snack?
[cutlery clinking]
[animals eating]
Fluttershy: Aww, look at that. I guess you were all just cranky because you were hungry. Oh, you are very welcome, little friends.
Bear: [kisses]
Fluttershy: Goodness, it's like I can understand them! I... I feel strange, like... like this is what I'm meant to do, like this is who I am! My destiny! Wha... what happened?
Twilight Sparkle: Fluttershy, look! Your cutie mark!

Twilight Sparkle: It worked! It worked! Oh, I'm so happy you're back to normal! Now we need your help!

Rarity: [gasps] Oh my, what a terrible dream I had. Or, maybe I'm still having it.
Twilight Sparkle: Rarity, Pinkie Pie is about to lose the apple farm. We need Applejack's help!
Rarity: Lose the apple farm? Well we can't let that happen, now can we?
[Rarity]
Pinkie Pie is in trouble
We need to get there by her side
We can try to do what we can now
For together we can be her guide

Applejack: Yee-haw! Now that's more like it! What's next?
Twilight Sparkle: The townspeople are furious. We need the old Pinkie Pie back.
Applejack: I'm on it. I know just the thing.
[Applejack]
The townspeople need you
They've been sad for a while
They march around, face a-frown
And never seem to smile
And if you feel like helpin'
We'd appreciate a lot
If you'd get up there and spread some cheer
From here to Canterlot
Pinkie Pie: Come on ponies, I wanna see you SMILE!
Crowd: PINKIE!

Twilight Sparkle: [echoing] A mark of one's destiny, singled out alone, fulfilled. [normal] [gasps] Wait a second, that's it! I understand now! I know how to fix the spell!
From all of us together, together we're friends. With the marks of our destinies made one, there is magic without end!
Rest of main cast: [cries of shock]
Fluttershy: [gasps] What happened?
Rest of main cast: [exclamations of shock]
Twilight Sparkle: [echoing] Hello? Where am I? What is this place?
Princess Celestia: [echoing] Congratulations, Twilight. I knew you could do it.
Twilight Sparkle: [echoing] Princess... I don't understand. What did I do?
Princess Celestia: You did something today that's never been done before. Something even a great unicorn like Star Swirl the Bearded was not able to do, because he did not understand friendship like you do. The lessons you've learned here in Ponyville have taught you well. You have proven that you're ready, Twilight.
Twilight Sparkle: Ready? Ready for what?

[Princess Celestia]
You've come such a long, long way
And I've watched you from that very first day
To see how you might grow
To see what you might do
To see what you've been through
And all the ways you've made me proud of you
It's time now for a new change to come
You've grown up and your new life has begun
To go where you will go
To see what you will see
To find what you will be
For it's time for you to fulfill your destiny
Applejack: Twilight? Is that you?
Rest of main cast: [gasps]
Applejack: Wha... I-I've never seen anything like it!
Rainbow Dash: Ha! Twilight's got wings! Awesome! A new flying buddy! [laughs]
Rarity: Why, you've become an Alicorn. I didn't even know that was possible.
Pinkie Pie: [screaming]Â Alicorn party!Â [blows party kazoo]
[crowd cheering]
Fluttershy: Wow... You look just like a princess!
Princess Celestia: That's because she is a princess.
Main cast: Huh?
Pinkie Pie: Hold on a second! [drinks] [spits]
Twilight Sparkle: A... A princess?
Princess Celestia: Since you've come to Ponyville, you've displayed the charity, compassion, devotion, integrity, optimism, and of course, the leadership of a true princess.
Twilight Sparkle: But... does this mean I won't be your student anymore?
Princess Celestia: Not in the same way as before. I'll still be here to help and guide you, but we're all your students now, too. You are an inspiration to us all, Twilight.
Twilight Sparkle: But... what do I do now? Is there a book about being a princess I should read?
Princess Celestia: [giggles] There will be time for all of that later.
Princess Celestia: We are gathered here today in celebration of a momentous occasion. My most faithful student, Twilight Sparkle, has done many extraordinary things since she's lived in Ponyville. She even helped reunite me with my sister, Princess Luna. But today, Twilight Sparkle did something extraordinary. She created new magic, proving without a doubt that she is ready to be crowned Equestria's newest princess. Fillies and gentlecolts, may I present for the very first time, Princess Twilight Sparkle!

[Choir]
The Princess Twilight cometh
Behold, behold
A Princess here before us
Behold, behold, behold
Behold, behold (behold, behold)
The Princess Twilight cometh
Behold, behold (behold, behold)
The Princess is
The Princess is here!
[crowd cheering]
Princess Celestia: Say something, Princess.
Twilight Sparkle: Oh. Um... [clears throat] A little while ago, my teacher and mentor Princess Celestia sent me to live in Ponyville. She sent me to study friendship, which is something I didn't really care much about. But now, on a day like today, I can honestly say I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the friendships I've made with all of you. Each one of you taught me something about friendship, and for that, I will always be grateful. Today, I consider myself the luckiest pony in Equestria. Thank you, friends. Thank you, everypony!
[crowd cheering]
Shining Armor: Twilight! I'm so proud of you!
Twilight Sparkle: Are you crying?
Shining Armor: Of course not. It's... it's liquid pride. Totally different thing.
Shining Armor and Twilight Sparkle: [laughing]
Applejack: Way to go, Princess!
Pinkie Pie: Best coronation day ever!
Fluttershy: We love you, Twilight.
Twilight Sparkle: I love you too, girls!

[Twilight Sparkle]
Life in Equestria shimmers
Life in Equestria shines
And I know for absolute certain
[Main cast and crowd]
That everything (that everything)
Yes, everything (yes, everything)
Yes, everything is certainly fine
Itâ€™s fine
Twilight Sparkle: Yes! Everythingâ€™s going to be just fine!
