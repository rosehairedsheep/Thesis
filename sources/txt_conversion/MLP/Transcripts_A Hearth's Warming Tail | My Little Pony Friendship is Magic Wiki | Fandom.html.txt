[Ponies]
Ponies' voices fill the night
Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
Happy hearts so full and bright
Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
Oh, what a sight
Look at the light
All for tonight
Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
[Fluttershy]
Clouds arranged so they're just so
[Pegasi]
Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
[Rainbow Dash]
Gonna make some awesome snow
[Pegasi]
Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
[Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash]
The chill wind blows
Making a show
Snowflakes aglow
[Ponies]
Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
[Pinkie Pie]
A day that's filled with songs to sing
[Ponies]
Ding-dong, ding-dong-ding
[Applejack]
Cakes and pastries we shall bring
[Ponies]
Ding-dong, ding-dong-ding
We're so busy making merry
Windigos should all be wary
[Stallions]
As our mighty voices carry
[Ponies]
Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
[Rarity]
Decorations we shall make
[Ponies]
Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
[Rarity]
Perfection you just cannot fake
[Ponies]
Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
[Rarity]
Not one mistake
Don't let that break
Oh, goodness' sake!
[Ponies]
Hearth's Warming Eve is here once a—
Happy, happy Hearth's Warming Eve
Happy, happy Hearth's Warming Eve
Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again!
Twilight Sparkle: Hey, Starlight! Ready to celebrate your first Hearth's Warming Eve here in Ponyville?
Starlight Glimmer: I was thinking I might just skip it.
Twilight Sparkle and Spike: [gasp]
[theme song]
Spike: Skip Hearth's Warming Eve?!
Starlight Glimmer: I just find it all a little silly. It's mostly a day dedicated to presents and candy, isn't it?
Spike: And why would you deny yourself presents and candy? That's crazy talk!
Twilight Sparkle: I think what Spike means to say is Hearth's Warming is about more than presents and candy. It's a time to spend with friends and family when we celebrate a very important day in Equestria's history.
Starlight Glimmer: I think to most ponies, it's just an excuse for silly songs and fun, not a day to remember some old story.
[magic zap]
Twilight Sparkle: Maybe you just haven't heard the right Hearth's Warming Eve story yet!
Starlight Glimmer: Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns sing songs around a hearth to fight back an eternal winter caused by the mythical windigos? Ha! Every foal and filly knows that story.
Twilight Sparkle: Not that one. My favorite holiday story, "A Hearth's Warming Tale"!
Spike: Oh, I love that one!
Twilight Sparkle: This is the story of a powerful unicorn named Snowfall Frost, who hated Hearth's Warming Eve. It all began many moons ago in Canterlot...
Twilight Sparkle: [narrating] Every home in Canterlot was filled with holiday spirit. Every home... except one. It was said of Snowfall that she was almost as studied as Star Swirl the Bearded. Almost, since everypony knows that Star Swirl was an expert at everything from transfiguration, dimensional calibration, teleportation—
Spike: [narrating] We get it. Star Swirl's awesome.
Twilight Sparkle: [narrating] Right. The point is, Snowfall was also a powerful unicorn. She wanted to be perfect. Anything that got in the way of that was a waste of time.
[bells ringing]
Starlight Glimmer: [gasp] Well, that batch is ruined. Snowdash!
Twilight Sparkle: [narrating] Snowdash was Snowfall's loyal assistant.
Rainbow Dash: What do you need?
Starlight Glimmer: Get this mess cleaned up. Those foolish ponies were ringing those blasted bells outside the window and I lost my concentration!
Rainbow Dash: [under her breath] Whoa, ponies actually enjoying Hearth's Warming Eve. Where did they get that crazy idea?
Starlight Glimmer: Today is nothing to celebrate. Hearth's Warming Eve is a menace. A dangerous day for all of Equestria.
Rainbow Dash: Dangerous?! It's awesome! It's the day we remember how unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth ponies came together in friendship to defeat the windigos!
Starlight Glimmer: That silly legend is the problem! Telling everypony that "singing songs and being nice" will solve anything? I've spent years studying magic, and that's not how it works.
Rainbow Dash: I think you might be missing the point.
[magic zap]
Starlight Glimmer: Work hard, learn, and use your skills to better Equestria. That's a worthy goal for any pony. [sarcastically] But, by all means, if you want to go home early, ignore all of the work you have, and spend the rest—
Rainbow Dash: Sweet!
Starlight Glimmer: Ugh!
[crowd chattering]
Starlight Glimmer: I hate Hearth's Warming Eve! All of Equestria would be better off if we just skipped the day altogether.
[Starlight Glimmer]
Happy Hearth's Warming, they say in the street
Happy Hearth's Warming, they think they're so sweet
Words said so often that they lack any meaning
Why should I join in when I could be intervening?
Everypony loves this cursed holiday
But would they be better off with it out of the way?
Well, okay
Say goodbye to the holiday
With my magic, I'll erase it
The greatest gift that I give today
And everypony will have to face it
No more little games for you to play
After you say goodbye to the holiday
Goodbye, Hearth's Warming, you had a good run
Goodbye, Hearth's Warming, it's over, you're done
Finally set free from your forced celebrations
No need to reply to your trite invitations
Calendar shorter by a single day
Is my magic up to the test?
Time to see, I can't delay
Say goodbye to the holiday
Prepare the spell, no hesitation
All memory shall fade away
See Equestria's new transformation
No more shall anypony say
Happy Hearth's Warming...
[sinister laughter]
...after today!
After today...
Starlight Glimmer: Once the spell is cast, all of Equestria will be better off, and they'll have me to thank for it!
Starlight Glimmer: Wait a minute. Snowfall doesn't like Hearth's Warming Eve so she decides to cast a spell to get rid of it altogether? That seems a little extreme.
Spike: [muttering] Says the pony who tried to make everypony the same by replacing their cutie marks with equal signs. [sips cocoa]
Twilight Sparkle: I think what Spike is trying to say is that everypony has their reasons for doing things. Even Snowfall. And if I could continue the story, we might just find out what they are.
Spike: Proceed.
Twilight Sparkle: Snowfall was all set to cast her spell that would erase Hearth's Warming Eve for all time...
Twilight Sparkle: [narrating] ...when a voice from the hearth caught her attention.
Applejack: You sure you wanna go through with this?
Starlight Glimmer: Huh?! Who's there?!
[bubbling]
Applejack: The Spirit of Hearth's Warmin' Past, that's who. And you and me have got to have us a little chat.
Starlight Glimmer: A spirit?! [suspiciously] I didn't cast any spirit summoning spell. What are you doing here?
Applejack: You don't think a spell like that would get by without some powerful forces noticin'? You've got our attention, Snowfall Frost, and we've got some pretty strong opinions on this spell of yours.
Starlight Glimmer: "We"?
Applejack: They'll be along in a bit. For now, it's just you and me. Let's get a move on. We got a ton to see and barely any time to see it.
Starlight Glimmer: I'm not going anywhere. I've got a spell to cast, and I don't need a history lesson about Hearth's Warming Eve.
Applejack: We aren't goin' to the past to learn about the holiday. We're goin' to learn about you.
Starlight Glimmer: [yelps] [wailing]
[Applejack]
As a young thing, life sure is somethin'
You go makin' choices large and small
Always growin' like a seedlin'
And playin' is like dreamin'
And before you know it, big and tall
And every little bitty choice you make
Sends you down a path to who you are today
So let's take a little trip down memory lane
And see just what the past has to say
Aw, look how cute you were. Looks like you're not too upset it's Hearth's Warming Eve either.
The seeds of the past
They grow pretty fast
Just look at who you were back then
The seeds, as they grow
Look what they can show
Reveal the truth time and again
Professor Flintheart: Just what do you think you're doing, Snowfall?
Young Starlight Glimmer: Decorating the classroom for Hearth's Warming Eve, Professor Flintheart!
Professor Flintheart: You said you wanted to learn to be a powerful unicorn, did you not?
Young Starlight Glimmer: I do!
Professor Flintheart: And what is the way that one becomes a powerful unicorn?
Young Starlight Glimmer: [clears throat] Work hard, learn, and use your skills to better Equestria.
Professor Flintheart: And how do these help you to learn magic?
Young Starlight Glimmer: I want to be strong enough to stop windigos and help ponies!
Professor Flintheart: That's just a story we tell little ponies. Real magic takes time to learn.
[ornament shattering]
Professor Flintheart: It's your choice. Spend your time learning to become a powerful unicorn or play with your toys and make nothing of yourself.
[Applejack]
Then some distress, words so careless
Standin' there, you don't know what to do
Feelin' helpless, you can't make it hurt less
So you go and change your point of view
And in that moment, though you didn't know it
Your defenses set up walls you built to last
Leading to the pony you've become today
And the spell you're about to cast
It all comes from your past
[Starlight Glimmer]
The seeds of the past
We grow up so fast
Some hurts never go away
[Applejack]
The seeds, as they grow
This we can't let go
All tied to this one holiday
[bubbling]
Starlight Glimmer: [gasps] Spirit? What am I supposed to—
[sound of confetti launching]
Pinkie Pie: [reverberating] Snowfall Frost! It is I, the Spirit of Hearth's Warming Presents!
Starlight Glimmer: Um, don't you mean "Present", like the time?
Pinkie Pie: No! Toys, Hearth's Warming doll... Here, want a cupcake?
Starlight Glimmer: Fine, "Presents". All of the pointless things ponies waste their time on.
Pinkie Pie: Oh, Snowfall, it's not what the gift is that matters, it's what the gift means!
Starlight Glimmer: It doesn't mean anything. It's just stuff!
Pinkie Pie: Exactly! Sometimes a cupcake means "I love you!" Or a toy means "Hi, how're you doing?" Sometimes a book means "Your mane looks amazing!" And sometimes a scarf means... Well, a scarf usually means you look cold. That one's easy.
Starlight Glimmer: I don't understand anything you're saying.
Pinkie Pie: Whoa! Whoa! [trembles]
Starlight Glimmer: What's happening to you?!
Pinkie Pie: My Spirit of Hearth's Warming Presents Sense is going off! That means a song is coming on!
[Pinkie Pie]
Take a look at everything around you
All the smells that surely will astound you
Open up your heart, it will surround you
In the magic of Hearth's Warming Eve
The little things that make it better
Little ponies spreading cheer
Give a toy, a hug, a sweater
Memories that last all year
The present's always filled with presents
Large, medium, and small
Sometimes the most important things
Aren't very big at all
[tap-dancing solo]
What a party, there's so much to see here
Can't believe you didn't want to be here
You'd have had a blast, I guarantee here
This is the spirit of Hearth's Warming Eve
Cider's flowing, this is living
Come on and feel the beat
Life is better when you're giving
Each time you do it feels so sweet
The present's always filled with presents
So come on, open your eyes
Spend time with ponies just like you
And watch your spirits rise
The present's always filled with presents
Take a look around
The reason for the holiday
Is quite easily found
Yes, the reason for the holiday
Is quite easily found
And the reason is to be with your friends!
Twilight Sparkle: [singsong, as Pinkie Pie] And the reason is to be with your friends! [normal] What?
Starlight Glimmer: You know you're doing your Pinkie Pie voice, right?
Twilight Sparkle: I was not!
Spike: [laughing]
Starlight Glimmer: So, what happens next?
Twilight Sparkle: Well, the party was—
Spike: Wait! Can we take a quick break? I need to refill my cocoa.
Twilight Sparkle: [groans] Fine. But hurry up! We're almost to the best part!
Spike: [blows] Okay, I'm ready.
Twilight Sparkle: The party was in full swing.
Rarity: Snowdash!
Rainbow Dash: Hey, Merry.
Rarity: Why, whatever is the matter, darling?
Fluttershy: Was it the eggnog? Oh, I knew I put in too much cinnamon!
Rainbow Dash: Oh, no, the eggnog was awesome, Flutterholly, I'm just mad at somepony who was complaining about how awful Hearth's Warming Eve is.
Rarity: I don't suppose that pony's name starts with "Snow"?
Fluttershy: And ends with "Frost"?
Rainbow Dash: She said Hearth's Warming Eve is just an excuse to party, and we would all be better off spending time working to make Equestria a better place.
Crowd: [booing]
Rarity: What does Snowfall think a better Equestria looks like?
Rainbow Dash: Ponies working hard, learning, and using their abilities for the benefit of Equestria.
Fluttershy and Rarity: [giggling]
[thunk]
[foals laughing]
Rarity: [muffled] It looks like we've got everything on Snowfall's list right here.
Fluttershy: I think a perfect Equestria looks a lot like a Hearth's Warming Eve party.
Pinkie Pie: Me too! Too bad it's going to be the last one ever! Ever! Ever! Ever! [echoes out]
Starlight Glimmer: Spirit? What do you mean? What's going to happen?!
[wind blowing]
Starlight Glimmer: Who are you?
Princess Luna: I am the Spirit of Hearth's Warming Yet to Come.
Starlight Glimmer: Are you here to show me what future Hearth's Warming Eves are like?
Princess Luna: No, for there are no more Hearth's Warming Eves for me to show.
Starlight Glimmer: Why not?
Princess Luna: You will succeed in erasing the holiday, as you wished.
Starlight Glimmer: And what happens?
[Princess Luna]
I see a cold wind blowing through
I see days neither fun nor free
I see a future caused by you
I see a path not meant to be
The future should be filled with magic
Dreams and wishes brought to life
But the days ahead are dark and tragic
No time for hope when all is strife
Whatever might have been
All the dreams that ponies share
Because of you, Snowfall Frost
Now the future is a cold nightmare
Starlight Glimmer: Windigos?! They aren't real! It's just a little filly's story!
Princess Luna: They are all too real, Snowfall, and your actions will allow them to return. The future of Equestria shall be bathed in a blanket of eternal snow!
Starlight Glimmer: No! I never meant for this to happen! I didn't understand! I didn't see how important Hearth's Warming Eve was! Please, spirit! I haven't cast the spell yet! Is there still time?! I'm sorry! [echoing]
[window opens]
[bell ringing]
Starlight Glimmer: There's still time!
[party crowd chattering]
[knocking]
[door opens]
Rarity: Oh, my.
Fluttershy: Snowfall Frost?
Starlight Glimmer: I was hoping I wasn't too late for the party? I brought gifts.
[record needle scratch]
Rainbow Dash: [spit-take] Boss?!
Starlight Glimmer: I was wrong earlier, about Hearth's Warming Eve. It's not all about singing and presents. The singing and presents are all about celebrating the ponies in our lives. The ponies we should listen to more often: our friends.
Rainbow Dash: Wow.
[rip]
Rainbow Dash: Dragon toenail? Uh... thanks?
Starlight Glimmer: I was in a hurry. I'll do better next time.
Rainbow Dash: Ha. You kidding? No one's ever given me dragon toenail before! It's awesome! Now come get some eggnog!
Twilight Sparkle: [narrating] And from then on, it was always said of all the Hearth's Warming Eve celebrations, Snowfall's was the Hearth's Warmingest.
Twilight Sparkle: The end.
[book closes]
Twilight Sparkle: Well, that's it! Thanks for letting me read you the story. Guess you can call it a night. Spike and I are heading downstairs, and if you wanted to, you'd be welcome to join us.
[ponies laughing]
Twilight Sparkle: Welcome to the party! Happy Hearth's Warming, Starlight.
Starlight Glimmer: Happy Hearth's Warming, Twilight.
[Starlight Glimmer]
Hearth's Warming Eve is filled with presents
Some take you by surprise
A story shared by your good friends
That makes your spirits rise
Sometimes you just let go of the past
Enjoy the present while it lasts
And really it's not that much to ask
With good friends by your side
Now it's time to celebrate
[Ponies]
Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
[Starlight Glimmer]
All together, feeling great
[Ponies]
Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
[Starlight Glimmer]
Can hardly wait
We'll party 'til late
Our favorite date
[Ponies]
Hearth's Warming Eve is here once a—
Happy, happy Hearth's Warming Eve
Happy, happy Hearth's Warming Eve
Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again!
[instrumental of "Pinkie's Present" plays over credits]
