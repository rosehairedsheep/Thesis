Trixie: I know how hard you've been working lately, so I figured you could use a break.
Starlight Glimmer: [gasps] Trixie, this looks amazing! But my job doesn't really seem like work.
[bracelet chiming]
Starlight Glimmer: Oh! Speaking of...
[teleportation zap]
Trixie: [sighs, blows, sips]
[teleportation zap]
Starlight Glimmer: Sure, being counselor for the students at Twilight's School of Friendship is demanding, but—
[bracelet chiming]
Starlight Glimmer: Oh. One sec.
[teleportation zap]
Trixie: [sips]
[spoon clattering]
[teleportation zap]
Starlight Glimmer: What was I saying? Oh, right. Being able to use the experiences of my checkered past and help young students feels pretty great. Oh, yum! [chomps] Mmm, thanks!
Trixie: Of course I feel nothing but admiration for the work you do, but it is a little all-consuming. And I miss spending time with you.
Starlight Glimmer: What are you talking about? We're spending time right now.
Trixie: Well...
Starlight Glimmer: [chewing]
[bracelet chiming]
Starlight Glimmer: [mouth full] Hold that thought.
[teleportation zap]
Trixie: [growls, chomps]
[teleportation zap]
Starlight Glimmer: [sighs] Sorry. I cast a spell on the door to my office so this bracelet goes off whenever there's a knock. Yona is having the worst time with her braids lately. [sips] Anyway, you were saying?
Trixie: [sips]
Starlight Glimmer: [laughs nervously]
[theme song]
Silverstream: I totally respect my younger cousins' decisions to stay seaponies, but they've never been on dry land. Preparing for a visit with them is almost as much work as the research assignment Headmare Twilight gave me on hazardous fauna of the Everfree Forest! How would you describe a shower to creatures who live in water? So far, I've got "warm" and "steamy". Actually, steam has water in it.
Starlight Glimmer: Silverstream, there are a lot of students who want to see me today.
Silverstream: I just need a few shower adjectives... that don't rely on the wet part.
Starlight Glimmer: [sighs] Well, there's "clean", "relaxing", um...
Silverstream: "Relaxing"... I don't know. A nap's relaxing, too. "Warm" and "clean" are okay. Wow. I have to give this some more thought.
Starlight Glimmer: Oh. Okay. Well, I'm here to help. My door is always open.
Trixie: Except for today, of course.
[door closes]
Student Pony: [whimpers]
Trixie: If we leave now, we can finish everything before sundown.
Starlight Glimmer: Trixie, I-I can't leave. It's almost spring break. Twilight and the others have already left to celebrate the spring solstice in Canterlot, and I have to help the students with any issues before they head home for the holiday.
[bracelet chiming/knocking on door]
[door opens]
[door closes]
Trixie: I know you're busy, but I hope you haven't forgotten about the Spring Solst-astic!
[beat]
Trixie: The party Maud and Mudbriar are throwing?
[beat]
Trixie: Sunburst is coming to town?
[beat]
Trixie: You and I promised to make the cake?
Starlight Glimmer: [scoffs] How could I possibly forget about that?
[bracelet chiming/knocking on door]
[door opens]
Trixie: [low growl]
[door closes]
Trixie: Nopony is saying your job isn't important, but plans you make with your friends are important, too.
Starlight Glimmer: [sighs] I know. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have forgotten. Obviously I need to be available to my students, but that doesn't mean I can't help with all the things we have to do.
Trixie: Good!
Starlight Glimmer: Great!
[beat]
Starlight Glimmer: So... what are all the things we have to do?
Trixie: [whines] Maud needs streamers for the decorations. Sunburst wants us to pick up a genuine pre-Equestrian spring solstice chafing dish from the antique shop.
Starlight Glimmer: Of course he does.
Trixie: Mudbriar wants a bouquet of flowering sticks – whatever that means. And I thought we were both looking forward to Mrs. Cake teaching us the secret recipe to her famous spring solstice cake.
Starlight Glimmer: Oh! I-I totally am! [chuckles] But we could just buy a cake from her, right?
Trixie: We could... but then we'd miss out on baking together. Plus, the time I spent flattering and convincing and begging her to share the recipe with you for nothing! And we promised to make a cake, not buy a cake! And the Great and Powerful Trixie keeps her promises!
Starlight Glimmer: Okay! Why don't we just split up these jobs? I'll get the streamers and the chafing dish. You—
[bracelet chiming]
Starlight Glimmer: —get started on those sticks, and I'll be right back! [laughs nervously] You know, why don't I just hang on to this? Wouldn't want to forget the things I just said I'd take care of. Because I am totally gonna take care of them!
[teleportation zap]
Rose: Could it be plum blossom?
Trixie: I have no idea.
[teleportation zap]
Trixie: [yelps]
[thud]
Starlight Glimmer: Whoops! Heh. Sorry, Rose. But I need a bouquet of flowering sticks, stat!
Trixie: I thought I was getting the flowering sticks.
Rose: Uh, I'm still not exactly sure what they are.
Trixie: No one is.
Starlight Glimmer: Right. Got it. You get the sticks. I'll get the streamers—
[bracelet chiming]
Starlight Glimmer: —riiiight after I take care of what I'm sure is an even smaller student problem than the last one! [laughs nervously]
[teleportation zap]
[glue squirting]
Silverstream: I think I have the shower thing under control. But I can't figure out how to describe a towel.
[bracelet chiming]
[teleportation zap]
Starlight Glimmer: Now, Smolder, I understand the school can be a bit drafty, but that doesn't mean you can breathe fire anywhere you want!
Starlight Glimmer: What do you mean Trixie already picked up Sunburst's genuine pre-Equestrian equinox chafing dish?! That was my job! I think. Wait. Was it?
[bracelet chiming]
Starlight Glimmer: [groans]
[teleportation zap]
[transformation zaps]
Starlight Glimmer: Ocellus, it's perfectly normal for a changeling to struggle with identity issues, but—
Silverstream: Counselor Starlight!
[door opens]
Silverstream: When you're done, I need some synonyms for the word "dry". Or, really, just help explaining the concept.
[door closes]
[teleportation zap]
Starlight Glimmer: Wait, Mrs. Cake! You can't close! Trixie and I need to learn the recipe for your equinox cake!
Mrs. Cake: Oh, it's fine, dear. Trixie was already here. I told her everything she needs to know.
Starlight Glimmer: What? No! Aww! The Great and Powerful Trixie might keep her promises, but the Busy and Distracted Starlight sure doesn't. I promised to help her today, and I haven't done a single thing.
Mrs. Cake: Oh, that doesn't sound hard, dear. A-And I'm not quite sure how to tell you this, but [whispering] your hoof is glowing.
[bracelet chiming]
Starlight Glimmer: Of course it is.
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zap]
[click]
Starlight Glimmer: Trixie? What are you doing here?
Trixie: It's the one place I knew I could find you.
Starlight Glimmer: I am so sorry about today. I'm just so—
Trixie: Busy. I know. Obviously your students are more important than your friends.
Starlight Glimmer: That's not—!
[bracelet chiming/knocking on door]
[door opens]
Silverstream: Starlight, you have a minute?
Starlight Glimmer: Actually, Silverstream, I don't. Besides, I need to lock up the school for the holiday, and it's time you caught the train home. I'm sure a smart and capable student like you can figure out the solution to any problem over the break. But for now, the counselor's office is closed.
[door closes]
Starlight Glimmer: I have a cake to bake.
[clatter]
Sunburst: Yow! Is this cake supposed to be so sharp?
Trixie: [growls]
Sunburst: I mean, it looks really... interesting?
Mudbriar: Technically, it's not symmetrical or aesthetically pleasing.
Trixie: [growls]
Starlight Glimmer: Maybe it's not the best cake. But we made it together, and that's what counts.
Maud Pie: [deadpan] I'm glad you brought it. And everything else. I'm very excited. This is going to be the most perfect party ever.
Trixie: And with all of your students home for the holiday, I won't have to worry about you being summoned to your office in the middle of it.
Starlight Glimmer: Mm-hmm. Nothing is gonna take me away from this party.
Terramar: Hello?! Starlight?!
Starlight Glimmer: [spits]
Terramar: Starlight?!
Maud Pie: [deadpan] Sorry. This is a private cavern.
Terramar: Is Starlight here?! I was told she'd be here!
Starlight Glimmer: What's wrong?
Terramar: I'm Terramar, Silverstream's brother. I've been looking all over for you. Silverstream is missing!
Starlight Glimmer: [gasps]
Trixie: [chewing]
Starlight Glimmer: I don't understand. Silverstream didn't come home?
Terramar: Mm-mm. I was supposed to meet her at the Mount Aris train station, but she never showed up!
Sunburst: It's a long way between Ponyville and Mount Aris. She could be anywhere.
Terramar: Our parents are leading teams of Hippogriffs and seaponies, searching the land and sea between here and our home. They sent me to check the school.
Starlight Glimmer: But the school's closed. All the students are gone.
Terramar: Are you sure? I know she had a big project due for Twilight. Do you think she might've stayed to finish it?
Starlight Glimmer: She never told me about a project.
Trixie: Well, to be fair, you closed your office the last time she came by.
Starlight Glimmer: Really?
Trixie: [short laugh]
Terramar: What kind of counselor turns away a student with a problem?!
Trixie: The kind with too much on her plate! Starlight has always gone out of her way for her students. And I mean always.
Starlight Glimmer: Except apparently when it matters. This is all my fault! You all go back to the party. Terramar and I will check the school. We'll find your sister.
[teleportation zap]
Maud Pie: [deadpan] I should've known it couldn't last. Party perfection is more of a Pinkie thing.
Mudbriar: Mm. I wasn't going to say anything, but these flowers are just glued on, so technically, it wasn't perfect already.
[beat]
Mudbriar: But that's probably not important.
[teleportation zap]
Starlight Glimmer: You check the grounds, and I'll look inside.
[doors open]
Starlight Glimmer: Silverstream?
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zap]
Starlight Glimmer: [echoing] Hello?
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zaps]
Starlight Glimmer: Anycreature?!
[splash]
[teleportation zap]
Terramar: [panting] She's not down here.
Starlight Glimmer: I don't see her anywhere.
Terramar: Did you check her room?
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zap]
Starlight Glimmer: Well, she's not here.
Terramar: No, she isn't. But look at this.
Starlight Glimmer: A cockatrice?
Terramar: Could that be what her project was on? You don't think she went into the Everfree Forest to find a cockatrice by herself, do you?
Starlight Glimmer: I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zap]
Starlight Glimmer: [laughs nervously]
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zap]
All: [yelps]
Starlight Glimmer: What are you all doing here?
Sunburst: We came to help.
Trixie: We couldn't let you handle this alone.
Mudbriar: Technically, she wasn't alone.
[beat]
Mudbriar: But we wanted to help anyway.
Starlight Glimmer: Thanks. All of you. But the students are my responsibility. I'm the one who didn't do my job when it actually mattered.
Trixie: I... might share a bit of the blame for pressuring you into leaving work early.
Starlight Glimmer: But I don't want to ruin your party.
Maud Pie: [deadpan] We can still have a party. A search party.
Terramar: Can we talk about all this later? Silverstream might be in the Everfree Forest alone!
Trixie and Sunburst: [gasp]
Starlight Glimmer: We think she went in to do research on cockatrices.
Sunburst: What?! The gaze of the cockatrice is known to petrify any who dare to cross its path! And the reptilian birds are elusive and solitary! W-Where would we even start?!
Trixie: I have a lot of experience telling ponies that I have experience with the dangerous creatures of Everfree Forest! Follow me!
[zip!]
[tense music]
Trixie: The Great and Directionally Astute Trixie says we go left!
Trixie: This way!
Trixie: [sniffs]
[wind whistling]
[owl hoots]
Trixie: [slurp, chews, spits]
Maud Pie: [deadpan] Weren't we just here?
Starlight Glimmer: Trixie, do you have any idea how to find a cockatrice?
Trixie: No. But usually, when there's a dangerous creature in the forest I don't want to meet, this is how I meet them.
Sunburst: We might need a more concrete plan.
Trixie: Hmph. Suit yourself.
Terramar: Um, according to Silverstream's research, the cockatrice prefers rocky terrain and ample shade.
Trixie: Rocks and shade. Hmm. I can't imagine where we'll find that in a forest.
Maud Pie: [deadpan] Actually, rocks aren't the most hospitable environment for shade trees.
Mudbriar: Technically, pine trees like Pinus cembra or Pinus sylvestris can grow from narrow crevasses or cracks in a rocky rhizosphere.
Maud Pie: [deadpan] You complete me.
Starlight Glimmer: There's some pine trees over there!
[cockatrices clucking and hissing]
Starlight Glimmer: [whispering] I thought you said they were solitary!
Sunburst: [whispering] They are! This must be some kind of migration.
Terramar: [whimpers] At least there's no sign of Silverstream. I can't imagine getting caught in the middle of that flock.
Trixie: [whispering] It's just lucky we're all over here and they're all over there.
[cockatrice hisses]
Mudbriar: Technically—
Trixie: [whispering] Don't even say it!
Starlight Glimmer: Whatever you do, don't look at them. Their gaze can turn you to stone.
Terramar: [whispering] So what do we do?
[cockatrices hiss]
Sunburst: Ruuuuun!
[teleportation zap]
[cockatrices squawk]
Sunburst: [screaming]
[thud]
Sunburst: [groans, babbles]
[teleportation zap]
Starlight Glimmer: Sunburst!
[magic zap]
Starlight Glimmer and Sunburst: Aah!
Starlight Glimmer: Stop! It's me!
Sunburst: Starlight! I'm so sorry. We have to get out of here.
Starlight Glimmer: I know. Hang on.
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zap]
Starlight Glimmer: We can't leave Silverstream might still be in the forest. Stay here. I'll get the others.
[teleportation zap]
Sunburst: Be careful!
[clucking and hissing]
Terramar: The clucking is coming from everywhere!
Trixie: The Great and Powerful Trixie fears no cluck!
[poof!]
[cockatrices hiss]
[teleportation zap]
Starlight Glimmer: Come on!
[teleportation zap]
[cockatrices hiss]
[teleportation zap]
Sunburst: Aah!
[teleportation zap]
[cockatrices hiss]
[teleportation zap]
Starlight Glimmer: Maud! We've got to get out of here!
Maud Pie: [deadpan] I'm not leaving him.
Starlight Glimmer: [gasps]
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zap]
Trixie, Sunburst, and Terramar: [gasps]
Sunburst: Mudbriar's been turned to stone?!
Maud Pie: [deadpan] I didn't think I could love him any more.
Trixie: We've got to get out of here!
Terramar: But we haven't found Silverstream! We can't leave yet!
[cockatrices hiss]
Starlight Glimmer: Well, we can't stay here! Come on!
[cockatrices hissing]
[leaves rustling]
[cockatrice clucks]
Starlight Glimmer: [screams]
[cockatrices hissing]
Starlight Glimmer: This way!
[cockatrices hiss]
[doors open]
[doors close]
[thudding]
Trixie: Now what?!
Sunburst: Let's hope Silverstream found a good place to hide. There could be hundreds more cockatrices on the way. If this really is a migration, it'll take a full lunar cycle to complete.
Terramar: Ohhh. I have to get word back to our parents that Silverstream could be surrounded by those terrifying birds!
Maud Pie: [deadpan] And as handsome as Mudbriar is now, we should probably catch one of them to turn him back to normal.
Starlight Glimmer: [groans] This is all my fault. I'm never taking time off from my counseling duties again.
Trixie: That seems a little extreme.
Starlight Glimmer: Really?! If I hadn't galloped off to a holiday celebration, Silverstream would be safe with her family, and you'd all be enjoying Maud's party! Instead, my student is missing, we're surrounded by a flock of petrifying chicken-snakes, and Maud's boyfriend was turned into a hunk of rock!
Maud Pie: [deadpan] You got the "hunk" part right.
Starlight Glimmer: And to top it off, we have no idea if Silverstream even came to Everfree at all! But I have no idea where else to look!
Trixie: Has that always been there?
Starlight Glimmer: What? Oh, that's the students' treehouse. Apparently it grew from the Tree of Harmony and— [gasps] Of course! That should've been the first place we looked!
[scraping]
[door opens]
Starlight Glimmer: [sighs, gasps] Silverstream, look out!
Silverstream: Counselor Starlight, no!
Edith: [hisses]
Silverstream: Wait!
[magic humming]
Edith: [clucking softly]
Silverstream: This is Edith. She's helping me with my project.
Starlight Glimmer: I... don't understand.
Silverstream: After you encouraged me to solve my own problem, I decided to get my project done before I left. That way, I could really focus on my family during my visit. The school was closed, so I came here.
Terramar: Why didn't you tell anyone? Mom and Dad are worried sick!
Silverstream: Oh, no! I'm so sorry! Once Edith volunteered to help, I guess I lost track of time. Cockatrices are really friendly if you know how to interact with them.
Edith: [clucking softly]
Sunburst: I can't believe you figured out how to trigger her nesting response.
Silverstream: They are really fascinating creatures. Did you know that they migrate to the Everfree Forest once a year? Can you imagine what would happen if you stumble on a whole flock of these?
Starlight Glimmer: I have a few ideas.
Silverstream: [gasps]
Silverstream: I'm sorry you got turned to stone looking for me. But I'm glad Edith was able to turn you back.
Sunburst: [hushed, to Trixie] How do you tell the difference?
Maud Pie: [deadpan] I have mixed feelings about it.
Mudbriar: Technically, I will always be a stick pony. But the experience has given me an even deeper appreciation for the density and permanence of rock.
Maud Pie: [deadpan] Swoon.
Terramar: Silverstream and I should get going. But I wanted to thank you for everything you did to help find her.
Starlight Glimmer: I just wish I hadn't abandoned her in the first place.
Trixie: Starlight, you didn't abandon her.
Starlight Glimmer: I might as well have. Even though it turned out all right, things could've been a lot worse.
Sunburst: You can't be expected to supervise your students every second of every day.
Starlight Glimmer: I'm not so sure.
Silverstream: I like that you're always available, but it kind of makes it okay to come to you with stuff that maybe isn't super important.
Trixie: Of course being a school counselor is a big responsibility. But always being at work isn't fair to anypony. Especially me.
Starlight Glimmer: Do you think if I had set times to see me, it might help you decide what you really need to talk about?
Silverstream: To be honest, you really weren't very helpful with the other stuff anyway.
Starlight Glimmer: Yeah— Wait, what?!
Trixie: Happy Spring Solst-astic, everypony! Who wants a piece of Mrs. Cake's famous—?
[clang!]
Sunburst: Petrified dessert?
Maud Pie: [deadpan] You had me at "petrified".
All except Maud Pie: [laughing]
