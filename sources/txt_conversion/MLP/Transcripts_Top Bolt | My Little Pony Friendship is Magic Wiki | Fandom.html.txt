[locker door opens]
Rainbow Dash: Spring training was awesome, but I can't wait to see my friends!
[locker door closes]
Rainbow Dash: I'm gonna catch up on some Daring Do with Twilight, help Applejack make my favorite cider, and have a sleepover with Pinkie!
Misty Fly: We get it. You have a fun week planned.
Spitfire: Meanwhile, I'm stuck here running trials week at the Academy.
Rainbow Dash: But you love yelling and blowing your whistle.
Spitfire: Yeah. I do.
Rainbow Dash: See you gals later!
[whoosh]
Rainbow Dash: [chuckles]
[whoosh]
Rainbow Dash: [sighs]
[cutie mark ringing]
Rainbow Dash: Huh? Oh, the map!
Rainbow Dash: Hey, Twilight! So where am I going? The Crystal Mountains? Vanhoover? Here? Please say here.
Twilight Sparkle: Well, the good news is we both got called by the map!
Rainbow Dash: Awesome! [beat] Does that mean there's bad news?
Twilight Sparkle: No. Well, not exactly.
Rainbow Dash: [groans] I was just there!
[theme song]
[whoosh]
Twilight Sparkle: Ooh!
Rainbow Dash: Ahem.
Spitfire: All right, newbies! Welcome to trials week for the Wonderbolt Academy! You'll be judged on your speed, strength, agility, and technique, culminating in a final evaluation. Will it be hard? Yes! Will you cry? Maybe. Will you fly so much your wings fall off? That has only happened once.
Angel Wings: She's just exaggerating to make a point, right? I mean, wings can't really fall off... can they?
Spitfire: You think you've got what it takes to be an elite flyer?
Sky Stinger: Yes, ma'am.
Rest of recruits: Yes, ma'am!
Spitfire: Well, lemme tell you. You don't!
Rainbow Dash: [sighs wistfully] I remember when she said that to me.
Recruits: [muttering in awe]
Angel Wings: You don't think Rainbow Dash is the pony whose wings fell off, do you?
Spitfire: [blows whistle] Quit your whispering and give me five hundred laps! Go, go, go!
[whooshes]
Angel Wings: Um, I just wanted you to know, you two are my favorite ponies in all of Equestria.
Spitfire: Well, isn't that sweet? Now get going on those laps!
[whoosh]
Spitfire: Welcome, Princess Twilight. [to Rainbow Dash] What are you doing back so soon?
Rainbow Dash: Official friendship business.
Twilight Sparkle: Have you noticed anypony having a hard time with their friends?
Spitfire: Not really, but it's not my job to worry about their relationships. I'm here to make them elite flyers.
Rainbow Dash: [sighs] Adorable. They're so full of hope and competition. Eh, their technique could use some work, though.
Twilight Sparkle: You should tell them. I'm sure they'd appreciate any notes from you.
Rainbow Dash: Nah. I wouldn't want to mess with their confidence.
Twilight Sparkle: But they'll never get better if they don't know what to work on.
Spitfire: Sloppy wing placement, crooked lines... I'm gonna have to drill them on basic technique in the classroom portion.
Twilight Sparkle: Classroom portion?
Spitfire: Yeah, it's everypony's least favorite part of trial week, but it has to be done.
Twilight Sparkle: Maybe we can help!
Rainbow Dash: We can?
Twilight Sparkle: Absolutely! Between your flying skills and my teaching expertise, they could learn a lot! Plus, once they get to know us, they'll be more comfortable coming to us with their friendship problems!
Rainbow Dash: Count us in!
Spitfire: Great! [blows whistle]
[whooshes, thud]
Spitfire: You have your work cut out for you.
Twilight Sparkle: Thank goodness I had time to whip up a few charts on flight patterns and wing symmetry! It's fresh in my mind from when I learned to fly! This is so exciting!
Rainbow Dash: Maybe for you. I practically fell asleep when I went through this. Tell you what. I'll leave the teaching stuff to you, and I'll just make sure they stay awake! [blows airhorn]
[Twilight's ears ringing]
Twilight Sparkle: I'm pretty sure their thirst for knowledge will keep them bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
Rainbow Dash: [chuckles] Good one, Twilight.
[door opens]
Rainbow Dash: [blows airhorn]
Recruits: [gasping]
Rainbow Dash: Wake up, newbies! Class is in session!
Twilight Sparkle: Hello, students! I'm Twilight Sparkle, and this is Rainbow Dash.
Rainbow Dash: But you can call us "T-Sparks" and "The Dashinator"!
Twilight Sparkle: [clears throat]
Rainbow Dash: [laughs nervously] Just kidding.
Twilight Sparkle: And we're here to go over basic flying technique.
Sky Stinger: [groans]
Rainbow Dash: Who said that?!
Sky Stinger: Me. I mean, we're here because we're amazingly awesome crazy-good flyers. We're way past basics.
Rainbow Dash: What's your name?
Sky Stinger: Sky Stinger. You've, uh, never heard of me?
Vapor Trail: He set the record for the fastest vertical acceleration rate! Five hundred feet in two seconds!
Rainbow Dash: [unimpressed] Huh. That's pretty impressive.
Vapor Trail: It's amazing.
Twilight Sparkle: [clears throat] It is, and we can talk personal records after class, Ms...?
Sky Stinger: Vapor Trail. She's my wingpony. I never fly without her.
Rainbow Dash: But you'll have to in the solo trials.
Vapor Trail: There are... [gulps] ...solo trials?
Rainbow Dash: Yup. It's a part of your final evaluation.
Sky Stinger: [scoffs] We'll ace that test with our wings tied behind our flanks. My picture will go right up there, next to yours.
Rainbow Dash: That's a mighty big claim, considering everypony here is an amazingly awesome crazy-good flyer.
Sky Stinger: I know.
Twilight Sparkle: [clears throat] Okay! Let's get back on track. Now, who can tell me the best wing angle to achieve minimal air resistance?
Rainbow Dash: [snoring]
Twilight Sparkle: [blows airhorn]
Rainbow Dash: [quickly] Wake up newbies! Class is in session!
[door opens]
Recruits: [chattering]
Twilight Sparkle: Well, there were a few hiccups, but overall, that went pretty well.
Rainbow Dash: [cricks neck, yawns] Yeah, nopony fell asleep. What? I'm not a student!
Sky Stinger: Hey, Teach!
Rainbow Dash: Me or Twilight? Probably Twilight.
Sky Stinger: Um, uh, both. About the solo test. I'm actually kinda worried about it.
Twilight Sparkle: Aw, that's all right. We all have moments where we doubt ourselves.
Sky Stinger: No, no. I've absolutely zero doubts about myself. I'm a strong flyer. Like, really, really, really strong. This isn't about me. I'm worried for Vapor.
Twilight Sparkle: Oh, well, that is very... kind of you?
Rainbow Dash: Tell you what. It's almost time for your freestyle training. Why don't you grab her and show us what you got?
Sky Stinger: Yes! Prepare to be impressed!
[whoosh]
Sky Stinger: By me.
[whoosh]
Sky Stinger: Like I said, Vapor still needs work.
[whoosh]
[whooshing]
Twilight Sparkle: Well, he may be full of himself, but I have to admit, Sky is an excellent flyer. He must have shot up two hundred feet!
Rainbow Dash: But did you see Vapor Trail? Her wing was under his. I think she gave him a boost.
Twilight Sparkle: I guess I didn't even notice Vapor. I was too busy watching Sky.
[whooshing]
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] I think you're right! Vapor just created a gust of wind that caught Sky's wing at a forty-five degree angle, propelling him into a flipping loop! [beat] Somepony paid attention in class!
Rainbow Dash: Sky obviously has no idea he's not actually amazingly awesome.
Twilight Sparkle: And Vapor's so busy making her friend look good, she's not focused on her own flying at all. [gasps] This must be our friendship problem! And there's only one thing to do!



Rainbow Dash:
Fix it without telling them.


Twilight Sparkle:
Tell them the truth.

[distant whooshing]
Twilight Sparkle: You don't want to tell them?
Rainbow Dash: Of course not! Flying is like thirty percent skill and seventy percent confidence! You can't mess with a flyer's confidence!
Twilight Sparkle: But you can't improve if you don't think you have to! Besides, Vapor's keeping a pretty big secret from Sky, and that could lead to trouble!
Rainbow Dash: Yeah, but if we tell them that they've been holding each other back, that could be trouble too!
Sky Stinger: Ah, I nailed that flipping loop. I'm actually surprised you're still here. Thought I blew you away.
Vapor Trail: [out of breath] You were... great, Sky.
[thud]
Spitfire: Come on, Vapor Trail! You're gonna have to build up your endurance if you want a shot at the Academy! Wonderbolts don't get winded! Angel Wings, you call that cloud-busting?! That cloud barely knew you were there! I love my job.
Sky Stinger: We'll keep working, and who knows? One day, you might come close to being almost as good as me.
Vapor Trail: Oh, I don't think so. You were voted Stratusburg's most promising flyer! I was voted best sneeze. [sneezes]
Sky Stinger: You do have a really great sneeze.
Vapor Trail: Thanks, Sky, but I don't think I can sneeze my way into the Academy. [sighs] I'm pretty beat. I'm gonna hit the showers.
Sky Stinger: You have to help her.
Twilight Sparkle: Actually, she's not the oneâ€”
Rainbow Dash: Will do!
[locker opens]
Rainbow Dash: Hey, you did great. You're a really strong flyer.
Vapor Trail: Uh, me?
Twilight Sparkle: Vapor Trail, we know what you've been doing.
Rainbow Dash: You've been doing great!
Twilight Sparkle: [groans] You've been helping Sky!
Vapor Trail: Uh, I don't know what you're talking about! Sky doesn't need anypony's help. He's amazing.
[poink poink]
Rainbow Dash: [sighs] Not without you. And it's gonna be pretty obvious during the solo trials when he can't get enough air to do a flipping loop.
Vapor Trail: Oh, no! I can't let that happen! I mean, ah, uh... Aw, sugarcubes!
Twilight Sparkle: Why are you doing this for him?
Vapor Trail: [sighs] It started when we were kids. You have to understand...
Vapor Trail: [narrating] ...Sky grew up with a lot of siblings. It was tough. He was always trying to get his parents' attention. Meanwhile, I was an only child who hated all the attention I got from mine.
"Twirly Whirly": Vapor Trail! Where are you? Do you need a snack? Do you wanna do homework?
"Steer Straight": Or we can just spend some time together! All day is never enough!
Young Vapor Trail: [sighs]
Young Sky Stinger: Mom, Dad, I'm here! Look, look, look-look-look-look, hey! Mom, Dad, can you see?
[wind blowing]
[whooshing, baby crying]
Young Sky Stinger: [sighs]
Young Vapor Trail: Whoa, that was amazing!
[whoosh]
Vapor Trail: [narrating] Flying together gave us both what we wanted! But I never told Sky how much I was helping him. It started with a small boost here or a little gust of wind there, but I didn't think my help could actually hurt his chances.
Twilight Sparkle: I understand. But now you're both in trouble!
Rainbow Dash: You need to work on your tricks, and Sky needs to be able to fly without you or he won't make it.
Vapor Trail: Oh, but he has to! Flying with the Wonderbolts has been Sky's dream ever since he was a colt!
Twilight Sparkle: What about you?
Vapor Trail: I... I guess I haven't thought about it. I just want to be with my best friend.
Rainbow Dash: Then we have to find a way to help both of you.
Twilight Sparkle: Starting with telling Sky the truth.
Vapor Trail: No, you can't! Sky will be crushed! And without his confidence, he won't fly as well!
Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] Then I guess we'll give Dash's method a shot.
Rainbow Dash: Yes! Hah-hah! I love being right! Okay, here's what we do. Sky needs to build his strength. Air drills, wing lifts, all that boring methodical stuff.
Twilight Sparkle: Sounds like my cup of oats.
Vapor Trail: But how will we get him to do that? He doesn't think he needs practice.
Rainbow Dash: We'll just tell Sky that he should practice with Twilight so you won't feel so self-conscious about getting special training from me.
Vapor Trail: With you? Really?! You'd do that for me?
Rainbow Dash: Hah. You say that like it's not gonna be a blast.
[montage music]
[thud]
Vapor Trail: Whooa... Ah!
[clang, clang, clang, clang]
[whooshing]
[wind blowing]
[tires screeching]
Rainbow Dash: Oh, you were awesome!
Vapor Trail: Really? Thanks! I can't believe I was able to keep up!
Rainbow Dash: That's the first nice thing I've heard you say about yourself.
Sky Stinger: Hey, can we switch now? I want to do tricks with Rainbow Dash!
Vapor Trail: You can't! I mean, uh, you're already so good at the fancy stuff!
Sky Stinger: Heh. And the basic stuff. [beat] You're right, I don't need to practice at all.
Vapor Trail: Um, maybe, Sky, you should...
Sky Stinger: I'm already the best and everypony's gonna know it when I'm asked to join the Academy tomorrow.
Vapor Trail: But not if you don't practice...!
Sky Stinger: Heh. I wouldn't be surprised if they asked me to become a Wonderbolt straight out of the trials. Boom, dream achieved.
Vapor Trail: [squealing] Sky, you're not as good as you think you are! [gasps]
[beat]
Sky Stinger: What did you say?
Vapor Trail: [sighs] Sky, I want you to get in as much as anypony, and you're amazing, but...
Sky Stinger: But what?
Vapor Trail: I've been... helping you.
Sky Stinger: [scoffs] Puh-lease! I don't need your help! Watch! [straining]
Rainbow Dash: Gyuh...
[thud]
Sky Stinger: [panting] How can you do this to me? Did you all know? Oh, great. So everypony but me knows I'm a joke. Was this your plan the whole time? To embarrass me?
Vapor Trail: What? No! Don't you know me at all?
Sky Stinger: I guess not, since it took me this long to find out you're a terrible wingpony!
Vapor Trail: [gasps] I can't believe you!
Sky Stinger: I can't believe I was ever your friend!
[whoosh]
Vapor Trail: Thanks a lot.
[Dizzitron whirring]
Rainbow Dash: Do you think they're still mad?
[beat]
Rainbow Dash: Yeah, they're still mad.
Twilight Sparkle: This is all my fault. If we'd just done things your way, maybe we could have avoided this whole mess.
Rainbow Dash: No, it's my fault. It hit me when I was watching Sky train with you. He wasn't even trying!
[Dizzitron whirring]
[thud]
Rainbow Dash: Oh, no. He's lost his confidence.
Spitfire: Do you want to tell me why one of my most promising students is flying like a balloon with a hole in it?!
Rainbow Dash: Uh, it's a long story, but we'll fix it.
Spitfire: Yes, you will. [blows whistle]
[thud]
Rainbow Dash: [groans] We really messed up, huh?
Twilight Sparkle: I have a plan.
Sky Stinger: [straining]
Twilight Sparkle: Hey, Sky. I thought I might find you here.
Sky Stinger: Well, apparently, I need a lot of practice. Guess I'm not the natural I thought I was.
Twilight Sparkle: No, you're not.
Sky Stinger: [sarcastic] Thanks. Good pep talk.
Twilight Sparkle: I wasn't a natural at friendship. But with some practice and help from my friends, I got better, and now I'm the Princess of Friendship!
Sky Stinger: So you're saying I can be the... Princess of Flying?
[whoosh]
Rainbow Dash: You know, you're really good. You're lead pony material.
Vapor Trail: Hm. That's sweet of you, but no. I couldn't handle all the attention.
Rainbow Dash: But you'll never become a Wonderbolt if you're too afraid to shine. That is what you want, right?
Vapor Trail: Well, not at first. I just wanted to be with Sky. But learning to do all those fun tricks with you? It made me realize this is something I want for myself!
Rainbow Dash: I was hoping you'd say that. Come with me.
Sky Stinger: What's she doing here?
Rainbow Dash: Sky, Vapor was never trying to steal your spotlight. She thought she was helping you.
Twilight Sparkle: And Vapor, you shouldn't have been so content to take a back seat.
Rainbow Dash: Now, you can either stay mad, or help each other and become two of the greatest flyers the Wonderbolt Academy has ever seen! [beat] Please pick the second option. I don't want Spitfire to be mad at me.
[whoosh]
[wind blowing]
Vapor Trail: You got this, Sky!
Sky Stinger: Focus on a cloud when you spin! It'll help you fly straight when you come out of it!
Vapor Trail: Uh-huh!
[whoosh]
[scribbling]
[whoosh]
[stopwatch ticking]
Vapor Trail: [whooping]
[tires screeching]
[whoosh]
Sky Stinger: Whoo, yeah! [laughs]
[tires screeching]
[whooshing]
Rainbow Dash and Twilight Sparkle: [cheering]
[tires screeching]
Recruits: [cheering]
Spitfire: Congratulations! You've both made it into the Wonderbolt Academy!
[flump]
Spitfire: Whatever you did, it worked. They still have a lot of potential. Who knows? They might even be better than you, Crash.
Rainbow Dash: [laughing] Okay, let's not get carried away.
Angel Wings: Um, I just wanted you to know, you two are my new favorite ponies in all of Equestria.
Rainbow Dash: Hey, I heard that!
Vapor Trail: I can't believe we did it!
Sky Stinger: You were great! Even though you can out-fly me, you can be my wingpony anytime.
Vapor Trail: Aw. [chuckles] And you can be mine.
[cutie marks ringing]
[doors open]
Rainbow Dash: [spine clicking]
[doors close]
Twilight Sparkle: Phew. It's good to be home.
Rainbow Dash: [sighs] You're telling me. Now we can finally catch up with some Daring Do, I can make cider with Applejackâ€”
[knocking]
[door opens]
Misty Fly: Dash! I've been looking all over for you! Wonderbolt emergency! We got to get back to HQ.
Rainbow Dash: You've gotta be kidding me! I was just there! [sighs]
[thud]
Twilight Sparkle: [laughing]
