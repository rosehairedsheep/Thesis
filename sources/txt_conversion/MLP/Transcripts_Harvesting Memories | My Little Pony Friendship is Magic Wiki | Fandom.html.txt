Spike: We just need you to get Twilight to remember some of her favorite times with you so this book can record them.
Starlight Glimmer: But it's a surprise gift for her coronation, and I know you're uncomfortable not telling the truth, soooo...
Applejack: It's true I ain't fond of lyin', but I think I can handle it in my own way.
Spike: Just to play it safe, let's practice our way first.
Starlight Glimmer: [imitating Twilight Sparkle] Oh, hi there, Applejack! It's always so great to see you! But why did you ask me to come out to the farm?
Applejack: Uhhh... You see, the thing is, I need you to, uh... check the apples? I-I mean, I definitely don't need you to reminisce about some memorable times with me for any kind of magical gift or anything! [laughs nervously] Nope!
Spike: Maybe it's better if I do the talking.
[theme song]
Twilight Sparkle: I'm not sure I understand, Spike. Why would Applejack need me to check the apples she's using for the coronation?
Spike: I'm sure she just wants everything to be perfect. Isn't that right, Applejack?
Applejack: Well, uh, yes. But I have to be honest, Twilight. I—
Spike: Speaking of honesty, what's your favorite time that Applejack was honest, Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle: Gee, Spike, that's an odd question. And there's been a lot.
Twilight Sparkle: [screams]
Applejack: Hold on! I'm a-comin'!
Twilight Sparkle: Applejack! What do I do?!
Applejack: Let go.
Twilight Sparkle: Are you crazy?!
Applejack: No, I ain't. I promise you'll be safe.
Twilight Sparkle: That's not true!
Applejack: Now, listen here. What I'm sayin' to you is the honest truth. Let go, and you'll be safe.
Twilight Sparkle: Yaaah!
Applejack: Listen, y'all. I thought I was just bein' honest when I said all those things. But somepony helped me realize I was actually bein' hurtful. So for that, I apologize.
Photo Finish: Zo! You don't think fashion is ridiculous?!
Applejack: Uh... Well, I, uh... I still don't understand it. But I appreciate how much it means to y'all and how much hard work you put into it. I also know this contest is important to Rarity. So what do you say?
Applejack: I hate to disappoint everypony, but there's no way Granny could have made that dive, because this tonic is a fake!
[crowd gasps]
"Jinx": But you gave it your stamp of approval!
Rainbowshine: Are you saying you lied?
Applejack: ...I am.
[crowd gasps]
Applejack: I didn't mean to! But everypony seemed so much happier, I couldn't bring myself to tell you when I found out the tonic wasn't real. I know it was wrong. I just hope, with time, I can win back everypony's trust.
Applejack: [laughs] I am pretty honest.
[chicken clucks]
Spike: Yup. But you weren't always that way, were ya?
Applejack: [nervous sound]
Twilight Sparkle: Oh, I've heard that story.
Granny Smith: Now apple blight is a serious disease!
"Doctor Spring Bud": [splutters] Did she say... apple blight?
"Open Heart": I think she said "gasket mites".
Granny Smith: And once your trunk turns red like this, the only thing to do is prune the branches.
Filthy Rich: [gasps] Oh, no! Granny!
"Open Heart": Did you say..."prune them branches"?
Granny Smith: Well, sure! What else you gonna do once the blight gets this bad?
[cloth moving]
[scare chord]
[doctors, nurses, and audience gasping]
Young Applejack: Everypony, just stop! This is all a big misunderstandin'! [pants] Actually... it's a big lie.
[cloth moving]
[doctors, nurses, and audience gasping]
Granny Smith: Big Mac?!
Filthy Rich: [gasps] Granny Smith?! What is goin' on here, Applejack?!
Granny Smith: That is a darn good question.
Young Applejack: [sighs] I'm not sure if I was worried that nopony was listenin' to my ideas or just nervous that I wouldn't be the one to end up runnin' the farm, but... I promised somethin' to Filthy Rich that I couldn't deliver, and I was too embarrassed to admit it.
Filthy Rich: So Granny was never sick?
Granny Smith: And there ain't no apple blighted ponies?
Young Big McIntosh: Nnnope.
Young Applejack: Those were all lies. A-And I thought if you found out, you'd stop doin' business with the farm. So I just kept tellin' more.
"Hippocratic Oath": So she's not a doctor?
Young Applejack: Please don't make Granny and the farm suffer for what I did! This whole thing is my fault.
Applejack: I reckon what really set me against lyin' was seein' how it affected my family. And you're about as close to family as a pony can get, Twilight. That's why I need to—
Spike: That's another thing I love about you, Applejack. Nopony loves her family more than you do. Right, Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle: Sure. The Apples are all pretty close.
Applejack: Found 'em!
Granny Smith: Aaa-choooo!
Applejack: Heh. Gesundhoof.
Granny Smith: Why, thank you, Applejack. I still can't believe it's been almost one hundred moons since our last family reunion. Aw, I remember it like it was yesterday.
Applejack: Well, you have been talkin' about it pretty much every day since then.
Granny Smith: Apple Bloom! How them RSVPs comin' along? Who's showin' their muzzle at the reunion?
Apple Bloom: Everypony!
Granny Smith: Everypony? [aside, to Applejack] Feathers on a goat. [to Apple Bloom] Are you sure?
Apple Bloom: Well, I got RSVPs from Apples from Yonder Hill, Hollow Shades, Galloping Gorge, Foal Mountain, Apples from Fillydelphia, Tall Tale Town, and all the Apples from Appleloosa!
Granny Smith: Guh?
Apple Bloom: Oh! And how could I forget? Manehattan! Babs is comin'! I get to see my favorite cousin!
Granny Smith: I think we're gonna need a bigger cider trough.
Applejack: Everypony knows all this stuff about me. But I have something to say—
Spike: Ah, just look at me rambling on and on! You brought Twilight here to check the apples, and we haven't even started. Come on, Twilight!
[door slams]
Starlight Glimmer: Applejack, are you trying to ruin the surprise?
Applejack: I don't see how I could. Spike won't let me get a word in edgewise!
Spike: I think—
Starlight Glimmer: The way Spike's getting Twilight's memories might seem dishonest, but it's working really well.
Applejack: Don't you think Twilight'll get a mite suspicious if I just stand around while Spike does all the talkin'?
Starlight Glimmer: I suppose you should say something, but it doesn't have to be a lie. You can talk about anything. We just need more memories.
[door creaks]
Applejack: What do you think?
Twilight Sparkle: I think I still don't know what I'm supposed to be checking. You and your family have been running this farm forever. You know apples better than I ever will.
Applejack: I, uh... I guess that's true. We have been on this farm for quite a while. This barn's been here a while, too. Though it almost wasn't.


[Applejack]
Yee-hoo!
Raise this barn, raise this barn
One, two, three, four
Together, we can raise this barn
One, two, three, four
Up, up, up, go the beams
Hammer those joints, work in teams
Turn 'em round quick by the right elbow
Grab a new partner, here we go
Apple family: Yeah!
Applejack: Come on, Apple family! Let's get to it! Wee-hoo!
[Applejack]
Raise this barn, raise this barn
One, two, three, four
Together, we can raise this barn
One, two, three, four
Finish the frame, recycling wood
Workin' hard, you're doin' good
Turn 'em round quick by the right elbow
Grab a new partner, here we go
Apple family: Yeah!
Applejack: Whoo-whee!
[Applejack]
Raise this barn, oh, raise this barn
One, two, three, four
Together, we can raise this barn
One, two, three, four
Slats of wood come off the ground
Hold 'em up and nail 'em down
Turn 'em round quick by the left elbow
Grab a new partner, here we go
Apple family: Yeah!
Applejack: Come on, Apples! Get 'er done!
[Apple Bloom]
Look at us, we're family
[Applejack]
Workin' together thankfully
[Apple Bloom]
We Apples, we are proud to say
[Applejack and Apple Bloom]
Stick together the pony way
[Applejack]
Bow to your partner, circle right
Get down if you're scared of heights
Forward back and twirl around
That barn's gonna be the best in town
Apple family: Yeah!
Applejack: Yee-haw! Attagirl!
Apple Bloom: Alright, let's get to it!
[Apple family]
Raise this barn, raise this barn
One, two, three, four
Together, we can raise this barn
One, two, three, four
[Applejack]
Take your brushes, young and old
Together, paint it, bright and bold
Turn 'em round quick by the left elbow
Grab a new partner, here we go
[Apple family]
We raised this barn, we raised this barn
Yes, we did
Together we sure raised this barn
Yes, we did
Being together counts the most
We all came here from coast to coast
All we need to strive to be
Is part of the Apple family
Apple Bloom: Yeah!
Twilight Sparkle: What made you tell that story?
Applejack: Um... I suppose bein' in the barn made me think of it. Is that weird?
Twilight Sparkle: Not any more than the way you used to do your chores.
Spike: I've never heard that story.
Twilight Sparkle: What are you talking about? You were there!
Applejack: I'm sorry, but I just couldn't let those spa ponies go another minute puttin' up with problems they didn't even know they had! Somehow they just got used to a huge bottleneck of ponies standin' around waitin'. An' I took one good look at that spa jam, and I knew I had to do somethin'! Sometimes the simplest things can just derail a whole operation. [babbles] Whether it's a leaky pipe or doin' too much laundry. You can't just stick to the same old way of doin' things and expect them to get better. [clucking] I mean, thinkin' you can is just plumb ridiculous. Right? [short laugh] It's funny when you realize the extra work they were doin' was actually makin' things worse!
[pigs squeal]
[pigs stampeding]
Applejack: I mean, I guess it's possible to get stuck in a routine where you're doin' all this extra stuff and not realize it, but I can't for the life of me think of how! [beat] Why are y'all starin' at me like that?
Spike: Oh, yeah! I don't know how I could've forgotten that. Come to think of it, for a down-to-earth farm pony, you are weird a lot.
Applejack: [reading] "And that's when the yellow birdie thought to himself, 'Hmm. My favorite little tree isn't such a little tree anymore.' So she sang her song, big and strong, and they all lived in that great, big tree happily ever after. The end."
Rarity: Applejack! Were you reading a bedtime story to... an apple tree?
Rarity: [in country accent] Who's our next model for the fashion show?
Spike: Um... "Apple... Jewel"?
Rarity: Who the hay is that?
[tango music]
Applejack: [high pitched voice] I hate to say I told ya so, Twilight, but I told ya so!
[Spike and Twilight gasp]
Applejack: It's a curse, I tells ya!
Apple Bloom: Huh? Hey! Who put pillows on this rake?
Applejack: [chuckles] Oh, I don't know. Maybe someone who really loves her little sister and doesn't want her to get an owie?
Apple Bloom: [growls]
Shining Armor: Applejack? What are you doing?
Applejack: Applejack? [laughs] Who's that? My name's Apple Chord, and I've got a couple of songs to play for ya. Clap your hooves if you know 'em! And a one, and a two, and a...
My love is like a barrel
A barrel full of hay
Applejack: I guess I can be just as peculiar as the next pony. But that's not what's goin' on here today.
Spike: Uh, because today you wanted Twilight to check over the apples for the coronation, right?
Applejack: Nnnope. And I think it's time I told you the truth.
[chicken clucks]
Applejack: Twilight, I have to be honest. The reason Spike gave you for comin' out to the farm today was a lie. It's just that things have been so hectic, what with savin' Equestria and planin' for the coronation. I just wanted to have a chance to reminisce with you for a bit.
Spike: [sighs]
Starlight Glimmer: [sighs]
[chicken clucks]
Twilight Sparkle: I'm happy to spend time remembering things we've done together. You don't have to make up some excuse for that. Let's see... My favorite Applejack memories...
Twilight Sparkle: My name is Twilight Sparkle—
Applejack: Well, howdy-doo, Miss Twilight, a pleasure makin' your acquaintance. I'm Applejack. We here at Sweet Apple Acres sure do like makin' new friends!
Twilight Sparkle: Friends? Actually, I—
Applejack: So, what can I do you for?
Spike: [snickering]
Applejack: Keep pushin', Caramel. That's it, Bumpkin. I know it's hard work, but you guys are doin' great. Yee-haw!
Twilight Sparkle: Hey, Applejack. How's everything going?
Applejack: Oh, just dandy. A little slow startin', but peachy all the same. There's a lot of ground to clear, ya hear? We can't even start the plantin' and the waterin' until we git all these heap a' snow hightailed outta here.
Twilight Sparkle: Well, I'd like to help.
Applejack: Well, I... I dunno Twilight.
Twilight Sparkle: Just give me a chance.
Applejack: Well, I never turn down a hard worker, but...
Twilight Sparkle: [struggle] Ugh... [struggle] Ugh... [gasp]
Spike: Think of how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.
Twilight Sparkle: I could use a come-to-life spell. Hwww... Here goes...
Applejack: Hmm. She's awful strong for such a little pony.
Spike: That's my girl, following my advice.
Applejack: And what in tarnation does that mean?
Twilight Sparkle: [gasp] Uh-oh. Slow down. Slow down!
Spike: [yelp]
Spike and Applejack: Whoa-oa-oa!
Applejack: What's going on? Wha'd'ya do? You used magic, didn't you?
[doors close]
Queen Chrysalis: [laughing] It's funny, really. Twilight here was suspicious of my behavior all along. Too bad the rest of you were too caught up in your wedding planning to realize those suspicions were correct! [laughing]
Applejack: Sorry, Twi. We should've listened to you.
Twilight Sparkle: It's not your fault. She fooled everypony.
Twilight Sparkle: You've always been such a good friend. I don't know what I would have done without you.
Applejack: I feel the same way. If I hadn't met you, I might not have ever left the farm or had any adventures at all.
[city noises]
Rarity: Oh, Manehattan, what you do to me!
Applejack: [gulps]
Rarity: Darling, are you all right?
Applejack: Ponies move so fast here. Not at all like back home. [to herself] Eyes peeled, ears open. Eyes peeled, ears open.
"Rivet": [blows police whistle]
Rarity: Remember, Applejack, you're in the big city now. No moseying. You've gotta walk with speed and confidence!
"Rivet": [blows police whistle]
Rarity: Yoo-hoo!
Applejack: [snorts]
Diamond Cutter: Move it!
Applejack: Sorry 'bout that.
Strawberry Ice: Ah, get outta my way!
Applejack: Sorry.
Pedestrian Ponies 3 & 4: Watch it!
Applejack: Hey— Oh, dear. Butter my biscuits. I can barely cross the street in this town.
[train chugging]
[brakes hiss]
[train chugging]
[wind whistling]
Applejack: Guess nopony else is goin' out as far as we are.
Fluttershy: Maybe they know something we don't?
Applejack: Now, Fluttershy, I've told you a dozen times. There's nothin' to be sca—
"Loose Tracks": [screams]
Applejack and Fluttershy: [scream]
"Loose Tracks": I'm sorry.
Fluttershy: [screams] You really startled us.
"Loose Tracks": Oh, it's just that I'm not used to seeing anypony taking the train to... [ominously] the end of the line. The final destination. The last stop!
Applejack: We get the picture. Why?
"Loose Tracks": Nothing but uncharted terrain and wild beasts out that way. [maniacal laughter]
Applejack: Well, maybe there's a little somethin' to be scared of.
Chimera: [growls, bleats, and hisses]
Chimera's tiger head: Where are the pies?!
Chimera's snake head: They're not back here.
Chimera's goat head: This is your fault! You think you've always got to be in charge!
Chimera's tiger head: [sighs] You're lucky, you know? You've got no idea what it's like to have a sister constantly looking over your shoulder!
Apple Bloom: Uh, actually...
Chimera's goat head: Let's try listening to me for a change! And I say, if there are no pies, let's settle for the filly filet!
Chimera's snake head: [hisses] Any lassst wordsss?
Apple Bloom: I really wish my sister were here!
Applejack: Hang on, Apple Bloom! I'm a-comin'!
Chimera's tiger head and goat head: Get her!
Chimera's goat head: Hey! I thought I was in charge now!
Chimera's tiger head: [growls]
Applejack: [plays snake charming flute]
Chimera's snake head: [hisses]
Chimera's tiger head: [growls] [roars]
Applejack: Howdy!
[stretching noise]
[smash]
Twilight Sparkle: I feel pretty lucky we're friends.
Applejack: Honestly, so do I.
Twilight Sparkle: But you were right about the coronation keeping me busy. Come on, Spike. Celestia and Luna want to go over the guest list. Again.
Starlight Glimmer: Guess Spike and I should've let you handle things from the start.
Applejack: I may be an honest pony, but even I know how to not spoil a surprise.
[chicken clucking]
