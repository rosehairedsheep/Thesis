[animal sounds]
Fluttershy: Eloise, Hubert, we've barely practiced for the coronation at all today. How can you be tired already?
[swans honking]
Fluttershy: Any luck with the rest of the flock, Josephine?
[doves cooing]
Twilight Sparkle: Hi, Fluttershy. Did you still want me to see the rehearsal?
Fluttershy: I do, but I don't know what's gotten into everyone. Getting them to practice has been a real challenge. And the choreography for the coronation is very specific. I hope we have enough time to get it all down.
Twilight Sparkle: I'm sure that whatever you have planned, there's no pony better for the job than you.
Fluttershy: I hope so. At least Angel seems to have a handle on the butterflies and hummingbirds.
[hummingbirds humming]
Angel: [angry chitter]
Fluttershy: Or maybe not. [sighs]
[theme song]
[animal sounds]
Fluttershy: I'm already nervous about the performance, and this isn't helping. [sighs] I just don't understand why no one will listen.
Twilight Sparkle: Do you think the animals might be picking up on your stage fright? I remember how much of an issue that's been for you.
Rarity: Fluttershy, I cannot believe your spectacular voice isn't part of the Pony Tones quartet!
Fluttershy: Um, well, I—
Rarity: Especially since you're having us perform for your Ponyville Pet Center fundraiser tomorrow night!
Fluttershy: Well, you see, I—
Rarity: This simply must be rectified. You must share that stunning voice at the event!
Pinkie Pie: Yeah! It'll be so amazing! You'll be there on stage, basking in the hooflights! The center of attention! A shining star! Everypony staring at you, judging you, jealously noting how they could be way better than you! Why wasn't it them? Why wasn't it them? And then, when you choke, they'll turn on you, becoming a seething, angry mob, and you'll be horribly humiliated, never able to show your face in Ponyville again!
Rarity: Pinkie Pie!
[thwack]
Rarity: Don't be ridiculous!
Pinkie Pie: Aw, but I'm so good at it!
Rarity: [sighs] Come, Fluttershy, you will join the group, making the Pony Tones quartet the Pony Tones quintet!
Fluttershy: No.
Rarity: Pardon me?
Fluttershy: I love the Pony Tones, I'm one of their biggest fans, but I do not want to perform with them.
Twilight Sparkle: Why not, Fluttershy?
Fluttershy: Well, you see... I... I have... um... I... I have...
Rainbow Dash: Spit it out!
Fluttershy: I have... stage fright.
Twilight Sparkle: I can't believe that Princess Celestia chose us to put on the most important play of the season! Do you guys know what an honor this is? For all of us?
Fluttershy: Oh, I wish she hadn't honored me quite so much... I can't go onstage! I don't want everypony looking at me!
Rarity: Fluttershy, darling, there's nothing to feel nervous about.
Fluttershy: No?
Rarity: Of course not. All across Equestria, ponies are preparing their own pageants for Hearth's Warming Eve in their own towns. It's tradition.
Fluttershy: So you're saying they'll be too busy to come to our play?
Rarity: Well, no. We're in the Canterlot pageant, the biggest, most important production in all of Equestria. A lot of ponies will come to watch us.
Fluttershy: A lot?
Rarity: Hundreds.
Fluttershy: Hundreds?
Rarity: [gasps] Maybe even thousands!
Fluttershy: [yelps]
Fluttershy: I guess that might be why none of the animals are responding to me. I hoped having you here might inspire them, but...
Angel: [frightened chitter]
[doves cooing]
Fluttershy: ...that doesn't seem to be the case. I know I should get tough with them, but it's just so hard.
Twilight Sparkle: Being assertive doesn't exactly come easy to you, but you've gotten so much better at it.
Fluttershy: My dear Breezies, I had to rescue Seabreeze from serious harm, and now I know more than ever that you must leave before it's too late! You would never survive in Ponyville.
Breezies: Erski parli polin!
Fluttershy: I can't help you any more. In fact, I wasn't helping you at all by being nice. Oh... But the truth of the matter is that I must be firm! You must go, now! [sniffs] [crying]
[door closes]
Fluttershy: Please, just leave me alone!
Twilight Sparkle: Fluttershy, what's wrong?
Glasses Stallion: We want answers!
"Lemon Chiffon": Yeah! We're entitled to know!
Twilight Sparkle: What is it, everypony?
"Lemon Chiffon": We wanna know why Fluttershy keeps learning the same thing over and over again! Be assertive already!
"Wisp": Even I've learned more than she has! Why can't I be in the book?!
Starlight Glimmer: What? Really?! Are you attacking my friend because you want to be in a book?!
Fluttershy: It's okay. I got this, girls. [inhales] Listen up! I am more assertive! And yes, it took me a while to get there. But can you honestly say that you could learn something one time and completely change who you are?
[beat]
Fluttershy: I didn't think so.
Fluttershy: I have gotten better. Sometimes a little too much.
Globe Trotter: Excuse me, do you know how to get to the Ponyville tower?
Fluttershy: [muffled] Sure, you just– [gasps]
Globe Trotter: Oh, that's a shame.
Fluttershy: [growls] "You make me lose, I blow my fuse!"
Globe Trotter: Hey!
[bell ringing]
Fluttershy: [snooty voice] I wouldn't think it was possible to make something so dowdy even more matronly, but here you are. [goth voice] It's like a scream in the void, empty and ultimately meaningless. [hipster voice] I would srsly help you right now, but, like, I don't wanna, you know?
[smack]
[firefly squealing]
Fluttershy: Oh, goodness! Are you okay? [to the Mane-iac] Are you kidding me? I mean, I know you're evil and everything, but [getting frustrated] you hurt a teensy, little, harmless firefly?! Really?! Well you're just a great, big, meanie! [voice getting deeper] There! I said it! What makes you think you're so special?! Like the rules of common courtesy don't apply to you?! [voice getting even deeper] Why don't you pick on somepony your own size?! [roars]
[controls buzzing]
[laser firing]
Fluttershy: [roars]
Mane-iac: [yelps]
Fluttershy: [roaring]
[smashing noises]
Fluttershy: [spits]
Fluttershy: It's hard to figure out how assertive to be.
Twilight Sparkle: I'm sure you'll figure it out. When it comes to animals, you always do. Plus, you have Angel helping, so...
Angel: [angry chittering]
Fluttershy: [sighs]
Fluttershy: I'm sorry, Twilight, but I'm afraid at this rate, there won't be an animal performance for your coronation.
Twilight Sparkle: Have you thought about using the Stare?
Cutie Mark Crusaders: [scream]
[thump]
Cutie Mark Crusaders: [gasp]
Fluttershy: See? Now we have to—
Cutie Mark Crusaders: [screaming]
Fluttershy: Girls, please. Girls— now listen to me, girls, I— please!
[screaming]
[cockatrice squawking]
Fluttershy: Girls! Behind me, now!
[cockatrice squawking and roaring]
Fluttershy: You! Just who do you think you are, going around turning others into stone?
Cockatrice: [dismayed squawk]
Fluttershy: You should be ashamed of yourself. I have a mind to find your mother and tell her what you've been up to, young man. Now you go over there, and turn Elizabeak and my friend Twilight back to normal, and don't ever let me catch you doing this again. Do you understand me?
Cockatrice: [dismayed squawking]
Fluttershy: Are you girls all right? I was so worried!
Scootaloo: Yeah, fine!
Sweetie Belle: Thanks to that stare of yours.
Fluttershy: I don't know. The Stare is so... aggressive. Plus, it doesn't always work.
[flash bees buzzing]
Fluttershy: Hello, flash bees! I was hoping I could get some of your honey.
[flash bees buzzing]
Fluttershy: Oh! I see. You don't let others have any. Well, I'm sorry, but I really need it.
[zap]
Fluttershy: [squeaks] I didn't want it to have to come to this, but I'll just have to use... the Stare!
[flash bees buzzing]
[zap, zap, zap]
Fluttershy: [shrieks] [coughs] You really are aggressive!
Twilight Sparkle: To be fair, you were pretty sick then.
Fluttershy: Still, I find that I get the best results when my animal friends want to help me.
Fluttershy: [squeaks] [crying]
[squirrel chittering]
Fluttershy: [sniffles] Oh, thank you, but I'm afraid a couple of little acorns won't solve my big flying problem.
[duck quacking]
Fluttershy: I tried, but you should've seen those ponies laughing at me...
[birds chirping]
Fluttershy: I know it's important to have confidence in myself...
[badger squeaking]
Fluttershy: Yes, yes, I do remember. The river was swelling...
[badger squeaking]
Fluttershy: ...and you were scared...
[badger squeaking]
Fluttershy: ...yes, I did tell you to never give up... and to believe in yourself. You're right, my friends. I shouldn't give up. I will get my confidence up and show everypony that I am a good flyer! A great flyer!
[animal noises]
Fluttershy: Unfortunately, no one seems interested in helping me today. So I guess that means we won't be able to get our choreography down.
Twilight Sparkle: Come on! You can't all just abandon Fluttershy like this! Don't you want to stand by her? Think of all the times she stood up for you.
Fluttershy: You see? By fighting, you're destroying the very thing that brought you here in the first place! So it's time you both put your differences aside and come together! If not for yourselves, then for the sake of these cute and cuddly guys!
Twilight Sparkle: [straining]
Big Daddy McColt: Aw, shucks, we never meant to hurt you little critters.
Ma Hooffield: Yeah, we're sorry!
[squirrel chittering]
Fluttershy: They say they accept your apology.
Twilight Sparkle: And that's not even getting into all the other things that are so great about her.
Rainbow Dash: And once Pinkie and Rarity were saved, whoosh! Me and Fluttershy loop-de-loop around, and WHAM! Caught you right in the nick of time.
Twilight Sparkle: Yes, Rainbow, I was there, and I'm very grateful, but we gotta— [gasp] A manticore!
Manny Roar: [roar]
Twilight Sparkle: We've gotta get past him!
Rarity: Take that, you ruffian!
Manny Roar: [roar]
Rarity: My hair! Woop!
Fluttershy: Wait.
Manny Roar: [roar]
Applejack: YEE-HAW! Git along, little dogie.
Fluttershy: Wait.
Manny Roar: [roars]
Applejack: Whoa! All yours, partner.
Rainbow Dash: I'm on it.
Fluttershy: Wait!
Manny Roar: [roars]
Rainbow Dash: [screams]
Twilight Sparkle: Rainbow!
Manny Roar: [grunt]
Twilight Sparkle: [snorts]
Fluttershy: WAIT!
Manny Roar: [roar]
Fluttershy: Shhh... It's okay. Oh, you poor, poor little baby.
Rainbow Dash: Little?
Fluttershy: Now, this might hurt for just a second.
Manny Roar: [roar]
Everypony: Fluttershy!
Manny Roar: [purrs]
Fluttershy: [giggles] Aw, you're just a little ol' baby kitty, aren't you?
[winterzilla chomping]
Twilight Sparkle: No-no-no! Not that sparkly! This one!
[zip!]
Spike: [grunts] I'm okay if he doesn't want to chase me anymore!
Applejack: How are we gonna get rid of this thing?!
Discord: Oh, for Scorpan's sake!
[poof]
Discord: Hello?! If only one of you had a way with animals?!
Fluttershy: Oh, my.
[winterzilla growling]
Fluttershy: Uh... [clears throat] Excuse me.
[winterzilla roars]
Fluttershy: Whoa! This is supposed to be the happiest time of year! So if this is how you plan on behaving, you can march yourself right back to where you came from!
[winterzilla whimpers, sobs]
Fluttershy: Awww. Your family is gone for the holidays, and you're all alone?
[affirmative growl]
Fluttershy: I'm so sorry. If you calm down, I'm sure you could join us.
[swan honks]
Twilight Sparkle: I don't understand.
Fluttershy: Oh, it's not your fault, Twilight. You said some wonderful things. I even blushed a little. It's nice to know you think so highly of me, but you don't speak animal. I don't think they understood you.
Twilight Sparkle: [groans]
Fluttershy: I'm sorry I asked you to come all the way out here for nothing, Twilight. It's not like the routine was all that important. None of my ideas are. Not in the grand scheme of things.
Twilight Sparkle: Fluttershy, you and your ideas will always be important to me.
Twilight Sparkle: [snoring] 9-by-13-inch pan...
[thud!]
Fluttershy: Twilight!
Twilight Sparkle: [awake] Nonstick pans!
Spike: [groans] What's all the commotion in here, ladies?
Fluttershy: Sorry, but I figured out who the Mystical Mask is!
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] You did?!
Fluttershy: All I had to do was cross-reference a book about masks with another book on ancient Equestrian healers, then use a third book to translate it all from Olde Ponish, and there it was! Zecora was right! The Mystical Mask wasn't just a legend. The Mystical Mask was Mage Meadowbrook!
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps deeply] The ancient sorceress from Hayseed Swamp? We studied her at Celestia's school! Are you sure?
Fluttershy: Absolutely! Mage Meadowbrook wasn't just a sorceress. She was also a healer, and back then, healers wore masks so they wouldn't get sick themselves!
Twilight Sparkle: Fluttershy, I am so incredibly proud of you for using your research skills to figure this out!
Fluttershy: I'm glad you and I are such good friends.
Twilight Sparkle: Me, too. And even though things might be difficult right now, I want you to know how much you're appreciated.
Fluttershy: Thanks, but this coronation routine is just too difficult. I don't think I have the patience to round everyone up and try again.
Twilight Sparkle: [laughs]
Fluttershy: What's so funny?
Twilight Sparkle: I'm sure dealing with your animal friends is frustrating sometimes, but you've dealt with the most frustrating being in existence.
Twilight Sparkle: Release Princess Celestia and Princess Luna, and stop the Everfree Forest from invading!
Discord: Why, [chuckles] whatever are you talking about?
Applejack: Don't you play dumb with us, Discord! We know you're the one behind all of this!
Discord: Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love what you've done with the place, but I couldn't possibly take responsibility. I'm reformed, don't you remember?
Rainbow Dash: Yeah, right! This has got your cloven hoofprints all over it!
Discord: I'll have you know that I have only one cloven hoof. Such accusations. And here I thought we were friends.
Pinkie Pie: Drop the act, buster! We're onto you!
Discord: Ladies, ladies, I'm innocent. Would I lie to you?
Main cast sans Fluttershy: Yes!
Fluttershy: Um, maybe?
Discord: Well then, it seems we've reached an impasse. I'm telling the truth, but you think I'm lying. What do friends like us do in a situation like this, Princess Twilight? Congrats, by the way, on the promotion. You totally deserve it.
Rainbow Dash: I say we blast him back to stone!
Applejack: Works for me!
Rarity: Hear, hear!
Fluttershy: Hey! We can't do that! What if he really is telling the truth?
Discord: Well, finally! Somepony willing to give me the benefit of the doubt. The rest of you could learn a lot about friendship from my dear friend Shutterfly here.
Fluttershy: Um, it's Fluttershy.
Discord: Oh, right, whatever.
Discord: I suppose this is goodbye then. Have an absolutely fabulous voyage. [snap]
[magic zap]
Fluttershy: Discord...
Discord: [gasps] Well, it's not my fault the new train route leads into an active volcano. Guess you'll have to stay.
[beat]
Discord: Oh, you're no fun. [snap]
[party horn]
Discord: Bravo, ladies, bravo! How ever did you save the day this time? Blast the beastie with your magic necklaces, I presume? Where are those little trinkets of yours? You know, the ones you use to send me back to my extremely uncomfortable stone prison?
Applejack: [sigh] Gone.
Discord: Gone? Gone?
Fluttershy: But our friendship remains. And if you want to remain friends, you'll stop thinking whatever it is you're thinking and help us clean up.
Discord: Fine. But I don't do windows.
Twilight Sparkle: There's something fishy going on.
[splashes]
Fluttershy: Discord?
Discord: Well, it's hardly my fault if the soup tureen finds the term "something fishy" to be offensive.
Rarity: Not the dress! Not the dress!
[splashes]
Applejack: That tureen's only doin' what you're makin' it do!
Fluttershy: Now let's not jump to any conclusions.
Rainbow Dash: Fluttershy! Can't you see what he's doing? He's playing innocent with you so you'll never agree to use the Elements of Harmony against him!
[splash]
Discord: Oh, well, that's a bit harsh, isn't it?
Rainbow Dash: You see what I'm saying, right, Fluttershy? Fluttershy!
Fluttershy: You know what I see? I see that Discord's far from perfect, but I also see none of you giving him a chance!
Rest of main cast: [complaints]
Rainbow Dash: What's gotten into you?! Why do you keep cutting him so much slack?
Fluttershy: Because that's what friends do.
Discord: We're friends?
Fluttershy: Why, of course! I can't remember my house ever being this lively before you came along.
Discord: Oh... Well, I've... never really had a friend before.
Fluttershy: Well, now you do!
Fluttershy: Wow. You know what? You're right! Okay, everyone. I know none of you are feeling very motivated today, but we have a job to do, and I'm not gonna stop until it's done. The sooner you get on board, the sooner we can all take a break. So turn those wings around right now, and let's get started!
[acquiescing animal sounds]
Twilight Sparkle: Nice job, Fluttershy.
Fluttershy: I guess I just needed a bit of a confidence boost.
Twilight Sparkle: Meh. Some days are like that.
Fluttershy: But now you should probably go. I think it'll be more motivating for everyone if we keep the performance a surprise.
Twilight Sparkle: Well, whatever it is, I know it'll be perfect.
Angel: [inquisitive chitter]
Fluttershy: Yes, Angel. She's gone. You did a pretty good job too. You all did.
[happy animal sounds]
Spike: They're not the only ones.
[bushes rustle]
Fluttershy: Getting Twilight to believe my animal friends were giving me trouble was even easier than I thought. After that, it was simple to get her to reminisce about all the things we've been through together.
Starlight Glimmer: Collecting these memories for Twilight is really going well. I hope she likes the scrapbook.
Fluttershy: I'm sure she will, and I'm glad we could help.
[happy animal sounds]
Fluttershy: But now I think it's time we got some actual practice in.
[swan honks bitterly]
