Sassy Saddles: [panting] [muttering] Oh, I have to... Oh! I can't believe the winter-to-spring transition is almost here!
Rarity: [humming] Oh, I know. I love it so much, I gave it its own term – "Spring-sition"! [laughs]
Sassy Saddles: Ohhh. I like that. [sighs] I'm going to have to relabel all my binders. Right after we finish... everything! We still have so much to do! Oh, my bustles and bows! Rarity, did we—?
Rarity: Already hemmed, ruched, and cut, my dear.
Sassy Saddles: [sighs] Oh. Rarity, no reason to panic, but, um, we seem to be temporarily low! And when I say "temporarily low", I mean "completely out of"—!
Rarity: The baby blue sapphires? They arrived this morning.
Sassy Saddles: Oh. Heh. Wonderful. [sighs] Oh! What about the design for the—?!
Rarity: And done!
Sassy Saddles: Wow. You are good. And you've really outdone yourself this time! The Morning Sunshine Tulip Frock is gorgeous!
Rarity: Ooh, thank you. Look, I know you're worried about something slipping between the cracks. But with your managerial skills and my fabulous designs, we have everything covered.
Sassy Saddles: You're right. You're right. There are no cracks.
Rarity: Would you be a dear and fetch me some vermilion satin from the back? And I'll start on the Eternal Elegance Empire Silhouette evening gown.
Sassy Saddles: My most certain pleasure!
Rarity: Oh. I love this picture. When was the last time we had that kind of fun together? [gasps] Why, I can't remember! Has it been that long?! I guess I've been so busy running my shop! [gasps] Oh, no! Something, or should I say somepony, is slipping between the cracks! [sobs] I miss my Sweetie Belle! [sobs]
Sassy Saddles: Rarity, we're running low on vermilion satin.
Rarity: Huh? [bawls]
Sassy Saddles: I... I can order more!
[theme song]
Rarity: [continues bawling] And this is when we pretended we were storybook princesses. And here we pretended we were on a dangerous yet stylish safari. [sobs] So many wonderful memories! [sobs, blows nose, resumes sobbing] Not to put too fine a point on it, but... [bawls harder] Sweetie Belle loves playing dress-up. I miss her so much!
Sassy Saddles: Then why don't you go visit her?
Rarity: [through tears] I wish I... could, but... between... running... three stores and the spring-sition... I couldn't possibly...
Sassy Saddles: But you've already done almost all the work. I can handle the rest.
Rarity: B-B-But... but...
Sassy Saddles: Rarity, go. I have everything well in hoof.
Rarity: [sobs, calmer] Mm, point taken. [excitedly] I am going to visit my sister!
Sassy Saddles: Way to immediately turn that around.
Rarity: We can spend the whole day together! And we can do all her favorite things!
Sassy Saddles: I'm sure she'd love that.
Rarity: Oh, Sassy, thank you!
Sassy Saddles: Of course! Now get out of here!
Rarity: I'm going! I'm going! Hang on, sis! I'm coming!
Cutie Mark Crusaders: [giggling]
Starry Eyes: [screams]
Scootaloo: Excuse us!
Apple Bloom: Comin' through!
Sweetie Belle: Cutie Mark Crusaders mid-mission here!
Cutie Mark Crusaders: [giggling, screaming]
[crash!]
Scootaloo: That was fun! Let's do it again!
Sweetie Belle: Scoot, we've got a job to do.
Scootaloo: Later?
Sweetie Belle: All right, Chipcutter. We've done our part. The rest is up to you.
Chipcutter: You really think I have it in me to be a sculptor?
Scootaloo: Yup!
Chipcutter: But why?
Sweetie Belle: Because you said you weren't good at anything except getting in trouble for making sculptures out of your lunch, right?
Chipcutter: Yeah. I can't help it. When I look at my sandwich, it's like it's just asking me to... turn it into a dragon.
Apple Bloom: Well, what is this slab asking you to turn it into?
Chipcutter: Hmmm... I see...
[jackhammering noises]
[crumble]
Apple Bloom: Wow! T-That's incredible! It looks just like us!
Scootaloo: We knew you had it in you, Chip!
Chipcutter: This is way better than sandwich sculpting!
Sweetie Belle: Chip, we're proud of you.
[flash]
Chipcutter: I finally got my cutie mark!
Apple Bloom: Woo-hoo! All right!
Scootaloo: Yes!
Sweetie Belle: Way to go!
[hoof-bump]
Scootaloo: [sighs] Not a bad way to start a day.
Apple Bloom: Not a bad way at all! Helpin' ponies is just about my favorite thing to do.
Sweetie Belle: Another satisfied client!
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo: Mm-hmm!
Apple Bloom: So who's up next?
Sweetie Belle: Pretty sure it's Zipporwhill. She needs help reconnecting with her cutie mark – three puppy paw prints.
Scootaloo: When is she swinging by?
Sweetie Belle: Well, I think she should be arriving right about...
[door opens]
Sweetie Belle: ...now.
Apple Bloom: Wow. You are good.
Sweetie Belle: Come on in, Zipporwhill.
Scootaloo: Okay, so what seems to be the problem, exactly?
Zipporwhill: It's my puppy, Ripley. We used to be so close. In fact, I got my cutie mark the day I found him and took him home. But now, it's like he wants nothing to do with me.
Scootaloo: Don't you worry. You've come to the right place! The Cutie Mark Crusaders are on the job!
Apple Bloom: Trust us. Before you know it, you and your puppy will be back to bein' besties!
Sweetie Belle: You have the CMC guarantee! No matter what it takes, we promise you'll have our full attention.
Rarity: [singsongy] Guess who's here to spend the whole day with her little sister?!
Sweetie Belle: [gasps] Rarity? [grunts]
Rarity: Mmmm!
Sweetie Belle: [laughs nervously]
Rarity: [to Zipporwhill] Oh! Heh-heh. So sorry, dear. You're tiny. I didn't even see you there! Tend to get carried away with my entrances! Ta-da! [laughs]
Sweetie Belle: Rarity, what are you doing here?
Rarity: I am here to spend the day with you! I'm so excited, I could practically faint! You don't happen to have a fainting couch in here, do you?
Sweetie Belle: No!
Rarity: Oh, pfft, of course not. It's a treehouse! That would be très gauche!
Sweetie Belle: Right... Well, I sure am happy to see you, and spending the day with you does sound like a lot of fun, but... I'm kind of right in the middle of something important. I have responsibilities and...
Rarity: Oh.
Apple Bloom: Go on, Sweetie Belle. We've got this covered. How often do you get to spend time with your sister?
Scootaloo: Yeah! Go have fun.
Sweetie Belle: You sure you two can handle our client here?
Rarity: "Client"? Oh, that is so adorable!
Sweetie Belle: Uh, thanks? I think?
Rarity: [sniffs] Ooh! You have mints to offer your "clients". [giggles] How.. professional. [giggles]
Sweetie Belle: Are you sure you two got this?
Apple Bloom: We have it handled.
Rarity: Oh, my! Look at this wall of satisfied customers! [gasps] You girls really have come a long way.
Sweetie Belle: Well, all right then. [to the other Crusaders] But, lemme know if you need me or run into any trouble.
Rarity: Come on, come on! You'll never guess what I have planned! [squeals]
[foals and Rarity giggling]
Rarity: Ooh! So fun!
Sweetie Belle: [indignantly] What?
Rarity: [giggles] It's just I know how much you love these puppet shows.
Sweetie Belle: I did.
Rarity: Oh, it's just like old times! You, me, greasy popcorn. It's like no time has passed at all.
Zipporwhill: [struggling] Come on... [grunts]
Rarity: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! It's your favorite part!
[music and silly sound effects]
[foals and Rarity giggling]
Rarity: Banana peels are so very, very slippery! [laughs] It's funny because it's true! [laughs]
Sweetie Belle: [laughs nervously, sighs]
Rarity: What's the matter, darling?
Sweetie Belle: I, um, guess I just prefer black box experimental theater.
Rarity: What?! Since when?
Sweetie Belle: [sighs] I dunno. It's no big deal. This is great.
[bell dings]
Rarity: Okay. We're here! Ta-da! [laughs, clears throat] Aren't you excited to be back here again? Do I know my baby sister, or do I know my baby sister?
Sweetie Belle: Uh... Yeah... Where is "here" exactly?
Rarity: Oh, pfft! Stop being so silly! You know this is your favorite ice cream shop!
Sweetie Belle: Oh. Right. From when I was a little filly.
Rarity: And I convinced the original owner to come out of retirement to make you your all-time favorite dessert! [giggles, claps twice]
[tray drops]
Sweetie Belle: Huh. I remember it being much bigger.
Rarity: Well, go ahead. I know you're dying to dig in.
Sweetie Belle: [slurps, gulps]
Rarity: Well?
Sweetie Belle: [laughs nervously, sighs] That was, uh... one tasty bite. Still a little hungry, though.
Rarity: [gasps] We can get another sundae! Chocolate with rainbow sprinkles, perhaps?
Sweetie Belle: I was thinking something more like a salad.
Rarity: A salad? When did you get so practical?
Sweetie Belle: Oh, um... I guess another scoop would be fine!
Rarity: [gasps] One more Filly Clown Surprise, please!
[thump]
Sweetie Belle: [groans]
Ripley: [panting]
Zipporwhill: Hey, Ripley!
Scootaloo: Look at me! Over here!
[squeaking]
Ripley: [yawns]
[balloon squeaking]
Rarity: I know you must be bored, darling. This is a very long line for one of Twisty Pop's balloons.
Sweetie Belle: [groans]
Rarity: But just be patient. We'll get you your favorite balloon bouquet, and it'll all be worth it.
Zipporwhill: [baby noises] Who's a good puppy? Who's a good puppy?! You're the good puppy!
Ripley: [whines]
Zipporwhill: Now come on, puppy-wuppy! Get the bally-wally!
Scootaloo: Come on, Ripley! Like this!
Apple Bloom: Good Scootaloo! See?
Ripley: [barking]
Zipporwhill: [sighs] It's not working.
Scootaloo: Maybe if the ball tasted better?
Apple Bloom: I don't think that that's it, Scoot.
Sweetie Belle: Doesn't look like it's going so well. I'm just gonna do a quick check with the CMCs.
Rarity: Well, I guess duty calls, and-and you, you have that now...
Sweetie Belle: What?
Rarity: Oh nothing, nothing. Go on.
Scootaloo: Hey, Sweetie Belle. How's your day with Rarity going?
Sweetie Belle: Well, it's not exactly great...
Apple Bloom: What do you mean?
Sweetie Belle: I don't know. It's like Rarity doesn't even know me anymore.
Scootaloo: I wish we could say our day is going better.
Ripley: [barking]
Apple Bloom: But we can't.
Scootaloo: Seems like Zipporwhill's puppy doesn't want anything to do with her.
Sweetie Belle: Hmmm. I see what you mean... [gasps] You know, it's an awfully big puppy...
Rarity: Sweetie Belle, hurry! He's making it!
Sweetie Belle: Gotta go...
[balloons squeaking]
Rarity: [gasps] I know just what to do with this!
[fashion music]
Rarity: And pose!
[camera clicks]
Rarity: And pose!
[camera clicks]
Rarity: Love the camera!
[camera clicks]
Rarity: Hate the camera.
[camera clicks]
Rarity: Love it again!
[camera clicks]
Rarity: Sweetie Belle, you did "hate the camera" for all these shots! [sighs] Let's do it again.
Sweetie Belle: No!
Rarity: [gasps]
Apple Bloom: Come on, Zipporwhill, you can do this!
[squeaking]
Ripley: [sniffing]
Rarity: W-What do you mean, no?
Sweetie Belle: Rarity, this is hard for me to say, but... um...
Rarity: Sweetie Belle, what is it? You've been acting weird all day. You used to love doing these things with me.
Sweetie Belle: That's just it! I used to! That's not who I am anymore!
Zipporwhill: This isn't who I am! My cutie mark must be for something else, because my puppy just doesn't love me anymore! Hmph!
Rarity: But it is you! You love puppet shows and dressing up and taking silly photos and tiny little clown-shaped ice creams!
Sweetie Belle: Really?! If you still think I like doing this stuff, then maybe you don't know me at all!
Rarity: [whimpering]
Rarity: [sobbing] I can't believe Sweetie Belle talked to me like that. [indignant] And after everything I did to set up a whole day of doing her favorite things! I mean, accusing me of not knowing her?! I know her better than anypony! Um, thank you, Twisty, but the hard truth is, my sister is being unappreciative right now! And I'm going to go and give her a piece of my mind!
[balloon deflating]
Sweetie Belle: Hey, Zipporwhill. What are you doing here? Where are Apple Bloom and Scootaloo?
Zipporwhill: They're with my puppy. He seems to like them better than me anyway.
Sweetie Belle: Now, I'm sure that's not true.
Zipporwhill: It is. He doesn't like doing anything with me anymore. [sighs] He didn't even want to play with this. And all puppies love these. [sniffs]
[squeak]
Zipporwhill: [sniffing, crying]
Sweetie Belle: I think that might be your problem right there! Come on!
[squeak]
Ripley: [yawns]
Scootaloo: [groans] Find Zipporwhill, Ripley!
Apple Bloom: Woof, woof! It's Zipporwhill! Woof?
Scootaloo: [sighs] It's hopeless.
Apple Bloom: Sweetie Belle!
Scootaloo: Zipporwhill! [sighs] We're sorry we haven't figured this out yet.
Sweetie Belle: Don't worry, girls. I think I cracked this one.
Rarity: Aha! There she is! [gasps] Oh, dear. Really should have changed. [huffs] No matter! I'm going to give her quite the talking to! ...Right after she's done with her conversation. Anger is no excuse for poor manners, after all.
Sweetie Belle: Okay, Zipporwhill. What do you see?
Zipporwhill: My puppy?
Sweetie Belle: That's not what I see. I see a full-grown dog.
Zipporwhill: He did get bigger, I guess.
Sweetie Belle: He's not just bigger. He's older, too.
Ripley: [grunts]
Sweetie Belle: You don't still play with the same toys from when you were a foal, do you?
Zipporwhill: Oh. Ohhh. The squeaker is a little small for him now. [sighs] It's just hard for me to believe he's not the same adorable little guy I found anymore.
Sweetie Belle: I understand. But doing things like you used to won't turn him back into a puppy.
Zipporwhill: So... what do I do?
Sweetie Belle: Treat him like the dog he is, and find new favorite things to do together.
Zipporwhill: You think so?
Rarity: I know so!
Sweetie Belle: Rarity?!
Rarity: Oh, Sweetie Belle. I heard what you said, and you are so right.
Scootaloo: About the dog?
Rarity: Yes, but about us, too. The truth is, I know you're not a little filly anymore. But it's just... the last time we did all of those things together, I... I didn't realize it was gonna be the last last time. I loved doing those things with you. It's hard for me to let that go.
Sweetie Belle: Aww, Rarity! I love being with you too! That will never change! But... maybe we could just try to do different things together?
[clicking]
Ripley: [alerted dog noise] [panting]
Zipporwhill: What is it, puppy? [giggles] I mean, Ripley?
Ripley: [panting]
Zipporwhill: [giggling] I love you too, Ripley! Thank you, Crusaders.
Cutie Mark Crusaders: No problem!
Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Zipporwhill: [laughing]
Zipporwhill: Oh, Ripley!
Rarity: Sweetie Belle, I'm so very proud of the pony you've grown into.
Sweetie Belle: And I'm proud that no matter what, I'll always be your little sister.
Rarity: I, uh, have a little bit of time before I have to head back to Canterlot. Could we spend it together? What would a grown pony like you want to do?
Sweetie Belle: Well, I do have one idea...
Rarity and Sweetie Belle: [licking lips]
Rarity: Heh, I didn't realize your idea would be such a delicious one! [giggles] I don't know how I'm going to finish this.
Sweetie Belle: Oh! I'll help you!
Rarity: [giggles]
Sweetie Belle: [giggles]
