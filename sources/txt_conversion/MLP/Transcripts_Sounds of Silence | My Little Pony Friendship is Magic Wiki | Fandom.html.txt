Twilight Sparkle: I can't believe you two are going on a friendship quest! This is amazing!
Applejack: What do you mean, Twilight? We've been on one together before.
Twilight Sparkle: Exactly! This is the first time the map has teamed up the same ponies for a second quest!
Fluttershy: That is special.
Applejack: Heh. Must be 'cause we're extra good at solvin' friendship problems.
Twilight Sparkle: I hope so, 'cause it looks like this one might be a little tricky. You're going to the Peaks of Peril.
Fluttershy: The Peaks of... P-P-Peril?!
Applejack: Aw, it's just a name. It doesn't mean anythin'.
Fluttershy: Like how Cloudsdale is in the clouds and the Crystal Empire's made of crystal?
Applejack: Fair point. So, what can ya tell us about the place, Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle: Only what Rockhoof told me. Back in his day, nopony knew much about the Peaks of Peril except for the legend on this ancient shield. It says a group called the Kirin used to live there, known for their kindness and truth-speaking.
Applejack: Now we know why the Map called us.
Twilight Sparkle: Unfortunately, other creatures also lived there. The Nirik, fearsome beasts of pure fire.
Fluttershy: [shudders] Maybe you should go instead of me, Twilight. [laughs nervously]
Twilight Sparkle: Sorry, Fluttershy. Flanks don't lie.
[shimmering]
Applejack: Aw, I'm sure the two of us'll get that friendship problem solved, no matter what kind o' creature has it.
Fluttershy: [laughs nervously]
[theme song]
[train chugging]
[brakes hiss]
[train chugging]
[wind whistling]
Applejack: Guess nopony else is goin' out as far as we are.
Fluttershy: Maybe they know something we don't?
Applejack: Now, Fluttershy, I've told you a dozen times. There's nothin' to be sca—
"Loose Tracks": [screams]
Applejack and Fluttershy: [scream]
"Loose Tracks": I'm sorry.
Fluttershy: [screams] You really startled us.
"Loose Tracks": Oh, it's just that I'm not used to seeing anypony taking the train to... [ominously] the end of the line. The final destination. The last stop!
Applejack: We get the picture. Why?
"Loose Tracks": Nothing but uncharted terrain and wild beasts out that way. [maniacal laughter]
Applejack: Well, maybe there's a little somethin' to be scared of.
Applejack: Yah!
[squishing]
[Fly-ders buzzing]
Applejack: [groans]
[rocks crumbling]
[rustling]
Applejack: [panting] Those must be the Peaks of Peril. Whew. Tough goin', huh, Fluttershy—? Fluttershy? [groans]
Applejack: Yah! [grunts]
[squishing]
[Fly-ders buzzing]
Applejack: [groans]
Applejack: [pants]
[splash!]
[squirrel chittering]
Fluttershy: There. That should be enough flowers to keep your tree cozy.
Applejack: Fluttershy! What are you doin'?! This is no time for visitin' varmints! We're on a friendship quest, remember?!
Fluttershy: Yes, but actua—
Applejack: Come on! We're burnin' daylight!
Fluttershy: I know, but what I found out is that—
Applejack: Now, we gotta get up that peak! I figure if we use some rope and elbow grease, we can make it up half—
Fluttershy: Applejack! Can you please listen to me?! [clears throat] What I'm trying to say is the squirrels told me a shortcut they take to the Kirin village.
[grinding]
[rustling]
Applejack: Oh. [chuckles] Sorry, Fluttershy. I suppose I got a little too caught up in the adventure.
Fluttershy: That's all right. If you hadn't come back to get me, I probably would've talked to the squirrels all day. Heh.
Applejack and Fluttershy: [gasp]
Fluttershy: [giggles]
[rustling]
Fluttershy: I hope that's not a Nirik! [gasps]
Applejack: Show yourself!
Fluttershy: [shudders]
Applejack: Well, hi. I'm Applejack, and this here's Fluttershy.
[beat]
Fluttershy: If you have any friendship problems, we're here to help.
[beat]
Applejack: Huh. [to Fluttershy] Quiet bunch, ain't they? [clears throat] We're from Equestria, and we're plumb tickled to meet y'all.
[beat]
Applejack: S-So, uh... what are your names?
[beat]
Applejack: [stressing] Ap-ple-jack! Flut-ter-shy! Remember?
Fluttershy: [whispering, to Applejack] Maybe they don't understand us.
Applejack: [stressing] Do. You. Un-der-stand. Ponish?
[beat]
Fluttershy: Oh! But you don't speak?
[beat]
Applejack: Don't or won't?
Fluttershy: Will you excuse us for a moment? [to Applejack] You have to ask yes-or-no questions, or they won't answer.
Applejack: Like talkin' to Angel Bunny?
Fluttershy: Not exactly. I can always tell what Angel is feeling. But these Kirin don't show anything.
Applejack: Well, how are we gonna solve a friendship problem if none of 'em will tell us what it is?
Applejack: These Kirin are quieter than an apple blossom on snowfall. Still, there's gotta be some way to make 'em speak. [chuckles] Beautiful day, ain't it?
[beat]
Applejack: [whinny] Knock, knock! Now you say, "Who's there?"
[beat]
Applejack: Police. "Police who?" Police [please] say somethin'!
[beat]
Applejack: Uh-oh! I feel a sneeze comin' on! Aaaa-CHOOOOO!
[beat]
Fluttershy: Gesundheit.
Applejack: [groans] Don't any o' y'all talk?!
[beat]
Applejack: Now we're gettin' somewhere.
Fluttershy: A dark spooky path that leads into unknown territory?
Applejack: Tell you what, sugarcube. You stay and see if you can get anythin' outta these here Kirin. I'll go and try to find one that talks.
Fluttershy: Phew! Be careful. And watch out for Niriks!
[rustling]
Applejack: [yelps] Phew! [yelps] Oh. Have you seen a Kirin that talks?
[beat]
Applejack: Any idea where I should look?
[beat]
Applejack: Oh, for the love of Celestia! Can't ya just say somethin'?!
Autumn Blaze: [giggles] Gotcha! Sorry, sorry, but that was too good. Oh, you don't know how much I missed jokes. Hi-larity! Am I pronouncing that right? Some words I haven't said in a will. While! While. Hi, I'm Autumn Blaze. You've just arrived, and perhaps you're tired or hungry or reflective and want to sleep and eat and journal? Which you should do, of course! But first— Oh! Oh, what joy to talk with another creature! It's been so long! You must tell me everything about you! There's so much to say, so much to do! Oh, look at me. I'm going on, and you haven't seen— I mean, have you seen—? W-What am I saying? Of course you haven't. So just— I— yeah— I will j— Follow me!
[beat]
Applejack: That... was somethin', all right.
[wind whistling]
Applejack: Oh, wow. [gasps] This... is amazin'.
Autumn Blaze: Oh, you think so, too?! The way the light shimmers off everything, like, like it all suddenly woke up the moment you saw it. And you realize maybe the water and the mountains and the forest and the... yes, the rainbow and the stars and the sky are all looking back at you thinking the same thing? That we are a part of the everything. That maybe there's just one thing and we are all it.
[beat]
Applejack: I was gonna say it's pretty. But yeah.
Autumn Blaze: [hums, sniffs] Mmmm! And this is just the first stop on a journey of amazing things to see, smell, tiptoe through. Oh, I haven't been able to share all of this with anypony in forever! Since they all took that vow of silence. So it's a lot for me to pro-cess. Process? Uh, deal with.
Applejack: Whoa there. Vow of silence?
Autumn Blaze: That's, uh... That's why they asked me to leave.
Applejack: I hope it's not a sore subject, but... you mind explainin' why y'all went quiet in the first place?
Autumn Blaze: It's a long story.
Applejack: [sighs] You'd rather not talk about it?
Autumn Blaze: No.
Applejack: I-I under—
Autumn Blaze: [begins singing] I'd rather... siiiiiiiiiiiing!
[Autumn Blaze]
La, la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
The Kirin used to speak and sing
We weren't always quiet
We told stories and funny jokes
My stand-up was a riot
But then one day, a fight broke out
And hurtful words were said
Flaring tempers were inflamed
Destruction quickly spread
And flaming bred from head to head
It even burnt our... bread
Sorry, I forgot how much I love rhyming. Where was I? Oh, right!
My happy village lay in ruins
Relationships got worse
Spoiler alert: we quickly learned
That words could be a curse
"No more talking," yelled our leader
The last thing said aloud
Into the Stream of Silence
We stepped as a crowd
The water cooled emotions
And peace was soon restored
But with no way to speak my thoughts
I got super... bored
Seriously, there's only so long that Sudoku can keep you entertained!
'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky
Unless you let it rain
And shiny apples sometimes come with worms
No, you can't give up your laughter
'Cause you're scared of a little pain
It's a lesson that the Kirin never learned
I was stuck in silent prison
With the voices in my head
'Til I tripped over my salvation
In a helpful flowerbed
I found a cure to clear my pipes
And I became quite chatty
With years and years of stored-up words
I drove my village batty
They didn't like my jokes and songs
And daily dose of news
The plays I wrote, the speeches spoke
Variety revues
Or the story about the Kirin who hid below an opera stage
And fell in love with this opera singer, and he wore a freaky half-mask thing, and he played the organ a lot and got all broody 'cause the singer was in love with another dude, so he took her away on this underground gondola. I mean, who doesn't love musical theater?!
The village leader made it clear
I had to make my choice
I could stay and live with them
Or I could keep my voice
So I came here, but left the couch alone
They're hard to move
With just the view for company
Until ya heard me groove
Take it away, boys!
[beat]
'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky
Unless you let it rain
And candles just won't glow until they're burned
No, you can't give up your laughter
'Cause you're scared of a little pain
It's a lesson that my village never learned
No matter how hard I schooled them
Fear of hurt is still what ruled them
Sometimes you gotta let it raaaaaaaain!
Yeah, sometimes you've gotta let it rain
Applejack: [gasps] I can't believe it! Nopony should give up feelin'... their feelin's just to keep from gettin' angry!
Autumn Blaze: That's what I said! You know, after I started talking again.
Applejack: [gasps] I bet this here's the problem that Fluttershy and I came to help y'all with!
Autumn Blaze: Really? Who's Fluttershy? Oh! Did you name your shadow? Mine's called "Silhouette Gloom of the Sundown Lands".
Applejack: Right... Well, I'm thinkin' if we just go talk to the other Kirin, we can get 'em to welcome you back proper-like. Maybe even convince 'em to take your cure.
Autumn Blaze: Oh, yes! Yes, of course! Oh, just one small thing. The antidote from my anecdote? It's gone.
Applejack: There's no cure left?!
Autumn Blaze: I used the last of the foal's-breath flowers to make it. And I-I haven't seen them bloom since.
Applejack: [sighs] Well, this wouldn't be a friendship quest if it was easy. I'm gonna start by gettin' your friends to welcome you back!
Autumn Blaze: You know, between you and me, I'm not sure she's gonna convince them. [deep voice] Nope! [normal voice] But... [whispering] I hope she does.
Applejack: [panting] Fluttershy! Guess what!
Applejack and Fluttershy: I figured out the friendship problem! Me, too! Go ahead! [laugh]
Applejack: Bet that's a problem the Kirin never have.
Fluttershy: [giggles] No.
Applejack: Anyhow, we gotta get 'em all talkin' again.
Fluttershy: Oh, no-no-no-no-no! We can't ever let that happen!
Applejack: I thought you said you figured out the friendship problem. Was somethin' lost in translation?
Fluttershy: The Kirin are usually peaceful and kind. But when they get mad, they turn into Niriks, creatures made of fire and vengeance!
Applejack: Heh. That seemed less scary when it was in a song.
Fluttershy: The last time they all argued, they got so angry, they accidentally destroyed their whole village. So the Kirin decided to make sure it would never happen again.
Applejack: But that's no reason to stop talkin'.
Fluttershy: Yes, it is! Fire is dangerous, especially in a forest like this. Why, think of all the animals it could hurt.
Applejack: Not if they don't turn into fire-breathin' Nirik in the first place.
Fluttershy: And how can you be sure that won't happen?
Applejack: There's gotta be a better way than givin' up all your feelin's!
Fluttershy: Applejack! You're not listening!
Applejack: 'Cause you're not talkin' any sense!
Fluttershy: Um, what are they doing?
Applejack and Fluttershy: [yelp]
Fluttershy: [grunts] Maybe they got worried because we were arguing with each other.
Applejack: Aw, shucks! We were just havin' a normal, civil disagreement! Honest!
Fluttershy: W-Where are they taking us?! [grunting]
Applejack: To the Stream of Silence! If we hit that water, we'll never be able to talk or feel anythin' ever again!
Applejack and Fluttershy: [gasp]
Autumn Blaze: [distorted] Put them down!
[flames roaring]
Fluttershy: [whimpering]
Applejack: It's all right. I think I know this one. And she's tryin' to help.
Autumn Blaze: Well, yeah! Can't have them silence the only friend who'll speak to me.
Fluttershy: She talks?
Applejack: You have no idea. Fluttershy, meet Autumn Blaze.
Fluttershy: Well, thank you for that... um, wall of fire. But I thought Niriks were dangerous when they're angry. How did you know you could control your temper?
Autumn Blaze: I didn't. Huh. I guess anger's like other feelings. It's not about having them. It's what you do with them.
Applejack: And givin' up happiness to keep away anger is no kind o' life.
Fluttershy: I never thought of it that way. I can't imagine not being able to talk to my animal friends.
Autumn Blaze: Fern Flare, you used to love to laugh at everything. And Rain Shine, you sung the most beautiful harmonies. Don't you miss it?
Applejack: I know you're worried about fightin'. But friends can disagree without causin' a ruckus.
Fluttershy: Everypony gets mad sometimes. Even Applejack and I argue.
Applejack: What?! When do we ever argue?
Fluttershy: [clears throat] On the way here? And about the Kirin being silent? And right now!
Applejack and Fluttershy: [growl, laugh]
Applejack: We don't always see eye-to-eye. But we never let that get in the way of our friendship.
Fluttershy: And if you're really angry, then take some time away to be a Nirik where it won't hurt anypony.
Applejack: I-I think they're tryin' to say somethin'.
Autumn Blaze: Okay, are you hungry? Oh, no. Is some Kirin trapped in a well? Okay, "baby". "Baby fish". "Ba"— "Ba"— No. "Baby fish mouth"? Uh, something? Anything?! [groans] Just write it down! [groans] This is making me furious. Would you excuse me? I'll be right back. [distorted scream] You were saying?
[beat]
Autumn Blaze: Ohhhh! You want the cure for the Stream of Silence!
Fluttershy: That's wonderful! Uh, isn't it?
Applejack: Well, it would be. Except there aren't any flowers left to make the cure.
Fluttershy: Are you sure?
Autumn Blaze: Oh, beyond sure. Believe me, I've had a lot of alone time lately. I searched the entire forest seventy-three and a half times. Although I wonder if that second half could make a difference.
Fluttershy: Hmm. I wish she'd told us what kind of flowers she's looking for.
Applejack: They're called foal's-breath.
Fluttershy: I've never heard of that.
[squirrel chittering]
Applejack: Uh, Fluttershy? A little help?
[squirrel chittering]
Fluttershy: [gasps] He says he knows where to find more foal's-breath!
Applejack: Well, what are we waitin' for? Lead the way!
Fluttershy: [gasps] That's what foal's-breath looks like?!
Applejack: Autumn Blaze never would've made it past the Peaks to search here. I owe you an apology.
Fluttershy: Why?
Applejack: 'Cause if your kindness hadn't made you stop to help the squirrels, we never would've found this here flower.
Fluttershy: And if your honesty hadn't convinced the Kirin to talk, we wouldn't need to find it.
Applejack: [chuckles] Guess it's a good thing the map sent both of us, huh?
Autumn Blaze: [gasps] You found them?! Where were they?! Tell me everything, and feel free to add complicated descriptions and comedic tangents!
[beat]
Autumn Blaze: Oh. Right. First things first.
[shimmering]
[Kirin laughing, cheering, singing]
Rain Shine: Autumn Blaze, you have given us a gift. The realization that anger is within us, but it is our choice how we let it out. We would very much like it if you came back to live with us. I can't say how much we've missed your beautiful voice.
[Autumn Blaze]
'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky
Unless you let it rain
And candles just won't glow until they're burned
No, you can't give up your laughter
'Cause you're scared of a little pain
It's a lesson that my village never learned
Oh, yes, 'cause rainbows won't light up the sky
Unless you let it...
Raaaaaaaain!
[shimmering]
