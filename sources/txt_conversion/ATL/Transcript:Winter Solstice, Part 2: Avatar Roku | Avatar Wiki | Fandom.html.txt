The scene opens to a full moon in the sky. The camera pans down and shows Senlin Village during early morning hours. Cut to a view from among the houses, slowly zooming in on Aang who tries to get Appa to move, yanking on the reins, though the bison continually refuses and sits down.
Aang: [Strained voice.] Let's go, Appa! Come on, boy! [Appa roars in protest and sits down. Cut to a close side-view; Aang sadly addresses his pet.] Look I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't coming to the Fire Nation with us. [Frontal shot; looks down and away, sadly.] If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself. [Cut back to the side-shot; sternly, emphasizing his command by straightening himself.] So get your big butt off the ground and let's go!
He jerks at the reins, stretching them out, but is flung to the ground when the ropes pull him back as Appa did not move a muscle. Cut to a forlorn looking Aang, sitting spread-legged on the ground.
Sokka: [Voice-over; Aang gasps in surprise and looks over his right shoulder and over his left, turning around in search for the origins of the voice.] I think his big butt is trying to tell ya something.
Cut to a frontal shot of Appa as the camera swiftly pans to the right to reveal a collection of Senlin villagers, with Katara and Sokka standing in the front.
Katara: [Desperately.] Please don't go Aang. The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation. [Closer shot of Katara's pleading face.] Neither can I.
Aang: [Looks away sadly and recalls an image of Sozin's Comet.] But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means! [Side-shot as he approaches his friends.] I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the solstice. That's today!
Aang airbends himself atop Appa's head. Close shot of him looking back with a sad expression on his face as he prepares to leave. As Appa stands up, the shot changes to a frontal view, and Katara and Sokka run to stand before the bison, preventing him from moving any further.
Katara: We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang.
Sokka: [Aang stares curiously.] At least, not without your friends. We got your back. [Momo soars up and perches atop Aang's shoulder, and Appa licks Sokka, who angrily looks at the bison.] Ew!
Senlin Village leader: It's a long journey to the Crescent Island. [Hands Aang a small bundle.] You'll have to fly fast to have any chance of making it before sundown. Good luck.
Aang: Thank you for your-
Senlin Village leader: [Interrupts sharply, yelling. Points toward the ocean.] Go!
Appa takes off with Aang, Momo, Katara, and Sokka. Later that morning, the Senlin Village leader exits a building, but he stops in his track upon finding Zuko standing in his path. In the background, Iroh is sitting on a komodo rhino.
Zuko: [The Senlin Village leader gasps.] Having trouble sleeping? [Pushes the man back through the door, knocking him down. Frontal shot as he approaches him.] Seen the Avatar lately?
Day has come. Appa soars over the ocean. Aang, Katara, and Sokka all watch the ocean fearfully.
Aang: Come on boy, we've got a long way to go. Faster!
Iroh: [Close-up.] Sailing into Fire Nation waters ... Of all the foolish things you've done in your sixteen years, Prince Zuko, this is the most foolish!
Zuko: I have no choice, Uncle.
Iroh: [Angrily.] Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord banished you? [Fearfully.] What if you're caught?
Zuko: [Breaks away from telescope to talk to his uncle.] I'm chasing the Avatar! My father will understand why I am returning home!
Iroh: You give him too much credit. My brother is not the understanding type!
Zuko: [Looks back into his telescope. Dark scope view reveals Appa mid-flight.] There they are. Helmsman! Full steam ahead!
Katara: [Looking back to Zuko's ship.] Aang. We've got trouble!
Sokka: [Panicked.] Yeah! And it's gaining, fast!
A Fire Nation catapult is raised to the deck of Zuko's ship. It is loaded with a steaming projectile.
Iroh: [Waving a fan at his face.] Uh, really Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant?
Zuko: [Lights the stinking ball with a fire punch.] On my mark! Fire!
A guard beside him slices the rope holding back the catapult. The flaming projectile races toward Appa.
Katara: [Yelling.] Fireball!
Aang: I'm on it!
Katara: [Aang, Katara, and Sokka all make faces and grasp their noses.] We have to get out of Zuko's range, before he shoots another hot stinker at us!
Sokka: Can't you make Appa go any faster?
Aang: Yeah. But there's just one little problem.
Zuko: [Close-up. Eyes widening.] A blockade.
Birds-eye view of a two-row line of Fire Nation ships stretching across the ocean as far as the eye can see. Brief glimpse of numerous Fire Nation catapults prepared to fire.
Iroh: Technically you are still in Earth Kingdom waters. Turn back now and they cannot arrest you.
Aang: If we fly north, we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade! It's the only way.
Katara: There's no time!
Aang: This is exactly why I didn't want you to come! It's too dangerous!
Katara: And that's exactly why we're here.
Sokka: [Boldly.] Let's run this blockade! [Both Katara and Sokka grin confidently.]
Aang: Appa, yip-yip! [Appa roars readily, sailing forward even quicker.]
Zuko: He's not turning around!
Iroh: Please Prince Zuko! If the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do! Do not follow the Avatar.
Zuko: [Lowers his head, closes his eyes, and clenches his hands into fists. Sorrowfully.] I'm sorry, Uncle. [Raises his head, opens his eyes, and thrusts his right hand forward commandingly.] Run the blockade!
Zhao: [Gazing through telescope.] The Avatar. [Lowers telescope lens to spot Zuko's ship.] And the banished prince. [Lowers telescope.] This must be my lucky day.
Captain: Commander Zhao. What are your orders?
Zhao: Shoot the bison down, captain.
Captain: [Surprised.] But there's a Fire Navy ship out there, sir! One of our own! What if it's hit?
Zhao: So be it. [Captain backs up in shock. Zhao continues coolly.] It belongs to a traitor. [Command.] Ignite. Launch!
The sky becomes littered with flaming fireballs fired from the blockade. View from Zuko's ship as the fireballs fill the sky. Close-up of a screaming Aang, Sokka, and Katara. Zoom out as Appa evades numerous fireballs, some exploding mid-air. Camera switch to forward view, close-up, as they fly through a blanket of fireballs. The team flies directly through one that exploded before them, Appa's fur darkened from the explosion. Katara, Sokka, and Momo all slap out embers on Appa's fur.
Aang: Appa, are you okay? [Appa roars a reply. They soar higher into the clouds.]
On the ocean surface, Zuko's ship is narrowly missing many falling fireballs. Sheets of ocean water crash over the ship, and crew members run for safety. A single fireball explodes on the aft side of the vessel.
Engineer: Prince Zuko! The engines are damaged! We need to stop and make repairs!
Zuko: [Spins away from the man, facing the blockade.] Do not stop this ship.
Zhao: Launch!
Close-up of Aang's view. Just over a cloud; fireballs burst through everywhere and smoke fills the screen. Aang, Katara, and Sokka scream and duck away, while Katara and Sokka grip Appa's saddle. Appa dodges many fireballs before two collide and explode in front of him. Sokka is thrown from the saddle and begins to plunge for the ocean, screaming anew.
Aang: [Cries out desperately.] Sokka! [Whips the reins down and begins a speedy descent in chase of Sokka.]
Appa reaches Sokka just in time. Katara grabs his hand, pulling him back into saddle. Appa skims the ocean surface. A fish appears out of nowhere and slaps Sokka square in the face, knocking him into the saddle. Momo leaps up and grabs the fish as Appa continues his swift flight mere feet above the ocean. Fireballs crash into the water all around them.
Zhao: Ready ... [Holds hand up, issuing his command.]
Close-up of Appa's view, approaching the ships. Camera switch once to Zhao, moving to prepare the signal. Back to Aang, a look of obstinate determination overcomes him.
Zhao: Fire!
A single catapult launches a fire blast directly toward Appa. Close-up of Aang's eye as it snaps open, unafraid. Aang airbends forward off of Appa's head. He uses a powerful airbending kick, and the flaming boulder explodes in a large smoky blast. Aang falls back to Appa's head, Katara and Sokka grabbing him. Appa soars safely over the blockade, passing them.
Aang: [Ecstatic.] We made it!
Sokka: [Katara and Sokka each grimacing in terror.] We got into the Fire Nation. [Meekly.] Great.
Captain: Where do you think the Avatar is headed, sir?
Zhao: I'm not sure. [Turns aside, gazes at Zuko's smoking ship.] But I bet a certain banished prince will know.
Scene switch to just overhead Zuko's ship. His small vessel approaches two ships in the blockade. These two ships sail opposite directions, in a moment they will close off Zuko's ship's path.
Iroh: We're on a collision course!
Zuko: [Confidently.] We can make it!
Captain: [Captain stands ahead of a squad of nine firebenders.] The boarding party is ready to apprehend Prince Zuko, sir.
Zhao: [Swiftly.] Wait! Cut the engines, and let them pass.
Captain: Sir?
Each ship in the blockade halts, allowing Zuko's ship to glide by beneath their deck, untouched. Zhao stands high, sharing an interlocked gaze with the banished prince below. Zuko and Iroh look behind them in silence as they sail safely through. Iroh strokes his gray beard curiously.
The scene cuts back to Appa, flying among blue skies. Sokka and Katara sit up in the saddle, while Aang sits on Appa's head.
The scene changes to Sokka slumped in the back of the saddle. Katara is leaning her arms over the front of the saddle, and Aang is lounging against Appa's neck.
The sky has changed to a darker, sunset-filled evening. Appa is visibly tired. Aang is sprawled over Appa's head with Momo equally sprawled over Aang's head. Katara and Sokka have each collapsed into the saddle.
Aang: [Close-up. Momo is shown bouncing about in eager surprise.] There it is! [Sokka and Katara pop up in the saddle.] The island where Roku's dragon took me. [Full view of Crescent Island and its smoking volcano as Appa descends.]
Appa is lying at the base of a stone bridge leading up to the island's mountain. The bridge ends at an elegant, multi-story Fire Temple. Lava is flowing beneath the bridge. The air is thick with steam. Aang stands by Appa's head, and Katara stands to Appa's side. Sokka is stretching further away.
Aang: [Rubs against Appa's head.] You did it buddy. Nice flying. [Appa bellows in satisfaction, rolling to his side to wave his three legs into the air lazily. Appa's tongue lolls out.]
Katara: [Smiles sweetly and approaches Appa. Rubs his belly.] Aww, you must be tired.
Sokka: [Joyous. Katara's expresses dumbfounded interest.] No! I'm good. Refreshed and ready to fight some firebenders! [Continues to work out and flex his body.]
Katara: [Props hand off hip. Responds dryly.] I was talking to Appa.
Sokka: [Instantly halts exercise.] Well ... I was talking to Momo. [Points to the lemur clinging to a dead tree's branch.]
Scene cut to Katara, Sokka, Aang, and Momo walking along the stone bridge to approach a multi-story Fire Temple.
Sokka: [Close-up, top-to-bottom view of the Fire Temple.] I don't see any guards.
Katara: [Camera drops to show the group taking cover behind a lower wall below steps.] The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died.
Aang: It's almost sundown. We better hurry! [The group leaps over the wall and charges for the front door.]
Sokka: [The group tip-toes through an enormous chamber with fire-decor columns.] Wait. I think I heard something.
Great Fire Sage: [Turning around, they see five men standing in the hallway dressed in red with tall hats.] We are the Fire Sages. Guardians of the temple of the Avatar.
Aang: Great! I am the Avatar!
Great Fire Sage: We know. [Inhales briskly before punching a blast of fire their direction.]
Aang: [Deflects three balls of fire with his airbending. Close-up. Shouts over his shoulder.] I'll hold them off. Run!
Aang leaps forward and spins his leg across the ground, sending a low air blade that sweeps the Fire Sages' legs out from beneath them, and they all fall to the ground. Aang flees after his friends.
Great Fire Sage: If the Avatar contacts Roku, there's no telling how powerful the boy will become! Split up and find him.
Aang: [Hallway view; Aang skids in front of Katara and Sokka and continues running.] Follow me!
Sokka: Do you know where you're going? [The two follow Aang.]
Aang: [Rounds a corner and disappears from sight.] Nope! [A moment passes, Katara and Sokka stop when Aang skids into view again. Fearfully.] Wrong way! [Runs past them.]
Shyu: [Rounds the corner, frightening Sokka and Katara to chase after Aang.] Come back!
The trio turns another corner and charges down the hallway. However, they reach a dead-end as Aang skids to an immediate halt. Turning around, they face Shyu, who raises a hand in peace.
Shyu: I don't want to fight you! I am a friend.
Sokka: Firebenders aren't our friends! [Aang steps ahead of his friends, assuming an airbending posture.]
Shyu: [Steps toward the Avatar, before dropping to his knees and pressing his palms to the floor in submission. This startles Aang, Katara, and Sokka.] I know why you're here, Avatar.
Aang: [Surprised.] You do?
Shyu: Yes. [Rises from the floor to stand again.] You wish to speak to Avatar Roku. I can take you to him.
Aang: [Skeptically.] How?
Shyu: [Slides back a lamplight on the wall. Places palm on wall, focuses firebending into this location to open a secret passage.] This way.
Great Fire Sage: [Echoes in the distance.] Find him.
Shyu: [Briefly glances down the hall.] Time is running out! Quickly!
Aang and Katara exchange a look with one another, asserting each other's belief to trust this firebender. The group enters the passage and descends the steps into the cave. Shyu enters behind them and closes the passageway.
Zuko: [Close-up. Tightens knuckles on ship's railing. Smoke billows behind his ship.] What's he up to, Uncle? Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?
Iroh: Because he wants to follow you. He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after: the Avatar.
Zuko: [Close-up.] If Zhao wants to follow a trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do.
Shyu: [Brief scene cut to show the sun nearly setting. Far overhead view of Shyu leading the group through caverns.] Avatar Roku once called this temple his home. He formed these secret passages out of the magma.
Aang: Did you know Avatar Roku?
Shyu: No. But my grandfather knew him. Many generations of Fire Sages guarded this Fire Temple long before me. We all have a strong spiritual connection to this place.
Aang: Is that how you knew I was coming?
Shyu: A few weeks ago, an amazing thing occurred. The statue of Avatar Roku; its eyes began to glow!
Katara: That's when we were at the Air Temple. Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there, too!
Shyu: At that moment, we knew you had returned to the world.
Aang: If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the sages attack me?
Shyu: Things have changed. In the past, the sages were loyal only to the Avatar. When Roku died, the sages eagerly awaited for the next Avatar to return. But he never came.
Aang: [Looking down, guiltily.] They were waiting for me.
Sokka: [Humorously mocking.] Hey don't feel bad. You're only a hundred years late! [Aang scowls heavily at Sokka.]
Shyu: They lost hope the Avatar would ever return. When Fire Lord Sozin began the War, my grandfather and the other sages were forced to follow him. [Shakes head sadly.] I never wanted to serve the Fire Lord. When I learned you were coming, I knew I would have to betray the other sages.
Aang: Thank you for helping me. [Close-up as Shyu smiles to Aang.]
Shyu: [Continues leading the group up a spiraling flight of stairs.] We'll follow these stairs to the sanctuary. [Time skip, Shyu continues talking as they near the top of the stairs.] Once you're inside, wait for the light to hit Avatar Roku's statue. Only then will you be able to speak with him.
Slides back a secret tile and climbs into the outer sanctuary. Massive columns with dragon statues atop them line the room. An immense door is before them with a device holding five open-mouthed dragons.
Shyu: [Gasps.] No!
Aang: [Approaches door.] Shyu, what's wrong?
Shyu: The sanctuary doors, they're closed!
Katara: [Aang tugs at the door uselessly.] Can't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door?
Shyu: No. Only a fully realized Avatar is powerful enough to open this door alone. Otherwise, the sages must open this door together, [Sokka shown in deep thought.] with five simultaneous fire blasts.
Sokka: [Ponderously states.] Five fire blasts, huh? [Zoom out to show a lamplight above him.] I think I can help you out.
The scene switches to Zuko's smoke-billowing ship. Close-up to show a small vessel holding Zuko being slid into the waters.
Zuko: Uncle, keep heading north. Zhao will follow the smoke trail, while I use it as a cover.
Iroh grunts in doubt, stroking his beard in deep thought. Zuko's boat settles on the ocean's surface and disappears in the smoke. Switch to a telescope view of nothing but smoke. Zhao lowers telescope, staring with determination.
Switch to view of sanctuary door.
Sokka: [Kneeling. Pours oil into a bag.] This is a little trick I picked up from my father. I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing, Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and, [Picks up bag, holds it proudly before him.] ta-da! Fake firebending!
Katara: [Impressed.] You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka.
Shyu: This might actually work.
Shyu: [Time skip. Sokka places his last bag into the dragon's mouth.] The sages will hear the explosion, so as soon as they go off, you rush in!
Katara: [Hides behind a column with her brother. Holds Momo. Glances to the next column where Aang hides.] It's almost sunset. Are you ready?
Aang: Definitely.
Shyu thrusts his finger forward, sending a small flare racing across the door to light all five bags at once. Shyu hurries to take cover. There is an intense explosion, producing a lot of smoke. Aang bursts forward and runs for the door. Aang strains to open the door, which has not budged.
Aang: [Surprised.] They're still locked!
Shyu: [Sadly sighs. Sokka rises from hiding behind his sister.] It didn't work. [Aang falls to his knees.]
Aang: [Time skip. Everyone stands in front of the door. Aang beats upon it furiously with consecutive airbending slices.] Why, won't, it, open?!
Katara: [Presses forward. Seizes Aang's arm.] Aang! Stop! [Relaxes, releasing his arm.] There's nothing else we can do ...
Aang: [Glumly.] I'm sorry I put you through all of this for nothing.
Sokka: [Examining the explosion. Runs his finger across the black soot.] I don't get it. That firebending looked as strong as any firebending I've seen.
Katara: [A moment passes. Sudden excitement.] Sokka, you're a genius!
Aang: [Confused.] Wait. How is Sokka a genius? His plan didn't even work.
Sokka: [Pleasantly.] Come on Aang. Let her dream.
Katara: You're right. Sokka's plan didn't work. But it looks like it did.
Aang: [Dubiously.] Did the definition of genius change over the last hundred years? [Katara grasps her chin, slyly grinning toward Aang.]
Shyu: [Time skip. Fire Sages run toward Shyu in front of the door.] Come quickly! The Avatar has entered the sanctuary!
Great Fire Sage: How did he get in?
Shyu: I don't know. But look at the scorch marks! And down there! [Points to a shadow visible at the bottom of the door.]
Great Fire Sage: He's inside! Open the doors, immediately! Before he contacts Avatar Roku!
Aang slides into position behind a nearby column as the five sages firebend the doors locks open. As the door opens, a sooty Momo is revealed sitting on the floor. Momo sneezes, blowing the soot off himself.
Great Fire Sage: It's the Avatar's lemur. He must have crawled through the pipes! We've been tricked!
Momo springs into action, leaping atop the Great Fire Sage's head and clinging to his hat. Katara charged forward, pulling a nearby sage's tunic over his head to blind him. Sokka grabs the lower skirt of a sage's outfit, lifting it completely over his body to cover his face.
Shyu: [Grabs the last free sage and hauls him into his grip, pinning him.] Now, Aang!
Katara: [A moment of silence.] Aang! Now's your chance!
Zuko: [Steps out from behind column. Grips Aang from behind, pinning Aang's arms behind him.] The Avatar's coming with me! [The captured sages use their captors' surprise to reclaim the upper hand, pinning their captors down. Momo flies off with the Great Fire Sage's hat.] Close the doors! Quickly!
Walking down steps, Aang glances over his shoulders to see Sokka and Katara being chained to a column. He breaks free, spinning behind Zuko to send him down the stairs with an airbending blast. Aang runs for Katara and Sokka.
Katara: [Chained. Sees him coming toward her. Turns head toward the closing door.] Go!
Aang listens without hesitation, turning to charge for the door guarded by two sages. He leaps into the air to avoid the Great Fire Sage's fire punch. Aang bounces off his hands from each of the two sage's heads before sailing through the door just as it closes.
Katara: [Pleased.] He made it!
Everyone looks away as the door seals with a blinding flash of white light. Inside, Aang is kneeling and looks up to a tall statue of Avatar Roku. A beam of red sunlight enters the room and strikes a glistening red jewel held by the statue.
Aang: [Stands. Confused.] The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku. So why isn't anything happening?
Zuko: [He and four sages launch fire blasts into the door's locks. Nothing happens. Frustrated.] Why isn't it working? It's sealed shut!
Great Fire Sage: It must have been the light. Avatar Roku doesn't want us inside.
Aang: [Exasperated. Standing in the middle of the room, facing the statue.] Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing! All I know is airbending! Please Avatar Roku, talk to me!
Roku's statue turns red as sunlight engulfs it. Its eyes glow white. View of Aang as smoke fills the room. When the white smoke dissipates Avatar Roku is standing before him, they are on a mountaintop and only clouds are visible below.
Roku: It's good to see you Aang. What took you so long? [Aang respectfully places a fist into his palm, bowing his head to the Avatar before him.]
Zuko: [Firmly to Shyu, who is kneeling before him with his hands behind his back.] Why did you help the Avatar?
Shyu: [Sadly and proudly.] Because it was once the sages' duty. It is still our duty.
Zhao: [Claps. Interrupts interrogation. Approaches with six firebender guards.] What a moving and heartfelt performance. I'm certain the Fire Lord will understand, when you explain why you betrayed him.
Great Fire Sage: [Places palms together. Bows head forward.] Commander Zhao.
Zhao: And Prince Zuko. It was a noble effort, but your little smokescreen didn't work. [Zuko scowls sharply. Firebenders step behind him, seizing his arms.] Two traitors in one day, the Fire Lord will be pleased.
Zuko: [Strains against his captor, snaps at Zhao.] You're too late, Zhao! The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed.
Zhao: No matter. [Grins confidently.] Sooner or later, he has to come out. [Katara and Sokka share a worried glance.]
Roku: I have something very important to tell you, Aang. That is why, when you were in the Spirit World, I sent my dragon to find you.
Aang: [Interested, curious.] Is it about that vision? The one of the comet?
Roku: Yes.
Aang: What does it mean?
Roku: One hundred years ago, [Viewers see a visual of a comet in the dark sky.] Fire Lord Sozin used that comet to begin the War. He and his firebending army harnessed its incredible power, and dealt a deadly first strike against the other nations.
Aang: [Close-up.] So the comet made them stronger?
Roku: [Close-up.] Yes. Stronger than you could even imagine.
Aang: [Close-up.] But that happened a hundred years ago. What does the comet have to do with the War now?
Roku: Listen carefully. [Viewers see silhouette of Fire Lord Ozai standing amid flames, fists taut.] Sozin's Comet will return by the end of the summer, and Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to finish the War, once and for all. [Visual and audio of Ozai's silhouette roaring upward, fire streaming from his mouth.] If he succeeds, even the Avatar won't be able to restore balance to the world. Aang. You must defeat the Fire Lord, before the comet arrives.
Aang: [Counters anxiously.] But I haven't even started learning waterbending! Not to mention earth and fire!
Roku: Mastering the elements takes years of discipline and practice. But if the world is to survive, you must do it by summer's end. [Close-up of a shocked Aang.]
Firebenders, including Zhao and his crew, circle around the door's perimeter, assuming a firebending form. A monk chant begins for the audience only. They wait patiently for the door to open.
Zhao: When those doors open, [Shouts.] unleash all your firepower!
Katara: [Worried.] How's Aang gonna make it out of this?
Sokka: [Troubled, questioning.] How are we gonna make it out of this?
Aang: [Terrified.] What if I can't master all the elements in time? What if I fail?
Roku: I know you can do it Aang. [Close-up of half his face.] For you have done it before. [Close-up of half of Aang's now-smiling face.] The solstice is ending. We must go our separate ways, for now.
Aang: But I won't be able to come back to the temple. What if I have questions? How will I talk to you?
Roku: I am a part of you. When you need to talk to me again, you will find a way. [Closes his eyes, providing Aang a vision of Fire Navy ships surrounding the island. Speaks to his mind without words.] A great danger awaits you at the temple. [Provides a vision of the awaiting firebenders on the other side of the door.] I can help you face the threat. But only if you are ready.
Aang: [Eyes and arrows glow.] I'm ready.
Scene switches to the guard surrounding the door. The door glows bright white once again. Smoke streams come through into the room. The door unlocks itself, beginning to open. As it opens, a blinding white light forces all present to look away.
Zhao: Ready ... [Light fades, revealing a pair of glowing white eyes in the darkness.]
Katara: [Sokka struggles against his chains. Katara is terrified.] No! Aang!
Zhao: Fire! [He and his guards cooperate in blasting fire onto the unseen target.]
The wall of fire amasses, circling its new host as Avatar Roku, eyes aglow, is revealed behind the flames, untouched. Close-up of a shocked and horror-stricken Zhao.
Shyu: [In awe.] Avatar Roku ...
Avatar Roku draws the circling fire together in one motion. He sends it forward in one powerful wave that sears the room, blasting the offenders off their feet and melting the chains binding Katara, Sokka, Shyu, and Zuko with precision. View of outside the temple as the blast destroys the outer wall. Close-up of ghostly Avatar Roku, turning his glowing glare upon the offending sages. The sages panic, all turning to run from his wrath.
Shyu: [Implores.] Avatar Roku is going to destroy the temple! We have to get out of here!
Katara: Not without Aang!
Roku kneels into a forward strike, melting the floor with a molten firebending trail. He steadily lifts his hand, causing the stream of lava below to erupt into maddened explosions. The lava soars through the temple, tearing it apart. Zhao and his firebenders are shown fleeing for the temple's exit.
Katara and Sokka huddle together, arm-in-arm, behind a column. Sokka kneels over his sister, protecting her in a brotherly fashion. The destruction ceases momentarily as Roku lowers his hands, exhaling soundly. The solstice' beam of sunlight is shown leaving his statue; its eyes no longer glow. As this happens all smoke in the room draws in upon Avatar Roku, his form disappearing to leave behind a weary Aang.
Sokka: [Aang sighs weakly and drops to his knees. Sokka and Katara approach Aang's sides, supportively lifting him back to his feet.] We got your back.
Aang: [Weakly.] Thanks. Where's Shyu?
Katara: [ Walking away with Sokka, helping Aang.] I don't know.
Visual of the temple as it begins to lean, due to the destruction caused. Aang, Katara and Sokka stare in horror upon seeing the stairwell leading to the exit filled with lava. They quickly turn to the only exit; the hole in the wall Roku had created. There is no escaping, as they are on the top level of the temple.
All three gasp in surprise as they notice Appa and Momo swiftly closing in. They run out of the temple, leaping into Appa's saddle. Scene of them flying away on Appa, gazing back at the destruction. Momo pops up wearing the Great Fire Sage's hat. Scene of Zhao watching the bison fly away.
Zhao: [Turns angrily, snapping.] No Prince, no Avatar! Apparently, the only thing I do have is five traitors!
Great Fire Sage: [Interjects.] But Commander! Only Shyu helped the Avatar.
Zhao: [Close-up.] Save your stories for the Fire Lord. As far as I'm concerned, you are all guilty! [Orders.] Take them to the prison hold!
The scene changes to show Zuko spying with his telescope toward Appa flying away. He lowers the telescope and sails off in his vessel.
Night time falls. Appa flies through the clouds. Scene from behind, a mourning Aang with his head hung. Katara and Sokka stand and approach their friend, kneeling behind him to support him. Katara puts her hand around Aang's shoulders.
