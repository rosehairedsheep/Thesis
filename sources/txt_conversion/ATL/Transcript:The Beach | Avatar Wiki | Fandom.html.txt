Aang: I'm okay. [Momo jumps on his shoulder.]
Toph: Well, that was random.
Katara: [Sitting up and looking back.] I don't think so. I get the feeling he knows who we are.
Cut to a close-up of a campfire. The picture of the Royal Family is thrown into the fire. Cut to a close-up of Zuko in the picture as it begins to burn.
Ty Lee: What are you doing?
Zuko: [Frontal view.] What does it look like I'm doing?
Ty Lee: [Close-up aerial view of Zuko standing next to the fire.] But, it's a painting of your family.
Zuko: [The camera pans up to Zuko's face; angrily.] You think I care?
Ty Lee: [Off-camera.] I think you do.
Zuko: You don't know me, so why don't you just mind your own business? [Walks away.]
Ty Lee: [Close-up. Scoffs.] I know you.
Zuko: [Frontal view.] No, you don't. [Close-up.] You're stuck in your little "Ty Lee world" where everything's great all the time.
Mai: Zuko, [Frontal view.] leave her alone.
Zuko: [Walks away. Frontal view of campsite. Imitating Ty Lee.] "I'm so pretty. Look at me. I can walk on my hands. Whoo!" [Does a handstand. Frontal view of Ty Lee, upset. Close-up of Zuko, as he falls to the ground. Frontal view of Ty Lee, Zuko's face in the foreground.] Circus freak.
Ty Lee: [Side-view. Azula giggles. Ty Lee cries.] Yes, I'm a circus freak. Go ahead and laugh all you want. You want to know why I joined the circus?
Azula: Here we go.
Ty Lee: [Aerial view of camp site.] Do you have any idea what my home life was like? [Frontal view.] Growing up with six sisters who look exactly like me? [She stands.] It was like I didn't even have my own name. [Side-view. Kneels down, crying.] I joined the circus [Close-up side-view.] because I was scared of spending the rest of my life as part of a matched set. At least I'm different now. [Frontal view, she lifts her head; angrily.] "Circus freak" is a compliment.
Mai: [Frontal view.] Guess that explains why you need ten boyfriends, too.
Ty Lee: [Frontal view over Mai's shoulder; balls her hands into fists and points them on her hips.] I'm sorry, what?
Mai: [Frontal view.] Attention issues. You couldn't get enough attention when you were a kid, so you're trying to make up for it now.
Ty Lee: [Close-up.] Well, what's your excuse, Mai? You were an only child for fifteen years, but even with all that attention, your aura is this dingy, pasty, gray ...
Mai: [Frontal view.] I don't believe in auras.
Zuko: [Camera pans right. Getting up.] Yeah, you do not believe in anything.
Mai: [Close-up; sarcastically.] Oh, well, I'm sorry I can't be as high-strung and crazy as the rest of you.
Zuko: [Aerial view of campsite. Walking up to the campfire.] I'm sorry, too. I wish you would be high-strung and crazy for once instead of keeping all your feeling bottled up inside. [Frontal view.] She just called your aura dingy. Are you gonna take that?
Mai: [Aerial view of campsite. Leaning back.] What do you want from me? You want a teary confession about how hard my childhood was? Well, it wasn't. [Close-up.] I was a rich only child who got anything I wanted ... as long as I behaved [Cut to shot of the sky.] and sat still, and didn't speak unless spoken to. [Close-up of Zuko.] My mother said I had to keep out of trouble. We had my dad's political career to think about.
Azula: [Side-view of campsite.] Well, that's it, then. [Close-up.] You have a controlling mother who had certain expectations, and if you strayed from them, you were shut down. That's why you're afraid to care about anything, and why you can't express yourself.
Mai: [Frontal view.] You want me to express myself? [Stands up and yells.] Leave me alone!
Zuko: [Side-view of campsite. Frontal view of Zuko.] I like it when you express yourself. [Approaching, attempting to put a hand on her shoulder.]
Mai: [Frontal view.] Don't touch me! I'm still mad at you. [She sits.]
Zuko: [Side-view of Mai.] My life hasn't been that easy either, Mai.
Mai: Whatever. That doesn't excuse the way you've been acting.
Ty Lee: Calm down, you guys. [Frontal view of her and Azula.] This much negative energy is bad for your skin. You'll totally break out.
Zuko: Bad skin? [Frontal view.] Normal teenagers worry about bad skin. I don't have that luxury. [Leaning forward.] My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson on my face! [Points to his scar.]
Ty Lee: [Frontal view of Azula and Ty Lee from behind Zuko. Apologetically.] Sorry, Zuko, I ...
Zuko: [Turning around.] For so long I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy. I'm back home now, my dad talks to me. Ha! He even thinks I'm a hero. [Close-up of Azula, who smiles.] Everything should be perfect, right? [Aerial view of campsite.] I should be happy now, but I'm not. [Turning back to the others.] I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why!
Azula: [Frontal view.] There's a simple question you need to answer, then. Who are you angry at?
Zuko: [Close-up.] No one. I'm just angry.
Mai: [Side-view of the three girls.] Yeah, who are you angry at, Zuko?
Zuko: [Close-up.] Everyone. I don't know. [Becoming frustrated.]
Azula: [Frontal view.] Is it Dad?
Zuko: [Close-up.] No, no.
Ty Lee: [Frontal view.] Your uncle?
Azula: Me?
Zuko: [Close-up.] No, no, n-no, no!
Mai: [Close-up.] Then who? Who are you angry at?
Azula: [Camera pans left, past Ty Lee, to Azula.] Answer the question, Zuko.
Ty Lee: [Close-up.] Talk to us.
Mai: [Extreme close-up.] Come on, answer the question.
Azula: Come on, answer it.
Zuko: [Frontal view from behind the girls. Losing it now; furiously.] I'm angry at myself!
Slamming down with his clenched fists he causes the camp fire to turn into a pillar of fire, the girls recoil from the flames. Cut to close-up view from above of Zuko. Cut to a wide-view of the entire campsite as the flame dies down. Zuko turns away.
Azula: Why?
Zuko: [Close-up.] Because I'm confused. Because I'm not sure I know the difference between right and wrong anymore.
Azula: You're pathetic.
Mai: [View from behind Zuko.] I know one thing I care about. [Walks up to Zuko. Frontal view.] I care about you. [They kiss.]
Azula: [Claps. Camera zooms out to show her as Mai and Zuko turn.] Well, those were wonderful performances, everyone.
Zuko: [Frontal view.] I guess you wouldn't understand, would you, Azula? [He puts an arm around Mai.] Because you're just so perfect.
Azula: [Frontal view.] Well, yes, I guess you're right. I don't have sob stories like all of you. I could sit here and complain how our mom liked Zuko more than me, but I don't really care. [Gazes into the fire. Close-up view of the fire pit.] My own mother [Close-up.] thought I was a monster. [Close-up of Zuko and Mai. Close-up of Ty Lee. Side-view of campsite. After a momentary pause.] She was right, of course, but it still hurt.
Ty Lee: What Lo and Li said came true. The beach did help us learn about ourselves. [She picks up a rock and rubs it, smiling. Close-up.] I feel all smoothed. I'll always remember this.
Azula: [Side-view of campsite. Standing up.] You know what would make this trip really memorable?
Cut to a close-up of Azula. Cut to Chan's front door opening to reveal Chan.
Azula: [Frontal view.] We've got some bad news, Chan.
