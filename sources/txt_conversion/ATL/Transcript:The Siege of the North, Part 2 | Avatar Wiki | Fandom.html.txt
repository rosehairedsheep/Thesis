The episode opens to the Northern Water Tribe as the siege continues. Four fireballs streak past the screen. Cuts to overhead shot of the city as the fireballs strike various locations. The camera pans downward past the Tribal Chief's palace to the Spirit Oasis where Appa can be seen presiding by the pond. Cuts to shot of the two koi fish, the Moon and Ocean Spirits, swimming in their usual circular pattern. 
Katara: [Off-screen; sorrowfully.] I can't believe I lost him.
Cut to full shot of the pond, Sokka and Yue standing beside Katara, who is kneeling on the ground.
Sokka: You did everything you could, and now we need to do everything we can to get him back. [Cuts to shot of Katara who looks up at her brother, tears in her eyes.] Zuko can't have gotten far. We'll find him. Aang's gonna be fine.
Katara: Okay. [Closes eyes and gets up. Camera pans over to where Momo remains motionless on the ground. Cuts to shot of Appa, Katara having mounted the bison.] It's all right. You stay here, Momo, in case Aang comes back.
Sokka: Yip, yip.
The camera pans upward as Appa takes off, heading upward to a location above the oasis, a vast frozen tundra where a blizzard is raging. Cuts to shot of the icy terrain of the tundra as the bison progresses. Cuts to shot of the ground, a path visible in the snow where someone has clearly been trudging along; the camera pans upward. Cuts to shot of Zuko plodding through the snow, his face partially covered to protect him from the cold, Aang slung across his back. Cuts to shot of an unconscious Aang, his tattooed arrows glowing.
The scene changes suddenly, zooming out on Aang who is sitting in a meditating position on a small wooden platform in an unknown location in the Spirit World. Cuts to shot of his surroundings which are not that of the icy tundra, but a mystical swamp dotted with trees. A large white bird of some sort flies past. Cuts to shot of Aang as the bird flies over the screen; he stands and begins wandering about. Cuts to shot of a figure in the distance sitting beneath a simple wooden entranceway. The figure can be heard uttering the sound "Ohm". Aang appears on-screen, turns his head in the direction of the sound and begins making his way toward the figure. Cuts to side-view of the figure, a monkey-like creature, as Aang approaches him, before cutting to a shot of the two with the figure's back to the camera.
Aang: Hello? I'm sorry to disturb you. I just really need to find the Moon and the Ocean Spirits.
Baboon spirit: [Cut to a frontal shot of the baboon spirit.] Go. Away. [Opens one eye. Cut back to the side-shot.] You're still here?
Aang: Yes, I need -
Baboon spirit: [Cut to close-up of the baboon spirit who shuts his eyes tightly. Louder, trying to distract himself.] Ohm! [A firefly flies past; points at the insect.] Perhaps that thing will help you. Chase it. [Aang runs after it. The mystical monkey keeps his eyes shut for a second more before opening one to confirm Aang's departure. He shakes his head and breathes a sigh of relief.] Finally.
Cuts to a shot of Aang chasing the insect throughout the swamp and up a tree. He leaps up and manages to grasp hold of it and is delighted in doing so. Cuts to zoomed out shot of him as he lands on a tree branch which instantly shrivels up and disappears entirely, causing him to fall. Cuts briefly to close-up shot of an alarmed Aang before switching to a shot of him falling into the water. Aang is shown lying on his back in the water, the firefly having escaped his grip. It flies away as he tries to reach it again.
Aang: Come back!
He stands up. Cuts to shot of him looking down at the water, when Roku suddenly appears before Aang in a reflection in the water.
Roku: Hello, Aang.
Aang: [Looking at him; surprised.] Roku!
The scene cuts back to the real world, where Zuko continues his trek through the icy tundra. Cuts to close-up of him before a shot of the ground where he steps on ice that begins cracking beneath his feet; his eyes widen in surprise at this. Cuts to overhead shot of him, the camera zooming out, as the ice begins to splinter and cave in. Cuts to shot of him on high alert as he begins running, before switching to an overhead shot of him as he races through the snow. Cuts to shot of him as the impact of the ice caving in throws him off-balance.
Zuko is thrown several feet away and lands roughly in the snow, losing his grip on Aang and kicking up a cloud of snow. The cloud dissipates, showing Zuko and Aang lying in the snow. Cuts to shot of Zuko, as he raises his head and looks at the scene. Cuts to shot of the aftermath of the cave-in, the ground severely disrupted, and a shot of Zuko once more. He spots a cave off in the distance.
Zuko: Shelter. [Drags Aang into the cave and ties him up.]
Back in the Spirit World, Aang is speaking with Roku.
Aang: Roku, the Water Tribe's under attack. I need to find the Ocean and the Moon Spirits.
Roku: [Pops out of the reflection in front of Aang.] The Ocean and the Moon are ancient spirits. They crossed over the Spirit World to the mortal world very near the beginning. There is only one spirit I know of who is old enough to remember.
Aang: Who?
Roku: The spirit's name is Koh, but he is very dangerous. They call him the Face Stealer. [Aang looks horrified.] When you speak with him, you must be very careful to show no emotion at all. Not the slightest expression, or he will steal your face. [Aang looks even more horrified but calmly nods, understanding the situation.]
Meanwhile, in the real world, Katara, Sokka, and Yue arrive to where the ice broke earlier. In the cave, Zuko is keeping warm with Breath of Fire while Aang, now tied up, remains in the Spirit World.
Zuko: I finally have you, but I can't get you home because of this blizzard. [Stands up and looks outside the cave.] There's always something. Not that you would understand. You're like my sister. Everything always came easy to her. She's a firebending prodigy, and everyone adores her. My father says she was born lucky. He says I was lucky to be born. I don't need luck, though. I don't want it. I've always had to struggle and fight and that's made me strong. It's made me who I am.
Meanwhile, back at the invasion, the Fire Nation has breached part of the wall. On the lead ship, Zhao and Iroh are speaking.
Iroh: I don't need to remind you we have a time limit. If we don't defeat the Water Tribe before the full moon rises, they will be undefeatable.
Zhao: I assure you I have everything under control. I intend to remove the moon as a factor.
Iroh: [Shocked.] Remove the moon? How?
Hahn appears behind them and points his spear at Zhao.
Hahn: Admiral Choi! Prepare to meet your fate!
He charges at Zhao, who casually tosses him overboard as he is still screaming. A loud splash is heard, while Iroh shakes his head in disappointment.
Zhao: [Continuing as if nothing happened.] As I was saying, years ago I stumble upon a great and powerful secret: the identity of the Moon Spirit's mortal form.
Iroh: What?
Zhao: I was a young lieutenant serving under General Shu in the Earth Kingdom. [Fade to a flashback of a young Zhao tearing through scrolls in a library.] I discovered a hidden library. Underground, in fact. I tore through scroll after scroll. One of them contained a detailed illustration, and the words "moon" and "ocean". I knew then that these spirits could be found and killed. [The memory ends with a close up of Zhao's eyes, fade to the present.] And that it was my destiny to do so.
Iroh: [Somewhat angrily.] Zhao, the spirits are not to be trifled with!
Zhao: Yes, yes ... I know you fear the spirits, Iroh. I've heard rumors about your journey into the Spirit World. But the Ocean and Moon gave up their immortality to become a part of our world. And now they will face the consequences.
Back in the Spirit World, Aang walks up a giant tree, seeing the entrance to the cave Koh can be found in. Aang stares and slightly steps toward the cave hearing creepy noises. He glances to his left noticing that the noise wasn't coming from the cave. Aang sighs in relief.
Aang: You're just a curly tailed blue nose.
The monkey turns its head toward Aang, exposing that he has no face.
Aang: [Startled.] Aaahhh! [Aang takes a deep breath and speaks with his and Avatar Roku's voices combined.] Show no fear. Show no emotion at all.
Aang steps into the cave with a straight face.
Aang: Hello? I-I'm looking for a spirit named 'Koh'.
As Aang says the spirit's name, some "roots" on the ceiling begin to move. Aang looks around, sensing movement, but sees nothing. Cut to a close-up of Aang's face that pans slightly left, leaving the right hand portion of the screen over his shoulder momentarily empty. A moment later, a white face appears with gray patches around its eyes and luscious, blood-red lips. Cut to a close-up of the lips, which smile. Cut to a profile of Aang, his face emotionless. Suddenly, a huge centipede-like body arcs around Aang and appears in front of his face. The white, clown-like face of Koh is inches away from Aang. Around the spirit's face are eight additional legs.
Koh: [Creepily, circling Aang.] Welcome!
Aang keeps his face straight. Cut to a long shot; the spirit hangs from the ceiling in front of Aang, who bows with his hands clasped in front of him in a gesture of honor.
Aang: [Emotionlessly.] Thank you. [Koh wheels around Aang to look at him from behind. His voice is low and melodic, almost purring.]
Koh: My old friend, the Avatar. It's been a long time.
Aang: You know me?
Koh: [Now facing the camera, away from Aang.] How could I forget [He switches with a "winking" effect, as if some sort of nictitating membrane closes briefly over the old face to reveal a new one, to a mad face of a middle-aged, mustached man with thick eyebrows, long mustache, and beard; angrily.] you? One of your previous incarnations tried to slay me! Nearly eight or nine hundred years ago.
Aang: [Confused, yet seriously.] I didn't know that. Why did he, or I, try to kill you?
Koh: [Switches to Ummi's scared, sad face.] Oh, it was something about stealing the face of someone you loved. [Cut to a close-up of Aang with the camera slowing, zooming in on his face. Cut back to Koh, whose face turns malicious and switches to a baboon's while laughing. Switch to a side-shot; Aang keeps a straight face while not taking his eyes off Koh as he circles around him.] Of course, that's all behind us. Why should I hold a grudge against you for something in a past life? After all, you're a different person now. [Speaks into Aang's ear from behind.] You've come to me ... with a new face.
Aang closes his eyes and takes a deep breath to the words into his ear, crossing the scene to the real world, Zuko seeing his breath.
Zuko: Guess we'll be here awhile.
Cut to exterior of the cave. Cut to Appa in the blizzard.
Yue: Don't worry, Prince Zuko can't be getting too far in this weather.
Katara: I'm not worried they'll get away in the blizzard. I'm worried that they won't.
Sokka: They're not going to die in this blizzard. If we know anything, it's that Zuko never gives up. They'll survive, and we'll find them.
The screen flashes white back to the Spirit World to Aang's talk with the face stealer, Koh circling loosely around Aang.
Koh: [Continues to circle around Aang.] It's been a long time since I've added a child's face to my collection. [His face is now that of an owl.] So ... how may I help you?
Aang: I need to find the moon and the ocean.
Koh: Their spirit names are Tui and La, push and pull. And that has been the nature of their relationship for all time.
Aang: [Side-view of Aang.] Please. Help me find them. An entire culture could be destroyed if I don't get their help. [Top-down view of Koh who changes his face to that of an old man. Aang is visible below him.]
Koh: Oh, you think you need their help. [Koh looks to the side.] Actually it's quite the other way round. [In an instant, Koh turns and bolts to Aang, stopping just short of the young Avatar; with an angry blue ogre-like face with red eyes and upright fangs.] Someone's going to kill them! [Aang closes his eyes briefly before opening them to look at Koh.]
Aang: What do you mean? How can I find them and protect them?
Koh: [Flipping back to his white face.] You've already met them, actually. [View of Koh from behind Aang as Koh moves to look away, turning his back on Aang.] Tui and La, your moon and ocean, have always circled each other in an eternal dance. They balance each other, push and pull, life and death, [Close-up of Aang's face.] good and evil, yin and yang.
Aang's eyes open wide as he experiences a flashback of the white and black fish circling each other in the pond and the vision he had of them as they turned into the yin and yang symbol just before he entered the Spirit World. Back to Aang.
Aang: [Excitedly.] The koi fish! [Hearing the emotion in Aang's voice, Koh quickly reels around to stare at the now expressionless face of Aang.] I must be going now.
Koh: [Flipping to the face of a bald, young man.] We'll meet again.
Koh recedes into the shadows as Aang walks out of his cave. Cut to Aang running in front of the tree that is Koh's lair. He stops and talks to the ground.
Aang: The spirits are in trouble, I need to get back to the physical world.
Roku: [Cut to Roku's image on the ground.] A friend is here, to guide you back.
Aang: [Aang turns around; excitedly.] Hei Bai!
The spirit groans as Aang jumps onto him and sets off. Cut back to the physical world. Two fireballs hit the city. Cut to two Water Tribe members fleeing as a tank destroys a totem pole behind them. Cut to two Water Tribe members trying to stop a tank. Cut to a view of the ocean with many fire navy ships and the moon looming behind. Cut to a bridge as two fire navy soldiers move in front of the camera as a waterbender drops down to move the bridge back from where the fire navy soldiers came from, taking the soldiers with it. Cut to a waterbender facing a tank, submerging the tank in the snow and ice around it. Cut to waterbenders attacking fire navy soldiers with shards of ice, who use shields to protect themselves. Cut to a shot behind Pakku who freezes and takes down eight oncoming soldiers. Pakku dodges a fire blast, having become surrounded with tanks and soldiers. Unleashing a wave of water he slices tanks wheels off and freezes soldiers behind him in ice. Pakku lifts himself into the air with water while being fired upon by firebenders. Avoiding the blasts, he knocks the firebenders away using his water cyclone as a wave. Cut to waterbenders sending a tank flying toward Zhao.
Zhao: We'll be following this map to a very special location. And when we get there, we're going fishing. [He smirks.]
Cut back to the Spirit World. Aang arrives at his starting location and jumps off Hei Bai.
Aang: This is where I came in, but how do I get back?
Hei Bai stands on his hind legs and sends a beam of energy at Aang, who disappears to the physical world.
Baboon spirit: [Cut to baboon spirit sitting on a rock. Opening his eyes.] Good riddance.
Hei Bai, having assumed his monstrous form, shoots an intense beam from his mouth at the baboon spirit sending it flying, before reverting to his original form. Back in the physical world, cut to a view of the arch way and water.
Aang: Momo! [Walking toward Momo. Closer view of Aang with Momo.] Momo. Oh no, where's my body?
Aang is surrounded by energy and flies into the air. Cut to a wide-view of the entire Water Tribe city as Aang continues to fly toward the cave. Cut to close shot of Katara. Noticing Aang she turns around. Cut to shot of Appa flying in the sky as Aang shoots past overhead to the cave.
Katara: Look, that's gotta be Aang! Yip-yip!
Cut to Aang entering the cave, filling it with light. Cut to Aang waking up, attempting to get out of his restraints and noticing Zuko.
Zuko: Welcome back.
Aang: [Cut to close-up of Aang as he narrows his eyes.] It's good to be back.
Aang airbends Zuko into a wall and propelling himself backward out of the cave. Cut to cave exterior. Close-up of Aang wriggling like a worm in an attempt to get away, only to be caught by Zuko.
Zuko: [Zuko pulls Aang up by his collar as seen from behind Aang.] That won't be enough to escape.
Aang: [On seeing Appa.] Appa!
Appa lands. Katara slides off. Close-up of Zuko.
Zuko: [Throwing the tied-up Aang aside who yelps.] Here for a rematch?
Katara: [Confidently while countering his fire blasts.] Trust me Zuko, it's not going to be much of a match.
Katara uses waterbending to launch Zuko into the air before plummeting him down to the ground, knocking him out. Close-up shot of Sokka running toward Aang to untie him with Zuko lying unconscious.
Sokka: Hey, this is some quality rope!
Aang: We need to get to the oasis; the spirits are in trouble!
Switch to a wide-view of the area with Aang airbending himself atop Appa. Close-up shot of Aang landing on Appa.
Aang: Wait, we can't just leave him here.
Sokka: Sure we can. Let's go.
Aang: No, if we leave him he'll die.
Aang airbends himself off Appa and retrieves Zuko, bringing him to Appa.
Sokka: [Sarcastically.] Yeah, this makes a lot of sense. Let's bring the guy who's constantly trying to kill us.
Appa takes off. Cut to Tui and La in the oasis lake. Zhao grabs Tui from the water, placing it in a sack. The moon goes red, followed by everything else. Cut to close-up of the now red moon. Cut to a view of the entire city turning red. Cut to Pakku who loses his waterbending and falls to the ground. Cut to a waterbender attempting to waterbend but loses his bending. Cut to three more waterbenders, bending water, but they too lose their bending. Cut to Fire Navy soldiers firebending. Cut to Appa flying with the red moon behind him. Appa groans as it cuts to the saddle.
Sokka: [Yue grabs her head as if in pain.] Are you okay?
Yue: I feel faint.
Aang: [Cut to Aang. Holding his head with one hand.] I feel it, too. The Moon Spirit is in trouble.
Yue: [Cut back to the saddle.] I owe the Moon Spirit my life.
Sokka: What do you mean?
Yue: [Close-up of Yue.] When I was born I was very sick and very weak. [Flashback to Yue as a baby.] Most babies cry when they're born, but I was born as if I was asleep, my eyes closed. [Cut to waterbenders attempting to heal Yue as a baby.] Our healers did everything they could. [Panning shot of Yue and the waterbenders, along with Yue's parents.] They told my mother and father I was going to die. [Cut to Arnook staring at the moon.] My father pleaded with the spirits to save me. [Cut to shot panning down from the moon to the oasis.] That night, beneath the full moon, he brought me to the oasis and placed me in the pond. [Cut to Yue being placed into the pond.] My dark hair turned white. [Close-up of Yue in the oasis.] I opened my eyes and began to cry, and they knew I would live. [Cut to Yue in her parents arms with the archway and moon behind them.] That's why my mother named me Yue. [Cut back to Appa's saddle.] For the moon.
Zhao: [Cut to Zhao at the oasis.] I am ... a legend, now! [Cut to panning shot from Zhao's hand, grasping the bag with Tui in it, down to his head.] The Fire Nation will, for generations, tell stories about the great Zhao, who darkened the moon. They will call me, Zhao the Conqueror, Zhao the Moon Slayer, Zhao the Invincible! [Momo jumps on top of Zhao's head.] Ugh ... Get it off! Get it off!
Cut to wide-view of oasis as Momo flies away toward the camera. Panning view of Momo landing on Aang's arm and running to his shoulder, with Katara and Sokka are behind him. Cut to Zhao and his soldiers, readying themselves for battle. Cut to Aang, Sokka and Katara readying themselves. Panning shot of the oasis.
Zhao: Don't bother. [Close-up of Zhao as he lifts the sack up threatening to kill Tui.]
Aang: [Cut to Aang and the others surrendering.] Zhao, don't!
Zhao: [Cut to panning side-view.] It's my destiny, to destroy the moon and the Water Tribe.
Aang: [Close-up side-view of Aang.] Destroying the moon won't hurt just the Water Tribe. [Close-up panning shot of the sack with Tui inside and Zhao.] It will hurt everyone, including you. [Cut to panning shot of the oasis.] Without the moon, everything would fall out of balance. You have no idea what kind of chaos that would unleash on the world. [Cut to Zhao.]
Iroh: [Off-screen.] He is right Zhao.
Zhao: [Cut to wide shot of oasis; calmly to Iroh.] General Iroh, why am I not surprised to discover your treachery?
Iroh: [Close-up of Iroh while he takes off his hood.] I'm no traitor, Zhao, the Fire Nation needs the moon, too; we all depend on the balance. Whatever you do to that spirit I'll unleash on you ten-fold. Let it go, now!
Zhao releases the koi fish into the oasis. Cut to close-up of Zhao as he hesitates before striking the koi fish with a fire slice out of anger. Cut to wide-view of the oasis.

Cut to show La circling the now dead Tui. Cut to Aang and the others looking on in disbelief and moving toward the water. Yue is seen looking on; her forward movement reveals that Zuko has escaped from behind her. Iroh picks up the dead koi fish.
Yue: [Close-up of Yue and Sokka.] There's no hope now, it's over.
Aang: [Close-up of Aang entering the Avatar State.] No, it's not over.
