HUNK says: "What just happened?"
LANCE says: "I don't know, but we gotta stay together."
LANCE says: "Hunk, you okay?"
LANCE says: "Hunk?"
HUNK says: "I'm fine."
LANCE says: "You just threw up, didn't you?"
LANCE says: "Yeah."
HUNK says: "You would too if you got sucked out of a wormhole at light speed, then crash-landed on an ice planet and ended up underwater."
LANCE says: "That is what happened to me!"
HUNK says: "Oh, right."
LANCE says: "My main system is down."
LANCE says: "The crash must have screwed it up."
LANCE says: "Does yours work?"
HUNK says: "I'm on reserve power."
HUNK says: "My lion's pretty much dead in the water."
LANCE says: "This situation's bad enough, Hunk."
LANCE says: "Don't make it worse with puns."
HUNK says: "I'm just shocked we hit a planet."
HUNK says: "I thought Pidge said space was 90% empty."
LANCE says: "Well, apparently, Pidge's science is wrong."
HUNK says: "We need to contact the others and get back to group immediately."
HUNK says: "Hello, anyone?"
HUNK says: "This is Hunk and Lance of the Yellow and Blue Lions."
LANCE says: "They know the color of our lions!"
LANCE says: "Oh, right."
HUNK says: "Okay, yeah."
HUNK says: "I always forget that."
HUNK says: "My bad."
LANCE says: "e gotta check for damage and get these lions running."
HUNK says: "Copy that."
LANCE says: "Oh, good."
LANCE says: "The Blue Lion's coming back online now."
LANCE says: "Welcome back, beautiful."
LANCE says: "Uh Hunk, did did you just see something swim by?"
LANCE says: "What?"
LANCE says: "No."
LANCE says: "No way!"
LANCE says: "This is going to sound crazy, but I think I just saw a mermaid."
HUNK says: "Oh, boy."
HUNK says: "Okay, how hard did you bang your head when we hit the planet?"
LANCE says: "Dude, I'm serious!"
LANCE says: "Look!"
LANCE says: "There it is again!"
LANCE says: "Hey, come here!"
LANCE says: "Where you going?"
LANCE says: "Hey, slow down!"
HUNK says: "Lance, knock it off."
HUNK says: "We have to stay focused and get to the others..."
HUNK says: "You're outside of your lion."
HUNK says: "Great."
LANCE says: "I know we have to find the others."
LANCE says: "I'm just saying maybe this thing can help."
LANCE says: "Also, it's a mermaid."
LANCE says: "A mermaid!"
LANCE says: "Come on, let's find it."
HUNK says: "No."
HUNK says: "No way."
HUNK says: "Nope."
HUNK says: "Not going out there."
LANCE says: "Okay, you stay here, by yourself, in the dark, all alone in a lion that's out of commission."
HUNK says: "Don't leave me!"
LANCE says: "Come on!"
HUNK says: "I can't believe this!"
HUNK says: "We're really chasing a mermaid."
LANCE says: "Hey, wait, wait, wait!"
LANCE says: "We're friendly!"
LANCE says: "and *HUNK: Whoa!"
FLORONA says: "Hello."
FLORONA says: "Welcome to my village."
FLORONA says: "Here, all are safe and warm."
Both Lance and Hunk scream as Walrus looking creatures close by.
FLORONA says: "Please, do not startle our guests."
FLORONA says: "I am Florona."
FLORONA says: "The almighty Queen Luxia, keeper of our land, would love to meet with you."
LANCE says: "Wait."
LANCE says: "How did your queen know we were here?"
FLORONA says: "Queen Luxia knows all."
HUNK says: "Lance, I know this mermaid thing is a dream of yours, but we really gotta go."
LANCE says: "We will, big guy, we will, but let's meet this queen first."
LANCE says: "Besides, maybe she can help us."
LANCE says: "And, if I just happen to find the future Mrs."
LANCE says: "Blue Lion, well, then that is all right with me."
Queen Luxia says: "Space travelers, I am Queen Luxia."
Queen Luxia says: "I welcome you to our village as honored guests."
LANCE says: "The honor's all ours."
LANCE says: "I'm La-a-a-ance."
HUNK says: "Uh, Mrs."
HUNK says: "Queen, Your Honor, Your Excellence, I'm Hunk, and me and my buddy here, we crash-landed on your lovely planet, but we really need to get back in touch with our friends who are in space."
HUNK says: "Would you possibly have any way of doing that?"
Queen Luxia says: "Hunk, Lance, I can solve all of your problems."
Queen Luxia says: "Here, we are all safe and warm."
HUNK says: "You use magic, don't you?"
HUNK says: "I bet this castle's a ship."
HUNK says: "This castle is a ship, am I right?"
HUNK says: "Just don't say anything if I'm right."
Queen Luxia says: "Here, I've brought you these."
Queen Luxia says: "The bubble coral will provide you with all the air you need."
HUNK says: "Whoa-ho-ho!"
HUNK says: "Thank you, Fish Queen."
HUNK says: "Huh."
HUNK says: "Cool."
Queen Luxia says: "And rest assured, your space vessels will be well protected."
Queen Luxia says: "Now, please, follow me."
LANCE says: "What is that?"
LANCE says: "That is the giver of life to our people, the Baku Garden."
LANCE says: "When the waters froze over, we were forced to live down here."
LANCE says: "The garden provides us the warmth and food we need to survive."
LANCE says: "Because of it, we are taken care of."
LANCE says: "Here, all are safe and warm."
HUNK says: "Your Royalness."
HUNK says: "if I may, this food is amazing."
HUNK says: "It's even better than Balmeran cave bugs."
Queen Luxia says: "I'm glad you enjoy it."
Queen Luxia says: "It was picked fresh from the Baku Garden."
Queen Luxia says: "And I hope you enjoy the entertainment."
LANCE says: "Whoa."
HUNK says: "So, about us getting in contact with our friends how can you help us?"
Queen Luxia says: "Please, let's discuss that after the dance."
HUNK says: "Whoa, this dance is amazing."
HUNK says: "It's the It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen."
Queen Luxia says: "I'm glad you enjoy it."
Queen Luxia says: "Put your mind at ease."
Queen Luxia says: "Let your consciousness drift like the tide."
HUNK says: "Yes, I will do that."
HUNK says: "I Were Weren't we just talking about something?"
Queen Luxia says: "You were just telling me how much you like it here, how much you wanted to stay forever."
HUNK says: "Oh, that's right."
HUNK says: "Here, we are all safe and warm."
HUNK says: "Lance, I think we should stay here forever."
LANCE says: "Okay."
LANCE says: "I don't need pants."
LANCE says: "I'm a mermaid."
LANCE says: "Huh?"
LANCE says: "Who are?"
PLAXUM says: "Leave him."
BLUMFUMP says: "We have to get out of here."
LANCE says: "Hello?"
LANCE says: "Good morning."
LANCE says: "Where am I?"
PLAXUM says: "He's awake."
LANCE says: "Why am I blindfolded?"
LANCE says: "Is this a game?"
LANCE says: "I like games."
LANCE says: "Wait, where am I?"
LANCE says: "Why am I blindfolded?"
LANCE says: "Is this a game?"
LANCE says: "I hate games!"
PLAXUM says: "It's okay."
LANCE says: "Kill me?"
LANCE says: "Think again!"
PLAXUM says: "Wait!"
PLAXUM says: "Come back!"
PLAXUM says: "Huh?"
PLAXUM says: "Aw!"
PLAXUM says: "Don't hurt me!"
PLAXUM says: "Please, we are not here to hurt you."
PLAXUM says: "We brought you here to ask for your help."
PLAXUM says: "I am Plaxum."
BLUMFUMP says: "Blumfump."
SWIRN says: "Swirn."
LANCE says: "Are you saying names, or is this some kind of weird spell you're putting on me?"
PLAXUM says: "We believe you are our savior."
LANCE says: "You guys think I'm your savior?"
LANCE says: "What do you want with me?"
LANCE says: "The queen is mind-swishing everyone, controlling their thoughts."
BLUMFUMP says: "We believe you can stop her."
HUNK says: "Lance?"
HUNK says: "Lance, you around?"
HUNK says: "Lance?"
FLORONA says: "Is everything all right?"
HUNK says: "I can't find Lance."
HUNK says: "Also, there's a hole in our wall."
Queen Luxia says: "There was a break-in."
Queen Luxia says: "Those cave-dwellers must have taken him."
FLORONA says: "Them again?"
FLORONA says: "What should we do?"
Queen Luxia says: "Those meddling mermaids are harmless, but the air-breather could prove troublesome if he doesn't fall back under our control."
HUNK says: "Wait."
HUNK says: "Wait, wait, wait."
HUNK says: "Who needs to fall under our control?"
HUNK says: "Is Lance gone?"
HUNK says: "We gotta find Lance."
Queen Luxia says: "And we will."
Queen Luxia says: "Don't worry your little mind about it."
Queen Luxia says: "But first, we need to sit down and eat, talk, clear our heads."
HUNK says: "No, I'm not really sure if I can eat right now."
HUNK says: "If Lance has been taken..."
HUNK says: "Oh, boy."
HUNK says: "That.."
HUNK says: "That is good, though."
Queen Luxia says: "See?"
Queen Luxia says: "That's all you need."
Queen Luxia says: "Here, we are all safe and warm."
HUNK says: "Okay."
Queen Luxia says: "They are going to come."
Queen Luxia says: "We must destroy what remains of their kind and bring Lance under our control."
Queen Luxia says: "But first, Florona, you were in charge of watching the air-breathers."
Queen Luxia says: "So, now, it is time for you to take a swim in the garden."
FLORONA says: "Yes, My Queen."
LANCE says: "Wait."
LANCE says: "Wait a minute."
LANCE says: "Okay."
LANCE says: "You're trying to tell me the queen is brainwashing people?"
LANCE says: "But she's so safe and warm."
SWIRN says: "What do you remember from yesterday?"
LANCE says: "I remember we crashed, saw the mermaids and the village, then we had dinner, and then, uh we, uh."
SWIRN says: "You can't remember because you were under her control."
BLUMFUMP says: "Our theory is, the queen controls minds by using her voice to strike certain head switches in your ear pan."
PLAXUM says: "And her magnetic stare locks on to your eye-to-brain pathway plug."
SWIRN says: "Plus, her mind-control sonar is always broadcasting through the waters."
SWIRN says: "Bong!"
SWIRN says: "Bong!"
SWIRN says: "Bong!"
PLAXUM says: "And She trains her people to use hypnotic movements to lull you under her control."
LANCE says: "I do remember a dancer."
BLUMFUMP says: "Good, because I haven't finished my picture for that one."
BLUMFUMP says: "But you see, she was infecting your brain!"
LANCE says: "Holy crow!"
LANCE says: "I had a mind-controlling brain infection!"
PLAXUM says: "Sit."
BLUMFUMP says: "The entire village is under the queen's mind control."
BLUMFUMP says: "The only reason we aren't is because we wear these jellyfish that hide our brains from her powers."
BLUMFUMP says: "It's like we have no brains whatsoever."
BLUMFUMP says: "You can't control what doesn't exist."
LANCE says: "Right."
LANCE says: "Of course."
BLUMFUMP says: "Our heads are completely empty."
LANCE says: "Yeah, I get it."
SWIRN says: "Many years ago, the queen froze over the surface by blocking the thermal vents."
SWIRN says: "She forced everyone to the depths, where she began to brainwash them."
SWIRN says: "They became her prisoners."
PLAXUM says: "What size?"
SWIRN says: "Eight and seven-eighths aquameters."
LANCE says: "But what's the point?"
LANCE says: "Why mind-control the mermaids?"
BLUMFUMP says: "To kill them!"
LANCE says: "Really?"
BLUMFUMP says: "Well, we don't know that for sure, but hundreds of mermaids have disappeared and never come back."
Queen Luxia says: "Goodbye, Florona."
Queen Luxia says: "It is time to return to the giver of life."
SWIRN says: "We've tried to take out the queen, but failed several times."
SWIRN says: "And every attempt depletes our numbers."
SWIRN says: "Now, there are only three of us left."
SWIRN says: "Without you, there is no hope."
PLAXUM says: "Found one!"
LANCE says: "What do you want from me?"
BLUMFUMP says: "We saw the mer-cat you came in."
BLUMFUMP says: "We think it can stand up against the queen and her forces."
BLUMFUMP says: "But first, you'll need one of these."
PLAXUM says: "Now, they sting pretty bad and don't smell great."
BLUMFUMP says: "If my theory is correct, the smelliest ones block the most mind-control rays."
LANCE says: "Are you a scientist?"
BLUMFUMP says: "No."
PLAXUM says: "Also, they can sometimes make your face swell, and you might experience hearing loss."
LANCE says: "Would you just put it on, already?"
LANCE says: "It burns!"
PLAXUM says: "That means it's working!"
LANCE says: "So, what's the plan?"
BLUMFUMP says: "Here's what Blumfump came up with."
BLUMFUMP says: "This is you."
BLUMFUMP says: "You act like you're still thought-swirled and get past the guards."
BLUMFUMP says: "Get your mer-cat and grab the queen."
BLUMFUMP says: "We'll mount a full-scale attack on the castle and free the people."
LANCE says: "Then, I'll be a hero."
LANCE says: ""Oh, Lance, you're so handsome!"
LANCE says: ""  "And modest."
LANCE says: ""  "Oh, thank you for saving us."
LANCE says: "Can I kiss you?"
LANCE says: "", "Maybe just a little."
BLUMFUMP says: "Well, now, you're just making a tree kiss a turtle."
LANCE says: "That's a turtle?"
LANCE says: "But there's an actual turtle right here."
BLUMFUMP says: "We needed the turtle to play the wall."
BLUMFUMP says: "If your acting fails you, this holds three doses of antidote to use on the guards."
BLUMFUMP says: "It should interrupt the queen's mind-control long enough for you to escape."
LANCE says: "I don't think I'll be needing this."
LANCE says: "I missed 14 days of the third grade for a stomachache I never really had."
LANCE says: "Hello, mer-guards!"
LANCE says: "Isn't everything just so safe and warm here?"
LANCE says: "Anyway, I'm off to my lion."
LANCE says: "Oh, come on!"
Queen Luxia says: "I had a feeling you'd come for your vessel."
Queen Luxia says: "Servant, take Lance to the Baku Garden."
LANCE says: "Hunk?"
LANCE says: "Hey, buddy, it's me!"
LANCE says: "Snap out of it!"
LANCE says: "It's Lance!"
LANCE says: "Darn it!"
Queen Luxia says: "Everyone, capture him!"
LANCE says: "Hunk, please!"
LANCE says: "I don't want to hurt you!"
HUNK says: "Must keep Queen safe and warm."
HUNK says: "Whoa!"
HUNK says: "Whoa!"
HUNK says: "Where am I?"
HUNK says: "What am I doing?"
HUNK says: "Is that a jellyfish on your head?"
LANCE says: "Hunk, you've been mind-controlled by the queen and you're trying to kill me."
HUNK says: "Oh, really?"
HUNK says: "Sorry."
HUNK says: "My bad."
LANCE says: "We're kind of in the middle of a battle."
LANCE says: "So, I'm going to need your help."
HUNK says: "Got it."
LANCE says: "Oh!"
HUNK says: "Uh Uh Uh."
LANCE says: "Huh?"
HUNK says: "Now, who are these weirdos?"
LANCE says: "Those weirdos are with us."
PLAXUM says: "Come, we must hurry to your mer-cats."
LANCE says: "You hanging on?"
LANCE says: "Yes!"
PLAXUM says: "Let's go!"
PLAXUM says: "What's the plan?"
PLAXUM says: "We need to grab the queen and take her to an ice prison Blumfump built, where her mind-control powers will be trapped because of the thick ice and the jellyfish."
HUNK says: "Okay, who's that?"
LANCE says: "It's Plaxum."
LANCE says: "Just go with it."
HUNK says: "There she is!"
LANCE says: "Got her!"
Queen Luxia says: "Where am I?"
Queen Luxia says: "What's going on?"
PLAXUM says: "What's going on is you're not mind-controlling these people anymore, Your Majesty."
Queen Luxia says: "What?"
Queen Luxia says: "Mind-control?"
Queen Luxia says: "Me?"
Queen Luxia says: "No!"
Queen Luxia says: "Please, my people are in danger!"
Queen Luxia says: "You must go back!"
Queen Luxia says: "What's going on?"
PLAXUM says: "Nothing!"
PLAXUM says: "It's a ruse."
LANCE says: "Are you sure?"
Queen Luxia says: "I wasn't controlling anyone."
Queen Luxia says: "The Baku!"
PLAXUM says: "She's lying!"
Queen Luxia says: "I'm not."
Queen Luxia says: "Please!"
Queen Luxia says: "The last thing I remember is that organism in the garden falling from space."
Queen Luxia says: "I went to inspect it."
Queen Luxia says: "I thought it was a plant."
HUNK says: "Wait a second."
HUNK says: "We've been eating that plant."
HUNK says: "And it's delicious!"
HUNK says: "It's so safe and warm."
LANCE says: "A-ha!"
LANCE says: "Mind-swishing!"
LANCE says: "It was the plant the whole time."
LANCE says: "And the queen was the first one to be mind-controlled."
PLAXUM says: "But why?"
Queen Luxia says: "The Baku has been harvesting us all."
Queen Luxia says: "We are its food source."
LANCE says: "No way!"
HUNK says: "I think she's telling the truth."
HUNK says: "Look out the window."
LANCE says: "You two get somewhere safe."
LANCE says: "Okay, Hunk, change of plans."
LANCE says: "The queen is actually good and that thing is bad."
LANCE says: "Let's take it out."
HUNK says: "That thing's too quick for me."
HUNK says: "I can't hit it!"
HUNK says: "My lion's not very good in water."
LANCE says: "Really?"
LANCE says: "My lion's moving better than ever."
LANCE says: "There's something about fighting underwater that's making me feel extra quick and powerful."
LANCE says: "I think I know how to stop that thing."
HUNK says: "How?"
LANCE says: "We gotta stop shooting where the creature is and start shooting where the creature's gonna be."
LANCE says: "I got it!"
LANCE says: "Now, the hunter becomes Oh, no, he's free!"
LANCE says: "What?"
LANCE says: "Here goes nothing!"
LANCE says: "This place is coming down!"
LANCE says: "Let's get out of here!"
HUNK says: "Dude, you just dropped a sonic boom on him!"
LANCE says: "So, Blumfump, the jellyfish, the magnetic stare, the hypnotic dance You got it all wrong."
LANCE says: "It was the food."
BLUMFUMP says: "Well, I did say they were theories."
BLUMFUMP says: "Mer-science isn't always about getting the right answer."
Queen Luxia says: "I want to thank you all for what you've done."
Queen Luxia says: "You've freed my people, and I will do all I can to protect that freedom."
Queen Luxia says: "I vow to be the voice of my people."
Queen Luxia says: "I beg of you to help."
Queen Luxia says: "Will you be my advisors?"
BLUMFUMP says: "Of course, Your Highness."
BLUMFUMP says: "I have some great ideas."
BLUMFUMP says: "Have you ever heard of electricity?"
PLAXUM says: "And I wanted to personally thank you, Lance."
PLAXUM says: "Mwah."
PLAXUM says: "Finally, I can remove this thing."
LANCE says: "Whoa!"
HUNK says: "Queen Luxia, the reason we came here in the first place was to see if you could help us find our friends."
Queen Luxia says: "Of course."
Queen Luxia says: "It has been many years since we have activated the energy beacon, but perhaps it is time to rebuild our civilization and reach out to interstellar travelers once again."
Queen Luxia says: "Activate energy beacon!"
PIDGE says: "I see the beacon!"
QUEEN LUXIA says: "There is a mer-cat in our system that appears to be heading our way."
HUNK says: "It's the Green Lion!"
LANCE says: "See, Hunk?"
LANCE says: "I told you they could help us."
LANCE says: "Now, the next time I go swimming after a mermaid, I hope you won't be complaining the whole time."
HUNK says: "Lesson learned."
