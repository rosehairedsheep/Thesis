ALLURA says: ""Thank you, Your Majesty, for that..."
ALLURA says: "wonderful production."
ALLURA says: "It saddens me that we must leave tomorrow, but we must continue our battle with Zarkon and spread peace throughout the universe."
ALLURA gives the ARUSIAN KING an Altean communicator.
ALLURA says: ""Your Highness..."
ALLURA says: "please accept this gift."
ALLURA says: "This will allow you to contact us anytime you need help."
ALLURA says: "Arus will be the first planet in the Voltron Alliance."
Arusian King says: ""Hoorah!"
The ARUSIAN KING holds up the communicator; the Arusians cheer. HUNK approaches KEITH and LANCE.
HUNK says: ""We ought to get something like that."
LANCE says: ""Like what?"
HUNK says: ""You know, like, a cheer."
HUNK says: "Like, a team cheer that we do."
LANCE says: ""Mm-hmm."
LANCE says: "Yeah, okay."
LANCE says: "How about, uh..."
LANCE says: "I say 'Vol' and you say 'Tron."
LANCE says: "' Vol—"
LANCE says: "!"
KEITH says: ""Uh..."
KEITH says: "Vol-tron?"
LANCE says: ""No!"
LANCE says: "No, no, no, no, no."
LANCE says: "The cheer includes the instructions."
LANCE says: "I say 'Vol' and you say..."
KEITH says: ""..."
KEITH says: "Vol-tron?"
LANCE says: ""..."
LANCE says: "We'll work on it."
KEITH shrugs at HUNK. LANCE drinks Nunvill and is disgusted.
LANCE says: ""Coran, what is this?"
CORAN says: ""Oh, this is Nunvill, the nectar of the gods."
LANCE says: ""It tastes like hot dog water and feet."
CORAN says: ""Yeah, makes a wonderful hair tonic as well."
CORAN sprinkles Nunvill on his mustache and it grows luxurious. LANCE retches; KEITH and HUNK prod at him until he falls. CORAN approaches SHIRO, who is watching the Castle's entrance.
CORAN says: ""Not feeling well?"
CORAN says: "Try some Nunvill."
CORAN says: "Settles the stomach and brightens your smile."
SHIRO says: ""I'm not sure we should be letting everyone wander in and out of the Castle like this."
SHIRO says: "It doesn't seem safe."
CORAN says: ""Oh, these Arusians won't hurt anything—"
CORAN sees Arusians playing with a hover platter.
CORAN says: ""..."
CORAN says: "Much."
CORAN cringes at the sound of them crashing.
CORAN says: ""Besides, it's only fair to let them see the inside of a Castle that's been sitting on their planet for so long."
SHIRO says: ""But who knows when Zarkon will attack again?"
SHIRO says: "I'm going to do a perimeter check, just in case."
SHIRO exits the Castle.
The Commander Lives.
Near the Castle of Lions, SENDAK watches the Castle with HAXUS.
HAXUS says: ""Commander Sendak, the Sentries are in position around the Arusian village."
SENDAK says: ""Luck is on our side."
SENDAK says: "Look, the Castle defenses are down."
SENDAK says: "The door is wide open."
SENDAK says: "With all these Arusians coming in and out, it should be nothing for you to infiltrate."
HAXUS spies PIDGE With ROVER.
HAXUS says: ""I may not have to."
HAXUS says: "Look."
HAXUS says: "The small one has a Galra drone they've repurposed."
HAXUS says: "If I can just get close enough to clone its signature code, I can send our bomb drone in undetected."
SENDAK says: ""I knew you would not disappoint me, Haxus."
HAXUS leaves for the Castle.
An Uncertain Team.
In the Castle vestibule, ALLURA watches the Paladins with the Altean Mice.
ALLURA says: ""Look at them, the new Paladins of Voltron."
ALLURA says: "The fate of the universe is on their shoulders."
KEITH drinks Nunvill but finds it foul so he spits it out on HUNK. HUNK turns away and then reveals Arusian food stuck to his eyes.
HUNK says: ""Ow, my eyes!"
KEITH and HUNK laugh; ALLURA is unimpressed.
ALLURA says: ""..."
ALLURA says: "I must portray strength, so no one can tell how concerned I am about the fate of our mission."
The blue mouse with red eyes squeaks.
ALLURA says: ""Let's..."
ALLURA says: "keep that a secret."
The mouse squeaks again.
ALLURA says: ""Who else has secrets?"
The blue mouse with red eyes uses another mice as a demonstration.
ALLURA says: ""Hunk tried to eat what?"
ALLURA says: "That is rather amusing."
ALLURA says: "What other secrets?"
The blue mouse with blue eyes pretends to be LANCE shooting things and posing.
ALLURA says: ""That seems like Lance."
The blue mouse with blue eyes pretends to look adorable.
ALLURA says: ""Pidge is a what!"
ALLURA says: "?"
ALLURA watches PIDGE secretly put alien food in a backpack and pick an ear with a stick, sniff it, and retch.
ALLURA says: ""Hmm..."
ALLURA says: "Are you sure?"
The mouse nods.
ALLURA says: ""I'm getting to the bottom of this."
LANCE and HUNK are talking at the party.
LANCE says: ""I guess we should get used to this space juice."
LANCE says: "Who knows when we'll get back home again?"
HUNK says: ""Yeah, if ever."
LANCE says: ""What do you mean?"
HUNK says: ""I mean, if this Zarkon guy has been ruling for 10,000 years, how long do you think it will take for us to fix it?"
HUNK says: "You know, if we live."
LANCE says: ""Right."
LANCE says: "That."
HUNK looks at the alien food he's grabbed.
HUNK says: ""Hey, what do you think the chances are of us landing on a nacho planet?"
LANCE says: ""Well, there's only one planet with Veradera Beach,  pizza shack looking over the water, and the garlic knots and..."
LANCE says: "my mom's hugs..."
LANCE starts to tear up.
LANCE says: ""I'm sorry."
LANCE says: "I think this Nunvill is getting to me."
LANCE says: "I gotta go."
LANCE leaves HUNK confused; CORAN witnesses.
The Detective Princess.
ALLURA approaches PIDGE who is followed by ROVER.
ALLURA says: ""So, Pidge, we haven't had a chance to really..."
ALLURA says: "talk."
ALLURA says: "Tell me about yourself."
PIDGE says: ""Hmm..."
PIDGE says: "Well, I like peanut butter, and I like peanut butter cookies, but I hate peanuts."
PIDGE says: "They're so dry."
PIDGE says: "Also, I sweat a lot."
PIDGE says: "I-I mean, in general, unrelated to the peanuts."
PIDGE tries to walk away. ALLURA intervenes.
ALLURA says: ""I-I suppose I was thinking of something a little more personal?"
ALLURA winks.
ALLURA says: ""We have a lot in common."
PIDGE is unimpressed.
PIDGE says: ""Like what?"
ALLURA says: ""Oh, well..."
ALLURA says: "Both of us had our fathers taken away by Zarkon."
PIDGE says: ""Yeah, but I'm going to get mine back."
ALLURA looks pained. PIDGE realizes how harsh that that statement was.
PIDGE says: ""Augh..."
PIDGE says: "Sorry."
PIDGE says: "I-I really didn't mean to—"
ALLURA says: ""No, I understand."
ALLURA says: "I just want you to know that you can confide in me."
ALLURA says: "If there's anything you ever want to talk about..."
PIDGE is silent.
ALLURA says: ""..."
ALLURA says: "Anything."
PIDGE says: ""Huh?"
PIDGE says: "..."
PIDGE says: "Okay."
PIDGE says: "I do have something to tell you."
ALLURA is overjoyed.
ALLURA says: ""I had a feeling~!"
ALLURA says: "What is it?"
PIDGE says: ""I'm leaving Team Voltron."
ALLURA is a about to speak, expecting something else entirely. She stops.
ALLURA says: ""Wait, what?!"
ALLURA says: "!"
PIDGE says: ""I decrypted the information from the Galra ship about where my family might be, or at least where they were."
PIDGE says: "I've made up my mind."
PIDGE says: "I'm leaving tonight."
ALLURA says: ""Pidge, you can't."
ALLURA says: "You're one of five Paladins."
ALLURA says: "You have a sacred trust to defend the universe."
PIDGE says: ""My first priority is to find my family!"
PIDGE says: "I thought you of all people would understand."
PIDGE says: "If you had a chance to get your father back, wouldn't you?"
ALLURA frowns.
PIDGE says: ""I'm sorry."
PIDGE says: "I should go tell everyone else."
PIDGE walks away and finds SHIRO outside the Castle.
PIDGE says: ""Shiro?"
PIDGE says: "I need to talk to you."
PIDGE approaches SHIRO. HAXUS hides among the rocks nearby and scans ROVER for its code.
HAXUS says: ""Signature code cloned."
SHIRO is led inside by PIDGE. HAXUS reconfigures the bomb drone with ROVER's signature.
HAXUS says: ""Bomb activated."
HAXUS leaves as the bomb drone heads inside the Castle.
The Galra Strike.
Where to Call Home.
LANCE sits forlornly in the Bridge of the Castleship. CORAN approaches.
CORAN says: ""Mind if I join you?"
LANCE says: ""How far away from Earth do you think we are, Coran?"
CORAN says: ""Let's take a look."
CORAN brings up a holographic map of the universe to show LANCE.
CORAN says: ""Earth is over here."
CORAN says: "And we're aaaaaaall..."
CORAN says: "the waaaaay..."
CORAN says: "oveeeeer..."
CORAN moves the map and still does not reach ARUS.
LANCE says: ""You ever notice how far the planets are from each other, Coran?"
CORAN says: ""Yes."
CORAN says: "Haven't you been paying attention?"
LANCE approaches the map; Coran stops.
LANCE says: ""Yeah, but I mean, like, they're really, really far away."
LANCE says: "Like, say, Earth?"
LANCE says: "It's so far, I can't even see it."
LANCE says: "The..."
LANCE says: "The blue oceans, the white clouds, green grass..."
LANCE says: "I c—"
LANCE says: "-I-I..."
LANCE says: "I can't see any of it."
CORAN says: ""You miss Earth."
CORAN says: "I understand."
CORAN says: "I miss Altea."
LANCE says: ""I know we're supposed to be brave Paladins and Defenders of the Universe or whatever, but, honestly?"
LANCE says: "I just want to go home."
CORAN says: ""If I could go home, I would."
LANCE says: ""I miss rain, and splashing in puddles."
CORAN says: ""Rain?"
LANCE says: ""Yeah."
LANCE says: "It's water that falls from the sky?"
CORAN says: ""Oh, we had that on Altea."
CORAN says: "Only, it wasn't water, more like rocks."
CORAN says: "Razor-sharp and boiling-hot."
CORAN says: "Oh, they could knock a hole right in your head."
LANCE says: ""Sounds fun."
CORAN says: ""Yeah."
The bomb drone moves through the Castle. PIDGE is speaking with the rest of the team in the halls.
SHIRO says: ""Pidge, no..."
SHIRO says: "!"
PIDGE says: ""The download from the Galra ship was enough to at least get me in the right direction to start my search."
PIDGE says: "I have a pod all ready to go."
KEITH approaches PIDGE.
KEITH says: ""You can't leave!"
PIDGE says: ""You can't tell me what to do!"
KEITH says: ""If you leave, we can't form Voltron."
KEITH says: "And that means we can't defend the universe against Zarkon."
KEITH says: "You're not the only one with a family."
KEITH says: "All these Arusians have families."
KEITH says: "Everyone in the universe has families."
HUNK says: ""Yeah, I have a family."
HUNK says: "They live on Earth."
HUNK says: "I want to be with them."
HUNK says: "Is that—"
HUNK says: "Is that, like, a thing that can happen?"
ALLURA says: ""You want to leave, too?"
HUNK says: ""Of course I do."
HUNK says: "Look, Voltron is super-cool, don't get me wrong, but I never signed up for a lifetime in space fighting aliens."
KEITH is enraged and aggressively closes in on PIDGE.
KEITH says: ""YOU'RE PUTTING THE LIVES OF TWO PEOPLE OVER THE LIVES OF EVERYONE ELSE IN THE ENTIRE GALAXY—"
KEITH says: "!"
SHIRO grabs KEITH by the arm.
SHIRO says: ""—"
SHIRO says: "Keith!"
SHIRO says: "That's not how a team works."
SHIRO says: "People have to want to be a part of it."
SHIRO says: "They can't be forced."
KEITH silently relents. SHIRO turns to PIDGE.
SHIRO says: ""If you want to leave, we won't try to stop you."
SHIRO says: "But, please, just think about what you're doing."
PIDGE looks conflicted, but remains firm.
PIDGE says: ""I'm sorry."
PIDGE says: "You're going to have to find someone else to pilot the Green Lion."
PIDGE leaves with ROVER.
ALLURA says: ""I can't believe it."
ALLURA says: "This team is falling apart."
ALLURA says: "How will we ever form Voltron?"
Crippled Power.
The Galra bomb drone enters the Bridge; LANCE and CORAN are leaving.
LANCE says: ""Hey, Rover."
The Galra bomb drone ignores LANCE and heads to the Power Crystal. LANCE stops.
LANCE says: ""Wait..."
LANCE says: "Where's Pidge?"
LANCE looks at the drone and gasps as it prepares to explode.
LANCE says: ""Coran, look out!"
LANCE launches himself at CORAN as the drone explodes and destroys the Power Crystal so the Castle loses power. The blast is felt throughout the Castle of Lions. The Arusians flee to their village. The rest of the team gathers in the Bridge to find CORAN unharmed.
SHIRO says: ""What happened?!"
SHIRO says: "!"
CORAN says: ""Ugh..."
CORAN says: "I'm not sure."
Smoke clears; ALLURA sees the Power Crystal destroyed.
ALLURA says: ""The Crystal!"
The team sees LANCE unconscious.
ALLURA says: ""Lance!"
SHIRO holds LANCE.
SHIRO says: ""Lance..."
SHIRO says: "?"
SHIRO says: "Lance!"
PIDGE says: ""We have to get Lance to the infirmary!"
ALLURA says: ""Without the Crystal, the Castle has no power."
SHIRO says: ""He doesn't look good."
The ARUSIAN KING enters.
Arusian King says: ""Lion warriors, our village is under attack!"
Arusian King says: "We need help!"
KEITH says: ""Let's get to the Lions!"
ALLURA says: ""You can't."
ALLURA says: "They're sealed in their hangars."
ALLURA says: "There's no way to get them out."
ALLURA says: "We're defenseless."
Arusian King says: ""Will you not help us?"
KEITH says: ""We'll help you."
KEITH says: "We just—"
LANCE groans in pain.
HUNK says: ""This is bad."
CORAN says: ""We have to get a new Crystal to get the Castle working again."
CORAN says: "But, to get a new Crystal, we need a ship."
PIDGE says: ""The pod I was loading, we can use that!"
PIDGE says: "I left the bay door open."
CORAN says: ""I can use the scanner in the pod to see if there's a Balmera nearby."
CORAN says: "Hunk, you come with me."
CORAN says: "I'll need someone big to help me carry the Crystal."
HUNK says: ""A Balmera?"
CORAN says: ""It's where the Crystals come from."
CORAN says: "I'll tell you about it on the way!"
HUNK, PIDGE, and CORAN leave for the flight pod.
KEITH says: ""I'll go see what's happening at the Arusian village."
ALLURA says: ""I'll go with you, Keith."
ALLURA says: "I brought this on the poor Arusians."
SHIRO says: ""I'll tend to Lance and stand watch over the Castle."
ALLURA and KEITH leave with the ARUSIAN KING. In the Flight Pod Hangar, CORAN and HUNK are in a flight pod.
CORAN says: ""It's our first bit of luck."
CORAN says: "There's a source not too far."
CORAN says: "We won't need a Wormhole to get there, thankfully."
PIDGE says: ""I made some modifications to the shuttle."
PIDGE says: "The first change is a cloaking device that I reverse-engineered from the invisible walls on the Training Deck."
PIDGE says: "The second is a tank of booster fuel that I mounted on the fuel line."
CORAN says: ""Using that during flight would turn the whole pod into a bomb!"
HUNK looks terrified.
PIDGE says: ""Okay."
PIDGE says: "Maybe you shouldn't use that modification after all."
HUNK says: ""We ready to hit it?"
CORAN says: ""Right."
CORAN says: "Let's go."
The flight pod prepares to take off. PIDGE gives HUNK and CORAN a thumbs-up.
PIDGE says: ""Good luck."
HUNK gives PIDGE a thumbs-up. The flight pod leaves the Castle.
The Castle Taken.
Shiro vs. Sendak.
SHIRO is carrying LANCE to the Castle's entrance. LANCE is unconscious.
SHIRO says: ""Hang on, buddy."
SHIRO says: "Help is on the way."
SHIRO sees SENDAK approaching.
SHIRO says: ""Sendak!"
SHIRO lays LANCE down and meets SENDAK in front of the Castle.
SENDAK says: ""Stand aside."
SHIRO says: ""No!"
SHIRO says: "You're not getting in."
SHIRO activates his prosthetic arm and prepares to fight.
SENDAK says: ""Yes, I am."
SHIRO furiously battles SENDAK. Both throw a punch and end up locked at the knuckle.
SENDAK says: ""I see you spent some time with the Druids."
SENDAK says: "They do love to experiment."
SENDAK says: "Too bad you didn't get the latest model."
SENDAK launches his gauntlet to send SHIRO back inside the Castle. They continue to fight and end up poised with each other's glowing hand against their throats.
HAXUS says: ""Let him go or your friend won't make it!"
SHIRO sees LANCE is still unconscious and has been captured. SENDAK strikes SHIRO unconscious.
SENDAK says: ""Voltron is ours."
SENDAK leaves for the Bridge. PIDGE is still in the Castle and witnessed the fight.
PIDGE says: ""Oh, no."
PIDGE leaves to elsewhere in the Castle.
The Castle Falls.
KEITH, ALLURA, and the ARUSIAN KING arrive at the burning Arusian village.
ALLURA says: ""What's happening?"
Arusian King says: ""Look!"
Arusian King says: "Attackers!"
The ARUSIAN KING points to Galra Sentries standing among the flames and explosions.
KEITH says: ""I'll go in for a closer look."
KEITH says: "Stay here with them."
ALLURA says: ""Keith!"
KEITH dives into the fray and approaches the Sentries. He sees they are broken decoys.
KEITH says: ""What?"
KEITH says: "Oh, no."
KEITH says: "They tricked us!"
KEITH speaks to ALLURA through her communication earrings.
KEITH says: ""It was just a diversion to separate us and thin the Castle defenses!"
ALLURA looks in shock towards the Castle. Inside, the Galra hook up their own Power Crystal to the Castle of Lions.
SENDAK says: ""Power up the Castle."
The Castle of Lions powers up in Galra violet. A computer screen shows all the Voltron Lions are in place.
SENDAK says: ""The Lions are all in their bays."
SENDAK says: "Raising particle barrier."
SENDAK says: "Begin launch sequence."
The particle barrier activates, preventing KEITH and ALLURA from entering in time. KEITH slams his fist on the barrier.
KEITH says: ""We're too late..."
KEITH says: "No!"
ALLURA says: ""They have control of the Castle."
ALLURA says: "They're taking Voltron!"
SENDAK is in the Castle Bridge.
SENDAK says: ""Make contact with Emperor Zarkon."
HAXUS brings up ZARKON on screen.
ZARKON says: ""Sendak."
SENDAK says: ""My mission is complete."
SENDAK says: "I've captured the Altean castle, along with all of the Voltron Lions."
SENDAK says: "I am currently preparing for launch and will be delivering them all to you shortly."
ZARKON says: ""This news is most pleasing."
ZARKON says: "You have done your duty."
ZARKON says: "Vrepit Sa!"
SENDAK says: ""Vrepit Sa!"
The transmission ends.
SENDAK says: ""Haxus, ready the Castle for takeoff."
HAXUS says: ""Yes, Commander."
Outside, KEITH summons his Bayard into form.
KEITH says: ""Can we break through the barrier?"
ALLURA says: ""No."
ALLURA says: "And whoever has taken the Castle has a Crystal, which means they'll be able to fly the ship."
ALLURA says: "We have to stop them."
KEITH says: ""How are we going to do that?"
PIDGE contacts KEITH through his helmet.
PIDGE says: ""Keith, can you hear me?"
KEITH says: ""Pidge!"
KEITH says: "Is that you?"
KEITH says: "Where are you?"
PIDGE says: ""I'm inside the Castle."
PIDGE says: "Sendak has taken over and he's preparing for launch."
PIDGE says: "He's got Lance and Shiro."
ALLURA says: ""Pidge, listen."
ALLURA says: "If they've started the launch sequence, then we don't have much time before liftoff to stop it."
PIDGE says: ""What do I have to do?"
ALLURA says: ""You have to get down to the main engine control panel and disconnect the primary turbine from the Central Energy Chamber."
ALLURA says: "If you can do that, Sendak will have to reset the whole system."
ALLURA says: "That might give us enough time to find a way to stop them."
PIDGE pulls up a map of the Castleship from the Paladin armor and heads off to do as instructed.
A Living Planet.
CORAN and HUNK arrive at the Balmera.
HUNK says: ""Is this the Balmera planet with the crystals?"
CORAN says: ""It's not a planet."
CORAN says: "Balmera are ancient animals."
CORAN says: "Petrified, but still alive."
CORAN says: "Their bodies naturally create the crystals that help power many Altean ships."
CORAN says: "I often accompanied my grandfather to visit these majestic creatures when he was building the Castle of Lions."
CORAN says: "I'll never forget the first time I saw the sparkling surface of a Balmera."
CORAN says: "You're in for quite a treat."
The Balmera looks nothing like the sparkling image CORAN brings up on screen.
CORAN says: ""Oh, no..."
CORAN says: "This is horrifying."
CORAN says: "The Galra have turned this into a mining colony!"
CORAN says: "Oh, they're completely destroying it!"
CORAN says: "They have no regard for the poor creature!"
HUNK says: ""Uh-oh."
HUNK says: "We've been spotted."
A patrolling Galra fighter jet detects them and tails them.
FIGHTER JET says: ""Hailing unidentified craft."
FIGHTER JET says: "State your ship ID, entry code, and landing destination."
HUNK says: ""Oh, no."
HUNK says: "What do we do?"
CORAN says: ""Just stay calm."
CORAN radios the fighter jet.
CORAN says: ""We don't really need to land."
CORAN says: "Uh, we're just looking around, if that's okay."
FIGHTER JET says: ""Unidentified craft, land immediately and prepare to be boarded."
CORAN says: ""Okay."
CORAN says: "Uh, thank you."
CORAN says: "See you down below."
CORAN ends the transmission and instantly takes off in reverse, pulling some crazy piloting to escape that makes HUNK scream. The fighter jet fires lasers.
CORAN says: ""Not done yet."
CORAN says: "Hang on!"
CORAN sends the flight pod diving into a mining hole at full speed. HUNK continues to scream.
HUNK says: ""Coran!"
HUNK says: "Coran!"
The hole continues as HUNK screams. He finally calms as nothing happens.
HUNK says: ""..."
HUNK says: "..."
HUNK says: "How deep is this thing?"
A Galra structure appears in their path.
HUNK says: ""Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no—"
HUNK says: "!"
The flight pod speeds too fast to avoid the structure and collides, spinning into a crash landing at the bottom of the hole. The flight pod opens; HUNK looks around and sees two pairs of glowing eyes staring at them.
HUNK says: ""Coran, what lives at the bottom of these mines?"
The Last Paladin.
On Arus, PIDGE forces entry into an elevator shaft with the drone ROVER.
PIDGE says: ""Hey, Rover."
ROVER follows PIDGE inside the shaft and hovers in place.
PIDGE says: ""Okay, Rover, here we go."
ROVER follows PIDGE down the shaft to the bottom. SENDAK and HAXUS are still in the Bridge.
SENDAK says: ""Run main cluster activation sequence."
HAXUS says: ""Activation sequence initiated."
HAXUS says: "Powering up for launch."
PIDGE reaches the Central Energy Chamber where the engine is.
PIDGE says: ""Okay, Allura, I'm near the turbine."
PIDGE says: "I think it's started."
ALLURA says: ""Then you'll have to hurry."
ALLURA says: "Cross the catwalk to the main column in the center."
PIDGE does as instructed.
PIDGE says: ""Okay."
ALLURA says: ""Now, open the hatch."
ALLURA says: "Find the central computer control hub and enter the following sequence..."
PIDGE says: ""Wait, wait, wait, wait!"
PIDGE says: "Which one is it?"
PIDGE says: "All the labels are in Altean!"
In the Castle's Bridge.
HAXUS says: ""Commander Sendak, we are ready for launch."
The launch starts and energy swells the chamber, disrupting the communication channel between ALLURA and PIDGE.
PIDGE says: ""I can't tell which one it is!"
PIDGE says: "Allura?"
PIDGE says: "Allura?"
PIDGE says: "Uh..."
Outside, ALLURA and KEITH witness the impending launch of the Castleship.
ALLURA says: ""I've lost connection with Pidge!"
ALLURA says: "Oh, no!"
ALLURA says: "It's taking off!"
PIDGE panics to find a solution.
PIDGE says: ""Uh..."
PIDGE says: "Uh..."
PIDGE says: "Whatever."
PIDGE slams the Green Bayard into the engine turbine, being thrown back, but successfully interrupting the launch.
HAXUS says: ""The main engine just shorted out!"
SENDAK pulls up a feed of the Central Energy Chamber and sees PIDGE fleeing.
SENDAK says: ""We have a saboteur."
SENDAK says: "Find him and take him out."
Episode ends.
