SAM says: ""Easy, son."
SAM says: "This ice is delicate."
MATT says: ""Amazing."
MATT says: "Isn't this exciting, Shiro?"
SHIRO says: ""You guys get a little more excited about ice samples than I do."
SAM says: ""This is history in the making."
SAM says: "Not only have we traveled farther than any human ever has, but this ice cold holy microscopic clues about the existence of life outside Earth."
MATT says: ""Think of it, Dad."
MATT says: "We could use those clues to become the first people to meet aliens."
SAM says: ""My life's work would be complete."
The area around them begins to rumble.
SAM says: ""What is that?"
SAM says: "Seismic activity?"
SHIRO says: ""We should get back to the ship."
A warship from the Galra Empire appears.
SAM says: ""Wha—"
SAM says: "?"
SAM says: "What is that?!"
SAM says: "!"
SAM says: "It can't be..."
SHIRO says: ""Run!"
SHIRO says: "Come on, run!"
SHIRO, MATTHEW HOLT, and SAMUEL HOLT try to run but are abducted and SHIRO awakens on the Galra warship to the voice of the UNNAMED GALRA COMMANDER speaking to ZARKON via video feed.
GALRA COMMANDER says: ""Emperor Zarkon, we were scouting system X-9-Y as ordered when we found these primitive scientists."
GALRA COMMANDER says: "I don't think they know anything useful."
ZARKON says: ""Take them back to the main fleet for interrogation."
ZARKON says: "The Druids will find out what they know."
SHIRO says: ""Please, we come from a peaceful planet!"
SHIRO says: "W-We mean you no harm!"
SHIRO says: "We're unarmed!"
SHIRO is knocked out and dragged along a corridor. He awakens and is shocked at what he sees.
An Unlikely Team.
The Three Cadets.
A year later, LANCE, HUNK, and PIDGE are on a simulated flight to Kerberos.
LANCE says: ""Galaxy Garrison flight log 5-11-14."
LANCE says: "Begin descent to Kerberos for rescue mission."
LANCE jerks the simulator while descending.
HUNK says: ""Augh."
HUNK says: "Lance, can you keep this thing straight?"
LANCE says: ""Relax, Hunk, I'm just getting a feel for the stick."
LANCE says: "I mean it's not like I did this!"
LANCE jerks the simulator; HUNK groans.
LANCE says: ""Or this!"
LANCE jerks the simulator again. HUNK feels ill.
HUNK says: ""Okay..."
HUNK says: "unless you want to wipe beef stroganoff out of all the little nooks and crannies in this thing, you'd better KNOCK IT OFF, MAN!"
PIDGE's monitor activates.
PIDGE says: ""We've picked up a distress beacon!"
LANCE says: ""All right, look alive, team!"
LANCE says: "Pidge, track coordinates."
PIDGE says: ""Copy."
The simulator starts to rumble and alarms blare.
HUNK says: ""Knock it off, Lance, please!"
LANCE says: ""Oh this one's on you, buddy."
LANCE says: "We've got a hydraulic stabilizer out."
HUNK pulls up a monitor.
HUNK says: ""Oh no—"
HUNK chokes down his vomit.
LANCE says: ""Oh, no—"
LANCE says: "Fix now, puke later!"
PIDGE says: ""I lost contact."
PIDGE says: "The shaking is interfering with our sensors."
LANCE says: ""Come on, Hunk!"
HUNK says: ""It's not responding."
HUNK says: "Ugh..."
HUNK unbuckles his seatbelt to fix the stabilizer. LANCE's monitor activates.
LANCE says: ""Oh, never mind, fellas."
LANCE says: "Thar she blows."
LANCE says: "Preparing for approach on visual."
PIDGE says: ""I don't think that's advisable with our current mechanical and..."
PIDGE says: "gastrointestinal issues."
HUNK is choking down vomit again.
HUNK says: ""Agreed."
LANCE says: ""Stop worrying."
LANCE says: "This baby can take it."
LANCE says: "Can't you, champ?"
LANCE pats the simulator but the simulator rumbles violently.
LANCE says: ""Uh, see?"
LANCE says: "She was—"
LANCE says: "she was nodding."
LANCE says: "She was nodding."
LANCE says: "Pidge, hail down to them and let them know their ride is here."
PIDGE unbuckles the seatbelt to reach the microphone.
PIDGE says: ""Attention lunar vessel—"
PIDGE says: "Uwah!!!"
PIDGE falls and collides with the floor.
LANCE says: ""What are you doing?"
LANCE says: "Buckle your belt."
LANCE says: "And Hunk, stop that shaking!"
HUNK says: ""I-I'm try—"
HUNK says: "ah-ah o-oh no—"
HUNK says: "!"
HUNK vomits in the main gearbox and the rumbling stops. PIDGE speaks into the microphone.
PIDGE says: ""Attention lunar vessel, this is Galaxy Garrison Rescue Craft One Victor Six Three Tango."
PIDGE says: "Coming in for landing and extraction, against crew recommendations."
LANCE says: ""Uh, no time for your mutinous comments now, Pidge."
LANCE says: "They're going under and we're going in."
LANCE dives the simulator towards the surface of Kerberos.
PIDGE says: ""Look out for that overhang!"
LANCE says: ""No worries!"
LANCE says: "My first year in flight school, you know what they called me?"
LANCE says: "They called me 'The Tailor' because of how I thread the needle."
LANCE says: "Come around, come around!"
LANCE says: "Come on, come on—"
LANCE says: "!"
The simulator strikes the overhang.
HUNK says: ""We lost a wing!"
LANCE says: ""Oh, man..."
The simulation flight crashes and the simulation ends.
COMPUTER says: ""Simulation Failed."
PIDGE says: ""Nice work, Tailor."
The simulator door opens and IVERSON appears.
IVERSON says: ""Roll out, donkeys!"
LANCE, HUNK, and PIDGE exit the simulator and stand before IVERSON and their class.
IVERSON says: ""Well let's see if we can't use this complete failure as a lesson for the rest of you students."
IVERSON says: "Can anyone point out the mistakes these three so-called cadets made in the simulator?"
STUDENT says: ""The engineer puked in the main gearbox!"
IVERSON says: ""Yes, as everyone knows, vomit is not an approved lubricant for engine systems."
IVERSON says: "What else?"
STUDENT says: ""The Comm Spec removed his safety harness."
STUDENT says: ""The pilot crashed!"
IVERSON says: ""Correct."
IVERSON says: "And worst of all, the whole jump, they're arguing with each other!"
IVERSON says: "Heck, if you're going to be this bad individually, you'd better at least be able to work as a team!"
IVERSON says: "Galaxy Garrison exists to turn young cadets like you into the next generation of elite astroexplorers, but these kind of mental mistakes are exactly what cost the lives of the men on the Kerberos Mission."
PIDGE says: ""That's not true, sir!"
IVERSON says: ""What did you say?!"
IVERSON says: "!"
LANCE clasps his hand over PIDGE'S mouth, but PIDGE continues; her voice muffled by the hand.
LANCE says: ""Sorry, sir!"
LANCE says: "I-I-I think he may have hit his head when he fell out of his chair."
LANCE says: "But point taken."
IVERSON says: ""I hope I don't need to remind you that the only reason your here is that the best pilot in your class had a discipline issue and flunked out."
IVERSON says: "Don't follow in his footsteps."
IVERSON says: "Next!"
LANCE, HUNK, and PIDGE dejectedly watch as their classmates board the simulator. Later, LANCE and HUNK hide in the halls of the Garrison as curfew begins.
IVERSON says: ""Lights out in five!"
IVERSON says: "Everyone back to their dorms, now."
HUNK says: ""We shouldn't be doing this."
LANCE says: ""You heard Commander Iverson."
LANCE says: "We need to bond as a team."
LANCE says: "We're going to grab Pidge, hit the town, loosen up, meet some nice girls, maybe—"
HUNK says: ""OK, I'm just—"
HUNK says: "I'm just saying this here, right now, on the record: This is a bad idea."
The lights turn off; LANCE and HUNK sneak through the hallways.
LANCE says: ""You know, for someone in a space exploration program, you don't have much of a sense of adventure."
HUNK says: ""All of your little 'adventures' end up with me in the principal's office."
LANCE sneaks by the Instructor's Lounge and motions for HUNK to follow, which he reluctantly does.
HUNK says: ""Oh, man..."
LANCE and HUNK hide in recycling cans as a guard passes by.
GUARD says: ""L-5 North all clear."
LANCE jumps out; HUNK tries to follow suit but gets stuck and falls over. HUNK stands.
HUNK says: ""I'm fine."
LANCE and HUNK hide as PIDGE leaves IVERSON's office. The two watch.
LANCE says: ""Where is he going?"
PIDGE is on the roof of the Galaxy Garrison, listening to radio chatter through headphones and special equipment. HUNK crawls along the roof and LANCE carefully removes the headphones to speak close to ear.
LANCE says: ""You come up here to rock out?"
PIDGE yells, startled.
PIDGE says: ""Agh!"
PIDGE says: "—"
PIDGE says: "Oh, Lance, Hunk."
PIDGE says: "No, um, just looking at stars."
LANCE says: ""Hey where'd you get this stuff?"
LANCE says: "It doesn't look like Garrison tech."
PIDGE says: ""I built it."
HUNK says: ""You built all this?"
HUNK tries to touch the equipment. PIDGE smacks his hand away.
PIDGE says: ""Stop it!"
PIDGE says: "With this thing, I can scan all the way to the edge of the solar system."
LANCE says: ""That Right?"
LANCE says: "All the way to Kerberos?"
PIDGE looks away but does not respond.
LANCE says: ""You go ballistic every time the instructors bring it up."
LANCE says: "What's your deal?"
HUNK tries to sneakily touch the equipment again.
PIDGE says: ""—"
PIDGE says: "Second warning, Hunk!"
HUNK stops.
HUNK says: ""Aw..."
LANCE says: ""Look, Pidge, if we're going to bond as a team, we can't have any secrets."
PIDGE says: ""Fine."
PIDGE says: "The world as you know it is about to change."
PIDGE says: "The Kerberos Mission wasn't lost because of some malfunction or crew mistake—"
PIDGE sees HUNK trying to touch the equipment again.
PIDGE says: ""—"
PIDGE says: "STOP TOUCHING MY EQUIPMENT!!!"
HUNK groans but finally desists.
PIDGE says: ""..."
PIDGE says: "So I've been scanning the system and picking up alien radio chatter."
HUNK says: ""Whoa, what?"
HUNK says: "Aliens?!"
HUNK says: "!"
LANCE says: ""OK, so you're insane."
LANCE says: "Got it."
PIDGE says: ""I'm serious!"
PIDGE says: "They keep repeating one word: "Voltron"."
PIDGE says: "And tonight, it's going crazier than I have ever heard it."
LANCE says: ""How crazy?"
The Galaxy Garrison building alarms blare. IVERSON speaks over the intercom.
IVERSON says: ""Attention, students."
IVERSON says: "This is not a drill."
IVERSON says: "We are on lockdown!"
IVERSON says: "Security situation Zulu Niner."
IVERSON says: "Repeat: All students are to remain in barracks until further notice."
A fiery object appears in the sky.
HUNK says: ""What's going on?"
HUNK says: "Is that a meteor?!"
HUNK says: "!"
HUNK says: "..."
HUNK says: "A very, very big..."
HUNK says: "meteor?"
PIDGE grabs binoculars.
PIDGE says: ""It's a ship!"
LANCE takes PIDGE'S binoculars and looks at the object.
LANCE says: ""Holy crow!"
LANCE says: "I can't believe what I'm seeing!"
LANCE says: "That's not one of ours!"
PIDGE says: ""No."
PIDGE says: "It's one of theirs."
HUNK says: ""So wait, there really are aliens out there?!"
HUNK says: "!"
The three watch as the alien spacecraft crashes into the desert. The Garrison sends out land rovers to the crash site.
PIDGE says: ""We've gotta see that ship!"
LANCE says: ""Hunk, come on!"
HUNK says: ""Oh, this is the worst team-building exercise ever."
LANCE, HUNK, and PIDGE run off to the crash site.
Rescuing Shiro.
LANCE, HUNK, and PIDGE spy on the quarantined crash site from a nearby cliff. LANCE views the alien craft through binoculars.
LANCE says: ""Whoa..."
LANCE says: "What the heck is that thing?!"
LANCE says: "!"
LANCE says: "..."
LANCE says: "And who the heck is she?"
PIDGE says: ""Lance!"
PIDGE hits LANCE for being distracted by a female Garrison officer.
LANCE says: ""Ow!"
LANCE says: "Ah, right, alien ship."
LANCE says: "Man, we'll never get past all those guards to get a look."
HUNK says: ""Aw, man."
HUNK says: "Yeah, we—"
HUNK says: "yeah I guess there's nothing to do but head back to the barracks, right?"
PIDGE says: ""Wait."
PIDGE says: "They set up a camera in there and I grabbed its feed."
PIDGE says: "Look!"
SHIRO is on the feed strapped to a table as Garrison technicians examine him.
SHIRO says: ""Hey!"
SHIRO says: "What are you doing?"
IVERSON says: ""Calm down, Shiro."
IVERSON says: "We just need to keep you quarantined until we run some tests on you."
SHIRO says: ""You have to listen to me!"
SHIRO says: "They destroyed worlds!"
SHIRO says: "Aliens are coming!"
LANCE says: ""That's Shiro!"
LANCE says: "The pilot of the Kerberos Mission."
LANCE says: "That guy's my hero!"
HUNK says: ""Guess he's not dead in space after all."
PIDGE says: ""Where's the rest of the crew?"
IVERSON says: ""Do you know how long you've been gone?"
SHIRO says: ""I don't know."
SHIRO says: "Months?"
SHIRO says: "Years?"
SHIRO says: "Look, there's no time."
SHIRO says: "Aliens are coming here for a weapon."
SHIRO says: "They're probably on their way."
SHIRO says: "They'll destroy us!"
SHIRO says: "We have to find Voltron!"
PIDGE says: ""Voltron!"
TECHNICIAN says: ""Sir, take a look at this."
TECHNICIAN says: "It appears his arm has been replaced with a cyborg prosthetic."
IVERSON says: ""Put him under until we know what that thing can do."
SHIRO says: ""Don't, don't be me under!"
SHIRO says: "No!"
SHIRO says: "No, there's no time!"
SHIRO says: "Let me go!"
PIDGE says: ""They didn't ask about the rest of the crew."
LANCE says: ""What are they doing?"
LANCE says: "The guy's a legend."
LANCE says: "They're not even gonna listen to him?"
PIDGE says: ""We have to get him out."
HUNK says: ""Ah, I hate to be the voice of reason here, always, but weren't we just watching on TV because there was no way to get past the guards?"
LANCE says: ""That was before we were properly motivated."
LANCE says: "We've just got to think."
LANCE says: "Could we tunnel in?"
PIDGE says: ""Maybe we could get some hazmat suits and sneak in like med techs."
HUNK says: ""Or we dress up like cooks, sneak into the commissary..."
HUNK says: "little late-night snack."
LANCE says: ""..."
LANCE says: "No."
LANCE says: "What we need is a distraction."
Explosions burst in the distance and the three cadets scream.
HUNK says: ""Is that the aliens?!"
HUNK says: "!"
HUNK says: "Are—"
HUNK says: "Tha—"
HUNK says: "The—"
HUNK says: "Is that the aliens?!"
HUNK says: "!"
HUNK says: "Are they here?!"
HUNK says: "!"
HUNK says: "They got here so quick!"
PIDGE says: ""No."
PIDGE says: "Those explosions were a distraction, for him!"
PIDGE points to KEITH arriving by hovercraft.
PIDGE says: ""The Garrison's headed towards the blast, and he's sneaking in from the other side!"
LANCE views the new arrival through binoculars.
LANCE says: ""No way..."
LANCE says: "!"
LANCE says: "Oh, he is not going to be us in there!"
LANCE says: "That guy is always trying to one-up me!"
HUNK says: ""Who is it?"
LANCE says: ""Keith!"
PIDGE says: ""Who?"
HUNK says: ""Are you sure?"
LANCE says: ""Oh, I'd recognize that mullet anywhere!"
PIDGE says: ""Who's Keith?!"
PIDGE says: "!"
LANCE, HUNK, and PIDGE run toward the quarantined crash site. Inside, the technicians examine SHIRO.
TECHNICIAN says: ""These readings are off the chart."
KEITH enters.
IVERSON says: ""Hey!"
KEITH attacks and knocks out all three technicians, then runs to SHIRO, surprised to find him.
KEITH says: ""Shiro..."
KEITH says: "?"
KEITH cuts SHIRO free from his bonds and tries to carry him out. LANCE, HUNK, and PIDGE arrive.
LANCE says: ""Nope."
LANCE says: "No you—"
LANCE says: "No, no, no, no, no, no, no you don't."
LANCE says: "I'm saving Shiro."
LANCE lifts SHIRO over his shoulder.
KEITH says: ""Who are you?"
LANCE says: ""Who am I?"
LANCE says: "Uh, the name's Lance."
KEITH silently looks at LANCE without recognition.
LANCE says: ""..."
LANCE says: "We were at the same class at the Garrison?"
KEITH says: ""Really?"
KEITH says: "Are you an engineer?"
LANCE says: ""No, I'm a pilot."
LANCE says: "We were, like, rivals."
LANCE says: "You know, Lance and Keith, neck-and-neck."
KEITH says: ""Oh wait, I remember you."
KEITH says: "You're a cargo pilot."
LANCE says: ""Well, not anymore."
LANCE says: "I'm fighter class now thanks to you washing out."
KEITH says: ""Well, congratulations."
LANCE and KEITH carry SHIRO out together. HUNK spots the Garrison returning.
HUNK says: ""Oh, man, they're coming back and they do not look happy."
HUNK says: "We gotta go."
HUNK says: "Uh, do you mind if we catch a ride with you?"
Everyone climbs aboard KEITH's hovercraft and it tips over.
PIDGE says: ""Is this thing going to be big enough for all of us?"
KEITH says: ""No."
KEITH has to take off as the Garrison arrives to pursue them. PIDGE has to hold on to SHIRO.
PIDGE says: ""Why am I holding this guy?"
HUNK says: ""Hey, we did all fit!"
LANCE says: ""Can't this thing go any faster?"
KEITH says: ""We could toss out some non-essential weight."
LANCE says: ""Oh, right!"
LANCE says: "..."
LANCE says: "..."
LANCE says: "..."
LANCE says: "OK, so that was an insult."
LANCE says: "I get it."
KEITH says: ""Big man, lean left!"
HUNK complies and the hovercraft turns, causing Garrison rovers to crash.
HUNK says: ""Aw man!"
HUNK says: "Mr."
HUNK says: "Harris just chiked out Professor Montgomery!"
HUNK says: "..."
HUNK says: "No, no, he's fine."
KEITH says: ""Big man, lean right!"
HUNK complies and the hovercraft jumps one cliff to the next, causing another rover to crash. HUNK spies the cliff's edge ahead of them.
HUNK says: ""Guys?"
HUNK says: "Is th-th-th-tha-tha—"
HUNK says: "Is that a cliff up ahead?"
LANCE says: ""Ooooh no, no, no!"
LANCE says: "No, no, no, no—"
LANCE says: "!"
KEITH says: ""Yup."
KEITH smirks and increases speed while everyone else screams. The hovercraft jumps off the cliff.
LANCE says: ""What are you doing?!"
LANCE says: "!"
LANCE says: "You're going to kill us all!"
KEITH says: ""Shut up and trust me!"
KEITH safely avoids crashing and continues flying into the desert, escaping the Garrison.
The Blue Lion.
Strange Energy.
SHIRO stands outside a desert shack at sunrise; KEITH approaches.
KEITH says: ""It's good to have you back."
SHIRO says: ""Heh."
SHIRO says: "It's good to be back."
KEITH says: ""So what happened out there?"
KEITH says: "Where..."
KEITH says: "were you?"
SHIRO says: ""I wish I could tell you."
SHIRO says: "My head's still pretty scrambled."
SHIRO says: "I was on an..."
SHIRO says: "alien ship but..."
SHIRO says: "somehow I escaped."
SHIRO says: "It's all a blur."
SHIRO says: "How did you know to come save me when I crashed?"
KEITH says: ""You should come see this."
SHIRO follows KEITH into the shack. Inside, KEITH shows SHIRO, LANCE, HUNK, and PIDGE his board of a map, diagrams, and notes.
SHIRO says: ""What have you been working on?"
KEITH says: ""I can't explain it, really."
KEITH says: "After getting booted from the Garrison, I was kinda..."
KEITH says: "lost and..."
KEITH says: "felt myself drawn out to this place."
KEITH says: "It's like something..."
KEITH says: "some energy, was telling me to search."
SHIRO says: ""For what?"
KEITH says: ""Well, I didn't really know at the time..."
KEITH says: "until I stumbled across this area."
KEITH says: "It's an outcropping of giant boulders with caves covered in these ancient markings."
KEITH says: "Each tells a slightly different story about a blue lion, but they all share clues leading to some event, some arrival happening last night."
KEITH says: "Then you showed up."
SHIRO says: ""..."
SHIRO says: "I should..."
SHIRO says: "thank you all for getting me out."
SHIRO says: "Lance, right?"
SHIRO offers LANCE his prosthetic hand. LANCE hesitates but shakes it. SHIRO offers to shake PIDGE and HUNK's hand. PIDGE is the only one who does.
PIDGE says: ""The nervous guy's Hunk."
PIDGE says: "I'm Pidge."
PIDGE says: "So, did anyone else from your crew make it out?"
SHIRO says: ""I'm not sure."
SHIRO says: "I remember the mission and being captured."
SHIRO says: "After that, it's just bits and pieces."
HUNK says: ""Yeah, sorry to interrupt, but back to the aliens."
HUNK says: "Where are they now?"
HUNK says: "Are they coming?"
HUNK says: "Are they coming for all of us?"
HUNK says: "Like where are they at this very moment?"
SHIRO says: ""I can't really put it together."
SHIRO says: "I-I remember the word "Voltron"."
SHIRO says: "It's some kind of weapon they're looking for, but I don't know why."
SHIRO says: "Whatever it is, I think we need to find it before they do."
HUNK says: ""Well last night, I was rummaging through Pidge's stuff, and I found this picture."
HUNK says: "Look it's his girlfriend."
HUNK shows everyone a picture of "PIDGE" and a girl. PIDGE steals the photo back.
PIDGE says: ""Hey, gimme that!"
PIDGE says: "What were you doing in my stuff?"
HUNK says: ""I wa—"
HUNK says: "I was looking for a candy bar."
HUNK says: "But then, I started reading his diary."
HUNK pulls out PIDGE's diary. PIDGE steals it back.
PIDGE says: ""WHAT?!"
PIDGE says: "!"
HUNK says: ""And I noticed that the repeating series of numbers the aliens are searching for looks a lot like a fraunhofer line."
KEITH says: ""Frown..."
KEITH says: "who?"
HUNK says: ""It's a number describing the emission spectrum of an element, only this element doesn't exist on Earth."
HUNK says: "I thought it might be this Voltron, and I think I can build a machine to look for it, kinda like a Voltron Geiger Counter."
LANCE says: ""Hunk, you big, gassy genius!"
HUNK says: ""It's pretty fascinating, really."
HUNK says: "Th-The wavelength looks like this."
HUNK pulls out a graph of the wavelength. KEITH grabs it from him.
KEITH says: ""Give me that."
KEITH matches the wavelength's appearance to an array of boulders he has seen and has a photo of.
Lions and Aliens.
The team arrives at the location with HUNK's new device.
LANCE says: ""..."
LANCE says: "OK."
LANCE says: "I admit it."
LANCE says: "This is super freaky."
HUNK says: ""I'm getting a reading."
HUNK uses the device to locate a cave with ancient carvings inside.
SHIRO says: ""What are these?"
KEITH says: ""These are the lion carvings I was telling you about."
KEITH says: "They're everywhere around here."
LANCE approaches a carving and touches it, causing all of theme to light up, surprising everyone.
LANCE says: ""Whoa..."
LANCE says: "Whoa!"
KEITH says: ""Heh, they've never done that before."
The ground beneath them collapses and the team falls into a cavern of water. LANCE is the first to look up and see the Blue Lion inside a force field.
LANCE says: ""They are everywhere."
PIDGE says: ""Is this it?"
PIDGE says: "Is this the Voltron?"
SHIRO says: ""It..."
SHIRO says: "must be."
KEITH says: ""This is what's been causing all this crazy energy out here."
KEITH approaches the Blue Lion, the rest of the team slowly follows.
KEITH says: ""Looks like there's a force field around it."
LANCE says: ""Does anyone else get the feeling this is staring at them?"
SHIRO says: ""Hmm..."
SHIRO says: "No."
LANCE says: ""Yeah."
LANCE says: "The eyes are totally following me."
KEITH runs up to the force field and touches it with no reaction.
KEITH says: ""I wonder how we get through this."
LANCE says: ""Maybe you just have to knock."
LANCE literally knocks on the force field and it reacts, dissipating and igniting the area around them in blue. The team sees an image of Voltron forming from the five Lions in their minds.
EVERYONE says: ""Woah..."
LANCE says: ""Uh, did everyone just see that?"
HUNK says: ""Voltron is a robot!"
HUNK says: "Voltron is a huge, huge, awesome robot!"
PIDGE says: ""And this thing is only one part of it!"
PIDGE says: "I wonder where the rest of them are."
SHIRO says: ""This is what they're looking for."
KEITH says: ""Incredible."
The Blue Lion suddenly lowers its head and opens its mouth to allow them inside, terrifying HUNK and PIDGE. LANCE hesitates, but gleefully enters and takes a seat in the cockpit.
LANCE says: ""Here we go."
The seat jolts forward, making LANCE scream, and the command console activates.
LANCE says: ""Heheh!"
LANCE says: "All right!"
LANCE says: "Very nice!"
HUNK says: ""OK guys, I-I feel the need to point out, just so that we're all, y'know, aware: We are in some kind of futuristic alien cat head right now."
LANCE senses the Blue Lion communicating with him.
LANCE says: ""Whoa, did you guys just hear that?"
KEITH says: ""Hear what?"
LANCE says: ""I-I think it's talking to me."
LANCE says: "Hmm..."
LANCE says: "Um..."
LANCE presses a few buttons; the Blue Lion stands up and roars. HUNK and PIDGE scream.
LANCE says: ""OK."
LANCE says: "Got it."
LANCE says: "Now let's try this."
LANCE smashes the Blue Lion out of the cavern and takes off flying, doing somersaults and wild turns in the air, terrifying the team. HUNK and PIDGE scream.
KEITH says: ""YOU ARE."
KEITH says: "THE WORST."
KEITH says: "PILOT."
KEITH says: "EVER."
LANCE joins in on the screaming. At the Galaxy Garrison, IVERSON and an guard witness the Blue Lion flying.
IVERSON says: ""What in the Sam Hill is that?"
GUARD says: ""It appears to be a flying blue lion, sir."
IVERSON is unimpressed; the Blue Lion lands and runs along the desert at high speed.
LANCE says: ""Isn't this awesome?!"
LANCE says: "!"
HUNK says: ""Make it stop!"
HUNK says: "Make it stop!"
LANCE says: ""I'm not making it do anything."
LANCE says: "It's like it's on autopilot!"
The Blue Lion takes off into the sky.
KEITH says: ""Where are you going?!"
KEITH says: "!"
LANCE says: ""I just said it's on autopilot!"
LANCE says: "It says there's an alien ship approaching Earth."
LANCE says: "I think we're supposed to stop it."
PIDGE says: ""What did it say, exactly?!"
PIDGE says: "!"
LANCE says: ""Well, it's not like it's saying words, more like feeding ideas into my brain."
LANCE says: "Kind of."
HUNK says: ""Well, if this thing is the weapon they're coming for, why don't we just, like—"
HUNK says: "I don't know, give it to them?"
HUNK says: "Maybe they'll leave us alone."
HUNK says: "Sorry, Lion, nothing personal."
SHIRO says: ""You don't understand."
SHIRO says: "These monsters spread like a plague throughout the galaxy, destroying everything in their path."
SHIRO says: "There's no bargaining with them."
SHIRO says: "They won't stop until everything is dead."
Everyone stares at HUNK.
HUNK says: ""..."
HUNK says: "Oh."
HUNK says: "Never mind then."
The Blue Lion leaves the Earth's atmosphere and a warship from the Galra Empire suddenly appears. Everyone gasps.
HUNK says: ""Uh..."
HUNK says: "Holy crow!"
HUNK says: "Is that really an alien ship?!"
HUNK says: "!"
SHIRO says: ""They found me..."
The Galra warship opens fire.
PIDGE says: ""We've got to get it out of here!"
LANCE says: ""Hang on!"
LANCE pilots to dodge the onslaught of laser guns.
LANCE says: ""Ah!"
LANCE says: "All right!"
LANCE says: "OK, I think I know what to do!"
PIDGE says: ""Be careful, man!"
PIDGE says: "This isn't a simulator!"
LANCE says: ""Well, that's good."
LANCE says: "I always wreck the simulator."
LANCE uses the Blue Lion's mouth cannon to blast the length of the warship.
LANCE says: ""Let's try this."
LANCE uses the Blue Lion's claws to tear into the warship's side.
SHIRO says: ""Nice job, Lance!"
LANCE says: ""OK, I think it's time to get these guys away from our planet."
Inside the warship, the UNNAMED GALRA COMMANDER that captured SHIRO a year previous speaks to ZARKON through a video transmission.
GALRA COMMANDER says: ""Lord Zarkon, the escaped prisoner and his people found the Lion."
GALRA COMMANDER says: "It attacked us and is heading out of the system."
ZARKON says: ""Follow that Lion and alert all ships in the area to intercept."
ZARKON says: "Capturing that Lion is your first and only priority."
GALRA COMMANDER says: ""Yes, your Majesty."
GALRA COMMANDER says: "Full power after the Lion!"
The Galra warship pursues the Blue Lion.
HUNK says: ""Oh, no!"
PIDGE says: ""They're gaining on us!"
LANCE says: ""It's weird."
LANCE says: "They're not trying to shoot us."
LANCE says: "Th-They're just chasing."
HUNK says: ""OK, seriously, now we think having aliens follow us is good?"
HUNK says: "I am not on board with this new direction, guys."
KEITH says: ""Where are we?"
SHIRO says: ""Edge of the solar system."
SHIRO says: "There's Kerberos."
PIDGE says: ""It takes months for our ships to get out this far."
PIDGE says: "We got out here in five seconds."
A Wormhole appears before them.
HUNK says: ""What is that?!"
HUNK says: "!"
LANCE says: ""Uh, this may seem crazy, but I think the Lion wants us to go through there."
PIDGE says: ""Where does it go?"
LANCE says: ""I-I don't know."
LANCE says: "Shiro, you're the senior officer here."
LANCE says: "What should we do?"
SHIRO says: ""Whatever's happening, the Lion knows more than we do."
SHIRO says: "I say we trust it, but we're a team now."
SHIRO says: "We should decide together."
The team looks at each other in silence.
LANCE says: ""..."
LANCE says: "All right."
LANCE says: "Guess we're all ditching class tomorrow."
The Blue Lion enters the Wormhole and it disappears before the Galra warship can follow.
The Sleeping Castle.
Princess Allura.
The team groans from the turbulence of the Wormhole and exit to a different part of the universe.
LANCE says: ""Whoa."
LANCE says: "That was..."
HUNK grunts and vomits in the Blue Lion, but pauses.
HUNK says: ""So sorry—"
HUNK continues to vomit.
PIDGE says: ""I'm just surprised it took this long."
SHIRO says: ""I don't recognize any of these constellations."
SHIRO says: "We must be a long, long way from Earth."
LANCE says: ""The Lion seems to want to go to this planet."
LANCE says: "I think..."
LANCE says: "I think it's going home."
As the Blue Lion blasts towards Arus, entering its atmosphere, the team huddles closer together from the intense turbulence.
LANCE says: ""Guys, personal space!"
LANCE says: "Hunk, your breath is killing me."
HUNK says: ""Um, is it just me or is anyone else having second thoughts about flying through a mysterious Wormhole?"
HUNK says: "Why are we listening to a robotic lion anyway?"
LANCE says: ""It got us away from that alien warship, didn't it?"
KEITH says: ""I don't know if you noticed, but we're in an alien warship."
LANCE says: ""Oh, are you scared?"
KEITH says: ""With you at the helm?"
KEITH says: "Terrified."
SHIRO says: ""All right, knock it off!"
SHIRO says: "No one's happy to be in this situation, but we're here now."
SHIRO says: "If we want to get through this, we've got to do it together."
PIDGE says: ""So, what do we do?"
Shiro says: ""First, we find out where we're headed."
Shiro says: "Lance?"
LANCE says: ""I don't know."
LANCE says: "I'm sorry."
LANCE says: "The Lion's not talking to me anymore."
LANCE says: "..."
LANCE says: "Wait!"
LANCE says: "Wait, wait, wait!"
LANCE says: "Shh!"
LANCE says: "Listen."
LANCE says: "I think I hear something."
A high-pitched squeal sounds.
KEITH says: ""I'm hearing it, too."
HUNK says: ""It's, uh—"
HUNK says: "It's kind of a—"
HUNK says: "a high-pitched squeal?"
LANCE farts; the team holds their noses in disgust.
SHIRO says: ""Come on, Lance!"
KEITH says: ""Come on, Lance!"
HUNK says: ""Come on, Lance!"
LANCE says: ""But seriously, there's a Castle up ahead."
Everyone's amazed as the Blue Lion approaches the Castle of Lions and the latent Castleship reactivates. The Lion lands in the courtyard.
KEITH says: ""Wow."
SHIRO says: ""Keep your guard up."
PIDGE says: ""Something wrong?"
SHIRO says: ""My crew was captured by aliens once."
SHIRO says: "I'm not going to let it happen again."
After the team exits the Blue Lion, it stands up, startling everyone.
HUNK says: ""Oh no!"
HUNK says: "Oh no!"
HUNK says: "I knew it was going to eat us!"
HUNK says: "No!"
The Blue Lion roars, opening the Castleship's doors. HUNK cowers behind SHIRO until the doors finish opening.
HUNK says: ""Oh, the door is open."
HUNK says: "Guess I was wrong about you."
The eerie silence bemuses the team as they enter the vestibule.
HUNK says: ""Hellooo?"
HUNK's voice echos in the emptiness while everyone stares at him, startled. HUNK shrugs.
PIDGE says: ""From the size of the Lion, I expected these steps to be bigger."
A beam of light appears as the vestibule activates. Everyone gasps.
COMPUTER says: ""Hold for identity scan."
PIDGE says: ""What?"
SHIRO says: ""Why are we here?"
SHIRO says: "What do you want with us?"
LANCE says: ""Whoa!"
PIDGE says: ""Whoa!"
Crystal torches light up a path.
PIDGE says: ""I guess we're going that way."
As the team goes forward, more crystal torches ignite to lead them deeper inside. HUNK's voice echoes as he calls out.
HUNK says: ""Hello?"
HUNK says: "..."
HUNK says: "Hellooo?"
The team arrives at the Sleep Chamber of the Castleship.
HUNK says: ""Hello?"
LANCE says: ""Where are we?"
PIDGE says: ""It's some kind of control room."
The console PIDGE is looking at suddenly activates and two sleep pods rise from the floor.
HUNK says: ""Are these guys..."
HUNK says: "dead?"
One of the sleep pods opens, revealing ALLURA as she instantly awakens.
ALLURA says: ""Father!"
LANCE immediately catches the ALLURA in his arms. He blushes at the sight of her and dons a suave persona.
LANCE says: ""Hello."
ALLURA says: ""Who are you?"
ALLURA says: "Where am I?"
LANCE says: ""I'm Lance."
LANCE says: "And you're right here in my arms."
ALLURA says: ""Your..."
ALLURA says: "ears."
LANCE says: ""..."
LANCE says: "Yeah?"
ALLURA says: ""They're hideous."
ALLURA says: "What's wrong with them?"
LANCE says: ""Nothing's wrong with them!"
LANCE says: "They heard exactly what you said about them!"
ALLURA grabs LANCE by the ears and puts him in a restraining hold.
ALLURA says: ""Who are you?"
ALLURA says: "Where is King Alfor?"
ALLURA says: "What are you doing in my Castle?"
LANCE says: ""A giant blue lion brought us here!"
LANCE says: "That's all we know!"
ALLURA says: ""How do you have the Blue Lion?"
ALLURA says: "What happened to its Paladin?"
ALLURA says: "What are you all doing here?"
ALLURA says: "Unless..."
ALLURA says: "How long has it been?"
SHIRO says: ""We don't know what you're talking about."
SHIRO says: "Why don't you tell us who you are?"
SHIRO says: "Maybe we can help."
ALLURA says: ""I am Princess Allura of Planet Altea."
ALLURA says: "I've got to find out where we are and how long we've been asleep."
ALLURA accesses the console by placing her hands on it; a screen appears.
PIDGE says: ""Okay, that's how that works."
The second sleep pod opens, revealing CORAN. He gasps at the sight of LANCE.
CORAN says: ""E-Enemy combatants!"
CORAN jumps towards LANCE but LANCE side-steps him, so CORAN loses his balance.
CORAN says: ""Quiznak!"
CORAN says: "You're lucky I have a case of the old "Sleep Chamber Knees"."
CORAN says: "Otherwise, I'd grab your head like this, wrap you up like so and—"
CORAN says: "One, two, three—"
CORAN imitates his fighting moves and snaps his fingers.
CORAN says: ""—"
CORAN says: "Sleepy time!"
LANCE says: ""Well, before you did that, I'd—"
LANCE says: "Hoo!"
LANCE says: "Ha!"
LANCE says: "Hiyah!"
LANCE imitates rudimentary karate.
LANCE says: ""—"
LANCE says: "Like that."
CORAN says: ""Oh, Really?!"
CORAN says: "!"
CORAN says: "Well how could you do that when I've already come at you with this?!"
CORAN says: "!"
CORAN bends down and pretends to strike repeatedly.
CORAN says: ""Ha, ha, ha, ha-ey!"
HUNK says: ""Man, these guys are good."
ALLURA says: ""It can't be..."
CORAN says: ""What is it?"
ALLURA says: ""We've been asleep for 10,000 years!"
ALLURA recalls her last memory of being awake. She stood in the Bridge of the Castle of Lions with CORAN and her father, KING ALFOR. The Castleship was under attack by ZARKON's fleet. ZARKON appeared on screen.
ALFOR says: ""Zarkon!"
ZARKON says: ""Your fleet has been destroyed, Alfor."
ZARKON says: "I will be there shortly to claim Voltron."
ZARKON ended the transmission; a Galra warship blasted the Castleship with a powerful cannon.
ALLURA says: ""Father, we must form Voltron and fight before it's too late!"
ALFOR says: ""It's already too late."
ALFOR says: "We must send the Lions away."
ALFOR says: "We can't risk them falling into Zarkon's hands."
ALLURA says: ""We can't give up hope!"
ALFOR says: ""I'm sorry, daughter."
ALFOR says: "If all goes well, I will see you again soon."
KING ALFOR used a mysterious light to put ALLURA asleep.
ALLURA says: ""Father..."
ALLURA says: "!"
ALFOR says: ""I love you."
ALLURA's memories end; the scene returns to the present.
Allura says: ""Planet Altea and all of the planets in our solar system have been destroyed."
Allura says: "Coran, Father is gone."
Allura says: "Our entire civilization..."
ALLURA becomes enraged.
Allura says: "Zarkon!"
SHIRO recalls ZARKON's face.
SHIRO says: ""Zarkon..."
SHIRO says: "?"
ALLURA says: ""He was the King of the Galra."
ALLURA says: "A vile creature and enemy to all free people."
SHIRO says: ""I remember now..."
SHIRO says: "I was his prisoner."
ALLURA says: ""He's still alive?"
ALLURA says: "Impossible!"
SHIRO says: ""I can't explain it, but it's true."
SHIRO says: "He's searching for a super weapon called Voltron."
ALLURA says: ""He's searching for it because he knows it's the only thing that can defeat him, and that's exactly why we must find it before he does."
The Galra Empire.
At ZARKON's Central Command, HAGGAR is surrounded by glowing purple crystals and scrying for information on a magic circle. Suddenly sensing something, HAGGAR goes to inform ZARKON.
HAGGAR says: ""The Blue Lion has returned, and now I feel a resurgence of Altean energy."
ZARKON says: ""Alfor's daughter lives?"
ZARKON says: "How?"
HAGGAR says: ""I know not, but it is time to reclaim what is rightfully ours."
ZARKON says: ""Yes."
ZARKON says: "I shall wipe that foul race from the universe forever and take back Voltron."
ZARKON says: "Contact my commanders."
On a Galra warship, SENDAK is charging his prosthetic arm.
HAXUS says: ""Emperor Zarkon requests an audience."
SENDAK recieves ZARKON's video transmission at the warship's Bridge.
ZARKON says: ""Commander Sendak, the Princess of Altea is alive and hiding in your sector."
ZARKON says: "We believe she alone holds the whereabouts of the remaining Lions."
ZARKON says: "Your battle fleet is the closest to her location."
ZARKON says: "Retrieve her and the Lions."
ZARKON says: "With them all, the Galra Empire will be unstoppable."
SENDAK says: ""I fight for the Empire."
SENDAK says: "I conquer in the name of Galra."
SENDAK says: "No foe has ever stood in my way and none ever will."
SENDAK says: "Vrepit sa!"
ZARKON ends the transmission.
SENDAK says: ""Set a course for Arus."
The Five Lions.
On the Castleship, ALLURA stands at the Sleep Chamber console with a plate of food goo floating nearby.
CORAN says: "" Princess, you must eat."
CORAN says: "It's been 10,000 years!"
ALLURA says: ""I'm not hungry."
LANCE says: ""Man, 10,000 years?"
LANCE says: "That's like one thousand plus ten."
KEITH says: ""That's times ten."
LANCE says: ""Whatever, dropout."
HUNK says: ""I haven't eaten since breakfast and I'm starving."
PIDGE says: ""Yeah, but you've thrown up, like, five times."
HUNK says: ""Hmm..."
HUNK says: "Good point."
HUNK begins eating the food goo, continuing to eat although disgusted.
SHIRO says: ""I can't believe your civilization created such advanced technology 10,000 years ago."
SHIRO says: "It must have been an incredible place."
CORAN says: ""Yes, it was..."
CORAN says: "but now it is gone and we're the last Alteans alive."
ALLURA mourns as CORAN comforts her; she hears a squeak from her sleep pod and and is happy to find the four Altean Mice.
ALLURA says: ""Looks like we're not the last, after all."
The Castleship alarms blare. and a Galra warship appears on-screen.
CORAN says: ""A Galra battleship has set its tracker to us!"
ALLURA says: ""How did they find us?!"
ALLURA says: "!"
LANCE says: ""I'm not sure, but I bet it's Keith's fault."
KEITH says: ""Say whatever you've got to say to make yourself feel better..."
KEITH says: "after getting us stuck on the other side of a Wormhole!"
LANCE says: ""I'LL STICK YOU IN A WORMHOLE!"
LANCE and KEITH appear ready to fight, but SHIRO separates them.
SHIRO says: ""Stow it, cadets!"
SHIRO says: "This is no time to place blame, it's time to work as a team."
SHIRO says: "How long before they arrive?"
CORAN says: ""At their speed?"
CORAN says: "Oh, well, uh, carry the two..."
CORAN says: "I'd say probably a couple of days?"
ALLURA says: ""Good."
ALLURA says: "Let them come!"
ALLURA says: "By the time they get here, you five will have reformed Voltron, and together, we will destroy Zarkon's empire!"
HUNK burps.
HUNK says: ""Sorry!"
HUNK says: "Food goo."
SHIRO says: ""Princess, there are five of these Lions."
SHIRO says: "How are we going to find the rest?"
In the Castleship's Bridge with a Crystal above, ALLURA stands in the center.
CORAN says: ""King Alfor connected the Lions to Allura's life force."
CORAN says: "She alone is the key to the Lions' whereabouts."
ALLURA activates the computer, opening up a map of the entire universe.
ALL says: ""Whoa!"
PIDGE says: ""These are..."
PIDGE says: "coordinates."
PIDGE says: "The Black Lion looks like it's in the same location as the Blue Lion."
CORAN says: ""Look at your primitive synapses firing away in their little brain cage!"
ALLURA says: ""Very observant."
ALLURA says: "That's because the Black Lion is in the Castle."
CORAN says: ""To keep the Black Lion out of Zarkon's hands, King Alfor locked it in the Castle."
CORAN says: "It can only be freed if the other four Lions are present."
ALLURA says: ""As you have found, the Lions choose their pilots."
ALLURA says: "It is a mystical bond and cannot be forced."
ALLURA says: "The Quintessence of the pilot is mirrored in his Lion."
ALLURA says: "Together, they form something greater than science can explain."
ALLURA sends the Black Lion hologram towards SHIRO.
ALLURA says: ""The Black Lion is the decisive head of Voltron."
ALLURA says: "It will take a pilot who is a born leader and in control at all times, someone whose men will follow without hesitation."
ALLURA says: "That is why, Shiro, you will pilot the Black Lion."
ALLURA moves the Green Lion's hologram towards PIDGE.
ALLURA says: ""The Green Lion has an inquisitive personality and needs a pilot of intellect and daring."
ALLURA says: "Pidge, you will pilot the Green Lion."
ALLURA says: "The Blue Lion—"
LANCE says: ""—"
LANCE says: "Whope, hold up, let me guess: Takes the most handsome slash best pilot of the bunch?"
LANCE smiles; ALLURA looks annoyed and then continues.
ALLURA says: ""The..."
ALLURA says: "Yellow Lion is caring and kind."
ALLURA sends the hologram Yellow Lion towards HUNK.
ALLURA says: ""Its pilot is one who puts the needs of others above his own."
ALLURA says: "His heart must be mighty."
ALLURA says: "As the leg of Voltron, you will lift the team up and hold them together."
HUNK questionably points to himself.
ALLURA says: ""The Red Lion is temperamental and the most difficult to master."
ALLURA says: "It's faster and more agile than the others, but also more unstable."
ALLURA says: "Its pilot needs to be someone who relies more on instincts than skill alone."
ALLURA says: "Keith, you will fly the Red Lion."
LANCE says: ""What?"
LANCE says: "This guy?"
LANCE and KEITH glare at each other.
ALLURA says: ""Unfortunately, I cannot locate the Red Lion's coordinates yet."
ALLURA says: "There must be something wrong with the Castle."
ALLURA says: "After 10,000 years, it..."
ALLURA says: "might need some work."
CORAN says: ""Don't worry, we'll find it soon."
CORAN says: "They don't call me "The Coranic" for nothing."
CORAN says: "It's because it sounds like "mechanic."
CORAN says: "" So..."
CORAN says: "Coranic, mechanic."
CORAN says: "It's not—"
CORAN says: "It doesn't sound..."
CORAN says: "exactly like it."
CORAN says: "It's similar."
The hologram Lions roar and charge together, forming Voltron.
ALLURA says: ""Once all the Lions are united, you will form Voltron, the most powerful warrior ever known, the Defender of the Universe."
HUNK says: ""Awesome!"
PIDGE says: ""Oh..."
HUNK says: ""Wait."
HUNK says: "Okay, we're going to be in there and flying Lions."
HUNK says: "Got that part."
HUNK says: "How do Lions turn into legs?"
HUNK says: "Also, is this going to be a long trip?"
HUNK says: "Because I have to pee."
HUNK says: "Do you people pee?"
SHIRO says: ""You know we don't have much time."
SHIRO says: "Pidge and I will go after the Green Lion."
SHIRO says: "Lance, you take Hunk and get the yellow one."
SHIRO says: "Keith, you stay here."
SHIRO says: "If you locate that Red Lion, go get it."
ALLURA says: ""In the meantime, I'll get this Castle's defenses ready."
ALLURA says: "They'll be sorely needed."
CORAN says: ""I'll ready a pod a-and load in the coordinates so that you can reach the Green Lion."
The two teams take off, LANCE with HUNK in the Blue Lion, and SHIRO and PIDGE in a flight pod; ALLURA readies herself to open a Wormhole with the Castleship's power.
CORAN says: ""We can only keep the Wormholes that lead to the other Lions open for two of your Earth hours, so you'll have to be quick about your work."
CORAN says: "The good news is that according to my readings, both planets are relatively peaceful."
CORAN says: "So, if you do get stuck, they could be relaxing places to live out the rest of your lives."
CORAN says: "Enjoy the trip!"
PIDGE says: ""Wait—"
LANCE says: ""Wait!"
LANCE says: "What?"
LANCE says: "No!"
LANCE says: "OK—"
LANCE says: "!"
HUNK says: ""I did not receive the memo on this."
Retrieving The Lions.
Green and Yellow.
SHIRO and PIDGE arrive at the densely-forested Green Planet and explore it using an Altean compass.
PIDGE says: ""Look!"
PIDGE points towards a canoe with a lion carved as its bowsprit. A sloth-like alien suddenly appears beside them and startles them; SHIRO and PIDGE yell.
PIDGE says: ""It's just a..."
PIDGE says: "whatever..."
PIDGE says: "that thing is."
The sloth-like alien recognizes the Voltron symbol on PIDGE's compass.
PIDGE says: ""I..."
PIDGE says: "I think he wants us to get in his canoe."
SHIRO says: ""Then I guess we should go."
PIDGE says: ""Huh?"
SHIRO says: ""I've been locked up by aliens for a year."
SHIRO says: "This is nothing."
SHIRO and PIDGE peacefully ride the canoe as the sloth-like alien paddles them towards the Green Lion, squeaks are heard from the inhabitants of the forest.
PIDGE says: ""I wonder if Hunk and Lance are having as good a time as us."
Meanwhile, LANCE and HUNK are being chased by Galra fighter jets and coming under heavy fire. Both of them scream for dear life among the blaring alarms.
HUNK says: ""Oh, no!"
LANCE says: ""Oh, no!"
HUNK says: "No, no, no!"
LANCE says: "No, no, no!"
HUNK says: "Oh!"
LANCE says: "Oh!"
HUNK says: "Oh, no!"
LANCE says: "Oh, no!"
The Galra figher jets hit the Blue Lion with missiles, knocking it out of the sky.
HUNK says: ""I thought Coran said these planets were peaceful!"
LANCE says: ""Maybe "peaceful" means something else in Altean!"
LANCE prevents the Blue Lion from crashing and flies towards a Galra mine. HUNK pulls up an Altean compass.
HUNK says: ""According to the coordinates, we're right on top of the Yellow Lion."
HUNK says: "It's below there, where they're mining for the ore."
HUNK says: "They don't even know the Lion is there."
HUNK says: "Or maybe they just got here and they're digging for the Lion?"
HUNK says: "What do you think, Lance?"
LANCE says: ""Who cares?"
LANCE says: "Just go get it!"
LANCE says: "I'm dropping you down there."
HUNK says: ""Me?"
HUNK says: "Down there?"
HUNK says: "No."
HUNK says: "No, no, no."
LANCE says: ""Yes, I'll cover you!"
LANCE dives the Blue Lion to the surface and runs it toward the mine under laser fire.
HUNK says: ""No, what if the Yellow Lion doesn't work?"
HUNK says: "Wh-What if I—"
HUNK says: "What if I can't get in the mine?"
HUNK says: "What if I start crying?"
HUNK says: "It's too late!"
HUNK says: "I'm already crying!"
LANCE says: ""Sorry, no time for questions."
LANCE quickly ejects HUNK and he rolls towards the mine while LANCE draws the heavy laser fire away from him. HUNK opens a mine lift's controls and starts hot-wiring them.
HUNK says: ""Oh Yeah, sure, just drop me off in an alien planet."
HUNK says: "That's cool, man."
HUNK says: "It's only occupied by mean purple aliens that want to kill me, but whatever."
HUNK says: "Just ignore them and go connect with a big, yellow, mechanical cat."
HUNK says: "Easy-peasy."
HUNK says: "Yeah."
HUNK says: "That all makes a ton of sense to me."
The Galra lift goes down into them mine.
HUNK says: ""Cool..."
HUNK says: "!"
HUNK says: "Okay, I'm in a giant hole."
HUNK says: "Now what, Hunk?"
Hunks gets closer to the Yellow Lion, causing the carvings around him to glow and show a path.
HUNK says: ""..."
HUNK says: "Ooh."
HUNK says: "Pretty."
A massive glowing circle appears in front of him.
HUNK says: ""How am I..."
HUNK says: "going to get through that?"
HUNK notices a mobile drill.
HUNK says: "Hmm?"
HUNK says: "Hmm..."
LANCE struggles while he flies the Blue Lion into the sky to draw the attacks. HUNK finds the Yellow Lion after drilling through the cave wall around it. LANCE battles the Galra, but they start firing at the mine entrance.
LANCE says: ""Oh, no!"
The Galra fighter jets cause a massive explosion.
LANCE says: ""HUNK!"
SHIRO and PIDGE are still riding along peacefully in the canoe, but PIDGE begins to have doubts.
PIDGE says: ""I know the Princess said that this is supposed to be my Lion, but what if she's wrong?"
PIDGE says: "I mean, she's probably not wrong."
PIDGE says: "She's a princess, but I'm not a pilot, even though..."
PIDGE says: "I've always wanted to be a pilot."
PIDGE says: "I mean, I read all the fighter manuals, but never got to fly the simulator."
PIDGE says: "But, hey, I can't be all that worse than Lance."
PIDGE says: "He crashed all the time."
PIDGE says: "But what if I get in there and it doesn't respond?"
PIDGE says: "What if I get in there and it's too big and my feet don't touch the pedals?"
PIDGE says: "What if there aren't even pedals?!"
PIDGE says: "!"
SHIRO says: ""You're rambling."
SHIRO says: "Listen..."
SHIRO says: "Our commander on the Kerberos Mission is the smartest man I ever met, and he always said, 'If you get too worried about what could go wrong, you might miss a chance to do something great."
PIDGE smiles fondly. The canoe stops at a root-covered stone temple and SHIRO and PIDGE approach the steps; the lion carvings glow from PIDGE's presence.
SHIRO says: ""Go."
SHIRO says: "Be great."
PIDGE grins and runs towards the temple's summit. Although nothing is found at the top, a growl is heard and light glows beneath PIDGE. PIDGE jumps inside of the temple.
PIDGE says: ""Whoo-hoo-hoo!"
The Green Lion finally breaks free from its tomb. LANCE is fighting the Galra fighter jets on the planetoid.
LANCE says: ""Hunk, come on!"
LANCE says: "Please, buddy!"
The Galra fighter jets hit the Blue Lion with a bombardment of laser fire and send it into a spin.
LANCE says: ""Oh, no, no, no, no, no!"
LANCE says: "Going down!"
LANCE says: "We're going down!"
The Blue Lion crash lands and struggles to stand. As the Galra fighter jets lock on and fire their missiles, LANCE braces for impact.
LANCE says: ""Oh, no!"
Suddenly, the Yellow Lion appears, blocking the incoming missiles and flattening the figher jets with its own body.
HUNK says: ""You okay, Lance?"
LANCE says: ""Hunk!"
LANCE says: "I thought you were dead!"
LANCE says: "You jumped in front of those shots to save my life!"
HUNK says: ""Well, actually, I was trying to get out of the way."
HUNK says: "Thankfully, what this thing lacks in speed, it more than makes up for in armor."
HUNK says: "Man, can it take a beating!"
HUNK says: "Ooh?"
Galra fighter jets fire more lasers; the Yellow Lion provides cover.
HUNK says: ""We've got incoming!"
ALLURA appears on the command screen of the Blue Lion.
ALLURA says: ""Paladins, please hurry back!"
ALLURA says: "I can't hold the Wormhole much longer!"
LANCE says: ""Let's get out of here!"
The two Lions fly towards the Wormhole, although the Yellow Lion starts twirling towards it after getting hit by one of the Galra fighter jets. HUNK feels ill.
HUNK says: ""Ah—"
HUNK says: "!"
HUNK says: "Not this again..."
HUNK says: "!"
HUNK says: "Oh..."
LANCE says: ""Quit screwing around, Hunk!"
LANCE says: "The Wormhole is closing!"
HUNK and LANCE safely reach the Wormhole.
King Alfor.
LANCE and HUNK groand as they enter the Bridge of the Castle of Lions where everyone waits.
ALLURA says: ""You made it."
LANCE says: ""Yeah, just barely."
LANCE says: "That was a nightmare."
LANCE says: "I almost puked out there."
LANCE says: "I felt like Hunk!"
HUNK says: ""Think how I felt."
HUNK says: "I am Hunk."
PIDGE says: ""Yeah..."
PIDGE says: "We had a tough time, too."
SHIRO and PIDGE smile at each other.
SHIRO says: ""Did we find the Red Lion yet?"
CORAN says: ""Allura just located it."
CORAN says: "There's a bit of good news and bad news."
CORAN says: "The good news is, the Red Lion's nearby."
CORAN says: "The bad news is, it's on board that Galra ship now orbiting Arus."
CORAN says: "But wait, good news again."
CORAN says: "We're Arus!"
SHIRO says: ""They're here already?"
CORAN says: ""Yes."
CORAN says: "Guess my calculations were a bit off."
CORAN says: "Finger counting—"
CORAN says: "I-It's more of an art than a science."
CORAN says: "Hmm?"
A video transmission overtakes the Castle's screen, and SENDAK appears.
SENDAK says: ""Princess Allura, this is Commander Sendak of the Galra Empire."
SENDAK says: "I come on behalf of Emperor Zarkon, Lord of the Known Universe."
SENDAK says: "I am here to confiscate the Lions."
SENDAK says: "Turn them over to me, or I will destroy your planet."
The transmission ends.
SHIRO says: ""All right, let's not panic."
HUNK says: ""Not panic?"
HUNK says: "Th-The scary purple alien thing is driving his battleship toward us."
HUNK says: "We only have four Lions."
PIDGE says: ""Technically, only three working Lions."
HUNK says: ""That's right."
HUNK says: "Thank you, Pidge."
HUNK says: "Three working Lions an-and a Castle that's, like, 10,000 years old."
CORAN says: ""A-Actually, it's 10,600 years old."
CORAN says: "You see, it was built by my grandfather—"
HUNK says: ""Thanks, Coran."
HUNK says: "Thank you for that."
HUNK says: "See?"
HUNK says: "Now is the perfect time to panic!"
ALLURA says: ""Wait!"
ALLURA says: "This Castle has a particle barrier we can activate."
LANCE says: ""Girl, you've already activated my par—"
SHIRO says: ""—"
SHIRO says: "Lance!"
CORAN says: ""The particle barrier won't hold Sendak's ion cannon forever."
CORAN says: "The Galra technology must have advanced since we fought them last."
HUNK says: ""Panic now?"
SHIRO says: ""No."
SHIRO says: "We've just got to figure out our plan of action, aaand..."
SHIRO says: "figure it out quickly."
LANCE says: ""I say we pop through a Wormhole and live to fight another day."
HUNK says: ""I second that."
HUNK says: "Yes."
HUNK says: "I mean, we tried to find all the Lions, right?"
HUNK says: "We gave it the old college try."
HUNK says: "Couldn't do it."
HUNK says: "We only have three."
HUNK says: "We can't form Voltron."
HUNK says: "I man, I guess we could form a..."
HUNK says: "snake?"
HUNK says: "Or a worm!"
HUNK says: "To go through that hole, Lance, that you were talking about."
LANCE says: ""Then, it's settled."
LANCE says: "Allura, you ride with me."
LANCE says: "One of you take the old guy."
CORAN seethes.
PIDGE says: ""We can't just abandon Arus."
PIDGE says: "The Galra will keep destroying planets and capturing prisoners until we stop them."
HUNK says: ""Okay."
HUNK says: "If we run, then maybe Sendak will follow us and leave this planet alone, like when we left Earth."
HUNK says: "We form the snake-worm thingamajig and we—"
HUNK says: "hisss out of here."
KEITH says: ""Sendak could destroy the planet then come after us anyway."
KEITH says: "Staying is our only option."
LANCE says: ""Here's an option: shut your Quiznak."
KEITH says: ""I don't think you're using that word correctly."
LANCE says: ""What do you know, Mullet?"
KEITH says: ""We're staying."
LANCE says: ""Leaving!"
PIDGE says: ""Staying!"
HUNK says: ""Snake!"
SHIRO says: ""Guys, stop!"
SHIRO says: "Princess Allura, these are your Lions."
SHIRO says: "You've dealt with the Galra Empire before."
SHIRO says: "You know what we're facing better than any of us."
SHIRO says: "What do you think is the best course of action?"
ALLURA says: ""I..."
ALLURA says: "I-I don't know."
CORAN says: ""Perhaps your father can help."
ALLURA says: ""My father?"
CORAN takes ALLURA to the Castle's Memory Chamber.
ALLURA says: ""Coran, what is this?"
CORAN says: ""King Alfor knew there was a chance he might never see you again."
CORAN says: "So, his memories, his very being, were stored in this computer for you."
ALLURA approaches the computer and a burst of light changes the Chamber to a vision of Altea. A holographic image of King ALFOR appears from the computer.
ALLURA says: ""Father!"
ALLURA says: "Father, it is so good to see you."
ALFOR says: ""Allura, my only child, how I've missed your face."
ALLURA says: ""..."
ALLURA says: "I'm so frightened."
ALLURA says: "A Galra ship is set to attack, and I don't know what to do."
ALLURA says: "Please, Father, I need your help."
ALFOR says: ""I would do anything to take this burden from you."
ALLURA says: ""I don't know if we should run to preserve what we have or stay and risk everything."
ALLURA says: "I want to fight, but the Paladins of old are gone."
ALLURA says: "I know what you would do."
ALFOR says: ""I scattered the Lions of Voltron to keep them out of Zarkon's hands."
ALFOR says: "You urged me to keep them and fight, but, for the greater good of protecting the universe, I chose to hide them."
ALLURA says: ""I think I understand."
ALFOR says: ""No, daughter, you were right."
ALFOR says: "I made a terrible mistake, one that cost the universe countless lives."
ALFOR says: "Forming Voltron is the only way to stop Zarkon."
ALFOR says: "You must be willing to sacrifice everything to assemble the Lions and correct my error."
ALLURA dons a space suit and returns to the Paladins in the Command Room.
ALLURA says: ""You five Paladins were brought here for a reason."
ALLURA says: "The Voltron Lions are meant to be piloted by you and you alone."
ALLURA says: "We must fight and keep fighting until we defeat Zarkon."
ALLURA says: "It is our destiny."
ALLURA says: "Voltron is the universe's only hope."
ALLURA says: "We are the universe's only hope."
SHIRO says: ""We're with you, Princess."
ALLURA brings the Paladins to the armory holding the Paladin armor. Everyone is hyped.
ALLURA says: ""Your suits of armor."
LANCE says: ""Cool!"
SHIRO says: ""Outstanding."
KEITH says: ""Nice."
PIDGE says: ""Oh, neat!"
HUNK starts comparing his body with that of his suit, doubting he will fit.
HUNK says: ""Hmm..."
HUNK says: "Mmm..."
HUNK says: "hmm."
CORAN says: ""Princess, are you sure about this?"
CORAN says: "They aren't exactly the best and brightest the universe has to offer."
ALLURA says: ""No, but they're all we've got."
SHIRO says: ""Boys, it's time to suit up!"
The new Paladins don their armor.
ALLURA says: ""The Bayard is the traditional weapon of the Paladins of Voltron."
ALLURA says: "It takes a distinct shape for each Paladin."
The Paladins recieve their Bayards. PIDGE's becomes a small grappling hook with a knife head.
LANCE says: ""Aw, you got a cute little bayard."
PIDGE strikes LANCE and he is electrocuted.
PIDGE says: ""Yeah, it is pretty cute."
ALLURA says: ""Shiro, I'm afraid your Bayard was lost with its Paladin."
SHIRO says: ""I guess I'll just have to make do."
The Red Lion.
The gathers in the Bridge of the Castle of Lions.
ALLURA says: ""You'll need to retrieve the Red Lion from Sendak's ship."
KEITH says: ""That's a.."
KEITH says: "pretty big ship."
KEITH says: "How are we gonna know where the Red Lion is?"
PIDGE says: ""Oh, it's not a matter of 'we'."
PIDGE says: "It's a matter of 'you'."
HUNK says: ""Pidge is right."
HUNK says: "Once we get you in, you'll be able to feel its presence and track it down."
LANCE says: ""Yeah."
LANCE says: "You know how you felt that crazy energy while we were in the desert?"
KEITH says: ""Yeah."
KEITH says: "You made fun of me for that."
LANCE says: ""And I'm proud of that, but turns out it's exactly like that mumbo-jumbo."
ALLURA says: ""Keith, remember, the Red Lion is extremely temperamental."
ALLURA says: "You'll have to earn its respect."
SHIRO says: ""All right."
SHIRO says: "Here's our plan of attack."
SHIRO narrates their plan as it proceeds.
SHIRO says: ""The Galra Empire knows about the Blue and Yellow Lion, but they don't know we have the Green Lion, too."
SHIRO says: "Hunk, Lance, you'll act as a decoy by pretending to give yourselves up."
LANCE and HUNK approach the Galra warship with the Blue Lion and Yellow Lion. PIDGE flies to the underside of the warship with the Green Lion undetected. LANCE sends SENDAK a transmission.
LANCE says: ""Attention, Galra ship."
LANCE says: "Do not fire."
LANCE says: "We're surrendering our Lions."
The transmission ends.
LANCE says: ""Hope this works."
SHIRO says: ""While Sendak is distracted, Keith, Pidge, and I will sneak onto the ship in the Green Lion."
SHIRO says: "Keith and I will find the Red Lion while Pidge guards our exit."
SHIRO says: "Hunk, Lance, find some way to take down that ion cannon."
PIDGE docks the Green Lion undereneath the warship, and then cuts a hole into the warship's hull. SHIRO, KEITH, and PIDGE infiltrate inside. The Paladins communicate through their helmets.
LANCE says: ""Pidge, what's your ETA?"
PIDGE says: ""We're in."
SENDAK says: ""Activate tractor beam."
The Galra warship unleashes a bright light.
HUNK says: ""What's that thing?"
LANCE says: ""I think that's our signal to get out of here!"
LANCE and HUNK pilot their Lions to flee the tractor beam.
SENDAK says: ""They lied to us."
SENDAK says: "Launch fighters!"
Galra fighter jets deply from the warship.
LANCE says: ""Hunk, you dismantle the ion cannon while I take these jerks on a space ride!"
HUNK says: ""Ten-four!"
Inside the Galra warship, SHIRO has an unnerving flashback.
SHIRO says: ""I've been here before."
SHIRO says: "After I was taken by the Galra cruiser off Kerberos, they brought us here."
PIDGE says: ""So, that means your other crewmembers, they might be held captive here."
PIDGE says: "We..."
PIDGE says: "We've got to rescue them."
SHIRO says: ""Pidge, we don't have time."
SHIRO says: "We have to get the Red Lion and get back to Arus."
PIDGE says: ""But we can't just leave prisoners here!"
SHIRO says: ""Look, no one understands that more than me, but, in war, we have to make hard choices."
SHIRO says: "Now, let's get moving."
PIDGE says: ""No!"
PIDGE says: "Commander Holt is my father."
PIDGE says: "He and my brother were the ones on the Kerberos Mission with you."
SHIRO says: ""Commander Holt is your father?"
PIDGE says: ""Yes."
PIDGE says: "I've been searching everywhere for him and my brother."
PIDGE says: "And I'm not going to give up looking when I'm this close."
PIDGE says: "I won't!"
SHIRO says: ""I'm coming with you."
KEITH says: ""What?"
SHIRO says: ""I remember where the prisoners are held."
SHIRO says: "Keith, you go find the Red Lion."
KEITH says: ""By myself?"
SHIRO says: ""Minor change of plans."
SHIRO says: "You'll be fine."
SHIRO says: "Just remember, patience yields focus."
A door opens nearby.
SHIRO says: ""So—"
SHIRO says: "Run!"
The three part ways, SHIRO gong with PIDGE. KEITH runs along a corridor and stops at an intersecting corridor.
KEITH says: ""Great."
KEITH says: "Now, which way?"
KEITH stares at a Galra Emblem until footsteps from sentries start approaching, and then runs. Out in space, HUNK tries slamming into the warship's ion cannon but is blocked by a force field.
HUNK says: ""What the Quiznak?"
HUNK says: "What is that?"
HUNK says: "A force field?"
On Arus, ALLURA tries to activate the Castleship's particle barrier.
ALLURA says: ""Particle barrier up!"
The particle barrier almost activates, but fails.
CORAN says: ""Is that what's supposed to happen?"
ALLURA and CORAN look inside the Castleship's systems through a small hole.
CORAN says: ""All the barrier crystals are out of alignment!"
ALLURA says: ""We have to fix it immediately."
ALLURA says: "Without the particle barrier, we'll be defenseless."
CORAN says: ""We're both too big."
CORAN says: "What can we do?"
The Altean Mice run inside the small hole squeaking.
ALLURA says: ""The mice!"
CORAN says: ""How do they know how to do this?"
ALLURA says: ""I can hear them talking to me."
ALLURA says: "I think our minds are connected."
ALLURA says: "It must be from sharing the sleep pod for 10,000 years."
The Altean Mice put the crystals back in alignment.
ALLURA says: ""Thank you, friends."
CORAN appears to be focusing intensely on the Altean Mice.
ALLURA says: ""Coran, what are you doing?"
CORAN says: ""I'm trying to get them to make me a sandwich."
KEITH runs through the warship, but ends up at the same Galra emblem as before.
KEITH says: ""You've got to be kidding me!"
KEITH says: "..."
KEITH says: "'Patience..."
KEITH says: "yields focus..."
KEITH calms himself and focuses inwardly, finally sensing the Red Lion.
KEITH says: ""Gotcha!"
KEITH runs off to claim the Lion. SHIRO and PIDGE come across a Galra drone. PIDGE fires a beam from the Green Paladin armor before it can react.
SHIRO says: ""That thing saw us."
SHIRO says: "We should get out of here."
PIDGE says: ""Wait."
PIDGE says: "I think this might come in handy."
PIDGE reconfigures the drone.
PIDGE says: ""Now, I'll just reset the controls..."
PIDGE says: "and it's working for us!"
PIDGE says: "I'm going to call you "Rover."
PIDGE says: "" Follow me!"
ROVER follows obediently. SHIRO leads PIDGE to the prisoners' cell and PIDGE orders ROVER to assist.
PIDGE says: ""Open up."
ROVER activates the cell door.
SHIRO says: ""Excellent, Pidge."
PIDGE says: ""Dad?"
SHIRO and PIDGE enter the cell, but only find aliens.
SHIRO says: ""Don't be afraid."
SHIRO says: "We're here to help you escape."
XI says: ""It's you..."
XI says: "It's you, the Champion."
XI says: "If anyone can get us out of here, he can."
SHIRO says: ""Wh..."
SHIRO says: "What did you call me?"
PIDGE says: ""We don't have much time."
SHIRO says: ""Let's get to the escape pods."
SHIRO says: "Let's go."
SHIRO says: "Come on!"
SHIRO motions for the aliens to follow them and they comply. Out in space, LANCE is dodging the Galra fighter jets while HUNK struggles to take down the icon cannon's force field.
LANCE says: ""Whoa-ho-ho!"
LANCE says: "Yeah, buddy!"
LANCE says: "This is way more fun without Hunk's barfing!"
KEITH approaches the Red Lion in the hangar on SENDAK's warship.
KEITH says: ""Bingo."
KEITH says: "Let's get out of here."
KEITH says: "Open up."
KEITH places his hand on the Lion's force field and nothing happens.
KEITH says: ""It's me."
KEITH says: "Keith."
KEITH says: "Your buddy."
KEITH says: "It's me!"
KEITH says: "Keeeeeeiiiiith, your—"
KEITH says: "I."
KEITH says: "AM."
KEITH says: "YOUR."
KEITH says: "PALADIN!"
Nothing happens; KEITH knocks on the force field. Galra sentries appear and fire laser guns. KEITH blocks them with his armor's shield.
KEITH says: ""I'm bonding with you!"
KEITH says: "Hey!"
KEITH says: "Come on!"
KEITH says: "We're connected!"
The Red Lion does not react. KEITH summons his Bayard as a katar and fights the sentries.
KEITH says: ""You're not getting this lion!"
KEITH is knocked back by laser fire. He activates the airlock doors to send the sentries into space, but is sucked out himself. The Red Lion comes to his rescue and catches him in its mouth, accepting him as its Paladin. KEITH takes a seat in the cockpit.
KEITH says: ""Good kitty."
KEITH says: "Let's roll."
SHIRO and PIDGE bring the prisoners to the escape pods.
PIDGE says: ""Hurry!"
SENTRY says: ""Halt!"
The sentries suround them. SHIRO's prosthetic arm painfully activates, glowing. The sound around SHIRO is distorted.
PIDGE says: ""Shiro?"
PIDGE says: "Shiro, what's wrong?!"
PIDGE says: "!"
SHIRO settles, and the sound around him returns to normal. He attacks the sentries at high speed with impressive strenth and his glowing arm. The prisoners leave in the escape pod.
XI says: ""Thank you, Shiro."
SHIRO says: ""Wait!"
SHIRO says: "How do you..."
SHIRO says: "?"
PIDGE says: ""Shiro, that was amazing!"
PIDGE says: "Where did you learn to fight with that?"
SHIRO says: ""No idea."
In space, HUNK uses the Yellow Lion's mouth cannon on the force field.
HUNK says: ""Come on, just break, you stupid thing!"
The force field finally breaks.
HUNK says: ""Score one for Hunk!"
HUNK slams the Yellow Lion into the ion cannon, disfiguring it. The Red Lion, Blue Lion, and Green Lion appear.
HUNK says: ""You guys made it!"
PIDGE says: ""Kitty Rose has left the stage!"
LANCE says: ""Let's get the heck out of here!"
HUNK says: ""I hope I stopped that cannon."
HUNK says: "I could barely make a dent in it!"
Inside the Galra warship.
HAXUS says: ""They stole the Red Lion!"
SENDAK says: ""After them!"
SENDAK says: "Either we get those Lions or we blow this whole planet to cosmic dust!"
SENDAK says: "Fire the ion cannon!"
HAXUS says: ""Sir, the ion cannon has been damaged."
SENDAK says: ""Then, send the drones to fix it!"
Forming Voltron.
In the Castle of Lions, the four claimed Lions activate the door securing the Black Lion as SHIRO stands before it. They all roar to show SHIRO is the new Black Paladin. CORAN cheers and ALLURA is relieved. The Castleship's alarms blare to alert them SENDAK's warship is approaching.
CORAN says: ""Oh, Quiznak!"
ALLURA says: ""Sendak is entering the Arusian atmosphere."
ALLURA says: "We need Voltron now!"
SHIRO eneters the Black Lion, and all five Lions launch from the Castleship.
HAXUS says: ""The ion cannon is back online!"
SENDAK says: ""Fire!"
The warships fires its cannon and blasts the Castleship; everyone is shaken from the blast, but survives.
HUNK says: ""Man, those Galra guys repair things fast."
CORAN says: ""The barrier gets weaker with every blast."
CORAN says: "Once that shield goes down, the Castle will be defenseless."
ALLURA says: ""I can give you cover with the Castle defenses for a while, but you have to form Voltron now or we'll all be destroyed!"
HUNK says: ""Jeez, no pressure."
A second blast from the ion cannon hits, weakening the barrier.
SHIRO says: ""Listen up, Team Voltron!"
SHIRO says: "The only way to succeed is to give it all you've got!"
SHIRO says: "This looks bad, but we can do this!"
SHIRO says: "Are you with me?"
LANCE, HUNK, PIDGE, and KEITH all nod silently.
HUNK says: ""I'm nodding."
HUNK says: "Is everyone else nodding?"
LANCE says: ""Yes."
PIDGE says: ""Yes."
KEITH says: ""Yes."
SHIRO says: ""Let's do this!"
The Lions run forward and exit the barrier under heavy fire from Galra fighter jets.
LANCE says: ""Uh, how?"
SHIRO says: ""Good question."
SHIRO says: "Does anyone have any ideas of how to form Voltron?"
HUNK says: ""I don't see a "Combine Into Giant Robot" button anywhere on my dashboard."
The Galra fighter jets bombard them with attacks.
PIDGE says: ""This is insane!"
PIDGE says: "Can't they just cease fire for one minute so we can figure this out?"
PIDGE says: "Is that too much to ask?"
Pidge loses temper and attacks the fighter jets, destroying two. KEITH fires the Red Lion's tail cannon to destroy two more.
KEITH says: ""We've got to do something."
HUNK says: ""Combine!"
HUNK slams the Yellow Lion into the Red Lion, knocking it over.
KEITH says: ""Hey!"
HUNK says: ""Okay, that didn't work."
ALLURA speaks to SHIRO onscreen.
ALLURA says: ""Quickly, Paladins!"
ALLURA says: "Our energy levels are getting low!"
SHIRO says: ""Maybe if we fly in formation, we'll just combine."
SHIRO says: "Take off on my cue."
SHIRO says: "One, two, three, Voltron!"
The Lions take flight.
KEITH says: ""Here we go!"
LANCE says: ""Come on, come on!"
SHIRO says: ""Nothing's happening."
LANCE says: ""Hey, w-wait, wait, wait!"
LANCE says: "I feel something!"
HUNK says: ""I do, too."
HUNK says: "I feel it."
HUNK says: "It's like we're all being pulled in the same direction!"
SHIRO says: ""Uh, guys, I think I know why."
SHIRO says: "Look up."
The Lions are caught in the Galra warship's tractor beam and are unable to escape.
LANCE says: ""What the cheese?"
PIDGE says: ""Sendak's ship is sucking us in like a black hole!"
SENDAK says: ""Send a report to Emperor Zarkon: 'The day is ours."
The warship blasts the Castle of Lions particle barrier, destroying it.
SHIRO says: ""Oh, no!"
HUNK says: ""I-I don't care what you say, Shiro."
HUNK says: "I'm panicking now!"
HUNK starts screaming.
PIDGE says: ""It can't end here!"
LANCE says: ""This is it!"
KEITH says: ""It's been an honor flying with you boys."
HUNK says: ""Oh, no!"
SHIRO says: ""No!"
SHIRO says: "We can do this."
SHIRO says: "We have to believe in ourselves."
SHIRO says: "We can't give up."
SHIRO says: "We are the universe's only hope."
SHIRO says: "Everyone is relying on us."
SHIRO says: "We can't fail!"
SHIRO says: "We won't fail!"
SHIRO says: "If we work together, we'll win together!"
ALL says: ""Yeah!"
The Paladins are united and the Lions break free to form Voltron, saving the Castle of Lions from destruction by diverting the blast with a single punch to the cannon.
SENDAK says: ""Voltron!"
KEITH says: ""I can't believe it!"
PIDGE says: ""We formed Voltron!"
HUNK says: ""I'm a leg!"
LANCE says: ""How are we doing this?"
SHIRO says: ""I don't know, but let's get that cannon!"
While Voltron destroys the warship, SENDAK and HAXUS flee. ALLURA and CORAN meet the exhausted Paladins in front of the Castle of Lions.
ALLURA says: ""Good work, Paladins!"
LANCE says: ""Thanks, pretty lady."
SHIRO says: ""We did it."
KEITH says: ""Heck yeah, we did."
SHIRO says: ""How did we do it?"
HUNK says: ""I was just, like, screaming the whole time."
HUNK says: "Maybe that did it."
PIDGE looks dejected from not finding either missing family member; SHIRO places a hand on PIDGE's shoulder.
SHIRO says: ""We're not going to stop searching until we find your brother and father."
SHIRO says: "Wherever they are, I know they'd be proud of you."
PIDGE smiles.
ALLURA says: ""We won the battle, but the war has only just begun."
ALLURA says: "I'm afraid Zarkon will not stop until he gets these Lions."
CORAN says: ""Good thing you Paladins know what you're doing, because you're going to have to form Voltron again and again."
HUNK says: ""Totally—"
HUNK says: "Wait, what?"
LANCE says: ""We barely survived forming Voltron this one time."
CORAN says: ""And you only had to fight one ship."
CORAN says: "Wait until you have to fight a whole fleet of them!"
CORAN says: "It's not going to be easy being the Defenders of the Universe."
The Paladins appear surprised at the title; they look at their Lions.
SHIRO says: ""Defenders of the Universe, huh?"
SHIRO says: "That's got a nice ring to it."
Episode ends with everyone smiling at the Lions.
