ALLURA says: ""I loved the smell of the mountain juniberries in the early morning breeze."
ALFOR says: ""As did I, Allura."
ALLURA says: ""Remember the summer berry festival?"
ALLURA says: "People would come from all over Altea for the harvest."
ALFOR says: ""I remember how the berry juice stained your favorite dress."
ALFOR says: "You were so upset."
ALLURA laughs.
ALLURA says: ""It took forever for Mother to calm me."
ALLURA frowns.
ALLURA says: ""I miss Altea so much."
ALLURA says: "I miss you, Father."
ALLURA says: "I wish it didn't have to be this way."
ALFOR says: ""I know, Allura, but, as leaders, we have to do what's right for our people, even if it means great sacrifice."
ALLURA says: ""I know, Father."
ALLURA says: "That's what you always say."
CORAN enters.
CORAN says: ""Princess, there you are."
CORAN says: "What are you doing up and about?"
CORAN says: "You should be resting."
ALLURA says: ""Oh, Coran, can't I stay?"
CORAN says: ""The Balmera rejuvenation ceremony took a lot out of you."
CORAN says: "Come along, to your room."
CORAN helps ALLURA stand.
KING ALFOR says: ""Get your rest, darling."
KING ALFOR says: "I will be here for you when you're well."
ALLURA says: ""I love you, Father."
ALLURA says: "I'll see you soon."
CORAN takes ALLURA away; when the Memory Chamber ends the hologram, KING ALFOR's display flickers before disappearing.
Sleeping Commander.
PIDGE is studying the Galra Crystal in the Green Lion's hangar. CORAN speaks over the intercom.
CORAN says: ""Pidge, please come down to the detainment room."
PIDGE is frustrated from being interrupted by complies; the Crystal glows ominously. PIDGE meets CORAN and the other Paladins in front of the pod where SENDAK is held. CORAN places devices on SENDAK's pod.
CORAN says: ""Okay, guys, Sendak's almost all hooked up."
CORAN says: "But, look, I have to warn you, this technology was used to keep Altean memories alive, not to interrogate prisoners."
SHIRO says: ""Coran, we understand this isn't what the technology was meant for, but if we can extract Sendak's memories, we may gain valuable intelligence on Zarkon's troop locations."
LANCE says: ""Yeah, and then we can just be like, 'Knock-knock."
LANCE says: "' 'Who's there?"
LANCE says: "' 'The avenging fury of Voltron, son!"
PIDGE says: ""Fascinating."
PIDGE says: "So, how exactly does this work?"
CORAN says: ""As the memories are extracted, they're written bit by bit on individual molecules of the micro-storage strands."
LANCE says: ""When I go, I want all the stuff in my brain stored in a giant ship."
KEITH says: ""The amount of information in your brain could be stored in a paper airplane."
LANCE says: ""Oh, yeah?"
LANCE says: "Well, the amount of information you have, Keith, could be..."
KEITH says: ""..."
KEITH says: "Yeah?"
LANCE says: ""Uh..."
LANCE says: "it's less than what I have!"
HUNK says: ""Oh, good one, Lance!"
PIDGE says: ""So this is how you incorporated King Alfor's memories into the Castle of Lions?"
CORAN says: ""Precisely, but it's never been attempted before on an unwilling participant."
The memory storage device activates but nothing appears.
HUNK says: ""Uh, is this what's supposed to be happening?"
SHIRO says: ""Let's give it some time."
The Paladins and CORAN wait for a very, very long time with no results.
KEITH says: ""Well, I can't wait around anymore."
KEITH says: "I'm gonna to hit the training deck."
KEITH leaves. More time passes with no results.
PIDGE says: ""Okay, if anyone needs me, I'll be in the lab."
PIDGE says: "Maybe I can pull some information from Sendak's Galra Crystal."
PIDGE leaves. More time passes with no results.
HUNK says: ""Time to feed the beast."
HUNK says: "I'm going to go make some breakfast."
HUNK leaves.
CORAN says: ""Well, I'm afraid I can't wait here any longer, either."
CORAN says: "I have a million duties to attend to."
CORAN says: "Between that Galra Crystal infecting our system, and then fighting off those ships and performing the Balmeran rejuvenation ceremony, the old Castle of Lions has taken quite a beating."
CORAN says: "Every system needs to be recharged and repaired."
SHIRO says: ""I'll stay."
SHIRO says: "Somewhere in Sendak's mind is the information about Zarkon that we need."
LANCE says: ""Okay, well, while you guys do that, I think I'm gonna get my chill on."
LANCE says: "Maybe kick back with a lemonade or space juice."
LANCE says: "Something."
LANCE tries to leave.
CORAN says: ""Oh, hold on there, space juice."
CORAN says: "You're going to come and help me."
LANCE says: ""What?"
LANCE says: "Why?"
LANCE says: "Why me?"
CORAN says: ""Because you're the last one here and because your activity isn't very important."
LANCE says: ""Wait, did I say 'chill with a good lemonade'?"
LANCE says: "I meant I gotta do homework."
CORAN says: ""No."
CORAN says: "Too late."
CORAN starts leaving.
LANCE says: ""Fine..."
LANCE says: "Let us know if anything happens."
LANCE begins walking away. SHIRO does not reply.
LANCE says: ""Shiro?"
SHIRO says: ""Y-You got it."
LANCE leaves. SHIRO remains staring at SENDAK.
The Castle Attacks.
Malfunction.
HUNK is in the kitchen trying to get food.
HUNK says: ""Maybe today, we try a little crème goo-lée."
The food goo dispenser will not work. HUNK looks inside the tube and clicks the lever. Goo explodes on his face.
HUNK says: ""Agh, my eye!"
The goo dispenser rapidly shoots goo everywhere. PIDGE walks by and sees the chaos.
PIDGE says: ""What is going on in here?!"
PIDGE says: "!"
HUNK is hiding behind a counter.
HUNK says: ""The goo has me pinned down!"
HUNK and PIDGE hide behind the counter together. PIDGE pulls out plates and hands one to HUNK.
PIDGE says: ""Okay, we're going to have to flank the goo to shut it down."
HUNK says: ""Okay, wait."
HUNK says: "Wait!"
HUNK says: "It's been a pleasure cooking with you."
HUNK salutes PIDGE.
HUNK says: ""Go!"
HUNK and PIDGE rush the goo dispenser from either side using plates as shields. PIDGE pins the goo dispenser tube down while HUNK ties the tube in a knot, stopping it and making it overflow.
PIDGE says: ""Probably a malfunction?"
HUNK says: ""Yeah, yeah..."
HUNK says: "Guess the kitchen system needs to be rebooted, too."
PIDGE says: ""Leave it for Coran?"
HUNK nods; both HUNK and PIDGE leave the kitchen a mess. Meanwhile, LANCE is cleaning pods in the sleep chamber with CORAN.
LANCE says: ""Ugh..."
LANCE says: "Since when did 'you sleep in it, you clean it' become a Voltron rule?"
LANCE says: "Also, how is it these pods have the ability to heal a human from near death, but don't have the ability to clean themselves?"
CORAN laughs.
CORAN says: ""Oh, self-cleaning pods."
CORAN says: "Now, that's a good one!"
CORAN says: "You know, this kind of reminds me of my time as a young cadet."
CORAN says: "I had just enlisted in the Altean space squad, aeronautics sub-tech nano-weaponry unit, and I was sent off to boot camp."
CORAN says: "Our sergeant had us cleaning cryo-pods day and night."
CORAN says: "I got so good at it, I earned my first set of stripes!"
CORAN continues talking as LANCE gets trapped in a pod. LANCE screams.
LANCE says: ""Oh—"
LANCE says: "Coran!"
LANCE says: "Hey!"
LANCE says: "Hey!"
LANCE says: "H-Hey!"
LANCE knocks on the pod from the inside; CORAN does not hear.
CORAN says: ""—"
CORAN says: "Oh, those were the days."
CORAN says: "Anyway, you keep up the good work and maybe someday you'll earn some cleaning stripes, too."
The pod holding LANCE descends into the floor. CORAN looks around.
CORAN says: ""Lance?"
CORAN says: "Lance!"
CORAN says: "Ah, Paladins..."
CORAN believes LANCE has left.
Deadly Robot.
KEITH is in the training deck fighting the Gladiator robot. He destroys it.
KEITH says: ""Start training level three."
A new Gladiator robot dispenses from the ceiling and KEITH battles it. The fight is too intense.
KEITH says: ""End training sequence."
The system does not respond; the Gladiator robot turns rogue and rushes KEITH.
KEITH says: ""End training sequence!"
KEITH says: "End training sequence now!"
KEITH is knocked aside by the Gladiator robot and loses his Bayard. He dodges the robot's attacks to recover his Bayard and flee into the hallway for safety. The Gladiator robot forces its way into the hall to follow KEITH. SHIRO remains unaware of the chaos as he stands before SENDAK's pod in the detainment room.
SHIRO says: ""I know you're in there, Sendak."
SHIRO says: "I know you have all the answers."
SHIRO says: "Give them to me."
Nothing happens. SHIRO slams his fist on SENDAK's pod.
SHIRO says: ""You're a broken soldier!"
SHIRO says: "You can't hold out forever!"
A memory finally enters the storage system. SHIRO smiles.
SHIRO says: ""So, you can hear me."
Haunted.
CORAN is cleaning pods in the sleep chamber. He yells when he sees LANCE trapped in the next pod he intends to clean. CORAN releases LANCE from the pod. LANCE is stiff with cold.
LANCE says: ""Ah, ah..."
LANCE says: "This pod just shut on me and locked me in, while you were rambling on about boot camp!"
CORAN says: ""You sure you didn't just trip and fall in?"
CORAN says: "No judgment."
CORAN says: "It happens."
CORAN says: "Besides, why would the pod automatically lock and start the cryogenic freezing process?"
LANCE puts on his coat for warmth.
LANCE says: ""To kill me!"
CORAN says: ""Don't get your boots in a bunch."
CORAN says: "My guess is they're malfunctioning."
LANCE says: ""Okay, I'm gonna float this out there."
LANCE says: "I think this Castle is haunted."
CORAN says: ""The ship might seem like a fantastical, magical creature to you, but it's really just a big embodiment of advanced supernatural technology that cannot be explained by science alone."
LANCE looks at CORAN in disbelief.
CORAN says: ""Well, that does make it seem a bit haunted, doesn't it?"
CORAN says: "Ah, but it's not."
CORAN says: "Trust me, nothing out of the ordinary is happening here."
CORAN leaves. LANCE hears rumbling and begins whimpering.
LANCE says: ""I'm okay."
LANCE says: "I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay..."
The pod that trapped LANCE descends into the floor, startling LANCE and making him scream in fear. LANCE runs out of the sleep chamber. Meanwhile, ALLURA is asleep in her room next to the Altean Mice. KING ALFOR's voice can be heard.
ALFOR says: ""Allura..."
ALFOR says: "Allura?"
KING ALFOR's holographic AI appears, waking ALLURA.
ALFOR says: ""Allura, dear daughter..."
ALLURA says: ""Father, what are you doing here?"
LANCE has left the sleep chamber and is walking through the Castleship's halls. The lights in front of him begin turning off, terrifying him.
LANCE says: ""Okay, okay..."
LANCE says: "Oh..."
LANCE says: "Ah—"
LANCE says: "!"
LANCE sees a flickering image of KING ALFOR.
LANCE says: ""Coran, is that you?"
LANCE says: "Okay, stop messing with me, guys."
LANCE says: "This isn't funny."
LANCE hears CORAN's voice.
"CORAN" says: ""Help!"
"CORAN" says: "Help!"
LANCE says: ""Hello?"
LANCE says: "Coran?"
LANCE rushes down the dark hall.
"CORAN" says: ""Help!"
"CORAN" says: "Somebody!"
The voice becomes slightly distorted.
"CORAN" says: ""I'm trapped in the airlock."
LANCE says: ""I'm coming!"
LANCE enters the airlock and sees no one. The door closes behind him.
LANCE says: ""Huh?"
LANCE says: "Okay, ha-ha."
LANCE says: "Good joke."
LANCE says: "You guys got me."
LANCE says: "Nice."
Alarms start blaring.
COMPUTER says: ""Airlock opening in 30 ticks."
LANCE says: ""Okay, joke's over!"
LANCE says: "You got me!"
COMPUTER says: ""..."
COMPUTER says: "29, 28, 27..."
LANCE bangs on the airlock door.
LANCE says: ""Guys?"
LANCE says: "Guys!"
LANCE says: "Eugh!"
LANCE says: "Help!"
No one is around to hear LANCE.
Corruption.
SHIRO is in the detainment room interrogating SENDAK, who is still asleep in his pod.
SHIRO says: ""What was the first rank you held in Zarkon's army?"
SHIRO says: "Where did you find the Red Lion?"
SHIRO says: "What is Zarkon's greatest weakness?"
SHIRO hears SENDAK's voice, becoming startled.
"SENDAK" says: ""What makes you think you can possibly defeat him?"
SENDAK's mouth is not moving and he remains asleep.
"SHIRO" says: ""If you were to attack Zarkon, where would you strike?"
"SENDAK" says: ""Why strike at all when you can join him?"
SHIRO sees an image of SENDAK awake, but the commander is still asleep.
PIDGE says: ""I bet if we can modulate the dynamics of this crystal, we'll be able to reverse engineer a lot of Galra tech."
PIDGE says: "Don't you think, Hunk?"
PIDGE says: "Hunk, are you paying attention?"
HUNK says: ""What?"
HUNK says: "No, I'm sorry."
HUNK says: "That whole food goo ambush really set me on edge, Pidge."
HUNK says: "If we can't trust food, we are lost as a culture."
PIDGE says: ""Relax."
PIDGE says: "I'm sure the Castle's just glitchy."
It's 10,000 years old.".
HUNK says: ""Yeah, it does seem like the ship is not currently trying to kill us."
HUNK says: "Okay, so, all the sensors are on the crystal."
HUNK says: "Hit the switch."
PIDGE says: ""Hunk, did you accidentally hit the anti-gravity switch?"
HUNK says: ""Uh, no."
HUNK says: "There's no anti-gravity switch."
HUNK says: "Uh, is there?"
PIDGE says: ""Curse my short arms!"
HUNK says: ""Oh, I hate those little things!"
HUNK says: "All right, forget it, Pidge."
HUNK says: "I'm going to swim toward you."
HUNK says: "Just hang on!"
HUNK says: ""That's it."
HUNK says: "I'm all out of moves."
HUNK says: "Oh, I'm hungry again."
HUNK says: "I hope some food goo comes oozing out of these walls."
LANCE says: ""Help!"
LANCE says: "Help!"
LANCE says: "Help!"
COMPUTER says: ""..."
COMPUTER says: "twelve, eleven, ten..."
COMPUTER says: "nine, eight, seven..."
LANCE says: ""Keith!"
COMPUTER says: ""..."
COMPUTER says: "six, five..."
KEITH says: ""What are you doing in there?"
LANCE says: ""I need help!"
LANCE says: "Because if you don't get me out of here right now, I'm going to be sucked out into space!"
COMPUTER says: ""Doors opening."
LANCE says: ""I'm getting sucked out into space!"
LANCE says: ""Keith!"
LANCE says: "Keith, come on!"
KEITH says: ""What were you doing out there?"
LANCE says: ""Who was that guy?"
KEITH says: ""He was trying to kill me!"
LANCE says: ""Well, is he the Castle?"
LANCE says: "Because that's who's trying to kill me!"
KING ALFOR says: ""Alteans flowers are the most beautiful."
ALLURA says: ""It is sad that I will only see them in my dreams."
ALLURA says: "But, when I wake, my memories are like these spores, scattered in the wind."
KING ALFOR says: ""Altea is not merely a dream, Allura."
KING ALFOR says: "It still exists."
KING ALFOR says: "The Alteans flower, you can see it."
KING ALFOR says: "You can touch it."
KING ALFOR says: "I can take you there."
KING ALFOR says: "I can take you home."
ALLURA says: ""You can?"
KING ALFOR says: ""Would you like to go home?"
ALLURA says: ""Yes."
ALLURA says: "I want to go back to Altea, Father."
KING ALFOR says: ""Then come with me, and I will show you the way."
Mouse squeak.
PIDGE says: ""Wait."
PIDGE says: "Wait, wait."
PIDGE says: "I have an idea."
PIDGE says: "Grab on!"
HUNK says: ""Yeah!"
HUNK says: "We did it!"
HUNK says: "Now, what?"
PIDGE says: ""Now, kick me as hard as you can!"
HUNK says: ""What?"
HUNK says: "No, we're friends."
PIDGE says: ""No, no."
PIDGE says: "Kick me so I can fly across the room and get to the control panel."
PIDGE says: ""Oh..."
PIDGE says: "oh, oh!"
PIDGE says: "No, no, no!"
LANCE says: ""How can you guys be taking a nap while this castle is trying to kill us?"
HUNK says: ""Taking a nap?"
HUNK says: "We've been floating around in Zero G!"
HUNK says: "You know how scary that is?"
LANCE says: ""That's not scary!"
LANCE says: "That's fun!"
LANCE says: "I was almost ejected into space!"
HUNK says: ""I got attacked by killer food, and that's the most horrifying thing you can imagine!"
HUNK says: "The stuff of nightmares!"
HUNK says: "It'll haunt me to my grave!"
KEITH says: ""Well, I had a robot trying to kill me!"
LANCE says: ""I don't care what you say, Coran."
LANCE says: "This castle has gone apples and bananas!"
CORAN says: "" Perhaps the infection from Sendak's Galra crystal is worse than we thought."
HUNK says: ""Well, let's get rid of it."
CORAN says: ""It's too late."
CORAN says: "When Sendak plugged it into the ship, it corrupted the entire system."
KEITH says: ""Sendak?"
KEITH says: "Wait."
KEITH says: "Has anyone seen Shiro?"
SENDAK says: ""We're connected, you and me."
SENDAK says: "Both part of the Galra Empire."
SHIRO says: ""No!"
SHIRO says: "I'm not like you."
SENDAK says: ""You've been broken and reformed."
SENDAK says: "Just look at your hand."
SHIRO says: ""That's not me!"
SENDAK says: ""It's the strongest part of you."
SENDAK says: "Embrace it."
SENDAK says: "The others don't know what you know."
SENDAK says: "They haven't seen what you've seen."
SENDAK says: "Face it."
SENDAK says: "You'll never beat Zarkon."
SENDAK says: "He's already defeated you."
SHIRO says: ""I'm not listening to you!"
SENDAK says: ""Do you really think a monster like you could be a Voltron Paladin?"
SHIRO says: ""Stop it!"
Alarms blare.
KING ALFOR says: ""I remember how you used to dance around this very ballroom."
KING ALFOR says: "I can still hear you giggling."
ALLURA says: ""Oh..."
ALLURA says: "Those were happy memories."
KING ALFOR says: ""We can create new memories, Allura."
PIDGE says: ""Shiro, are you okay?"
KEITH says: ""Where's Sendak?"
SHIRO says: ""I..."
SHIRO says: "I had to get him out of here."
SHIRO says: "I was hearing his voice."
SHIRO says: "He..."
SHIRO says: "He can't be trusted on this ship."
LANCE says: ""It is the ship!"
LANCE says: "I got stuck in a cryo-pod, then, in an airlock."
LANCE says: "Keith got attacked by a robot, and Hunk and Pidge got attacked by food."
LANCE says: "It's been a weird morning."
Computer beep.
CORAN says: ""What?"
CORAN says: "How is that possible?"
KEITH says: ""What is it?"
CORAN says: ""The ship is starting a wormhole jump!"
SHIRO says: ""Allura, what's going on?"
ALLURA says: ""We're going to Altea."
ALLURA says: "We're going home."
ALLURA says: "My father is taking us."
KING ALFOR says: ""Stay away from my daughter!"
HUNK says: ""Uh..."
SHIRO says: ""Allura, wake up!"
CORAN says: ""The crystal must have corrupted King Alfor's artificial intelligence."
CORAN says: "It's taking over!"
PIDGE says: ""We're headed straight for a star and it's about to explode!"
ALLURA says: ""Father, I can see Altea."
CORAN says: ""Allura!"
CORAN says: "Allura, wake up!"
CORAN says: "What you're seeing isn't real."
ALLURA says: ""The juniberries, the most exquisite flower of all."
CORAN says: ""Allura, please!"
CORAN says: "You've got to listen to me!"
ALLURA says: ""Is this real?"
KING ALFOR says: ""Of course it is real, Daughter."
KING ALFOR says: "That flower you're touching is real."
CORAN says: ""But where is the fragrance of the sweet juniberries?"
Allura sniffs the fake flower.
ALLURA says: ""Huh?"
ALLURA says: ""That's not Altea."
PIDGE says: ""When that star goes supernova, it will destroy the entire system."
PIDGE says: "Allura, you must reset the course and get us out of here!"
ALLURA says: ""Father, please, I beg you to turn this ship around."
ALLURA says: "If we don't do it soon, we will all perish!"
KING ALFOR says: ""I know."
KING ALFOR says: "That is my intention."
ALLURA says: ""What?"
ALLURA says: "Why?"
KING ALFOR says: ""Don't you see, dear daughter?"
KING ALFOR says: "Zarkon can never be defeated."
KING ALFOR says: "He's been ruling for ten thousand years."
ALLURA says: ""But we must continue to fight!"
KING ALFOR says: ""Fight for what?"
KING ALFOR says: "It is all over for Altea."
KING ALFOR says: "You don't have to live a lifetime of war."
KING ALFOR says: "You can be with me and the rest of your people."
ALLURA says: ""Father, please!"
ALLURA says: "The paladins and I can still stop Zarkon!"
ALLURA says: "Somewhere in there, you must want that to happen."
KING ALFOR says: ""Allura, my A."
KING ALFOR says: "I."
KING ALFOR says: "has been corrupted."
KING ALFOR says: "You must disconnect my power source."
KING ALFOR says: ""We can stroll across the Blossom Canyon every morning, just like we used to."
KING ALFOR says: "Remember how much you loved that?"
ALLURA says: ""I remember."
ALLURA says: "I'll see you soon, Father."
ALLURA says: "I've got to get into the A."
ALLURA says: "I."
ALLURA says: "chamber to disconnect my father's power source manually."
CORAN says: ""But that means losing King Alfor forever!"
ALLURA says: ""Paladins, get to your Lions!"
ALLURA says: "I need you to slow the Castle's descent into the star."
CORAN says: ""I can try to override the system to open the hangars."
KING ALFOR says: ""Don't do this!"
KING ALFOR says: ""You must."
KING ALFOR says: ""All my memories, all my knowledge will be lost forever!"
KING ALFOR says: ""Do it, Allura."
KING ALFOR says: "If you are to live, we must say goodbye."
ALLURA says: ""I'm sorry about this, Father."
ALLURA says: ""Huh?"
KING ALFOR says: ""Oh, my dear daughter..."
Allura and Alfor laughing.
YOUNG ALLURA says: ""Father..."
ALLURA says: ""This is not real."
ALLURA says: "This is all in the past."
Alfor plays childhood memories.
KING ALFOR says: ""You don't have to fight, Allura."
KING ALFOR says: "You don't have to make this sacrifice."
ALLURA says: ""Goodbye, Father."
KING ALFOR says: ""Goodbye, Allura."
CORAN says: ""She did it."
Alarm blare.
ALLURA says: ""Paladins, get to your hangars."
ALLURA says: "We're getting out of here."
SHIRO says: ""I'm so sorry about your father, Princess."
HUNK says: ""We all are."
ALLURA says: ""Thank you."
ALLURA says: "But that was not my father."
ALLURA says: "The real King Alfor was a great man and a great father."
ALLURA says: "He may not be here with us anymore, but his dream lives on through all of us, and his legacy is Voltron."
Episode ends.
