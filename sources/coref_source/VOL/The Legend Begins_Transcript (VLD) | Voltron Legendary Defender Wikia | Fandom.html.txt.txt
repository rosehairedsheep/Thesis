Fade in to a close-up of Zarkon's face in profile, lying in a coma at Galra Central Command. Haggar stands over him, watching over him.
Haggar says: "Sire, forgive me for this, but..."
Haggar says: "I know no other way."
Haggar places her fingers on Zarkon's temples, which begin to glow with dark purple magic.
Haggar says: "Your empire needs you."
The camera zooms in on distant memories of his pastâ€”Galra ships attacking a planet; a man being supported by a woman, both of unknown species, as they are surrounded by Galra soldiers; quick transitions between the ruins of Daibazaal and the planet when it was still the Galra home; the Voltron lions with five people, including a younger Zarkon and Alfor, standing in front of them; a younger Zarkon at his wedding to an Altean woman; Zarkon standing behind Alfor as they discover the comet that created Voltron; and a last lingering shot of the Altean woman from Zarkon's perspective, smiling and laughing. Haggar looks up and gasps, eyes widening, before she regains her composure and continues.
Cut to the bridge of the Castle of Lions, where the universe map is at full display and Pidge is marking coordinates.
Pidge says: "He fought us here, his generals were here, and he stole the comet here."
Cut to a shot of Lance, Shiro, Keith, Hunk, Coran, and Allura all standing behind Pidge.
Lance says: "So..."
Lance says: "Lotor could be anywhere."
Shiro says: "We'll never be able to find him unless we can figure out his plan."
Shiro says: "We're totally missing the big picture."
Pidge says: "How about this question: why was Voltron made out of the same material as that comet?"
Pidge says: "What's so special about it?"
Medium shot of Allura, Coran, and Hunk.
Allura says: "My father discovered another comet like that before I was born."
Coran says: "Your father..."
Coran says: "and Zarkon."
Hunk says: "This is back when Zarkon was the Black Lion's paladin?"
Coran says: "Before that."
Coran says: "Before Alfor built the Lions."
Close-up of Shiro.
Shiro says: "I know this is painful to talk about, but if we're going to stop Lotor, it's time we heard the rest of the story."
Close-up of Coran.
Montage sequence begins with a quick pan upward to a profile shot of Zarkon, Alfor, the unnamed man and woman from Zarkon's memory, and another man from an unnamed species; Alfor investigating unfamiliar food with two of the unnamed leaders and four-eyed yak-like creatures behind him; close-up of a Galra sentry's helmet, then a quick dolly up to one of the unnamed leaders in the heat of battle with the Galra; Alfor negotiating a peace treaty between Zarkon and the leader who was previously battling his forces while the other two stand with them; dolly down through an image of all five leaders facing down various foes together, with Zarkon as their leader.
Coran says: "In the beginning, the paladins were just five leaders, who, despite coming from cultures which were vastly divergent, and in some cases had been warring for generations, managed to look past their differences in an effort to protect their common interests."
Coran says: "What was initially a formal agreement to work alongside each other soon blossomed into a true friendship."
Coran says: "A warrior's bond was forged, and together they worked to rid their system of those who would do it harm."
Dissolve to a group of masked bandits, two of whom run past one who is firing a blaster. Alfor gives chase, but is too late to follow them as they run into a cave and the door slides shut. The bandits wait, prepared to attack, before pebbles begin to fall from the ceiling. A bandit looks up just as Alfor drops in from above onto his head, having cut a hole through the cave roof. Alfor sweeps his cave aside and readies his sword before looking up, eyes widening as he realizes that he is badly outnumbered.
Alfor says: "Oh, dear."
The bandits charge toward him, many of them dual-wielding daggers. Alfor manages to fend some of them off before being body-checked from the side, his sword flying out of his hand. The bandit who struck him leaps on top of him, and Alfor strains to keep away the blades, which are mere centimeters from his face, before both he and the bandit look up at the sound of someone knocking people aside. Zarkon rushes forward, throwing bandits aside with a club and knocking away the one attacking Alfor in one swipe before uppercutting another. Quick pan to the two unnamed male leaders knocking bandits aside, then pan to the female leader striking three with her staff. Final cut to the last of the bandits hitting the wall and falling to the cave floor, unconscious. Zoom out to a wide shot of the cave floor, where the five leaders stand amidst the defeated bandits.
Zarkon says: "I keep warning you not to break formation and run ahead, Alfor."
Zarkon says: "You are much more knowledgable as an alchemist than a soldier."

Long shot of Zarkon's banquet table, where the five leaders, Alfor's wife, and Coran are all gathered and being served a meal by Galra waitstaff.
Blaytz says: "Pull up a bench and join the feast!"
Zarkon clears his throat offscreen; Blaytz looks startled and disgruntled. Medium shot of Zarkon, who is handing his goblet to another servant.
Zarkon says: "You know that fraternizing with the servant class is not permitted."
Zarkon says: "It erodes discipline."
Alfor says: "Well, perhaps a little bit of  discipline erosion would do you good, Zarkon."
Medium shot of Zarkon.
Zarkon says: "Something I will consider, the next time you are surrounded by Lambonite scavengers."
Shot of Coran, Alfor, and Alfor's wife.
Alfor says: "I was handling myself."
Gyrgan says: "You mean, wetting yourself?"
Alfor glares at him as Trigel, Blaytz, Gyrgan, and Coran burst out laughing, Blaytz doing a spit take and Coran hitting his head on the back of Alfor's chair. Even Alfor's wife has a laugh at his expense.
Alfor says: "Why I ever joined up with this band of scoundrels, I'll never know."
Cut to Trigel.
Trigel says: "Because we're the only 'band of scoundrels' that would have you."
Trigel says: "To us!"
Suddenly, Trigel and Blaytz look up and gasp as the ground starts to rumble and the sky above them is lit up orange. Cut to close-up of Gyrgan.
Gyrgan says: "By Willow!"
Pan up from the table to the ceiling as the skylight gives them all a view of a comet shooting overhead. Exterior shot of Zarkon's palace and the city beyond as the comet smashes into the ground beyond the mountains, a massive dust cloud and shockwave in its wake.

Wide shot of the crater, where a black comet with glowing blue cracks, exactly like the one Team Voltron retrieved from the alternate reality, stands upright in the center. Dissolve to a shot of the same crater, where a number of Altean structures have been built. The comet has been removed, and in its place a small glowing gold hole is encased in a purple transparent dome with an observation deck built within it.
Zarkon says: "I've finished evacuating all Galra citizens near the crater."
Zarkon says: "What have you discovered?"
Alfor says: "We're not sure."
Alfor says: "This comet is like none seen before."
Alfor says: "It seems to be made of a material that can pass between realities."
Zarkon says: "What do you mean?"
Close-up of the comet piece.
Alfor says: "Well, I mean that sages have always theorized that there are many realities stacked side-by-side with each other."

Alfor says: "Her expertise will be invaluable."
Cut to Honerva.
Honerva says: "Isn't it exciting?"
Honerva says: "It could change the way we understand our entire universe!"
Zarkon says: "Well..."
Zarkon says: "find out everything you can."
Zarkon says: "I will provide any support you require."
Zarkon says: "I must go."

Alfor says: "How is our quintessence experiment?"
Honerva says: "Still running."
Overhead shot of Zarkon, Alfor, and Honerva, with a device to Honerva's right that is running at full power.
Alfor says: "Running for a full year on one drop of quintessence with no decline in revolutions per dobosh."
Alfor says: "No other energy source like this exists!"
Alfor says: "The ships I'm creating for us work on the same principle, and the ore from the comet practically engineers itself."
Alfor says: "It's..."
Alfor says: "frightening, in a way."
Zarkon says: "Endlessly powerful ships for the Galra empire!"
Alfor says: "And an endless source of clean energy for the entire system."
Zarkon says: "..."
Zarkon says: "Of course."
A strange purple and red creature shoots around the tube into the frame, catching Alfor's attention. Pan over to show the full jar, with a strange amoeba-like creature floating inside of it. Downward shot of Zarkon, Alfor, and Honerva with the tube in the foreground, floating and zipping around the tube.
Alfor says: "What is that?"

Honerva says: "Nothing from our universe has been able to survive the passage through the rift, but somehow, he arrived unharmed."
Honerva places her hand on the glass. Downward shot of Zarkon, Alfor, and Honerva.
Alfor says: "What?"
Alfor says: "I thought we discussed this; we must exercise caution."

Suddenly the screen floods with white light, and Voltron tumbles into view, floating in the quintessence field. Close-ups of Alfor, Gyrgan, Trigel, and Blaytz, groaning as they come to.
Blaytz says: "Where are we?"
Profile close-up of Alfor.
Alfor says: "We've entered the rift."
Alfor says: "No!"
Alfor says: "Zarkon!"
Alfor says: "What are you doing?!"
Alfor says: "!"
Medium shot of Zarkon, carrying Honerva bridal style and lifting her up to be fully exposed to the rift. Back shot of Alfor looking at his instrument panel.
Alfor says: "We have to get them out of here!"
Split screen to show Blaytz.
Blaytz says: "We must hurry."
Blaytz says: "The creatures have returned!"
Full shot of Zarkon and Honerva, who are quickly enveloped by the creatures. Back shot of Trigel in Green's cockpit as the creatures collide with her windows.
Trigel says: "They're everywhere!"

Alfor says: "Fire all lasers!"
Full shot of the creatures whirling around Voltron, which begins firing its lasers in every direction, eventually dispelling the creatures. Close-up of Trigel.
Alfor says: "Trigel, grab them!"
Alfor says: "Gyrgan!"
Alfor says: "Blaytz!"
Alfor says: "Fire your thrusters, we must leave!"
Upward shot of Voltron as the Blue and Yellow Lion's thrusters fire and lift Voltron up and out of the rift. Montage of Voltron kneeling outside the rift; Alfor, Trigel, Gyrgan, and Blaytz grieving over Zarkon and Honerva, whose hands are the only parts of them in frame; a wide shot of the now-enlarged rift and Voltron kneeling beside it; a shot of Daibazaal covered in glowing gold fissures as Galra cruisers evacuate the planet; the Red, Green, Yellow, and Blue Lions surrounding the planet, the center of which explodes, leaving behind only a fraction of what the planet used to be; a pan down of the entry to the Castle of Lions as people enter to pay their respects to Zarkon and Honerva; Zarkon and Honerva's funeral chamber aboard Zarkon's ship.
Coran says: "Zarkon's attempt to save Honerva was in vain."
Coran says: "They both succumbed to overexposure of quintessence."
Coran says: "The Paladins had been deceived by Zarkon."
Coran says: "They had unwittingly enlarged the rift, which further destabilized planet Daibazaal."
Coran says: "King Alfor was forced to evacuate the planet."
Coran says: "He then closed the rift the only way he knew howâ€”"
Coran says: "by destroying the Galran homeworld."
Coran says: "King Alfor held a state funeral for Zarkon and Honerva in his royal hall."
Coran says: "But what happened next, he could never have guessed."
Close-up of Zarkon as he sits up, the shroud falling from his face. He breathes out slowly, his voice sounding much deeper and more menacing. His eyes now glow purple and he turns to see Honerva's empty stretcher. Pan down from a full shot of Zarkon to the hooded figure crouched on the floor and shivering. Close-up of Honerva, her face purple and her marks running down over her mouth, her cloak over her head, fully transformed into the witch Haggar. Medium shot of a Galra soldier as the doors slide open behind him; he turns, startled, as the camera zooms out and Zarkon looms over him.
Zarkon says: "Where am I?"
Galra Soldier says: "Aboard your ship, sir."
Profile close-up of Zarkon.
Zarkon says: "Take us home."
Medium shot of the soldier.
Galra soldier says: "I-I..."
Galra soldier says: "can't, sir."
Galra soldier says: "Daibazaal..."
Montage as Zarkon makes an announcement to the Galra. Wide shot of a room on board a Galra ship as the soldiers turn to look at him, stunned; a crowd of what appears to be Galrans and Alteans watchingÂ  in horror; Upward shot of Trigel's people looking up at screens broadcasting the announcement in a city; and Zarkon, Gyrgan, Blaytz, and Trigel staring up, shocked and horrified, at a screen in the dining room.
Zarkon says: "My fellow Galra, King Alfor of Altea has destroyed our planet."
Zarkon says: "He must pay dearly for his crimes."
Zarkon says: "Rise up and join your emperor!"
Zarkon says: "Revenge will be ours!"
Montage of Zarkon seated on his throne, Haggar at his left side; Zarkon and Haggar looking up at a screen showing an image of Voltron and its data; Galra cruisers attacking a planet; Blaytz and Trigel watching Galra cruisers flying overhead as the world around them is lit aflame and a pan upward showing the multitudes of warships; a dissolve to a shot of space as pueple, green, blue, red, and yellow streaks of light indicate the five lions being sent away; a wide shot of Zarkon and Alfor on a bridge on Altea, Zarkon having struck the killing blow and Alfor collapsing; and the Castle of Lions flying through space as Altea explodes.
Coran says: "Zarkon had become pure evil, obsessed only with quintessence."
Coran says: "In order to open a new rift between the realities, he needed Voltron."
Coran says: "And so the war began."
Coran says: "The Galra immediately responded to their leader and attacked."
Coran says: "The peaceful planets of our system were not prepared."
Coran says: "Soon they had all fallen except for Altea."
Coran says: "In a final attempt to keep Voltron from Zarkon's hands, the Lions were sent to the far corners of the universe."
Coran says: "Zarkon flew into a rage."
Coran says: "He killed King Alfor, then avenged the loss of Daibazaal with the destruction of Altea."
Cut to the present in a shot of Keith, Lance, Shiro, Pidge, Allura, and Hunk over Coran's shoulder.
Pidge says: "So that's Lotor's planâ€”"
Pidge says: "to cross into other universes and get the purest quintessence possible!"
Keith says: "No matter what , we have to stop him."
Cut to an over-the-shoulder shot of the room where Haggar is tending to Zarkon. A small shockwave fills the room and Haggar is thrown backward, panting. Close-up of Haggar.
Haggar says: "Husband..."
Haggar says: "how could I have forgotten?"
Haggar says: "You brought me back to life long ago."
Haggar says: "Now..."
Haggar says: "come back for me."
Extreme close-up and zoom in on Zarkon's face as his eyes open, purple, glowing, and very much alive.
