SHIRO says: ""Pidge, scan the download from the ship."
SHIRO says: "Find out where Zarkon's central command is."
PIDGE says: ""On it!"
CORAN says: ""Coran: What happened?"
CORAN says: "Where's Allura?"
SHIRO says: ""They captured her."
SHIRO says: "She sacrificed herself to save me and the information."
SHIRO says: "I didn't have a choice."
CORAN says: ""How is that possible?"
SHIRO says: ""Coran, I'm sorry things didn't go as planned, but we can't focus on what went wrong."
SHIRO says: "We've got to figure out how to make it right."
SHIRO says: "Pidge, anything?"
PIDGE says: ""Guys, look at this."
CORAN says: ""Coran: Look at the size of it!"
PIDGE says: ""I think we should go in right away."
PIDGE says: "Every minute we waste gives Zarkon time to prepare for us."
LANCE says: ""I agree."
LANCE says: "We form Voltron, fly in, fly out, dust off our hands, and walk away."
HUNK says: ""Um, do you guys not remember the Balmera?"
HUNK says: "We could barely take out one fleet."
HUNK says: "But this..."
HUNK says: "a base this size could hold a thousand fleets!"
KEITH says: ""Or maybe we shouldn't go on this mission at all."
KEITH says: "Think about it."
KEITH says: "We'll be delivering the universe's only hope to the universe's biggest enemy."
HUNK says: ""Keith, that's cold, even for you."
HUNK says: "What if it was one of us?"
HUNK says: "What if it was me?"
HUNK says: "You wouldn't leave me, would you?"
HUNK says: "Would you?"
KEITH says: ""I'm not saying I like the idea."
KEITH says: "I'm just thinking like a paladin."
LANCE says: ""No, you're thinking of yourself because you're too scared to do what's right!"
PIDGE says: ""Okay, we're all upset because we lost Allura."
CORAN says: ""No, Shiro lost Allura!"
HUNK says: ""Okay, okay!"
HUNK says: "This isn't helping."
HUNK says: "We can't just sit here and bicker like this."
SHIRO says: ""Let's focus."
SHIRO says: "How are we going to get Allura?"
In the Galra Empire.
HAGGAR says: ""Come with me."
Returning back to the Paladins.
SHIRO says: ""Anything?"
LANCE says: ""There's just no way in."
LANCE says: "They'll have us tracked from every direction."
SHIRO says: ""There's gotta be something."
SHIRO says: "Keep looking."
SHIRO says: ""I know you're worried about her."
SHIRO says: "We all are."
SHIRO says: "I'm sorry I let her slip away."
CORAN says: ""I know it's not your fault."
CORAN says: "It's just..."
CORAN says: "I've already lost so much."
CORAN says: "I can't lose Allura, too."
SHIRO says: ""We'll find a way to get her back."
SHIRO says: "If there was just a way to get close to Zarkon's ship unseen..."
CORAN says: ""Wait a tick."
CORAN says: "I think I've got a way."
ZARKON says: ""Princess Allura."
ALLURA says: ""You monster!"
ALLURA says: "You destroyed Altea!"
ALLURA says: ""Voltron is going to put an end to your empire!"
ZARKON says: ""No, it will only make me more powerful."
ZARKON says: "Your father knew that as well as I."
ZARKON says: "That's why he led me to believe he destroyed it all those years ago."
ZARKON says: "But now, your new paladins will come for you, and they will deliver Voltron to me, and, with it, the key to unimaginable power."
SHIRO says: ""Everyone, eyes front."
SHIRO says: "We've got a plan to get Allura."
SHIRO says: "We're going to jump to the heart of the enemy, unseen and undetected."
PIDGE says: ""I thought we needed Allura to open up a wormhole."
CORAN says: ""It's true that Allura powers the Castle's ability to travel through wormholes."
CORAN says: "However, I think we have enough of her residual essence stored in the system to make one jump."
CORAN says: "We'll hide the Castle here, inside one of these giant gas planets in Zarkon's command system."
CORAN says: "The gas is so dense, we'll be hidden."
SHIRO says: ""From there, we'll use the Castle to scan for Allura on Zarkon's ship and attack before Zarkon knows what hit him."
CORAN says: ""There's only one hiccup."
CORAN says: "We have enough energy to wormhole in, but, without Allura, we won't have enough energy to wormhole out."
SHIRO says: ""It doesn't matter."
SHIRO says: "We're not leaving without her."
PROROK says: ""Prorok: Sire, allow me to send my fleet to protect the command system."
PROROK says: "I will stop Voltron before it can get close."
ZARKON says: ""You will do no such thing, Prorok."
ZARKON says: "We will allow them inside our perimeter."
HAGGAR says: ""Once in, they won't get out."
ZARKON says: ""Zarkon: Ready all fleets."
ZARKON says: "On this day, the paladins will be destroyed, and I will have Voltron."
SHIRO says: ""We're here."
CORAN says: ""Coran: I'm detecting Allura's energy signature."
CORAN says: "From this distance, the signal's pretty weak, but she's somewhere in Zarkon's main ship."
KEITH says: ""Gives us a starting point."
CORAN says: ""Once we get closer, we'll be able to narrow down the location where the Princess is being held."
SHIRO says: ""Okay, guys, this is it."
SHIRO says: "Voltron is going to come in fast and without warning."
SHIRO says: "We'll smash our way into Zarkon's ship and grab the Princess."
SHIRO says: "Before they know what hit them, we'll have the Princess and be on our way."
PROROK says: ""Prorok: Emperor, we're detecting Voltron within our perimeter!"
ZARKON says: ""Engage the solar barrier immediately."
ZARKON says: "Attack!"
PROROK says: ""Yes, Emperor."
PROROK says: ""Thace, scramble the fighters!"
THACE says: ""Yes, Commander."
ZARKON says: ""Haggar, it is time."
HUNK says: ""What is that?"
PIDGE says: ""Pidge: I don't know, but I hope once we get the Princess, we can find a way out of here."
PIDGE says: ""They're going to fire!"
SHIRO says: ""Form sword!"
LANCE says: ""Lance: More trouble, straight ahead!"
SHIRO says: ""Form shoulder cannon!"
SHIRO says: ""Shiro: There's Zarkon's ship!"
HUNK says: ""Hunk: What's going on?"
KEITH says: ""Keith: We lost the sword!"
KEITH says: "Something's malfunctioning!"
CORAN says: ""What's happening?"
LANCE says: ""Somebody do something!"
LANCE says: "Voltron's frozen up!"
KEITH says: ""Shiro!"
KEITH says: "I can't hold it!"
ZARKON says: ""You're a fool to bring Voltron here."
HUNK says: ""What just happened there?"
HUNK says: "Something tore us apart!"
LANCE says: ""I don't know, but we've got bigger problems right now."
LANCE says: "Look!"
KEITH says: ""Why do I get the feeling these guys knew we were coming?"
HUNK says: ""Ah, There's no end to these guys!"
CORAN says: ""Coran attack!"
CORAN says: "I've waited ten thousand years for this!"
Shiro groans.
KEITH says: ""Shiro, are you okay?"
SHIRO says: ""Something is overriding the controls!"
SHIRO says: "My Lion is not responding!"
KEITH says: ""Shiro's in trouble!"
KEITH says: "I'm going in!"
ZARKON says: "" You cannot fight it."
ZARKON says: "Your connection is weak."
HUNK says: ""What do we do now, guys?"
HUNK says: "Our plan isn't really working out as..."
HUNK says: "well, planned!"
KEITH says: ""I'm going for the Black Lion."
KEITH says: "You guys get the Princess, now!"
CORAN says: ""I've identified Allura's exact location."
CORAN says: "Uploading the coordinates to you, now."
CORAN says: "In the meantime, I'll provide covering fire from out here, all alone, against an entire fleet."
CORAN says: "So, yeah, do you mind hurrying?"
SHIRO says: ""My jetpack's damaged."
SHIRO says: "I'll need to go through the ship."
KEITH says: ""You guys get the Princess without me."
LANCE says: ""What?"
LANCE says: "We've got to stick together!"
LANCE says: "What are you doing?"
KEITH says: ""Whatever I can."
KEITH says: ""Whoa!"
KEITH says: "Who is that?"
CORAN says: "" It's Zarkon!"
CORAN says: "Keith, get out of there, now!"
CORAN says: "Zarkon's too powerful!"
KEITH says: ""This is my chance to put an end to the Galra Empire!"
KEITH says: "I have to take it!"
CORAN says: ""Keith, don't!"
ZARKON says: ""You may have a Lion, but its power is weak in your fledgling hands."
ZARKON says: ""You cannot stop me."
ZARKON says: "The Black Lion will finally be returned to its original paladin."
HAGGAR says: ""So, Champion returns."
SHIRO says: ""You.."
Haggar laughs.
HUNK says: ""This is it!"
HUNK says: "The Princess is in this part of the ship!"
LANCE says: ""How do we get in?"
PIDGE says: ""Maybe I can try hacking one of their cargo bays."
HUNK says: ""We don't have time for that!"
PIDGE says: ""Do you have a better idea?"
HUNK says: ""Actually, yes, I do."
ALLURA says: ""Huh?"
THACE says: ""Sir, the hull's been breached."
THACE says: "It's one of the Lions."
PROROK says: ""Focus fighters on that quadrant."
LANCE says: ""Looks like we've got to cover Hunk's butt!"
ALLURA says: ""Hunk!"
HUNK says: ""We're going to get you out of here."
ALLURA says: ""What are you doing here?"
ALLURA says: "Tell me you didn't bring Voltron straight to Zarkon's central command!"
ALLURA says: "Where's the Black Lion?"
Shiro groans.
ALLURA says: ""We have to save Shiro!"
LANCE says: ""Hunk, did you get the Princess?"
HUNK says: ""I got her, but there's a change of plans."
HAGGAR says: ""I made you strong and this is how you repay me?"
HAGGAR says: ""You could have been our greatest weapon."
HAGGAR says: ""Now, I will destroy you."
Mean while, Keith continues his battle with Zarkon.
CORAN says: ""Keith, get out of there!"
Alarms blare.
CORAN says: ""Keith, do you copy?"
CORAN says: "You don't know what you're dealing with!"
CORAN says: "He's too powerful!"
CORAN says: "Listen to me, it's imperative that you don't engage the..."
Keith turns off the communicator.
KEITH says: ""No!"
Keith activates plasma cannon that throws off Zarkon's balance.
KEITH says: ""Whoa!"
ZARKON says: ""You fight like a Galra soldier."
ZARKON says: "But not for long!"
Zarkon goes for ending Keith, mean while, Haggar tries to destroy Shiro for once and for all.
HAGGAR says: ""And now, Champion, your time is over."
HUNK says: ""Which one's the real one?"
Haggar's laughter continues.
ALLURA says: ""Hunk, there!"
ALLURA says: "Fire!"
ALLURA says: ""We've got to get out of here!"
HUNK says: ""Where's the scary lady?"
ALLURA says: ""Hunk!"
HUNK says: ""Oh, right."
KEITH says: ""Come on!"
KEITH says: "Come on!"
Black Lion swoops in and carries the Red Lion to the Castle.
SHIRO says: ""I got you, buddy!"
ALLURA says: ""All right, Paladins, time to get out of here!"
HUNK says: ""Hello?"
HUNK says: "What's going on?"
HUNK says: "I don't see a wormhole."
CORAN says: ""The Galra barrier is jamming our ability to create one!"
PROROK says: ""Send in everything we've got!"
PROROK says: "Corner them!"
GALRA DRONE says: ""This sector is off limits."
CORAN says: ""They have us completely surrounded!"
PIDGE says: ""What just happened?"
HUNK says: ""Who cares?"
HUNK says: "Wormhole!"
SHIRO says: ""Coran, what's happening?"
CORAN says: ""The integrity of the wormhole has been compromised."
CORAN says: "It's breaking down!"
LANCE says: ""What does that mean?"
CORAN says: ""It means we have no control over where we're headed!"
Everyone screams and groan while being scattered apart from one another.
Episode ends.
