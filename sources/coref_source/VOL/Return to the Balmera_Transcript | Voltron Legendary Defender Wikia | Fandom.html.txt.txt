ALLURA says: ""We'll be arriving at the Balmera soon."
ALLURA says: "Liberating these Balmerans from Zarkon's grasp will not be easy."
LANCE says: ""So, what's the plan?"
LANCE says: "We go in there and just—"
LANCE says: "Pow, pow, pow!"
LANCE imitates laser fire.
LANCE says: ""—"
LANCE says: "And free the prisoners?"
KEITH says: ""What was that noise?"
LANCE says: ""Laser guns."
HUNK says: ""No, Lance, I think you mean—"
HUNK imitates a huge laser cannon.
HUNK says: ""—"
HUNK says: "Pow!"
LANCE says: ""That sounds like fireworks."
PIDGE says: ""Technically, they're more like—"
PIDGE says: "ba-choo, ba-choo, ba-choo!"
PIDGE imitates firing a small laser gun.
SHIRO says: ""Okay, enough with the bad sound effects."
SHIRO says: "..."
SHIRO says: "Besides, it's more like—"
SHIRO says: "blam, blam, blam!"
SHIRO dramatically imitates firing a laser gun.
KEITH says: ""What?"
PIDGE says: ""You're crazy."
LANCE says: ""No way."
HUNK says: ""Nuh—"
HUNK says: "Wrong."
ALLURA says: ""Paladins, focus."
HUNK says: ""Besides, we can't just shoot at the Galra."
HUNK says: "This Balmera, it's, like, alive."
HUNK says: "And from what we've seen, it doesn't look very good."
CORAN says: ""Yes, it's an atrocity what the Galra have been doing to this grand beast."
CORAN says: "Stealing its Crystals, its very life force, without ever performing the energy rejuvenation ceremonies to heal it."
HUNK says: ""After seeing Shay's people enslaved, it made me realize how bad Zarkon really is."
HUNK says: "And we're the only ones who can stop him."
SHIRO says: ""Okay, so we can't go into the tunnels guns blazing."
SHIRO says: "Plan B."
SHIRO says: "We figure out how to draw the Galra up to the surface and battle them out there."
HUNK says: ""Wait, I know!"
HUNK says: "If we attack all of this big mining stuff on the surface, the Galra troops will have to come out to defend it."
HUNK says: "Then we beat them up, head down to the tunnels, Voltron saves the day."
A cartoon image of HUNK's plan appears.
SHIRO says: ""But how will we know how many are left down in the tunnels?"
ALLURA says: ""We can track the Galra and the Balmerans using Biothermal Life Indicator Point Technology."
ALLURA brings up a hologram of a BLIP drone.
PIDGE says: ""Oh, BLIP tech!"
ALLURA does not understand and stares at PIDGE silently.
PIDGE says: ""..."
PIDGE says: "It's an acronym?"
ALLURA says: ""One of you will need to fly around the Balmera and drop sensors into the shafts on each side."
The hologram imitates the plan.
ALLURA says: ""Then we'll be able to see where the Galra and the Balmerans are."
ALLURA says: "There are already sensors built into your suits."
PIDGE says: ""I can do it."
PIDGE says: "I just modified the Green Lion with the invisible maze's cloaking ability."
PIDGE says: "I should be able to fly around unnoticed."
CORAN brings up an image of the Balmera's surface on screen.
CORAN says: ""That's their main power generator."
CORAN says: "If you take that down, it will severely weaken their defenses."
ALLURA says: ""We'll stay in cloud cover and give tactical support."
ALLURA says: "With the Castle's defenses weakened from Sendak's Crystal, we won't be of much help to you."
SHIRO says: ""I'll take out the power generator."
SHIRO says: "Keith, Lance, Hunk, you take out these big mining rigs around the area."
HUNK says: ""Yeah!"
HUNK says: "Okay, let's do this!"
HUNK says: "Let's go kick some alien butt!"
Fire and Ice.
The Paladins prepare to launch.
LANCE says: ""You think the Balmerans will have a parade for us after we've freed everybody?"
KEITH sends a video transmission to LANCE.
KEITH says: ""It's not about the glory, Lance."
KEITH says: "It's about freeing prisoners from Zarkon."
LANCE says: ""No, I know."
LANCE says: "I know."
LANCE says: "But still."
LANCE says: "When they—"
The Blue Lion launches from the Castleship, jolting LANCE. The Lions fly towards the Balmera's surface; the Galra structures start firing lasers.
SHIRO says: ""This is it."
SHIRO says: "Get your heads in the game."
SHIRO says: "Remember, the Balmera is a living creature."
SHIRO says: "Make sure you pinpoint only the Galra installations and not its surface."
PIDGE says: ""Initiating cloak."
The Green Lion separates from the group and turns invisible to drop BLIP drones. LANCE and HUNK destroy Galra weapons.
SHIRO says: ""How do I take this thing down?"
The Black Lion displays its Jaw Blade on the screen of the cockpit.
SHIRO says: ""What's that?"
SHIRO says: "Jaw blade?"
SHIRO says: "Okay!"
SHIRO says: "Let's do this!"
SHIRO uses the Black Lion's jaw blade to destroy the power generator. PIDGE finishes dropping BLIP drones.
PIDGE says: ""All sensors delivered."
A holographic map of the Balmera and all living lifeforms on it appears in the Castle of Lions. The power generator still has an active and massive laser cannon attacking the Red Lion. After dodging, the Red Lion fires its heat ray to melt through the cannon's tower.
KEITH says: ""Whoa!"
KEITH says: "Did you guys just see that?"
KEITH says: "I got fire power!"
LANCE says: ""Hey!"
LANCE says: "I want that!"
The cannon tower begins to fall towards the Balmera's surface.
KEITH says: ""Oh, no!"
HUNK says: ""Hey, we can't let this thing hurt the Balmera!"
HUNK struggles to hold the tower upright with the Yellow Lion.
LANCE says: ""I think my Lion knows what to do!"
LANCE uses the Blue Lion's freeze ray to freeze the tower in place.
LANCE says: ""Ha-Aw, snap!"
LANCE says: "These rays are super cool, just like me!"
SHIRO says: ""Great job, team!"
The Paladins wait for troops from the Galra Empire to appear. Nothing happens.
KEITH says: ""Where are all the troops?"
KEITH says: "They're not coming to the surface."
HUNK sends KEITH a video transmission.
HUNK says: ""Yeah, I remember seeing a lot of Galra guys down in the mines."
ALLURA is looking at a map of the Balmera and radios to the Paladins.
ALLURA says: ""We've located a hangar full of Galra fighters just below the surface."
ALLURA says: "Someone has to take those out before they can launch."
SHIRO says: ""They're luring us down, but we have no choice."
SHIRO says: "Keith, Lance, you guys hit the hangar."
SHIRO says: "Hunk, head to the prison to rescue Shay and the other Balmerans."
SHIRO says: "Pidge and I will track down the Galra soldiers."
KEITH says: ""Yes, sir!"
LANCE says: ""Ten-four!"
PIDGE says: ""On it!"
HUNK says: ""Let's do this!"
The Lions fly off.
A Trap.
THACE approaches PROROK at ZARKON's Central Command System.
THACE says: ""Commander Prorok, we have word from the troops on Balmera X-95 Vox."
THACE says: "The informants were right."
THACE says: "Voltron is there."
PROROK says: ""Excellent."
PROROK says: "Everything is going according to plan."
THACE says: ""How do you wish to proceed?"
THACE says: "Should we inform Emperor Zarkon?"
PROROK says: ""Contact Subcommander Ylvik."
PROROK says: "His fleet is awaiting my command."
PROROK says: "Tell him it's time to attack."
PROROK says: "I will update the Emperor."
Underground.
The Hangar.
The Paladins drop their Lions at the bottom of mine shafts and navigate the tunnels with their speeders. KEITH and LANCE scope out the Galra hangar.
KEITH says: ""The entire hangar's only being guarded by a few Sentries."
KEITH readies his Bayard and prepares to attack.
KEITH says: ""Let's go!"
LANCE grabs KEITH and pulls him back.
LANCE says: ""Whoa, w-w-whoa, whoa!"
LANCE says: "Cool your jets, Keith!"
LANCE says: "Don't you remember all that stuff about this Balmera thing being a sensitive animal?"
KEITH says: ""Oh."
KEITH says: "Right."
LANCE says: ""Yeah, so we can't just blow things up like a psycho."
KEITH says: ""Oh, You got a better idea?"
LANCE says: ""I do."
LANCE says: "We sneak into the control room to shut down the bay doors."
LANCE says: "That'll trap the ships in."
KEITH says: ""That—"
KEITH says: "!"
KEITH says: "..."
KEITH says: "Actually..."
KEITH says: "is a better idea."
KEITH and LANCE start sneaking towards the hangar's control room. The Castleship is tracking everyone's movements. HUNK is in his speeder traversing the mine tunnels.
HUNK says: ""Allura, Coran, w-what's my location?"
HUNK says: "All these tunnels look the same."
HUNK says: "I can't remember where the prison is."
CORAN says: ""You're on the right path."
CORAN says: "Turn right at the next tunnel."
CORAN says: "Once you get there, you'll have to disable the energy doors."
CORAN says: "Be careful."
CORAN says: "It looks like it's heavily guarded."
KEITH and LANCE are breaking in to the control room of the hangar from above. A Sentry stands at the controls.
LANCE says: ""No, no."
LANCE says: "It's over here."
KEITH says: ""I know what I'm doing."
KEITH uses his Bayard katar to slice a hole in the ceiling above the Sentry. LANCE kicks the hole open, crushing the Sentry underneath its weight. Both Paladins enter the control room.
LANCE says: ""Keep an eye out for those guards."
LANCE says: "I'll see if I can find a way to shut the hangar doors."
KEITH nods and stands watch. LANCE inspects the computer console.
LANCE says: ""Uh..."
LANCE says: "Hmm."
LANCE says: "Nope."
LANCE says: "Maybe."
LANCE says: "Uh..."
LANCE says: "Uh..."
LANCE says: "Mm..."
LANCE presses buttons to no avail.
LANCE says: ""Ah, I don't know what I'm doing here."
LANCE says: "It's all Galra gibberish."
KEITH says: ""Let me see."
KEITH inspects the console and then puts his hand on the hand print, activating the bay doors and closing them.
LANCE says: ""Whoa!"
LANCE says: "How'd you do that?"
KEITH says: ""I just put my hand on the hand print."
The Tunnels.
HUNK approaches the prison in his speeder. Galra Sentries are fleeing, but some fire at him. HUNK exits his speeder and blasts the Sentries with his Bayard cannon.
HUNK says: ""That was way too easy."
HUNK says: "I definitely don't have a good feeling about this."
HUNK uses a broken Sentry hand to unlock the prison doors and enter. He finds SHAY'S family, but not SHAY.
SHAY'S FATHER says: ""Hunk, you have returned!"
SHAY's family greets HUNK, sans RAX, who sits aside.
HUNK says: ""I promised I'd be back."
HUNK says: "We're here to help."
HUNK says: "Where's Shay?"
RAX says: ""Our life may not have been perfect, but our family was whole."
RAX says: "Your arrival has left us imprisoned and torn apart."
RAX says: "As soon as your attack started, they took her away to the core of the Balmera."
RAX says: "For all we know, she could be gone for good."
ALLURA notices strange movement by the Galra on the Castleship's map.
ALLURA says: ""Paladins, are you there?"
ALLURA says: "The Galra troops are moving down the tunnels."
ALLURA says: "It looks like they're going down toward the center."
HUNK says: ""They must be headed to the core of the Balmera."
HUNK says: "That's where they're holding Shay."
HUNK rushes off to the Balmera's core. SHIRO is still in his speeder.
SHIRO says: ""They're drawing us into an ambush, but we don't have a choice if we want to save Shay."
SHIRO says: "We have to follow."
SHIRO says: "Lance, Keith, get to the core."
SHIRO says: "I think we're going to need everyone together to get through this firefight."
LANCE and KEITH are still in the control room. The bay doors finish shutting.
LANCE says: ""Copy that."
LANCE says: "We're on our way."
KEITH damages the computer console; LANCE damages the lock to the door so no one can access it. Both leave. PIDGE is in her speeder, but the tunnel becomes too narrow. ALLURA speaks to PIDGE over their communication channel.
ALLURA says: ""Looks like you're in an area where the tunnels are too narrow for your speeder."
PIDGE says: ""Yeah."
PIDGE says: "Proceeding on foot."
PIDGE enters the narrow tunnel and sees shadows approaching.
PIDGE says: ""There's someone here."
ALLURA says: ""Looking into it."
The shadows come closer; PIDGE summons her Bayard and rushes to attack.
ALLURA says: ""Pidge, no!"
ALLURA says: "Those are Balmerans!"
PIDGE stops when she sees Balmeran children.
PIDGE says: ""Phew!"
PIDGE greets the children, but the Balmera groans and trembles, so the Balmeran children run in fear. One child trips and is nearly crushed by falling rock. PIDGE saves them.
PIDGE says: ""Don't worry."
PIDGE speaks to the other Paladins through the communication channel.
PIDGE says: ""Hey, team, be careful."
PIDGE says: "The Balmera is very unstable."
LANCE and KEITH immediately run into a squadron of Galra Sentries that bombard them with laser fire.
KEITH says: ""Their shooting is destroying the Balmera."
KEITH says: "We gotta do something!"
The Balmera is crying in pain.
LANCE says: ""Well, we can't shoot back!"
LANCE says: "It'll just make it worse."
LANCE looks around and devises a plan, trying to direct KEITH with motions instead of words.
KEITH says: ""Huh?"
KEITH does not understand at all, but looks around and figures out what LANCE intends. KEITH climbs a latter to sneak above the Sentries. LANCE jumps out in front of them and waves his arms.
LANCE says: ""Na-na Na-na boo-boo!"
LANCE defends himself with his shield as the Sentries fire at him. KEITH jumps down from above and attack the Sentries, destroying them. LANCE gives KEITH a thumbs-up.
Caught.
HUNK runs to the core of the Balmera and finds no one there but SHAY, muzzled and hanging from the ceiling.
HUNK says: ""Shay!"
HUNK says: "You're alive!"
HUNK shoots SHAY free and catches her as she falls. SHIRO and PIDGE arrive.
SHIRO says: ""Where are the Galra?"
SHIRO says: "If this is an ambush, they should be here waiting for us."
KEITH and LANCE arrive; the doors to the core suddenly all shut.
HUNK says: ""Not an ambush."
HUNK says: "More like a trap."
KEITH says: ""Whatever it is, keep your guard up."
SHAY says: ""The Galra, they gained knowledge that you would return to the Balmera."
PIDGE says: ""How?"
SHAY says: ""I know not."
SHAY says: "But they set this trap just for you."
SHAY says: "I was the bait."
SHIRO says: ""Who could have possibly known that we were heading here to save Shay?"
HUNK says: ""Rolo!"
HUNK says: "Those liars must have told Zarkon."
SHIRO says: ""We have to figure out how to get out of here."
LANCE says: ""Wait!"
LANCE says: "We have a giant Castleship hovering in the sky."
LANCE says: "Allura, can you please come get us?"
KEITH says: ""How do you expect her to do that, genius?"
LANCE says: ""I don't know, maybe they got teleporters or something."
ALLURA and CORAN are on the Castleship under attack.
ALLURA says: ""We're quite occupied at the moment."
ALLURA says: "We're completely surrounded by Galra ships and we're taking heavy fire!"
CORAN says: ""Princess, our particle barrier won't last much longer!"
ALLURA says: ""Paladins, you need to get out of there as soon as you can!"
In the core of the Balmera, LANCE looks dejected.
LANCE says: ""This is it!"
LANCE says: "We're going to die in here."
LANCE says: "I can say bye-bye to that parade."
No one is impressed.
SHIRO says: ""Get it together, guys."
SHIRO says: "Allura, we'll get there as soon as we can."
SHAY says: ""Perhaps my people can help us get out."
SHAY places her hand on the Balmera's core.
SHAY says: ""This is how we communicate."
SHAY says: "The Balmera senses our vibrations and sends a message to those in the tunnels."
KEITH says: ""Are you sure someone will be able to hear your..."
KEITH says: "hand from all the way down here?"
SHAY says: ""The Balmera will deliver the message."
SHAY focuses and the area around her hand glows. The Balmera groans as it sends the message to RAX and their family. RAX places his hand on the ground and it glows.
RAX says: ""It's a message from Shay."
SHAY'S FATHER says: ""She's alive!"
RAX says: ""The Paladins of Voltron went to the core of the Balmera to save Shay..."
RAX says: "and now they are all trapped."
SHAY'S FATHER says: ""Then we are all doomed."
RAX says: ""This is all my fault."
RAX says: "I conspired against them, and because of my actions, Shay was imprisoned."
RAX says: "The big yellow one was right."
RAX says: "If we ever hope to be free, we must take action."
SHAY'S FATHER says: ""But how can we rise up against our Galra overlords?"
RAX says: ""What choice do we have?"
RAX says: "They have stolen all of the Crystals from our Balmera."
RAX says: "Our lives are worthless to them now."
SHAY'S FATHER says: ""But Balmerans have never fought."
RAX says: ""You taught me that without family, we have nothing."
RAX says: "The Galra have taken Shay."
RAX says: "How can we do nothing while the Paladins sacrifice everything to save us?"
RAX says: "We must do our part!"
To the Skies.
Glory and Power.
PROROK kneels before ZARKON on the Emperor's Command Ship.
PROROK says: ""Prorok: Lord Zarkon, I have news to report."
PROROK says: "News that will likely please you, my Emperor."
ZARKON says: ""Proceed."
PROROK says: ""I have the Voltron Paladins trapped on a Balmera in the Javeeno star system."
PROROK says: "I've ordered a fleet to capture the Lions and destroy the Altean Castle."
ZARKON says: ""You fool!"
ZARKON says: "You dare make plans without informing me?"
PROROK says: ""Forgive me, Emperor..."
PROROK says: "but I saw an opportunity and I took it for the glory of the Galra Empire."
ZARKON says: ""I suspect that you are seeking your own glory, Prorok."
ZARKON says: "But you do not realize Voltron's power."
Desperation.
At the Balmera, A fleet of Galra fighter jets splits off from the ones attacking the Castle of Lions.
CORAN says: ""They're heading down into the tunnels!"
CORAN says: "They're going to steal the Lions!"
ALLURA says: ""Paladins, the Lions are in danger!"
ALLURA says: "You must get back to them immediately!"
CORAN says: ""Princess, something's locked onto us."
A Galra warship suddenly appears.
ALLURA says: ""Paladins, do you copy?"
ALLURA says: "There's a battle cruiser locked onto us."
ALLURA says: "If it fires with its ion cannon, I don't know if we can survive."
LANCE says: ""We're trying, Allura."
LANCE says: "Shay's pressing her hand against the wall, which apparently sends vibrations to the other rock people, who vibrate back or something?"
LANCE says: "Hand talking?"
LANCE says: "I guess the answer to your question is, 'Yes, we copy."
SHIRO says: ""Shay, are you sure the Balmera is sending your message?"
SHAY focuses harder. Her family stands outside a doorway to the core and uses their hands to instruct the Balmera into crushing the doorway open. RAX and his family enter the core of the Balmera.
SHAY says: ""Rax!"
RAX says: ""We must make haste."
RAX says: "We know a shortcut through the tunnels."
SHIRO says: ""Allura, stand by."
SHIRO says: "We're on our way up."
Victory.
Two fighter jets are using tracer beams to raise the Black Lion. ALLURA speaks over the communication channel.
ALLURA says: "Paladins, hurry!"
ALLURA says: "They're taking off with the Lions!"
SHIRO launches his speeder towards the Black Lion, slipping through a hole in its force field to take control and free the Lion from the Galra.
SHIRO says: ""Guys, did everyone make it to the Lions in time?"
LANCE says: ""Come on, Shiro."
LANCE says: "Who you think you're dealing with, a bunch of amateurs—"
LANCE is not paying attention so the Blue Lion runs into a mining structure.
SHIRO says: ""Do you really want me to answer that?"
LANCE says: ""No."
SHIRO says: ""Let's go!"
The Paladins fly their Lions at the large fleet of Galra fighter jets and engage in battle.
PIDGE says: ""Hunk, watch out!"
PIDGE shields the Yellow Lion from laser fire with the Green Lion's back shield.
Shiro says: ""Got you covered!"
SHIRO uses the Black Lion's jaw blade to destroy the fighter jets.
HUNK says: ""Phew!"
HUNK says: "Thanks, guys!"
Up above, the Galra warship prepares to fire.
CORAN says: ""It's charging its ion cannon!"
ALLURA says: ""Divert all shields to the bow."
The Castle of Lions focuses its particle barrier to take the brunt of the assault and struggles to survive the blast form the ion cannon.
ALLURA says: ""Paladins, I need you immediately!"
ALLURA says: "Five more ticks and we're finished!"
SHIRO says: ""Okay, team, let's form Voltron!"
PALADINS says: ""Yeah!"
The Paladins form Voltron and slam into the Galra warship, diverting its cannon from the Castle of Lions.
CORAN says: ""Right now is our chance, Princess!"
ALLURA says: ""Full power on the blasters!"
ALLURA says: "Locked onto target."
ALLURA says: "Fire!"
The Castle of Lions blasts the Galra warship through, causing it to explode and destroy all surrounding fighter jets.
HUNK says: ""Yeah!"
KEITH says: ""Yeah!"
PIDGE says: ""Nice shot, Princess!"
LANCE says: ""Yeah!"
LANCE says: "The parade's back on."
Unending Threat.
PROROK still kneels before ZARKON in the throne room of the Emperor's Command Ship. A Galra soldier speaks over the intercomm.
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""The Galra fleet and all Sentries on the Balmera have been defeated!"
PROROK says: ""No!"
PROROK says: "How could this be?"
PROROK says: "Lord Zarkon, I will do all that I can to recapture Voltron for the Galra!"
ZARKON says: ""Silence, Prorok."
ZARKON says: "I have plans that you cannot comprehend."
Meanwhile, Voltron lands on the Balmera. The Castle of Lions descends towards the surface.
KEITH says: ""Mission accomplished."
ALLURA says: ""And just in the tick of time."
ALLURA says: "The Castle's defenses are battered and will need to fully recharge."
The Castle alarms start blaring.
CORAN says: ""There's an unknown object incoming!"
CORAN says: "It's about to crash into the Balmera!"
A transport ship carrying the Robeast Drazil crashes into the Balmera.
LANCE says: ""What the heck is that?"
SHIRO says: ""..."
SHIRO says: "Trouble."
Episode ends with the Paladins waiting for Drazil to awaken from its ship.
