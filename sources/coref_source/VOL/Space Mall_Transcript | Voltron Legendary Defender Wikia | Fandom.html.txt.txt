SHIRO says: ""Okay, look."
SHIRO says: "I now know for certain that Zarkon is tracking us through the Black Lion."
SHIRO says: "We have to find some way to stop him."
PIDGE says: ""How are we gonna do that?"
ALLURA says: ""We've never had this situation before."
ALLURA says: "Two paladins battling for the same lion."
SHIRO says: ""Well, unless we want Zarkon taking control of Voltron every time we get close."
SHIRO says: "I'll have to forge a new bond with my lion."
SHIRO says: "One that's stronger than his."
CORAN says: ""Well, while you're working on that, the rest of us need to find some new teludav lenses otherwise we won't be able to travel via wormhole."
HUNK says: ""Is that something we have to mail order?"
KEITH says: ""Does anyone even make those anymore?"
ALLURA says: ""I don't know."
ALLURA says: "Only a few Alteans could use the teludav 10,000 ago."
ALLURA says: "They may not exist anymore."
CORAN says: ""I think I may know where we can get some."
ALLURA says: ""Coran!"
ALLURA says: "You're not suggesting going to one of those filthy swap moons!"
ALLURA says: "The last time you went, those space pirates took you for everything you had."
LANCE says: ""Space pirates?"
CORAN says: ""The Unilu were traders and pirates that roamed the galaxies and dealt in black market goods."
CORAN says: "Umvy spice, by-tor water, little bottles of infinity vapor."
CORAN says: "Of course, you had to bargain."
CORAN says: "No one could bargain like the Unilu."
CORAN says: "Last time, I ended up giving away three quarters of my shipment of lango in exchange for a used pogo oscillator."
ALLURA says: ""Father was not pleased about that."
LANCE says: ""Well, while Coran is picking up his lenses I'll take you shopping for something sparkly."
CORAN says: ""This isn't shopping!"
CORAN says: "You're not wandering around saying "Oooo What a lovely pink hat!"
CORAN says: "This is so becoming."
CORAN says: "" No!"
CORAN says: "I can't allow Allura to get anywhere near those filthy, lowballing Unilu hoodlums."
ALLURA says: ""But I'd love something sparkly."
CORAN says: ""Look, you're the only one who can operate the Castle."
CORAN says: "You need to be resting, after all you've been through."
CORAN says: "Now, let's ready a pod for our mission."
CORAN says: "We need to get in find the scaultrite lenses, and just get out."
LANCE says: ""Shotgun!"
HUNK says: ""What?"
HUNK says: "No, you have to be in the pod bay to call shotgun."
LANCE says: ""Since when?"
HUNK says: ""Uhh since forever?"
HUNK says: "That's shotgun etiquette!"
HUNK says: "I wrote the book."
SHIRO says: ""While they're doing that, I'm going to head down to the hangar."
SHIRO says: "I need to strengthen my bond with the Black Lion."
ALLURA says: ""Huh?"
ALLURA says: "So what am I supposed to do now, sit around and worry all day?"
ALLURA says: "Hmmm?"
ALLURA says: "What?"
ALLURA says: "Dinner and a show?"
SHIRO says: ""You and I have some work to do."
SHIRO says: "Work with me."
SHIRO says: "What do I have to do to strengthen our bond?"
SHIRO says: "Whoa!"
SHIRO says: "Hey!"
SHIRO says: "What are you doing?"
SHIRO says: "Stop."
SHIRO says: "Stop!"
SHIRO says: "I said stop!"
SHIRO says: "Turn around."
SHIRO says: "That's an order!"
CORAN says: ""Hello?"
CORAN says: "Back passengers?"
CORAN says: "Can you hear me?"
LANCE says: ""Oh, it's so comfy up here."
LANCE says: "Extra leg-room, heated seats!"
LANCE says: "Oh, man!"
HUNK says: ""Stupid Lance."
HUNK says: "Stupid shotgun."
CORAN says: ""Now, these swap moons are very dangerous environments."
CORAN says: "So be on your toes."
CORAN says: "No weapons or communication devices of any kind!"
CORAN says: "Also, I've brought along some disguises."
PIDGE says: ""Coran?"
PIDGE says: "This Unilu swap meet looks an awful lot like a regular mall."
CORAN says: ""It does seem to be a little cleaner than I remember."
CORAN says: "Still, be vigilant."
CORAN says: "The Unilu are cut-throat wheeler-dealers."
CORAN says: "So keep your hands on your coin satchels."
HUNK says: ""My satchels are empty."
CORAN says: ""Good."
KEITH says: ""Let's just get this over with."
CORAN says: ""Yes, right."
CORAN says: "Everyone, let's fan out, search the area for teludav lenses."
CORAN says: "We'll meet by the giant ticking clock here in one vaga."
CORAN says: "Don't be late, and try to blend in."
VARKON says: ""What the?"
VARKON says: "Space pirates!"
VARKON says: "Disguising yourselves as harmless shoppers, huh?"
VARKON says: "Well, it won't work."
VARKON says: "Don't worry, Emperor Zarkon."
VARKON says: "I know you can't be here to protect the mall but your faithful number two is on the case."
VARKON says: "Hope you pirates are ready to face Varkon."
SHIRO says: ""Come on!"
SHIRO says: "I don't know where you're headed but you need to start listening to me right now!"
SHIRO says: "That's better."
SHIRO says: "Where are we?"
SHIRO says: "Why did you bring me here?"
SHIRO says: "What are you trying to tell me?"
SHIRO says: "So you want me to see through your eyes."
SHIRO says: "Was this your home?"
HUNK says: ""Okay, if I were a 10,000-year-old wormhole lens, where would I be?"
HUNK says: "Excuse me, hey, hi, excuse me, hi!"
HUNK says: "Wow, you guys are really booking here."
HUNK says: "So I was just wondering if you guys knew where I could find some lenses for my ship around here?"
HUNK says: "Is there a one-hour lens place around here or something?"
HUNK says: "Anything?"
HUNK says: "Nothing?"
HUNK says: "Never mind, you know what?"
HUNK says: "I'll catch up with you guys later!"
HUNK says: "Oh!"
HUNK says: "This is beautiful!"
HUNK says: "Maybe the scaultrite is under these samples."
HUNK says: "I don't know."
HUNK says: "Rubbery."
HUNK says: "Sweet and salty."
HUNK says: "So cold, but spicy."
HUNK says: "Mmm, eh What's next, what do you got?"
SAL says: ""Five hundred GAC."
HUNK says: ""Five hundred GAC."
SAL says: ""Excuse me?"
SAL says: "Sustenance provided by Vrepit Sal, that's me."
SAL says: "Five hundred GAC is now owed."
HUNK says: ""I thought this was a "free sample" situation."
HUNK says: "Free?"
HUNK says: "Of charge."
HUNK says: "You know, gratis?"
HUNK says: "Look, I don't have any money."
HUNK says: "So, you know Oh, man!"
HUNK says: "How long you been here?"
DISH WASHER says: ""Sal put me in when I was just a little girl."
DISH WASHER says: "Oh, no!"
KNIFE SELLER says: ""Let me show you this wonderful workings of the Galasu X-90 Extreme Blade System."
KNIFE SELLER says: "It slices, it dices, it kills, slaughters, and skins and constantly stays razor sharp!"
KNIFE SELLER says: "Look at it cut through this bloato fruit."
KNIFE SELLER says: "Paper thin."
KNIFE SELLER says: "How much would you pay for this knife?"
KNIFE SELLER says: "But wait, there's more!"
KNIFE SELLER says: "How many times have you had to fight off a charging rock monster and then go immediately to a picnic?"
KNIFE SELLER says: "All the time, right?"
KNIFE SELLER says: "The Galasu can cut through rocks and still cut bloato fruit paper thin."
KNIFE SELLER says: "Now how much would you pay?"
KNIFE SELLER says: "Seriously, how much?"
KNIFE SELLER says: "I have a lot of these to unload."
KEITH says: ""I just had a question."
KNIFE SELLER says: ""Fine!"
KNIFE SELLER says: "What do you got?"
KNIFE SELLER says: "Have you ever come across something like this?"
KNIFE SELLER says: "Whoa, this craftsmanship is incredible!"
KNIFE SELLER says: "And is this a luxite blade?"
KNIFE SELLER says: "The planet they mine that from hasn't existed in decafebes."
KNIFE SELLER says: "Where'd you get this?"
KEITH says: ""Someone gave it to me."
KNIFE SELLER says: ""Okay, that's vague."
KNIFE SELLER says: "Tell you what I'll give you 1,000 GAC to take it off your hands."
KEITH says: ""It's not for sale."
KNIFE SELLER says: ""Two thousand."
KEITH says: ""No, thanks."
KEITH says: "Give it back."
KNIFE SELLER says: ""How about this?"
KNIFE SELLER says: "I keep the knife and you beat it before security gets here."
KNIFE SELLER says: "I know it's stolen."
KEITH says: ""It's not stolen."
KNIFE SELLER says: ""Then tell me where you got it."
KNIFE SELLER says: "Hey!"
KNIFE SELLER says: "Come back with that!"
VARKON says: ""Trouble at the Slice Capades?"
VARKON says: "It's one of those pirates!"
VARKON says: "I knew they looked edgy."
VARKON says: "Varkon's comin' for ya!"
SHIRO says: ""So this was Zarkon's home planet."
SHIRO says: "Show me more."
SHIRO says: "King Alford built you from that comet."
SHIRO says: "And you fought beside him."
SHIRO says: "With Zarkon."
ZARKON says: ""You!"
ALLURA says: ""Absolutely stunning!"
ALLURA says: "After we defeat Zarkon, I'm taking you on the road!"
PIDGE says: ""I'll just hold it."
ALIEN says: "":Can I interest you in the latest Earth fashions?"
PIDGE says: ""Lance, come on!"
PIDGE says: "We have to be back at the ticking clock in a half hour."
LANCE says: ""But Pidge, wait, look at all this crazy Earth stuff this * ALIEN: " is selling!"
LANCE says: "We're supposed to be looking for the teludav lenses and you're looking in the one store we know for certain won't have Oh, my gosh!"
LANCE says: "Is that Killbot Phantasm 1?"
LANCE says: "The first journey to the depths of the demon sphere?"
LANCE says: "Oh!"
LANCE says: "Mercury Gameflux Two!"
LANCE says: "With the original power glove that gives you infinite lives if you touch the index finger to the pinky!"
LANCE says: "We have to have this!"
LANCE says: "How much is this?"
ALIEN says: "":Twelve hundred GAC."
PIDGE says: ""Is that a lot?"
LANCE says: ""Well, compared to what we have, which is none, yes."
LANCE says: "It's a lot."
PIDGE says: ""We're gonna find some money."
PIDGE says: "Come on!"
PIDGE says: "Don't sell that!"
ALIEN says: "":Don't worry."
ALIEN says: "I never sell anything."
ALIEN says: "Do I, Kaltenecker?"
CORAN says: ""Ah, one of the Unilu."
UNILU GIRL says: ""Like, can I help you?"
CORAN says: ""Yes."
CORAN says: "Can you tell me where the "other" market is?"
UNILU GIRL says: ""The what?"
CORAN says: ""Well, some might call it the "black market."
UNILU GIRL says: ""Ummm, I don't think I know that."
UNILU GIRL says: "Maybe check there."
CORAN says: ""I don't think this would be "on" the map."
CORAN says: "It might be more "off-book."
CORAN says: "" Hm?"
CORAN says: "Maybe this will help you remember?"
UNILU GIRL says: ""Again, what?"
CORAN says: ""Ah, the old Unilu shakedown, eh?"
CORAN says: "Fine."
CORAN says: "Starting to get a fuzzy recollection yet?"
UNILU GIRL says: ""Who is this?"
UNILU GIRL says: "Is this you?"
CORAN says: ""No!"
CORAN says: "That-that's King Groggery the Infirm!"
CORAN says: "You know what?"
CORAN says: "I'll find it myself!"
UNILU GIRL says: ""Uck!"
UNILU GIRL says: "I'm so out of this dump."
HUNK says: ""I gotta escape somehow."
HUNK says: "Maybe I can scrub through these cuffs."
SAL says: ""Forty-three!"
SAL says: "Sustenance unit complete."
SAL says: "Ingest."
SAL says: "Huh?"
SAL says: "Oh, not again!"
SAL says: "Now who will be my sustenance preparer?"
HUNK says: ""I got this, Sal."
HUNK says: "Un-cuff me."
HUNK says: "You?"
HUNK says: ""Trust me."
HUNK says: "I'm an enthusiastic gourmand with an incredible palate."
HUNK says: "Also, your robot is dead on the floor."
SAL says: ""That last part is true."
SAL says: "All right, work."
HUNK says: ""Okay, now watch this!"
HUNK says: "I can't read this."
HUNK says: "Doesn't matter."
HUNK says: "I'll just improvise."
HUNK says: "Do you smell how the tanginess of tuber masture really brings out the charred flavor from the palmagoren fillet?"
HUNK says: "No, no, we won't be using that."
HUNK says: "Let's just say, "Number 44?"
HUNK says: "Your order's up."
HUNK says: "" Enjoy your meal."
SAL says: ""What did you do to her face?"
SAL says: "It's cracking!"
HUNK says: ""She's smiling!"
HUNK says: "She's enjoying her food."
HUNK says: "Okay, let's provide some sustenance!"
SHIRO says: ""Show me more."
SHIRO says: "Those wings."
SHIRO says: "You have powers I haven't unlocked."
SHIRO says: "Incredible!"
ZARKON says: ""I've got you now, paladin."
ZARKON says: "You are a fool to face me here."
ZARKON says: "When you die in this realm, your body dies as well."
ZARKON says: "And then I will take control of Voltron."
VARKON says: ""I'll find you pirates!"
VARKON says: "What's going on here?"
VARKON says: "Official business, excuse me, this is a fire hazard."
VARKON says: "I'm in the middle of a hot pursuit."
HUNK says: ""I said "over medium"."
HUNK says: "Over medium, you rube!"
HUNK says: "Does this look over medium to you?"
SAL says: ""No, Chef."
HUNK says: ""Then let's get it right, huh?"
HUNK says: "If it ain't perfect, it ain't coming out of this kitchen, people!"
HUNK says: "Sauce me!"
HUNK says: "Now you're getting it!"
HUNK says: "Bon appaetit."
VARKON says: ""I got you now, pirate!"
VARKON says: "Where are your friends?"
HUNK says: ""Don't forget what I taught you!"
HUNK says: "Those are the fundamentals of cooking!"
SAL says: ""Uhhhh!"
SAL says: "That kid is a genius."
SAL says: "I don't care if we have to search the entire galaxy!"
SAL says: "I want him back at Vrepit Sal's!"
ZARKON says: ""You could never take my place as the head of Voltron."
SHIRO says: ""You can't pilot the Black Lion after everything you've done!"
SHIRO says: "You can never lead Voltron again!"
SHIRO says: "You're no paladin!"
ZARKON says: ""You have no idea how to command a weapon like this!"
SHIRO says: ""No one commands the Black Lion!"
ZARKON says: ""You dare lecture me?"
ZARKON says: "Do you think the Black Lion would allow such a feeble creature to pilot it?"
ZARKON says: "Only the powerful can command it."
SHIRO says: ""You've forgotten what's most important between a lion and its paladin."
SHIRO says: "It's not about power."
SHIRO says: "It's about earning each other's trust."
ZARKON says: ""Trust has nothing to do with it."
ZARKON says: "The lion is mine, forever."
ZARKON says: "Huh?"
ZARKON says: "Nooooo!"
HAGGAR says: ""Sire, what is it?"
ZARKON says: ""My connection grows weaker."
ZARKON says: "We must hurry if we ever wish to reclaim Voltron."
SHIRO says: ""Did you just save me?"
SHIRO says: "Thank you."
SHIRO says: "Let's go home."
SHIRO says: "We never left."
PIDGE says: ""Oh, this tenner looks like the last one."
PIDGE says: "So how much have we got?"
LANCE says: ""Eleven hundred and ninety-six GAC."
PIDGE says: ""We're so close!"
PIDGE says: "Lance, look!"
LANCE says: ""Already on it!"
PIDGE says: ""Yeah!"
PIDGE says: "Let's go!"
LANCE says: ""Thanks!"
HUNK says: ""Gotta hide!"
HUNK says: "Gotta hide!"
HUNK says: "Keith!"
HUNK says: "He's right behind me!"
KEITH says: ""Who?"
VARKON says: ""Pirate number two!"
VARKON says: "My lucky day!"
ALIEN says: "":Hold on."
ALIEN says: "With every purchase, you get a free Kaltenecker."
HUNK says: ""Time to get moving, guys!"
KEITH says: ""Security's on our tail!"
VARKON says: ""There's the rest of the crew!"
LANCE says: ""Everyone hop on Kaltenecker!"
HUNK says: ""Did you buy a cow?"
PIDGE says: ""It was free with purchase!"
CORAN says: ""Hold on a tick, this looks familiar!"
CORAN says: "Oh, lookie-lookie."
CORAN says: "An original Unilu swap shop!"
UNILU SHOPKEEPER says: ""Good eye, friend."
UNILU SHOPKEEPER says: "This shop's been in my family since before the empire began."
UNILU SHOPKEEPER says: "Can I interest you in a butcher barrel?"
UNILU SHOPKEEPER says: "Or perhaps a set of window breakers?"
CORAN says: ""Teludav lenses!"
CORAN says: "Yes!"
CORAN says: "I mean, I don't have any idea what these pieces of junk are."
UNILU SHOPKEEPER says: ""I see you've got your eye on these antique glass table toppers here."
CORAN says: ""Well, they're pretty ugly."
CORAN says: "But I do have an empty curio cabinet for grotesqueries."
CORAN says: "How much do you want?"
UNILU SHOPKEEPER says: ""How much have you got?"
CORAN says: ""Oh, I have a handful of pocket lint."
UNILU SHOPKEEPER says: ""I'll take your first-born child."
CORAN says: ""I might be able to throw in a used handkerchief."
UNILU SHOPKEEPER says: ""I could accept your left foot."
CORAN says: ""I'd be willing to sing you a song!"
UNILU SHOPKEEPER says: ""You become my butler for one year."
CORAN says: ""Two Altean crown bills."
UNILU SHOPKEEPER says: ""Five Valuvium ingots."
CORAN says: ""Oh, would you accept an IOU?"
UNILU SHOPKEEPER says: ""Of course."
UNILU SHOPKEEPER says: "I'll just need some collateral."
UNILU SHOPKEEPER says: "Maybe ten Valuvium ingots!"
CORAN says: ""Or how about this?"
CORAN says: "One Olkari flying cube."
UNILU SHOPKEEPER says: ""You've got a deal!"
PIDGE says: ""There he is!"
KEITH says: ""We gotta go, Coran!"
CORAN says: ""I got the scaultrite lenses!"
UNILU SHOPKEEPER says: ""Scaultrite?"
UNILU SHOPKEEPER says: "Hold on a tick!"
CORAN says: ""Uh-uh!"
CORAN says: "No take-backs!"
VARKON says: ""Get back here!"
VARKON says: "Doggone it!"
VARKON says: "You better run!"
VARKON says: "Don't let me catch you in my jurisdiction again, pirates!"
LANCE says: ""Oh, so you can't follow us outside, huh?"
VARKON says: ""That's one for Varkon."
CORAN says: ""We got our lenses!"
ALLURA says: ""Excellent!"
ALLURA says: "Now, we can get the teludav up and running."
KEITH says: ""Where's Shiro?"
ALLURA says: ""What did you do?"
ALLURA says: "Take a nap?"
SHIRO says: ""Not exactly."
SHIRO says: "Is that a cow?"
LANCE says: ""Mm-hmm, his name is Kaltenecker."
KEITH says: ""So, did you find a way to bond with your lion?"
SHIRO says: ""Yes, and we need to get moving."
SHIRO says: "We're headed for the Blade of Marmora's headquarters."
CORAN says: ""I'll plot a course."
PIDGE says: ""While you're doing that, I'm gonna hook up the video game Lance and I bought."
LANCE says: ""Yeah!"
LANCE says: "Let's get this baby set up."
PIDGE says: ""Where can we..."
PIDGE says: "How do..."
PIDGE says: "Nooooo!"
