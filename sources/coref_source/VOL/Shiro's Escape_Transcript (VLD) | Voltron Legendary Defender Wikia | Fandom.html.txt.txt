HUNK says: ""Is he okay?"
ALLURA says: ""Sometimes, the healing process can cause involuntary brain wave reactions."
HUNK says: ""He looks like he's having a bad dream."
KEITH says: ""He just got blasted by a space witch and mauled by giant lizards."
KEITH says: "What dream could be worse than that?"
SHIRO says: ""No, no!"
SHIRO says: "No."
SHIRO says: "You took my hand."
SHIRO says: "What more do you want?"
ULAZ says: ""Stop!"
ULAZ says: "I want him awake enough to feel this."
ULAZ says: "Listen to me."
ULAZ says: "We don't have much time."
ULAZ says: "Wake up!"
ULAZ says: "Zarkon has located the Blue Lion of Voltron on your planet, Earth."
ULAZ says: "You must get it before he does."
SHIRO says: ""What are you doing?"
ULAZ says: ""I've planted a bomb to cover your escape."
ULAZ says: "Get to a pod, now."
SHIRO says: ""Who are you?"
ULAZ says: ""I am Ulaz."
ULAZ says: "Now, come on!"
ULAZ says: "Zarkon will know that I released you, so I must disappear."
ULAZ says: "But, if you survive, go to the coordinates in your arm."
ULAZ says: "The Blade of Marmora is with you."
SHIRO says: ""Why are you helping me?"
ULAZ says: ""As a fighter and a leader, you give hope."
ULAZ says: "Hurry!"
ULAZ says: "Earth needs you."
ULAZ says: "We all do."
PROROK says: ""You know I'm innocent!"
PROROK says: "I would never betray Zarkon!"
PROROK says: "You're weakening the empire!"
HAGGAR says: ""You misunderstand."
HAGGAR says: "I'm giving you the opportunity to serve the empire."
HAGGAR says: "You will have the honor of personally bringing down Voltron."
PIDGE says: ""I'm not finding any coordinates in here."
PIDGE says: "Are you sure this wasn't just a dream?"
SHIRO says: ""I'm positive."
SHIRO says: "Someone helped me escape."
ALLURA says: ""And he was Galra?"
SHIRO says: ""Yes."
ALLURA says: ""You know you cannot trust them."
SHIRO says: ""Your father must have trusted them once."
SHIRO says: "Zarkon was the original Black Paladin, wasn't he?"
ALLURA says: ""That was a long time ago."
LANCE says: ""Wait, what?"
KEITH says: ""Didn't you see how he stole the Black Lion right out from Shiro?"
KEITH says: "Or that he could do all that cool stuff with his bayard?"
KEITH says: "Shiro's bayard?"
KEITH says: "You know, the black one?"
SHIRO says: ""the truth about Zarkon?"
ALLURA says: ""I wanted to protect you from the dark history of the paladins so that you would have a chance to bond with your lions on your own."
ALLURA says: "You are the Black Paladin now, not Zarkon."
SHIRO says: ""Yeah, well, the Black Lion may have a different take on the matter."
PIDGE says: ""Wait a second."
PIDGE says: "I think I see it now."
PIDGE says: "Some repeating numbers in all this Galra code."
PIDGE says: "Let me extract it."
PIDGE says: "They are coordinates!"
PIDGE says: "They lead here: the Thaldycon system."
SHIRO says: ""Then, that's where we're headed."
KEITH says: ""Shiro, are you sure you can trust this?"
KEITH says: "I mean, after all the Galra have done to you They They took your arm."
SHIRO says: ""It's worth the risk."
SHIRO says: "Someone helped me escape."
SHIRO says: "If we can locate some allies in our fight against Zarkon, especially ones from his own side, we might just find a way to take him down."
ALLURA says: ""We can check the location, but I do not like this."
ALLURA says: "The Galra are not to be trusted."
CORAN says: ""Well, this is it."
CORAN says: "No sign of any activity at all, living or otherwise."
SHIRO says: ""Can we get in there to take a closer look?"
CORAN says: ""I don't want to bring the Castle any closer."
CORAN says: "Those xanthorium chunks contain highly unstable nitrate salts."
CORAN says: "Even bumping one of them can blow us straight to Wozblay."
SHIRO says: ""Are you sure this is right?"
SHIRO says: "These are the coordinates Number Five gave me."
PIDGE says: ""Hey!"
PIDGE says: "My decryption is solid."
SHIRO says: ""There must be something we're missing."
ALLURA says: ""We should get out of here."
ALLURA says: "We've checked it out, but now, it's time to move on."
SHIRO says: ""No."
SHIRO says: "There must be something more to this."
SHIRO says: "I can feel it."
SHIRO says: "I think we should wait."
HAGGAR says: ""Sire, Prorok's transformation is complete."
HAGGAR says: "We only need to know where to send him."
HAGGAR says: "Now, reach out with your mind!"
ZARKON says: ""I have the coordinates to launch the beast."
CORAN says: ""There's an intruder in the Castle!"
LANCE says: ""How could someone just sneak aboard the ship?"
ALLURA says: ""I knew coming here was a mistake!"
ALLURA says: "There he is."
ALLURA says: "Level five."
SHIRO says: ""Everyone, suit up."
LANCE says: ""I got him."
SHIRO says: ""Keep eyes on him, Lance."
SHIRO says: "We're all headed toward you."
LANCE says: ""Hold it right there!"
CORAN says: ""Careful, he's faster than an angry klanmÃ¼irl!"
CORAN says: "But he can jump like a sprightly globinheffer!"
LANCE says: ""Coran, you're not helping!"
CORAN says: ""Somebody's as mad as a wet chÃ¼per."
CORAN says: "Coming your way, Number Five!"
PIDGE says: ""I got him!"
PIDGE says: "I don't got him!"
CORAN says: ""He's dragging Pidge away!"
PIDGE says: ""Come back here!"
HUNK says: ""Huh?"
PIDGE says: ""Hunk!"
HUNK says: ""Huh?"
HUNK says: "Sorry!"
CORAN says: ""Oh, Hunk failed the team, guys."
HUNK says: ""Hey!"
CORAN says: ""All right, it's up to Keith now."
KEITH says: ""Copy that."
KEITH says: "I'm ready."
CORAN says: ""Oh, this is exciting!"
CORAN says: "He's got a sword."
CORAN says: "One young paladin, one seemingly indestructible foe Swing and a miss!"
CORAN says: "Oh, another swing and a miss!"
CORAN says: "He can't touch him!"
CORAN says: "He's too fast!"
CORAN says: "He knocked his bayard out of his hands!"
CORAN says: "It's on the ground!"
SHIRO says: ""Ulaz?"
ALLURA says: ""Who are you?"
SHIRO says: ""Stop!"
SHIRO says: "It's him!"
SHIRO says: "This is the Galra who set me free."
ULAZ says: ""You've come."
SHIRO says: ""I don't think this is necessary."
ALLURA says: ""I will not have some quiznak-ing Galra soldier on the bridge of my ship!"
ULAZ says: ""If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already."
ALLURA says: ""Are your Galra threats supposed to win my trust?"
ALLURA says: "I'm not trying to win your trust."
ALLURA says: "I'm trying to win a war."
ALLURA says: "And, because of Shiro, we are closer than we've ever been."
ALLURA says: "Our gamble on you paid off better than we could have ever imagined."
SHIRO says: ""When you released me, you also mentioned that there were others working with you."
ULAZ says: ""Yes."
ULAZ says: "We are called the Blade of Marmora."
HUNK says: ""Uh, others?"
HUNK says: "Are they here?"
LANCE says: ""Hunk, can you try not to act so scared around the chained-up prisoner?"
LANCE says: "It makes us seem a little lame."
ULAZ says: ""I am alone on this base."
ALLURA says: ""What is this base you're talking about?"
ALLURA says: "Shiro's coordinates just led us to this wasteland."
ULAZ says: ""The base is hidden."
ULAZ says: "Now that I know it is Shiro that has come, you are welcome to our outpost."
ULAZ says: "It lies dead ahead."
PIDGE says: ""Behind all the xanthorium clusters?"
ULAZ says: ""No."
ULAZ says: "Right in front of it, in a hidden pocket of space-time."
ALLURA says: ""Coran, are you hearing this?"
CORAN says: ""I am picking up some kind of anomaly on the screen."
CORAN says: "I suppose it could be a cloaked base."
ULAZ says: ""Just fly straight for the center of the xanthorium cluster."
ULAZ says: "You will see."
ALLURA says: ""You think you're going to get me to destroy our ship just because you say so?"
SHIRO says: ""We came out here to find some answers."
SHIRO says: "Are we going to turn back now?"
KEITH says: ""You know I trust you, Shiro, but this doesn't feel right."
LANCE says: ""And you know I hate to agree with Keith, but it's a big fat ditto for me."
PIDGE says: ""Galra could have implanted fake memories of the escape in your head."
HUNK says: ""Oh, come on, that would be so evil, which, of course, they are."
HUNK says: "But they'd have to come up with some molecular level storage unit, which his hand does have."
HUNK says: "But, to be linked up to memory, it would need a direct pathway to his brain, which yeah."
SHIRO says: ""Ulaz freed me."
SHIRO says: "Without him, we wouldn't be here."
ALLURA says: ""Fine."
ALLURA says: "Slow and steady, Coran."
ALLURA says: "Head for the xanthorium cluster."
CORAN says: ""Yes, Princess."
CORAN says: "Beginning approach."
CORAN says: "Impact imminent in five, four three, two."
CORAN says: "Well, that's something."
ALLURA says: ""What is it?"
CORAN says: ""Putting it up on the screens."
PIDGE says: ""Amazing."
PIDGE says: "They're folding space."
HUNK says: ""It's like a space taco."
HUNK says: "Or a space calzone."
HUNK says: "Or a space-time soup dumpling and we're the soup."
HUNK says: "Hey, is there a cafeteria on this thing?"
ULAZ says: ""Welcome to the Blade of Marmora Communications Base Thaldycon."
ULAZ says: "Now, if you'll free me, I need to send a message to the leadership."
ULAZ says: "They need to know I've made contact with Voltron."
ALLURA says: ""Go with him and keep an eye on him."
ALLURA says: "I'm staying here."
HUNK says: ""Oh!"
HUNK says: "Can we go?"
PIDGE says: ""I want to see how they make the space pocket!"
LANCE says: ""You guys go ahead."
LANCE says: "I'll hang back and protect the princess."
ULAZ says: ""This is the gravity generator that creates the space-time fold that hides the station."
ULAZ says: "It was created by a reclusive genius engineer named Slav."
ULAZ says: "His technology allows the Blade of Marmora to remain hidden while we work to take down the Galra Empire."
ULAZ says: "Zarkon would do anything to get his hands on this technology."
KEITH says: ""There are Galra out there that aren't loyal to Zarkon?"
ULAZ says: ""We thought expanding the Galra Empire would bring stability."
ULAZ says: "We learned too late, a tyrant doesn't seek stability, only power."
ULAZ says: "With our members working on the inside, planning coordinated attacks with Voltron, we may finally have a chance."
HUNK says: ""So, you have agents working within Zarkon's ranks?"
ULAZ says: ""How do you think you got away from Zarkon in that last fight?"
ULAZ says: "Do you think those shields around Zarkon's command center went down on their own?"
ULAZ says: "We've got people risking their lives in this war, just like you."
PIDGE says: ""If you have people on the inside, can they tell me where my family is?"
PIDGE says: "They were taken the same time Shiro was."
ULAZ says: ""I knew others from Earth were captured."
ULAZ says: "I never saw them, but I have some records of Galra prisoners here."
ULAZ says: "I can transmit them to your ship."
KEITH says: ""What's that weapon you carry?"
ULAZ says: ""It's a ceremonial blade that each member of our order carries."
KEITH says: ""Hmm, nice."
KEITH says: "Huh?"
ULAZ says: ""Oh, no!"
ULAZ says: "You were tracked!"
ULAZ says: "What?"
ULAZ says: "Us?"
KEITH says: ""If Zarkon knows we're here, it's because you ratted us out."
HUNK says: ""It's another one of Zarkon's robot beast ro-beasts!"
SHIRO says: ""We have to get back to the ship."
ULAZ says: ""Shiro, wait."
ULAZ says: "These are instructions on how to reach the Blade of Marmora headquarters."
ULAZ says: "Before you go there, find out how Zarkon is tracking you."
ULAZ says: "If you lead him there, our entire underground network, everything we've spent centuries building, will be lost."
ALLURA says: ""I knew he cannot be trusted!"
SHIRO says: ""It wasn't him."
ALLURA says: ""How can you be sure?"
CORAN says: ""It doesn't matter now."
CORAN says: "What should we do?"
HUNK says: ""Why can't we hide here in the space clam and wait for it to go away?"
SHIRO says: ""Everyone get to your lions, but don't launch."
SHIRO says: "We'll wait to see what it does."
SHIRO says: "I don't want to risk fighting it if we don't have to."
PIDGE says: ""We should be safe as long as we're hidden in the space pocket."
CORAN says: ""He's drawing in the xanthorium clusters."
HUNK says: ""I think he knows we're here."
CORAN says: ""Direct hit!"
CORAN says: "He definitely knows we're here!"
ALLURA says: ""Get the particle barrier up!"
CORAN says: ""He's readying another attack!"
ALLURA says: ""He's pulling us in as well!"
ALLURA says: "Paladins, I think it's time to launch!"
SHIRO says: ""Form Voltron!"
ALLURA says: ""We're exposed!"
ALLURA says: "The space fold has been lowered!"
CORAN says: ""Well, there goes Ulaz."
ALLURA says: ""I knew we should never trust a Galra!"
SHIRO says: ""Let's light this thing up."
SHIRO says: "Fire lasers!"
PIDGE says: ""Huh?"
KEITH says: ""Huh?"
PIDGE says: ""He's pulling in more ammo!"
SHIRO says: ""Move, move, move!"
SHIRO says: "Lance, Hunk, give me full reverse boosters!"
HUNK says: ""This thing wants to eat us like we're a space taco!"
SHIRO says: ""Can't get free!"
KEITH says: ""I'll make him back off!"
SHIRO says: ""We've got to keep some distance between us and that ro-beast!"
HUNK says: ""It's trying to pull us in again!"
LANCE says: ""I'm burning thrusters at full capacity and it's not making any difference!"
ALLURA says: ""Is everyone all right?"
LANCE says: ""Alive, yes."
LANCE says: "All right, no."
KEITH says: ""It's going for the Castle!"
PIDGE says: ""We need some way to stop its tractor beam!"
SHIRO says: ""I've got an idea."
SHIRO says: "Pidge, form shield!"
SHIRO says: "We can use the shield to block the beam!"
KEITH says: ""We stopped the beam."
KEITH says: "Now, what?"
SHIRO says: ""Now, we go on the offensive."
PIDGE says: ""The xanthorium clusters!"
PIDGE says: "We can use them!"
PIDGE says: ""The shield can't handle this much power!"
HUNK says: ""We might not be strong enough to beat this thing!"
ULAZ says: ""Hang on!"
SHIRO says: ""Ulaz?"
ULAZ says: ""I'm going to take it down from the inside!"
SHIRO says: ""Ulaz, no!"
SHIRO says: "Let us handle this!"
ULAZ says: ""Voltron is too valuable."
ULAZ says: "The universe needs you."
SHIRO says: ""Get ready!"
PIDGE says: ""Ulaz opened up the space pocket from inside!"
PIDGE says: "It's falling in on itself!"
HUNK says: ""He did it!"
KEITH says: ""Ulaz saved us."
SHIRO says: ""He's gone."
KEITH says: ""Sorry we doubted Ulaz, Shiro."
KEITH says: "He saved all our lives."
SHIRO says: ""I still have so many questions."
KEITH says: ""Do you think Zarkon is really tracking us?"
ALLURA says: ""We cannot know for sure."
ALLURA says: "Only Ulaz knew our whereabouts."
SHIRO says: ""You don't really think Ulaz gave us up?"
ULAZ says: ""After he sacrificed himself?"
KEITH says: ""Yeah!"
KEITH says: "Maybe Zarkon found out about this place on his own."
KEITH says: "He's probably been searching for the Blade of Marmora."
ALLURA says: ""It's clear the loss of Ulaz has caused you great concern, but, regardless of how Zarkon located us, we cannot stay here any longer."
ALLURA says: "It isn't safe."
KEITH says: ""We should meet up with the rest of Ulaz's group, finish what we started."
SHIRO says: ""No."
SHIRO says: "We're not going to the headquarters until we figure out how Zarkon found us."
SHIRO says: "We can't risk losing the only allies we have in this war."
