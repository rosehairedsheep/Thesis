ALL says: "Yeah!"
Shiro says: "Form sword!"
Zarkon says: "I want weapons systems activated immediately!"
Zarkon says: "Restart the entire crystal core manually if you have to!"
Haggar says: "Our ship may be without power, but we are not."
Haggar says: "I can use the komar to draw the quintessence directly from Voltron, rendering him lifeless."
Zarkon says: "It is time I face Voltron myself."
Haggar says: "No, lord!"
Haggar says: "It is certain death!"
Zarkon says: "Today, the Black Lion will be mine."
Haggar says: "Your obsession with the Black Lion is clouding your judgment!"
Haggar says: "You must not go out there!"
Haggar says: "Hurry!"
Haggar says: "We need to protect our emperor."
Shiro says: "Hit the engine systems!"
Allura says: "We've done it."
Allura says: "This is the end of Zarkon's reign."
Coran says: "Yes, Princess."
Zarkon says: "Ready my armor."
Scientist says: "But, lord, it has never been successfully tested."
Haggar says: "Begin the ritual!"
Shiro says: "Stay focused."
Shiro says: "We've neutralized the engines."
Shiro says: "Let's target the bridge."
Haggar says: "Ready..."
Lance says: "What is that?"
Kolivan says: "Oh, no."
Haggar says: "Attack!"
Allura says: "No!"
Coran says: "Paladins!"
Coran says: "Can you hear me?"
Coran says: "I thought the virus shut down all of Zarkon's power!"
Allura says: "That blast was not from the ship's weapons."
Allura says: "It was magic."
Kolivan says: "It must have been the komar."
Kolivan says: "Zarkon has been trying to develop a device to extract the quintessence from planets."
Kolivan says: "It appears he succeeded."
Coran says: "If it destroys planets, what did it do to the paladins?"
Allura says: "Paladins!"
Allura says: "Shiro!"
Allura says: "Can you hear me?"
Shiro says: "Yes, Princess."
Shiro says: "We're alive."
Coran says: "Oh, thank the ancients!"
Allura says: "Is Voltron operational?"
Hunk says: "It's not working."
Keith says: "I can't move my lion."
Coran says: "You've been hit with some kind of witchcraft that draws the quintessence out of you."
Coran says: "You need to get out of there!"
Coran says: "Another blast like that and you may not survive!"
Lance says: "Wait."
Lance says: "What's that?"
Allura says: "You must get moving."
Allura says: "Remember your training."
Allura says: "Remember all the battles you've been through."
Shiro says: "It's Zarkon."
Allura says: "We must buy them more time."
Allura says: "Get us in closer."
Allura says: "Divert all power to our weapons system."
Coran says: "What?"
Coran says: "Princess, we'll be defenseless!"
Allura says: "It's the only way."
Allura says: "Listen to me."
Allura says: "You are true paladins now."
Allura says: "Connect with your lions, reach out to each other!"
Allura says: "Fight!"
Allura says: "This cannot end now!"
Allura says: "Fire!"
Shiro says: "Allura!"
Shiro says: "Everybody, listen."
Shiro says: "We have to fight."
Shiro says: "We have to channel all our energy."
Shiro says: "Visualize five becoming one."
Shiro says: "We have to focus everything we have into moving Voltron."
Shiro says: "We are the last thing standing in the way of Zarkon's total universal domination."
Shiro says: "I'm not giving up that fight!"
Shiro says: "Are you, Hunk?"
Hunk says: "No."
Shiro says: "Pidge?"
Pidge says: "Never!"
Shiro says: "Lance?"
Lance says: "Let's go down swingin'."
Shiro says: "Keith?"
Keith says: "I'm all in."
Shiro says: "Then let's get Voltron back in this battle."
Zarkon says: "Now, I will take back what is mine!"
Haggar says: "Summon the energy again!"
Haggar says: "We must fight beside our emperor!"
Shiro says: "All right, let's hit him with the big guns."
Shiro says: "Hunk, form shoulder cannon!"
Shiro says: "Fire!"
Haggar says: "Attack!"
Shiro says: "Look out!"
Coran says: "Oh..."
Coran says: "Huh?"
Coran says: "Princess!"
Coran says: "Are you all right, Princess?"
Allura says: "I'm fine."
Allura says: "How badly is the Castle damaged?"
Coran says: "Our power levels are decimated."
Coran says: "Communications aren't working."
Coran says: "We can't reach the paladins."
Coran says: "I'm afraid we can't fight anymore."
Allura says: "We cannot give up."
Slav says: "Did we win yet?"
Allura says: "Coran, you and Slav do what you can to get the Castle functioning again."
Allura says: "Kolivan, can you get me to the komar?"
Kolivan says: "It will be dangerous, but I know a way."
Allura says: "You and Antok come with me."
Allura says: "We're going to have to attack the witch directly if we hope to stop that thing."
Allura says: "Coran, the bridge is yours."
Coran says: "No!"
Coran says: "You've been weakened by operating the teludav."
Coran says: "You can't face Haggar directly!"
Allura says: "We don't have a choice."
Pidge says: "We've never faced anything this powerful before."
Shiro says: "One way or another, this may be our last battle."
Shiro says: "We've got to give everything we have."
Shiro says: "Dig deep and fight!"
Haggar says: "Attack!"
Zarkon says: "This is my time to reclaim the Black Lion."
Zarkon says: "Nothing can stop me."
Shiro says: "He's trying to control my lion."
Shiro says: "I can feel him in my mind."
Keith says: "Fight it, Shiro!"
Zarkon says: "You should have fled like your predecessors."
Zarkon says: "Now, the time of the Voltron Paladins is finished."
Keith says: "Shiro!"
Keith says: "Shiro!"
Keith says: "Something's wrong with Shiro."
Keith says: "Guys, we can't let Zarkon get the Black Lion."
Kolivan says: "Antok!"
Pidge says: "Keep Zarkon away from the Black Lion!"
Keith says: "Come on!"
Keith says: "We can't give up!"
Hunk says: "I'm running out of strength, man."
Lance says: "Look out!"
Pidge says: "Hunk!"
Lance says: "Whoa..."
Lance says: "What did you do?"
Shiro says: "I've got Zarkon's bayard."
Keith says: "You mean you've got your bayard."
Keith says: "We've only got a few minutes left before power returns to Zarkon's ship."
Keith says: "Form Voltron!"
Forming Voltron sequence.
Allura says: "You're Altean?"
Haggar says: "Impossible!"
Allura says: "You will never destroy another innocent world!"
Kolivan says: "Come on!"
Castle beeping.
Coran says: "We're back!"
Coran says: "Hello, paladins!"
ALL says: "Yeah!"
Hunk says: "You're alive!"
Shiro says: "Is everyone okay?"
Slav says: "Yeah, I'm fine!"
Slav says: "Don't worry, guys!"
Lance says: "Oh, great."
Lance says: "Slav made it."
Coran says: "The power on Zarkon's ship is returning!"
Coran says: "We need to get out of here!"
Coran says: "I'm going to get Allura!"
Shiro says: "This is our last chance!"
Shiro says: "Let's finish this!"
Lance says: "Did we do it?"
Hunk says: "Is it over?"
Coran says: "I have Allura and Kolivan."
Coran says: "We need to go!"
Keith says: "Shiro!"

Haggar says: "Summon Prince Lotor."
