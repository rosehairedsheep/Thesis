ALLURA says: ""Zarkon!"
ALLURA says: "How did he find us?"
KEITH says: ""His commanders must have radioed him from Olkarion."
SHIRO says: ""We need to wormhole, now!"
SHIRO says: "Everyone to your stations."
SHIRO says: "We've got to put some distance between us and Zarkon."
SHIRO says: "This could be the fight of our lives."
KEITH says: ""That's sure a lot of fighters."
SHIRO says: ""Allura, can you evade these fighters?"
SHIRO says: "We can't have them following us through the wormhole."
ALLURA says: ""I can try."
SHIRO says: ""Keith, Lance, let's lay down some covering fire."
PIDGE says: ""Lance, incoming, 12 o'clock high!"
LANCE says: ""Got it!"
LANCE says: "Hey!"
KEITH says: ""Sorry!"
KEITH says: "Gotta be quick!"
LANCE says: ""How's that for quick?"
SHIRO says: ""You Knock it off, you two!"
SHIRO says: "Stay in your zones!"
LANCE says: ""Yeah, Keith!"
SHIRO says: ""Keep calling out those fighters, Pidge."
SHIRO says: "Hunk, how are the defenses holding?"
HUNK says: ""I don't know."
HUNK says: "Ten percent?"
HUNK says: "Fifteen maybe?"
HUNK says: "Everything's a blur."
HUNK says: "I've been up too long."
HUNK says: "I have tired eyes!"
SHIRO says: ""I know we just came off an intense battle, but we've got to stay focused, just until we jump."
CORAN says: ""And when is that?"
CORAN says: "They're still too close!"
CORAN says: "We need to gain more speed!"
ALLURA says: ""I've got an idea!"
ALLURA says: "Hold on!"
PIDGE says: ""Allura, what are you doing?"
ALLURA says: ""I'm going to use this moon's gravity to gain speed and put some distance between us and Zarkon."
CORAN says: ""We're clear to wormhole!"
LANCE says: ""We got away from Zarkon, how come we're still on alert?"
KEITH says: ""Coran, what's going on?"
CORAN says: ""Oh, no!"
CORAN says: "Teludav lens malfunction!"
CORAN says: "We're about to exit this wormhole a lot sooner than we planned!"
KEITH says: ""Whoa."
LANCE says: ""Where are we?"
LANCE says: "Looks like some sort of iceberg graveyard."
ALLURA says: ""Coran, what's the status?"
CORAN says: ""Checking that now."
CORAN says: "We didn't make it to our exit point, but we're several galaxies from Zarkon's fleet."
CORAN says: "Allura!"
CORAN says: "Allura!"
CORAN says: "Oh, no, you look exhausted."
CORAN says: "You must rest."
CORAN says: "You've been exerting way too much energy."
CORAN says: "I'll go check on the main turbine and figure out what's going—"
CORAN says: "Whoa!"
LANCE says: ""Are you all right?"
CORAN says: ""I'm fine."
CORAN says: "Look, I tell you what, I've probably hit a slippery spot on the ground there."
CORAN says: "Someone please wipe that up there!"
ALLURA says: ""You're sweating."
ALLURA says: "You might have a case of the slipperies."
CORAN says: ""What?"
CORAN says: "No!"
CORAN says: "No, that's an old person virus, and I'm not old."
CORAN says: "I'm young."
CORAN says: "Well, young-ish."
LANCE says: ""What are the slipperies?"
ALLURA says: ""It's a common Altean virus that occurs later in life."
ALLURA says: "It's not harmful and usually only lasts a couple of days, but it causes one's body to secrete extremely slick fluid."
PIDGE says: ""Ew!"
CORAN says: ""Yes, it is gross, so it's a good thing I don't have it!"
ALLURA says: ""Coran, it's nothing to be embarrassed about."
CORAN says: ""I'm not embarrassed because I don't have it!"
CORAN says: "And, now, I'm actually going to leave because I've got to fix the main turbine!"
CORAN says: "Quiznak!"
SHIRO says: ""All right."
SHIRO says: "Since Zarkon has no idea where we are, this is the perfect time to focus on our next step."
SHIRO says: "Maybe we can find that secret group, the Blade of Marmora."
SHIRO says: "Pidge, where are those coordinates?"
PIDGE says: ""Wait, hang on."
PIDGE says: "I'm so tired, my brain's not working."
LANCE says: ""Yeah, neither is mine."
CORAN says: ""Hello, all."
CORAN says: "I've checked the engines."
LANCE says: ""That was fast."
CORAN says: ""Well, I slipped right down I mean, hurried down."
CORAN says: "Anyway, the good news is, the Galra fighter did minimal damage."
CORAN says: "I flushed the turbine and it's fine."
CORAN says: "The bad news is, the teludav, or wormholer, as you Earthlings call it, is in bad shape."
CORAN says: "Several scaultrite lens-stones of the magnifying beam generator are cracked."
CORAN says: "As you know, the magnifying beam generator uses a crystal to convert Altean energy into usable fuel."
CORAN says: "That supplies the power needed to wormhole."
CORAN says: "Well, anyway, I need to remove the cracked lenses and readjust their trajectory temporarily until we can replace them."
CORAN says: "I'll also need to divert power to make up for the lost energy."
CORAN says: "Anyway, it's going to take at least a quintant."
SHIRO says: ""All right."
SHIRO says: "We'll hide the ship and get some rest while Coran comes up with a work-around."
SHIRO says: "Tomorrow, we'll be sharper and refocused."
LANCE says: ""Huh?"
LANCE says: "What the heck do you think you're doing?"
KEITH says: ""Allura said there's a pool."
KEITH says: "I'm gonna go check it out."
KEITH says: "What do you think you're doing?"
LANCE says: ""Same thing."
KEITH says: ""Look, you stay on one side of the pool and I'll stay on the other, and we'll be far, far away from each other."
KEITH says: "Very far away."
LANCE says: ""Hm?"
PIDGE says: ""Uh I thought you were exhausted."
PIDGE says: "Why are you making cookies?"
HUNK says: ""Because baking clears my head, Pidge."
HUNK says: "Okay?"
HUNK says: "I thought you were gonna help Coran with the wormholer."
PIDGE says: ""One mention of the slipperies and he got all sensitive and kicked me out."
PIDGE says: "I hate not being able to read Altean."
PIDGE says: "What is this stuff?"
PIDGE says: "Are you sure you're making food?"
HUNK says: ""You're gonna try and tell me that these aren't cookies?"
HUNK says: "Okay, I might have overcooked them."
HUNK says: "Wait, where you going?"
HUNK says: "You don't want to wait for the next batch?"
KEITH says: ""It's right, then left."
KEITH says: "You're off."
LANCE says: ""You're off!"
LANCE says: "And shoving too hard!"
KEITH says: ""You're not shoving hard enough!"
LANCE says: ""I should be at the pool right now!"
KEITH says: ""Would you stop whining?"
KEITH says: "Huh?"
KEITH says: "Look!"
LANCE says: ""Huh?"
LANCE says: "Huh?"
LANCE says: "What the heck?!"
LANCE says: "!"
KEITH says: ""Stupid Altean pools."
Computer says: ""Welcome to introductory Altean."
PIDGE says: ""Awesome!"
PIDGE says: "I'm finally gonna learn the Altean language!"
Computer says: ""Level, beginner."
Computer says: "Safety, off."
PIDGE says: ""Safety?"
PIDGE says: "That's weird."
Computer says: ""KlanmÃ¼irl."
PIDGE says: ""Klan-mural."
PIDGE says: "Hm?"
PIDGE says: "Uh, what's that?"
Computer says: ""KlanmÃ¼irl."
PIDGE says: ""Klan-mirl?"
PIDGE says: "KlanmÃeirl!"
PIDGE says: "KlanmÃeirl!"
PIDGE says: "Huh?"
Computer says: ""Kazrlgi Squikqwl."
PIDGE says: ""Oh, quiznak."
SHIRO says: ""What are you doing here?"
SHIRO says: "You should be resting."
ALLURA says: ""I cannot sleep."
ALLURA says: "Zarkon is out there."
ALLURA says: "He's searching for us."
SHIRO says: ""I know how you feel, but you have to step away for a while."
SHIRO says: "It's what's best for everyone."
ALLURA says: ""We are several galaxies away."
ALLURA says: "How could they find us so soon?"
HUNK says: ""Oh, no!"
HUNK says: "My good batch!"
HUNK says: "Huh?"
ALLURA says: ""Particle barrier!"
ALLURA says: "Up!"
ALLURA says: "Coran, are you there?"
CORAN says: ""I'm here!"
CORAN says: "Over here!"
CORAN says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
ALLURA says: ""Zarkon is back!"
ALLURA says: "What's our status?"
CORAN says: ""Wormholing will be a problem."
CORAN says: "The lenses haven't been readjusted!"
CORAN says: "I don't know if the teludav will generate enough power."
ALLURA says: ""Do everything you can!"
LANCE says: ""They found us again?"
LANCE says: "How is that possible?"
LANCE says: "Is that possible?"
LANCE says: "That doesn't seem possible!"
ALLURA says: ""Right now, we must figure out a way to get out of here."
KEITH says: ""Or we can stay and fight."
KEITH says: "Now's our chance."
KEITH says: "Form Voltron."
KEITH says: "Enough running!"
ALLURA says: ""It's too dangerous!"
ALLURA says: "Allura's right."
ALLURA says: "We can't take on Zarkon and his entire fleet."
ALLURA says: "Remember what happened at Zarkon's command center."
ALLURA says: "We wouldn't have escaped if the Blade of Marmora hadn't shut down the shield."
CORAN says: ""The turbine's up."
CORAN says: "Still working on the worm Uh, guys, I think I'm realizing now that I do, in fact, have a case of the slipperies."
CORAN says: ""I'm sorry I yelled at you, Pidge."
CORAN says: "I may need your help, after all."
PIDGE says: ""I'm coming down."
SHIRO says: ""Let's clear a path."
KEITH says: ""Lance, there's a fighter advancing on your nine!"
LANCE says: ""Thanks for the heads-up!"
LANCE says: "And you've got one going for the lower barrier."
KEITH says: ""Good eye!"
PIDGE says: ""What can I do?"
PIDGE says: "Help me divert power."
CORAN says: ""Slide me to that monitor!"
CORAN says: "Wipe my sweat!"
CORAN says: "Okay, buddy, you're mine."
LANCE says: ""What's going on?"
LANCE says: "I lost control of my defense drone!"
KEITH says: ""I got you covered!"
KEITH says: "Uh, I don't got you."
KEITH says: "Oh, there must be a system failure."
PIDGE says: ""Nope, that was us!"
PIDGE says: "We're diverting power from non-essential systems to get the wormhole generator working."
LANCE says: ""Shooting bad guys is pretty essential!"
HUNK says: ""We lost secondary controls!"
HUNK says: "Thermal regulator's offline!"
HUNK says: "Oh, no, there goes the particle barrier!"
CORAN says: ""Okay, try it!"
CORAN says: "We should be able to make one very small jump I hope."
PIDGE says: ""Is it gonna hold?"
CORAN says: ""I guess we're about to find out."
SHIRO says: ""The wormhole's open!"
CORAN says: ""Oh, no!"
CORAN says: "The lenses are breaking down even more!"
CORAN says: "We'll be out of the wormhole even sooner this time!"
SHIRO says: ""Zarkon keeps finding us."
SHIRO says: "It's like..."
SHIRO says: "he knows how to track us down."
SHIRO says: "Maybe he planted some kind of tracking device."
ALLURA says: ""Well, it is nothing on the ship."
ALLURA says: "The Castle would have detected any tracking devices."
SHIRO says: ""Until we figure out exactly how he's doing it, we should assume that he could show up at any minute."
SHIRO says: "So, stay alert."
HUNK says: ""Oh, man!"
HUNK says: "Oh, what's going on?"
HUNK says: "What are you guys doing?"
HUNK says: "What are you looking at?"
KEITH says: ""You woke yourself up snoring."
HUNK says: ""My bad."
SHIRO says: ""Coran, what's our status?"
SHIRO says: "Any good news?"
CORAN says: ""Actually, there is a bit of good news."
CORAN says: "I'm finally getting used to these slipperies."
CORAN says: "My mucus glands are working at an incredible rate!"
SHIRO says: ""Any good news about the teludav?"
CORAN says: ""I'm afraid not."
CORAN says: "The last jump overloaded the lens-stones."
CORAN says: "Now, even more of them are broken."
CORAN says: "I'm going to try some readjustments to change the beam trajectory."
CORAN says: "Until then, wormholing away will be impossible."
PIDGE says: ""Hey, there's a giant metallic storm ahead of us."
PIDGE says: "I think we can hide in the eye of the storm."
PIDGE says: "It should give off enough interference so we can't be tracked."
SHIRO says: ""It's worth a shot."
ALLURA says: ""Brilliant, Pidge."
ALLURA says: "We're essentially invisible to any radar, radio waves, universal scans, or any other known technology."
ALLURA says: ""No..."
ALLURA says: "."
ZARKON says: ""Send in the fighters, flush them out."
ZARKON says: "When they are within range, I will take control of the Black Lion."
PIDGE says: ""Okay, I don't know how he found us, but it definitely wasn't with normal instruments."
ALLURA says: ""It's me."
ALLURA says: "It's been me all along."
ALLURA says: "That's how they found us on planet Arus."
SHIRO says: ""It doesn't matter, Princess."
SHIRO says: "We're in this together."
SHIRO says: "We're gonna get out together."
KEITH says: ""Uh, how?"
KEITH says: "We're trapped."
SHIRO says: ""We need to form Voltron and go through the storm."
LANCE says: ""The storm?"
LANCE says: "What are you, nuts?"
HUNK says: ""Yeah!"
HUNK says: "What do you mean?"
HUNK says: "Yeah, why would we do that?"
SHIRO says: ""It's risky, I know, but it's our only chance."
SHIRO says: "We have to go through the storm, then lure Zarkon's ship away, giving Allura some time to get into open space."
ALLURA says: ""Then, what?"
SHIRO says: ""Then, we wormhole away."
SHIRO says: "Coran, remember how you said getting this Castle to wormhole is impossible?"
SHIRO says: "Well, I need you to do the impossible."
SHIRO says: ""Form Voltron!"
SHIRO says: "Team, let's draw those fighters out!"
SHIRO says: "I think it's working!"
SHIRO says: "They're following us!"
SHIRO says: "How's it coming, Coran?"
CORAN says: ""In order for this to work, each remaining lens-stone will need to take the equivalent of five beams!"
CORAN says: "There's no way it can hold that kind of power!"
CORAN says: "The whole thing will explode!"
HAGGAR says: ""We've lost them in the storm!"
ZARKON says: ""They won't be in there long."
SHIRO says: ""They can't follow us in this storm!"
SHIRO says: "It's tearing them apart!"
SHIRO says: "The debris!"
SHIRO says: "It's gonna tear us apart if we don't do something!"
SHIRO says: "Pidge, we're gonna need that shield!"
PIDGE says: ""On it!"
SHIRO says: ""And, Keith, the sword!"
KEITH says: ""Yes, sir!"
SHIRO says: ""Legs, I need everything you got!"
HUNK says: ""Roger!"
HUNK says: "Engaging lower thrusters!"
LANCE says: ""I'm right there with ya!"
ZARKON says: ""Get me closer to the Black Lion."
HAGGAR says: ""Sire, we have the Princess trapped."
HAGGAR says: "We can finish her now!"
ZARKON says: ""The Black Lion is all that matters!"
ALLURA says: ""Coran, here we go!"
KEITH says: ""It worked!"
HUNK says: ""They escaped!"
HUNK says: "What's going on?"
SHIRO says: ""My lion!"
SHIRO says: "Zarkon Zarkon's taking control of the Black Lion again!"
KEITH says: ""Fall back!"
ALLURA says: ""Paladins, now's your chance!"
ALLURA says: "Get out of there!"
SHIRO says: ""I forgot how intense Zarkon's connection to the Black Lion is."
SHIRO says: "We have to keep our distance, or risk losing Voltron."
SHIRO says: "Let's disband and get back to the Castle."
ZARKON says: ""Attack that Castle with everything we've got!"
ZARKON says: "Capture Voltron!"
KEITH says: ""Why haven't we wormholed yet?"
CORAN says: ""Because we can't!"
CORAN says: "We're missing several scaultrite lens-stones!"
CORAN says: "They've shattered!"
CORAN says: "Gone!"
CORAN says: "Don't exist!"
CORAN says: "Sloven-day-ho!"
CORAN says: "That's Altean for "gone."
PIDGE says: ""Wait, did you say "scaultrite"?"
PIDGE says: "I've seen that somewhere before."
PIDGE says: "I think Hunk was making some terrible cookies from that stuff!"
CORAN says: ""Unbelievable!"
CORAN says: "These cookies do have trace elements of scaultrite."
SHIRO says: ""Could they work?"
CORAN says: ""They might be able to hold for one jump, but we'd still need several people actually physically holding them."
CORAN says: "And, if the trajectories were calculated just so."
HUNK says: ""It just warms my heart that people are enjoying my cookies."
CORAN says: ""Okay, there."
CORAN says: "Now, nobody move if you want to live."
LANCE says: ""I think I moved!"
LANCE says: "I think I moved!"
CORAN says: ""Well, then move back to where you think you were!"
CORAN says: ""Okay, now, I'm going to monitor the beam from out there."
HUNK says: ""Wait, Coran!"
HUNK says: "How dangerous is this?"
CORAN says: ""Honestly, this is the most dangerous thing I've ever seen, or heard of, but since we're probably going to die anyway, what the heck, let's give it a shot!"
CORAN says: "Good luck, gentlemen and gentlelady."
CORAN says: "It's been a pleasure."
CORAN says: "Don't touch the lasers!"
CORAN says: "Uh They're in position!"
LANCE says: ""We're gonna die!"
LANCE says: "We're gonna die!"
LANCE says: "We're gonna die!"
PIDGE says: ""Hold tight, Lance!"
PIDGE says: "Hm?"
CORAN says: ""It's not working!"
ALLURA says: ""Coran, what's happening?"
ALLURA says: "Zarkon's right on top of us!"
CORAN says: ""The stones aren't reflecting properly!"
CORAN says: "I need something to shine them up!"
CORAN says: "Oh Wait a second."
CORAN says: "I think I've got it."
CORAN says: "Hit the wormhole in ten ticks!"
ALLURA says: ""Ten."
HUNK says: ""What's happening?"
ALLURA says: ""Nine."
CORAN says: ""No one move!"
CORAN says: "I've got to shine these stones!"
CORAN says: "Good thing I've got a case of the slipperies!"
ALLURA says: ""Six five four three two."
LANCE says: ""Huh?"
ALLURA says: ""One!"
ALLURA says: "Great work, team!"
ALLURA says: "We made it!"
ALLURA says: "Huh?"
HAGGAR says: ""We were close, sire, but it appears they were able to make a full jump."
ZARKON says: ""There is no place in this universe beyond my vision's reach."
ZARKON says: "Time is on my side."
ZARKON says: "Set a course for Voltron."
