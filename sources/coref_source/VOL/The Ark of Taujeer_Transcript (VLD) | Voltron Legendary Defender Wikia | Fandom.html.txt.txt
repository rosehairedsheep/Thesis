TAUJEER says: ""Stay back."
TAUJEER says: "You have already taken all our supplies and resources."
TAUJEER says: "My people are loaded on that ark, ready to leave our beloved home before it dissolves completely."
TAUJEER says: "Don't take our only means of escape."
MARVOK says: ""You still have one engine left, Baujal."
MARVOK says: "Not to mention a very viable collection of parts."
MARVOK says: "If your people are strong enough to survive, they will."
MARVOK says: "That is the Galra way."
MARVOK says: ""Morvok!"
ALLURA says: ""There's no point in debating this further."
ALLURA says: "Zarkon is clearly tracking us through me."
LANCE says: ""Aww, space baloney."
PIDGE says: ""That's not possible."
ALLURA says: ""Why would that be so hard to believe?"
ALLURA says: "Zarkon's forces showed up on Arus only after I awoke."
LANCE says: ""She's got a point."
LANCE says: "I would absolutely travel across the galaxy to find you."
KEITH says: ""It's not you, Princess Allura."
KEITH says: "It's me."
HUNK says: ""Because?"
HUNK says: "I just think Zarkon must've imprinted on me during our fight or something."
PIDGE says: ""Look, the fact is, we don't know how Zarkon is tracking us."
PIDGE says: "It could be through the Black Lion."
PIDGE says: "Every time Zarkon gets close to it, Shiro has to fight him for control."
CORAN says: ""That's only when Zarkon is nearby."
CORAN says: "No Paladin has ever been able to connect with a lion over a vast distance."
HUNK says: ""So what are we going to do?"
SHIRO says: ""Look, it doesn't matter how he's tracking us because we're gonna take the fight to the Galra soon enough."
SHIRO says: "They've been chasing us from galaxy to galaxy."
SHIRO says: "The last thing they expect is for us to come after them."
LANCE says: ""The hunter becomes the hunted, hmm?"
LANCE says: "Awesome!"
LANCE says: "That's the tag line from like six of my favorite movies."
PIDGE says: ""As it happens, I took our list of recent Galra attacks and analyzed it for both commonalities and anomalies among the attack sites."
PIDGE says: "I was hoping to create an algorithm that would, within a statistically acceptable margin of error, provide a list of target-rich Galra environments color-coded, of course, because what are we, animals?"
LANCE says: ""Cool!"
LANCE says: "What is it again?"
HUNK says: ""It's a Galra finder?"
HUNK says: "Well, "finder" suggests that it locates the Galra, whereas it would be more accurate to say that my model predicts their likeliest Fine."
HUNK says: "It's a Galra finder."
LANCE says: ""So, where are the Galra?"
PIDGE says: ""The nearest ones are right here."
PIDGE says: "A planet called Taujeer."
SHIRO says: ""Then that's where we're headed."
SHIRO says: "Everyone should get some sleep."
SHIRO says: "Tomorrow, we'll find that Galra fleet and take it out."
SHIRO says: ""Is everything okay?"
KEITH says: ""Yeah."
KEITH says: "Why?"
SHIRO says: ""You just seem a bit anxious."
KEITH says: ""I'm fine."
KEITH says: "Just tired."
KEITH says: "Like you said, I should get some sleep."
KEITH says: "Huh?"
KEITH says: "What's the matter, Red?"
KEITH says: "It's me."
ZARKON says: ""I can find you anywhere."
SHIRO says: ""Huh?"
SHIRO says: "Princess, what are you doing here?"
ALLURA says: ""Oh."
ALLURA says: "I might ask you the same thing."
ALLURA says: "Nothing."
ALLURA says: "Just walking."
ALLURA says: "Late at night."
ALLURA says: "Near the pods."
ALLURA says: ""In full Paladin armor, with a bag of your belongings?"
KEITH says: ""I have to know if Zarkon is tracking me."
KEITH says: "This is the only way."
KEITH says: "Don't try to stop me."
ALLURA says: ""I'm not going to stop you."
ALLURA says: "I'm going to join you."
CORAN says: ""We should be entering Taujeer's orbit soon."
SHIRO says: ""Raise the particle barrier."
SHIRO says: "Scan for Galra."
SHIRO says: "Where are Keith and Allura?"
CORAN says: ""It appears that one of the pods launched in the middle of the night."
LANCE says: ""Wait a minute, Keith and Allura?"
LANCE says: "In the middle of the night?"
LANCE says: "You don't think they're sittin' in a tree?"
SHIRO says: ""Contact the pod."
LANCE says: ""Yes!"
LANCE says: "Contact that pod!"
CORAN says: ""Princess, Keith, where are you?"
ALLURA says: ""Exactly where we should be, far away from the Castle."
SHIRO says: ""What?"
SHIRO says: "Why?"
ALLURA says: ""We must know if we are the ones Zarkon is tracking."
PIDGE says: ""They're isolating the variable."
PIDGE says: "Well, isolating two variables."
LANCE says: ""In English, please?"
LANCE says: ""I said English."
PIDGE says: ""Never mind!"
ALLURA says: ""Pidge is right."
ALLURA says: "If Zarkon finds you despite my absence, we will know with total certainty that we are not the ones he is tracking."
SHIRO says: ""Splitting up the group makes us far more vulnerable."
SHIRO says: "Come back to the Castle immediately."
ALLURA says: ""I'm sorry, Shiro, I cannot do that."
KEITH says: ""If Zarkon does find us, I can pilot us to safety."
KEITH says: "We're in wide-open space with plenty of room to maneuver."
KEITH says: "Plus, we'd be able to outrun him."
KEITH says: "Pidge added that booster rocket."
CORAN says: ""That thing's still on there?"
SHIRO says: ""We need both of you back here now!"
SHIRO says: "What's goin' on?"
HUNK says: ""We're in some sort of debris field."
CORAN says: ""I believe it's coming from Taujeer."
CORAN says: "Correction: I think it is Taujeer!"
CORAN says: ""Some kind of radiation from the planet is interfering with communications!"
SHIRO says: ""Move the Castle away from the planet and reestablish the link."
SHIRO says: "Everyone else, get to your lions."
TAUJEER says: ""Something's approaching!"
HUNK says: ""I don't see any Galra."
LANCE says: ""Looks like that fancy Galra finder doesn't work."
LANCE says: "Nice try, Pidge."
TAUJEER says: ""Thank goodness you're here!"
TAUJEER says: "I am Baujal, the leader of the Taujeerians."
TAUJEER says: "The Galra just destroyed our ship's engines and left."
PIDGE says: ""So the Galra were here."
PIDGE says: "Lance."
LANCE says: ""Mmm."
TAUJEER says: ""They've taken everything."
TAUJEER says: "We must get everyone off the planet before it dissolves completely!"
TAUJEER says: "Please, help us!"
SHIRO says: ""How long do we have?"
HUNK says: ""Not long."
SHIRO says: ""How did this happen?"
SHIRO says: "We've known for years that our planet would eventually lose its outer layer."
LANCE says: ""Like a snake shedding its skin?"
HUNK says: ""Yeah, yeah, that doesn't sound so bad."
HUNK says: "Beneath that old skin is a new, healthy layer, right?"
PIDGE says: ""Nope."
PIDGE says: "No, I I think the next layer is acid."
TAUJEER says: ""The plan was to evacuate the population to our nearest moon, where we have built a colony to wait out the shedding process."
TAUJEER says: "So we relocated to higher ground and constructed that ark."
LANCE says: ""What happened?"
TAUJEER says: ""The Galra attacked, led by a vile commander named Morvok."
TAUJEER says: "He robbed us of vital resources and left us with only one operational engine, stranding us here."
SHIRO says: ""You're not stranded anymore."
SHIRO says: "We will save your people."
TAUJEER says: ""I believe you, for I have heard many legends of the valor of Voltron."
TAUJEER says: "Five brave Paladins dedicated to this Wait, wait."
TAUJEER says: "I count only four of you."
TAUJEER says: "Are you not Voltron?"
LANCE says: ""Uh almost?"
TAUJEER says: ""Where is the fifth Paladin?"
SHIRO says: ""He's not here, but we can still help you."
TAUJEER says: ""I would feel more comfortable with all five Paladins."
SHIRO says: ""Duly noted."
SHIRO says: "Pidge, Hunk, take a look at the ark and see what we're dealing with."
HUNK says: ""Piece of cake."
HUNK says: "We'll get it flying in no time."
HUNK says: "Would you settle for upright?"
KEITH says: ""We've been here for hours."
KEITH says: "Still no sign of Zarkon."
ALLURA says: ""Well, I'm glad I don't have to wait here alone."
ALLURA says: "You understand, I could never live with myself if Zarkon was finding us because of me."
ALLURA says: "I must know."
ALLURA says: "We face such a dire threat from the Galra."
KEITH says: ""Well, sure, they're bad."
KEITH says: "No doubt about that."
KEITH says: "But at the same time, couldn't at least a few of them be fighting for good?"
KEITH says: "Just look at Ulaz."
KEITH says: "He sacrificed himself to save us."
ALLURA says: ""For all we know, his sacrifice was a ploy."
ALLURA says: "One life means nothing to Zarkon."
KEITH says: ""It means something to me."
KEITH says: "It means some of them are actually willing to help."
KEITH says: "And we could use all the help we can get!"
ALLURA says: ""Any offer of help from the Galra is merely a prelude to a trap."
ALLURA says: "I know all too well how quickly they turn."
KEITH says: ""It just seems crazy to lump everyone together."
ALLURA says: ""Listen, if there are any good Galra, they have had 10,000 years to take down Zarkon."
ALLURA says: "I would never count on them for help."
ZARKON says: ""I have located them."
ZARKON says: "Get me Morvok."
ZARKON says: ":Commander Morvok."
MARVOK says: ""Aaah!"
MARVOK says: "Lord Zarkon!"
MARVOK says: "I am sending you coordinates near your current location."
MARVOK says: "Voltron is there."
MARVOK says: "Find it and bring it to me."
MARVOK says: ""Voltron, sire?"
ZARKON says: ""Indeed."
ZARKON says: "Have you received the coordinates?"
MARVOK says: ""If I may, I was able to acquire many resources, all to glorify your mighty reign, may it last a thousand centuries."
ZARKON says: ""Your bootlicking does not impress me, Morvok."
ZARKON says: ""Are you refusing my order?"
MARVOK says: ""Of course not!"
MARVOK says: "I will not fail you, Lord Zarkon."
ZARKON says: ""See that you don't."
ZARKON says: "Vrepit sa."
MARVOK says: ""Vrepit sa."
PIDGE says: ""Assuming we can get it back up, the repairs will still take time."
LANCE says: ""Which would appear to be the one thing we don't have."
SHIRO says: ""We need to slow down the shedding."
PIDGE says: ""How do you stop a planet that's coming apart at the seams?"
HUNK says: ""By sewing it back together!"
SHIRO says: ""What do you mean?"
HUNK says: ""That new Green Lion weapon causes vegetation to grow, right?"
HUNK says: "Well, I was thinking that if you aim it at the cracks in the planet the vines could act like stitches."
SHIRO says: ""But won't the stitches get dissolved by the acid?"
PIDGE says: ""The stitches might hold longer if they're frozen."
SHIRO says: ""It's a plan."
SHIRO says: "Hunk, you and I will take our lions and get this ark upright while Pidge and Lance buy us some time."
HUNK says: ""My side's clear, Shiro."
SHIRO says: ""Almost done."
PIDGE says: ""Yes!"
PIDGE says: "It worked!"
SHIRO says: ""It won't hold forever."
SHIRO says: "Keep going!"
SHIRO says: "Come on!"
SHIRO says: "Give it all you got."
SHIRO says: "That's it!"
SHIRO says: "We're almost there."
SHIRO says: "Thanks, guys."
LANCE says: ""You got it."
PIDGE says: ""Anytime."
SHIRO says: ""All right, Hunk, time to work on those engines."
KEITH says: ""So, what happens if Zarkon does come after us?"
KEITH says: "You said you could pilot us to safety, right?"
KEITH says: "Sure, but after that, could we even go back to the group?"
KEITH says: "And if we don't, who would pilot the Castle or create wormholes?"
ALLURA says: ""Well, what about you?"
ALLURA says: "Without you, the team cannot form Voltron."
HUNK says: ""Well, it ain't pretty, but it should get you airborne Just in time."
PIDGE says: ""What was that?"
SHIRO says: ""The Galra."
SHIRO says: "They're back."
SHIRO says: ""Hunk!"
SHIRO says: "Take the Yellow Lion and hold up the ark."
SHIRO says: "If it falls into the acid, the Taujeerians are doomed."
HUNK says: ""Not to mention the guy beneath them."
HUNK says: "Which would be me, in this particular scenario."
SHIRO says: ""Lance, Pidge, we've got to draw the cruiser's fire."
SHIRO says: "Coran, we need you here now."
SHIRO says: "Attack the Galra cruiser!"
SHIRO says: ""I'm on my way!"
SHIRO says: "Keith, Allura, are you there?"
ALLURA says: ""We're here, Coran."
ALLURA says: "What is it?"
SHIRO says: ""Zarkon is definitely not tracking us through either of you."
KEITH says: ""He's not?"
ALLURA says: ""How do you know?"
CORAN says: ""Because you're out there, and a Galra fleet just showed up here!"
CORAN says: "We need you now!"
ALLURA says: ""We'll be there in two doboshes."
KEITH says: ""Even faster than that."
ALLURA says: ""What is that?"
KEITH says: ""It's the booster fuel Pidge added to this pod."
ALLURA says: ""Aaah!"
KEITH says: ""Aah!"
KEITH says: "Allura!"
KEITH says: "Grab my hand!"
KEITH says: "Princess, are you okay?"
ALLURA says: ""I believe so."
ALLURA says: "Is your radio still working?"
KEITH says: ""Let's find out."
KEITH says: "Coran, can you hear me?"
MARVOK says: ""This is going far better than I anticipated."
MARVOK says: "We could actually capture Voltron!"
MARVOK says: "I could get transferred back to the hub."
MARVOK says: "And they said I wasn't good enough to be in the hub."
MARVOK says: "Maybe Zarkon will invite me to sit in his box at the gladiator matches!"
MARVOK says: "The ultimate honor!"
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Sir!"
GALRA SOLDIER says: "Three Voltron Lions incoming!"
MARVOK says: ""Fire on them with our full arsenal!"
MARVOK says: "Keep firing!"
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Sir, the lions are moving too fast for us to hit."
MARVOK says: ""Well, let's make them stay in one place!"
MARVOK says: "Train the ion cannon on the ark."
MARVOK says: "Sink the entire thing into the acid!"
SHIRO says: ""They're aiming the ion cannon at the ark!"
SHIRO says: "Lance!"
SHIRO says: "Pidge!"
SHIRO says: "Attack the ship with your jaw blades!"
SHIRO says: "* KEITH: "We'll never get there at this rate."
ALLURA says: ""This was a terrible mistake."
ALLURA says: "Shiro was right."
ALLURA says: "We never should have left them."
HUNK says: ""Rocks!"
HUNK says: "Big, big rocks!"
LANCE says: ""We got you, buddy."
MARVOK says: ""What happened?"
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""The Black Lion attacked the cannon."
GALRA SOLDIER says: "He's disabled our projectile guidance system."
GALRA SOLDIER says: "We won't be able to aim the cannon until it's fixed."
MARVOK says: ""Fix it!"
MARVOK says: "Full attack!"
MARVOK says: "Fire with everything we've got!"
SHIRO says: ""Way to go, Coran!"
SHIRO says: "Hunk, what's your status?"
HUNK says: ""Mostly just trying not to fall into a bubbling pot of acid."
MARVOK says: ""Divert all shields to the main hull!"
MARVOK says: "Focus full firepower on their ship!"
LANCE says: ""We're being overwhelmed!"
PIDGE says: ""We need Voltron!"
CORAN says: ""Oh, if only there were another who could pilot the Red Lion."
CORAN says: "Finally, Alfor."
CORAN says: "I will walk in your footsteps!"
CORAN says: "Oh, Red Lion, I am unworthy to be your Paladin, but since you have chosen to bestow this honor upon me, Coran Hieronymus Wimbleton Smythe, I humbly accept."
CORAN says: ""Oh, yes!"
CORAN says: "Right."
CORAN says: "Okay."
CORAN says: "Just a quick lap."
CORAN says: "Uh, okay, guys?"
CORAN says: "So, yeah the the Red Lion ran away."
HUNK says: ""I can't hold it any longer!"
HUNK says: "Hunk, you have to!"
HUNK says: "If you let go, the Taujeerians will die!"
HUNK says: "Oh, whoa!"
HUNK says: "Armor claws!"
HUNK says: "Guys, I can keep this thing from falling any farther but I need your help to get it back up."
SHIRO says: ""We're on our way!"
ALLURA says: ""Keith, look!"
KEITH says: ""Huh?"
ALLURA says: ""The Red Lion found you!"
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Sir, the ion cannon's guidance system is back online."
GALRA SOLDIER says: "And the lions appear to have gathered beneath the ark."
MARVOK says: ""Perfect!"
MARVOK says: "The lions will go down with it."
MARVOK says: "Fire when ready!"
MARVOK says: "All right!"
SHIRO says: ""Good to have you back, Keith."
KEITH says: ""Good to be back."
LANCE says: ""Is the Princess with you?"
KEITH says: ""Yes."
LANCE says: ""Like "with you" with you, or Uh, Keith?"
LANCE says: "Little help?"
LANCE says: "On my way, buddy."
SHIRO says: ""All right, everybody."
SHIRO says: "No time to relax."
SHIRO says: "Let's show them what they're dealing with."
SHIRO says: "Form Voltron!"
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Sir, our weapons systems are knocked out completely."
GALRA SOLDIER says: "Should we retreat?"
MARVOK says: ""Never!"
MARVOK says: "Aim the ship at the ark!"
MARVOK says: "We will take it down ourselves."
MARVOK says: "To die for the Galra Empire is the greatest honor imaginable."
MARVOK says: "Vrepit sa!"
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Vrepit sa!"
MARVOK says: ""Prepare my escape pod."
PIDGE says: ""They're heading for the ark!"
HUNK says: ""They're gonna ram it!"
SHIRO says: ""We'll have to meet them head-on."
SHIRO says: "Form sword!"
LANCE says: ""Will the sword be able to cut through an entire battle cruiser?"
SHIRO says: ""It'll have to!"
KEITH says: ""Guys, I think my lion is telling me something."
LANCE says: ""Yeah, mine too."
PIDGE says: ""I can feel it too."
HUNK says: ""Same here."
SHIRO says: ""Then do it!"
HUNK says: ""Yes!"
PIDGE says: ""Yeah!"
KEITH says: ""Now let's get the Taujeerians to safety."
HUNK says: ""How are we going to do that?"
HUNK says: "Their booster rockets are shot."
ALLURA says: ""I'm so sorry for leaving."
KEITH says: ""Me too."
KEITH says: "We thought we were doing the right thing."
ALLURA says: ""But clearly you were correct, Shiro."
ALLURA says: "We are always stronger together."
LANCE says: ""At least we learned that Zarkon isn't tracking us through you two."
HUNK says: ""Plus, I learned that my lion can grow armor and extend its claws like that Ting!"
HUNK says: "Which will come in handy if we ever needed to, say, I don't know, slice up a giant steak while getting beat up."
HUNK says: "Or fight evil and save innocent people."
HUNK says: "That too."
HUNK says: "That would work."
SHIRO says: ""The fact that the Red Lion came to help Keith from so far away is a vital piece of information."
SHIRO says: "We now have proof that a lion and a Paladin can, in fact, connect over a far greater distance than we realized."
SHIRO says: "Which means we finally know how Zarkon is tracking us."
SHIRO says: "It's through the Black Lion."
