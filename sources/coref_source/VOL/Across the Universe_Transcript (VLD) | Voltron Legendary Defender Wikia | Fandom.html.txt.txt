PIDGE says: ""What just happened?"
HUNK says: ""Who cares?"
HUNK says: "Wormhole!"
Allura opens up a Wormhole but a moment after, Haggar corrupts it with her sorcery by blasting a beam of Galra energy.
The Castle of Lions struggles to keep its balance in the unstable temporal rift.
SHIRO says: ""Coran, what's happening?"
CORAN says: ""The integrity of the wormhole has been compromised."
CORAN says: "It's breaking down!"
LANCE says: ""What does that mean?"
CORAN says: ""It means we have no control over where we're headed!"
The hanger doors suddenly open and all the Lions are pulled into the vortex, being separated from one another.
LANCE says: ""Keith!"
LANCE says: "Shiro!"
All the Lions vanish as the Castle of Lions goes in a time loop. ".
ALLURA says: ""They've vanished through the temporal rift!"
ALLURA says: "The lions are gone!"
KEITH says: ""Come on, come on, come on!"
Keith and Shiro struggle to keep their Lions at course as they crash land towards an unknown planet.
KEITH says: ""You okay, Red?"
KEITH says: "Okay."
KEITH says: "We'll fix you up."
KEITH says: "We had a tough battle."
Keith climbs his Lion to see a desolate land.
KEITH says: ""Where are we?"
KEITH says: "Where have we landed?"
Keith gasps.
KEITH says: ""Shiro."
KEITH says: "Shiro!"
Screen switches to Pidge as she crash lands towards what seems to be rings made out of broken up technology.
PIDGE says: ""Whoa!"
PIDGE says: ""Huh?"
PIDGE says: "What's the matter, girl?"
PIDGE says: ""Okay, rest a bit."
PIDGE says: "I'll see what I can do."
PIDGE says: ""Looks like there's no gravity here."
PIDGE says: "It's like a trash nebula of some kind."
PIDGE says: "Okay, Pidge, stay calm."
PIDGE says: "You know what they say."
PIDGE says: ""When you get lost in space, the best thing to do is stay put and wait for people to find you."
PIDGE says: "" This'll be nice."
PIDGE says: "I'll have some "me" time..."
PIDGE says: "No one to annoy me."
CORAN says: ""Let's check the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor to see where this wormhole is taking us."
ALLURA says: ""Coran, look!"
ALLURA says: "There appears to be something on the other end."
ALLURA says: "We're heading right toward it!"
CORAN says: ""Scanners show that there's no exit."
CORAN says: "It's just nothingness."
CORAN says: "Find an exit before we run smack into the void!"
ALLURA says: ""I can't."
ALLURA says: "I've lost control of the Castle."
CORAN says: ""Brace yourself!"
CORAN says: "We're about to hit it!"
CORAN says: ""Let's check the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor to see where this wormhole is taking us."
ALLURA says: ""Coran, we're okay!"
CORAN says: ""What are you talking about?"
CORAN says: "We've lost all the lions!"
ALLURA says: ""We've just smashed into a black void."
ALLURA says: "Don't you remember?"
ALLURA says: "Hmm?"
ALLURA says: ""What happened to the mice?"
ALLURA says: "They've transformed."
ALLURA says: ""Coran?"
CORAN says: ""Why are you looking at me like that?"
CORAN says: "Do I have a boogie stuck in my mustache again?"
ALLURA says: ""No."
ALLURA says: "You look younger."
CORAN says: ""Scanners show that there's no exit."
CORAN says: "It's just nothingness!"
ALLURA says: ""You said that already!"
CORAN says: ""Find an exit before we run smack into the void!"
ALLURA says: ""I'm entering coordinates to get us out of here."
ALLURA says: ""The Castle won't accept an end point."
CORAN says: ""Just enter any coordinates!"
ALLURA says: ""I tried, but the system is locked."
ALLURA says: "I can't get a signal out or receive a signal in."
CORAN says: ""Allura!"
CORAN says: ""Let's check the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor to see where this wormhole is taking us."
ALLURA says: ""Oh, no!"
ALLURA says: "You're even younger now!"
CORAN says: ""What's the matter?"
CORAN says: "You look confused."
CORAN says: "Don't worry, Princess, I'll get us out of here."
ALLURA says: ""We appear to be in some sort of time loop that's affecting everyone but me."
CORAN says: ""Scanners show that there's no exit."
ALLURA says: ""Nothingness, I know."
ALLURA says: "And we can't find another exit point."
CORAN says: ""Don't just stand there."
CORAN says: "We've got to find a way."
CORAN says: "I'll never give in to nothingness!"
SHIRO says: ""Keith, are you there?"
SHIRO says: "Keith?"
SHIRO says: ""I've got to get to higher ground."
KEITH says: ""Shiro, can you hear me?"
KEITH says: "Shiro?"
KEITH says: ""Shiro, are you there?"
KEITH says: "Answer me!"
SHIRO says: ""Keith."
SHIRO says: "I'm here."
SHIRO says: "Keith."
KEITH says: ""Shiro, it's Keith."
SHIRO says: ""Keith, Keith, I'm here."
SHIRO says: "I'm okay."
KEITH says: ""Shiro, you made it."
SHIRO says: ""It takes more than a glowing alien wound, a fall from the upper atmosphere, and crashing into a hard pan surface, at what I'm guessing is about 25 meters per second squared, to get rid of me."
SHIRO says: "How are you?"
KEITH says: ""Not good."
KEITH says: "My lion's busted."
KEITH says: "Wait, what wound?"
SHIRO says: ""It's nothing."
KEITH says: ""Hang on, I'm coming."
SHIRO says: ""On second thought, you'd better hurry."
Screen switches to Pidge.
PIDGE says: ""Who's there?"
PIDGE says: ""Hmm?"
PIDGE says: "Aw!"
PIDGE says: "Hey, little guys!"
PIDGE says: "Aw, you guys are so cute."
PIDGE says: "Too cute to be found in a dump like this."
PIDGE says: "Are you guys the only ones living here?"
PIDGE says: "I hope my rough landing didn't disturb your day."
PIDGE says: "I'll only be here for a short time."
PIDGE says: "I'm waiting for my friends to find me."
PIDGE says: "We were separated during a wormhole jump."
PIDGE says: ""Yeah, friends!"
PIDGE says: "I sure hope they find me soon."
CORAN says: ""Let's check the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor to see where this wormhole is taking us."
CORAN says: ""This is so boring."
ALLURA says: ""Coran, please!"
ALLURA says: "I don't need any of your attitude right now."
CORAN says: ""You don't understand me at all!"
CORAN says: "You have no idea what I'm going through!"
CORAN says: "I'll be in my control area!"
CORAN says: "Hmmph!"
ALLURA says: ""I can't manually enter coordinates."
ALLURA says: "But the Castle will automatically lock on to the lions' whereabouts, if we can locate them."
ALLURA says: ""It's not working!"
ALLURA says: "I'm unable to hone in on their location."
ALLURA says: ""Coran, turn that down!"
ALLURA says: "Our lives are at stake!"
CORAN says: ""I can only express myself through music!"
CORAN says: ""And what?"
CORAN says: "We're just gonna run into this void that's coming up here."
CORAN says: "I hate everybody!"
CORAN says: ""Let's check the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor to see where this wormhole is taking us, whatever that means."
ALLURA says: ""We've tried everything and nothing's worked."
ALLURA says: "A few more trips down this wormhole and you're going to disappear."
ALLURA says: "We must find a way out."
CORAN says: ""Just blast your way out!"
CORAN says: "Duh!"
ALLURA says: ""I suppose it's worth a try."
ALLURA says: "The Castle defenses might have enough firepower to destroy the tunnel."
CORAN says: ""Yeah!"
CORAN says: "And it'll go ker-plooey!"
ALLURA says: ""It's not working!"
ALLURA says: "It's like we're shooting at ourselves."
Coran blows raspberry.
CORAN says: ""Where's Voltron?"
Scene switches to Keith, as he flies towards Shiro with his jetpack.
KEITH says: ""Shiro, what happened?"
SHIRO says: ""There's several creatures."
Scene switches to Shiro as a monster creeps behind him.
SHIRO says: ""Huh?"
KEITH says: ""Uh-oh."
SHIRO says: ""Keith, are you okay?"
SHIRO says: "What happened?"
KEITH says: ""Minor delay, but I'm on my way."
KEITH says: "How are you?"
SHIRO says: ""I'm all right, but I'm trapped in a cave, and some nasty-looking creatures have me cornered."
KEITH says: ""Stay put."
KEITH says: "I'm on my way."
KEITH says: "I just have to..."
KEITH says: "figure this out."
PIDGE says: ""My name is Keith."
PIDGE says: "I'm so emo."
PIDGE says: ""Shiro, you're our leader."
PIDGE says: "What should we do?"
PIDGE says: ""We'll get through this if we work together."
PIDGE says: "We're a team."
PIDGE says: ""Look at me!"
PIDGE says: "I'm Lance."
PIDGE says: "Hey, is that a cute girl over there?"
PIDGE says: ""I don't feel good."
PIDGE says: "The smell of this place makes me want to barf."
PIDGE says: ""Paladins, please."
PIDGE says: "We must defeat Zarkon."
PIDGE says: ""Blah, blah, blah!"
PIDGE says: "Crazy words."
PIDGE says: "Mustache."
PIDGE says: ""Huh?"
PIDGE says: "What is it?"
PIDGE says: ""Hey, you're working again!"
PIDGE says: "Welcome back!"
PIDGE says: ""No, it's not my friends."
PIDGE says: "It's just an old, rusty satellite."
PIDGE says: "Hey!"
PIDGE says: "Maybe I can find my friends before they find me."
Scene switches back to Shiro and Keith.
KEITH says: ""Patience yields focus."
SHIRO says: ""That really stayed with you, didn't it?"
KEITH says: ""You've given me some good advice."
KEITH says: "If it wasn't for you, my life would have been a lot different."
SHIRO says: ""Yeah."
SHIRO says: "You wouldn't have crashed a flying lion on an alien planet and be stuck with little hope of rescue."
SHIRO says: "So, you're welcome."
KEITH says: ""Stay with me, Shiro."
SHIRO says: ""Keith!"
SHIRO says: "Keith!"
KEITH says: ""Hang on."
KEITH says: "I'm on my way."
SHIRO says: ""Good, because these guys just started digging."
KEITH says: ""Shiro, I have a visual on the Black Lion."
Shiro gets snagged by one of the creatures and is thrown away. He tries to defend himself but receives more injuries.
SHIRO says: ""Shiro, what happened?"
Scene switches to Allura and Coran.
CORAN says: ""Let's check the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor to see where this worm goes."
CORAN says: "I hungy."
ALLURA says: ""Coran, no!"
ALLURA says: "That is not a toy."
ALLURA says: "You're going to break the Castle and everything will stop!"
ALLURA says: "Wait a second."
ALLURA says: "Perhaps we can simply stop the Castle from moving."
CORAN says: ""No!"
CORAN says: "Mine!"
ALLURA says: ""I've shut down all the power."
ALLURA says: ""Why are we still moving towards the void?"
CORAN says: ""My control panel!"
ALLURA says: ""I know, I know."
ALLURA says: "Who wants to check the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor to see where this wormhole is taking us?"
ALLURA says: "You do, that's who."
ALLURA says: "We have to get out of this loop before the only thing left of you is your mustache."
CORAN says: ""Poopies."
KEITH says: ""I know I'm not Shiro, but he's in trouble."
KEITH says: "We need to help him."
PIDGE says: ""That ought to do it."
PIDGE says: "Now, let's see if we can get a hold of the Castle."
PIDGE says: ""No, no!"
PIDGE says: "What's wrong?"
PIDGE says: "I need to get out of here!"
PIDGE says: "I need to find my friends!"
PIDGE says: "Come on!"
The Green Lion channels its energy to the satellite.
PIDGE says: ""Thanks."
PIDGE says: ""Now, let's see if this thing works."
PIDGE says: "I hope the signal's strong enough to reach the Castle."
ALLURA says: ""Coran, what are we going to do?"
ALLURA says: "If we hit the end of the tunnel again, you'll cease to exist."
ALLURA says: "I'm sorry."
ALLURA says: "You were like a second father to me."
ALLURA says: ""Coran, look!"
ALLURA says: "The Castle has locked onto a coordinate."
ALLURA says: ""Come on."
ALLURA says: "Come on!"
ALLURA says: ""We made it!"
CORAN says: ""Mm?"
CORAN says: "Mom?"
ALLURA says: ""You saved us, Pidge."
ALLURA says: "We were stuck in a time loop."
CORAN says: ""You got us out with this giant trash pile."
PIDGE says: ""It's a make-shift communications link that sends out the Green Lion energy."
PIDGE says: "It's similar to the energy that guided the Blue Lion home."
CORAN says: ""Pidge, you're a genius!"
PIDGE says: ""I know."
PIDGE says: "Besides, it wasn't just me."
PIDGE says: "They helped."
CORAN says: ""Hmm."
ALLURA says: ""Let's go get the rest of the paladins."
SHIRO says: ""Thanks for saving me."
KEITH says: ""You'd have done the same for me."
SHIRO says: ""How's your wound?"
SHIRO says: "My wound's great."
SHIRO says: "It's getting bigger all the time."
SHIRO says: "Just trying to lighten the mood."
KEITH says: ""Hang in there."
KEITH says: "When Allura and Coran find us, they'll fix you right up."
SHIRO says: ""Keith, if I don't make it out of here I want you to lead Voltron."
KEITH says: ""Stop talking like that."
KEITH says: "You're gonna make it."
KEITH says: ""Huh?"
ZARKON says: ""Explain to me how you let Voltron escape."
PROROK says: ""Perhaps it was a mechanical failure, sire."
PROROK says: "Haggar boosted the solar barrier's power beyond its normal limits."
HAGGAR says: ""This was no mechanical failure."
HAGGAR says: "The two sentries that were guarding the barrier control were found destroyed."
HAGGAR says: "This was clearly sabotage."
PROROK says: ""Lord Zarkon, I will start an investigation immediately."
PROROK says: "I will not rest until the perpetrators are captured."
ZARKON says: ""Perhaps I can save months of investigating."
ZARKON says: "Who has been trying to chisel Voltron away from me this entire time?"
ZARKON says: "Who sent his fleet out without my orders to get Voltron?"
PROROK says: ""Sire, no!"
PROROK says: "I-I would never do that."
ZARKON says: ""Get rid of him."
PROROK says: ""No!"
PROROK says: "I'm innocent!"
HAGGAR says: ""Before we dispose of him, the druids will find out all that he knows."
HAGGAR says: "Then, he will receive a punishment worse than death."
ZARKON says: ""Lieutenant Thace You are now in charge of the investigation Commander."
THACE says: ""Vrepit sa."
