ALLURA says: ""Somewhere inside Sendak's memories we should be able to find the inside information that gives us the key to take down Zarkon."
CORAN says: ""I don't think your father would approve of searching through an enemy's memories."
ALLURA says: ""I know, but we have to do everything we can to defeat Zarkon."
LANCE says: ""Once we learn all his weaknesses, we can drive up to his front door and challenge him to a fight."
LANCE says: "Winner gets the universe."
SHIRO says: ""Anything good yet, Pidge?"
PIDGE says: ""We were only able to salvage bits and pieces."
KEITH says: ""We need something to work with."
KEITH says: "Right now, we don't even have a decent map of the empire."
LANCE says: ""Who needs a map?"
LANCE says: "After 10,000 years of conquering, I could probably fire my bayard at like any random point in space and hit a Galra ship."
SHIRO says: ""If we could just find troop locations or supply routes, small targets we could hit-and-run, then we could start to free planets one by one."
LANCE says: ""Boring."
LANCE says: "I want the big kaboom."
SHIRO says: ""Zarkon's been building his empire for 10,000 years."
SHIRO says: "We're not going to tear it down overnight with five inexperienced pilots and one support ship."
SHIRO says: "Hitting him where he lives would be a huge mistake."
PIDGE says: ""Okay, I've cross-referenced Sendak's memories with the info I got from the downed ship back on Arus."
PIDGE says: "Most of it was a garbled mess, but one thing kept repeating, something called a "Universal Station."
HUNK says: ""Universal Station?"
HUNK says: "Like, the kind of station that controls the entire universe?"
PIDGE says: ""Well, we are translating it from Galra, so it could also be "Galactic Hub."
LANCE says: ""Or "Space Base"!"
LANCE says: ""What?"
CORAN says: ""I'm pulling up the location of your Universal Hub Station Base on our screens now."
LANCE says: ""So, where is it?"
CORAN says: ""I don't know."
CORAN says: "Our long-range sensors are unable to find anything at those coordinates."
KEITH says: ""Maybe he remembered it wrong."
PIDGE says: ""Or maybe we just stumbled across a top-secret base in Sendak's memories."
ALLURA says: ""Only one way to find out."
ALLURA says: "Let's go take a look."
Princess Joins The Fray.
Hunk snores.
ALLURA says: "We should be close enough to get a good scan, but far enough away to avoid being noticed."
SHIRO says: "There it is."
CORAN says: ""It appears the gravitation between the two planets warps the electron emission spectrum enough to keep the planet off the deep space scanners."
PIDGE says: ""So, you can only see it if you really know where to look."
SHIRO says: ""This place must handle shipments from all over the Galra Empire."
PIDGE says: ""If this is some big airport where shipments come and go, why is it hidden?"
SHIRO says: ""There must be more to this than we're seeing."
ALLURA says: ""Then, we'd better go down to take a look."
ALLURA says: "We'll need to enter here: the central control building."
KEITH says: ""I'm sorry, Princess, did you say "we"?"
ALLURA says: ""I'm going with you."
ALLURA says: "I've traveled through the Galra transportation hubs many times with my father before the war began."
ALLURA says: "I know more about them than any of you."
CORAN says: ""Princess, I'd rather you stay here."
ALLURA says: ""I'm a part of this fight against Zarkon as much as anyone."
ALLURA says: "I'm going."
ALLURA says: "Does anyone have a problem with that?"
CORAN says: "Uh..."
Lance whistles while Coran stammers.
SHIRO says: ""Fine."
SHIRO says: "Suit up."
EVERYONE says: "Huh?"
SHIRO says: ""We'll go in low, fast, and hopefully undetected."
SHIRO says: "Coming around the dark side of the nearest planet should keep them from getting a visual on us."
SHIRO says: "Thanks to Pidge's modifications to the Green Lion, we'll have 30 seconds of cloaking."
CORAN says: ""I can flood their short-range sensors with a radiation burst."
CORAN says: "That should buy you a minute or so, while they assume it's cosmic interference."
CORAN says: "But, after that, it's up to you to be out of sight."
Xenomorphasis.
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""male voice: Interference clear in three, two, one."
Galra Soldier yawns.
SHIRO says: ""Psst!"
SHIRO says: "Hey!"
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Hmm?"
Shots.
SHIRO says: ""How's it look out there?"
KEITH says: ""All clear."
HUNK says: ""This shouldn't take too long."
PIDGE says: ""We'll have all the information we need in a few minutes."
Computer starts beeping.
PIDGE says: ""Hunk and I have made some improvements since the last time I tried to download Galra info."
PIDGE says: "We should get a nice, clean translation immediately."
PIDGE says: "Hunk had a great idea about how to do it."
HUNK says: ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, do you guys remember when we studied algorithms at the Garrison, and Mr."
HUNK says: "York told us that joke about the ghost learning symbolic logic and innumerably infinite sets?"
LANCE says: ""Boring!"
HUNK says: ""Right, yeah, totally, it was boring."
HUNK says: "Anyway, the joke goes..."
KEITH says: ""Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt, but I think we got company."
KEITH says: ""Think we should get out of here?"
PIDGE says: ""We just need a few more seconds."
SHIRO says: ""Stay low."
SHIRO says: "We need this intel."
KEITH says: ""Get down!"
The team hastily scatters, ducking under consoles.
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Huh?"
LANCE says: ""He's still looking."
LANCE says: "I think he's waiting for a signal or something."
HUNK says: ""I got it."
HUNK says: ""Whew."
LANCE says: ""Nice job, Hunk."
HUNK says: ""Thanks."
PIDGE says: ""Okay, download complete."
KEITH says: ""What's it say?"
KEITH says: "Nothing."
KEITH says: "This place doesn't have any useful information."
KEITH says: "Just a schedule of the ships coming in and out."
LANCE says: ""Well, I guess this mission was a bust."
SHIRO says: ""Let's get back to the Castle."
ALLURA says: ""Hold on."
ALLURA says: "Pidge, do you know where that ship is headed?"
PIDGE says: ""Um, it's scheduled to be here for about a half an hour, then head off to Central Command."
ALLURA says: ""That's where they have the information we need, and I'm going to sneak aboard that ship and get it for us."
LANCE says: ""What?"
LANCE says: "No way!"
KEITH says: ""How are you going to get in?"
ALLURA says: ""I'm going to walk right through the front."
Allura transforms.
HUNK says: ""How the heck did you do that?"
ALLURA says: ""The Alteans are a chameleon-like people who can blend in with the local populations."
ALLURA says: "It's the ability that's made us great explorers and diplomats throughout our history."
LANCE says: ""So, can you turn into, like, a balloon?"
PIDGE says: ""How many different colors can you be at once?"
HUNK says: ""Aren't you afraid you'll rip your pants?"
ALLURA says: ""No, just one at a time, and I will need a change of costume."
ALLURA says: "I can use his uniform as a disguise."
SHIRO says: ""I can't let you go in there alone."
ALLURA says: ""Excuse me?"
ALLURA says: "I do not need your permission."
SHIRO says: ""It's too dangerous."
SHIRO says: "I'm going in with you."
SHIRO says: "You will stick out like a Shoferiak's nose."
PIDGE says: ""You're going to need that nose, Princess."
PIDGE says: "Shiro's hand is made from Galra tech."
PIDGE says: "It's the only thing we have that will allow us to interface with their systems and gather intel."
PIDGE says: "I can monitor the download remotely from here."
ALLURA says: ""Fine, you can come."
HUNK says: ""Uh, you guys better hurry up if you want to get on and off before the ship leaves for Zarkon central."
KEITH says: ""How are you going to get Shiro on board?"
Collection.
Sporks.
Allura is in Galra armor carrying a box. Shiro is curled up inside the box with a resigned expression. Allura approaches the ship.
GALRA SENTRY says: ""Halt."
A floating bed of canisters passes down the ramp and into the depot.
GALRA SENTRY says: ""Move along."
ALLURA says: ""Whew."
LANCE says: ""They're in."
KEITH says: ""What do you think they have in all those giant containers?"
HUNK says: "Well, I suspect that it's sporks."
HUNK says: ""What?"
HUNK says: "This is an advanced race we're talking about here."
HUNK says: "Surely, they've learned that it's foolish to have forks and spoons when one tool will efficiently do the job."
PIDGE says: ""Maybe this guy will tell us."
PIDGE says: "What is coming in and out of this station?"
GALRA DRONE says: ""Interrogation detected."
GALRA DRONE says: "Initiating lockdown."
PIDGE says: ""Not talking, eh?"
KEITH says: ""Whoa."
KEITH says: "Check out this guy."
KEITH says: "Whatever's happening here that requires the base to be kept secret must have something to do with that scary dude."
KEITH says: "I'm going to go check it out."
LANCE says: ""How about we just lay low and you don't blow our cover?"
LANCE says: ""Keith, think about what you're doing."
LANCE says: "Don't walk through that door!"
LANCE says: ""I think I told him."
PIDGE says: ""You are a paragon of leadership, Lance."
Timing.
ALLURA says: ""Shiro, are you all right?"
SHIRO says: ""I just remembered how I escaped from the Galra prison ship."
SHIRO says: "Listen, most of the ship's personnel are sentries."
ALLURA says: ""So?"
SHIRO says: ""When I was a prisoner, I timed their pattern."
ALLURA says: ""Do you remember it?"
SHIRO says: ""Let's find out."
Queried Infatuation.
LANCE says: "" Why are you hitting yourself?"
LANCE says: "Stop hitting yourself!"
LANCE says: "Quit hitting yourself!"
PIDGE says: ""Stop torturing it, Hunk."
HUNK says: ""I'm sorry."
HUNK says: "I just..."
HUNK says: "I need something to keep me busy, so I'm not worried about Keith getting caught, or Shiro and Allura getting blasted by robot things, or someone finding us here, like, right now..."
PIDGE says: ""Stop it, Hunk!"
PIDGE says: "I think we can teach it to help us."
PIDGE says: "Would you like to help us, Mr."
PIDGE says: "Robot?"
HUNK says: ""Whoops."
LANCE says: ""Quick question."
LANCE says: "Does Allura talk about me when I'm not in the room?"
HUNK says: ""Oh, yeah, all the time."
LANCE says: ""Really?"
HUNK says: ""Yeah, yeah."
HUNK says: "She's all like, "Oh, Lance."
HUNK says: "He looks so fine."
HUNK says: "I'm all atwitter."
HUNK says: "" Then, she turns red and she makes me swear not to tell anyone."
LANCE says: ""I knew it!"
The Galra drone hits Lance.
PIDGE says: ""Whoops."
Plyrox.
On the Ship.
SHIRO says: ""We only have a few minutes before the next patrol comes by."
SHIRO says: "Watch the door."
ALLURA says: ""Got it."
SHIRO says: ""Okay, Pidge, start the download."
PIDGE says: ""Generating access code."
PIDGE says: ""We're in."
SHIRO says: ""Pidge, I think there's a problem."
PIDGE says: ""Sit tight."
PIDGE says: "I'm trying to work around this."
COMPUTER says: ""Scanning for information."
SHIRO says: "Pidge?"
PIDGE says: ""I'm on it, I'm on it!"
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""What's going on here?"
GALRA SOLDIER says: "Who are you?"
ALLURA says: ""It's about time you got here."
ALLURA says: "Where is the rest of your squad?"
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Uh, what squad?"
SHIRO says: "" Hurry up, Pidge."
PIDGE says: ""Almost there."
ALLURA says: ""The squad that is to escort me and my associate to our ship."
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Who's back there?"
GALRA SOLDIER says: "What's going on?"
ALLURA says: ""We are part of Zarkon's high command."
ALLURA says: "Our work must not be disturbed."
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Where's Chief Information Officer Plytox?"
ALLURA says: ""Uh, he's in there."
ALLURA says: "Say hello, Plyrox."
SHIRO says: ""Uh..."
SHIRO says: "Uh.."
SHIRO says: "It's "Plytox"!"
ALLURA says: ""Oh, sorry."
ALLURA says: "See?"
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Oh."
GALRA SOLDIER says: "Vrepit sa, sir!"
GALRA SOLDIER says: "I get his name wrong all the time, too."
ALLURA says: ""Whew."
Extraction.
Quintessence Collection.
KEITH says: ""Coran, you need to see this."
CORAN says: ""I've never seen anything like it."
PIDGE says: ""What is that?"
Mr. Robot beeps.
MR. ROBOT says: ""The material is quintessence, the substance with the highest known energy per unit volume in the universe."
LANCE says: ""Hey, nice job, Pidge!"
LANCE says: "You made him work for us."
CORAN says: ""What?"
CORAN says: "Impossible."
MR. ROBOT says: ""Raw quintessence material is transported here from throughout the galaxy and refined into standardized Galra fuel requirements."
PIDGE says: ""Did you guys hear that?"
CORAN says: ""I can't believe it!"
CORAN says: "They've found a new way acquire quintessence!"
KEITH says: ""Guys, I'm going to steal some of this quint-whatever."
Princess Issues A Promotion.
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Um..."
ALLURA says: ""Huh?"
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Do you think I could get assigned to Zarkon's unit?"
GALRA SOLDIER says: "Nothing happens on this ship."
ALLURA says: ""Oh, well, I don't know."
ALLURA says: "What's your bloodthirstiness on a scale of one to five?"
ALLURA says: "One being "No, thanks, I'm full," and five being "Unquenchable."
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Hmm..."
GALRA SOLDIER says: "If I'm being honest, about a three."
ALLURA says: ""We can work on that."
Alarm blares.
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Huh?"
ALLURA says: ""Huh?"
COMPUTER says: ""computer: Fugitive prisoner 117-9875 detected."
COMPUTER says: "Remain where you are."
COMPUTER says: "Security alerted."
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Uh, help!"
GALRA SOLDIER says: "Intruders!"
SHIRO says: ""I think we're in trouble."
ALLURA says: ""You think?"
Allura rams the Galra Soldier into the wall, creating a dent, embedding his helmet into a wall and knocking him unconscious. Allura yanks his weapon out of his hand. Shiro gapes.
ALLURA says: ""What?"
Galra Drones walk towards them.
SHIRO says: ""Let's go!"
Keith Vs. Druid.
Keith steals a cylinder of Quintessence.
KEITH says: ""Mm?"
KEITH says: ""Okay, plan B!"
Druid strikes lightning upon Keith.
KEITH says: ""Pidge, I need an extraction now!"
KEITH says: "Hurry!"
SHIRO says: ""Pidge, fire up the Green Lion!"
SHIRO says: "We're coming in hot!"
Princess Seized.
Galra drones attack, Allura fires the weapon the wrong way, hitting a patrol behind them.
ALLURA says: ""What?"
SHIRO says: ""I thought you said you'd traveled around the galaxy."
SHIRO says: "I mean, you fly a spaceship."
SHIRO says: "How could you possibly not know how to hold this correctly?"
ALLURA says: ""I'm tense!"
ALLURA says: "This is a tense situation."
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""Secure hatches."
GALRA SOLDIER says: "All personnel take positions for departure."
ALLURA says: ""Let's move!"
PIDGE says: ""Get in!"
PIDGE says: "We've got to get Shiro and Allura!"
KEITH says: ""Huh?"
SHIRO says: ""The escape pods are up here!"
GALRA SOLDIER says: ""male voice: Formulating navigation."
GALRA SOLDIER says: "All crew assume secure hyper-speed positions."
ALLURA says: ""Hurry!"
ALLURA says: "We can't leave once the ship goes into hyper-speed!"
ALLURA says: ""It's taking off!"
ALLURA says: "Get in the pod!"
SHIRO says: ""I'm not leaving you!"
ALLURA says: ""You have to!"
SHIRO says: ""No!"
Allura throws him - one handed into the pod. The Galra drones break through the door and capture her. The ship jumps into hyperspace. Shiro arrives on the Green Lion to confused looks.
KEITH says: ""Where's Allura?"
LANCE says: ""Shiro?"
SHIRO says: ""She sacrificed herself to save me."
PIDGE says: ""So, she's still on that ship?"
HUNK says: ""The ship that's headed to Zarkon's Central Command?"
KEITH says: ""The place that's way too dangerous for us to attack?"
SHIRO says: ""It doesn't matter how dangerous it is."
SHIRO says: "We can't let Zarkon get Allura."
HUNK says: ""But you said going there would be a huge mistake."
HUNK says: "You said for us to attack that place head-on would be the dumbest possible thing we could ever do."
SHIRO says: ""I know, but now we don't have a choice."
