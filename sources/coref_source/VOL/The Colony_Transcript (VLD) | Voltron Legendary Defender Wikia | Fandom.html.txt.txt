Hunk says: "Then they have to make it out again?"
Coran says: "I agree with Hunk."
Coran says: "This plan is a foolhardy and unnecessary risk."
Pidge says: "I don't know."
Pidge says: "I mean, we've traveled through the quintessence field to another reality."
Pidge says: "This isn't just theoretical physics; mathematically, we know it's possible."
Coran says: "Well, it is hard to argue with math."
Coran says: "Believe me, I've tried."
Lance says: "But even if they do reach the quintessence field, then what?"
Lance says: "The last time anyone got in there, it turned Zarkon evil."
Coran says: "Lance makes a fine point!"

Coran says: "What?"
Coran says: "That's impossible!"
Coran says: "Altea was destroyed!"
Coran says: "Allura and I were the only survivors!"

Hunk says: "Man, Lotor is even nicer than we thought."
Dissolve through stills showing the landscape evolving and new structures being built, including a massive statue of Lotor.
Romelle says: "And over time, the Alteans came to worship Lotor as their savior."
Romelle says: "Generations ago, in an effort to increase our odds of survival, Lotor announced that he was creating another colony far from our own."
Romelle says: "But in order to do so, he needed to assess which Alteans were viable candidates to survive the journey."
Romelle says: "One by one, every Altean in the colony was given a series of tests."
Romelle says: "Those who were deemed fit for the journey were loaded onto a cargo ship and taken to the second colony."
Romelle says: "It was considered the highest honor."
Romelle says: "Any communication between the colonies was strictly prohibited, for fear that it would compromise the other's location."
Cut to a dolly down from the top of Lotor's statue to Romelle looking at its base, on which names are inscribed in Altean as a kind of memorial.
Romelle says: "This is the world I was born into, one of unquestioning devotion to a supposed messiah."
Romelle says: "My brother Bandor was always faithful, but I had questions."
Romelle walks toward the base of the statue and places her hand on the names.
Romelle says: "So many of our people gone to the new colony."
Romelle says: "Petrulius, Gnautu, Rahz, and of course, Mother and Father."
Romelle says: "I miss them all so much."
Bandor says: "I'm sure we'll have a chance to see them again when we're chosen to travel to the new colony."
Romelle says: "But why can't we talk to them now?"
Romelle says: "Lotor must have a way of communicating with them."
Romelle says: "He travels there all the time."
Romelle says: "So why does he keep us in the dark?"
Bandor says: "You know why."
Bandor says: "Communication with the other colony would risk discovery by the Galra."
Romelle says: "So we're told."
Cut to another screening of Alteans, where Romelle is deemed unfit.
Romelle says: "Eventually Bandor grew old enough to be assessed for the journey to the other colony, and he was selected to leave immediately."
Bandor walks eagerly to the cargo ship; Romelle runs after him.
Romelle says: "Don't do this!"
Bandor says: "It is Lotor's will."
Romelle says: "I'll never see you again!"
Romelle says: "Don't let him tear our family apart!"
Bandor says: "Don't worry, I'm sure you'll be selected to come to the colony soon."
Bandor says: "In the meantime, I made you something."
Bandor says: "It's a communicator."
Romelle clutches it to her chest, making sure the soldiers aren't looking, then turns back to Bandor.
Romelle says: "Will I be able to talk to you on the other colony?"
Bandor says: "I haven't had a chance to test it yet, but..."
Bandor says: "I hope so."
Bandor says: "Just remember, we suffer this isolation so the next generation may not have to."
Bandor says: "Goodbye, Romelle."
The camera focuses on their hands as Bandor slowly lets go and walks onto the ship, leaving a grieving Romelle behind. Cut to her watching the ship leave, then sitting on a hill overlooking the colony with the communicator in her hands.

Bandor says: "You were right!"
Romelle says: "Where are you?"
Bandor says: "The forest..."
Bandor says: "outside town."
Bandor says: "Hurry!"
Romelle runs toward a column of smoke in the forest, with a particle barrier sparking and fraying above it showing a strange blue glow beyond the sky. Cut to Romelle standing on the edge of a hollow, where an Altean pod has crashed and caught fire. Romelle gasps and runs toward the pilot, Bandor, who is hunched over the console. She lifts up his shoulders and is horrified to see his face, now emaciated and scarred.
Romelle says: "Bandor..."
Bandor says: "Lotor..."
Bandor says: "the other..."
Bandor says: "colony..."
Bandor says: "it's all a lie..."
Romelle says: "No!"
Lotor says: "Over here!"
Romelle looks up sharply at the distant voice and the sound of a gun being cocked. Cut to Lotor and two of his soldiers walking toward the crashed ship.
Lotor says: "Clean up the wreckage."
Lotor says: "Leave no evidence this ever happened."
His words echo off the trees as the camera pulls back to reveal Romelle hiding behind a large tree trunk before running off. Cut to Lotor frowning, then setting his face determinedly. Fade to the top of Lotor's statue against another blue sunny sky as leaves blow gently in the breeze. Romelle gazes coldly up at the statue.
Romelle says: "My brother was dead."
Romelle says: "I knew the truth, or at least part of it, but I also knew that no one would believe me without proof."
Romelle says: "When Keith and Krolia arrived, they were my last chance at finding it."
Romelle says: "I told them what had happened to my brother, and, as it turned out, so many Alteans that had been taken before him."
Romelle says: "As they explained their mission to me, we knew there must have been a connection between the missing Alteans and the pure strain of quintessence."
Cut to an exterior shot of Romelle's house that night.
Keith says: "Given your brother's weakened state , he couldn't have piloted his ship for very long."
Keith says: "The other colony has to be somewhere nearby."
Krolia says: "There is a moon orbiting this planet that could house a colony."
Keith says: "Well, it's our only lead."
Keith says: "But how will we get there?"
Romelle says: "I have an idea."
Dissolve to the four walking down a catwalk to another building against the light of a full moon. Romelle opens the sliding doors.
Romelle says: "These transports haven't been used in generations."
Romelle says: "None of the Alteans in the colony would know how to fly one, even if we desired to."
The hangar inside reveals an Altean ship, exactly like the ones in the Castle of Lions.
Keith says: "I think I got us covered there."

Cut to a shot of sliding doors, which are forced open by Keith's blade, as the three force their way into a room full of large metal tubes. Keith, Krolia, and Romelle walk across the room, passing a jar in shadow that seems to house a body with tubes connected to it. Romelle walks over to one and rubs her hand over the glass to clear the fog, and is horrified to see the dessicated, dead-eyed face of an Altean.
Romelle says: "No!"
Romelle says: "Petrulius!"
Romelle says: "What's happening to them?"
Romelle says: "These people were supposed to be headed to the colony!"
Keith says: "Lotor is harvesting their quintessence!"
Cut back to the present, as Shiro, Coran, Pidge, Lance, Hunk, Krolia, and Keith are gathered in a circle around Romelle.
Coran says: "That's..."
Coran says: "horrifying!"
Pidge says: "All this time..."
Lance says: "I can't believe he fooled us."
Keith says: "He's a monster."
Keith says: "Huh?"
Keith looks up as the Castle's sensors alert them to the ship's return.
Coran says: "They're back!"
Romelle says: "What are you waiting for?"
Romelle says: "Open fire!"
Lance says: "No!"
Lance says: "Princess Allura is with him!"
Hunk says: "We're gonna let him back on board?!"
Hunk says: "!"
Coran says: "We must!"
Coran says: "As long as the princess is with him, we cannot risk any sort of attack!"
Shiro says: "Coran and Lance are right."
Shiro says: "We can't do anything until the princess is safe."
Shiro says: "Once Allura is secure, we will take Lotor down!"
Cut to Lotor helping Allura by the hand out of the ship. They remain pressed against each other.
Lotor says: "We accomplished something amazing today, and it would have never happened had it not been for you."
Allura says: "It is a moment that I truly will never forget."
Lotor leans in, closing his eyes. They meet in the middle with a kiss. Cut to the doors to the bridge opening as Allura and Lotor walk in, and the camera immediately zooms in on a furious Coran, and everyone else surrounding him.
Allura says: "What's going on?"
Krolia and Keith silently move in to surround Lotor, Krolia with her pistol and Keith with his blade. Lance pulls out his bayard, ready to fire.
Lance says: "Allura, step away from Lotor."
Allura says: "I will do no such thing."
Allura says: "Tell me what's happening here!"
Romelle says: "Lotor is a monster , and has been harvesting Altean quintessence for generations!"
Allura says: "An Altean!"
Cut to a close-up of Romelle.

Lotor says: "You know nothing about what you speak!"
Allura says: "What are they talking about?"
Lotor says: "Allura, listen to me."
Lotor says: "Allura, do not let this ruin everything we've worked for!"
Lotor says: "Think of what we experienced in the quintessence field."
Lotor grabs her hand, but Allura has heard enough. She grabs his hand, picks him up, and hurls him toward the ground so hard he bounces twice off the floor and is knocked unconscious. Close-up of Allura, whose eyes are full of heartbreak and rage. Suddenly, an alarm sounds. Cut to the main screen of the bridge, showing the hangar and shots of Acxa and Ezor breaking in.
Coran says: "The hangar's been breached!"
Hunk says: "It's Lotor's troops."
Hunk says: "They're stealing the ships!"
Suddenly, Shiro falls to the ground, crying out in pain, flashes of Haggar's face flickering in front of him. He clutches his head, eyes wide with fear.
Keith says: "Shiro?"
Close-up of Shiro's face flickering back and forth from Haggar's, which is at the same angle. Her voice echoes in his mind as he grunts with the effort of trying to push her out.
Haggar says: "Give in."
Haggar says: "You cannot resist."
Shiro cries out, gritting his teeth, as the sounds of the room he's in become faint and muffled, replaced by ominous whispers.
Coran says: "What's happening to him?!"
Coran says: "!"
Cut to Shiro's POV, outlined in purple, looking up at the concerned and frightened Lance and Pidge. Rapid zoom to Haggar, standing in her chamber, arms raised.

Lance says: "What are youâ€”"
Shiro punches him, throwing him backward.
Allura says: "Lance!"
Shiro's hand glows vibrant purple as he summons the black bayard, which takes the form of Zarkon's, an angular and menacing sword. He throws it at Allura, who dodges and moves protectively toward Romelle. The last shot is of Shiro's fist colliding with the camera. Cut to the outside of the bridge doors, which open to reveal that Shiro has knocked Allura and Romelle unconscious and slung Lotor over his shoulders. Allura comes to only in enough time to watch Shiro walk down the hallway.
Cut to Keith, Pidge, Krolia, and space pupper outside the podbay doors, which slide open just as a Sincline ship shoots out into space. The three look up as the second begins takeoff with Ezor in the cockpit. Close-up on her face as she grins, then quick fade out to the outside of the ship where she fires. Everyone runs for cover, Pidge hiding behind the doors. Ezor turns the ship around and flies out of the podbay.
Cut to Pidge in her hiding place as Shiro runs past her. Allura's voice is heard over the intercoms.
Allura says: "Shiro's gone mad!"
Allura says: "He's escaping with Lotor!"
Allura says: "Stop him before he leaves the ship!"
Pidge runs after them. Shiro puts the still-unconscious Lotor in the passenger seat of a pod and jumps in to take the helm. Pidge summons her bayard, preparing to fire, before Shiro meets her eyes. She falters, and the pod's shields activate. Cut to the outside of the Castle of Lions as the pod flies away. Cut to Shiro in the pilot seat, then fade to Haggar's face.
Haggar says: "Good."

Hunk says: "Yeah, I'll manage."
Lance says: "We've got this."
Cut to the podbay.
Keith says: "Then let's go!"
Keith says: "If we're gonna fight Lotor's ships, we'll need Voltron!"
Pidge says: "Shiro's gone; who's gonna pilot the Black Lion?"
Keith says: "I will."
Cut to the Black Lion's hangar as Keith runs toward it, back in his red armor. Close-up of the Black Lion's eyes, which glow gold before the camera zooms out and the Lion roars, its paladin returned.
Cut to a profile shot of the Sincline ships and the Altean pod flying through space before a shot strikes Acxa's ship. She turns, furious, to see the Voltron Lions in pursuit, Keith flying the Black Lion forward to chase after Shiro. Cut to the cockpit of the Altean pod.
Keith says: "Shiro, it's Keith!"
Keith says: "Shiro, it's gonna be okay."
Keith says: "We just haveâ€”"
Shiro coldly raises his finger and taps the screen, cutting off communications. Cut to the Black Lion's cockpit, where Keith sits aghast before his transmissions notify him of the other paladins.
Hunk says: "I can't take them!"
Pidge says: "KEITH!"
Keith turns the Black Lion around, away from the Altean pod and back toward the fight. Cut to a shot of a Sincline ship as a Lion's lasers fire, missing it, before it fires its lasers up at the Red Lion. The Yellow and Blue Lions weave around the shot before Hunk is hit; Red turns to check on him but quickly launches upward to avoid another shot. Lance prepares to fire the mouth cannon, but another Sincline ship strikes him from behind and knocks him sideways. Blue flies through as a Sincline ship fires lasers, and Green attempts to fire before being struck by a Sincline shot. Pidge looks up from the cockpit to see a Sincline ship's laser headed straight for her before it's cut off by a laser shot. Green turns and Black flies in front of her, coming in the center of the Lions' formation.
Keith says: "Guys, we're no match for them in our Lions!"
Keith says: "FORM VOLTRON!"
Form Voltron sequence.
Voltron turns to face the Sincline ships. The screen splits between the five paladins on the left and Zethrid, Ezor, and Acxa on the right. Cut to Shiro, face set as he flies the Altean ship toward Haggar.
