PIDGE says: ""Oh, no!"
HUNK says: ""Please tell me there's not a giant monster in there."
HUNK says: "Please tell me it's empty!"
HUNK says: "Or full of space candy."
HUNK says: "One of those two."
HUNK says: "Either one is fine."
LANCE says: ""I don't think it's a piñata, Hunk."
KEITH says: ""If it's the same kind of monster that attacked us on Arus, we already know how to beat it."
KEITH uses the Red Bayard to summon a saber for Voltron; PIDGE readies Voltron's shield.
SHIRO says: ""Hold your ground!"
The massive Drazil emerges from its transport ship and attacks Voltron with its chest cannon. The Paladins defend themselves with their shield, but are pushed back.
HUNK says: ""It's not candy!"
LANCE says: ""And it's not the same monster!"
Frantically, Voltron dodges the chest cannon blasts.
SHIRO says: ""We need to draw its fire away from the Balmera's surface!"
The Paladins try fighting Drazil while flying around to avoid getting the Balmera hit. They defend with their shield, but the Robeast's chest cannon is too strong.
LANCE says: ""We can't hold out!"
PIDGE says: ""My Lion's weakening!"
PIDGE says: "If the shield sustains structural damage, we're done for!"
KEITH says: ""Pidge is right!"
LANCE says: ""Oh Pidge is right."
LANCE says: "I'm the one that said, "We can't hold out!"
KEITH says: ""Lance, watch your footing!"
The Blue Lion trips, and Voltron falls over, losing its shield.
Evasive Maneuvers.
The Paladins groan from the fall.
SHIRO says: ""Okay, Team Voltron, disband!"
The Lions split apart.
SHIRO says: ""Everyone, evasive maneuvers!"
SHIRO says: "It can't shoot us all at once!"
Unfortunately, Drazil spreads its arms, which are covered in laser cannons, and fires all of them to assault the Paladins with laser fire.
SHIRO says: ""Okay, it can do that too."
The Paladins scramble to avoid being hit; the Castle of Lions suddenly appears to blast Drazil with a laser. Drazil responds by firing a massive blast back.
Allura says: ""Where does Zarkon get these beasts from?"
Allura says: "And how do they keep finding us?"
CORAN says: ""Princess, the particle barrier won't sustain much longer."
CORAN says: "It's still not at full strength after the blast from the Galra ship."
SHIRO says: ""Keith, try to draw its fire!"
SHIRO says: "I'm coming in from above!"
KEITH says: ""Roger!"
KEITH uses the Red Lion's heat ray to draw the Robeast's attention while SHIRO sneaks in from behind with the Black Lion, prepared to fire its mouth cannon. Drazil is able to rotate an eye cannon around and blast the Black Lion. SHIRO pulls away at the last second to avoid being hit.
LANCE says: ""We need to find its blind spot!"
PIDGE says: ""I don't think this thing has a blind spot."
PIDGE says: "It has a thousand eyes."
HUNK is frantically dodging the lasers in the Yellow Lion.
HUNK says: ""Laser eyes."
HUNK says: "Laser eyes!"
PIDGE says: ""What do we do?"
PIDGE says: "Fighting this thing is like fighting an entire fleet at once!"
KEITH says: ""I think we've got to aim for those laser eyes and take them out."
Allura says: ""We'll cover you from up here!"
The Castle of Lions fires lasers at Drazil; the Robeast retaliates with an onslaught of laser fire against the Castleship's particle barrier.
CORAN says: ""We've lost the spectral generator!"
CORAN says: "Going to reserve!"
CORAN says: "There's a fire in VIN bay three!"
CORAN says: "Suppressors on!"
CORAN says: "Suppressors out!"
CORAN says: "Princess, the ship is being torn apart!"
Allura says: ""We're taking heavy fire up here!"
Allura says: "We're in trouble!"
SHIRO says: ""Princess, pull back!"
SHIRO says: "Get out of its range, now!"
Allura says: ""We will not abandon you!"
SHIRO says: ""You're not abandoning us."
SHIRO says: "We're about to pull back anyway."
HUNK says: ""We are?"
SHIRO says: ""We can't hold out."
SHIRO says: "We have to."
SHIRO says: "Lions, to the mine shafts!"
SHIRO says: "It's the only place the monster can't get us."
PIDGE says: ""Roger that!"
Allura says: ""Heading into orbit!"
The Paladins fly the Lions into the mine shafts while Castle of Lions flies into space.
Collapse.
SHIRO, KEITH, and HUNK meet SHAY's family at the bottom of a mine shaft. LANCE and PIDGE are in a different mine shaft.
RAX says: ""What is happening?"
KEITH says: ""There's a monster up there that Zarkon sent to destroy us."
SHAY says: ""A monster?"
SHAY says: "Will Zarkon's savagery never abate?"
SHAY says: "Perhaps our people were never meant to be free."
HUNK says: ""Shay, don't give up."
HUNK says: "Zarkon's power grows with every planet he conquers, but he's weakened by every being that fights back."
SHAY says: ""Fight back?"
SHAY says: "Against a monster like that?"
SHAY says: "How?"
HUNK says: ""I don't know, but we can beat it."
HUNK says: "Tell her, Keith."
KEITH says: ""Can we?"
SHIRO says: ""Yes, we can!"
SHIRO says: "This is our first mission and we're not going to fail."
SHIRO says: "We can beat it."
SHIRO says: "We just need some time to come up with a plan."
HUNK says: ""See?"
HUNK says: "Told you we can."
HUNK says: "Thanks, Shiro."
The Balmera groans and the planet rumbles.
HUNK says: ""Do you guys feel that over there?"
LANCE and PIDGE are in a rumbling mine shaft.
LANCE says: ""Yeah, we feel it."
PIDGE says: ""It's that sound again."
PIDGE says: "What is that?"
SHAY's grandmother places her hand on the ground cracking apart. The Balmera stills.
RAX says: ""That great noise comes from the Balmera itself."
RAX says: "Our home crumbles beneath our feet."
RAX says: "The Balmera is dying."
SHIRO speaks to ALLURA and CORAN over the communication channel.
SHIRO says: ""Coran, Allura, are you there?"
Allura says: ""Shiro, we're here."
SHIRO says: ""The Balmera—"
CORAN says: ""We already know."
CORAN says: "Our scanners are showing the life energy draining from the Balmera."
CORAN brings up a scan of the Balmera on screen of the Castle of Lions. In the mine shaft, PIDGE activates her armor to view the scan.
PIDGE says: ""How does that happen?"
CORAN speaks to the Paladins through the communication channel as PIDGE and SHIRO show the other Paladins the scan of the Balmera.
CORAN says: ""Removing crystals from a Balmera is like removing a vital part of the mighty beast."
CORAN says: "The Balmera needs time to regenerate itself to stay healthy, but the Galra's greed may have cost this noble Balmera its life."
HUNK says: ""So, what's gonna happen?"
CORAN says: ""Its core will collapse, destabilizing the entire skeletal structure."
CORAN says: "Anything or anyone remaining on the Balmera at that point will be crushed into dust."
SHIRO says: ""How long before its core collapses?"
CORAN says: ""Probably a matter of hours."
CORAN says: "The mighty organism willingly gives itself to all, but not all return its kindness."
On the Castle of Lions, ALLURA stands at the Bridge.
Allura says: ""Then our time is short."
Allura says: "We'll evacuate the planet."
Allura says: "We need to get all the Balmerans to the Castle of Lions before the planet implodes."
SHIRO and HUNK appear on the Castleship's screen.
HUNK says: ""Okay, that sounds like a good plan, but how on Earth do you plan on landing the Castle with that monster-thingy on the surface?"
PIDGE appears on the Castleship's screen.
PIDGE says: ""You'll need a distraction."
SHIRO says: ""We'll engage the beast in our Lions."
SHIRO says: "With it distracted, Allura and Coran will land the Castle and load all of its citizens."
LANCE says: ""Or we could load Balmerans into our Lions a few at a time and shuttle them to the ship."
LANCE says: "No engaging ferocious laser-eye guy."
LANCE says: "How long would that take?"
CORAN says: ""Days?"
CORAN says: "Weeks?"
KEITH says: ""We only have hours."
In the mine shaft.
SHIRO says: ""Look, we don't need to beat this thing."
SHIRO says: "We just need to bait it away from the ship."
SHIRO says: "Provoke and evade."
HUNK says: ""Okay, here's the thing."
HUNK says: "I'm worried that we're going to be really, really good at the provoking part, and then like really bad at the evading part."
HUNK says: "But if—"
HUNK says: "if this is what it takes to save Shay and everyone on the planet, then I'm in."
KEITH turns to SHAY.
KEITH says: ""Can you contact the other Balmerans?"
SHAY says: ""I can, but I know not what they'll say."
SHAY says: "Leave the planet?"
SHAY says: "Our home?"
In the Castle of Lions.
Allura says: ""It's the only option."
Allura says: "I'm coming down."
CORAN says: ""Princess, no!"
CORAN says: "It's too dangerous!"
Allura says: ""Someone has to be there to lead these people out."
PIDGE speaks to ALLURA through their video transmission.
PIDGE says: ""You're coming down?"
PIDGE says: "That thing will spot your pod and blow it to pieces."
Allura says: ""Let me worry about that."
Allura says: "You just focus on keeping the creature distracted."
Plan B.
The Princess Descends.
The Paladins launch their Lions from the mine shafts and attack Drazil, who gives chase.
HUNK says: ""Okay, we've provoked."
HUNK says: "Time to evade!"
ALLURA is preparing to launch from the Castle of Lions on a drop-sled. SHIRO speaks over their communication channel.
SHIRO says: ""Princess, we've lured the monster away."
SHIRO says: "It's time."
Allura says: ""I'll contact you all when I'm on the ground."
CORAN speaks over the Castle intercom.
CORAN says: ""Be careful out there."
ALLURA launches from the Castleship; LANCE sees her descent.
LANCE says: ""s that Allura?"
The Robeast Drazil tries to attack ALLURA with laser fire.
HUNK says: ""We gotta protect the Princess!"
HUNK shields ALLURA with the Yellow Lion and is badly hit. The other Paladins distract Drazil so ALLURA reaches the mine shafts safely. SHIRO speaks to her over the communication channel.
Allura says: ""I'm on the ground."
SHIRO says: ""Hurry!"
SHIRO says: "I don't know how long we can hold this thing off."
ALLURA runs over to SHAY and her family.
Allura says: ""Shay, I'm going to need your help."
SHAY says: ""Princess?"
ALLURA places her hand on the tunnel wall.
Allura says: ""Have you contacted the other Balmerans?"
SHAY and her family look dejected.
Allura says: ""What is it?"
Allura says: "What's going on?"
SHAY says: ""All Balmerans give thanks for the kindness you and the Paladins bestowed upon us, but, alas, we cannot take leave of our home."
Allura says: ""What?"
SHAY says: ""If our great Balmera's life cycle is over because of us, then our desire is to stay with it until the end."
Allura says: ""But you'll never survive."
RAX says: ""We contacted the others, and all agree."
RAX says: "It's not right that you risk your lives for us."
RAX says: "Please, away."
RAX says: "We ask for no more guilt and shame upon us."
SHAY says: ""It is our wish."
SHAY says: "The wish of all Balmerans."
Allura says: ""No."
Allura says: "I won't give up on you."
Allura says: "I won't give up on any of you, no matter the circumstances."
SHAY says: ""But we do not ask this of you."
SHAY says: "Please!"
Allura says: ""I have heard your words."
Allura says: "Now let me speak mine."
Allura says: "I want to talk to the Balmerans."
Allura says: "Can you get a message to them from me?"
SHAY'S GRANDMOTHER says: ""There is no need to speak for you."
SHAY'S GRANDMOTHER says: "You have a unique power within."
SHAY'S GRANDMOTHER says: "The Balmera will carry your words."
SHAY'S GRANDMOTHER points to ALLURA's hand on the wall, which is glowing. ALLURA recoils at the sight.
SHAY'S GRANDMOTHER says: ""Speak your heart, child."
SHAY'S GRANDMOTHER says: "All can hear you."
SHAY'S GRANDMOTHER takes ALLURA's hand and places it back on the wall. ALLURA focuses and speaks aloud, but her words are transmitted to all Balmerans.
Allura says: ""Balmerans, this is Princess Allura."
Allura says: "You don't know me, but I am here to help."
Allura says: "I know what it's like to watch your home planet die."
Allura says: "For I come from planet Altea, a planet that has long been destroyed by the Galra."
Allura says: "But I refuse to give up."
Allura says: "And now, you all have the same choice."
Allura says: "You can decide now to devote your lives to making sure this never happens to another planet."
Allura says: "I am eternally sorry for what has happened to the Balmera, but I beg you, do not let its dying be in vain."
Allura says: "Honor the Balmera's death by refusing to give up."
Allura says: "Join me in my fight against the Galra."
SHAY'S GRANDMOTHER places her own hand on the wall to hear the response.
SHAY'S GRANDMOTHER says: ""Your words have touched our hearts."
Allura says: ""Thank you."
SHAY'S GRANDMOTHER says: ""No, thank you."
SHAY'S GRANDMOTHER says: "You've given us reason to hope again."
Allura says: ""Everyone, head to the caves just under the surface."
Sacred Ceremony.
CORAN is looking at the map of the Balmera on the Castle of Lions showing Balmerans moving.
CORAN says: ""Princess, your speech must have worked."
CORAN says: "The Balmerans are moving toward the surface!"
Allura says: ""Coran, we're just beneath the surface."
Allura says: "Triangulate my position."
Allura says: "This is your landing zone."
CORAN says: ""Yes, Allura."
CORAN says: "Readying ship."
CORAN says: "Castle of Lions, coming in!"
CORAN says: "Paladins, how are you holding up?"
KEITH is fighting Drazil.
KEITH says: ""I think we've got him pretty distracted."
KEITH says: "Are the Balmerans in position?"
Allura says: ""They're making their way to the top."
All the Balmerans slowly climb towards the surface. The Castle of Lions lands just outside a mine shaft. CORAN descends to the surface in a transport pod and motions for Balmerans to enter.
CORAN says: ""Bring them out!"
CORAN says: "Hurry, now!"
The Balmera suddenly rumbles violently, causing the mine shaft to start crumbling and rock slides to occur.
Allura says: ""No!"
Balmerans are in a panic but not injured.
CORAN says: ""It's on the verge of collapsing!"
CORAN says: "We have to go!"
Allura says: ""But the Balmerans!"
RAX says: ""They're trapped!"
RAX says: "What can be done?"
RAX says: "Time is short!"
The Paladins are dodging Drazil's lasers in their Lions; the lasers are hitting the Balmera.
HUNK says: ""Every hit weakens the Balmera."
HUNK says: "Have you evacuated yet?"
HUNK says: "What's happening?"
CORAN speaks over the communication channel.
CORAN says: ""The Balmerans are trapped."
CORAN says: "Just keep distracting that beast!"
HUNK says: ""Uh, do you want us to distract it by dying?"
HUNK says: "Because that's what's going to happen!"
SHIRO says: ""Guys, remember when I said we didn't have to beat it?"
HUNK says: ""Yes, I remember that."
SHIRO says: ""Well, we might have to beat it."
ALLURA looks over the mine shaft.
SHAY says: ""We're lost!"
SHAY says: "All are trapped with no chance for escape!"
Allura says: ""We can't give up."
SHAY says: ""But what can be done?"
SHAY notices the ground glowing underneath the Castle of Lions.
SHAY says: ""The Balmera..."
SHAY says: "The ground beneath your mighty ship appears healed."
SHAY says: "Its essence thrives."
SHAY says: "But how?"
Allura says: ""The Castle!"
SHAY'S GRANDMOTHER says: ""Not just the Castle, but you as well."
CORAN says: ""It's true."
CORAN says: "Your Altean energy combined with the ship's Crystal has revitalized this part of the Balmera."
Allura says: ""That's it!"
Allura says: "Maybe we can perform the ceremony you spoke about."
Allura says: "We can save the Balmera."
RAX says: ""What ceremony?"
CORAN says: ""In the days of old, when Alteans were given the gift of Crystals from a Balmera, we would repay its sacrifice by performing a ceremony."
CORAN says: "A sacred Altean would re-infuse the Balmera with Quintessence."
CORAN says: "In this way, we had a symbiotic relationship."
Allura says: ""The Galra have only been taking."
Allura says: "It's time we give back."
Allura says: ""I can connect with the Crystal in the Bridge and use the Castle's power as an amplifier."
CORAN says: ""When your father performed the ceremony, it was on a much smaller scale."
CORAN says: "I beg you."
CORAN says: "To heal an entire planet, it could take more energy than you possess."
CORAN says: "You may not..."
CORAN says: "live through it."
Allura says: ""I know you're scared for me, Coran, but I must try."
ALLURA begins the ceremony with SHAY's family and the other Balmerans.
Rip Vol Winkle.
The Paladins are scrambling to avoid Drazil's laser fire.
KEITH says: ""Guys, this isn't working."
KEITH says: "We'll never take this beast down in our Lions."
PIDGE says: ""Well, forming Voltron didn't work, either."
LANCE says: ""Not without some way to shoot all those laser eyes at once."
The Yellow Lion displays the keyhole console for HUNK's Bayard.
HUNK says: ""That's weird."
HUNK says: "What are you trying to tell me?"
HUNK summons his Bayard.
HUNK says: ""Guys!"
HUNK says: "Guys, something's happening here!"
HUNK says: "I-I think there is a way to take down all those laser eyes at once."
PIDGE says: ""Well, what is it?"
HUNK says: ""Do you remember how Voltron formed that sword with Keith's Bayard?"
HUNK says: "I think my Lion's telling me I can do the same thing with my Bayard."
KEITH says: ""Are you sure?"
HUNK says: ""Let's find out."
HUNK says: "Form thingy!"
HUNK inserts his Bayard into the keyhole console; nothing happens.
HUNK says: ""It didn't work!"
SHIRO says: ""Because we didn't form Voltron yet."
HUNK says: ""Oh, right."
HUNK says: "Yeah, I know."
PIDGE says: ""Guys, whatever we're planning, let's hurry up and do it."
The Robeast notices the Castle of Lions and moves in to attack.
SHIRO says: ""We've got to defend the Castle!"
SHIRO says: "Everyone, follow me."
SHIRO says: "Form Voltron!"
After forming Voltron, the HUNK's Bayard summons a shoulder cannon to counterattack Drazil's energy blast.
SHIRO says: ""It's not enough!"
HUNK says: ""We'll have to try something else!"
HUNK is able to deflect the blast away from the Castle of Lions. Voltron takes flight, drawing Drazil's attacks away from the Castleship. HUNK's computer shows Voltron has locked on to all of the Robeast's laser eyes.
HUNK says: ""Are you guys seeing this?"
KEITH says: ""Roger that."
SHIRO says: ""Let's see what this thing can do."
SHIRO says: "Engage!"
The shoulder cannon fires a shower of energy bullets at once, hitting all of Drazil's eyes and rendering it still. Meanwhile, ALLURA performs the rejuvenation ceremony and Quintessence spreads across the Balmera.
SHIRO says: ""Guys, look!"
The Quintessence is absorbed. Drazil suddenly begins attacking Voltron again. KEITH punches Drazil using the Red Lion. The Robeast falls to the ground in a heap, lying still. ALLURA is released from the energy of the Castleship. SHAY gathers ALLURA in her arms.
SHAY says: ""Princess, are you all right?"
ALLURA appears unconscious, but wakes up.
Allura says: ""Did it work?"
RAX has his hand on the ground.
RAX says: ""Yes."
RAX says: "The Balmera lives."
RAX says: "It thanks you."
The Paladins leave their Lions and arrive to check on ALLURA. Drazil suddenly reawakens a second time, preparing to attack them.
Allura says: ""No!"
The Balmera suddenly courses its Crystals though the Monster, destroying it and encasing its body.
HUNK says: ""No."
HUNK says: "Way."
CORAN says: ""The Balmera just saved us."
Allura says: ""Look at the Crystals!"
Crystals begin forming across the Balmera. HUNK begins petting the planet's surface.
HUNK says: ""Oh, who's a good Balmera?"
HUNK says: "You are."
HUNK says: "Who ate the big monster?"
HUNK says: "You did."
HUNK says: "Yes, you did."
HUNK says: "Yes, you did."
SHIRO, KEITH, and LANCE look unamused.
KEITH says: ""Dude, what are you doing?"
HUNK says: ""What?"
HUNK says: "It's alive, and it wuvs my scwatches."
KEITH facepalms.
To See the Sky.
After the battle, HUNK sits with SHAY atop the Yellow Lion at night.
SHAY says: ""Thank you for honoring your vow to return."
HUNK says: ""I should be thanking you."
HUNK says: "You made me understand what's most important."
HUNK says: "Zarkon and his Galra Empire are destroying lives."
HUNK says: "I'm a part of a team that can change that."
HUNK says: "I know that, now."
HUNK and SHAY smile at each other. SHAY notices a sun rising on the horizon. She has not seen such a thing before.
SHAY says: ""What is that?"
HUNK is smiling.
HUNK says: ""It's the dawn of a new day."
Episode ends with HUNK and SHAY watching the sunrise.
