HUNK says: ""I can't tell if he looks healthy..."
HUNK says: "or not."
PIDGE says: ""I think he's breathing weird."
KEITH says: ""Oh, come on!"
KEITH tries tapping on the pod; ALLURA stops him.
ALLURA says: ""Not yet!"
ALLURA says: "A few more ticks."
KEITH says: ""How much better do you think he's gonna get in a few more ticks?"
PIDGE says: ""And what exactly is a tick?"
ALLURA says: ""You know, a time-slice."
SHIRO says: ""What, like a second?"
ALLURA says: ""What is a..."
ALLURA says: ""second"?"
PIDGE takes out a clock counting seconds to show ALLURA.
PIDGE says: ""Like this."
ALLURA says: ""I'm not sure."
ALLURA says: "I think ticks are bigger."
ALLURA says: "Coran, do you have a ticker?"
CORAN says: ""Right here, Princess."
CORAN takes out a ticker counting ticks to compare.
HUNK says: ""I think ticks are a little slower."
PIDGE says: ""I can't tell."
PIDGE says: "We have to start them at the same time."
CORAN says: ""Okay."
CORAN says: "Ready, go!"
Both counters start together; everyone huddles around to watch.
HUNK says: ""Yes!"
HUNK says: "I think we're winning."
KEITH says: ""Winning what?"
KEITH says: "The intergalactic time-measuring competition?"
HUNK says: ""Yes."
Unbeknownst to the team, LANCE exits the Sleep Pod and stumbles over.
LANCE says: ""You guys having a clock party?"
HUNK says: ""Aw, Lance, you just ruined it."
HUNK says: "Uh—"
HUNK says: "Hey, Lance!"
HUNK hugs LANCE.
LANCE says: ""What happened?"
ALLURA says: ""We can tell you all about it while you get something to eat."
ALLURA says: "Are you able to walk?"
LANCE says: ""Talking?"
LANCE says: "Eating?"
LANCE says: "Are you asking me out on a date?"
ALLURA is unimpressed, as is most of the team.
PIDGE says: ""Yep."
PIDGE says: "There he is."
SHIRO says: ""Yep, he's okay."
KEITH says: ""Classic."
The team moves to the Dining Hall while LANCE eats food goo with the Altean Mice.
ALLURA says: ""He'd be Sendak's prisoner right now, if not for Pidge."
PIDGE says: ""Well, you wouldn't have survived the explosion if Hunk and Coran hadn't gotten a new Crystal."
LANCE says: ""Wow."
LANCE says: "Thanks, everybody."
LANCE says: "Sounds like the mice did more than you, though."
KEITH says: ""I punched Sendak!"
LANCE says: ""Yeah, apparently after I emerged from a coma and shot his arm off."
KEITH says: ""We had a bonding moment."
KEITH says: "I cradled you in my arms!"
LANCE says: ""Nope."
LANCE says: "Don't remember, didn't happen."
LANCE says: "So, what happened to Sendak?"
ALLURA says: ""He's frozen in a cryo-pod."
ALLURA says: "We're keeping him here in the Castle."
LANCE says: ""Are you sure that's a good idea?"
ALLURA says: ""He's too dangerous to be set free."
ALLURA says: "Besides, we might be able to get some information about Zarkon from him."
LANCE says: ""So, what's the plan now?"
HUNK says: ""We have to get back to the Balmera and save Shay and her people."
LANCE says: ""Wow!"
LANCE says: "You are really hung up on this lady."
HUNK says: ""No, it's not like that."
HUNK says: "Look, guys, when you see how Zarkon has treated these people and destroyed their home—"
HUNK says: "They've been under his thumb for so long, they don't even know what it is to be free."
HUNK says: "It's up to us to set this right."
HUNK says: "This is what being a Paladin of Voltron is all about."
HUNK says: "It's time to man up."
PIDGE frowns.
SHIRO says: ""Then let's get moving."
SHIRO says: "Time to go defend the universe."
The team begins to leave the Dining Hall. PIDGE stops them.
PIDGE says: ""Wait, I have something to say first."
PIDGE says: "I need to come clean and..."
PIDGE says: "I'm afraid this may change the way you all think about me."
PIDGE says: "Just so there are no secrets between us anymore, I can't "man up"."
PIDGE says: "..."
PIDGE says: "I'm a girl."
LANCE looks flabbergasted.
PIDGE says: ""I-I mean, I can "man up" because that's just a figure of speech."
PIDGE says: "I don't have to actually be a man to "man up."
PIDGE says: "" I just have to be tough."
PIDGE says: "But what I'm saying—"
LANCE says: ""Huh—"
LANCE says: "Eh—"
LANCE says: "Wha—"
LANCE says: "?!"
LANCE says: "!"
LANCE says: "You're a girl!"
LANCE says: "?"
LANCE says: "HOW!"
LANCE says: "?"
ALLURA says: ""I've known for some time, but I'm glad you've shared it with everyone."
HUNK says: ""Yeah, I figured."
KEITH says: ""Oh, yeah, me too."
CORAN says: ""Wait, w-we were supposed to think you were a boy?"
SHIRO says: ""Pidge, owning who you are is going to make you a better Paladin."
PIDGE sighs in relief.
PIDGE says: ""It's good to get that off my chest."
PIDGE says: "Now, let's launch this Castleship!"
The team leaves; LANCE remains behind and shakes his head in disbelief.
LANCE says: ""Wait, what?"
LANCE says: "Pidge is a girl and the Castle is a ship?"
LANCE says: "How long have I been out?"
ALLURA says: ""Activate interlock."
CORAN says: ""Dynotherms connected."
ALLURA says: ""Mega-thrusters are go."
CORAN says: ""We are ready to depart Planet Arus on your mark, Princess."
ALLURA says: ""Firing main engines for launch."
The Castle of Lions launches from Arus as the Arusians watch.
A Divisive Empire.
At ZARKON's Central Command, PROROK kneels before ZARKON on his throne. HAGGAR is at ZARKON's side.
PROROK says: "Sire, if capturing Voltron is the Empire's number-one priority, then I suggest we begin moving the main fleet toward its last known location posthaste."
HAGGAR says: ""Lord, after many years, the Komar Experiment is finally ready."
HAGGAR says: "Soon, we could have more Quintessence at our fingertips than ever imagined."
HAGGAR says: "We must test it before moving the fleet."
PROROK stands.
PROROK says: ""We don't have time for any more of your magic."
PROROK says: "We must move our ships now."
HAGGAR says: ""Voltron is the most powerful weapon ever created."
HAGGAR says: "His puny ships will never be up to the task."
HAGGAR says: "We must be well prepared for our next encounter."
ZARKON slams his hands on his throne; PROROK immediately kneels again.
ZARKON says: ""I know better than anyone the power of Voltron."
ZARKON says: "Haggar has my trust."
ZARKON says: "We will perform her test."
Afterward, PROROK speaks to THACE in the halls.
PROROK says: ""The witch has his ear."
PROROK says: "Keep sending our offer out to any scum between Planet Arus and Balmera X-95-Vox."
PROROK says: "I'll capture Voltron on my own."
Detour.
Space Cops.
In the Castle of Lions, HUNK is pacing the Bridge.
HUNK says: ""Okay."
HUNK says: "So, when we get there, what do you think?"
HUNK says: "Do we just roll up and like, start blasting?"
HUNK says: "Or do we land and have some..."
HUNK says: "kind of public address system, like, 'Attention, Galras."
HUNK says: "This is Voltron."
HUNK says: "Turn yourselves in!"
HUNK pauses and looks around.
HUNK says: ""No."
HUNK says: "Blasting, right?"
KEITH says: ""Hunk, calm down."
KEITH says: "And yes, blasting."
SHIRO says: ""Eh, it's our first big rescue mission."
SHIRO says: "He's excited."
HUNK gasps in defense.
HUNK says: ""She's not my girlfriend!"
HUNK says: "She's just a rock that I met and I admire very much."
Unusual alarms start blaring.
SHIRO says: ""What is it?"
SHIRO says: "Are we being attacked?"
ALLURA says: ""No, it seems to be a distress beacon."
ALLURA says: "It's coming from a nearby moon."
ALLURA says: "Apparently, a ship has lost power."
PIDGE says: ""I wonder who it is."
HUNK says: ""Whoever it is will have to wait."
HUNK says: "Shay has first priority."
HUNK says: "We can check back on them when we're done."
ALLURA says: ""The Paladin Code states that we must help all those in need."
LANCE says: ""Wow!"
LANCE says: "This is so cool."
LANCE says: "It's like we're space cops on space patrol."
LANCE says: "Coran, do we have a siren we can turn on?"
CORAN says: ""Uh, no, but we could record you making a siren noise and broadcast that to them."
LANCE says: ""Perfect!"
Lance tries to imitate a siren. SHIRO places a hand over LANCE's mouth.
SHIRO says: ""No, not doing that."
Stranded.
The Castle of Lions lands on the moon where ROLO and NYMA are waiting. ALLURA speaks over the intercom.
ALLURA says: ""Attention, damaged craft, this is Princess Allura."
ALLURA says: "We are coming to assist you."
ROLO is impressed by the sight.
ROLO says: ""Whoa."
ROLO says: "Nice ship."
In the Castleship Bridge, ALLURA prepares to exit with the Paladins.
ALLURA says: ""Stay aboard and try to get as many of our systems clear of that Galra crystal energy as you can."
ALLURA says: "We'll see who hailed us."
CORAN says: ""Yes, Princess."
ALLURA and the Paladins descend to greet the stranded crew on the moon's surface.
ROLO says: ""You don't know how glad we are to see some friendly faces."
ROLO says: "Most folks don't want to get tangled up with anyone who's on the run from the Galra."
KEITH says: ""So, you guys are fighting the Galra?"
ROLO says: ""Well, I don't think Zarkon is exactly quaking in his boots at the three of us, but we do what we can."
ROLO says: "I'm Rolo."
ROLO says: "This is Nyma, and our cyber-unit, Beezer."
NYMA says: ""Hi."
LANCE is struck by NYMA's beauty; PIDGE is amazed by BEEZER.
PIDGE says: ""Cool robot!"
LANCE takes NYMA'S HAND.
LANCE says: ""Hi!"
LANCE says: "Name's Lance."
SHIRO says: ""Was your ship damaged in a fight?"
ROLO says: ""Yeah, we've really been through it with the Galra."
ROLO says: "Parts are hard to come by."
ROLO says: "Luckily, we were able to limp to this moon about a week ago."
ROLO says: "If you didn't pick up our distress signal, I didn—"
ALLURA says: ""We're happy to help."
ALLURA says: "I am Princess Allura of Altea, and from now on, you won't be alone fighting the Galra."
ALLURA says: "You'll have the Paladins of Voltron by your side."
ROLO compares the serious SHIRO, KEITH, and HUNK with LANCE and PIDGE, who are goofing off with NYMA and BEEZER. He is not impressed.
ROLO says: ""..."
ROLO says: "Okay."
SHIRO says: ""I don't think they've heard of us."
KEITH says: ""It has been ten thousand years."
LANCE says: ""Voltron?"
LANCE says: "Five robot Lions that combine into this big robot..."
LANCE says: "guy?"
ROLO says: ""Sounds impressive."
ROLO says: "I'd love to see it."
ROLO says: "Or—"
ROLO says: "Or him."
ROLO says: "Them."
HUNK says: ""Why don't we just get to work on your ship?"
HUNK says: "I'm sure we all have places to be."
ROLO says: ""Sure."
ROLO opens his spacecraft.
ROLO says: ""Pretty much our whole flaxum assembly is shot."
ROLO says: "I don't know what kind of extra parts you carry in this rig of yours."
ROLO says: "I've never seen anything quite like it."
In the background, LANCE flirts with NYMA. SHIRO smacks him.
ALLURA says: ""I'm sure we can get you back up and running."
ALLURA says: "Give Hunk a list of what you need."
ALLURA says: "Coran can show you where to find it."
HUNK says: ""Okay."
ROLO says: ""We'll go with you."
ROLO says: "Don't want you to have to carry all that yourself."
ROLO says: "Come on, guys."
ROLO tries walking towards the Castle of Lions. HUNK stops him.
HUNK says: ""Uh, I don't think so."
HUNK says: "You can just wait out here."
ALLURA says: ""Hunk, don't be rude."
LANCE says: ""Yeah, mind your manners."
LANCE says: "There are ladies present."
LANCE winks at NYMA.
LANCE says: ""Hey."
SHIRO sighs.
HUNK says: ""Oh, I'm sorry."
HUNK says: "Oh, but does anyone remember the last time we let our defenses down?"
HUNK says: "Someone kind of set off a bomb."
HUNK says: "Remember, Lance?"
HUNK says: "You were almost killed."
LANCE says: ""Oh, yeah..."
SHIRO says: ""Hunk's right."
SHIRO says: "Sorry, but we have to be cautious."
ROLO says: ""Hey, I don't take it personal."
ROLO says: "That's how it is out here."
ROLO says: "You've got to look out for your own."
ROLO says: "You're doing a good job, big man."
ROLO hands HUNK a list of parts from BEEZER.
HUNK says: ""Yeah."
HUNK says: "Thanks."
Freedom Fighters.
ROLO sits with ALLURA, SHIRO, and KEITH. PIDGE is distracted by BEEZER. LANCE is with NYMA.
ROLO says: ""My planet was destroyed by the Galra and I was taken captive."
ROLO says: "I managed to escape, but not before I lost something."
ROLO displays his prosthetic left leg.
SHIRO says: ""I know exactly how that feels."
HUNK drags a hovercart full of parts over.
HUNK says: ""Well, I hope there are some parts in here that'll fit."
ROLO does not respond.
HUNK says: ""..."
HUNK says: "You know, to get your ship moving?"
ROLO says: ""Great!"
ROLO says: "Thanks."
ALLURA says: ""So, what can you tell us about Zarkon's forces?"
ALLURA says: "Where are they concentrated?"
ROLO says: ""Well, his Command Ship sits right in the center of the Empire."
ROLO says: "He mostly calls the shots from there and has his minions do the work, depending on who's closest."
ROLO says: "This is the territory of a real nasty bugger named Sendak."
KEITH says: ""Oh, we've met."
SHIRO says: ""How far are we from the center?"
ROLO says: ""We're way out on the fringes."
HUNK walks over.
HUNK says: ""Hey, sorry to interrupt, but I think you guys are kind of keeping Rolo from working."
HUNK says: "It's just that we're in a hurry."
HUNK says: "A hero named Shay saved my life, and I swore I would return to do the same for her and her people."
HUNK says: "You understand."
ROLO says: ""Sure."
ROLO says: "Sorry."
ROLO places a hand on HUNK's shoulder and then walks over to the hovercart to inspect the parts. SHIRO approaches HUNK to whisper quietly.
SHIRO says: ""Hunk, we're going to get going soon, but I think Rolo might have some information that could be helpful to us."
HUNK says: ""Not for nothin' but I don't trust this guy as far as I can throw him."
HUNK says: "I think we ought to leave him with the box parts and just say, 'Adiós, amigo—"
ROLO says: ""Hey, bud!"
ROLO says: "Sorry, but do you think you could hunt down a length of thermal pipe about yay long?"
ROLO gestures the length.
HUNK says: ""On the way."
HUNK groans and leaves. SHIRO, KEITH, and ALLURA approach ROLO.
SHIRO says: ""So, are there more freedom fighters?"
SHIRO says: "Any kind of organized resistance to the Galra?"
ROLO says: ""Only folks who haven't been colonized yet, or the lucky few, like us, who managed to escape somehow."
KEITH says: ""Well, we're going to change all that."
ROLO says: ""That's good to hear, but I've got to warn you, it's pretty bad out there."
ROLO says: "You don't know what you're up against."
The Heist.
Reckless Blue.
LANCE is talking to NYMA away from the rest of the team.
LANCE says: ""I mean, there are only five of us in the entire universe, so..."
LANCE says: "I guess you could say it's kind of a big deal."
NYMA says: ""I don't understand."
NYMA says: "The Lions are ships?"
NYMA says: "Are they, like, flying statues that you ride on?"
LANCE says: ""No, no, no."
LANCE says: "They're magic, but also super scientific and advanced."
LANCE says: "And they fly crazy fast and have all these incredible weapons."
LANCE says: "Really, the entire Castle is just insane!"
LANCE says: "I wish you could see it."
NYMA says: ""Yes, it's too bad we're not allowed inside."
NYMA says: "I would love a tour from one of the knights."
NYMA says: "But I guess the big one is in charge, huh?"
NYMA says: "You have to obey his orders?"
LANCE says: ""Who, Hunk?"
LANCE says: "Pfft, I don't have to listen to him!"
LANCE brings NYMA inside the Castle of Lions to the Bridge.
NYMA says: ""This place is incredible!"
LANCE says: ""Yeah, I guess."
LANCE says: "You get used to it."
NYMA says: ""But it's so gigantic."
NYMA says: "It must take you forever to get to your Lion."
LANCE says: ""Ooh, you'd be surprised."
LANCE brings NYMA with him down the zip-line to the Blue Lion's cockpit.
LANCE says: ""Pretty slick, right?"
NYMA says: ""Unbelievable!"
NYMA says: "Take me on a ride around the moon?"
LANCE says: ""Uh—"
LANCE says: "We should probably get back to the others."
NYMA says: ""Yeah, you're right."
NYMA says: "Maybe Keith will give me a ride."
LANCE says: ""No!"
LANCE says: "Whoah, whoah, hold on a second!"
LANCE says: "I mean what's the point of having the Lion if you can't enjoy it, right?"
LANCE says: "Giddy-up, buddy!"
LANCE activates the Blue Lion and takes off with NYMA. HUNK is working on ROLO's ship, but witnesses the Blue Lion leave.
HUNK says: ""Oh, Lance!"
ROLO says: ""Ah, let them have their fun."
ROLO says: "Thanks to you, this thing is just about ready, so we're going to be on our way soon."
ROLO says: "Too many light years on that guy, I guess."
HUNK suspiciously eyes the part he replaced.
HUNK says: ""Yeah."
The Komar Experiment.
ZARKON's Command Ship hovers above an unnamed planet. HAGGAR stands on a floating platform in the ship in the center of her four Druids.
HAGGAR says: ""Begin the ritual."
HAGGAR says: "Druids of the Four Directions, join us!"
HAGGAR's experiment saps the planet of all its Quintessence and stores it in the Command Ship. HAGGAR approaches ZARKON.
HAGGAR says: ""The Komar Experiment was a success."
HAGGAR says: "We have gained an entire planet's Quintessence, a feat that would have normally taken us years."
ZARKON says: ""Most impressive."
ZARKON says: "This will revolutionize the way we advance throughout the galaxy."
ZARKON says: "Mining and colonizing planets is a thing of the past."
ZARKON says: "With this much power available at our whim, we can now spend all of our time hunting down and capturing Voltron."
Theft.
LANCE is flying the Blue Lion around the moon.
NYMA says: "Look, a kinetic spring!"
NYMA says: "Let's land over there."
NYMA says: "The minerals reflect off the water, making a rainbow."
The Blue Lion flies over the spring, causing water to spray and a rainbow to appear.
LANCE says: ""Wow."
LANCE says: "Is there anything you don't know?"
With LANCE distracted, NYMA presses a button on her bracelet to signal ROLO. ROLO  suddenly exits the engine of his ship.
ROLO says: ""I think this thing is just about ready for a test flight."
ROLO says: "Beezer, come co-pilot for me."
ROLO says: "Be back in a tick."
ROLO and BEEZER enter their ship, leaving the Voltron team dumbfounded outside.
HUNK says: ""Uh..."
ROLO's spacecraft takes flight with no issues at all. Elsewhere, LANCE and NYMA stand at the kinetic spring by a tree.
LANCE says: ""So, ah, you want to see how fast I can climb this tree?"
NYMA giggles.
NYMA says: ""Aw, you are cute."
NYMA says: "Let me show you something."
NYMA says: "Give me your hand."
LANCE offers NYMA his hand and she handcuffs him to the tree.
LANCE says: ""Whoa!"
LANCE says: "Uh, this is..."
LANCE says: "kind of..."
ROLO's ship appears and abducts the Blue Lion.
LANCE says: ""Nyma, what's going on?"
NYMA says: ""Sorry, Lance."
NYMA says: "Maybe we'll meet again."
NYMA is raised into her ship and it takes off, leaving LANCE behind. LANCE looks around for his helmet to contact his team and sees it out of reach.
LANCE says: ""Oh, Quiznak..."
The rest of the team is waiting outside the Castle of Lions.
PIDGE says: ""How many ticks have they been gone?"
ALLURA says: ""I don't know."
ALLURA says: "I hope they didn't break down again."
HUNK says: ""Something ain't right."
LANCE reaches his helmet with his leg and uses its communicator.
LANCE says: ""Guys?"
LANCE says: "Hello?"
LANCE says: "Little help?"
SHIRO says: ""Lance?"
SHIRO says: "Lance!"
SHIRO says: "Are you all right?"
SHIRO says: "W-What's going on?"
LANCE says: ""Well, I'm kind of chained to a..."
LANCE says: "a tree."
HUNK says: ""I knew it!"
LANCE says: ""And I think Nyma and Rolo just stole the Blue Lion."
HUNK says: ""I knew it!"
SHIRO says: ""Where are they?"
LANCE says: ""Uh..."
LANCE says: "space?"
HUNK says: ""Uh, I never trusted those guys, right from the beginning!"
HUNK rants at length as the Paladins head to their Lions.
HUNK says: ""I mean, y'know, at first, it was just like a feeling in my gut, you know?"
HUNK says: "But when I was replacing that thermal pipe, the pipe was cracked, but none of the hardware around it was damaged."
KEITH says: ""Okay, we get it!"
HUNK says: ""I mean, if the thermal pipe is cracked, then, obviously, hello, the entire assembly should be totally roasted."
KEITH says: ""Okay!"
KEITH says: "We get it."
HUNK says: ""We should've had to replace the entire undercarriage of that reactor."
HUNK says: "So, right then, I was, like, positive."
HUNK says: "Foul play."
EVERYONE says: ""Okay, we get it!"
The remaining Lions chase after ROLO, NYMA, and BEEZER.
Criminals and Lions.
Bargain.
ROLO contacts PROROK through a video transmission.
ROLO says: ""Commander Prorok, my name is Rolo."
ROLO says: "I understand you're offering a reward to anyone helping capture the Voltron Lions."
PROROK says: ""That's correct."
PROROK says: "Do you know where they are?"
ROLO says: ""I know where the blue one is."
ROLO says: "It's in my ship."
PROROK says: ""Excellent."
PROROK says: "Bring it to me and you'll have your reward immediately."
ROLO says: ""Just a tick."
ROLO says: "You see, my friends and I have a bit of a checkered past."
ROLO says: "Some stolen merchandise from the Galra Empire may have fallen into our possession without us knowing about it."
PROROK says: ""Well, I'm sure that a full pardon can be arranged for the brave souls who bring Emperor Zarkon a Voltron Lion."
PROROK says: "Is that all?"
NYMA says: ""We'll take the reward, too."
PROROK says: ""Of course."
ROLO says: ""All right."
ROLO says: "We're on our way."
The transmission ends. ROLO stretches.
ROLO says: ""I almost feel sorry for those Voltron folks."
ROLO says: "Seemed like a nice bunch."
NYMA says: ""If you're feeling guilty, you can turn yourself in."
NYMA says: "Stealing from Zarkon carries a life sentence."
ROLO says: ""They don't seem..."
ROLO says: "that nice."
PROROK stands on his warship and speaks to THACE.
PROROK says: ""Send the nearest fighter squadron to the area of the transmission."
PROROK says: "I'm not trusting some bounty hunter with our prize."
The Chase.
Rolo's alarms start blaring because the remaining Lions are closing in.
ROLO says: ""No way."
ROLO starts to fly his spacecraft to safety.
NYMA says: ""Are you sure you know what you're doing?"
NYMA says: "There's no way we can outrun those Lions."
ROLO says: ""Not in the open."
ROLO says: "Good thing the Zorlar asteroid belt is right up here."
ROLO says: "I know that like the back of my hand."
The criminal aliens fly into the asteroid belt.
PIDGE says: ""We'll never get through this asteroid field!"
HUNK says: ""Maybe I can just bust through!"
HUNK slams the Yellow Lion into an asteroid, causing all the asteroids to bump against each other.
HUNK says: ""Nope."
HUNK says: "That was wrong."
HUNK says: "That was a bad idea."
SHIRO says: ""Keith, you're the only one who could possibly fly through this."
SHIRO says: "We need you, buddy."
SHIRO says: "Get in there and flush him out."
KEITH says: ""You got it."
KEITH says: "See you on the other side."
KEITH pursues ROLO in the Red Lion, navigating the asteroid field easily. ROLO's computer shows the Red Lion nearby.
ROLO says: ""No way."
ROLO says: "Get on the blasters."
ROLO says: "Take him down!"
NYMA says: ""Copy."
NYMA and BEEZER fire the ship's laser blasters at the Red Lion. KEITH dodges the attacks and fires his Lion's mouth cannon in retaliation.
ROLO says: ""This kid can flat-out fly."
NYMA says: ""He's gaining on you!"
ROLO tries tricking KEITH into crashing into an asteroid; KEITH avoids the trick and flings the Red Lion's jaw blade at ROLO's spacecraft. The attack disables the ship's weapons.
NYMA says: ""Blasters are offline!"
ROLO says: ""We've got to get out of here!"
ROLO tries to flee. KEITH fires the Red Lion's mouth cannon at their engines. The criminal's ship is knocked out of the asteroid belt. KEITH catches them with the Red Lion. The other Lions arrive.
KEITH says: ""Yeah!"
KEITH says: "Haha!"
KEITH says: "Hey, Lance, I got your Lion back."
LANCE and KEITH talk through their helmets' communicators.
LANCE says: ""Thank you, Keith."
LANCE says: "Now, can you come and unchain me?"
KEITH says: ""What's that?"
KEITH says: "I, uh..."
KEITH says: "Y-You're cutting out."
KEITH says: "I can't—"
KEITH says: "I can't hear you."
LANCE says: ""Oh, come on!"
LANCE says: "I thought we bonded."
LANCE says: "Keith?"
LANCE says: "Buddy?"
LANCE says: "My man?"
A Criminal's Fate.
The team rescues Lance and returns ROLO and his crew to the alien moon with their broken ship. They stand outside the Castle of Lions.
KEITH says: ""Since your ship really doesn't work now, you'll have to wait here for a rescue."
ROLO says: ""Thanks..."
ROLO says: "for sparing our lives."
HUNK says: ""Now that these guys are dealt with, let's get to the Balmera and save Shay and her family."
ROLO says: ""You may not believe this, but I hope you do stop Zarkon."
ROLO says: ""It's a lifetime of fighting the Galra that led me to where I am today."
The team looks considerate, but does not respond and leaves. Elsewhere, HAGGAR is somewhere in the Galra Empire speaking to a small reptilian creature while holding a canister of Quintessence.
HAGGAR says: ""All this Quintessence will turn you into the strongest, most horrifying fighter ever created."
HAGGAR says: "One that even Voltron will not be able to defeat."
Episode ends.
