SHIRO says: ""Let's hurry up with these repairs."
SHIRO says: "Zarkon could be here at any moment."
HUNK says: ""Okay, panel's off."
HUNK says: "Now, what?"
CORAN says: ""Very simple."
CORAN says: "Just loosen the blaxums on the somoflange."
HUNK says: ""Could you be more specific?"
ALLURA says: ""Sorry, Hunk, he means the poklones on the agroclams."
HUNK says: ""No, that doesn't help."
LANCE says: ""Easy, Hunk."
LANCE says: "I got this."
LANCE says: "Uh-oh."
LANCE says: "That can't be good."
ALLURA says: "" No, not the smalters, the poklones!"
CORAN says: ""No, no!"
CORAN says: "It's the blaxums!"
KEITH says: ""What are you talking about?"
PIDGE says: ""There."
PIDGE says: "Fixed."
ALLURA says: ""Well done, Pidge!"
PIDGE says: ""The tech on this ship never ceases to amaze me."
PIDGE says: "It's so mathematically elegant."
PIDGE says: "Its fit is a 100 times more frictionless than any exoskeleton we have on Earth."
PIDGE says: "It's beautiful."
LANCE says: ""It's not a sunset, Pidge."
PIDGE says: ""You're right."
PIDGE says: "A billion sunsets just happen every day."
PIDGE says: "Some genius engineer actually built this."
HUNK says: "" Kinda looks like a big, delicious curly fry."
SHIRO says: ""What the?"
SHIRO says: "All right, we're prepared for this."
SHIRO says: "Remember your rogue projectile cluster training from the Garrison."
SHIRO says: "First, we need a temporary shelter."
LANCE says: ""Wha?"
LANCE says: "Oh, sorry, Shiro."
LANCE says: "I was trying to hit Keith."
KEITH says: ""Like that?"
HUNK says: ""Yes!"
HUNK says: "Squishy asteroid fight!"
SHIRO says: ""All right, guys."
SHIRO says: "Oh, oh!"
SHIRO says: "Okay, now, it's on!"
LANCE says: ""Oh, come on!"
PIDGE says: ""I don't think these are asteroids."
PIDGE says: "Coran, I'm going to need a containment unit."
CORAN says: ""Just a tick."
ALLURA says: ""They appear to be some sort of hyper-resilient spore."
PIDGE says: ""This bio-luminescent pulsing doesn't seem natural."
PIDGE says: "It appears programmed."
HUNK says: ""I think it's a code."
HUNK says: "A code?"
HUNK says: "From who?"
PIDGE says: ""I don't know."
PIDGE says: "I mean, it makes no sense."
PIDGE says: "You can't program a spore."
SHIRO says: ""If anyone can figure it out, it's you, Pidge."
ALLURA says: ""Before that, everyone needs to come in for decontamination."
CORAN says: ""Keith, did you happen to see a mouse come through here?"
CORAN says: "He has something of mine."
KEITH says: ""Uh n-no."
CORAN says: ""I'll find you, Platt."
KEITH says: ""Wait, Coran!"
KEITH says: "Do you think the Galra ever went to Earth?"
KEITH says: "Is that possible?"
KEITH says: "They would have taken it over, right?"
CORAN says: ""Oh, I think you'd know if the Galra were there."
KEITH says: ""The Blue Lion was there."
KEITH says: "Did a Galra pilot the Blue Lion, too?"
LANCE says: ""Hey, why are you asking about my lion?"
LANCE says: "How many lions do you need?"
KEITH says: ""What?"
KEITH says: "No, I-I was just."
LANCE says: ""Don't "What?"
LANCE says: "No, I-I was just " me!"
LANCE says: "You've had your eye on the Blue Lion from day one!"
KEITH says: ""Well, yeah."
KEITH says: "It's the first one we found."
LANCE says: ""Ah!"
LANCE says: "Bah-bah-bah-bah!"
LANCE says: "The Blue Lion's with me and we're very happy together!"
LANCE says: "Very happy!"
PIDGE says: ""Guys!"
PIDGE says: "Check this out!"
HUNK says: ""Oh, oh!"
HUNK says: "I've seen this experiment."
HUNK says: "But, question: Why do we need to get electricity from a potato?"
PIDGE says: ""What?"
PIDGE says: "No, no."
PIDGE says: "I was able to crack the "sporse code."
PIDGE says: ""  I ran the bioluminescent pattern through a variety of code-breaking sequences, including this homemade virtual Turing machine."
PIDGE says: "Of course, I had to make a few tweaks to the original design, because, obviously, there have been several advancements since he designed it."
PIDGE says: "Although, you have to admit, Turing was a shining light in the world of science in an age when far too many were still."
KEITH says: ""Pidge."
KEITH says: "What does it say?"
PIDGE says: ""Oh, yeah."
PIDGE says: ""Under attack."
PIDGE says: "Galra."
PIDGE says: "Help."
PIDGE says: "" And then, there are coordinates."
SHIRO says: ""It's a distress signal."
SHIRO says: "Good work, Pidge."
SHIRO says: "Get those coordinates into the castle-ship's navigation system."
CORAN says: ""The signal came from Olkarion, home to the Olkari, a proud class of engineers, builders of vast cities that could change shape at the whim of their creators."
ALLURA says: ""They had a seemingly magical ability to manipulate solid metal."
ALLURA says: "With just a wave of their hands, they could build a computer inside a block of steel."
PIDGE says: ""Whoa."
CORAN says: ""An Olkari once gave me this!"
LANCE says: ""What is it?"
CORAN says: ""Uh, hello?"
CORAN says: "It's a floating cube!"
CORAN says: "Oh, this guy."
CORAN says: "And watch!"
CORAN says: "My name is Coran and I'm a gorgeous man."
Cube says: ""My name is Coran and I'm a gorgeous man."
KEITH says: ""Why would a society full of literal tech wizards use spores to send a distress signal?"
PIDGE says: ""Who cares?"
PIDGE says: "When do we get to see that city?"
ALLURA says: ""Actually, Pidge, the distress signal isn't coming from- the city."
ALLURA says: "It's coming from the forest."
PIDGE says: ""Oh Why doesn't anyone ever send a distress signal from a cool place?"
PIDGE says: "I hate the outdoors."
PIDGE says: "Nothing but sunburn and poison oak."
KEITH says: ""I like it out here."
KEITH says: "It's quiet."
HUNK says: ""What was that?"
KEITH says: ""Uh, are we being attacked?"
SHIRO says: ""I don't know, but something's dragging my lion down to the surface."
LANCE says: ""Yeah, something's pulling Blue down, too."
HUNK says: ""Are those wooden mech-suits?"
LANCE says: ""Are you kidding me?"
LANCE says: "We got taken down by a bunch of tree people!"
SHIRO says: ""We come in peace!"
RYNER says: ""Could it be?"
RYNER says: "Voltron?"
PIDGE says: ""We found your distress signal!"
RYNER says: ""Praise Lubos!"
Olkari says: "Lubos!"
Olkari says: "Lubos!"
RYNER says: ""When the Galra attacked, only a few of us escaped the cities."
RYNER says: "We were forced to flee into the forest."
SHIRO says: ""How long have you lived like this?"
GALRA COMMANDER says: ""Many decafeebs."
GALRA COMMANDER says: "But, as you can see, our people are resilient."
GALRA COMMANDER says: "We never stopped evolving."
GALRA COMMANDER says: "Instead, we adapted our skills to the environment."
PIDGE says: ""Coran was right, Ryner."
PIDGE says: "You really are the most incredible engineers in the universe."
PIDGE says: "To be able to switch from working with precision machinery to a bunch of sticks!"
RYNER says: ""Nature's designs are superior to any that we could devise."
PIDGE says: ""No offense, but I'll take my computer over a tree any day."
SHIRO says: ""You two can talk science later."
SHIRO says: "Let's assemble Voltron and get rid of these Galra invaders."
RYNER says: ""It's not that simple, I'm afraid."
RYNER says: "The Galra have our leader, Lubos."
RYNER says: ""If you attack, who knows what they'll do to him?"
SHIRO says: ""Then, we'll just have to rescue him."
GALRA COMMANDER says: ""Work faster!"
GALRA COMMANDER says: "Faster!"
GALRA COMMANDER says: "For a bunch of slaves with magical, metalworking powers, they're taking an awfully long time to build my super weapon."
GALRA COMMANDER says: "Perhaps they need a little bit of- motivation."
GALRA COMMANDER says: "Show them their king!"
LUBOS says: ""No No more!"
LUBOS says: "Please don't hurt me!"
GALRA COMMANDER says: ""That's more like it."
KEITH says: ""Um Ryner, where are we?"
RYNER says: ""This is the armory."
HUNK says: ""Huh?"
LANCE says: ""Cool!"
KEITH says: ""Uh, can I get one of those?"
RYNER says: ""Of course."
RYNER says: "You can each have one."
RYNER says: "Now, the key to operating it is understanding that the nanocellulose responds to electrical impulses from the neural pathways connected through this."
LANCE says: ""Do what now?"
HUNK says: ""Mm."
HUNK says: "Mm!"
HUNK says: "Makes my tongue itchy."
PIDGE says: ""That's your interface?"
RYNER says: ""Of course, all commands need to come as binary coded messages."
PIDGE says: ""So, like this."
RYNER says: ""Yes!"
RYNER says: "Excellent!"
LANCE says: ""I think mine is just a tree."
RYNER says: ""You must have a deep connection with nature."
PIDGE says: ""Not really."
PIDGE says: "My allergies and pale skin don't mix with outdoor living."
SHIRO says: ""Pidge is our resident tech expert."
RYNER says: ""Well, that explains it."
RYNER says: "Like the Olkari, you understand that, at the deepest level, trees, metal, you, me we're all made up of the same cosmic dust, all arranged by the laws of mathematics."
PIDGE says: ""Does this mean I should start gardening?"
RYNER says: ""It means you're going to need to give your friends a ride."
RYNER says: "This way!"
RYNER says: "To the edge of the forest!"
RYNER says: "To save our king!"
GALRA COMMANDER says: ""Finally, the cube is ready for launch."
GALRA COMMANDER says: "Load the top Olkari engineers onto our ships and prepare for departure."
GALRA COMMANDER says: "After the cube destroys Olkarion, hopefully, Zarkon will welcome us back to the main fleet."
RYNER says: ""Their headquarters are impenetrable from the ground, but there is one way in, a small opening in the roof."
RYNER says: "It goes all the way down to an open courtyard."
KEITH says: ""That's quite a drop."
RYNER says: ""But there you will have total access to the building."
RYNER says: "The hard part will be getting onto the roof undetected."
SHIRO says: ""That won't be a problem."
HUNK says: ""Hey, hey, what's that?"
HUNK says: "Is that part of the building?"
RYNER says: ""My Lubos!"
RYNER says: "It can't be!"
PIDGE says: ""Hey!"
PIDGE says: "That looks like the cube Coran gave me!"
RYNER says: ""I haven't seen one of those in many decafeebs."
RYNER says: "We used to play with them as children."
RYNER says: "But this."
RYNER says: "Only King Lubos could have designed one that size."
KEITH says: ""Why would he do that?"
RYNER says: ""They must have forced him to reveal his designs and reconstruct it as a weapon."
RYNER says: "From the looks of it, I'd say it's almost finished."
SHIRO says: ""Okay, we need to act fast."
SHIRO says: "Everyone, back to base."
SHIRO says: "I have a plan."
SHIRO says: "First, we'll need to get to the top of that tower."
SHIRO says: "Since the Green Lion has stealth capabilities, Pidge, you're the drop ship."
SHIRO says: "You'll take Keith, Hunk, Lance, and me to the roof, then drop back to a safe position."
SHIRO says: "After the drop, we'll use a sensor to scan the building for any Olkari biorhythms."
TV says: ""Betrayal!"
TV says: "She loves you!"
SHIRO says: ""King Lubos?"
LUBOS says: ""Yes?"
LUBOS says: "Who are you?"
LUBOS says: "The jesters I requested?"
LANCE says: ""Um, we're here to, like, rescue you?"
LUBOS says: ""Hmm..."
HUNK says: ""You could have just said, "No, thanks."
GALRA COMMANDER says: ""Looks like someone came to rescue you, Lubos."
SHIRO says: ""You turned your back on your people to save your own skin?"
LUBOS says: ""I'm doing this for my people!"
LUBOS says: "They wanted to fight the Galra, but they are too powerful!"
LUBOS says: "The Galra could destroy us!"
LANCE says: ""So, you helped enslave your people to build some super weapon?"
LUBOS says: ""Don't make me the bad guy!"
LUBOS says: "He forced me to do it!"
LANCE says: ""Did he force-feed you, too?"
LUBOS says: ""Uh."
KEITH says: ""You're no king."
Lubos' servant throws him towards Keith, having him being taken forcefully as a hostage.
KEITH says: ""Okay, we're walking out of here!"
KEITH says: "Anyone tries to stop us and Lubos gets it!"
LANCE says: ""Whoa, K-Keith!"
LANCE says: "That came out of nowhere!"
LUBOS says: ""La-sai, what are you doing?"
La-Sai says: ""You betrayed our people."
La-Sai says: "I can't live this lie anymore."
KEITH says: ""You don't want me to hurt your genius engineer, right?"
GALRA COMMANDER says: ""Oh, be my guest."
GALRA COMMANDER says: "His work is done."
GALRA COMMANDER says: "The cube is complete."
LUBOS says: ""What?"
LUBOS says: "But-But I thought we had a deal!"
GALRA COMMANDER says: ""Guards, put them all out of their misery."
PIDGE says: ""Your ride is here!"
GALRA COMMANDER says: ""Engage the cube!"
GALRA COMMANDER says: "Take down the lion!"
SHIRO says: ""The cube is operational!"
SHIRO says: "We've got to get back to the other lions and form Voltron!"
PIDGE says: ""On it!"
RYNER says: ""Lubos What's going on?"
SHIRO says: ""While your countrymen starved, King Lubos was well taken care of by the Galra."
SHIRO says: "He willingly helped them build that cube, willingly helped to enslave his own people."
SHIRO says: ""I know you're devastated, but it's time to be strong and use your Olkari spirit to fight alongside Voltron and take back your planet!"
RYNER says: ""Lubos, how could you?"
RYNER says: ""Enough!"
RYNER says: "We must free our people!"
SHIRO says: ""All right, team, let's take that thing down!"
SHIRO says: "Form shield!"
KEITH says: ""Let's see how tough this magic cube is."
PIDGE says: ""Did it just absorb our lasers?"
SHIRO says: ""We need to increase firepower!"
SHIRO says: "Hunk, use your blaster!"
PIDGE says: ""I'm not sure this is a good idea."
HUNK says: ""Got it!"
HUNK says: "Yeah, I think it's working!"
SHIRO says: ""It's giving back whatever we fire into it, like Coran's echo cube."
PIDGE says: ""That's what I was trying to tell you guys!"
PIDGE says: "It's learning!"
PIDGE says: "Making its own versions of our weapons to use against us!"
LANCE says: ""We can't just sit here."
LANCE says: "We've got to move!"
HUNK says: ""How do we beat it?"
LANCE says: ""Maybe, if we form our sword, we can cut through the surface and hack right into the center thinking point place?"
KEITH says: ""Can't be any worse than what's happening now."
SHIRO says: ""Let's do it."
SHIRO says: "Form sword!"
PIDGE says: ""It's working!"
SHIRO says: ""It's still operational!"
SHIRO says: "Re-engage!"
HUNK says: ""We did it!"
HUNK says: "They're going down!"
LANCE says: ""Uh-oh!"
SHIRO says: ""We've got to move!"
SHIRO says: "Move!"
SHIRO says: "We can't fight them like this!"
SHIRO says: "We need to split up!"
SHIRO says: "Back into lions!"
GALRA COMMANDER says: ""Excellent."
GALRA COMMANDER says: "Voltron doesn't stand a chance against my weapon."
GALRA COMMANDER says: "Soon, I'll have both the cube and Voltron to present to Emperor Zarkon."
LANCE says: ""Let's see if I can freeze these guys!"
LANCE says: "Oh, no!"
LANCE says: "So cold, so cold!"
LANCE says: "- Oh, oh."
LANCE says: "Thanks, Keith."
KEITH says: ""You got it."
HUNK says: ""Shiro, what are we going to do?"
SHIRO says: ""There doesn't seem to be any way to stop them, but we can't let this weapon get into Zarkon's hands!"
SHIRO says: "Pidge!"
RYNER says: ""The Green Lion's in trouble!"
HUNK says: ""Pidge!"
HUNK says: "Are you okay?"
GALRA COMMANDER says: ""Y:Pidge, can you hear me?"
PIDGE says: ""Yeah."
PIDGE says: "Wait."
PIDGE says: "How am I hearing you?"
RYNER says: ""That's not important right now."
RYNER says: "We need to get your lion back up and running."
RYNER says: "I think we can heal your lion's body, but you must bond with its spirit if it is to fly again."
PIDGE says: ""But I thought we bonded already."
RYNER says: ""Your bond must be stronger."
PIDGE says: ""Come on, girl."
PIDGE says: "I need you."
RYNER says: ""Remember what I said."
RYNER says: "You, the lion, the Olkari We are all made of the same essence."
SHIRO says: ""Where are you, Pidge?"
SHIRO says: "We need you!"
KEITH says: ""Pidge!"
PIDGE says: ""Guys, hang on!"
HUNK says: ""Whoa, Pidge!"
HUNK says: "What's going on?"
HUNK says: "You're booking!"
PIDGE says: ""I'm not sure, but I feel more connected with my lion than ever!"
PIDGE says: "I know what I have to do!"
LANCE says: ""Whoa!"
LANCE says: "How'd you do that?"
LANCE says: "That's right!"
PIDGE says: ""Circle up, everybody!"
PIDGE says: "Get some of this!"
HUNK says: ""Vines Well, that is not the way I thought a giant cube of death would go down."
GALRA COMMANDER says: ""No!"
GALRA COMMANDER says: ""Commander, we have to evacuate."
GALRA COMMANDER says: "The cube is down, and the Olkari have taken back the city."
RYNER says: ""I want to thank you all."
RYNER says: "You helped us get our home back."
RYNER says: "And, for that, we will never be able to repay you."
SHIRO says: ""Just promise me that when it's time to take the fight to Zarkon, we can count on the Olkari for help."
SHIRO says: "Now and forever."
SHIRO says: "And you, The spirit of the Olkari resides in you."
SHIRO says: "The bond between you and your lion has grown stronger than ever."
PIDGE says: ""Without you, I would never have been able to unlock my lion's hidden power."
SHIRO says: ""Nice job, Pidge."
PIDGE says: ""You know, it's weird."
PIDGE says: "I've always been a tech junkie."
PIDGE says: "That's how I connected with the world."
PIDGE says: "But, for the first time, I feel connected to everything."
PIDGE says: "I guess it's like Ryner said."
PIDGE says: "We're all made up of the same cosmic dust."
KEITH says: ""So, that means we're all related."
KEITH says: "This ship, those stars, the Olkari."
KEITH says: "Even the Galra."
HUNK says: ""Uh-oh."
HUNK says: "I think Keith just blew his own mind."
HUNK says: "What?"
CORAN says: ""Well, that was a productive trip."
CORAN says: "Look at all these cubes they gave me!"
CORAN says: "Coran, Coran, the gorgeous man!"
CUBES says: ""Coran, Coran, the gorgeous man!"
CUBES says: "- Ah, sounds pretty good."
CORAN says: ""Ah, sounds pretty good."
HUNK says: ""Whoa!"
CORAN says: ""What's that.."
CORAN says: "?"
CORAN says: "Oh, no."
