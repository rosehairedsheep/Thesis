Open on the Krusty Krab. The customers are eating food, Mr. Krabs is painting a picture while humming "Blow the Man Down" and Squidward is manning the cash register.
Mr. Krabs says: "Finished at last!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What do you boys think of my masterpiece?"
SpongeBob says: "New business hours: 6 a."
SpongeBob says: "m."
SpongeBob says: "to 11 p."
SpongeBob says: "m."
Squidward says: "WHAT?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "That is totally unfair!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward's right, that's totally unfair!"
SpongeBob says: "Couldn't we get to work earlier than 6:00 a."
SpongeBob says: "m."
SpongeBob says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Like 5:30 a."
SpongeBob says: "m."
SpongeBob says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Or 5:00 a."

Squidward says: "Zip it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What the..."
Mr. Krabs says: "?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Fish says: "Sure."
Fish says: "I don't know."
Fish says: "Why not?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, he's wrong!"
Fish says: "Oh, okay."
Fish says: "Sure."
Mr. Krabs says: "As of now, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours!"
SpongeBob says: "Did you hear that, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "We get to keep working and working and working without ever having to go home!"
SpongeBob says: "I've got to pinch myself, because I must be dreaming."
Plankton says: "Why aren't you laughing?"
Karen says: "I've heard this joke before."
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, everybody."
Mr. Krabs says: "The Krusty Krab is entering day 3 of non-stop service!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Let's give it up for day 3!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yee haw!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Day 3!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Day 10 of non-stop service!"
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, can I go home yet?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No one goes home!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Quit your bellyaching, Squidward; you don't hear SpongeBob complaining, do you?"
SpongeBob says: "♪K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y, says I."
Mr. Krabs says: "You could learn a few things from that boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, you can sit down for five minutes."
Mr. Krabs says: "Then it's back to work."
Plankton says: "Drat!"
Plankton says: "He's not collapsing from exhaustion!"
Plankton says: "But with a little more pressure, the sponge will crack like an egg!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ew, A spider bug."
Plankton says: "Come on!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Krusty Krab!"
Mr. Krabs says: "The restaurant that never closes."
Mr. Krabs says: "Would you like to place an order?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh huh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Peter Lankton."
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait a minute, this isn't some kind of prank, is it?"
Plankton says: "Eh..."
Plankton says: "no."
Mr. Krabs says: "Good!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We'll call you when it's ready, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Lankton."
Mr. Krabs says: "Kick it into high gear!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We've got a big order!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And I need you to say, "Team Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "Team Krusty Krab!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's me boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, make me 10,000 Krabby Patties."
Mr. Krabs says: "And no breaks!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Day 15!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Give it up for day 15!"
SpongeBob says: "♪K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y..."
SpongeBob says: "1,322..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Day 23!"

Mr. Krabs says: "35..."
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "8,659..."
Old Man Walker says: "Wait, what's going on?"
Old Man Walker says: "Whoa, whoa!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Day..."
Mr. Krabs says: "anyone know how many days it's been?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I've lost track."
Mr. Krabs says: "What the flimflam?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hey, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "When did you get here?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Boy, I'm worried that..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Got it?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Could you run that by me again?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Sure, I said I'm worried that..."
SpongeBob says: "That's what I thought you said."
SpongeBob says: "Now, let me offer this as a rebuttal:  Stay back!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm warning you!"
SpongeBob says: "No, don't eat me!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm too chewy!"
Krabby Patty says: "blarg."
Sally says: "I told you that shirt was hideous."
SpongeBob says: "No, no!"
SpongeBob says: "I want to live!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, what's going on?"
SpongeBob says: "Everywhere I look, I see killer Krabby Patties."
SpongeBob says: "Spatular."
Mr. Krabs says: "and here's the grill."
SpongeBob says: "Grill."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hmm, there may be a problem after all."
SpongeBob says: "What does this mean?"
Mr Krabs says: "It means there's something wrong with your head."
Mr Krabs says: "Look, I think maybe you should see a professional."
SpongeBob says: "Wrestler?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No, a psychiatrist."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, but where am I going to find a psychiatrist?"
SpongeBob says: "Hello?"
SpongeBob says: "Doctor?"
Plankton says: "Come in, Mr."
Plankton says: "SquarePants."
Plankton says: "Please have a seat on the couch."
Plankton says: "Let's unload all that harmful information in your little yellow head."
SpongeBob says: "You're a bit smaller than I imagined, doctor, but I guess that's why they call you shrink."
SpongeBob says: "Do you think there's hope for me, doctor?"
Plankton says: "Hope?"
Plankton says: "Hope!"
Plankton says: "?"
Plankton says: "When I get my hands on that formula, there won't be any hope for any of you!"
Plankton says: "Yeah, I mean, you'll be cured in no time."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, good."
Plankton says: "Let's start with a simple exercise."
SpongeBob says: "Jumping jacks?"
Plankton says: "I want you to close your eyes."
Plankton says: "Too tight!"
Plankton says: "Now, tell me what you see?"
SpongeBob says: "I see giant Krabby Patties!"
Plankton says: "Good, and what are they made of?"
SpongeBob says: "Hatred!"
Plankton says: "No, I mean ingredients."
Plankton says: "What are the stinking ingredients?!"
Plankton says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "They're coming for me."
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "Stay back!"
Plankton says: "Wait, where'd you get that piano?"
Plankton says: "We're trying something else."
Plankton says: "I'm going to say a word and I want you to say the first word that pops into your head."
Plankton says: "Ready?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm ready!"
Plankton says: "Work."
SpongeBob says: "Work."
Plankton says: "Spatula."
SpongeBob says: "Spatula."
Plankton says: "Bun."
SpongeBob says: "Bun."
Plankton says: "See, the key is to say something different to what I say."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, okay, I've got it."
Plankton says: "Potato."
SpongeBob says: "Potahto."
Plankton says: "Tomato."
SpongeBob says: "Tomahto."
Plankton says: "I've laid out some words on cards here."
Plankton says: "These words are common kitchen ingredients."
Plankton says: "I want you to arrange them in any order you choose."
Plankton says: "It could be a poem or a secret formula."
Plankton says: "I don't know… oh, yes!"
Plankton says: "A secret formula."
Plankton says: "Good, let's do that."
SpongeBob says: "Um, you're making me nervous."
Plankton says: "Oh, okay."
Plankton says: "I'll be over here, then."
SpongeBob says: "I'm finished!"
Plankton says: "Since your mind has been resistant to every mental technique so far, I'm forced to resort to my most powerful method of curing you."
SpongeBob says: "Fiber?"
Plankton says: "No, hypnosis."
SpongeBob says: "Hypnosis?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Plankton says: "Why won't you wake up?!"
Plankton says: "!"
We peer into SpongeBob's dream. In it, he is chasing jellyfish, but then gets caught in a fishnet by a huge Krabby Patty, who then eats him. Inside the Krabby Patty, SpongeBob looks around in the dark.
SpongeBob says: "Where am I?"
Krabby Patty says: "Hey, SpongeBob."
Krabby Patty says: "I heard your brain was sick, so I brought you this cookie pizza."
SpongeBob says: "Gee, thanks!"
Krabby Patty says: "And here's some chocolate milk."
SpongeBob says: "The king of flavored dairy drinks!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Krabby Patty, I'm so glad we're friends again."
Krabby Patty says: "Just remember, SpongeBob, I'll always be with you right here."
SpongeBob says: "In my heart?"
Krabby Patty says: "Actually, in your arteries."
Krabby Patty says: "Now, do me a favor and wake up."
Krabby Patty says: "Wake up."
Plankton says: "WAAAAAAAKE UUUUUUUUUP!!!"
SpongeBob says: "It worked!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm cured!"
Plankton says: "But what about the formula?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, you're right!"
SpongeBob says: "I'd better get back to work!"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for everything, doc!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Good to see you're brain's all fixed, boy."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, I just needed some sleep, is all."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, I can safely say, "No more 24 hour shifts", because 23 hours will be plenty!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs..."
SpongeBob says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "No, seriously."
Mr. Krabs says: "Get back to work!"
