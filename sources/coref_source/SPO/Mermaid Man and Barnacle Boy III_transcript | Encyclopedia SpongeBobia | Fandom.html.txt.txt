Man Ray says: "Aren't you Patrick Star?"
Patrick says: "Yup."
Man Ray says: "And this is your ID."
Patrick says: "Yup."
Man Ray says: "I found this ID in this wallet."
Man Ray says: "And if that's the case, this must be your wallet."
Patrick says: "That makes sense to me."
Man Ray says: "Then take it."
Patrick says: "It's not my wallet."

Man Ray says: "Stop!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good."
Patrick says: "Let go of it, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Pat, we've got to use it only when he's bad!"

SpongeBob says: "He said the P word."
Patrick says: "Peanuts?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Please."
Patrick says: "Well, that's good enough for me."
Patrick says: "I guess he's reconstituted."
SpongeBob says: "Rehabilitated."
Patrick says: "Gesundheit."
SpongeBob says: "It's graduation day, Man Ray."
SpongeBob says: "This is the key to your future."
SpongeBob says: "Thooose!"

SpongeBob says: "Wow, we did it!"
SpongeBob says: "Just like the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!"
SpongeBob says: "We saved the day!"
SpongeBob says: "Isn't it incredible, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
