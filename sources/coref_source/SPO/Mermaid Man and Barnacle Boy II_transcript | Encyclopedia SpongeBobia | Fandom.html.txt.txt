The exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple is shown.
French Narrator says: "Ah,  and wearing the official Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy breakfast biters."
TV Announcer says: "Mermaid Man..."
Mermaid Man says: "To the chiropractor!"
Mermaid Man says: "Away!"
A live action glove of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy come together and transition to the next scene, which features a spotlight of cardboard cutouts of the Sinister Slug, Atomic Flounder, and Jumbo Shrimp.
Johnny Elaine says: "Hey, kids, are you ready to hear the winner of this week's contest?"
The scene cuts to SpongeBob. He grabs his TV.
SpongeBob says: "I'm ready!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm ready!"
The scene cuts to show a close up of the TV, which has a close up of Johnny Elaine.
Johnny Elaine says: "Our winner will receive a special secret collector's  SpringBoob SquirePin."
The scene cuts back to SpongeBob, who now has Gary next to him.
SpongeBob says: "Aw."
SpongeBob says: "I worked forever on those life-size Krabby Patty mannequins of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy."
The scene cuts back to back to the TV, where Johnny Elaine is in front of the Krabby Patty mannequins.
Johnny Elaine says: "..."
Johnny Elaine says: "for these life-size Krabby Patty mannequins of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy."
The scene cuts back to SpongeBob and Gary.
SpongeBob says: "Hey!"
SpongeBob says: "SpringBoob SquirePin stole my idea!"
The scene cuts back to the TV, where Johnny Elaine is in front of the watery background again.
Johnny Elaine says: "SpongeBob SquarePants!"
The scene cuts to the exterior of the pineapple.
SpongeBob says: "I wonder if it still works."
SpongeBob runs to window and blows into it. The scene cuts to the exterior of Shady Shoals as the conch signal continues. It then cuts to Mermaid Man, who is sleeping and Barnacle Boy, sitting on their couch, inside. Mermaid Man wakes up.
Mermaid Man says: "The conch signal!"
Mermaid Man says: "To the Invisible Boatmobile!"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy then jump back into their seats. The couch turns around and the run, reveals an underground passage way. The couch's back bends backwards, sending them down a slide.
Mermaid Man says: "Ah!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Ah!"
Mermaid Man says: "Ooh!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Ooh!"
Mermaid Man says: "Oh!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Oh!"
Mermaid Man says: "Oh!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Oh!"
Mermaid Man says: "Ah!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Ah!"
Mermaid Man says: "Ah!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Ah!"
Mermaid Man says: "Ooh!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Ooh!"
The two then start falling downwards, upright because the slide corrected their position, into the Mermalair. Their butts start to catch fire. The two stop in mid-air, which puts out the fire.
Barnacle Boy says: "Uh, Mermaid Man?"
Mermaid Man says: "Yes, Barnacle Boy?"
Barnacle Boy says: "We're not in the Invisible Boatmobile, are we?"
Mermaid Man says: "Uh, Nope."
The two fall onto the ground and stand up. They walk around, holding out their hands to look for the Invisible Boatmobile.
Barnacle Boy says: "I told you making the boatmobile invisible was a stupid idea."
Mermaid Man says: "Boatmobile!"
Mermaid Man says: "Come out, come out, wherever you are."
Barnacle Boy says: "It's gotta be here somewhere?"
Barnacle Boy says: "I think I..."
Mermaid Man says: "We don't have all day."
Barnacle Boy sits down.
Barnacle Boy says: "Ignition..."
Barnacle Boy says: "on."
Mermaid Man says: "Throttle..."
Mermaid Man says: "on."
The Invisible Boatmobile goes through a corridor. The exterior of Shady Shoals is shown. The ramp leading to the front goes up, and the Invisible Boatmoble flies out of it. It then goes around a corner. The scene cuts back to SpongeBob.
SpongeBob says: "Hmm."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe the conch signal doesn't work anymore."
Gary meows. An entire roaring, then a tire screeching, then a cat screeching are heard outside.
Mermaid Man says: "Mermaid Man..."
Barnacle Boy's head crashes through the door, causing the wheel on the interior to fall off.
Barnacle Boy says: "..."
Barnacle Boy says: "and Bob-acle..."
The door falls on the ground with Barnacle Boy's head still in it.
SpongeBob says: "I can't believe it, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in our home."
SpongeBob runs to the door and Gary meows. Mermaid Man dusts off Barnacle Boy.
SpongeBob says: "Excuse me, I'm..."
Mermaid Man says: "Oh, my Neptune!"
Mermaid Man says: "He's been horribly disfigured!"
Mermaid Man says: "Oh, blast us!"
Mermaid Man says: "We're too late!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Oh, please."
Barnacle Boy says: "He's not disfigured."
Barnacle Boy says: "He's-he's just that sponge kid again."
Mermaid Man says: "Oh, yeah."
Mermaid Man says: "Good to see you, lad."
Mermaid Man says: "Say, Barnacle Boy, we gotta find out where that conch signal came from."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, that was me."
SpongeBob says: "I blew the conch signal, sir."
Mermaid Man says: "Alright."
Mermaid Man says: "Where's the danger, son?"
Mermaid Man says: "Bring it on."
Mermaid Man says: "Bring it on!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry."
SpongeBob says: "There's no danger."
Mermaid Man says: "No danger?"
Barnacle Boy says: "No danger?"
Barnacle Boy says: "Look, there has to be danger."
Barnacle Boy says: "You blew the conch signal."
Barnacle Boy says: "When you blow the..."
Barnacle Boy says: "where'd you get that thing anyway?"
SpongeBob says: "I won it in a contest."
Mermaid Man says: "Contest?"
Barnacle Boy says: "Contest?"
Mermaid Man says: "They don't tell us anything anymore."
Barnacle Boy says: "Look, Spongy, that ain't no toy."
Mermaid Man says: "That's right."
Mermaid Man says: "The conch signal is an awesome responsibility."
Mermaid Man says: "We're duty-bound to help whenever it sounds."
Barnacle Boy says: "But you only blow it when there's trouble, or there'll be trouble."
Barnacle Boy says: "You got that?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, sirs!"
Mermaid Man says: "Good boy."
Mermaid Man pats SpongeBob on the head. He and Barnacle Boy leave. Mermaid Man turns back and he and SpongeBob point at each other and make a clicking noise.
Barnacle Boy says: "Come on, come on,  come on."
Barnacle Boy says: "They're serving meatloaf today."
Mermaid Man walks out the door.
Mermaid Man says: "Oh, goody."
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Mermaid Man."
SpongeBob says: "You won't be hearing from me for just anything."
SpongeBob says: "Only for the big emergencies."
The bubble transition goes to the interior of Shady Shoals, where Barnacle Boy, who is wearing a swimsuit, bangs on the bathroom door.
Barnacle Boy says: "Will you hurry up in there?"
Barnacle Boy says: "And save me some hot wat..."
The conch signal is heard. Mermaid Man, who is wearing a towel, kicks down the door, which lands on top of Barnacle Boy.
Mermaid Man says: "The conch signal!"
Mermaid Man says: "Come, young ward!"
Mermaid Man runs away.
Barnacle Boy says: "Coming!"
Mermaid Man jumps onto the couch. Barnacle Boy, holding his swimsuit, wobbles onto the chair. Because the two entered the couch too quickly, a spring goes back and springs them forward through the rug, down onto the slide. They slide down on their faces first, and Mermaid Man's towel flies off. The whirlpool transition shows a bird's eye-view of SpongeBob's living room. He is laying on the ground with his eyes shut and his tongue out. Gary is next to him. There is also a spot light on him. The tire squealing and the cat shrieking is heard. The angle changes. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy run into the living room. Mermaid Man stands behind Gary and Barnacle Boy gives Mermaid Man a new towel. Gary crawls away.
Mermaid Man says: "Oh..."
Mermaid Man says: "youth!"
Mermaid Man says: "Cut down in its prime!"
Mermaid Man says: "Oh, speak to me, son."
Mermaid Man picks SpongeBob up.
SpongeBob says: "Help..."
SpongeBob says: "Can't..."
SpongeBob says: "open mayonnaise."
Barnacle Boy says: "What?!"
Barnacle Boy says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "But..."
Barnacle Boy says: "But nothing!"
Barnacle Boy says: "We can't go around socializing."
Barnacle Boy says: "We have to be prepared for, uh, emergencies."
Mermaid Man says: "Barnacle Boy, think about it."
Mermaid Man says: "Emergencies don't come around as often as they used to."
Barnacle Boy says: "Alright, okay."
Barnacle Boy says: "You can blow the conch every once in a while."
Barnacle Boy says: "Just give us  show up."
SpongeBob says: "Yay!"
Mermaid Man says: "Yay!"
The bubble transition goes to the Shady Shoals Rest Home cafeteria, where Barnacle Boy is eating soup. The conch signal blows as he grabs a spoon full of soup. He blows on it and Mermaid Man grabs Barnacle Boy's arm, while running, which causes him to drop the spoon.
Mermaid Man says: "Danger!"
At SpongeBob's house, in his bathroom, Mermaid Man fixes SpongeBob's sink and Barnacle boy unclogs SpongeBob's shower drain. SpongeBob is shown blowing the conch signal. It then cuts to the library, where Mermaid Man is on a ladder, holding a book, and Mermaid Man is holding Mermaid Man's butt, so that he doesn't fall. SpongeBob is shown blowing the conch signal. It cuts to the living room, where he is in a barber's chair, reading the newspaper, Mermaid Man is shining SpongeBob's shoes, and Barnacle Boy is giving him a head massage. It then cuts to SpongeBob, at night, on his house, using the conch signal. It then cuts to SpongeBob, in bed, next to a teddy bear. Mermaid Man is reading a book and Barnacle Boy is holding milk and plate of cookies. It cuts to SpongeBob blowing the conch signal three different times. On the last time, Barnacle Boy takes it out of SpongeBob's mouth.
Barnacle Boy says: "That's it!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Gimme that!"
Barnacle Boy says: "You're running us ragged."
Mermaid Man says: "Must..."
Mermaid Man says: "must answer clarion call!"
Mermaid Man collapses.
Barnacle Boy says: "We're exhausted!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Barnacle Boy."
SpongeBob says: "I didn't mean it."
SpongeBob says: "I..."
SpongeBob says: "just wanted to spend time with you."
SpongeBob says: "You're my heroes!"
SpongeBob starts crying.
Barnacle Boy says: ", uh, Mermalair."
Barnacle Boy says: "Uh, and as for you..."
Mermaid Man says: "Barnacle Boy,  whipper-snapper, who wanted to be a super-hero."
Mermaid Man chuckles.
Barnacle Boy says: "You don't even remember breakfast, you old coot."
Mermaid Man walks up to SpongeBob, still crying.
Mermaid Man says: "Maybe the conch signal is too much responsibility."
Mermaid Man says: "But how would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon on patrol?"
Barnacle Boy says: "What?"
The scene fades to later. Barnacle Boy is still angry.
SpongeBob says: "Oh..."
SpongeBob says: "Jingle bells, Mermaid Man smells,  lost a wheel and..."
Mermaid Man says: "Jingle bells, Mermaid Man smells,  lost a wheel and..."
SpongeBob says: "Hey,  can I drive?"
Barnacle Boy says: "Drive?"
Barnacle Boy says: "What do you know about driving the Invisible Boatmobile?"
SpongeBob says: "Tons!"
SpongeBob says: "Like the windshield wipers are right here."
Barnacle Boy says: "Don't touch that button, that's the..."
Barnacle Boy says: "!"
Barnacle Boy says: "..."
Barnacle Boy says: "Origami button."
SpongeBob says: "Hey!"
SpongeBob says: "I've got the doughnuts!"
SpongeBob says: "..."
Mermaid Man says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "and Barnacle Boy laid an egg."
Mermaid Man says: "and Barnacle Boy laid an egg."
SpongeBob says: "Hey-hey!"
Mermaid Man says: "Hey-hey!"
Mermaid Man says: "Oh, that fellow over there used to be the Atomic Flounder."
Mermaid Man says: "I know he doesn't look like much, but he could go back to crime..."
Atomic Flounder says: "Help!"
Atomic Flounder says: "Help!"
Atomic Flounder says: "Help somebody there!"
SpongeBob says: "You're under arrest, Atomic Flounder."
Mermaid Man says: "Stop, kid."
Mermaid Man says: "Stop!"
Mermaid Man says: "Let him go."
SpongeBob says: "But you said he could snap..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "just like that."
Atomic Flounder says: "What?!"
Atomic Flounder says: "!"
Atomic Flounder says: "Get off of me!"
Atomic Flounder says: "Out of my way, punk!"
At The Diner.
SpongeBob says: "I can't believe it: I rode in the Invisible Boatmobile, met a villain, and learned to treat third-degree burns, all in one day."
SpongeBob says: "So, what are we going to do tomorrow."
Barnacle Boy says: "Uh, uh, say, kid, why don't you take this nickel and go up there and see if our theme song in on the jukebox?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
Mermaid Man says: "You know, for a pain in the neck, he's a pretty nice kid."
Barnacle Boy says: "Let's ditch him."
Mermaid Man says: "I'm right behind you."
SpongeBob says: "It doesn't seem to be here."
Barnacle Boy says: "Oh, it's there, all right."
Mermaid Man says: "Keep looking."
Mermaid Man says: "Diligence."
Mermaid Man says: "Diligence."
SpongeBob says: "Aye, aye, sir."
Barnacle Boy says: "Dagnabbit."
Mermaid Man says: "What's the matter?"
Barnacle Boy says: "Where did we park the Invisible Boatmobile?"
SpongeBob says: "Aw, that's the 15th time I've looked."
Mermaid Man says: "Boatmobile, where are you?"
Barnacle Boy says: "It's the Dirty Bubble!"
