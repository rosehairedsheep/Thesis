A sign that says "Fine Antiques For Sale" is put in Mr. Krabs' front yard. Mr. Krabs assembles a rug for the "antiques" to be put in.
French Narrator says: "Ah, a yard sale."
French Narrator says: "You know the old saying: "One man's trash is another man's treasure."
Narrator says: "For Mr."
Narrator says: "Krabs, all trash is treasure."
Mr. Krabs says: "Open for business."
Mr. Krabs says: "See anything you like?"
Fish #1 says: "Yeah, I'll give you a buck fifty for this umbrella."
Mr. Krabs says: "A buck fifty for that?"
Mr. Krabs says: "But it's an antique!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It belonged to a queen."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ten bucks."
Fish #1 says: "Ten bucks?"
Fish #1 says: "But it's full of holes."
Mr. Krabs says: "It was the queen of Switzerland."
Fish #1 says: "A queen you say?"
Fish #1 says: "That's-- Wait a second!"
Fish #1 says: "They don't have a queen!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Bargain Hunter, five bucks."

Patrick says: "Whatcha you doing?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm having an antique sale."
Mr. Krabs says: "Have a look around."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick, look at this thing."
SpongeBob says: "Pretty cool, huh?"
Patrick says: "That looks like the toilet plunger I threw out yesterday."
Mr. Krabs says: "..."
Mr. Krabs says: "a 17th-century soup ladle, see?"
Patrick says: "Man, was I using mine wrong."
Patrick says: "How much?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Five bucks."
Patrick says: "I only got seven."
Mr. Krabs says: "Deal."
Patrick says: "Patrick Star, you are one smart shopper."
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "Look at this neat-o soda drinking hat."
SpongeBob says: "It must've belonged to someone who was number 1."
SpongeBob says: "There's only been a handful of number ones in the history of forever."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's right, SpongeBob, and you're one of 'em."
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
Mr. Krabs says: "This hat says, "Hey, I'm number 1, and I let gravity do my drinking."
Mr. Krabs says: "" This hat was made for you, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "You were born to wear this hat."
SpongeBob says: "Ee-hee, ooh..."
SpongeBob says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "A perfect fit, eh, son?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, thank you, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Thank you for bringing us together!"
SpongeBob says: "How can I ever repay you?"
Mr. Krabs says: "With 10 dollars."
SpongeBob says: "All I have is 5."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, I guess it's no deal."
SpongeBob says: "I'll be right back."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I found 68 cents."
SpongeBob says: "But maybe you can take the other $4."
SpongeBob says: "32 out of my paycheck!"
SpongeBob says: "What do you say?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well-- I don't know..."
Mr. Krabs says: "uh, okay!"
Mr. Krabs says: "But only because you look so dashing in that hat."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't mention it, boys."
Mr. Krabs says: "What a couple of rubes."
Fish #2 says: "Excuse me, sir, but are you the purveyor of this curio stand?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes, I am."
Fish #2 says: "I understand you're selling this rare novelty drink hat."
Mr. Krabs says: "Fresh out."
Fish #2 says: "Let me explain."
Fish #2 says: "I'm prepared to give you $500 for that drink hat."
Mr. Krabs says: "Fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-..."
Fish #3 says: "Not so fast."
Nat says: "I'll give you $100,000, in cash, for said hat."
Mr. Krabs says: "There he is with me million dollar hat."
Mr. Krabs says: "I gotta get it back before he finds out how much it's worth."
SpongeBob says: "Ah!"
SpongeBob says: "My bubble production has increased two-fold, thanks to you, Hatty."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "K."
SpongeBob says: "How's the antique biz treating you?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, never mind that."
Mr. Krabs says: "Listen, I didn't want to say this in front of Patrick, but that hat makes you look like a girl."
SpongeBob says: "Am I a pretty girl?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, well, um..."
Mr. Krabs says: "you're..."
Mr. Krabs says: "you're beautiful."
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, now give me the hat back."
SpongeBob says: "But, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, you said it yourself..."
SpongeBob says: "I was born to wear this hat."
SpongeBob says: "I don't want to give it back."
SpongeBob says: "I can't get rid of this hat now."
SpongeBob says: "Not after all that we've been through."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I'll call you Hatty."
SpongeBob says: "And that's when you showed up."
Mr. Krabs says: "Aw, forget it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And you're not beautiful, either."
SpongeBob says: "I'm not?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Just the man I wanted to see."
Mr. Krabs says: "Still playing with that dumb old hat, eh?"
SpongeBob says: "Yep."
Mr. Krabs says: "Not sick of that boring old hat, yet?"
SpongeBob says: "Nope."
Mr. Krabs says: "Not even a little tired of that old piece of junk?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh-uh."
Mr. Krabs says: "Not even a teensy-tiny bit?"
SpongeBob says: "Nope."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, then I guess you don't want to see what's in my bag."
SpongeBob says: "What is it?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Novelty hats."
SpongeBob says: "Seems a little dangerous."
Mr. Krabs says: "The juicer."
SpongeBob says: "Ooh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Foxy Grandpa?"
Mr. Krabs says: "So, what do you say?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Your silly hat for all these hats?"
SpongeBob says: "No deal, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sticking with Hatty."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for the offer, though."
Mr. Krabs says: "I thought the Foxy Grandpa would get him for sure."
Mr. Krabs says: "I didn't want to have to do this, but he leaves me no other option."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, my gosh!"
SpongeBob says: "A floating shopping list!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm not a shopping list..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm a ghost!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, listen, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "How do you know my name?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Who are you?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I am the ghost of soda drink hats."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm here to tell you that that soda drinking hat you possess is cursed."
SpongeBob says: "Cursed?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes."
Mr. Krabs says: "It once belonged to some guy who's dead now."
SpongeBob says: "What guy?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Smitty something."
SpongeBob says: "Smitty what?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Smitty Werben..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Jaegerman..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Jensen."
SpongeBob says: "He must've been number one."
Mr. Krabs says: "Number one in Boogeyland!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, listen, a curse will descend on you unless you return that hat to its owner immediately."
SpongeBob says: "Immediately?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Immediately..."
SpongeBob says: "To its owner?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes..."
SpongeBob says: "Right now?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes, yes!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It must be returned to its owner, right now."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ahh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you doing here?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I was just returning the cursed soda-drink hat to its original owner: Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen."
Mr. Krabs says: "What?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "There is no Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen!"
SpongeBob says: "Sure there is."
SpongeBob says: "He's buried out in Floater's Cemetery."
Mr. Krabs says: "How did?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I just..."
Mr. Krabs says: "You did..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I would..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Gimme that shovel."
SpongeBob says: "It was his hat, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "He was number 1!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Remember, licking doorknobs is illegal on other planets."
Mr. Krabs says: "No, not that!"
SpongeBob says: "You'll never guess what I found in my sock last night!"
SpongeBob says: "Go ahead, guess!"
SpongeBob says: "It was his hat, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Smitty says: "Hey, man, that's my hat."
Smitty says: "Give it back."
Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No way."
Mr. Krabs says: "Just crawl back into your hole, bone boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Go ahead, play dead."
Smitty says: "I guess I'm gonna have to take it from you."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, right."
Mr. Krabs says: "You and what army?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, no."
Mr. Krabs says: "I've seen this on the late show."
Mr. Krabs says: "You ghoulish fiends hold me down and take turns nibbling on my innards."
Mr. Krabs says: "Then you eat my brain and leave my body for the buzzards."
Smitty says: "That's disgusting!"
Smitty says: "We just want the hat back."
Mr. Krabs says: "No flipping way!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Back off!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Back off, I say."
Smitty says: "Attack."
Mr. Krabs says: "Tallyho!"
Fred says: "Yeah, you want that all at once?"
Fish #3 says: "One million dollars."
Fish #3 says: "You gotta be kidding!"
Nat says: "Hey!"
Nat says: "The poor sap's not kidding."
Nat says: "Didn't you hear?"
Nat says: "They found a whole warehouse full of them."
Nat says: "They're worthless."
SpongeBob says: "Let's give Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs a big hand."
Nat says: "Now that's worth a million dollars."
Nat says: "Hey, kid, wait up!"
Fish #2 says: "I saw him first!"
Fish #3 says: "I'll give you one billion dollars!"
Fred rows his row-boat along the ground to chase SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, that's a spirit breaker."
