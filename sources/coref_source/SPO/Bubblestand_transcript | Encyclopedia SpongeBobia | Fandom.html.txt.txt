Squidward says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Wanna blow some bubbles?"
SpongeBob says: "Only 25 cents."
Squidward says: "Oh, right."
Squidward says: "Like I would spend a moment of my time blowing bubbles."
SpongeBob says: "Uh huh."
Squidward says: "Oh, puh-lease."
Squidward says: "I mean, who in the world would pay to blow bubbles?"
Patrick says: "Good morning."
Squidward says: "Oh, boy."
SpongeBob says: "Good morning to you, sir."
SpongeBob says: "Would you care to blow a bubble?"
Patrick says: "Hmm, how much is it?"
SpongeBob says: "Only a quarter."
Patrick says: "Sounds reasonable."
Patrick says: "Uh, I'm going to need to borrow a quarter."
SpongeBob says: "Sure thing, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Ah, one quarter."
SpongeBob says: "Thank you."
Squidward says: "Hmm, business is booming."
SpongeBob says: "One bubble wand, dipped and ready to go."
SpongeBob says: "Could I interest you in some lessons?"
SpongeBob says: "Only 25 cents."
Patrick says: "Uh, very well, then."
Patrick says: "Hey, Sponge, can I borrow another quarter?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Patrick, it's all in the technique."
Patrick says: "Oooh."
Squidward says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "And now..."
SpongeBob says: "with two hands!"
Squidward says: "Don't give me any of that!"
Squidward says: "How can you two possibly make all this noise just blowing bubbles?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "We're not just blowing bubbles."
SpongeBob says: "We're making bubble art."
SpongeBob says: "Watch carefully."
Squidward says: "That's not art."
Squidward says: "That's just annoying."
Squidward says: "Blowing bubbles, that's the lamest idea I have ever heard."
SpongeBob says: "That'll be 25 cents, sir."
Squidward says: "Ah, whoa, what?"
Squidward says: "Oh..."
Squidward says: "who-who would pay 25 cents to blow bubbles?"
SpongeBob says: "We also offer lessons for beginners."
Squidward says: "Beginners?"
Squidward says: "What could be more simple than blowing a stupid bubble?"
