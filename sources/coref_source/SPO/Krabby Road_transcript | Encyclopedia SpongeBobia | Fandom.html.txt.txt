Episode begins in front of the Bikini Bottom Jail during a bad thunderstorm.
Frank says: "…and this is the maximum security level."
Frank says: "Since this is your first day, I'll let you peek at our number one inmate."
Frank says: "He's too dangerous to let him around the other inmates."
Police Officer says: "Why?"
Police Officer says: "What he'd do?"
Police Officer says: "Rob a bank?"
Frank says: "Worse!"
Frank says: "He'd tried to steal the Krabby Patty formula."
Police Officer says: "Oh!"
Police Officer says: "Oh-kay."
Frank says: "So that's why we keep him behind these impenetrable 6-inch steel doors."
Frank says: "He's gone!"
Frank says: "He's so small, he could be anywhere!"
Police Officer says: "He could be right under our noses!"
Police Officer says: "Umm… Frank, where's your mustache?"
Cut to outside of the jail, with the siren sound heard and spotlights everywhere. The mustache run through the halls and then under the door. Plankton pops off the mustache.
Plankton says: "Ha-ha!"
Plankton says: "Those fools will never find me now!"
Plankton says: "Ah, come on, baby."
Plankton says: "You know how long I've been in stir."
Karen says: "Get out!"
Karen says: "And stay out!"
Karen says: "You two time loser!"
Plankton says: "After everything I've done for you?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Karen says: "Beat it, you jailbird, and take all your junk, too!"
Plankton says: "Well, that's just great."
Plankton says: "You know, I don't think I've had any good times."
SpongeBob says: "♪Then I mix some of this and put it over there, as I write this song."
Plankton says: "He's singing about the Krabby Patty."
Plankton says: "If I could just get him to explain that song, I'll have the Krabby Patty formula!"
Plankton says: "Hi, SpongeBob."
Plankton says: "That's a real nice song."
Plankton says: "But could you explain those "wee" parts?"
SpongeBob says: "♪And when I'm done, I chop up some… Love."
Plankton says: "Are you out of your mind?"
Plankton says: "Er, I mean, that was a delightful song you were singing."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Plankton."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs makes me censor out all the patty ingredients from my lyrics."
Plankton says: "Oh, that's terrible."
Plankton says: "Krabs shouldn't stifle a true artist like you!"
Plankton says: "Go ahead and sing your patty song uncensored!"
SpongeBob says: "I know what you're doing!"
Plankton says: "What, me?"
Plankton says: "I'm not trying to steal the patty formula!"
SpongeBob says: "You want me to… join your band!"
Plankton says: "What band?"
Plankton says: "I don't have a band."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, but you can't fool me!"
SpongeBob says: "Not when you got an awesome guitar like that!"
SpongeBob says: "And only a true rocker would have hair as greasy and nasty as yours."
SpongeBob says: "It'll be so cool!"
SpongeBob says: "We could write songs together!"
Plankton says: "Songs?"
Plankton says: "Yes!"
Plankton says: "And you could teach me your Krabby Patty songs!"
SpongeBob says: "Yay!"
SpongeBob says: "Come on, let's go get our band together!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I've got big news!"
Patrick says: "Me, too!"
Patrick says: "Me, too!"
SpongeBob says: "What's your news?"
SpongeBob says: "Ew, really?"
Patrick says: "Uh-huh."
Patrick says: "What's your news?"
SpongeBob says: "Plankton just asked me to join his Rock-N-Roll band!"
SpongeBob says: "Can Patrick join our band?"
Plankton says: "Sure, whatever."
SpongeBob says: "Hear that, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "You're in."
Patrick says: "All right!"
Patrick says: "I play a mean belly."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, Patrick, we're gonna be famous!"
Squidward says: "Give me a break."
Squidward says: "You don't know anything about music!"
Squidward says: "Too bad you're not a musical genius, like me."
SpongeBob says: "Would you help us by joining our band?"
SpongeBob says: "Isn't this great, Plankton?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward is gonna help us!"
Plankton says: "Hmm?"
Plankton says: "Uh, yeah, great."
SpongeBob says: "You know, Patrick, being in a band gives you the liberty to dress with a little more… Uh, how should I put this?"
Patrick says: "Yeah?"
Patrick says: "Go ahead, say it, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "You know, pizzazz!"
Patrick says: "Perhaps you didn't notice… My new hairdo."
SpongeBob says: "Whoa-ho-ho, I stand corrected!"
SpongeBob says: "Man, how'd you grow that so fast?"
SpongeBob says: "Whoo, yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Dig that fancy follicle work!"
Patrick says: "Hey, check this one out."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, man, Squidward's not gonna want to miss this."
Squidward says: "Hello?"
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Aren't you coming to band practice?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Patrick says: "I'm on it."
Plankton says: "Greetings, fellow band-mates."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Plankton, what's that?"
Plankton says: "T-shirts."
Both says: "Ooh!"
Both says: "Oh, boy!"
Both says: "Oh, boy!"
Both says: "Oh, boy!"
SpongeBob says: "Ah…  "Plankton and the… Patty Stealers"?"
SpongeBob says: "I..."
SpongeBob says: "love it!"
SpongeBob says: "It's kind of vague and mysterious."
Patrick says: "Can I get mine in pink?"
Patrick says: "It looks like a tattoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Plankton, can our first song go like this?"
Plankton says: "Yes, perfect."
Plankton says: "Now all we need are the lyrics."
Plankton says: "You know something personal."
Plankton says: "Maybe a secret you know, or a favorite recipe, hmm?"
SpongeBob says: "Or..."
SpongeBob says: "One about my new friend Plankton?"
Plankton says: "Stop it!"
SpongeBob says: "Or the ventures of wholesome..."
Plankton says: "Secret recipe."
Patrick says: "I once searched for my innermost secrets."
Patrick says: "All I found was this."
SpongeBob says: "Is that what you mean, Plankton?"
Plankton slaps his head with annoyance. Scene skips to later that day when Plankton pulls a machine into the garage, grunting as he pulls it.
SpongeBob says: "What is that?"
Plankton says: "It's my..."
Plankton says: "uh..."
Plankton says: "recording equipment."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, my gosh!"
SpongeBob says: "What do I do?"
SpongeBob says: "♪Time to feed him."
SpongeBob says: "Time to feed him."
SpongeBob says: "Now it's Gary's feeding time."
SpongeBob says: "Mrow mrow meow, mrow mrow meow."
Plankton says: "Nope."
SpongeBob says: "♪Brush, brush, brush my teeth."
SpongeBob says: "Gently keep them clean."
Plankton says: "The Krabby Patty Formula's gotta be in here somewhere."
Plankton says: "I'm a failure."
SpongeBob says: "Cheer up, Plankton."
SpongeBob says: "We've still got a whole week before our first gig at the Krusty Krab."
Plankton says: "At the Krusty Krab?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh-huh, but old man Krabs doesn't want us bugging the customers."
SpongeBob says: "So, we have to go in after hours when nobody's there."
Plankton says: "When nobody's there?"
The scene is skipped to where they start practicing. SpongeBob is playing Plankton's guitar, Patrick is doing his drums, and Plankton, not very excited, plays only one note on his mini-keyboard. The scene cuts to outside in front of Squidward and SpongeBob's houses, then the scene cuts to Squidward exercising. He makes one more and he has huge muscles.
Squidward says: "My perfect dream-body."
Narrator says: "One week later..."
Cut to the street where the four are heading towards the Krusty Krab at nighttime. They're all wearing their Rock-N-Roll outfits. From a distance, a tire screeching sound is heard, and the noise is later revealed to be from a police car.
Plankton says: "Oh, no, it's the cops."
Plankton says: "I can't let them see me!"
SpongeBob says: "Why?"
Plankton says: "Why?"
Plankton says: "Uh, cops are autograph hounds."
Plankton says: "Yeah, they're always after me."
SpongeBob says: "Mm, that's tough."
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, I'll hide you."
Officer John says: "Hey, what are you kids up to this late at night?"
SpongeBob says: "We're on our way to our first gig."
SpongeBob says: "We're in a band."
Officer John says: "A band, huh, well, that's, uh..."
Officer John says: "Oh."
Officer John says: "Uh, you've got a, uh..."
SpongeBob says: "Got a, uh, what?"
Officer John says: "Uh..."
Officer John says: "It's right..."
SpongeBob says: "Yes?"
SpongeBob says: "Sure thing, officer."
SpongeBob says: "They're gone."
Plankton says: "You will never speak of this to anyone."
Plankton says: "Come on, come on, hurry up."
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, I just need to get the key out."
Plankton says: "Give me that, you incompetent fool."
Plankton says: "Now where does Krabs keep that formula?"
SpongeBob says: "Whoo, let's rock!"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
Squidward says: "We're gonna be stars!"
The three enter the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob hooks up the speaker set. Plankton is nowhere to be seen.
SpongeBob says: "All right!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, are you ready?"
Squidward says: "I'm ready!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, are you ready?"
Plankton says: "Uh..."
Plankton says: "I'm ready?"
SpongeBob says: "Wait a minute..."
SpongeBob says: "Was this band just a front so you could steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula?"
Plankton says: "What?"
Plankton says: "No, I was in it for the music, man!"
The camera changes to outside the Krusty Krab and twelve police cars circle around the Krusty Krab. The scene cuts back to the Bikini Bottom Jail. Plankton, in a caged box, sighs.
Plankton says: "Well, at least I'm back to my old cell."
Police Officer says: "Oh, no, you're not."
Police Officer says: "We've got a special cell for you."
Plankton says: "But I liked my old cell."
Police Officer says: "Then you're gonna love this one."
SpongeBob says: "We've only got 22 years to practice before our next gig."
SpongeBob says: "A one and a two..."
Plankton screams in agony.
