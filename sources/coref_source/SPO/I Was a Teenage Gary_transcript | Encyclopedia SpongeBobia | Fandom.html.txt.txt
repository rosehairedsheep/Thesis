Patrick says: "Are you ready?"
SpongeBob says: "For what?"
Patrick says: "The annual jellyfish convention in Ukulele Bottom this weekend!"
Patrick says: "So, you ready or what?"
SpongeBob says: "That was this weekend?"
SpongeBob says: "I can't go; I don't have anyone to take care of Gary!"
There's a knock on the door. Squidward is seen outside. The door opens, but the first thing Squidward sees is Gary on SpongeBob's head. He looks down at SpongeBob and reveals a pair of underwear.
Squidward says: "Would you please stop leaving your undergarments on my front lawn?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, could you watch Gary this weekend?"
Squidward says: "What's a Gary?"
SpongeBob says: "Not a Gary."
SpongeBob says: "Gary."
SpongeBob says: "He's my pet snail."
Squidward says: "Yuck."
Squidward says: "You actually care for that thing?"
SpongeBob says: "I love Gary!"
Squidward says: "Well, I don't."
Squidward says: "Get somebody else."
SpongeBob says: "I guess we can't go away this weekend after all, Patrick."
Squidward says: "Go away?"
Squidward says: "You mean, if I watch Gary, you guys will be gone all weekend?"
SpongeBob says: "Actually, a three day weekend."
Squidward says: "As in, not here for three days?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, but you've already said you can't do it, we understand."
Patrick says: "Don't feel bad, Squidward."
Patrick says: "The three of us can still have our own jellyfish convention at your house!"
Squidward says: "I changed my mind."
Squidward says: "You guys deserve a weekend away."
SpongeBob says: "You'll do it?"
SpongeBob says: "Great!"
SpongeBob says: "Let me show you a little bit about snail care."
SpongeBob says: "You need to take Gary for a walk."
Squidward says: "Friday, Saturday and Sunday - a three-day weekend."
SpongeBob says: "Let me show you how to feed him."
SpongeBob says: "I have all the cans marked, a can in the morning and a can at night."
Squidward says: "Sure it's enough?"

SpongeBob says: "Now, you won't forget my instructions, will you?"
Squidward says: "I have the memory of an elephant, I'll take good care of Fred."
SpongeBob says: "Gary."
Squidward says: "Right, yeah, right."
Gary says: "Meow."
Squidward says: ": Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat!"

Incidental 116 says: "Yes, yes, it's just as I thought."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Incidental 116 says: "This is definitely a snail."
SpongeBob says: "I knew it!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Squid, did you hear that?"
Incidental 116 says: "Therefore, a shot of snail plasma must be carefully administered."
Incidental 116 says: "Here you go."
SpongeBob says: "Aren't you going to do it?"
Incidental 116 says: "Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Incidental 116 says: "I'm too squeamish."
Squidward says: "Uhh, hey, doc, let me help you with your bag there."
SpongeBob says: "Squid, wait!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't give Gary his plasma."
SpongeBob says: "I'm squeamish too."
Squidward says: "Aww, SpongeBob, I don't want to do..."
SpongeBob says: "Gary!"
Squidward says: "Okay, okay, I'll do it."
SpongeBob says: "Now, don't hurt him, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, okay, steady."
Squidward says: "Will you hold him still?"
SpongeBob says: "Ouch!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, Squidward, you just injected me with snail plasma."
Squidward says: "Well, you made me do it!"
SpongeBob says: "What's going to happen to me?"
Squidward says: "Oh, nothing, it's just a little snail plasma."
SpongeBob says: "I don't know, I feel kind of funny!"
Squidward says: "I'm telling you, it's all in your head."
Squidward says: "He just needed water?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Gary, you're better!"
Squidward says: "Oh, how touching."
Squidward says: "I'm going to go home and throw up."
Squidward says: "Good night."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, wait, the snail plasma!"
Squidward says: "Trust me, SpongeBob, nothing's going to happen to you."
Squidward says: "You're fine."
