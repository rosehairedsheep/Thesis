Note says: "Line in red is cut in UK."
The episode starts in the Chum Bucket where Karen drops chum from a paper bag.
Karen says: "Another bag of chum..."
Plankton says: "Almost done."
Karen says: "Here you go."
Karen says: "Eat up."
Plankton says: "What's this supposed to be?"
Karen says: "Chum seaweed, chum pot pie, chum con coral, and chum tea."
Karen says: "Also known as dinner."
Plankton says: "Karen, your memory banks are gumped up again."
Plankton says: "I did not request chum pot pie."
Plankton says: "I requested chum stir fry."
Karen says: "Well, I told you months ago that my memory is full but you've been too busy with your latest project."
Karen says: "So tell me, Plankton, how do you plan on failing to steal the Krabby Patty formula this time?"
Plankton says: "Computer wife, don't start with me!"
Plankton says: "This plan is foolproof I tell you, foolproof!"
A robot screen turns around and points towards Plankton.
Plankton says: "Karen, I want you to meet my new computer wife!"
Screen lights up and then straightens out to a red line matching the original Karen's.
Plankton says: "Karen 2!"
Karen says: "Karen 2?!"
Karen says: "!"
Karen says: "I've been..."
Karen says: "replaced?!"
Karen says: "!"
Plankton says: "I'm afraid so."
Plankton says: "But can you blame me?"
Plankton says: "She's got triple the processing, all the latest software, and a sleek space-age design."
Plankton says: "The whole package!"
Karen says: "I can't believe this!"
Karen says: "And after all I've done for you!"
Karen says: "You dumped me for this cheap pile of plastic?!"
Karen says: "!"
Plankton says: "Well, I had to cut cost somewhere."
Karen 2.0 says: "Who are you calling cheap?!"
Karen 2.0 says: "!"
Karen 2.0 says: "At least I don't rust!"
Karen says: "You know, you're going to wish that you'd deleted that comment!"
Plankton says: "Hey, come on, babe."
Plankton says: "Don't take it so hard."
Plankton says: "You'll find love again."
Plankton says: "Maybe you'll meet a nice..."
Plankton says: "uh..."
Plankton says: "adding machine."
Karen says: "Oh that does it!"
Plankton says: "Oh, why did I program her with a jealousy scheduler."
When the scheduler becomes fully loaded, a laser ejects from Karen's head.
Plankton says: "And why did I outfit her with a molecular re-arranger ray?"
Karen's screen then shows a picture of a pie and then a stir fry. She aims the laser at Plankton.
Karen says: "Here's your stir fry, little man!"
She blasts the ray at Plankton, but he evades it.
Plankton says: "Uh, uh."
Plankton says: "Let's not do something we might regret!"
Karen says: "You should know regret's the one thing you left out of my operating system!"
Plankton says: "Huh, what happened?"
Karen 2.0 says: "I accessed the Chum Bucket's power grid, remotely cutting off Karen's power at the source."
Plankton says: "Ha!"
Plankton says: "Karen 2, I knew you were special the moment I laid eye on your motherboard!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ah, the end of another lucrative work day, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Quitting time is almost too much to bear."
Mr. Krabs says: "Seriously, son, you gotta lighten up."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, good night, kiddo."
SpongeBob says: "Good night, sir."
SpongeBob says: "See ya tomorrow."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes, sir, sure as the sea's wet."
SpongeBob says: "Catcha later, so long."
Mr. Krabs says: "Phew, would be the first I've been saved by a pile of trash."
SpongeBob gets himself out of the box and looks at it.
SpongeBob says: "This isn't a pile of trash."
SpongeBob says: "It's a free computer system."
Mr. Krabs says: "Free!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now what kind of barnacle would throw out a perfectly good computer?"
SpongeBob says: "Judging from our location, I'd say Plankton."
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh."
Mr. Krabs says: "He always has been a knucklehead."
SpongeBob says: "Could this be one of Plankton's elaborate ruses?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Perhaps."
Mr. Krabs says: "But who could pass up a free computer?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Let's plug her in, see what she can do."
The scene bubbles over to Mr. Krabs' office. Mr, Krabs turns on Karen's monitor. Then Karen's screen shows Loading.
Mr. Krabs says: "She's loading up."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now let's see how this dial up thingy works."
Mr. Krabs says: "This thing does text mails right?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, I think so."
Karen's screen shows the words Karen Classic with her picture on it.
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, that sounds promising."
Karen starts crying on her screen and scaring Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs says: "Are computers supposed to emote?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No need to cry, little lady."
Karen says: "Don't tell me not to cry!"
Mr. Krabs says: "She's malfunctioning!"
SpongeBob says: "Must be the dial-up thingy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're right, must be interfering with her circuitry!"
Karen says: "Oh it's not the dial-up thingy."
Karen says: "It's Plankton, he dumped me for a newer piece of hardware."
Mr. Krabs says: "Help me out here, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, there."
SpongeBob says: "Dry those computer tears."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sure you two will get back together."
SpongeBob says: "Plankton just need some time to realize how much he needs you."
SpongeBob says: "I mean, you guys were made for each other."
SpongeBob says: "Well, you were made more for him and more specifically by him, and now, he's built someone with more modern features who's better in every way."
SpongeBob says: "There's no- what was my point again?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Where ya goinâ€™?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Smooth, SpongeBob, real smooth."
Mr. Krabs says: "Let's talk this out."
SpongeBob says: "Careful, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "This still could be a ruse."
SpongeBob says: "Karen's loyalty maybe still be with Plankton."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, what part of "free computer" are you not understanding?"
Cuts back to the scene where Karen is looking at the Chum Bucket through the Krusty Krab windows. Plankton's laughter is heard. The scene then shows one of the Chum Bucket door entrance window and we can see silhouettes of Plankton and Karen 2.0 having a romantic dinner with each other.
Plankton says: "Tonight, we celebrate, and tomorrow, the secret formula."
Karen says: "I don't ever want to see that low life again as long as I live."
Karen says: "Goodbye, you miserable little bug!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, in the case, welcome aboard!"
SpongeBob says: "All right!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeehaw!"
Bubble transitions to morning where we see Squidward going inside the Krusty Krab.
Squidward says: "Huh?"
Karen says: "Welcome to the Krusty Krab."
Karen says: "May I take your order?"
Squidward says: "My order?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I see Squidward must not have gotten the last company text mail."
Mr. Krabs says: "Karen will be taking over your duties from now on, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "She's efficient and more importantly: I don't have to pay her."
Squidward says: "So, I'm fired?"
Squidward says: "No more taking orders?"
Squidward says: "Whoo."
Mr. Krabs says: "Not so fast, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward."
Bubble transitions over to Squidward in the bathroom holding a mop. It turns out that Mr. Krabs had given him bathroom duty. Squidward sighs in disappointment. The scene then cuts to three fish in line waiting to take their order.
Ivy says: "Hi there, can I get a Krabby Patty and a side of coral bits please?"
Karen says: "You'll get your Krabby Patty when I'm good and ready!"
Karen says: "..."
Karen says: "going through a lot emotionally, right now."
SpongeBob says: "Well, you know what cheers me up when I'm feeling down?"
Karen says: "You defragment your hard drive?"
SpongeBob says: "No, putting in a hard days work at the greatest job in the world: The Krusty Krab."
He hears thumping. The customers look to the door to see Karen 2.0 trying to get in the Krusty Krab, but she couldn't open the doors due to her not having any arms. Plankton peeks out of a secret compartment in Karen 2.0.
Plankton says: "Hey, what's the hold up, Karen 2?"
Plankton says: "That secret formula's not going to steal itself, you know."
Karen 2.0 says: "I'm trying to open the door."
Karen 2.0 says: "You didn't exactly design me with arms, you know."
Plankton says: "Yes, I suppose that's true."
Plankton says: "All right, I got this."
Plankton says: "What's she doing here?"
Plankton says: "Karen, working at the Krusty Krab?"
Plankton says: "What the?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Karen 2.0 gets pushed into the Krusty Krab by some fish wanting to come in. Karen 2.0 gets pushed in front of Karen.
Karen says: "Well, if it isn't Little Miss Home-Wrecker."
Karen 2.0 says: "And if it isn't the washed up analog has-been."
Plankton pops out of his compartment in Karen 2.0 to listen in on the two Karens' argument.
Karen says: "Analog?"
Karen says: "Who you calling analog?!"
Karen says: "!"
Plankton quickly goes back inside the compartment sensing a fight is about to begin.
Karen 2.0 says: "I see you've taken your proper role as a "Cash Machine."
Karen says: "At least I don't look like I was designed to be a glorified vacuum cleaner!"
Karen 2.0 says: "Well, at least I can say I was designed."
Karen says: "Why I oughta..."
Karen says: "!"
Karen 2.0 says: "You rusty bucket of bolts."
Karen says: "You glorified toaster oven!"
Karen 2.0 says: "You poor excuse for a house wife."
The fish gasp and start talking.
Nazz-Mini says: "Hey, what's going on?"
Dave says: "I don't know, but my money's on the one with the chrome back side."
Mr. Krabs says: "Seriously?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Did you just say money?"
Microphone lowers down and Mr. Krabs grabs it.
Mr. Krabs says: "Welcome to the fight of the century!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Where for only $5."
Mr. Krabs says: "99, and the purchase of two Krabby Patties, you will plead the answer to the age-old question."
Mr. Krabs says: "Which is superior?"
Mr. Krabs says: "High-speed integrated circuits?"
Karen 2.0 says: "Prepare to have your motherboard rattled."
Mr. Krabs says: "..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Or old-school vacuum tubes and diodes?"
Karen says: "You're about to have your cookies crumbled!"
Karen 2.0 says: "Bring it."
Karen and Karen 2.0 start fighting.
Plankton says: "Wait!"
Plankton says: "This isn't getting me any closer to the formula."
Karen grabs Karen 2.0 by the neck.
Karen 2.0 kicks Karen.
Karen uppercuts Karen 2.0 and she flies backwards.
Karen 2.0 headbutts Karen.
Karen 2.0 says: "That will defrag your algorithms."
Plankton says: "Ow!"
Karen 2.0 says: "Plankton?"
Karen 2.0 moves back from a squished Plankton.
Plankton groans in pain and audience gasps.
Karen says: "Stop!"
Karen says: "He's hurt!"
Karen 2.0 says: "You're throwing in the towel?"
Karen says: "You heartless homepage-wrecking hussy!"
Karen's arms start spinning around rapidly and she moves towards Karen 2.0.
Karen 2.0's screen is broken off by Karen's arms and Karen 2.0 falls to the ground and breaks.
Audience cheers.
Karen says: "No one runs down my man."
Karen says: "Planky, say something..."
Plankton says: "Take me home, baby..."
Karen says: "Even though you are a tiny green loser, I could never stay..."
Karen falls to the ground, Plankton screams and dodges.
Plankton says: "Karen!"
Plankton says: "Don't you leave me, Karen."
Plankton says: "Not again!"
Plankton opens up Karen 2.0's compartment, takes her battery out and places it in Karen's compartment.
Plankton says: "I hope this works..."
Plankton says: "Oh, Karen, please wake up!"
Plankton says: "I promise never to take you for granted again!"
Karen's screen shows a spinning hourglass.
Karen says: "What happened?"
Plankton says: "I had a reality check, that's what happened."
Audience claps and Karen stands up.
Plankton says: "Come on."
Plankton says: "Let's go home to the Chum Bucket, honey."
Karen says: "I had the strangest dream."
Karen says: "I dreamt there were two of me!"
Plankton says: "Two of you?"
Plankton says: "Heh, well that is strange."
Karen 2.0's screen explodes. Karen and the customers leave the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, great."
Mr. Krabs says: "There goes me revenue."
Mr. Krabs says: "What am I gonna do now?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, we could rebuild Karen 2."
Squidward is wearing Karen 2.0's screen as a mask.
Squidward says: "Welcome to the Krusty Krab."
Squidward says: "May I take your order, beep, beep?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Keep it up, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "The kids love robots."
Squidward says: "What I wouldn't do to have my face in a toilet right now."
