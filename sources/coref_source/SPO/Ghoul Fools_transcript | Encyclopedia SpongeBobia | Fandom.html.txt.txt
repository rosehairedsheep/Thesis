SpongeBob and Patrick are lying on the grass.
SpongeBob says: "Aah."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, don't you love staring at clouds and thinking about what they look like?"
Patrick says: "Yeah, it really calms my inner demons."
SpongeBob says: "It looks just like Sandy."
Patrick says: "I'm not seeing it."
Patrick says: "Ooh, check out that cloud!"
Patrick says: "It looks just like a..."
Patrick says: "um, um, um, d'oh, it's coming, uh, looks like a..."

SpongeBob says: "Um, Patrick, I think that really is a flying houseboat."
SpongeBob and Patrick watch houseboat fly away, then lose gas and fall near the grass.
SpongeBob says: "What is it, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "It's probably just one of those fake haunted houses, you know, for babies."
SpongeBob says: "I don't know, Patrick, it's very scary-looking and spooky."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, wait for me!"
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob, can you give me a boost?"
Patrick gets up on top of SpongeBob.
Patrick says: "A little to the left."
Patrick says: "Hurry up, lazy-bones!"
SpongeBob gets up to the boat.
Patrick says: "Wow."
Patrick says: "Look at this place!"
Patrick says: "It's so cheesy!"
Patrick says: "Check out this lame doorknob."
SpongeBob looks at skeleton doorknob, which shrieks at him. SpongeBob laughs nervously.
Patrick says: "Let's check out inside."
SpongeBob says: "I don't know, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Oh, come on, don't be such a baby!"
Patrick says: "Wow, so lame!"
Thunder clap is heard.
SpongeBob notices the eyeballs blink, to which he runs away.
Patrick says: "Huh."
Patrick says: "So not scary!"
Patrick says: "Did you say something, SpongeBob?"
Snakes go back into picture.
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob, check this out!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, I'll be right there!"
Patrick says: "Even the spiders are fake!"
Patrick says: "I wish something would..."
Patrick says: "pop out of a closet!"
Patrick says: "Like a big, hairy hand!"
Patrick says: "Would be cool, though, wouldn't it?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, where is that music coming from?"
Patrick says: "I think it's coming from that guy!"
Shows ghost playing the organ, while a thunder clap is heard.
Patrick says: "We do!"
Lord Poltergeist says: "Aye."
Lord Poltergeist says: "And what manner of beastie might you two be?"
Patrick says: "Obviously a puppet or a robot!"
Patrick says: "Oh, we must be in one of those fancy pizza parlors, with those singing animated robots!"
Lord Poltergeist says: "Robots?"
Lord Poltergeist says: "Puppets?"
Lord Poltergeist says: "Pizza parlors?!"

Patrick says: "You're coin-operated, aren't you?"
Lord Poltergeist says: "So you want me to sing ye a shanty, eh?"
Patrick says: "Uh-huh!"
Patrick says: "Uh-huh!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't put yourself out for us!"
Lord Poltergeist says: "And you do not think I'm a real ghost, do ye?"
Patrick says: "Nope!"
SpongeBob says: "I do, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "dead pirate, sir!"
Lord Poltergeist says: "Oh, oh, oh, I'll sing ye a song, all right!"

Lord Poltergeist says: "Hit it, fingers!"
Ghosts says: "Yo-ho-ho, yo-hoooooooooooo!"
Patrick says: "They're good!"
Ghosts says: "♪Oh, we're the ghouls of the briny deep!"
Ghosts says: "Under the waves we like to creep."
Ghosts says: "Creeping in coffins with spider webs as ghostly pillows beneath our heads."
Ghosts says: "Oh, we're the ghouls of the briny deep."
Ghosts says: "Under the waves we like to creep."

Patrick says: "Take my best friend instead!"
Patrick says: "He's lived a full life!"
Patrick cowers in fear as SpongeBob is surprised by his act.
Lord Poltergeist says: "Eh, great friend you have here!"
SpongeBob says: "Why have you come to Bikini Bottom, oh mighty dead pirate type person, sir?"
Lord Poltergeist says: "Eh, that's funny you should ask."
Lord Poltergeist says: "Usually, when I come to town, it's to terrify the populous and enslave their souls in eternal torment!"
Lord Poltergeist says: "Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Lord Poltergeist says: "Eh, but this time we just blew a head gasket."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I didn't know you ghosts had gaskets in your heads!"
Lord Poltergeist says: "Not us, you imbecile!"
Lord Poltergeist says: "Our engine room broke down."
Lord Poltergeist says: "Hey, Charlie, you got that busted head gasket out yet?"
Charlie says: "Here you go, boss!"
Lord Poltergeist says: "Say, maybe you two morons..."
Lord Poltergeist says: "Um, fine gentlemen, could pick up a new one for us!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, uh, us?"
Lord Poltergeist says: "Yes, you!"
Lord Poltergeist says: "And just as a little incentive to make you return , I'll take your souls as deposit!"
Poltergeist grabs SpongeBob and Patrick and puts their souls into glass bottles. Poltergeist poofs up a treasure chest and picks a doubloon from it, giving to SpongeBob.
Lord Poltergeist says: "Here's a shiny doubloon to buy a new gasket."
Lord Poltergeist says: "Succeed and maybe you'll get another doubloon!"
Lord Poltergeist says: "If you aren't back in 24 hours, your souls are mine and you'll be part of my ghastly crew, um, , let's see here, three weeks from Thursday..."
Lord Poltergeist says: "forever!"
SpongeBob says: "Um, can we run screaming in horror from your ship now, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "ghost pirate, sir?"
Lord Poltergeist says: "Oh, why certainly!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, after you!"
SpongeBob and Patrick leave, screaming in horror.
Lord Poltergeist says: "Such a polite lad!"

Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, what in the bulging blue barnacles, are you up to?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, it was awful!"
SpongeBob says: "We just had a spooky encounter of the ghostly kind!"

SpongeBob says: "We were just minding our own business and a haunted houseboat fell out of the sky!"
Patrick says: "And it was full of ghosts!"
Patrick says: "The really, real kind, not fake kind!"
Mr. Krabs puts Patrick's tongue back in place, knocking him down.
SpongeBob says: "The captain of the ghost gave us this doubloon and told us to buy him a new head gasket!"
SpongeBob says: "And then, he took our souls and he put them in bottles and he said he's going to turn us into ghosts if we don't get that head gasket!"
SpongeBob says: "You gotta help us, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "I feel so empty without my soul!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Did you say doubloon?"
Frank says: "Hey!"
Mr. Krabs comes back with head gasket.
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, let's go see those ghost fellers!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We'll catch 'em and take their gold!"
SpongeBob says: "But Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "We don't know the first thing about ghost hunting!"

Sandy says: "Sure, I was looking for milkshake gremlins!"
Sandy scans milkshake for gremlins.
Sandy says: "Nope, none in there!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Great, then it's settled, let's go catch us some ghost gold!"
Squidward says: "What makes you think I have any interest in your delusional adventurism?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Come on, Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Think about what all those doubloons could do for the Krusty Krab, eh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why, I could buy you that break room you're always whining about!"
Squidward imagines, sitting near a microwave, waiting for his burrito to be done.
Squidward says: "Okay, I'm in!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Super!"
Mr. Krabs says: "More hands means more gold."
Mr. Krabs says: "So what do ya say SpongeBob?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Are ya ready!"
SpongeBob says: "I'll go, but just to get my soul back."
Mr. Krabs says: "Who needs a soul when you're filthy rich?"

SpongeBob says: "Look, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "The doubloons!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I wouldn't touch that if I were you!"
SpongeBob says: "That gold probably has ghost germs all over it."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, don't be silly, SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "There's no such things as germs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, Patrick, think fast!"
Patrick says: "Think?"

Lord Poltergeist says: "Those weren't your souls."
Lord Poltergeist says: "Those were just a couple of old orange sodas that have been sitting in the sun too long!"
Patrick says: "I thought mine seemed a little flat."
SpongeBob says: "But what about our real souls?"
Lord Poltergeist says: "Eh, I never had 'em."
Lord Poltergeist says: "Everyone knows you can't hold onto a wild soul."
