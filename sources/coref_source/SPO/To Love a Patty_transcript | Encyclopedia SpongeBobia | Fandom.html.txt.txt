SpongeBob says: "five and six."
Squidward says: "Uh—"
Squidward says: "yeah."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Patty, a patty like you comes around once in a lifetime."
SpongeBob says: "I can't let them eat you."
SpongeBob says: "No, the job must come first."

Mr. Krabs says: "What was that?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I couldn't hear you."
SpongeBob says: "How about now?"
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, take a seat."
SpongeBob says: "Grrrrrazie!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, good evening, monsieur."
SpongeBob says: "What might we have on the menu at this fine establishment?"
Squidward says: "Well, you should know considering the fact you work here, sod for brains."
Squidward says: "Speaking of sods—"
Squidward says: "why don't you get rid of this garbage?"
Squidward says: "It's starting to stink up the joint."
SpongeBob says: "Don't say such a thing, Squidward."

SpongeBob says: "But to me, she's the most gorgeous creature in the sea."
Squidward says: "Well, I definitely see I can't help the mentally atrophied."
Squidward says: "Goodbye, Creature."
SpongeBob says: "Patty, you no mind to that, wubbie-wubbie."
SpongeBob says: "I will always love you—"
SpongeBob says: "What happened to you?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I think I can explain, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "There was a time when I was in love too."
Mr. Krabs says: "She was a Krabby Patty that looked a lot like yours does."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, maybe not right now, but you know what I mean."
Mr. Krabs says: "She was a firm, juicy, a warm patty."
Mr. Krabs says: "And attractive- oh, she looked good enough to eat."
Mr. Krabs says: "So—"
Mr. Krabs says: "I did."
Mr. Krabs says: "do you hear what I'm saying to you, boy?"
SpongeBob says: "Um, not quite, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabby Patties are meant to be loved and eaten."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's what they're put in the ocean for."
Mr. Krabs says: "And it looks like yours is way past due."
SpongeBob says: "I see now."
SpongeBob says: "I see what I must do."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well done, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "As a reward for your valiant effort, I'll only charge you 25¢ for the patty."
Mr. Krabs says: "Employee discount."
SpongeBob says: "Can I get a doggie bag with that?"
