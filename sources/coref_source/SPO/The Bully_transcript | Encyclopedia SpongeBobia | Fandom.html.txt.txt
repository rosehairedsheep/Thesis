At Mrs. Puff's Boating School, SpongeBob is arranging his pencils on his desk.
SpongeBob says: "Excuse me, miss?"
Nancy says: "I don't want to have to report you again."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "is it the homework pencil on the left side of the paper next to the quiz pencil, or over on the right side all by itself?"
SpongeBob says: "Or..."
Nancy says: "I think it goes stuck inside your..."
SpongeBob says: "Wait, I got it!"
SpongeBob says: "The quiz pencil goes right over here next to the essay pencil  just in case I have to write an essay."
Mrs. Puff says: "Tell the class something about yourself, Flats."
Flats says: "Well, I like to kick people's butts."
Mrs. Puff says: "Okay class, as you remember last week..."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, I'm SpongeBob!"
Flats says: "Hi, SpongeBob."
Flats says: "I'm gonna kick your butt."
SpongeBob says: "That joke was almost funnier the second time."
Flats says: "No."
Flats says: "I mean it."
SpongeBob says: "Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Yes, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Can I be excused for the rest of my life?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Why no, SpongeBob."
Mrs. Puff says: "I'm in the middle of a coffee-fueled sermon right now."
Mrs. Puff says: "You can't afford to miss this information."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff."
Mrs. Puff says: "Now, can I please have a volunteer to come up to the board?"
Mrs. Puff says: "How about you, Flats?"
SpongeBob says: "I just don't understand."
SpongeBob says: "Why would Flats want to kick my butt?"
SpongeBob says: "I haven't said two words to the guy!"
Martin says: "Oh that's real nice."
SpongeBob says: "Phew, I thought for sure that was gonna be..."
Flats says: "Hey, that story really speaks to me."
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
SpongeBob says: "What's it say?"
Flats says: "It says now, I'm gonna kick your butt twice as hard."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "and I leave Gary's water bowl to Gary, and my curtains to..."
SpongeBob says: "oh Neptune, I just can't do this."
SpongeBob says: "Death row, next in line speaking."
Patrick says: "Hi, I'd like to place an order for delivery."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Is that you?"
Patrick says: "Yeah, hey, Mario."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, listen!"
SpongeBob says: "It's me, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "I need your help!"
Patrick says: "You're working at Pizza Castle now?"
SpongeBob says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "No, listen!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm in big trouble."
SpongeBob says: "There's a new guy at school here and he wants to kick my butt!"
SpongeBob says: "Listen, you're big and strong, do you think you could come down here and maybe rough him a bit?"
SpongeBob says: "Just to get him off my back?"
SpongeBob says: "Please, Patrick, I'm so scared, it feels like I'm gonna throw up."
Patrick says: "No, they're not closed."
Patrick says: "I know, you want olives."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you there?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Come in, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff, can I be in a different class?"
Mrs. Puff says: "But why?"
SpongeBob says: "I can't tell you."
Mrs. Puff says: "Why ever not?"
SpongeBob says: "I just can't, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff."
SpongeBob says: "My physical being is at stake, let's just leave it at that."
Mrs. Puff says: "SpongeBob, you can tell me anything."
Mrs. Puff says: "You've got to believe that."
SpongeBob says: "Well, okay."
SpongeBob says: "But only if you promise to keep it between us."
Mrs. Puff says: "Of course."
SpongeBob says: "Flats says he's going to kick my butt!"
Mrs. Puff says: "What?!"
Mrs. Puff says: "!"
Mrs. Puff says: "There shall be no butt-kicking in any class of mine!"
Mrs. Puff says: "This is an adult program, SpongeBob."
Mrs. Puff says: "Just leave it to me."
SpongeBob says: "Aw, thanks, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff."
SpongeBob says: "I knew I could count on you."
Mrs. Puff says: "Have a nice lunch, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff."
Mrs. Puff says: "SpongeBob, I talked to Flats for you."
Mrs. Puff says: "I used your name."
Mrs. Puff says: "It was all a misunderstanding."
SpongeBob says: "You what?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Mrs. Puff says: "He was never going to kick your butt at all!"
Mrs. Puff says: "You see SpongeBob, Flats is from a town where kicking someone's butt means that he wants to be your friend."
Mrs. Puff says: "And maybe play some sports with you on weekends."
SpongeBob says: "I've got diarrhea!"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Are you Flats' dad?"
Flats' Dad says: "Why, yes I am."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, see, I didn't know where else to turn!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick couldn't help me, and Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff only made it worse."
SpongeBob says: "I sit next to your son Flats in school, and he is a fine boy and all, and I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but he wants to kick my butt."
Flats says: "Dad, what are you doing?"
Flats' Dad says: "Uhh, nothing son."
Flats says: "What did I tell you about talking to strangers?"
Flats' Dad says: "Now he's gonna kick my butt!"
Lonnie says: "Hi there, young people."
Lonnie says: "Nice day today."
Harold says: "So, you like kicking butts, do ya?"
Harold says: "Well, we'll show you, old man!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, okay, I got to skip town, start a new life, live under an assumed name!"
SpongeBob says: ""BobPants SpongeSquare"."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, that's good."
SpongeBob says: "Grow a beard, and then shave it off, and live happily ever after."
Flats says: "Yeah, except you forgot the part where I kick your butt!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Flats, you feeling better?"
Flats says: "What?"
Flats says: "Where am I?"
Dr. Gill Gilliam says: "Why, you're in the hospital."
Dr. Gill Gilliam says: "This young boy saved your life."
Dr. Gill Gilliam says: "He performed CPR for five hours straight."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
SpongeBob says: "They said you'd be okay after the first few minutes, but I just wanted to be sure."
Flats says: "Wow, I'm touched."
Flats says: "I'll have to remember that when I'm kicking your butt."
Flats says: "Those flowers for me?"
Harold says: "How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man!"
Harold says: "?"
Lonnie says: "I love the young people!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh Gary, I'm too young to have my butt kicked!"
SpongeBob says: "There are so many things in life I haven't gotten to do!"
SpongeBob says: "Flats!"
Flats says: "It's butt-kicking time!"
SpongeBob says: "Gary, there's something I want you to know, but I'm too scared to remember what it is."
Flats says: "Let's do it!"
SpongeBob says: "Go away, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "I don't want you to see this."
SpongeBob says: "It'll be ugly."
Flats says: "Are you ready?"
SpongeBob says: "Hold on."
SpongeBob says: "You have any sevens?"
Gary says: "Meow."
Mrs. Puff says: "Sorry I'm late, class, I..."
Mrs. Puff says: "I'm going to kick your butt!"
