Narrator says: "Welcome to Bikini Bottom, where can be found some of the finest specimens of undersea life."
Patrick says: "An award?"
Patrick says: "I never got an award before!"
Patrick says: "Eeeee!"
Patrick says: "Look rock, I got an award."
Patrick says: "I gotta show SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Hold still, Gary."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Almost done."
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob, guess what?"
Patrick says: "I got an award."
SpongeBob says: "That's great, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "What's it for?"
Patrick says: "See for yourself."
SpongeBob says: ""For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement: SpongeBob SquarePants"?"
Patrick says: ""SpongeBob SquarePants"?"
Patrick says: "That's a funny way to spell my name."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I think the award is for me."
SpongeBob says: "You must've got it by mistake."
Patrick says: "But, it's shiny."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?"
Patrick says: "Ice cream!"
SpongeBob says: "Exactly!"
Patrick says: "I can find it."
Patrick says: "Is it in here?"
SpongeBob says: "No, don't!"
SpongeBob says: "That's my..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "award closet."
Patrick says: "I want an award!"
SpongeBob says: "You'll get an award one day."
Patrick says: "I'm never gonna get an award 'cause I've never done anything."
SpongeBob says: "But you're Patrick..."
SpongeBob says: "Star."
SpongeBob says: "You can do anything you want."
Patrick says: "That's easy for you to say."
Patrick says: "You're SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something."
Patrick says: "Hmmm..."
Patrick says: "I wanna defeat the giant monkeyman and save the 9th dimension!"
SpongeBob says: "Me too!"
SpongeBob says: "But that sounds a little hard."
SpongeBob says: "Why don't we start smaller?"
Patrick says: "I wanna defeat the little monkeyman and save the 8th dimension!"
SpongeBob says: "Smaller."
Patrick says: "Doctor?"
SpongeBob says: "Smaller."
Patrick says: "Fireman?"
Patrick says: "A job at the Krusty Krab?"
SpongeBob says: "I do things at work all the time."
Patrick says: "Then let's go."
Patrick says: "Boy, it sure was nice of Mr."
Patrick says: "Krabs to give me a job."
SpongeBob says: "And at 50 dollars an hour, too."
SpongeBob says: "When I started working here, I had to pay Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs 100 dollars an hour."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?"
Squidward says: "Guess who just quit?"
Patrick says: "Do I get my award yet?"
SpongeBob says: "You have to work for it, remember?"
Patrick says: "Tartar sauce."
Patrick says: "Do I get my award now?"
SpongeBob says: "No, you have to take the tray to the customer."
Patrick says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "Almost."
SpongeBob says: "Try again and this time make sure the food gets to the table."
Patrick says: "Like that?"
SpongeBob says: "Nope."
Patrick says: "Barnacles!"
SpongeBob says: "Let's try something different."
SpongeBob says: "All you have to do is answer the phone."
Patrick says: "Aye aye, Captain!"
Guy on Phone says: "Is this the Krusty Krab?"
Patrick says: "No, this is Patrick."
Woman on Phone says: "Is this the Krusty Krab?"
Another Guy on Phone says: "Is this the Krusty Krab?"
Patrick says: "I'm not a Krusty Krab."
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant."
Patrick says: "Huh?"
Patrick says: "Oh..."
Patrick says: "Fishpaste!"
SpongeBob says: "It looks a little dusty around Table 3."
SpongeBob says: "How about you sweep it out?"
Patrick says: "What's the point?"
Patrick says: "I can't do anything right."
SpongeBob says: "You'll do fine."
SpongeBob says: "Keep trying, Patrick."
Delivery Guy says: "I've got a load of awards for SpongeBob SquarePants."
SpongeBob says: "Kitchen..."
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "I'm never gonna get an award, now."
SpongeBob says: "Don't give up, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "This time I've got something I know you can do."
SpongeBob says: "We're gonna open a jar."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, that's a pickle."
Patrick says: "Yes."
SpongeBob says: "You need a jar."
SpongeBob says: "Warmer."
SpongeBob says: "You're hot."
SpongeBob says: "You're on fire!"
Patrick says: "Ow, it burns!"
SpongeBob says: "Ok, ok."
SpongeBob says: "Wait, wait."
SpongeBob says: "Do exactly as I do."
SpongeBob says: "Exactly."
SpongeBob says: "Exactly."
SpongeBob says: "Exactly."
Patrick says: "Exactly as you do."
Patrick says: "Oh, no, I broke it!"
SpongeBob says: "No, no, Patrick, you did it!"
Patrick says: "I did?"
Patrick says: "Touchdown!"
Patrick says: "I'm jarmaster!"
SpongeBob says: "That was great, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "You really got the hang of it."
Patrick says: "Yeah."
Patrick says: "Remember when I had my hand up?"
Patrick says: "And I put it on the lid?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah."
Patrick says: "Then I took the lid off and I thought I broke it?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
Patrick says: "But I didn't."
Patrick says: "I opened the jar with my hand."
Patrick says: "And it was all because you showed me how to do it."
Patrick says: "I'm never gonna forget this."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you do exactly what I do and you'll have an award in no time."
Patrick says: "Good morning, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Wow."
SpongeBob says: "It's amazing how a simple change of clothes can make a guy look..."
SpongeBob says: "just..."
SpongeBob says: "like..."
SpongeBob says: "me."
Patrick says: "Yup."
Patrick says: "If I'm gonna be an award winner, I've gotta dress like one."
SpongeBob says: "That's creepy..."
SpongeBob says: "but flattering!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready..."
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, back to the ol' grind."
Patrick says: "Well, back to the ol' grind."
SpongeBob says: "Forgot my hat."
Patrick says: "Uh, me, too."
Patrick says: "Uhh, me, too."
Patrick says: "Ow!"
SpongeBob says: "Aha!"
SpongeBob says: "You're copying me!"
Patrick says: "Yes."
SpongeBob says: "Why are you doing that?"
Patrick says: "So I can win an award like you."
SpongeBob says: "Well, it's annoying, so stop it!"
Patrick says: "Stop it."
SpongeBob says: "Say, you're good."
Patrick says: "Thanks."
SpongeBob says: "Ha!"
Patrick says: "Ha!"
SpongeBob says: "Darn."
Patrick says: "Darn."
Patrick says: "At least I'm safe inside my mind."
SpongeBob says: "Stop copying me!"
Patrick says: "There's no award for that!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, how long are you gonna keep this up?"
Patrick says: "Until I have as many awards as you."
SpongeBob says: "We'll see about that!"
Patrick says: "No, we won't."
SpongeBob says: "I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom."
Patrick says: "Me, too."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah?"
SpongeBob says: "I call this one: The Slice N' Dice."
Patrick says: "Oh, no, you don't!"
SpongeBob says: "Not much fun being me, now, huh, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Are you kidding?"
Patrick says: "I used to do this way before I started copying you."
Patrick says: "My turn!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi, I'm Patrick Star."
SpongeBob says: "I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "What's so great about being a big pink loser?"
Patrick says: "Exactly."
Patrick says: "I was never closer to an award then the minute I started copying you."
SpongeBob says: "But, Patrick..."
Patrick says: "Patrick's not here!"
SpongeBob says: "Another trophy?"
Patrick says: "What's it for THIS time?"
SpongeBob says: ""For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else: Patrick"!"
SpongeBob says: "This trophy's for you!"
Patrick says: "Yay!"
SpongeBob says: "So, what are you gonna do, now?"
Patrick says: "I'm gonna go protect my title."
Narrator says: "So you thought I was kidding, huh?"
Narrator says: "No, in Bikini Bottom, excellence can be found, even under a rock."
