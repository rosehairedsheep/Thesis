It starts to snow harder. Eventually, Bikini Bottom is blanketed in show. The Realistic Fish Head appears wearing a snow hat.
Realistic Fish Head says: "Yes, it seems Old Man Winter paid us a visit late last night, and he brought with him not a pillow or a sheet,  it's nothing but the white stuff."
The scene shows a close up shot of SpongeBob's door. SpongeBob opens it and he and Gary are shown.
SpongeBob says: "Whoopee!"
Johnny Elaine says: "And local residents are taking notice!"
The scene pans through Jimmy Gus making a snow fish, a snow whale, two kids making a snow mermaid, and Mr. Krabs making a snow dollar. The scene changes to show Mrs. Puff walking to her boat. She puffs up and blows the snow off. She gets in and drives past the show that was previously on her boat. Fred pops out and shakes his "fist".
Fred says: "Hey!"
A wide shot of the Chum Bucket is shown. A close shot of the doors is shown. Plankton opens the door.
The scene changes to show Patrick. He has an idea.
Patrick says: "Snow angel!"
Patrick says: "Thanks a lot, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "While you were just standing there whistling, someone threw a snowball at me!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, really, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Yeah."
Patrick says: "This is serious, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "Someone's after me."
Patrick says: "I think I better leave town."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I threw it."
SpongeBob says: "We're having a snowball fight."
SpongeBob says: "Don't you get it?"
Patrick says: "Snowball fight?"
Patrick says: "I want to play!"
Patrick says: "I want to play!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, first, you have to make a snowball."
Patrick says: "Oh, yeah."
Patrick says: "A snowball."
Patrick says: "Aw..."
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, can you help me make a snowball?"
SpongeBob says: "Sure, pal."
Patrick says: "Thanks, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "How could you?"
Patrick says: "It's a snowball fight, remember?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah."
Squidward says: "Ah, yes."
Squidward says: "Warm fire, cozy slippers, and a piping hot cup of tea with a lemon wedge."
Squidward says: "Would you two please keep it down?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "You're just in time to enlist in my army!"
SpongeBob says: "Join me, and together we'll defeat the Pink Menace!"
Patrick says: "That's me!"
SpongeBob says: "I can start you off as a buck private, but with hard work, perhaps you can rise through the ranks and become a regular private!"
Squidward says: "Thanks, but no, thanks, Major Stupidity."
Squidward says: "You and General Nonsense over there will have to fight without me."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you fool!"
SpongeBob says: "This was over before it started!"
SpongeBob says: "I will now consider your unconditional surren-..."
Patrick says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Score one for the boys back home!"
Squidward says: "Yes?"
Squidward says: "Oh, Patrick."
Patrick says: "I was trying to tell you that I was choking on snow, but the snow melted and turned into water, and I drank all the water, now I'm better."
Squidward says: "Fascinating."
Squidward says: "What?"
Patrick says: "Can I use your bathroom?"
Squidward says: "Patrick, go use your own bathroom."
Patrick says: "I don't think I can make it!"
Patrick says: "Please?"
Squidward says: "No."
Patrick says: "Please?"
Squidward says: "No."
Patrick says: "Please?"
Squidward says: "No."
Patrick says: "Please!"
Squidward says: "Okay, make it quick."
SpongeBob says: "Aha!"
SpongeBob says: "Aiding the enemy!"
SpongeBob says: "I've caught you red-handed, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Look, SpongeBob, I was just..."
Patrick says: "Yay!"
Patrick says: "Squidward's on my side!"
Squidward says: "I most certainly am not!"
SpongeBob says: "Then that means he's on my side!"
Squidward says: "No, SpongeBob, I'm not on your side either."
Squidward says: "I'm on nobody's side."
Squidward says: "Snowball fights are for immature children and I will not stoop to your level."
Patrick says: "Come on, SpongeBob, let's go knock each other's brains out!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm ready!"
Squidward says: "Hmm..."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Patrick, it's out."
Squidward says: "knocking each other's brains out!"
SpongeBob says: "We signed a peace treaty, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "You were right, fighting is for children."
Squidward says: "No, no, no, I misled you, it's for adults too!"
Squidward says: "Give me that peace treaty!"
Squidward says: "There!"
Squidward says: "Let the war continue!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, that wasn't the peace treaty."
SpongeBob says: "That was a copy of the peace treaty."
Squidward says: "Look, you two are giving up too easily."
Squidward says: "Now, Patrick, pretend I'm SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "And who am I?"
Squidward says: "You're Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Can I be Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "Wait, why?"
SpongeBob says: "He's a good leader."
Squidward says: "Would you butt out?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Patrick says: "Hey, you can't talk to Mr."
Patrick says: "Krabs like that, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "I'm SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "You're Patrick!"
Squidward says: "Patrick, why didn't you hit SpongeBob?"
Patrick says: "You said you were SpongeBob, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Oh, boy."
Squidward says: "All right, I can see where this is going."
Squidward says: "Let's just say for all intents and purposes that I, Squidward, am now part in this war."
Squidward says: "Now..."
SpongeBob says: "If you're in this war, then where's your fort?"
Squidward says: "I don't have one, okay?"
Squidward says: "Now..."
Patrick says: "You got to have a fort, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Forts win wars, Squidward."
Squidward says: "There."
Squidward says: "There's your fort!"
Squidward says: "Now..."
Patrick says: "Your fort's too small, Squidward."
Squidward says: "It's okay, Patrick."
Squidward says: "It's just a demonstration."
Squidward says: "Now..."
SpongeBob says: "He's right, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "That thing would never protect you."
SpongeBob says: "It's downright puny."
Squidward says: "Trust me, it's fine."
SpongeBob says: "See, it is too small."
Squidward says: "Not if I crouch down."
Squidward says: "I mean, you didn't even give me a chance to crouch down."
SpongeBob says: "Exposed."
Squidward says: "Would you two please..."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward returned fire!"
Patrick says: "Then it's war!"
Squidward says: "No-no..."
Squidward says: "no, wait, wait, wait!"
Squidward says: "This was actually kind of..."
Squidward says: "exciting!"
Squidward says: "Why..."
Squidward says: "I've never felt so alive!"
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "I think Squidward's taking this really seriously."
Patrick says: "That last one had his clarinet in it."
SpongeBob says: "Hmm..."
SpongeBob says: "looks like it's time for Plan B."
Squidward says: "What's going on?"
Squidward says: "The snowballs have stopped falling."
Squidward says: "I better take advantage of this momentary cease-fire."
SpongeBob says: "Did you hear something, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Nope."
Man on TV says: "Get out the snowshoes and the shovels."
