Grandma Plankton says: "How about a little more, Plankton, or has this old granny had enough for one night?"
Plankton says: "Oh, Grandma, you know I always have more pudding for you!"
Grandma Plankton says: "Oh, that looks simply delightful!"
Plankton says: "You once told me that this was your favorite flavor growing up as a child."
Grandma Plankton says: "Ration?"
Plankton says: "Uh, no, chocolate."
Plankton says: "Open up!"
Plankton says: "There you are."
Plankton says: "There you are, darling."
Grandma Plankton says: "Oh, Plankton."
Grandma Plankton says: "You always were my favorite granddaughter!"
Nurse says: "Five minutes until bedtime, Mr."
Nurse says: "Plankton."
Plankton says: "Well, Grandma, that's the sweetest, most tender..."
Nurse says: "Five minutes, Mr."
Nurse says: "Plank..."
Plankton says: "I heard you the first time!"
Plankton says: "Now, where were we?"
Plankton says: "Grandma, don't forget your teeth."
Plankton says: "Ooh."
Plankton says: "Uh, uh, now, now, Grandma, just relax."
Plankton says: "There, there."
Plankton says: "Excuse me, Sonny, I'd simply love one of your Krabby what's-it's, but my delicate digestive system has special needs, and I'll need to see a complete list of ingredients."
Plankton says: "You wouldn't want me to be up all night with painful bloating, would you?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Goodness, no!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Here you are."
Plankton says: "Thanks, Sonny!"
Plankton says: "I'm just going to take it home; I left my bifocals there."
SpongeBob says: "La-la, la-la, la-la!"
SpongeBob says: "La-la, la-la, la-la..."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, lady!"
Plankton says: "Why, SpongeBob."
Plankton says: "Don't you recognize me?"
SpongeBob says: "Ehh, not really..."
Plankton says: "It's me, your dear old great-grammyma!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow, my very own great-grammyma."
SpongeBob says: "Why have we never met?"
Plankton says: "I want to know all about your life—"
Plankton says: "your job, where the secret formula is..."
Plankton says: "I mean..."
SpongeBob says: "I'm so glad you came back..."
SpongeBob says: "Pretty neat photo album, eh, Double-G Grammyma?"
Plankton says: "It was certainly interesting, but I'd like to hear about your more recent affairs, like where you work, for instance."
SpongeBob says: "Ha, ha, ha, ha, don't worry."
SpongeBob says: "I've got pictures of that too..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "but we have a couple more from my early childhood to get through first."
Plankton says: "Never let it be said that I didn't suffer for my occupation."
SpongeBob says: "Great-Graaaaaaamyma..."
SpongeBob says: "?"
Plankton says: "Huh?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Plankton says: "?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Plankton says: "Oh, I had the most horrible dream of my life!"
Plankton says: "I was dressed up as..."
Plankton says: "!"
Plankton says: "Holy mother of Neptune, it's true."
SpongeBob says: "Good morning."
SpongeBob says: "I'll go and fix us a nice breakfast, and then we'll spend the whole day together!"
Plankton says: "Uh, sounds delightful."
SpongeBob says: "So, Grammyma, what kinds of things do you active seniors like to do?"
Plankton says: "Actually, SpongeBob, I said I wanted to see your life, remember?"
SpongeBob says: "Hmmmm..."
Plankton says: "I want to know all about your life—"
Plankton says: "your job, where the secret formula is..."
Plankton says: "I mean..."
SpongeBob says: "No, you couldn't possibly care about any of that stuff."
SpongeBob says: "Your life must be way more full and exciting."
Plankton says: "Well, uh..."
SpongeBob says: "Ahhh."
SpongeBob says: "Isn't this tea delicious, Grandma?"
Plankton says: "Why, yes!"
SpongeBob says: "Knitting circles sure are fun, eh, Grammyma?"
Plankton says: "Nope."
SpongeBob says: "Why are you not having fun?"
Plankton says: "Why?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Plankton says: "Because I don't knit, you nitwit!"
SpongeBob says: "Are you sure?"
SpongeBob says: "'Cause you make a real nice scarf."
SpongeBob says: "Grandma, you getting bored?"
Plankton says: "No, I'm getting hungry."
Plankton says: "I can feel my own stomach acids eating away at my organs."
Plankton says: "I could eat a village!"
SpongeBob says: "Would you settle for a Krabby Patty?"
Plankton says: "Uh, SpongeBob, would you mind terribly if we used the rear entrance?"
Plankton says: "I'm a little shy around new people."
SpongeBob says: "Hmm..."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Grammy, do antenna run in our family?"
Plankton says: "Antenna..."
Plankton says: "What?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Plankton says: "No, I..."
Plankton says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Plankton says: "AAAH!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, you have been warned about lurking back here on your days off!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm just bringing in my great-grammyma for some lunch."
Squidward says: "Your what?"
SpongeBob says: "My great-grammyma!"
SpongeBob says: "She must be hiding."
SpongeBob says: "Well, she did say she was shy."
Squidward says: "Right..."
SpongeBob says: "Grammy, there you are."
SpongeBob says: "I was starting to worry."
Plankton says: "Never mind."
Plankton says: "Just get me into the kitchen!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, here it is."
Plankton says: "At last!"
SpongeBob says: "Grandma, I'm just gonna go make sure the restrooms are stocked."
SpongeBob says: "You, know, real quick—"
SpongeBob says: "it's part of my day-off duties."
Plankton says: "Okay."
Plankton says: "I'll be standing right here when you get back, and not off somewhere snooping around for the secret formula or anything."
SpongeBob says: "Ha, ha, ha..."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Plankton says: "Nothing, go ahead!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Grammyma, that's taken care of."
SpongeBob says: "I..."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Double-Great-Grammy-Grams, you were so soft and fragile like a..."
SpongeBob says: "like a..."
SpongeBob says: "like a..."
SpongeBob says: "like a balloon!"
Plankton says: "SpongeBob, SpongeBob, up here!"
SpongeBob says: "Grandma, is that you?"
SpongeBob says: "Are you all right?"
Plankton says: "Oh!"
Plankton says: "I'm all right, but I've been ground to a pulp."
Plankton says: "If only there was a nice, cool, safe place nearby, like a safe nearby, where I could rest and recover."
SpongeBob says: "Well, there is the safe where Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs keeps the Krusty Krab secret formula that Plankton's been trying to steal for the past bunch of years, but I don't think he'd mind if my dear old grammyma rests in there."
Plankton says: "Why would he?"
SpongeBob says: "Here you go."
SpongeBob says: "I'll come back for you a little later."
Plankton says: "Oh, I feel better already."
SpongeBob says: "Sweet dreams, Grammyma."
Plankton says: "Sweet dreams, indeed, fool."
Plankton says: "Only this dream is about to become a nightmare, for Mr."
Plankton says: "Krabs!"
Plankton says: "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha..."
Plankton says: "!"
Grandma Plankton says: "Plankton!"
Grandma Plankton says: "You've been a very naughty boy, Plankton!"
Plankton says: "B-But-But-But I..."
Grandma Plankton says: "I've been looking all over for this stuff!"
Plankton says: "Grandma, I can explain!"
SpongeBob says: "Grandma?"
SpongeBob says: "You caught Plankton!"
SpongeBob says: "Let me guess—"
SpongeBob says: "trying to steal the secret formula, right?"
Grandma Plankton says: "Get out of my way, rapscallion!"
