One morning at SpongeBob's pineapple, SpongeBob looks out the window, then goes out in the hallway. He yawns and sticks his tongue out. Then he comes out wearing a pair of goggles over his eyes rather than his usual pair of glasses to go jellyfishing. He clears his throat.
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "All ready to go jellyfishing today?"
Patrick says: "No."
Patrick says: "Just kidding!"
SpongeBob laughs. Patrick shows a net with two scoops.
SpongeBob says: "I see you even brought your double net."
Patrick says: "Yep."
Patrick says: "It's three times as fun."
SpongeBob says: "Um, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Don't you mean twice as fun?"
Patrick says: "What is?"
SpongeBob says: "Your—"
SpongeBob says: "never mind."
Patrick says: "Oh, SpongeBob, That reminds me."
Patrick says: "We should probably check the weather report before we go."
SpongeBob says: "Good idea."
Cuts back to the pineapple where Patrick and SpongeBob are watching the weather report on TV.
Phil says: "And now the weather."
SpongeBob says: "Here we go."
Bob Preflumster says: "Thank you, Phil."
Bob Preflumster says: "Today's weather forecast calls for—"
Bob Preflumster says: "A horrible storm will ravage the Bikini Bottom area."
Patrick says: "A horrible storm?"
SpongeBob says: "A horrible storm?"
Bob Preflumster says: "You heard me."
Bob Preflumster says: "Panic is not advised although it is recommended."
Bob Preflumster says: "Also, an advisory has been issued to avoid any and all jellyfishing if possible."
TV turns off, SpongeBob now stands in front of his living room window with some boards in his hands.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, help me get these boards nailed up."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, this seems like a strange time to start decorating."
SpongeBob says: "Start dec—"
SpongeBob says: "you sir, obviously do not recognize fine decorating when you see it."
He goes up to his big bass on the wall to show Patrick what he is talking about.
Patrick says: "Hmm."
SpongeBob says: "Admire it later, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Right now, we got to get my house converted into a shelter capable of withstanding extreme weather."
Patrick says: "You can say that again."
SpongeBob says: "Actually, I can't."
Patrick says: "Why?"
SpongeBob says: "Because I just stepped on one of these nails."
Squidward says: "La da dee, la da da, la da doo."
Squidward says: "Got ya."
Squidward says: "Now just one quick flick of the wrist, and—"
He falls and bumps his head on his toilet. He looks at his ripped skin and growls angrily.
Squidward says: "Grr!"
Scene cuts to SpongeBob's pineapple where SpongeBob and Patrick are hammering his door.
Patrick says: "Violin."
SpongeBob says: "Whoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Nice work, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "Now my house can withstand anything nature has to throw at us."
Squidward angrily knocks down SpongeBob's door.
Patrick says: "I guess Squidward's not part of nature."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Did you come to weather out the storm with us?"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "I—"
Squidward says: "what storm?"
SpongeBob says: "The one Preflumster told us about."
Squidward says: "Who's that?"
Patrick says: "He's the weatherman on the news channel."
Patrick says: "He said—"
Squidward says: "I can't understand a word you're saying."
SpongeBob says: "C'mon Squidward, it'll be fun!"
SpongeBob says: "While the elements rage outside, we'll snuggle in here and pass the time by playing board games, and playing tic-tac-toe, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and playing tic-tac-toe, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and watchin' TV, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and playin' board games, and drinkin' hot tea..."
Patrick says: "I thought it was cocoa!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah."
SpongeBob says: "Hot cocoa..."
SpongeBob says: "we'll be drinking."
Patrick says: "That's better."
Squidward says: "Well, I think I'll pass."
SpongeBob says: "Even if I let you borrow my huggly snuggly bunny slippers?"
Squidward says: "Hmm, I'll have to think about that."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, but you better think fast."
SpongeBob says: "Because Patrick really likes my—"
Squidward starts to leave when a bolt of lightning strikes. Squidward comes back burnt from the lightning strike.
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, welcome back!"
SpongeBob says: "Here's your slippers."
SpongeBob says: "That's better."
Squidward says: "What's better about it?"
Squidward says: "I liked it better before, when I could see!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, the lights went out."
Squidward says: "Yes, they did, when you turned them off!"
Patrick spits out his cocoa.
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "What is it?"
Patrick says: "I never realized how delicious your hot cocoa is."
SpongeBob says: "Thank you, Patrick."
Squidward says: "Oh, boy."
Squidward says: "How about some of those games you promised?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, boys, let's roll to see who goes first."
Squidward says: "This is tic-tac-toe."
Squidward says: "You don't roll to see who goes first."
Patrick says: "He's right."
Patrick says: "You play rock, paper, scissors for it."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah."
Patrick says: "One."
SpongeBob says: "Two."
Squidward says: "Three!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, it's a tie."
Patrick says: "Darn it!"
Patrick says: "One, two, three."
SpongeBob says: "One, two, three."
Squidward says: "One, two, three."
Patrick says: "Darn it!"
Patrick says: "I'll get you next time."
Squidward says: "One, two, three."
SpongeBob says: "Tie."
Patrick says: "Darn it!"
Squidward says: "One, two, three."
SpongeBob says: "Tie."
Patrick says: "Darn it!"
Squidward says: "There, I win."
Squidward says: "See?"
SpongeBob and Patrick are thinking; Patrick is wearing is a bow on his chest and has a pencil on his ear, and SpongeBob is wearing a visor with reading glasses.
Patrick says: "I'm not seeing anything there."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, it looks like a lot of junk."
Squidward says: "What do you mean, you're not seeing anything?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "There's three in a row right here."
Squidward says: "Tic-tac-toe!"
Patrick says: "Easy, friend."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, relax, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "We're just here to have fun."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, okay, yeah, okay."
SpongeBob says: "Here we go."
SpongeBob says: "Congratulations, Squidward."
SpongeBob and Patrick clap.
Patrick says: "Well played."
Squidward looks as if he's about to cry. Yet another shot of the pineapple.
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "You can do it."
Patrick groans.
SpongeBob says: "Be the puzzle piece."
Patrick says: "Cannot complete jigsaw puzzle!"
Patrick says: "Difficulty level too advanced."
Patrick says: "Rate of brain activity increasing."
Patrick says: "Aging process by 30 years per second."
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Grandpa, you can do it."
SpongeBob says: "You still got a good few years left in you."
Patrick says: "Eh?"
SpongeBob says: "Go, Patrick, go!"
SpongeBob says: "Go, Patrick, Go!"
SpongeBob says: "Go, Patrick, go!"
SpongeBob says: "Go, Patrick, go!"
Squidward wakes up from a nap.
Squidward says: "Grrr!"
SpongeBob says: "Go, Patrick, go!"
Squidward says: "I told you creatures I was trying to take a nap over here."
Squidward says: "Now for the last time can't you just—"
SpongeBob says: "Hang on, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick was just about to figure out where this last piece of the puzzle goes."
SpongeBob says: "Weren't you, Patrick?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "Who's the green guy?"
Squidward says: "It's the last piece of the puzzle!"
Squidward says: "There's only one place it can go."
Squidward says: "Right here!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "It wasn't your turn."
SpongeBob says: "That's cheating."
Squidward says: "Cheating?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "It's a jigsaw puzzle!"
Squidward says: "You can't cheat!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, it's okay, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "We'll just start over."
SpongeBob jumbles the pieces, Squidward mumbles.
Squidward says: "I've got to get out of here!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, welcome back, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "We were about to figure out where the first piece of the puzzle goes."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, maybe Squidward can help us fig—"
Squidward says: "No, I can't."
SpongeBob says: "Please, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "No way."
SpongeBob says: "Please..."
Squidward says: "I have an even better idea."
SpongeBob says: "What is it?"
Patrick says: "Tell us."
SpongeBob says: "Tell us!"
Patrick says: "Tell us!"
SpongeBob says: "Tell us!"
Patrick says: "Tell us!"
SpongeBob says: "Tell us!"
Patrick says: "Tell us!"
SpongeBob says: "Tell us!"
Patrick says: "Tell us!"
Squidward says: "Shh."
Squidward says: "Quiet time."
Squidward says: "It's a game called "boundaries."
Patrick says: "Ooh-ooh-ooh!"
Squidward says: "Yes, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Will there be any spelling in this game?"
Squidward says: "Oh, no, no spelling."
Patrick says: "Yes!"
Squidward says: "It's very simple."
Squidward says: "The object of the game is to see how long everyone leaves Squidward alone until the storm passes."
Squidward says: "He will stay inside boundaries, he'll define by chalk lines on the floor."
SpongeBob says: "I have a question."
Squidward says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "Where are you going to get the chalk?"
Squidward says: "I brought some!"
Squidward says: "Brilliant work, as usual, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Now all I have to do is sit here until this storm blows over."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Halt!"
SpongeBob says: "Nobody's to cross this boundary."
Squidward says: "I'm the one who drew the line."
Squidward says: "You're not supposed to cross."
SpongeBob says: "If you're the one who drew it, let me see some identification papers."
Squidward says: "Identific—"
Squidward says: "?"
Squidward says: "Fine."
Squidward says: "But when this storm blows over, you'll regret this, mister."
Squidward says: "What the—"
Squidward says: "what?"
Squidward says: "I don't have them."
Squidward says: "they must be in my other pants."
Squidward says: "Look, if you just let me cross, I can go get them."
Squidward says: "Please, I promise I'll—"
SpongeBob says: "Hmm."
SpongeBob says: "You may be telling the truth."
Squidward says: "Oh, thank you."
Squidward says: "I'm just so hungry."
SpongeBob says: "But then again, you may not."
SpongeBob says: "Come with me."
SpongeBob says: "We shall find out the truth."
Squidward says: "That'll be the day."
Squidward runs downstairs, SpongeBob blows his whistle. Squidward makes it towards the kitchen, and start taking food from SpongeBob's refrigerator.
SpongeBob says: "Stop that cephalopod!"
Squidward says: "Please."
Squidward says: "I just want to get back..."
Squidward says: "onto my side of boundary."
SpongeBob says: "This, I cannot allow."
SpongeBob says: "It is against the rules."
Squidward says: "But all I wanted was something to eat."
Patrick says: "Did somebody say something to eat?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, look out!"
Squidward says: "Whoa!"
SpongeBob and Squidward run into Patrick leaving food everywhere.
Squidward says: "My food!"
SpongeBob says: "Your food?"
Patrick says: "Hey, I want some too."
Squidward says: "Is this what we've really come to?"
Squidward says: "Is one little storm all it takes to turn us all into complete animals?"
SpongeBob says: "Apparently so."
SpongeBob says: "Well, that and a refrigerator full of food anyways."
Squidward says: "Hey, did you hear that?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, it's just Patrick gnawing on his can."
Squidward says: "No, no, no, no, no, no, not that."
Squidward says: "I mean from outside."
SpongeBob says: "I don't hear anything."
Squidward says: "The storm must've stopped."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, wait!"
Squidward says: "Woo-hoo!"
Squidward says: "So long, suckers!"
SpongeBob's pineapple is now at the top of a tornado and Squidward falls down from the top to the ground.
Squidward says: "Oof!"
Squidward says: "Oh, curse you, Preflumster!"
