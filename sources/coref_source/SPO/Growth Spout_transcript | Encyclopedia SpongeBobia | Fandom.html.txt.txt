Mr. Krabs says: "I wasn't stealing food!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "How could you do this to me?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, I'm sorry, I had no other choice."
SpongeBob says: "Coming over for a slumber party without even giving me a chance to put my best PJs on?"
SpongeBob says: "I mean, look at these things."
SpongeBob says: "Just give me one minute to change, and when I get back, we can get started on some s'mores and popcorn."
Mr. Krabs says: "G-g-good idea, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "That sounds just perfect."
Squidward says: "Not so fast!"
Squidward says: "That crab is a food thief!"
Squidward says: "He snuck into my house in the middle of the night, stole every last morsel in my kitchen, and he even swiped my entire collection of smoked kielbasas."
SpongeBob says: "But I thought he was having a slumber party at my house."
Squidward says: "I don't care."
Squidward says: "I'm calling the police."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward, wait, you can't."
Squidward says: "Oh?"
Squidward says: "And why is that?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Because if you do, I'll fire ya."
Mr. Krabs says: "No, if I go to prison, who's gonna feed Pearl?"
Squidward says: "Hello, police?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hold it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll..."
Squidward says: "You'll what?"
Squidward says: "You'll give me your golden tooth?"
Mr. Krabs sniffles, and yanks out his golden tooth. He gives it to Squidward.
SpongeBob says: "I didn't even know Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs had a gold tooth."
Squidward says: "Neither did I."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, SpongeBob, what am I gonna do?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, don't worry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I had a tooth pulled a few years ago."
SpongeBob says: "Only hurts for a couple of days."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's not that, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Those nerves died years ago."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's me dear daughter, Pearl."
SpongeBob says: "Pearl?"
SpongeBob says: "What happened?"
Mr. Krabs says: "She's going through one of them growth spurts, and I can't find a way to feed her."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, you're the owner of the most delightfully delicious restaurant in Bikini Bottom!"
SpongeBob says: "Why don't you just take her there to eat?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hold on, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "I said I was trying to feed me daughter, not completely obliterate me inventory."
SpongeBob says: "You don't have to do that."
SpongeBob says: "I know a special ingredient that can make one Krabby Patty taste like a million."
Pearl says: "Oh, Oh!"
Pearl says: "So hungry, not gonna make it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, hurry it up!"
SpongeBob says: "Hang in there, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Almost ready."
Pearl says: "Daddy, I'm not hungry anymore, and I've stopped growing."
Pearl says: "I feel great."
Pearl says: "Heh, Heh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Whew!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Boy, I'm glad that's over."
Mr. Krabs says: "And it only cost me one Krabby Patty."
Mr. Krabs says: "Say, what was that secret ingredient you used in there, anyways, boy?"
SpongeBob says: "It was love, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "It was love."
Mr. Krabs says: "Eh?"
