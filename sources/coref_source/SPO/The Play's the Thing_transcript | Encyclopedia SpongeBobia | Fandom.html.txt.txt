Mail Man walks to the Krusty Krab, whistling a tune, he enters the Krusty Krab and walks to the counter.
Mail Man says: "Delivery for Mr."
Mail Man says: "Squidward Tentacles."
Squidward is not seen at his post.
Mail Man says: "Hello?"
Mail Man says: "Anybody here?"
SpongeBob gasps.
SpongeBob says: "Squidward's not at his post!"
SpongeBob peeks through the window, and descends again. He makes a balloon of Squidward.
SpongeBob says: "Hmm!"
SpongeBob says: "There's something missing."
SpongeBob says: "Ah!"
SpongeBob puts his hat on the top of the balloon of Squidward. SpongeBob laughs.
Mail Man says: "Hello!"
Mail Man says: "Yoo-hoo?"
Mail Man says: "Mail delivery!"
SpongeBob says: "Hello, I'm Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Welcome to the Krusty Krab where we never leave our post."
SpongeBob says: "And how may I help you on this fine day?"
Balloon of Squidward's nose deflates.
Mail Man says: "Right..."
Mail Man puts the mail on the top of the balloon of Squidward. Mail Man runs away from the Krusty Krab and screams. The balloon of Squidward pops. Squidward rises from the floor.
Squidward says: "Hey!"
Squidward says: "It's hard to get my beauty sleep when people keep dropping junk on my head."
Squidward says: "Whoopee!"
Squidward says: "Ha ha ha!"
Squidward says: "Whoopee!"
SpongeBob runs in.
SpongeBob says: "Pee!"
SpongeBob says: "Pee."
Squidward's look of happiness fades.
Squidward says: "Whoop..."
SpongeBob says: "Pee!"
Mr. Krabs appears.
Mr. Krabs says: "Avast, there."
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you all happy about?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm on my happy break, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "You, I'm used to."
Mr. Krabs says: "Why is he so happy?"
Squidward says: "I'm holding a package from famous producer Buddy Barracuda."
Squidward says: "I sent him my play and now, he's gonna produce it!"
Squidward leans to Mr. Krabs.
Squidward says: "I quit."
Squidward walks off.
Squidward says: "So long, losers!"
Squidward walks and opens the letter.
Squidward says: "Let's see here."
Squidward says: "Ahem."
Squidward says: "Oh, yeah."
He reads the letter out loud and walks to a table where Dale and Abigail-Marge are eating.
Squidward says: ""Thank you for submitting your play, entitled 'Squidward: Strokes of Genius'."
Squidward says: "Your work speaks volumes about you as an artist, a person, and a member of society."
He walks away from Abigail-Marge and Dale, still reading the letter, and walks out the door.
Squidward says: "So it is with great pleasure that we announce we will not be doing your play."
Squidward stops in his tracks and walks back into the Krusty Krab. He retakes his place at the counter. He puts his hat back on his head and sighs dejectedly.
SpongeBob says: "Hey!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "You're back from your amazing success as a playwriter!"
Squidward groans. SpongeBob examines his sleeve.
SpongeBob says: "And your shirt, is that a cotton-poly blend?"
SpongeBob says: "Faaancy!"
He looks at Squidward's head, gasps, removes his hat, and massages his scalp.
SpongeBob says: "And just look at your stylish new hairdo."
SpongeBob looks at Squidward's letter.
SpongeBob says: "Say, is that a copy of your play?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, my goodness!"
SpongeBob says: "Are you going to put on your amazing play in our little old Krusty Krab?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, you are a true patron of the arts, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Well, I suppose that could work."
Squidward says: "If people see my play, they'll recognize my genius!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Me customers come here for greasy food at high prices."
Mr. Krabs says: "Not for singin' and dancin'."
SpongeBob says: "But, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, people pay to eat, right?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Of course."
SpongeBob says: "And they would pay to watch a play, right?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Um, I suppose..."
SpongeBob says: "Well, if they eat and watch a play, you can charge twice as much!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Really?"
Mr. Krabs says: "How about four times as much?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I don't see why not!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well..."
Mr. Krabs says: "okay."
Mr. Krabs says: "But only on one condition: that you both keep workin'."
Mr. Krabs says: "Because if just one Krabby Patty is late, I'm shuttin' you down!"
SpongeBob says: "Hmm."
SpongeBob says: "Now what will we call this eating dinner and watching theater?"
Squidward says: "Dinner theater?"
Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh.
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, you."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, sure."
SpongeBob says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Come on, let's get serious."
SpongeBob says: "We need a title that sounds..."
SpongeBob says: "dramatic!"
SpongeBob says: "Got it!"
SpongeBob says: "We'll call it "Singy Eaty Time!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I love it!"
Outside the Krusty Krab, there is a long line of anchovies waiting for auditions. They say "Meep" repeatedly. Inside the Krusty Krab is a large crowd of anchovies, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward.
Squidward says: "Wow!"
Squidward says: "Look at all these aspiring actors wanting to take part in my genius!"
Mr. Krabs laughs.
Mr. Krabs says: "And all of them willin' to work for no pay!"
The anchovies say "meep" a few more times, then run out the door. When the dust clears, the only one left is SpongeBob.
SpongeBob says: "Did I get the part?"
Squidward says: "You got all the parts."
SpongeBob does karate moves and shouts. He jumps to the other side.
Squidward says: "And we let him handle our food?"
[Nighttime says: ": Singy Eaty Time with Squidward Tentacles"."
outside the Krusty Krab says: ": Singy Eaty Time with Squidward Tentacles"."
a sign reads "Opening Tonight says: ": Singy Eaty Time with Squidward Tentacles"."
Frankie Billy says: "Huh..."
Frankie Billy says: "Singy Eaty Time with Squidward Tentacles."
The fish walks to a curtain.
Frank says: "Hello, can I order?"
Frank says: "Hello?"
Frank walks away. Squidward peeks from behind the curtain.
Squidward says: "It's time!"
Squidward runs to Mr. Krabs, who is at the controls.
Squidward says: "Places, people, places!"
Mr. Krabs speaks into a microphone.
Mr. Krabs says: "Please take your seats."
Squidward says: "Dim the house lights."
Mr. Krabs pulls a lever marked, Lights 1. Outside, the lights go out completely and that can be seen are the fish's eyes. The fish holding the soda slips and falls, shouting. Mr. Krabs pulls a lever marked Lights 2. SpongeBob stands at the grill. The lights go out, but the Krabby Patty catches fire, providing light.
Squidward says: "Bring up the stage lights!"
Mr. Krabs pulls a lever marked Stage Lights. The light returns to the Krusty Krab. Harold is seen gnawing on Nat's arm. They look at each other in surprise. Nat presents Harold with a salt shaker. Harold sprinkles salt on Nat's arm and resumes gnawing on it.
Squidward says: "Raise the curtain!"
Mr. Krabs pulls the rope, raising the curtain.
Mr. Krabs says: "How much am I gettin' for this?"
The curtains rise, and Squidward rises to the counter. The play begins.
Squidward says: "Onto this world, an octopus was born."
Squidward says: "A cephalopod with promise and potential."
Fish says: "Um, I'd like a Double Krabby meal with extra kelp..."
Squidward pushes him away.
Squidward says: "Go away, go away, shoo, shoo, go away, go away."
Mr. Krabs appears from the window behind Squidward.
Mr. Krabs says: "What did I tell you?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You do your job, or I'm shuttin' you down!"
Squidward says: "Fine."
Squidward walks to the customer with his order on a tray.
Squidward says: "He had promise until he came to work here, at the Krusty Krab."
Squidward says: "Serving local morons heart-stopping, artery-clogging garbage, masquerading as food."
He drops the tray on the fish's table.
Fish says: "Yay-hey!"
Squidward returns to the stage.
Squidward says: "At the Krusty Krab, his talent was wasted."
Nathaniel says: "Excuse me, can I get a refill?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward..."
Squidward says: "Yes, you can."
Squidward walks to Nathaniel with a bucket of soda and splashes it onto him.
Squidward says: "But, who will refill the empty chasm in my soul?"
Nathaniel trembles.
Nathaniel says: "I..."
Nathaniel says: "don't know, man..."
Nathaniel says: "I don't know."
Squidward returns to the stage.
Squidward says: "His life shattered."
Squidward says: "Is there any task too demeaning for our hero?"
Nat says: "Hey, my Krabby Patty doesn't have ketchup."
Squidward says: "It would appear not."
Squidward says: "No ketchup!"
Squidward says: "That's terrible!"
Squidward says: "Here, let me help you with that."
Squidward squirts ketchup on Nat.
Squidward says: "Would any of you want this job?"
The audience shakes their heads no, and murmurs "no".
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You get that customer a fresh patty with ketchup!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And don't forget to charge him again!"
Squidward says: "And then, there's my skinflint boss."
Mr. Krabs says: "What's that, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Umm, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, I'm acting."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, well, that's okay, then."
Mr. Krabs says: "But get him a Krabby Patty!"
Squidward says: "Fine."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "One Krabby Patty with ketchup!"
Squidward says: "And now, we come to the worst part of my job..."
Squidward says: "working with him."
The stage rotates so the kitchen is seen.
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Um, ahem, ah..."
SpongeBob says: "I..."
SpongeBob says: "uh..."
SpongeBob says: "I forgot my lines!"
Squidward says: "You don't have any lines!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't?"
Squidward says: "D'oh!"
Squidward says: "Just stand there and act like..."
Squidward says: "yourself!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I can do that!"
SpongeBob says: "Ahem!"
SpongeBob says: "One Krabby Patty coming up!"
He puts five patties on the grill. He sees a wrapper on the ground.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, what is this."
SpongeBob says: "A stray wrapper in my kitchen."
He prepares to put it in the trash, but there's no room for it.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, the trash is full."
SpongeBob says: "I had better call..."
SpongeBob says: "the garbage truck."
He acts like a garbage truck, making sounds effects for backing up and lifting the trash.
Squidward says: "Talent."
Squidward says: "Outstanding."
Squidward says: "Thank you, that'll do."
Squidward says: "Ahem."
Frankie Billy says: "Hey, man!"
Frankie Billy says: "Where's my Krabby Patty?"
Squidward says: "His genius was unrecognized."
Frankie Billy says: "Come on, man!"
Frankie Billy says: "I just want my patty!"
Nat says: "Yeah, me too!"
Squidward gives them dirty looks. As he recites his lines, SpongeBob continues to act like a garbage truck.
Squidward says: "Taken for granted, uncredited, overlooked, ignored."
Squidward says: "Disrespected, unappreciated, unloved."
Squidward says: "But worst of all..."
Squidward says: "underpaid."
Mr. Krabs sits at a table and laughs.
Mr. Krabs says: "It's funny, 'cause it's true!"
Nat looks at his watch and taps Frankie Billy on the shoulder.
Nat says: "He's done."
Nat says: "Order."
Squidward says: "And furthermore!"
Nat says: "Oh, there's furthermore."
Squidward says: "wasted."
The fish are joined by more impatient customers.
Frankie Billy says: "Oh, come on!"
Fish mob says: "We want Krabby Patties!"
Fish mob says: "We want Krabby Patties!"
Fish mob says: "We want Krabby Patties!"
Fish mob says: "We want Krabby Patties!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You still haven't given me customers their Krabby Patties!"
Squidward says: "All right!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, where's that Patty?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob is still acting like a garbage truck. He stops and notices the patties are burnt. He screams at the sight of the ruined patties.
SpongeBob says: "What have I done?"
SpongeBob says: "Have I let the lure of theater production get between me and my patties?"
He presents Squidward with a plate of burnt Krabby Patties in buns.
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, forgive me."
SpongeBob says: "I let the glamour of the stage distract me from my true calling: Making sure that every patty I prepare is the best it can be."
Squidward says: "Uh-huh."
He takes the patties from SpongeBob.
SpongeBob says: "No, Squidward, no."
SpongeBob says: "Those patties aren't fit for public consumption."
Squidward says: "Here!"
Squidward says: "Enjoy!"
He hurls the patties to waiting customers as SpongeBob screams out. A fish removes the top bun and sees the patty is black.
Frankie Billy says: "Ugh!"
He replaces the bun and bangs the Krabby Patty on the stage.
Frankie Billy says: "Oh, come on!"
Frankie Billy says: "All that waiting for this?!"
Frankie Billy says: "!"
Squidward says: "Oh, puh-leeze."
Squidward says: "You wouldn't know quality if it hit you in the face!"
He gets a burnt patty thrown at him. It makes a clang sound when it strikes him. He has a lump where the patty hit him.
Squidward says: "D'oh!"
Squidward says: "I said if it hit you in the face!"
Frankie Billy says: "Whoa!"
Frankie Billy says: "That was worth the wait!"
Frankie Billy says: "I'll take two more!"
Frank says: "I'll take five!"
Nat says: "I wanna throw something at him!"
Mr. Krabs gets a very happy look on his face. The crowd is waving money, also wanting to throw things at Squidward. SpongeBob steps in.
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Gentle patrons, Krabby Patties are meant to be eaten, not flung."
SpongeBob says: "Think of all the joy these greasy, juicy patties and their attendant condiments have given you."
Harold says: "Gosh, he's right."
Frank says: "We shouldn't be so disrespectful of our favorite meal."
SpongeBob sniffles and wipes away a tear.
SpongeBob says: "Bless you all."
Patrick says: "I like throwing food."
He hurls a burnt Krabby Patty at SpongeBob.
Fish Crowd says: "Food fight!"
The customers throw food at SpongeBob and Squidward, who shield themselves from the onslaught. Mr. Krabs stands beside a large pile of burnt Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs says: "And for you?"
Frank says: "I'll take twenty."
Mr. Krabs gives him a large stack of Krabby Patties. Nathaniel is next in line.
Nathaniel says: "Do you have anything heavier?"
Mr. Krabs gives him an anchor.
Mr. Krabs says: "Certainly."
The customers throw all kinds of foods and other objects at Squidward and SpongeBob. When Squidward looks at the crowd, he screams. Patrick hurls an anchor at him, giggling goofily.
Squidward says: "Oh boy."
When the anchor lands, the set is destroyed. SpongeBob and Squidward are covered with lumps, bruises, and garbage.
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
He runs onstage with a bag of money.
Mr. Krabs says: "Good news."
Mr. Krabs says: "The play is such a success, I've added two more shows and a matinee!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Break a leg tomorrow!"
Mr. Krabs runs off stage. Squidward and SpongeBob look at the camera and laugh maniacally. A burnt patty hits Squidward in the head and he falls down. SpongeBob laughs even more maniacally.
