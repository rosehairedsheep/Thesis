The camera zooms in on Sandy's treedome. There is a silhouette of Sandy in the tree.
Sandy says: "Almost done..."
Sandy says: "Could you hand me that wrench, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Nuh uh uh!"
SpongeBob says: "Lab partner!"
Sandy says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "You called me SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "I thought we agreed to address each other by our proper titles."
Sandy says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh ta ta ta!"
SpongeBob says: "Lab partner!"
Sandy takes the wrench in front of SpongeBob. SpongeBob looks sad.
Sandy says: "There!"
Sandy says: "It's finished!"
Sandy says: "Now I can hide my nuts back in Texas without leavin' my lab!"
She picks up a pile of nuts and puts them in her machine and pulls a lever. The machine rumbles, and a lightbulb blinks. The camera then shows Sandy and SpongeBob watching.
SpongeBob says: "We did it!"
Then the machine rumbles again, and the nuts appear right next to the machine.
Sandy says: "Aw, nuts!"
The camera zooms on the Chum Bucket, and a shot of Plankton's lab appears. Plankton is seen working on a machine with cloth over it.. He puts down his blowtorch and mask.
Plankton says: "Finally!"
Plankton says: "The day has come!"
Karen says: "You mean Thursday?"
Plankton says: "No!"
Plankton says: "It's the day I steal the Krabby Patty secret formula from Krabs!"
Karen says: "And why, pretell, is today different from the other days you failed to steal it?"
Karen says: "What exactly am I beholding?"
Karen says: "A vegetable steamer?"
Plankton says: "This is no ordinary vegetable steamer, Karen, my computer wife."
Plankton says: "It's my latest invention!"
Plankton says: "And isn't she a beauty."
Plankton says: "Meow."
Karen says: "Oh, brother."
Plankton says: "Sweetie, you're going to help me achieve my defined purpose, aren't you, yes?"
Plankton says: "And steal the Krabby Patty recipe!"
Plankton says: "Muhahahahaha!"
Plankton says: "Whew!"
Plankton says: "Man, is it hot in here?"
Broccoli says: "Tell me about it."
He bursts out the Chum Bucket, still laughing, and squeezes into the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is seen, mumbling "Money, money, money, money!". Plankton goes in Krabs' office.
Plankton says: "Hehehehe!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, how much is that- Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabs gets cut off by Plankton going through his eyes."
Mr. Krabs says: "Eugh!"
Plankton says: "Finally, the moment has come!"
Plankton says: "Hey!"
Plankton says: "Cut it out!"
SpongeBob says: "Plankton?"
SpongeBob says: "is that you?"
Plankton says: "Of course it's me, you moron."
Sandy says: "You were able to convert yourself into gaseous form?"
Sandy says: "Fascinatin'!"
Plankton says: "Huh?"
Plankton says: "Wait!"
Sandy puts him in a jar and puts him in the freezer. Sandy waits, and then takes it out. She shakes Plankton out, and he turns to normal.
Sandy says: "I guess I never realized you were such a student of science."
Sandy says: "Maybe you could help me fix my nut transporter."
Plankton says: "Eh?"
Plankton says: "Did you say transporter?"
Plankton says: "Hey!"
Plankton says: "Maybe if I combine this device with my own invention, the Krabby Patty formula will be mine!"
Plankton says: "I mean, I think I have the right parts in my lab, maybe?"
Sandy says: "We're in business!"
Sandy says: "Say!"
Sandy says: "This is a dandy lab!"
Plankton says: "Is that good?"
Sandy says: "Hahahaha!"
Sandy says: "Does a pig play poker?"
Plankton says: "I guess..."
Sandy looks through test tubes.
Sandy says: "I should have visited you before."
Sandy says: "What, with you and me being the only two scientists in town."
Plankton says: "Haha, yes."
SpongeBob comes in, carrying the transporter.
Sandy says: "Yes, sir."
Sandy says: "Your lab is amazing."
Plankton says: "Do you really like it?"
Sandy says: "And how!"
SpongeBob says: "Here's your teleporter, lab partner."
Sandy says: "Thanks, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Can you please call me lab partner?"
Sandy says: "So where do I hook up my teleporter?"
Plankton says: "Oh, just plug it into that doohickey over there."
Karen says: "Just who are you calling a doohickey?"
Sandy says: "Wowee!"
Sandy says: "Is that a real Mark III Surplus W."
Sandy says: "I."
Sandy says: "F."
Sandy says: "E."
Sandy says: "omatic?"
Sandy says: "She is beautiful."
Karen says: "Oh, why, thank you."
Plankton says: "No, not that doohickey."
Plankton says: "This doohickey!"
Plankton says: "Just plug your teleporter into my device, and with our combined power we shall conquer the world!"
Sandy says: "Uh-huh."
Sandy says: "Or I can combine your gasifier with my invention and transform my nuts into a gaseous cloud that transports them back to Texas!"
Plankton says: "Heh."
Plankton says: "Yes, that's what I meant."
Sandy plugs her machine into the gasifyer and the transporter gleamed light from it.
Sandy says: "YES!"
Sandy says: "It's working at last, new lab partner!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I guess you won't be needing me anymore."
Plankton says: "That's right."
Plankton says: "And don't let the door hit you on the way out!"
Sandy says: "Hold on!"
Sandy says: "You can't go, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "We need you."
Plankton says: "What!"
Plankton says: "He'll just get in the way!"
SpongeBob says: "Need me?"
SpongeBob says: "scientist."
Sandy says: "Why, you'll have the most important job of all!"
Sandy says: "You'll be our test monkey."
SpongeBob says: "Test monkey reporting for duty!"
Plankton says: "A test monkey?"
Sandy says: "Ready!"
Plankton says: "Roger!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey!"
SpongeBob says: "Who turned out the lights?"
Sandy says: "Eugh!"
Sandy says: "We only teleported his eyes!"
Plankton says: "Oh, boy."
Plankton says: "Try again!"
Squidward says: "Where is that idiot SpongeBob, leaving me stuck with all the cooking?"
Squidward says: "This job stinks!"
Sandy says: "Oh, well."
Plankton says: "Try again."
Squidward says: "See for yourself!"
Squidward says: "Huh?"
Sandy says: "Just a few more adjustments..."
Plankton says: "Okay."
Plankton says: "Let her rip!"
SpongeBob says: "Do you think this is a good look for me?"
SpongeBob says: "Or is it too flashy?"
Sandy says: "Stand clear!"
SpongeBob says: "Clear of what?"
Squidward says: "Something weird is going on around here."
SpongeBob's mouth says: "Hi, Squidward."
Sandy says: "Hm."
Sandy says: "Now only his mouth is missing."
Plankton says: "Shut it down."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ugh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "For crying out loud, Squidward, what the heck is wrong with you?"
Sandy says: "Test 3!"
Squidward says: "I cannot believe I have to deliver all this junk food myself."
SpongeBob says: "Look, no hands!"
SpongeBob says: "Or feet."
Sandy says: "Well, we're getting closer."
Sandy says: "Goggles!"
Plankton says: "Shall we activate it together?"
Sandy says: "Why, sure enough!"
Sandy says: "Three!"
Plankton says: "Two!"
Sandy says: "One!"
SpongeBob says: "Ooh, I gotta go to the bathroom."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh."
Mr. Krabs says: "Neptune's trousers, Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Maybe you should just lay off the broccoli for a while."
Sandy says: "It worked!"
Sandy says: "We transported his whole body this time!"
Plankton says: "Yes!"
Plankton says: "My plan worked!"
Plankton says: "And now I have no further use for you two goody goodies!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh no!"
SpongeBob says: "Plankton has finally won!"
SpongeBob says: "And we, we helped him."
Sandy says: "Not exactly..."
Sandy says: "lab partner."
Plankton says: "Fools!"
Plankton says: "I played them like a 32-bit synthesizer!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Did you hear something?"
Sandy says: "Aw, I knew Plankton was hatching an evil plan the whole time."
Sandy says: "So I just adjusted the controls to put Plankton where he can't do any harm."
Sandy says: "Nobody fools a squirrel from Texas!"
