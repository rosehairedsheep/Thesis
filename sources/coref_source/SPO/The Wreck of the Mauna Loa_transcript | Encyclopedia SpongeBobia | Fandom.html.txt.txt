SpongeBob says: "Tag, you're it."
Patrick says: "Oh, this game's too hard!"
SpongeBob says: "I know!"
SpongeBob says: "What if both of us are "it?"
Patrick says: "But then, who's gonna be not "it?"
SpongeBob says: "Exactly!"
SpongeBob says: "Neither of us will know!"
Patrick says: "Oh, I like not knowing!"
Patrick says: "Let's play!"

Patrick says: "I'm it!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoa, what is this place?"
Patrick says: "Look at all this cool stuff!"
Patrick says: "Thanks, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "I guess we better be more careful."
SpongeBob says: "Let's go back to the main deck."
Patrick says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow, what's this?"
SpongeBob says: "♪Mauna Loa, how I love ya, oh, my secret lovin' hideaway!"
SpongeBob says: "My Mauna Loa bay-a bay!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob..."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob..."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob..."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "What are you doing?"
Squidward says: "I've been saying I needed a Krabby Patty about a bajillion times!"
Squidward says: "And you w—"
Squidward says: "What the..."
Squidward says: "?"
Squidward says: "Ha ha ha!"
Squidward says: "Nice patty, Michelangelo!"
Squidward says: "Ha!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, that's just my secret—"
SpongeBob says: "Here you go."
Squidward says: "Porous freak."
SpongeBob says: "Whew, that was a close one!"
Patrick says: "Secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hide—"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, please!"
SpongeBob says: "What are you trying to do?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Give away our secret hideout?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Give me that!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's all the racket?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, sorry, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "Patrick, if you're going to distract me fry cook, the least you can do is buy some grub!"
Patrick says: "You got it, Mr."
Patrick says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Back to work, boy."
SpongeBob says: "Sure thing."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's odd."
Patrick says: "Hmm, well, let's see."
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "We've got to get back to our playground."
Patrick says: "Keep the change, my good man!"
Squidward says: "Hmm, a gum wrapper and a coin that says "Mauna Loa"."
Mr. Krabs says: "Mauna Loa?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "As in the shipwreck Mauna Loa?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Legend has it that the largest unfound pirate booty lies..."
Mr. Krabs says: "in its ruins."
Mr. Krabs says: "I have been searching for this treasure nearly me entire adult life!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Lookin' over every nook, every cranny, every dumpster."
Mr. Krabs says: "Once I get me claws on it, I'll be the richest crustacean in the world!"
Squidward says: "Well, I guess that explains this."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hmm, looks like him and Patrick are trying to haul the loot for themselves."
Mr. Krabs says: "Come on, Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "We got to let those two ding-a-lings lead us straight to the Mauna Loa!"
Squidward says: "Actually, I have a hot date with my toenail clippers tonight, but have fun with that."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick, do you think we gave away too much about our secret hideout?"
Patrick says: "Oh, jeez, SpongeBob, who cares if everyone knows about our secret hideout?"
SpongeBob says: "Doesn't that make the secret hideout a little less secrety?"
Patrick says: "No."
Patrick says: "It's just a secret that everybody knows about."
Patrick says: "What's wrong, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Just as I thought."
SpongeBob says: "We're being followed."
SpongeBob says: "That's it!"
SpongeBob says: "Heh, looks like no one was following us to the secret hideout after all!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Found it!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, were you following us?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No."
Mr. Krabs says: "I just saw the sign."
Patrick paints the words "SpongeBob and Patrick's Secret Hideout." SpongeBob sighs at Patrick's actions. Bubble transition changes the scene.
Mr. Krabs says: "So you thought you could hide the treasure from old Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabs, did ya?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm not aware of any treasure."
SpongeBob says: "But I suppose since you're such a nice boss, you can hang out at the hideout."
SpongeBob says: "Just as long as you keep it a secret."
Mr. Krabs says: "Where'd you two blunders find the gold coin?"
SpongeBob says: "If my eyes weren't burning like they were full of lava, I could show you."
Mr. Krabs says: "Heh, jokers."
Bubble transition changes the scene.
Mr. Krabs says: "I knew I'd find it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Check it out, fellas, cool, hard doubloons!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, you might want to take a closer look at your coinage."
Mr. Krabs says: "Eh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's this?"
Mr. Krabs says: ""Token Has No Monetary Value?"
Mr. Krabs says: "" Tokens?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "This must be a decoy."
SpongeBob says: "Ahoy, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Maybe they hid the loot off ship in that shed!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Whee-hee!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What the barnacle?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, it's just full of tickets!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, you usually find tickets in a ticket booth."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ticket booth?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "And why are there height restrictions on the cruit?"
Mr. Krabs says: ""Must Be This Tall To Ride?"
Patrick says: "Well, maybe they had something against short people."
Patrick says: "I like their little clothes."
Bubble transition changes the scene.
SpongeBob says: "Captain's Quarters."
SpongeBob says: "There must be some treasure here, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Patrick says: "No wonder we were so amused!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, I'm not!"
SpongeBob says: "Remember, you're always welcome back at the secret hideout."
Mr. Krabs says: "This place ain't got no treasure!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Keep your worthless hunk of junk!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, but, would you mind keeping this worthless hunk of junk a secret?"
SpongeBob says: "Wouldn't be much of a secret if we had a million people showing up!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh-ho-ho, don't flatten yourself."
Mr. Krabs says: "People want to see the real thing!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's not like a million people just show up to an old amusement park ride for fun."
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait a minute."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's exactly what they do."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh-ho-ho, brace yourself, fellas."
Mr. Krabs says: "Your hideaway's about to become the worst kept secret in the sea!"
Bubble transition changes the scene.
Squidward says: "Welcome to The Wreck of the Mauna Loa."
Squidward says: "Arr."
Squidward says: "How may I help you?"
Dennis says: "I'll take 10 tokens, please."
Mr. Krabs says: "Step right up, don't be shy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Experience the amusement and terror of The Wreck of the Mauna Loa!"
Shows fish are on the boat that is swaying back and forth. A bell  from the boat tolls.
Mr. Krabs says: "That's right, folks!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We spare no expense to restore this plastic ship to its former glory!"
Nazz-Mimi says: "Sorry, honey, but you'll have to come back when you're a big boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh-ho-ho, I disagree."
SpongeBob says: "It's gone, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Our secret paradise is gone forever!"
Patrick says: "And alas, even the joyous shrieks of children cannot lift my sunken heart!"
SpongeBob says: "How 'bout another ride to cheer you up?"
Patrick says: "Let's do this!"
SpongeBob, Patrick, and some fishes are on the boat, which is swinging back and forth.
SpongeBob says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Patrick says: "Whoo-hoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Ha, ha!"
Patrick says: "Ha, ha!"
SpongeBob says: "Woo-hoo!"
Patrick says: "Woo-hoo!"
SpongeBob says: "That was awesome!"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
Patrick says: "Totally realistic!"
Harold says: "Realistic?"
Harold says: "That realism nearly cost us our lives!"
Sally says: "Mr."
Sally says: "Krabs put all our lives in danger with this careless contraption!"
Nazz-Mimi says: "What were you thinking?"
Nazz-Mimi says: "Our little boy could've been hurt on your disaster of a ride!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, people, let's not do anything we might regret!"
Fish Cop says: "Too late for that, Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "What—"
Mr. Krabs says: "what—"
Mr. Krabs says: "what are you talking about?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You can't take me to the pokey!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I—"
Fish Cop says: "For operating a danger to public safety I can, and I will."
Fish Cop says: "Honestly, I think he'll be safer in prison."
Bubble transition changes the scene. The sign says 'Condemned' on top of the sign that Patrick painted.
SpongeBob says: "Well, Patrick, I guess we really lost our secret hideout this time."
Patrick says: "And just when everyone was starting to find out about it, too."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, who knows, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "The next fun, fun place might be just around the corner, huh?"
Patrick says: "Well, I doubt it."
SpongeBob and Patrick scream as they sink to the sand, slamming onto a floorboard. SpongeBob sees a sign.
SpongeBob says: ""The Real Mauna Loa?"
SpongeBob says: "" Ooh, Patrick, do you want to keep a secret?"
Patrick says: "Nope!"
