SpongeBob says: "I'm trying to defeat the Dirty Bubble."

SpongeBob says: "They're filled with eight types of organic sediment that bottom feeders like Gary can't get enough of."
Patrick says: "Eight?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, something like that."
SpongeBob says: "All you really have to do is shake the can."
SpongeBob says: "Gary comes running every time."
SpongeBob says: "Go on, Pat, try it."
Patrick says: "I only tasted six types of sediment."
SpongeBob says: "Gary?"
SpongeBob says: "Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "Gary, where are you?"
SpongeBob says: "Are you under here?"

Squidward says: "Don't they know I'm busy spoiling myself?"
SpongeBob says: "You check over there."
SpongeBob says: "I'll check in here."
SpongeBob says: "Find him yet, Pat?"
Patrick says: "No, but I'll keep looking."
SpongeBob says: "But there's nowhere left to look."
Patrick says: "There's one place we haven't checked."
SpongeBob says: "I doubt Gary could fit in there."
Patrick says: "Can't hurt to look."
SpongeBob says: "Here goes nothing."
SpongeBob says: "Look, Pat!"
Patrick says: "What is it?"
SpongeBob says: "Let's see."
SpongeBob says: ""Dear SpongeBob, These last few years have been some of the best of my life, but I must move on."
SpongeBob says: "Don't bother to come looking for me."
SpongeBob says: "By now, I have probably found a new owner who actually remembers to fill up my food bowl every now and again."
SpongeBob says: "Sincerely, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "At least until my new owner renames me."
SpongeBob says: ""  Dear Neptune, what have I done?"
Patrick says: "What do you mean?"
Patrick says: "You drove him away."
Patrick says: "It's right there in black and white."
Patrick says: "See?"
Patrick says: "Right there and there."

Mr. Krabs says: "Krabs what's wrong."
SpongeBob says: "Well, you see..."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's enough, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "See, it's not always what you say that matters."
Mr. Krabs says: "Sometimes, it's what you don't say."
Mr. Krabs says: "Understand?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I should've told Gary how important he was to me."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, I don't know what that has to do with making Krabby Patties, but I do know this: any problem you have can be solved with a little hard work."
SpongeBob says: "You're right, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's me boy!"
