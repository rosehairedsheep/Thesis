Episode starts at Goo Lagoon. Patrick is running there wearing SpongeBob as a towel, and both are laughing. When they get there, he takes him off, then puts on his swimsuit.
SpongeBob says: "I thought you left your swim suit at home."
Patrick says: "No, I just didn't want to get it all wrinkled up."
Patrick says: "Last one in is a rotten egg!"
SpongeBob says: "Rotten eggs?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Shubie says: "Honey."
Nat says: "Huh?"
Shubie says: "You're not using that tan accelerator again, are you?"
Nat says: "Oh, don't pretend you don't love it."
Craig says: "Good work, man!"
Craig says: "I see you've read my book."
Nat says: "Craig Mammalton?"
Shubie says: "The tannest man on TV?"
Sadie says: "Oh, look at those gorgeous wrinkles."
Craig says: "What, these?"
Nancy says: "Oh, and his skin, it's so leathery!"
Craig says: "Well, I don't mean to brag, but, uh..."
SpongeBob says: "Who's Craig Mammalton?"
Sandals says: "You don't know who Craig Mammalton is?"
Sandals says: "He's like, so tan!"
Sandals says: "Legend has it that his tan is so deep, that even his bones are a rich caramel brown!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
Patrick says: "Wow!"
Patrick says: "His mother must be so proud."
Craig says: "Please, people, please."
Craig says: "There'll be plenty of time to admire my body this weekend, at my annual summer shindig."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, Patrick, an invitation to our first summer shindig!"
SpongeBob says: "And here it is!"
Craig says: "Can I help you, little fella?"
SpongeBob says: "It seems to be stuck."
Craig says: "Yeah, I don't think this is your type of party."
Craig says: "I don't want to embarrass you guys..."
Craig says: "Hey, everyone, check this out!"
SpongeBob says: "Must be this tan to enter."
Craig says: "And your skin is as light and smooth as a, well, as a baby's bottom."
SpongeBob says: "Why, thank you."
Patrick says: "We did put on a few extra coats of sun screen today."
Patrick says: "We've gotta look our best."
Craig says: "You're not coming to my party, without a tan."
SpongeBob says: "There, now that we've turned your rock into a tanning bed, we're sure to get tan enough for the party!"
SpongeBob says: "Let's just test it out first to be sure."
Both says: "Hooray!"
Patrick says: "Me first!"
Patrick says: "Me first!"
SpongeBob says: "Ooh, Patrick, how do you feel?"
Patrick says: "Like one of those hip young old folks from a soda commercial."
Old Man says: "It's radical!"
SpongeBob says: "My turn!"
SpongeBob says: "Remember, Patrick, 15 seconds exactly."
Patrick says: "Gotcha, 15 seconds, give or take a few minutes."
SpongeBob says: "No, no, Patrick, 15 seconds exactly!"
SpongeBob says: "It's really important..."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Patrick says: "What?"
Patrick says: "Did somebody say something?"
Ladies says: "Hey, there!"
Sally says: "Is that tan for us?"
Patrick says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, Patrick, it's time for me to get out!"

Millie says: "Do you really have to go, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Afraid so."
Patrick says: "Bye, girls."
Ladies says: "Bye, Pat."
Nazz says: "Oh, he's so leathery."
SpongeBob says: "Well, Patrick, how do I look?"
Patrick says: "Oh, it's you."
Patrick says: "You don't look too good."
SpongeBob says: "What, what, what do you mean?"
Patrick says: "See for yourself."
SpongeBob says: "I must have been under the tanning machine too long!"
Patrick says: "Ew, what are you going to do?"
SpongeBob says: "I'll ask Squidward, he's always so helpful."
SpongeBob says: "He'll know what to do."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Squidward."
Squidward says: "What is it now, Sponge--- Ghost!"
Squidward says: "I'm sorry I was so mean to you while you were alive, please don't haunt me!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I'm not a ghost, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I used Patrick's tanning booth, and I stayed under too long."
Squidward says: "Sun Bleached!"
SpongeBob says: "Huh, now I'll never get into that party."
Patrick says: "Hey, that's quitter talk, mister!"
Patrick says: "You're going to that party tonight!"
Patrick says: "What you need, is a makeover!"
Patrick says: "What do you think?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh what a cute wittle baby."
SpongeBob says: "Cootchie-cootchie-coo."
Norma says: "Monster!"
Patrick says: "Well, hey, buddy, looks like you could use an ice cream."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah, that hit the spot."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I think you'll have to go to the party without me, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "There's just no way I can get that golden brown in time."
SpongeBob says: "But that's no reason you shouldn't go."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, why did you..."
Patrick says: "Can't talk, working."
SpongeBob says: "No, really, Patrick, what are you..."
SpongeBob says: "Ugh."
SpongeBob says: "I feel sticky."
Patrick says: "Take a look."
SpongeBob says: "Wooh!"
Craig says: "Nice job, Ma'am."
Craig says: "Join the party!"
Craig says: "Ahem, but the baby's going to have to wait outside."
Evelyn says: "But he's the perfect shade of Tropical Toddler."
Craig says: "Yes, but..."
Evelyn says: "Tyler!"
Evelyn says: "How could you?!"
Evelyn says: "!"
Craig says: "Now, don't worry, Ma'am, he can wait out here, with the other rejects."
Fish says: "Oh, no tears, son, we'll get in next year."
Craig says: "Next."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, no!"
SpongeBob says: "Caramel, hardening!"
SpongeBob says: "Gotta get out of here!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Patrick says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "Can I get a little help here?"
Patrick says: "Oh, sure thing, pal."
Patrick says: "Hey, everybody, make some room!"
Patrick says: "The floor's all yours!"
Patrick says: "Knock 'em dead, kid."
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick, I..."
Frankie says: "So bright!"

Craig says: "It's the ultimate tan."
Craig says: "He's..."

Narrator says: "Two hours later."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Do you think that maybe too much sun is a bad thing?"
Patrick says: "Whatever."
Patrick says: "I just go with the flow."
