TV narrator says: "We now return to tonight's Creepy Time Theater presentation of Night of the Robot."
SpongeBob says: "Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "What do you mean I shouldn't watch this?"
SpongeBob says: "Scary movies don't always freak me out."
Gary says: "Meow!"
SpongeBob says: "Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right?"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I've got nothing to worry about."
SpongeBob says: "And now to get a good night's sleep."
Mr. Krabs says: "How about a little music to count me money to?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, that's pretty catchy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Bee-bee-boo-bop, bee-bee-boo-beep."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, that's not bad."
Mr. Krabs says: "I love this young people's music."
SpongeBob says: "I surrender!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose?"
Squidward says: "I'm not wearing your hat on my nose!"
Squidward says: "I'm waiting for #17's order!"
SpongeBob says: "#17..."
SpongeBob says: "Krabby Patty and a medium beverage."
SpongeBob says: "Course."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today."
SpongeBob says: "I guess I'm a little bit jumpy."
SpongeBob says: "I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world."
SpongeBob says: "I even asked Gary if he was a robot!"
SpongeBob says: "Pretty funny, huh?"
Squidward says: "Hilarious."
Squidward says: "Just deliver the food."
SpongeBob says: "There you go!"
SpongeBob says: "Enjoy your..."
SpongeBob says: "Say, you're not a robot, are you?"
Thaddeus says: "No, I'm not."
SpongeBob says: "Well, keep your eyes peeled."
Mr. Krabs says: "I feel completely recharged!"
SpongeBob says: "That sounds like Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Come on, little buddy, play it again."
Mr. Krabs says: "Please?"
Mr. Krabs says: "One more time, for me."
SpongeBob says: "That was strange."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels "recharged."
SpongeBob says: ""..."
SpongeBob says: "a robot!"
SpongeBob says: "Nah."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes, hello."
Mr. Krabs says: "I was wondering if you could play that song again."
Radio DJ says: "Hmmm..."
Radio DJ says: "which one, man?"
Mr. Krabs says: "The one that goes "bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep."
Radio DJ says: "No, man."
Radio DJ says: "You're thinking of "bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-bop."
SpongeBob says: "Oh my gosh."
SpongeBob says: "Why was Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs making all those beeping sounds?"
SpongeBob says: "Could it be that he's..."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Squidward, it's terrible!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs..."
SpongeBob says: "talking to radio..."
SpongeBob says: "beeping sounds..."
SpongeBob says: "strange dancing..."
SpongeBob says: "robot!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm serious, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs is a robot."
SpongeBob says: "And I can prove it, too."
Squidward says: "How did you..."
Squidward says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor!"
SpongeBob says: "They couldn't laugh."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What is it, boy?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it."
Mr. Krabs says: "Is it true, Squidward?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Is it hilarious?"
Squidward says: "Umm..."
Squidward says: "yeah, sure."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, let's hear it, lad."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, here it goes!"
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, how'd it go Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Uhh, it went, umm, uhh, let's see, uhh..."
Squidward says: "why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why?"
Squidward says: "It was rated "Arr!"
Squidward says: ""  Arr!"
Squidward says: "Because it's..."
Squidward says: "about..."
Squidward says: "pirates."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm not paying you to do stand up, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now get back to work!"
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "a robot!"
Squidward says: "There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "He's obviously heard it before."
Squidward says: "The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie."
Squidward says: "Now why don't you..."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What is it, boy?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward's father never hugged him."
SpongeBob says: "Isn't that sad?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now get back to work!"
SpongeBob says: "Just like the robot in the movie."
SpongeBob says: "He couldn't cry either."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous."
Squidward says: "I'll have you know my father loved me very much!"
SpongeBob says: "That's the final test, Squidward; the love test."
SpongeBob says: "Robots can't love."
Squidward says: "No, wait, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What is it, SpongeBob?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get back to work, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "Aw, me radio died!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr..."
Squidward says: "Will you be quiet?"
Squidward says: "Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries."
Squidward says: "Okay, so tell me, does Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs look anything like that?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "I'll evacuate the customers, you call the navy!"
SpongeBob says: "Hello, Operator?"
SpongeBob says: "Get me the Navy!"
Operator says: "Hello, you've reached the Navy's automated phone service."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, the robots are running the Navy!"
Squidward says: "Not the Navy!"
Squidward says: "What do we do now?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry."
Mr. Krabs says: "Bee-boo-boo-boo-bee-bop, boo-boo-bop."
Squidward says: "We need to find out what that robot did with the real Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, but how?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot."
Squidward says: "They poop on the robot?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information."
Squidward says: "I never thought I'd say this, but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, hello, boys."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's the meaning of this?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Untie me this instant!"
Squidward says: "Shut up!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Sweet Davy Jones, what the heck is going on?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Squidward says: "I said "shut up!"
Squidward says: "," you bucket of bolts!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't take it!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, are you okay?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch!"
Squidward says: "No, that's not Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs."
Squidward says: "That's Robot Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah."
Squidward says: "And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know."
SpongeBob says: "Right."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, you got to ask him a question first."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah."
SpongeBob says: "What color is my underwear?"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, let me handle this."
Squidward says: "Where's Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs?"
Squidward says: "We can do this all night if you want."
Squidward says: "Where's Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Where's Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabs!"
Squidward says: "Where's Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I am Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I am!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I am!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I am!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I am!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I am!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I am!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I am!"
SpongeBob says: "This is one stubborn robot."
Mr. Krabs says: "You think I'm a robot?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Squidward says: "We don't think; we know."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's the silliest thing I ever heard!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I am Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabs!"
Squidward says: "He's not cracking."
Squidward says: "We'll never get it out of him this way."
SpongeBob says: "I got an idea."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, but I saw Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs talking with his radio before."
SpongeBob says: "He called it his "little buddy."
Squidward says: "Oh, really?"
Squidward says: "Put it on the table, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're gonna interrogate my blender?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're crazy."
Squidward says: "We're just gonna see what your "little buddy" knows."
Mr. Krabs says: "No, wait!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you going to do to me blender?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That cost me money!"
Squidward says: "Where's Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That cost me $24."
Mr. Krabs says: "95!"
SpongeBob says: "I guess it didn't know anything."
Squidward says: "Go get the toaster."
Mr. Krabs says: "No, not me toaster."
Mr. Krabs says: "That cost me $32."
Mr. Krabs says: "50!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Noooooooooooooooo!"
SpongeBob says: "This is the last robot, Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "No, not my cash register!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I raised it myself."
Mr. Krabs says: "I got it when it was just a little calculator."
Squidward says: "I thought you said robots can't cry."
SpongeBob says: "I also said they couldn't love."
Mr. Krabs says: "I loved it like it was me own."
SpongeBob says: "Uh, at least he's not laughing."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob uhh, how did that movie of yours end?"
SpongeBob says: "The movie?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "The ending was great!"
SpongeBob says: "Turns out there weren't any robots after all."
SpongeBob says: "It was just their..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
