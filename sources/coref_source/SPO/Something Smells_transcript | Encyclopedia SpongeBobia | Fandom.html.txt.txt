The exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple is shown. The scene zooms into the interior of the pineapple, SpongeBob's bed room. His alarm clock goes off. SpongeBob gets up, still in his underwear, puts his blanket on like a cape, and uses the wind of the alarm clock to "fly" at his big calendar. He lands on the 20th day, which is a Sunday.
SpongeBob says: "Wow, it's Sunday, Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "Guess what's for breakfast?"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Ready, Gary?"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Just one more thing!"
SpongeBob says: "Pea..."

SpongeBob says: "I'm confused."
Patrick says: "Yes, I am."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, everyone is running away from me."
SpongeBob says: "Watch."
SpongeBob says: "I just don't get it."
The stench goes toward Patrick, but bounces off him, as he has no nose.
Patrick says: "I don't either."
Patrick says: "Maybe it's the way you're dressed."
Both says: "Nah."
Patrick says: "Maybe it's your voice."
SpongeBob says: "Good one, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Well, maybe it's just because you're ugly."
SpongeBob says: "Ugly?"
SpongeBob says: "You gotta be kiddin' me.."
Patrick says: "Better try the reflection test."
Patrick says: "Ugly."
SpongeBob says: "Oh no!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't be ugly!"

Driver says: "My eyes!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm ugly..."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, can I borrow some bath beads?"
SpongeBob says: "Go."
SpongeBob says: "Run away like all the others."
SpongeBob says: "No one would want a friend as ugly as I am."
Patrick says: "Sure they would!"
Patrick says: "It makes them feel better about the way they look!"
Patrick says: "Maybe a story will cheer you up."
SpongeBob says: "That didn't help at all."
SpongeBob says: "How long?"
SpongeBob says: "How long have I been ugly, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "As long as I can remember."
Patrick says: "You poor ugly thing, you."
SpongeBob says: "Help me!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm so ashamed!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm spiraling!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm spiraling!"
SpongeBob says: "It's okay, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Spiraling, over."
Patrick says: "Just do what I do when I have problems."
Patrick says: "Say it."
SpongeBob says: "I can't."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, you're never going to feel better unless you get this thing off your chest."
SpongeBob says: "I know, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Say it."
Patrick says: "Say it."
SpongeBob says: "I'm ugly."
Patrick says: "You're ugly and what..."
Patrick says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Square?"
Patrick says: "No."
Patrick says: "Proud."
SpongeBob says: "I'm ugly and I'm proud."
Patrick says: "Good!"
Patrick says: "Say it louder."
SpongeBob says: "I'm ugly and I'm proud."
Patrick says: "Louder."
SpongeBob says: "I'm ugly and I'm proud."
Patrick says: "Louder!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm ugly and I'm proud!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm ugly and I'm proud!"
Squidward says: "Is that what he calls it?"
SpongeBob says: "That felt great!"

Patrick says: "People respect self esteem."
SpongeBob says: "Hi."
SpongeBob says: "I am very ugly."
SpongeBob says: "But you should enjoy the movie anyway."
SpongeBob says: "Excuse me, sir."
SpongeBob says: "I hope my horrible ugliness won't be a distraction to you."
Fred says: "Not at all, boy."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob?"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, what's wrong?"
Patrick says: "You look at it!"
SpongeBob says: "Hello."
The fish run off. Patrick points SpongeBob at a larger group of people.
Patrick says: "You look at it!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi."
The fish run off.
Patrick says: "Look at it!"
Patrick says: "Look at it!"
Patrick says: "Look at it!"
Patrick says: "I want all of you to look at it!"
Everybody screams in terror and they all run out of the theater in a panic. Patrick and SpongeBob are all alone in the theater.
SpongeBob says: "They all ran away, Patrick."
Patrick says: "I bet there's no line at the snack bar."
Patrick says: "Hello..."
Patrick says: "?"
Patrick says: "Hello..."
Patrick says: "?"
Patrick says: "They must be on break."
Patrick looks bummed out.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, wait, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "I just remembered."
SpongeBob says: "I've got some of my peanut-onion sundae we can share!"
The fume of it floats past Patrick, burning off his eyebrows.
Patrick says: "That looks great!"
Wobbles says: "Stay back!"
Patrick says: "My hands aren't that dirty..."
Patrick says: "Hey, you guys want to hear a bathroom joke?"
Patrick's breath reaches the fish and they make disgusted noises.
Clay says: "You tryin' to kill us?!"
Clay says: "!"
The fish walkout murmuring. Patrick looks in the mirror.
Patrick says: "Oh..."
Patrick says: "Oh!"
Patrick says: "I caught the ugly!"
SpongeBob walks in.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, is everything okay in here?"
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing in there, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Wouldn't you like to know?"
SpongeBob says: "And why is that bag on your head?"
Patrick says: "Why?"
Patrick says: "Oh, no reason."
Patrick says: "Except you gave me the ugly!"
Patrick says: "What am I gonna do?"
Patrick says: "I can't go out looking like this!"
SpongeBob says: "Just remember what we talked about."
SpongeBob says: "There's power in pride."
Patrick says: "That may be fine for you, but I was one of the beautiful people."
Patrick says: "Now look at me!"
Patrick says: "I'm almost as ugly as you!"
Patrick says: "I always thought if I was as ugly as that guy, I don't know what I'd do."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick..."
SpongeBob says: "?"
Patrick says: "What's my mom gonna say?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Oh my gosh, if my sister finds out, wait, I don't have a sister, if the bank, I mean it's one thing if you have bad shoes or even bad hair, but..."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Ahhhhhhhh, what a relief..."
SpongeBob says: "Arrgh, barnacles, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "What did you eat?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "Oh, some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza..."
SpongeBob says: "No, I mean just this morning."
Patrick says: "Some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza..."
SpongeBob says: "What else?"
Patrick says: "Well, I had some of your sundae."
SpongeBob says: "Sundae..."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "My sundae gave us rancid breath!"
Patrick says: "Whatcha mean?"
SpongeBob says: "I mean, we're not ugly, we just stink!"
Patrick says: "Stink?"
Both says: "We stink!"
Both says: "We stink!"
Both says: "We stink!"
Both says: "We stink!"
Both says: "We stink!"
Both says: "We stink!"
The fumes encompass the entire theater and it dissolves to the ground. SpongeBob and Patrick run out and run up to Squidward, who is looking through the window of a wig shop.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, guess what, Squidward?"
Both says: "We stink!"
