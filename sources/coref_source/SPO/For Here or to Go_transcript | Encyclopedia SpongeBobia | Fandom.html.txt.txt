Mr. Krabs says: "Unfortunately for Flankton,  The end."
Plankton says: "Oh, bravo."
Plankton says: "Bravo."
Plankton says: "Why does the puppet get to eat a Krabby Patty and I don't?"
Plankton says: "And why aren't you in the kitchen cooking my patty?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Alright, SpongeBob, we can't stall him any longer."
Mr. Krabs says: "Make a good one, laddie."
Mr. Krabs says: "This may be the last Patty you'll ever cook."
SpongeBob says: "I'll do my best, sir."

Mr. Krabs says: "You gotta swallow it here on the premises."
Plankton says: "Oh, come on."
Agent Twirp says: "I'll allow it."
Plankton says: "Fine!"
Plankton says: "Can I go now?"
Mr. Krabs picks up Plankton and throws him back to the Chum Bucket. He slides into the lab and gets on to a table.
Plankton says: "Karen, quick!"
Plankton says: "You gotta cut this Krabby Patty out of me, stat!"
Karen says: "But what about anesthetic?"
Plankton says: "There's no time!"
Plankton says: "I can feel it digesting!"
Karen lifts her arm revealing that there is a saw attachment.
Karen says: "Whatever you say, dear."
Karen says: "Hold still."

Plankton says: "Just guess how many customers I can fit into the Chum Bucket!"
Mr. Krabs gasps.
Abigail Marge says: "I feel terrible!"

Henry-Bart says: "Get it off!"
Henry-Bart says: "Get it off!"
All of the customers scream and run away.
Plankton says: "Wait, come back!"
Plankton says: "Oh, come on, Karen, what happened?"
Karen says: "I just did what you asked."
Karen says: "Krabby Patty."
Mr. Krabs laughs.
Mr. Krabs says: "It warms me heart to see that little twerp fail."
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, boyo, fun time's over."
Mr. Krabs says: "and put these seeds back on 'em."
