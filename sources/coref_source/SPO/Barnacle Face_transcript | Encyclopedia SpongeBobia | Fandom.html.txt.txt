The episode begins at Bikini Bottom High School. A teenage fish walking past gets a doughnut thrown on him in which two teenage fish laugh and then spits on his friend's face. Another teenage male fish with headphones attempts to say hi to the teenage female fish who pass him while chatting but they only remove them and put them on the floor and walk off. A teen bully fish does a wedgie to a teenage nerdy fish who screams but the nerdy fish twists his nipple really hard causing him to run off crying. While all this is happening, Pearl and her friend is sitting down on a bench talking.
Pearl says: "Boy, do I love high school."
Pearl says: "."
Pearl says: "You know what?"
Pearl says: "Someday we're gonna remember all this, and we're gonna look back and say..."
Pearl says: "Remember?"
Pearl's friend says: "Speaking of remembering, you didn't forget the Bikini Bottom High School Dance is tomorrow night, did you?"
Pearl says: "Of course I didn't forget."
Pearl says: "I'm so excited."
Pearl's friend says: "Me, too!"
They both laugh until Pearl's friend stops in shock.
Pearl's friend says: "Barnacle!"
Pearl says: "What!"
Pearl says: "?"
Pearl's friend says: "Pearl I'm gonna say this as touchily as possible."
Pearl's friend says: "There is a hideous barnacle growing out of the side of your face!"
Pearl says: "Where!"
Pearl says: "?"
Her friend moves her face so she can see it.
Pearl's friend says: "There!"
Pearl notices the barnacle growing and starts screaming. So much that the entire Bikini Bottom is looking at her.
Pearl's friend says: "Pearl, it's not really bad as you..."
She screams again. All of the high school students are looking at her again. Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab; SpongeBob appears to be whistling while mopping the floors.
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Didn't you already mop this area?"
SpongeBob says: "Affirmative, captain!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, then, why would you mop it again?"
SpongeBob says: "Why wouldn't I?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Good point."
Pearl enters the Krusty Krab in tears.
Mr. Krabs says: "Pearl, what brings you in on such a fine afternoon?"
Pearl says: "Oh, Daddy!"
Pearl says: "It's terrible."
Pearl says: "The school dance is this weekend."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oooh, that is terrible."
Mr. Krabs says: "Makes my shell crawl just thinking about it."
Mr. Krabs says: "Bleugh!"
Pearl says: "No, daddy!"
Pearl says: "Don't you understand?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Pearl says: "The terrible part is that I can't go to the dance!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why ever not?"
Pearl says: "Because I have a hideous barnacle growing on the side of my face!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh-ho-ho-ho."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, calm down there, my little Pearl."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm sure it can't be half as awful as you..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Great rusty hinges of Davy Jones' Locker!"
Pearl says: "We have to get rid of it, no matter what it takes!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Anything for me beloved angel!"
Pearl says: "Oh, okay."
Pearl says: "I need an appointment with a dermatologist, a trip to the spa, expensive creams and lotions, and probably some other kind of..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I meant whatever you need to get rid of your blemish, not liquidate me retirement fund!"
Harold says: "You know what?"
Harold says: "Let's go across the street to the Chum Bucket."
Nat says: "I heard they have better weather over there."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "How would you like to do your dear old chum a favor and rid his beautiful daughter of her evil barnacle?"
SpongeBob says: "I will do you this favor, sir chum, never fear!"
Pearl says: "I don't know, SpongeBob."
Pearl says: "The school dance is right around the corner, and this barnacle seems to be getting bigger by the minute!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't fear, Pearl."
SpongeBob says: "We'll get rid of this barnacle in no time!"
SpongeBob says: "I know just what to do!"
Pearl says: "Are you sure?"
SpongeBob says: "One time, my friend Patrick had this barnacle the size of an extra large Krabby Patty right at the center of his forehead!"
SpongeBob says: "Anyway, I fixed it so we never saw that barnacle again."
Pearl says: "How?"
SpongeBob says: "I took him to see a hypnotist."
Pearl says: "You took Patrick to a hypnotist?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "The barnacle."
SpongeBob says: "It became convinced it was a pelican and flew south for the winter."
SpongeBob says: "We never saw that pelican again."
Pearl says: "I thought you said it was a barnacle."
SpongeBob says: "What did I say?"
Pearl says: "Pelican."
SpongeBob says: "He was a really good hypnotist."
SpongeBob says: "Now just remain calm and it's all over before you know it."
Pearl says: "Are you really going to use hypnosis to get rid of the..."
Pearl says: "barnacle?"
Pearl says: "Is everything okay?"
Pearl says: "Did it come off?"
SpongeBob says: "Gettin' there."
Next, SpongeBob tries removing the barnacle with a jackhammer.
Pearl says: "SpongeBob, how much longer?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh..."
SpongeBob says: "shouldn't be too much longer."
SpongeBob says: "Personally, you could take a break off if you'd like."
Pearl says: "Good idea."
Pearl says: "I'm going to scrub my face with some soap and water."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
In the bathroom, Pearl is putting some soap on a towel and scrubbing it on her barnacle. She suddenly screams and SpongeBob hears it.
SpongeBob says: "Pearl, what happened?"
Pearl says: "There's more!"
SpongeBob says: "I mean, you're right."
SpongeBob says: "There's more."
Pearl says: "All I did was wash with soap and water!"
SpongeBob says: "Hmm..."
SpongeBob says: "Water and..."
SpongeBob says: "this soap?"
Pearl says: "Yes, but why?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I'm sorry, did you want a whiff?"
Pearl says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "More for me!"
SpongeBob says: "Something wrong, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "For a second there, I thought a towering, hideous, mind-boggling abomination was standing here, staring at me in my own living room!"
Mr. Krabs says: "But then I realized..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Me jewels!"
SpongeBob says: "Pearl?"
SpongeBob says: "Pearl, you've been in the bathroom crying for three hours now."
SpongeBob says: "You can't stay in there forever."
Pearl says: "I'm not going to the dance!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, I'm coming in!"
SpongeBob says: "Look at the bright side, Pearl."
SpongeBob says: "At least you can still play the piano."
Pearl says: "And what exactly would that do to me?"
SpongeBob says: "I have no idea."
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Pearl."
SpongeBob says: "I'll fix your problem!"
Pearl says: "How?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I'm sure if I'll think strong enough, something will pop up."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "Where do you keep your soap?"
Pearl says: "In the basement."
Pearl says: "Duh, where else?"
Torch in hand, SpongeBob is entering the darkened basement when he hears a strange noise.
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't just stand there, boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Come help me with this!"
Mr. Krabs says: "There we go."
Mr. Krabs says: "Sometimes it just gets a little stuck."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, what is this thing?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why, it's my old soap press!"
SpongeBob says: "Soap press?"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's right!"
Mr. Krabs says: "All the soap Pearl and I use comes from this machine."
Mr. Krabs says: "And the best part is, it runs on 100% pure leftover Krabby Patties!"
SpongeBob says: "Leftover Krabby Patties?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Fresh and invigorating!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Plus, it's absolutely free."
SpongeBob says: "Ohhhh, that explains why it smells so familiar!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know about this, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "If Pearl finds out that you..."
Pearl says: "I've been using soap made out of Krabby Patties?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabby Patty essence."
Pearl says: "That's grease!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Got to go, you kids have fun!"
Pearl says: "I'm never gonna be able to get these barnacles off!"
Pearl says: "My young life is ruined forever."
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Pearl."
SpongeBob says: "I said I'm not going to let Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs down, and I'm not going to."
SpongeBob says: "What do you think of that?"
SpongeBob says: "Wait a minute, Pearl, say that again!"
Pearl says: "Okay."
Pearl says: "The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, you can stop."
SpongeBob says: "I think I have an idea..."
Pearl says: "Are you done yet?"
SpongeBob says: "And, ta-da!"
SpongeBob says: "What do you think?"
Pearl says: "I don't know, SpongeBob - what would my friends say?"
SpongeBob says: "We shall see shortly."
Pearl says: "Are you sure?"
SpongeBob says: "Shh."
SpongeBob says: "Trust me."
Three of Pearl's friends, a green fish, a blue fish, and a pink-orange fish, enter the house.
Blue fish says: "Pearl, we're here to pick you up to the- wow!"
Blue fish says: "Pearl, you look amazing!"
Pearl says: "I do?"
Blue fish says: "Well, not amazing."
Blue fish says: "Sparkly and shiny and amazing!"
Pearl says: "Whee!"
Pearl says: "To the Bikini Bottom High School Dance!"
SpongeBob says: "You have a good time, carefree teens!"
Mr. Krabs says: "My jewels!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, my entire collection of precious jewels is gone!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Seen it?"
SpongeBob says: "Of course!"
SpongeBob says: "Pearl's wearing it to the Bikini Bottom High School Dance!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Help!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Police!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Thief!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Stop that whale!"
SpongeBob says: "I promised Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs I wouldn't let him down, and I have partially fulfilled that promise."
