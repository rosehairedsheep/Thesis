Narrator says: "The first day of spring in Bikini Bottom."
Narrator says: "The flowers are blooming, the rainbows are..."
Narrator says: "how you say?"
Narrator says: "Bowing."
Narrator says: "The jellyfish are buzzing,  and it's time for the traditional..."
SpongeBob says: "Spring cleaning!"
SpongeBob says: "Guess what time of year it is, Gary?"
Gary says: "Meow!"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for your help, Gare!"
Gary says: "Meow!"
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "How's your spring cleaning going?"
Patrick says: "It's Spring Cleaning Day?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "Why didn't anyone tell me?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick runs through his pile of junk to get a cotton swab.
Patrick says: "Found it!"
Patrick says: "Thanks for the reminder, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Whatcha got in your trash can?"
Patrick says: "Huh!"
Patrick says: "?"
Patrick says: "You're throwing this away!"
Patrick says: "?"
Patrick says: "The wrapper of the gum I gave you yesterday!"
Patrick says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah."
Patrick says: "Oh!"
Patrick says: "Some people just don't understand sentimental value."
Patrick says: "You're throwing away Pete!"
Patrick says: "?"
Patrick says: "Y-You can't part with a keepsake!"
Patrick says: "That's why you keep them, for Pete's sake!"
Patrick says: "Hmph!"
Patrick says: "Why, I'm disgusted!"
Patrick says: "It's time you re-evaluate your priorities."
SpongeBob says: "Hmm."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe Patrick is right."
SpongeBob says: "All of these things do hold precious memories."
SpongeBob says: "Plastic wrap is neat, huh, Gary?"
Gary says: "Meow!"
SpongeBob says: "Order up!"
SpongeBob says: "Careful with these ones, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "They're special."
Squidward says: "Oh, dear me."
Squidward says: "I know."
Squidward says: "I hope I never forget this moment."
SpongeBob says: "You're right."
SpongeBob says: "I'm going to need something to preserve the memory."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, perfect!"
SpongeBob says: "Ah, memories."
SpongeBob says: "Greasy memories."
SpongeBob says: "Whoo-wee!"
SpongeBob says: "Nothing like a hard day of work at the Krusty Krab, eh, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Whew!"
SpongeBob saves his work sweat.
Squidward says: "You're sentimental about your sweat?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, that's not all!"
SpongeBob says: "And I'm also very sentimental about these Krusty Krab keepsakes, so many memories!"
SpongeBob says: "Grill grease, gum from under the Krusty Krab tables, today's mop water, bendy straws, mayonnaise, a collection of freshly used ketchup packets, and these are today's order tickets written by my favorite fellow employee, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "See?"
SpongeBob says: "This one has your tentacle print on it!"
Squidward says: "Okay, this is getting creepy now."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, well, better get these precious memories home."
Squidward says: "Officially creeped out now."
Gary says: "Meow, meow, meow."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, nonsense, Gary, I'll find a place to put everything."
SpongeBob looks outside.
SpongeBob says: "Like the front yard!"
Squidward is sleeping and wakes up by the clock. Squidward gasps when he sees SpongeBob's junk. Squidward opens his door when all of SpongeBob's junk is in the way. Squidward knocks on SpongeBob's door.
SpongeBob says: "Who is it?"
Squidward says: "It's Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "How do I know it's you?"
Squidward says: "Open the door, nitwit!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hi, Squidward, can I help you?"
Squidward says: "You can certainly help..."
Squidward says: "Why are you wearing garbage?"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for noticing, Squidward, and may I say that's a very becoming dress you're wearing this morning."
Squidward says: "Dress?"
Squidward says: "It is not a dress, it's a nightshirt."
Squidward says: "If you don't get rid of this trash, I'm calling the sanitation police."
SpongeBob says: "Ah, not the sanitation police!"
SpongeBob says: "You don't understand, these things aren't junk!"
SpongeBob says: "They're my friends, like this little guy,  You will be missed."
Squidward says: "Touching."
Squidward says: "Still creepy, but touching."
Squidward says: "Time to make a phone call."
Cop 1 says: "Sanitation police!"
Cop 1 says: "This is a raid."
Cop 1 says: "Step away from the refuse."
Squidward says: "Thank goodness you're here, officer."
Cop says: "Is this your filthy home?"
Squidward says: "No, it's not my home!"
Squidward says: "It belongs to that filthy little dirtbag!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi!"
Cop 1 says: "Thanks for the information, citizen."
Cop 2 says: "Hmph, snitch."
Cop 1 says: "Do your duty, Sergeant."
Cop 1 says: "This residence is now comdemned."
SpongeBob says: "Condemned?"
SpongeBob says: "What does that mean?"
Cop 1 says: "Condemned means this house is unfit to live in."
Cop 1 says: "You'll have to vacate the home immediately."
SpongeBob says: "Vacate?"
SpongeBob says: "You mean I have to move?"
Cop 1 says: "Anything that is a threat to public health must be condemned."
Cop 1 says: "Sergeant."
Squidward says: "Thank you again, officers."
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Please don't condemn my house."
Squidward says: "Sorry, SpongeBob, the law is the law."
Squidward says: "We can't just pick and choose which ones we follow."
Cop 1 says: "I'll request a commendation for you."
Squidward says: "Really?"
Cop 1 says: "Right after we condemn your house!"
Squidward says: "My house?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Cop 1 says: "Yes!"
Cop 1 says: "It's as filthy as your neighbor's."
SpongeBob says: "But isn't there anything we can do?"
Cop 1 says: "You can evacuate the premises or throw away your junk."
SpongeBob says: "Throw them away?"
Cop 1 says: "Thank you for the attempt, ma'am."
Squidward says: "Ma'am?"
Squidward says: "It's a nightshirt!"
Squidward says: "This is all your fault!"
Squidward says: "You have to get rid of your junk right now!"
SpongeBob says: "I know."
Squidward says: "You really miss them?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "I'll be strong."
Squidward says: "Well, maybe you can take photos of all your junk..."
Squidward says: "uh, friends before you toss them away."
SpongeBob says: "That's a great idea, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Then years from now, I can look at the photos, and remember my..."
SpongeBob says: "remember my precious little babies!"
Squidward says: "Creepy."
Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Squidward, the latter with his hat on and the former holding it, as the garbage man takes the junk away. He elbows Squidward to get his attention, and then points to his head to remind him to take his hat off.
SpongeBob sniffles as the garbage man takes the last can of junk away and throws it into the truck. SpongeBob walks over to him, holding up some dollar bills.
SpongeBob says: "Your pay, my good man."
The garbage man takes the money and gets into the truck. SpongeBob sniffs again as the truck begins to drive back to the dump.
SpongeBob says: "Goodbye, little friends."
SpongeBob says: "Have fun at the dump!"
Squidward says: "Well, now that you completely ruined my day, once again, I'm going back to bed."
SpongeBob says: "Alright, nighty-night."
Squidward says: "Idiot."
Squidward says: "What the..."
Squidward says: "?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, why is my house filled with photos of your dumb junk?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I forgot to tell you, I took so many pictures I ran out of room in my house."
Patrick says: "Nice dress."
Squidward says: "It's a nightshirt!"
