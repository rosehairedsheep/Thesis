He blows out more Krabby Patties onto a nearby table and puts them all into the freezer, then rolls up the leftover meat into a top hat then puts it on.
Narrator says: "One wiener later..."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"

Mr. Krabs says: "Now I'm impressed!"
Frank says: "Hmm..."
Frank says: "I could've sworn that sign said "Open."

Mr. Krabs says: "Go on."
Frank says: "My!"
Frank says: "What an interesting shape!"
Frank says: "Are those for sale?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Would you like to buy one?"
Frank says: "Well, that would depend on the price."
Mr. Krabs says: "Would you pay the same as what a Krabby Patty costs?"
Frank says: "Hmm..."
Frank says: "sure, I suppose so!"
Mr. Krabs says: "How about double?"
Frank says: "Now you're talking!"
Customer says: "Krabby Patties again?"

Squidward says: "Excruciating."
Mr. Krabs says: "Up here, boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Take a look!"

Mr. Krabs says: "What on earth for?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Krusty Dogs was your best idea ever, boy!"
SpongeBob says: "I know."

SpongeBob says: "A Krabby Pattier time!"
