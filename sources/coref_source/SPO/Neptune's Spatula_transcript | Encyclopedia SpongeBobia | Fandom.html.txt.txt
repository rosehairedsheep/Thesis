SpongeBob Patrick are browsing through Fry Cook Museum making noises at every rare item they see.
SpongeBob says: "Behold the ultimate cooking utensil, the golden spatula!"
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob, look what it says here."
Patrick says: "Many have tried to pull the spatula from this ancient grease, but all have failed."
SpongeBob says: "Only a fry cook worthy of King Neptune himself can wield..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
Patrick says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "the golden spatula."
Patrick says: "the golden spatula."
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
Patrick says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, oh, oh, oh!"
SpongeBob says: "Take a picture of me and the spatula!"
Miss Shell says: "Excuse me, do you know where the menu section is?"
Patrick says: "Uh!"
SpongeBob says: "Menu section?"
SpongeBob says: "That's easy, it's over that way."
SpongeBob says: "Uh-oh."
Patrick says: "Rude."
Patrick says: "Hey, the light changed."
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, Patrick..."
King Neptune says: "Yes, yes, at last!"
King Neptune says: "Someone worthy of being the royal fry cook."
King Neptune says: "Who has freed the spatula from the grease?"
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, I did, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Neptune, sir."
SpongeBob says: "SpongeBob SquarePants."
King Neptune says: "A fine jest, boy."
King Neptune says: "You are but a lowly yellow sponge."
King Neptune says: "Ah!"
SpongeBob says: "But, but..."
King Neptune says: "A purveyor of foods."
King Neptune says: "Yes, you must be my new fry cook."
Hot Dog Vendor says: "Uhh, sorry, King Neptune."
Hot Dog Vendor says: "I don't make them."
Hot Dog Vendor says: "I just sell them."
King Neptune says: "Then who pulled out the spatula?"
King Neptune says: "You there, crustacean!"
Larry says: "Who, me?"
King Neptune says: "You have the physique of Atlas!"
Larry says: "Thanks, I work out."
King Neptune says: "Make poses with me!"
Larry says: "Okay!"
King Neptune says: "You pulled the spatula from the grease!"
Larry says: "Nope, that was SpongeBob."
SpongeBob smiles.
King Neptune says: "This joke has gone far enough!"
King Neptune says: "Where's my fry cook?"
King Neptune says: "Ha!"
King Neptune says: "This thing is unfit to even scrub the royal tail fin!"
King Neptune says: "And besides, it's not just enough to pull a spatula from a greasy griddle."
King Neptune says: "There are certain qualities that a royal fry cook must have."
SpongeBob says: "Like?"
King Neptune says: "The royal fry cook must be, you know, left-handed."
SpongeBob says: "Actually, I've got two."
King Neptune says: "Uhh, he has six..."
Patrick says: "He is the new royal fry cook and you..."
Patrick says: "Is it hot in here or what?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "You hurt my friend!"
SpongeBob says: "You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar!"
King Neptune says: "So, little one, you think you have what it takes to be my fry cook?"
King Neptune says: "I will prove your worthlessness."
King Neptune says: "You shall be tested with a challenge!"
Patrick says: "Ouch."
King Neptune says: "Your friend's arrogance will cost you dearly."
King Neptune says: "There will be two challenges."
King Neptune says: "Three challenges!"
Patrick says: "Three?"
King Neptune says: "Enough!"
Patrick says: "He'll settle for one."
King Neptune says: "There will be but one challenge."
King Neptune says: "You will face me in: The Ultimate Cook-Off!"
SpongeBob says: "I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend."
King Neptune says: "Ah, yes, the round one."
King Neptune says: "I shall restore him."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob?"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob?"
Patrick says: "Oh, there you are!"
SpongeBob says: "How you feeling?"
Patrick says: "Pretty good."
Patrick says: "Say, have you gotten taller?"
King Neptune says: "And now, see the fate that may lie ahead."
King Neptune says: "My beloved home of Atlantis."
King Neptune says: "A prize worthy of Apollo."
King Neptune says: "You will reside here in this glorious palace, cook only for me, and be a god!"
Patrick says: "Hey, that sounds pretty good."
King Neptune says: "But if you should not succeed, you must give up fry cooking forever!"
King Neptune says: "What do you say?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm ready."
King Neptune says: "Very well then."
King Neptune says: "To the Poseidome!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ultimate Cook-Off!"
SpongeBob says: "May the best man win."
Mr. Krabs says: "Go back to your corners and when the bell sounds, come out cooking!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Put it all on Neptune!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I should have never taken the challenge."
Patrick says: "Don't give up on your dream, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "People used to tell me: "Patrick, you'll never amount to anything."
Patrick says: "You'll always have your head in the clouds."
Patrick says: "" Well, just look at me now."
King Neptune makes his very quickly with help from sea creatures and his magic. SpongeBob takes his time going through each important step to make sure his patty comes out right. King Neptune summons large amounts of wheat from the ground and zaps them into buns.
King Neptune summons the vegetables, and summons the swordfish to slice them all. SpongeBob makes sure a tomato is perfectly aligned. He carefully slices the tomato with the golden spatula.
King Neptune zaps the patties, while SpongeBob rubs sticks to create a fire. King Neptune uses magic to flip hundreds of patties. SpongeBob patiently waits for the patty to cook above the campfire.
King Neptune uses magic to assemble the hundreds of burgers that appear like Krabby Patties. King Neptune laughs while the burgers rain down. SpongeBob puts ketchup on two pickles to apply faces on them. He applies a cheese "blanket," kisses a pickle.
SpongeBob says: "Once upon a time..."
King Neptune still laughs, while the burgers assemble in a square-based pyramid. SpongeBob puts the top bun on his one Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob says: "Perfect!"
King Neptune says: "I win!"
King Neptune says: "Ooh."
Audience says: "You can eat it all, come one!"
Audience says: "Chew it!"
Audience says: "Why don't you eat it?"
Audience says: "Try it!"
Audience says: "Eat it!"
Audience says: "Eat it!"
SpongeBob says: "So, uhh, what do you think?"
King Neptune says: "Yours is superior."
King Neptune says: "Therefore, I concede to you, SpongeBob SquarePants, you win."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "What's so funny?"
King Neptune says: "You, SpongeBob."
King Neptune says: "That repulsive thing in my palace?"
SpongeBob says: "You mean, Patrick can't come?"
King Neptune says: "No, of course not."
SpongeBob says: "And my friends?"
King Neptune says: "Ah, the only friend you need, dear boy, is the royal grill."
Patrick says: "It was nice knowing you, buddy!"
SpongeBob says: "I know, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I'll miss you, too."
Mr. Krabs says: "I lost me bet!"
King Neptune says: "Come, SpongeBob, grab your things!"
King Neptune says: "It's time to depart..."
SpongeBob says: "I..."
SpongeBob says: "I..."
SpongeBob says: "I don't wanna go!"
King Neptune says: "It's too late now."
King Neptune says: "I can't live without your burgers."
King Neptune says: "You're going to be a god and like it!"
King Neptune says: "Maybe we do have a problem."
Patrick says: "Good morning, Krusty Krew."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "What'll you have?"
SpongeBob says: "Can you excuse me?"
King Neptune says: "The accursed stove has burnt my finger."
King Neptune says: "Feel thine own wrath, stove!"
King Neptune says: "Haha!"
SpongeBob says: "What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee?"
