SpongeBob says: "Workin' at the Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "La, la, la, la!"
SpongeBob says: "Loo..."
SpongeBob says: "♪ Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, are you okay?"
Squidward says: "Hm?"
Squidward says: "Oh!"
Squidward says: "I couldn't be better!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "It happened again, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you talking about?"
SpongeBob says: "It's Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "What is it about the third Wednesday of every month that makes Squidward so happy?"
Mysterious man says: "Psst."
Mysterious man says: "Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Roger!"
Squidward says: "Is that you?"
Mysterious man says: "Tonight's the big night!"
A few hours pass. It is night now.
SpongeBob says: "These camouflage outfits should help us find out what Squidward's secret Wednesday secret is!"
The bus arrives at a strange, pyramid-shaped building. Squidward gets off the bus.
Squidward says: "Hello, Brother Roger."
Brother Roger says: "Come right in, Brother Squidward."
Squidward says: "Thank you."
Squidward says: "Ah."
Squidward says: "This almost makes the other three hundred and fifty-three days worth living for."
Lodge leader says: "For centuries, cephalapods have had but one nemesis."
Lodge leader says: "Let he among you who wishes to join the lodge face your greatest fear."
Lodge leader says: "Cantankerous Moray Eelius!"
Cantankerous Moray Eelius says: "Huh?"
Squidward says: "I'll never forget my initiation ceremony."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Way to go!"
Patrick says: "Way to go!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "Patrick!"
Squidward says: "Did you follow me here?"
Lodge leader says: "Brother Squidward!"
Lodge leader says: "For thousands of years, no outsiders have witnessed this sacred initiation!"
Lodge leader says: "You have desecrated the sanctity of this lodge!"
Squidward says: "But..."
Squidward says: "but, I.."
Squidward says: "I..."
Squidward says: "I..."
Squidward says: "I..."
Squidward says: "I can't believe it."
Squidward says: "They kicked me out of the Cephalopod Lodge."
SpongeBob says: "Do we get to join the lodge?"
Squidward says: "Were you dropped on your head when you were a baby?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh!"
SpongeBob says: "How did you know?"
Squidward says: "Psychic powers."
Squidward says: "Hey!"
Squidward says: "Where's Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Maybe he got to join the lodge!"
SpongeBob says: "Or..."
SpongeBob says: "maybe not."
SpongeBob says: "They didn't let you join either?"
Patrick says: "Nah."
Patrick says: "I found the institution had nothing of to offer me."
Patrick says: "I was stagnating."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, where's Squidward?"
Patrick says: "Hold on."
Patrick says: "Found Squidward."
Squidward says: "The last thing in my life I really enjoyed."
Squidward says: "And SpongeBob ruined it, too."
Patrick says: "Well, at least you still have the hat."
Squidward says: "Yeah."
Squidward says: "I do, don't I?"
Brother Roger says: "Eh, hem."
SpongeBob says: "You still have your robes."
Patrick says: "You still have your underwear."
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "You can look now."
SpongeBob says: "Don't you worry, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sure if Patrick and I just explain what happened, they're sure to let you back in."
Brother Roger says: "What is it?"
Brother Roger says: "Oh, it’s you two."
SpongeBob says: "We just came to explain that Squidward had no idea that we followed him to the lodge."
SpongeBob says: "So, it's not his fault."
Patrick says: "Yeah."
Patrick says: "Not his fault."
Brother Roger says: "Then whose fault was it?"
Patrick says: "Was it my fault?"
SpongeBob says: "No, it wasn't your fault, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Thanks, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "And it wasn't your fault either."
Brother Roger says: "Well, if it wasn't your fault, and it wasn't Squidward's fault, whose fault was it?"
Patrick says: "Uh..."
Patrick says: "maybe it's your fault."
Brother Roger says: "Squidward is never allowed in this lodge again!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "Are they letting me back in the lodge?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "You can't set foot in the lodge."
Patrick says: "Ever!"
Squidward says: "Oh."
Squidward says: "Now that you two have ruined the last good thing in my life,..."
Squidward says: "I think I'll go slam my head in the door."
Squidward says: "Repeatedly."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, wait!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry we got you kicked out of your lodge."
SpongeBob says: "Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?"
Squidward says: "No."
Squidward says: "Why didn't you just make up your own dumb club instead of ruining mine?"
SpongeBob says: "That's it!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "We'll make our own club!"
SpongeBob says: "And it'll be so much better than that dumb old Cephalop-olaphapa Lodge!"
SpongeBob says: "And you can be our leader!"
SpongeBob says: "How great does that sound, O Mighty One?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Wanna join our club, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Dog-pile on Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Aaahhhh!"
Squidward says: "."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, you're the lodge expert."
SpongeBob says: "What do we do first?"
Squidward says: "Say goodbye."
SpongeBob says: "Goodbye!"
Patrick says: "Goodbye!"
Squidward says: "Morons."
SpongeBob says: "So anyway, Squidward, I was thinking we should be working on our secret lodge initiation."
Patrick says: "Hey."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick and I have come up with a secret hand-shake."
Patrick says: "Secret!"
SpongeBob says: "Patty-cake, patty-cake, sailor man!"
Patrick says: "Patty-cake, patty-cake, sailor man!"
SpongeBob says: "Bake me a cake as fast..."
Patrick says: "Bake me a cake as fast..."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "That's not a secret hand-shake!"
Squidward says: "Everybody knows Patty-cake!"
SpongeBob says: "Not the way we do it."
Patrick says: "We don't use our pinkies."
Squidward says: "Out!"
Patrick says: "I don't think Squidward wants to join our lodge."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, sure he does."
SpongeBob says: "He just needs a little push."
Squidward says: "Oh, what now?"
Squidward says: "I'm coming!"
Squidward says: "What do you..."
Squidward says: "Great."
Squidward says: "Must be one of SpongeBob's pranks."
They arrive at Jellyfish Fields.
SpongeBob says: "Okay, we can let him out now."
Squidward says: "Are you insane?"
Squidward says: "You kidnapped me?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, we didn't kidnap you."
SpongeBob says: "We just brought you here for..."
Patrick says: "Initiation."
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "What kind of initiation?"
SpongeBob says: "A very special initiation."
Squidward says: "Oh, boy."
Squidward says: "Look at the time!"
Squidward says: "Gotta run."
SpongeBob says: "Would you care to go first, Brother Patrick?"
Patrick says: "After you, Brother SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Brother Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Brother SpongeBob."
The next morning, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are all back at home.
Squidward says: "What's this?"
Squidward says: "Can it be?"
Squidward says: "My lodge robes!"
Squidward says: "I'm back in the lodge!"
Squidward says: "I gotta try 'em on!"
Squidward says: "Huh?"
Squidward says: "This can't be right!"
Squidward says: "These aren't my cephalopod robes!"
SpongeBob says: "They sure aren't."
SpongeBob says: "They're your uniform for your new lodge!"
SpongeBob says: "Welcome to the first official meeting of..."
SpongeBob says: "The Feather Friends."
Squidward says: "Feather Friends?"
SpongeBob says: "Somebody already had Feather Buddies."
Patrick says: "Yeah."
Patrick says: "Those Feather Buddies better hope they don't run into us in a dark alley."
Squidward says: "Grrrr."
Squidward says: "I don't want to be a Feather Buddy!"
SpongeBob says: "Do you still wanna be a Feather Friend?"
Squidward says: "Grrr..."
Squidward says: "no."
SpongeBob says: "Aw..."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, I hadn't realized how special your lodge was to you."
SpongeBob says: "I'll get you back in that club."
SpongeBob says: "And I know just how to do it."
Squidward says: "A sock?"
SpongeBob says: "Not just a sock..."
SpongeBob says: "a disguise."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick and I will climb inside the sock and pretend to be a giant albino eel."
SpongeBob says: "We will then gain entrance to the lodge, and frighten everyone inside."
SpongeBob says: "Once they're good and terrified, you, Squidward, will storm in, defeat that giant eel, and rescue all the lodge members."
SpongeBob says: "You'll be a hero, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "They'll have to let you back in the lodge!"
Patrick says: "Hm."
Patrick says: "It's genius."
Patrick says: "But, I see one flaw in your plan."
Squidward says: "One flaw?"
Patrick says: "That sock is way too small."
SpongeBob says: "It is."
SpongeBob says: "Time to break out the heavy artillery."
Patrick says: "That's what I'm talkin' about!"
It is night time at the Cephalopod Lodge.
Albino eel says: "Okay, Squidward."
Albino eel says: "Just give us five minutes and then do your stuff."
Squidward says: "Huh."
Narrator says: "5 minutes later..."
Squidward says: "This is ridiculous, No one is dumb enough to believe SpongeBob and Patrick are a.."
Squidward says: "a..."
Squidward says: "."
Squidward says: "giant albino eel!"
Patrick says: "Roooo!"
SpongeBob says: "Roar!"
Patrick says: "Roo!"
SpongeBob says: "Roar!"
Squidward says: "Unbelievable."
Lodge member says: "Squidward!"
Brother Roger says: "Look out!"
Lodge member says: "There's a giant albino eel on the loose!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
Patrick says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, ow!"
Patrick says: "Oh, ow!"
SpongeBob says: "Ow!"
Patrick says: "Ow!"
SpongeBob says: "Oof!"
Patrick says: "Oof!"
Lodge members says: "Squidward!"
Lodge members says: "Squidward!"
Lodge members says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Way to go, Squidward."
Patrick says: "It works!"
Squidward says: "Whoa!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "We still have the Feather Friends."
Patrick says: "But you'll have to pass the initiation again."
Squidward says: "Aaah!"
Squidward says: "No!"
Patrick grabs Squidward's tongue, so Squidward faces the screen. The screen then fades to black, and we can hear a sting. Squidward screams really loud.
