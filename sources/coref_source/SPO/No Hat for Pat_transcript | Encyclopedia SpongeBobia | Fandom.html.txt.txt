SpongeBob is trying to open the door, but Patrick is sleeping outside and blocking his door. SpongeBob tries to push the door, he opens the door slightly, looks at Patrick.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob closes the door, Patrick's head falls down, which makes him wake up.
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing out here, silly?"
Patrick says: "I'm waiting for you, so we can play the day away!"
Patrick says: "Oh, barnacles!"
Patrick says: "You're wearing that dumb hat, again!"
Patrick says: "Every time you wear that stupid thing, you're, you're gone for the whole day!"
SpongeBob says: "That's because this is my work hat, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I have to wear it when I go to work."
Patrick says: "Why don't you just take it off so you don't have to go to work today?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm afraid it doesn't work that way, buddy."
Patrick says: "Ugh!"
Patrick says: "I hate that hat!"
Patrick says: "Hmph."
Patrick says: "Looks like Squidward has time to play."
Patrick says: "Hey, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "What?"
Patrick says: "Oh no!"
Patrick says: "He's got the hat, too!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I'll be back from work at six."
SpongeBob says: "We can play then."
Patrick says: "I'll show you, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "I'll get a job and a hat!"
Cuts to the Krusty Krab, where a kid is adding ketchup to his fries.
Mr. Krabs says: "Whoa, whoa, that's enough, lad!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What do ya think, I'm made of ketchup?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now run along, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you doing there, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Standin' around out here all day."
Mr. Krabs gets an idea.
Mr. Krabs says: "How would you like a job, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Oh boy, gimme my hat!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You'll get your hat, but first you have to entice people into the restaurant by standin' right here and holdin' this sign."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's not too tough for ya, is it, boy?"
Patrick says: "Sounds complicated, but if it gets me a work hat."
Patrick says: "How's this?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Perfect."
Mr. Krabs says: "You'll be wearin' that hat in no time at all."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hee hee hee."
SpongeBob says: "What's shakin', Mr."
SpongeBob says: "K?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Your buddy, Patrick."
Mr. Krabs says: "I hired him to stand out there and hold that sign."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, he is good."
Mr. Krabs says: "And look."
Mr. Krabs says: "He's about reel in his first customer."
Harold says: "Can you direct me to the Krusty Krab please?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What does he think he's doing?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Patrick, you need to get their attention, boy."
Patrick says: "Okay."
Mr. Krabs says: "That ain't the kind of attention we need!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why don't you show a little razzle-dazzle, maybe give the sign a little twirl or something?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Just keep workin' on that one, eh, boy?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Listen, if any tourists come by, why don't you blow them away with a little extra twirl?"
Patrick says: "Anything for my new hat."
Patrick sees tourists approaching, so he spins the sign very fast. The wind is so intense that a window opens, and a tourist's camera gets blown away.
Mr. Krabs says: "That's enough, Patrick!"
Mr. Krabs and the tourists get blown away.
Patrick says: "I did it!"
Patrick says: "Did you see that, Mr."
Patrick says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I saw it."
Patrick says: "Do I get my hat now?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What the heck."
Mr. Krabs says: "It pays to advertise."
Patrick says: "My hat..."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, what's wrong with him?"
SpongeBob says: "What's the matter, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "I dunno."
Patrick says: "Sometimes, when I'm nervous, I forget how to stand."
SpongeBob says: "He's nervous."
Blue Fish says: "Ha ha ha!"
Blue Fish says: "Look at that guy!"
Blue Fish says: "He doesn't know how stand on his own two feet!"
Pink Fish says: "Now that's that kind of mindlessness I'd pay money to see!"
Mr. Krabs looks at them, then neck stretches out over to them.
Mr. Krabs says: "You mean, cash money?"
Pink Fish says: "Well, heck, yeah!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Five dollars please."
Mr. Krabs says: "All right!"
Mr. Krabs says: "There's that sound again!"
Mr. Krabs says: "They're loving it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Patrick, you've captured the attention of all these tourists with your ridiculous flapdoodle!"
Patrick says: "I did?"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's right, I think we've finally found a job you're good at."
Mr. Krabs says: "Being an absolute buffoon!"
Mr. Krabs says: "If it's folly you crave, it can be found exclusively at the Krusty Krab!"
Mr. Krabs says: "For just five dollars a head."
Bubble transition. Patrick falls and everybody is laughing and cheering.
Squidward says: "It's official."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick."
Patrick says: "Yeah?"
SpongeBob says: "Are you okay?"
Patrick says: "I'm fine."
Pink fish says: "Oh, that horrible noise!"
Pink fish says: "Let's get out of here!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What the barnacles is going on out here?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Squidward says: "I'm entertaining these heathens."
Mr. Krabs says: "We've got all the entertainment we need, thank you very much!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Where'd he go?"
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Easy now."
SpongeBob says: "Right this way."
Mr. Krabs says: "What in the name of Neptune is going on here?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick had a bloody nose, so I was going to walk him home."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, a bloody nose, eh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You think I was born yesterday?"
Mr. Krabs says: "He doesn't even have a nose."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now get back to work, the all of ya's!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm not running a happy factory here!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Keep up the good work, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "You got it, Mr."
Patrick says: "K!"
French Narrator says: "7 hours later..."
Patrick is still falling and three customers are watching as Billy passes by.
Billy says: "That guy still flopping?"
Customer says: "Yeah!"
Customer says: "Amazing, isn't it?"
Billy says: "Doesn't that get old?"
Customer says: "He's got a point."
Customer says: "Let's get out of here."
Billy says: "Me, too."
Billy says: "I'm out."
Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't go!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why ya leaving?"
Harold says: "This guy's act is stale!"
Harold says: "We crave excitement!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, okay!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You want excitement?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, what if I added a box?"
Billy says: "Sort of the same, really."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, okay, so what if he flopped from two boxes..."
Mr. Krabs says: "?"
Patrick says: "I like pie."
Billy says: "That, I'd pay to see!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, boy, let 'er rip!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll be in the back counting me money."
Mr. Krabs says: "If the crowd gets bored, add some more boxes!"
Squidward says: "Whatever."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, hat man..."
SpongeBob says: "How are you feeling after your first day on the job?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, are you all right?"
SpongeBob says: "Say something!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, that's it!"
SpongeBob says: "No best friend of mine is gonna suffer permanent brain trauma just so Mr Krabs can make a quick buck!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, buddy, I understand."
SpongeBob says: "Just promise me one thing."
Patrick says: "What's that, pal?"
SpongeBob says: "Just be careful."
Patrick says: "Thanks, pal."
Cut to SpongeBob walking to work. Seeing a neon sign saying "Featuring Pat! Ouch!".
SpongeBob says: "I'm worried about Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I'm not sure his new job is good for him."
Mr. Krabs says: "See the part time minimum wage employee fall from high atop this tower into this bucket of spiny sea urchins!"
Sandals says: "This should be good."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Hi, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, you can't let him do this, he might get hurt!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's okay, boy, he signed a waiver."
Mr. Krabs says: "Is he ready, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Ready!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Step back, boy, you wouldn’t want to stain your uniform."
Patrick says: "Hey, good idea."
Patrick says: "Squidward, could you hold me hat so it won't get hurt?"
Patrick says: "Thanks, buddy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ready, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Ready!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I can't watch!"
Harold says: "Hey, ew!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Come on, Patrick!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We've got a perfectly good bucket of spiny sea urchins down here!"
Patrick says: "I'm trying!"
Patrick says: "Argh, I think I'm stuck!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Stuck?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, if that don't …  What's the holdup, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Don't look at me, I'm just here to hold his hat."
Mr. Krabs says: "Patrick, why have you stopped falling?"
Patrick says: "I dunno, Mr."
Patrick says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, you'd better figure it out!"
Mr. Krabs says: "These people paid good money for a floor show full of pain and humiliation!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now make with the codswallop, pal, understand?"
Patrick says: "Uh-huh."
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't make me come back here."
Squidward says: "You want me to push you off your precarious perch into a bucket of spiny sea urchins?"
Squidward says: "Oh, if only you were SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Okay, I'll do it!"
Patrick says: "Thanks, Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Oh, my hat!"
Patrick says: "Gotcha!"
Patrick says: "All right, back where you belong, aaaah!"
Patrick says: "."
Harold says: "Great, we get to see two for the price of one!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't think so."
Harold says: "Fine."
Mr. Krabs says: "Thank you."
Patrick says: "Look, Squidward, I'm falling!"
Squidward says: "Oh, I'm so happy for you!"
Patrick says: "I figured it out; it's the hat that makes me fall, it makes me top heavy!"
They crash into the urchin bucket.
SpongeBob says: "So it was your hat that was making you fall the whole time!"
Nat says: "I paid to see two guys get maimed!"
Harold says: "Yeah, I want a refund!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Sorry, absolutely no refunds."
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, you leave me no choice!"
Patrick says: "You're giving me a raise?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Not even close."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're fired."
Mr. Krabs says: "As long as I'm still standing, you’ll never wear this hat again."
Patrick sobs with his hands covering his eyes.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you okay?"
Patrick says: "Well, I guess it's back to being to No Hat Pat!"
Narrator says: "Epilogue."
SpongeBob says: "It's okay, Patrick, not everyone is equipped to bear the awesome weight of responsibility that a uniform hat represents."
SpongeBob says: "But you can wear mine any time you want."
Patrick says: "Really?"
SpongeBob says: "Sure thing, pal."
Patrick says: "Thanks, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "You're the best!"
SpongeBob says: "Anytime, pal!"
SpongeBob says: "Anytime!"
