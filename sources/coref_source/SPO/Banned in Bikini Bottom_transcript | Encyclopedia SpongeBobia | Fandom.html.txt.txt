Episode begins at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is cooking Krabby Patties, and hears them sizzle. A big puff of steam comes up. SpongeBob sniffs it in, exhales with content and in the shape of a heart, then kisses it.
SpongeBob says: "I know I've said this 90 times already but..."
SpongeBob says: "♪I love Krabby Patties I think that they are swell."
SpongeBob says: "They are the best, there's no contest, and now I'm going to yell..."
SpongeBob says: "♪ Whoo!"
SpongeBob says: "♪I love Krabby Patties!"
SpongeBob says: "I think they're swell."
SpongeBob says: "They're so neat, and quite a treat, and how I love the way they smell..."
SpongeBob says: "La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la."
Squidward says: "I knew I shouldn't have gotten out of bed today."
SpongeBob says: "♪La la la la laaaaaaa..."
SpongeBob says: "la la la la!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hello, and welcome one, and all your money to ye olde Krusty Krabbie!"
Ms. Priss says: "Come along, sisters."
Ms. Priss says: "Pay no mind to this crimson abomination!"
Ms. Priss says: "Greetings."
Ms. Priss says: "Although your establishment seems repugnant and foul in nature, it seems not to offend our sensitivities."
Ms. Priss says: "It is for that reason, plus the fact that we have been stuck on a tour bus for several days, that my sisters and I would like to eat something here."
Squidward says: "Okay."
Squidward says: "But first, let me call the mortician and tell him his uniform's been stolen."
Squidward says: "Clothing zinger!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "These wretched hags-I mean, these little lovely ladies-are obviously here to eat."
Mr. Krabs says: "So let's sell 'em- I mean, serve them some delicious Krabby Patties!"
Ms. Priss says: "Well, Mr..."
Ms. Priss says: "um..."
Ms. Priss says: "Mr."
Ms. Priss says: "Krabs, you know the basic rules of behaving like a civilized bottom feeder."
Ms. Priss says: "Perhaps your restaurant isn't quite the hive of degenerates it appears to be, and we had you figured all wrong."
Mr. Krabs says: "'Course ya did, because you're about to find out."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "La la la la la la la la laaaaaaaa!"
Ms. Priss says: "Young man, what has caused you to act like this?"
Ms. Priss says: "I must know!"
SpongeBob says: "Actually, ma'am,  it was the absolute fun and deliciousness of a Krabby Patty."
Ms. Priss says: "Krabby Patty?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, that's right."
Ms. Priss says: "Well, anything this fun and delicious can't be good."
Ms. Priss says: "Why, what would this world be if everyone cavorted it in such a manner?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Who are you with your tight lips, raised eyebrows, and conservative clothes?"
Ms. Priss says: "I am Ms."
Ms. Priss says: "Gristlepuss."
Ms. Priss says: "We are The United Organization Of Fish Against Things That Are Fun And Delicious."
Ms. Priss says: "Or, T."
Ms. Priss says: "U."
Ms. Priss says: "O."
Ms. Priss says: "O."
Ms. Priss says: "F."
Ms. Priss says: "A."
Ms. Priss says: "T."
Ms. Priss says: "T."
Ms. Priss says: "A."
Ms. Priss says: "F."
Ms. Priss says: "A."
Ms. Priss says: "D."
Ms. Priss says: "for short."
Ms. Priss says: "And we are going to ban these so called "Krabby Patties", and close your restaurant forever!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What the..."
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Ms."
SpongeBob says: "Gristlepuss, maybe if you were to taste the Krabby Patty for yourself, you too could experience the awesome pleasure."
Ms. Priss says: "I would soon as sprout legs and do the Watusi!"
SpongeBob says: "Ooh!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ah, it don't matter anyway, lad."
Mr. Krabs says: "She can't close us down."
Mr. Krabs says: "How did it come to this?"
Squidward says: "You called Ms."
Squidward says: "Gristlepuss a disgusting old prune, then you threatened her with a french-fry strainer."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, I didn't know her husband was the chief of police!"
Cut to behind SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs, where Priss and 4 look-alikes stand in front of a muscular police officer going into a police car.
Ms. Priss says: "Thanks again, Al."
Al says: "Any time, honey."
Al says: "See you at home for dinner."
Al says: "Mmm!"
Al says: "Yee-haw!"
Ms. Priss says: "I just love that man."
Cut back to Mr. Krabs tugging at the lock on the Krusty Krab teary-eyed, then to SpongeBob and Squidward sitting.
Squidward says: "How long has he been standing over there?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, 4 days."
Mr. Krabs walks over.
Mr. Krabs says: "It's no use!"
SpongeBob says: "You know, it's too bad."
SpongeBob says: "The only way to make Krabby Patties again would be if you opened a place that didn't look like a restaurant and did it secretly."
Mr. Krabs says: "And I know just where to open it."
Cut to SpongeBob's pineapple house, where Squidward is painting a banner that says "Grand Opening! The SECRET Krusty Krab!". Cut to inside the house. Mr. Krabs is dusting the cash register.
Mr. Krabs says: "There ya are, Betsy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Good as new!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Whoa, sorry."
Mr. Krabs says: "You know, lad, I can remember a time when people used to knock before entering someone else's home!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, but..."
SpongeBob says: "this is my home."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, yeah..."
Patrick walks in.
Patrick says: "Hey guys!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for helping out today!"
Patrick says: "You bet!"
Patrick says: "Where do you want these extra buns?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, that bag is totally empty."
Patrick then lets out a big burp.
Patrick says: "Oops."
Cut to a telescope sighting of the Krusty Krab sign, with a plank on it that says "Closed", then to Plankton with a small telescope in hand.
Plankton says: "Happy day, Karen!"
Plankton says: "That fool Krabs changed the name of his restaurant to the closed Krab!"
Plankton says: "Everyone will think it's closed, and come eat here instead!"
Plankton says: "He'll be ruined by tomorrow!"
Plankton says: "What an idiot!"
Karen says: "It is closed."
Plankton says: "What?"
Karen says: "Ms."
Karen says: "Gristlepuss and her husband banned Krabby Patties for being fun and delicious."
Plankton says: "Banned?"
Plankton says: "Then that means, my day of reckoning has come at last!"
Plankton says: "I won, I tell you!"
Plankton says: "I've won!"
Plankton says: "And what better way than by default?"
Karen says: "Where are you going?"
Plankton says: "Oh, out to celebrate."
Harold says: "Quit shoving."
Nat says: "I wasn't shoving."
Nat says: "I was going like that and you happened to be standing there."
Harold says: "That's called shoving."
Nat says: "No, it isn't."
Harold says: "Yes, it is."
Nat says: "Nope."
Harold says: "Yes!"
Nat says: "Nope!"
Plankton says: "Excuse me, gents!"
Plankton says: "But what's with all the hullabaloo?"
Harold says: "We're just waiting in line to buy a Krabby Patty."
Plankton says: "Krabby Patty?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Patrick says: "What's the password, please?"
Plankton says: "What are you talking about, you gargantuan buffoon?"
Patrick says: "That's it!"
Patrick says: "Come right in!"
Plankton says: "Curse you!"
Gary says: "Meow."
Squidward says: "So, would you like to secret-size that for two dollars more?"
Customer says: "Of course!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, Squidwart."
Mr. Krabs says: "You haven't seen any sign of..."
Mr. Krabs says: "you know..."
Mr. Krabs says: "the cops!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Have ya?"
Squidward says: "Did you just call me "Squidwart"?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, thanks."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm gonna see what SpongeBob's doing."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you doing under the table?"
SpongeBob says: "If Krabby Patties are illegal now, aren't we breaking the law?"
Mr. Krabs says: "There's an old saying, lad."
Mr. Krabs says: "What doesn't kill ya..."
Mr. Krabs says: "usually succeeds in the second attempt."
SpongeBob says: "But what does that have to do with making Krabby Patties?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Nothing!"
Mr. Krabs says: "But if don't get out there and start cooking, I'll make ya start taking weekends off!"
SpongeBob says: "Nooooooo!"
Plankton says: "So, Mr."
Plankton says: "Krabs is operating under the table, huh?"
Plankton says: "Well, two can play at that game!"
Al says: "Hello, this is officer Al, chief of police."
Plankton says: "Cops, I need you!"
Patrick says: "Nope, that's not it!"
Miss Priss says: "You missed one!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, Ms."
Mr. Krabs says: "Gristlepuss!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm sorry we sold Krabby Patties."
Mr. Krabs says: "But do you really have to send us to jail?"
Miss Priss says: "Of course I do!"
Miss Priss says: "You are a nuisance to my community!"
Al says: "You tell him, honey!"
Al says: "Ha!"
Al says: "That's my girl!"
Miss Priss says: "Al!"
Miss Priss says: "What are you doing!"
Miss Priss says: "?"
Al says: "Having some lunch."
Miss Priss says: "Unhand that sandwich at once!"
SpongeBob says: "Ms."
SpongeBob says: "Gristlepuss!"
SpongeBob says: "Look out!"
Miss Priss says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "Your shoe's untied!"
Miss Priss says: "It is?"
Miss Priss says: "Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh ♪Aaaaaaahhhhhh!"
Miss Priss says: "♪  ♪I like Krabby Patties!"
Miss Priss says: "I think they're swell."
Miss Priss says: "Can you not tell?"
Miss Priss says: "Krabby Patties, Krabby Patties, they're so neat!"
Miss Priss says: "♪Sweet to eat!"
SpongeBob says: "♪Treat that's neat!"
Miss Priss says: "♪dismount!"
SpongeBob says: "♪dismount!"
Miss Priss says: "That was wonderful!"
Miss Priss says: "I..."
Miss Priss says: "I feel..."
Miss Priss says: "reborn!"
SpongeBob says: "Does that mean you're not sending us to the slammer?"
Miss Priss says: "Of course, my dear boy."
Miss Priss says: "I'm a kinder, gentler fish."
Miss Priss says: "And I owe it all to you."
SpongeBob says: "Don't forget the spatula!"
Miss Priss says: "Don't push it, Al."
Miss Priss says: "Well, I think I'll have another one."
Plankton says: "Oh dear."
