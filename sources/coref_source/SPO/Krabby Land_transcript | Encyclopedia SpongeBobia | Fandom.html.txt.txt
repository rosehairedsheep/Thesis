SpongeBob says: "Ah, I don't know how you do it, Gare Bear, but that's the best cup of French toast I've ever had."
Gary says: "Meow."
Squidward says: "I'm not much of a summer person, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "Davy Jones on the jib!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Do my ears deceive me?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Is it really the first day of summer?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Is it?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
SpongeBob says: "What is it about summertime that makes us so happy?"
SpongeBob says: "The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop?"
Mr. Krabs says: "The money!"
SpongeBob says: "The money?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Er, uh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I mean, uh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "the children!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh."
Mr. Krabs says: "You see, boy, during the summer, the children are excused from their classes, a recess commonly referred to as summer break."
SpongeBob says: "Tell me more about summer break."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, during this summer break, the children wander Bikini Bottom unsupervised, their pockets lined with allowance."
Mr. Krabs says: "Come here, you little piggies!"
SpongeBob says: "I've been taught the true meaning of summer."
Narrator says: "Later..."
SpongeBob says: "Almost closing time, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "K."
Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "But that's impossible."
Mr. Krabs says: "What about the money?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I mean uh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "uh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "what about the children?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I guess summer isn't coming this year."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there."
Mr. Krabs says: "Playground?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Luring away me young customers?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Warm up the boat, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "See anything, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, they're here, all right."
Mr. Krabs says: "Just look at them, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "No!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I've got nothing to live for, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool."
Mr. Krabs says: "True."
Mr. Krabs says: "But that's not gonna get these munchkins away from this playground."
Mr. Krabs says: "Unless..."
Mr. Krabs says: "hmmm..."
Mr. Krabs says: "see you tomorrow, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Got a lot of work to do."
SpongeBob says: "You got it, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs..."

Mr. Krabs says: "All right, here we go!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I give you..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabby Land!"
Kids says: "Yeah!"
Tyler says: "Whoa!"
Tyler says: "Ooh, where am I?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Eh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "that reminds me."
Mr. Krabs says: "I forgot to give you these coloring books/liability waivers!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Everyone who hands theirs back gets to meet the one and only Krabby the Clown!"
Kids says: "Yay!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Have fun and don't forget to eat plenty of vitamin-enriched Krabby Patties."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabby the Clown's favorite meal."
Kids says: "We want Krabby!"

Mr. Krabs says: "He'll be here after I count their money."
Mr. Krabs says: "Just stall 'em."
SpongeBob says: "Stall 'em?"
SpongeBob says: "How do I do that?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't know."
Mr. Krabs says: "Be entertaining."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, kids!"
Monroe says: "You're not Krabby the Clown."
SpongeBob says: "No, I'm not."
SpongeBob says: "I'm, uh..."
SpongeBob says: "I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty.."
SpongeBob says: "Umm..."
SpongeBob says: "Burglar!"
Tyler says: "Lame."
SpongeBob says: "Krabby will be here soon."
SpongeBob says: "He, uh, had to take the bus."
SpongeBob says: "But in the meantime, let's have some fun!"
SpongeBob says: "You kids like bubbles?"
Monroe says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Well, you've never seen my bubbles."
SpongeBob says: "Voila!"
SpongeBob says: "A bubble shaped like a jellyfish."
SpongeBob says: "How 'bout that?"
Tyler says: "Still lame."
SpongeBob says: "Uh..."
SpongeBob says: "huh."
Kids says: "You stink!"
Kids says: "Bring on the clown!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, uh..."
SpongeBob says: "and now for a finale!"
Kids says: "Boo!"
Kids says: "Boo!"
Kids says: "Boo!"
Kids says: "Boo!"

SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "I can't take any more of this stalling stuff."
Mr. Krabs says: "Always thinking about yourself."
Mr. Krabs says: "Get out there and stall!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What happened to your arms and legs, boy?"
SpongeBob says: "The kids are using them as..."
SpongeBob says: "boomerangs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Boomerangs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh no!"
Mr. Krabs says: "They might break my windows!"
SpongeBob says: "What are we gonna do?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, now that all their money's counted, tell them Krabby has just arrived!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, boy!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh boy!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh boy!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh boy!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get out there and tell 'em!"

Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "How could you, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "You promised these children Krabby the Clown, but all I saw out there was..."
SpongeBob says: "Cheapy the Cheapskate!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, I ain't cheap!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now take this tomato back to the kitchen before it spoils."
SpongeBob says: "But what about the true meaning of summer?"
SpongeBob says: "What about the children?"
Kid says: "Ahem."
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uncle Krabs has to go to the bank now."
Mr. Krabs says: "Heh."
Monroe says: "Get him!"
SpongeBob says: "I suppose I'll never know the true meaning of summer."
SpongeBob says: "I thought I knew it once, but that was a long, long time ago."
Squidward says: "You mean this morning?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
Monroe says: "Come on outside, Mr."
Monroe says: "SquarePants."
Monroe says: "It's a summer miracle!"
Kids says: "Yay!"
Kids says: "Hooray!"

SpongeBob says: "I guess that's the true meaning of summer."
Kids says: "Hooray!"
SpongeBob says: "Where's Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "He's missing out on all the summer fun."
Mr. Krabs says: "Nooo!"
