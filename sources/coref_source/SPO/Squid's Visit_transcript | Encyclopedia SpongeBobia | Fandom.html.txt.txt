The episode starts at the Krusty Krab, outside. The scene then cuts to the inside of the Krusty Krab where Squidward is reading a book called Art. SpongeBob's eye appears through the kitchen window, and he looks at him. Mr. Krabs walks up to Squidward, putting his arm on the cash register-boat, smiling. He tries to clear his throat to attract attention.
Mr. Krabs says: "Bleh!"
Squidward says: "May I help you?"
Mr. Krabs says: "."
Squidward says: "Nope."
Squidward says: "."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Pretty incredible shift, huh?"
Squidward says: "If you say so."
SpongeBob says: "Any plans after work?"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, thank you so much for that lovely invitation but I must respectfully tell you I will never visit you."
Squidward says: "."
Squidward says: "That's probably because I've never visited you."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe some other time."
French Narrator says: "Twenty-four hours later..."
SpongeBob says: "Hey-ho, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "You got any..."
Squidward says: "Before you ask me that question, ask yourself this: Why would I leave the comfort of my home for your dirty little hovel?"
SpongeBob says: "What if I got a couple of throw pillows?"
Patrick says: "Only once."
Patrick says: "To take back some stuff I borrowed."
SpongeBob says: "He said he wouldn't leave the comfort of his own home for my "dirty little hovel"."
SpongeBob says: "That's it!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hey, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Just doin' a little home improvement."
Squidward says: "Well, you made me spill pepper all over my imported rug!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh-okay, Squidward."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Dear Squidward, Thanks For lending me your vacuum cleaner!"
SpongeBob says: "Sincerely, SpongeBob SquarePants."
SpongeBob says: "SquarePants residence."
Squidward says: "Why do you have my vacuum cleaner?"
Squidward says: "That's because I've never called you!"
Squidward says: "Now, why have you stolen my vacuum cleaner?"
SpongeBob says: "I didn't steal it, silly, I borrowed it."
Squidward says: "Are you done cleaning up that dingy hole you call home?"
Squidward says: "Yeah, probably not."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Squidward is finally coming over for a visit!"
Squidward says: "I just want my vacuum back..."
SpongeBob says: "Would you care for a cool and refreshing iced tea?"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Hot hors d'oeuvres?"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Nachos?"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Blancmange?"
Squidward says: "I don't even know what that is!"
Squidward says: "Please just give me my vacuum so I can get back home."
Squidward says: "I have a casserole in the oven!"
SpongeBob says: "Enjoying your visit so far, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "This is not a visit."
Squidward says: "You are going to get my vacuum."
Squidward says: "And stop fluffing this pillow!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Squidward, just yell if you need anything."
Squidward says: "Imbecile."
SpongeBob says: "You yelled?"
SpongeBob says: "Then okay!"
SpongeBob says: "Make yourself at home!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward sure seems to be enjoying his visit."
Squidward says: "That little sneak!"
SpongeBob says: "Did someone say "rash cream?"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, you idiot!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, the rash cream."
SpongeBob says: "I don't think I have a cream for that."
SpongeBob says: "So, are you enjoying your stay at 'Chez Spong√®?"
Squidward says: "Uh..."
Squidward says: "will you excuse me for a moment?"
Squidward says: "I need to use the bathroom again."
SpongeBob says: "Tsk."
Squidward says: "My house..."
Patrick says: "You just missed the fire."
Squidward says: "What happened to my house?"
Fireman says: "Oh, some knucklehead left a casserole in the oven."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Aw, don't worry, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "You're more than welcome to stay at my home until you get your house fixed."
Squidward says: "Why, yes, I'd love another spot of tea, Mr."
Squidward says: "Vacuum Cleaner."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "You okay?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
Scene cuts to nighttime. Squidward was inside SpongeBob's replica. He was about to sleep in his bed.
Squidward says: "Ah..."
Squidward says: "Replica, sweet replica."
Camera goes to outside as Squidward turns out the light. It moves to Squidward's burnt house to see SpongeBob and Gary there. SpongeBob in a sheet, Gary in a piece of paper with his bowl. SpongeBob yawns and stretches.
SpongeBob says: "It sure was nice having Squidward over for a visit, eh, Gary?"
Gary says: "Meow."
