At SpongeBob's house on a windy evening.
Johnny says: "Salutations, heroic devotees!"
Johnny says: "I hope you're securely seated and sufficiently hydrated, because coming up next, it's the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy marathon!"
SpongeBob says: "We got to make sure we have the necessary supplies for this marathon."
Patrick says: "Let's do this!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, how are we on snacks?"
Patrick says: "Oh, hmm..."
Patrick says: "I don't know."
Patrick says: "We might be able to pull through..."
Patrick says: "the first hour."
SpongeBob says: "Check."
SpongeBob says: "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy action figures?"
SpongeBob says: "Check."
SpongeBob says: "Drapes?"
Patrick says: "Check."
SpongeBob says: "Lampshade?"
Patrick says: "Check."
SpongeBob says: "Thermometer?"
SpongeBob says: "Check."
SpongeBob says: "Ukulele, throw pillow, screensaver, incense, snail cozy, headgear?"
Patrick says: "Check."
SpongeBob says: "And..."
Computerized Watch says: "It's time."
Computerized Watch says: "It's time."
Computerized Watch says: "It's time to fight..."
Computerized Watch says: "evil!"
SpongeBob says: "It's time, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "I hope we can make do with the few provisions we have..."
Johnny says: "For sixty-some-odd years, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy have quadruple-handedly kept the sea crime-free."
SpongeBob says: "No..."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Let us in!"
SpongeBob says: "We're missing the Mermaid Man marathon!"
Squidward says: "Go away!"
Squidward says: "I've got better things to do than watch grown men prance around in ridiculous outfits."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, thanks for letting us in, Squidward."
Patrick says: "Yeah, we owe you one!"
Patrick says: "What now, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "All the TVs in Bikini Bottom are knocked out!"
SpongeBob says: "We have to find a secure place, some place that can survive this whirlwind."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, that's it."
SpongeBob says: "If we want to see Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's origin, we'll just go to the source."
SpongeBob says: "Follow me, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Thanks for nothing, Squidward."
Squidward says: "So sorry to have put such a wrinkle in your plans!"
SpongeBob says: "Again!"
Patrick says: "Again!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Oh, boy."
SpongeBob says: "Again!"
Patrick says: "Again!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Do you mind telling us what you're doing here?"
Patrick says: "We wanna watch your TV!"
Barnacle Boy says: "I hate to break it to you kids, but you'll have to go somewhere else."
Barnacle Boy says: "Our power got knocked out in the storm."
Patrick says: "But, but..."
Patrick says: "now how will we ever learn about their secret "gorinin"?"
SpongeBob says: "Hang on a minute, Patrick, we've got Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy standing right over here!"
Patrick says: "..."
Patrick says: "Yeah, so?"
SpongeBob says: "So, if we want to hear their origin, why don't we just ask them?"
Patrick says: "Whoa!"
Patrick says: "You're like a brain professor!"
SpongeBob says: "Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, we wanna know how this all started."
Mermaid Man says: "You wanna go back to the start of it all, eh?"
Mermaid Man says: "Well, you see, in the beginning, it was all dark."
Barnacle Boy says: "Not the beginning of time, Mermaid-Brain."
Barnacle Boy says: "They want to know how we became a crime-fighting duo."
Mermaid Man says: "Oh..."
Mermaid Man says: "right."
Barnacle Boy says: "What are you talking about?"
Mermaid Man says: "Huh?"
Barnacle Boy says: "You're supposed to be telling the story of how we became superheroes!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Wake up, you old coot."
Barnacle Boy says: "Finish the story."
Mermaid Man says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, Mermaid Man, what about Barnacle Boy?"
Patrick says: "Yeah, how'd you two meet?"
Captain says: "Hey, barnacle boy, make sure you scrape the barnacles underneath, too."
Young Barnacle Boy says: "Aye, aye."
Flashback Mermaid Man says: "A boy in trouble!"
Flashback Mermaid Man says: "I've got to act fast or he'll drown."
Flashback Mermaid Man says: "Fear not, young man."
Flashback Mermaid Man says: "I'll take care of this."
Mermaid Man says: "I used my new telekinetic powers to draw barnacles into Barnacle Boy's body, where they took the place of his lungs so he could breathe underwater, too."
Mermaid Man says: "It was at that moment when we decided to team up."
SpongeBob says: "Ohhhh, so that's how you guys got together."
Barnacle Boy says: "No, no, no..."
Barnacle Boy says: "The reason I teamed up with this joker is because I was stuck breathing underwater for the rest of my life."
Mermaid Man says: "Oh..."
Mermaid Man says: "yeah."
Johnny says: "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, superhero crime fighters!"
Banker says: "Stop!"
Banker says: "Thief!"
Flashback Barnacle Boy says: "See if you think this is funny, evildoer."
Flashback Barnacle Boy says: "Who's laughing now, thieving scum?"
Banker says: "Thank you, sir."
Banker says: "And to whom do I owe this debt of gratitude?"
Flashback Mermaid Man says: "You can thank me, Mermaid Man."
Man Ray says: "You're mine!"
Flashback Barnacle Boy says: "How'd you like to taste my tentacle zapper, Man Ray?"
Mermaid Man says: "That didn't happen!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Oh, yes, it did!"
Mermaid Man says: "Oh no, it didn't!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Oh, ha ha, like you remember."
Barnacle Boy says: "You don't even remember where you live."
Mermaid Man says: "It didn't happen!"
Johnny says: "And now, without any further delays, the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Origin Episode."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, this is it!"
Johnny says: "The story of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy all started here."
Tim says: "Come on, Ernie!"
Tim says: "The movie's about to start..."
Tim says: "Where's the popcorn?"
Ernie says: "It's in the microwave, Tim."
Johnny says: "At that very moment in the apartment directly above, a rogue scientist doing tests on radioactive ants knocks over a jar of his infected specimens, one of which, without any hesitation, crawls down one floor and miraculously lands undetected."
Johnny says: "It viciously bites our soon-to-be superhero."
Johnny says: "He screams in pain,..."
Ernie says: "Ahh!"
Johnny says: "..."
Johnny says: "stumbling backwards."
Tim says: "What on earth?"
Johnny says: "In a split-second, both men find themselves in a freefall that sends them squarely through the roof of a vats of acid factory, and into a vat of acid that is tipped over by an errant alien spaceship, carrying the two blindly on a wave of acid during a solar eclipse on a leap year, precariously careening onto a bomb-testing site, where a cataclysmic explosion exposes our heroes in waiting to highly toxic radium gases."
Johnny says: "Then, as fate would have it, magical storm clouds move in, zapping both men with a neon-plaid lightning bolt and raining radioactive ooze, which, through centrifugal and electromagnetic turbulence, causes a powerful earthquake deep in the jungle two-thousand miles away, consequently unearthing a magical crystal with wings that flies to Ernie and Tim's exact location, and, powered by super gamma energy currents, pilots them to open skies until, not paying attention, the crystal clips the top of a billboard, flinging the two back to their apartment miraculously unharmed, when..."
Ernie says: "Hey, the popcorn's ready!"
Johnny says: "..."
Johnny says: "they proceed with movie night and eat slightly overcooked popcorn."
Tim says: "Mmmm..."
Tim says: "I think you overcooked this a little."
Johnny says: "Suddenly, an amazing reaction to the overcooked popcorn hits them with a jolt of cosmic super energy, metamorphosing Ernie into an incredibly strong, seastar-wearing superhero and Tim into a slightly less strong, but also super sailor-looking guy."
Tim says: "I have the sudden and incredibly urge to breathe water instead of air."
Ernie says: "As do I."
Johnny says: "And that is how they became the superheroes we have come to know as..."
Barnacle Boy says: "Oh, feels just like yesterday, doesn't it, Mermaid Man?"
Mermaid Man says: "..."
Mermaid Man says: "No, not really."
Barnacle Boy says: "Hmm..."
Barnacle Boy says: "Oh, so what do you boys think?"
Barnacle Boy says: "Boys?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Patrick, the overcooked popcorn will be ready in twelve minutes!"
Patrick says: "This is gonna be so super awesome!"
SpongeBob says: "So superhero awesome!"
Mermaid Man says: "No!"
Barnacle Boy says: "No!"
Mermaid Man says: "Stop!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Stop!"
Mermaid Man says: "But you're not superhero material!"
Barnacle Boy says: "But you're not superhero material!"
Mermaid Man says: "Look at those shoes!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Look at those shoes!"
