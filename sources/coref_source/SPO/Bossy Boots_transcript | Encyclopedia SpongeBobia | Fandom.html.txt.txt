At the Krusty Krab, Squidward is at the ordering boat and SpongeBob is looking out from the ordering window. Mr. Krabs' voice sounds on the P.A.
Mr. Krabs says: "Attention!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Attention!"
Mr. Krabs says: "All Krusty Krew employees, attention!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I have an important announcement to make."
SpongeBob says: "Woo!"
SpongeBob says: "Hooray!"
SpongeBob says: "The new spatulas are here!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Sit down, boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "There's no new spatulers!"
Squidward says: "How disappointing."
Mr. Krabs says: "You may know me daughter Pearl."
Mr. Krabs says: "She's growing up fast."
Pearl says: "Hello, daddy?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Thar she blows!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, do you realize what this means?"
SpongeBob says: "No new spatulas?"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "It means some bratty teenager's coming in here to tell us what to do."
Squidward says: "We can't have that!"
Squidward says: "We have seniority, right?"
SpongeBob says: "Right!"
Squidward says: "So, we'll work together to protect our pathetic positions."
SpongeBob says: "Okey-dokey, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "And then we'll get those new spatulas!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Say hello to me Pearl."
SpongeBob says: "Hello, pole."
Pearl says: "Hi, guys."
Mr. Krabs says: "It makes me jolly as a roger to have you finally aboard the family business!"
Pearl says: "Great, dad, because I have so many new ideas."
SpongeBob says: "What's in the box?"
Pearl says: "It's a surprise."
SpongeBob says: "I like surprises."
Pearl says: "Great, then close your eyes."
Squidward says: "Well, I like it so far."
Squidward says: "Okay, this is it, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Now tell her how you really feel about that uniform."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Pearl..."
SpongeBob says: "this is the greatest uniform ever!"
Squidward says: "Fish paste."
Pearl says: "Oh, SpongeBob, you look so adorable."
Pearl says: "I could just eat you up."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Pearl, but this item's not on the menu!"
Squidward says: "Well, I didn't think it was possible, SpongeBob, but you look even more ridiculous than usual."
Pearl says: "Don't feel jealous, Uncle Squiddy."
Pearl says: "I made one for you, too."
Squidward says: "Don't bother!"
Squidward says: "Only a fool would wear that!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get that suit on, sailor."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's already been paid for."
Squidward says: "Rage."
Squidward says: "Fury."
Squidward says: "Irritation."
Squidward says: "Humiliation."
Pearl says: "Squidward is such a barnacle."
SpongeBob says: "A stick in the sand."
Pearl says: "But not you, SpongeBob."
Pearl says: "You are full of style."
SpongeBob says: "Me?"
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
Pearl says: "Totally, S."
Pearl says: "B."
Pearl says: "You ooze fashion."
Pearl says: "And I've got some completely coral concepts for this old joint, and I'm going to need someone with your kind of talent to help me."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I have been trying to get Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs to make a few changes around here."
Pearl says: "Why, with my girlish instincts and your um..."
Pearl says: "sponginess,  we'll turn this worn-out lunch wagon into a teenage paradise."
Pearl says: "SpongeBob, what do you like better?"
Pearl says: "The Kutie Krab or the Kooky Krab?"
Squidward says: "For what, dare I ask?"
Pearl says: "The new name for our new look."
Pearl says: "I mean, "The Krusty Krab" has got to go."
Pearl says: "Who wants to eat at a place they think is crusty?"
Pearl says: "Bleh!"
Squidward says: "Well, sure it's a terrible name, but this is a terrible place."
Squidward says: "Therefore, the name should be left alone."
Squidward says: "Right, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "I got it!"
SpongeBob says: "How about The Khaotic Krab?"
Pearl says: "Hmm..."
Pearl says: "how about The Kissy Krab?"
SpongeBob says: "The King Krab?"
Pearl says: "The Kandy Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "The Killer Krab!"
Pearl says: "Aaah!"
Pearl says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "You're right, too scary."
SpongeBob says: "The Kuddly Krab!"
Pearl says: "The Kuddly Krab!"
Millie says: "It's a shame old man Krabs sold the Krusty Krab."
Fred says: "That's a darn shame."
Fred says: "Hey, lady!"
Fred says: "Do you know where we can get something to eat around here?"
Squidward says: "That's it!"
Squidward says: "I quit!"
Shelia says: "Finally!"
Shelia says: "A cool place for teens to just, you know, hang out!"
SpongeBob says: "Pearl, you're a genius."
SpongeBob says: "All these young, hip new customers."
SpongeBob says: "Phooey on Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "He can't keep up with the times."
SpongeBob says: "You're a true visionary, Pearl."
Pearl says: "Thank you, SpongeBob."
Pearl says: "I do have 20/20 vision."
SpongeBob says: "Well, hip people have to eat, too."
SpongeBob says: "Back to the grill."
Pearl says: "SpongeBob, order up!"
SpongeBob says: "Two..."
SpongeBob says: "sa-lads."
SpongeBob says: "Never heard of it."
SpongeBob says: "I got to stay hip."
SpongeBob says: "I don't want to end up like silly old Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "But what in the name of Davy Jones' locker is a  Here you go."
SpongeBob says: "Two sa-lads."
Pearl says: "Ew, gross."
Pearl says: "Those aren't salads."
Pearl says: "Take those back."
Pearl says: "Remove the bun, the patty and the condiments."
SpongeBob says: "But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato."
Pearl says: "Exactly."
SpongeBob says: "All right."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I've ever saw."
Nazz says: "This is so cool!"
SpongeBob says: "Where's the grill?"
Pearl says: "Come on, SpongeBob, you're a hip guy."
Pearl says: "You know that fried foods are O-U-T, out!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh..."
SpongeBob says: "right on."
Pearl says: "Check out this new menu I came up with."
SpongeBob says: "Salad and tea."
SpongeBob says: "But where are the Krabby Patties?"
Pearl says: "Silly, those aren't hip."
Pearl says: "And you won't be needing that thing anymore."
Gus says: "Hey, buddy, you need a ride?"
Gus says: "I was just on my way to the big doofus convention!"
SpongeBob says: "This is humiliating."
SpongeBob says: "I'm a fry cook, darn it!"
SpongeBob says: "You can take away my spatula, but when you take away my dignity, that's when I get mad!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm going to march right up to Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs' office and tell him this is just too much!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Come on in, me boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Have a seat."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't you just love me new office?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Pearl designed it for me."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, um, I think we have a problem."
Mr. Krabs says: "Isn't that the neatest $40 chair you ever sat in?"
SpongeBob says: "Sure, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, but I've got some bad news."
Mr. Krabs says: "How about my cuddly executive buddy?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why, Pearl is saving the Krusty Krab!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I mean, the Kuddly Krab."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, you're right, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "But I can't fire me pride and joy, it'll break her fragile little heart!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What am I going to do?"
SpongeBob says: "There, there, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sure there's another way."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's it, boy!"
SpongeBob says: "What's it?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You could fire her!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's okay if she hates you."
SpongeBob says: "That's not what I said, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "Great then, it's all settled: you fire Pearly, I'll wait in me office."
Pearl says: "Totally rude, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Pearl, can I see to you in the kitchen for a second?"
Pearl says: "Sure, SpongeBob."
Pearl says: "I can't take it anymore!"
Pearl says: "Nothing I do is working!"
SpongeBob says: "Sure it is, Pearl."
SpongeBob says: "Look at all the hip, young people eating sa-lads!"
Pearl says: "No, don't you get it?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Pearl says: "I've been trying to get fired since day one!"
Pearl says: "I was only pretending to like this place to please Daddy."
Pearl says: "This job is cutting majorly into my social life."
Pearl says: "Oh, SpongeBob, what should I do?"
SpongeBob says: ""fire you."
SpongeBob says: "" I'll take the heat from old man Krabs later."
Pearl says: "Gosh, you'd really do that for me?"
Pearl says: "You're a great pal, SpongeBob."
Pearl says: "How can I ever thank you?!"
Pearl says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Stop trying to break me in half?"
Pearl says: "Oh, boy!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Pearl."
SpongeBob says: "We've got to make this convincing."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh no, here it goes!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't know if I can bear to listen."
SpongeBob says: "It's not that you haven't done a good job around here, it's just that..."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's for the best."
SpongeBob says: "Well, we feel it might be in everybody's best interest if..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I can't let him do this!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get on with it, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Pearl, you're fired."
Pearl says: "Thanks, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I did it!"
SpongeBob says: "There, there, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Pearl took it just fine, in fact, she seemed sort of happy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Really?"
SpongeBob says: "She's off to bigger and better things."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's me old girl; tough as nails, just like her old man!"
SpongeBob says: "Isn't this great, Gary?"
SpongeBob says: "And it only cost me one year's salary!"
Gary says: "Meow?"
