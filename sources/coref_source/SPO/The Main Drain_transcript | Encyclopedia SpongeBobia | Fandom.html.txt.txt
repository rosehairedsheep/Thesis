At the Krusty Krab, we see SpongeBob coming out of the freezer with a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob says: "Nothing like a fresh frozen Krabby Patty with extra freezer burn flavor."
Customer says: "Yeah, I like to order..."
Squidward says: "Hold that thought."
Customer says: "Uh, so I like to order..."
Customer says: "I would like a Krabby Patty."
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "I do not want a Krabby Patty!"
SpongeBob says: "You suuure?"
Squidward says: "Don't touch me."
Customer says: "Why don't you want a Krabby Patty?"
Squidward says: "I've seen what he cleans the grill with."
SpongeBob says: "Now all I need is a fresh patty."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, where'd all this water come from?"
Patrick says: "There I was, walking along, just minding my own business and then boom!"
Patrick says: "Whatcha doing?"
SpongeBob says: "Trying to see what has this sink all backed up."
SpongeBob says: "Would you excuse me a second?"
Patrick says: "Uh-huh."
SpongeBob says: "The drain plug."
Mr. Krabs says: "What in Neptune's bathtub do you think you're doing, lad?"
SpongeBob says: "The sink is clogged, so I was going to pull out the drain plug."
Mr. Krabs says: "Stop messing with that drain plug!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Are you daft?"
SpongeBob says: "Why don't you want me to pull out the drain plug, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr Krabs says: "Why don't I, but..."
Mr Krabs says: "hmm..."
Mr Krabs says: "one sec."
Mr Krabs says: "Patrick."
Patrick says: "Sorry."
Mr. Krabs says: "As I was saying..."
Mr. Krabs says: "..."
Mr. Krabs says: "to a pair of little kids."
Green Kid says: "â™ªDadadada-dum-da-dumdumdum."
Orange Kid says: "Whooooo."
Kids says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "The Main Drain."
Mr. Krabs says: "Legend has it that their curiosity got the best of 'em."
Mr. Krabs says: "And nobody was ever heard from..."
Mr. Krabs says: "again."
SpongeBob says: "Where is the Main Drain, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well it right, I..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't know where it is, and I'm certainly not going to tell you."
Patrick says: "Mr."
Patrick says: "Krabs sure has a lot of baggage about drain dealies."
SpongeBob says: "The Main Drain sounds very, very dangerous."
SpongeBob says: "I'm never gonna go near that thing."
Patrick says: "We should go find it, to protect it from people like us."
SpongeBob says: "What if we get sucked in like those other two kids?"
Patrick says: "Ohh, don't worry, we're not little kids."
Patrick says: "We're all grown up!"
Patrick says: "Hey!"
Patrick says: "A baby tooth!"
SpongeBob says: "Who's been at Bikini Bottom for as long as Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
The two hear a crunching sound, as SpongeBob has just stepped on Plankton.
Plankton says: "Ow!"
Patrick says: "Eww..."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hi, Plankton!"
SpongeBob peels him off of his shoe, taking off skin.
Plankton says: "Eeeeooww!"
Patrick says: "Let's ask Plankton."
Patrick says: "He's a geezer."
Plankton says: "What stupid question do you want the answer to, idiots?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick and I are trying to find the Main Drain."
Plankton says: "The Main Drain?"
Plankton says: "What are you to bothering me for?"
Plankton says: "I mean I-I don't know where the Main Drain is."
Plankton says: "It's a myth anyway, it doesn't exist."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, but Mr."
Plankton says: "Krabs?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Plankton says: "Why that- Well, he was just telling you a fish tail."
Plankton says: "There's no such thing as a Drain at the bottom of the sea."
Plankton says: "So go on, scram, shoe, get outta here!"
SpongeBob and Patrick walk away.
Plankton says: "Why on earth would Krabs tell those two blunderers about the Main Drain?"
Cuts to downtown Bikini Bottom where SpongeBob and Patrick are walking.
SpongeBob says: "I wonder who else knows about the Main Drain."
Old Man Jenkins pulls SpongeBob and Patrick in his house.
Both says: "Old Man Jenkins!"
Old Man Jenkins says: "Why are you two asking about the Main Drain?"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs told us a story of how the Main Drain once destroyed Bikini Bottom."
Patrick says: "So we've been looking for it!"
SpongeBob says: "Does the Main Drain even exist?"
Old Man Jenkins says: "Ohh, it exists alright."
Old Man Jenkins says: "But it's been..."
Old Man Jenkins says: "uhhh..."
Old Man Jenkins says: "hushed up."
SpongeBob says: "Where is the Drain, oh, wise Jenkins?"
Old Man Jenkins says: "I have no idea."
SpongeBob and Patrick walk out of his house.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "We need to find that Drain!"
Patrick says: "Why?"
SpongeBob says: "Isn't your curiosity piqued?"
SpongeBob says: "What if somebody accidentally pulls it?"
Patrick says: "Oh man, I hope this question's not for me."
Patrick says: "I hate questions."
SpongeBob says: "What do you think, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Dah-uhhh!"
Patrick says: "42."
Patrick says: "No, triangle!"
Patrick says: "Meatballs!"
Patrick says: "Screwdrivers!"
Patrick says: "Pajamas!"
SpongeBob says: "I hear ya' Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Let's go find that Main Drain!"
Patrick says: "Okay."
SpongeBob and Patrick pack to go on a trip.
SpongeBob says: "Let's start walkin'."
Patrick says: "Oh, no thanks."
Patrick says: "I'm not into the whole walking thing."
SpongeBob says: "But, Patrick how are we gonna get to the center of the ocean?"
Patrick says: "Wait for it to come to us."
SpongeBob says: "Hmmmm..."
SpongeBob says: "I have a better idea!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, what do you think?"
Patrick says: "I love it!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, that's out."
Both says: "Hmmmm..."
SpongeBob says: "I know!"
They and the rock plummet while the both of them scream.
SpongeBob says: "Ohh."
SpongeBob says: "How are we gonna find the center of the ocean now?"
SpongeBob says: "Hmmm..."
Patrick says: "Hmmm..."
Patrick says: "Oh!"
Patrick says: "Oh!"
Patrick says: "I know exactly what to do!"
Squidward says: "That's better..."
Patrick continues to pull the rock. getting faster.
SpongeBob says: "Doin' great, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "We'll be there in no time!"
Patrick says: "Huh, I found it!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow, good job!"
Patrick says: "Let's pull it."
SpongeBob says: "What?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Why would we do that?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "Well, that was the whole point of coming here."
Patrick says: "Wasn't it?"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "We came to see if it was real!"
Patrick says: "Well, how do we know if this one is a fake?"
SpongeBob says: "We- We don't know..."
Patrick says: "We won't know unless we pull it!"
SpongeBob says: "But..."
SpongeBob says: "if we pull it, and if it's real, the world may end."
Patrick says: "And if we don't, we'll never know."
The camera changes back and forth between shots of SpongeBob's scared face and shots of Patrick reaching for the handle, until Mr. Krabs and Plankton stopped them.
Mr. Krabs says: "No!"
Plankton says: "No!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Boys, there's more to that story about the Drain!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You see..."
Plankton says: "We were the two ding-a-lings who pulled that plug."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's right."
Mr. Krabs says: "One day, Plankton and I were wandering around."
Another flashback appears which was almost the same as Mr. Krabs' first story.
Mr. Krabs says: "You see, we had to lie to keep you from lookin' for it."
Plankton says: "We just didn't want you to make the same mistake we made."
SpongeBob says: "Phew."
SpongeBob says: "That was a close one..."
Patrick says: "Yeah, We almost messed up big time."
Patrick says: "Phew."
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
