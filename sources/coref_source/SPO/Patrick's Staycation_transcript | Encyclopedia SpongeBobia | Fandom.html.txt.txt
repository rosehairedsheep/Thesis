Patrick says: "Hyah!"
SpongeBob says: "Weren't you going to put your vacation slides in the projector, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, those are hash browns."
Patrick says: "Hash browns!"
SpongeBob says: "Um, Patrick, the slides."
Patrick says: "Right."
Patrick says: "The slides."
Patrick says: "Voila!"
Patrick says: "Uh, now what?"
SpongeBob says: "Now you put the slides in the projector."
Patrick says: "There I was..."
SpongeBob says: "Ooh, a shadow puppet show!"
Patrick says: "Please, no interruptions."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry."
Patrick says: "As I was saying..."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what have you done to yourself?"
Patrick says: "Help me, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "Please, help me."
SpongeBob says: "Pal, what you need is a vacation."
Patrick says: "That's it!"
Patrick says: "I need a vacation!"
Travel Agent says: "So, you'd like a vacation."
Patrick says: "Oh, great."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, he'd like a vacation."
Travel Agent says: "Well, your options are endless, Mr."
Travel Agent says: "Star."
Travel Agent says: "Anywhere from beautiful white sandy beaches to exhilarating jungle safaris."
Travel Agent says: "It all depends on your budget."
SpongeBob says: "Ugh!"
Patrick says: "Ugh!"
Patrick says: "I guess I'll just have to stay home."
SpongeBob says: ""Stay home"?"
SpongeBob says: "That's it!"
SpongeBob says: "You can take a "stay-cation."
Patrick says: "Wh-what's that?"
SpongeBob says: "Take a vacation at home."
SpongeBob says: "No packing, no travel, just do whatever you want to do."
SpongeBob says: "Best of all, it's free."
Patrick says: "Oh, boy!"
SpongeBob says: "All right, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Enjoy your stay-cation."
Patrick says: "That's what I'm gonna do, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "Welcome to Star Rock Inn, sir."
SpongeBob says: "My name is Todd."
SpongeBob says: "Can I check you in?"
Patrick says: "I don't know."
Patrick says: "Can you?"
SpongeBob says: "Ah, yes."
SpongeBob says: "Star, Star, Star."
SpongeBob says: "May I take your bags, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Star?"
SpongeBob says: "Follow me, sir."
SpongeBob says: "Your room is right this way."
SpongeBob says: "Your room, sir."
Patrick says: "Oh, dear."
SpongeBob says: "Something wrong, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Star?"
Patrick says: "Well, um, honestly, I'm not sure I like the way this room is arranged."
SpongeBob says: "Arranged?"
Narrator says: "One Hour Later."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Star, are you sure about this?"
Patrick says: "No, I--uh, maybe it's the walls."
Patrick says: "I got it."
Patrick says: "Let's put the room back the way it was originally!"
SpongeBob says: "The pool is one of Star Rock Inn's most relaxing features."
Patrick says: "Ah a pool!"
Patrick says: "Where's the diving board?"
SpongeBob says: "The diving board?"
SpongeBob says: "Ooh, one diving board, coming up."
SpongeBob says: "Your diving board, sir."
Patrick says: "All right!"
SpongeBob says: "You okay, sir?"
Patrick says: "My head is swimming just fine, thank you."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, no!"
SpongeBob says: "You okay, sir?"
Patrick says: "So cold."
SpongeBob says: "This calls for CPR—"
SpongeBob says: "candy peppermint resuscitation."
Patrick says: "So weak."
Patrick says: "But I'm still hungry."
SpongeBob says: "Follow me, sir."
Patrick says: "Wow."
Patrick says: "What luxury."
SpongeBob says: "One Krabby Patty coming up."
Patrick says: "Hey, what kind of resort is this?"
Patrick says: "Where's the entertainment?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, uh, you are absolutely right, sir."
SpongeBob says: "What the hey."
Patrick says: "Boring."
Man says: "Three, two, one, liftoff."
SpongeBob says: "Well, what do you think?"
Patrick says: "You are smokin'!"
SpongeBob says: "Aw, it was nothing."
Patrick says: "No, no, you're really smoking!"
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Patrick says: "My tummy is still lonely."
Patrick says: "I am quite refined."
Squidward says: "What are you doing here?"
Patrick says: "I'm on vacation!"
Patrick says: "The last resort I was staying at was a dump, but this place is awesome."
Patrick says: "Oh, hey, waiter..."
SpongeBob says: "Ah!"
Squidward says: "Patrick, you dimwitted moron, get out of my kitchen!"
Patrick says: "Good idea."
Patrick says: "I think I'll head over to the spa."
Patrick says: "I could use a massage."
Squidward says: "Get this into your tiny, tiny, little, tiny brain—"
Squidward says: "this is not a resort."
Squidward says: "It's my house."
Squidward says: "There is no spa."
Squidward says: "And you can't get a massage!"
Patrick says: "Hey, you should get a massage, too."
Squidward says: "Move over."
Squidward says: "I want a deep tissue treatment and don't forget the feet."
Narrator says: "5 Hours Later."
Squidward is sleeping and SpongeBob is tired out.
SpongeBob says: "So tired."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what are you doing here?"
Patrick says: "That resort next door is too crowded."
Patrick says: "Then I found this place."
Patrick says: "It's quiet and peaceful."
Patrick says: "Good night, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "Wake up, laddy."
SpongeBob says: "Hmm?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hi, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "You have another nasty old dream?"
SpongeBob says: "Mm-mmm."
Mr. Krabs says: "Patrick in your bed again?"
SpongeBob says: "Mm-hmm."
Mr. Krabs says: "Aye."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, good night, laddy."
SpongeBob says: "Good night, sir."
Cricket chirps.
