A green car comes driving up and stops. Kelp Thing gets out.
Mermaid Man is shown on a building.
Kelp Thing says: "Huh?"
Kelp Thing says: "Eh?"
Narrator says: "It's Mermaid Man!"
Narrator says: "Savior of the deep!"
Narrator says: "And his young fit servant, Barnacle Boy."
Mermaid Man says: "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy..."
Mermaid Man says: "unite!"
Mermaid Man says: "Kelp Thing, this is a posted, no-parking zone."
Kelp Thing says: "But I must do what I do."
Mermaid Man says: "Evil can't park here between the hours of 6:00am and 12:00pm!"
Club Leader says: "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club members unite!"
All says: "Unite!"
Club Leader says: "And now the second order of business: Drippy Brothers Studios is currently in production of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie!"
All says: "Ooh!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, boy, Patrick, I can hardly wait to see our favorite heroes on the big screen!"
Patrick laughs.
Club Leader says: "Third order of business, the special surprise guest!"
Fake Mermaid Man says: "Hello, little heroes."
Patrick says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "You're not Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy."
SpongeBob says: "You're fakes!"
Fake Mermaid Man says: "Well, of course, we are."
Fake Mermaid Man says: "We're actors."
SpongeBob says: "Actors?"
SpongeBob says: "How can they make a Mermaid Man movie without the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?"
Fake Mermaid Man says: "Listen, kid."
Fake Mermaid Man says: "This is an action movie!"
Fake Mermaid Man says: "Your has-been heroes are too OLD for action."
SpongeBob says: "Mermaid Man is timeless!"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "I think I speak for everyone here when I say we won't stand for these two phony-baloneys ruining the good name of our heroes."
SpongeBob says: "No right-minded Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy society member would ever pay to see this..."
SpongeBob says: "this celluloid hoax."
SpongeBob says: "I say we boycott this movie!"
SpongeBob says: "Now who's with me?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Announcer says: "B-47."
Mermaid Man says: "BONKO!"
Barnacle Boy says: "It's "bingo"!"
Mermaid Man says: "Get your hands off me, woman!"
Announcer says: "A-29."
SpongeBob says: "Too old for an action movie..."
SpongeBob says: "huh."
Barnacle Boy says: "What is it this time, kid?"
SpongeBob says: "Are you aware Drippy Brothers Studio is making the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie?"
Barnacle Boy says: "They can't be making a movie about us!"
SpongeBob says: "But they are!"
SpongeBob says: "And they're using..."
SpongeBob says: "actors."
The heroes gasp.
SpongeBob says: "They have shunned our heroes."
Patrick says: "And they weren't nice to them either."
Mermaid Man says: "Now our dreams of being big screen heroes will never come true!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, that makes it even worse."
Barnacle Boy says: "You bet it does, kid."
Mermaid Man says: "And the worst part is, I can't remember why I started crying!"
Patrick says: "Why don't we just make our own movie?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, once again, you have exposed your brilliance."
SpongeBob says: "We'll make a real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie."
SpongeBob says: "Right here at Shady Shoals."
Mermaid Man says: "You will?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes!"
SpongeBob says: "And in doing so, we will right the wrong done to you by the evil Drippy Brothers Studios and..."
SpongeBob says: "their actors."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Patrick, what do we need to start a movie?"
Patrick says: "Popcorn?"
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick, to start making a movie."
Patrick says: "Oh, oh, oh..."
SpongeBob says: "Let's start with..."
SpongeBob says: "the title."
Patrick says: "Yeah, yeah."
Patrick says: "Ooh!"
Patrick says: "I got one!"
Patrick says: ""Adventures in the Underground City"."
SpongeBob says: "Great, Pat, what happens?"
Patrick says: "Well, there's a city..."
SpongeBob says: "City..."
Patrick says: "And it's underground..."
SpongeBob says: "Underground..."
Patrick says: "And they have an adventure..."
SpongeBob says: "Adventure..."
Patrick says: "The end."
SpongeBob says: "End."
SpongeBob says: "Hmm, seems kinda short."
Patrick says: "I have an idea."
Patrick says: "Let's make it longer!"
SpongeBob says: "Longer, yes."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, let's have Mermaid Man get his face..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "shrunk by Kelp-Thing's face minimizer!"
Patrick says: "Yeah, and then he..."
Patrick says: "umm..."
Patrick says: "he drinks..."
Patrick says: "cheese coffee!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What are ye lads doing?"
SpongeBob says: "We're making a movie."
Mr. Krabs says: "Great!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I got cinema's newest star, right here."
Mr. Krabs says: "So, what do ye say, lad?"
SpongeBob says: "Sure, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, Pearl can be in our movie."
Mr. Krabs says: "I wasn't talking about Pearl."
Mr. Krabs says: "I was talking about the Krabby Patty."
Pearl looks at the Krabby Patty and cries.
SpongeBob says: "You can be in it, too, Pearl."
SpongeBob says: "Let's meet the highly skilled professionals who will help us fulfill your dream of being on the big screen."
SpongeBob says: "Sandy will handle the stunts and explosives."
Sandy says: "Howdy."
SpongeBob says: "Pearl is the leading lady."
SpongeBob says: "Mr Krabs will cater the affair."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick will run the camera."
Patrick says: "Hey..."
SpongeBob says: "This is Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "He's in charge of the makeup department."
Squidward says: "Uh, no thanks."
Squidward says: "Who wants to be the 'makeup department'?"
SpongeBob says: "Not makeup department, you're the makeup 'artist'."
Squidward says: "Artist?"
SpongeBob says: "Makeup artist."
Squidward says: "In that case, let's make those old crabapples sizzle."
Squidward says: "Voila!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, places everybody."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, are our heroes ready?"
Squidward says: "As they'll ever be."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, action!"
Sandy says: "I love my new job!"
SpongeBob says: "Good job, Sandy!"
Plankton says: "Psst..."
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing?"
Plankton says: "SpongeBob, this role was made for me."
SpongeBob says: "That villain isn't even in this movie."
SpongeBob says: "But let me see if we have something that fits your qualifications."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, here's something."
SpongeBob says: "You can be the boom operator!"
Plankton says: "I thought Sandy was the boom operator!"
Sandy says: "Did somebody say boom?"
Plankton says: "All right, SpongeBob, but you're squandering my talents!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Patrick, start the movie!"
Assistant says: "Take 1."
Mermaid Man says: "We have to get back to those swollen Krabby Patties."
SpongeBob says: "Cut!"
SpongeBob says: "No, Mermaid Man, it's "stolen Krabby Patties."
Assistant says: "Take 2."
Mermaid Man says: "We have to get back to those stolen naggie daddies."
SpongeBob says: "Cut!"
SpongeBob says: "No, Mermaid Man, it's "stolen Krabby Patties!"
Assistant says: "Take 5,003."
Mermaid Man says: "We have to get back to those stolen Krabby Patties!"
Plankton says: "Give it back!"
Barnacle Boy says: "I knew this was a bad idea."
SpongeBob says: "Cut!"
SpongeBob says: "Plankton, next time could you keep the boom out of shot?"
SpongeBob says: "Other than that, you're doing a super job."
Plankton says: "This is humiliating."
Plankton says: "I'm not good at this boom thing."
Sandy says: "Did somebody say boom?"
Pearl says: "Oh, daddy, you said I was going to be a star!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You are, Pearl."
Mr. Krabs says: "Mermaid Man wouldn't be anywhere without you."
Mr. Krabs says: "Go out there and break a leg."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, action!"
Mermaid Man says: "To the boat mobile."
SpongeBob says: "Cue the sound effects."
Mermaid Man says: "Listen to that engine purr."
SpongeBob says: "Almost there!"
Patrick says: "Good morning, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Everything's ruined!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, at least we got the footage."
Patrick says: "Yeah, I got the footage."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what is that?"
Patrick says: "Oh, it's a camera."
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick, this."
Patrick says: "Oh, that's a lens cap."
SpongeBob says: "Did you just put that on?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "Yup, I didn't want to lose it, so I put it there right before we started filming."
SpongeBob screams and goes insane, scoots his butt on the ground, lifts up piece of ground, and eats worms on bottom side. Everyone gasps.
SpongeBob says: "The movie's ruined!"
SpongeBob says: "We can't make a movie."
Mermaid Man says: "Hey, little hero, this reminds me of the Episode 912."
Mermaid Man says: "We were surrounded."
Mermaid Man says: "The Kelp-Thing was to our right and their broccoli was on the side."
Mermaid Man says: "But if there was one thing I remember, it was how to forget."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, this is good."
SpongeBob says: "Roll the film."
Mermaid Man says: "The rain in Spain stays mainly on the..."
Mermaid Man says: "space!"
Mermaid Man says: "The final countdown."
Mermaid Man says: "Stick to the..."
Mermaid Man says: "stick to the..."
Mermaid Man says: "Lou, my darling!"
Mermaid Man says: "Lou!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, why are you weeping?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I closed early for your movie."
Mr. Krabs says: "Where are the paying customers?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You promised a full house!"
SpongeBob says: "And here comes the filling--  The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club!"
SpongeBob says: "I knew you'd come to see the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie."
Club Leader says: "Actually, the real movie was sold out."
Club Leader says: "I'll take 200 tickets, please."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, this is what I call a happy ending."
SpongeBob says: "It is I, Kelp-Thing!"
SpongeBob says: "Do what I do!"
Mermaid Man says: "Stop!"
Mermaid Man says: "You can't do that forbidden."
SpongeBob says: "Watch me!"
Mermaid Man says: "Prepare to feel my wrath, you foul villain."
Mermaid Man says: "Well, kid, you showed the world that even though our steps may have been slowed, we still have a little action left in these heroic old bones."
Barnacle Boy says: "Well, at least some of them."
