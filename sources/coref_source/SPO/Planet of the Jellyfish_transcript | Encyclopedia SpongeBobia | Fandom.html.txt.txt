SpongeBob catches three jellyfish in his net.
SpongeBob says: "Weee!"
SpongeBob says: "Gotchya!"
SpongeBob says: "There you go, little fella."
SpongeBob says: "Say, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Don't you think that Jellyfish Fields has gotten bigger today?"
Patrick says: "I don't know, but all of this failure is tiring me out."
Patrick says: "I'm just gonna take a nap on that rock right over there."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I'll go see if there are any jellyfish in that creepy, scary, evil-looking cave over there."
Evil Alien Jellyfish Overlord is shown.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, well!"
SpongeBob says: "I guess it's catch and release for now."
Evil Alien Jellyfish Overlord catches a jellyfish and turns it into a Jellien; soon the Overlord makes more Jelliens. Patrick is shown sleeping. The Jellien engulfs Patrick's entire body and creates a Jellien Patrick. Some Jellien's take the real Patrick away. Tentacles extend out of Jellien Patrick's mouth and place Patrick's jellyfish net in Jellien Patrick into his hand.
SpongeBob says: "And he doesn't sting."
Jellien Patrick captures numerous jellyfish in his net.
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
Jellien Patrick says: "Yes."
Jellien Patrick says: "I too have caught many jellyfish."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "That's a great idea."
Bubble transition to Squidward's house at night.
SpongeBob says: "Well, we've given a jellyfish to everyone, except Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sure he doesn't want one."
Jellien Patrick says: "He will take one and like it."
Jellien Patrick says: "Pleasant dreams, square one."
SpongeBob says: "Hah, back at ya good buddy."
Jellien Squidward says: "Don't let the bed bugs bite."
Jellien Squidward says: "Ha ha ha."
SpongeBob says: "Um, that's some good advice."
SpongeBob says: "Good night, Squidward."
Jellien Squidward says: "There will be plenty of biting this night."
Jellien Squidward says: "BRAAAP!"
Bubble transition.
SpongeBob says: "Hey, hey!"
SpongeBob says: "Are you okay back there?"
Bubble transition to morning. The Jellien is shown sleeping.
SpongeBob says: "Aw, look at him, the little angel."
SpongeBob says: "Guess he couldn't make it past the third feature."
SpongeBob says: "You two stay out of trouble, bye!"
SpongeBob leaves his house and Gary takes a nap near a plant. The Jellien then eats Gary and the plant at the same time creating Jellien Gary, which looks like Gary mixed with a plant. Bubble transition to SpongeBob walking into the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
SpongeBob says: "Look at all of the customers!"
Jellien Clone says: "One Krabby Patty, hold the mayonnaise."
Jellien Squidward says: "One Krabby Patty, hold the mayonnaise."
Jellien Patrick says: "One Krabby Patty, hold the mayonnaise."
Jellien Squidward says: "Thank you, come again."
Jellien Clone says: "BRAAAP!"
Jellien Squidward says: "BRAAAP!"
The next customer, who appears normal walks up.
Jellien Squidward says: "One Krabby Patty, hold the mayonnaise."
Jellien Squidward says: "BRAAAP!"
Martin says: "Ugh."
Martin says: "Actually I want one with extra mayo!"
Jellien Squidward and the rest of the Jellien Clones begin hissing and pointing at the lone, normal fish.
Martin says: "W-what's wrong, dudes?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing?"
SpongeBob says: "Cooking Krabby Patties is my job."
Jellien Patrick says: "I am here to replace you and all of your kind!"
SpongeBob says: "I saw that movie last night, too."
SpongeBob says: "Whoops!"
SpongeBob says: "If you're going work here, you're going to need an official Krusty Krab hat."
Jellien Patrick says: "Hat?"
SpongeBob says: "Say, that's a pretty neat trick!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm going to get some extra mayonnaise from the back."
SpongeBob says: "O..."
SpongeBob says: "kay?"
Jellien Squidward says: "Hi, SpongeBob!"
Jellien Squidward says: "Don't you want this cute little jellyfish?"
SpongeBob says: "Ha ha..."
SpongeBob says: "uh, no thanks."
SpongeBob says: "Ah!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Jellien Mr. Krabs says: "You seem tired, SpongeBob."
Jellien Mr. Krabs says: "Why don't you go home and take a nap?"
Jellien Squidward says: "Yes, and you can use this jelly as a pillow."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, that's okay."
SpongeBob says: "I-I have one at home."
SpongeBob says: "Hah..."
Jellien Squidward says: "Sleep well."
Jellien Mr. Krabs says: "Sleep well."
Jellien Harold says: "Sleep!"
SpongeBob says: "Ah!"
SpongeBob says: "Random guy!"
Sandy says: "Alright, you rotten jelly clone!"
Sandy says: "What have you done with SpongeBob?!"
Sandy says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm no clone, Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "I am SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "Then you won't mind if I run a simple test."
Sandy says: "Cootchie Cootchie coo!"
Sandy says: "Cootchie Cootchie Cootchie Coo!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "no!"
SpongeBob says: "not the cootchie cootchie coo!"
Sandy says: "You're SpongeBob, alright..."
Bubble transition to where SpongeBob is free.
SpongeBob says: "What are we going to do, Sandy?"
Sandy says: "If only we knew the Jellien's weakness."
SpongeBob says: "Well, the only thing I know is that they can't stand mayonnaise."
Sandy says: "Ew, I don't like mayonnaise neither."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, so you don't like mayo?"
SpongeBob says: "Just like a Jellien!"
Sandy says: "Oh, snap out of it, SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "Now if only we had some mayonnaise."
SpongeBob says: "There's lot at the Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "But we'll never get past them!"
Sandy says: "Not to worry!"
Sandy says: "We'll be in disguise."
They both walk outside the dome whistling as they walk up to a Jellien Clone.
Sandy says: "Greetings, fellow clone."
Sandy says: "I hate mayonnaise."
SpongeBob says: "I hate mayonnaise and mustard."
Jellien Fred says: "Hmm..."
SpongeBob and Sandy both walk off whistling.
Jellien Fred says: "I like mustard!"
They both walk into the Krusty Krab and meet up with Jellien Mr. Krabs.
Jellien Mr. Krabs says: "Did you take that nap, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh huh!"
SpongeBob says: "Sure did!"
Sandy says: "Yep."
Sandy says: "We're all rested and jelly-fied."
SpongeBob says: "Good one, Jellien Sandy."
Jellien Mr. Krabs says: "Imposters!"
All of the Jellien Clones in the Krusty Krab begin hissing and surrounding SpongeBob and Sandy.
Sandy says: "SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "The mayonnaise!"
Jellien Mr. Krabs says: "Ah!"
Sandy says: "It worked, SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "Keep going!"
SpongeBob says: "."
Sandy says: "SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "Look out!"
All of the Jellien Clones begin to close in to which SpongeBob squirts and destroys all of them. SpongeBob and Sandy then head towards the back running past Jellien Patrick.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hi, Jellien Patrick!"
Jellien Patrick says: "Hold the mayonnaise!"
SpongeBob says: "D'oh!"
SpongeBob says: "Almost forgot!"
Patrick says: "Oh..."
SpongeBob and Sandy enter the freezer to confront the Overlord.
Sandy says: "Hold it right there, you evil blob of slime!"
Sandy says: "You're through 'cause we know your weakness!"
Sandy says: "Show 'em, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob shows the Overlord the jug of mayonnaise. The Overlord then roars loudly telling the Jelliens to attack SpongeBob and Sandy.
Sandy says: "Let 'er rip!"
SpongeBob says: "Nah!"
SpongeBob says: "Gasp!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "It's so cold in here the mayonnaise is starting to freeze!"
Sandy says: "Then hurry and throw it, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Aye, aye!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh no!"
SpongeBob says: "This mayonnaise is frozen solid!"
SpongeBob says: "Hooray!"
Sandy says: "Hooray!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What happened?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, let me tell ya!"
Frenchy says: "Eleven minutes later..."
SpongeBob says: "And that's why we're covered in goo!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Thanks for rescuing us, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "But what are we going to do with all of this green slop?"
Patrick says: "Mmm!"
Patrick says: "Freaky Clone Jelly Relish!"
Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab again.
Mr. Krabs says: "Relish Patties!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get your Freaky Clone Jelly Relish Patties!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Only four bucks extra!"
Patrick says: "Uh, I'll have one Relish Patty."
Patrick says: "Hold the mayo."
SpongeBob looks suspiciously at Patrick with the next time card saying "The End?", ending the episode.
