Gary is snoring until the alarm horn blows. SpongeBob's blanket flies off but reveals a box for SpongeBob's body, a fork for the nose, and two potatoes for the feet.
SpongeBob says: "Nice try, "alarmy," but you've got to get up pretty early to wake me up on "picture day!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Now, if you'll excuse me, Gary, I must go make myself picturesque."
SpongeBob says: "Perfect!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm ready."
SpongeBob says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "I'm ready, again!"
Gary says: "Meow?"
SpongeBob says: "It's time to take a corrective approach."

Harold says: "Take cover!"
Harold says: "The teenagers, they've been let out of school and they're pelting us with balloons filled with..."
SpongeBob says: "Ketchup?"
Harold says: "Save yourself, kid!"
Teenager says: "Gotcha!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait, wait, don't squirt!"
SpongeBob says: "Please, you've got to spare me."
SpongeBob says: "I've got picture day today."
Teenager says: "Oh, pictures, huh?"
Teenager says: "Well, let me help you with your makeup, HAH!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I'm not sure how I did it, but I..."
Old Man says: "Fiddlesticks, missed again."
SpongeBob says: "And now, as an extra precaution to keep me looking shiny and new..."
Patrick says: "Hey, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, a little privacy here."
Patrick says: "Oh, sorry, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "I just came over to borrow some jelly."
SpongeBob says: "Well, go ahead, but I don't have time to play right now."
SpongeBob says: "I am late for picture day, and I just can't seem to get to school without being covered by unsightly debris."
SpongeBob says: "If only I had a sealed barrier to protect me from the filth of the outside world."
Patrick says: "I have a solution."
SpongeBob says: "Ew!"
Patrick says: "Ah."
Patrick says: "I have solved my hunger problem."
SpongeBob says: "That's it!"
Patrick says: "We're here."
Patrick says: "Hey, what did I bring jelly for?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, Patrick..."
Patrick says: "Oh, yeah."
Patrick says: "I was gonna put it on this peanut butter taco."
SpongeBob says: "No, no, no, no, no, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm not jelly, I'm not jelly!"
Patrick says: "Huh?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, get out of my taco!"
Patrick says: "What's the matter, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I just wanted to take a decent picture today because someday, I will graduate from Boating School and I don't want to be remembered as the guy covered in peanut butter and taco shells!"

Photographer says: "Say cheese."
SpongeBob says: "Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese!"
Photographer says: "Quit that moody brooding."
Photographer says: "This will clean you up."
Mrs. Puff says: "SpongeBob, please stop crying so he can take the picture."

Photographer says: "Puff."
Photographer says: "I brought Pearlie."
SpongeBob says: "I can't stop crying!"
Photographer says: "Say cheese."
SpongeBob says: "Cheese."
