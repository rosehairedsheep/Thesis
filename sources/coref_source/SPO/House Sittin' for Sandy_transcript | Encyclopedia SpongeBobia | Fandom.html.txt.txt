Sandy says: "Eureka, it worked!"
Sandy says: "The experiment is a success."
SpongeBob says: "Experiment?"
Patrick says: "Experiment?"
Sandy says: "That's right, boys."
Sandy says: "I wanted you to destroy my home all along so I can test this out this here rubble reverse ray blaster on some genuine rubble."
Sandy says: "I could've just smashed all this stuff up myself, but nobody destroys stuff up quite like y'all."
Sandy says: "You're not a failure SpongeBob, you're a scientist!"
Patrick says: "Hooray!"
SpongeBob says: "Hooray!"
