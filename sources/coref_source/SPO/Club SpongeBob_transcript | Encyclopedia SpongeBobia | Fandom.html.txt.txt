Scene starts with Squidward leaving his house on a bicycle while he hums a tune.
Squidward says: "There's my hat..."
Squidward says: "and there's that, and here we go."
SpongeBob says: "Wey, wook."
SpongeBob says: "It's Widward!"
Squidward says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "Widward's woing to work."
Patrick says: "Where does he work?"
Patrick says: "Wat the Wusty Wab?"
Squidward says: "What's that supposed to be?"
Squidward says: "Some kind of stupid secret code?"
SpongeBob says: "We can't tell you 'cause you're not a member of the club."
Squidward says: "Oh, yeah?"
Squidward says: "What does it take to be a member, besides being a moron?"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Squidward, but you couldn't get in even if you tried!"
Squidward says: "Huh?"
Squidward says: "Well, I'll have you know that I am a member of over 20 different exclusive clubs all across the sea bottom!"
Patrick says: "What did he say?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know."
SpongeBob says: "Something about his nose?"
Patrick says: "Squidward, you and your nose will definitely not fit in!"
Squidward says: "Oh, what do you two zeros know about fitting in?"
Squidward says: "Why, you should be begging me to join!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, no, no, no!"
Patrick says: "Squidward, no, no, no!"
SpongeBob says: "Stop!"
Patrick says: "Stop!"
SpongeBob says: "No, no, no, stop, please, please!"
Patrick says: "No, no, no, stop, please, please!"
SpongeBob says: "Stop, Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Stop, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "You can't join!"
Patrick says: "You can't join!"
SpongeBob says: "You can't join!"
Patrick says: "You can't join!"
SpongeBob says: "Can't join!"
Patrick says: "Can't join!"
SpongeBob says: "You can't get in!"
Patrick says: "You can't get in!"
Squidward grunts as he tries to get in the "Clubhouse".
Squidward says: "Well, this is stupid."
Squidward says: "There's no room up here!"
Patrick says: "That's what we've been trying to tell you!"
SpongeBob says: "We've been stuck up here for three days."
Patrick says: "We told you you wouldn't fit in."
SpongeBob says: "Well, since you're here, Squidward, we'll give you the new member initiation."
SpongeBob says: "Are you ready, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Ready!"
SpongeBob says: "Welcome to our club!"
Patrick says: "Welcome to our club!"
SpongeBob says: "Welcome to our club!"
Patrick says: "Welcome to our club!"
SpongeBob says: "Welcome Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Welcome Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Welcome Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Welcome Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Welcome Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Welcome Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Welcome Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Welcome Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Welcome Squid..."
Patrick says: "Welcome Squid..."
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "!"
Squidward says: "Shut your half-wit pieholes!"
Nancy says: "Whoa!"
Frank says: "Make a wish, honey."
Squidward continues screaming. The "Clubhouse" falls into the Kelp Forest.
SpongeBob says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Patrick says: "Whoo-hoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoo-hoo-hoo!"
Patrick says: "Whoo-hoo-hoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoo!"
Patrick says: "Whoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoo!"
Patrick says: "Whoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoo!"
Patrick says: "Whoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoo!"
Patrick says: "Whoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Again!"
Patrick says: "Again!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah!"
Patrick says: "Oh, yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Again!"
Patrick says: "Again!"
Squidward says: "Oh, no."
Squidward says: "That didn't just happen."
Squidward says: "Please tell me that didn't happen!"
Patrick says: "What happened?"
SpongeBob shrugs. Squidward runs around the "Clubhouse".
Squidward says: "Where are we?"
Squidward says: "We're lost!"
Squidward says: "There's no way out!"
Squidward says: "Stuck..."
Squidward says: "in the middle of nowhere..."
Squidward says: "with SpongeBob and Patrick!"
SpongeBob and Patrick wave at Squidward who starts crying.
Squidward says: "Oh, why must every 11 minutes of my life be filled with misery?"
Squidward says: "Why-y-y-y?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, cheer up, Squid."
SpongeBob says: "It could be worse."
Patrick says: "Yeah."
Patrick says: "You could be bald and have a big nose."
Squidward says: "Well..."
Squidward says: "this is the end."
SpongeBob says: "No, it's not, Squidward."
Patrick says: "It's not?"
SpongeBob says: "Come on, guys, we're gonna be fine!"
SpongeBob says: "As long as we stick together."
SpongeBob says: "Remember, we're a club!"
SpongeBob says: "And besides, we have this!"
Squidward says: "What's that?"
Patrick says: "Ohhh!"
Patrick says: "The Magic Conch Shell!"
Patrick says: "Ask it something!"
Patrick says: "Ask it something!"
SpongeBob says: "Magic Conch Shell, will I ever get married?"
Magic Conch says: "Maybe someday."
SpongeBob says: "Oooohhhh!"
Patrick says: "Oooohhhh!"
Squidward says: "You've got to be kidding!"
Squidward says: "That is just a stupid toy!"
Squidward says: "How can that possibly help us?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch."
SpongeBob says: "The club always takes its advice before we do anything."
Patrick says: "The shell knows all!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Magic Conch Shell, what do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest?"
Magic Conch says: "Nothing."
Patrick says: "The shell has spoken!"
Squidward says: "Nothing?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "We can't just sit here and do nothing!"
SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting down doing nothing.
Squidward says: "I can't believe you two are gonna take advice from a toy!"
SpongeBob and Patrick still do nothing.
Scooter says: "Dude, we're falling right out of the sky!"
Scooter says: "We gotta drop the load!"
SpongeBob says: "Praise the Magic Conch!"
Patrick says: "Praise the Magic Conch!"
Squidward says: "Uh, hey, uh, SpongeBob..."
Squidward says: "that sure is a lot of food you got there."
SpongeBob says: "It's a gift from the Magic Conch."
Squidward says: "Everything sure looks delicious."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Umm..."
Squidward says: "uh..."
Squidward says: "yeah?"
SpongeBob says: "Once a member, always a member!"
Squidward says: "Yeah."
Squidward says: "All right..."
Squidward says: "What shall I eat first?"
Squidward says: "The spaghetti, the turkey, the soup, the canned meat?"
SpongeBob says: "Why don't you ask..."
SpongeBob says: "the Magic Conch, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Oh, yeah, like that'll happen."
Squidward says: "Right after I consult the Magic Toenail."
Squidward prepares to eat but SpongeBob and Patrick pull the table away and block it.
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, are you questioning the authority of the Magic Conch?"
SpongeBob says: "The conch is the one who gave us this banquet."
SpongeBob says: "This copyrighted conch is the cornerstone of our organization."
Patrick says: "Maybe he's not a brother."
SpongeBob looks at Squidward wide-eyed.
Squidward says: "Uh, hello there."
Squidward says: "Magic Conch, uh, I was wondering..."
Squidward says: "uh, should I have the spaghetti or the turkey?"
Magic Conch says: "Neither."
Squidward says: "Oh, then how about the soup?"
Magic Conch says: "I don't think so."
Squidward says: "Could I have anything to eat?"
Magic Conch says: "No."
Squidward says: "No?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "What do you mean no?"
Squidward says: "I'm starving here!"
Patrick says: "Here, let me try."
Patrick says: "Magic Conch, could Squidward have some of this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?"
Magic Conch says: "No."
Patrick says: "Hmm..."
Patrick says: "Could I have this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?"
Magic Conch says: "Yes."
Patrick says: "All right!"
Patrick says: "Sorry, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Give me that!"
Squidward says: "Could I have something to eat?"
Magic Conch says: "No."
Squidward says: "Could I have something to eat?"
Magic Conch says: "No."
Squidward says: "Could I have something to eat?"
Magic Conch says: "No."
Squidward says: "Can't you say anything else but no?"
Magic Conch says: "Try asking again."
Squidward says: "Can I have something to eat?"
Magic Conch says: "No."
Squidward starts getting enraged.
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, are you all right?"
Squidward shakes his head uncontrollably.
Patrick says: "Maybe we should ask the shell if he's okay."
Kelp Forest Ranger says: "Do you folks need some help?"
Squidward says: "You don't know how happy I am to see you."
Squidward says: "I have been stranded out here for weeks with-with-with these two barnacle heads and their Magic Conch Shell!"
Kelp Forest Ranger says: "Magic..."
Kelp Forest Ranger says: "Conch Shell?"
SpongeBob says: "The Magic Conch!"
Patrick says: "The Magic Conch!"
SpongeBob says: "A club member!"
Patrick says: "A club member!"
Squidward says: "Abra."
Kelp Forest Ranger says: "My conch told me to come save you guys."
SpongeBob says: "Hooray for the magic conches!"
Patrick says: "Hooray for the magic conches!"
Kelp Forest Ranger says: "Hooray for the magic conches!"
Kelp Forest Ranger says: "All right, Magic Conch..."
Kelp Forest Ranger says: "what do we do now?"
Magic Conch says: "Nothing."
SpongeBob says: "All hail the Magic Conch!"
Patrick says: "All hail the Magic Conch!"
Kelp Forest Ranger says: "All hail the Magic Conch!"
Squidward says: "All hail the magic conch!"
