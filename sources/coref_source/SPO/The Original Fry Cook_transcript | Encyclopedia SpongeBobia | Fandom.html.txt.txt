At the Krusty Krab.
Old Man Jenkins says: "I just can't decide what to order."
Squidward says: "You already ordered."
Old Man Jenkins says: "Don't rush me, young lady!"
Squidward says: "Hurry up, SpongeBob!"
Back in the kitchen, SpongeBob is filling in a ketchup heart on a Krabby Patty.
Squidward says: "What is taking you so long?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm adding the love!"
Squidward says: "You're not being paid to love."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I'm not here for the money."
SpongeBob says: "I'll always treasure these moments we had together."
Squidward says: "Look!"
He points to the outside, where a solid gold limousine pulls up to the Krusty Krab. Everyone gasps, then runs out to the limo, knocking over and walking over SpongeBob. When SpongeBob lifts his head, to his great disappointment, he sees his burger is trampled with a big footprint in the middle.
SpongeBob says: "Awww..."
Back outside, a security guard opens the limo door for someone.
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, I'll be cooked in butter!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's Jim, the Original Fry Cook!"
Out of the limo steps a bald, overweight, blue fish wearing a fast food cap and a yellow shirt. He walks into the Krusty Krab.
Jim says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "The Jim?"
SpongeBob says: "He who flipped patties in the before time?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're doin' well, Jim."
Mr. Krabs says: "Is that limo solid gold?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Jim says: "It sure is."
Jim says: "I was on my way to my solid gold mansion next to my solid gold lake, when I thought I'd take a trip down memory lane."
Squidward says: "Good ol' Jim."
Squidward says: "When you worked here, the place had class."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
SpongeBob says: "When this place had class..."
SpongeBob says: "Well, we've had some good times, too."
SpongeBob says: "Right, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "No."
Jim walks up to the "Employee of the Month" wall.
Jim says: "Hey, that's new."
Jim says: ""Employee of the Month," huh?"
SpongeBob says: "That's me!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't worry, Jim."
Mr. Krabs says: "No one could ever replace you."
Mr. Krabs says: "The original is still underneath."
He punches the wall and all of SpongeBob's pictures fall on him and break. Underneath is a giant photo of Jim.
Mr. Krabs says: "Your "Best Employee Ever" award!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Sweep up this mess while Jim and I catch up."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, sir."
Mr. Krabs and Jim sit at a table and talk about their lives.
Jim says: "After I left The Krusty Krab I worked at some of the finest restaurants around the world."
Jim says: "I got so successful, I was able to retire in luxury."
SpongeBob says: "Would you sign my Krabby Patty?"
Shows him the smashed patty from earlier.
Jim says: "Oh, I..."
Jim says: "Don't sign what I didn't make."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, bigshot!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why don't you step behind the fryer for old time's sake?"
Jim says: "You're on, Krabs!"
Jim says: "But I'll have to charge you!"
Mr. Krabs laughs hysterically while Jim grins and sips his soda.
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, you always knew how to make me laugh."
Mr. Krabs says: "You just don't find employees like that anymore."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah..."
SpongeBob says: "not unless you look right in front of you!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're right, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "I appreciate you, Squidward!"
Scene shows Squidward walking by with a wet toilet plunger in hand.
Squidward says: "Now I feel complete!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now how about that patty?"
Jim says: "Everyone, watch and learn!"
Everyone gathers at the kitchen doorway as Jim enters, but the door closes and Jim's bodyguards block it.
Bodyguard #1 says: "No one watches Jim."
Jim rings the bell and holds out a burger through the ordering window.
Jim says: "One patty!"
Jim says: "The right way."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's a thing of beauty!"
SpongeBob says: "What's so great about a Jim Patty anyway?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Jim, sir?"
Jim says: "Oh, hey!"
Jim says: "You..."
Jim says: "You're the guy..."
Jim says: "who sweeps up, right?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm the new fry cook, sir."
Jim says: "Oh!"
Jim says: "You made that..."
Jim says: "stepped-on thing I saw earlier, right?"
SpongeBob says: "Do you have any tips you can pass on to a rookie?"
Jim says: "Besides don't step on the food?"
SpongeBob says: "Please critique my work!"
SpongeBob says: "I wish to learn at the feet of the master!"
Jim says: "Now that's the way to grovel."
Jim says: "I'll do it!"
Jim says: "The pickle slices were too thick."
SpongeBob grills another one, and flips it into the air, and struggles to somehow make it levitate until Jim says to stop.
Jim says: "Hold it..."
Jim says: "Hold it..."
Jim says: "Hold it..."
Jim says: "Okay."
Later, as SpongeBob is finished crafting the Krabby Patty, Jim steps on it and lifts his foot, covered in mustard.
Jim says: "Now, too much mustard, see?"
SpongeBob takes his finger and licks some off. Cut to SpongeBob making more patties, Jim taste testing them, and then flushing them. Eventually, the toilet gets so full, that it backs up. After trying to flush the patties down the toilet, SpongeBob runs out of the stall, crying. Martin approaching the stall sees this.
Martin says: "Oh, man!"
SpongeBob says: "Am I a fraud?"
He cries, and Squidward knocks on the door.
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, what are you doing in there?"
SpongeBob says: "Crying my eyes out."
Squidward says: "Well, hurry up."
Squidward says: "I gotta cry, too."
SpongeBob says: "Why, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Because when Jim leaves, I'll be stuck with you again!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Jim won't be leaving."
SpongeBob says: "He's taking my job."
SpongeBob says: "I'm the one who's leaving!"
SpongeBob bursts into tears.
Squidward says: "Really?"
Squidward says: "Yes!"
Squidward says: "Ha, cha-cha!"
Squidward says: "Ha, cha-cha!"
Squidward says: "Ha, cha-cha!"
Squidward says: "Whoo-hoo-hoo!"
Squidward says: "Hee, hee, Ha!"
Squidward says: "Ha!"
SpongeBob walks into the bathroom and sits on a pile of waterlogged patties.
SpongeBob says: "The Krusty Krab deserves better than my meager skills."
SpongeBob says: "I should be professional."
SpongeBob says: "I must..."
SpongeBob says: "resign."
SpongeBob says: ""Dear Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs,..."
Later, he walks out of the bathroom to see a crowd towards the front of the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs says: "Three cheers for the world's greatest fry cook..."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Me?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Come here."
Mr. Krabs says: "Help us cheer for Jim."
All But Mr. Krabs says: "Hip, hip, Hooray!"
Squidward says: "Hip, hip, Hooray!"
SpongeBob runs into the kitchen.
SpongeBob says: "Goodbye, grill."
SpongeBob says: "Goodbye, pot."
SpongeBob says: "Goodbye, pan."
SpongeBob says: "So long, fry fat."
SpongeBob says: "Goodbye, grease stain."
SpongeBob says: "Goodbye, frozen patty #1."
SpongeBob says: "Goodbye, frozen patty #2."
Narrator says: "298 frozen patties later..."
SpongeBob says: "Goodbye, freezer."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob's resignation?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, this is terrible!"
Mr. Krabs says: "No one's making patties!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And that mean I'm not making money!"
Jim walks in.
Jim says: "Hey, Eugene, where's that little fry cook of yours?"
Mr. Krabs says: "He thinks you're taking his job, so he's run off!"
Jim says: "Hey, great idea!"
Jim says: "And you can give me a raise!"
They laugh over their own little joke, and SpongeBob watches from the freezer window.
SpongeBob says: "Look at them."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs is probably offering Jim my job right now."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, I better go find him."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I was just leaving."
SpongeBob says: "I'm not fit to inhabit the same kitchen as Jim."
SpongeBob says: "So it is with a heavy heart that I relinquish my position as fry cook."
Jim says: "What are you thinking, SpongeBob?"
Jim says: "I'm not taking your job."
SpongeBob says: "But you're the greatest fry cook in the world!"
SpongeBob says: "The Krusty Krab deserves better than me."
Jim says: "Both those statements are true, SpongeBob, but there's a reason I left the Krusty Krab."
Jim says: "It all started on a warm summer evening."
Jim says: "Business was slow, so Squidward and I were having one of our famous bull sessions."
Jim says: "We should open our own restaurant and stop relying on old man K's pockets."
Squidward says: "No, thanks."
Squidward says: "I'm just doing this until my clarinet career takes off."
Jim says: "What if it never does?"
Jim says: "Don't you wanna have something to fall back on?"
Squidward says: "Yeah!"
Squidward says: "Ha!"
Squidward says: "I could lose my beautiful, flowing hair, too, but I'm not buying a wig yet."
His hair disintegrates and falls out of his head instantly.
Jim says: "Well, while you go wig shopping, I'm gonna go talk to Mr."
Jim says: "Krabs."
Jim says: "Hey, Mr."
Jim says: "Krabs, you gotta second?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Anything for you, Jimmy, me boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Cop a squat and lay your wreck and tell me what's on your wig, Jim."
Jim says: "Cut the gas, Krabs, and dig this: I've been bustin' my conk for you."
Jim says: "You better lay on some extra gravy, or I'm going to agitate the gravel."
Mr. Krabs says: "What now?"
Jim says: "You know, lay a patch."
Mr. Krabs says: "'Scuse me?"
Jim says: "Give me a raise, or I'm quitting."
Mr. Krabs says: "A raise?"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's not in my "Hiptionary"."
Mr. Krabs says: "Help me get with it, Jack."
Jim says: "Stop talking like that."
Mr. Krabs says: "These sideburns aren't real."
Mr. Krabs rips them off.
Jim says: "I need more money in my paycheck at the end of every week, capiche?"
Mr. Krabs starts laughing uncontrollably. When he doesn't stop, Jim leaves, not stopping to listen to Squidward's complaints about his hair.
Squidward says: "My hair!"
Squidward says: "My beautiful hair!"
Squidward says: "My hair!"
Squidward says: "My hair!"
End of flashback, and the scene is back to the modern day Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs is still laughing.
Mr. Krabs says: "Aye, it's still as funny today as it was then."
Scene cuts to Squidward crying and sighing over his bald head.
Mr. Krabs says: "You see, SpongeBob, you've got one quality Jim will never have: you're cheap!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "I never thought about it that way!"
Mr. Krabs says: "So, you'll stay?"
SpongeBob says: "Aye, aye, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Then back to work!"
SpongeBob runs off the screen.
Jim says: "Well, Eugene, looks like you've got yourself another sucker."
Jim says: "The kid's a good fry cook, but he'll only be a great fry cook when he finally gets the guts to quit this dump."
Jim says: "Good luck, SpongeBob."
Jim says: "You're gonna need it."
SpongeBob says: "The Krusty Krab isn't a dump."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, she's a dump, alright."
Mr. Krabs says: "But she's my dump."
SpongeBob says: "Oh."
