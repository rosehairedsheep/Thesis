Mr. Krabs says: "Cabbage, green backs, money!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, you mean your obsession."
Mr. Krabs says: "Obsession is kind of a strong word."
Plankton climbs out of the pickle jar and opens a fake pickle, which contains a plunger launching device. He assembles it and shoots it at the wall above the safe, then climbs the rope, lowers himself onto the combination spinner and spins it by running on the top of the dial.
Plankton says: "35 left, 25 right, and finally, 4 left."
Plankton says: "Open, says me!"
Plankton says: "Hey, what gives?"
Plankton says: "I was looking right at the combination, why isn't it opening?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, what was that rule about dropped food?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Was it 5 seconds or 5 minutes or..."
Mr. Krabs says: "ah, well."
Mr. Krabs says: "Waste not, whnt not."

In the Chum Bucket.
Karen says: "Plankton, where have you been?!"
Karen says: "!"
Plankton says: "Trust me, you do not want to know."
Karen says: "Did you get the Krabby Patty formula?"
Karen says: "Like I have to ask."
Plankton says: "No, and I probably never will."
Karen says: "You need a more positive outlook!"
Plankton says: "Oh, Karen, if only you could just see things way I do."
Karen says: "Plankton!"
Plankton says: "What?"
Karen says: "I think you hit it!"
Karen says: "You couldn't see the correct combination because you have only one eye."
Karen says: "You lack depth perception."
Plankton says: "Maybe you're right."
Plankton says: "That would explain why I stink at darts."
Karen says: "What you need is a second eye."
Plankton says: "Karen, my dear, I think you're on to something."
Plankton says: "Looks like it's time for an upgrade!"
Plankton presses a button. A machine covers him then retracts. An eye appears on the side of Plankton's head.

Plankton says: "Karen, what am I doing wrong?"
Karen says: "Your experiments are missing essential one ingredient."
Plankton says: "It's not love, is it?"
Plankton says: "â€˜Cause you know I hate that stuff."
Karen says: "No, it's cells from another eye."
Karen says: "Even a single teardrop would contain enough DNA."
Plankton says: "Tears, huh?"
Plankton says: "I guess if I have to."
Plankton says: "Will these do?"
Karen says: "No, silly."
Karen says: "They have to be from somebody who already has two eyes."
Plankton says: "Two eyes, huh?"
Plankton says: "I think I know a crybaby who fits that description!"
Cut to SpongeBob setting up a picnic.
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Plankton!"

SpongeBob says: "No, not particularly."

Plankton says: "But unfortunately for said doofus, his milk was tragically spilt."
Plankton says: "The end."
Plankton says: "Get a grip!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I guess Plankton's right."
SpongeBob says: "Good thing I always bring backup milk!"
Karen says: "Are you sure you want to go through with this?"
Plankton says: "Yes, let's hurry up and get it over with!"

SpongeBob says: "La la la la!"
Plankton says: "Hi, SpongeBob, great to see you, buddy!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Plankton, whatcha doing?"
Plankton says: "I thought I was going to steal something."
Plankton says: "Can't imagine why."
Plankton says: "So, I'm just enjoying this lovely day!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, buh-bye!"
Plankton walks back into the Chum Bucket with an ice cream and a balloon.
Plankton says: "Honey, I'm home!"
Karen says: "Oh, you're a happy camper."
Karen says: "Did you finally steal the formula?"
Plankton says: "Formula, what formula?"
Plankton says: "I forgot the formula!"
Plankton says: "I can't imagine what got into me."
Karen says: "It's that new eye of yours."
Karen says: "Your evil DNA has become corrupted by SpongeBob's nice DNA."
Karen says: "You've gone from evil.."
Karen says: "To neevil!"
Karen says: "You're becoming as harmless as that fry cook."
Plankton says: "Nonsense, You're imagining things."
Karen says: "Oh, really?"
Karen says: "Let's test it, shall we?"
Karen says: "Tell me what you see in these ink blots."
Plankton says: "Hmm."
Plankton says: "Looks like a pretty butterfly!"
Karen says: "Nope."
Karen says: "Try again."
Karen says: "What does this remind you of?"
Plankton says: "Aww, it's a little puppy doggy!"
Karen says: "Try this!"
Plankton says: "Uhh..."
Karen says: "I'll give you a hint."
Plankton says: "A bouquet of flowers!"
Plankton says: "Would you like some flowers, honey?"
Karen says: "Cells from that sponge have changed your whole point of view."
Plankton says: "Ah, a few blobs of ink doesn't prove a thing."
Plankton says: "I'm as evil as ever, I'll prove it right now by stealing the Krabby Patty secret formula."
A building is on fire and citizens are screaming; Bubble Bass is trapped on the top floor, waving his arms.
Plankton says: "Such lovely destruction!"
Bubble Bass says: "Help!"
Bubble Bass says: "Save me!"
Bubble Bass says: "Save me!"
Plankton says: "I'll help you!"
Plankton says: "Do not worry, citizen, I'll catch you!"
Bubble Bass says: "Comin' down."
Plankton says: "Oh no."
Bubble Bass says: "Thanks, buddy!"
Plankton says: "Unbelievable!"
Plankton says: "I've committed another selfless act."
Plankton says: "This eye is taking over!"
Plankton says: "But I must stay strong and concentrate on swiping the Krabby Patty formula."
Plankton says: "What's this?"
Plankton says: "It's the Krabby Patty formula!"
Plankton says: "Uh-wha.."
Plankton says: "Krabs must have lost it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And that's why your promotion means a 50% cut in salary, understand, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, sir, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Plankton says: "Hey, Eugene!"
Plankton says: "You missing anything?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Me Krabby Patty Formula!"
Plankton says: "That's right, Krabs."
Plankton says: "Unbelievably, I found it lying on the ground!"
Plankton says: "So I'm giving it back to you, take it."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Something smells and it isn't my long johns."
Mr. Krabs says: "Let's see here, you had the formula, why didn't you run off with it?"
Plankton says: "Why didn't I run off with it?"
Plankton says: "Why didn't I run off with it?"
Plankton says: "Because that would be stealing!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Since when do you care about stealing?"
Plankton says: "Oh, it's this cursed new eye!"
Plankton says: "I've got to get rid of it!"
Plankton says: "Must become monocular again."
Mr. Krabs says: "You know, I don't think I trust this nice, polite, pleasant Plankton."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I think Plankton has really changed."
SpongeBob says: "He just needs some encouragement, and I know just how to do it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh-huh."
Show Plankton returning to the Chum Bucket while struggling to fix his eyes, stumbles through the door and sits in the dark.

Everybody says: "Surprise!"
Plankton says: "The Chum Bucket's been invaded."

SpongeBob says: "This isn't an invasion, we're here to show you how much we appreciate all the good deeds you've done lately."
SpongeBob says: "We came to give a great big hug!"
Plankton says: "What, no!"
Plankton says: "Not hugs!"
Plankton says: "It's gone."
Plankton says: "That disgustingly good eye is finally gone!"
Plankton says: "I'm cured!"
Plankton says: "Thank you, thank you all!"
Plankton says: "Especially you, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, glad I could help."
Plankton says: "Yes, thanks to you I'm evil again, and as a token of my appreciation, I'll give you all a rousing send-off with my infra-red security attack lasers!"
