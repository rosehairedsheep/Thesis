Patrick says: "Oh, thanks, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Sure, Patrick, ya..."
Patrick says: "I gotta get going!"
Patrick says: "He told me to!"
SpongeBob says: "Who did?"
Patrick says: "Uhh, well, uhh..."
Patrick says: "hmmm, I'm not sure."
Patrick says: "But he had a briefcase."
SpongeBob says: "Ahh, a briefcase?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "He might be a paid assassin!"
Patrick says: "It'll have to be one of your other chums 'cause my mind is set."
SpongeBob says: "Unset it, please unset it!"
Patrick says: "I guess I'll pack up my stuff and get ready to go."
Patrick says: "My clothes."
SpongeBob says: "Umm, Patrick, those are my clothes."
Patrick says: "My peanut butter!"
SpongeBob says: "That's my peanut butter."
Patrick says: "And my pickles!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't believe you're leaving, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "With all my pickles!"
Patrick says: "It's the end of me being here."
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Stop!"
SpongeBob says: "What about all our plans?"
SpongeBob says: "8:00am - Wake up Patrick, 9:00am - Eat Kelpo with Patrick, 10:00am - Brush teeth with Patrick, 1:00pm - Stare at Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Who's gonna do all that with me?"
Patrick says: "I'm sorry, there's no stopping the unstoppable."
Patrick says: "Patrick Star will live no more, forever..."
Patrick says: "in Bikini Bottom."
SpongeBob says: "But..."
SpongeBob says: "what if you weren't Patrick Star?"
Patrick says: "Oh, no."
Patrick says: "I'm not Patrick Star?"
SpongeBob says: "You are Patrick Star, but you won't be for long."
Patrick says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "There ya go, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "No one will know it's you."
Larry says: "Hey guys!"
Larry says: "Yo, Patrick, cool shades."
SpongeBob says: "Well, Pat, that disguise didn't work."
SpongeBob says: "We're gonna have to try harder."
Patrick says: "Goodbye seaweed."
SpongeBob says: "Too bad we couldn't come up with a better costume."
SpongeBob says: "Hmmm..."
Patrick says: "Goodbye sky."
SpongeBob says: "That's it."
SpongeBob says: "With the seaweed on your head, you could be a..."
Patrick says: "Oh, I know, I know!"
Patrick says: "I could be Mr."
Patrick says: "Seaweed Monsterman."
Patrick says: "And live happily forever after in Bikini Bottom."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, there already is a Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Seaweed Monsterman."
Seaweed Monsterman says: "Hey!"
Patrick says: "Darn!"
SpongeBob says: "It's okay, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "So you can't be a monster."
SpongeBob says: "But that vegetation on your head gives me an idea of what you can be."
Fish #2 says: "Hi, SpongeBob."
Fish #2 says: "And hello, lady."
SpongeBob says: "The disguise is working, Patrick..."
SpongeBob says: "I mean, Patricia."
Larry says: "SpongeBob, you never told me you had a girlfriend."
Patrick says: "Oh, I'm not his girlfriend."
Patrick says: "I'm Pat..."
Larry says: "Bro, your girlfriend is not ugly."
SpongeBob says: "Actually, Larry, she's not my girlfriend, she's just a..."
Larry says: "It's cool, buddy."
Larry says: "You don't have to explain your girlfriend to me."
SpongeBob says: "But she's not my girlfriend."
Larry says: "I don't know why you're standing here talking to me when you could be talking to your girlfriend."
SpongeBob says: "C'mon, Patricia."
Patricia says: "Bye."
Larry says: "Congratulations on the new girlfriend, dude!"
SpongeBob says: "But, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, the Krusty Krab doesn't open for another two hours."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, who's your friend?"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, this is Patricia."
Mr. Krabs says: "Patricia."
Mr. Krabs says: "The most beautiful sound I've ever seen."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, do we need any more help down at the Krusty Krab?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
Mr. Krabs says: "We do?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Great, she can start right away."
Squidward says: "He-  And who are you, my rubenesque beauty?"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's Patricia, our newest Krusty Krab employee."
Squidward says: "Well, she sure is stunning."
Squidward says: "Hi, Patricia."
Squidward says: "I drew this for you."
Patricia says: "Uhh, thank you, Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "Order up, Miss Patricia."
Patricia says: "Excuse me, Squidward."
Patricia says: "Forty..."
Patricia says: "thirty..."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's a 7, Patricia."
Patricia says: "Mr."
Patricia says: "Krabs, you ordered two Krusty meals?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I guess you'll just have to help me finish all this food."
Patricia says: "Okay."
Mr. Krabs says: "Patricia, we may have only known each other for a short time, now, but I feel like a special connection has been made."
SpongeBob says: "Quite an appetite, but she's all woman."
Squidward says: "Eh?"
Squidward says: "Ya know, Patricia, they don't call me the 'Sizzle Lips Squid' for nothing."
Squidward says: "So, are you free this Saturday night?"
Patricia says: "No, that's the night SpongeBob and I are having a staring contest."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, now that we're alone, how would you like to be my date Friday night to a..."
Patricia says: "Well, I can't."
Patricia says: "SpongeBob and I will be flying submarines that night."
Patricia says: "I have to get back to Krusting the Krab."
Squidward says: "Are you sure about Saturday night?"
Patricia says: "Persistent bunch."
Mr. Krabs says: "How about Sunday brunch?"
Patricia says: "No thanks, again!"
Squidward says: "But I made reservations for two at..."
Patricia says: "I said no."
Patricia says: "What is it about me that makes those two so friendly?"
Patricia says: "It must have something to do with this disguise."
Patricia says: "I can't wear this any longer."
SpongeBob says: "But if you reveal your secret identity, you'll have to leave Bikini Bottom!"
Patricia says: "Well, I'm sorry, SpongeBob."
Patricia says: "I just can't live like this anymore."
Patricia says: "I'm tired of pretending to be someone I'm not."
Fancy dandy fish says: "The lovely Patricia  has returned to us!"
Patricia says: "I have an announcement to make."
Patricia says: "The entire day that I've worked here I've wanted to say..."
Customers says: "Huh?"
Sunny Seashores Salesfish says: "Ahoy, waitress, aren't you gonna take my order?"
Patricia says: "I'll be right there, sir."
SpongeBob says: "What's the matter, Patrick?"
Patricia says: "That's the guy with the briefcase."
Patricia says: "The guy who's trying to run me out of town."
SpongeBob says: "The assassin!"
Patricia says: "What can I get you, sir?"
Sunny Seashores Salesfish says: "Say, don't I know you from somewhere?"
Patricia says: "No!"
Sunny Seashores Salesfish says: "Hmmm..."
Sunny Seashores Salesfish says: "that's it!"
Sunny Seashores Salesfish says: "Get outta town!"
Patricia says: "He's onto us."
SpongeBob says: "I won't let you do it."
SpongeBob says: "You'll have to do something horrible to me before I let you throw Patrick out of town."
Squidward says: "Patrick?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Patrick?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Sunny Seashores Salesfish says: "You forgot your flyer."
SpongeBob says: ""Get outta town!"
SpongeBob says: "To beautiful Sunny Seashores Resort."
SpongeBob says: "" Look, this guy wasn't trying to run you out of town, he just wanted to sell you a luxury vacation at a modest price."
Patricia says: "Well, I guess I don't need this disguise anymore."
Squidward says: "Umm, I think I need to take a shower."
Mr. Krabs says: "So, let me get this straight, uh, you're not a woman?"
Patrick says: "No."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well then, you're fired."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uhh, if anybody needs me, I'll be in my office for, I dunno, the next 20 years or so."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, buddy, what do you say we go home and get started on this list?"
Patrick says: "Yaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhoooooooo!"
SpongeBob says: "Yaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhoooooooo!"
