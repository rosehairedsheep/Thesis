Squidward is sleeping until SpongeBob knocks on the door causing him to wake up.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "What do you want, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Time for work, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Another day, another dollar."
Squidward says: "More like another nickel."
Squidward says: "It's not that funny."
SpongeBob says: "It's funny, because it's true!"
Squidward says: "Move over."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Squidward, see you tomorrow."
Customer #1 says: "And always check for spare change."
SpongeBob says: "Another day, another..."
SpongeBob says: "nickel!"
SpongeBob says: "2 Krabby Patties."
Customer #2 says: "Thanks, kid."
SpongeBob says: "Another day, another nickel."
Customer #2 says: "Oh."
Squidward says: "Begone, laughing tormentor!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, you don't look well!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't?"
Squidward says: "No."
Squidward says: "You should sit down."
SpongeBob says: "But..."
Squidward says: "You're burning up, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "I am?"
Squidward says: "Tell me, SpongeBob, have your sides been hurting?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, a little."
Squidward says: "And your temperature is 175 degrees!"
SpongeBob says: "It's that bad?"
Squidward says: "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Squidward says: "Unless you've been doing a lot of laughing."
SpongeBob says: "I have been laughing a lot, lately."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, you've got to be careful!"
Squidward says: "You're going to burn out your laugh box."
SpongeBob says: "My laugh box?"
Squidward says: "Yes, it's the part of your body that enables laughter."
Squidward says: "If you use it too long without giving it a break, it burns out and you can never laugh again."
SpongeBob says: "Is that what happened to you, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Yes."
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "Listen, SpongeBob, this is serious."
Squidward says: "If you burn your laugh box you live your whole life without ever laughing again."
Sandy says: "Hey, Patrick, you want to hear a joke?"
Patrick says: "Sure, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "Sure, I'd love a good laugh."
Sandy says: "What has four wheels and flies?"
Sandy says: "A garbage truck!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't want to burn out my laugh box, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Well, the most important thing is to stop laughing."
Squidward says: "Any laugh at all could be dangerous."
SpongeBob says: "How long do I have to avoid laughing?"
Squidward says: "Gosh, SpongeBob, I'd say at least for the rest of the day."
Squidward says: "But you better go 24 hours just to be safe."
SpongeBob says: "Thank you so much, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know what I'd do without you!"
SpongeBob says: "Nothing funny over here."
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob, how's it going?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, banana peel, don't!"
Patrick says: "What'd you say?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, no."
Patrick says: "Hey, what the..."
SpongeBob says: "Wait a minute, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Please stop!"
Patrick says: "Right foot first..."
SpongeBob says: "Wait, Patrick, I can't laugh."
Patrick says: "You can't?"
Patrick says: "Oh, I know what to do!"
SpongeBob says: "They're everywhere."
SpongeBob says: "Everywhere!"
Delivery Fish says: "Look out for that pie truck!"
SpongeBob says: "I gotta get outta here."
Patrick says: "Hi, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "It's terrible, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I can't laugh anymore!"
Patrick says: "What happened?"
SpongeBob says: "I went a whole day without laughing and now my laugh is gone."
Patrick says: "Let me take a look."
Mr. Krabs says: "Come in."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's wrong, boy?"
SpongeBob says: "I lost my laugh."
Mr. Krabs says: "You've come to the right place, son."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ya know, there's one thing that always makes me laugh."
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't it just tickle you, boy?"
SpongeBob says: "Not really."
Mr. Krabs says: "This calls for drastic measures."
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't usually do this but you seem desperate."
Mr. Krabs says: "touch it."
SpongeBob says: "Nothing."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, this is worse than I thought."
Mr. Krabs says: "After all, money is the ultimate source of joy."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe I should ask Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "She's a scientist."
Sandy says: "Oh, it's easy if you approach it scientifically, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "Now, what is laughter?"
SpongeBob says: "The thing that used to give my life meaning and purpose, but now mocks me with its cruel indifference."
Sandy says: "But scientifically speaking, it's caused by your epiglottis constricting your larynx causing irregular air intake and respiratory upset."
SpongeBob says: "Sounds painful."
Sandy says: "Science makes everything sound painful, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "Now, here's a humor theory textbook, laugh mechanics, and the quantum giggle theory."
SpongeBob says: "Thank you, Sandy."
Squidward says: "Ah, it sure is peaceful around here since SquarePants became a sad sack."
SpongeBob says: "I read all the books and still nothing."
SpongeBob says: "I guess I'll never laugh again."
Squidward says: "I really hate to see the little guy sad but not as much as I hate to see him happy."
Narrator says: "Later that same evening..."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Squidward."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, this infernal crying has to stop."
SpongeBob says: "But Squidward, I..."
SpongeBob says: "I broke my laugh box!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, there's no such thing as a laugh box!"
Squidward says: "I made the whole thing up to get some peace from your insipid laughter!"
SpongeBob says: "You mean..."
SpongeBob says: "my laugh box isn't broken?"
SpongeBob says: "And it was a cruel lie that sent me into spiraling depression?"
Squidward says: "Uhh, well it sounds pretty harsh when you put it that way, but yes."
SpongeBob says: "I could laugh the whole time?"
Squidward says: "Yeah."
Squidward says: "You really fell for it."
SpongeBob says: "I guess I did."
Squidward says: "You even fell for the ol' thermometer in the boiling oil routine."
SpongeBob says: "It's really not that funny, Squidward."
Squidward says: "It's hilarious!"
SpongeBob says: "See ya later, Squidward."
Patrick says: "Look, he's waking up."
Squidward says: "Where am I?"
Sandy says: "You're in the hospital, silly."
Sandy says: "You broke your laugh box."
Mr. Krabs says: "The doctor said it was the most tiny, dried-out, underused laugh box he ever laid eyes on."
Patrick says: "So they cut it out."
Squidward says: "Cut it out?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Patrick says: "Yeah, wanna see it?"
Patrick says: "It's fun to shake it up and watch it bounce around."
Squidward says: "Gimme!"
Squidward says: "Oh."
Squidward says: "I can never laugh again?"
Doctor says: "Nonsense."
Doctor says: "Your laugh should be stronger than ever."
Squidward says: "But, you cut out my laugh box."
Doctor says: "Yes, but uhh, one of your friends generously allowed us to transplant part of theirs to you."
Patrick says: "Nope."
Mr. Krabs says: "They wouldn't pay me."
Sandy says: "You're getting warmer."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, you laugh just like me."
