Narrator says: "Ah, the Krusty Krab."
Narrator says: "Bikini Bottom's premiere daytime eatery."
Narrator says: "Where it will be closing time right about..."
Squidward says: "What?"
Tom says: "Are you open?"
Squidward says: "Read the sign."
Tom says: "I'll have a Krabby Patty Deluxe and a double chili kelp fries."
Squidward says: "No, you won't!"
Squidward says: "I can't hang out here all night!"
Squidward says: "I've got a life."
Tom says: "Well, fine, if you don't want my money!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You mean, if we stayed open later, you'd give us your money?"
Tom says: "Sure!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward,  welcome to the night shift."
Mr. Krabs says: "From now on, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours a day."
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "Now we never have to stop working!"
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "See ya in the morning, boys!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I can't hang out here all night!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I've got a life."
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "Isn't this great, Squidward?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Just you and me together for hours and hours and hours and then the sun'll come up and it'll be tomorrow and we'll still be working!"
SpongeBob says: "Are you ready to rock, Squidward?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Good!"
SpongeBob says: "'Cause we've got customers!"
Squidward says: "Here."
Squidward says: "Please hit me as hard as you can."
SpongeBob says: "Pst, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I'm working in the kitchen  at night!"
Squidward says: "Don't hold back."
SpongeBob says: "Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night!"
SpongeBob says: "Night!"
Squidward says: "Will you please?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "Here,  give me a moment's peace and take out the trash."
SpongeBob says: "All right!"
SpongeBob says: "You mean outside?"
Squidward says: "That's where the dumpster is, yes."
SpongeBob says: "I don't know, Squidward,  it's kinda dark out there."
Squidward says: "But I thought you liked the night shift."
SpongeBob says: "You're right."
SpongeBob says: "Piece of cake."
Squidward says: "So you're not afraid?"
SpongeBob says: "Pfft, nah."
Squidward says: "Well I am."
Squidward says: "Especially after,  well, you know."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "What do I know?"
Squidward says: "You don't remember?"
Squidward says: "It was all over the news."
SpongeBob says: "Tell me, tell me!"
Squidward says: "No, no, no, I probably shouldn't."
Squidward says: "It would ruin the night shift for you."
SpongeBob says: "What happened, what happened, what happened?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Squidward says: "You mean you've never heard the story of the  "Hash-Slinging Slasher?"
SpongeBob says: "The Slash-Bringing Hasher?"
Squidward says: "The Hash-Slinging Slasher."
SpongeBob says: "The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging, The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa."
Squidward says: "Yes."
Squidward says: "The Hash-Slinging Slasher."
Squidward says: "But, most people just call him The Ha--- because that's all they have time to say, before he gets them!"
SpongeBob says: "Tell me the story!"
Squidward says: "Years ago at this very restaurant, the Hash-Slinging Slasher used to be a fry cook, just like you, only clumsier."
Squidward says: "And then, one night, when he was cutting the patties..."
Squidward says: "it happened."
SpongeBob says: "He forgot the secret sauce?"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "He didn't wash his hands?"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Irregular portions?"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "He cut off his own hand by mistake."
SpongeBob says: "You mean like this?"
SpongeBob says: "But what about this?"
Squidward says: "Except he wasn't a sponge!"
SpongeBob says: "So?"
Squidward says: "So it didn't grow back!"
Squidward says: "And he replaced his hand with a rusty spatula."
Squidward says: "And then, he got hit by a bus!"
Squidward says: "And..."
Squidward says: "at his funeral, they fired him!"
Squidward says: "So now, every..."
Squidward says: "what day is it?"
SpongeBob says: "Tuesday."
Squidward says: "Tuesday night, his ghost returns to the Krusty Krab to wreak his horrible vengeance."
SpongeBob says: "But tonight's Tuesday night!"
Squidward says: "Then he'll be coming."
SpongeBob says: "How will we know?"
Squidward says: "There are three signs that signal the approach of the Hash-Slinging Slasher."
Squidward says: "First, the lights will flicker on and off."
Squidward says: "Next..."
Harold says: "Dude, can I have some ketchup?"
Squidward says: "Oh, here you go."
Squidward says: "Then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand..."
SpongeBob says: "No."
Squidward says: "He opens the door..."
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "And you know what he does next?"
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Squidward says: "You really want to know?"
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Squidward says: "Are you sure you want to know?"
SpongeBob says: "What, what, what does he do?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, I was joking!"
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Squidward says: "It's not true."
Squidward says: "None of it's true."
SpongeBob says: "It's not?"
Squidward says: "Of course not."
Squidward says: "Nobody has a spatula for a hand."
Squidward says: "It was all a joke."
SpongeBob says: "Ohhhhh..."
Squidward is shown at the counter reading a book. Squidward hears spooky noises and feels water dripping on him but he doesn't know what it is.
SpongeBob says: "There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day."
Squidward says: "Open 24 hours a day."
Squidward says: "What a stupid idea."
Squidward says: "Who wants a Krabby Patty at three in the morning?"
Squidward says: "Just look at this place."
Squidward says: "It's like a ghost town in here."
Squidward says: "Very funny, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Squidward says: ""And the lights will flicker on and off."
Squidward says: "" Just like the story."
Squidward says: "I get it."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?"
Squidward says: "I'm not doing it."
Squidward says: "It must be the stupid, faulty wiring in here."
Squidward says: "This place isn't built to run 24 hours a day!"
SpongeBob says: "Nice try, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Nice try, what?"
SpongeBob says: ""The phone will ring and there will be no one there."
SpongeBob says: ""  Oh, you crack me up."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, I'm not doing this."
SpongeBob says: "I didn't know the buses ran this late."
Squidward says: "They don't..."
SpongeBob says: "Well, they're dropping someone off."
Squidward says: "The Sash-Ringing, Flash-Singing, the Bash-Pinging..."
SpongeBob says: "The Hash-Slinging Slasher!"
Squidward says: "At last you understand!"
Squidward says: "We're doomed!"
SpongeBob says: "No, that's not it."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, there are two problems with your theory."
Squidward says: "One, I hate you."
Squidward says: "And two, how can that be me when I'm standing right here?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "The Hash-Slinging Slasher!"
Squidward says: "The Hash-Slinging Slasher!"
SpongeBob says: "He's going to flip me!"
SpongeBob says: "Get away!"
SpongeBob says: "Get away!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, no matter what I've said, I've always sort of liked you!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!"
Squidward says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Get away!"
SpongeBob says: "Get away!"
SpongeBob says: "Get out of here!"
SpongeBob says: "You're not welcome here!"
Richard says: "Can I have a job application?"
Richard says: "I brought my own spatula."
Richard says: "I called here earlier, but I hung up 'cause I was nervous."
SpongeBob says: "Do you have references?"
SpongeBob says: "Nosferatu!"
Squidward says: "Nosferatu!"
Richard says: "Nosferatu!"
