Episode starts at Goo Lagoon. SpongeBob is eating ice cream, while Patrick is tanning.
SpongeBob says: "This is how to live, isn't it, my friend?"
Patrick says: "You said it, buddy."
Larry comes in riding a motorcycle. SpongeBob and Patrick scream, and sand gets in their faces. Larry does flips, then rides through a picnic blanket, then pulls one of his brakes causing him to go in circles, getting more sand on SpongeBob and Patrick. He then rides on top of the pile of sand, then through the life guard station causing it to set on fire, and everyone cheers.
