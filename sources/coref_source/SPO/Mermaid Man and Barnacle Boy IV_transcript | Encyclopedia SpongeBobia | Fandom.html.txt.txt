Mermaid Man says: "Through the double doors!"
Mermaid Man says: "Away!"
Narrator says: "And also these guys."
Barnacle Boy says: "I told you I'm not hungry, Mermaid Man!"
Mermaid Man says: "N-nonsense, Barnacle Boy, we've got to keep up our strength for the fight against evil!"

Mermaid Man says: "To the register!"
Mermaid Man says: "Away!"
Squidward says: "Can I help you?"
Mermaid Man says: "A double Krabby Patty and Coral Bits for me, and a silly meal for the lad."
Barnacle Boy says: "It's not for the toy, I just..."
Barnacle Boy says: "I've gotta fit in the tights, y'know?"
Squidward says: "Whatever."
Squidward says: "Five dollars, please."
Mermaid Man says: "You got it, bucky."
Squidward says: "No."
Barnacle Boy says: "that guy has been saving your butt since before you were born."
Barnacle Boy says: "Don't you got a living legend discount or something?"
Squidward says: "This is a restaurant, not a lending library."
Barnacle Boy says: "Well, next time danger threatens, don't expect any help from us."
Squidward says: "I'm shaking."
Squidward says: "Heh."
Squidward says: "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy."
Mermaid Man says: "If you wanna grow up strong like me,..."

SpongeBob says: "You forgot your belt!"
SpongeBob says: "You forgot—"
Squidward says: "Here's your shake, sir."
Squidward says: "Grr."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "What's going on in here?"
Squidward says: "Huh?"
Squidward says: "Why's everything all tiny?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know."
Squidward says: "What do you got there?"
SpongeBob says: "Nothing."
Squidward says: "No, really?"
SpongeBob says: "Nothing."
Squidward says: "You've got something, alright."
Squidward says: "Let's see it."
SpongeBob says: "No, no!"
Squidward says: "Is that Mermaid Man's belt?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes."
Squidward says: "Wow."
Squidward says: "I can't believe he'd lend it to you."
SpongeBob says: "Me, uh..."
SpongeBob says: "either."
Squidward says: "He didn't lend it to you, did he?"
SpongeBob says: "Please don't tell!"
Squidward says: "You stole it!"
SpongeBob says: "Please don't tell!"
Squidward says: "Oh, I'm telling."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure!"
SpongeBob says: "Please don't tell!"
Squidward says: "Uh-oh!"
Squidward says: "There's the phone."
SpongeBob says: "Don't!"
Squidward says: "I'm walking towards the phone!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Squidward says: "I'm getting closer to the phone."
SpongeBob says: "Do-o-o-n't!"
Squidward says: "And now, for the moment we've all been waiting for."
SpongeBob says: "I'm begging you!"
Squidward says: "Hello."
Squidward says: "I'd like to speak to Mer--  Ow!"
Mermaid Man says: "Hello?"
Mermaid Man says: "Hello?"
Squidward says: "What did you do to me?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Squidward, but you made me do it!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, if you don't return me to normal size right now, you are gonna be in really big trouble!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh..."
SpongeBob says: "uh, okay, uh..."
Squidward says: "I said now!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh..."
SpongeBob says: "Uh..."
Squidward says: "Do you hear me?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "Don't you know how to work that thing?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, I can do it!"
Squidward says: "Stop!"
Squidward says: "I've got an idea."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Ehh?"
Patrick says: "Huh?"
Patrick says: "Oh."
Patrick says: "Hi, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I was at work, and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy came, and I got this belt, and look."
Patrick says: "A Squidward action figure!"
Patrick says: "Let me play with him!"
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Fighter pilot!"
Patrick says: "Dive bomb!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
Patrick says: "And then comes a giant fist!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, no!"
SpongeBob says: "That's not an action figure!"
SpongeBob says: "That's the real Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "I shrunk him by accident."
Patrick says: "Oh..."
SpongeBob says: "Wait, you don't understand!"
SpongeBob says: "This is serious!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know how to unshrink him!"
SpongeBob says: "He could be stuck like this for the rest of his life."
Patrick says: "Oh, don't worry about it."
Patrick says: "He'll find love one day."
SpongeBob says: "You think so?"
Patrick says: "Well, sure."
Patrick says: "But it'll be with someone his own size."
Patrick says: "Like this pickle!"
Patrick says: "See?"
Patrick says: "They like each other!"
Squidward says: "N-n-n-n-no."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, if only I knew how to work this thing!"
Patrick says: "Let me take a look at it."
Patrick says: "Hmmm."
Patrick says: "You know what the problem is?"
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Patrick says: "You got it set to  'W' for Wumbo."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I don't think Wumbo is a real word."
Patrick says: "Come on!"
Patrick says: "You know..."
Patrick says: "I wumbo, You wumbo, He, she, me..."
Patrick says: "wumbo!"
Patrick says: "Wumbo, wumboing, we'll have the wumbo, Wumborama..."
Patrick says: "Wumbology, the study of wumbo?"
Patrick says: "It's first grade, SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "I wonder if a fall from this height would be enough to kill me."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you."
Patrick says: "Well, all right, then."
Patrick says: "Let her rip!"
Patrick says: "It worked!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh no!"
Patrick says: "Look, SpongeBob's giant!"
Patrick says: "Can I be giant next?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I'm not giant, you shrunk too!"
Patrick says: "You're kidding!"
Squidward says: "Hey!"
Squidward says: "Now will you take us to Mermaid Man?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Until then, you'll be safe in this jar."
Patrick says: "You know what's funny?"
Patrick says: "My pickle started out in a jar, and now it's in one again!"
Patrick says: "Heh."
Patrick says: "It's like a pun or something."
Patrick says: "Heheh."
SpongeBob says: "It's only two people no big deal, nobody else saw it."
Sandy says: "Howdy, SpongeBob!"

Mrs. SquarePants says: "You need to admit your mistakes."
SpongeBob says: "Mom?"
Mermaid Man says: "Your mother's right, son."
Mermaid Man says: "Mermaid Man will understand."
Barnacle Boy says: "You're Mermaid Man, you old coot!"
Mermaid Man says: "Oh, yeah."
SpongeBob says: "Mermaid Man?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm so sorry, it's just that I'm such a big fan, and your belt, and..."

Barnacle Boy says: "But this is ridiculous!"
Everyone says: "Everything's too big!"
SpongeBob says: "I've got it!"
Squidward says: "I guess this is okay."
Larry says: "Yeah, what's the difference?"
Nancy says: "Good idea, SpongeBob."
Plankton says: "Well, it's great to be back!"
Plankton says: "Huh?"
