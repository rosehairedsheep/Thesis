Patrick says: "I see you got the paper."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hey, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I'd better get going."
Patrick says: "Yep, see you later."
SpongeBob says: "What did you say?"
Patrick says: "What did you say?"
Patrick says: "Well, I didn't say anything."
SpongeBob says: "I didn't say anything, either."
SpongeBob says: "See you later then."
Patrick says: "See you later then."
SpongeBob says: "Alright, quit messing with me!"
SpongeBob says: "I know you said something."
Patrick says: "Ah, but it is you  That's what's messing with us!"
SpongeBob says: "It's a baby scallop."
Patrick says: "I'll take care of this!"
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "It's totally helpless."
SpongeBob says: "It looks like he can't even fly yet."
Patrick says: "What's the matter, is he stupid?"
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick, he's just a baby."
SpongeBob says: "He's all alone with no one to take care of him."
Patrick says: "Well, we can't just leave him out here."
SpongeBob says: "You're right."
SpongeBob says: "Come on, let's take him into the pineapple."
Patrick says: "Let me see!"
Patrick says: "I think somebody's hungry!"
SpongeBob says: "Is it true?"
SpongeBob says: "Are you hungry?"
Junior says: "Cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep!"
SpongeBob says: "I've got just the thing."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob SquarePants, are you crazy?"
Patrick says: "That's not the right food for a little fella like him!"
SpongeBob says: "Of course not."
SpongeBob says: "I don't know what I was thinking."
SpongeBob says: "What he needs is a tiny Krabby Patty."
Junior says: "Blech!"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "No one's ever turned down one of these before."
SpongeBob says: "French fries?"
Junior says: "Unh-unh."
Worm says: "Hello, sea creatures!"
Worm says: "I bring you greetings from Apple World!"
SpongeBob says: "Of course!"
SpongeBob says: "Scallops love worms."
Worm says: "Huh, wait!"
Worm says: "We will bury you!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, you should be good for the rest of the..."
Patrick says: "What now?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know!"
SpongeBob says: "Aww, don't cry."
Patrick says: "Do something, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Uhh..."
SpongeBob says: "uhh..."
SpongeBob says: "uhh..."
SpongeBob says: "Blah-blah-blah!"
SpongeBob says: "Look at the funny face!"
SpongeBob says: "Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo!"
SpongeBob says: "Look at the funny face!"
SpongeBob says: "Look at the funny face!"
Patrick says: "Wait!"
Patrick says: "I think I might know the problem."
SpongeBob says: "How did you know?"
Patrick says: "How do you think?"
Patrick says: "And I've been doing it all by myself for almost a year."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, I'm sure glad you're here."
Patrick says: "I know, good thing there's two of us."
SpongeBob says: "You know, Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves."
Patrick says: "Yeah."
Patrick says: "At least until it's old enough to be on its own."
Patrick says: "Oh, I wanna be the mom!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt."
Patrick says: "You're right."
Patrick says: "If I was a mom..."
Patrick says: "Just call me Daddy!"
Patrick says: "It sure is cute when it's asleep."
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "I never thought being a parent could be this much fun."
SpongeBob says: "Me neither."
Patrick says: "Well, good night, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Good night, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Alright!"
Patrick says: "All this parenting stuff makes me hungry."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Kid's got a stinky."
Patrick says: "Ahh."
Patrick says: "Wish I could, but I gotta get going."
SpongeBob says: "Going?"
SpongeBob says: "Where are you going?"
Patrick says: "I'm goin' to work."
Patrick says: "I'm the dad, remember?"
SpongeBob says: "You mean I have to do all this baby stuff myself?"
Patrick says: "I'll give you a break tonight when I get home."
Patrick says: "Don't you two stop being adorable."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
Patrick says: "Phew!"
Patrick says: "What a day."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, great, you're home."
SpongeBob says: "Now you can help me with the baby."
Patrick says: "Aw, gee, SpongeBob, I'd love to, but I'm totally beat from work."
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
Patrick says: "That guy got hit in the head with a coconut!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what about my break?"
Patrick says: "Oh yeah, your break."
Patrick says: "Uh, tomorrow, I promise."
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, okay, tomorrow."
Narrator says: "Tomorrow..."
Patrick says: "Phew!"
Patrick says: "Another tough day."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Patrick, I'm so glad you're home after working all day."
SpongeBob says: "I can't wait for my break."
Patrick says: "Work was a killer."
Patrick says: "I need my chair."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I really need my..."
Patrick says: "Tomorrow for sure."
Narrator says: "Tomorrow for sure..."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Patrick says: "I'll get to it eventually..."
Narrator says: "Eventually..."
SpongeBob says: "Uhhh?"
Patrick says: "Uhhh."
Narrator says: "Uhhh..."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick Star, we need to talk."
Patrick says: "Just one more minute, I gotta..."
SpongeBob says: "Don't "one more minute" me, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Man!"
Patrick says: "Hey, I'm missin' the coconut!"
SpongeBob says: "You haven't been helping at all with Junior!"
SpongeBob says: "We made a commitment and you're not doing your share!"
SpongeBob says: "You never do anything."
Patrick says: "I changed his diaper!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, once."
Patrick says: "He's only this big."
Patrick says: "How many diapers could he possibly use?"
SpongeBob says: "Hmmm?"
Patrick says: "Oh, that's not so much."
SpongeBob says: "Hmmm?"
Patrick says: "So?"
SpongeBob says: "So, what's the plan for the day?"
Patrick says: "No more foolin' around."
Patrick says: "From now on, I'm Super-Dad!"
Patrick says: "I'll work straight through lunch so I can get home on time."
Patrick says: "So make sure you save a big ol' stinky diaper for me to change, and you can take the night off, pal."
SpongeBob says: "Great, so I'll see you at six o'clock."
Patrick says: "Six o'clock."
SpongeBob says: "Six o'clock."
Patrick says: "Six o'clock."
SpongeBob says: "Six o'clock."
Patrick says: "Six o'clock."
SpongeBob says: "Six o'clock."
Patrick says: "Six o'clock."
Narrator says: "12:00 midnight."
Patrick walks in with a lampshade over his head, giggling and turns on the light.
Patrick says: "Oh boy, that was some party!"
Patrick says: "What?"
Patrick says: "What?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, nothing."
Patrick says: "Oh, what a relief."
Patrick says: "For a second there, I thought you were mad at me."
SpongeBob says: "Do you remember what you said to me this morning?"
Patrick says: "Somethin' about root beer, right?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
Patrick says: "Oh, wait, wait, let me guess."
Patrick says: "I give up."
SpongeBob says: "Does..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "ring a bell?"
SpongeBob says: "What?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Where do you think you're going?"
SpongeBob says: "Work?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Cut to SpongeBob, not wearing his mother-like clothing anymore, walking outside to Patrick's rock. He opens it up, and finds Patrick in his easy chair, watching TV.
Patrick says: "He got hit in the head with two coconuts!"
SpongeBob says: "So, this is work?"
Patrick says: "You know, it's not as easy as it looks."
Patrick says: "Sometimes, I gotta move the antenna, sometimes, I lose the remote,  and sometimes, my butt itches real bad!"
Patrick says: "Oh, so this is the thanks I get for working overtime?"
SpongeBob is enraged. He balls his fists, turns red in anger and fumes so hard, his entire body shakes. Then he loses his temper and goes ballistic on Patrick, and his face morphs into a stereotypical Asian face with lots of teeth.
SpongeBob says: "Overtime?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob jumps into Patrick's rock, and they both begin to argue intensely.
Patrick says: "Yeah, overtime, pal!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, boy, yeah, you're working!"
Patrick says: "You know what that means?"
SpongeBob says: "And that's the kind of work you're doing?"
Patrick says: "​It means working when you're just too tired to work!"
SpongeBob says: "Show me where I can sign up for this, because I've been working my fingers to the bone!"
Junior is heard beginning to chirp.
Patrick says: "You just keep going on working and working!"
SpongeBob says: "​You never help!"
SpongeBob says: "Never!"
Junior's chirping intensifies, which makes the two finally stop arguing and listen to it.
Patrick says: "There's that stupid noise again!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, that's not a stupid noise."
SpongeBob says: "That's just Junior about to jump out of that two-story window."
Patrick and SpongeBob see Junior teetering on the edge of the window of SpongeBob's house, ready to fly.
Patrick says: "Oh."
All at once, Patrick and SpongeBob are struck with shock by what's really happening.
Both says: "Junior!"
Junior jumps down the window. SpongeBob and Patrick quickly run to catch Junior.
Patrick says: "Here we come, buddy!"
Patrick says: "I'm gonna getcha!"
Patrick says: "I'm gonna getcha!"
They slam on SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob then bounces out of Patrick's stomach.
SpongeBob says: "Did you catch him?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "No."
Both says: "We're bad parents!"
SpongeBob says: "Junior?"
SpongeBob says: "He's flying!"
Patrick says: "I guess he's all grown up."
Patrick says: "That's my boy."
SpongeBob says: "Goodbye!"
Patrick says: "Goodbye, Junior!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, Patrick, he doesn't need us anymore."
Patrick says: "This is the hardest part of every parent's life, I assume."
SpongeBob says: "Despite all we've been through, it was worth it."
Patrick says: "Yeah..."
Patrick says: "Let's have another."
SpongeBob looks shocked.
