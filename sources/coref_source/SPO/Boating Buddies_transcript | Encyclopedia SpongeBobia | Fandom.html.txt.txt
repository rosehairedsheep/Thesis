Episode starts at SpongeBob's house, and SpongeBob is brushing Gary's shell.
SpongeBob says: "97, 98, 99, 100."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Gary, let's do the other side now."
SpongeBob says: "Gary, can you hear that?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh Squidward, it's you."
SpongeBob says: "I thought I heard something."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, I've been sitting here motionless for 45 minutes."
Squidward says: "What could you possibly have heard me doing?"
SpongeBob says: "Breathing."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, I will give you $5 if you let me enjoy the rest of my morning, in peace."
Squidward says: "Hey, I could have sworn I had $5 in here."
SpongeBob says: "I have it, Squidward, you gave it to me to leave you alone yesterday."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, you can have the $5 back."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "I don't care what Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs says!"
SpongeBob says: "Coffee rain!"
Squidward says: "It's hot chocolate."
SpongeBob says: "Chocolate rain!"
Squidward says: "It's locked!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Huh?"
Squidward says: "The key!"
Squidward says: "Oh, where did I put that stupid..."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Oh, why can't I just find?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
Squidward says: "What?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "You left your keys on the table back there."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Yes?"
SpongeBob says: "Didn't you used to have one of those cucumber bicycles?"
Squidward says: "Oh,  that was a recumbent bicycle, and I sold it."
SpongeBob says: "Why?"
Squidward says: "So I could get further away from you!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, I'll see you later then, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Bon voyage, nincompoop!"
Squidward says: "Can I help you, officer?"
Policeman says: "No, but you can help yourself to this ticket."
Squidward says: "Ticket?"
Squidward says: "Officer, please!"
Squidward says: "I have impeccable boat smarts!"
Squidward says: "I pried myself in obtaining an un-soiled driving record!"
Squidward says: "It's all that I have!"
Policeman says: "Well, you can have it again, right after you complete boating school."
Squidward says: "Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Squidward!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Good morning, class."
Mrs. Puff says: "Would everyone please take a seat?"
SpongeBob says: "Psst, Squidward, sit here."
SpongeBob says: "Here."
Squidward says: "Um, excuse me, there doesn't seem to be any empty seats left."
Mrs. Puff says: "But there's one right next to SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Do you mind?"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "We're boating buddies now!"
SpongeBob says: "I'll teach you everything I know, and then we can."
Squidward says: "We won't be doing anything, because there is no we!"
Squidward says: "Understand?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Quiet in the front please."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I understand."
SpongeBob says: "I understand perfectly, boating buddy."
Mrs. Puff says: "Okay class, how about we get to know our new students, by telling each other why we were sentenced to I mean why we are enrolled in boating school."
Student says: "Um, I got caught speeding."
Mrs. Puff says: "Very good."
Mrs. Puff says: "Next."
Student says: "I don't see what's so very good about it."
Mrs. Puff says: "No, I didn't mean very."
Student says: "I know exactly what you meant."
Mrs. Puff says: "Next."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I am here because I..."
Mrs. Puff says: "We all know why you're here, SpongeBob."
Mrs. Puff says: "What about you, sir?"
Squidward says: "Me?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Yes."
Mrs. Puff says: "Would you like to tell the rest of the class, why you're with us today?"
Squidward says: "Why I'm."
Squidward says: "All right, I'll tell you."
Squidward says: "I was trying to get away, from him!"
Squidward says: "He is the bane, of my existence!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Yours too?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Uhh."
Mrs. Puff says: "What I meant to say was, please come up to the chalkboard, and draw a diagram of the incident."
Squidward says: "Gladly."
Squidward says: "evasive action."
Squidward says: "And by increasing speed slightly, I created a safety cushion, while in-invertenttly attracting the attention, of said law enforcement official."
Squidward says: "May I sit down now, sweet cheeks?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Why, certainly."
Mrs. Puff says: "And perhaps now, SpongeBob would like to come up, and illustrate his side of the story."
Squidward says: "His side?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, first, I started over here."
SpongeBob says: "And then I went way over here."
SpongeBob says: "Do-do-do-do, like that."
Everyone says: "SpongeBob and Squidward, best boating buddies, forever."
SpongeBob says: "Do you like it Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Shut it."
SpongeBob says: "Ah, lunch time, eh, boating buddy?"
Squidward says: "I'll have to eat over here, like in grade school."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, do you have any mustard in there?"
Squidward says: "Mmm, Bon app√©tit, Squiddy."
Mrs. Puff says: "Okay, class, it's time for our behind the wheel lesson."
Mrs. Puff says: "Squidward, you'll be riding with SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Eh, didn't see that coming."
Mrs. Puff says: "Now, we're going to take this nice and slow."
Mrs. Puff says: "SpongeBob, what do we do when pulling away from the curb?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, step on the gas?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Good."
Mrs. Puff says: "Nice and easy."
Mrs. Puff says: "Now let's slowly..."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, look out!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, give me that wheel!"
SpongeBob says: "I got it, I got it."
Squidward says: "Just let go of it!"
Grandma says: "Hooligans!"
Scientist 1 says: "Johnson, I finally figured out a way to shrink an ordinary mail man, down to the size of a grain of sand."
Scientist 2 says: "How?"
Scientist 1 says: "By using this shrink ray."
Scientist 2 says: "Mother of mercy!"
Scientist 2 says: "Where'd they go?"
Scientist 1 says: "There!"
Scientist 1 says: "They're heading right for that discarded potato chip."
Scientist 2 says: "What's the matter?"
Scientist 1 says: "Potato chips are his favorite snack."
Scientist 2 says: "No, no, no."

SpongeBob says: "Hey, where'd Squidward go?"
Squidward says: "I was just leaving."
Mrs. Puff says: "Okay class, it's time to take our final exam."
Mrs. Puff says: "Please have your pencils ready."
Squidward says: "How many times do I have to tell you?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "I am not your buddy!"
Squidward says: "I don't need your help, and I don't need you, ever!"
Squidward says: "Now just kindly let me take this stupid test, so I can get out of here, and never have to see you again, for the rest of my life!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay Squidward, if that's the way you want it."
Squidward says: "Thank you."
Mrs. Puff says: "3 more minutes, class."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob?"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, I need your help."
Mrs. Puff says: "2 more minutes."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, please?"
Squidward says: "This is important."
SpongeBob says: "You said you didn't need my help, Squidward, and that you didn't need me."
Squidward says: "No no, I didn't."
Squidward says: "I never said that."
Squidward says: "All right, I said it."
Squidward says: "But that was before."
SpongeBob says: "Before what?"
Mrs. Puff says: "1 more minute, class."
Squidward says: "Before we were,  boating buddies."
SpongeBob says: "Yay!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Okay class, time's up."
Squidward says: "Time can't be up."
Squidward says: "I didn't even get a chance to fill in a single answer."
Squidward says: "What am I supposed to do?"
Mrs. Puff says: "You do the same thing that everybody else does who failed the test, you take it again next week."
Squidward says: "Next week?"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry Squidward, I've never gotten one answer right on this test."
