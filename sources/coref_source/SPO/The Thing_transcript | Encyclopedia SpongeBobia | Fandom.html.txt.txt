Squidward peeks out his door to make sure SpongeBob is not around.
Squidward says: "It's too quiet."
Squidward says: "Something isn't right around here."
Patrick says: "Do it again."
Patrick says: "Do it again."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
Squidward says: "Will you two be quiet?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "I'm trying to watch public television."
Patrick says: "Do it again, do it again."
Squidward says: "If those two want to ruin my quiet evening at home, they're going to have to do better than that."
Squidward says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Squidward says: "You're still there, aren't you?"
SpongeBob says: "Good evening, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Not so fast."
Squidward says: "You two little monsters aren't about to ruin my evening."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, we're not here to ruin it."
SpongeBob says: "We're here to enhance it."
SpongeBob says: "Isn't that right, Pat?"
Patrick says: "Yeah."
Patrick says: "We're here..."
Squidward says: "Can't a hard working Squid get a little TV time alone?"
Patrick says: "Could you turn it up?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, Squidward, could you turn it down a little?"
Patrick says: "Squidward, what's this about?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, how come he's so emotional?"
Patrick says: "Is he the bad guy?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
Patrick says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
Patrick says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
Patrick says: "Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Enjoy my TV!"
Squidward says: "PFAH!"
Patrick says: "Oh wait, I think I've seen this before."
Patrick says: "This part's funny."
Squidward says: "I'm going to go somewhere far away."
Squidward says: "Somewhere far away from those two watching public television on my TV."
Squidward says: "PFAH!"
Squidward says: "They wouldn't know real culture even if it hit them like a truck full of cement."
SpongeBob says: "What is that thing, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "I dunno."
Patrick says: "Let's get a closer look."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, stranger."
SpongeBob says: "I am SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Wait a minute."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe he's not a monster."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe he's an endangered species."
SpongeBob says: "We should help him."
Patrick says: "Yeah, help him."
Patrick says: "Go away!"
Patrick says: "Can't you tell nobody wants you?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "You're endangered!"
SpongeBob says: "Not like that."
SpongeBob says: "With lots of love and affection."
SpongeBob says: "We can take care of him."
SpongeBob says: "Here's your food bowl."
Patrick says: "And some kibble."
SpongeBob says: "You can live here forever and ever."
Patrick says: "I don't think Gary likes Smelly."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, Gary's never attacked anyone like that except Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I guess Smelly can't live here."
Patrick says: "Ah!"
Patrick says: "He can come live with me."
SpongeBob says: "That's a great idea, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Youâ€™ve always wanted a pet."
SpongeBob says: "Bye, Smelly."
SpongeBob says: "Have fun at Patrick's."
Patrick is dragging Smelly to his house while Smelly tries to get into Squidward's house, but Patrick pulls him away.
Patrick says: "No, no, Smelly."
Patrick says: "Squidward doesn't like pets."
Patrick says: "Smelly!"
Patrick says: "Come back!"
Patrick says: "Smelly!"
Police says: "Freeze!"
Police says: "You're surrounded."
Police says: "There is no way out."
SpongeBob says: "Smelly."
SpongeBob says: "Excuse me."
SpongeBob says: "Pardon me."
SpongeBob says: "If I can just scootch through there."
SpongeBob says: "Excuse me."
SpongeBob says: "Pardon me."
SpongeBob says: "Excuse me."
SpongeBob says: "You leave Smelly alone."
SpongeBob says: "He's just a poor, dumb wild animal."
Police says: "Wild animals don't belong here, son."
Police says: "They belong in the zoo."
Police says: "Get 'em, boys."
SpongeBob says: "Smelly."
Isabelle says: "Mommy, what is that thing?"
Sadie says: "I don't know but it's hideous, isn't it?"
SpongeBob says: "This isn't good."
Patrick says: "You're absolutely right."
Patrick says: "It needs mustard."
SpongeBob says: "No one should be treated like that."
SpongeBob says: "Not even someone as ugly as Smelly."
SpongeBob says: "Something needs to be done about this."
SpongeBob says: "And I know exactly what that thing is."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Patrick, remember the plan?"
Patrick says: "Oh, yeah."
Patrick says: "This one, right?"
SpongeBob says: "No, not that."
SpongeBob says: "I'm talking about the plan to break Smelly out of this animal prison."
Patrick says: "Mmm, good plan."
Patrick says: "You're my hero."
SpongeBob says: "Shh, we'll get caught."
Patrick says: "What?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "I can't hear you!"
Patrick says: "I'm screaming too loud!"
Police says: "You're surrounded."
Police says: "There's no use trying to run."
SpongeBob says: "Run, Patrick, run!"
Patrick says: "I'll let Smelly go first."
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Smelly, you're safe with us."
Patrick says: "I think we lost them."
SpongeBob says: "Well, we're all one big happy family again."
SpongeBob says: "Let's see where this dark sewer tunnel leads."
SpongeBob says: "La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la."
Patrick says: "La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, it's all right, Smelly."
SpongeBob says: "Soon, we'll be home and you can sleep in that cozy little pet carrier you love so much."
Patrick says: "Hey, I see light."
SpongeBob says: "You're right, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "That must be the way out."
SpongeBob says: "Whoa..."
SpongeBob says: "where are we?"
Patrick says: "I'm going to miss him, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Me too, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "Me too, but he's with his kind now, where he belongs, and on that note, let us go back to where we belong."
Kelpy G says: "Ah..."
Kelpy G says: "salutations, my children."
Kelpy G says: "Are you ready for your daily dose of smooth jazz?"
Squidward says: "Um..."
Squidward says: "hi."
