Squidward is dressed in island clothes and playing the piano on an island. He hits one of the notes, but it makes a bell sound so he keeps hitting it to double-check. The sound is coming from SpongeBob hitting a bell.
Dream SpongeBob says: "Order up, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, hey Squidward, did you see me?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, see you later, Squidinator."
Mr. Krabs says: "Good morning, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "So, are you ready?"
Squidward says: "To go home?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No, to exchange gifts for Employee Brotherhood Day."
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, you pay me to stand behind this register and take orders and give change."
Squidward says: "But you could never pay me enough to act brotherly towards..."
Mr. Krabs says: "That attitude of yours is precisely why we're having this little shenanigan."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now pay attention, the lad's got a surprise for ye."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, in honor of employee brotherhood, I present to you a gift."
Squidward says: ""I Heart you..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Try it on, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's got you written all over it."
SpongeBob says: "I wasn't sure how big to make the hole for the head, so I used a watermelon for size."
SpongeBob says: "Do you love it?"
SpongeBob says: "Eyelashes!"
Squidward says: "Now may I resume to my minimum-wage duties?"
Mr. Krabs says: "After you present your brotherhood gift."
Squidward says: "I'll buy the little twerp a gumball."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, no, no, no, no, lad."
Mr. Krabs says: "You know the rules; you have to make the gift."
SpongeBob says: "Is this any better, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "I made this one with my tears."
Mr. Krabs says: "I knew you'd come around, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Make something nice."
Squidward says: "Why can't I just buy something for the little weirdo?"
Captain says: "Heave-ho!"
Captain says: "If you drop one single slice of me booty, I'll have..."
Captain says: "your booty!"
Squidward says: "Uhh.."
Squidward says: "hi, there."
Squidward says: "Those homemade pies sure look good."
Pirate says: "Oh, these aren't homemade."
Pirate says: "They were made in a factory..."
Pirate says: "a bomb factory."
Pirate says: "They're bombs."
Squidward says: "Oh, well, that's too bad."
Squidward says: "I thought they were pies and I wanted to buy one."
Captain says: "Wait!"
Captain says: "We were just kidding about all that bomb stuff."
Captain says: "That'll be 25 bucks, please."
Squidward says: "So, what flavor is it?"
Pirates says: "Cherry."
Pirates says: "Apple."
Pirates says: "Raspberry."
Squidward says: "Well, if it'll get old man Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs off my back."
Squidward says: "Okay, here it is, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, fresh from the oven."
Squidward says: "I'll be returning to my life now."
Mr. Krabs says: "Not yet."
Mr. Krabs says: "I got to make sure you did it right."
Mr. Krabs says: "So, you tried to kill me over a little new age management, eh?"
Squidward says: "But, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, I had no idea."
Squidward says: "I can explain!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, are you okay?"
SpongeBob says: "I heard a..."
SpongeBob says: "wow!"

Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "A bomb?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's where you left it."

SpongeBob says: "Hey guys."
Mr. Krabs says: "You had to kill him."
Mr. Krabs says: "The boy cries you a sweater of tears..."
Mr. Krabs says: "and you kill him."
Mr. Krabs says: "How are you gonna live with yourself?"
Squidward says: "Kill him?"
SpongeBob says: "Here's your order, sir."
Customer says: "Thanks."
Squidward says: "No, no!"
Squidward says: "What we got..."
Squidward says: "we got to call the hospital!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Won't do any good."
Mr. Krabs says: "I've seen this before."
Mr. Krabs says: "When that pie goes up to bat, I mean, hits his lower intestine..."
Mr. Krabs says: "boom!"
Squidward says: "You've seen this before?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Eleven times as a matter of fact."
Squidward says: "Yes, hello, doctor?"
Squidward says: "Hospital?"
Squidward says: "It won't do any good?"
Squidward says: "Eleven times?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't tell him."
Mr. Krabs says: "That'll only make him feel worse."
Mr. Krabs says: "The way I see it, he's only got till sunset."
Mr. Krabs says: "Why ruin his last day on earth?"
Mr. Krabs says: "The lad deserves to enjoy his final hours."
Squidward says: "Uh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes?"
Squidward says: "I forgot to tell you, there's a part two to your gift."
SpongeBob says: "Part two?"
Squidward says: "Please, don't do that."
SpongeBob says: "What's the part two?"
Squidward says: "Well, what's the most fun thing you can think of?"
SpongeBob says: "Actually, I keep a list of the fun things I like to do."
SpongeBob says: "I call it my friendship list."
Squidward says: "Great."
Squidward says: "Uh, let me see it."
SpongeBob says: "The things that are extra fun, I've written in red."
Squidward says: "Everything's in red."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, I know."
Squidward says: "We'd better start now if we want to get through this list before you die..."
Squidward says: "of anticipation."
SpongeBob says: "Then let's roll!"
SpongeBob says: "Heads up, Squidwardâ€”"
SpongeBob says: "looks like they're gonna replace you."
Squidward says: "Uh, yeah."
Squidward says: "Let's take a look at that list."
SpongeBob says: "Well, the first thing I want to do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, I want to show you my best friend, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Hey, Frank."
Squidward says: "Glad that's over."

SpongeBob says: "Knock-knock jokes!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey Squid, knock-knock."
Squidward says: "Who's there?"
SpongeBob says: "I am!"
SpongeBob says: "Turn left, and..."
SpongeBob says: "stop."
SpongeBob says: "See, that's what it would be like if you had me for a face."
Squidward says: "Are you sure you should be poking it like that?"
SpongeBob says: "Who's the doctor here?"
SpongeBob says: "The last thing on the list is..."
Squidward says: "Does it involve more dismemberment?"
SpongeBob says: "Watch the sunset with Squidward."
Squidward says: "Sunset?"
Mr. Krabs says: "The way I see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, it's Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, see you later."
Squidward says: "C'mon buddy, you want a sunset, you'll get a sunset."
SpongeBob says: "Ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful."
SpongeBob says: "Eh, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Yeah."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, this is great, just the three of us."
SpongeBob says: "You, me,..."
SpongeBob says: "and this brick wall that you built between us."
Squidward says: "Yeah."
SpongeBob says: "Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit."
SpongeBob says: "What do they make you think of, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Explosions..."
Squidward says: "I mean, erosion."
SpongeBob says: "You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay."
SpongeBob says: "Here it is, the sunset!"

SpongeBob says: "Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot."
Squidward says: "Why are you still here?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one."
SpongeBob says: "I already filled up this book of ideas."
SpongeBob says: "We should be able to finish by January."
Squidward says: "Forget the book!"
Squidward says: "I spent the whole day with you, doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to explode!"
SpongeBob says: "You want me to explode?"
Squidward says: "Yes!"
Squidward says: "That's what I've been waiting for!"
SpongeBob says: "Um, okay, I'll try."
SpongeBob says: "Now it's your turn!"
Squidward says: "That's not what I meant, you barnacle head!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, good one."
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "You were supposed to explode into a million pieces!"
SpongeBob says: "Why would I do that?"
Squidward says: "Because the pie you ate was a bomb!"
SpongeBob says: "What pie?"
Squidward says: "The one that I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it..."
Squidward says: "th..."
Squidward says: "that pie!"
SpongeBob says: "Pie..."
SpongeBob says: "pie..."
