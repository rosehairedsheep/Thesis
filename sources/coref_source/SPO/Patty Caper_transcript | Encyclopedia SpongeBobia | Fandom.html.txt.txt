Episode starts at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is in Mr. Krabs' office, and all the lights are off.
SpongeBob says: "You wanted to see me, sir?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Pull up a seat, boy."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, there aren't any chairs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Sit down!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now you've worked here for quite some time, boy."
SpongeBob says: "Ooh, yes, sir."
SpongeBob says: "And they've been the best years of my life, sir."
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Listen up, boy, any minute now, a truck driver is going to arrive, and I'm entrusting you to retrieve the secret ingredient!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And I need you to do this without any foul-ups!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Understand?"
SpongeBob says: "Could you repeat that?"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's time!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now go!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And make sure to guard it with your life!"
SpongeBob says: "I won't let you down."
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Yes?"
Mr. Krabs says: "If something happens to that secret ingredient..."
Mr. Krabs says: "don't bother coming back to work!"
S.W.A.T. Team Member 1 says: "You BobPants?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, SpongeBob."
S.W.A.T. Team Member 1 says: "Close enough."
S.W.A.T. Team Member 1 says: "Now get out of here, kid!"
S.W.A.T. Team Member 1 says: "Plenty of folks would love to get a hold of that ingredient."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, sir!"
SpongeBob says: "What's this?"
SpongeBob says: "A hole?"
SpongeBob says: "How did that happen?"
SpongeBob says: "An incision."
SpongeBob says: "Almost as if someone, or something did this on purpose."
SpongeBob says: "That's it!"
SpongeBob says: "A thief must have cut a hole, and swiped the secret ingredient!"
SpongeBob says: "But who?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you doing lollygagging about?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get back to work!"
SpongeBob says: "Right away, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hop to it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "There's lots of hungry customers out there!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs trusted me, and I let him down!"
Patrick says: "Hi, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe you can help me."
Patrick says: "With what?"
SpongeBob says: "With this."
Patrick says: "Here you go, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "Not that kind of help!"
SpongeBob says: "This used to have the Krabby Patty secret ingredient inside."
SpongeBob says: "But now, it's missing!"
Patrick says: "What?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Someone stole it, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "And we need to find out who!"
Patrick says: "Find out!"
SpongeBob says: "You and I are gonna have to do a little detective work!"
Plankton says: "What are we eating this time, Karen?"
Karen says: "Something new."
Plankton says: "Oh, you mean the "secret recipe" I came up with?"
SpongeBob says: "Aha!"
SpongeBob says: "I knew it was you!"
Plankton says: "What was me?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, come on, Plankton, don't play dumb."
SpongeBob says: "You know you stole the secret Krabby Patty ingredient!"
Plankton says: "Is this a joke?"
SpongeBob says: "Why don't you tell me."
SpongeBob says: "Is it?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Plankton says: "Uh, no."
Patrick says: "Good one!"
SpongeBob says: "All right, no more jokes!"
SpongeBob says: "Either you tell me where the secret ingredient is, or we'll be forced to use other means of making you talk!"
Plankton says: "Sorry, I really have nothing for you."
SpongeBob says: "Then how do you explain this?"
Plankton says: "Okay, you caught me."
SpongeBob says: "And so the truth floweth forth."
Plankton says: "Yes, it is a Krabby Patty."
SpongeBob says: "Mm-hmm."
Plankton says: "But, it's my version of a Krabby Patty."
Plankton says: "After thousands of failed attempts to steal the recipe, I learned all but one ingredient needed to make Krabby Patties."
Plankton says: "The most important ingredient, the secret ingredient."
Plankton says: "Over the years, I've methodically gone through almost every letter in the alphabet."
Plankton says: "Right now I'm on the R's."
Plankton says: "And I've gotten up to raw sewage."
SpongeBob says: "Yuck!"
Plankton says: "Try it, tell me what you think."
SpongeBob says: "Well, he's clean."
SpongeBob says: "But if Plankton didn't steal the ingredient, who did?"
Patrick says: "Good question."
SpongeBob says: "Only someone who specializes in science, could reverse engineer the recipe, based on the secret ingredient."
SpongeBob says: "Hmm, a scientist."
SpongeBob says: "Enjoying them Krabby Patties lady?"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "How long have you been standing there, buddy?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, long enough, "buddy."
Sandy says: "I was just storing food for the impending winter."
Sandy says: "Want one?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm onto you, squirrel."
SpongeBob says: "You thought no one could figure it out, but I pieced it together."
SpongeBob says: "I know exactly how you got all those patties."
Sandy says: "What exactly are you getting at, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "What I am getting at, is that you..."
S.W.A.T. Team Member 2 says: "What was that?"
S.W.A.T. Team Member 1 says: "Here's the secret Krabby Patty ingredient."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "then used a time-freezing device to freeze time, used a laser beam to cut open the case, stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient,  reverse engineered it, and made your own patties, so you wouldn't have to pay."
Sandy says: "Or, perhaps I walked into the Krusty Krab, purchased them,  and received a receipt for these legally obtained patties!"
SpongeBob says: "That's right, I cooked this order."
SpongeBob says: "I guess this means you didn't use a laser beam, or invisibility."
Sandy says: "SpongeBob, next time before you run around accusing people of things, make sure your own house is in order first!"
SpongeBob says: "My own house, huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Why'd you do it, Gary?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "You've told us that story 100 times now, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "Unfortunately, my partner and I don't want to hear stories, we want to hear the truth!"
SpongeBob says: "Look, we know you stole the secret ingredient and it's obvious how you did it!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, you're right, Gary, that is impossible."
SpongeBob says: "I never would have stopped to pull up my sock during a pickup."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "What's that, Gary?"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "You did see someone leaving the Krusty Krab with a mysterious black case that night?"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Snail, could you please describe this..."
SpongeBob says: "this marauder to the sketch artist?"
Gary says: "Meow."
Gary says: "Meow."
Gary says: "Meow."
Gary says: "Meow."
Patrick says: "I can't believe it!"
Patrick says: "It was Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Open up in there, Tentacles!"
SpongeBob says: "We know you're in there!"
SpongeBob says: "We just want to ask you a few..."
SpongeBob says: "He's not cooperating."
Patrick says: "You know what to do."
Squidward says: "And one, and..."
SpongeBob says: "Gotcha!"
SpongeBob says: "You thought you could hide your crimes."
Patrick says: "But we hear-ed what you've done."
Squidward says: "If I cared, I'd ask what this is about."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I'm glad you asked, because this is about you stealing the Krabby Patty secret ingredient!"
SpongeBob says: "And we have an eyewitness who saw you leaving the scene of the crime, with a mysterious black case."
Squidward says: "A case like this?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes!"
SpongeBob says: "Because you can't make Krabby Patties without..."
SpongeBob says: "tap dancing shoes?"
Squidward says: "That's right!"
Squidward says: "I was in a tap contest on the night in question."
Squidward says: "As you can see from my third place medallion."
Squidward says: "Get out of my house!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know how, sir, but somebody stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, you were in charge of guarding that secret ingredient with your life!"
SpongeBob says: "I know, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "It just slipped away from me somehow."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, do you have any leads, or clues?"
SpongeBob says: "All I know is that it had to be someone who knew about the delivery, and was at the Krusty Krab during the delivery, and this person would have to know what to do with the secret ingredient when he got it."
Mr. Krabs says: "That would be..."
Mr. Krabs says: "you, SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You stole me secret ingredient!"
SpongeBob says: "Me?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's right."
Mr. Krabs says: "And I know exactly how you carried out this little caper."
Policeman says: "No need."
Policeman says: "We heard it all from this barrel."
Mr. Krabs says: "Then arrest this thief, Officer!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, isn't that the stolen secret ingredient?"
Policeman says: "Am I to understand that you stole the item in question?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, I wouldn't call it stealing..."
Policeman says: "And you were going to let someone else take the fall for this little caper?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I can explain!"
Policeman says: "Please do."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's simple, $1."
Mr. Krabs says: "99 is a lot to pay for the secret ingredient every time I get a delivery, so I s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s..."
Mr. Krabs says: "took it to avoid paying, you know."
Policeman says: "I think Judge Trout will be very interested to hear this little story."
Judge says: "All rise."
Judge says: "Eugene Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Your Honor?"
Judge says: "As punishment for committing the crime of grand theft, I sentence you to give away Krabby Patties for free, all day tomorrow."
Mr. Krabs says: "Give away me patties for free?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Step right up, and get your free Krabby Patties!"
