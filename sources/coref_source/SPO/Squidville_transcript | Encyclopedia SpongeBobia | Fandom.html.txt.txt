SpongeBob walks up to Patrick with a package in his hand.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, look."
SpongeBob says: "I got my..."
Patrick says: "Hey, you got the same reef blower as me!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you made my house sparkling clean."
Patrick says: "Sure did."
SpongeBob says: "We haven't improved Squidward's day yet."
SpongeBob says: "Let's do his house!"
Squidward says: "What's going on out here?"
SpongeBob says: "We're playing with our new reef blowers!"
Squidward says: "Playing with a reef blower?"
Squidward says: "That is the most childish thing I have ever heard of."
SpongeBob says: "But it's fun!"
Squidward says: "Fun?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "How could playing with one of those over-sized hair dryers possibly be fun?"
Patrick says: "Like this..."
SpongeBob says: "Let's do your house, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, you're steaming!"
SpongeBob says: "You're like a steamed vegetable, only smarter."
Squidward says: "Put my windows back!"
SpongeBob says: "No problem, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "We're on your side!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, this is the final straw."
Squidward says: "I am going to move so far away, that I will be able to brag about it."
Tentacle Acres Spokesoctopus says: "Hi there!"
Tentacle Acres Spokesoctopus says: "Is this the final straw?"
Tentacle Acres Spokesoctopus says: "Do you want to move so far away, that you can brag about it?"
Squidward says: "Four-way!"
Tentacle Acres Spokesoctopus says: "Four-way intersection, and skip rope with it, than continue living where you do now?"
Patrick says: "I hate this channel."
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "No!"
Tentacle Acres Spokesoctopus says: "-Tentacle Acres!"
Tentacle Acres Spokesoctopus says: "Where happiness is just a suction cup away!"
Squidward says: "Hello?"
Guard says: "Yes, can I help you?"
Squidward says: "I'm here about the happiness."
Squidward says: "I'll be moving in now."
Guard says: "Are you alone?"
Squidward says: "No."
Squidward says: "I mean, yes."
Squidward says: "There's nobody with me."
Squidward says: "Yes, peace and quiet."
Guard says: "Are you now, or have you ever been, a sponge?"
Squidward says: "No."
Other Octopus says: "I've seen more alert people in a retirement home!"
Squidward says: "Oh, which way to the Living-without-a-brain seminar?"
Squidward says: "Don't be late!"
Other Octopus says: "I've heard better comebacks from a turkey sandwich!"
Other Octopus says: "Get a life!"
Squidward says: "This place is even better than I expected!"
Cut to night, where Squidward is in cap, nightshirt, and slipper, going to bed. His clarinet, as always, is next to him.
Squidward says: "Good night, Clary."
Squidward says: "Tomorrow, we begin life anew."
Squidward says: "304 New Life street, Squidward speaking."
Squidward says: "Ahh."
Squidward says: "I think I'll take my bike today."
Squidette says: "Would you pipe down over there, iron lung?"
Squidward says: "Looks like when it comes to having fun, you don't have a "leg" to stand on!"
Squidette says: "Hey!"
Squidette says: "That's not funny!"
Octopus #1 says: "Yeah!"
Octopus #2 says: "What's going on over here?"
Squidette says: "It's that guy!"
Squidette says: "He's playing with a reef blower!"
Octopus #2 says: "Playing?"
Octopus #2 says: "With a reef blower?"
Octopus #2 says: "That's the most childish thing I've ever heard of!"
Squidward says: "But it's fun!"
Octopus #2 says: "How could you possibly have fun with one of those oversized hair dryers?"
Squidward says: "Like this!"
Octopus #2 says: "Give it back!"
Octopus #2 says: "Please!"
Squidward says: "Tag!"
Squidward says: "You're it!"
Octopus on bike says: "Wah!"
Squidette says: "What can I get you boys?"
Octopus says: "What are you looking at?"
Octopus #2 says: "Those."
SpongeBob says: "Here it is, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Now we've just got to convince Squidward to come back home."
SpongeBob says: "You got our apology cake?"
SpongeBob says: "We're ready!"
Patrick says: "Yay."
Guard says: "Hello, can I help you?"
Patrick says: "Can I get a large #1, extra size?"
SpongeBob says: "But you just ate three orders of fried oyster skins!"
Patrick says: "I love fried oyster skins."
Guard says: "We're sorry, but your kind isn't allowed here."
Patrick says: "I guess we've got to order inside."
SpongeBob says: "Hey!"
SpongeBob says: "That looked like Squidward!"
Policeman says: "Hold it right there, Mr."
Policeman says: "Tentacles!"
Squidward says: "Stand back!"
Squidward says: "I've got gardening tools!"
Policeman says: "Here!"
Policeman says: "Just read this!"
Squidward says: "What is it?"
Policeman says: "A well thought out and organized list of complaints!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, look!"
SpongeBob says: "It's Squidward!"
Male Octopus says: "Get off me, and i'm not Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Are you Squidward now?"
Squidward says: "Grievances?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "This town is a grievance!"
Squidward says: "There should be a law against so many stuck-up tightwads living in one place!"
Squidward says: "This city needs to be destroyed!"
Squidward says: "â€¦ or at least painted a different color."
Policeman says: "FYI, you don't have to live here, you know."
Squidward says: "Hey, you're right!"
SpongeBob says: "Are you Squidward?"
Male Octopus says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Are you Squidward?"
Squidette says: "No."
Patrick says: "Are you Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Any one of these Squidwards can be the real Squidward, Patrick!"
Squidward says: "Freedom!"
Squidward says: "Woo-hoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, we know one thing: it sure isn't that guy!"
