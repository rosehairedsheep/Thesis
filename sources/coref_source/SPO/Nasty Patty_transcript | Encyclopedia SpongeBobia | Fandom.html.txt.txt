Narrator says: "It's nights like these that remind me of the time Mr."
Narrator says: "Krabs and SpongeBob thought they killed a health inspector."
Mr. Krabs says: "If he finds one health violation, he'll close us down for good."
Mr. Krabs says: "We've got to do everything in our power to make sure he passes the Krusty Krab."
SpongeBob says: "But, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, there's no reason to worry."
SpongeBob says: "The Krusty Krab is the most perfect place in the universe."
Mr. Krabs says: "You really haven't got any brains at all, have you, son?"
SpongeBob says: "What can I get for you..."
SpongeBob says: "handsome?"
Mr. Krabs says: "We're doomed!"
Health Inspector Andy Yellowtail says: "I'm going to need you to bring me one of everything on the menu."

Health Inspector says: "So far, so good."
Health Inspector says: "I just need to try a plain Krabby Patty and my inspection will be finished."
SpongeBob says: "He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection!"
Johnny Elaine says: "We interrupt this can-can for a special news bulletin."
Johnny Elaine says: "Be on the lookout for a man, who's been passing himself off as a health inspector in order to obtain free food."
Johnny Elaine says: "That's all for now."
Mr. Krabs says: "FREE..."
Mr. Krabs says: "FOOD?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"

Mr. Krabs says: "We've been duped!"
SpongeBob says: "Duped!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Bamboozled!"
SpongeBob says: "We've been smeckledorfed!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's not even a word and I agree with ya!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Look at him."
Mr. Krabs says: "I bet he never changes his underpants."
SpongeBob says: "I bet he bites whale bubbles."
Mr. Krabs says: "I bet his mom bought him that hat."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're dancin' with the crab man now!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Join me, boy, or you're fired!"
SpongeBob says: "It doesn't seem right..."
SpongeBob says: "Seahorse radish: the gnarliest stuff in the ocean."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, hold on, I've got a jar of toenail clippings in my office!"
SpongeBob says: "Oops, I dropped it in the toilet!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, fish it out, and I'll dry it with me gym socks!"
SpongeBob says: "I call it the 'Nasty Patty'."
Health Inspector says: "Hey, hurry up with that patty!"
Health Inspector says: "Ah, hello, delicious."
Health Inspector says: "Come to papa."
Realistic Fish Head says: "We interrupt your laughter at other people's expense to bring you this news flash."
Realistic Fish Head says: "The fake inspector has been captured."
Realistic Fish Head says: "Here is his picture."
Realistic Fish Head says: "If a health inspector comes to your restaurant and he's not this guy, he's real."
SpongeBob says: "Phew, that's a relief, eh, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sure our guy will understand if we just explain the situation."
SpongeBob says: "Then we can all have a good laugh about it."
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't think he'll be laughing, boy."
SpongeBob says: "Why, sir?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Because that patty killed him!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, what are we gonna do?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's this "we" stuff?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You fed him the tainted patty."
Mr. Krabs says: "Looks like it's the stony lonesome for you!"
SpongeBob says: "But you told me to give it to him!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, you could've talked me out of it!"
SpongeBob says: "You're right, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I'm guilty."
SpongeBob says: "I'll never survive in prison, they'll mop up the floor with me."
Mr. Krabs says: "Get a hold of yourself, boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We've got to get rid of this body before anyone sees it."
Mr. Krabs says: "We've got to take it out and bury it."
Mr. Krabs says: "This should be far enough."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, get diggin'!"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "What's the holdup down there?"
SpongeBob says: "There's a big rock in the way!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, toss it out and get back to diggin'!"
Health Inspector says: "Oh..."
Health Inspector says: "where am I?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Something ain't quite right."
SpongeBob says: "What do you mean, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "His head's sticking out!"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I thought he might need some air."
Mr. Krabs says: "They don't need air where he's going."
SpongeBob says: "Shouldn't we say a few words on his behalf?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uhh, he was a credit to health inspectors everywhere, and, uh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Listen here, ya little barnacle."
Mr. Krabs says: "No one, and I mean no one can ever know about this."
Mr. Krabs says: "It'll be the end of you, it'll be the end of me."
Mr. Krabs says: "And worst of all, it'll be the end of me!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I'm too young to go to jail!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And what would be the charges?"

Mr. Krabs says: "Why?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Put him in the trunk, boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll keep them cops busy."

Mr. Krabs says: "Now listen, SpongeBob, when we get to the Krusty Krab I want you to take that  shovel and bring it around to the back entrance and stuff..."
Mr. Krabs says: "er..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I mean, stow it in the freezer."
Mr. Krabs says: "Un-der-stand?"

Mr. Krabs says: "There is no ice!"
Mr. Krabs says: "There's never been any ice."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ice is just a myth!"
Officer Nancy says: "Step aside."
Officer Nancy says: "You people act like you've committed a murder."
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I confess!"

SpongeBob says: "What?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "You can't pin this whole rap on me!"
Mr. Krabs says: "He was insane, out of control!"
Mr. Krabs says: "He would've killed me too if you two hadn't come along!"
SpongeBob says: "It was all Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs' idea!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Put him down now, he's a mad dog!"
SpongeBob says: "He wears curlers to bed!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's not what you think!"
Officer Nancy says: "What are you two talking about?"
Mr. Krabs says: "We killed the health inspector, buried him and then stuffed his body in the freezer!"
Officer Nancy says: "You mean in here?"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's empty?"
Officer Nancy says: "Is this some kind of a joke?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah..."
Mr. Krabs says: "a joke!"
Officer Nancy says: "Say, maybe he turned into a zombie and walked out."
Health Inspector says: "Hey, you guys..."
Officer Nancy says: "I'll take it from here."
Officer Nancy says: "Die, zombie!"
Officer John says: "Good police work, Officer Nancy."
Officer John says: "Hey, this guy's not a zombie."
