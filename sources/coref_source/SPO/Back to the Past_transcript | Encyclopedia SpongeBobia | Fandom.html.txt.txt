SpongeBob says: "Oh, boy!"
SpongeBob says: "Jellyfishing."
SpongeBob says: "I can't wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Can you, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Did you say something?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, I said..."
SpongeBob says: "Ow!"
Patrick says: "I'm not sure how to respond to that."
Barnacle Boy says: "Hey!"
Barnacle Boy says: "We're stuck here, remember?"
Mermaid Man says: "Why is that?"
Barnacle Boy says: "Because you forgot to fill up the boat mobile before we left."
Barnacle Boy says: "See?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, heroes!"
SpongeBob says: "Is there anything we can do?"
SpongeBob says: "So, is that it?"
Barnacle Boy says: "Yes."
Barnacle Boy says: "Uh, thank you, boys."
Barnacle Boy says: "We don't usually do this, but in term for pushing the invisiboat up all those hills, there's something I'd like you to see."
Barnacle Boy says: "But you must promise to not touch anything."
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
Patrick says: "Okay!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
Patrick says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, the magic claw from episode 1582!"
SpongeBob says: "Man Ray's power glove!"
Patrick says: "Ooh!"
Patrick says: "A pair of binoculars."
Mermaid Man says: "Yes, boys, this is our locker of memories."
Mermaid Man says: "It contains..."
Mermaid Man says: "Uh..."
Mermaid Man says: "I can't remember."
Barnacle Boy says: "It contains all the memorabilia up from our super-human adventures."
Patrick says: "Wow."
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob, check it out!"
SpongeBob says: "The Dirty Bubble's bubble wand!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Correct!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Scared, boys?"
SpongeBob says: "Mmm-hmm."
Patrick says: "Mmm-hmm."
Barnacle Boy says: "Well, don't be."
Mermaid Man says: "And as long as no one touches anything, there's nothing here to be scared of."
SpongeBob says: "Understood."
Barnacle Boy says: "And this is our time machine."
Barnacle Boy says: "This device allows us to transport into the future or past at a date or destination of our choosing."
SpongeBob says: "Ooh!"
Patrick says: "Ooh!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Unfortunately, the consequences of altering the order of history are so dangerous, we've chosen it to leave it alone, so you must not touch..."
Patrick says: "Hey, this snack machine took my quarter!"
Patrick says: "I want my crunchy munchities!"
Barnacle Boy says: "No!"
Patrick says: "Stupid box!"
Patrick says: "You really gotta get that thing fixed."
Barnacle Boy says: "You fool!"
Barnacle Boy says: "You realize what you've done?!"
Barnacle Boy says: "!"
Patrick says: "Well, I lost a quarter."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, where are we?"
SpongeBob says: "It can't be!"
SpongeBob says: "Bikini Bottom has at least 39 people living here!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Maybe as you knew it, but this is a different Bikini Bottom of another time."
Barnacle Boy says: "Maybe if you've hadn't touched the time machine like we told you, Patrick, we wouldn't be in this mess!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Hopefully, we hadn't changed anything with our presence."
Barnacle Boy points his finger at Patrick angrily as the latter shrinks back in fear.
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "Everything looks so old-fashioned."
Man Ray says: "I'm ready to rule the world and its riches!"
Man Ray says: "With this weapon, nothing can stop me!"
Young Mermaid Man says: "That's what you think."
Man Ray says: "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?!"
Man Ray says: "!"
Young Mermaid Man says: "Sorry, Man Ray."
Young Mermaid Man says: "But my stalwart companion Barnacle Boy and I beg to differ with you."
Young Barnacle Boy says: "You've tangled with the wrong end of the fishhook of justice, Man Ray."
Young Mermaid Man says: "Now prepare for a heaping helping of quick drying tartar sauce."
Mermaid Man says: "Wow, our bodies were so tight."
Barnacle Boy says: "What went wrong?"
Young Barnacle Boy says: "Jumpin' jellyfish, Mermaid Man, what happened to the tartar sauce?"
Patrick says: "Good thing that was around."
Patrick says: "I was starving."
Young Mermaid Man says: "Curious."
Young Mermaid Man says: "Could I have forgotten to refill it?"
Patrick says: "This is creeping me out!"
SpongeBob 1 says: "Patrick, what about Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?"
Patrick says: "I don't got time for that!"
Mermaid Man says: "Where are you going, boys?"
Patrick says: "I just want to go home!"
Barnacle Boy says: "When are we gonna have those two re-classified as villains?"
Mermaid Man says: "They left us here!"
Mermaid Man says: "What are we going to do?"
Mermaid Man says: "Eh, I'm sure it'll all work out."
Young Mermaid Man says: "Don't worry, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are always here to help the elderly."
Young Mermaid Man says: "There's something familiar about these two, Barnacle Boy."
Young Mermaid Man says: "I just can't put my flipper on it."
Young Barnacle Boy says: "Hey, neat hat!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Thanks, I..."
Barnacle Boy says: "uh..."
Young Mermaid Man says: "Let's get these poor defenseless seniors out of harm's way."
SpongeBob and Patrick are now seen screaming on their way back from the time machine.
Patrick says: "Well, that's more like it."
Patrick says: "Back in good old present day Bikini Bottom."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Patrick, we're all born in our old place in time."
SpongeBob says: "Hello, fellow citizen."
SpongeBob says: "Hello, Squilliam."
Squilliam says: "Man Ray is great."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
SpongeBob says: "Must be taking care of his community service obligations."
Patrick says: "That'll teach him to jaywalk."
SpongeBob says: "Say, uh, Patrick, do you notice anything different about our fair city?"
Patrick says: "Sorry, I couldn't hear you over the clatter of prison chains."
SpongeBob says: "I said, is there something odd about Bikini Bottom since we got back?"
Patrick says: "No."
Patrick says: "But yes!"
Patrick says: "Just look at the giant medicine billboard!"
Patrick says: "It's missing a bolt on the bottom right corner!"
SpongeBob says: "Even worse than that, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "The police got new uniforms!"
Patrick says: "Oh, no!"
Patrick says: "What did they do with those old ones?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "And yikes!"
SpongeBob says: "What happened to the Krusty Krab?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: ""The designated area where you are permitted by Man Ray, your ruler, to obtain sandwiches using Man Ray dollars"?"
SpongeBob says: "Do you see the under-lying tragedy in all this?"
Patrick says: "I'm all out of Man Ray dollars?"
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "It means we somehow changed the course of history when we went to the past."
SpongeBob says: "And now, in this reality, Man Ray is ruler."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, we got to do something."
Patrick says: "But what?"
SpongeBob says: "What any self-respecting citizen of the free world would do in a time of crisis."
SpongeBob says: "See if I still have a job!"
Man Ray says: "Hey, you’re not eating fast enough!"
SpongeBob says: "Excuse me, Squidw..."
Barnacle Boy says: "Yes?"
SpongeBob says: "Barnacle Boy?"
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing here?"
Barnacle Boy says: "Just getting stuck in a wasted life."
Mermaid Man says: "Order up!"
SpongeBob says: "Mermaid Man!"
SpongeBob says: "He's wearing a hairnet!"
SpongeBob says: "What happened?"
SpongeBob says: "Why are the two greatest heroes ever stuck in this greasy spoon, not combating the evils of Man Ray?"
Mermaid Man says: "I lost the desire and the physique to fight long ago, kid."
Mermaid Man says: "Flipping patties is so much easier on the joints when you're my age."
SpongeBob says: "What about the younger Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?"
SpongeBob says: "Surely, they refused to surrender without a fight."
Mermaid Man says: "You got spaghetti for brains, kid?"
Mermaid Man says: "We are the younger ones."
Mermaid Man says: "The older ones..."
SpongeBob says: "I am so sorry for your loss of..."
SpongeBob says: "yourself."
Barnacle Boy says: "I hate to break up the memorial service, but we're out of tartar sauce out here."
Mermaid Man says: "Tartar sauce?!"
Mermaid Man says: "!"
Mermaid Man says: "The topping that destroyed life as we knew it!"
Mermaid Man says: "If only my tartar sauce attack hadn't failed that day, we wouldn't be living in this wasteland!"
Mermaid Man says: "We're already out?"
Patrick says: "Yep."
Patrick says: "Chewy bits..."
Mermaid Man says: "I knew I recognize you from somewhere, you were there."
Mermaid Man says: "And you ate that tartar sauce on that day!"
Mermaid Man says: "Do you realize what you’ve done?!"
Mermaid Man says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Mermaid Man."
SpongeBob says: "We didn't mean to destroy your lives and everything you held dear."
SpongeBob says: "What do we say to try to make things right?"
SpongeBob says: "With your help, of course."
Mermaid Man says: "I'm not teaming up with you to do jack diddly squat!"
Mermaid Man says: "Besides, Man Ray had me by the neck!"
Mermaid Man says: "Oh, e-evil!"
SpongeBob says: "Does that mean the defeat was so traumatic that it has given Man Ray a stranglehold on your psyche?"
Mermaid Man says: "Barnacles, no!"
Mermaid Man says: "It means he put this electro-collar on me that won't allow me to leave the restaurant!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh."
SpongeBob says: "Let's get the nasty thing off of you."
Mermaid Man says: "Haven't you two idiots done enough damage?"
SpongeBob says: "I can't get a good grip on it!"
SpongeBob says: "I must need a better angle."
SpongeBob says: "Hold on."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, sorry."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick, can you give me a hand here?"
Mermaid Man says: "Keep away from me!"
SpongeBob says: "Ta-daaa!"
SpongeBob says: "You're free!"
SpongeBob says: "Can we coax you and Barnacle Boy out of retirement to save the your universe?"
Mermaid Man says: "I suppose you’ve proven your medal, kid."
Mermaid Man says: "But I'll have my eye on you two."
Mermaid Man says: "Now let's pop that Dirty Bubble!"
SpongeBob says: "Actually, we're fighting Man Ray."
Mermaid Man says: "Oh."
Mermaid Man says: "Well, in that case, let the lighthouse of justice shine on Ray Man!"
SpongeBob 1 says: "Okay, I suppose that's close enough."
SpongeBob 1 says: "Back to the past, gents, just stop you from eating the tartar sauce again for the first time."
SpongeBob 1 says: "Hmm."
Man Ray says: "I am ready to rule the world and its riches!"
Young Mermaid Man says: "Not so fast, Man Ray!"
Young Barnacle Boy says: "We've got a little surprise for you."
Second Old Mermaid Man says: "Keep your tongue out of the tartar sauce!"
Mermaid Man says: "Impostors!"
Second Old Mermaid Man says: "Who are you calling impostor, impostor?"
Second Old Mermaid Man says: "I must prevent our tartar sauce from being eaten by that fool!"
Mermaid Man says: "If I want to get near my tartar sauce I gotta to go through me first!"
Second Old Mermaid Man says: "I'm gonna make me eat those words!"
Mermaid Man says: "Bring it."
Mermaid Man says: "I'll never let you win."
Second Old Mermaid Man says: "Oh, yes, I will."
Young Mermaid Man says: "What do you make of this, Barnacle Boy?"
Young Barnacle Boy says: "Tangled timeline, Mermaid Man."
Man Ray says: "You old coots provided me the perfect distraction."
Man Ray says: "Now prepare to be disappeared!"
Young Mermaid Man says: "Sounds good on paper, you purveyor of pure evil, but, fortunately, we all know what happens to paper underwater."
Young Mermaid Man says: "Barnacle Boy, the tartar sauce."
Patrick 2 says: "Wow!"
Patrick 2 says: "I've never eaten that much tartar sauce."
Patrick 1 says: "Yes, you have."
Patrick 2 says: "Well, it sure ain't sittin' right."
SpongeBob 2 says: "Patrick, don’t eat the tartar sauce!"
Man Ray says: "You’re too late!"
Man Ray says: "Your fat friend beat you to it."
Man Ray says: "Now, prepare to taste laser!"
Man Ray says: "So how..."
SpongeBob 4 says: "I told you we had to go back farther!"
Man Ray says: "Uh..."
Third Mermaid Man says: "Up, up, and away!"
Man Ray says: "I can't get my head around this."
Man Ray says: "Where are they all coming from?"
Man Ray says: "Uh!"
Man Ray says: "I got to sit down and think this through."
Young Mermaid Man says: "Gotta!"
Young Mermaid Man says: "You've got plenty of time for thinking in the stony lonesome."
Man Ray says: "I'm sorry, did you say something?"
Man Ray says: "I'm still trying to comprehend what just happened here."
Young Mermaid Man says: "It's pretty simple, really."
Young Mermaid Man says: "You were defeated by a convoy of continuum-cruising crime stoppers."
Young Mermaid Man says: "Thank you, SpongeBob and Patrick."
Four SpongeBobs says: "You're welcome!"
Two Patricks says: "You're welcome!"
