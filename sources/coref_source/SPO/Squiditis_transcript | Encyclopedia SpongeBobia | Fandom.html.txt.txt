Squidward says: "My, what a beautiful day it is outside."
Squidward says: "Too bad I'm cooped up here in the Krusty Krab."
SpongeBob says: "Who are you talking to, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Just like I always seem to be on a nice sunny day."
SpongeBob says: "Look at it this way, Squidward: Things could always be worse."
Squidward says: "Worse?"
Squidward says: "How?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, uh..."
SpongeBob says: "Uh..."
SpongeBob says: "you could be sick."
Squidward says: "Sick?"
Squidward says: "Is that really any worse?"
SpongeBob says: "Being sick is awful!"
SpongeBob says: "The aches, the running nose, and the fever are bad enough."
SpongeBob says: "But that's not even the worst part."
Squidward says: "Oh, really."
SpongeBob says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "The worst part is missing a glorious shift here at the Krusty Krab."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Huh?"
Squidward says: "Oh, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "I'm suddenly not feeling very well."
SpongeBob says: "What's the matter?"
Squidward says: "Well, Uh."
Squidward says: "Let's see."
Squidward says: "Uh."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, what could it be?"
Squidward says: "I'm not sure."
Squidward says: "But I fear I might be coming down with a dreaded illness."
SpongeBob says: "Ah!"
SpongeBob says: "What is the name of this horrible illness?"
Squidward says: "Name?"
Squidward says: "Oh, uh."
Squidward says: "Per, swees, swer, squeer, uh, squid's disease."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Squidward says: "Squid's disease."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Squidward says: "Squid's disease!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I think the disease is affecting your temper."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob?"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "What are you doing back there?"
SpongeBob says: "I hate to be the bearer of bad news, Squidward, but I think the best thing for somebody in your condition would be to  go home and not come back until you're fully recovered."
Squidward says: "Well, SpongeBob,  I think you're probably right."
SpongeBob says: "I'm so sorry, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Well, I, I better go break the news to Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're sick?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, you don't look any sicker than you usually do."
Mr. Krabs says: "You know what."
Mr. Krabs says: "I better give you the old navy onceover just to be sure."
Squidward says: "The what?"
Mr. Krabs lifts Squidward's nose.
Mr. Krabs says: "Now open wide."
Squidward opens his mouth.
Squidward says: "Ow!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Forehead feels normal."
Mr. Krabs says: "Reflexes are a little slow."
Mr. Krabs says: "But I'd expect that from you."
Squidward says: "Wonderful."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward, in my expert opinion, you look fit as a fiddle."
Squidward says: "But, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabs nothing."
Squidward says: "But I..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabs nothing!"
Squidward says: "But..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabs nothing!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Just go ahead, I'm gonna keep saying it."
Squidward says: "And what about the customers?"
Squidward says: "You don't want them to get sick, do you?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No."
Mr. Krabs says: "And I don't want them to get hungry either."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, would you bring that order to table 3, puh-lease?"
SpongeBob says: "Right away, Squidward."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Turn around, please."
Squidward says: "And just what is that supposed to be?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, this."
SpongeBob says: "It's a number 2: Krabby Patty with cheese, medium drink..."
Squidward says: "Not that."
Squidward says: "Not that."
Squidward says: "The thing on your face."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, this."
Squidward says: "Yes."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, this is a precautionary measure in case should anyone in the workplace happens to fall ill, which in this case you have."
SpongeBob says: "Then I wear it to protect my body from spreading germs and bacterias."
Squidward says: "Hi, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Hello, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Could I see that?"
SpongeBob says: "Um, actually no."
Squidward says: "Because I find this all so very inte..."
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "resting."
SpongeBob takes off mask, screams, and runs into Mr. Krabs' office.
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Neptune's Knee-highs, lad!"
Mr. Krabs says: "How many times do I have to remind you to knock?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Mis..."
SpongeBob says: "ter..."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's better."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now what can I do you for?"
SpongeBob says: "It's Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "He's sick."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's funny."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're the second person today whose told me that."
SpongeBob says: "Who was the first?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "But I checked out that slimy green cashier personally, and if he's sick, then I'm the next mayor of Marmalade Mountain."
Mr. Krabs says: "Doesn't sound like a bad gig actually."
SpongeBob says: "But, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, you have to believe me."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward's got a horrible disease called Squid's Disease!"
SpongeBob says: "Scratchy throat, itchy eyes, dry mouth, fevers, and boils, and missed workdays!"
Fish says: "One Krabby Patty, please."
Mr. Krabs says: "Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward, got a minute?"
Squidward says: "Oh, of course."
Squidward says: "It's not like I'm busy working or anything."
Mr. Krabs says: "We've got a situation with the kid."
Mr. Krabs says: "Something's got him spooked."
SpongeBob is shown holding his nose and mouth tightly.
Mr. Krabs says: "He can't cook in this condition."
Mr. Krabs says: "No cookin, no patties."
Mr. Krabs says: "No patties, no money."
Squidward says: "And you're telling me this, why?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I need you to make yourself scarce for a while."
Squidward says: "So, you're telling me to go home?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, I don't care where you go, just as long as you get outta here!"
Squidward says: "Yippee!"
Squidward says: "Thanks, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Poor Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is..."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, everything all right in here?"
SpongeBob says: "Everything's fine, captain."
SpongeBob says: "Just a little, uh, howl for pleasure."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, how about a little less pleasure and a little more work?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh no!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You sure everything's alright?"
Frankie Billy says: "Do you guys hear what's going on?"
Harold says: "Yes, and I'm very puzzled."
Nat Peterson says: "So am I, in fact, I might even be a little concerned."
Harold says: "Well, I don't know if I'd go that far."
SpongeBob comes out of kitchen with trash covering him; crawls in front of Frankie Billy, Harold, and Nat Peterson and then lies on side.
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, I think I might be coming down with something."
Harold says: "Coming down with something?"
Nat says: "I refuse to be served by a sick fry cook."
Harold says: "Me too."
Harold says: "Let's get outta here!"
Frankie Billy says: "Good idea!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You look terrible."
SpongeBob says: "Thank you, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, I can't just stand by while me restaurant becomes a breeding ground for infection."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, go home."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's an order!"
SpongeBob says: "But who's going to run the restaurant?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Who's gonna run it?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I could run this place blindfolded with one claw tied behind me back."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll show ya."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Oh, no!"
Squidward says: "What happened to you?"
SpongeBob says: "I..."
SpongeBob says: "fell ill."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs won't let me work again until I'm better."
SpongeBob says: "Well, at least we can spend the day recovering together."
SpongeBob says: "After all, misery loves company."
SpongeBob says: "Right, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Well, so much for enjoying the great outdoors."
Squidward says: "But at least I can relax and enjoy  some afternoon tea."
SpongeBob says: "That sounds like a great idea, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, what have I told you about coming into my house?"
SpongeBob says: "I figured I can't make you well, Squidward, but I can at least make you comfortable."
SpongeBob says: "I brought hot compresses, tissues, the good kind with snail butter, and even a romantic comedy for us to watch."
SpongeBob says: "I know they're supposed to be funny, but they always make me cry."
Mr. Krabs says: "25 Krabby Patties!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Order up!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Order up!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Order up!"
Henry says: "Hey, I didn't order a table patty!"
Shubie says: "Yeah, or a window patty!"
Fish 3 says: "Or a face patty!"
Fish 3 says: "I want a refund!"
Television says: "Female: I love you Ted."
Television says: "Male: Ditto."
SpongeBob says: "Wasn't that great, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Oh, yeah, howdy."
Squidward says: "That's too bad it had to end."
Squidward says: "Finally."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, don't worry."
SpongeBob says: "We have all 99 sequels to watch next."
Squidward says: "Oh, would you look at that."
Squidward says: "I'm suddenly feeling much, much better."
Squidward says: "I think I'm going back to work now, bye."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "You're not well enough to return to work!"

SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Squidward says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I told you."
Mr. Krabs says: "I could run this place all by myself."
Mr. Krabs says: "Blindfolded with one claw tied behind me back."
SpongeBob says: "But, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, what are you doing here lying on the floor?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, SpongeBob, funny you should ask."
Mr. Krabs says: "Because in me expert medical opinion, I think I may be coming down with a nasty case of Squid's Disease."
SpongeBob says: "Squid's Disease?"
SpongeBob says: "I know just the cure!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Romantic Comedy?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "No!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ahh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get that thing away from me!"
