Mr. Krabs says: "I'm the real Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabs."
Imitation Krabs says: "Don't listen to him."
Imitation Krabs says: "He's obviously a robot."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, if I was a robot, which I'm not, at least I'm well put together."
Mr. Krabs says: "Not some rusted-out, steam-driven pile of junk!"
Imitation Krabs says: "Who are you calling steam-driven..."
Imitation Krabs says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "nobody gets hurt."
Mr. Krabs says: "Tartar sauce?!"

Mr. Krabs says: "$2."
Mr. Krabs says: "99!"
SpongeBob says: "On Wednesday..."
Imitation Krabs says: "99¢!"
SpongeBob says: "Right again!"
SpongeBob says: "Now only the really real Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs could answer this—"
SpongeBob says: "If we're discussing the secret formula on the third Wednesday in January and it's not raining outside after we've gargled with vanilla pudding, what do we do?"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's an easy one."

SpongeBob says: "If that was Plankton..."
SpongeBob says: "Uh-oh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Help!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get away!"
Mr. Krabs says: "No!"
