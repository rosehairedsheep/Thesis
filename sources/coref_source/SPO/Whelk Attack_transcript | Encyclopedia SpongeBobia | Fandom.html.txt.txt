A jellyfish swims peacefully and SpongeBob tries to catch it. Patrick chases a jellyfish, and SpongeBob twirls around. Patrick chases a bunch of jellyfish, and crashes into SpongeBob. While they were laughing, something makes an earthquake as the jellyfish swim away in fear.
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
SpongeBob says: "Do you think we caused an earthquake by hitting the ground too hard?"
Patrick says: "Maybe."
Patrick says: "Or maybe it's those guys."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I've never seen those guys around before..."
Patrick says: "Ewwww!"
Patrick says: "We're all covered in slime!"
SpongeBob says: "Not to worry!"
SpongeBob says: "I am a sponge after all!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, you're leaking."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, do you mind?"
SpongeBob says: "I've gotta wring myself out."
Patrick says: "Say no more."
SpongeBob says: "Ah!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "We've got to warn Bikini Bottom about those creatures!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, what do we do?"
Patrick says: "What are those things?"
SpongeBob says: "Whelks?"
SpongeBob says: "Heh, I'm not afraid of some goofy old sea snails!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hey, Gary!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Gary can be a little bit creepy."
Patrick says: "Well, I'm not afraid of them!"
Patrick says: "Watch this!"
Whelk says: "RRAWWWWWR!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what happened?"
Patrick says: "Can't talk, running!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, please let us in!"
Patrick says: "Squidward, please let us in!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, heh heh."
Patrick says: "Oh, heh heh."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Ravenous sea whelks are terrorizing Bikini Bottom!"
SpongeBob says: "They kinda look like Gary, but not really, and they spit purple slime!"
SpongeBob says: "And they're eating everyone!"
SpongeBob says: "They tried to eat me and Patrick, but we ran and we got away!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ravenous?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't care for Krabby Patties, huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, maybe there's something else on the menu you'd like!"
Patrick says: "Spon..."
Patrick says: "Spo..."
Patrick says: "Spo..."
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, use your words."
SpongeBob says: "Squid..."
SpongeBob says: "Squi..."

Squidward says: "Yep, that's one big mama."
Mr. Krabs says: "Welcome to The Krusty Krab!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm not on the menu!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, it swallowed Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Squidward says: "And this affects me, how?"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, what are we going to do?"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
Patrick says: "Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "Let us in, let us in, let us in!"

SpongeBob says: "We're not whelks!"
Patrick says: "We promise!"
Sandy says: "What's your mother's maiden name?"
SpongeBob says: "BubbleBottom!"
Sandy says: "Patrick, what's your first name?"
Patrick says: "Uh, is this a trick question?"
Sandy says: "I think I have the answer!"
Sandy says: "Now, do ya want the regular answer, or the action-packed answer?!"
Sandy says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, action-packed, please?"
Sandy says: "Yes!"
Sandy says: "I need a sample of their slime!"
Sandy says: "If I can analyze it, I may be deduce the cause of their aggressive behavior!"
Sandy says: "And maybe we can stop them!"
SpongeBob says: "Hmmmmm."
Patrick says: "Hmmmmm."
Sandy says: "Oh, no!"
Sandy says: "Come on, guys!"
Sandy says: "Follow me!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I guess this is end, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "You guys go, I'll hold them off."
Patrick says: "And if I failed, at least my sacrifice will be delayable!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't let you do that, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "I'll be the one to delay my life!"
Patrick says: "Okay, you go!"
Sandy says: "No, I'll go!"
Sandy says: "The whelks don't seem to be after land..."
Sandy says: "critters!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, look at that!"
Both says: "The Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "The gang's all here!"
Squidward says: "We're closed."
Squidward says: "Come back tomorrow."
Sandy says: "Hey, SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "Lend me your corneas for a second!"
Sandy says: "You too, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, okay."
Patrick says: "Oh, okay."
Sandy says: "Well, golly!"
Sandy says: "No wonder they're all grumpy!"
Sandy says: "Them whelks are full of germs!"
Sandy says: "They're sicker than a bull with the squirrel pox!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I know what to do!"
SpongeBob says: "After all, I've had the suds!"
SpongeBob says: "I just have to absorb the whelks' snot, and they'll return to normal!"
Mama Whelk says: "Meow."
