A horrible sound is heard, which turns out to be Squidward playing his clarinet until the doorbell rings. Dr. Gill Gilliam is at the door with a paramedic.
Dr. Gill Gilliam says: "Yeah, uhh, we're with the pet hospital down the street and I understand that you have a dying animal on the premises."
Squidward slams the door shut. The phone starts to ring.
Squidward says: "Hello."
Squidward says: "You've reached the house of unrecognized talent."
Squidward says: "Please start after the..."
Squilliam says: "Sounds like you've got a dying animal to attend to, eh, ol' chum?"
Squidward says: "Squilliam Fancyson from band class?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squilliam says: "I hear you're playing the cash register now."
Squidward says: "Sometimes."
Squidward says: "Uh, how's the unibrow?"
Squilliam says: "It's big and valuable."
Squilliam says: "I'm the leader of a big fancy band now, and we're supposed to play the Bubble Bowl next week."
Squidward says: "The ba-ba-ba..."
Squidward says: "The ba-ba-ba..."
Squidward says: "The ba-ba-ba?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squilliam says: "That's right."
Squilliam says: "I'm living your dreams, Squidward."
Squilliam says: "The problem is, I'm busy next week and can't make it."
Squilliam says: "So, I was hoping you and your band could cover for us."
Squidward says: "Ohh, uhh, I..."
Squidward says: "I, uhh..."
Squilliam says: "I knew it!"
Squilliam says: "You don't even have a band!"
Squilliam says: "Well, I'll just let you get back to the service industry now."
Squidward says: "Hold it!"
Squidward says: "It just so happens that I don't sell fast food, I do have a band, and we're gonna play that Bubble Bowl!"
Squidward says: "How do you like that, Fancy Boy?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squilliam says: "Good luck next Tuesday."
Squilliam says: "I hope the audience brings lots of..."
Squilliam says: "ibuprofen!"
Squilliam and Squidward hang up the phones.
Squidward says: "I gotta drum up a marching band fast!"
Squidward says: "Drum..."
Squidward says: "haha..."
Squidward says: "band humor."
In the following lines, Sandy, Plankton, Mrs. Puff, Mr. Krabs, and Larry are reading from a poster. Each are in different locations.
Sandy says: "Looking to add fulfillment to your dull, dull life?"
Plankton says: "Then become part of the greatest musical sensation to ever hit Bikini Bottom."
Mrs. Puff says: "And be forever adored by thousands of people you don't know."
Mr. Krabs says: "Not to mention free refreshments."
Larry says: "Practice begins tonight."
Larry says: "8:30 sharp."

Squidward says: "Stupid music rental clerk made me late."
Squidward says: "That trilobite didn't know an oboe from an elbow."
Squidward says: "Elbow, heh, more band humor."
The scene cuts to inside the room, where everyone is there.
All says: "Blah, blah, blah, blah..."
Squidward says: "People, people, settle down!"
Squidward says: "Okay, now."
Squidward says: "How many of you have played musical instruments before?"
Plankton says: "Do instruments of torture count?"
Squidward says: "No."
Patrick says: "Is mayonnaise an instrument?"
Squidward says: "No, Patrick, mayonnaise is not an instrument."
Squidward says: "That's fine."
Squidward says: "No one has any experience."
Squidward says: "Fortunately, I have enough talent for all of you."
Squidward laughs. Everyone stays silent.
Mr. Krabs says: "When do we get the free food?"
Squidward says: "Okay, try to repeat after me."
Squidward says: "Let's just try stepping in the rhythm."
Squidward says: "Now I want everyone to stand in straight rows of five."

Sandy says: "Ow!"
Sandy says: "Why, you..."
Sandy says: "!"
Sandy says: "Why I oughta..."
Sandy says: "!"
Patrick says: "Aaaaaah-ho-ho-ho-ho-aaah!"
Patrick says: "Whoever is the owner of the white sedan, you left your lights on."
Patrick walks in and it is revealed that Sandy has stuck his body in a trombone. Trombone notes are heard as he walks towards his seat. As he sits down, he makes a sound on his trombone. Makes a loud trombone noise as he opens his mouth. Stares at himself.

Squidward says: "Bubble Bowl, here we come."
Squidward says: "Flag twirlers, really spin those things."
Squidward says: "Okay, turn."
Squidward says: "Flag twirlers, let's go."
Squidward says: "I wanna see some spinning."
Squidward says: "Flag twirlers, let's move!"
Squidward says: "C'mon, move!"
The flag twirlers spin so hard that they take off into the sky and crash into a blimp, which causes an explosion. Nat plays Taps while everyone mourns, except Squidward, who just lies down on the ground and curls into a fetal position.
Narrator says: "Day three."
Squidward says: "How's that harmonica solo coming, Plankton?"
Plankton says: "It's tremendous, you wanna see?"
Plankton plays the harmonica by running to and from the holes quickly, but soon runs out of breath; on his way to the last hole he blows an unsuccessful last raspberry into the harmonica and faints.
Narrator says: "Day four."
Squidward says: "Well, this is our last night together before the show."
Squidward says: "And I know that you haven't improved since we began..."
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "but I have a theory."
Squidward says: "People talk loud when they wanna act smart, right?"
Plankton says: "Correct!"
Squidward says: "So, if we play loud, people might think we're good."
Squidward says: "Everybody ready?"
Squidward says: "And a one, and a two, and a one, two, three, four!"
Squidward says: "Okay, new theory."
Squidward says: "Maybe we should play so quietly, no one can hear us."
Harold says: "Well, maybe we wouldn't sound so bad if some people didn't try to play with big, meaty claws!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What did you say, punk?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Harold says: "Big..."
Harold says: "meaty..."
Harold says: "claws!"

The band members walk to the door where Squidward slams it open.

Squidward says: "I'll just tell them you all died in a marching accident."
Squidward says: "So, thanks."
Patrick says: "You're welcome."

SpongeBob says: "Evelyn, when your little Jimmy was trapped in a fire, who rescued him?"
Evelyn says: "A fireman."
SpongeBob says: "And Larry, when your heart gave out from all those tanning pills, who revived you?"
Larry says: "Some guy in an ambulance."
SpongeBob says: "Right."
SpongeBob says: "So, if we can all just pretend that Squidward was a fireman, or some guy in an ambulance, then I'm sure that we can all pull together and discover what it truly means to be in a marching band."
Harold says: "Yeah, for the fireman!"
All says: "Hooray!"
SpongeBob says: "Now let's make Squidward proud."
SpongeBob says: "A 1, a 2, a skiddly diddly doo."

Squilliam says: "So, where's your band?"
Squidward says: "Uh, they couldn't come."
Squidward says: "They..."
Squidward says: "died."
Squilliam says: "Then who's that?"
Squidward says: "That would be my band!"
SpongeBob says: "We're ready to perform, Squidward."
Squilliam says: "Well, Squiddy, this is exactly how I pictured your band would look."
SpongeBob dances.
Squidward says: "That's his..."
Squidward says: "eager face."
Squilliam laughs while they all go into the Bubble Bowl.
Squidward says: "I guess this will be the last time I can show my face in this town."

Squidward says: "1, 2, 3, 4..."
The band starts to play a wonderful intro. Squidward opens his eyes, shocked. SpongeBob begins singing.
SpongeBob says: "â™ªAnd it's sweet, sweet, sweet victory, yeah."
SpongeBob says: "And the one who's last to fall."
SpongeBob says: "We'll have sweet, sweet victory..."
