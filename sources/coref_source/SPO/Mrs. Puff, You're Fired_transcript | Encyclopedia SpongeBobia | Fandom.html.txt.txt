At Mrs. Puff's Boating School.
Mr. Gunther Fitz says: "Morning, Mrs."
Mr. Gunther Fitz says: "Puff."
Mr. Gunther Fitz says: "I'm Mr."
Mr. Gunther Fitz says: "Fitz."
Mr. Gunther Fitz says: "I represent the 'Boating Teachers Accreditation Bureau'."
Mr. Gunther Fitz says: "As you know, your teaching certificate is up for renewal."
Mr. Gunther Fitz says: "However, we have noticed there have been an unusually large amount of failings from this classroom."
Mrs. Puff says: "That's impossible."
Mrs. Puff says: "In all my years of teaching, only one student has failed my class."
Mr. Fitz says: "Yes, but he's failed 1,258,056 times."
Mrs. Puff says: "You don't understand."
Mrs. Puff says: "SpongeBob is unteachable."
Mr. Fitz says: "We cannot blame the students for the incompetence of the teacher."
SpongeBob says: "Honk honk!"
SpongeBob says: "Beep beep!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm ready to drive."
SpongeBob says: "Are you ready for my driving test today, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff?"
Mr. Fitz says: "Okay, Mrs."
Mr. Fitz says: "Puff, if SpongeBob fails this test, you will be replaced."
Mrs. Puff says: "Okay, SpongeBob, let's demonstrate for Mr."
Mrs. Puff says: "Fitz everything I've taught you in boating school."
Mrs. Puff says: "Now, what's the first thing we do before we start boating?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Then what do you do?"
SpongeBob says: "Start the engine?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Yes."
SpongeBob says: "What do I do now?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Drive the boat."
SpongeBob says: "Did I pass this time, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff?"
Mrs. Puff says: "No, SpongeBob, you failed."
SpongeBob says: "I failed?"
Mr. Fitz says: "It's not you that failed, SpongeBob."
Mr. Fitz says: "It's Mrs."
Mr. Fitz says: "Puff that's failed you."
Mr. Fitz says: "You are relieved of your teaching duties."
Mrs. Puff says: "I won't be teaching SpongeBob anymore?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Free at last!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Free at last!"
Sergeant Sam Roderick says: "Hello, worthless students."
Sergeant Sam Roderick says: "I'm your new instructor."
Sergeant Sam Roderick says: "No one's ever failed my class..."
Sergeant Sam Roderick says: "that's lived through it."
Sergeant Sam Roderick says: "I can assure you these next 4 weeks will be the worst years of your miserable lives."
Sergeant Sam Roderick says: "Your spine will break, your teeth will ache, your eyes will be bloodshot."
Sergeant Sam Roderick says: "You will drive out of this school in style."
Sergeant Sam Roderick says: "Or you will be carted out in your granny's hand basket."
Sergeant Sam Roderick says: "Everyone will follow the rules of the class."
Sergeant Sam Roderick says: "First rule: No talking."
Nat says: "Does that mean..."
Roderick says: "Second Rule: no eating in my class."
Roderick says: "Would anyone care for a bon-bon?"
Monroe says: "Uhh, I'll eat one."
Roderick says: "Pick your favorite."
Roderick says: "How's it taste?"
Monroe says: "It's a delightful taste sensation."
Roderick says: "No eating in my classroom!"
Roderick says: "Looks like you're the man, Sponge."
SpongeBob says: "I am?"
Roderick says: "Do you wanna learn how to drive or what?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, sir!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm ready to drive."
Roderick says: "What do you think you're doing?"
SpongeBob says: "Ready for my test, sir."
Roderick says: "most grueling driving course ever devised."
Roderick says: "You will learn every turn, bump, and crack on it."
Roderick says: "You'll start out crawling it."
SpongeBob says: "Crawl?"
Roderick says: "Hut two."
Roderick says: "Hut two."
Roderick says: "Hut two."
Roderick says: "Hut two."
SpongeBob says: "Left turn."
SpongeBob says: "Crack."
SpongeBob says: "Bump."
SpongeBob says: "Nickel."
SpongeBob says: "Hey a nickel!"
Roderick says: "Keep your eyes on the road, cadet."
SpongeBob says: "Pebble!"
Roderick says: "I'm ashamed of you, cadet."
Roderick says: "What are you suppose to be learning in my class?"
SpongeBob says: "How to drive, sir?"
Roderick says: "Affirmative."
Roderick says: "But before you learn to drive, you must learn to crawl."
Roderick says: "And then you learn to walk and then you learn to run."
Roderick says: "But before you learn to walk, you must learn to crawl."
SpongeBob says: "Sir, yes, sir!"
Roderick says: "Now get out there!"
Roderick says: "I'm impressed, son."
Roderick says: "Put it back together again!"
SpongeBob says: "That'll be easy."
Roderick says: "Are you sure?"
SpongeBob says: "Um, yeah."
SpongeBob says: "You just put the jigamahoo on the doohicky and uhh..."
Roderick says: "Jumpin' jellyfish..."
SpongeBob says: "Watch for pedestrians."
SpongeBob says: "Check mirrors."
SpongeBob says: "Observe that speed limit."
SpongeBob says: "Watch for pedestrians!"
SpongeBob says: "So, umm, how'd I do?"
Roderick says: "How'd you do?"
Roderick says: "Why don't you ask the shattered remains of this pedestrian..."
Roderick says: "how you did!"
SpongeBob says: "Now I know this forwards, backwards, and sideways."
SpongeBob says: "Am I ready to get behind the wheel?"
Roderick says: "Not quite."
Roderick says: "Now do it blindfolded."
SpongeBob crashes through another pedestrian off-screen.
Narrator says: "Several days later..."
SpongeBob says: "1003, 1004, 1005."
SpongeBob says: "Old lady with a ham sandwich."
SpongeBob says: "1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1..."
SpongeBob says: "13."
Roderick says: "Congratulations."
Roderick says: "You're ready to get behind the wheel."
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm ready!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm ready."
SpongeBob says: "I'm..."
Roderick says: "Let's see what I taught you, laddy."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, sir!"
SpongeBob says: "Nice boy."
Roderick says: "Nice driving."
Roderick says: "Now parallel park up ahead."
Roderick says: "Now, boy, the time has come to show Mr."
Roderick says: "Fits what you've learn."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, sir!"
SpongeBob says: "Step 1: seatbelts."
Roderick says: "Excellent work, cadet."
Roderick says: "What's next?"
SpongeBob says: "Step 2 would be..."
SpongeBob says: "ignite engine."
Roderick says: "Step 3?"
SpongeBob says: "Step 3 would be..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "engage blindfold."
Roderick says: "What?"
Roderick says: "You can't drive a boat with a blindfold on."
Roderick says: "That's illegal."
SpongeBob says: "But I can't do it without a blindfold."
Roderick says: "Drive, boy!"
Roderick says: "Drive!"
SpongeBob kicks down on the gas pedal and the boat is off. At the first turn is a giant red canister labeled "GAS." SpongeBob fails to make the right turn and instead crashes right into the gas can, obliterating the boating school faculty in a mushroom-radius explosion, and sending debris from the boating school sign, etc., flying everywhere. As the debris begins to clear, the boat flies into the air and goes soaring.
Roderick says: "Mayday!"
Roderick says: "Mayday!"
Roderick says: "You're off course."
Mrs. Puff says: "Ah, I feel so serene now that I'm away from that homicidal maniac, SpongeBob."
Roderick says: "The brake son!"
SpongeBob says: "Aye aye, sir."
SpongeBob says: "There you go, sir."
SpongeBob says: "All I had to do was unscrew two of the bolts."
Roderick says: "I'm gonna stop this thing."
Roderick says: "Tell my wife I love her."
SpongeBob says: "Man down."
SpongeBob says: "Man down."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, excuse me."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry."
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Patrick, I can't stop the boat right now."
SpongeBob says: "I can't see!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't see!"
Patrick says: "My pants!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, I can't see!"
SpongeBob says: "Did I pass?"
Mr. Fitz says: "Well, if there was a 'destroy the city' part of the test, you would have."
Patrick says: "The nerve of some people."
Mr. Fitz says: "Sorry, SpongeBob, you failed again."
Mr. Fitz says: "Even our finest instructor could not teach you."
Mr. Fitz says: "Mrs."
Mr. Fitz says: "Puff, you're hired again."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff!"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry I'm "unteachable"."
Mrs. Puff says: "It's okay."
Mrs. Puff says: "Mr."
Mrs. Puff says: "Fitz gave me my teaching certificate back."
Mrs. Puff says: "so it's as if you never failed."
SpongeBob says: "I got you a welcome back gift, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff."
SpongeBob says: "I found all the pieces and glued them back together."
SpongeBob says: "I promise it won't take me a million tries this time."
Mrs. Puff puts her head down on her desk and begins to sob quietly, and the name tag shatters as the episode ends.
