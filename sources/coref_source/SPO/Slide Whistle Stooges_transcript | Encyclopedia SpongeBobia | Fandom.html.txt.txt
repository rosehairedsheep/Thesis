Squidward lifts up the mat.
SpongeBob says: "What is the meaning of this?"
SpongeBob says: "We're slide whistling."
Squidward says: "Don't you mean, "Playing the slide whistle?"

Squidward says: "I don't need zest!"
Squidward says: "I need you out of my lampshade!"
Squidward says: "Get out of there!"
SpongeBob floats through the air with the slide whistle noise and out the door.
Squidward says: "Grrrrr..."

Squidward says: "Well, uh..."
Squidward says: "ha..."
Squidward says: "that is true..."
SpongeBob says: "Come, play some more, maestro."

Intercom says: "Dr."
Intercom says: "Forrest?"
Purple Doctorfish says: "Your friend is very lucky."
Purple Doctorfish says: "If it wasn't for that slide whistle getting lodged in his throat, the rescue team might have never found him."
Purple Doctorfish says: "His yelling, or whistling, I should say, under all that rubble, saved his life."
SpongeBob says: "Doctor, why did you leave the whistle in his throat?"
Purple Doctorfish says: "Unfortunately, we don't have the technology to remove it yet."
Purple Doctorfish says: "But on the bright side, he can still communicate with us."
The slide whistle starts going crazy again. Squidward is actually moving the slide whistle in a fit of anger, attempting to scream at SpongeBob and Patrick.
SpongeBob says: "Wow, Squidward, listen to you!"
SpongeBob says: "You're getting better already!"
SpongeBob says: "Here, we'll help."
