Patrick says: "Poor guy."
Patrick says: "Hey, check out Squidward's new snail."
SpongeBob says: "Fancy."
SpongeBob says: "So that's what came in the mail."
SpongeBob says: "Looks like Gary has a new little playmate."
Squidward says: "Pfft, dream on, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "I wouldn't let Snellie here play with that mongrel mutt."
Squidward says: "She's a purebred."
Patrick says: "Wow, a snail made out of bread."
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "Purebred means she is of the highest pedigree."
Squidward says: "See?"
Squidward says: "She even has her own papers."
Squidward says: "So if you'll excuse us, Snellie has to start her training."
SpongeBob says: "Training?"
Squidward says: "For Bikini Bottom's snail race."
Squidward says: "Snellie will be winning this Sunday."
Patrick says: "Sunday?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I guess I can't enter Gary in that."
SpongeBob says: "Sunday's laundry day!"
Squidward says: "No, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "You can't enter Gary because Gary's a mutt."
SpongeBob says: "Boy, you got that right."
SpongeBob says: "Gary's no..."
Squidward says: "Papers."
Patrick says: "Hmmm."
Patrick says: "'Property of Squidward..."
Patrick says: "Tentpoles."
Squidward says: "That's Tennisballs..."
Squidward says: "de-derr, Tentacles!"
Squidward says: "Come on, Snellie."
SpongeBob says: "You know what?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm starting to get the idea that Squidward thinks his snail is better than mine."
Patrick says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Patrick says: "Yeah, I should get a snail and enter it in that race and beat Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Sandy says: "Hmm..."
Sandy says: "I don't know why, but I think I'll kick SpongeBob's butt tomorrow."
SpongeBob says: "Kelp powder for muscle mass."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Of course, I expect you to eat this."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, pretty good time."
Patrick says: "Hey SpongeBob, check out my new snail."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, your snail is a rock."
Patrick says: "Yeah, thanks, I know."
Patrick says: "He's got nerves of steel."
Patrick says: "See you at the big race."
SpongeBob says: "Boy, the competition's getting tough."
SpongeBob says: "We are going to start some serious training right now."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Come on Gary, the big race is tomorrow."
SpongeBob says: "You got to start training if you want to win."
Squidward says: "Don't waste your breath, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "That mongrel of yours doesn't have a chance against Snellie."
Squidward says: "Patrick, that's a rock."
Patrick says: "Yeah, thanks."
Patrick says: "I know."
Patrick says: "He's got nerves of steel."
Squidward says: "What are you standing on, anyway?"
Patrick says: "My snail's really got Squidward scared, huh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Patrick, Gary and I have got some serious work to do."
Patrick says: "You can run, but you can't hide, SquarePants!"
SpongeBob says: "Alright, Gary, no more fooling around."
SpongeBob says: "Time to get serious."

Announcer says: "Lightning Larry Luciano, a living legend, slowly making his way center stage."

Announcer says: "He's almost a quarter of the way there."
Mayor says: "The torch is lit!"
Mayor says: "Let the race begin."
Squidward says: "Well, SpongeBob, I must admit, I didn't think that mongrel mutt of yours would even find the starting line."
Squidward says: "Congratulations."
SpongeBob says: "Save it for the Loser Circle, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Gary happens to be in the best shape for the rest of his life."
Squidward says: "I'll alert the paramedics."
Patrick says: "Good one, Squidward."
Official says: "You guys ready?"
Patrick says: "A burglar!"
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick, that's the official."
Official says: "We're ready to start here, folks."
Squidward says: "Okay, Snellie, let's show these common, garden-variety snails what superior breeding is all about."
Snellie says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Alright, Gary, listen up, the competition is going to be fierce."
SpongeBob says: "You're the undersnail."
SpongeBob says: "Everybody's already counting you out."
SpongeBob says: "Now get out there and win, so we can rub Squidward's big fat nose in it."
Gary says: "Meow."
Patrick says: "This is what you've been training for, Rocky."
Patrick says: "This is why we're here."
Official says: "On your mark."
Official says: "Get set."
Announcer says: "And they're off!"
Announcer says: "Number six, Snellie, rockets out of the starting blocks, leaving the other two competitors in the dust!"
SpongeBob says: "What?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Squidward says: "Go, Snellie, you got it, baby!"
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing, Gary?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "The race has started!"
SpongeBob says: "You let Snellie take the lead!"
SpongeBob says: "Let's go, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "Start moving!"
SpongeBob says: "You're blowing everything we trained for!"
SpongeBob says: "Blowing it!"
Patrick says: "It's okay, Rocky."
Patrick says: "You go when you feel like it."
SpongeBob says: "Gary, are you listening to me?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Get the anchors out of your pants right now!"
SpongeBob says: "Go, go, go, go, go!"
Announcer says: "And there goes number 7 out of the starting gate."
Announcer says: "Oh, hang on, folks."
Announcer says: "He doesn't look so good."
SpongeBob says: "Not good enough, Gary, not good enough!"
SpongeBob says: "Faster!"
Announcer says: "I do not like the look of this."
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Gary, it's a race!"
SpongeBob says: "A race!"
SpongeBob says: "Have you heard of 'em?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Announcer says: "That coach is pushing that snail too hard!"
SpongeBob says: "Faster, Gary, faster, faster, faster, faster!"
Announcer says: "Oh, looks like number 7 has a blowout!"
Announcer says: "Oops, make that two, folks."
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, Gary?"
Announcer says: "Plus, a blown head gasket!"
Announcer says: "Oh, and the poor creature's still going for it."
Announcer says: "He's losing control!"
SpongeBob says: "You can take a break now if you want to, Gary."
Announcer says: "He's spinning out of control!"
SpongeBob says: "NOOOOOOOOO!!!"
Announcer says: "Whoa."
Announcer says: "One of the coaches seems to have raced onto the track."
Announcer says: "That is an automatic disqualification."
Announcer says: "Looks like number six has this race all wrapped up, ladies and gentlemen."
Squidward says: "Come on, Snellie, it's all you, baby!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Gary, I'm sorry!"
SpongeBob says: "Why didn't you just say I was pushing it too hard?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "You did?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Gary, why didn't you tell me I wasn't listening?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "You did?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Gary!"
Snellie says: "Meow."
Squidward says: "What?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Gary?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
Crowd says: "Aww!"
SpongeBob says: "Looks like you and I are in-laws, eh, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "But that's impossible."
Squidward says: "If Snellie didn't win, then..."
Announcer says: "And the winner is Rocky!"
Squidward says: "I can't believe it."
Squidward says: "My purebred, which cost me $1,700, lost to a rock."
Patrick says: "Don't worry, Squidward, I know how much you wanted to win, so I had the trophy engraved to you."
Squidward says: "Gosh, Patrick, thanks."
Sandy says: "That's for yesterday, SquarePants!"
