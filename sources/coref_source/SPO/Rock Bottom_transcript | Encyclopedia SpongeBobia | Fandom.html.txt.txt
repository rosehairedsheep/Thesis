At Glove World! Where SpongeBob and Patrick are standing outside the amusement park.
Bus Driver says: "Ahem."
SpongeBob says: "Let me get my wallet."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Do you have any change?"
Patrick says: "How much do you need?"
SpongeBob says: "How much is it?"
Bus Driver says: "Fifty cents."
SpongeBob says: "Fifty cents."
Patrick says: "Nope."
Bus Driver says: "Forget it!"
SpongeBob says: "What did you say?"
Bus Driver says: "Just take your seat!"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, mister."
Patrick says: "Show me what you got at Glove World!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
SpongeBob says: "Here's my glove light."
Patrick says: "Wow..."
Patrick says: "I got gloves for my glove action-figure!"
SpongeBob says: "Cool!"
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Where's 'Leaving Bikini Bottom'?"
SpongeBob says: "Where did you see that?"
Patrick says: "We just passed the sign."
Patrick says: "'You are now in Leaving Bikini Bottom'."
Patrick says: "What's wrong, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I think we're on the wrong..."
SpongeBob says: "But, sir, we need to get back to Bikini Bottom."
Patrick says: "What is this, SpongeBob?"
Green Soil says: "Would you..."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, I don't like it here."
Patrick says: "It's dark and scary."
Patrick says: "I don't wanna be here."
Patrick says: "I wanna go home."
Patrick says: "Look, I can't even tell the bathrooms apart!"
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, that's an easy one, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "We just wait for somebody to come out and then you'll know."
Patrick says: "I still can't read the sign!"
Patrick says: "I wanna go home!"
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, uhh, okay."
SpongeBob says: "You wait for the bus."
SpongeBob says: "Call me when it comes."
SpongeBob says: "I'm gonna get a bus schedule."
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob, the bus is here!"
SpongeBob says: "I guess Grandpa SquarePants was right."
SpongeBob says: "Don't run for a bus."
Window Attendant says: "Next."
SpongeBob says: "Well, at least the line is moving."
Window Attendant says: "Next."
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
Window Attendant says: "Next."
SpongeBob says: "Finally!"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, I'm next!"
SpongeBob says: "When is the next bus to Bikini Bottom?"
Window Attendant says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "The bus schedule."
SpongeBob says: "The next bus."
Window Attendant says: "I can't..."
SpongeBob says: "The next bus..."
Window Attendant says: "Ohh."
Window Attendant says: "Goodnight!"
SpongeBob says: "Hold it, I'm not through here!"
SpongeBob says: "Ah, that's better."
The glove light stops working; short pause.
SpongeBob says: "This isn't your average everyday darkness."
SpongeBob says: "This is..."
SpongeBob says: "advanced darkness."
SpongeBob says: "Hey!"
SpongeBob says: "If I close my eyes, it doesn't seem so dark."
A raspberry is heard in the distance; he opens his eyes.
SpongeBob says: "Who's there?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Creature says: "You're welcome!"
Patrick says: "Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm coming back for ya!"
