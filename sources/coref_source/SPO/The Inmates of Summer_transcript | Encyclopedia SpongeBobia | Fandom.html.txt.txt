Note says: "Line in red is cut in Indonesia."
Scene takes place at the Bikini Bottom Dock & Shipyard ~according to the sign~, where some children are about to go on a trip to somewhere. We then see these children in colorful uniforms waiting in line for a boat. SpongeBob is seen in the uniform, but has piles of luggage. SpongeBob touches his stuff twice gently, and both times let out a small ding of clean-ness. He then claps his hands like he's playing the cymbals, to get rid of the dirt. We then hear a voice.
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, Patrick, I guess..."
Patrick says: "I'm going to miss you, buddy!"
SpongeBob says: "Me too, Patrick, me too!"
Patrick says: "Well, see you later, bud."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, that's it!"
SpongeBob says: "You can come with me to summer camp!"
SpongeBob says: "Then I'd never have to say goodbye!"
Patrick says: "Summer camp?"
Patrick says: "But I'm not even ready yet!"
SpongeBob says: "How about now?"
Patrick says: "Yep!"
Patrick says: "Weee!"
Patrick says: "Haha!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, and quarter, thanks!"
Warden says: "Welcome to Inferno Island!"
Warden says: "I have a very active imagination!"
Warden says: "Because it so happens that it is my sworn duty to think of fun things to do with the trash that society has thrown away!"
Warden says: "Holy fishpaste!"
Warden says: "We got ourselves a couple of "rabble rousers."
Warden says: "" What's your name, son?"
SpongeBob says: "SpongeBob SquarePants!"
Warden says: "And are you a rabble rouser?"
SpongeBob says: "Funny you should ask..."
SpongeBob says: "once I had..."
Warden says: "Well, I hope you aren't, because you sure look mighty tasty."
Warden says: "It isn't too soon after breakfast for me to want to chew somebody's head off!"
Patrick says: "Actually, I am a little hungry."
Warden says: "Hungry?!"
Warden says: "!"
Warden says: "Barney, fetch these two poor hungry souls a snack."
Warden says: "On the double!"
Prisoner #1 says: "Ohh."
Prisoner #1 says: "These guys are tough!"
Patrick says: "The food coma is setting in."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
SpongeBob says: "I could use a nap."
Warden says: "Did you just say nap?!"
Warden says: "!"
Warden says: "Well, I know the perfect place for you two to go digest that meal."
SpongeBob says: "This camp is very upscale!"
Patrick says: "I had no idea that they had a hot tub!"
Narrator says: "Three days later..."
Warden says: "Alright!"
Warden says: "Let them out!"
SpongeBob says: "It was quite an enjoyable soap, but it wasn't until this guy got thirsty and decided to drink the bath water!"
Patrick says: "Not bad!"
Patrick says: "Except for this aftertaste."
Warden says: "Shut your traps, all of you, because of that little outburst, I am going to treat you all to an activity so heart-wrenchingly boring, it physically exhausting, that it is guaranteed to render your souls broken beyond repair!"
SpongeBob says: "Yay!"
Patrick says: "Yay!"
SpongeBob says: "This is a pretty fun camp game, huh Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "It's made it even more fun and challenging by the fact that we're wearing these heavy ankle weights."
Patrick says: "What's wrong, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "The other campers just aren't having as much fun as you and me."
Patrick says: "If only we could think of some sort group activity that we can all do together, then we would all be having the same amount of fun as each other."
SpongeBob says: "That's it!"
SpongeBob says: "We'll show him we can be self-starters!"
Warden says: "Rise and shine!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh..."
SpongeBob says: "abomination?"
Warden says: "Who said that?"
SpongeBob says: "Me, sir!"
Warden says: "What is the meaning of this thing?"
SpongeBob says: "It's a play, for our amusement, and inspiration!"
Warden says: "Good."
Warden says: "Well then, I'll watch your play, and I will enjoy every act of your pathetic, meaningless, ridiculous, production."
Warden says: "You know why?"
Guard says: "Uhh..."
Guard says: "because you cherish the fine art of thespianism?"
Warden says: "No!"
Warden says: "Because this will be the last act you will ever perform in your pathetic lives!"
Warden says: "So, get to it!"
Warden says: "And I'd better be truly entertained!"
SpongeBob says: "Cool!"
Prisoner #2 says: "Kid's wasting his time."
SpongeBob says: "All done!"
Prisoner #2 says: "You thinking what I'm thinking?"
Prisoner #3 says: "Hmmmmm..."
Prisoner #2 says: "It's a boat, you simpleton!"
Prisoner #2 says: "What do boats do?"
Prisoner #3 says: "Umm..."
Prisoner #3 says: "make smoke?"
Prisoner #2 says: "No!"
Prisoner #2 says: "Hey, buddy!"
Prisoner #2 says: "Need some help?"
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
Prisoner #2 says: "Sure..."
Narrator says: "Opening Night."
One of the guards is holding popcorn and the Warden is holding a program that's labeled, "Play Bill". The curtain then rises, and we then see SpongeBob looking through a spies warden.
SpongeBob says: "Aye, for Jib's men, what forces blow the merry winds of Galilee?"
Prisoner #4 says: "Get ready!"
Prisoner #5 says: "Umm..."
Prisoner #5 says: "Oh!"
Prisoner #4 says: "♪'Tis we..."
Prisoners says: "♪..."
Prisoners says: "here to sing the song of merry time for all of day."

Prisoner #2 says: "♪Like a boat, upon the sea!"
Prisoners says: "♪Together!"
Prisoners says: "In happy camaraderie!"
Prisoners says: "Together!"
Prisoners says: "That's the way, it's ought to be!"

Prisoners says: "Together!"
Curtain goes down, and the show ends. Warden and the guards are now clapping and screaming with joy. One of them is throwing roses at the stage. Warden starts to cry.
Warden says: "I-I-I had never seen anything so beautiful..."
Prisoner #2 says: "Okay, let's do it!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh..."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, guys!"
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing?"
Prisoner #2 says: "We're breaking out of here, yeah, that's what!"
Prisoner #2 says: "Escaping!"
Prisoner #2 says: "Oh, uh, thanks for the convincing stage craft!"
Warden says: "Encore!"
Warden says: "Encore!"
Warden says: "Encore!"
Warden says: "Do it again!"
Prisoner #2 says: "Turn the ship around!"
Warden says: "I'm stuffed."
Warden says: "I can't even begin to imagine a punishment appropriate for what has happened here tonight!"
Warden says: "Words cannot attempt to describe the disgusting, vile, th-th-the complete disregard for the story tradition of musical theater."
Warden says: "So, starting this very moment, every one of you brontosauruses will be sentenced to..."
Camp Counselor says: "Ahoy!"
Camp Counselor says: "Hello?"
Camp Counselor says: "Yoo-who?"
Warden says: "What in the name of..."
Warden says: "For Neptune's sake, man, speak the King's English!"
Camp Counselor says: "I'm..."
Camp Counselor says: "I'm Camp Counselor Kraus from Sun Fun Island!"
Warden says: "Your who-what?"
Camp Counselor says: "Well, I was doing roll call and discovered one of my Sun-funners was missing!"
Camp Counselor says: "I came to take him back with me."
Camp Counselor says: "A..."
Camp Counselor says: "SpongeBob, eh, SquarePants?"
Warden says: "Enough!"
Warden says: "So tell me, Counselor, just what do they do on your Sunny Funny Island?"
Camp Counselor says: "Well, we, uh, make macaroni art..."
Warden says: "Egad."
Camp Counselor says: "And we sing campfire songs!"
Warden says: "Ahck!"
Camp Counselor says: "Oh, and we help and support each other."
Warden says: "STOP!"
Warden says: "These heinous activities sound like torture too severe for even the lowest, filthiest, undeserving..."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "/ SpongeBob?"
Patrick says: "/ SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "You first."
Patrick says: "I..."
Patrick says: "I like the other island better!"
SpongeBob says: "Me too!"
