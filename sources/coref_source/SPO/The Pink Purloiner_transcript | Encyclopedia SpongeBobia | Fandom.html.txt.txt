SpongeBob/Confess-A-Bear says: "Oh, maybe you should talk about it."
Patrick says: "Well, it involves my best friend SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "I don't think he knows what happened, but it would really upset him if he found out."

Patrick says: "What street said that?"
Patrick says: "Was it this one?"
Patrick says: "Mind your own business!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Star, I know that you are in possession of a rare jellyfishing net."
SpongeBob says: "I will pay one billion dollars for that net."
Patrick says: "I don't know who you are, but you're not getting this jellyfishing net!"
Patrick says: "I wouldn't sell it for a million dollars, not for a hundred dollars, I wouldn't even sell it for a dollar!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, really?"
Patrick says: "You can't have it for any price."
SpongeBob says: "And why not?"
Patrick says: "This means more to me than money."
Patrick says: "It's my friend SpongeBob's."
SpongeBob says: "A-ha!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Oh, thank goodness you're here."

SpongeBob says: "You said that it was your friend SpongeBob's!"
Patrick says: "Gift."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Patrick says: "It's my friend SpongeBob's gift."
Patrick says: "I made you a new net."
Patrick puts the TV in the pile.

Patrick says: "I'm not your best friend."
Patrick says: "I'm a no-good jelly netting thief fish!"
SpongeBob says: "Where are you going?"
Patrick says: "I'm leaving Bikini Bottom while I still have my dignity."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, no!"
SpongeBob says: "So, this is it?"
Patrick says: "Barring the unforeseen hand of fate, I'm afraid it is."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, don't go!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry I accused you!"
SpongeBob says: "It's bad enough I lost my net."
SpongeBob says: "I don't want to lose my friend, too."
SpongeBob says: "Please forgive me."
