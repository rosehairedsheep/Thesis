SpongeBob's alarm rings, his house blows toward Squidward's house, Squidward wakes up in dread, sand hands then cover the house's ears, then SpongeBob, in brown plaid, poses for one second then runs to Patrick's house.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Tee time, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Wake up!"
SpongeBob says: "Aw, how are we supposed to golf in this this downpour?"
SpongeBob says: "Our putters are getting waterlogged."
Patrick says: "Dumb rain!"
Patrick says: "Doesn't anybody know I'm the sheriff in these parts?"
Patrick says: "Aah!"
Squidward says: "If you two don't mind, could you keep it down to a low rumble?"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Squidward."
Patrick says: "Sorry, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I guess we were just too upset about the rain and how..."
Squidward says: "Don't care."
Frenchy says: "What follows is a brief construction montage."
Frenchy says: "We hope you enjoyed this brief construction montage."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hi, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Up from your slumber, I see."
SpongeBob says: "Well, you're just in time to endure in a friendly game of  indoor miniature golf!"
Squidward says: "I will not indulge in anything friendly or otherwise with the likes of you two."
Squidward says: "Presently, I am heading to enjoy a well-deserved morning nap."
Patrick says: "But we sculpted your likeness out of butter on hole five."
Squidward says: "I don't care!"
Squidward says: "Listen up, I will not be woken from my nap again, and if I am, I'm gonna..."
Patrick says: "Join us on the back nine?"
Squidward says: "Just don't let it happen again!"
Squidward says: "Or else."
SpongeBob says: "Let's get this game teed off."
SpongeBob says: "You're up first, my good man."
Patrick stretches, yawns, stomps, ululates.
Squidward says: "I am warning you two, keep it down!"
SpongeBob says: "Better tone down the calisthenics, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Don't wanna upset Squidward."
Patrick says: "Can't wait to lose, huh?"
Patrick says: "No!"
Patrick says: "Ooh."
Patrick says: "If you would just let me finish my stretches, I wouldn't have missed my first shot!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, don't worry, Patrick, I'm sure you'll get the hang of it."
Patrick says: "Nice shot."
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing?"
Patrick says: "Moving my ball."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you have to play it where it lands."
Patrick says: "Fine."
Patrick says: "Have it your way."
Patrick says: "Ready to give up?"
Patrick says: "Ha!"
Patrick says: "Let's see how you do against the windmill."
Patrick says: "You haven't got a chance."
SpongeBob says: "You know, Patrick, this is just a game."
Patrick says: "Oh, it is just a game, which I am gonna win."
SpongeBob says: "I think you're missing the point."
Patrick says: "Speaking of m-m-missing!"
Patrick says: "Yes!"
Patrick says: "See if you can top that!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
SpongeBob sweats and wipes his forehead, shoots, ball stops right before it's about to go in.
Bikini Bottomites says: "Aw."
Patrick says: "Looks like we're tied, three shots to three."
SpongeBob says: "Shots."
SpongeBob says: "They're called strokes in golf, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Not shots."
Patrick says: "Whatever."
Patrick says: "And he sinks another hole in one!"
Patrick says: "That's two in a row!"
SpongeBob says: "All right."
SpongeBob says: "You wanna play competitive, eh?"
SpongeBob says: "Observe."
SpongeBob says: "Right between the old wickets."
SpongeBob says: "Come on bally, don't fail me now."
Patrick says: "Watch out for the water hazard."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, the only hazard I can see is you standing in my shot."
Patrick says: "I have no idea what you're talking about."
SpongeBob says: "Fine."
SpongeBob says: "Be that way."
SpongeBob says: "I'll just go around you."
SpongeBob says: "Oops."
Patrick says: "Show-off."
Patrick says: "I can do that."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, where did our balls go?"
Patrick says: "Well, how do I know?"
Patrick says: "I was just copying you."
SpongeBob says: "Uh-oh."
SpongeBob says: "Oh well, I guess that's game point."
Patrick says: "Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho, hold on there, fella."
Patrick says: "It's not over yet."
SpongeBob says: "But remember what Squidward said?"
SpongeBob says: "We can't make any noise!"
Patrick says: "Who said anything about noise?"
Patrick says: "We're just gonna get outta the rough and back to the course!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "What's the big idea?"
SpongeBob says: "I thought we were in here to play golf, remember?"
Patrick says: "Okay, okay!"
SpongeBob says: "Now where is that darn ball?"
Patrick says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, have you seen by ball?"
Patrick says: "Was it a red one?"
SpongeBob says: "Mm-hmm."
Patrick says: "It might have been in the kelp salad."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you ate my ball?"
Patrick says: "Don't worry, I'll get it."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, no!"
Patrick says: "No?"
SpongeBob says: "I have to play the ball where it lies."
SpongeBob says: "Where's your ball?"
Patrick says: "I don't know."
Patrick says: "Gotta be around here somewhere."
SpongeBob says: "There it is!"
Patrick says: "Uh-oh."
SpongeBob says: "Play it where it lies."
Patrick says: "Hole in one!"
Patrick says: "Top that!"
SpongeBob says: "I could do that blindfolded."
Patrick says: "Wait up!"
Patrick says: "Warmer."
Patrick says: "Warmer."
Patrick says: "Red hot!"
SpongeBob says: "Aha!"
Patrick says: "Warmer."
Patrick says: "Warmer."
Patrick says: "Colder."
Patrick says: "Colder."
Patrick says: "Warmer."
Patrick says: "Warmer."
Patrick says: "Hot."
Patrick says: "Hotter."
Patrick says: "Red hot!"
Patrick says: "Red hot!"
Patrick says: "Wrong again."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick..."
Patrick says: "Stop peeking!"
Patrick says: "Hotter."
Patrick says: "Colder!"
Patrick says: "Hotter!"
Patrick says: "Hot!"
Patrick says: "Cold."
Patrick says: "Hot!"
Patrick says: "Cold."
Patrick says: "Hot!"
Patrick says: "Cool."
Patrick says: "Hot!"
Patrick says: "Cold."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "This is ridic-  -ulous."
SpongeBob says: "Wow."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward's really let this place go."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Aah!"
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing?"
Patrick says: "I was just freshening up."
Patrick says: "These fancy fixtures are touchy."
Patrick says: "Hot!"
Patrick says: "Red hot!"
Patrick says: "Ah!"
Patrick says: "Cold!"
Patrick says: "Cold!"
SpongeBob says: "Would you please get back in the game?"
Patrick says: "But I wanted to try his loofah."
SpongeBob says: "Those balls have gotta be around here somewhere."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Uhh, look a little closer, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "Play it where it lies?"
Patrick says: "Play it where it lies."
SpongeBob says: "But how are we gonna hit our balls back to my house from here?"
Patrick says: "All it takes is a little finesse, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "All it takes is a little finesse."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, you're good to go."
Patrick says: "Fore!"
Patrick says: "It's all yours."
SpongeBob says: "This one's for all the marbles."
Patrick says: "But I thought we weren't betting."
SpongeBob says: "No, I mean whoever wins this hole wins the game."
SpongeBob and Patrick shoot, landing Gary's food bowl, spilling on him.
SpongeBob says: "Hole in one!"
Patrick says: "Hole in one!"
SpongeBob says: "Good morning."
Patrick says: "Sorry we woke you."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward, what happened to your dentures?"
Patrick says: "Good game, pal."
SpongeBob says: "Rematch next Saturday?"
Patrick says: "Rain or shine, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "Rain or shine."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob?!"
Squidward says: "!"
