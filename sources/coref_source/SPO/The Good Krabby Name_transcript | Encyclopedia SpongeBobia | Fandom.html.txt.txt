Episode starts with Mr. Krabs taking pictures of people passing by, grunting as he does so.
Mr. Krabs says: "I gotcha!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Whoa!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're a big one!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Can't believe I've never seen you in the Krusty Krab before!"
Scene cuts to Squidward spraying the load bearing beam inside of the restaurant.
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "I haven't seen Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs all morning."
SpongeBob says: "Do you know where he is?"
Squidward says: "Don't know."
Squidward says: "Don't care."
Mr. Krabs comes to the inside of the restaurant and accidentally crushes Squidward.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, there you are, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Where have you been?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I've been conducting a little market research!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Where's Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Present!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You two!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Follow me!"
Squidward and SpongeBob follow Mr. Krabs into his office.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, wow!"
SpongeBob says: "You've been busy, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "I want you to take a look at these folks right here."
Mr. Krabs says: "Have you ever seen any of 'em in the Krusty Krab?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Think hard?"
SpongeBob says: "Uuuummmmm, hmm."
SpongeBob says: "Um, no, no, no, no, possibly, no, maybe, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and no."
SpongeBob says: "No, sir, I do not recognize any of them, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "How about you, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "I try not to look directly at the customers."
Mr. Krabs groans and gets a chart.
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, according to my research, a full 2% of the population of Bikini Bottom has never set foot in the Krusty Krab."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's 2% of money that's not in me pocket."
Mr. Krabs says: "And when I think about that 2%, I get soooooo maaaad!"
SpongeBob says: "When I see that 2%, I think of pie!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm not talking about pie!"
Mr. Krabs says: "These holdouts are probably spending their money in some other restaurant!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We need to find that 2% and reel 'em in."
Mr. Krabs says: "I need you two boys to get out there and promote the Krusty Krab!"
Squidward says: "Will we get overtime pay?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Over-what who?"
Squidward says: "Never."
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "I think I know just where to start!"

SpongeBob says: "Hello, Bottomites!"
SpongeBob says: "Hello, sir!"
SpongeBob says: "Have you ever heard of the most wonderful restaurant in all of Bikini Bottom, the Krusty Krab?"
Ted says: "Of course I have!"
Ted says: "That's where I'm going."
Ted says: "If you'll get out of my way."
SpongeBob says: "Please accept one of our fliers and consider dining at our fine dining establishment the next time you're feeling hungry."
Ted says: "But I'm hungry now!"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, sir!"
SpongeBob says: "Tell all your… friends."
SpongeBob says: "Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "Eat at the Krusty Krab!"
Patrick says: "Oh, no!"
Patrick says: "I knew this day would come!"
Patrick says: "Invasion of the Giant Patties!"
Patrick says: "There's only one thing to do!"
Patrick says: "It's eat or be eaten!"
Patrick runs up screaming and tries to eat SpongeBob.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing?"
SpongeBob says: "It's me, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Oh, no!"
Patrick says: "The giant patty has eaten my buddy!"
SpongeBob says: "Relax, Patrick!"

Patrick says: "You okay, little buddy?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, I'm doing really good, thanks I guess..."
Patrick says: "What's this?"
SpongeBob says: "It's a flyer..."
SpongeBob says: "to promote the Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "‘Cause Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs needs all the money!"

SpongeBob says: "Uh, Krusty Krab."
Patrick says: "Whatever."
SpongeBob says: "That tickles!"
Patrick says: "Hold still!"
Patrick says: "I'm almost through!"
Patrick says: "Perfect!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't forget the paint!"
Patrick says: "Hold on to your shorts!"
Patrick says: "I got it!"
SpongeBob says: "It's cold!"
Patrick says: "Okay, turn around!"
Patrick says: "Open your mouth!"
Patrick says: "Ready?"
SpongeBob says: "Ready!"
Patrick puts more advertisements on the walls of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob gives him a thumbs-up and the two leave, to which a police officer shows up.

Officer says: "That's disgraceful!"
Officer says: "I vow to bring the evil-doer to justice."
Officer says: "Right after I have a Krabby Patty at the Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what are we doing here?"
Patrick says: "I hired a skywriter!"
Patrick says: "Oh look, there he is now!"
A Skywriter falls from the sky and writes "Help Me!" on a clipboard.
Patrick says: "Somehow, I thought that would be more effective."

Pilar says: "I thought so."
SpongeBob says: "I think the ad campaign is going very well."

SpongeBob says: "Hello?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hi, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't know what you're doing, boy-o, but it's working like gang busterers."
Mr. Krabs says: "This place is as packed to the gills with gills!"
Mr. Krabs says: "In fact, I've seen at least half the holdouts, just since this morning!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
SpongeBob says: "I better get back to help with the crowd!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, don't worry, lad!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward's holdin' down the fort!"
