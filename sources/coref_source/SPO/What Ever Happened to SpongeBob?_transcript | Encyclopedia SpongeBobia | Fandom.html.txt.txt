Note says: "Line in red is cut in Indonesia."
Episode begins outside of SpongeBob's house at night. SpongeBob’s foghorn alarm goes off, making sheets fly off of SpongeBob's bed. His eye literally peel open.
SpongeBob says: "Good morning, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Mailman!"
Mailman says: "Morning, SpongeBob."
Mailman says: "Ah, it is a good morning, isn't it?"
SpongeBob says: "Isn't life great, Gary?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, what a beautiful day."
SpongeBob says: "I have the best friends..."
Cut to Squidward's bedroom.
Squidward says: "Oh, another SpongeBob nightmare."
Scene reverts to SpongeBob.
SpongeBob says: "The best job..."
Mr. Krabs says: "He's already ten seconds late!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm docking him a month's pay for this."
SpongeBob says: "And, of course, the bestest pet."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry!"
Patrick says: "Hi, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "How goes it?"
Patrick says: "Well, it was great until you showed up."
SpongeBob says: "What's that?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, that's the first time someone's called me that."
SpongeBob says: "Wait, I know who will enjoy my company."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Sandy says: "It's all done!"
Sandy says: "My greatest invention yet!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "What a neat robot!"
Sandy says: "Noooooooooo!"
SpongeBob says: "Let me explain."
SpongeBob says: "You see..."
SpongeBob says: "I was passing by the tree, and I thought it'd be funny if I gave you a surprise."
Sandy says: "Oh, you gave me a surprise, alright."
Sandy says: "Look at the surprise I got!"
SpongeBob says: "SpongeBob WorkPants reporting for duty, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hurry up and get in there, boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Patties need flipping."
SpongeBob says: "No worries, captain!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What the barnacles is going on?"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, are you okay?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm fine..."
Mr. Krabs says: "as long as me money's okay."
Outside the Krusty Krab the double doors swing open. SpongeBob lands across the street and Mr Krabs holds onto the double doors extremely enraged after kicking SpongeBob out.
Mr. Krabs says: "If I were you, I'd get as far away from me as possible, IDIOT BOY!"
SpongeBob says: "I somehow managed to make everyone mad at me."
SpongeBob says: "At least you still like me, right, Gare?"
We see Gary chewing on a bandage on his back. He hisses at SpongeBob.
Sandy says: "Patrick, where's SpongeBob?"
Patrick says: "I don't know."
Patrick says: "I've been knocking on his door for three hours."
Patrick says: "I need his hot sauce for my milkshake."
Sandy says: "We ain't got time for that."
Sandy says: "Hi-yah!"
Gary says: "Mrloooow."
Sandy says: "Gary?"
Sandy says: "Where are you, little guy?"
Gary says: "Mrloooow."
Sandy says: "Gary?"
Sandy says: "Gary?"
Gary says: "Mrloow."
Sandy says: "Gary!"
Sandy says: "What happened to you?"
Gary says: "Mrlooooooowrooowroowrooow."
Sandy says: "A note."
Harold says: "I could use this."
Jennifer-Millie says: "Yeah, I like these here."
Harold says: "This is top quality."
SpongeBob says: "Hello there."
SpongeBob says: "What's going on?"
Harold says: "Oh, we thought you were taking a dirt nap, but we organized your clothes for you..."
Harold says: "SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Are you talking to me?"
Harold says: "Isn't this your name?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know, is it?"
Harold says: "You don't know your name?"
SpongeBob says: "All I know is that I hit my head on some rocks!"
SpongeBob says: "Now I can't seem to remember anything."
Harold says: "Err, well, then I'll remind you that these are not your clothes, and your name isn't SpongeBob, it's, umm..."
Harold says: "it's..."
Harold says: "CheeseHead BrownPants."
Harold says: "Ha ha!"
Harold says: "That's it!"
Harold says: "Bubbles?!"
Harold says: "!"
The villagers scream and run away.
CheeseHead says: "I wonder what got into them?"
Perch Perkins says: "We interrupt this program for an important announcement."
Perch Perkins says: "We go now to news scene chopper 7."
Perch Perkins says: "What's up?"
News Chopper says: "Not looking too good out here, Perch."
News Chopper says: "The Krusty Krab is about to come apart of the hinges."
News Chopper says: "Customers are in a rage over not getting their Krabby Patties."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward, where the barnacles is SpongeBob?"
Mr. Krabs says: "This place is going down the toilet!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Patties need flipping!"
Squidward says: "If I knew, do you think I'd be standing here getting yelled at by a bunch of morons?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't talk back to your superior officer, you..."
Both start arguing. Sandy comes in.
Sandy says: "Squidward!"
Sandy says: "Mr."
Sandy says: "Krabs!"
Sandy says: "Y'all seen SpongeBob?"
Squidward says: "I think we just went through this..."
Mr. Krabs says: "What he means to say is, no, we haven't."
Sandy says: "Well, apparently, he's left Bikini Bottom, and he ain't coming back."
Mr. Krabs says: "Let me see that."
Mr. Krabs says: "It is SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What am I gonna do without me fry cook?"
Patrick says: "What am I gonna do without my best friend?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "I should never have been mean to you!"
Sandy says: "I should have never kicked you out of my house!"
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, group meeting."
Mr. Krabs says: "Everybody out!"
Mr. Krabs says: "The Krusty Krab's closed until further notice!"
Mr. Krabs says: "how do you propose we find me money-making employee?"
Cut to CheeseHead BrownPants in the streets of New Kelp City.
CheeseHead says: "Whoo, I live in a dump!"
Fish says: "Hey, watch where you're stepping!"
Fish says: "I know what you was doing, you was doing the old "bump into the sucker and reach into his pockets and take his change" routine!"
Fish says: "Well, it ain't gonna work this time!"
Fish says: "You want money?"
Fish says: "Get a job, you deadbeat."
CheeseHead says: "I'm a jobless deadbeat?"
CheeseHead says: "What a sad existence I don't remember I lead."
CheeseHead says: "Help wanted?"
Lisa says: "Well, Mr..."
Lisa says: "BrownPants..."
Lisa says: "you seem to have left this entire application blank."
CheeseHead says: "I can't remember a thing."
Lisa says: "Well, do you have any special skills?"
CheeseHead says: "Special skills..."
CheeseHead says: "oh, I can do this!"
CheeseHead says: "Okay, I guess they don't want you blowing bubbles, unless it directly relates to the job at hand."
CheeseHead says: "Thanks for the job, boss!"
CheeseHead says: "You won't be disappointed."
Builder says: "That's real sweet, BrownPants, but I don't hear that hammer pounding."
CheeseHead says: "Then this might be music to your ears."
CheeseHead says: "I do not understand this."
CheeseHead says: "What is wrong with this city?"
CheeseHead says: "Maybe it's not the city."
CheeseHead says: "Maybe it's me."
Sandy says: "Listen up, y'all!"
Sandy says: "I got a plan to bring back SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "You do?"
Sandy says: "Yup, and it involves this."
Sandy says: "It'll track any sponge within a 50-mile radius."
Squidward says: "So, you're saying this thing can actually find SpongeBob?"
Sandy says: "You got it, Squid Cakes, but it's gonna take all of us to find—"
Mr. Krabs says: "Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "This device was me last chance to get this place back into ship shape!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And since you destroyed it, I am ordering you to find SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "I wouldn't seek out that twit for all the leotards of the sea."
Mr. Krabs says: "If you don't find him, you'll be out of a job forever."
Squidward says: "Ha!"
Squidward says: "Is that your version of a threat?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, Squidward, don't forget your retirement gift."
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, I am not interested in any—"
Squidward says: "Is that a handcrafted, jewel-encrusted, ornamental egg?"
Squidward says: "That'll complete my collection!"
Squidward says: "Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Not so fast!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Bring back me number-one fry cook first."
Cut to CheeseHead, who is cold in the streets of New Kelp City. He goes to get warm near a barrel fire.
Fish says: "Real drag, isn't it?"
Fish says: "Having to stand around the fire for warmth every night?"
CheeseHead says: "Yeah."
Other Fish says: "Heh, not for us..."
Other Fish says: "we're just waiting in line for a new video game."
CheeseHead says: "I guess I am just a jobless deadbeat."
CheeseHead says: "You guys mind if I bubble?"
Fish says: "You can't do that here!"
CheeseHead says: "But..."
CheeseHead says: "bubbles will steady the ol' nerves."
CheeseHead says: "Watch."
CheeseHead says: "See?"
CheeseHead says: "Feeling better already."
Bubble Poppin' Boys Leader says: "Do you have any..."
Bubble Poppin' Boys Leader says: "As I was saying..."
Bubble Poppin' Boys Leader says: "do you have any idea who we are?"
CheeseHead says: "Um, wait..."
CheeseHead says: "err, um..."
CheeseHead says: "don't tell me, um..."
Bubble Poppin' Boys Leader says: "Don't answer."
Bubble Poppin' Boys Leader says: "Where'd he go?"
Bubble Poppin' Boys Leader says: "After him!"
CheeseHead tries to hide from the Bubble Poppin' Boys, but they surround him. He blows four bubbles to make a stairway. One of the Bubble Poppin' Boys climbs up a street light. He then blows a bubble raft and hops on it.
CheeseHead says: "Ah, I'll be making this getaway in comfort."
Man says: "You- you did it!"
Man says: "Do you realize what you've done?"
CheeseHead says: "No."
Man says: "You have freed the city."
Man says: "Citzens of New Kelp, come out of the shadows, 'cause CheeseBoy kicked the Bubble Poppin' gang right out of town!"
All says: "Thank you, CheeseBoy!"
Man #2 says: "What an amazing gift CheeseBoy has given us."
CheeseHead says: "Actually, it's CheeseHead."
Mayor says: "Well, CheeseHead, this is a historic day for New Kelp City."
Mayor says: "You have rid this city of the Bubble Poppin' Boys, and restored bubble-blowing to the streets."
Mayor says: "mayor of New Kelp City!"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "Maybe someone at that truck stop has seen our porous little buddy."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "There he is, guys!"
Patrick says: "Huh?"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Oh, I knew I'd find you, buddy!"
Patrick says: "Look at you."
Patrick says: "You haven't changed a bit."
Patrick says: "Let's go home and eat a gallon of seanut butter."
Sandy says: "That's not SpongeBob, Patrick."
Sandy says: "Uh, Pat?"
Sandy says: "All the ink came off on your belly."
Patrick says: "Oh."
Sandy says: "Now let's see what that little critter's up to."
Sandy says: "SpongeBob's mayor of New Kelp City!"
Mayor CheeseHead says: "Citizens of New Kelp City."
Mayor CheeseHead says: "I don't know much about politics or balanced budgets or how to be a "leader"."
Mayor CheeseHead says: "I'm not exactly sure what a "mayor…is."
Mayor CheeseHead says: "" But I do know this, while I am wearing the mayor's hat, it will always be safe to blow bubbles on the streets of New Kelp or my name isn't CheeseHead BrownPants."
Sandy says: "CheeseHead BrownPants?"
Man #3 says: "New Kelp City has brown-pants mania."
Sandy says: "Hang on a minute."
Sandy says: "I don't mean to put a damper on the mood here, but Bikini Bottom needs you back, SpongeBob."
Mayor CheeseHead says: "What's that?"
Sandy says: "Well, I'm sorry I yelled at you, buddy."
Mayor CheeseHead says: "Oh, this is a surprise."
Sandy says: "Surprised I found you?"
Mayor CheeseHead says: "No, surprised at seeing a talking weasel."
Sandy says: "It's me, Sandy."
Sandy says: "Don't pretend you don't remember me, SpongeBob."
Mayor CheeseHead says: "Sorry, Sandy."
Mayor CheeseHead says: "But I'd probably remember another underwater, talking weasel."
Patrick says: "You may not remember the weasel, but you haven't forgotten your best friend, have you?"
Mayor CheeseHead says: "I have no idea how that got there."
Mayor CheeseHead says: "All I remember is hitting my head, blowing some bubbles and now, poof, I'm mayor."
Sandy says: "You must've lost your memory when you hit your head."
Sandy says: "You'll just have to come back with us to Bikini Bottom."
Sandy says: "The familiar surroundings will bring your memory right back."
Mayor CheeseHead says: "Uh, sorry, weasel girl, I can't leave."
Mayor CheeseHead says: "These people need my leadership."
Mayor CheeseHead says: "In fact, I'm late for a meeting."
Squidward says: "Don't just stand there, get in."
Sandy says: "Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Hurry up!"
Sandy says: "Here it is!"
Sandy says: "You must recognize this place."
Mayor CheeseHead says: "Nope."
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't recognize the Krusty Krab?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Stop your kidding, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "And start frying up them patties."
Mayor CheeseHead says: "I was a fry cook before?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Aye, the best in the business."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now get flipping."
Mayor CheeseHead says: "Look, guys, as much as I'd love to toil the days away flipping burgers, I think I'll just go back to my modest job as mayor of a major city."
Squidward says: "Whoo-hoo-hoo, SpongeBob's leaving for real this time!"
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, I brought back your number one fry cook."
Squidward says: "You gotta pay up."
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward, a deal's a deal."
Mr. Krabs says: "Here's your fancy egg."
Squidward says: "Ohh!"
Squidward says: "It's Beau-ti-ful!"
Sandy says: "You okay, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, just a bit of a headache, Sandy-  Hey, I remember this place!"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob's back!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We're really sorry we ran you out of town, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "But we're glad you're back."
SpongeBob says: "I'd really love to stay, but the people of New Kelp City need their mayor."
SpongeBob says: "Goodbye, everyone."
Sandy says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
Patrick says: "What?"
Sandy says: "/ Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "/ Huh?"
Patrick says: "/ Huh?"
Sandy says: "/ Oh, not again."
Mr. Krabs says: "/ Oh, not again."
Patrick says: "/ Oh, not again."
Squidward says: "He's leaving, again!"
Perch Perkins says: "Stop what you're doing and don't go out that door."
Construction Fish says: "If I ever see Mayor BrownPants again, I'm gonna grab his little, yellow head and literally rip his!"
Construction Fish says: "—"
Mr. Krabs says: "Where's SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob is in the Krusty Krab kitchen.
SpongeBob says: "Who wants to be a dumb old mayor when you're the best fry cook in town?"
SpongeBob says: "And how could I ever leave behind my bestest friends?"
Patrick says: "Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, Krabby Patty!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, another masterpiece."
Sandy says: "It's great to have you back, Spongy."
SpongeBob says: "Looks like I'm back in Bikini Bottom forever."
In the background cows are mooing. Squidward opens his head, removes his brain, and throws it in the trash can.
