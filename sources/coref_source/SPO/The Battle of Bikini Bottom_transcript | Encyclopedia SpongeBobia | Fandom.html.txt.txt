The episode starts at the Bikini Bottom Mall, where SpongeBob and Patrick are trying on shirts.
Patrick says: "Where's your best friend now, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, according to this T shirt, it says my best friend is right here."
Patrick says: "How about now?"
SpongeBob says: "Let's get them, Patrick."
Shubie says: "Can I help you boys?"
SpongeBob says: "I believe you can."
SpongeBob says: "My best friend and I would like to purchase..."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, why are you crying?"
Patrick says: "You..."
Patrick says: "found a new best friend."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, what are you..."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, look out, behind you!!"
Nazz says: "Excuse me, but does this come in..."
Patrick says: "Noooo!"
Patrick says: "You're not my best friend!"
SpongeBob says: "Weâ€™ve gotta ditch these outfits!"
SpongeBob says: "They're sending out the wrong signals!"
SpongeBob says: "We need new outfits to show our best friendiness, Pat."
Patrick says: "You mean like those guys?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, just like those guys."
SpongeBob says: "Best friend outfits like these really make a statement."
Patrick says: "Look at these guys!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "I like that one."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, mister, where did you and your friends get your matching outfits?"
Bill says: "Oh, no, these aren't my friends."
Bill says: "In fact, I hate just about everyone here, but my love for historical battles is so great, I join these losers every year to re-enact the battle of Bikini Bottom."
SpongeBob says: "There was a battle of Bikini Bottom?"
Patrick says: "Well, duh, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "It's only the most significant event in Bikini Bottom history!"
Nathiel Waters says: "Clean as a whistle!"
Patrick says: "And those who had more important things to do with their time."
Colonial Patrick says: "That looks good to me."
Nathiel says: "That is truly disgusting!"
Colonial Patrick says: "Oh, yeah?"
Nathiel says: "You can't go around our town touching things with those filthy mitts!"
Colonial Patrick says: "Oh, yeah?!"
Colonial Patrick says: "!"
Nathiel says: "Yes!"
Red Group says: "Wash your hands!"
Blue Group says: "Never!"
Patrick says: "And that's how we won our right to wash as we please."
SpongeBob says: "You don't wash your hands, Patrick?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "Never have, never will."
SpongeBob says: "Echhh!"
Patrick says: "Does that bother you, huh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "That's okay."
SpongeBob says: "Thank you, friend."
SpongeBob says: "So, anyway, I said..."
Patrick says: "Oh, wait."
Patrick says: "You've got something on your tongue."
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
Patrick says: "Here, I'll get it."
SpongeBob says: "Thank you."
SpongeBob says: "Frankly, yes, Patrick, that does bother me."
Patrick says: "Well, then I guess we can't be friends."
SpongeBob says: "What are you saying?"
Patrick says: "Ugh, do I have to spell it out for you?"
Patrick says: "U..."
Patrick says: "R..."
Patrick says: "huh..."
Patrick says: "How do you spell "not my friend"?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, come on, we can work this out."
SpongeBob says: "We'll start a new life, just you, me, and this can of disinfectant spray."
Patrick says: "No, thank you."
Patrick says: "I happen to like my various smells and germs."
SpongeBob says: "But being clean is so much better."
Patrick says: "Well, says you."
Patrick says: "I like dirty."
SpongeBob says: "Clean!"
Patrick says: "Dirty!"
SpongeBob says: "Clean!"
Harold says: "Excuse us, but we have a battle to re-enact."
SpongeBob says: "Fine, if that's how it is, then  I am joining the other side!"
Patrick says: "Fine, me too!"
Harold says: "Ah, come on!"
Harold says: "Let's go play somewhere else."
SpongeBob says: "Ha!"
SpongeBob says: "Got your nose!"
Patrick says: "Hey, give it back!"
SpongeBob says: "Not until you wash your hands!"
Patrick says: "Oh, yeah?"
SpongeBob says: "Eww, brain juice!"
Patrick says: "Do you give up yet?"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Patrick , but a filthy slob like you is no match for a clean-cut fellow like me."
Patrick says: "Your pants are falling down."
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
Patrick says: "I'll fix it."
SpongeBob says: "Satisfied?"
Patrick says: "There, you look good now."
SpongeBob says: "You could use a makeover, though."
SpongeBob says: "Ugh, look at those feet."
Patrick says: "Why, what's wrong with them?"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, I'll take care of it."
Patrick says: "No!"
Patrick says: "Not a pedicure!"
Patrick says: "You sick little monster, face my morning breath!"
Patrick inhales deeply and then exhales his foul breath, making SpongeBob break.
SpongeBob says: "You, sir, could use some dental hygiene!"
Patrick says: "Who, me?"
Patrick says: "My teeth are fine, see?"
SpongeBob says: "A little toothpaste, and you'll have teeth like mine."
SpongeBob says: "You're a stinky, stinky sea star."
SpongeBob says: "I think you could use a shot of..."
SpongeBob says: "this!"
Patrick says: "No!"
Patrick says: "No, not..."
Patrick says: "not deodorant!"
Patrick says: "It's booger time!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, booger, schmooger, you don't even have a nose."
Patrick says: "Oh, yeah?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Gold?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Heehee!"
Squidward says: "Did you get any of Patrick's "gold"?"
Mr. Krabs says: "He's not digging for any gold I'm looking for."
Patrick says: "Ha!"
Patrick says: "I got you now!"
Patrick says: "See this?"
SpongeBob says: "A Krabby Patty?"
SpongeBob says: "What are you going to do, eat it?"
Patrick says: "Oh, I'm not going to eat it."
SpongeBob says: "No, not patty socks!"
SpongeBob says: "You better stop that!"
Patrick says: "Hopping..."
Patrick says: "Hey, I got my filth back!"
SpongeBob says: "Not for long, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Sticky-Shorts!"
SpongeBob says: "You won't have your filth once I use this on you!"
Patrick says: "No, not soap!"
Patrick says: "You wouldn't dare!"
SpongeBob says: "Try me!"
Patrick says: "Stay back, I'll do it!"
SpongeBob says: "It's too late for that!"
Patrick says: "My beautiful filth!"
Patrick says: "It's gone!"
Patrick says: "I'm squeaky clean!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm covered in muck and scum!"
Patrick says: "Man, to get my filth back, I'll have to wallow in mud forever!"
SpongeBob says: "It'll take weeks for me to get clean."
SpongeBob says: "I'll need twenty baths a day!"
Patrick says: "Slather toe jam on my armpits?"
SpongeBob says: "I'll have to disinfect my eyeballs!"
Patrick says: "Smear slime on my teeth?"
SpongeBob says: "And dry-clean my uvula!"
They think for a minute and after we hear a bell dinging, they giggle happily.
Both says: "All right!"
SpongeBob says: "Now that I'm filthy, I can spend all day getting clean."
Patrick says: "And since I'm clean, I can get even filthier!"
Patrick says: "Thanks, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick, thank you."
Both says: "You're my best friend ever!"
Bill says: "Hey, what's going on here?"
Bill says: "This battle isn't over until we have a winner."
SpongeBob says: "Fret not, my friend, for I have learned the truth."
SpongeBob says: "It matters not whether one is dirty or clean, for can cleanliness exist without filthiness, and would we know filthiness without cleanliness?"
SpongeBob says: "We must not re-enact the history that divides us, rather we must embrace that which draws us together."
SpongeBob says: "All must be free to choose their own path."
SpongeBob says: "Right, friend Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Squeaky clean, squeaky, it's squeaky."
SpongeBob says: "Mm-hmm, he has embraced the truth."
Bill says: "Wow!"
Bill says: "I think the little yellow guy has taught us a valuable lesson."
SpongeBob says: "And what is that, my son?"
Bill says: "That re-enacting battles is really lame!"
Bill says: "Come on, guys, let's play something more manly, like football!"
Harold says: "Or hockey!"
Thaddeus says: "Or knitting fluffy sweaters!"
All pause, and then run off, cheering.
SpongeBob says: "Come, Patrick, my work here is done."
