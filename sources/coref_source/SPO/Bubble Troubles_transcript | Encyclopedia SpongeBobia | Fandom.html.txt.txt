SpongeBob says: "You want more?"
SpongeBob says: "Let's go to Sandy's."
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, Sandy, check out these new spicy bubbles that Patrick invented."
Patrick says: "Yeah, I thinked it up with my own head."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe even smarter."
Sandy says: "Smarter, huh?"
Sandy says: "Well, I'd love to try out your new-fangled bubbles, Patrick, but I've got to fix these air lines to my treedome."
Sandy says: "They're all clogged up and the lack of fresh air is making me woozy."
Patrick says: "Why don't you just breathe water like a smart person?"
Patrick says: "Guess you're just too dumb."
SpongeBob says: "I know, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "I'll use these spicy bubbles."
SpongeBob says: "They'll clean out your pipes for you."
Sandy says: "That's sweet of you, SpongeBob, but a bunch of little old bubbles ain't gonna clear these air lines."
SpongeBob says: "Oops."
Sandy says: "I'll tar and feather you nincompoops later."
Sandy says: "My suit's air supply is nearing empty."
Sandy says: "Luckily, I have just enough air in my submarine to get to the surface and refill my air tanks."
SpongeBob says: "Phew!"
SpongeBob says: "Thank goodness."
SpongeBob says: "Allow me to get the door."
Patrick says: "Even I knew that was dumb."
Sandy says: "Oh, no!"
Sandy says: "I have only a few minutes of air left!"
Sandy says: "I'm far too dizzy already."
Sandy says: "You'll have to drive, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Whoo!"
SpongeBob says: "How's Sandy doing back there?"
Patrick says: "I'm not sure."
Patrick says: "Let me check."
Patrick says: "Oh!"
Sandy says: "Hey there, Patty-Pat-Pat-Pat-Patrick."
Sandy says: "Careful where you're breathing."
Sandy says: "You don't want to disturb the subatomic particle rodeo."
Sandy says: "Yee-haw, micro-dawgies!"
Sandy says: "Rope them molecules."
Patrick says: "She's totally losing it."
Sandy says: "Are there cobwebs on my face?"
Sandy says: "'Cause it feels like there's cobwebs on my face."
Patrick says: "Never mind."
Patrick says: "She seems fine."
SpongeBob says: "Hold on just a little longer, Sandy, we're almost there."
SpongeBob says: "I can see sunlight.."
Sandy says: "Gimme that wheel, SquareButt."
Sandy says: "I know a shortcut."
SpongeBob says: "Make sure and hold her tight, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Don't worry."
Patrick says: "She's not going anywhere."
Sandy says: "Ahh..."
SpongeBob says: "Blah!"
SpongeBob says: "Fresh air."
SpongeBob says: "Let's hurry up and get this over with."
Patrick says: "Get what over with?"
Patrick says: "I thought she was with you."
SpongeBob says: "Uh-oh."
Sandy says: "Hang on, fellers!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, what are you doing?"
SpongeBob says: "Air is up there."
Sandy says: "Yeah, yeah."
Sandy says: "Right after I grab a quick bit at the Krusty Krab."
Sandy says: "Yee-haw."
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Patrick says: "No!"
Sandy says: "Oh, well, I guess I won't be needing this anymore."
SpongeBob says: "No Sandy, you need air, not food!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's going on out here?"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, Sandy's run out of that crazy air stuff that she needs to breathe."
SpongeBob says: "We have to find some right now or she'll be headed for the last roundup."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, okay."
Mr. Krabs says: "I suppose I can't have her croaking at the Krusty Krab."
Mr. Krabs says: "That'd be bad for business."
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, let's see here."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hmm..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oxygen."
Mr. Krabs says: "O2 I believe."
Mr. Krabs says: "Good old atomic number eight."
Patrick says: "Uh--uh--  Hey, everyone."
Patrick says: "Look!"
Patrick says: "There's some air bubbles trapped on the ceiling."
Mr. Krabs says: "But how are you gonna get them down?"
SpongeBob says: "Never fear."
SpongeBob says: "I know what to do."
SpongeBob says: "We can use these straws to suck the bubbles down."
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait a minute."
Mr. Krabs says: "Those straws cost me money!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, don't worry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I'll put them all back."
Patrick says: "Hurry up, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "I'm no doctor, but I don't think squirrels are suppose to be blue."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, I'm ready."
Patrick says: "Just a little bit further."
Patrick says: "Okay, got it."
SpongeBob says: "Hurry up, Patrick."
Sandy says: "Hm-mmm."
Patrick says: "Looks like her color's coming back."
SpongeBob says: "That's good, but is it gonna be good enough?"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, you must have some spare Squidward always says you're full of hot air."
Squidward says: "I said what?"
Mr. Krabs says: "So you think I'm full of hot air, do ye?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, in this case, you're right."
Mr. Krabs says: "There's usually an air bubble or two trapped inside me shell."
Pearl says: "Daddy, there's a submarine on the roof."
Pearl says: "Oh, you seem kind of busy."
Pearl says: "Maybe I should come back later."
SpongeBob says: "No, Pearl."
SpongeBob says: "Don't go."
SpongeBob says: "You're a mammal, right?"
Pearl says: "Yeah, I guess so."
SpongeBob says: "And you breathe air, right?"
Pearl says: "Sure, my nose is full of it."
SpongeBob says: "You've got to help Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "She needs to share your air."
Pearl says: "I guess us mammals have to stick together."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, hold still."
SpongeBob says: "This may pinch a little  When I tug on this rope, you pull me down."
Patrick says: "But how are you going to get up there?"
SpongeBob says: "I'll use this tank of oxygen as a makeshift rocket."
Patrick says: "An oxygen tank!"
Patrick says: "Great idea, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "I know."
SpongeBob says: "Wish me luck, old friend."
Patrick says: "SquarePants, I salute you."
Patrick says: "Hey, who did that?"
Patrick says: "Hey!"
Patrick says: "Oh!"
Patrick says: "Ghost!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, here we go."
Patrick says: "Ah, ah!"
Patrick says: "Oof!"
SpongeBob says: "Welcome back, Sandy."
Sandy says: "I'm alive?"
Sandy says: "And the treedome's full of air?"
Sandy says: "And sort of dry?"
Sandy says: "How'd you fellers pull it off?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, you could say we had a little help from a big bubble."
Sandy says: "Hmm..."
Sandy says: "In case you forgot, it was bubbles that got us into this mess in the first place."
Sandy says: "I don't want you blowing anymore bubbles around my house."
SpongeBob says: "Uh-oh."
Patrick says: "Uh-oh."
