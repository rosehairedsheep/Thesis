SpongeBob is talking out the trash at the back of the Krusty Krab. He grunts and tosses it in the dumpster.
Plankton says: "Hahaha!"
Plankton says: "You failed!"
Plankton says: "I've finally stolen a Krabby Patty!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's nice."
Plankton says: "Aren't you gonna try and take it back from me?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, goodness no."
Mr. Krabs says: "You go ahead."
Mr. Krabs says: "Take it."
SpongeBob says: "But, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, Plankton will figure out the Krabby Patty formula."
Mr. Krabs says: "Run along little fella."
Mr. Krabs says: "Enjoy your Krabby Patty."
Plankton says: "Wow, you must've snapped Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, just a little security measure I've been working on."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now all Krabby Patties self-destruct 10 feet beyond the Krusty Krab!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Sucker!"
Sandals says: "Those Krabby Patties really hit the spot."
Abigail Marge says: "And next time you might wanna try chewing 'em."
Abigail Marge says: "You're gonna blow up like a balloon."
Sandals says: "Haha, nonse—"
Abigail Marge says: "He never listens to me."
Plankton says: "Aw, man!"
Plankton says: "I stole the Krabby Patty fair and square!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, poor wittle baby waby."
Mr. Krabs says: "Does wittle Pwanksy wanksy need his nappy wappy?"
SpongeBob says: "Why are you two always fighting?"
SpongeBob says: "You were best palsie-walsies once."
Plankton says: "Hey!"
SpongeBob says: "Can't you two make up and be friends?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, those day are over, SpongeBob."
Plankton says: "Ooh..."
Plankton says: "Krabs and I are bitter enemies!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And that's the way we like it!"
SpongeBob says: "If only there was some way to bring you two back together."
Plankton says: "Forget it, SpongeBob."
Plankton says: "Nothin' will make me friend with Eugene Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Bluh!"
SpongeBob says: "That doesn't smell delicious!"
Plankton says: "No, not that."
Plankton says: "It's coming from this way."
Plankton says: "Must know more!"
SpongeBob says: "The Flabby Patty?"
Plankton says: "Another restaurant."
Plankton says: "Looks like Krabs has some real competition, huh.."
Plankton says: "?"
Plankton says: "Interesting."
Harold says: "Wow, a Flabby Patty."
Plankton's eye turn to numbers counting down and his antennae start burning away.
Countdown Voice says: "T minus 3, 2, 1."
Countdown Voice says: "Liftoff."
Plankton shoots up like a rocket and lands on SpongeBob's nose.
Plankton says: "That was fantastic!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I have great news!"
Mr. Krabs says: "The bank is handing out free samples of money?"
SpongeBob says: "Nooo."
SpongeBob says: "There's a new restaurant down the street called the Flabby Patty, and now Plankton only wants to steal their recipe."
SpongeBob says: "Isn't that wonderful?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What!"
Mr. Krabs says: "?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Some imitation patty is tryin' to steal me business?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, but me customers are loyal."
Mr. Krabs says: "The Flabby Patty shack has stolen all me customers!"
Plankton says: "Get used to it, Krabs."
Plankton says: "Your Krabby Patty is old news."
Plankton says: "Once I steal the Flabby Patty recipe your customers will be eating at the Chum Bucket!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, no they won't, because I'll steal the Flabby Patty recipe first!"
Plankton says: "Hey, stealin' recipes it my shtick."
Plankton says: "You haven't got a chance against me."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ha!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I bet I get that recipe way before you."
Plankton says: "Bet ya don't!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Bet I will!"
Plankton says: "Won't!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Will!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa now."
SpongeBob says: "Instead of competing, why don't you cooperate and steal the recipe together?"
Mr. Krabs and Plankton stare at SpongeBob for a second and then both start laughing.
Plankton says: "You're a loser, Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Dig, SpongeBob, dig!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm digging, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I'm digging."
Plankton says: "What the..."
Plankton says: "!"
Plankton says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I think we're here."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ha!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Recipe thievin' is as easy as pie."
Plankton is falling and screaming still.
Mr. Krabs says: "Where are you hiding?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ooh, there you are my sweetie."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Grandma."
Plankton pops out from Mr. Krabs' eye.
Plankton says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
Plankton says: "Ow!"
Plankton says: "Ow!"
Plankton says: "Ow!"
Plankton says: "Ow!"
Plankton says: "Ow!"
Plankton says: "Owuhhh."
SpongeBob says: "Don't you see?"
SpongeBob says: "If you work together, the Flabby Patty recipe would be yours."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll never work with that melignorant microbe."
Plankton says: "Look what that skin flint did to my antennae."
Mr. Krabs says: "I've heard all I'm gonna hear from the likes of you."
Plankton says: "You'll be hearin' from my lawyer is what you'll be hearin'!"
SpongeBob sighs.
Plankton says: "Stand aside, restaurant critic coming through!"
Fred says: "So?"
Plankton says: "I'm a restaurant critic, so I get cutsies."
Fred says: "Cutsies?"
Fred says: "What's a cutsie?"
Plankton says: "What is this world coming to when a fake restaurant critic can't get cutsies?"
Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob pop out from behind the fish. He looks at them.
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, so here's the plan."
Mr. Krabs says: "I want you to—"
Mr. Krabs says: "Waitin' in line here."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's all."
Fred says: "Yeah, that's amazing."
SpongeBob says: "Hello?"
SpongeBob says: "I—"
SpongeBob says: "I have an announcement to make!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ooh, an announcement."
Mr. Krabs says: "We should listen."
Mr. Krabs says: "It might save your lives."
SpongeBob says: "The fish hooks are coming!"
Everyone screams.
Mr. Krabs says: "Brilliant work, laddie."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, how come you're not trampled?"
All says: "Fish hooks!"
Plankton drags himself in the sand towards SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs, grunting with ever pull. He then stands up and uses his antennae as a crank to push the sand out of his mouth.
Mr. Krabs says: "Looks like you blew it again, Plankton."
Plankton says: "I did better than you, Eugene!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Says who?"
SpongeBob says: "Now, now, I think we all need to calm down."
SpongeBob says: "Fighting is pointless."
SpongeBob says: "You two would have the recipe by now if you only worked together."
Mr. Krabs says: "We'll work together."
Plankton says: "Yeah, I don't see that workin' out."
SpongeBob says: "Not to worry gentlemen."
SpongeBob says: "I have a plan."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah, perfect."
Mr. Krabs says: "We look ridiculous."
Mr. Krabs says: "Nobody's gonna buy this disguise."
SpongeBob says: "See?"
SpongeBob says: "You guys are agreeing already."
SpongeBob says: "That's the first step to cooperation."
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, what's your stupid plan anyway?"
SpongeBob says: "Look over there."
Plankton grunts and turns Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs says: "Little more."
Mr. Krabs says: "Little more."
SpongeBob says: "The Flabby Patty is hiring."
SpongeBob says: "If you can get the job, the recipe is yours."
Plankton says: "Why am I on the bottom?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Stop whining!"
Chef says: "Yes?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hello, I'm here to steal—"
Mr. Krabs says: "no—"
Mr. Krabs says: "darn..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I mean, apply for a job."
Chef says: "You're hired."
Chef says: "Your first assignment, memorize this recipe."
Chef says: "Well, I'm going on break."
Chef says: "Keep and eye on the place."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes!"
Mr. Krabs says: "The recipe is mine!"
Plankton says: "Not so fast, Krabs!"
Plankton says: "Hahahaha!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ah!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Give it here!"
Both are trying to pull the recipe away.
Plankton says: "Oh, no you don't!"
Both grunting.
Both says: "Nooo!"
Plankton says: "Yeah, you like that!"
Both on ground fighting for the recipe and mumbling at each other.
Mr. Krabs says: "The recipe—"
Mr. Krabs says: "We did it."
Plankton says: "We co-op-er-a-ted."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, let's see what's the flabby that's in this patty."
Both says: "Four pounds grade A love."
Plankton says: "One tablespoon listening."
Plankton says: "Two tablespoons..."
Plankton says: "understanding?"
Plankton says: "Mix ingredients thoroughly."
Plankton says: "Fold in warm heart."
Plankton says: "Sounds like a recipe for cannibalism."
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait a minute, this isn't a recipe for patties."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's a recipe for friendship."
Chef walks up to Mr. Krabs and Plankton.
Chef says: "You see boys, this recipe is no secret, but I do have a surprise."
SpongeBob pulls off Chef costume.
SpongeBob says: "Ta-da!"
SpongeBob says: "I started the Flabby Patty restaurant just to get you two rascals to team up."
SpongeBob says: "And so the power of friendship triumphs again."
Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You mean all this was one of your goofball schemes?"
Plankton says: "Now, now, Krabs, SpongeBob has taught us important life lessons, such as, oh, how to fall out of an airplane for instance."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, and how to comically bludgeon meself."
Plankton says: "In fact, I think it's time we repay him, don't you?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Great idea, pal."
Plankton says: "We should do this more often, Krabs."
