An envelope is pushed through SpongeBob's door.
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Thank you, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Postman."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "Cousin BlackJack's out of prison?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Gary says: "Meow?"
SpongeBob says: "That's right, Gary, the cousin BlackJack!"
SpongeBob says: "The same cousin BlackJack that used to beat me up all the time when we were kids!"
Young BlackJack says: "Come on, little man!"
Young BlackJack says: "Let's go a couple of rounds, if you think you're tough."
Young SpongeBob says: "Why should we?"
Young BlackJack says: "Because it'll show what a little man you are."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, no."
SpongeBob says: "That was years ago, Gary!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "My sentiments exactly."
SpongeBob says: "Just imagine what he must look like now!"
BlackJack says: "Hi, SpongeBob."
BlackJack says: "It's been a while."
BlackJack says: "Good to see that you're still a little man."
SpongeBob says: "That brute has my parents!"
SpongeBob says: "I got to get over there!"
SpongeBob says: "Gary, I don't know how long I'll be gone."
SpongeBob says: "I don't know if I'll ever come back."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "I may get beaten to a quivering pulp but I must do it, for the sake of my parents!"
Mrs. SquarePants says: "Oh, darling, it's so nice to spend quality time with you; what with you in the office all hours of the day."
BlackJack says: "I got a new outfit for ya!"
SpongeBob says: "That fiend!"
SpongeBob says: "Where did he take them?"
SpongeBob says: "I must find more evidence."
SpongeBob says: "What's this?"
SpongeBob says: "Another note."
Grandma says: "SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Grandma?"
SpongeBob says: "Are you talking to me from beyond the beyond?"
Grandma says: "Well, if you mean from beyond the kitchen table, yes."
Grandma says: "You're just in time."
Grandma says: "I've baked a fresh batch of gingerbread men."
SpongeBob says: "But where's BlackJack?"
Grandma says: "Oh, BlackJack just called and left a message for you."
Grandma says: "He couldn't make it because he's got some loose ends to tie up."
SpongeBob says: "Loose ends."
SpongeBob says: "My parents!"
SpongeBob says: "He's tied them up?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Grandma says: "And if you don't hurry, you'll miss out on all the fun."
Grandma says: "And when it's all done, he'll need help cleaning up the mess."
SpongeBob says: "Cleaning up the mess?"
SpongeBob says: "Uncle Captain Blue, I need your help!"
Uncle Captain Blue says: "Well, if it isn't little SpongeBob."
Uncle Captain Blue says: "Plant a firm one on me, Bobby."
SpongeBob says: "I need you to help me rescue my parents!"
Uncle Captain Blue says: "Sure, Little Bobby."
Uncle Captain Blue says: "I could use some help with the lawn, but you're gonna need this to do the job right."
Narrator says: "346 minutes later..."
SpongeBob says: "Uncle Captain Blue, I need to help my parents!"
SpongeBob says: "They're in danger!"
Uncle Captain Blue says: "The boy came to work."
SpongeBob says: "Actually, I came to try to find my..."
Uncle Captain Blue says: "Copy?"
Uncle Captain Blue says: "Do you copy?"
SpongeBob says: "Uncle Captain Blue, Uncle Captain Blue!"
SpongeBob says: "Please help me!"
Uncle Captain Blue says: "Well, of course you can!"
Narrator says: "Much, much, much later..."
SpongeBob says: "I AM DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR MY MOMMY AND DADDY!"
Uncle Captain Blue says: "Landscaping?"
Uncle Captain Blue says: "Isn't it a little dark out for landscaping?"
SpongeBob says: "Listen, Uncle Captain Blue!"
SpongeBob says: "We don't have much time."
SpongeBob says: "Cousin BlackJack has my parents held captive at his house!"
Uncle Captain Blue says: "They let that dangerous miscreant out of prison?"
Uncle Captain Blue says: "Sounds like your parents are in trouble, kid."
SpongeBob says: "That's why we have to rescue them now!"
Uncle Captain Blue says: "Whoa, there, Little Bobby."
Uncle Captain Blue says: "No can do."
SpongeBob says: "But, Uncle Captain Blue, I need the help of a crime fighter like you!"
Uncle Captain Blue says: "No, no, I don't chase criminals these days."
Uncle Captain Blue says: "I'm retired, and if I were you, I'd consider turning around and going home."
Uncle Captain Blue says: "You're not cut out for this kind of work, boy."
Uncle Captain Blue says: "An innocent kid like you doesn't stand a chance against a criminal mind."
Uncle Captain Blue says: "Do you have any idea what people like that do to people like you?"
SpongeBob says: "You mean they won't give me a push on the swing set?"
Uncle Captain Blue says: "Well, let's just say, I hope you've practiced walking without legs, or arms, or a body."
Uncle Captain Blue says: "But since you insist, I'll drive you all the way over to BlackJack's right now."
SpongeBob says: "Nice wormy, nice wormy."
SpongeBob says: "Nice wormy."
Uncle Captain Blue says: "Do you have any idea what people like that do to people like you?"
SpongeBob says: "Uncle Captain Blue is right."
SpongeBob says: "I'm not cut out for this."
SpongeBob says: "I should just turn around and go home."
SpongeBob says: "Mom?"
Margaret says: "Help me!"
SpongeBob says: "They're trapped in the basement!"
SpongeBob says: "Mom, dad, quick!"
SpongeBob says: "Let's get out of here!"
Margaret says: "Oh, but if we leave now, we'll miss the party."
SpongeBob says: "Party?"
Margaret says: "Oh, why, yes."
Margaret says: "We're celebrating your cousin BlackJack's release from prison."
Harold says: "Now if your klutzy mother can stop dropping her punch glass like she dropped that picture frame..."
Margaret says: "I told you, Harold, that was the fumigators' fault."
SpongeBob says: "The fumigators?"
SpongeBob says: "So that wasn't a crime scene I saw at your house?"
Harold says: "The only crime that ever happened at our house was the infestation of those worthless krill, but they should be gone by now."
SpongeBob says: "So, you two aren't being tortured by cousin BlackJack?"
Harold says: "No, SpongeBob, your cousin BlackJack has paid his debt to society and renounced his criminal ways."
Harold says: "Never again will he litter."
BlackJack says: "That's right, little man!"
Margaret says: "Oh, well here comes the man of the hour."
Margaret says: "He's been talking all day about playing with his little cousin again."
Margaret says: "He mentioned something about jumping rope with like the old days."
BlackJack says: "Did you come here to quiver like a jellyfish, or did you come to wrestle?"
BlackJack says: "I always knew you were a little man."
BlackJack says: "Prepare to live your past in the present."
SpongeBob says: "Cousin BlackJack?"
BlackJack says: "In the living flesh!"
SpongeBob says: "That tickles!"
BlackJack says: "Just like the old days, eh, cousin?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, BlackJack, you haven't changed a bit."
