The episode opens at the Krusty Krab. In his office, Mr. Krabs is sitting at his desk with an adding machine, singing.
Mr. Krabs says: "â™ª Counting me money, money sweeter than honey, money, money, this, money, money, that, profit will make me wallet fat!"
His eyes bug out at the ticker tape.
Mr. Krabs says: "What?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Profits down three dollars from last month!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I got to start running a tighter ship around here!"
Meanwhile, Squidward is helping Martha in his ordering boat at the dining area of the Krusty Krab.
Squidward says: "Thank you for choosing the Krusty Krab."
Squidward says: "Here's your change."
Gives Martha a dollar, and she walks off. Mr. Krabs approaches him.
Mr. Krabs says: "Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Squidward says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's with all this "change" nonsense?"
SpongeBob walks over, knotting his tie.
SpongeBob says: "Over and under, grab the end, put it through here, up and around, round the horn, bring it back home."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hmm?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I ain't paying you to play dress up!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Breathe on your own time."
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't pay you to breathe."
Squidward says: "You hardly pay us at all."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, that reminds me."
Mr. Krabs says: "I got something for you."
He hands his employees envelopes.
Squidward says: "Ah, yes!"
Squidward says: "Our meager restitution."
Squidward says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, sorry, that's me dry cleaning."
Mr. Krabs says: "Here's your check."
He gives SpongeBob an envelope as well.
Mr. Krabs says: "And here's yours, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "I can't accept your money, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Grilling is my passion."
Squidward says: "What is this!"
Squidward says: "?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "You're making me pay you to stand at the cash register?"
Squidward says: "What is the meaning of this?"
Squidward says: "Have you gone off the deep end?"
Mr. Krabs says: "There's going to be a few changes around here."
Mr. Krabs says: "Every time I catch you two goofing off, I'm gonna charge you for it."
SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs, preparing money for him.
SpongeBob says: "18..."
SpongeBob says: "19..."
SpongeBob says: "and..."
SpongeBob says: "20."
SpongeBob says: "Here you go, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "K."
SpongeBob says: "I think this should cover all my nonsense."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, and here's an extra fifty cents for when I was tying my shoe."
Squidward says: "Uh, SpongeBob?"
Squidward says: "What do you think you're doing?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm just giving Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs the money I owe him."
Squidward says: "Well, I'm not paying that cheapskate Krabs one cent, and I suggest you do the same."
SpongeBob says: "Why?"
Squidward says: "We've got to unite as workers and demand the respect we deserve from the boss!"
Squidward says: "In fact, you and I should go on strike!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "You and me go on strike?"
Squidward says: "Sure!"
Squidward says: "After all, you like your job, right?"
SpongeBob says: "Right!"
Squidward says: "And you want to keep working here, right?"
SpongeBob says: "Right!"
Squidward says: "And while you work here, you expect to be treated fairly, right?"
SpongeBob says: "Right!"
Squidward says: "Then let's go on strike!"
SpongeBob says: "Yay!"
SpongeBob says: "A strike!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, guess what, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "Me and Squidward are going to go on strike!"
Mr. Krabs says: "A strike?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
Mr. Krabs says: "You mean you're going to make picket signs?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
Mr. Krabs says: "And you're going to make protest speeches?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, yeah!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And you're going to demand me respect?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Squidward, could you hold me?"
SpongeBob says: "I think I'm gonna be sick."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "Ahem."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry."
Squidward says: "Just do exactly as I say, SpongeBob, and in no time, you'll have your job back and more."
SpongeBob says: "And more?"
He imagines himself in his Krusty Krew uniform hat, except his hat is much bigger.
Squidward says: "Alright, SpongeBob, now listen up."
Squidward says: "I'm going to have to teach you how to strike."
Squidward says: "First, we must get rid of our uniforms,  That's the idea."
Squidward says: "Now, throw it on the ground."
SpongeBob attempts to do so, but the hat sticks to his hand like gum.
SpongeBob says: "I can't do it, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "This hat is my friend!"
SpongeBob says: "It never oppressed me."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, you're pathetic!"
Squidward says: "Look, I threw my hat to the ground."
A police fish walks up to Squidward with a ticket.
Officer John says: "Aha!"
Officer John says: "A confession!"
Officer John says: "Next time, think before you litter."
He sticks the ticket to Squidward's forehead and leaves. Later, Squidward and SpongeBob are painting signs.
Squidward says: "Okay, pay attention, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Now we're going to make picket signs."
Squidward says: "This is a very important part of striking."
SpongeBob holds up a picket fence on a stick.
SpongeBob says: "Like this, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Not a picket fence, you ding-dong."
Squidward says: "Picket sign!"
SpongeBob holds up a sign that has a finger picking his nose.
SpongeBob says: "How's this?"
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "No."
Squidward says: "This is a picket sign: Krusty Krab Unfair."
Squidward says: "Short, sweet, and to the point."
SpongeBob says: "How about this, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, it's "unfair," not "funfair"!"
A fish walks by.
Sandals says: "A funfair?"
Sandals says: "Where?"
Sandals says: "I could go for some fun."
SpongeBob says: "At the Krusty Krab."
Sandals says: "Hey, everybody!"
Sandals says: "Let's go to the fun fair!"
SpongeBob says: "Krusty Krab is unfair!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs is in there!"
SpongeBob says: "Standing at the concession!"
SpongeBob says: "Plotting his oppression!"
A teenager fish with a cap and braces walks up.
Teenage Fry Cook says: "What the heck does that mean?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward told me to yell it at people."
Teenage Fry Cook says: "Then you must be SpongeBob SquarePants!"
SpongeBob says: "Yep!"
Teenage Fry Cook says: "Dude, you are like a fry cook legend!"
Teenage Fry Cook says: "Will you sign my spatula?"
He pulls out a pen.
SpongeBob says: "Anything for an aspiring fry cook."
SpongeBob says: "So, did you come down to help out the cause?"
Teenage Fry Cook says: "No, I came to take your job."
SpongeBob is shocked. The fish grabs his spatula and pen and runs into the Krusty Krab to apply for a job.
Teenage Fry Cook says: "Hey, thanks, dude!"
Squidward walks up and bellows at SpongeBob through the megaphone so loudly that his facial features fall off, and he flies away.
Squidward says: "Attention, SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "You are a terrible striker!"
Squidward says: "You just let your replacement cross our picket line without so much as a single threat."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "How about I try the signs again?"
Squidward says: "Forget the signs!"
Squidward says: "I've got something for you to do."
Squidward says: "Go stand over there."
SpongeBob stands next to a telephone pole.
SpongeBob says: "Like this, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Almost."
Squidward says: "A little more to the right."
Squidward says: "And..."
Squidward says: "perfect."
Squidward says: "Attention, people of Bikini Bottom!"
Squidward says: "You have been cheated and lied to!"
Miss Shell says: "I knew it!"
She slaps Dennis.
Squidward says: "The gentle laborer shall no longer suffer from the noxious greed of Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs!"
The crowd cheers.
Incidental 2 says: "Hey, what's that guy talking about?"
Francis says: "I don't know, but he's got a megaphone."
Squidward says: "We will dismantle oppression board by board!"
Squidward says: "We'll saw the foundation of big business in half, even if it takes an eternity!"
The crowd cheers.
SpongeBob says: "Gee, I don't know what Squidward's talking about, but he sure sounds convincing."
Squidward says: "With your support, we will send the hammer of the people's will crashing through the windows of Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs' house of servitude!"
He speaks into Fred's face, and his eyes shoot into the back of his head. Then, they return to their sockets. Everyone cheers.
Billy says: "Wow, all this supporting is making me hungry."
Sandals says: "Hey, everybody!"
Sandals says: "Let's go get a Krabby Patty."
Everyone cheers and run into the Krusty Krab, once again trampling Squidward.
Squidward says: "Nobody gives a care about the fate of labor as long as they can get their instant gratification."
SpongeBob walks up to him.
SpongeBob says: "That was a great speech, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "You practically had them eating out of your hands."
Mr. Krabs says: "But they didn't, did they, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward?"
Mr. Krabs says: "'Cause they were too busy eating out of mine."
Mr. Krabs says: "I wish you two had gone on strike earlier."
Mr. Krabs says: "Thanks for attracting all these paying customers with all your signage and your sloganeering!"
SpongeBob says: "Alright, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "You've gone too far this time."
SpongeBob says: "You can pick on me, but Squidward is a great leader."
SpongeBob says: "We are workers united!"
SpongeBob says: "We're tired of your smelly greed!"
SpongeBob says: "And we're gonna saw all your tables, and we're gonna smash stuff with the people's hammer."
SpongeBob says: "And we're gonna..."
SpongeBob says: "we're gonna..."
SpongeBob says: "um..."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, what was that other part?"
Squidward says: "Dismantle your oppressive establishment?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, that, too!"
Mr. Krabs pretends to yawn and leaves.
SpongeBob says: "And me and Squidward are gonna stay on strike until we get what we deserve!"
SpongeBob says: "Even if it takes forever!"
Squidward's eyes become bloodshot. SpongeBob's voice echoes "forever" in Squidward's mind as he opens the door to his house, takes a bath, looks in the mirror, and sits in bed, wide-eyed. He seems to have a case of insomnia as the word haunts him.
Squidward says: "On strike with SpongeBob..."
Squidward says: "forever?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I bet old man Krabs is gonna break any day."
SpongeBob says: "Nyeh, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Nyeh, Squidward?"
Back to reality as Squidward lies in bed screaming.
Squidward says: "I gotta beg Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs for my job back and put an end to this nightmare!"
He runs to the door and opens it, and Krabs is there in his nightclothes, about to knock on it.
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, evening, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I was just in the neighborhood and I, uh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "thought I'd drop by to..."
Mr. Krabs says: "beg you to come back to work!"
Mr. Krabs says: "The Krusty Krab is a wreck!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm ruined without you and the little yellow guy."
Teenagers says: "Alright, Mr."
Teenagers says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "See what I mean?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward, please!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You gotta come back!"
Squidward says: "You'll give us anything we want?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes, anything."
Mr. Krabs says: "So what do you say, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Your story breaks my heart, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs."
Squidward says: "Why don't we take a little walk and, uh..."
Squidward says: "discuss my terms?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I got a bad feeling in the pit of me wallet."
Meanwhile, at SpongeBob's pineapple house, where he sits on his bed listening to a country record.
SpongeBob says: "Gee, being on strike with Squidward sure is a kick."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward's words are still buzzing around in my head like an angry jellyfish."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward was right!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't just sit here, it's time for action!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward will be so proud!"
Cut to Squidward and Krabs, now fully dressed, walking to the Krusty Krab at dawn.
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, Squidward, those were intense negotiations."
Squidward says: "I'm glad you saw it our way, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now I can fire them teenagers and get me two golden boys back."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, see you at work!"
Squidward sees a disassembled Krusty Krab and screams. Krabs seems not to notice and hums as he puts his key where the door used to be, unlocking nothing. SpongeBob peeks out from the mangled sign pole. He runs out, trying to hold in his laughter.
Squidward says: "S-Sp-SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "W-W-What have you done?"
SpongeBob says: "I did exactly as you said, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I dismantled the establishment!"
SpongeBob says: "Now we'll get our jobs back for sure."
Krabs walks through the rubble of the Krusty Krab, oblivious, and sits in his chair. Only then, does he see the debris. Only the floor and base of the walls remain, so when he looks straight ahead from his chair, he can see Squidward and SpongeBob at the dilapidated door frame. Krabs' arms pop off followed by his eyes. His head slides off his torso and onto the floor where his nose falls out of it. Then his pelvis and legs fall out of his chair.
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob is excited, but Squidward is nervous.
Both says: "Yes, Mr."
Both says: "Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "Here it comes!"
Mr. Krabs says: "In order to pay off these damages, you two are gonna work for me forever!"
SpongeBob says: "Ya-hoo!"
SpongeBob says: "The strike worked, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "We got our jobs back!"
SpongeBob says: "Forever!"
French Narrator says: "One eternity later..."
The Krusty Krab is shown to have full of dust, but without any customers. Cobwebs are everywhere. A skeleton Squidward brushes off the floor, and a skeleton SpongeBob waits in the ordering boat.
