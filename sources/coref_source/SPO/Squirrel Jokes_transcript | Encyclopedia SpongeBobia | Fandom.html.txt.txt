Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, everybody settle down."
Dougie Williams says: "Good evening, folks."
Dougie Williams says: "I'm going to skip the jokes and get right to the part where I throw pies at you!"
SpongeBob says: "I hope I do as good as that guy."
Dougie Williams says: "Man, those people will laugh at anything."
Dougie Williams says: "Hey, don't sweat it kid, I got them all worked up for you."
Mr. Krabs says: "Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants!"
Sandy says: "Go get 'em, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, hey, hey ladies and jellyfish, have you ever noticed salt shakers?"
SpongeBob says: "I mean, you fill them up every night at closing, and I mean, where does it all go?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "You know what I mean?"
No one laughs. A cricket is heard chirping. Cut to a live-action clip of a cricket chirping.
SpongeBob says: "And tomatoes -- what's the deal on those things?"
Fred says: "Oh, brother, this guy stinks!"
Harold "Bill" Reginald says: "Hey, hey, funny guy!"
Harold "Bill" Reginald says: "I've got a joke for you!"
Harold "Bill" Reginald says: "What smells rotten and puts people to sleep?"

Mr. Krabs says: "That was fantastic, boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You really knocked 'em out!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I think I'll do this joke night thing again with you as the head-liner!"
SpongeBob says: "I never thought I could be a head-liner!"
SpongeBob says: "Whatever that is."
Mr. Krabs says: "The headliner's the one who cleans up after the show."
SpongeBob says: "Well, at least I don't have to clean up my act!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Stick with the squirrel jokes, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now get busy!"

Sandy says: "Well, ac-actually, SpongeBob, n-no."
Sandy says: "Those jokes are hurtful and you know it."
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Sandy, I was just joking."
SpongeBob says: "I mean, everybody knows that you're the smartest one in Bikini Bottom."
Sandy says: "Well, I can't argue with that."
SpongeBob says: "We all gotta laugh at ourselves once in a while."
SpongeBob says: "I do it all the time!"
Sandy says: "You're right, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "I was being a little too sensitive."
Fred says: "I think she should buy both."
Sandy says: "Huh?"
Scooter says: "Hey, look, guys!"
Scooter says: "It's the stupid squirrel!"

Sandy says: "What's your name?"
Billy says: "Okay, mom."
Sandy says: "Stupidity isn't a virus."
Sandy says: "But it sure is spreading like one."
SpongeBob says: "La-la-la-la-la-la."
SpongeBob says: "Squirrely, squirrely, squirrely, squirrel."
SpongeBob says: "Because they're stupid."
SpongeBob says: "Because they're stupid."
Sandy says: "Hey, uhh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hi, Sandy."
Sandy says: "Umm, I need to talk to you about them squirrel jokes."
SpongeBob says: "We already talked about that, remember?"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob, this is serious."
Sandy says: "Since you've been telling them jokes, people have been treating me different."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, five minutes."
Sandy says: "Y-y-you see?"
Sandy says: "That's what I'm talking about!"
SpongeBob says: "Ah, that's just Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "He's just fooling around."

SpongeBob says: "Uhh..."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, what about this thing?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
Franco says: "Get on with the squirrel jokes!"
SpongeBob says: "or your career."
After a beat, he drops the microphone and everyone gasps. He walks backstage then, after a beat, jumps back on stage with hillbilly teeth.
SpongeBob says: "Howdy, y'all!"
SpongeBob says: "How come it takes more than one squirrel to screw in a light bulb?"
All says: "Because they're so darn stupid!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't you see, Sandy?"
SpongeBob says: "We're laughing with you, not at you!"
SpongeBob says: "Do you understand now, Sandy?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh, do ya?"
Sandy says: "I understand exactly what's going on, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Great."
SpongeBob says: "I knew sooner or later you'd understand."
SpongeBob says: "What a great sport."
Sandy says: "You were right, SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "Those jokes are funny!"
Sandy says: "Come on over to the treedome tomorrow and celebrate."
Sandy says: "Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "You did it, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "You get to keep your career and your friends."
SpongeBob says: "Good morning, Sandy."
He stares on; Sandy is dressed as a hillbilly with flies floating around her.
Sandy says: "Well, hoooow-deeeeeee!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, are you feeling alright?"
Sandy says: "I'm just being my own au-naturally squirrelly self!"
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, Sandy, I think something's wrong with this seat."
SpongeBob says: "But, Sandy, that, that's not a..."
Sandy says: "Ain't that purdy?"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, I need wa..."
Sandy says: "Oh, that's right!"

Sandy says: "A Watch?"
Sandy says: "Waffles?"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "Water!"
Sandy says: "Well, why didn't you just say so?"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
Sandy says: "Dumb, dumb, dumb, squirrels is dumb."
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Sandy, I get it!"
Sandy says: "What's that?"
Sandy says: "You want more?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Sandy, okay!"
SpongeBob says: "I get it!"
SpongeBob says: "Look at me!"
SpongeBob says: "I got no bones!"
Dennis Rechid says: "That's true."
SpongeBob says: "Crabs?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, brother."
SpongeBob says: "They're so cheap, they can't even pay attention!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's true, I am cheap!"
SpongeBob says: "Now, let me tell you about those fish."
SpongeBob says: "Boy, are they smelly."
SpongeBob says: "Whoo-hoo!"
SpongeBob says: "How could a creature who spends so much time in the water smell so bad?"
SpongeBob says: "I mean, really!"
SpongeBob says: "And don't even get me started on starfish!"
