SpongeBob says: "Hey, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Sandy!"
Sandy says: "Howdy, SpongeBob, how do you like it?"
SpongeBob says: "What is it?"
Sandy says: "It's a rocket ship, duh!"
Sandy says: "I'll meet you downstairs and show you around."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, what are you gonna do with it?"
Sandy says: "I'm goin' to the moon, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "The moon!"
SpongeBob says: "Can I go?"
Sandy says: "No way, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "Especially after your little mishap with my whirlybird."
Sandy says: "Besides, there's not enough room for you."
SpongeBob says: "But I don't take up that much space!"
SpongeBob says: "Mmm, cozy."
Sandy says: "I need that drawer."
SpongeBob says: "Well, how about..."
SpongeBob says: "Or this?"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob, this isn't for fun."
SpongeBob says: "Fine."
SpongeBob says: "Put me in the brig, I don't mind!"
Sandy says: "That's the air vent, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "I need that, too."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, please, can I go?"
SpongeBob says: "Can I?"
SpongeBob says: "Can I?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Please?"
Sandy says: "All right."
Sandy says: "Y'all can ride in the cargo hold if you just..."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Goin' to the moon!"
SpongeBob says: "Moon ride, moon ride, moon ride!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow, look at that pop gun."
SpongeBob says: "Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon?"
Sandy says: "Aww, hush, silly."
Sandy says: "This is for harvesting moon rocks."
SpongeBob says: "Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting."
Sandy says: "Aliens?"
Sandy says: "Are you nuts?"
Sandy says: "I've been to the moon, there are no aliens."
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, Sandy, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "How could you be so naïve?"
SpongeBob says: "There's evidence all around us."
SpongeBob says: "How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores?"
SpongeBob says: "Ah!"
SpongeBob says: "There's one now!"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob, you don't know the first thing about outer space."
Sandy says: "Now go home and get some shut eye."
Sandy says: "Be here tomorrow at the crack of dawn and leave your crazy alien notions behind."
SpongeBob says: "These oughta do the trick."
SpongeBob says: "What is it, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Can't you see I'm sleeping here?"
Patrick says: "Well, I know you're going on that moon trip tomorrow, so I just wanted to bring you something."
SpongeBob says: "A present?"
Patrick says: "No."
Patrick says: "Uh, SpongeBob, is Sandy's rocket alien proof?"
SpongeBob says: "There are no aliens, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Just ask Sandy."
Patrick says: "Well, I guess you won't be needing this alien repellent for your trip!"
SpongeBob says: "Alien repellent?"
SpongeBob says: "Let me see that."
Patrick says: "Look how big it is, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "It's pretty impressive, all right."
Patrick says: "Come on!"
SpongeBob says: "We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Wow."
Patrick says: "How do you think we get inside?"
SpongeBob says: "We don't!"
SpongeBob says: "We're just spraying the..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "windows."
Patrick says: "I opened it, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Come on!"
Patrick says: "Holy sea cow, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "This must be the control room."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, just don't touch anything."
Patrick says: "Look, I'm winning!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, cut that out!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, come on!"
SpongeBob says: "We can't hang around in here."
SpongeBob says: "This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "house?"
Patrick says: "Woo-hoo!"
Patrick says: "Winner!"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
Patrick says: "High score!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway?"
Patrick says: "I don't know!"
Patrick says: "But let's see what this does!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I don't think we should..."
Patrick says: "I like rockets."
Patrick says: "More!"
Patrick says: "More!"
SpongeBob says: "No more!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, that's enough."
SpongeBob says: "Let's go."
Patrick says: "Hey, I think this one starts it!"
SpongeBob says: "Stop, Patrick, what are you doing?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm the space traveler here."
SpongeBob says: "And I happen to know that that particular button is right over here."
Patrick says: "You started the rocket!"
Patrick says: "Hold on, buddy!"
Patrick says: "Hey, we stopped falling!"
SpongeBob says: "Look!"
Patrick says: "Hey!"
Patrick says: "Whoa!"
Patrick says: "Somebody get me down, or up, or something!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, you got your toothpaste in my peanut butter!"
Patrick says: "Hey, who turned the heavy back on?"
SpongeBob says: "We must be landing."
Patrick says: "All right!"
Sandy says: "Sometimes that SpongeBob is as dumb as a sack of peanuts."
Patrick says: "Wow, it sure looks a lot like home."
Patrick says: "Hey, look, it's Gary!"
Patrick says: "Come here, Gary."
Patrick says: "Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait, don't go near it, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Can't you see this is all a trick?"
SpongeBob says: "The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment!"
SpongeBob says: "They're trying to confuse us, Patrick."
Patrick says: "So you mean to say they’ve taken what we thought we think and make us think we thought our thoughts we’ve been thinking our thoughts we think we thought?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "I think?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
Patrick says: "You got him, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Won't Sandy be proud."
SpongeBob says: "Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "I forgot about her."
SpongeBob says: "She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket."
SpongeBob says: "But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien?"
SpongeBob says: "Aw, she'll love me!"
Patrick says: "Alien hunting!"
Patrick says: "Alien hunting!"
SpongeBob says: "Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them."
SpongeBob says: ""Uh, yeah, alien hunting."
SpongeBob says: "I saw that on TV, too."
SpongeBob says: "Gee, Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to!"
Patrick says: "Wait!"
Patrick says: "What's that?"
Patrick says: "I think I'm gonna be sick."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, do you know what this thing is?"
Patrick says: "Stinky."
SpongeBob says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "It's an egg sack!"
SpongeBob says: "Let's look at the embryo."
SpongeBob says: "Twins!"
Patrick says: "Twins!"
Patrick says: "Pardon my French, but get this thing off me!"
Squidward says: "Patrick and SpongeBob?"
Squidward says: "Get out of my bedroom!"
Squidward says: "And give me back my tentacles!"
Patrick says: "It's awake!"
SpongeBob says: "Let's capture the little phony!"
Squidward says: "Ahh!"
Squidward says: "Get away from me!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ahoy, there, lads!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Up a bit late to be playing pirate, aren't ye?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't shoot!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, okay, shoot me, but don't take me money!"
SpongeBob says: "We don't want your money..."
SpongeBob says: "moon man!"
SpongeBob says: "Look at them squirming around in there."
Patrick says: "Eww, gross."
SpongeBob says: "Well, there's plenty more where those came from."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, I think we might have to make a second trip."
SpongeBob says: "There's no time for that!"
SpongeBob says: "Just push harder."
Sandy says: "SpongeBob, what are y'all doing?"
Sandy says: "I can't turn my back on you for two seconds without you causing a whole mess of trouble."
Sandy says: "Why look at ya, bagging up all your friends and neighbors just like they were a fresh crop of hickory smoked sausages."
Sandy says: "You darned turned my little science experiment into a disaster."
Sandy says: "You two oughta should be ashamed of..."
SpongeBob says: "Nice try, Sandy."
Patrick says: "Or should I say Ms."
Patrick says: "Alien Pants."
Patrick says: "Hahaha!"
Sandy says: "Aliens?"
Sandy says: "Is that what this is about?"
SpongeBob says: "It just goes to show you: you can't trust anyone."
SpongeBob says: "So, you were an alien all the time and you didn't even tell me!"
Patrick says: "I didn't even know!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I got you now."
Patrick says: "Oh, but it's not you that's got me, it's..."
Patrick says: "..."
Patrick says: "me that's got me!"
SpongeBob says: "Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh-oh..."
Everyone else says: "SpongeBob, we "aliens" would like a word with you!"
