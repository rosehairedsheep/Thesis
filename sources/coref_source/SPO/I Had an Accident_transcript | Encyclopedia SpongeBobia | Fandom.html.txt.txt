Screen zooms out, revealing that Patrick is only playing a video game with his character while sandboarding down Sand Mountain.
Patrick says: "Aww, I got dead again."
Patrick says: "This game stinks."
Sandy says: "See, that's why you must always pay attention to the mountain."
SpongeBob says: "I'm listening to you, mountain!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't eat the yellow sand, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Oh, yeah, I forgot."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Sandy, watch me do the "Grouchy Squidward."
Squidward says: "Stop naming moves after me!"
SpongeBob says: "Everybody's an idiot except for me."
Squidward says: "Well, it's true."
SpongeBob laughs like Squidward; Sandy and Patrick laugh with him.
Sandy says: "SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "Look out for that tree!"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "Land on your bottom!"
Sandy says: "It'll cushion the impact of the fall!"
SpongeBob says: "Like this?"
Patrick says: "No, your other bottom!"
Sandy says: "Don't you have to be stupid somewhere else?"
Patrick says: "Not until 4."
SpongeBob crashes into the ground and his bottom breaks into tiny pieces.
Sandy says: "Ooh, that's gotta hurt."
Patrick says: "Do it again!"
Patrick says: "I wasn't looking!"
Cuts to the doctor's office.
Doctor says: "Well, it looks like your gluteus maximus has made a full recovery."
SpongeBob says: "My what has a what now?"
Doctor says: "Your butt's all better."
Doctor says: "It's really quite amazing."
Doctor says: "In the Iron Butt."
Tom says: "Aww, man."
Tom says: "It itches."
SpongeBob says: "Hep, hep, hep!"
SpongeBob says: "Stay away from the backside!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm warning you!"
Harold says: "What's your problem?"
SpongeBob says: "Whew."
SpongeBob says: "That was close."
Football Player says: "Hey, SpongeBob, why don't you join us?"
Football Player says: "We need an extra player."
Jimmy says: "Hey, SpongeBob!"
Jimmy says: "Ha, ouch!"
Jimmy says: "Ha, ouch!"
Jimmy says: "Ha, ouch."
Martin says: "Next."
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Squidward says: "Is this where the line starts?"
SpongeBob says: "My butt is not safe out here!"
Patrick and Sandy return from another trip from Sand Mountain.
Sandy says: "Yeah."
Sandy says: "Ride 'em, cowboy!"
Sandy says: "Hey, SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "Hey, SpongeBob, you ready to go sandboarding again?"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob is sitting in a fetal position in the middle of the floor, with a penny, a potato chip, and a wadded-up napkin lying on the floor in front of him.
SpongeBob says: "Hello, friends."
SpongeBob says: "Enjoying the outside world?"
Sandy says: "Whatcha all doing sitting in the middle of the floor like that?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, living out the remainder of my life, in safety."
SpongeBob says: "If you guys were smart, you would join me."
SpongeBob says: "That accident made me realize that it's dangerous out there."
SpongeBob says: "I was one of the lucky ones."
SpongeBob says: "I'm a survivor."
SpongeBob says: "And so I simply decided that I'm never leaving my house again."
Sandy says: "That's crazy talk!"
Patrick says: "That's not crazy talk."
Patrick says: "This is crazy talk."
Patrick says: "Sorry."
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick's right, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "You saw what happened and next time it won't just be my butt, it'll be my armpit or my forehead."
Patrick says: "Or your other armpit!"
SpongeBob says: "I was wrong to go against nature."
SpongeBob says: "I'm a sponge."
SpongeBob says: "What was I thinking?"
SpongeBob says: "Walking… My people are sedentary."
Sandy says: "Just sitting in your house?"
Sandy says: "Ain't you gonna get lonesome?"
SpongeBob says: "I won't be lonesome."
SpongeBob says: "I've got all the friends I need right here."
SpongeBob says: "This is Penny..."
Sandy says: "Well, how are you gonna keep your job at the Krusty Krab?"
SpongeBob says: "No problem!"
Sandy says: "What about eating?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm a sponge!"
SpongeBob says: "I'll just filter-feed."
Sandy says: "SpongeBob, sooner or later, you're gonna have to go outside!"
SpongeBob says: "Listen, I've told you, but I'm never leaving my house again."
Patrick says: "Never ever?"
SpongeBob says: "Never ever ever!"
Patrick says: "Never ever ever ever ever for never ever?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Never ever never never ever ever never!!"
Patrick says: "Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Never ever..."
SpongeBob says: "Alright, Patrick, that is enough!"
SpongeBob says: "Chip, will you mind showing these two to the door?"
Patrick says: "Thank you, Chip."
Patrick says: "I guess I'll to have to find a new best friend."
Patrick says: "Hey, Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Aww!"
Sandy says: "Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get SpongeBob to come outside, and then he'll see there's nothing to be afraid of."
Sandy says: "Look at all the jellyfish out here."
Sandy says: "Too bad SpongeBob's missing out on all the fun."
Patrick says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "I think I caught one!"
Sandy says: "We've got to try something else!"
Patrick and Sandy are holding a cake in front of SpongeBob's house.
Sandy says: "♪Three cheers on your birthday, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "♪Three cheers on your birthday, SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "Three cheers for you!"
Patrick says: "Three cheers for you!"
Sandy says: "Now you got to blow out the candles and make a wish."
SpongeBob says: "I don't need the wish, Penny."
SpongeBob says: "Everything I could ever want is right here."
SpongeBob says: "In fact, let's sing our own song about the joy of staying indoors."
SpongeBob says: "♪I know of a place where you never get harmed."
SpongeBob says: "A magical place with magical charms."
SpongeBob says: "Indoors!"
SpongeBob says: "Indoors!"
SpongeBob says: "Indoors!"
SpongeBob says: "♪ Take it away, Penny!"
Patrick says: "That penny has the most beautiful voice."
Sandy says: "Trampoline!"
Patrick says: "Ice cream."
Sandy says: "Underwater surfing!"
Patrick says: "Two ice creams."
Sandy says: "Ferris wheel!"
Patrick says: "Still two ice creams."
Sandy says: "Clam wrestling!"
Patrick says: "Washing an old person."
Sandy says: "Patrick, that's not fun."
Old man says: "It is for me!"
SpongeBob is still "filter-feeding," and Sandy and Patrick watch him through his window.
Sandy says: "Nothing's working, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "What do we do?"
Old man says: "I say we take a bath!"
Sandy says: "Wha..."
Sandy says: "will you get out of here?"
Patrick and Sandy are hiding behind a coral bush and Patrick is in a gorilla suit.
Sandy says: "Now remember."
Sandy says: "Don't jump out until I give the signal."
Patrick says: "Right."
Sandy says: "Eek!"
Sandy says: "A gorilla!"
Sandy says: "Save me, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, guys, really."
SpongeBob says: "This is your saddest attempt yet."
SpongeBob says: "Even Chip knows that's Patrick in the same costume that he wore for Halloween last year."
Patrick #2 says: "Hey, Sandy."
Patrick #2 says: "Who's your friend?"
Sandy says: "But--but you're supposed to be in the gorilla suit."
Patrick #1 says: "I am in the gorilla suit."
Patrick #1 says: "I thought I was doing a pretty good job."
Sandy says: "If you're Patrick, then who's that?"
Sandy says: "A real gorilla!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, they were asking for it."
SpongeBob says: "It's not like I didn't warn them about the dangers of outside."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Chip, I know they're my two dearest friends in the world, but I told them, I wasn't going outside no matter what."
SpongeBob says: "We can do without the name calling, thank you very much, Used Napkin!"
SpongeBob says: "I know, Chip."
SpongeBob says: "If I was out there, bagged by an ape, Patrick and Sandy would risk anything to save me."
SpongeBob says: "And I've got to do the same for them."
SpongeBob says: "If I don't come back alive, Chip, take good care of Gary."
Gary says: "Meow."

Sandy says: "Us too."
First half of SpongeBob says: "You know what I don't understand though?"
Second half of SpongeBob says: "What?"
First half of SpongeBob says: "What's a gorilla doing underwater in the first place?"
