Fuzzy Acorns says: "Who is this intruder that fails to attack me?"
Sandy says: "That's my friend: SpongeBob SquarePants."
SpongeBob says: "Whoa..."
SpongeBob says: "what was that stench?"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "That is what we in karate call; the Smell of Death!"
SpongeBob says: "You know kah-ra-tay?"
Sandy says: "He doesn't just know karate, he IS karate."
Sandy says: "He is the legendary karate master, Fuzzy Acorns."
Sandy says: "Fuzzy is here to test me for the highest belt in karate."
SpongeBob says: "But, Sandy, you already have a black belt."
Sandy says: "Yes, but there's one even higher than that!"
Sandy says: "The blacker belt!"
SpongeBob says: "Gee..."
Fuzzy Acorns says: "If you want a belt, you must earn it."
SpongeBob says: "Okay?"
SpongeBob says: "How do I do that?"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "You got caught in the eyes?"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "What do you think I'm here for!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Hm?"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "I am the mighty oak, and you are but a sapling!"
SpongeBob says: "Um..."
SpongeBob says: "sorry."
SpongeBob says: "I'm confused."
Fuzzy Acorns says: "I am here to separate that wheat from the chaff!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "No?"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "That last one usually works..."
Sandy says: "What Fuzzy is trying to say is that he is here to judge whether anyone is worthy of getting a karate belt or not."
SpongeBob says: "But how can anyone ever truly know whether he or she is worthy?"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "It is simple."
Fuzzy Acorns says: "I conduct a series of tests, and if you pass,  I'll give you a belt that shows you know karate."
Fuzzy Acorns says: "The first test is simple."
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Split a log with one hand chop, like so."
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Karate Man."
SpongeBob says: "Mm-mmm!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, okay."
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Please proceed."
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
SpongeBob says: "Prepare to see the split of your life!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Mastery of this test will show me you're ready for the next level of karate-dom!"
SpongeBob says: "In turn I will!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Just do the thing with the thing please!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Sensei!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "No more talk!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Only do!"
Narrator says: "Early the next morning..."
SpongeBob says: "My match!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't get outta here!"
Gary says: "Meow..."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks Gary!"
Gary says: "Meow meow."
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Where is the soft one!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "?"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "That match starts in..."
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Right now!"
SpongeBob says: "Here..."
SpongeBob says: "I'm right here..."
SpongeBob says: "I've readied myself..."
SpongeBob says: "into a full state of readiness..."
SpongeBob says: "and I am ready..."
SpongeBob says: "to be ready..."
SpongeBob says: "I'm so tired..."
SpongeBob says: "I'm so tired..."
SpongeBob says: "so very tired..."
Sandy says: "You sure you want to do this buddy?"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Enough talk!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "If you want your belt, you gonna have to tussle it out!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "So let the match begin!"
SpongeBob slowly chops at Sandy but she easily grabs his arm and chops it.
SpongeBob says: "Alright!"
SpongeBob says: "Brace yourself Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "'Cause it's about to get rough and tumble!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Most impressive, Sandy."
Fuzzy Acorns says: "But I am here to evaluate SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Okay Sandy!"
Sandy says: "Huh?"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Very good, Sandy!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "You put your opponent to sleep in under a minute!"
Sandy says: "Don't be disappointed, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "A belt isn't the most important thing in karate."
SpongeBob says: "Easy for you to say, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "Your pants aren't down right around your ankles."
Fuzzy Acorns says: "And I'm revoking your black belt!"
Sandy says: "Hey!"
Sandy says: "You can't do that!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Oh, yes I can!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "For wasting my time bringing me this sorry, excuse for a student!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Stick to something you're good at, son."
SpongeBob says: "Yes Sensei..."
Sandy says: "That was pretty low-down, Fuzzy."
Sandy says: "The way you humiliated my friend."
Fuzzy Acorns says: "The Sponge-One will never earn his belt."
Sandy says: "I know SpongeBob will impress you if you give him one more chance!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Silence!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "No more chances!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Sensei never gives two chances!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "If you really want to impress me, show me where I can get a decent meal around here."
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Lunch time approaches."
Sandy says: "That's it!"
Sandy says: "I'll take him to the Krusty Krab and then he might just find himself impressed by a certain sandwich maker!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Who're you talking to?"
Squidward says: "Come on, SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "What's wrong with you!"
Squidward says: "?"
Squidward says: "Get grilling!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward I..."
SpongeBob says: "I failed my karate exam..."
Squidward says: "Which is why I keep telling you: Never try anything new, ever!"
Squidward says: "Stick to what you're good at!"
Squidward says: "And stick to it soon!"
SpongeBob says: "Stick to what I'm good at?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward's right!"
Sandy says: "You sure you don't need an air helmet?"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "This won't take long."
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Fuzzy has trained himself to go hours without air."
Sandy says: "How about them moves?"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Pretty okay..."
Fuzzy Acorns says: "for a fry cook!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "Twenty more orders here!"
SpongeBob says: "Twenty!"
SpongeBob says: "Got it Squidward!"
Sandy says: "Well, that took some agility!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Simple parlor tricks!"
Sandy says: "Now you're convinced!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "I've seen better!"
Sandy says: "Hey, SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "I like my patty in twelfths, please!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
SpongeBob says: "There you go, Sandy!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Huh!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "?"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Maybe "squishy boy" is more skilled than I first thought!"
Sandy says: "Told ya!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Not so fast, Squirrel Cheeks!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "The only way to truly know is to test him myself!"
Harold says: "Hey, waiter!"
Harold says: "An empty plate!"
Harold says: "?"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Now, I see you're a skilled opponent!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "With a cold-blooded heart of a warrior!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "He's on the offensive!"
Sandy says: "That's showing him, SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "You gonna give him a belt Fuzzy?"
Sandy says: "Or have you not had enough yet?"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "You brought me to the dance, but the universe is cutting in!"
Sandy says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, looking good!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Sponge-Man!"
SpongeBob says: "Make the fires!"
SpongeBob says: "I almost forgot!"
Squidward says: "More Patties!"
SpongeBob says: "Grilling them now!"
SpongeBob says: "Got it!"
SpongeBob says: "Gasp!"
SpongeBob says: "Fuzzy!"
Sandy says: "Oh no!"
SpongeBob says: "Sensei Fuzzy!"
SpongeBob says: "You okay?"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "I was wrong about you, SpongeBob."
Fuzzy Acorns says: "You have bested Fuzzy, with your karate greatness!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "You are now a karate master!"
SpongeBob says: "For me?"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Sensei Fuzzy!"
SpongeBob says: "Fuzzy?"
SpongeBob says: "You look terrible!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, what's wrong with Fuzzy?"
Sandy says: "I know what he needs!"
Sandy says: "He just needs this!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "No more talk, only do!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Sandy my dear, for holding your own against the sponge, you have truly proven yourself worthy of the Blacker Belt!"
Sandy says: "Thanks, Fuzzy!"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Fuzzy!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "Why must the universe confound me so!"
Fuzzy Acorns says: "?"
