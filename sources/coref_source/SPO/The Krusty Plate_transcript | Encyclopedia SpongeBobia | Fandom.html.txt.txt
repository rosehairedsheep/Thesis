It is closing time at the Krusty Krab as customers walk out.
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, good night, folks."
Mr. Krabs says: "Come again."
Mr. Krabs says: "Thought those deadbeats would never leave."
Mr. Krabs says: "Closin' time, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "There ya go, little buddy."
SpongeBob says: "Now everybody's all clean and ready for beddy-bye."
SpongeBob says: "All ready, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Just gotta clock out and..."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, what's the meaning of this?"
SpongeBob says: "Spot, spot, spot!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's right, a spot."
Mr. Krabs says: "You know the rule."
Mr. Krabs says: "Nobody leaves work till..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "till everything's ship-shape, sir."
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I'll get this plate cleaned up in a jiffy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, and, uh, lock up when you're done."
SpongeBob says: "Lock up?"
SpongeBob says: "Wait, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Don't you remember what happened last time you left me here alone?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Should've never left you alone with a lit blow torch and me roller skates."
Mr. Krabs says: "But, since I've removed all the welding equipment from the premises, there's no-ho-ho chance of that happenin' again, right?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, get to work."
SpongeBob says: "Aye-aye, sir."
SpongeBob says: "La-la-la-la-la-la-la."
SpongeBob says: "This means war."
SpongeBob says: "Wait here, please."
SpongeBob says: "I got to finish this."
SpongeBob says: "I'm afraid this is the last time we'll be meeting like this, my friend."
SpongeBob says: "Allow me to introduce you to..."
SpongeBob says: "the SpotMaster 6000."
SpongeBob says: "Power up!"
SpongeBob turns on a switch on the control panel for the laser-particle beam. The microwave turns on, with a Krabby Patty rotating inside of it. A green laser is fired on the spot.
SpongeBob says: "Water cannon..."
SpongeBob says: "on!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hmmm..."
Mr. Krabs says: "strange vortex in the west."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, it's probably got nothing to do with SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "OK, you asked for it."
SpongeBob says: "It may end life as we know it, but I am crossing the beams!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Spontaneous molecular distortion, hmm?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I guess I better go see what the lad's up to."
SpongeBob says: "More power!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, boy, that can't be good."
SpongeBob says: "More power!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Let's see what he's done this time."
SpongeBob says: "Maximum power!"
SpongeBob says: "Ahhhhh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, this time you've done it, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "What've you got to say for yourself?"
SpongeBob says: "The platter's all clean, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, I'll clean your platter!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Come here, you!"
