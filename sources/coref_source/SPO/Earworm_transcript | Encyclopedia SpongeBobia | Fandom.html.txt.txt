SpongeBob says: "♪Doo Doo Doo-doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo!"
SpongeBob says: "Doo-doo Doo Doo Doo-doo doo-doo!"
SpongeBob says: "Trying to stop it is futile."
SpongeBob says: "So just listen now to my Musical Doodle!"
SpongeBob says: "Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo doo..."
Squidward says: "Would you stop that incessant babbling!"
Squidward says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Thowwy, Thquidward."
Squidward growls once more.
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you doing?"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's closin' time!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now get out there and swab the poop deck."
SpongeBob says: "Aye-aye, mein captain."
Squidward says: "Would you quit it with that tune already?"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry."
SpongeBob says: "It's just so catchy."
Squidward says: "I don't care."
Squidward says: "Just can it!"
Squidward says: "I'll cleanse myself by listening to a little public radio."
SpongeBob says: "Ooh!"
SpongeBob says: "It's "Musical Doodle," Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "♪Round and round the record spins all day."
SpongeBob says: "Listen again."
SpongeBob says: "It takes you far away."
SpongeBob says: "Trying to stop it is futile."
SpongeBob says: "So just listen now to my musical doodle!"
SpongeBob says: "Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo..."
Squidward says: "Figures you would be into that hideous pop fodder."
SpongeBob says: "It's a sign!"
Squidward says: "A sign that you're a true boob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes..."
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "That this song and I were meant to be together."
Squidward says: "Great, now I hate two things."
Squidward says: "FREEDOM!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "Time to hit the road."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob?"
He looks up to see SpongeBob sitting at a table listening to "Musical Doodle.
Announcer says: "And that's the new song by the Sonars called "Musical Doodle!"
SpongeBob says: ""Musical Doodle."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh."
SpongeBob says: "Good night, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "What am I running here, a nuthouse?"
SpongeBob flies through the streets singing when a record version of "Musical Doodle" is heard and he falls down. Getting up, he sees a record shop playing "Musical Doodle." SpongeBob happily takes out a dollar. Gary is eating his dinner when SpongeBob arrives.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Gary!"
Record says: "♪Round and round the record spins all day."
Record says: "Listen again."
Record says: "It takes you far away."
SpongeBob says: "♪Trying to stop it is futile."
SpongeBob says: "So just listen now to my Musical Doodle."
SpongeBob says: "♪ ♪Round and round the record spins all day."
SpongeBob says: "♪ One more time!"
SpongeBob says: "♪Round and round the record spins all day."
The next morning at the Krusty Krab, a sleepy SpongeBob is standing at the grill in the kitchen.
Mr. Krabs says: "Pushin' your luck a bit, aren't you, kid?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Musical Doodle!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Wake up, boy-o!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't you need some patties to get started there?"
SpongeBob says: "Of course."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, boss!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Just focus on makin' them patties, boy-o."
SpongeBob says: "Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo..."
SpongeBob says: "♪Think you control it, but it's way too hard."
SpongeBob says: "Every time it plays, there's an electric charge."
SpongeBob says: "♪  ♪Think you control it, but it's way too hard."
SpongeBob says: "Doo doo doo-doo doo-doo doo doo doo!"
Lonnie says: "Young man?"
Lonnie says: "I asked for no onions!"
Lonnie says: "Young man!"
SpongeBob says: "Gonna listen again to the Musical Doodle!"
Lonnie says: "Ugh!"
Lonnie says: "What is wrong with the youth of the ocean today?"
SpongeBob slides up to Frankie-Billy. As he gives him his Krabby Patty, he splashes soda in his face.
SpongeBob says: "Every time it plays, it's an electric charge!"
SpongeBob says: "You're gonna listen again to the Musical Doodle!"
At a table, Fred is eating his Krabby Patty. He turns around and sees SpongeBob still singing and his spit gets onto Fred.
SpongeBob says: "♪Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo!"
SpongeBob says: "Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo!"
Frankie-Billy says: "Me neither!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That door squeak sounded decidingly disgruntled."
Mr. Krabs says: "Why are you running off?"
Martha Smith says: "Well, I never got my fries!"
Harold says: "I never got my patty!"
Frankie-Billy says: "I got drenched in soda and it was all because of that yellow idiot who keeps singing that annoying song!"
Mr. Krabs looks up and growls as he looks at SpongeBob humming "Musical Doodle" while washing a table.
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You gotta cut out that singin', boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's repellin' me profits."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I've tried and I've tried, but it keeps playing over and over in my mind."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh-huh."
Mr. Krabs says: "Stop singin' that song!"
Mr. Krabs says: "One more outburst out of me and I'll send ye home for the day!"
SpongeBob gasps. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, as he stands at the grill, he tries hard not to sing, but while straining, he closes his eyes, but they sing "The Musical Doodle!" SpongeBob keeps them shut.
SpongeBob says: "Keep your trap shut!"
SpongeBob says: "But it wasn't my trap!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What in blazes are you doing?"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's it, boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're done for the day!"
SpongeBob says: "Try to escape is futile!"
Sandy says: "What's his deal?"
Squidward says: "Oh, he's obsessed with this artless pop tune."
Sandy says: "We gotta help him but quick."
Sandy says: "He could be in great danger."
SpongeBob runs through town.
SpongeBob says: "♪The song that you ran from is back again."
SpongeBob says: "You wonder if the madness will ever end."
Patrick says: "Hey, buddy!"
Sandy, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs run after him.
Sandy says: "Come on, Pat!"
Sandy says: "We need your help!"
SpongeBob, still humming, dances to his house. He crawls up the side and into the porthole window. Sandy kicks the door down as she, Mr. Krabs, Patrick, and Squidward enter.
Sandy says: "SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Where are you?"
SpongeBob says: "Doo doo doo doo-doo!"
SpongeBob says: "The Musical Doodle!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Hold still."
Patrick says: "This won't hurt a bit."
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
Sandy says: "Get him!"
Sandy says: "Just as I thought."
Sandy says: "You're suffering from a condition known as "Earworm."
Sandy says: "" You see, when your brain becomes stuck on a catchy tune, you're spectable with earworm infection and you've got a nasty one there."
In SpongeBob's head, a little green worm sits in his rocking chair listening to "Musical Doodle".
Mr. Krabs says: "Let's just rip the little sucker out!"
Sandy says: "Hold it!"
Sandy says: "We can't do that."
Sandy says: "It might damage his brain."
Sandy says: "The only way to drive the earworm out is with another catchy tune."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ooh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ooh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ooh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I got one!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's an old sea shanty me and me mates used to sing on the high seas."
Mr. Krabs says: "He ain't budgin'."
Sandy says: "I'll be darned if anyone can resist a Western song while wearing a Western hat."
Sandy says: "Come here, you!"
Sandy says: "That only seems to have made him madder."
Sandy says: "We need somebody with really musical talent to get rid of this thing."
Squidward says: "Alright."
Squidward says: "I'll do it."
Squidward says: "But only because you required an artist of such high talent."
Sandy says: "Oh, right."
Sandy says: "Squidward."
Sandy says: "You play that little doohickey."
Squidward says: "It's called a clarinet."
Sandy says: "You did it!"
Sandy says: "Drove the little critter out!"
Patrick says: "Hold still, buddy!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Alright."
Squidward says: "You're grateful."
Squidward says: "Now leave me alone."
Squidward says: "That was a neat little tune I came up with today, if I do say so myself."
As he closes his eyes, the earworm slithers across his head, slips under his eyelid, and into his head. As Squidward begins humming, the song he played earlier begins playing in his head.
Squidward says: "Oh, yeah."
Squidward says: "That's catchy stuff, Squiddy."
Squidward says: "Catchy stuff."
Squidward says: "Mmm-hmm."
