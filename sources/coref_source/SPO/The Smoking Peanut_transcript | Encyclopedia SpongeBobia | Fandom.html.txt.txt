The episode starts at the Bikini Bottom Zoo.
Narrator says: "Ah..."
Narrator says: "the Bikini Bottom Zoo is having its annual Free Day."
Narrator says: "Free balloons..."
Jimmy gives Monroe a balloon but Mr. Krabs, disguised in a mustache, steals all the balloons from him.
Narrator says: "Free drinks..."
Mr. Krabs comes by and fills up a huge barrel.
Narrator says: "Free light bulbs?"
Mr. Krabs unscrews a light bulb from a path light and puts it into his pants just as the police arrive and become suspicious of him.
Mr. Krabs says: "Aha!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Top of the morning, boys!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Whew!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Next stop: gift shop."
Mr. Krabs runs into the gift shop, then SpongeBob and Patrick walk by wearing zoo hats.
SpongeBob says: "There it is..."
SpongeBob says: "Oyster Stadium."
SpongeBob says: "Not only do they have the largest oyster held in captivity, it also does tricks!"
SpongeBob says: "He spits a giant pearl 100 feet in the air, like a cannonball!"
SpongeBob crumples up his hat and spits it into the air and into a little fish's ice cream.
Patrick says: "Why are we hanging around watching a cheap imitation?"
Patrick says: "Let's get over there!"
The two run into the stadium.
SpongeBob says: "This is the greatest day of our lives!"
Patrick says: "This is the greatest day of our lives!"
Clamu is snoring and gurgling.
Patrick says: "This is the greatest day of our lives?"
Patrick says: "Boring."
SpongeBob says: "You're right, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "We came to see  Right?"
SpongeBob says: "I'll try my oyster call."
SpongeBob makes a strange noise, but he gives up, because the oyster is asleep.
Patrick says: "Well, I'm outta here."
Patrick says: "Thanks for nothing, SpongeBob."
Patrick walks away.
SpongeBob says: "Come on, come on, wake up already!"
SpongeBob says: "I think it's working!"
The oyster frantically looks around.
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick, it's waking up!"
Patrick says: "Oh, boy, did I miss it?"
SpongeBob says: "No, the show's about to begin!"
The oyster suddenly cries at the top of her lungs. SpongeBob and Patrick get blown away to the seats. The oyster hops around while bawling. Two zoo employees come running into the arena.
Zoo Worker #1 says: "What's wrong with Clamu?"
Joe says: "Easy, girl!"
Joe says: "It's me, Joe!"
Joe says: "Remember?"
Clamu snarls as if it sounds like a belch and uses her tongue to throw Joe out of Oyster Stadium. Patrick and a nervous SpongeBob wait at the stands.
Patrick says: "Now, this is a show!"
Outside...
Announcer says: "Attention, zoo patrons!"
Announcer says: "Clamu, the giant oyster is on an emotional rampage!"
Announcer says: "Please scream and run around in circles."
Announcer says: "Thanks for coming."
In the stadium, Clamu is still smashing things and making snarling belch noises. The zoo worker goes up to SpongeBob and Patrick.
Zoo Worker #1 says: "You boys better get out of this area, pronto!"
Zoo Worker #1 says: "There's nothing more dangerous than an emotionally disturbed oyster."
Zoo Worker #1 says: "You didn't do anything that might have caused this horrible tragedy, did you?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh..."
Patrick says: "No way!"
Patrick says: "Only a jerk would upset a gentle giant."
Patrick says: "Right, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob hides the peanut bag.
SpongeBob says: "Right."
Clamu chomps on a piece of metal. Cut to Patrick and SpongeBob leaving the zoo.
Patrick says: "Man, if I ever see the guy who upset Clamu, I'd have a few choice words for him, like "you"..."
Patrick says: "and..."
Patrick says: ""are"..."
Patrick says: "and..."
Patrick says: ""a jerk!"
Patrick says: ""  Are you sure you didn't see anything suspicious?"
SpongeBob says: "I already said I didn't, Patrick, sheesh!"
Walks up his cobblestone path into his pineapple.
Patrick says: "Hey, let's investigate this crime and catch the lowlife who's responsible!"
SpongeBob says: "Give it a rest, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "There's no crime to investigate!"
SpongeBob says: "Now go home!"
SpongeBob says: "Stupid Patrick..."
SpongeBob says: "I didn't do anything wrong!"
SpongeBob says: "Aw, what am I getting so worked up about?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sure that by tomorrow, this whole ugly mess will be a funny memory."
He chuckles and turns on the TV.
Johnny says: "Our top story tonight: giant oyster has its feelings hurt!"
Johnny says: "The only clue that could be found was this lone peanut!"
Johnny says: "And as you can hear, the oyster continues to emit its horrible cry."
Johnny says: "A cry so powerful, it can be heard around the world."
Gary says: "Meow?"
SpongeBob says: "No, Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "How would I know anything about the oyster?"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Defensive?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm not being defensive!"
SpongeBob says: "Barnacles!"
SpongeBob says: "What is this, 20 Questions or something?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Squidward?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "Do you have to knock so loudly?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, neighbor."
Squidward says: "Oh..."
Squidward says: "that overgrown clam is giving me a headache!"
Squidward says: "I can't even take my afternoon beauty nap!"
SpongeBob says: "Funny thing you should mention that old oyster, because I..."
SpongeBob says: "uh..."
SpongeBob says: "was kind of wondering, um..."
SpongeBob says: "Let's say I know this guy who may have something to do with the oyster."
Squidward says: "You mean you know the guy who did it?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "Oh, this is great!"
Squidward says: "You and I can go turn him in!"
Squidward says: "And then I'll get so much sleep, I'll be gorgeous!"
SpongeBob says: "Um, actually, I-I'm just talking hypothetically."
Squidward says: "You mean you don't know who did it?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, um..."
SpongeBob says: "I..."
SpongeBob says: "uh..."
SpongeBob says: "no."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob walks away. On his way home, he encounters Patrick in a Sherlock Holmes outfit.
Patrick says: "Gotcha!"
Patrick says: "Where were you on the day of today?"
Patrick says: "Don't play games with me, mister!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick, what are you doing?"
Patrick says: "Oh, hi, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "I'm just continuing my investigation of the Great Clamu Caper!"
SpongeBob says: "Um..."
SpongeBob says: "have you found out anything?"
Patrick says: "Yes!"
Patrick says: "No, wait, uh..."
Patrick says: "no."
Patrick says: "And I've got a few questions for this little piece of grass!"
Patrick says: "Don't worry, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Patrick's on the case!"
Patrick says: "The truth will be revealed!"
SpongeBob runs away.
SpongeBob says: "I better go see Sandy, she'll know what to do!"
We see Sandy and SpongeBob in the treedome, and Clamu is still shrieking.
Sandy says: "Oh, I can't stand it anymore!"
Sandy says: "That poor, poor critter!"
Sandy says: "What kind of inconsiderate person would upset such a gentle creature?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, that's kind of what I wanted to talk about, Sandy."
Sandy says: "Why, when I find out who caused that oyster so much pain, no more jiggery pokery!"
Holds up the Bikini Bottom Phone Book and rips it in half in front of SpongeBob.
Sandy says: "Now, what was it you wanted to talk about, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob tries to speak, but can't.
Sandy says: "Hey, SpongeBob, how come you're all twitchy like that?"
SpongeBob says: "Twitchy?"
SpongeBob says: "Twitchy?"
SpongeBob says: "Who's twitchy?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm not twitchy!"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Sandy, I have to, um..."
SpongeBob says: "um..."
SpongeBob says: "go get my hair cut."
Sandy says: "SpongeBob doesn't have hair..."
Sandy says: "or does he?"
SpongeBob runs down the block panting. He runs to the house and tries to open the door. Patrick approaches him to talk.
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "Boy, crime fighting sure makes me hungry, and this yellow Popsicle hits the spot!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, uh, good luck with all that, Patrick, and, uh, I guess I'll see you later!"
He shuts the door, and inside.
Police Fish #1 says: "Open up!"
Police Fish #1 says: "This is the police!"
SpongeBob's eyes pop out of his head.
SpongeBob says: "Uh, uh, just a second!"
Two policefish bust in and one flashes his ID.
Policefish #1 says: "Are you SpongeBob SquarePants?"
SpongeBob says: "Y-y-yes?"
Policefish #1 says: "Put those eyeballs back in your head, son."
Policefish #1 says: "We've got a few questions for you."
SpongeBob puts them in and twists them like a dial until they are positioned. Policefish #2 taps the baton on his hand while Policefish #1 talks.
Policefish #1 says: "Were you at the zoo on the day of the oyster incident?"
Policefish #1 says: "Did you, or did you not take part in various activities of zoo-time merriment?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes..."
Policefish #1 says: "And are you familiar with..."
Policefish #1 says: "this peanut?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes!"
His eyes peer out over the top of his pants. The bottom of his pants rip, and his body falls through.
Policefish #1 says: "Just one more question..."
Policefish #1 says: "Is it true that you were at the oyster's lair with a Mr."
Policefish #1 says: "Patrick Star?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes!"
SpongeBob says: "Yes!"
SpongeBob says: "It's true!"
SpongeBob says: "It's true!"
SpongeBob says: "It's all true!"
SpongeBob says: "The merriment, the peanut, the Patrick!"
Policefish #1 says: "That's all we need to know, son."
Policefish #1 says: "Let's book 'im!"
Patrick says: "Wow, you guys are good!"
Patrick says: "I'm the last person I would have suspected, but I was looking for me all the time!"
Patrick says: "It's the perfect crime!"
Policefish #1 says: "Yeah, yeah, tell it to the judge, pinky!"
Police Man and Police Man 2 escort Patrick out.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, no!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick's too sensitive for the big house!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Stop!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm the one you want!"
SpongeBob says: "I am the criminal!"
Sandals says: "Hey, everybody, let's throw peanuts at him and see how he likes it!"
The crowd is throwing the peanuts at Patrick..
Patrick says: "I get what I deserve!"
Patrick says: "Ouch."
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Hold your peanuts!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick Star is innocent!"
SpongeBob says: "I have come here to reveal the truth!"
SpongeBob says: "They say that truth and honesty will be rewarded with trust and forgiveness!"
Patrick says: "Dum, dum, dum dum, de, dum..."
SpongeBob says: "I'm here to lay my cards on the table, to trim the branches of deception from the tree of life, to shave away the unkempt sideburns from the face of truth!"
SpongeBob says: "I..."
Sandals says: "Hey!"
Sandals says: "Just get on with it!"
SpongeBob says: "I am the one who threw the peanut!"
SpongeBob says: "I know now that what I have done is wrong."
SpongeBob says: "And so I say, I am sorry, giant performing oyster."
SpongeBob says: "I am sorry, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I am sorry, citizens of Bikini Bottom."
Sandals says: "Hey!"
Sandals says: "Let's throw peanuts at both of them!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, top of the morning!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
All gasping.
Patrick says: "I knew it!"
Zoo Worker #1 says: "Mr."
Zoo Worker #1 says: "Krabs has stolen a very important item from the oyster."
Zoo Worker #1 says: "Here you go, girl."
Clamu sniffs her pearl and the crowd cheers. But suddenly, the pearl starts to crack. And to everyone's amazement, it hatches into a baby oyster.
Baby Oyster says: "Mama!"
Baby Oyster says: "Mama!"
SpongeBob says: "Mother of pearl!"
SpongeBob says: "The oyster's a mother!"
SpongeBob says: "And that pearl's no pearl, it's an egg!"
Baby Oyster says: "Mama!"
Clamu says: "Aww!"
The baby oyster and Clamu embrace each other.
All says: "Awww..."
Mr. Krabs says: "But it's..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Free Day!"
The crowd boos as they throw peanuts at Mr. Krabs, burying him.
