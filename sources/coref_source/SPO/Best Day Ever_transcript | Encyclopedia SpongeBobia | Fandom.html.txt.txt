SpongeBob says: "♪Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Sun came up, and he smiled at me."
SpongeBob says: "Said, "It's gonna be a good one, just wait and see."
SpongeBob says: "" Jumped out of bed and I ran outside, feeling so extra ecstatified."
SpongeBob says: "It's the best day ever!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Gary!"
Gary says: "Meow?"
SpongeBob says: ""Why is this the best day ever?"
SpongeBob says: "", you ask?"
SpongeBob says: "Because, Gary, I get to start this wonderful day bringing life to a whole new generation of delicious Krabby Patties, followed by a vigorous mid-day session of karate with Sandy, and an afternoon jellyfishing with Patrick, where I'll unveil my newest, most prized possession: the Deluxe Jelly Slayer Composite Pro!"
SpongeBob says: "And for the grand finale, every one of my closest friends joining together for Squidward's clarinet recital!"
SpongeBob says: "I am so excited I think I'm gonna explode!"
SpongeBob laughs then tries opening the door to the Krusty Krab but can't because it's locked.
Mr. Krabs says: "Get out of the way, boy!"
SpongeBob says: "But..."
SpongeBob says: "the best day ever starts at the Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "Guys, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
SpongeBob says: "I gotta get to Sandy's!"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob, what on Earth are you doing?!"
Sandy says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, just a little something I like to call karate!"
Sandy says: "I can't right now, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "I got a leak in my roof the size of a full-grown quarter horse!"
SpongeBob says: "Mm-hmm."
SpongeBob says: "I see."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, then."
SpongeBob says: "I'll come back later."
Sandy says: "Knock..."
Sandy says: "it..."
Sandy says: "off!"
Sandy says: "It stopped?"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah?"
Sandy says: "Hang on!"
Sandy says: "I'm going to get some sealant and patch and trowel!"
SpongeBob says: "What's wrong, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "I broke my net!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, lucky for you, I brought my old net."
Patrick says: "For me?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, I won't be needing it now that I got my brand-new..."
SpongeBob says: "Well, actually, Patrick, that's my brand-new net."
Patrick says: "Yeah?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Patrick, it's my turn, now."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, what's wrong?"
Squidward says: "The concert is ruined!"
Squidward says: "My reed is shot."
Squidward says: "See?"
Squidward says: "I'm finished!"
SpongeBob says: "Pull yourself together, man!"
SpongeBob says: "I came for here a concert, and darn it, I am gonna get one!"
SpongeBob says: "Now play!"
Squidward says: "But..."
SpongeBob says: "I said play!"
Squidward says: "Not bad."
SpongeBob says: "Now get in there and give me a concert to remember!"
Usher says: "Where do you think you're going, kid?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm going to see Squidward play his clarinet."
SpongeBob says: "Today's my best day ever!"
Usher says: "Where's your ticket?"
SpongeBob says: "One ticket, coming right up, cap'n!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't have a ticket."
Usher says: "No ticket, no entry."
SpongeBob says: "But..."
Usher says: "No ticket, no entry!"
SpongeBob Puppet says: "Oh, dear!"
SpongeBob Puppet says: "I don't have a ticket."
SpongeBob Puppet says: "But I want to go to the show."
SpongeBob Puppet says: "Hmmm..."
SpongeBob Puppet says: "what should I do?"
SpongeBob Puppet says: "Oh, I know."
SpongeBob Puppet says: "I'll just sneak in the back door."
Usher says: "Oh, no, you don't!"
SpongeBob says: "SpongeBob, you are so..."
Usher Puppet says: "Ticket, please."
Usher says: "Ticket, ma'am."
Mrs. Puff says: "Certainly."
Mrs. Puff says: "SpongeBob?"
Usher says: "You?"
Usher says: "This time, I'm gonna..."
Usher says: "Wait a minute!"
Usher says: "Did you say SpongeBob?"
Usher says: "SpongeBob SquarePants?"
Usher says: "You're on the VIP list."
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "It is not over!"
Fish says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "This was supposed to be my perfect day."
SpongeBob says: "But then everything..."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's okay, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "No, it's not okay!"
SpongeBob says: "This was gonna be my best day ever, starting with doing the best job in the world: working at the Krusty Krab."
Mr. Krabs says: "Boy, you saved me barnacle the way you put the run on them nematodes."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, I guess so."
SpongeBob says: "But then I was gonna do karate with Sandy."
Sandy says: "I know, but you saved the treedome!"
Sandy says: "Pretty cool, if you ask me."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I suppose."
SpongeBob says: "But then I was gonna go jellyfishing with Patrick."
Patrick says: "But then you..."
Patrick says: "Uh, what'd you do again?"
Squidward says: "And, I hate to admit it, but I suppose if you hadn't fixed my reed, the concert would have been a bust."
Mr. Krabs says: "You see, SpongeBob, it's not about you or your perfect day or any of those things."
SpongeBob says: "It's not?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's about us!"
SpongeBob says: "It is?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yep."
Mr. Krabs says: "And since you did such a good job, we wanna make it up to you."
SpongeBob says: "You do?"
Mr. Krabs says: "So, just tell us anything your little heart desires, and it's yours."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ladies and gentlemen, tonight, the Bikini Bottom Players proudly present a very expensive production of..."
Mr. Krabs says: ""The Best Day Ever!"
Mr. Krabs says: "" And it better be good for all it's costing me."
SpongeBob says: "♪My perfect job starts my perfect day."
Mr. Krabs says: "That wasn't in the budget!"
SpongeBob says: "♪Sing along."
Patrick says: "♪Don't let those sour notes bring you down."
Squidward says: "Hey!"
SpongeBob says: "♪That's where it's at!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm not paying for that!"
Squidward says: "How long do we have to keep this up?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Just till his little heart gives out, Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "Just till his little heart gives out."
