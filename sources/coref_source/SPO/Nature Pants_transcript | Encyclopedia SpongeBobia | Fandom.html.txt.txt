SpongeBob is grilling Krabby Patties in the Krusty Krab kitchen until one of them suddenly levitates up from the grill and turns into a jellyfish. It floats out the window as the rest of the patties turn into jellyfish and do the same. SpongeBob follows them and flies out the window and turns into a jellyfish. He buzzes around Jellyfish Fields when he hears Mr. Krabs voice.
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, what do we do?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Here, use this!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hooray!"
Fireman says: "Hooray!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, come into me office."
Mr. Krabs says: "What's wrong, boy?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I."
Mr. Krabs says: "This is the fourth time this week I've had to scrape you off of something."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I've been thinking."
Mr. Krabs says: "We need to get you thinking about work."
SpongeBob says: "No offense, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, but I've been thinking about giving up my cold industrial life in favor of a more natural and free life among the jellyfish."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ah, SpongeBob, you wouldn't last even one day in the wild."
Mr. Krabs says: "This is your natural habitat."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "And, Squidward, I want you to have my can opener."
Squidward says: "And I thought this friendship would never pay off."
Patrick says: "Are-are-are-are you sure you want to give me this mayonnaise?"
SpongeBob says: "It's all yours."
Patrick says: "A-a-and these old phone books?"
SpongeBob says: "All yours, old friend."
Patrick says: "Ol' Reliable?"
Sandy says: "Howdy, y'all."
Sandy says: "Hey, SpongeBob, you having a garage sale?"
SpongeBob says: "No, Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish."
Sandy says: "SpongeBob, of all the crazy schemes."
Sandy says: "Why would you want to live among the jellyfish?"
Sandy says: "They're cold and mean and none too bright."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, oh, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived."
SpongeBob says: "I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy."
SpongeBob says: "Buzz, buzz, buzz."
Squidward says: "He took off his pants."
Sandy says: "I'll give him a week."
Squidward says: "I'll give him eleven minutes."
Patrick says: "Patrick sad!"
Sandy says: ""Here, Patrick, have a Krabby Patty!"
Sandy says: ""  There he is, Patrick."
Sandy says: "Say your line!"
Patrick says: "I can't do it!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Come back!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I'm not coming home."
Patrick says: "I miss you!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm happy here."
SpongeBob says: "This is my home now."
Patrick says: "No!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, everybody!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm back!"
SpongeBob says: "I think I'm getting the hang of this."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing?"
Patrick says: "If I can't have you as a friend, I'm gonna make you a trophy!"
Patrick says: "I even picked out this nice jar for you!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Go home!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm a jellyfish now!"
Rock snail says: "Meow."
Patrick says: "I can see you there!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Patrick says: "Okay!"
Patrick says: "So this is the way it's gonna be."
Patrick says: "I hope you're happy!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, that's over."
SpongeBob says: "Back to jellyfish matters."
All says: "Welcome home, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "You guys are the best!"
SpongeBob says: "I made a huge mistake."
SpongeBob says: "Please forgive me!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ah, quit your blubbering and have a Krabby Patty."
SpongeBob says: "Don't mind if I do."
Mr. Krabs says: "And I'll see you at work first thing tomorrow morning."
SpongeBob says: "Aye, aye, captain!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, do us all a favor."
SpongeBob says: "Don't mind if I do."
SpongeBob says: "Aww."
Squidward says: "Okay, that's enough."
Gary says: "Meow."
Squidward says: "Could we please stop this?"
Patrick says: "Patrick itchy!"
SpongeBob says: "It is great to be home!"
