The Krusty Krab is shown and pans to the inside. Squidward is reading a magazine and hears a whale song. He looks in the kitchen and found out it was Patrick.
Squidward says: "Can you two be quiet?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob and Patrick struggle not to make the noises again, but end up doing so again, knocking Squidward off his feet.
Squidward says: "Didn't think so."
Squidward says: "What are you barnacle heads doing, anyway?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick and I are practicing our favorite noises."
SpongeBob says: "Mine is a dolphin, laughing."
Patrick says: "And my favorite is the plaintiff song of the blue whale."
Patrick says: "Ahem."
Whale Businessman says: "Huh?"
Whale Businessman says: "Did you hear that?"
Fish Businessman says: "What's wrong, Frank?"
Frank says: "That song."
Frank says: "It sounds just like Martha!"
Fish Businessman says: "Frank, how many times do I have to tell you?"
Fish Businessman says: "Martha's no good for you!"
Fish Businessman says: "She's just no good!"
Squidward says: "Why would you want to practice such horrible sounds?"
SpongeBob says: "It's one of the activities in our favorite magazine."
SpongeBob says: "Simple-Ton: A ton of simple things to do!"
Squidward says: "It must very challenging for you!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, it is."
Patrick says: "Yeah, and it made me look more smart-like."
Patrick says: "What does the magazine say we should do next?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, let's take a look."
SpongeBob says: "I think we've done everything in this issue."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, except for this one!"
SpongeBob says: "The Best Friend Quiz!"
SpongeBob says: "Do you really know your best friend?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, this should be easy."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick and I know everything about each other!"
Squidward says: "Well, you two have fun with your mutual ignominious society."
SpongeBob says: "Bye, Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Bye, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Bye, again!"
Patrick says: "Bye, again!"
SpongeBob says: "You go first, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Oh, no."
Patrick says: "After you, old buddy."
SpongeBob says: "Au contraire."
SpongeBob says: "After you, mon ami."
Patrick says: "Please."
Patrick says: "After you, pal."
SpongeBob says: "No, no, no, no, no."
SpongeBob says: "After you, bestest friend-  -Oof!"
Squidward says: "Just pick one!"
Squidward says: "And there's another three where that came from!"
SpongeBob says: "I'll go first."

SpongeBob says: "Is your best friend right, or left-handed?"
SpongeBob says: "The answer is right-handed."

SpongeBob says: "Simple, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "It's because you're my best friend!"
Patrick says: "Aww!"

Patrick says: "No peeking!"
SpongeBob says: "You have..."
Patrick says: "Oh!"
Patrick says: "What will his answer be?"
Squidward says: "The suspense is killing me!"
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "an innie!"
Patrick says: "Well, let's just check that theory!"
Patrick says: "Wow!"
Patrick says: "How does he do it?"
Patrick says: "My turn!"
Patrick says: "But, give me some hard questions."
Patrick says: "Not like those softballs you answered."
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
SpongeBob says: "First question: What is your best friend's favorite color?"

Cuts to Squidward adjusting his boat outside the kitchen, in the dining area.
Squidward says: "Idiots, wrecking my boat."
SpongeBob and Patrick enter the dining area.
Squidward says: "So, who won your stupid quiz?"
Patrick says: "It was a tie."
SpongeBob says: "Well, it wasnâ€™t a tie, but we had lots of fun."
Squidward says: "And he's supposed to be your best friend?"
Patrick says: "I know, it's like we're not friends at all!"
SpongeBob says: "Now, now."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick may not have passed the quiz, but like a true best friend, he's always here for me."
SpongeBob says: "Right, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Scene shows Patrick outside, buying ice cream from the ice cream truck.

SpongeBob says: "Take your dirty, rotten money!"
Ice Cream Man says: "Hey, what's with him?"
Patrick says: "I guess he didn't want any ice cream."

Sandy says: "Maybe you and Patrick just need some time apart."
Sandy says: "What a crybaby."
