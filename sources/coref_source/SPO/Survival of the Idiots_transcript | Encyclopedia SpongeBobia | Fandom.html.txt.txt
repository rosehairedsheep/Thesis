SpongeBob and Patrick are running down the block jumping up and down, disfiguring themselves in the process.
SpongeBob says: "Alright, we're gonna go to Sandy's house!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Ha-ha!"
SpongeBob says: "Keep the tree warm, Sandy, we're on our way to your house!"
SpongeBob says: "Ha-ha-ha..."
Patrick says: "Yay!"
Patrick says: "Yay!"
Patrick says: "Ha-ha!"
Patrick says: "I'm gonna beat you there!"
Patrick says: "I'm gonna..."
Patrick says: "ah, it's gonna be fun!"
Patrick says: "Ah-ha..."
They freeze in mid-run when they see Sandy's treedome is enclosed with metal walls. The two walk up to the door, which has a "Keep Out" sign on it.
SpongeBob says: "Sandy?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Sandy, what's with the sign?"
Patrick says: "Look, she's on the Eating Channel."
Sandy says: "That means you, SpongeBob."
Patrick turns the TV off and puts on SpongeBob's water helmet and his own.
Patrick says: "We better put these on."
SpongeBob says: "Never mind, Pat."
SpongeBob says: "Sandy said not to come in."
SpongeBob says: "Let's am-scray."
Patrick pushes the button, letting all the water drain out of the front foyer.
Patrick says: "When are you gonna learn, SpongeBob?"
Patrick says: ""No" means "yes"!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, listen, how many times do we have to-?"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, look at this!"
SpongeBob says: "What is this stuff?"
Patrick says: "It's a vast, swirling wonderland of sparkling white pleasure."
Patrick says: "Let it fill your senses with cascading, fluffy pillows of excitement and comfort as you've never felt before."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, Patrick, that was beautiful."
Patrick says: "What, I was just reading this candy bar wrapper, see?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Put your helmet back on!"
SpongeBob says: "You know there's no water in Sandy's house!"
Patrick says: "It's okay, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "This stuff is water!"
Patrick says: "Look!"
SpongeBob says: "I guess you're right."
SpongeBob says: "It's okay here!"
Patrick says: "Take it off."
Patrick says: "No one's looking."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, did you hear that?"
SpongeBob says: "I think it came from Sandy's tree."
Patrick says: "That is one tired tree."
SpongeBob says: "Let's check it out."
Patrick says: "Looks like an over-inflated Sandy doll!"
SpongeBob says: "I think this thing is Sandy."
Patrick says: "Hibernation must mean the opposite of beauty sleep."
SpongeBob says: "Look out, Sandy, I'm Dirty Dan."
Sandy says: "I'm gonna catch you and throw you in jail at taxpayers' expense."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, you better run faster, Sandy."
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
Patrick says: "I'm getting away!"
Patrick says: "Faster!"
SpongeBob says: "Hurry, we're getting in a taxi!"
Patrick says: "Faster, faster!"
Sandy says: "I'll get you two."
Sandy says: "You're nothing but pure evil!"
Sandy says: "Just like newspaper comics..."
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "We shouldn't disturb her anymore."
Patrick says: "That's not disturbing."
Patrick says: "This is disturbing!"
Patrick says: "Hi there, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "My name is PatBack."
SpongeBob says: "Ha!"
SpongeBob says: "That is really disturbing!"
Patrick says: "Uh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
Sandy is really mad now, she's steaming and roaring. SpongeBob and Patrick run, but Sandy has them both by the their pants and gives them an extreme wedgie. They run in mid-air anyway.
Patrick says: "Faster, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "She's gaining on us!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "Stop!"
Sandy says: "I warned ya, Dirty Dan!"
Sandy says: "Now, you've just crossed the border into Hurtville!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, it's us, your friends!"
SpongeBob says: "SpongeBob and Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Please, Sandy, I can't afford dry cleaning!"
Sandy says: "Gonna skin y'all and make a pair of size six..."
Sandy says: "boots..."
Patrick says: "Fun's over."
SpongeBob says: "Whew, we sure don't want to wake her up again."
SpongeBob says: "Too bad we don't have any earplugs to put on her."
Patrick says: "Yeah, all's I got is this bellybutton lint."
SpongeBob says: "All right, Pat!"
Sandy says: "I'm gonna rip your arms off and..."
Sandy says: "."
Sandy says: "flapjacks?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, that oughta work."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Sandy, if you can't hear us, don't say anything!"
Patrick says: "Hey, Sandy!"
Patrick says: "Don't wake up!"
SpongeBob says: "See ya later, Sheriff Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "You're under arrest!"
Patrick says: "You'll never catch me!"
Patrick says: "Hey, that's not fair!"
Patrick says: "Cowboys couldn't afford cannons."
SpongeBob says: "They couldn't afford station wagons either!"
Patrick says: "Nice paneling."
SpongeBob says: "All right, Pinhead."
SpongeBob says: "Your time is up!"
Patrick says: "Who you calling Pinhead?"
Patrick says: "I wanna be Dirty Dan!"
SpongeBob says: "What makes you think you can be Dirty Dan?"
Patrick says: "I'm dirty."
SpongeBob says: "I'd say I'm Dirty Dan."
Patrick says: "I'd say I'm Dirty Dan!"
SpongeBob says: "Ow!"
SpongeBob says: "I'd say I'm Dirty Dan!"
SpongeBob says: "Ow!"
Patrick says: "I'm Dirty Dan."
Patrick says: "Ee!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm Dirty Dan!"
SpongeBob says: "Ow!"
Patrick says: "I'm Dirty Dan."
Patrick says: "Ee!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm Dirty Dan!"
SpongeBob says: "Oof!"
Patrick says: "I'm Dirty Dan."
Patrick says: "Ee!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm Dirty Dan!"
SpongeBob says: "D'oh!"
Inside the tree, Sandy blissfully sleeps until the repeated impacts cause the earmuffs to fall off.
Patrick says: "I'm Dirty Dan."
Patrick says: "Ee!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm Dirty Dan!"
SpongeBob says: "Ow!"
Patrick says: "I'm Dirty Dan."
Patrick says: "Ee!"
Sandy says: "Which one of you fellers is the real Dirty Dan?!"
Sandy says: "!"
Patrick says: "Uh..."
Patrick says: "I am?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Hot wings!"
Sandy says: "Okay, Pinhead Larry, now you get yours!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, stand back."
SpongeBob says: "I'm warning ya!"
Patrick says: "Did you win?"
Patrick says: "Okay, SpongeBob, you can be Dirty Dan."
Patrick says: "I just wanna be Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Let's get out of here before Sandy wakes up again!"
Patrick says: "Ouch!"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Patrick, but the door is slippery!"
SpongeBob says: "It's frozen shut!"
Patrick says: "Let me have a try."
Patrick says: "Well, I've done all I can do."
SpongeBob says: "Then we're stuck in here..."
SpongeBob says: "until the door thaws..."
SpongeBob says: "in spring."
Patrick says: "Barnacles."
Patrick says: "Is it spring yet?"
SpongeBob says: "N-n-n-no."
Patrick says: "I'm so cold that I'm shivering!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm so cold..."
SpongeBob says: "that I can use my nose drippings as a pair of chopsticks!"
Patrick says: "I'm so cold that..."
Patrick says: "I'm shivering!"
SpongeBob says: "Maybe we should build a fire."
SpongeBob says: "I got it!"
SpongeBob says: "We'll burn the bark from Sandy's tree!"
SpongeBob says: "The fire's not gonna happen, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I don't get it!"
SpongeBob says: "How does Sandy survive these intense conditions every year?"
Patrick says: "Maybe she just ignores it."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe..."
Patrick says: "Maybe..."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe it's her fur!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Look at all that warm, toasty fur."
Patrick says: "It's like a gold mine, but with fur."
SpongeBob says: "Carefully..."
SpongeBob says: "carefully?"
Patrick says: "Come on, do it!"
Patrick says: "I'm freezing here!"
SpongeBob says: "All right, all right, hang on a second!"
Patrick says: "Sponge, I'm a big man."
Patrick says: "A big, big man!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I guess I've lived a full life!"
Patrick says: "This is taking too long!"
Patrick says: "I want the warm now!"
SpongeBob says: "Pat, no!"
Patrick says: "No, I'm warm."
SpongeBob says: "Let me see that roll of tape."
As we pan out from the tree, we hear the tape ripping out Sandy's fur and her roaring. Cut to later, Patrick comes out of the tree with a strip of hair on his forehead and his pants full of fur. SpongeBob comes out with big eyebrows and a goatee.
Patrick says: "Man, that fur really hits the spot!"
Patrick says: "No more frozen armpits."
SpongeBob says: "And this eyebrow/goatee combo works like a charm."
SpongeBob says: "This is the best idea we've ever had."
Patrick says: "You said it!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm ready for the longest, coldest winter ever!"
SpongeBob says: "Bring it on!"
Patrick says: "Bring it on!"
Just then, all the snow stops and melts. It's springtime again, flowers bloom.
SpongeBob says: "Spring?"
Sandy says: "Wow, spring already?"
SpongeBob and Patrick run frantically to the door, but the handle hasn't thawed yet.
SpongeBob says: "Tartar sauce!"
SpongeBob says: "The lock is still frozen!"
Sandy says: "I sure can't wait to go outside and warm my fur!"
SpongeBob and Patrick frantically blow on the door handle until it melts. Sandy peeks out the window.
Sandy says: "Oh, look, it's SpongeBob and Patrick!"
With that, SpongeBob and Patrick go crazy trying to open the door. Patrick screams. Sandy walks over, completely hairless and in her bikini.
Sandy says: "Hey, guys!"
She sees all the different fur assortments the two are wearing. She looks down at her bald pink body and screams in horror.
SpongeBob says: "It's okay, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "Squirrel pattern baldness is quite common in small mammals!"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob..."
Sandy says: "Patrick..."
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Sandy, we've got you covered."
He giggles nervously. Cut to Sandy's arm pouring some lemonade, she giggles.
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Sandy."
Patrick says: "Thanks, Sandy."
Sandy says: "Spring sure is lovely."
