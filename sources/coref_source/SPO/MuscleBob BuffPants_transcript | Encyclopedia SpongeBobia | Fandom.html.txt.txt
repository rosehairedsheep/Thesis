He blows his Anchor Arms over the "JERK" size, which the anchors are now small, and the arms are incredibly ginormous. Tries to lift the anchor again but when he tries too hard, veins grow on his arms, and some of the air in one arm goes into SpongeBob's nose. Tries to lift again, but the air goes into his left eye as the crowd 'ooh's. Tries to lift again and causes the air to go into his left tooth. Tries to lift again the last time, causing the Anchor Arms to burst around his body, then explode. After the air blows off, the popped Anchor Arms deflate, floating down. SpongeBob then reveals his real arms hidden from inside his body.
