Mr. Krabs says: "Customers are blowin' in here like nobody's business!"
SpongeBob says: "I am sorry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, but these jellyfish don't want me to go to work!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Jellyfish?"
SpongeBob says: "They're attracted to my whistley holes."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, I'll never understand what you just said."

As the wind continues, the Krusty Krab gets blown off into the sky, leaving the green floorboards behind. SpongeBob held onto his spatula in the floorboards, as Squidward slides past him in his wooden boat. Mr. Krabs steps backward, protecting his cash register. SpongeBob loses his grasp as he is launched through the air, and onto the vane of Patrick's rock.

SpongeBob says: "I need a place to hide from those jellyfish."
Patrick says: "What jellyfish?"
SpongeBob says: "Ever since the wind started, a sound whistles through my holes that the jellyfish seem to love."
Patrick says: "Hey, pal."
Patrick says: "I'm sorry, SpongeBob, but you've become a negative influence!"
SpongeBob says: "Hahahaha!"
SpongeBob says: "At least the wind stopped."
SpongeBob says: "I think I lost them."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I guess I should just stay here where it's safe..."
SpongeBob says: "and quiet..."
SpongeBob says: "and dark."
SpongeBob says: "It's okay."
