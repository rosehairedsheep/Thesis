Mr. Krabs says: "It's coming up on that time again."
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, boy, fire her up."
SpongeBob says: "With pleasure, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I love this part of the job."
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't forget the cheese."
SpongeBob says: "And this part ain't bad either!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Looks good, kiddo."
Mr. Krabs says: "You want to do the honors?"
SpongeBob says: "You don't mean..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, I mean."
SpongeBob says: "Thank you, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Thank you."
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you going on about?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I let you turn the sign every day."
SpongeBob says: "As I don the ceremonial white gloves, I can continue the eternal cycle and now deem the Krusty Krab..."
SpongeBob says: "open."
Mr. Krabs says: "Neptune's jewels!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Where are all me costumers?"
Mr. Krabs says: "And just when the Krabby Patty was about to go triple platinum."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "No need to shout Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, he's right here, secretly watching his favorite soap, "As The Tide Turns."
Squidward says: "Shut it, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Gil is about to reveal his secret."
Gill says: "You understand?"
Gill says: "Them guppies—"
Gill says: "them's my children."
Squidward says: "I knew it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "In case you two haven't noticed, we got no customers!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And we're not gonna get 'em back if you two lazy Susans sit around the TV all day."
Sea Chicken says: "Rise and shine!"
Sea Chicken says: "We're the best restaurant in the sea!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Who dares lay claim to the title best restaurant in the sea?"
Sea Chicken says: "The Sea Chicken Shack!"
Announcer says: "Say, Mr."
Announcer says: "Sea Chicken, how's the flavor of that zesty sea chicken sandwich?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Blimey, this is the first I've heard of this Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Sea Chicken."
Mr. Krabs says: "There goes me monopoly."
Mr. Krabs says: "But how did he lure away me loyal customers away so fast?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, I need you to head over to the Sea Chicken Shack and see what's cookin'."
SpongeBob says: "You want me to go undercover?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, that won't be necessary, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Just look around, see how he's roping in all these customers."
SpongeBob says: "Understood, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "How do you like my new armpit spy cam, huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, I don't need a spy."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, and check this out—"
SpongeBob says: "a special spy pen!"
SpongeBob says: "Looks just like a regular pen, right?"
SpongeBob says: "See?"
SpongeBob says: "See?"
SpongeBob says: "See?"
SpongeBob says: "See?"
SpongeBob says: "See?"
SpongeBob says: "See?"
SpongeBob says: "Just a pen, right?"
SpongeBob says: "See?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Right."
SpongeBob says: "Well, you'd be mistaken, sir, because this pen is also..."
SpongeBob says: "a pencil."
SpongeBob says: "Hmm?"
SpongeBob says: "Pretty sweet undercover spy stuff, huh, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Boy, stop this nonsense!"
SpongeBob says: "You're right, sir."
SpongeBob says: "Who needs a spy pen when you are a master in the undercover arts?"
SpongeBob says: "I blend in with the common man."
SpongeBob says: "Then, like a whisper, I am gone."
SpongeBob says: "Yellow Scrubber to Big Red."
SpongeBob says: "Come in, Big Red."
Mr. Krabs says: "Just tell me what you see, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "I am inside."
SpongeBob says: "I repeat, I am inside."
SpongeBob says: "Nothing of interest to report so far."
SpongeBob says: "In fact, it's kind of dumpy."
SpongeBob says: "And customer safety..."
SpongeBob says: "a little lax."
SpongeBob says: "And it smells in here like a tuna bathed in algae after running a marathon."
Charlie says: "Oh, so it's a crime now to exercise?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What about the food?"
SpongeBob says: "I have infiltrated the line right now, and I'll report back once I have obtained sample."
Sea Chicken Shack cashier says: "Next."
SpongeBob says: "One of your finest sandwiches, please."
Sea Chicken Shack cashier says: "I'm afraid I can't do that, sir."
Sea Chicken Shack cashier says: "Please refer to our policy regarding dress."
SpongeBob says: "Yellow Scrubber to Big Red, I was not able to obtain any intel."
Mr. Krabs says: "Cut the spy lingo and just tell me, is there anything remarkable about the Sea Chicken Shack?"
SpongeBob says: "Other than the faux dilapidation, not really."
Mr. Krabs says: "What you're describing is an absolute dump."
Mr. Krabs says: "Are there any unique or interesting amenities that might attract me customers in any way?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Great Barrier Reef!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What is it, lad?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What do you see?"
SpongeBob says: "I see a huge statue depicting Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Sea Chicken and all his glory!"
Mr. Krabs says: "A statue?"
Mr. Krabs says: "How does a statue steal me customers?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Boys, we don't have much time, so I'm gonna make this short and sweet."
Mr. Krabs says: "I need an artist, someone with a vision..."
Squidward says: "Oh, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Someone among us with a big talent..."
Squidward says: "He's talking about me."
Mr. Krabs says: "Someone to create a glorious, towering statue of my likeness."
Mr. Krabs says: "You guys know anyone around here with an artistic bone in their body?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!"
SpongeBob says: "I do."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ooh, really?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Who?"
SpongeBob says: "Guess."
Mr. Krabs says: "Um, Larry the Lobster?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
Mr. Krabs says: "Old Man Jenkins?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
Mr. Krabs says: "One-tooth Sally?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
Mr. Krabs says: "My mom?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
Squidward says: "For the love of all things briny, it's me!"
SpongeBob says: "Correct."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, that's right, Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "You do dabble in the doodling doodly-doo."
Squidward says: "For those who care, I am nothing short of an artistic genius."
SpongeBob says: "Word."
Squidward says: "Unfortunately, that precludes me from doing any commercial pieces."
Squidward says: "Goodbye."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, hey, now hold on, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "You and I aren't that different from each other."
Mr. Krabs says: "We both "make product."
Squidward says: "Are you suggesting the Krabby Patties are art?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward, do you have any idea how many people come to the Krusty Krab every day?"
Squidward says: "Oh, I don't know, 12?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, that's 12 more seeing your art than yesterday."
Squidward says: "All right, Krabs, I'll do it."
Squidward says: "But I will need complete artistic control."
Mr. Krabs says: "You got it, long as it's done by opening tomorrow."
Squidward says: "Yes, tom—"
Squidward says: "tomorrow?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "As advertised."
Squidward says: "I can't make a work for the ages overnight."
Squidward says: "Art does not march to a ticking clock."
Squidward says: "Art shall come when art is good and ready, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "If you want the public to experience your cultural input, get it ready by 8:00am."
Squidward says: "I'll need an assistant."
Mr. Krabs says: "Here you go."
Squidward says: "Fine."
Squidward says: "The first thing I need you to do, assistant, is get me a giant stone so that I may sculpt this masterpiece."
SpongeBob says: "Anything for the artiste."
Squidward says: "And don't dilly..."
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "dally."
Squidward says: "Nice rock."
SpongeBob says: "Isn't it?"
SpongeBob says: "I can't believe no one was using it."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm gonna be rich!"
Squidward says: "I'm gonna be famous!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm gonna be Squidward's assistant giant rock fetcher!"
Squidward says: "Prepare to be immortalized in stone."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What do you think you're doing?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm..."
Mr. Krabs says: "shy."
Squidward says: "I am posing you!"
Squidward says: "Did you think the sculpture was going to make itself?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Like this?"
Squidward says: "Nope."
Mr. Krabs says: "Or this?"
Squidward says: "Nope."
Mr. Krabs says: "Or this?"
Squidward says: "Nope."
Mr. Krabs says: "Or this?"
Squidward says: "Nope."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, come on, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Mm."
Mr. Krabs says: "How long am I gonna have to stay like this?"
Squidward says: "As long as it takes."
Mr. Krabs says: "Come on, Squidward, I'm about to give out!"
Squidward says: "All done."
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, let's see it!"
Squidward says: "Make sure you wear sunglasses, or you may be blinded by my genius."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, yeah, just show me."
Squidward says: "Voi..."
Squidward says: "la!"
Mr. Krabs looks at the unveiled masterpiece standing before him, and his grin of anticipation slowly turns into a frown, then his body forms cracks, and shatters into bits. The masterpiece is revealed to look like Mr. Krabs, but with a sharp-toothed mouth on the stomach.
Mr. Krabs says: "What's that supposed to be?"
Squidward says: "This is a masterpiece."
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't have a mouth in my stomach!"
Squidward says: "It represents the gaping, mashing maw of consumerism and the endless cavern it creates within us all."
Squidward says: "I call it Mopression."
Mr. Krabs says: "Whatever that means."
Mr. Krabs says: "But is it safe for kids to play on?"
Squidward says: "This is art, not a swing set!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, we should do a dry run before we let the general public use it."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Reporting for duty, sir!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm gonna need you to frolic and play on this here doohickey thingy."
Squidward says: "It is not a doohickey, it's art!"
SpongeBob says: "I read you loud and clear, captain."
SpongeBob says: "Loud and clear."
SpongeBob says: "Wow."
SpongeBob says: "This is heavy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I can't let children play on that—"
Mr. Krabs says: "that—"
Mr. Krabs says: "that weapon!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm gonna get my pants sued off!"
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "You wanted a piece of art and that's what you got!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, it's a piece, all right, a piece of junk!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, if I may be allowed to float an idea."
Mr. Krabs says: "Did you hear something?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, how long do I have to stay like this?"
Squidward says: "As long as you're wanting to sell this many patties."
SpongeBob says: "I think you look really good, sir."
SpongeBob says: "You're golden!"
