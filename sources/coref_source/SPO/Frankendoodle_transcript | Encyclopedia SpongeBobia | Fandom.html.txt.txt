French Narrator says: "Well, well, what is this?"
French Narrator says: "Ah, the artist at sea."
French Narrator says: "Let us watch and see the fruits of his struggle."
French Narrator says: "Ah, it seems that inspiration has struck."
Artist at sea says: "Hmm..."
Artist at sea says: "ah!"
Artist says: "My pencil!"
Artist says: "What?"
Artist says: "No, no!"
French Narrator says: "The artist has learned the first lesson of the sea: Always bring a spare pencil."
Artist says: "Noooooo!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "Ready, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "One..."
Patrick says: "Two..."
Both says: "Three!"
SpongeBob blows a scissors bubble and Patrick blows a paper bubble.
SpongeBob says: "Scissors beats paper, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "One..."
Both says: "Two..."
SpongeBob says: "Three!"
Patrick says: "What is that thing, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "It looks like a giant pencil."
Patrick says: "Go touch it."
SpongeBob extends his arm and touches the pencil.
SpongeBob says: "It is a giant pencil, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Let's draw some giant pictures with it."
Patrick says: "Whatcha drawin'?"
SpongeBob says: "Stand back, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't draw with you breathing down my neck!"
Patrick says: "Psh, artists."
SpongeBob says: "It's a jellyfish."
Patrick says: "Pretty good, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "But it's lacking basic construction, and your perspective leaves a lot to be desired."
SpongeBob says: "Eh, everybody's a critic."
The drawing comes to life and swims away buzzing.
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, your drawing's coming to life!"
SpongeBob says: "Now that's more like it, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Critic!"
Patrick says: "No, I mean it's swimming away!"
SpongeBob says: "Do you know what this means, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Your art can never hang in a museum."
SpongeBob says: "It means we found a magic pencil!"
Patrick says: "Now all I need is a magic mustache and all my dreams will have come true."
Patrick says: "Life is good!"
Squidward says: "hair!"
Patrick says: "My turn!"
SpongeBob says: "Be careful, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Being an artist is a heavy responsibility."
SpongeBob says: "Each work of art is like a child and must be treated as such."
Patrick says: "Come on!"
Patrick says: "I was just gonna draw a cartoon."
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
SpongeBob says: "Why didn't you say so?"
Patrick draws a crudely-drawn picture of Squidward with a small stature and a waving fist.
SpongeBob says: "Hey!"
SpongeBob says: "Another jellyfish!"
Patrick says: "It's Squidward, silly!"
The badly drawn Squidward comes to life and grumbles at them.
SpongeBob says: "It's kind of creepy looking when it moves."
Patrick says: "You're right, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "We can't let it go into town!"
Patrick says: "Poor Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Hey!"
SpongeBob says: "My brain just hatched an idea."
SpongeBob says: "This is gonna be classic!"
Squidward says: "I think I fancy a stroll around the park."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward goes back inside and slams the door, Patrick and SpongeBob laugh while hopping up and down and suddenly stop.
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "I've got another idea!"
SpongeBob says: "This'll be the ultimate prank."
SpongeBob says: "I'll draw me, and when Squidward answers the door..."
SpongeBob says: "it won't be me!"
SpongeBob says: "Ready for action!"
The SpongeBob doodle shouts nonsense and he runs over to Squidward's house. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.
Patrick says: "He's going to the door."
DoodleBob knocks on the door.
SpongeBob says: "He's knocking on the door."
SpongeBob says: "And Squidward's answering the door and..."
DoodleBob picks up Squidward, holding him upside-down and repeatedly pounds his head on the ground.
Squidward says: "Ooh!"
Squidward says: "Ow!"
Squidward says: "Ow!"
Squidward says: "Ow!"
Squidward says: "Ow!"
Squidward says: "Ow!"
Squidward says: "Ow!"
Squidward says: "Ow!"
Patrick says: "He's beating up Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Ha!"
Patrick says: "Ha!"
Patrick says: "Ha!"
Patrick and SpongeBob watch DoodleBob slam Squidward back and forth.
SpongeBob says: "DoodleBoy, stop!"
Squidward says: "Whoa!"
Squidward says: "Ow."
Patrick says: "He's got the pencil."
SpongeBob says: "What have I done?"
SpongeBob says: "We've got to find him!"
Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick in a field with tall bushes.
SpongeBob says: "Where could he possibly be?"
Patrick says: "Maybe he's in that poorly drawn pineapple."
SpongeBob says: "Come on, let's go!"
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I'm right behind you."
SpongeBob says: "Baby steps."
SpongeBob says: "Almost there..."
Patrick says: "What just happened?"
DoodleBob says: "Meahoy, memoyay?"
DoodleBob says: "Meyoyyoy, ladyonmamoy!"
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Give me a boost up!"
Patrick says: "Can't we just stay down here where it's safe?"
SpongeBob says: "No way."
SpongeBob says: "I created this monster and I've got to stop him."
DoodleBob says: "Neofineyin!"
SpongeBob says: "See what I mean, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "You okay, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Finland!"
SpongeBob says: "There he is."
Patrick says: "He's hideous."
Patrick says: "He makes me sick, just looking at him."
Patrick says: "Those big bulgy eyes, that square body, those two buck teeth, and that stupid tie!"
SpongeBob says: "Ahem."
Patrick says: "Oh..."
Patrick says: "but it looks good on you, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Heh-heh."
SpongeBob says: "He's putting down the pencil!"
SpongeBob says: "This is our chance."
SpongeBob says: "On the count of three, we'll jump out and surprise him!"
Patrick says: "Oh, boy, a surprise party!"
Patrick says: "Is it his birthday?"
DoodleBob breaks through the coral rock wall that SpongeBob and Patrick are hiding behind.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Do something!"
Patrick says: "Happy birthday!"
DoodleBob throws SpongeBob, who screams and lands with a thud in the distance.
Patrick says: "You're welcome."
SpongeBob says: "Hold it right there, Doodle."
SpongeBob says: "I brought you into this world and now I'm gonna take you out."
SpongeBob says: "Any last words?"
DoodleBob says: "Bee ha, bala hala ba ba!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, what was that?"
SpongeBob says: "Hold still, Doodle."
SpongeBob says: "This is for your own good."
SpongeBob says: "I am SpongeBob, destroyer of evil!"
Patrick says: "Take it easy."
Patrick says: "It's just a drawing."
SpongeBob says: "Well, that takes care of that, eh, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Done and done."
When SpongeBob and Patrick go home, it is soon revealed that one of DoodleBob's arms is still alive. It creeps out from under the rock. Cut to nighttime. SpongeBob had just returned home. He draws on the spaces of his bedroom to make it look like a fancy bedroom, complete with a canopy for his bed.
SpongeBob says: "Gee, Gary, you should have been there!"
SpongeBob says: "It sure was exciting, but you know, I kind of miss the little doodle."
SpongeBob says: "He was like a son to me."
SpongeBob says: "But I'm sure glad things are back to normal."
SpongeBob says: "Well, good night, sweet prince."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Good night, magic pencil."
SpongeBob says: "What do you think you're doing, doodle?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
DoodleBob says: "You Doodle!"
DoodleBob says: "Me SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "Ow!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, you're gonna pay for that!"
SpongeBob says: "Or maybe it was most clumsy."
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob, what's with all the ruckus?"
SpongeBob says: "Take a look for yourself, Patrick."
Patrick says: "It's the evil Doodle!"
SpongeBob says: "No, no, not evil."
SpongeBob says: "He was just a two-dimensional creature lost in our three-dimensional aquatic world longing for a purpose."
Patrick says: "So..."
Patrick says: "he's a drawing?"
SpongeBob says: "Exactly!"
SpongeBob says: "See how happy he is?"
Patrick says: "He still looks kind of creepy."
Cut to outside. SpongeBob has just drawn a diving board. The pencil's broken halves have recently been taped together.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, great Magic Pencil, your powers are too mighty for us ocean dwellers."
SpongeBob says: "So I will send you back to the magic kingdom from where you came."
SpongeBob says: "Are you ready, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Ready!"
French Narrator says: "We rejoin the artist in a creative slump."
French Narrator says: "The second most important rule for the artist at sea: Always bring a pencil sharpener."
Artist says: "Noooo!"
