It's another day at Mrs. Puff's Boating School as SpongeBob skids along his way to failing his driving test again.
Narrator says: "Here we are again at the Bikini Bottom Boating School."
Narrator says: "Today is once again the day of SpongeBob's boating school exam."
Mrs. Puff says: "Oh, nothing, SpongeBob, you just struck another pedestrian."
Mrs. Puff says: "Minus 20 more points."
SpongeBob says: "How many does that leave me with?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Negative 224."
SpongeBob says: "How many more minutes left in the test?"
Mrs. Puff says: "The test is over."
SpongeBob says: "That's enough time, I can make up those points!"
Mrs. Puff says: "No, SpongeBob, you didn't hear me!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff, what's my final score?"
Mrs. Puff says: "6."
SpongeBob says: "Whoo!"
SpongeBob says: "And how many do I need to pass?"
Mrs. Puff says: "6--."
SpongeBob says: "Whoo."
Mrs. Puff says: "--00."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Mrs. Puff says: "600."
Mrs. Puff says: "You need 600 to pass."
Mrs. Puff says: "You got 6."
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry."
SpongeBob says: "I'll be all right, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff."
SpongeBob says: "Besides, this means that I get to be in your class for a whole 'nother year!"
Mrs. Puff says: "♪Extra crediiiiit♪!"
SpongeBob says: "What was that, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Extra credit, SpongeBob!"
Mrs. Puff says: "The extra credit!"
Mrs. Puff says: "I still have a chance!"
Mrs. Puff says: "I mean, you still have a chance."
SpongeBob says: "What's extra credit?"
Mrs. Puff says: "It's when you get credit for the things you weren't able to do before."
Mrs. Puff says: "Now, are we ready for that extra credit?"
SpongeBob says: "Extra credit!"
Mrs. Puff says: "That's the spirit!"
Mrs. Puff says: "So all you have to do to earn your extra credit and pass my class and never have to go anywhere near this school again, is to write a 10-word sentence on what you've learned in boating school."
SpongeBob says: "But I've learned so many things."
Mrs. Puff says: "Just pick one, I don't care which."
Mrs. Puff says: "Here, I'll help you get started."
Mrs. Puff says: ""What I learned in boating school is…" There!"
Mrs. Puff says: "That's already seven words!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Only three more!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, barnacles."
Mrs. Puff says: "What's wrong?"
SpongeBob says: "Got to sharpen my pencil."
Mrs. Puff says: "Give me that!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Here's a pen."
SpongeBob says: "A pen!"
SpongeBob says: "One of the most permanent of all writing utensils."
SpongeBob says: "There."
Mrs. Puff says: "Fantastic, let me see it."
SpongeBob says: "No, wait!"
SpongeBob says: "I changed my mind!"
Mrs. Puff says: "I'm sure whatever you've written is fine, just let me see."
SpongeBob says: "No, Don't look!"
SpongeBob says: "It's not ready."
Mrs. Puff says: "It's so simple, only 10 words!"
Mrs. Puff says: ""What I learned in boating school is blankity, blankity,  Blank!"
SpongeBob says: "I can do this!"
SpongeBob says: "I can do this!"
Mrs. Puff says: ""What I learned in boating school is…!"
Mrs. Puff says: "" "What I learned in boating school is…!"
SpongeBob says: "I can do this!"
SpongeBob says: "I can do this!"
Mrs. Puff says: "You only need three… more… words!"
SpongeBob says: "It's not ready yet."
Mrs. Puff says: "It's okay, SpongeBob."
Mrs. Puff says: "Show the teacher what you've written."
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Give it to me!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Let me see it!"
Mrs. Puff says: "You pass!"
SpongeBob says: "Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff, I don't feel like I really did anything."
Mrs. Puff says: "That's how extra credit is supposed to feel."
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Besides, here's your license."
SpongeBob says: "My license!"
SpongeBob says: "It tastes just like I dreamt it would."
SpongeBob says: "Mrs."
Mrs. Puff says: "Thank you, SpongeBob."
Mrs. Puff says: "Congratulations, and have a nice life!"

Mrs. Puff says: "That's preposterous."
Mrs. Puff says: "He did the extra credit."

In SpongeBob's bedroom, he's laying in bed with his parents overlooking him.
Mr. SquarePants says: "You took quite a buster there, son."
SpongeBob says: "What I learned in Boating School today is!"
Mr. SquarePants says: "We're gonna have to hold off on the driving there for a while, son."
Mrs. SquarePants says: "That's right, honey."
Mrs. SquarePants says: "Now, just stay in bed, and no going near the boat."
SpongeBob peeks out to see if it's all clear, then slides through the window and floats to his new boat.
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Boaty."
Mrs. Puff says: "I hope I still remember how to do this."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, I'm driving!"
SpongeBob says: "Who are you and what are you doing with my boat?"
SpongeBob says: "And why are you wearing that ski mask?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Because you're not skiing!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh my gosh, I know who you are!"
Mrs. Puff says: "No, you don't!"
Mrs. Puff says: "You don't know who I am!"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, I do!"
SpongeBob says: "I know that you're..."
SpongeBob says: "a boat-jacker!"
SpongeBob says: "I never thought I'd have to use this pepper spray!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Sorry, SpongeBob, but it was for your own good."
SpongeBob says: "Give me back my boat!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Looks like that got rid of him."
Mrs. Puff says: "Now for some tunes!"

Mrs. Puff says: "Uh, SpongeBob?"
Mrs. Puff says: "I'd like to… apologize."
Mrs. Puff says: "I never should have passed you."
