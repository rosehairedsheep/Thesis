Squidward is sleeping.
Patrick says: "Could you pass the chips, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "We're all out."
Patrick says: "Oh, barnacles!"
Patrick says: "What am I going to do with all this dip!"
Patrick says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
Squidward says: "What are you two morons doing?"
SpongeBob says: "Waiting to watch the sunrise with you."
Squidward says: "At 3:47 in the morning?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh-huh."
Squidward says: "In my bedroom?"
SpongeBob says: "We come here every morning."
Squidward says: "You sneak into my house every morning?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh-huh."
Patrick says: "It's our favorite pastime."
SpongeBob says: "Ah, the memories we've shared, right in this room."
SpongeBob says: "They're all here in this memory book."
SpongeBob says: "What's wrong, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Do you remember what I told you happens to my brain every time I see you?"
SpongeBob says: "Story time!"
Patrick says: "Story time!"
SpongeBob says: "Can I tell it this time, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Pretty please?"
SpongeBob says: "Whenever Squidward sees us, the storm clouds in his brain roll in and a nasty storm rages."
SpongeBob says: "So, Squidward's happy gland is forced to take shelter in the recesses of his mind."
SpongeBob says: "But the happy gland can't find a recess deep enough, so he gets the flu and has to stay in bed until we leave."
French Narrator says: "3 hours later..."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
Squidward says: "--for as long as time shall stand."
SpongeBob says: "Uh, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh."
Patrick says: "Oh."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for sharing this moment with us, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Get out!"
Squidward says: "Perfect."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, that's a nice one."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for inviting us to your big fencewarming party."
Squidward says: "Oh, of course."
Squidward says: "Come, have a seat."
Squidward says: "The picnic's about to start."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, this is so neat."
Patrick says: "I've never picnicked on a catapult before."
Patrick says: "Have you, SpongeBob?"
Squidward says: "It worked!"
Squidward says: "Now I just turn on the electric fence."
Patrick says: "Let's do it again."
SpongeBob says: "Let's do it again."
Patrick says: "Can we, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Huh?"
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "Get out!"
Squidward says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "You're not mad at us, are you, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, okay then."
SpongeBob says: "You look like you need some alone time."
SpongeBob says: "We'll be at the petting zoo if you need us."
Squidward says: "Do they have cute sea horses there?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, they're pretty adorable."
Squidward says: "And the little scallops that nibble on your fingers when you feed them?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah."
Squidward says: "Can I come?"
SpongeBob says: "Good night, Squidward."
Patrick says: "Good night, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Did you notice anything different about Squidward?"
Patrick says: "Uh, new glasses?"
SpongeBob says: "No, no."
SpongeBob says: "I mean he seems happier."
Patrick says: "He's probably happy about his new glasses."
Squidward says: "Good morning, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Honk!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, what are you doing here?"
Squidward says: "You were right, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Watching the sunrise together is much better."
Squidward says: "Hello, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "S-S-Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Aren't you supposed to be out front?"
Squidward says: "I wanted to help you work."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, that's silly talk, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I'm chief fry cook, and we fry cooks work alone."
SpongeBob says: "And, uh--  --we're not supposed to get distracted while we're cooking, Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Stop distracting SpongeBob and serve the customers!"
Squidward says: "How are we today?"
Squidward says: "Everything a-okay here?"
Tom says: "What do you mean?"
Squidward says: "How's your meal?"
Squidward says: "Anyone need tartar sauce?"
Squidward says: "I have an idea."
Squidward says: "How about a free Krusty Krab Junior crew hat for the little tyke."
Little Kid Fish says: "Mommy, I'm scared."
Squidward says: "Who wants a free refill?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Did someone just say "free"?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's the problem here?"
Little Kid Fish says: "He- he-- he asked me if I wanted tartar sauce,  and then he gave me a free hat!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Free?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Yes, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "Listen up."
Mr. Krabs says: "Me customers come here for cheap food and verbal abuse, and if you can't get it right, get back in the kitchen with SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, what are you doing?"
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs told me to help you, so I made Krabby Patties."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, these will never do."
SpongeBob says: "Besides, it takes years of practice and you'd never be up to it."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you doing with those patties?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, these are no good, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward made them."
Mr. Krabs says: "They look okay to me."
SpongeBob says: "But he's not a real fry cook."
Mr. Krabs says: "He is now."
Mr. Krabs says: "Give him an apron and put him to work."
Mr. Krabs says: "You know, he might be as good a fry cook as you."
Squidward says: "Wow, SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "You've been Employee of the Month a gazillion times."
Squidward says: "I wish I could be employee of the month."
SpongeBob says: "Actually, Squidward, in point of fact, I've been Employee of the Month a gazillion and six times."
SpongeBob says: "Keep dreaming."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's the meaning of this?"
SpongeBob says: "What's wrong with it?"
Mr. Krabs says: "A smiley face with dimples?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Yes, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "I have one thing to say to you, mister."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, I just love the little ketchup dimples you do!"
Patrick says: "No, really."
Patrick says: "who is it?"
Patrick says: "I don't know."
SpongeBob says: "The guy you're looking for is over there."
Patrick says: "Oh."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes?"
Patrick says: "I want you to pull yourself together, okay?"
SpongeBob says: "Mm-hmm?"
Patrick says: "Help me spell 'Squidward'."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
Patrick says: "Thanks, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "Party at my house!"
Squidward says: "Enjoying the party, SpongeBob?"
Squidward says: "How's the cake, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "It's okay, Squidward."
Squidward says: "I love being Employee of the Month."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, so what if New Squidward is a better cook than you?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, I just want to say I'm sorry for being so selfish, and yelling at you and all."
SpongeBob says: "I mean, who cares about cooking, pictures on the wall and dancing."
SpongeBob says: "We're bigger than that, right?"
SpongeBob says: "So, if you're willing to let bygones be bygones, then I'm willing to meet you half way."
SpongeBob says: "What do you say, buddy?"
SpongeBob says: "Put her there."
Patrick says: "He's too proud."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I'll just meet you all the way."
SpongeBob says: "Lay one on me, pal."
Patrick says: "Hey, I want to dance funny, too!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "Patrick!"
Squidward says: "What are you two still doing here?"
SpongeBob says: "What are you talking about?"
Patrick says: "I don't need this aggravation."
Patrick says: "Why are you still standing here?"
