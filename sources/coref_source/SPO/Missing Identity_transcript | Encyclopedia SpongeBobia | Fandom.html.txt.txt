At a diner, it is raining outside. A man in a hat with a suit and tie is sitting at the bar, looking for his pen. A waitress pours him some coffee into his cup.
Ted says: "Oh, no, I lost my pen."
The Waitress takes a pen out of her hair.
Waitress says: "You can borrow mine."
She hands her pen to Ted.
Ted says: "Thanks."
SpongeBob says: "I lost something once."
SpongeBob says: "I lost something I couldn't live without-- my identity."
Ted says: "So, anyway, thanks for the pen."
Waitress says: "No problem, hon."
SpongeBob says: "It all started last week-- Monday morning to be exact-- the day I lost my identity."
Ted looks at his watch.
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Gary."
SpongeBob says: "Now that my horrific incident of terror is over, how about some breakfast?"
SpongeBob says: "Blech!"
Sadie says: "What is it, Peterson?"
Peterson says: "I'm not sure."
Peterson says: "I feel..."
Peterson says: "a disturbance."
SpongeBob says: "That was the worst thing I've ever tasted."
SpongeBob says: "Oh well, at least I'll never have to do it again."
Patrick says: "Hi, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi Patrick!"
Waitress says: "Wait a minute."
Waitress says: "When exactly did you lose your identity?"
Ted says: "Yeah, and who's Patrick?"
Diner Chef says: "And why did you eat Snail-Po?"
SpongeBob says: "Ah, ah, ah, patience, good people."
SpongeBob says: "A great story can't be rushed."
SpongeBob says: "However, I will skip ahead to the Krusty Krab."
SpongeBob says: "One Krabby Patty grilled with the fiery warmth of my beating heart."
SpongeBob says: "Enjoy."
Gale says: "Thanks, uh..."
Gale says: "Oh."
SpongeBob says: "Is there a problem?"
Gale says: "Well, you really should be wearing a name tag so I can thank you properly."
Squidward says: "Uh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Squidward, it's terrible!"
SpongeBob says: "It's the most terrible thing that's ever happened to me."
SpongeBob says: "I lost my name tag."
SpongeBob says: "Pourquoi!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, take it easy!"
Squidward says: "I'm sure you can get a new one."
SpongeBob says: "But I don't want a new one, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "My name tag is out there somewhere."
SpongeBob says: "Lost..."
SpongeBob says: "Hungry..."
SpongeBob says: "Who will help it?"
SpongeBob says: "What if someone's using it?"
Bank Robber says: "Alright!"
Bank Robber says: "Nobody move!"
Bank Robber says: "This is a bank robbery!"
Bank Robber says: "Attica!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm innocent, I tell ya!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, what happened?"
Squidward says: "Hmm?"
Squidward says: "Oh, you fainted because you lost your name tag or something."
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, will you get a hold of yourself?"
Squidward says: "Since when is losing your name tag the end of the world?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Attention, all employees!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Just a quick heads-up, boys."
Mr. Krabs says: "There's going to be a surprise uniform inspection in one hour."
Mr. Krabs says: "Anyone who doesn't pass gets the boot!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, if you really want to find your name tag, just retrace your steps."
SpongeBob says: "Retrace my steps?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, you're a genius."
Squidward says: "Huh."
Squidward says: "Huh."
Squidward says: "A genius?"
Squidward says: "Well, I don't know about that, but..."
SpongeBob says: "Cover me till I get back, okay?"
Squidward says: "Oh, sure, sure."
SpongeBob says: "Let's see, if I'm going to retrace my steps, I got to remember everything I did this morning."
Patrick says: "Hi, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hi Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "You said hi to me this morning, right?"
Patrick says: "As I do every morning."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I need you to do it again."
Patrick says: "That wasn't part of the deal, SquarePants!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what are you talking about?"
Patrick says: "My hellos aren't just some tape recording that you can rewind and play over and over."
Patrick says: "They're special!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, this is an emergency!"
SpongeBob says: "I lost my name tag this morning, and I need to retrace my steps!"
Patrick says: "You lost your name tag?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Patrick, you know the plan, right?"
Patrick says: "I got it, I got it."
Patrick says: "You're gonna retrace your steps and when you walk by me I say "hi", just like this morning."
SpongeBob says: "Perfect."
SpongeBob says: "Hmm, I guess I should start with when I woke up."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
Patrick says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "You were supposed to say hi to me!"
Patrick says: "Hi."
SpongeBob says: "Oh."
SpongeBob says: "All right, let's take it from the top."
Patrick says: "Hi, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Don't forget your line this time!"
Patrick says: "I won't."
SpongeBob says: "Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, why didn't you say hi to me?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "What's my motivation?"
Patrick says: "Hi, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Oh wait, I'm Patrick!"
Patrick says: "I'm sorry."
Patrick says: "Sorry."
Patrick says: "Again, again."
Patrick says: "Sorry people."
SpongeBob says: "Blech!"
Patrick says: "I've got the giggles."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, what's the use?"
SpongeBob says: "I'll never find my name tag in time for inspection."
Patrick says: "Well, what did you do after I said hi to you this morning?"
SpongeBob says: "Hmm, let's see."
Thought SpongeBob says: "Hi, Mr."
Thought SpongeBob says: "J."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "placed an apple on Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs' desk..."
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
Patrick says: "That's it!"
Patrick says: "Your name tag is in the apple on Mr."
Patrick says: "Krabs' desk!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you're a genius."
SpongeBob says: "Oh wait, he's probably thrown it away by now."
Patrick says: "Well, then we'll look in the dumpster!"
SpongeBob says: "Eh, what is that stench?"
Patrick says: "That is the stench of discovery."
Patrick says: "Come on, buddy."
Patrick says: "I'll give you a boost."
Patrick says: "Hop on, pal."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, it's not so bad once you get used to it."
Patrick says: "I wish I had a nose."
SpongeBob says: "Come on in, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "The garbage is fine."
Patrick says: "Cannonball!"
SpongeBob says: "You look over there and I'll look over here."
Patrick says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Patrick says: "I'm looking."
Patrick says: "I'm looking."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
Patrick says: "I'm looking as fast as I can."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Here, let me get that."
Patrick says: "Hey, look!"
Patrick says: "A Stingray 5000 single."
Patrick says: "Hey, these guys rock."
Patrick says: "Why would anybody throw this away?"
SpongeBob says: "Have you  forgotten what we're looking for knee-deep in yesterday's Top 40 songs?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "Yes."
SpongeBob says: "I'll give you a hint."
SpongeBob says: "Two words."
SpongeBob says: "First word: my."
SpongeBob says: "Second word: name tag."
Patrick says: "Could I have another hint?"
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob..."
SpongeBob says: "Not now, Patrick."
Patrick says: "I know where your name tag is."
SpongeBob says: "Where?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Where?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "Uh..."
Patrick says: "I can't remember."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I don't have time for this!"
Patrick says: "There it is!"
SpongeBob says: "Where?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "Uh..."
Patrick says: "I forgot again."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, are you with me or against me?"
Patrick says: "Could you give me a hint?"
Patrick says: "There!"
Patrick says: "I see it!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah..."
SpongeBob says: "the boy who cried name tag."
SpongeBob says: "If you're not going to help me, then just go crawl back under your rock!"
Patrick says: "Well, at least I don't wear my shirt backwards."
SpongeBob says: "My shirt backward..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Fall in for inspection!"
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, you two..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hmm, promise me you'll shave tonight and you pass."
Squidward says: "Hoorah."
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, boy, your turn."
SpongeBob says: "I think you'll find everything shipshape."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ack!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Jumpin' jellyfish!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's that stench?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh..."
SpongeBob says: "discovery?"
Waitress says: "Well, you managed to kill eleven minutes."
SpongeBob says: "Betty."
Waitress says: "What?"
