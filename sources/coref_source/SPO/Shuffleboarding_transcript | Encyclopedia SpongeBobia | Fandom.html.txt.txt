Narrator says: "Shady Shoals, mild mannered rest home and secret headquarters of Mermaid Man, Master of maritime justice and defender of Bikini Bottom."
Mermaid Man says: "Semi-retired!"
Narrator says: "And his faithful ward, Barnacle Boy."
Mermaid Man says: "Who?"
Barnacle Boy says: "Hello."
Narrator says: "Today, we find this duo of dynamism engaged in their favorite pastime, watching TV."
REMOTE! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy immediately fall asleep. NAP!
Narrator says: "But wait, what's this?"
Narrator says: "Why, it's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's biggest fans."
Narrator says: "SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star."
SpongeBob says: "Don't they look peaceful?"
Patrick says: "Yeah..."
Patrick says: "Wake up!"
Mermaid Man says: "Ahhhh!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Ahhhh!"
Mermaid Man says: "I'll deal with these super villains with my trusty Mermarang!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Hey, those aren't super villains."
Mermaid Man throws his Mermarang at SpongeBob.
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Mermai..."
SpongeBob says: "Umph!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't believe Mermaid Man hit me with his Mermarang..."
SpongeBob says: "It's so awesome!"
Patrick says: "Wow!"
Patrick says: "Can you beat me up next?"
Mermaid Man says: "Keep on your guard, Barnacle Boy!"
Mermaid Man says: "They're getting ready for another attack!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Those aren't super villains."
Barnacle Boy says: "It's just that kid, uh, SpongeBob and his goofy friend."
Barnacle Boy says: "Hey, kid, can you give us our Mermarang back?"
Barnacle Boy says: "We only got the one."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, sure thing."
Barnacle Boy says: "Oh, don't throw..."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, It came back!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Ya, it does that."
SpongeBob says: "I'll try again."
Barnacle Boy says: "No!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Ahhh!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Umph!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Oh!"
Again, the Mermarang flies back to SpongeBob.
Barnacle Boy says: "Look, I'll just come and get..."
Barnacle Boy says: "What is wrong with you?"
Mermaid Man says: "Nice shot!"
Patrick says: "Wow!"
Patrick says: "That Mermarang really likes you!"
SpongeBob says: "I know!"
Mermaid Man says: "Now just hand me the Mermarang, son."
SpongeBob says: "Runaway Mermarang!!!"
Patrick says: "Runaway Mermarang!!!"
PANIC! All the old people start running around creating chaos.. The Mermarang hits Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy again. Both of them fall back on their couch and are dumped into the Mermalair. SpongeBob and Patrick follow.
Mermaid Man says: "Ahhhhh!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Ahhhhh!"
They stand up and then SpongeBob and Patrick land onto them.. Pause. The Mermarang falls onto Barnacle Boy's head one last time.
Barnacle Boy says: "Ow!"
The heroes end up in the Bikini Bottom Hospital. Barnacle Boy is waking up and SpongeBob is right in his face.
SpongeBob says: "Hi..."
SpongeBob says: "How ya feeling?"
Barnacle Boy says: "Would you get off of me?!"
Barnacle Boy says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
Barnacle Boy says: "What are you two doing here anyway?!"
Barnacle Boy says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "I almost forgot!"
SpongeBob says: "I brought you flowers!"
SpongeBob says: "Since you two are feeling so poorly."
Patrick says: "You never brought me flowers."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, go home and check your mailbox."
Patrick says: "Really?"
Ring Ring.
Mermaid Man says: "The Mermaphone!"
Mermaid Man says: "Mermaid Man here!"
Mermaid Man says: "Ah, Commissioner!"
Mermaid Man says: "What can I do for you?"
Commissioner says: "Bla bla bla, bla bla bla bla bla."
Mermaid Man says: "You can count on Mermaid Man, commissioner!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Barnacle Boy here."
Commissioner says: "Bla bla bla, bla bla bla."
Barnacle Boy says: "Yes, but..."
Commissioner says: "Bla bla bla bla."
Barnacle Boy says: "Yes, yes, commissioner..."
Barnacle Boy says: "But, uh."
Barnacle Boy says: "The police commissioner needs us to be celebrity contestants at the Bikini Bottom Shuffle Boarding Competition."
Barnacle Boy says: "But there's no way we can do it in this condition!"
Mermaid Man says: "What kind of quitter talk is that!"
Mermaid Man says: "?"
Mermaid Man says: "We're super heroes!"
Mermaid Man says: "We're going to that shuffle boarding competition, or my name isn't..."
Mermaid Man says: "Owww!"
Mermaid Man says: "You're right, Barnacle Boy, if only there was someone to take our place."
SpongeBob says: "Mmmm..."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick and I can do it, Mermaid Man!"
Barnacle Boy says: "What?"
Barnacle Boy says: "Why should we trust you two?"
SpongeBob says: "Because, we're card carrying members of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fan club."
Barnacle Boy says: "So?"
SpongeBob says: "We're also certified Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy impersonators."
Patrick says: "Certified!"
Mermaid Man says: "You can't argue with certification!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Ohhhh..."
Barnacle Boy says: "All right."
Barnacle Boy says: "I suppose they can't do too much damage."
Barnacle Boy says: "It's just shuffle boarding..."
Barnacle Boy says: "umph!"
SpongeBob and Patrick both start jumping on Barnacle Boy.
SpongeBob says: "Yay!"
Patrick says: "Yay!"
SpongeBob says: "We're going to be heroes!"
Patrick says: "We're going to be heroes!"
SpongeBob says: "We're going to be heroes!"
Patrick says: "We're going to be heroes!"
Patrick says: "Yay!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Would you cut it out?!"
Barnacle Boy says: "!"
Patrick says: "..."
Patrick says: "oes?"
Barnacle Boy says: "Now, listen up!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Here, take these rings."
BLING! Dramatic music plays.
SpongeBob says: "Ohhhh!"
Patrick says: "Ohhhh!"
Barnacle Boy says: "And when you touch 'em together, you will be instantly transformed into our duplicates."
SpongeBob says: "We're ready!"
SpongeBob says: "Man Bob!"
Patrick says: "And Pat Boy!"
SpongeBob says: "Reporting for duty!"
Patrick says: "Reporting for duty!"
Barnacle Boy says: "When you're through with shuffle boarding, you are to bring those costumes right back here!"
Barnacle Boy says: "And don't do anything else."
Barnacle Boy says: "Don't go home first, don't show your friends, just come right back here!"
Barnacle Boy says: "You got it?!"
Barnacle Boy says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Got it!"
Patrick says: "Got what?"
Barnacle Boy says: "This'll never work."
Mermaid Man says: "What will never work?"
Later.
SpongeBob says: "Shuffle boarding, shuffle boarding, shuffle boarding ya/ woohoo!"
Patrick says: "Shuffle boarding, shuffle boarding, shuffle boarding ya/ woohoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Shuffle boarding is exciting, huh, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Well, duh!"
SpongeBob says: "What's your favorite thing about shuffle boarding?"
Patrick says: "Everything!"
Patrick says: "It's even fun just to say the word!"
Patrick says: "Shee-uf-fle-boarde!"
SpongeBob says: "Shu-ee-uu-ee-ufflelele-board!"
SpongeBob says: "It is fun!"
Patrick says: "We are seriously going to kick some elderly buns today!"
Patrick says: "Huh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "Um, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "It's going to be and action packed thrill ride of geriatric proportions!"
Patrick says: "And the best part is, there is no way we can lose with these costumes on!"
SpongeBob says: "We already won the tournament."
Patrick says: "Oh..."
Patrick says: "ya, I forgot."
Patrick says: "Well, how come I didn't get a trophy?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "You did, it's in your back pocket."
Patrick says: "Oh, yeah."
Patrick says: "I forgot."
Patrick says: "Well Let's go do something else."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
They start walking when SpongeBob remembers..
Barnacle Boy says: "You are to bring those costumes right back here!"
Barnacle Boy says: "Don't do anything else!"
SpongeBob says: "We can't."
SpongeBob says: "We have to get the costumes back."
Patrick says: "For Neptune's sake, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "If we're not going to go around town pretending to be Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, then who is?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Nobody?"
Patrick says: "Exactly."
Patrick says: "And with no one patrolling the town, who's gonna stop those youngsters from loitering?"
SpongeBob says: "Their mommies?"
Patrick says: "No!"
Patrick says: "We are!"
Patrick says: "Let's take 'em to the slammer!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't you think that's too harsh?"
Patrick says: "Too harsh?"
Patrick says: "Explain."
SpongeBob says: "Wasting a Krabby Patty?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "How could you?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Bikini Bottom Prison Guard says: "I'm full."
They throw the security guard into the jail cell.
SpongeBob says: "Well, maybe somebody should have thought about that before they ponied up for the world's greatest patty!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Jail Warden!"
SpongeBob and Patrick come out of the jail gates.
SpongeBob says: "You're right, Patboy!"
SpongeBob says: "This town needs us!"
Guy chewing on gum blows a bubble and it pops.
Patrick says: "You're chewing too loud!"
SpongeBob says: "Your shoe's untied!"
Patrick says: "You're too old!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I think we've done our work, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Now, let's return these costumes."
SpongeBob sees Man Ray walking into a Laundromat.
SpongeBob says: "That's the evil Man Ray!"
Man Ray hums Sas he puts in some clothes in the washer. SpongeBob and Patrick are outside the window. What diabolical plan could he be up to!?
Mable says: "Why,hello, Ray!"
Man Ray says: "Mable!"
Man Ray says: "I haven't seen you since high school."
SpongeBob says: "Look at him, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Plotting with his evil minion!"
Mable says: "Say, could I borrow some of your detergent?"
Man Ray says: "Why certainly."
Man Ray says: "Anything for the gal I went to the prom with."
SpongeBob says: "I'll bet he's handing off some secret weapon!"
SpongeBob says: "Time to crash this party!"
Mable says: "You haven't aged a day, Ray!"
Man Ray says: "Nor you."
SpongeBob says: "Hello, Man Ray!"
SpongeBob says: "Who's your friend?"
Man Ray says: "Hey, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!"
Man Ray says: "I'd like you to meet Mable!"
Mable says: "Any friend of Ray's is a friend of mine."
SpongeBob says: "Alright, Mable, that's enough chitchat!"
SpongeBob says: "Now are you gonna come quietly, or will we have to take you to jail by force!"
SpongeBob says: "?"
Everyone pauses for a second.
SpongeBob says: "Playing dumb, eh?"
Patrick says: "You handle Man Ray, I'll take care of his lackey."
Man Ray says: "Mable?!"
Man Ray says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Hiiiii-ya!"
SpongeBob says: "Eat dryer sheets, Man Ray!"
Man Ray says: "Ahhhh!"
Man Ray says: "Grrr..."
Man Ray says: "You!"
Man Ray says: "It's on now!"
Man Ray says: "Filthy shorts attack!"
SpongeBob says: "Whooooaaa!"
Man Ray says: "Clothes basket bombardment!"
Patrick says: "Ohhhh!"
Man Ray says: "Surrender..."
Man Ray says: "Mermaid Man?"
SpongeBob says: "Not so fast, Man Ray!"
SpongeBob opens a dryer door.
Man Ray says: "What?!"
Man Ray says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "You're all wet, you need to dry out."
SpongeBob closes the door and sets the dryer to shrink.
Man Ray says: "What?!"
Man Ray says: "!"
Man Ray says: "No!"
Man Ray says: "My head is dry clean only!"
After that, Man Ray's head has shrunk.
Man Ray says: "But I didn't do anything!"
SpongeBob says: "Just keep moving."
Patrick says: "You too, missy."
SpongeBob and Patrick put them in Jail. The jail is bulging now.
SpongeBob says: "Well, our work is done here."
The jail explodes. People land everywhere until the ambulance comes and carried away poor people and some of them saying “My leg!”.
At the Hospital.
Mermaid Man says: "Good job, boys!"
Mermaid Man says: "You won the tournament and returned the costumes."
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy raise their rings and the costumes are sucked up into the rings. SpongeBob and Patrick wheel Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy outside.
Mermaid Man says: "Thanks again, boys!"
SpongeBob says: "Just doing our Mermaduty."
Patrick says: "And then some."
SpongeBob says: "That's a good one!"
Mermaid Man says: "Goodbye, young men!"
Mermaid Man says: "Oh, look!"
Mermaid Man says: "We have more visitors!"
Mermaid Man says: "Looking good, Man Ray!"
All start to close in. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are wheeling, in their wheelchairs, as fast as they can.
Barnacle Boy says: "Faster, you ol' coot!"
