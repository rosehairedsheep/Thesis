At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is sniffing a Krabby Patty, then squirts a mustard "checkmark" on the patty and puts on the bun. Just then, SpongeBob hears Pearl come in crying. SpongeBob gets a pan and puts it on top of his head for protection from the tears.
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't cry, love."
Mr. Krabs says: "Daddy's going to make it all right."
Mr. Krabs says: "Calm down, girl!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, what's wrong with Pearl?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Her scurvy prom date stood her up, boy, and now, she can't seem to find another."
Pearl says: "That's because there's only one fish in the sea that's long, tan and handsome as he is."
Pearl says: "And that's him!"
Mr. Krabs says: "No, no, baby, no more crying."
Mr. Krabs says: "We'll get you a date."
Mr. Krabs says: "Why, uhh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll take ya!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait, wait."
Mr. Krabs says: "Here, take SpongeBob!"
Pearl says: "Ahh!"
Pearl says: "the fry cook?"
Pearl says: "Do you know what that would do to my complexion?"
Pearl says: "People would mistake me for a planetarium."
Mr. Krabs says: "What do you mean?"
Pearl says: "I don't know."
Pearl says: "But I can't take him, daddy!"
Pearl says: "They'll kick me off the most frequently pictured in the yearbook committee."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, they would."
Mr. Krabs says: "We've got to find someone else."
Mr. Krabs says: "Listen up!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Which one of you lucky lubbers wants to take me lovely daughter Pearl to the prom?"
Pearl says: "Just don't be late, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now listen, boy, I'm-a counting on you to make this a very special night for a very special girl."
Mr. Krabs says: "Remember, you're doing it for good old Mr..."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hi, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Are you talking to that dummy I made?"
SpongeBob says: "It's pretty realistic isn't it?"
SpongeBob says: "I made this part out of..."

SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I am a prom expert!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Gary, I'm a prom failure."
SpongeBob says: "I couldn't even get a date for my own junior prom."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "No, that was Patrick who brought his mom."
SpongeBob says: "Besides, how am I supposed to compare with Pearl's old boyfriend, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Long, Tan and Handsome?"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "What is it, Gary?"
SpongeBob says: "What do you have?"
