Squidward says: "Huh?"
Squidward says: "A brand-new television?"
SpongeBob says: "Easy..."
SpongeBob says: "easy..."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
Squidward says: "Just when I thought they couldn't get any stupider."
Squidward says: "Let me get this straight, you two ordered a giant screen television just so you could play in the box?"
SpongeBob says: "Pretty smart, huh?"
Patrick says: "I thought it wouldn't work."
Squidward says: "Yeah, that's quite a plan there."
Squidward says: "Oh, but wait, there was something else I wanted to ask you two."

SpongeBob says: "With..."
SpongeBob says: "Hup!"
Patrick says: "A starfish!"
Squidward says: "Patrick, you're already a starfish."
Patrick says: "See, Squidward?"

SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick, I can't do that!"
Patrick says: "Why not?"
SpongeBob says: "Because I already cut off my own arms!"
Patrick says: "Nooooo!"
Squidward quickly opens the box and looks in. SpongeBob and Patrick sit inside the box.
Squidward says: "What the?"
Squidward says: "How were you two making that noise?"
SpongeBob says: "What noise, Squidward?"
Patrick says: "I could only hear the sound of our laughter."
Squidward says: "Yes!"
