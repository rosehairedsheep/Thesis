Patrick says: "Nah."
SpongeBob says: "How about this?"
Old Man Walker says: "Hello."
Patrick says: "Uh-uh."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, we could play with our Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy action figures!"
SpongeBob says: "Ew."
SpongeBob says: "Barnacle Boy's all chewed up."
SpongeBob says: "And slimy."
Patrick says: "Yeah, that'll happen."
SpongeBob says: "Ugh, there is just nothing to play with."
Patrick says: "There's gotta be something we can do."
Squidward says: "Ladda-de ladd-dum ladda-do..."
Squidward says: "Hey!"
Squidward says: "What are you doing in my house?"
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Can you think of anything fun we can do?"
Squidward says: "Get out!"
Patrick says: "Well, yeah, we thought of that one."
Old Man Walker says: "Where are we goin' now, boys?"
Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick walking outside, bored. Patrick slumps over so that he is pushing his head along the ground. He stops and SpongeBob walks into him.
Patrick says: "Ugh."
Patrick says: "I'm so bored."
Patrick says: "There's gotta be something we can do!"
Patrick says: "Almost there!"
SpongeBob says: "We're almost there!"
Patrick says: "We're almost there!"
Patrick says: "Here it is!"
SpongeBob says: "Ahhhhh!"
Patrick says: "Ohhhhh!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoooo!"
Patrick says: "Whoooo!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, we're here."
Patrick says: "But where's the toy store?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I guess it's not open yet."
Patrick says: "Not..."
Patrick says: "open?"
Patrick starts to cry. SpongeBob starts crying, too. They hug each other. A crane drops the new toy store onto the ground. A construction worker comes out of the crane.
Construction worker says: "What are you cryin' about?"
Patrick says: "We wanted to go to the toy store, but it's not open yet!"
Construction worker says: "Well, it's open now."
Construction worker says: "Look!"
Construction worker says: "See?"
Construction worker says: "Feel better now?"
Patrick says: "Mm-hm."
Construction worker says: "Then quit yer cryin' and get in there!"
SpongeBob says: "I got it."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, get up..."
Patrick says: "Uh, no thanks."
Patrick says: "I'm good down here."
SpongeBob says: "Look."
Patrick says: "Wow."
Steve the Cashier says: "Can I help you?"
SpongeBob says: "That depends."
SpongeBob says: "Tell me."
SpongeBob says: "Do you like to  sing?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Steve says: "Oh, no."
SpongeBob says: "Ahem!"
SpongeBob says: "♪La..."
Narrator says: "Several song-filled hours later..."
SpongeBob says: "♪Toys!"
SpongeBob says: "Glorious toys!"
SpongeBob says: "La, la, la!"
SpongeBob says: "Toys!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "♪ Hey, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "What’s with the tutu?"
SpongeBob says: "It's not a tutu!"
SpongeBob says: "It's a man-tu!"
SpongeBob says: "You can tell because it has  I got the last one."
Patrick says: "Uh-huh."
Fish says: "Aaahhhhhhhhh!"
SpongeBob says: "What a great day!"
SpongeBob says: "I hope it never ends!"
Patrick says: "Never!"
Voice on loudspeaker says: "Attention, shoppers, the store is now closed."
Voice on loudspeaker says: "Please exit immediately."
Baby says: "But I don't wanna go!"
Timmy says: "Ah!"
SpongeBob says: "Aw."
SpongeBob says: "The store's closing."
SpongeBob says: "We'll have to leave now."
Patrick says: "What part of "never" don't you understand?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, we have to leave."
Patrick says: "Huh!"
Patrick says: "I'm not moving."
SpongeBob says: "But they'll just come and kick us out!"
Patrick says: "Not if we hide."
SpongeBob says: "Hide?"
SpongeBob says: "Isn't that kind of sneaky?"
Patrick says: "Oh, it's sneaky alright."
Patrick says: "Really sneaky."
Patrick says: "C'mon, haven't you always wanted to have a toy store all to yourself?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "But I do now."
SpongeBob says: "What do we do first?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "We need to find a hiding spot where they'll never find us."
Patrick says: "And I know just the place."
Security guard says: "Come on, boy."
Security guard says: "Let's go."
Security guard says: "The store is empty, so go ahead and lock 'er up, Frank."
Steve says: "My name is Steve."
Security guard says: "Whatever floats your boat, Frank."
Patrick says: "The coast is clear."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, pal."
SpongeBob says: "Well, we did it."
SpongeBob says: "Yay!"
Patrick says: "Yay!"
Patrick says: "Oh, this is so awesome."
SpongeBob says: "Nothing can ruin it!"
The lights turn off. SpongeBob and Patrick run through the store while screaming. They eventually crash into each other.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, is that you?"
Patrick says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "I said Is that you?"
Patrick says: "I can't hear you!"
Patrick says: "It's too dark in here!"
Patrick says: "Don't worry."
Patrick says: "I'll just use my Night Vision."
SpongeBob says: "You have Night Vision?"
Patrick says: "Yeah."
SpongeBob says: "How long have you had that?"
Patrick says: "Remember that flashlight I shoved up my ear?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah."
Patrick says: "Well, I guess it worked its way into my brain."
SpongeBob says: "Calm down, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "We just need to find a light switch."
SpongeBob says: "But ya have to put me down first."
Patrick says: "Yeah."
Patrick says: "Right, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "I let you down, we find the light switch, and everything turns all peachy!"
SpongeBob says: "Yes."
Patrick says: "Look around you, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "We're surrounded!"
SpongeBob says: "By..."
SpongeBob says: "toys?"
Patrick says: "That..."
Patrick says: "want..."
Patrick says: "to..."
Patrick says: "get us."
SpongeBob says: "Eeeeeeee!"
SpongeBob says: "Aaahhhh!"
Patrick says: "Aaahhhh!"
SpongeBob and Patrick continue screaming, but they get onto some skates while they run. They start to laugh, but then they bump into balls, and fall off. The shadow continues to chase them, so they hide in a gumball machine.
Patrick says: "Are we gonna hide in here for the rest of our lives?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
Patrick says: "Are we going to the ladies’ room again?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "We're going to fight back and we are going to win!"
SpongeBob says: "."
Patrick says: "."
Patrick says: "That was fun!"
Patrick says: "Now let's dress up like fairy princesses!"
The shadow appears and is revealed to be the toy that Patrick had wound up earlier.
SpongeBob says: "Ready, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Let's get some!"
SpongeBob says: "It was nice knowin' ya, pal."
Patrick says: "I know."
Patrick says: "I'm an interesting guy."
The toy stops.
SpongeBob says: "Whew!"
Patrick says: "Whew!"
Patrick winds it up again.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, don't!"
Patrick says: "What?"
Steve says: "The Toy Barrel is now open for business."
Steve says: "Prepare for more fun than you've ever had."
SpongeBob says: "My eyes!"
Patrick says: "I love toys!"
