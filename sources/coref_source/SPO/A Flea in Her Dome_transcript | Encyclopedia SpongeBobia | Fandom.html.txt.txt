The camera zooms in on SpongeBob sitting crying in the area between his pineapple and Squidward's house. He lies down face-down and his tears send him up and down off the ground. He goes back to normal crying while sitting, he then bends his top half in towards his bottom half. Patrick walks up, picks SpongeBob up, and pats his back.
Patrick says: "There, there, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "No need to cry."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, there is, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Sandy's been gone for 2 whole days."
Patrick says: "2 whole days?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, why'd she have to go to that science convention in Tejas?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "Tejas!"
SpongeBob says: "She won't be back for 1 more hour, 26 minutes and 47 seconds!"
Patrick says: "Oh, 47 seconds!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, that's Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I sure do miss that squirrel."
SpongeBob says: "After Sandy gets back, we're gonna let her know just how much we miss her."
Patrick says: "Is Sandy the one I call Mom?"
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick, that's your mother."
SpongeBob says: "But that does give me an idea."
SpongeBob says: "We'll throw Sandy the mother of all welcome home parties!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, to the treedome!"
Patrick says: "Wa-hey!"
The scene changes to show Sandy's house. SpongeBob and Patrick sneak into it with party supplies. SpongeBob twirls the handle open and the two run in and start painting on a blue banner with light blue paint. SpongeBob writes from left to right, and Patrick does the opposite. They run out of space on the banner, and it reads "WELCOMANDY." Balloons rise up, transitioning to Patrick inhaling deeply. He holds an un-inflated balloon to his water helmet and tries to blow it up, failing. SpongeBob walks over, knocking on Patrick's Helmet to get his attention. He looks up at the tree. Patrick and SpongeBob jump out of the tree holding balloons. The balloons fill with air as the two float down. They stop, floating in mid-air just above the ground and start to kick their legs trying to reach it. There is another balloon transition to SpongeBob icing a cake which reads "WELCOME HOME SANDY!".
SpongeBob says: "Ah."
SpongeBob says: "Welcome home, Sandy, you know that we missed ya!"
Nat Peterson says: "No one wants to hear you sing!"
Sandy says: "Sorry, SpongeBob, he's got a fierce no-singing policy."
SpongeBob says: "That's quite alright, Miss Cheeks."
SpongeBob says: "As long you don't have a fierce no-partying policy!"
SpongeBob says: "First, cake, then we'll karate-chop, and then..."
Sandy says: "Throw a party."
SpongeBob says: "I knew it!"
SpongeBob says: "You have been itching to see us!"
Sandy says: "Well, something's making my skin crawl."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe a slice of cake will take your mind off of your crawling hide."
Patrick says: "This is gonna taste so good again."
SpongeBob says: "Dig in, Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh..."
Sandy says: "Looks..."
Sandy says: "Tasty, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Are you okay, Sandy?"
Sandy says: "I'm fine!"
Sandy says: "My skin just hasn't adjusted to this here underwater air."
SpongeBob says: "Uh.."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick and I chipped in and got ya a little somethin' somethin'."
Sandy says: "Aww, guys, you shouldn't have."
Sandy says: "A new itch board?"
Sandy says: "I mean, a new snowboard?"
Sandy says: "Boy, I sure can't wait to scratch this down chafe mountain."
SpongeBob says: "Don't you mean ride this down Scab Mountain?"
Sandy says: "Thank you very rawness, SpongeBob and Pat."
SpongeBob says: "Uh, you're welcome, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, uh, are you still up for some karate chops?"
Sandy says: "Rashy sore!"
Sandy says: "I mean, sure."
SpongeBob says: "And how 'bout now?"
SpongeBob says: "You ready?"
SpongeBob says: "What's a flea?"
Sandy says: "A flea is a dastardly little vermin that bites us air breathers."
Sandy says: "But this here flea collar will send the critter a-runnin'."
SpongeBob says: "He bit me!"
SpongeBob says: "Got any more of those fancy collars, Sandy?"
Sandy says: "No, but you can use this one right quick."
Patrick says: "Ow!"
Patrick says: "Ah, ooh, ow, ooh, ah, yah, aah!"
Patrick says: "Ouch!"
Patrick says: "Why does this flea keep biting me?"
Sandy says: "'Cause he's hungry."
Sandy says: "When a flea bites ya, it's 'cause he's sucking up your blood for nutrition."
Patrick says: "I've been bit by a vampire flea!"
Sandy says: "Patrick,  there ain't no such thing as vampires."
Sandy says: "Aah!"
Sandy says: "Gimme that!"
SpongeBob says: "Nyahh!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, please!"
SpongeBob says: "Help me!"
Sandy says: "I need this!"
SpongeBob says: "I need it more!"
Patrick says: "Eee!"
Sandy says: "Yah!"
Sandy says: "Looky, it worked!"
Sandy says: "Phew."
Sandy says: "I'm glad that's over."
SpongeBob says: "Um, is that what over looks like?"
Sandy says: "Tarnation!"
Sandy says: "They're multiplyin' like mad!"
Sandy says: "Run!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
Patrick says: "Okay!"
Patrick says: "Wah!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
Sandy says: "Hey!"
Sandy says: "Run again!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
Patrick says: "Okay!"
SpongeBob says: "Aah!"
Patrick says: "Mraah!"
Sandy says: "Aah!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, thanks for having us, Sandy, but we gotta go!"
Patrick says: "Yeah, good to see ya."
SpongeBob says: "Raah!"
Patrick says: "Raah!"
SpongeBob says: "Help!"
Patrick says: "Help!"
SpongeBob says: "Help!"
Patrick says: "Help!"
SpongeBob says: "Help!"
Patrick says: "Help!"
Squidward says: "Just ignore them, Squidward, and continue your power walk."
Squidward says: "Heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe."
Sandy says: "Back off!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, no!"
SpongeBob says: "Are you okay?"
Sandy says: "Them varmints is tough."
Sandy says: "They're from Texas, phew!"
Patrick says: "It's gonna be all right."
Patrick says: "And as for you!"
Patrick says: "If you hadn't thrown this party, we wouldn't be in this mess!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait a minute!"
SpongeBob says: "You had as much to do with this party as I did!"
Patrick says: "You call this a party?"
Patrick says: "I'm beginning to question  our friendship!"
SpongeBob says: "Stop smudging my helmet!"
Patrick says: "Oh, I've got half a mind, buddy!"
Sandy says: "What does that prove?!"
Sandy says: "!"
Sandy says: "If were gonna get out of this, we gotta work together."
Patrick says: "You're right."
Patrick says: "I have an idea."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, you get on Sandy's shoulders."
Patrick says: "Whoa!"
SpongeBob says: "Is this how we're gonna spend the rest of our lives?"
SpongeBob says: "Living in fleas instead of water?"
SpongeBob says: "Water!"
Patrick says: "Water!"
SpongeBob says: "It sure is good to have you back, Sandy!"
