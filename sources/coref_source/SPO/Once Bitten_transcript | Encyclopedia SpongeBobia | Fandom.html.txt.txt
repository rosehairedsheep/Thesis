SpongeBob says: "No, dirty boy."
SpongeBob says: "This isn't like you."
Squidward says: "Oh, but it's just like you, SpongeBob, to raise such a misbehaved mollusk."
SpongeBob says: "Gary's not misbehaved!"
SpongeBob says: "But there does appear to be something wrong with him."
Squidward says: "I'll say."
Squidward says: "I hope he had his shots."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, of course."
Squidward says: "All of his shots?"
SpongeBob says: "Affirmatory."
Squidward says: "For rabies?"

Patrick says: "Well, let's not forget the worst of them all: Mad Snail Disease."
SpongeBob says: "Uhh..."
Patrick says: "You mean your pet hasn't been vaccinated for mad snail disease?"
Patrick says: "Looks like the rash has already started."
Squidward says: "Rash?"
Patrick says: "Tell me, do you have any soreness of throat?"
Squidward says: "Well, now that you mention it, my throat is a little dry."
Patrick says: "This disease will ravage your body with bloodshot eyes, loss of balance, messy pants, ticklish rib cage, severely untrimmed toenails, and finally, the bite from that infected snail will turn you into..."
Patrick says: "A zombie."
SpongeBob says: "Gary?"
SpongeBob says: "Gary?!"

Johnny says: "mad snail disease."
Johnny says: "We now take you to Action News Reporter Perch Perkins live on the scene."
Perch Perkins says: "Perch Perkins here with the first victim of this epidemic."
Perch Perkins says: "Tell me, Mr."
Perch Perkins says: "Tentacles, when did you first begin to suspect that you were a zombie?"
Squidward says: "Well, after I was bitten by a mad snail, I began to get a rash; followed by loss of balance, ticklish rib cage, and a few other symptoms."
Frank says: "Whoa."
Perch Perkins says: "Hey, I have a ticklish rib cage, too."
Perch Perkins says: "And I haven't even been bitten."

Mr. Krabs says: "And bring your friends in, too."
Mr. Krabs says: "They look hungry."
Frank says: "Stop!"
Frank says: "You can't let anyone in!"
Mr. Krabs says: "But they just want to dine on some Krabby Patties."
Frank says: "They're zombies."
Frank says: "They only want to dine on our flesh."
Mr. Krabs says: "Arrgh, alright, but it's coming out of your paycheck."
Frank says: "I don't work here."
SpongeBob says: "But, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, it's me, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "But how do we know you haven't become one of those voracious flesh-eaters?"
SpongeBob says: "Could a voracious flesh-eater do this?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, it's you."
SpongeBob says: "That's right."
SpongeBob says: "So let me in before I'm eaten."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, that's SpongeBob all right."
Patrick says: "Or is it?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
Patrick says: "I don't believe that's the real SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "He looks pretty zombified."
Patrick says: "Just look at how yellow he is."
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Patrick, would a zombie have a picture of his best buddy in his wallet?"
Patrick says: "Perhaps not, but I got my eye on you!"
Old Man Jenkins says: "If you could pull out your eye and put it on him, wouldn't that make..."
Old Man Jenkins says: "You a zombie too?"

SpongeBob says: "But I know you're just a snail."
SpongeBob says: "How could you?"
Harold says: "SpongeBob's been infected by his own pet snail."
Harold says: "Oh, the irony!"
Harold says: "Quick, we must quarantine that infected snail before he bites every last Bikini Bottomite."
Harold says: "Let's get the snail!"
All says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't hurt him!"
Harold says: "Hand over the snail!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's..."
Mr. Krabs says: "for his own good, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "I won't let you touch Gary!"
Harold says: "Stop the madness, man!"
Harold says: "The Mad Snail Disease ends now!"
Harold says: "Seize the snail!"
Doctor Gill Gilliam says: "Halt!"
Doctor Gill Gilliam says: "Did someone say 'Mad Snail Disease'?"

Doctor Gill Gilliam says: "No such thing."
Doctor Gill Gilliam says: "It's an old urban legend."
Doctor Gill Gilliam says: "A myth."
Patrick says: "Well, does that mean we're not zombies?"
Doctor Gill Gilliam says: "Of course not."
Doctor Gill Gilliam says: "No one is."
Doctor Gill Gilliam says: "It's just mass hysteria."
Nathiel says: "But what about my severely untrimmed..."
Doctor Gill Gilliam says: "Those are only moderately untrimmed."
Doctor Gill Gilliam says: "All the supposed symptoms are just common ailments."
SpongeBob says: "Easy, boy."
SpongeBob says: "But what about Gary then?"
SpongeBob says: "If he doesn't have a disease, why'd he bite all those people, including me?"
Doctor Gill Gilliam says: "Hmmm..."
Doctor Gill Gilliam says: "mm-hmm."
Doctor Gill Gilliam says: "Ahh!"
Doctor Gill Gilliam says: "The problem's right here."
Doctor Gill Gilliam says: "He's got a little splinter in his foot."
Doctor Gill Gilliam says: "I'm sure this was the cause of his distemper making for serious grouchy snailitis."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Gary, I knew you weren't disease-ridden."
SpongeBob says: "You still love me?"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Good ol' Gary's back."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "You're not a zombie, remember?"
