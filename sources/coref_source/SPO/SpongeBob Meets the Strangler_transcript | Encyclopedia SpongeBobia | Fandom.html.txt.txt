Officer Johnson says: "Yeah."
Officer Johnson says: "We got him chained up real good."
Officer Johnson says: "He'll never get away."
Officer Nancy says: "Oops, not again."

SpongeBob says: "I need a bodyguard!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I wasn't five-time 'Golden Claws' in the navy for nothin'."
Mr. Krabs says: "When he sees me moves, he'll be running scared."
Mr. Krabs says: "So, where is this little bully?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Down at the park?"
Mr. Krabs says: "The sodey shop?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What does he look like, eh, boy?"
SpongeBob says: "This would be him, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Strangler says: "Bodyguard, huh?"
Strangler says: "I might be able to help you out."
SpongeBob says: "You don't understand, mister."
SpongeBob says: "I need protection from the scariest guy in town."
SpongeBob says: "Here's his picture."
Strangler says: "Heh heh, he doesn't look so tough."
SpongeBob says: "I tattled on him, and now he wants to strangle me with his diabolical hands!"
SpongeBob says: "I hope they're not dirty."
Strangler says: "Huh?"
Strangler says: "Uh-oh."
Strangler says: "Uh, there's too many witnesses around here."
SpongeBob says: "Hmm, looks good to me."
SpongeBob says: "You're hired!"
SpongeBob says: "I feel safer already."
SpongeBob says: "What's next?"
Strangler says: "Well, the maniac could be anywhere, wearing a disguise."
Strangler says: "He could be that old man."
SpongeBob says: "Or that pebble."
Strangler says: "Huh?"
Strangler says: "Uhh, that's mine."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands."
SpongeBob says: "What do we do first?"
Strangler says: "Well, I suggest we go to a nice, quiet, secluded location, uh, like behind an old dumpster or a dark alley..."
SpongeBob says: "We could go to my house and turn off all the lights!"
Strangler says: "Perfect."
Strangler says: "That way no one can hear you being strangled..."
Strangler says: "err, I mean, uhh, protected."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, excellent."
SpongeBob says: "Ah, but first, I gotta do a few errands."
Strangler says: "Uhh, okay, but let's make it quick."
SpongeBob says: "Quick is my middle name."
SpongeBob says: "Let's see..."

SpongeBob says: "I'll take both!"
Dry Cleaner says: "Here you go, Mr."
Dry Cleaner says: "SquarePants."
SpongeBob says: "Hmm."
Dry Cleaner says: "Is there something wrong?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm not sure if these are my pants."
SpongeBob says: "How about this one, bodyguard?"
SpongeBob says: "Too overbearing?"
Strangler says: "Can we just go to your house?!"
Strangler says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Here we are."
SpongeBob says: "SquarePants Manor."
SpongeBob says: "Bodyguard, let me just take this opportunity to say you're the best bodyguard a fella could hope to have."
Strangler says: "All right, enough of the sappy talk!"
Strangler says: "Open the door so I can strangle you..."
Strangler says: "I mean, uhh, choke you..."
Strangler says: "I mean, uhh, crush your windpipe..."
Strangler says: "gah, I mean..."
SpongeBob says: "Protect me?"
Strangler says: "Thanks."
SpongeBob says: "Don't mention it, Strangler."
Narrator says: "Twenty minutes later..."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I can't find 'em."
SpongeBob says: "You wanna take a look?"
Strangler says: "Oh, forget the key!"
Strangler says: "Let's climb through this window."
SpongeBob says: "Sure."
SpongeBob says: "With these spiky cleats, anything is possible."
SpongeBob says: "Ya."
Strangler says: "Cleats?!"
Strangler says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas!"
Narrator says: "Six hours later..."
SpongeBob says: "Don't be mad, bodyguard."
SpongeBob says: "Let me just grab the key I keep under the mat and we can get inside."
SpongeBob says: "Step inside..."
Strangler says: "Close the door..."
SpongeBob says: "Well, here we are."
Strangler says: "I've finally got you all alone!"
SpongeBob says: "I know, isn't it great?"

SpongeBob says: "Bye Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, bye Plankton, bye Sandy, bye Larry, bye Pearl, bye Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff, bye Squidward, bye, eh, the rest."
SpongeBob says: "Ahh, alone at last."

SpongeBob says: "How did you guys know today is my birthday?"
Patrick says: "We just do what the invitations say."
Patrick says: "Let's boogie some more!"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for coming!"

Strangler says: "Is it true?"
Strangler says: "Everybody's gone?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh-huh."
Strangler says: "No, no more parties today?"
Strangler says: "You got everything you need now?"
Strangler says: "Nobody's left?"
Strangler says: "We're completely alone?"

Strangler says: "Oh..."
Strangler says: "sorry, Tubby, you've gotta go."
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "We can trust Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "He's my best friend."
Strangler says: "Well, I can't take any chances."
Strangler says: "For all we know, he could be the Strangler."
Patrick says: "I'm the Strangler?"
Patrick says: "Oh, I should've known!"
Patrick says: "I gotta turn myself in!"
SpongeBob says: "So, Patrick's the Strangler."
SpongeBob says: "Gee, you think you know a guy."
Strangler says: "He's not the Strangler!"
SpongeBob says: "He's not?"
Strangler says: "I am!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, how'd you do that without shaving cream?"
Strangler says: "Oh, it's a fake, you idiot!"
Strangler says: "I bought it at the party store!"
Squidward says: "Did someone say "party"?"
Strangler says: "I can't take it!"
Strangler says: "Step on it!"
Strangler says: "I'm being chased by a maniac!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm not safe!"
SpongeBob says: "Come back!"
Strangler says: "Finally, away from that guy."
SpongeBob says: "Bodyguard, bodyguard!"
Strangler says: "Look, kid..."
Strangler says: "I'm not your bodyguard!"
Officer Nancy says: "Good work, SpongeBob."
Officer Nancy says: "You put the Strangler behind bars."
Strangler says: "At least I'm safe from that yellow idiot."
Patrick says: "Hey, Mac,  what're you in for?"
