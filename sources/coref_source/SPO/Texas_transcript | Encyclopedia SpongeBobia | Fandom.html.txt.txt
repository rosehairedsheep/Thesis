Sandy starts to laugh and tears of laughter spew out and fill her helmet. Everyone frowns as tears start to well up in SpongeBob and Patrick's eyes.
SpongeBob says: "Don't cry anymore, Sandy, I'll go get your bags."
Sandy says: "Huh?"
Sandy says: "Duh."
Sandy says: "What am I doing?"
Sandy says: "I was home all along, and it took me until now to realize it."
SpongeBob says: "Does that mean you'll stay?"
