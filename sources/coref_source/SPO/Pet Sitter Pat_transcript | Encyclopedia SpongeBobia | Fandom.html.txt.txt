The episode begins when the postman posts letters for SpongeBob under his door.
Grandma's voice says: "Dear SpongeBob, won't you come join me for my birthday?"
Grandma's voice says: "I'll be turning..."
Grandma's voice says: "even older this year!"
Grandma's voice says: "With love, Grandma."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Grandma's turning even older!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't wait to celebrate!"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Gary, I am gonna miss you when I'm gone..."
SpongeBob says: "but, if I'm not here, who's going to take care of you?"
Squidward says: "Hmhmhmhm..."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Oh, no."
Squidward says: "No way!"
Squidward says: "Look what that disgusting pest did to my sustainable kelp garden!"
Squidward says: "He chewed it up, ruined it!"
SpongeBob says: "Gary, is that true?"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I'll see you later, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what are you doing?"
Patrick says: "I'm talking to my friend, Funny."
Patrick says: "Hi, Funny!"
SpongeBob says: "Heh, yeah."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick, I need to ask a favor of you."
Patrick says: "What is it?"
SpongeBob says: "IÂ need you to take care of Gary."
Patrick says: "Are you going off the grid?"
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Patrick says: "Don't worry, I know what I do."
Patrick says: "You're gonna need one of these."
SpongeBob says: "No, that's not it!"
SpongeBob says: "I am going to see my Grandma for her birthday, and I'm trusting my best pal to watch carefully over Gary when I'm gone."
Patrick says: "You got it."
Patrick says: "He's safe with me!"
Gary says: "Meow!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "There you are!"
Patrick says: "What's that?"
SpongeBob says: "It's a chronological list of all the things you need to do with Gary."
SpongeBob says: "Make sure you do each and every one."
Patrick says: "Got it!"
Patrick says: "Hey, do you have any more of those deep fried cream filled sugar-coated coral balls?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah."
SpongeBob says: "They're in the cupboard."
Patrick says: "Ooh, coral balls."
SpongeBob says: "I'm gonna miss you, little guy."
SpongeBob says: "But I know you are going to be in good hands."
Patrick says: "Don't you trust me?"
Patrick says: "I am the most responsible guy you know!"
SpongeBob says: "You know what?"
SpongeBob says: "You're right."
Patrick says: "Well, of course I am!"
Patrick says: "Yep!"
Patrick says: "Looks like it's just you and me, friend."
Gary says: "Meow."
Patrick says: "Hmmm..."
Patrick says: "I wonder what we should do first."
Gary says: "Meow."
Patrick says: "Oh hey Fred!"
Patrick says: "What's up?"
Gary says: "Meow."
Patrick says: "Step aside, Barry."
Patrick says: "Let me show you how it's done."
Patrick says: "Good stuff."
Patrick says: "I wonder what SpongeBob's got for you in the fridge."
Meanwhile, at SpongeBob's Grandma's house...
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Grandma, you shouldn't have."
SpongeBob says: "It's your birthday, I should be serving you!"
Grandma says: "Awww..."
Grandma says: "I know how much you love sweets, and I know how much you love your pet snail, so I made you this special gelatin mold."
SpongeBob says: "Gary."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Gary."
Patrick says: "He's safe with me."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Grandma, can I please use your phone?"
Grandma says: "Of course!"
SpongeBob says: "Thank you."
Patrick says: "Hello?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, it's SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "How's Gary?"
Patrick says: "Oh, Gary!"
Patrick says: "Yeah, he's fine."
Patrick says: "Snail food!"
Gary says: "Meow!"
Patrick says: "SquarePants household."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, Patrick, about Gary's bath, make sure the bath water is not too hot, and he doesn't like too many bubbles."
Patrick says: "Yeah, yeah."
SpongeBob says: "And remember to dry him off really good."
Patrick says: "All right."
SpongeBob says: "And don't forget about the list!"
Gary says: "Meow!"
Patrick says: "Doesn't that look fun?"
Patrick says: "Well, make up your mind!"
Patrick says: "Is it water or fire?"
Gary says: "Meow!"
Patrick says: "That wasn't so bad, now was it?"
Gary says: "Oww!"
Patrick says: "Sheesh, Gary!"
Patrick says: "Well, if you wanted another bath, why didn't you just ask?"
Meanwhile, back at SpongeBob's grandma's house...
Grandma says: "Oh, dear!"
Grandma says: "Look at all those candles!"
Grandma says: "Why, if I were any older, we'd be in danger of burning down the house!"
SpongeBob says: "Grandma, can I use your phone again?"
Grandma says: "Go ahead, dear."
Grandma says: "But there may not be any cake left when you get back!"
Patrick says: "SquareyPants' house."
SpongeBob says: "Just checking, is everything okay over there?"
Patrick says: "Who is this?"
SpongeBob says: "It's SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Is Gary all right?"
Patrick says: "Oh, yeah."
SpongeBob says: "Grandma!"
SpongeBob says: "Grandma!"
Grandma says: "Hold on, dear."
Grandma says: "Oh, but oh, am I tired!"
Grandma says: "What a good boy!"
SpongeBob says: "Ahh..."
SpongeBob says: "reading Patrick a bedtime story, I see."
SpongeBob says: ""Snail Tales," that's a good one."
Patrick says: ""Snail Tales"?"
Patrick says: "I thought it was called, "Meow, meow, meow."
