SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Squidward, I got a little distracted."
SpongeBob says: "I'm practicing for my oral report for Boating School tomorrow."
Squidward says: "You know, SpongeBob, statistics show that public speaking is the number three cause of stress right behind death and marriage."
Squidward says: "Now get those orders ready!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
SpongeBob says: "Hm, what's so scary about public speaking anyway?"
SpongeBob says: "You just stand in front of the public and speak publicly."
SpongeBob says: "It's really no different to what I do everyday."
Scene cuts to SpongeBob coming out of the kitchen with a Krabby Patty and gets shocked. We see a bunch of fish looking like zombies.
SpongeBob says: "No big deal, SpongeBob, you just stand in front of them..."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward is right!"
SpongeBob says: "Public speaking is frightening!"
SpongeBob says: "I never knew an audience can get so physical."
Patrick says: "Oh, sorry, wrong rock."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I wonder if you'd help me by lending me your eyes."
Patrick says: "Okay."
Patrick says: "Uhhh..."
SpongeBob says: "No, no, no, no, no, you can keep them."
SpongeBob says: "I just want you to watch me while I practice my speech up here."
SpongeBob says: "Just pretend you're a student at his desk."
Patrick says: "Okay."
Patrick says: "H-Hold on, I'd like to sit in the back of the class."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, here goes."
SpongeBob says: "Boating safety is..."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, can I have a hall pass?"
SpongeBob says: "Not now, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Just sit tight and let me practice."
Patrick says: "Fine."
SpongeBob says: "Boating safe..."
Patrick says: "Boring!"
Patrick says: "Next!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you're kinda derailing the proceedings here."
SpongeBob says: "Just focus on me, huh?"
Patrick says: "All right, all right."
SpongeBob says: "So, without further ado..."
SpongeBob says: "What happened, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Oh, come on, SpongeBob, you think everyone can stay awake through a boring speech?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know."
SpongeBob says: "Do you think that's too much to expect?"
Patrick says: "Yes!"
Patrick says: "And you should be prepared for worse."
SpongeBob says: "Worse?"
Patrick says: "You're gonna have things thrown at you that you wouldn't believe."
Patrick says: "You gotta be ready."
Patrick says: "Now try again."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
Patrick says: "That's it!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, nobody throws pillows in class!"
Patrick says: "Says you!"
Patrick says: "Speech!"
SpongeBob says: "Boating safe..."
Patrick walks up to him dressed up like Mrs. Puff.
Patrick says: "SpongeBob SquarePants, what a mess you've made of my classroom."
SpongeBob says: "Uh, you sorta add a hand in that, too, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "What, a detention slip?"
Patrick says: "I'm not hearing your oral report."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
Patrick says: "Try again."
Patrick says: "Come on, SquarePants!"
Patrick says: "Is this the best you can do?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, somehow I don't think this is working."
Patrick says: "Speech!"
Patrick says: "Speech!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, stop!"
SpongeBob says: "Somehow your help just isn't helping."
SpongeBob says: "I am more nervous about this oral report than I've ever been about anything."
Patrick says: "Yeah, you do look pretty terrible."
SpongeBob says: "Well, if I don't do my report, then I don't pass."
SpongeBob says: "And if I don't pass, then I don't get my boating license!"
Patrick says: "Wait, buddy!"
Patrick says: "I know how you can get your boating license."
Patrick says: "Your friend the squirrel girl is real good with her paws."
Patrick says: "Maybe she can make you a fake one."
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick, that's illegal, but she might be able to help me get over this anxiety."
SpongeBob says: "She's always speaking at science conferences."
SpongeBob says: "She's probably full of pointers!"
Patrick says: "Yeah, or she probably has a robot that can demolish the whole school for ya."
Sandy says: "Hmm..."
Sandy says: "White knuckles, leaky pores, and stomach in knots."
Sandy says: "Y-y-yep."
Sandy says: "He does look pretty bad."
Sandy says: "SpongeBob, you're afflicted with severe oral report-itis."
Sandy says: "You know, patients with this disease have been known to physically explode."
Sandy says: "Ker-pow!"
Sandy says: "It has been scientifically proven that  85% of speech related stress can be eliminated if the speaker imagines the audience in their underwear."
SpongeBob's hand take the clothes off the person and he covers his underwear. He tears the page to cover his underwear.
Sandy says: "Everyone will look so silly, you won't even remember you're nervous!"
Sandy says: "Which is why I invented these."
Sandy says: "Goggles that let you see people in your undies."
Sandy says: "Or, I could just make you a fake boating license."
SpongeBob says: "That's still illegal."
SpongeBob says: "Give me the goggles!"
SpongeBob says: "It's not working."
Sandy says: "Well, of course it isn't, silly!"
Sandy says: "I'm only wearing my undies."
Sandy says: "See if it works on Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Eh!"
SpongeBob says: "Ooh, they work."
Scene bubbles over to Mrs. Puff's Boating School.

Mrs. Puff says: "Well, SpongeBob?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Do you have your oral report ready?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh..."
SpongeBob says: "?"
Mrs. Puff says: "The assignment I gave you."
Mrs. Puff says: "The one where you talk in front of the class."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Of course I'm ready!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, no."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, no!"
Mrs. Puff says: "What are you doing?!"
Mrs. Puff says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff, do I really have to do this?"
Mrs. Puff says: "No."
Mrs. Puff says: "Only if you want to pass this class!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, where are those goggles?"
Patrick says: "Right here."

Mrs. Puff says: "You can't take my boat!"
Mrs. Puff says: "SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Wait, SpongeBob!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Get back here with my boat!"
Police Officer says: "I don't know, slow day at the office, huh?"
Police Officer #2 says: "You said it, partner!"
Police Officer #2 says: "My baton's itching for the noggin of a lawbreaker."
Police Officer says: "Okay, forget what I just said."
Police Officer says: "Sponge, pull over!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know how!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob breaks through three houses, smashes into the next one and goes flying and lands on his head.
Police Officer says: "All right, kid, what was that all about?"
Police Officer #2 says: "Don't you know anything about boating safety?"
SpongeBob says: "Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the whole ocean."
SpongeBob says: "Each boater must follow the rules and regulations stipulated in the boater safety handbook."
SpongeBob says: "When the meaning of all important signs..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "pay attention to all surroundings..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "when wet means no parking..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "it already figures..."

Police Officer says: "I never even knew some of those things myself."
Mrs. Puff says: "Aha!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Finally!"
Mrs. Puff says: "The long arm of the laws caught up with you!"
Mrs. Puff says: "I guess I won't be seeing you in my driver's education class for the next 5 to 10 years!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
Police Officer says: "Wait, wait, Miss Chuckles, did you say you were his boating instructor?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Yes."
Mrs. Puff says: "Why?"
SpongeBob says: "--"for any minor delinquent actions under that teacher's care"."
Police Officer says: "Unquote."
Police Officer says: "I'm afraid we're gonna have to take you in, ma'am."
Mrs. Puff says: "What?!"
Mrs. Puff says: "!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Nooo!"
Patrick says: "Hey, buddy, you got over your fear of getting an oral talking thing."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, I did!"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, pal!"
Patrick says: "Oh, that reminds me."
Scary Face says: "And, what are you lookin' at?"
