The title card has men singing part of the song "Sailing Over the Dogger Bank" ♪Watcha twigger she's a proper jubby-jewel... On a passage from the Dogger Bank to Great Grimsby!♪ then we see the Krusty Krab at night.
Mr. Krabs says: "Closing time!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, see you in the A."
SpongeBob says: "M."
SpongeBob says: ", Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hold on there, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, you shouldn't talk about Squidward like that!"
Squidward says: "He means this filth, you loon!"
SpongeBob goes to the dumpster while bringing the trash bag.
SpongeBob says: "Takin' out the trash, takin' out the trash."
SpongeBob throws the trash in the dumpster and then looks at some writings on the dumpster.
SpongeBob says: "Hmm..."
SpongeBob says: "dumpster writing!"
SpongeBob says: "The voice of the people!"
SpongeBob says: ""Up with bubbles, down with air!"
SpongeBob says: ""."
Garbage man says: "Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, sometimes, but not..."
SpongeBob says: "Recently."
Patrick says: "Hi, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick, do you know what this word means?"
Patrick says: ""Krabs..."
Patrick says: "" Uh, isn't that the red, sweaty guy you work for?"
SpongeBob says: "Nah-uh, not that word, that word."
Patrick says: "Hmm..."
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "Oh, hey!"
Patrick says: "I think I know what that means."
Patrick says: "That's one of those sentence enhancers."
SpongeBob says: "Sentence enhancers?"
Patrick says: "You use them when you want to talk fancy."
Patrick says: "You just sprinkle it over anything you say, and Wham-O!"
Patrick says: "You've got yourself a spicy sentence sandwich!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I get it!"
SpongeBob says: "Let me try."
SpongeBob says: "day we're having, isn't it?"
Patrick says: "Why, yes it is, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "This  lovely!"
SpongeBob says: "How  right you are, Patrick!"
The two continue to say the word a few more times.
SpongeBob says: "Ooh, You're right, Patrick, my lips are tingling from the spiciness of this conversation."
Patrick says: "Oh, mine, too!"
SpongeBob says: "It tingles when I laugh!"
SpongeBob walks into the Krusty Krab the next day.
Harold says: "Did he just say?!"
Harold says: "!"
Pirate fish says: "Aye, he did."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick, how the  are ya?"
Patrick says: "good, SpongeBob."
Old Man Jenkins says: "I thought this was a restaurant, not a gutter mouth convention."
SpongeBob says: "are ya?"
Patrick says: "Nice  day, isn't it, Squidward?"
Tom says: "I don't understand."
Tom says: "That guy's talented, he doesn't have to work blue."
Evelyn says: "Let's go somewhere more family oriented."
Female fish says: "I'm never eating here again."
Male fish says: "Those foul-mouth bottom feeders."
The Krusty Krab customer meter is running down; sirens wail and a red light flashes.
Mr. Krabs says: "All hands on deck!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Batten the front doors!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Brace the cash register!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Break out the happy snacks!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward, where have all me beautiful paying customers gone?"
Squidward says: "Apparently, the two barnacle-mouth brothers just learned a new word, and SpongeBob just said it over the intercom."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, what was it?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What'd he say?"
Squidward says: "Er..."
Squidward says: "he said..."
Squidward says: "um, well he said..."
Squidward whispers.
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob and friend!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Front and center!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why, I oughta make the two of you paint the Krusty Krab for using such language!"
SpongeBob says: "But, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, we were only using our sentence enhancers."
Patrick says: "Yeah, it's fancy talk."
Mr. Krabs says: "There ain't nothing fancy about that word!"
SpongeBob says: "You mean?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes, that one!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's a bad word!"
SpongeBob says: "Bad word?!"
Patrick says: "Bad word?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes sirree, that's bad word number 11."
Mr. Krabs says: "In fact, there are 13 bad words you should never use."
Squidward says: "Don't you mean there are only seven?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Not if you're a sailor."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, 13."
Patrick says: "That's a lot of  bad words."
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, boys."
Mr. Krabs says: "I want you to promise me you'll never use that word again."
SpongeBob says: "We promise."
Patrick says: "We promise."
SpongeBob says: "Gee, I'm glad Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs told us that word we were using was a bad word!"
Patrick says: "Yeah, me too, because classy sophisticates like us shouldn't stain our lips with cursing."
SpongeBob says: "Yea, verily."
SpongeBob says: "Now, let's play a nice, wholesome game of Eels and Escalators."
Patrick says: "Oh, boy, my favorite!"
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Gary needs a new pair of shoes!"
Patrick says: "Oh, eels."
Patrick says: "Too bad, SpongeBob, you gotta ride the eel."
SpongeBob says: "Darn."
Patrick says: "My turn!"
Patrick says: "Up, up, up!"
SpongeBob says: "Come on, escalators, escalators, escalators."
SpongeBob says: "Eels again."
Patrick says: "My turn!"
Patrick says: "Escalators!"
SpongeBob says: "Escalators, Escalators, Escalators!"
SpongeBob says: "Eels?"
Patrick says: "Well, this is your last chance, SpongeBob, or if you get eels again, you lose!"
Patrick says: "Eels..."
Patrick says: "Ooooh..."
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "You said number 11!"
SpongeBob says: "I didn't mean..."
SpongeBob says: "you gotta understand, Patrick, I was trying..."
SpongeBob says: "what I meant to say was..."
SpongeBob says: "some things just slip out."
SpongeBob says: "You gotta understand!"
Patrick says: "Don't worry, SpongeBob, I understand."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, no, please don't tell!"
SpongeBob says: "Aha!"
SpongeBob says: "Now I'm gonna tell Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs on you!"
Patrick says: "Not if I tell first!"
SpongeBob says: "I can run faster than you!"
Patrick says: "Oh, nooooo!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What, what, what?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, Patrick, Patrick!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes, yes, yes?"
SpongeBob says: "He said, he said, he said!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Out with it, boy!"
SpongeBob says: "Me and Patrick were playing Eels and Escalators, and Patrick was going up-up-up, and I had to ride the eel and then we ran and Patrick, he said some things."
Mr. Krabs says: "What kind of things?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, he said..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, uh, let's just say he said a certain word that you said we shouldn't say, and this particular word happens to be number 11 in a list of 13 words you said shouldn't be said."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "right, now what was that part about the, um..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Who now?"
SpongeBob says: "He said that word that you said we shouldn't say..."
Patrick says: "He said that word that you said we shouldn't say..."
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "number thirteen..."
They babble on about the word, as Mr. Krabs stares on disapprovingly, until the two are just pointing at each other and yelling gibberish; Mr. Krabs eventually grabs their lips to quiet them.
SpongeBob says: "Mmm-mmm..."
Patrick says: "Mmm-mmm..."
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now I'm gonna let go of yer lips, and when I do, I want you to calmly tell me what youse need to tell me, understand?"
SpongeBob says: "Mmm-hmm..."
Patrick says: "Mmm-hmm..."
SpongeBob says: ""!"
Patrick says: ""!"
Patrick says: "What's going to happen to us?"
SpongeBob says: "We'll probably get 40 lashes!"
Patrick says: "Oh, no!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs was right."
SpongeBob says: "There's no need for words like that."
Patrick says: "I'm sorry, too, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Let's make a vow, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "From this day forth, a foul word shall never pass our lips!"
SpongeBob says: "We'll be good citizens, just like good ol' Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Patrick says: "Agreed!"
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, you two foul mouths."
Mr. Krabs says: "As punishment for fouling the air in me restaurant with yer foul words, you're going to give the Krusty Krab a fresh coat of paint from top to bottom."
SpongeBob says: "Five, six, seven..."
Mr. Krabs says: "..."
Mr. Krabs says: "a whole lotta..."
Patrick says: "Nine..."
SpongeBob says: "We're gonna tell your mom, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait, please don't tell me mother!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't think her little old heart can take it!"
They go to the house.
SpongeBob says: "Mama Krabs, Mama Krabs!"
Patrick says: "Mama Krabs, Mama Krabs!"
Mama Krabs says: "Why, hello there!"
SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs all explain the situation at the same time, swearing numerous times as they do so.
SpongeBob says: "Mama Krabs, he said!"
Patrick says: "It was terrible."
Mr. Krabs says: "LIARS!!"
SpongeBob says: "--Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, he didn't care!"
Patrick says: "It was terrible!"
SpongeBob says: "--I have never heard in my days!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You two should be ashamed!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Making an old lady faint with your sailor talk!"
Mama Krabs says: "You should all be ashamed."
Mama Krabs says: "And if you're going to talk like sailors, then you're going to work like sailors."
Then the three are painting her house; Patrick is painting the sand.
Mama Krabs says: "I guess you scallywags have earned a glass of lemonade."
Mama Krabs says: "foot!"
SpongeBob and Patrick gasp in shock.
Mr. Krabs says: "Mother!"
Mama Krabs says: "What?"
Mama Krabs says: "It's Old Man Jenkins and his jalopy."
