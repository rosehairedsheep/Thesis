At a roofed wrestling stadium. Stage lights move around outside.
Perch Perkins says: "Perch Perkins here and coming to you live from the Bikini Bottom Wrestling Royal Rumble Free for All."
Mr. Krabs says: "Free?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Gimme, gimme, gimme!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uhh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "what do I get?"
Perch Perkins says: "Well, what you get is the most anticipated event of the wrestling season!"
One punches the other one in the stomach repeatedly and other one rips the other champ in half using his knee and crowd is shocked.
Wrestler #1 gets up, looking unharmed.
Perch Perkins says: "Anyone who can defeat these giants will earn the championship title."
Mr. Krabs says: "Big deal."
Perch Perkins says: "And the million dollar cash prize."
The wrestlers are next to a green bag with a dollar sign on it. Wrestler #2 has his foot on it.
Mr. Krabs says: "Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!"
The fight bell rings and a man detaches the red rope holding the line of contestants back only to get stomped on as they run towards the arena.
Mr. Krabs says: "Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Money, money..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Money?"
A medical crew comes and takes out the people in a ball.
Mr. Krabs says: "Ohhhhhh."
A pile of contestants is on the ring floor.
Contestant says: "My leg!"
Contestant says: "My leg."
A janitor sweeps the pile from the ring.
Mr. Krabs says: "No living soul should have to suffer through what I've witnessed here today."
Mr. Krabs says: "Except maybe..."
Later, SpongeBob and Patrick run to the stage blindfolded and excited and they both laugh. Mr. Krabs guides them with a leash.
SpongeBob says: "Where are you taking us, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs releases the leash.
Mr. Krabs says: "Now go get them!"
SpongeBob says: "What do you think the surprise is, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "I don't know."
Patrick says: "What do you think it is?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know."
SpongeBob says: "What do you..."
SpongeBob says: "Ohhh."
SpongeBob says: "Whatever it is, it's really big."
Patrick says: "And hairy."
Wrestler #2 picks up and breathes on SpongeBob who coughs every time he gets blown on.
SpongeBob says: "And it smells angry."
Patrick says: "Is it time to look yet?"
SpongeBob says: "You peek first."
Patrick says: "No, you peek first."
Wrestler #2 squeezes SpongeBob until his eyeballs pop out and see the wrestlers and Wrestler #1 does same to Patrick.Both of them scream and get out of the wrestlers' hands and run behind Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob says: "Hey, who are those guys, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "They look like they wanna hurt us."
Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Those two?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ah, they're harmless."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's all just part of the act."
SpongeBob says: "The act?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Of course."
Mr. Krabs says: "They're just pretending."
Patrick says: "Pretending?"
SpongeBob says: "We like pretending."
Patrick says: "We like pretending."
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't we all?"
Patrick says: "Can we wear costumes?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Eh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "sure."
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob, how do I look?"
SpongeBob says: "Wow."
SpongeBob says: "Looks like those Iron Bun workout videos are really paying off."

Woman on Exercising Video says: "And 2, and 3, and 4 steps closer to your dream body."
Cut to Patrick sleeping and still doing the exercise.
Patrick says: "I can even do it in my sleep."
Scene cuts back to the wrestling arena.
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "Can we have cool nicknames too?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ohh, fine."
SpongeBob says: "And together we are..."
Mr. Krabs says: "The Krusty Krushers."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now go out there and wrestle me up a million dollars!"
They both fly into the ropes because of the force of Mr. Krabs' yell and bounce off and laugh.
SpongeBob says: "This is going to be so fun."

SpongeBob says: "Actually, we're here to fake wrestle."
Patrick says: "And to pretend wrestle."
Announcer says: "Whatever."
Announcer says: "In this corner we have the challengers, the Krusty Krushers!"
They both pull out a Krabby Patty and they chew it like they're tough. SpongeBob burps after he bites his. The crowd is cheering.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, excuse me."
Mr. Krabs says: "You can do it!"
Announcer says: "And on the opposite side of the ring, we have the undefeated champions."
Wrestler #1 lifts up a barbell then Wrestler #2 crushes the barbell with his bare hands and puts it in a Krabby Patty and eats it then burps in Wrestler #1's face until his skin rips off as the crowd boos.
SpongeBob says: "Happy thoughts, happy thoughts, happy thoughts..."
Patrick says: "Happy thoughts, happy thoughts, happy thoughts..."
SpongeBob says: "Did it just get dark in here?"
Patrick says: "Dark?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "I'm afraid of the dark."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, don't be afraid."
SpongeBob says: "It's just them."
Patrick says: "Oh, right, it's just those guys we're gonna wrestle."
Patrick says: "What was that?"
SpongeBob says: "That's Wrestlese for "You're dead meat."
Patrick says: "I don't get it."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, look, Patrick, it's Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs cheering us on."
They crash into Wrestler #2 then SpongeBob falls into a bucket.
SpongeBob says: "Whoa."
Patrick also lands into the bucket on top of SpongeBob.
Patrick says: "Oh, hey, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Look, Patrick,  it's a fist."
Patrick says: "A fist?"
Patrick says: "Where?"
Patrick says: "Oh, yeah, that's definitely a..."
They both get punched more and more until they turn to liquid. Wrestler #1 gargles SpongeBob and Patrick and spits them out into the drain. The crowd groans as they slosh down the drain. An impatient Mr. Krabs uses a plunger to get them out.
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "How fun was that?"
Patrick says: "It was so super duper fun."
SpongeBob says: "Boom!"
Patrick says: "Boom!"
Mr Krabs clears his throat.
SpongeBob says: "Did you need something, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, did I need something?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hmm, let me think."
Mr. Krabs says: "Did I need something?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes, I need something!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I need you 2 to get back in there and show them who's boss!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Show them what Short Order Boy and Pink Patty can really do!"
SpongeBob says: "Right!"
SpongeBob says: "C'mon, Patrick, let's show these two who they're messing with."
Patrick says: "With pleasure."
SpongeBob says: "Let's do this!"
Patrick says: "Let's do this!"
They both walk away with angry expressions.
Mr. Krabs says: "That's the million dollar winning spirit."
SpongeBob says: "Alright, you two, no more messing around."
SpongeBob says: "You see this?"
SpongeBob says: "There, you see that?"
SpongeBob says: "It's not gonna be pretty when I get done with ya."
Patrick says: "Hey, good one, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Now you try saying something intimidating as well."
Patrick says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, are you okay?"
Patrick says: "Huh?"
Patrick says: "Oh, I'm fine."
Patrick says: "I just like to suck on my hand."
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
SpongeBob says: "Me, too."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh."
Mr. Krabs says: "Heh heh."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now what?"
Wrestler #1 ties the rope to Patrick. He then picks up SpongeBob and puts the rope connected to Patrick behind his back. Then he pretends it's a paddleball.
Patrick says: "Good catch!"
SpongeBob says: "Look, I'm a..."
Patrick says: "Helicopter."
They collide and are shredded into pieces. They fall into a wagon and Wrestler #1 throws the wagon in a cement truck. Both scream as the truck starts blending them and the crowd cheers. Mr. Krabs bites on the rope nervously. Inside the truck, Wrestler #2 pulls the pour lever and SpongeBob and Patrick come out as cement and go into the wagon. Whistling, Wrestler #1 pours them into deep spaces and they dry out. Wrestler #1 puts his hand in SpongeBob and writes "Jim was here" with his finger. SpongeBob giggles. Wrestler #2 puts his foot in Patrick and writes "My foot was here" with his toe. Patrick giggles. The wrestlers both laugh and butt heads. Mr. Krabs pulls them out with 2 spatulas.
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you doing out there?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Fake wrestling."
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, but you still have to try to win in fake wrestling."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, we're having so much fun!"
SpongeBob says: "Doesn't that make us winners?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Actually..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, no!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Not the..."
The crowd gasps.
Perch Perkins says: "Wow, now that's a serious Sleeper Hold."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hello, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Fluffy."
Patrick and Wrestler #2 is doing the same thing. Patrick does baby talk before being handed a bottle.
Crowd says: "Aw."
The wrestlers then put them in a bed and cover them with a blanket.
Perch Perkins says: "And it looks like the champs are ready to end it."
Mr. Krabs says: "End it?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Crowd says: "End it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get up!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get up, you guys!!!"
The wrestlers dig a hole in the sand floor. Wrestler #1 grabs one of the ropes and the wrestlers use it as a slingshot to launch themselves high into the air and through the ceiling of the arena. They wrap their arms together and spin as they fall and crash back into the arena. As they do this, Perch speaks.
Perch Perkins says: "Yep."
Perch Perkins says: "They're gonna leave more than a mark with this special move."
Perch Perkins says: "The mother of all moves, the Flying Double Decker Atomic Headbutt of Destruction..."
Perch Perkins says: "with a spin."
Patrick says: "1 and 2 and squeeze..."
Patrick says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, who am I kidding?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Goodbye, money."
Patrick says: "Squeeze..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Goodbye, money."
Patrick says: "Squeeze..."
Patrick's Iron Buns rip through his costume.
Wrestlers #1 says: "Oh no!"
#2 says: "Oh no!"
Wrestler #2 says: "The Iron Butt!"
They land on Patrick's Iron Buns and crack, then shatter into pieces that are then swept up by the janitor, who is whistling.
Announcer says: "Ladies and gentlemen, here are your new champions!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Goodbye, mon-..."
Mr. Krabs says: "new champions?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Perch Perkins says: "That's right, Skip."
Perch Perkins says: "And the winner of one million dollars."
Mr. Krabs says: "Woo-hoo!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Money, sweet money!"
Perch Perkins says: "Or..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Or?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Perch Perkins says: "You can take what's behind Curtain #2."
Mr. Krabs says: "Curtain Number 2?"
Perch says: "Make all your dreams come true with 1 week at Wrestle Camp."
Mr. Krabs says: "Like we're really gonna turn all this money for..."
SpongeBob says: "Wrestle Camp!"
Patrick says: "Wrestle Camp!"
SpongeBob says: "Wrestle Camp, Wrestle Camp, Wrestle Camp!"
Patrick says: "Wrestle Camp, Wrestle Camp, Wrestle Camp!"
Perch Perkins says: "Wrestle Camp it is."
The janitor vacuums up all the money and Mr. Krabs falls apart, then the janitor walks away.
SpongeBob says: "See you at Wrestle Camp, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
He drops a Wrestle Camp hat on Mr. Krabs and episode ends.
