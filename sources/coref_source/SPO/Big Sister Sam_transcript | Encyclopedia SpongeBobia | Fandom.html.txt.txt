Squidward says: "Hey, Patrick, that oaf makes a better bulldozer than a sister!"
Squidward says: "Construction humor."
Sam says: "No laughing!"
SpongeBob says: "No, no, don't be upset with Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "He doesn't mean it, don't you, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Oh, I mean it, alright."
Squidward says: "She's a big buffoon, like Patrick."
Squidward says: "Except bigger, and dumber, and bufoonier."

Patrick says: "Awwww, hey, sis, don't listen to those..."
Patrick says: "meanies."
Patrick says: "Hey, the new rock is looking kinda..."
Patrick says: "boring."
Patrick says: "What do you say we decorate it?"
Sam says: "Blecorate?"
Patrick says: "You can call it whatever you like, sis, just as long as we make it spiffy!"
Sam says: "Make new house spiffy."
Sam says: "Spiffy!"
Squidward says: "Hey, you can't do that, that's my window!"
Sam says: "Blecorate."
Patrick says: "That's the spirit, Sis."
Squidward says: "Oh no."
Squidward says: "That is definitely not the spirit, Patrick."
Squidward says: "Your sister is out of control!"
Patrick says: "Hey, just mind your own business and let us blecorate in peace!"
Squidward says: "You can blecor-decorate until the sea cows come home for all I care, just don't use my property to do it!"
Sam says: "More spiffy!"
Squidward says: "But that's from..."
Squidward says: "My house!"
Squidward says: "That's it!"
Squidward says: "I have had my fill of this thieving brute!"
Patrick says: "Well, how dare you call my sister a thief, just- just 'cause she took some of your things..."
SpongeBob says: "Easy now, gents, let's not let tempers flare."
SpongeBob says: "Now don't you think, Patrick, that it's a teensie bit unfair that sister Sam dismantled Squidward's house?"
Patrick says: "No, I don't."
Patrick says: "Not even a teensie, eensie, teensie bit."
Patrick says: "I see now that not only have you turned against my sister, you've turned on your best friend as well!"

Sam says: "Meanies is mean."
Sam says: "."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward..."
SpongeBob says: "wait, Squidward, w-wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Before you do anything too rash, let me try to talk to them."
Squidward says: "The time for talk is over!"
Squidward says: "Now is the time for action!"
Squidward says: "tides of time!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't think you should do that."
Squidward says: "Who cares what you think?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "If it's destruction they want, it's destruction they'll get!"
Sam says: "Who makes noise?"
Sam says: "Sister mad!"
SpongeBob says: "Now, Sam, it's not what it seems."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward was just rearranging the spiffy."
Sam says: "Sister Sam rearrange now!"
SpongeBob says: "Please don't."
SpongeBob says: "Well, Squidward, at least on the bright side it will motivate you to finally take care of that kitchen remodel."
SpongeBob says: "Right, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Must be getting started."
Patrick says: "Huh?!"
Sam says: "Huh?!"
Patrick says: "!"

Patrick says: "You're still my rock, big sis."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I think your sister's temper is getting out of control."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, why are you still saying mean things about Sam?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "She destroyed my house in a fit of rage!"
SpongeBob says: "She needs to control her temper!"
Patrick says: "Well, I guess she can get a little carried away."
Sam says: "What Patrick doing?"
Sam says: "Why Patrick talk to meanies?"
Patrick says: "Well, uh..."
Patrick says: "well..."
Patrick says: "well it's about your temper, Sam."
Sam says: "No have temper!"
Sam says: "This makes sister Sam SO mad!"
Sam says: "Sister Sam put on mean face!"
Patrick says: "Not the rock!"
Sam says: "Patrick?"
Sam says: "Little brubber?"
Sam says: "Little brubber?"
Sam says: "Little brubber no wake."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Cookie dough!"
Sam says: "Patrick okay!"
Sam says: "Sister Sam feel bad."
Sam says: "Sorry she hurt Patrick."
Sam says: "Should protect little brubber."
Sam says: "She go now."
Patrick says: "Sis, no, hold on!"
Patrick says: "Aw, don't feel sad."
Patrick says: "You don't have to go!"
Sam says: "Yes, Sister Sam must go."
Sam says: "Late for manicure."
Sam says: "Bye, brubber!"
Patrick says: "Bye, sis."
