Squidward says: "Wow."
Squidward says: "Squidward, this is the best soufflé you have ever created."
SpongeBob Bubble says: "Hi, Patrick."
Patrick giggles as he was about to blow a bubble. He eats the bubble and whispers into another bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob where it pops.
Patrick Bubble says: "Hi, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob giggles and Squidward, now annoyed, notices a liquid coming from his soufflé, pours it into a bowl and starts rapidly stirring the liquid with a fork until it becomes bubbly. Meanwhile, outside, Spongebob whispers into another bubble.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you're my best friend in the whole neighborhood."
The scene cuts to Squidward's back window as he finishes stirring the liquid, and blows a bubble with it through the fork. Squidward's bubble is approached by SpongeBob's bubble, grows a leg, and kicks SpongeBob's bubble, thus popping it. Squidward's bubble floats over to Patrick and pops.
Squidward Bubble says: "Patrick, you are the dumbest idiot it has ever been my misfortune to know."
Patrick frowns and blows a bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob.
Patrick Bubble says: "Do you really think that, SpongeBob?"
Patrick Bubble says: "Yeah?"
Patrick Bubble says: "Well, I think you're ugly."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what are you talking about?"
The bubble floats over to Patrick. Another bubble of Squidward's bubbles floats over to SpongeBob and pops.
Squidward Bubble says: "You give bottom dwellers a bad name."
Squidward creates several other bubbles and they float over to SpongeBob.
Squidward Bubble says: "If I had a dollar for every brain you don't have, I'd have one dollar!"
Squidward chuckles. Another bubble floats over to Patrick.
Squidward Bubble says: "Hey, Patrick, I heard there was a job opening down at the pet shop..."
Squidward Bubble says: "as some newspaper!"
Patrick says: "Well, that makes you a big dummy, you dummy!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, well, that means that, uhh..."
SpongeBob says: "so are you!"
Patrick says: "Right, you're a turkey!"
SpongeBob says: "What's that?"
Patrick says: "It's what you are!"
Squidward begins to laugh hysterically at SpongeBob and Patrick's arguing.
SpongeBob says: "Well, you're a bigger one!"
Patrick says: "Well, you're still yellow!"
Patrick says: "And you know what else is yellow?"
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Patrick says: "You are!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, it doesn't matter what you call me, 'cause I never wanna see you again anyway!"
Patrick angrily opens his rock, which closes and comes up sounding like an accordion. .
Patrick says: "Wow, Squidward, you're choking!"
Patrick says: "I win!"
Squidward says: "Wow!"
Squidward says: "Patrick, you saved me!"
Patrick says: "I did?"
Squidward says: "Yup!"
Squidward says: "You're a real lifesaver, friend!"
Patrick says: "Friend?"
Patrick says: "Friend..."
Patrick says: "So what are we gonna do tonight, best friend?"
Squidward says: "Well, I was going to practice my clarinet solo."
Patrick says: "Clarinet?"
Patrick says: "I love music!"
SpongeBob says: "Ahh, who needs them?"
SpongeBob says: "They're no fun anyway, right, Gary?"
Squidward says: "Squidward will be performing his version of Solitude in E minor."
SpongeBob says: "Ah, what am I worried about?"
SpongeBob says: "I got plenty of friends!"
SpongeBob says: "I can name three right off the bat!"
SpongeBob says: "Ohhh!"
Squidward is dragging Patrick, who is still asleep, outside. Suddenly, after a few feet, his back gives out.
Squidward says: "Ow!"
Squidward says: "Oh!"
Squidward says: "My back!"
Squidward says: "I threw out my back!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob?"
Squidward says: "No, no, stay back!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm coming!"
Squidward says: "No, no, no, get away from me!"
SpongeBob says: "Hang on!"
SpongeBob says: "I'll save you!"
Squidward says: "No, no!"
Squidward says: "Get away from me!"
Squidward says: "No, no!"
SpongeBob says: "Hold on!"
Squidward says: "No, no!"
Squidward says: "Get away!"
SpongeBob says: "Friend..."
Squidward says: "N-no, no, no, I didn't mean that, no-no."
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Squiddy, old pal."
SpongeBob says: "That's what friends are for."
SpongeBob says: "So dumb Patrick fell asleep on ya, huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Some friend."
SpongeBob says: "A real friend would perform for you!"
Squidward says: "You play?"
SpongeBob says: "Are you kidding?"
SpongeBob says: "I've been playing bassinet for years!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward is my best friend in the sea..."
The bow flies into what looks like Squidward's head and he screams. Fortunately, it turns out it's just a painting; the real Squidward pulls the bow out and growls as he snaps it in half with his knee.
SpongeBob says: "Squidward..."
Patrick says: "Oh!"
Squidward says: "Grrrrrryehhhhherrrryeh!"
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "So, uhh, I'll see you tomorrow, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Call me!"
Squidward says: "Yech!"
Squidward says: "That was disgusting!"
Squidward says: "I feel like I need to scrub myself."
Patrick says: "Hey, buddy."
Patrick says: "I warmed it up for ya."
Squidward says: "Patrick!"
Squidward says: "Get out!"
Squidward says: "And put some clothes on!"
SpongeBob says: "What's the matter, Squidward, old buddy?"
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "rubber bath toys!"
Patrick says: "Oh, yeah?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "Well, he was my friend first!"
SpongeBob says: "You're just a backbiting, backstabbing silly blob of..."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Buddy!"
Patrick says: "Squidward, where are you?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Where'd ya go, friend?"
Patrick says: "Where are ya, ol' buddy?"
Squidward says: "Oh, this is nuts!"
Squidward says: "I need a plan to get those two back together and outta my hair!"
SpongeBob says: "Did you miss me?"
Squidward says: "Come on in!"
Squidward says: "You look stunning."
SpongeBob says: "I'd much rather dine with you than that lousy..."
SpongeBob says: "Say, what gives?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm not sitting near that maniac!"
Patrick says: "Me neither!"
Patrick says: "This was a setup!"
Squidward says: "I thought you two were my best friends."
SpongeBob says: "I am your best friend!"
Patrick says: "I am your best friend!"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, please!"
Patrick says: "How about some for your best friend?"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, best friend!"
Patrick says: "Can I have some now, buddy?"
SpongeBob says: "Wait, I need some more!"
Patrick says: "I still didn't get any!"
SpongeBob says: "There ya go."
SpongeBob says: "More please!"
Patrick says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Hey, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Patrick!"
Squidward says: "Your glass is full!"
Patrick says: "Oh, yeah..."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Hey, Squidward!"

Patrick says: "Hey, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Sorry, boys, I'm all out of pop."
Squidward says: "I'm gonna go get some more."
SpongeBob says: "Guess what, Squidward?"
Patrick says: "Me and SpongeBob are friends again!"
Squidward says: "Great, now go be friends somewhere else."
SpongeBob says: "Don't you want us to help you clean this up a little?"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "Out!"
SpongeBob says: "Psst, I think he's jealous."
Patrick says: "How pathetic."
Squidward says: "Ohhhhh, my back."
