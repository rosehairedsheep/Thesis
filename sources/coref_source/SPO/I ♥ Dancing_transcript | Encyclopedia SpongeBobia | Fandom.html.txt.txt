The scene zooms in on Squidward's house. The door opens and Squidward appears.
Squidward says: "The coast looks clear..."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Today, I feel like doing some dancing!"
Squidward says: "That's funny."
Squidward says: "Even a barnacle knows you need music to dance."
SpongeBob says: "Oh-ho, I got music, friend..."
Squidward says: "That is the stupidest dance move I've ever seen!"
SpongeBob says: "Who put you on the planet?"
SpongeBob says: "Rueegh!"
SpongeBob says: "Your Krabby Patty, ma'am."
SpongeBob says: "Now eat it, swallow it, and chew it down!"
Female Fish says: "Oh, thank you very much, darling."
Female Fish says: "And your dance moves are pretty cool, too."
SpongeBob says: "You like my dancin'?"
Female Fish says: "That's right, kid."
Female Fish says: "You got the dazzle, dazzle, dazzle."
Female Fish says: "I love how you did that shuffle into the moonsault, and then stuck the landing!"
Female Fish says: "Wait!"
Female Fish says: "I'm not finished speaking words."
Female Fish says: "I'm a high-class talent agent and I want to invite you to an audition."
Female Fish says: "I have a very talented client who needs a backup dancer and you got what it takes!"
Squidward says: "Would you please stop dancing?"
SpongeBob says: "No, I can't stop dancin' now, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I have to practice for my big audition tomorrow!"
Squidward says: "You got a dance audition?"
SpongeBob says: "That's right!"
SpongeBob says: "Got a dance audition."
Squidward says: "That idiot has a dance audition?"
Squidward says: "He doesn't know the first thing about the subtle intricacies of dance!"
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "I suppose I could take you under my tutelage, you know, show you a few moves."
SpongeBob says: "Under your tutelage, really?"
SpongeBob says: "You mean it?"
Squidward says: "But, you must do exactly what I say."
Squidward says: "Got that?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, what are you doing, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Oh, um, just a physical assessment I do with all of my new pupils."
Squidward says: "Yeah, I'd say judging from the condition of those flabby ankles..."
SpongeBob says: "Flabby?"
Squidward says: "That's right."
Squidward says: "You need some physical conditioning before you ever set foot on a dance parquet."
Squidward says: "I want you to run to the top of Oyster Peak then back."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, anything to get rid of these flabby ankles of mine."
Squidward says: "What are you doing here?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm back from Mount Oyster!"
Squidward says: "Fine!"
Squidward says: "My treadmill!"
SpongeBob says: "You know, Squidward, exercising's fun and all, but when am I gonna learn some dancing?"
Squidward says: "All right!"
Squidward says: "You wanna learn some dancing?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "I'll show you dancing!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoo!"
Squidward says: "Now, do just as I did."
SpongeBob says: "Like this?"
SpongeBob says: "Like that, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Okay, try this."
Squidward says: "Now you."
SpongeBob says: "Gee, I don't know."
SpongeBob says: "Are you sure?"
Squidward says: "You want to ace the audition, don't you?"
Squidward says: "Then do it!"
Squidward says: "And aha!"
Squidward says: "You think you can handle that?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, sir."
Squidward says: "Then go and practice it, and don't stop until you've done exactly as I did."
SpongeBob says: "No."
Squidward says: "Remember, don't stop till you've done it right."
SpongeBob says: "Right, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Well, SpongeBob, have you learned the moves?"
Squidward says: "Aw, come on, now."
Squidward says: "After all I've done for you?"
Squidward says: "We've got one day, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, you're right."
SpongeBob says: "Is that okay, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "I'm still not convinced."
SpongeBob says: "And a-one, and a-two..."
Squidward says: "Good night, sweet prince, and hello, stardom for yours truly."
Twin Sisters says: "I told you it was a stupid idea..."
Twin Sisters says: "and I hate you, too!"
Talent Agent says: "SpongeBob?!"
Talent Agent says: "!"
Talent Agent says: "I guess he's not here."
Talent Agent says: "It's too bad, he was good."
Talent Agent says: "But who could replace a dancer of such high-caliber?"
Squidward says: "Only the best dancer in Bikini Bottom."
Talent Agent says: "Really?"
Talent Agent says: "Well, I'll be the judge of that."
Talent Agent says: "Oh, sweet sassafras!"
Talent Agent says: "Do mine eyes deceive me?"
Talent Agent says: "That was the greatest routine since the greatest thing since sliced bread dancing routine!"
Talent Agent says: "You got the gig!"
Squidward says: "Oh, baby, I knew it!"
Squidward says: "You won't be sorry you made this decision."
Talent Agent says: "I don't think you'll be sorry either, because you'll be dancing in..."
Talent Agent says: "..."
Talent Agent says: "Squilliam's show!"
Squidward says: "Squ--squ--squ--squ--squ--squ--squ--squidawa!"
Squilliam says: "Well, don't just stand there!"
Squilliam says: "Get the sand out of your leotard and dance for me, nitwit."
