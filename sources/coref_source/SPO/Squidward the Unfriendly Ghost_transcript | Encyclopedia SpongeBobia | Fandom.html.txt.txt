Squidward says: "What are you invertebrates doing?"
SpongeBob says: "We don't know."
Patrick says: "We don't know."
Squidward says: "Hey, Patrick, do you know what time it is?"
Patrick says: "Uh, yeah, Squidward, it's..."
Squidward says: "Time to find some other game to play!"
SpongeBob says: "Now what?"
Patrick says: "We could toss that shell back and forth."
Patrick says: "Go!"

SpongeBob says: "I think something's wrong with Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "He looks unconscious."
Patrick says: "Don't worry."
Patrick says: "I know how to do this."
SpongeBob says: "Get off him, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "What are you worried about?"
SpongeBob says: "But he still feels cold."
Patrick says: "Well, let's go put him in the warm."
SpongeBob says: "Do you think he'll be okay?"
Patrick says: "You know, you worry too much."
SpongeBob says: "I don't know."
Patrick says: "It kind of looks like..."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "No, no, that part goes here."
Patrick says: "Yeah-yeah, that's it, uh-huh."
SpongeBob says: "We're almost there."
SpongeBob says: "We can do this."
Patrick says: "It's working, it's working..."
SpongeBob says: "This is working."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, this isn't working!"
Patrick says: "Look!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know how to say it, but our old pal Squidward, he's..."
SpongeBob says: "He's..."
SpongeBob says: "He's pushing up daisies!"
Patrick says: "Oh, I thought he was dead."
Squidward says: "What are you doing here?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "Well?"
Squidward says: "Are you two trying to say something, or do I have to..."
Squidward says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "No, stay back!"
Squidward says: "What is the matter with you two?"
Patrick says: "Don't, don't hurt us!"
SpongeBob says: "It was an accident!"
Squidward says: "What are you two talking about?"
Squidward says: "Look what you've done to me!"
Squidward says: "When I get my hands on you, I'll..."
Patrick says: "Oh, yes, Mr."
Patrick says: "Squidward's ghost!"
Patrick says: "Please don't haunt us!"
SpongeBob says: "We'll do anything you want!"
SpongeBob says: "Just have mercy on us!"
Squidward says: "Enough!"
Squidward says: "Listen up, Squidward's ghost is feeling unusually generous today."
Squidward says: "He hath decided to spare ye a horrible fate."
Squidward says: "All ye must do is tend to my every whim and tickle my fancy on demand."
SpongeBob says: "Does that include..."
Squidward says: "Quiet!"
Squidward says: "Now, do as you're told!"
Squidward says: "Lest ye incur the wrath of Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Here?"
Squidward says: "Too hot."
SpongeBob says: "Here?"
Squidward says: "No, too wet."
Squidward says: "Keep going."
Squidward says: "Keep going."
SpongeBob says: "Here?"
Squidward says: "Too loose, Lautrec."
SpongeBob says: "Too tired..."
Squidward says: "Perfect."
Squidward says: "Hmmm, I feel needy."
Squidward says: "Slaves, fetcheth me some nourishment."
SpongeBob says: "Only the freshest, o spooky one."
Patrick says: "One watermelon..."
SpongeBob says: "Art thou not pleased?"
Squidward says: "Enough of that!"
Squidward says: "I want something else to eat now."
Squidward says: "Something that's very difficult to find."
Patrick says: "What do you hunger for, master?"
SpongeBob says: "Whatever you want, we'll find it."
SpongeBob says: "We'll find it."
Squidward says: "Cherry pie."
Squidward says: "Where'd you get that?"
Patrick says: "I found it."
Squidward says: "Well, go find it again!"
Squidward says: "Say "flank steak"."
SpongeBob says: "Flank steak."
Squidward says: "I think I'm beginning to like this."
Squidward says: "Stop."
SpongeBob says: "But this is just a piece of tissue paper."
Squidward says: "Oh, my."
Squidward says: "Always having to have it our way, don't we?"
Squidward says: "Oh, boo-hoo."
SpongeBob says: "I can't do it!"
Squidward says: "Well, I hope you don't have any plans tonight, 'cause you're not allowed to leave that spot till I hear a song."
Squidward says: "What's this?"
Squidward says: "Napping on the job?"
Squidward says: "You're supposed to be making music for me."
Squidward says: "As punishment for this insolence, Squidward's ghost commandeth you to clean out his back room."
Squidward says: "I'll take that!"
Patrick says: "Yes, your ghostliness!"
Patrick says: "This is fun."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, are you ready for this?"
Patrick says: "Yes."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, let's go."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, are you coming?"
Patrick says: "Yes."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, it's this way."
Patrick says: "Where?"
SpongeBob says: "Here."
Patrick says: "How are we going to clean up all this mess?"
SpongeBob says: "It's easy."
SpongeBob says: "Just tear this wallpaper off!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, let's see."
SpongeBob says: "It's a comic book, and look at this."
SpongeBob says: "It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman."
SpongeBob says: "It says when he died they used his body as a window display."
SpongeBob says: "Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest."
SpongeBob says: "Well, don't you get it, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "We're going to go shopping?"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest."
Squidward says: "Ow!"
Squidward says: "What the heck was that?"
SpongeBob says: "Initiation!"
SpongeBob says: "That was part one of your ceremony."
Squidward says: "Ceremony for what?"
SpongeBob says: "We're going to put you to rest."
Squidward says: "I don't want to be put to rest!"
Squidward says: "All I want are those chores done."
Squidward says: "Now, did you clean the back room yet?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
Squidward says: "Oh, really?"
Squidward says: "I'm going to go check."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, get in."
Squidward says: "Are you crazy?"
Squidward says: "I'm not getting in that thing!"
SpongeBob says: "But you said we could put you to rest."
Squidward says: "I didn't say anything like that!"
Squidward says: "Now, get out of my house!"
Squidward pushes SpongeBob and Patrick outside.
Squidward says: "Now what?"
SpongeBob says: "I wrote "Here lies Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "You may not remember him, but he..."
SpongeBob says: ""  Oh, hi, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Does this look deep enough?"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "Cut that out!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, look, the mourners have arrived."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, Squidward, we all came as soon as we were sure you were dead."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, are you trying to put me in the nuthouse?"
SpongeBob says: "No, just into this hole."
SpongeBob says: "You're bald?"
Squidward says: "No, I'm not bald!"
Squidward says: "I'm alive!"
Squidward says: "Now get rid of that tombstone and tell all your friends to go home!"
Squidward says: "Do it!"
SpongeBob says: "Go home."
Squidward says: "I'm not your master, I'm your neighbor."
Squidward says: "Now do me a favor and stop doing me favors!"
SpongeBob says: "As you wish, master."
Squidward says: "D'oh!"
Patrick says: "Boy, he really had us fooled."
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick, he's the fool."
SpongeBob says: "He's a ghost in denial."
SpongeBob says: "He needs us now more than ever."
Patrick says: "You're right."
Patrick says: "He really needs to get up to the great beyond."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, say that again."
Patrick says: "That again?"
SpongeBob says: "No, the other thing."
Patrick says: "No, the other thing."
SpongeBob says: "No, what you said before when you..."
Patrick says: "No, what you said before when you..."
SpongeBob says: "Never mind!"
SpongeBob says: "I've got an idea."
Patrick says: "Never mind!"
Patrick says: "I've got an idea."
SpongeBob says: "I can't reach him!"
Patrick says: "Blow harder!"
Patrick says: "There he goes!"
SpongeBob says: "Isn't he beautiful?"
Patrick says: "How high's he going to go?"
SpongeBob says: "All the way, Patrick, up to the great beyond."
SpongeBob says: "Goodbye, friend!"
Patrick says: "Happy trails!"
SpongeBob says: "You're welcome!"
Patrick says: "You're welcome!"
SpongeBob says: "He's on the other side now."
Patrick says: "Yeah."
