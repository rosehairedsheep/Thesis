The scene starts out at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is looking at Plankton through a telescope.
Plankton says: "I surrender!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Eh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I wonder what form of trickery is up that miniature cyclops' sleeve this time."
Mr. Krabs says: "Alright, Plankton, I don't know what you're trying to pull on me, but I'll tell ya right now, it ain't going to work."
Plankton says: "There's no pulling, Krabs."
Plankton says: "Can't you see my peace offering?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What is this?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ha-ha!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Very funny, Plankton!"
Mr. Krabs says: "But you're gonna have to do a lot better than taking a stab at my illiteracy to offend me."
Plankton says: "Don't you get it, Krabs?"
Plankton says: "I give up."
Plankton says: "I'm through competing with you!"
Mr. Krabs says: "But what about all those fevered attempts at trying to steal my Krabby Patty recipe?"
Plankton says: "Exactly!"
Plankton says: "They've all been just attempts."
Plankton says: "And every single one a miserable failure."
Plankton says: "I can feel my arteries clogging up with anxiety just thinking about it."
Plankton says: "Look at this place!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Criminy, Plankton, you ever heard of spring cleaning?"
Plankton says: "What's the point?"
Plankton says: "Do you know when the last time I had a customer was?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Actually, I don't recall you ever having a customer."
Plankton says: "Well, there he is."
Plankton says: "this!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You want to turn your restaurant into a pile of junk?"
Plankton says: "No!"
Plankton says: "These are knickknacks for the new gift shop I'm opening up."
Mr. Krabs says: "Come on, this has got to be a joke, right?"
Plankton says: "I'm serious, Krabs."
Plankton says: "Soon, the Chum Bucket will be a nice little store for bric-a-brac and bubblegum."
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, Plankton."
Mr. Krabs says: "But be aware, I'm not letting my guard down."
Plankton says: "Guard away, my ex-enemy."
Plankton says: "I'll just be here starting my new competition-free career."
SpongeBob says: "What's going on Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton's concocting another hair-brained scheme to steal me recipe."
Mr. Krabs says: "So keep your eyes peeled."
SpongeBob says: "Whatever you say, cap'n."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now that's an employee who follows orders."
Plankton says: "Ah, would you look at that?"
Plankton says: "I have a feeling I'm going to like this new life of novelty items."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh-huh."
Mr. Krabs says: "Clever, Plankton!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Two can play at this game."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, look at this cool knickknack I got at the Chumporium."
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I really don't think there's anything weird in there."
Mr. Krabs says: "Eh, we'll see about that."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now nobody's getting to see anything."
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't you understand this is all part of his ruse."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's just cosmetic."
Mr. Krabs says: "He thinks he can take us out."
Mr. Krabs says: "But we'll show him."
Mr. Krabs says: "We're gonna out-fake the faker."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, it looks like old Plankton is really going through with it."
Mr. Krabs says: "I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yup, we sure whipped him this time."
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, boys, the coast is clear."
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton's turned over a new leaf."
SpongeBob says: "That's some good news, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "It sure is, you little half-wit."
Mr. Krabs says: "And you know what else is good news?"
Mr. Krabs says: "We can finally use that DJ system."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hit it, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Right away, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "Let's party!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ow!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I won!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's time to boogie."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
Squidward says: "This is idiotic."
Mr. Krabs says: "Dance or you're fired."
Squidward says: "You got it, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs."
Plankton says: "Come on, buddy, let's get some shut eye."
Plankton says: "We have a big day ahead of us at the Chumporium Gift Shop."
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait a minute."
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You may have fooled everyone else, you might have even fooled yourself, but you ain't fooling me."
Plankton says: "Oh, I get it."
Plankton says: "You caught me red-handed."
Plankton says: "Those were the days, huh Eugene?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Grr..."
Plankton says: "But I found there more to life than just trying to steal your formula."
Plankton says: "And I found it all right here in novelty items."
Mr. Krabs says: "Bubkes."
Plankton says: "Ah, Eugene."
Plankton says: "Stuck in your old ways."
Mr. Krabs says: "Bubkes!"
Mr. Krabs says: "If there's one thing certain in this world, it's that you can't resist me formula."
Mr. Krabs says: "You know you want it."
Plankton says: "Thanks, but no."
Mr. Krabs says: "A-ha, I knew it."
Mr. Krabs says: "It was all a trick to get me to hand over..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait, did you say no?"
Plankton says: "Well, if you don't believe me, that's your problem not mine."
Mr. Krabs says: "Problem?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't have a problem!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're the one with the problem!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Look at this."
Mr. Krabs says: "It means nothing."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's all a facade, a hoax, a con, a front..."
Mr. Krabs says: "See?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Who's the one with the problem?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Plankton says: "Look what you've done."
Plankton says: "This is my livelihood."
Mr. Krabs says: "Sure it is."
Mr. Krabs says: "And this isn't the formula that you don't want."
Mr. Krabs says: "Come on, eh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Eh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oop."
Mr. Krabs says: "Too slow."
Plankton says: "GET OUT!!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oops."
Plankton says: "What's this?"
Plankton says: "Hey, Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I knew you'd come back."
Plankton says: "You forgot something."
Mr. Krabs says: "I never thought I'd see the day."
Mr. Krabs says: "What happened to the invertebrate I used to know?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton!"
Plankton says: "Coming, coming."
Plankton says: "Yo."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, Plankton?"
Plankton says: "Eugene?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, hey."
Plankton says: "Hey."
Mr. Krabs says: "Listen, uh, I just wanted to..."
Mr. Krabs says: "you know..."
Mr. Krabs says: "apologize for my behavior today."
Mr. Krabs says: "Wasn't right what I done."
Mr. Krabs says: "And I realized I hurt the feelings of, uh, someone I care about."
Mr. Krabs says: "You still there?"
Plankton says: "Yes."
Plankton says: "I'm still here."
Mr. Krabs says: "Heh, good."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I want to make it up to you."
Mr. Krabs says: "What do you say we grab a soda?"
Plankton says: "Sure."
Mr. Krabs says: "Glad you could make it, buddy."
Plankton says: "So, what's this about, Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I figured since we're no longer archenemies, maybe, maybe we can start over."
Plankton says: "Yes."
Plankton says: "Yes, I would like that very much."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, I don't know about this, Plankton."
Plankton says: "Oh, come on."
Plankton says: "Just fall back."
Plankton says: "Trust me, I'll catch you."
Mr. Krabs says: "That was truly amazing, Plank, old buddy."
Mr. Krabs says: "I guess I really can trust you 100%."
Plankton says: "Thanks, Eugene."
Plankton says: "That means a lot to me."
Mr. Krabs says: "And just to prove it to you, I want you to have something."
Plankton says: "Oh, no, no, come on now."
Plankton says: "No gifts."
Mr. Krabs says: "No, no."
Mr. Krabs says: "I want you to have this."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's the secret formula."
Plankton says: "I can't believe you would even think..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Things are different now."
Mr. Krabs says: "Honestly."
Mr. Krabs says: "It would mean a lot to me."
Plankton says: "You..."
Plankton says: "you're serious."
Plankton says: "Eugene, if I take this formula from you now, there will always be a hint of doubt."
Mr. Krabs says: "Come on, take it."
Plankton says: "You sure?"
Plankton says: "Life is good, Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Sure is, buddy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Sure is."
Plankton says: "Yeah, baby!"
Plankton says: "This is it."
Plankton says: "Yeah!"
Plankton says: "Whoo!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'd never give you the formula."
Mr. Krabs says: "I fooled you with an even more convoluted charade."
