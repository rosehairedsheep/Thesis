It is a normal day at the Krusty Krab. All of a sudden, Plankton, disguised as a peppershaker, steals a Krabby Patty from a customer.
Plankton says: "Ha ha!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hold it right there, Plankton."
Plankton says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll take that."
Plankton says: "How'd you know it was me?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Next time, wear a disguise without your initial on it."
Plankton says: "Hmmm..."
Plankton says: "perhaps a peppershaker was a bit obvious."
Mr. Krabs says: "You think?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Wooo-ooo!"
Plankton says: "AAHH!"
Cut to the park. Plankton is on a bench.
Plankton says: "Never!"
Plankton says: "Never!"
Plankton says: "I'll never get Krabs' formula!"
Plankton says: "Mr."
Plankton says: "Krabs is too powerful."
Plankton says: "If only there were a way to render him helpless!"
Sadie says: "Oh, look at you, you're so small, tiny and helpless."
Plankton says: "Hey, I resent that!"
Plankton says: "Huh?"
Plankton says: "Something about that woman reminds me of my mother."
Plankton says: "That's it!"
Plankton says: "Finally, victory will be mine!"
Plankton says: "I'll turn Eugene Krabs into a powerless… baby."
Cut to Mr. Krabs walking up to his restaurant.
Plankton says: "I've done it!"
Plankton says: "Nothing can stop me now!"
Plankton says: "My goo goo gas will transform Krabs into a tiny helpless infant!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, a baby!"
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing out here all alone, baby?"
SpongeBob says: "I'll take charge of you until your mommy shows up!"
Plankton says: "Hello!"
Plankton says: "If you're done making a total fool out of yourself, I could use some help with this lock."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, sure thing, Plankton."
Plankton says: "Yes, my plan is working perfectly!"
Plankton says: "Now that I've turned Krabs into a helpless baby, the Krabby Patty formula will be mine!"
Plankton says: "Hello."
SpongeBob says: "Police!"
SpongeBob says: "Police!"
Plankton says: "That was easy."
Plankton says: "I'm free!"
Plankton says: "Free!"
Squidward walks up to the Krusty Krab, looking glum as always.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Thank Neptune you're here."
SpongeBob says: "I found this baby all alone."
SpongeBob says: "But he wasn't really alone, he was with Plankton!"
SpongeBob says: "And he's not a baby!"
SpongeBob says: "What do we do, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "I don't know about you, but I'm going on my coffee break."
Squidward says: "A very long coffee break."
Plankton says: "Now I'll never be a tyrannical overlord."
Karen says: "Do I have to tell you how to do everything?"
Karen says: "Next time, spray SpongeBob, too."
Plankton says: "Not sure I follow you."
Karen says: "Listen carefully."
Karen says: "Spray..."
Plankton says: "Yes."
Karen says: "..."
Karen says: "Sponge..."
Karen says: "."
Plankton says: "Uh-huh."
Karen says: "..."
Karen says: "."
Karen says: "Bob..."
Karen says: ".."
Plankton says: "Right."
Karen says: "..."
Karen says: "."
Karen says: "Too!"
Plankton says: "Now you're just talking gibberish."
Plankton says: "What I really need is to spray Mr."
Plankton says: "Krabs and SpongeBob."
Karen says: "Ugh!"
Karen says: "That's just what I..."
Plankton says: "I don't wanna hear anymore of your loony schemes, Karen."
Plankton says: "I've got work to do!"
Back at the Krusty Krab, baby Krabs starts to cry.
SpongeBob says: "Aw, what's wrong, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Baby Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "Are you thirsty?"
Plankton says: "Hands in the air!"
SpongeBob says: "Plankton!"
Plankton says: "Barnacles, I've run out of gas!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ahem!"
Plankton says: "Krabs!"
Plankton says: "Nice diaper."
Plankton says: "Yes, I've got it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton!"
Plankton says: "Peek-a-boo!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I can't tolerate your stinky gas!"
Miss Shell says: "That makes two of us."
Dennis says: "I don't do it on purpose!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You'll never catch me, Plankton!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Never!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ooh…another penny!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Come to papa!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, what were we doing?"
Plankton says: "This!"
Plankton says: "What the heck happened to you?"
Plankton says: "This isn't baby gas, it's senior citizen spray!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Eh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What was that, sonny?"
Plankton says: "Out of my way, Methuselah!"
Plankton says: "You're old and useless."
SpongeBob says: "Hold it right there!"
SpongeBob says: "Old people are out greatest natural resource!"
SpongeBob says: "I salute you, elder citizenry!"
Plankton says: "I'm getting old listening to this."
Plankton says: "Let's try this again!"
SpongeBob says: "I remember when a quarter used to cost a nickel."
Plankton says: "This baby gas is worthless!"
Plankton says: "At least you're way too old to stop me from stealing a Krabby Patty!"
SpongeBob says: "What was that, sonny?"
Plankton says: "It'll take more time to explain than you have left."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "He's got the Krabby Patty!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Catch him!"
SpongeBob says: "Catch who?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, Gesundheit."
Plankton says: "Victory is mine!"
SpongeBob says: "Come back here, you little whippersnapper!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You kids get off my lawn!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll catch up with you, boy!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm catching up with my knitting."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Knit, little nitwit!"
Plankton says: "That was almost too easy."
Plankton says: "What?"
Plankton says: "No!"
Plankton says: "I demand you geezers release me!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Right after the party."
Mr. Krabs says: "The piñata party."
Plankton says: "What?"
Senior Citizens says: "That's for calling us old."
Plankton says: "Hey, quit it!"
Senior Citizens says: "I want candy!"
Plankton says: "No!"
Cut to the Chum Bucket, with Plankton in his lab, writing something on a chalk board.
Plankton says: "One squirt equals baby, carry over the two plus the square root of SpongeBob."
Plankton says: "Of course!"
Plankton says: "The final ingredient that I've been lacking!"
Plankton says: "It's so simple yet so evil!"
Plankton says: "And I know just the place to get it."
Cut to Barg'n Mart.
Plankton says: "Excuse me, what aisle did you get that from?"
Shubie says: "You mean the Kelp-O?"
Plankton says: "No, that thing--the ugly, drippy, smelly thing."
Shubie says: "Are you talking about my baby, creep?!"
Shubie says: "!"
Plankton says: "Ow, ow, ow!"
Plankton says: "That powdered baby did the trick!"
Plankton says: "Now my baby gas can't possibly fail!"
Karen says: "Just like all your other plans that "couldn't possibly fail"?"
Plankton says: "What is it now, Karen?"
Karen says: "I'm saying you should test your gas before you run over there all willy nilly!"
Plankton says: "That's an excellent idea."
Plankton says: "And I know just the guinea pig!"
Plankton says: "Karen!"
Plankton says: "Speak to me!"
Plankton says: "It worked!"
Cut to the Krusty Krab, where the old Mr. Krabs is drinking a soda.
Plankton says: "Everyone say your ABCs!"
SpongeBob says: "What's wrong, little feller?"
Cut to an aerial view of the Krusty Krab where everyone is turning into babies. Patrick is seen turning into a baby. Squidward opens the bathroom door and sees what's going on, then walks away. A gas bomb explodes in the bathroom turning Squidward into a crying baby.
Plankton says: "My moment of triumph!"
Plankton says: "Oh, gross!"
Plankton says: "I command you to stop drooling on me!"
Baby Mr. Krabs says: "Goo!"
Plankton says: "Mama's evil little genius needs a diaper!"
