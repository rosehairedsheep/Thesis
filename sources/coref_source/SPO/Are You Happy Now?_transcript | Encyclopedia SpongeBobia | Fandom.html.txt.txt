Narrator says: "Ahhh..."
Narrator says: "The Krusty Krab, Bikini Bottom's answer to fine dining."
Narrator says: "And here we see one of its patrons now."
Narrator says: "Ah..."
Narrator says: "yes, moving on."
Narrator says: "Oh, it is the SpongeBob, creator of the fine cuisine within."
Narrator says: "Now let us watch."
Squidward says: "One Krabby Patty, extra grease."
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
Squidward says: "Mmm."
SpongeBob says: "Ooh!"
Squidward says: "Grr..."
Squidward says: "All right, let me see it."
Squidward says: "The Krusty Krab work schedule, what's so great about this?"
SpongeBob says: "What's so..."
SpongeBob says: "why, it's my happy book."
SpongeBob says: "The Krusty Krab is where all of my happiest memories occurred."
Squidward says: "Hmmm..."
Squidward says: "Oops, I accidentally burned up your memories."
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "So what's your happiest memory, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Ummm, let me think..."
SpongeBob thinks and he pops out from Squidward's boat.
Squidward says: "Yes?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, you don't have a happiest memory?"
Squidward says: "So what?"
SpongeBob says: "How can you live without a happiest memory?"
SpongeBob says: "Do you cry yourself to sleep at night?"
Squidward says: "I hear you crying all the time."
SpongeBob says: "Well, with joy, Squidward, with joy."
Squidward says: "Look, I don't need a happy memory, so just get back to your culinary grease factory and leave me alone."
Sandals says: "Hey, I'd like to order a Krabby Patty, please."
Sandals says: "Okay..."
Sandals says: "can someone else take my order?"
SpongeBob appears out from Squidward's boat again and cries with him.
Sandals says: "I'll wait."
SpongeBob continues crying.
Squidward says: "You're right, SpongeBob, I don't have a happy memory."
Squidward says: "This is horrible!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Squidward, I'll help you make a happiest memory."
Squidward says: "Really?"
Squidward says: "Do you think you can?"
SpongeBob says: "No problem."
Squidward says: "Well, it's against my better judgement, but, okay."
At a concert, a song plays.
SpongeBob says: "You love music, right, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Mmm hmm."
SpongeBob says: "Then this will definitely be your happiest memory!"
Squidward says: "Hey, this isn't so bad."
Squidward says: "I think I actually feel kinda..."
Squidward says: "happy!"
SpongeBob says: "See?"
SpongeBob says: "Your happiest memory is forming!"
Nat plays his violin but his bow launches from it.
SpongeBob says: "Oops."
SpongeBob says: "That was a sour note."
Squidward says: "This is not my happiest memory..."
Bubble transition to the Museum.
Squidward says: "Why are we at the Art Museum?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, you love art."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe you'll find a happiest moment in here!"
Squidward says: "Great..."
Squidward says: "I get to see all the art of people who have succeeded where I've failed."
Squidward says: "My art will never be shown in this..."
Squidward says: "What the?"
Squidward says: "This..."
Squidward says: "this is my sculpture!"
Squidward says: "How did it get here?"
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "Your work at a museum, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Gosh!"
Squidward says: "I can't believe it!"
Squidward says: "I think this might be it!"
SpongeBob says: "Your happiest memory?"
Squidward says: "Yeah!"
Squidward says: "Gosh!"
Squidward says: "Fiasco himself is talking about my art!"
Fiasco says: "Ahem!"
Fiasco says: "Squid..."
Fiasco says: "ward..."
Fiasco says: "go toward..."
Fiasco says: "the light..."
Squidward says: "And now he's melted it..."
Squidward says: "Not a happiest memory..."
SpongeBob says: "Um..."
SpongeBob says: "it's kinda smokey in here!"
SpongeBob says: "You need fresh air!"
Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Squidward who is blindfolded in a hot air balloon.
SpongeBob says: "What a majestic view!"
Squidward says: "What view?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "I forgot about your blindfold!"
SpongeBob says: "Isn't it beautiful?"
Squidward says: "afraid of heights!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "I'll take us down!"
Squidward says: "What?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "Oh yeah..."
Squidward says: "nice view..."
Harold says: "All that time and money and resources wasted on..."
SpongeBob says: "Hey!"
SpongeBob says: "We're the first to ever reach the top of Mt."
SpongeBob says: "Bikini!"
SpongeBob says: "Surely that makes for a happiest memory!"
SpongeBob says: "I claim this mountain in the name of Squidward Tentacles!"
Harold says: "Stupid amateurs..."
Squidward says: "Time to face facts."
Squidward says: "I'll never have a happiest memory."
Narrator says: "Two weeks later..."
SpongeBob says: "Gary, I am worried about Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "He hasn't come out of his house for two weeks now!"
Gary says: "meow eow-ow."
SpongeBob says: "I'm okay Gary!"
Gary says: "Meow..."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward sure seems depressed."
SpongeBob says: "I think I'll call him to cheer him up!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Are you there?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
Gary says: "Mrow?"
SpongeBob says: "Gary?"
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing at Squidward's?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh Gare?"
SpongeBob says: "Can you put Squidward on the phone?"
Squidward says: "I just can't seem to get happy..."
Squidward says: "Oh yeah."
Squidward says: "My fax machine."
Squidward says: "Now, why did I buy that again?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, do I smell brownies?"
Squidward says: "Yes..."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "I have to find a way to give Squidward a happiest memory."
SpongeBob says: "These pants may be square, but it's time to think outside the box!"
Squidward says: "You're not SpongeBob."
Mailfish says: "I have a package for a Squidward "Tentaclees"?"
Squidward says: ""Tentacles"."
Squidward says: "Yes that's me."
Mailfish says: "Well, here you go."
Squidward says: "Thanks..."
SpongeBob says: "Surprise."
SpongeBob says: "I figured out you needed a party to help cheer you up."
SpongeBob says: "Unfortunately, everybody I tried to invite was busy or sick, but don't worry, I used my papier mâché skills to fill the party with your favorite person: me!"
SpongeBob says: "So what do you think?"
SpongeBob says: "Happiest memory or what?"
Squidward says: "You don't seem to understand."
SpongeBob says: "So you enjoying the hors d'oeuvres?"
Squidward says: "This is it, my happiest memory!"
SpongeBob says: "Sigh..."
SpongeBob says: "he's so handsome!"
