While SpongeBob sleeps, Gary notices his food bowl is empty. So, he slithers up to the diving board, jumps off, and starts to lick SpongeBob, who giggles and wakes up.
SpongeBob says: "Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing!"
SpongeBob says: "?"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Oh my gosh!"
SpongeBob says: "Your bowl is empty!"
SpongeBob says: "Not to worry, Gare-gare!"
SpongeBob says: "Food is on the way, faster than you can say  organic!"
Gary says: "Meow?"
SpongeBob says: "There you go, Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "Shame on you!"
SpongeBob says: "I realize you're a bottom feeder, but have some manners!"
SpongeBob says: "You know you're not supposed to eat goop off the ground!"
SpongeBob says: "Now go on and enjoy your health food!"
SpongeBob says: "What is this stuff, anyway?"
SpongeBob says: "It doesn't seem to be coming off!"
Patrick says: "Hi, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Eww!"
SpongeBob says: "Something wrong, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "What is that?"
SpongeBob says: "What's what?"
Patrick says: "This!"
SpongeBob says: "P-P-P-Patrick, what should I do?"
Patrick says: "Scratch it like there's no tomorrow!"
SpongeBob says: "Good idea!"
Patrick says: "Uhh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah?"
Patrick says: "I don't know about this!"
SpongeBob says: "What makes you say that?"
Patrick says: "This."
He takes out a mirror and shows SpongeBob that the fungus has spread.
SpongeBob says: "Aah."
SpongeBob says: "That's more like it!"
SpongeBob says: "All better."
SpongeBob says: "See, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Sure do!"
Patrick says: "Well, Probably gonna go sit in my hole."
Patrick says: "Catch ya later, pal."
SpongeBob says: "Bye, Patrick!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hi, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob?"
Squidward says: "Why are you all puffy?"
SpongeBob says: "All what-y?"
Squidward says: "Your skin, SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "What's wrong with your skin?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, that!"
SpongeBob says: "It's nothing really, Squidward… Just a little blemish, that's all."
Squidward says: "That's no blemish!"
SpongeBob says: "Help… Me!"
Squidward says: "Oh, I'll help you, alright!"

S.W.A.T. fish #1 says: "Stop, you fool!"
S.W.A.T. fish #1 says: "You wanna get infected?"
S.W.A.T. fish #1 says: "This is a job for the hazmat physician."
Hazmat physician says: "Get back!"
Hazmat physician says: "I said, get back!"
Hazmat physician says: "Back I say!"
SpongeBob says: "What's going on, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Help!"
Old Man Jenkins says: "Oh, why thank you very much, young man."
Squidward says: "What was that?"
Squidward says: "No, no, Mr."
Squidward says: "Squidward!"
Squidward says: "That can't be the Ick."
Meanwhile, SpongeBob, being completely covered in fungus, is encased in a bubble with tubes coming from it.
SpongeBob says: "Oh..."
SpongeBob says: "Where am I?"
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
Scientist says: "You are home, SpongeBob."
Scientist says: "You just have to stay in this bubble until the Ick clears up."
SpongeBob says: "Where's my snail, Gary?"
Scientist says: "We've taken care of your pet."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Gary?"
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
Hazmat Physician says: "He appears stable, sir."
Scientist says: "Alright, boys, let's pack it up."
The scientists leave, scene cuts to outside SpongeBob's pineapple house, covered in a plastic bag, with police tape and barbed wire around it, with a board written "Quarantine" on it. SpongeBob is filter-feeding, when Patrick walks in.
Patrick says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Stop!"
SpongeBob says: "Stop!"
SpongeBob says: "You're gonna pop it!"
Patrick says: "Really?"
Patrick says: "How about if I squeeze it like this?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "How many times do I have to tell you?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Be careful!"
Patrick says: "Sorry."
Patrick says: "Hey, wanna play a game of pirate wrestling?"
SpongeBob says: "Sure!"
SpongeBob says: "Let's begin!"
SpongeBob says: "Um..."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Patrick says: "I win!"
Patrick says: "I win!"
Patrick says: "I win!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Go, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Go, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Go, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "What am I gonna do?"
SpongeBob says: "My bubble is destroyed."
Patrick says: "I've got an idea!"
SpongeBob says: "There is no time for games, Pat!"
SpongeBob says: "Now think, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands!"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Help!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Help me flip these patties!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We've got growling stomachs out there!"
Squidward says: "No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Mr. Krabs says: "Then would it be too much trouble to ask his high and mightiness to take these patties out to the customers?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh… If only SpongeBob were here."
Squidward says: "If SpongeBob were here, we'd be covered in Ick!"
Nathiel Waters says: "Ahh."
Squidward says: "Stay back, you diseased freaks!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's all the commotion about?"
Unknown Fish says: "The commotion, my dear Krabs, is regarding the hygiene standards of your eating establishment, which would appear to be inadequate."
Mr. Krabs says: "Inadequate!"
Mr. Krabs says: "?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll have you know, the staff of the Krusty Krab take a solemn pledge, to show up every day in a week clean and disease-free."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry I'm late, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "SpongeBob SquarePants, returning for duty, sir."
Everybody turns to SpongeBob in his bubble, who has swollen up to an enormous green circle. He puts on his hat, and squirts green juice inside his bubble. The fish gasp.
Unknown Fish says: "Is that what you consider clean and disease-free, Krabby?"
Unknown Fish says: "I say we ramshack this greasy disease shack!"
Unknown Fish says: "Who's with me?"
All says: "We are!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It wasn't me!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It was Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "He gave you all the Ick!"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "No I didn't!"
Squidward says: "It was SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "He's infected the entire Krusty Krab!"
Unknown Fish says: "Let us apprehend that careless contaminator!"
Gary says: "Meow."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, stop it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're tickling me, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "It's not me, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Gary the Snail!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't you know it's impolite to feed off of other people without permission?"
Mr. Krabs says: "He's just doing his job, SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "He's a bottomfeeder, remember?"
Mr. Krabs says: "See?"
Mr. Krabs says: "The little feller licked me clean!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm cured!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And he'll clean the Ick off any surface!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Even Squid!"
Nat Peterson says: "Oh!"
Nat Peterson says: "Oh!"
Nat Peterson says: "Me next!"
Martha Smith says: "Where are your manners?"
Martha Smith says: "It's ladies first!"
Patrick says: "I believe the expression is starfish first."
Unknown Fish says: "I supersede all of you!"
Unknown Fish says: "For I have an exotic accent."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, hey, hey!"
Mr. Krabs says: "There's no need to fight!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Cause I have a solution I'll be happy with."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now can I get you a Krabby Patty?"
Unknown Fish says: "In the light of today's events, that notion is crass and offensive."
Unknown Fish says: "I'll take two, please."
Mr. Krabs says: "Alright!"
SpongeBob says: "Here you go, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Another 5 dollars for another de-Ickin'."
SpongeBob says: "Look, Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "You made me all sparkly!"
SpongeBob says: "You're the best bottom feeder a sponge could ever have!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Aye, and a great money maker ya are, too."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, back to work!"
