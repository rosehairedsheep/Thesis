The scence cuts to the Bikini Bottom post office.
A mailfish drives a car full of sacks of letters to the post office. After sorting a few letters, he comes across SpongeBob's envelope, which says, "To Vikings" with a heart below the words. He takes the envelope, walks outside, and throws it away. Two men in a garbage truck pull up to the garbage cans. The men play rock, paper, scissors. The man who was driving plays paper, and the other man plays scissors. The driver goes outside, grabs a garbage can, and trips on his own shoe lace. Trash spills everywhere, but SpongeBob's letter lands right in front of the driver. He picks the envelope up, takes one look at it and stands up. The other garbage man knocks on the windshield of the truck, but the driver just runs away. His hat falls off to reveal a Viking helmet. A viking waits at the bus stop with Fred, Old Man Jenkins, and Ms. Shell. Fred, Old Man Jenkins, and Ms. Shell stare at the garbage-scented Viking. a bus drives through sun light, rain, and snow. Meanwhile, the Viking is shown riding a bike. He rides around mountains. Soon, the top of the mountain range is shown.
