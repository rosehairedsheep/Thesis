The episode opens with SpongeBob and Patrick playing in Squidward's yard and annoying him.
Squidward says: "Stop playing..."
Squidward says: "in my yard!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, we're not playing in your yard, Squidward, we're playing in our yards."
SpongeBob says: "We're just using your yard as a walkway."
Patrick says: "No offense, but your yard gargles tartar sauce."
Squidward says: "Well, pick one and leave my yard out of it!"
Patrick says: "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!"
Patrick says: "I'm good at choosing!"
Patrick says: "Hmmmm..."
Patrick says: "let's play in..."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob's yard!"
Patrick says: "No!"
Patrick says: "Patrick's!"
Patrick says: "Errrr..."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"

Back on the surface, Squidward is napping on his couch.
SpongeBob says: "Peek-a-boo!"
SpongeBob says: "I see you!"
Squidward wakes up, fluffs his pillow and goes back to sleep.
SpongeBob says: "You're it!"
Patrick says: "You're it!"
Patrick says: "Knock, knock!"
SpongeBob says: "Who's there?"
Patrick says: "I don't know!"
Squidward says: "Hey, Gary."
Gary says: "Meow."
Squidward says: "Where are those two morons?"
Squidward says: "Where are they?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Ohh..."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, check out these roots!"
Patrick says: "They're dancing!"
SpongeBob says: "Do like the roots do, and do the Dirt Dance, baby!"
Patrick says: "Squidward's house wants to play too!"
Squidward says: "My house!"
SpongeBob says: "Awww."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward's house looks like it has an upset tummy."
Patrick says: "Must've been something it ate."
SpongeBob says: "It ate Squidward!"
Patrick says: "That'll do it."
Squidward says: "I knew you two reprobates were behind this."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "We're reprobates!"
Squidward says: "That was an insult."
Patrick says: "And we're insulted!"
Squidward says: "Why were you digging under my yard?"
SpongeBob says: "You told us not to walk on your yard, so we walked under it."
Squidward says: "But you buried my house!"
Patrick says: "No need to thank us."
Squidward says: "Thank you?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Patrick says: "You're welcome."
Patrick says: "Missed."
SpongeBob says: "Somebody wants to play Tag!"
Patrick says: "Tag!"
Patrick says: "You're it!"
SpongeBob says: "Not it!"
Patrick says: "Whee!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward wins!"
Squidward says: "Now, you're gonna play a new game called, "Digging Out my House!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, boy!"
Squidward says: "And I'm gonna play "Sit and Relax" until you're finished."
SpongeBob says: "Yuh oh!"
Squidward says: "I'm warning you: If you don't put my house back where it belongs by the count of th-ree-  Three."
Squidward says: "I am going to grind you into chum!"
Squidward says: "One!"
Patrick says: "Quick, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Dig for your life!!!"
Squidward says: "Two!"
Patrick says: "He's already at number two!"
Patrick says: "Who knows how many numbers we have until he reaches three?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Squidward says: "Th-ree!"
SpongeBob and Patrick scream. They start digging very fast while Squidward is chasing them, grumbling angrily. Many buildings above ground collapse because of the digging. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab being sunk.
Plankton says: "Yes!"
Plankton says: "Now the Chum Bucket is the only restaurant in town!"
Plankton says: "Nuts."
Squidward says: "You..."
Squidward says: "two..."
Squidward says: "morons..."
Squidward says: "sunk my house!"
SpongeBob says: "We're sorry!"
Patrick says: "We're sorry!"
SpongeBob says: "Good morning, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Another beautiful day under Bikini Bottom!"
Squidward says: "I hate neighbors."
