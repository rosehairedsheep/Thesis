SpongeBob & Patrick are running through Jellyfish Fields laughing trying to capture jellyfish.
SpongeBob says: "The sign!"
Patrick says: "Huh?"
Patrick says: "cliff!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Is the rest of you down there?"
Patrick says: "The rest of me is up here."
SpongeBob says: "Whew, you had me worried there, buddy."
Patrick says: "I find all this laughter to be highly illogical."
SpongeBob says: "Well, let's stop laughin' and let's start fishin'!"
SpongeBob says: "Go ahead, you get first crack."
Patrick says: "Look at them."
Patrick says: "These graceful stoic creatures of the deep."
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Those are some big words, Pat."
SpongeBob says: "I've never heard you use them before."
Patrick says: "Nonsense, my vocabulary is infinitely expanding."
SpongeBob says: "Well, let's expand our jellyfish nets!"
SpongeBob says: "C'mon, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Look, buddy, I captured one!"
Patrick says: "Yes..."
SpongeBob says: "Okay..."
SpongeBob says: "what do you wanna do?"
Patrick says: "Let us go off and admire the beauty and fragility of nature."
SpongeBob says: "Pretty."
Patrick says: "Yes, quite."
SpongeBob says: "Fragile."
Patrick says: "Indeed."
SpongeBob says: "C'mon, Patrick, let's do something fun!"
Patrick says: "Oh, you want to run some statistics or observe phenomenon and render hypothesis of said phenomenon?"
Patrick says: "Doesn't feel like fun."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what's the difference between a guitar and a jellyfish?"
Patrick says: "You can't strum a jellyfish."
SpongeBob says: "Yes!"
Patrick says: "Oh my, look at the time."
Patrick says: "I really must be going."
SpongeBob says: "What's wrong with Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "I sure hope he gets better soon."
SpongeBob says: "Are you better, Pat?"
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, whatcha doing?"
Patrick says: "Just studying this amazing subspecies."
Plankton says: "I'll show you subspecies!"
SpongeBob says: "Wanna visit Squidward?"
Patrick says: "Well, since I am finished with my work, I'll humor you with your trivial pursuits."
Patrick says: "I'd recognize that piece anywhere!"
Patrick says: "Cornelius Pufferfish's Opus 67, "Symphony in Blue."
Squidward says: "Patrick?"
Patrick says: "It's a beautiful piece."
Patrick says: "Execution needs some work."
Patrick says: "May I suggest on the 7th bar of the adagio andante that you add a little fortissimo on the arpeggiated b-flat scale."
Squidward says: "Wow!"
Squidward says: "I never thought to do it like that."
Patrick says: "Well, that is because you rarely think."
SpongeBob says: "How do you know so much about music?"
Patrick says: "A creative outlet provides a spiritual release and helps facilitate a healthy mental balance."
Patrick says: "Ah."
SpongeBob says: "Does that include..."
SpongeBob says: "belch-talk-ing?"
Patrick says: "Mr."
Patrick says: "SquarePants, I find your humor vulgar."
Squidward says: "I had no idea you were so knowledgeable, Patrick!"
Squidward says: "Do you think you can be my musical mentor?"
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, guys?"
Patrick says: "Let's take it from the top."
Patrick says: "Find yourself a new mentor!"
SpongeBob says: "Now that you have some free-time, let's get some grub."
Patrick says: "No, SpongeBob, I'm afraid not."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I have a brand new bottle of super-bubbly bubble soap!"
Patrick says: "No, thanks again."
SpongeBob says: "Well, maybe later we can play pirates."
Patrick says: "Robert, my dear, it's no use."
Patrick says: "We've just grown apart."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "What do you mean?"
Patrick says: "I know we've had fun in the past, but we're just not compatible anymore."
Patrick says: "It's time we went our separate ways..."
Patrick says: "such is life."
SpongeBob says: "But Patrick, you're my best friend!"
Patrick says: "I know it's hard, but brace up, chap."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
Patrick says: "Maybe our paths will cross again someday."
Patrick says: "Think fondly of me, Mr."
Patrick says: "SquarePants."
SpongeBob says: "Goodbye..."
SpongeBob says: "Mr..."
SpongeBob says: "Best friend!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Sandy says: "Well, Pat, the new you gets an A+."
Patrick says: "Why, thank you, Sandra."
Patrick says: "I find your intellect rather stimulating as well."
Sandy says: "Oh, really?"
Sandy says: "Well, thanks."
Sandy says: "Well, Patrick, what do you think about this problem?"
Patrick says: "You simply change the literal term to a coefficient and the minuend will achieve the desired quotient."
Patrick says: "Even the simplest of mammals can figure it out with a little thought."
Sandy says: "What do you mean by that, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "I'm merely suggesting you lack the ability to solve remedial equations."
Sandy says: "Are you suggesting I'm dumb?"
Patrick says: "I'd use a more sophisticated word like 'impaired'."
Sandy says: "I think you'd better leave."
Patrick says: "I was only trying to help."
Sandy says: "I don't need your kind of help, Mr."
Sandy says: "know-it-all!"
Sandy says: "I liked you better when you were a barnacle head!"
SpongeBob says: "I never thought I'd lose my best friend."
SpongeBob says: "How can I compete with geniusness?"
SpongeBob says: "Ohhhhhh!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "Aww, the glory days."
Patrick says: "Why have we grown apart?"
Patrick says: "I must apply all that I know to solve this problem!"
Patrick says: "What?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "I'd do anything to have my old buddy back by my side again!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you're kidnapping me?"
Patrick says: "Yes, I am."
SpongeBob says: "Yay!"
SpongeBob says: "What should we do?"
Patrick says: "We are going to have fun, whatever the cost may be."
SpongeBob says: "Let's do this."
Patrick says: "Yes, let's have some fun."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah!"
Patrick says: "Are you quite sure I found this activity to be fun?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "That was fun, huh Patrick?"
Patrick says: "When did the fun go away, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "It went away when you jumped off that cliff and knocked your head clean off."
Patrick says: "That's it!"
SpongeBob says: "That's what?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what are you doing?"
Patrick says: "I'm going to duplicate my actions from that day to ascertain the origin of my cha..."
Patrick says: "an..."
Patrick says: "nge!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Hold on, buddy!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, your head is back!"
SpongeBob says: "But, uhh, do you feel different?"
Patrick says: "Quite unchanged, actually."
SpongeBob says: "I guess we'll never have fun together again."
Patrick says: "You said you found my dislodged cranial cap last time."
SpongeBob says: "Yes."
Patrick says: "Where exactly did you find it?"
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, it was right here."
Patrick says: "Hmmm, impossible!"
Patrick says: "If I landed here, the trajectory of my dismembered skull would cause it to come to rest, not there, but here, exactly five meters due north."
SpongeBob says: "But if that's your head, then what did I pick up over..."
SpongeBob says: "Here you go, Patrick, your old head."
SpongeBob says: "Are you sure you want to give up being smart and "phosisticated" to be my friend again?"
Patrick says: "Knowledge can never replace friendship."
Patrick says: "I prefer to be an idiot!"
SpongeBob says: "Not just an idiot, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "You're also my pal."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Say something, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Hi, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you're back!"
Patrick says: "Patrick, you're back."
