Squidward is drying off a glass when he looks through the glass and sees SpongeBob wearing boots.
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Do you like my new boots?"
SpongeBob says: "Pretty cool, huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Now, I'm an official fry cook!"
SpongeBob bounces up and down in the boots, making them squeak, as Squidward watches. Then SpongeBob bounces harder until Squidward's head is bouncing up and down really hard trying to keep up. Then SpongeBob leaves to squeak his boots around the Krusty Krab.
Squidward says: "That squeaking is gonna drive us all crazy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Nonsense, Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "That squeaking is money to my ears."
Mr. Krabs says: "I mean, music."
Later that night, Mr. Krabs is in his room, lying in his hammock and imagining dollar bills jumping one-by-one into a cash register like counting sheep.
Squidward says: "That's it, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs; I'm taking my vacation now."
Mr. Krabs says: "What's wrong, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squid-ard?"
Squidward says: "I can't take "The world's greatest fry cook" anymore!"
Squidward says: "I'll see you in a week."
Mr. Krabs says: "That fry cook's making me a fortune."
Mr. Krabs says: "What could be the problem?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-ob."
Mr. Krabs says: "I..."
Mr. Krabs says: "uhh, I see you're still wearing them boots."
SpongeBob says: "Are you kidding?"
SpongeBob says: "I love them!"
SpongeBob says: "Could "The world's greatest fry cook" do this?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, I don't..."
Mr. Krabs says: "uhh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't..."
Mr. Krabs says: "uhh..."
SpongeBob says: "Or could he do this?"
Squeaky Boots says: "May I take your order?"
Incidental 4 says: "Yeah, I'll have the Krusty Special."
Squeaky Boots says: "Thank you, sir."
Squeaky Boots says: "I will squeak when it's ready."
SpongeBob says: "Could "The greatest fry cook" do that, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I, uhh..."
SpongeBob says: "And watch this, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this."
Mr. Krabs says: "Those boots have got to go!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And I need an aspirin."
SpongeBob says: "Gary, these boots have changed my life."
SpongeBob says: "I'm never taking them off."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Good night, Gary."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ah, quiet money."
Mr. Krabs says: "Silence and money."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What is it, my boy?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I'm sorry!"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry!"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's okay, son."
SpongeBob says: "No, it's not okay!"
SpongeBob says: "I lost the boots!"
SpongeBob says: "Your valuable boots, it's my fault, I let you down!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
SpongeBob says: "Ohh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hold it, boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's not the end of the world."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, it is!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Look, don't cry."
Mr. Krabs says: "I got some, uhh, some magic oven mitts!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Poor lad."
Incidental 6 says: "Excuse me?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I didn't do it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ohh, heh-heh, can I help ya?"
Incidental 6 says: "Yeah, I'm ready to order."
Mr. Krabs says: "What'll ya have?"

Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
Incidental 6 says: "And a."
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "The deed is done."
SpongeBob says: "Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Because, lad, you didn't need 'em."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's not the boots, it's the boot-ee."
Mr. Krabs says: "I mean, uh, the person..."
Mr. Krabs says: "in the boots."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're a great fry cook."
SpongeBob says: "You really think so, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I do, son."
Mr. Krabs says: "I need a vacation."
SpongeBob says: "Bye, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ah, a long week away from Bikini Bottom is exactly what I need, just me and my darling daughter Pearl."
Pearl says: "Don't forget my new flipper slippers, Daddy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Darling, I won't."
