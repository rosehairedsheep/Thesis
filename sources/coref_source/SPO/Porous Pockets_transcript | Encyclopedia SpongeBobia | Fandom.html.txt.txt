SpongeBob says: "You know I walk here on Tuesdays."
Patrick says: "Sorry, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "That wasn't me."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I know I heard a terrifying shriek."
Patrick says: "So did I, SpongeBob, but I was just mimicking it."
SpongeBob says: "So, you were mimicking it."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, please don't do that."
SpongeBob says: "It is really..."
SpongeBob says: "Wait a minute, if the shriek wasn’t coming from you, then where was it..."
SpongeBob says: "it’s over there, behind that kelp shrub!"
SpongeBob says: "The terrifying shriek must've come from this clam."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick, I think there's something wrong with..."

Patrick says: "I got the TV remote stuck in my throat!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, this clam is choking!"
SpongeBob says: "Luckily, I come prepared!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, what are you doing?"
SpongeBob says: "They like this!"
Patrick says: "No!"
Patrick says: "You always give a choking victim the Slimelich Maneuver, first!"

Patrick says: "Like this!"
Patrick says: "Ready, clam?"
Patrick says: "Well, SpongeBob, I think I might go catch a movie."
