Sandy says: "You know, SpongeBob, sometimes, it's nice to hang up my hang-glider and just watch the clouds roll by."
SpongeBob says: "Yup, and just relax."
Sandy says: "Yeah."
Sandy says: "Relax."
SpongeBob says: "Ooh!"
SpongeBob says: "Ooh!"
SpongeBob says: "Do you know what that cloud looks like?"
Sandy says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "A flower."
Sandy says: "They all look like flowers, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "All the time."
SpongeBob says: "They sure do."
Sandy says: "You know, normally, I'd offer to race you to the top of coral cliffs."
Sandy says: "But I don't want to miss out on a second of this beautiful beauty."
SpongeBob says: "Me either."
SpongeBob says: "Who wants to get all dirty anyway?"
Sandy says: "Yeah."
Sandy says: "And sweaty."
Sandy says: "Besides, I think we'd all know who'd get to the top first."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
SpongeBob says: "Me."
Sandy says: "Me."
SpongeBob says: "That's funny, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest."
Sandy says: "Course I can!"
Sandy says: "I'm a squirrel."
Sandy says: "See?"
SpongeBob says: "I thought that meant you were nuts."
Sandy says: "Nope, that means I'm a natural born climber."
Sandy says: "I'm from the surface world, and nothing prepares you for climbing than growing up on good ol' dry land."
SpongeBob says: "What do you say to that, "Miss Mittens"?"
Sandy says: "I'd say I'm already halfway there!"
SpongeBob says: "Aaaaah!"
SpongeBob says: "No fair, Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "You got a head start!"
Sandy says: "Sorry, SpongeBob, that's the way the coral crumbles!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey!"
SpongeBob says: "You did that on purpose!"
Sandy says: "Yeah, but this is an accident!"
Sandy says: "Too bad you forgot your umbrella!"
Sandy says: "Well, it's about time you showed up."
SpongeBob says: "But you were..."
SpongeBob says: "I saw you by the..."
SpongeBob says: "I want a rematch!"
SpongeBob says: "First one to the Krusty Krab is the winner!"
Sandy says: "Ain't no way a sea critter can run faster than a land critter."
SpongeBob says: "I can underwater!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm..."
SpongeBob says: "Think you can win a fair race in that clunky tin tube?"
Sandy says: "Why don't you ask my behind!"
Sandy says: "That is, if you can catch it!"
Sandy says: "What do you say to that, HydroPants?"
SpongeBob says: "I'd say I'm already halfway there!"
SpongeBob says: "-halfway there!"
SpongeBob says: "-halfway there!"
SpongeBob says: "-halfway there!"
Sandy says: "Hey!"
Sandy says: "You see?"
Sandy says: "I thought y'all wanted a rematch."
SpongeBob says: "I did!"
SpongeBob says: "And I took a head start like you did!"
Sandy says: "Well, I was just funning with you that time!"
Sandy says: "But I guess all y'all underwater don't have to play fair!"
SpongeBob says: "I guess we don't, air breather!"
Sandy says: "Water sucker!"
SpongeBob says: "Tree climber!"
Sandy says: "Gulf streamer!"
SpongeBob says: "Kite flier!"
Sandy says: "Chum chewer!"
SpongeBob says: "not wet person!"
Sandy says: "Aha!"
Sandy says: "You can't even come up with another name!"
Sandy says: "That proves it!"
SpongeBob says: "Proves what?"
Sandy says: "That land critters are better than sea critters!"
Patrick says: "Better at what?"
Sandy Cheeks says: "Oh, dern near everything, I guess."
Sandy Cheeks says: "Cattle roping and pie eating and wood chopping and flying!"
Squidward says: "What's she blabbering about?"
Patrick says: "She says land creatures are best."
Sandy says: "Only 'cause it's true!"
Sandy says: "We're best at horse riding and fur styling and rowing."
Sandy says: "Y'all got us licked in swimming, but we've got corn shucking Mr."
Sandy says: "Krabs joins the four] and hay bailing and barn raising..."
Sandy says: "and fishing!"
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs all gasp.
Sandy says: "And name calling, for sure!"
Squidward says: "And drowning, don't forget drowning!"
SpongeBob says: "Woo!"
Squidward says: "Not on your life, sport."
SpongeBob says: "I'll admit, you've got some pretty good moves."
SpongeBob says: "For a squirrel."
SpongeBob says: "But you're still just a land creature."
Sandy says: "Squirrels can do anything they want to!"
Patrick says: "I bet they can't eat a Krabby Double Deluxe in one bite."
Patrick says: "Ah."
Patrick says: "Thank you, thank you."
Sandy says: "Well, that's just one thing."
Mr. Krabs says: "Can you do this?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Everyone in my family can do that."
Sandy says: "Uh..."
Sandy says: "uh..."
Squidward says: "How about this?"
Squidward says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Can you reproduce by budding?"
SpongeBob says: "Can ya?"
SpongeBob says: "Can ya?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Can ya?"
Sandy says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "Most importantly..."
SpongeBob says: "can you do this?"
Sandy says: "Well, what would I wanna do any of that dumb stuff for anyway?"
SpongeBob says: "Admit it, Sandy, you can't do anything us sea creatures can do."
SpongeBob says: "In fact, if it wasn't for that suit, you couldn't even live down here!"
Sandy says: "Well, you don't..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Neptune preserve her!"
Squidward says: "How long can she stay like that?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know!"
Patrick says: "Sandy's a girl?"
SpongeBob says: "Wow, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "You sure proved us wrong."
SpongeBob says: "I guess land creatures are better."
SpongeBob says: "At least until they need to breathe..."
SpongeBob says: "Feelin' light-headed yet?"
Sandy says: "Mm-mm."
SpongeBob says: "Remember this?"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's free!"
Sandy says: "Stop laughing at me!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I knew it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "There was no way some "airhead" was gonna win anything against a water breather!"
Patrick says: "Airhead..."
SpongeBob says: "Sea creatures rule!"
Patrick says: "Sea creatures rule!"
Squidward says: "Sea creatures rule!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Sea creatures rule!"
SpongeBob says: "Water!"
Patrick says: "Water!"

Sandy says: "All right, all right!"
Sandy says: "You had your little laugh."
Sandy says: "But now it's my turn!"
Sandy says: "Y'all think you're such hot stuff, don't ya?!"
Sandy says: "!"
Sandy says: "Swimming around with your fancy gills and such."
Sandy says: "But none of you wetheads could last a minute on my turf."
Sandy says: "Dry land!"
Squidward says: "Do we have to wear pickle jars?"
Sandy says: "Nope, nothing but the clothes on your backs."
SpongeBob says: "One minute?"
SpongeBob says: "No problem, Landy!"
Sandy says: "Well?"
Sandy says: "So are you going or not?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, well, uh, uh, um..."
Patrick says: "Uh, well, uh, uh, um..."
Squidward says: "Uh, well, uh, uh, um..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, well, uh, uh, um..."
SpongeBob says: "Actually, you know, but..."
Squidward says: "We can't, uh..."
Squidward says: "because..."
Mr. Krabs says: "We're late for, um..."
Patrick says: "Our fitting!"
Sandy says: "Oh, you mean for your chicken costumes?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, we're not chicken, we'll do it."
SpongeBob says: "There."
SpongeBob says: "Mission accomplished."
Sandy says: "Look."
Sandy says: "Unless you can stay above water for one measly minute, you forfeit the contest and prove that land creatures are better than sea creatures!"
SpongeBob says: "No way, San-day."
SpongeBob says: "We can take on your challenge!"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
Squidward says: "Yeah!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "We're not afraid of your dumb old land!"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
Squidward says: "Yeah!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "We're sea creatures!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
Squidward says: "Yeah!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay..."
SpongeBob says: "Well, this is it."
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait, boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Make it last."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, this isn't so bad!"
SpongeBob says: "We can do this!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick, come on up!"
SpongeBob says: "The air is fine!"
Patrick says: "I'm gonna do it quick and get it over with."
Patrick says: "Cannonball!"
Patrick says: "Hey, I lost my trunks!"
Patrick says: "Hi, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "All right, Pat, you made it!"
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Up here!"
Mr. Krabs says: "All ashore that's going to shore, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Land ho!"
SpongeBob says: "Looking good, Mr."

Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Well, I'll do it."
Squidward says: "But I won't like it."
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, here we are."
Squidward says: "This is pretty easy."
Patrick says: "I may keep a second rock up here!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Once you get your land legs, it's not so bad!"
SpongeBob says: "We're the masters of land and sea!"
Sandy says: "3, 2, 1."
Sandy says: "Well, tan my fur."
Sandy says: "They made it!"
Sandy says: "Better go congratulate 'em."
SpongeBob says: "Uh, thanks for saving us, Sandy."
Sandy says: "You know, everyone's best at something."
SpongeBob says: "But no one's best at everything."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry I made you take off your helmet, Sandy."
Sandy says: "Sorry I made you go up on dry land, SpongeBob."
