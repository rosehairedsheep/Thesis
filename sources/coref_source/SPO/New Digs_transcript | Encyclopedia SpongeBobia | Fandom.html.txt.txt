SpongeBob says: "I'm just going to turn out the lights."
SpongeBob says: "TardyPants!"
SpongeBob says: "You, sir, are a TardyPants!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait 'till Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs finds out."
SpongeBob says: "You better think of something to save your job."

SpongeBob says: "Order up!"
SpongeBob says: "Here you go, sir."
SpongeBob says: "One Krabby Patty, Krabby Fries, and Krabby Drink in three seconds flat."

Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "Please don't throw me out in the street!"
SpongeBob says: "I am so sorry for what I did."
Mr. Krabs says: "What'd you do?"
SpongeBob says: "I was a minute late for work!"
Mr. Krabs says: "A minute late?"
SpongeBob says: "A whole 60 seconds."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, uh, don't do it again."
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "You have to punish me!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, you can clean the salad bar."

Mr. Krabs says: "And goodnight."
SpongeBob says: "I love it here, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Mr. Krabs says: "Sheesh."
Squidward says: "If you love it so much, why don't you just live here?"
SpongeBob grins, getting an idea. Cut to SpongeBob straining to get his feet through a cardboard box he's going to sleep in. He gets his feet through the box and uses napkins as a blanket.
SpongeBob says: "Somethin's not right."
SpongeBob says: "What is it?"
SpongeBob says: "Do I miss my old clock?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What in Neptune's Navy is going on here?"
SpongeBob says: "SpongeBob reporting for duty, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "How long you been here?"
SpongeBob says: "All night, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "All night?"
SpongeBob says: "That's right, I'm going to live here from now on, so I'll never ever be tardy pants again."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hold on!"
Mr. Krabs says: "This ain't no hotel, son."
SpongeBob says: "Here's my first month's rent."
Mr. Krabs says: "Rent?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, let's get ready for the customers."
Mr. Krabs says: "Start scrubbing the grill..."
SpongeBob says: "Already done, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, start cooking some Krabby Patties..."
SpongeBob says: "Done."
SpongeBob says: "All that, before we even open up our doors, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay."
Mr. Krabs says: "Then get cleaned up."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're a mess."
SpongeBob says: "Eww, I guess I could use some freshening up."
Squidward says: "Jammed again."
SpongeBob says: "Ooh."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Squidward."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob?"
Squidward says: "What are you doing here?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I live here now."
Squidward says: "In the dishwasher?"
SpongeBob says: "No, at the Krusty Krab."
SpongeBob says: "Now, if you'll excuse me."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob living at the Krusty Krab?"
Squidward says: "Wait a minute, if he's living here, that means he won't be living next to me."
Mr. Krabs says: "Must be a full moon."
Mr. Krabs says: "Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Just saying goodnight to SpongeBob, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs."
Squidward says: "Sweet dreams, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "You look much more comfier in here than in your old home."
SpongeBob says: "Won't you miss me living next door, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "And when I went home that night, guess what?"
Frankie says: "He wasn't there?"
Squidward says: "Right!"
Squidward says: "And when I woke up in the morning..."
Frankie says: "Can I just get my change?"
Squidward says: "He still wasn't there."
Frankie says: "Come on, man, my change."
Squidward says: "Here you go."
Frankie says: "Yeah, thanks..."
Frankie says: "Oh, real funny, buddy."
Frankie says: "Two socks and a pair of tighty whities."
Squidward says: "Socks and--  What the..."
Squidward says: "?"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, why is your underwear in the cash register?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I had to put them somewhere and my underwear drawer is all filled up with Krabby Patties and the freezer is filled up with my iced snowflake collection."
SpongeBob says: "So I put the cash from the cash register in the pickle jar."
Squidward says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, lighten up, Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "'Tis harmless tomfoolery."
SpongeBob says: "Do you want to know where the mustard is?"
Squidward says: "Ah!"
Squidward says: "Eww."
Squidward says: "Well, he may be twice as annoying at work, but it still beats having him as a neighbor."
SpongeBob says: "Laundry song, la-la-la!"
SpongeBob says: "Sing about your laundry all day long."
SpongeBob says: "La-la-la-la laundry song."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, you can't be hanging your delicates in me customer's faces."
SpongeBob says: "Well, they don't see to mind."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I have a disgusting clientele."
Mr. Krabs says: "Who spend their money freely."
SpongeBob says: "Aye aye, captain."
Mr. Krabs says: "Because I'd hate for a certain living arrangement—"
Mr. Krabs says: "meaning yours—"
Mr. Krabs says: "to interfere with said money spending."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why is your bed in me office?"
SpongeBob says: "It was getting kind of crowded in the kitchen."
SpongeBob says: "So I moved in here."
Mr. Krabs says: "You can't stay in here."
Mr. Krabs says: "These are my private quarters, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "The only play I can escape for solitude during the day."
SpongeBob says: "But I'll only be here at night."
SpongeBob says: "Please, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I won't get in your way."
SpongeBob says: "Please!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, but I'll have to raise your rent."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, thank you, Mr..."
SpongeBob says: "My parents!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Your parents?"

SpongeBob says: "Mom, Dad, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Margaret SquarePants says: "Oh, hello."
