SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "The Krabby Patty is haunted!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Avast, ye patty pirate!"
Mr. Krabs says: "This is no ghost."
Mr. Krabs says: "This is..."

Sheldon J. Plankton says: "I went to college!"
Sheldon J. Plankton says: "Hey!"
Sheldon J. Plankton says: "Let me go!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, I'll let you go, squirt."
Mr. Krabs says: "On a flying saucer!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Back to the Chum Bucket with you!"

Plankton says: "I have something for you."
Plankton says: "I've been keeping it in my secret compartment."

SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "A golden spatula!"
SpongeBob says: "And it's even got my name on it."

Plankton says: "."
SpongeBob says: "A booster seat?"
Plankton says: "Booster seat?"
Plankton says: "Hot dog!"
Plankton says: "I mean, no."
SpongeBob says: "You just want to be friends so you can get your hands on a Krabby Patty!"
SpongeBob says: "And I bet it's not even your birthday tomorrow!"
Plankton says: "Gee, and I thought you were stupid."
SpongeBob says: "You'll never get a Krabby Patty from me!"
SpongeBob says: "Never, never, never, never!"
Plankton says: "Oh, I'll get a Krabby Patty and you're gonna hand-deliver it to me personally!"
Plankton says: "You weak-minded fool!"
SpongeBob says: "Good night, Gary."
Woman in the recording says: "â™ªLetters of the alphabet, A-B-C..."
Plankton immediately realizes this and flips the record around on the other side. It plays the evil music like last time and he laughs. Then he walks through one of SpongeBob's holes and begins his journey. Plankton reads a map that looks like a regular road map, except with a giant brain in the middle of it.
Plankton says: "It should be in here..."
Plankton says: "but where?"
SpongeBob says: "Morning already?"
Plankton says: "I have you now!"
SpongeBob says: "Time for a well-balanced breakfast."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Help!"
Squidward says: "Be quiet, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Help!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "What are you doing?"
Squidward says: "I'm talking to you!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, are you mad?"
Plankton says: "Shut your mouth, you mediocre clarinet player."
Squidward says: "Mediocre?"
Plankton says: "You pretentious, little insignificant artist."
Plankton says: "Your snivelly creations are worth less than a protozoan's waste!"
SpongeBob says: "Something must be wrong with my brain!"
SpongeBob says: "What kind of friend are you?"
Plankton says: "Nonsense."
Plankton says: "You never liked me, anyway."
Plankton says: "You wouldn't even come to my birthday party!"
SpongeBob says: "Get out of my head!"
SpongeBob says: "Leave my brain alone!"
Plankton says: "Never!"
Plankton says: "Never!"
Plankton says: "Toot toot!"
Plankton says: "How about a little take-out?"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "No, never!"
Plankton says: "You are going to hand-deliver it to me personally!"
SpongeBob says: "No, no, no!"
SpongeBob says: "There's no one here."
Plankton says: "Don't remind me."
Plankton says: "Brace yourself, SpongeBob."
Plankton says: "This is my lab!"
SpongeBob says: "I must fight!"
Plankton says: "No, no, no, no."
Karen Plankton says: "Seaweed: 50% Sea, 50% Weed."
Plankton says: "Impressed?"
Plankton says: "Now let's reveal that secret formula."
SpongeBob says: "I just have to say I'm sorry I let Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs down."
SpongeBob says: "you delicate little Krabby Patty."
Plankton says: "Mmm..."
Plankton says: "Steamy..."
SpongeBob says: "I'll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns."
Plankton says: "Yes..."
Plankton says: "yes..."
Plankton says: "yes!"
Karen says: "Plankton: 1% evil, 99% hot gas."
Plankton says: "Well, this stinks."
SpongeBob says: "Well, patty, I guess we can go home now."
Plankton says: "SpongeBob, that's my Krabby Patty!"
Plankton says: "Nooooo!"
Plankton says: "I'll settle for some fries."
