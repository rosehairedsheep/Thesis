Scene begins outside of the Fast Food Coliseum.
Johnny says: "Welcome, sports fans, to the 21st annual Bikini Bottom Fry Cook Games."
Horns are played as Harold the blue spotted fish runs into the stadium, holding a small torch. He runs up the stairs to a huge hamburger.
Harold says: "I declare these Fry Cook Games..."
Harold says: "open!"
Johnny says: "So begin the 21st Fry Cook Games."
Johnny says: "I'm a realistic Fish Head, and it's a beautiful day here at Bikini Bottom's Fast Food Coliseum."
A clip plays showing a woman tossing a large straw into a large plastic cup like a javelin.
Johnny says: "They come from everywhere microwaves hum,  and heat lamps keep the fast food spirit warm..."
Johnny says: "and soggy."
Johnny says: "But the real story is the bitter rivalry between former competitors Mr."
Johnny says: "Krabs of the Krusty Krab and Plankton of the Chum Bucket."
Pictures of both Mr. Krabs and Plankton appear. A clip of Mr. Krabs lifting up two barrels of pickles is shown.
Johnny says: "Who could forget the year Mr."
Johnny says: "Krabs won gold for this five hundred pickle clean-and-jerk?"
Mr. Krabs is shown on a podium on the number one step, while Plankton is below him on the second.
Johnny says: "Not Plankton."
Plankton sprays Mr. Krabs with a hose. A clip of Plankton flipping around while hanging onto two onion rings is shown.
Johnny says: "Or when Plankton won the hearts of millions by performing this perfect onion ring routine..."
Johnny says: "with a broken antenna?"
A cast is around Plankton's left antenna. Plankton is shown in the number one spot on the podium this time, with Mr. Krabs below him.
Johnny says: "Krabs wasn't moved."
Mr. Krabs blows Plankton off the podium.
Johnny says: "And now, late word is that this year, the Krusty Krab will be represented by a new competitor, on what is perhaps the greatest day of his young life."
SpongeBob says: "This is perhaps the greatest day of my young life, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob starts jogging in place.
SpongeBob says: "I can't believe I'm representing the Krusty Krab in the Fry Cook Games."
A spotlight shines down on him and he puts his hand on his heart.
SpongeBob says: "To bring home the gold is to bring honor and glory to the Krusty Krab."
Mr. Krabs says: "And all that free publicity will bring in customers!"
Mr. Krabs says: "So don't lose!"
Mr. Krabs walks away.
SpongeBob says: "Aye, aye, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob starts doing pushups.
SpongeBob says: "Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "Krusty Krab!"
Patrick walks up.
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob stops.
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Patrick."
SpongeBob continues doing pushups.
SpongeBob says: "Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob starts groaning.
Patrick says: "Are you trying to move the ground?"
Patrick says: "You'll never move it like that."
Patrick says: "You gotta get under..."
Patrick says: "â€¦neath it!"
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Patrick, I'm trying to train for the games."
Patrick says: "Games?"
Patrick says: "Can I play?"
SpongeBob says: "Ah, sorry, Patrick."
SpongeBob starts jumping rope.
SpongeBob says: "You have to be a fry cook."
Patrick says: "Be a fry cook?"
Patrick says: "Is that all I gotta do?"
Patrick says: "That'll be easy!"
SpongeBob tosses his jump rope behind him.
SpongeBob says: "What do you mean easy?"
Patrick laughs.
Patrick says: "How hard can it be?"
SpongeBob says: "They don't let just anybody be a fry cook."
SpongeBob says: "We're an elite corp!"
Patrick says: "Oh, come on."
Patrick says: "You're just flippin' patties."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, flipping is not as easy as it sounds!"
Patrick flips a rock over with his foot.
Patrick says: "Tssss..."
SpongeBob says: "Why don't you go home, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "You can compete in the Laying Under a Rock All Day Games!"
Patrick gasps.
Patrick says: "Well, at least I don't polish my fingernails."
SpongeBob gasps and points at Patrick.
SpongeBob says: "You take that back!"
SpongeBob's index finger gleams. Patrick dances around.
Patrick says: "Fingernails!"
Patrick says: "Fingernails!"
Patrick says: "Fingernails!"
SpongeBob says: "You don't even have fingernails."
Patrick says: "I cannot believe what I am hearing!"
SpongeBob says: "How can you hear it?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "You don't have ears either!"
Patrick stutters.
Patrick says: "Holes!"
Patrick says: "Holes!"
SpongeBob says: "Cone head!"
Patrick says: "Yellow!"
SpongeBob says: "Pink!"
Patrick screams and holds his head.
Patrick says: "I'm gonna get a job as a fry cook and it'll be easy!"
Patrick walks off. SpongeBob growls and starts doing pushups again, but this time, he does it faster.
SpongeBob says: "Fine!"
SpongeBob says: "Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "Krusty Krab!"
Mr. Krabs sniffs the air.
Mr. Krabs says: "What's that smell in the air?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I smell Plankton!"
Camera zooms over to Plankton, who is standing in the entranceway of the stadium. Plankton pulls out a human nose from behind him.
Plankton says: "Oh yeah?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Plankton says: "Well, I smell..."
Plankton says: "Pew!"
Plankton says: "He's right."
Mr. Krabs runs over, his feet twinkling. Plankton does the same. Mr. Krabs makes a Broadway pose as corresponding music plays. Plankton makes a similar pose, holding a cane and a top hat. Mr. Krabs plays a piano, while Plankton blows into a tuba, messing up the rhythm.
Plankton says: "I love messing things up."
Plankton meets up with Mr. Krabs by getting on a small platform and pulling a lever, which goes up to Mr. Krabs' height.
Plankton says: "Are you ready to do or die, Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Always ready, Plankton."
Mr. Krabs says: "Always ready."
Plankton says: "Good."
Plankton says: "Because today, the Chum Bucket is going to kick..."
Plankton says: "..."
Plankton says: "your carapace!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's what you think, but I got me a champion-- SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Show him!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Look at him."
Mr. Krabs says: "In his prime."
Mr. Krabs says: "You ain't got no chance!"
Plankton says: "That's where you're wrong, Krabs, for I too have a champion."
Muscular Fish says: "I gotta get outta here!"
Plankton says: "Too late!"
Plankton says: "Ready or not, here he comes."
Plankton says: "Quake with fear, you mortal fools."
Plankton says: "Bow down before the awesome might of..."
Plankton says: "..."
Plankton says: "Patrick Star!"
Patrick waves happily. SpongeBob stares in shock. He walks up as Patrick gets down from the huge fish's back.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what are you doing here?"
SpongeBob says: "You're not a fry cook."
Patrick says: "Oh, yes I am, Mr."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob SuperiorPants."
Patrick says: "Check it out!"
Patrick says: "I've been working for the Chum Bucket for almost five minutes."
SpongeBob says: "Well, it doesn't matter anyway, 'cause you're gonna eat my dust."
Patrick says: "Nuh-uh."
Patrick says: "I'm eating my own dust!"
SpongeBob says: "Not if I eat it first!"
Patrick says: "Yellow!"
SpongeBob says: "Pink!"
The two walk away.
SpongeBob says: "I can't believe it, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I thought Patrick was my friend."
Mr. Krabs says: "Friend?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Not in here, he ain't."
SpongeBob says: "What do you mean?"
Plankton says: "He's not really your friend."
Patrick says: "He's not?"
Plankton says: "He's plotting your downfall right now!"
SpongeBob says: "He is?"
Mr. Krabs says: "He's gonna stab you in the back."
Patrick says: "He wouldn't!"
Plankton says: "Of course he would."
Plankton says: "Just look at him."
Plankton says: "Square: the shape of evil!"
Mr. Krabs says: "He's making a mockery of your profession."
Mr. Krabs says: "Are we gonna let some pretender take away what belongs to the Krusty Krab?"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Plankton says: "Then get mean!"
Patrick says: "I'm mean!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get angry!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm angry!"
Plankton says: "Now get out there!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And win..."
Plankton says: "That..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Medal!"
Huge Fish says: "Ahhh."
Scene cuts to the first event.
Johnny says: "Our first event, the deep fry pole vault."
Mr. Krabs says: "Win this one for the Krusty Krab."
SpongeBob says: "For the Krusty Krab!"
Plankton says: "Win this one because I told you to."
Patrick says: "Because you told me to!"
Lou says: "Fish sticks!"
Lou says: "Get your fish sticks here!"
Scene cuts to the second event. SpongeBob and Patrick are standing in front of a tall ladder that leads to a diving board, perched above a bowl of chocolate syrup.
Johnny says: "The next event: the chocolate high dive."
SpongeBob says: "Make way for the real fry cook, Patrick."
SpongeBob climbs up the ladder.
Johnny says: "For his dive, SpongeBob will be attempting a full banana fudge pop with two sticks."
SpongeBob holds up two popsicle sticks and sticks them into the top of his head.
Johnny says: "And now, absolute silence."
The crowd stops chattering. SpongeBob jumps off the diving board.
SpongeBob says: "I scream for ice cream!"
Johnny says: "Perfect entry!"
Johnny says: "And toasted almonds?"
Johnny says: "That's unexpected."
SpongeBob lands in the circle.
Johnny says: "He stuck it!"
SpongeBob turns around toward the camera and grins.
Johnny says: "And just look at that even coating."
SpongeBob walks upside-down past Patrick, using the popsicle sticks for legs.
SpongeBob says: "Top that, Pinky."
Plankton walks up.
Plankton says: "Almonds?"
Plankton says: "Curse him, that's good."
Plankton says: "But perhaps a bit too highbrow for this crowd."
Plankton says: "He thinks he's better than them!"
Patrick groans.
Plankton says: "Better than you!"
Patrick groans louder.
Plankton says: "Now get up there and show him how the common man prepares his frozen dairy treats!"
Patrick screams, then hops up onto the diving board with the lower half of his body inside an ice cream cone.
Johnny says: "Patrick will be resurrecting an old favorite."
Johnny says: "The single scoop strawberry cone with a chocolate dip."
Patrick slowly leans off the edge until he falls off the diving board.
Johnny says: "Just look at that concentration."
Patrick splashes into the bowl, with chocolate syrup flying everywhere.
Johnny says: "Ooh, a little shaky on that entry."
A live action strawberry cone with a chocolate dip is shown.
Johnny says: "But just look at that form!"
Patrick hops up to SpongeBob grinning while SpongeBob is very angry about losing.
Patrick says: "Take that, yellow boy!"
SpongeBob says: "Laugh while you can, Pinky."
SpongeBob says: "It's not over yet."
Patrick says: "That's what you think, but it's not over yet."
A clip of highlights from the games is shown, beginning with SpongeBob tossing a patty. Patrick skates on a large grill with butter on his feet. Patrick tosses a large bottle of ketchup up in the air. SpongeBob and Patrick race on a track carrying trays full of food; the two fly up in the air on two large spatulas. They both do a dance wearing colorful outfits and fruit hats, Patrick's being 12 and SpongeBob's being 27. The clip ends. A large arena on top of a hamburger is on screen. The realistic Fish Head is still reporting.
Johnny says: "It's not over yet!"
Johnny says: "With the score tied, we go to our final event!"
Johnny says: "Bun wrestling."
Johnny says: "Who will take home the gold?"
Johnny says: "Mr."
Johnny says: "Krabs of the Krusty Krab?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't forget, he called ye yellow."
SpongeBob picks up a metal chain, bites off and chews up the middle of it. He bares his teeth, revealing the metal chain to now be attached to them like braces.
Johnny says: "Or Plankton of the Chum Bucket?"
Plankton says: "Don't forget, he called you pink!"
Plankton hops away. Patrick growls as he picks up a lemon, rips it in half, puts both halves into each of his eyes and screams.
Heavy metal music plays. The bell rings. SpongeBob tears off his blue robe, showing off his extremely large, muscular body. Patrick rips off his own green robe, underneath which he is wearing a business suit. He tears off the business suit, also revealing an extremely large, muscular body. The two dive at each other, screaming, until they collide. They wrestle and continue to wind up in twisted positions. They spin around and wind up wrestling with themselves. They realize this, and dive back at each other. Patrick sits on top of SpongeBob, holding his foot.
Patrick says: "Forget the Chum Bucket."
Patrick says: "This is personal."
Patrick takes off SpongeBob's shoe and licks his foot slowly. SpongeBob screams in agony. The two wrestle again. SpongeBob sits on Patrick's chest and screams as he lifts up a pencil with the eraser side pointing toward Patrick. He slowly brings it down to his name tag and erases the "Pat" in "Patrick", leaving "rick".
Patrick says: "My name's..."
Patrick says: "not..."
Patrick says: "Rick!"
Patrick tackles SpongeBob in a puff of smoke and the two wrestle once more before they stop.
SpongeBob says: "I don't like you!"
Patrick says: "I don't like you more!"
SpongeBob says: "I never liked you!"
Patrick says: "I a thousand times never liked you!"
SpongeBob says: "Pink!"
Patrick says: "Yellow!"
They struggle to push each other until both of their pants rip and fall down. Patrick's underwear is yellow. SpongeBob's underwear is pink.
SpongeBob says: "Yellow?"
Patrick says: "Pink?"
Their eyes start to water.
SpongeBob says: "You do care!"
Patrick says: "You do care!"
They both start crying and hug each other.
SpongeBob says: "Let's promise never to fight again, buddy."
Patrick says: "Yeah, pal."
Patrick says: "Let's go home."
The two friends walk off whistling and holding hands. The crowd boos. Mr. Krabs runs up.
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Where ya going?"
Plankton runs up next to Mr. Krabs.
Plankton says: "Get back here and kill each other!"
SpongeBob and Patrick exit the stadium, with arms on each other's backs.
Patrick says: "You're my best friend ever."
SpongeBob says: "You too, Patrick."
Patrick says: "You know, these were white when I bought 'em."
