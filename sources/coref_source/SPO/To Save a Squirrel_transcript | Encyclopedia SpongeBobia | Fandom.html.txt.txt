SpongeBob and Patrick are screaming.
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
Patrick says: "Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
Patrick says: "Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
Patrick says: "Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
Patrick says: "Sandy!"
Sandy says: "What the?"
Sandy says: "Whoa there!"
Sandy says: "Calm down!"
Sandy says: "Now, tell me what happened."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob and I are being chased by a savage beast!"
SpongeBob says: "And it's gonna eat us!"
Sandy says: "Oh, no it ain't!"
The little cricket in an air helmet shows up.
SpongeBob says: "There it is!"
Patrick says: "There it is!"
Sandy says: "Aahh, let's get you back home you little fella!"
Sandy says: "There you go!"
Sandy says: "See, that wasn't nothing to be afraid of, huh guys?"
SpongeBob and Patrick cry.
Sandy says: "I don't have time for this, I'm late for my survival training camp."
SpongeBob says: "Survival training camp?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick and I love camping!"
Patrick says: "Can we come?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Sandy says: "This is ain't no ordinary camping trip, I go out into the wild, armed only with my bare hands, my quick wits, this harpoon, and 65 pounds of dynamite."
Sandy says: "Out in the wild, it's eat or be eaten."
Sandy says: "You have to be willing to do anything when you're alone in the wild."
Sandy says: "You two wouldn't last a single day!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey!"
Patrick says: "Would so!"
SpongeBob says: "We'll have you know that just the other day, Squidward commented at our survival skills!"
Squidward says: "You two are harder to get rid of than cockroaches!"
SpongeBob says: "Thank you, Squidward!"
SpongeBob and Patrick walk away.
Out of the Daydream.
Sandy says: "No way, guys!"
Sandy says: "This is a serious trip for hard-core survivalists only!"
SpongeBob says: "But, Sandy..."
Patrick says: "But, Sandy..."
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "!"
Sandy says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "Ohhh..."
Patrick says: "Ohhh..."
SpongeBob says: "Sshhh!"
SpongeBob says: "We'll show Sandy we're tough as she is!"
SpongeBob says: "That was a close one Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "We were almost left in the wilderness..."
SpongeBob says: "without Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "And nobody would have known where to find us!"
Patrick says: "Weird."
Patrick says: "There's a door back here too?"
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay Patrick, we're all set!"
SpongeBob says: "We have fresh water, a rugged tent for shelter..."
Patrick says: "And a nice fire to keep us warm."
SpongeBob says: "Say, where did you get the firewood?"
SpongeBob says: "Whew!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh-oh, well, we burned our food, ruined our tent, and lost all our water."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, we are going to need to use our razor-sharp quick wits if we're going to make it out of here alive!"
Patrick says: "Gotcha."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "Here's the plan..."
Patrick says: "Oh."
Patrick says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no."
Patrick says: "You made the last decision."
Patrick says: "It's my turn."
SpongeBob says: "Sure Patrick, what do you think we should do?"
Patrick says: "Um..."
Patrick says: "maybe,..."
Patrick says: "uh..."
SpongeBob says: "Uh, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Oh, for crying out loud, SpongeBob, I didn't rush you when it was your turn!"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, sorry, take your time."
Patrick says: "Uhhh..."
Patrick says: "Oh shoot!"
Patrick says: "I forgot what I was going to say!"
SpongeBob says: "No hurry Patrick."
Patrick says: "Do you wanna go play hide and go-seek?"
SpongeBob says: "Sure."
SpongeBob says: "Let's go play in that cave over there."
They go to the cave.
SpongeBob says: "I like it here."
SpongeBob says: "It's rooooooomy, and best of all, we have this cave all to ourselves."
Strange Voice says: "Ahh, hoo-heeheeheeheeheehee."
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Nice."
SpongeBob says: "We'll only stay here tonight, and head home tomorrow."
Old Cave Fish says: "Home?"
Old Cave Fish says: "This is your new home."
Old Cave Fish says: "You'll be here forever just like me!"
Patrick says: "Aahh, good times."
SpongeBob says: "What do you mean we'll be here forever?"
SpongeBob says: "How long have you been here?"
Fish says: "40 years I've been here."
Fish says: "There's ain't no way out of this valley."
Fish says: "You're stuck in here' with me for the rest of your lives!"
SpongeBob says: "We'll be here forever?"
SpongeBob says: "We're doomed!"
Patrick says: "Are you kidding?"
Patrick says: "That old coot's been here for years!"
Patrick says: "Look at him: he's in great shape!"
Patrick says: "Look at his muscular arms, his rock-hard abs, and a great complexion, why, he's glowing with health."
SpongeBob says: "You're right Patrick, but what will we eat, where will we sleep?"
Patrick says: "I don't know about you, but I've got all the comforts of home right here."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick's right."
SpongeBob says: "If I'm stuck here, I should make the best of it."
SpongeBob says: "I'll build myself a new home."
SpongeBob says: "comfy, safe and sound in my own little home."
Cave Fish says: "Safe?"
Cave Fish says: "You're never safe out in the wild!"
Cave Fish says: "If I were you, I'd keep an eye on that big fella."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Do'h!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick is my best friend!"
SpongeBob says: "He wouldn't hurt me."
Cave Fish says: "He's a big boy!"
Cave Fish says: "Just wait 'til when he gets hungry!"
Cave Fish says: "Out here, it's eat or be eaten!"
SpongeBob says: "He's got the taste of flesh!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Sounds like you're hungry."
Patrick says: "Oh, boy, am I!"
Patrick says: "I'm ssoooooo hungry, I could eat anything!"
Patrick says: "I could eat an entire sponge..."
Patrick says: "..."
Patrick says: "cake."
Patrick says: "I was just going to share my golden sponge cake with him."
Patrick says: "It has delicious cream filling too!"
SpongeBob says: "It's all true!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick is going to eat me!"
SpongeBob says: "What should I do?"
Cave Fish says: "You've got to protect yourself!"
Cave Fish says: "What you need is a fort!"
SpongeBob says: "This mud replica of the Krusty Krab should protect me from that fiend Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "I need some real food!"
Cave Fish says: "Remember, kid, it's eat or be eaten."
SpongeBob says: "Yyyess!"
SpongeBob says: "Yyeess!"
SpongeBob says: "I shall eat Patrick before he eats meee!"
Patrick says: "Something smells good."
Patrick says: "What are you cooking, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm gonna cook you up and eat ya!"
Patrick says: "Why do you want to eat me?"
SpongeBob says: "I know what you're doing, you're playing dumb, but it won't work, because I'm going to eat you before you eat me!"
Patrick says: "Well, not if I eat you first!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, no you don't!"
SpongeBob says: "Warm water?"
Patrick says: "You seemed kinda tense, so I drew you a hot bath."
SpongeBob says: "Ah, thanks, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "I did get a trifle unhinged, didn't I?"
Patrick says: "Oops, I forgot the bathbeads!"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "You're a real pal!"
Patrick says: "I was not!"
Patrick says: "It was supposed to be stew!"
Patrick says: "Whew!"
Patrick says: "I'm getting tired."
SpongeBob says: "Why don't you take a nap on this nice, soft bed?"
SpongeBob says: ", and what's a little blanket without a little ketchup?"
Patrick says: "This isn't a bed!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Come back!"
SpongeBob says: "You're not properly seasoned!"
Patrick says: "Give me that ketchup back!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob and Patrick fight over the ketchup bottle, and cover each other with ketchup.
SpongeBob says: "Gotcha!"
Patrick says: "No, got you!"
SpongeBob says: "I got you!"
Cave Fish says: "Congratulations!"
Cave Fish says: "You did it!"
SpongeBob says: "Did what?"
Patrick says: "What?"
Cave Fish says: "Why, earned your survivalist medals, a'course!"
Cave Fish says: "Only a hardcore survivalist would break down and nearly eat his best pal!"
Patrick says: "Why do you care if we're survivalists?"
Cave Fish says: "Cause I'm not just some old hermit."
Sandy says: "I'm  Sandy Cheeks!"
Sandy says: "Survivalist extraordinaire!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy?"
Patrick says: "Sandy?"
Sandy says: "It weren't no accident that you fell out of my truck, I was just testing your survival skills."
SpongeBob says: "You planned this?"
Patrick says: "You planned this?"
Sandy says: "Yup."
Sandy says: "And I'm happy to say you both passed!"
Sandy says: "Here's your survivalist medals!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "It's great that we've won our medals, but I'm still hungry."
Patrick says: "Me too."
Sandy says: "Guys?"
Sandy says: "What'cha doing?"
Sandy says: "Aah, fellas?"
SpongeBob says: "Eat or be eaten!"
Patrick says: "Eat or be eaten!"
Sandy says: "Uh-oh!"
Sandy says: "Next time, I'll bring more granola!"
