Narrator says: "Ah, Sandy Cheeks is going out of town and has asked SpongeBob and Patrick to do a little pet-sitting for her."
Patrick says: "Pet-sitting?"
Patrick says: "Won't that hurt them?"
Narrator says: "Perhaps she should have asked someone else."
SpongeBob says: "Gee, Patrick, I didn't know you spoke bird."
Patrick says: "No, that's Italian, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "Okay boys, this here is Birdy's food."
Sandy says: "Feed him twice a day."
SpongeBob says: "This whole sack?"
Sandy says: "No, just a cup's worth."
Sandy says: "He's saying hello to you."
Sandy says: "Ain't he cute?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh sorry, I don't speak Italian."
Sandy says: "And this here's Snakey."
SpongeBob says: "What's that lump in its belly?"
Sandy says: "Well, that's his dinner."
Sandy says: "See you guys in a couple of days."
SpongeBob says: "Bye, Sandy!"
Patrick says: "Bye, Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "You forgot about this pet!"
Sandy says: "Oh, that's only Wormy."
Sandy says: "He don't eat much."
SpongeBob says: "Look at him Patrick, isn't he great?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, little fella."
Patrick says: "Kitchie-kitchie koo, koo."
SpongeBob says: "Aw look, isn't he just precious?"
SpongeBob says: "Let's take him out to play."
Patrick says: "You found me."
SpongeBob says: "There you are!"
Patrick says: "There you are!"
Patrick says: "Gee, SpongeBob, I don't want today to end ever."
SpongeBob says: "I know, Patrick, days like today only come once, maybe twice in a lifetime."
SpongeBob says: "Savor every moment."
SpongeBob says: "And it's all thanks to Wormy."
SpongeBob says: "I made this for Wormy."
SpongeBob says: "Until tomorrow, new best friend."
SpongeBob says: "Don't be sad, little buddy."
SpongeBob says: "We'll be back first thing in the morning for frolic and fun."
Patrick says: "Why must the sun set on this perfect day?"
Patrick says: "Sleep well, Wormy."
SpongeBob says: "Aw, don't be sad, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "It's only until tomorrow."
SpongeBob says: "Here I come, Wormy!"
Patrick says: "Me, too!"
Patrick says: "And then we're gonna play tag, and then we're gonna color, and then we're gonna build a house of cards!"
SpongeBob says: "We're back, Wormy!"
Patrick says: "We're back, Wormy!"
SpongeBob says: "Wormy, Wormy?"
Patrick says: "Wormy, Wormy?"
Patrick says: "Wormy?"
Patrick says: "Where's Wormy?"
Patrick says: "What's that thing?"
SpongeBob says: "He's gotta be in here."
Patrick says: "He left his "Best Friend" ribbon behind!"
Patrick says: "What is that thing?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "But whatever it is..."
SpongeBob says: "it must've eaten Wormy!"
Patrick says: "WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING TO ME?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Quick, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "We've gotta make a run for the door!"
Patrick says: "Now what?"
Patrick says: "We're trapped in here with that..."
Patrick says: "that..."
Patrick says: ""Best Friend Eater!"
SpongeBob says: "Let's not panic."
SpongeBob says: "We just have to stick together."
SpongeBob says: "Remember, it's two against one."
SpongeBob says: "Right, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you're alive!"
Patrick says: "I am?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, we can't leave this horrible monster in Sandy's house."
SpongeBob says: "It might eat Sandy's other pets!"
Patrick says: "Or worse, it might eat Sandy's pets."
SpongeBob says: "No, it might eat Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "We've gotta get it out of here!"
We see SpongeBob and Patrick hiding behind Sandy's table and Sandy's phone in a jar to trap the butterfly and the phone begins to ring.
Patrick says: "It's for you!"
SpongeBob says: "It's working."
SpongeBob says: "It’s gonna answer it."
Patrick says: "Tartar sauce."
Then we see Patrick on a plate with an apple in his mouth.
SpongeBob says: "You look pretty appetizing, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Now, just stay here and wait for the monster."
SpongeBob says: "I'll go get the net."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Hurry up with that net!"
SpongeBob says: "Hold on, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "I really don't taste that good, Monster."
SpongeBob says: "I'm coming, Patrick!"
Squidward says: "Okay, hold still."
Patrick says: "It's gonna eat Squidward and Mr."
Patrick says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Hit the deck, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Squidward says: "Say "money."
Mr. Krabs says: ""Money!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's the meaning of this, SpongeBob?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "We're in serious danger."
SpongeBob says: "There's a-a-a..."
SpongeBob says: "a monster out there."
Mr. Krabs says: "Is it a paying customer?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh no, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "It doesn't want to eat Krabby Patties."
SpongeBob says: "It wants to eat you!"
Patrick says: "Just like it ate Wormy!"
Squidward says: "Um, Wormy?"
SpongeBob says: "Why?"
SpongeBob says: "Why?"
SpongeBob says: "He was so young."
Patrick says: "We’ll never forget you, Wormy."
Squidward says: "Well, if Moron Theater's over, I think I'll just take a look at this "monster."
Squidward says: ""  That's the monster?"
Patrick says: "Pretty scary, huh?"
SpongeBob says: "A living nightmare!"
Squidward says: "I should have known."
Squidward says: "Well, that's it."
Squidward says: "I'm getting off the Looney Express."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now just 'cause you swabs never seen a creature like this doesn't mean it's dangerous."
SpongeBob says: "We tried to warn them."
SpongeBob says: "I can't watch."
Squidward says: "Get a load of the scary monster."
Squidward says: "Monster."
Mr. Krabs says: "Aww, it looks harmless..."
Squidward says: "It's kinda cute."
Mr. Krabs says: "It reminds me of money!"
Squidward says: "Monster."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
Patrick says: "Mr."
Patrick says: "Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "That flying monster has eaten three friends too many."
SpongeBob says: "We must inform the citizens!"
SpongeBob says: "Evil has surfaced."
SpongeBob says: "The faith of Bikini Bottom is in our hands, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Now let's roll."
Patrick says: "Aye-aye, captain."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Patrick, this is a very delicate situation."
SpongeBob says: "It must be treated with great care and sensitivity."
Patrick says: "Gotcha."
SpongeBob says: "Run, everybody, run!"
Patrick says: "Hey!"
Patrick says: "Monster on the loose!"
SpongeBob says: "Monster!"
Patrick says: "Attention, Bikini Bottom!"
Patrick says: "There's a flying monster that's going to eat you!"

Sandy says: "Shoot!"
Sandy says: "Looks like a twister hit this place."
Sandy says: "Where is everybody?"
Sandy says: "Howdy, SpongeBob."
