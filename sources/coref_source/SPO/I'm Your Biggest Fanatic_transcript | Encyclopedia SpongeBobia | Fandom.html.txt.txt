SpongeBob says: "Kevin the Sea Cucumber!"
Patrick says: "What's so great about a nerdy pickle?"
SpongeBob says: "If I could just touch the hem of his pocket protector, then maybe some of his greatness would rub off on me."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, as a friend, I must say that's really geeky."
Guard says: "Hey!"
Kevin C. Cucumber says: "Bamboo?"

Kevin says: "Doesn't that hurt you?"
Kevin says: "That is the best!"
Kevin says: "This guy's great!"
Kevin says: "We have got to bring this guy jellyfishing with us!"
Anchovy Jellyspotter says: "No, Kevin, no."
Anchovy Jellyspotter says: "He's a geek."
Kevin says: "Look, I won't let the guy join the club."
Kevin says: "I just want to see how many times he can get stung before he goes running home like a baby."
Anchovy Jellyspotter says: "Meep-meep, Kevin's a genius."
Kevin says: "Hey, kid."
Kevin says: "how would you like to try out for the Jellyspotters?"
SpongeBob is on a hospital bed.
Doctor says: "Clear."
Kevin says: "Ah, nothing like driving through Jellyfish Fields with the top down, eh, Jellyspotters?"
Kevin says: "I hope you didn't forget our nets."
SpongeBob says: "I didn't forget them, Kevin."
SpongeBob says: "They're in the trunk."
SpongeBob says: "..."
Kevin says: "Hold it!"
Kevin says: "Before you become a Jellyspotter, you have to pass a rigorous test."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, I caught one!"
SpongeBob says: "Am I a Jellyspotter now?"
Jellyspotters says: "Meep, he caught one."
Kevin says: "Uh, that doesn't count."
Anchovy Jellyspotter says: "Wah-wah-waaaaah!"
Kevin says: "I meant two jellyfish!"
Jellyspotters says: "Two jellyfish, meep, in the net."
Kevin says: "Th-That's not what I meant!"
Kevin says: "I meant 20 jellyfish!"
Kevin says: "Ooh-ooh-ow!"
Kevin says: "Ooh!"
Kevin says: "Ow!"
Kevin says: "Jellyspotters allow jellyfish to eat jelly off their face."
SpongeBob says: "Who wants to lick my cheeks?"
SpongeBob says: "I see I have some takers!"
Kevin says: "How does it feel?"
SpongeBob says: "It tickles my nose!"
Kevin says: "Not for long."
Anchovy Jellyspotter says: "Wah-wah-waaaaah!"
Kevin says: "Will you cut that out?!"
Kevin says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Am I in the Jellyspotters now?"
Kevin says: "No!"
Kevin says: "But I have many more tests for you to take!"
SpongeBob says: "Am I in the Jellyspotters now?"
Kevin says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Am I in the Jellyspotters now?"
Kevin says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Now?"
Kevin says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Now?"
Kevin says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Now?"
Kevin says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "Now?"
Kevin says: "Okay, SquarePants, it is your turn to get zapped!"
Kevin says: "I mean..."
Kevin says: "are you ready for your final test?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm ready!"
Kevin says: "You'd better be, because we're going to capture a queen jellyfish."
SpongeBob says: "A queen?"
SpongeBob says: "Can I help?"
Kevin says: "Oh, don't worry."
Kevin says: "We can't do it without you!"
SpongeBob says: "This is fantastic!"
SpongeBob says: "I've never been bait before!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't think I've ever seen a queen jellyfish either."
Kevin says: "Well, then you've probably never used a queen jellyfish call."
Kevin says: "Why don't you try it out?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, I've heard this call before."
Kevin says: "I'll bet you have."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, where are you going?"
Kevin says: "Oh, don't worry, we'll be right behind this bush."
SpongeBob says: "This is great!"
SpongeBob says: "When I pass this test, I'll be an official jellyfish spotter!"
SpongeBob says: "Kevin!"
Kevin says: "That's right!"
Kevin says: "You should have seen the look on your face when we zapped you!"
SpongeBob says: "But..."
SpongeBob says: "What about my final test?"
Kevin says: "Did you think we'd actually let you into the Jellyspotters?"
SpongeBob says: "But, Kevin, I was your biggest fan!"
Kevin says: "So were they."
Guy says: "Hey, look, everybody."
Guy says: "Kevin's back!"
Kevin says: "You looked so dumb with your dorky jellyfish call!"
SpongeBob says: "I am not a loser!"
Kevin says: "Loooooser!"
Kevin says: "Cnidaria rex!"
SpongeBob says: "King Jellyfish!"
Kevin says: "Kissy face!"
Jellyfish King says: "Huh?"
Kevin says: "I think he's gone."
Kevin says: "One of you, go out and check."
Jellyspotters says: "Meep!"
Jellyspotters says: "Save us!"
Jellyspotters says: "Meep, Kevin, save us!"
Kevin says: "Don't look at me!"
Kevin says: "I was just in this for the fashion!"
Kevin says: "Help me, mommy!"
Kevin says: "Help me!"
Kevin says: "I want my blankie!"
Kevin says: "I want my blankie!"
Jellyfish King says: "What the?"
Kevin says: "I can't believe it!"
Kevin says: "How did you know?"
SpongeBob says: "Everybody loves pie!"
Anchovy Jellyspotter says: "Wah-wah-waaaaah!"
Kevin says: "Well, SquarePants, that was impressive, but you're still not in the club because you didn't catch a queen jellyfish."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, I didn't know this was a hat!"
Kevin says: "It wasn't..."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Hi, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Did you get into that club?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, but I turned them down."
SpongeBob says: "It's not about Kevin, it's about jellyfish!"
Patrick says: "Well, SpongeBob, I'm glad you learned your lesson."
Patrick says: "C'mon, Jeffrey."
