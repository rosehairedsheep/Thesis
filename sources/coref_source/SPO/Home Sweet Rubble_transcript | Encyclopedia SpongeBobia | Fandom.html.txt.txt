SpongeBob says: "Hurry, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know how much longer I can hold this!"
Sandy says: "Cheeks residence."
Patrick says: "Sandy, don't hang up!"
Sandy says: "What do you want?"

Patrick says: "How about you?"
Sandy says: "Oh, you know."
Sandy says: "A little of this, a little of that, A little vacuuming..."
Sandy says: "That sure don't sound like nothing."
Sandy says: "What's all the ruckus?"
Patrick says: "Oh, SpongeBob's pineapple is rotting and falling apart all around us..."
Patrick says: "and we're doomed."
Sandy says: "I'll be right over!"
Patrick says: "Oh, take your time..."
SpongeBob says: "Holding steady, Patrick."

Sandy says: "This place sure went to pot, quick."
Sandy says: "Knockity knock, SpongeBob."

Mr. Krabs says: "And, Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I expect more from you."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, actually, no..."

SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "Will you help?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I suppose I could join the cause."
Mr. Krabs says: "But, it'll have to be our standard deal."
SpongeBob says: "A week of my wages per hour?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You got it, kiddo."

Mr. Krabs says: "Oh."
SpongeBob says: "Um..."
SpongeBob says: "excuse me, everyone?"
SpongeBob says: "Not to micromanage or anything, but do any of you actually know how to build a pineapple?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Sandy says: "Well, of course we do, silly."
Sandy says: "Firstly, every pineapple needs a solid foundation to keep it firmly in place..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Not exactly, Miss Cheeks."
Mr. Krabs says: "A pineapple needs to be mobile, with a strong hull attached in case you need to skip town unexpectedly."
Patrick says: "Wrong!"
SpongeBob says: "Those are all very great ideas, but..."
Sandy says: "But, arguing ain't gonna get this pineapple fixed."
Sandy says: "Good point!"
Sandy says: "Okay, fellas!"
Sandy says: "From now on, we incorporate everyone's ideas."
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah!"
Sandy says: "First thing you gotta do is clean out all this old junk."
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, my furniture is perfectly fine."
Mr. Krabs says: "Heads up!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Careful, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "I thought I'd install a grill in your TV room for those nights where you have to bring work home with you."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, but I like to watch TV in my TV room."
Sandy says: "Well, this ain't the TV room, anymore."
Sandy says: "This is your indoor garden."
SpongeBob says: "But, the sofa goes there."
Sandy says: "Oh, I know."
Sandy says: "But, isn't this better?"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Gary, do you ever feel like you are not being listened to?"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, we need to talk."
Sandy says: "About these columns?"
Sandy says: "Nice, huh?"
Sandy says: "Gives the pineapple an intellectual flavor."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, but I kind of liked my pineapple the way it was."
Sandy says: "Sorry, buddy."
Sandy says: "I-I can't understand you."
Sandy says: "You've got something in your mouth."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ho ho, kiddo."
Mr. Krabs says: "Look out."
Mr. Krabs says: "Just applying some plaster stucco exterior here."
SpongeBob says: "I guess what I'm trying to say is there's nothing wrong with a pineapple that looks like a pineapple."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, no, Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "I still haven't fed you."
Patrick says: "It's just not a house without a rock to sleep under."
Sandy says: "Well, what do you think, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "It's, uh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes?"
SpongeBob says: "It's, uh..."
Sandy says: "Fantastic?"
SpongeBob says: "It's, uh..."
Patrick says: "I'm hungry."
SpongeBob says: "You all worked very hard."
Mr. Krabs says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Patrick says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Sandy says: "Yee-haw!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And, since you're such a satisfied customer, I only charged you double."
Sandy says: "Good job, fellers!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Good work, boy!"
Patrick says: "I'm starving."
SpongeBob says: "Well, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "Here it is."
SpongeBob says: "Our new home."
SpongeBob says: "Gary, where's the sink?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Gary, I don't think that was the sink."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for the futuristic bathroom, Sandy."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Well, this isn't exactly home sweet pineapple, but I suppose it could be much worse."
SpongeBob says: "We still a roof over our heads and food on the table."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, that reminds me!"
SpongeBob says: "You still haven't eaten today, have you?"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "You must be famished."
Gary says: "Meow."
Squidward's tentacles slip through the holes in the walls. He unravels as the stucco falls off the house, revealing the rotten exterior, and everything begins falling apart again.
Squidward says: "Ah!"
Squidward says: "I'm unraveling!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "There's only one thing left to do:  Hello, operator."
SpongeBob says: "City hall, please, Office of Broken Dreams."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Gary, I'm sorry."
SpongeBob says: "With all this house ruckus, I completely forgot to feed you."
SpongeBob says: "Here you go, buddy."
