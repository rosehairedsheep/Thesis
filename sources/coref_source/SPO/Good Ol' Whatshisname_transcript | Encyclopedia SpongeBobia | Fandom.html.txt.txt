Mr. Krabs is laughing in his office as he is reading a book. SpongeBob and Squidward show up.
SpongeBob says: "Exciting reading, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh."
Mr. Krabs says: "You betcha, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "Listen to this."
Mr. Krabs says: "Individuation of the end user will substantially broaden the probability of multiple subsequent visits, generating an inverse negative revenue margin of three quarters of a half of one percent: meaning if you call the customers by their name, they keep coming to spend more of their green backs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "So I want you two to learn the names of every customer."
Squidward says: "I have an important life to live, and it doesn't include chattering with you two ninnies."
Mr. Krabs says: "I thought you might say that, so I decided to turn this into a contest."
Mr. Krabs says: "The employee who learns more names wins this."
Squidward says: "A tropical getaway?"
Squidward says: "On the triple decker Con-huge-go cruise liner?"
Squidward says: "Sunbathing—"
Squidward says: "Parcheesi—"
Squidward says: "ballroom dancing!"
Squidward says: "This is going to be so easy."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob doesn't realize that I'm the face of The Krusty Krab."
Squidward says: "While he's isolated in the kitchen all day, I'll be out here, building a rapport with the customers."
Squidward says: "Hello."
Evelyn says: "Since when do you give two shrimps about customer service, Mr."
Evelyn says: "Grouchy Squidguy?"
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Sally!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Sadie!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Shubie!"
Squidward says: "How does SpongeBob know all these names?"
SpongeBob says: "Right back at you, Lenny!"
Squidward says: "Hey, SpongeBob, could you take a look in the cash register?"
Squidward says: "I think it's broken."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, sure, Squidward."
Squidward says: "I think you might need a closer look."
Squidward says: "Let me give you a hand."
SpongeBob says: "I can't see anything in here, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Keep looking, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Keep on looking."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Thaddeus!"
Squidward says: "Goodbye, SpongeBob."
Gus says: "Good day, young sir!"
SpongeBob says: "Gus!"
Gus says: "He's right!"
Gus says: "This guy's so good, you should give him a prize."
Squidward says: "How in Neptune's creation do you know all these names, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I simply compile the name of every customer in this book."
Squidward says: "And your name is—"
Squidward says: "Suzie Fish, correct?"
Incidental 7 says: "Yes, and you'd also be correct in saying you ruined my food with your sweat, you nitwit!"
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs!"
Squidward says: "That's the last customer."
Squidward says: "Do I win?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, well, actually, I wasn't keeping score."
Mr. Krabs says: "But I'll just say that you and SpongeBob are neck and neck."
Mr. Krabs says: "That mystery guy over there will be the tie breaker."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, that's-- that's-- I know him."
SpongeBob says: "It's-- something."
Mr. Krabs says: "He's the ticket to your prize."
Squidward says: "Uh, so, what's your name?"
What Zit Tooya says: "What's it to ya?"
Squidward says: "Uh, it's just that I was going to—"
Squidward says: "enter your name in our sweepstakes!"
Squidward says: "So, what should I put down?"
What Zit Tooya says: "First and last name?"
Squidward says: "Sure."
What Zit Tooya says: "Yeah, why don't you write this on your form."
Squidward says: "Uh, sir, you forgot your soda."
What Zit Tooya says: "I didn't order any soda."
Squidward says: "It's on the house."
What Zit Tooya says: "What the barnacles are you doing?!"
What Zit Tooya says: "!"
Squidward says: "Oh, I'm sorry, I slipped."
Squidward says: "Here, let me get that off of you."
Squidward says: "Okay, there must be a name tag or some form of I."
Squidward says: "D."
Squidward says: "in here."
Squidward says: "Hey, look up in the sky!"
Squidward says: "A giant meteor is hurtling towards Earth."
What Zit Tooya says: "Where?"
Squidward says: "Oh, you'll see it, just keep looking."
What Zit Tooya says: "I can't see it."
Squidward says: "Well, that's too bad, because I found what I was looking for."
What Zit Tooya says: "Hey!"
What Zit Tooya says: "Come back here!"
What Zit Tooya says: "Give me my wallet!"
What Zit Tooya says: "Stop, thief!"
Officer Johnson says: "You know that guy?"
What Zit Tooya says: "Hardly."
What Zit Tooya says: "He stole my wallet."
Officer Johnson says: "What?!"
Officer Johnson says: "!"
Officer Johnson says: "That makes him a dual offender!"
Officer Johnson says: "Let's get him!"
Squidward says: "Finally, the moment of truth!"
Squidward says: "Say goodbye to anonymity, Mr."
Officer Johnson says: "Freeze thief!"
Squidward says: "No, you don't understand."
What Zit Tooya says: "We know exactly why you want it, wallet snatcher!"
Squidward says: "This isn't as it seems!"
Officer Johnson says: "That's what you'll be saying in the slammer, punk!"
What Zit Tooya says: "It's my ridiculous name!"
What Zit Tooya says: ""What Zit Tooya!"
Squidward says: "But-but-but, I-I-I didn't intentionally do anything wrong."
Officer Johnson says: "Tell it to the judge, lawbreaker."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob?"
Mr. Krabs says: "The boy and I just thought we'd stop by and check on our convict friend."
Squidward says: "Call me what you may, fact of the matter is I found out the mystery customer's name first."
Squidward says: "So I win."
Squidward says: "I win, I win, I win, I win, I win, I win!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Enjoy your prize."
Squidward says: "Whoo-hoo-hoo!"
Squidward says: "Tropical vacation, here I come!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Vacation?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Who said anything about a vacation?"
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "In the brochure, it specifically gives away an ocean liner vacation."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, you mean that brochure."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, that was the prize."
Mr. Krabs says: "The brochure."
Mr. Krabs says: "It was taking up too much room in me drawers, you know."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's your prize."
Squidward says: "You mean, no vacation?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Nope, just the brochure."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, got to get back to counting me loot."
Mr. Krabs says: "Enjoy your new prize, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "See you on the outside in ten years, buddy."
Squidward says: "Oh, well."
Squidward says: "At least I'll have some peace and quiet for the next ten years."
