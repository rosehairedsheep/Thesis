SpongeBob says: "All the greatest pranksters shop here."
SpongeBob says: "This is where I got my gag..."
SpongeBob says: "seanut brittle can."
Patrick says: "Oh, boy, Seanut Brittle."
Patrick says: "Gimmie!"
Patrick tries to open the can.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, wait, it's a booby trap, remember?"
Patrick says: "Nice try, SquarePants, but it's not gonna work this time."
Patrick says: "I'm gonna have some of your delicious Seanut Brittle!"
Patrick says: "Where's the Seanut Brittle?"
SpongeBob says: "That gets funnier every time you say it, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Come on, let's go inside."
SpongeBob walks off screen.
Patrick says: "Seanut Brittle?"
SpongeBob enters the Palace of Pranks and smells the air.
SpongeBob says: "Ah!"
SpongeBob says: "Isn't it everything I said it would be, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Oh, darn it, not again!"
The scene only shows SpongeBob in his aisle. SpongeBob laughs. An old fish named Frank enters the scene.
Frank says: "Good to see you, SpongeBob."
Frank says: "How's my number one customer doing?"
SpongeBob says: "Great, Frank."
SpongeBob says: "This is my friend Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "He wants to become a prankster, too."
Frank says: "That's your first lesson, son, the granddaddy of all pranks."
Frank says: "The joy buzzer."
Patrick says: "I don't get it."
Frank says: "You don't have to get it."
Frank says: "The prank is for the enjoyment of the prankster."
SpongeBob says: "You see, Patrick, Frank here is the master."
SpongeBob says: "I learned all I know about pranks from him."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Frank, let's see what you've got."
Frank says: "Well, this came in just this morning."
Frank says: "Ha!"
Frank says: "Exploding chewing gum."
Frank says: "Only $9."
Frank says: "95."
Patrick says: "I don't get it."
SpongeBob says: "What can we get for one dollar?"
Frank says: "One dollar will get you this fake gag dollar--  fool your friends into thinking you've got a real dollar."
SpongeBob says: "What else have you got?"
Frank holds up a whoopee cushion.
Frank says: "A whoopee cushion."
SpongeBob says: "Nah."
Frank holds up fake vomit.
Frank says: "Fake vomit."
SpongeBob says: "No."
Part of the counter is covered in real vomit.
Frank says: "Real vomit?"
SpongeBob says: "Eww!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't you have anything good?"
Frank says: "Well, there is one prank that I've been saving for a real top of the line prankster."
Frank says: "Invisible Spray!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow, invisible spray!"
Patrick says: "But I can see it."
SpongeBob says: "Gee, Patrick, just think of the pranks we could pull with this."
SpongeBob gives Frank some money.
Frank says: "Good choice."
Frank says: "Now be careful with that stuff, boys."
Frank says: "It stains clothes."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Frank."
SpongeBob says: "Here it is, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "The ultimate prank-- invisible spray."
Patrick says: "What are we gonna do with it?"
SpongeBob says: "I know!"
SpongeBob says: "We'll go spray the park bench and then sit on it, and when people walk by, we'll be floating in midair."
They both think about sitting on an invisible bench, surrounded by Nat, Tom, Tina-Fran, Horace, Halber, and Shelia.
Nat says: "They're floating in midair!"
Tina-Fran says: "How do they do that?"
The thought bubble disappears.
Patrick says: "That's the ultimate prank!"
Patrick says: "Good idea, SpongeBob!"
Patrick gives SpongeBob a thumbs up.
SpongeBob says: "Well, let's get started."
Patrick takes off his shorts.
Patrick says: "Okay, I'm ready."
Patrick drops his pants on the ground.
SpongeBob says: "Any particular reason you took your pants off?"
Patrick says: "Well, that stuff stains clothes, right?"
SpongeBob says: "That it does, Patrick, that it does."
SpongeBob says: "Good thinking."
SpongeBob says: "Here, hold this a second."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Patrick, give me the can."
Patrick says: "I think since spraying the park bench was my idea, I should get to spray it."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, spraying the park bench was my idea."
Patrick says: "Yeah, but I said it was a good idea!"
SpongeBob says: "Give me that thing."
SpongeBob grabs the can and he and Patrick wrestle over it. SpongeBob accidentally sprays their clothes and they disappear.
Patrick says: "Hey, the invisible spray works!"

Tom says: "And on your right, if you look, you'll see two naked guys fighting over a can of paint!"
The passengers laugh and Tom laugh. The bus drives off. SpongeBob covers his lower half.
SpongeBob says: "Oh my gosh, Patrick, help me find our clothes!"
SpongeBob pats the ground, trying to grab the clothes. Patrick sprays SpongeBob's right hand and it disappears.
Patrick says: "I gotta hand it to you, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "You look kinda funny."
Patrick laughs and SpongeBob screams.
SpongeBob says: "Righty, where are you?"
SpongeBob says: "Kind of gives you an empty feeling, huh?"
Patrick takes the can.
Patrick says: "Yeah."
Patrick says: "I see what you mean."
SpongeBob takes the spray can and sprays Patrick's lower half.
SpongeBob says: "No guts, no glory!"
Narrator says: "Several bad puns later..."
The scene returns to SpongeBob and Patrick, who are now invisible. Patrick shakes the can.
Patrick says: "Oh, hey, I think this thing is empty."
SpongeBob grabs the can and shakes it.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, no, it can't be!"
SpongeBob says: "How are we going to pull off the ultimate prank?"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks a lot, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "You used the last of it."
SpongeBob throws the can far away.
Patrick says: "Hey, I think I found our pants."
Patrick says: "Oops!"
Patrick says: "Here, these are yours."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, forget the pants, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Let's get home and wash this paint off."
SpongeBob and Patrick walk off somewhere.
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob, do you know what time it is?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh sure, it's..."
SpongeBob says: "half past invisible."
Patrick says: "Gee, it's getting late."
They walk up behind Nat.
SpongeBob says: "Let's ask this guy."
SpongeBob says: "Excuse me, sir, but do you have the time?"
Nat says: "Sure."
Nat says: "It's, uh, ten to three."
SpongeBob says: "Thank you."
Nat says: "Don't mention it."
Nat turns around to notice there is seemingly no one there.
Patrick says: "Don't mention what?"
Nat says: "Uh, who said that?"
Patrick says: "Me."
Nat says: "Ghosts!"
Nat runs away from them; his eyes pop out. His eyes scream, jump into a car and drive away.
Patrick says: "Hey, I'm no ghost!"
Patrick says: "Of the nerve of that guy and his driving eyeballs."
SpongeBob says: "Wait a second, Patrick, my brain just hatched an idea."
Patrick says: "Lay it on me."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, we're invisible, right?"
Patrick says: "Yeah."
SpongeBob says: "If that guy thought we were ghosts, we could haunt everybody in Bikini Bottom."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, it's the ultimate prank."
SpongeBob says: "Whoo!"
Patrick says: "Whoo!"
SpongeBob says: "High five!"
Patrick says: "High five!"
They give each other a high five.
SpongeBob says: "Let's go scare us some suckers!"

Sandy says: "And didn't I toss that old lamp out yesterday?"
Sandy says: "And since when did I acquire all these portraits of Patrick?"

She enters the escape pod and presses a button. The escape pod flies out of her dome, above the water, past the Bikini Bottom island, and lands in Texas. The escape pod explodes in Texas. SpongeBob and Patrick leave Sandy's house, laughing.

Mr. Krabs says: "Wha?"
SpongeBob and Patrick toss over a table and barrel. They pick up a barrel and a table to make it look like they are floating.

Mr. Krabs uses the specter detector paddle ball by bouncing the stringed ball back and forth from the paddle board.
Mr. Krabs says: "Stay back, I'm well-armed!"

Mr. Krabs says: "You'll never get me!"

Patrick says: "Nice try, Krabs, but we replaced all the glass with rubber!"
Mr. Krabs dives into the toilet, but gets stuck. He pulls himself out and sits on the floor, dazed.
SpongeBob says: "Too late, Krabs, we've already clogged all the toilets."
Mr. Krabs says: "Please, spirits, leave me be."

Mr. Krabs says: "Don't burn me dollar!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, well, well, if it isn't SpongeBob and Patrick."

Patrick says: "Uh, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, we're visible again."
Mr. Krabs says: "So you two are the Bikini Bottom ghosts."
SpongeBob says: "We're really sorry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Please don't chop us into little pieces and eat 'em."
Mr. Krabs puts them down.
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, come on, boys, I'm hip!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I pulled my share of pranks when I was your age."
Mr. Krabs says: "Had me some laughs."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's what we did tonight, right?"
Mr. Krabs says: "We had a good laugh."
