Sandy says: "I say she's in swift need of a reboot!"
Sandy says: "Heee ya!"
Karen's screen shows a picture of a computer wife with words "Computer WIFE progress bar Loading..." beside it, and soon starts up.
SpongeBob says: "Poor guy, the ice is really getting to him."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, no!"
Sandy says: "A simulacrum!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy please!"
SpongeBob says: "Language!"
Sandy says: "Naw, silly!"
Sandy says: "I'm saying, Plankton set up a robotic dummy in his sled!"
Karen says: "That's right."
Karen says: "My selfish husband remains in warm, sunny Bikini Bottom, while I freeze my solder off in this bitter tundra."
Karen says: "In fact,  With the entire town distracted, he's free to pursue the Krabby Patty formula undetected."
SpongeBob says: "Pursue?"
SpongeBob says: "Formula?"
SpongeBob says: "We've gotta find Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs right now!"
Sandy says: "And exactly how do you propose we find him?"
Karen says: "I saw Mr."

Sandy says: "Gasp!"
Sandy says: "Oh, my gosh!"
Sandy says: "Patrick!"
Sandy says: "Lean to the other side!"
Sandy says: "Excuse me, ma'am."
Karen says: "What?"
Sandy pulls off Karen's monitor, stands on SpongeBob, and uses the base's pole and sticks it into the block of ice Squidward is in, and pulls him in.
Sandy says: "Gotcha!"
Plankton says: "Rats."
Sandy says: "Alright, fellas, I know it's cold."
Sandy says: "But let's just push forward and keep a lookout for a frozen crab!"
Patrick says: "I can't feel my looking holes!"
SpongeBob says: "The only thing I can feel is my empty stomach."
Sandy says: "You said it, SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "I already gnawed through all my provisions."
Sandy says: "Hey, Patrick, you got any more of them Gooey Worms on you?"
Patrick says: "I wish I did."
Patrick says: "I lost my last one to the monster and now I'm so hungry!"
SpongeBob says: "Gasp!"
SpongeBob says: "Gary!"
Patrick says: "Great."
Patrick says: "Now we're stuck."
SpongeBob says: "No, we're not!"
SpongeBob says: "Look!"
SpongeBob says: "One of Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs' sailor tattoos!"
SpongeBob says: "It must've frozen off his brittle body."
Sandy says: "We must be heading in the right direction!"
The plane hits the safe, but the safe is okay.
Plankton says: "Perhaps I misjudged the skill on that one."
Plankton says: "Uh-oh."
Plankton says: "Surely, the safe couldn't survive nuclear detonation."
Plankton says: "Come to papa!"
Patrick says: "Hey, I'm trying to sleep."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Sandy says: "He ain't looking so good."
Sandy says: "We better get him to the sleigh, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "SpongeBob?"
Squidward says: "Aaah."
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "You're burning the sleigh!"
Squidward says: "?"
Squidward says: "Are you aware that that was our only mode of transportation?"
Sandy says: "And are you aware I just saved your life?"
Mr. Krabs says: "The race!"
Mr. Krabs says: "The million clams!"
Karen says: "Oh, cool down, there are no winnings, you've been duped!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Duped?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You don't mean by..."
Karen says: "Now you're putting it together!"
Mr. Krabs says: "My formula!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We've got to get back to Bikini Bottom!"
Squidward says: "We might actually have a chance of getting back if we had a sleigh."
Mr. Krabs says: "We're doomed."
SpongeBob says: "No, we're not, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Your chariot awaits!"
Mr. Krabs says: "No offense, but we're not going to catch Plankton moving at a snail's pace."
Sandy says: "Just leave that to the scientist of the group!"
Patrick says: "Oh, geez."
Patrick says: "Why do I have to do everything?"
Patrick says: "Hahahaha!"
Sandy says: "She's all fired up!"
SpongeBob says: "Gary, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, any hazards on the horizon?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Lookin' clear so far."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, keep those circuits warm."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, hang on!"
French Narrator says: "One frozen wasteland later..."
SpongeBob says: "Hooray!"
SpongeBob says: "We made it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay..."
Mr. Krabs says: "then where's my restaurant?"
SpongeBob says: "Perhaps over there.."
Mr. Krabs says: "And where's my formula?"
Sandy says: "Perhaps over there."
Mr. Krabs says: "The Chum Bucket, now serving..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabby Patties?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "We're too late!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We'll see about that, boy-o!"
Harold says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't cut in line."
Harold says: "We've been waiting for a Krabby Patty for three stinking days!"
Mr. Krabs says: "This will only take a minute."
Plankton says: "Keep your pants on out there!"
Plankton says: "I'll get your Krabby Patty just as soon as I get this bottle open."
Mr. Krabs says: "Not if I have anything to say and or do about it!"
Plankton says: "Krabs!"
Plankton says: "Why aren't you frozen under the barren tundra?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I guess I didn't want to miss the big unveiling of MY SANDWHICH!!"
Plankton says: "Well, it would have happened if I could've dislodge this stupid cork!"
Patrick says: "Oh, that's easy!"
All of them says: "PATRICK!!"
Plankton says: "Hahaha!"
Plankton says: "I got it now, Krabsy."
Sandy says: "That may be true, Plankton, but you've got seven angry customers flanking you on all sides."
Plankton says: "Uh..."
Plankton says: "well, I'm sure my loving wife is not a party to this angry mob."
Plankton says: "You-you've gotta help me here, Karen!"
Karen says: "You've gotta help me..."
Karen says: "My monitor nearly froze up for good on your little race to oblivion!"
Plankton says: "Babe, don't blow an amp over this, c'mon!"
Plankton says: "Yowza!"
Plankton says: "Ow!"
Plankton says: "That hurt on so many levels..."
Plankton says: "Okay, I give up."
Plankton says: "You win again, Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Then hand over my formula."
Plankton says: "Okay, Eugene."
Plankton says: "I'll just sign the surrender treaty first."
Mr. Krabs says: "You get back here, Plankton!"
Squidward says: "Here we go again..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Give up now and I'll let you keep one of your antenna!"
Plankton says: "I'd be delighted to see you try!"
Plankton says: "Ooooooh!"
Plankton says: "You're so close."
Plankton says: "So long, suckers!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
Plankton says: "Hehehe!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We're trapped!"
Plankton says: "That's right, Krabs, and if you're thinking of busting out, mind the giant vat of fry grease beneath you."
Mr. Krabs says: "He's going to turn us into fried snacks!"
Patrick says: "Got any dipping sauce?"
Plankton says: "A little taste of your own medicine, aye, crab cakes?"
Abominable Snow Mollusk says: "Nom nom!"
SpongeBob says: "Nom nom?"
Abominable Snow Mollusk says: "Nom nom!"
Abominable Snow Mollusk says: "Nom nom!"
SpongeBob says: "W-wait, big, scary monster."
SpongeBob says: "Don't eat Patrick."

Mr. Krabs says: "Don't eat me, eat Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Wait, what?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "She loves your jellybeans, Patrick!"
Plankton says: "I better go while the going's good."
Abominable Snow Mollusk says: "Jellybean!"
Plankton says: "I can practically taste those Krabby Patties now!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, what happens to Plankton?"
Mr. Krabs says: "He'll just have to wait for nature to take its course."
