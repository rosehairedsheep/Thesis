Mr. Krabs says: "I wonder if it's the new placemats?"
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "Placemats?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "Have you lost your mind?"
Squidward says: "It's that old Patty you keep trying to sell to everybody!"
Squidward says: "It's gone bad."
Mr. Krabs says: "Gone bad?"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's nonsense!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Bring it here, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, why is it in a cage?"
SpongeBob says: "Because it growled at me."
Mr. Krabs says: "You two would have never have lasted in the navy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Let's see how bad you are."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Mr."

Mr. Krabs says: "Make sure you wrap up that Patty."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm not finished with it yet!"
Purple Doctorfish says: "Well, Mr."
Purple Doctorfish says: "Krabs, you gave us quite the scare."
Mr. Krabs says: "So I'm gonna be okay, doc?"
Purple Doctorfish says: "Well, if you don't want to take my word for it, let's just check your chart."
Mr. Krabs says: "Everything okay, doc?"
Purple Doctorfish says: "Don't touch me!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's not a good sign."

Mr. Krabs says: "Davy Jones' locker?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why do I have to go there?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm not a bad crab!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Ah, but you were cheap, and being cheap is a terrible thing."
Flying Dutchman says: "Next stop, Davy Jones' locker!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Here we are."
Mr. Krabs says: "Blech!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why does it smell so foul?"
Flying Dutchman says: "Davy Jones works out a lot."
Flying Dutchman says: "These are his socks."
Flying Dutchman says: "Get in!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, please, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Dutchman, I don't wanna go in there!"

Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's the old policy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now run back and bring out a fresh one."
SpongeBob says: "Aye, aye, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "Sorry about the confusion."

Mr. Krabs says: "It sure does feel good to be generous."
Squidward says: "Here's your mail, Eugene."
Mr. Krabs says: "Thanks, Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "You look rested."
Squidward says: "Yeah, these naps at work are doing wonders for me."

Squidward says: "Me, too."
Squidward says: "How are we gonna get paid?"
Squidward says: "Gee, Mr."

Mr. Krabs says: "I'll wake up soon."
Squidward says: "Uh..."
Squidward says: ""dream"?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Sure."

Nathiel Waters says: "Hey, it's my lucky day, a penny!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Your luck just ran out!"
Nathiel Waters says: "Hey, man, ease back."
Nathiel Waters says: "You're crushing my arm."
Mr. Krabs says: "Unhand that penny, or the arm comes off."
Flying Dutchman says: "A-ha!"
Flying Dutchman says: "That little display of parsimonious penny pinching just earned you a nice little spot in Davy Jones' locker..."
Flying Dutchman says: "For eternity!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm not cheap, I'm generous!"
Squidward says: "You almost tore a man's arm off for a penny."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, a deal's a deal."
Mr. Krabs says: "Let's go."
SpongeBob says: "Wait just a burger-flipping second!"
Flying Dutchman turns around.
Flying Dutchman says: "Who dares back-sass the Flying Dutchman?"
SpongeBob says: "That would be me: SpongeBob Back-SassPants."
SpongeBob says: "I say you got the wrong crab."
SpongeBob says: "This Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs is the most generous, big-hearted, non-skinflinted crab in the whole sea."
Flying Dutchman says: "He'd sell your soul for a couple of bucks."
SpongeBob says: "I'd bet my soul he wouldn't."
Flying Dutchman says: "You got yourself a bet."
Flying Dutchman says: "Okay, Krabs, I'll let you stay, but first, help me settle a bet."
Flying Dutchman says: "If you had to choose between SpongeBob and all the money I have in my pocket, which would you take?"
Mr. Krabs says: "That depends."
Mr. Krabs says: "How much money we talking about?"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"

Mr. Krabs says: "Look, Squidward, money!"
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, I can't believe I'm saying this, but how could you trade SpongeBob for sixty-two cents?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You think I could've gotten more?"
Squidward says: "He stuck up for you and you sold him out."
Squidward says: "You should be ashamed of yourself!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Here, take him back."
Mr. Krabs says: "You heard what I said about the money?"
Flying Dutchman says: "Heard what you said?"
Flying Dutchman says: "I couldn't hear myself thinking with this one around."
Flying Dutchman says: "I only had him for thirty seconds."
Flying Dutchman says: "And it's jellyfishing this and Mermaid Man that."
Flying Dutchman says: "Why, not giving him back is a fate worse than death!"
SpongeBob says: "everything."
SpongeBob says: "I love jellyfishing, do you like jellyfishing?"
SpongeBob says: "I do."
SpongeBob says: "You want to go jellyfishing with me some time?"
SpongeBob says: "Bring your own net!"
Flying Dutchman says: "He's your problem now."
Mr. Krabs says: "Heh, about trading you for pocket change..."
SpongeBob says: "Say no more, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "You did it for the Krusty Krab."
SpongeBob says: "I would have done the same thing."
Mr. Krabs says: "You would have?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
Flying Dutchman says: "Dutchman's residence."
SpongeBob says: "I work at the Krusty Krab."
SpongeBob says: "My best friend is Patrick."
