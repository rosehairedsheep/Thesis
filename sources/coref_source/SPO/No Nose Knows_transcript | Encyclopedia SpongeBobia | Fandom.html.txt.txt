Episode starts with Squidward walking home. He places his keys on the table, and puts down a bag that says "Nautical Mart" on it. He then takes some stuff out.
Squidward says: "I thought I told that kid not to put the organic sea cucumber on top of the free range anemones!"
Squidward says: "Well, at least my flowers survived the trip."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, would you please find your own flowers to sniff?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "What about Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Does he have to find his own flowers, too?"
Squidward says: "What are you talking about, nitwit?"
Squidward says: "He doesn't even have a nose!"
Patrick says: "Of course I have a nose, Squidward."
Patrick says: "Why, it's as plain as the nose on my..."
Squidward says: "My floors!"
Squidward says: "Think fast, Squiddy."
Squidward says: "I've got your nose."
Patrick says: "You do?"
Squidward says: "Yeah."
Squidward says: "I've got it..."
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "right here."
Patrick says: "Give me!"
Patrick says: "Give it here!"
Squidward says: "If you want it, you gotta go get it."
Patrick says: "There!"
Patrick says: "Well, SpongeBob, what do you think of my new nose?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, that's not a nose, that's a..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "hermit crab."
Patrick says: "I guess I'll always be a noseless freak."
SpongeBob says: "It's not so abnormal to be noseless."
SpongeBob says: "Just look around."
SpongeBob says: "Lots of fish don't have noses."
Patrick says: "Yeah, but all my friends have noses."
Patrick says: "You, Squidward, Sandy, even Mr."
Patrick says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "There you are!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, Patrick, if you're so concerned about not having a nose, why don't you just get a new one stitched on to your face?"
Patrick says: "I can do that?"
Surgeon says: "Well, what do you think?"
Patrick says: "Sorry, doc."
Patrick says: "I don't really think it's me."
Surgeon says: "That's a-okay."
Surgeon says: "That's cool."
Surgeon says: "As lead surgeon here, I take a hypothetical oath."
Surgeon says: "Which means I will not stop, I will not rest, I will not cut a single toenail, until the customer is 100% satisfied!"
Surgeon says: "So please, browse our extensive wall of noses!"
Surgeon says: "And I will patiently await your final decision."
Patrick says: "Okay!"
Patrick says: "Let's see."
Patrick says: "Hmm."
Surgeon says: "Excellent choice!"
SpongeBob says: "All right, Patrick, let's unveil the new schnoze!"
Patrick says: "Wait, stop, careful, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "This fragile stitching requires tender care."
Patrick says: "Allow me to carefully remove the bandages."
SpongeBob says: "There it is, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Your brand new sniffer!"
SpongeBob says: "Looking good, buddy!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I've gotta go to work now."
SpongeBob says: "Have fun with your new nose."
Patrick says: "I will!"
Patrick says: "Now, how do I use this thing?"
Fred says: "Well, I guess I won't be eating those."
Squidward says: "Let's see Patrick destroy these."
Patrick says: "All these years I knew I was missing out on something, but I never thought smelling could be this good!"
Narrator says: "48 hours later..."
SpongeBob says: "Hiya, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "How..."
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, looking good."
Patrick says: "Oh, the smells!"
Patrick says: "They're everywhere!"
Patrick says: "It's unbearable!"
Squidward says: "What's wrong with the pinhead?"
Patrick says: "Oh, it's another one!"
Patrick says: "No!"
Patrick says: "I can't take it!"
Squidward says: "Where do you think you're going?"
Patrick says: "To do what should have been done long ago."
Patrick says: "Yuck!"
Squidward says: "What are you doing with my cheese?"
Patrick says: "It's rotten garbage now."
Patrick says: "That's better."
Squidward says: "That was my cheese."
Squidward says: "It's supposed to smell like that, kelp for brains!"
Patrick says: "You are sick, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "1, 2, 3, 4..."
Patrick says: "You!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, help!"
Patrick says: "There."
SpongeBob says: "I can't work at the Krusty Krab looking like this."
SpongeBob says: "I'm out of uniform."
Patrick says: "Well, you can't go to work smelling like that."
Patrick says: "You should be thanking me, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "This air freshener should finish the job."
Mr. Krabs says: "What the barnacles do you think you're doing?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're chasing away all me customers!"
Patrick says: "Well, good!"
Patrick says: "No one should have to eat in this stench!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why, I got a good mind to..."
Patrick says: "Say no more, you can thank me later."
Patrick says: "Right now, I've got many more stink holes to swab clean."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, that new honker of his has turned him into a complete jerk!"
Sandy says: "Hiya, Pat."
Patrick says: "Take a bath, fleabag!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I've asked you all here because we all face a similar problem."
Mr. Krabs says: "The problem bein' a sea star with a nose that's gotten way out of hand!"
Squidward says: "You got that right, yeah!"
Sandy says: "Yeah!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now what I want to know is, are we going to do something about it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "?"
Squidward says: "You bet we're gonna do, yeah!"
Sandy says: "Yeah, sure are!"
Squidward says: "Let's give him what for!"
Sandy says: "Let's hogtie him and run him out of town on a rail!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Not now, boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We're in the middle of a public listen!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That no-good, nose-flartin..."
SpongeBob says: "It is not Patrick's fault!"
All says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "It's the new nose that has betrayed us."
SpongeBob says: "My grandma SquarePants always says, punish the nose, not the man."
SpongeBob says: "But we're going to need something foul, something beyond foul, a stench that will blow the socks off his fungus-infested socks!"
SpongeBob says: "With a little raw sewage for good measure."
Mr. Krabs says: "Attaboy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now for the moment of truth!"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, sir!"
Patrick says: "Hello."
SpongeBob says: "Well, this is terrible!"
SpongeBob says: "All Patrick wanted was to be like the rest of us, and we punished him for it."
Squidward says: "Who cares?"
Squidward says: "At least now that pink moron will leave us alone."
Patrick says: "I heard that!"
