SpongeBob and Squidward are walking down the road towards the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob says: "So, I was all ready to drain the fries, but I cooked the fries slightly too long!"
SpongeBob says: "So..."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "So, here's where the bizarre twist comes in."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "They weren't overcooked at all!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, look!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow, what happened to the Krusty Krab?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Good morning!"
Mr. Krabs says: "The Krusty Towers is now open for business!"
SpongeBob says: "Why did you build a hotel, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm glad you asked, son."
Mr. Krabs says: "Remember when I went to that fast food convention and stayed in that fancy hotel?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I had a beautiful room."
Mr. Krabs says: "The employees were so friendly."
Mr. Krabs says: "They catered to me every whim, no matter how demeaning it was."
Mr. Krabs says: "Because they lived by a code."
Mr. Krabs says: "And that code was engraved in fine gold above the grand fireplace: "We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request."
Mr. Krabs says: "" Everything was perfect until I got the bill!"
Mr. Krabs says: "They charged me for everything."
Mr. Krabs says: "$25 for a hamburger!"
Mr. Krabs says: "If they can charge that much for a lousy burger, imagine how much I could charge for a lousy Krabby Patty!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And thus, the Krusty Towers was born."
Squidward says: "Why would anyone stay in a hotel in Bikini Bottom?"
Squidward says: "It's in the middle of scenic nowhere!"
Squidward says: "There's nothing to do but get stung by jellyfish."
Squidward says: "See?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Ooh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Come inside."
Mr. Krabs says: "Isn't it beautiful?"
Squidward says: "Where are all the new hotel employees?"
Mr. Krabs says: "My first hotel guest!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Watch me reel him in."
Mr. Krabs says: "Welcome to the Krusty Towers, where our motto is "We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request."
Dave says: "Oh, that's great."
Dave says: "I'd like a double Krabby Patty with no onions and extra pickles."
Mr. Krabs says: "If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to rent a room and order room service."
Squidward says: "Boy, you reeled that one in like a pro."
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, Squidward, you man the front desk."
Patrick says: "I'd like a Krabby Patty, please."
Squidward says: "This is a hotel now."
Squidward says: "If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to get a room and order room service."
Patrick says: "Okay, one Krabby Patty and one room with cheese."
Patrick says: "Oh, and can I get cheese on the Krabby Patty, too?"
Squidward says: "Patrick, you only live 400 yards away."
Squidward says: "Why do you want to check into a hotel?"
Patrick says: "Sometimes I just need to get away from it all."
Patrick says: "Wow, this hotel has everything!"
Squidward says: "Gimme that!"
Squidward says: "Now sign the register."
Patrick says: "I didn't know there would be a test."
Patrick says: "I didn't study!"
Squidward says: "Patrick, all you have to do is write your name."
Patrick says: "Oh, okay."
Squidward says: "Close enough."
Squidward says: "Here's your room key."
Patrick says: "I'll need some help with my bags."
Squidward says: "How can you have bags?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "You just found out this is a hotel!"
Patrick says: "This is a hotel?"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Take Patrick and his bags to his room."
Patrick says: "What about my Krabby Patty?"
Squidward says: "And bring him a Krabby Patty."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward, you can take Patrick's bags up to his room."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, you go make the Krabby Patty."
Squidward says: "Oh, Mr Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's the matter?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Afraid of a little manual labor?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm Squidward and I have to work for a living."
Mr. Krabs says: "Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo."
Squidward says: "Fine."
Squidward says: "Let's go, Patrick."
Squidward says: "What's in these bags, rocks?"
Squidward says: "Hey, these are rocks!"
Squidward says: "Why is your suitcase full of rocks?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Patrick says: "I don't tell you how to live your life!"
Squidward says: "Well, here's your room."
Patrick says: "Wow."
Squidward says: "Enjoy your stay."
Patrick says: "Squidward, wait!"
Patrick says: "Keep up the good work and there'll be more where that came from."
SpongeBob says: "Your Krabby Patty, sir."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward, cool rock."
Patrick says: "Hold on a second, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "Here you are, my good man."
SpongeBob says: "Why, thank you, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "There's plenty more where that came from, my good friend  Squidward!"
Squidward says: "What now?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Patrick says: "I don't like crusts on my sandwich!"
Squidward says: "It's a bun; it's all crust!"
Squidward says: "How am I suppose to cut the crust off a bun?"
Patrick says: "Peel it."
SpongeBob says: "Room service!"
SpongeBob says: "Here's the fifty Krabby Patties you ordered."
Patrick says: "Could you do one more thing for me?"
Squidward says: "Why don't you ask SpongeBob?"
Patrick says: "Good idea, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "How may I serve you, sir?"
Patrick says: "I need you to eat these Krabby Patties with me."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yes, sir!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hold on."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Patrick needs your help."
Squidward says: "What?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "Why didn't he ask me before I walked all the way downstairs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "He said he didn't want to bother you, but he got over it."
Squidward is unclogging the toilet when he unclogs SpongeBob.
Patrick says: "Hooray!"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, this is ridiculous!"
Squidward says: "Patrick's being completely unreasonable!"
Mr. Krabs says: "He can be as unreasonable as he wants!"
Mr. Krabs says: "The plaque, Squidward, the plaque!"
Squidward says: "But, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Deny no guests!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why, hello, Patrick."
Mr. Krabs says: "You need Squidward to come up right away?"
Mr. Krabs says: "He'll be right there."
Squidward says: "A bubble bath?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "Why would I give you a bubble bath?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Patrick says: "Well, because Mr."
Patrick says: "Krabs said you would!"
Patrick says: "Well, be sure to make my back extra shiny clean."
Squidward says: "That's it!"
Squidward says: "I've had enough!"
Patrick says: "Squidward, wait!"
Patrick says: "The toilet's backed up again!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, you can't take that elevator!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're an employee!"
Squidward says: "Not anymore!"
Squidward says: "I quit!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Quit?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You can't quit!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Welcome to the Krusty Towers..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Squidward says: "One room, please."
Squidward says: "On the top floor."
Mr. Krabs says: "What do you think you're doing?"
Squidward says: "I need a vacation."
Squidward says: "I'm overworked."
Squidward says: "And what better place to relax than Krusty Towers?"
Squidward says: "Where "we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request."
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't have to rent you a room!"
Squidward says: "I've got cash."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "here's your room key."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, carry my things to my room."
SpongeBob says: "Aye aye, guest sir."
Squidward says: "And you can carry me to my room."
Mr. Krabs says: "And why in tarnation would I do that?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You got four legs that aren't broken."
Squidward says: "The plaque."
Squidward says: "Too bad we couldn't take the elevator, but it is for guests only, and you are an employee."
SpongeBob says: "Your room, sir."
Squidward says: "And I'd like to order room service."
Squidward says: "I'd like a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenail clippings, and nose hair."
Mr. Krabs says: "You've got to be kidding me!"
Squidward says: "And I want it here in five seconds."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, sir!"
SpongeBob says: "Here you are, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, you got your stinky sandwich."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now eat it."
Squidward says: "Oh, I'm not going to eat this."
Squidward says: "You are."
Mr. Krabs says: "What?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're out of your mind if you think I'm going to eat that!"
SpongeBob says: "Psst, that's not really a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenails, and nose hair."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "We were all out of cheese."
Patrick says: "Hooray!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What is it, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Send up a dozen cookies just like mother used to make."
Mr. Krabs says: "Here's your homemade cookies."
Squidward says: "These don't taste anything like mom used to make!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, how did your mother make 'em?"
Squidward says: "How should I know?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "Ask my mother!"
SpongeBob says: "No good, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mrs. Tentacles says: "Allow me, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Great!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now that me laundry's in the trunk..."
SpongeBob says: "There's room for you to sit up front!"
Mrs. Tentacles says: "Let's go bake some cookies, boys!"
SpongeBob says: "Hooray!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hooray!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well?"
Squidward says: "I'm impressed!"
Squidward says: "These are just like mother used to make."
Squidward says: "I just wish mom was a better cook."
Mr. Krabs says: "So you're all taken care of?"
Squidward says: "Hm, just one teensy tiny problem."
Squidward says: "This room is hideous."
Squidward says: "Redesign it."
Squidward says: "Neptune the 14th would be nice."
Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
Squidward says: ""We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request."
Squidward says: ""  Perfect!"
Mr. Krabs says: "This room is exactly the same as when we started!"
Squidward says: "Nothing like getting back to the basics."
Mr. Krabs says: "Let's get out of here, SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "Oh, before you leave, I want to go swimming."
Mr. Krabs says: "The pool's out back!"
Squidward says: "Ha ha, are you crazy?"
Squidward says: "I'm not going outside to swim."
Mr. Krabs says: "Anything else stupid and unreasonable that you want?"
Squidward says: "Nope, that's it."
Mr. Krabs says: "You don't need me to chew your food for ya?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Or make you a back scratcher out of me own spine?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Or maybe extinguish the sun so the light don't get in your eyes?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Squidward says: "No, I'm good."
SpongeBob says: "Me, too."
Patrick says: "Wow, an indoor pool?"
Patrick says: "Well, this place is fancy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, that hotel was a bad idea from the start."
Patrick says: "That was a hotel?"
Nurse says: "Your bill, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "$15,000?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Squidward says: "You're not going to have a heart attack, are you?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Not at these prices!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Forget hotels."
Mr. Krabs says: "This hospital rack is where the money is!"
Patrick says: "This is a hospital?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Pack your bags, boys!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're going to medical school!"
SpongeBob says: "Hooray!"
Patrick says: "Hooray!"
Squidward says: "Oh, boy."
