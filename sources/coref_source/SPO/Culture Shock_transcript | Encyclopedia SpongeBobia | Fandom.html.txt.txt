Mr Krabs says: "I'm losing money on this deal!"
Fred says: "It's worth every penny."
Squidward says: "You bottom feeders!"
Squidward says: "You don't even know talent!"
Crowd says: "No talent!"
Crowd says: "No talent!"
Crowd says: "No talent!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward, can I go on now?"
Squidward says: "Yeah, show's over!"

Crowd says: "I like that."
Crowd says: "Alright!"
Crowd says: "We want more!"
Crowd says: "We want more!"
Crowd says: "We want more!"
Crowd says: "We wantâ€”"
Squidward says: "They want an encore!"
Squidward goes backstage and grabs SpongeBob. Then shows the crowd SpongeBob and they cheer. Then he puts his own head through the curtain and the crowd goes silent.
SpongeBob's arm gets a cheer, but Squidward's does not. SpongeBob's leg is shown then curtain rises and SpongeBob is mopping. Curtain closes then opens to reveal Squidward mopping and the crowd goes silent.
Squidward stops and he is angry. He tries to mop somewhere else to impress them. He then raises his hands up in a ta-da moment, but someone in the crowd throws a tomato and SpongeBob sweeps it up as the crowd cheers. Backstage, Harold and Margaret SquarePants bring Mr. Krabs up in a wheelbarrow full of cash.
Mr. Krabs says: "You did it, Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What a great show!"
Mrs. SquarePants says: "Oh, my son's a star!"
Mr. SquarePants says: "Who ever knew he had such talent?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll be needing another wheelbarrow for next week's show!"
