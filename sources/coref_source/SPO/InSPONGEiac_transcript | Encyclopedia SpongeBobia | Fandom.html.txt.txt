SpongeBob says: "â™ªMop, mop, mop, mop, mopping, mopping, mopping, mopping, mopping mopping!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "We need another Krabby Patty."
SpongeBob says: "Sure thing."
Mr. Krabs says: "What's that?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't think so."
Mr. Krabs says: "You used too much mustard!"
SpongeBob says: "But, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I..."
Mr. Krabs says: "You obviously you didn't use your hydraulic mustard gauge."
Mr. Krabs says: "411 years!"
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Your skills are rusty, you're not your usual sharp self!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Did you have breakfast this morning?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, I had a cup of sea kelp and a Neptune muffin."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hmm..."
Mr. Krabs says: "well, what about sleep, young man?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Did you get enough sleep?"
SpongeBob says: "I did go to bed 2 minutes later than usual."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're an insomniac!"
SpongeBob says: "An insomni-wha?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're a person who can't sleep and if you can't get enough sleep, your mind starts to go!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now you go home and get some rest!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, but, sir, I can't miss work at the Krusty Krab."
Mr. Krabs says: "Miss work?"
Mr. Krabs says: "If you keep making mistakes like that, boyo, there will be no Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "No Krusty Krab?"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's right!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, get!"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "Come back first thing tomorrow after a good night's sleep!"
SpongeBob says: "I just don't get it, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "I don't usually have a problem sleeping, do I?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I am not going to allow a mistake like today's to happen again."
SpongeBob says: "I am going straight to bed!"
SpongeBob says: "This pillow is hard as a rock!"
SpongeBob says: "What to do?"
Gary says: "Meow meow meow meow."
SpongeBob says: "You're right, Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "Warm milk puts me right to sleep."
SpongeBob says: "Now, that should do the trick!"
Patrick says: "Uh-huh."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yuck!"
SpongeBob says: "Never mind that, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "I need your help, desperately!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm a insomniac!"
SpongeBob says: "I need to sleep!"
Patrick says: "Say no more, buddy."
Patrick says: "I know just the thing."
Patrick says: "Get comfy."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, boy."
SpongeBob says: "A bedtime story."
Patrick says: "Okay."
Patrick says: "Once upon a time, there was a sleepy little boy."
SpongeBob says: "Ah, yay..."
Patrick says: "The sleepy boy was the sleepiest boy in all the kingdom."
SpongeBob says: "Mmm, sounds like me."
Patrick says: "One night, he nestled into bed for a long slumber."
SpongeBob says: "Slumber..."
Patrick says: "And Sir Cecil, the sea sleep king, sprinkled him with mystical sleepy dust."
SpongeBob says: "Aw, thank you, Sir Cecil."
Patrick says: "He couldn't have been cozier."
Patrick says: "When, without warning,  an excitable sea troll burst through the window!"
Patrick says: ""Wakey-wakey, sleepy-doo!"
Patrick says: "", he bellowed."
Patrick says: "Then suddenly he was whisked away by eagle-winged mollusks into the night sky!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what are you doing?"
SpongeBob says: "What kind of a bedtime story was that, anyway?"
Patrick says: "It's called The Land of Perpetual Excitement."
Patrick says: "You know, it's a "get out of bed" story."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I'm trying to go to sleep."
Patrick says: "Oh."
Patrick says: "Right."
Patrick says: "Oh, I know!"
Patrick says: "I'll sing you a lullaby from my childhood!"
Patrick says: ""Get up, be active, Get up, be active, Get up, be active, Get up, be active!"
Patrick says: "Get up, be active!"
Patrick says: "Get up, be active!"
Patrick says: "Get up, don't lie down!"
Patrick says: "Get up, don't lie down!"
Patrick says: "Get up, don't lie down!"
SpongeBob says: "Um, Patrick, that's..."
Patrick says: "Get up, don't lie down!"
Patrick says: "Get up, don't lie down!"
Patrick says: "Get up, be active!"
Patrick says: "Get up, be active!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, this isn't..."
Patrick says: "Get up, be active!"
Patrick says: "Get up, be active!"
Patrick says: "Get up, don't lie down!"
Patrick says: "Get up, don't lie down!"
SpongeBob says: "That's a catchy bit..."
Patrick says: "Get up, don't lie down!"
Patrick says: "Get up, don't lie down!"
SpongeBob says: "That's an excellent number, but..."
Patrick says: "Get up, don't lie down!"
Patrick says: "Get up, don't lie down!"
Patrick says: "Get up, don't lie down!"
Patrick says: "Get up, don't lie down!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "This isn't helping either!"
Patrick says: "Well, what-what abou- well, I don't know what you want from me."
Patrick says: "It's not like I have a magic wand to wave."
Patrick says: "Or do I?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, barnacles."
Patrick says: "Hocus pocus!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, get serious, please!"
Patrick says: "Abra zeptabra!"
SpongeBob says: "I really appreciate your efforts, but I gotta try something else, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "'Kay?"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, I see you're serious about this now."
Patrick says: "I didn't want to do this, but I'm gonna let you in on a little family secret."
Patrick says: "Old grandma suffered from severe toe barnacles."
SpongeBob says: "Blech!"
Patrick says: "And she invented the secret elixir for just such an emergency."
Patrick says: "Drink up."
SpongeBob says: "Okay..."
Patrick says: "Drink it!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, that wasn't too bad."
SpongeBob says: "What was it?"
Patrick says: "Coffee."
SpongeBob says: "C-C-C-C-C-Coffee?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, for the last time, Patrick, I'm trying to go to sleep!"
Patrick says: "Oops."
SpongeBob says: "Uh-oh.."
SpongeBob says: "feeling jittery, heart p-p-pounding, teeth grinding..."
SpongeBob says: "N-no!"
SpongeBob says: "No, stop!"
SpongeBob says: "We gotta get to sleep."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I guess I'll just have to let my legs tire out and catch up with my weary brain."
As he continues to run, the sea troll from Patrick's story shows up.
Sea troll says: "Wakey-wakey, sleepy-doo!"
SpongeBob says: "Ahh!"
SpongeBob says: "Sea troll!"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Just a shrub."
SpongeBob says: "Keep going till you crash, SpongeBob."
Warm milk says: "SpongeBob, why did you drink me?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Warm Milk, you just tasted so good."
SpongeBob says: "Shoo!"
SpongeBob says: "That billboard is definitely not talking to you."
SpongeBob walks away but the milk on the billboard comes to life unnoticed by him.
Warm Milk says: "Why, SpongeBob, why?"
Mustard Krabs says: "Stop wasting all me mustard, boy-o!"
SpongeBob notices a giant Mr. Krabs with mustard spouts for eye stalks, exclaims  and runs for it as the mustard spouts continue to squirt.
Mustard Krabs says: "Me profits!"
Mustard Krabs says: "Me profits!"
The mustard gets in SpongeBob's way and he backs up and knocks over mustard barrels he tries to run but the barrels of mustard toppled and splatter all over the screen, now Spongebob is in some sort of dimension, sitting on top the barrels as the squidward heads came out from the barrels.
Squidwards says: "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
Squidwards says: "Mr."
Squidwards says: "Krabs is going to be upset!"
Squidwards says: "Ha, ha, ha, ha!"
Patrick says: "Sponge cake!"
SpongeBob gets eaten by Patrick and breaks a bed when he lands.
SpongeBob says: "What's this?"
SpongeBob says: "Another vision?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, why, why?"
SpongeBob says: "Please, please, please let me sleep for just 5 minutes!"
Sir Cecil says: "Do not despair, my child."
SpongeBob says: "Sir Cecil, the sea sleep king?"
Sir Cecil says: "Just close your eyes and slumber."
Sir Cecil says: "With some magic dust!"
SpongeBob says: "Hmm..."
SpongeBob says: "it's getting all sleepish around here."
Mr. Krabs says: "Boy-o..."
Mr. Krabs says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Hmm?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Y-Yes..."
SpongeBob says: "SpongeBob reporting for sleeping, tired."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ew!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're stinking like a swabby short pants after a clam dig!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You sure you didn't forget something, boy?"
SpongeBob says: "Forget.."
SpongeBob says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, right, right, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "How could I be so forgetful?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Heh, that's my boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "What the barnacles?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob washes his hands with the mustard dispenser.
SpongeBob says: "Employees must wash their hands before cooking."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, that's nice..."
Mr. Krabs says: "That ain't the sink, kiddo!"
SpongeBob says: "I know, I know, I just need a quiet place..."
SpongeBob says: "to nap."
Mr. Krabs says: "Me mustard!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You didn't heed my words, did ya?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You couldn't be bothered to get some shut eye, could ya?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "I tried, I really tried!"
SpongeBob says: "But my insomnia got the best of me!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now he's crying away me mustard."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's enough boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Me profits!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Your crying the perfect amount!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hold it, boy-o, you're a natural born mustard dispenser!"
SpongeBob says: "Is that a good thing?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Dow, uh, nuh, Oh no, no boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's- It's terrible."
SpongeBob cries again. Squidward overhears this.
Mr. Krabs says: "Just terrible!"
Squidward says: "Best day at work ever!"
