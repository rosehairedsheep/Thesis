SpongeBob is asleep. When his ringing shell phone wakes him up, he gives a startled yelp and then answers.
SpongeBob says: "Hello?"
Sandy says: "Hey, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "How's it going?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hiya, Sandy!"
Sandy says: "Hey, listen, I was wondering if you could come by tonight."
SpongeBob says: "Sure!"
SpongeBob says: "What's up?"
Sandy says: "I whipped up an invention I'm gonna unveil tonight in front of my comrades, and I need you to be my test subject!"
SpongeBob says: "I will be there!"
Sandy says: "You're not gonna forget, are ya?"
SpongeBob says: "Of course not!"
SpongeBob says: "Have I ever let you down before?"
SpongeBob says: "Hello?"
Sandy says: "Just be here!"
SpongeBob says: "With Gary as my witness, I won't let you down, Miss Cheeks!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, how the barnacles do you put this thing together?"
SpongeBob says: "I won't let Sandy down!"
SpongeBob says: "I won't let Sandy down!"
SpongeBob says: "Good morning, cap'n!"
SpongeBob says: "I won't let Sandy down!"
SpongeBob says: "I won't let Sandy down, down!"
SpongeBob says: "I won't let Sandy down!"
SpongeBob says: "Right after work I'm going over to Sandy's, who I'm not gonna let down."
Mr. Krabs says: "Boy?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, sir?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I've got a special assignment for ya."
Mr. Krabs says: "This is a build-it-yourself telescope."
Mr. Krabs says: "The only problem is, I can't figure out how to put the darn thing together."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's where you come in."
SpongeBob says: ""Telescope Assembly Manual"..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now read this cover-to-cover, and be prepared to put this together at me house tonight."
SpongeBob says: "Tonight?"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's not gonna be a problem, is it?"
SpongeBob says: "Umm..."
SpongeBob says: "Well, actually..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Excellent!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Because I was looking at your annual employee report card..."
Mr. Krabs says: "See ya tonight!"
SpongeBob says: "What am I gonna do?"
SpongeBob says: "You can do it."
SpongeBob says: "You made the commitments, you have to honor them."
SpongeBob says: "Both of them."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hiya, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "What're you doing back here?"
Patrick says: "Well, Sorry to disturb you during work hours."
Patrick says: "I just wanted to remind you about my birthday."
SpongeBob says: "No need to remind me!"
SpongeBob says: "I wouldn't forget about my best buddy's birthday!"
Patrick says: "Then why aren't you saying the words?"
SpongeBob says: "What words?"
Patrick says: ""Happy birthday"!"
Patrick says: "It's today!"
Patrick says: "My birthday's today!"
Patrick says: "Well, you surely must remember what you're gonna bring to my birthday, right?"
SpongeBob says: "Uhh..."
Patrick says: "My birthday cake!"
Patrick says: "You're supposed to bring my birthday cake!"
SpongeBob says: "Tonight?"
Patrick says: "Yes, tonight!"
Patrick says: "Well, when else am I gonna celebrate it?"
Patrick says: "At least I had the courtesy to start the party after my best friend got off of work."
Patrick says: "See ya tonight, buddy!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Neptune!"
SpongeBob says: "This is worse than I ever could've imagined!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "What'cha doing?"
Sandy says: "Hey, SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "Just putting the finishing touches on my invention."
Sandy says: "Thanks for assisting me!"
Sandy says: "You're such a big help!"
Sandy says: "No wonder Mr."
Sandy says: "Krabs relies on you so heavily."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I knew I wouldn't have to fire ya!"
SpongeBob says: "You can rely on me, sir!"
SpongeBob says: "I wouldn't wanna jeopardize my employee record."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, let's see what we got here."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, it says on page 472, section C-17, that you need a right-angled motorized hex drill to assemble this thing."
Mr. Krabs says: "Really..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Why don't you go into town and pick up one of those hex drill thingies."
SpongeBob says: "I..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Or you could sit there and watch me fill out your employee report card..."
Mr. Krabs clicks his pen, and SpongeBob runs out into downtown Bikini Bottom, he slams into the door of Tom's Toolery, there is a note on the door.
Sandy says: "Just finishin' up here!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "Heh, oh, hey, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "What're you doing in town?"
Patrick says: "I was just buying some birthday hats for my birthday party."
Patrick says: "You didn't forget my party, did you?"
SpongeBob says: "Forget?"
SpongeBob says: "How can I forget my best friend's birthday party?"
Patrick says: "You're already forgetting one thing!"
SpongeBob says: "Ha, ha!"
SpongeBob says: "No, I haven't!"
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "Have I?"
Patrick says: "Hello!"
Patrick says: "?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "My birthday cake!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah, that!"
SpongeBob says: "I w..."
SpongeBob says: "I was just getting to that!"
SpongeBob says: "That's why I was here in town!"

SpongeBob says: "Now, you just go home, and I'm gonna go get your cake, you silly guy, you!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi!"
SpongeBob says: "I need a birthday cake!"
Cashier says: "This is what I got..."
SpongeBob says: ""Sorry About the Scabies"."
SpongeBob says: "Um, can you change it to say "Happy Birthday"?"

Sandy says: "And the birthday cake?"
Sandy says: "Greetings, my distinguished colleagues!"
Sandy says: "Tonight, you will witness an invention so revolutionary, it may change modern science forever!"
Sandy says: "Now to demonstrate, my assistant will disrobe and enter the machine."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Sandy says: "Some of you may be wondering why the test subject is disrobing."
Sandy says: "It is because..."
SpongeBob says: "It must be that spicy kelp I ate earlier."
SpongeBob says: "I gotta go use the lavatory."
SpongeBob says: "I'll be right back!"
Patrick says: "You finally made it!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, a, uhh..."
SpongeBob says: "Big..."

Patrick says: "Serve up the cake so I can tear into that present!"
SpongeBob says: "The cake!"
SpongeBob says: "I must've left it at Sandy's!"
Patrick says: "You took it to Sandy's?"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "I said "The bakery delivers, isn't that handy?"
SpongeBob says: ""."
SpongeBob says: "In fact, I think I hear them outside!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait there while I go check."

SpongeBob says: "I'll be right back."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, let's get started, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "What happened to your clothes, boy?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Boy?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hold on, boy, you're supposed to be using that motorized hex drill!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, where is it?"
SpongeBob says: "Ugh!"
SpongeBob says: "I left it at Patrick's rock!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Patrick's rock?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's it doin' there?"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, why are your clothes invisible?"
SpongeBob says: "Never mind that, could I please borrow your present?"
Patrick says: "No, no, you can't borrow my birthday present!"
SpongeBob says: "Not even for a minute?"
Patrick says: "No, not till they deliver my birthday cake."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, I'll be right back!"
Patrick says: "Hold on, where're you going?"
Sandy says: "Hold it!"
Sandy says: "Where's my little assistant going this time?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Your little assistant?"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's my assistant you're talking to!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's going on here!"
Mr. Krabs says: "?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Patrick says: "Yeah, I'd like to know also!"
Patrick says: "What kind of a birthday present is this?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, SpongeBob was supposed to bring that to me!"
Sandy says: "That looks like my power drill!"
SpongeBob says: "I know you all had important things tonight."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, your telescope, Patrick, your birthday, and, Sandy, you have this big presentation."
SpongeBob says: "I just couldn't say "no" to any of you."
Sandy says: "Aw, you overextended yourself."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, you should've said something."
Patrick says: "We could've worked something out."
SpongeBob says: "Aw."
SpongeBob says: "You know, you guys are right."
SpongeBob says: "It was silly to think I could be in 3 places at once."
Sandy says: "Nonsense, SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "Of course you can, if you'll just step into the Protogenerator 2000!"
SpongeBob #2 says: "D'oh!"
SpongeBob #3 says: "D'oh!"
Sandy says: "As you can see, I've made two clones of my subject which will allow him to honor all of the commitments he's made this evening."
