French narrator says: "Closing time at the Krusty Krab."
Mr. Krabs says: "51, 52, 53..."
Squidward says: "29, 30, 31..."
SpongeBob says: "One, two, three."
SpongeBob says: "One, two, three."
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, can we please go now?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Perhaps, one of our more loyal workers can enlighten you on company policy."
SpongeBob says: ""The Krusty Krab Employee Manual; 2nd Revised Edition; Page 35; Section 19; Clause 3a, states: All staff must remain on the premises until the day's receipts are fully accounted for."
Squidward says: "But that's not fair!"
SpongeBob says: ""Clause 3b: The proprietor reserves the right to be unfair."
Squidward says: "Teacher's pet."
Mr. Krabs says: "Let's see..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Where is it?"
Squidward says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "My dime!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Me special dime, the first dime I ever made!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I always keep it in the back of the register for luck!"
Squidward says: "Well, I've never seen it."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hmm, are you prepared to say that with your hand on a stack of interpretive dance quarterlies?"
Squidward says: "Of course I'm..."
Squidward says: "What are you saying?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Me?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I ain't saying nothing that would matter to anyone who would be willing to take a lie detector test!"
Squidward says: "You're saying something!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Heavens to Betsy, no."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's just that me lucky dime's gone missing and you've been working the register all day!"
Squidward says: "Are you accusing me of something?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, the way I see it, there are three possibilities: One, you stole it."
Mr. Krabs says: "Two, you stole it."
Mr. Krabs says: "Or threeâ€”"
Mr. Krabs says: "you stole it!"
Squidward says: "I didn't take your precious dime!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Show me your tentacles."
Squidward says: "What?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I wanna see empty suction cups."
Mr. Krabs says: "You..."
Mr. Krabs says: "you can't do that to me."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm your boss!"
Squidward says: "Not anymore, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs."
Squidward says: "I quit!"
Squidward says: "I'm outta here!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, you're making a big mistake!"
Squidward says: "Mistake?"
Squidward says: "Ha!"
Squidward says: "The only mistake I ever made was wasting my life at the Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy."
SpongeBob says: "And what could be better than serving up smiles?"
Squidward says: "Being dead or anything else!"
SpongeBob says: "I never knew you felt so strongly about this."
Squidward says: "Where have you been?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I guess I can't stop you."
SpongeBob says: "But Squidward, it's a cold, cold world out there."
SpongeBob says: "No one's going to serve you happiness on a silver platter."
Norma Rechid says: "Free sample?"
SpongeBob says: "Cookies!"
Squidward says: "Can I have one?"
SpongeBob says: "Anyways, I just want you to know, if you ever get in trouble, come find me."
SpongeBob says: "I'll take care of you."
SpongeBob says: "'Cause you and me..."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, I don't need your help."
Squidward says: "I am ready to unlock my potential."
Squidward says: "I could be anything I set my mind to."
Squidward says: "I could be a football player, or a king, or a spaceman."
SpongeBob says: "Or a football playing king in space..."
SpongeBob says: "with a mustache."
Squidward says: "Spare change?"
Squidward says: "Spare change, ma'am?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, is that you?"
Squidward says: "Uh, I, uh..."
SpongeBob says: "It's me, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "We used to work together."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "There ya go."
SpongeBob says: "So, where you living these days?"
Fish says: "Squidward Tentacles?"
Squidward says: "Yes?"
Fish says: "Sign here, please."
Squidward says: "Uh..."
Squidward says: "nowhere."
SpongeBob says: "Great."
SpongeBob says: "And what have you been doing with yourself?"
SpongeBob says: "No, wait, let me guess!"
SpongeBob says: "Hmmm..."
SpongeBob says: "I see you've been working on that mustache, the tattered clothes, the awful smell..."
SpongeBob says: "you're a football player?"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "A spaceman?"
Squidward says: "No."
Squidward says: "Don't you get it?"
Squidward says: "I'm a loser!"
Squidward says: "I lost my job, my home, everything!"
SpongeBob says: "Even your paintings?"
Squidward says: "Nobody would take them."
Squidward says: "So I had to eat them."
SpongeBob says: "There, there."
SpongeBob says: "You can come live with me."
Squidward says: "Okay, but just until I get a job."
Squidward says: "One day..."
Squidward says: "two days tops."
SpongeBob says: "Breakfast is ready!"
SpongeBob says: "You're gonna need to build up your strength again so I laid out a big buffet for you."
Squidward says: "And in bed, too?"
Squidward says: "Aw, thanks, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, I..."
SpongeBob says: "Ahh!"
SpongeBob says: "Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."
SpongeBob says: "Here comes the plane."
Squidward says: "It's really nice of you to help me in my time of need."
Squidward says: "I'll try not to be a burden."
SpongeBob says: "It's no trouble."
SpongeBob says: "Is there anything else I can do for you, winner?"
Squidward says: "No, no, no."
Squidward says: "You've already..."
Squidward says: "well..."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, wow."
SpongeBob says: "Nurturing a broken spirit sure is a lot of work."
SpongeBob says: "Good night, Gary."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, can I get a glass of water?"
Squidward says: "Thank you."
SpongeBob says: "Good night."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, could I get some more blankets?"
SpongeBob says: "Here you go."
Squidward says: "Thank you."
SpongeBob says: "Good night."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward is not a freeloader and he would never take advantage of me."
French narrator says: "Three weeks later..."
French narrator says: "Many months later..."
British Narrator says: "So much later that the old narrator got tired of waiting and they had to hire a new one..."
SpongeBob drags himself into the room, by now utterly exhausted. Gary doesn't look sympathetic, though.
Gary says: "Meow, meow, meow."
SpongeBob says: "I know he still isn't looking for work!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't rub it in!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, where's my lemonade?"
SpongeBob says: "Coming, Squidward."
Squidward says: "It's about time you got here!"
SpongeBob says: "Here you go, Your Majesty."
Squidward says: "I can't drink that."
SpongeBob says: "Why not?"
Squidward says: "Are you blind?"
Squidward says: "Just look at it."
SpongeBob says: "What about it?"
Squidward says: "That lemon has three seeds in it."
Squidward says: "That's an odd number!"
Squidward says: "I can't eat anything odd numbered."
SpongeBob says: "Fine, I'll just take it out."
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "It's already contaminated by the bad lemon!"
Squidward says: "It won't work!"
Squidward says: "Then go fix them."
Squidward says: "I've changed my mind."
Squidward says: "I want soup instead."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, don't move."
Squidward says: "Condensed soup from a can?"
Squidward says: "Disgusting!"
Squidward says: "Now you've ruined my appetite!"
Squidward says: "Go fetch me something to read!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, okay."
SpongeBob says: "How about this?"
Squidward says: "Get that away from me!"
Squidward says: "You know I'm allergic to newsprint!"
Squidward says: "4:00."
Squidward says: "Time for my stories."
Squidward says: "Hurry up, they won't hold the show while you laze around."
Puppet #1 says: "Hey, where are you going?"
Puppet #2 says: "To my job."
Puppet #1 says: "You have a job?"
Puppet #2 says: "Why wouldn't I?"
Puppet #2 says: "I'm not some lazy, inconsiderate jerk who lays in bed all day."
Puppet #1 says: "Say, where can I get one of these..."
Puppet #1 says: "jobs?"
Puppet #2 says: "Oh, they're everywhere."
Puppet #2 says: "Especially if you're green and have six tentacles."
Puppet #1 says: "Thanks."
Puppet #1 says: "I'm gonna go look for one, so I can stop..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "mooching off my friends and they can get back to their lives!"
Squidward says: "This isn't my show."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, the remote control is broken!"
Squidward says: "Get over here and fix it!"
Squidward says: "What are you saying?"
This turns out to be the last straw. Outside, it is day. SpongeBob's house jumps into the air before the side is smashed out as a furious SpongeBob pushes the bed, with Squidward still in it, outside and towards the Krusty Krab while screaming in total fury.
SpongeBob says: "You want your dime back?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Wrong!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That ain't my first dime."
SpongeBob says: "Then have some more dimes!"
SpongeBob says: "I've got plenty of 'em!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You can't put a price on me first dime!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And I can't forgive that thieving bilge rat Squidward for stealing it!"
SpongeBob says: "What's that?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, Dimey, I'll never lose you again."
SpongeBob says: "This is a dime?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I've been in business a long time, boy."
SpongeBob says: "So, if Squidward never stole the dime, he can come back to work, right?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Aye, lad, just let the dime and me have our privacy."
SpongeBob says: "Yeeee-aah-hoooo!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward, it's good to have ya back."
Squidward says: "Well, it's kind of good to be back, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's all water under the bridge now."
Squidward says: "I agree, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "After all, I'm sure ya didn't mean to misplace me dime."
Squidward says: "What the..."
Squidward says: "What are you saying?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, it's obvious that ya put the dime in me pants."
Mr. Krabs says: "Dimes just don't fly into people's pants."
Squidward says: "Are you accusing me of something?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, the way I see it, there are three possibilities: One, you put the dime in me pants."
Mr. Krabs says: "Two, you put the dime in me pants."
Mr. Krabs says: "Or three, you put the dime in me pants!"
