A book entitled "The Legend of SpongeBob SquarePants" is on a wooden type platform.
Patchy says: "Ahoy, mateys!"
Patchy says: "Today I'll be spinning a tale you won't soon forget."
Patchy says: "It's called "SpongeBob SquarePants Vs."
Patchy says: "The Patty Gadget"."
Patchy says: "Now, SpongeBob was workin', his eye on the grill, 'til he heard a sharp sound that gave him a chill."
SpongeBob says: "What's going on?"
SpongeBob says: "What could it mean?"
Patchy says: "Wow, it's a deep-fry patty cookin' machine!"
Squidward says: "Hey!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's is this contraption you've hauled into me place?"
Squidward says: "A miracle, a marvel!"
Squidward says: "It'll cook Krabby Patties at a fabulous pace!"
Mr. Krabs says: "But how are the patties?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I mean, how do they taste?"
Squidward says: "I'll let you try one."
Squidward says: "Shove this in your face."
Mr. Krabs says: "I have to admit, that patty was yummy, though it sits like a rock when it lands in me tummy."
Mr. Krabs says: "But I've got me a fry cook, and he's always on time."
Squidward says: "Ah, but this gizmo is faster, and you won't pay it a dime."
Mr. Krabs says: "Your machine sounds delightful."
Mr. Krabs says: "But how much does it cost?"
Squidward says: "Hmm, just fire SpongeBob and tell him, "Get lost!"
Patchy says: "The machine wanted his job to make SpongeBob quit."
Patchy says: "But SpongeBob didn't like it."
Patchy says: "No, not one bit."
Patchy says: "Pushing his grill, SpongeBob burst through the door."
SpongeBob says: "I challenge your gadget!"
SpongeBob says: "I declare patty war!"
Patchy says: "With three little words, Krabs started the show."
Patchy says: "Flag raised in the air, he cried..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ready, set, go!"
Patchy says: "Quick as a flash, Squidward pulled the big lever, and sat back and watched feeling oh so quite clever."
Patchy says: "SpongeBob, with spatula held tight in his fist, flung twenty patties, not a single one missed."
Patchy says: "The crowd was impressed."
Sandy says: "Wow!"
Patchy says: "They cheered full of glee!"
Patchy says: "All except Patrick, who had to go pee."
Patchy says: "A noise and a clatter came from the machine, and out popped the patties in a burst of hot steam."
Patchy says: "The gadget was fast, its first batch completed, but SpongeBob yelled out..."
SpongeBob says: "I won't be defeated!"
Patchy says: "He took in some air."
Patchy says: "SpongeBob swelled his physique."
Patchy says: "Then dozens of patties filled up his cheeks."
Patchy says: "He strained and he sweated."
Patchy says: "He summoned his will, and shot Krabby Patties right onto the grill!"
Squidward says: "Not bad!"
Patchy says: "Yelled out Squidward."
Squidward says: "A really good try."
Squidward says: "But let's see how you do against my machine set on high!"
Narrator says: "The gizmo, it shuddered, it clattered, it shook!"
Squidward says: "Ha-ha!"
Patchy says: "Sandy said..."
Sandy says: "What a schnook!"
Patchy says: "But SpongeBob cried out..."
SpongeBob says: "I won't lose to that thing!"
Patchy says: "Then he raised up two spatulas and leapt like a spring."
Patchy says: "His hands were a blur, the patties went flying."
Patchy says: "He fried up a hundred without even trying."
Patchy says: "Squidward was worried, SpongeBob couldn't be beat!"
Squidward says: "I got one last chance, I'll turn up the heat!"
Patchy says: "He struggled and strained 'til his face turned dark blue."
Patchy says: "Then the lever moved forward and broke right in two!"
Patchy says: "The gadget buckled and sparked, it cracked like a gun."
Patchy says: "So Squidward took off, yelling..."
Squidward says: "Let me know if I've won!"
Patchy says: "Lightning flew from its maw, it looked ready to burst."
Patchy says: "But SpongeBob, still standing, yelled..."
SpongeBob says: "Foul beast, do your worst!"
Patchy says: "The patties came flying, by twos and by threes, by dozens, by hundreds, oh, it was something to see!"
Patchy says: "Aye, that machine, it was fast, but SpongeBob was faster."
Patchy says: "He proved to that thing that he was its master!"
Patchy says: "It was all over, finished and done."
Patchy says: "With his head held up high, SpongeBob knew he had won."
Patchy says: "The crowd yelled, "Hooray, Squidward's name is now mud!"
Patchy says: "" But as they were cheering, SpongeBob fell with a thud."
SpongeBob says: "Whoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
Patchy says: "What's that?"
Patchy says: "You thought SpongeBob was buried down there?"
Patchy says: "They just buried the gadget!"
Patchy says: "Ha-ha!"
Patchy says: "This I swear!"
Patchy says: "Well, that ends me tale, straight from the book."
Patchy says: "Now I gotta go and polish me hook!"
