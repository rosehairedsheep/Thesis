SpongeBob says: "Aww, no one's wishes are coming true."
SpongeBob says: "What did we do wrong?"
SpongeBob says: "I know I believe hard enough."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe I just didn't dig deep enough."
SpongeBob says: "What do you say, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Are you ready to dig for some magic?"
Patrick says: "Yeah."
SpongeBob says: "♪Oh, the magic has gone missin' and everyone's still wishin but their dreams have fallen flat upon the ground."

Patrick says: "Yeah you should work out more."
Squidward says: "Well why don't I just start right now?"
Squidward says: "After all I got a couple of dumbbells right here."
Patrick says: "I don't get it."
Squidward says: "Could you not stand so close?"
Squidward says: "You're making me claustrophobic."
Patrick says: "What does claustrophobic mean?"

SpongeBob says: "We dug down deeper in the well and found the magic."
SpongeBob says: "Now all the wishes will come true!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Listen closely, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "You don't get what you want in life just by wishing for it."
Mr. Krabs says: "What in the deep blue is that?"
Sandy says: "There's a full moon out tonight."
Sandy says: "Do you like my new telescope I wished for?"
SpongeBob says: "That's great, Sandy!"
Sandy says: "That wishing well sure does work."
Mr. Krabs says: "Just a coincidence."
Mrs. Puff says: "What do you think of my new hot rod?"
SpongeBob says: "It's beautiful Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff."
SpongeBob says: "How's about letting me take it for a spin?"
Mrs. Puff says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "See Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "She wished for that boat."
Mr. Krabs says: "You mean she stole that boat."
SpongeBob says: "Is that proof enough for ya?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You'll never get me to believe in magic, never!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Just to prove it to ya."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, where's your magic now?"
