The episode starts at the Krusty Krab; SpongeBob counts down the seconds remaining on his watch as Mr. Krabs prepares to unlock the door.
SpongeBob says: "7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, whoa!"
SpongeBob says: "Open for business!"
Squidward says: "Yeah, whoo."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, can I do it today?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Can I?"
SpongeBob says: "Can I do it?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I suppose you can have the honor today, lad."
SpongeBob turns the closed sign to open and laughs and whoops.
SpongeBob says: "Freshness, check."
SpongeBob says: "Buns, check."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, fine, stay."
SpongeBob says: "But I hope you like making Krabby Patties."
Nat says: "Excuse me, sir, but, um, I ordered a couple Krabby Patties a while ago, and I'm wondering when they'll be out."
Peterson says: "So, will they be ready soon?"
Squidward says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Squidward says: "Don't move too much, it ruins it."
Squidward says: "I hear you!"
Squidward says: "I hear you!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, good, 'cause these two Krabby Patties are ready!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes?"
Squidward says: "Can I ask you something?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes."
SpongeBob says: "What's what?"
Squidward says: "You know."
SpongeBob says: "Know what?"
Squidward says: "This."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Squidward says: "This thing here."
SpongeBob says: "What thing where?"
Squidward says: "The spatula TIED TO YOUR NOSE!"
SpongeBob says: "Makes sense now, huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Good one, Squiddy."
Squidward says: "Wait a minute."
Squidward says: "Did you say that you got that splinter injury at work?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
Squidward says: "Oh, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk."
Squidward says: "That's not good."
SpongeBob says: "I know, it hurts so bad."
Squidward says: "Yeah, when Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs finds out, oh, man."
SpongeBob says: "Finds out what?"
Squidward says: "Finds out about this injury."
SpongeBob says: "You mean my splinter?"
Squidward says: "He'll be forced to send you home."
SpongeBob says: "H-h-h-h-home?"
SpongeBob says: "But I'm fine!"
Squidward says: "Here, let me take this for you."
SpongeBob says: "Why?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, wait, I'm fine!"
Squidward says: "It was a good shift while it lasted."
SpongeBob says: "While it lasted?"
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing?"
SpongeBob says: "W..."
SpongeBob says: "What are you..."
SpongeBob says: "?"
Squidward says: "I know it's hard to say goodbye."
SpongeBob says: "But, but, but, Squidward, I'm fine!"
SpongeBob says: "See?"
SpongeBob says: "See?"
Squidward says: "Oh, I believe you, SpongeBob, but, unfortunately,  the rules clearly state that you must be sent home."
SpongeBob says: "No, anything but that."
SpongeBob says: "You can't let them force me away!"
Squidward says: "Sorry, the rules are the rules."
SpongeBob says: "Please, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't tell Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "Me?"
Squidward says: "Tell Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs?"
Squidward says: "Oh, no."
Squidward says: "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Whew."
Squidward says: "Well, maybe."
Squidward says: "I don't have to tell Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "He does?"
Squidward says: "Oh, yeah."
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs has preturnatural instincts when it comes to situations like this."
Squidward says: "It's almost as if when something's amiss in his restaurant..."
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "he can smell it."
SpongeBob and Squidward look out the kitchen window at Mr. Krabs, who is sniffing around. Mr. Krabs smells Frankie's wallet, and two quarters get stuck in his nostrils.
Mr. Krabs says: "These quarters smell sad."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're not planning on getting a refill with them, are ya?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Frankie says: "No, I wasn't."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Yeah?"
SpongeBob says: "Thank goodness you're there."
SpongeBob says: "I got a splinter on my thumb and..."
Patrick says: "Mm-hmm."
Patrick says: "I see."
Patrick says: "Well, I'm pretty booked today, but I think I can fit you in."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Patrick."
Patrick says: "No problem."
SpongeBob says: "Uh, Patrick..."
Patrick says: "Hmmm..."
Patrick says: "interesting."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, this isn't helping!"
Patrick says: "Oh, I'm sorry."
Patrick says: "I didn't realize you were a doctor."
Patrick says: "Hmph!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm not!"
Patrick says: "Oh, but I'm sure you can figure it out with your 12 years of med school."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you didn't go to med school."
Patrick says: "So?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I'm sorry."
SpongeBob says: "I really need your help."
Patrick says: "Oh, no, no, it looks like you have things under control."
SpongeBob says: "Please, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't want to go home early!"
Patrick says: "Okay."
Patrick says: "But we play by my rules, SquareBob."
Patrick says: "We're gonna make it go away."
SpongeBob says: "Phew, thanks, Patrick, you're a lifesaver."
Patrick says: "There appears to be a little bit of swelling."
SpongeBob says: "Ah."
Mr. Krabs says: "What's that?"
SpongeBob says: "What's what?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Behind your back?"
SpongeBob says: "You mean this?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Put your hat on, boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Show some company pride!"
SpongeBob says: "Heh, company pride, of course."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Have you always had three legs?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes."
Mr. Krabs says: "Whew."
Mr. Krabs says: "For a second there, I thought I was gonna have to pay you workman's "compersation."
SpongeBob says: "What's worker's compensation?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You know, when you get paid for sitting at home."
Squidward says: "You mean I can get paid while I'm at home?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, what do ya' think "compersation" stands for?"
Squidward says: "Ow!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Can I get my "compersation" now?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No."
Mr. Krabs says: "Sorry, Squidward, your shift ended over two minutes ago."
Squidward groans, then the episode ends.
