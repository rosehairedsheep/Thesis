Patrick says: "Oh, boy, am I!"
SpongeBob says: "Here's your net."
SpongeBob says: "Well, come on, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "The jellyfish don't catch themselves."
Patrick says: "First, I have to put away my secret box."
SpongeBob says: "Secret box?"
SpongeBob says: "You never told me about your..."
SpongeBob says: "secret box!"
Patrick says: "Hey, hands off, PeepingBob!"
Patrick says: "This here is my secret box!"
Patrick says: "Besides, if I showed you what was inside, it wouldn't be a secret anymore."
Patrick says: "Duh!"
SpongeBob says: "It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets."
Patrick says: "You do?"
SpongeBob says: "I've got a gazillion secrets!"
Patrick says: "Like what?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, it's no secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets."
SpongeBob says: "Secretly."
SpongeBob says: "You wanna hear one of my secrets?"
Patrick says: "Do I?"
SpongeBob says: "Uhh..."
SpongeBob says: "Let's see..."
Patrick says: "No..."
Patrick says: "way."
Patrick says: "Oh, let's hear another one!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "Uhh..."
SpongeBob says: "Secretly..."
SpongeBob says: "I'm a little bit naïve."
Patrick says: "Wow!"
Patrick says: "I'll never look at you the same way again, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "Gosh."
Patrick says: "Tell me some more secrets!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think jellyfishing and bubble-blowing are the..."
Patrick says: "Gasp."
Patrick says: "I never would have guessed."
SpongeBob says: "Now will you show me what's inside your secret box?"
Patrick says: "No, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "It's for me to know and for you to never find out."
Patrick says: "You may be an open book, SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that."
Patrick says: "The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I got plenty of secret stuff, too!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh…  What do you think of that, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "What do you think you're doing?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "That's my secret box!"
Patrick says: "Now, hand it over!"
SpongeBob says: "But, Patrick, I must know the secret!"
Patrick says: "For the last time, SpongeBob, no!"
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Patrick, just a peek?"
Patrick says: "Never!"
Patrick says: "If you ever come near my secret box again, we won't be friends anymore!"
SpongeBob says: "But..."
SpongeBob says: "we're supposed to be..."
SpongeBob says: "I know it's your secret!"
SpongeBob says: "I promise to respect that!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, please forgive me, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Please!"
Patrick says: "Well..."
Patrick says: "I guess it's not all your fault."
Patrick says: "After all, this is a pretty great secret."
Patrick says: "I mean, how could you resist the greatest secret ever?"
SpongeBob says: "So, what do you say, buddy?"
SpongeBob says: "Friends?"
Patrick says: "Friends."
SpongeBob says: "What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see?"
SpongeBob says: "Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish..."
Gary says: "Meeh… No."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, what do you know?"
SpongeBob says: "You're a snail!"
Patrick says: "Seee..."
Patrick says: "cret."
Patrick says: "Duh..."
Patrick says: "who's there?"
Patrick says: "Eh?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper."
Patrick says: "Huh?"
Patrick says: "Who said that?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "Who's there?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "It's the Clam Burglar!"
Patrick says: "And he's stealing my secret box!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait, wait, wait, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Stop!"
SpongeBob says: "It's me, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Nice try, burglar, but SpongeBob's my best friend, and he'd never steal from me."
SpongeBob says: "No, really, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Look!"
SpongeBob says: "It's the Best Friends Forever, Best Friends Forever Ring!"
Patrick BFF Ring says: "It's the Best Friends Forever, Best Friends Forever Ring!"
Patrick says: "Our friendship ring!"
Patrick says: "It is you!"
Patrick says: "How could you do thi-i-i-i-is?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside."
Patrick says: "That's it, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "You have crossed the line."
Patrick says: "As of right now, this friendship is over!"
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
Patrick says: "Nahhh, you can look inside it if you really want to."
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, this is one of the most exciting moments of my life!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, here it goes!"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
Patrick says: "Well, didn't I tell ya?"
Patrick says: "Isn't it great?"
SpongeBob says: "It's just a string."
Patrick says: "A secret string!"
SpongeBob says: "Boy, when you're right, you're right!"
SpongeBob says: "That's some secret box you've got there!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for showing me that!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, good night, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "See you tomorrow!"
Patrick says: "Good night, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "I should've known!"
SpongeBob says: "It was just a piece of string all along!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait 'till I tell Gary!"
