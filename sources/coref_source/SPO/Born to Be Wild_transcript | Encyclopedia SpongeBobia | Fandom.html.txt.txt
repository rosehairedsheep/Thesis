The beginning opens up to bikers riding by coral, setting them on fire as they ride by.
SpongeBob says: "Bye "Ild Ones."
SpongeBob says: "" I like your silly name."
SpongeBob says: "Hmm..."
SpongeBob says: ""w."
SpongeBob says: "" Oh, oh, they're not the "Ild Ones."
SpongeBob says: "" They must be the "Wild Ones."
Fish says: "The Wild Ones?!"
Fish says: "!"
Fish says: "Tar nation!"
Fish says: "Don't you know who the Wild Ones are, son?!"
Fish says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "No; I don't know who you are, either."
Fish says: "Why, they're the most ferocious, bloodthirsty biker gang under the sea."
Fish says: "They've destroyed entire cities in an afternoon!"
SpongeBob says: "Bloodthirsty bikers?"
SpongeBob says: "And they're headed straight for Bikini Bottom!"
SpongeBob says: "I've got to warn everybody!"
SpongeBob says: "I better take the shortcut!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Where in the blue barnacles did you come from?"
SpongeBob says: "There's no time for that, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Grab something heavy!"
SpongeBob says: "Bar the door!"
SpongeBob says: "Board up the windows."
SpongeBob says: "We've got to protect the Krusty Krab."
SpongeBob says: "The Krabby Patties must survive!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Settle down, son."
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you all riled up about?"
SpongeBob says: "Bikers..."
SpongeBob says: "coming..."
SpongeBob says: "nasty..."
SpongeBob says: "ferocious..."
SpongeBob says: "take..."
SpongeBob says: "over..."
SpongeBob says: "town."
SpongeBob says: "Destroy..."
SpongeBob says: "must hide!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you going on about?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Bikers?"
SpongeBob says: "The Wild Ones are coming, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "They're the most vicious, ravenous horde of hooligans in the sea."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ravenous did you say?"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's another word for hungry, isn't it?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Welcome Wild Ones!"
Mr. Krabs says: "They'll be drawn here like a sailor at a tattoo parlor."
Mr. Krabs says: "With the special biker parking and authentic biker decor, with real bloodstains."
Mr. Krabs says: "And to top it off, a custom chopper patty."
Mr. Krabs says: "And best of all, I'll raise me prices 150%."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll make a fortune."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, this is serious!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That kid needs a vacation -- unpaid of course."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Yes, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "A horrible biker gang called the "Wild Ones" are coming."
SpongeBob says: "We've got to run, hide!"
Squidward says: "Oh, my."
Squidward says: "This sounds serious."
Squidward says: "Luckily, I know just what you should do."
Squidward says: "Listen closely."
SpongeBob says: "Uh-huh."
Squidward says: "Get a good grip on your pants."
SpongeBob says: "Like this, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "That's it."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Hello, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, an evil gang of bikers are coming to ravage Bikini Bottom."
Patrick says: "Huh."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, didn't you hear what I said?"
Patrick says: "Oh, I heard you."
Patrick says: "But what didn't hear was a hello."
SpongeBob says: "Hello, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Hello, SpongeBob."
Giant Clam #2 says: "Hey, what happened to you?"
Patrick says: "Hide me!"
SpongeBob says: "No, hide me!"
Patrick says: "Hide me!"
SpongeBob says: "Me!"
Patrick says: "No, me!"
SpongeBob says: "Me!"
Patrick says: "Me!"
SpongeBob says: "Me!"
Patrick says: "No!"
Patrick says: "No more running."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Patrick says: "Those bikers think they're so tough."
SpongeBob says: "Their leather socks."
Patrick says: "If we dressed up like that, then we'd be the big, scary bikers and they'd be little baby doody-heads."
SpongeBob says: "Say that again, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Little baby doody-heads?"
SpongeBob says: "No, no, not that part."
SpongeBob says: "The part about dressing up like big, scary bikers."
SpongeBob says: "What do you think, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Do I look tough?"
Patrick says: "I wouldn't mess with ya."
SpongeBob says: "Nor I with you, my friend."
SpongeBob says: "Let's ride."
SpongeBob says: "Fear not."
SpongeBob says: "There is no need to panic."
SpongeBob says: "The Bikini Bottom bad boys are here."
Harold says: "Ooh, I feel protected now."
Scooter says: "Those are some mean looking rides, dudes."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, it's working."
SpongeBob says: "They think we're..."
SpongeBob says: "vicious bikers."
SpongeBob says: "Bikini Bottom, your salvation is here."
Patrick says: "See?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, that's your salivation."
Patrick says: "Oh."
SpongeBob says: "So, Squidward, are you ready to do your part?"
Squidward says: "Does that part include laughing at you?"
Squidward says: "â€˜Cause you two look even more idiotic than usual."
SpongeBob says: "Don't we look vicious and bloodthirsty?"
Patrick says: "I'm bloodthirsty."
Patrick says: "See?"
Patrick says: "Want some?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, no thank you, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I'm drinking diet blood."
SpongeBob says: "See, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "We walk the walk, but can we talk the talk?"
SpongeBob says: "Do you want to join our biker gang?"
Squidward says: "No, I don't."
Patrick says: "What about our biker club?"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "How about our biker organization?"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "I don't want to join your biker alliance, your outfits, or your fellowships."
SpongeBob says: "What about our coalition?"
Patrick says: "Ooh, I don't know."
Patrick says: "That one's pretty exclusive."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "We're the Bikini Bottom bad boys and we're bad to the bone."
Mr. Krabs says: "This'll be great."
Mr. Krabs says: "Those bikers can work up an appetite beating you up in the parking lot."
Mr. Krabs says: "Then they can fill up on delicious Krabby Patties then they can beat you up again."
SpongeBob says: "Please, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "We're going to run off those bikers and save the Krusty Krab."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're not running off any of me paying customers."
Mr. Krabs says: "You can stay and get beat up in the parking lot if you wish."
SpongeBob says: "Then can we save the town?"
Squidward says: "Has it ever crossed your mind that you might be getting all worked up over nothing?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, when have I ever been known to over-react?"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, you always over-react to everything."
Squidward says: "It's one of your many annoying traits."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, right."
Squidward says: "What was that?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ahoy there, mateys."
Mr. Krabs says: "Motorized vehicles headed over the horizon."
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "Don't just stand there, save us!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I know this looks like the end, but you and I can get through anything."
SpongeBob says: "As long as we do it together."
SpongeBob says: "Well, it's just you and me, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "But I want you to know that we can get through this."
SpongeBob says: "As long as we..."
Squidward says: "Panic!"
Squidward says: "Run for your lives!"
Lenny says: "The Wild Ones?"
Charlie says: "Honey, I got the napkins."
Charlie says: "Oh, what have I missed this time?"
Squidward says: "I'll do whatever you want."
Squidward says: "I'll betray my friends and neighbors."
Squidward says: "Just let me live."
Biker #1 says: "What's that, missy?"
Biker #2 says: "What?"
Biker #1 says: "Howdy, we're the "Mild Ones"."
SpongeBob says: "Mild Ones?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
Biker #1 says: "Gimme back my M."
Biker #1 says: "Let's go, boys."
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't you want to spend any money?"
Biker #1 says: "Don't you want to kiss the seat of my pants?"
Biker #1 says: "Let's ride."
SpongeBob says: "Goodbye."
SpongeBob says: "They seem really nice."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, where's Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Woo-hoo-hoo!"
Squidward says: "Ride to live and live to ride!"
