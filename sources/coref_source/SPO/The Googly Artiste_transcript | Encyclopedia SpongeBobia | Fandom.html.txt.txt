SpongeBob says: "Oh, hi, Squid..."
SpongeBob says: "I love your hat."
Squidward says: "Don't touch it!"
Squidward says: "And it's not a hat."
Squidward says: "It's a beret."
SpongeBob says: "A beret?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, where can I get one?"
Squidward says: "Sorry, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Berets are only worn for true artists, like moi."
Patrick says: "You're an artist?"
Squidward says: "Yes, I'm an artist!"
Squidward says: "What are you two bubbleheads doing anyway?"
SpongeBob says: "We're making arts and crafts."
SpongeBob says: "I've been learning the fine art of basket weaving."
SpongeBob says: "And I also made this cute little scallop house."
Squidward says: "So, you've been counterfeiting currency?"
Squidward says: "And what's doorknob number two been up to?"
Patrick says: "Darn!"
Patrick says: "This hammer is defective."
SpongeBob says: "Do you want to make crafts, too?"
Squidward says: "Crafts?"
Patrick says: "Oh, man."
Patrick says: "I'll never make art like you and..."
Patrick says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, don't be sad."
SpongeBob says: "You can be an artist, too."
SpongeBob says: "I'll find something that will tap into your particular artistic skill set."
Patrick says: "Uh."
SpongeBob says: "A little glue..."
Patrick says: "Uh."
SpongeBob says: "Stick on a couple of googly eyes..."
Patrick says: "Whoa."
Patrick says: "Slow down, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "And presto: A rock with googly eyes!"
Patrick says: "Whoa."
Patrick says: "I did not see that coming!"
SpongeBob says: "Now you try!"
Patrick says: "I'm scared."
SpongeBob says: "You can do this!"
Patrick says: "I shall make the attempt!"
Patrick says: "Privacy, please?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, sorry."

Nitpick shows up.
Frederick Nitpick says: "Why, hello, Mr."
Frederick Nitpick says: "Tentacles!"
Frederick Nitpick says: "I'm Frederick T."
Frederick Nitpick says: "Nitpick, world famous art critic!"
Frederick Nitpick says: "This is your artwork, I presume?"
Squidward says: "Oh, it certainly is!"
Squidward says: "This piece represents my struggle to reveal my genius to a moronic world."
Squidward says: "Witness "La Visti Squidward"!"
Squidward says: "Stunning, isn't it?"
Frederick Nitpick says: "My considered opinion is "Eww!"
Frederick Nitpick says: "" I'll have to confiscate your artist beret."
Nitpick pulls off Squidward's beret.
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "No, you can't do that!"

Patrick says: "I'm an artist!"
Patrick says: "Hooray!"
Frederick Nitpick says: "An artist, eh?"
Squidward says: "No, wait, come back!"
Frederick Nitpick says: "Now, which one of you two is the artiste?"
Squidward runs over.
SpongeBob says: "We both are."
SpongeBob says: "It's lots of fun!"
SpongeBob says: "Would you like to make something, too?"
Nitpick laughs heavily.
Frederick Nitpick says: "I'm a critic."
Frederick Nitpick says: "I don't make things."
Frederick Nitpick says: "I judge things."
Frederick Nitpick says: "I’m a judger."
Frederick Nitpick says: "For instance, I judge your work."
Patrick says: "Don't judge me!"
Frederick Nitpick says: "Holy guacamole frijoles!"
Frederick Nitpick says: "It's so, so, primitive and naïve!"
Frederick Nitpick says: "You're a genius!"
Patrick says: "Is that good?"
Frederick Nitpick says: "I'll give you 500 bucks for it!"
Frederick Nitpick says: "And this hat!"
Squidward says: "Hey!"
Squidward says: "You can't give that dunderhead the artist hat!"
Frederick Nitpick says: "Who's the critic here?"
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "Did you hear that, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick is an artist!"
Squidward says: "Oh,  selling one lousy piece doesn't make you an artist!"
SpongeBob says: "How many lousy pieces have you sold, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Well, about..."
Squidward says: "um, um, well, I'll bet he never sells another one of those ridiculous trinkets!"
Ted says: "Hey there, I noticed your hat."
Ted says: "Are you an artist?"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
Ted says: "Do you have any art?"
Ted says: "I have a real craving for creativity!"
Patrick says: "Um..."
Patrick says: "okay!"
Ted says: "Thanks, man!"
Ted says: "Here's fifty bucks!"
Squidward says: "I'll bet he never sells another!"
Sally says: "Hey, Ted!"
Sally says: "Where'd you get that art?"
Ted says: "From that pink genius over there!"
Sally says: "I want to buy one!"
Nat says: "Me too!"
Man says: "I also!"
Squidward says: "I'll bet."
Squidward says: "I actually want to go to work today!"
Patrick says: "So long, my dear, earnest, yet untalented friend!"
Patrick says: "I've run out of rocks to put googly eyes on!"
Patrick says: "I've run out of rocks!"
Harold says: "Got anything else?"
Patrick says: "Um, the artist needs alone time!"
Harold says: "He's so eccentric!"
Patrick says: "I'm all out of rocks!"
Patrick says: "What am I going to do now?"
Patrick says: "That was my thing!"
Patrick says: "Oh!"
Patrick says: "The artist needs a lunch break!"
Squidward says: "Oh, not you again!"
Squidward says: "May I take your order?"
Patrick says: "Um!"
Patrick says: "Uh!"
Patrick says: "I'm thinking about having a Krabby Patty."
Patrick says: "But I'm wondering if that might be too predictable!"
Squidward says: "Then, what do you want?"
Patrick says: "I don't know!"
Patrick says: "I'm not feeling very inspired at the moment!"
SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen.
SpongeBob says: "Hiya, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Ordering up a delicious Krabby Patty?"
Patrick says: "Maybe, I don't know!"
Patrick says: "I'm in a creative slump!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Patrick, that's terrible."
Squidward says: "Just order already!"
Patrick says: "Okay, I want new ideas to satisfy a public hunger for my goodly goods!"
Squidward says: "Off the menu!"
Squidward says: "Choose something off the menu!"
Squidward says: "We don't serve artistic advice here!"
Patrick says: "Well, then, why is it on the menu?"
Squidward looks at menu to see "Artistic Advice" written on the menu.
Squidward says: "Huh?"
Squidward says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get back to work, Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Oh, you can borrow mine!"
Squidward says: "Beautiful."
SpongeBob says: "Make yourself comfortable, Mister Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Our artistic consultant will be right with you!"
SpongeBob brings Squidward to table against his will.
SpongeBob says: "This is Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Tentacles."
SpongeBob says: "He'll be handling all your artistic advice needs!"
Squidward says: "Mm-hmm!"
Patrick says: "Mm-hmm."
Patrick says: "Pleasure!"
SpongeBob says: "Here's your Krabby Patty!"
SpongeBob says: "Shall I put it on your tab?"
Patrick says: "Oh, yeah."
Patrick says: "Keep it open."
Patrick says: "We might be here all night!"
Patrick says: "Let me just say up front, I'm a fan!"
Patrick says: "I'm excited to learn from a master."
Patrick says: "My career in self-worth are in your hands!"
Patrick says: "Let us writing on this."
Patrick says: "Okay..."
Patrick says: "advise!"
Frederick Nitpick says: "Brilliant!"
SpongeBob says: "You did it, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "You found your inspiration!"
Patrick says: "And I'm going to need some more of those patty thingies!"
SpongeBob says: "You got it, buddy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's the meaning of this?"
Patrick says: "It's my art."
Patrick says: "Uh, I buy Krabby Patties for $3 and I.."
Patrick says: "I sell them for $50."
Squidward says: "Ha and ha!"
Patrick says: "Why is he so mad, Squidward?"
Patrick says: "I was just following your advice!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It was your idea, huh?"
Cuts to SpongeBob bringing more patties out.
SpongeBob says: "Here's a whole new batch of Krabby Patty canvases."
Mr. Krabs says: "Great, SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That'll be fifty bucks!"
Nat says: "It's so inexpensive!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And here's your patty!"
Mr. Krabs says: "One more art patty, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Star!"
Nat says: "It's such an honor to meet you!"
Patrick says: "I can only imagine!"
Patrick says: "Apprentice!"
Patrick says: "Make another of my masterpieces, good man."
Squidward grabs the patty and starts to glue.
Patrick says: "If you work real hard, you may be an artist too someday!"
Squidward growls at Patrick. Patrick looks at the patty.
Patrick says: "Mm, probably not."
Patrick says: "Needs more glitter."
Squidward breaks down bawling, ending the episode.
