Frankie Billy says: "Excuse me, a patty for the lady please."
Squidward says: "Try reading the sign, Casanova."
Frankie tries to read the sign, but he can't.
Evelyn says: "You never learned to read, did you?"
Frankie Billy says: "No."
Evelyn says: "That's all right, neither did I!"
Frankie Billy says: "We were meant for each other!"
SpongeBob says: "You dropped your ook!"
Squidward says: "That's no "ook"."
Squidward says: "That's just a cruel reminder that I'm single, and likely to remain that way forever."
SpongeBob says: "Don't be sad, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "Turn that frown upside down!"
Squidward says: "I prefer my frowns in their traditional orientation."
SpongeBob says: "Just remember, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "You have never experienced true love."
SpongeBob says: "But that doesn't mean you will never find it!"
SpongeBob says: "You know the saying: There's a squid for every pot!"
Squidward says: "Great, let the tired cliches cascade forward."
Squidward says: "That'll make me feel better."
Squilvia walks inside and Squidward gasps.
Squidward says: "She's, wow!"
Squilvia says: "I absolutely adore the decor!"
Squilvia says: "Exquisitely minimalist!"
Squidward says: "She speaks art jargon!"
Squilvia says: "What culinary delights doth this menu hold?"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, she's got it all!"
Squidward says: "Class, style, grace,.."
Squidward says: "and looks only matched by yours truly!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, why don't you ask her out on one of those dates you keep talking about?"
Squidward says: "My next move exactly!"
Squidward says: "Observe the old Tentacles charm in all its glory!"
Squilvia says: "Is that Salmonese?"
SpongeBob says: "Boy, you are floundering up there!"
Squidward says: "I don't know what I'm doing!"
Squidward says: "I've never felt like this before."
SpongeBob says: "Squiddy, you've been bitten by the love bug!"
Squilvia says: "Hello!"
Squilvia says: "Hello?"
Squilvia says: "I'd like to order."
Squidward says: "She's talking to me."
Squidward says: "What do I do?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, I can help you attract your true love!"
Squidward says: "You!"
Squidward says: "?"
Squidward says: "You don't know the first thing about the fine art of romance!"
Squilvia says: "Well, since no one wants to take my order, I'll go elsewhere."
Squidward says: "She's leaving!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh no she's not!"
SpongeBob says: "Hang on, buddy!"
Squilvia says: "Finally, some service around here."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Idward Squay."
SpongeBob says: "'Emeber ray the eat day."
SpongeBob says: "I believe Squidward here is trying to ask you on a romantic date, ma'am."
SpongeBob says: "Right, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Shake the nice lady's hand and say "Hello."
Squilvia says: "Hello."
Squilvia says: "My name is Squilvia."
Squilvia says: "Uh..."
Squilvia says: "is he okay?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yes."
SpongeBob says: "He-he's just tired, you know, from all the hard work he's been doing around here."
SpongeBob says: "I so admire his work ethic."
SpongeBob says: "So, what do you think?"
SpongeBob says: "You want to date him?"
Squilvia says: "Uh..."
Squilvia says: "I don't know."
Squilvia says: "I'm not too sure..."
SpongeBob says: "Wait a minute!"
SpongeBob says: "Before you make any hasty decisions, allow me to tell you a few things about my friend, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Things I think you should know, like that Squidward is by far the single most intelligent person I know."
Squilvia says: "Intelligent?"
SpongeBob says: "That's right!"
SpongeBob says: "We are talking some serious credentials."
Squilvia says: "L."
Squilvia says: "A."
Squilvia says: "M."
Squilvia says: "E."
Squilvia says: "?"
Squilvia says: "What school is that?"
SpongeBob says: "The point is, he thinks you look like a ray of pure sunshine in that dress."
Squilvia says: "Really?"
Squilvia says: "Wow."
Squilvia says: "He really said that?"
SpongeBob says: "You betcha!"
SpongeBob says: "He's such a charmer."
Squidward says: "Don't forget artistic and musical."
SpongeBob says: "Not to mention that he's an incredible painter, a virtuoso musician, loves to cook and clean and also enjoys gardening quite a bit, too."
Squilvia says: "Oh, he sounds interesting!"
SpongeBob says: "But you know what is the most amazing thing about Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "It's his selflessness, his undying commitment to being a true friend."
SpongeBob says: "And I know anyone who is lucky enough to go on a romantical date with this guy would get to experience things on a whole 'nother and very special level."
SpongeBob says: "So, how does dinner at 8:00 sound, Squilvia?"
Squilvia says: "I think that sounds perfect."
Squilvia says: "I'll come by your place, okay?"
Squidward says: "Uh-huh."
Squilvia says: "See you at 8:00, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "You okay, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "You froze up there, buddy."
Squidward says: "What do you mean?"
SpongeBob says: "I mean, when was the last time you went out on a date?"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, you've gotta help me!"
Squidward says: "It's been so long!"
Squidward says: "What do I do?"
SpongeBob says: "You, my friend, are in desperate need of a practice date."
Squidward says: "That's it!"
Squidward says: "I'll go on..."
Squidward says: "a practice date?"
Squidward says: "I don't get it."
SpongeBob says: "Just meet me at my house at 5:00, Squidward."
Bubble transition to SpongeBob's house. Squidward rings the doorbell.
SpongeBob says: "Just one minute, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Sometime today would be nice."
SpongeBob says: "I'm ready!"
Squidward says: "Dear Neptune!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "Aren't you going to compliment my outfit?"
Squidward says: "Um..."
Squidward says: "You look..."
Squidward says: "stunning?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, you're so sweet!"
SpongeBob says: "Where are my flowers?"
Squidward says: "What!"
Squidward says: "Oh!"
Squidward says: "Um."
Squidward says: "Did you drop your lip balm!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't think I've dropped anything..."
SpongeBob says: "Ooh!"
SpongeBob says: "You shouldn't have."
Squidward says: "Oh, but I wanted to!"
SpongeBob says: "No, you really shouldn't have."
SpongeBob says: "It's just that I'm very allerg..."
SpongeBob says: "I'm very all..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "very allergic to tulips."
SpongeBob says: "Anyway, are you ready to go?"
Squidward says: "Go where?"
SpongeBob says: "To dinner, silly."
Squidward says: "Oh, right!"
Squidward says: "I'll get my car."
Squidward says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "A gentlemen always opens a door for a lady."
Squidward says: "Can I help you with that?"
SpongeBob says: "No, no, I've got it!"
Squidward says: "Would you get- There!"
SpongeBob says: "Ah, snug."
Squidward says: "Uh-huh."
Squidward says: "Can we go now?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes."
Squidward says: "Great."
SpongeBob says: "Right after I tinkle."
SpongeBob says: "Oh good thing I went, I don’t think I would’ve made it to the restaurant."
SpongeBob says: "Is something wrong Squidward?"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "Just hungry that’s all."
SpongeBob says: "Great, well I know a fabulous place!"
SpongeBob says: "Just head this way."
Squidward says: "Wonderful."
SpongeBob says: "Okay now at this stop sign turn right."
Squidward says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "Now at this light make a right."
Squidward says: "Gotcha."
SpongeBob says: "Now at this street here make a right."
SpongeBob says: "And at this intersection here make a right, and then park right near the orange building just up ahead."
SpongeBob says: "Ooh!"
SpongeBob says: "We're here!"
Squidward says: "You're a real piece of work, you know that?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh why, thank you, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Way to compliment the date, Squidward."
Bubble transition.
SpongeBob says: "Now, it's the chit-chat part of the date."
SpongeBob says: "Amuse her with an interesting conversation."
Squidward says: "Oh..."
Squidward says: "Um..."
Squidward says: "Chit-chat..."
Squidward says: "Can you believe this weather we're having?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, good effort, but you might want to start with something more personal."
SpongeBob says: "A woman may like to talk about her day, for example."
SpongeBob says: "She may want to talk about her promotion at work, or the wacky antics of her pet snail, or talk about how I was nearly late for our date because I couldn't decide what to wear, and then I didn't really have enough cash to give the lady at the nail salon."
Squidward says: "Urrgh!"
Patrick says: "Dinner is served."
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm famished!"
Patrick says: "Don't try to eat it."
Patrick says: "It's plastic."
SpongeBob says: "Now this is the perfect opportunity to work on your table etiquette."
Patrick says: "Here you go, ma'am!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, thank you, sir!"
Patrick says: "Hey, Squidward, who's the lovely lady sitting across from you?"
Patrick says: "I think she's giving me the cutesy eye!"
Squidward says: "Oh, no, you don't, Patrick!"
Squidward says: "You cannot just barge across like this!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob and I are in the middle of a practice date!"
Patrick says: "So, do you hang out here often?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, this is my home, silly."
Squidward says: "Excuse me, but how is this supposed to help me with my real date?"
SpongeBob says: "Such as..."
Squidward grabs SpongeBob's mouth.
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "Would you please just shut it and leave me alone?"
SpongeBob says: "Um, Squidward.."
Squidward says: "Don't "um, Squidward" me, you, you annoying, insignificant, waste of my time!"
SpongeBob says: "Um, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Don't interrupt me!"
Squidward says: "And don't call me, look at me, write me, or even think of me!"
Squidward says: "Because you and I, we are not friends!"
Squidward says: "And never will be."
SpongeBob says: "Does this mean there won't be a second date?"
Squidward walks and sees Squilvia.
Squidward says: "Um, you saw that, didn't you?"
Squilvia says: "Oh, only all of it."
Squidward says: "And you probably think I'm a mean-spirited brute, which, ironically, is the exact opposite of what you were expecting, right?"
Squilvia says: "Not exactly."
Squidward says: "Huh?"
Squilvia says: "I think a guy who doesn't suffer fools lightly is totally dreamy."
Squilvia says: "Let's go eat!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, I'm dreamy!"
Squilvia pulls Squidward away so they can go eat.
SpongeBob says: "Have fun, you two!"
SpongeBob says: "SquarePants, your work here is done."
Patrick says: "Not quite!"
Patrick says: "I was promised a movie, and some plastic popcorn."
