Note says: "Line in red is cut in Indonesia."
Squidward says: "Ho-ho, that would be great!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, aren't you two supposed to be camping?"
SpongeBob says: "We are camping."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, it's not camping if you're ten feet from your house."
SpongeBob says: "Aww, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you're outdoors."
SpongeBob says: "While all those soft city folk are safe in their beds reading books, we're out here, pitting ourselves against the formidable forces of nature."
SpongeBob says: "You wanna join us?"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "Have fun inside."
Squidward says: "What do you mean, "have fun inside"?"
SpongeBob says: "Just..."
SpongeBob says: "have fun inside."
SpongeBob says: "See you tomorrow."
Squidward says: "Oh."
Squidward says: "Bye."
Squidward says: "You little sneak!"
Squidward says: "I see what you're doing!"
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Squidward says: "Don't think I can't see what you're doing!"
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Squidward says: "You're saying I can't take it!"
SpongeBob says: "But all I..."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "Have fun inside."
SpongeBob says: "That was great, Squidward, but how do you get inside?"
Patrick says: "Yeah, it's all crushy-looking."
Squidward says: "It isn't put up yet, you idiots."
Squidward says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Customization!"
Patrick says: "Genius!"
Squidward says: "Bah!"
Squidward says: "Bah!"
Squidward says: "Bah!"
SpongeBob says: "He's tenderizing the ground!"
Patrick says: "Of course!"
Squidward is still struggling with the tent.
SpongeBob says: "Write that down!!"
SpongeBob says: "Write that down!!"
Squidward says: "Well, I've worked up an appetite as big as all outdoors."
Squidward says: "Time for a little grub."
Squidward says: "I suppose you two are gonna stew up some twigs and rocks, right?"
SpongeBob says: "Mmm-mm."
SpongeBob says: "just like the astronauts eat."
Patrick says: "Patrick to SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "Patrick to SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "Do you read me?"
Patrick says: "Over."
SpongeBob says: "SpongeBob to Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I read you."
SpongeBob says: "Over."
Patrick says: "Over."
Patrick says: "Yummy!"
Patrick says: "Patrick to SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "The deliciousness has landed!"
Squidward says: "Well, you two astronauts can eat marshmallows."
Squidward says: "I'm gonna have a can of Swedish Barnacle Balls,  just as soon as I can get my can opener."
SpongeBob says: "But Squidward, didn't you take a can opener when you hiked out here?"
Squidward says: "Why would I bother?"
Squidward says: "We're ten feet from my house."
SpongeBob says: "But this is the wilderness!"
SpongeBob says: "It just doesn't seem to fit the camping spirit."
Patrick says: "Pretty weenie."
Squidward says: "Alright."
Squidward says: "Alright."
Squidward says: "Gimme a marshmallow."
Squidward begins toasting his marshmallow lightly. Patrick, sitting across from him, sets his on fire and tries to blow on it to cool it down, but the marshmallow flies off and hits Squidward in the face. Patrick gets another marshmallow and repeats the same thing twice. After two marshmallows to the face, Squidward ducks, but the third marshmallow has a boomerang effect and hits Squidward in the back of the head.
Squidward says: "Okay."
Squidward says: "Besides spitting molten food stuffs at me, what else do you do for fun?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, after a long day of camping, it's nice to unwind with a nice, relaxing campfire song."
SpongeBob says: "I call this one "The Campfire Song Song"."
SpongeBob says: "♪Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song."
SpongeBob says: "Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song."
SpongeBob says: "And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong."
SpongeBob says: "But it'll help if you just sing along..."
Patrick says: "♪Bum!"
Patrick says: "Bum!"
Patrick says: "Bum!"
Both says: "♪C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!"
Both says: "C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!"
SpongeBob says: "♪And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong!"
SpongeBob says: "But it'll help if you just sing along..."
Patrick says: "♪Sing another song..."
SpongeBob says: "♪C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!"
SpongeBob says: "♪ Patrick!"
Patrick says: "♪SONG!"
Patrick says: "C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E..."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "♪OH YEAH!!!"
SpongeBob says: "♪ Ahh, now, wasn't that relaxing?"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "This is relaxing."
SpongeBob says: "Oh no!"
SpongeBob says: "I'll save you, Squidward!!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, are you all right?"
SpongeBob says: "That's it, chew, chew, and swallow."
SpongeBob says: "There, better?"
Squidward says: "Better?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "I was just fine until you lodged that ballistic junk food into my windpipe!"
SpongeBob says: "But I had to!"
SpongeBob says: "It's too dangerous to play the clarinet badly out here in the wilderness!"
SpongeBob says: "It might attract..."
SpongeBob says: "a sea bear."
Squidward says: "don't exist?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "What are you saying?"
Squidward says: "There's no such thing!"
Squidward says: "They're just a myth!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh no, Squidward, sea bears are all too real!"
SpongeBob says: "It says so in the Bikini Bottom Inquirer!"
Squidward says: ""I Married a Sea Bear"?"
Patrick says: "Yeah, and Fake Science Monthly!"
Squidward says: ""Sea Bears and Fairy Tales Are Real"?"
Squidward says: "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!"
Patrick says: "Well, maybe it is stupid, but it's also dumb!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick's right, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Sea bears are no laughing matter."
SpongeBob says: "Why, once I met this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy's cousin..."
Squidward says: "You're right!"
Squidward says: "I should be more careful."
Squidward says: "In fact, why don't you tell me all of the things I shouldn't do if I want to keep the sea bears away?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, that's easy."
SpongeBob says: "First off, don't play the clarinet."
Squidward says: "Okay."
Squidward says: "Then what?"
SpongeBob says: "Never wave your flashlight back and forth really fast."
Patrick says: "Flashlights are their natural prey."
Squidward says: "You're kidding."
SpongeBob says: "Don't stomp around."
SpongeBob says: "They take that as a challenge."
Patrick says: "Yeah."
Squidward says: "Go on."
SpongeBob says: "Don't ever eat cheese."
Squidward says: "Sliced or cubed?"
SpongeBob says: "Cubed; sliced is fine."
Squidward says: "Yeah, yeah, and?"
SpongeBob says: "Never wear a sombrero..."
Patrick says: "..."
Patrick says: "in a goofy fashion!"
SpongeBob says: "Or clown shoes."
Patrick says: "Or a hoop skirt."
SpongeBob says: "And never..."
Patrick says: "Ever..."
SpongeBob says: "Ever..."
Patrick says: "Duh!"
Both says: "Screech like a chimpanzee!"
Squidward says: "Wow!"
Squidward says: "That's amazing how many things can set a sea bear off!"
Both says: "They're horrible!"
Squidward says: "And..."
Squidward says: "and suddenly I have the sense we're all in danger!"
Both says: "Why?"
Squidward says: "I don't know..."
Squidward says: "Just a feeling!!"
SpongeBob says: "No."
Squidward says: "Yes."
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Squidward begins making chimp noises.
Both says: "Squidward, please don't!"
Squidward continues hooting, stomping, and waving flashlight around.
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, what are we gonna do?"
Patrick says: "A sea bear's sure to come and eat us!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I'll draw us an anti-sea-bear circle in the dirt."
Patrick says: "Good thinking!"
Patrick says: "All the experts say it's the only defense against a sea bear attack."
Squidward says: "Ha!"
Squidward says: "Ha!"
Squidward says: "Ha!"
Squidward says: "You guys are so gullible!"
Squidward says: "See?"
Squidward says: "I did everything that attracts a sea bear, and nothing happened!"
Squidward says: "If sea bears really exist, why didn't one show up?"
SpongeBob says: "Maybe it's because you're not wearing your sombrero in a goofy fashion."
Squidward says: "Oh, pfft, sorry!"
Squidward says: "How silly of me!"
Squidward says: "You mean like this?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Like that."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, are you okay?"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Quick!"
SpongeBob says: "Jump inside our anti-sea-bear circle before he comes back."
Patrick says: "Yeah."
Patrick says: "Sea bears often attack more than once."
Squidward says: "Are you crazy?"
Squidward says: "A dirt circle won't stop that monster."
Squidward says: "I'm running for my life!"
Both says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't run!"
SpongeBob says: "Sea bears hate that!"
Squidward says: "Thanks for the tip."
Squidward says: "I guess I'll just limp home, then."
Both says: "Nooooooo!"
SpongeBob says: "They hate limping more than running!"
Squidward says: "Well, I guess I'll just have..."
SpongeBob says: "I should have warned you about crawling."
Squidward says: "What'd I do that time?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know!"
SpongeBob says: "I guess he just doesn't like you."
Patrick says: "Pretend to be somebody else!!!"
SpongeBob says: "Here, draw a circle."
Squidward says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "That was an oval!"
SpongeBob says: "It has to be a circle!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, I'm glad it was just a sea bear."
SpongeBob says: "This circle would never hold back a sea rhinoceros."
Squidward says: "What attracts them?"
Patrick says: "The sound of a sea bear attack."
SpongeBob says: "Heh, good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea-rhinoceros undergarments, right, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Uh huh."
