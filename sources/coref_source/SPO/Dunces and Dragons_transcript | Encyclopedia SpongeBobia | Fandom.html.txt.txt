Patrick says: "Right behind ya, SpongeBob!"
Speaker says: "Welcome to Medieval Moments."
Speaker says: "You're just 20 wizard's paces away from swords, sorcery and bad hygiene."
Henchman says: "Right this way, please."
SpongeBob says: "Excuse me, my good man, I believe thou meant to say "Righteth this wayeth."
Henchman says: "Some day, but not today."
Inside castle.
SpongeBob says: "How's that mutton, Patrick?"
Medieval Queen says: "Morrie, you're supposed to announce the jousting tournament!"
Medieval King says: "Good evening, fair patrons of Medieval Moments."
Medieval King says: "By royal decree, we ask that two audience members come forth and participate in the, uhh, royal joust."
Medieval King says: "Oh, alright."
Medieval King says: "It appears that the pink starfish and the yellow sponge are our lucky contestants tonight."
Medieval King says: "Hooray."
SpongeBob says: "Isn't this exciting, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "To think, we'll be watching the joust this close up!"
Royal Henchman says: "You won't be watching the joust, you're in the joust."
SpongeBob says: "Pat, do you know how to ride a seahorse?"
Patrick says: "Nuh-uh."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Seahorse, sir, you're gentle on beginners, aren't you?"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, help!"
Crowd says: "Take his head off!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't suppose now would be a good time to ask for a bathroom break!"
SpongeBob says: "Look, some employees from the restaurant came to help us!"
Horseman says: "Arrest these traitors for committing the act of witchcraft by falling from the sky!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoa, they really go that extra mile for authenticity."
SpongeBob says: "Salutations fellow knights."
Horseman says: "Silence, heathen!"
SpongeBob says: "Ah!"
SpongeBob says: "I get the point."
Dungeon Master says: "Good night, ladies!"
Dungeon Master says: "You'll have many more in here."
SpongeBob says: "Gee, Pat, these props sure are convincing."
Squidly says: "Oh, blast this confounded instrument!"
Squidly says: "If I never play with ease, may my own great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandson be cursed tenfold!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, what are you doing here?"
Squidly says: "Dost thou talketh to me?"
Squidly says: "Scoff not, young squire."
Squidly says: "Thou hast mistaken me for another."
Squidly says: "I am Squidly, the king's royal fool."
Squidly says: "Or at least I was until I royally messed up."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, what'd you do?"
Squidly says: "I'll show you."
Squidly says: "♪I was the king's favorite fool."
Squidly says: "I made merry mirth and laughter."
Squidly says: "Then I told one bad joke and the king had a stroke, now I hang from ye olde rafter."
Patrick says: "What does a guy have to do get some mutton around here?"
Patrick says: "I'm starving!"
Squidly says: "Don't hold thy breath!"
Squidly says: "We'll be lucky if we get fed again by the 12th century!"
SpongeBob says: "They sure do take their role-playing seriously around here."
Patrick says: "What's that?"
Squidly says: "♪The evil wizard's dragon is here."
Squidly says: "See the townsfolk scream with fear."
Squidly says: "See the townsfolk try to run."
Squidly says: "I can tell this won't be fun."
Squidly says: "The dragon will torch everything."
Squidly says: "Everything in the valley."
Squidly says: "Hospitals, schools, retirement homes, and even ye olde bowling alley."
Citizen says: "Not the bowling alley!"
SpongeBob says: "Knights, jesters, dragons, medieval bowling alleys, 12th century?"
SpongeBob says: "Don't you see, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "We really are in medieval times!"
Patrick says: "Oh no, I think I left the water running at home!"
Dungeon Master says: "The king wants a word with you two."
Patrick says: "Yay!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait, we don't leave without Squidly."
Dungeon Master says: "Why should I take him?"
SpongeBob says: "Because, umm, Squidly has thought of some brilliant songs for the king and he just has to hear them."
SpongeBob says: "Isn't that right, Squidly?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidly, uhh, maybe you should wait for the king to hear that."
Squidly says: "Suit thineselves."
Squidly says: "Thou dost not knoweth what thou art missing."
King says: "Woe is me."
King says: "Woe is me."
King says: "Woe is me."
King says: "What to do?"
King says: "What to do?"
Pearl says: "Father, what art thou going on about now?"
King says: "Oh, just the same ol' thing, dear daughter."
King says: "It's that wretched wizard Planktonamor!"
King says: "His insidious dragon's destroyed half the kingdom."
King says: "Soon, there'll be no citizens to tax."
King says: "Not one of me best knights have been able to defeat him."
Pearl says: "Father, remember your blood pressure."
Pearl says: "You wouldn't want another leech treatment, would you?"
Leech says: "Meow."
Henchman says: "Your highness, the dungeon master has brought the prisoners you asked for."
King says: "Well don't just stand there, send 'em in!"
Henchman says: "Sure thing, your highnessssssssss."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
King says: "How dare you bark at me in that tone, knave!"
King says: "I am the feared ruler of this kingdom and will be addressed as such."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry."
King says: "And why have you brought this fool back into me throne room?"
Squidly says: "If your majesty may be so kind, I think I have a song that will answer all your questions."
King says: "Ohh, alright, alright!"
King says: "But this is your last chance, fool."
Squidly says: "Oh, thank you sir."
Squidly says: "Thank you."
Squidly says: "You won't be disappointed."
Squidly says: "♪Oh hear me king for I must sing, how you are the greatest at everything."
Squidly says: "Like letting a dragon burn down our city, a horrible sight that wasn't pretty."
Squidly says: "'Twas all your fault and 'tis a pity, you are bad, you are to blame, now hang your kingly head in shame."
Squidly says: "La la la la la la la la la la la!"
Squidly says: "♪The king is bad, the king's to blame, he hangs his kingly head in shame."
SpongeBob says: "♪The king is bad, the king's to blame, he hangs his kingly head in shame."
Patrick says: "♪The king is bad, the king's to blame, he hangs his kingly head in shame."
Squidly says: "La la la la la la la la la la la!"
SpongeBob says: "La la la la la la la la la la la!"
Patrick says: "La la la la la la la la la la la!"
King says: "Guards!"
King says: "Send these slanderers to the guillotine!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait, you don't understand!"
SpongeBob says: "We're not from here!"
King says: "That's because you're witches who were sent by Planktonamor to destroy me!"
SpongeBob says: "No, we're time travelers!"
SpongeBob says: "Help me out here, Patrick."
Patrick says: "I'm not sure that there's anything I can add at this point."
King says: "Ok, I'm through playing around."
King says: "Guards!"
Pearl says: "Father, you must spare them."
Pearl says: "Hast thou forgotten about the prophecy?"
King says: "What prophecy?"
Pearl says: "The one right above your head!"
King says: "How long has that been there?"
Pearl says: "The story tells of two brave knights who fall from the sky, and are sent by the king to rid the lamenting town of the evil dragon controlled by the one-eyed wizard."
Pearl says: "Father, don't you get it?"
Pearl says: "It's them!"
Pearl says: "These strangers have come to rescue us, like in the prophecy."
King says: "How dare you defile my house, demon!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I guess this is it, Patrick."
Patrick says: "I guess so."
Patrick says: "I'm gonna miss you, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "I'll miss you, too, buddy!"
Pearl says: "Daddy, help!"
King says: "Pearl!"
King says: "Most noble and valiant warriors."
Patrick says: "I guess this is what you call the royal treatment."
King says: "May Neptune grant you safety on your perilous journey to the evil wizard's castle to which no one has escaped alive!"
SpongeBob says: "We're going on a perilous journey?"
King says: "Well, of course, you're the chosen ones."
King says: "Huh, what's this?"
King says: "A lost piece of the prophecy?"
King says: "Hmmm..."
SpongeBob says: "Lemme guess, more praise for our heroic stature?"
King says: "Actually, it says I'm supposed to kick you out of here."
SpongeBob says: "Say no more, Your Majesty."
SpongeBob says: "Us manly knights are so manly, we kick ourselves out of places."
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Look out, trouble!"
Squidly says: "Well, so much for their company."
King says: "On second thought, you better go with 'em."
King says: "They could use the entertainment."
Squidly says: "Have it your way."
King says: "Good luck, strange ones!"
SpongeBob says: "I know we're a prophecy and all, but I don't think we can stop the dragon with our bare hands."
Patrick says: "Yeah, we need some gloves."
Squidly says: "Perhaps yonder blacksmith can provide some arms for your battle."
SpongeBob says: "At last, an honest man of the soil."
SpongeBob says: "Observe, as a I effortlessly commingle with this brutish native."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "Bottom."
Blacksmith says: "I told you people before, I'll have the rent when I have it!"
SpongeBob says: "We just wanted to buy some armor."
Blacksmith says: "Well, why didn't you just say that?"
Blacksmith says: "Hmmm, I've got just the thing for you."
Patrick says: "Wow, SpongeBob, you look incredible!"
Blacksmith says: "And now for the piece de resistance."
Blacksmith says: "Your sword, brave knight."
Blacksmith says: "Hand-forged from anodized dragon's skin."
Blacksmith says: "It is truly a weapon worthy of a knight of your stature."
SpongeBob says: "That's perfect!"
Squidly says: "We doth have a long journey ahead of us."
SpongeBob says: "It's a good thing I packed us a lunch of delicious Krabby Patties."
Patrick says: "Ooh!"
SpongeBob puts the patties in the brown bag and back in his pocket. Planktonamor sees the three heroes in the crystal ball.
Lord Planktonamor says: "Oh, that be-eth rich."
Lord Planktonamor says: "'Twould almost insult me were it not so funny."
Karen the Crystal Ball says: "Planktonamor, thou art cocky and overly confident with thyself."
Lord Planktonamor says: "Trusteth in me, Karen."
Lord Planktonamor says: "I doth knowest what I am doing."
Lord Planktonamor says: "Come hither, boy!"
Dark Knight says: "Halt!"
Dark Knight says: "Who goes there?"
Squidly says: "Doth my eyes betray me?"
Squidly says: "'Tis the nefarious Dark Knight!"
Squidly says: "♪Oh, dark knight, spare us please, don't cut off our heads or boil our knees."
Squidly says: "Pray take these two and let me go free and I will give to thee some..."
Squidly says: "cheese!"
SpongeBob says: "Dark Knight?!"
Patrick says: "Dark Knight?!"

SpongeBob says: "I am bad!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoo!"
Dark Knight says: "Doth thou tryeth to insult me?"
Dark Knight says: "Thou willst drink from the fountain of shame!"
SpongeBob says: "Pssh, did you hear that, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "I told you she zings like a squirrel."
Dark Knight says: "Wouldst thou like a little rub down?"
Dark Knight says: "You have bested me, yellow knight..."
Dark Knight says: "Strike quick and true, noble sponge..."
SpongeBob says: "I don't understand a word you just said!"
Dark Knight says: "Thou hath spared me, kind and noble sponge."
Dark Knight says: "And to thee, I owe a debt of gratitude, for I will follow you on your quest to defeat Planktonamor and learn a trifle of that karate."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, karate!"
Squidly says: "Oweth."
Henchman says: "Your Majesty!"
Henchman says: "Your Majesty!"
Henchman says: "A scroll hath arrived for thee!"
King Krabs says: "Thou must hand over thy village and thy throne or thy daughter shall be dipped into a cauldron of lava?!"
King Krabs says: "!"
King Krabs says: "Pearl!"
Squidly says: "That be the shriek of the fair Princess!"
Squidly says: "♪Hark, the Princess, she screams from the tower, by the sound of her shrieks this is her final hour."
Dark Knight says: "Then time be of the essence."
Dark Knight says: "Doth we all remember thy plan?"
Patrick says: "No, uhh, I mean yes!"
Patrick says: "Yes!"
Patrick says: "That's what I said, heh."
Patrick says: "Yes."
Dark Knight says: "Then let us forge on."
Dark Knight says: "Make way, heathens!"
Dark Knight says: "Dark Knight coming through."
Guard says: "State thy business, Dark Knight."
Dark Knight says: "These village idiots are conspirators against Master Planktonamor and I needeth know which form of torture thy master wishes upon these wretched fools!"
Dark Knight says: "Do I have their limbs tied to horses and swiftly yanked apart?"
Dark Knight says: "Rip!"
Dark Knight says: "Or pluck each individual eyelash one by one, taking away their every single last eyelash wish!"
Guard says: "Very well, Dark Knight."
Guard says: "Entrance be granted."
Dark Knight says: "Wow, goodsome thinking, Sir SpongeBob."
Dark Knight says: "Posing as a frightened wee babe in ye ol' diapers did make it most believable."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, you think we fooled them?"
SpongeBob says: "Princess Pearl!"
SpongeBob says: "I must fulfill the prophecy while you untie Patrick and the royal doofus."
Squidly says: "That be royal fool."
SpongeBob says: "We're a-comin'!"

SpongeBob says: "Prepare to be vanquished!"
Lord Planktonamor says: "Bring it oneth, knave."
Pearl says: "I be-eth okay."
Squidly says: "Perhaps a soothing limerick will calm thee."
Squidly says: "♪There once was a dragon so handsome and smart, he let me go free for he had a big heart."
Squidly says: "♪  Everyone be-eth a critic."
Dark Knight says: "Hi-ya!"
