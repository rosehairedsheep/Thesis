Opens in on a bunch of jellyfish and one flying out of the field towards Conch Street.
Narrator says: "Ah, ze early morning in Bikini Bottom, when the jellyfish are buzzing about and making their jellyfish jelly."
Squidward says: "Hm."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward, we're jellyfishing."
Squidward says: "Of course you are."
Squidward says: "Bye now."
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "We made a net especially for you!"
SpongeBob says: "Do you want to come with us?"
Squidward says: "Really?"
Squidward says: "Jellyfishing with you guys?"
Squidward says: "Oh, that would be the best day ever in my book!"
Squidward says: "I would love to go jellyfishing!"
Squidward says: "I can't think of anything I'd like to do more on my day off than go jellyfishing with my two best friends: SpongeBob and..."
Squidward says: "uh..."
Patrick says: "Patrick."
Squidward says: "Right."
Squidward says: "But I can't."
Squidward says: "Bye bye."
SpongeBob says: "Next time?"
Squidward says: "Oh sure, right!"
Squidward says: "Whatever."
Squidward says: "Like that'll ever happen."
SpongeBob says: "You know, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "It always seems like Squidward never has time for fun."
Patrick says: "Maybe he doesn't like us."
SpongeBob says: "No, are you kidding?"
SpongeBob says: "We're his best friends."
Squidward says: "Jellyfishing."
Squidward says: "Ow..."
Cut to SpongeBob sitting at his house. He looks out the window. But, no one is there. He sits down again. He notices a photo of him and an unhappy Squidward that reads, "Friends." He puts it down and looks out the window again. Squidward, who's in a wheelchair and all bandaged up rolls down the path.
SpongeBob says: "Squid's back!"
Patrick says: "Yello?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick, Squid's home!"
SpongeBob says: "And we're gonna make sure he's greeted by his two best friends!"
Patrick says: "Oh, great!"
Patrick says: "Who are they?"
SpongeBob says: "Us!"
SpongeBob says: "Welcome home, Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Merry Christmas!"
SpongeBob says: "We're gonna make this your best day ever!"
Patrick says: "How about some soup on your best day ever?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't think soup is the best thing for him on his best day ever."
Patrick says: "Music isn't best either!"
SpongeBob says: "But what is best is what we saved for last."
SpongeBob says: "The one sure-fire thing to make your best day ever the best day ever!"
SpongeBob says: "Jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing!"
Patrick says: "Jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing!"
SpongeBob says: "This is Jellyfish Fields, where wild jellyfish roam just waiting to be captured."
SpongeBob says: "No, no, Squid!"
SpongeBob says: "Over here!"
SpongeBob says: "I know you're eager, but you don't even have your net."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, fix him up while I find him a good specimen."
Patrick says: "Firmly grasp it in your hand."
SpongeBob says: "There's one in position."
SpongeBob says: "Ready..."
SpongeBob says: "set..."
SpongeBob says: "go!"
Patrick says: "I think we gotta show him how it's done."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, look!"
SpongeBob says: "Squid's doing it!"
Patrick says: "This guy's good."
SpongeBob says: "He's a natural!"
SpongeBob and Patrick start simultaneously cheering Squidward on as he tries to get away from the Queen Jellyfish.
Patrick says: "Yeah, you got it, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, you're doing great!"
SpongeBob says: "Go, Squid, go!"
Patrick says: "Yeah, you're doing it, Squid!"
Patrick says: "See what you've been missing?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, you got, Squid!"
Patrick says: "You got what you wanted, Squidward!"
Patrick says: "You can go that distance!"
Patrick says: "Use that net!"
SpongeBob says: "Be the net!"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
Patrick says: "You're feeling it, Squid!"
Patrick says: "That's it, all the way!"
Patrick says: "The last 6 miles, make that, Squid!"
Patrick says: "Go, go, go!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, go by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger!"
SpongeBob says: "Better, better, better!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "You've got it now!"
Patrick says: "It's in the bag!"
SpongeBob says: "This is really your best day ever, isn't it?"
The Queen Jellyfish gives Squidward an extremely powerful sting. SpongeBob and Patrick stop cheering.
Both says: "Oooh..."
Cut to the next day where SpongeBob and Patrick walking in front of Squidward's place covered in bandages.
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Well..."
SpongeBob says: "pretty well, don't you think?"
Patrick says: "I had fun."
SpongeBob says: "Me too."
Patrick says: "Here comes Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, great."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "best day ever?"
Patrick says: "There's always tomorrow!"
SpongeBob says: "Um, we're really sorry about what happened yesterday, Squidward."
Patrick says: "You know, from yesterday!"
SpongeBob says: "You're not still mad, are you?"
Patrick says: "Yup, he's still mad."
Squidward says: "Ow."
