Episode starts at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is washing the windows while singing.
SpongeBob says: "♪Ooooooooo-oooooooohhh-woh-woooh, how much chum could a sea slug chug if a sea slug could chug..."
SpongeBob says: "♪  Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, you gotta get out here!"
SpongeBob says: "It's a code blue situation!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Please deposit 25 cents to continue this call."
SpongeBob says: "Sure thing, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "K."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, you gotta get out here!"
SpongeBob says: "It's a code blue situation!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Code blue?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's the matter, boy?"
SpongeBob says: "I think Plankton wants to destroy our way of life!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Man alive!"
Mr. Krabs says: "He's taking us down!"
Plankton says: "for the surprise of your life!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Brace yourself!"
Plankton says: "Greetings, citizens of Bikini Bottom!"
Plankton says: "Behold my imperial Chum Coliseum!"
Plankton says: "Come on!"
Plankton says: "Come all!"
Plankton says: "Remember, kids love gladiators."
Debbie says: "Wow!"
Debbie says: "Real-life conflict, for free?"
Nathiel says: "Let the horror show begin!"
Plankton says: "Oh, Karen, even though you're just a frigid machine, your circuits must be welling up with emotion at my latest achievement."
Karen says: "Oh, yes, my resistors are simply gushing from their copper foil traces."
Plankton says: "This will prove to be my greatest evil scheme ever!"
Karen says: "That's what you said when you tried to boil Krabs in a giant bisque."
Plankton says: "I can still feel the burns..."
Plankton says: "which is why I removed all molten liquid from this maneuver."
Plankton says: "And it's why this time, I will be the one with all the customers."
Plankton says: "And Krabs will be the pathetic one, in an empty restaurant, stuck with a computer for a wife!"
Plankton says: "Uh, sorry, honey."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, looks like Plankton finally has some customers!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I agree, it's very suspicious."
Mr. Krabs says: "And he may have lured a few of our fair-weather customers in with some cheap entertainment, but our loyal customers know quality when they taste it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "So let's get in there and serve 'em up a burger they tell their grand-guppies about!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Where's all me loyal customers?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Squidward says: "They've all taken their grand-guppies to see the guts and gore across the street."
Mr. Krabs says: "That lower life form can slender my name, and desecrate me mother's grave..."
Mama Krabs says: "I'm right here!"
Mr. Krabs says: "..."
Mr. Krabs says: "but when he steals me customers, then I push back!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Gentlemen, to the coliseum!"
Plankton says: "Welcome, one and all, to the first biannual big arena of annihilation!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoo!"
Plankton says: "Brought to you by yours truly."
Plankton says: "So without further ado, let the mauling begin!"
Scooter says: "All right!"
SpongeBob says: "Yay!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Isn't this a boat load of fun, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "I can't wait to see the poor sucker who has to go up against that beast!"
Squidward says: "You call this fun?"
Squidward says: "This is just cheap, uncultured lay sport."
Plankton says: "Now, release the opponent!"
SpongeBob says: "Yes!"
SpongeBob says: "Go!"
Squidward says: "This is fabulous!"
Plankton says: "Enough dilly-dallying."
Plankton says: "Send out the blood sausages!"
Patrick says: "All right!"
Plankton says: "That pink dimwit doesn't stand a chance with those sausages around his throat!"
Plankton says: "As soon as the smell of sausage hits that ravenous lionfish's nostrils, he'll be all over Patrick like mold on a shower curtain!"
Sally says: "Rip his sausages off!"
Patrick says: "Ohh."
Patrick says: "Nice kitty."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
Patrick says: "What?"
Patrick says: "Oh!"
Patrick says: "Oh, it's you!"
Patrick says: "Hey, how's it going, buddy?"
SpongeBob says: "No time for chitchat, get in!"
SpongeBob says: "Hurry up, Nelly!"
Nat says: "Boo!"
Mama Krabs says: "Boring!"
Mama Krabs says: "I want to see some body parts!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Mom!"
Plankton says: "This is ridiculous!"
Plankton says: "I order a simple brutal mauling for my denizens, and I get a circus act!"
Plankton says: "Time for phase 2!"
Plankton says: "Chum on a stick!"
Plankton says: "Get your fresh chum right here!"
Plankton says: "Some chum for you, miss?"
Sadie says: "Well, all this waiting around for someone to get mauled is making me a bit hungry."
Plankton says: "Here, take this one."
Plankton says: "It's fresh and warm, like my hospitality."
Sadie says: "Why, thank you."
Plankton says: "Just ten dollars, please."
Sadie says: "Ten dollars?!"
Sadie says: "!"
Sadie says: "Why would I pay ten dollars, when I can go across the street and get a Krabby Patty for one dollar?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Exactly!"
Plankton says: "You don't get this kind of entertainment with a Krabby Patty, do you?"
Sadie says: "No, I suppose not."
Plankton says: "Ten dollars, or the fight's off!"
Sadie says: "Ah, fine!"
Sadie says: "Whatever."
Plankton says: "Here you are."
Plankton says: "I'm sure I've made a satisfied customer of you already."
Sadie takes it annoyed, eats it, and spits it out immediately.
Sadie says: "That was appalling!"
Sadie says: "What was in that?!"
Sadie says: "!"
Plankton says: "Oh, just the usual ingredients."
Plankton says: "Some jellyfish squeezings, whale blubber, sea horse snout, and a sprinkle of anchor rust."
Plankton says: "Now, I've been waiting for 20 years to have the amount of customers Krabs sees every day!"
Plankton says: "And I won't let that be ruined because the show's "boring," or the food's "inedible."
Plankton says: "" So sit down, enjoy the show, and buy some chum!"
SpongeBob says: "What do we do now, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Don't worry, I'm already doing it."
SpongeBob says: "NO!"
Plankton says: "Chum on a stick!"
Plankton says: "Get your chum!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You know, I'm not one to give out comments lightly."
Mr. Krabs says: "I've gotta hand it to you, boy,  if you didn't throw those sausages into the audience, we would have been dead meat!"
SpongeBob says: "My pleasure, Captain!"
Patrick says: "Yeah, thanks, buddy!"
Patrick says: "You really saved my behind!"
Patrick says: "No joke!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I think that it's safe to say that no matter how diabolical Plankton's plans may be, he'll never have the loyalty of me good customers."
Wobbles says: "One Krabby Patty, please."
Mr. Krabs says: "But of course, my good customer."
Mr. Krabs says: "That'll be ten dollars."
Wobbles says: "Ten dollars?"
Wobbles says: "What happened to one dollar?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ahem, perhaps you'd like to speak to our financial expert."
Wobbles says: "Stupid inflation."
Mr. Krabs says: "Thanks for your business."
