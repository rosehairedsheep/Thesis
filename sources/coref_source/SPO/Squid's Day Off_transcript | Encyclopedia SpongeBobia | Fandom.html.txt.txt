Narrator says: "Ah, beautiful springtime."
Narrator says: "A time for fun and frolic for most..."
Squidward says: "Oh, what a beautiful day."
Squidward says: "And here I am trapped in a prison of high cholesterol."
SpongeBob says: "I was just testing it."
Squidward says: "I will ring the bell when there's an order."
Squidward says: "But..."
SpongeBob says: "One Krabby Patty coming up!"
Squidward says: "No!"
The register drawer shoots open, knocking Squidward out of the way. A bunch of coins fall onto the floor. The scene changes to show Mr. Krabsâ€™ office where Mr. Krabs is writing something on a sheet of paper and he stops to hear the money dropping.
Mr. Krabs says: "That sounds like me money dropping."
Mr. Krabs says: "No, no, no, don't cry, little ones."
SpongeBob says: "What's wrong, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Me dime!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What the?"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's stuck!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You gotta help me, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "You've gotta let go of the dime."
Mr. Krabs says: "I can think of ten good reasons to never let go of a dime, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "There's got to be another way!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Grab me captain's quarters and heave!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Me arms!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh no, not again!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm putting you in charge of things around here while I'm gone."
Squidward says: "Okay, SpongeBob, let's get down to business."
Squidward says: "My first official act as new manager is to give you a promotion."
SpongeBob's pupils form into stars.
SpongeBob says: "Ahh!"
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
Squidward says: "You get to run the cash register."
SpongeBob says: "The cash register..."
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, who's gonna work the grill?"
Squidward says: "You are-- It's part of the promotion I mentioned earlier."
Squidward says: "You'll be wearing two hats now."
Squidward says: "You're gonna take the orders and then you're gonna make them!"
SpongeBob says: "Ah..."
SpongeBob says: "This is the best day of my life."
Squidward says: "Me, too."
SpongeBob says: "But wait, if I'm running the register and the grill, what are you gonna do?"
Squidward says: "I've got some very important boss-like errands to run."
Squidward says: "See ya later."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Squidward says: "What is it?"
SpongeBob says: "You forgot to teach me how to use..."
SpongeBob says: "the cash register."
Squidward says: "You push the button and put the money inside."
Squidward says: "Okay, you're on your own."
SpongeBob says: "I can't believe this is really happening."
SpongeBob says: "Today, I start living!"
The scene changes to show Squidward walking outside.
Squidward says: "Well, Squidward, you've really outdone yourself this time."
Squidward says: "A beautiful day of relaxing and pampering..."
Squidward says: "With pay."
Squidward says: "Hmm..."
Squidward says: "I guess I do kinda feel bad for poor little SpongeBob, all by his lonesome..."
Squidward says: "Oh, oh, it'll pass."
Squidward says: "He's probably just standing at the register with that stupid grin on his face."
Thought Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob!"
Thought SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick!"
Thought Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob, could you give me change for a quarter?"
Thought SpongeBob says: "No problem!"
Thought SpongeBob says: "Here ya go!"
Thought Patrick says: "Thanks."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "All done with those errands?"
Squidward says: "No, I am not."
Squidward says: "I just remembered I needed change for this dollar."
SpongeBob says: "Do you want four quarters?"
SpongeBob says: "Or, if you give me a five dollar bill, your options are..."
Squidward says: "Alright, goodbye."
Squidward says: "I'm the boss, I deserve this."
Squidward says: "Ah..."
Thought SpongeBob says: "Ehh..."
Thought SpongeBob says: "Gettin' kinda bored."
Squidward says: "Oh, what am I doing?"
SpongeBob says: "May I help you, sir?"
Squidward says: "It's me, you dunce!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hi, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "How are those errands going?"
Squidward says: "What's that supposed to mean?"
Squidward says: "I'm very busy."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I'm sure you are."
Squidward says: "I don't like your tone."
SpongeBob says: "How's that?"
Squidward says: "Just do your jobs!"
SpongeBob says: "Aye-aye, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Tentacles."
Squidward says: "Must..."
Squidward says: "re..."
Mirror SpongeBob says: "I will destroy the Krusty Krab!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Have you finished..."
SpongeBob says: "?"
Squidward says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "Have you finished those errands?"
SpongeBob says: "Have you finished those errands?"
SpongeBob says: "Have you finished those errands?"
SpongeBob says: "Have you finished those errands?"
Squidward says: "No, I am not finished with those errands and I never will be, so quit checking up on me!"
Squidward says: "Forcing me to come back here every time you mess up!"
SpongeBob says: "But I haven't..."
SpongeBob says: "Gosh, Squidward sure is a hard worker."
SpongeBob says: "He makes me proud to wear  these hats."
The scene changes to show Squidward locking his door using his key, putting padlocks on it, bolting it down with wood and nails, putting police tape up, and using a blowtorch to weld the door shut so he can't get out.
Squidward says: "There!"
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "toilet."
Squidward says: "You're losin' it, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Calm down."
Squidward says: "If I let this get to me again, I'll just end up running down to the Krusty Krab, bursting through the front door, up to that yellow headache SpongeBob, and he'll say..."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Aha!"
Sadie says: "Hey, put some clothes on!"
Squidward says: "The truth will be revealed!"
Purple Doctorfish says: "Okay, Mr."
Purple Doctorfish says: "Krabs."
Purple Doctorfish says: "Get plenty of rest and if things don't seem right, come back."
Mr. Krabs says: "Thanks, Doc."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, you can't beat me!"
Squidward says: "I..."
Squidward says: "and-and you..."
Squidward says: "and I..."
Squidward says: "and then you..."
Squidward says: "swam..."
Squidward says: "down the drain..."
Squidward says: "and..."
Squidward says: "beat me..."
Squidward says: "to the Krusty..."
Squidward says: "Krab."
SpongeBob says: "Uh, does that mean you're..."
SpongeBob says: "?"
Squidward says: "Yes, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "I am finished with those errands."
