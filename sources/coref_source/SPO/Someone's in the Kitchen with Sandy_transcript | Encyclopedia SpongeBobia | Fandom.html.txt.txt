The episode starts inside in the Krusty Krab kitchen. The camera zooms in on the closet where the buns are stored. Then, it zooms onto one particular bun. Plankton, short of breath, unzips a sesame seed and reveals himself.
Plankton says: "All the way from the bakery, but it will all be worth it when I finally get the Krabby Patty."
Plankton says: "Here we go..."
SpongeBob puts the buns on a Krabby Patty and walks out of the kitchen walking past Squidward.
Plankton says: "Perfect, he's headed for the front door."
Plankton says: "Now it's time to make my exit."
SpongeBob arrives to Sandy's table.
SpongeBob says: "Here you go, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "A special patty for a special friend."
Sandy says: "Why, thanks, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "I sure am obliged."
Sandy says: "I love these things, but it's always a little tricky eating one."
Sandy says: "Pardon me."
Plankton says: "Oh no!"
Plankton says: "What's happening?"
Plankton jumps out of the seed. Sandy starts messily eating the Krabby Patty.
Plankton says: "Eeeew!"
Plankton says: "No water!"
Plankton says: "Can't breathe!"
Plankton faints. Later, Sandy returns to the tree dome and enters the tree.
Sandy says: "La da da da dee da da da da da dee..."
Sandy enters the bathroom and takes off her diving suit. Sandy turns on the shower and steps in.
Sandy says: "Time to get this stinky thing off!"
There is a tearing sound as Sandy grabs the fur on her head and literally rips the fur pelt and bikini down the middle, revealing her pink body clad in only panties and a padded bra. She steps out of her fur, picks it up and smells it.
Sandy says: "Whew!"
Sandy says: "Boy, that's ripe."
She hangs it up, gets back in the shower, and starts shampooing her bald head.
Sandy says: "A-doop-doo, a-doop-doop-doo..."
Water splashes onto Plankton, reviving him.
Plankton says: "What's going on?"
Plankton says: "Where am I?"
Sandy says: "♪..."
Sandy says: "A-doop-doop-doo, a-doop-doop-doo, scrub scrub scrub in the tub tub tub..."
Plankton looks at Sandy, who is facing away from him.
Plankton says: "What in Neptune's ocean is that repulsive thing?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Sandy, unaware, turns around.
Sandy says: "Mm-mm!"
Sandy says: "Nothing like a hot shower to make a squirrel feel like a new woman!"
Sandy turns away again.
Plankton says: "Sandy Cheeks?"
Plankton says: "But where's her fur?"
Plankton sees the fur hanging on its hook.
Plankton says: "Wow!"
Plankton says: "Wait a minute!"
Plankton says: "That's it!"
Plankton says: "I think I found out how to get the Krabby Patty formula once and for all!"
The camera faces Sandy, who is scrubbing her bra with soap as if she is washing her breasts. In the background, Plankton rolls Sandy's helmet off-screen.
Sandy says: "♪Shoobie doop doo, shoobie doop doo..."
Sandy says: "I'm getting clean..."
Sandy says: "no fleas on me..."
Sandy says: "getting clean..."
Plankton stuffs the pelt into Sandy's helmet, leaves the bathroom, and locks Sandy in.
Plankton says: "Hope you like long showers, squirrel!"
Later, at the Chum Bucket, Plankton arrives with Sandy's pelt.
Karen says: "Was there an accident?"
Karen says: "What is that?"
Plankton says: "Our ticket to the Krabby Patty formula, that's what that is!"
Karen says: "Oh no."
Karen says: "You can't be serious."
Plankton says: "As serious as a shark attack."
Back at the tree dome. Sandy turns off the shower, dries her face with a towel, and wraps it around her body.
Sandy says: "Aaaaaahhh!"
Sandy says: "Now it's time to out my stinky fur coat!"
Sandy walks over to the hook and notices her pelt is gone.
Sandy says: "What in tarnation!"
Sandy says: "?"
Sandy quickly heads for the door.
Sandy says: "Maybe I left it outside..."
Sandy tries to open door.
Sandy says: "I'm locked in!"
Sandy kicks the door down and steps out, furious. She rips the towel off her body.
Sandy says: "Some low-life varmint stole my things and broke into my home!"
Sandy says: "My home!"
Sandy says: "I'm going to get that son of a guitar stringer!"
Sandy puts a coffee pot over her head as makeshift helmet. Back at the Chum Bucket, Plankton has made Sandy's pelt into a Sandy Robot. Controlling the robot in a seat in its mouth, he makes it stand up.
Plankton says: "Okay Karen, wish me luck!"
Karen says: "Repulsive..."
Plankton says: "Heh heh."
Plankton says: "This is going to work like a charm."
Sandy Robot stumbles out of Chum Bucket, down the road, and bumps into Larry Lobster.
Plankton says: "Watch where you're standing, coral brains!"
Larry says: "Sandy?"
Larry says: "You don't look so good."
Larry says: "Hey, you got to stop eating at the Chum Bucket."
Larry says: "That stuff will rot your insides."
Plankton/Sandy Robot says: "Lies, lies!"
Plankton/Sandy Robot says: "The Chum Bucket will always be my favorite restaurant!"
Larry bends in close to Sandy.
Larry says: "Sandy, you don't sound like yourself."
Plankton closes the pelt's mouth, hiding him from view.
Plankton says: "No, Sandy is herself."
Plankton says: "No reason to be sus-pic-ious in any way, y'all."
Sandy Robot begins to walk away.
Larry says: "Well, as long as there's no reason to be suspicious."
Plankton says: "That was close."
Plankton says: "I gotta perfect that Texas drawl."
Sandy Robot passes two fish at a bus stop.
Plankton/Sandy Robot says: "Yee-ha!"
Plankton/Sandy Robot says: "Yee-ha, yee-ha, yee-ha!"
Sandy Robot smashes through the Krusty Krab's door and passes Harold.
Plankton/Sandy Robot says: "Howdy, partner!"
Sandy Robot knocks down door to kitchen and walks in.
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, you're back!"
Plankton/Sandy Robot says: "Yep, that Krabby Patty was so darn good I got to see how y'all make one!"
SpongeBob says: "Say, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "You look..."
SpongeBob says: "different."
Plankton says: "Uh, what are y-y'all talking about, SpongeBob?"
Plankton says: "It's your old pal, in the living fur."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, but something about you is different..."
SpongeBob says: "I just can't put my finger on it."
Plankton says: "Please don't put your finger on it."
SpongeBob says: "I got it!"
SpongeBob says: "You're not wearing your spacesuit  and helmet!"
Plankton/Sandy Robot says: "Uh..."
Plankton/Sandy Robot says: "yeah."
Plankton/Sandy Robot says: "That's..."
Plankton/Sandy Robot says: "uh..."
Plankton/Sandy Robot says: "cause..."
Plankton/Sandy Robot says: "uh..."
Plankton/Sandy Robot says: "I just breathe underwater now, it's as simple as that."
SpongeBob says: "Let's get cooking!"
Plankton sighs of relief and SpongeBob brings out a basket of patties, picks up one, and sniffs it.
SpongeBob says: "Ahhh, the gooey freshness that is the Krabby Patty patty."
Plankton says: "Let me stop you there, SquarePants."
Plankton says: "I'd be much obliged to know how y'all make one of them there patties."
SpongeBob says: "Hohohoho."
SpongeBob says: "No can do, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "That would require revealing the secret formula."
SpongeBob says: "And that is explicitly forbidden as per my current labor contract."
SpongeBob shows Sandy robot a packet of paper titled "Krusty Krab industries Labor Agreement".
Plankton says: "Yeah, but this is yer old buddy Sandy Cheeks."
Plankton says: "Why, you and me are as closer and two catfish in a skillet."
SpongeBob says: "Ah, Sandy, 44-929b specifically prohibits the disclosure of the secret formula to friends, even when those friends are, quote, "closer and two catfish in a skillet."
SpongeBob shows the Sandy robot section 44-929b.
Plankton says: "Curse you, Krabs..."
Plankton says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "But I can show you all the other ins and outs of making a steamy Krabby Patty."
SpongeBob says: "First, I make sure I'm at the comfortable grilling temperature of 274 degrees."
SpongeBob sets the grill to 274 degrees.
SpongeBob says: "And we are guh-rillin'."
Plankton says: "An' approximately how long do you cook a patty?"
SpongeBob says: "A Krabby Patty is cooked for exactly 283 seconds on each side."
Plankton says: "283 seconds."
Plankton says: "I can't believe I'm getting all this straight from the source."
Plankton says: "How could this get any easier?"
Mr. Krabs bursts through the door and sets the Krabby Patty formula on a table.
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm putting the secret Krabby Patty formula out in plain sight."
Plankton jumps through the eye holes.
Plankton says: "Yee-haw!"
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs stare at the Sandy Robot.
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah..."
Mr. Krabs says: "anyway, I'm going to leave it out here while I clean out the safe."
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't let it out of your sight, boy-o."
SpongeBob says: "You can always count on me, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "K."
Plankton says: "Oh-ho ho, man!"
Plankton says: "That secret formula is as good as mine."
Meanwhile, Sandy looks at the town, her panties are covered by a clump of seaweed.
Sandy says: "That no-good who nabbed my pelt surely came here."
Sandy says: "Probably wanted to cash it in on the Bikini Bottom black market."
Sandy says: "Well, not if I catch that varmint ( first."
Sandy enters the town, and runs into Harold.
Sandy says: "You!"
Sandy says: "You seen anybody in these parts hauling a fur pelt?"
Harold looks at Sandy's pink, hairless, scantily clad body and laughs hysterically.
Harold says: "Look!"
Harold says: "A naked chipmunk!"
More fish gather around Sandy and laugh hysterically.
Sandy says: "Chipmunk?!"
Sandy says: "!"
Sandy says: "What is so funny about having my fur stole?"
Random Fish says: "Aren't you ashamed of having your pink rat flesh exposed?"
Everyone says: "Yeah!"
Sandy says: "With this much attention, that no-good fur thief will see me coming a mile away."
Sandy says: "I best find something to cover my hind end."
Sandy darts into an alley and hides behind some garbage cans. She notices a seaweed bush and rips some seaweed off. She makes the seaweed into a "grass skirt," which she puts on.
Sandy says: "Time to go catch me some scum!"
Back at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob says: "Now that we're grilling, we can work on the fixings!"
SpongeBob says: "See, there are two patties here."
SpongeBob says: "But before we get into slicing and dicing we always start with the washing."
SpongeBob says: "We'll begin with the seaweed."
SpongeBob begins to wash a slice of seaweed, Plankton watches the formula across the table in front of him.
Plankton says: "Okay, I'll stand on that side for a better view."
SpongeBob says: "Okey dokey, but pay close attention, for cleanliness is the public's last defense against a life of horrible disease."
Plankton says: "There it is."
SpongeBob says: "Always ensure that your brush is adequately lathered..."
SpongeBob says: "always making sure to get both sides..."
Plankton says: "That's nice."
Plankton says: "That's interesting."
Sandy Robot reaches for the formula.
Plankton says: "Almost there..."
SpongeBob is drying the seaweed with a blow dryer.
SpongeBob says: "Then lay it down onto the drying rack and we'll engage our drying phase, hmm."
Sandy Robot is about to grab the formula.
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
Sandy Robot turns around.
Plankton says: "What, nothing!"
SpongeBob says: "Remember, never over dry."
SpongeBob says: "Otherwise, the seaweed becomes brittle and cracks."
Across town, Sandy is warming her body by a vent, looking around for the thief who took her pelt.
Sandy says: "That dastardly rustler's got to be somewhere in these parts."
Sandy's seaweed skirt overheats and shatters into pieces like a mirror, exposing Sandy's purple panties.
Police says: "Hey, look!"
Police says: "A hairless goat!"
Sandy, embarrassed and humiliated, flees. She runs behind a park bench and a surfboard, covering her panties. Bikini Bottomites point and laughing hysterically, and a reporter takes a picture. Back at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is making Sandy Robot finish by putting the top bun on the patty.
SpongeBob says: "Steady, steady..."
SpongeBob says: "nice."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, you're off-center by 3."
SpongeBob says: "6 millimeters."
SpongeBob says: "Mmmph, try it again, Sandy."
Plankton says: "Aaugh!"
Plankton says: "This is getting so tedious!"
Plankton/Sandy Robot says: "Maybe you should demonstrate a few more times so I can get the hang of it."
SpongeBob says: "Or, we could address your problem areas directly."
SpongeBob says: "Are you struggling with the final wrist flick?"
SpongeBob says: "Or is your difficulty with the initial transfer move?"
Plankton says: "Aah!"
Meanwhile, Sandy, panting, takes refuge in some bushes.
Sandy says: "I'm tired of running."
Sandy says: "Time to take a stand."
Sandy steps out of the bushes. A random fish gasps and turns her baby's stroller away from Sandy.
Random Fish says: "A nudist ferret!"
Another fish pushes her kids away.
Fish says: "Get in the car, kids!"
Sandy says: "It's not my fault!"
Sandy says: "I..."
An angry crowd pelts Sandy with juice boxes. She dives back into the bushes and notices an open manhole.
Sandy says: "I better go underground."
Sandy jumps into the manhole and hides in the sewer, feeling miserable.
Sandy says: "What am I going to do?"
Sandy says: "If I'm ever going to catch this thug, I'm going to need some help."
Back at the Krusty Krab, Sandy robot tries to put the bun on again.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, still off by that much."
SpongeBob says: "Try it again."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, try again."
Plankton tries again.
SpongeBob says: "Eh, try again."
Plankton says: "Arrrgghh!"
Plankton says: "You try it again!"
Plankton says: "I'm making my move!"
Sandy Robot grabs the formula and swallows it.
Plankton says: "It's finally mine!"
Plankton says: "Time to kick this baby into four-paw drive!"
Sandy Robot runs out of the kitchen on all four feet and legs.
SpongeBob says: "Wait, Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "We can work this out!"
Sandy enters the Krusty Krab through a hole in the floor and immediately notices the Sandy Robot.
Sandy says: "My pelt!"
SpongeBob rushes out of kitchen.
SpongeBob says: "Mr Krabs, Sandy's making off with the formula!"
Mr. Krabs, dressed like a maid and vacuuming out the safe, rushes over. SpongeBob sees Sandy facing off Sandy Robot.
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, you're naked!"
SpongeBob says: "And you don't have any clothes on!"
Sandy says: "Unhand my pelt, you unknown varmint!"
Plankton pops out Sandy Robot's mouth.
Plankton says: "Only from my cold, dead feelers!"
Sandy says: "Plankton!"
Sandy says: "I should have known this was your doing!"
Sandy says: "Now feel this!"
Sandy punches Sandy Robot.
Sandy says: "Hi-ya!"
The Sandy Robot is undamaged so Sandy kicks it.
Sandy says: "Pwaaaaa!"
The Sandy Robot is punched and knocked into the wall and slumps over. Sandy rolls up her pelt and Plankton and the formula flies out. Mr. Krabs catches the formula, Sandy catches Plankton.
Sandy says: "Gotcha!"
Sandy says: "And now for the appropriate punishment for a no-good, yella' belly like yourself."
Sandy puts Plankton in a jar of mustard.
Plankton says: "My eye!"
Plankton says: "This condiment is highly irritating to my eye!"
Sandy's fur pelt is on the ground, Mr. Krabs is shaking its hand.
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, thank you, Sandy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Thank you, Sandy."
The real Sandy turns around, Her panties are obscured by a Krusty Krab table.
Sandy says: "Uh, sure, Mr."
Sandy says: "Krabs."
Police says: "We'll take that sicko off your hands."
Sandy says: "Cops!"
Sandy says: "Thank goodness you're here."
Sandy says: "Take this sicko away!"
Police says: "Actually, we're referring to you, ma'am."
Police says: "Public nudity is against the law in this county."
Police says: "But don't fret."
Police says: "You'll look just fine in prison orange."
Sandy looks at her body and sighs gloomily.
