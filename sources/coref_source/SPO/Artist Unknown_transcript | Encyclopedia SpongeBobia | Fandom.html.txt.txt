Squidward says: "Ah, how I have dreamed of this day."
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Tentacles, Professor of Art."
Squidward says: "What a marvelous opportunity for the people of Bikini Bottom."
Squidward says: "Bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and I will shape them into my image."
Squidward says: "I'll go down in history."
Squidward says: "Someday, there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world!"
Janitor says: "Dude, you're teaching art at the Rec Center."
Janitor says: "Calm down."
Squidward says: "Uncultured trash urchin."
Squidward says: "9 AM."
Squidward says: "Time to let the class in."
Squidward says: "Well, don't want to keep them waiting any longer."
Squidward says: "Welcome to art class!"
Nat says: "Oh, isn't this cooking?"
Nat says: "Sorry."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Are you taking this art class, too?"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob?"
Squidward says: "In art class?"
Squidward says: "Wait!"
Squidward says: "This is cooking!"
Squidward says: "Come back!"
Squidward says: "You gotta be kidding."
SpongeBob says: "This is great!"
SpongeBob says: "You and me in school together."
SpongeBob says: "So, where's the teacher?"
Squidward says: "You're looking at him."
SpongeBob says: "You are the teacher?"
SpongeBob says: "To my pupil?"
SpongeBob says: "This isn't art class, it's Heaven."
Squidward says: "Yeah."
Squidward says: "Grab a little piece of Heaven and let's get with it."
SpongeBob says: "I'm ready, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Tentacles."
Squidward says: "So, you wanna be an artist, eh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, please."
Squidward says: "Well, art is not all fun and games."
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "work."
Squidward says: "OK."
Squidward says: "First, repeat after me: I have no talent."
SpongeBob says: "I have no talent."
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Tentacles has all the talent."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Tentacles has all the talent."
Squidward says: "If I'm lucky, some of Mr."
Squidward says: "Tentacle's talent may rub off on me."
SpongeBob says: "If I'm lucky, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Talent will rub his tentacles on my art."
Squidward says: "Whatever."
Squidward says: "Ok."
Squidward says: "Since you're telling me you have no prior training, we'll have to start from square one."
Squidward says: "Or should I say circle one."
Squidward says: "Am I going too fast for you SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "How's this, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "What the?"
Squidward says: "How the?"
Squidward says: "A perfect circle?"
Squidward says: "Do it again."
Squidward says: "Show your process."
SpongeBob says: "Well, first, I draw this head,  then, I erase some of the more detailed features, and one, two, three..."
SpongeBob says: "a circle, uhh, thingy."
Squidward says: "Gimme that."
Squidward says: "Forget the circles."
SpongeBob says: "Ooh, nice one Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Let me try."
SpongeBob says: "Looky, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "It's you and me playing leapfrog."
SpongeBob says: "That's you on the bottom."
Squidward says: "Gimme that."
Squidward says: "What are you doing now?"
SpongeBob says: "I call it: Rippy Bits."
SpongeBob says: "You take a bunch of old ripped up paper, and make a new picture out of it."
SpongeBob says: "See?"
SpongeBob says: "You're on top..."
SpongeBob says: "this..."
SpongeBob says: "time."
Squidward says: "Do you want to learn art, or not?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Squidward, I'll listen."
Squidward says: "Alright, SpongeBob, pay close attention."
Squidward says: "Look at your marble."
Squidward says: "Visualize the sculpture within."
Squidward says: "And gently..."
SpongeBob says: "How's this Squidward?"
Squidward says: "There, now it's art."
SpongeBob says: "Ohhh, it's so obvious."
SpongeBob says: "I would've never thought of that."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I came here to learn and I arrogantly shunned your lessons."
Monty says: "Hello, there."
SpongeBob says: "But I did deserve that."
SpongeBob says: "And I deserve this!"
Monty says: "Good day, sir."
Squidward says: "Sorry, class dismissed."
Squidward says: "You're too late."
Monty says: "Oh, I beg your pardon, but I've forgotten my manners."
Monty says: "My name is Monty P."
Monty says: "Moneybags."
Squidward says: "The world famous art collector?"
Monty says: "The one and only."
Squidward says: "Well, what are you doing here?"
Monty says: "I'm on a shopping spree."
Monty says: "Buying art for my new museum."
Squidward says: "Your search is over."
Squidward says: "I am Bikini Bottom's greatest artiste."
Squidward says: "I call this one: "Squidward en repose"."
Monty says: "I, uh, don't think that will fit in with the other pieces in my collection."
Squidward says: "Why not?"
Monty says: "Because, it's an art collection."
Squidward says: "How about this one?"
Squidward says: "I call it: Bold and Brash."
Monty says: "More like: Belongs in the Trash."
Janitor says: "Sorry."
Janitor says: "I must've missed that one."
Monty says: "Maybe I should be..."
Monty says: "huh?"
Monty says: "What is that?"
Squidward says: "Wait, wait."
Squidward says: "That's not uh, uh..."
Monty says: "Angelic form, amazing detail, perfect censorship."
Monty says: "This is the work of a true genius."
Monty says: "Hello?"
Monty says: "What this?"
Monty says: "This is the only flaw."
Monty says: "Ah, that's more like it."
Monty says: "I simply must find the artist responsible."
Monty says: "He shall have fame."
Squidward says: "Fame."
Monty says: "Fortune."
Squidward says: "Fortune."
Monty says: "Anything his heart desires."
Squidward says: "Anything?"
Squidward says: "It's me."
Squidward says: "It's me."
Squidward says: "I'm responsible."
Monty says: "I can see it now."
Monty says: "Your name in the world's most prestigious museums."
Monty says: "I'm gonna make you, immortal!"
Monty says: "Now, uh, help me get this in the car."
Squidward says: "I could use a little help."
Squidward says: "My fame!"
Squidward says: "My fortune!"
Squidward says: "My hair!"
Monty says: "Well, that's a bit a bad luck right there."
Monty says: "But, this shouldn't be a problem for an artist of your magnitude."
Monty says: "You can whip up another one."
Squidward says: "Yeah, no problem."
Squidward says: "You know, between you and me, this isn't my best work."
Squidward says: "Why don't you come back tomorrow and I'll have something that will really knock your socks off."
Monty says: "Between you and me, I'm not wearing socks."
Squidward says: "Yeah, no socks."
Squidward says: "OK, see you tomorrow."
Squidward says: "Bye."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob..."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob?"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Go away, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I don't deserve your kindness."
Squidward says: "Hey, cheer up."
Squidward says: "I have decided to give you another chance."
Squidward says: "Why, with a great teacher like me, anything is possible."
SpongeBob says: "Don't look at me Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Don't look at my shame."
Squidward says: "Aww, c'mon SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "You've got yourself a pair of yellow dandies here."
Squidward says: "With my help, we'll turn them into tools of beauty."
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
Squidward says: "Really!"
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
Squidward says: "Really!"
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
Squidward says: "Really."
SpongeBob says: "Wow."
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
Squidward says: "Let's go."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, look."
SpongeBob says: "It's ol' Bold and Brash!"
Squidward says: "Gimme that."
Squidward says: "Ok, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Just do what you did before."
SpongeBob says: "I..."
SpongeBob says: "can't!"
Squidward says: "Ah, ah."
Squidward says: "Wait, wait."
Squidward says: "Let me help."
Squidward says: "Let's start with the circle again."
SpongeBob says: "I did it, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Huh?"
Squidward says: "But, but, what about the head..."
Squidward says: "and the erasing, and the, the..."
SpongeBob says: "I don't know, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "That stuff's not in the book."
Squidward says: "Uhh..."
Squidward says: "How about this, huh?"
Squidward says: "Remember?"
SpongeBob says: "That's not in the book, either."
Squidward says: "Forget about the book!"
Squidward says: "What do all these little bits of paper make you want to do?"
SpongeBob says: "Wait, I know this."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, wait, I think I got it."
Squidward says: "OK, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Let's just move onto the marble."
SpongeBob says: "First, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept."
Squidward says: "Now you've got it."
SpongeBob says: "I've gotta embrace the marble!"
Squidward says: "Right."
SpongeBob says: "I've gotta sniff the marble!"
Squidward says: "Well, uh, ok."
SpongeBob says: "I've gotta lick the marble!"
Squidward says: "Uhh..."
SpongeBob says: "I've gotta be the marble!"
SpongeBob says: "I've got it!"
SpongeBob says: "I have seen the sculpture within."
Squidward says: "Here you go, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "With this tool, I shall give birth to art."
Squidward says: "Oh, boy."
SpongeBob says: "But, one more thing."
SpongeBob says: "â™ªTo the dump, to the dump, to the dump, dump dump."
SpongeBob says: "To the dump, to the dump, To the dump, dump dump."
Monty says: "I'm here for the..."
Monty says: "what the?"
Monty says: "Who is responsible for this?"
Squidward says: "As of now, it's his responsibility!"
Monty says: "You, sir, are the greatest artist who ever lived!"
