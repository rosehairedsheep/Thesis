Mr. Krabs says: "Come out here, boy."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hush boy, or you'll give away the location of me hidey-hole."

SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh-oh."
SpongeBob says: "Who are those guys?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Me shipmates."
Mr. Krabs says: "The toughest bunch to ever sail the briny deep."
SpongeBob says: "Did you have a cool nickname, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Of course!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I was called "Armor Abs Krabs"."
SpongeBob says: "You were?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What do you mean?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I guess you were thinner back then."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, really?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ok, maybe I'm a bit bigger."
Mr. Krabs says: "But I'm still the toughest of the tough."
Mr. Krabs says: "Go ahead, lad, give em a punch."
SpongeBob says: "You want me to punch you in the stomach?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Not in the stomach!"
Mr. Krabs says: "In me armor abs!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow, my entire arm disintegrated."
Mr. Krabs says: "I still got it."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now be a good lad and go get your station in ship shape."
Mr. Krabs says: "And leave an old sea-dog to revel in his memories."
SpongeBob says: "Aye, aye, sir!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Noooooooo!"
SpongeBob says: "Is somebody there?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't look at me!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Leave me be!"
SpongeBob says: "You're alive!"
SpongeBob says: "And naked..."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's true."
Mr. Krabs says: "I've molted."
SpongeBob says: "What's molted?"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's when a crab gets too fat- um, er, outgrows his shell."
Mr. Krabs says: "It falls off!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow."
Mr. Krabs says: "'Armor Abs Krabs' can't show up at the reunion like this."
Mr. Krabs says: "All pink and soft and unmanly."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm all flab and no ab!"
SpongeBob says: "Barnacles!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry about the foul language, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, but you're acting like there never was a man in that shell."
SpongeBob says: "The Krabs of his navy days was fearless."
SpongeBob says: "He wouldn't let something as insignificant as a missing shell slow him down."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah."
SpongeBob says: "Who cares how silly, pink, and fleshy you look."
SpongeBob says: "How non-threatening, limp, and soggy you are."
SpongeBob says: "How..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "oops."
Mr. Krabs says: "I can't go anywhere ever again."
Mr. Krabs says: "Stupid, no good..."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, it sure is dark in here."
SpongeBob says: "Look, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I'm you!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, you're a genius."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I'm glad you got my point."
SpongeBob says: "It's not about what's on the outside."
SpongeBob says: "It's what's on the in..."
Mr. Krabs says: "No, you barnacle brain."
Mr. Krabs says: "Not your silly metaphor."
Mr. Krabs says: "You, in me shell."
Mr. Krabs says: "It gives me an idea."
Mr. Krabs says: "You can go to the reunion and pretend to be me."
SpongeBob says: "I get to be a navy buddy?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Course, you'll need some time to approximate me personality."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, that'll be a snap."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward and I have been doing it behind your back for years."
Mr. Krabs says: "Alright, show me what you got."
SpongeBob says: "Look at me, I'm Mr Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I love money."
Mr. Krabs says: "Heh heh, say that ain't half-bad."
SpongeBob says: "I once won a marathon because someone dropped a penny at the finish line."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's me."
SpongeBob says: "Every night, I tuck me wallet in and tell it a bedtime story."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, okay, I get the point."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, what's that you say?"
SpongeBob says: "Me daughter, Pearl, needs an operation?"
SpongeBob says: "I'll do it me self and save a nickel."
Mr. Krabs says: "That'll do, SpongeBob."
At the reunion.
SpongeBob says: "Well, here goes..."
SpongeBob says: "wow."
SpongeBob says: "I've never seen so many manly naval men."
SpongeBob says: "So tough, so brave, so..."

Mr. Krabs says: "Don't blow this for me, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "I won't let you down, sir."
Mutton Chop says: "Armor Abs Krabs."
Mutton Chop says: "Come join your navy buddies in a toast."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, what have I done?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, boys, let the SS Party drop anchor right here."
Mr. Krabs says: "I've created a monster."
Lockjaw Jones says: "Here's some grog."
Lockjaw Jones says: "You still like pineapple, right?"
SpongeBob says: "Like pineapple?"
SpongeBob says: "I live in one."
Torpedo Belly says: "That Ol' Krabs is manly as ever."
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't believe it."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob is pulling it off."
Mutton Chop says: "Hey, Armor Abs, Ol' Iron Eye here has been itching to punch your legendary gut."
SpongeBob says: "Well, if you think you're man enough."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh-oh, this could be bad."
SpongeBob says: "Fire the torpedoes."
Mutton Chop says: "What do you say, Krabs?"
Mutton Chop says: "Just like old times."
Lockjaw Jones says: "A tooth?"
SpongeBob spits out two more teeth.
Torpedo Belly says: "Teeth."
Torpedo Belly says: "Now, that's manly."
SpongeBob coughs out his skeleton and everyone gasps then cheers.
Mr. Krabs says: "He did it."
Captain says: "Alright, me swabbys, it's time to award the trophy of manly toughness."
Captain says: "To a man who's toughness has stewed the test of time."
Captain says: "And that man is: Eugene Armor Abs Krabs!"
Captain says: "Come up here, Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "This is the best night of my life."
Mr. Krabs says: "Me naval buddies still think I'm manly."
Mr. Krabs says: "And I didn't have to shed myself."
Naval Buddies says: "Armor Abs!"
Naval Buddies says: "Armor Abs!"
Naval Buddies says: "Armor Abs!"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for the trophy, everybody."
Naval Buddies says: "Speech!"
Naval Buddies says: "Speech!"
Naval Buddies says: "Speech!"
Naval Buddies says: "Speech!"
SpongeBob says: "I..."
SpongeBob says: "uhh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Say something."
SpongeBob says: "Let me spin you a manly yarn."
Mr. Krabs says: "'Atta boy."
SpongeBob says: "So there I was, in Jellyfish Fields."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm doomed."
SpongeBob says: "Me supply of bubble soap was dangerously low."
SpongeBob says: "And as I blew my last bubble..."
Mutton Chop says: "Did he say Jellyfish Fields?"
Iron Eye says: "Blowing bubbles?"
Mutton Chop says: "Uhh, what were you doing in Jellyfish Fields?"
SpongeBob says: "Why, jellyfishing, of course."
Naval Buddies says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Phone call for Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get off the stage."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, well, I gotta go."
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, thanks."
Torpedo Belly says: "Where do you think you're going?"
Torpedo Belly says: "Everybody knows there's two things Ol' Armor Abs Krabs would never do."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, no..."
Lockjaw Jones says: "Number one, is spend a penny."
Torpedo Belly says: "And the other one, is leave without giving Ol' Torpedo Belly one of your world famous steely belly butts."
Torpedo Belly says: "Haha."
SpongeBob says: "arr, you don't think I was just gonna collect this here trophy of manly toughness without reminding you silly livers why you give it to me in the first place."
SpongeBob says: "Let's have it."
SpongeBob says: "No holding back."
SpongeBob says: "Give it your all."
Mr. Krabs says: "I can't watch."
Torpedo Belly says: "Armor Abs?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, uhh, I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i, I guess I'll take my manly toughness trophy and head home now."
SpongeBob says: "See you around manville, boys, uhh, men."
Mr. Krabs says: "Noooooooooooooo!"
Mr. Krabs says: "He's not Eugene Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "I am."
Mr. Krabs says: "But I'm certainly no bubble-blowing jellyfisher."
Mr. Krabs says: "No offense, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "None taken, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "C'mon, lad, let's go home."
Mutton Chop says: "Wait a minute!"
Mutton Chop says: "You've forgotten something."
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't understand."
Mutton Chop says: "Admitting you lost your shell is the toughest thing I've ever seen."
Mutton Chop says: "And, uhh, I have a confession."
Torpedo Belly says: "Over here."
Mr. Krabs says: "You, too, Torpedo Belly?"
Torpedo Belly says: "Actually, I had my torpedo removed long ago."
Lockjaw Jones says: "And these aren't the same choppers that I had in the navy."
Iron Eye says: "My iron eye is actually made of Formica."
SpongeBob says: "Look at that, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Your navy buddies all had something to hide."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, poor suckers."
Mr. Krabs says: "At least my shell will grow back."
