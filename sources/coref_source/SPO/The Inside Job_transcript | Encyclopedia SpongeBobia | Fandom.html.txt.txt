Plankton says: "Eh, that's the life."
Karen says: "Plankton!"
Plankton says: "Hey, I was watching that!"

Karen says: "Admit it, the Chum Bucket is a total failure."
Plankton says: "It is not!"
Plankton says: "Business is just slow."
Karen says: "Nyah Nyah Nyah Nyah."

Plankton says: "You?"
Plankton says: "You're just a computer."
Plankton says: "I'm the evil genius around here."
Man says: "This is it, son, The Chum Bucket."
Plankton says: "Looks like this failure has a customer."

Man says: "No, we're not lost."
Man says: "I promised my boy I'd take him to the Chum Bucket today."

Man says: "It's completely covered in grime and filth."
Kid says: "Cool!"
Man says: "Smell that air!"
Kid says: "It makes me want to hurl!"
Man says: "I think the Chum Bucket is the high point of our tour."
Plankton says: "Your tour?"
Man says: "That's right."
Man says: "We're visiting the most disgusting places in bikini bottom."

Plankton says: "Yes."
Karen says: "You'll do what I tell you now?"
Plankton says: "Yes."
Karen says: "Here's all you have to do."
Karen says: "You want the patty recipe, then go to the man who wrote it, Eugene Krabs."
Plankton says: "Right."
Plankton says: "Why didn't I think of that before?"
Karen says: "With my mind connector, you'll be able to read Krabs' mind, transferring the recipe directly into your teeny, tiny, little brain."
Plankton says: "Wow, that's a pretty good idea."
Plankton says: "Whoa!"
Plankton says: "Um, Karen?"
Plankton says: "Whoa!"
Karen says: "Hold still."
Plankton says: "Mmph!"
Karen says: "You'll need this."
Plankton says: "And just how am I supposed to attach it to Krabs' brain?"
Karen says: "Leave that to me, hon."
Doors burst open.
Karen says: "Prepare for launch."

SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Help me, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I've forgotten how to make Krabby Patties."
SpongeBob says: "Please tell me the secret recipe again."
Mr. Krabs says: "Need a little refresher, eh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll run through the Krabby Patty formula one more time."

SpongeBob says: "Me neither."
SpongeBob says: "So we good?"
Mr Krabs says: "Yeah."
Mr Krabs says: "Get out!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
Plankton says: "Enough with these petty carnal senses."
Plankton says: "If I'm going to get the Krabby Patty recipe, I'm gonna have to go to command central."
Plankton says: "Where am I?"
Brain Gary says: "Meow, meow, meow!"
Plankton says: "Ew."
Plankton says: "That's disgusting."
Plankton says: "Now, where do morons keep all their secrets?"
Plankton says: "In convenient alphabetical order."
Plankton says: "Look at that."
Plankton says: ""Sounds that make Squidward upset"?"
Plankton says: ""Patrick's favorite places to be scratched"?"
Squidward says: "What are you doing?"

Karen says: "What?"
Karen says: "Stealing?"
Plankton says: "The Krabby Patty recipe is the delicious sole property of the Krusty Krab."
Karen says: "Oh, brother."
Patrick says: "Hey, everybody!"
Patrick says: "Wait, that's not what I wanted to say."
