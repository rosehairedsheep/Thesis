SpongeBob is standing on a hill looking at his grandma's house.
SpongeBob says: "There it is!"
SpongeBob says: "Grandma's house!"
SpongeBob says: "What wonders await me today?"
SpongeBob says: "Fresh-baked cookies?"
SpongeBob says: "Story time?"
SpongeBob says: "A sweater with love in every stitch?"
SpongeBob says: "Aw, what am I waiting for?"
SpongeBob says: "Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!"
Grandma says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Grandma!"
Grandma says: "Come in and sit for a while."
Grandma says: "Have a cookie, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Grandma, you make the best cookies in the deep blue sea."
SpongeBob says: "Grandma's cookies..."
Grandma says: "Now, who wants to lick the spoon?"
SpongeBob says: "Me, me, me!"
Grandma says: "..."
Grandma says: "and then we drove all the way home with all the windows down in the freezing cold."
SpongeBob says: "Tell me another story about when I was a baby."
SpongeBob says: "Three o'clock?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm gonna be late for work!"
Grandma says: "Hop in my car, I'll drop you off."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Grandma!"
Grandma says: "SpongeBob, you forgot your kissy-kissy!"
SpongeBob says: "I sure did."
SpongeBob says: "Isn't this great?"
SpongeBob says: "Everybody's in a good mood today."
Squidward says: "I love bursting your bubble, SpongeBob, but they're laughing at you, not with you."
SpongeBob says: "Did I do something funny?"
Squidward says: "Your forehead."
SpongeBob says: "My forehead is funny?"
Charlie says: "Hey, hey, Grandma's boy?"
Charlie says: "Kissy-kissy-kissy!"
SpongeBob says: "No, you're wrong!"
SpongeBob says: "There's nothing wrong with getting kisses from your grandma."
Charlie says: "No, especially if you're a big baby who wears diapers!"
Charlie says: "..."
Charlie says: "wears pajamas with feet in 'em, and carries his, um..."
Charlie says: "blankie around, and..."
Customers says: "All right already!"
Squidward says: "Cheer up, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "I know someone who still likes you."
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
SpongeBob says: "You do, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Yeah, your grandma!"
Patrick says: "I'm sorry that happened to you, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Me, too."
Patrick says: "You're the most adult person I know."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Patrick."
Patrick says: "You know how grandmas are, they love babies."
Patrick says: "You just can't act like a baby around her."
SpongeBob says: "You're right, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Have I ever not been right?"
Patrick says: "You're a man now, SpongeBob, and it's time you starting acting like one."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, but I'm not sure I know how."
Patrick says: "Allow me to demonstrate."
Patrick says: "First, puff out your chest."
Patrick says: "Now say, "tax exemption!"
SpongeBob says: ""Tax exemption!"
Patrick says: "Now, you must acquire a taste for free-form jazz."
Patrick says: "This is it."
Patrick says: "What are you gonna tell Grandma?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm a grown up!"
Patrick says: "No ifs, ands, or buts about it!"
SpongeBob says: "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do!"
Patrick says: "And then you get behind her and I'll push!"
Patrick says: "Oh yeah, right."
SpongeBob says: "All we need now is the icing on the maturity cake."
SpongeBob says: "Sideburns!"
Patrick says: "Sideburns!"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, grandmother, but the kissing has to stop."
Patrick says: "Tell her like it is, SpongeBob, no more baby stuff."
SpongeBob says: "He is right, Grandmother."
SpongeBob says: "Kisses are for babies, which I am no longer."
SpongeBob says: "I have grown up."
SpongeBob says: "It is nature's way."
Grandma says: "Oh, you are absolutely right."
SpongeBob says: "I am?"
SpongeBob says: "I mean, of course I am."
Grandma says: "You will definitely not be treated like a baby around here ever again."
SpongeBob says: "I am glad you see it my way, grandmother."
Grandma says: "Well, I'm glad that's settled."
Grandma says: "But what am I going to do with all these fresh baked cookies?"
Patrick says: "Keep 'em coming, Granny!"
SpongeBob says: "So much for no more baby stuff."
Grandma says: "And don't forget the cookie-eating hat!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, that's my cookie-eating hat!"
SpongeBob says: "I mean it was when I was a baby."
Grandma says: "Well, look who's here."
Grandma says: "It's my big old adult grandson."
SpongeBob says: "Grandmother, I need to have a mature conversation with Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick."
Grandma says: "Oh, oh, no roughhousing with a full tummy."
Grandma says: "Who's the baby?"
Patrick says: "I'm the baby, I'm the baby, I'm the baby!"
Patrick says: "Being grown up is boring."
Patrick says: "I love being a baby."
Patrick says: "Besides, I don't get jazz."
Grandma says: "Here's a fresh batch of cookies."
Patrick says: "All right!"
Patrick says: "Rewards, huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, yeah, there's, eh..."
Patrick says: "Oh, Grandma, I'm full."
Grandma says: "More cookies!"
SpongeBob says: "It appears to be my lunch hour."
SpongeBob says: "Grownups have to eat to."
SpongeBob says: "I guess this will have to do."
Grandma says: "Oh, you don't want this baby food."
Grandma says: "How about a big piece of steamed coral?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh yeah, uh..."
SpongeBob says: "great."
SpongeBob says: "Nutritious."
Grandma says: "Storytime!"
Patrick says: "Oh, boy!"
Patrick says: "Storytime, storytime, storytime!"
SpongeBob says: "Storytime?"
Grandma says: "You'll enjoy this, Patrick."
Grandma says: "It's a wonderful story about a magical sea leprechaun."
Grandma says: "Here's the technical manual on routine active maintenance."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, uh..."
SpongeBob says: "great."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
Grandma says: "Hold still, hold still."
Grandma says: "All better?"
Grandma says: "How about I give you a present?"
Patrick says: "Oh, boy, I hope it's cookies!"
Patrick says: "Alright!"
Patrick says: "Another hat!"
Grandma says: "No, Patrick, it's a sweater."
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
Grandma says: "With love in every stitch."
SpongeBob says: "No..."
SpongeBob says: "Don't I get a present, Grandma?"
Grandma says: "Oh, I almost forgot."
Grandma says: "Uh-oh, three o'clock, time for adults to go to work."
Grandma says: "Bye-bye, SpongeBob."
Patrick gets the sweater on.
Grandma says: "I'll bet you'd fancy a nap, huh, Patrick?"
Grandma says: "You still here, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, I don't need to leave yet."
SpongeBob says: "I can be late for work."
Grandma says: "No, no, no, that wouldn't be the adult thing to do."
SpongeBob says: "Alright, I guess I'll be going."
SpongeBob says: "I've, uh, got a lot of adult-type business to take care of, so, uh, I'll see yah later."
Grandma says: "Okay, thanks for stopping by, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Yep, that is it."
SpongeBob says: "Here I go."
Grandma says: "Come again if you get the chance."
SpongeBob says: "Out into the cold, grown-up world alone without a sweater."
Grandma says: "Toodleloo."
SpongeBob says: "I don't know when I'll be back."
Grandma says: "I know how busy you are."
SpongeBob says: "So, uh..."
SpongeBob says: "that's it."
Grandma says: "Shh, he's asleep."
SpongeBob says: "Soooo loooong..."
Grandma says: "Take it easy, SpongeBob."
Grandma says: "You don't have to be a baby to get ol' Grandma's love."
SpongeBob says: "I don't?"
Grandma says: "Of course not."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Grandma."
SpongeBob says: "Uh, Grandma, could you not mention this to the guys down at the Krusty Krab?"
Grandma says: "No problem."
