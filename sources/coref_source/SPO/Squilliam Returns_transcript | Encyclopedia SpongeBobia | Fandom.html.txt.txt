Squidward says: "10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, we'll see you after your lunch break, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Okay."
Squilliam says: "So, I just took my private yacht across my private lake to my private heliport."
Squilliam says: "It's the only way off my private island."
Squilliam says: "On your lunch break, eh, Squiddy?"
Squidward says: "Yes..."
Squidward says: "I mean no..."
Squidward says: "I mean..."
Squidward says: "uhh, uhh..."
Squidward says: "Hey, whatcha been up to?"
Squilliam says: "Oh, just succeeding in everything you've failed in."
Squidward says: "You are no great shakes, Squilliam Fancyson."
Squidward says: "Anyone can be a big shot in a hick town like Bikini Bottom."
Squilliam says: "Oh, is that so?"
Squilliam says: "Let's hear what you've accomplished since high school, Squiddy."
Squidward says: "I'm, uhh, in..."
Squidward says: "food service."
Squilliam says: "Hold it, don't tell me."
Squilliam says: "You're a cashier!"
Squidward says: "I own a five-star restaurant!"
Squilliam says: "Squidward, I had no idea you were such a success."
Squidward says: "That's right."
Squilliam says: "And I would be honored if you would allow me to come to your restaurant tonight."
Squidward says: "T-t-t-t-t-t-tonight?"
Squilliam says: "In fact, we'll all come."
Squilliam says: "My treat!"
Squidward says: "Please, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, you got to help me!"
Squidward says: "When they get here tonight, they're going to see I'm just a big phony and a loser!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, boo-hoo!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Let me play a sad song for you on the world's smallest violin."
Squidward says: "This is serious."
Mr. Krabs says: "I know."
Mr. Krabs says: "This really is the world's smallest violin."
Mr. Krabs says: "See?"
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs!"
Squidward says: "Please let me run the restaurant for just one night!"
Squidward says: "I really need to impress Squilliam."
Mr. Krabs says: "Scrih- Scray- Screh- Squilliam?"
Mr. Krabs says: "That guy who made millions doing what you wish you could do?"
Squidward says: "Don't rub it in."
Mr. Krabs says: "Why didn't you tell me?"
Mr. Krabs says: "We'll take him to the cleaners."
Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs standing straight in a line. Squidward is walking back and forth in a white tuxedo.
Squidward says: "Alright, listen up."
Squidward says: "Men, Squilliam Fancyson will be here in twenty minutes."
Squidward says: "Therefore, we need to turn the Krusty Krab into a fancy restaurant as soon as possible."
Squidward says: "Patrick, what are you doing here?"
Patrick says: "I thought the Corps would help me straighten out my life, sir!"
Squidward says: "The Corps?"
Squidward says: "What the..."
Squidward says: "Pat, this isn't the..."
Squidward says: "oh!"
Squidward says: "Beggars can't be choosers."
Squidward says: "Can you take hats in a dignified and sophisticated manner?"
Patrick says: "You mean like a weenie?"
Patrick says: "Okay!"
Patrick says: "May I take your hat, sir?"
Patrick says: "May I take your hat, sir?"
Patrick says: "May I..."
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, didn't you once serve on the S."
Squidward says: "S."
Squidward says: "Gourmet?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Aye-aye!"
Squidward says: "Then you'll be our chef."
SpongeBob says: "What can I do?"
Squidward says: "I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob, you're going to have to be the waiter."
SpongeBob says: "What's that?"
Squidward says: "It's the guy who goes to tables and takes orders."
SpongeBob says: "Do other restaurants do that?"
Squidward says: "Yes, they do that!"
Squidward says: "Now listen, Squilliam is on his way and you have less than twenty minutes to become a fancy waiter, so read this."
SpongeBob says: ""How To Become a Fancy Waiter in Less Than 20 Minutes."
SpongeBob says: "" Don't worry, Squidward, I'll memorize every page, right down to the punctuation marks!"
Squidward says: "Alright, I've got all the positions filled."
Squidward says: "I just might pull this off!"
Patrick says: "Gimme that hat!"
Squidward says: "He's just the hat-check guy, nothing essential!"
Squidward says: "What happened?"
Squidward says: "What is it?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Peas!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Made 'em the old-fashioned way."
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, you gotta take them out of the..."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's the appetizer."
Squidward says: "But I thought you said you were the head chef on the S."
Squidward says: "S."
Squidward says: "Gourmet?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Did I say that?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No, I cleaned the bathrooms on the Gourmet."
Mr. Krabs says: "I was the head chef on the S."
Mr. Krabs says: "S."
Mr. Krabs says: "Diarrhea."
Squidward says: "There you are!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, you gotta help me!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't do it."
SpongeBob says: "I can't do it, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "Every sentence, every paragraph..."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, hold on!"
Squidward says: "Let's just take a second here to relax."
Squidward says: "Good."
Squidward says: "Now, I want you to empty your mind."
SpongeBob says: "Empty my mind?"
Squidward says: "Empty your mind."
SpongeBob says: "Empty my mind..."
Squidward says: "Empty your mind of everything that doesn't have to do with fine dining."
Squidward says: "Fine dining and breathing."
Smaller SpongeBob #1 says: "Just got an order from the boss: Dump everything that isn't about fine dining!"
Other Smaller SpongeBobs says: "Everything?"
SpongeBob #1 says: "Everything!"
SpongeBob #1 says: "Hurry up!"
SpongeBob #1 says: "What do you think I'm paying you for?"
Smaller SpongeBob #2 says: "You don't pay me."
Smaller SpongeBob #2 says: "We don't even exist."
Smaller SpongeBob #2 says: "We're just a clever visual metaphor used to personify the abstract concept of thought."
Smaller SpongeBob #1 says: "One more crack like that and you're out of here!"
Smaller SpongeBob #2 says: "No, please!"
Smaller SpongeBob #2 says: "I have three kids!"
Squidward says: "How do you feel?"
Squidward says: "Squilliam, you're here!"
Squilliam says: "Hello, Squiddy!"
Squilliam says: "We're all ready to be dazzled by your five-star restaurant."
Squidward says: "Wait, Squilliam, I've got to explain!"
Squilliam says: "Explain what?"
SpongeBob says: "Table for Hommina?"
SpongeBob says: "I can seat you immediately!"
Squidward says: "How did you do all this?"
SpongeBob says: "It was easy, once I cleared my mind."
Squidward says: "But what about Krabs and Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Taken care of."
Squilliam says: "Mmm..."
Squilliam says: "this is fantastic!"
SpongeBob says: "Thank you, sir."
Squidward says: "Pinch me, I must be dreaming."
Squidward says: "Ow!"
SpongeBob says: "If you need anything else, just call."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, I can't thank you enough for all you're doing!"
SpongeBob says: "Fine dining and breathing are all I know how to do."
Squidward says: "It worked."
Squidward says: "I can't believe it!"
Squidward says: "Squilliam thinks I own a five-star restaurant."
Squidward says: "Time to rub it in his face."
Squidward says: "Well, Squilliam, I'm waiting."
Squilliam says: "Alright, I admit it."
Squilliam says: "Everything is fabulous."
Squilliam says: "The food, the atmosphere!"
Squilliam says: "Everything's flawless!"
Squidward says: "In that case, I need you to read this."

Squidward says: "I don't know what has gotten into that..."
SpongeBob says: "More soup for your armpit?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Run for your lives, everyone!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's the appetizer!"
Squilliam says: "Well, Squiddy, I'm waiting."
Squidward says: "Okay, I admit it, I'm a fraud!"
Squidward says: "This was all a futile, pathetic attempt to impress you."
Squidward says: "This isn't really my restaurant."
Squidward says: "I'm just a cashier!"
Squilliam says: "Squidward, I understand."
Squilliam says: "I have a confession to make myself."
Squilliam says: "I made everything up about my life."
Squilliam says: "I have no yachts, jets, or anything."
Squilliam says: "I was only trying to impress you."
Squilliam says: "The horrible, sad truth is, I'm a cashier, too!"
Squidward says: "Is that true?"
Squilliam says: "Of course not!"
Squilliam says: "I'm filthy stinking rich!"
