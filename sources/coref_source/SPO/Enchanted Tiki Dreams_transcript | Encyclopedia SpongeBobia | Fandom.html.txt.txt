SpongeBob says: "Patrick, Squidward is really, really sad."
Patrick says: "You're right."
Patrick says: "Let's go poke someone else."
SpongeBob says: "How about instead, we do something extra special for him!"
SpongeBob says: "Then he won't be sad anymore!"
Patrick says: "Oh, I get it."
Patrick says: "It'll be like the time  I was feeling impressed, and you let me eat all of Gary's..."
Patrick says: "I mean feed Gary for a week."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, this has to be extra special, and we should probably vow to it."
Patrick says: "Vow?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, vow."
Patrick says: "Well, how about instead of vowing, we just do it?"
SpongeBob says: "I like it!"
Squidward says: "I guess having a relaxing evening meant saying up all night with power tools!"

Squidward walks around a bit, drinking his coconut along the way, then comes to a waterfall, goes inside, and takes a shower. Then he comes back out to see a tiki boat waiting for him. He gets in and floats down a stream, drinking the coconut. Then he realizes it is empty and notices a tiki bar ahead and stops.

Squidward says: "What the?"
Squidward says: "Patrick?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "What are you doing here?!"
