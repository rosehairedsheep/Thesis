Mr. Krabs says: "Read this."
Mr. Krabs says: "Heat costs money!"
Mr. Krabs says: "There are two ways to get on my bad side, boys."
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't like kids playing in me yard, and nobody but me touches me thermostat!"
Squidward says: "That's totally selfish!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Your yard is really fun!"
SpongeBob says: "There are kids playing on it right now!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Plankton says: "That's right."
Plankton says: "Run, Krabs."
Plankton says: "For I have found your Achilles heel."
Plankton says: "I'll freeze you out of business and I'll do it with your precious thermostat!"
Mr. Krabs flips the sign to "Closed", which means closing time after their work day. SpongeBob and Squidward wait as Mr. Krabs locks the doors.
Squidward says: "I'm going to go recover from hypothermia."
SpongeBob says: "Hippo what-ia?"
SpongeBob says: "What does that mean?"
Mr. Krabs says: "It means he's a big fat crybaby."
Old Man Jenkins says: "Locked in again."
Plankton says: "That crusty old barnacle might keep me from the secret formula, but I'd like to see him serve a Krabby Patty when I'm done with this place."

Mr. Krabs says: "touching—"
Mr. Krabs says: "thermostat."
Squidward says: "I might need to bring a sweater."

Squidward says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Morning, boys!"
Squidward says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "Aye, aye, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, quit clowning around and get to work."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, sir!"
Squidward says: "As soon as you turn the heat up!"
Mr. Krabs says: "The temperature stays at 62 degrees."
Squidward says: "There's icicles hanging from the ceiling!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't care if Santie Claus and Jack Frost are having ice cream cones!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't..."
Mr. Krabs says: "touch..."
Mr. Krabs says: "THE THERMOSTAT!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Quit your lollygagging and get a move on!"
Squidward says: "Order up."
Martin says: "Let's get out of here."
Plankton says: "Yes, flee that frozen wasteland!"
Plankton says: "Warmth and joy have left your lives!"
Plankton says: "What the--?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Just put those patties back when you're done!"

SpongeBob says: "Yes, sir!"
Clay says: "I want Patty skates!"
Man says: "I need two patties, now!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's beautiful."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm selling twice as many patties and I don't even have to cook 'em!"
Mr. Krabs says: "This is the happiest, and most cost-effective day of me whole life."
Plankton says: "NOOOO!!!"
Plankton says: "How is this possible?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Plankton says: "I freeze his place solid and he turns it into an ice rink!"
Plankton says: "He's making more money than ever!"
Karen says: "That's because, unlike you, he's a good businessman."
Plankton says: "Well, if it isn't the wind beneath my wings."
Karen says: "I don't understand why you don't just steal a Krabby Patty in all that confusion."
Plankton says: "I'll be right back."
Karen says: "I don't know why I encourage him."
Mr. Krabs says: "This is fantastic!"
Mr. Krabs says: "The local hockey team is paying me to practice here!"

Plankton says: "How was your weekend?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, my weekend was fabulous!"
SpongeBob says: "Thank you for asking."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick and I went jellyfishing but I lost my net."
SpongeBob says: "So, I tried to borrow one from Squidward, but he didn't have one."
SpongeBob says: "And then when he yelled at me, he swallowed a bug!"
SpongeBob says: "Swallowed a bug."
Plankton says: "Fascinating."
Plankton says: "Well, got to go."
SpongeBob says: "Hey!"
Plankton says: "Better luck next time, SpongeBob!"
Hockey Player #3 says: "There's the puck, eh?"

SpongeBob says: "Hold it right there, mister!"
Plankton says: "Yes!"
Plankton says: "I'm gonna make it!"
SpongeBob says: "Gotcha, Plankton!"
Plankton says: "On the contrary!"
Plankton says: "It is I who has you!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll take that."
Mr. Krabs says: "Brilliant idea to block the exit with your body, SpongeBob."

SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
