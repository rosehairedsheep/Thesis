Patrick says: "Did someone hit you?"
Patrick says: "Where is he?"
Patrick says: "Yeah, we'll settle this like men."
Patrick says: "We'll sue him."

Sandy says: "Land sakes."
Sandy says: "That's quite a shiner you got there."
Sandy says: "Well, don't you worry none."
Sandy says: "I know some natural remedies that'll..."
SpongeBob says: "Keep your natural remedies to yourself."

Sandy says: "A fight?"
Sandy says: "Well, there's no shame in losing."
SpongeBob says: "Lose?"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, I taught the fish who tangled with me a lesson he shan't soon forget."
Sandy says: "Why?"
Sandy says: "Did he write it down?"
SpongeBob says: "No, I engraved it on his pain gland."
Sandy says: "Well, what type of man scuffles boots with you and loses?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, this was no mere man."
SpongeBob says: "He was the notorious outlaw Jack M."
SpongeBob says: "Crazfish!"
Sandy says: "Jack M."
Sandy says: "Crazyfish?"
SpongeBob says: "It all happened late last night..."
SpongeBob says: "He was so ashamed he ran all the way home leaving behind a pool of tears."
SpongeBob says: "Which I then proceeded to scoop up in my victory tankard and enjoy a nice refreshing beverage."
Sandy says: "So how'd you get the black eye then?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah, that's right."
SpongeBob says: "I had miscalculated the trajectory of my cup and the straw jabbed me in the eye, giving me this awful shiner."
Sandy says: "Well, looks like you're late for your day job, killer."
SpongeBob says: "Ah, phooey."
SpongeBob says: "Late schmate."
SpongeBob says: "A tough guy like me can show up to work whenever he wants."
SpongeBob says: "Adios!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob is 13-1/2 minutes late for duty!"

SpongeBob says: "Yeah, that's right, pal, do the right thing."
SpongeBob says: "Just keep on walking."
Sandals says: "Do you mind?"

SpongeBob says: "That's right."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, I'm..."
SpongeBob says: "Dah-dah-dah-dah, I'm just going to stop you right there, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Spare you the oxygen."
SpongeBob says: "We all know you weaker folk can't afford to waste it."
SpongeBob says: "Now I suppose all of you are wondering how I got this black eye."
Squidward says: "Not really."
SpongeBob says: "All right, who said that?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Was it you, gramma?"
Gramma shakes her head.
Squidward says: "It was me, I said it."
SpongeBob says: "Well, folks, I don't happen to see it as a shiner so much as a shining trophy of my glorious triumph over the forces of evil."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I know what you're thinking."
SpongeBob says: "Who in the name of Neptune would want to tangle with a guy like SpongeBob SquarePants?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I'll tell you who."
Harold says: "Hold it."
Harold says: "Sponges don't have eardrums."
Mr. Krabs says: "He's right."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, let's save all the questions until the end!"
SpongeBob says: "As I was saying..."
SpongeBob says: "I quickly located the source of the cry which was a victim tied at my feet."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "and that's how I got this black eye and gave Jack M."
SpongeBob says: "Crazyfish a whomping of a lifetime."
SpongeBob says: "Whoo..."
SpongeBob says: "football!"
Dale says: "Uh, what did you say he looked like again?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, kind of tall, handlebar mustache..."
Dale says: "Little green hat?"
SpongeBob says: "I kind of thought it was teal, but that sounds like him all right."
SpongeBob says: "Wait a second, how did you know he was wearing a green hat?"
SpongeBob says: "He's..."
SpongeBob says: "real..."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Crazyfish, please don't skin me alive!"
SpongeBob says: "I made all that stuff up."
SpongeBob says: "I was just kidding about whomping you, right folks?"
SpongeBob says: "You remember."
Gramma says: "I liked the part where you told us where how he was crying like a baby."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "So you see?"
SpongeBob says: "I made it all up so I could keep from looking stupid."
SpongeBob says: "Makes sense, doesn't it?"
Jack M. Crazyfish says: "Uh, not really."
Jack M. Crazyfish says: "I'm here because I heard you make a really good Krabby Patty."
SpongeBob says: "One super hot and delicious custom order Krabby Patty with extra sauce, my lord."
SpongeBob says: "Served directly to your waiting  Head and neck area."
SpongeBob says: "Sir, please, I am so sorry."
Jack M.Crazyfish says: "Where I'm from, sorry don't cut it."
Jack M.Crazyfish says: "We settle things in a different kind of way."
SpongeBob says: "No!"
