Patrick says: "Yeah, you'd be ugly again."
Squidward says: "Yes, I'm sure!"
SpongeBob says: "Hmm, how to fix his nose?"
Patrick says: "What if you turn the bottle upside down, maybe it will shrink it?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, that's brilliant!"
Squidward says: "No, wait, don't."
SpongeBob says: "That didn't work."
Patrick says: "Well, try it again."
SpongeBob says: "Hmm."
SpongeBob says: "I think I'll just even him out."
SpongeBob says: "First, a bigger head."
