A note plays.
Sandy says: "That's right, Squidward."
Sandy says: "Let me show you."
Sandy says: "from inside."
Sandy says: "Simple!"
Squidward says: "Why don't you just shrink the reed?"
Sandy laughs.
Sandy says: "Oh, Squidward, always wanting to do it the hard way  We're all set, Squidward!"
Sandy says: "Are you ready for the sedative?"
Squidward says: "Are you sure this is safe?"
Sandy says: "Completely!"
Sandy says: "As long as someone competent is behind the wheel."
Sandy says: "Hey, what's that?"
Sandy says: "Do you think you can handle it, SpongeBob?"

Patrick says: "Wow."
Patrick says: "I've never been in a submarine."
Patrick says: "Let's look inside."
SpongeBob says: "Can't."
SpongeBob says: "I'm guarding it."
Patrick says: "Oh, man!"
Patrick says: "Could you guard it from the inside?"
SpongeBob stops.
SpongeBob says: "You're right!"

Sandy says: "Patrick!"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob!"
Patrick screams.
Patrick says: "Sandy's grown to gigantic size!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't think Sandy grew, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I think we shrunk."
Patrick says: "That's silly."
Patrick says: "Don't you think it's more likely that the entire world grew?"
The robot hand takes the submarine and sticks it in Squidward's nose.
Sandy says: "Hi, Squidward."
Sandy says: "Well, the submarine is safely inside you."
Squidward says: "Wonderful."
Squidward says: "Wait!"
Squidward says: "If you're out here, then who's in here?"

SpongeBob says: "Sandy, where are you?"
SpongeBob says: "Where are we?"

Patrick says: "I thought this place was in bad shape."
Squidward says: "I heard that!"
Sandy says: "Let's get you out of there, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "All you need to do is locate the autopilot."
Sandy says: "It'll safely take you through your mission and then out the extraction point."

Squidward says: "So, how's it going?"
Squidward says: "I can't control my eyeballs!"
Sandy says: "Don't worry, it's temporary."

She takes out a waiver. He signs it.
Squidward says: "Okay, now what is this?"
Sandy says: "Oh, just your autograph for when you're, uh..."

Squidward punches himself.
Squidward says: "Oh."
Squidward says: "Ya think?"
Sandy says: "You're not in control of your actions!"

SpongeBob says: "Natural gas?"
Patrick drinks the soda.
Patrick says: "Like this!"
Patrick burps.
Squidward says: "Stop burping inside me!"
Squidward says: "That's disgusting!"
Sandy says: "Wait a minute, Squidward."
Sandy says: "He might be on to something."
Squidward says: "What?"
Sandy says: "If you can make a big enough burp..."
Patrick says: "We can filter the CO2 through our ballast tanks, refire the engines, and ride the shock wave out of here!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow."
Sandy says: "He's right."
Squidward says: "What?"
Sandy says: "We're going through with your plan, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Yay!"
Patrick says: "What plan?"

SpongeBob says: "It's working!"
The submarine starts up and pops through the bubble and out of the stomach.
SpongeBob says: "Whee!"
Patrick says: "Whee!"
Sandy says: "They're headed for the esophagus."
Sandy says: "Phew, what have you been eating?"
Squidward says: "Morons."
SpongeBob says: "SpongeBob to Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "We've reached the foreign obstruction."
He swims out wearing a swim suit, floaties, goggles, and flippers.
Sandy says: "Okay, you're going to have to go out and dislodge it somehow."
SpongeBob says: "I'm already on it."
He takes out a hammer and hits the reed with it, repeatedly. A card that reads, "Two Hours Later" appears.
French Narrator says: "Two hours later."
SpongeBob says: "This stupid hammer won't break anything."
SpongeBob throws it at the reed. The hammer bounces back and cuts SpongeBob's floaties, making him bounce around. Patrick opens the hatch, wearing goggles.

Patrick says: "Dance!"
SpongeBob says: "You're right Patrick."
