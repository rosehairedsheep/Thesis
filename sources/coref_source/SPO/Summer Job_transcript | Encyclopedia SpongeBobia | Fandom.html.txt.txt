SpongeBob says: "Puff!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't forget to read the note!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hmmm..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Quite a conundrum you have here."
Mr. Krabs says: "It would be a cryin' shame to a certain someone if this information were to leak out to the authorities."
Mrs. Puff says: "Oh, please, don't tell the police, I'll be a dead man if I get caught!"
Mrs. Puff says: "I'll do anything!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's gonna cost a fortune to get this fixed."
Mr. Krabs says: "Thanks to you."
Mrs. Puff says: "Oh, gracious me, I don't have that kind of cash!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't worry!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I think we can work something out."
Mrs. Puff says: "Huh?"
Mrs. Puff says: "You mean we should go out on a date?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Err..."
Mr. Krabs says: "interesting, no, I had something else in mind."
Mr. Krabs says: "Surprise, SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You got a new co-worker."
SpongeBob says: "Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff!"
Mr. Krabs says: "She'll be filling in for Squidward while he's..."
Mr. Krabs says: "..."
Mr. Krabs says: "on vacation!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Isn't that right, Mrs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Puff?"
Mrs. Puff says: "That's right."
Mr. Krabs says: "She'll be working unpaid until he returns."
Mr. Krabs says: "Won't she?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I forgot to tell ya."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're taking a summer off!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Have a good time!"
Mr. Krabs says: "See ya!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Phew!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That was close."
SpongeBob says: "It all sounds a bit mysterious to me."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, but why should I care?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm working with good old Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff!"
SpongeBob says: "Say, did you get my note?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Oh, I got your note alright."
SpongeBob says: "So what do you think?"
Mrs. Puff says: "What did I think!"
Mrs. Puff says: "?"
Mrs. Puff says: "I think it caused me to- Let's just say, it changed my life."
Mr. Krabs says: "It certainly has."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, SpongeBob, would you please show Mrs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Puff her new duties vis-a-vis with her recently changed life?"
Mr. Krabs says: "'Cause I'm sure a snail can't be bothered to do it."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, boy!"
SpongeBob says: "I get to show you the ropes, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, it's kind of like I'm the teacher!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm gonna be teaching you now."
Mrs. Puff says: "Patience is a virtue."
SpongeBob says: "Shall we start with the importance of good kitchen hygiene or the unabridged history of the patty?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Why don't we just start with my basic duties?"
SpongeBob says: "Eager to get behind the wheel, eh?"
SpongeBob says: "I like it."
SpongeBob says: "Repeat after me, this is my register, there are many like it but this one is mine!"
Mrs. Puff says: "There are many like it, but this one is mine."
SpongeBob says: "Now like a ships rudder this old register is temperamental."
SpongeBob says: "When you hit the total key..."
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing?"
SpongeBob says: "You're not taking notes!"
SpongeBob says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Always remember: Good Grades."
SpongeBob says: "Always follow diligent notes!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Always follow diligent notes!"
Mrs. Puff says: "I know, SpongeBob."
Mrs. Puff says: "I taught you that phrase!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff, you can borrow my notepad today!"
SpongeBob says: "Now, where was I..."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yes!"
SpongeBob says: "The total key is a bit sticky, so you're gonna have to be forceful, but not too forceful."
SpongeBob says: "Get it?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Forceful, but not too forceful."
SpongeBob says: "You did!"
SpongeBob says: "Diligence like this deserves a sticker!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Fine..."
SpongeBob says: "Good day, ma lady, charmed, I'm sure."
Mrs. Puff says: "Heh, funny costume, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Forgive me, I know not of this SpongeBob fellow."
SpongeBob says: "My name is Yukthomas Féyêdêmuffin and I entered your place of business in hope to pro-clearing lunch on this fine day."
Mrs. Puff says: "Of course, Mr."
Mrs. Puff says: "Féyêdêmuffin."
Mrs. Puff says: "What would you like to eat today?"
SpongeBob says: "Psst, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff, it's me, SpongeBob, I think it will go smoother if you refer to him as "duke."
Mrs. Puff says: "You mean to refer to you as Duke?"
Duke says: "Of course, how else one refer to me?"
Duke says: "I am a duke after all, now I shall fancy a meal if quite alright with you."
Mrs. Puff says: "Okay, duke, what will you have?"
Duke says: "I shall have..."
Duke says: "beans on toast, please."
Mrs. Puff says: "All right, one beans on toast coming up!"
SpongeBob says: "Psst, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff, SpongeBob again, you better inform the Duke that we don't serve beans on toast."
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you doing yelling at me customers?"
Mr. Krabs says: "The duke here is one of me regulars, and I don't need to explain what happens when you start losing your regularity, do I?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Oh dear..."
Mrs. Puff says: "Message received, Mr."
Mrs. Puff says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Just don't let it happen again, Puff."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I see you have a little trouble getting in gear there, but you'll be in the fast lane before you know it!"
SpongeBob says: "Ah!"
SpongeBob says: "Here comes another customer!"
SpongeBob says: "Let's see if you can apply what you learned!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Welcome to the Krusty Krab, sir."
Mrs. Puff says: "May I take your order?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes!"
Frankie Billy says: "One Krabby Patty please?"
Mrs. Puff says: "$1 please."
Mrs. Puff says: "Thank you."
SpongeBob says: "Good job, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff!"
SpongeBob says: "Now all that's left is to submit the order to the cook."
Mrs. Puff says: "One Krabby Patty!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff."
Mrs. Puff says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "It must have slipped your mind that you need to submit the order in writing as well."
SpongeBob says: "It's the only way to ensure maximum clarity."
Mrs. Puff says: "Fine!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Here's your written form!"
SpongeBob says: "One Krabby Patty."
SpongeBob says: "Uh, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff?"
Mrs. Puff says: "What now?"
SpongeBob says: "I can't begin cooking until the bell is rung."
SpongeBob says: "Order up!"
SpongeBob says: "You done well so far, student!"
SpongeBob says: "Now all that's left is to deliver the item to the customer."
SpongeBob says: "Be cautious, but swift."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I wouldn't go that way if I were you."
SpongeBob says: "It's faster if you go this way, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "P, look out for the barrel!"
SpongeBob says: "Watch for pedestrians!"
SpongeBob says: "And the patty is unscathed!"
SpongeBob says: "Way to go, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff!"
SpongeBob says: "Your first satisfied customer!"
SpongeBob says: "Although, I have to deduct points for that landing though."
SpongeBob says: "Don't forget to read the note!"
Mrs. Puff says: "You!"
Mrs. Puff says: "It's because of you I got stuck in this mess!"
Police says: "Hold it right there!"
Police says: "Well, well, well, if it ain't Mrs."
Police says: "Puff."
Police says: "I saw what you did."
Mrs. Puff says: "I..."
Mrs. Puff says: "you did?"
Police says: "Yeah."
Mrs. Puff says: "Oh please!"
Mrs. Puff says: "I didn't mean to do it!"
Mrs. Puff says: "I swear!"
Police says: "It's too late for swearing, Puff!"
Police says: "The evidence is right here."
Police says: "You littered."
Police says: "Now you're going to the stony lonesome."
Mrs. Puff says: "Littered?"
Mrs. Puff says: "You're absolutely right, officer!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Yes!"
Mrs. Puff says: "I sure did litter!"
Mrs. Puff says: "That's what I did!"
Police says: "Yeah, all right."
Police says: "You're under arrest now."
Mrs. Puff says: "No problem, officer, time by myself in the stoney lonesome is just what I need!"
Police says: "Tell it to the judge, Mrs."
Police says: "Puff!"
Mrs. Puff says: "1 day down, 2,528 to go!"
Mrs. Puff says: "That's just shy of 4 years without SpongeBob!"
Mrs. Puff says: "I'm going to enjoy this!"
Police says: "Get up, Puff!"
Police says: "The judge says you have to go to traffic school."
Mrs. Puff says: "Oh, wow!"
Mrs. Puff says: "A Driver's Education class!"
Mrs. Puff says: "This is just how I made a living except without HIM."
Mrs. Puff says: "Delightful!"
SpongeBob says: "Good day, class!"
Mrs. Puff says: "I must be having a nightmare!"
Mrs. Puff says: "What's he doing here?!"
Mrs. Puff says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Didn't you read the note, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff?"
SpongeBob says: "Here, I taped it together and saved it just in case."
SpongeBob says: "Dear Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff, I'm following in your footsteps and got a job as a Driver's Ed teacher for the summer."
SpongeBob says: "♥ SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Now let's open our Driver's Ed handbooks to Chapter 1."
