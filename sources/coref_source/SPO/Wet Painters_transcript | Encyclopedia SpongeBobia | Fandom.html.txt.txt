French narrator says: "A slow day at the Krusty Krab."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward, check this out."
Patrick says: "A one-way ticket to pain!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "And that's just sick!"
SpongeBob says: "But we were performing a ritual to attract customers."
SpongeBob says: "And the only way the ritual can work is for us to get hurt."
SpongeBob says: "Real bad."
Mr. Krabs says: "What stupid barnacle told you that?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Listen, instead of killing yourselves, I've got something real important for you to do for me."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, are you men ready for your super..."
SpongeBob says: "Super..."
Patrick says: "Super..."

Mr. Krabs says: "assignment?"
Mr. Krabs says: "The two of you are to paint the inside of me house!"
SpongeBob says: "Yay!"
Patrick says: "Yay!"
Mr. Krabs says: "But, let me give you two a warning."
Mr. Krabs says: "This here paint is absolutely permanent."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Yeah, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on."
SpongeBob says: "Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?"
Patrick says: "No way, SpongeBob, we're not getting paid to move stuff."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, we're not getting paid at all."
Patrick says: "Well that's what I said!"
Patrick says: "We're not getting paid and that's final!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, we'll just paint around all this stuff."
Patrick says: "Good, just don't pay me."
SpongeBob says: "First, we need to set up the tarp."
Patrick says: "Tarp ahoy!"
SpongeBob says: "We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Now that's what I'm talking about."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now."
Patrick says: "That will never ever come off."
SpongeBob says: "And if we get it on anything, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs will cut our butts off."
Patrick says: "And mount them on the wall."
Patrick says: "Careful, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, the lid's already off."
Patrick says: "Oh."
Patrick says: "Now it's my turn!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm thinking I should do this one, too, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Well, that was a rip-off."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready."
SpongeBob says: "All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall."
SpongeBob says: "With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall."
SpongeBob says: "Well, here we go."
French narrator says: "One hour later..."
SpongeBob says: "Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall."
French narrator says: "Two hours later..."
SpongeBob says: "I'm getting to the painting."
French narrator says: "Three hours later..."
Patrick says: "Can you move it along?"
Patrick says: "I'm all out of time cards."
SpongeBob says: "Barnacles!"
SpongeBob says: "What could be worse than a giant paint bubble?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "Oh, I know!"
Patrick says: "Two giant paint bubbles!"
SpongeBob says: "Nooooo!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Yeah, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't think this bubble can get much bigger!"
SpongeBob says: "Pat, no!"
SpongeBob says: "We're dead, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Do you know what that is?"
Patrick says: "Hmm..."
Patrick says: "it's a dollar."
Patrick says: "I win!"
SpongeBob says: "That's not just a dollar."
SpongeBob says: "It's Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs' first dollar!"
SpongeBob says: "His most prized possession!"
SpongeBob says: "And we got paint on it!"
Patrick says: "I think you are over-reacting, SpongeBob, I don't see any paint."
Patrick says: "Oh, now I see it!"
SpongeBob says: "This is not good, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "This is not good!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
Patrick says: "Wait, SpongeBob, all we got to do is wash the paint off and Krabs will never know!"
SpongeBob says: "But Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs said..."
SpongeBob says: "Did it work?"
Patrick says: "Nope."
SpongeBob says: "Did it work?"
Patrick says: "Nope."
SpongeBob says: "Did it work?"
Patrick says: "Nope."
Patrick says: "Oof!"
Patrick says: "Oof!"
Patrick says: "Oof!"
SpongeBob says: "Nothing's working!"
Patrick says: "Wait, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "We're not cavemen!"
SpongeBob says: "It didn't work."
Patrick says: "This is all Mr."
Patrick says: "Krabs' fault!"
Patrick says: "If he hadn't hung that stupid dollar in the first place..."
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "I mean, it's not like it looks any different than a regular dollar."
Patrick says: "Why hang it?"
Patrick says: "You could just stick any old dollar bill up on the wall, no one would even know the difference!"
Patrick says: "You might as well reach in my wallet, pull out a dollar, and put it on the wall!"
Patrick says: "And it would..."
SpongeBob says: "Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet."
Patrick says: "I don't see where you're going with this..."
Patrick says: "Hey, a dollar!"
SpongeBob says: "Our butts are saved, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Now all we have to..."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, no!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, no-ho-oh!"
Patrick says: "Wanna bite?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, okay, we still have time!"
SpongeBob's reflection says: "You're on your own, pal."
Mr. Krabs says: "What theâ€¦?"
SpongeBob says: "We're all done, sir."
SpongeBob says: "Everything looks great."
Patrick says: "Yeah, you don't have to look around."
Patrick says: "We already did that for you."
Mr. Krabs says: "You both look like you got a dirty little secret."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ha!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm kidding."
Mr. Krabs says: "Let's see how you did."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, not bad boys, not bad."
Mr. Krabs says: "A nice even coat, high gloss, no bubbles."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, looks great, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "We'll just be going..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Flippin' fish fossils!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Look what you did!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, we're so sorry!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't de-butt me!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't de-butt me!"
Patrick says: "Mr."
Patrick says: "Krabs, I'm sorry!"
Patrick says: "Have mercy!"
Patrick says: "Have mercy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Sorry?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You dusted all my knickknacks!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That was really nice."
Mr. Krabs says: "Great Barrier Reef!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's this?"
SpongeBob says: "That's not our fault, Mr Krabs!"
Patrick says: "We didn't do it on purpose!"
Both says: "Accident!"
Both says: "Accident!"
Both says: "Accident!"
Both says: "Accident!"
Patrick says: "I don't want to be buttless!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, and I suppose the floor molding just painted itself on its own."
Doll says: "Mama."
Mr. Krabs says: "And you boys thought I wouldn't notice."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh well, I guess no harm done."
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, boys, you're free to go."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, what are you doing?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, you know, just "hanging" around."
Patrick says: "Boo!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get down onto the floor, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Alright, now you're just being silly."
SpongeBob says: "No, No, Mr Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't look, it's a trick!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Did you two get paint all over me first dollar?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "We're sorry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Patrick says: "We're so sorry!"
Patrick says: "I thought, you know, maybe he'd buy it."
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, boys..."
Mr. Krabs says: "you know what I've gotta do now?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "You mean our butts?"
Patrick says: "Can I use mine one last time?"
Mr. Krabs says: "There we go, good as new."
Both says: "But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, I lied."
Mr. Krabs says: "This paint actually comes off with saliva!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I get it, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Nah, I just like to mess with ya!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Aw, crud."
Mr. Krabs says: "I really got to learn to say it, not spray it."
