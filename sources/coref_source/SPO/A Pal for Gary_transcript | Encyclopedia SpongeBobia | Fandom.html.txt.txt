SpongeBob says: "Poor little snail just wanted some fun time."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, sir, but the Krusty Krab has a strict no pet policy."
SpongeBob says: "I'm afraid your worm will have to wait outside."
Customer says: "Oh, I could never do that."
Customer says: "He gets far too lonely and upset when he's left alone."
Customer says: "Sorry, buddy, I guess I can't buy you that Krabby Patty you wanted."
Customer says: "Let's just go home."
Mr. Krabs says: "Eh?"
SpongeBob says: "Responsible pet owner."
SpongeBob says: "I leave Gary alone all by himself all day."
