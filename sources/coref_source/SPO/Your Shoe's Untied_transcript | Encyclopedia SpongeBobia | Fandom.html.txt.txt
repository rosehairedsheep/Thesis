Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "Come in!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"

Patrick says: "Uh..."
Patrick says: "My hands?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay..."
Patrick says: "Uh, actually..."
Patrick says: "I have a confession to make."
Patrick says: "I don't know how to tie my shoelaces."
SpongeBob says: "Do you know how lucky you are to have a friend like me?"
Patrick says: "Yes."
SpongeBob says: "Look at this knot."
SpongeBob says: "Have you ever seen a more perfectly executed shoe-fastening bow?"
Patrick says: "Gosh..."
Patrick says: "Probably not."
SpongeBob says: "I learned when I was just a boy, Patrick, and I'm willing to pass on what I know."
SpongeBob says: "Go sit over there  And then you..."
SpongeBob says: "Uh, you gotta..."
SpongeBob says: "Loop the, the..."
Patrick says: "Are you sure you know how to do it?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, please, shoe-tying requires peace and quiet."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, where was I?"
SpongeBob says: "I guess you don't want me to show you how to do it."
Patrick says: "I'm sorry!"
Patrick says: "I won't interrupt anymore!"
SpongeBob says: "I've got it!"
SpongeBob says: "The first rule of shoe-tying is always start with your right foot."
SpongeBob says: "Now the lesson will officially begin."
SpongeBob says: "Get it?"
SpongeBob says: "Knot..."
SpongeBob says: "right..."
SpongeBob says: "hmm..."
Patrick says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, no more fooling around."
Patrick says: "What was that?"
Patrick says: "Are you okay, SpongeBob?"

Squidward says: "Alright, SpongeBob, hand it over."
Squidward says: "Well?"

SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward, I've got an idea!"
SpongeBob says: "How about you come get it?"
Squidward says: "Oh, gee, SpongeBob, that's a great idea."
Squidward says: "And maybe I should cook the patties, and do the dishes, and wear square pants, and live in a pineapple, while you wait in the unemployment line!"

Squidward says: "Then bring that patty here now!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Squidward."
