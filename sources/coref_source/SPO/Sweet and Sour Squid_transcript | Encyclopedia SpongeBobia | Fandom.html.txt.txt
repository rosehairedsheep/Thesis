The episode starts at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is making Krabby Patties when he pulls an instrument out of his pocket to check the tune.
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, what is that horrible racket coming from back here?"
SpongeBob says: "Just a little grill-side harmony."
SpongeBob says: "Everyone knows that cooking and music go together like..."
SpongeBob says: "eating and listening."
Squidward says: "You wouldn't know what real music is if it came up and hit you in the face."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, that happened to Patrick once."
SpongeBob says: "He must've been listening to hard rock."
SpongeBob says: "He had a lump on his head—"
Squidward says: "I don't care!"
Squidward says: "If you want to hear what real music sounds like, then listen to this."
Squidward says: "Hey, give it back."
Squidward says: "I was just reaching my coda."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, well your coda is affecting me quota."
Mr. Krabs says: "The shrill piercing racket of your fish flute is frightening away me money."
Squidward says: "Fish flute?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, I don't know."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's what they used to call it back in the—"
Squidward says: "None of you simpletons would recognize real musical talent if it came up and kicked you in the face!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, that happened to Patrick once, too!"
SpongeBob says: "He—"
Squidward says: "Not a single one of you!"
Squidward says: "Not even..."
Squidward says: "even—"
Squidward says: "oh, there's nobody there."
Plankton says: "He's still doing it, Karen."
Plankton says: "He's—"
Plankton says: "Karen?"
Karen says: "Who's doing what, now?"
Plankton says: "The skinny one."
Plankton says: "Karen, for the first time, it's hit me!"
Karen says: "What, the door on your way out?"
Plankton says: "No, computer-brain."
Plankton says: "The skinny one may have been the gateway to the secret formula all along."
Plankton says: "As a veteran employee, he must know the secret formula, too."
Karen says: "I warn you against it."
Plankton says: "Too late!"
Squidward says: "Who said that?"
Plankton says: "Down here!"
Plankton says: "I am just an innocent passerby who felt the need to stop and tell you what a magnificent garden you have."
Squidward says: "Oh, really?"
Plankton says: "Yes."
Squidward says: "Well, let me tell you something, mister."
Squidward says: "I know exactly who you are and why you're here."
Plankton says: "You do?"
Squidward says: "You will not get me to eat at the Chum Bucket, no matter how big the discount is."
Plankton says: "Well, that's not exactly why I—"
Squidward says: "Shameless."
Squidward says: "You again?"
Plankton says: "I hope you don't mind me painting on your property, but the light here, it's simply transcendent this time of day."
Squidward says: "Why, yes, it is, isn't it?"
Plankton says: "Yes, it—"
Plankton says: "not buying that one either, huh?"
Squidward says: "Nope."
Plankton says: "Hey, buddy!"
Karen says: "Plankton, what are you doing?"
Plankton says: "There's nothing a little duct tape and surgical tubing can't accomplish."
Plankton says: "Well, that's a fine way to treat a family member."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Plankton."
SpongeBob says: "Nice dress."
Plankton says: "Out of my way, SpongeBrain."
SpongeBob says: "I overheard you and Squidward playing doorslam and I wanted to see if I could get in to the next round."
SpongeBob says: "Don't cry, Plankton."
SpongeBob says: "Doorslam is easy to play."
SpongeBob says: "Hard to master."
Plankton says: "None of my tactics are making any impression on him whatsoever."
SpongeBob says: "Well, let's see."
SpongeBob says: "If you really want to impress Squidward, try talking to him about music."
Plankton says: "Music?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, especially his favorite kind of music, his own."
Plankton says: "Oh, is that right?"
Squidward says: "Not again."
Plankton says: "Wait, don't irrigate me."
Plankton says: "I've come to hear your music."
Plankton says: "It soothes the place my soul would occupy if I had one."
Squidward says: "Are you sure you got the right squid?"
Plankton says: "I've never been sure of anything, but I am sure of this: play for me."
Plankton says: "Fill my ear sockets with the strains of your sweet, sweet magic."
Squidward says: "Finally, someone actually appreciates my brilliance."
Squidward says: "I will play for you, my tiny cyclops."
Squidward says: "I will play such that Neptune himself will hear me upon his very throne..."
Squidward says: "or whatever chair he's sitting on."
Plankton says: "Uh-oh."
Plankton says: "I mean, goodie."
Plankton says: "Sweet mother of Aphrodite!"
Plankton says: "Please make it end!"
Squidward says: "Huh, huh?"
Squidward says: "How are you enjoying the music so far?"
Plankton says: "It's delightful!"
Plankton says: "Encore, encore!"
Plankton says: "Yes, yes, bravo, bravo!"
Plankton says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Gus says: "Did you hear that?"
Nazz-Mimi says: "How could I not?"
Plankton says: "Bravo!"
Lifeguard says: "No, no!"
Lifeguard says: "Make it stop!"
Plankton says: "Encore, encore, encore!"
Squidward says: "I'm so glad you're enjoying the performance."
Plankton says: "Enjoying it?"
Plankton says: "Why, I'm enjoying it so much, it's making me want to..."
Plankton says: "it's making me want to..."
Squidward says: "Want to..."
Squidward says: "sing?"
Plankton says: "That's the word I was looking for!"
Squidward says: "A-one, a-two, a-one, a-two, a-three, a-four."
Plankton says: "♪Skinny arms a flappin' long nose looks real swell."
Plankton says: "Shiny head is bulging he plays really well."
Plankton says: "On the fact that he's a genius you can surely bet."
Plankton says: "This strange-looking blue guy, sure plays a neat clarinet."
Plankton says: "♪  ♪No one does it better."
Plankton says: "He's the best there is."
Plankton says: "When you ask him how he does it he says..."
Squidward says: "It's all in the wrist."
Plankton says: "Hooray!"
Squidward says: "Thank you, thank you."
Plankton says: "Say, uh, musical genius?"
Squidward says: "Yes?"
Plankton says: "When you're not sharing your songs of joy and splendor, one might find you working a shift at the Krusty Krab, correct?"
Squidward says: "It is an unfortunate truth."
Plankton says: "And you've been working there for a pretty long time, haven't you?"
Squidward says: "That's an understatement."
Plankton says: "Well, I..."
Plankton says: "I was just wondering, oh, incredibly musical one, what do they put in one of those Krabby Patties, anyway..."
Plankton says: "secret-wise?"
Squidward says: "Oh, I don't work the grill; I work the register."
Plankton says: "But..."
Plankton says: "surely, you've been near the grill."
Plankton says: "You must've seen something."
Squidward says: "Nope."
Squidward says: "Haven't seen a thing."
Plankton says: "You work in the same place for 20 years and you've never noticed ingredients of the sole item on your menu?"
Plankton says: "Cut the comedy, octopus!"
Plankton says: "I want that formula and I want it now!"
Squidward says: "Oh, don't you see, Sheldon?"
Squidward says: "Thanks to you, I'm getting better and better as a musician."
Plankton says: "What?"
Squidward says: "It's been your constant encouragement that has helped me progress to new musical heights."
Squidward says: "I'm hitting notes I never even knew existed."
Mrs. Puff says: "We have—"
Sandy says: "Mayday!"
Sandy says: "Mayday!"
Squidward says: "In fact, thanks to you, I'm going to quit my job at the Krusty Krab and become a full-time musician."
Plankton says: "But then I'll never get my hands on that secret formula."
Plankton says: "Stop playing this infernal pipe!"
Plankton says: "You're killing me!"
Squidward says: "Hey!"
Squidward says: "Come back!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I heard you and Plankton out here playing "doorslam" and I was wondering if I could—"
Squidward says: "Plankton stole my clarinet and I have to get it back!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoo!"
SpongeBob says: "I wanna play!"
SpongeBob says: "Ouch, Squidward, this game is fun!"
Plankton says: "You'll never catch me, you hear!"
Plankton says: "Never!"
Police fish #1 says: "We've got you surrounded."
Plankton says: "You do?"
Plankton says: "Oh."
Police fish #1 says: "We've received hundreds of reports of an excruciating musical disturbance and you're the only one holding an instrument."
Plankton says: "Wait a minute, I've never seen this instrument before in my life."
SpongeBob says: "He's right, officer."
SpongeBob says: "Plankton doesn't even play clar—"
Mr. Krabs says: "There, there, laddie."
Mr. Krabs says: "Just let the legal system run its course."
Police officer #1 says: "Watch your head."
Plankton says: "No, wait!"
Plankton says: "Please!"
Plankton says: "Karen, help!"
Police officer #1 says: "Oh, you won't be needing this where you're going."
SpongeBob says: "Boy, that was a close one, huh, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "He almost got your clarinet."
Squidward says: "Once again, I hate people."
