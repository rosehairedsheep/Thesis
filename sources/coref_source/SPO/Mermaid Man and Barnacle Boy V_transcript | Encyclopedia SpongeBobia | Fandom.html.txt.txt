SpongeBob says: "You can't give up."
SpongeBob says: "What if we help you?"
Mermaid Man says: "No, no, that's a terrible idea."

Dirty Bubble says: "Did you hear him say anything about eating dirt?"
Barnacle Man says: "Need a hand, superpal?"
Mermaid Man says: "Good to have you back on the side of justice, Kyle."
Mermaid Man says: "Let's go get you that Krabby Patty!"
Man Ray says: "Was that it?"
Man Ray says: "That's sickening!"
Dirty Bubble says: "Oh, this reminds me of the time I went to Cancun with the Killer Shrimp."
Dirty Bubble says: "Oh, they had these papaya drinks that were to die for!"
Mermaid Man says: "How is that adult-sized Krabby Patty treating you, Barnacle  Man?"
Barnacle Man says: "Actually, it's pretty big."
Barnacle Man says: "I'm not sure if I can finish the whole thing."
