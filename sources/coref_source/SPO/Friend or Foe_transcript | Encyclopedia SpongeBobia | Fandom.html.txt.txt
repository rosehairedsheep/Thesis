French Narrator says: "We take you now to Encino, California, where we find the President of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.."
French Narrator says: "flipping burgers!"
French Narrator says: "?"
Patchy says: "Hey, kids!"
Patchy says: "Potty and I took jobs flipping burgers so we could be just like our hero..."
Patchy says: "SpongeBob SquarePants!"
Potty says: "I took the job for the free sodas."
Patchy says: "Potty, don't you have dishes to wash?"
Mr. Pirateson says: "Argh!"
Patchy says: "Oh, hey, kids!"
Patchy says: "Say hello to my boss, Mr."
Patchy says: "Pirateson."
Mr. Pirateson says: "Arrrrrrrrrgh!"
Patchy says: "One order of Scurvy Fries, one large Bilge Water."
Mr. Pirateson says: "Argh!"
Mr. Pirateson says: "Arrrgh!"
Patchy says: "Uh, Diet Bilge Water."
Patchy says: "I'll get right on it sir."
Patchy says: "Ahhhhh!"
Cut to next scene.
Potty says: "P."
Potty says: "U."
Potty says: "!"
Potty says: "What died in there?"
Patchy says: "Oh, Potty, you're just in time to see me new Pirate Patties!"
Patchy says: "I call this one "Buried Treasure"."
Potty says: "Where'd you dig that one up?"
Patchy says: "This one called "Walk the Plank"."
Potty says: "I'm already "board" with that one."
Patchy says: "This'll blow out your old bird brain of yours."
Patchy says: "Behold!"
Patchy says: "The "Patchy Patty"!"
Patchy Patty says: "Ahoy!"
Potty says: "Aw, that's the worst one yet."
Patchy says: "Potty Parrot, you are never supportive of me!"
Patchy says: "I don't wanna be your friend anymore!"
Patchy says: "I never wanna see you again!"
Potty says: "Brawk, Patchy, no!"
Potty says: "Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo!"
Potty says: "Brawk!"
Potty says: "Squawk!"
Patchy says: "You know, this isn't the first time that a patty's come between two good chums."
Patchy says: "It happened once in Bikini Bottom."
Patchy says: "Here, take a look while I..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hmmm, something ain't right."
A two-tiered pink birthday cake on a cart rolls in. The icing reads "Happy Birthday Krabs".
Mr. Krabs says: "For me?"
Squidward says: "Don't you find this a tad suspicious?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Suspicion doesn't hold a candle to birthday wishing."
Mr. Krabs is about to blow out the candle when Plankton pops out from underneath the candle.
Plankton says: "Surprise!"
SpongeBob and Squidward scream. Plankton, smiling deviously, takes out the candle and uses it to release the balloons. Like dynamite, the balloon strings burn up and the balloons pop as confetti goes everywhere. The light from the popping blinds the customers as confetti gets into their eyes. Plankton's cart engages in its jet pack and launches itself into the kitchen.
SpongeBob says: "Duck!"
Plankton says: "Disengage!"
Plankton releases the bottom part of the cake onto the safe in the kitchen. Plankton lands the upper cake part onto the floor and hits a button on the control panel. The cake explodes, causing icing to go onto SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs and Squidward's faces. Plankton takes the formula and flies out of the kitchen.
Mr. Krabs says: "Me secret formula!"
Plankton says: "Happy Birthday, Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't forget your condiments, Plankton."
Mr. Krabs says: "Attaboy, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Safe!"
Plankton says: "You'll rue the day we were born, Krabs."
Plankton says: "I'll be back."
SpongeBob says: "Why, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "Why does he hate us so?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, you might as well blame me, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Best friends?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Friends at birth, you might say."
Mr. Krabs says: "Even as wee ones..."
Mr. Krabs began to recall himself and Plankton as babies, which was the time they were born.
Baby Plankton says: "Goo."
Everyone says: "Aw!"
Cut to flashback of Krabs and Plankton's third birthday. There's a birthday cake reading "Big Boys". Toddler Krabs inhales, then sticks out his tongue to get Plankton to blow out the candles.
Mr. Krabs says: "..."
Mr. Krabs says: "until we hit grade school."
In a classroom, kids are in science class, chattering and doing chemistry as the teacher reads at his desk. Krabs, as a kid, is writing on paper as Plankton, also a kid, holds up two test tubes in his gloved hands.
Young Eugene says: "Hey, Planky."
Young Eugene says: "What'cha doing?"
Kid Plankton says: "Oh, just a little something I thought I'd try out."
Billy says: "How's this for a science experiment, Mr."
Billy says: "Brainatron 5000?"
Kid Plankton says: "They'll pay for this one day, Eugene!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Darn tootin'."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, barnacle brains, I think you owe Plankton an apology."
Classmate #2 says: "Yeah."
Classmate #2 says: "Where'd you do your clothes shopping, the trash can?"
Mr. Krabs says: "..."
Mr. Krabs says: "."
Mr. Krabs says: "fashion me clothes from rags."
Mama Krabs says: "There you go, son."
Mama Krabs says: "Your outfit's all finished."
Mama Krabs says: "It's a good thing Old Man Jenkins was kind enough to spare his last washcloth."
Old Man Jenkins says: "Oops."
Old Man Jenkins says: "I missed a spot."
Krabs and Plankton are walking through the carnival grounds, with Plankton conversing with him. Krabs has a box around his body.
Mr. Krabs says: "Then one day, as Plankton and I plotted our revenge, I met the love of me life."
Kid Mr. Krabs says: "What in Neptune's name is that?"
Kid Mr. Krabs says: "It's the most beautiful thing me eyes have ever seen!"
Kid Mr. Krabs says: "What is it?!"
Kid Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Kid Plankton says: "It's money."
Mr. Krabs says: "Moneyyyyyyyyyy?"
Plankton says: "Yeah."
Plankton says: "You can buy things with it."
Kid Mr. Krabs says: "Buy things?"
All says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "Got your secret recipe, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "You have no idea what that went through to get here."
Mr. Krabs says: "I've got a pretty good idea, yeah."
SWAT Fish #4 says: "So, if you guys were such great friends, what happened?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "What did happen next?"
Squidward says: "Yeah."
Squidward says: "I really wanna know."
Mr. Krabs says: "Listen up, Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Because this is where it gets juicy."
Mr. Krabs says: "It all started in a place called "Stinky Burgers"."
Mr. Krabs says: "It was the only place to get a burger."
Mr. Krabs says: "The kids loved Stinky."
Mr. Krabs says: "And Stinky loved the kids."
Stinky says: "Now, what can I do for you, young 'uns?"
Billy says: "Uh, Mr."
Billy says: "Stinky?"
Billy says: "I'll have one burger, please!"
Bully #3 says: "Me, too, Stinky!"
Stinky says: "Oh, now, now, kids."
Stinky says: "There's plenty of burgers for everyone."
Big Johnny says: "That's why we like you so much, Stinky."
Big Johnny says: "You always deliver the goods."
Bully #5 says: "We don't like Stinky, we respect him."
Stinky says: "Well, which one is it, kids?"
Stinky says: "Do you like or respect me?"
Big Johnny says: "Like!"
Bully #5 says: "Respect!"
Big Johnny says: "Like!"
Bully #5 says: "Respect!"
Stinky says: "Okay, let's just meet in the middle and say you li-spect me."
Mr. Krabs says: "Excuse us!"
Plankton says: "Valuable customers coming through."
Big Johnny says: "What are those dorks doing here?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Two Stinky Burgers, please."
Stinky says: "Did your brains dribble out all over the sidewalk you slept on last night?"
Stinky says: "If it's burgers you want, go around back."
All says: "Yeah, Stinky!"
Billy says: "Thanks for keeping the nerds out."
Bully #2 says: "You're the best, Stinky."
Stinky says: "Okay, that's enough, kids."
Stinky says: "Gather around, children."
Stinky says: "There's something I want to tell you."
Stinky says: "What I have to say is very important."
Stinky says: "If you remember one thing for the rest of your life, remember that without your kind patronage, I'd be a penniless loser like Rag Boy."
Plankton says: "Did you hear that, Krabs?"
Plankton says: "By flipping burgers for those cretins, he was able to gain their li-spect."
Mr. Krabs says: "Did you see that fat stack of loot?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I bet if someone made a better burger, they'd have a fatter stack of loot."
Mr. Krabs says: "But who has the ability to make such a burger?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Who has the skill?"
Plankton says: "Skill, schmill, Krabs, baby."
Plankton says: "Who needs skill when science is on your side?"
Plankton says: "We'll make that burger, and when we do, we will rule the school!"
Patchy says: "I miss Potty."
Patchy says: "I remember the first time we met."
Patchy says: "If I could only hear his voice."
Potty says: "Less talking and more working."
Patchy says: "Potty!"
Patchy says: "You came back to apologize."
Potty says: "I came to tell you to get back to work!"
Patchy says: "Hey, you can't tell me what to do you..."
Patchy says: "Huh?"
Patchy says: "Assistant manager?!"
Patchy says: "!"
Patchy says: "?"
Patchy says: "How did you become assistant manager?"
Potty says: "Oh, a little thing called the G."
Potty says: "E."
Potty says: "D."
Potty says: ", my man."
Patchy says: "Oh, here we go again with the fancy book-learnin'."
Patchy says: "Customers love me cookin'."
Patchy says: "Why, we're almost out of doggie bags."
The customer's face turns green and throws up the food into a doggy bag.
Patchy says: "Oh, Potty, what am I doing wrong?"
Potty says: "You just need some practice, that's all."
Patchy flips burgers and stuff, then we see Patchy looking through a microscope. He sees mini burger bacteria cells, then he laughs and coughs.
Patchy says: "Ahh, me patty's done."
Potty says: "Smells like an unswabbed poop deck."
Patchy says: "Oh, fine, I'll try it, then!"
Patchy says: "Ha!"
Patchy says: "Oh, well, I bet SpongeBob's first patty didn't go so well either."
Potty says: "Brawk, roll film."
Potty says: "A perfect patty on the first try."
Patchy says: "Oooooh, I'll make a Potty Patty out of you!"
Potty says: "You're unsanitary, Patchy."
Potty says: "You keep raw hamburger meat in an old boot!"
Patchy says: "Well, that's what gives it its special flavor."
Potty says: "You've got rats in the kitchen!"
Patchy says: "Oh, I brush and shampoo them daily."
Patchy says: "Who's Patchy's little princess?"
Patchy says: "Ow!"
Patchy says: "Mmmm!"
Patchy says: "Don't do that!"
Potty says: "And you should wash your hands after using the bathroom."
Patchy says: "What?"
Patchy says: "Every time?"
Potty says: "That's not all!"
Potty says: "This is a step in the right direction."
Patchy says: "What kind of a pirate wears a hairnet?"
Potty says: "The same kind who wears a "Kiss the Cook" apron."
Patchy says: "Well, you'll never know, Potty."
Patchy says: "I might get lucky."
Patchy says: "You hear that, ladies?"
Patchy says: "Patchy's available."
Patchy says: "Huh?"
Potty says: "Now I feel sick."
Patchy says: "That's it, you feathered snake!"
Patchy says: "This time you gone too far!"
Patchy starts flipping patties at Potty.
Potty says: "Brawk, you missed!"
Potty says: "Squawk!"
Potty says: "Is that all you got?"
Potty says: "Now you've done it."
Mr. Pirateson says: "Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!"
Patchy says: "Yes, Mr."
Patchy says: "Pirateson."
Patchy says: "You kids watch the rest of the cartoon, while I watch Potty get fired."
Mr. Pirateson says: "Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!"
Patchy says: "Coming, Mr."
Patchy says: "Pirateson, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "So we went back to our secret hideaway, the dump, to prove to those chowder heads that a burger could be semi-edible and easy to swallow."
Mr. Krabs says: "We made sure to keep careful record of our progress."
Plankton says: "Gently."
Plankton says: "Gently."
Mr. Krabs says: "We finally emerged with the best-looking burger under the sea."
Mr. Krabs says: "We went back to Stinky's to rub our patty in those kids' greasy faces."
Mr. Krabs says: "But Stinky's had been shut down by order of the Health Department."
Mr. Krabs says: "So we seized the opportunity and converted our hideout into a restaurant."
Plankton says: "There you are, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "'Twas me first dollar I ever earned, and 'twas also the start of a beautiful, romantic relationship with money."
Fish Kid says: "Hey!"
Fish Kid says: "Your burgers are even worse than Stinky's."
Fish Kid says: "We can barely keep them down."
Fish Kid says: "And if it weren't for Stinky's shutting down, no one would eat here."
Fish Kid says: "So give me a burger."
Fish Kid says: "I'm starving."
Plankton says: "Just look at them, Eugene."
Plankton says: "The very people who ridiculed me are now feasting on my recipe."
Mr. Krabs says: "I thought it was our recipe."
Plankton says: "I'm ruling their stomachs."
Plankton says: "And soon I'll be ruling their minds!"
Mr. Krabs says: "But what about satisfying the customer?"
Plankton says: "Barnacles to the customer, I'm talking about ruling the world!"
Plankton says: "And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Give me that!"
Plankton says: "Stop!"
Plankton says: "You're gonna bust it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Burgers aren't for ruling worlds!"
Plankton says: "I'm terribly sorry, Eugene, I couldn't hear you."
Plankton says: "Could you come closer?"
Plankton says: "Maybe stand on the tile in front of you?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Which one?"
Mr. Krabs says: "The one that says "Eject" or the one that says "Trap Door"?"
Plankton says: "Oh, either one will do."
Mr. Krabs says: "What I was saying was..."
Mr. Krabs says: "And he always did."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hold on there, me boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "We don't need to go through that again."
Plankton says: "Very touching, but completely false."
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't know what you mean."
Plankton says: "Why don't you tell them the truth?"
SpongeBob says: "It did happen that way, didn't it, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Plankton says: "Most of it's true, except for what really happened!"
Plankton says: "We had created the tastiest burger."
Plankton says: "That's when things became unsavory."
Mr. Krabs says: "First, I'll rule their stomachs and then..."
Plankton says: "But what about satisfying the customers?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Barnacles to the customers!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm talkin' about coins, cash, wallets, bank accounts!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!"
Plankton says: "Gimme that!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Stop, you're gonna bust it."
Plankton says: "This isn't about money, Eugene."
Mr. Krabs says: "Malarkey."
Plankton says: "YOU'LL REGRET THIS ONE DAY!!"
Plankton says: "Our little squabble only got me part of the recipe."
SpongeBob says: "Gosh, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Plankton, that doesn't sound like the Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs story at all."
Karen says: "That's because it isn't."
SpongeBob says: "KAREN?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "KAREN?!"
 says: "KAREN?!"
Plankton says: "KAREN?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
 says: "!"
Plankton says: "!"
Karen says: "You're both liars."
Karen says: "That's not how it happened at all."
Karen says: "In those days, I was just starting out as a security system."
Karen says: "Plankton and I met when he installed me."
Plankton says: "It was only our third date."
Karen says: "Anyways, I had recorded the whole thing in my databanks."
Plankton says: "Now that's a handsome looking burger."
Mr. Krabs says: "You said it, old chum."
Plankton says: "What's that music?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'd know that theme song anywhere."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's Old Man Jenkins."
Mr. Krabs says: "Old Man Jenkins!"
Old Man Jenkins says: "I just been searching for some new shoes for Ol' Bessie."
Mr. Krabs says: "You've helped me mom and me through some tough times."
Mr. Krabs says: "It would be an honor if you'd be the first to try our delicious burgers."
Old Man Jenkins says: "Why, I'd be happy to!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah!"
Plankton says: "Yeah!"
Mr. Krabs says: ""Plab Patties KO Old Man J"."
Mr. Krabs says: "I can't believe we poisoned that sweet old guy."
Plankton says: "Well, he is old."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey."
Mr. Krabs says: "That guy is like family to me."
Plankton says: "Well, it was your fault the patty was tainted."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in the burger."
Plankton says: "You let it sit out too long."
Plankton says: "That's what did it!"
Plankton says: "I'm taking the recipe and fixing it."
Mr. Krabs says: "No way, that recipe's mine!"
Plankton says: "Stop, you're gonna..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, that's ruined."
Mr. Krabs says: "But, no use letting this go to waste."
Mr. Krabs says: "These kids'll eat anything."
Mr. Krabs says: "I've done it."
Mr. Krabs says: "I've discovered the perfect patty batter."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, no you don't!"
Mr. Krabs says: "This is my turf."
Plankton says: "I think not, Rag Boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why I oughta squash you right now!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You little..."
Plankton says: "Get out of my face!"
Bully #3 says: "Hey, look!"
Bully #3 says: "Nerd fight."
Billy says: "I bet five bucks on Rag Boy."
Plankton says: "Aha!"
Plankton says: "We'll let the customers decide whose burger is better."
Plankton says: "Step right up, gents."
Plankton says: "Get a delicious Chum Burger right here."
Billy says: "Big Johnny will eat anything."
Plankton says: "Have a Chum Burger, Johnny, sir."
Karen says: "Plankton had pieced together his own creation using memory and science."
Plankton says: "Go on, sir!"
Plankton says: "Tell your buddies what you think!"
Billy says: "I'm gonna try one of Rag Boy's burgers."
Mr. Krabs says: "Here ya are, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "You are the first to taste a Krabby Patty."
Billy says: "Flavor!"
Bully #5 says: "Edible!"
Bullies #2 says: "We can actually hold it down!"
#6 says: "We can actually hold it down!"
Abigail-Marge says: "This is the most flavortastic sensation my still-developing taste buds have ever experienced!"
All says: "Yay, Rag Boy!"
Plankton says: "I'll show you, Krabs!"
Plankton says: "I'll steal that cursed recipe from you one day, and I won't stop 'til I do!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Woo-hoo!"
Mr. Krabs says: "My recipe was, is, and always will be the best!"
Plankton says: "You wouldn't have that recipe if it weren't for me!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You callin' me a liar?"
Karen says: "Will you men stop yelling at each other?"
Karen says: "I can't believe you let a recipe ruin such a wonderful friendship!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You were my only true friend that didn't have a president printed on him."
Mr. Krabs says: "But money doesn't hug back."
Plankton says: "My life has been nothing but a long line of disappointments since we became enemies."
Plankton says: "All these years I've been trying to steal your formula."
Plankton says: "But I was really just trying to steal back our friendship."
Mr. Krabs says: "Really?"
Plankton says: "It's all I ever really wanted."
Plankton says: "To get back to the way it used to be."
Plankton says: "You and me against the world!"
Plankton says: "How about a hug, Krabs, old pal?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'd like that, Planky, old chum."
SpongeBob says: "Doesn't it just warm your heart, Karen?"
Karen says: "I suppose it would."
Karen says: "If I had one."
Plankton says: "I'm sorry, Krabs, old buddy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Me, too."
Mr. Krabs says: "Me, too."
Plankton says: "Now, Karen!"
SpongeBob says: "Sabotage!"
Plankton says: "Go, Karen!"
Patchy says: "Ohh, that Plankton never learns, does he, kids?"
Patchy says: "As for me, I decided to take some time off to catch up on me reading."
Potty says: "Hey, you didn't take time off, you got fired!"
Patchy says: "Hey, you got fired, too!"
Potty says: "I got a golden parachute."
A golden parachute appears on Potty's strings. The inside of the restaurant glows.
Patchy says: "Well, at least I know they'll never ever be able to replace me."
Potty says: "Looks like they already did."
Patchy gasps when he sees a gorilla.
Patchy says: "WHAT?!"
Patchy says: "!"
Patchy says: "?"
Patchy says: "They let a smelly, hairy fleabag like that serve food?!"
Patchy says: "!"
Patchy says: "?"
Gorilla says: "Ohhhhhhhhh!"
Gorilla says: "Ohhhhhhhhh!"
Gorilla says: "Ohhhhhhhhh!"
Gorilla says: "Ohhhhhhhhh!"
Patchy says: "Hey, watch it, ape!"
Gorilla throws some food ingredients at Patchy.
Patchy says: "Watch the patch!"
Patchy says: "Ow!"
Patchy says: "Ow!"
Patchy says: "No!"
Patchy says: "Please!"
Gorilla says: "Ohhhhhhhhh!"
Gorilla says: "Ohhhhhhh..."
Gorilla says: "!"
Patchy says: "Ooh!"
Patchy says: "I have a tomato allergy!"
Patchy says: "Ow, right in the buns!"
Narrator says: "And so, kids, always remember to follow your dreams."
Narrator says: "Unless you're Patchy, then just stay in bed."
