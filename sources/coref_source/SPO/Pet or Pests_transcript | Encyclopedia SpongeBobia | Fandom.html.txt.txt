Patrick says: "Nice landing!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, maybe we should play something that involves less thinking."
Patrick says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "Hey!"
SpongeBob says: "Maybe we can play a game with this ball that was buried under here!"
Patrick says: "Ball!"
Patrick says: "Let me see it!"
Patrick says: "What a weird ball."
SpongeBob says: "Well, who knows how long it..."
SpongeBob says: "Ah!"

Patrick says: "See?"
SpongeBob says: "You're right, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry we destroyed your nest, little worm."
SpongeBob says: "I promise it won't happen again."

Mrs. Wormley and Gary are growling at each other again.

SpongeBob says: "Well, these things take time."
Gary and Mrs. Wormsley get into a fight.
SpongeBob says: "Duck and cover!"
Patrick says: "Duck and cover!"
Patrick says: "This town is getting too rough for me."
Until outside of conch street.
Gary says: "Meow, meow, meow."
Mrs. Wormsley is now riding a bus.
SpongeBob says: "He's chased her away!"
SpongeBob says: "Now who will care for her abandoned litter of adorable newborn infants?"
Patrick says: "Well, maybe you could take care of them."
SpongeBob says: "I dunno, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I've never seen Gary that upset."
Patrick says: "Ga..."
Patrick says: "who?"
SpongeBob says: "Nope, you and I are just gonna have to find loving homes for each and every one of these little guys."
SpongeBob says: "Right, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, little guys."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward is a really good friend of mine, and he really likes pets."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, what are you doing here?"
Squidward says: "Don't you know that it's 7:00 in the morning?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, I came over with a very special surprise."
Squidward says: "Don't you know that it's 7:00 in the morning?"
SpongeBob says: "How would you like to have your very own pet baby worms?"
Squidward says: "Don't you know that it's 7:00 in the—"

SpongeBob says: "Have a nice day!"
Mrs. Puff says: "I hate Mondays."
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, little worms."
SpongeBob says: "I know a place where we can find go to find homes for every single one of you."
SpongeBob says: "That whistling."
SpongeBob says: "It's Larry Lobster!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Larry, what are you up to?"
Larry says: "Do I know you?"
SpongeBob says: "Probably not."
Larry says: "I was just picking up some dietary supplements here at the supermarket."

SpongeBob says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "I was just gonna see if you wanted one of these poor, lonely baby worms."
Larry says: "Baby worms?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, yeah!"
Larry says: "I'll take them off your hands."
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
Larry says: "Sure, why not?"
Larry says: "That's just what the nutritionist ordered: raw protein!"
SpongeBob says: "Larry, no!"
Larry says: "Dude, nice hustle."
The box lands in the middle of an intersection, with an 18-wheeler headed straight for it. SpongeBob lets out a bloodcurdling scream, flails his arms and babbles incoherently. Larry launches SpongeBob into the air with his abs and he lands on the hood of the truck. He slides down, pulls the vent apart, and crawls inside. He pulls out three plugs, then peeks outside. The truck is still going. Then he notices a loose screw. He unscrews it completely with a wrench, causing the engine to fall out of the bottom of the truck and the truck to stop completely, in the nick of time.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, little wormies, I'm so glad you're safe."
SpongeBob says: "Now let's go see about finding you those homes I promised."
SpongeBob says: "Hello?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, it's Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "I've been looking all over for you."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're three hours late for work!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hello?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, are you sure you're feeling shipshape?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "My pet worm had babies and got chased away."
SpongeBob says: "Now I've got to find them all a place to live."
Mr. Krabs says: "Babies?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
Mr. Krabs says: "Let me see."
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, come on, let me see them."
Mr. Krabs says: "I like babies."
SpongeBob says: "Well, okay."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, he likes you."
Garbage Fish #1 says: "Hmm..."
Garbage Fish #2 says: "What is it?"
Garbage Fish #1 says: "I'd recognize this goo anywhere."
Garbage Fish #1 says: "It comes from a baby spotted glistening meadow worm, the rarest of its species."
Garbage Fish #2 says: "Dude, those things are worth a fortune."
Mr. Krabs says: "Did you say "fortune?"
Mr. Krabs says: ""  $5."
Mr. Krabs says: "99, that's right."
Mr. Krabs says: "Get them while they last."
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't be shy, folks."
Female fish says: "These things are so cute!"
SpongeBob says: "Enjoy your new home, little guy."
Female fish says: "Isn't he just adorable?"
SpongeBob says: "That sure was a great idea you had, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, it's like they always say back in the old country, lad."
SpongeBob says: "What's that?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't know."
Mr. Krabs says: "I've never been to the old country!"
