A humanized pink starfish in a suit walks up and knocks on Patrick's rock.
Patrick says: "Yeah?"
Starfish says: "Good day, sir."
Starfish says: "I am..."
SpongeBob says: "Ah, there's nothing like spending quality time with my Gare-Gare."
Lady on TV says: "Jason, I have to be honest."
Lady on TV says: "There's someone else."
Man on TV says: "Grandpa!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what are you doing?"
Patrick says: "I have to get rid of these books!"
SpongeBob says: "Why?"
Patrick says: "I'll show you why."
Patrick says: "Uh-huh."
Patrick says: "Which means I'm gonna get thrown into the big house."
Patrick says: "And you know what that means..."
SpongeBob says: "Small portion meals?"
Patrick says: "Exactly!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, don't you worry."
SpongeBob says: "I got your back, man."
SpongeBob says: "Hi there."
Starfish says: "Salutations, young one."
Starfish says: "Say, you wouldn't happen to know that starfish that lives under this rock, would you?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "No, I don't know any starfish."
SpongeBob says: "Even if I did know this "alleged" starfish, Patrick wouldn't owe any overdue library books."
Patrick says: "This is the worst-tasting gift ever!"
Starfish says: "That's because you're suppose to wear it, not eat it."
Starfish says: "Allow me to show you something."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, Patrick, that's great!"
Patrick says: "What is?"
SpongeBob says: "That you're king!"
Patrick says: "What's a king?"
SpongeBob says: "When you're a king, you can get anything you want."
Patrick says: "Anything I want?"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, do you think we can get something to eat?"
SpongeBob says: "Your wish is my command, your majesty."
Patrick says: "King needs food badly."
Mr. Krabs says: "What's this all ab..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, well, well."
Mr. Krabs says: "What can I do for you, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "The king would like..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Zip it, SquarePants..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm talking to the rich guy."
Patrick says: "I'll have ten Krabby Patties, a Krabby milkshake, large fries..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I've got a better idea."
Mr. Krabs says: "A buffet fit for a king."
Patrick says: "Tasty."
Mr. Krabs says: "Listen, Patrick, there comes a time in every man's life when he's got to settle down."
Mr. Krabs says: "You know, get a wife, kids, a father-in-law you give all your money to."
Patrick says: "Uh-huh, that sounds great."
Patrick says: "Hey, can I get a little more ketchup?"
Mr. Krabs says: "How about you pay the check, instead?"
Patrick says: "Oh, sorry, Mr Krabs, no can do."
Patrick says: "As king of Bikini Bottom, I am allowed to have anything I want."
Patrick says: "Isn't that right, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "That is correct."
SpongeBob says: "Anything you want, and it's all free."
Mr. Krabs says: "All free?!!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!!"
Mr. Krabs says: "?"
Patrick says: "Are you gonna eat that?"
Harold says: "I was planning to, why?"
Patrick says: "I want it."
Harold says: "Hey!"
Harold says: "What gives you the right to take my food?"
Patrick says: "Tell him, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, Pat, I'm not sure this is what being king is all about."
Patrick says: "I thought you said I could have anything I want."
Patrick says: "Was my bestest friend lying to me?"
SpongeBob says: "Don't be ridiculous, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I'd never lie to you."
Patrick says: "Good!"
Patrick says: "Now tell him."
SpongeBob says: "Hi."
SpongeBob says: "By proclamation of the Royal Ministry, the king is entitled to get whatever he wants."
Harold says: "This isn't fair."
Patrick says: "Life isn't fair, pal."
Patrick says: "Get used to it."
Fish says: "I finally did it!"
Fish says: "At long last, I've acquired issue #2 of Wonder Space Fish, and in mint condition."
Fish says: "Now my 40 year-old life and my comic book collection are complete."
Fish says: "Mom's gonna be so proud of me."
Patrick says: "No, she won't be, because these comic books are mine!"
Fish says: "But, I've spent my entire life collecting those."
Patrick says: "Yeah, well, now you can spend the rest of your life crying about it."
Patrick says: "I'm the king!"
Fish says: "I will cry about it."
Patrick says: "I love being king."
Cut to the jewelery store where the owner is examining a diamond. SpongeBob then shows him the decree and he gives it to Patrick, who puts it in his belly button. Then, SpongeBob takes some lollipops from some kids and Patrick starts licking them. Then SpongeBob shows the decree to Martha Smith, who sadly gives her baby to Patrick, who then takes out the baby's pacifier and gives the wailing baby back to her. Then Patrick takes a plunger, a toaster, and dentures. Soon, a long line of people are standing with things to give to Patrick in front of his rock, which now has a castle tower fixed to it.
SpongeBob says: "Ok, thank you, sir."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sure King Patrick could use this walker."

Squidward says: "Ferris Wheel?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I know, isn't it great?"
Squidward says: "No, it's not great!"
Squidward says: "It's horrible!"
Squidward says: "Oh, that's it!"
Squidward says: "Stop!"
Squidward says: "People of Bikini Bottom, stop!"
Squidward says: "Stop!"
Squidward says: "Patrick's no king."
Squidward says: "Look at him."

SpongeBob says: "Gary, you're royalty!"
Gary says: "Meow?"
