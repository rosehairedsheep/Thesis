The Krusty Krab at night. The lights are still on.
Mr. Krabs says: "Come on, SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's quittin' time!"
SpongeBob says: "Who're you playing cards with, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm going over to the Chum Bucket to play with Plankton."
Plankton says: "Ouch."
SpongeBob says: "Why would you play cards with him?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Between you and me, Plankton is the worst card player in Bikini Bottom!"
SpongeBob says: "Taking him to the cleaners!"
SpongeBob says: "That's a hot one!"
SpongeBob says: "How'd the card game go last night, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I lost."
SpongeBob says: "Barnacles, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "How much money did you lose?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I didn't lose any money."
Mr. Krabs says: "I lost..."
SpongeBob says: "Don't tell me you lost the Krusty Krab!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I lost..."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, please tell me you didn't lose the Krabby Patty secret formula!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I lost..."
Mr. Krabs says: "you!"
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I bet your contract and I lost."
SpongeBob says: "Good one, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I got to go make those Krabby Patties."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm afraid you don't work here anymore."
Squidward says: "Please tell me this isn't a joke."
SpongeBob says: "Go on, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Tell him."
SpongeBob says: "Tell him all about your cruel, sick joke."
Plankton says: "As much as I love cruel, sick jokes, I'm afraid he's not joking."
SpongeBob says: "But, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I don't wanna work for him!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm sorry, boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's all my fault!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Plankton says: "This is your greatest blunder, Krabs."
Plankton says: "For fifteen years, I've been throwing those card games just waiting for you to slip up."
Plankton says: "I may not have the precious Krabby Patty formula, but I've got the next best thing: the guy who makes 'em!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "What is this place?"
Plankton says: "Okay, I'm ready for my Krabby Patty!"
SpongeBob says: "Actually, uh, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Plankton, sir, I haven't, uh..."
Plankton says: "Perhaps you don't understand."
SpongeBob says: "The sign says "kitchen", but my heart says "jail"."
SpongeBob says: "♪A stove is a stove, no matter where you go."
Mr. Krabs says: "♪A patty is a patty, that's what I say."
Mr. Krabs says: "♪And fries should be fries, either way."
SpongeBob says: "♪But this grill is not a home."
SpongeBob says: "This is not the stove I know."
Mr. Krabs says: "♪I would trade it all away, if you'd come back to stay."
Unison says: "♪This kitchen's not the same without you."
SpongeBob says: "♪It's just a greasy spoon..."
Unison says: "♪..."
Unison says: "without you."
Plankton says: "What is he doing?"
Plankton says: "All these tears..."
Plankton says: "and the showtunes..."
Plankton says: "Why isn't he making the patties?"
Plankton says: "Forget it."
Plankton says: "I'm going with plan B, I'll put his brain in the robot chef."
Karen says: "You know that never works!"
Karen says: "The answer is obvious: to get to the SpongeBob, you must show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give you what you want."
Plankton says: "Will you be quiet?"
Plankton says: "I'm thinking!"
Plankton says: "I've got it!"
Plankton says: "To get to the SpongeBob, I'll show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give me what I want."
We see SpongeBob struggling to make a Krabby Patty with one of Plankton's cooking machines.
Plankton says: "Hi!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Plankton, I've tried my best."
SpongeBob says: "I'm not used to cooking this way!"
SpongeBob says: "Please don't take my brain out!"
Plankton says: "Hold it, SpongeBob, I'm capable of compassion and understanding."
SpongeBob says: "Really?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Then I would like to go back to the Krusty Krab."
Plankton says: "Let's not get carried away."
Plankton says: "Now what can I do to make you more comfortable here at the Chum Bucket?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I usually cook on a grill."
Plankton says: "You got it!"
Plankton says: "Well, it wasn't easy, but here it is!"
Plankton says: "One old frying grill."
Plankton says: "How about we try it out?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, it's just that I'm used to the grill facing that way."
Plankton says: "Say no more, I'll take care of everything."
Plankton says: "How about here?"
SpongeBob says: "A little more to the left."
Plankton says: "How's this, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Move it over a little more."
Plankton says: "Here?"
SpongeBob says: "Keep going."
Plankton says: "Here?"
SpongeBob says: "Almost!"
SpongeBob says: "That's it, just a little more..."
SpongeBob says: "perfect!"
SpongeBob says: "Right there!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know, it still doesn't feel right."
Plankton says: "It's an exact replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen!"
SpongeBob says: "It is an exact replica!"
SpongeBob says: "Here's the sink, the greasy fryers, the squeaky floorboards, and that thing!"
SpongeBob says: "One Krabby Patty coming up, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh..."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Plankton says: "Don't cry, SpongeBob!"
Plankton says: "I'll show you it's much better working for me!"
Plankton says: "Is there anything that old skinflint Krabs wouldn't let you have?"
SpongeBob says: "Well..."
SpongeBob says: "there is one thing I've always wanted..."
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
Plankton says: "So now do you have everything you need to make some Krabby Patties?"
SpongeBob says: "Well..."
Plankton says: "You ready to make some patties?"
SpongeBob says: "Wait ‘til I finish my ice cream!"
Plankton says: "How about those patties?"
SpongeBob says: "Faster!"
SpongeBob says: "Faster!"
SpongeBob says: "Faster!"
Plankton says: "And then the littlest sea-elf said..."
Plankton says: "Huh?"
Plankton says: "Steady, Plankton!"
Plankton says: "It's all gonna pay off soon enough."
Plankton says: "Hey there, sleepy head, what do you say?"
SpongeBob says: "All this preparation is making me hungry."
Plankton says: "Me too."
Plankton says: "You know what would really hit the spot?"
Plankton says: "Why don't you whip us up a couple of Krabby Patties?"
SpongeBob says: "Mmmm..."
SpongeBob says: "I'm kind of in the mood for tacos."
Plankton says: "Good one, SpongeBob."
Plankton says: "But really, why don't you go ahead and make us a patty?"
SpongeBob says: "No, I don't really feel like it!"
Plankton says: "But I don't understand."
Plankton says: "I rubbed your putrid feet!"
SpongeBob says: "Tell you what, half-pint: why don't you ask me later?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Plankton says: "I command you to make me a patty this instant!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Plankton says: "Don't back sass me!"
SpongeBob says: "Do ba da ma!"
Plankton says: "What?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Plankton says: "You shouldn't have been a spoiled brat."
Plankton says: "You see, I always get what I want."
Plankton says: "And I want you to make me a Krabby Patty!"
Robot SpongeBob says: "Dee-dee-doodle-dee-dee-doo."
Robot SpongeBob says: "Response: Why don't you ask me later?"
Plankton says: "What?"
Plankton says: "WHAT?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Robot SpongeBob says: "Get welded."
Plankton says: "Wait!"
Plankton says: "I command you make me a Krabby Patty!"
Robot SpongeBob says: "I don't wanna."
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
Plankton says: "I can't take anymore."
Plankton says: "You've gotta take that yellow nightmare back!"
Plankton says: "It's not worth it."
Plankton says: "I'm better off stealing a Krabby Patty fair and square."
Mr. Krabs says: "Um..."
Mr. Krabs says: "well..."
Mr. Krabs says: "a deal's a deal, Plankton."
Mr. Krabs says: "He's your headache now."
Plankton says: "Oh, please, have mercy, Krabs!"
Plankton says: "I'll do anything!"
Plankton says: "I beg of you!"
Mr. Krabs says: "How 'bout..."
Mr. Krabs says: "you give me fifty bucks, and I'll take him off your hands."
Plankton says: "It's a deal!"
Plankton says: "I cheated anyway."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, be gone with you, you puny pest!"
Plankton says: "Thank you!"
Plankton says: "Ouch."
SpongeBob says: "My brain and I are glad to be back, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Glad to have you back, lad."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now get to those patties!"
Mr. Krabs says: "The lunch rush is a-comin'!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's what I thought you said."
