Patrick wakes up grunting and moaning with lots of drool all over his mouth.
Patrick says: "Wha..."
Patrick says: "?"
Patrick says: "What happened?"
Patrick says: "Where am I!"
Patrick says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Would you like another spot of tea, Ms."
SpongeBob says: "Nibsy?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, you would?"
Patrick says: "Whooooo!"
Patrick says: "Chamomile, chamomile, chamomile!"
Patrick says: "Oh, she really knows how to pound 'em down, huh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "A donut this nice could really make a guy happy!"
Back to present time, Patrick gasps and opens his rock to check on SpongeBobâ€™s house. He goes back to the table.
Patrick says: "This is SpongeBob's delicious..."
Devil Donut says: "Go on and eat it."
Devil Donut says: "What are you waitin' for?"
Angel Donut says: "Don't do it!"
Angel Donut says: "It's SpongeBob's donut!"
Devil Donut says: "Don't listen to him, he's covered with sprinkles."
Patrick says: "..."
Patrick says: "I hate conflicts!"
Devil Donut says: "It couldn't get any easier than this."
Devil Donut says: "Just hook a chain to it,  pop it in your mouth, and then when your sponge friend wants it back, just yank it out."
Angel Donut says: "I hate to admit it, but that's a great idea!"
Patrick says: "Hello..."
Patrick says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Star."
SpongeBob says: "It's SquarePants."
SpongeBob says: "That was some party last night, huh, buddy?"
SpongeBob says: "That's exactly how I feel about it."
SpongeBob says: "Luckily, I videotaped the whole party so we can relive it over and over and over again."
Patrick says: "Ah, don't watch that tape.."
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm waiting to watch it with you, Sillyfish!"
SpongeBob says: "I'll be right over."
SpongeBob says: "Sheesh, Patrick's so excited, I better not keep him waiting!"
Patrick says: "Oh, no..."
Patrick says: "that video will show me stealing SpongeBob's donut.."
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, eee, eee!"
Patrick says: "I gotta hide this thing."
Patrick says: "Ow, hot, hot, hot, ow!"
SpongeBob says: "Get out of the way, Patrick, I gotta go!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Ah!"
Patrick says: "H-hey, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "I don't have anything behind my back, so don't look there!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay..."
SpongeBob says: "No problem."
SpongeBob says: "Ready to see this?"
Patrick says: "No!"
Patrick says: "I took it, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "I took your donut..."
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "I'm sorry!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "You really need to see this video!"
Patrick says: "This is mine?"
SpongeBob says: "Of course!"
SpongeBob says: "It was your birthday."
Patrick says: "When?"
SpongeBob says: "Last night, silly!"
Patrick says: "Hey, Wanna share it?"
SpongeBob says: "Sure, pal!"
Patrick says: "Yeah, pretty good, huh?"
