Mr. Krabs says: "We need a gimmick that's nothing short of a masterpiece."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I know!"
SpongeBob says: "Win a date with Squidward Tuesdays!"
Squidward says: "Oh, for dolphins sakes!"

SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs doesn't think my ideas are helping."
Squidward says: "Shocking."
SpongeBob says: "I just want to help him find the perfect Krabby Patty gimmick."

Squidward says: "It's the work of Fiasco the artist!"
Squidward says: "He was featured in last month's Art Wonk magazine!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Heh, you call this art?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Looks like a swappy's footlocker."
Squidward says: "It all makes sense now!"
Squidward says: "The dark denim, the dismal statements, the extensive use of red and yellow!"
Squidward says: "This is directly out of his early abstract experiments!"

Mr. Krabs says: "I'll take a million for it."
Squidward says: "It's not yours to sell!"
Squidward says: "I found it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Me plate, me buns, me mustard,  me Fiasco."

Mr. Krabs says: "Gotta protect me valuable property."
Farfel Bainbridge says: "Well, technically, it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to the people of Bikini Bottom."
Farfel Bainbridge says: "Unfortunately, they'll have to set foot in this grease-trap to get a look at this great piece of art."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, so now you're a restaurant critic."

Plankton says: "It's so bizarre!"
Plankton says: "Normally, when I steal something from the Krusty Krab, it's Krabs who chases me not a bunch of cops."
Plankton says: "So if you know what's going on, start talking or else you're gonna answer with the spoon, see!"
SpongeBob says: "I-I can explain."
SpongeBob says: "That partially eaten Krabby Patty isn't just garbage, it's a work of art."
