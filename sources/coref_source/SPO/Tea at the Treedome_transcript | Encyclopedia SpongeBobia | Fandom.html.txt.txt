Sandra "Sandy" Jennifer Cheeks says: "Take that, you sorry old clam!"
Sandra "Sandy" Jennifer Cheeks says: "Y'all need to learn some manners!"
Sandra "Sandy" Jennifer Cheeks says: "You're about as ugly as homemade soup."
SpongeBob says: "Hooray, land squirrel!"
SpongeBob says: "Your shell is mine!"
SpongeBob pulls up his pants and starts to charge at the clam. He jumps into the clam's mouth and starts to strangle its tongue. SpongeBob sees that Sandy has already escaped and the clam swallows him now.
Sandy says: "Hold on there, little square dude!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, you like karate too."
SpongeBob says: "So, what's your name?"
Sandy says: "Sandy."
Sandy says: "So what do y'all call yourself?"
Sandy says: "Well, SpongeBob, take a gander at this."
SpongeBob says: "Oh."
Sandy says: "I like you, SpongeBob."

Sandy says: "Hi-yah!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, I like you too, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "Hi-yah!"
SpongeBob says: "Ow."
SpongeBob says: "Say, what is that thing on your head?"
Sandy says: "Why, that's my air helmet."
SpongeBob says: "May I try it on?"
Sandy says: "Heck no."
Sandy says: "I need it to breathe."
Sandy says: "I gotta have my air."
SpongeBob says: "Me too."
SpongeBob says: "I love air."
SpongeBob says: "Air is good."
Sandy says: "No kidding?"
SpongeBob says: "Why, "air" is my middle name."
SpongeBob says: "The more air, the better."
SpongeBob says: "Can't get enough of that air."
Sandy says: "Shee-oot."
Sandy says: "How about comin' over tomorrow for tea and cookies then?"
Sandy says: "Don't be late."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, see you tomorrow."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, Patrick, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "What's air?"
Patrick says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "I just met this girl."
SpongeBob says: "She wears a hat full of..."
SpongeBob says: "air."
Patrick says: "Do you mean she puts on "airs"?"
SpongeBob says: "I guess so."
Patrick says: "That's just fancy talk."
Patrick says: "If you wanna be fancy, hold your pinky up like this."
Patrick says: "The higher you hold it, the fancier you are."
SpongeBob says: "How's that?"
Patrick says: "Higher."
SpongeBob says: "Like that?"
Patrick says: "Now that's fancy."
Patrick says: "They should call you SpongeBob FancyPants."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, pal."
Sandy says: "Hello?"
SpongeBob says: "Hi-ya, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "It’s me, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "Hold on a sec, I'll let you in."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "here."
Sandy says: "‘Course there's no water."
Sandy says: "Nuttin' but air."
SpongeBob says: "No water?"
Sandy says: "That ain't a problem, is it?"
Sandy says: "Hi-yah!"
SpongeBob says: "Problem?"
SpongeBob says: "With no water."
Patrick says: "Pinky."
Patrick says: "Pinky."
SpongeBob says: "I brought you some flowers."
Sandy says: "You okay?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, I'm okay."
Sandy says: "You know, you're the first sea critter to ever visit."
SpongeBob says: "I can’t imagine why."
Sandy says: "Can I get you anything?"
SpongeBob says: "Water would be nice."
Sandy says: "I'm gonna to put these in a vase."
SpongeBob says: "Take your time."
Sandy says: "I like you, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "We could be tighter than bark on a tree."
SpongeBob struggles even more.
Patrick says: "When in doubt, pinky out."
Sandy says: "Why, these flowers are just beautiful!"
Sandy says: "Be right back."
Patrick says: "No, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "No, no, no, stop!"
Patrick says: "Pinky!"
Patrick says: "Pinky!"
Patrick says: "You can't leave now."
Patrick says: "You'll blow it."
SpongeBob says: "Air is not good, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Air is not good."
Patrick says: "There's no water in here!"
SpongeBob says: "I tried to tell you!"
Patrick says: "We've gotta get out of here!"
SpongeBob says: "You're..."
SpongeBob says: "doing it..."
SpongeBob says: "wrong..."
Patrick says: "Wait, no!"
Patrick says: "We've got..."
Patrick says: "to get..."
Patrick says: "out."
Sandy says: "Come and get it!"
Sandy says: "Y'all gonna like this..."
She screams and drops her tray. On the grass is a live-action sponge and starfish. Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick leaning against a ladder with two goldfish helmets on. Sandy, on top of the ladder, uses a hose to fill those helmets with water.
Sandy says: "There, that oughta do it!"
Sandy says: "If y'all needed water, you shoulda asked."
All says: "Ahhh..."
