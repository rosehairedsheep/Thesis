At the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is in the bathroom, looking at a filthy sink mirror.
SpongeBob says: "You're nothing!"
SpongeBob says: "Is all that grime meant to scare me, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Mirror?"
SpongeBob says: "I've met sardines tougher than you are."
SpongeBob says: "Time to put you in your place."
SpongeBob says: "Now to attack these floors!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Are you kidding?"
Mr. Krabs says: "He's an absolute treasure to have around the restaurant!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And he's been with me for such a long time now."
SpongeBob says: "I am."
Mr. Krabs says: "But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to let the little guy go today."
SpongeBob says: "Yep, he's gonna have to--   Phew!"
SpongeBob says: "I am taller."
SpongeBob says: "You're the little guy, Squidsy!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Squidward looked taller there for a second."
SpongeBob says: "Better get a more accurate measurement."
Squidward says: "What do you think you're doing?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, just seeing which one of us is the little guy..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "and it looks like it is you!"
Squidward says: "No, I'm not!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, wait!"
Squidward says: "I don't care!"
Squidward says: "Now get back in the kitchen!"
SpongeBob says: "You'll care when you find out what's gonna happen to the little guy."
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
SpongeBob says: "And that Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs is letting me go today."
Mr. Krabs says: "Go on, little guy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Fly away."
Mr. Krabs says: "You'll be missed."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, what's the use, Gary?"
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Oh, sorry to interrupt your fit of self-loathing, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "I'm just borrowing your refrigerator again."
SpongeBob says: "What happened to yours?"
Patrick says: "Nothing, it's just empty."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, get it out of my sight!"
SpongeBob says: "Now that I have no means of purchasing food for myself, I do not need a refrigerator."
Patrick says: "Oh, don't get down on yourself, buddy."
Patrick says: "You can still purchase food for me."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, no, I can't, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I lost my job today."
SpongeBob says: "I won't be able to buy food for you,  or for anybody!"
Patrick says: "Oh, no!"
Patrick says: "What are you gonna do?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know!"
SpongeBob says: "I've been a fry cook for so long I..."
SpongeBob says: "I don't think I can do anything else."
SpongeBob says: "What do you think, boss?"
SpongeBob says: "I guess I'm not a carpenter, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "With a job that feels..."
SpongeBob says: "natural."
SpongeBob says: "Something that says, "This is a job for a sponge."
SpongeBob says: "" Any idea where I can find a job like that, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "No."
Patrick says: "Oh, but, yes!"
Patrick says: "It's so obvious!"
Patrick says: "You should work at the Krusty Krab."
Patrick says: "They need a fry cook!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "That's the job I got fired from, remember?"
Patrick says: "Ohhh."
Patrick says: "Mayhaps you should talk to the sponge behind you."
Patrick says: "He looks happy."
SpongeBob says: "That's just a billboard, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Why don't you get a job as a billboard?"
SpongeBob says: "I..."
SpongeBob says: "don't think that's physically possible,  but I could audition to be a sponge model."
Patrick says: "Fine, do it your way."
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "What a setup!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I don't know, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe this was a mistake."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe I don't have the talent."
Patrick says: "Oh, you have the talent."
Patrick says: "But do you have the natural ability?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, but..."
SpongeBob says: "wait, isn't that the same thing?"
Patrick says: "Why don't you find out?"
Patrick says: "No way!"
Patrick says: "It's too late for that now."
Patrick says: "Krabs doesn't need you anymore."
Patrick says: "This is your chance to prove you don't need him."
Patrick says: "Now get in there and earn me some groceries!"
Patrick says: "My friend here wants to audition for the sponge model role."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, well, want is a strong word."
SpongeBob says: "I'd like an audition, but if you've already cast it, that's fine if you cast it."
SpongeBob says: "I think she's already cast it."
SpongeBob says: "We'd better go, Patrick."
Casting Director says: "Hold it."
Casting Director says: "You want the audition, kid?"
Casting Director says: "You got it."
SpongeBob says: "I did?"
Casting Director says: "Show me what you got."
Casting Director says: "Okay, okay, okay!"
Casting Director says: "Let's get on with this train wreck."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, getting on it."
SpongeBob says: "â™ª When you dream upon a wish, you'll be heartened to know, that hope fills your dish, to the brim!"
Casting Director says: "All right, all right."
Casting Director says: "Thank you."
Casting Director says: "I've heard enough."
SpongeBob says: "How'd I do?"
Casting Director says: "Horribly."
Casting Director says: "I've seen clams with more talent than you."
SpongeBob says: "I guess a sponge can make it in this town."
News Reporter says: "I'm standing here with the new face of television, Mr."
News Reporter says: "SpongeBob SquarePants."
News Reporter says: "I'm sure the viewing audience would love to know, how does it feel to be the next big thing?"
SpongeBob says: "Fantastic."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "Did you say something?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yes, I did, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I said, "You're looking at the new face of television."
Patrick says: "All right!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I better go home and get some beauty sleep."
Patrick says: "Yeah, beauty sleep!"
SpongeBob says: "That's right."
SpongeBob says: "You are looking at a changed sponge."
SpongeBob says: "But don't worry."
SpongeBob says: "I won't forget all the people who held me on the way up."
Mr. Krabs says: "Afternoon, boy-o!"
SpongeBob says: "Ah, just as I was saying."
SpongeBob says: "I'd like to thank you for giving me my humble start."
SpongeBob says: "I won't forget you."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, when next you see me, it shall be on the television."
Casting Director says: "Oh, you're back!"
SpongeBob says: "A star's first day is his most important."
Casting Director says: "Great."
Casting Director says: "Let me see if they're ready on set."
Casting Director says: "Okay, you can go right in."
SpongeBob says: "Yippee!"
SpongeBob says: "I am ready for my close-up, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Director."
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
SpongeBob says: "What's happening?"
SpongeBob says: "Wh-wh-what's happening?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Director says: "In this scene, you'll be cleaning bathroom mixtures."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, so, uh, where's my cleaning utensil?"
Director says: "Action!"
SpongeBob says: "Noooo!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't do this!"
Director says: "Cut!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry."
SpongeBob says: "I don't think I'm cut out for acting."
Director says: "Was?"
Director says: "You said you were professional actor."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I'm not."
Director says: "Wait!"
Director says: "Wait!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ever so gently..."
SpongeBob says: "Please."
Mr. Krabs says: "Boy, what are you going on about?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I heard you on the phone saying you were gonna let the little guy go."
SpongeBob says: "But I don't wanna go!"
SpongeBob says: "Please don't let me go, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "You're looking at the little guy that doesn't want to go."
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, boy-o!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I won't get rid of ya: on one condition."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, boy!"
SpongeBob says: "This is the best job in the world!"
Hans says: "Hey, could you keep it down in there?"
Hans says: "I'm trying to concentrate."
