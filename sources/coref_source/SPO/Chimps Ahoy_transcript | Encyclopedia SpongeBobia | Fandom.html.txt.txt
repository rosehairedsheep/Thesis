SpongeBob and Patrick are standing in front of SpongeBob's house when the mailman comes walking by and puts a package into SpongeBob's mailbox.
SpongeBob says: "It's here!"
Patrick says: "It's here!"
SpongeBob says: "Behold, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "The official Goofy Goober Backscratcher!"
SpongeBob says: "And it only cost me 52 box tops."
Patrick says: "Wow."
SpongeBob says: "Ooh."
SpongeBob says: "Mm-hmm."
SpongeBob says: "Oh..."
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah, that's it!"
Patrick says: "Let me try!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, Patrick, that's not the backscratcher."
SpongeBob says: "That's my arm."
SpongeBob says: "You know, we shouldn't keep this all to ourselves."
SpongeBob says: "We should let Squidward try it out."
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Onward..."
SpongeBob says: "to Squidward's house."
Squidward says: "Go away!"
SpongeBob says: "To Sandy's house."
SpongeBob says: "What's wrong, Sandy?"
Sandy says: "They're coming."
Sandy says: "They're coming."
Sandy says: "The chimps are coming."
SpongeBob says: "Who?"
Sandy says: "My bosses."
Sandy says: "They're coming for an inspection."
Sandy says: "I've worked day and night for a week, but none of my inventions are any good."
Sandy says: "If I don't have a real impressive invention by this afternoon, they'll cut my funding, and I'll have to leave Bikini Bottom."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, come on, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "I'll bet you invented lots of useful things."
SpongeBob says: "This helmet looks impressive."
SpongeBob says: "What's it do?"
Sandy says: "It lets you talk to nuts."
Sandy says: "What use is that?"
Patrick says: "What's it saying?"
SpongeBob says: "It says..."
SpongeBob says: ""It's dark in here."
SpongeBob says: "" Got anything else, Sandy?"
Sandy says: "There's my nuttaccino machine."
Sandy says: "It makes a nice, hot frothy cup of any nut you choose."
Sandy says: "Oh, I can't even make a simple nutcracker!"
SpongeBob says: "So it's got a few bugs."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick and I'll help you fix it."
SpongeBob says: "Right, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Everything'll be fine."
Sandy says: "Oh, it's no use, SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "I just have to face facts."
Sandy says: "I'm leaving Bikini Bottom because..."
Sandy says: "I'm a failure."
SpongeBob says: "We can't let Sandy leave, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "What'll we do?"
SpongeBob says: "They're looking for an invention, right?"
Patrick says: "Right."
SpongeBob says: "So let's start inventing!"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "It's time to get serious, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Right!"
Patrick says: "I made an invention."
Patrick says: "It's a stick you can draw or write stuff with."
SpongeBob says: "That's a pencil, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "It's already been invented."
Patrick says: "Ooh, ooh, this is a good one!"
Patrick says: "It's a glass ball that lights up so you can see in the dark."
SpongeBob says: "Light bulb, already invented."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, I know this one will work."
Patrick says: "I've invented a parallel universe."
SpongeBob says: "That's a mirror, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "It's already been invented."
Patrick says: "Somebody keeps stealing my ideas!"
SpongeBob's Reflection says: "Well, I thought it was a pretty good idea."
Sandy says: "â™ªSo long, Bikini Bottom, I can't leave without a good-bye."
Sandy says: "But please don't think bad of me, if'n I start to cry."
Sandy says: "So long, Bikini Bottom, there's so many things I'll miss, from your smoggy, crowded city, to your stingin' jellyfish."
Sandy says: "This town is filled with many things, that I've come to love."
Sandy says: "From the birds that fly upon the ground, to the flowers up above."
Sandy says: "Farewell, Bikini Bottom, now I really hate to go."
Sandy says: "'Cause the things I'll miss the most of all, are the friends I've come to know."
SpongeBob says: "We've done it, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "We've created the greatest invention the world has ever seen!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, they're here."
Patrick says: "Who?"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy's bosses."
SpongeBob says: "The reason we spent all afternoon inventing!"
Chimp #1 says: "Good day, gentlemen."
Chimp #1 says: "Allow me to introduce ourselves."
Chimp #1 says: "I am Professor Percy."
Chimp #1 says: "This is Dr."
Chimp #1 says: "Marmalade."
Dr. Marmalade says: "At your service."
Professor Percy says: "And this is Lord Reginald."
Lord Reginald says: "Charmed."
Patrick says: "You guys talk funny."
Patrick says: "Say more words!"
Professor Percy says: "We are the board of directors of Tree Dome Enterprises Limited, and we are here to ascertain if Miss Cheek's inventions are up to snuff."
SpongeBob says: "Why, everyone in town has benefited from Sandy's scientific knowledge!"
SpongeBob says: "Before Sandy showed up, I used to be a scrawny weakling!"
Patrick says: "And I used to be dumb."
Professor Percy says: "Quite."
Professor Percy says: "And whom do I have the pleasure of addressing?"
SpongeBob says: "My name is SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "And I am Professor Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Professor?"
Patrick says: "Doctor Professor Patrick."
Patrick says: "Don't mind him."
Patrick says: "You know how interns are."
Professor Percy says: "Where is Miss Cheeks?"
SpongeBob says: "She should be back any moment."
Patrick says: "I thought she ran away because she couldn't invent anything."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
Patrick says: "That's Mr."
Patrick says: "Doctor Professor Patrick to you!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't you think it's time to show them Sandy's invention, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Doctor Professor Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Good idea."
SpongeBob says: "Well?"
Patrick says: "Hey, you're the unpaid intern."
Patrick says: "You do the work."
SpongeBob says: "Gentlemen, I can say without exaggeration that this is the most important invention in the history of the universe!"
SpongeBob says: "I give you..."
SpongeBob says: "The Automatic Backscratcher, Hair Comber, Nose Picker, and Ukulele Tuner 9000!"
Professor Percy says: "This is where our research money went?"
SpongeBob says: "Uh-huh."
SpongeBob says: "Isn't it great?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Lord Reginald says: "An automatic back scratcher, hair comber, nose picker, ukulele tuner."
Lord Reginald says: "Yes, well, I've heard that claim before."
Professor Percy says: "Yes, how do we know this contraption works?"
Dr. Marmalade says: "Let's see a demonstration."
Patrick says: "Step right up."
Patrick says: "You look like you've been neglecting your personal hygiene."
Lord Reginald says: "Me?"
Lord Reginald says: "Are you sure this is safe?"
Patrick says: "As sure as I'm a doctor professor."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, don't you think we should test it?"
Patrick says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "That's not exactly what I had in mind!"
Professor Percy says: "Lord Reginald, are you all right?"
Lord Reginald says: "Oh I say, this is splendid."
Lord Reginald says: "Oh marvelous."
Lord Reginald says: "This machine has evacuated my nostrils of unwanted residue in a manner most pleasant."
SpongeBob says: "Good work, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Doctor Professor Patrick."
Patrick says: "Thank you, lowly assistant."
Lord Reginald says: "Oh I say, now it's feeding me delicious pudding!"
SpongeBob says: "Pudding?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't remember that part of the invention."
Lord Reginald says: "Now it's tuning my ukulele!"
Dr. Marmalade says: "Lord Reginald, are you all right?"
Dr. Marmalade says: "Um sorry, was that a yes?"
Professor Percy says: "Mr."
Professor Percy says: "Doctor Professor Patrick, what is the meaning of this?"
Patrick says: "It's okay."
Patrick says: "The horrible screaming means that it's working!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh I really wish Sandy were here."
Bus Driver says: "All aboard!"
Sandy says: "Will this bus take you somewhere when you've got nowhere else to go?"
Bus Driver says: "It sure does."
Bus Driver says: "We make stops in Quittersville, Failuretown, and Loserburg."
Sandy says: "What in tarnation?!"
Sandy says: "!"
Patrick laughs.
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "What the heck is going on here?!"
Sandy says: "!"
Lord Reginald says: "Ouch."
Patrick says: "It works!"
Patrick says: "It works!"
Professor Percy says: "Lord Reginald, are you all right?"
Lord Reginald says: "I seem to have ruptured my pomposity."
Professor Percy says: "We shall commence closure of this establishment immediately."
Dr. Marmalade says: "Frankly, I'm beginning to question the economic benefits of underwater treedomes."
Dr. Marmalade says: "Doesn't make much sense once you get right down to it."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "We were trying to keep you in Bikini Bottom, but all we did was ruin your chances to stay."
Sandy says: "I was about to be fired anyway."
Sandy says: "Thanks for trying to help, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "You, too, Patrick."
Patrick says: "That's Mr."
Patrick says: "Doctor Professor Patrick."
Sandy says: "Don't push it."
Patrick says: "Sorry."
Professor Percy says: "We are departing, Dr."
Professor Percy says: "Marmalade."
Dr. Marmalade says: "My word, all of this excitement has drastically reduced my potassium levels."
Dr. Marmalade says: "Good gracious!"
Dr. Marmalade says: "Can it be?"
Professor Percy says: "Try it again."
Lord Reginald says: "Oh!"
Lord Reginald says: "It is!"
Lord Reginald says: "It is!"
Lord Reginald says: "It's the banana peeler we have been searching 117 years for!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow Sandy, they're going bananas for your nutcracker!"
Sandy says: "Yeah."
Professor Percy says: "Well, Miss Cheeks, I must say you have exceeded expectations."
Lord Reginald says: "It may be the extreme head trauma I've suffered, but I am going to offer you a 20-year contract with a substantial pay raise."
Sandy says: "I accept."
SpongeBob says: "Hooray!"
Patrick says: "Hooray!"
Professor Percy says: "I expect great things out of you, Miss Cheeks."
Professor Percy says: "Great things."
Lord Reginald says: "Perhaps you could put your talents toward that automatic poop-throwing machine that's eluded us for so long."
Dr. Marmalade says: "Now, now, one miracle at a time."
All Chimps says: "Goodbye!"
Sandy says: "Well, the only thing left is to figure out what to do with this infernal contraption."
Patrick says: "My turn."
Patrick says: "All right!"
