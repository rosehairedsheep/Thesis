Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Say, what are you burning out here, boy?"
SpongeBob says: "Hmm..."
SpongeBob says: "I'd say a high grade explosive."
Mr. Krabs says: "Explosive!"
Mr. Krabs says: "?"
Plankton says: "Ha ha ha ha!"
Plankton says: "Enjoy, Eugene!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I just had that roof redone last week!"
Plankton says: "You will be re-re-doing it after I'm through with you!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ready ammunition!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Another dud, Plankton."
Plankton says: "A dud, huh?"
Mr Krabs says: "Oh, you're playing with fire now, Plankton!"
Plankton says: "No need to get worked up over this, Krabs, just give me the secret formula and I’ll be on my way."
Mr. Krabs says: "You ain't getting it."
Plankton says: "I implore you to reconsider."
Mr. Krabs says: "Go jump off a plank."
Plankton says: "I have ways of getting the information I need."
Plankton says: "Where’s the formula, Krabs?"
Plankton says: "Still not going to talk, eh, Krabs?"
Plankton says: "Okay, Krabs, I see you're not going to crack."
Plankton says: "But I don't think your underling is of the same metal."
SpongeBob says: "I'll never talk."
Plankton says: "We’ll see what Mr."
Plankton says: "Feather has to say about that."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, okay!"
SpongeBob says: "But I don't how to get into the safe behind the painting in Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs' office that houses the secret formula."
SpongeBob says: "He won't let me near it."
Everyone pauses.
Plankton says: "Clever."
Plankton says: "Behind the painting, eh, Krabs?"
Plankton says: "Incidentally, what am I smelling?"
Plankton says: "You got something burning?"
SpongeBob says: "Smells like blubber to me."
Plankton says: "Bl-bl-blubber?"
Pearl says: "Daddy!"
Plankton says: "Call off your daughter, Krabs!"
Plankton says: "Call her off!"
Mr. Krabs says: "She's a big girl, Plankton, I have no control over what she does."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, and you better watch out."
Mr. Krabs says: "I think she's extra hungry today."
Plankton says: "Stay back, whale!"
Plankton says: "I'm privy to what you do to organisms like me."
Plankton says: "I've seen those documentaries!"
Pearl says: "Did he just go into the freezer?"
Plankton says: "Don't say it!"
Pearl says: "I prefer salad over Plankton, anyway."
Mr. Krabs says: "Who knew Plankton was so afraid of whales?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Pearl, me darling daughter, you saved my business and my formula, now get us out of this trap."
Pearl says: "Mall money."
Mr. Krabs says: "Alright, alright."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're gettin' more like your old man every day."
Mr. Krabs gives a dollar to Pearl out of his chest like an ATM machine.
Pearl says: "Thanks, Daddy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Why don't you swing by the Chum Bucket on your way to the mall?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Give Plankton a scare."
Pearl says: "Double my mall money!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Your turn to chip in, boy."
SpongeBob says: "Sure."
SpongeBob says: "Here you go."
SpongeBob says: "Buy yourself something pretty."
Pearl says: "Hey, this isn't money!"
SpongeBob says: "No, it's even better!"
SpongeBob says: "This is what Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs pays me with."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs' Wacky Bucks!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Please, Pearl?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll do your homework for you."
Pearl says: "No way!"
Pearl says: "The Chum Bucket is, like, totally gross!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hmmm..."
Mr. Krabs says: "in that case, Pearl, I'm gonna need to borrow one of your dressers."
SpongeBob says: "Hummina-hunh?"
Pearl says: "Hummina-hunh?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?!"
Pearl says: "Huh?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Pearl says: "!"
Cut to the Chum Bucket.
Karen says: "My triumphant husband returns."
Karen says: "How'd you fail this time?"
Plankton says: "Krabs had a whale!"
Karen says: "You mean his big, bad, scary teenage daughter?"
Plankton says: "I hear that mocking tone in your voice, Karen, and I don't appreciate it."
Plankton says: "Don't you remember what happened to my ancestors at the hands of those beasts?"
Plankton's family is shown being eaten by a whale.
Karen says: "Okay, when you need a break from your delusional paranoia, the trash needs some attention."
Karen says: "It's ripened."
Bubble transition to Plankton taking out the trash.
Pearl says: "I'm hungry!"
Plankton says: "That should keep her out!"
Pearl says: "I want plankton meat!"
Plankton says: "Holy protozoas!"
Plankton says: "Karen, she's here!"
Plankton says: "She got in!"
Karen says: "What are you talking about?"
Plankton says: "There's a whale in the laboratory!"
Karen says: "Are you out of your mind?"
Plankton says: "See for yourself!"
Karen says: "No whale in here."
Plankton says: "I swear!"
Plankton says: "A whale was just in here."
Plankton says: "She was next to the transmutator."
Plankton says: "She was right here in this spot!"
Plankton says: "Her mouth all frothy, her blowhole blowing!"
Karen says: "Oh, that's enough, Plankton."
Karen says: "If you'll excuse me, I have to get back to more pertinent binary functions."
Plankton says: "Karen!"
Plankton says: "Karen--!"
Narrator says: "16 paranoia filled days later..."
Plankton says: "Yes, I can hear you."
Plankton says: "Can you bring it up?"
Plankton says: "I can't risk stepping into the light."
Plankton says: "The whale might see me."
Pearl says: "."
Grand-Dad says: "Hey, Plankton!"
Grand-Dad says: "Glad you could join the rest of the family!"
Plankton says: "Grand-Dad?"
Grand-Dad says: "Yep, and you're pretty brave standing in that there gastric acid."
Plankton says: "Gastric acid?"
Plankton says: "That's it."
Plankton says: "I'm done."
Plankton says: "The 4:15 bus should be along any time now."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Plankton."
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing laying in the middle of the road?"
Plankton says: "Go away, Cheese head!"
Plankton says: "Can't you see I'm trying to get run over?"
Plankton says: "In fact, better yet, just step on me as hard as you can."
Plankton says: "Would you do that for me?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Plankton, but that flies in the face of my good nature."
Plankton says: "Forget it, kid."
Plankton says: "I'll just wait for the next bus."
Plankton says: "Go on back to the Krusty Krab and enjoy yourself."
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
Cut to the Krusty Krab, in Mr. Krabs' office.
Mr. Krabs says: "Goodbye, pipsqueak!"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry to interrupt your gloating, sir."
SpongeBob says: "I just thought it would be pertinent for you to know that Plankton is laying on the street, forlorn."
Mr. Krabs says: "Really?"
Mr. Krabs says: "He's a mess!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I know you and Plankton are sworn enemies and all, but putting on a dress to frighten him?"
SpongeBob says: "Isn't that taking it a little too far?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Need I remind you of the fact that you've disclosed the location of me safe, where I keep the secret formula?"
SpongeBob says: "No need to remind me, sir."
SpongeBob says: "I broke Rule #2 of the Krusty Krab Rule Book: Never disclose the location of the secret formula!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, sir."
SpongeBob says: "I can fix this."
Plankton says: "Man, what does it take to get run over around here?!"
Plankton says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Plankton."
Plankton says: "What, do you got mud in your ears?"
Plankton says: "Take a hike!"
SpongeBob says: "Ah, yes, I remember."
SpongeBob says: "But very quickly, I just wanted to tell that the secret formula is not, I repeat not, in the safe behind the painting in the Krusty Krab."
Plankton says: "Why should I care?"
Plankton says: "All meaning has left my life ever since I've been plagued by that blasted whale."
SpongeBob says: "It's okay."
SpongeBob says: "Everybody has a secret fear!"
SpongeBob says: "For instance, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs' secret fear is..."
Plankton says: "Really?"
SpongeBob says: "Mmm-hmm, and guess what else?"
SpongeBob says: "That was Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs in a whale suit that you've been scared of."
Plankton says: "You mean this entire time it's been Krabs masquerading as a whale!"
Plankton says: "?"
Plankton says: "Why that conniving bottom feeder!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, luckily, you wouldn't have use for such innocuous information, would you?"
Plankton says: "Uh, of course not."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, all-righty, back to your self-destructive behavior, Plankton."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for the talk!"
Plankton says: "Oh, no, thank you!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Whoo-ho!"
Mr. Krabs says: "This is too much fun!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton ain't even a challenge no more!"
Plankton says: "Oh, is that so?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, Back for more, are you?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, well, here it goes."
Mr. Krabs says: "Boo!"
Plankton says: "You don't scare me, Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "I ain't Krabs, I'm..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I mean..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm Pearl, not Krabs."
Plankton says: "The jig is up, Krabs."
Plankton says: "I know all about the suit, and your secret fear!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Secret fear?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you talkin' about?"
Plankton says: "See for yourself."
Mr. Krabs says: "No."
Mr. Krabs says: "No."
Mr. Krabs says: "No!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Muh-muh-make it stop!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Make it stop!"
Plankton says: "I am loving this."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Plankton, if I were you, I wouldn't be so smug."
Plankton says: "Why not?"
SpongeBob says: "Because a hungry pod of whales just showed up for its early feeding."
Mr. Krabs says: "Whew!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, you redeemed yourself, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, you really are creeping me out now."
