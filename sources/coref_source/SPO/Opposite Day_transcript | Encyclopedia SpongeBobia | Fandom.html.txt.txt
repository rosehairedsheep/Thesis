We see Squidward's house at sunrise. A clam crows like a rooster. Pan-fades to inside Squidward's house, where Squidward is asleep and hears noises. He awakens, revealing SpongeBob and Patrick under his blanket with a sign that reads "happy birthday".
SpongeBob says: "Surprise!"
Patrick says: "Surprise!"
SpongeBob says: "Happy birthday, Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Happy birthday, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "So long, Squidward, bye-bye, don't do anything I wouldn't do."
Patrick says: "Another year older."
Squidward says: "That's it!"
Squidward says: "I'm moving out of this neighborhood!"
Realtor Lady says: "I can sell your home in a heartbeat."
Squidward says: "Oh, that's great news, because I want to move as soon as possible."
Incidental 49A says: "No problem!"
Incidental 49A says: "As long as it's not infested with nematodes, or surrounded by troublesome neighbors or something like that."
Squidward says: "Oh sure, there's none of that..."
Squidward says: "Did you say "neighbors?"
Incidental 49A says: "Of course!"
Incidental 49A says: "I can't tell you how many times I've seen a sale fall through because of bad neighbors."
Squidward says: "Neighbors."
Squidward says: "Uhh..."
Incidental 49A says: "Anyway, I'll be by tomorrow to check out the house."
Incidental 49A says: "See you then!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "No one will ever buy my house with him living next door!"
Squidward says: "Whatever a good neighbor would do, he does the opposite!"
SpongeBob says: "Umm, Squidward, why are you playing that drum?"
Squidward says: "Drum?"
Squidward says: "What drum?"
Squidward says: "Come on, SpongeBob, tackle me!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "You need bed rest!"
SpongeBob says: "I'll keep you safe until you're well again."
Squidward says: "Oh, I get it."
Squidward says: "You don't know what day it is, do you?"
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, Wednesday?"
Squidward says: "Why, it's Opposite Day!"
SpongeBob says: "Does everybody know about Opposite Day?"
Squidward says: "Oh sure!"
Squidward says: "It's a game!"
Squidward says: "Get it?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, a game."
Squidward says: "Yeah!"
Squidward says: "Normally, you're really loud and annoying, so what are you going to be today?"
SpongeBob says: "Quiet and out of the way!"
SpongeBob says: "Yaaaaaay!"
Squidward says: "Yeah!"
Squidward says: "Why don't you get a jump on it."
SpongeBob says: "I love..."
SpongeBob says: "I mean, I hate Opposite Day."
SpongeBob says: "I'm not ready!"
Squidward says: "So long, chum."
SpongeBob says: "Too bad it only comes once a year, huh, Gary?"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "Whereâ€™s your holiday spirit?"
SpongeBob says: "Who's there?"
Patrick says: "It's Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick..."
SpongeBob says: "go away!"
SpongeBob says: "I never want to see you again!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob doesn't like me anymore!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you're not really not my friend."
SpongeBob says: "It's just Opposite Day!"
Patrick says: "Opposite Day?"
Patrick says: "Hey, I've heard of that!"
SpongeBob says: "You have?"
Patrick says: "No!"
Patrick says: "What is it?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, whatever you normally do, today you do the opposite."
Patrick says: "Oh!"
Patrick says: "Let me try!"
Patrick says: "Let me try!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, breathe!"
SpongeBob says: "Not that opposite."
SpongeBob says: "Let me show you how to do it the wrong way!"
SpongeBob and Patrick dance across the screen as SpongeBob is pink and Patrick is yellow. Gary eats properly from a table.
SpongeBob says: "Meow."
Patrick says: "Meow."
SpongeBob and Patrick both blow a bubble, but they blow themselves into bubbles, instead. Patrick pops.
SpongeBob says: "Kcirtap ,yeh."
Patrick says: "Pu evig i."
SpongeBob says: "Edis etisoppo eht ot teg ot!"
Both laugh in reverse. Cut back to house.
SpongeBob says: "Say, want to help me do some work around the house, worst enemy?"
Patrick says: "Nope."
Squidward says: "Nearly noon and not a peep from SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Hello, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Oops."
SpongeBob says: "I mean, goodbye, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Aww, isn't Opposite Day..."
Squidward says: "I'll tell you what's terrible..."
Squidward says: "living next to you!"
Squidward says: "You're the worst neighbor in history!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "That's the nicest thing Squidward has ever said to me!"
Patrick says: "Isn't it beautiful?"
SpongeBob says: "On Opposite Day it is."
Squidward says: "Out of the way, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't get it."
SpongeBob says: "I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard,  Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Hey!"
Patrick says: "I wanna be opposite, too!"
Patrick says: "I'm Squidward, I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "It's not enough to look like Squidward to be opposite..."
SpongeBob says: "Now you try."
Patrick says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "I'm Squidward."
Patrick says: "I'm Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I'm Squidward."
Patrick says: "I'm Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward."
Patrick says: "I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "After you, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward."
Patrick says: "Why, thank you, Mr."
Patrick says: "Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "You're quite welcome, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward."
Incidental 49A says: "Oh my!"
Incidental 49A says: "The house is even more beautiful in person!"
Incidental 49A says: "Uh..."
Incidental 49A says: "Mr."
Incidental 49A says: "Tentacles?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, please come in."
Incidental 49A says: "It's funny, I pictured you being much taller."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, everyone says that."
Incidental 49A says: "Now if you want the sale to go through, you've got to tell me all the positive things about your house."
SpongeBob says: "I'd love to."
SpongeBob says: "The floor creaks, the roof leaks, there's a terrible draft."
Incidental 49A says: "Uhh..."
Incidental 49A says: "well, you didn't mention that on the phone."
SpongeBob says: "Please, let me finish."
SpongeBob says: "The winters are harsh, the summers are brutal."
SpongeBob says: "There's a wild man-eating clam in the backyard!"
SpongeBob says: "Now, would you care to see the rest of my home?"
Incidental 49A says: "Well, umm, I'm not sure if I'm interested..."
SpongeBob says: "Nonsense!"
SpongeBob says: "I won't take no for an answer."
SpongeBob says: "And here's the worst room in the house."
SpongeBob says: "My gallery."
Patrick says: "Thank you!"
Incidental 49A says: "Who's that?!"
Incidental 49A says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I'd like to introduce you to Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward."
Incidental 49A says: "You're both Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm Squidward, he's Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "We're both Squidward."
Patrick says: "We're both Squidward."
Squidward says: "Well, that's done."
Squidward says: "At least SpongeBob has been quiet."
Incidental 49A says: "Okay, I really don't want to hear another one."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
Incidental 49A says: "I really don't want to hear more, thank you."
SpongeBob says: "I hear you loud and clear."
Squidward says: "haven't harmed you in any way."
Incidental 49A says: "Who are you?"
Squidward says: "Why, I'm Squidward!"
Incidental 49A says: "he's Squidward, you're Squidward..."
Incidental 49A says: "I'm Squidward!"
Incidental 49A says: "Are there any other Squidwards I should know about?!"
Incidental 49A says: "!"
Gary says: "Meow."
Squidward says: "Ma'am, please!"
Squidward says: "What about my house?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Incidental 49A says: "I wouldn't sell a house for you if you were the last Squidward on Earth!"
Squidward says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't..."
Patrick says: "..."
Patrick says: "Go!"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "No!"
Incidental 49A says: "Stop!"
Incidental 49A says: "Stop!"
Squidward says: "Please, sell my house!"
Squidward says: "Don't leave me here!"
Squidward says: "Let me show you guys how much I..."
Squidward says: "hate you!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, do you ever get the feeling that Squidward likes us too much?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
