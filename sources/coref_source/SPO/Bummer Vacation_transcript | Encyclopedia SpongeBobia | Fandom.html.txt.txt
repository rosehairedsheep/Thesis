Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Just put me out of my misery."
SpongeBob says: "Why, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "What could be wrong on this fine day?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Fine?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Time off?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, I guess there's no other way to say this..."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, take a vacation."
SpongeBob says: "Aye aye, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, that went better than expected."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Gary."
Gary says: "Meow?"
SpongeBob says: "That's right, Gary, I am home early."
SpongeBob says: "I'm on vacation."
SpongeBob says: "Well, good night, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "Good morning, Krusty Krew!"
SpongeBob says: "Hello, Squidward."
Squidward says: "I thought you were on vacation."
Mr. Krabs says: "He was and is."
Mr. Krabs says: "I told you to take a vacation, boy."
SpongeBob says: "What's a vacation?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, a vacation is when you don't come into work."
SpongeBob says: "No work?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "But what'll I do all day?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, I dunno."
Mr. Krabs says: "Just go have fun or whatever."
Mr. Krabs says: "I really don't care."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ya just can't be here."
SpongeBob says: "But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward can't do it all alone."
Squidward says: "Nor will I."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's why I've hired an unpaid intern as your temporary replacement."
Patrick says: "Good morning, boss."
Patrick says: "I'm ready for my first day."
Mr. Krabs says: "Speaking of starfish, here's your replacement right here."
SpongeBob says: "Replacement?"
Patrick says: "Hi, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's enough banter on my dime."
Patrick says: "Ok, boss."
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait a second, Patrick."
Mr. Krabs says: "You'll need the right tools for the job."
Patrick says: "Wow."
Patrick says: "Wow."
Patrick says: "It scratches backs, too!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ah, take it from me, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "Just go on home."
Mr. Krabs says: "Enjoy your vacation."
SpongeBob says: "I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "I'm on vacation, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "I'm not allowed to go to work."
Squidward says: "Go away, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "You're ruining my vacation..."
Squidward says: "from you."
SpongeBob says: "I'm not here to see you, Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, do we have to go through this again?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm here as a customer not as an employee."
SpongeBob says: "Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick for lunch."
Mr. Krabs says: "Alright, but lunch only."
Mr. Krabs says: "If you so much as touch a spatuler, you'll be vacationing in Davey Jones' locker."
SpongeBob says: "You have my word, sir."
SpongeBob says: "No working."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you can't do that!"
Patrick says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What did I tell you about working?"
SpongeBob says: "Wait, it's not what you think."
Mr. Krabs says: "Out you go, boy."
SpongeBob says: "But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab."
Mr. Krabs says: "We've got it all under control here."
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't want to see hide or tail of ya 'til your vacation is over."
Mr. Krabs says: "You got that?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, boy..."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, what to do, what to do."
SpongeBob says: "I know just the thing to get the spirits up."
SpongeBob says: "The official Krusty Krab playset."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, I need 20 Krabby Patties on the double, please."
SpongeBob says: "Sure thing, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, sir."
SpongeBob says: "20 Krabby Patties coming up."
Squidward says: "I need 20 Krabby Patties, please."
SpongeBob says: "Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid."
SpongeBob says: "20 Krabby Patties coming..."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "You're right, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation."
SpongeBob says: "I need to get out of the house."
Squidward says: "Uh, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, he's out there again."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll deal with this."
Mr. Krabs says: "Boy, you're on Krusty Krab property."
Mr. Krabs says: "Back it up."
Mr. Krabs says: "That'll do."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs is right."
SpongeBob says: "In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work."
SpongeBob says: "Physically and mentally."
Delivery Fish says: "Huh?"
Delivery Fish says: "What's the big idea, here?"
Patrick says: "Hello?"
Patrick says: "Hello?"
Patrick says: "Hello?"
Patrick says: "Hey, I just cleaned that one."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, shhh."
Patrick says: "It talks!"
SpongeBob says: "Somebody help, I'm stuck!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh oh."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now what?"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for the ride home, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Not a problem at all, me boy."
SpongeBob says: "Just take the next right."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, we just passed the turn off."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh-huh."
SpongeBob says: "My house is back that way, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "K."
Mr. Krabs says: "Far out, little man."
Mr. Krabs says: "Far out."
SpongeBob says: "Where'd you say you were taking me?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Look, boy,  Enjoy your vacation, boy!"
SpongeBob says: "It's not fair."
SpongeBob says: "Why would Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs try so hard to get rid of me?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm only on vacation."
SpongeBob says: "Unless, it's a..."
Patrick says: "Working at the Krusty Krab."
Patrick says: "Making Krabby Patties all day."
Patrick says: "Flipping Krusty Krab working patties krab..."
Patrick says: "uhh, that's a hard song to remember."
Patrick says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Who do they think they are?"
SpongeBob says: "I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire me like that?"
SpongeBob says: "Like trash?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't think so!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob?"
Patrick says: "Is that you?"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, you're scaring me."
Patrick says: "Ahh!"
Squidward says: "Whatâ€™ll be?"
Customer says: "One Krabby Patty, please."
Squidward says: "One shell on a shingle."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, I'll be..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Patrick!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold."
Mr. Krabs says: "Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No wonder."
Mr. Krabs says: "Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour."
Mr. Krabs says: "What happened to that feller, anyway?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television."
Mr. Krabs says: "Why'd you do it, laddy?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You don't have to."
Mr. Krabs says: "The union can't fine me, anymore."
SpongeBob says: "You must've saved a fortune."
Mr. Krabs says: "Bumping barnacles, yes."
Mr. Krabs says: "There she is."
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "That's more than I make in a year."
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't be askin me for a raise."
Mr. Krabs says: "Just get back to work."
SpongeBob says: "Yippee!"
SpongeBob says: "I happily acquiesce."
