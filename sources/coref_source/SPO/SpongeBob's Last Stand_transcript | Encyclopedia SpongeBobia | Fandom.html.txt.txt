Episode starts in Jellyfish Fields, with a clam on top of the sign. He then gets out a breath spray. As soon as the sun rises, he coughs, instead of crowing. We now see SpongeBob and Patrick waiting at the main entrance.
SpongeBob says: "Just two more minutes, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Yup!"
SpongeBob says: "Look!"
SpongeBob says: "Here he comes!"
Patrick says: "Who?"
The jellyfishing ranger switches the "closed" sign to "open." He looks at SpongeBob and Patrick.
SpongeBob says: "Thank you, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Ranger."
Patrick says: "Yeah, thanks."
Ranger says: "Yes?"
SpongeBob says: "Aren't you forgetting something?"
Patrick says: "Yeah, something."
Ranger says: "jellyfishing licenses."
SpongeBob and Patrick cheer and go in, ignoring the "Open/Closed" sign they knocked over.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, look!"
SpongeBob says: "I caught a rare breed a glowing three-spot."
Patrick says: "Hey, I caught one, too!"
Patrick says: "This one's a five-spot."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, guess what?"
Patrick says: "You like it here so much, you feel yourself being moved to a song?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, yes, how did you guess?"
Patrick says: "Well, I kinda feel the movement coming on myself."
SpongeBob says: "Let's just start with the song."
Patrick says: "You mean "The Jellyfishing Song"?"
SpongeBob says: "That's the one."
SpongeBob says: "♪Jelly lelly lelly jelly, jelly lelly lelly jelly, it's the jellyfishing song!"
Patrick says: "♪Jelly lelly lelly jelly, jelly lelly lelly jelly, it's the jellyfishing song!"
Patrick says: "♪I jellyfish all da' night!"
SpongeBob says: "♪Jellyfishing make me feel all right!"
Patrick says: "♪Jellyfishing make me feel all right!"
SpongeBob says: "♪Everyone sing along!"
Patrick says: "♪Everyone sing along!"
SpongeBob says: "Isn't it great that these majestic creatures have Jellyfish Fields to call their home?"
Patrick says: "You bet!"
Patrick says: "And it's highway convenient too, according to that big sign!"
SpongeBob says: "Big sign?"
SpongeBob says: "I didn't see a big- Jumping Jellyfish!"
SpongeBob says: "That's a big sign!"
Patrick says: "It says, "Future site of the Shelly Super Highway."
SpongeBob says: "Super highway!"
SpongeBob says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Do you know what this means?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I know what a superhighway is!"
SpongeBob says: "I mean for all this jellyfish!"
SpongeBob says: "For us!"
Patrick says: "So what you're saying is, that if they go though with their plans, to build this new superhighway through Jellyfish Fields, that every single species of flora & fauna that makes this place their habitat will be forced out of the ecosystem that they have formed, effectively being destroyed?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, yeah, that's a simplified version, yeah, something like that,  which is why I hereby make this solemn vow to stop this so-called, "Shelly Super Highway," from ever being built!"
Scene now takes place in Goo Lagoon, with Larry the Lobster lifting on a barbell.
Larry says: "1,397, 1,398--  Whoa!"
SpongeBob says: "Larry, you gotta help me stop the highway!"
Larry says: "Can't right now, bro."
Larry says: "I got about 4,098 more reps to do."
SpongeBob says: "Mermaid Man!"
SpongeBob says: "Barnacle Boy!"
SpongeBob says: "Certainly with superpowers like yours, we can stop this superhighway!"
SpongeBob says: "Hmmm."
Squidward says: "I'm sorry, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "I actually would like to help, but I'm just too busy right now."
SpongeBob says: "Too busy doing what?"
Squidward says: "I'm too busy telling you, "No!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Private SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ahoy!"
SpongeBob says: "Captain Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, ahoy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Why SpongeBob, that's not your usual four-fingered salute."
SpongeBob says: "I'm just upset because they're building a highway over Jellyfish Fields."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, SpongeBob, I'd sure hate me customers to see you like this."
Mr. Krabs says: "Is there anything I can do to help?"
SpongeBob says: "Really, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Sure, why not?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "I just know that together, we can stop that nasty old highway from going right through Jellyfish Fields!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, you're not talking about the Shelly Superhighway, are ya?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, why?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh well, 'cause I'm actually in favor of that highway being built."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I've already calculated how many new customers I'll get once it's finished."
Mr. Krabs says: "You can see for yourself in this series of these charts and diagrams I have displayed!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Didn't you see!"
SpongeBob says: "?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "This."
SpongeBob says: "According to these plans."
SpongeBob says: "After the Shelly Superhighway goes right through Jellyfish Fields, it goes right over the Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "Look, there you are, decrepit and living in a cardboard box!"
SpongeBob says: "Then, it goes through a loop-de-loop for some reason, and goes right through the front door of the Chum Bucket!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What!"
Mr. Krabs says: "?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Who approved this plan!"
Mr. Krabs says: "?"
SpongeBob says: ""Plan approved by & sponsored by Sheldon J."
SpongeBob says: "Plankton Enterprises, a division of No Fun Incorporated!"
Mr. Krabs says: "C'mon, boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Let's you and I go over and show that Plankton a piece of our minds!"
SpongeBob says: "Think this piece will get the point across?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Alright, Plankton!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's Eugene Krabs, here, with, What's-His-Name!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now c'mon out!"
Plankton says: "I can't."
Mr. Krabs says: "C'mon outside, and take what's coming to ya!"
Plankton says: "I really can't come outside!"
SpongeBob says: "Why not!"
SpongeBob says: "?"
Plankton says: "Because I'm already out here, you bumbling barnacles!"
Plankton says: "Open your eyes, for cryin' out loud!"
Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob look down and see Plankton.
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, right."
Plankton says: "Now what's this all about, anyway?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't play coy with us, Shelly."
Mr. Krabs says: "We both know you've been up to no good."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now start talking."
Plankton says: "All right, so I've been stealing your mail for the past five years, big whoop."
SpongeBob says: "Not that!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You've been what?"
SpongeBob says: "We're talking about that new superhighway you're planning on building, and in case you didn't know, it's gonna destroy Jellyfish Fields."
SpongeBob says: "Not to mention that your plan is stupid and dumb and dumb and stupid."
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait a minute."
Mr. Krabs says: "You've been what?"
Plankton says: "Well, that certainly was an interesting series of words that just tumbled out past your teeth and lips, but frankly, my dear sponge, I don't give a barnacle."
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't know."
Plankton says: "Forget it."
Plankton says: "Even if I wanted to stop the Shelly Superhighway from being built, it would be impossible."
SpongeBob says: "Why?"
Plankton says: "Because the whole city has already approved it!"
Plankton says: "See for yourself, through this conveniently-timed flashback."
Mayor says: "Order."
Mayor says: "Order."
Mayor says: "Order in the Meeting Hall."
Mayor says: "Now all those in favor of paving over Jellyfish Fields and building the Shelly Superhighway, raise your right fin and say "aye."
Everyone says: "Aye!"
Mayor says: "Now everyone else, just sit there, quietly."
Fish 1 says: "I like highways."
Fish 2 says: "I like things that are super."
Mr. Krabs says: "And I like saying, "aye."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, why did I say "aye"?"
Plankton says: "Seems as though the ayes have it."
Plankton says: "Now if you'll excuse me, I've got superhighway preparations to be attending to."
Plankton says: "Toodles!"
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs now walk towards the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob says: "What are we gonna do now, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, I'm gonna do the only thing I can do when me character is tested by insurmountable odds: lie on me back and sob loudly."
SpongeBob says: "Normally, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I would lie on my back and sob loudly too, but I am not giving up!"
SpongeBob says: "There's still one citizen in Bikini Bottom who won't sit still in the face on this outrageous injustice!"
SpongeBob says: "It's working, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "They're booing the highway!"
SpongeBob says: "Looks like our message has really gotten through to the people!"
SpongeBob says: "Let's play a song while their hearts are open!"
SpongeBob says: "What does this mean!"
Patrick says: "I, couldn't tell you."
Nat says: "I'll tell you what it means!"
Nat says: "It means this!"
SpongeBob says: "It means, you hate tambourines?"
Fish says: "No!"
Police Fish #1 says: "Alright, you guys the highway haters?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes sir, but with good reason."
Police Fish #2 says: "Alright, you two."
Police Fish #2 says: "You're under arrest!"
SpongeBob says: "What for?"
Police Fish #1 says: "Unlicensed use of a sitar!"
SpongeBob says: "But, my grandma gave me this sitar!"
SpongeBob says: "It didn't come with a license."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, I'll never forget what my great-uncle Cletus said right before he was arrested during a freedom march."
SpongeBob says: "What was that?"
SpongeBob says: "I know what a freedom march is Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "I mean, what did he say?"
Patrick says: "Oh."
Patrick says: "He said, "Let not your heart walk away from you, let your mind grow legs and follow it."
SpongeBob says: "Wow."
SpongeBob says: "Your uncle sounds like a pretty smart guy, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "What happened to him after he was arrested?"
Patrick says: "I don't know, he was ever heard from him again."
Police Fish #1 says: "See ya later, longhairs!"
Patrick says: "Bye!"
SpongeBob says: "Bye!"
SpongeBob says: "See you later!"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for the lift!"
SpongeBob says: "They left us, out here in the middle of nowhere!"
Patrick says: "Oh, this isn't the middle of nowhere; We're actually on the edge of nowhere!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, at least it isn't raining!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm not ready to give up just yet!"
Patrick says: "I am!"
SpongeBob says: "If we could just come up with a better way to reach the people, something everyone can see and hear!"
Patrick says: "You mean like a parade?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh a parade!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, how did you come up with such a brilliant idea?"
Patrick says: "."
SpongeBob says: "That certainly is a parade!"
Patrick says: "Look!"
SpongeBob says: "Plankton!"
SpongeBob says: "Driving a big tractor!"
SpongeBob says: "This doesn't look good at all, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Does this?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "C'mon!"
SpongeBob says: "Let's go follow them!"
Scottish fish says: "Look, up there."
Plankton says: "Today marks the new-  Hey you there!"
Plankton says: "Are you trying to get yourself crushed!"
Plankton says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Knock it off, Patrick."
Mr. Krabs says: "I used to dream of a restaurant that have an "easy highway access!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, but this is more like "highway excess!"
Squidward says: "It's cold in here under all this concrete!"
Mr. Krabs says: "But Squidward, we can't leave!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What if we have, a customer?"
Squidward says: "Really."
Squidward says: "We haven't had a customer since the day this highway was built!"
SpongeBob says: "uh, Squidward, it's technically its a super-highway."
Squidward says: "I don't care what it is!"
Squidward says: "I'm out of here!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm on it, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "No boyo!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Not that kind!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, what are you saying?"
Mr. Krabs says: "The Krusty Krab can't stay in business."
Mr. Krabs says: "Not like this."
SpongeBob says: "It can't?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's time to activate Plan Z-99."
SpongeBob says: "Z-99!"
SpongeBob says: "?"
Squidward says: "Eugene, what is plan Z-99!"
Squidward says: "?"
Squidward says: "And more importantly, how does it affect me!"
Squidward says: "?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Plan Z-99 is,  I'm selling the Krabby Patty secret formula to Plankton!"
Squidward says: "Eugene!"
SpongeBob says: "Tell me I'm dreaming!"
Plankton says: "Uh, lower, a little lower, yeah, that's it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton, I'm ready to negotiate a price for me secret formula."
Plankton says: "Oh, goody!"
Plankton says: "Let me just wind my watch!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What for?"
Plankton says: "Did you hear that?"
Plankton says: "Karen, is that you?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Whoa nelly!"
SpongeBob says: "First I lost Jellyfish Fields, and- and..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
Squidward says: "And what?"
Squidward says: "Look at it this way, I don't have to see you every day now!"
Squidward says: "Ha, this could be the start of something beautiful!"
Squidward says: "OW!"
Squidward says: "What in the name of-!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, look!"
SpongeBob says: "All the jellyfish who used to live in Jellyfish Fields are coming to Bikini Bottom!"
Squidward says: "Yeah, but for some reason, I don't think it's to distribute holiday gift baskets!"
SpongeBob says: "Aw, ya don't?"
Plankton says: "Not the eye!"
Plankton says: "Not the eye!"
Ben says: "Chaos runs rampid in Bikini Bottom."
Bill says: "Am I on television?"
Bill says: "hey, Julie, hey, Abigail."
Bill says: "And there's my pals in El Tuna, and the gang at the Pudgy Flipper..."
Ben says: "Uh, thank you."
Ben says: "Hello, little boy, how about saying a few words into the camera about the current crisis?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, okay, I guess."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry I am a little nervous."
Ben says: "That's understandable, just speak loud and clear."
SpongeBob says: "Well, all I have to say is that, um, well,  Stop the madness!"
SpongeBob says: "We need to get Jellyfish Fields back to the jellyfish, which will restore their natural habitat, so they will be in peace."
SpongeBob says: "And balance will once again restore to their natural land."
SpongeBob says: "So what do you say, everybody?"
SpongeBob says: "Will you help me?"
Everybody says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "You're kidding, right?"
Everybody says: "Yes!"
SpongeBob says: "Well all right!"
SpongeBob says: "Everybody, follow me."
Everybody runs over the cameraman to Jellyfish Fields.. The scene cuts to SpongeBob in the tractor ready to tear down the Shelly Superhighway.
SpongeBob says: "Okay everyone, say goodbye to the worst thing that's happened to this town since 97 cent stores."
Everyone says: "Yeah!"
Plankton says: "Good effort, Spongedope, but you can't tear up my highway, it's indestructible!"
Larry Lobster says: "Not if we have anything to do with it!"
SpongeBob says: "Larry Lobster!"
Larry says: "That's right, pal, but that's not all."

SpongeBob says: "Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff!"

Plankton says: "I didn't count on all of you working together!"

Plankton says: "Stop, you can't!"
Everyone says: "Yeah!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Praise Neptune."
