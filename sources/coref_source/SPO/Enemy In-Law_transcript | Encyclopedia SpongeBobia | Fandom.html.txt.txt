Karen says: "You said it, not me."
Karen says: "You know, you're lucky to have me."

Mama Krabs says: "Eugene!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Mommy!"
Mama Krabs says: "What did I tell ye about interfering in me life?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Mommy, can't you see?"
Mr. Krabs says: "He's trying to seduce the Krabby Patty formula right from under you."
Mama Krabs says: "For your information, Eugene, he hasn't asked me once about the formula."
Mama Krabs says: "I doubt that he even knows that I know it."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, yeah..."
Mr. Krabs says: "funny thing about that."
Mama Krabs says: "I forbid ye to interfere in me private business."
Mama Krabs says: "Go to your office, now!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes, mommy."

Mr. Krabs says: "Don't marry this bad, bad man!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't want you to!"
Plankton says: "Too late, Krabsy."
Plankton says: "We're going to be married."
Plankton says: "And you're gonna be my new son!"
Plankton says: "Huh?"
Plankton says: "What's this, honey bunch?"
Mama Krabs says: "I'm flattered by your offer, really I am, but I'm just not ready for that kind of commitment."
Plankton says: "What is this?"
Plankton says: "There's somebody else, isn't there?"
ChumBot says: "I..."
ChumBot says: "I..."
ChumBot says: "this is very uncomfortable."
ChumBot says: "I'll just wait in the car."
Plankton says: "I don't believe this!"
Plankton says: "You led me on!"
Mama Krabs says: "Now, now Plankton, it's not what you think."
Plankton says: "I don't wanna hear your lies!"
Plankton says: "You owe me for leading on like this!"
Plankton says: "Give me the Krabby Patty formula and we'll call it even."
Mama Krabs says: "The formula?"
Mama Krabs says: "Is that what this whole thing was about?"
Plankton says: "No!"
Plankton says: "No, not really."
Plankton says: "I mean..."
Plankton says: "not at first."
Plankton says: "I mean uh..."
Plankton says: "Uh, honey bunch?"
