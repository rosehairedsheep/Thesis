Narrator says: "Ahoy, kids."
Narrator says: "It's time for SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special!"
Pirates says: "Hooray!"
Narrator says: "And now the host of You Wish."
Narrator says: "He's got puffier pantaloons than Captain Kidd, and fuzzier facial hair than Blackbeard."
Narrator says: "He's America's favorite Pirate, Patchy of Encino!"
Patchy says: "It's call-in-and-vote time."
Patchy says: "You get to choose how our cartoon ends today, via the phone, or the Internet if you're technologically inclined."
Potty says: "Bawk!"
Potty says: "In what way?"
Patchy says: "Well, if it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot."
Patchy says: "Potty, say hello to the nice people."
Potty says: "Help!"
Potty says: "I'm being held here against my will."
Potty says: "Help!"
Patchy says: "Argh..."
Patchy says: "Potty?"
Patchy says: "You in there, buddy?"
Patchy says: "Potty?"
Patchy says: "Potty?"
Then the screen reveals that Patchy is in a cannon that is pointing outside the window.
Potty says: "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
Patchy says: "Get me out of here, you scurvy bird!"
Patchy says: "You're not gonna make this easy, are ya?"
Patchy says: "Quiet!"
Patchy says: "I'm not there!"
Patchy says: "Belate that ringing!"
Patchy says: "Stop!"
Patchy says: "It's driving me mad!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "The sky had a baby!"
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "The sky had a baby!"
SpongeBob says: "I know!"
SpongeBob says: "What do you think we should name it?"
Patrick says: "How about..."
Squidward says: "Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope?"
Squidward says: "I'm sure it goes somewhere far away!"
Squidward says: "Now look what you've done!"
SpongeBob says: "We didn't do it, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Our hands are clean!"
Patrick says: "Clean..."
Squidward says: "Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing."
SpongeBob says: "Wouldn't that be the top?"
SpongeBob says: "Squid, wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
Patrick says: "Squidward!"
Narrator says: "A few inches later..."
SpongeBob says: "Ship!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?"
SpongeBob says: "No, look, a giant ship!"
Squidward says: "Great!"
Squidward says: "Let's go!"
Squidward says: "Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind."
SpongeBob says: "I don't know, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "That ship has a spooky green glow around it."
Squidward says: "That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place."
SpongeBob says: "Squid, wait!"
Squidward says: "All right, who owns this crate?"
SpongeBob says: "Doesn't this place seem familiar?"
Patrick says: "I don't know."
Patrick says: "Why?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know."
SpongeBob says: "Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell?"
Patrick says: "Yes!"
SpongeBob says: "I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name."
Flying Dutchman says: "Rawr!"
SpongeBob says: "No, no, it's not "rawr!"
Flying Dutchman says: "I am the Flying Dutchman!"
SpongeBob says: "That's it!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman's own lair?"
Squidward says: "I..."
Squidward says: "no, I don't."
SpongeBob says: "Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all?"
Squidward says: "I never said that."
Flying Dutchman says: "Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!"
SpongeBob says: "No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship."
Squidward says: "Ow."
Flying Dutchman says: "You're next!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Welcome back!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Welcome back!"
Squidward says: "Hey!"
Squidward says: "How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon?"
Squidward says: "If you ask me, it's..."
Flying Dutchman says: "So, are you gonna try that again?"
Patrick says: "Probably."
Flying Dutchman says: "How 'bout now?"
Patrick says: "Uhh..."
Flying Dutchman says: "Now listen."
Squidward says: "Will we be getting business cards?"
Flying Dutchman says: "Silence!"
Flying Dutchman says: "You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people."
Flying Dutchman says: "It'll be grueling, mind-numbing, and repetitive."
Flying Dutchman says: "Just like..."
Flying Dutchman says: "daytime television."
Squidward says: "Now you listen here, mister."
Squidward says: "If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy."
Squidward says: "I mean, look at this place."
Squidward says: "It's disgusting!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Would anyone else like to enter the "Fly of Despair"?"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "We know our place now, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Dutchman."
Patrick says: "We'll do anything you say!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Then, for starters, you can..."
Flying Dutchman says: "swab the deck!"
SpongeBob says: "Look, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "A real, live, ghost mop!"
Patrick says: "And I got this hat!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Listen!"
Flying Dutchman says: "We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!"
SpongeBob says: "You mean you want it to look good..."
SpongeBob says: "and scary."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I think we can probably..."
Patrick says: "No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary."
SpongeBob says: "Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!"
Patrick says: "I don't get it."
SpongeBob says: "Look, it's easy, it simply means that..."
Flying Dutchman says: "Never mind what it means!"
Flying Dutchman says: "I just want it to look scary!"
Flying Dutchman says: "That's it!"
Flying Dutchman says: "You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink."
SpongeBob says: "So, you don't want it to look good?"
Flying Dutchman says: "Get moving!"
SpongeBob says: "A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!"
Patrick says: "A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!"
Flying Dutchman says: "What a night be this!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear!"
Patrick says: "Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!"
Patrick says: "Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!"
Patrick says: "Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Eh, that'll do."
Flying Dutchman says: "Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim."
Flying Dutchman says: "Here, use this spyglass."
Flying Dutchman says: "Now hurry up!"
Flying Dutchman says: "We're burnin' moonlight!"
SpongeBob says: "Let's see who we can find."
Billy says: "I had four biscuits, and I ate one."
Billy says: "Then I only had three!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark."
Flying Dutchman says: "Pink One, take us behind those rocks."
Patrick says: "Moving behind the rocks!"
SpongeBob says: "Keep going."
SpongeBob says: "You're good."
SpongeBob says: "You're good."
SpongeBob says: "You're good..."
SpongeBob says: "and..."
SpongeBob says: "stop."
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches."
Flying Dutchman says: "All right, never mind it."
Flying Dutchman says: "Just jump out when I give the signal."
Flying Dutchman says: "Boo!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates!"
SpongeBob says: "Was that the signal?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, sorry, sorry, just..."
SpongeBob says: "just do it again."
Flying Dutchman says: "With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates!"
Patrick says: "How does he do that?"
Flying Dutchman says: "Get back on the ship."
SpongeBob says: "It's still a mystery!"
Patrick says: "It's still a mystery!"
Billy says: "Those guys are dorks."
Flying Dutchman says: "Yes, but they're my dorks."
SpongeBob says: "You're good."
SpongeBob says: "You're good."
SpongeBob says: "You're good."
SpongeBob says: "Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?"
Patrick says: "Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!"
SpongeBob says: "Like movie passes?"
Patrick says: "Or an oversized coffee mug?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Flying Dutchman says: "I've been thinking."
Flying Dutchman says: "Stop bouncing!"
Flying Dutchman says: "This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out."
Flying Dutchman says: "It's not really you so much as it is me."
SpongeBob says: "You're setting us free?"
Flying Dutchman says: "Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you."
Flying Dutchman says: "See you at dinner!"
Patrick says: "Wait, I have an idea!"
SpongeBob says: "Really?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "What is it?"
Patrick says: "Let's leave!"
SpongeBob says: "But the door is locked and the only way out is through the..."
SpongeBob says: "perfume department."
Patrick says: "Let's do it."
SpongeBob says: "I always hate going in there!"
Patrick says: "Yeah."
Flying Dutchman says: "Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow."
Flying Dutchman says: "I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion."
Flying Dutchman says: "Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again."
Flying Dutchman says: "Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week."
Flying Dutchman says: "Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen..."
Flying Dutchman says: "Give me back my sock!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Everyone knows I can't eat without it!"
SpongeBob says: "Never!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Okay, then..."
Flying Dutchman says: "Give it to me!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!"
Patrick says: "It would seem we have reached an impasse."
Flying Dutchman says: "Pink one is right."
Flying Dutchman says: "Tell you what."
Flying Dutchman says: "You give me back the sock, and I'll give you..."
Flying Dutchman says: "three wishes."
Patrick says: "Make it five."
Flying Dutchman says: "Four."
Patrick says: "Three."
Patrick says: "Take it or leave it."
Flying Dutchman says: "Okay..."
Flying Dutchman says: "uhh, three."
Flying Dutchman says: "You get three wishes."
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "Three wishes, Pat."
SpongeBob says: "Isn't that great?"
Patrick says: "Wishes?"
Patrick says: "I wish we had known that earlier!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Okay, you got two wishes left."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "You're back!"
Patrick says: "You're back!"
SpongeBob says: "Guess what?"
SpongeBob says: "The Dutchman gave us three wishes!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick used the first one, and I guess I..."
SpongeBob says: "just used the second one."
Squidward says: "Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!"
Patrick says: "Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish..."
Flying Dutchman says: "That's enough!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish."
Flying Dutchman says: "Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and..."
Voting Guy says: "All hands!"
Voting Guy says: "All hands!"
Voting Guy says: "Time to vote!"
Voting Guy says: "It's voting time!"
Patchy says: "Well, that's our cartoon so far."
Patchy says: "Now its time for you to decide how it ends!"
Patchy says: "Who will get the last wish?"
Patchy says: "Will it be Sassy Squidward, Porky Patrick, or Good Ol' SpongeBob?"
Patchy says: "Just dial the number below: 1  But, let's see what Patrick would've wished for if you picked him."
Patchy says: "OK!"
Patchy says: "Roll the tape!"
Patchy says: "Roll the tape!"
Patchy says: "Roll the tape!"
Patchy says: "Roll the tape!"
Patchy says: "Roll the- oh god!"
SpongeBob says: "That's you, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Make your wish."
Patrick says: "Um..."
Squidward says: "Wait, Patrick, listen."
Squidward says: "I do not particularly feel like being trapped here for all eternity."
Squidward says: "Eternity is a very long time..."
Squidward says: "Understand?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you've got to think harder than you've ever thought before."
Patrick says: "Uhh..."
SpongeBob says: "That's not gonna do it!"
SpongeBob says: "Think harder!"
Patrick says: "Uhh..."
Squidward says: "Come on!"
SpongeBob says: "Come on!"
Squidward says: "You can do it!"
SpongeBob says: "You can do it!"
Squidward says: "Come on, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Patrick!"
Squidward says: "Yeah!"

Squidward says: "Think really hard!"
SpongeBob says: "Think really hard!"
Squidward says: "Put on your thinking cap!"
SpongeBob says: "Put on your thinking cap!"
Patrick says: "Uhh..."
Patrick says: "Okay!"
Patrick says: "I've got it."
Flying Dutchman says: "Thy wish is granted."
Squidward says: "You wished for gum?"
Patrick says: "Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!"
Each take a piece of gum. Later, we see the Flying Dutchman with a big belly while everyone is begging for out.
Flying Dutchman says: "Ahh, minty."
Patchy says: "Heh heh heh."
Patchy says: "That Patrick shivers me timbers right down to my peg leg!"
Patchy says: "Ha ha ha!"
Patchy says: "You were right not to pick that one kids!"
Patchy says: "Seemed like a lot of nonsense to me!"
Patchy says: "Malarkey!"
Patchy says: "Oh well, let's take a look at the other loser!"
Patchy says: "Heh heh heh!"
Patchy says: "It appears you didn't vote for Squidward!"
Patchy says: "I don't blame you, I wouldn't have either."
Patchy says: "But, let's see what would happen if the Old Dutchman's Meeny-Miney-Mo finger landed on Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, you get a wish!"
SpongeBob says: "A great big wish!"
Squidward says: "That's right!"
Squidward says: "And you know what I wish?"
Patrick says: "No!"
Squidward says: "I wish that I had never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!"
Flying Dutchman says: "So be it."
SpongeBob says: "Hi there, I don't believe we've met."
SpongeBob says: "My name is SpongeBob, and this is my associate Patrick."
Patrick says: "Hi."
Squidward says: "That's not what I meant!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Well, now that introductions are out of the way, it's time for dinner."
SpongeBob says: "And what did you say your name was?"
Squidward says: "I'm Squidward."
Squidward says: "I'm your neighbor."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, nice to meet you, Squid-ward."
Patchy says: "And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, So get ready to blow milk out of your nose because it's time to announce..."

Patchy says: "Well, what do you know?"
Patchy says: "The winner is..."
Patchy says: "SpongeBob!"
Patchy says: "Hey, Potty, do you smell something?"
Patchy says: "Oh, Potty!"
Patchy says: "That fuse in your head!"
Patchy says: "I told you we're not doing that stunt!"
Potty says: "Brawk, I didn't get the memo!"
Potty says: "Brawk!"
Patchy says: "And now, the most requested ending!"
Patchy says: "Hooray!"
Squidward says: "Now, think, SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "We're about to get eaten."
Squidward says: "What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I've got it all figured out."
SpongeBob says: "He won't be able to eat us because..."
SpongeBob says: "I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian!"
SpongeBob says: "Hooray!"
Patrick says: "Hooray!"
Squidward says: "Hooray!"
SpongeBob says: "We're home!"
Patrick says: "You did it, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "We're safe!"
Squidward says: "But why have we been turned into fruits?"
Flying Dutchman says: "Hey, I get a wish, too."
Flying Dutchman says: "Fruit prevents scurvy!"
Patchy says: "Just don't let it go to your head!"
Patchy says: "Well, say good night to the folks, Potty!"
Patchy says: "Potty!"
Potty says: "Squawk!"
Potty says: "I quit!"
Potty says: "I quit!"
Patchy says: "Well, that's it folks."
Patchy says: "Right now, I've got a little "employee management" to take care of."
Patchy says: "Oh, Potty!"
Patchy says: "Potty, get in your nice cage!"
Potty says: "Brawk!"
Potty says: "I don't think so!"
Narrator says: "And so, we conclude SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special."

SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "The sky had a baby!"
Squidward says: "That's not a baby!"
Squidward says: "That's a giant anchor!"
Squidward says: "Now go away!"
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "The sky had a baby!"
SpongeBob says: "I know!"
SpongeBob says: "What do you think we should name it?"

Squidward says: "Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind."
SpongeBob says: "I don't know, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "That ship has a spooky green glow around it."
Squidward says: "That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place."
SpongeBob says: "Squid, wait!"
Squidward says: "All right, who owns this crate?"
SpongeBob says: "Doesn't this place seem familiar?"
Patrick says: "I don't know."

SpongeBob says: "Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all?"
Squidward says: "I never said that."
Flying Dutchman says: "Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!"
SpongeBob says: "No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship."
Squidward says: "Ow."
Flying Dutchman says: "You're next!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Welcome back!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Welcome back!"

Patrick says: "I don't get it."
