Following the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song, the brief opening titles show the names of creator Stephen Hillenburg credited as "Hilleburg" in the "written by" section, Derek Drymon, and others. The episode opens with a bubble transition, and we see a coral reef under the sea. The camera zooms to initiate parallax scrolling, which reveals the city of Bikini Bottom. It continues zooming to show a brown rock, a Moai head, and a pineapple, which each contain inhabitants.
