SpongeBob says: "Krabs, what 'cha doin'?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh ahoy, SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I was just using some old toothpaste I found to patch up this small hole in the wall."
Squidward says: "Good thing you didn't hire a professional to do that."
Mr. Krabs says: "And why is that, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Because then you'd only get to repair it once."
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs both blink.
SpongeBob says: "So, what flavor is it?"
Mr. Krabs says: "It-it-it's just a hole in the wall, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "It doesn't have a flavor."
SpongeBob says: "No, I mean the toothpaste!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well I think it's..."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, look, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"

Frank says: "Hey, you guys put in a drive thru!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We did?"
Frank says: "Great, I'll have three large Krabby Patties, Krabby Fries, a Krabby Cola, and two extra large orders of Krabby Rings."
Frank says: "Is this toothpaste?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Boy, I don't know how I think think of this stuff, but I think I got a winner!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We are putting in a drive thru!"
SpongeBob says: "A drive--- whoa!"
Squidward says: "Sounds like a lot of extra work to me."
Mr. Krabs says: "You mean for you."
Squidward says: "It'll cost you money."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, nonsense, we'll build it for free!"

SpongeBob says: "Hi, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ahoy, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "What's with all the booty?"
SpongeBob says: "I got this microphone system so we can hear what the customers order, this neat sign with a menu on it, and this colorful arrow so they know where to go."
SpongeBob says: "It even lights up, see?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, that's great SpongeBob, but I already got a bunch of stuff that's better: A menu board made with old napkins and packing tape, a microphone I made with some rusty tin cans I found, and this sign..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I made from an old noodle."
SpongeBob says: "I don't get it, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "How is this stuff better than the things I bought?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm sorry, what?"
SpongeBob says: "How is this stuff better?"
