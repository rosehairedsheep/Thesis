Mr. Krabs says: "Where could they be?"
Mr. Krabs says: "They should've been here hours ago!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Arrgh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Not a customer in sight."
Mr. Krabs says: "If I don't make any money today, I'll surely break out in a rash!"
SpongeBob says: "Yippee!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm rich!"
SpongeBob says: "Look, Patrick, eight gold doubloons!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait, I saw it first!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hyah!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Mine, mine!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Boy, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, you sure are sweaty."
Mr. Krabs says: "What's this?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Where are the doubloons?"
SpongeBob says: "There are no real doubloons, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"

Patrick says: "Based on a real treasure map."
SpongeBob says: "Take a break and play around with us."
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
Patrick says: "C'mon, sweaty."
Mr. Krabs says: "Have you finished cleaning the tables?"
SpongeBob says: "I cleaned the tables, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Aye, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?"
SpongeBob says: "I already took care of it."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ha ha ha."
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, lads."
Mr. Krabs says: "Looks like you've shanghaied me."
Patrick says: "My turn."
Patrick says: "It's off to jail for you, Mr."
Patrick says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Patrick, you're fired!"
Patrick says: "But I don't even work here!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Would you like a job, starting now?"
Patrick says: "Boy, would I?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're fired!"
SpongeBob says: "My turn."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I see Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs' zipper is undone."
Mr. Krabs says: "Shiver me timbers!"
SpongeBob says: "Just kidding, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I'm almost to the treasure."
SpongeBob says: "Your turn again, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ooh, fish eyes."
Mr. Krabs says: "1, 2."
SpongeBob says: "You are a real pirate."
SpongeBob says: "Go straight to the "X" that marks the spot."
SpongeBob says: "You get to dig for treasure, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Treasure?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs is getting all sweaty again."
Fred says: "My leg!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Can't you see we're closed?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ready for another round?"
Mr. Krabs says: "This is my kind of game!"
SpongeBob says: "Hooray!"

Mr. Krabs says: "6!"
Mr. Krabs says: "1, 2..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I win again!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, that's 17 times in a row."
SpongeBob says: "I think we ought to call it a night, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I really got to get some sleep."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, you can't walk out on me now."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Come on, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "One more game."
Mr. Krabs says: "I can smell the treasure."
Mr. Krabs says: "Wind is perfect, the tide is right."
Mr. Krabs says: "Let's hunt for treasure."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, you gotta..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Tread softly, lad."
Mr. Krabs says: "If the Dutchman hears you, we'll never get his treasure."
SpongeBob says: "But, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs..."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll roll for you, boy."
SpongeBob says: "But, Mr..."
Mr. Krabs says: "8 paces, north, that's a good start, lad."
SpongeBob says: "But, Mr..."
Mr. Krabs says: "1, 2, 3..."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "I wanna go to bed!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?"
Mr. Krabs says: "A game."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's..."
Mr. Krabs says: "right."
Mr. Krabs says: "Of course it is, my mistake."
Mr. Krabs says: "I guess I got a little carried away, eh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Though it is treasure we're dealing here."
Mr. Krabs says: "Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad."
Mr. Krabs says: "Avast!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Pineapple, ho."
Mr. Krabs says: "Heave two, and prepare to be boarded."
SpongeBob says: "Aw, go home already."
SpongeBob says: "I'm done playing that game, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Thatâ€™s Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game."
Mr. Krabs says: "We're gonna be pirates."
SpongeBob says: "Pirates?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Aye!"
Mr. Krabs says: "How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?"
SpongeBob says: "We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!"
Patrick says: "We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ay, ay, ay."
Mr. Krabs says: "Belay that skipping."
Mr. Krabs says: "Pirates don't skip."
Mr. Krabs says: "Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya."
Mr. Krabs says: "Arrgh."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Look!"
SpongeBob says: "Peg legs and eye patches."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, don't you feel more like pirates?"
SpongeBob says: "Ow."
Mr. Krabs says: "Arrgh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Keep a sharp lookout, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "According to the map, we're close to the first landmark."
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
SpongeBob says: "Can we see the map?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "no!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Only the captain can lay eyes on the map."
SpongeBob says: "Okie dokie, then."
Mr. Krabs says: "Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, "okie dokie, then."
Mr. Krabs says: "" A pirate says, "arrgh!"
SpongeBob says: "Okie..."
SpongeBob says: "oops."
SpongeBob says: "Captain, we're about to hit..."
SpongeBob says: "uhh..."
SpongeBob says: "I mean..."
SpongeBob says: "arrgh, Capt."
SpongeBob says: ", arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Out with it man, arrgh!"
Patrick says: "I, arrgh, think, arrgh, he's trying, arrgh, to say..."
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "land..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Arrgh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "From now on, only the captain says, arrgh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Status report, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "SquarePants?"
SpongeBob says: "The whole ship is underwater captain."
Mr. Krabs says: "Arrgh, we're marooned then."
Mr. Krabs says: "Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot."
Mr. Krabs says: "This is it, boys, from the seaweed with 2 leaves on it."
Mr. Krabs says: "10,000 paces east."
SpongeBob says: "But, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, that seaweed has..."
SpongeBob says: "Which way, cap'n?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ensign Patrick, which way is east?"
Patrick says: "Uhh..."
Patrick says: "let's see, uhh..."
Patrick says: "that way, captain!"
Mr. Krabs says: "9,997..."
Mr. Krabs says: "9,998..."
Mr. Krabs says: "9,999..."
Mr. Krabs says: "10,000!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Where's the "X"?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Supposed to be right here!"
Mr. Krabs says: "10,000 paces east."
Patrick says: "Ooh!"
Patrick says: "East?"
Patrick says: "I thought you said "weast"!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Weast?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What kind of compass you reading, lad?"
Patrick says: "This one, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's west, Patrick."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're fired again."
Mr. Krabs says: "9,551..."
Mr. Krabs says: "9,552..."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, we're tired."
Patrick says: "And hungry."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ooh."
Mr. Krabs says: "So this is my crew."
Mr. Krabs says: "You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home."
Mr. Krabs says: "Arrgh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That sickens me."
Mr. Krabs says: "A pirate is not judged by the notches in his cutlass, or by the size of his booty."
Mr. Krabs says: "A pirate is judged by the loyalty of his crew."
Mr. Krabs says: "And without a loyal crew..."
Patrick says: "Don't cry, Captain Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "You'll stay with me then?"
SpongeBob says: "We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!"
Patrick says: "We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I knew I could count on you boys."
Mr. Krabs says: "One for all!"
SpongeBob says: "And all for one!"
Patrick says: "And all for one!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent."
Patrick says: "I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks."
SpongeBob says: "But we've only been gone a few hours."
Patrick says: "I know."
SpongeBob says: "I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure."
SpongeBob says: "Let's go see if the captain will go now!"
SpongeBob says: "Captain Krabs?"
Patrick says: "Captain Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "He's not here."
Patrick says: "Look!"
Patrick says: "The treasure map."
SpongeBob says: "Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Yeah..."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what are you doing?"
Patrick says: "Nothing."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map."
Patrick says: "I'm not looking, I'm touching."
Patrick says: "There's no rule against that, is there?"
SpongeBob says: "No, guess there isn't."
SpongeBob says: "The map, the map, gotta see it, gotta look at it."
Patrick says: "The map, the map, gotta see it, gotta look at it."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah?"
Patrick says: "Did you notice something familiar about this map?"
SpongeBob says: "You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Do you think this is a problem?"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
Patrick says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Patrick says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Sneaking peeks at me treasure map?"
Patrick says: "We're sorry."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's mutiny on my ship."
Mr. Krabs says: "So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?"
SpongeBob says: "Not at all, Captain Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "We don't think that at all!"
Patrick says: "I think that."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!"
SpongeBob and Patrick both begged in mercy and then the "X" symbol appeared underneath them.
SpongeBob says: "Look!"
SpongeBob says: "It's the "X"."
Mr. Krabs says: ""X" marks the spot!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "That game really is based on a real treasure map."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, what are you waiting for, lads?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig."
SpongeBob says: "We got it, Captain Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ha, ha."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hand it up to me, lads."
Mr. Krabs says: "Heave!"
Female Chorus says: "The Dutchman's Treasure!"
All says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "I don't know."
Patrick says: "How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What shares?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're not getting any of my treasure!"
SpongeBob says: "We found it together."
SpongeBob says: "So we deserve a share!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, I'm the captain."
Mr. Krabs says: "And I say it's mine!"
SpongeBob says: "What about loyalty?"
Mr. Krabs says: "All for one."
SpongeBob says: "And one for all."
Mr. Krabs says: "All for one."
SpongeBob says: "And one for all."
Mr. Krabs says: "All for one."
SpongeBob says: "And one for all."
Flying Dutchman says: "I'm the Flying Dutchman."
Mr. Krabs says: "All for one."
SpongeBob says: "And one for all."
Flying Dutchman says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "All for one."
SpongeBob says: "And one for all."
Patrick says: "And one for all."
Flying Dutchman says: "Who dug up the Dutchman's treasure?"
Mr. Krabs says: "They did!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Arrgh!"
Flying Dutchman says: "So you two scallywags dug up me treasure?!"
Flying Dutchman says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh-huh!"
Patrick says: "Uh-huh!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did."
Flying Dutchman says: "So here's an reward for the two of ya's."
The Flying Dutchman giving them couple of gold doubloons.
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
Female Chorus says: "Two gold doubloons!"
SpongeBob and Patrick take the doubloons and the Flying Dutchman puts away his treasure chest in his pocket.
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm captain of this crew!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Where's my reward?"
Flying Dutchman says: "Hmmm, I guess you're right."
Flying Dutchman says: "A little something for your trouble."
Mr. Krabs says: "Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest!"
Female Chorus says: "Plastic!"
Flying Dutchman says: "Aye, but it's based on a real treasure chest."
Patrick says: "Gee, Mr."
Patrick says: "Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again."
Flying Dutchman turns into green smoke and vanishes.
