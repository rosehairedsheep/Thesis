SpongeBob says: "How will that help them chew faster?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, what's the problem?"
SpongeBob says: "No problem, I was just telling this customer he needed to wait for his favorite table."
Orange customer says: "Five bucks if I get the table now."
Mary says: "Ow, my hip."
Mr. Krabs says: "Enjoy your meal."
Mr. Krabs says: "Let me know if you need anything else."
SpongeBob says: "Why did you give him the table?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You know what they say: "Money Talks."
SpongeBob says: "I didn't know money could talk."
SpongeBob says: "Did it tell you to kick those old people out?"
SpongeBob says: "What do you have against old people?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't go goofy on me, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Money can't really talk."
Mr. Krabs says: "Only fish can talk."

Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, if you could tell me what you want, how happy we would be."
Mr. Krabs says: "We'd surely be the best of friends, we'd never disagree."
Mr. Krabs says: "There wouldn't be a downside, not one that I could see."

Mr. Krabs says: "Who said that?"
Nickel says: "Down here."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, it's a nickel."
Mr. Krabs says: "What were you doing in my belly button, little fella?"
Nickel says: "I got stuck in there during your last coin shower."

Dime says: "What's wrong with us?"
Money says: "Yeah!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Nothing, nothing."
Mr. Krabs says: "You guys are great."
Mr. Krabs says: "I thought you guys might want some company, you know, to make you happy."
Money says: "Why don't you ask what would make us happy?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, so how can I make you happy?"
Money says: "Spend us!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
Dime says: "We're money."
Dime says: "It's in our nature."

Money says: "Spend us."
Mr. Krabs says: "I can't spend all of you."
Mr. Krabs says: "And none of you want to be spent on stuff I want."
Money says: "Spend us."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ah, you're all shallow and self-absorbed."
Mr. Krabs says: "What did I ever see in you?"

Mr. Krabs says: "I want a refund."
Flying Dutchman says: "All sales are final from the Flying Dutchman, especially for a selfish shellfish like yourself."
Flying Dutchman says: "Try saying that three times fast."
Flying Dutchman says: "Your soul's going into me fanny pack of despair."
Flying Dutchman says: "?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hehe, yeah, well, I sort of sold my soul already."
Flying Dutchman says: "What?"
Flying Dutchman says: "To who?"
Mr. Krabs says: "To those guys."
Monster says: "We were here first, pops."
