SpongeBob says: "Hit it one more time Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Don't want anyone stealing it."
SpongeBob says: "Good job, Patrick."
Squidward says: "All right, what's going on out here?"
Squidward says: "I can't even hear myself think!"
Patrick says: "Oh!"
Patrick says: "Ooh!"
Patrick says: "Can you smell yourself think?"
Patrick says: "Or see?"
Squidward says: "No!"
Patrick says: "How, how about taste?"
Patrick says: "Can you taste yourself think?"
Squidward says: "Shut it!"
Squidward says: "What are you two dingbats doing?"
SpongeBob says: "We were just posting Patrick's new "For Rent" sign."
SpongeBob says: "We worked on it all morning, see?"
Squidward says: "For rent?"
Squidward says: "You mean one of you is moving out?"
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick here is just gonna rent out his front yard."
Patrick says: "Need a little extra cash if you know what I mean."
Squidward says: "Wow!"
Squidward says: "To think this day started off so horribly and now..."
Squidward says: "What do you mean you're just gonna rent out your front yard?"
Patrick says: "First come, first, serve."
Squidward says: "Oh great, now another idiot can move in."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Squidward, that reminds me."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick and I are off to Jellyfish Fields for the day."
SpongeBob says: "We were wondering if maybe you can stick around and keep an eye out for any takers."
Squidward says: "Oh, I would love to."
Squidward says: "Just let me check my planner."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, thanks!"
Squidward says: "Oh no, I'm sorry, I can't."
SpongeBob says: "Aww, why not?"
Squidward says: "It's because I was planning to do "No such thing"!"
Squidward says: "See?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, well thanks anyway, Squidward."
Patrick says: "Yeah, thanks."
Squidward says: "With those two bone bags gone, I now have enough time for some peace and..."
Squidward says: "Hmmm."
Squidward says: "I wonder who was making all that noise."
Howard says: "Hello."
Howard says: "My name is Howard."
Squidward says: "Hello, Howard."
Howard says: "I noticed this "For Rent" sign."
Howard says: "Is this yard still for rent?"
Squidward says: "Sorry, you're too late."
Howard says: "Hmmm."
Howard says: "Howard is disappointed."
Squidward says: "Aren't we all?"
Howard says: "I thought this would be the one place to pursue my passions..."
Squidward says: "Passions?"
Howard says: "..."
Howard says: "play the bassoon..."
Squidward says: "The bassoon?"
Howard says: "..."
Howard says: "and enjoy a nice cup of tea in my front yard."
Howard says: "Farewell."
Howard says: "I new this was too good to be true."
Squidward says: "I was..."
Squidward says: "just kidding!"
Howard says: "Well, in that case, I should move in right away!"
Howard says: "Make yourself at home."
Squidward says: "Wow, his designs are impeccable!"
Squidward says: "Yes, I do feel "at home"."
Howard says: "I would like to propose a toast—"
Howard says: "to a new neighbor."
Squidward says: "To a new neighbor!"
Howard says: "While we're on the topic, what are the other neighbors like?"
Squidward says: "Oh!"
Squidward says: "Well, they're just like any other neighbors."
Howard says: "That's neat."
Howard says: "I'm the neighbor that likes all kinds of neighbors!"
Squidward says: "Well, that's nice!"
Howard says: "Well, as long they aren't jellyfishers."
Howard says: "I can't stand anyone who jellyfishes."
Howard says: "But, luckily, they're not the worst kind of neighbor."
Squidward says: "Well, that's nice."
Howard says: "That would be the bubble blowers."
Howard says: "Between the jellyfishers and the bubble blowers, I just couldn't stand to stay in my old neighborhood anymore."
Squidward says: "Well, you won't even notice what the neighbors around here are like!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, look!"
Patrick says: "There's a mobile home parked in front of my house!"
SpongeBob says: "Do you know what that means?"
Patrick says: "I'm a landlord!"
SpongeBob says: "All hail the landlord!"
Patrick says: "All hail the landlord!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, what do you say we go knock on the door and meet the new neighbor?"
SpongeBob says: "Great idea."
Squidward says: "Oh no!"
Howard says: "What's going on?"
Howard says: "Is someone out there?"
Squidward says: "Nope, no!"
Squidward says: "There's nobody at all for miles around!"
Howard says: "Are you sure?"
Howard says: "I thought I heard voices."
Squidward says: "Nope, there weren't any voices."
Howard says: "Perhaps it's the other neighbors coming to meet me."
Howard says: "We'd better check."
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "I can't let you do that!"
Howard says: "Well, of course you can."
Howard says: "They're your neighbors, too."
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "You REALLY don't wanna go out there, trust me!"
Howard says: "You're hurting my arm!"
Squidward says: "Oh, sorry."
Squidward says: "I was just wondering if we could..."
Howard says: "Could, what?"
Squidward says: "Um, form a little duet together."
Squidward says: "Just you and me."
Squidward says: "Just the two of us."
Squidward says: "Together."
Squidward says: "You know, me on clarinet and you on bassoon."
Howard says: "Why, that's a splendid idea."
Howard says: "I'll get some sheet music."
Squidward says: "Wonderful!"
Patrick says: "Hey, Did you see the way those curtains jerked shut?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
SpongeBob says: "Our new neighbor must be really shy."
Patrick says: "Maybe we could just came back and meet him later."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, besides, we have more pressing things to attend to—"
SpongeBob says: "like this jellyfish we've befriended and this brand new bottle of bubbles!"
Squidward says: "Phew!"
Squidward says: "That was close."
Howard says: "And a one and a two..."
Howard says: "Perplexing."
Howard says: "I could've sworn I just had this thing tuned."
Squidward says: "Uh, that's me!"
Squidward says: "I think this reed needs replacing."
Squidward says: "Excuse me for a moment!"
Squidward says: "There!"
Squidward says: "Now, where were we?"
Patrick says: "Look!"
Patrick says: "Our new neighbor must be even shyer than we thought!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah."
Howard says: "There it is again."
Squidward says: "I'm back."
Howard says: "What is going on?"
Howard says: "Are you hiding something?"
Squidward says: "Why, Howard, I would never hide anything from you!"
Howard says: "Stand aside!"
Howard says: "Repulsive!"
Howard says: "Somebody's got to stop these bubble blowing jellyfishers!"
Squidward says: "WAIT!"
Squidward says: "Please, Howard, don't go!"
Squidward says: "You're the rain of sunshine I've had in years!"
Howard says: "I'm sorry."
Howard says: "It's too late, Mr."
Howard says: "Tentacles!"
Squidward says: "Oh, Neptune, no!"
Squidward says: "I know I can handle two dunderheads, but I draw the line at three!"
Howard says: "My house!"
Howard says: "I knew it was too good to be true."
Squidward says: "Well, I almost had a decent neighbor."
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "We can cheer you up."
Patrick says: "Go on."
Patrick says: "Pop it!"
Squidward says: "Pop it?"
Squidward says: "Me?"
Squidward says: "Well at this point, what have I got to lose?"
Squidward says: "Jellyfishing bubble blowers!"
