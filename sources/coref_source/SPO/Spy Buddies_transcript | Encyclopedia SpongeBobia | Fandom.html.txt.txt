A shadow that looks like Plankton walks up to the Krusty Krab and gets inside using the code. He goes back into Mr. Krabs' office and opens up the safe and gets out the formula. SpongeBob turns on the lights to reveal that the shadow is Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Just making sure the Krabby Patty formula is safe."
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton hasn't tried stealing the formula in over a month."
Mr. Krabs says: "He must be planning something big."
Squidward says: "Hello."
Mr. Krabs says: "One of you will have to volunteer for some extra work."
Squidward says: "Goodbye."
Mr. Krabs says: "I was just gonna ask if someone can spy on Plankton."
SpongeBob says: "Spy?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoo-ooh-ooh!"
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob, I can see you through this straw."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I'm going to be a spy."
Patrick says: "You're a spy?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "I wanna be a spy, too!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Shh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, okay!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You can be a spy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Just be quiet."
SpongeBob says: "Hooray, we're spy buddies!"
Patrick says: "Hooray, we're spy buddies!"
SpongeBob says: "Spy buddies."
Patrick says: "Spy buddies."
Mr. Krabs says: "Your instructions are on this Krabby Patty."
Mr. Krabs says: "But remember, the fate of the Krusty Krab rests in your hands, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "In my hands."
SpongeBob says: "Ooh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to discover what Plankton's up to."
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't let him out of your sight."
Mr. Krabs says: "You'll need to rustle up some spy gadgets."
Mr. Krabs says: "If you don't accept it, you're fired!"
SpongeBob says: "Get rid of it!"
SpongeBob says: "Get rid of it, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "That's going to leave a mark."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Sandy."
Sandy says: "Hey, SpongeBob, Patrick."
Sandy says: "What y'all doing?"
SpongeBob says: "Do you know anything about spying, Sandy?"
Sandy says: "Well, I know you need a lot of crazy gadgets like jet-packs and laser-equipped Bermuda shorts with walkie-talkies."
Man on Walkie Talkie says: "10-4, good buddy."
Sandy says: "Cameras that fit up your nose, high-powered magnifying glasses, and my favorite, the knockout ray."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, Sandy, with these gadgets, Patrick and I will be great spies."
SpongeBob says: "What do we do now, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "What's he doing now?"
SpongeBob says: "Nothing yet."
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "He's..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "buying baby clothes?"
SpongeBob says: "We gotta get closer."
Plankton says: "Excuse me?"
Plankton says: "Do you have anything in a size negative five?"
SpongeBob says: "Wow, Plankton has to buy baby clothes?"
Patrick says: "How embarrassing."
SpongeBob says: "SpongeBob to Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Come in Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabs here."
Mr. Krabs says: "Go ahead."
SpongeBob says: "Plankton just bought some baby clothes."
Mr. Krabs says: "Baby clothes?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hmm..."
Mr. Krabs says: "What's he doing now?"
SpongeBob says: "Hold on."
SpongeBob says: "He's buying..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah?"
SpongeBob says: "A..."
SpongeBob says: "stamp."
Mr. Krabs says: "A stamp."
SpongeBob says: "We're right behind him, and he has no idea!"
Plankton says: "Would you stop making all that racket?"
Patrick says: "What's he doing now?"
SpongeBob says: "I can't tell."
Plankton says: "Whew!"
Plankton says: "Gosh, it's hot."
Plankton says: "Ahhhh!"
SpongeBob says: "He's getting away!"
SpongeBob says: "Quick, Patrick, use the jet-pack!"
Patrick says: "Can do!"
Plankton says: "Whew."
Plankton says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Boy, it was lucky the sidewalk broke our fall."
SpongeBob says: "But we've lost Plankton!"
Patrick says: "To the spy mobile!"
SpongeBob says: "Hmmm..."
SpongeBob says: "mines, oil slick, smoke screen, shield..."
Patrick says: "Self destruct!!"
Patrick says: "There's a call coming through on my Pants-A-Phone."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabs to Agent SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "Come in SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "It's for you."
SpongeBob says: "Agent SpongeBob here."
Mr. Krabs says: "You found out what Plankton's up to?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm afraid we've lost him, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, find him, lad."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm not paying you to goof off with Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "You're not paying me at all, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Exactly."
Mr. Krabs says: "So get to work."
Recording says: "If you'd like to make a call, please deposit 25 cents."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Patrick, we're in position."
SpongeBob says: "Now how do we get inside?"
Patrick says: "I think the front door's open."
SpongeBob says: "Spies don't use the front door, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "We've got to figure out a complicated way to get inside."
Patrick says: "This looks like a job for Patrick Star Laser Pants!"
SpongeBob says: "Good work, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Now it's my turn."
Patrick says: "I am."
Patrick says: "You need to be quiet."
Patrick says: "We're on a secret mission."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, I have to go."
SpongeBob says: "Can't you go later?"
Plankton says: "Could I interest you in a raspberry iced tea?"
Patrick says: "No, thank you."
Plankton says: "Or perhaps a bran muffin?"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, I have to go now!"
Plankton says: "Prune Danish?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why's it dark?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I think I put off my cataract surgery too long."
Squidward says: "No, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, it's that time of the month."
Mr. Krabs says: "Man your battle stations!"
Squidward says: "I'm on it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Bring it on, Plankton."
Plankton says: "Oh, I will."
Plankton says: "We'll see if you have any customers left after I pump up the volume."
Nat says: "Oh, brother, I hated the real version of this song."
Mr. Krabs says: "He's driving me customers away!"
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, Plankton, you want my customers so badly?"
Plankton says: "Do your worst, Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "It's up to you and me, buddy!"
Patrick says: "Abandon ship!"
Plankton says: "Pointy-headed projectile on the port side!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ha ha ha!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Not to rain on your parade or anything, but you always lose."
Plankton says: "No, SpongeBob, I always..."
Mr. Krabs says: "..."
Mr. Krabs says: "win!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I stole me own formula!"
SpongeBob says: "But if you're Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, then who's..."
Plankton says: "No, you idiot."
SpongeBob says: "Plankton?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "What the barnacles is going on here?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You see, we had a bet."
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton's been trying for twenty years to steal me formula, and he's never done it!"
Plankton says: "I almost had it thirty-seven times, and you know it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You can't beat me, Plankton."
Mr. Krabs says: "I always win!"
Plankton says: "You've got the easy part."
Plankton says: "I'd like to see you do my job."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, yeah, right."
Mr. Krabs says: "If I was you, I could steal me formula on me first try."
Plankton says: "Ha!"
Plankton says: "The usual wager?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're on."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now pay up."
Plankton says: "Here you go, Eugene."
Plankton says: "One a-dollar."
Patrick says: "Not so fast!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Then who are you?"
Squidward says: "I'm not..."
SpongeBob says: "Hmmm, if he's Squidward, then you must be..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "Sandy?"
Sandy says: "Whoops, wrong outfit."
Patrick says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Nah, I'm just kidding."
Patrick says: "I really am Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Good one, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "There's just one thing I don't understand."
Mr. Krabs says: "What's that, laddie?"
SpongeBob says: "That."
