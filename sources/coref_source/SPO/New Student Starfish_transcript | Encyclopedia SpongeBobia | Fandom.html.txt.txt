Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob, want to go jellyfishing?"
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Patrick, I can't."
SpongeBob says: "I have school today."
Patrick says: "Well, what am I supposed to do all day while you're at school?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know."
SpongeBob says: "What do you normally do while I'm gone?"
Patrick says: "Wait for you to get back."
SpongeBob says: "Wait a second, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Why don't you come to school with me?"
Patrick says: "Hey, that's a great idea!"
SpongeBob says: "You and me in school together as classmates!"
SpongeBob says: "Think about it!"
Patrick says: "Wow."
SpongeBob says: "Brace yourself, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime."
Patrick says: "And no line."
SpongeBob says: "Behold, Patrick, the Hallway Of Learning."
SpongeBob says: "And these are the Lockers Of Learning."
Patrick says: "And these are the Stairs Of Learning, right?"
SpongeBob says: "No, they're just the stairs."
SpongeBob says: "These are the Stairs Of Learning."
Patrick says: "Where is everyone?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know."
SpongeBob says: "Home, probably."
SpongeBob says: "Class doesn't start 'till 9:00."
Patrick says: "6:20?"
Patrick says: "But I thought you said you were late."
SpongeBob says: "Late for being early."
Patrick says: "Hey!"
Patrick says: "When did I start wearing a watch?"
SpongeBob says: "And now, for the room with the most class: the Classroom."
Patrick says: "Ohh."
SpongeBob says: "And this is the chalkboard."
SpongeBob says: "It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain Of Knowledge."
Patrick says: "Ohhh."
Patrick says: "Huh?"
Patrick says: "Uh, sorry."
Patrick says: "Ohhhh!"
SpongeBob says: "There you are."
Patrick says: "But look at all the stars you have."
Patrick says: "I'll never be that good."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, now, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have."
SpongeBob says: "Ahem!"
SpongeBob says: "74."
Patrick says: "Who said that?"
Patrick says: "Was it him?"
SpongeBob says: "I doubt it."
SpongeBob says: "That's Roger, our class science project."
Patrick says: "What does he teach us?"
SpongeBob says: "The greatest lesson of all: the precious value of life."
SpongeBob says: "You see, Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat."
SpongeBob says: "This light bulb represents knowledge."
SpongeBob says: "And without its energy and warmth, within minutes, Roger would die."
Patrick says: "Life!"
Patrick says: "Death!"
Patrick says: "Life!"
Patrick says: "Death!"
Patrick says: "Life!"
Patrick says: "Death!"
Patrick says: "Life!"
Patrick says: "Death!"
Patrick says: "Life!"
Patrick says: "Death!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher."
SpongeBob says: "Think you can handle the second chair?"
Patrick says: "I'm learning!"
SpongeBob says: "This is gonna be great!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Hello, class, my name is Mrs."
Mrs. Puff says: "Puff."
Mrs. Puff says: "And the only reason I say that I see we have a new student."
Mrs. Puff says: "Young man, why don't you stand up and introduce yourself?"
Patrick says: "Who's the fat kid talking to?"
SpongeBob says: "You, Patrick, she's the teacher."
Patrick says: "Oh."
Mrs. Puff says: "Come on now, tell the class your name."
Mrs. Puff says: "Don't be nervous."
Patrick says: "Uh..."
Patrick says: "uh..."
Mrs. Puff says: "We just want to know your name."
Patrick says: "Uh..."
Patrick says: "uh..."
Patrick says: "uh!"
Patrick says: "..."
Patrick says: "24!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Oh, great, another genius..."
Patrick says: "Why are they laughing?"
SpongeBob says: "I guess it's just in the timing."
Patrick says: "Oh."
Mrs. Puff says: "Today's first lesson will be on turning."
Patrick says: "24."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick."
Patrick says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "I thought of something funnier than 24."
Patrick says: "Let me hear it."
Mrs. Puff says: "That's enough!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Young man, this is your first day, so I'll let you off with a warning."
Mrs. Puff says: "As for you, SpongeBob, I expect more from a good noodle."
Mrs. Puff says: "Pay attention."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Mrs."
SpongeBob says: "Puff."
Mrs. Puff says: "Now then, "Turning"; what every driver should know."
Mrs. Puff says: "When you are turning, it is important to signal at least..."
SpongeBob says: "Big Fat Meanie?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you can't do that!"
SpongeBob says: "She's the teacher!"
Mrs. Puff says: "What about the teacher?"
SpongeBob says: "No..."
Mrs. Puff says: "I'm sorry, SpongeBob, but if one wishes to be a good noodle, one must behave like a good noodle."
SpongeBob says: "I'm a good noodle!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm a good noodle!"
Mrs. Puff says: "You'll get this star back when you earn it."
Patrick says: "Mrs."
Patrick says: "Puff, is it naptime?"
Mrs. Puff says: "SpongeBob, I've had enough of your nonsense."
Mrs. Puff says: "Now collect your things and move to the available desk in the back of the room!"
SpongeBob says: "What, me?"
SpongeBob says: "But why?"
Mrs. Puff says: "Because the Big Fat Meanie said so."
Mrs. Puff says: "Now go!"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks a lot, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Sure thing, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here."
SpongeBob says: ""Skool is 4 Chumps"?"
SpongeBob says: "Where am I?"
Patrick says: "Psst, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Just ignore him, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, over here."
SpongeBob says: "Whatever you do, don't look at him."
Patrick says: "Psst, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob?"
Patrick says: "Psst, over here."
Patrick says: "I'm trying to tell you something."
Patrick says: "Something important."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Patrick says: "Hi."
Mrs. Puff says: "Perhaps this would be a good time for recess."
Patrick says: "Hey, buddy."
Patrick says: "Funny stuff in there, funny stuff."
SpongeBob says: "There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "You got me in trouble!"
SpongeBob says: "You got me moved to the back of the room!"
SpongeBob says: "You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars!"
Patrick says: "Who cares about a stupid star?"
SpongeBob says: "Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, considering you are one!"
Patrick says: "I'll deal with you after class!"
SpongeBob says: "It is after class!"
Patrick says: "I don't see anyone fighting, do you?"
SpongeBob says: "They're talking about us!"
SpongeBob says: "We're fighting!"
Patrick says: "Well, don't mind if I do!"
Student says: "This is embarrassing."
Mrs. Puff says: "Well?"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob and I were fighting."
Mrs. Puff says: "to detention!"
SpongeBob says: "Detention!"
SpongeBob says: "?"
Mrs. Puff says: "May Neptune have mercy on your souls."
SpongeBob says: "I hate you, Patrick."
Patrick says: "I hate you more."
SpongeBob says: "I'd hate you no matter what."
Patrick says: "Yeah, well, I'd hate you even if I didn't hate you."
SpongeBob says: "I'd hate you even if that made sense."
Patrick says: "I'd hate you even if you were me."
Patrick says: "That's how much I hate you."
SpongeBob says: "I'd hate you, even if, uhh..."
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob bites his lip and starts shivering. He glances over at Patrick. Patrick is sitting at his desk about to cry.
Patrick says: "Ohh..."
Patrick says: "Hmph."
SpongeBob watches Patrick, surprised, then does the same. But then he sees Roger's egg shivering in his tank and really starts to panic. We then see that it's snowing in Roger's tank. Snow is piled up around Roger, who is shivering under a pile of snow. Sleigh bells jingle in the background.
SpongeBob and Patrick begin to quietly sob. The camera closes-up on SpongeBob, then Patrick. Finally, unable to take it anymore, SpongeBob turns around in his desk.
SpongeBob says: "Mmmm..."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry I called you a stupid star!"
Patrick says: "I'm sorry I got you in trouble and got you moved to the back of the class and got your Good Noodle Star removed and shot the spitballs..."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry your apology is so long!"
Patrick says: "Me too!"
Patrick says: "Let's save Roger!"
SpongeBob says: "I'll keep him warm and you get a light bulb from the supply closet."
Patrick says: "I'm coming, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, where's Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Aw, forget it."
SpongeBob says: "I've got to go find Roger some warmth."
SpongeBob says: "The light bulb!"
SpongeBob says: "Without its warmth, Roger will die!"
Patrick says: "Roger!"
Patrick says: "Without him, the light bulb will have nothing to warm!"
SpongeBob says: "We did it, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "We saved Roger's life!"
Mrs. Puff says: "I saw the whole thing from behind my one-way chalkboard, and I couldn't be happier with your teamwork."
Mrs. Puff says: "I've decided to give you each one gold star."
Mrs. Puff says: "Although I'm not sure what saving an egg has to do with Boating School."
Patrick says: "Boating School?"
Patrick says: "I thought this was Spanish class."
Patrick says: "See ya, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "See ya, Big, Fat Meanie."
Roger says: "Hey, what'd I miss?"
