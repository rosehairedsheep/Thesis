SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "All right, I'll bite."
Squidward says: "What is it, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Do you know what today is?"
Squidward says: "Annoy Squidward Day?"
SpongeBob says: "Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, don't you know that award's a scam?"
SpongeBob says: "What do you mean?"
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs gives you that award, so you'll work harder for no extra money."
SpongeBob says: "That is not true, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "He gives it to me because I work harder."
SpongeBob says: "You could win it too if you tried harder."
Squidward says: "Oh, for what?"
Squidward says: "To get my face on the Wall of Shame?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, you've got it all wrong."
SpongeBob says: "Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile."
Mr. Krabs says: "Thattaboy, SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "This is going to be a tough one though!"
Mr. Krabs says: "There's no clear cut winner!"
Mr. Krabs says: "There might be a new face on the wall this month."
Squidward says: "That's right, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "I might sneak up on you."
SpongeBob says: "Nooo!"
Squidward says: "What are you doing?"
SpongeBob says: "Making..."
SpongeBob says: "Krabby Patties?"
Squidward says: "You're losing it!"
Squidward says: "Don't you know that award is a load of--..."
Squidward says: "garbage."
SpongeBob says: "Please don't tell Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs about this!"
SpongeBob says: "It'll hurt my chances of winning the award!"
Squidward says: "I already told you, that award is a bunch of..."
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "baloney!"
SpongeBob says: "That is not true, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Like this hat, that award is a symbol of..."
SpongeBob says: "No, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "And this is a symbol of what I think of the 'Employee of the Month' award!"
Squidward says: "Ow!"
SpongeBob says: "An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat."
Squidward says: "I'm telling you for the last time, that award is nothing but a joke!"
SpongeBob says: "What if Squidward's right?"
SpongeBob says: "What if the award is a phony?"
SpongeBob says: "Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob Picture says: "Stow that kind of talk, sailor!"
SpongeBob Picture says: "This is war now, private!"
SpongeBob Picture says: "That's exactly what he wants you to think!"
SpongeBob Picture says: "This is no time to go lily-livered on us!"
SpongeBob Picture says: "There's no room for "buts" in war, soldier!"
SpongeBob Picture says: "He wants you to crack!"
SpongeBob Picture says: "He's trying to trick you, get inside your mind!"
SpongeBob Picture says: "You will stop at nothing--and I mean nothing--to defeat him!"
SpongeBob Picture says: "Have I made myself clear, private?"
SpongeBob says: "Crystal, sir!"
SpongeBob Picture says: "Good!"
SpongeBob Picture says: "Now move out!"
SpongeBob says: "I won't let Squidward win!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "What are you doing here?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "You can't win that award if you don't get up for work!"
Squidward says: "Stop it, SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "If I really wanted that award, I could win it with my tentacles tied!"
SpongeBob says: "That can be arranged."
Squidward says: "You're a lunatic, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Maybe so, but I did win 'Employee of the Month' 26 months in a row."
Squidward says: "Are y-Are you trying to say that you are better than me?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I've been better than you 26 months--and it'll be 27 tomorrow."
Squidward says: "Oh, that's it, square-for-brains!"
Squidward says: "That's it!"
Squidward says: "I'm gonna show you how easy it is to win that award."
Squidward says: "I'm gonna be the new 'Employee of the Month'!"
Squidward says: "I will prove to you that I am far more competent than you!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I'm going in early to wax the floors!"
Squidward says: "Don't bother; I'll have done it already by the time you get there!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me!"
Squidward says: "I don't need to sleep!"
Squidward says: "Loser!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, me neither!"
SpongeBob says: "â€¦26-time loser!"
SpongeBob says: "Look at him."
SpongeBob says: "Watchin' me."
Squidward says: "I'm watching you, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "You're not leaving before me."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward, getting sleepy, huh?"
Squidward says: "No, how about you?"
SpongeBob says: "Nope!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Going somewhere?"
Squidward says: "I'm going to wring you dry when I get outta here!"
Squidward says: "Now get me outta here!"
SpongeBob says: "All right, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I'll stop by after work!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Now to get some rest."
SpongeBob says: "Don't wanna look tired for my 'Employee of the Month' photo!"
Squidward says: "That oughta hold him!"
SpongeBob says: "Ha ha ha ha ha."
SpongeBob says: "Hmmm, a Krabby Patty!"
SpongeBob says: "Yow!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Squidward says: "So long, Sponge loser!"
SpongeBob says: "Truce."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, I can't take it anymore."
Squidward says: "If we keep this up, neither of us will win the award!"
SpongeBob says: "You're right."
SpongeBob says: "We should save our energy for work where we really need it."
Squidward says: "Okay, let's have a good clean fight."
SpongeBob says: "And may the better man win."
SpongeBob says: "He's nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!"
Squidward says: "Look at that buck-toothed, corn-fed smile."
Squidward says: "You can't trust him as far as you can throw him."
SpongeBob says: "As soon as he stops shaking my hand..."
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "I'm gonna make a run for it."
SpongeBob and Squidward stop shaking hands, laugh nervously, and hastily run for the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is opening it up.
Mr. Krabs says: "Money, money, gonna make some money!"
SpongeBob says: "Look, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Clean floors!"
Squidward says: "Clean tables, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Clean dishes, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's going on here?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "It's much more efficient to clean dishes this way, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "No!"
Squidward says: "Flowers and chocolate for you, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Look, I'm putting my own money in the register, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Two spatulas to increase productivity, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Faster, SpongeBob, faster!"
Squidward says: "There's nothing to this patty flipping, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs!"
Squidward says: "I'll easily double your output, SpongeHog!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Boys, boys, boys!"
Incidental 42 says: "Hey, free Krabby Patties!"
SpongeBob says: "So, who's the winner of Employee of the Month?"
Squidward says: "Me, me!"
Squidward says: "It's me!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Boys!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Boys, the Krabby Patties!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Boys, wait!"
