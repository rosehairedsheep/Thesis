The episode starts with a live-action shot of Big Ben in London. As "Rule, Britannia" plays, the time on the clock changes to 9 o'clock and it starts chiming. The camera zooms out suddenly, revealing that it is only Squidward's watch.
Squidward says: "Wow, I'm really late again."
Squidward says: "Maybe they'll finally fire me."
Squidward says: "Locked?"
SpongeBob says: "This isn't happening."
SpongeBob says: "This isn't happening!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "The horror, it's unspeakable!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't you see, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "It's closed!"
SpongeBob says: "The Krusty Krab is closed!"
Squidward says: "You mean I got out of bed for nothing?"
SpongeBob says: "The doors are locked."
SpongeBob says: "The doors are locked and we are on the outside."
SpongeBob says: "Outsiders."
SpongeBob says: "What are we going to do, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "There are Krabby Patties inside all alone."
Mr. Krabs says: "Just stand aside, lad, and let me unlock the door."
SpongeBob says: "Gosh, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, we were worried something might have happened to you."
SpongeBob says: "That the world would've been deprived of the greatest food known to man."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, you made me drop me keys."
Mr. Krabs says: "Give me some space, lad."
Mr. Krabs says: "Can't a crab get a little space?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Squidward says: "Harsh."
Mr. Krabs says: "Arrgh, me back!"
SpongeBob says: "Are you hurt, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, good, I thought you were hurt."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, me back."
SpongeBob says: "Poor Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "What are we going to do, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Why do anything?"
Squidward says: "I like the new Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs."
Squidward says: "He yells at you more."
SpongeBob says: "I'm serious, Squidward."
Squidward says: "So am I."
SpongeBob says: "We should get Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs a new mattress and surprise him with it as a gift."
SpongeBob says: "Then we'll never have to be late to work again."
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "You want me to spend my hard earned money on my richer than me skin flint boss?"
Squidward says: "No, thank you."
SpongeBob says: "That's okay, Squidward, you'll warm up to the idea."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for coming with me, Patrick."
Patrick says: "No problem, buddy."
Patrick says: "I always wanted to go to a mattress store."
SpongeBob says: "I've never seen so many mattresses."
Patrick says: "Yeah."
SpongeBob says: "How many do you think there are?"
Patrick says: "10."
SpongeBob says: "Cool."
Employee says: "There's plenty more than that."
Employee says: "Try them out."
Employee says: "Find one you like."
SpongeBob jumps on a mattress, but Patrick shakes his head. Patrick lays down on a mattress, but sinks into it as SpongeBob shakes his head. SpongeBob falls on his back on a rock-hard mattress. Patrick sits in a racecar bed then a crashing sound is heard. SpongeBob sits on a bed with a bunch of needles and the employee holds up a first-aid kit. Finally, Patrick sits on a mattress that rotates in rolling from side to side. Now back at the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing.
Squidward says: "What are you morons doing?"
SpongeBob says: "Making a card for Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "To go with his new mattress."
Squidward says: "Oh, I see."
Squidward says: "You're just kissing up to the boss to make me look bad."
Squidward says: "Well, I won't stand for it."
Squidward says: "Gimme that card."
Squidward says: "There, I signed it for all of us."
Patrick says: "Hey, you didn't even help pay."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, that's okay, as long as Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs is happy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, me back."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, here goes another useless attempt to sleep on me mount less, lumpy mattress."
SpongeBob says: "Surprise!"
Patrick says: "Surprise!"
Squidward says: "Surprise!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Armageddon!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, you?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What in the blue eye scallop are you doing in me bedroom?"
SpongeBob says: "We noticed how miserable you were on your lumpy, old mattress."
Squidward says: "So I suggested we get you a new one."
Patrick says: "I thought it was your idea."
Squidward says: "Don't worry, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, I took care of that personally, too."
Squidward says: "I had it hauled away to the dump."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ya idiot!"
Mr. Krabs says: "All my money was in that mattress!"
Squidward says: "What?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "Haven't you ever heard of a bank?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "No!"
Patrick says: "And we got you a card."
Mr. Krabs says: "Is there money in it?"
SpongeBob says: "Is it serious, doctor?"
SpongeBob says: "Will Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs be alright?"
Doctor #2 says: "Mr."
Doctor #2 says: "Krabs is in a cash-coma."
Doctor #2 says: "Only the return of his money can save his life."
Squidward says: "It was SpongeBob's fault!"
Squidward says: "Getting Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs a new mattress was his idea!"
Patrick says: "I knew it!"
Police Officer says: "Not so fast!"
Police Officer says: "This card says "This was all my idea."
Police Officer says: "Love, Squidward."
Police Officer says: "" If Mr."
Police Officer says: "Krabs doesn't pull through, you're going to jail."
Squidward says: "help you do it myself."
Patrick says: "Wow, he really does care."
Patrick says: "What a dump."
SpongeBob says: "We gotta get in there, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs is counting on us."
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob, isn't that the mattress over there?"
SpongeBob says: "Terrific, Patrick, you found it!"
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "Where?"
Squidward says: "Lemme see."
Squidward says: "Where?"
SpongeBob says: "Over there, Squidward, underneath that really big guard worm."
Squidward says: "Oh, that figures."
Doctor #2 says: "Oh no, this is horrible."
Nurse says: "What is it, doctor?"
Doctor #2 says: "This man has no insurance."
Nurse says: "He'll never be able to afford this room!"
Doctor #2 says: "You're right, nurse."
Doctor #2 says: "Extract the patient to the hallway."
Doctor #2 says: "Stat!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, that's Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs' mattress, alright."
SpongeBob says: "Let's go get it."
Squidward says: "Okay, here's the plan: you two quietly go in there, remove the mattress out from the guard worm without..."
Squidward says: "waking..."
Squidward says: "the worm."
Patrick says: "Why not?"
SpongeBob says: "Because that would be rude, Patrick."
Squidward says: "And nothing's meaner than a junkyard worm."
Squidward says: "He'll eat you alive!"
SpongeBob and Patrick get scared at hearing this revelation.
Patrick says: "Hey, wait a minute, what are you gonna do?"
Squidward says: "Oh, I've got the most important job."
Squidward says: "I'm going to keep watch to make sure it's safe."
Patrick says: "Gee, thanks, buddy."
Squidward says: "My pleasure."
Squidward says: "Now let's get a move on."
SpongeBob says: "Ah, isn't it beautiful, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "You can see everything from up here."
Patrick says: "Wow."
Squidward says: "What are you morons doing?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick, I think I can see our houses from here."
Patrick says: "Where?"
Patrick says: "I can't see them."
SpongeBob says: "Wow."
Patrick says: "Wow."
Patrick says: "Let's do it again."
Squidward says: "What did you idiots do?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Patrick says: "Squidward, what are you doing in there?"
Patrick says: "You were suppose to keep watch!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, and you woke up the guard worm, too!"
Squidward says: "I didn't do it!"
Squidward says: "You blockheads woke..."
Doctor #1 says: "Doctor?"
Doctor #2 says: "Yes, doctor?"
Doctor #1 says: "Regarding your patient, doctor."
Doctor #1 says: "I have come to this conclusion."
Doctor #2 says: "Yes, go on."
Doctor #1 says: "We have to surgically remove him out from in front of the candy machine so I can get to the nutty nut bar."
Doctor #2 says: "Of course."
Doctor #2 says: "Nurse?"
Nurse says: "I'm on it."
SpongeBob says: "Worm-bait to the retriever."
SpongeBob says: "Worm bait to the retriever."
SpongeBob says: "We're in."

SpongeBob says: "Understood."
SpongeBob says: "Out."
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "In!"
Squidward says: "Out."
SpongeBob says: "Understood."
SpongeBob says: "Out."
Squidward says: "Oh, look, you're at the far side of the dump, right?"
SpongeBob says: "Affirmative."
Squidward says: "Good."
Squidward says: "Then make lots of noise to draw the guard worm away from the mattress so I can retrieve it."
SpongeBob says: "Affirmative."
SpongeBob says: "Out."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, that's why he calls himself 'The Retriever'."
Patrick says: "Why are we called 'Worm-bait?"
SpongeBob says: "I dunno."
Squidward says: "And my perfect plan falls into place."
Patrick says: "Uh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "I think I know why our code name is "Worm-bait"."
SpongeBob says: "Nice worm."
SpongeBob says: "Good, kind, gentle worm!"
Patrick says: "Ohh, SpongeBob, he likes your wooden spoon."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, I think you're right, Patrick."
Patrick says: "See if he plays catch."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, see the stick, boy?"
Squidward says: "Coast is clear."
Squidward says: "Squiddy, you are a genius."
Administrator Flotsam says: "Excuse me, doctor."
Doctor #2 says: "Administrator Flotsam, what can I do for you?"
Administrator Flotsam says: "It has come to my attention that your patient, Mr."
Administrator Flotsam says: "Krabs, is outside on the front sidewalk."
Doctor #2 says: "Yes, yes he is."
Administrator Flotsam says: "What were you thinking, man?"
Administrator Flotsam says: "We're trying to run a business."
Administrator Flotsam says: "We can't leave patients on the sidewalk."
Doctor #2 says: "Not to worry."
Doctor #2 says: "Nurse!"
Nurse says: "I'm on it."
Squidward says: "Alright, you two, what's the holdup?"
SpongeBob says: "We feel silly."
Squidward says: "Come on, do it for old man Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "Can you explain the plan again, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Sure, but first, put on this cologne."
Squidward says: "Okay, so you are dressed as choice cuts."
Squidward says: "You go in there and yell "Trick or treat!"
Squidward says: "" The worm will realize he forgot to stock up on Halloween candy, he'll leave to buy some then we take the mattress."
Patrick says: "Gimme that cologne."
Squidward says: "Now get in there!"
SpongeBob says: "Happy Halloween, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "I am not going to get hurt this time."
Patrick says: "That guard worm doesn't look very happy."
SpongeBob says: "Run, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Run like you're not in a coma!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, money."
Mr. Krabs says: "I promise I'll never leave you alone again."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "No, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, it's us!"
Patrick says: "Trick or treat."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, hey, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "I didn't recognize you."
Mr. Krabs says: "Say, why are you two dressed as meat?"
SpongeBob says: "Not just meat, we're choice cuts!"
SpongeBob says: "Right, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Oh, I give up."
Squidward says: "Ahhh!"
Squidward says: "Get away!"
