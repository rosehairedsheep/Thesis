Patchy says: "Yee-haw!"
Patchy says: "Hey kids!"
Patchy says: "Now, you're probably wondering, "Hmm, what's Patchy doing in a cave?"
Patchy says: "" good question, you little..."
Potty says: "Sorry I'm late."
Patchy says: "Potty!"
Patchy says: "Why aren't you wearing your costume?"
Patchy says: "I stayed up all night making it!"
Potty says: "You're wasting your time, old man."
Potty says: "Prehistoric stuff is lame."
Potty says: "Everybody knows the future's where it's at."
Patchy says: "What?!"
Patchy says: "!"
Patchy says: "cool."
Potty says: "No, he doesn't."
Patchy says: "Yes, he does."
Potty says: "Nope."
Patchy says: "He most certainly does."
Potty says: "No, he doesn't."
Patchy says: "Yes, he does!"
Potty says: "No."
Patchy says: "I know for a fact that he does!"
Potty says: "..."
Potty says: "not."
Patchy grunts in anger.
Narrator says: "Meanwhile."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's wrong?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, but I've got this strangest feeling that somewhere a pirate and parrot are arguing about me."
Patchy says: "Does."
Potty says: "Doesn't."
Patchy says: "Does."
Potty says: "Doesn't."
Patchy says: "Does."
Potty says: "Doesn't."
Patchy says: "Does!"
Patchy says: "Uh, look, while we're arguing, why don't you folks go ahead and watch some prehistoric SpongeBob!"
Patchy says: "Roll the cartoon!"
Patchy says: "…does."
Potty says: "Doesn't."
Narrator says: "Ah, dawn breaks over the primordial sea."
Narrator says: "It's here that millions of years ago, life began taking its first clumsy steps out of the darkness, opening its newly- formed eyeballs to stare into the blinding light of intelligence, in order to- Umm..."
Narrator says: "never mind."
Narrator says: "This happened a long time ago."
We pan over to prehistoric Conch street, where three houses similar to SpongeBob's pineapple, Patrick's rock, and Squidward's Easter Island Head, except SpongeBob's house has a fern growing out of the top, Squidward's is more like a monkey-shaped head, and Patrick's has no bamboo weathervane. These are prehistoric homes to the three's cavemen ancestors. In caveman SpongeBob's house, it is one large, empty room with cave drawings of him jellyfishing on the walls and rocks and bones on a shelf above his blanket, which he sleeps under. Back outside, a giant purple dinosaur fish wakes up under a beam of sunlight to gurgle out a call similar to SpongeBob's foghorn alarm clock. The sound waves cause the rock to rattle off a shelf and it falls on the prehistoric sponge's head. Alarmed, Sponge shrieks, but calms down when he notices the rock. He laughs and shoves the rock back on the shelf. He then takes his hide blanket from on the floor and puts it on as a pair of caveman pants. He puts one arm through a sleeve and walks outside of his pineapple, dragging a vine behind him.
SpongeGar says: "Banooga ready!"
SpongeGar says: "Tabonga, Gary."
Prehistoric Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeGar says: "Gary!"
SpongeGar says: "Tabonga!"
SpongeGar walks into the clearing with the vine, and we that it's a leash and he's walking a dinosnail Gary.
Gary says: "Meow."
Leaves behind a long trail of slime. SpongeGar and Gary walk past the primitive tiki lair that holds prehistoric Squidward, who looks out the window to see a path of blue slime on his path.
Squog says: "Huh?"
Squog says: "Grrr..."
He is about to walk outside, but stops.
Squog says: "Wait a minute..."
He imagines himself babbling in anger at Gary, and Gary uses his eyes to smash him into a splattered octopus. Squog raises himself but Gary simply smashes him some more then he jumps over his crushed body and slithers away.
Squog says: "Hmm..."
He runs over and picks up two clubs. He debates with himself over which one to use. He takes the bigger one and walks out chuckling. The club left behind cries. Squog approaches SpongeGar and Gary, who are out in the clearing.
Squog says: "SpongeGar!"
Squog says: "SpongeGar!"
Squog says: "Manaka!"
Squog says: "No tabonga Gary pooga!"
Squog says: "Tabonga as a go o saila!"
Squog says: "Tabonga doo."
Squog says: "Tabonga doo!"
SpongeGar says: "Tabonga doo?"
SpongeGar says: "Hmm..."
SpongeGar says: "Tabonga doo..."
Squog fumes and stamps off, but slips on the snail slime, sliding as if on a "Slip 'n' Slide", screaming for SpongeGar's help. But SpongeGar is too busy pondering the meaning of Squog's demand. Squog slams into caveman Patrick's rock, which opens, revealing Patrick's ancestor sticking to the underside of it as Patrick often does.
Patar says: "Patar!"
He walks over to Squog, who is covered in snail slime, but not sliding any longer.
Patar says: "Hmm..."
Patar says: "Yuk!"
Patar says: "Mowonga!"
Squog gets angry and shakes the slime off himself.
Squog says: "Patar!"
Squog says: "Grrr..."
Patar says: "Squog!"
Patar says: "Patar unga Squog!"
He squeezes him so tightly, that the veins in his arms pop out, and Squog is slightly strangled.
Patar says: "Squog."
Squog says: "Eeek!"
Patar says: "Squog!"
SpongeGar notices Patar.
SpongeGar says: "Patar!"
Patar sees him and lets go of Squog, and Squog passes out onto the ground. The two run up to each other.
Patar says: "SpongeGar!"
Patar says: "SpongeGar!"
SpongeGar says: "Patar."
Squog says: "Pfffffttt!"
Patar and SpongeGar hug.
Squog says: "SpongeGar and Patar no got malonka palinka."
Squog says: "Heh, heh."
Squog says: "Palinka..."
Squog says: "Patar an SpongeGar bawannagog."
Squog says: "No pooca Squog."
Squog says: "Squog tay taila foo."
Squog starts to paint when thunder sounds, and lightning strikes the log. Squog looks out his window and gasps to see that the bubble-blowing log has been ignited in flames, and Patar and SpongeGar have been injured by the lightning.
Squog says: "Patar!"
Squog says: "SpongeGar!"
Both get up and run behind a rock, startled. They peek out from behind it to see the fire. SpongeGar, Squog, and Patar slowly approach it, quaking. Squog sniffs it and sticks his hand into it. His hand burns and he takes it out and screams in pain. He sucks his hand afterwards. SpongeGar and Patar put their hands in.
Both says: "Huh?"
Both says: "Hmmm..."
Both says: "Uh-huh, Uh-huh..."
Both says: "Ahhh..."
Suddenly, both scream, and all three suck their hands. Then, Patrick sniffs his, and turns away from it. Then, he adds salt and gnaws on his hand, then growls and crawls away, thinking that SpongeGar and Squog will eat it. He then gnaws his hand away from SpongeGar and Squog. They don't want it, but they slurp because they’re hungry. SpongeGar sees two plants.
SpongeGar says: "Fongar!"
As he runs over to get them, Squog calls him a protozoa.
Squog says: "Monga."
SpongeGar is walking back when he trips and the plants fly into the fire.
Squog says: "SpongeGar!"
He angrilly speaks gibberish. When he's done, he turns to see that Patar is salting his burnt hand. When Patar goes to bite Squog's hand, Squog smashes his head in with a stick.
Squog says: "Patar!"
Squog says: "Chonga!"
Patar crawls away disappointedly. SpongeGar stares at Squog's stick, the two plants in the fire, then the stick again, then the plants, back and forth. We hear mystical music as he looks at the two faster and faster. Then, we see the four live-action singers in barber-shop garb with gray mustaches. Suddenly, SpongeGar gets an idea.
SpongeGar says: "Aha!"
SpongeGar says: "Squog!"
SpongeGar says: "Squog!"
SpongeGar says: "Nah!"
SpongeGar says: "Nah!"
SpongeGar says: "Nah!"
He slowly impales one of the plants with the stick. He sniffs it and then eats it. He then begins jumping up and down in delight, hooting. Apparently, it tasted good. Squog watches him. Then, SpongeGar offers the other plant to Squog, who hesitantly takes it and eats it. But he ends up liking it, and hoots and jumps up and down as SpongeGar watches. He and SpongeGar then shake hands.
Squog says: "Taila foo, SpongeGar!"
Squog says: "Taila foo!"
Squog says: "SpongeGar na dumbo!"
A speech balloon appears from Squog's mouth with Albert Einstein in it. Later, SpongeGar, Patar, and Squog have a cookout. SpongeGar sticks a marshmallow-like plant through the stick, and roasts it in the fire and eats it. Squog does the same with a piece of coral. Patar toasts a stick and eats it, puncturing his lips.
SpongeGar says: "Patar!"
SpongeGar says: "Uh-uh."
SpongeGar says: "Wa SpongeGar!"
Mr. Krabs' ancestor scuttles by.
Prehistoric Krabs says: "Money!"
Prehistoric Krabs says: "Money!"
Prehistoric Krabs says: "Ooga booga!"
Prehistoric Krabs says: "Money!"
Prehistoric Krabs says: "Money!"
Prehistoric Krabs says: "Money!"
Prehistoric Krabs says: "Money!"
Prehistoric Krabs says: "Money!"
Prehistoric Krabs says: "Ooga boo..."
Prehistoric Krabs says: "Agh!"
Narrator says: "Hooray."
Narrator says: "It looks like our prehistoric pals have just discovered fire, but they will soon learn that when you play with fire, you may get burned."
Narrator says: "Stay tuned."
Patchy says: "I told you prehistoric times were fun!"
Patchy says: "Hey!"
Potty says: "That's nothing, old timer."
Potty says: "Make way for the future."
Robot says: "Greetings."
Robot says: "I am the X-29488."
Robot says: "How may I serve you?"
Patchy says: "Where do you keep getting all this stuff?"
Potty says: "Never you mind, pops."
Potty says: "Let's go see what Cavey thinks."
Robot says: "Attack!"
Robot says: "Attack!"
Patchy says: "Potty!"
Patchy says: "You're ruining me caveman show!"
Robot says: "Attack!"
Robot says: "Attack!"
Narrator says: "Will Patchy ever get control of the special?"
Narrator says: "Welcome back to SpongeBob SquarePants B."
Narrator says: "C."
Narrator says: "Sounds like things have gone from bad to worse for Patchy."
Narrator says: "Let's watch."
Potty says: "This is great."
Patchy says: "Ahoy, glad you're back."
Narrator says: "When we last saw our hungry troglodytes, they just discovered fire."
Narrator says: "How long will it take for them to mess it up?"
Narrator says: "Let's see."
Squog says: "Bolapa."
Squog says: "Ganoga, Patar."
Squog says: "Ganoga, SpongeGar."
Patar says: "Ganoga, Squog."
Patar says: "Ganoga, SpongeGar."
SpongeGar says: "Ganoga, Squog."
SpongeGar says: "Ganoga, Patar."
The three walk back to their houses, but then halt. The three turn and look at the fire. Squog runs over and picks up the fire.
SpongeGar says: "No Squog fwee fwee!"
SpongeGar says: "SpongeGar fwee fwee!"
Squog says: "SpongeGar fagonda!"
SpongeGar shoves Squog. Squog is shocked and sets the log down and shoves him back for revenge. SpongeGar shoves Squog, and Squog whacks him with his club. SpongeGar hits Squog with his own club. The two continue to whack each other with clubs, while Patar retrieves the fire. He hoots excitedly as he runs back to his rock. Patar looks behind him to see if Squog and SpongeGar have caught up, and turns to see SpongeGar and Squog in front of him.
Both says: "Patar!"
Patar screams, throwing the log into the air, where it stays. Squog is about to catch it when SpongeGar jumps on Squog's head and takes it instead.
Squog says: "Grrr..."
Squog says: "Aha."
Squog says: "Huh?!"
Squog says: "!"
Squog says: "Grrr..."
He sees SpongeGar running away with it but he falls victim of another Patar trap and drops the log. Patar grabs it and runs off happily.
SpongeGar says: "Patar!"
SpongeGar says: "Bawana, Patar!"
SpongeGar says: "Bawana."
Patar says: "Patar fwee fwee!"
Squog brings his four tentacles out, causing Patar to trip, and the log flies off. Squog chuckles and runs after the log as it rolls away. Patar joins Squog, all chasing the log again.
Squog says: "Fwee fwee Squog!"
Squog says: "Fwee fwee Squog!"
Patar says: "Patar fwee fwee!"
SpongeGar says: "SpongeGar fwee fwee!"
The three chase it up a cliff, but the log rolls back down and it chases them.
All says: "Fwee fwee go bonga!"
They trip over a vine and the log rolls over them. They continue chasing the log. When it stops rolling, they all tug on it.
SpongeGar says: "SpongeGar fwee fwee!"
Squog says: "Squog fwee fwee!"
Patar says: "Patar fwee fwee!"
The fire is suddenly extinguished by more rain. They all sit on the ground.
SpongeGar says: "Oh, Patar..."
Patar says: "Oh, SpongeGar..."
SpongeGar and Patar cry.
SpongeGar says: "Oh, Patar..."
Patar says: "Oh, SpongeGar..."
Squog says: "Sutaka jakasa!"
Squog says: "..."
Squog says: "Tabonga do."
SpongeGar and Patar roast marshmallows over Squog.
Potty says: "Why the long face?"
Patchy says: "I think you know perfectly well, you little winged vermin."
Patchy says: "All I wanted was to show the nice people how great the cavemen were, but all they got was technology-induced chaos!"
Potty says: "Come back inside."
Potty says: "I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
Patchy says: "You got rid of the robot android cyborg?!"
Patchy says: "!"
Potty says: "Nope, even better."
When worlds collide.
Potty says: "Pretty sweet, eh?"
You can run.
But no can hide.
When worlds collide.
You'll laugh so hard.
You'll swear you've died.
When worlds collide.
Hold my hand.
I'll be your guide.
When worlds collide.
Buckle...buckle...buckle up for the sweetest ride.
And prepare to have your mind blown wide.
When worlds collide.
When worlds collide, it's a curious thing.
Bet you never heard a robot and a caveman sing.
In his metal chest are some working parts.
How is that different from my beating heart?
I'm from the future, and I'm from the past.
But that don't mean this friendship wasn't built to last.
He was made in a lab, and I was born in a cave.
So let me hear you holler for this inter-era rave.
Squidward says: "Future!"
Potty says: "Word."
SpongeTron says: "I am SpongeTron."
You, you, you, you can run.
But no can hide.
When worlds collide Patchy shuts his mouth with his hook. The lighting returns to normal.
Patchy says: "Well, Potty, I guess you were right."
Patchy says: "The future is cool."
Potty says: "Just to show you there's no hard feelings, I got you a present from the prehistoric times."
Patchy says: "Ooh!"
Patchy says: "What is it?"
Patchy says: "A new loincloth?"
Potty says: "No."
Patchy says: "An enlarged forehead?"
Potty says: "No."
Patchy says: "Aww, what is it?!"
Patchy says: "!"
Patchy says: "Well, thanks for watching SpongeBob B."
Patchy says: "C."
Patchy says: ", kids."
