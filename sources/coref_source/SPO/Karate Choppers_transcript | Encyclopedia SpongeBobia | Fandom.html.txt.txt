SpongeBob says: "I love this show!"
Sandy says: "Me too!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi-yah!"
Sandy says: "Hi-yah!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi-yah!"
Sandy says: "Hi-yah!"
Sandy says: "Yah."
SpongeBob says: "Double overhand squirrel knot!"
Sandy says: "I'm gonna get you tomorrow, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "That'll be the day."
Sandy says: "Hello?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Sandy, have you ever heard the one about the squirrel and the tin cans?"
Sandy says: "I don't think so."
SpongeBob says: "Well, it goes like this!"
Sandy says: "No it's not, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "Mmmm, my favorite."
SpongeBob whimpers in fear as a drop of hot sauce hangs over the edge of the bottle and Tom Kenny's face appears on the drop.
Volcano Sauce Drop says: "Eheheheheheh!"
Volcano Sauce Drop says: "By the powers of naughtiness, I command this particular drop of hot sauce to be really..."
Volcano Sauce Drop says: "really..."
Volcano Sauce Drop says: "hot!"
SpongeBob gasps.
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Victory is yours."
Sandy says: "I knew you'd come to your senses, SpongeBob."
Sandy drinks the bottle of hot sauce. While she is doing this, SpongeBob takes out his tongue revealing a label that says "Novelty Toy" and he wraps the fake tongue she was holding around her and spins her.
SpongeBob says: "Yah."
Sandy karate chops SpongeBob far away.
Sandy says: "Hi-yah!"
SpongeBob says: "Curses!"
Fred says: "With extra cheese."
Fred says: "To go!"
Squidward says: "Three patties, four large oyster skins, on the double, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh yeah."
SpongeBob says: "Gotcha!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Squidward says: "I'm going to pretend that didn't happen."
SpongeBob says: "Order up."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "Now are you gonna..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "I was going through some records back in me office and--Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "So, you got the hairpiece after all."
SpongeBob says: "Hi-yah!"
Fred says: "My leg!"
SpongeBob says: "Thought you could sneak up on me at work, did ya?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, you can't!"
SpongeBob says: "â€˜Cause I'm fast, I'm mean, and I can do this!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, ahoy, sir!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What was that?"
SpongeBob says: "But, sir, she snuck up on me."
SpongeBob says: "In my own dojo."
Mr. Krabs says: "Are you on some new allergy medication, boy?"
SpongeBob says: "No, sir."
SpongeBob says: "Just practicing my karate, sir."
SpongeBob says: "Or kara-tay, as some call it."
Mr. Krabs says: "Kara-tay?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You should be making me money-ay!"
Mr. Krabs says: "With your spatu-lae!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now get back to work."
SpongeBob says: "Aye aye, capi-tay."
SpongeBob says: "Nice hairpiece, Squidward."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, did you get those bathrooms mopped yet?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, ma'am."
SpongeBob says: "I mean, sir."
SpongeBob says: "I mean, boss."
SpongeBob says: "I mean, poobah!"
Squidward says: "Go!"
SpongeBob walks into the bathroom with a mop and a bucket in his hands. He hears a sneeze, so he opens a door, but nobody is there.
SpongeBob says: "Hah!"
Mr. Krabs says: "No more."
SpongeBob says: "But, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Shh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "No more of this karate stuff, lad."
Mr. Krabs says: "Or you're fired."
SpongeBob says: "No more karate?"
SpongeBob says: "How am I gonna tell Sandy?"
Sandy says: "Hi-yah!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, wait!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs said I have to give up karate."
SpongeBob says: "No, no."
SpongeBob says: "Really, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "Stop."
SpongeBob says: "No, really!"
SpongeBob says: "Please, stop!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What the?"
SpongeBob says: "Ahh, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What did I just get through telling ye, lad?"
SpongeBob says: "But I, uhh, she..."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, you're fired!"
Sandy says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Eh?"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob?"
Sandy says: "Give him another chance, please?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hmmm."
Sandy says: "Aww, shoot, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "I guess you ain't fibbing."
Sandy says: "this?"
SpongeBob says: "Nothing."
SpongeBob says: "Nothing is fun about that at all!"
Sandy says: "We can find something to do that's almost nine times as fun."
SpongeBob says: "We can?"
SpongeBob says: "I mean, sure we can."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Like we can, uhh."
SpongeBob says: "Woo!"
SpongeBob says: "How much fun was that?"
Sandy says: "Almost some."
SpongeBob says: "I know!"
SpongeBob says: "We can act like plants."
SpongeBob says: "Photosynthesis."
SpongeBob says: "Photosynthesis."
Sandy says: "Wanna go to the park?"
SpongeBob says: "Karate sure is dumb."
Sandy says: "Yeah, you can say that again."
SpongeBob says: "I feel dumb just thinking about it."
SpongeBob says: "Duuuuh!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm stuuuupiiid!"
SpongeBob says: "I like karaaateee!"
SpongeBob says: "Doyeee!"
Sandy says: "You like what?"
SpongeBob says: "Not karate."
Sandy says: "Ha!"
Sandy says: "I don't even know what that is."
SpongeBob says: "Me, too."
SpongeBob says: "I don't know what anything is!"
SpongeBob says: "In fact..."
Fisherman says: "Hi-yah!"
Fisherman says: "Hi-yah!"
SpongeBob says: "For a second, that sounded like."
Sandy says: "Karate?"
SpongeBob says: "Right now?"
SpongeBob says: "I mean, no!"
SpongeBob says: "What is this karate?"
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, what do you want on your sandwich?"
Sandy says: "Karate."
SpongeBob says: "What did you say?"
Sandy says: "Uhh, mustard."
Sandy says: "Mustard!"
Sandy says: "I want mustard on my sandwich."
SpongeBob says: "How many slices of barnacle loaf do you want?"
Sandy says: "One."
Sandy says: "Just one."
SpongeBob says: "One for you!"
Sandy says: "Hmmm?"
SpongeBob says: "And one for me!"
Sandy says: "Ohh, uhh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Hmm?"
Sandy says: "Maybe just one more."
Sandy says: "Uhh, I'm kinda hungry."
SpongeBob brings out the barnacle loaf again.
SpongeBob says: "Sure thing, Sandy."
Sandy says: "SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah?"
Sandy says: "Do you think, umm, do you think I could cut this one?"
SpongeBob says: "Uhh, sure."
Sandy says: "Thanks."
Sandy says: "Hi-yah!"
Sandy says: "Is that enough?"
SpongeBob says: "Maybe just one more."
SpongeBob says: "Or two!"
Sandy says: "Or three!"
SpongeBob says: "Or ten!"
Sandy says: "Ten!"
Sandy says: "Yes, ten!"
Sandy says: "Because we're really hungry!"
SpongeBob says: "Right!"
Sandy says: "Right!"
SpongeBob says: "Right!"
Sandy says: "Right!"
SpongeBob says: "Time for buns!"

SpongeBob says: "And I'll cut the cheese!"
Sandy says: "And, what else should we slice?"
SpongeBob says: "More buns!"
Sandy says: "And lettuce!"
Both says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Phew."
SpongeBob says: "Making sandwiches sure is fun."
SpongeBob says: "Right, Sandy?"
Sandy says: "You're mince meat!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What the barnacle?"
SpongeBob says: "Do you think Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs ever does karate?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Bleuhahugh!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, alright, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "You caught me."
SpongeBob says: "But you know what?"
SpongeBob says: "I just can't help myself."
SpongeBob says: "You're just gonna have to fire me."
Mr. Krabs says: "Fire ya?"
