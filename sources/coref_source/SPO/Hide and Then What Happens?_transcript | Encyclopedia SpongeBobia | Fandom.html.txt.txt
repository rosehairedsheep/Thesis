SpongeBob says: "Hi, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Hi, uh..."
SpongeBob says: "SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob and Patrick stare at each other for about 30 seconds, blinking occasionally.
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Yeah?"
SpongeBob says: "You wanna play hide-and-seek?"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah..."
SpongeBob says: "?"
Patrick says: "Do I have to know what hide-and-seek is in order to play it?"
SpongeBob says: "C'mon, Patrick, quit fooling around!"
SpongeBob says: "We've played hide-and-seek dozens of times!"
Patrick says: "Dozens?"
SpongeBob says: "Thousands!"
Patrick says: "Thousands?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I don't know for sure how many I..."
Patrick says: "Gosh!"
SpongeBob says: "Gosh what?"
Patrick says: "I didn't know hide-and-seek had so much mathematics."
Bubble transition changes the scene.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, it's simple."
SpongeBob says: "And count while the other person runs and hides!"
Patrick says: "Hey, you're peeking!"
SpongeBob says: "I thought you said you didn't know how to play."
Patrick says: "Play what?"
SpongeBob says: "Hide-and-seek!"
Patrick says: "Oh, no, no, no, no, no!"
Patrick says: "I do!"
Patrick says: "I do know how to play!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, good!"
Patrick says: "I- I just have one tiny question."
SpongeBob says: "What's that?"
Patrick says: "What's hide-and-seek?"
SpongeBob says: "You think you're getting it now, Patrick?"
SpongeBob says: "Did you find the sock puppet demonstration to be useful?"
Patrick says: "Hide-and-seek: a game played by two or more players in which one player chosen at random counts aloud to a pre-determined number while the remaining players hide."
Patrick says: "Upon reaching said number, the counting player now embarks on a search for the other players."
Patrick says: "The search continues until all players are located and a winner is determined."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, you really are getting it!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Patrick, come on."
SpongeBob says: "Of course we can play!"
Patrick says: "Oh no!"
Patrick says: "I can't!"
SpongeBob says: "Why can't you?"
Patrick says: "Because..."
Patrick says: "I don't have any socks!"
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick, forget about the socks."
Patrick says: "What socks?"
SpongeBob says: "Never mind, just start counting."
SpongeBob says: "That's perfect!"
SpongeBob says: "Now I'm gonna run and hide."
Patrick says: "Seven, eight..."
SpongeBob says: "Now I'm all over, where am I gonna hide?"
SpongeBob says: "That's definitely one idea."
Patrick says: "Seventy-eight, seventy-nine, a hundred!"
Patrick says: "Four!"
Patrick says: "A-ha!"
Patrick says: "I found you."
Patrick says: "I win, I win, I win!"
Patrick says: "In your face!"
Patrick says: "I must be the best hide-and-seek player ever!"
SpongeBob says: "All right, it's my turn to count."
SpongeBob says: "You know what you're supposed to do right?"
Patrick says: "Of course!"
Patrick says: "I'm the best hide-and-seek player ever aren't I?"
SpongeBob says: "Right."
SpongeBob says: "Here I go."
SpongeBob says: "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight..."
Patrick says: "Do you hear that?"
Patrick says: "No, what is that?"
Patrick says: "Oh, it's SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "Why is he counting?"
Patrick says: "I guess I'll just go home, maybe or later he'll want to play a game, or something."
SpongeBob says: "Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty..."
SpongeBob says: "This is gonna be harder than I thought."
Squidward says: "La da dee, la da dum, la da doo..."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Squidward says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward."
Squidward says: "What?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm playing hide-and-seek with Patrick and I was wondering if I could search for him in your house."
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "See ya, bye."

SpongeBob says: "I thought I'd look for him on this sign."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That makes me furious!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I'll clean it up."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's not that!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's just that you haven't paid the fee."
SpongeBob says: "The fee?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, you know."
Mr. Krabs says: "The Krusty Krab Hide-and-Go Seekers' Fee."
Mr. Krabs says: "For playing hide-and-seek on Krusty Krab premises."
