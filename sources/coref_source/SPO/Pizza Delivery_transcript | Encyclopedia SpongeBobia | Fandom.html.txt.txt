Squidward says: "Krabs..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Our delivery squid will bring it right over."
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, we don't serve pizza."
Squidward says: "We don't deliver."
Mr. Krabs says: "We don't deliver,  but you do."
Squidward says: "Can't you just get SpongeBob to do it?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Great idea!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Take him with you."

Squidward says: "I think we're out of gas."
Squidward says: "And you know what else?"
Squidward says: "We're in the middle of nowhere!"
SpongeBob says: "And you know what else else?"
SpongeBob says: "I think the pizza's getting cold."
Squidward says: "And the pizza's cold?"
Squidward says: "Oh, the pizza's cold."
Squidward says: "Not the pizza!"
Squidward says: "Oh, how could it get any worse?!"

Squidward says: "And my feet are killing me."
Squidward says: "Whoa."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob?"
Squidward says: "What are you doing?"
SpongeBob says: "It's an old pioneer trick."
SpongeBob says: "I saw it in a movie once."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, this is no time for..."
SpongeBob says: "Shh, shh, shh."
SpongeBob says: "It's working."
Squidward says: "What is it?"
Truck Driver says: "Crashin' frashin' break dancers!"
Squidward says: "He's stopping!"
Squidward says: "He's stopping!"
Squidward says: "Will you let go of that stupid pizza, already?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't, it's for the customer!"
Squidward says: "Who cares about the customer?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I do!"
Squidward says: "Well, I don't!"

Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "Let go of the pizza!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "What are we gonna do now!"
Squidward says: "There's no road here!"
SpongeBob says: "I think town's this way."
Squidward says: "Oh, don't tell me, Jethro."
Squidward says: "The pioneers?"
SpongeBob says: "That's right."
SpongeBob says: "Moss always points to civilization."
Squidward says: "That way?"
Squidward says: "That way there?"
Squidward says: "So, let me get this straight..."
Squidward says: "you think that we should go that way?"
SpongeBob says: "Yep."
Squidward says: "Well, then I'm going this way."
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Squid, wait!"
SpongeBob says: "I don't think..."
Squidward says: "Trust me, I know where I'm going."
Squidward says: "Sponge, we gotta eat something."
SpongeBob says: "I heard in times of hardship, the pioneers would eat coral."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe it was sand, no, no, mud."
Squidward says: "Give me the pizza!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait, I remember now."
SpongeBob says: "It was coral!"
Squidward says: "Give it to me!"
SpongeBob says: "No, we promised it's for the customer."
Squidward says: "You're right."
Squidward says: "It's for the customer."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
Squidward says: "Maybe we better check on it, make sure it's okay."
SpongeBob says: "Well?"
Squidward says: "Just a peek."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, it's fine."
Squidward says: "No, I think I saw something."
Squidward says: "Oh, no."
Squidward says: "I was wrong."
Squidward says: "It looks okay."
Squidward says: "Sure is a fine-looking pizza."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah..."
Squidward says: "What's that?"
Squidward says: "Is that the cheese?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah..."
Squidward says: "And the pepperoni?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah..."
Squidward says: "Oh, looks good, huh?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm not letting you eat the pizza!"
Squidward says: "Give me the pizza!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Squidward says: "Don't make me take it away from you, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Get away!"
Squidward says: "Get back here, SpongeBob, give me the pizza!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Squidward says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Squidward says: "I want that pizza and you're gonna hand it over one way or another!"
SpongeBob says: "Look, we're saved!"
Squidward says: "Sure, we're saved."
Squidward says: "Now give me some pizza!"
SpongeBob says: "No, really Squid, we're saved!"
SpongeBob says: "We're saved!"
SpongeBob says: "We're saved!"
Squidward says: "Will you cut that out?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved!"
SpongeBob says: "Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved!"
SpongeBob says: "Saved, we are saved!"
Squidward says: "That's just a stupid boulder!"
SpongeBob says: "It's not just a boulder."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left?"
Squidward says: "That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae!"
Squidward says: "And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive..."
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "rocks?"
Squidward says: "Hold on there, Jethro!"
Orange fish says: "Yeah?"
SpongeBob says: "Congratulations, sir."
SpongeBob says: "Your Krabby Patty pizza is here!"
Orange fish says: "Wow, thanks!"
Orange fish says: "I've been dying for one of these."
Orange fish says: "It..."
Orange fish says: "Where's my drink?"
SpongeBob says: "What drink?"
Orange fish says: "My drink?"
Orange fish says: "My diet Dr."
Orange fish says: "Kelp?"
Orange fish says: "Don't tell me you forgot my drink!"
SpongeBob says: "But, you didn't order any..."
Orange fish says: "How am I supposed to eat this pizza without my drink?!"
Orange fish says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "But..."
SpongeBob says: "but..."
Orange fish says: "Didn't you ever once think of the customer?!"
Orange fish says: "!"
Squidward says: "Sponge?"
Squidward says: "Sponge?"
Squidward says: "It's okay."
Squidward says: "Sponge?"
Orange fish says: "Another one?"
Orange fish says: "Look, I told your little friend I ain't paying for that!"
SpongeBob says: "Did he change his mind?"
Squidward says: "He sure did."
Squidward says: "Ate the whole thing in one bite."
SpongeBob says: "No drink?"
Squidward says: "Nah."
Squidward says: "Now take me home."
SpongeBob says: "Are you kidding?"
SpongeBob says: "We have just enough time to make it back to work."
Squidward says: "Work?"
Squidward says: "Oh, my aching tentacles!"
