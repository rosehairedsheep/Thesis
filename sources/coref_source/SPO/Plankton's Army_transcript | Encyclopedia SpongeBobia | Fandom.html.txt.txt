Mr. Krabs says: "All hands report immediately!"
SpongeBob says: "Fry cook SpongeBob reporting, sir!"
Squidward says: "What's all the yelling about?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Today is the 25th anniversary of the first time me arch-enemy Plankton ever tried to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula."
Plankton says: "Can I have the secret formula?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No."
Plankton says: "Okay."
Mr. Krabs says: "But he was persistent!"
Plankton says: "Pretty please?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh-uh."
Mr. Krabs says: "He used disguises!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And I always came out on top!"
Squidward says: "Fascinating."
Mr. Krabs says: "But thousands of failures have made him crafty, so keep your eyes open!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You'll never know what trick he'll use to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula."
Robot says: "What a quaint restaurant."
Robot says: "I think I will sample their wares."
SpongeBob says: "Ooh, how weird!"
SpongeBob says: "A machine made to look like a customer."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "Why don't you go hose out the men's room?"
SpongeBob says: "With pleasure, sir!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Welcome to the Krusty Krab, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "May I help you?"
Robot says: "Yes, please."
Robot says: "I'd like an order of chili coral bits."
Mr. Krabs says: "You sure you don't want a Krabby Patty?"
Robot says: "No, thank you."
Robot says: "Will this cover it?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, sure."
Mr. Krabs says: "Here you go."
Robot says: "Good day."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hm."
Mr. Krabs says: "I was sure it was one of Plankton's tricks."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, at least his money's good."
Plankton says: "AH-HAH!!!!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You knew I would never distrust a dollar!"
Plankton says: "That's right, Krabs."
Plankton says: "Now hand over the secret Krabby Patty formula!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Or what?"
Plankton says: "..."
Plankton says: "I don't know."
Plankton says: "I never thought I'd get this far."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, then, allow me to suggest your next move."
Plankton says: "You just wait, Krabs!"
Plankton says: "Next time I'll..."
Plankton says: "ah, who am I kidding?"
Plankton says: "At least I can go home to a wife who understands."
Karen says: "So?"
Karen says: "Tell me what happened."
Plankton says: "I don't want to talk about it."
Karen says: "Talking will make you feel better."
Plankton says: "Leave me alone."
Karen says: "That's your problem."
Karen says: "You never let anyone in."
Karen says: "Plankton the rock, Plankton the loner..."
Plankton says: "And she's off, ladies and gentlemen."
Karen says: "You have to do everything yourself..."
Karen says: "..."
Karen says: "and that's why everything you try ends up like this..."
Plankton says: "I'm a failure!"
Karen says: "It's not that bad!"
Karen says: "You just require a little help."
Karen says: "Maybe some henchmen..."
Plankton says: "Henchmen?"
Karen says: "Yes, what you need to do is surround yourself with muscular tough guys who will do whatever you say."
Plankton says: "I like the sound of that."
Plankton says: "I'll canvas all the seediest lowbrow dives in town to find my minions."
Plankton says: "And I know just how to speak their language!"
Plankton says: "Felicitations, malefactors!"
Plankton says: "I am endeavoring to misappropriate the formulary for the preparation of affordable comestibles!"
Plankton says: "Who will join me!"
Plankton says: "?"
Scene cuts to Plankton sitting in a wheelchair in the Chum Bucket with a cast and bandages.
Plankton says: "I don't get it."
Plankton says: "No matter what I do, I always end up being squashed by someone bigger than me."
Karen says: "Oh, come on."
Karen says: "I think you're overreacting."
Karen says: "Sorry."
Plankton says: "That's okay."
Plankton says: "I'm no different than the millions of other Plankton in the sea."
Clem says: "Hey, look, everybody!"
Clem says: "It's cousin Plankton!"
All says: "Yee-haw!"
Plankton says: "I've been away from home longer than I thought."

Karen says: "Sheldon?"
Plankton says: "Will you please-!"
Karen says: "Sorry!"
Plankton says: "All right, as I was saying..."
Plankton says: "Okay, we all know Sheldon's a funny name."
Karen says: "Okay, okay."
Karen says: "I'm done."
Karen says: "No more."
Plankton says: "Good."
Plankton says: "Ahem, to continue."
Plankton says: "Okay, that's enough!"
Karen says: "Sheldon!"
Karen says: "Ha Ha!"
Plankton says: "Bottom line: we invade the Krusty Krab so I can steal the secret formula."
Plankton says: "What do you think?"
Family Member 1 says: "But what's in it for us?"
Plankton says: "Well, what do you want?"
Family Member 2 says: "Gawrsh."
Family Member 2 says: "Can I get a new string for my banjo?"
Family Member 3 says: "And another boot to match this'n?"
Family Member 4 says: "And some more memory for my laptop!"
Clem says: "And what about root beer?"
All says: "Root beer?!"
All says: "!"
Plankton says: "Help me get the secret formula and you can have as much root beer as you can drink!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward, it's almost closing time, and we haven't seen eye or antennae of ol' Plankton for hours."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yes, sir, I think this time, he's finally given up for..."
Plankton says: "Attention, Krusty Krab management!"
Plankton says: "This is your better speaking."
Mr. Krabs says: "What?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ah, you and what army, bug?"
Plankton says: "What army?"
Plankton says: "What army?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Plankton says: "Look around you, Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You planted grass?"
Plankton says: "Grass?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh-oh."
Plankton says: "You're right."
Plankton says: "The pipes are much too narrow."
Plankton says: "Besides, what I really want is the Krabby Patty formula."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, you might as well forget it."
Mr. Krabs says: "The formula is locked away in me safe, and I'll never give ya the combination."
Plankton says: "Silence!"
Plankton says: "That's it, a little to the left..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Curse you, Plankton, and your ability to join together to form a working human ear!"
Plankton says: "Hot dog!"
Plankton says: "Let it be known that on this day, I, Sheldon J."
Plankton says: "Plankton, single-handedly overthrew the Krusty Krab!"
Family says: "Ahem."
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton, wait."
Mr. Krabs says: "You can't look at the formula."
Plankton says: "Begging won't help."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm telling you, you won't be able to handle the truth."
Mr. Krabs says: "There are some things in this world that weren't meant for mortal eyes."
Plankton says: "Eye."
Mr. Krabs says: "Eye."
Plankton says: "I don't care."
Plankton says: "Drum roll please!"
Plankton says: "The secret recipe for one Krabby Patty is..."
Plankton says: "a pinch of salt..."
Plankton says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait!"
Plankton says: "..."
Plankton says: "Three teaspoons of chopped onions..."
Plankton says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm warning ya..."
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Plankton says: "..."
Plankton says: "A cup of love..."
Plankton says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't do it!"
Plankton says: "..."
Plankton says: "mixed together with the most important ingredient of all..."
Plankton says: "four heaping pounds of freshly ground..."
Plankton says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I warned ya."
Back in the Krusty Krab, the book falls on the ground and the family reads the recipe and gasps; they all run screaming while Mr. Krabs laughs, except for Clem who just stands staring at the book.
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey."
Mr. Krabs says: "Why ain't you running?"
Clem says: "Well, I can't read."
Mr. Krabs says: "Get out of here!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, guys."
SpongeBob says: "Did I miss anything?"
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, is this really the secret ingredient for the Krabby Patty?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Of course not!"
Squidward says: "Let me guess."
Squidward says: "It's at home, under your mattress."
