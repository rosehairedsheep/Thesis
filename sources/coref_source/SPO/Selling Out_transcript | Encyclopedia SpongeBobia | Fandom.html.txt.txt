The episode starts inside the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is counting money at the register until he feels a rumble coming from outside.
Mr. Krabs says: "Here they come, lads!"
SpongeBob says: "Hooray!"
Squidward says: "Fantastic."
Mr. Krabs says: "Thank you very much, madam."
Squidward says: "Please don't do that again."
Howard says: "I think the stain glass barstool can go over here."
Howard says: "And the suede hand carved wooden sports flag display case can go over there."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ahoy there, matey."
Mr. Krabs says: "Can I help you gentlemen with something?"
Howard says: "I'd like to speak to the owner."
Mr. Krabs says: "Who wants to know?"

Mr. Krabs says: "Howard Blandy?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You mean the Howard Blandy?"
Mr. Krabs says: "The Howard Blandy that masterminded the ruthless takeover of every small family owned business in Bikini Bottom?"
Mr. Krabs says: "That Howard Blandy?"
Howard says: "Get it together, little man."
Mr. Krabs says: "Sorry, it's just you're rich."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "To what do I owe the honor of having you at the Krusty Krab, Howard?"
Howard says: "What would it take to buy the Krusty Krab from you?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Buy the Krusty Krab?"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's not for sale."
Mr. Krabs says: "You know, I may not make as much as your fancy-schmancy-migger restaurant chain, but it's the blood, sweat, and tears of a hard days work."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's not about the mon..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Holy sweet mother of pearl!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I like the way you think, Blandy."
Mr. Krabs says: "But it's gonna take a lot more than a suitcase of cash to buy the Krusty Krab from me."
Howard says: "Oh, there's a lot more than that."
Howard says: "The rest is over there."
Mr. Krabs says: "Jumpin' King Neptune!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Sold."
Mr. Krabs says: "Can I have my money?"
Howard says: "Just one thing."
Howard says: "If you can sign this contract."
Howard says: "It just states that you relinquish the Krusty Krab and all proprietary ownership thereof."
Howard says: "Along with its employees, merchandise, logos, and cash registers."
Mr. Krabs says: "Do I still get the money?"
Howard says: "Of course."
Mr. Krabs says: "That'll be fine then."

Mr. Krabs says: "I'm free to do whatever I want."

Carl says: "Uhh, Squidward, can I talk to you for a second?"
Carl says: "What's our motto here at Krabby O'Monday’s?"
Squidward says: "Sincere service with a smile?"
Carl says: "Well, yes, but with the Krabby O'Monday’s spirit."
Carl says: "Now, Squidward, you wouldn't want to have to talk to human resources..."
Carl says: "..."
Carl says: "would you?"
Carl says: "So, what's our motto again?"
Carl says: "Now you're gettin' it."
Mr. Krabs says: "Morning, SpongeBob."

Squidward says: "Would you mind clearing this table for me?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Sure, Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ya know, I've never seen you so happy."
Squidward says: "They're watching us."
Mr. Krabs says: "That guy's a real pain in the hindquarters, eh Squiddy?"
Squidward says: "Uhh, Eugene, I think you need to look at page 20 of our employee handbook again."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, I don't need Carl's silly rules."
Squidward says: "I really think you should look."
Mr. Krabs says: "What's this?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Help me?"
Carl says: "Hey fellas,  what's going on over here?"
Squidward says: "Oh, hey, Carl, uhh, I was just reminding Eugene of article 24 section 3 of our employee handbook."
Carl says: "Cut the chatter, and pick up a platter."
Mr. Krabs says: "What have you done to the real Squidward?"
Carl says: "The less you know, Eugene, the better."
Mr. Krabs says: "What's going on around here?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Where's SpongeBob?"

Mr. Krabs says: "Processed Krabby Patties?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Computerized registers?"
Carl says: "Look around you."
Carl says: "Our customers are quite content with the contrived and the mediocre."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's because they don't know what they're eating."
Mr. Krabs says: "Excuse me, ma'am, do you know what's in that Krabby Patty you're eating?"
Martha Smith says: "No."
Mr. Krabs says: "See that?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Without all your smoke & mirrors, no one would stomach this garbage."
Frank says: "What'd he say?"
Frank says: "Garbage?"
Carl says: "Eugene, you're in violation of your contract."
Mr. Krabs says: "Rules!"

Mr. Krabs says: "I'll show you automated!"

Carl says: "Blandy?"
Carl says: "Code red!"
Carl says: "Free thinker!"
Mr. Krabs shoves the cash register in the Krabby Patty making machine.
Howard says: "Mr."
Howard says: "Krabs, is there a problem here?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You better believe there's a problem!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I used to kiss the ground you walked on, Blandy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "But after seeing this, I wouldn't even spit in your direction!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Krabby Patties are supposed to be made by hand, one at a time!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Not on a conveyor belt!"
Carl says: "Oh, my."
Carl says: "Does this mean I won't get that raise, sir?"
Howard says: "It's ruined!"
Friend says: "We'll have to sell it."

Friend says: "Nice doing business with you."
Mr. Krabs says: "Pleasure's all mine."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now get out of me restaurant."
Mr. Krabs says: "The Krusty Krab is ours again."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ya know, in a fit of maniacal rage, I may have destroyed the restaurant, scared away all our customers, and forced us into bankruptcy because I returned nearly every penny I sold this stink heap for, but it was all worth it."
Mr. Krabs says: "And I got back the love of my dear friends."
Squidward says: "Really, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No, not really."
Mr. Krabs says: "Get back to work!"
