Squidward says: "Can I help you?"
Patrick says: "Yeah."
Patrick says: "Let's see here."
Patrick says: "I have a question about the Krabby Kiddy meal."
Patrick says: "Is it really, really, really cute?"
There is a pause.
Squidward says: "Adorable."
Patrick says: "Cuter than a regular Krabby Patty?"
Squidward says: "Yes."
SpongeBob appears through his window.
SpongeBob says: "Psssssst."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, get the Krabby Kiddy Meal."
SpongeBob says: "Look,  30% cuter."
SpongeBob says: "And it only costs one dollar more."
Patrick says: "Oh yah!"
Patrick says: "Yah!"
Patrick says: "Yah!"
Patrick says: "I want that!"
SpongeBob brings out Krabby Kiddy meal.
Squidward says: "That'll be $4."
Squidward says: "99."
Patrick gets out "money".
Patrick says: "Is this enough?"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry Patrick."
Patrick says: "Oh, crud!"
Patrick says: "That's everything I got!"
Patrick says: "."
SpongeBob says: "I have an idea."
SpongeBob says: "We can buy it together and share it."
Patrick says: "Share it?"
SpongeBob says: "Sure."
SpongeBob says: "You see, sharing is the most wonderful..."
Patrick says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Patrick takes SpongeBob's money and gives it to Squidward.
Patrick says: "I'm familiar with the concept of "sharing"."
Bubbles change the scene. Patrick is eating his Krabby Kiddy meal.
Patrick says: "Sharing is fun."
Patrick says: "Huh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh yeah."
Patrick shoves the Krabby Kiddy Patty through his teeth, making the sounds of electric saws cutting wood as he does so.
SpongeBob says: "Aren't you gonna save some of that for me?"
Patrick says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "Nothing."
Patrick says: "Hey!"
Patrick says: "Where's the toy?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, it doesn't come with a toy."
Patrick says: "What!"
Patrick says: "?"
Patrick says: "That's a rip off!"
Patrick says: "I want my money back!"
Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs taking a money bath.
Mr. Krabs says: "Money back?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's the problem here?"
Patrick says: "My Kiddy meal didn't come with a toy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hmm."
Mr. Krabs says: "And you'd like to upgrade to the toy package is that right?"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, the Krusty Krab doesn't have any toys."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, really?"
Mr. Krabs says: "this?"
The Krabby Patty now has eyes, legs, a mouth, and arms made from kitchen ingredients.
Patrick says: "Gasp!"
SpongeBob says: "Gasp!"
SpongeBob says: "An officially "licensed" Krusty Krab toy?"
SpongeBob says: "."
Zooms in on Krusty Krab toy, then on SpongeBob. Then SpongeBob touches the Krusty Krab toy with his nose and the screen turns black except for SpongeBob and the Krusty Krab toy.
SpongeBob says: "."
Mr. Krabs says: "Eww."
Mr. Krabs says: "Disgusting."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ahem."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yep it's pretty special all right."
Mr. Krabs says: "And it can be yours for only..."
SpongeBob takes out crumpled up money. Mr. Krabs's eyes are wide and zoom in on the money.
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, good looking."
SpongeBob gives Mr. Krabs's money and Mr. Krabs gives SpongeBob the toy. Mr. Krabs runs back to his office and hangs up a "Do Not Disturb" sign.
SpongeBob says: "I love you officially licensed Krabby Patty toy."
SpongeBob says: "Not too formal."
SpongeBob says: "I think I'll call you, oh, Patty Pal!"
SpongeBob dances with Patty Pal.
Patrick says: "Am I interrupting?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hi, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Have you met my new toy?"
Patrick says: "Don't you mean "our" new toy?"
SpongeBob says: "Our new toy?"
Patrick says: "It came from the meal that we're "sharing."
SpongeBob says: "Sharing?"
Patrick says: "Remember?"
Patrick says: "Remember those words, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "I didn't say that."
SpongeBob says: "But I guess we can share Patty Pal."
Patrick says: "I thought we were sharing it?"
SpongeBob says: "When's my turn?"
Patrick says: "Aren't you supposed to be working?"
SpongeBob says: "Of course."
Scene changes to nighttime where Mr. Krabs locks up the Krusty Krab and everyone walks home.
SpongeBob says: "Now is it my turn?"
Patrick says: "No."
Patrick and SpongeBob arrive at their houses.
SpongeBob says: "How about now?"
Patrick says: "Nah, maybe tomorrow."
Patrick says: "No touching!"
Patrick says: "See you tomorrow."
SpongeBob says: "Yes!"
SpongeBob says: "Today's my Patty Pal day!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, this is going to be fun!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Gary, of course, Patrick will give me my turn with the Patty Pal!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Gary, you can be a real negative nancy!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "I heard that!"
Patrick says: "Uh, I'm not home right now!"
Patrick says: "Please leave a message!"
Patrick says: "Beeeep!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, it's me!"
SpongeBob says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "It's my turn to play with the toy!"
Patrick says: "I can't go out!"
Patrick says: "I just washed my hair!"
SpongeBob says: "You don't have any h- come out Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "It's my turn!"
Patrick says: "Got any ID?"
Patrick takes it and looks at it.
Patrick says: "Looks fake to me, pal!"
Patrick says: "Bye-Bye now!"
Patrick says: "You sure?"
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Time to share!"
Patrick says: "Deceiver!"
Patrick says: "You didn't leave at all!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, and you were washing your hair?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "I was too, see?"
Patrick says: "Nice dismount!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm working out!"
Patrick says: "Well, gotta go!"
SpongeBob says: "Hold on, buster!"
SpongeBob says: "Hand over the toy!"
SpongeBob says: "It's my turn!"
Patrick says: "I can't!"
Patrick says: "Patty Pal and me have really bonded!"
SpongeBob says: "Gary was so right about you!"
SpongeBob says: "You're a non-sharer!"
Patrick says: "Gary said that?"
Patrick says: "You're off my friend list, Gary!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Hand it over, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "I get to play with the Patty Pal today!"
Patrick says: "You can't take it!"
Patrick says: "It's not fair!"
SpongeBob says: "How about I only take it for half a day?"
Patrick says: "Mm-mm!"
SpongeBob says: "How about we trade off every hour?"
Patrick says: "Mm-mm!"
SpongeBob says: "Every half hour?"
Patrick says: "Mm-mm!"
SpongeBob says: "Every fifteen minutes?"
Patrick says: "Mm-mm!"
SpongeBob says: "Five minutes?"
Patrick says: "Mm-mm!"
SpongeBob says: "One minute?"
Patrick says: "N-n-no!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, my final offer, we trade off every second!"
Patrick says: "One."
SpongeBob says: "One."
Patrick says: "One."
Then Patrick is running away from SpongeBob because Patrick won't share his toy.. SpongeBob gets angry with a train sound. Now they start chasing each other. They go into Squidward's house. Chasing starts again, they roll and the glass shatters.
Squidward says: "I hate them."
Now, they're heading to Sandy's treedome.
Sandy says: "Howdy, Patrick, SpongeBob."
Both says: "Hi, Sandy."
Sandy says: "What in tarnation's going on with you two?"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob won't let me play with my toy."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick won't share OUR toy."
Sandy says: "What you need is a mediator."
Sandy says: "Y'all best sit down and work this out."
Sandy says: "Now the main problem in an argument is a lack of communication."
Sandy says: "You can only resolve conflict when you understand each other."
Sandy says: "So I want each of you to state what is most important to the each of you right now."
They're both screeching their voices.
SpongeBob says: "Water?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
They crawl panting from the treedome and gasp seawater until they return to normal.
Patrick says: "Oh boy."
SpongeBob says: "That mediator lady made some good points."
Patrick says: "Most definitely."
SpongeBob says: "It takes understanding."
Patrick says: "Communication is key."
They both glance at the Patty Pal, then SpongeBob makes a dive for it. They roll away, fighting, onto a bus, then a subway train, then a taxi and finally into the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob says: "It's my turn!"
Patrick says: "No, it's mine!"
SpongeBob says: "Mine!"
Patrick says: "If I can't have it, no one can!"
Patrick eats Patty Pal.
SpongeBob says: "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Avast, there, laddies!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's all this ruckerus about now?"
SpongeBob says: "It's our Krabby Patty toy, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, and Patrick ate it, so that I couldn't play with it."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob won't let me play with it."
SpongeBob says: "Only because you hogged it all night."
Patrick says: "I did not!"
SpongeBob says: "Did too!"
Patrick says: "Nuh-uh!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, you toy eater!"
Patrick says: "Tattletale!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa there, now!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Settle down!"
Mr. Krabs says: "All this brawling is over a toy?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You two shouldn't let a little trinket get between youse."
Mr. Krabs says: "You should be ashamed of yourselves."
Mr. Krabs says: "If I gave each of ya another toy, would that make you happy?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes."
Patrick says: "Yes."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, you're in luck!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You two seem so thrilled with the toy."
Mr. Krabs says: "I had an entire case of 'em made."
Mr. Krabs says: "They've been selling my hotcakes."
Mr. Krabs says: "That'll be $13."
Mr. Krabs says: "50 each."
Patrick says: "This time, it's on me."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, that's my money."
Patrick says: "Have you learned nothing about sharing?"
