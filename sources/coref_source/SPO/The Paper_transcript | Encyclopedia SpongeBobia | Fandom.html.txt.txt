The episode opens with Squidward coming out of his house, setting up a lawn chair, and sitting in it.
Squidward says: "Ah, time to relax."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, wait!"
Squidward says: "Now what?"
SpongeBob says: "You dropped this little piece of paper."
Squidward says: "Yeah, so what?"
SpongeBob says: "I just figured you probably want it back."
Squidward says: "What's the big deal?"
Squidward says: "It's only garbage."
SpongeBob says: "Garbage?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "But, Squidward, in the right hands, this paper is a gold mine of entertainment."
SpongeBob says: "A spectacular afternoon of underwater fun."
SpongeBob says: "A treasure trove of..."
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "garbage!"
SpongeBob says: "So you don't want it?"
Squidward says: "Right."
SpongeBob says: "Does that mean I can have it?"
Squidward says: "Yes, by all means, take it!"
Squidward says: "Hello?"
SpongeBob says: "You sure?"
Squidward says: "Yes!"
Squidward says: "For the final time, I don't want that paper."
Squidward says: "It's yours forever and ever!"
SpongeBob says: "So are you definitely, positively sure?"
Squidward says: "Get out!"
SpongeBob says: "But are you..."
SpongeBob says: "Last chance to change your mind, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Take it, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Take it, please."
Squidward says: "And promise me, no matter how much I may beg, and plead, and cry, don't give that paper back to me..."
Squidward says: "ever!"
SpongeBob says: "So, I take that as a possible no?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Squidward, that's a promise I'll just have to keep."
SpongeBob says: "Ah, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Paper, I am so lucky to have a friend like Squidward."
Squidward says: "What in the world are you giggling about?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, Squidward, it's just..."
Squidward says: "How can anyone have fun with just a piece of paper?"
SpongeBob says: "La, la, la, la, la."
SpongeBob says: "Gary, watch this!"
SpongeBob says: "Guess what I am."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Well, yes, Gary, I am a sponge with paper stuck in his pants, but I'm also..."
Squidward says: "Super-moron's more like it."
SpongeBob says: "Now I'm..."
Squidward says: "Oh, boy."
SpongeBob swings on a vine and lands on his pineapple house.
SpongeBob says: "Ugh."
SpongeBob says: "SpongeBob JunglePants summon animal friends."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "You're right, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "I'm not a jungle boy."
SpongeBob says: "I'm a box of army supplies,  Arrgh, I am not a pirate."
Squidward says: "Do a big yellow idiot with a stupid piece of paper."
Squidward says: "How did he do that?"
SpongeBob says: "Look, Gary, oral-gami."
Kids says: "Bird!"
Kids says: "Yay!"
Kids says: "Paper dolls, yay!"
Squidward says: "Hey, that little paper does seem like fun."
Squidward says: "I'm having fun, la-la-la..."
SpongeBob says: "La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la..."
Squidward says: "Okay, SpongeBob, top this one."
Squidward says: "Hey, Lil' Squidward, what's gray and ugly and has six arms?"
Lil' Squidward says: "I don't know, but have you looked in the mirror lately?"
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "What did you..."
Squidward says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, that's a good one, Squidward, now let me try."
SpongeBob says: "Have you heard any good jokes, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Paper?"
Paper says: "What happened to the paper that fell in the ocean?"
SpongeBob says: "I don't know, what happened to the paper that fell in the ocean?"
Paper says: "It was all washed up!"
SpongeBob says: "La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la..."
Squidward says: "Haha, I'm having so much fun with my new shell-cart."
Squidward says: "Ah-haha."
Squidward says: "Hey, SpongeBob, can your stupid paper do this?"
SpongeBob says: "Nope."
Squidward says: "Well, you can't play music with a piece of paper!"
SpongeBob says: "Hooray!"
SpongeBob says: "Hooray!"
SpongeBob says: "That was great, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "All those wrong notes you played made it sound more original."
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "I didn't play any wrong notes."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, see, you're playing it like this..."
SpongeBob says: "Ah, nothing like a duet between buddies, eh, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "I can't!"
Squidward says: "What do you mean you can't?"
SpongeBob says: "I can't!"
SpongeBob says: "You made me promise no matter how much you begged, and pleaded, and cried not to give the paper back to you ever."
Squidward says: "I never said anything like that!"
SpongeBob says: "Sure you did, Squidward, look."
Squidward says: "Take it, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Take it, please."
Squidward says: "And promise me, no matter how much I may beg and plead and cry, don't give that paper back to me… ever!"
SpongeBob says: "Wanna see it again?"
Squidward says: "No, I don't wanna see it again!"
Squidward says: "Just give me that paper."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Squidward, I am sworn to a promise."
SpongeBob says: "Maybe I should get going."
Squidward says: "Wait, wait, maybe we can trade for something."
SpongeBob says: "Wow, pocket lint!"
SpongeBob says: "You drive a hard bargain, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Paper for lint, hmmm..."
Squidward says: "Not the lint, the rubber band!"
SpongeBob says: "The rubber band?"
SpongeBob says: "Do I dare?"
Squidward says: "Oh, dare, dare!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I get it."
SpongeBob says: "You're just testing me."
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Squidward, I won't let you down."
SpongeBob says: "A promise is a promise."
Squidward says: "Listen, you!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Trade..."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, listen..."
Squidward says: "Everything must go!"
Squidward says: "Well, that's the last of it."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Squidward, is this still part of the test?"
SpongeBob says: "Because it's..."
SpongeBob says: "it's really getting harder and harder to keep my promise."
Squidward says: "Take it!"
Squidward says: "Take my shirt!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward's shirt."
SpongeBob says: "I've always loved that shirt."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, okay, I'll trade!"
SpongeBob says: "I can break a promise for this."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, do you want your other stuff, ‘cause this is all I'll need?"
Squidward says: "You can have all that junk, 'cause now I've got this!"
Squidward says: "I've got the paper, and you've got my useless garbage."
Squidward says: "Tada!"
Children says: "Boo!"
Squidward says: "I'm a guy who traded everything he owns for a..."
Squidward says: "Does anybody have any sunscreen?"
