Inside his pineapple house, SpongeBob is laying in bed snoring. His foghorn alarm sounds and he wakes up immediately; then, he inhales deeply and sighs before opening his window curtains.
SpongeBob says: "Good morning, day!"
Radio DJ says: "And that was "Aja" by Eely Dan."
Radio DJ says: "Next up is Lionel Fishy with his hit, "Sad Song."
The sad song begins to play, and SpongeBob begins sobbing again.
SpongeBob says: "That's a sad song!"
SpongeBob says: "He was a good little Krabby Patty."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, will you stop crying?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "But the Krabby Patty fell on the floor and he—"
Squidward says: "Krabby Patty nothing!"
Squidward says: "What now?"
Squidward says: "All right, look."
Squidward says: "So far today, and it's not even 2:00 yet, you have cried 43 times."
SpongeBob says: "And you wrote that number on a chalkboard."
Squidward says: "Yes!"
SpongeBob says: "Why?"
Squidward says: "I have no idea."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Squidward, there's no way I cry that much."
SpongeBob says: "There's not that many tears in my brain."
Squidward says: "Au contraire."
SpongeBob says: "What's this?"
Squidward says: "It's a quick montage of flashbacks I've edited together that shows the hundreds of tears you have cried over the years."
SpongeBob says: "Boo!"
SpongeBob says: "Hoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Boohoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Sob."
SpongeBob says: "Whimper."
Frenchy says: "Thousands of tears later..."
SpongeBob continues to watch himself crying in the video.
SpongeBob says: "Wow, guess I do cry a lot."
SpongeBob says: "I promise I won't cry anymore."
Squidward says: "Oh, nonsense!"
Squidward says: "I bet you can't go the rest of the day without crying."
Patrick says: "Star..."
Patrick says: "residence."
Patrick says: "Patrick speaking."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Hey, buddy!"
Patrick says: "Is it 7:30 already?"
SpongeBob says: "No, I'm still at work."
Patrick says: "How can I help you?"
SpongeBob says: "Do you think that I could go the rest of the day without crying?"
Patrick says: "Well, of course you can."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, great, thanks, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Umm..."
Patrick says: "sure."
Patrick says: "And did you remember to put that package outside where I told you?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, but I left it in a different spot."
SpongeBob says: "Just ask Gary, he knows where it is."
Patrick says: "Oh, yeah."
Patrick says: "Hey, good one, buddy."
Patrick says: "You almost had me there."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
Patrick says: "Yeah, talk to you later."
SpongeBob says: "All right, see ya."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, it's a bet."
Squidward says: "Wash my bike, clean out my rain gutters, and do all my yard work for a year."
SpongeBob says: "Sounds fair to me."
SpongeBob says: "And if I make it to midnight without crying, you'll come to a slumber party at my place."
SpongeBob says: "Just you and me."
SpongeBob says: "Ooh, what's the matter?"
Squidward says: "Um, nothing, I just threw up a little in my mouth."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks again for walking home with me, Squidward."
Squidward says: "There's a first time for everything."
SpongeBob says: "I can do this!"
Squidward says: "Isn't that beautiful?"
SpongeBob says: "I've never seen such a beautiful underwater sunset."
Squidward says: "Really tugs the heartstrings, doesn't it?"
Squidward says: "Is that a tear I see?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, well, sunset's over."
SpongeBob says: "Nice of you to drop in, neighbor."
Squidward says: "Nice of you to have me, I-- Oh, look SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Gary's sleeping."
Gary appears on a stack of newspapers sleeping, snoring and meowing.
SpongeBob says: "Aww."
SpongeBob says: "He looks like an angel."
Squidward says: "That is just so adorable."
Squidward says: "Almost makes you want to cry."
Gary begins to drool in his sleep.
SpongeBob says: "Yeah..."
Squidward says: "Oh, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Yes?"
Squidward says: "Your mail's here."
Squidward says: "Ooh, oh look, it's a postcard from your dear mother and father so far away."
SpongeBob says: "Mother, father?"
Squidward says: ""Dear SpongeBob, we are having a wonderful time in the South Seas and we miss you very, very much."
SpongeBob says: "My subscription to Jellyfishing Monthly's expired."
SpongeBob says: "Remind me to renew that, will you, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "No problem."
Later on, SpongeBob and Squidward sit on the couch watching the news.
Anchor Fish says: "Welcome back to Bikini Bottom News."
Anchor Fish says: "Our top story tonight: a series of sad tales."
Squidward says: "Ooh, let's turn it up."
Anchor Fish says: "Tragedy in the park when a young snail caught in a tree almost didn't get down."
Petey says: "Meow."
SpongeBob gasps and gets ready to cry.
Anchor Fish says: "However, he did get down."
SpongeBob says: "Hooray!"
Anchor Fish says: "Coming up, an interview with a manatee who didn't get what he wanted for his birthday."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, no."
Anchor Fish says: "And finally, sad news for Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fans."
Squidward excitedly raises up the volume.
SpongeBob says: "What, what, what?"
Anchor Fish says: "They will only be showing The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Show seven times a day instead of eight—"
SpongeBob says: "Let's watch something else Squidward, okay?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Squidward says: "Fine!"
Kid Fish says: "Hey, Dad, how about a game of catch?"
Unnamed father says: "Sorry, son, I'm late for work."
Unnamed father says: "I guess I can stay for a few throws."
Kid Fish says: "I love you, Dad."
Unnamed father says: "I love you, son."
SpongeBob says: "You know what they say about that television."
SpongeBob says: "Rots the brain."
Squidward says: "It's getting late."
Squidward says: "I'd better bring out the big guns."
Squidward says: "Oh, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "What would you say to a little music?"
Squidward says: "Don't be long."
Squidward says: "My secret weapon is waiting."
SpongeBob says: "You said something, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Oh, I just said, "Relax and enjoy the song."
SpongeBob says: "That's a really sad song, Squidward."
Squidward says: "You're not gonna cry though, are you?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
Squidward says: "Uh, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "No-no-no-no, wait."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "How about a bedtime story?"
SpongeBob says: "Now you're talking!"
SpongeBob says: "Whatcha gonna read me, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Umm..."
Squidward says: "How 'bout The Little Angler Who Got Lost?"
SpongeBob says: "That sounds like a very sad story."
Squidward says: "Oh, very sad."
Squidward says: "Umm..."
SpongeBob says: "Walking..."
Squidward says: "But, he was sad, because..."
Squidward says: "because he was lost..."
Squidward says: "he was lost and very sad."
Squidward says: "And then, he..."
Squidward says: "he started to cry!"
Squidward says: "And he kept crying and crying and crying and crying and..."
Squidward says: "that's right."
Squidward says: "You can do it."
SpongeBob says: "I'm wondering if it might not be so healthy to hold in all my tears, Squidward."
Squidward says: "You're exactly right, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "Let it all out."
Squidward says: "Don't fight the feel..."
Squidward says: "Well, SpongeBob, it looks like you won the..."
SpongeBob's eyes burst with tears, shooting a flood towards Squidward and smacking him against the wall. The tears shoot out the windows, door crack, chimney, and other holes in his house. They spread to Patrick's house, causing an entire waterfall inside.
Patrick says: "Wow, what a great show."
The tears flood the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, at least we're still together, little ones."
The Bikini Bottom Choir drives through the flood holding the angelic note; at SpongeBob's house, the tears continue to spray into Squidward's face, then stop; the cuckoo scallop hits him on the head. Now, SpongeBob and Squidward sit in front of the TV.
SpongeBob says: "More popcorn, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "No, no."
Squidward says: "No, no."
Squidward says: "Please."
SpongeBob says: "That's all right, let it out."
SpongeBob says: "You can cry all you want."
SpongeBob says: "You're among friends here."
Squidward whimpers even harder then starts bawling hysterically.
