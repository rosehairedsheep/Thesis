Dead Eye Plankton says: "Sheriff!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "'Round these parts we call them coffin jockeys!"

Dead Eye Plankton says: "Where do you get these guys?"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "All right, kid."
Dead Eye Plankton says: "I'm going to make it simple for you."
Dead Eye Plankton says: "I'm a villain, got it?"

Dead Eye Plankton says: "Understand?"
SpongeBuck says: "Yep."

Pecos Patrick says: "Those guys are a barrel of laughs, huh?"
Pecos Patrick says: "But lazy!"
Pecos Patrick says: "Anyway, you've got to get back and save the town, sheriff!"
SpongeBuck says: "I ain't no sheriff."
SpongeBuck says: "Or fry cook or even coffin jockey, and I'm no match for Dead Eye Plankton!"
SpongeBuck says: "I'm nothing."
Pecos Patrick says: "Out west, a man gets right back up on his coffin and faces his problems with the help of his idiot sidekick friend!"
Pecos Patrick says: "That's me!"
Pecos Patrick says: "Duhhh..."
SpongeBuck says: "I don't know,  Ow!"
SpongeBuck says: "Okay, okay!"
SpongeBuck says: "I'll do it!"

Pecos Patrick says: "Hop on, buddy!"
SpongeBuck says: "Thanks, idiot friend!"
SpongeBuck says: "But I don't know how we'll ever get back to Dead Eye Gulch by high noon."
Pecos Patrick says: "Don't worry."
Pecos Patrick says: "I got a short-cut."
Pecos Patrick says: "He-ya!"
Polene Puff says: "Why are we going so fast?"
William Krabs says: "'Cause without a sheriff, Dead Eye won't stop until he has the clothes off our backs!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "personal possessions, clothes off your backs, that should about do it!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "Look, I'm just going to drop off all my new stuff at the bank."
Dead Eye Plankton says: "I'll be back at high noon to rub my victory in your face with a little dance."
Dead Eye Plankton says: "Uh huh, waa-waa!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "Uh huh, waa-waa!"
Hopalong says: "I gotta admit, he's got skills."
Dead Eye Plankton says: "That's right!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "And when I take the deed to your saloon, Krabs, I'll own every building in town!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "And you'll all have to work for me the rest of your miserable lives!"
William Krabs says: "So, that's it."
Polene Puff says: "We lost."
Hopalong says: "I don't know how it could get any worse."
SpongeBuck says: "Hi, guys!"
SpongeBuck says: "I'm back in the nick of time!"
Pecos Patrick says: "We're heroes!"
Hopalong says: "You're morons!"
Polene Puff says: "It's too late."
Polene Puff says: "Plankton's taken everything!"
SpongeBuck says: "But it's only 11:55."
SpongeBuck says: "The final showdown always takes place at high noon."
Polene Puff says: "Well, I guess the early bird gets the worm."
Hopalong says: "And all our stuff."
William Krabs says: "And me money!"
William Krabs says: "Me beautiful, beautiful money!"
SpongeBuck says: "You can't give up!"
SpongeBuck says: "Before I came here, I would've given up, too."
SpongeBuck says: "But in the short 20 minutes I've known you, I've come to love Dead Eye Gulch."
William Krabs says: "Could you get to the point?"
William Krabs says: "We're freezing!"
SpongeBuck says: "What I'm a saying is if we all team up together, we can stand up to Dead Eye Plankton, and run him right out of Dead Eye Gulch for good!"
SpongeBuck says: "So, what do you say?"
William Krabs says: "Well, I think we all know the answer."
All says: "Forget it, SpongeBuck!"
Pecos Patrick says: "Why are you all standing in your pajamas?"
Pecos Patrick says: "No, don't tell me."
Pecos Patrick says: "Oh, I know!"
Pecos Patrick says: "You're throwing a slumber party!"
Pecos Patrick says: "Pillow fight!"
SpongeBuck says: "That pillow sure packs a wallop!"
Pecos Patrick says: "It's made out of wood,  like all pillows in the old west."
Pecos Patrick says: "Round 2?"
SpongeBuck says: "I do believe I'd sit this one out."
Pecos Patrick says: "Looks like it's just you and me, kid."
SpongeBuck says: "Come on, guys!"
SpongeBuck says: "We can do this!"
SpongeBuck says: "If we work together!"
William Krabs says: "No offense, kid."
William Krabs says: "But your advice is as terrible as your chili."
SpongeBuck says: "I don't blame you for losing faith."
SpongeBuck says: "I lost faith too."
SpongeBuck says: "But then, I discovered the love of my new idiot friend."
SpongeBuck says: "And we've come far."
SpongeBuck says: "So I'm sure with all of us working together, in idiot friendship, we can beat Dead Eye and save the town!"
SpongeBuck says: "So let's huddle up and make a plan, together!"
Hopalong says: "Uh, SpongeBuck, why do you keep saying bzbzbzbzbzbzb?"
SpongeBuck says: "Umm..."
Hopalong says: "You don't have a plan, do you?"
SpongeBuck says: "No."
SpongeBuck says: "To be honest, I didn't think I'd get this far."
SpongeBuck says: "But I know we can beat him!"
SpongeBuck says: "If we just work together!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "Oh, I am terrified."
All says: "Dead Eye Plankton?!"
All says: "!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "So, fry cook, you're back!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "And all alone."
SpongeBuck says: "You wish, Dead Eye!"
SpongeBuck says: "We are united!"
SpongeBuck says: "Right-- Hey!"
William Krabs says: "We're right behind you, boy!"
William Krabs says: "WAY, WAY behind you!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "So, it's come to this."
Dead Eye Plankton says: "Mano y mano."
SpongeBuck says: "Well, you can hold the mano, because it's come down to you and me!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "Well, well, well, look at the time!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "High noon!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "I hate all of you!"
William Krabs says: "Can I try?"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "You can't do this!"
Pecos Patrick says: "Three yee-haws for SpongeBuck!"
Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch says: "Yee-Haw!"
Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch says: "Yee-Haw!"
Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch says: "Yee-Haw!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Step right up, folks!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Just a dollar to stomp on old Dead Eye Plankton!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "Ah!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "Ouch!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "Ooh!"
Polene Puff says: "Take that, you no-good little varmint!"
Dead Eye Plankton says: "I have a lot of money!"
Pecos Patrick says: "Well, sheriff, you beat Dead Eye Plankton and saved the town."
SpongeBuck says: "You forgot the most important part."
Pecos Patrick says: "What's that?"
SpongeBuck says: "I discovered the power of idiot friendship."
Pecos Patrick says: "Come with me, I want to show you something."
William Krabs says: "Thank you, sheriff SpongeBuck for saving our town."
William Krabs says: "And for stepping on that little varmint."
Dead Eye Plankton says: "History will vindicate me!"
William Krabs says: "We melted down Plankton's gold and made a statue in your honor."
Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch says: "Oooh!"
Hopalong says: "I liked my design better."
William Krabs says: "Sorry about the whole “tricking you into being sheriff” thing."
William Krabs says: "And to make it up to you, I've got a new badge for you."
William Krabs says: "If you'll take it."
SpongeBuck says: "Wow!"
SpongeBuck says: "Fry cook!"
SpongeBuck says: "Thank you, good people of Bikini Gulch!"
SpongeBuck says: "The statue is truly amazing!"
SpongeBuck says: "Maybe a little too heavy in the hindquarters, but still, if I ever have a Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandson, I'd want him to look at this and say 'Hey!"
SpongeBuck says: "I'm proud of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather!"
Citizens of Bikini Gulch says: "Aaw!"
Fish #8 says: "Say seaweed!"
SpongeBob says: "So my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa SpongeBuck saved the town of Bikini Gulch!"
SpongeBob says: "And everyone in it!"
SpongeBob says: "I wonder what happened to the statue of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa."
Sandy says: "Yeah, and it's covered in jellyfish poop."
Sandy says: "Gross!"
Sandy says: "Don't touch that, SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "Eeew!"
Sandy says: "What are you doing?!"
Sandy says: "!"
Sandy says: "That boy ain't hooked up right."
SpongeBob says: "Look, Sandy!"
Sandy says: "HUH?!"
Sandy says: "!"

Sandy says: "Keep dreaming, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "Keep dreaming."
