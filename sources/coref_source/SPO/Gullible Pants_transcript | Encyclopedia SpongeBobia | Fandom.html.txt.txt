Mr. Krabs is in his office counting his money.
Mr. Krabs says: "Four hundred and fifty-one, four hundred and fifty-two, four hundred and fifty-three, four hundred and fifty-four, four hundred and fifty-five, four hundred and fifty-si..."
SpongeBob says: "Ahoy, sir."
SpongeBob says: "Where are you going?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh."
Mr. Krabs says: "Heh heh."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's a..."
Mr. Krabs says: "it's a secret."
SpongeBob says: "You have a secret?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Everybody's got a secret, SpongeBob, and mine's gonna take 15 minutes."
SpongeBob says: "Aye-aye, sir."
SpongeBob says: "And who will be "in charge" while you're gone?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Eh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, okay, you're in charge."
SpongeBob says: "Whaaat?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You're in charge for the next 15 minutes."
SpongeBob says: "I'm..."
SpongeBob says: "in charge?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, sure, why not?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You okay, boy?"
SpongeBob says: "I won't let you down, sir."
Mr. Krabs says: "What a sheesh."
SpongeBob says: "Naptime's over, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Now what do you say we work real hard until Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs comes back?"
Squidward says: "Krabs is gone?"
SpongeBob says: "Yep."
SpongeBob says: "And I'm in charge for the next 15 minutes."
Squidward says: "Wow."
Squidward says: "Wake me up when I care."
SpongeBob says: "Do you care now?"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squid?"
SpongeBob says: "Squid?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Squid?"
SpongeBob says: "Squid?"
Squidward says: "What?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, it's just that I'm in charge and..."
Squidward says: "And you interrupted my regulary scheduled Krusty Krab nap?"
SpongeBob says: "Regulary scheduled nap?"
Squidward says: "This must be important."
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs has never interrupted one of these before."
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
Squidward says: "But being as you're the  man in charge, you must have your reasons."
SpongeBob says: "Well, I, um..."
Squidward says: "What is it?"
SpongeBob says: "Um.."
SpongeBob says: "Nothing."
SpongeBob says: "Carry on."
SpongeBob says: "Boy, there sure is a lot of procedural type stuff I don't know about the Krusty Krab."
SpongeBob says: "Order up, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "You know, I'll let you serve this one."
Squidward says: "My stories are on."
SpongeBob says: "Gosh, I'd love to, Squidward, but I've got to cook the patties."
Squidward says: "So do it when you're done."
SpongeBob says: "And unclog the sink."
Squidward says: "Hmm."
Squidward says: "Would you like to hear a secret?"
SpongeBob says: "What kind of secret?"
Squidward says: "See that guy over there?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes?"
Squidward says: "He wants to be a fry cook, and you're his hero!"
SpongeBob says: "Me?"
Squidward says: "Why don't you give him a couple of pointers?"
Squidward says: "Let him cook his own patty, and don't take "no" for an answer."
Squidward says: "He's shy."
Squidward says: "This'll be good."
SpongeBob walks up to Frank and nudges him.
SpongeBob says: "Hey, buddy."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, it's me, SpongeBob, fry cook extraordinaire."
Frank says: "Uhh..."
Frank says: "Hello."
SpongeBob says: "I know your secret."
Frank says: "What?"
Frank says: "Who told you?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, a little cashier told me!"
SpongeBob says: "Follow me!"
Frank says: "Yeah, whatever you say, man!"
Squidward says: "Moron."
SpongeBob says: "Betcha didn't think you'd be in here today, did ya?"
Frank says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "First off, this is my grill."
SpongeBob says: "This is where the magic happens!"
SpongeBob says: "And this is my actual spatula!"
SpongeBob says: "So start fryin' up some patties!"
SpongeBob says: "I'll check on you later, my little prodigy!"
Squidward says: "Ha-ha!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob will believe anything!"
SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen.
SpongeBob says: "Order number 12!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, what are you doing?"
SpongeBob says: "Taking out an order!"
Squidward says: "You're serving Krabby Patties with your hands?"
Squidward says: "Do you know how filthy your hands are?"
SpongeBob says: "They are?"
Squidward says: "But, your feet, however, are nice and clean."
Squidward says: "Think about it."
Squidward says: "They've been protected by your shoes and socks all day."
SpongeBob says: "Ohhh!"
SpongeBob says: "Enjoy."
Debbie says: "Hey, is my food here yet?"
Frankie Billy says: "Here."
Frankie Billy says: "You can have mine."
Delivery Man says: "Delivery!"
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "What?"
Delivery Man says: "Here's the supplies you ordered."
Delivery Man says: "Hey, my pen."
Squidward says: "Oh, sorry."
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here!"
SpongeBob says: "Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo it's here!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, what is all this junk?"
SpongeBob says: "Now that I'm in charge, I've decided to redecorate the Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm gonna make it all pretty!"
Squidward says: "Yeah, have fun with that."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I'm in charge,  so you'll be having all the fun."
Squidward says: "Doing what?"
SpongeBob says: "Painting the walls, buffing the tables, sewing pretty curtains, washing the windows, varnishing the stools, hanging the ferns, waxing the toilets."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, you lucky dog!"
Squidward says: "Hey, SpongeBob, do you wanna hear another Krusty Krab secret?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Another Krusty Krab secret?"
Squidward says: "Yep."
Squidward says: "Do you wanna know how Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs gets all these customers?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes..."
Squidward says: "No expectations."
SpongeBob says: "What's that?"
Squidward says: "He keeps the place a dump, so the food seems even better by comparison!"
Squidward says: "So if you want to impress Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, you make it more filthy!"
SpongeBob says: "More filthy?"
Squidward says: "Throw trash on the floors, break furniture and never clean anything."
SpongeBob says: "Sounds like the Chum Bucket."
Squidward says: "Ah, but you'll be doing it on purpose."
SpongeBob says: "Ohhh!"
SpongeBob says: "How's this, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Lookin' good!"
SpongeBob says: "You mean, "lookin' bad!"
SpongeBob says: "" Enjoy our fine d√©cor!"
Nat says: "Next time, I'm picking the restaurant."
SpongeBob mops the Krusty Krab with muck and grime, until it is totally covered in brown goop.
SpongeBob says: "One Krusty Krab, covered in mud and slime!"
Squidward says: "You missed a spot."
SpongeBob says: "Got it!"
SpongeBob says: "Gum under all tables!"
SpongeBob says: "How's that for low expectations?"
Squidward says: "Lower!"
SpongeBob says: "Initiating stage two: collateral damage!"
SpongeBob says: "How was that?"
Squidward says: "Perfect!"
SpongeBob says: "Ehh..."
Harold says: "This place is disgusting!"
Fred says: "Yeah, let's get outta here, just as soon as I finish this delicious Krabby Patty."
Fred eats a Krabby Patty while the customers leave in anger and disgust.
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, all the customers are leaving!"
Squidward says: "What did we talk about?"
SpongeBob says: "Don't touch the material?"
Squidward says: "If you want the customers to stay, you need to provide some entertainment!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, can do, Squidward, can do!"
Harold says: "Come on, let's go."
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "You don't want to miss..."
SpongeBob says: "this!"
Debbie says: "What's he doing?"
Harold says: "He's..."
Harold says: "dancing!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ah, there's nothing like polished pincers to make ya feel like a man!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What the?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob dancing like a goofball?"
SpongeBob says: "And a hey, and a ho, and a hey and a ho!"
SpongeBob says: "And a hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, ha, hey, hee, ho..."
Mr. Krabs says: "And customers cowering in fear?"
Evelyn says: "Help us..."
Mr. Krabs says: "The Krusty Krab a filthy mess?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Frank holds a tray of food with a Krusty Krab hat.
Frank says: "Order number 20 ready for pickup."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward sleeping on the job?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, that's actually normal."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What have ye done to me Krusty Krab?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I was just following Squidward's advice, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "He told me all your secrets!"
Mr. Krabs says: "All me secrets?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Ah, Gwenevere!"
