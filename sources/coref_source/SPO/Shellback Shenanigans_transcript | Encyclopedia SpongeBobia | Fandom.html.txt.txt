SpongeBob says: "Good night, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Closing time already?"
SpongeBob says: "I just served a Krabby Patty to the last customer."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, have a good night, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, is it okay if I buy a Krabby Patty to go for my pet snail Gary?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I thought those things ate mostly kibble."
SpongeBob says: "It's a special treat."
SpongeBob says: "Just to get him ready for tomorrow..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Right!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Okay, that makes- Wait, what's tomorrow?"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, did you forget?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Probably."
SpongeBob says: "Tomorrow is "Bring Your Pet To Work" day!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't need a special day for that."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward's here every day!"
Squidward says: "REAL NICE!"
SpongeBob says: "Umm..."
SpongeBob says: "can I buy that patty?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, sure."
SpongeBob says: "Alright!"
SpongeBob says: "Gary's gonna be so excited!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I almost forgot."
Mr. Krabs says: "The price is double for pets because they're so special."
SpongeBob says: "Good idea!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Whoa, what?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What, what?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "We're all out of Krabby Patties!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Did you check the freezer?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I checked the freezer, the spare freezer, the back-up freezer, the extra freezer, the rear freezer, the micro freezer, and the freezer under the stairs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What about the freezer in the attic?"
SpongeBob says: "We don't have an attic."
Mr. Krabs says: "No attic?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "You sold it, remember?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, yeah."
Plankton and Karen are spying on Krabs and SpongeBob from the Chum Bucket with a telescope.
Plankton says: "Now what are they saying, Karen?"
Plankton says: "Karen?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Karen says: "I have no idea."
Plankton says: "What?"
Plankton says: "I thought you said you could read lips!"
Karen says: "I can, but you took my telescope away!"
Plankton gives the telescope to Karen.
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, that settles it, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "We're just gonna have to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties."
SpongeBob says: "A fresh batch?"
Mr. Krabs says: "That's what I said."
Mr. Krabs says: "A fresh batch of Krabby Patties."
Plankton says: "Okay, now what's he saying?"
Karen says: "He said that they're going to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties."
Plankton says: "A fresh batch ofâ€”"
Plankton says: "ooh, this is good."
Plankton says: "This is really good!"
SpongeBob says: "When are we making this fresh batch of Krabby Patties, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
Plankton says: "Okay, what'd he just say?"
Karen says: "What?"
Plankton says: "I said, "What'd he just say?"
Karen says: "He said, "What?"
Plankton says: "I have no idea, that's why I'm asking you what he just said!"
Karen says: "I know that, and I'm saying he said, "What?"
Karen says: ""!"
Plankton says: "I know that!"
Plankton says: "Wait..."
Plankton says: "oh, he said, "What?"
Plankton says: ""."
Karen says: "Yes!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow, a whole new fresh batch of Krabby Patties!"
SpongeBob says: "Gary's gonna go crazy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You know, SpongeBob, heh, might not be such a good idea bringing a dirty snail into the kitchen."
Mr. Krabs says: "I think we might just want to reschedule "Bring Your Pet To Work" day."
SpongeBob says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I promise that Gary will be sparkly clean."
SpongeBob says: "I'll give him an extra long bath tonight!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, okay."
Mr. Krabs says: "Just make sure he's healthy and clean!"
Plankton says: "Healthy and Clean, Fresh Batch of Krabby Patties?"
Plankton says: "Ooh, I think I smell a plan!"
Bubbles change the scene showing SpongeBob's house.
SpongeBob says: "Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "I brought you a delicious treat!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "There you are, Gare-bear."
SpongeBob says: "I brought you some kelp fries."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Great, Gary, just great."
SpongeBob says: "Now you're gonna need an extra, extra, extra, extra long bath!"
SpongeBob says: "You're not gonna come down from there, are you?"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Ugh!"
SpongeBob says: "You win, we'll bathe you in the morning."
Plankton says: "Good morning, sir!"
Plankton says: "My name is Sheldon R."
Plankton says: "Shellcleaner, owner and operator of Super Shell Cleaner Vacations Unlimited."
Plankton says: "Can I ask you a question?"
Plankton says: "Are you tired of your dirty shell resulting in tireless hours of..."
SpongeBob says: "Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm going to start the bath!"
Plankton says: "Look, I'll just cut to the chase."
Plankton says: "Do you have a dirty shell and hate bath time?"
Gary says: "Meow."
Plankton says: "Of course you do!"
Plankton says: "That's why I must tell you about our limited time offer."
Plankton says: "For not 4, not 3, but 1 luxurious night here!"
Plankton says: "At Club Shell!"
Plankton says: "A perfect resort for snails."
Plankton says: "Don't try to pinch yourself, this could be..."
SpongeBob says: "Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "The bath is ready!"
Plankton says: "..."
Plankton says: "all yours!"
Plankton says: "Now I know what you're thinking, but I got you covered!"
Plankton says: "A temporary shell will be provided for you to wear while yours is being cleaned, and all of this is free of charge, of course."
SpongeBob says: "Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "Your bath is ready!"
Gary immediately puts on the shell and leaves.
Plankton says: "Have a pleasant stay!"
Plankton says: "Bon voyage!"
Plankton says: "If my reasoning is correct, as SpongeBob's pet, I'll get to witness Krabby Patties being made from scratch!"
Plankton says: "Then I can copy the formula and destroy Krabs once and for all!"
SpongeBob says: "First, I'm gonna start you off with a yummy smelling shower gel!"
Plankton says: "Wha..."
Plankton says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, smells nice, doesn't it?"
Plankton says: "Ugh..."
SpongeBob says: "Bet that feels good, huh?"
Plankton says: "Curses!"
Plankton says: "I mean..."
Plankton says: "meow?"
SpongeBob says: "Gary, are you sure you're feeling alright?"
Plankton says: "I've never felt better!"
Plankton says: "Uh, I mean..."
Plankton says: "meow!"
SpongeBob says: "Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "You're turning green!"
SpongeBob says: "And talking!"
Plankton says: "No, I'm not."
SpongeBob says: "We gotta get you to the pet hospital!"
Plankton says: "Pet hospital?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Plankton says: "But what about the fresh batch of Krabby Patties?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Plankton says: "I mean, meow!"
SpongeBob says: "You're right!"
SpongeBob says: "I'll call Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs and tell him I'm gonna be late."
SpongeBob says: "Gary, you're a lot more talkative when you're sick."
SpongeBob says: "Excuse me, nurse."
SpongeBob says: "My snail has been talking and turning green."
SpongeBob says: "Is he sick?"
Sadie takes a look at "Gary".
SpongeBob says: "Is that yes?"
SpongeBob says: "Or no?"
Sadie says: "I have never seen such a drastic case!"
Sadie says: "Rush this snail to the intensive care unit stat!"
Plankton says: "Intensive care unit?"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "These are professionals."
Bubbles change the scene and Plankton is sitting on a bed.
Plankton says: "Karen!"
Plankton says: "Oh, sorry."
Plankton says: "I thought you were someone else."
Jennifer-Millie says: "Sir, all the doctor is saying is that your snail is still in the intensive care unit, and we just need to run a couple more tests."
Purple Doctorfish says: "That's not what I'm saying at all."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Gary!"
Purple Doctorfish says: "Yes, I'll be honest with you, son, we've tried everything we can."
Purple Doctorfish says: "We just can't find out anything wrong with him."
Purple Doctorfish says: "I've never seen anything like it."
SpongeBob says: "Please try to save him, doctor!"
Cut to Plankton.
Plankton says: "No!"
Plankton says: "No more!"
Plankton says: "Please!"
Plankton says: "I-I-I-I..."
Sadie says: "Relax, Gary, the tests are over."
Sadie says: "I'm just here to give you a little pill."
Plankton says: "Whew!"
Plankton says: "That's a relief."
Sadie says: "That wasn't so bad, was it?"
Sadie says: "Uh, Mr."
Sadie says: "SquarePants?"
SpongeBob says: "Gary!"
Sadie says: "The doctor says there's nothing more we can do."
Sadie says: "It's best to take him home and let nature take its course."
SpongeBob says: "You're- you're saying that he's..."
SpongeBob says: "that he might..."
SpongeBob says: "oh."
Plankton says: "If I could just have a..."
Plankton says: "Krabby Patty before I go..."
SpongeBob says: "Sure thing, little buddy, sure."
SpongeBob says: "Y'know, it's..."
SpongeBob says: "it's really poignant."
Plankton says: "What is?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, now that you can talk, we're..."
SpongeBob says: "we're running out of time to say I love you!"
Plankton says: "Oh, boy..."
Bubbles change the scene to the bus Gary is on.
Tourist says: "So, once again, we'd like to thank you for choosing Club Shell, and we hope to see you again real soon."
SpongeBob says: "Just a little further, Gare-Bare."
Plankton says: "Yes!"
Gary pulls busline angrily and slithers over to the Krusty Krab.
Plankton says: "Yes, SpongeFool, come right back with your complete undoing and victory will be mine!"
Gary slithers to Plankton angrily and growls at him.
Plankton says: "Mommy?"
Plankton says: "Hey, wait!"
Gary beats Plankton up, while Mr. Krabs hears this, and he sees Plankton running out the door.
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton?"
Plankton says: "Good day, sir."
Plankton says: "I'm just here to sample some of your delicious Krabby fare."
Plankton says: "I'm going!"
Plankton says: "I'm going already!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow, Gary's doing a great job as bouncer, huh, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
SpongeBob says: "Really earning his pay."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, he takes after you, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Pay?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
