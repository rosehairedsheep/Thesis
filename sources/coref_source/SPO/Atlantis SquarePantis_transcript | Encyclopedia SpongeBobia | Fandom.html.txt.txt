LRH says: "Yes, of course."
Mr. Krabs says: "What a ripoff!"
Mr. Krabs says: "This street ain't gold!"
LRH says: "Oh, if it's gold you want, you'll find it in our vault."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm Eugene."
Mr. Krabs says: "I like money."
LRH says: "Yes, I can see that."
LRH says: "Pleasure to meet you."
LRH says: "Come, I'll give you the grand tour of our Atlantean fortress."
LRH says: "I'm so glad you're all here."
Plankton says: "They're gone."
Plankton says: "Now to get to those weapons..."
Plankton says: "Ow!"
LRH says: "For centuries, we Atlanteans spent, nay, wasted our talents and energy building the most sophisticated weaponry to defend ourselves from invaders."
LRH says: "But we abandoned the idea of warfare long ago and now all these weapons gather dust behind this locked door as an example of what must be done if one wishes to live in harmony with all creatures of this, or any, world."
Mr. Krabs says: "Eh, harmony shmarmony."
Mr. Krabs says: "When do we get to see the treasure?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
LRH says: "But of course, follow me."
Mr. Krabs says: "Comin' through, boys!"
Plankton says: "These Atlanteans leave a room full of the most advanced weaponry unguarded?"
Plankton says: "No wonder they got lost."
Patchy says: "Well, bad news, kids."
Patchy says: "Encino's still lost."
LRH says: "It is both an honor and a pleasure to welcome you to Atlantis."
LRH says: "We haven't had visitors in some time."
LRH says: "You see, being in a lost city has certain disadvantages which I digress."
LRH says: "Now if you follow me, I'll show you some of our grandest achievements..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You told me the streets were paved with gold."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now that street light better be a 600 karat diamond or else."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ah hold still, Squidward."
Squidward says: "You're standing on my neck!"
They trip and the light bulb smashes.
LRH says: "Are you all right?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, but I feel odd."
Mr. Krabs starts acting strange.
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs sniffs.
Mr. Krabs says: "I'd know that smell anywhere."
Mr. Krabs says: "Me pockets!"
Mr. Krabs says: "They be smelling loot!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
His pockets drag him into the hall of Treasure and start taking the treasure.
LRH says: "Those pockets of yours certainly have a nose for treasure."
Mr. Krabs says: "These are me houndstooth pants."
LRH says: "What you see here is a glimpse of ancient Atlantean history."
LRH says: "Long ago we abandoned our obsession with wealth to focus on the pursuit of knowledge."
LRH says: "So help yourselves to as much as you pockets can carry!"
Mr. Krabs says: "As much as me pockets can carry?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "♪Oh, if I'd only known when I woke up today, I'd have stopped at me tailors along the way, and had ten more pockets put on me pants, 'cause I think I hear a money avalanche!"
Fish says: "Clear!"
Mr. Krabs says: "♪I'm alright, sonny!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Industrial accidents can make quite a mess."
Mr. Krabs says: "Unless you fall into a money press."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, make me into money, Mr."
Mr. Krabs says: "wonderful machine, I always knew that me true color was green!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, ever since I was a little kid, I dreamed of such a place, yes I did!"
Mr. Krabs says: "With mountains of money, and rivers of cash."
Mr. Krabs says: "And a pool of coins to make a splash!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, I'll open up a Krusty Krab with patties made of money."
Mr. Krabs says: "They'd be delicious, and expensive, and taste like golden honey!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Money and gold and treasure untold!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And all of it for me!"
LRH says: "Mr."
LRH says: "Krabs, we're off to see the bubble, would you care to join us?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Are you kidding?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I've just got here!"
LRH says: "Very well then."
LRH says: "Off we go."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, when are we gonna see the bubble?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, shhh!"
LRH says: "Don't dally, lads."
LRH says: "You don't wanna be left behind do you?"
SpongeBob says: "No, sir."
Sandy says: "You know, LRH, I was born with a scientific curiosity and I was wonderin' if I could have a look at some of your scientific achievements?"
LRH says: "Of course, Miss Cheeks, here we are, the combination of all our technology."
LRH says: "I give you the Atlantean Hall of Science."
Opens a large door.
Sandy says: "Hoppin' acorns."
Sandy says: "Look at all this high tech gear!"
Sandy says: "What does this gizmo do?"
LRH says: "It's a biomass converting device."
LRH says: "It can take any household object--this comb, for example--and turn it into say, ice cream."
LRH says: "Would anyone like to try?"
Both says: "Oh me, me, me, me, meee, mee!"
LRH says: "Go ahead!"
Both says: "Yay!"
The boys eat the ice cream.
SpongeBob says: "Comb flavored."
Sandy says: "What else can it turn things into?"
LRH says: "Actually it can only turn things into ice cream."
LRH says: "We haven't worked out that bug yet but I can show you the most amazing/fantastic device created by Atlantean hands."
LRH says: "Behold, this grand machine allows the user to shrink down to nano-stature, enabling them to battle germs hand to hand."
Sandy says: "How's it work?"
LRH says: "Please have a seat and I'll show you."
LRH says: "Now..."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, cool."
SpongeBob disappears.
Patrick says: "Where'd SpongeBob go?"
LRH says: "Right now, his molecules are being broken down into data which is assembled in this computer and is stored on these tapes, then re-assembled on a much smaller scale..."
SpongeBob says: "Someone help me!"
LRH says: "And finally passes through this tube into this tank which contains every living element known to..."
LRH says: "Oh, dear heavens!"
LRH says: "It looks like our scientists were working on a very aggressive case of the sniffles!"
LRH says: "He could be in trouble."
Patrick says: "Don't worry, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "I'm coming to help you!"
Patrick disappears.
Squidward says: "Okay, I've seen enough."
Squidward says: "Let me out of this thing!"
Squidward sees a giant nose.
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, don't make any sudden movements!"
The nose sneezes germs and Squidward falls over, jumps quickly and runs.
Squidward says: "Help!"
SpongeBob and Patrick follow while they're being chased by germs, and Sandy enters the game.
All says: "Help, Sandy!"
Sandy says: "Sounds like them critters is in trouble!"
LRH says: "Well, shall we continue on with the rest of the tour?"
Sandy says: "Y'all head out without me."
Sandy goes back in the machine again.
LRH says: "Well then, good luck."
LRH says: "Have fun."
LRH says: "We'll see you at dinner."
LRH says: "Your friend Sandy certainly is an excitable one."
SpongeBob says: "Quite."
Squidward says: "Somehow I knew I'd get stuck with you yahoo's the longest."
The camera zooms in to the heater vent where Plankton is hiding, Plankton chuckles.
Plankton says: "♪Oh, what a beautiful sight!"
Plankton says: "Weapons as far as the eye can see."
Plankton says: "But which one will be right for me?"
Plankton says: "How do I pick?"
Plankton says: "Which one will do the trick?"
Plankton says: "Which is best to guarantee eternal rest?"
Plankton says: "So many weapons!"
Plankton says: "How do I choose?"
Plankton says: "Look at this one with a beautiful fuse!"
Plankton says: "And with this one I couldn't lose."
Plankton says: "That one will surely give them the blues..."
Plankton says: "And this one here matches my shoes!"
Squidward says: "This stuff is wonderful and all but when are we going to see some real Atlantean culture?"
LRH says: "Gentlemen?"
LRH says: "What is art?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, oh, I know, I know!"
Squidward shoves SpongeBob.
Squidward says: "I thought you'd never ask!"
Squidward says: "Art is the conscious arrangement of elements in a manner that affects a sense of beauty."
LRH says: "Not even close!"
LRH says: "Go ahead."
LRH says: "Dream a little."
SpongeBob touches the wall with the brush and the paint creates SpongeBob's house door.
SpongeBob says: "It looks like my front door!"
LRH says: "Behold!"
LRH says: "The Hall of Arts!"
He opens the door, they step in, and Squidward's mouth opens.
Squidward says: "Incredible!"
Squidward says: "This painting is so realistic!"
Squidward says: "It looks like you could step straight into it."
LRH says: "And you can!"
Throws Squidward into the painting.
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
Squidward says: "This place is amazing!"
Atlantean says: "Hey, can you not sing?"
Atlantean says: "I'm trying to model here."
Atlantean Painter says: "Now hold on Nando."
Atlantean Painter says: "Why don't you take five."
Atlantean Painter says: "I'm really diggin' this squid's form."
The other Atlantean sighs and walks away.
Squidward says: "Looks like I'll be here inspiring these Atlantean art makers with my beauty."
Squidward says: "You guys go on ahead!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
SpongeBob says: "Bye, Squidward!"
They leave and Squidward poses.
LRH says: "Now this section of town is known for its advances in the science of fondue cooking."
SpongeBob says: "Excuse me, sir, this tour has been great and all, but uh, can we see the bubble now?"
LRH says: "Do excuse me."
LRH says: "Most folks don't stay with the tour this long."
LRH says: "Of course you can."
LRH says: "First, remember this."
LRH says: "This bubble is over one million years old."
LRH says: "It was brought here when the first Atlanteans colonized this place."
LRH says: "Deftly hand carried over billions of light years from our home planet."
LRH says: "It is our people's most beloved and treasured ancient relic."
LRH says: "But most importantly remember to have fun!"
Points to where the bubble is, and they walk to the bubble.
SpongeBob says: "There it is Patrick!"
Both says: "The World's Oldest Living Bubble!"
They land on the safe keeping tube.
SpongeBob says: "Look at it, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "So ancient, so floaty."
SpongeBob says: "It is the most beautiful, wrinkled up, dusty old bubble I've ever seen!"
Patrick says: "Like a delicate air raisin!"
They slide off the glass.
LRH says: "Now if you'll excuse me, I have to make ready for tonight's dinner."
LRH says: "So I'm just going to leave you two friendly strangers alone with our most beloved ancient and fragile Atlantean relic."
LRH says: "Join us in the dining hall when you've had an eye-full!"
LRH leaves.
SpongeBob says: "Thank you, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Lord Royal Highness, sir."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Oh, golly!"
Patrick says: "Oh, I don't know how much longer I can hold this!"
They managed to get the glass back after a close call when the bubble land on the glass on SpongeBob's side and bounces off without any harm, they laugh in victory.
SpongeBob says: "Whoo, that was a close one buddy!"
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
Patrick says: "We almost popped the most prized possession of all Atlantis-eans!"
SpongeBob says: "Boy, that would have been out greatest blunder without a doubt!"
SpongeBob says: "But we should go before something bad does happen."
Patrick says: "Ooh!"
Patrick says: "Let's get a picture for our scrapbooks before we leave."
SpongeBob says: "Great idea, Patrick!"
Both says: "Cheese!"
Patrick's camera flashes, and the bubble pops.
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, did you hear something?"
Patrick says: "A sort of a popping sound?"
SpongeBob says: "Mmm-hmm."
They look at each other screaming and their skin peels off, and SpongeBob's eyes fall in his mouth. Scene cuts to the gang having dinner.
LRH says: "So sorry I'm late."
LRH says: "The tour ran a little long."
LRH says: "So, how are you all enjoying our beloved city?"
Squidward says: "I'm never leaving this place."
Squidward says: "I've learned more about painting in a few hours here than I did in four years of community college."
Shows LRH a painting.
LRH says: "Absolutely marvelous!"
LRH says: "And Eugene, I assume the hall of treasure was everything you hoped for?"
LRH says: "And Sandra, how did you find our laboratory?"
Sandy says: "They are just amazing!"
Sandy says: "I used your invention room to make this!"
LRH says: "Splendid."
LRH says: "What does it do?"
Sandy says: "I'll show you."
Sandy says: "Now I can eat underwater without removing my helmet!"
Sandy says: "This is just the beginning!"
Sandy says: "I should have a cure for the common cold up and running by tomorrow afternoon with your high-tech lab!"
SpongeBob and Patrick walks in feeling nervous.
LRH says: "SpongeBob, Patrick, tell me."
LRH says: "How did you enjoy our rarest and most prized possession?"
SpongeBob says: "We have to go back to Bikini Bottom now!"
All says: "Huh?"
LRH says: "Ahahaha!"
LRH says: "Come."
LRH says: "Enjoy the best Atlantean cuisine has to offer before you leave."
SpongeBob and Patrick shakes.
Squidward says: "What is wrong with you two morons?"
SpongeBob says: "We have to go home now!"
Squidward says: "Why would you want to leave a paradise like Atlantis?"
SpongeBob says: "Because, uh, Gary misses me?"
Scene cuts to SpongeBob's house where Gary is having a party with other snails.
Patrick says: "We destroyed your most prized possession!"
LRH says: "Ahahaha!"
LRH says: "If there's one thing we Atlanteans enjoy, it's a healthy dose of dark humor!"
SpongeBob says: "It's not a joke, we burst the bubble!"
Sandy and Squidward gasped.
LRH says: "Haha."
LRH says: "That's not the real bubble."
LRH says: "It's just a prop for the tourists."
LRH says: "This is the real deal."
Holds up the real bubble in a bottle.
Both says: "Ooh!"
Patrick takes a picture of the bubble and the bubble finally pops.
Sandy says: "Don't just stand there!"
Sandy says: "Move!"
She pushes the gang, the guards attack with a trident, pickaxe, and mace.
Mr. Krabs says: "Can't you go any faster Sandy?"
Sandy says: "Maybe, if y'all use your feet!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Never mind!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Just keep doing what you're doing!"
Sandy groans, the guards shoot clear balls at them, Sandy throws Patrick like a boomerang, Patrick hits the wall.
Sandy says: "Come on, Patrick!"
She grabs Patrick, the guards shoot and Sandy uses SpongeBob as a shield.
SpongeBob says: "That tickles!"
Sandy says: "Hang in there, little buddy!"
LRH says: "Don't let them get away!"
The guards follow the gang outside the building, but they all see Plankton's giant tank, Plankton aims at them while laughing diabolically. Patchy reappears.
Patchy says: "Shiver me timbers!"
Patchy says: "It's Potty!"
Patchy says: "I wonder what parrot tastes like..."
Patchy says: "Come back here!"
Patchy says: "Uh-oh."
Patchy says: "Here come the hallucinations."
SpongeBob says: "Don't lose hope."
SpongeBob says: "Everything will be all right when you get to Encino."
Patchy says: "But, Encino is gone."
SpongeBob says: "It's not gone, if you believe."
Patchy says: "Believe, believe."
Baby says: "Ohh!"
Baby says: "Ohh!"
Patchy says: "Here, you want some?"
Patchy says: "Go on."
Patchy says: "Take it."
Patchy says: "You know, I don't like the mayonnaise, you know."
Patchy says: "You know, when it gets above 130, 135, it gets kind of grody, you know."
Computer says: "Launch sequence deployed!"
Patrick says: "Plankton's wrath tastes like ice cream."
Both says: "Thanks, Plankton!"
Plankton says: "Ice cream?"
Plankton says: "It shoots ice cream?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Plankton says: "?"
Plankton says: "Yah!"
Plankton says: "Ouch!"
Plankton says: "Ow!"
LRH says: "Look!"
LRH says: "A talking speck!"
LRH says: "This talking speck will make a fantastic  Won't you little fella?"
LRH squeezes him.
LRH says: "Amazing!"
LRH says: "This is so much better than that dusty old bubble!"
Plankton is in the baby bottle cage.
Plankton says: "You haven't seen the last of me!"
Plankton says: "When I get out of here I'll hunt you all down like a pack of--  No flash photography!"
The gang is getting on the van.
LRH says: "So nice to meet you all."
LRH says: "I hope you have a safe journey back home."
LRH says: "And do come back any time."
SpongeBob says: "So long."
SpongeBob says: "And thanks for the tour."
Everyone is in, and LRH closes the door, he takes the amulet off the van and gives it to a guard.
LRH says: "Dispose of this quickly."
LRH says: "We can't survive anymore visitors like these."
Guard says: "Sir, yes, sir!"
He runs to the dumpster and throws the amulet in there, LRH waves goodbye as they go off.
LRH says: "I thought sponges were supposed to make life easier."
Scene cuts to the bus Everyone is feeling sad, except SpongeBob.
SpongeBob says: "♪Goodbye, Atlantis."
SpongeBob says: "But we really have to go."
SpongeBob says: "Back to a little town, that is the greatest place I know-oh-oh-oh-oh!"
SpongeBob says: "Back to Bikini Bottom!"
SpongeBob says: "I can hardly wait!"
Mr. Krabs says: "♪But what about the treasure?"
Mr. Krabs says: "It was really great!"
SpongeBob says: "♪I love Bikini Bottom!"
SpongeBob says: "It's where my Gary is!"
Sandy says: "♪But Atlantis had that science stuff at which I was a whiz!"
SpongeBob says: "♪Soon I'll see the Krusty Krab."
SpongeBob says: "Where I'm happily employed!"
Patrick says: "♪But Atlantis had the oldest bubble which I cruelly destroyed!"
SpongeBob says: "♪You can't beat Bikini Bottom!"
SpongeBob says: "No place is so nice!"
Squidward says: "♪But Atlantis was a fabulous, artistic paradise!"
SpongeBob says: "♪Sorry, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "But it's the end of our Atlantean vacation!"
Squidward says: "♪And back to my depressing life of quiet desperation."
SpongeBob says: "♪Goodbye, Atlantis."
SpongeBob says: "We're Bikini Bottom bound!"
Squidward says: "♪Please turn this bus around!"
SpongeBob says: "♪We had our fun!"
Patrick says: "♪We sure did!"
SpongeBob says: "♪But now we're done."

SpongeBob says: "We're Bikini Bottom bound."
SpongeBob says: "There's no place like home!"
Mr. Krabs says: "There's no place like Atlantis!"

Mr. Krabs says: "I don't wanna go back!"
SpongeBob says: "♪We're Bikini Bottom bound!"
