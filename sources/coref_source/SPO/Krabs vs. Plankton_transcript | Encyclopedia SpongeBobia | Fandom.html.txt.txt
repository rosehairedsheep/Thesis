Open on the Chum Bucket. A clam crows like a rooster. Cut to a close-up of Plankton's face. He has his eye closed, and then slowly opens it to show its veins.
Karen says: "Maybe today will be the day?"
Plankton says: "Thank you for your patronizing words, computer wife."
Karen says: "Do you even have a plan?"
Plankton says: "Plan, shman."
Plankton says: "I'm going to wing it."
Plankton says: "What's the worst thing that could happen?"
SpongeBob says: "Careful, Plankton, I just mopped there."
Charlie says: "There really should be a "Wet Floor" sign."
Nat Peterson says: "Yeah, if that were me who slipped, I'd sue old man Krabs for all he's got."
Plankton says: "Does that include the Krabby Patty formula?"
Charlie says: "Of course."
Plankton says: "Oh, the pain!"
Plankton says: "I can't feel my arms and legs!"
Plankton says: "I think they're broken."
Plankton says: "I'll have to sue for my pain and suffering."
Mr. Krabs says: "Sue?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Female Customer #1 says: "Oh, that looks bad."
Dennis says: "Uh-oh."

SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs enter the frame and look at each other. Transition to ambulance workers pushing Plankton on a gurney.
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hold up a second!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton, we don't need to drag this little incident into court, do we?"
Plankton says: "Well..."
Plankton says: "if you transfer the Krabby Patty formula to me, I'll forget your gross negligence."
Mr. Krabs says: "Scoundrel!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You'll have me formula when you pry it from me lifeless claws!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm in a blue ruin."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm doomed!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I will do whatever it takes to keep the Krusty Krab formula from getting into Plankton's evil hands."
Mr. Krabs says: "What I really need is a good lawyer."
Richard says: "Hello, did somebody say "lawyer"?"
Richard says: "Richard A."
Richard says: "Bottomfeeder, Attorney at Law."
Richard says: "I couldn't help but notice that despicable display."
Mr. Krabs says: "So, uhh, how much is this going to cost me?"
Richard says: "Actually, I won't charge you a dime unless we win."
Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into American dollar signs.
Richard says: "In fact, I think we should counter sue for everything Plankton owns."
Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into gold bars. The weight on them makes him fall over.
Richard says: "Does that happen a lot?"
SpongeBob says: "No, they're usually silver."
Scene transitions to SpongeBob strolling into Mr. Krabs' office, humming his own credits theme song.
SpongeBob says: "Um, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What is it, lad?"
SpongeBob says: "I thought you might want to hear my testimony for when you call me as a character witness."
SpongeBob says: "I've been rehearsing it."
Mr. Krabs says: "Actually, SpongeBob, we won't be needing any testimony from you."
Mr. Krabs says: "Why, you'll be more of a..."
Mr. Krabs says: "of a liability than an asset."
SpongeBob says: "But I..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ah, run along."
Mr. Krabs says: "Make things ship-shape for my victory celebration."

SpongeBob says: "Oh no!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs' lawyer!"
SpongeBob says: "Speak to me!"
Richard says: "Wracked..."
Richard says: "with pain..."
Richard says: "can't move."
SpongeBob says: "But what about Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs' case?"
Richard says: "Looks like you're going to have to handle this one, son."
SpongeBob says: "But, I'm a..."
SpongeBob says: "a liability."
Richard says: "Everything you need to win..."
SpongeBob says: "Really?"
SpongeBob says: "Everything?"
Richard says: "Uh huh."
Richard says: "Everything but a suit."
SpongeBob says: "A suit?"
SpongeBob says: "Wonder where I could get a suit."
Scene changes to the Bikini Bottom Court House. Plankton in a wheelchair enters the courtroom and precedes to Mr. Krabs.
Plankton says: "I'll give you one last chance."
Plankton says: "I'll drop the charges if you give me the formula."
Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No."
Mr. Krabs says: "I didn't lay a claw on him."
Plankton says: "Oww!"
Plankton says: "My other arm!"
Mr. Krabs says: "He's lying!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Bah!"
Judge's gavel knocks and the two proceed to their desk.
Tom says: "Court will come to order."
Tom says: "The Honorable Judge Stickleback presiding."
Stickleback says: "Mr."
Stickleback says: "Krabs, where is your attorney?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't know where he could be."
The courtroom door bursts open, with SpongeBob standing there in a gray suit, similar to the previous lawyer's.
SpongeBob says: "Here I am!"
Stickleback says: "Thank you for joining us, Mr..."
Stickleback says: "uhh..."
SpongeBob says: "SpongeBob LawyerPants, your honor."
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you doing here, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Your lawyer, umm, fell down on the job, but don't worry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I have everything under control."
SpongeBob says: "It's uhh, all in here."
Mr. Krabs says: "Really?"
SpongeBob says: "Yep, right in here."
Mr. Krabs says: "Is there a problem?"
SpongeBob says: "Umm..."
SpongeBob says: "your lawyer didn't give me the combination."
Lawyer says: "Is the plaintiff ready to proceed?"
Plankton says: "Yes, your honor."
Plankton says: "I'll try."
Plankton says: "I..."
Plankton says: "was a vibrant, carefree, happy-go-lucky, single cell."
SpongeBob tries to split the briefcase in half, but splits himself. Mr. Krabs leans over.
Mr. Krabs says: "Pull yourself together, boy."

Mr. Krabs says: "How's it coming, lad?"
SpongeBob says: "Don't worry, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I'm on the case."
Plankton says: "Upon entering said establishment, I found myself without any warning, slipping and finally falling onto a hard, unforgiving floor  covered with a viscous fluid."
SpongeBob puts a lamp shade on his head.
SpongeBob says: "Bombs away!"
Plankton says: "Ahem!"
Plankton says: "Are you quite finished?"
SpongeBob says: "Mm-hmm."
Plankton says: "Now where was I?"
Plankton says: "Oh yeah."
Plankton says: "But the worst part is..."
Plankton says: "my dreams of completing a marathon like I promised my old Grammy have been dashed."
Plankton says: "Suckers."
Stickleback says: "Does the defense..."
Stickleback says: "have an opening statement?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, your honor."
SpongeBob says: "Poor Gram-Gram!"
Plankton says: "Mr."
Plankton says: "Krabs, can you identify this item?"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's a "wet floor" sign."
Plankton says: "Do you own one?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uhh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "well..."
Mr. Krabs says: "umm..."
Mr. Krabs says: "No, I don't."
Mr. Krabs says: "No, no!"

SpongeBob says: "Yes, your honor."
SpongeBob says: "Defense calls Squidward to the stand."
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: ", uhh, Squidward, is it?"
SpongeBob says: "My client has been called cheap."
SpongeBob says: "Would you agree with that ludicrous statement?"
Squidward says: "Yes."
Mr. Krabs says: "What?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Allow me to rephrase the question."
SpongeBob says: "Can you tell the court of some instance of Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs' generosity in any way?"
Squidward says: "Nope."
Squidward says: "Can I go now?"
Squidward says: "One day off in three years and I have to spend it testifying?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Must..."
Mr. Krabs says: "open..."
Mr. Krabs says: "case."
SpongeBob says: "So it was you who made the floor slippery, wasn't it?"
SpongeBob says: "Answer the question!"
SpongeBob says: "Need I remind you that you, sir, are under oath?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm doomed."
Transition to SpongeBob still trying to open the briefcase.
Mr. Krabs says: "You may as well give up on that case, me boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "My goose is cooked."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's..."
SpongeBob says: "Defense calls Plankton to the stand."
SpongeBob says: "Why did you go into the Krusty Krab that day?"
Plankton says: "To, you know, say hello to my once good friend, Mr."
Plankton says: "Krabs."
Plankton says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "Are you sure it wasn't to make off with one of these?"
SpongeBob says: "Gotcha."
SpongeBob says: "Weren't you there to steal the formula of the most delicious, sweet smelling sandwich known to Bikini Bottom?"
SpongeBob says: "Krabby Patty..."
Plankton says: "Yippee!"
Plankton says: "Finally it's mine!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'll take that!"
Plankton says: "Huh?"
Plankton says: "No, no, no!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Once again, Plankton, the sweetest of life's joys has eluded your grasp."
Plankton says: "No, no, no, no!"
Stickleback says: "Has the jury reached a verdict?"
Tom says: "We have, your honor."
Tom says: "We find the defendant not guilty..."
Tom says: "but he is cheap."
Mr. Krabs says: "Thank you, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "I was foolish not to accept your help from the beginning."
SpongeBob says: "That's okay, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I made you a present."
Mr. Krabs says: "A present?"
Mr. Krabs says: "For me?"
SpongeBob says: "Close your eyes and hold out your hand."
SpongeBob says: "It's a "wet floor" sign."
SpongeBob says: "I made it myself."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, it'll do."
Mr. Krabs says: "After all, it's free!"
