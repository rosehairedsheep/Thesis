Harold says: "Thanks!"
Squidward says: "Barnaclehead."
Harold says: "Pardon me?"
Harold says: "Thanks!"
Squidward says: "Look at them eating that garbage."
Squidward says: "It's disgusting."
Squidward says: "They're sickening."
Squidward says: "I hate Krabby Patties."
SpongeBob says: "Good one, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Good what?"
SpongeBob says: "Like you don't know."
SpongeBob says: "That's hilarious!"
SpongeBob says: "Everyone loves Krabby Patties."
Squidward says: "Yeah, well, not me."
Squidward says: "Don't encourage them!"
Squidward says: "They'll never leave."
All says: "The only people who don't like a Krabby Patty, have never tasted one!"
Squidward says: "That's me."
Squidward says: "Never had one, never will."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Squidward says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "What?"
SpongeBob says: "What did you say?"
Squidward says: "I've never had a Krabby Patty and never will."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry..."
SpongeBob says: "I don't..."
Squidward says: "I've never had a Krabby Patty."
SpongeBob says: "Those words."
SpongeBob says: "Is it possible to use them in a sentence together like that?"
Squidward says: "I've never had a Krabby Patty!"
Squidward says: "I've never had a Krabby Patty!"
Squidward says: "I've never had a Krabby Patty!"
SpongeBob says: "No wonder you're always so miserable!"
SpongeBob says: "Here, try this."
SpongeBob says: "If you try it, you'll love it!"
Squidward says: "Try one of those radioactive sludge-balls you call food?"
Squidward says: "Next, I suppose you'll want me to go square-dancing with Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "Come on, you're gonna—"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Open up the tunnel, here comes the train."
SpongeBob says: "Choo-choo!"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "Quit it."
SpongeBob says: "Come on, open wide!"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, if I were trapped at the bottom of a well, for three years, with nothing to eat but that Krabby Patty, I'd eat my own legs first!"
SpongeBob says: "But it's good for you!"
Squidward says: "G—"
Squidward says: "good for you?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "That thing is a heart attack on a bun!"
SpongeBob says: "No, Squidward, I meant..."
SpongeBob says: "good for your soul."
Squidward says: "Oh, puh-lease!"
Squidward says: "I have no soul!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, just half."
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "A quarter?"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "One bite?"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Just smell it."
Squidward says: "If I didn't want it out there, what makes you think I'd find it more appealing in here?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Squidward."
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "One bite."
Squidward says: "No..."
SpongeBob says: "You won't be sorry."
SpongeBob says: "It's delicious..."
Squidward says: "Listen, SpongeBob, how long are you prepared to keep this up?"
Squidward says: "Ohh..."
Squidward says: "do I really?"
SpongeBob says: "Ahh..."
Squidward says: "Poorly prepared!"
Squidward says: "Vile!"
Squidward says: "Unappetizing!"
Squidward says: "Disgusting excuse for a sandwich, that has ever been my displeasure to have slither down my throat!"
SpongeBob says: "But—"
Squidward says: "Get it?"
SpongeBob says: "But, it doesn't make any sense."
SpongeBob says: "The Krabby Patty is an absolute good."
SpongeBob says: "Nobody is immune to its tasty charms."
Squidward says: "Nobody but me."
SpongeBob says: "Are you sure?"
Squidward says: "Does this look unsure to you?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
Squidward says: "Good!"
Squidward says: "Now go spread the word!"
Squidward says: "After that performance, he'd never let me live it down!"
Squidward says: "I gotta sneak one."
Squidward says: "Just one, then..."
Squidward says: "I'm off the stuff for good!"
SpongeBob says: "I didn't think it was possible, but, I guess some people just don't like Krabby Patties."
Squidward says: "Uhh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "I need a Triple Krabby Supreme on a kelp bun,  with—"
Squidward says: "with extra sea pickles and, and burn it to a crisp, okay?"
SpongeBob says: "Coming right up!"
Squidward says: "Don't go..."
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "And while I strongly disagree with your decision, I accept it."
SpongeBob says: "Triple Krabby Supreme!"
SpongeBob says: "Triple Krabby Supreme!"
SpongeBob says: "Did somebody order a Triple Krabby Supreme?"
SpongeBob says: "Huh, they must've left."
Squidward says: "Well, why don't you just, uh, leave it out here, in case they come back."
SpongeBob says: "Nope, a patty this special should be eaten fresh, and..."
SpongeBob says: "well..."
SpongeBob says: "I haven't had one of these babies in over twenty minutes, so..."
Squidward says: "What do I have to do?"
Squidward says: "Eat one out of the garbage?"
Frank says: "I wish I could eat this, but I'm so darn full."
Frank says: "Oh well."
Squidward says: "I had to say garbage..."
Squidward says: "but, okay!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh no, what's this doing here?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "This patty should be cremated!"
Squidward says: "Hmm, honey..."
Squidward says: "?"
Squidward says: "Holy shrimp!"
Squidward says: "I don't know where to start."
Squidward says: "All that matters is that it's just you..."
Squidward says: "and me..."
Squidward says: "and nobody..."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "Is that you?"
SpongeBob says: "I always come to work at 3:00 AM."
SpongeBob says: "This is when I count the sesame seeds."
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing here?"
Squidward says: "Uhh, I forgot my..."
SpongeBob says: "And why is the patty vault open?"
Squidward says: "Oh, I thought that..."
SpongeBob says: "And why are you holding a patty behind your back?"
Squidward says: "I..."
Squidward says: "I..."
Squidward says: "I..."
Squidward says: "no, I didn't do..."
SpongeBob says: "And why are you acting so nervous?"
SpongeBob says: "And why are you sweating so much?"
SpongeBob says: "And why do you look so hungry?"
SpongeBob says: "And..."
Squidward says: "No, no, wait..."
Squidward says: "it's not what you think."
Squidward says: "Th-this is a big misunderstanding."
Squidward says: "You've got to believe me, I..."
Squidward says: "Listen, I am telling you..."
Squidward says: "You better listen to me, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "You like Krabby Patties, don't you, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "Yes!"
Squidward says: "Yes!"
Squidward says: "I admit it, SpongeBob!"
Squidward says: "I love Krabby Patties!"
SpongeBob says: "I knew it all along, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "No one can resist a Krabby Patty!"
Squidward says: "What's gonna happen?"
Squidward says: "Am I gonna blow up?"
SpongeBob says: "No, worse, it'll go right to your thighs..."
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "and then you'll blow up!"
Joe says: "Yeah, I remember my first Krabby Patty."
