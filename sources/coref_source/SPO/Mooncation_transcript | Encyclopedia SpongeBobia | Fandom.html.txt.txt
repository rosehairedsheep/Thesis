The both get dragged in by Sandy.
Sandy says: "Someone already made six copies."
SpongeBob raises his hand.
Sandy says: "Yes, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Who is this someone?"
SpongeBob says: "Do we know him?"
Sandy says: "By someone, I was implying me, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "Yes, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Can you not imply anymore?"
Patrick says: "It's confusing."
SpongeBob raises his hand again.
Sandy says: "This is where a little square pal of mine decided to pay me a visit."
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
Sandy says: "What do you think of my moon wagon?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry I activated it!"
SpongeBob says: "How was I to know it was hooked up to your doorbell?"
Sandy says: "Oh no, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "That's what you call a "coincidence."
Sandy says: "" I'm getting ready for my vacation!"
SpongeBob says: "Where are you going?"
Sandy says: "The moon!"
SpongeBob says: "You're going on a moon trip?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Sandy says: "Yep!"
Sandy says: "I'm all packed up and ready to go."
SpongeBob says: "I'll be right back!"
Sandy says: "..."
Sandy says: "load up the moon wagon?"
Bakerman says: "Number 12."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, I'm Number 12!"
Bakerman says: "What can I get for you today?"
SpongeBob says: "I need a bon voyage sheet cake."
SpongeBob says: "Could you put yummy words on it?"
SpongeBob says: "Hmmmmm, what would those yummy words be?"
SpongeBob says: "I got it!"
SpongeBob says: ""Have fun on the moon..."
SpongeBob says: ""."
SpongeBob says: "What rhymes with "moon"?"
SpongeBob says: "Tune?"
SpongeBob says: "Roon?"
SpongeBob says: "Noon?"
SpongeBob says: "Goon?"
Bakerman says: "How about “loon?"
SpongeBob says: "I got it!"
SpongeBob says: ""See you soon!"
SpongeBob says: "No, Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "You can't go without your sheet cake!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob?"
Sandy says: "What in cold chicken and pickles are you doing in my ship?"
Countdown says: "Launch commencing."
Sandy says: "Never mind."
Sandy says: "Can't stop the countdown now."
Sandy says: "Better strap yourself down."
Sandy says: "Looks like you're going on a mooncation!"
SpongeBob says: "I am?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Whoooooo!"
SpongeBob says: "Moon trip!"
SpongeBob says: "Moon trip!"
SpongeBob says: "Moon trip!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Sandy?"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy?"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy?"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy?"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Sandy..."
Sandy says: "Uh, I'm kinda busy here, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "Gotta recalculate to account for the extra weight."
Sandy says: "for the afterburners!"
Sandy says: "What were you saying, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I… brought you a “bon voyage” sheet cake."
Sandy says: "You can't bring regular food into space!"
SpongeBob says: "Wha, wha, wha, why not?"
Sandy says: "Because, as we leave Earth's gravity, everything becomes weightless, and any un-contained food will float off in all directions!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh."
SpongeBob says: "Is that a bad thing?"
Sandy says: "Only if it gets sucked into the reverse spatial linearity drive."
Sandy says: "Ah nuts!"
SpongeBob says: "Oops."
SpongeBob says: "Sorry, Sandy."
Sandy says: "Okay."
Sandy says: "I've got her up and running, again."
Sandy says: "Now, can you please sit with your hands folded for a while, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Roger that!"
SpongeBob says: "Folding hands."
SpongeBob says: "What do you think Sandy?"
Sandy says: "Just don't touch anything while we separate."
SpongeBob says: "Ok."
SpongeBob says: "What's moon crater boarding?"
Sandy says: "You ride these on that like this."
Sandy says: "Star gazer!"
Sandy says: "Yeehaw!"
Sandy says: "Nothing like extreme sports and zero gravity!"
Sandy says: "Alright your turn."
SpongeBob says: "Oh gee Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "I don't know."
SpongeBob says: "This looks kinda scary."
Sandy says: "Oh, come on SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "You got this!"
Sandy says: "It's a can of corn."
SpongeBob says: "I don't know what corn is, but I sure like cans."
SpongeBob says: "Alright, I'll give it a try."
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, this doesn't seem right."
Sandy says: "Uh oh!"
Sandy says: "Looks like SpongeBob's too light for lunar gravity."
Sandy says: "SpongeBob, grab a hold of this!"
Sandy says: "Wow, SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "What do you call that trick?"
Sandy says: "Interesting."
Sandy says: "Maybe you can teach me how to do a “Waaaaah!"
Patrick says: "Hey!"
Patrick says: "Who's Carol's real father?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "puncture into the side of the rocket."
Sandy says: "You did great, SpongeBob!"
Sandy says: "But, you should call your trick the "no-look, one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up, puncture the fuel tank on the rocket."
SpongeBob says: "Oops!"
Sandy says: "Come on, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "We gotta get while there's still enough fuel to make it home!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "I have to do something very important!"
SpongeBob says: "So, we are going to make it, aren’t we Sandy?"
Sandy says: "If the fuel holds out, there's no reason to panic."
Sandy says: "Without the engines, we've lost all control."
Sandy says: "We're coming in too steep!"
SpongeBob says: "Is that bad?"
Sandy says: "Only if you consider being consumed in a giant fireball “bad”."
SpongeBob says: "Well, in that case, I won’t… giant fireball?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, where are you going?"
Sandy says: "'m going to take this bull by the horns!"
SpongeBob says: "Are we gonna get consumed in a giant fireball?"
Sandy says: "Not if I can keep her nose up we aren't."
Sandy says: "Hang on!"
Sandy says: "It's gonna get bumpy when we hit the atmosphere."
Sandy says: "Yeehaw!"
SpongeBob says: "My goodness!"
Sandy says: "Yeehaw!"
Sandy says: "Yeehaw!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, oh my gosh!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, are you okay?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry I ruined your vacation."
Sandy says: "Ruined?"
Sandy says: "Oh heck no!"
Sandy says: "That was the most fun I've had in a toad's age!"
Sandy says: "Once I get my rocket fixed, you and me is heading to Mars."
Sandy says: "Now, let's go grab another one of them sheet cakes."
