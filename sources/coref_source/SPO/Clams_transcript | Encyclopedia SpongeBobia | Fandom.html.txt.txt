Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I can't believe me own crew would betray me like this."
Squidward says: "No."
Squidward says: "Uh-uh."
Squidward says: "No, we will not be swayed by tears anymore."
Mr. Krabs says: "I see."
Mr. Krabs says: "Then I guess I have no choice but to offer a reward."
Squidward says: "You're kidding?"
SpongeBob says: "Woo!"
SpongeBob says: "Is it another fishing trip?"
Mr. Krabs says: "No."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's this sandwich."

Squidward says: "Look again."
SpongeBob says: "You're right."
SpongeBob says: "How do we get outta here?"
Squidward says: "If we're real quiet, we can sneak over to the lifeboat."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
Mr. Krabs says: "live bait!"
Squidward says: "You're crazy!"
Squidward says: "If that clam didn't come before, what makes you think he'll come now?"
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, listen, I work with SpongeBob all day long, so I know what I'm talking about when I say..."
Squidward says: "Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, get us out of here!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Come on, fresh meat!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, poor Mr."
