The episode launches with SpongeBob reading at night in his pineapple home.
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, Squidward, have you seen SpongeBob?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Whoa."
Mr. Krabs says: "You don't look so good, laddie."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, it's nothing, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I just had a rough night."
SpongeBob says: "But it's nice and bright today!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Meandering mermaids!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's all this racket, boy?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get a hold of yourself, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "What is it now, boy?"
SpongeBob says: "Whenever I blink, I see nothing but the darkness!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Then don't blink."
SpongeBob says: "Great idea, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, it's working..."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, thats enough!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We've got fifty orders to fill!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now go in the cooler and get some fresh patties."
SpongeBob says: "You want me to go in there?"
SpongeBob says: "Save me, the darkness!"
Mr. Krabs pries him off and pulls him down.
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, look here."
Mr. Krabs says: "Your work is starting to affect me profits."
Mr. Krabs says: "You need to get some shut-eye."
Mr. Krabs says: "Why don't you get yourself a night light?"
SpongeBob says: "Night light?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It'll keep your room lit, so you won't be scared stiff!"
SpongeBob says: "Great idea, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "Excuse me!"
SpongeBob says: "Are these night lights guaranteed to keep the creepy creatures of the dark away?"
Gale says: "If I answer "Yes", will you leave the store sooner?"
SpongeBob says: "Now that I can see..."
SpongeBob says: "Now there's not one square inch of dark!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "What was that, Gary?"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "You're right, Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "I've got darkness inside of me!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob's having a party without me?"
SpongeBob says: "That was close, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "You're safe under these night lights."
SpongeBob says: "But you can't go out in the dark, buddy!"
SpongeBob says: "You don't know what kind of creepy critter could be lurking in those shadows!"
Patrick says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what are you doing!"
SpongeBob says: "?"
Patrick says: "Oh!"
Patrick says: "I had to move my rock out of the dark and into the light."
SpongeBob says: "You know what that means?"
SpongeBob says: "Your sleeping bag, sir."
Patrick says: "Thank you, my good man."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm so glad you made that gaping hole in the wall, letting in all t-t-t-t-t-t..."
Both says: "The dark!"
SpongeBob says: "The darkness, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I can feel it."
SpongeBob says: "Like it's creeping up on us..."
Squidward says: "What are you two whimpering about?"
Squidward says: "It's me, Squidward, you idiots!"
Patrick says: "Hi, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Listen, you guys."
Squidward says: "I don't care or want to know what you do in your spare time."
Squidward says: "But could you turn off all these lights?"
SpongeBob says: "But, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Oh, SpongeBob, there are no creepy creatures of the dark."
Squidward says: "It's all in your imagination."
Patrick says: "No, Squidward!"
Patrick says: "Don't go out in the dark!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what if Squidward's right?"
SpongeBob says: "What if all this is all in our imagination?"
Patrick says: "Well, in that case, we'll need even more lights!"
SpongeBob says: "You said it, Pat!"
Patrick says: "Quick, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "Turn it on!"
Fish #1 says: "The battery-operated spoon has saved me so much time."
Patrick says: "More lights, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "More lights!"
SpongeBob says: "Mermaid Man!"
SpongeBob says: "?"
Patrick says: "Barnacle Boy!"
SpongeBob says: "Aww..."
SpongeBob says: "Are you here to protect us from the darkness that surrounds us?"
Mermaid Man says: "We don't have time for your childish games!"
Mermaid Man says: "We're responding to the distress signal that you sent!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I'm sorry, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy."
SpongeBob says: "There appears to be a misunderstanding."
SpongeBob says: "You see, Patrick and I put up those lights to scare away the monsters in the dark!"
SpongeBob says: "We weren't trying to summon you."
Mermaid Man says: "Oh, fiddlesticks, SpongeBob."
Mermaid Man says: "Do you know how hard it is in our..."
Mermaid Man says: "advanced age..."
Mermaid Man says: "to move?"
Mermaid Man says: "Don't shine a giant light in the sky unless there's a real emergency."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, my!"
SpongeBob says: "Mermaid Man needs assistance!"
SpongeBob says: "There is no need to fear, AbsorboPants is here!"
The Moth says: "Savory light, come to me!"
SpongeBob says: "Say, let me help you!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, he's all taken care of."
Mermaid Man says: "Who?"
SpongeBob says: "The Moth, silly!"
SpongeBob says: "Your archenemy."
SpongeBob says: "You'll be happy to know he won't be going anywhere anytime soon!"
The Moth says: "See you in another 57 years!"
Mermaid Man says: "No!"
Barnacle Boy says: "I think it's time to go home."
Mermaid Man says: "Why are we here again?"
SpongeBob says: "Bye, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!"
Patrick says: "Bye, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!"
Mermaid Man says: "Who are those two hideous creatures of the dark?"
Barnacle Boy says: "I'll tell you about it in the morning."
Barnacle Boy says: "Now, drive!"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy zoom off in the Invisible Boat Mobile.
SpongeBob says: "We're all alone, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "No lights."
SpongeBob says: "No shelter."
SpongeBob and Patrick both begin sobbing. Then, it is dawn and we hear a rooster crow as the sun rises.
Patrick says: "Huh?"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob, there's a really big light!"
Patrick says: "I'll go get it, buddy!"
He runs up a beam of light to the sun.
SpongeBob says: "Pat!"
SpongeBob says: "Come ba..."
