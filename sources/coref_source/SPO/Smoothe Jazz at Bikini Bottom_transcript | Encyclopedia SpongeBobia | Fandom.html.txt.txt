Squidward says: "Can I give you a hand with that, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Sure."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Gee, looks like playing Kelpy G's music here in the restaurant has really energized him."
SpongeBob says: "Wow."
SpongeBob says: "Kelpy's music is really, um, unique."
Squidward says: "Kelpy's not for everyone."
D.J. says: "That was Kelpy G."
D.J. says: "Taking you on a trip that is out of this ocean."
D.J. says: "Hope you fellow Kelpheads got your tickets early 'cause his concert tonight at High Tide Stadium is, sorry, sold out."
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "Kelpy G is performing tonight, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "But tickets are…  sorry, sold out."
Squidward says: "Oh, how could this be?"
Squidward says: "Whatever shall I do?"
SpongeBob says: "You forgot to buy a ticket?"
Squidward says: "Oh no, I have a ticket."
Squidward says: "I just don't know what I'll do without you there."
Squidward says: "Oh wait, I just realized..."
Squidward says: "I'll be having the greatest time of my life!"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, may I at least gaze upon your ticket?"
Squidward says: "Oh yeah."
Squidward says: "I show you the ticket, and then through some manner of folly, you destroy it!"
SpongeBob says: "You're probably not gonna get that back before show time."
D.J. says: "This goes out to all those sad sacks without a ticket to tonight’s concert."
D.J. says: "We're giving away the last two tickets to one lucky caller."

SpongeBob says: "I am?"
D.J. says: "Not only have you won two front row seats, but you and a friend will go backstage to meet Kelpy G himself."
SpongeBob says: "Me and a friend."
SpongeBob says: "Hmm, I wonder who that will be."
SpongeBob says: "Can you believe it?"
