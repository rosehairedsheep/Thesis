Mr. Krabs says: "No."
Narrator says: "Good job, Mr."
Narrator says: "SquarePants."
Narrator says: "Now we go from behind the scenes to the front lines, where we'll examine the most important aspect of the industry, the customer."
Narrator says: "Or as we like to say, the "Krustomer"!"
Patrick says: "Who said that?"
Patrick says: "Are you a ghost?"
Narrator says: "Like precious, precious blood in an animal, the customer is what makes the Krusty Krab strong and alive."
Patrick says: "Squidward, your ceiling is talking to me!"
Squidward says: "Are you going to order something or just make friends with the paneling?"
Patrick says: "Uhh..."
Patrick says: "I'll have an uhh..."
Patrick says: "uhh..."
Patrick says: "uhh..."
Patrick says: "ah..."
Patrick says: "Huh?"
Patrick says: "What's that?"
Squidward says: "Patrick, go be stupid somewhere else."
Narrator says: "Ah-ah-ah, Squidward, remember what Mr."
Narrator says: "Krabs says."
Mr. Krabs says: "The money is always right!"
Patrick says: "The ceiling is right, Squidward."
Patrick says: "You're not a very good employee."
Squidward says: "Fine."
Squidward says: "May I please take your order?"
Patrick says: "I'll have uhh..."
Patrick says: "uhhhh..."
Narrator says: "We'll check up on these two later."
Narrator says: "It's Mr."
Narrator says: "Krabs business rival, Plankton!"
Plankton says: "Eat my microscopic dust, Krabs!"
Plankton says: "Your secret formula is finally mine!"
Narrator says: "He's stealing the formula!"
Narrator says: "What are you going to do, Mr."
Narrator says: "SquarePants?"
Plankton says: "You'll never catch me, Krabs!"
Plankton says: "Not after I switch into maximum overdrive!"
Narrator says: "And so, another emergency is avoided, thanks to Mr."
Narrator says: "SquarePants."
Narrator says: "Let's check in on Squidward again."
Narrator says: "Psst, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Huh?"
Narrator says: "Just remember POOP."
Squidward says: "Patrick, if I could make a suggestion."
Squidward says: "Why don't you just order a Krabby Patty?"
Patrick says: "Great idea, Squidward!"
Patrick says: "One Krabby Patty, please."
Narrator says: "Hang in there, Squidward, it's all part of the job."
