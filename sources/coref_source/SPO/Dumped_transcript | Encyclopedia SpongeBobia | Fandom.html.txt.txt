It's another great day in Bikini Bottom. Gary is out in a clearing and SpongeBob tiptoes over to a rock behind him giggling. He looks from behind it.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I've got ya now, Gary."
Gary says: "Meow?"
SpongeBob says: "Tag, you're it!"
Patrick says: "Hi SpongeBob, what are you doing?"
SpongeBob says: "Gary and I are playing tag."
SpongeBob says: "You wanna join us?"
Patrick says: "Oh boy, would I!"
Patrick says: "I'm it!"
Patrick says: "I'm it, I'm it, I'm it, I'm it!"
SpongeBob says: "That's just a snail's way of saying he likes you!"
SpongeBob says: "Well, I guess it's time for me and the Gare-Bear to get going."
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "Hey Patrick, have you seen Gary?"
SpongeBob says: "Come on Gary, we gotta let Patrick go to sleep."
Patrick says: "Well, I don't mind SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "In fact, why don't you let Gary stay over at my house tonight?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, that's a great idea!"
Patrick says: "A sleep-over!"
Patrick says: "Oh boy, oh boy!"
Patrick says: "This is gonna be great, Gary."
SpongeBob says: "Gee, this is great."
SpongeBob says: "My two best friends in the whole sea having a sleepover."
SpongeBob says: "OK, you two have a good time."
SpongeBob says: "I'll see you tomorrow."
SpongeBob says: "I'm awake!"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, guys, how was the sleepover?"
Patrick says: "Great, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "Watch this!"
Patrick says: "Wherever I go, Gary follows!"
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "Try and catch meeee!"
Patrick says: "Come on, Gary, let's play a different game."
SpongeBob says: "Who-ho-ho-ho!"
SpongeBob says: "Look out!"
Patrick says: "Hold it right there, DadMom AngryPants!"
SpongeBob says: "What's that supposed to mean?"
Patrick says: "I don't know, but I do know Gary knows who he wants to go with."
Patrick says: "Now, I suggest that you put him down and let him choose."
SpongeBob says: "Fine, but I would like to remind him who it was who fed him and housed him and sat on his bedside when he was sick and massaged his eyestalks when his eyes were sore!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Gary, go ahead, show him."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, Gary, come to me!"
SpongeBob says: "Come on, come on, Gary!"
SpongeBob says: "Come on, come here, Gary!"
Patrick says: "Well, well, well… I guess that answers that question."
Patrick says: "So long, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "Gary and me got stuff to do."
SpongeBob says: "You remind me of someone I once knew."
SpongeBob says: "A certain someone whose name will not be spoken in this household."
SpongeBob says: "Come on, let me show you around, Lary."
SpongeBob says: "And now, Lary, I present to you… dinner time!"
SpongeBob says: "Ta-da."
Patrick says: "Hi, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, hello, Patrick."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Hello, Gary."
Patrick says: "Would it be all right if me and Gary did some laundry around here?"
SpongeBob says: "Laundry?"
Patrick says: "And uh, SpongeBob, could we borrow some soap?"
SpongeBob says: "Soap?"
SpongeBob says: "But… we used to use soap."
SpongeBob says: "Gary…?"
Patrick says: "He only liked me for my shorts!"
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "He wanted the cookie in your pocket!"
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "G-G-Gary?"
Patrick says: "Gary?"
Patrick says: "I thought what we had was special..."
Patrick says: "!"
