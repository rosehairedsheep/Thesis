Plankton says: "What is going on here?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Karen says: "What's wrong now?"
Plankton says: "Same as always, look, empty again!"
Karen says: "So what are you gonna do about it?"
Plankton says: "I don't know anymore!"
Karen says: "Hey, hey, hey, why don't you just work on a new recipe?"
Plankton says: "What's the point?"
Plankton says: "I haven't had a customer in years!"
Nat says: "Hello!"
Plankton says: "Away with you!"
Plankton says: "Can't you see that I'm self-loathing here?"
Nat says: "Sorry, I just wanted a Chum Stick."
Plankton says: "What?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Nat says: "Yes, I'd like one of your Chum Sticks."
Plankton says: "You're kidding, right?"
Nat says: "No, I'm serious, I want a Chum Stick."
Plankton says: "Uh, okay if you insist."
Nat says: "Now this was so good, I'm going to have to come back tomorrow."
Nat says: "Here you go."
Nat says: "See you in the morning."
Plankton says: "Did you see that?"
Plankton says: "I didn't even have to threaten his life!"
Plankton says: "He loved it!"
Karen says: "How'd you pull that off?"
Plankton says: "Well it's simple, finally someone came in who has good taste."
Plankton says: "And he's coming back tomorrow!"
Plankton says: "Excuse me, Karen, but I've gotta whip up some more."
Plankton says: "I wait."
Plankton says: "I wait."
Plankton says: "I wait."
Plankton says: "I wait."
Narrator says: "8 hours later..."
Plankton says: "Huh?"
Plankton says: "Nat?"
Plankton says: "Hello?"
Plankton says: "Huh?"
Plankton says: "What?"
Plankton says: "Uh, it's closing time."
Plankton says: "I should have known it was too good to be true."
Nat says: "Hey!"
Plankton says: "Well, hello, Nat!"
Nat says: "I came back like I said yesterday."
Plankton says: "You certainly did, didn't you?"
Nat says: "I'd like another Chum Stick, please."
Plankton says: "Well, it's your lucky day, Nat."
Plankton says: "I happen to have a quite delectable one, right here."
Nat says: "Oh, boy!"
Plankton says: "Is it okay?"
Nat says: "Hey, how about I have another?"
Plankton says: "You betcha!"
Nat says: "Whoo, boy!"
Nat says: "I cannot believe how good these things are."
Plankton says: "Oh, well, you know."
Nat says: "All right, see you tomorrow."
Plankton says: "What?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Plankton says: "You're coming back again?"
Nat says: "Oh, you know it!"
Nat says: "And the day after that, and the next week after that!"
Nat says: "You've got a regular customer on your hands!"
Plankton says: "Oh, my, this is amazing!"
Plankton says: "At last, I've got my revenge!"
Mr. Krabs says: "â™ªRolling, rolling, rolling!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Money keeps on rolling along!"
Plankton says: "Don't bother."
Plankton says: "There's no need."
Mr. Krabs says: "What are you talking about?"
Plankton says: "I'm just saying I no longer need to copy you, Krabs."
Plankton says: "I've got my own winning recipe now."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're really funny, man!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You think you can compete with me?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Look, Plankton, look at all these loyal customers."
Mr. Krabs says: "Loyal to me, Plankton, not to you!"
Nat says: "Hey, Plankton, can I get another one of your delicious Chum Sticks?"
Plankton says: "But of course, loyal customer."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, no!"
Mr. Krabs says: "How can this be?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Boy, front and center!"
SpongeBob says: "Yes, sir!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton's trying to overthrow me business!"
Mr. Krabs says: "He's got a customer that actually likes his food!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You've gotta get that guy back on our side with a couple of Krabby Patties."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, you can count on me, sir."
SpongeBob says: "Why settle for Plankton's lumpy chum, when you can enjoy a steaming Krabby Patty for free?"
SpongeBob says: "Barnacles!"
SpongeBob says: "Oops."
SpongeBob says: "Oops."
SpongeBob says: "Oops."
SpongeBob says: "Oops."
SpongeBob says: "Oops."
SpongeBob says: "Oops."
SpongeBob says: "Come on, Nat."
SpongeBob says: "Just one accidental bite!"
SpongeBob says: "I see you're not hungry right now, but I'm telling you, that Krabby Patty is gonna make a great snack later."
Nat says: "Yeah, do me a favor."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, fishpaste!"
Plankton says: "Nat, back all ready?"
Plankton says: "That's the fifth time today."
Plankton says: "Not that I'm surprised."
Plankton says: "Karen, babe, fetch Nat another plate of that sweet chum."
Karen says: "Yes, Your Diminutiveness."
Plankton says: "Say, Nat, do you have any friends?"
Nat says: "Nope."
Plankton says: "Would you hurry up with that chum, Karen?!"
Plankton says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "There's your chum, bleep blap blop."
Nat says: "Hey, this doesn't look like chum."
Plankton says: "And that doesn't look like Karen!"
SpongeBob says: "Why, don't be ridiculous, my husband, bleep blap."
SpongeBob says: "Of course it's me."
Plankton says: "What have you done with Karen, you brute?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Nat says: "How many times do I have to tell you?"
SpongeBob says: "So you're saying that you love chum?"
SpongeBob says: "And all that you ever eat is chum?"
Nat says: "Yeah!"
Nat says: "Th-that's right!"
SpongeBob says: "Interesting."
Nat says: "A shortcut to the Chum Bucket?"
Nat says: "Hmm."
Nat says: "That must be for me."
SpongeBob says: "Welcome, valued customer!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Welcome, valued customer!"
Nat says: "This isn't the Chum Bucket."
Mr. Krabs says: "Why go to the Chum Bucket when the Krusty Krab has added tasty chum to our menu?"
Nat says: "That's okay, I only eat Chum Bucket brand chum."
Mr. Krabs says: "But we've developed a special recipe for the most discerning chum lovers."
Mr. Krabs says: "Besides, I locked all the exits until you give it a try."
Mr. Krabs says: "So what do you say?"
Mr. Krabs says: "You like it?"
Nat says: "It's..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah?"
Nat says: "It's..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, what do you think?"
Nat says: "It's the second foulest thing I've ever tasted!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What am I going to do?!"
Mr. Krabs says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I can't let Plankton have so much as one single customer!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I just can't afford it!"
SpongeBob says: "I guess you'll have to make Chum that's as good as Plankton's."
Mr. Krabs says: "But to do that, I need to know how Plankton makes his Chum."
Plankton says: "What do you think Krabs, baby?"
Plankton says: "This time I caught you trying to steal my secret formula!"
Plankton says: "Ironic, isn't it?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Unfortunately, I have no way of knowing."
Mr. Krabs says: "You see, crabs are not born with an innate inkling of irony."
Plankton says: "Ouch, double irony!"
SpongeBob says: "Triple irony, Plankton!"
SpongeBob says: "Though you nabbed Krabs trying to steal your formula, I'm still here to foil your evil plans!"
SpongeBob says: "So, it's like a dollop of irony on top of an ironic twist."
Plankton says: "Good thing I sprang for the dual spoon installation."
Karen says: "Call it a computer's intuition, but I sense your regular approaching, with an unusually large wad of cash."
Mr. Krabs says: "Look at all that loot!"
Plankton says: "That's right, Krabs!"
Plankton says: "And you're going to have to keep looking when my customer comes in and pays me for my chum!"
Mr. Krabs says: "D'oh, just put me out of me misery!"
Plankton says: "Back for more of my delicious chum, I see!"
Nat says: "Not this time."
Plankton says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
Nat says: "The deal's off, computer!"
Nat says: "I can't eat another bite of that slop, no matter how much you pay me!"
Plankton says: "Ha-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-huh?"
Nat says: "I have eaten ten of those things, and I've already had to go to the doctor..."
Nat says: "twice!"
Plankton says: "What's the deal, Karen?"
Karen says: "The deal was that I paid Nat to eat your chum, so you'd quit your constant complaining."
Plankton says: "All this time, I never had one regular customer?"
Karen says: "Duh."
Plankton says: "Should have known!"
Plankton says: "Why would anyone ever eat my slop?"
Karen says: "Uhh, there he goes again."
Karen says: "Cut it out, Plankton!"
Plankton says: "What?"
Plankton says: "It's just obvious that I'm a complete failure, and a waste of a lower life form!"
Plankton says: "Oh, woe is me!"
SpongeBob says: "Quickly, now is the time to beat a hasty retreat!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "And miss this?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I've never enjoyed meself more!"
Mr. Krabs says: "This irony's pretty good stuff!"
