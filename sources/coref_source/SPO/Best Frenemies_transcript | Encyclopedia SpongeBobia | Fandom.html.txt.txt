Plankton says: """ Pardon me, I've done nothing wrong."
Mr. Krabs says: "Then how do you explain this?"
Plankton says: "Holy Moley, how'd that happen?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't try that with me, Plankton."
Mr. Krabs says: "This new store is ruining me business."
Plankton says: "Really?"
Plankton says: "Wait a minute?!"
Plankton says: "!"

Plankton says: "Uncle!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Never mind that."
Mr. Krabs says: "What about SpongeBob?"

Mr. Krabs says: "Uh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "we've gone into business together."
Mr. Krabs says: "You see, SpongeBob, we were hired, uh..."

Plankton says: "Now we have to fix the roof."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's right."
Mr. Krabs says: "That's right."
Mr. Krabs says: "We have to fix the roof."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's, it's, it's leaking."
SpongeBob says: "Well, good luck with that."
SpongeBob says: "See ya."
Plankton says: "Keep her going, Krabs."
Plankton says: "At this rate, we'll have the Kelpshake's recipe faster than you can say..."
Speaker says: "You have three seconds until spontaneous combustion!"
Plankton says: "Let's beat it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "No kidding."
Plankton says: "Wait, you forgotten..."
Plankton says: "I'm throwing in the towel, Krabs!"
Plankton says: "All these convoluted plans are getting us nowhere."
Plankton says: "And to top it all off, I'm the only one that's taking the heat!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What's that suppose to mean?"
Plankton says: "I don't see you on the front lines."
Plankton says: "Sure, let me do all the work, while you just sit back like the fat gorilla you are!!"

Mr. Krabs says: "I don't know about this, Plankton."
Plankton says: "It's easy."
Plankton says: "Just smile and hand the cashier the money."
Cashier says: "Can I help you?"

Mr. Krabs says: "Hi there."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, could I get one KelpShake?"
Cashier says: "Sure, that'll be one dollar."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, okay."
Cashier says: "Sir, please let go of the bill."
Plankton says: "Release your grip, man."
Plankton says: "Do it!"
Cashier says: "Enjoy."
Mr. Krabs says: "Thanks."
Mr. Krabs says: "I can't believe we did it."
Plankton says: "Oh, believe it, Krabs."
Plankton says: "Now let's get to the lab and find out what this stuff is made of."
Plankton says: "What's the secret ingredient, Karen?"
Karen says: "Well, it appears that the main ingredient is, Kelp Juice."
Plankton says: "Just kelp juice?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Just kelp juice?"
Mr. Krabs says: "And to think this whole time I could've been selling these meself!"
Plankton says: "You?"
Plankton says: "What about me?"
Plankton says: "If anyone, I deserve to make a buck of selling this stuff."
Mr. Krabs says: "No way, pipsqueak."
Mr. Krabs says: "This gold mine is mine."
Plankton says: "Not if I can help it."
Plankton says: "Ow."
Karen says: "I wouldn't do that if I were you."
Karen says: "There's another ingredient."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, I paid good money for this thing."
Mr. Krabs says: "Of course I'm gonna drink it."
Mr. Krabs says: "What the..."
Mr. Krabs says: "?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I don't get what the big deal is."
Mr. Krabs says: "This tastes like a wet gym sock."
Plankton says: "Really?"

Plankton says: "Actually, there is a bit of a pungent aftertaste."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hmmm."
Mr. Krabs says: "This is amazing."
Plankton says: "Well, don't be selfish."
Plankton says: "Oh yeah."
Karen says: "Oh no."
Plankton says: "Krabs, we're all out of juice."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, we gotta get more."
Karen says: "You're making a big mistake."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ah, phooey."
Mr. Krabs says: "You don't know what you're talking about."
Mr. Krabs says: "KelpShake, KelpShake."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh how I love a KelpShake."
Plankton says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
Hazmat #1 says: "It'll take decades to clean this hazardous material up."
Hazmat #2 says: "I sure do feel sorry for whoever drank this."
Plankton says: "Look at us!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now what are we going to do?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, wait a minute!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hold it right there."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're not going anywhere..."
Mr. Krabs says: "without a ten second head start."
Plankton says: "It's good to be home."
Mr. Krabs says: "You said it."
Plankton says: "I love being hated."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, get back here you little booger!"
