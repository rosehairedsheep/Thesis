French Narrator says: "Ahh, another peaceful evening in Bikini Bottom."
French Narrator says: "Listen to the tropical tranquility."
French Narrator says: "Uh-oh."
The tunneling thing moves on to the rest of Bikini Bottom; a cop is writing a ticket for a car parked near a fire hydrant; the thing, still invisible, makes eating noises; we then see that the car has disappeared, so the cop picks up the fire hydrant, moves it to the adjacent car, and places the ticket on that car, whistling as he casually walks away; the thing moves on to SpongeBob's house; Gary wakes up, sees the thing, and meows in terror; SpongeBob is still fast asleep.
SpongeBob says: "I saw it!"
SpongeBob says: "It was big!"
SpongeBob says: "It was all wiggly!"
SpongeBob says: "And it ate everything!"
Patrick says: "That's horrible!"
SpongeBob says: "It was an Alaskan Bull Worm!"
Fred says: "He ate my wheelbarrow!"
Nancy Suzy Fish says: "He ate my children's homework!"
Unnamed Fish 3 says: "..."
Unnamed Fish 3 says: "Do I need to say it?"
Unnamed Fish 4 says: "How can we protect ourselves?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I've got it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Let's all buy a Krabby Patty!"
Nat Peterson says: "We should lock our doors!"
Mable says: "We should call my nephew!"
Knight Fish says: "We should dig a moat!"
Patrick says: "We should take Bikini Bottom, and push it somewhere else!"
Squidward says: "That idea may just be crazy enough..."
Squidward says: "To get us all killed!"
Patrick says: "What's wrong with my idea?"
Fred says: "Let's get someone to go after it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "There ain't no one fool enough to take on an Alaskan Bull Worm!"
Unnamed Sailor says: "You got a bathroom in this place?"
Mr. Krabs says: "In the back."
Mr. Krabs says: "Nooo!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You'll never get a cent out of me!"
Mr. Krabs says: "..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Sorry."
Sandy says: "Well, I don't know nothing about Alaska, but looky here."
SpongeBob says: "But, Sandy, you don't know!"
Sandy says: "Don't worry, SpongeBob."
Sandy says: "I won't be long."
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
Patrick says: "Push!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
Sandy says: "Hey, SpongeBob, you coming to watch?"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, don't go!"
Sandy says: "Why not?"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, I saw it!"
SpongeBob says: "It's big, scary, and pink!"
Sandy says: "So's Patrick's belly button, but I ain't afraid of that, neither."
SpongeBob says: "You'll get massacred!"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob, I'm from Texas."
Sandy says: "What you think is big and what I think is big are two totally different "big"s."
Sandy says: "Besides, he's got my tail."
Sandy says: "I can't take that sitting down."
SpongeBob says: "Okay, but what if the worm didn't take your tail?"
Sandy says: "If that worm ain't got my tail, who does?"
SpongeBob says: "Um, I do?"
Sandy says: "You do?"
Sandy says: "Where?"
SpongeBob says: "Um..."
SpongeBob says: "in my pocket."
Sandy says: "Well, why didn't you just say so?"
Sandy says: "Give it here!"
Sandy says: "Come on!"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob, that's a paper clip..."
Sandy says: "and a piece of string."
SpongeBob says: "No, it's not, this is your tail."
Sandy says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, yeah?"
SpongeBob says: "What if I said..."
SpongeBob says: "'blargen fedibble no-hip'?"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, this is your pappy speaking, and I forbid you to go after this worm!"
SpongeBob says: "Y'all come back here, young lady!"
Sandy says: "You ain't my pa!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, no!"
SpongeBob says: "I can't let you!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm not gonna let you get killed."
SpongeBob says: "If you find him, you'll get eaten for sure!"
Sandy says: "Ain't no way some dumb old sea worm's gonna make a meal of me."
Sandy says: "I'm too Texas tough!"
SpongeBob says: "No, not tough enough."
SpongeBob says: "Not tough enough!"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob, quit your worrying."
Sandy says: "I can take care of myself."
Sandy says: "After all, who's the strongest critter in Bikini Bottom?"
SpongeBob says: "You are."
Sandy says: "And who put the hi-yah, hi, ho, "K" in karate?"
SpongeBob says: "You did."
Sandy says: "And who saves your yellow backside from certain destruction on a regular basis?"
SpongeBob says: "You do."
Sandy says: "Right."
Sandy says: "And I can handle your little bull worm too, 'cause I am the best there is!"
Sandy says: "There ain't nothing too big or too ornery for me to catch."
SpongeBob says: "Okay."
Sandy says: "Say it."
SpongeBob says: "There isn't anything..."
Sandy says: "Ain't nothing!"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah but..."
Sandy says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "You see..."
Sandy says: "No!"
SpongeBob says: "I..."
Sandy says: "He's in that cave."
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, are you sure you..."
SpongeBob says: "?"
Sandy says: "Course I am!"
Sandy says: "I'm going in, and I ain't coming out 'til I got me a big heaping plate of worm stew."
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, that's not..."
SpongeBob says: "!"
Sandy says: "This shouldn't take long."
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, that's not..."
SpongeBob says: "!"
Sandy says: "Almost done!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy!"
Sandy says: "Yee-haw!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy..."
SpongeBob says: "?"
Sandy says: "Boy, howdy."
Sandy says: "This critter put up some sort of fight."
Sandy says: "But I'm from Texas, and as you can see, no worm is a match for me."
Sandy says: "I even found my tail!"
SpongeBob says: "That's not the worm."
Sandy says: "Pardon?"
SpongeBob says: "That's not the worm."
SpongeBob says: "That's his tongue."
SpongeBob says: "So what's the plan, Sandy?"
Sandy says: "Run faster!"
SpongeBob says: "I could've thought of that."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, wait a minute!"
SpongeBob says: "I was right, wasn't I?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Sandy says: "Later!"
SpongeBob says: "Ah, he is too big for you, isn't he?"
Sandy says: "Not now, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "I wanna hear you say it!"
Sandy says: "Can we talk about this another time?"
SpongeBob says: "Say it!"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "Say it, or I'll trip you!"
Sandy says: "No!"
Sandy says: "Get away!"
SpongeBob says: "Say it!"
Sandy says: "Not now!"
SpongeBob says: "Say it!"
Sandy says: "Okay!"
Sandy says: "You were right, and I was wrong."
Sandy says: "I was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!"
Sandy says: "Are you happy now?"
Unnamed Fish 3 says: "Not again!"
SpongeBob says: "Uh, Sandy?"
Sandy says: "Yeah?"
SpongeBob says: "What do we do now?"
Sandy says: "I've got it!"
Sandy says: "SpongeBob, you still got that paper clip and that string?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm way ahead of you, Sandy."
SpongeBob says: "Look, it's a necklace!"
SpongeBob says: "S for "SpongeBob" or S for "Sandy"!"
SpongeBob says: "That way they can identify our bodies!"
Sandy says: "No, silly!"
Sandy says: "How about S for "save our skins"?"
Sandy says: "We did it!"
SpongeBob says: "Yay!"
SpongeBob says: "He'll never get out of there!"
Sandy says: "We saved the town!"
SpongeBob says: "Yay!"
SpongeBob says: "Let's go tell everybody!"
Patrick says: "Push!"
Citizens says: "Hooray!"
Worm says: "Ouuuuuch..."
