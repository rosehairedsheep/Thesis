Mr. Krabs says: "Hey, I'm expecting a fifty cent rebate check."
Mr. Krabs says: "Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie."
Mailman says: "Sorry."
Mailman says: "No check."
Mailman says: "But I've got this."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, a correspondence in a bottle, eh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Grandpa Readbeard comin’ by to tonight night!"
SpongeBob says: "I didn't know your grandpa was a pirate, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Aye, I come from a whole family of pirates."
Mr. Krabs says: "Gramps used to say, "The Krabs Clan has been pirates for as long as we've had claws."
Mr. Krabs says: "" And he wanted me to be a pirate, too."
He flashes back to when he was a baby. His grandpa was babysitting him on his pirate ship.
Grandpa Redbeard says: "One day, you'll be a plunderin' pirate just like yer ol' granddad here."
Mr. Krabs says: "So I bought me a ship, hired a crew..."
Mr. Krabs says: ".."
Crew member says: "Aaarrrrr!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And for years, I drifted the high seas as a pirate."
Mr. Krabs says: "And booty did abound."
Mr. Krabs says: "I started to notice a recurring fee."
Mr. Krabs says: "I just wasn't turning enough profit."
Mr. Krabs says: "So I fired me crew and sold me ship."
Mr. Krabs says: "‘Twas also the last time I saw me granddad."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Aaarrr, if it ain't me pirate grandson."
Young Mr. Krabs says: "Well, actually, Grandpa,..."
Young Mr. Krabs says: "I just sold..."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Ya know how proud it makes me to see me only grandson continuin' in the family business."
Young Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah, uh, Grandpa..."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "And I'll be keepin' me eye on yer career to see how you progress."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Just remember, the only rule in the Pirate's Code of Honor is: Never tell a lie."
The flashback ends.
Mr. Krabs says: "For all he knows, the Krusty Krab is a pirate ship."
Mr. Krabs says: "If he were to find out the truth, it would break his salty, barnacle encrusted heart."
Mr. Krabs says: "Boo-hoo!"
SpongeBob says: "Why don't we just make the Krusty Krab look like a pirate ship."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hm."
Mr. Krabs says: "Not a bad idea, boy."
Mr. Krabs says: "But we're gonna need a first rate crew."
SpongeBob says: "We've got Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "And I could get Patrick to join up."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah."
An hour or two pass.
Mr. Krabs says: "All right, me hearties!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get this one thing clear."
Mr. Krabs says: "If Grandpa Redbeard is ever gonna believe I'm a pirate, ye landlubbers are gonna have to pass as a pirate crew."
Mr. Krabs says: "Which means, I want you to look like a pirate."
Mr. Krabs says: "I want you to talk like a pirate."
SpongeBob says: "Swarthy!"
SpongeBob says: "I mean..."
SpongeBob says: "shiver me timbers!"
Mr. Krabs says: "But most importantly, I want you to smell like a pirate."
Mr. Krabs says: "Very convincing, Patrick."
Mr. Krabs says: "And as me crew, you'll be makin' the Krusty Krab into an imitation pirate ship!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, let's get this restaurant ready to sail!"
A few minutes pass.
Mr. Krabs says: "Way to go, fellars."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Hee-ar!"
Mr. Krabs says: "He's comin'!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Har, har, har!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hide me, boy."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Eugene, me boy!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Aye, it's good to see you and yer ship after so many moons!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Just beginin' to think you was lyin' to yer old granddad!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, I..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Heh, heh."
Mr. Krabs says: "So, have ya met me hearties?"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Hm..."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "this might be a pirate crew."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "But more miserable jellyfishers than swarvy brine-skimmers."
SpongeBob says: "Um..."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Har, har, har!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "I'm just yankin' yer chain, boy!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "You look like a fine pirate crew."
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Now, let's see what this rusty old pelican can do!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Let's sail!"
SpongeBob says: "Aye, sir!"
Patrick says: "Aye, sir!"
Squidward says: "Aye, sir!"
SpongeBob says: "Ahoy, Captain!"
SpongeBob says: "We be catchin' a mighty gale from the northeast."
Mr. Krabs says: "Indeed, indeed."
Mr. Krabs says: "And just look at the treacherous surf in our path!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, that salty sea air be so thick, ya can almost taste it."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Aye."
Mr. Krabs says: "I better take the helm and guide us to safer waters."
Mr. Krabs says: "Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there, eh, Granddad?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I said, "Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "There it is!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That wind storm I mentioned earlier, it..."
Mr. Krabs says: "and, apparently me cabin is haunted as well."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "What's a hair net doin' on a pirate ship?"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Every pirate knows that the majority of his daily nutrition comes from whatever hair or skin flakes fall off the coke and into the stew."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "This hair net is deprivi' your crew of its essential nutrients."
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh, just a sec."
Kraken says: "Grrrrrr..."
Kraken says: "."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Aye, look at the size of that beast."
Mr. Krabs says: "Not to worry, Granddad."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Aha!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "That's the stuff!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Yaahh!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Uh..."
Mr. Krabs says: "good toss, eh, Granddad?"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Whah!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, nothing."
Mr. Krabs says: "Look!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Har, har, har, har!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "That's me boy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Clear!"
SpongeBob says: "Hooray!"
Patrick says: "Hooray!"
Patrick says: "Hooray!"
SpongeBob says: "Woo-hoo!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Sounds like we got a prize."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ready, Squidward?"
Squidward says: "You owe me big time, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Ar!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Take that, ya, ya scurvy dog!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Woo!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Check the size of this, Granddad."
Mr. Krabs says: "Check the..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Granddad?"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Ahoy!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Trouble aproachin' quick!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Approximately ten clips of the starboard bow!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Man your battle stations!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh no."
Mr. Krabs says: "If Granddad sees something, it must be the real deal."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "What have ya got, cotton in yer ears?!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Move!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What exactly are we dealin' with, Grandpa?"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Somethin' bigger than I've ever seen!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "A ravin' garganst comin' by with coarsmatic tangled locks!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, so depulsive."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Yeah."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "It must be destroyed!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Here, see for yourself."
Mr. Krabs says: "Go get it, Granddad."
Pearl says: "Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Wait a minute."

Pearl says: "Dad!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Now it's even more angry!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't worry!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I have it under control!"
Pearl says: "Daddy!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Pearl!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Could ya pipe down?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Your Great-Granddad Redbeard is in there!"
Pearl says: "What's with the lame outfit?"
Mr. Krabs says: "What?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, never mind that!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I bet you're wondering about that."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Ar, you're darn tootin' I am!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Do you mind?"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "What kinda ship are you runnin' here?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Just a second."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Arrrrrrrrrrrr!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Arrrrrrrrrrrr!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, Granddad."
Mr. Krabs says: "There's a simple explanation."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "I've smelled sticky things, but nothin' smells stickier than a lie!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "The code that all pirates live by, you knows what it is, don't ya?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Of course I do, Granddad."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Well, then, say it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's, it's, it's a pirate never lies!"

Mr. Krabs says: "All a lie!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Krabby Patties: $2."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "00."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Krusty Combo: $3."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "99!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Coral Bits: $1."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "95?!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You see, Granddad?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm no pirate."
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm just a lowly restaurant owner!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I'm sorry I failed ye."
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Fail, me boy?!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Ha, ha, ha!"
Grandpa Redbeard says: "Why, I couldn't be more proud."
