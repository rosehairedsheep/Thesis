Plankton says: "Oh, Neptune!"
Plankton says: "Why, oh why?!"
Plankton says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Plankton?"
Plankton says: "No, please!"
Plankton says: "I told you I'd get the money!"
Plankton says: "Please, I-  Oh, it's you."
SpongeBob says: "Plankton, what's got you so upset?"
SpongeBob says: "I can hear you from three blocks away!"
Plankton says: "Oh, that."
Plankton says: "It's this doomsday device I invented."
Plankton says: "It just doesn't do what it's supposed to do!"
SpongeBob says: "Doomsday device?"
SpongeBob says: "What's it supposed to do?"
Plankton says: "Well, it's supposed to upset the Earth's axis."
Plankton says: "Causing a chain reaction with typhoons, earthquakes, etc."
SpongeBob says: "So, what does it do instead?"
Plankton says: "It just sparks and falls apart."
SpongeBob says: "Sparks and falls apart?"
Plankton says: "You don't believe me?"
SpongeBob says: "..."
SpongeBob says: "believe you."
Plankton says: "Oh, what's the use?!"
Plankton says: "!"
Plankton says: "Everyday the same old thing."
Plankton says: "Life is an endless succession of failures and disappointments."
SpongeBob says: "Well, look on the bright side, Plankton."
SpongeBob says: "If all your hopes and dreams finally came true, then you wouldn't have anything left to look forward to."
Plankton says: "Well, I didn't think I could feel any worse, but at least I know now that anything is possible."
SpongeBob says: "Plankton, wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
Plankton says: "I'm waiting!"
SpongeBob says: "Maybe what you need is to join a club or something."
SpongeBob says: "Meet new people."
SpongeBob says: "You know, make some friends."
Plankton says: "Hmmm."
Plankton says: "Yes."
Plankton says: "Yes."
Plankton says: "Are you suggesting I form an evil alliance?"
SpongeBob says: "Um, something like that."
Plankton says: "That is an excellent idea!"
Plankton says: "But where would someone like me find new friends?"
SpongeBob says: "Well, usually when I'm trying to find something, I just look it up in the phone book."
Plankton says: "Evil villain for hire."
Plankton says: "Call Man Ray."
Plankton says: "No job too diabolical."
SpongeBob says: "Man Ray?"
SpongeBob says: "But he's one of Bikini Bottom's most notorious super villains!"
SpongeBob says: "Arch nemesis of fame television super heroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy."
SpongeBob says: "Plankton, you were looking under Fiends not Friends."
Plankton says: "Oh, I know, SpongeBob."
Plankton says: "I know."
Plankton says: "Man Ray!"
Plankton says: "We meet at long last!"
Plankton says: "And who would have thought to find here you here, working a part-time job restocking vending machines?"
Plankton says: "That's very clever, Man Ray."
Plankton says: "Very clever."
Plankton says: "And now let us join in evil alliance!"
Man Ray says: "Have we met?"
Man Ray says: "Una!"
Man Ray says: "I'm listening."
Plankton says: "Then together we will steal the formula, crush Mr."
Plankton says: "Krabs and rule the world!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Plankton!"
Plankton says: "Oh, don't mind me, Krabs."
Plankton says: "I'm just taking a few measurements."
Plankton says: "I want to make sure there's enough room to install a hot tub when I assume ownership of this dump."
Plankton says: "But before you toss me out like yesterday's garbage, there's someone I'd like you to meet."
Plankton says: "Come on out, partner."
Mr. Krabs says: "Partner?"
Plankton says: "I want you to say hello to my new partner and your new overlord, Man Ray."
Man Ray says: "Hm, was it something I said?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Hang on to your hats and glasses!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Doom is upon us!"
Mr. Krabs says: "And it's dressed in a red leotard, ayy!"
SpongeBob says: "Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "You said to hold onto your glasses!"
SpongeBob says: "When all I could find were these extra large milkshake cups!"
SpongeBob says: "Do these count?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Never mind that now!"
Mr. Krabs says: "I want you to go up to the roof, and light the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Emergency Search Light."
SpongeBob says: "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Emergency Search Light?"
SpongeBob says: "What for?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Because!"
Mr. Krabs says: "We're having an emergency!"
SpongeBob says: "Aye aye, captain!"
Plankton says: "It looks like Krabs isn't as foolish as I thought."
Plankton says: "He's boarded-up the front entrance."
Plankton says: "I think you know what we need to do now."
Man Ray says: "Right, of course."
Mr. Krabs says: "You can relax now, Squidward."
Mr. Krabs says: "They're not getting in-  Never mind."
Worker #1 says: "Sorry, kid."
Worker #1 says: "This is a retirement community, not an insane asylum."
Mermaid Man says: "Huh?"
Mermaid Man says: "Do you hear that?"
Barnacle Boy says: "Probably just the old air conditioner acting up."
Plankton says: "Well, well, well, the Krusty Krab is finally ours!"
Plankton says: "Now we can take the secret formula and rule the world."
Plankton says: "Hand it over, Eugene."
Mr. Krabs says: "No way!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You'll never know the secret of making Krabby Patties!"
Man Ray says: "Wait a minute, I thought you said this was the secret formula for world domination."
Plankton says: "There's a direct correlation: Domination in the fast food marketplace leads to total world control."
Plankton says: "Maybe you need to taste a Krabby Patty, then you'll understand."
Plankton says: "You there!"
Plankton says: "Bring us a couple of Krabby Patties ASAP."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Huh?"
Squidward says: "I don't get paid enough for this."
Back at Shady Shoals, an old lady is walking through the front door. This gives SpongeBob an idea.
SpongeBob says: "Hmm."
SpongeBob says: "Good afternoon."
Worker #1 says: "Good afternoon, sir!"
As SpongeBob walks down the hall, he pops back to normal and starts running. He runs right past a "Lady's Choice" dance. He walks back to the door to check it out. He walks through the dance and sees Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy at the snack table.
SpongeBob says: "Mermaid Man!"
SpongeBob says: "Barnacle Boy!"
Elderly Lady #1 says: "May I have this dance?"
SpongeBob says: "Of course."
SpongeBob says: "I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to excuse myself."
SpongeBob says: "I-uh..."
Elderly Lady #2 says: "Hi, handsome."
Elderly Lady #2 says: "Do you wanna dance?"
SpongeBob says: "Certainly."
Elderly Lady #1 says: "Hands off, I saw him first!"
Elderly Lady #2 says: "That's what you think, sister."
Crowd says: "No, I saw him first!"
Crowd says: "Nuh uh!"
Crowd says: "He's mine!"
SpongeBob says: "Mermaid Man!"
SpongeBob says: "Barnacle Boy!"
Barnacle Boy says: "I never really liked these things, anyway."
SpongeBob says: "Ahhh!"
SpongeBob says: "Mermaid Man!"
Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab while the search light is still on.
Plankton says: "Ah, here we go!"
Squidward says: "Two Krabby Patties."
Squidward says: "Enjoy your meal."
Plankton says: "Oh, we will!"
Plankton says: "We'll enjoy it a lot, slave."
Plankton says: "Well!"
Plankton says: "Now that you've experienced a Krabby Patty firsthand, are you ready to assume control of the secret formula and take over the world?"
Man Ray says: "Hmm..."
Man Ray says: "it certainly was tasty, but I think I need to try another one before I know for sure."
Plankton says: "Hey!"
Plankton says: "That one was mine!"
Plankton says: "Well, are you satisfied?"
Plankton says: "Can we get on with our lives now?"
Man Ray says: "Hmm..."
Man Ray says: "satisfied..."
Man Ray says: "not quite!"
Man Ray says: "I think this will require another helping of "research"."
Man Ray says: "Hey, you there!"
Man Ray says: "Another platter of your finest Krabby Patties, please."
Back at Shady Shoals, SpongeBob is running around the halls.
SpongeBob says: "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!"
SpongeBob says: "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!"
Barnacle Boy says: "What the?"
Mermaid Man says: "Is nap time over already?"
SpongeBob says: "Come quick!"
SpongeBob says: "The Krusty Krab is in dire straits!"
SpongeBob says: "Plankton and Man Ray teamed up and blah blah blah blah blah blah!"
Mermaid Man says: "This must be one of the new guys."
Barnacle Boy says: "No kidding, we'd like to help out, but we can't just yet."
SpongeBob says: "What do you mean you can't?"
Barnacle Boy says: "We just woke up from our nap."
Mermaid Man says: "And after naptime is when they usually serve ice cream!"
Barnacle Boy says: "So in the meantime, uh, you're gonna have to be your own hero."
Mermaid Man says: "Unless you wanna wait for ice cream too?"
Back at the Krusty Krab, Squidward is making Krabby Patties. SpongeBob barges through the kitchen door, panting.
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, where have you been?"
Squidward says: "I've been covering for you on the grill for the past 3 hours!"
Squidward says: "My arm feels like it's gonna snap in half!"
Squidward says: "It's that guy in red."
Squidward says: "He's a really high maintenance customer."
Plankton says: "Can we please steal the secret formula now?"
Plankton says: "Pretty please, Man Ray?"
Man Ray says: "I must have more!"
SpongeBob says: "Thank you, sir!"
SpongeBob says: "Enjoy your meal."
Man Ray says: "At last!"
Plankton says: "Alright, fine!"
Plankton says: "I'll just steal the secret formula myself!"
Mermaid Man says: "Alright, Man Ray, lunch time's over!"
Man Ray says: "What?!"
Man Ray says: "!"
Man Ray says: "How did you two know I was here?"
Barnacle Boy says: "A little sponge told us."
Man Ray says: "This wasn't supposed to happen..."
Mr. Krabs says: "Here you go, Plankton."
Plankton says: "What's this?"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's the bill."
Mr. Krabs says: "For your partner."
