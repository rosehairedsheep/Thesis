A mail truck drives through the mountain range. Patchy the Pirate is driving the truck. He appears to be parodying S.D. Kluger from the song "Santa Claus is Comin' to Town.".
Patchy says: "Merry Christmas, kids!"
Patchy says: "I bet you're wondering why ol' Patchy has this mail truck."
Patchy says: "Well, this year, I wanted to be absolutely sure Santa got me letter."
Patchy says: "So I gave Mr."
Patchy says: "Mailman the day off."
He puts his pirate hat on the mailman tied up and gagged in the back of the truck, puts on his mailman hat and closes the door.
Potty says: "Do you even know how to get to the North Pole?"
Patchy says: "Oh, Potty, you silly parrot."
Patchy says: "Everyone knows that the directions to the North Pole are in the lyrics of the song "Jingle Bells."
Patchy says: "" ♪Dashing through the snow, in a..."
Patchy says: "Through the fields we go."
Patchy says: "Fa la la la la."
Patchy says: "♪ Okay."
Patchy says: "So we're looking for some fields here."
Potty says: "No, Patchy, the directions to the North Pole are in the song, "There Goes Santa Claus."
Potty says: "" ♪There goes Santa Claus."
Potty says: "There goes Santa Claus."
Potty says: "Left on Santa Claus Drive."
Potty says: "♪ Scurvy brain."
Patchy says: "Yeah, well, we ain't turnin' till we see some fields."
Potty says: "Look out!"
Potty says: "There's a fork in the road!"
Patchy says: "I don't see no fork."
The truck spins after the fork gets caught in the tire and they both scream.
Patchy says: "While we wait for the truck to stop spinning, let's see what SpongeBob is up to this Christmas."
The camera zooms in on Bikini Bottom and into SpongeBob's pineapple house. SpongeBob and Gary are sleeping. SpongeBob's alarm clock goes off and sleigh bells are heard instead of the foghorn noise. SpongeBob wakes up.
SpongeBob says: "♪Oh, it's drawing very near."
SpongeBob says: "My favorite time of the year."
SpongeBob says: "Eyes on me."
He walks over to Squidward's house where Squidward is putting up lights.
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "What are you doing today?"
Squidward says: "Stringing lights so Santa knows, in no uncertain terms..."
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "to go away!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay..."
SpongeBob says: "Ooh, what's that?"
Patrick says: "It's a trap!"
Patrick says: "A trap for Santa!"
SpongeBob says: "Ooh."
SpongeBob says: "Baited with Christmas treats?"
SpongeBob says: "♪Ohh..."
SpongeBob says: "Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me!"
SpongeBob says: "Fa la la la la la la la la lee!"
SpongeBob says: "And who is that I see?"
SpongeBob says: "Underneath her Christmas tree?"
Sandy says: "♪Oh, Christmas, oh, Christmas its sweet mystery."
Sandy says: "I'll mix a dash of Christmas cheer with a candy cane and deconstructed alchemy."
SpongeBob says: "Merry Christmas, Sandy!"
Sandy says: "Merry Christmas, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob skips to the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob says: "♪Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me."
SpongeBob says: "♪ Hi, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Are you ready for Christmas?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Why, Christmas is me favorite time of the year!"
Mr. Krabs says: "After all, 'tis the season of gettin'!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't you mean the season of giving?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Exactly!"
Mr. Krabs says: "The more you give, the more I get."
Plankton says: "♪Oh, Santa, Santa, Santa has his eye on me."
Plankton says: "He's seen everything I've done."
Plankton says: "Every plot, plan, and scheme."
Plankton says: "It's just a bit of fun."
Plankton says: "Santa has his eye on me."
Plankton says: "Every naughty deed is written in his scroll."
Plankton says: "So every Christmas morning, I get a stocking full of coal!"
Karen says: "Maybe you'd get a real present from Santa if you weren't the biggest jerk in Bikini Bottom."
Plankton says: "I'm way ahead of you, Karen!"
Plankton says: "Ha ha!"
Plankton says: "The Jerkmaker 9000 will make doling out tainted fruitcake a breeze!"
Plankton says: "Now, who's gonna be my first victim?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Plankton!"
SpongeBob says: "What've you got there?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey!"
SpongeBob says: "Is that a fruitcake dispenser?"
SpongeBob says: "You don't suppose I could have a piece, do ya?"
Plankton says: "Sure thing, fruitcake!"
Plankton says: "Here you go!"
Plankton says: "Hot from the oven and full in lovin'!"
SpongeBob says: "Ooh!"
SpongeBob says: "Ooh!"
SpongeBob says: "Hot!"
SpongeBob says: "Hot!"
SpongeBob says: "Hot!"
SpongeBob says: "Wow!"
SpongeBob says: "This is great!"
Plankton says: "So, how do you feel, kinda cranky?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
Plankton says: "Sorta surly?"
SpongeBob says: "Mm-mm."
Plankton says: "Maybe just a little bit jerky?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "I feel just how this cake tastes!"
SpongeBob says: "Absolutely delicious!"
Plankton says: "Hmm..."
Plankton says: "He must have gotten a piece without Jerktonium!"
Plankton says: "Here."
Plankton says: "Try some more."
SpongeBob says: "Don't mind if I do!"
Plankton says: "How's your dander?"
Plankton says: "Is it up?"
SpongeBob says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "How could I possibly be angry when my taste buds are swimming in Christmas cheer?"
Taste Bud says: "Oh, boy, here comes some more!"
Taste Bud says: "Yaaaay!"
Plankton says: "Grrr!"
Plankton says: "Have some more!"
Plankton says: "Well?"
SpongeBob says: "Well …  I think everyone should taste your amazing fruitcake!"
Plankton says: "You know what?"
Plankton says: "Knock yourself out."
SpongeBob says: "Hello, fellow revelers!"
SpongeBob says: "Would you like a Christmas treat?"
Bill says: "Why, sure, SpongeBob!"
Fish 2 says: "Yeah, who doesn't like treats?"
SpongeBob says: "Nothing loosens up the old pipes like some fruitcake."
SpongeBob says: "Dig in!"
They all take a piece.
Fish 2 says: "It's like a present for my mouth!"
SpongeBob says: "I knew you'd like it."
Bill says: "Hey!"
Bill says: "Did we come here to sing or eat fancy cake?"
Fish 2 says: "Whoa, calm down, Bill!"
Fish 2 says: "What do you want to sing?"
Bill says: "Well, I want to sing the only Christmas song that matters, and that's “Jingle Bells”."
Bill says: "From the top!"
Fish 3 says: "No, hold your holly!"
Fish 3 says: "We're singing the best Christmas song ever, and that's “Silver Bells”!"
Bill says: "Wrong bells, buddy!"
Fish 2 says: "Hey, I want to sing “Randolph the Red-Nosed Seahorse”!"
They all continue to argue.
SpongeBob says: "Great to see people so passionate about the holidays."
Plankton says: "What's all the racket?"
Plankton says: "What do you know?"
Plankton says: "The Jerktonium seems to work on these jerks."
Plankton says: "Very interesting."
Cut to a shot of a Christmas parade in town.
SpongeBob says: "Oh boy, a Christmas parade!"
SpongeBob says: "The perfect occasion to spread some mouthwatering joy."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, everyone, try some hot fruitcake today."
SpongeBob says: "Eat it all up and you will shout “Hooray!"
SpongeBob says: "”!"
Bikini Bottomites says: "Yay!"
SpongeBob says: "Everyone can get behind a mouthful of warm sunshine, everyone eat a Christmas time cliché."
SpongeBob says: "Everyone can get behind a mouthful of Christmas time, let's all eat some hot fruitcake today!"
Plankton says: "This just keeps getting better and better."
Costumed Santa says: "Ho ho ho!"
Costumed Santa says: "So, little boy, what would you like for Christmas?"
Boy says: "I want a sled and a truck and a bike and a train..."
SpongeBob says: "Hi, Santa!"
SpongeBob says: "Have some fruitcake."
Boy says: "And a water pistol and a helicopter and – and, uh..."

Boy says: "Whee-ee-ee!"
Boy says: "Oh, yeah."
Boy says: "And I want a trampoline!"
Plankton says: "Success!"
Plankton says: "Soon all the Bikini Bottomites will be jerks!"
Plankton says: "Now I just need to figure out what to do about old SpongeBoy."
Cut to Plankton's lab.
Karen says: "Once again your master plan is fatally flawed."
Karen says: "It seems that SpongeBob's innocent love of the holidays shields his heart from the effects of Jerktonium."
SpongeBob Diagram says: "Dahahaha!"
SpongeBob Diagram says: "That tickles."
Plankton says: "Drat!"
Plankton says: "That square-head's gonna throw my whole naughty to nice curve right off!"
Plankton says: "I guess it's time to introduce Plan B."

Mr. Krabs says: "What's goin' on out here?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob."
Plankton says: "Oh, SpongeBob, you've been a bad, bad toy!"
The mail truck is still spinning out of control and finally comes to rest. The bound and gagged mailman escapes and jumps away.
Patchy says: "I can't believe we survived that horrifying car accident without a scratch."
Patchy says: "Aw, here's the problem."
Patchy says: "Oh, that's not good."
Patchy says: "Flat tire, huh?"
Patchy says: "Looks as sad as an empty bag of beef."
Patchy says: "Brrr!"
Patchy says: "It's cold up here."
Patchy says: "Why don't you kids at home go make a nice hot cup of cocoa while Potty builds me a fire?"
End of part one; now to part two with a scene of Potty and Patchy huddled around a fire.
Potty says: "Squawk!"
Potty says: "What are you doing?"
Patchy says: "I'm sorry, Potty, I don't know what got into me."
Patchy says: "I'm just so hungry!"
Potty says: "It's okay, Patchy, I can't stay mad at you."
Patchy says: "Aww."
Patchy says: "Why are you looking at me like that, bird?"
Patchy says: "What are you doing?"
Cut to SpongeBob's storyline; SpongeBob is riding the dispenser through Bikini Bottom and comes across the three carolers he first gave Plankton's fruitcake to.
SpongeBob says: "Merry Christmas, fellas!"
Bill says: "Ah, go stuff a stocking!"
SpongeBob says: "Gee."
SpongeBob says: "That wasn't very nice."
SpongeBob says: "Seasons greetings, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Will you get some nerve, SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "This is comin' outta yer salary!"
SpongeBob says: "What's that all about?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Patrick!"
SpongeBob says: "What're you up to?"
Patrick says: "I think it's pretty obvious, SpongeBob!"
Patrick says: "I'm eating fruitcake and setting a tiger trap for Santa!"
Patrick says: "Now, if you don't mind, I'm kind of busy right now."
SpongeBob says: "Yeesh, okay."
SpongeBob says: "Don't have to be a jerk about it."
SpongeBob says: "Everybody's on edge today."
SpongeBob says: "Must be the holiday jitters."
Patrick says: "NosyPants."
The next morning, SpongeBob steps outside.
SpongeBob says: "Ah, Christmas Eve!"
SpongeBob says: "When all of Bikini Bottom is filled with good will."
Johnny says: "Merry Christmas, Frankie."
Frankie says: "Merry Christmas to you, too, Johnny."
SpongeBob says: "More like bad will!"
SpongeBob says: "Gosh, if people don't start acting nicer, Santa's going to fly right past Bikini Bottom this Christmas Eve!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm gonna need some help."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward!"
Squidward says: "I'm not home!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh gosh, what do I do now?"
Squidward says: "Why don't you go bother Sandy?"
SpongeBob says: "Good idea, Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I'll have to thank you when you get home."
Squidward says: "I said I'm not home!"
Cut to Sandy's treedome.
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "I need your help!"
SpongeBob says: "It's Christmas Eve and everyone in Bikini Bottom are acting like jerks!"
SpongeBob says: "You gotta help me find out why."
Sandy says: "Why should I help all them jerks?"
SpongeBob says: "Because those jerks don't care about Christmas any more, Sandy!"
SpongeBob says: "It's a problem."
Sandy says: "Problem?"
Sandy says: "My only problem is I'm out of fruitcake."
Sandy says: "Only thing I've got left to eat are boring old nuts."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, the problem isn't the fruitcake!"
SpongeBob says: "The problem is that everyone, including you, is acting like a jerk!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, I'll have to solve this on my own."
SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
Sandy says: "Dagnabbit, SpongeBob, you got fruitcake in my Christmas magic analyzer!"
Sandy says: "This is terrible!"
SpongeBob says: "What is it, Sandy?"
Sandy says: "The fruitcake is contaminated with Jerktonium!"
Sandy says: "No wonder I've been as ornery as a sidewinder on a hot driveway."
Sandy says: "Jerktonium is the orneriest element of them all and your fruitcake is full of it."
Sandy says: "Where'd you get that fruitcake, anyway?"
SpongeBob says: "From Plankton, he baked it."
Sandy says: "You took food from Plankton and fed it to everyone in town?"
Sandy says: "You're an idiot."
Sandy says: "No wonder everyone in town is a big old meanie."
SpongeBob says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "I've eaten tons of that fruitcake!"
SpongeBob says: "I must be the biggest jerk in town!"
Sandy says: "Why, this formula for the antidote don't make no sense at all!"
SpongeBob says: "Hmm… That's no formula!"
SpongeBob says: "It's a song!"
SpongeBob says: "Sandy, the song is the antidote!"
Cut to downtown Bikini Bottom, where people are still rioting.
Fish 6 says: "Oh yeah?"
Fish 6 says: "Well your fins are fat!"
SpongeBob says: "Ahoy, everybody!"
He snaps his fingers and mistletoe appears over the heads of the two fish he fed Plankton's fruitcake to, curing them of Jerktonium poisoning. He snaps again and a pile of presents appears, curing two other fish. A little boy begins to play Christmas baubles like bells.
SpongeBob says: "♪Bring joy to the world, it's the thing to do, but the world does not revolve around you."
SpongeBob says: "Don't be a jerk."
SpongeBob says: "It's Christmas!"
SpongeBob says: "When others are talking, never interrupt."
SpongeBob says: "Don't put people down or leave the toilet seat up."
SpongeBob says: "It's the time for families and holly and turkey."
SpongeBob says: "'Tis the season to be jolly, not jerky!"
SpongeBob's Friends says: "♪Jolly, not jerky!"
Co. says: "♪Jolly, not jerky!"
SpongeBob says: "♪Santa brought nearly every gift on your list."
SpongeBob says: "Why whine about the one that he missed?"
SpongeBob says: "Don't be a jerk, it's Christmas!"
SpongeBob says: "It's Christmas!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't be a jerk."
SpongeBob says: "It's Christmas!"
Sandy says: "Congratulations, SpongeBob, your song worked!"
SpongeBob says: "And not a moment too soon."
SpongeBob says: "Santa should be here any minute."
Mr. Krabs says: "You ain't kiddin'."
Mr. Krabs says: "Here he comes now!"
They all clear the way as Santa Claus' sleigh and reindeer land in front of the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob says: "Oh, boy!"
SpongeBob says: "Santa!"
SpongeBob says: "You made it!"
Santa says: "Whoa, ho, ho, ho, ho!"
Santa says: "Cool your jets there, son."
Santa says: "I'm afraid I'm the bearer of bad tidings."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, no!"
Santa says: "Oh, yes."
Santa says: "It seems you're all on my naughty list this year."
SpongeBob says: "Naughty list?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Santa says: "No buts about it."
Santa says: "You've all been a bunch of jerks."
SpongeBob says: "But---!"
Santa says: "But nothing."
Santa says: "Coal for everyone!"
Santa says: "Except Plankton."
SpongeBob says: "Wha-a-at!"
Friends says: "Wha-a-at!"
Co. says: "Wha-a-at!"
Santa says: "I'm just as surprised as you, but compared to the rest of you, he's been a saint."
Santa says: "Here you go, Sheldon, I believe this is what you asked for."
Mr. Krabs says: "Me secret formuler?"
Mr. Krabs says: "How did you get that?"
Santa says: "I have my ways."
An elf reaches into Mr Krabs' pocket and takes his wallet.
Pearl says: "Um..."
Pearl says: "Dad?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Huh?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Get out of me pocket, ya foul goblin!"
SpongeBob says: "But- but- but- but- but- but---!"
SpongeBob says: "But, Santa, you've got it all wrong!"
Santa says: "On the contrary, SpongeBob, you're the worst of all."
Santa says: "There you go, right now—"
Santa says: "wreaking havoc!"
The crowd parts and reveals the rampaging ToyBob.
Plankton says: "Uh-oh."
ToyBob says: "Destroy Santa."
SpongeBob says: "If you want Santa, you gotta get through me!"
Mega ToyBob says: "Okey-dokey."
Santa says: "Oh, my."
SpongeBob says: "Is that all you got?"
Mega ToyBob picks him up and flings him far away and releases a flame.
Santa says: "I'm outta here."
Santa says: "You do realize this counts as, naughty."
SpongeBob says: "You put that jolly elf down, you big tin imposter!"
SpongeBob says: "Hurry up, Santa, hop on!"
Mega ToyBob shorts out and explodes.
Santa says: "Thanks again for saving my keister."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, it was nothing."
Santa says: "You're clearly a very good lad, unlike the owner of that wind-up monstrosity."
Santa says: "What have we got there?"
Santa says: ""If found, please return to the Chum Bucket"?"
Santa says: "Plankton?!"
Santa says: "!"
Plankton says: "Uh-oh."
Mr. Krabs says: "Hand it over, Sheldon."
Mr. Krabs says: "Don't make it any worse."
Santa says: "O."
Santa says: "K."
Santa says: ", boys, let's give Plankton what he deserves."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, has anyone seen Patrick?"
Potty is still pecking Patchy's head.
Patchy says: "Santa's workshop?"
Patchy says: "I'm here, Santa!"
Patchy says: "I'm here!"
Potty says: "I'm not going in there."
Patchy says: "Santa!"
Santa says: "I think stealing a mail truck definitely counts as naughty."
Santa says: "Wouldn't you say, Potty?"
Potty says: "I sure would, Santa."
They laugh.
Both says: "Merry Christmas."
