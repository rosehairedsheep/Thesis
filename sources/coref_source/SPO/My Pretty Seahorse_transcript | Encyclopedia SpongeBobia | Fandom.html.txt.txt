SpongeBob says: "Hello, Squidward, isn't it a lovely day?"
Squidward says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Have you said hello to the flowers yet?"
SpongeBob says: "Gosh, I didn't know Squidward had hay fever."
SpongeBob says: "I'll do him the kindness and plant him some hypoallergenic flowers."
Narrator says: "Three days later..."
SpongeBob is still staring, but his eyes have shriveled up. He uses the water to make his eyes normal.
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "I'll take that as a yes!"
Squidward says: "What the..."
Squidward says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward!"
SpongeBob says: "Still riding a machine, I see!"
Squidward says: "Don't say anything, Squidward, remember your karma."
SpongeBob says: "Whoa, girl."
SpongeBob says: "Now you wait out here until I'm done with work."
SpongeBob says: "See you at the end of my shift."
Scooter says: "Hey, look, Mr."
Scooter says: "Krabs put in a kiddy ride!"

Scooter says: "I can't find the coin slot."
Scooter says: "Here it is!"
Wobbles says: "Help!"
Wobbles says: "Kiddy ride on the loose!"
Mr. Krabs says: "A monster scaring away me customers!"
SpongeBob says: "That's not a monster, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, it's a horse."
SpongeBob says: "She's my friend."
SpongeBob says: "Her name is Mystery."
Mr. Krabs says: "You're a mystery, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs says: "Get rid of it."
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
SpongeBob says: "Please, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, let her stay!"
SpongeBob says: "She won't hurt nobody nohow!"
Mr. Krabs says: "It's either you or Mystery."
SpongeBob says: "I knew I should've named her Debbie."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, thanks for finally getting rid of that horse!"
SpongeBob says: "You're welcome, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now, if we could just get rid of Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "Good one, sir."
Narrator says: "Twelve seconds later..."
SpongeBob says: "No, Mystery, you can't come out yet."
SpongeBob says: "If old man Krabs sees you, I'll lose my job."
SpongeBob says: "Shhh!"
SpongeBob says: "Girl, you got to be quiet or..."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob!"
Mr. Krabs says: "What was that?"
Mr. Krabs says: "Is that horse in here?"
SpongeBob says: "No, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs."
SpongeBob says: "I was just doing my imitation of Mystery."
SpongeBob says: "Weesnaw."
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, keep working on it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "That was terrible!"
SpongeBob says: "That was close."
Squidward says: "Huh?"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, where's my order?"
SpongeBob says: "Did you look under the tray?"
Squidward says: "No I didn't, sorry."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, could you just get my order?"
SpongeBob says: "They vanished."
Squidward says: "SpongeBob, there's no ghosts!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you Squidward."
SpongeBob says: "I'll be right back."
Squidward says: "What's that?"
SpongeBob says: "Don't tell Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "I got it all under control!"
SpongeBob says: "Now then, you were saying?"
Squidward says: "Just get my order."
SpongeBob says: "You got it, Squidward?"
SpongeBob says: "You ate Old Man Jenkins!"
Old Man Jenkins says: "I don't want to be a burden."
Squidward says: "Folks, we have a minor situation going on in the kitchen."
Thaddeus says: "Where's our food?"
Fred says: "I'm so hungry!"
Tina says: "This is my only lunch hour!"
Tom says: "Where's Old Man Jenkins?"
Squidward says: "Take it easy, the food's no good here, anyway."
Mr. Krabs says: "Squidward, what's going on in here?"
Squidward says: "Why don't you go ask CowBob RanchPants and his faithful companion Sir Eats-A-Lot?"
SpongeBob says: "Mystery got a belly-ache from eating Krabby Patties, so I made her a bicarbonate of soda."
Old Man Jenkins says: "What did I miss?"
Mr. Krabs says: "So, my eyes are correct!"
Mr. Krabs says: "You still have that horse even after I ordered you to get rid of it!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Well, now I'm going to get rid of it once and for all!"
SpongeBob says: "No, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs!"
SpongeBob says: "Don't make me give up Mystery!"
SpongeBob says: "I know you think she's just a horse, but she's more than that, I tell you."
SpongeBob says: "She listens to me."
SpongeBob says: "She understands everything I say and I understand her!"
SpongeBob says: "She's my best friend!"
Squidward says: "Hey, who left this bowl of onions here?"
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, your story has touched me heart."
Mr. Krabs says: "Believe it or not, I know what it's like to give up a best friend."
SpongeBob says: "You do?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I was 5 years old and me father gave me a dollar."
Mr. Krabs says: "I loved that dollar."
Mr. Krabs says: "Loved it like a brother."
Mr. Krabs says: "Me and that dollar went everywhere together."
SpongeBob says: "What happened to the dollar, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs?"
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "Would you get out of here?"
Mr. Krabs says: "The point is, son, sometimes, you have to set things free even though it's hard."
SpongeBob says: "Alright, Mr."
SpongeBob says: "Krabs, I understand."
Nat Peterson says: "Hey!"
SpongeBob says: "Okay, girl, you're free to go."
SpongeBob says: "Well, she's gone and I'll never see her again."
Mr. Krabs says: "It's okay, son."
Mr. Krabs says: "You did the proper thing."
Mr. Krabs says: "She's free now and we have no right to separate that wild animal from her natural habitat."
Squidward says: "Hey, Mr."
Squidward says: "Krabs, looks like old Mystery had an after-dinner salad!"
SpongeBob says: "Mystery!"
Mr. Krabs says: "Come back!"
SpongeBob says: "Mystery!"
SpongeBob says: "Weesnaw!"
Both says: "Mystery, come back here!"
The scene cuts to Patrick, who still has the board attached to his head, trying to enter a hat shop, but the board keeps bumping on the sides of the entrance repeatedly as the screen fades to black, ending the episode.
