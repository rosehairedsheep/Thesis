Squidward comes out from his house and breathes happily.
Squidward says: "Another beautiful Sunday in Bikini Bottom."
Squidward says: "Nothing can ruin my good mood today!"
SpongeBob says: "Good morning, Squidward!"
Officer John says: "Aha!"
Squidward says: "Bugs..."
Squidward says: "litter..."
Squidward says: "litter..."
Squidward says: "bugs."
Officer John says: "Hey, you!"
Officer John says: "Did you throw this gum away?"
Squidward says: "Yes I did, and I like to complain!"
Officer John says: "Ah..."
Officer John says: "So you admit that you are a litterbug?"
Squidward says: "I do..."
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "No no, I just stepped in it!"
Officer John says: "Oh, you sure did, buddy."
Officer John says: "You disgust me..."
Officer John says: "Maybe this will teach you not to treat the world as your own personal trash can!"
Squidward says: ""Bikini Bottom P."
Squidward says: "D."
Squidward says: "Ticket for littering."
Squidward says: "Penalty: Community service"?!"
Squidward says: "!"
Squidward says: "Stupid policeman, I'm no litter bug!"
Squidward says: "Hey!"
Squidward says: "No more trash!"
Squidward says: "Looks like I'm done!"
Thug Fish says: "Here, you can have mine."
Squidward says: "Can things get any worse?"
Squilliam says: "Of course they can!"
Squidward says: "Daagh!"
Squidward says: "Squilliam Fancyson!"
Squidward says: "My arch foe from band class!"
Squilliam says: "Stuck doing community service, eh?"
Squilliam says: "Court ordered?"
Squidward says: "No!"
Squidward says: "I..."
Squidward says: "um..."
Squidward says: "I'm..."
Squidward says: "volunteering!"
Squidward says: "Yeah, I'm cleaning up Bikini Bottom, selflessly devoting my time to a worthy cause."
Squilliam says: "Oooh!"
Squilliam says: "Maybe if you clean up Bikini Bottom, they'll build a statue of you!"
Squilliam says: "Oh, wait!"
Squilliam says: "They've already built one..."
Squilliam says: "of me!"
Squilliam says: "I cleaned up all of Bikini Bottom in one week."
Mable Monica says: "Bless you, Squilliam Fancyson!"
Mable Monica says: "Bless you!"
Squidward says: "Hmph!"
Squidward says: "I'll clean up Bikini Bottom in a day!"
Squilliam says: "Ooh!"
Squilliam says: "Let me help you out."
Officer John walks by, growls when he sees the tissue and writes another ticket for Squidward. Later, Squidward is picking up trash.
Squidward says: "Squilliam thinks he's sooo amazing!"
Taylor says: "Whoops!"
Squidward uses the wagon for keeping the trash and an old lady walks out.
Mabel says: "Oh is it trash day?"
Mabel says: "I thought it was Tuesday!"
Squidward says: "What?"
Squidward says: "No!"
Mabel says: "Hey everybody, it's trash day!"
Other Fish says: "Trash day?!"
Other Fish says: "!"
Squidward says: "Hey!"
Squidward says: "Hold on!"
Squidward says: "Stop!"
Squidward says: "I'm not the garbage man!"
Squidward says: "Help."
SpongeBob says: "I'll help you Squidward!"
Squidward says: "Why are you in a trash bag?"
SpongeBob says: "I wanted to study the complete life cycle of a Krabby Patty."
SpongeBob says: "I could get rid of your trash, Squidward!"
Squidward says: "No thank you!"
Squidward says: "I'll do it myself."
SpongeBob says: "Please let me help!"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Please?"
Squidward says: "No."
SpongeBob says: "Pretty please?"
Squidward says: "No way!"
SpongeBob says: "Pretty please with candy sprinkles on top?"
Squidward says: "Listen closely, I don't need your help!"
Squidward says: "I would rather be beaten to a pulp!"
Taylor says: "That's him, mommy!"
Taylor says: "That's the man who stole my wagon!"
Taylor says: "Beat him to a pulp!"
Taylor's mother says: "Hmmm!"
SpongeBob says: "Hi, lady!"
The muscular mother beats up Squidward, dumps the trash on Squidward and leaves with her son and his wagon. The officer shakes his head in disapproval and writes another ticket for Squidward.
SpongeBob says: "Can I help you now?"
Squidward says: "Alright!"
Squidward says: "Fine!"
Squidward says: "You can help me."
SpongeBob says: "Thank you, Squidward."
Squidward says: "Well..."
Squidward says: "you gonna help me!"
Squidward says: "?"
SpongeBob says: "First, close your eyes!"
Squidward says: "Why?"
SpongeBob says: "C'mon!"
Squidward says: "Fine!"
Squidward says: "Now what?"
SpongeBob says: "No peeking."
Squidward says: "Oh brother."
SpongeBob says: "Okay!"
SpongeBob says: "You can open your eyes now!"
Squidward says: "Oh this is so stuuuuuu..."
Squidward says: "..."
Squidward says: "pid."
Squidward says: "It's gone!"
Squidward says: "Where did you put the trash?"
SpongeBob says: "I put it in..."
Squidward says: "Know what?"
Squidward says: "Don't care!"
Squidward says: "The trash is gone."
Squidward says: "Thanks, SpongeBob."
Squidward says: "I hate you a little less now."
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, that..."
SpongeBob says: "that's a beautiful thing to say!"
Squidward and SpongeBob walk to their houses.
Squidward says: "Well, I don't know how you did it, but thank you for getting rid of all that trash."
Squidward says: "They'll have that statue of me built in no time!"
Squidward says: "My house!"
Officer John says: "Is this yours?"
Squidward says: "Yes."
SpongeBob says: "I am angry?"
SpongeBob says: "Squidward, why are you angry?"
Squidward says: "SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "Yes."
Squidward says: "What's this?"
SpongeBob says: "Your garbage."
Squidward says: "Where's my house?"
SpongeBob says: "On top of your garbage."
SpongeBob says: "So I bought it here."
Squidward says: "How?"
SpongeBob says: "Like this."
Squidward says: "Of all the garbage that comes out of your mouth, this is the least annoying."
SpongeBob says: "Hey, Squidward..."
Squidward says: "Wait!"
Squidward says: "Wait!"
Squidward says: "Zip it!"
Squidward says: "I have an idea!"
Officer John says: "Are you SpongeBob SquarePants?"
Squidward says: "Neptune no!"
Squidward says: "They were gonna build a statue of me!"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, a statue, eh?"
Squidward says: "What is that?!"
Squidward says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Your very own statue!"
Squidward says: "Garbage."
Squidward says: "I'm made of garbage."
SpongeBob says: "You sure are!"
Squilliam says: "My glorious statue!"
Officer John says: "This is your statue?"
Squilliam says: "It was."
Squidward says: "Ha!"
Squidward says: "Thanks, SpongeBob!"
Officer John coughs to catch Squidward's attention and a can falls down from the statue. The officer gives Squidward and SpongeBob a ticket.
