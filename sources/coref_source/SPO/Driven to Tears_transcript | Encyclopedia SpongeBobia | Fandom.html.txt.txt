SpongeBob says: "Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?"
Patrick says: "Right here, buddy."
Patrick says: "Mmm."
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Hey, learning tastes good."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, I needed those."
Patrick says: "Oh, fiddlesticks."
Patrick says: "You've taken that driving test more times than anyone."
SpongeBob says: "57 times."
Patrick says: "Well, then 58 is your lucky number."
Patrick says: "You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner."
SpongeBob says: "I'm a winner?"
Patrick says: "Who's a winner?"
SpongeBob says: "I'm a winner."
Patrick says: "Who's a winner?"

Patrick says: "Who's a winner?!"
Patrick says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm a winner!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm a winner!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm a winner!"
Narrator says: "One minute thirty seven seconds later..."
Patrick says: "How'd you do, winner?"
Patrick says: "Let's see that license."
SpongeBob says: "I didn't get a license, Patrick."
Patrick says: "Are they gonna mail it to you?"
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick, I failed the boating test."
SpongeBob says: "I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all."
Patrick says: "No way!"
Patrick says: "58 is, like, the luckiest number ever!"
Patrick says: "The test must be rigged."
SpongeBob says: "Let's just go home, Patrick."
Patrick says: "We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this."
Patrick says: "I'm taking that test, myself."
Patrick says: "Please, SpongeBob."
Patrick says: "I think I know what I'm doing."
SpongeBob says: "No, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "No!"
Mrs. Puff says: "Good morning."
Patrick says: "You're not the judge of me!"

Patrick says: "How do I look?"
SpongeBob says: "Like a winner."
Miss Shell says: "Ready?"
Patrick says: "Ready."
SpongeBob says: "Huh?"
Fish says: "Congratulations, Mr."
Fish says: "Star."
Fish says: "You're the one millionth person to pass the test."
Patrick says: "Does that mean I get a free key chain?"
Fish says: "Uhh, no."
Patrick says: "Oh."
Fish says: "You get a brand-new boat mobile."
Fish says: "The new Bass Blaster 3000."
Fish says: "The ultimate boating machine."
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
Patrick says: "All right!"
Fish says: "Women will want you."
Patrick says: "Isn't this great?"

SpongeBob says: "Whoa!"
Patrick says: "The horn works."
Patrick says: "Woo!"
Patrick says: "This is the greatest day ever."
Patrick says: "Right, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob says: "Right, Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "I can't think of one thing that would make this day better."
SpongeBob says: "Except maybe getting my license."
Patrick says: "Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license."
SpongeBob says: "Two millionth?"
Patrick says: "Then you can get a free boat just like me."
SpongeBob says: "Yeah, just like you."
Patrick says: "I try to serve as an inspiration to others."
SpongeBob says: "Can we go home now?"
SpongeBob says: "We've been driving around your house for hours."
Patrick says: "I know."
Patrick says: "It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it?"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for the ride, Patrick."
Patrick says: "No problem, buddy."
Patrick says: "You can't help being a..."
Patrick says: "pedestrian."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what are you doing?"
Patrick says: "I'm trying to work on my boat mobile."
Patrick says: "Now could you keep it down?"
Patrick says: "It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep."
SpongeBob says: "4:00?"
SpongeBob says: "Now what is it, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "You will never guess what happen to me today."
SpongeBob says: "You got your license."
Patrick says: "Yeah!"
Patrick says: "But that's not all."
SpongeBob says: "You got a new boat."
Patrick says: "Yeah."
Patrick says: "Have you been following me?"
Patrick says: "You know, you need to get your own life."
Gary says: "Meow."
SpongeBob says: "Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat."
Patrick says: "Hey, buddy."
Patrick says: "Need a ride to work?"
SpongeBob says: "Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work."
Patrick says: "Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license."
SpongeBob says: "Thanks for the ride."
Patrick says: "No problem, buddy."
Patrick says: "You can give me rides once you get your license."
Patrick says: "I mean, if you get your license."
SpongeBob says: "That's it."
SpongeBob says: "I am through driving around with Patrick."
SpongeBob says: "If I have to see one more boat mobile..."
Mr. Krabs says: "SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru."
SpongeBob says: "When did we get a drive-thru?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days."
Mr. Krabs says: "They don't have time to sit down and eat."
Mr. Krabs says: "They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams."
SpongeBob says: "I used to have a dream."
Mr. Krabs says: "Yeah?"
Mr. Krabs says: "I used to have a kidney stone."
Mr. Krabs says: "Everything passes eventually."
Mr. Krabs says: "Now stop dreaming and work for a living."
Patrick says: "The horn still works."
Patrick says: "Hey, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob says: "What's with the helmet, Patrick?"
Patrick says: "Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image."
SpongeBob says: "Uh-huh."
Patrick says: "Boy, driving is so easy."
SpongeBob says: "Oh?"
Patrick says: "Do you want me to give you lessons?"
SpongeBob says: "Oh, that would be great."
Patrick says: "Oh!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
Patrick says: "Hi, mommy."
Patrick says: "Hi, daddy."
Mr. SquarePants says: "Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you?"
Mr. SquarePants says: "We're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours."
Patrick says: "What?"
Patrick says: "I'm an orphan?"
Patrick says: "Oh, but guess what?"
Patrick says: "I passed my driver's test."
Mrs. SquarePants says: "That's great, Patrick."
Patrick says: "SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it."
Mrs. SquarePants says: "Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield."
SpongeBob says: "Mom!"
Patrick says: "Well, I've got to take Mr."
Patrick says: "Walks-a-lot back home."
Patrick says: "He's always asking for rides."
SpongeBob says: "Hey!"
Mr. SquarePants says: "Even Patrick has a license."
Patrick says: "Let's see what this baby can do."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph."
Patrick says: "Yeah, yeah."
Patrick says: "What?"
Patrick says: "Where?"
Patrick says: "Who?"
SpongeBob says: "Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the driver of this vehicle is speeding."
SpongeBob says: "Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?"
Officer says: "Umm..."
Officer says: "okay."
SpongeBob says: "Are you sure you don't want to run him in?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, you just ran three red lights!"
Patrick says: "So?"
SpongeBob says: "You're suppose to stop!"
Patrick says: "I think the driving genius knows what he's doing."
SpongeBob says: "Driving genius?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
SpongeBob says: "Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn..."
SpongeBob says: "through an orphanage?!"
SpongeBob says: "!"
Patrick says: "They ran for it in time."
Patrick says: "What are you so mad about?"
SpongeBob says: "I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!"
Patrick says: "How can you say that?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license!"
SpongeBob says: "If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!"
Patrick says: "I'm not rubbing my license in your face!"
Patrick says: "This is rubbing my license in your face!"
Officer says: "Huh, litterbugs."
Officer says: "This is why I joined the force."
SpongeBob says: "It's the police!"
Patrick says: "It's the police!"
Officer says: "Pull it over, litterbug!"
Patrick says: "Litterbug?!"
Patrick says: "!"
Patrick says: "No!"
Officer says: "Ooh, I got me a runner."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick, what do you think you're doing?"
Patrick says: "I don't know!"
Patrick says: "I don't have a license anymore."
Judge says: "90 days."
Judge says: "I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering."
Patrick says: "So long, buddy."
Patrick says: "Don't forget to feed Gary."
Patrick says: "Sometimes you forget to feed him."
SpongeBob says: "What have I done?"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick can't survive in prison."
SpongeBob says: "He's too soft."
SpongeBob says: "Wait!"
SpongeBob says: "Patrick's innocent."
SpongeBob says: "I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window."
SpongeBob says: "I'm the litterbug."
SpongeBob says: "Take me instead."
Judge says: "Well, considering there's no legal precedent..."
Judge says: "oh, what the heck."
Judge says: "90 days!"
Narrator says: "One debt to society later..."
SpongeBob says: "Patrick!"
Patrick says: "SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob says: "I'm glad you passed the test."
SpongeBob says: "I'm glad you have a license."
SpongeBob says: "And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever."
SpongeBob says: "Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy."
Patrick says: "Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore."
SpongeBob says: "What?"
Patrick says: "It stopped working so I threw it away."
Patrick says: "The needle was on E and I figured that must mean end."
SpongeBob says: "Oh, then what do we do with this?"
Patrick says: "How's that?"
SpongeBob says: "Yeah!"
Patrick says: "Ready, buddy?"
SpongeBob says: "Ready, pal."
SpongeBob says: "Woo!"
SpongeBob says: "Woo!"
