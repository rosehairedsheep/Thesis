Open on King flicking through channels on a crystal ball.
Blond Romance Lead says: "I love you."
Villain says: "There you are."
Principal Bump says: "Oh, hi."
Cut to the stream on the crystal ball, Bump in his office. Static crosses the screen sporadically.
Principal Bump says: "I didn't see you there."
Principal Bump says: "Iâ€™m Principal Hieronymous Bump, and welcome to Hexside School of Magic and Demonics, where our students' safety and well-being is our top priority."
Outside the window, several students fly on broomsticks away from giant tentacles.
Principal Bump says: "Let's take a tour."
Star transition to a trophy shelf, Bump walking up to it.
Principal Bump says: "Here at Hexside, we are devoted to providing the very best for our students."
Slide transition to the photo class classroom.
Principal Bump says: "From our state of the art classrooms..."
Principal Bump's torso flies off screen in a shower of glitter. The spiders in the classroom all attack a screaming Mattholomule, who has a Healing patch on his face. Text reading Learning flies across the screen. Spiral transition to the cafeteria.
Principal Bump says: "..."
Principal Bump says: "to our award-winning cafeteria."
Mattholomule, now with an arm in a cast and sling, hesitantly takes the cover off the platter. It's normal food. The plant that Bo is eating across from him attacks his face, knocking him off the bench. She continues chewing, undisturbed. A cafeteria worker slides past the screen, transitioning to outside of Hexside.
Principal Bump says: "Every student has the ability and support to reach their full potential here."
Principal Bump says: "Hexside, where the magic of friendship, is no longer taught here due to budget constraints."
