Open on Luz taping a drawing onto the fridge of her hugging Eda, who's drawing a spell circle, and King with sunglasses standing next to them.
Luz says: "Pretty good, huh?"
Eda says: "What did you use to draw this?"
Luz says: "Well, it’s a common misconception that the tool is an important part of the process."
Luz says: "As long as you’ve mastered the basics..."
Eda says: "Hey, that’s my lipstick."
Luz draws Owlbert on her hand, then moves it to make it look like his wings are flapping.
Luz says: "Hoot, hoot."
Luz says: "Then you can use pretty much anything to make a good drawing."
Luz runs over to the table. She draws a bat monster with baby bats on a piece of bread with a bottle of mustard, then a skateboarding cat on a piece of paper with chalk. She grabs an oven mitt and runs over to the stove, flipping a pan there to reveal a pancake that looks like the Good Witch Azura, who winks.
Luz says: "Yep, with practice and study, you can make fine art out of anything."
Eda says: "Yeah, yeah."
Eda says: "I mostly ask because I left a cursed pencil lying around here somewhere, and..."
The drawing on the fridge glows orange where Luz, Eda, and King used to be. Cut to a cackling drawn-Luz, holding a knife. She jumps onto the stove, where drawn-Eda grabs the Azura pancake and tosses it in a blender. She doesn't put a lid on before turning it on and makes a mess. Cut to drawn-King tossing a skull through a small window, breaking the wall in the process.
Luz says: "I guess it does matter what tool you use."
Eda says: "Yeah, I'll go get the paper shredder."
