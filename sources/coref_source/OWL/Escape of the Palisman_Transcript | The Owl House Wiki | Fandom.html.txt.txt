Open on a playground in the middle of Bonesborough. Several baby-track Hexside students are there. A sign at the front gate reads "THE SLAYGROUND funded by the Bonesborough department of parks & wreck". Cut to a sign above a bench that reads "ALL BLOODTHIRSTY MONSTERS MUST BE LEASHED." Eda and Luz are sitting on a bench under the sign.
Luz says: "My parental instincts are freaking out, man."
Eda says: "He's fine."
Eda says: "Look at him."
Cut to King trying to climb the slide.
Luz says: "It does look like he's having fun."
Luz says: "Aw."
Luz says: "I wonder what cute little game he's playing."
King says: "Stand back, cretins."
King says: "Yes!"
King says: "Yes!"
King says: "This is a throne worthy of a tyrant."
King says: "Bow to me you snotty underlings."
King says: "Bow!"
Kids says: "Okay."
One does a handstand while the other does a backbend.
King says: "Yes, appease your master."
Usurper says: "This isn't for standing, it's for sliding."
Usurper says: "You try."
King says: "Whoa, whoa!"
King says: "Eda!"
King says: "That monster took my throne."
Eda says: "You mean the baby?"
King says: "No, the usurper."
King says: "I want you to go over there and blow him up."
King says: "Kaboom!"
Usurper says: "Kaboom!"
Eda says: "Yeah, I'm not using Owlbert to blow up a five‐year‐old."
Eda says: "He's got better things to do."
Eda says: "Like this..."
Luz says: "Aw, what a sweetie."
Luz says: "How did you get him?"
Eda says: "Get?"
Eda says: "I made Owlbert from the branch of an ancient tree."
Eda says: "Oh, he's my palisman and we're bonded for life."
Eda says: "I'd annihilate anyone who'd hurt him."
King says: "Fine."
King says: "Don't help."
King says: "Revenge will taste all the sweeter if they fall by my hand alone."
Eda says: "Oh, man."
Eda says: "Here we go."
Eda says: "King's squeak of rage."
Owlbert scratches at his face.
Luz says: "Hey, what's that?"
Eda says: "That's his interlock."
Eda says: "So he only fits on to my staff."
Eda says: "Every palisman has one."
As she speaks, everything but her, her staff, and the bench disappears.
Eda says: "Luz?"
She stands and looks around the void. Both her staff and the bench disappear.
Eda says: "Hello?"
Luz says: "Eda?"
Eda says: "Luz!"
The real world returns as Luz and Owlbert look over Eda.
Luz says: "Eda!"
Luz says: "Eda!"
Luz says: "Wake up!"
Eda's eyes open. She is now laying down on the bench.
Luz says: "Are you all right?"
Luz says: "King we have to go!"
King says: "Five more minutes, please!"
Luz says: "King!"
King says: "Ah, man."
King says: "This isn't over."
Usurper says: "Okay, let's play again real soon."
King says: "No, no."
King says: "Keep those sticky hands away!"
King says: "Oh, no!"
King says: "He's touching me!"
THEME.
Cut to the Owl House, where Eda tosses her staff to the couch.
Luz says: "I'll go get your elixir."
Eda says: "Don't worry about it."
Eda says: "I'll get it myself in a bit."
Luz says: "Do you need me to stay home and take care of you?"
Luz says: "I could put King in a little doctor's outfit."
Everyone looks at King, who looks up from a stack of paper.
King says: "Meh?"
Eda says: "No one wants to see that."
Luz says: "I do."
Eda says: "Look, I know how to take care of myself."
Eda says: "I've had this curse longer than you've been alive."
Luz says: "So, how'd you get it?"
Eda says: "I don't know."
Luz says: "You don't know?"
Eda says: "Somebody gave it to me."
Eda says: "I don't know who and I don't care because I'm fine, all right?"
Eda says: "Anyway, don't you have plans with Tweedledum and Twerpledee?"
Luz says: "Well, Willow, Gus, and I are going to the Grudgby game between Hexside and Glandus High."
Eda says: "Since when are you into sports?"
Luz says: "Since I found a little something called "Hexside Pride."
Luz says: ""  To think that Glandus, whoever they are, would dare face us."
Luz says: "But if you need me to stay..."
Eda says: "Gross."
Eda says: "Sympathy."
Eda says: "Go!"
Eda says: "Go have fun at sport."
Luz says: "Hooray!"
Luz says: "Hooray for sport!"
Luz says: "Hugs and kisses, King."
Luz says: "Mwah!"
Luz says: "Don't spend all night plotting revenge."
King says: "That drooly‐faced heathen will know my wrath."
Cut to Hexside, where students are lined up to get on a dragon bus. Luz is running toward it but not paying attention.
Luz says: "Hexside's gonna wreck your side."
Luz says: "Ah!"
Luz says: "Friends."
Willow says: "Whoo‐hoo!"
Luz says: "Whoo‐hoo!"
Gus says: "Game day roar!"
Luz says: "Happy game day, fellow, uh..."
Luz says: "Are we Hexidians?"
Luz says: "Hexies?"
Luz says: "Hexoleos?"
Willow says: "Actually, most people call us..."
Willow says: "winners."
Gus says: "Grudgby games are the best."
Gus says: "The players go through these action‐packed trials."
Gus says: "And the audience gets to wave flags."
Gus says: "Look, I practiced."
He pulls out two flags, turns in a circle as he waves them and hums.
Luz says: "Is it weird that I'm not wearing anything Hexside?"
Willow says: "Um, it's weirder that you're wearing Glandus colors."
Giant Boy says: "Get ready to be creamed, Glandus nerd."
Luz says: "Hey!"
Luz says: "I'm a Hexside nerd."
Luz says: "Gotta change out of this shirt."
Luz says: "Where can I get a Hexside one?"
Gus says: "I know."
Gus says: "There's a lost and found box in the cafeteria."
Luz says: "Ah!"
Luz says: "The lost and found."
Luz says: "Where mouthguards go to retire."
Cut to the lost and found, a giant chest. Luz opens it and pulls out a hat.
Luz says: "Yes!"
Cut to the front doors of Hexside, which Luz exits in full Hexside apparel waving pom-poms.
Luz says: "Goooo, Hexside!"
Luz says: "Well, I never did that before."
Luz says: "Uh, where is everyone?"
The dragon bus is flying away.
Giant Boy says: "Hexside rules!"
Luz says: "Oh, no!"
Luz says: "Come back!"
Luz says: "Why didn't you guys board the bus?"
Willow says: "We weren't going to leave you behind."
Gus says: "I was."
Willow says: "Gus!"
Luz says: "Can we walk to Glandus?"
Gus says: "We'd never make it in time."
Gus says: "Glandus is..."
Gus says: "all the way out in the middle of the island."
Luz says: "Typical Glandus."
Willow says: "And my parents are working, otherwise I'd see if they could give us a ride on their staff."
Luz says: "A staff..."
Luz says: "because staffs fly."
Luz says: "Of course."
Luz says: "I can get us a staff."
Gus says: "You can?"
Luz says: "Yes, come on."
Luz grabs Willow's hand and runs. Gus leaps after them. Cut to the doors of Eda's bedroom.
King says: "Eda!"
King says: "Great news."
King says: "I thought of the perfect way to get revenge on that usurper."
King says: "Now, don't be put off by the complicated premise."
King says: "I'll break it down for you in small pieces."
King says: "Huh?"
Eda, almost completely in her Owl Beast form, is sitting in her nest. She growls and advances on King.
King says: "Stay back!"
King says: "Did you just listen to me?"
King says: "Uh, come here."
King says: "Sit."
King says: "Oh, this is an interesting development."
King says: "Eda's only partially transformed which means she's totally suggestible."
King says: "Yes."
King says: "Yes!"
King says: "I think this will do nicely."
King says: "Forget fire."
King says: "I've got a greater force to unleash."
King says: "You!"
King says: "You're going to help me regain my throne."
King says: "I mean, if that's okay with you."
King says: "Right?"
King says: "I'll take that weird grumble as a yes."
King says: "I'm just gonna grab a little bottle of elixir in case you go rogue on me."
He grabs a full bottle of elixir and a messenger bag. Several empty bottles fall out of the bag as he drags it.
King says: "Now, to destiny's battlefield: the playground!"
Luz says: "King, are you home?"
King says: "What?"
King says: "Sit."
King says: "Stay."
Luz says: "Is Eda up?"
King says: "That Eda."
King says: "No, no."
King says: "She is out like a light."
King says: "Oh, man."
King says: "Can she snore."
Luz says: "Oh, no."
Luz says: "I wanted to ask if I could borrow her staff but I know she needs her rest."
King says: "Oh, I'm sure it's fine."
King says: "It's fine."
King says: "Just take it."
Luz says: "I can't."
Luz says: "Not without Eda's permission."
King says: "Well, there's your permission."
King says: "Off you go."
Luz says: "I really owe Gus and Willow one."
Luz says: "And it's just for the afternoon."
Luz says: "I'm sure Eda wouldn't mind."
King says: "Not our generous, kindhearted Eda."
King says: "Big heart on her."
They stare at each other for a second.
Luz says: "I'll be back soon."
King says: "Close call."
Luz says: "What?"
King says: "Nothing."
Luz says: "Oh, okay."
King says: "Close call."
King says: "And now revenge."
King says: "Right, Owl Eda?"
King says: "I'm feeling confident about this plan."
Cut to the front of the Owl House as Luz opens the door.
Luz says: "To Glandus High."
She gestures with the staff, hitting Owlbert against the house.
Luz says: "Oh!"
Luz says: "Sorry, Owlbert."
Luz says: "It's okay."
Luz says: "We're just on our way to help some friends."
Willow says: "Ooh!"
Gus says: "Ooh!"
Luz says: "Who's ready to board Air Luz?"
They all board the staff.
Willow says: "Feel that power‐to‐weight ratio."
Gus says: "Boys, prepare to fly."
Luz says: "Next stop, Glandus High."
Luz says: "Let's go."
The staff rises in the air.
Luz says: "Step on it, Owlbert."
She slaps the staff.
All says: "Whoa!"
All says: "Whoa!"
The staff does a loop-de-loop, then runs into several trees.
They hit a tree head on. Willow and Gus fall directly into a bush. Luz gets caught on a branch, then falls out of her hoodie.
Owlbert falls directly on top of his head. He looks at his now cracked head and hoots.
Luz says: "Is everyone okay?"
Luz says: "Huh?"
Luz says: "Oh, no."
Luz says: "Oh, no, no, no!"
Luz says: "Owlbert, come back!"
Cut to Luz, Willow, and Gus running through the forest.
Luz says: "Owlbert!"
Owlbert hoots as he flies into a foreboding cave.
Gus says: "Man, humans can run."
Gus says: "Must be their dorsal fins."
Luz says: "He went through those trees."
Luz says: "Come on."
Willow says: "We have to be careful."
Willow says: "It's really easy to get lost in this part of the forest."
Luz says: "This is Eda's palisman, Willow."
Luz says: "She'll kill me if we don't get it back."
Luz says: "Let's go."
Cut to the inside of the cave. Bats screech as they enter. Bones crunch under their feet.
Willow says: "Wow."
Willow says: "I keep stepping on a lot of crunchy twigs."
Luz says: "Those are bones, Willow."
Willow says: "Not if I never look down."
A shadow passes them.
Luz says: "This isn't any kind of forest I'm used to."
Willow says: "That's because this isn't a forest."
The Bat Queen's kids chirp as they approach the teens.
Willow says: "It's a nest."
Luz says: "Hey, I remember you."
Luz says: "You're Bat Queen's babies."
Gus says: "Wait."
Gus says: "The Bat Queen?"
Willow says: "I think I'd rather take my chances with Eda."
Luz says: "Uh, we're looking for a little owl and..."
Luz says: "There he is."
Owlbert is standing a bit behind the bat babies.
Luz says: "Owlbert, thank goodness you're okay."
Luz says: "Come here, buddy."
Luz says: "Time to go home."
The Bat Queen steps in front of Owlbert and into the light.
Bat Queen says: "Hello, small human."
Cut to the Slayground.
One kid makes a sandcastle in the sandbox. Loud footsteps knock it down.
King says: "Ahem!"
Eda, King on her back, is sitting on the roof of a house.
King says: "Listen carefully."
King says: "You all have two choices."
Braxas says: "Ah!"
Braxas says: "A monster."
The kids all flee.
King says: "Good enough."
King says: "Whoa!"
Eda jumps off the roof.
King says: "Run!"
King says: "Despair!"
King says: "Your time has ended."
King says: "Mine begins."
King says: "Not so tough now, you spongy hatchlings."
King says: "I will eat you."
King says: "All who stood in my way are gone."
King says: "I declare myself despotic ruler of this land."
King says: "Huh?"
King says: "Hmm?"
Eda is eating the slide.
King says: "Hey."
King says: "Whoa, whoa!"
King says: "No eating the throne."
Eda looks longingly at the slide.
King says: "Noooo!"
King says: "Stop that!"
Cut back to the Bat Queen's nest.
Willow says: "It's the..."
Luz says: "Bat Queen."
Luz says: "I know."
Luz says: "We kinda babysat her kids once."
Luz says: "Don't worry."
Luz says: "I got this."
Luz says: "they're as hideous as ever."
Gus says: "You know, that coulda gone worse."
Luz says: "So..."
Luz says: "Owlbert ran away and I need to get him back."
Luz says: "I'm just gonna grab him and we'll be on our way."
Bat Queen puts a claw on Luz's chest.
Luz says: "Ah!"
Bat Queen says: "To be careless with a staff, it's very serious."
Bat Queen says: "I protect him."
Luz says: "And thank you for that, uh, but he belongs to Eda, the Owl Lady."
Luz says: "And you owe her a favor, remember?"
Bat Queen says: "Owl Lady is careless."
Bat Queen says: "Her staff left her sight."
Bat Queen says: "Taken by human who steals, hurts, frightens..."
Luz says: "Huh?"
Bat Queen says: "He told me all."
Bat Queen's eyes glow yellow. Owlbert's glow the same color.
Luz says: "Owlbert, I never meant to hurt you."
Luz says: "Please trust me."
Both their eyes glow again. Luz stands.
Bat Queen says: "Trust must be earned..."
Bat Queen says: "..."
Bat Queen says: "through trials!"
Fire bursts from the ground with the final word.
Gus says: "Trials?"
Willow says: "Luz, the Bat Queen is well‐known for her impossible trials."
Willow says: "I've never heard of anyone winning against her."
Luz says: "But I have to get Owlbert back."
Luz says: "I accept your challenge."
Willow says: "And we'll be right there with you."
Gus says: "Let the flags raise you up."
Bat Queen closes her claw. Webs encase Willow and Gus.
Gus says: "Hey!"
Willow says: "What?"
Bat Queen says: "No helpsies."
Bat Queen says: "Now, let the trials begin."
Bat Queen says: "Milk the spider demon."
A spider with udders approaches Luz, holding a bucket.
Luz says: "All right."
Luz says: "Come here, pal."
Luz says: "Let's do this."
Luz says: "If you run you'll just make this harder for yourself."
Cut to one of the flames extinguishing.
Bat Queen says: "Remove bees nest."
Luz climbs a tree, empty staff in hand. A giant buzzing bees nest is sitting in one of the branches. She raises the staff to smack the nest, but it turns into the head of a giant bee that screeches at her.
She falls out of the tree. Cut to her running past Willow and Gus, screaming, the bee screeching after her.
Gus says: "Come on."
Gus says: "Almost got it."
Gus says: "I am free!"
She traps him again, this time suspended from the ceiling.
Gus says: "Aaah."
A second flame goes out.
Bat Queen says: "Give babies a bath!"
Cut to Luz scrubbing one baby bat, sitting on another, a third biting her shoulder. They're all covered in suds.
Willow says: "Go, Luz."
Gus says: "Luz, we're here if you need us."
Willow says: "Yeah."
Willow says: "Cut us free."
Willow says: "We can get Eda."
Luz says: "and I hurt Owlbert."
Luz says: "I need to do this alone so he knows I care about him."
Luz says: "Aw!"
Cut to the Slayground, where Eda is eating a swing.
King says: "No, no!"
King says: "Bad Eda!"
King says: "You are my beast and I control you."
King says: "Hey!"
King says: "..."
King says: "genius!"
King says: "Great."
King says: "Now, change back to Eda."
King says: "Anytime now."
King says: "Just magically transform."
King says: "Ah, nuts."
Eda shreds King's cardboard box armor seconds after he ducks out of it. He runs down the rope net.
King says: "Whoa!"
A siren wails. Cut to a van reading "ANIMAL CONTROL". The demon hunters step out of it, now wearing reflective vests. Demon Hunter #1 steps off the van.
Demon Hunter #2 says: "Uh, this is so embarrassing."
Demon Hunter #1 says: "Hey, hey."
Demon Hunter #1 says: "This job is all we have right now."
Demon Hunter #1 says: "So, I wanna see happy faces."
Demon Hunter #1 says: "Okay?"
Demon Hunter #1 says: "Let's roll out."
King says: "Ah!"
King says: "Animal control."
Demon Hunter #1 says: "Matches the description the parents called in."
Demon Hunter #1 says: "Bag it."
King says: "Oh, no!"
King says: "No, no, no!"
The demon hunters combine spells to create a large green net. Eda tries to jump out of it.
The net shrinks to fit Eda. Demon Hunter #1 shocks her.
Eda falls to the ground. Demon Hunter #1 lifts her away.
King says: "Eda!"
Eda is put into the animal control van. The doors close behind her. King tries to free himself from the rope net.
King says: "Whoa!"
King says: "Awesome."
King says: "Fantastic."
Cut back to Bat Queen's nest. The third flame goes out. Gus frees himself from the web again, landing in a handstand.
Gus says: "Yes, I am free again."
Webs encase him yet again. He screams, muffled, and waves his legs.
Luz says: "Okay, Bat Queen."
Luz says: "That's the last one."
Luz says: "I've done all your chores."
Luz says: "And I've proved my dedication to Owlbert."
Luz says: "I'm so sorry for the pain I caused you, Owlbert."
Luz says: "I promise to be more careful."
Luz says: "Will you come back home with me?"
Owlbert nods and hoots. He flies off of Bat Queen's perch to the ground. Bat Queen raises her claw, and webs encase Owlbert.
Bat Queen says: "No!"
Bat Queen says: "More trails."
Bat Queen says: "Last trial."
Bat Queen says: "You must face..."
Bat Queen says: "me."
She expands her wings, a jet of flames going up behind her.
Luz says: "What?"
Bat Queen says: "You will never get him back!"
Willow says: "Luz, get us out."
Willow says: "We can help."
Luz frees Willow. Willow frees Gus.
Willow says: "Look out!"
Gus says: "I'll hold'em off with my flags."
Gus says: "No!"
Gus says: "That was a bad plan."
Cut to Luz sneaking off.
Bat Queen chases Luz through the forest. Owlbert squawks as he frees a wing from the web. Cut to Luz running.
Luz says: "I won't let you imprison Owlbert."
Bat Queen flies down to attack Luz. She stops her claws with the staff.
Luz says: "Bat Queen, you used to be on a staff, didn't you?"
Luz says: "You were a Palisman."
Cut to the Slayground, where King is still stuck in the net.
King says: "Nyeh!"
King says: "Oof."
Usurper says: "Your pride has destroyed you."
Usurper says: "The throne belongs to me now."
King says: "Over my dead body."
King says: "Eda!"
Usurper says: "Yes, leave and forfeit your reign."
King says: "Well, then, forfeit I shall."
King says: "Huh?"
The animal control van is stuck at a snail road crossing. A giant snail with windows in its shell is slowly making its way across.
King runs to the animal control van. He hefts himself into the back through a window.
King says: "You in there, Eda?"
King says: "Eda, I'm sorry."
King says: "I used you for your strength 'cause I felt weak."
King says: "I'm your friend."
King says: "If only there were some way to remind you who I am."
King says: "Wait a sec."
King says: "Eda loves my rage squeal."
King says: "Like this..."
King says: "Eda, you're back."
Eda says: "What happened?"
King says: "Okay, so I went to your room and you were the beast."
King says: "And then..."
King says: "And then I woke up here one second before you did."
Eda says: "Uh‐huh."
Eda says: "I'll deal with you later."
Eda says: "But for now, you wanna bounce?"
King says: "Yes, please."
Eda explodes the back of the van.
Demon Hunter #1 says: "Aah!"
Demon Hunter #1 says: "Where did it go?"
Demon Hunter #1 says: "Hey, lady."
Demon Hunter #1 says: "H‐Have you seen a monster that kinda looks like you?"
Demon Hunter #1 says: "Lady!"
Eda walks off with King under her arm. Cut to the forest.
Luz says: "You were once a Palisman, weren't you?"
Bat Queen looks at her claw with the interlock on it. She turns away from Luz.
Bat Queen says: "Yes, I was once part of a grand staff."
Bat Queen says: "A staff made for a giant."
Bat Queen says: "But I was broken, discarded."
Luz says: "So, that's why you're so protective of Owlbert."
Bat Queen says: "I protect..."
Bat Queen says: "all!"
Her eyes glow again. Behind her, dozens of other eyes begin glowing.
Countless broken and scarred palismen of every type are in the trees.
Bat Queen says: "I made home in forest."
Bat Queen says: "I'm here to take the lost."
Bat Queen says: "The forgotten."
Luz says: "I understand."
Luz says: "But Owlbert is not forgotten."
Luz says: "He has someone at home who loves him very much."
Bat Queen says: "He will not go back with you."
Luz says: "That's not your decision to make."
Bat Queen says: "I won't let him."
His eyes glow. A second later, so do Bat Queen's.
Bat Queen says: "You..."
Bat Queen says: "You care for her."
Bat Queen says: "Very well."
Bat Queen says: "Go."
Bat Queen says: "And take your friends."
Willow and Gus, still being attacked by the bat babies, run in.
Gus says: "I don't think I'll ever be clean again."
Owlbert grabs Eda's staff and brings it to Luz. Gus wipes the bat babies' spit off of him.
Luz says: "Bat Queen, do you know what happened to your owner?"
Bat Queen says: "It has been thousands of years."
Bat Queen says: "I've forgotten."
Luz says: "If you ever want to search for the truth, I'll help you."
Bat Queen says: "Thank you."
Willow says: "I can't believe you took on the Bat Queen."
Gus says: "And we're not dead."
Luz says: "Thank you for helping me get Owlbert back."
Luz says: "I'm sorry we missed the game."
Gus says: "Are you kidding?"
Gus says: "That was better than any grudgby match."
Gus says: "There were action‐packed trials."
Gus says: "I got to do my flag wave, and I'm slightly traumatized."
Gus says: "Hooray!"
Luz says: "Let's get this little guy home."
Cut to the Owl House, where Luz is putting a bandage on Owlbert's cracked head.
Luz says: "And now you're a part of the boo‐boo buddy club."
Eda says: "Owlbert, why are you off the staff?"
Eda says: "Luz took you to get ice cream?"
Eda says: "Aw, that's..."
Eda says: "a horrible lie."
Eda says: "Well, lucky for you both I don't care right now."
Eda says: "I'm going to take a nap."
King says: "I'll, uh, be at the playground."
Owlbert flies back to Luz's shoulder.
Luz says: "We'll keep this one to ourselves, shall we?"
Cut to Eda's room, where four empty elixir bottles are sitting on her side table.
Eda says: "When did I swallow a swing?"
Cut to Bat Queen's nest, where she is chasing her kids.
Bat Queen says: "Babies."
Bat Queen says: "To bed."
Bat Queen says: "And now it's time to have book before sleeping."
She takes a book out of her mouth. Instead of reading it, she rips off pages and feeds them to her kids.
Bat Queen says: "Yes, consume."
Bat Queen says: "Grow wise."
Bat Queen says: "Avoid paper cuts."
The babies fall asleep. Bat Queen sits on the branch behind them. It's revealed that they are upside down.
