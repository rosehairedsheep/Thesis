Open on King and Luz standing in the living room of the Owl House in front of an easel with a box of crayons on it.
King says: "How do you draw so good, Luz?"
Luz says: "I'm glad you asked that question, King."
Luz says: "Drawing can be fun once you know a few tricks."
Luz says: "He's just a circle and a tube."
King says: "So realistic."
Hooty says: "Hey!"
Hooty says: "What are you guys up to?"
Camera switches between Hooty, shocked, and Luz's drawing of him.
Luz says: "Hooty?"
King says: "Hooty, no."
King says: "It's just a drawing."
Hooty says: "Who are you?"
Hooty says: "This is my territory!"
Hooty says: "Ah!"
Luz says: "Hooty, stop!"
Cut to Hooty "sitting" on the couch, next to drawings of Luz and King.
Hooty says: "Thanks for calming me down back there, guys."
Hooty says: "I can get a little territorial."
Cut to King and Luz peeking at him from around a doorframe.
King says: "Hooty's been talking to those drawings of us for, like, seven hours."
Luz says: "That's the magic of drawing with good proportions."
Luz says: "It makes things look real."
Hooty says: "Wait a minute."
Hooty says: "Who are you?"
Hooty says: "I'm freaking out!"
King and Luz slowly retreat behind the doorframe and out of view.
