Jake says: "Hey, brother."
Jake says: "Pass me that jam, won't you?"
Finn says: "Sure."
Jake says: "Thanks."
Sniffling.
Finn says: "So, how is your toast?"
Jake says: "Pretty good."
Jake says: "Funny, though, I can kind of taste the toast's emotions or something."
Jake says: "Getting ground into flour and then made into bread really did a number on this wheat's sense of self."
Whimpering.
Finn says: "That's a pretty hyper‐developed sense of taste you've got there."
Finn says: "Hey, you seem kind of different."
Jake says: "Nope."
Jake says: "Same old Jake."
Finn says: "You're blue, you've got those five eyes, you're way bigger, and you keep discovering strange new abilities."
Finn says: "I think this might be a situation."
Jake sporadically grows wings.
Jake says: "Whoops!"
Jake says: "Tuck‐tuck."
Jake says: "See?"
Jake says: "Same old Jake."
BMO says: "Ahhh!"
Jake says: "Whoa."
BMO says: "Ahhh!"
BMO says: "Jake is a crab!"
BMO says: "Ahhh!"
Finn says: "Same old Jake."
Finn says: "If you say so."
Jake says: "Hmm."
Jake, Lady Rainicorn, and Dirt Beer Guy are at the the latter's tavern.
Jake says: "I think I'm handling these minor changes pretty well."
Jake says: "Besides, a lot of people are different these days."
Jake says: "Dirt Beer Guy, you're practically a zombie."
Jake says: "How are you dealing with it?"
Dirt Beer Guy says: "Well, I'm basically the same as before."
Dirt Beer Guy says: "The difference is only physical."
Jake says: "So you agree Finn is really overreacting?"
Dirt Beer Guy says: "Totally."
Dirt Beer Guy says: "You're the same person as before."
Jake says: "Heck yeah!"
Jake says: "I'm still the same old Jake on the inside."
Dirt Beer Guy says: "Wait, you're Jake?!"
Dirt Beer Guy says: "!"
Dirt Beer Guy says: "Uh, pardon me."
Dirt Beer Guy says: "Oh, dear, oh, dear."
Dirt Beer Guy says: "That's really something."
Jake says: "You know, I think I figured out why I make people uneasy."
Jake says: "They're used to yellow Jake."
Jake says: "Lady, that tickles."
Jake says: "It's okay, lady."
Jake says: "Thanks for trying, but I'm fine, really."
Jake says: "I love me, too."
Jake barks in his sleep. We cut to his dream, where he follows distant music through a maze. Many identical women are worshipping a statue of Warren Ampersand. The statue comes to life, and turns Jake blue. He wakes up, tied to a stone tablet, and then screams.
Now at Jermaine's house, but still in a dream.
Jake says: "Jermaine?"
Jermaine says: "Ahh, mountain colors."
Jermaine says: "I'm painting this mountain."
Jermaine says: "I think it's really coming together."
JakeThat's the mountain?
Jermaine says: "Yep."
Jermaine says: "I'm a mirror."
Jermaine says: "Hey, who's your friend?"
Jake says: "Yipe!"
Warren turns into Joshua.
Jake says: "Dad?"
Joshua says: "Look at this."
Joshua says: "I can almost walk the dog."
Jermaine says: "Your body looks like one of my paintings."
Jermaine says: "Pretty weird dream, huh?"
Jake says: "This isn't just a dream body, this is what my body looks like when I'm awake."
Jermaine says: "Oh."
Jermaine says: "Got it."
Jermaine says: "Ha!"
Jermaine says: "I've got it!"
Jake says: "What?"
Joshua says: "I can almost walk the dog."
Jake says: "Finn, you up?"
Finn says: "Yeah, man."
Jake says: "I had a really bad dream last night."
Jake says: "So ominous."
Jake says: "These images are going to haunt me for, like, forever."
Finn says: "Sometimes it helps me if I draw a bad dream in picture form."
Finn says: "My crayons!"
Jake says: "It was a weird scene, all right."
Jake says: "Chanting ladies, labyrinths, classical sculpture."
Jake says: "And Jermaine was there, too."
Jake says: "The weird thing was that he was painting abstract art."
Finn says: "So?"
Finn says: "F."
Finn says: "Y."
Finn says: "I."
Finn says: ", Jermaine hates abstract art."
Finn says: "He would never paint something non‐representational."
Finn says: "Maybe he's just trying something new?"
Jake says: "It's not in his nature."
Jake says: "Why would he all of a sudden get into painting meaningless shapes?"
Finn says: "He's probably fine."
Jake says: "Just feels so out of character, you know, for Jermaine."
Finn says: "How's the drawing?"
Jake says: "Just squiggles."
Later.
Finn says: "Fuelish tank!"
Finn says: "You are too slow for the Finnosaurus."
Finn says: "Give up!"
Finn says: "Give up!"
Jake says: "I knew I had seen that mountain."
James says: "Vrrt‐vrrt‐vrrt!"
James says: "Brrt!"
James says: "Who goes there?!"
James says: "!"
Jake says: "James, it's me, Jake."
James says: "You look nothing like Jake, but I believe you."
James says: "I just have to ask because I'm supposed to guard the Wasteland."
James says: "I was just making some beans."
James says: "Come to my tent!"
Jake says: "Okay, but I don't want any beans."
James says: "Man!"
James says: "I could eat beans all day, every day."
Jake says: "Where did you get that painting?"
James says: "One day when I was guarding, I saw Jermaine painting it."
James says: "James was like, "Dang, I like that painting!"
James says: "" And he was like,"You can have it."
James says: "" And I was like, "Waah?"
Jake says: "You like this?"
Jake says: "It doesn't look anything like a mountain."
James says: "I think you're looking at it wrong."
Jake says: "Where'd Jermaine go..."
Jake says: "after?"
James says: "He went back to his studio, behind the wall of water."
Jake says: "You mean a waterfall?"
James says: "No, like the thing I said."
Wall of Water says: "Hey!"
Wall of Water says: "None but the chosen may walk beyond the wall of water."
Jake says: "What have you done with my brother?"
Wall of Water says: "Who's your brother?"
Jake says: "Jermaine."
Wall of Water says: "Wow."
Wall of Water says: "You guys don't look anything alike."
Jake says: "We're practically twins."
Wall of Water says: "Well, I guess you can walk beyond the wall of water."
Wall of Water says: "But just this once."
Wall of Water says: "Ooooh!"
Bryce says: "Can I help you, sir?"
Jake says: "Hey, Bryce."
Jake says: "I'm looking for Jermaine."
Jake says: "Is he behind that door marked "private"?"
Bryce says: "No, no, no."
Bryce says: "Mr."
Bryce says: "Jermaine won't be seeing anyone today."
Bryce says: "His wishes for privacy were quite explicit."
Bryce says: "You wouldn't want to interrupt Mr."
Bryce says: "Jermaine."
Bryce says: "He's a brilliant painter."
Jake says: "Yeah, he used to be."
Jake says: "Now you got him painting all this nonsense."
Bryce says: "I'm just his humble dealer."
Bryce says: "So many times I've watched him painting, painting, painting."
Jake says: "What's really going on, Bryce?"
Jake says: "My dad told me all about your demon tricks."
Bryce says: "Well, now I don't want to say anything bad about your dad, but..."
Jake beats Bryce up offscreen, and covers his mouth in a backpack.
Jake says: "Bro?"
Jake says: "I'm here to save you."
Jermaine says: "Hmm?"
Jermaine says: "Oh, hey."
Jermaine says: "I'm not sure if this is done yet."
Jermaine says: "It's hard to tell when an abstract is finished."
Jake says: "Jermaine, what's wrong with you?"
Jake says: "Who's taken away your identity as a landscape painter?"
Jake says: "No, I just look different."
Jermaine says: "Eh, that sounds like denial."
Jake says: "No, it doesn't!"
Jermaine says: "Come on, bro."
Nothing's different! I'm the same! Same old Jake! Completely...normal! he morphs into a dragon-like shape.
Jake says: "This looks bad, but deep down,I'm not different."
Jake says: "And you're not different either, right?"
Jake says: "You'll go back to painting landscapes?"
Jermaine says: "No one is making me do this."
Jermaine says: "I painted so many landscapes that the shapes of the land began to lose their meaning."
Jermaine says: "And the shapes broke apart to me, so I painted them like that."
Jermaine says: "And it's not like my new paintings erase my old paintings."
Jermaine says: "They're both me."
Jermaine says: "Okay."
Jermaine says: "I think I'm starting to get it."
Jermaine says: "I like the new look, by the way."
Jake says: "'Cause you like your brothers to be crazy shapes?"
Jermaine says: "Sure."
Jermaine says: "Also, Dad told me you might go through some changes one day."
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jermaine says: "He told me to be supportive."
Jermaine says: "But I would've done that anyway."
Jake says: "I wonder what he meant."
Jermaine says: "You knowhow secretive Dad was."
Jermaine says: "Sorry I don't have more answers."
Jake says: "Well, do you have any more of these paintings?"
Jermaine smiles, and then Jake watches as the paintings float around him in his imagination.
Jake says: "The shapes are always changing."
Jake says: "Changing is their normal state, like us."
Jake says: "Even if we're not changing on the outside, we're changing on the inside constantly."
Jake says: "There's some stuff about me that I've been ignoring for a long time."
Jake says: "I'm afraid of that stuff."
Jake says: "But it's part of who I am."
Jake says: "As long as I know the shape of my soul, I'll be alright."
Jermaine says: "Wow."
Jermaine says: "You really understand my art."
Jake says: "Oh, I totally don't understand anything."
Both laugh.
Jake enters the Tree House.
Finn says: "Hey, you're back."
Jake says: "Yeah, I went to see Jermaine."
Jake says: "He says hi."
Finn says: "No, I mean, like,you're really back."
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake goes to the mirror, and sees that he's yellow again.
Jake says: "Different, yet the same."
