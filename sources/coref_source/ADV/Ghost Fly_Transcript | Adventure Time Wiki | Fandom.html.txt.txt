A thunderstorm rages outside the Tree Fort. Inside, BMO is practicing karate.
BMO says: "Kya!"
BMO says: "Kya!"
BMO says: "Hmm."
[The magazine reads says: "1."
"How to stop a man's heart with karate says: "1."
[The magazine reads says: "'Focus chi' and 2."
"How to stop a man's heart with karate says: "'Focus chi' and 2."
[The magazine reads says: "'Stop a man's heart'" with diagrams depicting each action."
"How to stop a man's heart with karate says: "'Stop a man's heart'" with diagrams depicting each action."
BMO says: "Ohhh, that's pretty good."
BMO says: "Kya!"
Jake says: "BMO..."
Jake says: "keep it down!"
BMO says: "But you said 8:00 to 10:00 is my time to do karate."
BMO says: "It's my karate time!"
Jake says: "I know, but I got a headache, and I'm in a funky mood."
Finn says: "What's wrong, dude?"
Jake says: "I don't know."
Jake says: "I think I got restless leg syndrome."
Finn says: "Is that from getting chubby?"
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "No, man, it's just restless leg."
Finn says: "Oop!"
Finn says: "My bad."
Jake says: "What are you reading?"
Finn says: "This old copy of Adventure Boy magazine—"
Finn says: "the only magazine for boy adventurers."
Finn says: "This kid Rusty is getting chased down the river by three grown otters."
Finn says: "This magazine rules!"
Finn says: "But I'm saving the end for tomorrow."
Jake says: "Cool."
Finn says: "Well, I hope your leg feels better."
Finn says: "I'm turning in."
Finn says: "I'll see you up there."
BMO says: "Jake..."
Jake says: "No, BMO."
BMO says: "KYA!"
Jake says: "Maybe some soup will take the edge off."
Jake starts preparing a pot of soup. A fly lands on the edge and slurps it.
Jake says: "Ew!"
Jake says: "Gross!"
Jake says: "Nasty!"
Jake says: "Hyah!"
The fly flails its legs a little, then stops moving.
Jake says: "I'm sorry you were born a fly and I had to kill you, you disgusting, disgusting creature."
BMO says: "Kya!"
BMO says: "Kya!"
BMO says: "Kya!"
Jake says: "BMO, PLEASE!"
Outside, the rain has stopped. Jake climbs upstairs and into his bed.
Suddenly, some rattling and knocking sounds are heard coming from downstairs.
Jake says: "Finn, was that you?"
Jake says: "Probably just BMO or something."
The record downstairs is heard playing jazz.
Jake says: "That's weird."
Jake says: "BMO doesn't like 30's jazz."
On a shelf above Jake, a toy monkey starts clacking its cymbals together repeatedly.
Jake says: "I didn't know we had one of those."
Voice says: "Oooooo..."
Jake says: "Hey, hey."
Jake says: "Hey, who?"
A ghost fly appears and slowly moves toward Jake.
Jake says: "Aah!"
Ghost Fly says: "Ooooooo..."
Jake says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "I killed you!"
The fly swoops at Jake and buzzes around his head.
Jake says: "Aah!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
The fly continues buzzing around Jake.
Finn says: "Aah!"
Jake says: "Ghost fly, man!"
Jake says: "Aah!"
Jake says: "Aah!"
Finn says: "Okay."
Jake says: "Come on, man."
Jake says: "Let's get out of the house."
Jake says: "It's a ghost fly!"
Finn says: "So what?"
Jake says: "No, man, ghost flies are filthy!"
Jake says: "They carry diseases, such as tuberculosis, polio, dysentery."
Jake says: "They leave those little fly doodies on your soul."
The ghost fly swoops in and out of Jake's torso.
Jake says: "Aah!"
The ghost fly conjures a scythe out of nowhere and chases after Finn and Jake. They dodge its attack and jump downstairs.
BMO says: "Finn, Jake!"
BMO says: "What's wrong?!"
BMO says: "!"
Finn says: "Ghost fly!"
Jake says: "Ghost fly!"
The three run out of the tree fort. They stop after a few seconds.
Jake says: "Thank goodness we lost him."
Jake says: "He's gone."
Suddenly, the ghost fly appears beside him.
Ghost Fly says: "Whoo."
BMO says: "Run!"
BMO says: "Just run!"
Jake and BMO bump into Finn.
Finn says: "Ay-ay-ay-ay!"
They all run back into the Tree Fort, with the ghost fly follows closely. BMO stops and turns around to face it.
BMO says: "Hmm."
BMO says: "Kya!"
BMO says: "Kya!"
The ghost fly telepathically levitates BMO and throws it against the wall.
Jake says: "We should ask what its unfinished business is."
Jake says: "Ghosts always have unfinished business."
Finn says: "Ghost fly, what's your problem?!"
Finn says: "!"
The ghost fly swipes its scythe at him.
Finn says: "Come on, dude."
Finn says: "Tell us your unfinished business!"
The ghost fly swipes two more times.
Finn says: "Aah!"
Finn says: "It's no good."
Finn says: "He's a tortured little spirit."
Finn says: "We need help to communicate with this ghost fly."
Jake says: "Nah, man, let's just get someone to banish it—"
Jake says: "someone with serious paranormal juice."
The scene cuts to a silhouette sitting at a table. His phone rings twice; he silences it. The silhouette, wearing a hat and carrying a bag, approaches the Tree Fort. Back inside, Finn, Jake, and BMO are hiding inside a suit of armor.
BMO says: "Is he coming soon?"
Jake says: "I think so."
Jake says: "His ways are kind of mysterious."
Finn says: "That's cool."
The ghost fly flies into the suit of armor.
Finn throws off the top half of the armor and runs. Clattering and shouting are heard offscreen as the mysterious person enters the Tree Fort. Finn, Jake, and BMO are hiding behind a table barricade while the fly swipes at them. On hearing the person enter, the fly turns toward him.
Ghost Fly says: "Woo?"
Peppermint Butler says: "Let's get this ritual rolling."
Peppermint Butler says: "I got stuff to do."
Ghost Fly says: "Woo!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Hey!"
Peppermint Butler says: "No!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Unclean demon, feel the sting of holy water!"
The ghost fly dodges it and flies into a hole in the wall.
Jake says: "Thank you."
Peppermint Butler says: "we..."
Peppermint Butler says: "have..."
The ghost fly takes the bag into the hole in the wall. Peppermint Butler puts his hat on, jumps out the window, and runs away. The ghost fly comes out and flies toward Jake but is stopped by the circle.
Jake says: "Well, huh."
Jake says: "How about that?"
Jake says: "No biggie."
Jake says: "We'll just hang out inside these magic circles until morning."
Jake says: "That's when ghosts go to sleep."
Jake says: "Yep."
Jake says: "Just got to make it..."
Jake says: "till morning."
The ghost fly buzzes in circles around them while wailing spookily. A time lapse shows storm clouding rolling past the Tree Fort. Eventually, the ghost fly stops.
Ghost Fly says: "Woo!"
Finn hears the sound of papers rustling.
Finn says: "Hmm?"
On the table, the magazine he was reading flips to the page he was on and turns toward him.
Finn says: "The end of my story."
Finn says: "And it's so close."
Jake says: "Don't do it, bro."
Jake says: "It's a trap."
Finn says: "I know."
Finn says: "It's an obvi trap."
Finn says: "But wait."
Finn says: "What if..."
Finn says: "watch this."
Finn says: "Ha!"
Finn says: "Mm?"
Jake says: "Dude, what are you—"
Jake says: "?"
Finn says: "If I extend the circle..."
Finn says: "farther..."
Finn says: "I can get closer to the magazine."
BMO says: "Theoretically, that is possible."
Jake says: "Yeah, but I'm still getting a "woo-jah" feeling."
Jake says: "This seems like a bad idea."
Finn says: "Just have to stay inside this circle."
From an aerial view, the "circle" is evidently an outline of a woman.
Finn says: "Ha ha!"
Finn says: "How'd you do it, Rusty?"
Finn says: "How'd you shake them otters?"
Jake says: "Finn?"
Jake says: "What's wrong, buddy?"
Jake says: "Oh, Finn, you're disgusting!"
Finn crouches and grunts as he sprouts two wings. He flies up to the ceiling and spits on the floor near Jake and BMO.
Jake says: "Aw, that's it!"
Jake says: "I've had it with this ghost fly!"
Jake says: "I wish I were a ghost so I could punch him with my ghost fist!"
BMO says: "Jake, I have a radical option."
BMO says: "I've been studying a karate move that could temporarily stop your heart long enough for you to fight the ghost on his own plane of existence."
Jake says: "What?"
BMO says: "It's okay!"
BMO says: "I learned it out of a magazine."
Jake says: "All right."
Jake says: "But first you got to give me some unfinished business so I can come back as a ghost."
BMO says: "Tell me a joke."
Jake says: "Okay."
Jake says: "What do you call a bear that only attacks guys named Paul?"
BMO says: "Kya!"
BMO says: "I killed Jake!"
BMO says: "Yay, BMO!"
Ghost Jake says: "Whoa!"
Ghost Jake says: "BMO, you killed me."
Ghost Jake says: "Whoa."
Ghost Jake says: "Wow."
Ghost Jake says: "Wow!"
BMO says: "Jake!"
BMO says: "I can't hear you!"
BMO says: "I will start your heart up in five minutes, okay?"
BMO says: "This many!"
Jake says: "Okay."
Jake says: "Five minutes."
Jake says: "Whoa."
Several spirits of insects, animals, and furniture are seen.
Jake says: "Is this some kind of low-level dead world?"
Jake says: "That's a bummer."
Finn's body suddenly drops onto Jake's.
Jake says: "Aah!"
The ghost fly flies toward him and gashes his arm.
Jake says: "Aah!"
Jake says: "Oh, stuff!"
Jake says: "Aah!"
The ghost fly starts chasing Ghost Jake.
Jake says: "Ohh!"
Jake says: "Ohh!"
Jake says: "Get away!"
The ghost fly cuts it in half, causing it to disappear.
Jake says: "Aah!"
Jake says: "You killed it!"
Jake says: "Aah!"
The ghost fly cuts a ghost table in half and continues chasing Jake.
Jake says: "Aah!"
Jake says: "Aah!"
Jake says: "Get away!"
Jake continues throwing ghosts at the ghost fly, who slices each in half with his scythe. The ghost fly then catches up with Jake and slices his lower back.
Floating into the kitchen, Jake trips over a cat and bumps the stove, knocking the pot of soup onto the floor. The ghost fly charges toward Jake.
Just then, the ghost of the soup appears beside Jake.
Ghost Soup says: "Oooooo..."
Ghost Fly says: "Hmm?"
Ghost Soup says: "Hoooooo!"
The ghost fly starts slurping the ghost soup.
Jake says: "That's right."
Jake says: "You never finished the soup."
Jake says: "That's your unfinished business!"
Ghost Fly says: "Woo-woo."
Jake says: "And now that you've finished it, you get to ascend to a glorious, new peaceful realm."
The ghost fly nods and starts shining and ascending slowly.
Jake says: "What's happening?"
Jake says: "Oh, BMO must be bringing me back!"
Jake says: "Yes!"
Jake says: "Yeah, BMO!"
Jake wakes up in a hospital bed.
Jake says: "Mm."
Jake says: "BMO?"
Finn and BMO run to Jake and embrace him.
Finn says: "Jake, I missed you, bro!"
BMO says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Don't ever leave me again!"
Jake says: "Good job, BMO!"
Jake says: "You brought me back."
BMO says: "Yes."
BMO says: "Yay, BMO."
BMO says: "BMO is so good."
Doctor Princess and Nurse Pound Cake are standing by with a defibrillator, having just used it on Jake.
Doctor Princess says: "Whew!"
Episode ends.
