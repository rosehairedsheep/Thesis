The episode begins with Finn falling headfirst from a great height with Jake in his pack.
Jake says: "You gonna do the thing again?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Yeah, man!"
With that, Jake turns into a ripcord and Finn tugs him; Jake uses his powers to turn into the canopy of a parachute. They both fall gently towards the surface, and Jake throws Finn when they are low enough to do so safely. Finn lands on the ground rolling and does some acrobatics eventually landing in front of Princess Bubblegum; he snaps twice, wiggles his fingers, and claps once.
Finn says: "Whaaaat?"
Jake says: "Nice."
Finn says: "Hey, Princess Bubblegum."
Finn says: "Hey, everybody."
Crowd of Candy People cheers, and everyone starts partying. A bear notices the party. Finn and Jake sit down to rest from dancing.
Jake says: "Dancin' is rough!"
Finn says: "Yeah..."
Finn says: "I'm havin' some sweat issues here!"
Finn says: "I'll go get us some snackety-juice."
The bear arrives at Finn's and Jake's table.
Jake says: "Hey, man."
Jake says: "I'm Jake."
Jake says: "Hmmmm..."
Finn says: "Check it out, Jake!"
Finn says: "I got us some peanuts."
Finn says: "And punch!"
The bear attempts to imitate Finn; Finn laughs. Finn eats a peanut, and the bear responds by eating three peanuts, but it starts choking.
Finn says: "Choking!!"
Finn says: "Don't give up on me, man!"
Everyone gasps. Finn quickly takes out the Enchiridion and slaps it on the bear's back, making him regurgitate the peanuts. Everyone cheers.
Candy Person #24 says: "Whoa, Finn, nice book."
Finn says: "Haha."
Finn says: "He's all good!"
Finn says: "Everybody get back to your dancin'!"
The Candy People cheer and resume dancing.
The scene changes to nighttime; Finn and Jake are walking home.
Jake says: "Uh, Finn?"
Jake says: "I think that bear is followin' us home."
Finn says: "Whoa."
Finn says: "Haha."
Finn says: "I think you're right."
Finn says: "Hey, bear, you gonna come hang out with us?"
Finn says: "Heh-heh."
Finn says: "Awesome."
Jake says: "I dunno, Finn."
Jake says: "This guy seems kinda weird."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "He's totally weird."
Finn says: "Hahaha!"
Jake says: "Mmmmm..."
Scene changes to inside of the Tree Fort. Jake is listening to music.
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Hey, Jake!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Come here!"
Finn says: "Ya gotta check this out!"
Jake says: "Eh, okay."
Finn says: "Check this out, man."
Finn says: "This bear is tops blooby!"
Finn says: "Ya gotta try this, Jake."
Finn says: "He does everything I do!"
Finn grabs a drink and sucks on the straw. The bear looks for something to imitate with and chews on BMO's leg in resolution.
Finn says: "Haha, come on, Jake, try it!"
BMO says: "It's awesome!"
Jake says: "Heh-heh."
Jake says: "Um..."
Jake says: "Yeah, okay."
Jake says: "Sweepy-sweepy-sweepy."
Jake says: "Sweep sweep sweep."
Jake says: "Sweepin'!"
The bear hits Jake and knocks him to the ground.
Finn says: "He's got me down pat!"
Finn says: "Heh-hah!"
Finn says: "Sweeping's weak."
Jake says: "Mmmmmm..."
Bear says: "Sweeping weak."
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "This guy's alright!"
Jake says: "This guy just busted me up my chops, Finn!"
Finn says: "Hey, come on, he's just a bear."
Finn says: "He don't know nothin'."
Jake says: "Mmmm..."
Jake says: "Yeah, I guess."
Jake says: "Well, anyway, it's gettin' pretty late."
Jake says: "Probably time for everyone to go back home to their own houses."
Finn says: "Yeah, I guess you're right, Jake."
Finn says: "It is pretty late."
Finn says: "He should probably stay here tonight."
Finn says: "You can sleep in the bathtub!"
Bear says: "Braaaathtub."
Finn says: "Brathtub, hahaha!"
Finn says: "This guy's tops blooby!"
Scene switches to the bedroom; Jake and Finn are asleep. Jake's woken up by sounds coming from downstairs and goes to investigate. He finds the bear dressed up in Finn's clothes and snapping like Finn did earlier.
Bear says: "Whaaaat?"
Bear says: "Hey!"
Jake goes back upstairs to the bedroom and bites Finn's arm.
Finn says: "What are you doing?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Shhh."
Jake says: "Come with me."
Jake says: "Ya gotta see somethin'."
Jake says: "This bear's wiggy, Finn."
Jake says: "It's wearing your clothes and dancin' around all crazy."
Finn says: "That sounds rad, man."
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "No—"
Jake says: "Just—"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "Rrrr!"
Cut to the bear sleeping downstairs.
Jake says: "Aw, man!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "I do believe you."
Jake says: "Oh."
Finn says: "It's just, y'know, who cares?"
Finn says: "Dancing, wearing clothes..."
Finn says: "He ain't hurtin' nobody."
Finn says: "He's just doin' it up, y'know?"
Finn says: "He's just cool, and he likes my style."
Finn says: "That ain't a crime."
Jake says: "No."
Jake says: "I guess not."
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "Great."
Finn says: "I'm going back to bed."
Finn says: "You comin', smart guy?"
Jake says: "Yeah, okay."
They both go back to bed; Jake looks back at the bear for a moment.
Scene shifts to the next morning. Everyone is having breakfast; Jake leers at the bear who is still wearing Finn's clothes and Finn. Everything Finn does, the bear does the same, more perfectly this time.
Jake says: "You're not even a little weirded out by this?"
Finn says: ": No, man."
Bear says: ": No, man."
Finn says: "He's just doin' his instincts."
Bear says: "He's just doin' his instincts."
Finn says: "He's like a parrot or chameleon or something."
Bear says: "He's like a parrot or chameleon or something."
Finn says: "He's funny!"
Bear says: "He's funny!"
Jake makes an incredibly annoyed face.
Finn says: "Anyway, I gotta go pick up BMO from soccer."
Finn says: "I'll be back soon."
Finn says: "And remember: don't eat my special Finn Cakes."
Finn says: "Finn only."
Jake says: "Yeah, I get it."
Jake says: "You don't need to tell me that every time you make Finn Cakes."
Finn points at Jake, implying that he's watching him, and walks out. Jake scoffs. The bear goes towards the Finn Cakes.
Jake says: "Hey, what are you doin'?!"
Jake says: "!"
Time skip.
Jake hums.
Finn says: "OH, MY GLOB, WHAT?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "JAKE!"
Finn says: "YOU ATE ALL MY FINN CAKES!"
Finn says: "WHAT THE STINK!"
Jake says: "Uh, nope."
Jake says: "The bear did it, and I've got proof."
Jake says: "I taped the whole thing."
Finn says: "The bear ate all my cakes, and you just sat there and watched him do it?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "What's wrong with you?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Ju—"
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "No, man, he was tryin' to frame me, Finn!"
Jake says: "He's tryin' to steal your identity!"
Jake says: "Why can't you grok that?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "He's a bear, Jake!"
Finn says: "He's a wild animal!"
Finn says: "He doesn't know things!"
Finn says: "He just does stuff!"
Finn says: "He's cool!"
Jake says: "Ohh, fine, then that's just great."
Jake says: "Then you and M."
Jake says: "C."
Jake says: "Cool Friend can go stink it up together at your stupid cool Finn party all by yourself, cause I'm not going!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Wait."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "What party?"
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "Your party, man."
Jake says: "Tonight?"
Jake says: "In the woods?"
Finn says: ""Finn'z..."
Finn says: "bezt..."
Finn says: "party?"
Finn says: "" But..."
Finn says: "I didn't make this flyer."
Jake says: "Huh?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Well, who did, then?!"
Jake says: "!"
Beat.
Finn says: "The bear."
Jake says: "The bear."
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "I knew it."
Scene changes to the aforementioned party. The bear dressed like Finn is dancing with the Candy People including Princess Bubblegum.
Jake says: "See, dude?"
Jake says: "He's not just jackin' your style."
Jake says: "He's jackin' your whole you!"
Jake says: "Jackin' yo you up!"
Finn says: "What the what?"
Jake says: "He got in close and used you."
Jake says: "Now he's feedin' nuts to your ex-girlfriend!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "peanut."
Finn says: "She's not my..."
Finn says: "We never went steady."
The bear performs the Heimlich maneuver on Princess Bubblegum, and she spits peanuts out and laughs.
Jake says: "He's trying to replace you, and he's already got everyone convinced he's you!"
Jake says: "He didn't really like you."
Jake says: "He used you."
Finn, angry, marches up to the bear.
Bear says: "Tops blooby!"
Bear says: "Tops blooby."
Bear says: "Tops—"
Finn says: "Not cool, man."
Finn says: "It's okay, everyone."
Finn says: "The imposter is gone."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "nobody really thought the bear was you."
Finn says: "Wait..."
Finn says: "what?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "We just thought it was one of your jokey-joke-jokes."
Jake shrinks in shame in the background. Finn and Jake both run after the bear.
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Hey, bear!"
Jake says: "Wait up, guy!"
Finn says: "Hey."
Finn says: "I..."
Finn says: "I didn't mean to make you feel so bad about yourself."
Finn says: "I'm really sorry about that."
Jake says: "Me, too."
Finn says: "But..."
Finn says: "you're a super-rad bear, so..."
Finn says: "why not just be you?"
Bear says: "I..."
Bear says: "want..."
Bear says: "be..."
Bear says: "hero..."
Bear says: "like..."
Bear says: "yooouuuu!"
Finn says: "Awww..."
Jake says: "I guess he's got a heart of gold after all."
Finn says: "Hold on, bear."
Finn says: "I got something for ya."
Finn says: "It's the Enchiridion, the hero's handbook."
Finn says: "Everything you need to know about being a hero is in this book."
Finn says: "Take it, and learn."
Jake says: "Finn, are you nuts?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "We can't give that book away!"
Jake says: "It's, like, crazy-important!"
Finn says: "Whatever, man."
Finn says: "We never use it, except for, like, sitting on it when the grass is wet and stuff."
Finn says: "Drink your fill of knowledge."
Finn says: "Someday, you'll be a great hero."
Bear says: "Thank you, Finn."
Bear says: "Thank..."
Bear says: "yooouuu..."
The next scene shows the bear travelling far, far away with the book on a bike. Eventually, he reaches a rocky mountain and climbs it with the book in his paw. He arrives at a cave and roars. A voice answers.
Voice says: "Did you bring the book?"
The bear holds up the book. The Snail, still possessed by the Lich, comes out of the shadows.
Snail says: "Yessss..."
Snail says: "One step closer."
The episode ends.
