Lady, Jake, and Finn are walking into an open field with a picnic blanket and basket.
Lady Rainicorn.
Finn and Jake set down the blanket and Jake helps to coil Lady like a snake on top of it.
Finn says: "Ahhh!"
Jake says: "Ahhh!"
Finn says: "Oh!"
Finn says: "Oh, man!"
Finn says: "My throwing and catching disc!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Wanna play throw-n-catch throwing a catching disc?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Ha ha!"
Jake says: "Yeah man!"
Finn says: "Throw-n-catch!"
Jake says: "Throw-n-catch!"
Finn says: "Throw-n-catch!"
Jake says: "Throw-n-catch!"
Jake says: "I call being dog and you be human!"
Finn and Jake both run away from the picnic saying "yeah" and "wooo".
Jake says: "Dog!"
Jake says: "Dog Dog Dog Dog!"
Finn says: "You mean "bark."
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "Oh yeah."
Finn says: "Hello, I am a human."
Finn says: "Hello, I am a human."
They stop near a tree in the field.
Jake says: "Ready!"
Jake says: "Bark!"
Finn says: "Peeeeerfeeeeeeect Throoooooow!"
Jake says: "More like the perfect blow!"
Jake says: "That blew."
Finn says: "Aw, come on!"
Finn says: "That was the wind!"
Finn says: "The wind blows!"
Jake says: "Hey, you want me to grab it?"
Finn says: "Naw, I'll get it!"
Jake says: "Good luck buddy!"
Finn says: "Thanks!"
Finn runs up to the tree and looks up. He tries to grab onto a low branch, but it breaks and he falls a short distance. He immediately gets up and tries again. He walks a short distance around the tree and stops to look up again. He turns around and blows a raspberry. As he covers his eyes, a porcupine crawls out on a higher up branch.
Porcupine says: "Oh, well hello there my friend."
Porcupine says: "What are you doing?"
Finn says: "I'm trying to get to the top of this tree to get my disc."
Porcupine says: "Oh, well maybe I can help!"
Porcupine says: "Sit on me."
Finn says: "Uhhhh, What?"
Porcupine says: "Sit on me, its okedo-its fine, go ahead."
Finn says: "I don't think that kinda thing really works, actually."
Porcupine says: "You can do it if you believe in yourself!"
Porcupine says: "Sit on me."
Porcupine says: "Oooh, alriight, I'll shooow you!"
Porcupine says: "Sorry!"
Porcupine says: "I thought that would work."
Finn says: "Ooch!"
Finn says: "Pooooooped!"
Finn says: "I'm not a chipmunk!"
Finn says: "I'm a human boy!"
Finn says: "I'm trying to climb the tree, I'm trying to get my disc back."
Finn says: "But for now I'm takin' a break, because I am pooooped!"
Squirrel says: "You should eat an apple to reinvigorate your climbing ability."
Finn says: "No thanks, I'm good, just gonna rest my meat hooks."
Squirrel says: "Aw, that apple was cursed or something."
Squirrel says: "I'm sorry, I didn't know."
Squirrel says: "Oh, dear I ruined your day and now you'll never get your disc."
Finn says: "Naw, it's okay."
Finn says: "I've been in worse situations."
Finn says: "And even though I'm tiny, I do feel invigorated."
Squirrel says: "Oh, good!"
Squirrel says: "What a relief!"
Finn says: "Bye!"
Finn says: "Bye!"
Jake says: "Wohoah!"
Jake says: "You're tiny!"
Finn says: "I ate a magic apple by mistake."
Jake says: "Uhh!"
Jake says: "No wonder it's been takin' so long!"
Jake says: "Need any help?"
Finn says: "Nah, I got it."
Jake says: "Okay, well, I'm gonna walk Lady home."
Jake says: "I'll be back later."
Jake says: "Don't eat any more magic apples."
Jake says: "Silly."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "No I won't."
Finn says: "I don't plan to."
Jake says: "Thank you for packing."
Lady Rainicorn says: "천만에."
Jake says: "You should take it easy."
Lady Rainicorn says: "괜찮아."
Jake says: "No, no, let's get you back."
Finn says: "my disc!"
Finn says: "Hey, I'm over here!"
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "I'm over here!"
Finn says: "Have you seen my disc?"
Squirrel says: "Wrap it up good so I don't trip and fall on my face like the last time."
Finn says: "Heeey!"
Finn says: "Woah!"
Owl says: "Squirrel!"
Owl says: "What happened with the apple?"
Squirrel says: "It made him smaller!"
Squirrel says: "I think it mighta been cursed you guys!"
Owl says: "Well a-course it was cursed!"
Owl says: "We're tryin' to stop the human!"
Owl says: "Come on fellas!"
Owl says: "I feel like I'm the only one comin' up with ideas here, Lenny!"
Owl says: "How do you think we should stop the human?"
Lenny the Beaver says: "Uuum… Maybe uh, trapdoor!"
Lenny the Beaver says: "Sometin' like that, with gravity!"
Owl says: "Hey, yeah!"
Owl says: "We could put like a rug over it!"
Finn says: "Uuuh, It's okay, III'm a chipmunk."
All the animals says: "In the tree, part of the tree."
Squirrel says: "Sorry."
All the animals says: "In the tree, part of the tree."
All the animals says: "In the tree, part of the tree."
All the animals says: "In the tree, part of the tree."
Squirrel says: "What?"
Finn says: "Uuuh, I didn't say anything."
Finn says: "What are they gonna do to me?"
Squirrel says: "What?"
Squirrel says: "I'm not allowed to talk to you."
Squirrel says: "Anyone and anything that winds up in the tree becomes part of the tree forever and ever."
Squirrel says: "In the tree, part of the tree."
Finn says: "So does that mean I'm a prisoner forever?"
Squirrel says: "Well yes."
Squirrel says: "And no."
Squirrel says: "Are you a prisoner?"
Squirrel says: "Yes."
Squirrel says: "Will you ever be free?"
Squirrel says: "No."
Squirrel says: "In the tree, part of the tree."
Squirrel says: "It's very simple."
Finn says: "Doesn't that mean that you can't leave the tree either?"
Squirrel says: "No I- Well yes and no."
Squirrel says: "Am I allowed to leave the tree?"
Squirrel says: "No."
Squirrel says: "Have I already left the tree?"
Squirrel says: "Am I miles away from the tree right now flying around like the flying squirrel that I am?"
Squirrel says: "Yes!"
Squirrel says: "In my mind!"
Squirrel says: "In- my- mind!"
Finn says: "Do you like it here?"
Squirrel says: "Yeah!"
Squirrel says: "Well, yes and no."
Squirrel says: "Do I like the nuts and acorns?"
Squirrel says: "Yes."
Squirrel says: "Do I like it when they put me down and say mean things like "You're not a flying squirrel, you're just a regular squirrel!"
Squirrel says: "Nyaah!"
Squirrel says: ""?"
Squirrel says: "No."
Squirrel says: "Do I wanna fly away from this place now?"
Squirrel says: "Yes."
Squirrel says: "Would I make a break for it if I had a buddy to break out with?"
Squirrel says: "Yes."
Finn says: "Hey buddy."
Squirrel says: "What?"
Finn says: "I got it!"
Owl says: "What are you doing regular, nonflying squirrel?"
Owl says: "Put that back!"
Owl says: "Well alright!"
Owl says: "Everybody after those…two!"
Finn says: "Okay!"
Finn says: "I'm gonna throw the disc alongside the branch the we'll jump on it and fly away!"
Squirrel says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Perfect!"
