The story begins on the boat of the Tree Fort. Finn, Jake, and BMO are lounging around. Finn yawns.
Jake says: "Alright."
Jake says: "Whaddaya wanna see next?"
Finn says: "A cheetah!"
Finn says: "A fart!"
BMO says: "A cookie!"
BMO says: "An external hard drive!"
BMO says: "Ooh, ooh!"
BMO says: "Change into Finn, but give him my body!"
Finn says: "BMO, your ideas are boring."
BMO says: "What?"
BMO says: "Your head on my body isn't boring!"
BMO says: "It's weird!"
Jake says: "Alright, I'll try to turn into a cheetah farting."
Jake says: "I can't do the spots."
The group notices sparkles on the Tree Fort's leafroof.
Finn says: "Sparkles on the house?"
Finn says: "LET'S SQUISH 'EM!"
Finn and Jake jump into the Fort through the weeping willow leaves. They chase the sparkles to a secret room in the Fort, containing a holo-message player and a holo-cartridge.
Jake says: "Did you squish the sparkles?"
Finn says: "No."
Finn says: "They're around this holo-message player."
Finn says: "It's got a cartridge with it."
Jake says: "Oh, snap!"
Jake says: "Well, plop that cartridge in the slot, playah!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Okay!"
The holo-player activates, and the late Joshua walks into view in the 3D holo video.
Finn says: "Dad!!"
Jake says: "Dad!!"
Joshua says: "If you're hearing this prerecorded hologram message, it's because I passed on, and my spirit sparkles guided you to its secret hiding place."
Joshua says: "Right now, I'm holding both of you in my hands."
Joshua says: "You're both still little squishy babies."
Joshua says: "I made you boys something."
Joshua says: "It's a dungeon."
Joshua says: "A proper dungeon."
Joshua says: "Full of evil monsters, traps, and magic."
Joshua says: "The whole kazoo!"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Kickin'!"
Jake says: "Kickin'!"
Finn says: "Kickin'!"
Jake says: "Kickin'!"
Joshua says: "Now, this next part of the message is just for you, Jake, so Finn, cover your ears."
Joshua says: "Jake..."
Joshua says: "really, this dungeon is for Finn."
Joshua says: "I know I won't be around forever, and I wanna make something that will force Finn to toughen up."
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Joshua says: "Now, tell Finn to uncover his ears now."
Jake says: "Dude, take your hands off your head."
Finn says: "WHAT?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake slaps Finn's arms off his head.
Joshua says: "Alright, boys."
Joshua says: "Now to give you some incentive, at the end of the dungeon, I'm going to put the Family Sword."
Joshua says: "It's made out of Demon's Blood."
Just then, the Blood Demon appears behind Joshua in a wall of flames.
Finn says: "Whoa, what the--?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Whoa, dang!"
Blood Demon says: "Give me back my blood, Joshua!"
Joshua says: "Kee Oth Rama Pancake."
Blood Demon says: "Waaaaah!!"
Jake says: "Whoa!!"
Finn says: "Geez-louise!"
Finn and Jake high-five.
Joshua says: "The dungeon's eighty paces west of here under a dumb-lookin' rock."
Joshua says: "And Finn, this dungeon's gonna kick your tail."
Joshua says: "I bet you won't even get past the first trial, ya whiny baby!"
The player deactivates.
Finn says: "What??"
Finn says: "What was that about?"
Jake says: "Uh..."
Scene switches to outside in the grasslands. Finn and Jake are near the dumb-looking rock.
Dumb Rock says: "Duh..."
Dumb Rock says: "duh..."
Dumb Rock says: "du-ugh..."
Dumb Rock says: "duh..."
Finn pushes the rock aside revealing a hole. He jumps down.
Finn says: "Whoo!"
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Burgers and hotdogs!"
Jake says: "Yeah, yeah, YEAH!"
Finn says: "Wait, Jake!"
Jake says: "But..."
Jake says: "burgers and hotdogs.."
Finn says: "Didn't you say you were hungry for burgers this morning?"
Jake says: "Yeah, so?"
Finn says: "And I said I was hungry for hotdogs?"
Jake says: "Mm-hmm, I remember."
Finn says: "I don't think those burgers and hotdogs are burgers and hotdogs at all."
Finn stops in front of the hotdogs. The ketchup on one of them suddenly turns into mustard. Finn kicks it Aaaaaah... BOO! and the Hamburger Monster and the Hot Dog Monster awaken. Jake attempts to run and Finn grabs hold of him. Finn charges, dodges the Hot Dog Monster's attack, and jumps on it; he runs on it until it head-butts him and Jake to the ground. When the monster picks its head back up, Finn and Jake are seen to be still on it. When the monster attempts to slam its face on the ground again, Finn takes out its brain, and Jake says, "Ew." The duo lands in the Hamburger Monster and its heads explode. Finn and Jake quickly escape and Finn kicks the exit with a, "HI-YAH!!" making it crumble. Jake approaches a hamburger which is part of the Hamburger Monster and attempts to eat it.
Jake says: "Aaaahh..."
Finn says: "Look!"
The duo runs up to it, and Finn places the cartridge in the player. The player activates.
Joshua says: "Finn, cover up those nubs on your head."
Finn says: "Man..."
Finn says: "again?"
Joshua says: "Alright."
Joshua says: "Hey, Jake, I wanna remind you what this dungeon's for."
Joshua says: "In order for Finn to stop whining, he needs to be put through a trial that forces him to take charge of a situation."
Jake says: "But Dad, Finn's already figured that out."
Jake says: "He's a good kid with a kind heart."
Joshua says: "Remember, Jake, this is a prerecorded holo-message."
Joshua says: "I can't hear you if you're talking to me right now."
Finn says: "I'm gonna go walk around!"
Jake says: "Okay!"
Joshua says: "Jake, I need your help."
Joshua says: "You gotta call Finn a whiny baby."
Jake says: "But—"
Joshua says: "Butts are for pooping!"
Joshua says: "Do it for Poppy!"
Player deactivates.
Jake says: "Finn!"
Finn says: "Over here!"
Finn says: "Check it out, Jake."
Finn says: "I found two ways."
Finn says: "This way has some kinda flower trap, and that way..."
Finn says: "has that guy."
Ugly Monster says: "None shall pass!"
Jake says: "Ugh..."
Jake says: "Let's take the flower path!"
Finn says: "Mmm."
Ugly Monster says: "Wait!"
Ugly Monster says: "Why don't you wanna take my path?!"
Ugly Monster says: "!"
Jake says: "Because..."
Jake says: "you're super gross, man."
Ugly Monster says: "Oh..."
Finn says: "Cheer up, man."
Finn says: "We're only tellin' you you're gross because we're your bros."
Ugly Monster says: "Really?"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Bros are real with each other, and you're gross, brother."
Finn says: "Take a bath."
Ugly Monster says: "Thanks, brother."
Ugly Monster says: "Hahaha."
Finn says: "Hahaha, no probs."
Finn says: "Hey, what did Dad say?"
Jake says: "Um..."
Jake says: "He said he's surprised a whiny baby like you made it this far."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Why's Dad sayin' all that jive??"
Jake says: "Mm..."
Joshua appears in Jakes imagination.
Imaginary Joshua says: "Jake, do it for Poppy!"
Jake says: "Because..."
Jake says: "you cry like a baby..."
Jake says: "Baby!"
Finn says: "Dude..."
Finn says: "you're pickin' on me, too?"
Jake says: "Whoa."
The three fruit witches are seen floating over a table filled with various delicious-looking fruit.
Finn says: "I don't even cry much."
Finn says: "I only cry when it's healthy, like when people die."
Brown-haired witch says: "Partake of the fruit..."
Finn says: "Pff, blech..."
Finn says: "If I didn't cry when people died, I'd have a cold butt for a heart."
Blonde witch says: "The fruuuuit..."
Jake says: "Waaaah, I cry when people die."
Jake says: "Waaah, I'm Finn."
Black-haired witch says: "Partake of the fruit!"
Finn says: "Maybe I will partake of the fruit."
The witches gather around excitedly, further urging Finn to eat it.
Jake says: "Dude, don't eat that!!"
Finn says: "Why not?"
Finn says: "All the people that I care about in this world are being wads."
Jake makes a worried noise and an imaginary Joshua appears again.
Imaginary Joshua says: "Don't you blow Poppy's cover!"
Finn almost eats the apple, but Jake jumps in and grabs it from his hands just in time. Jake force-feeds the black-haired witch the apple, causing her to grow vines out of her mouth and eye sockets. The vines cover her body.
Finn says: "Whoa."
The vines covering the witch fall off to reveal an apple. After Jake slaps the second apple out of Finn's hand, the two remaining fruit witches feed the apple to their pets, revealing the blood and bones of the now dead fruit witch covering the apple's core.
Jake says: "Time to go, baby."
Jake says: "Finn, come on!"
Finn says: "I'm gonna hang here."
Finn says: "With these fruit babes."
Finn says: "They'll be my best buds now."
Jake says: "Rrrr..."
Jake says: "Yah!"
Jake comes to a wall and looks up; the witches follow in hot pursuit. He uses his powers to climb the wall quickly and the witches chase him and Finn. Jake farts on the witches, making them fall screaming. Jake stretches over the wall, puts Finn down, and turns into a cheetah pointing at the next cartridge.
Jake says: "There's another cartridge."
Jake says: "Alright, man, Dad told me not to tell you this, but—"
Imaginary Joshua appears.
Imaginary Joshua says: "Don't tell 'im!"
Jake says: "You're not real."
Jake says: "Dad asked me to call you "Baby" because he wants you to be tough."
Finn says: "But I'm tough!"
Finn says: "My whole body is a callus!"
Finn says: "Hmmph."
Jake activates the player.
Joshua says: "Hey, hey!"
Joshua says: "Finn!"
Joshua says: "Jake!"
Joshua says: "You made it past the fruit witches!"
Joshua says: "Hey, did they make you cry, Finn?"
Joshua says: "Huh?"
Joshua says: "Huh?"
Joshua says: "WAAAAAH!!"
Finn says: "DAD!"
Jake says: "DAD!"
They run inside to find a dark room with the demon blood sword in it.
Finn says: "Dad's sword!"
Jake finds a bunch of cartridges and another player/recorder. He activates the player.
Joshua says: "Hey, Jake, when Finn finishes this dungeon, play this tape for him..."
Joshua's voice can barely be heard in the background as Finn attempts to pull out the sword but fails. The Evil Monster comes out of the shadows laughing and hits Finn.
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "Dude!"
Jake says: "Use your karate biz!"
Finn says: "Ugh..."
Finn says: "I—"
Finn says: "I can't, man."
Finn says: "I suck."
Finn says: "I'm a whiny baby, and I'm fat, and all those things Dad said about me!"
Jake says: "Dude..."
Jake says: "Dad loves you!"
The monster hits Finn yet again and laughs. Jake looks at the player. He puts a cartridge in and it activates.
Joshua says: "Finn!"
Joshua says: "If you're seeing this prerecorded holo-message, it's because you finished the dungeon that I made for you."
Joshua says: "I'm proud of you."
Joshua says: "You're gonna do great things in this world."
Joshua says: "I love you, son."
Finn smiles and stands. The monster hits him and laughs. Finn is now irritated. Joshua's Final Message Remix begins as Jake tampers with the prerecorded messages. Finn pulls the sword out of the ground and stabs the monster in its crystal eye. He then throws the monster into the pit. Jake comes up to Finn, and they smile at each other.
Dumb Rock says: "Duh..."
Dumb Rock says: "Duh..."
Joshua says: "I made you boys something."
Joshua says: "It's babies."
Joshua says: "Full of babies."
Joshua says: "..."
Joshua says: "the family sword."
Joshua says: "It's made out of—"
Joshua says: "babies."
Jake says: "You know I don't think you're a baby, right?"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "I know."
Jake says: "That sword is sweet!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "I'm stoked to slay some evil with it."
Blood Demon suddenly appears in front of Finn and Jake.
Blood Demon says: "Joshua!"
Blood Demon says: "Return my blood to me, or by demon's law, I will cut off your love handles!!!"
Blood Demon says: "Joshua, we go way back."
Blood Demon says: "Come on!"
Blood Demon says: "Just give me back my blood!"
Joshua says: "Kee Oth Rama Pancake."
Blood Demon says: "NOOOOOOO!!!"
The player deactivates, and the duo walks on like nothing happened.
Finn says: "Man..."
Finn says: "Dad was cool."
Jake says: "Yeah."
They both laugh, and the episode ends.
