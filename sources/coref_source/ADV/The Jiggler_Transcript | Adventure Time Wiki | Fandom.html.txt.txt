The episode starts with Finn and Jake walking away from an unknown, burning city.
Finn says: "Baby!"
Jake says: "Ooo!"
Finn says: "I know what you need."
Jake says: "What's that?"
Finn says: "You want your little baby socks, for your little baby feet."
Jake says: "Woo!"
Finn says: "Baby!"
Jake says: "Yeah?"
Finn says: "I know what you crave."
Jake says: "Oh, yeah?"
Jake says: "What's that?"
Finn says: "You want to poop your pants all day long."
Finn says: "Well, baby behave!"
Jake says: "Hey, how can you sing like that, dude?"
Finn says: "Remember when I swallowed that little computer?"
Jake says: "Oh, yeah."
Finn and Jake arrive at a small house and drop off fruits and a string of sausages at the doorstep.
Finn says: "Alright, Stanley."
Finn says: "You and your family are safe..."
Finn says: "Again..."
Jake says: "Seriously, Stanley."
Jake says: "For a watermelon you get into trouble way more often than you should."
Finn and Jake are walking across the Grass Lands and Jake is whistling.
A creature rolls up behind them, whistling and knocks Jake off his feet.
Jake says: "W-whoa!"
Finn says: "What the..."
Finn says: "Shmow-zow!"
Finn says: "Look at that!"
Jake says: "That..."
Jake says: "is the most adorable thing I have ever seen."
Jake says: "And he loves your baby song."
Jake says: "Sing some more of it, dude."
Finn says: "Alright."
Finn says: "Baby!"
Finn says: "You lookin' so good."
Finn says: "You lookin' like you might..."
Finn says: "want some baby food."
The creature is dancing along to the song.
Jake says: "Keep it going, man!"
Finn says: "Baby!"
Finn says: "You lookin' so fine."
Finn says: "You lookin' like you might..."
Finn says: "just start cryin'."
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Dude!"
Finn says: "This guy..."
Finn says: "is a pal for life!"
Finn says: "It looks like he's got two jiggly bellies stuck together."
Jake says: "I've got that on my back."
Jake says: "I call it my butt."
The creature jiggles Jake's butt.
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "He's the Jiggler."
Finn says: "You are the best thing ever."
Finn says: "Let's take the Jiggler back to the house and just stick him by our bed so we can wake up..."
Finn says: "Next to a little dancing guy every morning!"
Jake says: "Next to a little dancing guy every morning!"
Finn, Jake and the Jiggler walk towards the Tree Fort.
Finn says: "I gotta tuck you in, girl."
Finn says: "I gotta sing you sweet melodies about babies."
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Little baby feet!"
The scene changes to inside the Tree Fort.
Finn says: "Welcome to your new home."
Finn says: "Feast your eyes on..."
Finn says: "everything!"
Finn grunts and tears a toothbrush in half, vertically.
Jake says: "What are you doing?"
Finn says: "Splitting my toothbrush in half, so he can use half."
Finn says: "Here you go."
Finn says: "It's for your teeth."
Finn says: "Like this."
The Jiggler swishes the toothbrush around the inside of its mouth.
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "You got it."
Jake says: "Enough hygiene."
Jake says: "Let's get to it!"
Music plays and the Jiggler begins to dance while holding its toothbrush.
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Toothbrush dance."
Finn says: "This is cool!"
They all start dancing together, Finn and Jake copying the Jiggler's moves.
Jake breaks a table in half while dancing.
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn and Jake break more objects while dancing and laughing.
The scene cuts to night-time.
Finn says: "I'm not tired!"
Finn says: "How about you, Jake?"
Jake is sleeping on the floor.
Finn says: "Maybe we should go upstairs."
Finn blows out the candle and curls up on the end of his bed.
The scene changes to morning, where Jake is making tea.
Finn says: "Mornin', Jake!"
Jake says: "Mornin'."
Finn says: "Are you ready to get down?"
Finn says: "Let's get this party started!"
Jake says: "Yeah, ok."
Finn says: "Where's the little guy?"
Jake says: "Over there."
The Jiggler is face-down on the back of a bench.
Finn says: "Hey, pal."
Finn says: "You ready to cut loose?"
Finn says: "Wake and shake, buddy."
Finn says: "Let's do this thing!"
Jake says: "Slam-a-cow!"
Jake says: "That fool looks rumped."
Finn says: "What do you mean?"
Jake says: "Well, look at him."
Jake says: "He's all limp..."
Jake says: "and weird."
Finn says: "Aww..."
Finn says: "I bet he just needs some breakfast after a night of extraordinary jiggling."
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Let's combine everything we can find in the kitchen..."
Finn says: "and have the Jiggler drink it!"
Finn says: "That'll wake him up!"
Finn says: "And then we can..."
Finn says: "Get  doooowwwn!"
Jake says: "He doesn't want to drink that goop, man."
Finn says: "Then let's just give him some, uh..."
Finn says: "purple whatevers."
Jake says: "You mean the grapes?"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Whatever."
Finn feeds the Jiggler a grape and the Jiggler swallows it.
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "I think he's diggin' it!"
The Jiggler's body contorts and it makes a strange humming noise.
Jake says: "That doesn't sound good."
The Jiggler's body violently changes color and shape.
The Jiggler stops contorting and changing color.
Finn says: "Uhh..."
Jake says: "Uh, you think we..."
Jake says: "think we fed the wrong hole?"
Jake flips the Jiggler upside-down.
Finn says: "Nah."
Finn says: "He just doesn't like purple whatevers."
Finn says: "What we need to do is figure out what he likes to eat."
Finn says: "Here, Jiggler."
Finn says: "What kind of food do you like?"
Finn says: "Meat?"
Finn says: "Some banana?"
Finn says: "This looks like corn..."
Finn says: "I think."
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "hot dog."
Finn says: "Stanley the watermelon."
Finn says: "Look!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "He likes it!"
The Jiggler reaches up and pulls the drawings off of the paper.
Finn says: "Wow!"
Jake says: "No way!"
The Jiggler slurps the drawings into its mouth and eats them.
Finn says: "His favorite food..."
Finn says: "is drawings!"
Finn says: "Awesome!"
Jake says: "Holy fig, that's awesome!"
Jake says: "What food are you drawing now?"
Finn says: "I'm drawing a picture of you."
Jake says: "Well, don't feed it me!"
Finn says: "Come on."
Finn says: "Eat him up, Jiggler!"
The Jiggler slurps the drawing off of the paper, but Jake pulls him away before he can eat it.
Jake says: "No!"
The drawing of Jake floats towards them.
Finn says: "Ahhhhh."
Jake says: "Dude!"
Jake says: "You eating me is just as bad as the Jiggler eating me."
Finn says: "Well..."
Finn says: "You gonna eat yourself, tough guy?"
Jake says: "Yes."
Jake says: "If that is what must be done."
Jake chews the drawing of himself and swallows.
Jake says: "I taste awesome."
Finn says: "Ok."
Finn says: "Alright."
Finn says: "Now, let's get back to some jiggling!"
Jake says: "I'll get the tunes!"
The Jiggler is shaking and whimpering.
Finn and Jake are dancing.
Finn says: "Like this."
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Woo!"
Finn says: "Come on Jiggler!"
Finn says: "wiggle and whistle!"
Jake says: "Yeah, Jiggler."
Jake says: "Go nuts!"
Jake says: "Go nuts like there's bugs on your butts!"
The Jiggler, looking sick, shakes its head and then pink juice spurts out of the hole on the top of its head and it collapses.
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Jiggler?"
Jake says: "What the heck?"
Jake says: "What's wrong with him?"
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "There's nothing wrong with him."
Finn says: "We just gotta plug up his holes."
Finn sticks his finger into the hole that is gushing juice.
Finn says: "See?"
Finn says: "That worked."
Finn says: "Ready to jiggle again, little guy?"
Juice gushes from a different hole.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Oh, man..."
Jake plugs up the hole that is leaking, but another hole starts to leak.
Finn says: "Quick!"
Finn says: "We gotta plug those holes!"
Jake walks away and juice gushes all over Finn.
Finn says: "Jake, hurry!"
Jake says: "All I could find was your glass eye collection!"
Finn says: "What about your eyepatch collection?"
Jake says: "Aw, man."
Jake says: "They're in mint condition."
Finn says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "Alright!"
Jake says: "Coming!"
Finn and Jake start plugging up the Jiggler's holes with glass eyes and eyepatches.
Jake says: "One..."
Jake says: "more..."
Jake says: "patch!"
Jake says: "Finished."
Jake says: "Ugh."
Jake says: "He looks terrible."
Jake says: "Finn, I know you don't want to hear this, but I think we should cut our losses and bring this fella back to where we found him."
Finn says: "We can't just abandon him."
Finn says: "Look at him, Jake."
Finn says: "He needs us now more than ever."
Finn says: "Just need to take better care of you from now on, right little guy?"
The Jiggler swells and then explodes, spraying pink juice everywhere.
Finn says: "Jiggler!"
The Jiggler's body stretches in every direction and drapes the inside of the Tree Fort like taffy.
Jake says: "Oh..."
Jake says: "Finn."
Jake says: "Ok..."
Jake says: "Our pet exploded."
Jake says: "Maybe we can..."
Jake says: "scrape him up!"
Jake says: "And..."
Jake says: "eyuhh..."
The Jiggler tries to whistle, but only makes raspberry noises.
Finn says: "Let's gather him up, Jake."
Finn says: "He's all over the place..."
Finn says: "even between the floorboards!"
Jake says: "And the cupboards!"
Finn says: "And the galoshes!"
Jake says: "I wonder..."
Jake says: "Where's his heinie?"
Jake looks over and sees the Jiggler's heinie on their phonograph.
Jake says: "Found it!"
Jake says: "Come here, you!"
The Jiggler's heinie jumps away and runs around.
Jake says: "Hey!"
Finn and Jake gather all of the Jiggler and bring him together.
Finn says: "Come on."
Finn says: "Let's put him back together."
Jake says: "Ok."
Finn says: "Squeeze real hard."
Finn says: "He's slipping!"
Finn and Jake hug with the Jiggler in between them.
Jake says: "Got him!"
The Jiggler gets pressed back into a globular mass.
Jake says: "Well, at least he's all in one piece."
The Jiggler collapses.
Jake says: "Sheesh."
Jake says: "You think he's dead?"
Finn says: "No way!"
Finn says: "I won't let you die, guy!"
Finn says: "Not this time."
Finn blows into various holes on the Jiggler's head and then kisses it.
Jake says: "Finn."
Jake says: "Stop it, man."
Jake says: "What are you doing?"
Finn says: "I'm kissing him!"
Finn says: "What do you think?"
Finn says: "It's all I could think to do."
Jake says: "Just put him down."
Finn lays him down and the Jiggler makes kissing motions with its lips.
The Jiggler begins leaving many different colored kiss-marks on the floor.
Finn says: "He's kissing colors with his dying breath."
The Jiggler has painted a picture with his colored kiss-marks.
Jake says: "I think he's trying to tell us something."
The Jiggler crawls up to the image of its mother and hugs it, whistling.
Finn says: "We took this child away from its mama, Jake."
Finn says: "We're kidnappers and murderers!"
Finn says: "I just wanted to have fun and jiggle!"
Jake says: "Look..."
Jake says: "Chill out, ok?"
Jake says: "We can fix this."
Jake says: "Check it out."
Jake says: "His mom looks like she's out by Stanley's house..."
Jake says: "where we found the Jiggler."
Jake says: "If we get him back to her, she'll be able to fix him up!"
Finn says: "Then there's no time to spare."
The scene changes to the Grass Lands, near where they found the Jiggler.
Finn says: "Shhh."
Finn says: "Just hold on a little longer, buddy."
There is a whistling sound in the distance.
Jake says: "Did you hear that?"
Jake says: "Whistling!"
Finn and Jake enter a cave.
Finn says: "Perpendicular!"
Finn says: "It's the mama!"
Mama Jiggler and several babies are sitting and splashing in a pool of pink juice, which is pouring out of Mama Jiggler's holes.
The Jiggler stretches towards them and whistles pathetically.
Jake says: "Look!"
Jake says: "The little guy wants to go home!"
Finn says: "Well."
Finn says: "This is it, buddy."
Jake says: "Be well."
The Jiggler walks up to Mama Jiggler and she sniffs it; She goes into a rage, screeching and changing colors.
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Stop that!"
Finn fends off Mama Jiggler and carries the Jiggler to safety.
Finn says: "I don't understand."
Finn says: "That crazy mama almost killed him."
Jake says: "He feels cold."
Finn says: "What are we supposed to do now, man?"
Finn says: "We can't bring him home, or he'll..."
Finn says: "or he'll..."
Finn tears up and the Jiggler deflates a little.
Finn says: "Dang it!"
Finn says: "Why doesn't she love him?"
Finn says: "I love him!"
Finn says: "Ahhhh!"
Jake says: "Finn, wait!"
Finn runs at Mama Jiggler with the Jiggler in his arms, but she goes into a rage again and attacks him.
Finn says: "Mama's supposed to love baby!"
Finn says: "She's supposed to love baby!"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake notices the other babies floating in the pool of pink juice.
Jake says: "Oh, man!"
Finn says: "It's yours, idiot!"
Finn jumps up on top of Mama Jiggler's head and holds the Jiggler up close to her face.
Finn says: "Don't you recognize your own baby?"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "I figured it out, dude."
Jake says: "It's the juice."
Jake says: "The Jiggler needs to smell like its mama's juice."
Jake says: "That's how wild animals know what’s going on..."
Jake says: "and this guy right here is all drained out."
Jake says: "We gotta toss it in the soup, brother."
Finn says: "Alright."
Finn says: "Ok."
Finn says: "I loved you, baby."
Finn says: "I hope you know that."
Finn says: "Word to your motheeeerrrrr!"
The Jiggler flies through the air and lands in the pool of juice; It now looks normal and begins to whistle.
Mama Jiggler picks it up and sniffs it, then holds it against her cheek and they both whistle.
Finn says: "Awww..."
Jake says: "Awww..."
Finn says: "I'll never kidnap again."
Jake says: "You said it!"
Jake says: "That was a nightmare."
The episode ends.
