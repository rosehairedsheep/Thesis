The episode starts in Marauder Village where two Marauders are refilling their mugs.
Squid Bartender says: "You guys sure you want another round of squid ink?"

Finn says: "What did you call me?"
Head Marauder says: "You can't just walk away from a roughhouse!"
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Listen up you cold-hearted marauders!"
Finn says: "Someone's out there crying for help and I'm not gonna ignore that!"

Head Marauder says: "Ya see the problem here?"
Finn says: "Well."
Finn says: "Well what if we rotate the entire mountain 180 degrees around, so the mountain’s facing the other direction."

Head Marauder says: "Sounds fine with me!"
Finn says: "What do ya say mountain!"
Mountain Man says: "That’s okay."
Mountain Man says: "Only if you guys promise to stay healthy and not roughhouse after you rotate me."
