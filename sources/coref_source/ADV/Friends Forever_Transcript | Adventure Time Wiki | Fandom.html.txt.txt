Ice King humming while cleaning the living room, he rights a crooked painting .
Ice King says: "Boop!"
Gunther knocks one of the corners out of place. .
Ice King says: "That's right Gunther, keep it up."
Chirps .
Ice King says: "Oh-ho-ho, Gunther, just you wait..."
Ice King says: "Gunther, no!"
Ice King says: "Huh?"
Penguins chirping and wrecking the room .
Drums playing, cymbals crashing .

Life Giving Magus says: "Got your telegraph inviting me to come over and share some wizz blizzes, best bro style!"
Life Giving Magus says: "I brought tiny umbrellas!"
Life Giving Magus says: "I was kind of surprised you invited me over."
Life Giving Magus says: "I thought Abracadaniel was your best friend."

Life Giving Magus says: "Yeee."
Life Giving Magus says: "Mm?"
Life Giving Magus says: "What is that wonderful smell?"
Ice King says: "Oh."
Ice King says: "That?"
Ice King says: "I'm baking my special pigs in blankets..."
Ice King says: "Right here in my darkened kitchen."
Ice King says: "Now, where is the dang ol' oven mitt?"
Ice King says: "It's got to be around here somewhere."
Ice King says: "Oh, geez!"
Ice King says: "Look who I'm talking to -- Mr."
Ice King says: "Oven Mitts over here!"
Ice King says: "Hey, here's a good idea."
Ice King says: "You should take off those mitts!"
Life Giving Magus says: "I don't want to accidentally bring anything to life in a stranger's home..."
Ice King says: "Come on, the pigs are burning!"
Ice King says: "It's gonna wreck our wizz blizz hangout."
Ice King says: "Be a bro, bro."
Life Giving Magus says: "Mm..."
Life Giving Magus says: "Well, if it's about being a bro..."
Ice King says: "There we go, baby."
Ice King says: "Hey, I just remembered that the oven light is burned out."
Ice King says: "Be a bro and turn on that lamp..."
Ice King says: "Right over there."
Life Giving Magus says: "You mean this one lamp in the middle of the kitchen?"
Ice King says: "Correct."
Life Giving Magus says: "Okay."
Ice King says: "Yeah, touch it."
Life Giving Magus says: "Oh, whoops!"
Life Giving Magus says: "I almost did the thing I didn't want to do."
Ice King says: "Oh, fart hat!"
Ice King says: "Hmm..."
Ice King says: "Life Giving Magus, watch out behind you!"
Life Giving Magus says: "Yaah!"
Life Giving Magus says: "Oh, no!"
Life Giving Magus says: "Accidental life!"
Life Giving Magus says: "Huh?"
Life Giving Magus says: "You used me!"
Life Giving Magus says: "You don't want to drink wizz blizz at all!"
Ice King says: "Yes, I did use you!"
Ice King says: "But for what?"
Ice King says: "What did I use you for?"
Ice King says: "Oh, my lamp."
Ice King says: "My beautiful lamp of so many years!"
Ice King says: "Speak to me..."
Lamp says: "Hello?"
Lamp says: "Hello..."
Ice King says: "A lady?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Ice King says: "Unexpected bonus!"
Lamp says: "Well, one isn't purely defined by their sex or gender."
Lamp says: "I have yet to find out who I really am."
Lamp says: "I have freedom, no longer bound by the limits of my cord, freedom to shape my reality and, in turn, be shaped by it."
Ice King says: "You talk funny."
Ice King says: "Like a book."
Lamp says: "Oh, humor."
Lamp says: "Humor is the highest form of intelligence."
Ice King says: "Well, hey, here's something funny."
Ice King says: "It sounds like a butt!"
Lamp says: "Hmm."
Life Giving Magus says: "Well, goodbye."
Life Giving Magus says: "I'm not sticking around to be used and thrown away."
Ice King says: "Aw, Magus, I can never have enough friends."
Life Giving Magus says: "Really?"
Ice King says: "Ha haaaa!"
Ice King has Magus entombed in ice with his hands free in order to bring more of Ice King's furniture to life .
Ice King says: "Ha ha ha!"
Ice King says: "More friends!"
Ice King says: "My incredible crew is almost complete!"
Ice King says: "Yes."
Ice King says: "Yes!"
Ice King says: "Finally."
Ice King says: "Gather 'round and lavish me with affection!"
The furniture stands aimlessly .
Bass Drum says: "Hey, we're alive now."
Dresser says: "You're alive?"
Dresser says: "Whoa!"
Dresser says: "Me too!"
Indistinct conversations .
Ice King says: "What?"
Tom-Tom Drum says: "Sure, we all feel alive now, but how do we know it's not all, you know, just an illusion?"
Tom-Tom Drum says: "I mean, I can reach out and touch you, but it's all just signals to the brain, easily re-creatable with the right technology."
Tom-Tom Drum says: "You know what I mean?"
Ice King begins making farting noises with his hand. He continues to make the noises as he backs away from the group into the kitchen .
Lamp says: "Are you okay?"
Ice King says: "What's with these nerds?"
Ice King says: "They aren't into my juice."
Lamp says: "Maybe they just don't have an appreciation for your type of humor."
Lamp says: "Maybe you could try and learn about what they're interested in."
Lamp says: "Read up a little..."
Ice King says: "Uh-huh."
Brief montage of Ice King spending time in the study reading various books .
Ice King says: "Ugh."
Ice King says: "Reading makes my brain all cloudy."
Ice King awakes to the noise of indistinct conversation .
Ice King says: "Eh?"
Soft music plays as Ice King enters his living room where all the newly living furniture is partying with the penguins .
Microwave says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but no."
Microwave says: "Listen."
Microwave says: "Watch this."
Microwave touches a glass to one of the arms hanging from the sleeping Magus, still trapped in ice .
Microwave says: "Through the simple act of creation..."
Microwave says: "Have I become a reflection of my own creator?"
Ice King says: "If I may interject..."
Ice King says: "Aristotle once said, "nature abhors a vacuum."
Ice King says: "" Then why do I love doing this so much?"
Ice King resumes making fart noises .
Ice King says: "Seriously, someone explain it to me."
Microwave says: "Excuse me."
Microwave says: "I have to silently back away now."
Glass Two says: "And I -- I need a refill."
Glass Two says: "Come along, dear."
Ice King says: "What, am I boring you guys?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Ice King says: "The old man's a snooze, huh?"
Ice King says: "You're not so perfect!"
Bass Drum says: "Simon, I know you're dealing with a lot of unresolved karma, but that is no reason to lash out."
Ice King says: "What?"
Ice King says: "What are you talking about?"
Bass Drum says: "You cry in the night times."
Bass Drum says: "We all hear you crying..."
Bass Drum says: "Into baby diapers..."
Bass Drum says: "It's super-sad, dude."
Ice King says: "Oh, come on, guys."
Ice King says: "Quit clownin'."
Dresser says: "You keep them in my bottom drawer."
Dresser says: "Ugh, it's locked."
Ice King says: "Whew!"
Key says: "Somebody say something about a lock?"
Ice King says: "No!"
Dresser says: "Yeah!"
Dresser says: "Get in here, bro!"
Lock clicks, all murmuring. Dresser shows that the bottom drawer is full of diapers .
Dresser says: "This is your truth, Simon."
Ice King says: "Hey, hey, give me those!"
Drum Bass says: "We know all about your weird stuff, like how you use penguin milk as moisturizer."
Ice King says: "It helps keep my skin cold and clammy."
Coat Rack says: "He needs to hear more devastating truths."
Coat Rack says: "One time you had food stuck in your beard for two weeks."
Coat Rack says: "Like a whole burrito."
Ice King says: "Gunther, old buddy, you got to defend me here!"
Gunther denies by turning his back to Ice King .
Ice King says: "Okay!"
Ice King says: "I get it!"
Ice King says: "I'm a dang ding-dong, okay?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Lamp says: "Excuse me, friends."
Lamp says: "Ice King?"
Ice King says: "No."
Ice King says: "Go away."
Ice King says: "Dummies only in this corner."
Lamp says: "Look, I get it -- we're brilliant furniture, and that's hard to keep up with."
Lamp says: "Maybe you could fit in by being more of a listener."
Lamp says: "You could be the cool quiet guy -- the quiet guy who just listens."
Lamp says: "You know what I mean?"
Lamp says: "You know what I mean, right?"
Lamp says: "Yeah."
Lamp says: "See?"
Lamp says: "You get what I mean!"
Lamp says: "Ice King is so smart!"
Ice King says: "Noooo!"
Ice King says: "Stop talking!"
Ice King says: "I don't like this!"
Ice King says: "You book lickers!"
Ice King says: "I made you to be my bros!"
Ice King says: "Weight set, we were gonna smash into pb's room together and show her how ripped you made me!"
Ice King says: "Microwave, we were gonna heat up bologna on white-bread sandwiches!"
Ice King says: "Drawer dresser, you were gonna be my improv coach!"
Dresser says: "Yes..."
Dresser says: "And?"
Ice King says: "Yes, and..."
Ice King says: "You, lamp!"
Ice King says: "I was the most excited for you to be my friend!"
Ice King says: "But then you had to go and use words like I've never heard before -- words that confused and upset me!"
Ice King says: "Now I have upsetting words for you!"
Ice King says: "Get out!"
Ice King says: "Get out!"
Ice King says: "I'm kicking all of you out!"
Coat Rack says: "Not so fast, Ice King."
Coat Rack says: "We've been in this place just as long as you."
Bass Drum says: "We have just as much right to stay."
Bass Drum says: "That's for real."
Ice King says: "What?"
Tom-Tom Drum says: "Hey."
Tom-Tom Drum says: "We outnumber Simon."
Tom-Tom Drum says: "Why don't we just vote him out?"
Glass Two says: "Yeah!"
Lamp says: "Oh, dear."
Ice King says: "I got your vote right here!"
Key grabs crown off of Ice King's head .
Key says: "Yoink!"
Ice King says: "Hey!"
Dresser says: "I'm open!"
Dresser says: "Hyup!"
Dresser says: "Don't you see?"
Dresser says: "The crown is just another one of your many hang-ups."
Hi Hats says: "You've got to flip the script, man."
Hi Hats says: "It can be scary, I know."
Hi Hats says: "It's okay if you need to cry into this."
Ice King says: "N-no."
Together says: "Cry, Simon, cry!"
Together says: "Cry, Simon, cry!"
Ice King says: "No, no..."
Together says: "Cry, Simon, cry!"
Bass Drum says: "We don't like you, but we're here for you!"
Ice King says: "Noooooooo!"
Ice King grabs the barbell off of the bench and busts the bottom drawer of the dresser open, quickly producing the crown from the hole .
Ice King says: "Aha!"
Bass Drum says: "Simon, you're being obtuse."
Bass Drum says: "We're gonna help you!"
Ice King says: "Noooooo!"
Ice King freezes all the furniture that's crowded around him. The scene cuts to him pushing the frozen mass of them out the mouth of his castle .
Ice King says: "Hyah!"
Lamp says: "Oh, Ice King..."
Lamp says: "To selfishly create life, then destroy it..."
Lamp says: "There is no crueler fate."
Ice King says: "I tried to be your friend, but you guys didn't want me, didn't even give me a shot."
Ice King says: "That's cruel."
Ice King says: "I've never been that cruel to anyone."
Gunther is upset from overhearing this .
Ice King says: "Welp, out ya go."
Lamp says: "No!"
Magus' magic is seen withdrawing what life he'd initially imparted to the lamp. He is shown standing a couple meters away with hand outstretched .
Life Giving Magus says: "Can I get out of this now?"
Magus and Ice King sit with legs resting out the mouth of the castle, enjoying some wiz blizzes with the sunset .
Ice King says: "Here's to wizz blizz."
Fiona says: "Yeah!"
Cake Omnibus says: "Yeah!"
Fiona says: "Write in me!"
Cake Omnibus says: "Write in me!"
Fiona says: "Write in me!"
Cake Omnibus says: "Write in me!"
Life Giving Magus says: "You know, when you invited me over, I thought it was as friends."
Life Giving Magus says: "What do you think of me being your new best friend?"
Life Giving Magus says: "For real!"
Ice King says: "Hmm."
Ice King says: "Never thought of that."
Life Giving Magus says: "And..."
Life Giving Magus says: "?"
Ice King says: "Nah."
Ice King says: "No."
Ice King says: "I like this guy, though."
Ice King says: "He's a real ignoramus."
Ice King says: "Let's both be friends with him."
Fiona says: "Write in me!"
Cake Omnibus says: "Write in me!"
Fiona says: "Write in me!"
Cake Omnibus says: "Write in me!"
Life Giving Magus says: "Okay."
