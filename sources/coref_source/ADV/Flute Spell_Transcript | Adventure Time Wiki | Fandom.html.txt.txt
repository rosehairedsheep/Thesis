Jake plays a video game.
Jake says: "BMO, I've been playing this 72 hours straight."
Jake says: "Can I please save after this battle?"
BMO says: "No, it takes up too much brain space."
Jake says: "I'm out of candles."
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Man, if Finn were here, we'd be doing this in shifts."
Jake says: "Oh, well, let's keep grinding."
BMO says: "I cannot talk and run this game at the same time."
BMO displays the main title screen of the video game.
Jake says: "Well, I guess that means I'm free."
Jake says: "I live again!"
Jake says: "♪My name is Jake, and love my life."
Jake says: "Kissin' on lady 'cause she's basically my wife."
Jake says: "Fixin' up Neptr 'cause he fell from a tree."
Jake says: "Catchin' up with Maja and Aptwe."
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant says: "♪Maja's in a coma, and she might not wake up."
Jake says: "♪I'm glad you got a friend now even though that's messed up."
Jake says: "Take T."
Jake says: "V."
Jake says: "to the market to get him into fruits."
Jake says: "Take a little nappy in my blanket cocoon..."
Jake says: "Wake up really early just to cook for my friends."
Jake says: "Later in the field at night I thought I saw death."
Jake says: "Made myself a boat, and I sailed with a whale."
Jake says: "Took T."
Jake says: "V."
Jake says: "to the market so he could try kale."
Jake says: "And some other stuff..."
Jake says: "♪ Ah!"
Shelby says: "Nice song, Jake."
Jake says: "What a crazy 2 weeks."
Jake says: "I think I'm ready to hole up and go round tow on 'Age of Grinders'."
Jake says: "But where's Finn?"
Jake says: "I need him on this adventure."
Shelby says: "Uh, well..."
Jake says: "Hold on."
Jake says: "What?"
Shelby says: "If you don't know, I'm not sure it's my business to tell you."
Jake says: "Don't you dare, Shelby!"
Jake says: "Give up that greasy gossip!"
Shelby says: "Word on the street is, Finn's been hanging with a new lady."
Jake says: "Who the honk is it?"
Shelby says: "I don't..."
Jake says: "Muscle Princess."
Jake says: "It's perfect."
Shelby says: "I don't..."
Jake says: "Me-Mow, from the future!"
Shelby says: "Nobody knows."
Shelby says: "Finn's been keeping this on the super DL."
Jake says: "Why?"
Shelby says: "He's just trying to be careful this time."
Jake says: "Oh yeah, I get it."
Jake says: "But I still got to know who this girl is."
Shelby says: "Okay, just don't blow up his spot."
Jake says: "I won't!"
Jake slides down from the Tree Fort.
Science Cat says: "Hey, Jake."
Jake says: "Oh hey, Science Cat."
Jake says: "Where's Sword Shark?"
Science Cat says: "He died of old age."
Science Cat says: "Hey, are you gonna find out who Finn's girlfriend is?"
Jake says: "Who told you that?"
Science Cat says: "Word gets around, man."
Jake says: "Not to me, apparently."
Science Cat says: "Let me know the dirt when you find out."
Jake says: "I won't!"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "What's that?"
Jake says: "Sounds like a flute coming from above the canopy."
Jake says: "Huntress Wizard!"
Huntress Wizard says: "Stop!"
Finn stops playing the flute.
Huntress Wizard says: "This isn't working, Finn."
Jake says: "Dude."
Finn says: "Oh, hi, Jake."
Finn says: "What are you doing here?"
Jake says: "I wanted to check out your new lady friend, but I guess she just dumped you like a diaper in the dirt, bro."
Jake says: "I'm sorry, man!"
Jake says: "I want you to have a healthy relationship with someone cool."
Finn says: "That's so sweet, Jake."
Finn says: "I love you, man."
Jake says: "Me, too, man."
Jake says: "Okay, I'm okay."
Finn says: "But, dude, me and Huntress Wizard weren't together."
Finn says: "We're just trying to conjure up the Spirit of the Forest with my flute spell."
Jake says: "What the blood are you talking about?"
Finn says: "It went down like this."
Finn says: "I was just minding my own business, in my new alone place I've been hanging out at."
Finn says: "Hello."
Huntress Wizard says: "How are you playing like that?"
Finn says: "I don't know."
Finn says: "I'm just making stuff up."
Huntress Wizard says: "Something in your notes has the quality of a powerful evocation spell."
Huntress Wizard says: "What spirit guides your hands?"
Huntress Wizard says: "Tell me, or I'll put this up your nose."
Finn says: "First off, I'm a great fighter."
Finn says: "And especially agile when I'm nude, so good luck."
Finn says: "Second, my flute improv ain't no secret."
Finn says: "I let my grass hand do whatever it wants, which is usually sort of shreddy and busy."
Huntress Wizard says: "Let me see that hand!"
Huntress Wizard says: "You're what I've been looking for."
Jake says: "Looking for a dope boyfriend."
Finn says: "No man."
Finn says: "She thinks my grass arm flute playing could summon the Spirit of the Forest."
Finn says: "I've been playing different songs for 2 weeks, though, and he hasn't shown up yet."
Jake says: "Who's that, her ex-boyfriend?"
Finn says: "Uh, I guess they used to hang out, but maybe in some kind of mentor-student capacity."
Jake says: "So my theory holds."
Jake says: "You can still make this happen."
Finn says: "Yeah, I really want to help her summon this dude."
Jake says: "Finn, that's not why you're here."
Finn says: "That's why I'm here."
Jake says: "Come on."
Jake says: "Let's make some magic happen."
Finn says: "Yeah, my magic flute spell."
Huntress Wizard says: "Finn."
Huntress Wizard says: "I had an idea."
Jake says: "Hi."
Huntress Wizard says: "I think the problem is your flute."
Huntress Wizard says: "We should make you a better one from a magical tusk, like the tusk of the legendary Thunder Boar that lives in these woods."
Finn says: "I'm down for whatever if it helps."
Jake says: "I'm also here."
Huntress Wizard says: "Hey, what's up?"
Huntress Wizard says: "It's late."
Huntress Wizard says: "Why don't you guys crash at my place tonight?"
Huntress Wizard says: "We'll start the hunt first thing in the morning."
Jake says: "Ha-ha!"
Jake says: "I'm like your sleepover chaperone."
Finn says: "Grow up."
Jake says: "You grow up, you teen."
Huntress Wizard says: "So, yeah, here's the place."
Huntress Wizard says: "We got some nice soft dirt right over here."
Huntress Wizard says: "Pantry, in case you want a snack, bathroom."
Huntress Wizard says: "I got a console if you get bored, but it was a gift, but it was a gift, so I haven't really set it up yet."
Huntress Wizard says: "Night, boys."
Jake says: "Dude, I think I figured it out."
Jake says: "You can't summon the Spirit of the Forest 'cause you ain't playing that flute for him."
Jake says: "You got a crush on HW."
Finn says: "HW's just training me to live an ascetic life like her."
Jake says: "Okay, I buy that for like zero seconds."
Huntress Wizard says: "Before we hunt the Thunder Boar, you should drink from this enchanted spring."
Huntress Wizard says: "It might give you crazy dreams, but when you wake up, you'll be immune to the Boar's electrical attacks."
Finn says: "Let's roll those dice."
Jake says: "Hey, dude, are you sure you wanna do that?"
Finn says: "I've had plenty of weird dreams..."
Finn says: "Oh-okay!"
Finn says: "That was fast."
Jake as a purple bird chirps.
the Spirit of the Forest says: "Welcome."
the Spirit of the Forest says: "I am the Spirit of the Forest."
Finn says: "Wow, dude, we've been trying to summon you for weeks."
the Spirit of the Forest says: "And why do you seek me?"
Finn says: "I don't, personally, but Huntress Wizard really wants to talk to you, man."
the Spirit of the Forest says: "Did you know that a wolf's eyes are on the front of its head?"
Finn says: "But, yeah, didn't you guys used to hang?"
the Spirit of the Forest says: "Most predatory species are like that."
the Spirit of the Forest says: "This little buddy doesn't even know I'm here."
Finn says: "Fella, I don't want to have a science talk right now."
the Spirit of the Forest says: "Huntress Wizard only sees straight ahead, eyes on the prize."
the Spirit of the Forest says: "Now, why did you really need to see me?"
Finn says: "Oh, yeah!"
Finn says: "Can you make me immune to electricity?"
the Spirit of the Forest says: "Here."
Finn says: "Whoa."
the Spirit of the Forest says: "Now plunge that into your heart."
Finn says: "And this will give me immunity to electricity?"
Finn says: "I'll do it."
Finn says: "To help Huntress Wizard."
Finn yells and wakes up.
Finn says: "How long was I out?"
Jake says: "Seven long harrowing seconds."
Huntress Wizard says: "Hold still."
Finn says: "Yeah, fells fine."
Huntress Wizard says: "Great."
Huntress Wizard says: "Now we can hunt down the Thunder Boar."
Finn says: "Oh, yeah, the Boar."
Huntress Wizard says: "Try to stay focused."
Huntress Wizard says: "Magic dog, what do you smell?"
Jake says: "Mostly, Finn, but also some kind of giant wild pig."
Finn says: "There!"
Finn says: "Jake's joking."
Finn says: "I smell fine."
Huntress Wizard says: "Good work."
Thunder Boar says: "You just wanted a tusk?"
Thunder Boar says: "You could have asked!"
Finn says: "Oh."
Huntress Wizard says: "You can stop."
Huntress Wizard says: "He is not coming."
Huntress Wizard says: "He is gone for good, and I should just deal."
Finn says: "Maybe if I played it a little jazzier, like, all syncopated?"
Jake says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "Why don't you tow try playing together?"
Jake says: "Use that chemistry to guide the music."
Jake says: "Yeah, just get in there."
Jake says: "Cozy up."
Huntress Wizard says: "I guess we've tried everything else."
Jake says: "Wow..."
the Spirit of the Forest says: "Who summons me with the sweet song of longing?"
the Spirit of the Forest says: "Oh, hey-oh."
the Spirit of the Forest says: "Can you see me now?"
Huntress Wizard says: "Yes."
the Spirit of the Forest says: "How's it been going?"
Huntress Wizard says: "I've been talking to a lot of twigs."
Huntress Wizard says: "Where have you been, dude?"
the Spirit of the Forest says: "I've been right here, but the forces that drew us close became obscured as you drifted into the lifestyles of magic city livin'."
the Spirit of the Forest says: "Attracting forces come and go."
the Spirit of the Forest says: "It's the way of the world."
Jake says: "I still can't tell if you guys dated."
Huntress Wizard says: "But I'm ready to come back now."
the Spirit of the Forest says: "Are you, though?"
Jake says: "That's what I'm saying."
the Spirit of the Forest says: "Finn, who was your flute spell for?"
Finn says: "Um..."
Finn says: "I was playing my flute for you the whole time, but I knew you had a thing with this dude, and he seems cool, so I was just gonna keep playing this flute song about my secret feelings until my flute broke."
Huntress Wizard says: "I-uh, I worry that hard meat don't get eat."
Huntress Wizard says: "That is to say, if I ever find what I'm looking for, I'll become soft and I'll cease to matter in this world."
Jake says: "What?"
Huntress Wizard says: "Fear of softness is waht drove me to the mad and sad world of wizarding."
Huntress Wizard says: "And Finn..."
Finn says: "Yeah, what?"
Huntress Wizard gives Finn kiss to the mouth.
Jake gasps.
Huntress Wizard says: "My flute spell was for you, too."
Huntress Wizard says: "You're an exceptional beast, and you have great hair."
Huntress Wizard says: "But exceptional beasts like us cannot fall in love."
Huntress Wizard says: "That is the secret of ordinary people."
Jake says: "Uh, that's real dumb."
Finn says: "I agree."
Jake says: "Wait, you agree with me or her?"
Finn says: "Take it easy, Huntress Wizard."
Finn says: "Man, I can't believe all you can do is upgrade your armor in this game."
Jake says: "It's all about patience and treating each grueling repetitive battle as if it were your first."
Finn says: "Oh, snap!"
Finn says: "Finally!"
Both Finn says: "Whoo!"
Jake says: "Whoo!"
Both Finn says: "Blah!"
Jake says: "Blah!"
Finn says: "What a bad and boring game."
Finn says: "It was just what I needed."
Jake says: "I'm sorry it didn't work out with Huntress Wizard."
Jake says: "She just needs time to miss how cool you are."
Finn says: "Attracting forces come and go, man."
