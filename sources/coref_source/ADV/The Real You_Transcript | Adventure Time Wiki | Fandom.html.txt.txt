The episode begins with Finn and Jake walking through the Cotton Candy Forest carrying something. Finn whistles happily. Jake attempts to whistle, but no pitch comes out.
Finn says: "Careful!"
Finn says: "You'll wreck my gift for Princess Bubblegum."
Jake says: "Whoops."
Jake says: "Hey, what's it supposed to be, anyway?"
Finn says: "It's..."
Finn says: "a scale model of the Candy Kingdom, made out of my saliva!"
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "Sooo this means you wanna give 'er your spit, huh?"
Finn says: "Yup!"
Finn says: "HEY, NO—"
Jake says: "It's okay, dude."
Jake says: "I totally get it."
Jake says: "Haw haw haw."
Finn says: "I just wanted to give 'er somethin', uh..."
Finn says: "to celebrate her science..."
Finn says: "thing."
Jake says: "You mean her..."
Jake says: "Super Science Barbecue?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "You think it's science-y enough for 'er?"
Jake says: "Relax."
Jake says: "She'll love it!"
Jake says: "And then she'll love you."
Jake says: "Heh heh heh..."
Finn says: "Wha?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Hey, there's Bubblegum!"
Jake says: "Princess!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hi, guys!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Just gettin' the grill cookin' for tonight's BBQ!"
Finn says: "Oh!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "What's that you got behind your back there, Finny?"
Finn says: "Oh, I..."
Finn says: "I made you somethin'."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Really?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Can I scope it?"
Finn says: "Yes."
Finn says: "Close your eyes."
Princess Bubblegum says: "A'ight."
Finn says: "Get ready to open your eyes!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Achoo!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Can I open my eyes?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm gonna open my eyes."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, Finn!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's pink!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I love pink!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, thanks, Finn!"
Finn makes a blushing smile.
Chet says: "Princess!"
Chet says: "Princess!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Better not say nothing, you!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yes, Chet?"
Chet says: "Um..."
Chet says: "So, I called grill-meister for the BBQ, but Pepper won't give up the spatula!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Fine, fine."
Peppermint Butler says: "You can have it..."
Peppermint Butler says: "..."
Peppermint Butler says: "when you pry it from my cold, dead hands!!"
Chet says: "NOOOO!!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hey..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "If you two aren't watching the grill, then who's watching the..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "."
Princess Bubblegum says: "..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "GRILL?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Finn gasps and jumps in. He knocks the flaming charcoal out of the grill and notices a pile of steaks.
Finn says: "MEAT!!"
Finn says: "WAH!!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "That was awesome."
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Heh..."
Finn says: "Thanks, Princess."
Finn says: "I'm always happy to help."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I see."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Your heroic brain is fascinating in a scientific way."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Many scientific minds are going to be speaking at my barbeque."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You should talk about something, too."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You'll do that for me, right?"
Finn says: "Anything you want..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Thanks, Finn!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "See you tonight?"
Jake says: "Buddy, just breathe into me."
Finn says: "Ah?"
Jake says: "You're just gonna give a speech to a buncha' brainiacs."
Finn says: "I can't hang with those guys."
Finn says: "I'm full of stupid."
Jake says: "Then we'll just borrow some brains by goin' to the place where knowledge liiives!"
Finn says: "Oh, Brain Town!"
Jake says: "Uh, no, the library."
Finn says: "The Library of the Undead..."
Jake says: "No..."
Jake says: "Just the regular library."
Finn looks unimpressed. The scene switches to the library. Finn and Jake are reading. Jake stares at his book, then at Finn, then back at his book.
Jake says: "Hey, Finn, let's split."
Jake says: "This turned out to be boring."
Finn says: "But I have to cram this info!"
Jake says: "Okay, okay..."
Jake says: "I'll just keep readin' this book about figs."
Finn says: "And I'll just read this book about pigs."
Finn blinks twice. Jake blinks. Finn blinks again. Finn notices that their blinks make sounds. Jake blinks twice. Finn smiles as he blinks rhythmically.
Jake says: "Haha!"
Jake says: "Whatcha doin'?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "I'm bored now, too!"
They start goofing off and making noise.
Finn says: "But..."
Finn says: "w-w-we were just enthusiastic about learning!"
Scene transition. Finn and Jake are walking elsewhere.
Finn says: "Hmm..."
Finn says: "So, if I can't book-learn for beans, we'll just get some smarty to explain scientific junk to me!"
Jake says: "Yeah, then you can at least sound smart..."
Jake says: "but where're you gonna find someone like that?"
They arrive at a big, hollow apple near Tree Trunks' house.
Finn says: "Jake..."
Finn says: "we're goin' to college."
Finn looks inside the apple. A professor worm is teaching student worms.
Professor worm says: "And the great question endures..."
Professor worm says: ""Who would win in a battle between Nietzsche's Übermensch..."
Professor worm says: "and Mandroid?"
Professor worm says: "" The answer is..."
Professor worm says: "WEREWOLF QUEEN!"
Professor worm says: "IT'S ALWAYS WEREWOLF QUEEN!"
Finn says: "Rad!"
Finn takes a marker out of his pack and draws a face on his finger. Jake also has a face drawn on his finger.
Jake says: "Heh heh heh heh heh."
Finn says: "Jake."
Finn says: "You can just shrink yourself down."
Jake says: "Oh, yeah."
Jake shrinks, but leaves his hand the same size.
Professor Worm says: "And when I finally meet the Werewolf Queen, she will take me on as her royal consort and we will rule in blood!"
Putting his hand in the apple, Finn is talking "through" his finger, pretending to be a worm.
Finn says: "Hey, teach."
Finn says: "Can you talk more about scientific..."
Finn says: "uh..."
Finn says: "stuff and things?"
Professor worm says: "Well..."
Professor worm says: "sure, I could..."
Professor worm says: "if this wasn't a class on THEORETICAL FIGHTONOMICS!"
Finn says: "Ohhh..."
Professor worm says: "Are you even in this class, Mister..."
Professor worm says: "."
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "Wormy..."
Finn says: "uh, Wormy McSquirmy!"
Professor worm says: "Oh!"
Professor worm says: "There you are."
Professor worm says: "W."
Professor worm says: "McSquirmy."
Professor worm says: "I'm sorry."
Professor worm says: "Yes, you're registered and you haven't shown up for a single class!"
The worms all gasp.
Worm says: "Truancy hurts us all, McSquirmy!"
Finn gets a spitball and a paper airplane hurled at his finger.
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Ow!"
Finn says: "Please!"
Finn says: "Where's your compassion?!"
Finn says: "!"
Professor worm says: "Let's kill 'im!!"
The worms attack.
Worms says: "ASSAIL!!"
Finn gasps.
Worm with glasses says: "Excelsior!"
Finn and Jake proceed to fight the worms. The worms all bite Finn's hand and Finn yells in pain.
Finn says: "Jake, let's get outta here!"
Finn says: "Well..."
Finn says: "that's it."
Finn says: "I'm all outta ideas on how to learn this junk."
Jake says: "OH!"
Jake says: "Let's just solve this thing with magic!"
Finn says: "No..."
Finn says: "That's the easy way out."
Jake says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "It's the easy way out!"
Finn says: "Oh!"
Finn says: "Oh, yeah!"
Finn says: "Let's go visit Choose Goose and his magical shack!"
Scene transition to Choose Goose's magic hut.
Choose Goose says: "Magic, you say?!"
Choose Goose says: "!"
Finn says: "Yeah, Choose Goose!"
Finn says: "I need magic!"
Finn says: "Some kind of mind-enhancing magic."
Choose Goose says: "Ah, yes, the quest you are on, requires  the Glasses of Nerdicon!"
Finn and Jake gasp in awe.
Finn says: "So..."
Finn says: "I just put those on, and then I'd be able to give that lecture..."
Finn says: "and Princess Bubblegum will totally dig it."
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Whadaya want for it, CG?"
Choose Goose says: "Lately, I've been feeling drained."
Choose Goose says: "I only wish to be entertained."
Choose Goose says: "Well done!"
Choose Goose says: "The glasses, you have won!"
Finn makes a big gasp. The camera zooms in quickly on Finn's skin until his individual skin cells are visible. Soon, his molecules and then atoms are viewed. The zoom transitions into outer space where galaxies are visible. The camera zooms in on the milky way, then the solar system, then Earth, then Ooo, then back to Finn, who completes his gasp.
Finn says: "Everything small is just a small version of something big!!"
Finn says: "I understand everything!!"
Jake says: "Whoa, bud, are you okay?"
Finn says: "Oh, Jake..."
Finn says: "I'm better than okay."
Finn says: "I know exactly how to impress the princess."
Jake says: "More spit bubbles?"
Finn says: "No."
Finn says: "No."
Finn says: "Those spit bubbles were as fragile as my old perception of reality."
Finn says: "But wait!"
Finn says: "Maybe you're on to something!"
Finn says: "I could show the princess bubbles the likes of which no one has ever seen!!"
Jake says: "And how will you do that?"
Finn says: "I'll start with a solid bulleted list!"
Two bullet points appear. The Adventure Time logo spins onto the screen and lands next to the bullet points. The scene shifts to the Science Barbecue where the participants are applauding.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Thanks again to Dr."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Dextrose for sharing your fascinating research on the future of cuteness."
Finn says: "Yes, yes, how charming."
Finn says: "What..."
Finn says: "quaint notions."
Dr. Dextrose grumbles angrily about Finn as he walks offstage. "Impudent...".
Princess Bubblegum says: "And now for a special guest lecture by one of Ooo's greatest heroes..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn the Human!"
Finn and Jake take the stage. Jake pushes a cart with a tarp over it.
Finn says: "Ladies and gentlemen..."
Finn says: "and princess..."
Finn says: "I'm here to talk about multi-dimensional bubbles!"
Finn says: "But I'm not just going to talk about blowing bubbles!"
Finn says: "I'm going to blow..."
Finn says: "your..."
Finn says: "minds!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hmm?"
Finn says: "Beyond space!!"
Finn says: "Beyond time!!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "that would mean you've created..."
Finn says: "Yes..."
Finn says: "A BLACK HOLE!!!"
The projection turns into a black hole. Everything starts going towards it. Jake protects everyone as Finn laughs maniacally. Jake grabs Finn and pulls him over.
Princess Bubblegum says: "FINN!!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "DO SOMETHING!!"
Finn says: "It's okay."
Finn says: "I'm sure the solution is on my bulleted—"
Finn says: "Don't worry."
Finn says: "I have everything under control."
Princess Bubblegum says: "UNDER CONTROL?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "MY GUESTS ARE TERRIFIED!!"
Finn says: "YES!!"
Finn says: "AND THEIR BRAINS ARE RELEASING ADRENALINE!"
Finn says: "DOPAMINE!"
Finn says: "EVEN DIMETHYLTRYPTAMINE FROM THE PINEAL GLAND!"
Finn says: "This has serious educational value!!"
Finn says: "Thanatophobia and this NDE is giving us euphoric altered awareness!!"
Finn says: "Don't you see, Princess?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "?"
Finn says: "WE WERE ALL BORN TO DIE!!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL US ALL?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "?"
Finn says: "NO, OF COURSE NOT!"
Finn says: "I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE GREATEST CONFERENCE EVER!!!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "You've gone insane!"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "No way!"
Finn says: "I'm, like, the smartest guy in Ooo, thanks to these glasses!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Glasses?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "take those off."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You're not yourself!"
Finn says: "But—"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Please!!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I need the real you!"
She takes off the glasses. The zoom from earlier is reversed, and the camera eventually comes out of Finn's pants.
Finn says: "What's goin' on?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "WHOA!!!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "You blew it, Finn!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "With this!"
Finn says: "Then I'll kill it..."
Finn says: "with this!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Be careful!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn!!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Look out!!"
Finn stabs the device, turning his sword into a fourth-dimensional object.
Finn says: "Wha?"
Finn says: "Fourth-dimensional!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Let me go!"
Jake says: "Finn!!"
Jake says: "Don't do anything stupid!!"
Finn says: "I can't help it, man!!"
Jake says: "FINN!!!!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "FINN!!!!"
The black hole is suddenly destroyed in a grand explosion. Finn is hurled out without his sword. Jake protects everyone from the explosion while catching Finn at the same time.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "My Science Barbecue was a fiasco..."
All of the audience members suddenly cheer excitedly and enthusiastically. "That was incredible!" "That was the greatest conference ever!" The bulleted list from earlier lands in Princess Bubblegum's hands.
Princess Bubblegum says: "What's this?"
Princess Bubblegum says: ""Make hyper bubble."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Cause black hole."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Become insane."
Princess Bubblegum says: "PB takes off the glasses."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Save the day."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Win the heart of the princess."
Princess Bubblegum says: ""?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn, you knew all this would happen?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Knew what?"
Finn says: "I wrote that list when I was insane with smartness!"
She leans in and kisses Finn on his cheek. Finn blushes and breathes heavily and nervously before fainting. The princess giggles at him as the audience continues to cheer. The episode ends.
