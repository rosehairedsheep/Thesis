Episode opens with Finn sitting at the kitchen table with giant crystal in his arms while searching through a holobook.
Finn says: "Hmm..."
Jake says: "Yo, man, what's going on?"
Finn says: "I found this crystal on our door step, it's pretty mysterious, I'm trying to find information about it using the holobook."
Jake says: "Oo, that's cool, but do you know what's really cool?"
Jake says: "Tough Guy contest!"
Jake says: "Tough Boys!"
Finn says: "Wait man, doesn't this look like Tree Trunks' lipstick?"
Jake visualizes the scenario of Tree Trunks's explosion.
Jake says: "That's impossible, Tree Trunks exploded in the scary dark forest after she ate that Crystal Gem Apple, remember?"
Finn says: "Yeah, I remember."
Jake says: "Come on man!"
Jake says: "Tough Guy contest me!"
Finn says: "Ha!"
Jake says: "you got what it takes to rip-it?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Uh, yeah!"
Jake says: "Then let's get it on!"
The contest begins with Finn breaking a branch over his knee.
Finn says: "Yeah-yo!"
Pan over to Jake who is holding a chaise longue, he brakes it over his knee.
Jake says: "Hee-yah!"
Cue screen Finn's voice "Round Two, baby!".
Finn says: "Noooooo!"
Cue screen Jake's voice "Round Three".
Both Finn & Jake lock hands, trying to best the other. Finn puts Jake in a headlock.
Finn says: "Got you, dude!"
Jake says: "I'm gonna break out!"
Finn says: "No way!"
Jake says: "I was just messing with ya, dude."
Jake says: "Are you okay?"
Jake says: "Oh dangit, Jake  like this..."
Jake says: "like this..."
Flash back to Jake and his brother Jermaine in the forest, both have boxes gloves. Jermaine is face down in the grass while Jake cries over him.
Joshua says: "Jake, what did you do to your brother?"
Jake says: "We were just playin' and then I got out of control!"
Jake says: "I'm sorry, dad."
Joshua says: "Having no self control makes you a tough galoot, like me!"
Jake says: "But I don't want to hurt nobody!"
Joshua says: "Well, that's too bad, kid, 'cause you're going to hurt everybody!"
Jake says: "Noooo!"
The flashback ends, Jake is still holding the cup, his eyes are wide and he is shaking.
Jake says: "I'm never going to hurt anybody, ever, starting..."
Jake says: "now!"
Close up of window as the sun goes down and night comes. Shot of Tree Fort's exteriors as a bird's crowing is heard and the sun comes up.
Finn says: "'Sup, dude?"
Jake says: "Finn, you're okay!"
Jake says: "I was afraid I mashed your potatoes too hard last night."
Finn says: "Ha, you didn't mash my potatoes!"
Finn says: "You didn't even make me cry silently into my pillow last night for- thirty minutes."
Finn says: "In fact, you read to go again tough stuff?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Nope, no more, dude."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "I never wanna lose control again, man!"
Finn says: "You look like a wuss!"
Jake says: "Mmm hmm."
Jake says: "Whoa..."
There is an explosion of bright light and Finn is knocked to the floor. Suddenly a portal appears and three Crystal Guardians step through.
Finn says: "Chip-chap-chop, what's going on?!"
Finn says: "!"
Crystal Guardian #1 says: "Uh, which one of you is Finn the Human?"
Finn says: "It depends on who's asking, are ya'll good or evil?"
Crystal Guardian #1 says: "Uh, we're good."
Crystal Guardian #1 says: "Get him!"
Jake says: "Hey, you guys, put my bro down."
Finn says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake lands face down in the Crystal Dimension. He quickly recovers to see Finn in a large bubble like prison, guarded by a single Guardian.
Finn says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "Hey, man, what happened?"
Finn says: "I don't know, but I'm trapped in this crystal ball, get me out of here!"
Crystal Guardian #3? says: "Halt."
Jake says: "Hey, man, I'm Jake."
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "Beat it!"
Jake says: "I wanna know why you took my buddy and I'm not going to use force to get it out of you."
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "I'm just following orders, bub."
Jake says: "Whose orders?"
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "Um, well, it's a secret but part of it is we're turning Finn into a crystal."
Finn says: "Jake, you can stop these guys now!"
Jake says: "Ah, man!"
Finn says: "get me out of here!"
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "No, you'll look awesome in crystal, like us!"
Jake says: "Can't we work this out like gents?"
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "Get lost!"
Joshua says: "Jake, lose control, flip out on those guys!"
Jake says: "No, dad, I gotta control myself!"
Jake says: "Control, control, control, con-trol."
Jake says: "Whoa, okay okay."
Jake says: "I'm hatching a controlled plan."
Jake says: "Alright, man, move out of the way and let me get my friend."
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "Nope, not doing it."
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "You're going to hurt yourself."
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "Stop it."
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "You're time is running out little dog."
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "Hey, speed it up in there, guys."
Crystal Guardian #1 says: "Okay, turn up the juice, man."
Crystal Guardian #2 says: "Yeah, man."
Finn says: "JAKE, HELP!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "No, Jake, no, don't lose control."

Joshua says: "Why not?"
Joshua says: "Come on!"
Joshua says: "Why not?!"
Joshua says: "!"
Jake says: "No, no punchies!"
Jake says: "I am in control!"
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "Who are you talking to?"
Jake says: "Nobody, man, don't look at me!"
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "Whoa,  did you guys see that?"
Crystal Guardians says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "Okay, intimidate them with controlled attack."
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "Hurry up, guys, I gotta drop a crystal donk."
Crystal Guardian #2 says: "Oh, come on, I don't wanna hear that."
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "Hey, whatever man, I ain't ashamed- whoa, what the?!"
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "!"
Jake says: "Whoooomp psssh, Oooo oooh psssh."
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "Stop it!"
Cue screen "4 minutes later." Jake is still lightly punching the guardian.
Jake says: "I'm not hurting you am I?"
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "No,  you freak!"
Jake says: "Well, there's a lot more where that came from!"
Jake says: "So you best tell me why you're turning Finn into a crystal."
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "Or what, you'll touch me?"
Jake says: "So, help me I will touch you!"
Finn says: "JAKE!"
Finn says: "AHH!"
Finn says: "HELP!!"
Jake says: "Finn, oh no!"
Crystal Guardian #3 says: "cut it out he looks good."
Finn says: "MY BODY!!"
Jake says: "Nooo!"
Jake says: "My bud!!"
Crystal Guardian #2 says: "Ah, let him in, he can't do nothing now."
Jake says: "I'm sorry, Finn, I'm super lame and now..."
Jake says: "you're dead."
Finn says: "I'm not dead, I'm just all crystal stiff."
Jake says: "Oh."
A voice says: "Get your hands off My lover!"
Jake says: "That voice."
Tree Trunks says: "but in this world I am known as Quartzion the Crystal Queen."
Finn says: "Oh my grosh, you're alive!"
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, I'm more than alive, Finn."
Tree Trunks says: "After I ate that Crystal Apple in the scary dark forest, I was transported to this crystal dimension where I become ruler of the crystal men."
Tree Trunks says: "And the crystal men are all in love with me."
All three Crystal Guardians run up to Tree Trunks to profess their love.
Crystal Guardians says: "Love you Quartzion!"
Crystal Guardians says: "Quartzion, I love you!"
Crystal Guardians says: "Quartzion, we love you!"
Tree Trunks says: "Yes, yes I know, but you love..."
Tree Trunks says: "is not enough  I wanted you, Finn, so you could be transformed into my sexy crystal king."
Finn says: "Tree Trunks, you've gone bananas with crystal power!"
Tree Trunks says: "Finn, it's not sexy for a king to call his queen bananas!"
Finn says: "Jake, you totally gotta stop her!"
Jake says: "I'll try man, but I'm still figuring out my bizz,  Taste my gentle rubs!"
Tree Trunks says: "Whoa there, don't you put your junk on my trunk!"
Finn says: "Go, Jake, go!"
Jake says: "She's too sassy and powerful!"
Joshua says: "Jake, Jake, I brought someone here to see you, it's your brother."
Jake says: "Jermaine?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Are you dead?"
Jermaine says: "Nah man, we're just dreamin' at the same time."
Jake says: "Oh, I'm sorry about that time I beat you up."
Jermaine says: "That was an accident, I knew you were just horsin' off!"
Jake says: "But dad, you said I was going to hurt everybody!"
Joshua says: "Yeah, every-bod-y."
Jake says: "I don't know, dad, that doesn't really help me."
Joshua says: "Everybody who is evil, Jake."
Joshua says: "Let me finish next time, hm, yeah?"
Jake says: "Oh, well then I'm over it then!"
Finn says: "Jake, kick Tree Trunks in the tummy, shes probably still got that crystal gem inside her!"
Jake says: "That must be giving her all her powers!"
Tree Trunks says: "Marry me, Finn, we can snuggle through time and space and kiss each other in an alternate dimensional place."
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, dear."
Jake says: "TT, you're back."
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, Jake, I was behaving so inappropriately I'm so embarrassed."
Jake says: "Oh shush, Tree Trunks, if I had a penny for every time someone went crazy hopped up on magic energy..."
Jake says: "I'd be Abraham Lincoln!"
Finn says: "Tree Trunks, you're okay!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Tree Trunks says: "Finn!"
Finn says: "I'm okay toooo!"
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, Finn, I was trapped here for so long and all I could think about was you and how your so nice to me and I, and I just wanted to say..."
Tree Trunks says: "I think..."
Tree Trunks says: "you're cute and I like you."
Finn says: "Okay, okay, let's go."
Tree Trunks says: "Finn, when we get home, it's apple pie time."
Finn says: "Ooooh!!"
