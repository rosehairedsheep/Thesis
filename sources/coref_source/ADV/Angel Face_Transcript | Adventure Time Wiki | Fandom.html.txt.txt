BMO says: "Dance, parsley."
BMO says: "Face bread."
BMO says: "Special sentient sandwich."
Jake says: "Mmm..."
Jake says: "Is that special sentient sammich?"
BMO says: "Bingo."
BMO says: "Made by the BMO."
Jake says: "BMO, you're my little cherub."
Jake says: "You know that?"
Jake says: "You made all this for me, right?"
Jake says: "Aaahhh."
BMO says: "Not so fast, Jake!"
Jake says: "Naaaw."
BMO says: "The sammiches are yours..."
BMO says: "For a price."
Jake says: "What?"
BMO says: "I need you to be my tiny horse for the day, so I can do my live-action cowboy role-play adventure."
Jake says: "No way."
Jake says: "Poo deal."
Jake says: "I'll do 20 minutes."
BMO says: "It took me over six hours to prepare this nosh, Jake!"
BMO says: "Not to mention the time it took acquiring the ingredients through the "special market," putting my safety and my reputation on the line."
Jake says: "Okay, fine, fine."
Jake says: "Three sammiches for every hour I'm a horse."
BMO says: "Mm..."
BMO says: "One sammich per horse-hour, six-hour minimum."
Jake says: "Deal."
BMO says: "Yippee-ki-yay!"
Jake says: "Om!"
Jake says: "Mm."
Jake says: "Oh, yeah."
Jake says: "It tastes alive."
BMO says: "Steed yourself, partner."
Jake says: "Okay."
Jake says: "Om."
Jake says: "'Kay."
BMO says: "Oh, come on, man."
BMO says: "You didn't even try."
Jake says: "I did try."
Jake says: "Horses are hard."
Jake says: "How's that?"
BMO says: "Eh, it reads."
BMO says: "Steady, girl."
Jake says: "Wha..."
BMO says: "Shh, shh, shh."
BMO says: "I'm going to mount you now."
BMO says: "Hup!"
BMO says: "Good girl."
Jake says: "So, what's the plan anyway, BMO?"
BMO says: "The plan is to punch the toads to the stump and bring justice to the peeps!"
Jake says: "Ow."
BMO says: "Oh, and by the way, Jake, from now on, you can call me..."
BMO says: "Angel Face."
BMO says: "Hyah!"
Jake says: "Yow!"
BMO says: "I used to be a guy who ran from Glob with the wind at my back and the devil on my shoulder."
BMO says: "Now I'm the guy chasing those guys, yet the devil is still here, sleeping in my couch."
Jake says: "BMO, that hurt when you dug your boots into my side belly."
Jake says: "Are you gonna apologize or..."
BMO says: "Horses do not talk."
BMO says: "Over there!"
BMO says: "Hyah!"
BMO says: "Whoa!"
BMO says: "Jackrabbit Johnson."
BMO says: "This guy's wanted for stealing piglets from their mothers while they are feeding."
BMO says: "Makes me sick."
BMO says: "He was last seen in dead goat gulch."
BMO says: "What do you say, girl?"
BMO says: "Want to catch this donkey and split the reward?"
Jake says: "You have 45 minutes left before my next sammich."
BMO says: "Time's a-wasting!"
Jake says: "Hyee!"
BMO says: "Hmm."
Jake says: "BMO, I'm tired."
BMO says: "Looks like my horse needs a rest."
BMO says: "Slow down, horse."
BMO says: "Be careful, Jake."
BMO says: "This is where Jackrabbit Johnson's gang of lowlife bandits lays low."
BMO says: "Hyah!"
BMO says: "Bang!"
BMO says: "Bang!"
BMO says: "Put them up, partner!"
BMO says: "Hyah!"
BMO says: "Pyew, pyew!"
BMO says: "Pyew, pyew, pyew!"
BMO says: "I want answers!"
BMO says: "You can't do this to us!"
BMO says: "No answers, eh?"
BMO says: "No use to me!"
BMO says: "How about you, frisco?"
BMO says: "I'm not going to talk."
BMO says: "Why am I talking to you then?!"
BMO says: "!"
BMO says: "Hooah!"
BMO says: "Yah!"
BMO says: "Unh!"
Neptr says: "BMO, what did you do?"
BMO says: "It's Jackrabbit Johnson's right-hand man, Tumbleweed Terk."
Neptr says: "I spent the last three months building all of this."
Jake says: "Oh, that's where you been?"
Neptr says: "Mm-hmm."
Neptr says: "BMO gave me a Finn Cake."
BMO says: "Don't talk to my horse, Tumbleweed."
Neptr says: "Aah."
BMO says: "Where is Jackrabbit Johnson?!"
BMO says: "!"
BMO says: "I know you know where he's headed."
Neptr says: "I don't know!"
Neptr says: "Tumbleweed terk's always the last to know."
Neptr says: "It's just like I told the other bounty hunter, I swear."
BMO says: "I don't believe a word you say."
BMO says: "Now take a message to your compadre."
BMO says: "Tell him his pal, Angel Face, is itching to get together."
BMO says: "Tell Jackrabbit Johnson to meet me at Dirtwater Flats, just like the old days!"
Neptr says: "Okay."
BMO says: "Sock citizens of dead goat gulch, we can rebuild!"
Jake says: "Neigh!"
Me-Mow says: "Grrr."
BMO says: "Uhh..."
BMO says: "I don't remember where Dirtwater Flat is."
BMO says: "Better stop for the night."
BMO says: "We can make a campfire here."
BMO says: "And we will talk about what we will do with the reward money."
Jake says: "No."
Jake says: "It's been fun, BMO, but it's time to go home because there are no more sandwiches."
BMO says: "But I want to finish the adventure."
Jake says: "Which direction is the house?"
BMO says: "I'm not sure."
BMO says: "Get down!"
Me-Mow says: "Getting kicked out of the guild of assassins..."
Me-Mow says: "check."
Me-Mow says: "Capturing my first bounty..."
Me-Mow says: "Check."
Me-Mow says: "Going to Finn and Jake's treehouse and getting revenge..."
Me-Mow says: "Unchecked."
Finn says: "Finn and Jake's treehouse?"
Me-Mow says: "Mm-hmm."
Finn says: "Who are you, and why do you want to get revenge?"
Me-Mow says: "I..."
Me-Mow says: "Am..."
Me-Mow says: "Me-Mow!"
Finn says: "Me-Mow?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Whoa."
Finn says: "You've gotten bigger."
Me-Mow says: "Have we met before?"
Jake says: "Finn, is that you?"
BMO says: "That's Jackrabbit Johnson!"
Me-Mow says: "Finn?"
Me-Mow says: "It is Finn!"
Me-Mow says: "Tricked again!"
Jake says: "Look..."
Jake says: "It's me-mow, BMO."
BMO says: "I don't care."
BMO says: "That's my bounty!"
BMO says: "Yaah!"
BMO says: "Jake, transform..."
BMO says: "Horse!"
Jake says: "Whoa, did you have a real gun all this time?"
BMO says: "I am old enough to vote."
Me-Mow says: "Hey, Jake, if you can hear my internal monologue, I'm going to kill you!"
BMO says: "Your Daisy days are over!"
BMO says: "I am the whaler 'round these parts!"
BMO says: "Huh."
Me-Mow says: "Sounds like you're out of ammo."
BMO says: "No, you heard incorrectly."
BMO says: "Bang, bang, bang!"
Me-Mow says: "I'm coming for you!"
Me-Mow says: "Ugh!"
Me-Mow says: "Blast you, Finn and Jake and Angel Face."
Me-Mow says: "This prison cell's not going to hold me."
Finn says: "Oh?"
Me-Mow says: "Hey, Finn and Jake!"
Me-Mow says: "I'll get my revenge!"
Me-Mow says: "You hear me?!"
Me-Mow says: "!"
Me-Mow says: "Revenge!"
Finn says: "Hey, BMO, are you sure you took down all the wanted posters?"
BMO says: "Yes."

BMO says: "This bounty belongs to me!"
BMO says: "Get out of here!"
Armadillo says: "Yaah!"
