Jake says: "Everything burrito!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Come on!"
Finn says: "Get ready!"
Jake says: "Ready!"
Finn says: "Yaaaaah!"
Jake says: "Yaaaaah!"
Finn and Jake leap outside and discover the Cuties.
Cute King says: "Peep!"
Jake says: "So cute!"
Finn says: "Look at their little faces!"
Finn says: "Haha!"
Jake says: "Haha!"
Cute King says: "We're not cute!"
Cute King says: "We're evil,..."
Cute King says: "and we're here to dominate you!"
Finn says: "Get the camera, Jake!"
Jake says: "I can't!"
Jake says: "I'm paralyzed by the cuteness!"
Finn says: "BMO!"
Jake says: "BMO!"
Finn says: "BMO!"
Jake says: "BMO!"
Finn says: "BMO!"
Jake says: "BMO!"
Finn says: "BMO!"
Jake says: "BMO!"

BMO says: "What?"
BMO says: "What?"
BMO says: "What?"
BMO says: "What?"
Finn says: "BMO!"
Jake says: "BMO!"
Finn says: "Get the camera!"
Jake says: "Get the camera!"
BMO says: "BMO is camera!"
Finn and Jake begin taking pictures with the Cuties, and Cute King gets increasingly annoyed.
Cute King says: "Enough!"
Cute King says: "Now..."
Cute King says: "bow down to me, Cute King, and my legion of Cuties!"
BMO takes another picture.
Finn says: "Great shot, BMO!"
Cute King says: "Since you won't take us seriously, we will kill you."
Cute King says: "Until then, enjoy your burrito, Jake."
Jake says: "Huh?"
Cute King chuckles and the Cuties walk away. Jake, inside the fort, gasps, and Finn and BMO run next to the door.
Jake says: "My burrito!"
Finn says: "It's perfectly fine."
Jake says: "No, Finn..."
Jake says: "They probably poisoned it!"
Finn says: "Naaaaawww..."
Jake says: "They knew my name."
Jake says: "They knew about the burrito."
Finn says: "Man, you're letting your brain dial turn your fear volume up."
Finn says: "You'll see."
Finn says: "Those Cuties are nothing but an afternoon's delight."
Scene switches to nighttime. Finn looks at Jake out the window. Jake is holding a shovel and standing next to his burrito's grave. Finn walks to his bed and yawns; he gets under the covers. Suddenly, Jake enters.
Finn says: "Jake?"
Finn says: "What're you doing in my bed?"
Jake says: "Oh, nothing much."
Jake says: "You know, just..."
Jake says: "chillin'."
Finn says: "Wait a second..."
Finn says: "Are you still messed up about those little guys?"
Jake says: "A little."
Finn says: "Look, man, whaddaya say tomorrow morning we go track those little guys down and find out just what their deal is?"
Finn says: "Sound good, buddy?"
Jake says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "Thanks, buddy."
Jake says: "Man, you sound just like Mom sometimes."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Good ol' Mom."
Jake says: "She always knew just what to say."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Goodnight, brudda."
Jake says: "Goodnight."
Jake says: "Finn, wake up, man!"
Finn says: "Wha?"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "I think someone's in the house."
Jake says: "For real, man!"
Jake says: "Shh, listen."
Finn says: "Uh..."
Jake says: "I swear, man!"
Jake says: "I really heard something."
Jake says: "Finn!!"
Finn says: "I heard."
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "Who's out there?"
Finn shines the candle across the room and eventually spots two Cuties carrying Jake's sword, who drop it and quickly crawl away.
Jake says: "What theâ€”"
Jake says: "?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "That's my sword!"
Jake says: "It came from downstairs."
Finn says: "Alright."
Finn says: "That's it."
Jake says: "Where are you going?"
Finn says: "I'm gonna go man-handle those guys's banandles!"
Finn says: "Well, they broke a window, but I don't see any of 'em."
Jake says: "Oh, no."
Jake says: "OH, AWWW, NO!"
Finn says: "Jake, what is it?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Ah, no, wait, it's just a blanket."
Jake says: "I think I left it here this morning."
Voice says: "Jaaaake!"
Voice says: "Fiiiinn!"
Voice says: "This is the voice of your moooom!"
Voice says: "I've come back to tell you how dumb you always aaaare!"
Voice says: "I hate you guys so muuuuch!"
Finn says: "Get 'im, Jake!"
Jake says: "Aaah!"
Jake says: "Aaah!"
The Cutie hisses, making Jake shrink back in terror. Finn chases the Cutie, and it hides in a knothole; Finn grabs it and it starts struggling.
Finn says: "Jake, I got 'im!"
Finn says: "He's freakin' out, man!"
Finn says: "What do I do?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Shake 'im!"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Shake 'im around 'til he stops!"
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "They stopped."
Jake says: "Okay."
Jake says: "Now tell 'im not to talk about our mom!"
Finn says: "How do you even know our mom?"
Cutie's first head says: "We've been watching you."
Cutie's second head says: "Learning your weaknesses."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Why?!"
Finn says: "!"
Cutie's first head says: "For tomorrow morning."
Cutie's second head says: "When our army comes and kills you both."
Cutie's first head says: "You think we're so cute, when actually..."
Cutie's first head says: "we're the opposite of that!!"
Jake says: "Hold 'im!"
Finn tries to keep a grip on the Cutie, but its arm is accidentally yanked off, allowing it to escape with a cackling laugh. Finn holds up the dismembered appendage.
Finn says: "Oh, gross."
Jake says: "Well?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Do you believe me now, Finn?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "I..."
Finn says: "I don't know what to believe anymore."
Jake says: "Well, that's close enough."
Jake says: "Let's start settin' up some barricades!"
Scene switches to the following day. Finn and Jake are sitting behind their barricade holding weapons. Finn is asleep and Jake is anxiously waiting. Suddenly, a bugle in E is heard, and Finn wakes up with a start, accidentally firing an arrow from his crossbow. Finn and Jake look out the window to find the cuties charging forward.
Jake says: "There's gotta be a thousand of 'em!"
Finn says: "Wait."
Finn says: "Jake, look."
The Cuties begin tripping over themselves, falling apart, and exploding among other things until there are none left.
Jake says: "These guys aren't a threat to anyone."
Finn says: "These guys are a threat to themselves."
One Cutie accidentally harms another, and Finn and Jake wince.
Finn says: "Oh, hey, it's what's-his-face!"
Cute King says: "No..."
Cute King says: "My men!"
Cute King says: "Quickly, men!"
Cute King says: "Pick yourselves up before the enemy sees!"
Jake says: "Wanna just smash 'em all?"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "No, man, look."
Finn says: "These guys aren't gonna quit until they win or die,..."
Finn says: "and they're not gonna win, so what if we let 'em win, just this once?"
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "And mess up my stats?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "No."
Finn says: "We'd be winning by helping them to win."
Finn says: "That's a win!"
Finn says: "And then they'll be happy and leave us alone."
Jake says: "Alright."
Finn says: "Yessss!"
Finn says: "Now, let's rally an army so we can look intimidating."
Jake says: "Who're we gonna call?"
Finn says: "All of our friends."
Scene switches to the "battlefield." Jake, Lumpy Space Princess, a duck, BMO, and Cinnamon Bun are all lined up in front of Finn.
Finn says: "My army of friends!"
Finn says: "Today, we will lose this battle, but we will also win it!"
Finn says: "When the enemy charges, crumble like a cookie."
Finn says: "When you feel their puny punches, fade like a flower, and writhe in your own blood!"
BMO says: "But, but..."
BMO says: "how are we to bleed if none of this is real?"
Finn says: "With faith, m'lady..."
Finn says: "and ketchup!"
They cheer again.
Jake says: "Ketchup is delicious and deceiving!"
Finn says: "And hey, guys..."
Finn says: "Let's keep the acting subtle."
Finn says: "Less is more."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "No way."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "First, I'm gonna fall in love with one of those little guys, and then I'm gonna fall out of love, and then, I'm gonna totally fake-die of a fake heart attack!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: ""OH!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "MY HEART!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "MY HEART HURTS BECAUSE I FELL OUT OF LOVE!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "AND NOW I HAVE TO DIE!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "OOOOHHHHH!!!"
Bugle sounds again. The Cuties charge.
Finn says: "Get ready, y'all."
Finn says: "Together, we fall!"
Cinnamon Bun falls over.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Not yet, Cinnamon Bun!"
Cute King charges in a giant suit of his men.
Cute King says: "YAAAAH!"
Finn says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "Whoa."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Whoa."
BMO says: "Whoa."
The suit is revealed to be incredibly small. The Cuties punch Finn.
Finn says: "Oh, no!"
Jake says: "I'm dead."
Cute King says: "Victory..."
Cute King says: "is..."
Cute King says: "OURS!"
Jake says: "BAAAHAHAHAHAHA!"
Jake says: "Ah, I'm sorry, everybody!"
Jake says: "Ah, I couldn't keep it in!"
Jake says: "Hahahaha!"
Cute King says: "No..."
Cute King says: "This is ketchup?!"
Cute King says: "!"
Jake says: "Tastes better than blood."
Jake says: "Or does it?"
Jake says: "Hey, Finn, you think blood tastes better than ketchup?"
Finn says: "Jake."
Finn says: "Look."
Jake says: "Aw, nuts."
Finn says: "Cute King, wait up."
Jake says: "We wanna apologize for being fakers."
Finn says: "We did it to protect you from yourselves."
Cute King says: "It doesn't matter now."
Cute King says: "No one will ever fear our strength."
Finn says: "But strength isn't your strength."
Finn says: "Adorable cuteness is!"
Cute King says: "Can I use it to control others?"
Finn says: "Um..."
Finn says: "yeah, sure!"
Finn says: "Just be righteous about it."
Cute King says: "Show me where to start."
Scene switches to the Ice Kingdom. Ice King, inside his lair, is just lying on his back making fart noises. A knock is heard.
Ice King says: "Huh?"
Ice King says: "Who could that be?"
Cute King says: "I command you to make me a sandwich!"
Ice King says: "What?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Ice King says: "No one commands the Ice King to make no sandwich!"
Cute King says: "What about now?"
Ice King says: "Okay."
The episode ends with Ice King laughing playfully and Cute King laughing deviously before a camera flash ends the scene.
