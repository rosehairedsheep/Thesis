Finn says: "Hey, Jake, what do you think this river is made of?"
Jake says: "Man, I don't even want to know."
Finn says: "Then why'd you put your face in it?"
Jake says: "'Cause I'm the figurehead!"
Finn says: "So then LSP was all, "Get out of my kitchen, Finn"."
Finn says: ""Exactly what part of this forest is your kitchen?"
Finn says: "" I says, and she was all, "I dunno how big is this forest?"
Finn and Jake laugh, and Jake bumps into Breezy.
Breezy says: "Oh!"
Jake says: "Whoops, sorry Breezy."
Jake says: "Didn't see you there."
Breezy says: "That's ok, Jake."
Breezy says: "Your head is surprisingly soft!"
Jake says: "That's my sweet neckroll."
Finn says: "So what are you doing in the river, bee?"
Breezy says: "I'm panning for gold."
Finn says: "Gold?!"
Jake says: "Gold?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "!"
Breezy says: "Gold!"
Finn says: "Are you deckin' out the hive?"
Breezy says: "Don't be silly, Finn."
Breezy says: "It's for Honey Man."
Breezy says: "Hey, would you guys like to help?"
Finn says: "Yes we would!"
Jake says: "Yes we would!"
Jake says: "Hey, Finn, you know what?"
Jake says: "This all panned out pretty good."
Finn says: "Man that joke was..."
Finn says: "Are you impressed by my brilliant nugget?"
Jake says: "Bling!"
The Honey Man pours the gold into the top of his head.
Finn says: "Woah!"
Jake says: "Woah!"
The Honey Man begins spinning and dancing, causing his honey to fly everywhere.
Finn says: "Wow- eewww."
Jake says: "Wow- eewww."
Breezy says: "Yeah, this isn't even the best part!"
The Honey Man continues to dance, and his honey lands on all the plants, making them bloom. The Honey Man then spits a crown into his hands.
Finn says: "Sweet crown, man."
Jake says: "Hmm, I could swear I've seen that crown before."
Finn says: "Jake, we've gotta follow that frog."
Finn says: "Bye, Breezy!"
Finn says: "So what do you think will happen when he puts on that crown?"
Jake says: "Maybe he'll turn into a time vortex."
Finn laughs and pushes back a branch as he walks past. When he lets go, the honey on the leaf flies into the air, lands on a flower, and causes it to bloom.
