The episode begins at the Tree Fort. The camera pans to the bridge linking the living room and attic.
Finn says: "Jake, get ready for a slap in the jowls."
Finn says: "Seriously, though..."
Finn says: "get ready..."
Finn says: "for a day filled with adventure!"
Jake says: "Whoa, really?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Yeah, man!!"
Finn says: "storm clouds?"
Finn says: "I've never seen a knife storm before..."
Finn says: "It's beautiful."
Knives begin falling near Finn; Jake pulls Finn inside before knives can fall on him.
Jake says: "Looks like we're stayin' in today, kid."
Finn says: "Well, what're we gonna do?"
BMO says: "Who wants to play video games??"
Finn says: "BMO!!"
Jake says: "BMO!!"
Jake says: "What's on the menu, BMO?"
BMO says: "I've created a new game called Conversation Parade."
Finn says: "Hah!"
Finn says: "Alright!"
Jake says: "Start it up, BMO!"
BMO says: "What do you think about the stars in the sky?"
Finn says: "'S okay, I guess."
Jake says: "Yeah, they're cool."
BMO says: "That is an interesting response!"
BMO says: "Battery low..."
BMO says: "Shut doooowwwwn..."
Finn says: "Booooo."
Jake says: "BMO, that was weak."
Finn says: "What now?"
Jake says: "Ooh, ooh!"
Jake says: "Dude, I know somethin' totally rockin' we can do!"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Let's use our imaginations, man!"
Finn says: "Barf that!"
Finn says: "Imagination is for turbo nerds who can't handle how kick-butt reality is!"
Finn says: "I'm a kick-butt reality master!!"
Finn says: "I would rather die than be imaginative."
Finn says: "I mean that."
Jake says: "Eh."
Jake says: "Your loss."
Jake says: "Lava on the floor!"
Finn says: "Shut up, man..."
Jake says: "Seriously, man!"
Jake says: "There must be an enchantment on the house or somethin'!"
Finn says: "I'm not playing you child-style games, guy."
Finn says: "Watch and learn as I master..."
Finn says: "reality."
Jake says: "NOOOOO!!"
Finn says: "Ah!"
Finn says: "Ah!"
Finn says: "Ah!"
Finn says: "Ah!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "What the hey-hey?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "I was just playin' around with my imagination..."
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "and then everything got intense."
Finn says: "It's like..."
Finn says: "whatever you imagine becomes real..."
Finn says: "That's bananas!"
Jake says: "Don't imagine blowin' apart my own brain..."
Jake says: "Don't imagine my eyeballs coming alive and flying around with rocket packs..."
Finn says: "Dude!"
Finn says: "Imagine that BMO invented a better video game, and that he has new batteries."
Everything in the room begins to melt.
Finn says: "WHOA!"
Jake says: "WHOA!"
Finn says: "But first stop imagining lava!"
Jake says: "I can't!"
Jake says: "My imagination's too amazing!"
Finn says: "Imagine turning your imagination off!"
Jake says: "I can't, dude..."
Jake says: "but I think I can imagine an imagination turning-off machine..."
Jake says: "that is upstairs, surrounded by a crud-load of traps, ghosts, monsters, and poison fountains, and..."
Jake says: "and..."
Jake says: "girls."
Jake says: "Cute girls, and hamsters."
Finn says: "Can't you make it easier to get to that machine?"
Jake says: "You can't hold this baby back!"
Jake says: "That's bad parenting, mamma!"
Finn says: "Then it's up to me to take your imagination downtown!"
Finn says: "Let's go to the den and suit up!"
Jake says: "Neat!"
Jake says: "Grab that missile."
Finn says: "Okay."
Jake says: "And..."
Jake says: "get that cosmic gauntlet."
Finn says: "Nah."
Finn says: "There's a better one over by the desk."
Finn says: "Ah!"
Finn says: "UNH!"
Finn says: "What did I just hit?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "I'm imagining a wall."
Jake says: "You can just go around it."
Finn says: "Really?"
Finn says: "That's it?"
Finn says: "There isn't any invisible, angry troll or anything?"
Jake says: "Oh, there's one now."
Jake says: "Look out!"
Finn says: "Aah!"
Finn says: "I can feel it on my foot!"
Finn says: "I'll kill you, troll!"
Finn says: "Yah!"
Finn says: "Yah!"
Finn says: "Yah, yah, yah, yah!"
Jake says: "You're kickin' too high!"
Jake says: "He's shorter than you!"
Finn says: "Yah, yah!"
Jake says: "Alright!"
Jake says: "You're gettin' him, man!"
Jake says: "She's comin' back for revenge."
Finn says: "Cram this!"
Finn says: "We gotta book it to your imagination machine!"
Finn says: "Yah!"
Finn leaps out the window into the knife storm.
Jake says: "The knife storm, remember?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Here, man."
Jake says: "Try some."
Finn eats some candy.
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "Try to imagine some kind of steel umbrella over the bridge so..."
Finn says: "we don't get knifed."
Jake says: "Okay!"
Jake says: "It is done."
Finn says: "Haha!"
Finn says: "Ha!"
Finn says: "Hey, you did it, man!"
Riddle Master says: "No, voyagers."
Riddle Master says: "To pass this bridge, you must first pass the test of the riddle."
Finn says: "An imaginary riddle master?"
Jake laughs sillily.
Finn says: "Ask me your riddle, Riddle Master."
Finn says: "I accept your test."
Riddle Master says: "Then brace yourself, fool, for this riddle comes from a mysterious, far-away land."
Finn says: "LAY IT ON ME!!"
Riddle Master says: "Yes, um..."
Riddle Master says: "The riddle, uh..."
Riddle Master says: "It..."
Riddle Master says: "cometh..."
Riddle Master says: "uh..."
Jake says: "I can't imagine a riddle."
Finn says: "Dude, just make it super easy."
Riddle Master says: "THE RIDDLE COMETH!"
Riddle Master says: "Tell me, voyager."
Riddle Master says: "What is simple, and yet also..."
Riddle Master says: "a riddle?"
Finn says: "Man, that riddle sucks."
Riddle Master says: "THAT IS THE WRONG ANSWER!!"
Riddle Master says: "The penalty is..."
Riddle Master says: "DEATH BY SNAKES!!"
Finn says: "YEAH, RIGHT!"
Finn says: "I'VE GOT A MISSILE!!"
Finn launches it and it explodes on the other side of the bridge. Finn and Jake scream in pain.
Jake says: "You exploded the snakes right at us!!"
Finn says: "I can feel them all over my face!"
Finn says: "Imaginary poison coursing through my veins!!"
Jake says: "I'm sorry, brother!"
Jake says: "I'm so sorry!"
Finn says: "Let's just get to your imagination machine and we'll be okay!!"
Jake says: "AAH!"
Jake says: "A big bowl of baby elephants, chainsaws, and doo-doo's flyin' towards us!!"
Jake says: "JUMP, DUDE!!"
Jake says: "The Bazooka Goblin has you in its sights!"
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Don't shoot us with that bazooka!"
Bazooka Goblin laughs.
Finn says: "Don't you do it..."
Bazooka Goblin continues laughing.
Finn says: "DON'T DO IT, MAN!!!"
Bazooka Goblin says: "Hee..."
Bazooka Goblin says: "heehee..."
Bazooka Goblin says: "hee..."
Bazooka Goblin says: "Okay."
Jake says: "YEAH!"
Finn says: "AW, YEAH!"
Finn and Jake laugh and do a celebratory fist bump.
Finn says: "Alright, use your powers or something."
Finn says: "This poison is about to kill me."
Jake says: "Alright."
Jake says: "Goin' up."
Jake says: "Check it."
Jake says: "My imagination-off machine is left of the bed."
Finn says: "Is it clear?"
Jake says: "Yeah, I mean there's a bunch of cute girls..."
Jake says: "but they shouldn't bother you."
Finn fidgets around and mumbles to himself "Ah... where, ah... Where is this, I ca—Ah... man." before finding the machine.
Finn says: "Oh!"
Finn says: "I found the shut-off lever!"
Jake says: "Cool, man!"
Jake says: "What're you laughin' at?"
Finn says: "Alright."
Finn says: "I'm gonna turn it off."
Finn says: "UNH!!"
Finn says: "You said it was clear of danger!!"
Jake says: "Dude..."
Jake says: "I can't see anything..."
Jake says: "I must've imagined..."
Jake says: "an invisible monster!!"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Well, how do I kill it?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "I'm comin', buddy!"
Jake says: "Alright, Invisibo."
Jake says: "Eat a piece of this!"
Jake says: "Hurry, Finn!"
Jake says: "Get to the lever!"
Finn says: "Okay!"
Finn says: "I'm doin' iiiit!!"
Finn says: "Hey, come on."
Finn says: "Wake up, man."
Finn pats Jake a few times.
Jake says: "Hello, Finn."
Jake says: "I am awake and healthy."
Finn says: "Jake..."
Finn says: "what happened to your bombastic personality?"
Jake says: "I do not know what you mean."
Jake says: "I am perfectly bombastic."
Finn says: "Nah, man, nah."
Finn says: "Somethin's wrong."
Finn says: "Tell me something amazing!"
Jake says: "But Finn, I cannot tell you something amazing as there is nothing amazing happening around us that I could describe for you."
Finn says: "Ah, see, man, you suck now!"
Finn says: "Crap, it's your imagination."
Finn says: "You need that thing."
Jake reaches for his viola and plays a continuous G♮.
Finn says: "Jake..."
Finn says: "Stop it, man."
Finn says: "You're just playing one continuous note."
Jake says: "One note is all that is needed."
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Your imagination on-off switch has vanished!"
Jake says: "True."
Jake says: "Doth thou not remember shutting down mine imagination?"
Finn says: "I remembereth."
Jake says: "I am happy that my imagination is gone."
Jake says: "It was purposeless."
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "It was the opposite of that stuff."
Finn says: "I know this now..."
Finn says: "Nothing lame, at least."
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "And there's Jake's imagination switch!"
Suddenly, the Lyre Player enters dancing and singing the Imagination Song.
Finn says: "Now for that switch."
Bellamy Bug says: "Good morrow, sir!"
Bellamy Bug says: "My name is Bellamy Bug!"
Bellamy Bug says: "Would you care for a crotchet doily my daughter made?"
Bellamy Bug says: "She imbued it with her tears."
Bellamy Bug says: "You see, she recently broke up with a gentle dandy."
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "How'd you get in my Imagination Land?!"
Finn says: "!"
Bellamy Bug says: "I don't know, my young fellow!"
Bellamy Bug says: "You tell me."
Bellamy Bug says: "Perhaps I represent your secret desire to be civilized!"
Finn says: "REPRESENT THIS!"
Bellamy says: "Oh!"
Bellamy says: "I say!"
Bellamy says: "Oh!"
Bellamy says: "Ah!"
Bellamy says: "Ouch!"
Bellamy says: "Ah!"
Penguins take Bellamy away.
Finn says: "Haha..."
Finn says: "Penguins..."
Finn says: "Hahahaha!"
Finn says: "Heh, alright."
Jake says: "Aaaah!!"
Jake says: "I can imagine EVERYTHING!!!"
Jake says: "Yugh!"
Finn says: "You okay?"
Jake says: "I think so."
Jake says: "Lemme check."
Jake says: "Mmmm..."
Jake says: "Yup."
Jake says: "She's clothed now."
Jake says: "And hey, man!"
Jake says: "It's clear out now!"
Jake says: "We can go on an adventure!"
Finn says: "I don't know, dude."
Finn says: "I think we got all the adventure we need right here..."
Finn says: "with..."
Finn says: "lava on the floor!"
Jake says: "Huh?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Hahahaha!"
Finn says: "Good dog."
