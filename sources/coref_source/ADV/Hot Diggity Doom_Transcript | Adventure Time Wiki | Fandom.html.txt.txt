Jake says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Hey, what do you think you're doing?"
Finn says: "PB don't let nobody touch her stuff—"
Finn says: "not even me, and I'm cool—"
Finn says: "least of all you, you sauce-tasting Brian-sniffer—"
Finn says: "whoa!"
Finn says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Finn says: "Yeeh!"

King of Ooo says: "Somehow my fault?"
Toronto says: "Pbbt!"
Toronto says: "No way!"
Toronto says: "Okay, look."
Toronto says: "Without your calming presence and selfless leadership, this situation would have been a hundred times worse."
Toronto says: "History will remember you as Ooo's greatest hero."
King of Ooo says: "As always, the voice of reason."
King of Ooo says: "Once again, my saintly nature has compelled me, unthinking, to assume the burdens of others."
King of Ooo says: "But a true justice demands a true accounting."
King of Ooo says: "And truly this is all Bubblegum's fa-aa-aa-ault!"
Rumbling.
King of Ooo says: "Oof!"
King of Ooo says: "Good glob!"
King of Ooo says: "What no-o-o-o-o-w?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Looking good, Peps."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Man, this feels kind of good, right?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's like we're building a whole new kingdom from scratch, only without all my beloved citizens this time..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "and their dull, pleading chicken eyes."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Maybe the King of Ooo could hold down the fort for a little while."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I mean, what's the worst that could happen?"
