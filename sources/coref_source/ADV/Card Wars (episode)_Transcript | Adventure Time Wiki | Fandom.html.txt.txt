The episode begins with Finn eating two sandwiches and drinking from a cup. He then falls asleep. Jake enters with an exaggerated sigh. Finn notices his sighing.
Finn says: "Hey, Jake, what's wrong?"
Finn says: "You look dumpy."
Finn says: "How come?"
Finn says: "Is it because of that metal box?"
Finn says: "Is something sad inside?"
Jake says: "No."
Jake says: "It's nothin'."
Finn says: "There's lots of boxes that have nothing in them, but also, you can put something in the box, and then it won't be empty."
Finn says: "Does that make you feel better?"
Jake says: "Ha ha."
Jake says: "You're a charmer, Finn Human."
Jake says: "No..."
Jake says: "it's..."
Jake says: "well..."
Jake says: "Lady Rainicorn doesn't wanna play the game Card Wars with me."
Jake says: "I always beat 'er..."
Jake says: "so she says, "No more Card Warring."
Finn says: "What's Card Wars?"
Jake says: "It's a fantasy card game that's super complicated and awesome, but—"
Jake says: "well..."
Jake says: "No, it's kinda stupid."
Jake says: "Never mind."
Finn says: "How come you never talked about it before?"
Finn says: "It sounds cool!"
Jake says: "Really?"
Jake says: "Well..."
Jake says: "I thought you'd say it was for nerds who do not know how life is outside of the nerd universe."
Finn says: "It is, man."
Finn says: "But I still totally wanna play it."
Finn says: "So no more moping, okay?"
Jake says: "Thanks, Finn."
Scene transition. The two have drinks and the game in hand. Jake gets rid of dishes on the table and they put they're paraphernalia on it. BMO enters with a skateboard.
Jake says: "Oh, hey, BMO."
Jake says: "You wanna play, too?"
BMO says: "No."
BMO says: "I do not play such games..."
BMO says: "with Jake."
Finn says: "What's that mean?"
Jake says: "Ah, whatever."
Jake says: "Let's play the game."
Finn eats some chips and Jake sets up the board.
Finn says: "So what kinda stakes do we play for?"
Jake says: "How about..."
Jake says: "the loser..."
Jake says: "is a dweeb, and the winner is a cool guy?"
Finn says: "Those are good stakes."
Jake pours soda into the cups in front of him. He begins to add extra ingredients to the one on the left.
Jake says: "Coffee ground, beetle butter, grape jelly, kimchi, and..."
Jake says: "this stuff."
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "You're ruining that pop with weird taste!"
Jake writes "DWEEB" on the left cup and "COOL GUY" on the right one.
Jake says: "We drink when the game is over."
Finn says: "Oh, gross."
Jake says: "Now lemme explain the rules."
[Time card says: "2 HOURS LATER..."
Jake says: "That's basically the basics!"
Jake says: "So once we have our kingdom set up..."
Jake says: "Hey, were you asleep?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "I'll have to explain it all over again!"
Finn says: "Doesn't matter."
Finn says: "Let's just play."
Jake says: "But if you don't know the rules then you're gonna lose in the first couple rounds, like Lady always does!"
Jake says: "And then you'll hate the game, and then you'll hate me, and then..."
Jake says: "and then..."
Finn says: "You think you're gonna win?"
Finn says: "I'm gonna crush you!"
Finn says: "Party-dance-style, dweeb!"
Jake says: "Haha!"
Jake says: "Bring it!"
Finn says: "So..."
Finn says: "how do I get my land on the map?"
Jake says: "Oh..."
Jake says: "you, uh, floop your land cards."
Finn does so, and his land and buildings appear.
Finn says: "Uh..."
Jake says: "Keep those honeys hidden, or I'll get a strategic advantage!"
Finn says: "Oh!"
Finn says: "Hmmm..."
Jake says: "Okay, I go first."
Jake says: "I floop the Silo of Truth!"
The Silo appears and it reveals what cards Finn has in hand.
Finn says: "Hey!!"
Jake says: "Pfff, you got really lame cards."
Jake says: "Hmm."
Jake says: "I'll take the Cerebral Bloodstorm, though."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Okay, now it's the battle phase."
Jake says: "I'm attackin' your schoolhouse with my Husker Knights."
Jake says: "So, what'll you use to defend?"
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "Can my Cool Dog and Ancient Scholar defeat your Husker Knights?"
Jake says: "Of course not!"
Finn says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "Then I floop the Pig."
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "Okay..."
Jake says: "okay, first of all, you don't floop a creature to make it fight."
Jake says: "You activate a creature."
Finn says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "No."
Finn says: "It says I can floop the Pig."
Finn says: "See?"
The Pig is flooped onto the battlefield. It runs past the knights and storm and starts eating Jake's cornfields.
Finn says: "And, since I'm not actually attacking, your Cerebral Bloodstorm only does damage..."
Finn says: "to your own kingdom's troops."
Jake says: "You just wiped out my entire attack!!"
Finn says: "What do you expect if all your power units come from corn?"
Finn says: "Pigs eat corn, dude."
Finn says: "Cornfields stink."
Jake says: "CORNFIELDS ARE AWESOME!"
Jake says: "What makes you think you know so much about Card Wars?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "It's just logic!"
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "Your turn."
Finn says: "Hmm..."
Jake says: "You're supposed to discard a card and pick up a new one first."
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Right."
Jake says: "Look at you."
Jake says: "You're a babe in the woods."
Jake says: "Your beginner's luck ends this round!"
Finn says: "Hmm."
Jake says: "Spirit Tower?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "And the Cave of Solitude?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Now my battle phase begins."
Finn says: "I activate my Ancient Scholar..."
Finn says: "to begin studying."
Finn says: "And I also move my Pig to the Cave of Solitude so he can take a nap."
Jake says: "That's it?"
Jake says: "You're not attacking?"
Finn says: "I'll attack on a different turn."
Jake says: "HA!"
Jake says: "Then the seas have aligned and the five winds waft the smell of victory to my palace doors!"
Jake says: "I cast Field of Nightmares and activate my Legion of Earlings to scare your Pig to death!"
Finn says: "My Pig's in the Cave of Solitude."
Jake says: "Um..."
Jake says: "I cast Teleport—"
Jake says: "to move your Pig to the empty field so I can attack 'im!"
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "wouldn't Teleport only work on your own creatures?"
Jake says: "You're right."
Jake says: "I'm gonna slay that Pig, though!"
Finn says: "How?"
Finn says: "You don't have any creatures that can touch 'im!"
Finn says: "Face it, man."
Finn says: "I'm the cool guy."
Jake says: "Hmm."
Jake says: "Heh heh heh heh..."
Jake says: "I floop the Volcano!"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "That'll destroy your kingdom too, won't it?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Hmm."
Jake says: "Maybe."
Volcano spews lava, killing everything on the board. The Earlings scream as they are burned to death.
Finn says: "Aah!!"
Finn says: "My Pig!!"
Jake says: "My Husker Knights revive!"
Jake says: "And I still have my battle phase!"
Jake says: "Hiding in the Useless Swamp..."
Jake says: "the Immortal Maize Walker!"
Immortal Maize Walker appears on board.
Immortal Maize Walker says: "I LOVE CORN!"
Finn makes a worried noise.
Jake says: "Cornfields give the Immortal Maize Walker triple damage."
With that, the Immortal Maize Walker grows more brightly and shockingly evil-looking.
Finn says: "Uhh..."
Jake says: "I told you cornfields are awesome!"
Jake says: "Your Ancient Scholar and Cool Dog won't survive this time!"
The Immortal Maize Walker and Husker Knights move forward to attack.
Finn says: "Actually, my Ancient Scholar's been studying the Raise the Dead ability."
The Ancient Scholar comes out of the schoolhouse, holding a spellbook.
Jake says: "So what?"
Finn says: "So, my Ancient Scholar raises the dead."
Finn says: "I floop the Pig."
Jake says: "NOOOOO!"
The Pig eats Jake's corn; the Husker Knights collapse.
Finn says: "Look!"
Finn says: "My Tower's doin' a thing!"
The Spirit Tower sends its waves to the Immortal Maize Walker. It appears on Finn's side and is now blue.
Immortal Maize Walker says: "HOMINY, HOMINY, HOMINY!"
Jake says: "YOU GANKED MY SPIRIT WALKER!"
Jake says: "AAAAGH!!!"
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "Maybe we should take a break?"
Jake says: "Your turn."
Finn says: "Huh?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake grows to a monstrous size and threateningly grabs Finn.
Jake says: "YOU PLAY!"
Jake says: "YOU PLAY!"
Finn says: "Oh, zing."
BMO says: "I do not play such games..."
BMO says: "with Jake."
Finn says: "Sorry!"
Finn says: "I gotta use the boy-style room!"
Finn says: "BMO!"
Finn says: "BMO!"
BMO randomly falls onto Finn's shoulder and karate chops him.
BMO says: "BMO chop!"
BMO says: "If this were a real attack, you'd be dead."
Finn says: "BMO!"
Finn says: "Jake's acting banununununus!"
BMO says: "Oh, no!"
BMO says: "Are you winning the game of Card Wars?"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
BMO says: "That's terrible!"
BMO says: "If Jake loses the game, he gets super depressed!"
BMO says: "When I beat him, he wouldn't talk to me for a month!"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "I only played so he wouldn't be bummed!"
BMO says: "Finn, you must take a dive."
Finn says: "Okay, I'll try."
Finn says: "But..."
Finn says: "I'm a Card Wars super Amadeus!"
Jake's strected appendages capture Finn and pull him back to the table.
Jake says: "Play."
Jake says: "The."
Jake says: "Game."
Finn says: "Alright, Jake."
Finn says: "Prepare for my ultimo attack!"
Jake says: "Well..."
Jake says: "I've still got my Wandering Bald Man."
Jake says: "Oh, no."
Finn says: "I activate the Pig—"
Finn says: "to attack your Wandering Bald Man."
Jake says: "Well, that's stupid."
Jake says: "Just attack with the Immortal Maize Walker and get the game over with."
Finn says: "No way!"
Finn says: "You've underestimated me and my Pig all day!"
The Pig goes to the Wandering Bald Man and attacks it.
Finn says: "Please lose."
Finn says: "Please lose!"
The Wandering Bald Man slaps the Pig, but the Pig defeats him. The scene is suddenly in slow motion. Jake discards a card.
Finn says: "Noooo!"
Jake says: "I..."
The Pig gets stuck in the mud and turns yellow.
Jake says: "OHHH-HO!"
Jake says: "Ohhh, oh, yeah!"
Jake says: "Pigs can't leave mud landscapes once they're on them!"
Jake says: "Hahaha!"
Jake says: "The Pig is mine!"
Jake says: "First, I'll play Reclaim Landscape, then I cast Summon Archer Dan!"
Archer Dan appears and destroys Finn's buildings.
Finn says: "Whoa."
Finn says: "Math."
Jake plays the Reaper card and steals the souls of Finn's creatures. The Immortal Maize Walker is orange-red again, the Ancient Scholar is now orange, and the Cool Dog is now green. The three go to Jake's side of the board.
Finn says: "My boys!"
Jake says: "You have no creatures left."
Jake says: "That's the game, boyee!!"
Jake says: "The five winds blow through cornfields once again!"
Jake says: "For the glory of Jakoria!"
Finn says: "Heh."
Finn says: "You got me."
Jake says: "Is it..."
Jake says: "too gross for you, man?"
Finn says: "No, no."
Finn says: "I gotta take what's coming to me."
Finn says: "Hey..."
Finn says: "Not that bad!"
Finn says: "I like it!"
Jake says: "WHAT?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "You want a taste?"
Jake sips it and immediately spits it out.
Jake says: "AW, IT'S GROSS!"
Finn says: "In your face, dweeb!"
Finn comes over to Jake and sips the cup again. Jake sips it again, too. They both laugh. They both continue sipping the "DWEEB" cup. As they do so, BMO enters and just shakes its head at them before the episode ends.
