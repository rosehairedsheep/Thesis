The story begins with Finn climbing a ladder to the top of the Tree Fort while carrying a bag of chips in his right arm. Party music plays in the background.
Finn says: "You got that cooler, buddy?"
Jake says: "Yup!"
Finn says: "Good, 'cause we're gonna need it for this..."
Finn says: "ROOF PARTY!"
Jake says: "Watch this, everybody!"
Jake says: "A cooler!"
Jake says: "With stuff..."
Jake says: "for the thing!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Finn, you always focus an endless amount of energy on everything you do."
Jake says: "What about me?"
Jake says: "What do I focus my energy on, Cinnamon Bun?"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Uh, Jake..."
Cinnamon Bun says: "you don't really focus at all."
Jake is seen stuffing an ice cream cone into a toaster for some reason, distracted.
Jake says: "Huh?"
Cinnamon Bun says: "I said you don't FOCUS AT ALL!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Hey, Finn, do another flip."
Finn says: "YUP!"
Finn says: "YAH!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Hahaha!!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "You're a dynamo, Finn!!"
A stranger comes up behind Finn.
Finn says: "YEAH!!"
Finn says: "I NEVER SLOW DOWN!!"
The stranger touches Finn.
Stranger says: ""Never slow down?"
Finn says: "Whoa."
Finn says: "Dude, can you, like, get offa' me?"
Stranger says: "Do you think your energy could be used to power a huge machine?"
Finn says: "I guess so, man."
Finn says: "Your friend is super weird, dude."
The stranger is shown eating dip with his bare hands and laughing sinisterly.
Jake says: "I thought he was your friend."
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's starting, everyone!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "The celestial alignment!"
Everyone observes the event with awe. Scene shifts to after the party; Finn and Jake are cleaning up. Scene shifts again to Finn and Jake's bedroom where they're getting ready for bed.
Jake says: "Man, I'm sleepy."
Finn says: "Then go to sleep, man!"
Jake is again shown stuffing an ice cream cone into a toaster.
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Oh, yeah, right."
Jake says: "Goodnight, homie."
The stranger is shown outside of the treehouse. Finn is shown sleeping and then is kidnapped by the stranger. Scene shifts to the next morning; a rooster crows. Jake is sleeping and his gut punches him awake.
Jake says: "Hrrnf!!"
Jake says: "Ahh..."
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "Wake up, Finn."
Jake says: "Got a busy day ahead of us."
Jake says: "Finn?"
Jake says: "Hmm."
Jake says: "Hmmmmm."
Jake tries to figure out where Finn could've gone but ends up singing "Where Is Finn?" The scene changes to a dark room; Finn has his hands tied behind his back, his foot is chained to a nail in the ground and his head is covered with a potato sack.
Stranger's voice says: "Welcome, Finn."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "You're that—"
Stranger says: "Yes, the charismatic stranger from last night!"
Stranger says: "Also..."
Stranger says: "the Grand Master of the Gnomes!"
Gnomes says: "Hup!"
Gnomes says: "Hup!"
Gnomes says: "Hup!"
Gnome Ruler says: "And..."
Gnome Ruler says: "ruler of the Beneathaverse!"
Finn says: "'S pretty nice."
Finn says: "Hey, why don't you guys just untie me, and we can pretend this whole thing didn't happen?"
Gnome Ruler says: "Oh, no!"
Gnome Ruler says: "I've been searching all over Ooo for the perfect power source!"
Gnome Ruler says: "A living dynamo!"
Gnome Ruler says: "Something that..."
Gnome Ruler says: "never slows down."
Finn says: "Uh-oh."
Gnome Ruler says: "And last night, I finally found—"
Finn says: "It's me."
Gnome Ruler says: "Yes!!"
Gnome Ruler says: "It's you!!"
Gnome Ruler says: "You will have the great honor of powering the Upturnoverdrive!"
Finn says: "That does what now?"
Gnome Ruler says: "It will flip over the entire world!"
Gnome Ruler says: "Then we'll be the ones on top, buddy!"
Finn says: "THAT'S BIZONKERS!"
Gnome Ruler says: "Yes, but the engineering is very sound."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Gnome Ruler says: "Your energies will be harnessed by our most advanced technology."
Gnome Ruler says: "The Cyclonic Rodentarod!"
Finn says: "Ha!"
Finn says: "You may have captured me..."
Finn says: "Hugh!"
Finn says: "UUUOOOOAAAHH!!"
Scene cuts back to just outside the treehouse; Jake and BMO are sitting near the front door and Jake is eating a sandwich.
Jake says: "Fiiiinn!!"
Jake says: "Hey, man, you're shakin' it all wrong!"
Dancing Beetle says: "But shakin' it's all I know!"
Jake says: "Shhh..."
Jake says: "Let me show you how it's done!"
Jake says: "Aw, yeah!"
Jake says: "Huh-hah!"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Whoo!"
Scene shifts back to the Beneathaverse.
Gnome Ruler says: "Congratulations."
Gnome Ruler says: "You fully charged the Alternator!"
Gnome Ruler says: "Now it's time to power up the Plasma Ball..."
Gnome Ruler says: "with sexy, fun dancing!"
Finn says: "NO!"
Finn says: "STOP!"
Finn says: "NOOOOO!!!!"
Finn says: "WHA!"
Finn says: "AAH!!"

Bugs says: "Chug!"
Bugs says: "Chug!"
Bugs says: "Chug!"
Jake says: "Aaaaah..."
Jake says: "Whoooo!"
Jake says: "Any more grass shakes, Simon?"
Simon says: "All finished."
Jake says: "Finished, huh?"
Jake says: "Little footprints!"
Jake says: "Too small to be Finn's..."
Jake says: "More like a bunch-a'-gnomes-carrying-something footprints!"
Jake notices two Nymphs laughing.
Long-haired Nymph says: "Okay."
Long-haired Nymph says: "I've got a joke."
Long-haired Nymph says: "What did the mermaid..."
Long-haired Nymph says: "sea?"
Long-haired Nymph says: "A movie?"
Short-haired Nymph says: "Wh-..."
Short-haired Nymph says: "What?"
Long-haired Nymph says: "Oh!"
Long-haired Nymph says: "I messed it up!"
Long-haired Nymph says: "But it's still funny, right?"
Jake says: "WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, NO, IT'S NOT!!"
Jake says: "Y'all are horrible at tellin' jokes."
Jake says: "Lemme hitcha with this."
Jake says: "Didya hear about the goblin who got his left arm and left leg cut off?"
Nymphs says: "Um..."
Nymphs says: "no..."
Jake says: "That's okay!"
Jake says: "He's all right now!!"
Jake says: "AH-HAHAHAHA!"
Jake says: "AH-HAHAHA!"
Jake says: "AH-HAHAHAHA!!"
Jake says: "AH-HAHAHA!!"
Scene cuts back to the Beneathaverse. Finn is panting heavily "Oh... hoh..." and sweating; he notices he's trapped in a chair. "Wha?! AAAAH!!".
Gnome Ruler says: "Now..."
Gnome Ruler says: "for the final stage!"
Gnome Ruler says: "The brain machine!!"
Finn says: "NO."
Gnome Ruler says: "YES!"
Gnome Ruler says: "THIS MACHINE WILL SUCK THE ENERGY FROM YOUR THOUGHTS!"
Gnome Ruler says: "..."
Gnome Ruler says: "To start our Upturnoverdrive."
Finn's head is covered with the helmet. Screen turns black.
Gnomes says: "NOOOOO!!!"
Finn drops down and charges towards the Gnomes and punches them in another direction when just then Jake busts in and catches the Gnomes.
Finn says: "Jake?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "?!"
Finn says: "!"
They rush over to each other, embrace, and talk over each other emotionally. Seconds later it's revealed that Finn is still in the chair, and the entirety of the preceding scene was a hallucination. Finn pants and whimpers the chair.
Gnome Ruler says: "Ahahahaha!"
Gnome Ruler says: "It's working!"
Scene cuts to a party in the Cloud Kingdom. Jake is dancing there.
Crowd says: "Jake!"
Crowd says: "Jake!"
Crowd says: "Jake!"
Crowd says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Man this party is nuts!"
Jake says: "How'd I even get up here?!"
Jake says: "!"
Long-haired Nymph says: "You blacked out after laughing so hard at your own jokes."
Short-haired Nymph says: "You were off the hook!"
Long-haired Nymph says: "So we took you to the Cloud Kingdom to party with the Party God."
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Who's the Party God?!"
Jake says: "!"
Party God says: "I am the Party God!"
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "Oh."
Party God says: "Jake..."
Party God says: "you have won my favor for being a completely off-the-hook party dog!"
Jake says: "Hahaha!"
Party God says: "And because your gut waves please me so, I will grant you one wish!"
Party God says: "What do you want most in the world?"
Jake says: ""What do I want most?"
Jake says: ""  FIIINN!!!!"
Jake says: "I was on his trail..."
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "And then I..."
Jake says: "got distracted..."

Jake says: "GAAAH!!"
Jake says: "What's wrong with my brain?!"

Jake says: "HAH-HAH!"
Jake says: "WAAAAHH!!!"
The resulting steam explosion is so powerful that it blasts out of the well. Back down underground, the smoke starts to clear; Finn is searching for Jake, who is panting heavily.
Finn says: "Jake?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "You defeated the Gnomes!!"
Jake says: "I did?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Yeah, man!!"

Finn says: "Yeah, man, I'm fine!!!"
Jake says: "Haha!"

Finn says: "Hahaha, yeah, dog!!"
Jake says: "Let's go eat Cinnamon Bun!"
The episode ends.
