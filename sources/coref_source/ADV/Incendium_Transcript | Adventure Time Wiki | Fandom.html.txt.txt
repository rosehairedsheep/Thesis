At the top of the Tree Fort, Finn watching, Jake eating a watermelon and Princess Bubblegum showing her latest invention.
Princess Bubblegum says: "And so, through my experiments with cloud-seeding, I've invented..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "liquid pyrotechnics."
Fireworks burst, splashing Finn with multi-colored liquid.
Jake says: "That's really cool, PB!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Aw, thanks, puppy."
Jake says: "Isn't it cool, Finn?"
Princess Bubblegum looks at Finn.
Finn says: "Owwww-guh..."
Finn makes an attempt to put his head on her lap, but she pushes him away.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Uh, Finn."
Princess Bubblegum says: "No."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Come on, Finn, don't be weird."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Look, I'll see you guys later."
The pyrotechnics bring rain clouds and thunder as Princess Bubblegum leaves.
Finn becomes heart-broken as rain begins to fall.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Oh."
Later, inside the house.
Jake says: "It's letting up."

Jake says: "BMO, put on a game."
Jake says: "Oh, Finn..."

Jake says: "Finn, I'm going out for a quick..."
Jake says: "."
Jake says: "walk in the woods."
Jake says: "BMO, you look after him with your camera-eyes."

Jake says: "Woman!"

Jake says: "I think I'll die if I go in there."
Flambo says: "Heh, oh yeah."
Flambo casting the Flame Shield; chants and also creates a series of runic symbols. He spits on Jake once the spell is cast, but that was apparently just to spit on him.

Jake says: "BMO-cam on."
Finn says: "Gold-darn you, tear ducts!"

After a pack fire wolves pass by the two Fire Guards, the door opens and Jake and Flambo enter the castle.
Flame Princess looks at the two visitors. The camera zooms out quickly to show the entire throne room.
Jake says: "Dooug."

Then appeared a koala bear inside a box made from Jake's stretchy powers.
Jake says: "Eucalyptus!"
Jake says: "Eucalyptus!"
Flame King says: "I don't like koalas anymore."
Flame King says: "Begone!"
Flame King shifts out of his armor as a flame and goes up.
Jake says: "Dude, don't cry."
Jake says: "Can't help it!"
Jake says: "I'm in love with Bubblegum!"
Jake says: "She's too old for you."
Jake says: "I don't care!"
Jake says: "Come on!"
Jake says: "Flame Princess seems into you."

Jake says: "Whaaaat?!"
Jake says: "!"
Flame King says: "She's an unstoppable force of destruction."
Flame King says: "Ahhhh, nothing a psycho like you can't handle."
Flame King says: "Congratulations!"
Flame King pulls the lever releasing Flame Princess and his body evaporates and his armor starts to float up returning immediately to his throne.
The lamp opens and Flame Princess quickly gets out.
Flame Princess says: "I'm so happy!"
Flame Princess says: "I'm so happy to meet you, Prince."
Flame Princess says: "You're my Prince."
Flame People says: "That's sweet."
Flame People says: "That's so sweet."
Jake says: "She seems normal."
Flame People says: "Yeah, she seems normal."
Flame Princess says: "Stop whispering!"
Flambo says: "Hey, so that's where I came from."
Flame Princess returns to her normal humanoid form.
Jake says: "You know, on second thought,..."
Jake says: "we're not really each other's types."
Flame Princess says: "We're..."
Flame Princess says: "what?"
Jake says: "I changed my mind."
Jake says: "I don't like you."
Flame Princess says: "You..."
Flame Princess says: "WHAT?!"
Flame Princess says: "!"
Fire Castle erupts.
Later, Jake runs above ground and is near the Tree Fort.
Flame Princess is gaining on Jake.
Jake pushes the door and quickly closes it behind him.
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "I really messed up."
Tree Fort shakes and the fire starts spreading.
Jake says: "Finn, buddy, you gotta help me."
Jake says: "I made a mistake."
Fire closing in and Jake and BMO start running.
The flames start burning the two pictures of Princess Bubblegum.
Finn says: "Who lit that fire?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "I'll kill you!"
Tree Fort shakes again and Flame Princess appears climbing the Tree Fort outside the window.
Flame Princess reaches the top of the Tree Fort and Princess Bubblegum's liquid fireworks are near to her flames.
Finn says: "Don't you touch her stuff!!!"
Flame Princess accidentally ignites the rest of Princess Bubblegum's liquid fireworks and the drops from the fireworks hit Flame Princess, dousing out her flames.
Flame Princess is reduced to her normal humanoid form, which surprises Finn.
Finn says: "It's a girl."
Flame Princess is still weakening, briefly passes out and begins to fall. Finn puts Princess Bubblegum's lock of hair on the side of the Tree Fort near the window he broke and catches Flame Princess in his arms.
Finn then goes inside the Tree Fort.
Flame Princess says: "You!"
Flame Princess says: "What's wrong with me, huh?!"
Flame Princess says: "!"
Flame Princess says: "You don't like me?!"
Flame Princess says: "!"
Finn says: "I like you!"
Flame Princess blushes for a few moments.
Flame Princess says: "What's wrong with you?!"
Flame Princess says: "!"
Flame Princess slaps Finn, leaving a hand-shaped burn mark on his face.
Flame Princess says: "Don't ever mess with me again!"
Flame Princess shoots out the window in a trail of fire.
Finn says: "Who was that?"
Jake says: "The Princess of the Fire Kingdom?"
Finn says: "Dude, I think I have a crush."
