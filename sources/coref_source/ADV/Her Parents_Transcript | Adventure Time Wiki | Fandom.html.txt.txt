Jake says: "You want some more eggs, BMO?"
BMO says: "Yes, please."
Jake says: "How 'bout you, Finny?"
Jake says: "Need a refill?"
Finn says: "I'm pretty full, man..."
Finn says: "but lemme see if I can..."
Finn says: "rearrange."
Finn says: "Nope."
Finn says: "Can't do it."
Jake says: "I don't know if stomachs work like that, dude."
Finn says: "Sometimes it helps."
Jake says: "Can't argue with that!"
Jake says: "Ahh..."
Finn says: "Ahh..."
BMO says: "Ahh..."
Telephone rings and Jake groans.
Finn says: "Lady Rainicorn again?"
Jake says: "Yeah, man."
Jake says: "She's worried about introducing me to her parents at lunch today."
Jake says: "She thinks they're gonna freak out."
Finn says: "Um..."
Finn says: "maybe give her parents some treasure?"
Jake says: "No way!"
Jake says: "That's our treasure!"
Jake says: "Wait."
Jake says: "I've got it, dude!"
Jake says: "I'll invite them over early, smooth them over using my personality, and we'll all be best friends before Lady gets here so she doesn't have to feel nervous!"
Jake says: "It's perfect!"
Jake says: "I'll just send them a quick Prism-gram."
Finn says: "What's it say?"
Jake says: "Hold on."
Jake says: "It's still converting the light waves into brain waves."
Jake says: "Ahh..."
Jake says: "They're into it, dude!"
Finn says: "Sweet!"
Finn says: "Let's go powder our noses!"
Scene shifts to Finn and Jake's bedroom.
Finn says: "Why's Lady so nervous, anyway?"
Jake says: "Well..."
Jake says: "she didn't really say, but it might have somethin' to do with the Rainicorn-Dog Wars."
Finn says: "There were wars between rainicorns and dogs?"
Jake says: "Horrifying wars."
Jake says: "For thousands of years, rainicorns battled dogs over territory in the Crystal Dimension..."
Jake says: "but Lady and I are cool."
Finn says: "Dude!"
Finn says: "Her parents are probably all full of dog-hatred from the war-times!"
Finn says: "They're gonna see you're a dog and forbid Lady from ever hanging out with you again!"
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "Nah."
Jake says: "That could never happen."
Finn says: "You didn't think this through enough..."
Finn says: "IT COULD HAPPEN!!"
Jake says: "AAAH!"
Jake says: "I'M A MORON!"
Finn says: "Don't worry."
Finn says: "I've got a plan that's gonna solve this biz."
Finn says: "Homies help homies."
Finn says: "Always."
Jake says: "I'm ready to hear your plan, homie."
Finn whispers to Jake; in the next scene they can be seen painting the treasure room and singing The Decorating Song, while Jake morphs himself into a rainicorn.
Finn says: "Haha, yeah!"
Finn says: "This plan is perfect!"
Jake says: "You know, I thought painting ourselves rainbow-color using condiments and stuff from the fridge so we could pretend to be rainicorns was a good idea when you pitched it to me five minutes ago, but now I'm not so sure, man."
Finn says: "Come ooonnn."
Finn says: "Trust me, homie."
Jake says: "Huh?!"
Jake says: "!"
Ethel says: "Jake?"
Jake says: "AAAAH..."
Jake says: "LET'S HIDE AND BURN THE HOUSE DOWN!"
Bob rings the doorbell two more times, then he and his wife look at each other.
Jake says: "안녕하세요."
Ethel says: "Jake, is that you?"
Jake says: "Uh-huh."
Ethel says: "Are you going to let us in?"
Jake says: "Y-yeeeaaah..."
Ethel says: "AAAAAAHHHH!!!"
Jake says: "I can explain!!"
Jake says: "I can explain!!"
Ethel says: "OOOHHHHH, he's so handsome!"
Ethel says: "Oh, Bob, our daughter's finally found a handsome rainicorn to love!"
Jake says: "You think I'm a rainicorn?"
Bob says: "I think we can spot a member of our own species, Jake."
Bob says: "We're not blind."
Ethel says: "Well, we are a little blind."
Bob says: "Yes, I guess we are a little blind."
Jake says: "Uh, well, hey!"
Jake says: "Come on in!"
Jake says: "It's awesome to finally meet you both!"
Ethel says: "Your house is very colorful."
Ethel says: "I like that!"
Finn says: "Haha!"
Finn says: "The plan is working, homie!"
Bob says: "Jake, what is that thing that's talking?"
Jake says: "Uh..."
Jake says: "that's um..."
Finn says: "I'm Jake's rainicorn roommate!"
Finn says: "Everyone do the traditional rainicorn rain dance!"
Bob says: "Jake, please ask your goblin butler to stop insulting my heritage!"
Jake says: "Uh..."
Jake says: "y-yes!"
Jake says: "Get outta here, goblin!"
Jake says: "Go fetch us some rainicorn snacks!"
Finn says: "But—"
Jake says: "Come on, homie, help me!"
Finn says: "Ha!"
Finn says: "You got it, homie!"
Jake says: "Uh..."
Jake says: "please, c-come upstairs."
Scene shifts to the living room.
Jake says: "My goblin will bring us snacks in a moment."
Bob says: "Thank you, Jake."
Bob says: "I'm glad the wife and I made the trip from the Crystal Dimension."
Ethel says: "Yes, we're eager to know more about the studly young rainicorn that's dating our daughter."
Bob says: "Ethel..."
Jake says: "Well, ask me whatever you like, Ethel, Bob!"
Ethel says: "I am a little curious about your goblin."
Ethel says: "He looks a little odd."
Jake says: "Well..."
Jake says: "he's actually a human."
Ethel says: "Oh, Bob!"
Ethel says: "Our future-son-in-law must be filthy-rich to afford a human butler!"
Bob says: "Shh."
Bob says: "Thank you, Jake, for being interested in our daughter!"
Jake says: "Uh..."
Jake says: "No problem, Bob!"
Ethel says: "Oh!"
Ethel says: "Let's play some traditional rainicorn games!"
Bob says: "Jake, do you know Cameladabalawabapp?"
Jake says: "Uh, s-say it again?"
Bob says: "Cameladabalawabapp!"
Jake says: "Ohhhh!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Ha!"
Jake says: "Y'all should go first, though."
Bob says: "Hmm."
Bob says: "Bold move letting your opponent move first, Jake."
Bob says: "I respect that."
Bob says: "Very well."
Bob says: "Cameladabalawabapp!!"
Ethel says: "Oh, Bob!"
Bob says: "Haha!"
Bob says: "Your turn, Jake!"
Jake says: "I..."
Finn says: "Snacks!"
Finn says: "Get your snacks!"
Jake says: "Dude!"
Jake says: "I have to show Lady's parents that I have rainbow powers!"
Jake says: "I need homie help!"
Finn says: "Hmm..."
Finn says: "I got a plan, bro-ham."
Finn says: "Just stretch your horn at me, and I'll take care of the rest."
Jake says: "You're the best, homie."
Finn says: "Homies help homies."
Jake says: "Haha!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake stretches his "horn" at Finn. Finn's face begins to turn red from holding his breath. Finn falls over and releases his breath. Ethel and Bob applaud Jake.
Ethel says: "Very unusual color palette, Jake."
Bob says: "Yes."
Bob says: "Subtle."
Jake says: "Whoo!"
Jake says: "Oh, yeah!"
Jake says: "Finn?"
Bob says: "How about we play some more traditional rainicorn games, my boy?"
Jake says: "I, uh..."
Jake says: "Oh."
Jake says: "Um..."
Jake says: "let's do it!"
Bob says: "Let the games begin!"
Ethel says: "Let the games begin!"
Musical montage begins. Bob and Ethel begin flying. Jake "flies" by having Finn carry him.
Jake says: "I'm sorry."
Finn scowls. Next, Ethel, Bob, and Jake wrestle with their horns. Ethel charges into Finn from behind and knocks him down; she and Bob laugh. Finn looks at Jake who just shrugs helplessly. Next, Finn is places on a coiled-up Ethel, who suddenly juts out like a spring, sending Finn flying off into a glass bottle. Bob places Finn on a coiled-up Jake who does the same, reluctantly. Finn falls through the ceiling of the living room in the Tree Fort.
Jake says: "Hey, man."
Jake says: "How's it goin'?"
Finn says: "IT'S "GOING" CRUD-COW!"
Jake says: "I know, I know, I'm sorry."
Jake says: "But they really like me."
Jake says: "Your plan is working perfectly!"
Finn says: "Being poked in the buns and laughed at was not in my plan!"
Finn says: "Not in the plan!"
Jake says: "Look, Finn, you know I got yo back fo'-eva', but right now, you're the only one who can help me."
Jake says: "Come on, homie."
Jake says: "Hey, guys."
Jake says: "You ready to get this game goin' again?"
Ethel says: "Oh, no, we're pooped."
Bob says: "Yeah, we're about ready to break out our picnic basket and dig in!"
Jake says: "Wohhh, no."
Jake says: "You're my guests."
Jake says: "Let me take care of you."
Jake says: "Homie..."
Jake says: "help me cook something, please."
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Okay."
Jake says: "Thanks, Finn."
Jake says: "Okay."
Jake says: "Don't worry about a thing."
Jake says: "Finn'll make a great lunch."
Jake says: "He's a little raw, but he's got great taste."
Bob says: "What?!"
Bob says: "!"
Bob says: "Wow!"
Bob says: "So wealthy, and so generous!"
Ethel says: "Ah!"
Ethel says: "I was hoping!"
Ethel says: "I was afraid to ask!"
Ethel and Bob gather around Finn. Bob rips off Finn's shirt.
Finn says: "WAAAH!"
Finn says: "Jake!!"
Finn says: "I think they wanna eat me!!"
Ethel says: "Of course we do!"
Ethel says: "Jake said you'd "make a great lunch"!"
Finn says: "JAKE!"
Finn says: "COME ON!"
Jake says: "Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man..."
Jake says: "."
Bob bites Finn's stomach.
Finn says: "AAAH!"
Finn says: "Knock it off, Bob!!"
Ethel says: "Don't you touch him!!"
The three continue fighting.
Jake says: "Come on, stop it, guys!"
Jake says: "Come on, y'all, I said stop!"
Ethel says: "You're a dog?"
Jake says: "Yeah, I just..."
Jake says: "Look, I'm sorry about everything."
Jake says: "I was—"
Bob says: "YAAAAAY!"
Bob says: "HA-HEEEY!"
Bob says: "HURRAAAAY!"
Ethel and Bob celebrate by singing "The Lucky Ones," dancing, and hugging Jake.
Jake says: "Uh..."
Jake says: "uh..."
Jake says: "Lady?!"
Jake says: "!"
Lady Rainicorn says: "어, 나도 우리 부모님 때문에 걱정했었어!"
Lady Rainicorn says: "우리 엄마아빠는 개라면 완전 맛이 가거든!"
Lady Rainicorn says: "개가 전쟁터에서 우리 아빠 생명을 구해줬었어!"
Finn says: "What did she say?"
Jake says: "She said she worried that they'd freak out..."
Jake says: "'cause her parents are bananas for dogs!"
Finn says: "J."
Finn says: "J."
Finn says: "FLIP!"
Finn says: "What the zip?!"
Finn says: "!"
Lady hands Finn a photo.
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "She says a dog saved her dad in the war!"
Finn says: "Wow!"
Finn says: "That's flippin' awesome."
Scene shifts to outside the fort. Everyone is having a picnic.
Ethel says: "Finn."
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Wha?"
Ethel says: "Listen, I just want you to know how sorry we are about..."
Ethel says: "trying to eat you."
Bob says: "It's just we thought we'd never get another chance."
Bob says: "We thought humans were extinct."
Finn says: "Oh."
Jake says: "So..."
Jake says: "this isn't human?"
Ethel says: "Oh, no."
Ethel says: "This is soy people!"
Finn says: "Oh."
Ethel says: "I've never tasted real human before, but they say you can't even tell the difference!"
Finn touches his food, which begins to secrete a strange liquid.
Jake says: "Ew..."
Jake says: "Soy?"
Jake says: "FINN, YOU'RE DELICIOUS!"
Finn disconcertedly watches the rest of the group eat. He stares at his food and cautiously puts some of it in his mouth. He smiles and the episode ends.
