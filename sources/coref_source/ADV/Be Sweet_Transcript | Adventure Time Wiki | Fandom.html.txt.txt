The episode opens with a shot of a purple glimmer in the night sky. On the ground, Lumpy Space Princess is warming herself by a fire.
LSP says: "Ugh."
LSP says: "Oh, it is fried chicken!"
A nearby bush rustles. A raccoon pops out.
LSP says: "Oh, my Glob—"
LSP says: "forest creature!"
LSP says: "I'd better eat it real fast!"
The raccoon grabs the chicken and runs off.
LSP says: "What my life has become!"
LSP's cellphone rings. She answers it.
LSP says: "Hello?"
LSP says: "Oh, my Glob!"
At Tree Trunks' house, Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig are getting ready to go out. The doorbell rings.
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, wonderful!"
Tree Trunks says: "Welcome in, LSP."
Tree Trunks says: "Uh, I want to go through—"
LSP says: "This place is so clean and nice!"
Tree Trunks says: "You're so kind."
LSP says: "Do you have a sink?!"
LSP says: "!"
Tree Trunks says: "Uh, there's one in the kitchen, and—"
LSP says: "I'll use the one in the kitchen!"
Tree Trunks says: "I need to tell you all the s—"
LSP says: "Get me a towel!"
Tree Trunks hands her a dish towel.
LSP says: "Help me down!"
Tree Trunks says: "O-okay, I-I really do need to tell you how to care for Sweet P."
Tree Trunks says: "Uh, there's a proper procedure for Sweet P's special tuck-in time."
Tree Trunks says: "You have to be real sweet to him."
Tree Trunks says: "Pat him gently on the head, kiss his cheeks..."
LSP says: "What?"
Tree Trunks says: "..."
Tree Trunks says: "And give him treats."
Tree Trunks says: "Sing to him real, real soft and sweet and touch your forehead to his and think the words, "You are more precious than anything in this world, and I will always, always love you."
Tree Trunks says: "" Then he'll fall asleep and have sweet dreams."
LSP says: "Oh, my Glob, I'll do all that!"
LSP says: "Okay, bye!"
LSP says: "Have a wonderful time!"
LSP says: "Time to get down to the chill-out!"
Sweet P approaches from behind, feet pounding.
LSP says: "What a princess like me deserves."
LSP says: "Aah!"
LSP says: "Don't hurt me!"
Sweet P says: "I'm Sweet P."
LSP says: "I didn't know you were huge."
Sweet P says: "I'm hungry."
LSP says: "Okay, let's check what's in the fridge."
LSP says: "Do you like pizza?"
Sweet P says: "I like pizza."
LSP says: "Get the pizza, Sweet P!"
Sweet P chases it, feet pounding.
LSP says: "It's not black and crunchy like when I throw bread into my campfire."
LSP puts on a record. Mid-tempo music plays.
LSP says: "This music's way better than owls' hoots."
Mid-tempo music continues.
LSP says: "I deserve this."
The raccoon from earlier looks in through the window at LSP.
LSP says: "No!"
LSP says: "You're an animal!"
LSP says: "You can't come inside!"
Mid-tempo music continues.
Sweet P says: "I'm ready to be tucked in now."
Sweet P says: "Hello?"
Sweet P says: "Will you be sweet to me?"
LSP sips apple juice, unable to hear Sweet P over the music.
LSP is taking a bath. She takes out her cellphone and calls Marceline.
Marceline is in the middle of cleaning out her bellybutton. She answers her phone, which wraps itself around her ear.
Marceline says: "Yo!"
LSP says: "Hey, Marcy!"
Marceline says: "LSPita bread, what's up?"
LSP says: "Just chillin' in my awesome bubble bath!"
Marceline says: "Did you break into someone's house again?"
LSP says: "Ugh!"
LSP says: "I have a new life now and a career."
Marceline says: "I didn't know you had any skills."
LSP says: "Success isn't about skills."
LSP says: "It's about being cool."
LSP says: "These people just randomly approached me, like, "Hey, we will totally pay you to hang out in our sick mansion and feed our baby" or whatever."
Marceline says: "Well, good for you, dude."
LSP says: "I mean, I feel like a totally new person now that I'm finally getting what I deserve."
The toilet rumbles and bubbles up.
LSP says: "Oh, my Glob, what is that?!"
LSP says: "!"
The raccoon emerges from the toilet.
LSP says: "Aah!"
Marceline says: "LSP?"
Marceline says: "Mm."
Raccoon says: "LSP."
LSP says: "Huh?"
Raccoon says: "You don't belong here in the world of decent people."
Raccoon says: "You belong in the woods with..."
Raccoon says: "garbage animals!"
LSP says: "Noooooooo!"
Sweet P walks through the Candy Kingdom. Some Candy People are watching a film. Sweet P rips through the screen.
Sweet P says: "Will you be sweet to me?"
The audience boos and shouts, throwing popcorn at Sweet P. Sweet P crouches in the middle of the road. A car runs into his belly. He looks through the windshield.
Sweet P says: "Will you kiss my cheeks?"
The car drives around Sweet P.
Sweet P says: "Will you give me treats?"
The hobo throws a piece of garbage into Sweet P's mouth.
Sweet P breaks through a window into a house. He crawls up to the bed and pulls the blanket up to his chin. He looks at the parents standing next to the bed.
Sweet P says: "Will you be sweet to me?"
The parents scream.
Banana Guards says: "Wee-Ooo!"
Banana Guards says: "Wee-Ooo!"
Banana Guards says: "Wee-Ooo!"
Banana Guards says: "Wee-Ooo!"
Back at Tree Trunks' house, LSP is chasing the raccoon with a plunger.
LSP says: "Agh!"
Raccoon says: "Look what you've done, LSP."
LSP says: "Huh?"
Raccoon says: "You made it gross."
Raccoon says: "Everything you touch turns gross!"
LSP says: "Uh..."
Raccoon says: "Just like you!"
LSP says: "Aah!"
Raccoon says: "You don't really think you deserved any of this, do you?"
Raccoon says: "You're a rat, just a giant rat that wandered into somebody's nice house."
LSP says: "I'm a good person!"
LSP says: "I take care of babies!"
LSP says: "I'm a bad person!"
Raccoon says: "Just accept that you're garbage!"
LSP says: "Hi-yah!"
LSP enters the Candy Kingdom and approaches two Candy People.
LSP says: "Have you seen a big, fat child around here?!"
LSP says: "!"
LSP says: "If only I'd cooked the pizza!"
LSP says: "I could've eaten some, too!"
LSP says: "I'm so stupid!"
Banana Guard says: "Ma'am, you're gonna have to come with us."
LSP says: "Baby Sweet P!"
Banana Guard says: "No!"
The guards dogpile on LSP and bring her into the jailhouse.
LSP says: "I'm not a bad person!"
LSP says: "I'm not a bad person!"
LSP says: "Huh?"
Banana Guard says: "Hey, big baby!"
The guards try to cheer him up by warbling and making faces.
LSP says: "I found you!"
Sweet P says: "LSP!"
They embrace.
LSP says: "Sweet P!"
LSP says: "I'm so sorry!"
LSP says: "I should've been sweet to you!"
LSP says: "Here, okay, um..."
LSP says: "Pat very gently on the head..."
LSP says: "Kiss on both cheeks..."
LSP says: "Mwah!"
LSP says: "Mwah!"
LSP says: "Treat."
Sweet P says: "Mmm!"
LSP says: "Uh, and sing something sweet."
LSP says: "You are more precious than anything in this world, and I will always, always love you."
Sweet P falls asleep and slumps over on LSP.
LSP says: "Aww!"
At Tree Trunks' house, the door creaks open.
Tree Trunks says: "We're ho-o-me!"
Their mouths hang open as they see the house is a complete mess.
LSP says: "Shh!"
LSP says: "He's asleep."
They peek in at Sweet P sleeping in his room. Sweet P's blanket, taped to the wall, covers up the giant hole.
Tree Trunks says: "Why is Sweet P's blanket on the wall—"
Tree Trunks says: "?"
LSP says: "Shh!"
LSP says: "Mr."
LSP says: "and Mrs."
LSP says: "Pig Trunks, I have some good news."
LSP says: "Sweet P has grown so attached to me that it would be cruel for me to leave him, obviously."
LSP says: "So..."
LSP says: "Yes, I will accept the position as your live-in nanny!"
LSP is pushed out the door and Tree Trunks closes it.
LSP says: "Huh?"
Raccoon says: "Partake of the chicken."
LSP says: "Chicken..."
They both munch on the drumstick.
LSP says: "This is good chicken!"
Tree Trunks says: "Maybe we can get, uh, Neptr to sit."
Tree Trunks says: "I don't know."
Sweet P says: "Mama?"
Sweet P says: "I had that dream again—"
Sweet P says: "the one where I'm a comet boy."
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, really?"
Sweet P says: "Yeah, coming back to Ooo over and over, and there was a fake comet, a beard man in a spaceship."
Tree Trunks says: "My, what an imagination..."
Sweet P says: "The comet..."
Sweet P says: "approacheth."
The episode closes on a shot of the same purple glimmer from the beginning, revealing it is a comet.
