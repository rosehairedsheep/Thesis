Bugs, worms, and mollusk are having a dance party. They are being spied on from above by BMO who is looking through telescope on the observation boat.
BMO says: "Aaaaah!!"
The Giant purple bird takes BMO to its nest where loudly chirping chicks await. The bird heaves until BMO who is screaming is dropped into the open beak of a chick. BMO forces its way out only to be pushed repeatedly down by the bird until it appears to be swallowed. Afterward the bird flops over the nest and sleeps.When morning arrives, BMO opens the mouth of the baby chick and climbs out. It runs to the edge of the nest to see the Tree Fort from a distance.
BMO says: "Oh no, it's crazy far."
BMO says: "Okay, now easy does it."
BMO says: "Easy..."
BMO says: "easy..."
Suddenly popping out from beneath the nest...
A worm says: "Hey man itâ€™s safe in here!!"
A worm says: "You can hide in here!!"
A worm says: "Oh, shoot man, uh ooh."
BMO says: "Eeeeeh!"
BMO says: "so, this is the pits."
A bubble appears from an empty cup.
Bubble says: "I hear that, friend."
Bubble says: "Do you mind if I wallow with you a bit?"
Bubble says: "I'm a bubble."
BMO says: "Okay, nothing stopping a bubble."
Bubble says: "Looks like you've given up on things."
Bubble says: "I'm thinking about giving up on things myself."
Bubble says: "I've been lost in this wilderness a long time."
Bubble says: "Maybe you and me can wait here, to get eaten by a carnivore!"
BMO says: "No, Bubble."
BMO says: "I know two heroes who can help you!"
Bubble says: "You do?"
BMO says: "Yes!"
BMO says: "Help me get to my home, and, and we will help you find your home!"
Bubble says: "Your friends sound great!"
BMO says: "They are!"
BMO says: "They are huge!"
Bubble says: "Well then, what are we waiting for?"
BMO says: "Nothing!!"
A snake slithers by as BMO and Bubble walk through the forest.
Bubble says: "Hey, so tell me about your home, BMO."
BMO says: "I live in a tree house  it's really funny."
Bubble says: "Cool."
BMO says: "Yeah!"
BMO says: "What about your home?"
Bubble says: "My home?"
Bubble says: "I think that my home is very large and very beautiful."
Bubble says: "But I can't pin down these memories it..."
Bubble says: "haunts me."
BMO says: "Oops, I wasn't listening to your story."
They enter a clearing full of mushrooms and a loud bang is heard.
Bubble says: "What was that?"
BMO says: "It's a carnivore waiting to eat us."
Bubble says: "Nooo!"
Bubble says: "What's a baby doing in the wilderness?"
BMO says: "He must be lost like us!"
BMO says: "We should take him with us."
BMO says: "Maybe we can help him find his home, too."
BMO says: "What a handsome baby."
BMO says: "Handsome baby."
It is now nighttime as BMO drags the baby by the arm through the forest with Bubble still following.
BMO says: "Bubble, what do you think our baby's name is?"
Bubble says: "How about "Sparkle"?"
BMO says: "No, I think he looks like a "Ricky."
Bubble says: "Hmmm."
BMO says: "Oo, Bubble!"
BMO says: "Ricky!"
BMO says: "Look!"
BMO says: "I have a bad news: the bridge doesn't have guard rails."
Bubble says: "I don't think we should cross it then."
Loud howling and cawing comes from the forest. BMO and Bubble both turn towards the noises.
BMO says: "I don't think we have any choice!"
BMO says: "I really sure there really is a carnivore this time!"
BMO says: "Ricky, you should go first."
BMO says: "Okay, Ricky, slow and steady,  Ricky..."
BMO says: "Ricky?"
BMO says: "Ricky!"
Bubble says: "Ricky!"
BMO says: "Sparkle!"
Bubble says: "Sparkle!"
BMO says: "Oh nooo-o-o-o!"
BMO says: "One second, sweetie!"
BMO says: "Hmm, a deadly water fall!"
Bubble says: "BMO?"
BMO says: "Bubble, you have to save our lives!"
Bubble says: "Eeeeh..."
Bubble says: "maybe I can, hold out this leaf."
The leaf hits a stick which hits a glass bottle which hits a rock that knocks over a tall stump with a bird on it. The stump causes an antlered skull to hit a trunk balanced on another like a see-saw, that launches a bee hive that has enough moment to hit a large boulder that is next to a skeleton dressed in hunting gear, smashing it and firing a gun shot that hits a standing tree trunk and falls into the river next to the waterfall that BMO and the Baby are heading down.
BMO says: "Thank you Bubble!"
BMO says: "I think my batteries are wet."
Morning comes and BMO is dry.
BMO says: "Oooo, good morning everyone, I didn't have any dreams."
They continue through the forest. This time, BMO is dragging the baby by the foot.
Bubble says: "He looks fussy; maybe he's hungry."
BMO says: "My hungry baby, what am I going to do with you?"
BMO says: "Potato."
BMO says: "Eat your potato, Ricky!"
A howl is heard and surprises them.
BMO says: "It's the carnivore!"
BMO says: "Everybody!"
BMO says: "Hide!"
BMO says: "Psst, Ricky!"
BMO says: "Please, hide!"
BMO says: "Oh, Ricky."
BMO says: "Help me out here!"
Mother says: "My baby!"
Mother says: "I was so worried about you, Sparkle!"
Bubble says: "Sparkle..."
BMO says: "No, Ricky!"
BMO says: "No, no no!"
BMO says: "No, no!"
Bubble says: "BMO, that's his mom!"
Bubble says: "Let go!"
In a heavily wooded area, Bubble zooms around making motor noises and comes up to BMO.
Bubble says: "Hey, the path ahead looks pretty clear and there were these..."
Bubble says: "uh, there..."
Bubble says: "BMO, are you okay?"
BMO says: "I am sad, Bubble."
BMO says: "I miss baby Ricky."
BMO says: "I miss him so much already."
BMO says: "And I miss Finn and I miss Jake."
BMO says: "And I got dirt all in my butt circuits!"
BMO says: "And Bubble..."
Bubble says: "Yes, BMO?"
BMO says: "I-I don't think I'm ever going to get home again."
Bubble says: "Don't cry."
Bubble says: "Sparkle is safe now and we did that."
Bubble says: "Thanks to us he's going to grow up and be anything he wants to be: a strapping horse whisperer or a sexy hitman or whatever."
Bubble says: "And things are looking up for us, too; I saw some bugs up ahead who look pretty with it."
Bubble says: "Maybe they can gives us directions or something."
BMO says: "Oh, my gosh!"
BMO says: "Oh oh oh!"
BMO says: "Bubble!"
Bubble says: "What?!"
Bubble says: "!"
BMO says: "I know those guys, Bubble!"
BMO says: "Those are my homeboys, my homeboys, those are my homeboys!"
BMO says: "We are close to my home!"
Bubble says: "Yeeah!"
Bubble says: "Come on, BMO!"
BMO says: "Yeah!!"
BMO says: "Yeeaah!"
The two run across the field towards the Tree Fort.
BMO says: "It's been so long, I can't wait to have some bread-and-butter!"
Finn says: "Jake, is that you at the door?"
Jake says: "Naw, man, I'm in the kitchen making us breakfast."
Finn says: "I call 'not answer the door' then."
Bubble says: "Um hey, so, BMO, since we have a little time, there is something I've been wanting to say."
BMO says: "Hm?"
Bubble says: "I know I might never find my real home."
BMO says: "No, Bubble, that's not true!"
Bubble says: "It is, I know it is, but it's..."
Bubble says: "it's okay, because I realized something, all this time we've been together, BMO, I haven't felt lost, I felt at home."
Bubble says: "And, it's you, BMO, I feel at home with."
Bubble says: "So, I thought- I mean if you feel the same way, I thought we could get married."
Bubble says: "I-I mean..."
BMO says: "I do!"
BMO says: "Oh, I do!"
BMO says: "I do!"
Jake says: "Hey, a bubble!"
Jake says: "Pop!"
BMO says: "Bubble?"
BMO says: "Bubble?"
Finn says: "What's so funny?"
Jake says: "Oh, it's just BMO, he's pretending to be all messed up because his bubble got popped."
Finn says: "Oooh, heh haha, that is pretty funny."
Bubble says: "There, there, BMO, it's okay."
BMO says: "Bubble?"
BMO says: "Is that you?"
BMO says: "I hear you in my head but I don't see you!"
BMO says: "Oh no, have I gone bananas?!"
BMO says: "!"
Bubble says: "No, BMO, it's okay."
Bubble says: "You see, I'm finally free."
BMO says: "I don't understand, Bubble."
Bubble says: "No, not Bubble, Air."
Bubble says: "BMO I'm Air!"
Bubble says: "I've been trapped in that bubble for so long I've forgotten who I am, but now I'm finally home."
BMO says: "Yeaay!!"
BMO says: "Oh, b-but wait, now you don't need me..."
BMO says: "to feel..."
BMO says: "at home."
Bubble/Air says: "Nooo, see that's what's so great."
Bubble/Air says: "Now we can be together forever, BMO, every minute of every day."
Bubble/Air says: "No more privacy, no more quiet, no more alone."
Bubble/Air says: "Every room you ever go in, I'll already be there..."
Bubble/Air says: "waiting..."
Bubble/Air says: "forever and ever, until the end of time."
BMO says: "Yaaaaay!!"
The episode ends.
