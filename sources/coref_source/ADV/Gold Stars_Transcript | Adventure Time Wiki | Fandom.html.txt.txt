The scene begins with The Lich surrounded by fire and wailing spirits. He cackles at the chaos around him.
Tree Trunks says: "Hold on, Sweet Pig Trunks."
Tree Trunks says: "We're coming."
Tree Trunks says: "There, there, Sweet P, it was just a dream."
Sweet P says: "Just a dream."
Mr. Pig says: "That's my brave little boy."
Mr. Pig says: "Now you better get dressed; today's your first day of school!"
In the kitchen Tree Trunks has cooked breakfast. Sweet P receives a pile of eggs cooked sunny-side up, toast, and an apple.
Tree Trunks says: "Now eat up."
Sweet P says: "Yum!"
Mr. Pig says: "That's fuel you're gonna need later to soak up allll the education!"
Sweet P steps outside the house. Surrounding the home are the Banana Guards, three helicopters, and Finn & Jake.
Tree Trunks says: "Golly, it's awful nice of y'all to take Sweet P to school on his first day."
Finn says: "Our pleas', T."
Finn says: "T."
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Yeah, first day of school can be real tough."
Jake says: "We wouldn't want Sweet P freaking out or awakening any latent evil spirits within himself!"
Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig only stare blankly.
Mr. Pig says: "Well, we're gonna miss you, son."
Jake says: "You think he's still secretly evil, that he's still all "Lich-y" in there?"
Finn says: "Mm, not sure."
Jake says: "I don't know, Finn, he just seems so..."
Jake says: "sweet!"
Finn says: "Mm."
Mr. Pig says: "Bye!"
Tree Trunks says: "Bye!"
Sweet P says: "Bye!"
The group continues walking out of the orchard as Sweet P hums to himself.
Finn says: "Fat squirrel in trub!"
Finn says: "Gah!"
Jake says: "Wait, Finn."
Jake says: "Let's just see how this plays out."
Jake says: "Daww!"
Finn says: "Hmm..."
They all arrive at the school. Sweet P is standing on the inside of the school's area. Outside, Finn takes out a notebook and checks a box next to "First day of school.".
Finn says: "Alright, welp, see you later, Sweet P!"
Jake says: "Bye."
Sweet P says: "Bye, Teddy-Man."
Kid 1 says: "Hey, Baby-Man!"
Kid 1 says: "Did your grandma knit your clothes?"
Sweet P says: "Yeah, and she's my mom!"
Kid 1 says: "Why are you laughing, Baby-Man?"
Kid 1 says: "You're not even a real kid!"
Sweet P says: "Huh?!"
Sweet P says: "!"
Kid 1 says: "You're nothing but a big, weird baby-man!"
Kid 1 says: "Baby-Man!"
King of Ooo says: "Let's see what we got here."
King of Ooo says: "Hello there."
King of Ooo says: "Intimidated by those bullies, eh?"
Sweet P says: "Uh, yeah."
King of Ooo says: "What's your name, kid?"
Sweet P says: "Sweet P!"
King of Ooo says: "I'm the one true King of Ooo."
King of Ooo says: "This is my attorney, Toronto."
King of Ooo says: "Sweet P, there are all kinds of education, you know."
Sweet P says: "No?"
King of Ooo says: "Yes, sir, all kinds!"
King of Ooo says: "Such as..."
King of Ooo says: "dancing."
King of Ooo says: "You could blow off this podunk school and get a proper dance education!"
King of Ooo says: "Then you can come back and really show those mean kids and make your parents proud!"
Toronto says: "Hey, King of Ooo!"
King of Ooo says: "Yes, Toronto?"
Toronto says: "You are a certified dance instructor, right?"
Toronto says: "Show the kid the dance you do."
King of Ooo says: "Nooo, that dance is too tough for an amateur!"
Toronto says: "Aw, come on."
Toronto says: "You gotta show the kid."
Toronto says: "It's awesome!"
King of Ooo says: "Yeah, I know it's awesome, but I really don't think the kid is ready."
Toronto says: "Ready?"
King of Ooo says: "I don't think he's tough enough to be ready."
Sweet P says: "I'm tough enough to be ready!"
Toronto says: "See?!"
Toronto says: "!"
Toronto says: "The kid is tough..."
Toronto says: "and ready!"
King of Ooo says: "Aah, I do see it!"
Sweet P says: "Eee!"
King of Ooo says: "You've got a good eye, and you're a good dog!"
Sweet P says: "Ahh!"
King of Ooo says: "Well, we got us a prodigy here."
King of Ooo says: "You're ready for advanced classes."
King of Ooo says: "Hey, you mugs, wanna see some world-class dancing?"
King of Ooo says: "Just turn around!"
Three Candy People have walked out of a Candy Tavern but don't turn around.
Candy Person 1 says: "Ah, leave me alone!"
Candy Person 2 says: "Leave me alone, too."
Candy Person 3 says: "I'm turning around!"
Toronto says: "Teeth!"
King of Ooo says: "Ha, ya did great!"
Toronto says: "You should come back tomorrow, kid, for more dancin' lessons!"
King of Ooo says: "Have a gold star!"
King of Ooo says: "Show that to your parents, kid."
King of Ooo says: "They'll love it!"
King of Ooo says: "But..."
King of Ooo says: "don't tell 'em where you got it, or you'll ruin the surprise."
King of Ooo says: "Just think how proud they'll be at your big, uhh, end-of-the-year recital!"
King of Ooo says: "You understand?"
Toronto says: "Of course Sweet P understands; he's a good boy!"
Sweet P says: "A good boy!"
Back at home the family is eating dinner.
Mr. Pig says: "So, how was school?"
Tree Trunks says: "Yes, how'd ya do?"
Tree Trunks says: "A gold star?!"
Tree Trunks says: "!"
Mr. Pig says: "I'm gonna put this where we can see it every day."
Mr. Pig says: "Thumbs up!"
Tree Trunks says: "Thumbs up!"
Tree Trunks says: "Come on, thumbs up!"
Sweet P says: "Thumbs up!"
Morning arrives and Sweet P is back in town shaking his belly for a crowd of onlookers, who laugh, and as they laugh King of Ooo and Toronto steal their money.
At home, a gold star appears on the fridge.
Another morning, another location, and the act continues, resulting in more stars appearing.
King of Ooo says: "Thumbs up!"
Toronto says: "Thumbs up!"
King of Ooo and Toronto spend their newfound wealth with reckless abandon. They all arrive at the King of Ooo's small shack.
King of Ooo says: "Well, this is our place."
Toronto says: "We'd invite you in, but the place is a mess."
King of Ooo says: "He's right; we're filthy."
King of Ooo says: "Listen, we all need a break."
King of Ooo says: "Go on home, kid, and we'll see you tomorrow!"
Sweet P says: "Mm!"
Back at home, Mr. Pig and Tree Trunks are arm-in-arm.
Tree Trunks says: "Sweet P, uh, we're going on a date."
Tree Trunks says: "You're smart and educated enough to stay at home all by yourself."
Mr. Pig says: "The proof is on the fridge!"
Sweet P says: "Mama and Papa will be so surprised if the refrigerator is all covered with stars when they get back."
Sweet P says: "One more star should do it."
Sweet P says: "I need to find King of Ooo and Toronto to get me that last star."
Walking into town at night, Sweet P arrives at the King of Ooo's shack. Outside, Sweet P can hear them talking to each other.
Toronto says: "I don't know, K."
Toronto says: "O, they've gone rancid."
King of Ooo says: "Horse feathers!"
King of Ooo says: "A lick of gold paint is all it needs!"
King of Ooo says: "Just a couple more garbage stars, eh, Toronto?"
Toronto says: "Mo' stars means mo' dosh!"
King of Ooo says: "Soon we'll have enough scratch to fund my big comeback!"
King of Ooo says: "This kid is great at helping us rob people!"
Toronto says: "And best of all, he doesn't know a thing!"
Toronto says: "Because if he did..."
King of Ooo says: "We'd have to take care of him!"
Toronto says: "We'd have to take care of him!"
Toronto says: "What was that?!"
Toronto says: "!"
King of Ooo says: "Sweet P?"
King of Ooo says: "What did you hear?"
Toronto says: "What does it matter?!"
Toronto says: "!"
Toronto says: "None of it was good!"
King of Ooo says: "We gotta take care of him."
Sweet P says: "Aaa!"
King of Ooo says: "I shouldn't have said that out loud."
King of Ooo says: "Hey, kid!"
King of Ooo says: "Toronto and I talked it over, and we decided that we're not going to  "Take care of you."
Toronto says: "We're going to burn down your orchard!"
Sweet P says: "Nooo!"
King of Ooo says: "Yup, we're gonna burn it down—"
King of Ooo says: "unless..."
Sweet P says: "Unless?"
King of Ooo says: "You leave home and your loving parents and come dance with us forever."
Toronto says: "Forever!"
Sweet P says: "No!"
Sweet P says: "No, no, no, no, no!"
King of Ooo says: "Come on, Sweet P."
King of Ooo says: "The people love you!"
Sweet P says: "They do?"
King of Ooo says: "Well, mostly they love to laugh at you."
King of Ooo says: "I mean, look at yourself."
King of Ooo says: "You're a—"
King of Ooo says: "a—"
King of Ooo says: "a big, weird baby-man!"

Tree Trunks says: "Oh, my, my, where did you get all this bling?"
Sweet P says: "Uhh, my teachers!"
Tree Trunks says: "Wow, how nice of those teachers!"
Sweet P says: "Mm-hmm!"
In the school yard, kids gather and play around as they wait for the bell to ring. The three kids from before are there wearing yellow tops and bottoms. Sweet P arrives, playing with the fat squirrel he saved days before.
Kid 1 says: "Hey, Baby-Man, guess who we are!"
