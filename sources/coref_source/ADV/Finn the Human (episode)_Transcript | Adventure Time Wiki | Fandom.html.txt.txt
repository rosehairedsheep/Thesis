Finn and Jake are pulled into the portal created by the Enchiridion. They hit a floating chunk of land and sit there for a second. Finn looks up to see the Lich bound from rock to rock towards the time room in the apparent center of this dimension.
Finn says: "He's heading for that cube."
Finn says: "Come on, Jake."
Jake says: "Oh, yeah."
The Lich enters the time room from a hole on the side. Finn and Jake bound to the time room and enter to find the Lich laughing next to Prismo. He then disappears.
Finn says: "Whaaaat?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "He's gone!"
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "What happened?!"
Jake says: "!"
Prismo says: "Hey, hey!"
Prismo says: "Did you guys see that?"
Prismo says: "You know that was a ghost wearing a dead guy?"
Prismo says: "That might be the nastiest thing I've ever seen."
Prismo says: "Na-na-na-na-nasty!"
Prismo says: "Nasty jazz!"
Jake says: "Hey, hey!"
Jake says: "Easy, buddy!"
Jake says: "That's our friend Billy!"
Jake says: "He got possessed by the Lich!"
Prismo says: "Oh!"
Prismo says: "Sorry, sorry!"
Prismo says: "I didn't mean nothin' by it!"
Prismo says: "I mean, I have a lot of nasty friends."
Prismo says: "My uncle is nasty."
Prismo says: "I'm basically honorary nasty."
Finn says: "Do you know where he went?"
Finn says: "We have to find our friend."
Prismo says: "Who knows?"
Finn says: "Uh."
Finn says: "Oh."
Prismo says: "Actually, it depends on the wish I granted him."
Finn says: ""Wish"?"
Prismo says: "Yeah, he wished for the extinction of all life and I did it."
Prismo says: "I guess it changed his timeline or something?"
Finn says: "WHAT?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "OH GLOB!"
Jake says: "Whoa, wait a minute."
Jake says: "How can that be if I'm still here kickin' it with my main man, Finn?"
Prismo says: "Oh, that's because you're safe in my time room until you make your wish."
Finn says: "Ohhhh."
Jake says: "Ohhhh."
Jake says: "I wish that life wasn't anymore extinc—"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Wait, Jake."
Finn says: "Don't mess this up."
Finn says: "Think about it: if we wish everything back to normal, the Lich could just jazz it up again."
Jake says: "Oh yeah."
Jake says: "Jazz."
Finn says: "Hmmmm."
Jake says: "Hmmmm."
Finn says: "I got it!"
Finn says: "I wish..."
Finn says: "the Lich..."
Finn says: "never..."
Finn says: "even ever existed!"
