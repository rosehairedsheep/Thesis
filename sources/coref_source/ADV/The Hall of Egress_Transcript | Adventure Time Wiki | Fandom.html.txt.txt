Jake says: "Remember last time we were out this way?"
Jake says: "It was right after you messed things all up with Flame Princess."
Finn says: "Yeah, that sucked."
Finn says: "But then we found the Dungeon Train, remember?"
Finn says: "That was awesome."
Jake says: "No, it wasn't."
Finn says: "Sure it was."
Finn says: "Anyway, Flambo's brother's map says the weird cave should be like, right over..."
Finn says: "Ah!"
Finn says: "It's right here."
Finn says: "Come on, Jake."
Jake says: "Okay, hold on."
Jake says: "Let me get out my sidewalk chalk."
Jake says: "I want to write all over the walls in there."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "You can't use that stuff in here."
Finn says: "This is like an ancient, sacred temple."
The door shuts itself.
Finn says: "Oh, well, now, that's just great."
Finn says: "You don't put traps in the foyer!"
Finn says: "The foyer is a safe space."
Finn says: "Man, not even Jake could smash through this mess."
Finn says: "But maybe there's a back door or something."
Finn says: "Uh oh!"
Finn says: "Options."
Finn says: "Better leave a little trail in case I get lost."
Finn says: "Bread-crumb style."
Finn says: "Plus, for if Jake gets in and tries to track me down."
Finn says: "Too bad I don't still have that sidewalk ch..."
Finn says: "Oh!"
Finn crashes to the floor.
Finn says: "Okay, well, scratch that."
Finn says: "Now I really hope there's another way out."
Finn looks into the upside-down snowman statue made of rocks.
Finn says: "Hall of Egress."
Finn says: "Egress, egress."
Finn says: "What's 'egress' mean?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Exit."
Finn says: "Egress means exit!"
Finn tries yet fails to open the hatch, then Finn smashes the rock from the top of the upside-down snowman statue against it.
Finn says: "Great."
Finn says: "What am I supposed to do now?"
Finn says: "Wait."
Finn says: "Hey."
Finn says: "Hey, I just smashed you."
Finn says: "I..."
Finn says: "Ah..."
Finn says: "Magic door, okay."
Finn says: "Right, but if I..."
Finn says: "Well done, Finn."
Finn says: "You solved the magic door."
Finn says: "That ought to have done it, and..."
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "This door is too tricky for me."
Finn says: "Guess I better give up, right?"
Finn says: "Wrong, wrong!"
Finn says: "Let's try that again."
Finn says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "Smooth like metal."
Finn says: "Floor's smooth too."
Finn says: "What have we here?"
Finn says: "An errant thread!"
Finn says: "Spike trap."
Finn says: "Better head back and regroup."
Finn says: "Fiendish."
Finn says: "Anyway, don't let's do that again."
Finn draws the map of the labyrinth on a paper from his backpack, and marks the location of the spike trap.
Finn says: "And right then straight."
Finn says: "And..."
Finn says: "Hey now."
Finn says: "Hold the phone, there should be a left turn here."
Finn says: "Letters?"
Finn says: "E..."
Finn says: "G..."
Finn says: "'Egress'."
Finn says: "It spells 'egress'."
Finn says: "This way!"
Finn says: "And here's another one, and another..."
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "So, every map I make is wrong."
Finn says: "All the exit signs led to traps."
Finn says: "Plus the braille, the hieroglyphics, and the tape recorder message too."
Finn says: "It's  almost like the maze is trying to tell me something."
Finn says: "Something confusing, whatever!"
Finn says: "Who needs anyway with your stupid signs and messages?"
Finn says: "I'm Finn Mertens, ya heard?"
Finn says: "And I don't need no nothing!"
Finn says: "Watch me."
Finn dashes into the hatch and keeps babbling at the same time.
Finn hears Jake's voice from a distance.
Jake says: "Finn?"
Jake says: "Fi-inn!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Jake, I'm coming!"
Jake says: "Finn?"
Jake says: "Where are ya, buddy?"
Finn pops out from a pile of stones.
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn opens his eyes, then he is relocated to the front of the hatch.
Finn says: "That's a little disappointing."
Finn says: "Still, though."
Finn says: "I'm in the homestretch here."
Finn dashes into the hatch then pops out from the ground again.
Finn says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "There you are."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Sorry to pop up, then disappear again like that."
Jake says: "Again?"
Jake says: "You just got here, son."
Finn says: "I did?"
Finn says: "Shoot, man."
Finn says: "This cave has got me straight scrambled up and down."
Jake says: "What cave?"
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Uh oh."
Finn says: "Well?"
Jake says: "Well, I followed your map, but there's just a bunch of grass here."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Let me see!"
Finn is relocated to the front of the hatch again.
Finn says: "Dang it."
Finn says: "So, yeah."
Finn says: "Everything I did to try to make sense of the maze or to play it safe totally backfired, but when I got fed up, and started just charging in willy-nilly, I was able to get to the end and find you."
Jake says: "And then the whole thing disappeared."
Jake says: "But I wonder how come I don't remember any of it."
Finn says: "I don't know."
Finn says: "I'm just hoping, maybe if I sleep it off, maybe I'll be better in the morning."
Jake says: "Okay, well..."
Jake says: "Good night, buddy."
Finn says: "Thanks, Jake."
Finn says: "Good night."
BMO says: "Are you awake?"
Finn says: "Yes."
BMO says: "Are you gonna open your eyes now?"
Finn says: "Maybe."
BMO says: "Are you scared?"
Finn says: "No."
BMO says: "Then do it."
Finn says: "On three."
BMO says: "One, two, three,..."
Finn says: "One, two, three,..."
Finn is relocated to the front of the hatch again.
Jake says: "So, been almost a month now."
Jake says: "What do you think?"
Jake says: "You wanna try opening 'em?"
Jake says: "It's beautiful day."
Jake says: "Plus, I need someone to tell me if this hat looks cool."
Finn says: "Man I told you."
Finn says: "If I open 'em now, it'll just be the same."
Finn says: "I got to wait till something's different."
Jake says: "Yeah, that makes sense, I guess."
Jake says: "So, um, I got you a little something, a little present."
Finn says: "Wow, thanks man!"
Jake says: "You're really gonna thank me."
Jake says: "Gotcha!"
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "Yeah, you've done it, like, 30 times now."
Finn says: "It's like programmed into your DNA or something."
Jake says: "Well, shoot, man."
Jake says: "If I wanna do it that bad, it must be kinda right, right?"
Jake says: "Look at it from where I'm sitting."
Jake says: "All this funky pizzazz that only you can see, that's like the literal definition of a hallucination, either all that stuff is a dream or like, I'm a dream."
Jake says: "And I ain't no dream, ya heard?"
Finn says: "Yeah, I know, I heard."
Finn says: "It's just that, well..."
BMO says: "Hyah!"
BMO says: "Open up!"
Finn is relocated to the front of the hatch again.
Finn says: "Oh, Jake, I know you mean well, but I guess I got to see this one through on my own."
Finn says: "I'll see you around, buddy."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "What the..."
Finn says: "How long has this been going on?"
Finn says: "Someone's apt to track me down, bread-crumb style, e."
Finn says: "g."
Finn says: "Jake."
Finn says: "Can't let him catch me."
Finn says: "No more threads to follow."
Finn says: "No more egress."
Finn says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "It's cool in here..."
Finn says: "Ain't nothing wrong with that."
Finn says: "Deep too."
Finn says: "That's good."
Finn says: "Ain't nobody gonna be looking for me down."
Finn says: "Ugh!"
Finn says: "Egress!"
Finn says: "Egress!"
Finn says: "Egress!"
Finn says: "Egress!"
BMO's voice says: "Something's different."
Finn removes blindfolds from his eyes.
Princess Bubblegum's voice says: "Hurry, Finn."
Princess Bubblegum's voice says: "At the seashell's center lies, the cornucopia's smallest door."
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "That must have been some cave!"
Finn says: "No comment!"
