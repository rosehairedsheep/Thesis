In the Candy Kingdom, a crowd of Candy People and Party Bears is dancing in front of a stage, on which are Finn, Party Pat, and Rap Bear.
Rap Bear says: "Yo!"
Rap Bear says: "Check, check, one, two!"
Rap Bear says: "Hey!"
Rap Bear says: "I'm Rap Bear!"
Rap Bear says: "I can rap..."
Rap Bear says: "like that."
Rap Bear says: "Ha-ha, I'm back!"
Rap Bear says: "It's a battle of rhymes."
Rap Bear says: "I'm gonna do it this time."
Rap Bear says: "I'm Rap Bear."
Rap Bear says: "My raps are mystical..."
Rap Bear says: "quantum physics!"
Rap Bear says: "Whoo!"
Crowd says: "Whoa!"
Rap Bear says: "Yeah, yeah!"
Jake says: "Boo!"
Jake says: "That was pre-written."
Jake says: "It's so obvious!"
Jake says: "Take him out, Finn!"
Finn says: "Off..."
Starchie says: "Nope."
Finn says: "Off the dome, here we go."
Finn says: "Uh!"
Finn says: "I'm-a start it now."
Finn says: "I'm-a battle now."
Finn says: "We gonna make a rhyme, so I can rap this time."
Finn says: "I rap for millions..."
Finn says: "sesquipedalians."
Starchie says: "Yeah, that was tight."
Finn says: "Whoo!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Rap Bear, what's wrong, man?"
Rap Bear says: "How can I be Rap Bear if I'm not the best?"
Finn says: "No way!"
Finn says: "You are the best!"
Finn says: "Going up against you was a dream come true."
Finn says: "I look up to you, man."
Finn says: "You're like..."
Finn says: "You're like my hero, Rap Bear."
Jake says: "Awesome."
Rap Bear says: "Thank you, Finn."
Party Pat says: "I thought Billy was your hero."
Finn says: "Yeah, but Billy's dead, so..."
Finn says: "Billy."
Flashback begins. Billy is standing on a pile of fallen monsters.
Billy says: "Ha-ha!"
Billy says: "Check out these dummies."
Finn says: "Ha-ha!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "You're awesome Billy!"
Finn says: "Ha-ha!"
Monster says: "You're gonna pay for this, Billy!"
Billy grabs the monster by the face and throws him upward. He jumps up after it, punches it away, then lands with a thud.
Finn says: "Sick."
Flashback ends. Finn walks offstage and away from the crowd.
Party Bear says: "I love rap music, but only when it's good rap."
Woman says: "Finn!"
Woman says: "Finn!"
Woman says: "Finn."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Who dat?"
Woman says: "I'm Canyon, Billy's ex-girlfriend."
Finn says: "Say what?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "That's so weird."
Finn says: "I was just—"
Finn says: "Party Pat was just like—"
Jake says: "What's going on here?"
Jake says: "Who's that?"
Finn says: "This is Billy's ex-girlfriend."
Jake says: "His special Lady?"
Canyon says: "No, his ex-girlfriend."
Jake says: "Oh, man, I'm sorry."
Jake says: "Well, I hope you guys get back together."
Jake says: "Whoo-oop!"
Finn says: "Jake's still in denial about Billy."
Canyon says: "Billy and I broke up four years ago, but I held on to this."
Finn says: "Billy's loincloth!"
Canyon says: "After Billy died, I couldn't keep it in my place anymore."
Canyon says: "I heard you guys were friends, so when I saw your name on the rap battle flyer, I thought it would be cool to bring it to you."
Finn dons the loincloth like a cape.
Finn says: "Thank you, Canyon."
Finn says: "I guess I've been in denial, too."
Finn says: "Have you been back to Billy's crack?"
Canyon says: "No, I can't."
Finn says: "It's time to go see Billy's crack."
Finn and Canyon stand outside Billy's crack.
Canyon says: "Shouldn't Jake be here?"
Finn says: "He needs more time."
Finn says: "This would mess him up too much."
Several Gnomes are seen lying about.
Finn says: "Fairies!"
Finn says: "Oh, they've infested the place!"
Finn says: "Okay, you guys, out!"
Finn says: "This is Billy's crack."
Gnome 1 says: "Billy got aced by the Lich."
Gnome 2 says: "We have dibs on the crack, so beat it!"
Finn says: "I'll dib up your brains if you don't respect the mems of Billy."
Jordan says: "Flimsy threats!"
Jordan says: "Like a tiny blade of grass in a maelstrom, you are."
Jordan says: "That storm is me, Jordan, Lord of the Fairies."
Jordan says: "I ain't afraid of you or this big—"
Finn cuts his pants off.
Jordan says: "You think you can chump me like that?"
Jordan says: "This breeze feels great, doofus!"
Finn cuts his head off.
Jordan's head says: "All right."
Some fairies fly off with his head.
Finn says: "Laters."
Canyon is sitting on Billy's motorcycle.
Finn says: "Um, so, Canyon, why did you and Billy break up?"
Canyon says: "Huh?"
Canyon says: "Oh."
Canyon says: "Well, I loved Billy, and I believed in him, but then Billy stopped believing, and that jammed up our whole deal—"
Canyon says: "being a top-tier, red-belt power couple."
Canyon says: "After a while, all he did was watch movies and play video games."
Canyon says: "Pretty lame, right?"
Canyon says: "So I bailed."
Finn says: "Even heroes have slumps, bro."
Canyon says: "Yeah, I know."
Canyon says: "I heard he was making a comeback, too."
Canyon says: "What a weird world."
Flashback begins. Billy and Canyon are riding on his motorcycle and fighting demons. Billy does a wheelie.
Billy says: "Billy!"
Flashback ends.
Canyon says: "What the—"
Canyon says: "?"
Finn says: "What is it?"
Canyon says: "It looks like Billy's bucket list."
Finn says: "Whoa, let me see!"
Canyon hands it to Finn.
Finn says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "Looks like he got to most of these."
Finn says: "He sure lived a full life."
Finn says: "Okay, here's one."
Finn says: "Wait."
Finn says: ""Tell Finn that thing."
Finn says: "" What the butt is that?"
Canyon says: "I don't know."
Finn says: "Okay, that's gonna bother me forever."
Finn says: "Well—"
Finn says: "well, here's one more."
Finn says: "We should do it for Billy."
Canyon says: "What's that?"
Scene cuts to Finn and Canyon riding Billy's motorcycle through a desert. Finn has to use wrenches to reach the handlebars.
Canyon says: "Are you sure you're okay?"
A giant reptilian monster snaps its teeth at them as they ride past. It chases them, brandishing short swords. It lunges at Canyon, but she ducks under it and punches it away.
Finn says: "Holy shram!"
Finn says: "Whoo!"
They hit a ramp, which launches them into a canyon. They leap from the bike and grab a tree as the bike hits the bottom and explodes. Finn and Canyon look at each other contently. At the bottom of the canyon, Finn and Canyon stand beside the river.
Canyon says: "That was awesome, Finn."
Canyon says: "You know, you remind me of Billy when he was young."
Finn says: "Whoa."
Finn says: "So..."
Finn says: "can I see you sometime?"
Canyon says: "I have a feeling our paths will cross again."
Canyon says: "Take care, Finn."
They fist bump, and she turns to the river. She raises her left hand, parting the water and revealing some steps. She walks down them and is swallowed by the river.
Finn says: "Why the ocean, Billy?!"
Finn says: "!"
Scene cuts to Finn looking out at the ocean. It is revealed that during the scene cut, he took off his shoes, socks, shirt, and pants. He is now wearing nothing but his backpack, hat, grass sword on his wrist, and his red-and-white underwear.
Finn says: "Okay, Finn, don't think about your fear."
Finn says: "Just jump in there like it's no biggie."
Finn says: "Do it for Billy."
Finn says: "For Billy!"
He runs at the ocean in his underwear, screaming, then runs away. He shivers and pants from fright.
Finn says: "I'm afraid."
Finn says: "I'm afraid!"
Finn says: "Oh, dang, here he comes!"
Finn says: "Here comes the Fear Feaster!"
The Fear Feaster comes out of Finn's bellybutton and laughs.
Fear Feaster says: "Way to go, Finn the Coward."
Fear Feaster says: "Still afraid of the ocean, eh?"
Fear Feaster says: "You should just give up!"
Fear Feaster says: "You're not a hero."
Fear Feaster says: "You're a wimp-o!"
Fear Feaster says: "A cringing, cowardly—"
Finn walks down the beach toward a dock.
Fear Feaster says: "Hey, where you going?"
Fear Feaster says: "Fool, I come with."
Fear Feaster says: "Ha-ha!"
Fear Feaster says: "I'm gonna nosh on your insecurities."
Fear Feaster says: "Then I'll—"
Fear Feaster says: "I'll squat on your hopes."
Fear Feaster says: "So now what, little boy?"
Finn breaks a board off the dock.
Fear Feaster says: "Huh?"
Fear Feaster says: "Uh, hey, man, don't do anything stupid."
Fear Feaster says: "Hey!"
Fear Feaster says: "You're too chicken to face your fears with open eyes?"
Fear Feaster says: "This stank is cheating!"
Finn says: "This stank is for Billy."
Fear Feaster says: "No!"
Finn falls backwards into the ocean. He floats for a second, then crosses his eyes and sinks. A whale takes Finn's hat and swims off with it through a circular opening. Finn follows it, but the opening turns out to be the opening to a giant-sized version of Finn's hat. As Finn swims upwards, the giant hat turns and faces Finn. Finn glances back at it, and it suddenly launches toward him.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"
Finn reaches the surface and gasps for air, but the hat comes out of the water, too, supported by a tall pillar of water. Finn is lifted up by the water. He tries to swim away, but he can't move. The whale suddenly swims up the column of water and out the opening of the giant hat. It opens its mouth wide.
Finn says: "For Billy!"
The whale snaps its mouth shut around Finn.
Fear Feaster says: "Wake up."
Fear Feaster says: "Wake up!"
Finn's sword arm raises itself out of the water and slaps Finn.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
The grass sword extends itself.
Fear Feaster says: "No mortal blade can harm—"
As if responding to the Fear Fester's taunt, the sword slices through the Fear Feaster... much to the apparition's big time dismay.
Fear Feaster says: "What?!"
Fear Feaster says: "!"
Finn looks at his sword, stunned, and it retracts itself.
Finn says: "Was that you or me?"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Hey."
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "I—"
Finn says: "I'm doing it!"
Finn says: "I'm not afraid of the ocean anymore!"
Finn says: "I'm doing it, Billy."
Billy says: "Billy!"
A constellation in the form of Billy draws itself in the sky.
Billy says: "You finished my list."
Billy says: "Now I can rest like a great hero."
Billy says: "Thank you, Finn."
Finn says: "You're welcome."
Finn says: "Canyon helped, too."
Billy says: "Tell Canyon I watch her sleep."
Billy says: "Man, love is weird, Finn."
Finn says: "I know."
Finn says: "Is that the thing you wanted to tell me?"
Billy says: "No."
Billy says: "Goodbye."
The constellation disappears.
Finn says: "Wait."
Finn says: "Billy!"
The constellation reappears as quickly as it disappeared.
Billy says: "What?"
Finn says: "What's the thing you wanted to tell me?"
Billy says: "Oh, uh, you must go to the Citadel."
Billy says: "That's where your father is."
Finn says: "Joshua's not alive."
Finn says: "Me and Jake buried him behind the—"
Billy says: "Not Joshua!"
Billy says: "Your other dad."
Billy says: "Dad the Human."
Finn says: "What?"
Billy says: "Your father, Finn."
Billy says: "He's alive."
The constellation disappears as Billy's words echo in Finn's head. The Crystal Citadel is shown floating somewhere in space, and Finn's dad's silhouette is seen trapped in a crystal.
Episode ends.
