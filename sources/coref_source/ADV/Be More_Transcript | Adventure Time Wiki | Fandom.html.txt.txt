Episode starts at Finn and Jake's Tree Fort. BMO climbs into a dark room with assorted objects.
BMO says: "Hello?"
BMO climbs down a ladder to get into the room. He finds a cardboard box and hides underneath it. He starts chuckling. On his screen, a digital hand selects some files. The hand drags the files into an onscreen trash can, deleting them. BMO's screen glitches, and BMO seems woozy. He chuckles and then looks normal. Scene switches to outside of the box. We hear BMO doing the same act once more and then BMO gets out of the box. He still seems dizzy. We see him selecting the file "CORE SYSTEM DRIVES.sys" and then deleting it. The scene shows his face, which turns from a smile into a frown. BMO's screen glitches out wildly as BMO moans. BMO gets up and wanders around for a second, before falling over. The screen is blank.
Finn says: "BMO?"
Scene shows Finn and Jake looking down at something. The image is distorted.
Jake says: "BMO?"
BMO is lying in a bed. BMO wakes up.
Finn says: "BMO, are you okay?"
Jake says: "What did you do?"
BMO says: "It wasn't me."
BMO says: "I didn't do noth- do noth- do nothing."
Finn says: "Come on BMO."
Finn says: "We got to get you to the hospital or whatevs."
BMO says: "No, no."
BMO says: "I am fine."
BMO says: "Really."
BMO says: "Oh, yes."
BMO says: "Okay."
BMO says: "Please take me to get fixed."
BMO says: "I need- need- need- need to get new core system drivers installed."
BMO says: "We can get them at the MO Factory in the Bad Lands, where I was born."
Finn says: "The MO Factory?"
BMO says: "Yeah."
BMO says: "I am programmed with emergency instructions to get there."
BMO says: "Come on!"
BMO says: "There's no- no- no- no- no time to lo- lo- lo- lo- lose."
Scene changes to Bad Lands, just outside the MO Co. BMO is telling Finn and Jake where to go.
BMO says: "Okay."
BMO says: "Now straight down this place."
BMO says: "Okay, now take a right- right- right- right- left up here."
BMO says: "The instructions also say that damaged MOs get a full memory-wipe before repairs."
BMO says: "Don't let on what happened..."
BMO says: "or all the years we've been spent together will vanish like tears in the oven!"
Finn says: "Tears in the oven?"
Finn says: "!"
BMO says: "Yeah, no fooling."
BMO says: "Oh wait, there's more!"
BMO says: "It says here only MOs are allowed in the factory."
BMO says: "Wait what?"
BMO says: "Oh, that's just great."
Jake says: "Hey, hey."
Jake says: "Don't worry buddy."
Jake says: "We're Finn and Jake, remember?"
Jake says: "Or should I say..."
Jake says: "Finn and JMO!"
BMO says: "Wow!"
Finn says: "Hey BMO, check this out, too!"
Finn says: "Meet FMO."
BMO says: "Finn, you're dumb- you're dumb- you're dumb- you're da man!"
BMO says: "This is gonna be a snap!"
Scene changes to inside of the entrance of the MO factory. Finn falls over.
Jake says: "Hello, there."
DMO says: "Greetings, and welcome to MO Co."
DMO says: "I'm DMO."
DMO says: "Please state your business."
Jake says: "Hey there, DMO."
Jake says: "I am JMO."
Finn says: "And I'm FMO!"
DMO says: "Greetings, JMO."
DMO says: "FMO, you look ridiculous."
DMO says: "Are you damaged?"
DMO says: "Are you in need of repair?"
Finn says: "Yes, absolutely."
Finn says: "Thanks, DMO."
Finn says: "I busted my core system drivers, and now I need new ones."
DMO says: "Fantastic."
DMO says: "Okay."
DMO says: "Please get ready for your total personality wipe."
A hole opens in the wall beside DMO and an EMO comes out, twirling a lasso.
Finn says: "Oh, right, right."
Finn says: "Uh, right."
Finn says: "I mean, no."
Finn says: "I'm just here for the..."
Finn says: "nostalgic purposes."
DMO says: "Ah, yes."
DMO says: "47."
DMO says: "3% of MOs eventually return to the factory for assorted sentimental biz."
DMO says: "Please step 100% on the ultra-tram for your complimentary tour."
Finn and Jake step onto the tram. DMO is lowered from his original position, and a chair pops up on the tram, bringing up DMO to the driver seat.
DMO says: "Greetings."
Finn says: "Wup!"
DMO says: "We are now passing over the famous factory floor."
DMO says: "Birthplace of each and every MO."
DMO says: "Behold the gleaming machinery!"
DMO says: "Teeming and wild with the throes of real creation."
DMO says: "From this unlikely chaos emerges every shiny new MO."
Jake says: "But nothing's moving down there."
Jake says: "It's all shut down."
Jake says: "What happened to this place?"
DMO says: "I'm sorry."
DMO says: "I'm just a tram MO."
DMO says: "I'm not programmed to understand that question."
DMO says: "Also, you're just a JMO."
DMO says: "You're not programmed to ask that question."
Jake says: "Uh, what question?"
Jake says: "I'm serious..."
DMO says: "Anyway, MO Co."
DMO says: "was founded over 1,000 years ago."
DMO says: "By Moseph Mastro Giovanni."
DMO says: "A sad and gentle man."
DMO says: "Beloved by only those he built to belove him."
DMO says: "On your left, you'll see the core system driver installation port bay."
BMO says: "Finn!"
BMO says: "Finn!"
BMO says: "That's it!"
BMO says: "That's where the driver ports are!"
Finn says: "I know, I heard!"
Finn jumps off of the tram and into the room along with Jake.
DMO says: "What?!"
DMO says: "!"
DMO says: "Are you crazy?!"
DMO says: "!"
DMO says: "Get back here!"
The room has outlets in the back of the wall. They each correspond to a different MO from AMO-GMO. The B port is covered up.
Jake says: "Hurry, Finn."
Jake says: "I think he's calling the police or somethin'!"
Finn says: "None of these ports fit right!"
Finn says: "E, D, C, where's the B port?!"
Finn says: "!"
Outside of the room where the trams travel, a new tram drives up, carrying four SMOs.
SMO 1 says: "Intruder spotted!"
SMO 1 says: "Prepare to vaporize!"
SMO 1 says: "Vaporize!"
The four SMOs shoot lasers into the room. Finn and Jake jump behind some wreckage to protect themselves.
SMO 1 says: "Cease fire!"
SMO 1 says: "No intruder spotted."
SMO 1 says: "Vaporization complete."
SMO 2 says: "Um, but what if they slipped past us, sir?"
SMO 2 says: "In all the smoke?"
SMO 1 says: "Allllright, everyone."
SMO 1 says: "About face."
SMO 1 says: "Like I said, vaporization complete."
SMO 1 says: "Now let's head back to base."
SMO 1 says: "It's donut o' clock."
Scene changes to a kind of office kitchen. There is a table with chairs, a vending machine, a refrigerator and a microwave.
SMO 3 says: "Man, how about those goofs?"
SMO 3 says: "Tryin' to mess with our drivers?"
SMO 4 says: "Yeah."
SMO 4 says: "You know the world these days."
SMO 4 says: "All goofs."
SMO 1 says: "Hey!"
SMO 1 says: "You toss me one of them 'nuts?"
SMO 1 says: "Ah."
SMO 1 says: "Yeah, hey, speaking of goofs?"
SMO 1 says: "Haven't seen SMO 5681 lately."
SMO 3 says: "Man, that goof."
SMO 1 says: "Yeah, I hate that goof."
SMO 1 says: "You ever notice goofs always askin' how you're doin'?"
SMO 1 says: "What is that?"
SMO 1 says: "Uh, yeah, I'm fine."
SMO 3 says: "Yeah, 100%."
SMO 4 tries to throw donuts straight from the bag into his mouth, but they keep hitting the screen and falling to the floor. From somewhere in the room, the sound of feet walking gets SMO 1's attention.
SMO 1 says: "Oh!"
SMO 1 says: "Hey, what are you doing over there by yourself?"
An SMO with an orange screen and orange legs turns around.
SMO 5 says: "Uh, oh, I-- I'm sad."
SMO 1 says: "Oh, yeah, y'know we've all been there."
SMO 1 says: "So anyway, how's your goofy wife doin'?"
The scene pans over to SMO 5. We see the inside of SMO 5, which is really just Finn, BMO, and Jake hiding inside an SMO shell. They are using Jake as the face and legs of the SMO.
Finn says: "BMO, how are you doing?"
BMO says: "Get me close to that guy's port."
BMO says: "I can hack into his computer and find out where my driver port is!"
Jake says: "Ah, we gotta hustle!"
SMO 1 says: "Yeah, pretty good, I guess."
SMO 1 says: "I prefer something yeastier."
SMO 1 says: "The wife is always giving me grief about that."
SMO 1 says: "But I mean, what am I, decent?"
Inside the SMO shell, while SMO 1 is talking, Jake takes a cord from BMO and plugs it into the back of SMO 1. Suddenly, SMO 1's face is shocked and is then frozen as BMO accesses the file "MAP.MO". He starts shaking.
SMO 4 says: "Hey, what are you two goofs doin'?"
SMO 4 says: "Goofing?"
We see inside the SMO shell again, and we see the map on BMO's screen. The map scrolls down to the bottom.
Jake says: "Dang, man, how deep does this place go?"
Finn says: "Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down."
Finn says: "Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down."
They throw down SMO 1 and jump out of the shell.
Finn says: "Psych!"
SMO 3 says: "Hey, woah!"
The three get to a metal grate.
Finn says: "Down that grate!"
Jake breaks it and they go under it. We see seven SMOs after them, telling them to stop. The scene changes to below the grate. The three fall down perfectly timed with the tram, driven by DMO. They land right on top of it. They look behind them and see an SMO poking his head out of the ceiling.
DMO says: "Hey!"
DMO says: "Only MOs are allowed in the facility 1,000%!"
DMO says: "Get off of my tram!"
Jake says: "Cram your tram!"
Jake says: "Womp!"
Finn turns to look at him and gives smiles at him, raising his fists in the air. Jake pulls a lever by the driver's seat, making them go even faster. Finn laughs and looks down at BMO.
Finn says: "Hang in there, BMO!"
BMO flashes a weak thumbs up on his screen.
Finn says: "Hey, Jake!"
Finn is interrupted by an explosion behind him. He and BMO are thrown to the front of the tram.
Finn says: "Woah!"
Finn says: "Shoot, it's the fuzz!"
Behind them, a tram with ten SMOs and DMO is following them.
DMO says: "Hit 'em again!"
The SMOs shoot the tram. Almost half of the tram is gone.
Jake says: "Finn, how are we getting to BMO's driver port?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Uh, turn right!"
Jake turns the tram right. The SMOs tram continues forward, but using a shortcut, they get behind them again.
Finn says: "Dog it, they're still behind us!"
Finn says: "Turn left!"
They drive through a road beneath another. The SMO's tram goes on the top road.
Finn says: "Turn Corkscrew!"
They now drive in a 3D DNA-like path. This time, there is two curves. The two trams loop around each other. Eventually, they merge into one track.
Finn says: "Now go down!"
Jake makes the tram face completely downward. Finn, Jake, and BMO fall off. Jake stretches into a shield below them. They break through three different floors. One room has a B port, but they fall too quickly.
Finn says: "There's a driver port!"
In the last room they fall through, Jake turns into a parachute. They land on the floor of a huge, white room. Finn and Jake groan with their pains from falling.
Finn says: "Too spicy."
Jake says: "My bod!"
Behind them, ten SMOs and DMO from the tram fall through the ceiling, crashing on top of one another.
SMO 6 says: "Non-MOs are forbidden in this facility!"
BMO says: "I am not non-MO."
SMO 6 still charges his laser gun.
BMO says: "I am BMO!"
SMO 6 shoots his laser at the ceiling so he doesn't shoot anybody.
SMO 6 says: "BMO."
A light flashes in the faces of the SMOs.
Moe says: "BMO?"
Moe says: "Did I hear BMO?"
Jake says: "Wait, what's up?"
We see the lights are coming from a room with MMO and Moe. MMO takes Moe out of his chair and cradles him. MMO carries him down to where Finn, Jake, the SMOs and where DMO is, with little unknown MOs trailing behind, holding life support equipment and tools.
Moe says: "Hey, I'm Moe!"
Moe says: "Don't worry!"
Moe says: "My legs don't work!"
Finn says: "You're Moe?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Wait, are you human, too?"
Moe says: "My skin is human!"
Jake says: "Dude, how old are you?!"
Jake says: "!"
Moe says: "Hey, come on, now!"
Moe says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "So..."
Finn says: "you made BMO?"
Jake says: "Hey, you're not gonna reset our friend's personality, are you?"
Moe says: "Huh?"
Moe says: "What?"
Moe says: "No..."
Moe says: "BMO's one of a kind."
Moe says: "I built BMO to take care of my son."
Moe says: "Hoping to find a family home."
Moe says: "And then maybe even find somebody else's little boy to take care of."
Finn says: "Aw."
Moe says: "Oh, there's that back-up driver disk!"
BMO says: "Ooh!"
BMO says: "Are you my grandpoop?"
Moe says: "Nah, I'm just your poop."
BMO gasps and runs up to Moe to give him a hug.
Jake says: "Wait, did you say you built a million robots?"
Finn says: "Yeah, all we saw was that tram jerk and all those jerky security jerks!"
Moe says: "Ah, those were just the surface jerks."
Moe says: "BMO, say hello to your family."
BMO says: "Hello, family."
All of the MOs turn up to look at him.
MOs says: "Hi, BMO!"
BMO puts his hands on his smiling face.
Episode ends.
