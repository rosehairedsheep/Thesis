The episode begins at Princess Bubblegum's Mallow Tea Ceremony. She, Finn, Jake, Lumpy Space Princess, and Hot Dog Princess are there.
Finn says: "Whoop!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Whoop!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Whoopiiieee..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Cheers, Lumpy Space Princess."
Everyone cheers.
Jake says: "Bouncing!"
Finn says: "Princess, this tea party sucks in a big way!"
Finn says: "But thanks for the invite!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, don't worry, Finn."
Princess Bubblegum says: "The Mallow Tea Ceremony takes years to master."
Finn says: "Princess!"
Finn says: "I think I just now mastered it!"
Finn says: "Unh!"
Finn says: "Tea partying's hard, huh, Jake?"
Jake says: "Oof!"
Jake says: "Yes!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What?!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "No way!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "It's super easy!"
Finn says: "Lumpy Space Princess, you big faker!"
Finn says: "You're floating, not bouncing!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Fine."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'll prove it."
Jake says: "AAAAAGH!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Sorry I bit your leg."
Jake says: "You're still biting me!!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, my gosh."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, right."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Sorry."
Finn says: "Dude!"
Finn says: "Your leg!"
Jake says: "This is..."
Jake says: "new."
Jake says: "It's nothin' ominous, though."
Jake says: "Just a bump."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Nah, that's no bump."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "It's the early stage of the lumps."
Finn says: "Is it serious?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "It just means he's changing into a Lumpy Space guy, on account of my bite."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "It's just like, um, y'know..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "werewolf rules?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Ar, rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr!"
Finn says: "Oh, no!"
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "You think I'm gonna turn all lumpy like her?"
Jake says: "Get outta here."
Jake says: "Wha?"
Jake says: "Finn, I think I'm freakin' out!"
Finn says: "Calm down, bud!"
Finn says: "I'll..."
Finn says: "I'll sock the lumpiness outta ya!"
Teacup falls on the ground and shatters.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hey, now!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Royal intervention!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Surely there must be an antidote to the lumps."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Yeah."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "There's an antidote, but you have to go all the way to Lumpy Space to get it."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "And Jake has to use it by sunset."
Princess Bubblegum says: "What happens if he doesn't take the antidote by sunset?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "He'll be lumpy, like, forever."
Finn says: "LSP, please!"
Finn says: "Can you tell us how to reach Lumpy Space?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Yeah, I mean, there's a portal nearby."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I can show you whenever."
Finn says: "Take us now!"
Jake says: "Take us now!"
Finn says: "Take us now!"
Jake says: "Take us now!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Don't go telling everyone about this portal or whatever."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "It's kind of a secret."
Finn and Jake look around.
Finn says: "Where is it?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Portal's that Frog and mushroom."
Frog jumps on mushroom with a ribbit.
Frog says: "Password, please."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Whatevers2009!!"
Frog says: "Good day, Princess."
Frog says: "Is your father okay with you entering Lumpy Space with two..."
Frog says: "non-Lumpers?"
Finn says: "Just say yes!"
Finn says: "Yes, yes, yes!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Yeah, whatever, fine."
The frog extends its tongue to the three and sucks them into his mouth, transporting them to Lumpy Space.
Scene changes to Lumpy Space. Finn is thrown toward a lumpy cloud where LSP and Jake are waiting for him.
Finn says: "AAAAH!!"
Finn says: "Whoa..."
Finn says: "Lumpy Space."
Finn says: "So, where's the antidote?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Hold it."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "First, you should check out my house."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "It's, like, kind of lame, but way less lame than, like, your house."
Jake says: "Uh, could you skip to the part where you tell us where the antidote is?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "It's up there at Makeout Point."
Finn says: "That's so close!"
Finn says: "We can run there in no..."
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "time."
Finn says: "Aww, what?!!"
Finn says: "!!"
Finn says: "It's, like, a million-mile fall into space!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Yeah."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You have to travel by car in my world, or else you'll fall into the Lumpy Abyss."
Lumpy Space King says: "Daughter!!"
Lumpy Space King says: "Have you brought smooth people into our domain?!"
Lumpy Space King says: "!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I had to, Dad..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm trying to help them, so don't lumping yell at me!"
Lumpy Space Queen says: "WHAT DID YOU SAY?!"
Lumpy Space Queen says: "!"
Lumpy Space Queen says: "What did you just say?!"
Lumpy Space Queen says: "!"
Lumpy Space Queen says: "?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I SAID, "LUMP OFF," MOM!!!"
Finn says: "Uh..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "WHAT?!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "?!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "!"
Finn says: "Vroom vroom??"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, yeah."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I need to borrow the car."
Lumpy Space King says: "You have made your mother cry for the last time, daughter!"
Lumpy Space King says: "You are hereby banned from using the royal car!!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Shucks!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I lumping hate them!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm really, really sorry, Finn."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "But I can't help you because my parents are horrible idiots."
Finn says: "Don't you know anyone else with a car?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "My friend Melissa has a car."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "But she's dating my ex-boyfriend Brad."
Finn says: "Call her NOW."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Hmm."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Call BFF 66."
Elsewhere, Melissa's phone rings.
Melissa says: "Hello?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Hey, Melissa."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What's up?"
Finn says: "What's she saying?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm asking her, jeez!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Melissa, just listen!"
Melissa says: "Have you forgotten what day it is?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Melissa."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm trying to help out some friends."
Melissa says: "Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, Glob."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I forgot."
Finn says: "What'd she say?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "It's gonna be so flipping awesome!"
Finn says: "LSP, we don't have time for this."
Finn says: "Ask for the ride, LSP."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh—"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Wha?!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "!"
Finn says: "you should totally drive us to Makeout Point to make out with hot boys!"
Melissa says: "LSP, you're so baaaaad..."
Melissa says: "be there in a sec!"
Finn says: "Biyah."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "Sorry."
Finn says: "But Jake's lumpiness is worsening!"
Jake says: "Actually, I think I'm beating it back with sheer willpower!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Yeah, whatever."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Just don't mess with my phone again."
Melissa arrives on her car.
Melissa says: "Hi!"
Melissa drives into Finn, knocking him over.
Finn says: "Ugh..."
Finn says: "OKAY!"
Finn says: "Let's go, let's go, let's go!!"
They ride off, and Melissa's "SXY-LMP" liscense plate is revealed. Electronic music plays.
Jake says: "Aw, Finn, this music ducks, right?"
Jake says: "Gracious!"
Jake says: "That was terrible!"
Jake says: "Finn, if you can't save me from the lumps..."
Jake says: "if I do turn..."
Jake says: "if I become lumpy like them, I want you to—"
Finn says: "It's not gonna come to that."
Finn says: "But if it does, I'll bury you beneath the nicest, most shadiest tree!"
Jake says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Jake says: "I'm saying that if I go totally lumpy, then I want you to get used to lumpy Jake."
Jake says: "What did you think I was sayin'?"
Finn says: "Oh, um..."
Finn says: "CAN'T THIS CAR GO ANY FASTER?!"
Finn says: "!"
Melissa says: "We're already here!"
Melissa says: "Hi, Finn."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "We've been here for, like, five minutes."
Finn says: "Finally!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "This doesn't look like Makeout Point."
Melissa says: "This is Brad's house."
Melissa says: "You wanted a ride to Makeout Point?"
Melissa says: "You think I want to make out with you?!"
Melissa says: "!"
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "LSP, we gotta hurry!"
Finn says: "Jake's running out of time!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Hey."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "This is hard for me, too."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I mean, I used to eat chili cheese fries with Brad..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "so there's gonna be a lot of romantic tension on this ride!"
Brad says: "Hey."
Melissa says: "Oh, Braaaaad..."
Brad says: "You miss me yet, LSP?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Scooch over, Finn."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm gonna sit in the back."
Scene changes to when they arrive at Makeout Point.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "This is it."
Melissa parks the car.
Finn says: "Let's go!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Wait."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Watch yourself, Finn."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "The guys who use the antidote up here are notorious for being..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "smooth posers."
Finn says: "What does that mean?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "It just means what it means."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Hurry."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Get the antidote so we can get outta here."
Finn says: "Thanks, LSP."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "BUUUUMPS."
Jake says: "Um..."
Jake says: "bumps."
Finn says: "Uh, yeah, bumps."
Jake's skin bulges up more.
Jake says: "Aw, man!"
They hurry over and come to three Lumpy Space People, Glasses, Monty, and Lenny.
Finn says: "Hey, guys."
Finn says: "Lookin' smooth!"
Glasses says: "Really?"
Glasses says: "You think we're smooth?"
Finn says: "Well, mostly you in the center, but yeah!"
Monty says: "Why are you sucking up to us?"
Finn says: "My best friend needs an antidote for lumpiness."
Lenny says: "Chyah, lumpiness suuucks."
Lenny says: "Hey, Monty, time's up, sphere-hog!"
Finn says: "So the antidote is in that orb you were sitting on!"
Lenny says: "This orb is the antidote, bruh."
Finn says: "Can my friend borrow it?"
Lenny says: "Yeah, sure, as long as you give it right back."
Finn says: "Hammacow."
Finn says: "Thanks, fellas."
Lumpy Space Princess enters.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What's taking so long?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Did those smooth-heads give you the orb already, or what?"
Lenny takes the sphere back.
Finn says: "Wait!!"
Lenny says: "Is this another friend of yours?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What do you care?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Just give 'em the antidote already, and stop being such a poser."
Monty says: "Sorry, kid."
Monty says: "We changed our minds."
Finn says: "Why did you have to say all those rude things to them?!"
Finn says: "!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I was helping you."
Finn says: "They were right about to hand over the antidote!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You're welcome a lot."
Finn says: "You insulted them!"
Finn says: "And they got mad!"
Finn says: "And now Jake's gonna be lumpy forever!"
Finn says: "This is all your fault!!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Wow."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Now I know how you really feel."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I was just trying to help, but whatever."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Not like the fake ones I have here!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "So do what you want!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm going to Promcoming!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Are you coming or not, Lumpy Jake?"
Jake says: "No."
Jake says: "Because no matter how messed up and lumpy I get, this guy never turns his back on me!"
Finn says: "JAKE!"
Finn says: "IT'S ALMOST SUNSET!!"
Finn says: "I'LL KILL YOU, LUMPY SPAAAAAACE!!"
Monty says: "Jam on, man!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "I thought you guys left!"
Monty says: "We were drawn back by your plaintive wail."
Monty says: "We dig your directionless fury."
Finn says: "Um, thanks."
Monty says: "Respect."
Monty says: "Here."
Monty says: "Take it."
Monty says: "Win your girl back!"
Finn says: "Yeah, there's no girl."
Finn says: "But there is still time to save Jake!"
Finn says: "Do you guys know where Promcoming is?"
Monty says: "Promcoming takes place way down on that land-lump."
Finn says: "Awesome."
Finn says: "Do any of y'all have wheels?"
Monty says: "Nah."
Monty says: "We were all ditched here just like you."
Finn says: "Well..."
Finn says: "you think I can make it to that land-lump if I jumped off this cliff?"
Monty says: "You kidding?!"
Monty says: "!"
Monty says: "A smoothie like you will plummet right into the eternal void!"
Finn says: "What if I was lumpy?"
Finn says: "Could I float over?"
Lenny says: "No, no!"
Lenny says: "It's too dangerous!"
Glasses says: "I'd say there's a 50/50 chance of you making it!"
Finn says: "That's good enough for me."
Finn says: "Now bite me!!"
The three respond in disbelief all at once, then Finn forces them to bite him.
Finn says: "Yes!"
Finn says: "I can feel the multiple bites accelerating the lumpification process!"
Finn says: "I'm starting to float!"
Lenny says: "Don't jump, guy!!"
Finn says: "I have to!"
Finn says: "For my buddy."
Finn says: "RAAAAAAGH!!!!"
Glasses says: "Wow."
Glasses says: "He's insane."
Finn successfully lands through the roof of Promcoming.
Finn says: "Ah, I made it!"
Finn says: "And there he is!"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Promcoming!"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Cool!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "I'm mostly lumpy now!"
Finn says: "And I totally think you should sit on this sphere!"
Jake says: "No!"
Finn tries to force him to sit on it to no avail.
Finn says: "Sit on it!"
Jake says: "No!!"
Finn says: "Please, Jake!"
Finn says: "You're my best friend!"
Finn says: "Just sit on the sphere!"
Jake says: "Chyah!"
Jake says: "I remember you!"
Jake says: "You're just a smoothie wannabe lumpy poser!"
Finn says: "Sit on it!!"
Finn says: "Before I turn completely lumpy!!"
Jake says: "NO!!"
Finn says: "Oh, no!"
Finn says: "I can feel the lumpiness..."
Finn says: "about to consume me!!"
Finn says: "Oh, yah."
Finn says: "Being lumpy's the best."
Jake says: "Hey."
Jake says: "Stop talkin' to yourself, dumb guy."
Jake says: "Take your ball and get outta here."
Finn says: "Fine."
Finn says: "I don't want you to have it anyway."
Jake says: "So I can't have it now, eh?"
Finn says: "That's right."
Finn says: "It's mine."
Jake says: "GIMME THAT BALL!!"
Finn says: "NO!"
Finn says: "You can't have it!"
Jake says: "I want it!"
Jake says: "Give it to me!"
Finn says: "You want it that bad?"
Finn says: "Go get it, then!"
Jake says: "Bumps, bi—"
Jake says: "Oh, I'm not lumpy anymore!"
Jake says: "Oh, no."
Jake says: "Finn buddy!"
Jake says: "You gotta sit on this!"
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "You can't make me!"
Finn says: "Smooth—"
Finn says: "OOF!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "Hey, Finn!"
Jake says: "Hey, buddy!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Hey, dude."
Jake says: "We made it."
Finn says: "Man..."
Finn says: "There's something cold under my butt."
Finn says: "The antidote!"
Finn says: "Just in time, too!"
Finn says: "LSP, I'm sorry I blew up at you before."
Finn says: "I didn't mean it."
Finn says: "I was just really stressed out."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You know, it's fine."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You and Jake can make it up to me by dancing this last dance with me."
Finn says: "Sounds good to me."
Finn says: "Whaddaya say, Jake?"
Jake says: "That sounds totally lame."
Everyone gasps.
Jake says: "I'm just kidding."
Jake says: "Let's dance!"
Everyone resumes dancing and the episode ends.
