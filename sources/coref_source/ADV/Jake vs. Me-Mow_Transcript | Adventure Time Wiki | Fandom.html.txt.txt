Jake says: "You've got a lot of meat, Wildberry Princess."
Wildberry Princess says: "Yeah, well, you know."
Finn says: "Thanks for cook-a-looking for us."
Wildberry Princess says: "Oh, you're welcome, Finn, and thank you for answering my urgent summons."
Finn says: "Hey, yeah."
Finn says: "How can we aid thee?"
Wildberry Princess says: "Oh, it's nothing really."
Wildberry Princess says: "Someone's trying to kill me."
Finn and Jake spit take, their food flies in each other’s mouth, Finn gags.
Jake says: "Still tastes good."
Wildberry Princess says: "It's no big deal."
Wildberry Princess says: "Finish your pie."
Finn says: "It is a big deal, and I demand deets."
Wildberry Princess says: "Okay."
Wildberry Princess says: "I suspect that I've been targeted by the Guild of Assassins."
Finn says: "Whoa, how do you know?"
Wildberry Princess says: "I found this note stabbed to my door..."
Wildberry Princess says: "man."
Finn says: "Princess, we vow to protect your juice."
Finn says: "Right, Jake?"
Jake is devouring a pie messily.
Jake says: "Sometimes, I think there's a monster who lives in my stomach, and that's why I'm hungry all the time."
Finn says: "Uhh, Princess, let's continue this briefing outside."
Finn says: "I can't look at his mouth when he gets like this."
Close-up of Jake's mouth belching, Finn and Wildberry Princess leave the room. Jake puts down the pie tin and wipes his mouth, eyes another pie and taps the table with his arm.
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Me-Mow says: "."
Jake says: "You're the assassin!"
Me-Mow says: "Me-mow, assassin second class,..."
Me-Mow says: "but once I take out a princess, I g'aduate to full membership."
Jake says: "Well, I'm no princess, sister!"
Me-Mow says: "Yes, I know, but since you've blown my cover, you will slay Wildberry Princess."
Jake says: "What!"
Jake says: "?"
Jake says: "I'd rather be injected with poison!"
Me-Mow says: "Oh."
Me-Mow says: "Uh..."
Me-Mow says: "okay."
Jake says: "I mean, I will assassinate Wildberry Princess."
Me-Mow says: "Good."
Me-Mow says: "Oh, and if you try to trick me, I'll poison you."
Me-Mow says: "Blagh!"
Me-Mow says: "It's like worn garbage up in here!"
Finn and Wildberry Princess re-enter.
Wildberry Princess says: "You done in there, Jake?"
Jake says: "Oh, uh, yeah."
Jake says: "So, um, Wildberry Princess."
Jake says: "So, maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be killed."
Wildberry Princess says: "W-w-why would you say that?"
Finn says: "Dude, are you trying to freak her out?"
Jake says: "I don't know."
Jake says: "I'm just thinking out loud here."
Finn says: "Are you trying to freak me out?"
Jake says: "Uh, I'm sorry, Wildberry Prin..."
Jake says: "cess..."
Me-Mow says: "What's going on out there?"
Jake says: "Eat this!"
Jake says: "And that!"
Jake says: "Ooh, how do you like this, Princess!"
Jake says: "Duoo!"
Wildberry Princess says: "Uh..."
Wildberry Princess says: "That's very good?"
Jake says: "I'm gonna pick you up now and carry you..."
Jake says: "to the window!"
Jake carries meatbag to the window.
Finn says: "Jake, what are you..."
Wildberry Princess says: "No!"
Wildberry Princess says: "Stop!"
Wildberry Princess says: "Please!"
Me-mow smiles, Jake tosses meatbag out the window and it splats on the ground.
Jake says: "Wildberry Princess is dead!"
Me-Mow says: "You did it!"
Me-Mow says: "Well done!"
Me-Mow says: "I guess I'll be on my way."
Goes to pick up her syringe when a voice pipes up.
Wildberry Guard #1 says: "Princess!"
Wildberry Guard #1 says: "Oh, Princess!"
Wildberry Guard #2 says: "You're alive!"
Wildberry Guard #1 says: "We saw your crown next to a pile of dirtied meat, then we skipped on the meat and I thought I tasted your juice, but it was just blood from the meat."
Wildberry Guard #1 says: "We're so glad it wasn't actually you!"
Finn says: "Jake?"
Me-Mow says: "Okay, Jake."
Jake says: "Finn  help me!"
Finn says: "What's wrong?"
Me-Mow says: "If you say anything, I'll stab you in the brain!"
Jake says: "Uhh..."
Jake says: "Finn, uh, sing mom's lullaby."
Jake says: "I'm so tired, Finn, from the meat."
Jake says: "Please, you have to lull me to sleep."
Finn says: "Uhhh..."
Jake says: "I know you carry mom's music box around in your backpack!"
Finn says: "Dude, I'm not going to sing mom's lullaby in front of other people..."
Jake says: "Please, pleeeaaase..."
Finn says: "Alright, real quick while the princess is distracted."
Finn says: "."
Finn starts to fall over, lulled to sleep himself.
Jake says: "Finn there's an assassin in my nose and she poisoned me and is making me kill Wildberry Princess!"
Finn says: "Dude, stop playing games!"
Finn says: "This is serious!"
Jake covers Finn's mouth and grabs some meat from one of the pies and spells "cat → nose," but it's a bit sloppy.
Finn says: "Cat..."
Finn says: "noise?"
Finn says: "Oh, cats go "meow."
Finn says: "" Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow."
Jake says: "Shh!"
Finn says: "Meowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeow!"
Jake says: "Shh!"
Jake says: "Shh!"
Jake says: "Shh!"
Jake wraps Finn up in his arms to quiet him, Finn mumbles loudly.
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "What are you doing?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Me-mow?"
Jake says: "Still asleep?"
Me-Mow says: "Gonna double cross Jake..."
Me-Mow says: "and leave him to die..."
Jake says: "Phew..."
Jake says: "If I can just grab that antidote..."
Jake says: "Ah-ha!"
Me-Mow says: "Puppy..."
Me-Mow says: "hoodies..."
Jake says: "I did it!"
Finn comes back in the door.
Finn says: "What the flop, Jake!"
Jake says: "Noooooo!!"
Me-mow says: "Treachery!"
Me-mow says: "Hiya!"
Jake groans in pain.
Me-Mow says: "Time's running out, Jake!"
Me-Mow says: "Do you want the antidote, or not?"
Finn says: "What is wrong with you!"
Jake says: "Hey, everybody, everything's cool..."
Finn says: "Everything's not cool, Wildberry Princess is still in danger!"
Jake says: "Right, right, well, we should take her somewhere safer..."
Me-Mow says: "Don't make me give you the rest."
Jake says: "I know where to stash you, princess."
Jake says: "Follow me."
Scene cuts to the top of a high cliff.
Jake says: "Here, nobody can take us by surprise."
Jake says: "Finn, stand here with your back to the cliff."
Jake says: "I'll stay with Wildberry Princess."
Wildberry Princess says: "Oh, my, look at how close to the edge I am!"
Me-Mow says: "Do it, Jake, do it!"
Jake says: "I..."
Jake says: "I..."
Jake says: "I probably shouldn't!"
A bird swoops down trying to eat one of the sausages in Jake's ears; it hits him in the head and knocks Me-mow out onto the grass.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "I'm full of poison..."
Finn says: "The assassin!"
Me-Mow says: "The name's Me-mow."
Finn says: "If you let Jake die, so help me I will kill you too!"
Me-Mow says: "Try it, oaf!"
Finn says: "Give me the antidote!"
Me-mow jumps on Finn's arm and runs around to his back and up his head in a comically long sequence demonstrating her size, she then jumps in a tree.
Finn says: "Face me, cat!"
Me-mow spits a knife out of her throat, and climbs down a tree, same as previous style. She puts a small cut in Finn's leg.
Finn says: "Ugh, ow!"
Me-mow slices one of Finn's backpack straps and gives him a small cut on the cheek.
Finn says: "Give it up, Me-mow!"
Finn says: "You're only making my face look cooler!"
Finn throws his sword at Me-mow who is on a branch; it misses and gets stuck in the tree.
Me-Mow says: "You're at my mercy!"
Finn says: "Ha, you think you're hurting me?"
Finn says: "With that tiny dagger?"
Me-Mow says: "We'll see who's laughing when you're blind!"
Me-mow jumps at Finn's face, but he blows her away knocking her into a tree. Finn goes up to pin her to the tree, she puts her knife out and Finn puts his hand on it. He grunts but holds her.
Finn says: "It's over!"
Finn says: "Give me the antidote!"
Me-Mow says: "What, this antidote?"
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "You..."
Finn says: "milk-lapper!"
Finn says: "Jake, come lick this treebark!"
Me-Mow says: "Forget it, kid."
Me-Mow says: "I gave Jake enough poison to kill a dog fifty times his size."
Finn says: "Oh, no..."
Finn says: "Wait!"
Jake says: "Wait!"
Jake says: "Dog liver times fifty-one!"
Me-Mow says: "A magic dog?"
Me-Mow says: "Nooooooo!!!!!!!"
Finn says: "How you feeling, dude?"
Jake says: "Big liver, big liver, yeah!!"
Me-Mow says: "You've ruined me!"
Me-Mow says: "I have to wait a whole year to retake the assassins test!"
Wildberry Princess says: "Aww!"
Wildberry Princess says: "What if I made you my royal pet?"
Me-mow jumps at Wildberry Princess in an attempt to attack her, but her berries pop off and Me-mow misses careening off the cliff.
Wildberry Princess says: "Oh, dear..."
Wildberry Princess says: "."
Finn says: "Nice defense mechanism, Wild B!"
Jake says: "Are you naked?"
Wildberry Princess says: "Oh, no, this is a medical condition."
Jake says: "Hehe, we all need a hospital."
Finn and Jake laugh as they walk off with Wildberry Princess.
[Scene shifts to off the cliff says: "A bird flies by with Me-mow riding it."
[Scene shifts to off the cliff says: "The episode ends with Me-mow glaring at Finn, Jake, and Wildberry Princess."
