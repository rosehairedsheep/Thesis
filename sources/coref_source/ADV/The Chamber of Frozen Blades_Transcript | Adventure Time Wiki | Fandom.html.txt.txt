Finn observes Ice King's Castle through binoculars.
Finn says: "Hour ​​six of our Ice Kingdom stakeout."
Finn says: "Abso-nothing's going on there."
Jake says: "my boogers should turn into smoke bombs."
Finn says: "Pfff."
Finn says: "You sure this tip is good, Flambo?"
Fambo says: "Come on, you know I'm on the level."
Fambo says: "The Ice King is scheming to nabs a princess today."
Fambo says: "I swears it."
Finn says: "Hmm."
Jake says: "Relax, Restless Pants."
Jake says: "A true ninja can sense the intentions of his enemies."
Jake says: "Jin."
Flambo says: "Ninjas?"
Flambo says: "Ninjas ain't real for nothing, no how."
Finn says: "Whoa, now—"
Finn says: "ninjas are real."
Finn says: "For you see,  Doo, doo, doo..."
Finn says: "Jake and I are ninjas."
Jake says: "Yep, ever since we fished this ninja manual out of a ditch."
Jake says: "Finn, booty me!"
Finn says: "Listen!"
Penguin sounds are heard.
Jake says: "Finn, I think I'm gonna take off my booties."
Jake says: "I can't flip these pages."
Ice King says: "Gunter, let's go!"
Ice King says: "I've got the overnight bag."
Gunter says: "Wenk, wenk!"
Finn says: "It's the Ice King, all right, and he's looking awful pleased with himself."
Jake says: "Uh-oh."
Jake says: "If the Ice King's so happy, he must have stolen a princess when we weren't looking, somehow."
Jake says: "That's ninja logic."
Finn says: "Then we gotta..."
Flambo says: "Ahem."
Finn gives a charcoal Flambo.
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "we gotta save that princess."
Jake says: "You got it, shino-bro!"
Jake says: "Ninja kick!"
Finn says: "Ninja kick!"
They jump away and enter the Ice King's castle.
Finn says: "Princess?"
Finn says: "Princess!"
Jake says: "Princess?"
Finn says: "Princess!"
Jake says: "Princess?"
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "Ahh..."
They regroup.
Jake says: "No princess here, man."
Finn says: "No princess?"
Finn says: "It's..."
Finn says: "a trap!"
Finn says: "We're being trapped!"
Finn says: "Ninja vanish!"
Finn says: "Evade!"
Finn says: "Evade!"
Jake says: "Nothing is trapped, dude."
Jake says: "We can't find any captured princesses, because the Ice King hasn't captured one yet."
Jake says: "He's out doin' it right now."
Finn says: "Are you sure?"
Jake says: "No."
Jake says: "It's only a ninja hunch, so we should ninja snoop for proof."
They go to the Ice King's bedroom.
Finn says: "Wait, man."
Finn says: "I-I feel uncomfortable snooping through Ice King's personal stuff."
Finn says: "It feels sorta like..."
Finn says: "a violation."
Jake says: "Whoo!"
Jake says: "Got the Ice King's diary."
Jake says: "And yet we must."
Jake says: "today I'm bringing home a special new cutie."
Finn says: "There's our proof, man!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Hmm, alright."
Finn says: "Let's use our ninja stealth and hide until he comes back with the princess."
Jake shrinks.
Jake says: "Or..."
Jake says: "we could keep looking through his stuff."
Jake says: "Heh, heh, heh!"
Jake says: "You know, for more proof?"
Jake says: "Hehehe!"
Finn says: "No."
Jake says: "Where are we gonna hide?"
Finn says: "In this filthy hamper!"
Finn says: "Think he's there yet?"
Jake goes to see.
Finn says: "See anything?"
Jake says: "Nah."
Jake says: "Hey, Finn, I don't want to hide in the hamper anymore; it reeks in here."
Finn says: "But we're ninjas!"
Finn says: "And this is our ninja hideout."
Jake says: "Nah, man."
Jake says: "My sense of smell is, like, one thousand times better than yours."
Jake says: "Also, the hamper's boring."
Jake says: "I'm out."
Finn says: "Wait!"
Jake leaves the basket.
Jake says: "I'm out!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Get back here!"
Finn says: "Hey, wait up!"
Jake says: "Check this out!"
They both look the Ice King's drawings on the computer and laugh.
Finn says: "Weird."
Jake says: "I want to draw something."
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "We gotta leave no trace!"
Finn says: "Ninjas leave no trace!"
Jake says: "I'll delete it after!"
Finn says: "Hey, come on!"
They laugh and Finn accidentally pushes the computer table. It slides across the floor and crashes into a glass wall, shattering it.
Finn says: "Jake, what have we done?"
Both says: "A secret hidden room full of ninja stuff!"
The scene changes to the Ice King laughing and flying to a Rock Hospital.
Ice King says: "Excuse me."
Ice King says: "Excuse me."
Ice King says: "Pardon me."
Rock Man says: "Uhh, I-I think you were actually ahead of me."
Ice King says: "preferably those of a princessy type."
Rock Nurse says: "And are you checking in as a patient or a cadaver?"
Ice King says: "Hey!"
Ice King says: "I'm as healthy as ten old men!"
Gunter complains weakly.
Ice King says: "Ah!"
Ice King says: "Oh, oh, right!"
Ice King says: "My penguin—"
Ice King says: "he's very, very sick."
Ice King says: "So..."
Ice King says: "what time does your shift end?"
The scene switches to Jake walking down stairs.
Jake says: "What kind of guy builds a cave inside of another a cave?"
Jake says: "Whoo!"
Finn says: "Dude!"
Finn says: "Leave no trace!"
Jake says: "Ah, it's too late for that."
Finn says: "It's not too..."
Finn says: "late."
Finn says: "WHOA!"
Jake says: "What'cha got there?"
Finn says: "Dude!"
Finn says: "It's a first-edition Ice Ninja Manual!"
Jake gasps deeply.
Jake says: "numb-chucks."
Finn says: "Hey."
Finn says: "Ice King seems way into ninjas, even more than we are."
Finn says: "So..."
Finn says: "doesn't that mean that ninjas must be..."
Finn says: "kinda lame?"
Jake says: "Nah, they're still cool."
Jake says: "But Ice King's still lame because he hides his ninja love."
Jake says: "We wear our ninja on our sleeves!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Show me how to do that."
The scene changes to Gunter and Ice King waiting in a hospital ward.
Ice King says: "What's taking that doctor so long?"
Ice King says: "Gunter, make more noise!"
Gunter says: "WUAH!"
Gunter says: "WUAH!"
Ice King says: "Yeah, alright."
Ice King says: "Don't oversell it, drama queen."
Doctor Princess enters the room.
Dr. Princess says: "Dun, dun, dunnn."
Dr. Princess says: "Pardon the intrusion."
Dr. Princess says: "I'm Doctor Princess."
Ice King says: "Yes, well, uh..."
Ice King says: "Come to Ice King, Princess."
Dr. Princess says: "Don't worry, sir."
Dr. Princess says: "I specialize in treating little tuxedo people."
Ice King says: "Just give it to me straight, doc."
Ice King says: "Am I gonna have to pay for this?"
Dr. Princess says: "Hmm..."
Gunter says: "Wenk-wenk."
Gunter says: "Wenk-wenk."
Gunter says: "Wenk-wenk."
Dr. Princess says: "Oh, my!"
Ice King says: "What can you do for him, Doctor Princess?"
Ice King says: "Without Gunter, I'll be all alone."
Ice King says: "You see, I'm a widower."
Dr. Princess says: "Oh, I'm sorry."
Dr. Princess says: "How did your wife die?"
Ice King says: "Oh, what?"
Ice King says: "Is that what that means?"
Dr. Princess says: "Whoa, Nelly!"
Dr. Princess says: "Something medical is happening!"
Gunter inflates even more.
Ice King says: "Gunter, you're embarrassing me!"
The scene changes to Finn and Jake practicing ninja techniques.
Finn says: "Get ready to be..."
Finn says: "cold cut!"
They fight. Finn breaks a TV and a seat. Jake breaks his dagger. They leave the room.
Jake says: "Hyah!"
Finn says: "Kunai attack!"
The kunai break loose some icicles from the ceiling.
Jake says: "Icicle kick!"
Finn says: "Force of blizzard!"
The avalanche breaks the Ice King's chair.
Jake says: "Flying jump!"
Jake brings up three clones of himself.
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Three Jakes?"
Finn says: "That's one too many."
Finn says: "Caltrop hailstorm!"
Finn says: "Those Jakes were all fakes!"
Finn says: "Hiyah!"
Finn says: "Rad."
Jake's eyes glow and sparkle Ahh...
Both says: "WOOHOO!"
Both says: "YEAH!"
They hear whistling from outside.
Finn says: "It's the Ice King!"
Finn says: "Hide!"
Ice King says: "Okay, m'dear, this enclosure will be your new home!"
Jake says: "Hai!"
Finn says: "Snow blind!"
Jake says: "Thin ice, thin ice, thin ice!"
Ice King says: "..."
Ice King says: "but once you get used to the smell of penguin manure, it's almost tolerable."
Finn and Jake jump through the air wielding ice ninja weapons.
Finn says: "Ice King, hand over that princess!"
Ice King says: "Princess?"
Ice King says: "What?"
Finn says: "Jake, where's the princess?"
Jake says: "Ooh, right."
Ice King says: "What princess?"
Finn says: "The, um..."
Finn says: "princess you were just talking to?"
Jake says: "Yeah, the one you just came back from stealin'."
Ice King says: "Wrong-o."
Ice King says: "I was at the hospital, for it turns out Gunter here was preggers!"
Gunter shows his egg.
Gunter says: "Wenk."
Ice King says: "I was just talking to the egg!"
Ice King says: "It's such a cutie!"
Jake says: "Gunther's a woman?!"
Jake says: "!"
Ice King says: "What?"
Ice King says: "No!"
Ice King says: "What happened to my recliner?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Finn says: "Ohh..."
Ice King says: "My skins and tubs!"
Ice King says: "You even violated my secret sanctum?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Ice King says: "What is wrong with you?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Finn says: "No princess?"
Ice King says: "No!"
Ice King says: "No princess!"
Finn and Jake's weapons disappear.
Finn says: "We messed up, Jake."
Finn says: "We're..."
Finn says: "violators!"
Ice King says: "Yeah, what the heck?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Ice King says: "You think you can just wreck my house and wear my collectibles?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Ice King says: "Hah!"
Ice King says: "Who do you guys think you are?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Finn says: "We're..."
Finn says: "ninjas?"
Ice King says: "You're not ninjas!"
Ice King says: "You're just a couple of jerks!"
Finn and Jake fall to the ground.
Finn says: "It's true."
Finn says: "Ice King, we're gonna make this right."
Ice King says: "Yeah, do it; make it right."
Ice King says: "And start by, uh..."
Ice King says: "oh, take my bag over to the cage."
Finn takes the bag and Ice King laughs. Then muffled noises are heard from the bag and Finn realizes.
Ice King says: "Oh, no, no, no!"
Ice King says: "Not that!"
Ice King says: "Never mind!"
Ice King says: "Put that down and go clean my gym equipment."
Finn opens the bag and out comes Doctor Princess.
Finn says: "Doctor Princess!"
Ice King says: "Oh, heh..."
Ice King says: "I have no idea how that got in there!"
Finn says: "What's goin' on?"
Dr. Princess says: "I'll field that one."
Dr. Princess says: "The Ice King abducted me while I was distracted by the horrifying beauty of birth."
Gunter rubs the egg on his face.
Ice King says: "Yes, Gunter's ailment was the perfect cover for stealing a princess, M."
Ice King says: "D."
Dr. Princess says: "I'm not even a real princess."
Dr. Princess says: ""Princess" is just a surname."
Ice King says: "Enough!"
Ice King says: "You may have uncovered my princess-smuggling scheme, but you'll never leave this place alive!"
Hits his palm with his fist.
Jake says: "A couple of ninjas like me and Finn can only be defeated by another ninja!"
The Ice King wraps his beard around his head.
Ice King says: "Doot, doo, doooo!"
Ice King says: "Ninja!"
Finn says: "Ninja!"
Jake says: "Ninja!"
Dr. Princess says: "What am I..."
Dr. Princess says: "looking at here, exactly?"
Finn says: "NINJA!"
Jake says: "NINJA!"
the Ice King says: "NINJA!"
Dr. Princess says: "So..."
Dr. Princess says: "how is your egg doing?"
Gunter says: "Wenk, wenk."
Dr. Princess says: "Oh."
Gunter gets onto the egg and it begins to crack. From it comes a kitten.
Ice King says: "Gunter!"
Ice King says: "Why didn't you tell me?"
Gunter says: "Weh-weh-wenk."
Ice King says: "Oh, Gunter..."
Finn and Jake kick Ice King in the face and back, respectively. Then a closing banner appears.
Episode ends.
