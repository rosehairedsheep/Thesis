Jake says: "Hmm."
Jake says: "'Make more friends with sing-talking."
Jake says: "' ♪ ♪ Hey there, Finn!"
Jake says: "Whatcha reading?"
Finn says: "It's a manuscript about "The Legend of Dead Mountain."
Finn says: "" Supposedly, if you get to the top, there's a treasure that will change you into the person you always wanted to be."
Jake says: "Ha, that's a dumb story; I love dumb stories!"
Jake says: "What would you change about yourself if you got that treasure?"
Jake says: "Fix your weird cursed grass arm so it wouldn't be weird and cursed?"
Finn says: "Nah."
Finn says: "I'd like to be taller."
Jake says: "How tall we talking about?"
Finn says: "I don't know."
Finn says: "Like, couple of inches."
Finn says: "Say..."
Finn says: "tall as Princess Bubblegum?"
Jake says: "Oh, I see."
Finn says: "Jake, how would you change yourself on Dead Mountain if only the legends were true?"
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "'Don't let him look at you or something horrible will happen."
Finn says: "' That seals the deal."
Finn says: "The twin temptations of getting to grow a couple of inches and battling an evil hermit sound like a pretty perfect day."
Finn says: "Let's go!"
Turtle Princess says: "Shh!"
Finn says: "Let's go."
Finn and Jake march up Death Mountain.
Finn says: "Gear up for battle!"
Jake says: "Gear up for battle!"
Finn says: "You smell like cattle!"
Jake says: "You smell like cattle!"
Finn says: "Gear up for battle!"
Jake says: "Gear up for battle!"
Finn says: "You smell..."
Jake says: "You smell..."
Finn says: "Like cattle!"
Jake says: "Like cattle!"
Finn says: "Monsters that get you by looking at you are so doomb."
Jake says: "Everybody knows all you need is a mirror."
Finn says: "They ought to get a new gimmick."
Finn says: "There's the evil hermit's uh..."
Finn says: "what is that?"
Finn says: "A hut?"
Jake says: "No, it's a yurt."
Finn and Jake enter the yurt, scaring away the rats inside.
Finn says: "Yah!"
Jake says: "Yah!"
Finn says: "Rats!"
Jake says: "Rats!"
Finn says: "We don't get to fight the hermit."
Jake says: "Hey look."
Finn says: "What is it, boy?"
Jake says: "The treasure."
Jake says: "Okay, here it goes."
Jake says: "Oh great treasure, make my taste buds think they're tasting fried chicken even when I eat my fruits and vegetables."
Jake says: "I don't have any fruits or vegetables on me."
Jake says: "I guess I'll find out later if that worked."
Jake says: "Your turn."
Jake says: "This place is depressing."
Finn says: "And I'm not growing taller."
Finn says: "There's nothing going on here."
Finn says: "ON TOP OF DEAD MOUNTAIN!"
Jake says: "We should have known better than to trust a book."
Finn hands Jake back the snow globe.
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "He makes one cool skeleton, though."
Finn says: "Aah!"
Finn says: "Ohh!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Finn wakes up in his bed disoriented.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Jake?"
Jake says: "You're awake!"
Jake says: "Oh, I was so worried."
Jake says: "I've been waiting with a bowl of soup."
Jake says: "It has hoops and loops and maybe some goop."
Finn says: "What happened?"
Finn says: "I don't remember getting into bed."
Jake says: "Don't worry."
Jake says: "You're gonna be fine..."
Jake says: "in no time."
Finn says: "Thanks for taking care of me."
Finn says: "You're the greatest big brother ever."
Finn says: "W-Why are you doing that?"
Jake says: "I'm not."
BMO enters the room.
BMO says: "You're awake!"
BMO says: "You want some tea?"
BMO says: "Or saltine crackers?"
Finn says: "BMO, you're my little angel."
BMO begins transforming.
BMO says: "I'm a real boy!"
BMO says: "Oh!"
Finn says: "What's happening?"
Jake says: "I don't know but it probably has something to do with your weird old eyes."
Finn says: "Something is wrong with my eyes?"
Finn jumps out of bed and runs to the mirror.
Finn says: "Aah!"
Finn says: "Hermit eyes!"
Finn says: "Dead-hermit eyes!"
Jake says: "Heh, it's fine."
Finn says: "Do you think the hermit did this..."
Finn says: "to punish me for grabbing his shades?"
Jake says: "I think maybe the eyes are the treasure."
Finn says: "So, then, am I making people what they want to be?"
Jake says: "No, because I don't want to be this awesome sweater bro."
Jake says: "But maybe that's how you see me."
Shelby squirms out from the fruit on the table.
Shelby says: "Hey dudes."
Shelby says: "Nice eyes, Finn."
Shelby says: "What's the word?"
Shelby says: "What's the haps?"
Shelby says: "What's your major?"
Shelby squirms away cackling.
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Do you see Shelby as a bookish nerd?"
Shelby says: "You're a nerd."
Finn says: "I don't know, maybe."
Finn says: "Is that bad?"
Finn's phone rings from his backpack and answers the call.
Princess Bubblegum is on the other end, but the audience can only hear indecipherable noises.
Finn says: "Hello?"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Hiya, P."
Finn says: "B."
Finn says: "What's up?"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "You need help with your speech?"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "An emergency?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "On our way."
Finn says: "Let's roll, varsity Jake."
Jake says: "Ah ah."
Jake says: "Before we go..."
Jake says: "Until you figure out how to use them, keep those peepers covered."
Princess Bubblegum says: "What to wear for my speech..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Boss next door or hot president?"
Finn says: "Is this what you needed help with?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "No, I think I got this."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hi Finn and Jake."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You guys look..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "cool."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You trying out a new look?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "that."
Starchy seen in the distance struggling with a stack of chairs.
Finn says: "Help Starchy set up chairs?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "No no no."
Princess Bubblegum says: "That."
Screens pans over to Ice King sitting on a tree.
Finn says: "Oh boy."
Finn says: "We're on it, princess."
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's probably nothing."
Princess Bubblegum says: "He's been good lately, but it's a big speech, you know."
Ice King says: "Ohh."
Ice King says: "Ah."
Finn says: "Hey Ice King!"
Jake says: "Hey Ice King!"
Ice King falls off the tree suspended upside-down by his tunic.
Ice King says: "Aah!"
Ice King says: "I'm not doing anything wrong."
Ice King says: "I was just lady-watching."
Ice King says: "Ow!"
During the fall Ice King shoots a small bolt that knocks off Finn's glasses.
Finn says: "Oh no."
Ice King's appearance reverts to that of his fully-human self.
Ice King says: "Where'd my muscles go?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Ice King says: "I'm a scrawny-armed loser!"
Jake says: "That's how you see him?"
Jake says: "That's beautiful."
Finn says: "Sure, I-I mean it's..."
Finn says: "It's hard not to sometimes."
Finn says: "Where'd those glasses go?"
Jake says: "There."
Starchy taking selfies with the sunglasses.
Finn says: "Starchy!"
Finn says: "Give those back, you thief!"
Starchy says: "Huh?"
Starchy says: "No way!"
Starchy says: "Starchy looks good!"
Finn chases Starchy around a stack of chairs.
Finn says: "Starchy, you butt!"
Starchy says: "Ohh!"
Finn says: "Oof, sorry."
Princess Bubblegum comes down.
Princess Bubblegum says: "What's going on here?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Can you explain this?"
Finn says: "I don't know."
Finn says: "I'm not a psychiatrist!"
Jake says: "Come on, let's get you home, dude."
Jake says: "Peebs, good luck with the speech."
Princess Bubblegum says: "But..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Teen boy heartthrob it is."
Jake says: "Okay, at least now we're safe from you donking up any more of our friends."
Finn says: "Nobody got hurt."
Neptr rolls out from the treasure.
Neptr says: "Have any of you guys seen BMO?"
Finn transforms Neptr into a basic microwave.
Finn says: "Aah!"
Finn says: "Did I kill Neptr?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "You turned him into a microwave."
Jake says: "So..."
Jake says: "yeah, you kind of did."
Finn says: "But..."
Finn says: "but..."
Finn says: "but..."
Finn says: "That's not how I see Neptr, is it?"
Finn says: "I like Neptr."
Finn says: "He's like my half-son."
Finn says: "If I was a better person, would I be turning my friends into better things?"
Finn says: "Am I uncaring, judgmental..."
Finn transforms into a caricature of his father.
Jake says: "Uh, Finn."
Finn says: "Self-centered?"
Finn says: "Monstrous?"
Finn says: "I'm..."
Finn says: "I'm..."
Finn says: "I'm a huge wa-a-a-a-a-d!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "You're being melodramatic!"
Jake enters the yurt.
Finn says: "I know it's you."
Jake says: "Hey, buddy."
Jake says: "I figured you'd come back here."
Finn says: "Don't look at me, Jake."
Finn says: "I might turn you into a microwave."
Jake says: "Baloney!"
Jake says: "You turned Neptr into a microwave because he's a microwave."
Jake says: "But that doesn't mean that's all he is to you."
Jake says: "I know you think Neptr is an interesting person, and I know that "microwave" is just one part of his personality."
Jake says: "I mean..."
Jake says: "maybe your eyes are just bad at describing things, you know?"
Jake says: "Like how you feel about people, what they mean to you..."
Jake says: "That stuff's in your guts."
Jake says: "Eyes can't grok that..."
Jake says: "Unless you have the eyes of like a trained artist or something."
Jake says: "But you don't."
Jake says: "I'm telling you, man: you're not a bad dude like this skeleton bro, or you'd be turning everyone into rats and plops."
Jake says: "Now come on."
Jake says: "Look at me."
Finn says: "Jake, you're so wise."
Jake transforms into a small old elf.
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Di- Wha..."
Jake says: "Well, at least you're listening to me."
Jake says: "And wise old Jakey got a plan."
Jake says: "P."
Jake says: "B."
Jake says: ", you want to go first?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "He may not be the most cunning soldier, but one thing about Finn is that he always puts other people first, and that makes him a true hero."
Finn transforms in a Spartan soldier and then back to his caricature but wearing Spartan armor.
Starchy says: "Finn helped Starchy fart once."
Shelby says: "What a life saver."
Finn's head turns into a floatie.
Ice King says: "Finn's a mean old party pooper."
Ice King says: "Ow!"
Ice King says: "But he is the hottest guy in Ooo, so he can kind of do what he wants."
Jake says: "Finn's just the best guy to do bro stuff with, like lying on the grass and talking to bugs or baking chocolate chip cookies."
Jake says: "Finn's just a good friend."
Finn transforms back to his self with the hermit eyes.
Finn says: "I'm me again."
Finn says: "These balls are going nuts."
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "My son."
The microwave transforms the eyes and Neptr emerges simultaneously transforming everyone else.
Neptr says: "Eye pie!"
Everyone says: "Ew."
Finn says: "Good job, Neptr."
Finn says: "You saved the day."
Finn says: "Neptr!"
Finn says: "Neptr!"
Everyone runs outside Neptr held in the air.
Everyone says: "Neptr!"
Everyone says: "Neptr!"
Everyone says: "Neptr!"
Everyone says: "Neptr!"
Everyone says: "Yay!"
BMO falls from the sky and into the eye pie Jake holds.
