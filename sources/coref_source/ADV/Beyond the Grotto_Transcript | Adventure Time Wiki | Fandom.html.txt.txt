Finn says: "Eww!"
Finn says: "The sea lard’s in my bed again."
Finn says: "Gross."
Jake says: "Dude."
Jake says: "That’s like the 8th time."
Jake says: "Why don’t you just get rid of it?"
Finn says: "I don’t know what’s gotten into it lately."
Jake says: "It's gross as butts, man."
Jake says: "We’re taking care of this right now."
Finn and Jake carry the sea lard outside.
Finn says: "I can’t believe we never thought of this before."
Finn says: "The pond is the perfect place for a sea lard."
Jake says: "See ya larder!"
Finn and Jake throw the sea lard into the pond. It sinks.
Jake says: "Huh."
Finn says: "Is he, like, okay?"
Shelby climbs out of under Finn’s armpit.
Shelby says: "Well, seeing as sea lards are saltwater fish, and the pond is a freshwater environment…..."
Shelby says: "no?"
Shelby says: "He’s a stenohaline fish."
Shelby says: "Haven’t you guys ever heard of osmoregulation?"
Shelby says: "Allow me to explain."
Finn takes his pajamas off. Shelby falls.
Shelby says: "Waaaa!"
Finn says: "Sorry Shelby."
Finn says: "Gotta save the lard."
Finn holds his breath and jumps in. Jake follows. They swim to the bottom of the pond.
Jake says: "Thar!"
Finn says: "Wa?"
The lard floats into an underwater hole. Finn and Jake follow.
The lard emerges from the water. The frames show a massive structure of mud.
Water Nymphs says: "♫♪♪Smash the frogs, smash the frogs, making frog hot dogs, smash the frogs….."
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Water Nymph says: "Yo!"
Water Nymph says: "Finn and Jake are here!"
Water Nymphs #2 says: "♫♪♪Smash the frog -  Hi!"
#3 says: "♫♪♪Smash the frog -  Hi!"
Finn says: "So, this is where you guys live?"
Water Nymphs #2 says: "Yeah!"
#3 says: "Yeah!"
Water Nymph #2 says: "We’re the guardians of this grotto."
Water Nymph says: "You guys want to stay for lunch?"
Water Nymph says: "We’re making hot dogs!"
Finn says: "Hot dogs?!"
Jake says: "Hot dogs?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "?!"
Jake says: "?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Oh, wait."
Finn says: "We dropped our sea lard in the pond, and we’ve got to save it before it dies from the freshwater."
Finn says: "He’s a stenohaline fish."
The Water Nymphs look at each other.
Water Nymph #3 says: "You do know sea lards are mammals, right?"
Finn says: "I’m gonna murder Shelby."
Water Nymph says: "Well, hey, you guys should stick around."
Water Nymph says: "I’m gonna go finish cooking."
Water Nymphs #2 says: "And we gotta mash more frogs."
#3 says: "And we gotta mash more frogs."
The water nymphs leave.
Finn says: "I can’t believe I just believe Shelby ‘cause he’s a nerd."
Jake says: "Hey, it's the lard!"
Finn says: "Hey, get away from there!"
The lard sinks into a whirlpool. It gasps for breath.
Finn says: "Bad lard!"
Finn says: "Lard!!"
Water Nymph says: "Don’t go near there!"
Water Nymph says: "It’s too dangerous!"
Finn says: "Got to save this dang lard!"
Water Nymph says: "Whatever you do, don’t touch the purple stuff!"
Finn and Jake get sucked in the whirlpool.
Finn says: "WHOOAH!"
The setting changes to a different dimension, where Finn and Jake are portrayed with a simpler, different art style.
Finn wakes up on the ground, coughing.
Finn says: "What did she say?"
Finn says: "Don’t touch the purple?"
Jake wakes up, groaning.
Finn says: "What happened to the pond?"
Jake says: "And how ‘bout our treehouse?"
Jake says: "The house part’s a-gone!"
Finn says: "What the butt?"
Jake says: "I guess we went through some portal to the past or some biz."
Finn says: "Was stuff the wrong color in the past?"
The wind blows with a strange effect.
Finn says: "It's weird as carbs here."
Jake says: "There it goes!"
Finn says: "Lard!"
Finn and Jake run toward the lard. The frame pans to show an alternate dimension Finn and Jake, who begin to lick from the pink pond. The pond forms a face and speaks with Princess Bubblegum’s voice.
Pond says: "Hello, friends!"
Finn and Jake continue chasing the sea lard in the woods.
Finn says: "Lard!"
Finn says: "Lard!"
Finn says: "Lard!"
Finn says: "Lard!"
Finn says: "Lard!"
Finn says: "♫♪♪La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la laaaa!"
Jake says: "You are crazy."
Jake says: "You are so crazy!"
Finn and Jake continue walking.
Finn says: "Everything’s like, wonky here."
Finn says: "It’s familiar, but weird."
Jake says: "I like it."
Finn says: "I don’t know."
Finn says: "It kind of makes me feel… naked."
Finn says: "♫♪♪ La-la-la laaaard!"
Finn grabs the lard.
Finn says: "Gotcha!"
Finn says: "Finally, we can take you home!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Alternate dimension Marceline Leaf Marceline is playing her bass and singing a melancholy song with two other leaves.
Leaf Marceline says: "♫♪♪A one-and a-two- I’d rather be anything but me, a leaf on a tree, a bug or a bee."
Leaf Marceline says: "I just want to see the sea, I want to be free from this body, this flower body."
Finn says: "Please don’t change."
Finn says: "You’re perfect just the way you are."
Leaf Marceline says: "Oh, I know!"
Leaf Marceline says: "I just like to write sad songs."
Finn says: "Wait."
Finn says: "Hey, Jake, what were we just doing?"
Finn and Jake run away.
Leaf Marceline says: "You guys are writing this down, right?"
Finn and Jake run.
Finn says: "Why does the lard keep running away?"
Finn says: "We're trying to get it home."
Jake says: "Yeah, this place ain't safe."
A purple sparkle hits Finn's face. Then, it begins to come down like rain.
Princess Purple Patch Ice King is humming a tune.
Princess Purple Patch says: "♫♪♪bum-bum-bum, little purple, you're a catch, I love your pretty purple sash."
Princess Purple Patch says: "We're a perfect purple match, Welcome to my purple patch♫♪♪!"
Princess Purple Patch says: "I'm Princess Purple Patch, and this is my little special Purple."
Princess Purple Patch says: "Mwah!"
Jake says: "Hi, Purple."
Jake says: "I'm Ginn and he's Fake."
Jake says: "Hmm.."
Jake says: "Thats not right."
Jake says: "He's Ginn, and I'm..."
Jake says: "wait..."
Princess Purple patch says: "I'ma call you Purple Face!"
Princess Purple patch says: "You want to come play in my purple place?"
Jake gets reminded of what the water nymph said to him before.
Water Nymph says: "Don't touch the purple stuff!"
Jake says: "Weren't we supposed to not do something with the purple things?"
Finn says: "Hm?"
Princess Purple Patch says: "Oh, you want purple?"
Princess Purple Patch says: "Here, take some for the road!"
Princess Purple Patch tosses some purple toward Finn and Jake. Finn and Jake become affected by the purple, and enter a childlike state.
Princess Purple Patch says: "Oh, dear, I've purpled you."
They begin to cry and fly away.
Princess Purple Patch says: "Why do I always do this?"
Purple says: "Later."
Finn and Jake continue to play in the purple.
Jake says: "Heh!"
Jake says: "What a great gal."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Wait- what were we just doing?"
Finn says: "We were..."
Finn says: "."
Finn says: "We were..."
Finn says: "."
Finn says: "Who are we?"
Jake says: "I don't know, man."
Jake says: "But I like these things."
Finn says: "Fine."
Finn notices Jake grunting on the ground.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Ja-- Ja-- Jaaauump!"
Finn jumps in front of jake.
Finn says: "Hello."
Finn says: "Are you a lost dog?"
Finn says: "I am boy."
Jake says: "Uh.."
Jake says: "maybe?"
Finn says: "We are boy and dog."
Jake says: "I'm petting the ground, boy."
Finn says: "Looks like fun."
Finn get on the ground and sniffs it.
Finn says: "And it smells like toast."
Finn and Jake notice Bush Boots Tree Trunks crying in the distance.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Crying."
Finn says: "Long nose."
Finn says: "Investigate!"
Jake says: "Investigate!"
Bush Boots continues to cry.
Finn says: "Miss, your crying indicates you're in need of help."
Bush Boots says: "What?"
Bush Boots says: "Yes."
Bush Boots says: "I've lost my rolling pin."
Finn says: "Understood."
Finn says: "What's your name, miss?"
Finn and Jake approach Bush Boots and embrace her.
Finn says: "Hugs!"
Jake says: "Hugs!"
Bush Boots says: "The hugs helped my crying, but it didn't help me find my rolling pin."
Finn says: "Boy and dog will find your rolling pin."
Finn says: "Where did you last see it?"
Bush Boots says: "It was rolling around here not too long ago."
The sea lard rolls across the screen.
Bush Boots says: "Oh, there it goes!"
Finn and Jake begin to chase it, with bush boots far behind.
Bush Boots says: "Come back, you bad little rolling pin!"
The sea lard/rolling pin hides in the bushes.
Finn says: "Bush Boots, lets sneak up on it."
They roll toward the sea lard stealthily, and capture it.
Jake says: "Am-boosh!"
Bush Boots says: "Oh, you caught it!"
Bush Boots says: "Wonderful!"
Bush Boots says: "Come on, now."
Bush Boots says: "Just roll the dough."
The sea lard jumps out of her hands and flops around. Everyone gasps.
Bush Boots says: "Oh, its getting away again!"
Finn says: "Ma'am, I think that rolling pin is sentient."
Jake says: "Yeah, I don't think it wants to be a rolling pin."
Finn says: "Dog, we have to save that rolling pin from this sweet lady."
Finn says: "Where did it go?"
The sea lard shows itself, and rolls away. Finn and Jake run after it.
Finn says: "Rolling pin!"
Finn says: "We want to help!"
As Finn and Jake run away, Bush Boots' home becomes a train, and rolls away. Finn and Jake can't follow the sea lard's trail.
Finn says: "No more.."
Finn says: "Slime."
Jake says: "Rolling pin trail has gone cold."
A bee Bee-mo begins to buzz around them.
Finn says: "A bee."
Jake says: "I see."
Bee says: "A poem by me."
Bee says: "Listen for a sound and look around."
Unless egress is sought, smiles will not be found.
Finn says: "Hmm?"
Jake says: "Hmm?"
Bee says: "It's a metaphor."
The bee flies away and Finn and Jake follow it. They approach the pink pond from before.
Jake says: "A pink pond."
Finn says: "Pink pond?"
Finn says: "Pretty!"
Pink pond says: "Hee hee!"
Pink pond says: "Hello, friends!"
Jake says: "The pond has a face and is talking to us."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Pink pond says: "Dive in."
The pink pond turns into a whirlpool.
Finn says: "I don't feel comfortable diving into a face."
The sea lard approaches from behind them.
Finn says: "Dog, lets go back for apricot pie."
Jake says: "Yeah, pie!"
The sea lard pushes Finn and Jake into the pool.
Jake says: "Gross!"
Finn says: "Whoaaa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
The sea lard jumps in after them.
Finn and Jake return to normal Ooo, and are inside the treehouse. Ice King is staring through their window. Jake is speaking to BMO.
Jake says: "And then there was like, a PB puddle, a Marceline plant, and a little bee that looked like you, BMO!"
Jake says: "You know what?"
Jake says: "We didn't save the sea lard."
Jake says: "The sea lard saved us."
BMO says: "Yay, sea lard!"
Ice King says: "Wow, what an adventure."
Jake says: "And there was even a purple lady kind of like you, Ice King!"
Jake says: "She even sounded just like you."
Ice King says: "She sounds magnificent!"
Ice King says: "How'd you say you got there?"
Jake says: "We didn't."
Jake says: "Beat it, creep."
Ice King says: "I'll figure it out."
Ice King flies away. Finn approaches the window.
Finn says: "But Simon, if you go there, you'll lose you memories."
Ice King says: "What memories?"
Ice King says: "I'm like a goldfish over here."
Ice King looks away.
Jake says: "In what way, exactly?"
Ice King notices Jake.
Ice King says: "Oh, hey Jake."
Ice King says: "Where am I?"
The scene changes to nightfall. Finn is putting the sea lard into bed.
Finn says: "Comfy, dude?"
Finn says: "I bet you ran away 'cause we didn't appreciate you and called you gross and stuff."
Finn says: "But you're not gross."
Finn says: "Mwah!"
Finn says: "Goodnight, sea lard."
