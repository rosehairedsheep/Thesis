The episode begins with Finn and Jake spelunking in a cave. Jake yawns making a sound similar to Chewbacca from Star Wars.
Jake says: "Man..."
Jake says: "let's go home."
Finn says: "Nuts to that."
Finn says: "I wanna find a mystery cave."
Jake says: "But, Finn, I'm gettin' all cranky around my joke-hole."
Jake accidentally drops on Finn.
Finn says: "Ow!"
Jake says: "Oof!"
Finn says: "Ooh-la-la."
Jake says: "Whuzzat?"
Finn says: "Mystery cave!"
Finn says: "C'mon, Jake!"
Finn says: "Oh, my glory..."
A tiny Jake comes through the entrance then gets back to normal size. The lamb relic is seen on a pedestal at the top of pyramid-arranged stairs. Finn walks up to it and nearly touches it.
Jake says: "Dude, no!!"
Jake says: "Don't touch that thing!"
Jake says: "It's probably got some kind of sacred significance."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "I want it for my sacred bathroom."
Finn touches it and the lamb lights up.
Jake says: "Finn?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Oh, my Jah!"
Jake says: "Finn's become one with the lamb!!"
The scene is then viewed in the Spirit World version and Finn can be seen, along with numerous odd-looking Spirits.
Finn says: "Jake!!"
Finn says: "You see this crazy jazz?!"
Finn says: "!"
Normal view.
Jake says: "We'll get through this, my bro."
Jake says: "I swear, I'm gonna get you out of that lamb."
Jake goes down the pyramid steps and sits down. He tugs his tail twice and starts pulling himself out by retracting his tail.
Spirit World view.
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "C'mon quit messin' with me."
Finn says: "WHOA!"

Jake says: "Wish I knew how to free you, bro."

Spirit World view.
Finn says: "Heh heh heh heh heh!"
Jake says: "Hmm..."
Jake says: "That's it!"
Jake says: "We'll do all Finn's favorite stuff 'til he comes out!"
Jake says: "BMO!"
Jake says: "Play Finn's favorite song!"
BMO says: "Okay!"
BMO activates his music player and starts singing "Three Baby Spiders" with Jake. Cut to Spirit World view.
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Nooo..."
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "Not this song!!"

Jake says: "Are you hearing this, buddy?"

Ice King says: "Are you makin' fun of me or something?"
Finn says: "No, it's just no one else can see me or hear me talk."
Ice King says: "Ohhhh, yeah..."
Ice King says: "."
Ice King says: "You're trapped in the Spirit Realm."
Ice King says: "I can see all things Spirit with my..."

Ice King says: "I know I say that a lot, but this time it's true!"
The penguin walks away. The Spirit Realm is viewed.
Finn says: "Anyways..."
Finn says: "Where do all these spirits come from?"
Ice King says: "Oh, there are portals all over the universe."
Ice King says: "I have one in my basement!"
Ice King says: "Every once in a while, a real cutie pie drifts through."
Ice King says: "Ooh!"
Finn says: "Sick."
Ice King says: "What?"
Ice King says: "I swear I never touch 'em!"
Ice King says: "I can't!"
Ice King says: "I hate them..."
Ice King says: "Okay, alright!"
Ice King says: "'Nuff messin' around."
Ice King says: "Let's getcha free from the Spirit Plane."
Finn says: "Cool."
Cut to Ice King's basement.
Ice King says: "Sooo, the only way to get out of the Spirit World is to stick all these lousy things in the Spirit Hole down there."
Ice King says: "Then plug up the hole with that."
Finn says: "And doing that will set me back to normal??"
Ice King says: "Mm-hmmmm, trust me!"
Ice King says: "We are tur-bros!"
Ice King says: "Turbo bros!"
Ice King says: "Tur-bros."
Ice King says: "Turbo."
Ice King says: "..."
Ice King says: "Bros."
Beat. Finn scowls.
Finn says: "So be it!"
Finn scatters around and forces the Spirits in the Spirit Hole. Scene goes back to the Tree Fort in the normal view.
Jake says: "Alright, Finn."
Jake says: "This oughta free you from your body prison."
Jake says: "Couple-a' rounds of Kompy's Kastle will jog your psychic schnaps."
Jake says: "That's what I think."
Jake says: "Co-op mode like we always do!"
Jake says: "Oh, yeah!"
Jake says: "C'mon, Finn, drop the drawbridge."
Jake says: "Kompy's blood lust meter's goin' down."
Jake says: "Lemme help ya there."
Cut back to the Ice Kingdom in the Spirit World view. Finn puts another Spirit in the hole.

Finn says: "I did it."
Finn says: "I'm ready, Ice King."
Finn says: "Make me normal now."
Ice King says: "Ohhh, that's not all of 'em."
Ice King says: "There's this other guy that watches me."
Ice King says: "He's..."
Ice King says: "super creepy."
Ice King says: "GET IT IN THE HOLE!!"
Ice King says: "Yes!"
Ice King says: "It's gone!"
Finn says: "So..."
Finn says: "now I can go back to normal."
Ice King says: "Uhhh, wait, though."
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "What?"
Ice King says: "There's this last guy you gotta get."
Ice King says: "He's pretty much the worst."
Ice King says: "He usually leaves these gross heads around, but I'm not seeing them anywheâ€”"

Ice King says: "It's from the dead one."
Ice King says: "He leaves these heads around everywhere."
Ice King says: "I can't even touch them, but it still creeps me out..."
Head says: "Wanwan!"
Ice King says: "Please get rid of him!"
Finn says: "What do I do?"

The dead one is seen. It drops another head and Finn gets disgusted.
Finn says: "You better get back in the Spirit Hole, dead one."
The Dead One says: "Wamwanwan."
Finn chases after him but accidentally makes himself fall. "Oh, bolts." However, a flying spirit saves him "WHOO! Yeah! Get 'im!" and Finn uses it to catch up to the dead one. Finn runs into it "BOOSH!!" and knocks it in the hole. Finn hangs off the hole's ledge and looks inside.
Finn says: "Oh, my what?"

Finn says: "???"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Weird."
Finn says: "That's weird, but whatevs, though."
Finn says: "Dude, come on, what?"
Ice King says: "Ha ha, Finn!"
Finn says: "I'm gonna re-open the hole."
Ice King says: "NO, WAIT, MY PLAN FELL APART!!"
Ice King says: "My..."
Ice King says: "new plan is that you don't open the hole, and I destroy the porcelain lamb which will bring you back to the material plane."
Ice King says: "Heh heh..."
Ice King says: "heh."

Ice King says: "Cooool."
Ice King says: "Whaddaya think, Finn?"
Ice King says: "Can we pull back the veil of static and reach into the source of all being?"
Ice King says: "Behind this curtain of patterns..."
