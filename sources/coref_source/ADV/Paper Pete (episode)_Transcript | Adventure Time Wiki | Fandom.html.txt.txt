The episode begins with Finn and Jake in the Library carrying an enormous book.
Finn says: "It's slippin', dude."
They groan as they set it down on a table.
Finn says: "Phew."
Finn says: "Whatever, man."
Finn says: "I barely even made it through the title."
Jake says: "Listen, man."
Jake says: "One day, I'm probably gonna have half-rainbow pupsters."
Jake says: "I gotta be able to share my babies' culture."
They open the book.
Finn rocks the table.
Finn says: "Huh."
Finn says: "Hey, this table is wobbly."
Finn says: "We gotta take it to the Lost Tinker Goblin of Fog Mountain to fix it."
Jake says: "Dude, I would love to go on some crazy, made-up adventure with you, but I really gotta read this."
Jake says: "So from here on out, I'm just gonna ignore you."
Finn says: "I don't make up adventures!"
Finn says: "Jake, you know that!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "I don't make up adventures!"
Finn says: "Oh, no!"
Finn says: "Damaged books?"
Finn says: "Who did this?!"
Finn says: "!"
Turtle Princess says: "Shhhhhhhushh!"
Finn says: "Sorry."
Finn says: "I will avenge thee, slightly-soiled books."
Finn says: "Gotta tell Jake."
He starts walking back when he sees some books shake.
Finn says: "Hello?"
Finn says: "Is someone back here?"
Finn says: "Are you stuck?"
Turtle Princess says: "Shhhushmm!"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Ohhh!"
Finn says: "Hey, there's pages comin' outta these books!"
People offscreen says: "SHHHHHH!"
The pages fold themselves into Pagelings.
Finn says: "Who are you dudes?"
Pagelings says: "We are the Pagelings!"
Paper Pete says: "I am Paper Pete, the leader of the Pagelings."
Paper Pete says: "But you can call me P."
Paper Pete says: "P."
Finn says: "I'll call you Pete."
Paper Pete says: "Okay!"
Finn says: "Why are you dudes in the library?"
Paper Pete says: "We are the secret guardians of the books in the library."
Paper Pete says: "You know those blank pieces of paper in the beginning of old books?"
Finn says: "Yeah?"
Paper Pete says: "That's us!"
Paper Pete says: "We revealed ourselves to you, noble giant, because you felt our plight when you saw the damaged books."
Paper Pete says: "And now is our darkest hour, for the Moldos have been growing more bold with every attack."
Paper Pete says: "Look at the damage done yesterday  at the Battle of Teddy Bear Joke Book."
Finn says: "Wow, yeah."
Paper Pete says: "They're massing for a full-scale assault on every book in the library!"
Finn says: "Gosh!"
Finn says: "Even the Rainicornicopia?"
Paper Pete says: "Yes."
Finn says: "I better tell Jake."
Finn says: "Don't you dudes go anywhere."
Pagelings says: "Okay."
Finn runs back to Jake.
Finn says: "Hey, bro, I've got an adventure—"
Finn says: "and it's not made up!"
Finn says: "There are these- these Pagelings they came out from- from books!"
Finn says: "And they- they folded into little animals."
Jake stretches his foot onto Finn's mouth.
Finn says: "Do you hear what I'm saying?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Shhhh!"
Finn says: "You think I'm making this up?"
Finn says: "I'll prove it to you!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "Finn, you butt chicken!"
Finn says: "Jake, wait till you see 'em."
Jake tackles Finn and they bump against the bookshelf with the Pagelings, who retreat into the shelf as books fall off the shelf on top of Finn and Jake.
Finn says: "Ow."
Finn says: "They were just here!"
Finn says: "Pagelings?"
The Pagelings reappear.
Finn says: "Why didn't you dudes introduce yourselves to Jake?"
Paper Pete says: "We don't want to reveal ourselves to anyone else."
Paper Pete says: "We are the secret guardians."
Paper Pete says: "Secret."
Finn says: "Ummmm..."
Finn says: "yeah, but Jake is a powerful giant like me!"
Finn says: "He can help you battle or- or whatevs!"
Finn says: "But first, you must win his favor."
Finn says: "Do you not want victory for your people?"
Pagelings says: "Yes!"
Pagelings says: "We do want victory!"
Finn says: "C'mon, follow me."
Finn says: "Jake, look."
Jake buries his face in the book.
Finn says: "He's up here reading a book."
The Pagelings climb onto the table.
Finn says: "Do something to get his attention."
Paper Pete says: "Very well."
Paper Pete says: "We shall dance as flowers."
Other Pagelings says: "Hoo-ah!"
Finn says: "Okay."
The Pagelings turn into flowers and start dancing around Jake, who is hiding his face behind his hands.
Finn says: "Jake, the Pagelings are dancing for you."
Finn says: "Just look up for a second!"
Jake stretches his face out from underneath his hands as the Pagelings dance outside his field of vision.
Jake says: "Finn, all the little voices you're doing are cute, but come on, man!"
Jake says: "Just let me read."
The Pagelings jump onto Jake's head and transform back to normal.
Finn says: "You can feel them, can't you?"
Jake says: "I can feel you pinching me."
Finn says: "Just look up for a second!"
Finn says: "Uhhh."
Finn says: "Pagelings, I'm sorry, but my friend is acting like a clump."
Pagelings says: "Okay."
Paper Pete says: "We can't wait any longer."
Jake says: "Yeah, go play make-believe somewhere else!"
Finn says: "I'm not making believe!"
Scene cuts to Paper Pete.
Paper Pete says: "We were gone too long!"
Some Moldos are shown eating books and Finn is standing nearby.
Paper Pete says: "Wield, my brethren."
Paper Pete says: "Wield!"
They charge at the Moldos.
They start fighting the Moldos weakly and calmly.
Moldo says: "You win this battle, but next time, we will win."
The Moldos retreat.
Pagelings says: "Yes, leave!"
Pagelings says: "Victory!"
Pagelings says: "Veni, vidi, vici!"
Finn says: "So, those little squishy guys are the Moldos?"
Paper Pete says: "Aye."
Paper Pete says: "This was but a reconnaissance squad..."
Paper Pete says: "sent to test our mettle!"
Pagelings says: "Mettle!"
Finn says: "Uh-huh."
Finn says: "They seem tough."
Paper Pete says: "Their bites sting like the Dickens."
Finn says: "Hmmm..."
Finn says: "their bites sting, eh?"
Finn says: "I've got a plan, Pete."
Paper Pete says: "Tell me your plan, giant."
Finn says: "Just trust me."
Finn says: "Trust me."
Some Moldos are seen slithering past some shelves. Finn, with Paper Pete on his shoulder, peeks around the corner and sees them enter a bookshelf on the far wall. He runs toward the shelf and removes some books.
Paper Pete says: "You've discovered the Moldos' Secret Lair!"
Finn says: "Eh, it wasn't very hard."
Finn crawls through to the Moldos' lair. There are crystals growing on the walls, but no Moldos in sight.
Finn says: "Wibba-wibba-wah!"
Scream echoes and several Moldos appear.
Moldo says: "The Pagelings have a battle beast!"
Moldo says: "Attack!"
Finn says: "Whoa."
Finn says: "Whoa, moldy blobs."
Finn says: "I've come here to help the Moldos defeat the Pagelings."
Paper Pete says: "Traitor!"
Paper Pete says: "Hiyah!"
Paper Pete says: "Yah!"
Finn says: "Calm down, this is part of my plan."
Paper Pete says: "Ohhh, ha-ha!"
Paper Pete says: "Then I shall play along, wise giant."
Moldo says: "How are we to trust you?"
Finn says: "Well..."
Finn says: "here, look."
Finn says: "I brought you all a prisoner."
Finn says: "It's their leader."
Paper Pete says: "May you rot in Tartarus!"
Paper Pete says: "May your skin boil and eyes burst into flames..."
Paper Pete says: "forever in a pit!"
Scene cuts to Paper Pete being lifted up in a cage made of pencils and rulers.
Paper Pete says: "Traitor!"
Finn says: "So, do you guys have, like, a—"
Finn says: "like, a leader or somethin'?"
Moldos says: "Mildwin."
Paper Pete says: "Mildwin."
Mildwin says: "I'm Mildwin, leader of the Moldos."
Finn says: "Oh, uhh..."
Finn says: "hmm."
Finn says: "Nice to meet you, your highness."
Mildwin says: "I'm not a king; I was democratically elected."
Moldo says: "Protect the elected official!"
Paper Pete says: "Well played, ol' giant."
Finn says: "Pete, j-just stop winking."
Finn says: "Hyah!"
People says: "Shhhh!"
Finn jumps down from the bookshelf near Jake.
Finn says: "Ignore this!"
Jake says: "Hmm?"
The Moldos start eating Jake's fur.
Mildwin says: "Mmm!"
Mildwin says: "This tastes delicious!"
Jake says: "AAAAH!"
Jake says: "AAH!"
Finn says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
Jake says: "What did you do to me?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "AAAAAAH!"
Finn says: "Ummm..."
Jake says: "AH!"
Jake says: "AAAH!"
Finn says: "Uhhh..."
Finn says: "come on, you guys, knock it off."
Finn says: "The Moldos got a taste for ya now."
Finn says: "Gotta do something."
Finn says: "Where can I find ways to solve problems in a library?"
Finn says: "Books!"
Finn says: "Books!"
Finn says: "Books!"
Jake says: "Aaah!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Whatcha nibblin' me for?"
Moldo says: "This sweaty stuff tastes amazing."
Moldo says: "A-mazing!"
Finn says: "Hmmm."
Finn says: "Tastier than battle beast fur."
Finn says: "Yis!"
He notices that Turtle Princess saw this. Turtle Princess blushes and runs back to her cart of books.
Finn says: "Hey, Mildwin."
Finn says: "Mildwin!"
Mildwin says: "What?"
Finn says: "I bring a peace offering from the Pagelings."
Mildwin says: "Hmm?"
The Moldos sniff the shirt, crawl onto it, and start eating, except for two, which are latched onto Jake's closed eyelids.
Jake says: "Finn..."
Jake says: "what's happening?"
Finn says: "Hang on, buddy."
Finn says: "Paper Pete?"
Paper Pete flies in in the form of a paper plane, lands on Finn's shoulder, and transforms back to normal.
Paper Pete says: "Giant!"
Paper Pete says: "Have you wiped out the Moldo horde?"
Finn says: "Naw, man."
Finn says: "The war's over."
Finn says: "you don't attack their library books."
Mildwin says: "Agreed, beast."
Mildwin says: "This filthy garb will feed my people for generations."
Finn says: "And in forty years, you can have my shorts."
Finn says: "Sound good, Pete?"
Paper Pete says: "It will suffice."
Finn says: "Sound good, Jake?"
Jake says: "AAAH!"
Jake says: "What—"
Jake says: "What the hecks, man?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "What'd you do to me?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Look, man!"
Finn says: "Moldos and Pagelings are real!"
Jake says: "Wha—"
Jake says: "?"
Jake says: "Who cares, man?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "I'm outta here!"
Scene cuts to Finn and Jake walking away from the library.
Finn says: "Did you finish your Rainicorn book?"
Jake says: "Ugh..."
Jake says: "I was readin' the same paragraph over and over for, like, eleven minutes."
Jake says: "I guess I'm gonna give up on learnin' everything about Rainicorn history."
Jake says: "Don't tell Lady."
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "What about relating to your mixed-species kids?"
Jake says: "Eh, I'll just fake it."
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Well..."
Finn says: "hey, man, I think I see some, um..."
Finn says: "Sun People in trouble on the sun over there."
Jake says: "You makin' that up?"
Finn says: "Mmhmm."
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Let's do it!"
Finn says: "WHOO!"
Finn says: "WHOOOO!"
