The episode begins with Jake running through a field while eating out of a bowl of ice cream with Finn in pursuit.
Finn says: "Jake."
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Hey man, shouldn't we conserve our energy?"
Finn says: "The Ice Cream Marathon starts tomorrow."
Jake says: "I've been training for weeks."
Jake says: "And I am determined to eat more ice cream at the Ice Cream Marathon than anyone else!"
Finn says: "You sure like ice cream."
Jake says: "Ice cream is good!"
Strange croaking noise is heard off screen.
Jake says: "What the croak was that?"
Finn says: "It came from over there."
The two walk over to the source of the sound.
Finn says: "Whoa, Jake!"
Finn says: "Check it out!"
A old frog dressed in armor holding a staff is seen standing next to a small chest.
Finn says: "It's a brave little Gnome Knight."
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "That's a frog dressed up like a Gnome Knight."
Frog says: "Actually, I'm a Gnome Knight who was magically transformed into a frog."
Frog says: "And then I decided to continue being a knight."
Jake says: "And now you're, like, attracting a mate?"
Frog says: "No!"
Frog says: "I'm on the verge of death!"
Jake says: "Oh."
Jake says: "Well, you should just let go, man."
Finn says: "Yeah, you've had a good run."
Frog says: "No!"
Frog says: "I cannot die until I find a being whose spirit is brave and pure to take over my quest."
Finn says: "Quest?"
Jake says: "Uh-oh."
Jake says: "Somebody's gonna do a quest for a frog."
Finn says: "Tell me more about this..."
Finn says: "quest."
Frog says: "I have to guard  these magic beans."
Jake says: "Huh?"
Frog says: "Two of the beans are good, but one is horribly evil!"
Frog says: "I have no idea which is which."
Frog says: "So I've spent my life guarding them, preventing them from ever being planted."
Jake says: "Beans?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Ah ha ha!"
Jake says: "Magic beans..."
Jake says: "hee!"
Jake says: "We'll be right back."
Jake says: "Come on, Finn."
Jake says: "I think I dropped my spoon in the bush."
Finn says: "We will take your quest."
Frog says: "You will?"
Finn says: "Sure!"
Finn says: "Consider it guarded."
Frog says: "Also, take this."
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "Thanks."
Frog says: "No, thank you."
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Jake reenters scene.
Jake says: "Dude, what's goin' on?"
Finn says: "We took over the quest!"
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "The beans?"
Jake says: "Now wait a second!"
Gnome Knight says: "Nope, too late."
Finn says: "Ah, I miss him already."
Jake says: "Well, we should get a move on if we wanna make the Ice Cream Marathon."
Finn says: "What about the quest?"
Jake says: "Really?"
Jake says: "We have to do the bean quest?"
Finn says: "I gave him my word."
Jake says: "Yeah, I wasn't here for that, so..."
Jake says: "can't we guard the beans and eat ice cream?"
Finn says: "No, man!"
Finn says: "We're on the job."
Finn says: "And like you always say, "Work and fun don't mix..."
Jake says: ""..."
Jake says: "unless you're a clown."
Jake says: "" I do say that a lot."
Scene changes to Finn and Jake sitting next to the chest. Jake is sweating.
Jake says: "Gee, sittin' in this hot sun, guarding beans."
Jake says: "It sure beats 26 miles of vanilla ice cream."
Jake says: "Or caramel ice cream."
Jake says: "Or peach ice cream."
Jake says: "Hey, what if we plant the beans ourselves?"
Finn says: "That's a terrible idea."
Jake says: "No, wait, hear me out."
Jake says: "See,  if one of these beans is evil, then it's our duty to crush it, once and for all!"
Jake says: "Plus, two of the beans are good."
Jake says: "If we plant them, we'll be bringin' twice as much good into the world!"
Finn says: "And we can make it to the Ice Cream Marathon!"
Jake says: "I hadn't even thought about that!"
Ice Cream Marathon Song plays. Finn and Jake are shown planting the beans. Night falls.
Jake says: "I'm gonna take a cat nap."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "But we have to be ready for evil!"
Finn says: "Alright Finn, Jake's a lazy bum and this soil is ripe with evil."
Finn says: "I cannot go to sleep until that evil bean sprouts and is destroyed."
Scene switches to Finn and Jake sleeping. It is now morning. A large beanstalk starts growing and Finn wakes up.
Finn says: "AAAH!"
Finn says: "Wake up, Jake!"
Finn says: "This is it!"
Jake says: "Oh!"
Beanstalk stretches down a pod.
Finn says: "Aah!"
Finn says: "Bean pod!"
Finn says: "I can't tell if it's evil yet."
Bean pod opens, spilling out several piglets.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Baby Pigs dressed in silly costumes?"
Jake says: "Aw, look how cute they look all sleepy and snore-y."
Finn says: "Careful, Jake."
Finn says: "It could be a trap."
Finn says: "We should test them to see if they're..."
Finn says: "evil."
Scene changes to Finn handing a pencil and a test to each of the pigs who are sitting at desks.
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "Each one of you take one test and one pencil."
Finn says: "You have one hour to complete the test and prove we shouldn't kill you."
Finn says: "And begin."
Pigs are shown in various positions on or around their desks, squealing and snorting. One drops its pencil.
Jake says: "Aw, they're so cute they can hardly hold their pencils."
Finn says: "That doesn't fare well for their..."
Finn says: "grade point average."
Jake says: "Nothing evil could be this adorable."
Finn says: "nothing evil."
Finn says: "Okay, the pigs are good."
Jake says: "YES!"
Jake says: "You hear that, guys?"
Jake says: "You passed!"
Jake says: "A-plus!"
Jake says: "A-plus-plus!"
Another beanstalk grows out of the ground.
Finn says: "Oh, no!"
Finn says: "Jake, get ready."
Finn says: "The second pod is about to drop."
Finn says: "PROTECT THE PIGLETS!"
Jake says: "Stay back, babies!"
Second pod drops to the ground.
Finn says: "Show me what you have to offer, pod!"
Pod opens, spilling out magic wands.
Finn says: "Magical wands?"
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "COOL!"
Finn says: "Stop, Jake!"
Jake says: "WOW!"
Finn says: "Is it evil?"
Jake says: "It's a wand that poops glitter!"
Jake says: "What's good-er than that?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Hmm..."
Finn says: "Hahahaha!"
Finn says: "Glitter on its own could be evil."
Finn says: "But with rainbows?"
Finn says: "Over my dead body!"
Jake says: "Hey, let's have some fun with these pigs before the evil pod shows up!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Jake is shown playing pattycake with the pigs, Finn playing checkers with them, Finn and Jake pushing them in a tire swing, playing dodgeball, and building a log cabin.
Finn says: "Phew!"
Jake says: "I'm exhausted!"
Pigs fall asleep in Finn and Jake's arms.
Finn says: "They look so sleepy and peaceful."
Finn says: "We have to stay alert."
Finn says: "The evil pod could appear at any time."
Finn says: "When it does, we must be ready to destroy it immediately."
Jake says: "And then go to the Ice Cream Marathon, right?"
Finn says: "Yeah, man."
Jake says: "Okay."
Jake says: "I'll take the first shift."
Finn says: "Rhombus."
Scene changes, showing Finn and Jake still asleep. Finn and Jake awaken to see the third pod about to drop.
Finn says: "AH!"
Finn says: "Look!"
Finn says: "The third pod!"
Jake says: "It's bigger than the other two, dude!"
Finn says: "Yeah, man."
Finn says: "We've gotta kill it now."
The pod drops to the ground with a thud and Finn and Jake jump on top of it. Finn starts hitting it with his sword. Jake jumps off and punches near an opening.
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "It's squirting!"
Finn says: "Squirting?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "See?"
Jake says: "Squirting."
Jake says: "Right here."
Finn says: "Dang, man!"
Finn says: "Don't just lick stuff!"
Finn says: "It's evil!"
Finn says: "Is the evil sucking you in?"
Jake says: "That was awesome."
Finn says: "Are you poisoned?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Are you dying?"
Jake says: "No, man!"
Jake says: "It was awesome!"
Pod starts refilling itself.
Finn says: "Look, Jake!"
Finn says: "It's filling back up!"
Jake says: "Aw, yeah!"
Jake says: "This pod makes ice cream out of nothing!"
Jake says: "It's the "goodest" thing that's ever happened to me!"
Finn says: "Well, if this pod's not evil..."
Finn says: "."
Finn says: "The piglets are gone!"
Jake says: "And so are the fairy wands."
Screams are heard off screen.
Finn says: "Let's go!"
Finn says: "The screaming sounds are getting stronger near Mushroom Town!"
Pigs are seen attacking Mushroom People and their houses with wands. Finn and Jake arrive.
Finn says: "Piglets!"
Finn says: "Stop this!"
Pigs shoot rainbows from their wands at Finn and Jake. The rainbows hit Finn and Jake, launching them into the air. They land on their backs near the pods.
Finn says: "Oof!"
Jake says: "Oof!"
Finn says: "Cram!"
Finn says: "Now I must find these wicked piglets' weakness and use it to "retribuse" them."
Jake says: "Well, I found my weakness."
Finn says: "That's it!"
Finn says: "Ice cream!"
Jake says: "What about ice cream?"
Finn says: "Yes..."
Finn says: "yes!"
Finn says: "HA!"
Finn says: "The exams confirm my memory of the piglets being allergic to ice cream."
Jake says: "Just the thought of that scares me, man."
Finn and Jake carry the pod toward the Mushroom Village.
Finn says: "I see one of them!"
Finn says: "Get ready to release!"
Finn says: "RELEASE!"
Jake squeezes the pod, causing ice cream to squirt out and hit one of the pigs. The pig starts inflating until it bursts, showering Finn and Jake with flowers and hearts.
Jake says: "Ah, gross!"
Jake says: "That's--EW!"
Finn says: "Ah, gross man!"
Another pig shoots a rainbow at Jake with its wand, hitting him and causing him to fall over.
Finn says: "JAKE!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Jake, are you okay?"
Jake says: "Ahh, I can't stop dancing!"
Finn says: "Wha--?"
Jake says: "It must be the glitter!"
Jake says: "Oh, I really can't stop groovin'!"
Jake says: "It feels weird!"
Jake says: "Go on without me!"
Finn takes the pod and peeks around a corner. A pig shoots at him, narrowly missing.
Finn says: "YAAAAAAAAAH!"
The pig explodes and Finn squirts at another pig.
Finn says: ""Freezed" to meet you!"
Ice cream hits the pig. Finn turns to another pig and squeezes the pod.
Finn says: "Hope you saved room for dessert!"
Ice cream hits the pig and Finn continues running. He squirts ice cream at another pig.
Finn says: "Killing you with ice cream!"
Ice cream hits the pig. Finn stands on top of a mushroom house and squirts ice cream in all directions.
Jake says: "Whoo!"
Jake says: "Yeah, man!"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "There's one left..."
Finn says: "and I think he's trying to surrender."
Jake says: "Kill it!"
Finn says: "But he's dressed as a little construction worker!"
Finn says: "It's freakin' adorable."
Jake says: "He's tryin' to trick you!"
Jake says: "Kill it!"
Finn says: "I just don't know if I can bring myself to do it, Jake."
Pig squeals and shoots a rainbow at Finn. Finn squirts ice cream and the two streams meet and shoot up into the sky. The ice cream overtakes the rainbow and falls on the pig, who explodes and showers Finn, Jake, and three Mushroom People with flowers, hearts, bows, etc.
Mushroom Mayor says: "Why, thank you, Finn and Jake, for sort of saving our village."
Finn says: "You're sort of welcome."
Mushroom Mayor says: "Now if you'll excuse us, we need to start removing all of this ice cream from our homes and businesses."
Jake says: "Not so fast!"
Jake says: "I'll take it from here, folks."
Finn says: "He likes ice cream."
Mushroom Village is shown sparkling clean. Jake returns.
Finn says: "Haha, nice job, tubby."
Finn says: "But save room for the Ice Cream Marathon."
Jake says: "I've always got room for ice cream, Finn."
Jake says: "You know that, man!"
Jake says: "Ugh, I'm going to the Ice Cream Marathon."
Finn says: "He just really likes ice cream."
Mushroom Mayor says: "Oh."
