The episode begins with Finn and Jake having a picnic and watching the sunset.
Jake says: "Hey, man, it's Couples Only Movie Night tonight."
Jake says: "Who are you bringin'?"
Finn says: "I don't know."
Finn says: "Who are you bringin'?"
Jake says: "I'm bringing my girlfriend, dude."
Finn says: "Oh."
A duck walks up to them and Finn picks it up.
Finn says: "I'll take this duck!"
Jake says: "It's couples night!"
Jake says: "You gotta bring someone you can smooch."
Finn says: "Man, I don't want to be smooched!"
Jake says: "Don't have to smooch."
Jake says: "You just have to bring someone you can smooch."
Jake says: "It's, like, the rules."
Finn says: "Lame."
Jake says: "Put the blanket down."
Jake says: "Have a seat."
Jake says: "I want to explain some "things" to you about couples."
Later that day, Finn and Jake are back at the treehouse. Finn is looking for someone to call.
Jake says: "You all square?"
Finn says: "Yeah, yeah."
Jake says: "Who you gonna call?"
Finn says: "I'm going to call a girl I don't have to kiss."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hello?"
Finn says: "Hi Princess!"
Finn says: "Would you go to Couples Movie Night with me?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Sounds romantic, Finn."
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "I was just wondering if you wanted to go with me."
Princess Bubblegum says: "No, sorry, Finn."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm busy practicing for the Whistling Choir Death Match Championship."
Finn says: "But—"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Auf Wiedersehen!"
Hangs up phone and begins to practice her whistling.
Finn says: "She doesn't want to go!"
Jake says: "Yes she does!"
Jake says: "We just need to help her realize that she wants to go to the movies with you."
Jake says: "I'm calling Marceline."
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "Look, man, I've been learning a lot about vampires lately."
Jake says: "I realized my fear was based on ignorance!"
Marceline answers her phone, half of the screen Jake and half the screen of Marceline.
Marceline says: "Speak."
Jake says: "Hey, hey, Marceline."
Jake says: "Got a favor to ask, Babe."
Jake says: "We've gotta make Princess Bubblegum jealous, so she'll go to the movies with Finn."
Finn says: "Hehe."
Finn says: "Are you gonna help us?"
Marceline says: "Yeah, I'll help."
Marceline says: "It'll be funny."
Now at the Candy Kingdom.
Jake says: "Okay, so here's the plan."
Jake says: "."
Jake says: "Which will awaken her Finn love!"
Jake says: "You start us off."
Finn says: "Um..."
Finn says: "hmm funny..."
Finn says: "funny..."
Finn says: "giddy up?"
Marceline bursts out laughing.
Finn says: "Hehe."
Finn says: "Um..."
Finn says: "diggy diggy?"
Marceline laughs even more, very exaggerated.
Finn says: "Diggy diggy!"
Finn says: "Diggy diggy!"
Princess Bubblegum appears at window and clears throat.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Greetings, Finn."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hey, Marceline..."
Marceline says: "Hello, Bonnibel."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yeah, yeah."
Princess Bubblegum says: "So, what's so funny, Finn?"
Finn says: "I, um..."
Finn says: "uh..."
Finn says: "it's..."
Finn says: "something."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Well, then, keep it down out there!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm trying to whistle practice!"
Jake says: "That was great!"
Jake says: "Now, we begin Phase 2!"
Jake says: "It's so powerful!"
Jake says: "Wait here!"
Jake says: "Hehehe..."
Marceline says: "Hey, look, Finn, I know Jake's your friend and all, but..."
Marceline says: "if you really want Bubblegum to go to the movies with you, you've gotta like, stop taking advice from your dog and take some advice from a real girl!"
Finn says: "But Jake said Phase 2 is powerful!"
Marceline says: "How is Jake going to know what girls want more than a real girl?"
Finn says: "Yeah..."
Marceline says: "Okay great."
Marceline says: "So what we need now is something..."
Marceline says: "fun!"
Marceline says: "Girls love fun more than anything."
Marceline says: "Fun, fun, fun!"
Marceline says: "If you can show Princess Bubblegum you're fun, she'll deffs wanna go to the movies with you."
Finn says: "Haha, you said fun so much, it sounds all weird now."
Finn says: "Fun."
Finn says: "F—"
Marceline says: "So..."
Marceline says: "what do you like to do for fun, Finn?"
Finn says: "Oh, Oh!"
Finn says: "I like to wrestle!"
Finn says: "And fight!"
Finn says: "But girls don't like that."
Marceline says: "No, no, that's perfect!"
Marceline says: "All you need to do is get in there and wrestle Princess Bubblegum to show her how fun you are."
Finn says: "Ffffffuuunnn."
Finn says: "Ffffuuunn."
Jake says: "Whoa, where you going, man?"
Jake says: "Check it out!"
Finn says: "What is that stuff?"
Jake says: "It's a lute-suit!"
Jake says: "Girls love it!"
Jake says: "Trust me."
Now in the hallway outside of Princess Bubblegum's bedroom, Finn is dressed in the lute-suit and Jake is shaped-changed into a chair. Marceline floats down from the ceiling.
Marceline says: "Finn!"
Marceline says: "What the plum are you wearing?"
Marceline says: "You look horrible!"
Jake says: "It's a lute-suit!"
Jake says: "And Finn looks adorable in it!"
Marceline says: "Well, it's going to ruin the plan."
Jake says: "What she talking about, Finn?"
Finn says: "Well..."
Finn says: "I was going to give Marceline's plan a try, too."
Jake says: "Her idea?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "What's wrong with my idea?"
Princess Bubblegum is heard whistling and walks into the hallway, Jake turns back into a chair and Marceline turns into a bat and flies away.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, hey, Finn!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Did'ya ever find some—"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Whoa!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "What are you wearing?"
Finn says: "Oh..."
Finn says: "this is my..."
Finn says: "Lute..."
Finn says: "suit."
Jake points down at lute he stretched and motions for him to play it.
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "This is my lute-suit!"
Marcelince says: "Psst!"
Finn says: "Oh, yeah!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Guards!"
Finn is thrown out of the castle. Jake comes out of the hole in the lute, breaking the strings and falls, dizzy. Marceline sits down next to him and turns back to normal.
Marceline says: "That suit was ridiculous."
Jake says: "Ridi—"
Jake says: "Ridiculous?"
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "Can you believe this girl, Finn?"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Can ya?"
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "I guess the suit did feel..."
Finn says: "a little silly."
Jake says: "Well, fine!"
Jake says: "You can just give it back then!"
Finn take off suit.
Finn says: "I'm sorry!"
Jake says: "Good luck getting to that movie without my help!"
Jake says: "Ruff."
Marceline says: "Gee, he seems pretty ticked."
Finn says: "Naw, he just needs some spaghetti."
Marceline says: "Oh, okay."
Marceline says: "Well taste this, then."
Marceline says: "I've gotta a new plan."
Finn says: "Really?"
Marceline says: "The only thing women like more than fun is excitement!"
Marceline says: "She needs to feel her blood pump, man!"
Marceline says: "She needs to..."
Marceline says: "be chased by wolves!"
Finn says: "Like metaphorically?"
Marceline says: "Come on, I'll teach ya how to show a girl a good time."
Marceline says: "Wraps Finn's arms around her."
Marceline says: "] Hold tight."
Marceline says: "You ready?"
Finn says: "Uhh..."
Finn says: "Mhmm."
Marceline takes off and laughs. They fly above a pack of running wolves and start to run with them. Marceline stops and growls at Finn until he begins to growl back and run on all fours. Finn & Marceline begin to run with the wolves, foam coming out of Finn's mouth and howl at the moon with them. Marceline bites the back of the wolf in front of her and Finn does the same. Finn and Marceline begin to ride on the back of two wolves. Marceline and Finn fly two wolves to the Candy Kingdom and outside of Princess Bubblegum's room.
Marceline says: "Shhh!"
Marceline says: "She's probably asleep!"
They put the wolves into Princess Bubblegum's room and close the door.
Finn says: "This was a really good idea."
Marceline says: "Now don't blow it this time!"
Finn says: "Haha, okay."
Princess Bubblegum screams, runs out of her room and struggles to close the door behind her. She notices Finn.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, Finn, thank goodness you're here!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "There's wolves in my room!"
Finn says: "Yeah, I know!"
Finn says: "I put them there!"
Finn says: "Pretty exciting, right?"
Finn says: "Heh heh."
Banana Guards drag Finn out of the castle.
Finn says: "I don't understand, Marceline."
Finn says: "I tried everything."
Finn says: "I guess she just doesn't like me."
Marceline says: "Shhh."
Marceline says: "Come on, Finn, a brainlord like Bonnie?"
Marceline says: "You'll be bored with her in a week!"
Marceline says: "And anyway I, for one, think you're pretty great."
Finn says: "Marceline!"
Finn says: "Of course!"
Finn says: "It's been Marceline all along!"
Jake says: "Hey, man, I've been looking for you."
Jake says: "Sorry for acting like a dweeb before."
Jake says: "Want some leftover spaghetti?"
Finn says: "Ah, no, thanks, man."
Finn says: "But I really need your help!"
Jake says: "'Bout time!"
Marceline is at her house and is about to play her bass, when she hears a lute playing outside. She looks out the window and she's Finn dressed in the lute-suit.
Marceline says: "Uh-oh."
Finn says: "Marceline!"
Finn says: "Will you go to the movies with me?!"
Finn says: "!"
Marceline opens door.
Marceline says: "We need to talk..."
Finn and Jake walk in.
Finn says: "Good evening my dear, your escort is here!"
Marceline says: "Finn, you do NOT want to go down that road with me."
Finn says: "With you, I would walk down any road, m'lady."
Finn says: "Especially, if it leads to the movies."
Marceline says: "Oh, yeah?"
Marceline says: "No one would want to go to the movies with..."
Marceline says: "What do you think of me now?"
Finn says: "How do you like your popcorn?"
Marceline says: "Uuugh!"
Marceline says: "You're starting to annoy me!"
Finn says: "Well then let's do something fun, like go to the movies!"
Marceline says: "Get off me!"
Marceline says: "Finn, I like you, but I—"
Finn says: "Headlock!"
Marceline says: "No!"
Marceline says: "Listen to me."
Marceline says: "I'm not going to go to the movies with you!"
Marceline says: "I just don't like you..."
Marceline says: "that way."
Finn lies down on the couch, sad.
Marceline says: "I'm sorry Finn, I just..."
Marceline says: "I don't wanna date you."
Finn says: "Date me?"
Finn says: "Man, I just wanna go to the movies."
Finn says: "But everybody hates me."
Marceline says: "Wait, you don't want me to be your girlfriend?"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "Movies!"
Marceline says: "If you weren't looking for a girlfriend then why were you romancing it up all day?"
Finn says: "'Cause Jake said Couples Night had weird kissing requirements and romance initiation rituals and whatever else."
Jake says: "I didn't really say all that."
Marceline says: "Of course I'll go with you, Finn!"
Finn says: "You will?"
Marceline says: "Yeah, as friends."
Finn says: "Of course as friends!"
Marceline says: "But no tongue."
Finn says: "Yea—"
Finn says: "Wha?"
Marceline and Finn are at Couples Movie Night, sitting on an old truck and watching the intros.
Finn says: "Oh, man!"
Finn says: "I can't believe I'm finally going to see this movie!"
The movie "Love Kaboom" starts with a woman and man.
Woman in movie says: "Oh, mon cher."
Woman in movie says: "I guess zese is goodbye."
Finn is getting weirded out by the movie.
Man in movie says: "No, not goodbye."
Man in movie says: "Let's say: Farewell!"
Jake and Lady Rainicorn, Lollipop Girl & Ice Cream Guy are kissing, and so are two bugs in Ice Cream Guy's head. Finn sees all of this and throws up and turns to Marceline, who is also grossed out.
Finn says: "Couples Night sucks!"
Finn says: "Marceline, would you do me the honor, of getting the plop out of here?"
Marceline says: "There's nothing I'd like more."
Man in movie says: "Nothing can ever tear us apart."
Finn tears through the screen and rides off with Marceline on running wolves.
Episode ends.
