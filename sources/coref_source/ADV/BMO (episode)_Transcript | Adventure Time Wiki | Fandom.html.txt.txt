The episode starts with beeping and whirring, as well as the inside views of BMO.
BMO says: "Did you know there are more stars in the sky than there are grains of sand in the sky?"
BMO says: "It’s true."
BMO says: "This is a rare asteroid made entirely of heavy metal."
BMO says: "His name is Lars Darksaber."
BMO says: "I don’t know any of these guys."
BMO says: "Whoa!"
BMO says: "Look at that big boy go!"
BMO says: "That’s gonna be the biggest comet I ever did I –  I wrote this song for my hat!"
BMO says: "♪ Some people say that space is lonely: silent, empty, sparkling, and immense."
BMO says: "But wide open spaces put smiles on cowboy faces, even when they’re stuck inside their tents."
BMO says: "Yes, I’ve got my mission to distract me, from friendly folds I had to leave back home."
BMO says: "And I’ve got my potatoes more exciting than tornadoes; potatoes, potatoes, buy my fresh potatoes!"
A sound of crack interrupts BMO singing. Soon, BMO’s spacecraft is pelted by raining meteoroids. BMO screams until the pelt stops.
BMO says: "Anybody get mashed?"
BMO climbs back to the seat and finds out a crack nearby is propagating. It starts to suck air out.
BMO says: "Alert!"
BMO says: "Alert!"
Some potatoes fly by and block the crack.
BMO says: "Time to make the doughnuts."
BMO says: "Boy, that meteoroid storm was scary."
BMO says: "There probably won’t be scary cool things on Mars."
BMO says: "It will just be me, alone."
Football says: "You’ll always have me, BMO."
BMO says: "Yes Football, but I meant new interesting people."
Football frowns.
BMO says: "♪ I've left my dream of grand adventure..."
A floating potato awakes a sentient, green being, and it approaches BMO's spacecraft.
BMO says: "Hi!"
The object shapeshifts and waves.
BMO says: "You can stretch!"
BMO says: "Do you talk?"
The object buzzes.
BMO says: "Hmm."
BMO says: "Well, you're round and green, so I'm going to call you Olive."
BMO says: "After my favorite type of bread."
BMO says: "My name is BMO!"
Olive starts to scan BMO's body, which makes him giggles, and then Olive turns into an exclamation mark.
BMO says: "You like what you see, huh?"
BMO says: "You got the good taste."
Olive wraps the body over the spacecraft.
BMO says: "Huh?"
BMO says: "What are you doing?"
Olive controls the spacecraft, which blasts in a hyper speed and passes by Mars.
BMO says: "Ah!"
BMO says: "That was Mars!"
BMO says: "We are going the wrong way!"
BMO says: "Olive!"
BMO says: "So trippy!"
The spacecraft reappears outside the atmosphere of an alien planet. BMO detects his surroundings.
BMO says: "Oh no no no!"
BMO says: "The stars are all jacked!"
BMO says: "Olive!"
BMO says: "You interfered with my mission!"
BMO says: "Okay I changed my mind!"
BMO says: "You can interfere, Olive!"
BMO says: "Please!"
The spacecraft proceeds as the scene goes dark. Cut to a scene in the desert, where a machine is being observed by a humanoid rabbit, Y4, who is recording her observation.
Y4 says: "15 minutes have elapsed."
Y4 says: "Subject continues to struggle like a dum-dum."
Y4 says: "Its attempts are pitiful."
Y4 says: "But I am sworn not to interfere."
KS-2 says: "Y4, report!"
Y4 says: "I found a weird bug bot on a rock."
KS-2 says: "Ah, Hugo's not gonna care about that."
KS-2 says: "Don't come back until you find something useful."
Y4 says: "Yes, ma'am."
A group of Elf people run near Y4 and she decides to follow them. It turns out that a conflict between two species is about to happen.
Y4 says: "This is great!"
Y4 says: "New entry."
Y4 says: "Gray Elves and Shell People are squaring off over a newly excavated site."
Y4 says: "But which side will prevail?"
Y4 says: "Do the less-dominant Shells fail to grasp the importance of the Elves' unity mission?"
Cole says: "Elves!"
Cole says: "By the laws of the Drift, we assert our claim to this very sweet photon transmogger."
Shafter says: "Heck, no, Cole."
Shafter says: "The transmogger belongs to Mr."
Shafter says: "M."
Shafter says: "I have the receipt."
Shafter says: "From you."
Shafter says: "You sold it, man."
Cole says: "That never happened!"
Cole says: "And/or I don't remember doing it!"
Shafter says: "WE need that part!"
Shafter says: "I challenge you to a drift duel."
Shafter says: "One-on-one, Cole."
Shafter says: "Last man standing gets the transmogger, AKA me."
Cole says: "Oh, you think you're so tough with your lava blaster."
Cole says: "But it's no match for my..."
Cole says: "stink sacs!"
Y4 says: "Such a rare and majestic sight."
Shafter says: "Ew!"
Shafter says: "No, thank you."
Cole says: "Ooh, stink you right up."
Shafter says: "On the count of five."
Shafter says: "One, two, thr..."
Shafter says: "Now, Lenny Longlegs!"
Lenny Longlegs runs swiftly to the photon transmogger.
Cole says: "Hey, you're cheating!"
Y4 says: "This is it!"
Lenny Longlegs says: "Ha, ha!"
Lenny Longlegs says: "The Elves stand victorious ag..."
BMO's spacecraft crashes in through the wall and destroys the photon transmogger in the process.
Cole says: "It's ruined!"
Elves says: "No!"
Shells says: "No!"
Elves says: "No!"
Shells says: "No!"
Elves says: "No!"
Shells says: "No!"
Elves says: "No!"
Shells says: "No!"
Elves says: "Aaaaah!"
Shells says: "Aaaaah!"
Elves says: "Aaaaah!"
Shells says: "Aaaaah!"
Elves says: "Aaaaah!"
Shells says: "Aaaaah!"
Elves says: "Aaaaah!"
Shells says: "Aaaaah!"
Two group grown in agony as BMO climbs out from the ruins, fake-crying as his left arm broken, catching their attention.
BMO says: "Phew!"
BMO says: "I thought that I was toast bread for sure."
BMO says: "But I'm completely uninjured!"
BMO says: "Lucky I didn't crash into anything important."
The smoking transmogger shatters, shown by the two grunting species.
BMO says: "Ha!"
BMO says: "You weird babies."
BMO says: "That's nothing to cry about."
BMO says: "It's just garbage trash."
Shafter says: "Shelves!"
Shafter says: "I..."
Shafter says: "Ugh, I mean Elves and Shells, I propose a truce."
Shafter says: "Let us put aside our conflict."
BMO says: "Good babies."
Shafter says: "Let us join our forces, and together, united, destroy that little robot!"
BMO says: "What?"
Y4 says: "Oh, no."
Elves and Shells shout and charge at BMO.
Elves says: "Get him!"
Shells says: "Get him!"
Elves says: "After the robot!"
Shells says: "After the robot!"
BMO says: "But I'm so cute."
BMO is taken away by Y4, who flees immediately.
Elves says: "Huh?"
Shells says: "Huh?"
Shafter says: "Get them!"
BMO says: "You're a rabbit!"
Elves says: "Get him!"
Shells says: "Get him!"
Elves says: "Aaah!"
Shells says: "Aaah!"
Y4 runs for her lives with her boots as she is almost shot by lava blaster.
Y4 says: "Aah!"
BMO says: "They have terrible aim."
BMO says: "Keep both eyes open!"
Y4 says: "Robot, what the heck?"
Y4 says: "Cheese, I'm in trouble!"
Cole says: "We'll go around!"
Cole says: "Hup!"
Y4 screams as she falls from a cliff but her boots' function saves her; she continues to run and feels nauseous about the smell at the same time.
Y4 says: "Blah, why did I interfere?"
Y4 says: "Oh, stupid, stupid, stupid!"
BMO gets up inside Y4's backpack, seeing the creatures after them.
BMO says: "Tantrum babies."
Y4 runs through a crowded market as Elves destroy a statue next to the entry.
Y4 says: "Aah!"
Y4 says: "S-Sorry!"
Y4 says: "Sorry!"
Y4 says: "Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!"
Y4 says: "Don't hate me!"
Y4 escapes through a hole in a structure, and Cole tries to catch up her.
Cole says: "Move over!"
Cole says: "I'm stuck."
Shafter then goes to his superior instead, who is in a vehicle.
Shafter says: "Mr."
Shafter says: "M?"
Mr. M says: "Well?"
Mr. M says: "Where's the transmogger?"
Shafter says: "Some little bot came outta nowhere a-and trashed it."
Shafter says: "But we'll track him down, sir."
Mr. M says: "Forget him!"
Mr. M says: "Go back and see if you can salvage the pieces."
Shafter says: "Shouldn't we report this to Hugo?"
Mr. M says: "Oh!"
Mr. M says: "No need to worry."
Mr. M says: "I'll take care of that personally."
Y4 head to her place with BMO.
Y4 says: "Field log, supplementary."
Y4 says: "After, uh, thoughtful consideration, I've scientifically decided to take the alien robot in for further study, scientifically."
BMO sees some flying Space Lards in the sky.
BMO says: "So beautiful!"
BMO says: "More Olives?"
Y4 says: "Finally!"
BMO says: "Huh?"
BMO says: "Where are we?"
Y4 says: "My secret lab."
BMO says: "A secret lab?"
BMO says: "A secret lab!"
BMO says: "It's just how I've always pictured it, for the last two minutes."
Y4 says: "There's gotta be an "off" switch somewhere."
BMO says: "Aah!"
BMO says: "Don't look at my bottom!"
Y4 says: "It can simulate embarrassment."
Y4 says: "Its maker must have been a weirdo."
BMO says: "I'm a self-made man."
BMO says: "But who are you?"
Y4 says: "You can call me Y4, if you must."
BMO says: "No, that's boring."
BMO says: "I will call you Harmonica."
Y4 says: "I don't like that."
Y4 says: "It's funny, though."
Y4 says: "I have thought about calling myself something else."
BMO says: "Yeah, that's what I did."
BMO says: "I called myself BMO, and the rest is history."
Y4 says: "Really?"
Y4 says: "'Cause it looks like it's just printed on your side there."
BMO says: "Okay, thank you."
BMO says: "Pick a name now."
Y4 says: "Okay."
Y4 says: "Hypothetically, how about Wiiii..."
Y4 says: "Five?"
BMO says: "I love it!"
Y5 says: "Y5 will take care of that."
Y5 says: "I feel great about this new name."
Y5 says: "Begin science log."
Y5 says: "The alien robot entity's arm node seems to be attached by a galaxy standard bolt."
Y5 says: "There we go."
Y5 says: "Good as new."
BMO says: "Hello, BMO."
Y5 says: "I guess I gotta knock you out now."
Y5 says: "For science."
Olive, outside Y5's lab, watching the process all along, zooms in the lab, slapping Y5's hand and try to protect BMO.
Y5 says: "Oh."
Y5 says: "He's yours?"
Olive nods.
BMO says: "BMO is his own big boy, thank you."
Y5 says: "That old maintenance droid seems to think you're important."
BMO says: "Olive?"
BMO says: "She's a no-good-for-nothing troublemaker."
BMO says: "Don't give me that puppy eye!"
Y5 says: "Serious?"
Y5 says: "What's the worst a li'l robot can do?"
The scene cuts to the place where the spacecraft crashed.
Shafter says: "You know, you guys don't really have to hang around."
Cole says: "Pssh!"
Cole says: "That dang robot has to come back to this ship eventually."
Cole says: "Bob, do you have any threes?"
Bob says: "Uh, go fish."
Bob says: "My winning hand!"
Cole says: "I got a bad feeling."
BMO's spacecraft is pushed out by the air pressure; the air leak almost sucks Elves and Shells away, who grab on the ground, struggling. An alarm starts beeping.
BMO says: "Woop, woop, woop, woop!"
BMO says: "I hear that everywhere I go."
Y5 says: "The atmosphere is getting sucked out of the breach!"
Y5 says: "We need to vacate this pod!"
BMO says: "No, I need my ship!"
Y5 says: "Your ship is long gone!"
BMO says: "Lead the way, lady."
Cole says: "I do not like this!"
BMO says: "Come on, Y5!"
BMO says: "Toward the screaming!"
Y5 says: "But that's not what I do!"
BMO says: "It's what I do - sometimes."
Olive joins BMO and turns into a hoverboard to carry him.
BMO says: "Hooray!"
BMO says: "I can't stay mad at you, magic skateboard."
BMO says: "Come on, Y5!"
Y5 eventually follow them, with her boots in the super-gravity mode.
Y5 says: "Against all rational thought, the intrepid researcher returns to the breach to..."
Y5 says: "Holy!"
Shells says: "Help!"
Elves says: "Help!"
Cole says: "Ooh, look at those legs waggle!"
BMO says: "Gimme the blowtorch!"
Shafter says: "No!"
Shafter says: "Mine!"
Shafter says: "Oh, no!"
BMO and the elf both lose balance and start to drift with the air.
BMO says: "Ahhh!"
Shafter says: "Ahhh!"
BMO says: "Ahhh!"
Shafter says: "Ahhh!"
Y5 boosts her boot to save them, reaching BMO.
BMO says: "Oh!"
Shafter says: "Hey, wait."
BMO says: "He died as he lived..."
BMO says: "sucking big time."
BMO says: "Crab guy!"
BMO says: "Crab guy!"
BMO says: "You need to throw your shields all at once!"
Cole says: "Uh, no."
Cole says: "Why would I?"
BMO says: "Because BMO has a mission."
Cole says: "Shells, throw your shields when the green box commands!"
BMO says: "Now!"
BMO says: "Easy like potato pie."
Y5 says: "BMO, that was incredible."
Y5 says: "You single-handedly saved everyone!"
The scene briefly cuts to Shafter in the space, unamused. Y5 sends a message away about BMO.
BMO says: "Olive."
BMO says: "Okay."
BMO says: "I know what you're all thinking."
BMO says: "With my ship gone, I am trapped here."
BMO says: "So, yes, I will save your terrible land."
BMO says: "It does need saving, correct?"
Cole says: "Yes."
BMO says: "Very well."
BMO says: "Then I appoint myself your new sheriff."
BMO says: "Now, show me where the trouble is!"
Y5 says: "Well, there's a lot of trouble in the drift."
BMO says: "Woof."
BMO says: "Looks like I'm gonna need a deputy."
BMO says: "I can't pay you."
[Y5 checks her beeping messages says: ""Bring it in immediately."
which is a reply says: ""Bring it in immediately."
[Y5 checks her beeping messages says: "Maintain secrecy!!!"
which is a reply says: "Maintain secrecy!!!"
Y5 says: "BMO..."
Y5 says: "you've just been summoned to..."
Y5 says: "meet some very influential citizens."
BMO says: "That's great!"
BMO says: "It will give me a chance to check out my new stomping grounds."
Y5 says: "Great!"
Y5 and BMO walks together leaving the desert.
BMO says: "Back home, I'd only walk this far by accident."
Y5 says: "What was the name of your home world again?"
BMO says: "It is far from here."
BMO says: "A little blue-and-green planet called BMO World."
Y5 says: "..."
Y5 says: "Never heard of it."
Y5 says: "Phew!"
Y5 says: "Aah."
Y5 says: "I need to make a pit stop."
They come to a vending machine.
BMO says: "Oh, my goodness!"
BMO says: "Hello, big cousin!"
Voice from the Machine says: "Welcome, driftgoer."
Y5 says: "It's just a Hugomat."
Y5 says: "They're literally everywhere."
The Hugomat produces a bottle of drink instantly.
BMO says: "Cool!"
Voice from the Machine says: "Your..."
Voice from the Machine says: "sports energy drink is ready."
Y5 says: "Whew!"
BMO says: "Energy drinks."
BMO says: "The future is amazing."
They enter a large building.
BMO says: "Golly."
BMO says: "Did you make all of this?"
Y5 says: "No."
Y5 says: "I didn't personally build an ancient space station."
BMO says: "Whoa!"
A Parrot Vendor says: "Buy my eggs!"
A Parrot Vendor says: "Buy my eggs!"
A Parrot Vendor says: "Or I swear to glob I'll eat them myself!"
BMO says: "Hey, check out this hothouse mess."
Y5 says: "Nobody goes into Jungle Pod."
Y5 says: "The life forms have all mutated into strange and dangerous things."
Y5 says: "Come on."
BMO says: "I will play with you, strange things."
They walk past through a Hugomat, where two bugs are entering.
Darling says: "Dude, climb with your legs, not your arms."
Sweetie says: "I'm getting tired!"
Darling says: "We're almost there, Sweetie!"
Darling says: "Come on!"
BMO says: "What are you up to?"
Darling says: "Uh, well, hello, there, Sheriff BMO."
Darling says: "My brother and I are just, uh, climbing up to the coin slot of this Hugomat for some, uh, exercise."
Sweetie says: "We love fitness!"
BMO says: "You two sound like some fishy four flushers."
BMO says: "I've got my eye on you..."
BMO says: "fishies!"
Darling says: "I'm so scared."
Y5 and BMO arrives in a space grazing land; one of the farmers is tooting.
BMO says: "What's wrong, partner?"
Farmer says: "Hey, you're that new guy who's all over the inter-pod streams."
BMO says: "Yes, I'm famous."
BMO says: "Now tell us why you're crying, ugly man."
Farmer says: "Well, it's one of my baby space lards."
Farmer says: "It won't come back in from stargrazin'."
Farmer says: "Which is what I call grazin'."
The said space lard is flying in turns, outside the shield.
BMO says: "They look so cold and scared!"
BMO says: "BMO lasso!"
BMO uses Olive as a lasso and pulls back the space lard to the farmer.
Farmer says: "Man, I don't know what I would have done if this tender little baby had frozen..."
Farmer says: "before I could eat it."
BMO says: "What?!"
BMO says: "!"
BMO says: "You want in on this?"
BMO says: "I make my own sauce."
BMO says: "In my sauce gland."
BMO says: "No!"
BMO says: "I saved this lard."
BMO says: "You will repay me by caring for him and keeping him safe forever."
BMO says: "Also, his name is Ricky!"
Farmer says: "Yaa!"
Farmer says: "Yes, sir."
BMO says: "Gimme that!"
Y5 says: "This robot expends energy in ways that yield it no benefit."
Y5 says: "So weird."
BMO says: "Deputy, carry this."
BMO says: "I don't have pockets."
They continue moving. On their way, the ground starts to shake; the gravity suddenly reverses and everyone screams as they're thrown up.
Y5 says: "It's another gravity outage!"
Y5 changes the mode of her boots and she's horizontally thrown to a wasteland; screaming until she lands.
Y5 says: "Blooey."
BMO says: "This station is trash."
BMO says: "I've got my work cut out for me."
Y5 says: "Don't worry."
Y5 says: "Hugo's got a plan to fix things."
BMO says: "Who's Hugo?"
CGO says: ""♪ Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-callin' tossed salads and scrambled eggs."
CGO says: "♪" Oh, my."
CGO says: ""♪ And maybe I seem a bit confused..."
BMO says: "I think I know this song."
CGO says: "♪ But I got you pegged..."
Y5 says: "Forget about that old robot."
Y5 says: "We've got a mission, remember?"
CGO says: "Good night, Seattle!"
CGO says: "We love you!"
Y5 says: "01110000, 01100001, 01110011, 01110011, 01110111, 01101111, 01110010, 01100100."
A transporter appears from the ground before Y5 and they get in.
BMO says: "Who are we going to see again?"
BMO says: "I forgot."
BMO says: "Bunnies!"
BMO says: "So many bunnies!"
BMO says: "Haha, this one runs a hotel!"
Y5's Dad says: "..."
Y5's Dad says: "if he's impressed with it, our place on the Unity Pod is a lock."
KS-2 says: "If Y4's data isn't flawed..."
KS-2 says: "Which, you know..."
Y5 says: "Um, I'm back."
Y5 says: "Mom?"
Y5 says: "Dad?"
Y5 says: "Come look what I found."
Y5's Dad says: "Oh, my brain!"
Y5's Dad says: "A functioning service droid!"
Y5's Dad says: "I haven't seen one of these in forever."
Y5 says: "Mom, let me introduce you to..."
BMO says: "Howdy, Mom!"
BMO says: "Nice to meet..."
KS-2 opens BMO straight and pushes the off button. Olive pokes inactive BMO.
KS-2 says: "There's bound to be useful U-Pod parts in here."
Y5's Dad says: "We should call Mr."
Y5's Dad says: "M!"
Y5 says: "I did good, right?"
Y5 says: "These are some great..."
Y5 says: "parts."
The ground shakes again, with alarm.
KS-2 says: "Another failure?"
Y5's Dad says: "It's in Communications Pod!"
KS-2 says: "There's never been one this close before!"
Y5's Dad says: "What do we do?"
Y5 says: "BMO likes alarms."
KS-2 says: "Y4, hush!"
KS-2 says: "The adults are talking."
Olive reactivates BMO.
BMO says: "..."
BMO says: "Eet you!"
BMO says: "Huh?"
Y5 says: "BMO!"
Y5 says: "There's a pod in danger."
BMO says: "Let's ride!"
KS-2 says: "Y4!"
KS-2 says: "What about Mr."
KS-2 says: "M?"
Y5 says: "Don't worry."
Y5 says: "I'll watch over the, uh, parts."
Y5 and BMO run to the Communication Pod, where things are collapsing and flooding. Sweetie and his brother are still stealing things from a Hugomat.
Darling says: "Come on, keep printing stuff we can heist this thing with."
Y5 says: "We gotta bail!"
BMO says: "Wait!"
BMO says: "It's our duty to evacuate the citizens."
BMO says: "I will save you, weird duck!"
Duck says: "I'm fine!"
BMO jumps into the water, causing a short circuit.
Y5 says: "Aah!"
Y5 says: "Robots can't go in the water!"
BMO says: "Fine!"
BMO says: "You are my arms and legs."
BMO says: "Now help me get everyone to safety!"
A Feet Creature says: "Excuse me."
A Feet Creature says: "We're too small and stupid to save ourselves."
BMO says: "Don't worry, Bumbos."
A device falls and crashes behind them.
Feet Creatures says: "Uh-oh."
Feet Creatures says: "Uh-oh."
Feet Creatures says: "Uh-oh."
Feet Creatures says: "Uh-oh."
Feet Creatures says: "Uh-oh."
BMO says: "Shush!"
BMO says: "Hey, use your big brain and think of another way out of here."
Y5 says: "Um..."
Y5 says: "Oh!"
Y5 says: "There's another hatch over this way."
Feet Creatures says: "Hop, hop, hop, hop."
Feet Creatures says: "Hop, hop, hop, hop."
Feet Creatures says: "Hop, hop, hop, hop."
Y5 says: "Through here."
Feet Creatures says: "Hop, hop, hop, hop."
A Feet Creature says: "Wait, I think I forgot something."
A Feet Creature says: "Can I go back?"
BMO says: "Get out!"
A Feet Creature says: "Okay."
Sweetie says: "Sheriff!"
Darling says: "Sheriff!"
Sweetie says: "We messed up!"
Darling says: "We messed up!"
Sweetie says: "Aaaaah!"
Darling says: "Aaaaah!"
Sweetie and Darling are trapped in the Hugomat and are flushing away.
BMO says: "You can swim, right?"
Y5 says: "Yes, but badly."
BMO says: "Giddy up!"
Y5 says: "Ow!"
Y5 says: "H-Hello?"
KS-2 says: "Y4!"
KS-2 says: "Where are you?!"
KS-2 says: "!"
KS-2 says: "Mr."
KS-2 says: "M is on his way to pick up that unit for dismemberment."
Y5 says: "Heading back now!"
Y5 says: "Aaaah!"
KS-2 says: "What's going on?"
A tide almost flushes them away, while the crack on the ceiling propagates allowing more water flooding in.
Sweetie says: "Aaaah!"
Darling says: "Aaaah!"
Sweetie says: "Get me outta here!"
Darling says: "Get me outta here!"
BMO says: "Y5, chew through the glass with your big, nasty teeth."
BMO says: "Huh?"
BMO says: "Yay, Olive!"
BMO says: "Swing!"
BMO says: "Swing now!"
Y5 says: "Hup!"
Darling says: "Geez, careful much?"
Darling says: "You almost smashed our loot."
Sweetie says: "Yeah, watch it next time."
Darling says: "Can't this rabbit swim any faster?"
Sweetie says: "On it."
BMO says: "I told you we would make it."
BMO says: "You sure are a worried wart, Olive."
Sweetie says: "Hey, Flatfoot, we found this thing inside the Hugomat."
Sweetie says: "We don't know what it does."
Sweetie says: "So, it's yours."
BMO says: "Ooh, that's smooth data."
BMO unplugs the drive and crushes it under his foot.
Y5 says: "I can't believe I did that."
BMO says: "How did it feel?"
Y5 says: "Kinda..."
Y5 says: "good, actually."
BMO says: "Of course!"
BMO says: "You're my deputy, after all!"
Y5 says: "Oh!"
Y5 says: "R-Right."
Y5 says: "Listen, BMO."
BMO says: "Yes, my true friend?"
Y5 says: "Uh, BMO, there's something I need to tell you."
Mr. M's vehicle stops next to them.
Mr. M says: "Get in the car."
BMO says: "We should accept this ride from a stranger."
There's an awkward silence as BMO, Y5, and Olive are face to face in front of Mr. M in the car.
BMO says: "This is a pretty sick ride, I gotta say."
Mr. M's car drives fast and while and it almost hits a citizen on the way.
BMO says: "Is that..."
BMO says: "?"
Mr. M says: "That's the answer to all the Drift's problems!"
Mr. M says: "Behold!"
Mr. M says: "The Unity Pod!"
BMO says: "Oh, I thought it was a popcorn maker."
Mr. M says: "Hugo's whippin' up some pretty sweet gadgets in there, the raddest stuff your little bot eyes will ever see."
BMO says: "Oh, boy."
Y5 says: "So what if Hugo takes BMO apart?"
Y5 says: "It..."
Y5 says: "It's for the greater good, right?"
Y5 says: "And I am all about the greater good."
Y5 says: "Greater good!"
They enter Hugo's headquarters.
Y5 says: "So many Hugomats."
Mr. M says: "Yep, yep."
Mr. M says: "I actually came up with those myself."
Mr. M says: "Isn't that right, boss?"
Hugo says: "Huh?"
Hugo says: "Uh, yes."
Hugo says: "Ha, uh, the Hugomats were Mr."
Hugo says: "M's idea."
Y5 says: "Hugo."
Hugo says: "That boy loves flashy gadgets."
Hugo says: "Me?"
Hugo says: "I'm more of a pragmatist."
Hugo says: "You must be KS-2's daughter."
Hugo says: "Nice to meet you."
Y5 says: "Uh, you, too, also."
Hugo says: "Is this the spicy tech I heard about?"
BMO says: "You are so gray, and bald."
Hugo says: "Ha!"
Hugo says: "Yeah, I am."
Hugo says: "Oh!"
Hugo says: "Uh..."
Hugo says: "Noice!"
Y5 says: "Buh..."
Hugo says: "Mr."
Hugo says: "M, why don't you entertain our guests for a bit?"
Mr. M says: "You're a kid."
Mr. M says: "Kids love dumb games, right?"
Y5 says: "Um..."
Mr. M says: "Great!"
Y5 looks at BMO, who is humming, waiting for Hugo.
Y5 says: "The greater good."
Mr. M says: "What do you say we spice things up a bit?"
Mr. M says: "If I win, I get those fancy grav boots."
Y5 says: "What?"
Y5 says: "No way."
Mr. M says: "Oh, come on."
Mr. M says: "If I lose, you get my fancy boots."
Y5 says: "Ugh."
Hugo says: "Dang, this robot is one-of-a-kind."
Hugo says: "But nothing here I can use."
Y5 sighs in relief.
Hugo says: "Bummer."
Hugo says: "Well, maybe next time, KS-2's daughter."
BMO says: "Not so fast!"
BMO says: "The sheriff is here to help."
BMO says: "Tell me what you need."
Hugo says: "Okay..."
Hugo says: "We've located the final component for the Unity Pod..."
Hugo says: "the Genesis Crystal."
Hugo says: "Unfortunately, it lies within the impenetrable Jungle Pod."
Hugo says: "And all our attempts to grab it have been hot garbo."
Hugo says: "So, we're engineering our own."
Hugo says: "How's it going, guys?"
One of the Engineers says: "I think we've finally cracked it, sir."
One of the Engineers says: "Permission to run a test?"
One of the Engineers says: "Cool, cool."
One of the Engineers says: "Commencing test 325."
A synthetic crystal is being tested but it soon explodes.
Y5 says: "Huh?"
Y5 says: "That..."
Y5 says: "That shouldn't count!"
Mr. M says: "Tough beans, kid."
Mr. M says: "A deal's a deal."
Y5 says: "No!"
One of the Engineers says: "Sorry, Hugo."
One of the Engineers says: "Please don't be mad."
BMO says: "You are not a very good scientist!"
Hugo says: "Oh."
Hugo says: "Reset for test 326."
BMO says: "No, I will get you the real junk."
Hugo says: "What?"
Hugo says: "Oh..."
Hugo says: "Really?"
BMO says: "I'm your Huckleberry."
Mr. M says: "Now, I gotta agree with the little bot, boss."
Mr. M says: "He's quick, plants won't eat him..."
BMO says: "That's right."
BMO says: "Plants hate me!"
Hugo says: "I'm smelling what you're baking."
Hugo says: "Smells good."
Hugo says: "You know what?"
Hugo says: "Let's try it."
Hugo says: "What the heck?"
Y5 says: "Um, is that..."
BMO says: "Saddle up, deputy!"
BMO says: "We are going to find some treasure!"
Y5 says: "Are you really sure about this?"
BMO says: "I believe in us."
Mr. M says: "I'll meet you out front."
As Y5 leaves with BMO, she meets her mother as the door opens.
Y5 says: "Aah!"
KS-2 says: "Aah!"
Y5 says: "Mom, uh, what, uh..."
KS-2 says: "There was some kind of accident at the crystal lab."
KS-2 says: "Apparently the new prototype exploded..."
KS-2 says: "again."
BMO says: "Oh, Mom."
BMO says: "Don't worry about that fake."
BMO says: "The BMO is headed to the Jungle Pod right now to fetch the real one."
KS-2 says: "Why isn't BMO in a million pieces?!"
KS-2 says: "!"
Y5 says: "Uh, Hugo didn't need him?"
KS-2 says: "Fantastic!"
KS-2 says: "So we're back at square one."
BMO says: "Lady, stop talking."
BMO says: "Come on, sidekick deputy!"
KS-2 says: "What?!"
KS-2 says: "!"
KS-2 says: "You're following that little toy's orders?!"
KS-2 says: "!"
Y5 says: "No!"
Y5 says: "I'm just following Hugo's orders!"
KS-2 says: "Y4!"
KS-2 says: "Tell me the truth!"
Y5 says: "..."
Y5 says: "I'm sorry, Mom."
Y5 says: "I-I was just humoring it at first."
Y5 says: "So we could get to Hugo, no fuss."
Y5 says: "But I got carried away."
Y5 says: "I know I'm not some "deputy," alright?"
Y5 says: "It was just a dumb game."
Mr. M says: "You two comin' or what?"
BMO says: "Yeah."
BMO says: "I am."
BMO says: "Because I'm the only one around here that doesn't bite."
Olive flies in front of BMO, blocking him.
BMO says: "Aah!"
BMO says: "Stop it, Bad Olive!"
Y5 says: "Olive!"
Y5 says: "Let him go."
BMO says: "I don't need your help."
Y5 says: "BMO, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings!"
BMO says: "I have no feelings!"
Mr. M says: "Forget about her, champ."
Mr. M says: "Big, cool guys like us don't need nobody else."
BMO says: "You make my feelings happy!"
KS-2 says: "Y4!"
KS-2 says: "Come on!"
Y5 says: "Yes, ma'am."
Mr. M brings BMO to the Jungle Pod.
BMO says: "Yep, this doesn't feel dangerous at all."
BMO says: "Aren't you coming?"
Mr. M says: "Oh, uh, no."
Mr. M says: "It's real easy to get lost in J-Pod."
Mr. M says: "So I'll be guiding you with this map."
BMO says: "Oh."
BMO says: "But couldn't we bring the map?"
Mr. M says: "Think fast."
Mr. M says: "We'll stay in touch through that walkie-talkie."
Mr. M says: "You'll only be alone in the, uh, literal sense."
BMO says: "BMO is never alone."
BMO says: "Right, Football?"
Football says: "Please, don't bring me in there, BMO."
Mr. M says: "Keep walking straight for 1,400 frames."
BMO says: "Copy that."
BMO says: "1,002, 1,003, 1,004."
Football says: "I don't like this place, BMO."
BMO says: "You are a delicate soul, Football."
BMO says: "But BMO will not be intimidated by nature!"
BMO says: "Aah!"
BMO says: "Ah, so pretty."
Football says: "BMO, I'm scared."
BMO says: "Oh, Football."
BMO says: "I know you're a scaredy cat, but I have to complete my mission."
Football says: "BMO, I think maybe you're also scared of this mission."
BMO says: "No."
Football says: "BMO, if you bonk this up and die, I couldn't live with myself."
BMO says: "Oh, Football, I won't bonk up."
A creature with white tentacles seizes BMO's foot.
BMO says: "Aah!"
BMO says: "Whack!"
BMO says: "Whack!"
BMO says: "Aaaaaah!"
BMO falls into a hole as the creature chases above.
BMO says: "Lucky this hole was here."
BMO says: "Oh."
Football says: "Not lucky, BMO."
Football says: "You are in the dirt hole now."
Football says: "Dirt hole!"
BMO says: "Aaaaah!"
BMO says: "Run, BMO!"
The hole starts to emit green substances, which briefly erodes one of BMO's hands.
BMO says: "Aah!"
The crab creatures in the hole gather together, and they tap their claws.
BMO says: "Ew!"
As the tap continues, a wing is formed in the claw and the creatures fly away. There is still one left that still can't activate its wings.
BMO says: "You are my gross ticket out of here!"
BMO says: "Crusty piece of crab!"
BMO says: "Fly, donkus!"
BMO says: "Yay!"
BMO says: "You are my new best friend, Crusty!"
As they fly, Crusty is eaten and BMO falls from the air.
BMO says: "Crusty!"
Mr. M says: "BMO?"
Mr. M says: "BMO!"
BMO says: "That was a close call, Mr."
BMO says: "M."
BMO says: "Mother Drift got a taste of BMO, but I licked her right back."
Mr. M says: "Whose mother?"
Y5 is with her mother, who is fixing the prototype with others.
KS-2 says: "Y4!"
KS-2 says: "Could you bring me a J-clamp from out by the..."
KS-2 says: "Where are your gravity boots?"
Y5 says: "I was playing cards with..."
KS-2 says: "You gambled?!"
KS-2 says: "!"
Y5 says: "What?!"
Y5 says: "!"
Y5 says: "No!"
Y5 says: "The..."
Y5 says: "It was Mr..."
KS-2 says: "Honestly, Y4!"
KS-2 says: "We'll talk about this later."
Y5 goes to find her boots and she found them in the storage room of Mr. M's.
Y5 says: "Ha!"
Y5 says: "Wait."
Y5 says: "That's another Hugomat stick."
Y5 says: "I wonder what's on these."
Y5 says: "Whoa!"
Y5 says: "What the h..."
The scene cuts to Mr. M and BMO.
Mr. M says: "Hey, good job, li'l guy!"
Mr. M says: "You'll be on top of the crystal in a mm-bop!"
BMO says: "It's..."
BMO says: "mad indignant."
Y5 says: "All of the Hugomats are networked."
Y5 says: "Mr."
Y5 says: "M has them identifying useful components in each pod without anyone knowing."
Y5 says: "That's so unethical."
Y5 says: "I hope BMO is okay."
Football says: "I don't feel good about this, BMO."
BMO says: "I'm going to take this crystal, Football."
BMO says: "I'm going to be a hero."
BMO says: "I don't need a deputy!"
BMO says: "I don't need anybody!"
As soon as the crystal is unplugged by BMO, all the creatures in the jungle start to shriek, struggle, and they wither away very fast. BMO flees.
BMO says: "Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!"
Y5 says: "Look, Olive."
Y5 says: "The Genesis Crystal is moving."
Y5 says: "BMO did it!"
A message of the projection reveals that the Jungle Pod fails.
Y5 says: "Wait."
Y5 says: "Wait, wait, wait!"
Y5 says: "All of the failed pods are missing components."
Y5 says: "By taking them, Mr."
Y5 says: "M is killing the Drift."
Y5 says: "We have to warn Hugo!"
BMO screams as he runs for his life.
BMO says: "Blood!"
BMO says: "Blood-erflies!"
BMO says: "Mr."
BMO says: "M!"
BMO says: "I got the crystal!"
Mr. M says: "Throw it here so you can run faster!"
Mr. M says: "Yes!"
BMO says: "Now catch me!"
Mr. M shuts down the gate, with only BMO's right arm stuck outside, flapping.
Mr. M says: "Oh."
Mr. M says: "Very unfortunate."
Football says: "Oh, BMO, you tried, but you were never the hero of the story I like to call life."
Football says: "You were always just the cute sidekick."
BMO says: "Football!"
Football says: "Oh, no, don't cry, BMO."
BMO says: "You know I'm an empath."
A creature reaches BMO and tries to pull him away.
BMO says: "Huh?!"
BMO says: "!"
BMO says: "No!"
BMO says: "No!"
BMO says: "Football!"
BMO says: "Help!"
Football says: "BMO!"
BMO is ripped into pieces. Cuts to his subconsciousness.
BMO says: "Oh."
BMO says: "This is probably bad, huh?"
BMO says: "I think I'm dying."
BMO says: "But that's okay."
BMO says: "BMO always bounces back."
Purple BMO says: "Mnh-mnh."
Purple BMO says: "Not this time."
BMO says: "But I'm supposed to save the Drift."
BMO says: "That's my job."
Red BMO says: "Now your job is to be dead."
BMO says: "Oh, no."
Blue BMO says: "BMO, you can get through this."
BMO says: "Really?"
Green BMO says: "Just kidding."
Yellow BMO says: "You're not a hero."
All colorful BMOs says: "You're nothing but a little kid, BMO."
BMO says: "Oh."
BMO says: "No."
BMO says: "BMO always bounces ba..."
The scene cuts to BMO's parts scattered on the ground.
Y5 says: "Hugo!"
Y5 says: "Hugo, Hugo, Hugo!"
Y5 says: "I never had to do this much exercise before I ran into BMO..."
Y5 says: "Aah!"
KS-2 says: "I've been waiting for those J-clamps."
Y5 says: "Mom, look what I grabbed from Mr."
Y5 says: "M's office!"
Y5 says: "He's behind all of it..."
Y5 says: "The Drift collapse, the pod failures."
Y5 says: "He's a no-good, rootin'-tootin' four flusher!"
KS-2 says: "I don't know if those are swear words, but that sassy robot has messed you up."
Mr. M says: "What's up, bunnies?"
Mr. M says: "Hopefully nothing..."
Mr. M says: "slanderous."
KS-2 says: "I am so sorry, sir."
Mr. M says: "No harm done."
Y5 says: "Ha!"
Y5 says: "I've already got all the proof backed up right here!"
Mr. M says: "Woof."
KS-2 deactivates Olive.
Y5 says: "Mom!"
Y5 says: "Where's BMO?"
Mr. M says: "Uhp, uhp, uhp."
Mr. M says: "The good news is that he got the Genesis Crystal."
Mr. M says: "The even better news is that li'l BMO died a hero."
KS-2 says: "Hurrah!"
her husband says: "Hurrah!"
Y5 says: "No!"
Y5 says: "I have to save him!"
KS-2 says: "No, Y4!"
Y5 says: "My name is Y5."
Y5 says: "BMO is my friend."
Y5 says: "And I let him down because I didn't want to disappoint you."
KS-2 says: "Y4!"
Mr. M says: "Ha."
Mr. M says: "Kids, right?"
Mr. M says: "Always calling out their deadbeat parents."
KS-2 says: "What?"
Mr. M says: "What?"
Y5 says: "I can't do this alone."
Y5 says: "Olive's gone."
Y5 says: "It's too far to the Jungle Pod."
Y5 says: "I'm too slow."
Y5 says: "Huh  Stop."
Y5 says: "Stop."
Y5 says: "He's not here."
Y5 says: "Listen, BMO's in trouble."
Ricky flies fast with Y5 to the gate of Jungle Pod.
Y5 says: "BMO!"
Y5 says: "I'll get you..."
Y5 says: "o-o-o-o-ut!"
Y5 says: "Aah!"
Y5 says: "Stop!"
Darling says: "Stop!"
Darling says: "Hey, back off!"
Darling says: "We had to squeeze all these parts out of a sealed pod."
Y5 says: "That's my friend!"
Darling says: "I'll sell you the parts."
Sweetie says: "Ain't this the bunny that what, like, saved us?"
Y5 says: "Please!"
Y5 says: "The Drift is in danger, and BMO's the only one people will listen to!"
Darling says: "Ohh, my conscience gland."
Sweetie says: "We may know somebody who can help."
Ricky brings them to the wasteland.
Darling says: "Ha!"
Sweetie says: "Yo, CGO."
Sweetie says: "You up?"
Y5 says: "CGO?"
CGO says: "I smell that goody scrap."
CGO says: "I call dibs."
Darling says: "Make us an offer."
Y5 says: "What?"
Y5 says: "Cut it out!"
Y5 says: "I-I mean, ma'am, these two said you could patch up the sheriff."
CGO says: "Hmm."
CGO says: "This is a MO Co."
CGO says: "Bot."
Y5 says: "You know this model?"
CGO says: "I'm practically a cousin, a janky off-brand cousin."
Sweetie says: "Yeah, but can you do it, though?"
CGO says: "Hmm..."
CGO says: "probs."
Y5 says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Y5 says: "With BMO's cred, we can convince Hugo to stop Mr."
Y5 says: "M's schemes."
CGO says: "Hugo?"
CGO says: "I don't know what you've heard, but Hugo is the worst."
Y5 says: "What do you know?"
CGO says: "Uh, duh."
CGO says: "He created me."
CGO says: "We go way back, to the real busted last days of Earth."
CGO says: "Hugo's a great guy..."
CGO says: "as long as he thinks you're good for something."
On hearing this, Y5 squats back and sheds tears silently.
CGO says: "Hey, quit leaking on my scrap."
CGO says: "Fingers crossed."
CGO says: "Maybe he needs to warm up a bit."
KS-2 puts the Genesis Crystal on the brackets extended from the Unity Pod; with the engineers' help, the Unity Pod initializes priming sequence. At the same time, The Drift starts to fail.
Darling says: "Whoop."
Darling says: "Was that me?"
Y5 says: "Ow!"
Y5 says: "BMO, you have to wake up!"
Y5 says: "I can't fix this!"
Y5 says: "I'm just a little kid!"
BMO says: "I said the same thing when I was dying."
BMO says: "You saved me."
BMO says: "You can save the Drift."
Y5 says: "But it's just too much."
BMO says: "Even when things look really, really stupid, we still have to try."
Cole says: "Our suns all went out."
One of the farmers says: "That's nothing."
One of the farmers says: "All our crops are dying."
One of the farmers says: "It's gross."
Y5's Dad says: "Oof!"
Y5's Dad says: "Pod fails."
Y5's Dad says: "They're spreading everywhere."
KS-2 says: "Y4 was right!"
Y5's Dad says: "I've never heard you say those words."
KS-2 says: "Hugo!"
KS-2 says: "You have to shut down the priming sequence!"
KS-2 says: "We're on the verge of station-wide collapse!"
Hugo says: "Uh, this is exactly the kind of problem the Unity Pod team will be working to prevent."
Hugo says: "Hugocorp Gold Members, come on up here."
Y5 and her friends, screaming, arrives to the plaza with the help by Ricky.
Y5 says: "Ohh!"
Y5 says: "Everyone, wait!"
Y5 says: "Hugo's up to no good!"
Y5 says: "There's proof in this Hugomat!"
BMO says: "Oh!"
BMO says: "Are you trying to get another drive?"
Y5 says: "Do you still have the data?"
BMO says: "That smooth, smooth data."
BMO says: "Right here."
Y5 says: "You're donking it all up, Hugo!"
Y5 says: "Do you deny it?"
Hugo says: "Nah, it's all true."
Hugo says: "The Unity Pod was always designed to save only myself and my loyal inner circle."
Hugo says: "The rest of the Drift is..."
Hugo says: "Well, it's unfortunate collateral damage in the grand scheme of things."
Hugo says: "Besides, this all can't be on me."
Hugo says: "Y'all thought the Unity Pod sounded like a sweet deal, as long as you thought you were getting a piece of the pie."
Hugo says: "But if anyone was offended by my actions, I am truly, truly..."
Mr. M says: "Well, time for me to get the heck out of here."
Mr. M says: "Wuh-oh!"
Y5's Dad says: "There's no way to stop the activation process."
KS-2 says: "The station's power will be sucked dry!"
Y5 says: "No!"
Y5 says: "We were so close!"
BMO says: "Why don't we just pull the plug?"
BMO says: "If we remove the plug before it's powered up, it won't turn on."
KS-2 says: "The robot is right."
KS-2 says: "The only way we can stop the U-Pod from draining all the juice from the Drift is to eject it."
BMO says: "Yes!"
BMO says: "Brute force!"
KS-2 says: "Everyone, we're going to need a lot of muscle."
One of the farmers says: "I got muscle."
One of the farmers says: "Lard muscle."
One of the farmers says: "Go on!"
One of the farmers says: "Put yer bumps into it!"
Cole says: "Swing those shields, Shells!"
BMO says: "Use your handsome bodies!"
BMO says: "Go, go, go!"
BMO says: "Ice that pod!"
All Drift citizens says: "Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!"
The space lards, with their forces, destroys the scaffolding of the Unity Pods and eject the pod outside the Drift; Mr. M fails to catch up with the pod.
Mr. M says: "Well, here comes the rascal."
Y5 says: "Ahhhhh!"
Y5 says: "We did it!"
Y5 says: "Oh!"
BMO says: "No, we did it!"
Everyone cheers.
KS-2 says: "Hold up, everyone!"
KS-2 says: "I don't want to be a downer, but we just launched all of our best resources into space."
One of the citizens says: "Is it too late to get on the U-Pod?"
Y5 says: "It's true."
Y5 says: "Most of the station is dead now, and all communications are down."
Y5 says: "We're going to have to manage the remaining resources to survive."
Y5 says: "We need to learn how to help each other."
Y5 says: "I know it's hard, but we have to try, or we won't make it."
Sweetie says: "I'll give it a shot."
Darling says: "Yeah."
Darling says: "We can teach y'all how to steal and, uh..."
Sweetie says: "Forage for spare parts in the defunct pods."
One of the citizens says: "We'll rebuild Hugo's old lab."
One of the citizens says: "Maybe we can find some non-apocalyptic energy."
Y5's Dad says: "Y5?"
Y5's Dad says: "Can you forgive us?"
Y5's Dad says: "We were so focused on getting our family to a better place that we lost our way."
KS-2 says: "You're an amazing person, Y5."
BMO says: "Yep, it's time for this sheriff to move on."
BMO says: "Ricky, let's ride!"
BMO says: "Yee-haw!"
Ricky flies away with BMO, leaving the Drift. Meanwhile, Hugo is in the inactive Unity Pod, sitting alone in the controlling room.
Hugo says: "Huh?"
Olive reactivates and goes out from a bag.
Hugo says: "Oh, it's you."
Hugo says: "Still disappointed in me?"
Hugo says: "Ha!"
BMO says: "..."
BMO says: "And I grabbed as many snacks as I wanted."
BMO says: "The end."
BMO says: "I should tell that story to Y5 next time I see her."
BMO says: "I bet she will be mayor by then."
Ricky stops by the outer space near the Earth.
BMO says: "Huh?"
BMO says: "We are here!"
BMO says: "I will strap in."
Ricky starts to land like a meteorite and lands on the Grass Lands.
BMO says: "Ricky, you beast!"
BMO says: "Now go!"
BMO says: "Be free!"
Ricky says: "My name is Twinkletoes."
BMO says: "Oh, okay."
BMO spots young Finn and Jake, who is playing a wood sword fight in front of the Tree Fort.
BMO says: "Who's that?"
BMO walks toward Finn and Jake.
