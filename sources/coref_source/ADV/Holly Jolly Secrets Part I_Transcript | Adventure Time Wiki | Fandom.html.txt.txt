The episode begins with Finn looking at a map and then at Jake, who is smiling.
Finn says: "Jake..."
Finn says: "you made this?"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "And you buried the treasure right here?"
Jake says: "Uh-huh."
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "You're awesome!"
Finn says: "So cool..."
After a scene transition, Finn and Jake are still digging. They eventually come across a case in the dirt.
Finn says: "A suitcase?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Oh, man!"
Jake says: "I found it at the dump and then buried it without lookin' inside."
They open it.
Finn says: "Whoa."
Finn says: "Wait a second, man."
Finn says: "I know this case."
Flashback. Finn is dancing in the Cotton Candy Forest.
Finn says: "One night, while you were away at Lady's house, I was dancing in the woods..."
Ice King says: "Evil tapes!"
Ice King says: "Evil!"
Finn says: "Perchance I saw the Ice King doing something suspicious, so I trailed 'im to the dump, where he buried this case in the ground."
Ice King says: "You're evil, tapes!"
Ice King says: "Full of evil secrets!"
Ice King says: "That's why I'm going to bury you where no one will ever find you..."
Ice King says: "under all these boogers!"
Ice King says: "Wee, hahahahaha!"
Ice King says: "Wee, hahahaha!"
Finn says: "I waited for him to leave..."
Finn says: "but he played in those boogers for hours."
Finn says: "I decided to come back later for the case..."
Finn says: "but I lost track of it."
Flashback ends.
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "And I found it?"
Finn says: "Mm-hmm."
Jake says: "Heh-heh-heh."
Jake says: "Let's have a secret screening!"
Jake says: "I'll make some fliers for it!"
Later, Jake is hammering a flier that says, "ATTENTION—SECRET TAPE WATCHING PARTY—TODAY AT NOON—AT FINN & JAKE'S AWESOME HOUSE *ONLY FINN AND JAKE AND BEEMO ARE INVITED. ~THANK YOU," to a tree. He's hammered in hundreds of these fliers.
Jake says: "There."
Jake says: "Now nobody will bother us."
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Jake, come on!"
Jake runs to the Tree Fort. The words, "An Adventure Time Christmas" appear on the screen.
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "You can play this , right, BMO?"
BMO says: "Yes, Finn."
BMO says: "It goes in my butt!"
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn inserts the tape.
Jake says: "This is so exciting!"
Video starts. It's Ice King in his bedroom.
Ice King says: "Hello, dear diary."
Ice King says: "Pretty good day so far."
Ice King says: "Got up bright and early and had a healthy and slimming breakfast, did fourteen minutes of cardio..."
Jake says: "Dude..."
Jake says: "what are we watchin'?"
Finn says: "I think it's the Ice King's diary."
Ice King says: "..."
Ice King says: "I mean, I'm not gonna win carpenter of the year or anything, but it's a place to hang up the old toothbrush."
Penguin gets on Ice King's bed.
Penguin says: "Wenk."
Ice King says: "Gunther?"
Ice King says: "Hey, Gunther."
Ice King says: "Get-get away from the camera, sweetie."
Ice King says: "Papa's recording his innermost thoughts."
Ice King says: "'Member?"
Ice King says: "I explained this to you?"
Ice King says: "GUNTHER!!!"
Penguin says: "Wenk."
Ice King says: "Well, anyway, as you can see, I'm not wearing my—"
Penguin says: "Wenk."
Ice King says: "I'm not wearing my—"
Penguin says: "Wenk wenk."
Ice King says: "Sweetie, I raised my voice because you were giving me the silent treatment."
Ice King says: "You understand?"
Penguin says: "Wenk."
Ice King says: "I love you."
Jake says: "Can we fast-forward?"
Finn says: "No, man, we might miss something."
Ice King says: "There must be more to life than this..."
Penguin says: "Wenk."
Ice King says: "I know."
Ice King says: "You don't like when I'm contemplative."
Ice King says: "..."
Ice King says: "C-contemplative..."
Ice King says: "No, con-temp-la—"
Ice King says: "Let's put on a play!"
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "?"
Ice King says: "Oh, Ice King!"
Ice King says: "You're so cool!"
Ice King says: "You take such good care of yourself!"
Ice King says: "I wanna be with you!"
Penguin says: "Wenk."
Penguin says: "Wenk wenk."
Ice King says: "No, Gunther, beard stays on."
Penguin says: "Wenk."
Ice King says: "Gunther, I need ya to wear the beard!"
Penguin says: "Wenk!"
Ice King says: "Gunther!"
Jake says: "Hey, pause it, BMO."
Finn says: "There's gotta be some evil secrets in here."
Finn says: "I wanna keep watching."
Jake says: "Okay..."
Jake says: "Well, why don't I make us some snacks?"
Jake says: "So I don't have to watch..."
Jake says: "this..."
BMO says: "Can we sit on the floor?"
BMO says: "I feel so far away from you guys!"
The scene is in a snowy forest in the Ice Kingdom. A penguin has an apple on his head.
Penguin says: "Wenk."
Penguin says: "Wenk!"
Back at the Tree Fort.
Finn and Jake are watching another tape. On it, Ice King is throwing a party. A penguin walks off.
Ice King says: "Gunther, no!"
Ice King says: "Gunther..."
Jake eats a snack. Finn tries to reach for a snack, but can't. Jake helps him.
Finn says: "Thanks, Gunther."
On the tape, the second penguin exits the party.
Ice King says: "Oh, fine!"
Ice King says: "Who needs you?"
Ice King says: "More dance party for us, right, Gunther?"
Finn says: "There's probably some evil secrets coming up."
Finn says: "Someone wants to see the secret tapes!"
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "Oh, but I was so clear in my flier!"
BMO says: "Let's peek through the window and check who it is!"
BMO says: "Maybe it's just pizza."
Finn says: "Right!"
Finn and BMO run towards the window.
Jake says: "Wait!"
Jake says: "Wait!"
Finn says: "What?"
BMO says: "What?"
Jake says: "You guys are checking too loud!"
Finn says: "More quietly!"
BMO turns down its volume.
BMO says: "I am quieter now."
Jake says: "Cool."
The three tip-toe towards the window and peek through it. Ice King is knocking on the door.
Ice King says: "Hey, guys, it's me."
Ice King says: "Can I come in and watch the secret tapes with you?"
Ice King says: "I brought some gifts!"
The trio dive from the window.
Finn says: "Aah!"
Jake says: "Aah!"
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "If we're quiet long enough, Ice King will think no one's home and go away."
More banging on the front door.
Ice King says: "Eh..."
Ice King says: "No one's home."
Ice King says: "Guess I'll go away."
Suddenly, BMO's alarm for Finn's bath goes off. Finn and Jake panic.
Ice King says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Just turn your alarm off!"
Ice King says: "Hmm."
Ice King says: "That sounds like BMO!"
BMO says: "My alarm says it's time for Finn's bath."
BMO says: "Finn, get naked."
Finn says: "No, just hit your snooze button!"
BMO says: "I cannot self-snooze."
BMO says: "It's against my programming."
Finn says: "Well, then, tell me how to do it!"
BMO says: "Press and hold."
BMO says: "I'm sorry."
BMO says: "..."
BMO says: "We can still take a bath..."
More banging.
Finn says: "He must know we're watching his tapes."
Finn says: "We need to find his secrets faster."
Scene transition. Finn and Jake view another tape, on which Ice King is crying.
Ice King says: "Oh, diary!"

Ice King says: "So there we are."
Ice King says: "Turtle Princess is frozen and in my little ice wheelbarrow, and there was..."
Ice King says: "magic in the air."
Ice King says: "We were both feeling it."
Ice King says: "You know, dear diary, I'm starting to worry that all these entries sound exactly the same, and that my life is just me running in place on some..."
Ice King says: "giant hamster wheel."
Jake says: "Fast-forward, BMO."

Jake says: "I'm gonna take a nap..."
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "These tapes are important!"
Finn says: "We just don't know why yet."
Finn says: "BMO, fast-forward to triple speed!"
BMO says: "Okay."
BMO does so. On the tape, Ice King is working out.
Finn says: "BMO, play normal speed."
Ice King says: "I can't do it..."
Jake says: "Maybe he's talkin' in secret code."
Finn says: "Telling evil secrets in secret code..."
Finn says: "He's brilliant!"
Jake says: "Well, how do we decode the secrets?"
BMO says: "Why don't we call others for help?"
Finn says: "BMO, you're brilliant!"
Jake says: "Well, who do we call?"
Finn says: "Um..."
Finn says: "The smartest person we know, Princess Bubblegum!"
Finn says: "She's brilliant..."
Scene transition. Finn is calling her. Meanwhile, Ice King climbs to the upper story window, laughing deviously.
Finn says: "Hey, Princess Bubblegum."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hey, Finn."
Finn says: "Jake and I found a bunch of secret tapes!"
Finn says: "We were wondering if you'd help us decode them."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Codes?"
Jake says: "Yeah, they're really stupid, but, y'know..."
Jake says: "Maybe they're encoded or whateva."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, you called the right person."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I know a lot about codes."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Let's start with—"
The line gets cut.
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "Ohh..."
They re-dial.
Finn says: "Hey, Princess."
Finn says: "We got disconnected."
Finn says: "Hey/Uhhh, you sound weird!"
Jake says: "Hey/Uhhh, you sound weird!"
Ice King says: "Must be a bad connection."
Ice King says: "That's why we were disconnected earlier on the telephone."
BMO says: "Ice King is on the phone outside!"
They run towards the window.
Finn says: "So..."
Finn says: "how's the weather in Candy Kingdom?"
Ice King says: "Oh, the usual."
Ice King says: "There's ice everywhere and it smells like penguins!"
Finn says: "The only thing that smells like penguins is you, Ice King!!"
Ice King says: "How did you—"
Finn says: "What're you doing?!"
Finn says: "!"
Ice King says: "I wanna watch secret tapes with you guys."
Ice King says: "It'll be nice."
Finn says: "No, man!"
Ice King says: "But—"
Finn hangs up.
Finn says: "He doesn't know that we're watching his tapes."
Finn says: "We gotta find these evil secrets before he uses them against us!"
Ice King says: "Oh..."
Ice King says: "Fine."
Ice King says: "No more nice."
Ice King says: "NOW YOU GET ICE!!"
Ice King says: "Try watching those tapes with FROZEN EYEBALLS!"
Ice King laughs evilly as he sprays snow on the Tree Fort. Jake screams. The camera pans into his mouth as the first part concludes.
