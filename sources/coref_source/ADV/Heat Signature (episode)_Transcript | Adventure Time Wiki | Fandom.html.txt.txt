The episode opens with Finn and Jake standing on an abandoned highway. Jake stretches himself and Finn down, and they enter a cave.
Finn says: "Man, I still can't believe Marceline is 1,000 years old and has never seen Heat Signature."
Finn says: "This movie is gonna blow their minds."
Marceline opens the door.
Finn says: "Marceline!"
Finn says: "We brought Heat Signature."
Marceline says: "Woot!"
Marceline says: "Woot!"
Jake says: "Woo!"
Finn and Jake enter the house. A trio of ghosts float in the living room.
Marceline says: "Hey, so I want you all to meet Finn and Jake."
Marceline says: "They aren't..."
Marceline says: "completely lame."
Finn says: "Whatup?"
Marceline says: "Guys, this is Wendy..."
Wendy says: "Hey."
Marceline says: "Booboo..."
Booboo says: "Hello."
Booboo says: "Hello."
Marceline says: "..."
Marceline says: "and Georgy."
Georgy says: "Hey."
Marceline says: "We used to be in a gang together back in the underworld."
Finn says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "Yeah, that's pretty sweet."
Finn says: "Hope y'all like getting your minds blown, cause it's showtime."
Finn and Jake jump backwards onto the couch, and find out that it's hard as a rock.
Finn says: "What is wrong with this couch?"
Jake says: "Ehh, that made my teeth hurt."
Marceline says: "Oh yeah."
Marceline says: "Sorry, I don't ever really sit on there."
Marceline says: "I just float usually."
Marceline says: "We..."
Marceline says: "kinda all do."
Finn says: "Aww, what?"
Finn says: "man, no fair."
Marceline says: "Yeah, well, too bad you're not vampires."
Marceline says: "So, anyways, I..."
Finn says: "Wait!"
Finn says: "Hold on just a second."
Jake and Finn start whispering to each other.
Finn says: "Marceline, we insist you turn us into vampires."
Finn says: "Or ghosts, or whatever."
Finn says: "We just wanna fly."
Marceline says: "All right, all right."
Marceline says: "Fine."
Finn says: "Yes!"
Jake says: "Yes!"
Wendy says: "Come on, Marceline!"
Wendy says: "you're gonna turn these goofballs?"
Finn says: "Okay, Marceline, we're ready now."
Marceline says: "Okay, hold that thought."
Georgy says: "Huhuuuhhuh..."
Marceline floats back into the living room.
Marceline says: "I'm gonna perform the biting ritual."
Marceline says: "You guys close your eyes and don't open them until I say so."
Marceline says: "If you do..."
Marceline says: "your heads will EXPLODE!"
Marceline says: "Okay, Finn."
Marceline says: "You first."
Marceline lifts up Finn's hat, to reveal his neck. She then makes a hissing noise as she moves closer. Then she pinches Finn's neck. Finn lets out a screech.
Marceline says: "Bite."
Then Marceline does the same thing to Jake.
Marceline says: "Chomp."
Georgy, Wendy, and Booboo all giggle. Marceline puts a dab of ketchup on two of her fingertips and touches Finn and Jake so it looks like they've actually been bitten.
Marceline says: "Boop boop."
Marceline says: "Boop."
Marceline says: "Boop."
Marceline says: "Okey dokey."
Marceline says: "All done."
Marceline says: "How do you guys feel?"
Finn says: "Pretty..."
Finn says: "much..."
Finn says: "the same."
Jake says: "My neck sort of hurts."
Booboo says: "Don't you feel a little hungry..."
Booboo says: "for blood?"
Finn says: "I felt it."
Finn says: "Jake, do you feel it?"
Jake says: "Yeah, I could go for some blood."
Marceline and her ghostly buddies are all snickering in the background.
Finn says: "Oh no."
Finn says: "Jake."
Finn says: "Now we're gonna have to drink blood for all eternity."
Jake says: "Yeah, what if we turn evil?"
Jake says: "I'll hafta start wearing cologne."
Marceline floats by, carrying two apples.
Marceline says: "Relax, guys."
Marceline says: "You can satisfy your bloodlust without killing."
Marceline says: "Look."
Jake bites the apple, but gets mush all over himself and Finn.
Finn says: "Ugh."
Finn says: "Come on."
Jake says: "Sorry, bro."
Finn says: "Whooooa..."
Finn says: "Marceline, can we float now?"
Marceline says: "Mmm..."
Marceline says: "Not yet."
Marceline says: "That's a really advanced power."
Marceline says: "First, you gotta go through vampire orientation."
Georgy says: "Huhuuuhhuh..."
Everyone else glares at Georgy. His cheeks flush.
Marceline says: "Think you chumps can handle it?"
Finn says: "Oh, baby, yeah, baby, baby, baby, yeah, baby, yeah, yeah."
Jake says: "Oh, baby, yeah, baby, baby, baby, yeah, baby, yeah, yeah."
The scene cuts to everyone standing outside in a forest at night.
Marceline says: "Okay, guys, the first phase of vampire orientation is learning..."
Marceline says: "Ah!"
Marceline says: "Hey!"
Marceline says: "You ready for the power of..."
Marceline says: "invisibility?"
Finn says: "With all my heart."
Marceline says: "Good."
Marceline says: "Now, spin!"
Marceline sends Finn spinning around until he falls to the ground, feeling dizzy. Jake laughs.
Marceline says: "Give it a whirl, Jake!"
Marceline says: "Now chant, "INVISIBLE!"
Marceline says: "INVISIBLE!"
Finn says: "INVISIBLE!"
Jake says: "INVISIBLE!"
Finn says: "INVISIBLE!"
Jake says: "INVISIBLE!"
Marceline says: "Yup."
Marceline says: "It worked?"
Jake says: "We're invisible!"
Finn says: "You're invisible!"
Jake says: "Hey."
Jake says: "Then how come we can see each other?"
Marceline says: "Because you guys become vampires at the same time."
Marceline says: "So you are forever linked."
Finn says: "AWW YEAH!"
Jake says: "AWW YEAH!"
Finn and Jake happen upon a place deep in the woods where Lumpy Space Princess is camping out.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, my glob, Melissa."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Ever since Clara stopped eating meat, her skin looks so good."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I mean, she still looks fat, but like, I can't say that junk to her face."
Jake says: "Wow!"
Jake says: "LSP's a hobo!"
Finn says: "Let's mess with her."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm doing so awesome on my own."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Like, right now, I found this can of beans."
Finn and Jake start making moaning sounds, while picking up some of LSP's camping supplies.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Finn?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Jake!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Put down my stuff!"
Finn says: "She knows it's us."
Jake says: "She must recognize our voices."
Finn says: "Let's disguise them."
Finn says: "We're invisible!"
Finn and Jake continue to mess around the campsite.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Melissa, I have to go."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "They got into my toilet paper."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Melissa, I have to go!"
Marceline, Georgy, Wendy, and Booboo are all watching close by. They start to snicker as they do. LSP starts chasing them.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Give it back, you guys!"
Jake says: "Weeeee!"
He lets loose a roll of toilet paper, and it wraps around Finn's eyes, blindfolding him.
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Whoo-hoo-hoo!"
Finn says: "Yeah, Jake!"
Because Finn is blindfolded, he can't see where he's going, and his foot unintentionally knocks into the can of baked beans.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Nooooooooo!"
Time seems to pass in slow motion as the baked beans spill all over the ground.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "MY BEANS!!!"
Booboo says: "Time to join in on the fun!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You guys ruined everything!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm gonna kill you!"
Finn says: "But we're undead."
Jake says: "Geez, we really scared her."
Finn and Jake gasp as Marceline appears behind them.
Marceline says: "Nice vampire scare, guys."
Finn says: "Thanks."
Georgy, Wendy, and Booboo appear.
Booboo says: "Yeah, pretty good, fellas."
Finn says: "You know we are."
Booboo says: "Good."
Finn says: "Ow!"
Finn says: "What's the point of this lesson?"
Georgy says: "Kick 'em harder!"
Finn says: "Ow!"
Finn says: "It hurts!"
Jake says: "Ohhh!"
Marceline decides she's had enough.
Marceline says: "Okay, everyone!"
Marceline says: "Stop the toughness lesson!"
Georgy says: "What?"
Marceline says: "Finn, Jake."
Marceline says: "You guys okay?"
Finn and Jake are all covered in bumps and bruises.
Finn says: "We're okay."
Finn says: "It's all worth it."
Georgy says: "See?"
Georgy says: "They're fine."
Wendy says: "When did you go all soft?"
Wendy says: "You used to like teaching people about kicks."
Georgy says: "Hey, guys, I think you're ready to learn how to float."
Georgy says: "All you have to do is jump off that ledge."
Finn says: "Cool."
Marceline says: "W-wait!"
Marceline says: "There's more beginner lessons you need to learn before floating."
Marceline says: "Like..."
Marceline says: "uh..."
Marceline says: "the spooky vampire walk."
Marceline says: "See?"
Marceline says: "Spoooooky..."
Marceline says: "wooo!"
Finn says: "Heh heh."
Finn says: "No way."
Jake says: "We wanna fly!"
The ghosts take them away. Marceline growls in anger and floats after them.
Marceline says: "You guys stop right now."
Georgy says: "Marceline, chill out."
Georgy says: "It's going to be okay."
Georgy says: "We've got a plan."
Finn says: "VAMPIRES FOREVER!!!"
Jake says: "VAMPIRES FOREVER!!!"
Finn says: "WOOO!"
Jake says: "WOOO!"
Marceline says: "What are you guys waiting for?"
Marceline says: "You said you had a plan."
Wendy says: "We do."
Wendy says: "It's to let them die!"
Marceline is furious. Her eyes blaze with rage. Then she dives off the edge after Finn and Jake, turns invisible, and catches them just before they land on some jagged glass at the bottom. Finn and Jake cheer on all the while. Marceline, still unseen, drops the two of them safely on the ground.
Finn says: "We did it!"
Jake says: "We did it!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Woohoo!"
Jake says: "Woohoo!"
Finn says: "Awesome!"
Jake says: "Awesome!"
Marceline turns visible again. The ghosts float up to her looking not too satisfied.
Wendy says: "Way to go, Marceline."
Marceline says: "Hey, you guys need to stop trying to kill my friends!"
Booboo says: "They gotta die someday."
Wendy says: "Hey!"
Wendy says: "Let's invite them to our place!"
Wendy says: "When they show up..."
Wendy says: "We'll suck their guts out through their brains!"
Booboo says: "We'll suck their guts out through their brains!"
Georgy says: "We'll suck their guts out through their brains!"
Marceline and the ghosts float over to Finn and Jake.
Finn says: "Did you see us?"
Wendy says: "Yeah, you guys were pretty amazing."
Booboo says: "Hey, we're gonna throw a party..."
Booboo says: "in honor of your new vampire skills."
Finn says: "Holy snaps, that's awesome!"
Marceline says: "They're lying to you guys."
Marceline says: "They just wanna suck the guts out of the top of your head."
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "What?"
ghosts says: "What?"
Booboo says: "She's just jealous of you."
Wendy hands Finn and Jake an envelope.
Wendy says: "We'll see you at midnight at our place."
Marceline says: "Guys, promise me you're going to that party."
Finn says: "We're not gonna go."
Marceline says: "You're not?"
Finn says: "Nah."
Finn says: "I'm kinda tired from doing vampire stuff all day."
Finn says: "We're just gonna chill."
Marceline says: "Oh."
Marceline says: "Okay."
Finn says: "Well, we're going back home."
Jake says: "Peace."
The scene transitions to Jake and Finn standing in the Spooky Forest. Lightning flashes across the night sky. A run-down manor stands on top of the hill.
Finn says: "Number 25, Blood Drive."
Finn says: "Hey guys, we're here!"
Finn says: "Wow!"
Finn says: "Look at you guys!"
Finn says: "That's awesome!"
Georgy, Wendy, and Booboo have changed. They have significantly increased in size, are wearing laced collars, and have menacing eyes and puckered lips. Georgy closes the door. Then the ghosts join hands, spin around our heroes, and start chanting ominously. Their eyes and mouths start glowing white.
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "Georgy, what's wrong?"
Finn says: "Jake, what's happening?"
Jake says: "I think they're testing our vampire abilities."
Finn says: "Oh, sweet."
Finn says: "VAMPIRE KICK!"
Georgy says: "Aw, come on."
Georgy says: "Will you knock it off already?"
Wendy says: "You know you're not even real vampires."
Finn says: "Pssh."
Finn says: "Then why am I flying, Wendy?"
Finn says: "Yo, man."
Finn says: "I think Marceline tricked us."
Jake says: "Yeah."
The ghosts' mouths start to close in on our heroes when Marceline suddenly appears out of nowhere.
Marceline says: "VAMPIRE KICK!!!"
Marceline says: "Finn."
Marceline says: "Jake."
Marceline says: "I'm so sorry I got you into this."
Marceline says: "I should've never pranked you so perfectly."
Finn says: "It's okay."
Finn says: "You're here now to beat up those ghosts and save us."
Marceline says: "Oh, no, vampires can't beat ghosts."
Marceline says: "It's sort of a Rock-Paper-Scissors thing."
Marceline says: "I just came to apologize."
Finn says: "Aw, man."
Georgy says: "Uh..."
Georgy says: "did you guys say..."
Georgy says: "Heat Signature?"
The scene cuts to a clip from the movie Heat Signature. A Commander and Private are inside a submarine, looking at a scanner.
Commander says: "Have you located the enemy's heat signature, Private?"
Private says: "Yes, sir."
Private says: "But I also noticed something..."
Private says: "strange."
Private says: "Something..."
Private says: "I can't explain."
Commander says: "Well, spit it out, man!"
Private says: "I..."
Private says: "I..."
Private says: "I can't seem to locate..."
Private says: "our heat signature."
The scene reverts back to Marceline's living room. Marceline and the ghosts are watching in awe while Finn and Jake struggle about on the uncomfortable furniture, looking none too pleased.
Finn says: "This stink-ups mega bam-bam to the J-stop."
Finn says: "Could we just go back to the brain-eating or whatever?"
Georgy says: "MMM-HMM."
Georgy says: "After the movie."
Marceline says: "Shhh!"
ghosts says: "Shhh!"
Georgy says: "Shut!"
Private says: "Look out, Commander!"
Commander says: "Aaaagh!"
Commander says: "My heat signature!"
Marceline's face and the ghost's faces suddenly snap to a satisfied smile. The episode ends.
