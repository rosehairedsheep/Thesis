Joshua says: "Margaret, you're in a family way now."
Joshua says: "You should take a backseat from investigations."
Margaret says: "Oh, come on, Joshua."
Margaret says: "Even with this ankle-biter, I'm as quick as ever."
Margaret says: "Sure, my waist is bigger, but that just means more bullets in my ammo belt."
Joshua says: "You're missing the point, sugar."

Joshua says: "We're responding to a wire about missing pies."
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, yes."
Tree Trunks says: "A-a-a monster's been stealing my pies off of the windowsill."
Joshua says: "A monster, eh?"
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, yes, you can see the monster  tracks leading off into the forest."
Joshua says: "Well, those tracks are as phony as a three dollar bill."
Tree Trunks says: "The monster tracks are very real."
Tree Trunks says: "Wyatt!"
Wyatt says: "Aw, aw geez."
Wyatt says: "You got me."
Joshua says: "What's the big idea, Wyatt?"
Joshua says: "Why'd you burgle your wife's pie?"
Wyatt says: "Because it's amazing!"

Tree Trunks says: "And Leftenant Candy Corn said it came in through the window and touched him on the chest."
Tree Trunks says: "Oh!"
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, now I got myself all scared."
Tree Trunks says: "W-won't you check around to make sure no one is out there?"
Joshua says: "Of course."
Joshua says: "Probably nothing more than a peeper."
Joshua says: "Ha!"
Joshua says: "These country yokels are all just superstitious."
Joshua says: "I bet you that old elephant sees a monster a day."
Margaret says: "Joshua, look!"
Margaret says: "Something way larger than Wyatt made them."
Margaret says: "These tracks look real."
Joshua says: "Hot cram!"
Joshua says: "A peeping monster!"
Joshua says: "Oh, this town would surely put up a collection to nab this guy."
Joshua says: "Oh, too bad you're preggo."
Joshua says: "We got to pass."
Margaret says: "Come on, Joshua!"
Joshua says: "What?"
Margaret says: "Ha ha!"
Joshua says: "Margaret!"
Joshua says: "Margaret!"
Joshua says: "Wait for Pappy!"

Joshua says: "Come in, Margaret."
Joshua says: "Do you read me?"
Joshua says: "Over."
Joshua says: "You have to say "over" or I think you're still talking."
Joshua says: "Over."
Margaret says: "And what's with all this baby paraphernalia?"
Margaret says: "Wait a tick."
Margaret says: "Are you a baby?"
Monster says: "Uh-huh."
Margaret says: "Oh, no!"
Margaret says: "I must've scared the dickens out of you!"
Joshua says: "Margaret, stay away."
Joshua says: "Something's about to happen!"
Joshua says: "Margaret!"
Joshua says: "Boy, Jake left a scar on my head the size of a nickel."
Joshua says: "I'll have to wear a hat now, Margaret."
Joshua says: "Of course we do, dear."
Joshua says: "He's our boy."
Margaret says: "That he is."
Joshua says: "Yes, we've got one boy that I gave birth to and one boy that you gave birth to."
Joshua says: "Let's never tell him how it happened."
Margaret says: "Agreed."
