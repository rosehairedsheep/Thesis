Princess Bubblegum says: "Alright, guys."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hammer all these safety signs around this dungeon hole."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I've gotta jet off on my swan to take care of some royal junk."
Finn says: "You got it, Princess."
Jake says: "Whatever you want, mama."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Bubblegum, away!!"
Finn nails a sign with a sledgehammer, and Jake uses his fists as hammers.
Jake says: "Ow."
Jake says: "Ow."
Jake says: "Ow."
Finn says: "There."
Finn says: "That's the last sign, Jake."
Finn says: "Now no one will go down this hole, ever."
Finn says: "Probably a lot of dangerous, awesome stuff down this hole."
Finn says: "I better go take a look."
Finn jumps down the hole, and Jake fishes him out using his arm as a fishing pole and line.
Jake says: "Don't, dude."
Jake says: "For you see, that's the secret entrance to the Dungeon of the Crystal Eye!"
Finn says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "Legend has it that the eye rests in the deepest chamber of this accursed dungeon."
Jake says: "Man, we shouldn't even be talkin' about it, 'cause it's lunch time."
A "LUNCH TIME" logo pops up.
Finn says: "The crystal eye."
Finn says: "I wanna meet this dungeon."
Jake says: "Maybe after lunch."
Finn says: "Eh, I'll skip lunch."
Finn says: "Just catch up with me when you are finished."
Jake says: "*Pfft* Yeah, right."
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "Without the aid of my magnificent powers..."
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "You'd get killed down there."
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "I can do things without you!"
Finn says: "You wanna bet I can't?"
Jake says: "Nope."
Jake says: "Come get your sandwich."
Jake says: "Ahh!"
Jake says: "Help me!"
Jake says: "Ahh!"
Jake says: "Come put her out of her misery, dude!"
Finn says: "We are betting!"
Finn says: "I bet that I'll get that crystal eye and be back within 11 minutes."
Jake says: "I better go after him."
Jake says: "No, Jake!"
Jake says: "Stay here, with me..."
Jake says: "Oh, my..."
Finn says: "Dungeons!"
Finn says: "Chambers!"
Finn says: "Woah."
Finn says: "Doorways!"
Finn says: "Aww!"
Finn says: "Oh?"
A demonic cat with a kitten for a tongue comes out, and sucks his tongue back in his mouth.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Somebody come pick up your freaky cat."
Demon Cat says: "Greetings, Frank the Human Boy."
Finn says: "How did you almost know my name?!"
Finn says: "!"
Demon Cat says: "I have approximate knowledge of many things."
Demon Cat says: "For instance, I know that I am possibly going to slay you and munch on your eyeballs."
Finn says: "Huh, yeah right."
Finn says: "That sounds like idiot talk!"
Demon Cat says: "You're trespassing on my dungeon, manling."
Demon Cat says: "And I am the thing..."
Demon Cat says: "..."
Demon Cat says: "you should be afraid of."
Finn says: "You can't hurt me!"
Finn says: "I'm a radical boy on a mission for the crystal eye!"
Demon Cat says: "I'm going to unzip your skin and wear you like a little coat."
Finn says: "Unzip this!"
Finn says: "Bleep!"
Finn says: "OOF!"
Finn punches him, the Demon Cat's eyes fill up with blood.
Demon Cat says: "Now, you DIE!!"
Demon Cat says: "Wait a minute."
Finn says: "Yeah, right!"
Finn says: "Good excuse!"
Finn says: "Slaps, that cat was kicking my buns!"
Finn says: "And it might have finished my buns if it weren't for Jake's stank."
Finn says: "Dang it, Jake!"
Finn says: "I'll get that crystal eye on my own!"
Finn says: "With my own odors."
Finn says: "Oh!"
Finn says: "Giant key door it is!"
Tries to open, but it's locked.
Finn says: "If Jake was here, he could stretch his hand into a key and open it."
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "What the jug is that?"
Crawls in.
Finn says: "Oh, sweet, the key!"
Finn sings the Key Song.
Reaches for key, which is inside a gelatinous green jelly cube.
Finn says: "Ew, jelly cube?!"
Finn says: "!"
Bucket Knight says: "Halt!"
Bucket Knight says: "Come no further adventurer, for you see none can defeat..."
Bucket Knight says: "the Bucket Knight!"
Finn says: "Okay, then I won't fight you."
Bucket Knight says: "No!"
Finn says: "Hey cutie, do you know how to get to the crystal eye from here?"
Finn says: "Thanks!"
Bucket Knight says: "Hey!"
Bucket Knight says: "You can't pass through that door with out battling me!"
Finn says: "Yes, I can."
Finn says: "Because I'm huge compared to you."
Bucket Knight says: "..."
Bucket Knight says: "exponential growth!"
Finn says: "Aw, buckets."
Bucket Knight says: "Now, activate thine own powers, and we shall engage in thrilling single combat!"
Finn says: "Heh, thing is..."
Finn says: "I don't really..."
Finn says: "have any powers."
Bucket Knight says: "I see..."
Gets chased by Bucket Knight.
Finn says: "AAAAH!!"
Finn says: "Dang it, Jake wouldn't be running!"
Finn says: "He'd grow all big, and sock you right in the nose hole!"
Finn says: "Oww..."
Finn says: "I rode the knuckle train?"
Finn says: "But..."
Finn says: "I..."
Finn says: "I'm in my element."
Runs away and finally gets to the door, but the Bucket Knight is right behind him. Before he could hit Finn, Finn jumps through the door.
Finn says: "AHHHHH!!!!"
Finn says: "Ow!"
Finn says: "OW!"
Finn says: "Ow!"
Finn says: "OW!"
Finn says: "Ow!"
Finn says: "Uhh!"
Finn says: "That..."
Finn says: "sucked."
Demon Cat says: "Hey, my dinner is back."
Demon Cat says: "And your dog isn't with you!"
Demon Cat says: "That's what you said, right?"
Demon Cat says: "Jack the Dog is not "accompanying" you?"
Finn says: "You mean Jake?"
Demon Cat says: "Jake, Jack, whatever."
Demon Cat says: "He's not here, which means I'm going to rip your heart out."
Finn says: "Crud, crud, crud, crud, crud!"
Demon Cat says: "You can't hide from me, Jim."
Demon Cat says: "I know almost everything, remember?"
Demon Cat says: "I know exactly where you might be, Jim."
Demon Cat says: "I'm about to pounce on you."
Finn sits behind a rock pillar, nervous and scared.
Demon Cat says: "One..."
Demon Cat says: "two..."
Demon Cat says: "three!"
Demon Cat says: "Aw, man!"
Demon Cat says: "Well, there's only a few more places to look."
Finn says: "Oh, Jake..."
Finn says: "I'm such a fool."
Finn says: "A silly, silly fool."
Finn says: "Who the heck--?!"
Finn says: "!"
Guardian Angel says: "Hey, it's okay."
Guardian Angel says: "Shh, I'm your guardian angel, Finn."
Guardian Angel says: "I'm here to save you."
Finn says: "Re..."
Finn says: "really?"
Guardian Angel says: "Mmm-hm."
Guardian Angel says: "Come here, let the angel pick you up."
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "This is radical."
Guardian Angel says: "Are you comfortable?"
Guardian Angel says: "Would you like some snacks?"
Finn says: "I'm fine, thank you."
Guardian Angel says: "Here, let me clean you up, and mend your clothes."
Finn says: "Ha ha ha ha ha!"
Guardian Angel says: "I'm taking you to the chamber of the Crystal Eye..."
Guardian Angel says: "."
Finn says: "Aww, yeah!"
Guardian Angel says: "..."
Guardian Angel says: "where I'm going to cook you and eat your flesh."
Finn says: "Wow..."
Finn says: "Wait!"
Finn says: "What??!"
Finn says: "!"
Guardian Angel says: "Trust in your  guardian angel!"
Finn says: "Put me down, lady!"
Guardian Angel says: "As you wish."
Drops Finn in a cage full of soup and ingredients.
Finn says: "Man, everybody wants to eat me up."
Finn says: "It's probably 'cause I'm so sweet."
Guardian Angel says: "Now for little kid soup."
Guardian Angel says: "The secret is a low flame over a long period."
Finn says: "That's Jake's secret, too."
Finn says: "I sure hope he saves me."
Guardian Angel says: "I will save thee, Finn."
Finn says: "Lady, you are sick!"
Finn says: "Oh, Jake."
Jake says: "What?"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Finn says: "What are you doing here?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "I was looking for you, knucklehead!"
Jake says: "I was so worried, that right after lunch, I plunged into the dungeon after you."
Jake says: "Strangest thing, though, I kept runnin' into obstacles."
Flashback begins.
Reaper says: "Choose your dueling weapon!"
Jake says: "Uh..."
Jake says: "I choose..."
Jake says: "sandwich!"
Jake says: "The challenges were impossible for me."
Goblin King challenges Jake to spitting their spit the farthest and laughs when Jake throws a pathetic spit.
A monster makes Jake chase a laser pointer, which leads Jake to bump into a wall.
Jake says: "But you would have blown right through."
Jake says: "I kept thinking to myself, "What would Finn do?"
Jake says: "" Just..."
Jake says: "eh, frustrating."
Jake says: "Know what I mean?"
Finn says: "Yeah..."
Finn says: "I think I do."
A "NEWFOUND RESPECT" logo pops up as they awkwardly handshake.
Finn says: "Now let's find a way out of this cage."
Jake says: "I'll get us out with Key Hand!"
Finn says: "I really don't see any key holes on this cage."
Jake says: "Not a problem, man."
Jake says: "Lock Hand!"
Finn says: "I'll get us out of here, with carrot hand!"
Jake says: "Alright, man."
Jake says: "Let's go!"
Jake says: "We've still got a couple minutes left to steal that crystal eye and win your bet!"
Finn says: "Wait!"
Finn says: "You'd help me win a bet that I made that I said I could accomplish something without you?"
Jake says: "Just hop on my powdered doughnut, boy!"
Finn says: "Cling!"
Finn laughs, and Jake carries him to the chamber of the crystal eye.
Jake says: "Alright, man."
Jake says: "Let's give this crystal eye the old friendship lift."
Finn says: "Okay."
Both says: "Friendship, go!"
Demonic Eye Creatures fly out and Finn and Jake try to kill them, but they melt their weapons.
Finn says: "If I die, I'll have died with my best friend!"
Jake says: "Me, too!"
Princess Bubblegum flies in on her swan, angry.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Get on my swan!"
Finn and Jake hop on her swan, which kills all the eye creatures with laser eyes.
Princess Bubblegum says: "I hope you learned a lesson from all this!"
Both says: "Uh, we learned that working together is better."
Both says: "Heh, whatever."
Princess Bubblegum growls.
Jake says: "Looks like that's not the answer she wanted."
Finn says: "Uhh..."
Finn says: "I learned that you're a very..."
Finn says: "intelligent princess?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "You're darn right I am."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Princess Bubblegum, away!!"
The three break out of the dungeon riding the swan. "ADVENTURE TIME" logo pops up just as the episode ends.
