The episode begins with two candy helicopters hovering above Finn, Jake, Princess Bubblegum, who are hiding behind a Banana Guard barricade in front of a candy store in the Candy Kingdom. Inside the building is Cookie, holding several candy people hostage and walking around with a cudgel. He squints through the glass doors.
Cookie says: "Donkin' Princess..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Okay, okay."
Princess Bubblegum says: "How about I give you a big cowboy hat?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Then will you let the hostages go?"
Cookie says: "Don't play games with me, Princess."
Cookie says: "I want that crown."
Cookie says: "No crown, no hostages."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Well, obviously that's going to be a problem, because I'm the princess and I need my crown."
Princess Bubblegum says: "So..."
Cookie says: "No, Princess!"
Cookie says: "You are problem—"
Cookie says: "the problem princess!"
Jake says: "Why does he want your crown anyway, Princess?"
Finn says: "Yeah, what's his beef?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I don't know, guys—"
Princess Bubblegum says: "he's crazy."
Princess Bubblegum says: "He's left me no choice."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm sending in the banana guards."
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's about to turn crazy nasty."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hello."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Captain Banana Guard?"
Jake says: "Wait a second, Princess."
Jake says: "Why don't me and Finn just sneak in there incognito and neutralize the threat, old-fashioned spy guy-style?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hmm."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Okay, but if you guys aren't out of there by  4:00, I'm sending in the guards."
Jake says: "dress up like a mailman."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Yeah, and I could wear all black and I could be like, you know, like, your shadow."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hmm."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I can't really see that working."
Jake says: "Yeah, the shadow thing might be pushin' it."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, no-no-no, that part's fine."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I was talking about you dressing up like a mailman."
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "But I always wanted to be a mailman."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Nah, you don't look like a mailman."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You look like a milkman."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Let's get you a proper milkman outfit."
Finn and Jake put on their respective disguises. Finn lies on the ground behind Jake, pretending to be his shadow.
Jake says: "You ready?"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Let's bust it."
They enter the candy store.
Jake says: "Hello."
Cookie says: ""Hello"?!"
Cookie says: "!"
Cookie says: "Who the heck are you?"
Cookie says: "I'm gonna smash your face."
Jake says: "Uhh, milkman, sir."
Jake says: "I brought the milk—"
Jake says: "for the hostages, sir."
Cookie says: "Huh?"
Cookie says: "Oh."
Cookie says: "I thought maybe you were a spy guy or somethin'."
Cookie says: "Go ahead, give everyone some milk, then get the math outta here."
Jake says: "Yes, sir."
Jake says: "Milk, sir?"
Marshmallow says: "Thanks."
Jake says: "Milk?"
Candy Person #103 says: "Thanks."
Jake says: "Milk?"
Marc says: "Thank you."
Jake says: "Some milk?"
Finn says: "Psst!"
Finn says: "Get ready, Jake."
Finn says: "When we get to the cookie, you throw some milk in his face and yell, "Alvin's hot juice box."
Finn says: "Alvin's hot juice box."
Finn says: "" He'll be really confused, and that's when we grab him and tie him up-style."
Static is heard coming from Cookie's radio.
Chipper says: "Come in, Cookie."
Chipper says: "This is Chipper."
Chipper says: "Over."
Cookie says: "Go ahead, Chipper."
Cookie says: "Over."
Chipper says: "I'm too short to lock the back door."
Chipper says: "Over."
Cookie says: "Hold tight, Chipper."
Cookie says: "Chipler's on his way."
Cookie says: "You got that, Chipler?"
Chipler says: "Affirmative."
Jake says: "Did you hear that?"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Change of plans—"
Finn says: "I'll go take care of those chips."
Finn says: "You keep the cookie distracted."
Jake says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "I can do that."
Finn says: "Okay, awesome."
Finn scoots along the floor toward the back of the store as Jake continues handing out milk.
Jake says: "Milk?"
Jake says: "Milk?"
Jake says: "Some milk?"
Cookie says: "What?"
Cookie says: "Oh."
Cookie says: "Look, you should probably split, buddy."
Cookie says: "Things are about to get pretty flipped out in here."
Jake says: "Oh, sure."
Jake says: "Sorry, man."
Jake says: "I was just trying to get away from that rotten Princess Bubblegum for a while, y'know?"
Jake says: "Isn't she just the worst?"
Cookie says: "Wait, you hate Princess Bubblegum, too?"
Cookie says: "Get outta here!"
Jake says: "Oh, yeah, man, she's the worst."
Jake says: "Sittin' out there all safe and cozy while I'm riskin' my life tootin' around in here in this stupid milkman costume."
Cookie says: "Wait—"
Cookie says: "costume?!"
Cookie says: "!"
Jake says: "Oh, um..."
Jake says: "I just mean it feels like a costume..."
Jake says: "'cause I wanted to be a mailman so bad, ya see?"
Jake says: "But the princess—"
Jake says: "she made me be a milkman anyway."
Cookie says: "Boy, I hear ya, brother."
Chipolina says: "Cookie, you there?"
Chipolina says: "Over."
Cookie says: "Yeah."
Cookie says: "Go ahead, Chipolina."
Cookie says: "Over."
Chipolina says: "I just saw a light go on in the stock room—"
Chipolina says: "probably nothing."
Chipolina says: "I'll check it out."
Chipolina says: "Over."
Cookie says: "Okay."
Cookie says: "Over."
Chipolina is shown entering the stock room. A lit nightlight is in the standing middle of the room. She looks around.
Chipolina says: "Hmm."
Finn is seen on the ceiling above Chipolina. He drops down.
Scene changes back to Jake and Cookie.
Jake says: "So what's your story, man?"
Jake says: "How'd she doodie on you?"
Cookie says: "I was just a kid, man, just a little kid, when I got doodied on."
Flashback begins, showing several candy children lying around in a room with cracks in the walls.
Cookie says: "I was the new guy at the Candy Orphanage."
Cookie says: "They called me Baby Snaps."
Cookie says: "I tried to make friends with the other kids..."
Baby Snaps says: "C'mon, guys, let's dance it up!"
Cookie says: "They were always too depressed to play."
Candy Child says: "No, no."
Candy Child says: "We're too depressed."
Baby Snaps stops dancing and sits on the couch, depressed.
Cookie says: "Things went on like that for a while, then..."
Cookie says: "one day..."
Cookie says: "Everything was different."
Princess Bubblegum says: "..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "a thunderous cheer  as Baby Whoozlefut..."
Cookie says: "Everything was-was better with her around."
Cookie says: "And something inside me changed that day, too."
Cookie says: "And then later she told me I could be anything I wanted."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Anything your sweet heart desires!"
Cookie says: "And I told her I wanted to be a princess like her, so I could make all the children happy."
Baby Snaps says: "I wanna be a princess like you!"
Baby Snaps' smile changes to a shocked frown.
Cookie says: "And she laughed in my face, man!"
Cookie says: "It really messed me up."
Flashback ends and Cookie is now crying silently.
Jake says: "Holy shmow, man."
Jake says: "That's terrible."
Jake says: "That's really terrible."
Jake says: "Listen, I—"
Cookie says: "She LIED to me!"
Jake says: "Yeah, but, maybe she didn't realize how much it meant to you."
Cookie says: "I'm about to flip out, man..."
Cookie says: "and take that crown!"
Jake says: "Whoa, whoa, wait!"
Jake says: "It doesn't have to be like this!"
Jake says: "You don't need that crown."
Jake says: "You could start over, man."
Jake says: "You can start a new kingdom—"
Jake says: "your own kingdom..."
Jake says: "where everyone can be whatever they wanna be."
Jake says: "I can be the mailman..."
Jake says: "and you?"
Jake says: "You can be the princess."
Jake says: "And—"
Cookie says: "My own kingdom?"
Jake says: "Yeah, man."
Cookie says: "I..."
Cookie says: "I'd like that."
Jake says: "Okay, then."
Jake says: "Just sit tight, Princess."
Jake says: "I'll get us outta here."
Jake says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "I'm comin' out!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "What?"
Jake walks out through the doors toward her.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Jake?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Jake, what's going on?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Where's Finn?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Where are the hostages?"
Jake says: "Don't worry, Princess."
Jake says: "It's okay now."
Jake says: "Princess Cookie's gonna go away."
Jake says: "You just gotta give him a horse to escape with and he'll go."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Right..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "and then you and Finn hunt him down and put him in the dungeon."
Jake says: "No, wait."
Jake says: "He said he'd go away forever."
Jake says: "Can't we just let him go?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "No."
Princess Bubblegum says: "That cookie is a menace."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Once the hostages are safe, Cookie goes in my dungeon—"
Princess Bubblegum says: "in my dungeon for his life."
Scene changes to Jake and Cookie exiting the candy store. Cookie is carrying the marshmallow hostage and holding his cudgel to its head.
Cookie says: "Oh, boy!"
Cookie says: "Would ya look at that?"
A strange candy horse is shown. Around its waist is a banana guard-esque band and protruding from its belly is a hand holding a spear. Princess Bubblegum and a banana guard are standing next to it.
Cookie says: "Dang!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Okay, well..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "she's all yours!"
Cookie says: "Hot diggity!"
Jake says: "Ah-ah-ah!"
Jake says: "Man, that horse ain't no good; that's a trap horse."
The horse's pupils dilate and its tongue sticks out.
Cookie says: "What are we gonna do?"
Jake says: "It's okay, man, I'm Jake."
Jake says: "J-J-J-Jingo Jango!"
Cookie says: "Whoa!"
Cookie says: "Ha HA!"
Cookie says: "You're magic!"
Jake jumps toward some banana guards, toppling them as Cookie laughs. Jake then jumps over the wall of the Candy Kingdom.
Princess Bubblegum says: "After them!"
Jake and Cookie ride past the Cotton Candy Forest.
Cookie says: "We're really doing it!"
Finn appears in Jake's shadow and hops onto Jake's back behind Cookie, unbeknownst to the latter. Jake moves his face between Finn and Cookie to talk to Finn.
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "What are you doing?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "What happened to the plan?"
Jake says: "New plan—"
Jake says: "I'm gonna help Princess Cookie escape."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "But-but he's a criminal!"
Jake says: "No, man, Princess Cookie's a good guy."
Jake says: "He just got dealt a bad hand."
Jake says: "He's only trying to be what following how his dreams make you want to be, man!"
Finn says: "Whaaaat?"
Jake says: "You're either with us or against us."
Finn says: "Um..."
Finn says: "'gainst?"
Finn says: "WAAAH!"
Finn says: "Oof."
Several banana guards are seen chasing after them. Cookie and Jake cross a shallow river.
Jake says: "Hold on tight, Cookie!"
Jake says: "I'm gonna jump the gorge!"
A ravine is shown ahead of them. Cookie's smile disappears.
Cookie says: "No, Jake."
Cookie says: "Stop the horse."
Jake says: "I can make it!"
Cookie pulls on Jake's skin like reins, causing Jake to fall and throwing Cookie towards the edge of the ravine. Jake shape-shifts back to normal with the exception of his hind legs and runs over to Cookie.
Jake says: "Princess Cookie!"
Jake says: "Are you all right?"
Cookie says: "I'm done for, Jake."
The banana guards get closer.
Jake says: "No, everything's gonna be fine."
Jake says: "I won't let them put you in the dungeon."
Jake says: "Just let me talk to them."
Cookie says: "No, Jake."
Jake stops and turns back.
Cookie says: "Thank you for your help, but it's too late for me."
The banana guards are shown crossing the river.
Cookie says: "I'll never be a princess."
Cookie says: "At least for a moment, you helped me feel like a princess."
Cookie says: "It was wonderful."
Cookie says: "Thank you, Jake."
Cookie takes a step back and a piece of dirt crumbles under his foot and falls into the ravine.
Jake says: "Careful, Princess!"
Cookie says: "You know what?"
Cookie says: "It's funny, but you sort of remind me of a mailman I used to know."
Jake says: "I do?"
Cookie says: "Yep."
Jake says: "Princess!"
The screen goes black as Cookie falls, slo-mo, and crashes to the bottom.
Scene cuts to Banana guards standing around and taking pictures of Cookie's shattered remains at the bottom of the gorge.
Cookie says: "I glubbed up!"
Scene changes to Jake, dressed as a mailman, walking up to the Candy Kingdom Mental Hospital. Inside, Cookie is in a straitjacket playing chess with Chocolate Covered Banana. One of his chips moves the pieces for him.
Cookie says: "Knight to E-5."
Jake says: "Where's Baby Snaps?"
Doctor Princess points him out.
Jake says: "Excuse, me!"
Jake says: "Your highness!"
Cookie says: "Jake!"
Cookie walks over to Jake, who hugs him.
Jake says: "Oh, hey."
Jake says: "Check it out!"
Jake says: "Special delivery from the Grass Kingdom!"
Jake pulls out a flower twisted into a tiara. The patients and Cookie gasp. Jake places it on Cookie's head, takes off his hat, and genuflects.
Various Patients says: "He's a princess?"
Various Patients says: "I had no idea."
Various Patients says: "Royalty!"
All the patients approach Cookie as Finn and Princess Bubblegum are shown peeking in through the door.
The patients surround Cookie and bow or genuflect to him.
Episode ends.
