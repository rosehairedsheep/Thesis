Princess Bubblegum, lying in the chair, shrugs at Lumpy Space Princess.
LSP says: "Grr."
A copyright warning comes up on the screen.
Princess Bubblegum says: "What's that?"
Finn says: "Just stuff that comes at the beginning of the movies."
Jake says: "Yeah, that's on all the movies we dig up."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I don't know."
Princess Bubblegum says: "It seems pretty important, Finn."

Finn says: "Jake and I just have to find a movie without that warning."
The club members are happy and leave.
Jake says: "Dude, we've never found a movie without that warning."
Finn says: "We're not gonna find a movie, Jake."
In the Tree Fort's treasure room, Finn is digging through a pile of gold coins.

Jake says: "Wait, that's not what I said."
Finn says: "Let's get to filming!"
At a waterfall, Slime Princess at the top of the waterfall.
Finn says: "Okay, Slime Princess!"
Finn says: "In this scene, you're gonna leap over to that vine, swim over the crocodiles, do a triple flip with a full twist and land clean."

Finn says: "Action!"
Slime Princess jumps and falls into the water where crocodiles leap at her, Finn and Jake are mouth agape, a crocodile rises out of the water with Slime Princess kissing its snout.
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "No smooching!"
Finn says: "Cut."
Jake says: "I thought it was great."
Finn says: "No, we can't use any of it."
Jake says: "I think we should use all of it."
Finn says: "No, not all."
Finn says: "We should throw away the parts where Slime Princess was smoochin'."
Finn says: "That was dumb."
Jake says: "What?"
Finn says: "Duuuumb-ah."
In a clearing, Lumpy Space Princess and Peppermint Butler are at a picnic setting.

Jake says: "What's next?"
In the next scene, BMO is in a hole by a frog tied to a chariot, Finn is positioning the frog and adjusting the camera; Princess Bubblegum is standing on the side of the frog.
Finn says: "Okay PB, move back a little."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Princess Bubblegum says: "How does this work?"
Finn says: "Umm, Jake's gonna get the frog to hop toward him  and when he does, you're gonna run along side the chariot and it's gonna look like you're driving it."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Okay."
Jake says: "Hey, Finn."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "How 'bout when the chariot takes off, she says something like, "Mmm, check, please."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "No, that's terrible."
Finn says: "And action!"
Jake put the fly in front of the frog and it shoots its tongue at the fly and the tongue's recoil causes it to fall back on the chariot, breaking it, and the frog hops away.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Check, please..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "?"
Finn says: "Hah, Jake."
Finn says: "You..."
Finn says: "you brought the fly in too close!"
Jake says: "I'm sorry."
Finn says: "Well, help me catch 'im."
They chase after the frog.
Jake says: "Well, I thought it was funny."
Finn says: "This isn't a comedy!"
Jake says: "Not the way you're shootin' it."
Finn says: "Look, just help me catch this guy."
Jake says: "All right, but after this we do my part."
In a wedding scene.
Jake says: "."
Jake says: "But we are makin' a movie, and this is the big wedding scene."
Jake says: "Mr."
Jake says: "Cupcake, you're playing Todd Johnson."
Mr. Cupcake says: "Yes."
Jake says: "And Lady, you confess that you never loved Todd Johnson and that you were just trying to win a bet with your snooty socialite friends."
Lady Rainicorn says: "알았어, 제이크."
Jake says: "And then, you both realize you do love each other and you both say "I do."
Jake says: "" And then Shelby, you say..."
Shelby says: "Check, please."
Jake says: "Heh, heh, heh."
Jake says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "Don't forget to look right at the camera and slap your cheeks like this."
Jake says: "And 1, 2, 3 action!"
Shelby stares angrily at Jake since he doesn't have hands to slap his cheeks.
Shelby says: "Do you, Todd Johnson, take this Rainicorn to be your lawfully married wife?"
Mr. Cupcake starts to flex his eyebrows; Lady giggles and blushes; Mr. Cupcake begins to flex and pose his muscles; Jake looks uncomfortable.
Jake says: "Lady!"
Jake says: "Cut!"
Jake says: "Cut, cut, cut!"
Jake says: "I didn't tell you to flex out!"
Jake says: "No, I don't like the way he's flexing at you."
Mr. Cupcake says: "I don't hear her complaining."
Jake says: "Why you..."
Jake says: "GAAH!"
Jake tackles Mr. Cupcake, the camera switches to Shelby as sounds of a fight can be heard.
Shelby says: "Check, please."

Jake says: "Okay."
Finn says: "I think we shot a lot of great stuff."
Jake says: "Uh-huh."
Finn says: "But I'm thinkin' only half of it is usable."
Jake says: "Me, too."
Finn says: "Really?"
Jake says: "Yeah, I was just thinking that."
Finn says: "That's great!"
Jake says: "I know."
Finn says: "You actually agree it's an action adventure!"

Jake says: "No!"
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "Romantic comedy!"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "What do you mean "what"?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Who's right, BMO?"
Jake says: "Yeah, me or Finn?"
Finn says: "We'll ask him when he wakes up."
Jake says: "Why wait?"
Jake says: ""Dear BMO, Please use only the best footage when cutting the movie."
Jake says: "Love, Jake."
Finn takes the pen and paper.
Finn says: ""And Finn."
Jake says: "See you at the movie club, then."
Finn says: "Oh, I'll be there."

Jake says: "Right, BMO?"
BMO says: "Eeee..."
Finn says: "Well, I guess we'll see!"
Jake says: "Yeah, I guess we will."
Jake says: "Start the movie, BMO."
The club members clap and look nervous; Finn and Jake go to their seats.
LSP says: "It's a little awkward."
BMO sighs and presses a button on itself and its face shoots out rays of light; the crowd is impressed; electricity goes through a cord from BMO to a holograph player; the logo "A BFF Production" appears.
LSP says: "Oh, my gosh!"
BMO sings "Friends" and plays clips of Finn and Jake and the video ends; the club applauds.
Finn says: "BMO's right."
Finn says: "Fighting over this movie junk is dumb."
Finn says: "I'm sorry, man."
Jake says: "Me too, dude."
Finn and Jake hug.
LSP says: "Oh, my gosh, you guys."
LSP says: "I can't wait till next week's movie club."
