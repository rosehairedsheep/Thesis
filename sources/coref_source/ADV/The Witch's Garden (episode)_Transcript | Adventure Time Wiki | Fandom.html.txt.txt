The episode begins with a frog carrying a crown walking with Finn and Jake following behind.
Jake says: "Dude..."
Jake says: "how long are we gonna follow this frog?"
Finn says: "I just wanna see 'im put on that crown."
The frog walks through the bars of a locked gate.
Finn says: "Wooow!"
Jake says: "Wooow!"
Jake says: "It looks cool in there!"
Finn says: "Too bad we don't have the key to this."
Jake says: "What're you talkin' about?"
Jake says: "I got two keys right here!"
Finn laughs and gets on Jake's back. Jake stretches over the wall of the garden.
Finn says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Finn and Jake land inside the garden.
Jake says: "Wow!"
Jake says: "Look at this place!"
Finn says: "Jake."
Finn says: "Are these donuts?"
Jake says: "They look like donuts."
Finn says: "But maybe they're poisonous donuts!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Sniff it, Jake!"
Finn says: "Suck up those toxins!"
Jake sniffs it thoroughly.
Jake says: "Wait a second..."
Jake says: "I don't know what poison smells like."
Witch says: "Hey!"
Witch says: "Razzamafoo!"
She switches places with Finn and Jake.
Jake says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "What gives?!"
Finn says: "!"
Witch says: "You ate one of my donuts!"
Jake says: "No, I didn't."
Jake says: "I just sniffed it."
Witch says: "RAAAAAGH!!"
Witch says: "You're lying!"
Witch says: "The stink of magic dog lips is everywhere!"
Finn says: "Holy slug, lady!"
Finn says: "Calm down!"
Jake says: "Listen, Mrs."
Jake says: "Witch."
Witch says: "I never married!"
Jake says: "Well, I never ate your donuts."
Witch says: "You..."
Witch says: "you're eating one right now!"
Witch says: "MAGICUS NOMORICUS!"
Jake says: "Uh-oh."
Finn says: "AAH!"
Finn says: "Dude, are you okay?"
Jake says: "Yeah..."
Jake says: "I think so."
Jake says: "Just a little chilly."
Jake says: "WHOA!"
Witch says: "Ahahahahahehehe!"
Finn says: "What did she do to you?"
Witch says: "I stripped him of his magical powers!"
Finn says: "For stealing one of your billions of donuts?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Yeah, it's not like I killed your husband or somethin'."
Witch says: "I AM NOT MARRIED!"
Finn says: "The point is you overreacted."
Jake says: "And what gives?"
Jake says: "I used to have like eight more of these things."
Witch says: "The only way I'll give back your powers is if you admit your error and say you're sorry and mean it!"
Witch says: "..."
Witch says: "'Cause I can tell the difference."
Jake says: "Well, you can forget it because you're the one who's wrong!"
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "Right?"
Finn says: "Total support, dude."
Witch says: "Go-backicus-from-whence-you-came-icus!"
Finn says: "Aw, now you're just makin' these up!"
He and Jake disappear.
Finn says: "There's gotta be a way to get your powers back!"
Finn says: "Where'd they come from, anyway?"
Finn says: "Were you born with them?"
Finn says: "Or..."
Finn says: "did you have a freak industrial accident?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Ha."
Jake says: "That takes me back."
Jake says: "Let me just..."
Jake says: "Whoo..."
Jake says: "Remembering is hard work."
Finn says: "What happened next?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Oh."
Jake says: "Um..."
Jake says: "I went into the mud, and..."
Jake says: "I guess I became a magic dog?"
Finn says: "Okay!"
Finn says: "Then our course is clear!"
Finn says: "We'll roll you in every mud puddle in Ooo until we find the one that'll restore your powers."
Jake says: "That's nuts, man."
Jake says: "You got any idea of how many mud puddles are in the land of Ooo?"
Jake says: "Four?"
Jake says: "Maybe even five?"
Finn says: "Jake, come on!"
Finn says: "We've always been lucky, buddy!"
Finn says: "Maybe the first mud puddle we find will be the right one!"
Jake says: "Nonsense..."
Jake says: "but I like it!"
Finn says: "Then away!"
Finn says: "Hyuh!"
Finn says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Jake says: "Yeah, let's do it!"
Finn lands on his feet; Jake lands on his face with a thud.
Finn says: "Oh, my gosh!"
Jake says: "I forgot that I don't have magic powers anymore."
Jake says: "How do we search for the mud without my powers?"
Finn says: "We run!"
Finn says: "Run like energetic little boys!"
Jake says: "Running..."
Jake says: "is..."
Jake says: "evil..."
Finn says: "Come on, lazy bones!"
Jake says: "It's too hard!"
Finn says: "I guess you could ride on my backpack."
Jake says: "You good, Finn?"
Finn says: "You're..."
Finn says: "strangling me..."
Finn says: "a little, is all."
Scene transition to the River of Junk.
Finn says: "Look there!"
Finn says: "Across the River of Junk!"
Finn says: "There's an ideal mud puddle."
Jake says: "I'll stretch into a boat!"
Jake says: "I'm startin' to really miss that old magic of mine."
Finn says: "We can swim this river easy!"
Jake says: "Man, that looks exhausting."
A projection of Jake's subconscious appears on a piece of furniture in the river.
Jake's subconscious says: "You're right, Jake."
Jake's subconscious says: "It is exhausting."
Jake says: "What are you?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake's subconscious says: "I'm your subconscious!"
Jake says: "Okay, what are you doing here?"
Jake's subconscious says: "I'm here to tell you that what you're feeling deep down inside is true!"
Jake's subconscious says: "It is way too hard to swim across the river."
Jake's subconscious says: "It's easier to wear a hat."
Jake's subconscious says: "Here!"
Jake's subconscious says: "Have a hat!"
Jake says: "Ha ha!"
Jake says: "Yeah-hea-hea-hea!"
his subconscious says: "Yeah-hea-hea-hea!"
Jake says: "Heh heh!"
his subconscious says: "Heh heh!"
Jake says: "Man, I'm glad I met you."
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Stop talking to yourself!"
Finn says: "Cross over already!"
Jake says: "Uh, I can't swim that river, dude."
Jake says: "My subconscious says it's too hard."
Jake says: "Check out this hat, though."
Finn says: "Then just wait for me there!"
Finn dives down and begins gathering various things. When he grabs a trash can lid, a large eye is uncovered and it opens. Finn re-surfaces and begins building something, mumbling to himself and visibly annoyed. "Ergh, stupid...".
Jake says: "Whatcha workin' on, Finn?"
Jake says: "Mud-venture!"
Finn says: "Did it work?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Oh, yeah!"
Jake says: "I can feel this workin'!"
Jake says: "In fact, you should roll in the mud with me, Finn!"
Jake says: "We can both be magic!"
Finn says: "YEAAAAH!"
Finn says: "This isn't working at all."
Jake says: "This isn't the right mud."
Jake says: "I was just really hopin' this was over and done."
Finn says: "Okay..."
Finn says: "Then let's just go find another mud puddle."
Jake says: "Actually..."
Jake says: "I'm feeling kinda chubby-tired."
Jake says: "Can't we do this tomorrow?"
Finn says: "Agh!"
Finn says: "This is stupid!"
Finn says: "Just go back to the witch and apologize and get your powers back!"
Jake says: "Never!"
Jake says: "I'd rather be powerless forever then apologize!"
Jake says: "I'm lazy but prideful."
Finn says: "a-and now you keep—"
Finn says: "and..."
Finn says: "a-and no matter what, I ju—"
Finn says: "you..."
Jake says: "Adventuring is too much hard work for a bro without his powers."
Finn says: "But you are an adventurer."
Jake says: "Nah, from now on, I'm just your regular old dog."
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "Ironic given my current man-baby body."
Something big emerges from the river; Finn and Jake gasp. A giant pile of junk emerges and a giant living fish skeleton pops out of it.
Gary says: "Behold the beautiful mermaid of the river."
Gary says: "all this?"
Gary says: "Heh heh heh..."
Finn says: "Oh, um..."
Finn says: "How do I say, "You're the grossest thing ever," without offending you?"
Gary says: "RAAAAAARGH!!"
Gary angrily conjures up a fireball.
Jake says: "I'll scare her off, Finn!"
Gary blasts them but they evade.
Finn says: "How do we beat power like that?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "I've got an idea!"
Finn says: "What is it, buddy??"
Jake says: "Rub my belly!"
Jake says: "Yeah, I'm one of those kinda dogs."
Finn growls angrily.
Finn says: "YAAAAH!"
Gary evades his attack and spits a black substance on him, knocking him out. Gary cackles.
Jake says: "Finn?"
Jake says: "I'll save you!"
Finn says: "Jake?"
Jake says: "Don't worry!"
Jake says: "Hey, Finn..."
Jake says: "Can you help me to get up there?"
The Hatchlings hatch.
Hatchlings says: "Hungry!"
Hatchlings says: "Hungry!"
Hatchlings says: "Hungry!"
Jake says: "If only I had my powers back!"
Witch says: "The only way I'll give back your powers is if—"
Jake says: "I know, I know!"
Jake says: "I have to apologize to that Witch."
Scene transition to the Witch's garden. The Witch is planting a cupcake.
Witch says: "Oh, you're doing so well..."
Witch says: "and I hate you so much!!"
Jake says: "Witch!"
Jake says: "I need my powers back!"
Jake says: "So I'm sorry!"
Jake says: "I'm so sorry I ate your donut!"
Witch says: "Razzamafoo."
Jake appears in front of the Witch.
Jake says: "So do I get my powers back?!"
Jake says: "!"
Witch says: "Mmm..."
Witch says: "Apology denied."
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Why?!"
Jake says: "!"
Witch says: "Because you took too long."
Witch says: "Now you have to apologize while doing a variety of humiliating things."
Jake says: "No way, Jose!"
Jake's subconscious says: "Come on, dude."
Jake's subconscious says: "It's the only way to save Finn."
Witch says: "Who is that?!"
Witch says: "!"
Jake says: "He's my subconscious."
Witch says: "Then he has to do it too."
Jake's subconscious says: "Aw..."
Scene transition. Jake is dancing with his subconscious with flowers in his underwear.
Jake says: "I, Jake the dog, while slow-dancing with my subconscious, with flowers in my underwear, do humbly apologize..."
Witch says: "Wait, wait."
Witch says: "Start over."
Jake says: "You're recording this?!"
Jake says: "!"
Witch says: "It's for my newsletter."
Jake says: "No way."
Jake says: "I have my dignity."
Witch says: "Then guess what, cool guy?"
Witch says: "You can forget about getting your powers back..."
Witch says: "EVER!!"
Jake says: "Oh, no, dude!"
Jake says: "What do we do now?"
His subconscious starts coughing and falls over.
Jake's subconscious says: "I'm dyin', Jake."
Jake says: "Wha?!"
Jake says: "!"
Witch says: "Hm."
Witch says: "He says he's dying."
Witch says: "Let that be a lesson to all you cupcakes."
Witch says: "Hah..."
Jake says: "Why are you dying, bro?"
Jake's subconscious says: "Because..."
Jake's subconscious says: "I'm the subconscious of your old magical self."
Jake's subconscious says: "Goodbye, Jake..."
Jake says: "No!"
Jake says: "No!"
Witch says: "So I've finally broken you."
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "If only..."
Jake says: "I were a humbler guy, my subconscious would be alive, and my best bud wouldn't be trapped in a mermaid's nest!"
Witch says: "YES!"
Witch says: "GLOAT, GLOAT, GLOAT!"
Witch says: "Alright, I think you've learned your lesson."
Witch says: "I forgive you."
Jake regains his fur.
Jake says: "Ha!"
Jake says: "Got your cane!"
Witch says: "WHAAA!"
Witch says: "OOF!"
Witch says: "But didn't you learn your lesson?!"
Witch says: "!"
Witch says: "?"
Jake says: "NOPE!!!"
Scene transition back to the nest. Finn wakes up.
Hatchlings says: "Hungry!"
Hatchlings says: "Hungry!"
Finn screams.
Gary says: "Remember to save the brain for dessert."
The Hatchlings move towards Finn. Finn trembles in terror.
Jake says: "Honey, I'm back!"
Jake says: "How about a big kiss?"
Jake says: "You guys are so cute!"
Jake says: "I could just maul you to death!"
The Hatchlings run away.
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "I never should have doubted you!"
Jake says: "Well, I'm glad you learned your lesson: that in a crunch, there's nothin' I wouldn't do for ya."
Finn says: "Ahhh, so is that how you got your powers back?"
Finn says: "You apologized to the witch?"
Jake says: "Uh..."
