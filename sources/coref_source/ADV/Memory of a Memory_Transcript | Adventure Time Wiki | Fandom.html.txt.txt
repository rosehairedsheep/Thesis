Finn and Rag Wizard are riding on Jake's shoulders, Jake is running.
Rag Wizard says: "Faster!"
Rag Wizard says: "Faster!"
Rag Wizard says: "She's in danger!"
Jake says: "Who is he talking about?"
Finn says: "I have no idea."
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Then why am I running so hard?"
Finn says: "Because..."
Rag Wizard says: "Because she's in trouble!"
Finn says: "Who is?!"
Jake says: "Who is?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "!"
Rag Wizard says: "Marceline!"
Finn says: "Faster, Jake!"
Jake says: "She's in trouble!"
Jake says: "Hey, wizard, how do you know Marceline?"
Rag Wizard says: "I'm her spirit animal."
Jake says: "Oh."
They arrive at Marceline's house, Marceline lying on her floor.
Finn says: "Marceline!"
Finn says: "What's wrong with her?"
Rag Wizard says: "She accidentally cast a sleep spell on herself, and now she's trapped in eternal slumber."
Finn says: "Tell us how to break the spell."
Rag Wizard says: "I'll transport you into Marceline's mind where you will walk through her memories and find the memory core."
Jake says: "Then what?"
Rag Wizard says: "Find the memory of Marceline casting the sleep spell on herself."
Rag Wizard says: "At your touch, you and the memory will be transported back to reality."
Jake says: "But, like, if you know all this, why not just do it yourself?"
Rag Wizard says: "Entering a person's mind can be dangerous, and I don't have any arms."
Rag Wizard says: "Just legs."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "What'd you do to my forehead?"
Rag Wizard says: "When you get close to the memory, your forehead will glow."
Rag Wizard says: "Here, take this."
Rag Wizard says: "It's a sack of magic powder."
Rag Wizard says: "Sit on the couch and sprinkle the powder on your head."
Finn and Jake walk over to the couch and sits on it.
Finn says: "Like this?"
Rag Wizard says: "Yep, like that."
Rag Wizard says: "Feel sleepy?"
Finn says: "Mmhm."
Jake says: "Mmhm."
Rag Wizard says: "Good."
Rag Wizard says: "Sleep now."
Rag Wizard says: "But know this!"
Rag Wizard says: "If you fail, Marceline will be trapped in eternal sleep..."
Rag Wizard says: "forever!"
Rag Wizard says: "And ever."
Rag Wizard says: "And ever."
Finn and Jake fall into darkness, sleeping. Lights come on.
Jake says: "Did it work?"
Finn says: "Ugh, ah."
Finn says: "I can't tell."
Finn says: "I don't feel like I'm inside Marceline's memories."
Jake says: "Me neither."
Jake says: "Huh?"
They walk beside the couch, which extends into a destroyed town-like area.
Jake says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "So..."
Finn says: "if we're in Marceline's memories, where's Marceline?"
Jake says: "Hmm..."
Jake says: "there she is!"
Jake says: "Hey, little Marcy."
Young Marceline says: "Who are you guys?"
Finn says: "We're Finn and Jake."
Jake says: "We're your friends!"
Young Marceline says: "Hambo is my only friend."
Young Marceline says: "See?"
Young Marceline says: "I'm hurting you because I love you."
Jake says: "Ahem!"
Young Marceline says: "What are you guys still doing here?"
Finn says: "We're trying to wake you up."
Jake says: "Do you know where your memory core is?"
Young Marceline says: "Nope, but there might be anything behind that cellar door, and it rhymes with memory core!"
Jake says: "Ooo!"
Jake says: "Ooo!"
Jake says: "Could be jams and pickles down there!"
Jake says: "Weird."
Jake says: "I think this door leads to a new memory; with food in it!"
Finn says: "I want some!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Come on, Finn!"
Finn and Jake enter a broken down restaurant, Hunson Abadeer is eating Marceline's fries.
Finn says: "Yo, man."
Hunson Abadeer says: "Wha?"
Finn says: "Don't eat those."
Teenage Marceline walks in, seeing her dad eating her fries.
Hunson Abadeer says: "Marceline!"
Teenage Marceline says: "Daddy, why?"
Finn and Jake enter a new memory located in the Tree Fort.
Finn says: "It's our treehouse."
Finn says: "This must be when Marceline lived here."
A slightly younger Marceline and Ash carry and put down chair in the room They fall on the chair.
Marceline says: "I'm so glad we're doing this, Ash."
Ash says: "Yeah, me too."
Ash says: "Oh, hey, wait."
Ash says: "Watch this--I've been practicing."
Rose says: "Marceline!"
Rose says: "I love, I love."
Marceline kisses Ash on the cheek; rose continues to say "I love".
Jake says: "Who's this guy supposed to be?"
Finn says: "Ash, I guess."
Finn and Jake enter a new room through a mouse hole to see Marceline sitting in a chair.
Finn says: "This place reeks."
Jake says: "Yo, man, your thing is glowing."
Finn says: "My what?"
Finn says: "Oh, my thing."

Ash says: "Hey, open your eyes, look at this, Mar-Mar."
Ash says: "Check it out."
Ash says: "It's my new wand."
Ash says: "These cherry blossoms, look, look as close as you can, and they're real."
Marceline says: "Wow."
Marceline says: "Awesome."
Marceline says: "Where'd you get the money for that thing?"
Ash says: "Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much."
Ash says: "To a Witch."
Marceline says: "You what?"
Marceline says: "Are you crazy?"
Marceline says: "That was my favorite thing in the whole world!"
Ash says: "That's why it's so valuable, genius--for potions."
A ghost comes out of the wand.
Cherry Blossom Ghost says: "You're not, a genius."
Cherry Blossom Ghost says: "You're not, a genius."
Marceline says: "That's the last straw, Ash!"
Marceline says: "That's it!"
Marceline says: "You're a psycho jerk, and you ruined my life."
Ash says: "But--but not all of it!"
Marceline says: "IT'S OVER, YOU PSYCHO!!"
Jake says: "This way, Finn!"
Jake says: "Check out this whacked out memory crack!"
Jake says: "It's ba-nay-nay down here!"
They enter Marceline's memory core.
Finn says: "The core!"
Jake says: "All these orbs must be her memories."
Finn says: "How are we supposed to know which one to grab?"
Jake says: "Play hot-cold with your forehead!"
Finn says: "Alright."
Finn says: "Hot or cold?"
Jake says: "Cold."
Jake says: "Definitely cold."
Finn continues moving.
Jake says: "Warmer."

Ash says: "That's a relief."
Marceline says: "Oh, Ash."
Finn says: "What?"
Ash says: "Don't you guys get it?"

Finn says: "Then I'll sneak in, and I'll rescue Marceline."
Tiny Goblin says: "My house!"

Marceline says: "Finn?"

Marceline says: "Ash doesn't like me hanging out with mere mortals."
Finn says: "Yeah, okay."
Finn says: "Sorry Marceline, I'll go."
Finn says: "I just gotta show you something first."
The powder puffs into a big cloud and they are transported to Finn's memories.
Marceline says: "Hello?"
Marceline says: "Finn?"
Marceline opens a door to see a baby Finn singing Baby Finn Song. She stops watching and starts laughing, Finn shows up.
Finn says: "Hey, there you are."
Marceline says: "Finn, what's going on?"
Marceline says: "What is this place?"
Finn says: "It's my old house."
Finn says: "That magic powder--it put you in my memories."
Finn says: "Me and Jake were in yours before, but Ash tricked us into stealing your memory of you breaking up with him."
Finn says: "But it's okay because I saw the memory."
Finn says: "Now I have a memory of your memory in my memory."
Finn says: "See?"
Ash says: "Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much."
Ash says: "To a witch."
Marceline says: "It's over, you psycho!!"
Marceline says: "Finn, I think I'd like to wake up now."
Finn and Marceline exit his memories and are walking out of Ash's house.
Finn says: "You gonna be okay, Marceline?"
Marceline says: "Yeah."
Marceline says: "Thanks, Finn, I..."
Ash says: "Yo, Mar-Mar."
Ash says: "What—"
Ash says: "What's with the chump?"
Ash says: "C'mon, I said no chumps."
Ash says: "Ash gets hungies at eight o' clock."
Ash says: "You need to get back in the kitchen and make me din-ner."
Ash says: "I want a turkey sandwich with to-ma-to."
Ash says: "Also pickles."
Steaming, Marceline kicks Ash in the crotch, Ash groans in pain. Ash falls down, and Marceline continues to kick him. Finn starts jumping on Ash.
Ash says: "Ohh..."
Ash says: "I can't see..."
Ash says: "Somebody call my mom!"
