The scene opens to Finn and Jake's Tree Fort. A bunch of Clown Nurses are acting around while circus music plays in the background. The head Clown Nurse is sitting by Finn. He is sitting in bed reading the Enchiridion, and his right foot is bandaged.
Head Clown Nurse says: "Who wants a cookie?"
Head Clown Nurse says: "Milk-dipped chocolate chip cookie?"
Finn says: "No thanks."
Head Clown Nurse says: "Now, come on, Finn."
Head Clown Nurse says: "You have to eat."
Head Clown Nurse says: "Open Sesame..."
Finn says: "Uh, Jake, can't we get rid of these Clown Nurses?"
Finn says: "They make me feel ridiculous."
The camera cuts to Jake. He, too, is sitting in bed, with his right foot bandaged. A big Clown Nurse is standing near him.
Jake says: "No way, man."
Finn groans in disgust.
Jake says: "Well, now you know we can't jump off of birds."
Jake says: "Look, she just farted."
Head Clown Nurse says: "Time for our love therapy."
Finn says: "Wait, what are they doing?"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Stop!"
Head Clown Nurse says: "Oh my!"
Head Clown Nurse says: "Did that hurt, dear?"
Finn says: "NO!!"
Finn says: "I just don't want you kissing my toe!"
Head Clown Nurse says: "Now, now, honey, you gotta understand."
Head Clown Nurse says: "This is the only way to "foo-foo" your boo-boo."
Finn says: "What does that even mean??"
Jake says: "I don't know..."
Jake says: "but I'm feeling better already."
Jake says: "Ah."
Jake says: "That tickles."
Big Clown Nurse says: "You want me to stop?"
Jake says: "No, keep going."
Finn says: "Look!"
Finn says: "Deep in the forest of trees, there's a Cyclops whose magical tears can heal any wound."
Finn says: "See?"
Finn says: "See?"
The head Clown Nurse takes the book from him.
Head Clown Nurse says: "Maybe you should leave the medical decisions to the medical professionals, and my professional prescription is..."
Head Clown Nurse says: "your toe needs crazy smooches!"
Head Clown Nurse says: "It's the only way!"
The Clown Nurses all gather around and start holding Finn down.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Wha?"
The head Clown Nurse gets near Finn's bandaged foot.
Finn says: "Wait!"
Finn says: "Wait!"
Finn says: "Wait!"
Finn says: "There's another way!"
Finn says: "There's my way!"
Finn says: "Let me show you my way!"
The head Clown Nurse starts smooching Finn's bandaged foot.
Finn says: "Ahh!"
Finn says: "Let me go!"
Head Clown Nurse says: "It's the only way!"
The head rises up and floats in front of him. Finn screams and runs in panic, but ends up falling into the mouth of the Clown Nurse's head.
Head Clown Nurse says: "It's the only way!"
Finn wakes up. The Head Clown Nurse is rapidly smooching Finn's foot. Finn gets up and the Clown nurses back off.
Finn says: "MY WAY!!"
He runs out of the house and into the forest, screaming. He finally comes to a stop. He's staring at a tree stump with a sign. The road splits up into two paths.
Finn says: "Hmmm..."
Tree Stump says: "Ring, ring!"
Tree Stump says: "Look, there's only two choices, bro."
Tree Stump says: "Take your pick."
Tree Stump says: "There's the path on the left, Hair Fall-Out Path."
Tree Stump says: "No more hair again, ever!"
Tree Stump says: "Or the path on the right, Smelly Path."
Tree Stump says: "Makes you smelly forever."
Tree Stump says: "Hoohoo, you won't believe it."
Finn says: "Isn't there another way?"
Tree Stump says: "Nope."
Finn says: "But what if I just went—"
Tree Stump says: "No, that's it!"
Tree Stump says: "You have to choose!"
Tree Stump says: "There's no other way!"
Tree Stump says: "Choosing is the only way."
Tree Stump says: "Choosing—"
Tree Stump says: "is the only—"
Tree Stump says: "way."
The camera zooms in on Finn's face. A thought of the head Clown Nurse crosses his mind.
Head Clown Nurse says: "It's the only way!"
Finn suddenly screams and confronts the tree stump.
Tree Stump says: "Hey, listen man, the Smelly Path's not actually that bad!"
Finn says: "NO!"
Finn says: "I choose MY WAY!!"
Finn says: "My way."
Finn runs right through the prickly bushes, screaming all the way. He comes out on the other side, all scratched and covered in thorns. He then comes across a river an walks up to the bank. A bush is on the bank nearby.
Bush says: "Ring ring."
Bush says: "Hello, dummy police?"
Bush says: "Yes, there's a strange dummy lurking around my house."
Bush says: "Okay, yes."
Bush says: "Thank you."
Bush says: "Goodbye."
Finn says: "Wha..."
Finn says: "?"
Finn says: "I need to cross the river."
Finn says: "The Cyclops is over there."
Bush says: "You can't cross this river."
Bush says: "It's impossible!"
Bush says: "Look!"
Bush says: "The current is so fast, it'll turn your butt inside-out for real, doofus."
Bush says: "And the water's so acidic it'll crump your boat in half."
Bush says: "It's like orange juice."
Bush says: "It's gross."
Bush says: "There's a bridge, but it's a trap!"
Bush says: "Plus, the water's jamming with electric eels."
Bush says: "Wow, so weird."
Bush says: "Anyway, that's it, there's no other way around, you dummy."
While the bush speaks, the camera shows the river's current flowing, and the steaming hull of a boat that was corroded away. The bridge nearby is shown, then two pairs of eyes and shadowy arms pop out. Two electric eels are swimming under the water, their bodies surging with electricity.
Finn says: "But I need to get across."
Bush says: "Listen what I'm telling you."
Bush says: "There's no way."
Bush says: "..."
Bush says: "Ugly tramp."
Another thought of a Clown Nurse crosses Finn's mind. He advances on the bush.
Finn says: "Glob, Glob it, Glob it, Glob it..."
Bush says: "Huh?"
Bush says: "What are you saying?"
Bush says: ""Globbit, Globbit"?"
Bush says: "Who's Globbit?"
Finn snatches the bush and uproots him.
Finn says: "MY WAY!!"
A screaming Finn then charges head-on into the river, using the bush to sweep the water off of the ground beneath. The bush is screaming in pain all the while. Then some electric eels jump out of the water and wrap themselves around Finn, shocking him and singing off the bush's leaves. Finn finally stops on a rock and the eels come off of him. Finn spits out a glob of vomit into the water.
Bush says: "Glibby glob, man!"
Bush says: "You're crazy!"
Bush says: "We're not even half way across!"
Bush says: "You gotta go back, man!"
Bush says: "It's the only way, you ugly fat-smelling fat-head!"
Finn says: "NO, MY WAY!!"
Finn says: "Oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob."
Pan says: "Uhh, excuse me, friend."
Pan says: "You're pretty tall, can you reach up there and get my wheel for me?"
Pan says: "Gotta get these melons home to my wife."
Pan says: "You know how it is."
Still frustrated as ever, Finn pushes Pan aside and picks up the wagon.
Pan says: "Watch out, Rainy!"
Rainy realizes too late. She avoids the first one, which rolls over the wigwam house, but the others roll over her, injuring her. Rainy groans in pain.
Pan says: "Rainy!"
Finn says: "Whoops."
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "man, I'm real sorry."
Pan says: "Yeah?"
Pan says: "No doy..."
Pan says: "friend."
Finn says: "But..."
Finn says: "I can still help."
Finn says: "I'll fix your house for you."
Pan says: "Just get out of here!"
Pan says: "Leave us alone!"
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "wh..."
Finn says: "I..."
Pan says: "Psycho fink."
Finn walks uphill to a cliff overlooking the valley below. He realizes his plan didn't go as well as he had hoped. He takes off his hat and breaks out in song.
Finn says: "♫ I was wrong."
Finn says: "Was I wrong?"
Finn says: "No."
Finn says: "Yes..."
Finn says: "Yes..."
Finn says: "I was wrong."
Finn says: "How could it be?"
Finn says: "I trusted in my guts, but ended up all nuts."
Finn says: "I was wrong."
Finn says: "How could it be?"
Finn says: "Listened to my brain, but ended up insane."
Finn says: "The melons rolled..."
Finn says: "over that lady."
Finn says: "I went too far."
Finn says: "How could it be?"
Finn says: "How did I go..."
Finn says: "too far?"
As Finn finishes his song, the camera zooms out to reveal a little beneath the cliff. A giant eye opens up, looks up, and blinks. Suddenly something hunches up from the cliff. It's the Cyclops Finn has been seeking.
Forest Cyclops says: "Hey!"
Forest Cyclops says: "I know you're here for my magical tears, but you won't have any, because I never cry."
Finn says: "I don't want 'em anymore."
Forest Cyclops says: "What?"
Forest Cyclops says: "Stop lying."
Forest Cyclops says: "You're here for my tears, aren't you?"
Finn says: "No."
Finn says: "I hurt a small, hairy man's wife."
Finn says: "I just wanna go home."
Forest Cyclops says: "You're just trying to make me feel sad so you can steal my tears when I cry..."
Forest Cyclops says: "but I've got a heart of stone, buddy."
Forest Cyclops says: "I'm EVIL!"
Finn says: "Dude!"
Finn says: "What's wrong with you?"
Finn says: "I said I don't want your tears!"
Forest Cyclops says: "YOU'RE LYING!"
Finn says: "I'M NOT LYING!!!"
Forest Cyclops says: "You stink at lying."
Finn says: "Fine."
Finn says: "Whatever, man."
Finn says: "Have it your way."
Forest Cyclops says: "Okay..."
Forest Cyclops says: "I WILL HAVE IT MY WAY!!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Forest Cyclops says: "Beg for mercy, or I'll kill you!"
Finn glances up at the Cyclops' eye. He notices water forming up in the big, round eye.
Forest Cyclops says: "Whuh..."
Forest Cyclops says: "What?"
Forest Cyclops says: "What?"
Forest Cyclops says: "I can't hear you."
Finn says: "I said..."
Finn says: "MY WAY!!"
Finn punches the Cyclops in the eye. The Cyclops starts crying as he screams in pain. Some of the tears fall onto Finn. His clothes are made anew.
Finn says: "Magical tear drops."
Finn says: "My way can still work!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn pulls off the Cyclops' head. Finn first goes to Pan, who is still sobbing. Finn pours the Cyclops' tears over Rainy, who is restored.
Rainy says: "Huh?"
Rainy says: "I'm okay."
Pan says: "Yay!"
Finn runs off. He then goes to the bare bush and pours the Cyclops' tears over him.
Bush says: "Huh?"
Bush says: "Whoa!"
The stump is sobbing in pain from having her sign knocked off. Finn pours the Cyclops' tears over her, and a flower grows where the sign was.
Tree Stump says: "Huh?"
Tree Stump says: "Whoo-hoo."
Finally, Finn pours Cyclops' tears over a ham sandwich at a picnic, bringing it to life.
Ham Sandwich says: "Yeah!"
The scene cuts back to the Tree Fort, where the Clown Nurses are still doing their so-called duties. The big Clown Nurse is still kissing Jake's bandaged foot.
Jake says: "Oh, yeah."
Jake says: "Huh?"
The door suddenly slams open. Everyone gasps in shock. Finn walks in, still carrying the Cyclops' head.
Head Clown Nurse says: "Have you come crying back for your proper treatment, Babylips?"
Finn throws the Cyclops' head. It lands in front of the head Clown Nurse, who gasps.
Finn says: "Kiss that!"
Head Clown Nurse says: "Oh, my!"
Head Clown Nurse says: "You look horribly injured!"
Head Clown Nurse says: "My kisses will make heal you."
Head Clown Nurse says: "Now how does that feel?"
Forest Cyclops says: "Bittersweet."
Finn walks over to Jake, carrying a bottle of Cyclops' tears.
Finn says: "Hey, man."
Finn says: "You want me to heal your toe with my magical goo?"
Jake says: "Ah, no thanks."
Jake says: "I think the kisses work better."
Finn says: "You're gross."
Jake says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "We all have our own ways."
Finn says: "You know what?"
Finn says: "You're..."
Finn says: "right."
Jake's eyes twinkle. The episode ends.
