The episode begins with Finn, Jake, and Princess Bubblegum standing in a field of tree stumps.
Princess Bubblegum says: "And here at this site, my Great Uncle Gumbald cut down all these taffy trees in a single night."
Finn says: "'Cause those trees were evil..."
Finn says: "right, Princess Bubblegum?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Nah."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hey, but I bet they have a ton of stories about your human relatives."
Finn says: "Um..."
Finn says: "not really."
Finn says: "I've never even met any other humans."
Finn says: "If I think about it too much, I get all soul-searchy and weeeeiiirrrd..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Ohhh, boy..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I've made things awkward."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Well, let's forget about that."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I brought you guys here because I need you to rip out all these stumps!"
Finn says: "Okay..."
Finn says: "I guess so..."
Jake says: "Yeah, man, it'll be fun!"
Jake says: "Nyeeeeh, boom!"
Finn says: "SPA-MOW!!"
Jake lands in Finn's arms.
Jake says: "Again, man!"
Finn says: "Huck!"
Jake lands on something; there's a loud clang.
Jake says: "Ow!!"
Jake says: "Whoa..."
Jake says: "I don't think this is a stump."
Finn says: "It's a hatch."
Jake says: "A hatch?"
Jake says: "Waaah!"
Finn says: "Heh-heh."
Finn says: "Whooooooaaaaaa!"
Jake says: "What a dump!"
Jake says: "Can you imagine the jerks that musta lived here?"
A figure emerges behind them.
Finn says: "Huh?!"
Finn says: "!"
The figure stares at them.
Finn says: "AAAAH!!"
Jake says: "AAAAH!!"
Figure says: "AAAAH!!"
Finn says: "AAAAH!!"
Jake says: "AAAAH!!"
Figure says: "Wee meeb youp nuh hur!"
Finn and Jake run while panting heavily. Many more of these figures emerge, surrounding the duo. Finn's flashlight works again; the creatures retreat. The first figure from earlier runs into Finn's light; she stops and stares at them like a deer in headlights. She looks at her shadow.
Figure says: "SHAHOW!!"
Finn says: "These people are so terrified..."
Finn says: "Scared of their own shadows..."
Jake says: "We could rule them..."
Jake says: "like gods!"
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "Angry gods..."
Finn says: "Hey, wait!"
Jake stops Finn and shushes him.
Jake says: "Shh."
Jake says: "They're startled."
Jake says: "Ya gotta be gentle with wild animals."
Finn says: "I don't think they're animals, Jake."
Finn says: "I think..."
Finn says: "this could be..."
Finn says: "a tribe of..."
Finn says: "humans!!"
Finn says: "What are these guys doing down here in this crummy hole?"
Jake says: "I don't know, man."
Jake says: "Maybe they just don't know any other thing."
Finn says: "Suuuun."
Finn says: "Suuuun."
Susan says: "Suhhhn..."
Susan says: "Ow la koo sow suhn."
Finn says: "You poor things..."
Finn says: "Living down here has made you all weird, hasn't it?"
Susan says: "Suuhh..."
Susan says: "suhhhn..."
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Susan?"
Finn says: "Pleased to meet you!"
Jake says: "Well, let's bring 'er up!"
Jake turns into a couch; Finn sits on him.
Finn says: "C'mon."
Jake stretches himself, Finn, and Susan out of the cave. Finn opens the hatch and leaps out.
Finn says: "Aw, man, you're gonna love it up here, Susan!"
Susan says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "There's all sorts of wonders top-side!"
Susan leaps onto the grass.
Susan says: "Aah!"
Susan says: "AAH!!"
Finn says: "Susan, it's just grass."
Susan pants heavily and jumps on Jake's back.
Jake says: "Ooooh!"
Jake says: "Mah back!!"
Finn says: "See?"
Susan says: "Graaaahhhss..."
Jake says: "Oop."
Jake says: "Ya killed 'er."
Finn says: "Wha?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "I did?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Yep."
Jake says: "Felled by surface-world germs."
Jake says: "Heh."
Jake says: "Just kiddin'."
Susan laughs as the plays in the grass. Finn and Jake stare. Susan rises with grass stains all over her.
Susan says: "Hahahahahahahaha!"
Susan says: "Two be cah reh ss..."
Susan says: "buh a thuh ahp fer ger..."
Susan says: "ss."
Finn says: "Aw, Susan..."
Finn says: "You got grass blood all over your face."
Susan says: "YEEH!!"
Susan says: "ITSA PA TUH MUP!"
Finn says: "Susan..."
Finn says: "a hankie won't hurt you."
Finn says: "How'm I supposed to show 'er the wonders of Ooo if every little thing freaks her out?"
Jake says: "Patience..."
Finn says: "Very well."
Finn says: "Then I shall introduce Susan to Ooo..."
Finn says: "by degrees!"
A logo that says "INCREMENTAL TIME" pops up. A ruler goes through the word "TIME.".
The three are now walking through the Cotton Candy Forest. Susan gasps and stops as she spots a beetle.
Susan says: "Manee mah nuhp lehp!"
Finn says: "That can't hurt you!"
Finn says: "That's a dancing bug!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Hahaha!"
Scene transition; the three are now on the cliffs above Red Rock Pass. Susan gasps at a rock.
Jake says: "That's just a rock."
Jake says: "A low-level enemy."
Scene shifts to a forest where the three are having a campfire. Finn opens a package of marshmallows as Jake plays his viola. A beaver rises in the bushes behind Susan. Susan recoils in fear and breathes heavily.
Finn says: "What's wrong?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "See?"
The beaver takes three more marshmallows and runs off. Finn and Susan laugh.
Finn decides to sing, too. He sings Susan a song about how glad he is that she's with him and Jake on the surface world. He hands Susan a stick with a marshmallow on it.
Finn says: "Hey, Jake, how's your marshmallow, man?"
Jake says: "Golden as a wheaty sunset!"
Jake says: "How's yours?"
Finn says: "How's yours, Susan?"
Susan chews on the stick itself.
Jake says: "Heh."
Jake says: "That's adorable."
Jake says: "Hup!"
Jake throws a marshmallow into Susan's mouth.
Susan says: "MMMM!!"
Susan says: "Ohhh..."
Susan says: "Tha is goo!!"
Jake says: "Dang..."
Jake says: "She is way into candy."
Finn says: "Hey, yeah!"
Finn says: "Susan!"
Finn says: "We should take you to the Candy Kingdom!"
Finn says: "Everything is candy there!"
Jake says: "You know, she may be too excited about candy."
Finn says: "Nah..."
Susan says: "CAAANDY KING-DOOOM!"
Scene transition to Candy Kingdom at Princess Bubblegum's castle.
Princess Bubblegum says: "I've enjoyed your visit immensely, Susan Strong."
They signal each other goodbye.
Susan says: "Finn!"
Finn says: "Yeah, Suze?"
Finn says: "Oh, well, it's..."
Finn says: "everywhere!"
Finn says: "The buildings, the lamp posts, even the people!"
Peppermint Butler says: "We're all candy here!"
Finn says: "Susan!"
Finn says: "It's okay."
Finn says: "You're learnin'."
Finn says: "Here."
Susan says: "Mmm!"
Susan says: "Now, I gonna get friends."
Susan says: "We eat all of Candy Kingdom."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Susan says: "Oh."
Susan says: "No, no, no, no, no."
Susan says: "We won't eat red stripe man."
Susan says: "Only everyone else."
Susan says: "Bye!"
Finn says: "Susan, no!!"
Finn says: "Oh, boy..."
Jake says: "So now what?"
Jake says: "Fight the humans to the death when they attack?"
Finn says: "No, man!"
Finn says: "They're my peeps!"
Finn says: "We have to save the Candy Kingdom without hurting them."
Cut to Candy Castle.
Princess Bubblegum says: "They're gonna what?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Finn says: "Don't worry!"
Finn says: "We have a plan!"
Finn says: "We just have to scare the humans away!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Very well."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I shall gather my citizens in the courtyard..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "and you shall see how terrifying the Candy People can be!"
Jake says: "They're doomed."
Back at the hatch, Susan busts out and blows a horn. The rest come out of the hatch. They get scared as they touch the ground.
Susan says: "Just grass!"
Celina says: "Jus grah..."
Scene shifts to the Candy Armory.
Jake says: "Ahh, these candy weapons are too cute to be scary."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Good news, Finn!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I've managed to make my people horrifying!"
Finn says: "But how?!"
Finn says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I've disguised them as gruesome creatures, like witches, and ghouls!"
Starchie says: "Starchie's a beelzebub!"
Jake says: "Aw, so cute!"
Jake says: "I just wanna give them candy!"
Finn looks worried. He hears the hunting horn.
Finn says: "Quick!"
Finn says: "Show me your scary face!!"
Gumdrop Lass 1 says: "Oh, uh..."
Gumdrop Lass 1 says: "Rawr."
Jake says: "I don't think that'll scare anybody..."
Finn says: "NO DUH!"
Finn says: "She's..."
Finn says: "um..."
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "She's..."
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Princess."
Finn says: "I need a little wagon and your biggest roll of wax paper."
The tribe arrives.
Finn says: "Now, Princess Bubblegum!"
Finn says: "It's working..."
Susan says: "Wah!!"
Susan says: "Just shadows!"
Finn says: "Aw, man!"
Finn says: "They've learned how to learn!"
Finn says: "Hide yourselves, Candy People!"
Finn says: "I'll try to make Susan see reason!"
Jake blows on the fire to keep it lit.
Marshmallow Kid 1 says: "The Marshmallow Kids never run from a scrap!"
Finn says: "Please, fellow humans!"
Finn says: "The Candy People are no threat to you!"
Marshmallow Kids says: "CHARGE!!!"
The Marshmallow Kids charge out of the flames to attack the tribe.
Finn says: "WAIT!!"
Finn says: "STOP!!"
Susan says: "DUCK!!"
She ducks; the Marshmallow Kids ignite the other tribesmen's animal hoods. They scream in terror.
Finn says: "MY PEOPLE!!"
Finn says: "Susan..."
Finn says: "what are you??"
Beat; Susan runs off; the fire behind Finn dies down. Finn turns around.
Finn says: "Is everyone okay?"
Finn says: "Marshmallow Kids?"
Marshmallow Kid says: "We'll just be gooey for a while."
They give their burnt skins to Finn and run off giggling. Finn stares forward in the direction that Susan ran off.
Jake says: "Hey, buddy!"
Jake says: "We did it!"
Jake says: "Finn?"
Jake says: "You okay?"
Finn says: "Jake, do you think she was human, or just another wild animal?"
Jake says: "We're all wild animals, brother."
Finn eats some burnt Marshmallow Kid skin.
Finn says: "Yeah..."
Finn says: "I guess we are..."
Finn says: "brother."
The episode ends.
