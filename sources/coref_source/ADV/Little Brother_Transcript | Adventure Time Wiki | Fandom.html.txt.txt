Shelby says: "What?"
Shelby says: "Hey, I got moves, too, guys."
Scorpion says: "Yeah, right, Shelby."
Scorpion says: "What are you gonna do?"

Shelby says: "Haha!"
Shelby says: "Um..."
Shelby says: "who are you?"
Kent says: "Pbht!"
Shelby says: "Oh."
Shelby says: "There's-There's a note."
Shelby says: ""Hey, dude, the tip of your tail got snipped off, so now you have a little brother."
Shelby says: "We named him Butty Butterson."
Shelby says: "Signed, the other bugs."
Shelby says: ""  I'll call you Kent for short."
Shelby says: "Jake.."
Shelby says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "Hmm?"
Jake says: "Whoa, Shelby!"
Jake says: "What's going on there?"
Jake says: "With your butt?"
Shelby says: "It's fine."
Shelby says: "I was goofing off, got hurt."
Shelby says: "Now I got a little brother."
Shelby says: "I named him Kent."
Kent says: "I'm Kent!"
Shelby says: "Whoa!"
Shelby says: "A talking brother."
Jake says: "You can chop up a worm and get two?"
Jake says: "I thought that was a myth."
Shelby says: "Myth is a powerful force in my life, dude."
Shelby says: "So the thing is, I don't know beans about being a big brother."
Shelby says: "Can you give me some tips?"
Jake says: "Ah, it's easy."
Jake says: "You just give him something sharp and get him to fight bad guys."
Shelby says: "That's it?"
Jake says: "Yeah, you might have to stretch all big if he gets in real trouble."
Jake says: "But, yeah."
Shelby says: "Alright."
Shelby says: "Sounds good."
Kent says: "Someday, you'll be Kent's food."
Shelby says: "Hey, how'd you do that?"
Kent says: "I don't know."
Shelby says: "Hmm."
Shelby says: "Okay, Kent."
Shelby says: "This is real important."
Shelby says: "You're my little brother, so your purpose is to fight bad guys."
Shelby says: "So go fight some bad guys."
Shelby says: "Or girls."
Shelby says: "Don't discriminate."
Kent says: "Oh."
Kent says: "Okay, brother."
Kent says: "Boo-oop."
Kent says: "Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop!"
Kent says: "Hyah!"
Dewdrop says: "Hi."
Kent says: "Who are you?"
Kent says: "Where am I?"
Kent says: "Why do my parts hurt?"
Leaf Beard says: "Oh, good, you're awake."
Leaf Beard says: "I am Leaf Beard."
Leaf Beard says: "I found you blonked out and bruised in the tunnels."
Leaf Beard says: "But if you drink of our dewdrops, it will fix up all your ouchies."
Kent says: "Pbht!"
Leaf Beard says: "The rat king has made his way to our end of the roots."
Leaf Beard says: "You should be more careful."
Kent says: "Oh."
Kent says: "Oh, okay."
Kent says: "What's a rat king?"
Leaf Beard says: "Oh."
Leaf Beard says: "You're not from the roots."
Kent says: "I'm from my brother's butt."
Kent says: "Maybe."
Leaf Beard says: "The rat king's been destroying our home, chewing up the roots of this tree."
Leaf Beard says: "This tree that gives us life!"
Guy says: "Hey!"
Kent says: "So, he's a bad guy?"
Leaf Beard says: "So sick, nasty bad."
Kent says: "That means I got to fight him."
Kent says: "That's what my brother said to do!"
Kent says: "Where's my sword?"
Leaf Beard says: "Your sword was shattered to butts when I found you."
Kent says: "Oh..."
Kent says: "bummer."
Leaf Beard says: "Yes."
Leaf Beard says: "Bums."
Kent says: "What do I do?"
Leaf Beard says: "Um..."
Leaf Beard says: "I don't know."
Leaf Beard says: "But the blacksmith could make you a new one, probably."
Dewdrop says: "That's who I am."
Dewdrop says: "And I am very good at me."
Dewdrop says: "Okay, so, like, the rat king has been messing up the roots, yeah?"
Dewdrop says: "Chewing on them with his teeth."
Dewdrop says: "The sword has to be made with the strongest tree stuff so even his teeth can't break it!"
Dewdrop says: "Bring me the freshest ingredients and I'll do it up."
Kent says: "Boo!"
Kent says: "Cool, cool."
Mouse Wizard says: "Greetings."
Kent says: "Hey, man."
Kent says: "I'm looking for some unbreakable ore."
Kent says: "Y'all got that here?"
Mouse Wizard says: "I have what you seek."
Mouse Wizard says: "But consider this instead."
Mouse Wizard says: "I offer you this treasure of glittering emeralds."
Mouse Wizard says: "You'll be infinitely rich and live the rest of your days in comfort."
Kent says: "No, I'm good."
Kent says: "Just the ore, please."
Mouse Wizard says: "Oh, ho!"
Mouse Wizard says: "Well done!"
Mouse Wizard says: "By resisting the temptation of wealth, you have passed my test."
Kent says: "Nah, I just don't care about money."
Kent says: "My name's Kent."
Kent says: "I'm supposed to fight bad guys."
Mouse Wizard says: "Alright."
Mouse Wizard says: "That's pretty weird, but..."
Mouse Wizard says: "here you go."
Mouse Wizard says: "Oh, there, there she goes."
Kent says: "Ha, ha!"
Kent says: "Whoop, whoop!"
Mouse Knight says: "Greetings."
Mouse Knight says: "Come to fight me, eh?"

Kent says: "But for now, I'm looking for a clod of mystic earth."
Mouse Knight says: "Yes."
Mouse Knight says: "I have what you seek."
Mouse Knight says: "But consider this instead."
Mouse Knight says: "I offer you the hand of one of my beautiful daughters."
Mouse Knight says: "You'll become a good husband and live the rest of your days in true love."
Kent says: "Nah, I don't care about being a good husband or wife or whatever."
Kent says: "All's I care about is fighting bad guys."
Mouse Knight says: "Dang, homes."
Mouse Knight says: "That's cold."
Mouse Knight says: "Here you go."
Mouse Knight says: "Mystic earth."
Mouse Thief says: "Greetings."
Kent says: "Dude, you know why I'm here!"
Mouse Thief says: "Yeah."
Mouse Thief says: "And I got what you want."
Mouse Thief says: "But consider this instead."
Mouse Thief says: "Hiya!"
Mouse Thief says: "Drink this sap, and you'll have life eternal."
Mouse Thief says: "You'll never meet death and you'll outlast the world."
Kent says: "Um..."
Kent says: "I was born earlier today, so I don't really get a sense of my own mortality."
Kent says: "No, thank you."
Mouse Thief says: "Hyah!"
Mouse Thief says: "The sacred flame."
Dewdrop says: "Oh, what?"
Kent says: "Whoa!"

Kent says: "I'm gonna fight you with it."
Kent says: "Yes!"
Rat King says: "Who are you fighting me for?"
Rat King says: "Your brother?"
Kent says: "What?"
Rat King says: "Instead, why don't you join me?"
Rat King says: "I offer you cosmic power."
Rat King says: "You'll be a king and live the rest of your days as a god."
Kent says: "You're messing up the tree, and I totally live here!"
Kent says: "You're a bad guy!"
Rat King says: "How do you plan to defeat me?"
Shelby says: "Having a brother around looks kind of fun."
Kent says: "You were the first friend I ever had."
