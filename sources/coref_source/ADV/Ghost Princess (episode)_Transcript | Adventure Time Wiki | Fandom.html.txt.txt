The episode starts in the woods with Finn and Jake by a campfire. Finn is roasting hot dog meat.
Finn says: "Just about done."
Jake says: "Mm, oh boy."
Finn says: "How much Softy Cheesy for ya deezy?"
Finn says: "A little?"
Finn says: "A lot?"
Jake says: "Blech!"
Jake says: "None!"
Finn says: "But you used to love Softy Cheese!"
Jake says: "I don't wanna talk about it."
Camera becomes someone's point of view. The person is viewing Finn and Jake; the person rushes towards Finn. Finn feels a gust of wind and hears a noise. He spits out his food.
Finn says: "What was that?"
Jake says: "Probably an owl."
Jake says: "A ghost!!"
Ghost Princess is seen floating towards them.
Finn says: "Dude."
Finn says: "It's just Ghost Princess."
Finn says: "Hey, GP."
Finn says: "How's it goin'?"
She flies around and howls some more.
Jake says: "Are you haunting us?"
Ghost Princess says: "Yeeeeessss..."
Jake says: "Oh, okay."
She resumes howling.
Finn says: "Well, could ya knock it off??"
Ghost Princess says: "Sorry..."
Ghost Princess says: "It's just..."
Ghost Princess says: "I'm doomed to haunt this mortal plane..."
Jake says: "Oh."
Jake says: "Well, let's hear more about that, honey."
Ghost Princess says: "Until I discover the cause of my death, my soul can't ascend to the 50th Dead World."
Ghost Princess says: "But as a ghost, I have no memory of my mortal life..."
Ghost Princess says: "and no idea how I died..."
Finn says: "It's a crime case!"
Jake says: "Whoa, step back, nephew."
Jake says: "We don't know she was moidered!"
Finn says: "That's right."
Finn says: "We don't even know how she was moida'd, but I'm the hard-boiled sleuth who's gonna crack your case wiiiide open!"
Ghost Princess says: "OH!"
Ghost Princess says: "That sounds wonderful!"
Scene transitions to Ghost Princess's home cemetery.
Ghost Princess says: "This way, gentlemen!"
The three enter.
Jake says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "Your neighborhood is..."
Jake says: "uh..."
Jake says: "very peaceful."
Ghost Princess says: "It's the cradle of my despair..."
Jake says: "Right, right."
Ghost Princess says: "Well..."
Ghost Princess says: "here's me."
Finn slides off Jake and goes to a grave.
Finn says: "Our first clue!"
Finn says: ""Female."
Finn says: "" It's a good start, but we need more."
Finn says: "Jake, it's time to interrogate the neighbors."
Finn says: "We'll do it good cop bad cop style."
Finn says: "I CALL BAD COP!"
Jake says: "Awww..."
Finn walks over to a grave.
Finn says: "Yo, ghost!"
Finn says: "Yo, yo!"
Finn says: "Yo, wake up, fool!"
Finn says: "Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo."
Ghost comes out of grave.

Ghost Princess says: "He's right..."
Ghost Princess says: "!"
Boilbee says: "And don't think I don't see what you do, Ghost Princess."
Ghost Princess says: "What..."
Ghost Princess says: "?"
Boilbee says: "Sneakin' off at night, scarin' peeps, hauntin' at all hours..."
Boilbee says: "'cause you can't deal with your issues!"
Ghost Princess gasps and cries again. Boilbee chuckles. A cheese puff is thrown at him.
Clarence says: "Leave her be, Boilbee."
Boilbee says: "Whaaat?"
Clarence says: "A princess deserves empathy, not your sass."
Ghost Princess gapes in awe.
Boilbee says: "Nyeee..."
Boilbee says: "nyeee..."
Boilbee says: "Butt out, Clarence!"
Clarence says: "Some of us still want to feel, you know?"
Clarence says: "The vital..."
Clarence says: "The vibrating energies that connect all living and..."
Clarence says: "nonliving beings."
Boilbee says: "Nyaaargh!"
Boilbee says: "I don't like your words!"
Boilbee says: "Arrrgh..."
Ghost Princess says: "I'm Ghost Princess."
Ghost Princess says: "Have we met before?"
Ghost Princess says: "I feel like we have."
Clarence says: "I don't think so, m'lady, but I am honor√®d."
Finn says: "Whadda you know about Ghosty-pees gettin' murdle-lurdled?"
Clarence says: "Sorry, I don't know anything."
Clarence says: "I can't imagine anyone who would harm someone as beautiful as this."
Jake says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "Smooth."
Clarence says: "Did you try looking yonder?"
Clarence says: "That's where the ne'er-do-well ghosts hang out."
Finn says: "Right..."
Finn says: "Ne'er-do-wellers."
Finn says: "Let's do this, Jake."
Jake says: "You stay, and eat cheese puffs!"
The two ghosts throw cheese puffs into each other's mouths and laugh. Scene cuts to the ne'er-do-well ghosts' graveyard.

Jake says: "What?"
Finn says: "I'm gonna turn this game..."
Finn says: "UP-SIDE-DOWN!!!"
Scene cuts to the location of the Spirit Waves show. Ghost Princess and Clarence are there.
Ghost Princess says: "So, you really don't know how you died either?"
Clarence says: "Of course not."
Clarence says: "And we might never find out, but that's okay because right now, in this moment, I'm feeling pretty sweetles, you know?"
Ghost Princess says: "I feel..."

Muscular Ghost 3 says: "..."
Muscular Ghost 3 says: "A'ight, Clarence, but only because of that one time when I did that thing by accident and you were cool about it."
Muscular Ghost 1 says: "It's your lucky day, punks."
Muscular Ghosts sink into the ground.
Jake says: "Phew!"
Jake says: "Thanks, Clarence!"
Finn says: "Yo, I'm sorry we haven't solved the case yet."
Ghost Princess says: "It's alright, Finn..."
Ghost Princess says: "I'm calling off the investigation."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Why?"
Ghost Princess says: "I don't feel tormented anymore now that I'm with Clarence."
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "That's..."
Finn says: "that's cool."
Ghost Princess says: "It's hard to explain, but it's like we already know each other."
Clarence says: "I feel it, too."
Clarence says: "Our spirits must be intwined in the cosmic wheel of time."
Jake says: "Nice!"
Clarence says: "Let's go to my private mausoleum where we can be..."
Clarence says: "private."

Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "You looted?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "That's bad, man!"
Finn says: "You're supposed to be good cop."

Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "All of it?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Yes, Jake."
Finn says: "Huh."
Finn says: "This dagger says, "Rence."
Jake says: "What's that?"
Finn says: "I guess some donkus's real name was..."
Finn says: "ReeeeEEEENCE?!!"
Finn says: "!!"
Flashback begins.
Ghost Princess says: "Have we met before?"
Transition to next memory.
Ghost Princess says: "It's hard to explain, but it's like we already know each other."
Transition to next memory.
Finn says: "Is this your knife, bro?"
Transition to next memory.
Jake says: "This ghost ain't home, man."
Flashback ends.
Jake says: "What is it, dude??"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "We gotta dig up the princess."
Cut back to the cemetery; Finn is digging in Ghost Princess's grave, grunting.
Finn says: "Look!"
Finn says: ""Cla-rence."
Finn says: "" Clarence was some donkus!"
Jake says: "Some donkus skee-bopped Ghost Princess!!"
Cut to the mausoleum; Clarence and Ghost Princess are about to kiss, but Finn and Jake interrupt by busting in.
Jake says: "STOP!"
Finn says: "Clarence is your murdler!"
Finn puts the dagger in the light so they can see; the light rests on Ghost Princess. Suddenly, Ghost Princess gasps and then grunts Nyaaargh! and her eyes light up. A flashback begins. War is about to rage. Warrior Princess puts on her helmet and charges with her army, spear in hand. Clarence charges with his army, sword and shield in his hands.
Clarence says: "Warrior Princess!"
Clarence says: "Give up your kingdom!"
Warrior Princess says: "Never!"
Warrior Princess says: "Not even to you, my love!!"
Clarence says: "My love..."
Flashback ends and Ghost Princess's eyes dim, now knowing her cause of death.
Clarence says: "I..."
Clarence says: "did it?"
Ghost Princess says: "I forgive you, Clarence!"
Ghost Princess says: "Take my hands!"
Ghost Princess says: "Ascend with me to the 50th Dead Wooorld..."
Ghost Princess says: "!"
Clarence attempts to grip her hands but his phase through hers.
Clarence says: "I can't!"
Clarence says: "My soul is stuck!"
Clarence says: "I have to know how I died!"
Clarence says: "Oh, Glob..."
Clarence says: "My life is like a fart."
Jake says: "Whoa, wait a minute."
Jake says: "Say that again!"
Clarence says: "MY LIFE IS LIKE A FART!!!"
Jake says: "I know you, man!"
Jake says: "From the Squeez-E-Mart!"
Clarence says: "Huh?"
Clarence says: "Uh..."
Clarence says: "Squeez-E-Mart?"
Clarence says: "I'm starting to remember!"
Clarence says: "I was a broken man."
Clarence in the flashback is lying on the floor, feeling like a fart after the war. After he slew Warrior Princess. He pulls himself up to Tonya, the cashier.
Clarence says: "More."
Tonya says: "Think you've had enough, man."
Clarence says: "I don't care."
Clarence says: "My life is like a fart."
Jake says: "Huh?"
Tonya says: "HEY!"
Tonya says: "HEY, STOP THAT!"
Jake says: "CITIZEN'S ARREST!"
Jake says: "Hey, be careful, man!!"
Too late. Clarence dies a disgusting death as he explodes in a "cheesy" explosion. Jake, with some Softy Cheese splattered on him, is traumatized by this. Clarence's soul leaves what's left of his body, with Softy Cheese splattered all over the place like blood. Flashback ends and Clarence's eyes dim, finally knowing his own death too.
Finn says: "So that's why you don't like Softy Cheese!"
Ghost Princess says: "Claaareeence!!!"
Clarence says: "Ghost Princess!!!"
They kiss and ascend together, blasting the mausoleum to pieces doing so.
Jake says: "Congratulations, you kids!"
Finn says: "Haha, yeah!"
Ghost Princess says: "Goodbyyye..."
Ghost Princess says: "!"
Ghost Princess says: "Thanks for everything!"
Clarence says: "Thanks for everything!"
Clarence says: "Goodbye!"
They kiss and explode into fireworks. Camera pans down to the ground and shows Finn and Jake at their campfire from the beginning of the episode.
Finn says: "You sure you're ready for this, man?"
Jake says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "Gimme one a' them cheesy dogs, man."
Finn does so. Jake takes a bite and swallows with visible difficulty.
Finn says: "All gone?"
Finn says: "Lemme see."
Finn says: "Move your tongue left..."
Jake says: "Wah-vah."
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "And right."
Jake says: "Vah."
Finn says: "I'm proud of you, pal."
Finn says: "Real proud."
Jake lets out a small burp and the episode ends.
