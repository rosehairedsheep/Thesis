Cuber says: "Bable, bable."
Cuber says: "Bable, bable, bable."
Escape pod launches toward planet and three small hostile ships follow it. Cuber's escape pod crashes, creating a large crater. Cuber gets out of it, climbs out of the crater, and moves away from his pod. The three hostile ships arrive and shoot Cuber's escape pod, which promptly explodes.
Cuber says: "Oh!"
Cuber says: "Trust your graybles."

Finn says: "BMO, you got to let me dig this hole."
Finn says: "It's important."
BMO says: "A hole, you say?"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "We beat this evil wizard, see, and we stole his giant wand."
Jake says: "Don't listen to him, BMO."
Jake says: "I beat the wizard, so I'm making Finn dig the hole, even though I could do it in like two seconds."
Jake says: "Heh, heh, heh."
BMO says: "Rude!"
Finn says: "This wand is crazy powerful, right?"
Finn says: "It's a thought cannon."
Finn says: "It makes anything that you think of turn real."
BMO says: "Up, please."
Finn says: "So it's too strong, so we're burying it for safety."
Jake says: "I'll tell you what I'd do."
Jake says: "I'd use that cannon and imagine a hole."
BMO says: "Jake, remember what they say about absolutely power."
Jake says: "I'm tired of your wisdom, BMO!"
Jake says: "Now watch and learn!"
Jake says: "Yeah, okay, my name's Jake, and I'm gonna take this magic thought cannon, and I'm gonna think, I want a hole to bury this thought cannon in, and bobble, bobble, Jake gets a hole in which a thought cannon may be buried!"
Finn says: "What if for a split second you think of something else?"
Jake says: "Nope, my brain's my hands!"
A sub sandwich has appeared in the hole.
Jake says: "Whoops!"
Jake says: "Looks like I was thinking about a sandwich."
Jake says: "Enjoy your labor!"
Jake says: "Heh, heh, heh."
BMO says: "I used to wish I was you."
BMO says: "Now I just wish you would dig faster."
Cuber says: "Could it be the aformabled thought cannon?"
Cuber says: ""Bobble, bobble" as the dead might say."
Cuber says: "That's the power of graybles."
Aliens says: "잠깐, 너 방금전..."
Cuber says: "I guess here goes bable."
A giant sub sandwich appears and launches Cuber out of the hole.
Cuber says: "You try not to think of a sandwich, and look what happens!"
Cuber says: "A sandwich!"

Starchy says: "Yeah, in the ear."
Starchy says: "Oh, I mean, in the rear."
