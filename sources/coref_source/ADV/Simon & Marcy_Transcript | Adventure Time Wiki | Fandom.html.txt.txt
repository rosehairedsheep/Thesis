Ice King says: "Lay down, Marceline, go to sleep!"
Ice King says: "Right?"
Ice King says: "What are we talking about?"
Marceline says: "Alright, I suppose it's about time I told someone this story."
Simon says: "Huh."
Marcy says: "Hmmmmmm..."
Simon says: "Ha-ha!"
Simon says: "Might be something in here, Marceline!"
Marcy says: "E-e-ewww!"
Marcy says: "It's a dead rat!"
Simon says: "Hey!"
Simon says: "Yeah, so it is, looks like we've got a cute new traveling buddy."
Marcy says: "Ewww, noooooooo!!"
Simon says: "Hey, check it out, it's a VHS tape."
Simon says: "You wanna watch a movie?"
Marcy says: "Yeah!"
They both stare at the tape for a while.
Simon says: "..."
Simon says: "Man, this is a boring movie."
Marcy giggles.
Simon says: "I like the book much better!"
Marcy says: "You're so silly, Simon!"
Simon says: "He-he-he, yeah, I suppose so..."
Simon says: "Huh?"
A rustling noise is heard in the bushes..
Marcy says: "What is that?"
Simon says: "I'm not sure, but it's coming our way."
Simon says: "Come on."
Simon says: "Marcy, you stay in the car."
Simon says: "I'll be right back."
Marcy says: "Simon!"
Simon says: "Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
Marcy says: "You're not going to put it on, are you?"
Simon says: "I have to."
Simon says: "To protect us."
Marcy says: "But you're gonna act weird again!"
Simon says: "Don't worry, I can control it better now."
Marcy says: "Mmm..."
Simon says: "It's okay!"
Simon says: "B."
Simon says: "R."
Simon says: "B."
Marcy says: "Simon, stop!"
Marcy says: "It's frozen!"
Simon says: "Not now, Gunther, I'm doing big people things."
Simon says: "Come play in the snow, build me a snowman."
Marcy says: "Bleh!"
Simon says: "Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-- Huh?"
Marcy says: "Simon!"
Marcy says: "Simon, are you okay?!"
Marcy says: "!"
Simon says: "Uh..."
Simon says: "uh..."
Simon says: "yeah."
Marcy says: "You're getting worse, Simon."
Marcy says: "Your hair and your nose are longer, and you started to hover in the air!"
Simon says: "Oh, yeah."
Simon says: "Did I look pretty..."
Simon says: "FLY?!"
Simon says: "!"
Marcy says: "What are you talking about?"
Marcy says: "You're scaring me."
Simon says: "I'm sorry."
Simon says: "Did I say something?"
Marcy says: "Simon, promise me you won't put it on again."
Simon says: "OK."
Simon says: "I promise."
Marcy says: "What is that thing?"
Simon says: "It's a deer."
Simon and Marcy walk over to the frozen deer. The looks around and breathes heavily two times.
Marcy says: "If there are deers in the forest, do you think there are other things?"
Marcy makes a clicking sound and pretends to hit the remote's ON button on the soda can.
Simon says: "♪ Making your way in the world today, takes everything you got."
Simon says: "♪ Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot."
Simon says: "Sometimes you want to go, where everybody knows your name!"
Marcy says: "What is this?"
Simon says: "Filmed before a live studio audience."
Simon says: "Norm!"
Marcy says: "Mute."
Simon moves his mouth without talking.
Morning.
Marcy coughs which wakes up Simon.
Marcy says: "Hey!"
Marcy says: "Good morning!"
Marcy says: "I made you breakfast!"
Marcy says: "It's mostly pine needles and deer guts."
Simon says: "Okay."
Simon says: "You ready for a motorbike ride?"
Marcy says: "Mmm-hmm."
Motorbike sounds.
Simon says: "Okay, now we're talking."
Marcy says: "AAH!"
Simon says: "WOWZERS!"
Simon says: "Okay, let's try something else."
Marcy is seen riding a computer chair while Simon's pushing it.
Simon says: "Hey, Marcy, I wrote a song for you."
Marcy says: "Your songs are sooo good."
Simon says: "Here we go!"
Simon says: "Vandalism is wrong, Marcy."
Marcy says: "Okay."
Simon says: "Oh, everything's gone..."
Simon says: "except for these greeting cards."
Simon says: "Aw..."
Marcy says: "Simon, look!"
Simon looks at the security mirror; there is something at the other aisle.
Simon says: "What is that thing?"
Simon says: "This-This is bad."
Marcy says: "No."
Simon says: "I have to protect us."
Marcy says: "No!"
The mutant hears this then it goes toward Simon and Marcy.
Simon says: "I have to."
Marcy says: "No, don't put it on!"
Simon says: "Marcy, stay back!"
Simon/Marcy says: "Aah!"
Simon says: "We're getting out of here!"
Scene switches. Simon and Marcy are walking through a large concrete storm-drain.
Marcy says: "Oops."
Simon says: "Hey, little lady, what about a ride on an old man's back?"
Marcy says: "I can walk."
Marcy says: "I'm not a child, Simon."
Simon says: "Look, sweetie, someday you'll be too big to hold."
Simon says: "I'm as old as garlic balls, and if someone offered to pick me up and carry me, I'd do it in a heartbeat."
Simon says: "Take it when you can get it."
Simon says: "Gross."
Simon says: "You're gross."
Marcy says: "You're gross, Simon."
Simon says: "We're both gross, darling."
Marcy says: "What are we gonna do, Simon?"
Simon says: "We're gonna run!"
Marcy says: "Whoa!"
Simon says: "Come on, come on, come on!!"
They fall down but the bag is stuck to the tree. They still run while being chased by mutants, then a mutant came close to them.
Simon says: "Mama, mama, mama, mama, mama mia!"
They run to a dark alley, then they are at a dead end.
Marcy says: "Our butts are grass, right?"
Simon puts Marcy in the car.
Simon says: "Not yet."
Marcy says: "Don't leave me here Simon!"
Marcy says: "I can fight!"
Pats bicep.
Simon says: "I'm sorry Marcy."
Marcy says: "Simon!"
Simon closes the car door.
Simon says: "You have to keep it together Simon..."
Simon says: "for her."
Marcy says: "Simon you promised."
Blasts mutants with snow across the alleyway.
SURE WOULD HELP A LOT!!
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE TO GET AWAY!
Where everybody knows your name. Where everybody... ♪.
Simon smacks the crown off his head, and sees a can of chicken soup and a pocketknife fall from the pink substance. He runs to it to take it, but then notices it has a face, but he quickly runs back to the car to give Marceline the soup.
Simon says: "Marcy!"
Simon says: "Look I-I found chicken soup!"
Simon says: "Your gonna feel awesome in a moment."
Marcy says: "I'm just glad  you're ok."
Simon says: "Do you feel awesome?"
Marcy says: "I love you, Simon."
Simon says: "I love you..."
Simon says: "Gunther."
Ice King says: "Whoa, so what happens next?"
Ice King says: "How does it end?"
Marceline says: "Well, little Marcy felt a lot better."
Marceline says: "And she and Simon lived happily ever after."
Ice King says: "Aww, that's nice."
Ice King says: "Marceline, you keep telling these chump stories while I score a bunch of baskets."
Marceline says: "Okay."
Ice King says: "Yeah, yeah!"
