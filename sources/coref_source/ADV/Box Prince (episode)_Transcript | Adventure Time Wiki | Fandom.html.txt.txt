The episode begins with Finn looking out of the Tree Fort's window.
Finn says: "Aw, yes."
Finn says: "Storm has passed!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Jake..."
Jake says: "Nachos?"
Finn says: "Nachos?"
Finn says: "I love nachos..."
Finn continues looking out of the window, while the wind blows. A tire, branch, and a box are blown around.
Finn says: "Hmmm, does that box have a face on it?"
Finn says: "A face..."
Finn says: "I gotta make sure."
Finn runs back to Jake.
Finn says: "There's a box outside with a face on it!"
Finn says: "It might be the boxman, it's all soggy and dirty."
Finn says: "Want to check it out?"
Jake says: "Naaaaa..."
Jake says: "chos."
Finn says: "I'm gonna check it out."
Jake says: "Yeah, whatever."
Finn is exiting the Tree Fort, running towards the box.
Finn says: "Hmmm, where'd your face go?"
The box moves.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Okay..."
Finn says: "shhh..."
Finn says: "are you lost, little cardboard dude?"
A cat reveals its head from the top of the box, mews, and returns back inside.
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "There seems to be a lost cat on the ground in a box!"
Jake says: "Yeah that's great, get it out of here!"
Finn says: "Hm, gettin' no help from him I guess."
Finn says: "Do you know where your home is?"
The box shakes, mews, and starts walking away.
Finn says: "Okay, I'll follow you!"
The scene changes to Finn and the box treading through the forest.
Finn says: "Whoa, is this your kingdom?"
Finn says: "It's wonderful!"
The box kingdom is shown. It is inhabited by many cats wearing boxes. The Box Prince is being carried by other Box Kingdom citizens.
Finn says: "That must be your prince."
Finn says: "Huh?"
The Box Prince is shown stealing a fish from a net.
Finn says: "Huh..."
Finn says: "a prince wouldn't steal from his subjects."
Finn says: "Awww!"
Finn says: "Switched?"
Finn says: "Of course!"
Finn says: "You must be the real prince, and that thief took your place!"
Finn says: "Is that right, little prince?"
The scene returns to Jake, who is still playing Pro Football 1861 on BMO.
BMO says: "Why do you hate cats, Jake?"
Jake says: "Move your face, you're messing up the game."
Jake says: "Anyway, I don't wanna talk about it, it's personal."
Jake says: "Cats know what they did..."
Jake suddenly starts wailing in pain.
BMO says: "Is Jake okay?"
Jake says: "Eugh..."
Jake says: "no!"
Jake says: "I'm pretty dang far from okay!"
Jake says: "There's a little shard of Tortilla chip caught between my teeth."
The scene returns to the Box Kingdom, where the prince is still waving to his people. Finn is with the true Box Prince, spying with a pair of binoculars.
Finn says: "First, we have to expose the traitor's deception."
Finn says: "Ah-hah!"
Finn says: "That's a counterfeit crown, from the liar's own box flesh."
Finn says: "Hmm..."
Finn says: "it looks like your crown was torn off by some..."
Box Prince says: "Mew."
Finn says: "Your crown was lost, you say?"
Finn says: "During a storm?"
Finn says: "The same storm that sent you hurling through the woods?"
Finn says: "Until you were delivered into my door step?"
Finn says: "Right..."
Finn says: "so it's definitely in the woods somewhere."
Finn says: "All we have to do is find your crown to prove to your people that you're the real prince."
The Box Prince starts scratching the sand.
Finn says: "Um..."
Finn says: "I'm gonna wait over by the gate, your highness."
Scene returns to Jake, who is still playing Pro Football 1861.
BMO says: "Get big, and the chip will fall out of your teeth!"
Jake says: "You think I can stretch out of everything?"
Jake says: "You're so na√Øve."
Jake says: "To live life, you need problems."
BMO says: "That's stupid!"
Jake says: "If you get everything you want the minute you want it, then what's the point of livin'?"
BMO has flashbacks of the various moments where Jake used his special powers to ease out of situations.
Finn says: "Okay, so let's retrace your steps."
Finn says: "Do you remember which path you took?"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Prince?"
The Box Prince finds his crown, and is trying to get it out of a tree branch.
Finn says: "Whoa, you found it already!"
Finn says: "Good work, team."
Finn says: "Ow, quit that!"
Finn says: "Come, your majesty."
Finn says: "It's time..."
A citizen is seen reading a book. Finn takes off its box, which causes it to run away.
Finn says: "J'accuse!"
All of the citizens walk away, seemingly disappointed.
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "They..."
Finn says: "they don't believe us."
Finn says: "The rain made your complexion look all hobo-like."
Finn says: "They're not looking past the surface grunk."
Suddenly, the false Box Prince is seen, having a cardboard "lance" attached to his box.
Finn says: "Oh no, he's challenging you to a joust!"
Finn says: "I better find you a lance."
The scene switches to BMO and Jake in the bathroom, Jake is brushing his teeth.
BMO says: "Did it come out?"
Jake says: "You forgot the most important part, my impatient little friend."
Jake says: "A thorough rinsing!"
BMO says: "Well?"
Jake says: "I need, like, a toothpick, or something."
BMO says: "I told you to buy floss."
Jake says: "Floss is for losers."
Jake says: "Oh, one of these will do nicely."
BMO says: "You'll put cards in your mouth?!"
BMO says: "!"
Jake says: "Just the edge, kid, then I'll work it like a pro."
Jake says: "Now, to find the card that best suits my devil-may-care personality."
Two Box Kingdom citizen blow horns in an arena.
Finn says: "Trial by combat shall prove which prince's true!"
The Joust begins. Both of the princes start charging and hit each other, resulting in their boxes coming off. They are both revealing to have the exact same fur coat. Suddenly, the audience also starts fighting each other.
Finn says: "The joust's gone nuts!"
Scene changes to BMO sitting on the floor, humming to himself.
Jake says: "Hey, BMO!"
Jake says: "Ta-da!"
BMO says: "You did it, Jake!"
BMO says: "Congratulations!"
BMO says: "How did you get the piece of tortilla chip out of your teeth?"
Jake says: "Oh, I didn't."
Jake says: "It's still there."
Jake says: "It'll be like a constant reminder of what life's all about."
BMO says: "..."
BMO says: "This is unsatisfying!"
Jake says: "ZIP IT!"
The scene is back to the Box Kingdom, still in chaos. Finn takes out a window cleaner from a box.
Finn says: "Bad!"
Finn says: "Bad princes!"
All of the cats suddenly stop fighting.
Finn says: "Which is which..."
Finn says: "?"
Finn says: "Awwww!"
Finn says: "This is the one!"
Finn says: "This is your prince!"
Finn says: "Or maybe this is the one!"
All of the cats walk away.
Finn says: "Hmmm, is this..."
Finn says: "is this even a kingdom?"
Various cats surround Finn, displaying affection.
Finn says: "Haha!"
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Ow, you guys..."
Finn says: "aw, come on!"
Finn is completely swarmed by purring cats.
Episode ends.
