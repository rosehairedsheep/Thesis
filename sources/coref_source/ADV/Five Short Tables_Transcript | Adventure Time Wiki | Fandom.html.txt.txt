Cake says: "No!"
Fionna says: "Wha?!"
Fionna says: "!"

Cake says: "Now try starting with the dockworker having a moral crisis."
Fionna says: "Okay."
Fionna says: "This..."
Fionna says: "one?"
Cake says: "Fionna, this character doesn't serve any thematic purpose until much later in the meal."
Fionna says: "Sorry, Cake, but these just look like formless blobs of sweet flapjack to me."
Cake says: "Mmm..."
Cake says: "It's true."
Cake says: "Maybe if I based them off real people, do some "life cooking" -- nonfiction flapjacks!"
Cake says: "Let's go griddle up portraits of the entire kingdom!"
Cake says: "Got to get my supplies together."

Ice King says: "On to the next chapter -- "A Game of Gumball."
Fionna says: "Prince Gumball would probs make a great flapjack model."
Fionna says: "Sometimes he gets so absorbed in his work that he doesn't move for days."

Prince Gumball says: "Butterscotch Butler, the butterscotch Scottish butler, I challenge you!"
Butterscotch Butler says: "Again?"

Prince Gumball says: "!"
Butterscotch Butler says: "Huh?"
Butterscotch Butler says: "Oh."
Butterscotch Butler says: "You leave that lying around everywhere."
Cake says: "Yes!"
Cake says: "Still not quite right."
Fionna says: "How about this for some inspiration?"
Cake says: "Pancakes and flapjacks are nothing alike!"
Fionna says: "Aw, Cake."
Cake says: "It's just that flapjack literature is such a niche genre, and none of my flapjacks are turning out any good."
Fionna says: "Come on, Cake."
Fionna says: "We've still got 10 minutes before the library closes."

Turtle Prince says: "I'm sorry."
Turtle Prince says: "I have a duty to serve the library's patrons, but I'm also sworn to protect the books."
Turtle Prince says: "I can't in good conscience let you take it home."
Turtle Prince says: "But maybe I could read this book to you?"
Flame Prince says: "Listen, I just came in here to use the bathroom, man."
Flame Prince says: "I thought you had to, like, check out a book first to pee."
Flame Prince says: "Actually, I don't even have a library card."
