Finn, clad in mourner's tuxedo, is walking through the candy castle.
Finn says: "Jake..."
Finn says: "?"
Finn says: "Jake?"
Finn says: "Hey, man."
Jake says: "Hey, dude."
Finn says: "You still thinking about..."
Jake says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Yeah?"
Finn says: "Me, too."
Finn says: "Princess Bubblegum's ready for us, so we should go."
Jake says: "Okay."
Jake says: "Just give me a few more months in here and I'll be ready."
Finn says: "It's okay, man."
Finn says: "Just—"
Finn says: "just play it off."
Finn says: "Just make a—"
Finn says: "a normal face."
Finn says: "See?"
Finn says: "Normal face."
They walk out onto the balcony with Princess Bubblegum and two Banana Guards flanking... something covered in a sheet.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming."
Princess Bubblegum says: "We may begin the ceremony!"
A three-legged robotic transport vehicle makes its way through the Desert of Wonder. Finn and Jake look out the window while Princess Bubblegum works the control panel.
Finn says: "Thanks for bringing us along on the trip, Preebs."
Jake says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "It's unfortunate we can't enjoy some of these cool things we're passing by, but I guess we could do that the next time we're in the Desert of Wonders, whenever that is!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "We're on a mission to collect samples only."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I want to start colonizing this area by the end of the year."
Jake says: "You are killing me, PB!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "James, give a readout on fuel."
James says: "Right away, Princess."
James says: "Boop!"
James says: "Boop!"
James says: "Boop!"
James says: "Boop!"
James says: "Beet!"
James says: "We have a surplus of fuel, so after we collect samples, we may explore."
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "I'm glad James is on this trip."
Jake says: "Hey, James, thumbs up, buddy!"
Finn says: "Heh."
Finn says: "Dude, James is kind of, uh, goofy."
Jake says: "I wasn't gonna say anything, but yeah."
Jake says: "Maybe when we get to know him better, it'll be charming."
Princess Bubblegum says: "James, slow down."
Princess Bubblegum says: "We're here."
James says: "I'm registering mondo mega rads down there."
James says: "I'll ready the radiation suits upon landing."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Excellent."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Take us down."
James says: "Hold on to your sack lunch!"
Finn and Jake strap in as the robot vehicle jumps into a large pit. It turns on its thrusters and lands softly. Finn, Jake, Princess Bubblegum, and James, clad in radiation suits, exit the vehicle.
James says: "Vrrt!"
James says: "Vrrt!"
James says: "Vrrt!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Okay."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You guys collect as many surface samples as you can—"
Princess Bubblegum says: "rocks, plants, dirt, anything."
Jake says: "Mostly looks like it's just dirt here."
James says: "This'll be fun."
James says: "Jake, open up the basket."
James says: "I'm gonna make a shot!"
Jake says: "Do it!"
James says: "Chk-chk!"
James says: "Whoop!"
Jake says: "Ha ha!"
James says: "Wah-wah!"
The stick burns and the green substance bubbles. It turns out to be the mouth of a goo monster, which growls as it pokes its head out of the ground.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Aah!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Ach!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Brownstadt!"
Several other monsters emerge from the soil.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Guys, run!"
The others scream, and they all run into the vehicle. James is running slowly.
Princess Bubblegum says: "James, speed up that sack lunch!"
James says: "Vrrt!"
James says: "Vrrt!"
James says: "Vrrt!"
James says: "Vrrt!"
James says: "Vrrt!"
James says: "Vrrt!"
James says: "Vrrt!"
James says: "Vrrt!"
James says: "Vrrt!"
James says: "Vrrt!"
The monsters approach the vehicle while groaning.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Ugh!"
The vehicle tries to take off, but the monsters knock it off balance, tipping it over. Finn, Jake, Princess Bubblegum, and James are thrown to one side of the vehicle. The monsters break the legs off the vehicle.
Finn says: "Ugh!"
Finn says: "Everyone okay?"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Oh, my garf!"
Finn says: "What are they?!"
Finn says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Uh, they're toxic creatures from another time."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Okay, let's see—"
Princess Bubblegum says: "suspension's all donked, navigation's lost, and the ship's legs are kaput."
Princess Bubblegum says: "We're dead in the water."
James says: "Chk!"
James says: "Ah-oogah!"
A monster vomits on the window. The glass sizzles as the acidic substance eats through.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, yuck!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Come on!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Manners!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Gotta brain out the situation."
[A digital clock displays 6 says: "45 and counting."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Those goo monsters will barf their way through the hull in mere minutes."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn, what should we do?"
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "let's radio for help."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Good idea, but looks like the radio's kerplowed."
Jake says: "Mnh."
Jake says: "Mnh."
Jake says: "James, that's not helping!"
Finn says: "Don't panic, baby."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yes."
Princess Bubblegum says: "James is very resourceful."
Princess Bubblegum says: "He'll work it out."
James says: "Look, Princess!"
James says: "I invented a coin-operated coin screwdrive-e-er!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "See what I mean?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Good job, James."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Come on, guys."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Let's take inventory of the emergency gear."
James says: "Lucky coin strikes again!"
Outside, monsters continue taking apart the ship.
Finn says: "Hey, Preebos, I know things seem bad, but I'll figure out a plan."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I know, Finn."
Jake says: "Dude, I found us some flares!"
Jake says: "I saved us!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Right on!"
James says: "Hey, dudes, the radio is fixed!"
Jake says: "Good Grod!"
Jake says: "I love you, James!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I knew you could do it, James!"
Jake says: "You know, James, I wasn't sure about you at first, but you're okay."
James says: "Thanks, Jake."
James says: "I wasn't sure about you either."
Princess Bubblegum says: "James, the radio's still not working!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm not getting any signal."
Finn says: "What the skunk?!"
Finn says: "!"
Electricity crackles from the cut wires.
Finn says: "James, it's all sanched up!"
James says: "James is like, "Wha?!"
James says: "!"
James says: "" It was working just a second ago, I swears!"
James says: "I went, like, "Choo-choo-choo!"
James says: "" and the radio was like, "Pch-choo-whichoo-whichoo-whichoo-whichoo," and then I was like..."
Jake says: "This guy's totally cuckoo!"
Jake says: "This is my cuckoo face."
Princess Bubblegum says: "He did his best, you guys."
Finn says: "Right, right."
Finn says: "Okay, time for plan B."
Finn says: "James, pass me them flares."
James says: "Chk-oo!"
James says: "Boop!"
James says: "A flare for m'liege."
Finn says: "James, where are the flares?!"
Finn says: "!"
James says: "What?!"
James says: "!"
James says: "May—"
James says: "maybe they're, uh, invisible flares."
Jake says: "Finn, PB, can I speak to you in the other room, please?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "You want to do this trust-huddle style, buddy?"
Jake says: "Hm."
The three form a huddle.
Princess Bubblegum says: "So what's all the hubbub?"
Jake says: "What's up with that James dude?"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Do you think James could be breaking things on purpose?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "No."
Princess Bubblegum says: "James wouldn't do that."
Jake says: "Wake up."
Jake says: "Dude's a saboteur."
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's not James."
James says: "What's not James?"
James says: "I got lonely up front."
James says: "I wanted to see what y'all are up to."
Finn says: "Hey, that gives me an idea."
James says: "Me, too!"
James says: "Vrrt!"
James says: "Just kidding!"
James says: "I don't have any ideas."
Princess Bubblegum and James run to control panel.
James says: "Diversion."
James says: "D-d-d-d-d-d-diversion!"
James says: "Time to set up a diversion."
The button mashing extends a solar panel, flashes a light, and extends a robotic arm from the front of the ship. The monsters all move to that end. Finn and Jake look through the back window.
Jake says: "You see anything, brudda?"
Finn says: "More goo bros."
A flare explodes behind the monsters.
Finn says: "What the—"
Finn says: "?!"
Finn says: "!"
The monsters run from the flare toward the vehicle and start breaking the glass. Finn and Jake run back to the control room. Jake grabs a large object from the wall and throws it toward the monsters.
Princess Bubblegum says: "That won't hold them for long."
Jake says: "It can't end like this."
Jake says: "I got a lady and five kids!"
Jake says: "I thought I'd outlive at least one of them!"
James says: "Here, man."
James says: "Take this."
Jake says: "Your lucky coin?"
James says: "Yeah, man."
James says: "It always keeps me calm."
Finn says: "Who shot that flare, James?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "We don't have time to point fingers."
Finn says: "You're right."
Finn says: "There's only one way out of this jam."
Finn says: "One of us has to eat the big one so the others can survive."
Princess Bubblegum nods.
Finn says: "And I'm gonna be that one."
Finn says: "I'll run up there and get the creatures to chase me, and while they're busy noshing on my teen-boy body, you three can climb to safety."
Finn says: "Don't try to talk me out of it."
Finn says: "I got crystal certainty."
Finn says: "This is what it means to be a he—"
Princess Bubblegum hits his head with a wrench, knocking him out.
Jake says: "Wha—"
Jake says: "?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "James."
Princess Bubblegum says: "We need to talk."
[From Finn's POV says: "Finn opens his eyes, just barely, and hears Princess Bubblegum talking to James."
Princess Bubblegum says: "So, what do you say?"
James says: "Sure thing, Princess!"
James says: "Byong!"
Finn closes his eyes, falling into unconsciousness. He reopens them outside. Princess Bubblegum is carrying him and Jake.
Finn says: "Ugh!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Why did—"
Finn says: "Jake?"
Finn says: "Wh—"
Finn says: "where's James?"
James is running from the group of monsters, but they overtake him and jump on him.
Finn says: "James!"
Princess Bubblegum climbs out of the pit and looks back at the ship. The screen fades out. She is now in a grassy place, bandaging Finn's head.
Finn says: "Aah!"
Finn says: "James, look out!"
Finn says: "Ohh."
Finn says: "PB!"
Finn says: "What's going on?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn, I need to explain something really heavy."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I was the one who sabotaged all your escape plans."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I calculated the chance of success for every possible escape plan, and none of them were going to work."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You said it yourself: there was only one way out."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Someone was going to have to eat the big one to save the others."
Princess Bubblegum says: "James did something really noble to save us."
Finn says: "But I wanted to do it."
Finn says: "Why didn't you let me?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "There's a reason."
Princess Bubblegum says: "With this sample of James, I can clone a new one."
Princess Bubblegum says: "He's candy, but you're not."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I can't clone another you."
Finn says: "Whoa."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I made the best choice available."
Flashback ends.
Princess Bubblegum says: "James served the Candy Kingdom on a dangerous mission, and even though he is gone and it's super sad, I would like to honor James..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "with this new James I whipped up in the lab!"
Banana guards unveil the new James.
James' Clone says: "Jeet!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Here you go, James—"
Finn says: "Is this right or wrong?"
Finn says: "I can't tell."
James' Clone says: "Hey, cool."
James' Clone says: "Did I do something cool?"
James' Clone says: "Do I do something cool?"
Jake says: "I don't know, man."
Jake says: "Here's your coin, James."
James' Clone says: "Wow!"
James' Clone says: "This day keeps getting better and better!"
Jake says: "Ehh."
The scene cuts to the edge of the pit. A zombified James climbs out, followed by a large group of monsters.
Episode ends.
