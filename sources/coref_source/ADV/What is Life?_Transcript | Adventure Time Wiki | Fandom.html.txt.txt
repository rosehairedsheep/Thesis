The episode begins with Finn playing video games on BMO. Jake enters with a bag of butter.
Jake says: "Hey, man."
Finn says: "What's so funny?"
Jake says: "Oh, you know, just takin' this garbage bag of butter..."
Finn says: "Dude."
Finn says: "That's not that funny."
Finn says: "EAAH!!"
Jake says: "HAHAHAHAHA!"
Finn says: "Ohhh, butter pranked!"
Finn says: "I can't believe I didn't see that coming!"
Jake says: "Heh, yeah, I'm a genius."
Finn says: "You have offended my honor, sir, and in so doing, you have awoken the pranking demon that sleeps in my pits!"
Finn says: "The demon is coming for you, mortal."
Finn says: "It is going to prank you..."
Finn says: "so..."
Finn says: "HARD!"
Jake says: "Whatever."
Jake says: "I'm gonna take a day long nap."
Finn says: "That's right, suckah!"
Finn says: "Go nap it up, for when you awake, the pranking demon will be upon you!"
The scene shifts to the cave of the fort, where Finn is building something and singing the Never Ending Pie Song.
Finn says: "It's never-ending pie-throwing time!"
Finn says: "C'mon, dude!"
Finn says: "Turn on!"
Neptr says: "Ouch!"
Finn says: "Holy stuff!"
Finn says: "It talked!"
Finn says: "Wow-cow-chow!"
Neptr says: "Greeting, creator!"
Finn says: "Oh, whoa!"
Finn says: "Hey, man!"
Neptr says: "My name is Neptr, which stands for "Never-Ending Pie-Throwing Robot."
Finn says: "Oh, perfect!"
Finn says: "You're exactly the kind of robot I was trying to make!"
Neptr says: "Creator, I am eager to commence the creation and propulsion of pies forever, but my pie-hucking appendage is..."
Neptr says: "malfunctioning, and my oven lamp is cold, and my tank treads do not roll!"
Neptr says: "They only do skids!"
Neptr says: "Why, creator?!"
Neptr says: "!"
Neptr says: "Does it please you to watch me struggle?!"
Neptr says: "!"
Finn says: "Neptr!"
Finn says: "Don't say stuff like that!"
Finn says: "Look, I know we just met, and you're probably goin' through a lot of personal stuff right now, but I really like you, Neptr, and I'm not gonna rest until you're working properly and throwing hot pie on my best friend's face."
Finn says: "Together, we're gonna prank the poots out of Jake!"
Neptr says: "Haha!"
Neptr says: "I'll always love you, creator!"
Finn says: "I know you will, Neptr."
Finn says: "Now, all we need is more lightning power so you can be operating at full capacity!"
Finn says: "And I think I know just the dumb-hole who we can get some from."
Scene transition—Neptr and Finn are floating in the Ice Kingdom via balloons.
Neptr says: "Ooh, what beautiful piles of sugar!"
Finn says: "Heh."
Finn says: "No, Neptr."
Finn says: "We call that snow."
Neptr says: "Snoooow??"
Finn says: "UNH!"
Finn says: "Did y'all smack me into that mountain on purpose?"
Balloons says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Take note, Neptr."
Finn says: "These guys are grade-A pranksters."
Finn says: "You guys hang out in case we need a daring escape!"
Balloons all talk at once "Yeah! Sure! Daring escape, yeah! Absolutely! We got your back!" and Finn and Neptr enter the lair.
One Balloon says: "I got his wallet."
Finn says: "Just gotta sneak around until we find his lightning bolt stash."
Neptr says: "But, creator, is not breaking and entering wrong?"
Finn says: "No, we're pranking and entering, which is awesome!"
Neptr says: "Sneaking!"
Neptr says: "We're sneaking..."
Finn says: "Shush, Neptr!"
Neptr says: "Sneaking..."
Finn says: "Shh!"
Neptr says: "Sneaking..."
Finn says: "Neptr, you're gonna get us caught!"
Neptr says: "Sneaking!"
Ice King says: "Is that you, honey?"
Ice King says: "You see, Gunter, that's how it would go if I actually had a wife."
Penguin says: "Wenk."
Ice King says: "Game time!"
Ice King says: "Stupid lady."
Ice King says: "Kill it..."
Neptr says: "Creator, if we get caught, I want you to know that I will always love you."
Finn says: "Shh!"
Finn says: "You already told me that!"
Finn says: "And we're not getting caught!"
Finn says: "We're gonna get you working so you can prank Jake!"
Finn says: "He could wake up from his nap at any second!"
Back at the Tree Fort.
Jake says: "I might wake up at any moment!"
Jake says: "Naaaah, I'm still asleep."
Back at the Ice Kingdom.
Ice King says: "No, no!"
Ice King says: "That frog is casting magic missiles on my babe!"
Finn says: "Quickly!"
Finn says: "While he's distracted!"
Finn stealthily moves away.
Ice King says: "No, c'mon, get out of the—"
Ice King says: "UGH!"
Ice King says: "Move!"
Penguin says: "Wenk!"
Ice King says: "Baaaugh!"
Ice King says: "LOOK WHAT YOU DID, GUNTER!!"
Finn slides behind an ice pillar.
Finn says: "We're home free, Neptr."
Penguin says: "Wenk wenk wenk wenk wenk wenk wenk!"
Ice King says: "What are you on about?"
Ice King says: "You're starting to infuriate me..."
Ice King says: "It's almost like you're trying to alert me—"
Ice King says: "warn me about..."
Ice King says: "I don't know, an intruder or something?"
Ice King says: "Perhaps he's lurking in this very room, just outside my field of vision!"
Penguin says: "Wenk wenk wenk wenk."
Ice King says: "Well, knock it off!!"
Neptr says: "What'll we do, creator?"
Finn says: "We're gonna prank 'im, Neptr."
Finn says: "Hardcore."
Ice King says: "Ooh!"
Ice King says: "Oh, blast these melty ceilings!"
Finn says: "Hee hee hee hee!"
Neptr says: "Creator, you have shown me the joys of pranking!"
Neptr says: "I cannot wait to throw pies infinitely at Jake's face!"
Finn begins to slide off the spike.
Finn says: "The ceiling really is melty!"
Ice King says: "What was that?"
Finn says: "WAAAAH!"
Finn and Neptr take a screaming ride down the lair.
Ice Toads says: "Alarm!"
Ice Toads says: "Alarm!"
Ice Toads says: "Alarm!"
Ice Bull comes down.
Finn says: "Figs!"
Ice King says: "Huh?"
Ice King says: "An intruder!"
Ice King says: "Maybe a beautiful princess like in my poems."
Finn says: "We've gotta find that lightning as fast as—"
Neptr says: "Creator!"
Neptr says: "Lightning!"
Finn says: "It's a lightning-shaped door!"
Finn says: "And we're gonna smash right into it!"
Finn says: "Hold on, Neptr!"
Finn says: "I got a plan!"
Finn slides up the wall and the Ice Bull crashes into the door, shattering itself and knocking the door down.
Neptr says: "That was a great plan!"
Finn says: "Nah, that wasn't my plan."
Finn says: "We got lucky!"
Neptr says: "Are those my tickets to the gun show, creator?"
Finn says: "Mm-hmm."
Finn says: "You're gonna be fully functional just like I promised."
Ice King enters with his ice-o-pede.
Ice King says: "Whoa, ice-o-pede!"
Ice King says: "Finn?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Ice King says: "Oh, why can't you ever be a princess?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Ice King says: "Ice-o-pede, attack!"
Ice King says: "Ice-o-pede, no!"
Ice King says: "Aaah!"
Finn says: "Let's grab some lightning and get outta here!"
Ice King destroys the machine holding the lightning.
Ice King says: "Hahaha!"
Ice King says: "Finish him off, my semi-loyal pet!"
Ice King says: "An innocent bystander?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Ice King says: "ZAP!"
Finn says: "Neptr!"
Finn says: "NOOOOO!"
Finn says: "NOOOOOO!"
Finn says: "—"
Finn says: "Oh, yeah."
Finn says: "That's what we wanted to happen."
Neptr says: "Neptr is fully functional!"
Neptr says: "Yay!"
Finn says: "Neptr!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
The ice-o-pede picks Finn up.
Ice King says: "Crush him!"
Ice King says: "Crush him like you crushed me!!"
Neptr says: "Creator?"
Finn says: "Neptr!"
Finn says: "The pies!"
Finn says: "Pies!"
Neptr says: "Oh, right!"
He throws three pies at the ice-o-pede. It roars and falls down.
Ice King says: "Come on!"
Finn says: "What was in those pies?!"
Finn says: "!"
Neptr says: "Just boysenberry."
Neptr says: "Hahaha."
Neptr says: "And also..."
Neptr says: "poison."
Finn says: "Neptr's acting..."
Finn says: "different."
Balloons says: "Quick, Finn!"
Balloons says: "Jump!"
Finn attempts to grab onto the balloons, but they make him miss and fall. Two balloons catch him before he hits the ground. The balloons laugh.
Finn says: "Heh heh."
Finn says: "You guys got me."
Ice King says: "Something about that robot I tried to kill fills me with..."
Ice King says: "deep longing."
Scene shifts to the Tree Fort.
Finn says: "Thanks, guys."
Finn says: "Your blood-oath is fulfilled."
Balloons says: "Yay!"
Balloons says: "To the mesosphere!"
One Balloon says: "Finally we can die!"
Neptr says: "I am troubled, creator."
Neptr says: "Troubled by a sudden urge to..."
Neptr says: "collect princesses."
Finn says: "Neptr, that's a heavy unsettling thing to say, but pull yourself together."
Finn says: "We're about to prank Jake!"
Neptr says: "Uh-huh."
Neptr says: "Sure."
Finn says: "One..."
Finn says: "two..."
Ice King says: "THREE!"
Finn says: "Run, Neptr!!"
Neptr says: "Oooh!"
Finn says: "Aw, man."
Ice King says: "I've come to take my son."
Finn says: "Your son?!"
Finn says: "!"
Ice King says: "Come to Papi, son."
Ice King says: "I won't attack you..."
Ice King says: "unless provoked."
Finn says: "He's not your son!"
Finn says: "If anything, he's my son!"
Ice King says: "It was my power that activated his full potential."
Ice King says: "Zzz."
Neptr says: "Oooh..."
Ice King says: "When you were struck by my lightening, you also became infused with my private particles."
Ice King says: "He wants to be with me, Finn!"
Finn says: "No way!"
Finn says: "Neptr wants to help me prank Jake!"
Neptr says: "I am torn!"
Neptr says: "I am processing a love for both princesses and pranking!"
Ice King says: "Don't worry, son."
Ice King says: "I'll show you the life you deserve!"
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "Neptr!"
The three transport to Ice King's Imagination Zone.
Ice King says: "Yes!"
Ice King says: "Now that we've entered my imagination zone, allow me to tantalize you with this!"
Ice King says: "Princesses!"
Ice King says: "As my son, you will carry on the tradition of capturing ladies!"
Neptr says: "Tell me more, Papi!"
Finn says: "No, Neptr!"
Ice King says: "I want a son who can do better than I."
Ice King says: "One who can succeed where I..."
Ice King says: "have failed."
Ice King says: "You can mate with robot princesses!"
Neptr says: "Can I still prank with Finn after?"
Ice King says: "NO!!"
Ice King says: "I'll show you what will happen if you hang out with Finn!"
A vision of Finn and Jake farting on Neptr appears.
Imaginary Finn says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Imaginary Finn says: "Pootin' on Neptr to the max!"
Jake says: "Pootin' on Neptr to the max!"
Vision disappears.
Neptr says: "Haha!"
Neptr says: "Yeah, I love Finn's pranks!"
Ice King says: "NOOOOO!!"
Ice King says: "I'm through playing around, son."
Ice King says: "Who do you choose?"
Finn says: "Come on, Neptr."
Finn says: "Choose me, buddy."
Finn says: "Choose pranks."
Neptr says: "I..."
Neptr says: "uh, I..."
Neptr says: "choose..."
Neptr says: "Ice King!"
Finn says: "WHAT?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "You've gotta be flippin' kidding me!"
Ice King says: "He made his choice!"
Ice King says: "Get over it, crybaby!"
Neptr says: "I'm not finished."
Neptr says: "I choose Ice King..."
Neptr says: "to prank!"
Neptr says: "Hardcore!"
Ice King says: "I birthed you and I can un-birth you!"
Finn says: "NEVER!"
Ice King says: "OOF!"
Neptr says: "Sleep well, Papi."
Neptr says: "In your Imagination Zone full of beautiful princesses."
Finn says: "You wanna prank Jake?"
Neptr says: "It's why I was created."
Finn says: "Haha, okay."
Finn says: "Let's gooooo!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Wake up!"
Jake says: "Ahhh, hey, du—"
Jake says: "AAAAAH!"
There are sounds of pies landing on Jake. The camera pans towards a knocked out Ice King; a tear drops down his cheek. Scene shifts to Ice King's imagination.
Imaginary Neptr says: "Sun is going down."
Imaginary Neptr says: "Shall we capture princesses now, Papi?"
Ice King says: "No, let's just stay here a little longer, son."
Imaginary Neptr says: "I love you forever, Papi."
Ice King brings Neptr closer, and the episode ends.
