Finn says: "Wha—"
Finn says: "?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Jake, I told you to stop staring at me right at the time when I wake up."
Jake says: "I'm staring because I can't move my head."
Jake says: "No, really, I can't move."
Finn says: "I can't move either."
Jake says: "What's happening?!"
Jake says: "!"
A door is heard closing off screen.
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "What was that?"
Finn says: "Who goes there?"
Jake says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "Who is that?"
Finn says: "Jake, use your peripheral vision!"
Jake says: "Ice King!"
Ice King says: "Ah, this is weird."
Finn says: "What did you do to us, Ice King?"
Ice King says: "Whoa, whoa."
Ice King says: "I didn't "do" anything to you, okay?"
Ice King says: "C'mon, guys, I'm your friend."
Jake says: "So why can't we move?"
Ice King says: "Ooh, because I froze you..."
Ice King says: "with this."
Finn says: "Freezing Potion A."
Ice King says: "I sprayed it on you while you slept."
Gunter says: "Wenk!"
Gunter says: "Wenk!"
Ice King says: "No!"
Ice King says: "Gunter, no!"
Ice King says: "This one likes to break bottles, don't ya?"
Ice King says: "Tuck-ety tuck!"
Ice King says: "Let's move to the living room."
Scene changes to the living room. Ice King is vocalizing while carrying Finn and Jake. He places their stiff bodies in a chair.
Jake says: "Why are you doing this, Ice King?"
Ice King says: "Why?"
Ice King says: "Oh, because I love you guys."
Ice King says: "But you don't love me, do ya?"
Jake says: "You tried to kill us, like, four times."
Ice King says: "I only try to kill you 'cause you're princess-blocking me all the time!"
Ice King says: "Anyway, now that you're frozen, we can bond and stuff."
Ice King says: "And the sooner we do, the sooner I can spray you with this."
Finn says: "Unfreezing Potion A?"
Ice King says: "Ah, I underlined the "un" so I wouldn't mix 'em up."
Jake says: "Just unfreeze us now, man."
Finn says: "Yeah, 'cause we're already friends."
Ice King says: "We are?"
Jake says: "Mm-hmm."
Ice King says: "What's my favorite color?"
Finn says: "Uh, yellow?"
Finn says: "Orange?"
Finn says: "Blue—"
Finn says: "no, no, lavender!"
Finn says: "Lavender!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Um, ooh, uh..."
Jake says: "rainbow?"
Ice King says: "You don't love me."
Ice King says: "I know a lot about you guys."
Ice King says: "Jake, you don't put ice in your drink because you have sensitive teeth."
Jake says: "Wha—"
Jake says: "?"
Ice King says: "And Finn, your favorite food is meatloaf."
Finn says: "How did you—"
Finn says: "?"
Ice King says: "And Jake, sometimes you don't cry because you're afraid of real emotion."
Ice King says: "It's okay."
Ice King says: "Let it out."
Ice King says: "Bad penguin!"
Gunter says: "Wenk!"
Ice King places both bottles on a high shelf and locks the corks with a key.
Finn says: "You lock your bottles?"
Ice King says: "Huh, in this economy?"
Jake says: "Don't touch my lemons, Ice King!"
Jake says: "Ice King!"
Finn says: "Jake, look!"

Finn says: "No!"
Jake says: "No!"
Jake says: "Gunter!"
Jake says: "No!"
Finn and Jake moan in anticipation of the bottles breaking as Gunter continues clinking the bottles.
Finn says: "Gunter, stop!"
Gunter says: "Wenk, wenk!"
Jake says: "What're we gonna do?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "When someone loses one sense, their other senses are enhanced—"
Finn says: "like a blind man who can smell and hear really well."
Finn says: "I'm gonna try using my now-enhanced brain sense to make contact with an Astral Beast who will help us."
Jake says: "What?"

Ice King says: "Huh?"
Ice King says: "Gunter..."
Ice King says: "No, Gunter!"
Ice King says: "No bottles."
Ice King says: "Look at me."
Gunter says: "Wenk!"
Ice King says: "Now, our first bonding activity will be walking in each other's shoes—"
Ice King says: "so to speak."
Ice King says: "To better understand each other's perspectives, we're going to dress up like each other."
Ice King says: "Me first!"
Ice King rips off his sleeves, takes black marker out of bag and draws shoes on his bare feet, ties his robe, fashions his beard to look like Finn's hat, and creates an ice backpack on his back.
Jake says: "Noooo!"
Jake says: "No, no, no, no, no!"
Ice King says: "Okay, okay!"
Ice King says: "We'll bond in another way."

Ice King says: "I take artful black and white photographs of my penguins' body parts."
Ice King says: "Photography is art; let's see some art."
Ice King says: "This is a haunting image of a penguin's flipper."
Ice King says: "Look at how it penetrates the negative space."
Ice King says: "Oh yes, this one is very—"
Jake says: "I can't take this any more!"
Jake says: "Dang it, Finn!"

Ice King says: "A little cheese, a little cider..."
Ice King says: "could be nice, y'know?"
Ice King says: "Maybe bring a veggie plate?"
Ice King says: "I think people would appreciate that."
Gunter is held back by Hand Snow Golem but breaks free and walks over to the key.
Ice King says: "This next one is very rewarding..."
Jake says: "What are you waiting for?"
Jake says: "Just grab it!"
