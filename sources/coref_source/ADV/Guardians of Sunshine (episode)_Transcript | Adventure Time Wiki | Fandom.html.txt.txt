Finn and Jake are playing Guardians of Sunshine on BMO in the main room of the Tree Fort.
Finn says: "Haha!"
Finn says: "Time to protect the sun!"
Jake says: "Ha ha!"
Jake says: "Yeah, he knows how to get things started."
Finn says: "Firepit number 1."
Finn says: "Easy-peasy, livin' greasy!"
Finn says: "You wonder why they even put it there."
Jake says: "It's probably a computel gleetch."
Jake says: "Now comes some real trouble!"
Jake says: "It's Bouncy Bee!"
Jake says: "He's gonna get that sun, man!"
Finn says: "Haha!"
Finn says: "Please."
Finn says: "Bleep!"
Finn says: "I had my eyes closed on that one!"
Jake says: "Yeah, that was cool."
Jake says: "Oh, oh, you missed a coin, dude, go back!"
Finn says: "I ain't in it for the money, man."
Finn says: "I'm in it to crush the enemies of the sun."
Finn says: "Like this sloppy butt right here."
Jake says: "Hunny Bunny!"
Finn says: "I'm like, Hunny Bunny, don't you ever learn?"
Finn says: "I've always got the bomba!"
Jake says: "Man, you are hot tonight!"
Jake says: "Think you can do it this time?"
Jake says: "Can you beat Sleepy Sam?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Oh, I very can!"
Jake says: "Remember: use a combo move!"
Finn says: "Okay!"
Finn says: "Here goes."
Jake says: "Spin, down, up, left, faster, dude!"
Jake says: "Right, left, down!"
Sleepy Sam eats Finn's character. 'You Lose' is displayed on the screen.
Finn says: "Aww!"
Finn says: "Every time!"
Finn says: "BMO, this game is the worst!"
Finn says: "If we were really inside that game, man, we would crush Sleepy Sam."
Finn says: "Breezily!"
Finn says: "With my mitts!"
BMO says: "Oh no!"
BMO says: "It's much more dangerous than you think!"
Finn says: "Whoa, whoa, wait!"
Jake says: "BMO, is there a way for us to get in the game for real?"
BMO says: "Yes, of course, Jake."
Jake interrupts BMO by pressing the button repeatedly, and then stops.
BMO says: "If I push this button, you will both be dangerously transported into my main brain game frame where it is very dangerous!"
Finn says: "Oh, man."
Finn says: "Oh, BMO!"
Finn says: "You gotta let us in that game!"
BMO says: "No!"
BMO says: "It's a far too dangerous incredible adventure for you!"
BMO says: "It's final."
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Okay, BMO."
Finn says: "Well, time for bed!"
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "Finn?"
Finn says: "Time for bed."
Finn says: "Right, Jake?"
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "oh, right!"
Jake says: "Heh heh."
Jake says: "Good night, BMO."
Scene changes into later that night, showing Finn and Jake sneaking back into the main room of their treehouse. Jake slips the blanket off of a sleeping BMO and opens the compartment where the button to transport Finn and Jake is. Finn graps a feather out of his mouth and hands it to Jake. Jake then tickles the button to try to get BMO to slam it. BMO grunts a few times and then slams the red button down, which releases electricity from BMO, transporting Finn and Jake into Guardians of Sunshine. The art style changes into a 3D polygonal look.
Finn says: "We're in the game!"
Jake says: "Look!"
Jake says: "There's the sunshine we gotta protect!"
Finn says: "I'm looking at my bits!"
Finn says: "My leg is math!"
Jake says: "Mmm."
Jake says: "That sunshine feels good."
Jake says: "Feels good all over!"
Finn says: "No wonder all the monsters in this game want to get their grubby mitts on it!"
Finn says: "Let's go kick their digital bootays!"
Finn says: "Doo!"
Finn says: "Doo!"
Finn says: "Doo!"
Finn says: "Doo doo!"
Finn says: "Doo!"
Jake says: "Beep boop!"
Jake says: "Beep boop!"
Finn says: "♫ We are in the computer world."
Finn says: "We're computer boys, not computer girls."
Jake says: "♫ In a game, I can be who I virtually am."
Finn says: "♫ I can walk and sing, I can kill Silly Sam!"
Jake says: "Smells like..."
Finn says: "Pit!"
Finn says: "Looks a mite bigger inside the game..."
Jake says: "Jumpin' over this pit is easy, remember?"
Jake says: "We could do this backwards with our eyes closed!"
Jake says: "Ahh!"
Jake says: "I'm burning!"
Finn says: "Jake!!"
Jake says: "Haha."
Jake says: "What, man?"
Finn says: "Whaa?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Jake, what the shake?"
Jake says: "Check it out!"
Jake says: "Extra lives!"
Finn says: "You still have two left!"
Jake says: "Ow!"
Jake says: "It burns!"
Jake says: "Ow!"
Jake says: "Haha!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Dude!"
Finn says: "What if losing all your lives in here makes you die in real life?"
Finn says: "Or worse?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "that makes me just want to sit here and feel bad."
Finn says: "No way, man!"
Finn says: "We're gonna cross that hole!"
Finn says: "With real-world grit!"
Finn says: "Come on!"
Off-screen, Finn gets on Jake and Jake transforms into a bigger dog form. We see Jake running toward firepit.
Finn says: "Faster, Jake!"
Finn says: "Get ready to stretch it!"
They stop right before the pit starts, and Jake stretches his body out above the pit. After a second, they encounter a flame rising out of the pit.
Finn says: "Watch out, Jake!"
Jake says: "Ow!"
Jake says: "Whew!"
Jake says: "That was pretty intense, dude!"
Finn says: "We're pretty intense dudes!"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Ha!"
Whirring sound starts.
Jake says: "What's that sound?"
Finn says: "Sounds like..."
Finn says: "Bouncy Bee!"
Jake says: "Bouncy Bee!"
Bouncy Bee starts chasing them as they run away.
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Scene changes to a new room where Finn grunts while jumping off hands and Jake is beside him.
Finn says: "Hi-yah!"
Jake flexes.
Both jump as Bouncy Bee flies towards them.
Finn says: "You ready to flippin' this guy up, Jake?"
Jake says: "Easy-peasy, livin' greasy!"
Both knuckle punch as the show's logo explodes on the screen.
Scene goes back to Finn and Jake, where Bouncy Bee is drilling a hole into Finn while Jake looks horrified at the scene. Finn screams as Jake helplessly looks on. The computer makes a sound that means Finn has lost a life. Finn fades away.
Jake says: "No!"
Scene changes to Jake running away from Bouncy Bee in a cave-like surrounding.
Jake says: "Finn's dead!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "No!"
Jake says: "Oh, Finn!"
Finn says: "Yo, what up?"
Jake jumps into Finn's arms.
Jake says: "Oh, Finn!"
Jake says: "You're alive!"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "I got extra lives, man!"
Jake says: "Oh my gosh."
Jake says: "Let's never die again!"
Jake says: "There's nothing more precious than a life!"
Jake says: "Ooh, dude, look."
Jake says: "Coins!"
Jake says: "Oh man, oh man!"
Jake says: "Ooh!"
Jake says: "Oh, man, dude, these coins are thick!"
Jake says: "Let's take 'em back to the real world!"
Jake says: "We'll be filthy stinkin' rich!"
Both Finn and Jake laugh as Jake grabs all three coins. A monster snarls behind them and they turn around to look.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Hunny Bunny!"
Jake says: "Hunny Bunny!"
Hunny Bunny shoots a laser at them, which makes them fall back into a pile of coins they've collected. This makes them lose their coins.
Jake says: "No!"
Finn says: "Time to use the bomba!"
Finn says: "Oh, bomba!"
Finn says: "I can't select you without my controller!"
Hunny Bunny growls at Finn.
Jake says: "Let's get outta here, Finn!"
Finn says: "Man, we've never run away from Hunny Bunny!"
Hunny Bunny shoots laser at them. Scene changes to Finn and Jake walking slowly away in a cave-like surrounding.
Finn says: "Firepit, Bouncy Bee, Hunny Bunny."
Finn says: "They're supposed to be the easy parts!"
Finn says: "They're all hard as butts!"
Finn says: "Sleepy Sam is gonna be the ultimate butt-kicker!"
Jake says: "Look, Finn."
Jake says: "The most important thing to remember is that I still have one giant coin."
Finn says: "Man, get a hold of your brains!"
Finn says: "We need to stay alert for Sleepy Sam!"
Jake says: "Hey, that's him right there!"
Finn says: "Get down!"
Finn says: "I'm gonna break you, Sam."
Finn says: "When I'm done, they'll call you..."
Finn says: "uh, Stinky Sam."
Finn says: "Stupid Frog."
Camera pans over to Sleepy Sam, who sticks his tongue out. Finn gets up and starts tip-toeing over to Sleepy Sam while raising a fist over himself. The camera looks at Sam for a second. Suddenly, Sam turns around and screams at the viewer, shooting out a spiral of green stuff. Finn screams and is thrown back by the green stuff. He lands by Jake.
Finn says: "M-m-my mitts didn't- didn't work!"
Finn says: "Come on, help me punch him!"
Jake says: "Okay!"
Jake pushes Finn to Sleepy Sam, but Sleepy Sam engulfs Finn before they can do any damage. The computer jingles to signify Finn losing a life. The computer jingles again to signify him returning. Sleepy Sam screams at Jake, which throws him back into Finn's arms.
Jake says: "Let's get outta here, man!"
Jake says: "We're gonna die!"
Sleepy Sam starts hopping towards Finn and Jake as they run away. They screech to a stop as they confront Hunny Bunny, who shoots lasers at them. They dodge, and keep running. They run all the way back to the firepit, which they jump over. Hunny Bunny and Sleepy Sam jump over as well. Hunny Bunny and Sleepy Sam land on Bouncy Bee, and Finn and Jake land on the edge of the other side of the firepit, which they quickly jump over. They run away from the flying Bouncy Bee with Hunny Bunny and Sleepy Sam on its back.
Finn says: "I can see the light!"
Finn says: "We're almost there!"
Finn and Jake run towards the light, but hit an invisible force field, knocking them back on the ground.
Finn says: "Oh no, man."
Finn says: "It's the edge of the screen!"
Finn says: "We're trapped and they'll be here any second."
Jake says: "Wait, dude!"
Jake says: "The bomba!"
Finn says: "We can't get the bomba!"
Jake says: "Wait, dude."
Jake says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "Jake?"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "What if I..."
Jake says: "?"
Finn says: "That's not how it works!"
Jake grabs the bomba, which results in the sound of crackling. The word 'ERROR!!' appears on the screen and flashes in different colors.
Finn says: "Jake, let go of that!"
Jake says: "But we need the bomba!"
Jake grunts as he tries to pull the bomba from the top of the screen. When he pulls it out, green electric current flashes out from where it was. Jake gets knocked back to where Finn is. The electric current revolves around Finn as Finn starts screaming. The electricity pulls him towards the hole.
Jake says: "Finn!"
The electric current moves over to where Jake is and pulls him up too. Jake also starts screaming. It also grabs the coin Jake was carrying.
Scene switches to the tree house's main room. It is morning and BMO wakes up with blue electric current shooting out of him. BMO grunts as Finn and Jake are shot out of him.
Finn says: "Oh, holy cow!"
Finn says: "That was nuts, man!"
Jake says: "Yeah, man."
Jake says: "And I got my coin!"
Jake says: "Oh no!"
Jake says: "Are you alright buddy?"
BMO says: "Did you have to- oh no!"
BMO says: "Wait!"
BMO says: "Run!"
Sleepy Sam starts coming out of the hole in BMO. Finn and Jake start running towards the door. Jake jumps through the window in the door. Finn looks back to see what's happening with BMO for a split second, and then exits through the door. Both of them fall down onto the ground outside. The treehouse starts shaking violently and something bulges out. The tree house breaks open with Sleepy Sam, Hunny Bunny, and Bouncy Bee being thrown out. Hunny Bunny grabs Finn and Jake as they shout. Bouncy Bee starts lowering his stingers.
Finn says: "No, no, no!"
Finn says: "Don't kill us, man!"
Finn says: "No!"
Jake says: "Aw man, don't kill us!"
Jake says: "We don't have extra lives!"
Sleepy Sam says: "Oh wait."
Sleepy Sam says: "Hold up, guys."
Sleepy Sam says: "Check it out!"
Sleepy Sam says: "Sunshine!"
They all look toward the Sun and enjoy the sunshine. Hunny Bunny flops his head, Bouncy Bee starts licking the sunshine, and Sleepy Sam rubs his face.
Sleepy Sam says: "Oh boy, that feels good!"
Hunny Bunny says: "Alright!"
Hunny Bunny says: "See ya later, Sam!"
Finn says: "You mean, that's it?"
Finn says: "You're not gonna kill us?"
Sleepy Sam says: "Of course not."
Sleepy Sam says: "The game's over; we won!"
Sleepy Sam says: "All we wanted was the sunshine."
Sleepy Sam says: "And to kill that computer that's been imprisoning us for so many years."
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "what?"
Scene switches to treehouse, where Hunny Bunny and Bouncy Bee have BMO in their clutches.
BMO says: "Help!"
BMO says: "Oh no!"
Finn says: "BMO!"
Jake says: "BMO!"
Sleepy Sam says: "Oh sure."
Sleepy Sam says: "He's dangerous!"
Sleepy Sam says: "If he hits his button again, back we go."
Finn says: "BMO, quick!"
Finn says: "Hit your button!"
BMO says: "I can't, Finn!"
BMO says: "I'm stuck!"
Sleepy Sam says: "You want him to hit his button?"
Sleepy Sam says: "What's wrong with you?!"
Sleepy Sam says: "!"
Sleepy Sam starts to wrestle Jake and lick him. Jake struggles to keep him away.
Jake says: "We'll save you, BMO!"
Jake says: "Finn, go!"
BMO says: "They're too strong!"
BMO says: "Use the combo move, Finn!"
Finn says: "The combo move?"
Finn says: "That never works!"
Jake says: "Listen!"
Jake says: "You got this, man!"
Finn says: "Up!"
Finn says: "Down!"
Finn says: "Left!"
Finn says: "Left!"
Finn says: "Right!"
Finn says: "Right!"
Finn says: "Down!"
Finn says: "Spin!"
Finn says: "Down!"
Finn says: "Up!"
Finn says: "Left!"
Finn says: "Right!"
Finn says: "Left!"
Finn says: "Down!"
Finn says: "Spin!"
Finn says: "Up!"
Finn says: "Down!"
Finn says: "Jump!!"
Scene switches to show Sleepy Sam disappearing in white light and Jake falling onto ground where Sleepy Sam used to be. Scene switches again to show Hunny Bunny and Bouncy Bee disappearing in the white light, which makes BMO fall. Scene switches again to Finn, who is breathing heavily.
Finn says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "Woohoo!"
Jake says: "You did it, Finn!"
Jake says: "I knew you had the stuff!"
Jake says: "Right, BMO?"
Scene shows BMO upside-down on the ground, with steaming pouring out of him as he groans.
Finn says: "Oh, crud!"
Jake says: "BMO!"
Finn flips BMO over so he is right-side up.
Finn says: "I'm sorry, buddy!"
BMO says: "Finn, I told you about the danger!"
BMO says: "And now look!"
BMO says: "You fricasseed my stuff and broke our house all up!"
Finn says: "I know, I know."
Finn says: "I was double butt."
Finn says: "For real."
Finn says: "Man!"
Finn says: "Now that we know what to expect, next time will be way more fun!"
Jake says: "Yeah, yeah!"
Finn says: "How 'bout it, BMO?"
Finn says: "You in?"
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Don't do the combo move on us!"
Jake says: "We were only joking!"
Finn says: "BMO!"
Finn says: "Stop messing around!"
Screen shows the words 'GAME OVER' in green over a black screen.
