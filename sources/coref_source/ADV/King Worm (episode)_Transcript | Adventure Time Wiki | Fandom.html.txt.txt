Princess Bubblegum says: "My king..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Wake up, husband."
Finn says: "What??"
Finn is revealed to be in the Candy Kingdom throne room and wearing a big crown.
Banana Guards says: "Long live the king!"
Finn says: "What..."
Finn says: "is..."
Finn says: "goin' on?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hm."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Not much."
Banana Guards says: "Long live the king!"
Finn says: "Huh?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "?"
A crowned worm rises on Princess Bubblegum's shoulder.
King Worm says: "Wowowowowowow..."
Finn says: "Hey..."
Finn says: "do I know you?"
Finn says: "Hey..."
Finn says: "I know that guy!"
Princess Bubblegum's face appears in the back of her head.
Princess Bubblegum says: "He doesn't know he's dreaming."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Huh??"
Finn is now sitting in front of Flame Princess.
Flame Princess says: "Come on, honey."
Flame Princess says: "Eat your soup."
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Huh..."
Finn says: "?"
Finn says: "Wait, wait, wait..."
Flame Princess says: "EAT IT NOW!!!"
Finn cautiously does so and smiles.
Dream shift.
Finn says: "Mmm..."
Finn says: "hmm..."
Finn says: "What kind of—"
Finn says: "AAAH!"
Finn says: "How..."
Finn says: "did we get here?"
Finn says: "You!"
Flame Princess is now Peppermint Butler.
Peppermint Butler says: "You haven't much time, sir."
Finn says: "What??"
Peppermint Butler now has a tiny head jutting from his body.
Second peppermint head says: "You are trapped in a dream."
Peppermint Butler says: "And you are in danger."
Peppermint Butler says: "You need to find this worm and break it."
Finn says: "Find the worm?"
Finn says: "But..."
Finn says: "you've got 'im right there!"
The worm is once again the spoon. Phil appears in Peppermint Butler's pants.
Phil says: "Satori!"
Peppermint Butler throws the spoon at Finn, who is now in the library.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Jake?"
Next to him is Lady Rainicorn. She starts blowing tape out her "tape hole.".
Lady Rainicorn says: "Hold down the tape until it fully sticks to the paper."
Jake says: "Like this?"
Lady Rainicorn says: "Yes, but now try holding it higher."
Jake says: "Like this?"
Lady Rainicorn says: "You need more tape."
Lady Rainicorn says: "Now, tape the bottom."
Jake does so.
Jake says: "Who's it for?"
Lady Rainicorn says: "Who's it for?"
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: ".."
Jake says: "It's for..."
Jake says: "um..."
A transparent Finn glides in front of Finn saying, "It's for meeee!".
Lady Rainicorn says: "Play this."
Jake says: "Uh..."
Jake says: "okay."
Jake starts playing terribly. A music note comes out of the viola and becomes the worm.
Finn says: "The worm!"
Finn says: "Worm..."
Finn says: "worm..."
Finn says: "Woyyym!"
Finn says: "Worm!!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "Aw, man, is it really you?"
Finn says: "Yep."
Jake says: "I'm trapped in this dream, and I can't wake up!"
Finn says: "Me, too!"
Finn says: "I was just in some other part of the dream with Princess Bubblegum and Flame Princess."
Jake says: "Make-out dreams?"
Jake says: "Nice..."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "No, it wasn't like that!"
Jake says: "Hey, I won't judge."
Lady gapes at Finn making a deep noise.
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Lady's got two mouths..."
Jake says: "Mm-hmm."
Jake says: "I don't think she's real."
Finn says: "Weird..."
Finn says: "Ouch!"
Finn says: "What was that for?"
Jake says: "Just wanted to make sure you were real."
Jake says: "Our dreams must be linked for some reason."
Finn says: "Whoa..."
Finn says: "Well..."
Finn says: "Pep-but told me we gotta find that worm that crawled through that hole and break it."
Finn says: "I usually dream of messed-up stuff, like a shark tryina' bite off my face."
The blade of the sword turns into a shark. The shark roars like a lion. Finn shrieks, and the air behind him begins to crack.
Jake says: "Careful!"
Jake says: "If you grunk up the dreamscape with your subconscious fears, the whole thing'll blow apart!"
Finn says: "Ohhh."
Jake says: "Just shrink down like me."
The Shark Sword disappears.
Finn says: "And then I shrunk down like Jake."
Finn and Jake enter the mouse hole. Scene shifts to a tunnel underground. As Finn and Jake talk, their voices echo as if they were in metal chambers.
Finn says: "How do you know so much about dreams and stuff?"
Jake says: "'Cuz I sleep a lot."
Finn says: "Heh heh."
Finn says: "Oh, yeah."
Finn and Jake emerge from a hole in the ground, apparently normal size now. Ice King comes up to them after going in the opposite direction over a mountain.
Ice King says: "Fionna, Cake, I need your help!"
Finn says: "What??"
Jake says: "What did you say??"
Ice King says: "I really did it this time!"
Ice King says: "They're loose, and they're coming for us!"
Finn says: "Who?"
Quacks are heard from far away. A monster composed entirely of merged penguins appears.
Finn says: "AAH!"
Jake says: "AAH!"
They both run away. Ice King simply runs in circles.
Dream shift.
Finn says: "Dad??"
Joshua is seen sitting nearby.
Jake says: "Help us!"
He says nothing. Jake and Finn look at each other.
Finn says: "Maybe he's not really..."
Finn says: "real."
Finn and Jake stop in front of him.
Jake says: "Dad, are you okay?"
Joshua wordlessly opens a case and gets yarn and knitting needles out. He starts knitting a scarf.
Finn says: "That scarf looks..."
Finn says: "familiar..."
Jake says: "Yeah..."
The scarf turns into the full sized King Worm. It quickly crawls away.
Finn says: "Man!"
Finn says: "The worm is fast!"
Jake says: "Yeah, it's nuts!"
Jake says: "Fast as nuts."
Finn says: "Well, let's catch it with..."
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "some big ol' legs!"
Jake says: "Well..."
Jake says: "that's kinda boring for me..."
Jake says: "'cuz that's my normal power, you know?"
Finn says: "Then you get..."
Finn says: "birds!"
Jake is now able to fly, with the lower half of his body being a bird. They pursue the worm up a mountain. It starts raining Lumpy Space Princesses. Finn falls.
Finn says: "Ay ay ay ay ay!"
Jake says: "Remember, this is just a dream!"
Jake says: "Keep climbing!"
They go further up the mountain to the snowy part. It's now snowing Lumpy Space Princesses. Finn and Jake find a frozen King Worm.
Finn says: "Now what?"
Jake says: "Break it!"
A rock falls from the sky. Finn and Jake use it to shatter the worm. As they put the rock down, the dream itself melts into nothingness. Finn and Jake are now in bed, awaking with a start. BMO wakes up because of the noise, then goes back to charging its battery.
Finn says: "Jake, are you okay?"
Jake says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "Are you?"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "I'm okay."
Finn says: "We did it!"
Jake says: "We did it!"
Jake says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
Finn says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "I'm pretty sure this is not normal."
Jake says: "Nope, it's fine."
Finn says: "AAH!"
Finn says: "Jake, I think we're still dreaming!"
Jake says: "Nah, it's just dream residue."
Jake says: "Forget about it."
Finn says: "You pinched me earlier, but I never pinched you."
Finn chases Jake. The floor suddenly becomes the wall.
Jake says: "Everything's norrrmaaaal..."
Jake says: "."
Dream shift to the entrance room.
Finn says: "It's still a dream."
Finn says: "Hmmm..."
Finn says: "Huh?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake's remains suddenly turn into a laughing King Worm. Finn gasps.
King Worm says: "Hey, guys..."
Transparent Finn says: "Hey, guys!"
Finn tries to throw the shattered, but now un-shattered cup at the worm, but it simply goes around him and comes back at Finn.
Finn says: "Why're you jankin' up my dreamscape!"
Finn says: "?"
King Worm says: "Listen, don't worry about it."
Finn says: "WHAT?!"
Finn says: "!"
King Worm says: "You can't defeat me..."
King Worm says: "I'm the king worm."
King Worm says: "I'm going to keep you in this dreamscape until I've consumed..."
King Worm says: "all your..."
Smaller King Worm says: "..."
Smaller King Worm says: "Life energy!"
Finn says: "My life energy?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "I use that!"
Finn says: "Aaagh!"
Finn says: "Oh, man..."
Finn says: "I'm gonna be stuck here..."
Finn says: "forever."
The air again cracks. The crack reaches the ceiling and the ceiling begins to crack. A piece of the ceiling falls and hits King Worm on the head.
King Worm says: "Ouch!"
King Worm says: "Hey, guys!"
Transparent Finn says: "Hey, guys!"
King Worm says: "Knock it off!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Pictured Jake says: "Psst."
Pictured Jake says: "If you grunk up the dreamscape with your subconscious fears, the whole thing'll blow apart!"
Finn says: "Hmm?"
Finn says: "Oh, yeah!"
Finn says: "Thanks, dream Jake!"
Finn says: "GET READY TO EAT IT!"
King Worm says: "Wowowowowowowow..."
Finn says: "Okay, Finn..."
Finn says: "Concentrate."
Finn says: "Deepest..."
Finn says: "gut..."
Finn says: "fears!"
The camera pans into Finn's mouth, and fades into black. A baby Finn is seen. "Kitty!" Fear Feaster opens a case. Finn gasps. He's now inside of a green room which resembles King Worm. Water starts pouring out of his belly button.
Finn says: "Oh, gross!"
Finn says: "AAAAH!!"
Finn says: "OH, GLOB!"
Finn says: "THE LICH!!"
King Worm says: "Hey, why don't you sit down, or pass out or something?"
Finn says: "NEVER!!!"
The Lich laughs maniacally, hurling fire balls at Finn. Princess Bubblegum comes out of Finn's belly.
Finn says: "Bubblegum!"
Finn says: "WAAA-HOOO!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn, shush!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm having coffee with the Lich."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You wouldn't understand."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You're too young."
Finn screams in utter terror. King Worm coughs.
Finn says: "SO MUCH SCREAMING!!!"
Finn's bed legs suddenly come out of his belly button. Finn lays in the bed in helpless fright as the Ghost Lady comes towards him. Finn falls out of the bed and lays on the floor panting.
Finn says: "Had enough..."
Finn says: "destabilization?"
King Worm says: "I don't..."
King Worm says: "..."
King Worm says: "know what you're talking about..."
A clown pops out of Finn's belly button.
Clown says: "I'm a clown!"
Finn lets out a small scream.
King Worm says: "Well, that's that."
The dreamscape finally gets destroyed. Finn is now in the entrance room with Jake, in front of King Worm, surrounded by smaller worms. The small worms vanish.
King Worm says: "I don't feel so good."
Finn says: "GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, KING WORM!!!!!!!"
Finn says: "Is it really you..."
Finn says: "this time?"
Jake says: "Yeah, mans."
Jake says: "Actual Jake."
Finn says: "Cool..."
Finn says: "Pinch."
Jake says: "Ow, man, come on!"
Finn says: "I'm just checkin'!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Just checkin'."
The episode ends.
