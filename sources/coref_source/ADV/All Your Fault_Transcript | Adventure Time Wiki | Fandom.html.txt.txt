Princess Bubblegum is in her lab working on a circuit board when a cloaked bird drops a letter on her table and flies away.
Princess Bubblegum says: "What the..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Bull gunk!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I left them a lifetime supply of candy!"
She swivels her chair to the window and looks out at Jake and Cinnamon Bun having a picnic, with Finn watching in the bushes.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hey Finn!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hey Jake!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Can you come up here?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I have a job for you!"
Finn says: "Okay!"
Jake says: "Sorry CB, we'll finish this up later."
Scene changes to inside Princess Bubblegum's lab. Princess Bubblegum is loading small, colorful spheres into a case.
Finn says: "Hey, Preebs."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hey, guys."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I got a letter from the earls of Lemongrab."
Princess Bubblegum says: "They've gone through all the food that I've sent them."
Finn says: "For sure."
Finn says: "We'll do it."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Good luck, gentlemen!"
Finn jumps on Jake who jumps out the window and stretches his ears into wings.
Finn and Jake make their way to Castle Lemongrab and open the gate.
Jake says: "Hey, Lemongrabs!"
Jake says: "You home?"
Finn says: "Holy--!"
They see various Lemon creatures, who start advancing toward them and touching them.
Finn says: "Jake?"
Finn says: "Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!"
Jake says: "Kiss it!"
Finn and Jake start backing away from the creatures through the courtyard.
Finn says: "Aah!"
Finn says: "Sorry, dudes--got no food!"
Finn says: "No..."
Finn says: "food!"
Finn says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "Weirdos!"
Jake says: "Get the birthday cake!"
Jake pretends to throw it, and the Lemon people run over to where they think it landed. Finn and Jake give each other a thumbs up and go through another gate. On the opposite wall is a giant Lemon creature's face.
Lemonjon says: "Are you lemon?"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "What the thing is up with this guy?"
Lemonjon says: "Does your head come to a nub?"
Jake says: "What?"
Lemonjon says: "You are un-lemon."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Cool, man."
Finn says: "Hey, do you know where--?"
Lemonjon says: "I am Lemonjon."
Lemonjon says: "I see you made it past our Lemon mmmmmmmeringerie!"
Finn says: "Wait, what?"
Lemonjon says: "They're quite hungry."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "What the heck's going on here?"
Lemonjon says: "There is no food, only Lemons--Lemons with bellies empty but for lemon lusts!"
Finn says: "Whatever, Lemonjon."
Finn says: "We've gotta give those dumb-butts these seeds."
Jake says: "Where should we go?"
Lemonjon says: "Mmmmmmmy senses tell me that they're in the dungeon."
Lemonjon says: "They've been there for three weeks."
Lemonjon says: "Three weeks, dungeon."
Jake says: "I wonder who put them in there."
Finn says: "I don't know, but we gotta bust them out!"
Finn says: "Which way to the dungeon, Lemonjon?"
Lemonjon picks up a rock with his lips and throws it at the wall, making a hole.
Jake says: "Oh, cool!"
Finn says: "Thanks, man!"
Jake says: "Yeah, thanks, man!"
Finn and Jake make their way down a poorly lit corridor. Something skitters across the screen behind them.
Jake says: "Hmmm."
A brick in the ceiling falls down and shatters. Jake clears his throat and he and Finn walk along the wall past it. Finn opens a door and looks inside. He sees a gigantic heart that isn't pumping and a large pipe dumping yellow liquid through a grate. Finn closes the door.
Jake says: "Hmmm."
They continue down some stairs and come to a door.
Finn says: "Yo, Lemon-wipes!"
Past the door are more gigantic organs, swelling and wriggling.
Jake says: "Yech."
They close the door and walk down a different hallway.
Jake says: "Um, maybe we should hands..."
Jake says: "for safety."
Finn says: "Yeah, sure!"
Jake says: "So, where'd you want to look ne-- Uh, Finn?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Oh, sorry dude."
Creature runs away and Jake catches up to Finn, who is by a door.
Finn says: "Stay close to me."
Inside is a giant pair of kidneys and a small Lemon creature, wailing loudly. It turns to them and its face peels.
Jake says: "Nope!"
Jake hurriedly picks up Finn and kicks open an air duct. He throws Finn inside and follows him in. They fall out the other end into another hallway, at the end of which is a door with bars.
Jake says: "I think this is it."
Finn says: "There they are!"
Finn says: "Hey, Lemongrabs, we're here!"
Finn says: "We're gonna get you out, just hold tight!"
Lemongrab says: "Go away."
Lemongrab 2 says: "No food here."
Jake says: "Maybe the kidnapper's in there, too, coercing them."
Finn says: "Probably the grossest one of all, too--beet red skin, barf, poopin' all its junk-sculpture."
Jake says: "Ah, stop, man!"
Jake says: "You're just makin' it worse!"
Finn says: "Lemongrabs, you're free!"
Lemongrab says: "They broke the door!"
Lemongrab says: "The door is broken now!"
Lemongrab 2 says: "FIX THE DOOR!"
Jake says: "Fix the door?"
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "Fix the door?"
Jake says: "Fix--what?"
Jake says: "What's goin' on here?"
Jake says: "Fix the door."
Jake says: "Finn, what's goin' on?"
Jake says: "Fix the door."
Lemongrab says: "It doesn't matter anymore."
Lemongrab 2 says: "There is no more candy to hoard."
Lemongrab 2 says: "Let them keep what crumbs they find, for there are no crumbs."
Lemongrabs says: "NO CRUMBS!"
Finn says: "Are you saying you locked yourselves down here with all the food so you could eat it yourselves?"
Jake says: "You know there's guys starvin' up there?!"
Jake says: "!"
Lemongrab says: "Hmm."
Lemongrab says: "No, no."
Lemongrab says: "You do not understand."
Lemongrab says: "It is not us for whom they starve, but them..."
Lemongrab 2 says: "..."
Lemongrab 2 says: "for whom they starve."
Lemongrab says: "Mm!"
Lemongrab says: "Yes, yes!"
Lemongrab says: "For the candy food was not consumed--no, no--but was given life!"
Finn says: "Wha--?"
Lemongrab says: "You see, Finn,  when Mother Princess last visited Lemongrab..."
Lemongrab 2 says: "..."
Lemongrab 2 says: "when she saw fit to create me, Lemongrab..."
Lemongrab says: "..."
Lemongrab says: "she left behind a little something-something: the secret formula for creating candy life!"
Lemongrab says: "She must have meant for us to have it, to keep making more family."
Lemongrab 2 says: "Yes, yes!"
Lemongrab 2 says: "All her fault!"
Lemongrab says: "What?"
Lemongrab says: "What'd you say?"
Lemongrab 2 says: "I said, "all her fault."
Lemongrab says: "Oh, indeed!"
Lemongrab says: "For once we had commenced, how could we desist?"
Lemongrab 2 says: "I looked deep in myself and found that I'm a guy who can't stop making candy life from the food he needs."
Lemongrab says: "Me, too."
Lemongrab 2 says: "It just felt so pretty okay inside, greeting each new placid face..."
Lemongrab says: "..."
Lemongrab says: "and hearing each new piercing song!"
Lemongrab 2 says: "We used the last of the food to make Plop-Top, here."
Lemongrab says: "Mm."
Lemongrab says: "I thought we said Dump-Dome."
Lemongrab 2 says: "Who cares anyway?"
Lemongrab 2 says: "They've brought no food!"
Lemongrab 2 says: "We're all going to die!"
Finn says: "Look."
Finn says: "We brought these seeds."
Finn says: "They're special candy seeds."
Jake says: "You can grow new food now."
Lemongrab 2 says: "Yes, yes."
Lemongrab 2 says: "There we go!"
Wad of seeds comes to life and immediately throws up the excess formula.
Lemongrab says: "Ha-haaa!"
Lemongrab says: "We'll call you Seed-Wad!"
Lemongrab 2 says: "Ooh!"
Jake says: "You really are gonna die."
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "and all your boys, too!"
Lemongrab says: "Our..."
Lemongrab says: "boys?"
Finn says: "Come on."
Finn says: "We'll take you to see Princess Bubblegum."
Finn says: "She knows more about candy than anyone; she built a whole kingdom out of candy!"
Lemongrab says: "Yes."
Lemongrab says: "Okay."
Lemongrab 2 says: "For our boys."
Lemongrab says: "But first we will notify the children of our impending departure..."
Lemongrabs says: "..."
Lemongrabs says: "so they won't worry about us while we're away."
Scene changes to room with Lemonjon, where all the Lemon people have gathered.
Lemongrab says: "Okay, yes."
Lemongrab says: "The hard times are over!"
Lemon people cheer.
Lemongrab 2 says: "Mmmm, here's the plan..."
Lemongrab says: "We will go to the Candy Kingdom and take all their candy from them!"
Lemongrab says: "Then we will give that candy precious life and build a candy army so we may then go forth and pillage candy for all to eat!"
Lemongrab 2 says: "Now go, young Lemonjon!"
Lemongrab says: "Go!"
Lemongrab says: "Go!"
Lemongrabs chant 'go' while Lemonjon begins standing up. The castle shakes and pieces of the ceiling start raining down.
Finn says: "What's going on, Lemongrabs?!"
Finn says: "!"
Lemongrab says: "It's all  your fault!"
Lemongrab 2 says: "All your fault!"
Lemongrab says: "We warned you!"
Lemongrab 2 says: "We warned you about us!"
Finn and Jake run out of the room. Lemonjon stands up, tipping Finn and Jake out of the castle. Finn grabs on to the ledge and Jake grabs Finn's other hand.
Finn says: "Yaaaah!"
Finn says: "What the--?"
Finn says: "Whoaaaaaa!"
Jake says: "Whoaaaaaa!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Are you alright?"
Jake says: "Yeah, but look!"
Jake says: "He's heading right for the Candy Kingdom!"
Finn says: "And he's too big to duke it out with!"
Finn says: "Unless..."
Jake says: "Giant poison candy aspirin!"
Jake says: "I've got this one, but it might be too small."
Finn says: "No."
Finn says: "We'll kick him in his heart 'til he's history."
Finn says: "Those must have been Lemonjon's guts we saw before."
Finn says: "His heart is his weak spot."
Jake says: "Yeah, but we'll never find it again in time..."
Jake says: "unless that's it there  with the juice coming out."
Jake says: "Remember all that juice, from before?"
Finn says: "Oh yeah, that's probably it."
Finn says: "Oh, man!"
Jake says: "Tastes like vitamins."
Jake says: "Are you sure this is it?"
Jake says: "It's not even doing anything."
Finn says: "Just smash it already, grandma."
Jake says: "Right."
Heart starts pumping. Finn and Jake are thrown across the room.
Finn says: "Oh, nice one, Jake."
Lemonjon says: "The juice aches."
Lemonjon says: "Is this the rumored ache of feeling?"
Lemonjon says: "The feeling of caring unknown to Lemons?"
Lemonjon says: "New thoughts emerge!"
Lemonjon says: "If I act, the Candy People will suffer."
Lemonjon says: "If I don't, the Lemon people will suffer."
Lemonjon says: "The greater good demands but one course only: that I dissolve the bonds uniting me and become component to all!"
Lemonjon strains and dissolves into millions of small, lemon-shaped candies. Finn, Jake, and the Lemon people fall to the ground.
Finn says: "Whoa, dang!"
Finn says: "That Lemonjon turned himself all up into lemon candy!"
Finn says: "Man, that Lemonjon's all right."
Scene changes to Princess Bubblegum's lab, where she is using a pencil to erase some words from the Lemongrabs' exposed brains.
Princess Bubblegum says: "All done!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "The last trace of the candy life formula is out of their heads!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "and I snatched this  out of the Lemon castle, boyee!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Now we all just have to keep a closer eye on those two so they don't get in to any more trouble."
Jake says: "But how come we don't just fix their hearts like we did with Lemonjon so they're more selfless and less selfish?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, no, no."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Their hearts are fine."
Princess Bubblegum says: "They're just like this."
Lemongrabs says: "Hmm!"
Episode ends.
