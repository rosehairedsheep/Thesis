The episode begins at night, at the Candy Castle. Princess Bubblegum is in her laboratory with Finn, Jake, Peppermint Butler, and Crunchy. Finn is wearing an electronic helmet connected to a monitor, as is Crunchy. A bored Jake sleeps nearby.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Okay."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm going to lower the screen."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Tell me what you see."
Finn says: "Crunchy, you look like a rainbow!"
Finn says: "It's beautiful!"
Finn says: "Can you guys see that?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Nope."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Only you can see it because you're hooked up to the aura visualizer."
Princess Bubblegum says: "But actually I'm lying."
Princess Bubblegum says: "We can see everything you see on this screen."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Now I'm gonna send that image into Crunchy."
Crunchy says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "The aura's gone!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Except..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Crunchy's true essence manifested in the material plane!"
Finn says: "I wanna see Peppermint Butler's aura!"
Peppermint Butler says: "You don't wanna see that!"
Finn says: "Yeah, we do!"
Finn says: "Right, Princess?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Sure, Finn!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Just let me re-calibrate the device!"
Jake says: "No!"
Jake says: "Bunk that, I'm tired!"
Jake says: "C'mon, Finn!"
Finn says: "Oh, yeah."
Finn says: "Yeah, me and Jake, we gotta peace out."
Finn says: "G'night!"
Jake says: "G'night!"
Finn and Jake walk down the dark hallway, to hear beeping noises coming from the Banana Guard's monitoring room. They curiously pop in.
Finn says: "Hey- what's goin' on in here?"
Finn says: "Yo, guys!"
Banana Guards says: "Hey, Finn!"
Finn says: "Whoa, what's that?"
Finn says: "Security cams?"
Banana Guard 1 says: "Yeah, man!"
Banana Guard 1 says: "You gotta see some crazy stuff—"
Banana Guard 2 says: "Yo, shut up!"
Banana Guard 1 says: "Oh, shoot..."
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "What?"
Banana Guard 2 says: "Nothin'!"
Finn says: "What is it?"
Jake says: "What is it?"
Banana Guards says: "Nothing!"
Finn says: "Show us now!"
Jake says: "Show us now!"
Banana Guards says: "Show you what?"
Finn says: "What you said!"
Jake says: "What you said!"
Banana Guards says: "We didn't say nothin'!"
Finn says: "Too late for take-backs!"
Jake says: "Too late for take-backs!"
Finn says: "We practically know everything already!"
Jake says: "We practically know everything already!"
Finn says: "Now show us!"
Jake says: "Now show us!"
Banana Guard 1 says: "Okay, but you can't tell anyone."
Banana Guard 2 says: "Yeah, this is our weird secret."
Jake says: "Of course, dude!"
Banana Guard 1 says: "All right."
Banana Guard 1 says: "Now look at monitor three."
Banana Guard 1 says: "Can you see it?"
Finn says: "Oh, yeah!"
Finn says: "That's, uh..."
Finn says: "Who is that?"
Jake says: "That's Chocoberry."
Jake says: "Why are you guys spyin' on Chocoberry?"
Banana Guard 2 says: "No, man!"
Banana Guard 2 says: "Look there, in the corner!"
Finn says: "Who's that?"
Banana Guard 1 says: "Zoom in, dude!"
Banana Guard 2 says: "Plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus..."
Finn says: "WAAAAAAAAAAAAUH!"
Finn says: "Lemongrab!"
Finn says: "What the—"
Finn says: "?"
Banana Guard 1 says: "This is our weird secret, okay?"
Banana Guard 1 says: "Remember that!"
Scene cuts to the Guard Room a few minutes into the future. In front of the monitors sits an angry Princess Bubblegum, flanked by a group of upset Candy People, who are shouting angrily.
Princess Bubblegum says: "How long has this been going on?"
Banana Guard 1 says: "He's shown up every night for the past two weeks!"
Banana Guard 2 says: "He goes to different rooms and just stands there!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "And you didn't tell me?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Banana Guard 1 says: "If we told you, then we knew you'd mess up our weird TV show!"
Banana Guard 2 says: "Banana guarding is boring!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm gonna talk to him."
Banana Guard 1 says: "Oh, no!"
Banana Guard 1 says: "Ya see?!"
Banana Guard 1 says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Sorry, guys!"
Princess Bubblegum races down the hallway to Chocoberry's room, where she finds Lemongrab, standing by the window, looking suspicious.
