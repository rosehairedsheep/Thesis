In a room in the Candy Castle, Princess Bubblegum is playing trumpet to Finn, Jake, Embryo Princess, the Punch Bowl, and a mudscamp. She finishes, her audience applauds, and she catches her breath.
Princess Bubblegum says: "I made special gloves for it."
Finn gives a thumbs up.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Now check it out!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's logging time."
The creatures blabber indistinctly as one drinks from a thimble. It sprays the drink upward into a mist and starts kissing the other one as the mist falls over them. They then continue blabbering.
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'll set the clock back now."
The two creatures back away as they watch their past selves rewind.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Now I'll push the time travel button."
The two creatures scream as their molecules reset to where they were when the sphere was first placed around them. They continue blabbering.
Jake says: "Eh..."
Jake says: "It's not really time travel, though."
Jake says: "You just, you know, moved their stuff around."
Jake says: "You didn't really manipulate time."
Jake says: "Ice King's done it better before..."
Jake says: "with magic."
Mudscamp says: "Well, I enjoyed your presentation very much, Princess."
Mudscamp says: "Thank you for inviting me."
Princess Bubblegum says: "No!"
Lumpy Space Princess is shown sleeping in the gutter outside.
Princess Bubblegum says: "For all intents and purposes, they traveled back to an earlier point in their time."
Lumpy Space Princess wakes up.
Jake says: "Eh, I guess, but not really."
Lumpy Space Princess peaks through the open window.
Jake says: "I mean, Ice King did it for real."
Jake says: "Guy pulled his fiancée out of time from a thousand years ago using magic."
Lumpy Space Princess sneaks in and slithers under Jake's chair.
Mudscamp says: "Hey, time, where's my fiancée?"
Mudscamp says: "Am I right?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Jake, don't deny my science."
Princess Bubblegum says: "This is a time travel machine."
Lumpy Space Princess's eyes widen. She throws aside Jake's chair with him still in it and floats toward the sphere.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Take me back to when my ex-boyfriend Brad still loved me!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "LSP..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Wha?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "LSP, that's not how it works."
Princess Bubblegum says: "It can only rearrange your molecules into a previously logged formation, and you need these gloves."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Give them to me."
Princess Bubblegum says: "No."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You witch!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Give them to me now!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "No, I'm sorry, but you need to pull yourself to—"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You skunk!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You skunk!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You pretty skunk!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You don't know heartache with the whole Candy Kingdom in love with your pretty bubblegum buns!"
Princess Bubblegum hits her with her crown, knocking her into a bookshelf.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Glob!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hear me, Lumpy Space Princess, I will avoid declaring war on the entirety of Lumpy Space, ruled by your parents, if you apologize to me immediately."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm sorry-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y..."
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Punch Bowl says: "Whoa!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Sheesh!"
At the Candy Tavern, Tree Trunks is singing "Slow Boat to China" to Mr. Pig while various other Candy Tavern People sit around.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Everyone in here is a loser."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Nobody's as good as Brad."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, Brad!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Why can't I get over you?"
Bartender says: "Have you tried burning an effigy?"
Bartender says: "That's what they do in movies."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "This isn't a movie, Charlie, it's real life!"
Bartender says: "Another cucumber water, Your Majesty?"
Lumpy Space Princess nods, and Charlie leaves. Lumpy Space Princess notices a blue Lumpy Space Person staring at her.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What?"
Lumpy Space Person says: "Oh, I—"
Lumpy Space Person says: "I'm sorry for staring, but, uh, I—"
Lumpy Space Person says: "I know you."
Lumpy Space Person says: "We used to—"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Everyone knows me."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm Lumpy Space Princess."
Lumpy Space Person says: "No, uh, from high school."
Lumpy Space Person says: "W-we were lab partners."
Lumpy Space Person says: "I'm Johnnie."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Ugly Johnnie?"
Johnnie says: "Y-yeah, uh, you used to call me that quite a bit."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Yeah, but I can't call you that anymore!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Come on, sit up straight."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Lemme see them eyes."
Johnnie says: "Mm."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Do it."
He sits up straight and stares at Lumpy Space Princess.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Nope."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Can't call you that anymore."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "So, what brings you to the Candy Kingdom, Johnnie?"
Johnnie says: "Business, uh, actually."
Johnnie says: "I own my own company, bottling and distributing Lumpy gas."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Mm-hmm."
Johnnie says: "And I'm up for a big contract, uh, here in the kingdom, which could really help my business "take off," so to speak."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "That's so cool."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You're like your own boss or whatever."
Johnnie says: "To be honest, I'm a little nervous about this meeting tomorrow."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Why, Johnnie?"
Johnnie says: "I'm bad at talking to people."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "That's because you have poor posture."
Johnnie says: "Really?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You gotta stop slouching!"
Johnnie sits up straight.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Now look me in the eye!"
He does so.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Yeah, stay like that."
Johnnie says: "Boy, LSP, heh, you sure are making me feel good about myself."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You feeling good makes me feel good, Johnnie."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "So..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "where are you staying while you're in town?"
Johnnie says: "I'm sub-letting a friend's apartment."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Talk is cheap, Johnnie."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You should take me there."
They arrive at Johnnie's apartment. Johnnie points to a chair.
Johnnie says: "That chair—"
Johnnie says: "oh, it used to be over there, but I moved it."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Johnnie, it's so nice."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You've really made it your own."
Johnnie says: "Thanks."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Ooh, records!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Okay, wanna see something funny?"
Johnnie says: "Yeah."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Okay."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Okay."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Sit down!"
The two sit on the couch.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Okay, are you ready?"
Johnnie says: "Heh-heh, yeah!"
Johnnie says: "It's his face, but on your body!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I know!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "That's the joke."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "My friend Melissa and I came up with that."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You're smart that you get it."
Johnnie says: "Boy, when this evening started, I was feeling so dump trucks, but now it's like a hundred forklifts!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I feel the same way, Johnnie."
Johnnie says: "Do you feel this couch?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What?"
Johnnie says: "'Cause it's where you're gonna sleep!"
They both laugh.
Johnnie says: "Seriously."
Johnnie says: "It's getting late, and I don't want you walking home."
Johnnie says: "So I insist."
Johnnie says: "I'll be in the other room, sleeping peacefully..."
Johnnie says: "and dreaming about you."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Johnnie..."
Johnnie says: "Thank you..."
Johnnie says: "for everything."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Johnnie..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "go to bed already."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You have a big day tomorrow."
Johnnie says: "Good night!"
In the morning, Johnnie opens his door.
Johnnie says: "Rise and shine!"
Johnnie says: "I hope you like pancakes 'cause I got—"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Looking for someone?"
Johnnie says: "You're still here!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "'Course I am!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Now make me some breakfast!"
After breakfast.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Okay, Johnnie, good luck at your meeting."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "And remember, I'll be right over there,  sending you good vibes while you're wowing Princess Bubblegum."
Her words echo in Johnnie's head as he sits in a chair waiting for the meeting.
Banana Guard says: "Yo, why are you so confident, man?"
Banana Guard says: "Aren't you nervous to meet the princess?"
Johnnie says: "Nope!"
Johnnie says: "My GF is back at my place sending me good vibes."
At Johnnie's apartment, Lumpy Space Princess is slouched on the couch in front of the TV.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Johnnie's friend has so many movie channels."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Ha-ha, that movie was so dumb."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, poop!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Johnnie's meeting!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I wonder how it went."
The light turns on.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Johnnie!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, Johnnie, you're home!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "How'd it go?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, don't keep me in suspense, Johnnie!"
Johnnie says: "I did it, babe!"
Johnnie says: "I landed the sale!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Johnnie, that's wonderful!"
Johnnie says: "And I couldn't have done it without you."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I know!"
Johnnie says: "And here's the best part!"
Johnnie says: "She wants me back at the castle tonight to go over the contracts during a royal dinner."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, my Glob!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "It's gonna be so nice to have dinner inside the castle."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "It's been a while."
Johnnie says: "Oh."
Johnnie says: "No."
Johnnie says: "It's a business meeting, not social."
Johnnie says: "Just me and the princess, I'm afraid."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What?!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "!"
Johnnie says: "LSP?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "So..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Bubblegum thinks she can horn in on my territory?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Sip from my soup after I cut all the onions?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Yo, think again, tranch."
Mudscamp says: "Who—"
Mudscamp says: "who are you talking to?"
The scene cuts to the royal dinner.
Princess Bubblegum says: "So how are you enjoying your time in the Candy Kingdom?"
Johnnie says: "Oh, it's just great."
Johnnie says: "I met this amazing purple girl at the Candy Tavern."
Princess Bubblegum says: "That's wonderful, Johnnie."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Now tell me more about gas..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Eh, ehh."
The truck rolls up the castle steps and explodes inside, rocking the whole castle.
Johnnie says: "Can I help?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "No."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hide yourself beneath the tablecloth."
Princess Bubblegum says: "There's cyanide-laced gum under the table."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Chew it if you hear raiders break down the door."
Johnnie says: "Okay."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Hi, Johnnie."
Johnnie says: "What are you doing here?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm going to time-travel you back to when we first met at the tavern—"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "back to when you loved me—"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "so we can have a second chance."
Johnnie says: "What?"
Lumpy Space Princess places the sphere around Johnnie's head and pushes a button on her glove, sending Johnnie's head's molecules into limbo.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Uh!"
At the site of the explosion, Manfried is fighting the fire with a garden hose.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Manfried, where are the Banana Guards?"
Manfried says: "Take a chill pill, Princess."
Manfried says: "I handled it."
Princess Bubblegum says: "What did you handle?"
Manfried says: "You know."
Manfried says: "Someone drove their car in the door, but no one was driving, and it exploded, so I handled it."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Mmm."
At the Candy Tavern, Tree Trunks is still singing the same song while Lumpy Space Princess is looking around expectantly.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Johnnie?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "C'mon."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Sit up straight."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Let me see them eyes."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Ha-ha."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Uh."
Princess Bubblegum says: "He's not here."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "But I sent him back."
Princess Bubblegum says: "The sphere would have had to log his molecules before you engaged the time travel function."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Well, then where is he?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I don't know."
Johnnie's head begins materializing in the border around the screen.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Then if he's gone, can you send me back..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "?"
Johnnie's body materializes in the border.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "To before I met him so I won't have to remember this heartache?!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "If that's what you want."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Do it."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Do it!"
Princess Bubblegum places the sphere around Lumpy Space Princess and pushes buttons on her glove, sending Lumpy Space Princess's molecules back to when she first entered the sphere. Meanwhile, in the border, Johnnie reunites his head and body.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You witch!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Give them to—"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "huh, wha?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Where are we?"
Johnnie reaches out to Lumpy Space Princess.
Princess Bubblegum says: "You asked me to use this."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Don't touch me!"
Johnnie bows his head, crestfallen, as the border fades to black.
Episode ends.
