The episode begins at the Candy Hospital. A crowd is hovering over Princess Bubblegum as she's pushed on a gurney.
Nurse Pound Cake says: "What's her condition, Dr."
Nurse Pound Cake says: "Ice Cream?"
Dr. Ice Cream says: "She's totally gross over 90% of her body."
Dr. Ice Cream says: "The other 10% is crazy nasty."
Nurse Pound Cake says: "Will she make it, Doctor?"
Dr. Ice Cream says: "We're losing 'er!!"
Ice King says: "No!"
Ice King says: "Not my number one!"
Ice King says: "Princess, if you die on me, I will never forgive you!"
Ice King says: "I'll be lost—"
Ice King says: "lost in my own emotional labyri—"
Finn says: "YAAAAAH!!"
Dr. Ice Cream says: "Wait, Finn!"
Finn says: "What!"
Finn says: "?"
Dr. Ice Cream says: "Her sugar levels are stabilizing."
Princess Bubblegum regains her normal body shape. Everyone starts cheering. "Yaaay! She's alright!".
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yes, I'm fine."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I just need to rest."
Ice King says: "Oh, my wife!"
Ice King says: "Is there anything weird about her?"
Ice King says: "I can't see through these pain tears!"
Dr. Ice Cream says: "She's fine."
Dr. Ice Cream says: "Why?"
Ice King says: "It's just that..."
Ice King says: "after Princess fell into the well, I saw something strange happen."
Ice King says: "Something I still don't understand."
Ice King says: "Ooh—"
Ice King says: "AGH!"
Ice King says: "Wait!"
Ice King says: "Listen to me!!"
Finn says: "NO!"
Finn says: "Just shut your mouth, old man!"
Ice King says: ""Old man?"
Ice King says: "" Heh!"
Ice King says: "What?"
Ice King says: "I'm not old."
Jake says: "Uh, yeah, you are, dude."
Everyone agrees with Jake. "You are pretty old." "Yes, you are." "You're old.".
Ice King says: "Old?"
Ice King says: "I'm..."
Ice King says: "I see."
Ice King says: "It's all making sense now."
Ice King says: "Brrrrapapo!"
Ice King says: "Nobody in the world."
Finn says: "JUST GET OUT OF HERE!!"
Ice King says: "Peace."
He makes a peace sign then exits while waving solemnly. Finn sighs.
Finn says: "Sorry about that, Peebles."
Princess Bubblegum says: "The ice wizard is a weak fool..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "."
Jake says: "Huh?"
Raggedy Princess says: "Finn!"
Raggedy Princess says: "Finn!"
Raggedy Princess says: "The other princesses and I made you a new backpack!"
Finn says: "Whoa, Raggedy Princess!"
Finn says: "It's so awesome!"
Finn says: "Thank you."
Jake says: "You look like sick, grey meat, but we're gonna jack you up so awesome."
Finn says: "We should wheel 'er to her bedroom, right?"
Jake says: "Yeah, man, and then we'll do magic tricks."
Princess Bubblegum closes her eyes.
Finn says: "Like fake magic?"
Jake says: "Yeah, like  bruh bruh bruh, bruh..."
Scene shifts to Princess Bubblegum's bedroom.
Finn says: "Princess..."
Jake says: "Princess..."
Finn says: "Princess..."
Jake says: "Princess..."
Finn says: "Surprise!"
Jake says: "Surprise!"
Finn says: "We picked every flower in the Candy Kingdom just for you!"
Jake says: "Whoo-oo!"
She says nothing.
Finn says: "Princess Bubblegum?"
She makes a strange guttural noise and irregularly bends her body.
Jake says: "Oh, jeez!!"
Jake says: "What's wrong with Princess Bubblegum?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Quiet, dude."
Finn says: "We're supposed to take care of her, not make her feel bad!"
Jake says: "I know, man, but she just seems..."
Jake says: "weird."
Finn says: "She's just messed up from the accident, man."
Finn says: "We just have to take care of her 'til she feels better."
Jake says: "Uh..."
Jake says: "Okay, dude."
They look at the bed and gasp; she's gone. Sounds are heard from the bathroom. They go there.
Finn says: "Princess!"
Finn says: "Princess, no!"
Finn says: "You shouldn't be out of bed!"
Jake says: "Oh."
Jake says: "Gotcha."
Jake says: "I'll go get some tea!"
Finn says: "Princess..."
Finn says: "this sweater you made me kept me safe."
Finn says: "I almost got super messed up, but..."
Finn says: "it saved me."
Finn says: "And I wanted to say..."
Finn says: "thank you for imbuing this sweater with the power of liking someone a lot."
Finn says: "Because..."
Finn says: "I like you a lot."
Finn says: "Haha, uh..."
Finn says: "We shouldn't talk about this now."
Finn says: "You should rest."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I need you to get me some things..."
Finn says: "Yes, Princess."
Jake says: "Whoa..."
Jake says: "Uh..."
Jake says: "somethin' weird's goin' on..."
Finn says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "AH!"
Finn says: "I'm gonna get some stuff for PB."
Finn says: "Be right back."
Jake makes a worried noise. He turns and looks at the princess who is breathing deeply and creepily.
Jake says: "Oh!"
Jake says: "I'll sing you a song!"
Jake says: "You love it when I sing songs!"
Jake grabs a pink microphone and small speaker, and forms bongos on his stomach, beginning to sing his song. Princess Bubblegum is visibly annoyed and suddenly has a deeper voice. She growls and puts her hand in a bush, wilting every single flower in the room.
Jake says: "Uh..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Jake..."
Jake says: "AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!"
Jake says: "Yo, dude!"
Jake says: "Wait!"
Jake says: "What's all that biz?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Uh, bleach, lighter fluid, ammonia, gasoline, I dunno."
Finn says: "Lady stuff."
Finn says: "Plutonium..."
Princess Bubblegum exits the room.
Jake says: "No, man..."
Jake says: "no..."
Jake says: "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
Finn says: "No probs!"
Jake says: "Wait!"
Jake says: "Hold on!"
Finn says: "What's up?"
Jake says: "Listen..."
Jake says: "PB's bed was on fire."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Is she okay?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "She made it on fire."
Finn says: "With a match?"
Jake says: "No, man."
Jake says: "With her brain..."
Jake says: "I think..."
Jake says: "Look, man, I'll show you!"
Finn says: "Jake, wh—"
Jake says: "Shh!!"
Jake says: "P-P-P-Princess..."
Jake says: "?"
Finn says: "PB?"
Finn says: "You in there?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm busy!"
Finn says: "See?"
Finn says: "It's fine."
Finn says: "She's just havin' private time."
Jake says: "I'm lookin' in!"
Finn says: "JAKE, WHAT THE HEY?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Oh, my gloob!"
Finn says: "Come on, man, that's pervy!"
Jake says: "You don't even know, man."
Finn says: "DUDE?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Look!"
Jake says: "See it!"
Princess Bubblegum's skin is now black, and her shape has changed tremendously. She's putting the ingredients from before into the tub and drinking it.
Finn says: "Hold on, Peebles!"
Finn says: "AAH!"
Finn says: "PUT DOWN THE TUB!"
She throws it down and knocks Finn and Jake through a wall. Ice King is revealed to have been listening in. Princess Bubblegum smashes her way out of the castle.
Gumball Guardian says: "Evil presence detected!!"
Gumball Guardian says: "Must defend!!"
Back at the Candy Castle.
Ice King says: "Hey, Finn, are you dead or what?"
Finn says: "Whaaah?"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Ice King?"
Finn says: "What are you doing here?"
Ice King says: "Hey."
Ice King says: "I had to keep an eye on the princess because she's being possessed by the Lich."
Finn says: "You don't know that."
Ice King says: "But I do."
Ice King says: "I saw it with my wizard eyes!"
Ice King says: "Guys, let me help you."
Ice King says: "I don't want my future wife to be..."
Ice King says: "physically unattractive."
Finn says: "Listen, you old poot."
Finn says: "I'm not going to let you kill 'er twice."
Finn says: "GET STUFFED."
Finn says: "Come on, Jake."
Ice King groans in sadness as they exit.
Finn says: "We're coming, Princess!"
Jake says: "Dude!"
Jake says: "I think we should let the Ice King help!"
Jake says: "He can freeze her, which could buy us some t—"
Finn says: "Dump that mess!"
Finn says: "I'mma set 'er free with my like-like sweater!"
Jake says: "Woooh, do it!"
Finn says: "I like you, Princess!!"
Princess Bubblegum punches Finn, who screams.
Jake says: "Finn!!"
Finn is knocked back to the castle, next to a forlorn Ice King.
Finn says: "Urrgh..."
Finn says: "Ice King, I..."
Finn says: "I need you to freeze Princess Bubblegum."
Finn says: "Will you help me?"
Ice King says: "Are you suuuuure?"
Finn says: "Yes."
Ice King says: "Great!"
Ice King says: "Weeee!"
They fly towards her.
Finn says: "I'll distract 'er up top, you freeze 'er legs!"
Ice King says: "Wah!"
Finn says: "I'M A CAT!"
Finn says: "I'M AN AGILE CAT!"
Finn says: "JAKE!"
Finn says: "DUCK!"
Finn says: "Thanks, bird!"
The Candy People gather around and cheer.
Ice King says: "Yeah!"
Ice King says: "Whoopie!"
Finn says: "You did good, Ice King."
Ice King says: "Oh, yeah?"
Finn says: "Yeah, man."
Suddenly, Princess Bubblegum topples over and her body is totally shattered. Finn looks at Jake, who both have  a look of utter and total shock and horror.
Ice King says: "Okay."
Ice King says: "I didn't kill 'er this time."
Ice King says: "Everybody saw that, right?"
Gumball Guardian says: "Duuuude..."
Finn says: "We gotta get 'er to the hospital!"
Scene shifts back to the hospital.
Dr. Ice Cream says: "Start assembling!"
Dr. Ice Cream says: "Here, try to connect these two pieces!"
Dr. Ice Cream says: "Give me more pieces, Doctor Princess!"
Dr. Princess says: "That's all we have, Dr."
Dr. Princess says: "Ice Cream!"
Dr. Ice Cream says: "What?!"
Dr. Ice Cream says: "!"
Dr. Ice Cream says: "That can't be!"
Nurse Pound Cake says: "What do we do, Doctor?"
Dr. Ice Cream says: "..."
Dr. Ice Cream says: "I don't know, Nurse Pound Cake."
Outside the emergency room, everyone is chattering.
Finn says: "I hope she's okay..."
Nurse Pound Cake says: "Attention, everyone..."
Finn says: "IS PB OKAY?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "?"
Nurse Pound Cake says: "Yes..."
Nurse Pound Cake says: "but there were some complications."
Finn says: "NOOOOOOO!!!!"
Nurse Pound Cake says: "Yes..."
Nurse Pound Cake says: "I'm afraid..."
Nurse Pound Cake says: "there wasn't enough gum to work with, so it appears Princess Bubblegum is now..."
Nurse Pound Cake says: "..."
Nurse Pound Cake says: "younger."
Nurse Pound Cake says: "She's 13 years old now."
Ice King says: "Aw, dang it!"
Ice King says: "Well, I'm outta here."
Ice King says: "Goodbye, everyone."
Finn says: "13 years old?"
Finn says: "That's how old I am."
Finn says: "Uh..."
Jake says: "Whoa..."
She walks up to him.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Give me a hug, hero."
Everyone cheers. Finn embraces her. Suddenly the camera pans menacingly past the crowd and reveals the waving snail—possessed by the Lich. The story ends.
