The episode opens at the Tree House.
Jake says: "Finn?"
"Finn" says: "Yo."
Jake says: "Oh, hey."
Jake says: "Me and BMO are heading over to the vuvuzela store in the Music Kingdom."
Jake says: "You want to come with?"
Jake says: "I got to get a new vuvuzela."
Jake says: "Somebody keeps smashing my old one."
BMO says: "I can't bear this burden any longer!"
BMO says: "It was me!"
BMO says: "I'm the vuvuzela smasher!"
Jake says: "BMO, how could you?"
Neptr says: "No, it was me!"
Neptr says: "I'm the vuvuzela smasher."
Jake says: "Neptr?!"
Jake says: "!"
"Finn" says: "No, I'm the vuvuzela smasher."
Jake says: "All right, all right."
Jake says: "Well, I'm still getting one."
Jake says: "You coming?"
"Finn" says: "Nah, me and Fi-..."
"Finn" says: "Fern are supposed to clean out the chicken coop today."
"Finn" says: "And if anyone tries to stop me, I'll slash their flipping faces off."
Jake says: "True, true."
Jake says: "Okay, well, I'll see you later then."
Jake says: "Come on, BMO."
Jake and BMO exit down the ladder. Neptr exits too.
BMO says: "Jake, I'm sorry!"
BMO says: "I really am the smasher!"
Jake says: "Ah, don't sweat it buddy."
Suddenly, a second Finn pokes his head in from upstairs.
Finn says: "Hyup!"
Finn says: "You're getting new powers like every day now."
Finn says: "Let me see you do Jake - no, wait, Ice King!"
Finn says: "Do Ice King!"
Fern says: "Ha, nah, man."
Fern says: "Imitating uncool people infects you with their loserishness."
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Yeah, that rings true."
Finn says: "It's too bad you didn't develop any coop-poop-scooping skills."
Finn says: "That coop is incredibly disgusting."
Fern says: "Actually, about that, I was thinking that, instead, maybe you and I could explore some secret ruins I found."
Finn says: "Secret ruins?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Sweet!"
Finn says: "Maybe we can still catch up with Jake and BMO!"
Finn says: "Or maybe Neptr could come!"
Finn says: "Hey, Neptr, you want to go on an adventure, buddy?!"
Finn says: "!"
Neptr says: "Oh my glob!"
Neptr says: "Hold on!"
Fern says: "Actually, I was thinking maybe just you and me would go."
Fern says: "Spend some quality time together, Finn and Fern style."
Finn says: "Yeah, okay."
Finn says: "That actually even sounds like something Jake would want us to do."
Finn says: "â™ª Dungeon surprise, right before my eyes, what a surprise, the dungeon surprise."
As Finn is leaving, Fern's eyes briefly change into someone else's, and he stares menacingly. The scene changes. Finn and Fern are walking through a savannah, playing rock paper scissors. They keep picking the same thing.
Finn says: "One, two, three - shoot!"
Fern says: "One, two, three - shoot!"
Finn says: "Rock!"
Fern says: "Rock!"
Finn says: "One, two, three - shoot!"
Fern says: "One, two, three - shoot!"
Finn says: "Scissors!"
Fern says: "Scissors!"
Finn says: "This is so weird."
Finn says: "I can't tell if it's boring or fun."
Fern says: "Well, I can."
Fern says: "It's boring."
Fern says: "I want the thrill of victory!"
Fern says: "Who wants to be the same all the time?"
Finn says: "Come on, man!"
Finn says: "You know you love it!"
Finn says: "Come on!"
Finn says: "One, two, three..."
Finn says: "Come on!"
Finn says: "One, two, three - shoot!"
Fern says: "One, two, three - shoot!"
Fern says: "Rock."
Finn says: "Paper."
Fern says: "What?!"
Fern says: "!"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "I won this time."
Fern says: "What?"
Fern says: "But that's not fair!"
Fern says: "Why is nothing ever fair?"
Finn says: "Hey, Fern, it's just a game."
Finn says: "Don't be so weird."
Fern says: "Don't-!"
Fern says: "..."
Fern says: "Don't call me that."
Finn says: "Sorry."
Fern says: "Ah, it's okay."
Fern says: "That stuff won't mean a thing."
Fern says: "I mean, that stuff don't mean a thing."
Fern says: "Hey, come on, we're almost there!"
Fern says: "Whoop, whoop, whoop!"
Finn says: "Hey, wait up!"
Finn says: "Whoop, whoop!"
Fern says: "Whoop, whoop whoop!"
Finn says: "Whoop, whoop, whoop!"
Fern says: "Whoop, whoop, whoop!"
Finn says: "Whoop, whoop!"
Fern says: "Whoop, whoop!"
Fern says: "Look, we're here!"
Finn says: "Where?"
Finn says: "I just see a bunch of rock, swear to glob."
Fern says: "But check this out."
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Magic key!"
Fern says: "I had to chop up a bunch of stubborn so-and-sos to get my hands on this baby."
Finn says: "Dang."
Finn says: "You've been busy."
They enter. Behind the rock wall is a ziggurat.
Finn says: "Wow, would you look at that!"
Finn says: "They hid this ziggurat in the cliff side."
Finn says: "Amazing!"
Finn says: "Dut, dut, dut!"
Finn says: "No spoilers!"
Fern says: "No, I know."
Fern says: "I didn't go past the first level."
Fern says: "I was saving it to do together."
Finn says: "Sweet."
Finn says: "Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya!"
Fern says: "Come on."
Finn says: "Hey, Fern, wait up."
Finn says: "Hey, I just want to say that it's really cool that you're into this stuff."
Finn says: "You know - that we have so much in common."
Finn says: "It feels almost like we're real brothers, right?"
Finn says: "Or even closer."
Fern says: "Hmm."
Fern says: "Fascinating."
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Uh, okay."
Finn says: "I guess just holler if you need me."
Finn says: "Contemporary chair, contemporary trash, contemporary meatloaf?"
Finn says: "Hey, bad news, Fern."
Finn says: "It looks like we've got a squatter situation here."
Fern pulls out the key. His eyes glow menacingly again.
Finn says: "I think they got the treasure, but they left some meatloaf behind."
Fern inserts the key into a rune and a stone door slides shut, trapping Finn inside the chamber.
Finn says: "What the?"
Finn says: "Fern?"
Finn says: "Uh, Fern?"
Finn says: "I think maybe the wind blew the door shut."
Finn says: "An "act of nature", I would presume."
Fern says: "I'm sorry."
Fern says: "I don't actually know how to make meatloaf."
Fern says: "That's just a pan of dirt."
Finn says: "Well, that's okay."
Finn says: "I don't know how to either!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Fern, please open the door."
Fern pushes out a single brick so that they can talk to each other more easily.
Fern says: "This is where you live now."
Fern says: "You'll be fine."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Fern, what about Jake and BMO - my home?"
Fern says: "It's been your home long enough."
Fern says: "It's Fern's turn."
Fern says: "I think I'm going to be a really great Finn."
Fern says: "Hey, do you know who my favorite is?"
Fern says: "It's Neptr."
Fern says: "I'm a Neptr guy!"
Fern says: "I'll be back in a month with a new bucket of trash."
Fern says: "Later!"
Finn says: "Fern!"
Finn says: "?"
Finn says: "There's got to be something useful in here."
He pulls out the red bucket from earlier and compares it to the blue bucket of trash on the floor. With a yell, he tries barging down the door again, still to no avail.
Finn says: "You'll be back in a month?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "With a new bucket of trash?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "It's hot!"
Finn says: "There's no air in here!"
Finn says: "I need air!"
Finn says: "I need air!"
There is a whirring sound. His robotic arm has turned into a fan.
Finn says: "Wha?"
Finn says: "Uh, hello."
The arm beeps, and a pre-recorded hologram of Princess Bubblegum is projected from it.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hi, Finn!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "You're still asleep after your fight with Susan."
Princess Bubblegum says: "But when you wake up, I'm sure you'll have fun discovering everything your new arm can do."
Princess Bubblegum says: "And Finn, sincerely, thank you for defending our kingdom again."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Someone else wants to thank you, too."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I don't know."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Okay, um..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Welcome, Finn!"
The video feed ends and a menu appears showing all of the arm's functions, including the fan which Finn was just using.
Finn says: "Huh."
Finn scrolls through the functions until he finds a rock drill.
Finn says: "Yes!"
He scrolls some more and finds a "weed whacker". The scene changes. Fern, disguised as Finn, is walking away from the ziggurat, carrying a bunch of flowers. A buzzing is heard, and the real Finn suddenly runs at him from behind.
Fern says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "You donked up!"
Fern says: "Aah!"
The two of them spar. Finn slices into Fern's back with the weed whacker.
Fern says: "Hey!"
Fern headlocks Finn, but Finn manages to break it and throws him aside. Fern's eyes change for a brief moment.
Finn says: "What do you think you're doing?!"
Finn says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm weed whacking."
Fern says: "You've been Finn long enough!"
Fern says: "It's my turn."
Finn says: "Fern, smarten up!"
Fern says: "Nuh-uh!"
Finn says: "What are you?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "A weed whacker."
Fern hisses and draws his sword. He strikes at Finn, who catches the blade in the fingers of his bionic arm. They begin to duel. Finn strikes Fern and mows a chunk of his head. Fern hisses and slashes back at Finn, leaving a shallow gash in his belly.
Finn says: "My belzer!"
Fern tackles Finn to the ground. He has his sword at Finn's neck, while Finn's weed whacker arm is lodged in Fern's belly without enough power to spin.
Finn says: "Fern, if things are going down the way I think they're going down, please tell Jake I love him."
Fern says: "That doesn't matter."
Fern says: "I love him!"
Finn says: "I know you do, Fern."
Finn says: "Listen, we can stop this and just go home together."
Finn says: "All this lying and fighting, it doesn't have to end like this."
Finn says: "Today doesn't have to have this kind of..."
Finn says: "finality."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Fatality!"
The weed whacker suddenly gets a burst of torque and fully enters into Fern's belly. Fern's face twists disturbingly as the blades spin inside him, and eventually, he bursts into a cloud of grass, which falls down onto Finn and the surrounding landscape. The scene changes back to the Tree Fort. Jake and BMO are back, and BMO is trying to break Jake's new vuvuzela. The door is heard.
Jake says: "Hey, boys!"
Jake says: "Y'all have fun out there?"
Jake says: "Wait, what happened?"
Finn opens his mouth to speak, but no words come out.
Finn breaks into tears. Jake and BMO go to comfort him. The scene goes back to the grasslands outside the ziggurat. A mysterious individual is gathering Fern's remains into a yellow bucket.
Mysterious individual says: "Almost done, champ."
Mysterious individual says: "There you go."
Mysterious individual says: "You looking for an uncle?"
Episode ends.
