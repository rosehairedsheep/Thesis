Jake says: "Willy!"
Finn says: "Oh, Willy!"
Jake says: "Oh, Willy!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Sh!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "There it is."
Princess Bubblegum says: "The weeping Willy."
Princess Bubblegum says: "One drop of its rare sap can flavor an entire stock pot of soup."
Clone James says: "Danger, danger!"
Clone James says: "Whoop whoop!"
Clone James says: "Loose gravel!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "James?"
Clone James says: "Look out princess!"
Clone James says: "Poot poot poot shooh!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Ow!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "James!"
Finn says: "James!"
Jake says: "James!"
Clone James says: "Remember me!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, not this again."
James says: "I'm registering mondo mega rads down there."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Oh, my garf!"
Finn says: "What are they?!"
Finn says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "They're toxic creatures, from another time."
Jake says: "It can't end like this."
Finn says: "James!"
Finn says: "I wanted to do it."
Finn says: "Why didn't you let me?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Someone was going to have to eat the big one to save the others."
Princess Bubblegum says: "And even though he is gone, and it's super sad, I would like to honor James… With this new James I whipped up in the lab!"
Banana Guards unveil the new James.
Clone James says: "Jeet!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Here you go, James—"
Finn says: "Wow."
Finn says: "James sacrificed his life for you again, PB."
Jake says: "Yeah, that's like the twenty-fifth time, right?"
Finn says: "Yeah, obviously we'll have to re-clone him."
Jake says: "Totes."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Now hold up."
Princess Bubblegum says: "This ground is perfectly solid."
Princess Bubblegum says: "There's no loose gravel here."
Jake says: "So what?"
Jake says: "Clone him up, girl."
Princess Bubblegum says: "James is too reckless."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I can't reward this kind of foolish behavior forever."
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's time James takes his eternal nap."
Finn says: "But it's James!"
Jake says: "Come P-Gum, don't be all cold-hearty!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm putting my foot down."
Princess Bubblegum says: "There will be no more Jameses."
Finn says: "No..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm sorry."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Look, I need you guys to go to James's apartment and box up his stuff."
Jake says: "And remember the time James saved PB from that contaminated cupcake?"
Finn says: "Yeah, he ate that whole cupcake."
Finn says: "What a guy..."
Finn says: "Is this..."
Finn says: "James heaven?"
Jake says: "Alright, who's in charge here?"
Finn says: "James..."
James II says: "Uh, I'm James number 2."
James II says: "The original James got all goopy in the desert."
Jake says: "Explain this biz, James II."
James II says: "Well..."
James II says: "I was lonely!"
James II says: "I knew Princess Bubs would make a new James if, you know, a James died a hero."
James II says: "So..."
Finn says: "You faked your own death?"
James II says: "Yeah!"
James II says: "I just wanted a friend."
James II says: "Someone who gets me!"
Finn says: "James..."
James II says: "Plus, each time I get kerplonked, I get another shiny medal, and why have two medals if you can have all the medals?"
James II says: "Medals, medals, medals..."
Finn says: "Dude, I've been to your funeral like twenty-five times."
James II says: "What?"
James II says: "The medals make me happy."
James II says: "Plus, PLUS!"
James II says: "It's a constant party here in  Jamestown!"
Jake says: "PB ain't gonna like this."
Finn says: "Hmm hmm!"
James II says: "Wait, don't tell her!"
James II says: "I'll give you a medal."
Jake says: "Nah, man."
Jake says: "PB's no dummy."
Jake says: "She'll find out."
Jake says: "It's only a matter of time."
Finn says: "We like you James but, you're on your own."
Finn says: "We're gonna sit this one out."
Finn and Jake go outside, sit on a bench while laughing.
Finn says: "This should be good."
Jake says: "There's Princess Bubblegum!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "James!"
Jake says: "What a show!"
Finn says: "Very enjoyable!"
Finn and Jake are sitting on the Candy Kingdom's walls and eating it while watching Princess Bubblegum and the banana guards.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Okay, who's the Banana Guard Leader for this week?"
Banana Guard Leader says: "I'm the leader."
Princess Bubblegum says: "This picture should help you find the Jameses."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Hey guys, it's the picture of one of the perpetrators."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Take a good look."
Banana Guards says: "Ooooh!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "There's twenty-five of them."
Banana Guard Leader says: "I need to see the other twenty-four pictures."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Nope, you only need that one."
Banana Guard Leader says: "What?"
Banana Guard Leader says: "How can one picture identify twenty-five perpetrators?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's because they all look the same."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Oh okay, I see."
Banana Guard Leader says: "There's twenty-five of them!"
Banana Guard Leader says: "They all look like this guy!"
Banana Guard I says: "Huh, how can twenty-five guys look like one guy?"
Banana Guard I says: "You mean they're viginti-quintuplets?"
Banana Guard Leader says: "You mean they're viginti-quintuplets?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "No!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "They're clones."
Banana Guard Leader says: "What are clones?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "A group of organisms or cells produced asexually from one ancestor or stock, to which they are genetically identical."
Banana Guard II says: "How did that happen?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's a long story."
Banana Guard Leader says: "I love long stories."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Aaah!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "There's no time!"
Banana Guard Leader says: "And they're not brothers?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "No!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "They're not brothers, they're clones!"
Finn and Jake are laughing, Princess Bubblegum hears them.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Viginti-quintuplets!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm telling you..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "What are you doing?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Why aren't you helping?"
Jake says: "Come on PBs, just sit here with us for five minutes."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Why?"
Jake says: "Come on!"
Jake says: "Five minutes!"
Princess Bubblegum sits down and sighs. Jake gives her a brick of the wall to eat.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Maybe just a brick."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Hey you, stop!"
Clone James I says: "Yeah?"
Banana Guard Leader says: "Have you seen this guy?"
Clone James I says: "Hmm..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I have to admit, it's fun to watch."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Show them the picture!"
Clone James I says: "Alright."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Have you guys seen this guy?"
Clone James II says: "Hmm..."
III says: "Hmm..."
Three other Jameses come and look at the picture with the others. Princess Bubblegum, Finn and Jake laugh at them while all the left Jameses come and look at the picture.
Banana Guard Leader says: "Let me see that picture again."
Clone James I says: "Here you go."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Hmm..."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Hmm..."
Banana Guard Leader says: "What's your name?"
Clone James I says: "James."
Banana Guard Leader says: "What's your name?"
Clone James IV says: "James."
Clone James V says: "James."
Clone James VI says: "James."
Banana Guard Leader says: "You're all named James."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Is it because you guys look alike?"
Clone James VI says: "I guess so."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Y'know, I was telling this to the guys..."
Banana Guard Leader says: "If, if we look alike, we should have the same name."
Banana Guard Leader says: "It would just make it a little easier."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Life, that is."
Banana Guard Leader says: "It would make our life a little easier."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Same name..."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Look alike..."
Banana Guard Leader says: "You really look alike..."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Brothers!"
Banana Guard Leader says: "You're all brothers?"
Clone James VI says: "No..."
Clone James VI says: "I don't think so."
Clone James VI says: "Twenty-five."
Clone James VI says: "If you're counting how many of us look alike, there's twenty-five."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Hmm..."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Twenty-five..."
Banana Guard Leader says: "Not brothers..."
Banana Guard II says: "Where they'd go?"
The four Banana Guards says: "It's them!"
The four Jameses says: "Whoop whoop!"
The Banana Guards start chasing the Jameses again.
Princess Bubblegum, Finn and Jake are sitting on top of a building and are watching the Jameses building a trap for the Banana Guards. The Banana Guards arrive and are about to enter the trap but it falls apart in front of them. They finally surround the Jameses.
Banana Guards says: "Gotcha!"
Jameses says: "Aww!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "You don't deserve these medals."
James II says: "Wah, no fair."
Gumball Guardian says: "Evil presence detected!"
Gumball Guardian says: "Evil!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Protect the kingdom!"
Banana Guards says: "Okay!"
Banana Guards says: "Weeoo weeoo weeoo weeoo..."
Finn says: "Yoink!"
Banana Guard says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Heeyah!"
Gumball Guardian says: "Evil!"
James II says: "Man, we do deserve them medals."
James II says: "It's not like she can give them to someone else."
James II says: "I wrote my name on all of them."
Clone James says: "Yeah, so did I."
James II says: "Princess!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "The original James?"
James II says: "James are a heroes!"
James II says: "See?"
James II says: "Vrow-w-w-w!"
Clone James says: "Yeah, I'm-a save the day!"
Clone James says: "I, as well!"
Clone James says: "For the good of the many!"
Clone James says: "Check out my selfless act!"
Clone James says: "Me, too!"
Clone James says: "So selfless!"
Clone James says: "All for one, and one for James!"
Jake says: "Mother of Grob!"
Jameses says: "We told you we were heroes!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I hereby award thee..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Jameses..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "These medals for bravery."
Finn says: "Dat's my boi, Jameses!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Now for your new assignment, Jameses."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Go unto the Wastelands, and never come back."
Clone James says: "What-a-wha..."
Clone James says: "?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Do it, and I'll send you a medal every day."
Jameses says: "Yay!"
Clone James says: "Come on, every-James!"
Jameses says: "Medals!"
Jameses says: "Medals!"
Jameses says: "Medals!"
Jameses says: "Medals!"
Jameses says: "Medals!"
