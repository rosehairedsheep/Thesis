The screen starts white, then shows Finn and Jake in snowsuits walking through the heavy snow. Finn looks up, and they see a big fortress made of ice, with green clouds swirling above. Finn and Jake then crawl up the ice, revealing people are frozen inside each block.
Finn says: "Wow, everything sucks here!"
Jake says: "Finn, look!"
Finn says: "Oh jeez, this looks pretty real."
Finn says: "And, wait, is that Billy?"
Finn says: "Why is he so tiny?"
Jake says: "Hey, there's our guy!"
Farmworld/Ice Finn says: "Yeah, just hang out there for a while!"
Farmworld/Ice Finn says: "I love it!"
Farmworld/Ice Finn says: "I feel fresh, hahahahahaha!"
A blue screen appears, with white letters that say "One Hour Ago".
Jake is hanging from the ceiling from his feet, holding Finn's feet. Finn is holding BMO's feet, and BMO is blindfolded and holding a knife. They are spinning in a circular motion.
Finn says: "Round and round and round we go!"
Jake says: "Round and round and round we go!"
BMO says: "Round and round and round we go!"
[BMO hits a poster with his knife. The poster says "Headmaster says: "The Final Lesson", and it shows an angry man in a suit."
BMO says: "Hiya!"
Finn says: "Oh yeah!"
Jake says: "Oh yeah!"
BMO says: "School's out 'ya trench!"
Prismo's pickle jar on the table starts to glow.
Jake says: "Woah!"
Jake says: "Oof!"
Finn says: "Hey, Prismo's calling!"
Jake says: "Nice!"
Jake says: "Let's go say hi."
BMO says: "You're lucky I don't take you out, kid!"
BMO says: "Quit crying baby!"
BMO says: "Oof!"
Finn says: "OOOOOO!"
Jake says: "OOOOOO!"
Finn says: "TION!"
Prismo says: "Thanks for responding to my call, guys!"
Prismo says: "I'm in a serious pickle, and I mean the brown kind."
Prismo says: "I mean like a really smelly, brown pickle."
Jake says: "Don't sweat it, boy!"
Jake says: "Finn and I got yo' back!"
Finn says: "Who's bullying you Prismo?!"
Finn says: "!"
Prismo says: "Nobody's bullying me."
Prismo says: "Look, um, remember when you wished the lich never existed and you created a new wish reality that ended up totally not working out?"
Finn says: "No."
Jake says: "Vaguely, yes."
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "You don't remember making that wish!"
Finn says: "Wu-huh?"
Jake says: "I thought I explained it to you that one time."
Prismo says: "Dude, I'll catch you up."
Prismo says: "After you wished the lich never existed, you accidentally created an alternate wish reality where magic doesn't really exist."
Finn says: "Wait!"
Finn says: "."
Finn says: "Who's that dude?"
Prismo says: "That's you!"
Prismo says: "But sort of less cool."
Finn says: "Uh-huh, proceed."
The recap video shows Farmworld Marceline.
Prismo says: "So you find an old Marceline and the crown on the body of Ice King's skeleton who was smushed under the weight of a frozen mitogenic bomb."
Prismo says: "But then the destiny gang steals your family donkey, so you use the crown to become Ice Finn and save your donkey and your family."
Prismo says: "But, the crown makes you crazy, and you ice everything up like a dumb bozo, which sets off the mitogenic bomb, which releases the spirit of the lich anyway."
Prismo says: "But then, this reality's Jake made a counter wish which supposedly fixed the problem, but as it turned out, it didn't really."
Finn says: "Can I just say that I don't remember any of this stuff."
Prismo says: "Because technically it didn't happen to you."
Prismo says: "But, also it still happened, and that wish reality continues to exist."
Finn says: "Is this why all of a sudden one day I was better at the flute."
Jake says: "Oh yeah, I noticed that!"
Prismo says: "Listen!"
Prismo says: "Something, really bad, is about to go down."
Prismo says: "Ice Finn is using his world's Enchiridion to build a portal to the multiverse."
Prismo says: "I literally do not know what will happen if he succeeds, but it could def's be catastrophic to the architecture of these realities."
Prismo says: "Now if that happens, my boss, let me repeat that, my BOSS will hold ME responsible, and by proxy, y'all both be in the dip too."
Finn says: "Why don't you just bloop bloop it all better?"
Prismo says: "Something there is dampening my powers."
Prismo says: "I AM LOSING MY PICS OVER THIS BIZ!"
Jake says: "His boss!"
Jake says: "Who's that?"
Finn says: "Alright, man, what do we do?"
Prismo says: "Take this, and use it to take care of the Ice Finn."
Prismo says: "Good luck guys we're all depending on you!"
Finn says: "Woah."
Jake says: "What is it?"
Finn says: "Oh golly!"
Jake says: "What's that thing now?"
Finn says: "It's like 50 bowling balls on my teen bod!"
Finn says: "Oh, check it!"
Finn says: "There's instructions."
Jake says: "Lower it!"
Finn says: "Ledge ledge ledge!"
Farmworld/Ice Finn says: "Just a few more jewels before I can open the portal to a better world!"
Finn says: "My intention to heal the madness of this other self."
Jake says: "Wait, wait, wait."
Jake says: "I don't think that's what we're supposed to do."
Jake says: "Prismo said take care of him."
Finn says: "Yeah, that means make him feel better."
Jake says: "Are you being stupid on purpose?"
Finn says: "Yeah, but dude, that is me!"
Finn Sword says: "That's me!"
Jake says: "I heard you the first time!"
Finn says: "There's gotta be something else we can do."
Jake says: "Bro, you heard Prismo, we don't have a choice."
Finn says: "Ok, but you do it!"
Finn says: "I just can't man i- it's too messed up."
Jake says: "Alright, you're right."
Jake says: "Shut your eyes and cover your ears!"
Finn says: "Mamamamamamama."
Jake says: "."
Jake says: "Nope!"
Jake says: "This is bull juice!"
Prismo says: "Oh, flip!"
Jake says: "hey, hey!"
Finn says: "Did you do it?"
Jake says: "Nah man!"
Jake says: "Let's just go steal the Enchiridion."
Finn says: "Woah yeah!"
Finn says: "That way he can't open the portal and nobody gets obliterated!"
Finn says: "That should work!"
Prismo says: "That's not gonna work you guys!"
Prismo says: "Don't walk away from the maid!"
Prismo says: "NOOOOO!"
Farmworld/Ice Finn says: "What's this?"
Farmworld/Ice Finn says: "Oh!"

Jake says: "I'm magic, I can do anything!"
Jake says: "Don't you believe your own eyes?"
Jake says: "Why anything?"
Jake says: "Why's the sky blue, bro?"
Jake says: "That's right, just keep looking at me!"

Shows the ice fortress from the outside, and a big pink beam shoots out of it. Prismo, still watching from the time room, exhales in relief.
