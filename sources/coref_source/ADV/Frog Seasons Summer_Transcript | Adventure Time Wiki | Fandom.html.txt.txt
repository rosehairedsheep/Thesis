The Frog Carrying Crown is walking through the desert. The screen pans out to show an exhausted Finn and Jake following close behind.
Jake says: "Dude, how long are we gonna follow this frog?"
Finn says: "Patience, man."
Finn says: "Something's totally gonna happen."
Jake says: "Ahhh, so hot!"
Water Nymph says: "Yo, Finn and Jake!"
Water Nymph says: "."
Finn says: "Sorry, water nymphs, we've gotta follow that frog."
Finn says: "I just gotta see him put on that crown."
Jake says: "What!"
Jake says: "I thought we were following him back to his treasure hoard."
Finn says: "I ain't in it for the money."
Finn says: "I'm doing it for the sake of discovery..."
Finn says: "and the ladies."
Jake says: "There's no ladies!"
Jake says: "Let's just swim with the water nymphs."
Finn says: "Gotta see it."
Jake says: "Hey, you!"
Jake says: "Frog!"
Jake says: "Look what you're doing to the boy!"
The frog looks back at Finn, then turns away and continues walking.
Jake says: "Put on that crown!"
Finn says: "Ugh, be cool Jake."
Finn says: "What if he puts it on and turns into, like, a beautiful wish dragon?"
The frog lifts the crown above his head. Finn and Jake gasp, but the frog doesn't put the crown on and continues holding it by his side.
Jake says: "THAT'S IT!"
Jake says: "Ha!"
Jake says: "There, you've seen it!"
Jake says: "Now let's- eh, what?"
The frog starts emitting a rumbling sound.
Water Nymph says: "Ah, you've done it now!"
Water Nymph says: "You know the old saying; You can lead a frog to crown, but you can't..."
Water Nymph says: "you can't..."
Water Nymph says: "don't look him in the mouth."
The frog expands into a monster form.
Jake says: "You take off that crown!"
Jake screams as the monster frog approaches, and lifts his gut over them, preparing to crush them.
Water Nymph says: "OHHHHH, he's about to drop a gut!"
Water Nymph says: "Dang!"
The frog picks them up and throws them into his mouth.
Jake says: "I think it's actually cooler in here."
Minisode Ends.
