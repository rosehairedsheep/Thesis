Episode opens at the Breakfast Kingdom.
Breakfast Princess says: "We are delighted to host this year's Princess Day in Breakfast Kingdom!"
Breakfast Princess says: "Please enjoy the continental breakfast expertly prepared by our Breakfast Chefs."
Breakfast Princess says: "Now, on to more pressing matters."
Breakfast Princess says: "Brigands have been attacking our western seaports, dozens of unregistered princesses roam the land, and trade deficits are at an all-time high."
Breakfast Princess says: "Historically, Breakfast Kingdom has traded one sack of sugar a month to Slime Kingdom in exchange for four eggs, but egg production has plummeted!"
Slime Princess says: "I can't just pop out eggs on command!"
Slime Princess says: "I'm an artisan!"
Breakfast Princess says: "You have an egg in you right now."
Slime Princess says: "How dare you?"
Muscle Princess says: "Yeah, and what about that peanut juice, Peanut Princess?"
Muscle Princess says: "My body needs juice!"
Peanut Princess says: "I'm not giving out a single drop of nut butter."
Peanut Princess says: "Not until Raggedy Princess pays me!"
Raggedy Princess says: "Fine!"
Raggedy Princess says: "Take it!"
Raggedy Princess says: "Take all my socks!"
Peanut Princess says: "You still owe me a pair of jorts!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You guys, I'm bored out of my face!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I make a motion to stop talking about dumb stuff that's lame!"
Breakfast Princess says: "Oh, Lumpy Space Princess, I'm afraid you'll have to be patient with us and our petty disputes."
Breakfast Princess says: "Not all of us have achieved the self-sufficiency that I assume you have in your kingdom."
Breakfast Princess says: "Oh wait, that's right."
Breakfast Princess says: "You don't have a kingdom!"
Breakfast Princess says: "You live in a box in the woods."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "It's not a box."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "It's a rotting log."
Breakfast Princess says: "Sorry, LSP, but the chair only recognizes real princesses, not bums."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What?!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm like a cool hippie!"
Breakfast Princess says: "Whatever, freeloader."
Breakfast Princess says: "If you were invited to Princess Day, it must have been a mistake or as a joke."
Breakfast Princess says: "Am I right, girls?"
Strudel Princess says: "Ohh!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "The joke's on you because I wasn't invited."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm crashing!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "And I already ate a bunch of your food!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What you gonna do about it, Princess Egg Breath?"
All says: "Ooh!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "That's true."
Cinnamon Bun says: "She does have egg breath."
Breakfast Princess says: "Okay, you've wasted enough of our time."
Breakfast Princess says: "Guards, take this pamplemousse out of my sight."
Marceline says: "Hmm."
Breakfast Princess says: "Okay."
Breakfast Princess says: "Now that the wannabe's gone, let's get back to princess business."
Breakfast Princess says: "O-Oh, n-not you, Princess Business."
Breakfast Princess says: "Uh, princess business."
Breakfast Princess says: "No, sounds the same."
Breakfast Princess says: "I'm sorry."
Marceline says: "Hey, you want to ditch this jazz?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'd love to, but I'm really invested in this crossword puzzle."
Marceline says: "Figs."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hmm."
Marceline says: "Whoa."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Lousy Breakfast Princess."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Pamplemousse."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What is that even?"
Marceline says: "Yo, LSP."
Marceline says: "Sick tag."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Thanks?"
Marceline says: "You know, I like your vibe, dude."
Marceline says: "You don't take anyone's sass."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Yeah, especially not from that gross pile of greasy hash!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "She lumpin' humiliated me!"
Marceline says: "Listen, let's get even."
Marceline says: "Teach Old Greasy Locks a lesson."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You're bad."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "And I like it!"
Marceline says: "This place smells like butter, bacon, sausage, and juice."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Gonna mess with Breakfast Princess, 'cause she called me pamplemousse."
Marceline says: ""Yobo, Peebocheeks."
Marceline says: "Just kicking down the town with LSP-boos."
Marceline says: "She is acting sooo bad."
Princess Bubblegum says: ""Ha."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Just don't let her get out of control."
Marceline says: ""Too late."
Marceline says: "LSP is really doing it up right now."
Marceline says: "And I'm just feeding the flames."
Princess Bubblegum says: ""Nooooo" exclamation point, exclamation point, exclamation point!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Look."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "There."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Breakfast Princess' room."
Marceline says: "How do you want to get past the Maple Man?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'll show you, hon."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Yeah, look over here!"
Syrup Guard says: "What?"
Marceline says: "Nice distraction."
Both says: "Right on."
Marceline says: "Ugh."
Marceline says: "I can't digest syrup."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "That's for poisoning my girl."
Marceline says: "Stop!"
Marceline says: "Okay, just one more time."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I thought you were bad."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Bad people don't stop."
Marceline says: "Let's don't stop inside."
Both says: "P-p-p-payback!"
Marceline says: "Check it out."
Marceline says: "I hate this album, but I'm taking it anyway."
Syrup Guard #2 says: "Who did this to you, Jerry?"
Jerry says: "I don't know, but they got past me."
Marceline says: "We're busted."
Marceline says: "Turn invisible!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I can't."
Marceline says: "Well,  hide then."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Uh.."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Hide where?"
Syrup Guard #2 says: "I know somebody's in here."
Syrup Guard #2 says: "I-I heard someone say "where."
Syrup Guard #2 says: ""  Oh, smells like grapefruit."
Both says: "Yeah!"
Syrup Guard #2 says: "When I recover my sight, I'm going to imprison you, you giggling girls!"
Syrup Guard #2 says: "Aah!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I got this."
Syrup Guard #2 says: "I don't see them."
Both says: "Hey."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, glob."
Both says: "He's okay!"
Syrup Guard #3 says: "Other Jerry, what happened?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Yeah!"
Marceline says: "Yeah!"
Breakfast Princess says: "Oh, when I mean lunch, I, of course, mean breakfast."
Syrup Guard #4 says: "Your highness."
Syrup Guard #4 says: "There are vandals ruining the castle."
Syrup Guard #4 says: "They are bad."
Breakfast Princess says: "Okay, I'll handle it."
Breakfast Princess says: "Fellow princesses, I got to deal with matters of state."
Breakfast Princess says: "My little sister, Strudel Princess, will take over for me."
Strudel Princess says: "Eat the berries, dip them in the syrup, whoop whoop, want me to show you how?"
Both says: "Whoo!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "A squirrel taught me how to do that."
Marceline says: "That's awesome."
Breakfast Princess says: "Stop right there!"
Marceline says: "Hey!"
Marceline says: "Calm your lumps."
Marceline says: "It'll be okay, dude."
Marceline says: "Girls like us just got to stick together."
Breakfast Princess says: "LSP, is that you?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, glob, no."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Not even."
Breakfast Princess says: "What's this for?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "For digging."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Now start building a sand castle."
Marceline says: "Yeah."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "That was totally fun being bad with you, Marcy."
Marceline says: "Yeah, that was pretty rad."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Do you think, like, doing all that bad stuff makes us..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "like, bad people?"
Marceline says: "Uh..."
Marceline says: "probably not."
Marceline says: "I don't think there are bad people."
Marceline says: "I think good people do bad stuff sometimes, and, oh, that's bad."
Marceline says: "But only if you do it once, it's just a mistake, and..."
Marceline says: "that's not bad."
Marceline says: "I think."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Word."
Marceline says: "But..."
Marceline says: "I mean,  I do think it was wrong to steal this CD."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Yeah, I feel kind of bad about that."
Marceline says: "We should probably mail it back to her."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Yeah."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Good call."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Iâ€”"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh my glob!"
Both says: "Pow!"
Slime Princess says: "Wait, I think I'm ready to pop it."
Strudel Princess says: "Happy Princess Day!"
