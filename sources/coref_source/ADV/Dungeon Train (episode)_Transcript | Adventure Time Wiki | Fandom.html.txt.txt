The episode begins with Finn and Jake walking down a path in a forest.
Finn says: "What..."
Finn says: "is the meaning of "soup"?"
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "I don't know."
Jake says: "What's with all the weird quest—"
Jake says: "?"
Finn says: "What..."
Finn says: "is the meaning of "spoon"?"
Jake says: "Shoot, man, are you still lady-sad about Flame Princess?"
Jake says: "Y'know, it's okay if you are."
Finn says: "Naw, that's all fine."
Finn says: "I just been feeling kind of..."
Finn says: "gray, is all."
Finn says: "Like my inside voice has been kinda quiet lately."
Finn says: "Not a lot of instructions forthcoming, y'know?"
Jake says: "Yeah, well, sounds like you're sad."
Jake says: "Listen, Finn, girls is like horses."
Jake says: "When you fall down, it's important that you get right back on again—"
Jake says: "on a different horse."
Jake says: "And there's a lot of fish in the sea."
Jake says: "A lot of fish."
Jake says: "A penny saved is a penny earned."
Finn says: "Yeah, I-I guess."
Finn says: "Or maybe dating girls is like riding a bicycle."
Jake says: "Yeah, man, yeah!"
Finn says: "Or, like, if you mess up, you could get really hurt forever, or hurt someone you really care about."
Jake says: "Eh, well, I suppose."
Jake says: "Anyway, I hope this mystery cave we're looking for is as weird as Flambo's brother says it is."
Jake says: "Maybe that'll snap you out of the—"
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
He walks up to a train, which is passing by on its tracks.
Jake says: "What's this train all about?"
Jake says: "No one said nothing about no train in the way!"
Finn says: "Relax, buddy."
Finn says: "We'll just cross after it passes."
Finn says: "No big thing, really."
Jake says: "Oh, yeah."
Finn is now sleeping on the ground.
Jake says: "It's two hours later now."
Jake says: "What the stunk?"
Jake says: "Blingle, blongle, blungle!"
A creature comes running toward them screaming.
Creature says: "Gimme!"
Creature says: "Gimme the loot!"
Finn says: "Ow!"
The creature stomps on Finn's toes.
Finn says: "Yeeow!"
Creature says: "Gimme!"
Creature says: "Gimme that hat!"
Finn says: "Knock it off!"
Creature says: "Aah!"
Finn pushes him off the train.
Creature says: "Oh, dang!"
Jake says: "Hey, Finn!"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Look at all the loot that guy dropped while you whipped his butt!"
Finn says: "Dang, look at that sword!"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Pretty fun, huh?"
Finn says: "Yeah, man!"
Finn says: "It's spicy baby fun!"
Jake says: "You wanna go see what other kind of monsters are on this train?"
Finn says: "Yes!"
They enter a different car of the train, where some blue ants await, holding loot in each hand.
Finn says: "Whoa, Crystal Ants, I think!"
They enter another car, where some rock monsters moan and walk toward them.
Finn says: "Ha-ha!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Scene changes to Finn fighting several monsters in quick succession. The last one explodes, getting some of its goo on Jake.
Jake says: "Welcome back, buddy."
Finn says: "Man, look at all this rad loot!"
Jake says: "Yeah, this is a pretty neat train."
Jake says: "We should come back again someday."
Finn says: "Whoa, what do you mean?"
Finn says: "We just started only, like, three hours ago."
Jake says: "Heheh, yeah."
Jake says: "I'm just gettin' a little bored, is all."
Jake says: "All these cars of monsters are kinda all the same."
Jake says: "It's a little boring."
Finn says: "Oh, come on."
Finn says: "Come on!"
Jake says: "All right, just one more."
Finn says: "Ha-ha, yes!"
They enter another car, but this one appears empty.
Finn says: "Hmm?"
Finn says: "Where is everybody?"
Jake says: "Hey, hey!"
Jake says: "Empty car—"
Jake says: "think we beat it, buddy."
A door opens behind them, out of which comes a chubby green monster with a crown that shoot fires.
Finn says: "Whoa, man!"
Finn says: "Boss battle!"
Finn says: "Let's chew it up!"
Jake says: "Okay, but this is the last one, okay?"
Finn says: "We'll see!"
The monster trips Finn and blasts fire at him, singeing his hat.
Finn says: "Ha-ha!"
Jake says: "Hey, man,  you remember we were going to that weird cave?"
Jake says: "Bet it's not too late to check it out."
Finn says: "Eh, weird cave, weird train—"
Finn says: "I'm cool here."
Jake says: "Okay."
Finn says: "Hyah!"
A head grows out of the monster underneath its crown.
Head says: "Ahhhh, gimme a break!"
The monster disappears in a flash of light and drops loot.
Finn says: "Oh?"
Finn says: "Oh, dang."
Finn says: "Boss loot!"
Jake picks up the rest of the loot and tries on a glove, which makes him chubby and green like the monster. He quickly takes it off, throws it on the ground, and kicks it away.
Jake says: "No, thank you."
Finn says: "Jake, hurry."
Finn says: "Next car!"
They enter the next car, which contains green jelly creatures.
Finn says: "Slime crimes!"
Jake says: "You have fun."
Jake says: "I'm just gonna watch."
Finn says: "Hey."
A monster squirts some green liquid at Finn, hitting the back of his leg.
Finn says: "Ow!"
Finn says: "Ow."
Finn says: "Cool..."
Finn says: "acid!"
The monster squirts again, but Finn picks up the shield and reflects it back at it, killing it. Finn walks over to the loot it dropped. Jake's stomach rumbles.
Jake says: "Hey, also, man, aren't you, like, gettin' kinda hungry?"
Finn says: "Yeah, man."
Finn says: "I guess we've been here for a while."
Jake says: "More than a while, dude."
Jake says: "I've already missed my bathroom window!"
Finn says: "Yeah, I guess I could take a snack break."
Jake says: "'Kay!"
Jake says: "Well, we'll go back to the tree house, and I'll make us some lunch."
Jake says: "I could make the toaster pancakes you like."
Finn kills a monster, which drops some meat.
Jake says: "And maybe I can boil up some hot dogs, or—"
Jake says: "Aah!"
Finn says: "Hot meat!"
The scene changes to Finn entering another car, in which red ants await.
Jake says: "Ants again?"
Finn says: ""Ant" no thang!"
Jake says: "Dude, this is the ant car."
Jake says: "We already did the ant car."
Jake says: "We did all the ants!"
Finn says: "Same car,  but those were blue ants."
Finn says: "These are red ants."
Jake says: "Finn, I think we should take off."
Jake says: "I think this place is bad news for you."
Finn says: "Man, no way."
Finn says: "All this feels good."
Finn says: "Ah!"
Finn says: "Like when you made those biscuits way back?"
Finn says: "And I kept eating them until they were all gone."
Finn says: "Like that!"
Jake says: "Finn,  I made those biscuits with so much butter."
Jake says: "You were just responding to the butter!"
Jake says: "This whole place is butter!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
A door opens, out of which comes the second boss.
Finn says: "Boss fight!"
The monster raises its wand and blasts Finn backwards.
Blasts from the monster's wand zoom by Jake, who is sitting in a corner. He picks up a pair of pants that one of the ants dropped and puts them on. Finn grunts and an explosion sounds.
Boss says: "My jacket-sta!"
Finn says: "Check it out: battle moon."
A small moons orbits around his head. A crystal ball rolls toward Jake.
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "This is a future crystal!"
Jake says: "Look!"
In the sphere is Finn in full armor, battling yellow Crystal Ants.
Jake says: "That's you, dude!"
Jake says: "You're old, you're alone, and you're still fighting on this dumb train!"
Future Finn says: "Get "ant" of town."
Finn says: "Whoa."
Finn says: "I'm gonna have the best life!"
Jake gapes.
Scene cuts to them entering another car. Jake kicks the wall, and some Hair Apes shoot lightning at Finn, who blocks it with his shield.
Finn says: "Oh, Hair Apes!"
Jake says: "Nuh-uh, dude."
Jake says: "I'm bored, I'm tired, and I'm goin' back to the tree house."
Jake says: "You can come with me if you want."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "No, man!"
Finn says: "It's better on the train; stuff makes sense here."
Finn says: "Yow!"
Jake says: "I'm sorry."
Jake says: "If you wish to join me, I'll be in the tree house experiencing the joys of life and not getting attacked by gorillas made out of hair."
Finn says: "You'll be back."
Jake says: "No, I won't, Finn."
Jake says: "Goodbye!"
He makes it sound like he's getting farther away by making his face smaller. He looks back in at Finn.
A Hair Ape shoots some lightning at Finn, but his battle moon blocks it.
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: ""Hair" we go!"
Jake says: "What're you doin' up here?"
Jake says: "Are you gettin' sick of things down there, too?"
Jake says: "Mm-hmm."
He takes off his pack, and the Hair Ape pats his leg invitingly.
Jake says: "You're not gonna try and zap me, are you?"
The Hair Ape shrugs. Jake rests his head on the Hair Ape's leg and looks up at the stars.
Jake says: "I wonder what my kids are doin'."
Morning arrives, and Jake hears the Hair Ape rubbing his hands together to zap him.
Jake says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "I knew it!"
He hits the Hair Ape, which disappears in a flurry of hair. He then picks up his pack, puts on his hat, and picks up the Hair Ape's hat.
Jake says: "Umm..."
Jake says: "hey, there, friend."
Jake says: "I ain't lookin' for no trouble."
Jake says: "Just lookin' for my friend, Finn."
Jake says: "Maybe you seen him?"
Jake says: "About five feet tall, picks his nose, and always kinda smells funny l—"
Finn says: "Hey, hey!"
Finn says: "Jake, it's me!"
Finn says: "I'm just all souped up now."
Jake says: "Ah, jeez, Finn."
Jake says: "I..."
Jake says: "for a minute there, I thought you were one of those twisted-lost-soul boss guys."
Finn says: "Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl."
Jake says: "Wait, you are!"
Jake says: "You are one!"
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Those guys are cool!"
Jake says: "That's it, man!"
Jake says: "I'm gettin' you off this train whether you like it or not!"
Finn says: "Jake, stay back."
Finn says: "I mean it!"
Jake says: "Oh, please."
Jake says: "What're you gonna do?"
Jake says: "I'm ten times stronger than—"
Finn squirts a large amount of silk at him with his spider wand.
Jake says: "Ah, gross!"
Finn says: "Jake?"
Finn says: "All those years—"
Finn says: "he stayed with me."
Future Jake says: "Finn, can we slow down?"
Future Jake says: "My feet hurt."
Future Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Oh, Jake."
Finn says: "Hang in there, buddy."
Finn says: "I'ma set this right."
He gets up, and his battle moon falls. He makes his way toward Jake, taking off his helmet on the way.
Jake says: "Finn?"
Jake says: "Finn, I'm sorry."
Jake says: "I'll stay on the train with you, I swear."
Jake says: "Just get this stuff off of me."
Finn says: "No, I'm sorry, Jake."
Finn says: "I messed up, but don't worry."
Finn says: "It's all over now."
Jake says: "You mean we're gettin' off the train?"
Finn says: "Well..."
Finn says: "you are."
Finn says: "I'm gonna keep playin' for a while."
Finn says: "I'll meet you back home in a week or two."
Jake says: "Aw, man, don't you see that's just the train talkin'?"
Jake says: "It's got its hooks in you!"
Finn says: "see for yourself."
The crystal displays Finn and Jake washing dishes at the Tree Fort.
Jake says: "Yeah, man."
Jake says: "That's what I'm talkin' about."
Jake says: "That..."
Jake says: "is what I'm talkin' about."
Episode ends.
