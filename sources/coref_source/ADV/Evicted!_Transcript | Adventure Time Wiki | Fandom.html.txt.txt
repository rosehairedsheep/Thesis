The scene begins at the Tree Fort.
Jake says: "And as it waded through the carnage that it had wrought, the vampire smashed their skulls just for the fun of it!"
Finn says: "No way!"
Jake says: "Yes way, it did."
Jake says: "And also the vampire hunched over its victims and breathed their vaporized blood mist."
Finn says: "Ah, jeez!"
Finn says: "Jake, is this stuff you're saying true?"
Finn says: "Or are you just trying to mess me up?"
Finn says: "You have to be honest."
Jake says: "Oh, it's true, man."
Jake says: "I heard it through a reliable source."
Finn says: "Reliable?"
Finn says: "Rats!"
Jake says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "Some say it haunted this very tree!"
Finn says: "This tree?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Good niiiight..."
Finn says: "Jake?"
Jake warbling downstairs.
Finn says: "You're full of it, Jake!"
Jake warbling ominously.
Finn says: "Errr..."
Sees a tree limb tapping on his window, then a mysterious figure taps on the window.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "AAAAAH!!!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "I saw someone outside the window!"
Jake says: "Relax, buddy."
Jake says: "I made that story up."
Jake says: "I was just trying to scare you."
Finn says: "But you said you heard it from a reliable source!"
Jake says: "Ha ha!"
Jake says: "I made that up, too."
Jake says: "I was trying to scare you, and it worked!"
Finn says: "No one's outside."
Jake says: "Whew!"
Finn says: "It was just the wind, scaredy-cat."
Jake says: "I wasn't scared, I was singing."
Jake says: "I was singing my scream song."
Jake says: "Ahh!"
Jake says: "Ahh!"
Jake says: "AAaah-uh-aah!"
Finn says: "You're a total wuss, man."
Marceline says: "Hey, guys."
Marceline says: "What's up?"
Marceline says: "I'm Marceline the Vampire Queen."
Finn says: "Are you gonna smash my skull and breathe my blood mist?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Don't suck our blood!"
Finn says: "Soooo, you don't suck blood?"
Marceline says: "Sometimes, I do."
Marceline says: "But it's not the blood that I like."
Marceline says: "It's the color."
Marceline says: "I eat shades of red."
Sucks the red out of a strawberry, and gives it to Finn.
Marceline says: "Ugh, I am exhausted."
Marceline says: "I've been traveling all over the Land of Ooo."
Marceline says: "And I've seen some stuff that would really make you say "like what?"
Finn says: "Like what?"
Marceline says: "I encountered a school of goldfish beasts."
Marceline says: "And I fooled around in the Fire Kingdom."
Finn says: "OOO!"
Marceline says: "Oh, and check these out."
Finn says: "Nuts?"
Marceline says: "Oh, these aren't ordinary nuts."
Finn says: "You're wonderful."
Jake says: "Um, yeah."
Jake says: "Thank you for not sucking our blood."
Marceline says: "You guys seem cool, too, but as you can imagine, I'm really tired, so you two should probably get going."
Finn says: "What?"
Marceline says: ""M" for "Marceline."
Jake says: "Aw, man."
Marceline says: "I carved in this tree years ago."
Marceline says: "Way before you two rascals started squatting here."
Marceline says: "But seriously guys, thanks for keeping the place warm for me, I mean really great!"
Shuts the door.
Marceline says: "Good night!"
Jake says: "Come on, Finn."
Jake says: "Let's get out of here."
Finn says: "She can't kick us out of our house!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Finn says: "Get down here, lady, and fight me!"
Jake says: "She's a vampire, dude!"
Marceline sucks the red out of a crumpet, and throws it onto Finn.
Finn says: "I'm gonna kill her."
Jake says: "Dude, if half the stories I've heard, and/or made up are true, vampires will kill you."
Jake says: "There's no question!"
Marceline hisses at them and then walks away, laughing.
Finn says: "But, what about our home?"
Jake says: "A VAMPIRE TOOK IT!"
Jake says: "Aw, we should go house-hunting."
Jake says: "Bag us a new house."
Finn says: "But I like our home."
Jake says: "Finn, house-hunting is wild!"
Jake says: "You've got to try it."
Finn says: "Really?"
Jake says: "Yeah, man!"
Jake says: "It is so nuts!"
Finn says: "You always know what to say."
Jake says: "Bla-bla-bla-ble-ble-bla-bloo-bloop!"
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "I'm convinced."
Finn says: "Let's roll!"
Jake says: "Sweet, things are gonna start going our way."
Jake says: "Hey, look, see?"
Jake says: "What'd I tell ya?"
House Hunting Song begins.
Finn says: "This is weak!"
Finn says: "I don't even like any of these places."
Finn says: "I wanna go home."
Jake says: "Finn, let me tell you a little something about what home really means."
Jake says: "Home isn't a place, let me give you a clue..."
Jake says: "Home is anywhere, where people care about you..."
Finn says: "I don't wanna hear a lecture, dude!"
Finn says: "I just wanna go home..."
Finn says: "Yeah, I guess I'd rather be out here, wrapped in your ear, than be in some awesome house all by my..."
Finn says: "souse."
Jake says: "I'd rather be dancing with some babes!"
Finn says: "Shut up, dude!"
Jake says: "Ew..."
Jake says: "Gross."
Jake says: "This place looks gross!"
Finn says: "And abandoned."
Finn says: "Whoa, bro..."
Finn says: "Wanna just live in here?"
Jake says: "Yes."
Jake says: "So whaddaya think, man?"
Jake says: "We did pretty good for ourselves."
Finn says: "Yeah, we did..."
Finn says: "So, ah, what should we do first with our new digs?"
Jake says: "Let's trash it and throw a party!"
Finn says: "Ah this is it, feelin' good, I'm feelin', I'm feelin' like we did it."
Finn says: "I'm feelin', like, completely satisfied."
Finn says: "Nothin' else could go wrong, ya know, Jake?"
Jake says: "Yeah, man."
Finn says: "Aww, yeah, I know, too."
Marceline says: "Hey, Finn."
Jake says: "She's back!"
Marceline says: "Wow, pretty awesome party ya got here."
Finn says: "What do you want, Marceline?!"
Finn says: "!"
Marceline says: "Oh, I just wanna show you somethin'."
Marceline says: "This cave belongs to me!"
Finn says: "What!"
Finn says: "?"
Marceline says: "Thanks for fixing the place up for me."
Finn says: "Y-You can't take our home twice!"
Marceline says: "Yes, I caaaannnnnn!"
Finn says: "AAAAAAAHHHH!"
Finn says: "It's vampire-fighting time!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "Nooo!"
Jake says: "Vampires will kill you..."
Jake says: "remember!"
Jake says: "?"
Finn says: "But she's taking our home again!"
Jake says: "We're home as long as we're together, bla-bla-bleep-bla-bloop, remember!"
Jake says: "?"
Finn says: "Oh, yeah."
Finn says: "Okay, Marceline, I'm gonna let you keep this cave, but only because Jake is my home, and he's way better than all your homes combined!"
Marceline says: "Ya know, you're right."
Marceline says: "I guess I'll take him too!"
Finn says: "What!"
Finn says: "?"
Marceline says: "I'll bite him a little, maybe turn him into a zombie."
Jake says: "Nooo!"
Finn says: "Let go of Jake!"
Marceline says: "Make me."
Finn slaps Jake out of Marceline's grip.
Finn says: "You okay, pal?"
Marceline says: "No one..."
Marceline says: "makes me..."
Marceline says: "let go..."
Marceline says: "of Jake!"
Finn says: "I'm not scared of you!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Marceline says: "You're pathetic, little boy!"
Finn says: "Get ready for an uppercut, you dog!"
Marceline says: "Make me."
Marceline says: "Bleh-bleh!"
Marceline says: "Blah!"
Jake says: "I've..."
Jake says: "gotta help my buddy."
Marceline says: "Your blood is mine!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "Uh oh."
Marceline sucks Jake's blood and throws Jake's remains on the ground; she laughs.
Marceline says: "Ow!"
Marceline says: "That actually hurt, Finn."
Finn says: "Why didn't you just kill me?"
Marceline says: "'Cuz that was fun!"
Marceline says: "I haven't fought like that in years!"
Marceline says: "Thanks, Finn."
Jake says: "Finn!"
Finn says: "Aren't you dead?"
Jake says: "Naaah, before she bit me I used my powers to shrink all my guts and blood over my thumb, see?"
Marceline says: "You two are pretty hardcore."
Marceline says: "I can appreciate that."
Finn says: "Soooo so does that mean we can have our old house back?"
Marceline says: "Yeah!"
Marceline says: "Keep it, as a gift from me."
Marceline says: "Blaeargh!"
Finn and Jake both run away screaming.
Scene cuts back to the tree fort.
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Did you guys get on the bed?"
Finn says: "I told you, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED!"
King Worm says: "Oh, hey, guys."
King Worm says: "Come here, friends..."
King Worm says: "Hug me..."
King Worm says: "wawawawawawawa..."
King Worm says: "Aw, yeah, hug me..."
King Worm says: "wawawawawawawawa..."
