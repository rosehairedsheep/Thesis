Episode opens to Tree Fort with Finn and Jake singing Prismo's Ritual in the background.
Finn says: "♪Fallen ally, fallen ally, home now in the sky."
Jake says: "♪Fallen ally, fallen ally, home now in the sky."
Finn says: "Fallen ally, fallen ally, a single tear we cry."
Jake says: "Fallen ally, fallen ally, a single tear we cry."
Finn says: "♪A truer friend, there was none."
Finn says: "♪ And Prismo was his name."
Jake says: "♪ And Prismo was his name."
Jake says: "♪An artisan of pickling, and now just one remains."
Jake says: "♪And now just one♪—"
Jake says: "I can't do this, man!"
Jake says: "I-it just can't be over!"
Finn says: "Hey..."
Finn says: "We can put it back in the fridge, if you want."
Jake says: "No, these picks were made by our friend to be mouth-loved!"
Jake walks over to the pickle jar while making kissing noises, then suddenly stops.
Jake says: "We have to honor his memory with a final taste of his genius."
Jake says: "Get ready for the dream ritual."
Finn bangs gong, they start humming and then burst into dance.
Finn says: "Prismo we love you forever in our dreams!"
Jake says: "Prismo we love you forever in our dreams!"
Finn and Jake start chanting.
Finn says: "Pickle rama, pickle rama, pickle rama, PICKLE RAMA!"
Jake says: "Pickle rama, pickle rama, pickle rama, PICKLE RAMA!"
Jake says: "Finale!"
Jake stretches into a large ball shape and juggles food items with several hands while they hum. Jake stretches his tongue down to the pickle in the jar, and eats it. A blast of light explodes from the jar.
Finn says: "Whoof!"
Finn says: "What was that?"
Jake says: "Quick, to bed!"
Jake says: "This has to be the last thing we think about!"
Jake grabs the jar, and they run off to bed.
Finn says: "Hyup!"
Jake says: "Okay..."
Jake says: "dream!"
Screen fades to black, cut to Tree Fort at day time.
Finn says: "Whoo!"
Finn says: "Crazy dream, man."
Finn says: "Prismo was definitely in it, but—"
Finn says: "Jake?"
Scene cuts to Jake's bed, with only the pickle jar in it.
Finn says: "You up already?"
Finn walks to window, sees Jake re-enacting the burial of the Everything burrito.
Finn says: "What the..."
Jake says: "I love you, Everything Burrito."
Finn says: "Jake, why are you pretending to dig up Everything Burrito?"
Jake says: "Huh, what?"
Finn says: "Hold on, I'm coming down."
Jake explodes into dust, Finn comes running out of the Tree Fort.
Finn says: "Jake, you gotta hear my dream, I—"
Finn says: "Jake?"
Jake says: "Hey, man, you're shaking it all wrong!"
Finn says: "What the jump?"
Jake says: "Shh."
Jake says: "Let me show you how.."
Jake says: "it's..."
Jake says: "done!"
Music starts playing, and Jake dances.
Finn says: "Jake, are you sleepwalking?"
Jake says: "No, I'm showing this—"
Jake says: "Whoaaaa!"
Finn screams.
Finn says: "Wake!"
Finn says: "Tunk..."
Finn says: "I'm not dreaming!"
Jake says: "You made an oath."
Jake says: "Okay."
Finn screams, turns to look at Jake.
Jake says: "Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree."
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "I saw you explode."
Finn says: "Something messed up is haps, bruh."
Jake says: "Pshhh."
Jake says: "Please, not even."
Finn says: "No, man, you blew into chunks over there!"
Jake says: "Uh, because Kee-Oth was right there!"
Jake says: "A-and there were traps!"
Jake says: "I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it."
Jake says: "Uuuuuhhh..."
Finn says: "Jake, this already happened."
Finn says: "Ugh, Jake dust!"
Scene cuts to kitchen where Jake is re-enacting making pancakes.
Jake says: "♪ Bacon pancaaake!"
Finn says: "Dude, what is the deal?"
Scene cuts to various sections of the Time Room.
Jake says: "Dude, what is the deal?"
Jake's path ends at the scene where the Lich kills Old Man Prismo.
Jake says: "The Lich?!"
Jake says: "!"
The Lich says: "Wake up."
The Lich shakes old man Prismo awake.
Prismo says: "Wa—"
Prismo says: "Wait, I've changed my mind—"
Prismo is off from the walls—his dream self dies.
Jake says: "Wait, why is this happening?"
Jake says: "It's like a rerun of the worst junk."
The Lich kills old man Prismo and is subsequently crystallized by a Citadel Guardian and is taken away with Finn and Past Jake holding on.
Jake says: "Lich life-sucks Prismo's dream host, eliminates Prismo forever."
Jake says: "Ugh, it's mad gris bro."
Jake says: "And then the Space Police, or whatever they're called, show up because boppin' Prismo is a cosmic crime."
Jake says: "I remember feelin' like someone had peeled a layer away from my brain, and my reality was no longer anchored to any point of reference, and I had to fight to keep from being crushed under the weight of an unforgiving new paradigm of ultimate reality."
Jake says: "So cool, man."
Jake says: "So why am I seeing this again?"
Jake makes his way from the ledge to the edge of the space hole.
The Time Room disassembles, several blocks at a time and then a path appears in front of Jake.
Jake says: "Uhhh, that's cool..."
Scene jumps back to a bored Finn at the Tree Fort.
Jake says: "Uhh, that's cool, but do you know what's really cool?"
Jake says: "Tough guy contest!"
Jake says: "Tough boys!"
Jake says: "Come on, man!"
Jake says: "Tough Guy contest me!"
Finn says: "but as soon as I break their history it creates a paradox and Jake explodes."
Jake says: "Finn, when I die my individual Earth consciousness is going to go all over everywhere while Glob tallies my deeds."
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "I'm going to all around you , in your nose, in your dreams and your socks..."
Finn says: ""in your dreams?"
Jake says: "Yeah, that's what I said, in your dre—"
Finn says: "All this striz happened when Jake and I tried to preserve Prismo's pickles in our dreams, something must have changed when we went to sleep!"
Finn says: "So, ugh, I just got to hope that Jake tries to do the pickle ritual again."
Finn says: "So I can re-enact it with him."
Finn says: "Exactly the way it happened, maybe?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Geez!"
Jake says: "♪ Fallen ally, fallen ally, you're home now in the sky."
Finn says: "♪ Fallen ally, fallen ally, a single tear we cry."
Jake says: "♪ Fallen ally, fallen ally, a single tear we cry."
Scene jumps back to the Time Room.
Jake says: "I guess I'm headed towards that door.."
Prismo says: "Dude, I get out of relationships because I don't want to have a discussion about what we're gonna to have for dinner every night!"
Prismo says: "'Cause when I'm alone..."
Jake says: "Hehe, all these dudes and their lady problems..."
Prismo says: "That's right, Prismo is nothing but the dream of a wrinkly old man."
Jake says: "What if the whole world was just some goof's dream?"
Jake says: "Man, that would be stupid."
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Camera pans out to reveal that Jake has entered a large room with a floating bed in an alcove on the far side.
Jake says: "Rrrm, wait a minute..."
Jake says: "What is this!"
Jake says: "?"
Jake says: "This couldn't be a..."
Jake says: "oh Grod!"
Jake says: "Glass of milk..."
Jake says: "This feels like a trap designed by some kind of sick genius!"
Jake says: "Well..."
Jake says: "hats off to you sir or madam, your trap was a success!"
Jake says: "Oh my blahs!"
Prismo says: "Oh, dang, I'm back!"
Finn says: "♪ Prismo we love you forever in our dreams!"
Jake says: "♪ Prismo we love you forever in our dreams!"
Finn and Jake start chanting.
Finn says: "Pickle rama, pickle rama, pickle rama, PICKLE RAMA!"
Jake says: "Pickle rama, pickle rama, pickle rama, PICKLE RAMA!"
Jake says: "Finale!"
Jake stretches into a large ball shape and mimes juggling food items with several hands while they hum. Jake stretches his tongue down to the table there is no jar, and mimes eating a pickle.
Finn says: "Whoof!"
Finn says: "What was that?"
Jake says: "Quick, to bed!"
Jake says: "This has to be the last thing we think about!"
Jake mimes grabbing the jar, and they run off to bed. Jake picks up the pickle jar in his bed.
Finn says: "Hyup!"
Jake says: "Okay..."
Jake says: "dream!"
A ding is heard and a bright light from the pickle jar shines out and Jake disappears.
Finn materializes in the Time Room.
Finn says: "Whoa..."
Finn says: "Where the heck am I?"
Jake says: "Wait up, man, how're you alive!"
Jake says: "?"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "?"
Finn says: "I'm coming man!"
Jake says: "Finn and I saw your old man host body get destroyed by the—"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Don't explode!"
Prismo says: "Finn, hold up."
Finn says: "Prismo!"
Finn says: "I saw you die, dude!"
Prismo says: "Yep, I'm still dead."
Prismo says: "I'm actually talking to you from the past, I set up this plan B scenario in case I ever got croaked for reals."
Prismo says: "So if this is happening then I guess I got croaked and my pickles ran out."
Prismo says: "But Jake and I established a bro-bond that could bring me back through his dreams."
Finn says: "So, are you actually talking to me right now or are you pretending to in an empty room?"
Prismo says: "I was pretending, but now I can see you."
Finn says: "What does 'now' meant to you?"
Prismo says: "Uhhh..."
Jake says: "Where you going bro?"
Jake says: "Wait up man, how're you alive?"
Finn says: "So where're we going?"
Prismo says: "You've gotta wake up Jake and then..."
Prismo says: "umm, you'll see."
Finn says: "I'll see what, Prismo?"
Prismo says: "Shoot, I don't know if I thought this thing all the way through.."
Finn says: "Whaaaat?"
Prismo says: "Aw, it'll be cool."
Prismo says: "It'll be cool."
Jake snores while sleeping in the bed.
Revived Prismo says: "Dude, I can't believe I died."
Revived Prismo says: "Jake I'm sorry man."
Revived Prismo says: "This doesn't feel right."
Revived Prismo says: "Whoa, Finn, hey, are you gonna wake up Jake?"
Finn says: "Yeah, is that gonna kill you again though?"
Revived Prismo says: "My past self is doing plan B right?"
Finn says: "Uh, yes."
Finn says: "Although I gotta say that this is as rickety as yoga balls."
Revived Prismo says: "Yeah, tell me about it."
Finn says: "You tell you about it!"
Revived Prismo says: "I think you would blow up if I did that."
Finn says: "Well, anyway, here I go."
Finn says: "Hey, Jake, wake up."
Jake groans sleepily.
Revived Prismo says: "I'm out."
Jake says: "Hey, Finn, what's going on?"
Finn says: "We gotta bounce."
Jake says: "I'm okay now."
Finn says: "Cool  this way!"
Past Jake says: "Whoa!"
Past Jake says: "Rrrm, wait a minute..."
Past Jake says: "What is this!"
Past Jake says: "?"
Jake says: "Prismo?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "You're alive!"
Prismo says: "Well, not yet."
Prismo says: "Finn, in a second you've gotta stop yourself from waking up Jake."
Finn says: "Stop my who?"
Prismo says: "Shoot!"
Prismo says: "Hide!"
Jake flattens himself and covers Finn into the wall, fortunately Jake is the same color as the wall.
Past Finn says: "Think we should turn around somewhere, I feel like we're lost."
Past Prismo says: "No I was just stalling, don't think about it, c'mon, this way."
Prismo says: "THAT who."
Finn pushes his extended tongue back into his mouth.
Prismo says: "But wait, Jake, that means one of your alternate reality incarnations will sleep for eternity to keep me alive."
Jake says: "Cool, dude!"
Prismo says: "OK, Finn, I'm not sure what'll happen if you confront yourself."
Prismo says: "He might explode."
Finn says: "'He', me or other me?"
Prismo says: "You know what?"
Prismo says: "Forget it."
Finn says: "Shut it Prismo, heroes risk everything for their friends."
Finn says: "Although I admit you're more Jake's friend than mine."
Finn says: "Sometimes you can think someone is totally cool, but you never become besties."
Finn says: "Now I don't know why that happens, but regardless let's do this."
Prismo says: "Good luck!"
Past Finn walks up the bed to revive Jake.
Revived Prismo says: "Whoa, Finn, hey!"
Revived Prismo says: "Are you gonna wake up Jake?"
Past Finn says: "Yeah, is that gonna kill you again though?"
Prismo says: "My past self is doing plan B, right?"
Finn says: "PLAN B!"
Finn says: "This is me?"
Finn says: "This sword is me?"
Prismo says: "Finn sword, dude."
Finn says: "Welcome back, Prismo."
Prismo says: "Thank you, Finn."
Jake says: "Welcome back, Prismo."
Prismo says: "Thank you, Jake."
Sleeping Jake morphs into Old Man Prismo.
