The episode begins with Ice King flying with Princess Bubblegum, cackling deviously.
Finn says: "Hey, fart-face!!"
Ice King says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Unhand Princess Bubblegum!!"
Ice King says: "Foolish interlopers!"
Ice King says: "Zah!"
Finn says: "Ah!"
Ice King says: "Ee hee hee hee—"
Ice King says: "OOH!"
Ice King says: "MY EYESIGHT!"
Jake forms his posterior into Princess Bubblegum's shape while Finn puts two rocks on it, representing her eyes. He replaces Princess Bubblegum with his posterior without Ice King noticing.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Huh?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hee hee hee!"
Finn says: "Hey, Ice King!"
Finn says: "I bet you'll never kiss the princess!"
Ice King says: "I will kiss her!"
Ice King says: "I will!"
Ice King says: "Mwah!"
Finn says: "You just kissed Jake's butt!"
Ice King says: "What?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Ice King says: "The hour is yours, but the day shall be mine!"
Ice King says: "Just like you, Princess—"
Ice King says: "MINE!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "What a patoot."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Thanks for saving the day yet again, boys."
Finn says: "You're welcome, Princess."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm gonna throw you two a party."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Meet at the Candy Kingdom—"
Princess Bubblegum says: "TONIGHT!"
The three cheer. "PARTY TIME" logo pops up and balloons fill up the screen to shift to the next scene. Finn and Jake are walking to the Candy Castle through the Cotton Candy Forest.
Jake says: "That paper crane for Princess Bubblegum?"
Finn says: "I just thought I'd bring 'er a gift..."
Finn says: "in return for throwing us this party."
Jake says: "Heh."
Jake says: "I bet you wish you were my butt."
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "I bet you wish you were my butt, because then the princess would..."
Jake says: "No, wait..."
Jake says: "I bet you wish you were the Ice King and the princess was my butt!"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Hmm..."
Jake says: "OH!"
Jake says: "I bet you wish Bubblegum would kiss you, too!"
Jake says: "Like the Ice King and my butt!"
Jake says: "Hahahaha!"
Finn says: "That's ridiculous!"
Finn says: "What's so funny?"
Hard cut to the Candy Castle.
Peppermint Butler says: "Hey, everybody."
Peppermint Butler says: "Finn and Jake are here."
Jake says: "Who's ready to party?!"
Jake says: "!"
The crowd seems focused on and gathered around something else. Finn and Jake confusedly look at each other.
Finn says: "What's everyone laughing at?"
Wildberry Princess says: "Shh!"
Ricardio says: "Stand back, everyone."
Ricardio says: "This style of massage is called, "Best Friend Massage."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, my gosh..."
Ricardio says: "Because it can only be done for friends."
Ricardio says: "It is completely consensual."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, holy cow..."
Ricardio says: "Relax yourself now, Lumpy Space Princess..."
Ricardio says: "YAH!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I feel so great!"
Finn says: "Who is that guy?"
Ricardio says: "Hahaaa!"
Jake shrugs. A fanfare is heard and Princess Bubblegum enters.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Greetings, party-goers!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Glad you could all make it!"
Finn says: "Princess Bubblegum!"
Finn says: "Princess."
Finn says: "I just wanted to thank you for—"
Finn says: "Uhhh..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "This is..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, my gosh."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I don't even know your name."
Ricardio says: "Ricardio."
Ricardio says: "Ricardio at your service."
Ricardio says: "I've been waiting all evening to meet you, Princess."
Ricardio says: "I've heard you appreciate ancient technology."
Ricardio says: "Have you ever used the balbaflonic laser to align the hybernotalist rift in the bubaflon plasmodial formation?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Whoa!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "No, I haven't!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Wanna continue this conversation on the dance floor?"
Ricardio says: "It would be my pleasure, Princess."
Finn says: "Why didn't the princess invite me to dance?"
Jake says: "If you wanna dance, just go dance!"
Finn says: "But now she's dancing with him!"
Finn says: "Ah..."
Finn says: "I feel..."
Finn says: "weird!"
Jake says: "Huh, it sounds like you're dealing with some new emotions you don't understand..."
Jake says: "like jealousy."
Finn says: "BLAAAARGH!!"
Jake says: "Look, man, just go out there and get down!"
Ricardio says: "—"
Ricardio says: "transmordial layers completely independent of the babylons."
Ricardio says: "Eh?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Wow!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "That would mean that the babylons would fluctuate with the piranha-nanosphere!"
Ricardio says: "Correct!"
Finn says: "Agh!"
Finn says: "They're talkin' about science, man!"
Finn says: "I can't compete with that!"
Jake says: "Do the Science Dance!"
Jake says: "Remember it?"
Jake says: "It was sorta like this."
Jake says: "Wah unh we ah eeh..."
Finn says: "You think that'll work?"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Probably."
Jake says: "Do it, man!"
Jake says: "You're a pro!"
Finn says: "Science Dance!"
Finn says: "Science Dance!"
Ricardio says: "—"
Ricardio says: "lower proximities to—"
Finn says: "Science Dance!"
Finn says: "Hey, eh, Princess!"
Finn says: "You wanna spend some time with me?"
Ricardio says: "Excuse me, Princess."
Ricardio says: "You must excuse me."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, uh..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Alright!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn, what the cabbage?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I was learning about Zanoits!"
Finn says: "Oh..."
Finn says: "I'm..."
Finn says: "into Zanoits!"
Finn says: "Th-They're the best!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Zanoits kill hundreds of thousands of Plantoids a year."
Finn says: "Oh, no, not the Plantoids!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Plantoids produce mellotoxin!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Mellotoxin kills Zanoits!!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "So are Zanoits..."
Finn says: "good things?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "You're totally jealous of Ricardio."
Finn says: "No, I'm not."
Finn says: "I just don't like the way he talks to you."
Finn says: "It makes me feel weird."
Princess Bubblegum says: "That's jealousy, hun."
Finn says: "I'm not jealous!"
Finn says: "I'M WEIRD!!!"
The party notices Finn's scene.
Jake says: "Wow, man, what happened out there?"
Finn says: "Agh..."
Finn says: "I don't know!"
Finn says: "I was tryin' to warn 'er, but she twisted my words around and—"
Jake says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "Ladies are twisty, man."
Jake says: "Bubblegum's super smart, too."
Finn says: "I know!"
Finn says: "And I can't shake this weird feeling about Ricardio."
Finn says: "I think he's..."
Finn says: "a villain."
Jake says: "Why?"
Jake says: "Is it because his face is so foldy and dramatic?"
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "I can just feel it in my gut!"
Finn says: "He's up to something sinister!"
Jake says: "Maybe what you feel is romantic rivalry."
Finn says: "I'll prove he's a villain!"
Jake says: "How?"
Finn says: "Stakeout."
Scene shifts to outside in the Candy Kingdom. Finn and Jake are on a roof, and Finn is looking through binoculars.
Finn says: "Here he comes!"
Finn says: "They're talking!"
Jake says: "Lemme see."
Jake says: ""You look kind of like a big pink baguette!"
Finn says: "Get serious, Jake!!"
Finn says: "This is life and death!"
Jake says: "Is it?"
Jake says: "Don't get me wrong."
Jake says: "I'm all about stakeouts and spying on this guy, but what if he's not a villain?"
Jake says: "What if he just looks wicked?"
Jake says: "Some people look wicked but are super nice."
Finn says: "I gotta trust my gut!"
Jake says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "He's on the move!"
Finn says: "Let's roll!"
Finn says: "I see 'im."
Finn says: "He's holding rope and going into the trash."
Finn says: "He's smashing bottles—"
Finn says: "and pretending to stab someone!"
Jake says: "So..."
Jake says: "he's recycling..."
Jake says: "or what?"
Finn says: "Ricardio is tossing him in the dumpster and running away!"
Jake says: "So I was right!"
Jake says: "He is a good guy who's just cursed to look suspicious!"
Jake says: "You and me, gut!"
Jake says: "Together forever!"
Jake says: "Solvin' crimes and makin' up rhymes!"
Finn says: "No way."
Finn says: "This proves he's a super-villain!"
Finn says: "More powerful than lesser villains like the Ice King!"
Jake sings the Gut Song.
Finn says: "Then it's settled!"
Finn says: "We're gonna confront Ricardio face-to-face and prove he's evil!"
Jake says: "Or good!"
Scene cuts to downtown in the Candy Kingdom. Ricardio walks deviously and accidentally runs into Finn.
Ricardio says: "Oof!"
Finn says: "So what're you doin', Ricardio?"
Finn says: "Are you evil?"
Jake says: "Or nice with an evil face?"
Ricardio says: "That's none of your business."
Finn says: "The safety of Princess Bubblegum is my business!"
Jake says: "Yeah, we just wanna know if you're evil or not."
Ricardio says: "Oh, yeah?"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "Yeah."
Ricardio says: "Oh, yeah?"
Jake says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "Yes!"
Finn says: "You stay away from Princess Bubblegum with all that stuff!"
Ricardio says: "Now that my plan is nearly complete, there is no way you could stop me."
Finn says: "I could stop you if I wanted!"
Ricardio says: "Oh, yeah?"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Ricardio says: "Oh, yeah??"
Finn says: "YEEEAAAH!!!"
Finn punches Ricardio, knocking him down. Princess Bubblegum enters.
Princess Bubblegum says: "What's going on here?"
Finn says: "Princess?!"
Finn says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Ricardio?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Ricardio says: "Yes..."
Ricardio says: "I'm alright, Princess."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "why'd you do it?"
Finn says: "He was gonna hurt you with those ropes and bottles!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "These were for our balbaflonic laser."
Ricardio says: "It's not all his fault, Princess."
Ricardio says: "I might've looked a little threatening."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "you shouldn't punch brainiacs."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You know how fragile they are!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "You gotta stop this jealous business."
Finn says: "But..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "C'mon, Ricardio."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'll patch you up and give you candy."
Finn says: "She hates me now."
Finn says: "I was totally wrong about Ricardio."
Ice King says: "No, Finn!"
Finn says: "Ice King!"
Finn says: "What do you know about this?"
Finn says: "Tell me or I'll do something!"
Jake says: "Hold up, Finn!"
Jake says: "The Ice King looks sorta damaged!"
Finn says: "I don't care!"
Finn says: "I only care about Ricardio!"
Ice King says: "But my enervated condition has everything to do with him."
Ice King says: "Stop Ricardio!"
Finn says: "Gotta save the princess!"
They enter.
Jake says: "Princess Bubblegum!!"
Finn says: "Princess!!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn!!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Jake!!"
She is tied up in the rope from earlier and Ricardio is next to her with the broken bottle in his hand.
Ricardio says: "You were right all along, Finn!"
Ricardio says: "Now I'm going to cut out Princess Bubblegum's heart and make out with it!"
Finn says: "Not if I can help it!"
They chase Ricardio, and Ricardio ends up next to Bubblegum again.
Ricardio says: "One step closer and I'll remove her heart!!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I feel like a big idiot for doubting you!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "He was just so engaging!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "But his knowledge on plantoids is actually pretty weak."
Ricardio says: "Shut your mouth up, Princess!"
Ricardio says: "I'm gonna smooch that heart!!"
Ricardio says: "It will be my bride!!"
Finn says: "Why don't you marry someone your own size?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Like my foot?!"
Finn says: "!"
Ricardio says: "Huh?!"
Ricardio says: "!"
Finn kicks him.
Finn says: "And my fist?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn punches him twice.
Ice King says: "Stop!"
Ice King says: "Stop it!"
Ice King says: "That's my heart, you piece of—"
Finn says: "Ice King."
Finn says: "Should we..."
Finn says: "let 'im take his heart back?"
Finn says: "He is..."
Finn says: "villainous..."
Jake says: "I don't wanna watch an old man die on Princess Bubblegum's carpet, man."
Ice King says: "Oh, yeah..."
Ricardio says: "Wait!"
Ricardio says: "Wait!"
Ricardio says: "No!"
Ice King says: "Come to daddy..."
Ricardio says: "Noooooooooo!"
Ice King says: "Yeah, there you go..."
Ice King says: "Like that?"
Ice King says: "Huh?"
Ricardio says: "Seeee you guys laterrrr..."
Ice King says: "I feel wonderful!"
Ice King says: "Hahaha!"
Ice King says: "And now that I've saved the Princess, she'll marry me and live in my dungeon every day!"
Finn says: "No, she won't!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yeah, no, I won't!"
Ice King says: "Yes you WILL!"
Scene cuts to a dining room in the castle. Finn, Jake, and Bubblegum are eating spaghetti.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Thanks again for saving me..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "again."
Finn says: "Don't mention it."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Now that Ricardio's gone, you don't have to be jealous of anyone anymore."
Finn says: "I never get jealous."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Am I doing it right, Jake?"
Jake chuckles.
Finn says: "NOOOOOOOO!!!"
Iris out.
