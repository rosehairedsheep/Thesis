Turtle Princess says: "Hi, guys!"
Finn says: "'Sup, Turtle Princess?"
Jake says: "'Sup, Turtle Princess?"

Lumpy Space Princess says: "Agh!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Agh!"

Turtle Princess says: "Huh..."
Turtle Princess says: "it must be nice."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Nah."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "It's horrible."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "They just want me for my lumps!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Aren't you sick of men going after your turtle lumps?"
Turtle Princess says: "Actually, I've never been able to work my T-lumps."
Turtle Princess says: "I just know what I read in books."
Turtle Princess says: "Hey!"
Turtle Princess says: "You should write a book telling me how to do it!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, my Glob!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Turtle Princess!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I've always wanted to write trashy books for ladies!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Yeah, everyone needs to know when I work these lumps, no man is immune to their influence!"
Two balls land in front of them. Finn enters.
Finn says: "Jake's ball landed over here, BMO!"
Turtle Princess says: "LSP!"
Turtle Princess says: "Finn would be perfect as the test subject for your lump studies!"
BMO and Jake enter.
BMO says: "Yay!"
BMO says: "I win!"
BMO says: "Bow to your sensei!"
Jake says: "Aaah..."
Finn says: "Heh heh heh heh heh heh!"
Turtle Princess says: "You gotta go undercover and conduct your lump science on him."
Turtle Princess says: "Prove to the world that even a white knight like Finn is no match for the power of your lumps!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'll do it!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "For the world!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "And for you, girl!"
Turtle Princess says: "Oh, girl!"
They both smile. Lumpy Space Princess grabs a plastic grocery bag off the ground and dons it like a spaghetti-strap dress. Scene shifts to the Grasslands; Lumpy Space Princess is going to the Tree Fort.

Lumpy Space Princess says: "It's down in there."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Okay, wait, I got it."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Uh, here you go."
Finn says: "Smells like fruit pie."
Jake says: "It's nice of you to wanna be our secretary..."
Jake says: "but we don't need one."
Finn says: "Dude, look at 'er."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Mmm..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, Glob..."
Finn says: "Yeah, it's sad."
Finn says: "Come on."

Jake hesitates speaking for a moment.
Jake says: "Alright, LSP."
Jake says: "Come inside."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Awesome."
The three walk inside.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm gonna need a secretary desk!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm starving!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What's for dinner?!"

Scene shifts to the next morning. Lumpy Space Princess wakes up grunting and drooling.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What's that?"
Lumpy Space Princess goes outside to find Finn putting rocks in Jake.
Jake says: "'Sup, LSP?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What're you guys doing?"
Finn says: "We're carrying these rocks on an adventure, up to the Mystery Mountains."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, nuh-uh, I am not gonna carry rocks!"
Finn says: "That's okay."
Finn says: "Jake can carry 'em."
Jake says: "Yup."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Ugh..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Fine..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You're welcome, Finn."
Finn gives a thumbs up. The trio starts going to the mountains.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Ugh..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "My arms weren't meant to carry so many rocks, you guys!"
Finn says: "C'mon, LSP."
Finn says: "You can make it."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Uuoohhh..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Turtle Princess, you can't call me!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You're gonna blow my cover!"
Turtle Princess says: "Good morning, girl."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Good morning, girl."
Turtle Princess says: "Would you be mad at me if I ask out Billy, that vulture who was hitting on you?"
Turtle Princess says: "I think he's cute and I would—"
Finn says: "Hey, LSP, shake a leg."
The trio arrives at the top of one of the mountains.
Finn says: "The Loch of Phantoms."
Finn says: "Princess Bubblegum said the rocks would show us the safe path."
Finn says: "Haha!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: ""Ker-ploop."
Jake says: "Heh heh heh!"
Jake says: ""Ker-ploop."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Not..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "gotcha?"
Finn throws another rock in the lake, and the rock stays on the lake's surface.
Finn says: "Alright!"
Finn throws a bunch more rocks in to determine which path to walk in. The trio enters the cave opposite them. Sludge falls on Lumpy Space Princess.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Ugh!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "This place is plops, Finn!"
Finn says: "We can meetcha back at the tree house later if you want."
Finn says: "That weird light..."
The trio eventually stops in front of a strange vortex.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Hey, Finn!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Finn, my dress is slipping!!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Listen, LSP, we've gotta be carefu—"
She drifts into the portal.
Finn says: "No, LSP!"
Finn says: "It's not safe!"
Lumpy Space Princess gets trapped in a room full of mirrors.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Heeeeeeey..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Hey, Fiiiiinn..."
Finn and Jake bang on the wall.
Finn says: "She's stuck in there!"
Jake says: "We gotta bust through this wall!"
They attack the wall.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I knew you couldn't resist me, Finn."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Aah!"
Finn and Jake finish defeating the shadow Finns and pant heavily.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "That was so crazy!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What just happened?!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "!"
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Uh, Bubblegum sent us on a quest to destroy these cursed mirrors."
Finn says: "Evil stuff happens when you look into them."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, Glob..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I had to look because I looked so good!"
Finn says: "LSP..."
Finn says: "you don't need a mirror to know you look good."
Finn says: "You're beautiful on the inside."
Finn says: "Like..."
Finn says: "your brain and stuff!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Thanks for sayin' that stuff..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "and for saving me from those mirror-yous."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "That was pretty nice."
Finn smiles. Scene shifts back to the Tree Fort.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Okay."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Time to write."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Gonna make this..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "trashy."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Turtle Princess'll be all,  What's he doing out there?"
Jake says: "Sometimes, after an adventure, he likes to sit out there and think."
Lumpy Space Princess looks at Finn. Her cellphone rings "Heeey, girl! He—" and she answers.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Hello?"
Turtle Princess says: "Hey, girl."
Turtle Princess says: "Are you almost done with your book?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm working on it!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I've been doing so much research!"
Turtle Princess says: "Did Finn fall victim to your lumps?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Um..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "yeah..."
Turtle Princess says: "Great!"
Turtle Princess says: "Bring in your manuscript right away!"
Turtle Princess says: "Click!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "HE'S GREAT!"
Lumpy Space Princess begins typing a new manuscript. As she's typing, it begins to rain, and Finn runs inside. In response, Lumpy Space Princess hurriedly gathers up her manuscript and leaves as Finn enters.
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "Bye, LSP."
Scene cuts to the Library. Turtle Princess reads the manuscript confused.
Turtle Princess says: "This isn't what you said it'd be about..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I know, I—"
Turtle Princess says: "I LOVE IT!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "OH, MY GLOB!"
Turtle Princess makes the cover and titles the book "I Wrote a Book." Billy screeches. Back at the Tree Fort, the rain clears, and Lumpy Space Princess returns.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Finn!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You've probably been wondering where I've been for the last few hours!"
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Yeah, I have."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Finn..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I was never really your secretary, Finn."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I was writing a book about how you were a slave to my lumps because I'm so hot, Finn!!"
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Okay."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "But you're the one who's hot, Finn!!"
Finn says: "Wow."
Finn says: "Uh, thanks!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "No..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "thank you."
Jake says: "LSP, YOU'RE WEARING GARBAGE FOR CLOTHES!!!!"
