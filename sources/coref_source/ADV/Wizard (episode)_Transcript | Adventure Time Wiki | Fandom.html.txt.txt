The episode begins with Finn and Jake walking through the Grass Lands.
Finn says: "Hey, Jake."
Jake says: "Yeah?"
Finn says: "You ever wonder what a demon's heart looks like?"
Jake says: "Of course, dude."
Finn says: "You ever wonder what a demon's heart tastes like?"
Reaper says: "Hey, kid..."
Reaper says: "You want some magic powers..."
Reaper says: "?"
Reaper says: "Magic powers for absolutely free..."
Finn says: "Heck yeah!"
Jake says: "Check out the sunken, lifeless eyes..."
Jake says: "The foul stench of decay..."
Jake says: "You know what that means?"
Finn says: "Means he's evil, I guess."
Jake says: "Well, evil, sure..."
Jake says: "but mostly, he's unattractive, and unattractive people are desperate."
Jake says: "You should haggle with him!"
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "I want more than just free powers!"
Finn says: "What else ya got?!"
Finn says: "!"
Reaper says: "Alright..."
Reaper says: "Free magical powers and..."
Reaper says: "Eh!"
Reaper says: "And this keychain."
Finn says: "OH!"
Finn says: "OH!"
Finn says: "OH!"
Jake says: "Play it cool, Finn."
Finn says: "Right."
Finn says: "I begrudgingly accept your offer."
Storm clouds begin to cluster above the reaper.
Reaper says: "This way..."
The Adventure Time logo spins onto the screen. The sword goes through the logo. The scene shifts to a realm in which there is a wizard training facility. Finn and Jake fall from the portal and land here.
Finn says: "This place looks magical."
Finn says: "You think this is where we get the powers?"
Door opens.
Host says: "Yes, I do."
Host says: "Free powers for all."
Host says: "Want some?"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Are you the guy handing 'em out?"
Host says: "You seek Bufo, the wizard!"
Finn says: "So, where's that guy?"
Host says: "He is here, of course."
Finn says: "Uh..."
Jake says: "He's here..."
Jake says: "but he's not you."
Host says: "That's right."
Jake says: "We should beat 'im up until he starts makin' sense!"
The host shrinks in fear and expands his neck. Tadpoles emerge.
Bufo says: "We are Bufo!"
Finn says: "Ohhhh..."
Bufo says: "Dang it, Leonard!!"
Bufo says: "If we don't talk at the same time, nobody can understand us!"
Tadpole says: "Sorry..."
Tadpole says: "geez..."
Bufo says: "these!"
Finn says: "Hahaha!"
Jake says: "Hahaha!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "We want 'em!"
Jake says: "We want 'em!"
Finn says: "Give us the stuff!"
Jake says: "Give us the stuff!"
Jake says: "Oh, boy!"
Finn says: "Yes, we do!"
Finn says: "Can't wait!"
Bufo says: "Then follow..."
Bufo says: "."
Finn and Jake enthusiastically follow.
Finn says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Jake says: "Whoo!"
Bufo says: "Behold the Grand Hall of Wizardry!"
Bufo says: "This is where young potentials train to become Ultimate Wizards!"
Bufo says: "Most are not ready for the responsibility that comes with it."
Finn says: "I'm responsible, dude!"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "So am I!"
Finn says: "That's a lie!"
Jake says: "It is a lie..."
Jake says: "and I take full responsibility for it!"
Bufo says: "Yes, yes..."
Bufo says: "very responsible."
Bufo says: "Now I bestow upon you these wizard cloaks!"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Whoa!"
They don the cloaks.
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "This is a dress!"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "And I am into it!"
Jake says: "It's, like, gossamer!"
Finn says: "This way I won't be embarrassed!"
Bufo says: "Fine, fine."
Bufo says: "Now for every power that you accrue,  This final star betokens the rank of Ultimate Wizard!"
Finn and Jake gasp in awe.
Finn says: "Mark me, Jake."
Finn says: "I shall have that final star!"
Finn says: "Where do we start?!"
Finn says: "!"
Bufo says: "Level 1—"
Bufo says: "Dustomancy."
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Dustomancy!"
Finn says: "Whatever that is!"
Finn says: "Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme!"
Bufo says: "To receive this power, you must first..."
Bufo says: "eat these brooms."
He gives the brooms to Finn and Jake.
Finn says: "Alright."
Finn says: "This is gross!!"
Finn says: "Man, I can't eat this!"
Jake says: "Yeah, you can!"
Jake says: "Do what I do!"
Jake says: "RAAAAWR!!"
Jake says: "Ah, there we go."
A star forms on Jake's cloak. Finn and Jake make amazed noises.
Finn says: "Whoooaaa!"
Finn says: "You got a star!"
Jake says: "Haha!"
Jake says: "Observe my magics!"
Finn says: "Wait, Jake!"
Finn says: "Don't use 'em until I finish my broom!"
A star appears on Finn's cloak.
Jake says: "Dude, you got your star, too!"
Finn says: "Nothing happened!"
Finn says: "This is a total ripoff!!"
Finn says: "Bufo!"
Finn says: "You tricked us!"
Finn says: "Stupid power doesn't even work!!"
Bufo says: "Calm yourself, boy."
Bufo says: "You are acting hysterical."
Bufo says: "Do you not see that you are using Dustomancy?"
Bufo says: "Behold..."
A dust mote appears.
Finn says: "I'm doing this?"
Finn says: "So..."
Finn says: "I have—"
Bufo says: "Yes."
Bufo says: "Mastery over all dust motes."
Bufo says: "You can also read their emotions."
Bufo says: "For instance, this mote is very unhappy in his marriage."
Jake says: "Well, that's..."
Jake says: "sorta cool."
Finn says: ""Sorta" cool?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "?"
Finn says: "THIS IS RADICAL!"
Jake says: "Whoo, yeah!"
Jake says: "Force that enthusiasm!"
Bufo says: "Are you ready for more magic?"
Finn says: "We get more?!"
Finn says: "!"
Bufo says: "So much more..."
Bufo says: "like Level 2..."
Bufo says: "the power of..."
Bufo says: "Shadowcery!"
Bufo says: "You can't see through those, right?"
Finn says: "Nope..."
Finn says: "Not at all."
Bufo says: "To gain provenance over the shadows, place your hands into  this bowl!"
Jake says: "What bowl?"
Bufo says: "No!"
Bufo says: "Cover your eyes!"
Jake says: "Mmmm, fine..."
Bufo says: "Thrust your hands into this bowl..."
Bufo says: "of eyeballs."
Finn says: "Eyeballs?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Dude, it's okay."
Jake says: "They're just peeled grapes."
Bufo says: "No!"
Bufo says: "They're eyeballs..."
Bufo says: "Well done."
Bufo says: "You have groped the eyeballs fearlessly."
Finn and Jake each get a new star on their cloaks.
Finn says: "Another star!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Shadowcery..."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Shadow Horse says: "No touchies."
Finn says: "Wizard powers are so cool..."
Finn says: "I want ALL THE STAR BADGES!!!"
A montage begins. On Level 3, Finn and Jake must balance pencils on their lips.
Bufo says: "Excellent."
Finn and Jake are rewarded with their third stars and the power of hair creation. Jake chuckles and makes himself a mustache. On Level 8, Finn and Jake spin coins by flicking them. Stars are rewarded.
Bufo says: "Well done."
Finn and Jake are rewarded with the power of mayonnaise creation. They feed themselves with mayonnaise. On the next challenge, Finn flips a hammer and is rewarded with a star; on the succeeding challenge, Jake puts an orange slice in his mouth to create a fake smile and is rewarded with a star. On the next challenge, Finn and Jake both balance themselves on tilted chairs. On Level 15, Jake is rewarded with Beauteous Wings. On Level 27, Finn is rewarded with the Vorpal Hand. On Level 31, Finn and Jake are granted the power of firework creation. They laugh and cheer as they blast fireworks into the night sky. The montage ends.
Finn says: "All we're missing now is the big star!"
Finn says: "You ready to complete the set, man?"
Jake says: "Nah, I'm good."
Finn says: "WHAT?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "How can you stop now??"
Jake says: "Eh..."
Jake says: "I've got everything I need."
Jake says: "A limitless supply of mayonnaise, this captivating new hairstyle..."
Jake says: "and I just learned the best spell of all!"
Finn says: "What's that?"
Jake says: "Sleep."
Jake makes himself fall asleep by shooting himself with the spell.
Finn says: "Aw..."
Finn says: "What a lame-o."
Finn says: "Bufo!"
Finn says: "I'm ready to get that big star!"
Bufo says: "To tell true, the last power is not free."
Finn says: "Wha??"
Finn says: "You can't do this to me, man!"
Finn says: "I've got no money!"
Bufo says: "No, no cash."
Bufo says: "For the final star, you must take the pledge of ultimate responsibility."
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "I'll take that pledge."
Bufo says: "Are you sure?"
Bufo says: "Perhaps you are not sufficiently familiar with—"
Finn says: "I'm ready!"
Bufo says: "Well, there may be ramifications that you cannot—"
Finn says: "Just let me take that pledge, man!"
Bufo says: "My word, I've never met someone so irresponsibly responsible."
Bufo says: "Very well, then."
Bufo says: "You must..."
Bufo says: "grasp my hand."
Finn says: "That's it?"
Finn says: "My big star!!"
Finn says: "Yes!!"
Finn says: "Wha-hoo!"
Finn says: "Yeah!!"
Finn says: "Wait, where am I?"
Bufo says: "Direct your attention to the scale-model orb."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Is that an asteroid heading for this very temple?"
Bufo says: "Yes."
Bufo says: "It's been heading for this temple for 847 years."
Bufo says: "Only the magic of the ultimate wizards keeps it from getting any closer."
Bufo says: "Quickly, add your power to that of the orb."
Finn says: "Oh, okay."
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "I got it!"
Finn says: "Now what?"
Bufo says: "Now I release the elder Jeremy from his pledge."
Bufo says: "Razzamafoo!"
Jeremy says: "It's about time..."
Bufo says: "And you take his place..."
Bufo says: "for the rest of your natural life."
Finn says: "Awesome."
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Wait, what?!"
Finn says: "!"
Bufo says: "This is what you signed up for when you took the pledge of ultimate responsibility."
Finn says: "This is what all the wizard training was about?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "You tricked me!"
Old Wizard says: "Young wizard!"
Old Wizard says: "The asteroid approaches!"
Finn says: "Oh, yeah."
Finn says: "Sorry."
Bufo says: "I tricked you, of course..."
Bufo says: "but would anyone really volunteer to do this?"
Finn says: "Aw, man, this sucks."
Finn says: "Old people!"
Finn says: "There's gotta be a better way!"
Old Wizard says: "Nope..."
Old Wizard says: "This is how the ancient ones wanted it."
Finn says: "Yeah?"
Finn says: "I've got a younger idea!"
Old Wizard says: "You fool!"
Old Wizard says: "Your newfangled thinking will get us all killed!"
Finn says: "Youth culture forever!"
Finn says: "Whoa."
Bufo seems to be putting Jeremy in a coffin while he is still alive.
Bufo says: "Hey!"
Bufo says: "Have you gone crazy?!"
Bufo says: "!"
Bufo says: "Get back in the bouncy harness!"
Finn says: "Sleep!"
Bufo says: "You are—"
Bufo says: "!"
Bufo says: "Uhh..."
Finn runs up and readies himself.
Finn says: "Ultimate Wizardry, activate!"
The spell hits a rock, and it becomes animate.
Rock says: "Hey, I'm alive!"
Rock says: "What's that up there?"
Rock says: "AH!"
Rock says: "OH, NO!"
Finn says: "Hah..."
Finn says: "My stupid young idea will be responsible for hundreds of deaths!"
Old Wizard says: "It sure will!"
Finn turns at his voice.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Old wizards!"
Finn says: "You ditched your responsibilities to help me!"
Old Wizard says: "What?"
Old Wizard says: "No!"
Old Wizard says: "We left so we wouldn't be killed by that asteroid!"
Finn says: "Oh, okay, um, since you're here already, could you lend me a hand??"
The Old Wizards and Finn all use their Ultimate Magical Hands to move the village out of the meteor's path. When the meteor lands, a giant explosion occurs, destroying the clothes of the Old Wizards, Finn, and Jake. Jake wakes up.
Jake says: "Huh??"
The village falls back down, as do Finn and the Old Wizards.
Finn says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Finn says: "Nice job!"
Finn says: "Thanks to us, the village is saved."
Finn says: "And we reclaimed a few of your twilight years!"
Bufo says: "Don't forget to thank me."
Bufo says: "For this was my plan for all of these 847 years."
Finn says: "No way!"
Finn says: "Your plan was to dupe a succession of rubes into keeping the asteroid at bay!"
Bufo says: "My life is oveeeeeer!"
Finn says: "Chill, man."
Finn says: "You don't have to quit your job."
Bufo says: "I don't?"
Finn says: "Nah."
Finn says: "Just don't take credit for ideas that aren't yours."
Bufo says: "Oh..."
Bufo says: "okay..."
Bufo says: "Glad I thought of it..."
Finn and Jake are walking.
Reaper says: "Hey, naked kid."
Reaper says: "you want some free..."
Reaper says: "Demon heart?!"
Reaper says: "!"
Finn says: "Aw, ha ha ha haw, yeah!"
Jake says: "Full circle!!"
The episode ends.
