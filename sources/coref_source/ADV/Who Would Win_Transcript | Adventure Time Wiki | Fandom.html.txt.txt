The episode opens with Finn and Jake standing at the edge of a large canyon.
Jake says: "What'cha think?"
Finn says: "I can make that driz, no problem."
Jake says: "It's crazy far, man."
Finn says: "Naw, that's just a perspectal illusion."
Finn says: "It looks far 'cause the cliff's lower."
Jake says: "Eh, go for it."
Finn backs up, runs, and jumps into the canyon, making it about halfway across.
Finn says: "Whoo!"
Finn says: "Shoot!"
Jake stretches arms to catch him and pulls him back up.
Finn says: "Almost."
Jake says: "Not really."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Watch me, fool!"
Finn says: "Hup."
Finn says: "WAAAAAAH!"
Jake jumps down after him, grabs onto Finn's back, and shapeshifts like a flying squirrel. They fly out of the canyon and continue gliding.
Finn says: "I did it!"
Finn says: "Psych."
Finn says: "Hey, you know what?"
Finn says: "This is cool, just having bro time for once."
Jake says: "What, like, no ladies?"
Finn says: "Or dudes, or whatevs."
Finn says: "It's just a chore sometimes."
Jake says: "Yeah, two people is mad efficient."
They fly towards a lake with a barn half-submerged in the middle. Dozens of Marauders are climbing on it and yelling.
Finn says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "It's a beach brawl!"
Finn says: "Looks like they're trying to drown a barn."
Jake says: "That's not a barn."
Jake says: "That's a dude!"
The Farm lifts his head and punches the water, sending Marauders washing up on the shore. Finn and Jake land nearby.
Finn says: "Holy fizzle!"
Finn says: "What is that huge dude?"
Marauder says: "He's the Farm, the legendary fighter of the Shiney Isles."
Marauder says: "I came here to participate in his open challenge, but this mother can't be beat!"
The Farm says: "Give up, worms!"
The Farm says: "My fight power is supreme!"
Marauders says: "Train, Train, Train, Train!"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
The Train is shown on a nearby cliff.
Marauder #1 says: "I love you, the Train!"
Marauder #2 says: "You're almost as legendary as the Farm, the Train!"
The Train says: "The Train is gonna smack you down on his tracks!"
The Train says: "Whoop!"
The Train says: "Choo-choo."
The Train says: "Choo-choo!"
Finn says: "Oh, my Glob."
The Train says: "Choooo!"
The Farm sits down on the Train and stands back up.
The Train says: "Ow."
The Train says: "My legs are backwards!"
The Train says: "Oh!"
Finn says: "Did you just die?"
The Train says: "No..."
The Train says: "the Train will chug on."
The Train says: "My friend makes bionic legs."
The Train says: "I'll be better than before."
Finn says: "I want bionic legs!"
Finn says: "Who's your friend?"
The Train says: "Yeah, right."
The Train says: "It's secret!"
Jake says: "You don't want bionic legs."
Jake says: "It ain't natchy."
Finn says: "I don't care about natchy."
Jake says: "Let's discuss this later."
Various beaten-up Marauders groan.
The Farm says: "You guys wanna fight me?"
Finn says: "You think we can beat him?"
Jake says: "Yeah way, we can't!"
Jake says: "He's the ultimate!"
Finn says: "But if we beat him, we'll be crazy legends."
Jake says: "Man, I already am a legend in other aspects of life."
Jake says: "Third highest score in Kompy's Kastle, bro."
Jake says: "Third..."
Jake says: "in the Candy Kingdom."
Finn says: "Jake, that's your legend."
Finn says: "This could be our legend."
Finn says: "Brogend!"
Jake says: "Okay."
Jake says: "How are we gonna beat him, then?"
Finn says: "Train!"
Jake says: "He can't even walk."
Finn says: "No, man, train up, like, get ripped!"
Jake says: "Yeah, I was just kiddin'."
Jake says: "Let's destroy that guy!"
Finn says: "We're comin' back for you, the Farm!"
Finn says: "After we train!"
The Farm says: "Yeah, that's cool."
Finn says: "We're gonna annihilate you, the Farm!"
The Farm says: "Mm'kay."
Finn says: "I'm gonna do a finishing move on you!"
Finn says: "Alright!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "C'mon, Jake!"
Montage begins with Finn doing the splits. Jake does them easily and continues stretching. Next, Finn does double dutch with Jake's stretched arm as Jake picks his nose. Then, Finn punches the air as Jake does a somersault.
Finn says: "Hyah!"
Finn says: "Hyah!"
Jake says: "Let's see your Chokey Brokey Style!"
Finn performs the move on Jake.
Jake says: "Nice one."
Finn says: "Yes!"
Jake says: "Now watch my..."
Jake says: "Something Style."
Jake's punches become weaker until they do not even connect.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Video game music plays as Jake continues weakly punching in Finn's direction. Finn looks behind Jake and sees that Jake stretched his eyes to the back of his head and is playing a game.
Finn says: "Jake, you're playing Kompy's Kastle?"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Whoo!"
Jake says: "Uh..."
Jake says: "yes."
Finn says: "Winning this battle could take our reputation to a whole new level!"
Jake says: "Look, I'm a full-grown dog of my own, and I need to play Kompy's Kastle every day so I can maintain my rank."
Finn says: "So, you don't care about fighting the Farm?"
Jake says: "I never really take anything seriously..."
Jake says: "'cept Kompy's Kastle."
Finn says: "Hi-yah!"
Jake says: "KOMPYYYYY!"
Kompy appears behind the cracked screen alongside the words "Jake I've always had a crush on you." Then the screen goes black, and it starts to rain.
Jake says: "I'm gonna break every bone in your body, then heal you later with that magical goo we got from the Cyclops' eye!"
Finn says: "Ouch."
Jake says: "Apologize!"
Jake says: "I'm gonna turn up the juice!"
Jake says: "My little face!"
Finn climbs up Jake's arm, grabs onto Jake's eyeball, and starts smacking it. Jake brings his hand in, but Finn climbs on top of Jake's head, causing Jake to squish his own eye.
Jake says: "Ouch!"
Jake says: "Where are ya?"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Apologize for not taking training seriously!"
Jake punches Finn, knocking him down. Jake tries to kick him, but misses. Finn runs into a fallen hollow tree.
Jake says: "Come out, you chicken nug!"
Finn says: "Huh!"
Jake says: "Ow."
Finn keeps running as Jake tries to punch him. Finn falls into a hole in the tree and gets stuck. The tree is revealed to be bridging the canyon as Finn struggles to get out. Jake stretches past him and forms a row of dozens of feet on the bottom of his body. He then begins stretching backwards over Finn, as each foot kicks him in the face.
Jake says: "Apologize to Kompy's Kastle!"
Finn says: "No."
Finn says: "You apologize for not taking training seriously."
Jake grows huge, breaking the fallen tree and causing the two to fall. In midair, Finn hawks a loogie and spits in Jake's face.
Jake says: "Ehh, gross!"
Finn kicks Jake, who hits the ground first. Finn then falls on top of Jake and rolls away. The tree then falls on Jake.
Jake stretches out from underneath the tree, walks toward Finn, and tries to punch him. Finn grabs Jake's wrist and twists it repeatedly, turning it red.
Jake says: "Ow!"
Finn throws mud in Jake's eyes.
Jake says: "AAH!"
Jake says: "My eyes!"
Jake says: "Cheap move, you butt rag!"
Finn says: "You!"
Finn says: "You're the cheap move!"
Jake pulls down Finn's pants.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Pants!"
Finn says: "Huh!"
Jake says: "Oh!"
Finn says: "I'm really gonna wipe you now."
Jake says: "OUCH!"
Jake says: "Ow!"
Jake says: "O-o-o-ow!"
Jake says: "No bities!"
Finn says: "I'm gonna down the Farm without you."
Jake says: "I'm gonna knock down the Farm just so you'll never know the taste of downing the Farm!"
Scene changes to the lake, where the Farm is sleeping.
Finn says: "Yo, guess what?"
Finn says: "Guess what, homey?"
Finn says: "I put in the time."
Finn says: "I'ma make you mine."
The Farm wakes up and walks toward them.
Finn says: "Yeah, that's right."
Finn says: "Come and get this."
The Farm says: "Okay."
Finn says: "Just me."
Finn says: "I don't need this  clown-town."
Jake says: "The only way you're gonna win is if you use your cheap moves."
Jake says: "Hey."
Jake says: "Come on!"
Jake says: "You gotta fight the dude!"
The Farm punches Finn into the ground.
Finn says: "Ah!"
Finn says: "I can't see!"
Finn says: "Walk me to the light!"
Jake says: "Yeah, that's what you get."
The Farm punches Jake into the ground, stands over them, and drops some farm animals on them. A wave washes them further away. Finn sees a cloud that looks like a car.
Finn and Jake wake up in a dream world surrounded by cars and a blue man.
Dream Warrior says: "Awaken to your dream, Finn and Jake."
Finn says: "Whoa."
Finn says: "Who are you?"
Dream Warrior says: "I am the Dream Warrior."
Dream Warrior says: "I've summoned you to hang with me in your together dream."
Finn says: "Are you gonna show us a move to beat the Farm?"
Dream Warrior says: "First, listen."
Dream Warrior says: "Then, wake up."
Finn says: "Alright."
Dream Warrior says: "I have cheap cars."
Dream Warrior says: "My cars are che-e-eap."
Finn says: "My cars are cheap."
Jake says: "My cars are cheap."
Dream Warrior says: "But they drive bad when I turn out the lights!"
Finn says: "Turn out the lights."
Jake says: "Turn out the lights."
Dream Warrior says: "These sweatpants have another name."
Finn says: "Another name."
Jake says: "Another name."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Don't you always call sweatpants "give-up-on-life pants," Jake?"
Jake says: "I do, because peeps need to respect themselves when they leave the house..."
Jake says: "even if it's just for ice cream, or TP, or whatev."
Dream Warrior says: "Two shiny golden apples, ripe enough to bite."
Finn says: "Bite."
Jake says: "Bite."
Dream Warrior says: "That's all I gotta say for now."
Dream Warrior says: "Get lost."
Jake says: "What is going on here, Dream Warrior?"
Finn says: "Yeah, what's this all about?"
Dream Warrior says: "Nap's over, sorry."
Finn says: "Ow!"
Jake says: "Ow!"
Scene changes back to lake. Finn and Jake wake up.
Finn says: "Whoa."
Finn says: "That..."
Finn says: "was a good nap."
Jake says: "Hey, did you dream about Dream Warrior?"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "What was he trying to tell us, exactly?"
Jake says: "I don't know; I didn't get it."
Jake says: "But listen, man."
Jake says: "I'm sorry I got mad at you."
Jake says: "Who cares about my high score at Kompy?"
Jake says: "It ain't important."
Finn says: "No, man."
Finn says: "It is important."
Finn says: "Being the third best at something is math and deserves respect."
Finn says: "Not like I did to Kompy."
Finn says: "Anyway, I think we both got cranky after all that training."
Jake says: "Well, good thing we're rested, 'cause now we can beat this beast."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Oh, hey!"
Finn says: "Look!"
The beaten up Marauders return, cheering from the cliff.
Jake says: "Dudes came back to watch us fight!"
Finn says: "A'ight."
Finn says: "This is it."
Finn says: "Let's use what we learned in training."
Jake says: "Uh, all we did was fight dirty with cheap—"
Jake says: "wait."
Dream Warrior says: "My cars are che-e—"
Jake says: "Dream Warrior was telling us what cheap moves to use on the Farm!"
Jake says: "Headlights mean eyes!"
Finn says: "Mud in the eyes!"
Jake says: "Give-up-on-life pants!"
Finn says: "Pull down his pants like you did to moi!"
Jake says: "Two golden apples!"
Finn says: "Hm."
Finn says: "I think I know what that means."
Jake says: "Well, sure."
Jake says: "I can make a wild guess."
Finn says: "You ready, man?"
Jake says: "Yeah, dude!"
They bump fists.
Jake says: "Put your pants on."
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn piles mud onto Jake, who is shaped like a catapult. Jake flings the mud into the Farm's eyes. Finn then jumps onto Jake, who stretches up and pushes the barn up the Farm's body, exposing the Farm's buttocks. Finn and Jake then bite the buttocks, and the Farm falls down.
Finn and Jake, each wearing a Medallion of Brogends, are lifted up by the Marauders. They high-five and clink their medals together.
Episode ends.
