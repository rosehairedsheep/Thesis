The episode begins in Marceline's cave just outside of Marceline's house. Finn is beat-boxing and Marceline is strumming her ax bass guitar.
Marceline says: "Thanks for helping me record, Finn."
Finn says: "No problem, Marceline."
Marceline says: "Now, I'm gonna sing something really personal, so don't laugh at me."
Finn says: "I would never dream of it..."
Finn says: "m'lady."
Scene shifts to the inside of Marceline's house.
Marceline says: "Now, start a slow beat, and keep it steady, or it'll mess up everything."
Finn says: "You got it!"
Finn starts beat-boxing and Marceline begins singing the Fry Song. Eventually, Finn's beat-boxing slows down and he sighs.
Marceline says: "Huh?"
Marceline says: "Finn, you messed the beat up!"
Finn says: "Marceline, if you're thinkin' about your dad so much, then..."
Finn says: "why don't you go see 'im?"
Marceline says: "He's not worth the effort."
Finn says: "Not worth what effort?"
Marceline says: "Well..."
Marceline says: "first, I'd have to draw a circle with a happy face in the center and then..."
Marceline says: "uh..."
Marceline says: "douse it with bug milk."
[Note says: "Marceline is not paying attention to Finn's actions."
Marceline says: "Huh?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Finn says: "Wwwwhhhat?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Whoa..."
Finn says: "whoa!!"
Finn says: "Aaagh!!"
Marceline's father emerges.
Lord of Evil says: "Marceline!"
Marceline says: "Finn..."
Marceline says: "what the heck did you do?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Finn says: "I..."
Finn says: "reunited you with your family?"
Marceline grunts angrily and Finn backs away.
Lord of Evil says: "Is this kid your evil servant?"
Finn says: "I'm not evil, Marceline's dad."
Finn says: "I'm super good!"
Lord of Evil says: ""Super good?"
Finn says: "What're you doing?!"
Finn says: "!"
Lord of Evil says: "Stealing your soul."
He continues and Finn screams in fright.
Marceline says: "Dad!"
Marceline says: "Ugh!"
Marceline says: "You always do stuff like this!"
Lord of Evil says: "Haha!"
Lord of Evil says: "Oh, Marceline!"
Lord of Evil says: "I never know what's gonna set you off!"
Lord of Evil says: "Whoa!"
Lord of Evil says: "Is this the family ax?"
Marceline says: "Wha—"
Marceline says: "?"
Marceline says: "HEY!!!"
Lord of Evil says: "Did you turn it into some kind of lute?"
Marceline says: "Give it back, and get out!!!"
Lord of Evil says: "Okay, I'll go."
Lord of Evil says: "I've got business to attend to, anyway—"
Lord of Evil says: "sucking up all the souls in Oooooo..."
Finn says: "WHA—"
Finn says: "Gh—"
Finn says: "NO!!"
Lord of Evil says: "See you kids later!"
Lord of Evil laughs maniacally as Finn screams, terrified. Marceline's father shuts the door.
Marceline says: "My bass!"
Finn says: "I've unleashed evil onto Ooo!"
Finn says: "We've gotta stop 'im, Marceline!"
Marceline says: "Fine..."
Marceline says: "but I'm only coming with you to get my bass back."
Scene shifts to Finn and Marceline flying above a forest.
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "How do I kill this guy, anyway?"
Marceline says: "Finn!"
Marceline says: "You can't kill my dad!"
Finn says: "Oh!"
Finn says: "I'm sorry!"
Finn says: "I didn't mean—"
Marceline says: "No!"
Marceline says: "You literally can't kill my dad!"
Marceline says: "He's deathless!"
Finn says: "Oh..."
Scene cuts to a field elsewhere; a bunch of Fluffy People are running around and laughing.
Fluffy Person says: "Who the fluff are you?"
Lord of Evil says: "Um..."
Lord of Evil says: "Well, I'm sure not the guy who's gonna suck out your soul."
Fluffy Person says: "Good 'cause that's, like, my number one fear."
Lord of Evil says: "Really!"
Lord of Evil says: "?"
Lord of Evil says: "Well..."
Lord of Evil says: "I know a little exercise for that!"
Lord of Evil says: "Wanna try??"
Fluffy Person says: "Wow..."
Lord of Evil says: "First..."
Lord of Evil says: "close your eyes."
Fluffy Person says: "Okay!"
Fluffy Person says: "AAH!"
Fluffy Person says: "You coulda killed me!"
Lord of Evil says: "Ah, but I didn't!"
Lord of Evil says: "And now, aren't you thrilled just to be alive?"
Fluffy Person says: "Yeah, I guess..."
Fluffy Person says: "So what?"
Lord of Evil says: "So..."
Lord of Evil says: "This next part will be all the more..."
Lord of Evil says: "horrifying."
Finn says: "There!!"
Finn says: "Below us!"
Finn says: "A gathering of Fluffy People!"
Finn says: "May-haps they've seen your father!"
Finn says: "Marceline..."
Finn says: "release the Finn-bomb!"
Finn says: "They're all freaked out!"
Marceline says: "It's because they're scared of him."
Marceline says: "Hm."
Marceline says: "My dad's been here."
Marceline says: "Come on."
Marceline says: "Let's go."
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "We gotta help this guy."
Finn says: "I've got some soul food that Jake packed for me."
Finn says: "You like, uh, collard greens or country-fried steak?"
Finn tries to feed the Fluffy Person the food but he keeps moaning and doesn't eat it.
Marceline says: "Look."
Marceline says: "You wanna help him?"
Marceline says: "Help me get my bass back."
Finn says: "How will that help hi—"
Finn says: "?"
Marceline says: "MY DAD STOLE MY BASS GUITAR, FINN!!"
Marceline says: "And when I get it back..."
Marceline says: "I'm gonna break it over his neck and slam my dad back into the Nightosphere!"
Fluffy Person bumps into Finn.
Finn says: "Oh, clam!"
Finn says: "But first you gotta return the souls your dad sucked back to these sad, little husks."
Finn says: "Right, Marceline?"
Marceline says: "Uh, sure, yeah, yeah, we'll do that."
Scene cuts to the Marauder Village. The Marauders are sitting at a table talking.
Head Marauder says: "So I popped his head like a cork!"
Head Marauder says: "And I says, "That's what I think of Expanding Earth Theory!"
They all laugh. A noise is heard and they stop laughing.
Lord of Evil says: "Alright."
Marauders says: "Huh?!"
Marauders says: "!"
Lord of Evil says: "I've got a joke, too."
Lord of Evil says: "What wears a dark suit, is completely evil, and is about to suck out all your souls?"
Head Marauder says: "Yo mama!"
Scene cuts back to Finn and Marceline.
Marceline says: "Red Rock Pass."
Marceline says: "If my dad wants to get through the mountains, he'll have to come through here."
Finn says: "We can work together!"
Finn says: "And smash 'im with this rock!"
Finn says: "And once he's smooshed, all the souls will go back to their rightful bods."
Finn notices the Lord of Evil in the pass singing "Stompin' On Ants." The Lord of Evil then sucks the ants' souls. Finn tries to push the rock, but he notices that Marceline flew down to attack her father by herself instead. She hisses and charges, but misses her father who ducks.
Lord of Evil says: "So, finally taking a run at your old man, huh?"
Marceline charges, but her father parries the attack and forces her to a wall. Marceline hisses.
Marceline says: "Daddy..."
Marceline jumps on her father's shoulders.
Finn says: "Marceline!!"
Finn says: "Keep 'im right there!!"
Finn says: "HrrrrRAAAAGH!!!"
Finn headbutts the rock to make it fall off the cliff and groans in pain. While fighting, Marceline and her father manage to evade the rock. Finn adopts a look of desperation. Marceline struggles to reclaim her bass.
Lord of Evil says: "Karate chop!!"
Lord of Evil says: "You can't destroy me!"
Lord of Evil says: "You're not even alive!"
Marceline rests next to Finn.
Finn says: "You blew it, dude."
Finn says: "We're supposed to be a team—"
Finn says: "a team whose sport is stop-your-dad-from-suckin'-souls..."
Finn says: "ball."
Marceline says: "I just want my dad to care about me."
Finn frowns; scene shifts to the Ice Kingdom.
Lord of Evil says: "Of all history's greatest monsters, you are by far the most evil thing I've encountered."
Lord of Evil says: "Offer your soul to me, dark one."
Gunter says: "Wenk wenk."
Lord of Evil says: "NO!"
Lord of Evil says: "You can't have my soul!"
Lord of Evil says: "I don't even..."
Lord of Evil says: "!"
Lord of Evil says: "Look, just get in here."
He tries to suck its soul, but it slaps him.
Gunter says: "Wenk wenk."
Lord of Evil says: "Keep your crummy soul!"
Gunter flies through the air, crying, and is caught by the Ice King.
Ice King says: "Gunter!"
Ice King says: "Who told you you could fly?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Gunter says: "Wenk."
Lord of Evil sucks another penguin's soul.
Ice King says: "Huh?"
Ice King says: "No one sucks the life from my penguins except me!"
Ice King says: "..."
Ice King says: "And maybe polar bears, because that's just nature, Gunter."
Lord of Evil sucks all of the penguins' souls and starts growing.
Lord of Evil says: "YES!!"
Marceline and Finn are shown hurrying over.
Finn says: "Aw, man!"
Finn says: "He's growing huge!"
Lord of Evil sucks some birds' souls; he begins sucking souls from all over Ooo.
Finn says: "I'm gonna take 'im down!"
Marceline says: "Finn, you're like an ant to him."
Finn says: "Oh, yeah?"
Finn says: "Well, this ant's about to get in his pants!"
Marceline says: "What?"
Finn says: "Give up those souls, Marceline's dad!"
Finn says: "In the name of justice!!"
Lord of Evil says: "Huh?"
Lord of Evil says: "Oh, Marceline."
Lord of Evil says: "Still following me?"
Marceline says: "I'll stop following you if you give me back my guitar!"
Lord of Evil says: "No, Marceline."
Finn says: "The souls..."
Finn says: "Lumpy Space Princess!"
Finn says: "He got your soul, too?!"
Finn says: "!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Nah."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I totally saw Hot Dog Princess get sucked in here, and I wasn't invited?!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I was all, "What the lump?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "" so I'm crashin' this party!"
Finn says: "Well, I'll save you..."
Finn says: "I'LL SAVE ALL OF YOU!!"
Lord of Evil tries to knock Finn off with his appendage; Finn evades and struggles until he cuts off the appendage, making himself and the Ax bass fall; Marceline rushes over and catches the bass, letting Finn hit the ground.
Marceline says: "IN YOUR FACE, DAD!"
Lord of Evil says: "Give back that ax, Marceline!"
Lord of Evil says: "You don't respect it enough!"
Marceline says: "Well..."
Marceline says: "you don't respect anything!"
Marceline says: "Dad!!"
Marceline says: "DAD!!"
Marceline says: "I'm outta here!"
Finn says: "BUT—"
Finn says: "!!"
Lord of Evil says: "Fine!!"
Lord of Evil says: "Go!!"
Lord of Evil says: "I'm too busy sucking to deal with you!"
Finn says: "NO, WAIT!"
Finn says: "Marceline!!"
Finn says: "Keep talking to 'im!"
Finn says: "When he's talking, he can't steal souls!!"
Marceline says: "I said I'm outta here!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, my Glob, you guys!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Drama bomb!"
Lord of Evil says: "Marceline, do you really feel this way?"
Marceline says: "Dad, I..."
Finn sneaks closer to the Lord of Evil.
Lord of Evil says: "Marceline..."
Lord of Evil says: "of course I love you."
Marceline says: "Dad..."
Lord of Evil says: "I'm sorry I ate your fries."
Lord of Evil says: "I didn't mean to hurt you."
Marceline says: "It's okay, Dad."
Marceline says: "It's..."
Marceline says: "it's really okay."
Lord of Evil says: "No, it's not okay."
Lord of Evil says: "They weren't even very good."
Lord of Evil says: "They were really cold."
Lord of Evil says: "I love you, Marceline."
Lord of Evil says: "Don't you ever doubt that."
Marceline says: "I love you, too, Dad."
Lord of Evil says: "Oh, Marceline, I am so—"
Finn says: "YALALALALALALALALALALALALA!!!!!"
Finn stabs the Lord of Evil's soul sack with two swords making him scream in pain; the souls are released. Finn drops down and repeats the summoning process.
Finn says: "MALOSO VOBISCUM ET CUM SPIRITUM!!"
Finn says: "YES!!!!"
Marceline says: "Finn!!"
Marceline says: "How could you do that?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Finn says: "How could I..."
Finn says: "save the day?"
Marceline says: "How could you embarrass me like that and then stab my dad?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Finn says: "How could I embarrass-save you??"
Finn says: "WHOA!"
Finn says: "Marceline!"
Marceline says: "I'm glad he's back in the Nightosphere."
Marceline says: "That was emotionally exhausting."
Finn says: "I'm also exhausted emotionally."
Finn says: "Or..."
Finn says: "wait."
Finn says: "I mean, I mean physically."
Finn falls down on the ground, exhausted. Marceline joins him. The souls are floating around the sky and Marceline chuckles at them.
Marceline says: "I've been meaning to ask you..."
Marceline says: "What's with that pocket on your shirt?"
Finn says: "Oh, Jake's in here."
Finn says: "'Sup, Jake?"
Jake rolls over, farts and the episode ends.
