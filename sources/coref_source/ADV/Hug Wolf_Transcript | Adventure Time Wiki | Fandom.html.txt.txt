The episode begins showing a black tree. It turns to show its face.
Finn says: "The Tree of Blight."
The tree roars in the center of a dark forest; the camera pans out to show Finn and Jake.
Finn says: "Every hundred years, it spews evil spores across the land."
Jake says: "Then let's burn its butt down to the root rubbin's."
Jake says: "Finn, I can feel a bunch of eyeballs peepin' us from the woods."
The Alpha Hug Wolf suddenly lunges out and Finn and Jake gasp. She lands next to the duo and punches Finn rather softly.
Alpha Hug Wolf says: "Huuugs!"
Finn says: "What the—"
Finn says: "?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Is this an extra butt?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Quick, Jake!"
Finn says: "Burn the tree!"
Jake runs off.
Alpha Hug Wolf says: "Huuuugs!"
Alpha Hug Wolf says: "Gonna hug you up, boy!"
Alpha Hug Wolf says: "I'm gonna snuggle you to pieces!"
Jake says: "Dude!"
Jake says: "The tree's about to 'splode its evil juice all over!"
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "Jake, hurry!"
Jake says: "Is he crushin' you, man?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "No, he's just..."
Finn says: "hugging me gently!"
Jake says: "Oh..."
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "When you see the wicker devil in tree afterlife, tell 'im Jake says, "Hello."
Jake sets the tree on fire which makes it explode; a piece of the tree lands on the ‎Alpha Hug Wolf and she runs off screaming. Finn is violently coughing.
Jake says: "Hey, buddy, you okay?"
Finn says: "Didn't even tell me its name..."
Jake says: "Wha.."
Jake says: ",?"
Finn says: "Oh, sweet!"
Finn says: "Ha-ha-ha!"
Finn says: "Hot to the touch!"
Jake says: "Hot to the touch!"
Scene cuts to Finn and Jake's Tree Fort. Jake is whistling and playing Portender Defender on BMO. He notices Finn is hugging BMO and stops playing.
Jake says: "Hmmmm..."
Jake says: "Dude, why're you so huggy?"
Finn says: "I just feel affectionate, I guess."
Finn says: "Hugging helps."
Jake says: "Hmm..."
Jake says: "You've got a fever, man."
Finn says: "I feel hot."
BMO says: "Finn, you're hurting me."
Jake says: "I think you need a good night's sleep."
Scene transition to Finn and Jake's bedroom. Finn is seen hugging a pillow and Jake blows out a candle. Finn whines like a dog in his sleep. Cut to the next day; Finn and Jake are picking up litter in the Candy Kingdom.
Jake says: "You feelin' better today?"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "I feel like a million clams."
Jake says: "Good."
Jake says: "Hey, you think we have enough candy litter?"
Jake says: "Litter for lunch!"
Jake says: "Mmm!"
Finn continues picking it up and Cinnamon Bun enters and runs into Finn.
Cinnamon Bun says: "Huh?"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Not again!"
Finn says: "What's the matter, Cinnamon Bun?"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Please, Finn."
Cinnamon Bun says: "If you're gonna hug me again, don't make it as hard as you hugged me last night."
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "I didn't hug you last night."
Cinnamon Bun says: "Yes, you did!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "My love handles still hurt!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "You came into my room around midnight and gave me a squeeze—"
Cinnamon Bun says: "a really strong one!"
Jake joins in.
Finn says: "CB says I hugged 'im."
Finn says: "Haha."
Finn says: "Cinnamon Bun, you got some crazy notions."
Finn says: "I tell ya."
Finn says: "What a crazy story, buddy."
Jake says: "Yeah, buddy, but you were pretty huggy last night..."
Jake says: "buddy."
Finn says: "Wait."
Finn says: "You don't think I actually snuck into Cinnamon Bun's room and hugged him, do you?"
Jake says: "I'm just sayin' you were really clingy."
Finn says: "But no."
Finn says: "Why would I?"
Finn says: "And don't tell me it's because I have repressed emotional feelings for Cinnamon Bun."
Jake says: "No."
Jake says: "I have a theory,..."
Jake says: "but I don't like it."
Scene cuts to a library.
Jake says: "Your questionable behavior started about an hour or so after you got hugged by that wolf man, right?"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "So..."
Finn says: "?"
Jake pulls out a book and drops it on the ground. Jake opens it.
Jake says: "Well, I've been thinkin' that maybe that wolf man wasn't what he seemed."
Jake says: "Maybe he was some sort of hug wolf."
Jake says: "Yeah, here it is."
Jake says: ""Hug wolves—"
Jake says: "a subset of wolf men which roam the countryside with a fervid hug lust."
Jake says: "Every night, hug wolves must go out and hug people to satisfy their insatiable craving for hugs."
Jake says: "To become a hug wolf, one must be hugged by an alpha hug wolf on the night of a full moon."
Jake says: ""!"
Finn says: "Like last night!"
Jake says: "Yes."
Jake says: "So you must be a beta hug wolf."
Jake says: "A lower-level creature."
Finn says: "Well, how can I get uncursed?"
Jake says: "Lemme, um..."
Jake says: "read the book a little more."
Jake says: "Says there's no known cure."
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "I'm scared, Jake..."
Jake says: "No hugs!!"
Finn says: "I'm sorry!"
Finn says: "I feel hot!"
Finn says: "Rrrrr!!"
Jake looks worried. Cut back to the Tree Fort where Jake is covering Finn with bags of frozen peas. BMO is whimpering.
Jake says: "What's wrong, BMO?"
BMO says: "I am terrified of Finn."
Jake says: "Hmm."
Jake says: "Well, that plant's not gonna protect you."
Jake says: "You can get this under control, buddy."
Jake says: "ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??"
Finn says: "I think so."
Jake says: "I said..."
Jake says: "ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "I heard you."
Finn says: "I said I think so."
Jake says: "I'm tryin'a' getcha to shout."
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "IS THIS GOOD?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "?"
Jake says: "Never mind."
Jake says: "Now."
Jake says: "I want you to think about hugging a cactus."
Jake says: "How would that feel?"
Finn says: "Prickly and painful."
Jake says: "Good, good, you're doin' great!"
Finn says: "Cool."
Finn says: "So, can I hug the cactus now?"
Jake says: "No, you can't hug anything."
Finn says: "But that poor cactus!"
Finn says: "It..."
Finn says: "it..."
Finn says: "NEEDS ME!"
Jake says: "Oh, no, the hug lust is already takin' over your brain!"
Finn says: "I want to hug you, Jake!"
Finn says: "Close!"
Jake ties Finn up with rope then chains him down.
Jake says: "Finn..."
Jake says: "say something to reassure me."
Finn says: "I'LL HUG YOUR MOM!"
Jake makes a frightened noise and backs away quickly.
BMO says: "Jake!"
BMO says: "We need the silver baseball!"
The full moon outside is shown and shines from behind the clouds. Finn completes his transformation.
Finn says: "Hrrugs!!"
Finn says: "HUGS FOR BUDDIES!"
BMO says: "Oh, Glob!"
BMO says: "Oh, my Glob, Jake!"
BMO says: "Mama!"
Finn says: "Bring it in, guys!"
BMO says: "Screamoooo!"
Jake says: "BMO!"
Jake says: "Strobe light mode!"
Finn says: "Not cool!"
Jake says: "Back, beast!"
Finn says: "Hug wolf, away!"
Finn busts out of a window howling and runs to the Candy Kingdom. The scene cuts there.
Mr. Cupcake says: "Surely this frosted drink will soothe my fevered tempers."
Mr. Cupcake says: "Hellooo?"
Mr. Cupcake says: "Good heavens!"
Mr. Cupcake says: "A lycanthrope!"
Mr. Cupcake says: "AAAAH!!"
Finn jumps to the Gumdrop teenager's balcony and enters her room and creeps towards her in bed.
Gumdrop teenager says: "Dracula?"
Gumdrop teenager says: "AAAAH!!"
Gumdrop teenager says: "Eeee!!"
Finn says: "HUUUUGS!!"
The Gumdrop Dad bursts in holding a Candy cane shotgun.
Gumdrop dad says: "Get away from my daughter, ya hairy teenager!"
Gumdrop teenager says: "Aaah!!"
Gumdrop dad says: "Ch-ch."
Transition to the next day; Jake is walking with BMO in the Candy Kingdom.
Jake says: "Finn?"
Jake says: "Finn?"
BMO says: "There he is!"
Finn is in a river. Jake shakes him awake.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "What..."
Finn says: "What happened?"
Finn says: "Jake..."
Finn says: "what happened to me last night?"
Jake says: "You hugged..."
Jake says: "everyone."
Finn says: "NO!"
Candy People appear and shout angrily.
Upside-Down Ice Cream Cone says: "We're mad, but we're not gonna go down there."
Finn says: "People of the Candy Kingdom, all I've ever wanted was to keep you all safe,..."
Finn says: "and because I can't undo the hugs I've caused, my sole wish is to be locked up forever in the Candy Dungeon."
Scene cuts to the Candy Dungeon.
Candy Baby says: "Why's Finn in the cage, Mama?"
Candy Baby says: "Isn't hugs nice?"
Candy Mother says: "Oh, baby..."
Jake says: "Candy People, let's make sure that Alpha Hug Wolf pays for what he's done!!"
Candy Person #29 says: "Yeah!"
Candy Person #33 says: "Yeah, I agree with the last guy!"
Jake says: "Cinnamon Bun, you watch over Finn!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Uuuuuhhhh..."
Jake says: "Let's go, boys!!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Uh..."
Cinnamon Bun says: "bu-, bububut..."
Crowd says: "No more hugs!"
Crowd says: "No more hugs!"
Crowd says: "No more hugs!"
Random Candy Person says: "Without consent!!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Finn?"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "Cinnamon Bun..."
Finn says: "let me out..."
Cinnamon Bun says: "I-I-I-I'm not supposed to."
Finn says: "Don't you want a hug?"
Cinnamon Bun says: "I can't, man!"
Finn says: "Not even a little one?"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Uuuuhhh..."
Finn says: "You want a hug?"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Owww!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Ow, my sides."
Scene cuts to the forest from the beginning of the episode.
Candy crowd says: "SAY NO TO HUGS!"
Jake says: "I smell someone bein' hugged right now!"
Antelope says: "Uh..."
Antelope says: "I have a wife."
Jake says: "That hug be your last, demon!"
Jake stretches his arms and repeatedly punches the ‎Alpha Hug Wolf.
Alpha Hug Wolf says: "Rrr..."
Alpha Hug Wolf says: "still love you!"
Alpha Hug Wolf says: "Raaah!"
Alpha Hug Wolf says: "Come here, baby!"
Jake says: "No huggies!"
Jake says: "Eh..."
Jake says: "Finn..."
Jake says: "I've failed you."
Suddenly, Finn lunges out in the same way the Alpha Hug Wolf did at the beginning of the episode and tackles her. They commence their "hug battle.".
Alpha Hug Wolf says: "I'm gonna hug you up."
Finn says: "You call that a hug?"
They continue their battle.
Jake says: "This is the biggest hug that's ever existed!"
Finn and the wolf begin sparking as they battle. The ‎Alpha Hug Wolf forces Finn near a cliff, but Finn gets a hold of her before she can push him off. They both start glowing; they howl as soon an explosion occurs and forms a heart-shaped cloud that blows several mountain goats away. The smoke clears.
Finn says: "Uuuugghhh..."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "You..."
Finn says: "You stopped hugging me."
Beautiful Lady says: "Yeah..."
Beautiful Lady says: "You stopped, too."
Finn says: "I just..."
Finn says: "didn't feel like I needed any more hugs."
Beautiful Lady says: "Me neither."
Candy Person #29 says: "The curse is broken!"
Jake says: "Can I get a hug?"
Finn says: "JAKE!!!!!"
Suddenly, the girl turns into another screeching Tree of Blight.
Jake says: "AAAH—"
Jake says: "!"
The episode ends.
