The episode begins with Finn and Jake walking in Marceline's cave. Finn is holding a balloon, and Jake is holding his viola.
Finn says: "Do you think it's right for Marceline to invite us to jam without Princess and BMO?"
Jake says: "It's just a jam sesh."
Jake says: "Is that what you're gonna jam with?"
Finn says: "Yeah, man."
Finn says: "Balloon music is the future."
Finn says: "Listen."
Jake says: "Pretty good."
Jake says: "I don't think you mastered it yet."
Finn says: "Well, duh."
Finn says: "I just started."
Jake says: "Oh, dude."
Jake says: "There's a note."
Finn says: "What's it say?"
Jake says: ""Hey, guys, I had to run out, but I'll be back," blee-bloo-blop, "Don't go in my house."
Finn says: "That's it?"
Jake says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "Just "Don't go in my house" in all caps..."
Jake says: "written in blood."
Finn says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "What are you doing?"
Jake says: "Eliminating desire from my heart."
Jake says: "It helps pass the time."
Finn says: "Come on!"
Finn says: "I can't do that!"
Finn says: "Let's play Cloud Hunt 'til she gets here."
Jake says: "No, man, I got a mental block with Cloud Hunt!"
Finn says: "Yeah, that's what makes it awesome, 'cause I know I'll win."
Jake says: "Oh, what?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Bring it on, brother!"
Jake says: "Now explain the rules 'cause I forget."
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "I count to ten and you go hide somewhere."
Finn says: "Then, I gotta try to find you."
Finn says: "You can hide..."
Finn says: "anywhere in here."
Finn says: "Anywhere in here,..."
Finn says: "but Marcy's house is off limits because she said so."
Finn says: "Okay?"
Jake says: "Got it."
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "I'm gonna start counting."
Finn says: "Ready?"
Jake says: "Yes."
Finn says: "Go!"
Finn says: "One..."
Finn says: "Two..."
Finn says: "Three..."
Finn says: "Four..."
Finn says: "Five..."
Finn says: "Four..."
While Finn is counting, Jake goes through Marceline's dog-door. Finn then recites the poem that goes with Cloud Hunt.
Finn says: "Cloud Hunt..."
Finn says: "GOTCHA!"
Finn says: "Huh."
Finn says: "Hmm."
Marceline appears. Jake and Finn go upstairs before she can spot them.
Marceline says: "Smells like sourdough in here."
Cuts to upstairs in Marceline's bedroom; Finn and Jake hide in her closet.
Jake says: "She's gonna kill us."
Jake says: "Once she finds out she's gonna tie us up and eat us like a spider."
Finn says: "You don't think I know that?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Hmmmmmmm..."
Finn says: "We'll wait for the right moment and sneak out..."
Finn says: "right under her big, fat caboose."
Jake says: "Okay, man."
Jake says: "I can do this."
Jake says: "Egh!"
Jake says: "Egh!"
Jake says: "Egh!!"
Finn says: "Shh, here she comes!"
Marceline pokes her head through her floor door.
Jake says: "Here she comes..."
Finn says: "Shh, shh!!"
Marceline sniffs around. She turns the lights on and sniffs again.
Marceline says: "Huh."
She goes to the bathroom to urinate.
Jake says: "Let's get outta here."
Finn attempts to open the closet door; it creaks.
Marceline says: "Hello?"
Marceline flushes and comes out of the bathroom.
Jake says: "She didn't wash hands!"
Marceline says: "Is someone here?"
Finn says: "Shh!!"
Marceline sniffs; Finn and Jake get distressed. Eventually she sniffs her armpit.
Marceline says: "That's what stinks."
The scene cuts to Finn and Jake's Tree Fort where their phone is ringing.
Finn says: "This is Jake!"
Jake says: "And this is Finn!"
They both begin to laugh on the voicemail; scene cuts back to Marceline's bedroom.
Finn says: "We're not home right now, so..."
Jake says: "We're not home right now, so..."
Marceline says: "Uh..."
Marceline says: "Yeah, hey, you guys."
Marceline says: "Are you still coming over?"
Marceline says: "It's jam time, so, like, call me, 'kay?"
She hangs up, then picks her nose; Finn and Jake are disgusted. She flicks the booger in the closet and it hits Jake. Finn and Jake look at each other for a moment. Suddenly Finn looks like he got an idea. He goes through Marceline's clothing looking for something. Finn and Jake whisper.
Jake says: "Whatcha doin'?"
Finn says: "When she gets this, she'll leave and we can escape!"
Jake says: "Brilliant..."
Jake says: "but how's it gonna work?"
Finn says: "I'll fly the paper as an airplane down the bedroom ladder."
Finn says: "It'll triple barrel roll past the kitchen, open the fridge, and cook some eggs, then eat the eggs, and unfold itself as it lays in the carpet in front of Marceline's door!"
Jake says: "Yeah, yeah, awesome, yeah!!"
Finn throws the paper airplane. It almost lands in the waste bin, but it goes down the bedroom ladder instead, and goes into the kitchen. It opens the fridge, and grabs three eggs; it drops two, turns the oven on and cooks the one. It grabs a fork and pushes the frying pan off the oven. It flies upstairs and finally lands in the waste bin.
Jake says: "No, nah, nuts!"
Marceline is laying on her bed staring at the ceiling.
Marceline says: "Welp..."
Marceline says: "they're not gonna show up, then I'll just work on my own stuff, I guess."
Marceline says: "I..."
Marceline says: "I wanna make this the most emotional album ever."
Marceline says: "So private and secret, that I'll never let anyone hear."
Jake says: "This is so wrong."
Marceline says: "No one can ever hear it."
Marceline says: "Ever."
Marceline says: "Take one."
She opens her notebook. A drumset plays in the background. Marceline begins singing the Journal Song.
Jake says: "We've crossed the line!"
Jake says: "I'm gettin' outta here, man!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Do it!"
Jake breaks through, shrinks down, and tries to escape, but a spider scares him. He runs in the opposite direction and jumps on Finn. The spider hisses and Finn and Jake climb up to avoid it. Jake takes a shoe box lid and pushes the spider out of the closet. Marceline is still singing. The spider crawls up to a table lamp.
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "What's it doing?!"
Finn says: "!"
The spider begins pushing the lamp. Finn and Jake gasp. The spider pushes the lamp off the table, shattering it.
Finn says: "Shh, shh, shh!!"
Jake says: "Shh, shh, shh!!"
Marceline says: "Oh, what?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Marceline says: "What happened?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Marceline says: "Ugh!"
Marceline says: "Where are you?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Marceline says: "Oh, there you are..."
Marceline says: "My broom."
Finn and Jake are shown hiding in a coat. Finn gives Jake a thumbs up. Marceline tries to clean up the mess, but has trouble getting a big piece of the lamp in the dust pan.
Marceline says: "Ugh!"
She floats over to her bathroom again and turns on her bathtub faucet.
Finn says: "Is it safe?"
Jake says: "I dunno, man."
Jake says: "Go scope the scene."
Finn gives a thumbs up and drops out of the coat. He crawls to the bathroom. Suddenly, Marceline enters pulling her sock off viewed only from the legs down, and Finn blushes. He retreats back to the closet and gets back in the coat.
Jake says: "What happened, man?"
Finn says: "I'm not goin' back out there."
Jake says: "Well..."
Jake says: "whaddaya mean?"
Jake says: "What happened?"
Jake says: "Bro?"
Marceline comes out of the bathroom fully clothed blow-drying her hair. She yawns, turns off the lights, and floats over her bed to go to sleep. Finn and Jake sneak out of the closet. The spider lands on Finn's face and he tosses it onto Jake. The spider bites Jake; Jake mouths a scream and tears roll out of his eyes. They both continue to the bedroom ladder.
Finn says: "Is she awake?"
Jake says: "Why are you talking?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "I'm wondering if she's awake."
Jake says: "Well, if she's awake, she can definitely hear you talking!"
Finn says: "I'm whispering."
Jake says: "Well, now we're both quietly screaming."
Marceline says: "I can hear both of you."
Finn says: "Disguise yourself, fool!"
Marceline turns on the light and observes Jake shape shifted into Finn and Finn with a lampshade over his head.
Marceline says: "What're you bozos doing in my lair?"
Jake says: "Dude, I think she sees us!"
Finn says: "What the—"
Finn says: "?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "DUDE!"
Finn says: "You shape-changed to look like me?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Well, yeah!"
Marceline says: "HEY!"
Marceline says: "Exssssplain yourselves."
Finn says: "We were playing hide-and-seek in your closet and you came home, so we hid in there all day."
Finn says: "We saw..."
Finn says: "everything."
Finn says: "And, oh, Glob, I mean, whatever you do to us, I just wanna say, we're sorry."
Jake says: "So sorry."
Marceline says: "Okay..."
Marceline says: "apology accepted."
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Marceline says: "I hide in your house all the time."
Finn and Jake stare at each other. Cut to the outside of Marceline's house.
Marceline says: "Anyways, no hard feelings, guys!"
Marceline says: "See you soon!"
The scene goes back to Finn's and Jake's bedroom in the Tree Fort. Finn is reading on his bed. He scratches near his left buttock and sniffs his hand. Finn hears hooting and blushes.
Finn says: "Marceline?"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Jake stops showering.
Jake says: "Hmm?"
Jake says: "Hey, man, did—"
Finn says: "AAAAAAH!!"
Jake says: "AAAAAAH!!"
Camera pans up to the roof of the Tree Fort. It is revealed that Marceline was the one hooting. She hoots once more, and the episode ends.
