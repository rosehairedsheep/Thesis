The episode begins at the Tree Fort, where Finn and Jake are sleeping. Suddenly, their whole room starts shaking and they wake up.
Finn says: "What's shakin'?"
Jake says: "I-I don't know."
Finn says: "What if I'm still asleep?"
Jake says: "Then we're sharin' the same dream, dude."
Jake says: "Look out your window!"
Finn sees a monster outside his window. It roars and fireworks shoot out of its mouth.
Finn says: "Aah!"
Finn says: "Dream monster!"
Finn and Jake get out of bed and walk to the window. They see the monster roar, punch the ground, and run into the forest.
Finn says: "Quick, let's go enjoy this dream before we wake up!"
They run outside while cheering and run up to the monster, who starts punching the ground around them.
Finn says: "♫ Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream..."
Jake says: "♫ Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream..."
The monster roars and kicks Jake into the distance.
Jake says: "Whoaaaaa!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Dreamy, dream, dream..."
Jake says: "Hey, man, I don't think this is a dream."
Finn says: "Hmm?"
The monster roars and fireworks shoot out of its mouth.
Finn says: "Oh, well, then it's time to get real."
Finn starts hacking at the monster with his sword while Jake punches it. The monster tries to grab and punch them but misses. They stop fighting when they hear a voice from inside the monster.
Voice says: "Help!"
Voice says: "Somebody help!"
Voice says: "Help!"
Voice says: "Help me!"
Voice says: "Help me!"
Finn says: "The monster ate somebody!"
Finn says: "We have to go inside its guts!"
Jake says: "Ughhhh, monster guts."
The monster roars as fireworks shoot out of his mouth. It starts pulling up trees and stuffing them in its mouth. Finn and Jake grab onto one of the trees and the monster swallows them. They land in its stomach.
Jake says: "Bleh."
Voice says: "Help!"
Voice says: "Somebody help!"
Finn says: "Hyup!"
Jake says: "Eeeeeeee!"
They slide down to a little ditch and Jake falls into a puddle.
Jake says: "Ohhhhh."
Jake says: "It's gross!"
Behind Finn in the distance is a bear, which turns out to be source of the voice.
Bear says: "Help!"
Finn says: "C'mon!"
Bear says: "Help!"
Bear says: "Help me..."
Bear says: "hang these streamers!"
Finn says: "What?!"
Jake says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "!"
Bear says: "It's not a party without streamers!"
Finn says: "Dude, this isn't a party!"
Finn says: "We gotta get you outta here!"
Finn picks up the bear but it evades his grasp and climbs on his back.
Finn says: "Jake, help me!"
Fireworks are heard nearby and their light flashes on Finn and Jake.
Bear says: "It's starting!"
Bear says: "Hehehehehehe!"
Finn and Jake follow the bear into a large room with hundreds of dancing bears. Fireworks explode overhead and loud dance music plays.
Finn says: "These crazy bears don't know they're in danger!"
Jake says: "Well..."
Jake says: "we should go."
Finn says: "Jake, wait."
Finn says: "We have to help them."
Jake says: "They're partying!"
Jake says: "They're fine."
Finn says: "Okay, Jake, what happens when you eat food?"
Jake says: "Well, it goes into your stomach..."
Finn says: "Yeah..."
Finn says: "?"
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "and then it stays there for a bit, and then it turns into—"
Jake says: "They're all gonna turn into..."
Jake says: "the stuff!"
Finn says: "Hey, excuse me!"
Finn says: "Excuse me!"
Finn says: "I don't know how you don't know this, but y'all are partyin' in a monster's stomach!"
Bear says: "Thanks!"
Bear says: "I love dancing!"
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "Y'ALL..."
Finn says: "are PARTYIN'..."
Finn says: "in a MONSTER'S..."
Finn says: "STOMACH!"
Bear says: "I THINK HE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE THE BATHROOM IS!"
Other bear says: "IT'S OVER THERE!"
Someone off screen says: "Hey..."
Finn and Jake turn to see a small bear dancing towards them.
Cubby says: "I'm Cubby."
Finn says: "Hi, Cubby."
Jake says: "What's goin' on?"
Cubby says: "I heard what you said..."
Cubby says: "about this being a monster's belly?"
Cubby says: "I've been telling everyone that for three days!"
Finn says: "Why won't they listen?"
Cubby says: "'Cause I'm just a kid!"
Older bear says: "Cubby!"
Older bear says: "Are you bothering these guys with your fantasy stories?"
Cubby says: "No!"
Cubby says: "I wasn't!"
Cubby says: "I swear!"
Cubby says: "I'm dancing, see?"
Cubby says: "SEE?!"
Cubby says: "!"
Older bear says: "Hmm..."
Finn says: "Cubby, is there anything we can do to help?"
Cubby says: "You could talk to Party Pat."
Finn says: "Party Pat?"
Cubby says: "He's our chief."
Cubby says: "If you can convince him to leave, all will follow."
Finn says: "Can you take us to him?"
Cubby says: "Sure."
Cubby says: "He sleeps on the monster's heart."
Cubby says: "It's like a blood waterbed."
They follow Cubby away from the party.
Cubby says: "This is as far as I go."
Cubby says: "Party Pat is right around this corner."
Cubby says: "Bye, you guys!"
Finn says: "Bye, Cubby!"
Jake says: "Bye!"
They look around the corner and see a tall bear lying on a heart staring at them.
Finn says: "Uhh..."
Finn says: "we're lookin' for Party Pat?"
The bear pulls a chain with his foot, lighting up the neon sign above him that reads "Party Pat.".
Finn says: "Oh, uh..."
Finn says: "Well, listen."
Finn says: "I know you don't know us, sir, but we need to talk."
Finn says: "It's pretty important, actually—"
Party Pat says: "Shhh-sh-sh-sh-shhhh."
Party Pat says: "You know who I am?"
Finn says: "You're Party Pat?"
Party Pat says: "I'm the chief."
Finn says: "Riiiight..."
Finn says: "right."
Jake says: "You're the chief."
Party Pat says: "Shhhh..."
Party Pat says: "before you talk to the chief, you must party with the chief."
Finn says: "But—"
Finn says: "!"
Party Pat says: "It is the only way."
Montage begins with Finn, Jake, and Party Pat getting some drinks, watching Party Pat break dance, eating pancakes, and signing "Bears." The montage ends, the bears cheer, and Finn and Jake pant trying to catch their breath.
Jake says: "Dude, we've been partyin' for hours."
Finn says: "Yeah, he keeps drinking those honey-flavored energy drinks."
They see Party Pat getting another three drinks.
Finn says: "How's your nausea?"
Jake says: "Full-blown."
Finn says: "Hang in there, pal."
Finn says: "Hey, Party Pat."
Finn says: "You're the chief, and I totes respect that..."
Finn says: "but what we have to tell you is really important."
Finn says: "And you said if we partied, we could talk."
Party Pat says: "But you haven't been partying."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Party Pat says: "You move to music, but that's not dancing."
Party Pat says: "You chew pancakes, but you're not tasting."
Party Pat says: "To truly party, one must leave behind the problems that are troubling  You can stay in our cave as long as you want."
Finn says: "That's what I've been trying to tell you, man!"
Finn says: "This isn't a cave—"
Finn says: "y'all are partyin' in a monster's BELLY!"
Party Pat says: "Oh, yeah."
Party Pat says: "That makes sense."
Party Pat says: "It's definitely the weirdest cave I've ever seen."
Party Pat says: "Heh heh."
Finn says: "So..."
Finn says: "you'll tell everyone to leave?"
Party Pat says: "Nah, we love it here."
Finn says: "But you're all gonna die if you stay!"
Party Pat says: "So..."
Party Pat says: "apparently we're not in a cave."
Bears murmur "What did he say? I always thought we were in a cave".
Party Pat says: "We're in a..."
Party Pat says: "MONSTER'S BELLY!"
Bears resume dancing.
Finn frowns and Jake wraps his arm around him and rubs his forehead to comfort him. They walk into the monster's mouth and look out at the sunset.
Jake says: "It's kinda peaceful."
The monster is shown sitting on the edge of a cliff looking sad.
Finn says: "All those bears..."
Finn says: "are gonna turn into the stuff."
Jake says: "Shh."
Jake says: "Seriously?"
Jake says: "The only foreseeable threat might be all these trees being swallowed, but they're not hurtin' nothin'."
Finn says: "Yeah, good thing he isn't swallowing some deadly volcano lava."
Finn says: "That would kill them for sure."
The monster stands up and starts walking towards a volcano.
Finn says: "Whoaa."
Jake says: "Whoaa."
Finn says: "The monster is headed toward that volcano!"
Monster says: "Uh-huh."
Finn says: "We gotta warn the bears!"
They run back to the party where the bears are still dancing.
Finn says: "If we bum everyone out, maybe they'll listen to us."
Jake says: "Oh, okay."
Finn and Jake climb onstage and take two microphones.
Finn says: "Just follow my lead."
They sing "The Stuff Song" as the bears dance more and more slowly and eventually stop.
Finn says: "You bears gotta get outta here or you're all gonna be melted by lava!"
Lava starts creeping into the room and bears scream.
Finn says: "Party Pat, do you know of another exit?"
Party Pat says: "Well, there's the dark and mysterious mine, but nobody uses it anymore."
Bears snicker.
Finn says: "He must be talkin' about the butt intestines!"
Finn says: "C'mon, Jake, we gotta get outta here!"
Jake says: "Ehhhhh."
Finn, Jake, Party Pat, and all the bears start running away from the lava. They approach an opening and look back to see the lava following close behind.
The scene cuts to Finn getting a band-aid ready for application with several burns on his clothes and body.
Finn says: "One more bandage."
Finn puts band-aid on a bear. The camera zooms, showing all the bears with burns, bandages, or crutches.
Finn says: "Huzzah!"
Finn says: "The party bears are safe, Party Pat."
Finn says: "Y'all can party out here now."
Bears complain.
Party Pat says: "No."
Party Pat says: "To survive, my people need a phat party club to grind in."
Party Pat says: "That monster's gut was totally excellent."
Jake says: "You're sick, Party Pat."
Jake says: "I'm gonna go watch TV."
Finn says: "Hmmm."
Monster says: "Ohh..."
Finn says: "Pat, he's not gonna let you back in his mouth."
Finn says: "You scorched it all up with fireworks!"
Finn says: "Unless..."
Finn says: "Party Pat!"
Finn says: "Party..."
Finn says: "pancakes."
Party Pat says: "with gentle lasers!"
Bears cheer and take out lasers, shining them at the sky. The monster puts them in his mouth and swallows them. He opens his mouth and lasers shoot out. He gives Finn a thumbs-up.
Finn says: "Hey, Jake."
Finn says: "Wait up!"
Episode ends.
