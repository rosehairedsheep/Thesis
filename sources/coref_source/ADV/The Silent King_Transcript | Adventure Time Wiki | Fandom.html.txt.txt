Jake says: "All right, man, how do we do this?"
Finn says: "Hmmmmmmm."
They start running.
Jake says: "What if they figure it out?"
Finn says: "No way, man."
Back at the castle they put a box over Whisper Dan's head to make him look like Finn.
Gummy says: "I'm going to be honest with you, king Finn."
Gummy says: "When I'm scared, I feel most safe in your lap."
Meanwhile, Finn and Jake join the goblin soldiers facing the army of Earclopses.
Xergiok says: "Line up for you spankings, goblins!"
One goblin says: "Ohhhhh, too late—"
One goblin says: "in my pants."
Finn says: "Jake, the goblins can't see me being unkingly."
Finn says: "I need a disguise."
Jake says: "Jump in my mouth."
Xergiok says: "Who among you has the courage to face Xergiok?"
Finn says: "Shut your kissin' hole, Xergiok!"
Finn says: "It's time for a beatin'."
Xergiok says: "I salute you, foolish warrior!"
Xergiok says: "You can be my personal sla—"
Xergiok says: "How in the world?"
Finn says: "Dude, no one uses Earclopses in a battle without earplugs."
Gummy says: "Oh, great king, with the help of a brave soldier, you thwarted the evil Xergiok."
Goblins says: "Hurrah!!!"
Finn says: "C'mon, dude, lets get out of here."
Finn says: "Well, looks like they got the king they wanted, buddy."
Jake says: "Yep."
Finn says: "And we're going home to adventure."
Jake says: "Mmhmm."
