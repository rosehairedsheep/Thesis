Flame Princess slaps Finn, leaving a hand-shaped burn mark on his face.
Flame Princess says: "Don't ever mess with me again!"
Flame Princess shoots out the window in a trail of fire.
Finn says: "Who was that?"
Jake says: "The Princess of the Fire Kingdom?"
Finn says: "Dude, I think I have a crush."
Finn walks in front of Jake.
Finn says: "What do you know about her, Jake?"
Jake says: "I was trying to help you get over your Princess Bubblegum sad times by hooking you two up."
Jake says: "But she's evil, man!"
Finn says: "You shut your dirty mouth!"
Jake says: "Dirty?"
Jake says: "Oh."
Jake says: "No, really man!"
Jake says: "Her dad said she was evil!"
Finn says: "Naw, man, I peeped beyond her burning gaze, and noshed hot lunch with her soul."
Finn says: "She ain't evil."
Finn says: "She's passionate."
Finn says: "Help me track her down."
Jake says: "Hmmm.."
Finn says: "C'mon, man, I really like her."
Finn says: "Help me out."
Finn says: "Jake, Jake help me out."
Finn says: "Help me out."
Finn says: "Jake, Jake, help me."
Finn says: "Jake, Jake, help me!"
Jake says: "Eeeeeeeeehhh, ok."
Finn says: "Whoo!"
Finn says: "Alright!"
The scene cut to Jake walking over trees as a giant with Finn on his head.
Jake says: "You sure you're not into any other princesses?"
Jake says: "What about Wildberry Princess?"
Jake says: "She's small and plump."
Jake says: "You could sleep on her like a pillow."
Jake says: "Could be nice."
Light shines on Finn and Jake as a burning bird flies away.
Finn says: "Is that bird..."
Finn says: "smoking?"
Brown Bird says: "Hey, don't you judge me."
Brown Bird says: "It was that fire chick down there that done this to me."
Jake stretches down the bushes as he and Finn hide behind them. They see Flame Princess touching flowers and burning them.
Flame Princess says: "Oh."
The fire burns other flowers, spreading towards a lake.
Finn says: "Oh, Jake..."
Finn says: "look at her."
Finn says: "She's innocent."
Finn says: "Like the steam off a puppy's nose, searching for ham in the snow."
Jake says: "Guy drops one piece of ham in the snow and he never hears the end of it!"
Jake says: "Snap out of it!"
Jake says: "She's burning cute little flowers!"
Finn says: "Yeah, she is like a cute little flower."
Flame Princess walks towards the lake, kneels and dips her hand in it.
Flame Princess says: "Aaahh!"
Finn says: "Oh, no, are you ok?"
Finn says: "I..."
Finn says: "I was just worried about you."
Flame Princess says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Look, I'm sorry about what I said before."
Finn says: "I don't know what happened, but I just, I had to see you again."
Finn says: "And, I don't know.."
Finn says: "I don't know anything about you,  but I just, I really like you."
Finn says: "You know, you're so..."
Finn says: "beautiful."
Flame Princess glows brightly.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn stomps on fire, but stops when he sees Flame Princess reacting with pain.
Flame Princess says: "Ah!"
Finn stomps on fire again.
Flame Princess says: "Ow!"
Finn says: "Oh, Glob."
Finn says: "Am I hurting you?"
Flame Princess says: "Yes!"
Flame Princess says: "That's all you've done!"
Flame Princess says: "Are you trying to hurt me?!"
Flame Princess says: "!"
Flame Princess says: "Is that why you're following me?!"
Flame Princess says: "!"
Finn says: "I'm not followi-- Well, I guess technically I am following you."
Finn says: "Hey, no wait!"
Jake comes out of the bushes.
Jake says: "Finn!"
Flame Princess burns tree. Tree falls down, blocking Finn and Jake.
Jake says: "Hold on!"
Jake says: "Eaoww.."
Jake says: "Toasty buns."
Finn says: "Where are you?"
Finn says: "I want to chat it up with you!"
Finn says: "Oh, we lost her!"
Flame Princess appears as trails of fire then reforms.
Finn says: "Whoa."
Flame Princess says: "I am ambushing you!"
Finn says: "Aah!"
Jake says: "Aah!"
Finn and Jake run around to avoid fireballs.
Finn says: "Hey, I like your fireballs."
Flame Princess says: "Huh?"
Flame Princess says: "Why do you torment me?"
Finn says: "I'm not trying to."
Finn says: "I just like you."
Finn says: "I think I..."
Finn says: "I think I like-like you."
Finn says: "Listen, when I look at you, my brain goes all stupid."
Finn says: "And I just wanna hug you, and sit on the couch and play BMO with you."
Finn says: "I can't explain why, but, I never felt this way before and I think we should be together."
Flame Princess says: "I..."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Flame Princess says: "Rggh!"
Flame Princess says: "Enough."
Flame Princess says: "You should not toy with the emotions of a fire elemental."
Flame Princess says: "You told me you liked me, and you made my flame grow brighter, but then you put me out, which hurt!"
Flame Princess says: "You're trying to impede me."
Flame Princess says: "That must be your purpose,..."
Flame Princess says: "but fire's purpose is to burn, so I'm going to turn this land into my fire kingdom!"
Finn says: "No!"
Flame Princess creates a fire wall as Finn and Jake back away from the fire.
Jake says: "She's headed for Goblin Kingdom!"
Jake says: "We need to defeat this fiery she-beast!"
Finn says: "I can't fight her, man."
Finn says: "I'm still into her!"
Jake says: "Finn, what's more important?"
Jake says: "Your love for that screwball dame, or being a hero and savin' the lives of innocent goblin folks?"
Finn says: "Rrrrhh.."
Finn says: "Being a hero."
Jake says: "Alright, c'mon!"
Jake says: "Let's go build fire-proof suits."
Scene cuts to the Tree Fort's garage.
Finn says: "Uh-uh-uh, I gotta' get back to her."
Jake says: "Dude, slow down or your fire suit will be junk."
Neptr says: "Jake, you've found Neptr!"
Neptr says: "I am the ultimate hide-and-seek champion!"
Neptr says: "15 months, 4 days, 9 hours and you guys did not find me!"
Neptr says: "Hahahaha-hahaha."
Jake says: "Oh, plops, we forgot about the game."
Finn says: "Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh..."
Neptr says: "I missed you, creator."
Neptr says: "To count to 100 while you hide?"
Neptr says: "1, 2,.."
Finn halts Neptr.
Finn says: "Neptr, will you help us build fire-proof suits?"
Neptr raises his arm.
Neptr says: "You cannot tell but I am giving a thumbs up."
Neptr raps "Working for the Master" as he builds Finn and Jake fire-proof suits while the two assist him.
Neptr says: "I am finished!"
The scene cuts to Finn flying with his suit.
Finn says: "I sure hope Flame Princess is okay."
Neptr says: "Haha, we are as one, creator."
Finn says: "Jake, you think Flame Princess is okay?"
Jake rises up as Finn spins to avoid Jake.
Jake says: "DUUUUDE!"
Jake says: "I feel like I can touch the heavens!"
Jake says: "And sock angels!"
Finn says: "We're coming up on the Goblin Kingdom."
Finn and Jake fly above trails of fire as they see the kingdom.
Finn says: "There she is."
Flame Princess shoots fire on houses.
Finn says: "She seems okay."
Goblin says: "AAAAHH!"
Goblin says: "Wood for sale!"
Goblin says: "Wood on fire for sale!"
Flame Princess shoots out two lines of fire and turns around.
Flame Princess says: "It's really starting to come together."
Flame Princess says: "Needs more..."
Flame Princess says: "fire..."
Flame Princess says: "hmm."
Finn says: "Flame Princess!"
Flame Princess turns.
Finn says: "Listen, you gotta stop burning the Goblin Kingdom,..."
Finn says: "but I don't wanna fight you or hurt you, I swear."
Flame Princess says: "I've heard this all before."
Flame Princess says: "You..."
Flame Princess says: "MEANIE!"
Goblin says: "My cart."
Goblin says: "I was born in that cart!"
Flame Princess says: "Ah!"
Finn says: "Aah!"
Finn says: "Jake didn't mean that!"
Flame Princess shoots a stream of fire at a building.
Jake says: "Oh..."
Flame Princess says: "Ah!"
Flame Princess says: "Whyyyy?!"
Flame Princess says: "!"
Finn says: "No, Jake, stop."
Finn says: "You're hurting her!"
Neptr says: "I will solve this, creator."
Neptr says: "I will extinguish her using our suit!"
Neptr says: "Foam blaster."
Neptr says: "Hold still, burning lady."
Neptr turns the suit around and aims the blaster at Flame Princess.
Finn says: "Wha?"
Neptr says: "Locked on target."
Finn says: "No, Neptr!"
Neptr says: "Yes, creator."
Finn turns the suit around, before the blaster fires.
Finn says: "NOOOO!"
The blaster hits Flame Princess's fire.
Flame Princess says: "AH!"
Finn says: "I'm sorry!"
Neptr lowers the right arm down, hitting Jake with foam as his suit is covered by it.
Flame Princess says: "That is the last time you hurt me."
Flame Princess says: "RAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!"
Finn says: "My bad, Jake!"
Finn says: "Turn it off, Neptr!"
Finn turns to look at Flame Princess.
Neptr says: "Oh, my..."
Flame Princess turns around and burns the whole city.
Finn says: "NO!"
Flame Princess says: "RAAAAAAAAAHH!"
Finn says: "No more..."
Finn says: "No more!"
Finn says: "FLAME PRINCESS!"
Flame Princess walks away.
Finn says: "I can't fight her,..."
Finn says: "but I can't let her destroy the city..."
Finn says: "I've failed everyone."
Neptr turns.
Neptr says: "Not true, creator."
Neptr says: "You haven't failed Neptr."
Neptr says: "Even if everyone burns, you'll still have me, creator."
Finn looks at Jake, who is moving his own suit's limbs. Jake takes a scoop of the foam and eats it.
Jake says: "Mmm!"
Finn says: "No."
Finn says: "Why can't I just like a girl?"
Flame Princess says: "Ow!"
Flame Princess says: "Huh?"
Dives as a fire towards Finn while she shrinks her size.
Flame Princess says: "Oh."
Flame Princess puts all of her fire out.
Finn says: "Wah!"
Finn says: "Did I..."
Finn says: "do something..."
Finn says: "cool while I was knocked out?"
Flame Princess says: "I understand now."
Flame Princess says: "You're a water elemental."
Finn says: "What?"
Flame Princess says: "You're my opposite."
Flame Princess says: "You create water."
Finn says: "What, cry?"
Flame Princess says: "Yeah, you cry and cry all the time."
Finn says: "N-No."
Finn says: "I-I don't usually do that."
Flame Princess says: "That's your power."
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "N-N-N-NO-NO-NO!"
Flame Princess says: "Finn, even if we like each other, we're going to hurt each other."
Finn says: "No, we don't have to."
Finn says: "I can take it..."
Finn says: "I..."
Finn says: "I mean, can't we try?"
Flame Princess says: "You would defy nature for me?"
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "yeah, whatevs."
Finn and Flame Princess hug, Finn tries to bear the pain but pulls away.
Finn says: "Aaah.."
Finn says: "Uh."
Flame Princess says: "Bye, Finn."
Neptr says: "Goodbye, lady."
Jake says: "FINN!"
Jake says: "Oh my Glob, man."
Jake says: "Everyone's dead, man!"
Jake says: "They're all burned."
Jake says: "There's barbecued bods EVERYWHERE!"
Finn says: "WHAAAAT!"
Finn says: "?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Hah."
Jake says: "I'm just kidding."
Jake says: "I saved 'em."
Jake says: "Everyone's fine, see?"
Jake gestures towards the crowd of unharmed goblins.
Jake says: "So."
Jake says: "How'd everything go with Flame Princess?"
Finn says: "She hugged me..."
Finn says: "then left."
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "How did it feel?"
Finn says: "It hurt."
