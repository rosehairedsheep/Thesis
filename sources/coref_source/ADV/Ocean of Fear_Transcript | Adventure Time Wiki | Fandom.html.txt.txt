Pat McHale says: "In the dark recesses of the mind, a disease known as FEAR feasts upon the souls who cannot overcome its power..."
Finn and Jake chase a Fire Newt to the ocean.
Finn says: "Come back, thief!"
The Fire Newt spews fire at Finn and Jake.
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Fire Newt says: "Stop farting on me!"
Fire Newt says: "It's gross!"
Finn says: "You can't just go around stealing boots."
Jake says: "Yeah, and you know the penalty for stealing boots."
Jake says: "It's poots..."
Jake says: "on newts."
The Fire Newt wades into the ocean to avoid Finn and Jake.
Finn says: "He's getting away in that lake!"
Jake says: "Dude, that isn't a lake."
Jake says: "That's an ocean."
Jake stretches and heads towards the ocean, a poot following behind, barking.
Finn says: "Bark!"
Finn says: "Bark!"
Finn says: "Bark!"
Finn says: "Bark!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Huh?"
The hue of the ocean and sky changes to red and ominous music plays as a wave crashes.
Finn backs away from the water as it washes onto land.
Finn says: "Uhh..."
Jake says: "Poots on newts!"
Jake says: "Poots on newts!"
Fire Newt says: "No!"
Jake says: "Poots on newts!"
Finn says: "I'm coming, Jake."
Finn says: "I'll poot on that newt as soon as I'm barefoot."
Finn says: "Uh..."
The ocean turns a red hue again and ominous music plays as a wave crashes.
Finn gasps and rapidly crawls away from the water.
Finn says: "Ow!"
Finn says: "Why is my stomach going nuts?"
A black smoke rises out of Finn's navel.
Finn says: "Ow!"
The smoke forms into a face and laughs.
Finn says: "Wh-wh-wh-Who are you?"
Fear Feaster says: "I am the manifestation of your fear..."
Fear Feaster says: "fear of the ocean!"
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "I'm not afraid of lakes, wells, or rivers, streams, or deep wells or puddles."
Fear Feaster says: "'Cause you're a wuss."
Finn says: "I'm no wuss!"
Finn says: "I'm the hero around these parts!"
Fear Feaster says: "Ha!"
Fear Feaster says: "You're too scared of the ocean to ever be a true hero."
Finn says: "Not true!"
Finn says: "I'm not scared of nothin'!"
Finn charges towards the ocean, screaming, but stops when he sees a wave crash.
Finn says: "I shall conquer my fear."
Fear Feaster says: "Yeah, right."
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "I will."
Finn says: "I'll conquer my fear."
Fear Feaster says: "Of course you will,..."
Fear Feaster says: "Sarcasm."
Jake comes onscreen, panting, and shrinks back to normal when he reaches Finn.
Jake says: "Dude."
Jake says: "Dude, did you see me?"
Jake says: "I was all like womp, and then I was all like take this!"
Jake says: "Womp!"
Jake says: "Womp!"
Jake says: "And then..."
Jake says: "Hey, whatâ€™s wrong with you, dude?"
Finn says: "Jake."
Finn says: "I think I'm afraid..."
Finn says: "of the ocean."
Jake says: "Say what, now?"
Finn says: "I need your help to overcome my fear."
Finn says: "Will you do it?"
Jake says: "Um..."
Jake says: "No..."
Jake says: "I don't really wanna do it."
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Come on!"
Jake says: "I'm just messing with you."
Jake says: "I'll do it."
Jake says: "Hmm..."
Jake says: "Where to start?"
Jake says: "Oh, ok."
Jake says: "I think we should just take a few steps in the water."
Jake says: "You can hold Jake's hand if you're scared."
Jake grabs Finn's hand and starts walking towards the water, but Finn doesn't walk and falls over.
Jake says: "Um..."
Jake says: "Oh it's ok, dude."
Jake says: "I see the problem."
Jake says: "It's just your feet."
Jake walks over to Finn's feet and takes his shoes off.
Jake says: "Boop."
Jake says: "Beep."
Jake says: "Boop."
Jake says: "Beep."
Jake says: "Boop."
Jake says: "Beep."
Jake says: "Boop."
Jake says: "Beep."
Jake says: "Beep."
Jake says: "Boop."
Jake says: "Beep."
Jake says: "Boop."
Finn says: "Don't be scared."
Finn says: "I shall not be scared."
Jake says: "Boop."
Jake says: "Boop."
The water touches Finn's feet.
Finn says: "I'm afraid!"
Finn says: "Ah!"
Finn says: "Jake, get me out of the water!"
Finn says: "Now, Jake!"
Finn says: "Now!"
Finn says: "Now!"
Jake inflates his head and walks Finn back to shore.
Jake says: "Hot jam!"
Jake says: "You're really scared of the ocean."
Jake says: "In fact, you're so scared..."
Jake says: "it gives me an idea."
Jake says: "Let's start a business of being scared of the ocean!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "Ok."
Jake says: "Ok."
Jake says: "I have a plan to get rid of your fear."
Jake says: "We'll start tomorrow morning."
Finn says: "But I must conquer this now!"
Finn says: "I'm not afraid of you!"
Multiple waves crash directly in front of Finn in rapid succession and a single droplet hits Finn's face.
Finn says: "Ok, yeah."
Finn says: "Let's try tomorrow."
The scene changes to Finn and Jake's bedroom where Jake is sitting on top of a sleeping Finn.
Jake says: "Fiiiinn."
Jake says: "Finn."
Jake says: "Hey, Finn."
Jake says: "Wake up."
Finn says: "Morning, Jake."
Jake says: "Ready for me to help you get over your ocean fear?"
Finn says: "Yeah, man."
Jake says: "Cool..."
Jake says: "but I can only do this if you ask me."
Finn says: "I'm askin'!"
Jake says: "Then get ready for my three-step plan."
Jake says: "Watch your troubles melt away with step one!"
Jake punches the bedroom wall and the entire structure breaks apart, leaving Finn and Jake floating on Finn's bed in the middle of the ocean.
Finn says: "Jake, are you crazy?"
Finn says: "This is not an OK thing to do!"
Jake says: "Hey."
Jake says: "Hey."
Jake says: "Come on."
Jake says: "The ocean is your friend, and you got friends all around you right now."
Jake says: "Miles and miles of friends."
Finn says: "You're nuts."
Jake says: "Don't try to struggle, man."
Jake says: "I'll let you out in a second."
Jake says: "You just need to calm down."
Finn says: "Really?"
Finn says: "Ok."
Finn says: "I'm calming down."
Jake says: "That's great."
Jake says: "You're doing great."
Jake says: "Ready for step two?"
Finn says: "Yeah, man."
Finn says: "I can do it."
Jake says: "Alright, dude."
Jake says: "Step..."
Jake says: "two!"
The bed collapses and falls into the ocean, leaving Finn floating inside his sleeping bag and Jake on top of him.
Finn says: "Jake, this isn't a joke!"
Finn says: "It's touching me!"
Jake says: "Let it hold you, man!"
Jake says: "Let it hold you like a child!"
Finn says: "I'm trying to let it hold me."
Jake says: "Control your breathing!"
Finn says: "This isn't working!"
Jake says: "That means we gotta move to step three."
Jake says: "Just don't scream."
Finn says: "W-what?"
Jake says: "I'm gonna push you underwater with my jowls."
Jake says: "Just don't scream."
Jake says: "Don't scream."
Jake pushes Finn's head underwater.
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Don't scream."
Jake says: "Hold your breath, Finn."
Jake says: "You got it, dude!"
Finn screams and bursts out of his sleeping bag, sending Jake flying into the water.
Finn jumps onto Jake's head and starts pounding on him.
Finn says: "Get me away, Jake!"
Finn says: "Now, Jake!"
Finn says: "Now!"
Finn says: "Right now!"
Finn says: "Get-Get me away!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "Stop it, Finn!"
Jake says: "Ow!"
Finn grabs Jake's ears and stretches them until they catch wind and carry both Finn and Jake to an island of pre-war ruins.
Finn says: "I'm safe!"
Finn says: "I'm safe!"
Finn says: "How'd I do?"
Jake says: "I think we should give up."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "I made it all the way to level three."
Jake says: "Look, Finn."
Jake says: "It's not that I don't want to help you..."
Jake says: "I just don't wanna get beat up anymore."
Jake says: "I mean this  is my bread and butter."
Jake says: "I can't have you messing up my bread and butter, dude."
Finn says: "You have to help me."
Finn says: "I can't do this without you."
Jake says: "Ok."
Jake says: "Fine..."
Jake says: "but only if you swear not to hit me anymore."
Finn says: "I swear I won't hit you anymore."
Jake says: "And also swear to only speak in rhymes."
Jake says: "Speak in rhymes all the times."
Finn says: "I swear..."
Finn says: "and pigs have hair."
Jake says: "Yes."
Jake says: "Perfect."
Jake says: "And since you want more..."
Jake says: "it's time for step four."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "I thought you said it was a three step plan..."
Finn says: "man."
Jake says: "I'm not that good at counting."
Jake says: "Come on."
Jake says: "Let's go kick your fear of the ocean where the sun don't shine..."
Jake says: "in the sea cucumber."
The scene changes to underwater where Finn and Jake are heading to the ocean floor in the submarine.
Jake says: "Check it, dude."
Jake says: "One hundred percent awesome-itude."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "It's pretty math..."
Finn says: "you psychopath."
Jake says: "You know, it looks way more math if you open up your eyes."
Finn says: "Whoa..."
Jake says: "See, man?"
Jake says: "The ocean is beautiful."
Jake says: "There's no reason to be afraid of things that are beautiful."
Finn says: "Hey."
Finn says: "This isn't that bad."
Finn says: "I'm actually glad."
Jake says: "Hey, look!"
Jake says: "A black abyss!"
Jake says: "Let's go check it out..."
Jake says: "sauerkraut."
Finn says: "No, Jake!"
Finn says: "Turn around!"
Finn says: "Turn around!"
Finn sees the Fear Feaster's face appear in front of the abyss.
Finn says: "Noooo!"
Jake says: "Saying, "Turn around" twice doesn't count as a rhyme, dude."
Finn pushes Jake away from the submarine controls.
Jake says: "Hey, you swore!"
Finn pummels Jake.
Jake says: "Ow!"
Jake says: "My bread and butter!"
Finn grabs the controls and jerks them violently.
Jake says: "No, dude!"
Jake says: "Don't!"
The submarine moves wildly and launches torpedoes, one of which hits a building.
The building topples and hits the submarine, causing it to start filling up with water.
Jake says: "Don't worry, dude."
Jake says: "Everything's cool."
Jake says: "This is the perfect segue into level five."
Jake says: "Here, put this on."
Finn starts putting on the suit.
Jake says: "Just make sure you don't pull the emergency tab."
Finn pulls the emergency tab.
Jake says: "No, dude!"
Jake says: "I said don't..."
Finn's suit expands rapidly and knocks Jake back, hitting his head against a valve and knocking him out.
Finn floats to the surface and watches Jake descend into the abyss along with the broken submarine.
Finn says: "Jake?"
Finn says: "Jaaaaaake!"
Finn reaches the surface and jumps onto a buoy.
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "You're right."
Fear Feaster says: "What?"
Fear Feaster says: "Really?"
Fear Feaster says: "You think I'm right?"
Fear Feaster says: "Well, that's..."
Fear Feaster says: "that's great!"
Finn says: "If my body won't let me rescue my best friend, then there's only one thing left to do."
Finn removes his helmet, hits himself on the head with the wrench and falls into the ocean.
Fear Feaster says: "No."
Fear Feaster says: "Wait."
Fear Feaster says: "No!"
Fear Feaster says: "Noooo!"
Finn lands on the ocean floor and wakes up next to Jake.
Jake groans.
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Wake up!"
Jake opens his eyes.
Finn says: "You ok, dude?"
Jake says: "Yeah, man."
Jake says: "Wait..."
Jake says: "Finn, you did it!"
Jake says: "You conquered your fear!"
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "You're at the bottom of the ocean!"
Finn screams and tries to pull his emergency tab, but nothing happens.
Jake says: "Maybe we should celebrate on land."
Jake grabs Finn and pulls his own emergency tab, so they both float to the surface.
Finn and Jake run onto the beach and fall backwards.
Jake says: "I'm proud of you man."
Jake says: "You did it!"
Finn says: "Thanks, dude."
Fear Feaster comes out of Finn's navel.
Fear Feaster says: "You've nothing to be proud of, boy!"
Fear Feaster says: "You will never get of your fear of the ocean!"
Jake says: "Whoa, dude!"
Jake says: "What's with your bellybutton?"
Finn says: "What the flip, man?"
Finn says: "I just swam to the bottom!"
Fear Feaster says: "No you didn't, cheater!"
Fear Feaster says: "You just sank to the bottom."
Fear Feaster says: "You will never be a great hero."
Finn says: "He's right."
Finn says: "I'll never be a hero."
Finn's stomach rumbles and a black-smoke limousine comes out of him and parks nearby.
The limousineâ€™s windows roll down and Three Wise Men come out.
Wise Man 1 says: "Finn, you are wrong."
Wise Man 1 says: "The mark of a great hero is his flaw."
Fear Feaster says: "You know nothing, Wise Men!"
Wise Man 1 says: "Silence, Fear Feaster!"
Wise Man 1 says: "We know a lot!"
Finn says: "Wait..."
Finn says: "Why did you wait so long to tell me?"
Wise Man 1 says: "Because the limo driver's flaw is being late!"
Limo Driver says: "Sorry."
Wise Man 1 says: "Farewell, Finn."
Wise Man 1 says: "You truly are the greatest hero of Ooo."
The Wise Men go back inside the limo and then the limo drives back into Finn.
Finn says: "It's time for you to go away, Fear Feaster!"
Fear Feaster says: "What?"
Fear Feaster says: "Am I supposed to live in your tummy for the rest of my life?"
Finn says: "Everybody has a flaw..."
Finn says: "and it looks like yours is smelling like my nasty guts."
Fear Feaster heads back into Finn's stomach.
Fear Feaster says: "Wonderful..."
Pat McHale says: "And so fear is forced deep within the soul of a hero."
Pat McHale says: "Conquered..."
Pat McHale says: "at least, for now..."
The episode ends.
