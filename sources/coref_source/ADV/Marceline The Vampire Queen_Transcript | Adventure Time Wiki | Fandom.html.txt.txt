Marceline says: "Come on, Marce."
Marceline says: "It'll only hurt for a second."
Marceline is sitting in the shade of a lone tree in a desert. Her umbrella lies just out of reach in the sunlight.
Marceline says: "That's nothing in the face of eternity."
She pokes her fingertips out of the shade. They sizzle and burn.
Marceline says: "But only for a moment."
She tries three more times, shrieking each time her fingers burn.
Marceline says: "Wait."
Marceline says: "I have an even better idea."
Marceline says: "Hmm!"
Marceline says: "I have exactly enough to reach my umbrella."
Just then, a gust of wind blows the umbrella away. Marceline does a double face-palm.
Bubblegum says: "You really like chopping wood, huh?"
Peppermint Butler says: "I'm not chopping wood."
Peppermint Butler says: "I made a toothpick from the ancient elm."
Peppermint Butler says: "See?"
Marceline says: "Uh, knock, knock."
Bubblegum says: "What the dip, Marceline?"
Marceline says: "Sorry."
Marceline says: "It was supposed to be a joke."
Marceline says: "Actually, I have something really serious to ask."
Marceline says: "I want you to do the procedure, the one we talked about."
Bubblegum says: "I'm sorry, but I don't think you'd make a good blonde."
Marceline says: "No, not that."
Marceline says: "I don't want to be a vampire anymore."
Bubblegum says: "Oh, my globness."
Marceline says: "You said you were working on a cure, right?"
Bubblegum says: "Well, the machine is built and the serums are ready, but are you sure you want to do this?"
Marceline says: "I'm sure."
Marceline says: "Some bad things happened to me when I was little."
Marceline says: "When I became a vampire, I was just a messed-up kid."
Marceline says: "Now it's 1,000 years later, and I'm still messed up."
Marceline says: "I don't want to spend eternity like this, with this emptiness."
Marceline says: "I want to grow up."
Bubblegum says: "Okay."
Bubblegum says: "Let's do this."
Bubblegum says: "This means someday you'll die."
Bubblegum says: "You know that, right?"
Marceline says: "I guess that will be my last adventure."
Bubblegum says: "Marceline I'm so very, very, very excited to test my new lab out on you."
Marceline says: "Well, don't get all sentimental on me."
Bubblegum says: "Come on over here."
Bubblegum says: "You know I care about you."
Bubblegum says: "I think you're making the right choice."
Bubblegum says: "Your natural life spend is going to be richier and fuller than you can imagine."
Bubblegum says: "And someday, when you die, I'll be the one who puts you in the ground."
Bubblegum says: "But, you know, this operation might not even work."
Marceline says: "Whooooooooa!"
Marceline says: "This tickles really bad!"
Marceline says: "Did it work?"
Bubblegum says: "Well, I sucked all your vampire effluvium into this bucked."
Bubblegum says: "Possibly we won't know the results for a couple of days."
Bubblegum says: "In the meantime, you need to get plenty of rest."
Bubblegum says: "I'll check your vitals in the morning."
Marceline says: "Thanks, P."
Marceline says: "Brains."
Heart thumping Cow moos.
Marceline says: "No!"
Marceline says: "Huh?"
Cloud Dance says: "It's breakfast time for my sweet babies."
Cloud Dance says: "Sweet babies!"
Cloud Dance says: "Operator!"
Cloud Dance says: "Put me through to Finn and Jake."
Cloud Dance says: "It's an emergency."
Jake says: "Victim's lost a lot of blood."
Jake says: "Clean entry wounds."
Jake says: "It's an expert job."
Cloud Dance says: "Poor miss baby."
Cloud Dance says: "She used to be my best cream cow."
Cloud Dance says: "But now her milk is nonfat."
Cloud Dance says: "And nanette, my beautiful calf is decaf!"
Jake says: "That's terrible!"
Villager says: "Every farm in our village was attacked."
Villager says: "Not a goat or a cow or a duck left un-sucked."
Jake says: "Well, I've heard enough."
Jake says: "Come on, Finn."
Jake says: "Let's go arrest Marceline."
Fat Villagers cheering.
Finn says: "Wait a minute."
Finn says: "We don't even know if Marceline did this."
Jake says: "That's right."
Jake says: "I forgot about Ooo's extensive vampire community."
Jake says: "Come on!"
Finn says: "Yeah, but we need to conduct a proper investigation."
Jake says: "I know that."
Jake says: "Ain't no rookie."
Finn says: "All right, come on."
Finn says: "I'll let you be bad cop."
Jake says: "I'm already bad cop."
Jake says: "Okay, let's not pay seeds."
Jake says: "Me and my partner will "interrogate" the suspect police-style."
Jake says: "Meanwhile, you sharpen up your pitchforks mob-style."
Villagers says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Hey, man, that's not right."
Finn says: "Marceline's our friend."
Jake says: "Physical contact!"
Jake says: "Officer resisting arrest!"
Jake says: "Boom!"
Finn says: "Ow!"
Fat Villagers cheering.
Marceline says: "Ohh, woof."
Marceline says: "Marceline want to go ny-ny."
Bubblegum says: "Don't go ny-ny, Marci."
Bubblegum says: "I'm worried."
Marceline says: "For real?"
Marceline says: "Why?"
Bubblegum says: "Well, the process was experimental."
Bubblegum says: "Like, are there side effects?"
Bubblegum says: "What happened in your sleep last night?"
Bubblegum says: "Nobody on record has ever cured vampirism, unless you count killing vampires as curing."
Bubblegum says: "In that case, you've cured tons, right?"
Marceline says: ""Tons" is an understatement."
Bubblegum says: "That Shnoz was nasty, nasty times."
Bubblegum says: "Hey, cover up."
Bubblegum says: "The sun's hitting the door."
Marceline says: "I'm still undead?"
Bubblegum says: "We don't know yet."
Bubblegum says: "So just chill."
Bubblegum says: "Oh, hey, guys."
Bubblegum says: "How you doing?"
Finn says: "Jake did excessive force on me."
Jake says: "I'm sorry."
Finn says: "Ew!"
Finn says: "Ew!"
Bubblegum says: "Hurry up."
Bubblegum says: "Get in here."
Jake says: "You done it this time, Marceline."
Jake says: "You sucked the life out of defenseless animals!"
Marceline says: "I ain't done nothing."
Jake says: "You think I'm buying that boom-boom mountain?"
Marceline says: "Oh, get some proof."
Jake says: "You want proof?"
Jake says: "Look."
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Proof of how off I'm gonna go if you don't confess."
Finn says: "Yo, chill, Jake."
Jake says: "I'm wilin' out!"
Finn says: "Listen, Marci, I can barely control this guy, and the villagers are getting crazy."
Finn says: "They want to run you over with a wagon, and I'm offering you a way out."
Peppermint Butler says: "Hey, dillweeds, I just swept the place."
Jake says: "Sorry."
Marceline says: "Finn, be real for a second."
Finn says: "All right."
Marceline says: "Look into my eyes, man."
Marceline says: "I didn't do it."
Finn says: "To be honest, it looks like you're not sure if you did it."
Marceline says: "Okay, I'm not sure!"
Marceline says: "Something weird happened last night."
Marceline says: "I had a weird dream about stuff."
Jake says: "Dream stuff always means something."
Finn says: "We'll figure this out, Marci, together."
Finn says: "We promise."
Marceline says: "Thanks, Finn."
Peppermint Butler says: "That's cool, you guys, but clean this mess, also, you bums."
Villager Little says: "He's a gob-gleebin' vampire hugger!"
Villager Little says: "We got to tell the town!"
Villager Little says: "Book it, Terry!"
Villager Little says: "Run, Terry!"
Villager Little says: "Run!"
Villager Woman says: "How long do we have to stay in the laundry house, cloud dance?"
Cloud Dance says: "Until Finn and Jake avert the threat."
Cloud Dance says: "We can't afford to lose more livestock."
Cloud Dance says: "We're struggling as is to keep our kids fed."
Cloud Dance says: "Let's just stay in here until the dirty vampire gets what's coming to her."
Villager Mother says: "But I want to bop her in the nose!"
Cloud Dance says: "Hey, now, it's too dangerous, okay?"
Cloud Dance says: "A small town, we gotta stay close."
Cloud Dance says: "Each of us play a vital role, and I can't afford losing any of you."
Cloud Dance says: "Not you, Clubhouse Sandy, or you, Seed Man, or even you, Sandwich Paul."
Sandwich Paul says: "Sensei Paul."
Cloud Dance says: "Let's leave the fighting to the fighters, okay, Paul?"
Sandwich Paul says: "That hurts."
Sandwich Paul says: "You don't know I teach aikido."
Terry says: "Finn's been turned!"
Villager says: "Wha?!"
Villager says: "!"
Villager Little says: "He does the vampire's bidding."
Cloud Dance says: "Well, there it is."
Cloud Dance says: "Tonight we burn the beast Marceline."
Marceline says: "Woof."
Marceline says: "I can barely stand up."
Marceline says: "Look at this."
Marceline says: "It's my new dance."
Marceline says: "It's called "I got arthritis."
Marceline says: "" Ohh."
Marceline says: "The end."
Finn says: "You should have hung back with P."
Finn says: "B."
Marceline says: "But I've got a bad feeling like you guys are gonna die without me."
Finn says: "Dang, Marci."
Finn says: "Have some faith."
Finn says: "Geez."
Jake says: "Guys, look."
Cow says: "Moo!"
Finn says: "Get it!"
Finn says: "You see it?"
Jake says: "No."
Jake says: "But what's that?"
Finn says: "Must be its filthy lair."
Finn says: "What's wrong?"
Jake says: "Remember how I said my fear of vampires was based on ignorance?"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "Well, I think that revelation was actually based on true ignorance."
Finn says: "So you're scared of vampires again?"
Jake says: "Yeah, man, don't be ignorant."
Finn says: "Come on."
Jake says: "Okay, but I'm gonna hold on to your shirt."
Finn says: "Look at these poor babies."
Finn says: "What's happening to them?"
Jake says: "Y-y-you tell me, m-man."
Cow says: "Moo."
Finn says: "I think they're in the process of being turned, eh?"
Jake says: "Ugh, glob."
Jake says: "Something big just dropped in my gut."
Finn says: "Hang in there, bro."
Jake says: "I can't be here, man."
Jake says: "It's too real."
Finn says: "Wait, you hear that?"
Finn says: "Listen."
Finn says: "There!"
Horse says: "A little help."
Finn says: "Dang!"
Finn says: "Lost him!"
Finn says: "Marci?"
Finn says: "Hey, Marci, you still out here?"
Cloud Dance says: "She's still out here, all right."
Finn says: "Oh, hey, man."
Finn says: "Did you see a scary beast go by?"
Finn says: "I chased it out here, but it got away."
Cloud Dance says: "Oh, we found that beast, and we took care of her real nice You vampire hugger!"
Finn says: "Wait, what?"
Cloud Dance says: "Lookum yonder."
Finn says: "What the blood?"
Fat Villagers chanting "vamp".
Marceline says: "You dumb bumbags!"
Cloud Dance says: "Now look at the other yonder."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Oh, fudge!"
Finn says: "You're sick, man!"
Finn says: "What's wrong with you?"
Cloud Dance says: "What?"
Cloud Dance says: "I'm the good guy here."
Finn says: "You're gonna explode my friend."
Fat Villagers says: "Blow her up!"
Fat Villagers says: "Blow her up!"
Cloud Dance says: "Oh, flip, you're right."
Cloud Dance says: "This is way messed up."
Cloud Dance says: "Run, Finn!"
Cloud Dance says: "You got to beat the sun!"
Cloud Dance says: "Go, Finn!"
Cloud Dance says: "Go!"
Finn says: "Aaaaaaah!"
Finn says: "Marceline, nooooo!"
Marceline says: "Don't let anyone read my diaries."
Marceline says: "Burn them, Finn!"
