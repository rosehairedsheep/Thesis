Princess Bubblegum says: "I can't believe I let you talk me into this."
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's not like I have a lot of free time, you know."
Marceline says: "Peebs, you work too much."
Marceline says: "Imagine a pizza."
Marceline says: "Only half should be business."
Marceline says: "The rest should be personal."
Marceline says: "Personal pizza."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yuck."
Marceline says: "Try to have fun tonight."
Princess Bubblegum says: "With the Ice King?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Not in your everlasting lifetime, girlfriend."
Marceline says: "I wish you'd call him Simon."
Marceline says: "He's actually kind of sweet and funny."
Marceline says: "Can you please try to get along tonight?"
Marceline says: "It would mean a lot to me."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'll try."
Ice King says: "Try anything once, that's what I say."
Marceline says: "Simon!"
Marceline says: "What's this?"
Ice King says: "It's a present."
Ice King says: "To bribe you for coming over."
Marceline says: "You don't have to bribe us, silly."
Marceline says: "We're here because we want to hang out with you."
Ice King says: "No one has ever said that to me before."
Ice King says: "You didn't say, "No take backs."
Marceline says: "Bottoms down."
Ice King says: "So, check it out!"
Ice King says: "I upgraded my home karaoke system."
Ice King says: "Do you like karaoke?"
Marceline says: "Duh!"
Marceline says: "We love karaoke."
Marceline says: "Bonnie is a dynamo on the mike!"
Marceline says: "Okay."
Marceline says: "You guys get started, I'll freshen up PB's drink."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Marceline?"
Ice King says: "Irslerskat prjon!"
Ice King says: "Prjon, prjon Prrrrrrrrrrrrjon!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Marceline!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Get out here quick!"
Marceline says: "What's going on?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Something's wrong with the I."
Princess Bubblegum says: "K."
Marceline says: "No!"
Marceline says: "Simon!"
Ice King says: "Hi, Marceline."
Marceline says: "Are you guys pranking me?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Your friend just majorly malfunctioned!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "He was jerking around all weird, and his voice sounded like he was possessed!"
Marceline says: "Cool out, B-Bell."
Marceline says: "I know you love karaoke, but you can't take it so seriously."
Ice King says: "I hope you like penguin cuisine."
Ice King says: "It's mostly just shapes."
Marceline says: "Who doesn't love a good rhomboid?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "You're a rhomboid."
Marceline says: "Here, Simon."
Marceline says: "I know these are your favos."
Ice King says: "Thanks, Gunther!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "He just called you "Gunther."
Marceline says: "He calls everybody Gunther."
Marceline says: "Bonnie!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "There's something really wrong with Simon."
Marceline says: "There's some wrong with Wait."
Marceline says: "You just called him Simon."
Ice King says: "Call me whatever you want."
Ice King says: "This is the best date I've been on since my last date."
Princess Bubblegum says: "This is not a date."
Ice King says: "Neither was the last one."
Ice King says: "It was a robbery."
Marceline says: "For real?"
Ice King says: "Yeah."
Ice King says: "She stole my heart."
Ice King says: "And my crown."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Your crown."
Marceline says: "Crubs!"
Marceline says: "He's really flipping out!"
Marceline says: "What'd you do that for?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "It just makes things easier."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm definitely seeing some weird activity here."
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's really, really."
Marceline says: "You don't know what's going on."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Maybe I can access it with my VR equipment."
Marceline says: "Whoa, Bon-bon!"
Marceline says: "This stuff is rad."
Marceline says: "Why haven't you shown me before?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I didn't think you liked science."
Marceline says: "I like games."
Princess Bubblegum says: "We can play sometime."
Princess Bubblegum says: "But this time, it's business."
Marceline says: "Whoa."
Princess Bubblegum says: "This is not what I was expecting."
Marceline says: "Did you press the wrong button?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I never press the wrong button."
Marceline says: "Yeah, you always know which button to press."
Marceline says: "I'm referring to the fact that you know how to annoy me."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yeah, I got that."
Princess Bubblegum says: "What I don't get is this stupid scenery."
Marceline says: "At least it's got a pretty killer beat."
Gunther says: "Wow!"
Gunther says: "Two newbies at the same time!"
Gunther says: "How'd you manage that?"
Gunther says: "Yeah, okay."
Gunther says: "I guess if you really squeeze together, it could fit you both."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Who are you?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Marceline says: "Are you a dinosaur?"
Gunther says: "I'm a Gunther."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Okay, what's a dinosaur doing here?"
Gunther says: "I'm practicing my drums."
Gunther says: "The others say the acoustics out here are better than in town."
Marceline says: "What the bleep?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Gunther says: "Yeah."
Gunther says: "That's been happening lately."
Gunther says: "You're lucky you didn't get rearranged."
Gunther says: "Ooof!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Does this circuit look infected to you?"
Marceline says: "I don't know."
Marceline says: "I only deal in infectious grooves."
Gunther says: "Sounds like you guys need another brain."
Gunther says: "I'm gonna take you guys to the the professor!"
Gunther says: "He's the smartest guy I know."
Gunther says: "Next to Master Evergreen, of course."
Sveinn says: "Prjon."
Gunther says: "Hey, guys."
Sveinn says: "Prjon."
Sveinn says: "Hey, Goontz!"
Marceline says: "Who are those dudes?"
Gunther says: "That's Sveinn."
Gunther says: "He only wore the crown once."
Gunther says: "And the guy next to him says he's the first "Santa."
Gunther says: "" Like, what's even a "Santa"?"
Marceline says: "Dude, the Santa?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Nope."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Doesn't ring a bell."
Gunther says: "Aha!"
Gunther says: "There he is!"
Gunther says: "Professor Petrikov!"
Marceline says: "Simon!"
Simon Petrikov says: "Marcy!"
Simon Petrikov says: "Dear!"
Simon Petrikov says: "How is this possible?"
Simon Petrikov says: "Did my beloved Betty master the secrets of the crown?"
Marceline says: "No."
Marceline says: "Bonnibel scienced us in."
Simon Petrikov says: "You must be Betty's little assistant."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Assistant?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I have been my own boss my entire life."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I built my own lab!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I've created freaking life forms!"
Marceline says: "Okay!"
Marceline says: "Actually, I haven't seen Betty since she came back to Ooo."
Simon Petrikov says: "But if Betty didn't send you, why are you here?"
Marceline says: "The crown is going ba-nay-nays."
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's making Ice King act super weird in the real world."
Simon Petrikov says: "Yes, I see."
Simon Petrikov says: "It seems to have infected much of the crown's labyrinth."
Simon Petrikov says: "I was actually just about to follow its path of destruction."
Gunther says: "A quest!"
Simon Petrikov says: "Hey, Marcy, last time, I was so caught up in making things right with Betty that you got left out."
Simon Petrikov says: "I'm sorry."
Marceline says: "It's okay."
Marceline says: "I get it."
Simon Petrikov says: "So, you got a boyfriend yet?"
Marceline says: "Ha!"
Marceline says: "No."
Marceline says: "There was this guy once, but he was a real jerk, so I dumped him hard."
Simon Petrikov says: "Wish I'd been there to punch his face."
Marceline says: "Simon!"
Marceline says: "I can punch my own jerks now."
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's getting pretty bad."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I think we're close."
Gunther says: "Yeah!"
Gunther says: "Can't you hear my intense drumming?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Magic Man?"
Betty says: "Magic Woman."
Simon Petrikov says: "Betty!"
Gunther says: "This is the fabled Betty?"
Gunther says: "I always pictured her more majestic."
Gunther says: "You know, with, guts and stuff."
Simon Petrikov says: "Betty, please, what are you doing?"
Betty says: "I'm re-programming the crown's wish magic."
Betty says: "Got to fix Simon."
Betty says: "A-ha!"
Gunther says: "I'm a bush!"
Marceline says: "It's just on backwards."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Betty's the one who's backwards."
Princess Bubblegum says: "We got to get her malware out of here before she causes irreparable damage."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Now!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Now!"
Marceline says: "Hoo!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Now!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Aaah!"
Simon Petrikov says: "There has to be a part of the real Betty in there somewhere, Gunther."
Simon Petrikov says: "If only I could reach out to her."
Gunther says: "Okay."
Gunther says: "Get in there and reach."
Simon says: "I think I will."
Simon says: "Betty?"
Simon says: "I'm the reason you're doing all this."
Betty says: "I'm busy."
Simon Petrikov says: "Remember how we met?"
Simon Petrikov says: "When we both reached for the same book in the library, and I said you should check it out first?"
Simon Petrikov says: "And when you returned it, you left a note inside, because you knew I'd borrow it next?"
Simon Petrikov says: "It was the funniest, smartest note I've ever read."
Betty says: "I..."
Betty says: "have to work."
Simon Petrikov says: "Betty, I love you so much, but you can't help me like this."
Betty says: "I can and I will help you, Simon!"
Simon Petrikov says: "You remember me!"
Simon Petrikov says: "Stay with that feeling, Betty!"
Simon Petrikov says: "Stay with it!"
Simon Petrikov says: "Betty!"
Betty says: "Simon?"
Simon Petrikov says: "Betty!"
Simon Petrikov says: "I can't believe it's really you!"
Betty says: "Technically I'm a magical A."
Betty says: "I."
Betty says: "avatar derived from Betty's memories."
Simon Petrikov says: "Close enough!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Shwang!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "The system appears to be stabilizing."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Crown shields are coming back online."
Marceline says: "What does that mean?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "The crown will re-seal itself off from foreign entities."
Marceline says: "But I-I can come back and visit Simon, right?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "No."
Betty says: "What about me?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Don't freak out, but you're gonna be deleted."
Simon Petrikov says: "Oh, no!"
Betty says: "It's okay, Simon."
Betty says: "I'm just glad I didn't destroy your world."
Simon Petrikov says: "You are my world."
Gunther says: "Goodbye, freaks!"
Gunther says: "Don't forget Gunther!"
Marceline says: "Bye, dude."
Marceline says: "I'm gonna be nicer to penguins from now on."
Gunther says: "Okay."
Gunther says: "Wait, what?"
Marceline says: "Whoa."
Betty says: "Before I go, there's something I have to tell you."
Simon Petrikov says: "Tell me, Betty."
Simon Petrikov says: "Betty!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm seeing remnants of Betty's program in the readouts."
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's like her data left a shadow print on the circuitry."
Simon Petrikov says: "So, what was that thing you were gonna tell me?"
Betty says: "I just said that for drama."
Betty says: "I figured it would drive you crazy, but at least you'd never stop thinking about me."
Simon Petrikov says: "Betty, I never could."
Betty says: "Mwah!"
Marceline says: "I don't see anything."
Marceline says: "These are just weird dots to me."
Ice King says: "My place is trashed and I can't remember a thing."
Ice King says: "Great dinner party, huh?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Best I've ever been to."
Princess Bubblegum says: "What?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I don't like relaxing; I like science."
