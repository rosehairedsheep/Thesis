The episode begins in the Ice Kingdom.
Ice King says: "Okay, Gunter!"
Ice King says: "You ready for the show to begin?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Gunter says: "Wenk!"
Ice King says: "One, two, three..."
Ice King says: "Heh!"
Ice King says: "Gunter, you cute little dummy."
Ice King says: "You know, Gunter, my song is gonna need some dope lyrics to lure the honeys in."
Ice King says: "Hmm."
Walks to a bookshelf and pulls out a book.
Ice King says: "Jay T."
Ice King says: "Doggzone always says, "Ladies are drawn to bros with tortured pasts."
Ice King says: "" And I've got a way tortured past!"
Ice King says: "..."
Ice King says: "I think."
Ice King says: "I don't really..."
Ice King says: "re..."
Ice King says: "Quickly, Gunter!"
Ice King says: "To the "The Past" room!"
Carrying the penguin, he flies down to the depths of his lair and arrives in a room full of various items. Ah, yes. He opens a drawer and takes out his scrapbook.
Ice King says: "Lot of emotional, powerful stuff in here."
Ice King says: "So where's Marceline living these days?"
Penguin says: "Wenk."
Ice King says: "A cave??"
Ice King flies out of his lair, carrying the penguin, an Omnichord, and a drumset. He's being viewed through binoculars.
Finn says: "Well, well, well."
Finn says: "Looks like the Ice King is up to bad biscuits, brotha."
Jake says: "Bad biscuits make the baker broke, bro."
Finn says: "Ice King, you make our job too easy."
Finn says: "You ready to roll on this fool?"
Jake says: "Dinner roll!"
Scene transition to Marceline's cave. Marceline is strumming her ax bass. She notices Ice King coming in the cave through her window.
Ice King says: "Hello?"
Ice King says: "Anybody home?"
Marceline says: "What are you doing here?"
Marceline says: "I told you not to come around me!"
Ice King says: "Uh, yeah, I know, but..."
Ice King says: "I was hoping you could help me write a song—"
Ice King says: "one that could help me get some princess action."
Marceline says: "I'm not gonna help you pick up on chicks!"
Ice King says: "Ee-yoop!"
He laughs as he flies into her house. Marceline waves Gunter goodbye and follows Ice King. Gunter looks down in disappointment and walks away.
Marceline says: "Hey!!"
Ice King says: "Eh..."
Marceline says: "Get outta here!!"
Ice King says: "Wait!"
Ice King says: "Just let me play you what I've written so far!"
Ice King says: "Is that good?"
The door opens.
Finn says: "Ice King!"
Jake says: "Ice King!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Wha?"
Jake says: "Oh..."
Jake says: "You got 'im."
Finn says: "Nice job, Marceline."
Jake walks up to Ice King.
Jake says: "Your constant harassment of the female gender makes me sick."
Jake picks up Ice King. He and Finn start to walk off with him.
Marceline says: "No, he can stay."
Finn says: "Wha?!"
Jake says: "Wha?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "!"
Ice King says: "Yeah, "Wha?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Marceline says: "It's alright."
Marceline says: "We're working on a song together."
Finn says: "You don't want us to..."
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "for you?"
Marceline says: "No, it's okay."
Marceline says: "You guys can go."
Finn and Jake begin to exit, confused.
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Okay..."
Finn says: "Well..."
Finn says: "I guess we'll see ya, then..."
They look around awkwardly.
Finn says: "Bye..."
Jake says: "Bye..."
Ice King says: "You know, I kinda like bein' tied up in these cords."
Ice King says: "Kinda freak-aaaayyy!"
She immediately drops him.
Scene transition. Marceline plugs in and turns on the Omnichord.
Marceline says: "So what kinda song're we playing?"
Ice King says: "Ooh."
Ice King says: "I brought these  for some inspiration."
Ice King says: "Just use these to work off of."
Ice King says: "Y'know, a template."
She grabs a page. It's drenched in tears.
Marceline says: "Oookaaaay..."
She plays the Omnichord.
Ice King says: "Yeah."
Ice King says: "Yeah, that's good!"
Ice King says: "Keep doin' that!"
Ice King says: "Grod in the sky, please tell me why!!!"
Marceline says: "Stop acting like this!!"
Ice King says: "No, it's just startin' to get good!!"
Ice King says: "Love me!!"
She forces him to the ground.
Marceline says: "STOP ACTING CRAZY."
Ice King says: "I JUST WANNA BE LOVED!!"
Ice King says: "Again, I'm sorry I pushed you."
Marceline walks to the refrigerator and sighs. She then opens it and takes out an apple. Ice King's beard lightly rubs her head.
Marceline says: "Huh?"
Ice King says: "Whatcha got?"
Ice King says: "An apple?"
Marceline says: "nuts."
The Omnichord switches off.
Ice King says: "Hold on!"
Ice King says: "Do you..."
Ice King says: "like me?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Marceline says: "..."
Marceline says: "Of course I do, you old jerk!"
Ice King says: "Really?"
Ice King says: "..."
Ice King says: "Wow."
Ice King says: "Mwah, mwah, mwah..."
Marceline says: "AAAAAGH!!!"
Marceline says: "Not like that!!"
Marceline says: "You don't remember anything, do you..."
Marceline says: "SIMON?"
Ice King says: "What-mon?"
Marceline says: "Why do you even come see me when you don't remember me?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Marceline says: "You don't even know who you are!"
Ice King says: "Yes, I do!"
Ice King says: "I am a lyricist!"
Marceline stares, devastated. A photo lands in her hands.
Marceline says: "Huh?"
Marceline says: "Look!"
Marceline says: "This clipping!"
Marceline says: "This was you, Simon!"
Marceline says: "Before the War!"
The picture portrays a human Ice King walking out of a car ready to deliver the Enchiridion to a museum.
Ice King says: "Huh?"
Ice King says: "Heh?"
Marceline hurries to look for something else. She finds a picture of herself as a child and gasps.
Marceline says: "This!"
Marceline says: "You took this picture!"
Marceline says: "Grr, you've scribbled all over it..."
Marceline says: "Huh?"
Ice King says: "Ooh, ooh, are they good lyrics?"
Ice King says: "I'll get the keyboard!"
Marceline says: "What?"
Marceline says: "Wait, listen!"
Ice King says: "Yeah, let's go!"
Ice King says: "What's it say?"
Ice King says: "Sing out, sister!"
Marceline reads the message again, then stares at Ice King, not sure what to do.
Marceline says: ""Marceline, is it just you and me in the wreckage of the world?"
Marceline says: "That must be so confusing for a little girl."
Marceline says: "And I know you're going to need me here with you..."
Marceline says: "but I'm losing myself, and I'm afraid you're going to lose me, too..."
Ice King says: "Ooh, yeah!"
Ice King says: "Keep it going!"
Marceline says: "..."
Marceline says: "when I don't remember you."
Ice King says: "Wow!"
Ice King says: "I wrote that?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Ice King says: "Hot stuff!"
Marceline says: "What?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Marceline says: "You don't remember what it means?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Marceline says: "Look!"
Ice King says: "This magic keeps me—"
Ice King says: "and I want to save you, but who's going to save me?!"
Marceline says: "and I want to save you, but who's going to save me?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Marceline says: "!"
Ice King says: "Please forgive me for..."
Marceline says: "Please forgive me for..."
Finn and Jake are still in the cave. Finn is looking in the house with his binoculars.
Jake says: "What is goin' on in there?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "I have no idea."
Ice King says: ""..."
Marceline says: ""..."
Ice King says: "Please forgive me for whatever I do..."
Marceline says: "Please forgive me for whatever I do..."
Ice King says: "when I don't remember you."
Marceline says: "when I don't remember you."
As the music continues and Ice King and Marceline sing, "Da da... da da... da da...", the scene flashes back to just after the apocalypse. It looks dismal and there are ruined buildings everywhere. A child Marceline cries. Simon Petrikov returns to her and wipes her tears in recompense for leaving her alone. He walks to a ruined store and grabs a teddy bear. He goes back and gives the toy to Marceline to make further amends, and she smiles sweetly. The episode ends.
