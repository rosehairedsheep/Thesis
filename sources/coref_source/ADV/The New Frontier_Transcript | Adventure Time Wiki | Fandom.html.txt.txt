The episode begins inside Jake's Croak Dream. Jake is floating in space and holding his breath as he sees Banana Man floating. Jake begins floating away from the space ship and is running out of breath. He attempts to stretch his way there but can not reach. His face begins to turn purple and pink and he runs out of breath. The Cosmic Owl screeches and Jake wakes from his dream.
Jake says: "Finn, oh my grosh, Finn!"
Jake says: "It was amazing!"
Finn says: "Whaaaa?"
Jake says: "I had a croak dream, Finn!"
Jake says: "My croak dream!"
Finn says: "Oh..."
Finn says: "my glob."
Finn says: "For real?"
Finn says: "With the Cosmic Owl and everything?"
Jake says: "Mhmm!"
Finn says: "Whoa, a real croak dream?"
Jake says: "Yeah man!"
Jake says: "and isn't that great Finn!"
Finn says: "Yeah, well no I mean, I don't want you to die!"
Finn says: "And where was I?"
Finn says: "I'm your best friend!"
Jake says: "Aww, come on Finn  There's nothing to worry about!"
Jake says: "Think about it, I don't know any Banana Man Finn and rocket ships haven't been reinvented yet!"
Jake says: "I'll probably live another hundred years, easy."
Finn says: "Ummm..."
Finn says: "Yeah, yeah I guess."

Jake says: "Someones downstairs."
Finn says: "I'll take a look."
Jake says: "Who is it?"
Finn says: "It's the Banana Man!"
Finn says: "Shhh!"
Jake says: "What do we do?"
Jake says: "Is he still out there?"
Jake says: "Phew, see I told you today wasn't the day!"
Jake says: "Hey, you wanna make an ice cream pizza?"
Finn says: "Jake, your croak dream just gave us the upper hand, we can cheat now, now we can cheat fate."
Jake is about to take a bite of his ice cream pizza.
Finn says: "We'll track down that Banana Man and crunk up his schemes and save you!"
Jake says: "Finn,  when I die my individual earth conscious is gonna go all everywhere while glob tallies my deeds!"
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "I'm gonna be all around you!"
Jake says: "It's gonna be great!"
Finn says: "Dude, STOP."
Finn says: "SAYING."
Finn says: "ALL THIS."
Finn says: "CRAZY."
Finn says: "NONSENSE."
Finn says: "It's makin' me messed up."
Finn says: "I'm 13."
Finn says: "You're messin' me up."
Jake says: "No one can change your croak dream, Finn, not even you."
Finn says: "We'll see about that, come on!"
Finn says: "Wait, just let him walk a few more steps."
Jake says: "Why?"
Finn says: "'Cause that idiot's about to walk right into the sun and burn up."
Finn says: "And we'll be done with him."
Jake says: "No man, he's walking into his house!"
Jake says: "."
Finn says: "Oh, what?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "He built his house on the sun?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "This guy's insane!"
Jake says: "Finn, did you eat your breakfast?"
Finn says: "No, why?"
Jake says: "Because you forgot how the sun works."
Jake says: "The sun is actually far away, it's not just sitting on the horizon."
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Right on."
Finn says: "Lets chase after him!"
Jake says: "You gotta eat your breakfast man, eat the protein."
Jake says: "Helps your brain."
Finn says: "Yeah, yeah whatever you say, Mom."

Banana Man says: "Huh?"
Banana Man says: "Hmmm."
Banana Man says: "Uh, Uh, Uh, Yeah!"
Banana Man says: "There we go!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Stop talkin' about your croak dream."
Finn says: "It makes me uncomfortable."
Jake says: "Dude, just except it!"
Finn says: "No dude!"
Jake says: "What are you doing man?"
Jake says: "Ahh!!"
Finn says: "Hand me some leaves and twigs and stuff."
Jake says: "Ahh!"
Finn puts the burning leaves and puts it on the arrow tip.
Jake says: "Wait, you're not gonna kill him, are you?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Naw, man."
Finn says: "Ahh!"
Jake says: "Ahh!"
Banana Man says: "Work it!"
Banana Man says: "Ha ha!"

Jake says: "Careful man, I want to be alive for my croak!"
Banana Man says: "There we go!"

Jake says: "Dude, I appreciate why your doing this, but you're not gonna stop from transcend in to Glob world!"
Finn says: "I'm gonna cry man..."
Finn says: "if you say that one more time, I'm gonna..."
Finn says: "Let's go fetch that first arrow to reuse, 'cause we're out of arrows."
Jake says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "No!"
Jake says: "The rocket from my croak dream!"
Jake says: "Oh man, I guess this is it."
Jake says: "I've got to embrace this today!"
Finn says: "Shusher, you're not getting on that rocket!"
Jake says: "You can't stop deatheny, Finn!"
Finn says: "Jake no!!"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "No man!"
Banana Man says: "Huh?"

Jake says: "Finn, let me go."
Finn says: "Please."

Banana Man says: "There's not enough boom boom sticks in the stick hole!"
Banana Man says: "No!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "That's right!"
Finn says: "I wasn't in his dream!"
Finn says: "That means..."
The dynamite is about to explode.
Jake says: "See you on the other side!"
Banana Man says: "Ahh!!"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Whaaa?"
The rocket's bottom breaks off and it tips over.
Jake says: "Am I in glob world?"
The rocket lands sideways and the ground cracks all around and breaks, the rocket ship, Jake and Banana Man falling with it.
Jake says: "Ahhh!"
Banana Man says: "Ahhh!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Banana Man says: "Ahh!"
Jake is holding his breath underwater, which looks like space, and sees Banana Man, the space ship and a model of the earth. Jake is excited as his croak dream is happening as planned. Finn swims over to him, to Jake's disappointment.
Jake says: "Fiiiiiiinnn, don't try to stop me, Finn!"
Finn says: "No, it's okay, I'm here to stay by your side!"
Jake says: "Thanks man, I knew you'd come around."
Finn begins squeezing Jake hard and his face begins to turn red, Jake notices he is running out of air and gets him out of the water, breathing hard, and jumps on Finn, who squirts water out of his mouth.
Jake says: "Take it easy there, buddy."
Jake says: "Poor Banana Man."
Jake says: "So I guess that wasn't a real croak dream after all!"
Jake says: "It didn't really come together quite right."
Finn says: "Heh, heh yeah."
Jake says: "Hey no wait, in the croak dream it was me and Banana Man,  it must be destined to happen again when your not around!"
Finn says: "Well in that case, I'll just have to never leave your side ever again for the rest of our lives."
Jake says: "Hmm?"
Jake says: "What are you doing?"
Finn says: "I can never leave your side ever again for the rest of our lives."
Jake says: "Get off of me!"
Jake says: "No!"
Finn says: "I know where you live!"
Jake says: "No, c'mon!"
Finn says: "Ooh!"
Finn says: "Ooh!"
Jake says: "I know you're not a ghost, Finn!"
Jake says: "Stop chasing me!"
The episode ends.
