Starchie says: "Ahh, Kenneth."
Kenneth says: "Hey, Starchie."
Starchie says: "Glad you could make it."

Starchie says: "Lux in tenebris."
Kenneth says: "Lux in tenebris."
Banana Guard says: "Lux in tenebris."
Nurse Pound Cake says: "Lux in tenebris."
Science says: "Lux in tenebris."
Starchie says: "So, anybody have weird stuff to report?"
Nurse Pound Cake says: "Well, sometimes at night, I see a shadowy figure around Princess Bubblegum's tower."
Nurse Pound Cake says: "I have a feeling it might be otherworldly!"
Starchie says: "Whoa, this is some good stuff."
Starchie says: "We are this close to finally exposing the princess' shady dealings."
Kenneth says: "Excuse me."
Kenneth says: "I believe I've made a startling discovery of my own."
Kenneth says: "I've developed this high-tech device."
Kenneth says: "It broadcasts waves that—"

Starchie says: "Whoa, Kenny boy, you're blowing my mind."
Peace Master says: "So..."
Peace Master says: "a tinkerer, eh?"
Peace Master says: "Fiddling at the fringes of unknown realms."
Peace Master says: "Tell me, Kenneth, will you be ready when the flames of those evil places consume everything you hold dear?!"
Peace Master says: "!"
Peace Master says: "I thought not!"
Starchie says: "Hey, Peace Master."
Starchie says: "Oh!"
Starchie says: "My noodle."
Peace Master says: "There is something very wrong dwelling in the Candy Kingdom..."
Peace Master says: "a dark entity I plan to purge from the face of Ooo."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Uh oh!"
Peace Master says: "Its presence has infected every home, every place of business, even here in this very room."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Whoa!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Holy flippin' flap!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Red alert!"
Peace Master says: "Sorry, I hate evil so much."
Starchie says: "It's all cool, Peace Master."
Starchie says: "Truth sleuths keep it real."
Peace Master says: "Yes."
Peace Master says: "As lone scouts, we may fall, but together we will stand as a mighty force!"
Starchie says: "Alright, Peace Master."
Starchie says: "We'll be ready."
Starchie says: "Mm."
Starchie says: "Dill-icious!"
Peace Master says: "Dun-de-dun-dun-dun, Peace Master!"
Peace Master says: "Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun."
Peace Master's Daughter says: "Finally."
Peace Master says: "Uh, sorry about the wait, guys."
Peace Master says: "Daddy was pontificating."
Peace Master's Daughter says: "Hey, Dad, can we go to the Sorcery and Dark Arts fair tomorrow?"
Peace Master says: "No, honey, that stuff is highly inappropriate for kids."
Peace Master says: "Daddy works very hard to protect you guys from that kind of stuff."
Peace Master says: "If you only knew of the monstrosities that lurk around every corner."
Peace Master's Son says: "Dark Arts!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Right, guys?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "What'cha doin' about it?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Colonel Candy Corn says: "Whoa, be careful about old man naptime, please."
Colonel Candy Corn says: "That could have been it for me just now."
Princess Bubblegum says: "What is going on here?"
Banana Guard says: "Don't."
Banana Guard says: "Hey, watch your pieces, man."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I thought you were gonna whip these guys into shape, Colonel."
Colonel Candy Corn says: "PB, you can't teach a butterfly to bark."
Colonel Candy Corn says: "You know what I'm saying?"
Colonel Candy Corn says: "Say, what happened to them Rattleball boys?"
Finn says: "What was your count?"
Jake says: "Uh, 3 minutes."
Jake says: "What about you?"
Finn says: "Uh, 3 minutes, 30 seconds."
Jake says: "What's that?"
Jake says: "Your invisible watch?"
Finn says: "No, I was just pointing at my wrist."
Rattleballs says: "57 seconds."
Jake says: "Oh, dang, we were both counting fast."
Finn says: "Hey, Rattleballs, are you sure you're waterproof?"
Rattleballs says: "No."
Jake says: "Do you even need to breathe, Rattleballs?"
Rattleballs says: "Continue training."
Rattleballs says: "3, 2, 1..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hey, Peps, where's the tea?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Uh, just a second."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Just leave it out for me."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm gonna go find Finn or Rattleballs or somebody to run down this Peace Master bozo."
Princess Bubblegum says: ""Take my time"?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Alright."
Peppermint Butler says: "Ooh-wah, oooh-wah."
Peppermint Butler says: "My light will move in darkness."
Peppermint Butler says: "I go unseen by low level biddies."
Peppermint Butler says: "Yaaaah!"
Peace Master says: "Whomp!"
Peace Master says: "Almost got me, but my lucky talisman sensed your presence."
Peace Master says: "Look here, friends."
Peace Master says: "The beast lies exposed!"
Starchie says: "Oh, this is a mistake."
Starchie says: "That's my boy, Peppermint Butler."
Peace Master says: "His powers of darkness made me go crazy and crash my minivan earlier!"
Peppermint Butler says: "You need to chill, Peace Master."
Peppermint Butler says: "I'm just a harmless, old butler."
Peace Master says: "Mm?"
Peace Master says: "In you go!"
Peace Master says: "You see this?!"
Peace Master says: "!"
Peace Master says: "My dark wizard gobbler poots evil souls into the void."
Starchie says: "You can't do that to our friend!"
Peace Master says: "Oh."
Peace Master says: "I see how it is."
Peace Master says: "Maybe y'all should get in here, too."
Kenneth says: "Yes!"
Peace Master says: "Impossible!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Time-out."
Peace Master says: "You can't time-ou—"
Peace Master says: "No!"
Peace Master says: "Your dirty hobo birthday tricks won't save you long time!"
Peace Master says: "You hear?!"
Peace Master says: "!"
Peace Master says: "You still here?"
Peppermint Butler says: "Uh, no?"
Peppermint Butler says: "I-I don't know."
Peppermint Butler says: "No."
Peace Master says: "Then hear my challenge!"
Peace Master says: "On the field of wizard battles, armed in my talismans of light, I will destroy you and free my children from the spell you cast over their minds!"
Peppermint Butler says: "I accept!"
Peace Master says: "See you tomorrow, butler."
Peppermint Butler says: "See you tomorrow, momo."
Peace Master says: "Peppermint Burfer, show yourself!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Yeah, yeah, I'm here..."
Peppermint Butler says: "momo."
Peace Master says: "You're the momo."
Peace Master says: "Your spells are no match for my righteous charm sack."
Peace Master's Son says: "Dark arts!"
Peace Master says: "My kids!"
Peppermint Butler says: "You like hunting monsters, do you?"
Peace Master's Son says: "Ha!"
Peace Master says: "Noooo!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Bam!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Now you got a monster kid."
Peace Master says: "Son!"
Peace Master's Son says: "Look, Pappy!"
Peace Master's Son says: "Dark magic!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Remember, you still got two non-monster kids."
Peppermint Butler says: "And if you want to keep them that way, you better toss all your charms down the hole!"
Peace Master says: "I will smite thee."
Peppermint Butler says: "A'ight."
Peace Master's Daughter says: "Whoa, sweet!"
Peace Master says: "Nooo!"
Peppermint Butler says: "One more thing."
Peppermint Butler says: "Show us your underwear."
Peace Master says: "You fiend."
Peppermint Butler says: "Now, um, uh, walk around like a big chicken."
Peppermint Butler says: "Now eat some dirt off the ground."
Peace Master says: "Please don't make me."
Peppermint Butler says: "'Ey!"
Peppermint Butler says: "You want three demon babies?!"
Peppermint Butler says: "!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Okay, stop."
Peppermint Butler says: "I took it too far."
Peace Master's Son says: "Dada, can I go to the park and eat flies?"
Colonel Candy Corn says: "Just look at that sicko."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Where's Peace Master?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Gah, I am freaking out here!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Princess, your chamomile tea."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Whff!"
