Finn says: "Uuf!"
BMO says: "Uuf!"
Finn says: "Come on, Jake..."
Jake says: "Sorry buddy,  just trying to cheer you up some."
Jake says: "I mean here you are chillin' out with history's coolest friends, building an actual pillow fort, but you just sit there sulking--I mean, what gives!"
Jake says: "?"
Finn says: "I guess I'm just thinking about Flame Princess."
Finn says: "I told her a joke the other day and she didn't even laugh or anything."
Finn says: "I guess it's over between us."
Jake says: "That's it?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "A joke?"
BMO says: "Maybe she just didn't get it yet."
Finn says: "Yeah right, BMO."
Finn says: "More like she used up all her laughs on some other guy's jokes probably."
Finn says: "Man, having a girlfriend is hard."
Jake says: "No!"
Jake says: "Being crazy is hard."
Jake says: "You're getting all hung up, all hung up on imaginary problems."
Jake says: "You gotta focus on what's real, man."
Jake says: "Now it's gone forever."
Jake says: "So it's not real, and I don't care about it anymore."
BMO says: "Oh no!"
BMO says: "My favorite window!"
Finn says: "I don't even know what you guys are talking about."
Finn says: "I think I just need some alone time."
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "Festering is always bad, man!"
Jake says: "There's no good kind of festering!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Finn says: "Man, this looked smaller from the outside."
Finn says: "What's this now?"
Finn says: "What the?!"

With Finn's quick slaying of the Blanket Dragon, the Pillow People come out of hiding and greet their new hero.
Pillow people says: "Did you see that?"
Finn says: "Hey, uh, how's it going?"
Quilton says: "Puhoy there!"
Quilton says: "I am Quilton, son of Pillowford, and you have saved our village!"
Quilton says: "You and your sharp pillow."
Finn says: "Hah, it's nothing; I kill things all the time."
Quilton says: "Oh, nonsense!"
Quilton says: "This calls for a celepillowbration!"
The scene changes to some kind of party, where the Pillow People are dancing. Finn goes behind some pillows.
Roselinen says: "There you are, Finn the Human."
Finn says: "Oh, hey there..."
Finn says: "Um, you can just call me Finn if you want."

Finn says: "Oh, uh..."
Roselinen says: "Just kidding!"
Finn says: "Heh."
Finn says: "Oh, uh, your dad seems fun."
Quilton says: "Oh, ha ha, oh my!"
Quilton says: "Puhzah!"
Roselinen says: "Yeah."
Roselinen says: "Um, you wanna dance?"
Finn says: "Oh, well..."
Roselinen says: "Dummy, it's a dance, not marriage."
Finn says: "This place is weird."
Roselinen says: "Are you telling me that birds in your world don't poo little pillowcases?"
Finn says: "Naah, just regular poo."
Roselinen says: "Hey, like this."
Finn says: "Eh, yeah, i-it's really cool."
Finn says: "Where I come from, I live with my best friend, who's my brother."
Finn says: "And he's a dog."
Finn says: "We fight stuff; it's cool."
Finn says: "It's really different than here."
Finn says: "I mean, where I'm from, blankets and pillows are used for bedding."
Roselinen says: "Well they're used for that here too."
Finn says: "Heh heh uh."
Quilton says: "Woo oo ooh hoo hoo!"
Quilton says: "Pill-ightful!"
Finn says: "Ah man, it's been nice, Roselinen."
Finn says: "But I gotta get back to my home."
Finn says: "Quilton, I need your help to find a portal to my home world."
Quilton says: "Of course, we will do our best to help you, Finn the Flesh Pillow."
Quilton says: "But you're not making a fold of sense!"

Quilton says: "Please, share our food."

BMO says: "Oh, there you are!"
BMO says: "You found your mug."
BMO says: "I thought you said you didn't care."
BMO says: "That mug is empty."
Jake says: "I wonder what Finn's up to..."
The scene returns to Pillow World. The presence of Jay and Bonnie, Finn's and Roselinen's children, re-enacting Finn's battle with the Blanket Dragon, is a dead giveaway of the fact time has passed.
Jay says: "Roar!"
Jay says: "I'm the Blanket Dragon!!"
Bonnie says: "Well, I'm daddy!"
Bonnie says: "Sha-pow!"
Roselinen says: "Jay, Bonnie."
Roselinen says: "I bet your dad's just about finished chopping wool."
Roselinen says: "You guys wanna bring him his lunch?"
Jay says: "Yes!"
Bonnie says: "Yes!"
Jay says: "Daddy!"
Bonnie says: "Daddy!"
Finn says: "Oh!"
Finn says: "A pack of fearsome pillow goblins?!"
Finn says: "!"

Quilton says: "Puhoy!"
Jay says: "Grandpillow!"
Bonnie says: "Grandpillow!"
Quilton says: "Oh oh oh, come here!"
Quilton says: "Oh, but I've come to speak with your father."
Finn says: "What is it, Quilton?"
Quilton says: "When you first arrived here, you told us of a mysterious door that led you to our world."
Finn says: "Yes, of course."
Quilton says: "Archaeologists found this in the Pillow Catacombs:  The Pillownomicon."
Finn says: "Oh my glob."
Quilton says: "There is no information about the door, save for the fact it shows up periodically, and then disappears."
Roselinen watches them from the background while their kids are enjoying their pillow lunches.
Finn says: "Quilton, I need to find that door."
The scene changes to the Tree Fort again, where BMO and Jake's favorite cup are wearing rainbow afro wigs.
Jake says: "Uhhh, hey BMO, I gotta snag my mug from you."
BMO says: "Oh, really?"
Jake says: "Hey don't sweat it, I'll make us some hot chocolate."
BMO says: "Jake, you drive a hard burger."
Then scene returns to the Pillow World.
Finn says: "Hello?"
Rasheeta says: "Ah yes, come in."
Finn says: "Are these The Great Abracadabra Mountains?"
Finn says: "And are you Rasheeta the Great Oracle, dweller of said mountains?"
Rasheeta says: "Yes, you must be Finn the Human Man, seeker of the wandering portal."
Finn says: "Yes, I've searched for decades--how did you know?"
Rasheeta says: "I've read it in the Tea Leaves,  this newspaper I found from the future."
Finn says: "Does it say how I get home?"
Rasheeta says: "The real question is: are you sure you want to?"
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "yeah!"
Rasheeta says: "Well don't worry, you won't be here long."
Finn says: "So there is another way to..."
Finn says: "Oof..."
Rasheeta says: "Not long now."
Finn says: "Oh..."
Bonnie says: "Father?"
Jay says: "What did the oracle say, father?"
Jay says: "Have we come to the right spot finally?"
Finn says: "I think so, but the oracle spoke in riddles."
Finn says: "Gonna have to fester on this one for a bit..."
Roselinen says: "Oh, Finn."
Roselinen says: "I know you have to go, all these years I've known, but now that it's time..."
Roselinen says: "when you're back in your real life."
Finn sheds a few tears then strokes his beard.
Finn says: "Hmm, that reminds me, Roselinen, of something Jake told me just before I came to this world."
Shows a flashback of Jake when he was explaining that he needs to deal with his real problems.
Jake says: "You're getting all hung up on imaginary problems, stay with your new wife."
Jake says: "You've known her longer now than any of us."
Jake says: "You're not even sure if I ever really existed."
Jake says: "And I'm pretty sure I didn't look like this."
Finn says: "Come on, everyone."
Finn says: "Pack your things, we're going home."
The scene changes to the real world where Jake was playing with BMO.
BMO says: "Ha ha he, ha ha he, goodness, Jake, why don't you do this with your other babies?"
Jake says: "Well, Rainicorn babies age rapidly."
Jake says: "They don't need their parents a couple hours after they're born."
BMO says: "That really stinks, huh?"
Jake says: "Mmmmm."
BMO says: "Hot chocolate is ready!"
The scene goes to Pillow World again, Finn looks very old, in his bed... and on the verge of death.
Roselinen says: "Finn..."
Roselinen says: "Finn."
Finn says: "Whaâ€”"
Finn says: "where?"
Roselinen says: "Are you comfortable?"
Finn says: "I'm..."
Finn says: "alright."
Bonnie says: "Um, dad..."
Jay says: "That..."
Jay says: "we love you dad."
Finn says: "I remember..."
Finn says: "back..."
