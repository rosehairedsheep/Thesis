Finn and BMO are walking around the Tree Fort with blindfolds on. Their arms are outstretched with their hands clasped together and their index fingers pointing like guns. Their fingers meet and press against each other's. BMO's push past Finn's.
BMO says: "Ha-ha!"
BMO says: "I win!"
BMO and Finn take their blindfolds off as Jake walks in carrying groceries.
Finn says: "Oh, hey, man."
Jake says: "You and BMO play Finger Spread quietly."
Jake says: "I need to get into the zone."
Jake says: "I am ready to receive instruction from the realm of creation above me and the sandwich I am about to conceive."
Jake says: "I am open; use me."
Jake turns on some classical music and starts dancing. He takes a deep breath. The scene cuts to him washing vegetables and then sharpening knives.
Jake says: "Diced boiled eggs!"
Jake says: "Bird from the window!"
Jake says: "Yeah, baby, now we're rollin'!"
Jake says: "Whoo!"
Finn and BMO climb up the ladder to the kitchen.
Jake says: "Common cucumber!"
Jake says: "Sliced Roma tomato."
Jake says: "Sweet yellow onion—"
Jake says: "organic."
Jake says: "this is the greatest sandwich I've ever made!"
Finn says: "Is it glowing?"
The three get up and walk to the sandwich.
Jake says: "You guys want some?"
Finn says: "It's cool, man."
Finn says: "I know you want to eat the whole thing, and I'm cool with that."
Jake says: "Thank you."
Jake says: "Magic Man!"
Magic Man says: "Magic dog!"
Magic Man says: "I'll take some sandwich!"
Jake says: "You stay away from my woman!"
Jake says: "Eh, my sandwich!"
Jake says: "Sandwiche!"
Jake says: "Mijo!"
Jake says: "Magic Man!"
Jake says: "My sandwich!"
Magic Man says: "That's a good-looking sandwich."
Jake says: "What are you gonna do with it?"
Jake says: "Something gross?"
Magic Man says: "It's got my germs, so it's mine now."
Jake says: "NOOOO!"
Magic Man says: "Dead arms!"
Jake's arms become limp and fall to the floor.
Jake says: "Give it back, you animal!"
Magic Man says: "Look, if you really want your sandwich, you'll have to solve my little riddle."
Magic Man says: "When your face shows 7:20, when green leaves turn brown, the only way forward is down."
Magic Man says: "Then you'll see, the wetter, the better."
Jake says: "That's not even a riddle!"
Jake says: "It's wordplay, at best!"
Magic Man says: "You try and come up with something on the spot!"
Magic Man says: "It's hard!"
Jake says: "Ow!"
Magic Man says: "Now to savor the moment."
Jake says: "What the?"
Finn says: "Jake, wait!"
Jake says: "What's he doin' in there?"
Jake says: "Why did he freeze himself with my sandwich?"
Finn says: "He's not frozen."
Finn says: "He's super slow-mozin', motion."
Finn says: "Look."
Camera zooms in on Magic Man's mouth, where some saliva drips in slow-mo.
Jake says: "Aww, that's gross!"
Finn says: "Well, let's go grab it before he hits the ground, which is when I assume he'll take a bite."
Jake says: "Yeah, okay."
Finn says: "Hmm."
Jake follows suit.
Finn says: "Oh..."
Finn says: "hey, Jake."
Jake says: "Hey, Finn."
Outside, the clouds move by quickly, showing that time is only slowed inside the sphere.
Jake says: "How long have we been in here?"
Finn says: "I don't know."
Jake says: "Retreat!"
The two slowly pull themselves out and gasp for air. BMO has joined them.
Finn says: "Whoa, how long were we in there?"
BMO says: "Five hours."
Jake says: "Five hours?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "He's halfway to hittin' the ground..."
Jake says: "which is when he'll bite my sandwich, probably."
BMO says: "Yes."
Finn says: "BMO!"
BMO says: "I agree that is when he will probably take a bite."
Finn says: "You're not helping."
BMO says: "Oh, you need help?"
BMO says: "I can help."
BMO says: "Processing."
Jake says: "Must be his new software."
BMO says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
BMO says: "Ding!"
BMO says: "I have the solution, Jake."
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "BMO, are you serious?"
BMO says: "Yes, this plan will work."
Jake says: "Yes!"
BMO says: "But we have to hurry."
Jake says: "Yes!"
Finn says: "Alright, BMO!"
They run inside, come out with some wood, and start building a ramp. Jake hammers a nail, pausing to look at his sandwich, which is now closer to Magic Man's mouth. Jake resumes hammering at a quicker pace. Finn sets up a camera, as BMO gets to the top of the ramp with its skateboard.
Finn says: "Wait, wait, wait."
Finn says: "BMO, are you just making a skateboard video?"
BMO says: "No, Finn."
BMO says: "This is the plan."
Jake says: "Are you sure?"
BMO says: "Jake, you will have your sandwich back before my board hits the ground."
Jake says: "Okay, BMO."
BMO says: "Yay, BMO!"
Jake says: "He lied to me."
Finn says: "Relax."
Finn says: "I'm calling Princess Bubblegum."
Finn says: "It's ringing."
Jake says: "Okay."
Outside, Princess Bubblegum is using a device to inspect the time bubble.
Finn says: "Thanks again for coming, Prubbles."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Of course, Finn."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Once you explained about Jake's sandwich, I had to."
Finn says: "So, how's it looking?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm picking up major levels here."
Finn says: "Of magic?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Molasses."
Finn says: "Oh."
They start walking over to some Banana Guards holding missiles.
Princess Bubblegum says: "He's using a molasses-based super-covalent subatomic bond, slowing down anything that enters its field, but only if the molasses is at room temperature."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hmm, this one."
Princess Bubblegum says: "My molasses warmer will get things moving."
She moves a level on the missile, causing a smaller missile to shoot out of the bigger missile. She presses some buttons on her watch, and the smaller missile drops an angry bear-shaped bomb, which goes inside the sphere and explodes behind BMO.
BMO says: "..."
BMO says: "iiiiiiiii..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Well, I'm out of ideas."
Finn says: "Who ya calling?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Marceline."
Finn says: "The vampire queen?!"
Finn says: "!"
Inside, Jake has two pieces of bread and a wilted leaf of lettuce.
Jake says: "Oh..."
Jake says: "maybe..."
Jake says: "maybe it's just as good!"
Marceline has now joined them.
Princess Bubblegum says: "See, I think the molasses must be protected by some sort of chemical—"
Marceline says: "Oh, hey, Jake."
Marceline says: "How you holding up?"
Jake says: "Not too well."
Jake says: "BMO looks cool, though."
BMO says: "..."
BMO says: "iiiiiiii..."
Marceline says: "Don't be sad."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yeah, Marceline's got a great plan."
Finn says: "Yeah, man!"
Jake says: "What's your plan?"
BMO says: "..."
BMO says: "iiiiiiiii..."
Jake takes some candles out of the bag and lights them.
Finn says: "Hey, man."
Finn says: "What are you doing?"
Jake says: "I'm lighting these candles so I can move on with the grieving process."
Jake says: "I made them with the leftover bacon fat from my sand—"
Finn says: "I am not giving up."
Finn says: "Let's see."
Finn says: "Who should I call?"
Finn says: "Ice King?"
Finn says: "Shelby?"
Finn says: "Tree Trunks?"
Jake says: "Tree Trunks?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "No, man, don't call Tree Trunks!"
Jake says: "What's she gonna do, bake an apple pie?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Don't you get it?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "It's over."
Jake says: "It's over, and I've never been so sad."
Jake says: "And you know what?"
Jake says: "I got to deal with it."
Finn says: "Jake, look!"
Jake says: "Hmm?"
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "But how?"
Finn says: "Because you've never been this sad!"
Finn says: "That's what Magic Man meant by your face showing 7:20, or as some people call it, a sad face."
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Nobody  calls it that."
Finn says: "Nope!"
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "Don't get judgmental."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Stay sad."
Jake says: "Right."
Finn says: "Jake, every time you get happy, you slow down!"
Finn says: "Stay sad, man!"
Finn says: "Make yourself sad!"
Jake says: "Uh..."
Jake says: "okay!"
He imagines his funeral, with Lady Rainicorn crying over his grave.
Lady Rainicorn says: "제이이이이크!"
Mr. Cupcake says: "It's okay, Lady."
Mr. Cupcake says: "You gotta let go."
Mr. Cupcake says: "He's gone now."
Mr. Cupcake says: "Let me take you out for a coffee..."
Mr. Cupcake says: "get your mind off things."
Mr. Cupcake arrives at Lady Rainicorn's house in his sports car. Lady Rainicorn gets out of the car.
Lady Rainicorn says: "컵케이크 씨, 정말 고마워요."
Lady Rainicorn says: "당신은, 정말 좋은 친구예요."
Lady Rainicorn says: "( Mr"
Lady Rainicorn says: "."
Lady Rainicorn says: "Cupcake, Thank you."
Lady Rainicorn says: "You're really a good friend."
Mr. Cupcake says: "Hey, Lady, I'm here for you."
Mr. Cupcake says: "Don't you ever forget that."
Lady Rainicorn smiles and Mr. Cupcake raises his eyebrows twice.
Jake says: "Hey, Mr."
Jake says: "Cupcake, you stay away  from Lady!"
Finn says: "No, man!"
Finn says: "Stay sad!"
Finn says: "Make yourself sad!"
Jake says: "Uh..."
He imagines Mr. Cupcake at his grave.
Mr. Cupcake says: "I, I love you, Jake."
Mr. Cupcake says: "We should have hung out more."
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "Um, I love you too, Mr."
Jake says: "Cupcake."
Jake says: "I didn't want to hang because I thought Lady was into your muscles."
Jake says: "And I thought if we'd hung out, you'd sweet-talk her and take her from me."
Mr. Cupcake says: "What?"
Mr. Cupcake says: "I would never."
Mr. Cupcake says: "I've got so much respect for you."
Jake says: "Dude, I have so much respect for you!"
Jake says: "I try to be like you in some aspects of my life!"
Jake says: "Look, if something were to happen to me, and I wasn't here anymore, I'd want you to take care of Lady and the kids."
Mr. Cupcake says: "That means so much to me."
Mr. Cupcake says: "I wish we had more time together."
Finn says: "Yeah, Jake!"
Finn says: "The wetter, the better!"
Finn says: "Keep crying!"
Jake says: "I'm sorry, Mr."
Jake says: "Cupcake!"
The sphere disappears, the missile explodes, and pieces of wood hit Magic Man. Marceline then lands on her elbow on him, and BMO skateboards over his face.
BMO says: "Boardslide!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yay!"
Jake says: "I got you, baby."
Jake says: "This sandwich is so good!"
Episode ends.
