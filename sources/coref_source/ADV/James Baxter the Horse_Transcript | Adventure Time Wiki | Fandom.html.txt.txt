Episode opens with BMO walking out of the Tree Fort door and singing a song, an egg is in a cup taped to its chest. As it dances in the large grass area it lifts up the eggs during the climax of the song. Suddenly, a butterfly swoops in and knocks the egg out of its hands. The egg smashes on the ground and BMO gasps and starts crying.
Upon hearing this Finn and Jake run up to see what has happened.
Finn says: "Whoa whoa whoa."
Jake says: "BMO, what's wrong?"
Jake says: "I think he broke his egg."
Finn says: "Hey, it's okay BMO."
Finn says: "Look, Jake and I will make you a funny face."
Jake says: "Hey, BMO, this will cheer ya up!"
After a few seconds of this, Jake releases Finn and Finn breathes grasps for air.
Jake says: "Well, I'm outta ideas."
Jake says: "What?"
Whinnying is heard and a horse balancing on a beach ball arrives. They all stand up to watch him.
James Baxter says: "James Baxter!"
James Baxter says: "James..."
James Baxter says: "Baxter!"
Jake says: "Oh, man, James Baxter is so good, man."
Jake says: "He always knows just what to say to cheer a guy up!"
Finn says: "Yeah, man."
Scene shifts to BMO and James Baxter, BMO is clapping and running after the horse as it continues to balance on the ball and say its name.
Jake says: "So good!"
Finn says: "Man, we should do it to!"
Finn says: "Do his thing and spread the good will!"
Jake says: "Yeah, man, I wanna be like James Baxter, always rollin' in on a beach ball, saying his name in a horse voice, making people smile."
Jake says: "Let's do it!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
The scene is a funeral, four persons stand solemnly. Upon hearing noises they look up and turn towards Finn and Jake, who are in the bushes saying their names in a horse-like voices.
Finn says: "Finn the Human!"
Jake says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "Jake!"
The attendees are shocked and can only look at the two with mouths agape.
Jake says: "Sheesh, tough crowd."
Finn says: "I think we should find an easier person to cheer up."
Finn says: "It was a mistake to visit a funeral."
Finn and Jake jump out of the bushes and run down a hill, away from the proceedings. As the attendees watch they quickly turn back around to see the coffin shake around.
The next scene is the neighborhood area of the Candy Kingdom. A green Lollipop Girl is humming a tune and holding an ice cream cone, but the ice cream drops from the cone and she begins to cry. Finn and Jake arrive once again saying their names in horse-like voice, only this time jumping up and down.

James Baxter says: "James Baxter!"
James Baxter says: "James Baxter!"
Finn says: "Man, what's he doing that we're not?"
Finn says: "We just gotta figure that out."
Jake says: "No, it's like, he's shredding on a guitar and learning how to shred isn't just copying the exact notes as someone else's solo."
Jake says: "You need to learn how to do your own solo."
Back at the Tree Fort, noises are heard. Inside Jake and Finn are making noises, contorting themselves and dancing around. BMO watches them.
BMO says: "Why am I recording?"
Finn says: "You're documenting our creative flow in case we make a breakthrough."
Jake says: "Dude, I think we do got something."
Finn says: "Let's check the video."

BMO says: "Bathtub, Bathtub!"
With clipboards in hand, Finn and Jake sit down to face BMO.
Jake says: "Alright, BMO, play the video."
BMO says: "Who's gonna scrub me?"
Jake says: "I'll scrub,  you take notes."
Finn says: "Yeah, right there, speed it up."
Finn says: "Slow it down."
