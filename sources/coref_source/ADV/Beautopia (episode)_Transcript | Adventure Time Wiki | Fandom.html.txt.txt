It is night and raining outside of the Tree Fort; Finn is sitting at the table while Jake puts on some hot water.
Jake says: "Hey, what kind of coffee do you want?"
Finn says: "Hazelnut!"
Finn says: "Hazelnut!"
Finn says: "What if your name was "Zelnut"?"
Finn says: "And then I would be all like "Hey, Zelnut."
Jake says: "That's terrible."
Finn says: "Hey, Zelnut."
Irritated, Jake grows and gently bodyslams Finn, who laughs.
Jake says: "Nooooo!"
Jake says: "Stop!"
There is then a knocking sound.
Finn says: "You hear that?"
Jake says: "Yeah."
The wall is then burst through by none other than Susan Strong. She stands still as lightning flashes.
Finn says: "Susan Strong!"
Jake says: "Susan Strong!"
Finn says: "?"
Jake says: "?"
Susan says: "Finn, help Susan."
Finn says: "Of course I will."
Jake says: "Excuse us for a moment, Strong."
Jake says: "Dude, you know you're my bro, but that girl is bad news."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Naw."
Jake says: "She's crazy, man."
Jake says: "She's a fish person!"
Finn says: "We don't know that!"
Jake says: "Dude, she tried to eat Peppermint Butler!"
Jake says: "She'd probably be worse if she was so scared of everything."
Finn says: "Whatever, look, she needs my help..."
Finn says: "and I'm gonna help her whether you're coming with me or not."
Jake says: "Oh, I'm coming with you if only to be disruptive and obnoxious!"
Finn says: "Susan, what can we do?"
Susan says: "I need your hero heart and your magic."
Finn says: "My magic?"
Susan says: "Magic of red flower."
Finn carries a flame-light lantern as Susan leads them down the tunnel to the Hyooman territory; down in the Hyoomen tribe's territory they find Hyoomans watching them from behind rocks and litter.
Jake says: "Fish people."
Susan says: "Long ago, my people live in Beautopia..."
Susan says: "but driven out by Lub Glubs."
Susan says: "We come here."
Susan says: "We too scared to fight back."
Susan says: "This why we need your hero heart."
Susan says: "Hyoomans!"
Susan says: "I'll be back!"
Susan and Finn go on their way.
Jake says: "Fish People!"
Jake says: "I'll be, um, a dolphin!"
The trio come to water.
Susan says: "Come on."
Susan says: "We swim there."
Finn says: "No, you don't understand."
Finn says: "I'm not a fish person."
Finn says: "I'm human."
Susan says: "We go."
Susan puts Finn's head under the water and he struggles, Jake tries to restrain Susan by wrapping his arms around her and Finn is able to come up to the surface with his hat on backwards; he takes it off and gasps for air; Jake runs to Finn and Susan extends her arm.
Jake says: "Grrr..."
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "Hey, hey."
Jake says: "What?"
Susan says: "We take boat."
On the boat, Finn hangs the lantern on a hook and Jake sings "I'm On a Boat.".
Jake says: "Oooh..."
Jake says: "I'm on a boat with a couple of wackos."
Jake says: "Shakin' my hips, and dippin' my fat toe..."
Jake says: "In the water!"
Jake says: "Dippin' in the water!"
Jake says: "This party's gettin' hotter!"
Jake says: "It's so hot..."
Jake says: "it's stupid."
Jake says: "So where we headed, Susan?"
Susan says: "There."
Jake says: "Oh, no."
Jake says: "Oh, no."
Jake says: "No, no, no!"
Jake says: "No, Susan, no!"
They go down the whirlpool, and Finn and Jake scream; they pop out safely out of a pipe.
Finn says: "That was awesome."
Finn says: "See, Jake?"
Finn says: "We can trust Susan."
Finn says: "She's on the trolley."
Jake just morphs his head into a fish person's, points to Susan, and makes a "screwball" sign with his arm.
Susan says: "Keeps looking for Lub Glubs."
A pool floaty floats ahead.
Susan says: "No move!"
The floaty floats by.
Susan says: "Whew, we safe now."
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "Dude, she's crazy."
Finn says: "She's not crazy!"
Finn says: "She's cool!"
Jake says: "Whatever, man."
Jake says: "This is a crazy cruise, and Susan is our crazy captain..."
Jake says: "and I'm a crazy clam-shell!"
Jake says: "Woo-ep!"
Jake says: "Oh, doing the clam!"
Finn says: "Quit acting like a clam, you ham."
Susan looks ahead worriedly while Jake dances and opens his clam head to reveal a Birth of Venus-type statuette with his face that dances, a slamming sound can be heard.
Jake says: "Hey, you hearing that too?"
Susan says: "Getting close to the Lub Glubs' mash-'em-ups."
Jake says: "Huh?"
Susan says: "Behold!"
They float up to a series of giant stones coming out of the walls slamming together.
Finn says: "Balzacs!"
Susan says: "The clashing gates!"
Jake's head returns to normal with a look of fear on his face and he look at Finn.
Susan says: "'S okay."
Susan says: "Susan know when is safe to pass through."
Jake says: "Uh-huh."
Jake says: "Finn, let's get outta here."
Finn says: "Come on."
Finn says: "She knows this place."
Finn says: "Trust."
Finn says: "We're ready when you are, Susan."
Jake says: "You know, I could just stretch us over this thing."
Susan says: "Go..."
Susan says: "now!"
They speed through the gates; Jake screams and Finn stays calm; at the last gate half the boat is crushed.
Susan says: "Oh, good."
Susan says: "Still got some boat left."
Jake says: "She's flippin' crazy!"
Jake says: "Come on, Finn."
Jake says: "Let's bail."
Finn says: "Chill out."
Jake pouts.
Finn says: "Alright, Susan, what do we do next?"
Susan says: "Hmm..."
Susan says: "never made this far before."
Susan says: "Just gotta get past Lub Glubs."
Finn says: "Yeah, what are Lub Glubs, exactly?"
Susan says: "They..."
Susan says: "umm, look, they like this."
Finn says: "Hmm."
Jake says: "That looks like..."
Jake says: "my father."
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "Now I'm crazy!"
Susan says: "Yes."
Susan says: "Lub Glubs crazy scary."
Susan says: "Hyoomans scared so long."
Susan says: "Even Susan."
Susan says: "That why glad I meet you."
Susan says: "You have brave heart."
Finn says: "Thank..."
Finn says: "you..."
Susan grabs Jake and squeezes him into an oar and paddles further into the cavern, with Jake gasping for air every paddle.
Jake says: "Oh, thank Glob."
They float close to a dome shaped city as Jake returns to his normal form and Susan puts down both Finn and Jake.
Finn says: "Whoa..."
Finn says: "Ominous."
Susan says: "We's be alls good once bring red flower to city heart."
They float close to the city heart, when out of a store called "FLOATY" a gush of water comes out.
Jake says: "What's making all that swishing?"
Susan says: "Lub Glubs!"
Susan says: "They coming!"
After a moment of tense drama, a pool floaty floats out.
Jake says: "It's just more pool floaties!"
Susan says: "Shh!"
Susan says: "Shh!"
Susan says: "Too many Lub Glubs to fight!"
Many pool floaties surround them, Susan begins to hyperventilate and backs away.
Jake says: "Susan!"
Jake says: "Susan, Lub glubs are just pool toys!"
Jake says: "No more craziness."
Jake pokes the floaty a black monster oozes out of it, and so do all the other "floaties".
Jake says: "Ooooh..."
Jake says: "Jakey beefed it!"
A Lub Glub tries to attack the trio; Susan cowers in fear but Finn and Jake fight them.
Jake says: "Bad news, dude."
Jake says: "There's only two of us and more than, um,  this many of them!"
Finn says: "We gotta use the fire, like Susan said."
Finn says: "Are you okay with that?"
Jake says: "Yes!"
Jake says: "I'm okay with that!"
Jake says: "I'll do whatever Susan says!"
Finn says: "Susan!"
Finn says: "We need you!"
Finn says: "Yeah, Susan!"
Susan makes a break with the lantern but is pounced on by Lub Glubs.
Finn says: "Susan!"
Susan says: "Finn!"
Susan says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "I gots it!"
Susan says: "Red flower!"
Susan says: "Throw it to city heart!"
Jake says: "Finn, win aide to fair Susan!"
Jake says: "Jake brings the fire!"
Jake goes as Finn kicks a Glub Glub off Susan.
Finn says: "Humans and "Hyoomans" got to stick together!"
Finn and Susan bump fists, and Susan grabs his arms.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Susan swings him at a Lub Glub.
Susan says: "Hmm."
Jake stretches up the tower to the city heart; a giant Lub Glub comes out of the water and rise up the tower on the opposite side of Jake.
All of Beautopia becomes lit with flames popping out of torches and pipes; the Lub Glubs evaporate leaving behind nothing but torn rubber floaties.
Finn says: "It's working, Susan!"
Finn says: "Jake."
Jake says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "It is beautiful."
Later, the Hyoomen tribe arrive and sort through things with Jake's help.
Finn says: "You were right, Susan."
Finn says: "This place is great."
Finn says: "Well, we'd better get home."
Susan says: "Finn, you stay."
Finn says: "No, I can't."
Finn says: "I'm not like you."
Susan takes Finn's hand and puts it in her hat, a look of shock envelops Finn's face.
Finn says: "Susan..."
Jake says: "C'mon, Finn, let's go!"
Jake says: "I grabbed, like, 100 soft pretzels!"
Finn hops and Jake paddles them back, Finn and Susan wave at each other, and the episode ends.
