Jake says: "I like your swordsmith hat."
I'm wearing it in honor of my special guest.
Jake says: "Am I your special guest?"
Peppermint Butler says: "No."
Jake says: "Dang."
The sword sizzles as peppermint butler dips it into a bucket of water.
Peppermint Butler says: "This sword will serve you much better than your old, cursed Grass Sword."
Peppermint Butler says: "This sword is also cursed, but it has a compass in the hilt!"
Finn says: "Neat!"
And now for one more thing; The special guest I now will bring!
Peppermint Butler smashes a container of bug milk over a drawing of a phil fac.

Hunson says: "And Jake the Dog!"
Hunson says: "Hey, did Marceline call me-?"
Peppermint Butler says: "It is I who summoned you."
Peppermint Butler says: "I humbly ask you for an infusion of Nightosphere magic upon this sword."
Hunson says: "Okay."
Peppermint Butler says: "I proclaim this blade  "The Night Sword"!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Now to send you back."
Hunson says: "Not so fast."
Hunson says: "It's like I got a free flight here."
Hunson says: "I'm gonna go see my little girl."
Finn says: "Back in the hole, Marceline's dad."
Hunson says: "I'll behave myself."
Hunson says: "No soul sucking, no evil stuff."
Hunson says: "I'm trying to be a better person."
Hunson says: "Maybe it's too late for me, but I'm trying."
Hunson says: "Oh, I'm so ashamed of the things I've done!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Have some dignity, man!"
Peppermint Butler says: "All right."
Peppermint Butler says: "You may leave the circle for one day."
Hunson says: "Wheeeeee!"
Hunson says: "Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Hunson says: "Time to suck some souls!"
Peppermint Butler uses the Night Sword to enchant handcuffs on Hunson.
Hunson says: "Hey, what gives?"
Peppermint Butler says: "Phantom manacles your wrists shall constrain until you're back in your hole again!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Finn."
Finn says: "Let's go see Marcy."
Jake says: "Great sword making, Pep But."
Peppermint Butler says: "Yo, see you guys at the concert!"
Hunson says: "Walkin' in ooo, not suckin' out souls Walk, walk, walk, not suck, suck, suck Walk, walk, walk, not suck, suck, suck."
Finn says: "Hey, could you stop saying that, please?"
Hunson says: "So what's my little monster up to these days?"
Hunson says: "Is she still all goody-goody?"
Hunson says: "Still half-vampire?"
Hunson says: "Started dating anyone?"
Finn says: "Yes, yes, but no, then yes again, and maybe?"
Finn says: "Look, maybe cool it with the prying around Marceline."
Hunson says: "Nah, she loves it when I pry."
Chicle says: "Chuckling mode off."
Hunson says: "You know, now that we're here, I'm having second thoughts."
Hunson says: "It just seems like no matter what I do, I always tick that girl off."
Hunson says: "Marceline!"
Hunson says: "Long time no see."
Hunson says: "Some googoo with glasses summoned me."
Hunson says: "What's that thing?"
Hunson says: "Just gonna put this here, okay?"
Hunson says: "Now let's go suck some souls!"
Hunson says: "I don't know what it is."
Jake says: "Uhh, heh."
Finn says: "."
Marceline says: "Dad, what are you doing here?"
Hunson says: "I'm in town for the week, and I don't really have a place to stay, dot, dot, dot."
Marceline says: "Mnh."
Marceline says: "How many souls did he suck on his way here?"
Finn says: "Oh, I guess like zero."
Hunson says: "See!"
Hunson says: "I made Finn a cool, new sword and everything!"
Marceline says: "I guess you can crash here."
Great! Thanks for inviting me.
Marceline says: "That is not what's happening."
Finn says: "We're gonna jet, Marcy."
Hunson says: "What?!"
Hunson says: "!"
Hunson says: "You just got here."
Hunson says: "Invite them in, Marceline."
Marceline waves them inside.
Hunson says: "Do you have a bathroom?"
Marceline says: "Yeah, there's one upstairs."
Hunson says: "I just have to freshen up."
Marceline says: "Is my dad really behaving himself this time?"
Finn says: "He's just been singing songs and stuff."
Jake says: "Yeah, he seems pretty fun for an old guy."
Jake says: "Hey, wait a minute..."
Jake says: "I'm an old guy!"
Hunson says: "Hey, excuse my unsociableness."
Hunson says: "There's just one thing; The Venetian blinds in your bathroom kind of jumped out at me and got broken."
Marceline says: "How could you wreck the blinds just by going to the bathroom?"
Hunson says: "Let me make it up to you."
Hunson says: "I've got some soy sauce and some ketchup."
Marceline says: "I'm good."
Hunson says: "Here's an SD card, some twist ties."
Marceline says: "I don't want any of this junk!"
Hunson says: "Hey!"
Hunson says: "I'm gonna need a place to sleep tonight."
Hunson says: "Do you have an air mattress?"
Marceline says: "Yeah."
Hunson says: "Great!"
Hunson says: "You can sleep on the air mattress, and I'll sleep on your bed."
Marceline says: "It's in the closet."
Hunson says: "Finn, are you gonna let my little girl blow up that air mattress?"
Finn says: "Not on my watch!"
Marceline says: "Hey, Dad, I think I'm gonna go out for a walk before bedtime."
Finn says: "But, Marcy don't you have a solo gig tonight?"
Marceline says: "Ss-ss-ss-ss!"
Jake says: "I get it."
Jake says: "It's air mattress talk."
Jake says: "Ss-ss-ss-ss."
Jake says: "Aren't you giving a concert tonight?"
Jake says: "Ss-ss-ss."
Jake says: "At the Ghost Amphitheater?"
Jake says: "Ss-ss-ss."
Hunson says: "Concert?"
Hunson says: "It's a good thing your friends remembered that."
MarcelineThanks, Jake.
Hunson says: "Let's go!"
Finn says: "Do you hear, like, a really stupid-sounding laugh?"
Jake says: "Yes."
Chicle says: "I have a nice laugh."
Finn, Jake, Marceline, and Hunson enter the Cemetery.
Chicle says: "Time to blend in completely unnoticed."
Chicle says: "Hey, what you got there?"
Chicle says: "Peanuts?"
Marceline says: "Hello, Hamburger Hills Cemetery!"
Marceline appears in a fog on stage, and the audience cheers and applauds.
Hunson says: "Marceline!"
Hunson says: "You're doing great, baby!"
Marceline says: "I haven't started yet."
Hunson says: "Hey, Pennebaker!"
Hunson says: "No illegal recording unless you're family."
Hunson says: "Yoink."
Hunson says: "Just ignore me."
Marceline says: "Dad!"
Marceline says: "You're wrecking the show!"
Hunson says: "This is my daughter!"
Hunson says: "I am proud of my punk daughter!"
Hunson says: "I made that!"
Jake says: "Sit down, man!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Yeah, you're killing the vibe."
Hunson says: "I'm just explaining my part in all this."
Chicle says: "Ugh."
Chicle says: "This is terrible."
Chicle says: "Boo, I say."
Ghost says: "Yeah!"
Ghost says: "Boooo!"
Hunson says: "Don't worry, honey."
Hunson says: "I'll work the crowd."
Hunson says: "Hey, it's me Hunson!"
Hunson says: "I'm happy to field any questions from you dummies."
Chicle says: "Can you believe Marceline has a bougie trash daddy?"
Chicle says: "I heard this guy even eats ghosts, you know, like us."
Ghost says: "What?"
Ghost says: "Really?!"
Ghost says: "!"
Hunson says: "Sure, sometimes."
Ghost says: "Off the stage, skin sack!"
Hunson says: "Okay, okay, settle down, pal."
Hunson says: "Don't make me come out there."
Ghost says: "What you gonna do "eat my fries?"
Marceline says: "My bass!"
Hunson says: "Come on, ectoplasm comes right off."
Marceline says: "Don't!"
Marceline says: "You wreck everything."
Hunson jumps out into the crowd to attack the heckling ghosts.
Ghost says: "Mad daddy!"
Hunson says: "Hammer fist strike!"
Chicle says: "Let's get him, fellas."
Hunson says: "Ha-ha!"
The ghosts turn red and attack Hunson.
Marceline says: "Dad, quit clowning."
Hunson says: "Uh, just havin' a little fun."
Marceline says: "Come on, Dad, fight back!"
Finn says: "He can't."
Finn says: "Pep Buts bound his powers."
Marcline says: "What?!"
Marcline says: "!"
Hunson says: "They sassed you."
Finn says: "Better pop that cork, Peps."
Peppermint Butler says: "All right."
Peppermint Butler says: "All right."
Chicle throws a peanut at peppermint butler's head, which knocks him to the ground.
Chicle morphs back into his original form.
Finn says: "Chicle!"
Chicle says: "Oh, whoops, was that bad?"
The ghosts begin to entrap Hunson. Marceline flings her bass at them, but it phases through.
Ghost says: "Vampires can't hurt ghosts, stupid."
Marceline says: "Shoot."
Finn says: "Finn's turn!"
Ghost says: "Wha?!"
Ghost says: "!"
Marceline says: "Good night, Hamburger Hills!"
Marceline says: "There will be no encore."
Princess Bubblegum says: "My gracious."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm so sorry you had to deal with Cousin Chicle's schemes."
Princess Bubblegum says: "My family's out of control."
Hunson says: "It's fine."
Hunson says: "My cool daughter took care of it."
Hunson says: "And guess what I got from a vendor."
Hunson says: "It looks too big to me."
Hunson says: "But they said that's the style now with punk rockers."
Marceline says: "Thanks for standing up for me tonight."
Hunson says: "I'm bad, but I'm no so bad, right?"
Hunson says: "So when are you gonna have some kids?"
Marceline says: "Dad!"
