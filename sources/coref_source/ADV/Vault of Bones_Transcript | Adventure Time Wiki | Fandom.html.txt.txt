The episode starts off with Jake putting water in a teapot to make tea while Finn and Flame Princess are playing cards. Flame Princess sighs.
Finn says: "What's up?"
Flame Princess says: "Nothing, I don't know."
Flame Princess continues to look at her cards and Finn comes up and stares at Flame Princess in her face, and both of them start laughing.
Jake says: "If anybody wants tea, it will be ready in a few minutes."
Jake heats up the tea on the stove, Jake waits for the tea to be ready when suddenly the tea lights up in flames and Flame King swooshes over to Flame Princess.
Flame King says: "Evil..."
Flame King says: "evil..."
Flame King says: "evil..."
Flame King says: "evil..."
Flame King says: "evil!"
Flame Princess looks at Flame King.
Jake says: "Whoa, Flame King!"
Flame Princess says: "Father!"
Flame Princess gets embarrassed.
Flame King says: "Oh, well, uh..."
Flame King says: "Sorry, I..."
Flame King says: "thought my daughter was alone..."
Flame King says: "Well, I'll just be going now."
Flame King says: "Nice teapot."
Flame King vanishes and the teapot is left charred and black.
Jake says: "Ooh!"
Finn says: "What was that?"
Jake says: "He was saying "evil, evil, evil" over and over again."
Finn says: "Yeah, I heard."
Jake says: "Well, I wasn't sure if you heard him 'cause he was whispering."
Finn says: "Yeah, I heard."
Flame Princess says: "Ugh, he's so annoying."
Jake says: "Well, I was just trying to help."
Flame Princess says: "Oh, not you, Jake, my dad."
Flame Princess says: "I always catch him whispering stuff in my ear while I'm not paying attention."
Flame Princess says: "He keeps saying I'm evil."
Finn stands up on the table.
Finn says: "Whoa, you best not be believing that whack bunk."
Finn says: "I bet he's trying to make your life bad, so you'll think you're evil."
Finn says: "But you're really not!"
Flame Princess says: "How can I know for sure?"
Finn says: "Dungeons."
Flame Princess says: "What?"
Finn says: "Let's have a good time in a dungeon or something, that always clears my head that reminds me what's what."
Flame Princess says: "And that will make me good?"
Finn says: "No, that will show you not to worry so much, because you're already good in here."
Finn puts a finger to his chest, looking for his heart.
Flame Princess says: "Ok, yeah, let's do it."
Finn says: "Dungeons!"
Finn puts up his fist.
Flame Princess says: "Dungeons!"
Flame Princess puts her fist up also and they start laughing again.
Jake says: "Chamomile tea!"
Finn and Flame Princess look at Jake and laughing again and running away to find the dungeon and Jake sits down and takes a sip of the tea and moves back of the sofa. Meanwhile, Finn is finding secret door switches in the jungle in order to lead Flame Princess to a dungeon, Finn looks under a rock then, pulls on the vines of the leaves.
Flame Princess says: "Is this how you look for a dungeon?"
Finn says: "Yeah..."
Finn says: "a lot of times the entrances are hidden, so you gotta look under rocks and stuff for a secret switch."
Finn feels the wood of a trunk and knocks on it.
Finn says: "Sometimes it takes a while..."
Finn says: "Hmm."
Flame Princess says: "I'll just use my heat sense."
Flame Princess, then spins around the forest to get a signal on a secret switch to a dungeon.
Flame Princess says: "That tree over there is not made of wood."
Finn says: "Really?"
The two run over there to the tree.
Finn says: "Yes!"
Finn climbs on the tree and pulls the switch on the branch and a skull shaped hole opens up from a giant rock. The two of them go down to the dungeon. There are skeletons and skulls lying everywhere. Finn finds a gauntlet on the ground.
Finn says: "Ooh..."
Finn says: "gauntlet."
Flame Princess says: "Thanks for taking me out Finn."
Finn says: "No prob, Bob, light this for me, will ya?"
Flame Princess says: "Oh, sure."
Flame Princess says: "Um..."
Flame Princess says: "do we need a torch?"
Flame Princess says: "I'm sort of made of fire."
Finn says: "Oh..."
Finn says: "well, I guess torches are just cool for dungeons, you know?"
Flame Princess says: "Oh, okay."
Finn says: "Yeah..."
Finn says: "I like to hang on to it."
Flame Princess says: "Boy, this place is creepy!"
Finn says: "Really?"
Finn says: "I feel like it's trying too hard."
Finn says: "Gold piece!"
Flame Princess says: "Oh, you mean, like, with all the skulls?"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
They come across a skeleton fishing with his right arm. The skeleton turns at the sound of their voices and drops his arm into the black water.
Flame Princess says: "What?"
Boney says: "Hey!"
Boney says: "What are you doing here?"
Flame Princess says: "Burning you alive!"
Finn says: "Haha no, no, wait a sec."
Finn says: "Sorry, one second."
Boney says: "Sure."
Finn says: "He might have an important loot on him, so we don't wanna just burn him up; plus it's a little cruel even for an evil guy, check this out."
Finn says: "RRRAAA, you're gonna surrender!"
Boney and Finn yell at each other for a while.
Boney says: "Okay, okay, I surrender!!!"
Finn says: "I shall grant thee clemency!"
Finn says: "If you do the splits!"
Finn says: "Do the splits!"
Boney says: "I-I can't-I can't do the splits."
Finn says: "Do the splits, thou milk-livered maggot pie!"
Boney says: "Okay, okay..."
Boney says: "Ow, ow, ow!"
Finn says: "See, a lot of times you can overpower these guys with confidence."
Flame Princess says: "Neat!"
Finn says: "Got any loot on ya?"
Boney says: "Just this map."
Boney says: "It'll-it'll help you."
Finn says: "Ha!"
Finn says: "See?"
Finn says: "This would've been burned!"
Flame Princess says: "Yeah, no, that makes sense."
Finn says: "What else you got?!"
Finn says: "!"
Boney says: "Yeah!"
Boney says: "Uh, uh, there's a treasure chest in the corner, please stop yelling."
Finn says: "Hah, hah!"
Finn says: "I knew it."
Finn says: "Oh, cram it to the butternuts, it's locked!"
Boney says: "Aahh!"
Boney says: "I don't know were the keys is, please don't yell!"
Finn says: "Hahaha, alright."
Finn says: "We can come back to that later."
Finn says: "Hey, are you having fun?"
Flame Princess says: "Mhm."
Boney says: "I- I'll just stay here."
Finn and FP are walking.
Flame Princess says: "Race you to the next monster!"
Finn says: "WHOA, whoa!"
Flame Princess says: "What?"
Finn says: "That's not how you do things in a dungeon."
Finn says: "You gotta sneak."
Flame Princess says: "Sneak?"
Finn says: "Like this."
Finn says: "Ok, this guy's too big to intimidate, but I have a plan."
Finn says: "First, you shoot some fire at that rope, the chandelier falls, we distract the monster and we run in."
Finn says: "Element surprise."
Flame Princess says: "Wow."
Finn says: "You ready?"
Flame Princess says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Before we go in, how good are you at quietly throwing a tiny bit of fire?"
Flame Princess says: "Uhh..."
Flame Princess says: "what?"
Finn says: "Like on a scale of 1 to 100, how good are you at quietly throwing a tiny bit of fire at a rope 50 feet away?"
Flame Princess says: "Uhh..."
Finn says: "Scale of 1 to 100."
Flame Princess says: "42."
Finn says: "42?!"
Finn says: "!"
Flame Princess says: "Well, I don't know!"
Flame Princess says: "I've never rated myself before."
Finn says: "Well, that's cool, that's cool."
Finn says: "Just try to hit that rope."
Flame Princess shoots a small amount of fire accurately at the rope. It catches on fire and it breaks, therefore the chandelier falls, too. Finn and Flame Princess come in running and Finn swings at the guard with his sword, but goes right through it. He waves his arm through it and realizes it's a hologram.
Flame Princess says: "Are you okay?"
Finn says: "Yeah, I'm good."
Finn says: "it's a hologram."
Flame Princess says: "Oh."
Flame Princess says: "Neat."
Flame Princess says: "So, uhh, should we keep going?"
Finn says: "Yeah, although it does raise the question."
Finn says: "Why would someone go through the trouble of setting up a hologram?"
Finn says: "Unless..."
Finn says: "they've hidden something in this room?"
Flame Princess goes off to the side, sits down and sighs. She finds a pebble, throws it in the air, and shoots it with a bit of fire.
Finn says: "Hey, wake up."
Flame Princess says: "I was meditating."
Finn says: "Look what I found."
Flame Princess says: "A key!"
Finn raises his eyebrows multiple times.
Flame Princess says: "We have to go back?"
Finn says: "We don't have to, we get to!"
Finn says: "Come on."
Boney is looking for his missing arm in the water. He hears Finn singing Dungeon Crawl and hurries back to his position and does the splits.
Finn says: "See?"
Finn says: "That didn't take long at all."
Finn says: "Now we get treasure."
Flame Princess says: "Okay."
Flame Princess says: "Jeez."
Flame Princess says: "This is kinda boring."
Flame Princess says: "At least he's walking fast."
Finn looks back at FP and gestures for her to follow. He points at the floor.
Finn says: "See?"
Finn says: "That's where I found the key."
He starts crawling and finds a hole in the wall. Finn and Flame Princess look inside and sees a bigger cage with a keyhole. Finn gives her the key and she crawls through the hole. She walks over to the cage and Finn gives her a thumbs up. As soon as FP fits the key through the keyhole, it opens and a skeleton comes out, which startles FP.
Finn says: "Snapdragons!!"
Snapdragon says: "Take my place, take my place!"
Flame Princess says: "Scatter fire!"
Finn says: "No, no, we shake them down first, remember?"
Flame Princess says: "He..."
Flame Princess says: "wanted me to take his place."
Finn says: "Whoohoo!"
Flame Princess says: "Finn, I'm not having any fun."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Why?"
Flame Princess says: "Well, you keep wanting me to do things your way."
Flame Princess says: "But I don't like doing things your way."
Flame Princess says: "Is that because I am evil?"
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "No, wait, that's..."
Finn says: "no!"
Finn says: "Uhh, hey, you know what?"
Finn says: "Let's do things your way."
Flame Princess says: "Really?"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "I've been acting an uncouth lout, m'lady."
Finn says: "Okay, so there's a door over there."
Finn says: "What do you wanna do?"
Flame Princess says: "I..."
Flame Princess says: "burn it down."
Finn says: "Okay, that worked."
Finn says: "Now what do you do..."
Flame Princess says: "RRAAAAAGGGHHH!!"
Finn says: "Uhh..."
Finn says: "Good- good job, FP."
Flame Princess says: "Thanks, FTH!"
Flame Princess says: "Haa!"
Flame Princess says: "Huh?"
Flame Princess says: "Ugh."
Finn says: "Oh, Sham man."
Finn says: "It's the legion of Goo Skulls!"
Finn says: "Uh, how do you defend?"
Flame Princess says: "Uhh..."
Flame Princess says: "snake fire!!"
Finn says: "Fire burn goo."
Flame Princess says: "Yes!"
Flame Princess says: "Feel my flames, puny worms!"
Flame Princess says: "The power of destruction!"
Finn says: "Woh."
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Flame Princess!!"
Flame Princess says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Ahh!!!"
Flame Princess Angry.
She ascends from a hole and see Finn and the Giant Goo Skull.
Flame Princess says: "Release him or feel the wrath of the Princess of Flames!"
Giant Goo Skull blows raspberry.
Flame Princess says: "Very well."
Flame Princess charges at the Giant Goo Skull.
Finn screaming under the goo, terrified.
Finn says: "Hot Daniel!"
Finn says: "Flame Princess."
Finn says: "I thought you were going to burn me alive."
Flame Princess says: "No way!"
Flame Princess says: "I'd never do that to my boyfriend."
Later at the hill during sunset.
Flame Princess says: "Ha, thanks Finn."
Flame Princess says: "That was a really awesome experience."
Finn says: "Dungeons totes clear your head, right?"
Flame Princess says: "I forget how good it feels to destroy stuff."
Finn says: "Uhhhh..."
Finn says: ".."
Flame Princess says: "I mean, like evil stuff."
Finn says: "Oh yeah, cool."
Flame Princess says: "We should go again sometimes."
Flame Princess says: "Do you know any other dungeons?"
Finn says: "Maybe next time we should just go to like..."
Finn says: "a farmer's market."
Flame Princess says: "And burn it."
Finn says: "Hmm, try this key."
Flame Princess succeeds in unlocking the chest and shocked.
Finn says: "What is it?"
A mysterious butt-shaped creature wakes up and winks at Flame Princess.
