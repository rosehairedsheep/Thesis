Finn says: "Swords!"
Jake says: "Swords!"
Finn says: "Yeah, swords!"
Jake says: "Yeah, swords!"
Finn says: "Whoo!"
Jake says: "Whoo!"
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, men and their swords..."
Tree Trunks says: "You boys, stop horsing around with my apples!"
Both Finn says: "Aw,Tree Trunks!"
Jake says: "Aw,Tree Trunks!"
Tree Trunks says: "Now, come on over!"
Tree Trunks says: "I baked y'all an apple pie."
Finn says: "Yeah, apple pie!"
Jake says: "Whooo-hoo-hoo!"
Finn says: "I'm gonna eat it all before you even GET there!"
Jake says: "Noooooo!"
Tree Trunks sets the pie down on a table.
Finn says: "Apple pie!"
Jake says: "Don't let him eat it all!"
Tree Trunks says: "Now, you boys sit down and behave yourselves."
Tree Trunks says: "Oh!"
A fly lands on her apple pie and flies away.
Tree Trunks says: "Shoo, fly!"
Tree Trunks says: "Get off my apple pie!"
Tree Trunks says: "Huh!"
Tree Trunks says: "Bye-bye."
Finn says: "Why are you throwing the pie away?"
A bunch of flies fly in and fly around the pie; Finn and Jake groan in disgust.
Tree Trunks says: "Flies wanted it, they can have it."
Tree Trunks says: "Anyways, don't y'all worry 'cause the new pie is coming in the wag of a lamb's tail."
Finn says: "New pie?"
Jake says: "New pie?"
Finn says: "Woohoo!"
Finn says: "Pie, yeah!"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Tree Trunks says: "Here you are."
Finn says: "Wow."
Tree Trunks says: "Come on, go ahead."
Finn and Jake eat Tree Trunk's delicious apple pie.
Tree Trunks says: "What you think?"
Jake says: "Best apple pie ever!"
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, Jake, thank you, but that ain't the best apple pie."
Finn says: "What are you talking about, Tree Trunks?"
Finn says: "What can be better than your apple pie?"
Jake says: "You ate all the pie..."
Tree Trunks says: "Finn, what would you do if you could do anything?"
Finn says: "Anything?"
Finn says: "Well, I'd catch a shooting star, travel to outer space and fight space monsters!"
Jake says: "I'd carve my face on the moon so the moon would look like my face!"
Finn says: "What would you do, Tree Trunks?"
Tree Trunks says: "I would go pick an apple."
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Lame."
Jake slaps Finn.
Finn says: "I'm sorry."
Finn says: "I mean, it's just you pick apples every day."
Tree Trunks says: "This apple ain't like the apples that I pick."
Tree Trunks says: "They say it's the apple of apples; rarest kind of all."
Tree Trunks says: "Legends call it the Crystal Gem Apple."
Jake spits tea at Finn.
Jake says: "That sounds awesome!"
Finn says: "Where is it?"
Tree Trunks says: "I've heard that it grows at the deepest end of the Evil Dark Forest."
Finn says: "Whoo!"
Finn says: "Tree Trunks you gotta go pick that apple!"
Jake says: "YEAH!"
Tree Trunks says: "What?"
Tree Trunks says: "Me?"
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, no I'm just a cute little elephant."
Tree Trunks says: "I'm not cut out for adventuring."
Finn says: "Tree Trunks!"
Finn says: "This is your dream!"
Finn says: "Think about eating that apple with your own mouth."
Jake says: "Or your trunk."
Finn says: "Imagine the flavor."
Jake says: "And your satisfied face."
Tree Trunks says: "Really?"
Tree Trunks says: "You think I can handle the Scary Dark Forest?"
Finn says: "Yeah, and we'll help you."
Jake says: "We love you, Tree Trunks."
Tree Trunks says: "Okay."
Tree Trunks says: "I'll do it."
Tree Trunks says: "Call me..."
Tree Trunks says: "Adventurer Tree Trunks."
Adventure Time Screen comes with Tree Trunks as the sword.
Finn says: "Yeah, Tree Trunks!"
Jake says: "Yeah, Tree Trunks!"
Tree Trunks says: "I love being so high up from the ground!"
Jake says: "Psst, I can take you even higher on my shoulders."
Finn says: "No, Jake."
Finn says: "She has a weak heart."
Jake says: "Oh, yeah."
They step into flesh.
Finn says: "Ewww, why is this ground all squishy?"
Jake says: "Whatever it is, I'm liking it."
Jake says: "Oh, yeah!"
Tree Trunks says: "I wanna try!"
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "I'm cool with you letting you do whatever you want."
Tree Trunks says: "Heeheehee!"
Tree Trunks says: "It's like some cookie dough!"
An eye comes up and stares at Tree Trunks.
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, hello there."
Finn says: "Uhh, Tree Trunks, stay away from that."
The Wall of Flesh attacks Finn and Jake.
Finn says: "Ugh, you're gonna get it, wall of flesh."
Finn and Jake attack the monster.
Tree Trunks says: "An eye and a mouth."
Tree Trunks says: "Well, I think I got the perfect thing for him or her..."
Tree Trunks says: "stickers!"
Finn says: "Careful, Tree Trunks, this thing is evil."
Tree Trunks says: "Here's a rainbow sticker, and here's a scratch-and-sniff sticker."
Tree Trunks says: "Smells just like a pickle."
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, and this one is a holographic unicorn, but it doesn't have a horn."
The monster grabs Tree Trunks.
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, now, whatcha doing?"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Tree Trunks!"
Finn cuts off the wall's arm before it could eat Tree Trunks.
The wall returns to hide in the tree.
Jake says: "Whoo!"
Finn says: "You better stay in that tree, baby."
Finn says: "Um, Tree Trunks were you putting stickers on that evil monster?"
Tree Trunks says: "Yes, I thought it needed some tender love and affection."
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, what a pretty butterfly!"
Tree Trunks follows the butterfly.
Finn says: "Tree Trunks?"
Finn says: "Ugh."
Finn says: "Jake, I just realized that Tree Trunks is old and bonkers."
Finn says: "We can't take her through this Evil Dark Forest."
Jake says: "Nah, she'll be fine."
Finn says: "But the monsters?"
Jake says: "It's fine."
Jake says: "It's fine!"
Finn says: "Are you sure?"
Finn says: "'Cause she has zero adventurer training."
Jake says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine, she'll be fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine."
Finn says: "Maybe it is fine."
Finn says: "Tree Trunks?"
Jake says: "Where'd she go?"
Finn says: "Tree Trunks!"
Finn says: "We gotta find her, Jake!"
Finn says: "Tree Trunks!"
Jake says: "Where are you, Tree Trunks?"

Tree Trunks says: "I think I know a way to help him out."
Jake says: "Uhh, you should stay here, Tree Trunks."
Tree Trunks says: "But I thought Finn told me that I was a top notch adventurer."
Tree Trunks says: "And my adventurer instincts tell me to seduce that tentacle critter with my womanly charms and elephant prowess."
Jake says: "Uhh, no way."
Off-screen Tree Trunks kissed Jake on his face many times.
