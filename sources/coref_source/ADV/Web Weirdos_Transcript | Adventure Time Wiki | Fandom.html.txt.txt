The scene shows a few odd trees next to a mountain in an open shot, there are some clouds visible in the background. Finn and Jake round the mountain's corner into the shot and look at one another knowingly. Jake jumps to one tree and across to the base of the mountain, doing creative jumps and swirls with his powers all the way.
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Yo, Finn, look what I found!"
Jake says: "A vertical trampoline!"
Jake says: "It's sticky!"
Finn says: "Dude, it's a spider web."
Jake says: "Ohh."
Jake says: "Well, cut me out, yo!"
Finn says: "No way, I'll stunt you out!"
Finn says: "Whoah!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "I was thinking something else would happen."
Jake says: "You got anything sharp?"
Finn says: "The only sharp thing I had was my fingernails, but you made me cut them."
Jake says: "They were too long, Finn."
Scene cuts to a flashback of Finn petting Jake on a couch at the Tree Fort, a ripping noise is made.
Jake says: "Augh!"
Jake says: "You broke the skin, dude!"
Finn says: "I guess my fingernails are really loaaeaeuAAAAHH--!"
Scene cuts back to the web.
Finn says: "Oh, yeah."
Finn says: "Sorry."
Jake says: "It's cool, man."
Finn says: "Can you..."
Finn says: "stretch us out of here?"
Jake tries to use his powers, but wears himself out quickly.
Jake says: "I'm gonna take a nap while you grow out your fingernails."
Jake says: "We'll make our escape when I wake up."
Bug says: "You'll never escape!"
Bug says: "We'll all die in the web."
Fly says: "That's the circle of life."
Finn says: "That's not a circle."
Finn says: "That's, like, a straight line."
Bug says: "We don't make the rules, man."
Finn says: "Well, don't just give up."
Bug says: "The spiders are back!"
Fly in unison says: "The spiders are back!"
Fly says: "Try to stay calm."
Fly says: "Greet your fate with dignity."
Both bugs start screaming and flailing around helplessly.
Finn says: "We gotta go, Jake!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Scene shows two huge spiders crawling down into the valley, moving towards the web with Finn and Jake.
Barb says: "So what?"
Barb says: "You're not talking to me now?"
Ed says: "No, I'm just tired of setting traps all day, solo-style."
Barb says: "Why are you mad?"
Ed says: "I just said I was tired."
Barb says: "But you're acting like you're mad."
Ed says: "I'm not mad."
Ed says: "Oh, look, food..."
Ed says: "that I caught..."
Ed says: "in my web..."
Ed says: "for us."
Barb says: "I spin webs, too, Ed."
Ed says: "Yeah, I know."
Barb says: "I try just as hard as you."
Ed says: "Well, go ahead then."
Ed says: "Wrap them up for laters."
Ed says: "What's wrong, Barb?"
Finn says: "What's going on there, Jake?"
Barb says: "I can't!"
Barb says: "You think I'm gross when I spin my web!"
Ed says: "What?"
Barb says: "I can see it on your face!"
Barb says: "Tell me that you don't!"
Ed says: "Uhh..."
Ed says: "I uh..."
Ed says: "You tell me, you don't find me gross!"
Barb says: "Oh, get stuffed, Ed!"
Ed gasps.
Finn says: "You guys are sad."
Finn says: "Ugh!"
Finn says: "What is that sound?"
Finn says: "Sick, dude!"
Finn says: "She makes that sound, too?"
Ed says: "Yeah, I guess, but she never does it in front of me."
Ed says: "Anyway, it's not gross when guys do it."
Finn says: "Dude, that's not cool."
Finn says: "You need to think about what you say and how that affects your lady."
Ed says: "How about how she affects me?"
Ed says: "I love her, man."
Jake says: "Oh, snap, how long was I out?"
Ed says: "Can someone tell me why we fight, why she treats me like all I do is make her feel bad?"
Ed says: "Tell me, Glob, why don't you ever answer me!"
Ed says: "?"
Bug says: "It's hard to step outside of yourself when you're enmeshed with another being."
Bug says: "."
Bug says: "Oh, Grod!"
Bug says: "It's over!"
Bug says: "It's over!!"
Finn says: "Wait!"
Ed says: "What?"
Finn says: "Umm..."
Finn says: "Right now, we gotta real-talk about your girlfriend."
Ed says: "I don't real-talk with my food."
Finn says: "Uhh..."
Finn says: "We real-talk now, or you're going to be as single as your stinky web squirter!"
Ed says: "Yeah, right."
Ed says: "You just wanna get out of my web."
Ed says: "All you ever want to do is escape!"
Ed says: "You're always, like, in cahoots, makin' plans not to be food."
Finn says: "I'm not in cahoots!"
Ed says: "So okay, eat your friend here."
Finn says: "Okay."
Bug says: "No, man!"
Bug says: "What?!"
Bug says: "!"
Bug says: "Where's your heart?!"
Bug says: "!"
Bug says: "Look inside yourself!"
Bug says: "This isn't you!"
Finn says: "I'm gonna fake eat you, man."
Bug says: "Oh."
Bug says: "Word."
Bug says: "Noooo!"
Bug says: "Oh, my guts!"
Bug says: "My guts everywhere!"
Bug says: "Agh, how could you!"
Finn says: "Okay, first off, then, how you're going about this isn't working."
Finn says: "Am I right?"
Ed says: "Ugh, yeah."
Ed says: "It's not working."
Ed says: "My way sucks."
Finn says: "Cool, now we've gotta do damage control."
Finn says: "Healing the negs energy at the source."
Ed says: "Yes, heal the neg-jerseys in me."
Finn says: "Alright, uhh..."
Jake whispers mostly nondescript words to Finn.
Finn says: "Go find Barb a present."
Finn says: "That'll fix the first neg."
Finn says: "Can you do that?"
Ed says: "Yeah, I can find her a present."
Ed says: "If you think that'll help."
Ed says: "I don't think it will, but what do I know, I'm just a big ol' dummy who does everything wrong..."
Bug says: "Whee!"
Finn says: "You're free!"
Finn says: "Aw, man."
Jake says: "It's okay, Finn."
Jake says: "You bought us some time."
Finn says: "Yeah, think fast, what can we use?"
The camera pans back and forth of their view in a small valley.
Jake says: "There's nothing!"
Jake says: "Just a bunch of nature."
Finn says: "I have a dumb idea."
Scene cuts to Ed searching the woods.
Ed says: "It's magic or something!"
Ed says: "We can hang this up over our mantle and snuggle by the fire, huh, like we--like we used to!"
Ed says: "I'm gonna fix us, Barb!"
Ed says: "Fix us!"
Scene cuts back to Ed's web.
Jake says: "Alright, one..."
Jake says: "two..."
Jake says: "three!"
Finn spits into the air and narrowly misses a passing bird.
Bird 1 says: "Yo what?"
Finn says: "Shoot!"
Jake says: "Here comes another one."
Jake says: "One two three!"
Bird 2 says: "My eyes!"
Bird 2 says: "Agh!!"
Finn says: "Ha ha, yes!"
Finn says: "Finally!"
Jake says: "Good job!"
Jake says: "Last chance for life."
Jake says: "Break out!"
Finn says: "Yeah, you mommy!"
Barb says: "Hey, what's going on here!"
Finn says: "Nothing."
Finn says: "Oh, crab apples!"
Barb says: "Where's Ed?"
Finn says: "Oh, uh, he's getting you an "I'm sorry" gift."
Jake says: "He feels crazy about making you cry."
Barb says: "He does?"
Barb says: "Really?"
Ed says: "Barb!"
Ed says: "Barb!"
Barb says: "Ed?"
Ed says: "Barb, look!"
Ed says: "Damage control!"
Ed says: "Check it out!"
Ed says: "I wrapped it up and everything!"
Barb says: "Oh, Ed, I can't believe it!"
Ed says: "Yeah!"
Ed says: "Come on, open it!"
Barb says: "I really just, it's just so unlike you to--  What's this?"
Ed says: "It's a sword!"
Ed says: "I found it in the woods!"
Barb says: "In the woods?"
Ed says: "Yeah, it's magical, though."
Ed says: "Check out the blade!"
Barb says: "You got this for you, Ed."
Ed says: "No, I got it for us!"
Ed says: "For snuggles by the fire!"
Barb says: "We are never gonna snuggles until you learn to appreciate me!"
Ed says: "Oh, really?"
Ed says: "Well, I guess we're never gonna eat again either 'cause I catch the food, and your butt is dysfunctional!"
Ed says: "Eeh-ya!"
Bug says: "Just break up, you guys!"
Fly says: "Do it for you!"
Ed says: "Now what are you gonna eat?"
Ed says: "Huh, Barb?"
Barb says: "I'm gonna eat you!"
Finn says: "Yo, that's wrong!"
Barb says: "Who cares!"
The two spiders start fighting and rolling around; Finn picks up Jake and starts running away.
Jake says: "We're free!"
Ed is screaming as Barb beats him up in the background, Finn stops running.
Jake says: "Oh, no."
Jake says: "You got that look on your face."
Jake says: "You going back to help that fool?"
Finn says: "His wife's gonna eat him!"
Jake says: "Spider marriage is complicated."
Jake says: "Sometimes, you just gotta mind your own biz."
Ed says: "Oh, help, somebody help me!"
Jake says: "Ugh..."
Jake says: "Go with Glob."
Finn runs offscreen; scene shifts to Ed being beaten up by Barb.
Ed says: "Mercy!"
Barb punches him a few times and hisses, then crawls over to his body and prepares to bite his head as he doesn't fight back. She is then hit by a tree and the scene shows it was Finn swinging it like a bat.
Barb says: "You little twerp!"
Barb says: "Are you stupid or something?"
Finn says: "Yeah, I'm stupid."
Finn says: "But I know something real."
Finn says: "You shouldn't eat your husband!"
Barb grabs him and pins him to the wall. As Finn tries to fight back she pins each of his limbs until he has nothing to attack with and she starts to move her mouth towards his face. She then starts convulsing and screaming in apparent pain.
Jake says: "Yo, smoothin' things out?"
Finn says: "Not exactly..."
Ed says: "Okay..."
The white sac bursts and thousands of tiny spiders start flowing from it like a black fountain.
Finn says: "What is happening!"
Finn says: "?"
Jake says: "Something we're not supposed to see."
Barb says: "Oh, Ed."
Barb says: "We're parents!"
Finn says: "Aw, sick!"
Ed says: "I think there's hope for us, Barb."
Barb says: "We can make a new start, as a family."
Jake says: "Nice."
Finn says: "Think they're gonna make it?"
Jake says: "Love like theirs will always find a way."
Jake says: "It'll crawl all up over you and drain your body fluids, poisoning you slowly until you pass out."
Jake says: "Circle of life, Finn..."
Jake says: "circle of life."
The scene closes with the egg sac still releasing thousands of tiny spiders and Finn screaming while the still wrapped-up Jake accepts his fate in the pile of baby spiders.
