The episode starts with Finn and Jake waking up in a pile of bananas.
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Heh heh."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Where are we?"
Jake says: "I dunno."
Finn says: "What did we do last night?"
Jake says: "Mayhaps we drank juice of the Elder Toad."
Finn says: "Eh, I doubt it."
Finn says: "Yo, do you see this?"
Finn says: "We're in a cage!"
Finn says: "Do you think we, like, did something wrong?"
Jake says: "Yeah, right."
Jake says: "When did we ever did wrong actions?"
Jake says: "Get real."
Finn says: "Who ya calling?"
Jake says: "I'm callin' BMO, see if he knows what happened."
Jake says: "Junk..."
Jake says: "My new camera phone..."
Jake says: "Wait, c'mere!"
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "I guess I vid-taped a buttload of stuff on here."
Finn says: "Play it for the clues within."
Jake says: "Okay, play."
Static on phone.
Finn says: "Did you take it yet?"
Jake says: "Recording."
Finn says: "Okay, get a shot of the portal."
Jake moves the phone to reveal a blue swirling vortex that is apparently a Nightosphere portal.
Finn says: "Gonna go through this biz!"
Jake says: "Alright, let's do—"
Finn says: "Oh, no!"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Battery crunked out."
Finn says: "Dude, do you remember any of that mess?"
Jake says: "No, but I guess we're here on purpose?"
Finn says: "So we opened a portal to somewhere, but where?"
Nightosphere Jailer says: "The Nightosphere."
Finn says: "AHHHhhhh..."
Jake says: "AHHHhhhh..."
Nightosphere Jailer says: "You're in the Nightosphere."
Finn says: "Are you sure?"
Nightosphere Jailer says: "Uh, yes."
Nightosphere Jailer says: "You got thrown in jail."
Nightosphere Jailer says: "Look."
Jake says: "Look!"
Scene cuts to a shot of a statue of Marceline's father.
Finn says: "Marceline's dad!"
Finn says: "We really are in the Nightosphere!"
Nightosphere Jailer says: "Up an' at em, people."
Nightosphere Jailer says: "Eveyone out of your cages."
Nightosphere Jailer says: "My shift is over, and no one's shown up, so..."
Finn says: "Whoa, wait."
Finn says: "You're letting us go?"
Nightosphere Jailer says: "I mean..."
Nightosphere Jailer says: "yeah, but not really."
Nightosphere Jailer says: "You're in the nightosphere, so..."
Finn says: "So what?"
Jake says: "Is there an outlet somewhere for this?"
Finn says: "Hey, c'mon!"
Finn says: "Just tell us how we can get back to our world."
Nightosphere Jailer says: "You can't leave the Nightosphere."
Nightosphere Jailer says: "Not unless he let's you."
Finn says: "Marceline's dad."
Jake says: "Marceline's dad."
Nightosphere Jailer says: "Yeah, that's Hunson Abadeer."
Nightosphere Jailer says: "He runs this place."
[Scene cuts to a plaque under the statue that says says: "OUR GREAT LEADER IS WITH US FOR ALL ETERNITY" and a large caterpillar-like demon runs between the statues legs."
"HUNSON ABADEER says: "OUR GREAT LEADER IS WITH US FOR ALL ETERNITY" and a large caterpillar-like demon runs between the statues legs."
Jake says: "Hunson Abadeer?"
Jake says: "Alright."
Finn says: "Well, dude, how do we talk to him?"
Nightosphere Jailer says: "You can't just talk to the boss."
Nightosphere Jailer says: "You gotta make an appointment."
Finn says: "Yeah, but we don't even know why we're here!"
Jake says: "And what's up with this?"
Nightosphere Jailer says: "Ugh."
Nightosphere Jailer says: "Oh!"
Nightosphere Jailer says: "Oh, oh, sick!"
Nightosphere Jailer says: "You touched that stuff?!"
Nightosphere Jailer says: "!"
Jake looks at the banana questioningly.
Nightosphere Jailer says: "Later, fools."
Demons cheer.
Jake says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "Is there an outlet anywhere?"
Jake says: "You guys..."
Finn says: "Maybe this is where they put all the dummy demons."
Finn says: "Let's go out that hole, man."
Jake says: "Okay, get on."
Finn climbs on his back, and Jake stretches up through the hole. They climb out and see various scenes of chaos.
Finn says: "Mm-hm, mm-hm."
Finn says: "Pretty neat."
A reddish cloud flies overhead and obliterates a mountain with a green ray.
Finn says: "Whoa, look!"
Cloud shoots more rays.
Scene cuts to a demon kid playing with tiny demons.
Demon dad says: "Charlie, don't socialize with the smaller demons!"
Demon dad says: "They're dirty and stupid!"
Ray strikes the dad, turning him into a bunch of little demons.
Charlie says: "Daddy!"
Cloud shoots a mountain, turning it into a sculpture of Hunson Abadeer's head.
Finn says: "What is that?"
Jake says: "I think it's like sentient blood mist."
Finn says: "Cool."
Jake says: "C'mon, let's see if anyone knows where Hunson Abadeer is."
Finn says: "Alright, well, how about that dude?"
Jake says: "Okay."
Finn says: "Yo, bros!"
Finn says: "How do we talk to Hunson Abadeer?"
Half Monster Demon says: "The teller can help you."
Half Monster Demon says: "Get in my flipping belly, and I will transport you."
Half Monster Demon says: "My insides are habitable."
Half Monster Demon says: "You will not be digested."
Finn and Jake climb in, and the demon flies them over to a river full of little demons.
Finn says: "Bye, mister!"
Boat Demon says: "Okay, bozos, make room, make room, make room!"
Small Demon says: "Ouch!"
Small Demon says: "Come on!"
Boat Demon says: "Scooch over, fatty."
Small Demon says: "I can't, dude."
Small Demon says: "This outbox is packed tighter than my tummy tunnel when I can't make brown on the camping trips because of my anxieties and I have IBS also."
Small Demon says: "Ow!"
Finn says: "Hey, guy, are you the teller?"
Boat Demon says: "No, no, no, this is the line to meet the teller."
Finn says: "No, man, are you for real?"
Finn says: "How long's the wait?!"
Finn says: "!"
Boat Demon says: "I dunno."
Boat Demon says: "I just like to row around on top of their heads."
Finn says: "Bunk that!"
Jake says: "Hey, do you know about this?"
Boat Demon says: "I..."
Boat Demon says: "ew, no."
Boat Demon says: "Sick."
Finn says: "Why do we need to see the teller anyway?"
Finn says: "We just wanna see Hunson Abadeer and find out what happened to us!"
Boat Demon says: "The teller will get you in touch with Hunson Abadeer."
Boat Demon says: "We got systems down here."
Boat Demon says: "You gotta swim the proper channels, ya know?"
Small Demon says: "Youse ain't special!"
Small Demon says: "Youse gotta wait just like the rest of youse..."
Small Demon says: "Us."
Finn says: "Where's the line start?"
Boat Demon says: "Oh..."
Boat Demon says: "I dunno."
Boat Demon says: "The thing sorta governs itself."
Finn and Jake climb into the river and squeeze in between the demons.
Finn says: "Tight!"
Jake says: "Tight!"
Boat Demon rows over their heads.
Finn says: "Ow!"
Jake says: "Ow!"
Finn moans.
Jake says: "That guy stinks."
Finn says: "Excuse me!"
Finn says: "Excuse me!"
Finn says: "Big man?"
Finn says: "Over here!"
Big Demon says: "Huh?"
Big Demon says: "What, me?"
Finn says: "Uh, yeah, how long have you been in line for?"
Big Demon says: "How..."
Big Demon says: "long?"
Finn says: "Oh, butt traps."
Finn says: "Jake, stretch us to the front."
All demons says: "NO CUTTING!!!"
Big Demon says: "I will kill you with all my hopes and regrets!"
Finn says: "All right, dudes, chill!"
Finn says: "We'll wait!"
Finn says: "I can't feel my legs."
Finn and Jake are both quietly crying.
Finn says: "SAY SOMETHING!!"
Finn says: "Say something to me!!!"
Jake says: "I..."
Jake says: "can't."
Jake says: "I got nothing to say anymore."
Finn says: "Just make up words then!"
Jake says: "Bloobity bloo bloo blah blee blee blah."
Jake says: "Shree shrah..."
Jake says: "Hey, check it out."
Jake says: "We're at the front of the line."
Finn says: "Woohoo!"
Jake says: "Woohoo!"
Finn says: "Yo, yo!"
Finn says: "We wanna talk to Abadeer!"
Teller says: "Wha..."
Teller says: "Huh?"
Teller says: "When your thingy comes up, Hunson Abadeer will see you through the door."
Finn says: "42 million?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "What's the number on the door?"
The door reads 41,999,999.
Jake says: "41 million..."
Jake says: "We're next!"
Jake says: "Whew!"
Jake says: "Man, I thought I was gonna throw up!"
The number changes to 42 million.
Finn says: "That's us!"
Jake says: "Yaaay!"
Jake says: "Nooooooo!"
Finn says: "I'm gonna lose it!"
Finn says: "Waaaaaaaaaaahhh..."
Jake says: "Hey, do you know if there's an outlet anywhere?"
Two-headed Demon says: "No."
Jake says: "Do you know what this is all about?"
Two-headed Demon says: "No..."
Two-headed Demon says: "gross."
Finn stops screaming and is lying face down on the ground, exhausted.
Jake says: "What's going on, buddy?"
Jake says: "You givin' up?"
Finn says: "I guess."
Jake says: "You don't wanna just stick it out a little more?"
Finn says: "I don't know if my little boy heart can take it."
Jake says: "Listen, Finn."
Jake says: "Are you listening?"
Finn says: "Mm-hmm."
Jake says: "Your heart may be small, but it's strong as a bull donk."
Jake says: "And I know."
Jake says: "You can wait through this line so we can meet Hunson Abadeer and find out why we're here, and why we're in a pile of banianials, 'cause you're a champ, OK?"
Finn says: "Ok."
Finn says: "Well, at least I can see the end of the line, I think."
Finn says: "Let's wait the heck out of this line!"
Jake says: "That's it, champ."
Jake says: "Hehehehe, you're pretty pumped up."
Finn says: "I'm super pumped!"
Cloud says: "Does anyone need to go pee-pees?"
One demon raises his hand.
Cloud says: "Go ahead."
The demon runs ahead of line.
Okay, who's here with a question for Mr. Abadeer?
Finn and Jake raise their hands.
Finn says: "Oh, yeah, we've got questions."
The cloud destroys the demons who raised their hands.
Jake says: "Put your hand down, Finn!"
Finn says: "No way, dude, I got questions."
Jake goes away with Finn.
Finn says: "What the hey, Jake!"
Jake says: "It's not answering questions, man."
Jake says: "That thing is gonna bake our beans."
Finn says: "Hey, bloodmist cloud!"
Finn says: "What happened to us?"
Finn says: "Why can't we remember any—"
Finn says: "?"
Finn says: "Oh, it's gone."
Jake says: "Look."
The cloud goes inside a cave.
Jake says: "Ride me, partner."
Finn and Jake run to the cave.
Finn says: "Hey, cloud!"
Finn says: "Where's Abadeer?"
Finn says: "Whoa, look at all these paintings."
Finn says: "I think this is Hunson Abadeer's house."
The cloud arrives and reveals he's Abadeer.
Hunson Abadeer says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Hunson Abadeer!"
Hunson Abadeer says: "How dare you chumps trespass here!"
Jake says: "We just wanna go home, man."
Finn says: "Yeah, why'd you lock us up, Abadeer?"
Finn says: "When Marceline finds out about this, it's gonna stir up some heavy daddy-daughter issues."
Hunson Abadeer says: "NO ONE LEAVES THE NIGHTOSPHERE!"
Jake says: "Ah, come on, man!"
Hunson Abadeer attacks Finn and Jake.
Hunson Abadeer says: "NO ONE!"
Hunson Abadeer says: "NO ONE LEAVES THE NIGHTOSPHERE!"
Abadeer attacks Finn, but Finn blocks it with his sword. Jake tries to open a door, but Abadeer sees him.
Hunson Abadeer says: "Come with me, you juicy, little mortal soul!"
Jake uses his powers to squeeze himself through the keyhole, leaving behind his camera phone and banana. Jake opens the door suddenly, hitting Abadeer.
Jake says: "Finn!"
Finn runs through the door, while Jake hits Abadeer with the door again and gets his phone and the banana. Finn and Jake see the portal.
Finn says: "Oh, my lob, Jake!"
Finn says: "You found the portal!"
Abadeer smashes through the door. Finn and Jake scream and run into the portal. Abadeer attacks Finn again, and Jake wraps him up with his arm.
Jake says: "We don't want to hurt you, Abadeer."
Jake says: "Just let us go."
Abadeer laughs and throws Jake against the portal wall.
Abadeer tries to suck his soul, but Finn stabs him in the head. Black goo starts to squirt out.
Finn says: "What the—"
Finn says: "?"
Marceline emerges from Abadeer's head.
Finn says: "MARCELINE?!"
Jake says: "MARCELINE?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "!"
Marceline says: "I'm gonna close this portal."
Marceline says: "You're forbidden to come back to the Nightosphere!"
Finn says: "But Marcy, let us help you!"
Marceline says: "It's too late!"
Marceline says: "Stay away from me, FOREVVVEEERRRR!!!!"
Finn says: "Marceline's in trouble!"
Finn says: "We gotta go back and save her."
Jake says: "Alright, but I'm gonna take a shower first."
Jake leaves and Finn smells his armpits and the episode ends.
