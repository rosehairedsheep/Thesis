Penny says: "Of course it's not!"
Penny says: "I set you up to steal this chest of gold!"
Penny says: "I couldn't get past the barrier 'cause I'm a thief!"
Finn says: "But you're just a cute little girl!"
Penny says: "And, I'm a thief!"
Finn says: "Well, if this isn't yours, I'm gonna return it right now!"
Finn says: "Why can't I..."
Finn says: "?"
Penny says: "Because you stole something in the city!"

Hag says: "I was right."
Jake says: "Hey, that's enough from you, Hag!"
Jake says: "Finn?"
Finn says: "Don't touch me!"
Finn says: "I'm impure, man!"
Finn says: "Unfit to be a hero!"
Finn says: "Unfit to be your friend."
Jake says: "Come on, Finn, keep it together!"
Finn says: "No, Jake."
Finn says: "This is a one-way path, down a jacked-up road."
Finn says: "And I gotta walk it..."
Finn says: "alone."
Jake says: "I'm not gonna leave you alone in the city."
Jake says: "You're my buddy."
Jake says: "Besides, I stole these boots."
Jake says: "These super-big style boots."
Jake says: "So I'm just as dirty as you are, Finn."
Jake says: "We gotta walk this filthy path together!"
Finn says: "Then we shall embrace the darkness of this wicked city and use the methods of the criminal to seek vengeance on Penny."
Jake says: "Cowabunga!"
Finn says: "Cowabunga, indeed."

Finn says: "You made me steal."
Finn says: "And you took my purity."
Finn says: "You ruined me!"
Penny says: "I'm sorry, Finn."
Jake says: "Watch out, Finn!"
Finn says: "Thanks, dude."
Jake says: "Yeah, dude."
Penny says: "You may have soiled my purity, but I think you can still come out clean."
Penny says: "No!"
Penny says: "No!"

Finn says: "And you know what that means, Penny."
Finn says: "No more stealing!"
Penny says: "Never again."
Finn says: "Well, I think it's time for us to get the math out of here."
Penny says: "I'm going to miss you, Finn!"
