A yellow bird flies over a field, and lands on Raggedy Princess.
Raggedy Princess says: "Oh, hello bird."
Raggedy Princess says: "Hi, frog!"
Raggedy Princess says: "Did you come to hear my poems?"
Raggedy Princess says: "They're kinda long, so you have to walk slow."
Raggedy Princess says: "Or I could just read it fast!"
Raggedy Princess says: ""Late last night through fevered dreams, I heard some faint and feeble screams."
Raggedy Princess says: "They'll only last to likely leave."
Raggedy Princess says: "Was crying out in gruesome grief"."

Finn says: "Hey, Raggedy."
Finn says: "We'd love to stay and chat, but we're kind of on a mission here."
Finn says: "Maybe next time."
