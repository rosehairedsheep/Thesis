The episode begins with Finn, Jake, and the Swamp Giant falling from a great height. They are both gripping onto the giant.
Swamp Giant says: "AAAAH!"
Finn says: "Last chance, Swamp Giant!"
Finn says: "Tell us where you hid the Mini Queen!"
Swamp Giant says: "NEVER!!"
The three scream as they fall. Squeaking is heard.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Hi, Mini Queen!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "I've got 'er!"
Jake says: "Then hold my hand, dude!"
Jake says: "Whoooop!"
Jake inflates, making himself and Finn reach terminal velocity sooner and float gently to the ground.
Swamp Giant says: "Aaaah!"
Swamp Giant says: "Oof!"
The swamp giant hits the ground. Finn and Jake land on the flattened giant. Jake lets his air out and deflates.
Finn says: "My inflatable angel."
Jake says: "Heh heh heh."
Jake says: "How's the Mini Queen?"
Finn says: "I dunno."
Finn says: "Can't understand a word she says."
Finn says: "Okay..."
Finn says: "Didn't..."
Finn says: "catch any of that either."
The Mini Queen jumps on Jake's nose and then leaps away.
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "Do you know whose sword this is?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "This is the sword of Billy!"
Finn says: "Billy?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "BIIILLYYYYYY!!!"
Jake says: "BIIILLYYYYYY!!!"
Flashback.
Young Billy says: "Nothung!"
The sword comes to Billy and sparks lightning dramatically. The musical sequence begins.
Back in the present.
Finn says: "Oh, yeah!"
Finn says: "That was the most mathematical thing ever!"
Jake says: "Oh, yeah!"
Jake says: "Hahaha!"
Jake says: "He fought a bear!"
Finn says: "This is so cool!"
He attempts to pull out the sword. The ground cracks and makes a hole in the side of the mountain appear.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "It's Billy's legendary crack!"
They go inside. They gasp as they are treated with Billy's presence.
Billy says: "Hello."
Finn says: "It's him!"
Finn says: "It's him!!"
Jake says: "I know, I know!"
Jake says: "Be cool!!"
Billy says: "Yep."
Billy says: "It's me."
Finn says: "Man!"
Finn says: "I'm such a huge nerd for you!"
Finn says: "Please take us on as hero apprentices!"
Billy says: "What for?"
Finn says: "So that we could learn to kick evil's butt..."
Finn says: "just like you!"
Jake says: "I wanna be the dog version of you!"
Billy says: "Ahh, that'd be a waste of time."
Jake says: "Heh."
Jake says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "I-I'm a little paunchy..."
Jake says: "but I could do some sit-ups!"
Billy says: "No, I was talking about beating up monsters."
Billy says: "It's as pointless as a dog chasing his own tail."
Jake says: "Heh."
Jake says: "See, that's where you're wrong..."
Jake says: "'cuz watch!"
Jake says: "Ah..."
Jake says: "ah..."
Finn says: "What do you mean, "pointless?"
Finn says: "" We just saved the Mini Queen from a monster!"
Billy says: "You know where she is right now?"
Billy says: "She's probably being eaten by a different monster."
Billy says: "She's probably dead."
Billy says: "In my youth, I was much like you."
Billy says: "Motivated."
Billy says: "Headstrong."
Billy says: "Wore a silly, little outfit."
Billy says: "Even had a magic dog."
Billy points to his skeleton of a dog.
Billy says: "All my life, I've beaten on evil creatures."
Billy says: "But new evil keeps popping up."
Billy says: "Kicking their butts was a hopeless effort!"
Jake says: "What other way is there?"
Billy says: "Nonviolently."
Billy says: "Help people by being active in your community."
Finn says: "Nonviolently??"
Finn says: "I gotta try being nonviolent..."
Finn says: "the Billy way..."
Jake says: "Me, too!"
Finn says: "Billy, I won't let you down!"
Jake says: "I love you, Billy!"
Jake says: "I got a secret crush on you, Billy!"
They run away screaming. Billy sighs wearily. The scene shifts to the Grass Lands. Finn is riding on Jake.
Finn says: "This is gonna be tough, Jake."
Finn says: "I'll have to suppress my every warrior instinct."
Jake says: "Relax."
Jake says: "It'll be easy not to beat up on monsters and still help people."
Cobbler says: "Help!"
Cobbler says: "Help!"
Cobbler says: "Oh!"
Cobbler says: "Thank goodness!"
Cobbler says: "Heroes!"
Cobbler says: "I'm being chased by a horrible Dragon!"
Cobbler says: "Please, please help!"
Finn says: "Oh, uh..."
Jake says: "Oh..."
Cobbler says: "Act quickly!"
Cobbler says: "He's almost upon us!"
Jake says: "Sorry."
Jake says: "We don't beat stuff up anymore."
Cobbler says: "No, but please!"
Finn says: "Dude."
Finn says: "We gotta do something to help him."
Jake says: "I could teach 'im how to not be such a spaz."
Finn says: "Hey, Mister."
Finn says: "Besides being chased by a monster, what else is wrong?"
Cobbler says: "Well..."
Cobbler says: "I've been running all day."
Cobbler says: "I guess I'm pretty hungry."
Jake says: "Say no more."
Jake says: "Come on, Finn."
Cobbler says: "Where're you going?!"
Cobbler says: "!"
Jake says: "To make you somethin' to eat!"
They leave. The dragon arrives.
Cobbler says: "AAAH!!"
Cobbler says: "NO!!"
Cobbler says: "HELP!!"
The dragon attacks him by breathing fire. The scene transitions to a town where Finn and Jake are running a food stand.
Finn says: "I still feel weird about not fighting off that dragon."
Jake says: "Trust me."
Jake says: "This is a way better way to help 'im."
Jake says: "Gruel!"
Jake says: "Get your free gruel!"
Lady says: "What's this all about?"
Finn says: "Free gruel, ma'am."
Finn says: "I can't beat monster butts, but I can beat your hungry guts."
Finn says: "That's for sure!"
Lady says: "Hahaha!"
Lady says: "I didn't throw up!"
Lady says: "This gruel is very adequate."
Finn says: "YEAH!!!"
Cut to the other townspeople eating Finn and Jake's gruel.
Finn says: "This is great, Jake!"
Jake says: "Yeah, we're really helpin' people!"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Look who it is!"
The cobbler walks up to Finn and Jake. There are scorch marks on him.
Jake says: "Dude!"
Jake says: "You're alive!"
Cobbler says: "a week?"
Cobbler says: "So that's two, plus three, plus a week—"
Jake shushes him.
Jake says: "Dude."
Jake says: "Gruel."
Cobbler says: "Oh, thank you!"
Cobbler says: "AAAH!"
Cobbler says: "WHAT'S HAPPENING?!"
Cobbler says: "!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Oh, that's probably the stone skin potion I added to the recipe."
Finn says: "It gives your body the power to grow armor."
Cobbler says: "Wha?"
Cobbler says: "Ah..."
Cobbler says: "uh?!"
Cobbler says: "!"
More of his body becomes encased in stone. The cobbler strikes himself with a fork, and it has no effect. The cobbler panics.
Jake says: "Dude..."
Jake says: "how much of that potion did you use?"
Finn holds up five more empty potion bottles. The townspeople have grown armor as well. One of the townspeople's belly button starts shooting flames.
Townsperson says: "AAAAH!!"
Townsperson says: "MY TUMMY IS BREATHING FIRE!!!"
Finn says: "Geez..."
Finn says: "I thought people would like that."
Cobbler says: "Why?!"
Cobbler says: "!"
Cobbler says: "Why would anyone want that?!"
Cobbler says: "!"
Finn says: "So you can defend against evil monsters!"
Cobbler says: "You're supposed to beat up monsters so we don't have to defend ourselves!"
Finn says: "No, see?"
Finn says: "I'm helping you nonviolently!"
Cobbler says: "Helping?!"
Cobbler says: "!"
Cobbler says: "I can't even move my hands!"
Cobbler says: "I'm a cobbler!"
Cobbler says: "How'm I supposed to cobble with these useless chunk mitts?!"
Cobbler says: "!"
Finn says: "Sooo..."
Finn says: "the village needs the help of a new cobbler, eh?"
Finn says: "Hmmmmmm..."
Jake says: "Hmmmmmm..."
Cobbler says: "WHAT?!"
Cobbler says: "!"
Cobbler says: "NO—"
Cut to the shoe-repair shop.
Finn says: "Alright!"
Finn says: "We're cobblers!"
Cobbler says: "No, you're not!!"
Cobbler says: "You're just watching my shop while I go to the dermatologist!"
Cobbler says: "And don't try to cobble anything!"
Jake says: "What does "cobble" mean, anyway?"
Finn says: "I think it has something to do with shoes..."
Fine Lady says: "Excuse me!"
Fine Lady says: "Can you help me?"
Fine Lady says: "I need a broken heel fixed."
Fine Lady says: "I'm going to a fancy funeral."
Finn says: "Of course I'll help!"
Scene transition. Finn is hammering in the heel.
Finn says: "There!"
Finn says: "Pa-kow!!"
Fine Lady says: "Ah!"
She seems content with the repair. Suddenly, a blade comes out of the shoe. The lady makes a small gasp.
Finn says: "Now you can fight off evil if it shows up at the funeral!"
Jake says: "Did you fix that shoe with a magic nail?"
Finn says: "Maybe..."
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Cool!"
Fine Lady says: "I cannot go to the funeral in these!"
Fine Lady says: "..."
Fine Lady says: "And I'm not supposed to bring a guest."
Cobbler says: "GET OUT!!"
Cut to outside the shop.
Finn says: "Apparently, I suck at being nonviolent."
Jake says: "Dude, suckin' at somethin' is the first step towards bein' sorta good at somethin'."
Jake says: "You and I are like little baby Billys right now, and we're "sucking" on our first bottle of nonviolent milk!"
Finn says: "Totes."
Finn says: "I'll stop "pooping" my diaper."
Jake says: "Whoa, what?!"
Jake says: "!"
Townsperson with fire-spitting belly button says: "HELP!"
Townsperson with fire-spitting belly button says: "I NEED MEDICAL HELP!!"
Finn says: "Medical help?"
Finn says: "Hmmmmm..."
The scene shifts to the hospital where Finn and Jake are doctors.
Finn says: "How can we help?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I want surgery to make my body hot."
Finn says: "Yikes..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Yeah."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I know I'm already pretty smokin'..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "but I bought this swimsuit, so I need a swimsuit body."
Jake says: "You up for some serious plastic surgery?"
The Adventure Time logo swirls onto the screen.
Lumpy Space Princess comes out of the hospital with a new body, complete with legs.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Aw, yeah!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "This body's hot!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "And powerful!"
Jake says: "Dude, did you use a magic nail again?"
Finn says: "I've got three left!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Ohhhh..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What did you do to me??"
Finn says: "We transformed you into a cyborg fighter!"
Finn says: "That's hot, right?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "No one thinks this look is hot!!"
The cobbler suddenly walks up.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Huh?!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "!"
Her wheel activates, and she speeds into the cobbler. The townsperson with the flame-shooting belly button runs by again screaming.
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Jake..."
Finn says: "?"
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "."
Jake says: "Yeah..."
Jake says: "?"
Finn says: "I think us being nonviolent..."
Finn says: "is hurting people."
Finn says: "Man..."
Finn says: "Billy is gonna be so bummed out..."
Jake says: "Not if we run away, Finn!"
Jake says: "We'll have to live in halfway homes and be cannibals!"
Jake says: "We'll survive!"
Finn says: "I just wanna sit here and moan."
Jake says: "Then I'll moan with ya, buddy."
Finn says: "Thaaaanks, buuuddy..."
Jake says: "Yoooouuu'rrre weeeelcooome..."
Finn and Jake notice more cries for help.
Old Lady says: "AAAH!"
Old Lady says: "AAAH!"
Old Lady says: "HELP ME!!"
Swamp Giant says: "Hahaha!"
Swamp Giant says: "Relax!"
Swamp Giant says: "I'm just gonna grind you up!!"
Old Lady says: "AAAH!"
Old Lady says: "AAAH!"
Jake says: "Um..."
Jake says: "could you keep your evil-doing quiet?"
Jake says: "Finn is dealing with some heavy stuff over here."
Swamp Giant says: "It's not evil!!"
Swamp Giant says: "When they get this old, they wanna be ground up!!"
Swamp Giant says: "Hahaha!"
Swamp Giant says: "Right, you old bat?!"
Swamp Giant says: "!"
Old Lady says: "Help!!"
Finn sweats.
Swamp Giant says: "Right?!"
Swamp Giant says: "!"
Swamp Giant says: "?"
Finn strains, visibly in conflict.
Old Lady says: "Oooh!!"
Old Lady says: "Aaah!!"
Finn raises his fist.
Finn says: "Huh??"
Finn says: "A fist raised in righteous anger?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Oh, no!"
Finn says: "It's my fist!!"
Finn says: "I've gotta think of a way to save this old lady without punchin' this guy in the face!!"
Finn says: "Hmmm..."
Swamp Giant says: "Yeah, you wanna get ground up, right?!"
Swamp Giant says: "!"
Swamp Giant says: "?"
Finn says: "I couldn't think of anything..."
Old Lady says: "Whooo!"
Finn says: "POOP!!"
Finn says: "I saved her with violence..."
Old Lady says: "What's your huff, son?"
Finn says: "The greatest hero in the world told me to help people without being violent..."
Finn says: "and I promised I would do that and not let him down..."
Finn says: "but I did let 'im down."
Old Lady says: "Stuff and nonsense!"
Old Lady says: "You sure helped this old gal out!"
Old Lady says: "And you did it with violence!"
Old Lady says: "Like a true hero, you were born to punch evil creatures!"
Finn says: "Yeah..."
Finn says: "Yeah..."
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "YEAH!!"
Finn says: "That old lady has a point!"
Jake says: "Wait, didn't she say not to take advice from old peo—"
Finn says: "It's all so clear to me!"
Finn says: "Back to the cave of Billy!!"
Jake says: "Cha!!"
Scene transition to Billy's cave.
Finn says: "It's us again."
Jake says: "And we've got exciting news!"
Billy says: "Aw, I don't—"
Billy says: "I don't wanna buy anything."
Finn says: "Billy, an old lady told me that I shouldn't listen to you because you're old."
Finn says: "Also, that I should do what I was born to do..."
Finn says: "which is kickin' buns."
Billy says: "Don't you see how pointless it is?"
Billy says: "You know what's probably happening to that old lady right now?"
Billy says: "She's probably dead!"
Jake says: "She's right here."
Old Lady says: "Hello!"
Billy gasps.
Finn says: "We saved 'er, Billy."
Jake says: "You saved 'er."
Finn says: "I saved 'er, Billy."
Finn says: "I saved 'er using violence."
Finn says: "And that's not a bad thing, Billy!"
Finn says: "This old lady is alive because of these!"
Finn says: "And look how happy she is, man!"
Finn says: "She's elated!"
Billy says: "Hmm."
Billy says: "Perhaps you're right."
Jake says: "We're his heroes!!"
Billy looks at the old lady.
Billy says: "Huh..."
Billy says: "Hello."
Jake says: "Ha!"
Jake says: "Haha!"
Jake says: "I love you, Billy!!"
Billy says: "Get outta here!!"
Finn and Jake run out quickly, laughing heartily. As Finn and Jake happily wander off, Billy nods contentedly. The episode comes to a close.
