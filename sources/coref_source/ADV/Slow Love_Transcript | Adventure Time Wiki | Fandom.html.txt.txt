The episode begins in the Tree Fort. Finn is reading The Ooo Review and Jake is trying to play a game on BMO, who is playing up-tempo electronic music and dancing.
Jake says: "BMO, turn the music down."
Jake says: "BMO!"
Jake says: "Turn it down!"
Jake says: "Come on, BMO you're messing up my game!"
Jake says: "Hey, dude, can I borrow that paper?"
Finn says: "Mm-hmm."
Jake says: "Now go sit in the corner and think about your life."
BMO goes to corner and sits. Suddenly, a giant snail bursts through the wall.
Finn says: "Snail attack!"
Jake says: "Snail attack!"
They are rammed against the far wall.
Finn says: "Aaaaaah!"
Jake says: "Aaaaaah!"
Finn says: "Oof!"
Jake says: "Oof!"
Finn says: "Oh, sick!"
Jake says: "Ugh!"
Finn says: "Dude, how do you fight a snail?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Hold on!"
Jake says: "Don't make me use this, man!"
Snorlock says: "Salt?!"
Snorlock says: "!"
Snorlock says: "But I heard you guys were heroes."
Finn says: "We are heroes."
Finn says: "We thought you were trying to attack us."
Finn says: "Why'd you break in here all mad, squirting that juice all over us?"
Snorlock says: "It's not mad juice."
Snorlock says: "It's sad juice."
Snorlock says: "My name's Snorlock, and I'm sa-a-a-a-d!"
Finn says: "Stop squirting slime!"
Finn says: "Just tell us what's wrong!"
Snorlock says: "I need a girlfriend."
Snorlock says: "I have no one to love."
Finn says: "Jake, hero huddle."
Finn says: "What do you think?"
Jake says: "I think our house is all jacked up."
Finn says: "Yeah, but he's just an innocent goober looking for love."
Jake says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "Okay, let's help him."
Jake says: "But he's got to lay off the house."
Finn says: "Right!"
Finn says: "All right, man."
Finn says: "We'll help you hook up as long as youâ€”"
Snorlock bursts through the wall.
Snorlock says: "Yay!"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Aaah!"
Jake says: "Aaah!"
Finn & Jake climb to observation boat.
Jake says: "Lay off the house, man!"
Finn says: "All right!"
Finn says: "all right!"
Finn says: "We'll help you, dude!"
Finn says: "Just put our house back!"
Snorlock says: "Okay!"
Snorlock says: "Right after I get a girlfriend."
Finn says: "Aw!"
Finn says: "All right, you big crazy."
Finn says: "It's a deal."
Finn says: "Jake, what time is it?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "I don't know, but you're probably going to say..."
Finn says: "Lady time!"
Jake says: "Lady time!"
Finn says: "Okay, Snorlock, if you want a lady, you have to be yourself."
Snorlock says: "How do I be myself?"
Finn says: "Uh, how does he be himself, Jake?"
Jake says: "Just do whatever you want, man, as long as it comes from the inside."
Snorlock says: "Like sad juice?"
Finn says: "No!"
Jake says: "No!"
Jake says: "You keep that stuff inside you, brother."
Jake says: "You just got to talk to 'em."
Snorlock says: "Oh."
Snorlock says: "I never done that."
Jake says: "Finn, you see any hot mamas?"
Finn says: "Ummm..."
Finn says: "Baaaaaam!"
Jake says: "Go talk to her!"
Snorlock says: "Uhmm..."
Jake says: "Go talk to her!"
Snorlock says: "Okay."
Snorlock approaches Snail Lady.
Snail Lady #1 says: "Oh!"
Snail Lady #1 says: "Hello."
Snorlock says: "Hi."
Snail Lady says: "Mm."
Snail Lady says: "You seem like a reasonable male."
Snail Lady says: "We should go to a movie sometime."
Jake says: "He's got this."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Snorlock says: "Uhh..."
Snail Lady #1 says: "I like old movies."
Snorlock says: "Uh.."
Snorlock says: "uh uh..."
Snail Lady #1 says: "Um, are you okay?"
Snorlock says: "Aaaaaaaaah!"
Snorlock says: "Girlfriend!"
Snorlock says: "Girlfriend!"
Finn says: "Aaah!"

[Scene says: "inside of shaking house, objects are falling and breaking."
Snorlock says: "Girlfriend!"
Snorlock says: "Girlfriend!"
Snorlock says: "Girlfriend!"
Snorlock says: "Girlfriend!"
Snorlock says: "Girlfriend!"
Snorlock says: "Girlfriend!"
Snail Lady quickly retreats.
Finn says: "Dude!"
Finn says: "our house!"
Finn says: "We got to do something!"
Jake says: "Relax."
Jake says: "I got it."
Jake says: "Snorlock!"
Jake says: "Hey, Snorlock."
Jake says: "You okay, buddy?"
Jake says: "Went a little nuts there, guy."
Jake says: "You got to get that under control, 'cause you're scaring ladies and jacking up our house."
Snorlock says: "I'm sorry."
Snorlock says: "Are you gonna leave me?"
Jake says: "Aw, who could leave you?"
Jake says: "Come here, you big hot mess."
Finn says: "Break it up, you two!"
Finn says: "We have ladies to attend to!"
Jake says: "Yeah, the ladies."
Snorlock says: "Talking to ladies is hard."
Jake says: "No, it's not."
Jake says: "Check it out, Snorlock."
Jake says: "Finn, you be the guy snail, and I'll be..."
Jake says: "the chick snail."
Finn says: "Ugh!"
Finn says: "gross, Jake!"
Jake says: "Come on, man."
Jake says: "We're just pretending."
Jake says: "Do it for love."
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "I'll do it for this guy."
Finn says: "What's up, lady snail?"
Jake says: "Well, I'm just sitting here thinking about mating with snails."
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "I can't do this, man!"
Finn says: "I-am-out!"
Snorlock says: "I'll mate with you."
Jake says: "We're just role-playing, buddy."
Snorlock says: "Aww."
Jake says: "Here, Finn."
Jake says: "This time you be the chick and I'll be the snail dude."
Jake says: "Hey, baby."
Jake says: "What's up?"
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "WHA!"
Jake says: "Mm-mmm!"
Jake says: "Girl, you smell good."
Jake says: "Did you take a bath in rainbows and cupcakes?"
Jake says: "Say "yes"!"
Jake says: "Say "Yes"!"
Finn says: "Okay!"
Finn says: "Yes!"
Jake says: "See, Snorlock?"
Jake says: "Talking to ladies is easy."
Jake says: "Just act like me."
Snorlock approaches another Lady Snail.
Snorlock says: "Uh..."
Snorlock says: "girl, you smell good."
Snail Lady #2 says: "You can smell me?"
Snorlock nervously looks to Finn & Jake, who give thumbs up.
Snorlock says: "May I smell you more?"
Snail Lady #2 says: "Uh, okay."
Snorlock says: "Cupcakes..."
Snail Lady #2 says: "Uh, I have to go."
Snorlock says: "Did you take a bath?"
Snail Lady #2 says: "Don't ever talk to me again."
Snorlock says: "Please don't go!"
Snorlock says: "Don't go!"
Snorlock says: "Aww."
Jake says: "Aw, it's okay, buddy."
Jake says: "Come here and give us a hug."
Snorlock says: "Man, I wish you guys were ladies."
Finn says: "Uhh."
Jake says: "Stay focused, Snorlock."
Jake says: "You have any cool talents that ladies might like?"
Snorlock says: "No."
Jake says: "Umm, hey, Finn, teach him how to use swords."
Jake says: "The princesses always love this one."
Finn says: "Yah!"
Finn says: "yah!"
Finn says: "yah!"
Finn says: "yah!"
Finn says: "Yaaaah!"
Finn says: "hyah!"
Jake says: "Do you think you can do that, Snorlock?"
Snorlock says: "I don't know."
Jake says: "Hmm."
Jake says: "Maybe you're musical."
Jake says: "Can you do this?"
Jake says: "Try doin' all that."
Snorlock says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Jake says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Finn says: "yeah!"
Jake says: "yeah!"
Snail Lady #3 says: "My word, Eleanor!"
Snail Lady #3 says: "What is that alluring sound?"
Eleanor says: "I have no idea."
Jake says: "Yeah, Snorlock!"
Jake says: "Show us that talent!"
Finn says: "Whoo-hoo!"
A herd rushes over in the trio's direction.
Snail Ladies says: "Oh, my!"
Snail Ladies says: "What is that?"
Snail Ladies says: "What is that wonderful sound?"
Snail Ladies says: "Do I see swords?"
Finn says: "Jake, these chicks look pretty serious."
Jake says: "Let's just let Snorlock do his thing."
Jake says: "Go to it, buddy!"
Snail Ladies says: "Ahh!"
Snail Ladies says: "Ooh!"
Snail Ladies says: "Ahh."
Jake says: "Look at him go!"
Jake says: "Bringing in the ladies."
Finn says: "Uh, he's bringing in a lot of ladies."
Snail Ladies says: "Mm!"
[Scene says: "inside of shaking house, objects are falling and breaking, BMO is sliding around."
Finn says: "Snorlock!"
Finn says: "These ladies are ruining our tree house!"
Finn says: "Stop!"
Snorlock continues beatboxing as the Snail Ladies kiss him.
The continuous grinding wrecks the house even more.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Wedge, dude!"
Jake says: "It's no use, man."
Jake says: "It's stuck with snail slime."
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "Aah!"
Finn & Jake land hard on the ground and then stand up.
Finn says: "How are we gonna get our house back?"
Jake says: "Dude, I'm going in."
Finn says: "Wha?"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "You'll get slimed or grinded on!"
Jake says: "Hmph!"
He grabs the salt shaker and dives back outside to a waiting Finn.
Jake says: "Snorlock, I'm gonna give you till the count of three, mister!"
Snorlock continues.
Jake says: "One, two, three!"
Snorlock continues.
Jake says: "Fine."
Jake says: "I didn't want to have to do this."
The beatboxing slows as the salt approaches. Snorlock spots it and the beatboxing stops. The grain lands and leaves a huge burn mark.
Snorlock says: "Aaaaaah!"
Snorlock says: "Ow!"
Snorlock says: "ow!"
Snorlock says: "Owwwwwww!"
Snail Lady #4 says: "Oh, my gosh!"
Snail Lady #4 says: "He's naked!"
Snorlock says: "What?"
Snorlock says: "I'm naked?"
Snorlock says: "But I've never had a shell."
Jake says: "Snorlock, you never had a shell?"
Jake says: "That means you're not naked."
Jake says: "You're a slug!"
Snorlock says: "Me, a slug?"
Finn says: "Yeah, man."
Finn says: "That's why you have trouble with snail chicks."
Finn says: "You need slug chicks."
Snorlock says: "I don't known any slug chicks."
Slug Lady says: "Actually, I-I'm not really a snail."
Slug Lady says: "I'm a slug."
Slug Lady says: "My shell's made of peppermint."
Finn says: "That's gross!"
Jake says: "I don't know why they have to make out so close to our house."
Finn says: "I don't know."
Finn says: "Come on, let's finish rebuilding it."
Finn says: "I got some ear plugs you can borrow."
Up-tempo electronic music plays.
Finn says: "Where's that music coming from?"
BMO says: "Go!"
BMO says: "go!"
BMO says: "go!"
BMO says: "go!"
Finn says: "BMO!"
Finn says: "Get over here and help us rebuild the tree house."
Jake says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "You live here, too!"
Finn says: "Oh, BMO!"
Jake says: "Oh, BMO!"
The episode ends with BMO getting sprayed by slime.
