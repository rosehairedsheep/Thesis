Episode begins with a zoom through the Galaxy of Flavors.
Scene changes to Candy Kingdom.
Princess Bubblegum says: "My head will be decapitated if the tarts don't make it to the ceremony."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I only trust one guy to deliver them..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "the Royal Tart Toter."
Royal Tart Toter appears, then zooms back to reveal it is just a picture of him.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "He's magnificent!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "He used to be, but he's gone mad and old."
Princess Bubblegum says: "So he can't deliver the tarts anymore."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Cinnamon Bun offered to fill the position, but he's kind of..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "half-baked."
Cinnamon Bun says: "Hey Princess!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Here I go!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "I'm stuck."
Finn says: "Princess, let us deliver the tarts."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Are you sure Finn?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "This is really important."
Finn says: "I'll do anything it takes to keep you alive and safe."
Finn says: "We won't let you down."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Well..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I accept your offer."
Scene changes to a factory where Jelly Bean People are working.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Welcome to the Tartorium!"
Finn says: "They're so beautiful."
Princess Bubblegum says: "No, boys."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Those are the reject tarts, full of imperfections."
Princess Bubblegum says: "safely packed into one of my anti-gravity tote chambers."
She hands them the chamber.
Finn says: "Tote sweet!"
Jake says: "Tote sweet!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Now, I want you to tote those tarts through that tunnel."
Princess Bubblegum says: "The Royal Tart Path takes you directly to the Royal Congressional Hall in the Bad Lands."
Princess Bubblegum says: "The path is really safe and well protected, but keep your eyes open for any sign of danger, okay?"
Finn says: "Mmm hmm."
Jake says: "Yep."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Good."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Now here's your map."
Finn says: "Hey Princess, what are all these bubbling chemicals all over the place?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "That's paralyzing potion, Finn!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Don't touch it."
Princess Bubblegum says: "It'll paralyze you forever!"
Finn says: "Oh."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Thank you, boys."
Jake says: "All right, let's hit it."
Finn says: "Wait."
Finn says: "I got a sick plan!"
Finn says: "Go!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Okay."
Cinnamon Bun says: "Bye!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Bye-bye!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Bye-bye!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Bye!"
Finn says: "Goodbye!"
Finn says: "You'll be fine!"
Finn says: "Hahaha!"
Jake says: "Bye!"
Jake says: "Goodbye!"
All three say that at the same time.
Jake says: "Heh, that was fun, but why'd you do it?"
Finn says: "Look, everyone expects the tarts to on that Royal Tart Path."
Finn says: "Cinnamon Bun will be our decoy while we take the one path no thief expect a tart toter to take: the Desert of Doom!"
The scene changes to the Desert of Doom in the Bad Lands, with Finn and Jake walking with Anti-Gravity Chamber.
Jake says: "I guess this is it."
Finn says: "Huh, not as scary as I thought it'd be."
Jake says: "Yeah, man, mostly just looks empty."
Jake says: "I mean, what thief would ever hang out here?"
Jake says: "There's nothing to steal!"
Finn says: "You know, I think my plan might be kinda brilliant."
Finn says: "I mean, I'm not saying I'm the brilliant, but it's a pretty brilliant plan, I think."
Jake says: "True, true."
Jake says: "This place is perfect for toting tarts."
Finn says: "Yeah, and the Back-Rubbing Ceremony is right over those mountains."
Finn says: "This tart tote is gonna be a total tart walk."
Jake says: "Heheheh, yeah."
Jake says: "Ohh, wait!"
Jake says: "Hold up!"
Finn says: "What is it?"
Jake says: "Shh."
Jake says: "It's a campfire—"
Jake says: "close by."
Finn says: "Does it smell like a tart thief's campfire?"
Jake says: "Maybe."
Finn says: "Better check it out—"
Finn says: "can't be too careful."
The scene switches to three hobos roasting a sausage.
Taddle says: "D-d-don't burn it now, Grimby."
Grimby says: "Hush."
Grimby says: "I ain't gon' burn it."
Finn and Jake see this and hide.
Finn says: "Crud!"
Finn says: "I was sure we'd be safe in the Desert of Doom!"
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "Whatcha sayin'?"
Finn says: "Those are dirty tart burglers!"
Jake says: "I think they're just dirty hobos."
Finn says: "No, man, they are cold-blooded tart destroyers and we have to get them before they get us."
Jake says: "Why?"
Finn says: "They're gonna kill Princess Bubblegum by stealin' our tarts!"
Jake says: "Oh, yeah."
The scene switches to the hobos.
Taddle says: "But how come JJ gets to hold it, Grimby?"
Jake appears, transformed into a monster, and the hobos are scared.
Jake says: "Rawr!"
Grimby tries to eat the beans but Finn hits him.
Jake kicks JJ.
Finn says: "Yeah, go on, get!"
Finn says: "We'll mash you up crazy!"
Finn says: "You!"
Finn says: "Listen up and tell your friends: the next time you wanna steal one of our tarts—"
Finn says: "!"
Grimby says: "You got tarts?"
Finn says: "You know we do!"
Finn says: "And the next time you want to steal one—"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "That thing's gettin' the tarts!"
Jake reaches for him, but JJ jet-packs away with the tarts.
Finn says: "Son of a—"
Finn says: "."
JJ lands in the distance, and the other hobos approach him.
Taddle says: "We eatin' good tonight!"
Grimby says: "We eatin' good tonight!"
Jake returns to its normal shape and observes the tart pack.
Jake says: "Uh-oh, man, he got, like, five or six!"
Finn says: "But..."
Finn says: "my brilliant plan."
Holo-Pendant says: "Incoming transmission from Princess Bubblegum."
Finn says: "What the—"
Finn says: "?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hey, Finn."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm just checking in using the holo-pendant."
Princess Bubblegum says: "How are my tarts doing?"
Finn says: "They're, um..."
Finn says: "th-they're—"
Jake says: "They're radical!"
Jake says: "No tart problems here!"
Finn says: "Uhh, yeah!"
Finn says: "Right!"
Finn says: "Everything's, uh—"
Finn says: "bazoobs!"
Finn says: "Oh, look, something is eclipsing the sun."
Finn says: "It's so dark now."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, well, I'll see you soon enough!"
Holo-Pendant says: "Transmission complete."
Jake says: "I think the plan went awry."
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "All this was just some freak bad luck, but we still got some tarts and the princess is still safe."
Jake says: "Oh, yeah, and who knows what kind of freaky things would have happened if we took the Royal Tart Path?"
Jake says: "Heheh, old Cinnamon Bun's probably got his hands full."
The scene changes to the Cinnamon Bun on the Royal Tart Path.
Cinnamon Bun says: "Bye!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Goodbye!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Bye-bye!"
Royal Tart Path Guard 1 says: "Hello!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Hello!"
Royal Tart Path Guard 1 says: "Shall I hold that for you, sir?"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Okay."
They approach another guard.
Royal Tart Path Guard 2 says: "Shall I hold that for you, sir?"

Several guards in a row help as Cinnamon Bun continues whistling.

Royal Tart Path Guard 2 says: "Okay."

Royal Tart Path Guard 7 says: "Okay."
The scene changes to the Bad Lands.
Finn says: "You know what?"
Finn says: "Even though it totally wasn't our fault, it's probably for the best that we lost those tarts."
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "How?"
Finn says: "Well, it's like a reminder to really stay sharp and play it extra safe."
They leave the skull.
Finn says: "For instance, take this scary cavern, here."
Finn says: "No sane person would ever bring a tart down there."
Finn says: "So..."
Jake says: "So no thieves!"
Finn says: "Exactly."
Jake says: "You are on a roll today, buddy!"
They enter the cave.
The scene inside the cave, everything is completely dark, only you can see the eyes of the characters who move through it.
Finn says: "P."
Finn says: "U."
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Yeah, P."
Jake says: "U."
Jake says: "!"
A deep sniff is heard.
Finn says: "Jake?"
Jake says: "Yeah?"
Finn says: "Hey, man, did you just, like, sniff my butt?"
Jake says: "Uh, just now?"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "No."
Finn says: "Huh."
Finn says: "Alright."
They keep walking, and Jake hums a tune.
Jake says: "Hmm."
Jake says: "Hey, Finn?"
Finn says: "Yeah, Jake?"
Jake says: "Did you just, uh, lick me—"
Jake says: "all the way up my arm?"
Finn says: "No."
Jake says: "Hmm."
Jake says: "Strange."
Finn says: "Jake, let me see those matches."
Finn lights a match and they realize they are surrounded by Chuds.
The scene goes black while Finn and Jake scream and fighting noises are heard. They get thrown out of the cave.
Jake says: "Uh-oh!"
Jake says: "Man, we got got!"
Jake says: "There's only two left!"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Holo-Pendant says: "Incoming transmission from Princess Bubblegum."
Finn says: "Aaaaah!"
Finn throws the Holo-Pendant.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hello?"
Finn says: "We blew it, man!"
Finn says: "My plan sucked—"
Finn says: "it sucked all along—"
Finn says: "but I was blinded by my hubris!"
Finn says: "Now PB is gonna get got, and it's all my fault!"
Jake says: "Whoa, whoa, take it easy, buddy."
Jake says: "We've still got two whole tarts left."
Jake says: "PB is gonna be fine."
A butterfly lands on the tart pack.
Finn says: "You really think so?"
Jake says: "Yeah, why not?"
Butterfly says: "Hey!"
Butterfly says: "Keep off them tarts!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Butterfly Bandit says: "I said back off of them tarts!"
Butterfly Bandit says: "Are you an imbecile?!"
Butterfly Bandit says: "!"
Finn says: "But I—"
Bandit Butterfly says: "Right the bazoobs now!"
Jake says: "Finn, he's got a laser gun!"
The butterfly shoots, and Finn & Jake move away.
Bandit Butterfly says: "Yeah!"
Bandit Butterfly says: "That's it."
Bandit Butterfly says: "Alright,  now I gotta book it to Nana's for brunch!"
Bandit Butterfly says: "See youse later!"
Finn says: "It's over."
Finn says: "PB's gonna get croaked."
Jake says: "Mmm, yeah—"
Jake says: "or..."
Jake says: "we could smash in there and stop Congress from chopping her head off."
Finn says: "You're right!"
Finn says: "Jake, let's go save Princess Bubblegum!"
The scene changes to the Royal Congressional Hall.
Finn and Jake enter.
Backrubbers says: "Chop!"
Backrubbers says: "Chop!"
Backrubbers says: "Chop!"
Backrubbers says: "Chop!"
Finn and Jake see Princess Bubblegum bring her face to the table while a Backrubber raises his axe. Finn's eyes go big in terror.
Finn says: "NOOOOO!!!!"
The guy with the ax makes the cut.
Finn says: "Aaaaah!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Huh?"
The ax is revealed to have merely chopped a tart.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Another perfectly chopped tart!"
The crowd cheers and Princess Bubblegum takes a picture.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Let the annual Back-Rubbing Ceremony begin!"
Finn says: "Dude, they were just slicing tarts!"
Jake says: "And there's Cinnamon Bun over there!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "He must have delivered the decoys..."
Pause.
Finn says: "the ones we poisoned!"
Jake says: "the ones we poisoned!"
The princess is about to eat a tart.
Finn says: "Nooo!"
Finn slaps the tart away.
Finn says: "Princess, don't eat that tart!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Okay!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Jeez, Finn, I won't eat that tart."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'll eat this other tart instead!"
She stuffs it in her mouth.
Finn says: "No, Princess, no!"
She becomes immobilized.
Finn says: "The princess has been paralyzed!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm not paralyzed!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm gripped with the flavor!"
Finn says: "That means we must have been carrying the poisoned tarts all along!"
The Butterfly bandit is shown with a tart, falling through the sky, paralyzed.
Finn says: "Yep!"
Finn says: "All part of my master plan."
Jake says: "Psht!"
Jake says: "Whatever, man."
Jake says: "Heh heh."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Excuse me!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "What is this about poisoned tarts and alternate plans?"
Finn says: "I-I—"
Finn says: "alright, here it comes."
Finn says: "You oughtta give this toter job to Cinnamon Bun."
Finn says: "He's the real hero."
Finn says: "I'm sorry for not following your instructions and for lying to you about it."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, Finn, I forgive you—"
Princess Bubblegum says: "'cause I lied to you, too!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "They weren't going to decapitate me; I just said that so you guys wouldn't eat the tarts!"
Finn says: "Oh!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "So I guess we're even."
She hugs Finn, and he blushes.
Finn says: "Uhh, yeah, I guess so."
The Royal Tart Toter bursts in, holding a squirrel and a hen.
Royal Tart Toter says: "Ladies and gentlemen!"
Royal Tart Toter says: "The Royal Tarts have arrived."
Princess Bubblegum says: "The old Tart Toter!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Nobody move!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "He can't see or hear, but he can feel your movement."
Royal Tart Toter says: "Hello?"
Royal Tart Toter says: "Eat my tarts?"
Royal Tart Toter says: "This cosmic dance of bursting decadence and withheld permissions twists all our arms collectively, but if sweetness can win—"
Royal Tart Toter says: "and it can—"
Royal Tart Toter says: "then I'll still be here tomorrow, to high-five you yesterday, my friends."
Royal Tart Toter says: "Peace."
Lumpy Space Princess grabs a passing donut, while the Royal Tart Toter drifts into the distance.
Finn says: "Sheesh!"
Episode ends.
