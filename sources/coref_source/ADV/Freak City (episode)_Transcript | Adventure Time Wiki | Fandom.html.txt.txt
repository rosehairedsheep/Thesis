Episode begins in Yellow Forest. There are graves littered on the grass.
Birds are chirping; Finn and Jake walking.
Finn says: "Walking, walking, walking – hambone break!"
Jake says: "WooHoo!"
Jake says: "Hey!"
Finn starts playfully slapping Jake.
Jake says: "Get away from me."
Jake says: "Quit it."
A mysterious man is lying on the grass in tattered clothing.
Man says: "Food for a poor old man?"
Finn and Jake are surprised.
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Man says: "So you got any, kid?"
Man says: "Food?"
Finn searches through backpack, finds a cube of sugar.
Finn says: "I got this little piece of sugar."
Jake says: "Whoa, man."
Jake says: "Maybe helping this starving homeless guy is wrong thing to do."
Finn says: "Why?"
Jake says: "I don't know."
Finn says: "A hero always helps someone in need and besides he's probably a secret elf who will reward us for being nice."
Finn says: "Here you go, buddy."
Man says: "Magic Man!"
Magic Man little riff.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Aw, yeah!"
Jake says: "He's magic!"
Jake says: "I didn't expect this."
Jake says: "Think happy thoughts… Little, cute, bees, little babies, tiny, tiny bunnies."
Finn says: "what is wrong with you, Magic Man?!"
Finn says: "!"
Magic Man says: "You gave me that candy now I'll do you a favor in return."
Magic Man says: "A magic favor."
Jake says: "Whoa, dude!"
Magic Man says: "..."
Magic Man says: "For you!"
Finn says: "why did you do that!"
Finn says: "?"
Magic Man says: "Because on this day, a magical life lesson comes to you."
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "Change me back."
Magic Man says: "Not until you appreciate what a jerk I am."
Magic Man says: "Wazoo!"
Finn says: "What the heck, man??"
Finn says: "What kind of deal is that?"
Finn says: "I help somebody out and they make me a stinky foot."
Jake says: "You smell pretty good."
Finn says: "Get off of me, man!"
Finn says: "I can't be a hero if I'm a big good-smelling foot!"
Jake says: "Maybe you're looking at this magic gift all wrong."
Jake says: "Now that you're a huge foot you can kick evil's butt, like, way more times as hard."
Jake says: "You're 100% kick, man!"
Finn says: "Why are you being so level-headed about this?"
Jake says: "Don't be a siss, Finn."
Jake says: "Here, c'mon kick my butt."
Finn says: "You're the SISS, siss!"
Finn says: "Augh!"
Jake says: "Ouch!"
Jake says: "oooh!"
Jake says: "Ouch."
Jake says: "See, man."
Jake says: "Let's give your foot body a shot."
Finn says: "No, dude!"
Finn says: "I wanna go find that magic man and get my body back!"
Jake as Finn says: "Ok, I will."
Jake says: "Awesome!"
Jake says: "Dude you will never regret this."
Jake says: "Hahaha!"
[Next scene says: "still in the forest."
[Next scene says: "Finn is upside-down and attached to some sort of spring catapult with a trigger."
Jake says: "Okay, when the next monster comes along, he'll step on that trigger over there, sending your giant foot body into the monster's crotch!"
Finn says: "This sucks, dude."
Jake says: "Shhh!"
Monster says: "Our crotch!"
Monster says: "our evil crotch!!"
Jake says: "Hahaha!"
Jake says: "What'd I tell you?"
Jake says: "You're a great hero!"
Jake says: "Let's go set up some more crotch catapults so we can laugh and be heroes."
Finn says: "No, Jake."
Finn says: "Let's find that Magic Man."
Jake says: "Finn, being an enormous crotch-kicking foot is a gift."
Jake says: "Don't scorn a gift."
Indistinct shouting is heard; they see Rump Town on fire.
Jake says: "Town on fire!"
Jake says: "This looks like a job for foot Finn stomping ability!"
Finn says: "But I-I can't even bend these big fat toes, man."
Jake says: "You can do it, Finn."
Jake says: "What'd I teach you, dude?"
Finn says: "Not to scorn the kicking of people in the crotch?"
Jake says: "You got it!"
Jake says: "Now I'm gonna go rescue all the babies in town  Get your hero on, dude!"
Jake throws Finn towards Rump Town. Finn flies through the air.
Finn says: "Aaahh!"
More shouting and running townspeople. Finn land in the middle of the town.
Finn says: "Uhh."
Finn says: "Okay, you can do this, Finn."
Finn struggles to move his body and falls on top of a small fire.
Finn says: "It's hot!"
Finn says: "Oh, man, I'm smoking hot!"
Finn says: "Please, help me out!"
Finn says: "I can't move!"
Townspeople gather around Finn, angrily.
Townsperson says: "It's another one of those freaks!"
Townsperson says: "He probably started this fire!"
Townsperson says: "Throw him under the bridge with the others!"
Townspeople pick up Finn and carry him off to the bridge.
Townspeople says: "Get rid of the freak."
Townspeople says: "Freak!"
Townspeople says: "Freak!"
Finn is thrown off the bridge.
Finn says: "Unh!"
Finn says: "I'm not a freak, I'm a hero."
Jake calls out to Finn. Jake runs toward Finn with his arms full of babies.
Jake says: "Finn!"
Finn says: "Jake, how'd you find me?"
Jake says: "Oh, I can sense when you're about to cry."
Jake says: "It's like a mother/daughter thing."
Finn says: "get my body back now!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Jake walks toward the underside of the bridge.
Jake says: "Ew, it's blocking out your good foot smell."
Finn says: "Get back here!"
Jake says: "Ugh, it—"
Jake says: "it smells like vomit on fire."
Jake says: "It's like fancy cheese in an old guy's mouth."
Behind Jake there is a Cyclops creature with no legs or arms under the bridge. It hops towards Jake.
Cyclops says: "Welcome, travelers."
Jake jumps in the air, surprised.
Jake says: "Ahh!"
Jake picks up Finn.
Cyclops says: "I am Gork, leader of Freak City."
Cyclops says: "Ah, I can see one of you has felt the Magic Man's touch."
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "You know that guy?"
Gork walks back underneath the bridge. Finn and Jake follow.
Gork says: "I will tell you all that I know."
Under the bridge, Gork vomits lava on the ground that turns into fire. The fire illuminates the makeshift caveFreak City. There are other creatures seen under the bridge.
Gork says: "We are the accursed ones, all once normal guys and gals who crossed paths with the Magic Man."
Gork says: "But, please, make yourselves at home."
Gork says: "Would you like something to drink?"
Jake says: "Do you have any orange juice?"
Gork says: "No."
Gork says: "Well, uh, I don't know."
Gork says: "Maybe."
Gork says: "Uh, I don't think so."
Gork says: "I'll go check."
Gork goes off in search of orange juice.
Jake says: "Yo, Finn, this place is really bumming me out."
Jake says: "Let's get out of here."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "No, dude."
Finn says: "These guys might be my only hope of finding the Magic Man."
Gork comes back with orange juice.
Gork says: "Hey, we actually do have orange juice."
Jake starts drinking the juice.
Finn says: "Thanks for being cool and all, but what do you know about this Magic Man?"
Finn says: "How do we catch him?"
Gork says: "Oh, he can't be caught."
Gork says: "He's got magic and we're worthless freaks."
Gork says: "We can't ever beat him."
Gork says: "So we've gather here to wallow in our self-pity."
Finn says: "But don't y'all even want to try?"
Kim says: "Eh, no."
Finn says: "Why not?"
Finn says: "You're all totally miserable here."
Zap says: "Ugh."
Zap says: "It's a living."
Finn says: "No, it's not, Zap!"
Finn says: "It's not a living!"
Finn says: "It's dookie diapers!"
Finn says: "I don't want to be a foot!"
Trudy says: "Well, get used to it."
Trudy says: "We did."
Gork falls to his side.
Jake walks to a pile of garbage, sits down and gets comfortable.
Jake says: "To accept what fate has given you  and stay a miserable foot."
Jake says: "Gork, can we stay here in this pile of trash and rats forever?"
Gork says: "Yeah, man."
Gork says: "Do it up."
Jake says: "Here we go."
Finn says: "Jake, stop screwing around."
Finn says: "You're gonna make me give into depression."
Finn says: "I…—"
Finn says: "and rot like the rest of you."
Jake says: "Stay a foot!"
Jake says: "Stay a foot!"
Jake says: "Stay a foot!"
Finn closes his eyes and begins to daydream. Song begins.
Finn says: "♫ Is this really my life?"
Is this how my story ends?
Finn is in space with his foot body.
Bein' in this body,.
Seems like a battle that I cannot win.
Finn is trapped in a neon cube.
Maybe I should lay my head down slow,.
And sleep until it's all over,.
Finn lays his head on his hands. The cube disappears but leaves lines that bisect Finn.
Is this the end,.
The pieces of Finn break apart and move through space. Finn opens his eyes and is back in the cave.
Heck no! Darn it, no!
This isn't how I go!
Finn picks himself up.
I'm gonna kill it! I'm gonna kick life's butt,.
And win it, to win it.
I'm gonna take life's name,.
And spit on it, and kick it!
Spits and hops towards Gork.
Life can just go eat it,.
Finn says: "Get up, Gork!"
Gork says: "Huh?"
Gork says: "Why?"
And waste away,.
You better get up, Gork, or I'll kick you up,.
Today's the day! ♪.
Gork says: "Whoa."
Gork says: "Okay man, just be cool."
Finn says: "♫ And I'm not gonna be cool!"
Finn kicks Gork.
Finn kicks Trudy then kicks Kim.
Get up, Trudy! Get up, Kim!
I'm not gonna let you rot! ♫.
Finn hops to Jake.
Jake says: "Hey, Finn."
Finn says: "♫ Ja-a-a-ke, stop tellin' me to enjoy, bein' a foot, and get out of that trash!"
Jake says: "Heh heh."
Jake says: "I can't take you seriously when you're singing, man."
Finn says: "Get up!"
Kicks Jake into the air.
Jake says: "Ahh!"
Finn says: "♫All of you make me sick!"
I'll fix you with my kicks!
Gonna reconstruct y'all's self-worth,.
Kicks them all out of the cave and into the light.
Brick by emotional brick. ♫.
Gork says: "Wait, Finn!"
Finn kicks them into a pile. Gork is on top of Trudy and Kim and Zap are at his sides.
Gork says: "Hey, stop it, man!"
Gork says: "We don't like touching each other."
Finn kicks them all except Jake and is puzzled.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Gork, Trudy. Kim, Zap, Wee Wee and Gorflax are all clumped together.
Gork says: "Please, man."
Finn says: "Wait a second."
Finn says: "Kim, get underneath Trudy."
Kim says: "No, man."
Kim says: "Please."
Kim says: "I freakin' hate Trudy."
Finn says: "Kim, I will destroy you!"
Kim says: "Okay, Okay!"
Jake walks up to Kim.
Jake says: "Yeah, do it, Kim."
Finn says: "Yes!"
Finn says: "Now for me  Look at us!"
Gork, Trudy. Kim, Zap, Finn, Wee Wee and Gorflax are joined together to make a single body.
Jake says: "Whoa!"
They walk to a puddle and look at their reflection.
Gork says: "We're like a big, normal guy."
Kim says: "Oh, Finn, thank you."
Finn says: "Word!"
Finn says: "Now let's go wreck up that Magic Man!"
They jump up and down excitedly.
Jake says: "Let me get in on this."
Jake says: "I'll form the pants."
Off-screen.
Magic Man says: "Food."
Finn gasps. Magic Man is in his hobo disguise.
Magic Man says: "Y'all got any food?"
Magic Man says: "That's right."
Magic Man says: "It is I, the magic Man!"
They all shout.
Magic Man says: "Come on, apple grease!"
Magic Man says: "What are you gonna do?"
Zap punches Magic Man.
Magic Man says: "Ohh!"
Zap says: "We're not afraid."
Magic Man says: "Are you sure about that?"
Finn says: "You're darn right we are!"
Gork vomits lava at Magic Man but it is deflected.
Finn says: "Give us our bodies back!"
Finn kicks Magic Man into a pile.
Magic Man says: "Why should I?"
Magic Man says: "You still act like a hero only so you can get what you want."
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "You were trying to teach us to be kind without expecting anything return."
Finn says: "I should've given you that sugar cube without even thinking about a reward."
Magic Man says: "Wrong!"
Finn says: "Ah, geez!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Finn says: "You've gifted us nothing but heartache, Magic Man!"
Finn says: "What is the life lesson in that?!"
Finn says: "!"
Magic Man says: "Yes, my children, you are so close to the answer."
Finn says: "Answer this!"
They jump on top of Magic Man. He is stuck underneath Finn's foot body.
Kim says: "Get his eyes!"
Kim says: "Cut him in the eyes!"
Finn says: "I wish I'd never been nice to you 'cause you're just a big jerk!"
Magic Man says: "Oh, yes, that's it!"
Magic Man says: "You're welcome!"
Finn says: "Man, I frickin' hate that guy."
Finn says: "But at least now we can all go back to our regular lives."
Gork, Kim, Trudy, Wee Wee and Gorflax are still voluntarily linked as a single body – even though they have their original bodies back.
All says: "Bye, Finn!"
All says: "Thank you!"
They wave and walk off-screen.
Finn says: "Oh, okay."
Finn says: "Bye, guys."
Finn says: "See you, later."
Finn says: "Wait, so, what was the lesson we just learned?"
Jake says: "Maybe it was, don't give your sugar to jerks."
Finn says: "Speaking of jerks, what the blubbins, man?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Why wouldn't you help me turn back into a boy?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "I said, I kind of always wanted to be a foot myself."
Finn says: "You could be a foot right now."
Finn says: "I saw you change into a foot twice yesterday."
Finn and Jake start walking away.
Jake says: "It's complicated, man."
Jake says: "You'll understand when you're older."
Episode ends.
