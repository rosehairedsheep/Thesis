The episode begins in an area filled with bones where Finn and Jake are playing.
Finn says: "Hahahaha!"
Finn says: "Here I go!"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Whoo-hoo!!"
Finn hits the ground, and he, Jake, and many bones are propelled into the air. Marceline watches them discreetly.
Marceline says: "Hmm..."
Finn and Jake land.
Finn says: "Awesome!"
Finn says: "Someone needs our help!"
Finn runs to the source of the crying. Jake spits out a bone and follows. They find Marceline talking to an old man.
Marceline says: "What is it about "henchman for life" that you don't understand?"
Old Man Henchman says: "Oh, come on!"
Finn says: "Dude!"
Finn says: "It's Marceline the Vampire Queen!"
Jake screams and cowers in fear.
Old Man Henchman says: "Can't you find the compassion to release this poor old body?"
Marceline says: ""Henchman for life" means, "henchman for life!!"
Finn says: "You still petrified of vampires?"
Jake's head has sunk into his body.
Jake says: "No..."
Jake says: "I'm not..."
Marceline says: "Fall on the ground for me!"
Old Man Henchman says: "Yes, Mistress."
Marceline says: "Now cry for me!"
Old Man Henchman says: "Okay."
Old Man Henchman says: "I don't want to cry, but I shall cry for you."
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Cut that out!"
Marceline says: "Oh!"
Marceline says: "If it isn't my favorite little goodie-two-shoes Finn!"
Finn says: "Stop making this poor old dude cry!"
Marceline says: "I can make him do whatever I want."
Marceline says: "Watch."
Marceline says: "Henchman, amuse me."
The old man balances himself on his cane.
Finn says: "Stop it!"
Marceline says: "Now hop around in a circle."
The old man hops around on his cane. The tip breaks and he falls down.
Finn says: "Oh, no."
Finn says: "Don't worry, sir."
Finn says: "I'll see to it you get set free."
Marceline says: "Oh, and how're ya gonna pull that off, hero?"
Finn says: "I'll do what I need to."
Finn says: "I'll even take his place!"
Jake says: "Dude, what?!"
Jake says: "!"
Marceline says: "Do you mean it?"
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "well..."
Finn says: "Heck yeah!"
Marceline says: "Deal!"
Marceline says: "Old henchman, you're free."
Old Man Henchman says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Jake says: "What're you doing, man?"
Marceline says: "Hey, Jake..."
Marceline says: "."
Marceline says: "BLEH!!"
Jake says: "EEH!"
Finn says: "I couldn't watch that old man suffer, Jake."
Finn says: "My code of honor wouldn't allow it."
Jake says: "Rrrr..."
Jake says: "HEY!"
Marceline says: "Yes, Jake?"
Marceline says: "What would you like to talk about?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Jake says: "AAAH!"
Jake says: "I wanna help you outta this, man, but..."
Jake says: "she scares the filling out of my doughnut."
Jake says: "Let's just leave."
Finn says: "I can't."
Finn says: "As a hero, I'm bound by my  WOOOOORD!!"
Jake says: "FINN!"
Jake says: "Don't worry, dude!"
Jake says: "I'll figure something out!!"
Scene transition; Marceline and Finn are flying through the air.
Marceline says: "You're lucky, Finn."
Marceline says: "Your first job as henchman is to help me feed."
Finn says: "Feed?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "What does she mean?"
Finn says: "L-Like, like, oats?"
Finn says: "Like, sentient beings, or oats?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "It doesn't matter!"
Finn says: "I can handle it!"
They arrive at a house that has music playing and a person singing.
Marceline says: "Sounds like dinner."
Marceline says: "Finn, open the door."
Marceline says: "OPEN IT ALREADY!"
Finn says: "No way, Marceline!"
Finn says: "I'm not gonna open this door if innocent people will be hurt!"
Marceline says: "Aren't you bound by your word to do as I say, hero?"
Finn says: "I..."
Inside, the man is still playing. The door is opened and the draft blows the candles out.
Eberhardt says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Sorry about this."
Eberhardt says: "Haah!"
Marceline says: "Hold him down!"
Marceline says: "Are you enjoying this, Finn?"
Finn says: "No!"
Marceline laughs.
Jake says: "I'm not running away, Finn!"
Jake says: "This is just part of my plan!!"
Eberhardt says: "Please, human boy!"
Eberhardt says: "Let me go!"
Finn says: "I'm sorry, sir."
Finn says: "I'm bound by my code of honor to do what she says."
Eberhardt says: "I understand, son."
Eberhardt says: "I was married myself once."
Finn says: "Wait, wait!"
Finn says: "I'm not married to—"
Marceline says: "Ugh!"
Marceline says: "Enough talking!"
Marceline says: "Dinner is served!"
Finn says: "No!"
Marceline says: "How dare you, henchman?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Marceline says: "I order you to let me feed!"
Marceline blasts Finn's arms with a red beam, making them curl up and become immobile. She laughs, hisses and bites Eberhardt. Eberhardt screams.
Finn says: "NOOOOO!!!"
Marceline is revealed to have only been sucking Eberhardt's crimson bow tie.
Marceline says: "Mmm."
Marceline says: "That red bow tie was delicious!"
Marceline says: "What's wrong, Finn?"
Finn says: "I..."
Finn says: "I thought you were—"
Eberhardt says: "Oh, my!"
Eberhardt says: "A white tie!"
Eberhardt says: "Thank you so much!"
Eberhardt says: "This is so beautiful!"
Finn says: "B-but..."
Marceline says: "What?"
Marceline says: "You know I eat the color red sometimes."
Finn says: "Oh..."
Finn says: "Yeah..."
Finn says: "Okay..."
Scene transition; they are flying through the air again.
Marceline says: "We've got plenty more evil to do!"
Finn says: "Man..."
Finn says: "What's wrong with this girl?"
Finn says: "I can't tell if she's messin' with me, or..."
Finn says: "or what."
Marceline says: "Hey, Finn."
Marceline says: "You thinkin' about how that guy's bow tie sorta looked like a bra?"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "No!"
The two arrive at a graveyard.
Marceline says: "I know this place seems a little dead, but don't worry."
Marceline says: "It'll soon be undead."
Marceline says: "Hahaha!"
Marceline says: "Are you ready to lead an evil army of the undead?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Finn says: "Uhh, NEVER!"
Finn says: "Okay!"
Finn says: "I'll do it!"
Marceline laughs. Jake appears in the bushes.
Marceline says: "Huh?"
Marceline says: "What's that noise?"
Marceline turns around. As she does, Jake shrinks down and retreats.
Jake says: "Sorry, Finn."
The scene shifts to the Duchy of Nuts where Finn and Marceline are walking towards the Duke of Nuts' castle with an undead army following behind them.
Marceline says: "Excited to hear the wild screams of an entire castle?"
Marceline says: "Hahaha!"
Finn knocks on the door. Lisby answers.
Lisby says: "Yeeees?"
Lisby says: "Duke and Duchess of Nuts' residence!"
Finn says: "My boss is gonna sack your castle!"
Lisby says: "Oh!"
Lisby says: "Well, that's certainly bad news for us!"
Duke of Nuts says: "Lisby!"
Duke of Nuts says: "Who's at the door?"
Lisby says: "Someone who wishes to sack the nut castle!"
Duke of Nuts says: "Why would you want to sack my nut castle on my second son's first birthday?!"
Duke of Nuts says: "!"
Duke of Nuts says: "SEIZE HIM!"
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "Listen!"
Finn says: "You hear that?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "My master is marching here with her army of the undead!"
Duke of Nuts says: "Oh!"
Duke of Nuts says: "How wonderful!"
Finn says: "Listen to me!!"
Finn says: "EVERYBODY!!"
Finn says: "RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!"
Marceline says: "Hahaha!"
Finn says: "Don't do this, Marceline!"
Finn says: "I beg you!"
Marceline says: "Don't do what?"
Duke of Nuts says: "You're late, Marceline!"
Duke of Nuts says: "My son has been dying to hear your undead music!"
Finn says: "Wha?!"
Finn says: "!"
Lisby says: "Oh, I forgot!"
Lisby says: "Marceline is playing tonight!"
Marceline plays her bass. Everyone starts partying.
Finn says: "Okay..."
Finn says: "So, she makes things seem bad, a-and then..."
Finn says: "or-or her personality makes them seem bad, or..."
Finn says: "I'm over-reacting."
Lisby says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Lisby says: "Why are you thinking so hard?!"
Lisby says: "!"
Lisby says: "Just party hard!"
Lisby says: "Whoo!"
Finn says: "Alright!"
Finn says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Finn says: "Hahahaha!"
Marceline says: "Hey, castle-crasher!"
Finn says: "Hey, Marceline!"
Marceline says: "You like cute things, right?"
Finn says: "Uh, yeah, sure."
Finn says: "Why?"
Marceline says: "Then you might love this."
Marceline says: "The cutest dimple plant ever!"
Finn says: "Whoa-ho-ho!"
Finn says: "That's cool!"
Marceline says: "Here, eat some of its fruit."
Marceline says: "See what happens."
Finn says: "Hahaha!"
Finn says: "A dimple!"
Marceline says: "Okay, henchman, now..."
Marceline says: "I need you to do something."
Finn says: "What is it?"
Marceline says: "I want you to take this dimple plant outside, and kill it!"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Marceline says: "Use my ax bass."
Scene shifts to outside where Finn is holding the guitar and standing in front of the plant.
Finn says: "I'm gonna murder you."
Finn says: "I'm not entirely sure why."
Finn says: "I'm sure this will end happy..."
Finn says: "AAH!"
Finn says: "I don't get it!"
Finn says: "There's always a twist to the stuff Marceline makes me do, but where's the twist in bumping off this bush?!"
Finn says: "!"
Marceline says: "There is no twist."
Marceline says: "Kill it now!"
Finn says: "But wh—"
The plant turns into a monster.
Marceline says: "You should've hacked it to pieces when it was still adorable..."
Finn says: "I-I thought—"
Finn says: "Sick!!"
The monster grabs Finn and eats him.
Marceline says: "Oh, boy..."
Marceline says: "Not bad..."
Marceline says: "for a henchman."
Finn says: "Hmm..."
The scene shifts to the next morning. Finn and Marceline are in a strawberry patch.
Finn says: "Hey."
Finn says: "Can't the sun, like, destroy you?"
Marceline says: "Yeah, it hurts, but I kinda like it."
Marceline says: "Reminds me of when I'd scrape my knees up as a kid, and my mom would patch me up..."
Marceline says: "you know what I'm sayin'?"
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "Jake told me I came out of a cabbage."
They both laugh.
Marceline says: "Hey, Finn, I need you to strangle some pixies."
Finn says: "Yeah, sure."
Finn says: "That sounds good."
Marceline says: "Whoa, why are you being so casual about that?"
Marceline says: "Strangling pixies is some hardcore evil."
Finn says: "I'm not fallin' for your junk anymore, lady!"
Finn says: "You just like sayin' poop that jacks with my brain!"
Marceline says: "Dang, man, I didn't think you'd ever catch on!"
Finn says: "I knew it!"
Finn says: "Hey..."
Finn says: "what about your old henchman?"
Finn says: "Who was that guy?"
Marceline says: "Oh, just an old diving buddy."
Marceline says: "So, you ready to go strangle some pixies?"
Finn says: "Yeah, man!"
Finn says: "I mean, wo-man."
Finn says: "Jake?"
Finn says: "Marceline!"
Jake says: "I'm stakin' that vampire and settin' you free, no matter how terrified I am!"
Finn says: "She's alright, man!"
Jake says: "She's still controlling your mind with evil!"
Jake says: "Now, back off and let me vanquish her from existence!"
Finn says: "I can't let you do that, Jake!"
Finn says: "Jake, listen!"
Finn says: "Marceline is not how she seems!"
Finn says: "She's a radical dame who likes to play games!"
Jake says: "What are you even talkin' about, dude?!"
Jake says: "!"
Marceline crawls under the umbrella.
Finn says: "Oh, man!"
As Finn runs towards the umbrella, Jake smacks him away.
Jake says: "MARCELINE!"
Jake says: "Where is she?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "I-I'm free!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "You faced your fear and saved me!"
Jake says: "I did?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "I did!"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Finn holds up the umbrella. Marceline as a bat comes out of Finn's pack.
Marceline says: "Is it cool?"
Finn says: "Yup!"
Marceline says: "Finn, I owe you big-time!"
Marceline says: "Changing into a bat and hiding in your pack was genius!"
Finn says: "That's what henchmen are for."
Marceline says: "Oh, uh, that reminds me."
Marceline says: "You're fired from your henchman-ship."
Marceline says: "It's no fun when I can't trick you."
Finn says: "We're still on for pixie-strangling tomorrow, though, right?"
Marceline says: "Definitely."
The episode ends.
