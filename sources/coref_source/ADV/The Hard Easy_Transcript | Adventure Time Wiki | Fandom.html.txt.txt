The episode opens in a swamp in heavy rain. Finn and Jake are sitting on the bank with their feet in the water. Finn doesn't have his hat or shirt on. And, his bare upper body and sort of long blond hair is revealed. A mudscamp is watching them close by.
Finn says: "You getting all bit up by mosquitoes?"
Jake says: "I don't know..."
Jake says: "I'm getting bit up by something."
Finn says: "Man, I can't believe you said this was a good swimming hole."
Jake says: "I said it might be good."
Jake says: "It's not, though."
Finn says: "True."
Jake says: "Wanna just go?"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "This place smells like green beans."
Finn puts his blue shirt and green backpack back on and starts leaving with Jake.
Mudscamp says: "My name's Woobeewoo."
Jake says: "Oh, whoa!"
Woobeewoo says: "I need your help."
Woobeewoo says: "My people are in trouble."
Woobeewoo says: "I'm a mudscamp."
Finn says: "Yeah, Woobeewoo!"
Finn says: "Of course we'll help."
Finn says: "Why didn't you just say something before?"
Woobeewoo says: "I'm shy."
Woobeewoo says: "It took me a while to work up the nerve."
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Right on."
Finn says: "You good now?"
Woobeewoo says: "We'll see."
Woobeewoo says: "Come, I'll take you to my village."
The three walk over to a village of small mud huts. Several mudscamps are seen standing around.
Woobeewoo says: "Here we are: the village of my people."
Woobeewoo says: "It doesn't have an official name, but I call it South Woobeewoo."
Woobeewoo says: "Uh, this way."
They walk over to a mud pedestal on which are two mudscamps supporting another mudscamp wearing a jingle bell on its head.
Woobeewoo says: "This is the village elder."
Woobeewoo says: "He'll fill you in on the "deets."
Woobeewoo Elder says: "Greetings, heroes."
Jake says: "Bleehhh!"
Jake says: "Aw!"
Jake says: "Ehhh!"
Woobeewoo Elder says: "I'm so sorry about that."
Woobeewoo Elder says: "You know, we--we secrete stink oil all day out our awful-sauce glands."
Woobeewoo Elder says: "You know, I guess I should have warned you."
Woobeewoo Elder says: "Anyway, lemme cut the cheese."
Woobeewoo on right says: "Cut to the chase."
Woobeewoo Elder says: "Yes..."
Woobeewoo Elder says: "I mean--I mean, of course "cut to the chase," I mean, for many--for many moons now our village has been under siege by the Mega Frog."
Woobeewoo Elder says: "He's 100 stories of 110% 10-speed terror, like, bam, like, fresh out the grease."
Woobeewoo Elder says: "I mean, he chases us all up and down from first base to home, trying to eat us alive."
Woobeewoo Elder says: "We--we've always managed to escape, but it's c-razy scary, I mean, w-what if you got ate?"
Woobeewoo Elder says: "Think about it."
Woobeewoo Elder says: "see, th-they're already practicing, the poor fools."
Woobeewoo Elder says: "They don't know what they're in for."
Jake says: "Whoa, relax, buddy!"
Jake says: "You're talkin' to the right couple of guys."
Finn says: "Yeah, man!"
Finn says: "Me and Jake will bust this Mega Frog up, right up his bumble-stop."
Woobeewoo Elder says: "That is excellent news."
Woobeewoo Elder says: "I mean, h-here, take this, please."
Woobeewoo Elder says: "it's--it's a bag of lollies."
Jake says: "That's nice!"
Jake says: "Thanks, man."
Woobeewoo Elder says: "Now farewell, heroes!"
Woobeewoo Elder says: "We're counting on you..."
Woobeewoo Elder says: "for reals!"
Finn and Jake walk off. Jake is now carrying the bag. Jake sniffs the air.
Jake says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "Gettin' anything?"
Jake says: "Yeah, but it's hard to make out."
Jake says: "Could just be some footprints..."
Jake says: "or an old doodie."
Finn says: "Word..."
Finn says: "Hey, I have an idea."
Finn says: "We can use those lollipops to leave a trail."
Finn says: "That way we won't get lost out here."
Jake says: "Yeah, that's a great idea, man."
Jake says: "I was just gonna throw 'em all on the ground anyway."
Jake says: "The thing with frogs is they got a real subtle smell."
Jake says: "Kinda like when you open up a new thing of, um..."
Jake says: "CDRs."
Finn says: "Like..."
Finn says: "electric celery?"
Jake says: "Yeah..."
Jake says: "but subtler."
Jake says: "Mm-HMM!"
Jake says: "Just as I suspected."
Finn says: "Sweet."
Finn says: "These'll take us right to him."
The two follow the footprints and pass a tree with a butt-shaped gnarl, running and laughing. They keep following them and are led back to the same tree.
Finn says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "Huh."
Finn says: "We've passed this butt tree, like, three times."
Jake says: "Oh, yeah."
Finn says: "We should probably backtrack--get reoriented and all that."
Jake says: "Word."
Jake says: "Wait, these prints are all messed up!"
Finn says: "Whoa."
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Guess we better follow the lollipops back."
Finn says: "Where's those at?"
Jake says: "We ran out of those a while ago."
Finn says: "Snaaaap."
Finn says: "Totally lost."
Finn says: "Dang!"
Finn says: "Do you think maybe the Mega Frog made all those footprints on purpose?"
Finn says: "So we'd use up all our lollies and get totally lost?"
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "Nah, man!"
Jake says: "Frogs are mighty dumb, you know that."
Jake says: "He's probably runnin' around like that 'cause he's lost!"
Jake says: "AAAAAAAAH!"
Jake says: "Man, forget that!"
Jake says: "I can't see anything through that mist."
Jake says: "Plus, I got struck by lightning."
Jake says: "We're just gonna have to set up camp and wait out the storm."
Finn says: "Cool!"
Finn says: "I call fire patrol!"
Jake says: "Yeah, me, too!"
Scene switches to Finn and Jake dropping some logs and twigs on the ground.
Jake says: "Do you remember how to make a fire with sticks?"
Finn says: "Yeah, man--it's easy."
Finn says: "Uhhh, rub 'em together, right?"
Jake says: "Oh, yeah."
Finn and Jake pick up twigs and rub them together in various ways.
Jake says: "I don't think it's workin', man."
Finn says: "I think I saw some guy do it like this once."
Jake says: "That's not it."
Jake says: "I think you're on to something, though."
Finn says: "Yeah, here we go!"
Finn says: "Friction!"
Jake says: "Come on, boys, come on!"
Finn says: "I don't know."
Jake says: "Oh, hey, you got the fire goin'."
Jake says: "Right on!"
Finn says: "Jake, how did you--?"
Finn says: "What the--?"
Finn says: "It's the Mega Frog!"
Finn says: "Quick, put the fire out!"
Fire is extinguished. Finn and Jake walk into some tall grass and peer over it.
Finn says: "Jake, look!"
Finn says: "He's just sittin' there!"
Finn says: "What's he doin' out there?"
Jake says: "I don't know, but let's pound him while he's vulnerable."
Finn says: "Okay, Sweetles."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Hoi-YAAAH!"
Finn and Jake start punching the frog. A log falls off of it and lands near Jake, who passes out. Another falls off and nearly hits Finn. Finn realizes that the "frog" is just a wooden structure.
Finn says: "Wha--?"
Finn says: "Jake, wake up."
Finn says: "Look!"
Jake says: "Ow, my head hurts."
Finn says: "Look at that thing!"
Jake says: "Oh, what?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "."
Jake says: "Hey, whoa!"
Jake says: "That gives me a great idea."
Jake says: "We can make a Finn and Jake out of sticks and stuff and lure the Mega Frog out here, then ba-donk him right while he's all confused!"
Finn says: "Yeaaaah!"
Finn says: "That's a great idea, man!"
Finn says: "That's a great idea, Jake."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "What is it, Jake?"
Jake says: "FUH-FUH-FUH-FROOOOOOG!!"
Finn says: "Wha--?"
Finn says: "Come on, Jake!"
Jake stretches his arms and the two are propelled upward away from the frog. They land on their backs near a cave.
Finn says: "Jake, let's hide in this cave."
Finn says: "Shmow-tow, dude!"
Finn says: "That guy's gonna dingle our bones into tapioca pudding!"
Jake says: "Finn, that is gross, man!"
Jake says: "Don't use language like that."
Frog's footsteps thud outside. It sticks its head into the opening of the cave and squeezes the rest of its body through it and starts roaring. Jake grows big, runs up to it, and hits it.
Jake says: "Chomp that!"
The frog is thrown against the wall of the cave, unaffected. Finn jumps toward it but collides with the frog's fist and falls to the ground. The frog grabs Jake and roars into his face. Jake pushes him away but the frog grabs Jake's face and pulls it toward him. The frog opens his mouth and chomps down on Jake's head.
Jake says: "Aaaah!"
Jake says: "He's eating me!"
Jake says: "Aah!"
Jake says: "Gently eating me!"
Jake says: "No teeth!"
Jake says: "Mostly tongue!"
Woobeewoo says: "I need your help."
Woobeewoo says: "My people are in trouble..."
Woobeewoo says: "I'm shy..."
Woobeewoo says: "I mean, he chases us all up and down from first base to home."
Woobeewoo says: "We've always managed to escape--."
Finn says: "You gettin' anything?"
Jake says: "Yeah, but it's hard to make out."
Woobeewoo says: "I'm shy..."
Woobeewoo says: "first base..."
Jake says: "Yeah, but it's hard to make out."
Woobeewoo says: "I'm shy."
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "it's hard to make out."
Finn says: "Hmmm."
Finn says: "That's it!"
Finn says: "Jake, wait!"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Frog levitates, light shines through its eyes, mouth, and spots on its skin. The skin falls away, revealing a skeleton on which grow muscles, skin. A face and clothes appear on the figure, revealing Prince Huge.
Prince Huge says: "Ah, this is rad!"
Prince Huge says: "I'm hot again!"
Prince Huge says: "Thanks, little dudes!"
Prince Huge says: "I really appreciate it!"
Prince Huge says: "I don't get it, though..."
Prince Huge says: "I kissed just about everything I could get my lips on."
Prince Huge says: "How come it only worked with you?"
Finn says: "You can't break your own curse by kissin' somebody."
Finn says: "Somebody's gotta kiss you."
Prince Huge says: "Oh."
Prince Huge says: "Weird."
Prince Huge says: "Well, thanks, man."
Prince Huge says: "I don't know a lot of dudes who'd do that to help a guy out."
Finn says: "Whatevs."
