The episode begins with Finn walking through some bushes, looking for Jake.
Finn says: "I don't know how to play."
Jake says: "Exactly!"
Distant screams are heard off screen.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Let's go!"
Jake says: "Oh, wait up."
Jake says: "I gotta finish tuning my viola."
Scene changes to Finn running toward the Soft Village. He enters it and sees several Soft People crying.
Finn says: "Soft People!"
Finn says: "Why are you all in a tizzy?"
Soft Person #1 says: "The Gut Grinder!"
Soft Person #1 says: "He's back!"
Finn says: "The "Gut Grinder?"
Old Soft Person says: "Yes, the Gut Grinder is a gold-eating monster."
Old Soft Person says: "In the past, the Soft People of this village enjoyed piling our gold in the center of town and dancing wildly around it."
Old Soft Person says: "It was awesome!"
Old Soft Person says: "But then, the Gut Grinder came and stole our pile of gold."
Old Soft Person says: "So we adapted and learned how to hide our gold using a big cup."
Old Soft Person says: "And it worked!"
Old Soft Person says: "The Gut Grinder didn't come back!"
Old Soft Person says: "But recently, and admittedly it was probably a bad idea, we took our gold out from under the cup and we put it in the center of town."
Old Soft Person says: "Haha, 'cause--'cause we really like dancing around it!"
Old Soft Person says: "But, boy oh boy, was that a mistake."
Old Soft Person says: "You know what happened?"
Finn says: "Uhhh..."
Finn says: "it came back and ate all your gold?"
Old Soft Person says: "Yes, oh, yes!"
Finn says: "Aw, don't cry, Soft Old Man."
Finn says: "I'll find this monster and bring peace to this village."
Finn says: "I swear!"
Soft Person #1 says: "Swear to what?"
Finn says: "I swear to justice!"
Soft People says: "Whoa!"
Soft People says: "He swears to justice!"
Finn says: "Okay, so, what does he look like?"
Old Soft Person says: "Ohh, it's so scary we usually close our eyes and go wee-wee when he attacks."
Old Soft Person says: "But..."
Old Soft Person says: "Wha--?"
Jake says: "Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!"
Soft Person #1 says: "Look!"
Soft Person #1 says: "His paw matches the footprint!"
Soft People start murmuring, terrified.
Soft Person #1 says: "I'm so scared, I'm gonna go wee-wee!"
Finn says: "Whoa, no, no-no-no-no!"
Finn says: "Calm down, everybody."
Finn says: "This is my friend, Jake the Dog."
Soft Person #2 says: "Thank goodness."
Soft Person #1 says: "Yeah--I almost wee-wee'd!"
Jake says: "Wait, you were gonna wee-wee if I was the Gut Grinder?"
Soft Person #1 says: "Oh, yeah!"
Soft Person #1 says: "We're terrified of him."
Jake says: "Then I am the Gut Grinder!"
Soft Person #1 says: "I'm gonna wee-wee!"
Finn says: "That guy wee-wees weird."
Jake says: "I'm just kiddin', everybody."
Jake says: "I'm not the Gut Grinder."
Jake says: "I'm..."
Jake says: "Jake the Dog!"
Jake says: "Woohoo!"
Soft Person #3 says: "Aw, he's just a cute little dog!"
Jake says: "Hey, I'm not cute!"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Oh, heheh."
Finn says: "Pfft."
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "I didn't say anything."
Finn says: "People of the village of Soft People, I, Finn, and my buddy Jake, will find this monstrous monster and slay it!"
Soft People cheer.
Finn says: "Come on, let's go, Jake."
Jake says: "Noooo..."
Soft Child says: "Bye-bye, doggy!"
Jake says: "Bye, Soft Village."
Scene changes to Finn and Jake following the footprints. Jake is walking in them.
Jake says: "Hey Finn, my feet fit these prints pretty well."
Jake says: "Hm, what if I really am the Gut Grinder?"
Finn says: "Dude, your paws'll fit anything."
Jake says: "I'm Finn the Human and I stink at viola!"
Finn says: "I'm Jake the Dog and I put my nose in poop."
Jake says: "There's a lot of interesting smells in poop."
Commotion is heard in the distance.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Scene switches to Finn inside Cube Village.
Finn says: "Hey Cube People, what's going on here?"
Cube Person #1 says: "The Gut Grinder stormed into our village and ate all of our gold!"
Jake says: "Wait, what happened?"
Cube People says: "Aaah!"
Cube People says: "The Gut Grinder!"
Finn says: "Whoa, no, no, no!"
Finn says: "He's not the Gut Grinder!"
Finn says: "He's my friend!"
Cube Person #2 says: "We saw the Gut Grinder and he looks exactly like him!"
Jake says: "Th-that's ridiculous."
Finn says: "Jake, back to your normal size."
Jake says: "Oh yeah."
Jake says: "I am not..."
Jake says: "the Gut Grinder."
Jake says: "Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh."
Cube Person #1 says: "Aw, he's just a cute little dog."
Jake says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "Y'all are the ones who are cute."
Jake says: "I'm hot."
Cube Person #1 says: "Aw, look--he's all mad!"
Cube Person #2 says: "Even cuter."
Jake says: "Aaah!"
Cube Person #1 says: "Aw, so cute, so cute!"
Jake says: "I'm not cute!"
Jake says: "I'm--mnh,  ooh."
Finn says: "We are also seeking the Gut Grinder."
Finn says: "Me and my friend Jake will find it and slay it!"
Finn says: "Tell us what he looked like."
Cube Person #2 says: "Exactly like him,  but bigger."
Finn says: "Huh..."
Finn says: "Which way did he go?"
Cube People point left.
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Hey, come on!"
Jake says: "Wha--?"
Jake says: "Where am I?"
Finn says: "Thanks, guys!"
Jake says: "I'm not cute."
Jake says: "I'll mess you up."
Scene changes to Finn riding Jake through a field.
Jake says: "Finn..."
Jake says: "?"
Jake says: "What if I am the Gut Grinder?"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "What if I'm, like, stealing gold in my sleep?"
Finn says: "You can't be stealing gold in your sleep--I watch you while you sleep."
Jake says: "Wha--?"
Jake says: "Yo, Finn, that is creepy, man."
Finn says: "I can't help it."
Finn says: "I take pictures."
Jake says: "Well, when do you sleep?"
Finn says: "Justice never sleeps."
Jake says: "Well, there's gotta be a time when you're not watchin' me..."
Jake says: "that--that I--that I might be stealin' gold unconsciously!"
Finn says: "You..."
Finn says: "are..."
Finn says: "not..."
Finn says: "the..."
Finn says: "Gut..."
Finn says: "Grinder!"
An alarm starts sounding. Finn and Jake see that it is coming from the Spiky Village.
Alarm says: "City in danger!"
Alarm says: "City in danger!"
Finn says: "Let's go!"
Finn says: "Oh, wait--what if these guys think you're the Gut Grinder?"
Finn says: "Hmm..."
Jake says: "I love it!"
Finn says: "Woohoo!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
They enter Spiky Village. Several Spiky People are seen crying.
Finn says: "Oh, man!"
Finn says: "These people are a mess!"
Spiky Guard says: "Halt!"
Spiky Guard says: "Identify yourselves immediately!"
Finn says: "I am Finn the hero!"
Jake says: "I'm Groucho!"
Finn says: "We're on a mission to catch the Gut Grinder."
Spiky Mayor says: "I am the mayor of this village."
Spiky Mayor says: "Our gold has just been stolen by the very monster you speak of."
Finn says: "I hereby vow to catch that thief and bring your gold back!"
Spiky Mayor says: "Our people thank you."
Spiky Mayor says: "I present to you this photo  of the Gut Grinder to help in your mission."
Finn says: "Oh, thanks."
Jake says: "Finn, it's me!"
Finn says: "We already knew that."
Finn says: "It's just one of those weird coincidences--like how my belly button looks like your face."
Jake says: "Yeah, I-I know you think it does, Finn--but this is different."
Jake says: "I'm scared, Finn."
Finn says: "Jake, stop it!"
Jake accidentally shakes off the Groucho glasses.
Spiky Mayor says: "Wha--?"
Spiky Mayor says: "Oh, it's the Gut Grinder!"
Spiky People start murmuring angrily and surround Finn and Jake.
Finn says: "No, no-no-no-no!"
Finn says: "He's not the Gut Grinder!"
Finn says: "I swear on my good name..."
Finn says: "and justice..."
Finn says: "and Jake's cute face!"
Jake bats his eyelids.
Spiky Mayor says: "His face is weird."
Spiky Mayor says: "The truth is obvious: your friend is the Gut Grinder!"
Spiky People take Jake.
Finn says: "NOOOOOO!"
Spiky Mayor says: "You are under arrest for stealing our gold."
Finn says: "I'll get you out of here..."
Finn says: "somehow."
Jake says: "No, Finn..."
Jake says: "I belong behind bars."
Jake says: "Look at the evidence--I really am the Gut Grinder."
Finn says: "Buddy, listen to me."
Finn says: "You've been my best friend for as long as I can remember!"
Finn says: "That's enough evidence to prove to me that you're not a monster!"
Jake says: "Then..."
Jake says: "why am I in jail?"
Jake says: "Only Gut Grinders go to jail."
Old Man Prisoner says: "I'm in jail and I'm not the Gut Grinder."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Wait, I got an idea!"
Finn reaches through the bars and pulls out the old man's tooth and runs to the middle of town, holding up the tooth.
Finn says: "Hey, Gut Grinder!"
Finn says: "I got some gold here that you missed."
Finn says: "Come and get it!"
A manhole cover rattles nearby. Out pops a cute dog face.
Finn says: "Huh."
Finn says: "Whoa, you're the Gut Grinder?"
The face shoots out sharp points and rises up. It turns out to be a mace held by the Gut Grinder, who climbs out of the manhole. The Gut Grinder growls and sees the gold tooth in Finn's hand. He chases Finn, punches him, and steps on him, taking the tooth and laughing. The scene switches to inside the jail.
Old Man Prisoner says: "Oh, Gut Grinder."
Old Man Prisoner says: "Oh, Gut Grinder..."
Old Man Prisoner says: "you're a little cutesy."
Old Man Prisoner says: "You're a little cutesy-wootsy."
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Grrrr..."
Jake says: "not cute."
Jake says: "And I want GOLD!"
Jake grows huge, breaks out of jail, runs over to the Gut Grinder and kicks him, sending the gold tooth into the air.
Finn says: "Woohoo!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "We got him!"
Finn says: "Thanks for saving me, Jake!"
Jake says: "Grrrr!"
Jake says: "I'm not Jake--I'm the Gut Grinder!"
Jake says: "Now give me that gold tooth!"
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Jake?"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn runs away and accidentally rips his pack on a spike, spilling its contents. Jake corners him.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Rawr!"
Jake says: "Now give me that tooth!"
Finn says: "If I give you this stupid tooth, will you stop being a crazy jerk?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "What the--?"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "You never turn into a monster when I want you to."
Finn says: "It's always, "Not now, Finn."
Finn says: "I have a headache."
Jake says: "Ah, stay away from my viola!"
Finn says: "Jake, you remember your viola!"
Jake says: "Wha--huh?"
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "Where am I?"
Jake says: "Finn, is that you?"
Finn says: "Who else would it be, baby?"
Jake says: "Whoo!"
Jake says: "I guess I went nuts."
Finn says: "You were so crazy, man!"
Finn says: "Like--like, actually crazy."
Finn says: "It's good to have you back."
Jake says: "It's good to have you pat my back."
Finn says: "Man, if I had known you were so easily manipulated, I would have eaten more of your ice cream."
Jake says: "Cut it out!"
Scene changes to Gut Grinder. Spiky People surround it.
Spiky Person says: "Cut open the Gut Grinder's belly!"
Something starts moving inside the Gut Grinder. It rips open and gold spills out.
Spiky Mayor says: "What the--?"
Spiky Mayor says: "What the--?"
Spiky Mayor says: "Sharon, what are you doing in the Gut Grinder?"
Spiky People says: "That's the mayor's wife!"
Spiky Mayor says: "And the Gut Grinder's skin is not skin at all--it's cloth!"
Spiky Mayor says: "Sharon!"
Spiky Mayor says: "Have you been sewing?!"
Spiky Mayor says: "!"
Sharon says: "Yes, Cameron."
Sharon says: "I've been stealing gold."
Spiky Mayor says: "WHY, SHARON?!"
Spiky Mayor says: "!"
Sharon says: "Because I like to buy things, Cameron!"
Sharon says: "I like to shop!"
Sharon says: "And I dressed up like Jake because I think he's hot."
Spiky People gasp. Jake raises his eyebrows up and down.
Spiky Mayor says: "You have been a naughty girl, Sharon."
Spiky Mayor says: "Finn and Jake, thank you for saving my Spiky Village."
Finn says: "No problem, mayor."
Spiky Mayor says: "Now give us a hug."
Spiky People laugh and advance toward Finn and Jake.
Finn says: "No, don't do that!"
Finn says: "Don't hug us!"
Finn says: "Don't touch me!"
Finn says: "AAAAAAAAAH!"
Jake says: "Ow!"
Jake says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "Don't touch us!"
Jake says: "OWWWW!"
The episode ends.
