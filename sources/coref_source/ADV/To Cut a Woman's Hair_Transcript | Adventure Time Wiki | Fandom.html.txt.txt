The episode starts off in a forest with Finn feeding baby birds in a nest by chewing an apple first; the birds are chirping.
Finn says: "Blah-la-luh."
Finn says: "Hey, Jake, give me some of that apple."
Jake says: "Coming up."
Jake says: "I know what you're thinking about."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Kissin' Princess Bubblegum on the mouth!"
Finn spits the chewed-up apple to the baby birds.
Finn says: "No, I'm not!"
Finn says: "And..."
Finn says: "I wouldn't even do that ever."
Jake says: "Yeah, you would."
Jake says: "You're just bad at talking to ladies."
Finn says: "Hmmph."
Finn says: "Ehggg-uh-ya-uh."
Finn says: "Uh, should I keep going, Mrs."
Finn says: "Yoder?"
Mrs. Yoder says: "No, Finn, that's plenty."
Mrs. Yoder says: "Thank you."
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "Let us know if you need anything else."
Finn says: "Hyah!"
Mrs. Yoder says: "You two are heroes!"
Finn jumps off the tree and spins around a branch to land swiftly on the ground.
Finn says: "Hunh."
Jake says: "Come on, dude."
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Do you hear that?"
Finn says: "She called us heroes!"
Jake says: "Yeah, I heard."
A bush starts rustling; Finn and Jake both spot the moving bush and look shocked.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Huh?"
The Tree Witch pops out of the bush.
Tree Witch says: "Hey!"
Tree Witch says: "How's it going?!"
Tree Witch says: "!"
Tree Witch says: "Ugh!"
Tree Witch says: "Is that true, what the bird said?"
Tree Witch says: "You guys are heroes?"
Finn says: "Why were you hiding in that shrub?"
Tree Witch says: "Oh, I wasn't hiding."
Tree Witch says: "I'm a Tree Witch."
Tree Witch says: "I can turn into trees and shrubs and bushes and stuff."
Tree Witch says: "Check it out."
She holds out her arms and they grow into mini trees. She then turns them back to normal.
Jake says: "Bleh."
Tree Witch says: "So listen, I need you two heroes to get me a lock of princess hair."
Finn says: "Why do you need princess hair?"
Tree Witch says: "Why?"
Tree Witch says: "'Cause I have a balding problem!"
Tree Witch says: "What, are you, blind?"
Tree Witch says: "Are You blind!"
Tree Witch says: "?"
Finn says: "No, we're not blind."
Jake says: "No, we're not blind."
Finn says: "I had no idea..."
Jake says: "I had no idea..."
Finn says: "I don't know..."
Jake says: "I don't know..."
Tree Witch says: "Anyway, I need the princess hair so I can put it on my head."
Tree Witch says: "And then I'll be beautiful."
Finn says: "Oh, well, uh, we know lots of princesses."
Jake stops him from talking and laughs nervously.
Jake says: "Uh, can you, um, give us a minute?"
Tree Witch says: "Yeah, okay."
Jake says: "Dude, I don't think we should help her."
Finn says: "Why not?"
Jake says: "'Cause she's a witch!"
Finn says: "Maybe she's a good witch."
Jake says: "Her?"
Jake says: "Are you kidding?"
Jake says: "Come on, look at her!"
Jake says: "If she was good, she wouldn't be so ugly."
Tree Witch says: "Are you guys still talking?!"
Tree Witch says: "!"
Finn says: "So what do we do?"
Finn says: "Tell her we can't help her 'cause she's ugly?"
Jake says: "No, man!"
Jake says: "She'll kill us or put a freaky curse on us or something."
Jake says: "Ahh."
Jake says: "You don't mind if I take a load off, do you?"
Tree Witch says: "What were you guys talking about?"
Jake says: "How pretty you are."
Tree Witch says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "We were just saying someone as pretty as you doesn't even need a full head of hair."
Jake says: "Isn't that right, buddy?"
Finn says: "Uh, yeah, totally!"
Tree Witch says: "Nuh-unh!"
Jake says: "Girl, if I didn't already have a G."
Jake says: "F."
Jake says: ", I'd be on you like butter on toast!"
Tree Witch lies down on ground next to Jake.
Tree Witch says: "I don't mind if you have a G."
Tree Witch says: "F."
Jake says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Dude, I don't think it's working."
Jake says: "Yeah, I think I'm making things worse."
Tree Witch touches Jake's leg.
Jake says: "Ah-ah-ahhh!"
Tree Witch says: "Hey."
Jake says: "What?"
Tree Witch says: "How would you..."
Tree Witch says: "court me?"
Jake says: "Um..."
Jake says: "spaghetti dinner?"
Tree Witch says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "Look, Lady, we can't help you get princess hair."
Tree Witch says: "Why not?"
Finn says: "Because..."
Finn says: "we only help when someone's in danger."
Tree Witch says: "Oh!"
Tree Witch says: "Well, why didn't you say so?"
The Tree Witch stands up and clears her throat. She grunts and uses magical powers to pick up Jake.
Jake says: "Hey..."
Jake says: "uh..."
Jake says: "what'sâ€”"
Jake says: "?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Yaaah!"
Jake says: "Hey!"
She places him on the ground then sits on him.
Tree Witch says: "There."
Tree Witch says: "Now someone's in danger."
Jake says: "I told you she was evil!"
Finn says: "Grrrrrr..."
Finn says: "."
Finn says: "Yaah!"
Finn gets angry and charges at the Tree Witch. He jumps to attack her, but she deflects him with a force field.
Tree Witch says: "What, you forget I'm a witch?"
Finn says: "Maybe."
Tree Witch says: "Well, maybe you should get me some princess hair, so maybe your friend doesn't get sucked into my bottomless bottom!"
Jake starts getting pulled into her bottom.
Jake says: "Nyuh!"
Jake says: "Get some princess hair!!"
Finn says: "All right, fine!"
Tree Witch' says: "Wait!"
Tree Witch' says: "Uh, you..."
Tree Witch' says: "you can't tell anyone why you need it."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Why?"
Tree Witch says: "I don't want anyone to know I have a balding problem."
Finn says: "O..."
Finn says: "kay."
Scene changes to show Finn looking at castle.
Finn says: "It's Princess Muscles's castle!"
Muscle Princess picks up the door from the inside and throws it away.
Muscle Princess says: "Hi, Finn."
Finn says: "Uh, hey, Princess Muscles."
Muscle Princess says: "What brings you by?"
Finn says: "Um, you were the nearest princess, and I need a lock of your hair."
Muscle Princess looks away and blushes.
Muscle Princess says: "I understand."
Finn says: "You do?"
Muscle Princess says: "Mm-hmm."
Finn screams and falls through her arms onto the ground.
Finn says: "Aah!"
Finn says: "What are you doing?"
Muscle Princess says: "Trying to give you a hug."
Finn says: "Why?"
Finn says: "I want hair, not hug!"
Muscle Princess says: "Oh, I see."
Muscle Princess says: "You want to take things slo-o-o-w."
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "I--I'm here to save you!"
Finn says: "From your hair!"
Finn says: "It looks really bad."
Finn says: "Cut it off, quick!"
Muscle Princess says: "Of course it looks bad."
Muscle Princess says: "If I had beautiful, shiny hair, no one would look at my muscles."
Muscle Princess says: "Come back when you wanna get serious about loving me!"
She slams the door back into place. Screen now shows Finn lying on the ground beat up and bruised.
Finn says: "I am terrible at talking to ladies."
Scene changes to Finn wandering around a forest.
Finn says: "Hmm..."
Finn says: "Where's a princess?"
Finn says: "Princess?"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Princess..."
Finn says: "Princess..."
Finn says: "Who's that?"
Finn says: "Does she..."
Finn says: "live in the woods now?"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "G-G-Get away from my camp!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'll cut you!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Hrm."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I'm never gonna go back home."
Finn says: "Huh."
Finn says: "Wait."
Finn says: "Does she even have hair?"
Finn says: "She does!"
Finn says: "Well..."
Finn says: "hair is hair."
He pulls out a pair of scissors. Lumpy Space Princess wakes up in the middle of him clipping her hair.
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, my Glob!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "What the stuff are you doing?!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Why are you cutting my lumps?!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "!"
Finn says: "Because they're, uh..."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I knew you liked me."
Finn says: "No, I don't!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Just admit it, Lover Boy!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You can't resist me!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Well, if you want these lumps, you gotta put a ring on it!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Where's my ring?!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "I knew you liked me, Finn."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "That's why you're running!"
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Get in touch with your feelings, babe!"
Finn is now running through a dark, ominous graveyard.
Finn says: "What am I gonna do?"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "A graveyard?"
Finn says: "Yes!"
Finn says: "There's got to be a hairy princess in there that won't think I'm hitting on her!"
Princess Beautiful says: "Hi, Finn."
Finn says: "Ohh!"
Finn moves her skull around checking to see if she has any hair.
Princess Beautiful says: "What?"
Princess Beautiful says: "What are you -- Please stop."
Finn climbs out of the hole followed by Princess Beautiful.
Finn says: "Where's her hair?!"
Finn says: "!"
Princess Beautiful says: "Thanks, Finn."
Finn pushes away grass from the bottom of the tombstone so he can read the rest of what it says.
Finn says: ""Here lies Princess Beautiful."
Finn says: "She was so beautiful, but died of baldness?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "" Dang it!"
Scene shifts to the Tree Witch and Jake, who is even deeper in her bottom.
Tree Witch says: "I'm gonna look so beautiful..."
Tree Witch says: "Invited to all the parties."
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "I'm sorry, man."
Finn says: "Getting princess hair is -- is impossible!"
Finn says: "They all just think I'm in love with them!"
Finn says: "Ugh!"
Finn says: "I can't do it."
Finn says: "You're gonna have to spend the rest of your life in this witch's butt."
Jake says: "Noooo!"
Tree Witch says: "Eh!"
Tree Witch says: "Quiet down!"
Tree Witch says: "I'm daydreaming!"
Jake says: "Dude, if they think you like them, then use that."
Jake says: "Embrace it!"
Jake says: "Find the least terrible princess you can, play her some music, cook her a meal, smoove talk her until she likes you."
Jake says: "And then get the hair!"
Finn says: "Wait."
Finn says: "You mean like go on a date?"
Jake says: "Marry a princess if you need to!"
Jake says: "Just get her hair!"
Jake says: "Aaaah!"
Jake's head gets sucked into her butt.
Finn says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "Go get the hair!"
Finn says: "Okay!"
Finn says: "Hold on!"
Scene shifts to the Candy Kingdom.
Finn says: "Princess Bubblegum!"
Finn is holding an ax, standing in front of Princess Bubblegum, who is watering her plants.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hi, Finn!"
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "I need you to come with me!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Why?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm watering right now."
Finn smacks the water can out of her hand.
Finn says: "Just come on."
Finn says: "We don't have much time!"
They enter an open spot in the woods with a pot of boiling water in the middle.
Princess Bubblegum says: "What is this, Finn?"
Finn says: "We're gonna have a spaghetti dinner."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Whoa!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Really?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Where do we sit?"
Finn immediately goes off yelling and chops down a tree.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Um, Finn?"
Finn then chops up the tree even more to creates seats for both of them.
Finn says: "Put your butt here!"
Finn says: "Hurry!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh."
Finn pulls a fancy table cloth from his backpack along with silverware, dishes, and a candle and places it all on the stump. He then turns to a ladybug with a violin.
Finn says: "Hey, Simon, make it romantic."
Finn says: "Oww!"
Finn says: "Here, shove this in your mouth!"
Finn says: "It's hot!"
He drops the spaghetti on the table.
Finn says: "Please, Princess!"
Finn says: "Just stick it in your mouth!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Well, okay."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You're lucky I love spaghetti!"
Finn says: "Um, Princess..."
Finn says: "do you like me?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn, of course I like you."
Finn says: "Really?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Yes!"
Finn says: "Now give me some of your hair!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, Finn, that's sweet."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Sure, I'll give you some of my hair."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Here."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Take it, you cutie."
Finn jumps on the table knocking everything off.
Finn says: "Thank you, Princess Bubblegum!!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "My spaghetti!"
Scene shifts back to the Tree Witch sitting on Jake. It is now dawn.
Tree Witch says: "My cat had kittens..."
Tree Witch says: "and I'm thinking of naming one "Little Whiner."
Tree Witch says: "" What do you think?"
Tree Witch says: "Is that a good name?"
Finn appears holding Princess Bubblegum's hair.
Finn says: "Totally did it!"
Finn says: "Genuine princess hair."
Finn says: "You hear that, Jake?"
Jake says: "Just give it to her, already!!"
Finn says: "All right, lady, a deal is a deal."
Finn hands her the hair and she gasps in excitement, but then frowns.
Tree Witch says: "Ahh!"
Tree Witch says: "This isn't hair!"
Tree Witch says: "It's bubblegum!"
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn takes the hair back and licks it.
Finn says: "It is bubblegum!"
Tree Witch says: "Well, I guess you failed."
Tree Witch says: "Say goodbye to your dog."
She clutches her fist and starts pulling what's left of Jake into her bottom.
Jake says: "Aaaah!"
Finn says: "WAAIT!"
Tree Witch says: "What?"
Finn says: "If I learned anything today, it's that I'm awesome at talking to ladies!"
Finn says: "And, lady, you are crazy ugly!"
Tree Witch says: "Wha-a-a-t?"
Jake says: "Duuuude!"
Finn says: "Having beautiful hair isn't gonna get you anywhere, because you're ugly, inside and out, so ugly I want to throw up."
Jake says: "Duuuude!"
Finn says: "No one will ever find you beautiful."
Finn says: "everrr!"
Finn says: "And it's got nothing to do with the ol' chrome dome."
Finn says: "It has to do with what's in here."
Finn says: "Can you get off my friend now?"
Jake says: "Du-hu-huuude..."
Tree Witch says: "He's right."
Jake says: "Huh?"
Tree Witch says: "Well, don't get me wrong."
Tree Witch says: "I know I'm ugly."
Tree Witch says: "And evil."
Tree Witch says: "But I thought if I had some beautiful hair, I could learn how to love myself."
Tree Witch starts to sob.
Finn says: "Gee..."
Finn says: "I feel kind of bad."
Jake says: "I don't."
Finn says: "Hey, witch!"
Finn says: "Does it have to be princess hair?"
Tree Witch says: "No."
Tree Witch says: "Just beautiful hair."
Finn says: "Well then, check this out!"
Finn says: "HA HA-A-A-A-A-A!!!"
Tree Witch and Jake both gasp in awe.
Tree Witch says: "You'd really give me your hair?"
Finn says: "Sure!"
A second passes on screen and Finn appears with no hair at all. The Tree Witch is now wearing his hair like a wig.
Tree Witch says: "So..."
Tree Witch says: "how do I look?"
Finn says: "Totally beautiful."
Finn says: "inside and out!"
Tree Witch says: "Thank you, Finn."
Tree Witch says: "And now to use my hair for evil."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Tree Witch says: "'Cause I'm evil!!"
Tree Witch says: "Ohh -- Oh, no."
Tree Witch says: "I think I fractured a branch."
The episode ends with Finn and Jake laughing at the Tree Witch.
