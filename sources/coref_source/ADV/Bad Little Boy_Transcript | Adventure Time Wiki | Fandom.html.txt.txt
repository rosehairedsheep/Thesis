Scene shows Doctor Prince running away, holding the Enchiridion while being chased by Fionna and Cake who are riding a giant Gunter.
Doctor Prince says: "Oh no!"
Doctor Prince says: "Oh no!"
Doctor Prince says: "Oh no!"
Doctor Prince says: "Oh no!"
Doctor Prince says: "Oh no!"
He jumps over some mushrooms.
Fionna says: "Fire the laser cannon!"
The penguin fires laser beam out of its beak which hits Doctor Prince.
Doctor Prince says: "Ah!"
Cake says: "Good job, girl!"
Cake says: "Have some spaghetti!"
Cake shoves a ball of spaghetti into Fionna's mouth.
Fionna says: "Thanks!"
Doctor Prince says: "Ha!"
Doctor Prince says: "Too bad I'm a really strong guy and I took my doctor pills this morning!"
Doctor Prince says: "Lasers don't hurt me!"
Doctor Prince throws a stranded dolphin at Fionna and Cake, but it misses.
Dolphin says: "Next time..."
Fionna says: "Give us the Enchiridion!"
Cake says: "Give us the Enchiridion!"
Doctor Prince says: "Ooh ooh ooh!"
Fionna says: "Thanks..."
Cake says: "That's not a book!"
Cake says: "It's a bomb!"
Fionna throws the bomb into the air, and it explodes into confetti. Then the real Enchiridion opens and Ice King pops out of its pages, slapping Doctor Prince.
Ice King says: "You've been acting like a real knucklehead, Doctor Prince."
Ice King says: "Go on, get out of here!"
Ice King says: "And don't ever do wrong things again!"
Doctor Prince says: "..."
Doctor Prince says: "You're right."
Doctor Prince says: "I see your side of things."
Doctor Prince flips a switch on his belt, and flies away.
Fionna says: "You saved the day mega-rad cool guy!"
Fionna says: "What's your name?"
Ice King says: "Oh, Ice King."
Ice King says: "I'm such a great guy!"
Ice King says: "This book is yours..."
Fionna says: "The Enchiridion!"
Fionna says: "I want to be your best and closest friend."
Ice King says: "Let's have a best and closest friend lunch!"
Ice King says: "It's mac'n'cheezles!"
Fionna says: "Awww..."
Fionna says: "what a good guy!"
Cake says: "Aww, what a sweetie!"
Fionna and cake hug Ice King.
Ice King says: "I'm just so glad you guys are real..."
Ice King says: "you're really, really real!"
Ice King says: "I wanna remember this day forever!"
Ice King shoves some Mac and cheese in his pocket.
Fionna says: "Don't be sad, Ice King!"
Fionna says: "We're going on a space adventure!"
Cake says: "Hop on, baby!"
Ice King hops on Cake as she releases a laser beam on the ground, similar to a rocket.
Ice King says: "Weehee hee!"
Fionna says: "Here we gooo!!!!"
Slime Princess says: "Ice King, stop, please."
Slime Princess says: "This story is terrible!"
Scene cuts to the Ice Kingdom.
Ice King says: "Hm?"
Ice King says: "Wha—"
Ice King says: "?"
Slime Princess, Turtle Princess, Wildberry Princess and Toast Princess all mumble in agreement.
Toast Princess says: "..."
Toast Princess says: "I don't even understand..."
Wildberry Princess says: "Maybe this story is a new form of torture!"
Ice King says: "Oh, come on!"
Ice King says: "It's a first draft..."
Ice King says: "don't hate!"
Ice King says: "And besides, that story had everything."
Ice King says: "Action, adventure, a hotter, older guy..."
Ice King says: "Wildberry, don't pretend; I know you like the silver foxes."
Wildberry Princess looks stressed and disgusted as Ice King's eyebrows go up and down.
Slime Princess says: "What if it were a..."
Slime Princess says: "little more like real life?"
Ice King says: "Real?"
Ice King says: "It's based on the real Fionna and Cake!"
Slime Princess says: "Yeah..."
Slime Princess says: "but what if there was a little more romance in the story?"
Princesses mumble in agreement.
Wildberry Princess says: "Romance is a great idea!"
Ice King says: "Y'all are just hatin' on my steeze!"
Ice King says: "I'm not listening to haters."
Ice King says: "Haters!"
Suddenly, Ice King's gown goes up over his face, and the Princesses' cages are opened.
Ice King says: "What the..."
Ice King says: "Whoa..."
Ice King says: "I'm sorry I didn't think you were real, Gob..."
Ice King says: "but now I've seen your power, and I've got some things that I did that I have to say sorry for."
Marceline makes herself visible.
Marceline says: "Boo."
Ice King says: "Marceline, how long have you been in here?"
Marceline says: "Mmm..."
Marceline says: "couple hours."
Ice King says: "Oh, so you heard my story, then..."
Ice King says: "Awesome, right?"
Marceline says: "It's..."
Marceline says: "good..."
Marceline says: "but, maybe it's time to let someone else try."
Marceline says: "Listen up, y'all!"
Marceline says: "I've got a story of my own!"
Scene shifts to the internal story; Fionna is swinging her weapons in the tree fort, and one of them nails an apple just above BMO's head.
Fionna says: "Hyah!"
Fionna says: "Hyah!"
Cake says: "Ooh, nice throw!"
Fionna says: "Thanks!"
Fionna says: "I've got to do something today."
Cake says: "What about Gumball's mission we went on this morning?"
Cake says: "Delivering daisy chains to the fluffy people not enough for you?"
Fionna says: "Uh..."
Fionna says: "sometimes Gumball's missions can be so..."
Fionna says: "lame."
Fionna throws another weapon, which cuts right through Prince Gumball's hair.
Prince Gumball says: "Hello, every—"
Fionna and Cake gasp.
Prince Gumball says: "Oh my!"
Prince Gumball says: "Looks like you almost skronked up my dome piece!"
Prince Gumball says: "Boy, have I got a treat for you two!"
Prince Gumball says: "The fluffy people and I baked these in appreciation for the mission you completed."
Prince Gumball says: "They're cream puffs..."
Prince Gumball says: "try one."
Fionna says: "Uh..."
Fionna says: "I'd love to, but..."
Fionna says: "maybe later..."
They hear a thumping sound outside.
Fionna says: "What was that?"
While they are distracted, something flashes by and grabs all of Prince Gumball's cream puffs.
Prince Gumball says: "Aww..."
Fionna says: "Something's on the roof!"
Fionna says: "Come on!"
Cake says: "I'm not going out there!"
Cake says: "It's wet."
Prince Gumball says: "It is wet..."
Fionna says: "Mhnn..."
Fionna carries Gumball up to the roof, where Marshall Lee is playing his bass.
Prince Gumball says: "Oh..."
Prince Gumball says: "it's just him."
Marshall Lee says: "Oh, hey Fionna."
Fionna says: "Marshall Lee!"
Prince Gumball says: "Ahem!"
Marshall Lee says: "Oh, forgive me!"
Marshall Lee says: "Hello, your majesty!"
Marshall Lee bows for Prince Gumball. He sucks the red out of one of the cream puffs.
Prince Gumball says: "Fionna, take me back inside."
Marshall Lee says: "What?"
Marshall Lee says: "Is he kidding?"
Marshall throws cream puff at Gumball.
Prince Gumball says: "Oh, honestly!"
Prince Gumball says: "I'm going in."
Prince Gumball says: "Come and join me when you want more polite company."
Fionna says: "Be careful!"
Prince Gumball says: "Whoa!"
Fionna says: "You got it!"
Marshall Lee says: "What a wad."
Fionna says: "A..."
Fionna says: "a gumwad?"
Cake says: "Fionna!"
Marshall Lee says: "Let's ditch him!"
Fionna says: "Uh..."
Marshall Lee says: "Lumpy Space Prince is throwing a party in the woods!"
Marshall Lee says: "It's gonna be freaky nasty!"
Fionna says: "Umm..."
Marshall Lee says: "I know you're gonna say yes to me, so..."
Marshall Lee says: "Let's just go."
Fionna rides Marshall in his bat form to Lumpy Space Prince's party. Lumpy Space Prince and Female Cinnamon Bun are dancing together.
Lumpy Space Prince says: "Oh, yeah!"
Lumpy Space Prince says: "Mmmm!"
Marshall Lee says: "This looks fun..."
Marshall Lee says: "bunch."
Marshall Lee says: "Come on."
Lumpy Space Prince says: "You guys!"
Lumpy Space Prince says: "Marshall Lee's gonna play a song, you guys!"
Everyone cheers as Fionna and Marshall Lee take the stage. The song Good Little Girl begins.
Marshall Lee says: "Follow my lead."
Marshall starts dancing, and Fionna mimics him. Marshall begins to shake his bum.
Fionna says: "Hey!"
Marhsall Lee says: "♫ Good little girl."
Marhsall Lee says: "Always picking a fight with me, you know that I'm bad..."
Marhsall Lee says: "But you're spending the night with me..."
Marhsall Lee says: "What do you want from my world?"
Marhsall Lee says: "You're a good little girl."
Fionna says: "♫ Bad little boy."
Crowd cheers.
Fionna says: "♫ That's what you're acting like, I really don't buy..."
Fionna says: "that you're that kind of guy..."
Fionna says: "and if you are, why do you want to hang out with me?"
Marshall Lee says: "♫ Don't you know I'm a villain?"
Marshall Lee says: "Every night I'm out killin', sending everyone runnin' like children."
Marshall Lee says: "I know why you're mad at me."
Marshall Lee says: "I've got demon eyes, and they're looking right through your anatomy..."
Marshall Lee says: "into your deepest fears."
Marshall Lee says: "Baby, I'm not from here."
Marshall Lee says: "I'm from the Nightosphere..."
Marshall Lee says: "To me, you're clear."
Marshall Lee says: "Transparent."
Marshall Lee says: "You got a thing for me, girl; it's apparent."
Cake says: "♫ Oh, oh!"
Cake says: "And I gots two hot tomatas!"
Cake says: "Well they'll make a good sauce maybe..."
Fionna says: "You're not so bad, you know."
Marshall Lee says: "Not so bad?"
Marshall Lee says: "I'm the son of a demon..."
Marshall Lee says: "and the Vampire King."
Marshall Lee says: "It's not something I have to try at."
Marshall Lee says: "You on the other hand..."
Cake says: "♫..."
Cake says: "on the table..."
Cake says: "the table..."
Cake says: "for as long as I am able!"
Fionna says: "I'm not trying to be bad..."
Fionna says: "I'm hanging out with you because you're my friend."
Marshall Lee says: "What?"
Fionna says: "No..."
Fionna says: "different!"
Marshall playfully trips Fionna.
Fionna says: "Hey!"
Fionna says: "Yah!"
Fionna kicks his feet in an attempt to trip him.
Fionna elbows him in the stomach to force him to the ground; he kicks her away.
Cake says: "Hey, break it up, you too!!"
Marshall pushes Cake to the side.
Marshall Lee says: "Out of my way, kitty."
Fionna says: "Hey!"
Marshall Lee says: "Oh, come on!"
Marshall Lee says: "That was funny!"
Fionna says: "Cake!"
Fionna says: "You okay?"
Cake says: "Yeah..."
Fionna says: "Come on, let's get outta here."
Marshall Lee says: "Hey!"
Marshall Lee says: "Come on..."
Marshall Lee says: "where you goin'?"
Marshall Lee says: "What's the deal?"
Marshall Lee says: "You're missing the party!"
Marshall Lee says: "Fionna, lighten up!"
Fionna says: "Look, I don't care if you're being a jerk to me..."
Fionna says: "but nobody messes with Cake."
Marshall Lee says: "Oh, really?"
Marshall Lee says: "Well, what if I just take her right now, you know?"
Fionna says: "What?"
Marshall Lee steals Cake.
Marshall Lee says: "Unexpected!"
Fionna says: "MARSHALL!"
Marshall laughs evilly.
Fionna says: "Cake!"
Marshall Lee says: "You want your Cake back?"
Marshall Lee says: "Come and get her!"
Marshall summons the undead to attack Fionna, and one of them starts a beat.
Marshall Lee says: "Already dead, so I'm not scared of dying..."
Marshall Lee says: "Drinking the red from your heart in one sitting."
Marshall Lee says: "You think you've got me pegged, you must be kidding."
Marshall Lee says: "I raise the dead up, and they do my bidding."
Marshall Lee says: "Girl, I'm a thousand years old, I'm a riddle..."
Marshall Lee says: "Bad little boy!"
Marshall Lee says: "Yes, I'm bad, but not little."
Cake says: "Uh-uh boy, what are you thinking?"
Cake grows then Marshall counters it with his bat form.
Cake says: "Fionna!"
Fionna says: "Cake!"
Cake says: "Grab onto my little paws!"
Fionna pulls Cake from Marshall Lee's grasp, causing him to impale himself on a stake.
Fionna says: "Marshall?"
Marshall Lee says: "Oh, this is bad, guys..."
Marshall Lee says: "This is really bad!"
Fionna says: "Marshall!"
Sunlight begins to burn Marshall's face.
Fionna says: "Come on!"
Fionna says: "You gotta be okay!"
Marshall Lee says: "This is it for me, Fionna..."
Marshall Lee says: "so..."
Marshall Lee says: "why don't you just admit it..."
Marshall Lee says: "?"
Marshall Lee says: "You're in love with me..."
Fionna says: "I-I get that you flirt with me all the time, and it's funny or whatever, but you're doing that now?!"
Fionna says: "!"
Fionna says: "What are you trying to do to my head?"
Fionna says: "You think I've got some little crush on you?"
Fionna says: "Well, for however long we've got left..."
Fionna says: "FOR ONCE, DROP IT, YOU FREAK!"
Marshall Lee pulls out the stake, revealing his shirt was stuffed with cream puffs.
Marshall Lee says: "Faking it!"
Marshall Lee says: "Faking it!"
Marshall Lee says: "Okay, my shirt is, like, filled with cream puffs!"
Cake says: "Oh, goodness!"
Marshall Lee says: "Glob, Fionna..."
Marshall Lee says: "you're like the realest person I've ever met..."
Marshall Lee says: "Ow, my cheek meat!"
Fionna begins to cry and laugh hysterically.
Marshall Lee says: "Quit clowning, Fionna."
Marshall Lee says: "F-Fionna?"
Marshall Lee says: "Fionna!"
He gets punched again. The story ends.
Marceline says: "The end."
Princesses mumble in satisfaction.
Turtle Princess says: "Oh hohoho!"
Turtle Princess says: "I loved that one!"
Ice King says: "Oh, come on!"
Ice King says: "You guys got mad at me for a bad story?"
Ice King says: "I mean it's cute, but..."
Ice King says: "that's not how'd they be!"
Ice King says: "But look, it might not be too late to polish this piece off—"
Ice King says: "let's spitball off some ideas."
Ice King says: "Like, if Marshall Lee gets sick and dies, but he's got a brother we didn't know about!"
Ice King says: "His name's Marshall Lee..."
Ice King says: "roy."
Ice King says: "Boom, shocker!"
Ice King says: "Uh-huh!"
Ice King says: "I feel goosebumps!"
Slime Princess says: "I like how it is!"
All the other princesses agree.
Turtle Princess says: "Yeah, don't change it!"
Wildberry Princess says: "Yeah!"
Wildberry Princess says: "It's good!"
Ice King says: "I know you're out there somewhere..."
Ice King says: "I just haven't figured out how to get to you..."
Ice King says: "but believe me, I will!"
Ice King says: "I will..."
Episode ends.
