The episode begins in the Desert Lands. The camera pans down a gigantic pillar of sand leading to an underground city. Finn and Jake are at the base of a sand column next to some sand sculptures of soldiers.
Finn says: "What's wrong with you, man?"
Jake says: "I ate all the candy in your backpack, and now I'm sick."
Finn says: "I didn't bring any candy."
Jake says: "Oh, no."
Jake says: "That explains why it didn't taste right."
Finn says: "Nothing tastes right today."
Finn says: "Like, I thought we were going to get into some serious flavor with these sand people, but they're just standing around like garnish."
Jake says: "That's how I feel—"
Jake says: "like a dying parsley."
Jake says: "So what's goin' on with the spoon?"
Jake says: "Marceline and the spoon."
Finn says: "Um..."
Finn says: "Wait, there she goes!"
Marceline says: "A spoon."
Finn says: "Yea-uh."
Finn says: "The Spoon of Prosperity!"
Jake says: "It doesn't look like mu—"
The belch echoes and causes more sculptures to crumble.
Jake says: "Oh, my gosh, I feel so much better!"
Jake says: "Hungry, even."
Jake says: "Guys, let's go home!"
Finn says: "We've gotta get this spoon to Princess Bubblegum first."
Jake says: "♪Let's rock!"
Marceline says: "What's PB want with that spoon, anyway?"
Finn says: "Beats me."
Jake says: "Sometimes it's better not to know."
Marceline says: "Yeah, I guess that's true with Bonnibel."
Jake says: "Hey, guys, look what I found!"
Marceline says: "Is that quicksand?"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Heh."
Jake says: "Quicksand is pretty fun."
Jake says: "Heh."
Finn says: "Quit messing around, Jake."
Jake says: "Okie-doke."
Jake stretches an arm from his head to the support underneath the platform Finn and Marceline are on. The support crumbles, and Finn falls.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
More structures behind them crumble.
Jake says: "Hmm."
Jake says: "Hey, is this whole place made out of sand?"
Marceline says: "Sure looks that way."
Jake says: "Uh, give me a pull, please."
Jake says: "Flesh drill!"
Finn says: "I'm not sure that's a good idea—"
Jake starts drilling, rumbling the entire city.
Jake says: "Yaah!"
Jake says: "Rug burn!"
Jake says: "Ow!"
Jake says: "Ow!"
The large pillar of sand collapses.
Jake says: "Aah!"
Jake says: "Whoo!"
Jake says: "It worked!"
Jake says: "Jake drill worked, you guys."
Marceline grabs them and floats upwards to avoid the avalanche of sand coming their way.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Check it out!"
Jake says: "My piggies are free."
Marceline says: "You just demolished half the underground city!"
Jake says: "Yeah, only half."
Finn says: "You also sealed our exit."
Jake says: "Our only exit."
Jake says: "No regre-e-e-ets!"
Jake says: "This little piggie stayed home, and so should have I."
Jake says: "I know!"
Jake says: "I'll dig us out of here."
Finn says: "No!"
Marceline says: "No!"
Finn says: "You'll bury us alive!"
Marceline says: "Undead!"
Finn says: "Finn to PB."
Finn says: "Come in, PB."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, hi, Finn."
Finn says: "Princess, we're trapped in the underground city."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yeah-yeah."
Princess Bubblegum says: "That sounds great."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "No, we need help!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "That's great!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Gre-gre-great!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Great, great!"
Marceline says: "Any more bright ideas?"
Jake says: "Snacks!"
Marceline says: "How are snacks gonna get us out of here?"
Jake says: "I wanna eat snacks..."
Jake says: "because I am hungry."
Marceline says: "I'm hungry, too."
Marceline says: "Bust the snacks, Finn."
Jake says: "Bust, bust, bust!"
Finn takes off his pack and dumps its contents on the ground. Jake takes a cookie out of the pile.
Marceline says: "Hey, where are my red erasers?"
Marceline says: "They were in here."
Jake says: "Uh-oh."
Jake says: "I thought they were candy."
Marceline says: "You..."
Marceline says: "ate all..."
Marceline says: "MY RED?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Marceline says: "?!"
Marceline says: "!"
Jake says: "Oooh."
Jake says: "I'm sorry!"
Finn says: "Calm down, Marceline."
Finn says: "There's gotta be some red stuff in these ruins."
Finn says: "I'll go explore."
Finn says: "You guys hang out here and save your energy."
Marceline says: "Thanks, Finn."
Finn says: "Be cool."
Jake says: "So how hungry are you?"
Jake says: "Aah!"
Jake says: "I'm sorry."
Jake says: "Please don't eat my blood!"
Marceline says: "Jake, I don't want to hurt you, but you should know things get crazy when I'm hungry."
Jake says: "Like..."
Jake says: "how crazy?"
Marceline says: "I'm gonna go into feral mode."
Marceline says: "It's not gonna be pretty."
Marceline says: "I know."
Marceline says: "Let's tie me up."
Marceline says: "That way, you won't be scared."
Jake says: "And that will keep you from draining my bloods?"
Marceline says: "Not physically, no, but as a prop, I think it'll be good for both of us."
Marceline says: "You know, psychologically."
Jake says: "Hurry, Finn."
Scene cuts to Finn passing some streams of lava.
Finn says: "Red, red, red."
Finn says: "I guess even a vampire queen's face would melt off if she tried to eat lava."
Scene switches to Marceline, who is tied up to a sand column.
Marceline says: "Get me a bucket of lava, Jake."
Jake says: "Yo, you know better than that."
Marceline says: "Do iiiit..."
Jake says: "Don't go crazy, okay?"
Marceline says: "I'm frickin' hungry."
Scene cuts back to Finn. He arrives at a large door of sand held up by four skeletons, behind which some red light is emanating.
Finn says: "Okay, here we go."
Finn says: "Yeah, look at that!"
Finn says: "Oh, dag."
Finn looks into a room full of immobile sand people bathing in the red light coming from a crown on a skeleton at the other side of the room.
Finn says: "Cool..."
Finn says: "What the heck happened here?"
Finn says: "Whatever's down there's gotta have red blasting out of every hole."
Finn says: "Hey, you're not still alive, right?"
The skeleton does not respond.
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "I was just making sure."
Finn says: "This hole is deep."
Scene cuts back to Jake.
Jake says: "Oh, my Glob."
Jake says: "Oh, my Glob, where are you, man?"
Jake says: "Marcy's wiggin' out!"
Marceline says: "Jaaaake..."
Jake says: "What?"
Marceline says: "I can smell your insides, Jake."
Marceline says: "red!"
Marceline says: "Yeah, lemme see in there."
Marceline says: "Oh, yeah."
Scene cuts back to Finn.
Finn says: "Maybe I should go back."
Finn says: "Well, I've already gone this far."
Finn says: "Oops."
Crab Demon says: "Paris?"
Crab Demon says: "Is that you?"
Finn says: "You mean the guy with the big thing on his head?"
Crab Demon says: "Yes."
Crab Demon says: "Have you returned to complete the plan?"
Finn says: "Naw."
Finn says: "Paris is, like, super dead."
Crab Demon says: "What?!"
Crab Demon says: "!"
Crab Demon says: "No!"
Crab Demon says: "How long?"
Finn says: "Dude, like, a really long time."
Finn says: "Like five hundred years."
Crab Demon says: "Chum!"
Crab Demon says: "I must've zoned out!"
Finn says: "What the heck were you two doing?"
Crab Demon says: "Once we turned the city to sand, we were gonna reanimate their bodies and conquer my homeland at the center of the planet."
Finn says: "Hm, that's dumb."
Crab Demon says: "Time to go back home a true loser."
Finn says: "Can I have this big ol' ruby, then?"
Crab Demon says: "That's an emerald."
Finn says: "Clearly it's a big ol' ruby."
Crab Demon says: "I don't know what to tell you, man."
Finn says: "I would like the ruby."
Crab Demon says: "It's yours, buddy."
Finn says: "Peace."
Finn says: "Hyup!"
Finn says: "Whoops."
Scene cuts to Marceline, who is buried up to her demonic face in sand.
Jake says: "Okay,  all done now."
Jake says: "Nice and snug, right?"
Marceline says: "Jake..."
Jake says: "What?"
Marceline says: "I won't be able to..."
Marceline says: "to control myself much longer."
Marceline says: "I can feel the feeding frenzy coming on."
Jake says: "You're sick!"
Marceline says: "Yeah..."
Jake says: "C'mon, Jake, think..."
Marceline says: "What?"
Scene cuts back to Finn, who is pushing the ruby back through the tunnel.
Marceline says: "What are you doing?"
Jake says: "I'm cooking up a crazy vampire!"
Jake says: "That should heat up nice!"
Jake says: "The sand will keep the meat moist."
Marceline says: "You're gonna eat me?"
Jake says: "You was gonna eat me!"
Marceline says: "Yes, I am."
Jake says: "Cook, baby, cook!"
Finn arrives with the ruby.
Jake says: "Finn!"
Finn says: "Bleh."
Finn says: "The trick is rollin' it."
Finn says: "Phew!"
Finn says: "Check out this ruby I got."
Jake says: "That's an emerald, dude."
Finn says: "You too now?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Emeralds are green, boyee."
Jake says: "This thing is green."
Finn says: "Why is everybody messin' with me?"
Finn says: "It's like a dark gray-ish red."
Finn says: "Mostly gray."
Finn says: "Sometimes red things are gray!"
Jake says: "You're a little colorblind..."
Jake says: "and there's nothin' to be ashamed of!"
The "ruby" is now green.
Finn says: "Oh..."
Finn says: "whoops."
Jake says: "I'm sorry you had to push that thing so far."
Finn says: "Uh, what's goin' on with Marcy?"
Jake says: "She was threatening to eat my insides, so I'm cooking her."
Jake says: "I know that sounds crazy, but I had no choice."
Marceline is now missing.
Jake says: "I'm operating on my lowest survival brain function right now."
Jake says: "What?"
Finn says: "Chill, man!"
Jake says: "No, we gotta book!"
Jake says: "Go!"
Marceline says: "I gotta suck out your insides first, right?"
Finn says: "Nay-nay, brah!"
Marceline says: "Time to eat!"
Marceline says: "Huh?"
Marceline says: "What the—"
Marceline says: "?"
A large worm breaks through the ceiling. Princess Bubblegum is in its mouth, controlling it.
Finn says: "Bubblegum?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hey, guys."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I saw my seismograph had gone off the charts, so I figured you might be in trouble, right?"
Jake says: "Yeah, but watch out for Marceline."
Jake says: "She's gone rabid!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "What?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Marceline's gonna rap for me?"
Marceline grabs Princess Bubblegum and bites her hair.
Marceline says: "Woof."
Marceline says: "Thanks, Bonnie."
Marceline says: "That's enough low-grade red to get me home, at least."
Marceline says: "Come on, guys."
Marceline says: "Let's go."
Finn says: "Are you alright, PB?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Did you get the Spoon of Prosperity?"
Princess Bubblegum places it on her nose, and she returns to normal.
Finn says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "Whoa."
 says: "Whoa."
Marceline says: "Whoa."
Finn, Jake, and Marceline applaud.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Peeps will never starve in my eternal empire."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Sand worm, up!"
The sand worm leaps upward as the city fills with lava.
Episode ends.
