The episode begins with a pterodactyl flying and carrying Finn and Jake. It drops them off at their Tree Fort and flies away. Finn and Jake run inside. Jake empties a treasure chest of gold coins while Finn places his Demon Sword in the mouth of a taxidermied triclops.
Jake says: "Loot, bro!"
Finn says: "Gear dumped, bro!"
Finn says: "How about this room, bro?"
Jake says: "Looks like a brolicious room to relax in and play video games..."
Jake says: "bro."
They run over to the couch and sit down.
Finn says: "Home, sweet home, bro."
Ice King says: "Yeah, you said it."
Ice King says: "I've been home this whole time."
Jake says: "I keep forgetting that he lives here now."
Finn says: "Just until Gunter finishes rebuilding the Ice Kingdom."
Ice King says: "What y'all whisperin' about?"
Jake says: "Ice King, we've told you a thousand times: this couch ain't for cuddlin'."
Ice King says: "Sure it is."
Jake says: "It isn't!"
Ice King says: "Mm, it's cozy."
Finn says: "It's not that bad, Jake."
Ice King says: "See?"
Jake says: "Finn, can I speak to you in the kitchen?"
Finn and Jake get off the couch and walk towards the kitchen.
Ice King says: "Oh, hey, Jake, can you bring me a sandwich?"
Ice King says: "Sandwich?"
They're in the kitchen. Finn is making a sandwich.
Jake says: "It's time to kick Ice King out!!"
Ice King says: "Don't forget the bread!"
Ice King says: "Haha!"
Finn says: "Look, I hear you."
Finn says: "But we can't kick him out because I still feel guilty about junking up his crib."
Finn says: "Hey, what if we check him into a hotel room?"
Jake says: "Hmmm?"
Finn says: "What's that?"
Jake says: "Checking him to a hotel room."
Finn giving the sandwich to Ice King.
Ice King says: "Oooh!"
Ice King says: "Sandwich time!"
Jake kicks Finn.
Finn says: "Hey, Simon, how would you like to stay in the Coolest Hotel?"
Jake says: "Lumpy Space Princess stays there."
Jake says: "That's how cool it is."
Finn says: "We'll even put you up for few weeks until your place is ready."
Ice King says: "Ahh, but that sounds lonely."
Ice King says: "I just like to stay here with you guys!"
Ice King says: "Having roommates is nice!"
Ice King says: "It keeps me out of my head."
Ice King says: "Gunther says only "Wenk!"
Ice King says: "" What's up with that?"
Finn says: "Hehe, yeah?"
Jake pulls Finn at the back.
Jake says: "Finn, I'm ready to murder the Ice King."
Finn says: "No."
Finn says: "I-I have another idea."
The time passes by. Ice King is lying down while eating cocoa cereal and has his robe taken off. The bowl of the cereal is on his belly. He scratches his right leg and eats another spoon. The bowl accidentally falls off.
Ice King says: "Oop."
Jake's right eye twitches. He looks disgusted. A doorbell rings.
Finn says: "Oh, my gosh!"
Finn says: "Someone's at the door."
Finn says: "We have a doorbell now."
Finn says: "We'll get it."
Finn and Jake walk out. Ice King senses suspicion. Finn opens the door.
Finn says: "Abracadaniel?!"
Jake says: "Abracadaniel?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "What are you doing here?"
Abracadaniel says: "What?"
Abracadaniel says: "You kept calling and call..."
Jake says: "Hahaha!"
Jake says: "Shut up-up-up-up-up, Abracadeez!"
Finn says: "Yeah, man!"
Finn says: "You don't even need a reason to stop by!"
Jake says: "A sexy wizard like you goes where he wants!"
Ice King says: "Whoa-oh!"
Ice King says: "I see what's going on!"
Jake says: "What..."
Jake says: "You do?"
Ice King says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Dang!"
Finn says: "But you're funny, Abracadaniel!"
Abracadaniel says: "I didn't say anything."
Finn says: "Fantastic."
Jake says: "Hey, Abadabs!"
Abracadaniel says: "Oh?"
Abracadaniel says: "Uhh."
Abracadaniel says: "Yeah!"
Abracadaniel says: "I suppose I could!"
Finn and Jake start clapping.
Finn says: "So good!"
Finn says: "Whoo!"
Jake says: "You're a good wizard!"
Abracadaniel says: "I don't know, it's dumb!"
Abracadaniel says: "I'm still working on it!"
Abracadaniel says: "It's-It's nothing!"
Ice King comes out of his room angrily.
Ice King says: "Oh, you're right that ain't nothing!"
Ice King says: "Check out this wizar!"
Ice King says: "What?"
Abracadaniel says: "Ohh!"
Abracadaniel says: "You're the greatest wizard ever!"
Ice King says: "Well, maybe not ever ever!"
Ice King says: "Am I the greatest wizard in our generation?"
Ice King says: "Yes."
Finn and Jake look at each other and exchange excited looks because their plan is going good. Abracadaniel and Ice King have fun. They play a game in BMO. They play Hide and Shoot. So Abracadaniel pretends to be hit and dies on the table. Ice King jumps on him and elbows him the stomach causing the table to break. They're cloud-watching and imagining Princesses in the clouds. And they make their BFF handshake. Finn and Jake are in their room reading.
Jake says: "This was a great idea, man!"
Jake says: "It's like he's forgotten all about us!"
Finn says: "Uhh-huh."
Finn says: "Pretty soon, he'll be outta here for good."
Jake says: "For good!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Ice King?"
Finn says: "What's up?"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "What the flip?"
Ice King says: "Tada!"
Jake says: "How'd they get the other couch down here?"
Abracadaniel says: "There you are, sir."
Abracadaniel says: "There you are."
Abracadaniel says: "Right this way."
Finn shrugs at Jake. He and Jake sit down in their seats which say A3 and A4.
BMO says: "You made it!"
Ice King gives a drum roll. Abracadaniel runs through the curtain.
Abracadaniel says: "Caw!"
Abracadaniel says: "Tada!"
BMO says: "A bird!"
BMO says: "He's a bird!"
Abracadaniel says: "I've always been into interpretive dance."
Abracadaniel says: "But I've never been able to find a musician who could match my energy until now!"
Jake says: "Huh!"
Jake says: "He's actually not bad!"
Abracadaniel says: "No!"
BMO says: "Awww!"
Abracadaniel says: "No!"
BMO says: "Ow!"
BMO says: "No!"
Abracadaniel says: "Ow!"
Abracadaniel says: "Why are you doing this?!"
Abracadaniel says: "!"
BMO says: "You pushed my whole body!"
Finn says: "Um,  whoo!"
Finn says: "That was great, guys!"
Abracadaniel says: "Yeah?"
Abracadaniel says: "You guys liked it?"
Ice King says: "Well, then the second and third acts are gonna knock your socks off!"
Finn says: "Uh,  actually, Jake and I have got, uh, got some stuff to take care of."
Jake says: "Yeah..."
Jake says: "It's getting pretty late."
Ice King and Abracadaniel look at each other.
Abracadaniel says: "Uh..."
Abracadaniel says: "oh, Glob."
Finn says: "'Sup, ABD?"
Abracadaniel says: "I just remember that I'm, uh, a-allergic, uh, to, to the night sky."
Finn says: "You're afraid of the dark?"
Abracadaniel says: "Yes, if I ever had to walk, uh, outside at night, I might die of-of..."
Ice King says: "Of fright."
Abracadaniel says: "Of fright!"
Jake looks behind to see Ice King behind him and Finn.
Finn says: "Gee."
Finn says: "Well, I guess you can crash here for the night."
Abracadaniel says: "All right!"
Ice King says: "Sleepover!!"
Abracadaniel says: "Sleepover!!"
Finn says: "Wait!"
Finn says: "Are you really afraid of the dark?"
Abracadaniel says: "Maybe."
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "Well, you can sleep on the couch."
Finn says: "We're gonna go."
Finn says: "Uh, good night."
Ice King and Abracadaniel laugh secretly like they're planning some kind of evil plan. They both go downstairs where Finn and Jake's treasures are.
Abracadaniel says: "Whoa!"
Ice King says: "See, I told you!"
Ice King says: "Isn't it awesome?"
Ice King says: "Eh, since I'm pretty much in charge here, we can totally take all this treasure if we wanted to."
Abracadaniel says: "Ha!"
Abracadaniel says: "Totally!"
They both walk closely to the treasures.
Abracadaniel says: "Wow!"
Abracadaniel says: "Cool!"
Ice King says: "Oh, that's just a byncomire."
Abracadaniel says: "Ohh!"
Ice King says: "Wanna see something really cool?"
Abracadaniel says: "Yeah!"
Ice King says: "Okay, but you gotta promise not to freak out!"
Abracadaniel nods. Ice King walks over to the sword's holder. He takes the sword.
Ice King says: "This is Joshua the Dog's Demon Blood Sword."
Ice King says: "Yeah!"
Ice King says: "It's a real demon blood sword."
Abracadaniel says: "What?!"
Abracadaniel says: "!"
Ice King peels off the handle.
Ice King says: "And you see these words?"
Ice King says: "If you say them out loud, you can actually see a vision of the demon whose blood was used to make the sword!"
Abracadaniel says: "No way!"
Abracadaniel says: "That sounds awesome!"
Abracadaniel says: "Too bad neither of us can read Demon Runes."
Ice King says: "Ooh!"
Ice King says: "I know how!"
Ice King says: "Butyrum lac surepo kee oth pradium, like that!"
Kee-Oth appears.
Ice King says: "Oops."
Abracadaniel says: "Wow!"
Abracadaniel says: "It looks so real!"
Kee-Oth says: "I am real!"
Ice King and Abracadaniel scream. Ice King wraps the handle back on and returns the sword to its holder.
Kee-Oth says: "Bring me the true bearer of my blood sword or I will destroy you both!"
Kee-Oth starts growling while Ice King and Abracadaniel walk back.
Ice King says: "Come on, best friend,  let us not betray Finn!"
Ice King says: "Let's fight Kee-Oth ourselves!"
Abracadaniel says: "Nobody can defeat us if we work together!"
Abracadaniel says: "Super Wizard Team Up!"
Ice King continuously attacks Kee Oth with lightning bolts while Abracadaniel continuously attacks with flowers.
Kee-Oth says: "You're wasting your powers on me."
Kee-Oth says: "Haha!"
Ice King says: "Oh!"
Ice King says: "No!"
Ice King says: "Oh, no!"
Ice King says: "He's too powerful!"
He and Abracadaniel yell. Kee-Oth grabs them by their necks. Finn and Jake arrive.
Finn says: "Kee-Oth!"
Jake says: "Kee-Oth!"
Kee-Oth says: "Joshua!"
Finn says: "Kee Oth Rama Pancake..."
Jake says: "Kee Oth Rama Pancake..."
Kee-Oth says: "Don't say another word, Joshua!"
Kee-Oth says: "Or the throats are going to get it!"
Kee-Oth says: "If you speak the words to banish me, I'll reduce your friends to ash!"
Jake says: "Kee Oth Rama P..."
Finn says: "Dude!!"
Jake says: "I thought he was bluffing."
Kee-Oth says: "I'm not bluffing, Joshua!"
Finn and Jake run towards the sword's holder.
Finn says: "Ahh!"
Finn says: "The sword!"
Jake says: "Scary!"
Finn takes the sword.
Finn says: "I just can't do it, Jake."
Finn says: "This is Dad's sword!"
Jake says: "You don't have any other choice!"
Jake says: "Do it!"
Kee-Oth says: "Do it!!"
Finn says: "Whoa."
The bloods go to Kee Oth. He drops Ice King and Abracadaniel. He becomes red and much bigger.
Finn says: "You got your blood, now get outta here!"
Abracadaniel and Ice King walk towards Finn.
Abracadaniel says: "Uh, hey, so, uh, I should be getting home."
Ice King says: "Uh, yeah, me, too."
Ice King says: "Hey, Abracadaniel, wanna hang out at my place?"
Abracadaniel says: "I thought your house broke."
Ice King says: "Ice Kingdom's been rebuilt for weeks!"
They both leave.
Finn says: "Jake?"
Episode ends.
