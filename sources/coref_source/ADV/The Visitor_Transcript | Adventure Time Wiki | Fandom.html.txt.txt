It's nighttime at the Tree Fort. Jake, Neptr, a Sea Lard, and Finn are sound asleep.
A comet passes over the Tree Fort, crashing somewhere beyond the Ice Kingdom.
Finn opens his eyes. The comet nudges his head to get his attention. It is revealed he is at the bottom of the ocean. The comet wags its tail.
Baby Finn says: "That's the comet you're supposed to follow."
Finn looks to his left and sees his younger self sitting beside him.
Finn says: "Right."
Finn says: "Right."
Finn says: "I knew that."
Baby Finn says: "Hey, be careful, okay?"
Baby Finn says: "Hold on tight."
Finn says: "It's okay."
Finn says: "I won't ever let you go."
Finn says: "That's..."
Finn says: "true."
They continue following the comet. It swims into a crevice and shines light.
Finn says: "Wow."
Finn says: "Already?"
Finn says: "That was fast."
Baby Finn says: "Yep."
Baby Finn says: "We're here."
Baby Finn says: "It's time to wake up now."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Now?"
Baby Finn says: "Yep."
Finn says: "Like, right now?"
Baby Finn says: "Ye—"
Finn wakes up, severely dehydrated. He finds himself on a hill by a dead tree.
Finn says: "And a little farming village?"
Finn says: "How long have I been walking?"
A vulture perches on the tree.
Vulture says: "Man, two whole days—"
Vulture says: "at least!"
Finn says: "Wow."
Finn says: "I need some water."
Vulture says: "No, wait—"
Vulture says: "ah..."
Vulture says: "jeez."
Finn says: "Kinda runty..."
Finn says: "I wonder if this village even has any wat—"
Finn says: "oh, snap!"
Finn says: "I see some!"
Finn runs in to the village huffing and kneels exhausted before the water tower. A villager is beside the water tower.
Finn says: "Excuse me, sir."
Finn says: "Can I have some water?"
Finn says: "I've been sleepwalking for days."
The villager nods and gestures towards the water tower.
Finn says: "Haha, awesome."
Finn says: "And it's suppose to stand straight up-like."
Finn says: "Or maybe comet boys only need just, like, a little bit of limp corn?"
The villager says: "No, I'm a regular guy."
The villager says: "I'm not just supposed to talk to strangers."
Mom says: "Lionel, what'd I tell you about talking to strangers?"
Mom says: "You get your butt inside this instant!"
Lionel, the villager, covers his mouth and bounces away.
Tree spirit says: "HUMAN BOY!"
Finn says: "What the?"
Tree spirit says: "THE TREE SPIRIT DOES NOT PERMIT FREELOADERS!"
Tree spirit says: "EITHER HELP FETCH THE ESCAPE POD ENGINE OR KINDLY MOVE ALONG!"
Finn says: "Dad?"
Finn stands up and goes to climb the tree.
Tree spirit says: "Wait, wait!"
Tree spirit says: "What are you doing?"
Tree spirit says: "DON'T COME OVER HERE."
Finn pokes his head inside a treehouse in the tree. Inside the treehouse, Martin is chewing a egg from a bird nest.
Finn says: "Dad?"
Martin says: "Finn!"
Martin says: "What the heck are you doing here?"
Finn says: "Dad!"
Finn says: "What the heck are you doing here?"
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "You were just yelling at me."
Martin says: "No, no, no, that was the tree spirit—"
Martin says: "commander of all trees, bringer of hard times."
Finn says: "Dad."
Martin says: "You're not falling for it, huh?"
Martin says: "Well, it was worth a try."
Finn looks at Martin's armless right sleeve, which is knotted.
Martin says: "You know those little guys down there, they'll do anything for the tree spirit."
Martin says: "I've got them fetching parts to fix my escape pod, instead of planting their fields."
Martin says: "Isn't that sweet?"
Finn says: "Dad, your arm."
Martin says: "Oh, this?"
Martin says: "Haha, yeah."
Martin says: "When my ship crashed I got shot out of the window."
Martin says: "I knocked a kite of the air, then caught my arm in a woodpecker hole."
Finn says: "Whoa."
Martin says: "But, it's cool, you know."
Martin says: "Arms come and go."
Martin says: "It's family that's important."
Martin says: "Speaking of arms, though, I see you got yourself a brand spanking new one."
Martin says: "How about that!"
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "I got it from my PB dream sword."
Martin says: "Uh-huh."
Martin says: "Neat."
Finn says: "Actually, for a while there, I thought if I ever saw you again, I was gonna tear your arm off."
Martin says: "Well, shoot, who could blame you?"
Martin says: "Yeah."
Martin says: "But you definitely don't feel that way anymore, right?"
Finn says: "No, no, it's okay now."
Martin says: "Haha!"
Martin says: "Great!"
Martin says: "How about a hug?"
Martin tries to hug Finn, but Finn grunts and pushes him away.
Finn says: "What the heck, Dad!"
Finn says: "Is everything you say a lie?"
Martin says: "No, no, of course not!"
Finn says: "Well, is there any way I can tell the difference?"
Martin says: "Ha ha, I hope not!"
Martin says: "Hot dang!"
Martin says: "Hold that thought!"
Martin says: "Those little guys are back with the engine bulb for my pod."
Martin says: "'Scuse me."
Martin takes his megaphone and speaks through the treehouse door.
Martin says: "I AM SENDING FORTH MY HOLY EMISSARY, MARTIN MERTENS, AND HIS REGULAR SON, FINN."
Martin says: "DON'T FORGET TO DO WHATEVER MARTIN TELLS YOU."
Finn and Martin are standing on the plowed fields. Martin is directing some villagers who are carrying a round engine part.
Martin says: "Almost there."
Martin says: "Little further."
Martin says: "Aha, little further."
Martin says: "Keep it coming."
Martin says: "There you go."
Martin says: "A li-i-ittle further."
Martin says: "A-a-and stop."
Martin says: "Fantastic work, boys, absolutely fantastic."
Finn says: "Holy stonk, Dad!"
Finn says: "You're messing 'em all up."
Finn says: "This is why you are lying to them?"
Finn says: "So they'll mess themselves up for you?"
Martin says: "What!"
Martin says: "No, no, no, look!"
Martin says: "They love it, see?"
Martin says: "They're gonna fetch me one last piece, and you and I can watch 'em do it."
Martin says: "Then I'll be outta your hair by tomorrow morning."
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Right."
Martin says: "Yeah, don't worry."
Martin says: "I know I'm cramping your style down here."
Martin says: "Am I right?"
Martin says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "yeah."
Finn says: "Yeah, I-I guess..."
Martin says: "Sure I am!"
Martin says: "Now let's go fetch that piece."
Martin, Finn and the villagers go near the crashed ship.
Finn says: "It's really warm down here."
Martin says: "Well, yeah, son."
Martin says: "That's just the ship cooking."
Martin says: "One thing about this ship, it cooks!"
Finn says: "Should it be cooking?"
Martin says: "Nah, but that's just real life."
Martin says: "Last one in breaks tree spirit's heart!"
Finn says: "Wait, wait, wai-wai-wait!"
Finn says: "You don't have to go in there if you don't want to!"
Villager with eyepatch says: "Nah, I think we want to."
The villagers go in. Finn gives a sour look to Martin.
Martin says: "Haha, come here!"
At night, the villagers are having party.
Martin says: "Yo, party animals!"
Martin says: "Still hungry?"
One of the villagers says: "Mmm."
Martin says: "Come on, tree spirit says!"
Martin says: "Scoop it till you poop it."
Martin says: "Let's get grrro-o-oss!"
Finn looks at him from a distant, until one of the villagers talks to him.
The villager says: "Finn?"
Finn says: "Oh, sorry."
Finn says: "So you guys wanna learn another one?"
Finn says: "So, you guys really believe in the tree spirit?"
Villager says: "Eh, not really, I guess."
Villager says: "We're kind of just looking to help out."
Finn says: "Hmm."
Martin says: "Hey!"
Martin says: "It's Finn with the grin!"
Martin says: "Mind if I sit down?"
Martin says: "Haha!"
Martin says: "Look at this!"
Martin says: "You ever see someone sit like this?"
Finn says: "I guess not."
Finn says: "Hey, Martin?"
Martin says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Uh, I think I really need some answers to stuff—"
Finn says: "like where did I come from or who's my mom?"
Martin says: "Haha!"
Martin says: "Whoops."
Martin says: "Okay, uh, long story short—"
Martin says: "you were born on a..."
Martin says: "boat..."
Martin says: "I guess."
Martin says: "Like a..."
Martin says: "banana boat."
Flashback begins. Thunderclouds roll over a boat as it rises and falls on the waves.
Martin says: "In the middle of the ocean."
Martin says: "So..."
Martin says: "all kinds of stuff tried to eat you—"
Martin says: "The sea's weeds."
Flashback ends.
Martin says: "Your mom was..."
Martin says: "okay?"
Martin says: "I don't know."
Martin says: "Talking about it stresses me out."
Martin says: "Maybe later."
Flashback resumes.
Martin says: "So one day, I got called on a dangerous mission—"
Martin says: "no, like a dangerous life choice, two roads diverging in the night and all that."
A villager falls asleep in Finn's pack.
Martin says: "And I couldn't bring you along."
Martin says: "I always planned to come back for you, but I didn't."
Martin says: "That's..."
Martin says: "true."
Martin says: "The end!"
At dawn the next day, Finn and the fattened villagers are sleeping in the field. A vulture flies circles over them.
Villager says: "Everything is ruined."
Villager says: "Everyone is fat."
Suddenly, part of the ship explodes and ejects a flaming piece at the ground.
Finn says: "Aah!"
Martin says: "Oh, good morning, sweetie!"
Finn says: "Martin, are you leaving?!"
Finn says: "!"
Martin says: "I absolutely gotta, kid."
Martin says: "I got pressures on me, stuff you wouldn't understand."
Finn says: "But what about the villagers?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "That ship looks like it's gonna blow up!"
Martin says: "Uh..."
Martin says: "maybe."
Martin says: "I don't know."
Martin says: "Maybe it won't blow up."
Martin says: "I've seen 100 things weirder than a ship not blowing up."
Finn says: "Oh, Dad!"
Finn says: "I need to go shut it off!"
Martin says: "Okay, okay, wait!"
Martin says: "Wait."
Martin says: "If you're gonna turn it off, you gotta pull the heat dump toggle in the engine core."
Martin says: "It was too snug for me to get to, and those little guys aren't strong enough."
Martin says: "Hmm."
Martin says: "Hey, I could wait for you."
Martin says: "Maybe we could go into space together."
Finn says: "Why didn't you tell me about the heat dump in the first place?!"
Finn says: "!"
Martin says: "I don't know..."
Martin says: "Wink!"
Finn says: "Daaaaah!"
Martin says: "What the—"
Finn runs to the spaceship and crawls inside until he reaches the engine core.
Finn says: "Heat dump!"
Finn says: "Too..."
Finn says: "stuck!"
The ship instantly starts cooling down. Finn leaves the ship through a hatch on the top and waves to the villagers on the ground, who stand up and wave back. The wind blows over the villagers' empty teepees.
Finn says: "Man, you know what's weird?"
Finn says: "That wasn't even a comet that crashed back there."
Finn says: "So, then, what was that dream about?"
Finn says: "I don't get my brain."
Finn says: "Okay, when we get back to the tree house, let me do the talking."
Episode ends.
