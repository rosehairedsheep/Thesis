Princess Bubblegum says: "Be careful!"
The stag continues to jump on Candy People and lick them. Jake and Finn pursue him.
Finn says: "Grab him, Jake!"
Finn and Jake grab on to the stag. The stag panics and runs away, throwing Jake off.
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "W-whoa!"
The stag throws Finn on the ground and stomps on his legs, breaking them.
Finn says: "Whatever."
He awakens in a hospital bed.
Finn says: "Oh, what happened?"
Finn says: "Where's the deer?"

Jake says: "Ouch!"
Jake says: "This is totally something she would do."
Jake says: "Think about it."
Finn says: "Oh, yeah, okay."
Finn says: "So, wait, the whole kingdom is in on it?"
Jake says: "Yes, and they'll only come out if they think we'll be surprised."
Jake says: "So we got to act like we're totally unaware, okay?"
Finn says: "Okay, man, and how do we do that?"
Jake says: "Just do what I'm doing."
Jake says: "Come on, let's go back to the hut."
Finn says: "The what?"

Jake says: "I don't know."
Jake says: "It didn't take long."
Finn says: "Hm."
Finn says: "So, what should I do now?"
Jake says: "Collect branches for the hobo fire, dude."
Finn says: "Okay."
Jake says: "Ouchies."
Finn says: "A hobo fi-ya, fi-ya, fi-ya."
Finn says: "Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl!"

Jake says: "Just gotta char off the rotten parts—"
Jake says: "good as new, man!"
Jake says: "Stay vigilant."
Jake says: "Eat your protein."
Finn says: "Jake?"
Jake says: "Hmm?"
Finn says: "I'm starting to question your theory about the surprise party."
Jake says: "Don't talk so loud!"
Jake says: "They might hear you!"
Finn says: "What if something happened to them?"
Finn says: "We should try looking around."
Jake says: "Noooo!"
Finn says: "Dude, are you okay?"
Jake says: "Just promise me, Finn."
Jake says: "Promise not to look around."
Finn says: "Okay, I promise."
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "my birthday's gonna be rad."
The stag returns.
Finn says: "Hey, it's you!"
Finn says: "Thanks for breaking my legs, ya dumb-butt!"
The stag licks himself, sniffs the air, and runs away. Finn hears some whispering coming from a nearby manhole. He wheels himself over to it and listens.
Finn says: "That sounds like Candy People!"
Inside the hut, Jake is sleeping. Finn pokes him with a stick.
Finn says: "Jake."
Finn says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "What?"
Finn says: "I heard a sound coming from the sewer!"
Finn says: "We should check it out."
Jake says: "No, man, they'll surprise party me when they're ready."
Jake says: "Be patient."
Finn says: "I'm being patient!"
Finn says: "I waited all day, Jake!"
Jake says: "Well, I've been waiting six months!"
Finn says: "Wait, what are you saying?"
Jake says: "Everything's gonna be fine, even if we have to wait forever."
Finn says: "Have I been asleep for six months?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Yeah, but don't worry about it, man."
A dozen bugs crawl out from underneath his ear and crawl around his body.
Jake says: "Hmm?"
Jake says: "Finn?"
Jake says: "Noooo!"
Jake says: "Don't ruin the surprise!"
Jake runs after Finn, grabs his wheelchair, and sticks his arm into the spokes of the wheel, destroying the chair and flinging Finn forward.
Finn says: "Oh, my Glob!"
The screen goes black and Finn wakes up.
He is tied to a pole, and Jake is tied to a bunch of balloons, weighed down by two cinder blocks.
Jake says: "Surprise!"
Finn says: "Hey, Jake!"
Finn says: "What are you doin'?"
Jake says: "This is how my party's gonna go down."
Jake says: "Shake it, my friends."
Jake says: "Well, we might have some party poopers here, and I want to be sure they don't wipe their buns on my cake."
Finn says: "Can I join your puppet party?"
Finn says: "We'll have twice the puppet voices!"
Jake says: "You won't run away?"
Finn says: "Naw, man, I'm with you."
Finn says: "Happy birthday, Jake."
Finn says: "Really."
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "Glad I can untie you, buddy."
Jake says: "Check it out!"
Jake says: "Finn finally made it to my party!"
Finn says: "And I have a surprise for you!"
Finn says: "Close your eyes and don't open 'em until I tell you."
Jake says: "Finn?"
Jake says: "You lied to me?"
Finn's cast starts cracking.
Finn says: "Yeee-ow!"
Jake says: "What about my party?"
Jake says: "Don't go!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Finn says: "Whup!"
Jake follows, as Finn leaves the water and walks toward the voices.
Finn says: "Hello?"
He opens a door and walks into a room with a sticky caramel-colored substance covering the walls and a whirlpool in the middle of the room. A bit of the substance drips on his forehead. He looks up, seeing Candy People stuck to the walls.
The Candy People whisper and moan.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn..."
Jake says: "Surprise!"
Jake says: "Surprise!"
Jake says: "Suprise!"
Finn says: "You..."
Finn says: "you did this?"
Jake says: "I did this?"
Jake says: "Ow."
Jake says: "They've been waiting for me, Finn, for my b-day!"
Finn says: "Stop being crazy!"
Finn punches him, knocking him against the wall.
Jake says: "Oof."
Jake says: "Yoo-a-hee!"
Jake says: "I'm a woman!"
Jake says: "I'm a woman!"
Finn says: "Mah!"
Jake says: "Ring, ring!"
Jake says: "Baby, I told you never to call me here!"
Finn punches him in the head.
Jake says: "Wha..."
Jake says: "what happened?"
Finn says: "A deer skronked your head and you lost your mind, man!"
Finn says: "You imprisoned the Candy People for your own sick birthday fantasy."
Finn says: "Look."
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "No."
Jake says: "It's not even close to my b-day!"
Jake says: "I'm so sorry."
Peppermint Butler says: "You..."
Peppermint Butler says: "you did not do this, Jake."
Finn says: "Wha—"
Jake says: "Wha—"
Finn says: "?!"
Jake says: "?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Then who did?"
Peppermint Butler says: "It..."
Peppermint Butler says: "was..."
Peppermint Butler says: "him."
The stag stands on his hind legs and walks toward them.
The stag takes off its fake hooves, revealing fingers, which he wiggles.
Jake says: "Freak deer!"
The stag picks up Peppermint Butler.
The stag licks him and sticks him back on the wall.
Finn says: "Grrrr!"
Finn says: "Jake, you free the Candy People."
Finn says: "I'll take on the deer."
Finn says: "Naw-hyah!"
The stag picks up Finn and licks his face. They continue fighting as Jake frees the Candy People.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Thank you."
Jake climbs up to free more as the stag punches Finn below him.
Jake says: "Finn!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
The cinder block lands square on the stag's head. The second block falls after it, squishing the stag's head and knocking it out. The Candy People push the stag into the whirlpool.
Finn says: "Nice!"
Jake says: "Nice!"
Jake says: "We did it, dude!"
Finn says: "How's your noggin?"
Jake says: "Not crazy anymore!"
Jake says: "How's your legs?"
Finn says: "Hmm, still broken."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Thank you for saving my kingdom, boys."
Princess Bubblegum says: "The deer wanted our sugar, but I didn't give him any, if you know what I mean."
Finn says: "Um..."
Finn says: "pyew!"
Finn says: "It's stanky in here!"
Jake says: "Yeah, like bad breath and eggs."
Finn says: "Let's go home so we can get baths."
The Candy People cheer as they form a chain holding onto Jake's legs, who floats out of the manhole.
Candy Person says: "I wanna get clean!"
Episode ends.
