The episode starts with Princess Bubblegum opening the door with a light purplish overlay. She walks outside and is confused by the purplish air.
Princess Bubblegum says: "What the?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Why's it so purple outsi—"
Dust clouds engulf the Candy Kingdom's outer walls. Princess Bubblegum sees the smoke rise.
Princess Bubblegum says: "What?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Pepbut runs in with a telescope. He looks through it and we see smoke rising over the Candy Kingdom.
Peppermint Butler says: "It's too smoky to see..."
A spaceship rises from the smoke.
Peppermint Butler says: "Oh!"
Peppermint Butler says: "Something's peeking."
Peppermint Butler says: "Someone's jacking your spaceship!"
Bubblegum snatches the telescope out of Pepbut's hands and peers though it, tracking the progress of the spaceship.
Princess Bubblegum says: "That is my ship!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "But it looks like it's been modded out."
Princess Bubblegum says: "That much engine power, it'll break through the atmosphere before I can do anything to stop it!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn and Jake!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yeah, get that guy!"
Finn and Jake yell as they rocket through the air. Jake's grip begins to slip, and they fall. Luckily, they are saved when the thorn on Finn's hand catches on a beam.
Finn says: "My thorn!"
Finn says: "I think we should go inside."
Jake busts through the door of the ship with a giant fist. The two slide into a bunch of spacesuits.
Jake says: "Oof!"
Finn opens a hatch, he and Jake now clad in the spacesuits. They climb up a ladder, where they find Gunter at the wheel of the ship.
Finn says: "Gunther!"
Finn says: "What're you doing?!"
Finn says: "!"
Gunter says: "—"
Gunter says: "I emerge!"
Gunter fills up the whole room and the ship is blown to pieces. The forces of the blast causes Finn and Jake to do somersaults in space.
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "You okay?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Yeah, man, just don't croak out here."
Jake says: "Hey, man, look at Gunter."
Orgalorg says: "Behold!"
Jake says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "That's pretty."
Jake says: "Looks good, right?"
Orgalorg says: "Hey."
Orgalorg says: "Where's Glob?"
Finn says: "Uh, I dunno."
Finn says: "He exploded in space."
Orgalorg says: "Yeah, I thought so."
Jake says: "Man, are you still Gunter?"
Jake says: "'Cause you seem like you're not."
Orgalorg says: "I'm Orgalorg."
Finn says: "Well, what the heck are you doing, Orgalorg?"
Orgalorg says: "It was just time to come out again."
Orgalorg says: "Glob K."
Orgalorg says: "O."
Orgalorg says: "'ing himself—"
Orgalorg says: "These are doorways the universe presented to me."
Orgalorg projects a blue, red, and a yellow doorway shape. They merge together to form a purple doorway.
Jake says: "Ohhh, I know about open door philosophy!"
Finn says: "What's that?"
Finn says: "You just say yes to stuff all the time?"
Jake says: "Pretty much."
Finn says: "That seems alright."
Orgalorg says: "It's all yours if you're willing to take it."
Orgalorg says: "Destroy worlds—"
Orgalorg says: "—"
Orgalorg says: "crush anyone blocking the door."
Orgalorg says: "Feel their bones crumple and their goo spill out."
Finn says: "I don't like that at all."
Jake says: "He made it ugly."
Orgalorg says: "You can't stop me; I'm Orgalorg."
Finn says: "I'm pretty sure I can take you, bro."
Orgalorg says: "Not after I absorb the power and knowledge of that comet."
Finn says: "Absorb a triple salchow to your kneecaps!"
Orgalorg pushes off towards the comet, sending Finn and Jake somersaulting and drifting away.
Finn says: "Grab my hand!"
Jake says: "Okay."
They struggle to reach each other, but are drifting too far apart.
Jake says: "Shoot."
Jake says: "Hey, stop drifting!"
Finn says: "I'm not trying to!"
Jake says: "Ooh, maybe I can use jet propulsion!"
Jake says: "Oh no, I can't breathe!"
Finn says: "Jake, no!"
Finn says: "Don't worry, man, I'm working out a plan!"
Finn says: "Freakin' bing-bong!"
Finn says: "Jake's gonna fulfill his croak dream after all!"
Finn says: "And that dirty umbrella is gonna enslave the universe!"
Orgalorg says: "Cram, come on, this is gonna take forever."
Finn says: "Man, I'm gonna croak out here!"
Finn says: "Like a fish in the hands of a child!"
Martin says: "Hey, spaceman."
Martin appears, floating in the giant moth he was seen with in the episode "On the Lam.".
Finn says: "Wha—"
Finn says: "Dad?!"
Finn says: "!"
Martin says: "Heh, this is so crazy, Finn!"
Martin says: "What're you doing out here?"
Finn says: "Floating to my grave!"
Finn says: "Hurry up and save me!"
Martin says: "Can't, buddy—"
Martin says: "—"
Martin says: "this baby does what it wants!"
Finn says: "Are you kidding me?!"
Finn says: "!"
Martin says: "No, for real."
Martin says: "Look!"
Martin says: "Get that guy there!"
The moth doesn't respond.
Martin says: "See?"
Martin says: "I'm just  flying random-style."
Finn says: "It's not random!"
Finn says: "I merged my intention with the universe!"
Martin says: "You what?"
Martin says: "Oh!"
Martin says: "Wait, I have an idea."
Finn says: "Really?"
Martin says: "Here."
Martin says: "Grab on this."
Finn looks at it, frowning.
Martin says: "Nah, it's cool, you got gloves on."
Finn says: "Oh, yeah."
Martin says: "You alright?"
Finn says: "Thanks, universe."
Martin says: "Come again?"
Finn says: "He's out there chokin' on gas!"
Martin says: "We're on a journey into mystery, unless I can figure out what this bozo responds to."
Finn tears up and looks into space.
Martin says: "It's kinda fun, right?"
Martin says: "See, there's no reason, or purpose, or what you said, uh, "universal intention."
Martin says: ""  Look around, Finn."
Martin says: "Empty crud."
Martin says: "So empty."
Finn says: "I dunno, there's some stars and stuff."
Finn says: "Put the phone down?"
Martin says: "Ye—"
Martin says: "WHOO!"
Martin says: "What's going on, huh?"
Finn says: "Look!"
Finn says: "The light of the comet!"
Martin says: "Ah!"
Martin says: "This moth is so bananas, man."
Finn says: "Bananas man..."
Finn says: "bananas man..."
Martin says: "Uh oh, what's that?"
Orgalorg says: "Almost there..."
Finn says: "That dude's gonna absorb the comet's mystical power and crush everybody."
Finn says: "Who the heck raises guys like that?"
Finn says: "You think he had neglectful parents like you, or had he always been a no-good Orgalorg?"
Martin says: "Oh, gobslops, not Orgalorg!"
Finn says: "Y-you know him?"
Martin says: "Yeah, what do you think; I'm a dumb brick?!"
Martin says: "!"
Martin says: "I don't know Orgalorg?"
Orgalorg says: "Ahaha, oh, yeah."
Finn says: "Snaps!"
Finn says: "He ate the comet!"
The moth flies up to Orgalorg and we see the light of the comet inside him.
Finn says: "I gotta stop him."
Martin says: "It's too late, buddy; it's out of our hands."
Finn says: "Scronk that!"
Finn says: "I'm gonna use these hands—"
Finn says: "—"
Finn says: "to sock him in the chops!"
Finn says: "In the chops!"
Finn sails directly into Orgalorg's mouth.
Finn says: "Aahh!"
All goes dark as the flaps of Orgalorg close.
Finn opens his eyes and sees tendrils snaking out of the walls of Orgalorg's insides and stabbing the comet, sucking up its power.
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Dinglord!"
Finn says: "In the name of—"
Finn says: "stop that!"
Two tendrils stab into Finn's right arm to absorb the power of the Grass Sword.
Finn's thorn pulsates and grows into a tentacle, slicing the tendrils off.
Finn says: "Grass Sword."
Finn whips the tentacle at the tendrils absorbing the comet, and also slicing Orgalorg open.
Orgalorg says: "I didn't open this door!"
The tentacle morphs back into an arm shape, still retaining its grassy color and texture.
Finn says: "Cool."
The comet sits, not moving. Cracks begin to appear on it, and it breaks apart to show a round, purple being. It opens its three eyes.
Catalyst Comet says: "Finn, do you remember?"
A sound like a door being opened is heard as Finn closes his eyes and clutches his helmet. A spot on his forehead is glowing.
Finn says: "Yeah, I-I think so."
Finn says: "A long time ago—"
Finn says: "it was just some random, absurd thing."
Finn says: "Just a joke I've been playing out for centuries."
Catalyst Comet says: "Who's creating the joke?"
Catalyst Comet says: "Are you?"
Catalyst Comet says: "And, if so, then are you my creator?"
Finn says: "Uh—"
Finn says: "maybe?"
Finn says: "I dunno."
Finn says: "Probably not."
Catalyst Comet says: "Probably not, but who knows?"
Catalyst Comet says: "I've been around forever and experienced so much impossible junk."
Catalyst Comet says: "I've embodied all that is good—"
Catalyst Comet says: "and evil  Or struggle here awhile like a beautiful autumn leaf."
Finn says: "What's that bell sound?"
Martin says: "Cool, man."
Catalyst Comet says: "This is your crisis."
Catalyst Comet says: "As you stand on the edge of freedom from: Love."
Catalyst Comet says: "Hate."
Catalyst Comet says: "Friendship."
Catalyst Comet says: "Isolation."
Catalyst Comet says: "Jealousy."
Catalyst Comet says: "Secrets."
Catalyst Comet says: "Violence."
Catalyst Comet says: "Video games."
Catalyst Comet says: "Ice cream waffles."
Catalyst Comet says: "Sadness."
Catalyst Comet says: "Madness."
Catalyst Comet says: "Power."
Catalyst Comet says: "Honor."
Catalyst Comet says: "Loyalty."
Catalyst Comet says: "Saucy."
Catalyst Comet says: "Mothers."
Catalyst Comet says: "Fathers."
Catalyst Comet says: "Scoundrels."
As the comet lists things, images of people and objects that represent those things appear in the rainbow.
Finn says: "How long are you gonna list stuff?"
Catalyst Comet says: "It's a long list."
Finn says: "You're tellin' me to abandon all this stuff—"
Finn says: "—"
Finn says: "but you're not really making it sound bad."
Catalyst Comet says: "It's not bad."
Catalyst Comet says: "I'm just giving you the choice of a new mode of existence."
Finn is quiet for a moment as he considers the comet's words.
Finn says: "I feel like I put a lot of work into this meat reality."
Finn says: "I'd like to see it through."
Catalyst Comet says: "Fair enough."
Martin says: "Hey, how 'bout I get a new mode?"
The rainbow flowing from Finn's mind disappears.
Finn says: "Are you seriously trying to bail out again?!"
Finn says: "!"
Martin says: "What?"
Martin says: "This deal sounds pretty good!"
Finn says: "Dad."
Martin says: "Uh oh."
Martin says: "I know that look."
Finn says: "When you fled the scene like a ding-dong ditcher in the night—"
Martin says: "Listen, Finn."
Martin says: "No answer I give you will be satisfying."
Martin says: "Besides, it was, like, 40 years ago."
Finn says: "I'm 16!"
Martin says: "I don't have a star to revolve around to track time."
Finn says: "But why do you always run from everything?!"
Finn says: "!"
Martin says: "You burn enough bridges, the only direction to move is forward."
Finn says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "Well, there ain't no changin' you, I guess."
Martin says: "Well, I'm glad we finally understand each other."
Martin says: "Start the engine, comet boy!"
Catalyst Comet says: "Prepare to discorporate."
Martin, the moth, and the Catalyst Comet disappear into nothing. Immediately after, we hear Martin shout one last thing.
Martin says: "Goodbye, son!"
Finn says: "Bye, Dad."
Finn says: "Should've asked for a lift home."
Jake's spacesuit, which was floating around, bumps into Finn.
Finn says: "JAKE!"
Finn says: "I thought I had lost..."
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "you..."
Finn says: "NO!"
Jake says: "You okay, Finn?"
Jake grins and waves at Finn through the window of the ship.
Finn says: "Jake?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Banana Man?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "How?"
Jake says: "Well, I was just floatin' around, and I drifted into B-Man's flight path."
Jake says: "Pretty random—"
Jake says: "—"
Jake says: "right?"
Finn says: "It wasn't random; I did it."
Jake says: "Let's get the jazz outta here."
The rocket starts to fly back toward Earth, but not before the ripped-up remains of Orgalorg grabs hold of it to hitch a ride home.
Orgalorg says: "No..."
As the ship reenters Earth's atmosphere, Orgalorg's form returns to that of Gunter's.
Peppermint Butler says: "There we go, see?"
Peppermint Butler says: "Problem took care of itself!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "You think Finn and Jake are alright?"
Peppermint Butler says: "I'd say it's about a 50/50 chance."
Princess Bubblegum says: "That's pretty much everything in life, isn't it?"
Peppermint Butler says: "Yeah—"
Peppermint Butler says: "Whoa!"
Peppermint Butler says: "What's that?"
Gunter and the rocket plunge into Lake Butterscotch, soaking Bubblegum and Pepbut in butterscotch. Pepbut catches a fish that splashed out of the lake on impact.
Finn says: "Hey, PB!"
Finn says: "We took care of it."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Good job, guys!"
Fish says: "Mm, I'm gonna croak out here."
Episode Ends.
