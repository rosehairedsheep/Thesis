The episode starts when Finn finishes building Flame Princess' new house, which Flame Princess loves.
Finn says: "Well, looks like your new house is done."
Finn says: "Whoop!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "You wanna check out the new house?"
Jake says: "Naah,  don't let me interrupt you."
Jake says: "You two have fun."
Finn says: "Great!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Finn rises above the surface.
Finn says: "Haha, I'm okay!"
Flame Princess says: "Hmmmm..."
Flame Princess says: "Oh!"
Flame Princess says: "Do the thing that I like."
Jake says: "Now do the thing I like."
Jake says: "Hehehe, classic."
Then Flame Princess returns to her normal humanoid form.
Flame Princess says: "Thank you for building my new home, Finn."
Flame Princess says: "I'm so happy."
Finn says: "You..."
Finn says: "wanna hug?"
Flame Princess says: "Yes."
Both Finn and Flame Princess approached each other and Jake interrupts for a moment.
Jake says: "Woah!"
Jake says: "Hold on "mama."
Then moments later, Jake wraps Finn with FOILED AGAIN tin foil like a burrito.
Jake says: "Okay bro, tin foil's on."
Jake says: "You can hug now."
Both Finn and Flame Princess approached each other again and blushed from back to front. Then Flame Princess hugs Finn and her flames become a little stronger.
Hug ends.
Finn says: "Bye."
Flame Princess says: "Bye, Finn."
Then Finn and Jake leaves.
Moments later.
Jake says: "Looks like your date went pretty good buddy."
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "I don't know, was the hug okay?"
Finn says: "Give me some tips man."
Jake says: "Bro, you gotta let things take their natural path."
Jake says: "Look, look , where you touch her horn for the very first time."
Jake says: "Very special."
Finn says: "What about Tier 15?"
Jake says: "You stay away from that!"
Jake says: "Do not do Tier 15!"
Finn says: "Dude, I got no idea what you're talking about."
Jake says: "Don't worry about it dude, just let things naturally move to Tier 2."
Jake says: "Oh and um, you need a shower dude."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Oh gross."
Later, near the Tree Fort.
Finn says: "Do you think Flame Princess could smell me?"
At the front door.
Jake says: "Probably."
Finn says: "Crup."
Jake opens the front door.
Princess Bubblegum says: "'Sup, guys?"
Finn says: "Princess Bubblegum?!"
Jake says: "Princess Bubblegum?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "What are you doing here?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Collecting taxes, you guys weren't home."
Princess Bubblegum says: "So I let myself in."
Jake says: "Oh."
Finn says: "I'm gonna take a shower."
Finn says: "Princess, do not inhale!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "What?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Why?"
Finn says: "Just don't."
Finn says: "Hyap!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "What's that all about?"
Jake says: "Aah, he's just smelly from a day of running around with his lady-friend."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Ooh, a lady-friend, do tell."
Jake says: "Uh, I shouldn't say."
Jake says: "It's his business."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, come on, you can tell me."
Jake says: "That's his personal biz, you gotta respect the man's p-biz."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Okay, you're right, I'll respect it."
Suddenly Jake reveals in an outburst.
Jake says: "Flame Princess!"
Jake says: "He's hanging out with Flame Princess!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "What?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Jake says: "And I don't mean to be telling stories out of school."
Jake says: "But pretty soon,  they're gonna be taking it to Tier 2."
Princess Bubblegum says: "No, this isn't possible."
Jake says: "Oh, it's possible."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I just never thought, Flame Princess."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I-uh-I have to go."
Moments later, outside the Tree Fort.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Morrow!"
Inside the Tree Fort.
Jake says: "Mmm, weird."
Jake says: "President Porpoise!"
Later at Princess Bubblegum's bedroom.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh gob, I thought I'd be ready for this."
The next day.
Jake pulls out the contents out of the sack which was Princess Bubblegum's taxes to collect.
Finn says: "Yyyaawn!"
Suddenly Princess Bubblegum was standing in the doorway.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "Ok Princess, you need to stop breaking in here."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I have something important to tell you."
Princess Bubblegum says: "About relationships."
Finn says: "Ah, that's okay, Princess."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I just hope, you'll understand."
Princess Bubblegum says: "are like layers of sedimentary rock..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "."
Finn says: "Jake, Flame Princess is waiting for me."
Finn says: "I'm gonna bounce out."
Jake says: "Uh, ok,  Tier 2 baby!"
Finn says: "Word."
Jake turns around and sees more boring stuff.
Princess Bubblegum says: "If too much frustration builds, the magma will erupt causing a catastrophic super-stratum of igneous rock to form..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "..."
Then Jake falls asleep and starts daydreaming.
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "Where am I?"
Mini-snowman says: "Jake, you're president now!"
The Mini-snowman and the other 2 animals clap for Jake being the new president.
Jake says: "Oh my glosh!"
Princess Bubblegum tries to wake up Jake.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Jake!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Wake up!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Jake, where's Finn?"
Jake says: "He stepped out."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Will you tell him why he can't see Flame Princess anymore?"
Jake says: "Oh, oh!"
Jake says: "I see what's going on here!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Great!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I cannot stress how important it is that they not see each other."
Jake says: "Oh man, PB is totally jealous of Flame Princess!"
Several hours later, Finn returns home.
Moments later, inside the Tree Fort, Jake is playing with BMO.
BMO says: "Jump, punch, kick, kick!"
Jake says: "What's up man?"
Finn says: "Yo, dude!"
Finn says: "So what did Princess Bubblegum want?"
Jake says: "She doesn't want you see Flame Princess anymore."
Jake says: "She's crazy jealous!"
Jake says: "So, you at Tier 2 yet?"
Finn says: "I got about five hugs, does that count?"
Jake says: "Nnoope."
Finn says: "Uhaah.."
Finn says: "Well, I'm still at Tier 1."
Jake says: "I know exactly what'll get you Tier 2..."
Jake says: "."
Jake says: "A "sappy poem."
Moments later, at their bedroom.
Jake says: "Say something about her "spectrum."
Finn says: "Ee-eww!"
Finn says: "Let's see..."
Finn says: "."
Finn says: "She's bright."
Finn says: "She's beautiful."
Finn says: "She makes me feel..."
Finn says: "confused, l-like something's filling up my chest, like I can't breathe, is it because she's so.."
Finn says: "dangerous?"
Finn says: "Glob, Jake, I can't stand it!"
Then the sun rises and Finn looks at it for an idea.
Later outside, Finn sits near a tree facing the rising sun making a poem.
Finn says: "Inspiration..."
Princess Bubblegum suddenly appears nearby.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Whatcha doin'?"
Finn says: "Oh, uh, hi, Princess."
Finn says: "I'm, uhh, writing something for Jake."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, well, speaking of Jake."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Did he explain everything to you?"
Finn says: "Yyeah."
Princess Bubblegum says: "And you understand?"
Finn says: "Yeah, I understand."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn, sometimes you want someone and you  want to kiss them, and be with them."
Princess Bubblegum says: "But you can't, because responsibility demands sacrifice."
Finn says: "What are you trying to say?!"
Finn says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'm trying to say that you're a hero, Finn."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You're my hero."
Princess Bubblegum says: "So, I'm glad you understand why you can't be with Flame Princess."
Finn says: "Grr..."
Finn says: "Bubblegum!"
Finn says: "I can't do this anymore!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "What?"
Finn says: "Now you like me?!"
Finn says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn, what are you talking about?"
Finn says: "What am I talking about?!"
Finn says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, no!"
Later at the Tree Fort, Jake is making and singing "Bacon Pancakes".
Then Princess Bubblegum appears climbing up a ladder.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Jake, where's Finn?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Is he with Flame Princess?"
Jake says: "Back off, Bubblegum!"
Jake says: "That's his "man's biz."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Is he with her?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Or not?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "What are you.."
Princess Bubblegum says: "?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "This isn't about some  Her elemental matrix can't handle extreme romance!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Glob, if Finn tries to kiss her, she'll burn so hot, she'll melt right through the planet's crust, down through the molten core, then she'll be thrown back and forth by gravity until she burns out the world from the inside!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Why do you think I had her father keep her locked up?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Will you take me to them?"
Jake turns around, shuts the burner, grabs Princess Bubblegum, grows huge, breaks the wall, and makes a run for it.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Faster!"
Later, near Flame Princess's house.
Flame Princess says: "Ahhh."
Then Finn and Flame Princess lean in to kiss each other.
Princess Bubblegum says: "No!"
Finn and Flame Princess kiss for the very first time, followed by a bright light from the instability of Flame Princess's elemental matrix, which throws Finn to the ground.
Flame Princess continues to melt and fall through the Earth's crust.
Finn says: "FLAME PRINCESS!"
Jake says: "Finn!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn, there's no time!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "You have to..."
Jake says: "Are you alright?"
Finn grabs Jake's right arm, ties it around himself, and jumps into the hole after Flame Princess.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn!"
Finn says: "Ohhh-tsst."
Finn says: "Flame Princess!"
Jake says: "It's hot!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Wait, wait!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Don't move."
Princess Bubblegum says: "This is good!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "If you stay on the hole for 24."
Princess Bubblegum says: "8 seconds, the reaction will be deprived of oxygen."
Princess Bubblegum says: "She'll go out."
Jake says: "Geh.."
Jake says: "What about Finn?"
At the bottom of the hole.
Finn says: "Hey!"
Flame Princess burns again and regains consciousness.
Finn loses consciousness, with added burns to the right side of his face.
Flame Princess says: "Huh, ummm."
Jake pulls out both Finn and Flame Princess successfully.
Finn says: "Are you okay?"
Flame Princess says: "I'm okay."
Flame Princess says: "I'm okay."
Princess Bubblegum struggles to get out of Jake's weight and gets a relief.
Princess Bubblegum says: "She's stabilized."
Princess Bubblegum says: "We're safe..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "for now."
Then Finn discovers another way of kissing Flame Princess without getting hurt.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, Finn."
She turns around and sees Jake staring at her with a grin.
Princess Bubblegum says: "What?"
Jake says: "Jeeeaalous?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Shut up."
The episode ends.
