The scene opens to the Hot Dog Kingdom, where Finn and Jake stare at the stars while two Hot Dog Knights play in the mud besides Hot Dog Princess.
Jake says: "Dude!"
Jake says: "Shooting star!"
Jake says: "Make a wish!"
A small glowing orb hovers slowly towards Finn and Jake.
Finn says: "It's just a firefly."
Finn kisses the firefly, leaving a glowing stain around his mouth, and releases it.
Finn says: "What are you gonna wish for dude?"
Jake says: "Oh, you know."
Jake says: "That something special only two bros can share."
Finn says: "I think I'm wishing for the same thing!"
Jake says: "You mean the..."
Finn says: "Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant!"
Jake says: "Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant!"
They imagine themselves riding said War Elephant, which hovers, spins and shoot lasers out of its trunks.
Jake says: "Oh, man I wanna ride it so bad!"
Finn says: "How do you even control those things?"
Jake says: "You can't control it dude."
Jake says: "You have to let it give you control."
Finn says: "Oh wow!"
A firework flies up in the distance, Finn and Jake notice it.
Jake says: "Start wishin'!"
The firework explodes, spelling out B.U.T.T. in the sky.
Finn says: "What the..."
Hot Dog Princess says: "Hot Dog Knights are slow."
Finn, Jake and Hot Dog Princess looks towards the two Hot Dog Knights, who are playing in the mud guffawing dumbly.
Finn says: "Don't worry, princess."
Finn says: "Jake and I are on it."
The scene changes to Finn and Jake standing on a hill, overlooking the labyrinth. The labyrinth is huge, its walls adorned with eyes.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Fudge, man!"
Finn says: "This place is yoga balls huge!"
Jake says: "Yoga balls aren't that really huge, dude."
Finn says: "Hey, man, I can't analyze everything that comes out of my mouth."
They approach the entrance to the labyrinth.
Jake says: "Should we like, try to cheat and stretch over the walls?"
Finn says: "Nah, man."
Finn says: "Look."
Finn points to a sign which text changes from mathematical equations to a warning saying "NO CHEATING OR YOU DIE.".
Jake says: "Okay, well..."
Jake says: "then..."
Jake says: "I'll just hook my legs around this stump and stretch us through so we don't get lost."
Jake says: "Like this, see?"
Finn says: "You're a cool guy, Jake."
Jake says: "Thank you."
They enter the labyrinth, Jake stretching his body as Finn walks.
Finn says: "Man, there're so many passage ways and stuff."
Finn says: "It'll take us forever to find those Hot Dog Kni-iights?"
The four Hot Dog Knights are right in front of them. The knights see the adventurers and scream, run around and all fall over.
Hot Dog Knight #1 says: "Don't eat me, man!"
Jake says: "Nah, we're here to save you, guy!"
Hot Dog Knight #2 says: "Oh, thank the stars."
Hot Dog Knight #2 says: "We were lost!"
Hot Dog Knight #3 says: "How didn't you guys get lost?"
Finn says: "We're just gonna follow Jake's body back."
The Hot Dog Knights cheer. "Whoa!" "Far out!" "Look at that!".
Hot Dog Knight #1 says: "At the centre of the maze, there's a magic creature that grants wishes."
Finn says: "Wishes?"
Finn says: "Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Finn says: "Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant!"
Jake says: "Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant!"
Jake says: "This is our chance!"
Hot Dog Knights says: "Hot dog!"
Jake says: "Hold on boys, we're gonna get us some wishes!"
The Hot Dog Knights cheer.
Jake says: "Choo-choo."
The scene cuts to Finn and Jake, with the Hot Dog Knights, traversing the labyrinth. On the other sides of the walls, creatures made of ice and snakes are present. Finn and Jake sing "Sing 'Cause Yo Mama Said.".
Finn says: "Dang, Jake."
Finn says: "Your body's getting thin!"
Jake says: "Yeah, I got a nice bod!"
Finn says: "Yeah, but now..."
Finn says: "not so nice."
Jake says: "Okay, well you can take your weird body issues and tuck them somewhere private."
Jake says: "Where I can take my healthy body issues..."
Jake says: "and  FIGHT A GOLEM!"
The golem punches at the adventurers. Jake dodges, flinging the Hot Dog Knights of his body, and Finn is knocked over.
Golem says: "TRESPASSERS!"
Finn covers the golem's eyes with his shirt.
Finn says: "Wrap 'im up, Jake!"
Jake says: "I'm on it!"
Jake says: "Stop flexing."
Jake says: "I can't..."
Jake says: "stretch..."
Jake says: "."
Jake says: "any more."
Hot Dog Knight #2 says: "You can do it, Jake!"
Hot Dog Knight #2 says: "Stretch stretch stretch!"
Hot Dog Knight #2 says: "Wrap him up more!"
Jake, empowered by the encouragement, stretches fully around the golem.
Jake says: "Come on baby."
Jake strains in agony as he pulls his body, toppling the golem. The Hot Dog Knights cheer as Jake stretches over to Finn, exhausted.
Jake says: "Golem..."
Jake says: "taken care of..."
Jake says: "dudes."
Hot Dog Knight #1 says: "Jake, you're amazing."
The Hot Dog Knights cheer and jump on Jake's back.
Finn says: "Jake, you need to take it easy on the stretching, man."
Hot Dog Knight #2 says: "Wha..."
Hot Dog Knight #2 says: "n-no Jake, you can keep going, man."
Hot Dog Knight #2 says: "Right guys?"
Hot Dog Knight #2 says: "Come on, Jake, you can go!"
Hot Dog Knights says: "Jake!"
Hot Dog Knights says: "Jake!"
Hot Dog Knights says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "Alright."
Jake says: "Come on, Finn."
Jake says: "The stretching train is leaving the station."
Jake says: "Choo-choo."
Jake stretches past Finn while he thinks to himself worriedly. The scene changes to them running through the labyrinth's passages. Jake is still struggling.
Jake says: "Just gotta keep stretchin'."
Finn says: "Uh, yeah."
Finn says: "Wait!"
Finn says: "Stop, Jake."
Finn says: "Ya hear that?"
Jake says: "No."
Finn says: "This place is weirding me out."
Finn says: "Keep your eyes open for traps and junk."
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Check that out!"
Jake points to his stretched body before them, showing that they have gone in a circle.
Finn says: "Oh, snap!"
Finn says: "That's you dude."
Jake says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "Boop."
Jake says: "Hey, man."
Jake says: "Watch it."
Jake says: "I think that's my nerp, but like super stretched out."
Finn says: "Boop boop."
Finn says: "Boop boop boop boop boop."
Jake says: "Stop man!"
Jake continues laughing as a sinister looking scorpion lands on his 'nerp' and viciously stabs him with its stinger.
Jake says: "NERP!"
Jake punches the scorpion as many more fall out of three holes in the labyrinth wall. The scorpions start stinging the Hot Dog Knights.
Finn says: "Oh my Grob!"
Hot Dog Knight #1 says: "It's okay, hot dogs are immune to poison."
More scorpions pour from the holes.
Finn says: "Sick!"
Jake says: "I got it!"
Jake says: "Owowowowowowowowow."
Hot Dog Knights says: "Jake!"
Hot Dog Knights says: "Jake!"
Hot Dog Knights says: "Jake!"
Hot Dog Knights says: "No Jake no!"
Hot Dog Knight #4 says: "Work through the pain!"
Hot Dog Knight #4 says: "Let's get wishes!"
Hot Dog Knights says: "Wishes!"
Jake says: "Let's do it."
Finn says: "I don't think this is a good idea, man."
Jake says: "I'm fine, brother."
Jake says: "We'll have that war elephant in no time!"
Finn says: "Ah, uh, okay..."
The scene changes to a montage of Finn, Jake and the Hot Dog Knights accomplishing tasks in the maze, in some places Jake stretching his body unnecessarily. At the end they come through a door.
Finn says: "Hmm, looks like the final puzzle."
Finn says: "You think you can stretch up there, buddy."
Jake is heavily stretched, his eyes almost popping out of their sockets.
Jake says: "Yes."
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Jake, you okay?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Huh, yeah, I just..."
Jake says: "can't close my eyes..."
Jake says: "lids..."
Jake says: "too tight."
Finn says: "Okay, dude this is too far!"
Finn says: "No more maze, we're going home."
Jake says: "Yeah..."
Jake says: "I'm feeling a little thin."
Hot Dog Knights says: "No!"
Hot Dog Knights says: "Don't stop!"
Hot Dog Knights says: "Keep stretching!"
Hot Dog Knight #2 says: "You stretch good!"
Hot Dog Knights says: "Jake!"
Hot Dog Knights says: "Jake!"
Hot Dog Knights says: "Jake!"
Hot Dog Knights says: "Woohoo!"
Jake says: "Ah, alright."
Finn says: "Jake, no!"
Finn says: "You're gonna get hurt."
The Hot Dog Knights keep cheering for Jake to go.
Jake says: "I'm goin' for it!"
Finn says: "Jake, no!"
Jake, groaning in agony, solves the sliding puzzle, which turns out to be a cat.
Jake says: "Done!"
A door in the statues groin area opens, revealing a podium with an orange glowing orb above.
Finn says: "That must be the wishes!"
Hot Dog Knights 1, 3 and 4 cheer as the second looks at the sliding puzzle.
Hot Dog Knight #2 says: "Kitty!"
As Jake stretches down, the second Hot Dog Knight leaps a top the sliding puzzle.
Finn says: "You did it, man."
Finn says: "No we can go wish for a..."
Finn says: "Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant."
Jake says: "Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant."
They go through the door, leavind the second Hot Dog Knight.
Jake says: "Gotta move carefully."
Jake says: "My internal organs are super stretched, I'm paper thin!"
Hot Dog Knight #2 says: "I love kitties!"
The Hot Dog Knight jumps up and down on the sliding puzzle, causing it to fall and shatter. The statue's mouth flashes as the door begins to close. The adventurers through the door turn in confusion.
Hot Dog Knight #2 says: "I am sorry!"
The door closes on Jake's incredibly thin body, crushing it. He falls in intense agony.
Jake says: "Ow!"
Jake says: "Ooh!"
Jake says: "My insides are all mashes up!"
Finn says: "I knew we should have turned back!"
Jake says: "You were right."
Jake says: "I pushed myself too far."
Jake says: "I'll never fall victim to peer pressure again!"
Hot Dog Knight #4 says: "No!"
Hot Dog Knight #4 says: "Jake!"
Hot Dog Knight #4 says: "Jake!"
Hot Dog Knight #4 says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "Actually, I'll do anything you guys want if you say my name three times."
Finn says: "Just hang tight, buddy."
Finn says: "I'll use my wish to save you."
Aquandrius says: "Congratulations, warriors."
Aquandrius says: "Step forward, and take your wishes."
Hot Dog Knight #1 says: "Ah!"
Hot Dog Knight #1 says: "I'm gonna wish for a hat!"
Hot Dog Knight #1 says: "Woohoo."
The Hot Dog Knight charges forwards excitedly, steps on a pressure plate and is splattered to pieces by a cannon ball.
Finn and the remaining two Hot Dog Knights gasp and scream in shock.
Aquandrius says: "Who's next?"
Hot Dog Knight #3 says: "Nuh-uh, that floor got traps!"
Hot Dog Knight #4 says: "Jake!"
Hot Dog Knight #4 says: "Jake!"
Hot Dog Knight #4 says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "Here we go!"
Jake says: "Ooh."
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "Jake is all jacked up."
Hot Dog Knight #3 says: "Then how else can we get wishes?!"
Hot Dog Knight #3 says: "!"
Finn looks around for inspiration, and then to Jake, who groans.
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Get up and carry us across!"
Jake says: "But I'm too weak!"
Finn and the Hot Dog Knights begins chanting Jake's name. He shouts in determination and wraps his thin arms around Finn, who holds the knights, stretching them over the pressure plates to the podium. Finn shouts his name one last time.
Jake says: "Yeaargh!"
Jake says: "That's it, I'm dead."
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Stay with me, man!"
Jake says: "Nah."
Finn says: "But we did it, okay!"
Finn says: "I can wish you out of here, man!"
Aquandrius says: "Oh yes, now you may each receive your wishes."
Aquandrius says: "For real!"
Aquandrius says: "But be warned."
Aquandrius says: "There are no do overs!"
Finn says: "Okay,  So you guys should wish to get your buddies back, right?"
Hot Dog Knight #4 says: "I wish for a box!"
Hot Dog Knight #4 says: "Sweet!"
Hot Dog Knight #3 says: "And I wish to blow up!"
Hot Dog Knight #3 says: "I mean like get big!"
Finn says: "Wow, you guys are really stupid."
Hot Dog Knight #4 says: "What do you mean?"
Aquandrius says: "Dog, you're next!"
Aquandrius says: "What do you wish?"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Wish for the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant!"
Finn says: "Then I'll wish to save you!"
Jake says: "Right."
Jake says: "So hard to think on an empty stomach."
Jake says: "I wish I wasn't so hungry."
Finn says: "You wasted your wish, man!"
Jake says: "I know."
Jake says: "You should wish for the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant."
Jake says: "It's what we wanted."
Finn says: "That's crazy, man!"
Finn says: "I gotta save your life."
Jake says: "Do it..."
Jake says: "for..."
Jake says: "me!"
Finn says: "I..."
Finn says: "wish..."
Finn says: "for..."
Finn says: "the Ancient PSYCHIC TANDEM WAR ELEPHANT!"
Jake says: "Yes!"
Aquandrius says: "Your wish is granted."
Finn's orb transforms into the elephant, Finn gasps as it spins, trumpets and shoots lasers around.
Jake says: "It has to give you control!"
Jake says: "Remember!"
Finn says: "I'm on it."
Finn says: "Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant."
Finn says: "HEAR ME!"
The elephant's pupils contract.
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant says: "Finn the Human!"
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant says: "Are you worthy to command me?"
Finn says: "Now wish for my friends to be healed!"
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant says: "I wish..."
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant says: "for what Finn..."
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant says: "desires."
Jake and the four Hot Dog Knights appear on the elephants back.
Jake says: "Yeah, boyyy!"
Aquandrius says: "No!"
Aquandrius says: "You weren't supposed to have your wishes come true!"
Aquandrius says: "You were supposed to die!"
Finn says: "Now, bust us outta here!"
The elephant flies away, leaving Aquandrius in his defeat.
Aquandrius says: "No!"
Finn says: "Yeah, boyyy!"
Finn and Jake chuckles as they all travel into the moonlight. The episode ends.
