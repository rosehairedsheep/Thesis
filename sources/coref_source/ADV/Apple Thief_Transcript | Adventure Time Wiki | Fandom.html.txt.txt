The episode begins in the Tree Fort's kitchen, where Jake is preparing a meal.
Jake says: "Finn, lunch is ready!"
Finn says: "Ugh, what are you cooking?"
Jake says: "It's good!"
Jake says: "I learned it from Rainicorn."
Finn says: "I'm not eatin' that."
Finn says: "It smells funny."
Jake says: "Dude, this took me, like—"
Finn says: "Let's go over to Tree Trunks's and get some apple pie!"
Finn says: "Apple pie!"
Finn says: "Apple Pie!"
Finn says: "Apple Pie!"
Finn says: "Apple Pie!"
Finn says: "Apple Pie!"
Finn says: "Let's go!"
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Eh."
Scene changes to Tree Trunks' house.
Tree Trunks is lying on the floor next to a broken table, motionless.
Finn says: "Tree Trunks!"
Finn says: "Tree Trunks?"
Tree Trunks says: "Apples..."
Tree Trunks says: "my apples..."
Jake says: "Apples?"
Tree Trunks says: "You!"
Finn says: "Whoa, whoa!"
Finn says: "Tree Trunks, it's us, Finn and Jake!"
Tree Trunks says: "Finn..."
Tree Trunks says: "and, and Jake?"
Finn says: "It's okay, Tree Trunks."
Finn says: "We're here to help you."
Finn says: "Just tell us what happened."
Tree Trunks says: "They took 'em."
Tree Trunks says: "They took all of 'em."
Jake says: "All of what?"
Tree Trunks says: "Apples."
Tree Trunks says: "My apples that I raised with love from, from mere seedlings."
Tree Trunks says: "Without my special apples, I won't be able to bake any more apple pies."
Finn says: "NOOOOOOOO!"
Jake says: "NOOOOOOOO!"
Finn says: "Don't you worry, Tree Trunks."
Finn says: "We'll find those thieves and bring them to justice."
Tree Trunks says: "Let me show you the crime scene."
Tree Trunks says: "You see, boys: scads of apple trees but, but no apples."
Finn says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "Is anything else missing, Tree Trunks?"
Tree Trunks says: "No, Finn, they didn't touch my rocks, or my birds, or my flowers, or, or nothing."
Finn says: "Hm."
Finn says: "Well, I don't see any footprints."
Finn says: "What'cha got, Jake?"
Jake says: "Oh, no."
Jake says: "No."
Finn says: "Hm."
Finn says: "Tree Trunks, is there anyone you can think of who might want to crunk you up?"
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, no, Finn."
Tree Trunks says: "I take great care to assure that-that I'm loved by even the most heinous cretins—"
Jake says: "Hey, guys, I found something!"
Jake says: "Look!"
Finn and Tree Trunks join Jake at the edge of a hole.
Tree Trunks says: "Uh!"
Raggedy Princess says: "Oh, heheh, hey, Finn."
Raggedy Princess says: "Heheh."
Finn says: "Oh, hey, Raggedy Princess."
Finn says: "Have you seen anything fishy going on?"
Raggedy Princess says: "Um, no, heheh."
Raggedy Princess says: "I've been kinda down in this hole for a long time."
Raggedy Princess says: "I got knocked down here by some ne'er-do-wells."
Raggedy Princess says: "It was terrible."
Raggedy Princess says: "I was so scared."
Tree Trunks says: "Ne'er-do-wells?"
Tree Trunks says: "They stole my apples."
Tree Trunks says: "I'm gonna sass those boys up nasty!"
Finn says: "Awesome."
Finn says: "Where do we find these guys?"
Jake says: "Oh, the Candy Tavern, man."
Jake says: "I used to hang out there back when I used to snatch old ladies' purses."
Jake says: "Don't worry, I stopped doing that a long time ago."
Jake says: "I didn't know it was wrong."
Tree Trunks says: "Okay, you two, let's get going."
Scene changes to outside the Candy Tavern. Someone gets thrown out of the window.
Candy Tavern Person says: "Whoa!"
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, my!"
The three enter the tavern. A Candy Person at the bar repeatedly stabs his hand with a spoon, and an angry cookie shakes.
Finn says: "Uh, does Princess Bubblegum know about this place?"
Jake says: "Be cool, man."
Jake says: "You're gonna queer the deal."
Finn says: "Oh, yeah."
Finn says: "Try not to act suspicious, Tree Trunks."
Tree Trunks says: "Okay, I won't."
The three walk up to the Candy Tavern Bartender.
Finn says: "Where—"
Tree Trunks says: "Where—"
Finn says: "?"
Tree Trunks says: "?"
Finn says: "Oh."
Tree Trunks says: "Where's my dang apples?"
Finn says: "Oh,  Tree Trunks, you're so silly."
Finn says: "But, but listen, you wouldn't happen to have seen any—"
Finn says: "I don't know—"
Finn says: "apples around, have you?"
Bartender says: ""Seen any apples?"
Bartender says: "" Y'all ask a lot of dumb-butt questions..."
Bartender says: "almost like you're trying to solve somethin'."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no."
Bartender says: "Mmm..."
Bartender says: "clean, too."
Bartender says: "Almost like some  do-gooders!"
Jake says: "Hold on, we gotta go potty."
The three enter the bathroom and rub dirt all over their bodies.
Finn says: "Dang."
Finn says: "They almost got us, but I think we blend in pretty well now."
Tree Trunks says: "This, this toilet paper's drying my mouth all up."
Finn says: "Uh, Tree Trunks, don't eat that."
Finn says: "You gotta watch her, man!"
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, I look just like an army brat!"
The three return to the bartender.
Bartender says: "What can I do for you?"
Bartender says: "Well, when you put it like that..."
Bartender says: "."
Bartender says: "A couple of buddies I know have some apples for sale."
Bartender says: "I'll show you."
He leads them to a back door and opens it to a tall gingerbread man and an upside-down ice cream cone.
Bartender says: "Hey, fellas, these folks been askin' 'bout your..."
Bartender says: "apples?"
Jaybird says: "Okay, show 'em the apples, Smudge."
Smudge picks up a trash can and puts it over Jake.
Jaybird says: "Grab 'em!"
The bartender grabs Finn and Tree Trunks.
Jaybird says: "You go back, and you tell your boss to stop looking for those apples 'cause they're ours now!"
Finn says: "Wha-what boss?"
Jaybird says: "Your boss!"
Jaybird says: "Dr."
Jaybird says: "J?"
Finn says: "We don't know any Dr."
Finn says: "J."
Jaybird says: "..."
Jaybird says: "gonna take my apples."
The bartender drops Finn and Tree Trunks and closes the door. Jake takes the trash can off.
Jake says: "What just happened?"
Finn says: "I guess these guys who stole Tree Trunks' apples also stole Dr."
Finn says: "J's apples, and they thought we were workin' for him!"
Tree Trunks says: "Finn?"
Tree Trunks says: "Finn."
Finn says: "Hm?"
Tree Trunks says: "This could be dangerous, a-and if you want to go back home, I understand, but I need to do this."
Finn says: "Yeah, Tree Trunks, me too."
Jake says: "Hey, Finn."
Finn says: "Hm?"
Jake says: "What's that on your face, buddy?"
Finn says: "Oh, that guy bopped me one."
Finn says: "Must've had a ring on."
Jake says: "Y'know, I think I seen that symbol somewhere before."
Jake says: "Yeah, right next door to where I used to hawk stolen bikes."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "I didn't know it was wrong."
Scene changes to the outskirts of the Candy Kingdom.
Jake says: "Yeah, you see?"
Jake says: "That guy must work here or somethin'."
The three walk up to the building.
Finn says: "Hello?"
Wormo says: "Who's the heck happening?"
Wormo says: "What?"
Finn says: "Uh, we're here about the apples?"
Wormo says: "Oh, okay."
Wormo says: "Let's see your ring."
Finn says: "Um..."
Jake says: "Here."
Before the door closes, someone stops it with their foot.
Finn says: "What the?"
Wormo says: "What's wrong, guy?"
Finn says: "These aren't apples."
Wormo says: "Oh, ya didn't mean diamonds?"
Wormo says: "All ne'er-do-wells call diamonds "apples."
Wormo says: "" Like calling money "bread" or rock-knockers "butter-slaps."
Jaybird says: "What are they doing here?"
Wormo says: "They're here for the apples."
Jaybird says: "That's the dang Dr."
Jaybird says: "J gang, Wormo!"
Jaybird says: "Grab 'em!"
Finn, Jake, and Tree Trunks are tied up.
Tree Trunks says: "Um, sir?"
Tree Trunks says: "I promise if you let us go, we won't tell no one about your apples."
Wormo says: "Feed 'em to the pig."
Smudge says: "Yeah, the pig."
Jaybird says: "Heheh, yeah, all right."
Mr. Pig says: "Uh, I'm sorry, y'all."
Mr. Pig says: "They're makin' me do this."
Mr. Pig says: "I-I'll try to make it quick."
Dr. J says: "Hold it!"
Dr. J and his gang appear.
Jaybird says: "Dr."
Jaybird says: "J!"
Dr. J says: "Yeah, yeah, and I want my apples back."
Jaybird says: "Get 'em, boys!"
Dr. J says: "Get 'em, boys!"
While the gangs fight, Finn, Jake, and Tree Trunks free themselves from the rope, and Jake brings the pig with them to Tree Trunks' house.
Finn says: "Aw, don't cry, Tree Trunks."
Tree Trunks says: "But we're never gonna find those apples."
Mr. Pig says: "Apples?"
Mr. Pig says: "You guys looking for apples?"
Jake says: "Uh, yeah, why?"
Mr. Pig says: "'Cause I can hear a bunch of apples in this room."
Jake says: "Wait, you mean "apples" as "diamonds"?"
Mr. Pig says: "No."
Jake says: ""Apples" as "apples"?"
Mr. Pig says: "Yep."
Finn says: "You mean apples that we eat?"
Mr. Pig says: "Yes."
Tree Trunks says: "With all due respect, Mr."
Tree Trunks says: "Pig, sir, my apples were stolen by a dirty, rotten criminal who needs to be put in jail."
Mr. Pig says: "I'm just telling you the facts, ma'am."
Mr. Pig says: "What I hear is a whole pigload of apples inside that closet."
Mr. Pig says: "They sound scared."
Tree Trunks says: "Well, I hate to tell you this, boys, but there's no apples in this closet."
Dozens of apples spill out.
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, so I was the apple thief after all."
Finn says: "No, Tree Trunks, that's preposterous."
Tree Trunks says: "No, Finn, I'm a criminal,  and I need to pay the price."
Banana Guard says: "Banana Guard speaking."
Tree Trunks says: "Uh, this is Tree Trunks."
Tree Trunks says: "I've done somethin' horrible, and I want you to come over and arrest me."
Finn and Jake exchange sad looks.
Scene changes to outside the house, with Tree Trunks in handcuffs and two Banana Guards standing by.
Finn says: "Tree Trunks, you don't need to do this."
Tree Trunks says: "Thank you, Finn and Jake, but I won't let myself slip away from such a terrible crime."
Tree Trunks says: "Goodbye."
Finn says: "Tree Trunks."
Banana Guard says: "Ah, this is hard to watch."
Banana Guard says: "I'm gonna look away."
Several crows fly out of the forest.
Banana Guard says: "This place could use a scarecrow."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Wait, what'd you say?"
Banana Guard says: "Uh, I-I said this place could use a scarecrow."
Finn says: "A scarecrow, no footprints, all those magpies on the roof, Raggedy Princess in the ditch, and all the apples in Tree Trunks's closet."
Banana Guard says: "Boy, this place could use a scarecrow."
Finn says: "That's it!"
Finn says: "I knew it!"
A nest is next to a hole in the roof. A magpie brings an apple to its chicks, but the apple falls into the hole.
Finn says: "The magpies have been stealing the apples and accidentally dropping them in this hole!"
Jake says: "And that's why there weren't any footprints around the tree!"
Finn says: "Yes."
Finn says: "And the magpies were able to steal the apples because Raggedy Princess wasn't sitting on the fence post to scare them off!"
Tree Trunks says: "Does this mean I'm innocent?"
Jake says: "As innocent as a baby's butt cheek!"
Finn says: "Awesome!"
Finn says: "This calls for a celebration!"
Finn says: "You know what that means, Tree Trunks!"
Tree Trunks says: "I'ma bake you the biggest and the tastiest apple pie you boys ever tasted."
Banana Guards says: "Whoa."
Banana Guard says: "She slapped my butt!"
The other Banana Guard gives a thumbs up.
The others join in.
Episode ends.
