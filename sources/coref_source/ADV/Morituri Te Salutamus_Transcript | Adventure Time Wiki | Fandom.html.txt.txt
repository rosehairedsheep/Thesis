The scene opens to a craggy wasteland. Finn and Jake are bouncing away from a Burger Monster. Jake hits the side of a rugged rock, and Finn goes flying off. He lands. Both Finn and Jake are carrying something in their shirt or folds.
Finn says: "Jake, why didn't you stick to the plan?"
Jake says: "Psshh."
Jake says: "Hey, you wanna bump baby lumps?"
Finn says: "Sick."
Finn says: "No."
Finn says: "Just try to follow the plans, okay?"
Jake says: "Yeah."
Finn and Jake drop what they are carrying, which turns out to be small balls of spikes.
Finn says: "Come on out, cuties."
Finn says: "It's safe now."
The creatures look up. They are young hedgehogs.
Jake says: "Now get out of here."
Suddenly, a noise that sounds like a battle catches Finn's ear.
Finn says: "Hey, you hear something?"
Finn says: "Up there."
Jake says: "Eh, it's probably just puberty calling."
Finn and Jake walk to the entrance. They pause as a glowing green aura flashes in front of the doorway. Finn and Jake look up to see a mummy-like creature on a high throne.
Fight King says: "Fighters!"
Fight King says: "Fighters!"
Fight King says: "Seek you glory from the Fight King?"
Finn says: "Mmmm..."
Finn says: "Maybe."
Fight King says: "Then step forth beyond the Moonlight seal to bathe in blood and glory forever."
Finn says: "Nah."
Finn says: "This is a trap."
Jake says: "Ka-psshh."
Jake says: "We snuffed out that trap like champs!"
Jake says: "Trying to get us up in that cursed arena."
Finn says: "Then I'd bet the exits would all magically seal behind us."
Jake says: "We'd probably have to fight Gladiator Ghosts."
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "That sounds..."
Finn says: "so dumb..."
Finn says: "and FLIPPING AWESOME!"
Finn and Jake run back to the arena. They pass through the green aura.
Jake says: "We're back!"
Fight King says: "Fools!"
Fight King says: "All exits are sealed!"
Fight King says: "Now you must fight my Gladiator Ghosts!"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Okay."
Our heroes watch as a pair of ghostly gladiators emerge from the ground. They let out an unearthly moan and land in front of Finn and Jake. Hyperion swings his mace down at Finn, who dodges it.
Finn says: "Ooomph!"
Primo says: "Hyperion, I'm sorry!"
Jake dodges Primo's swing, but Primo grabs him as he stretches.
Primo says: "Hyperion, my love!"
Jake wraps his legs around Primo's neck, and squeezes until the ghost vanishes. Finn, meanwhile, is avoiding Hyperion's mace.
Hyperion says: "I'll kill you for breaking your promise!"
Finn grabs a sword lying on the ground, and decapitates Hyperion, who then vanishes.
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "Ah-ha-ha-ha."
Fight King says: "Good..."
Fight King says: "Take these branches of palm."
The Fight King's throne moves forward. Then he tosses two palm branches to Finn and Jake.
Finn says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "That prize kinda stinks."
Jake says: "Let's go, Finn."
Jake says: "My thighs hurt."
Finn says: "Aw, man."
Finn says: "Okay, it was fun."
Finn says: "I'm keeping the branch."
Fight King says: "Where do you think you're going?"
Fight King says: "You must earn thy freedom by defeating each of my ghosts!"
Fight King says: "When you are ready, speak the Fight King's name, and I shall raise you for..."
Fight King says: "battle."
Finn and Jake land in a cavern beneath the arena. It is filled with bones, weapons, shields, and armor. They get up. Jake walks over to Finn.
Finn says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "Okay, I have a plan."
Finn says: "We'll do what the Fight King says, and defeat his ghosts to earn our freedom."
Finn says: "You're gonna follow my plan, right?"
Jake says: "Mmm-hmm."
Jake says: "But, hey, if you replace me with a dummy, I could stay down here and dig for lava."
Jake says: "Then I'd forge a molten hula-hoop."
Finn says: "That's an entirely different plan..."
Finn says: "than my plan."
Finn says: "What's the hula-hoop for?"
Jake says: "Morale, dude, This tomb will be as fun..."
Jake says: "♪ As a tropical island, as a tropical island, as a tropical island, as a tropical island."
Finn tackles Jake, laughing.
Jake says: "Check it out, dude."
Jake says: "Ba-duh-buh-da."
Jake says: "It's a dirt dummy Jake."
Jake says: "Just like in the plan."
Jake winks at Finn and gives him the "thumbs up" sign. Then he shrinks down and hides in a skull's eye socket.
Finn says: "We're ready..."
Finn says: "I guess, Fight King."
A pillar emerges from the ground and brings Finn to the surface.
Fight King says: "Gladitoria continues for you, human, and, er..."
Fight King says: "dog?"
Finn says: "Yup."
Finn says: "This is dog."
Fight King says: "Arise, Priscus, Verus!"
The Fight King's sword glows. He swings it around in a circle. Two more ghostly gladiators emerge from the ground. The gladiators charge toward Finn, who grabs a trident and runs straight at them. He attacks Priscus head on. Verus futilely swings his blade around at the dummy of Jake, knocking it over.
Fight King says: "Pity."
Fight King says: "The dog falls."
Finn successfully disarms Priscus and kicks him back. He comes down. landing crotch first on top of his own tower shield.
Priscus says: "Et tu, Verus?"
Finn slashes Priscus down the middle with the trident. causing the specter to vanish.
Finn says: "Heh."
Fight King says: "The combat endeth."
Fight King says: "Now come closer, champion."
Cut to Jake in the underground cavern, digging in the dirt. He hears a gong sound twice.
Jake says: "Dig-dig-dig-dig-dig-dig-dig."
Jake says: "Two gongs?"
Jake says: "Something crazy's going on up there."
Jake says: "It's me, Jake."
Jake says: "Been here the whole time."
Jake says: "Huh?"
Fight King says: "Come closer, my champion."
Fight King says: "You have proven worthy of my favor."
Finn says: "Hah."
Finn says: "Word."
The Fight King touches Finn with his glowing sword. Finn's eyes glow green, and an aura surrounds him. Jake looks on.
Jake says: "Oh, this is bad."
Fight King says: "Accept your prize."
Jake says: "Finn?"
Fight King says: "Ah..."
Fight King says: "The dog lives."
Jake says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "I lives."
Jake says: "Finn, come with me, man."
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Jake says: "Dude?"
Finn says: "Sorry, man."
Finn says: "But you crossed my kill zone."
Fight King says: "Fighters, rest now."
Jake says: "So, how's your side of the plan going?"
Finn says: "Plan?"
Finn says: "What plan?"
Jake says: "To escape."
Jake says: "I dig and stuff, and you fight to win, 'member?"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Finn says: "I fight."
Finn says: "To hear bones breaking and meat tearing."
Jake says: "Ghosts don't got meat."
Finn says: "I fight..."
Finn says: "to FIGHT!"
Jake says: "Hmm..."
Jake says: "Finn's acting weird."
Jake says: "Probably due to a decrease in morale."
Jake says: "Gotta get him that lava hula-hoop."
Finn says: "We're ready for our next fight, Fight King."
Once again, Finn is raised to the surface by a pillar of dirt. He sets down the dirt dummy and grabs a pair of dual swords. The scene then reverts back to Jake.
Jake says: "Gotta liven up this unhallowed ground..."
Jake says: "."
Jake says: "for Finn."
Jake says: "♪ On a tropical island, underneath a molten lava moon."
Jake says: "Hanging with the hula dancers, asking questions 'cause they got all the answers..."
Back up on top, six more ghostly gladiators appear from the ground. They charge toward Finn. Finn runs wild with rage, slaying one ghost after the other.
Finn says: "Habet!"
Finn says: "Habet!"
Finn says: "Habet!"
Finn says: "Heh-heh-heh."
Achillea says: "Amazonia, I'm sorry!"
Finn says: "This next take-down is for you, my king!"
Finn says: "Rahhh..."
Finn says: "Heh-heh-heh."
Triumphus, the gladiator who is carrying the head of his partner Tetraides, begins sobbing.
Triumphus says: "I need your forgiveness..."
Jake says: "♪ Puttin' on lotion, sittin' by the ocean, rubbin' it on my body, rubbing it on my body..."
As Jake is singing, it's revealed he is making a fish tail around himself, consisting of a mound of dirt and two skeletal hands. The scene reverts back to Finn.
Rutuba says: "Non pugnent, Flamma!"
Finn says: "Eludere!"
Green light comes out of the Fight King's eyes and mouth. Finn leaps at Rutuba.
Rutuba says: "Cum missione, my friend!"
Finn says: "Hoc habet!"
Finn says: "Whaaa!"
Amazonia says: "Achillea..."
The sword takes off the heads of Amazonia, Romulus and Remus, who vanish.
Finn says: "I have defeated every gladiator."
Fight King says: "No, for there is one more opponent."
Finn says: "Who?"
Fight King says: "Your dear companion!"
The scene reverts back to Jake, who is finishing up his song. He raises to the surface.
Jake says: "♪ Get me out of this caa-a-ve, 'cause it's nothing but a gladiator graa-a-ve."
Jake says: "And if I stick to the plaa-a-n, I think I'll turn into a lava maa-a-n."
Jake says: "I think I'll turn into a lava man!"
Fight King says: "Why do you stop?"
Finn says: "Fight King, this Jake was a farce."
Finn says: "Let me face the real Jake!"
Jake gasps again.
Fight King says: "Then this is round two, my vassal!"
Fight King says: "Take his head for me!"
Finn says: "Yes, my king."
Jake says: "What about the plan?"
Finn says: "This is the plan, Jake!"
Finn says: "Raah!"
Jake says: "You're gonna kill me?"
Finn says: "That's right!"
Finn says: "Everything has been building to this!"
Finn says: "The final battle!"
Finn says: "Brother against brother!"
Finn says: "TO THE DEATH!"
Jake says: "No!"
Fight King says: "Yes..."
Jake keeps stretching throughout the arena, trying to avoid Finn's blade. He even wraps Finn up in his coils.
Fight King says: "Yes..."
Finn says: "I can't kill him, Fight King."
Finn says: "I can't kill my best friend."
Jake says: "Finn?"
Finn says: "Not without a BIGGER SWORD!"
Fight King says: "Yes..."
Fight King says: "FINISH HIM!!!"
The Fight King throws his golden sword toward Finn. Finn catches it.
Jake says: "No!"
Just when it looks like he really is about to kill Jake, Finn throws it down. The sword shatters when it hits the ground.
Fight King says: "Aaarghh..."
Finn says: "Wink."
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "Dude, did you..."
Jake says: "?"
Jake says: "Was that all fake?"
Jake says: "Did you act all that out?"
Jake says: "Was that part of your plan?"
Finn says: "Mmm-hmm."
Just then, the Gladiator Ghosts appear behind Finn and Jake. Everyone leaves the arena.
Jake says: "So you planned to get all cozy with the Fight King and almost kill me from the get-go?"
Finn says: "Pretty much."
Jake says: "Why didn't you say so?"
Finn says: "Because you always bungle my plans."
Finn says: "But, if you had bungled this one..."
Finn says: "I might have, for real, chopped your head off."
Finn and Jake both exchange laughs.
Jake says: "That's some funky junk, brother."
Finn says: "Hey, Jake, you notice how all these ghosts are walking in pairs?"
The Gladiator Ghosts all start ascending to the heavens.
Jake says: "Oh, yeah."
Jake says: "I bet they're like us."
Jake says: "Best bros who got trapped in that arena."
Finn says: "But now they're free!"
Finn and Jake fist bump as the arena comes apart behind them and ascends toward the skies along with the Fight King's ghosts.
The episode ends.
