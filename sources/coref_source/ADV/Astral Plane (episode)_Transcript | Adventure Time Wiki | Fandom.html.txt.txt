The scene opens with a starry night sky, a shooting star whizzes by. Finn & Jake are out camping. Each are on a sleeping bag. While Finn is looking up, Jake pokes at the fire with a stick.
Finn says: "Jake, so I just had this weird thought."
Jake says: "Well, that's normal; people always have weird thoughts around campfires."
Finn says: "Well, I don't know."
Finn says: "Isn't is sort of strange that we keep pets?"
Finn says: "We kind of make them worship us."
Jake says: "What?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Nah."
Finn says: "No, seriously, think about it."
Finn says: "We're their only source of food and water and, like, tummy rubs."
Finn says: "They basically have to love us."
Jake says: "What's wrong with tummy rubs?"
Finn says: "Yeah, tummy rubs are pretty great."
Finn says: "It's so cool."
Finn says: "Wonder what it is, a planet?"
Finn says: "Do people live there?"
Finn says: "Are they friendly?"
Finn says: "Do they keep pets?"
Finn's eyes are still on the light. The light shifts into comet-like form. Back at the campsite a sleeping Finn finds himself astral project away from his body.
Finn says: "Whoa..."
Finn says: "holy."
Finn says: "Oh- right."
Inside the house is a sleeping Mr. Fox.
Mr. Fox says: "Mmm, Boobafina, just pay me back when you can."
Finn says: "Aww."
Astral Mr. Fox says: "Hello?"
Finn says: "Oh!"
Finn says: "Hey, you can see me?!"
Finn says: "!"
Astral Mr. Fox says: "See you..."
Astral Mr. Fox says: "?"
Astral Mr. Fox says: "But if I didn't see you..."
Astral Mr. Fox says: "Wait, what did you originally ask me?"
Finn says: "Oh, forget it, it's cool."
Astral Mr. Fox says: "Do you, want a drink or something?"
Astral Mr. Fox says: "I think I only have water anyway."
Astral Mr. Fox says: "."
Finn says: "Whoop, here I go!"
Finn says: "Bye!"
Astral Mr. Fox says: "Oh, that was sort of rude."
Astral Mr. Fox says: "I hope he comes back."
Finn says: "Guess you get a lot of work done though."
The scene changes to show Bounce House Princess and giggling from inside of her. She looks at her watch.
Bounce House Princess says: "Quittin' time!"
Finn says: "Bounce House Princess."
Finn says: "Hey, this place is pretty nice."
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Bounce House Princess says: "."
Bounce House Princess says: "Who's there?!"
Bounce House Princess says: "!"
A porcupine has entered the house through a door flap. It looks around and heads towards the kitchen area.
Bounce House Princess says: "."
Bounce House Princess says: "Everything's okay now."
Finn says: "Aww, geez, poor Bounce House Princess."
Finn says: "Wha?"
The porcupine rubs up against the door and gradually moves over to the punch pad, its quills hit the correct code and the door opens. Bounce House Princess drops her jar of fruit and stands frozen. The porcupine walks in a laps up the dropped fruit. Bounce House Princess weeps in fear.
Finn says: "Oh, hey, Cloud Kingdom."
Finn says: "What the?"
Finn says: "Ice King?"
Ice King says: "Yeah, I guess there's some cool people here, musics a little loud but the but the punch is top-drawer."
Ice King says: "Hey, you should come to one of my parties sometime; I'm friends with some pretty cool people too you know?"
Lauren says: "Uh huh, who are your friends?"
Ice King says: "Oh, uh- like that guy, Finn."
Lauren says: "Finn?!"
Lauren says: "!"
Ice King says: "Yeah, Finn and I are pretty tight!"
Cloud Woman 2 says: "Oh, hi, are you the ice-dude?"
Ice King says: "."
Ice King says: "Hey, have you ever seen the inside of an ice bear cave?"
Lauren says: "Did you say you know Finn the Human?"
Ice King says: "Yeah, yeah, now scram."
Lauren says: "Hey, is Finn seeing anyone right now?"
Lauren says: "Could you introduce us?"
Ice King says: "So I guess you're more into the 'little brother-type'?"
Ice King says: "Huh."
Ice King says: "."
Ice King says: "Eh, this party was weak anyway."
Now above Marceline and continuing upwards towards the stratosphere.
Finn says: "Sheesh, I wonder if being a sad loner gives you more raw material to form song ideas."
Finn says: "Is that where creativity comes from?"
Finn says: "From sad-biz?"
Finn says: "Space Lards!"
Finn says: "Ah man, Jake would be flipping out; trying to get that super-rare milk."
Finn says: "Make a sick flan with that milk."
Finn says: "Oh, well."
The Space Lards stop circling and sit up right.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "What's going on?"
Finn says: "You can't see me, right?"
Finn says: "Everybody's leaving!"
The scene changes to being on Mars. Grob Gob Glob Grod is there along with a man, Star Man, sitting at a large machine. The machine is aimed at the pulsating light, the comet Finn saw before.
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "Fire defense missiles!"
[The Martian defense missiles launch from their defense silos. Target says: "the Catalyst Comet."
Star Man says: "Missiles away!"
Star Man says: "Impact with Catalyst Comet in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!"
IMPACT! The missiles hit the Comet!
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "Yes!"
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "Do you think it worked, Star Man?"
Star Man says: "Shoot!"
Star Man says: "No effect!"
Star Man says: "It's still coming right at us!"
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "Was that all of our missiles?"
Star Man says: "Uh, yeah, I'm surprised we even had those ones."
Star Man says: "Like who would we shoot a missile at?"
Star Man says: "Who'd we shoot at?!"
Star Man says: "!"
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "I'm thinking, Star Man!"
Star Man says: "Rooot!"
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "Grob."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "Assessment."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "We're sunk, bro."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "This whole place is gonna be a stinkin' molten dump in a minute."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "It doesn't make sense."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "Every 1,000 years, the Catalyst Comet mysteriously reincarnates itself and collides with Earth, bringing with it an agent of change."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "But the comet has never been so off schedule - and it's never freakin' hit Mars!"
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "What do you think, Finn the Human?"
Finn says: "Wha?"
Finn says: "Who, me?"
Finn says: "You can see me too?"
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "Yes, I am Glob."
Finn says: "Oh yeah."
Finn says: "Hey, do you ever say "Oh my Glob?"
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "No, but sometimes Gob does."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "You're dreaming so far from home, it must be comet related."
Finn says: "Yeah, but, I gotta question."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "What's that?"
Finn says: "Well, if just being born is the greatest act of creation."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "Well, itâ€™s not enough to have created something amazing, right?"
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "What if I just let my Martian supersociety go to butt?"
Finn says: "But what's it worth if we're all gonna get blowed up right now?"
Star Man says: "Whoa!"
Star Man says: "What are you doing?!"
Star Man says: "!"
Finn says: "Ahhh!"
Finn says: "Oh my bod!"
Jake says: "What is it, boyi?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Glob is dead."
Above Mars, the fleet of ships saw the explosion.
Evacuation Man says: "Hello, Star Man, this is Evacuation Man, what's the sitch, can we go back yet?"
Star Man says: "Yes!"
Star Man says: "Gob Glob Grod Grob diverted the comet, it's back on its normal path to Earth."
Evacuation Man says: "And what about the G-Man?"
Star Man says: "No sign of Glob."
As it appears, the "comet" is really a star cruiser... and inside this ship's bridge is Finn's father, Martin.
Martin says: "Ahh!"
Martin says: "Computer!"
Martin says: "What did we hit?!"
Martin says: "!"
Finn says: "Hey, I think Bounce House Princess needs our help."
Jake says: "Let's do it!"
Episode ends.
