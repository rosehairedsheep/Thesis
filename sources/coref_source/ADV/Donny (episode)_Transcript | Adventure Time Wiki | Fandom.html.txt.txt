Jake says: "Patrol!"
Jake says: "Safety patrol!"
Jake says: "Safety—"
Jake says: "Oh..."
Jake says: "Were we not wearing the uniforms?"
Finn says: "C'mon."
Finn says: "Let's keep lookin' for hazards."
Finn says: "Look out!"
Jake says: "What is it, dude?"
Finn says: "Shushers, man!"
Finn says: "Look there!"
Jake says: "Just looks like an ordinary little town, man."
Finn says: "Yeah..."
Finn says: "Suspiciously ordinary."
Finn says: "Oh!"
Finn says: "Little house people!"
Finn says: "Maybe it is just regular ordinary, not sinister ordinary—"
Finn says: "oh, no, wait..."
Finn says: "Grass ogre."
Donny says: "Haha!"
Finn says: "It's an obnoxious grass ogre."
Donny says: "You get my joke, right?!"
Donny says: "!"
Donny says: "Hahaha!"
Barn House says: "Careful, you oaf!"
Barn House says: "Those chickens are rentals!"
Barn House says: "Agh!"
Donny says: "We're havin' so much fun, huh?!"
Donny says: "!"
Jail House says: "Drop that chicken!"
Donny says: "Huh?"
Jail House says: "You're under arrest!"
Jail House says: "Good..."
Jail House says: "Now get in your tiny cell..."
Jail House says: "Oh, uh, oh!"
Donny picks up the Jail House Person and lays him down on his back. Donny laughs.
Finn says: "Hey, ogre!"
Finn says: "Stop hazing these cute little houses!"
Jake says: "Ya jerkball!"
Donny says: "My name is Donny, idiot!"
Finn says: "Sorry."
Finn says: "I was just tryina' get your attention."
Donny says: "What kinda houses are you supposed to be?"
Donny says: "A..."
Donny says: "stupid..."
Donny says: "uh..."
Donny says: "a dumb house?!"
Donny says: "!"
Donny says: "Haha!"
Donny says: "Hey, what's with your jowl?!"
Donny says: "!"
Jake says: "Ow!"
Donny says: "Hahaha!"
Donny says: "I'm gonna mess with these housies some more."
Finn says: "NEVER!!"
Finn runs up to Donny and jumps on his back, attempting to stop him.
Donny says: "So you wanna wrestle, huh?"
Donny says: "'Cause I know, like, this ninja move to get out of this lock instantly!"
Donny says: "Okay..."
Donny says: "Now, first I..."
Donny says: "Hey!"
Donny says: "You're doin' it wrong!!"
Jake wiggles his finger and stretches one of them out.
Jake says: "Whoa."
Finn says: "You're doin' it wrong!"
Donny says: "Whaddaya mean?"
Finn says: "First, you roll your right shoulder forward..."
Donny picks Finn up.
Donny says: "Like this?"
Finn says: "Yeah, but then I counter it by doin' this!"
Donny says: "Hey!"
Donny begins to pant heavily.
Finn says: "Um..."
Finn says: "You need to take a break?"
Donny says: "No..."
Donny says: "but if you need to, we can stop..."
Donny says: "Ya baby."
Jake says: "Whoa, I zoned out there for a bit."
Jake says: "Did you win?"
Finn says: "Nah."
Finn says: "Just takin' five."
Finn says: "Donny's pretty good."
Donny says: "Yeah, well, you're okay, too."
Finn says: "Thanks, man."
Donny says: "..."
Donny says: "For a complete idiot!"
Finn says: "Aww..."
Donny laughs.
Jake says: "Donald, quit all this jerky nonsense!"
Jake says: "Unless you wanna get gored by a forest prince!"
Donny says: "I was just kiddin' around, but then you took it too far!"
Donny says: "You guys are the real jerks!"
Jake says: "Donny is one mixed-up dude."
Finn says: "Nah."
Finn says: "He's just rough-and-tumble, like me, but deep down, he's probably really sensitive, like me."
Jake says: "You're a mixed-up dude, too!"
Finn says: "Hey, Donny!"
Donny says: "What?"
Finn says: "I was thinkin' that since you're a pretty good wrestler, maybe you'd wanna hang out with a couple a' rascals like me and Jake!"
Jake says: "What?"
Donny says: "Muuuh..."
Donny says: "I don't know."
Donny says: "Messin' with these housies is pretty fun."
Donny says: "You got somethin' better?"
Jake says: "You sure this is a good idea?"
Finn says: "If you come to the Tree Fort, we got video games and apple juice!"
Donny says: "I mean..."
Donny says: "if it keeps you from cryin'..."
Finn says: "Donny's problem is that he's treated like an outsider, like me."
Jake says: "You are not an outsider."
Jake says: "You wear cute little blue shorts!"
Finn says: "I..."
Finn says: "am complicated."
Scene transition; the three are at the Tree Fort.
Donny says: "Uh..."
Donny says: "This fort isn't so great."
Donny says: "Not as cool as the fort I'm gonna build."
Donny says: "I call this chair!"
Finn says: "Hey, Donny, you should play Bug Battle."
Jake says: "And hey, can you put on some pants?!"
Jake says: "!"
Donny says: "You put on some pants!"
Jake says: "I have pants..."
Jake says: "spun from spiderwebs..."
Jake says: "by pixies."
The game starts.
Finn says: "Okay."
Finn says: "There's you, and here come the bugs."
Donny destroys the bugs in the game. Donny starts laughing. Suddenly, a spider drops from above and kills the video game character.
Donny says: "Huh?!"
Donny says: "!"
Finn says: "Oh, yeah."
Finn says: "Those guys'll get ya."
Jake says: "Not cool, dude."
Finn says: "Have more apple juice."
Finn says: "It always makes me feel better when I—"
Finn says: "Aaah!"
Finn says: "Donny!"
Finn says: "Quit being a jerk!"
Donny says: "What?"
Donny says: "What'd I do?"
Jake says: "Finn, I don't think this is gonna work."
BMO says: "I am incapable of all emotion..."
BMO says: "."
BMO says: "but you are making me chafed!!"
Donny says: "Everybody's gettin' mad at me for nothin'!"
Finn says: "You have to think about how your actions make other people feel."
Donny says: "Ohh."
Donny says: "Hmm."
Donny says: "I don't understand at all."
Jake says: "Ooh!"
Jake says: "Teach him that little empathy song I taught you!"
Finn says: "Okay, yeah!"
Finn says: "Your turn!"
Donny says: "Uh..."
Donny says: "Empathy, empathy, put yourself..."
Donny says: "Ohh!"
Donny says: "So it's like, when I squeeze eggs outta chickens, I should let them squeeze eggs outta me, too!"
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "Um..."
Finn says: "kinda right."
Jake says: "Dude, trade me jobs."
A loud crash is heard.
Donny says: "Jake!"
Donny says: "Someone broke your..."
Donny says: "um..."
Donny says: "entire living room!"
Jake slaps his hand against his face. The scene changes to the house "village" where werewolves are terrorizing the House People.
Bank House says: "Quick!"
Bank House says: "Act abandoned!"
He and the Girl With Glasses House do so. The wolf growls at the Dog House, and Finn punches him.
Finn says: "Hands off the housing market!"
Jail House says: "Stop in the name of the law!"
Finn grabs the Jail House and keeps running.
Finn says: "Is there somewhere I can trap that thing?"
Jail House says: "Well, there was a zoo, but he moved back east."
Jail House says: "Course, there's always the old well."
Well says: "I'm not old!"
Finn says: "Perfect!"
Finn says: "Slam-bam-in-a-can!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Another werewolf?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "?"
Finn says: "What's up with this town?!"
Finn says: "!"
A Siamese twin wolf bites attacks the bank house. Finn forces the wolf into the well with another House Person.
Finn says: "Mr."
Finn says: "Bank!"
Finn says: "Are you alright?!"
Finn says: "!"
Bank House says: "Oh, it's fine, it's fine."
Bank House says: "All my assets are insured."
Bank House says: "Pardon."
Bank House says: "I have to go spackle my cracks."
Finn says: "Why is this town just getting worse and worse?"
Wolf says: "Yes!"
Wolf says: "Why indeed!!"
Finn says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "What are you werewolves up to?!"
Finn says: "!"
Wolf says: "We're not werewolves..."
Wolf says: "We're Why-wolves."
Finn says: "Uh..."
Finn says: "Why-wolves?"
Why-wolf says: "Creatures possessed by the spirit of inquiry..."
Why-wolf says: ".."
Why-wolf says: "AND..."
Why-wolf says: "BLOODLUST!!"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Oh, no!"
Finn says: "I have to get Donny back!"
Scene shifts back to the Tree Fort. Finn barges in.
Finn says: "Donny, you have to go right now, and stop the Why-wolves from—"
Donny is playing a cello and Jake his viola.
Donny says: "Ah!"
Donny says: "Master Finn has returned!"
Finn says: "What's it goin'?!"
Finn says: "!"
Donny says: "Thanks to you, I shall never be jerky again!"
Finn says: "Oh, no..."
Finn says: "Oh, no."
Finn says: "Oh, no, nonononononono!"
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "This is all wrong!"
Finn says: "We need jerk Donny to make the obnoxygen, and, and—"
Donny says: "Steady on, Finn."
Donny says: "Perhaps you are dehydrated!"
Donny says: "It's as Jake taught me:  I'll fetch you some tap water."
Finn says: "Are you wearing jeans now?!"
Finn says: "!"
Donny says: "Surely!"
Finn says: "But, but, but—"
Jake says: "Butt, butt, butt!"
Jake says: "Yeah, Donny!"
Jake says: "You're lookin' good in those jeans!"
Finn says: "What did you do?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Miraculous, isn't it?"
Jake says: "I just kept teachin' him my musical rules, and now, he's perfect."
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "We messed up, Jake!"
Finn says: "The House People are doomed if Donny doesn't go back to being town jerk!"
Donny says: "I have no intention of being a jerk again."
Donny says: "Hmph."
Finn says: "But the housies will be wiped out if you don't!"
Donny says: "It sounds tragic, but I'm turning over a new leaf!"
Finn says: "Donny, you gotta go!"
Donny says: "Finn, "no" means, "no."
Donny says: "" I'm sure you'll respect my wishes."
Donny says: "No!"
Donny says: "Stop!"
Donny says: "No!"
Finn says: "Now, go be a jerk to those Why-wolves!"
Donny says: "No!"
Donny says: "I'll use my musical messages to stop them!"
Donny says: "Let's see..."
Donny says: "I've got one on the ethics of laundry..."
Donny says: "Crosswalk-ery..."
Donny says: "Ooh!"
Donny says: "Here's a good one!"
Finn says: "Man!"
Finn says: "The town is getting creamed!"
Finn says: "By not being a jerk, you're being a real jerk, Donny!!"
Donny says: "Why isn't anybody paying attention to my words?"
Finn says: "It's cuz they think your songs are dumb!"
Donny says: "Wha?!"
Donny says: "!"
Jake says: "HEY, DONNY!"
Jake says: "EVERYONE SAYS YOUR SONGS ARE SUPER BALLS!!"
Finn says: "They all think you're a real jerk!"
Donny says: "But..."
Donny says: "but I've changed!"
Donny says: "Why would they say that?!"
Donny says: "!"
Donny says: "Empathy, empathy, put your mind insi..."
The Why-wolves and House People laugh at him.
Why-wolf says: "You're so pathetic!"
Why-wolf says: "So comical!"
The Bank House laughs at him.
Donny says: "HAHAHAHA!!"
Why-wolf says: "Obnoxygen cloud!!"
Why-wolf says: "EGRESS!!"
The Why-wolves run away howling. Donny pants heavily.
House People says: "The town is saved!!"
The housies gather around Donny in celebration.
Donny says: "Get offa' me, nerds!!"
Finn says: "You did it, Donny!"
Finn says: "You're a full-blown jerk again!"
Donny says: "What?!"
Donny says: "!"
Donny says: "You're the jerk!!"
Donny says: "Housies!"
Donny says: "Ready to hear my new song?!"
Donny says: "!"

Finn says: "I'm sorry, Donny."
Donny says: "I'll never forgive you, Finn!!"
Donny says: "WAAAAAAH!!!"
Jake says: "C'mon."
Jake says: "We can go stare wistfully at the lake."
Finn says: "I'd..."
Finn says: "I'd like that."
Finn says: "Very much."
Donny continues pelting the housies with eggs, laughing.
Donny says: "Hey!"
Donny says: "I love bein' a jerk!"
Donny says: "Thanks, Finn!"
Donny says: "Finn?"
Donny says: "I'll never..."
