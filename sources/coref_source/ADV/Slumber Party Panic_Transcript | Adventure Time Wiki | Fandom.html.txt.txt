The episode begins in the Candy Kingdom, Jake is playfully chasing Lady Rainicorn.
Jake says: "Yeah, you think you're pretty way up there but I can get you!"
Finn and Princess Bubblegum are in a cemetery with a table full of different chemicals.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Alright."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Let me just add three more drops of explosive diarrhea."
She adds the explosive diarrhea and a giant cloud shaped like a skull puffs out. Not a good omen.
Finn says: "Oooo..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oooo..."
Finn says: "Hey Princess Bubblegum, when we bring the dead back to life, will it be filled with worms?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "No."
Princess Bubblegum says: "If my decorpsinator serum works, all the dead Candy People will look as young and healthy as you do."
Finn does a "Tarzan-yell" while hitting his hands against his chest.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Pick up that platter, tough guy."
Finn picks up a serving platter and open the lid, revealing a Candy Person corpse.
Finn says: "Old Mr."
Finn says: "Cream Puff?"
Mr. Cream Puff's corpse starts to glow and overflow with the fizzing serum.
Finn says: "Something's happening!"
Finn says: "Come on, come on..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Work."
A zombie Mr. Cream Puff arises and moans.
Finn says: "Algebraic!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Wait, something's wrong."
Zombie Mr. Cream Puff says: "Sugar!"
Finn says: "Ew!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Ew!"
Zombie Mr. Cream Puff leaps into a giant test tube. The test tube falls and infects the whole cemetery. Zombie Candy People begin to arise from their graves.
Finn says: "Hey, look, the decorpsinator serum is working!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "No, this is wrong."
Princess Bubblegum says: "They're not coming back to life--they're still dead!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "The decorpsinator serum--it's incomplete!"
Zombie Love Heart says: "Rah."
Zombie Love Heart says: "Must eat sugar!"
Finn says: "You're grounded, Mister."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, this is really bad."
Princess Bubblegum says: "They're going to be attracted to the Candy Kingdom!"
Finn says: "Why?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Because the Candy People are made of sugar, ya ding dong!"
Zombie Mr. Cream Puff says: "Gimme some sugar, baby."
Finn says: "Chew on this!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Good one, Finn."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Quickly, to the kingdom!"
They run out of the cemetery.
Finn says: "Get a life!"
Princess Bubblegum is at the top of her castle, ringing a large bell.
Princess Bubblegum says: "All citizens of the Candy Kingdom!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Report to the palace, immediately!"
Candy People mumble in confusion and walk to the palace.
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Jake and Lady go off to the palace. Princess Bubblegum notices the zombies slowly leaving the cemetery.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hurry, sweet citizens."
Finn says: "Alright, you heard the princess, everyone in!"
Finn says: "Alright, no pushing, come on!"
Jake says: "Dude, what's up?"
Finn says: "The princess will explain everything."
Finn says: "Tree Trunks, get those hot buns in here, girl."
Tree Trunks says: "Oh, I hope it's not bad news."
Princess Bubblegum and Finn close the door.
Finn says: "Did we get everyone?"
Manfried says: "All present and accounted for."
Finn says: "Thanks, Manfried."
Manfried says: "You're welcome."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Citizens, we are assembled here in the candy foyer for a momentous announcement."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Tonight we are all going to have..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "a slumber party!"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Crowd cheers.
Finn says: "Wait!"
Finn says: "What about the zom--?!"
Finn says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Go ahead and start partying."
Princess Bubblegum says: "We'll be right back, everyone."
Jake says: "Whooo!"
In the lab.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn, the Candy People can't know about the zombies."
Finn says: "Wha?!"
Finn says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "If they knew, they would flip out."
Finn says: "What do you mean "flip out"?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I mean they would flip out."
Scene changes to the cemetery; Starchie arrives with a shovel.
Starchie says: "Princess?"
Starchie says: "It's me, Starchie the gravedigger."
Starchie says: "I brought you a larger corpse shovel."
Starchie says: "Oh, Princess?"
Starchie says: "Well, I'll just wait for you here, then."
Starchie says: "By the mausoleum."
Starchie says: "With my back turned."
Starchie says: "And my defenses lowered."
As Starchie does so, Candy Zombie comes out of the mausoleum and goes up to Starchie, Starchie starts to scream and gasp and then... KABOOM!!! He explodes in a flash of light. Back at the castle.
Finn says: "Candy People explode when they get scared?!"
Finn says: "!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Not telling the Candy People about the zombies is so important that you need to promise, Royal Promise, not to let anyone find out about the zombies, ever."
Finn says: "Okay, sure."
Princess Bubblegum says: "No, Finn."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You have to Royal Promise."
Finn says: "Yes,  I Royal Promise."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Now I must cloister myself in the lab and finish the equation to my decorpsinator serum."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You keep the candy folk distracted and ignorant."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Can you do that?"
Finn says: "Yes, your highness."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Good."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Don't tell anyone about the zombies."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Never ever."
Finn says: "No, wait."
Finn says: "Can I at least tell  Jake?"
Jake says: "Tell me about what, dude?"
Jake says: "Alright, what's going on?"
Finn says: "Uhh, nothing at all, buddy!"
Jake says: "Hey, dude."
Jake says: "I think you and Bubblegum are up to something."
Finn says: "Ahha ah, what?"
Finn says: "No, no way."
Jake says: "Whoa, you guys are up to something."
Jake says: "Is it some sort of prank?"
Jake says: "Can I get in on it?"
Finn says: "Who wants to play "Truth or Dare"?"
Jake says: "Hmm..."
Finn says: "Ok, Chocoberry, you may ask someone to tell a deep truth or a saucy dare."
Chocoberry says: "Mr."
Chocoberry says: "Cupcake, truth or dare?"
Mr. Cupcake says: "Dare."
Chocoberry says: "I dare you to take off your wrapper."
Everyone goes "Oooh".
Jake says: "Hey seriously, man."
Jake says: "I'm your bro."
Jake says: "Bros are supposed to tell bros everything all the time."
Jake says: "What are you and Bubblegum up to?"
Jake says: "Is everything alright?"
Finn says: "Yep!"
Finn says: "Fine!"
Finn says: "Everything is great!"
Finn says: "Heh, heh."
Finn says: "Except for that."
Finn says: "Whoa."
Mr. Cupcake has shed his wrapper.
Peppermint Butler says: "I didn't know he was chocolate."
Mr. Cupcake says: "Jake, truth or dare?"
Jake says: "Truth."
Mr. Cupcake says: "Do you prefer chocolate or fudge?"
Jake says: "I can't eat chocolate or fudge 'cause I'm a dog and they'd probably kill me, but hmmmmm probably..."
Jake says: "neither."
Jake says: "Finn!"
Jake says: "Truth or dare?"
Finn says: "Dare!"
Finn says: "Haha!"
Jake says: "I dare you..."
Jake says: "to tell me the truth about what's going on in your mind."
Jake says: "What were you and Bubblegum talking about when you were alone together?"
Everybody goes "Oooh".
Finn says: "Umm, ahh, the truth is, ahhh..."
Finn visualizes Princess Bubblegum's face on Jake.
Hallucination of Princess Bubblegum says: "You promised you wouldn't freakin' tell anyone!"
Hallucination of Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, you're so cute, Finn."
Finn says: "Ahhh..."
Finn says: "the truth is..."
Finn says: "that I'd rather play Dodge Socks!"
Finn throws a sock at Jake, Princess Bubblegum's face goes away.
Jake says: "I'm not playing dodge socks 'til you stop dodging my questions."
Jake says: "Hey..."
Jake says: "Old Mr."
Jake says: "Cream Puff?"
Jake says: "Isn't he dead?"
Finn says: "Hey, give me my sock back!"
Finn says: "Dodge Socks was a bad idea!"
Jake says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "Look dude, just tell me what's up, 'cause you are crazier than a cannonball tonight."
Finn looks out a window behind Jake and sees the zombies coming.
Finn says: "Oh, my goodness!"
Finn says: "Princess hasn't finished the equation and the zombies are here!"
Finn says: "I, uh, she just want this slumber party to be super fun, and if I did have something to tell you, then I would in a second, and it would make my life easier, unless there was something stopping me, like a promise, but there isn't, so I won't, so it's cool."
Zombie arises by the window behind Jake.
Zombie says: "Sugar!"
Finn shuts the shutters.
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "You lost me."
Finn says: "Umm..."
Finn says: "Hey, you know what time it is?"
Jake says: "Adventure time?"
Finn says: "No, time for Seven Minutes in Heaven!"
Finn says: "You're first."
Jake says: "Really?"
Finn says: "Lady Rainicorn!"
Finn says: "In the closet with Jake!"
Lady says: "뭐?"
Lady says: "나?"
Lady says: "웃겨 정말."
Lady says: "그래, 좋아."
Lady says: "하자."
Jake says: "Okay, okay, alright."
Jake says: "But in seven minutes, I'm gonna come out and make you spill your beans, Finn."
Finn says: "I can't hear you all the way in heaven!"
Finn looks out a window, a horde of zombies shouting "Sugar" comes and begins banging on door.
Chet says: "Umm, does anyone else hear that?"
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Hear what?"
Finn says: "I, I don't hear anything."
Candy People begin to murmur as they too hear the banging.
Chet says: "I hear something I don't understand..."
Chet says: "and it makes me scared!"
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "No, Chet."
Finn says: "Everybody, wait."
Finn says: "What noise?"
Finn says: "You mean this noise?"
Chet says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "Dance it!"
Finn says: "Bust it up!"
Finn says: "Uh!"
Finn says: "Uh!"
Finn says: "Uh!"
Finn says: "Oh!"
A zombie comes out of the main door, Finn rushes to the door, grabbing a table.
Chocoberry says: "What is this game you are playing at now, Finn?"
Finn barricades the door with the table.
Finn says: "Uhh, it's..."
Finn says: "Blockado."
Finn says: "Haha, the game of barricades."
Finn says: "Come on, let's block all the entrances and windows!"
Candy People cheer and begin blockading the doors and windows before the zombies can come in.
Finn says: "Alright, this is not a permanent solution."
Finn says: "Think Finn, how can you keep everyone from finding out?"
Manfried says: "Find out about what, Finn?"
Finn says: "Manfried, the talking piñata!"
Finn says: "Your convenient appearance gives me a great idea."
Finn says: "Everyone, grab a stick!"
Finn says: "New game!"
Finn says: "We're gonna smash some piñatas!"
Manfried says: "What?"
Finn says: "Except for you, Manfried."
Manfried says: "Oh, thank goodness."
Finn takes some strips off of Taffy Girl.
Finn says: "Now everybody don these blindfolds."
Finn says: "Thanks, Taffy Girl."
Finn runs into the middle of the blindfolded Candy People swinging sticks.
Finn says: "Alright, everybody, get together."
Finn says: "I'm hanging the piñatas..."
Finn says: "They're all around you."
Finn says: "Smash the piñatas!"
Finn and the Candy People smash all the zombies.
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "You guys are on fire!"
Chocoberry smashes a zombie, causing candy to fall out. She kneels down and licks the candy.
Chocoberry says: "Oh, it is so tasty."
All the Candy Zombies are smashed and the Candy People are eating their candy.
Finn says: "Yes!"
Finn says: "We did it!"
Finn says: "My improbable plan worked!"
Jake and Lady come out of the closet.
Jake says: "Whew!"
Lady says: "안녕!"
Jake says: "Seven minutes up yet?"
Jake says: "What the nuts happened here?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Oh, we killed all the zombies that Princess Bubblegum and I raised from the dead."
Jake says: "Really!"
Jake says: "?"
Time freezes, leaving only Finn moving in the room.
Finn says: "Jake?"
Finn says: "What's going on?"
Princess Bubblegum enters, unaffected by the freezing.
Princess Bubblegum says: "What?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Huh?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, Finn!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Did you break your Royal Promise?"
Finn says: "Yeah, but, I mean, all the zombies are dead."
Finn says: "The Candy People won't freak out."
Finn says: "What's the big deal?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "This is really, really bad, Finn."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You can't break Royal Promises."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Never, ever, never."
Princess Bubblegum says: "No matter what, forever."
The room starts shaking.
Princess Bubblegum says: "The Guardians of the Royal Promise are coming for us."
A hand bursts through the ceiling and grabs Finn and Princess Bubblegum and pulls them outside.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Whoa!"
Guardian 1 says: "Finn the Human."
Guardian 1 says: "You have broken a Royal Promise for which the penalty is trial by fire."
Guardian 2 breathes fire.
Finn says: "That's stupid."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Wait!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "He's my friend!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Isn't there another option?!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "!"
Guardian 1 says: "Yes."
Guardian 1 says: "Because you care for the promise-breaker, we will give him a less hot trial."
Guardian 1 says: "You must now answer..."
Guardian 2 says: "..."
Guardian 2 says: "Math questions!"
Finn says: "Mathematical!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Finn, you're terrible at math."
Finn says: "Awww."
Guardian 1 says: "Now, solve this!"
Finn says: "Uhh..."
Finn says: "."
Guardian 2 says: "Oh, wait, wait, I thought of a better one."
Guardian 1 says: "Yes!"
Guardian 1 says: "Two plus two."
Guardian 1 says: "Solve it or die."
Finn says: "Uhh."
Finn says: "Four, right?"
Guardians laugh.
Guardian 1 says: "Oh, correct."
Guardians heads explode and time rewinds, night becomes day, Guardian 2's head comes back and he talks backwards and goes back to sitting and blowing bubbles around the Candy Kingdom.
Finn says: "What's happening, Princess?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "You've defeated the broken royal promise!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "The Gumball Guardians are resetting!"
Guardian 1 drops Finn and Princess Bubblegum, who teleport back to Princess Bubblegum's lab.
Finn says: "Slamacow!"
Finn says: "That was tops!"
Finn says: "Who's not good at math?"
Finn says: "I was all "Four!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Four, four..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Four, four, four..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "That's it!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "The answer was so simple, I was too smart to see it!"
Finn says: "You're welcome!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "'4' is the last figure I need to perfect my decorpsinator serum."
In the foyer, Princess Bubblegum pours the serum on a zombie.
Revived Zombie says: "Golly!"
Finn and Princess Bubblegum pour the serum on all the zombies.
Finn says: "Woohoo!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "This is messed up, but sweet."
Lady Rainicorn says: "진짜로."
Finn and Princess Bubblegum revive more Candy Zombies.
Candy Person 1 says: "Uncle Chewy!"
Candy Person 2 says: "Grandma!"
Ice Cream Lady says: "Former dead relative!"
Jake says: "Starchie!"
Starchie says: "Mornin'."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I hope you grasp the full consequences of breaking promises."
Finn says: "Heck yeah!"
Finn says: "If I break a Royal Promise, I get to fight zombies, throw slumber parties, awake Gumball Guardians and..."
Finn says: "and..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Alright, alright."
Finn says: "And reverse death itself!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, you are adorable."
Princess Bubblegum says: "But keep your promises, okay?"
Finn says: "I will, Princess."
Finn notices Starchie gnawing on his leg and picks him up.
Finn says: "Starchie, you're not a zombie."
Starchie says: "I can't help it."
Starchie says: "Flesh is delicious!"
Finn says: "You're delicious!"
Starchie says: "Don't squeeze me!"
Starchie says: "I'll fart!"
Finn squeezes him, Starchie farts.
