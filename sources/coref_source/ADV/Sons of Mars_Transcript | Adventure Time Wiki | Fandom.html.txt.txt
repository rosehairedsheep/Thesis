The episode begins with what appears to be the Stag walking in a forest, crossing a train track.
Magic Man says: "Oh, Glob."
Gob says: "He's here somewhere, my brothers."
Gob says: "Glob, can you see Magic Man on the sensor?"
Glob says: "Yes, Gob."
Glob says: "Our little brother is very close."
Grob says: "Hey, flip me!"
Glob says: "Okay."
Grob says: "I'm gonna activate the thingy that drains his magic juice."
Magic Man is seen glowing and in pain, along with dropping the telescope.
Magic Man says: "Whoops!"
Grob says: "I think I see him."
Grod says: "Yes, I see him as well."
Glob says: "Hey, guys?"
Other heads says: "What, Glob?"
Glob says: "..."
Glob says: "Nothing, never mind."
Magic Man pants as he runs away. The scene cuts to Finn and Jake walking through the forest.
Jake says: "Wait, wait!"
Jake says: "Shh, shh, shh!"
Jake says: "Shush!"
Finn says: "I wasn't..."
Jake says: "You hear that?"
Jake says: "It was totally silent for, like, a whole second!"
Finn says: "Huh."
Finn says: "Oh, yeah!"
Finn says: "Cool."
Jake says: "Sometimes, we get so wrapped up battling stuff, we forget the..."
Jake says: "Ooomph!"
Magic Man runs straight into the duo, knocking himself and them down. Grob Gob Glob Grod is still in pursuit.
Finn says: "Hey..."
Magic Man says: "Shhh."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "Arise."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "Magic Man."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "You caused nothing but turmoil and chaos to us on Mars."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "We hoped banishing you to this world would help you see alike to our Utopian supersociety."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "Now, tell us, what have you learned in these past two hundred years?"
Jake says: "Are you guys talking to me?"
Glob says: "You know you made life on Mars a nightmare!"
Finn wakes up.
Gob says: "Now we must return you to Mars, where vengeance awaits thee."
Grob Gob Glob Grod blasts off with Jake.
Finn says: "Magic Man!"
Finn says: "Get UP!"
Magic Man says: "Did it work?"
Magic Man says: "Is he gone?"
Finn says: "Hee-yup-hoop!"
Finn says: "They took my friend to Mars!"
Finn says: "Fly me there and help me save him!"
Finn jumps on his back.
Finn says: "What do you mean, KILL?"
Magic Man says: "They're gonna put him on trial for my crimes!"
Magic Man says: "Ain't nobody gonna pardon these crimes on my head."
Magic Man says: "Not even the King of Mars!"
Magic Man says: "And once he's dead, my magic juice will return to my body."
Magic Man says: "Flowing through me like moonlight through the ghost dance."
Finn squeezes Magic Man around the middle, still holding on.
Finn says: "SQUEEZE!!!!"
Magic Man says: "I wish I could help."
Magic Man says: "Except I don't!"
Finn says: "You succubutt!"
They arrive at the house, which is a wreck.
Finn says: "How long have you had this house?"
Magic Man says: "Yes, that is true!"
Finn says: "Well, I bet there's something in here that could help me save Jake."
Magic Man says: "There is, but you'll never make it work."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Where is it?"
Magic Man says: "I don't know!"
Magic Man says: "Have you seen my trash palace?"
Finn says: "Yeah, what's the deal?"
Finn says: "This place is wrecked."
Finn says: "Eeeew, ew!"
Finn says: "What am I stepping in??"
Magic Man says: "That's where I blow my nose all day!"
Finn says: "Ugh!"
Magic Man says: "Yes, welcome to my tower of light!"
Magic Man says: "Everyone is welcome to share this magic kingdom."
Magic Man says: "Squirrels, black mold, worms, poison ivy..."
Magic Man says: "tiny manticore!"
Tiny Manticore says: "Help me, you coward!"
Finn says: "Magic Man, what is your deal for real?"
Magic Man says: "You tell me."
Finn says: "Well, for one, I think this house is a reflection of your sick brain."
Finn says: "Look at this."
Finn says: "Yuk."
Finn says: "Who's this you're standing with in this picture?"
Magic Man says: "Memories drift in and out of my mind..."
And the little people get left behind...
So whatever!!
Finn says: "..."
Finn says: "all right."
I find what you're taking about.
Magic Man says: "It's downstairs."
Finn says: "What?"
Magic Man says: "My special thing."
Magic Man says: "Whoa!"
Magic Man says: "Aaaaagh!"
Finn says: "Holy crepes."
Magic Man says: "Aah!"
Magic Man says: "A Martian transporter."
Finn says: "This can take me to Mars?!"
Finn says: "!"
Magic Man says: "Yeah."
Magic Man says: "My brothers gave it to me when they banished me to earth."
Magic Man says: "They thought I'd learn love and use it to go back home."
Finn says: "How does it work?"
Magic Man says: "You put your hands on those thingies and think stuff about people."
Magic Man says: "But it's broken!"
Magic Man says: "Hasn't worked in 200 years."
Finn says: "But..."
Finn says: "It has to work."
Finn says: "It has to."
Magic Man says: "Huzzah??"
Finn says: "YAAAH!"
Gob says: "Citizens of Mars, King of Mars..."
Gob says: "Today the most notorious fiend in Martian history stands before usâ€”"
Gob says: "Magic Man."
Gob says: "Turn on the dark."
Gob says: "Plague of shadows."
Gob says: "Magic Man brought our shadows to life."
Gob says: "They attacked us, and ravaged Mars."
Gob says: "Very impressive, Grod."
Grod says: "Thanks bro."
Gob says: "To the plague of the oneness."
Gob says: "As we gathered to hold hands and sing our community song, Magic Man cast an evil spell that made our arms grow together."
Gob says: "Much suffering ensued."
Gob says: "And what about that one time when he turned all the water into hair, and we all got so thirsty we drank it?"
Gob says: "And when we drank it, we went bald!"
Gob says: "Many of us did not recover and to this day, hide our losses behind groovy headgear."
Abe Lincoln says: "Magic Man, it bums me out to see this."
Abe Lincoln says: "I remember when you were really cool, before that night you spent on Olympus Mons with Margles."
Finn says: "Force field."
Abe Lincoln says: "What happened, Magic?"
Abe Lincoln says: "Why did you go crazy?"
Abe Lincoln says: "If you had just learned to care about living things again, you could have come back whenever you wanted!"
Jake says: "Arf!"
Jake says: "Arf!"
Jake says: "Arf!"
Jake says: "Arf!"
Abe Lincoln says: "You sad Magic Man."
Abe Lincoln says: "Instead, you bummed around Ooo, acting like a jerk for 200 years."
Jake says: "Yeah, that's true, except I'm not Magic Man!"
Abe Lincoln says: "Now!"
Abe Lincoln says: "Ready the Wand of Disbursement!"
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "Ready."
Abe Lincoln says: "Space Dome, open!"
Finn says: "Oh snap."
Abe Lincoln says: "Magic Man, I give you two choices."
Abe Lincoln says: "One is total annihilation."
Abe Lincoln says: "The wand will touch you, and your soul will meet with Death."
Abe Lincoln says: "The second is to use the power of the wand to convert your body to living stardust, where your consciousness will be jettisoned into the infinite cosmos, on an endless journey of wonder and DISCOVERYYYYYY!!!!!"
Jake says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "That second one sounds pretty cool."
Jake says: "I mean, yeah."
Jake says: "I'm way into that."
Jake says: "Except..."
Jake says: "oh..."
Jake says: "I would really miss my best friend."
Jake says: "His name is Finn, and I think it would mess him up if I wasn't around."
Abe Lincoln says: "Wait."
Abe Lincoln says: "Did you say you would miss someone?"
Jake says: "Yeah."
Abe Lincoln says: "And that someone would miss you?"
Finn says: "Yeah that's ME, you dishrags!"
Magic Man says: "I win again, just like always!"
Finn says: "Jakey!"
Finn says: "No!"
Gob says: "Look!"
Grob says: "It's the dog!"
Grod says: "The one you were prophesied to meet!"
Finn says: "I don't care none for that mess."
Finn says: "This wouldn't have globbed if you'd just..."
Finn says: "listened to my bro!"
Finn says: "You bunked up, King of Mars!"
Finn says: "The wisest, most honest super being of all time just put an innocent dog to deads!"
Abe Lincoln says: "You're right, Finn the Human."
Abe Lincoln says: "My judgement was less than the standard by which I judge my peers."
Abe Lincoln says: "Of which I have none."
Abe Lincoln says: "I will retrieve your friend from the 37th Dead World."
Abe Lincoln says: "Death."
Death says: "King of Mars."
Death says: "What's your business?"
Abe Lincoln says: "I need this one back."
Death says: "What will you give me for him?"
Abe holds out a penny.
Death says: "Not this time, your majesty."
Abe Lincoln says: "In that case, I offer my immortality."
Death says: "Deal."
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Hey, I'm alive!"
Finn says: "Yay!"
Finn says: "King of Mars saved you!"
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "Yes, but at what cost?"
Finn and Jake look up at Abe Lincoln, who is now just a stone statue on his throne.
Finn says: "Oh, man."
Finn says: "Should we go get Magic Man?"
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "No."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "I lost a friend."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "I cannot lose my brother, as well."
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "Hey!"
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "What?"
Grob Gob Glob Grod says: "Where did he go??"
Finn says: "YAAAAH!"
Magic Man says: "Oh, Margles."
Finn says: "MAGIC MAN!"
Tiny Manticore says: "You fat coward!"
Finn says: "Go!"
Finn says: "Get out of here, tiny manticore!"
Tiny Manticore says: "Whatevs."
Tiny Manticore says: "I didn't need your pity help!"
Finn says: "Jeez."
Finn says: "What?"
Tiny Manticore says: "I am the true coward."
Tiny Manticore says: "Hiding from sincere expressions like a vampire in the nude who hides from the light."
Tiny Manticore says: "Thank you, brave hero."
Tiny Manticore says: "I was freed from bottle jail, but my new prison..."
Tiny Manticore says: "is shame."
Tiny Manticore says: "MY NEW PRISON IS SHAAAAME!!!"
Finn says: "What's he saying?"
Jake says: "He said his new prison is shame."
The episode ends.
