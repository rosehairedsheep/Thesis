Sequence in color.
Inside the Tree Fort, BMO, under a couch, plays a game on its own screen with a joystick.
BMO says: "Haha!"
BMO says: "Take that, Master Chen!"
Footsteps are heard. Finn's feet, one of them missing a sock, pass near BMO.
Finn says: "JAAAAKE!"
Jake says: "What?"
BMO notices Finn and quits playing its game. BMO sneaks up near Finn, who is rummaging through boots. Its joystick, still connected, follows him.
Finn says: "Jake, did you hide my sock?"
Jake is shown putting eyeliner and looking at a mirror.
Jake says: "I don't do that kinda stuff anymore."
Finn says: "So, what?"
Finn says: "It just magically disappeared?"
Jake says: "I don't know..."
Jake makes a spiral mark with lipstick on his face.
Jake says: "Maybe."
Finn gets up and walks towards Jake.
Finn says: "Is that just a cute way of saying you took it?"
Jake says: "No!"
Finn says: "Why don't you just help me find my sock?"
Jake says: "Oh, Finn lost his sock!"
Jake says: "Everybody stop what you're doing and help Finn find his precious sock!"
Film turns to black and white as BMO performs its action.
BMO, having watched the conversation, pulls out its joystick cable and steps on it, twisting its foot like it's putting out a cigarette. A cigarette burn is heard. Jazz music begins to play. Finn and Jake's voices get silent.
BMO says: "It looked like a tough case to crack."
BMO says: "But I hate to see good friends fight."
Zoom to BMO's face lighted in the eye region.
BMO says: "So I decided to take the case."
Finn and Jake leave, but a flash reveals that BMO has taken a photo. He picks up the polaroid and looks at it.
Cut to the picture. A mouse rests next to Finn's foot.
BMO says: "Ronnie!"
BMO pulls down the picture, revealing Ronnie, who looks at it and runs away.
BMO says: "It looked like I had a guilty mouse."
BMO runs towards where Ronnie ran. A chase scene ensues. Ronnie climbs up the wood structure of the Tree Fort.
BMO sees a hole in a tree nearby.
BMO says: "Huh!"
BMO dives into the hole. Ronnie climbs down the wood structure and heads to the table, but BMO traps him.
BMO says: "Hello, Ronnie."
BMO sticks out its hand at Ronnie's lips and moves them.
BMO says: "What do you want, BMO?"
BMO releases its hand out of Ronnie's lips. Ronnie lifts his head up.
BMO says: "Where is Finn's sock?"
BMO says: "I don't know what you're talking about, BMO."
BMO says: "I didn't do nothin'."
BMO says: "Leave me alone!"
Ronnie puts his head down, revealing a lipstick smudge on the back of his neck. Zoom to the smudge. BMO's face is lighted.
BMO says: "How is Lorraine?"
Ronnie turns his head at BMO.
BMO says: "You stay away from her!"
BMO says: "She is with me now, do you hear?"
BMO says: "Calm down, big guy."
BMO says: "Me and Lorraine are dinosaur bones."
BMO says: "Good, 'cause I would be so jealous."
BMO shows its picture to Ronnie, who looks at it.
BMO says: "Just tell me where the sock is, and I will let you go."
Zoom to the picture and Ronnie.
BMO says: "I don't know, man."
BMO shakes its fist and leans towards him.
BMO says: "What if I put some knuckle in your eyeballs?"
BMO says: "Would that help you think?"
BMO says: "Ok!"
BMO says: "Ok!"
BMO says: "Umm..."
BMO grabs Ronnie's arm and points to Finn's foot, where a stain is seen.
BMO says: "It looks like a grape juice stain on his sock; check the pantry."
BMO says: "Maybe the grape juice had some secrets to tell me."
BMO says: "Or maybe Ronnie was just pulling my hair."
BMO says: "Just as I thought, not even opened."
BMO says: "I fell right into his trap."
BMO says: "Officer Davis!"
BMO says: "Thank goodness."
BMO says: "I..."
BMO says: "BMO, what are you doing here?"
BMO says: "Looking for Finn's socks, same as you."
BMO says: "We got this to under control."
BMO says: "Stay out of police business, or you will be the one behind bars."
BMO says: "She looked as beautiful as ever."
BMO says: "Where is the sock, Lorraine?"
BMO says: "What makes you think I know?"
BMO says: "I saw your lipstick on his fur, so don't act so cute."
BMO says: "Sounds like someone's jealous, no?"
BMO says: "Don't count on it, Lorraine."
BMO says: "Now tell me where Ronnie is."
BMO says: "Ha!"
BMO says: "You think it was Ronnie?"
BMO says: "Maybe if he was man enough to steal a sock, I wouldn't have to spend my nights with Bebe."
BMO says: "Bebe?"
BMO says: "So you're saying Bebe is man enough?"
BMO says: "What?"
BMO says: "No, you're putting words in my mouth."
BMO says: "Bebe doesn't know anything about Finn's sock."
BMO says: "Finn's sock?"
BMO says: "How did you know it was Finn's sock?"
BMO says: "I never said whose sock was stolen, Lorraine."
BMO says: "Uh..."
BMO says: "uh..."
BMO says: "I heard it on the TV news."
BMO says: "No dice, sweet beak."
BMO says: "Officer Davis has this case under tight wraps."
BMO says: "Oh, fine, Bebe stole the sock."
BMO says: "Oh, BMO, can't you just forget about it?"
BMO says: "Sorry, lady, forgetting ain't in my job description."
BMO says: "Ha ha ha!"
BMO says: "Does that mean you still remember..."
BMO says: "us?"
BMO says: "..."
BMO says: "Hahaha!"
BMO says: "Same old Lorraine."
BMO says: "Well, don't tell Ronnie about me and Bebe."
Scene changes.
BMO says: "He yells at ladies!"
BMO approaches Bebe and then puts its foot on one of Bebe's buttons.
BMO says: "Wake up, brainiac."
BMO says: "BMO?"
BMO says: "Uh..."
BMO says: "uh..."
BMO says: "auh!"
BMO says: "Where is the sock, Bebe?"
BMO says: "Uh..."
BMO says: "I don't know nothing about socks!"
BMO says: "Don't play dumb, Bebe!"
BMO says: "Don't play dumb with me!"
BMO says: "I talked to Lorraine, Bebe."
BMO says: "She sold you out, dumb dumb!"
BMO says: "No!"
BMO says: "She-she wouldn't do that!"
BMO says: "It wasn't me, I swear!"
BMO says: "It was Ronnie!"
BMO says: "Ronnie?"
BMO says: "But why?"
BMO says: "I don't know, man!"
BMO says: "I don't know!"
BMO says: "I'm gonna go wash this shmutz off my grabbers."
BMO says: "When I get back, you better start talking sense!"
BMO walks away and scene changes to BMO at the sink.
BMO says: "Sure, he's a dirt bag born out of a mother, but who's not?"
BMO says: "I don't really get it."
BMO says: "Maybe it was time to cut my losses."
Scene changes to BMO walking back to Bebe with some toilet paper.
BMO says: "Come on, Bebe, let's get you cleaned up."
BMO says: "Bebe?"
Zoom to Bebe, upside down, with his case and batteries out.
BMO says: "Bebe!"
BMO says: "Dead."
BMO says: "This doesn't look good."
BMO says: "I'd better hightail it!"
BMO drops the toilet paper and starts to run in the other direction, but then hears a meow offscreen, he turns to see Officer Meow, and Lieutenant Whiskers approaching him.
BMO says: "Huh?"
BMO says: "The cops!"
BMO says: "?"
BMO says: "It was a setup!"
BMO says: "Bang, bang!"
BMO says: "Pew, pew, pew!"
BMO stops in front of Officer Davis who meows at BMO who then starts running in the opposite direction. BMO keeps running until Lieutenant Whiskers trips BMO who then falls down the ladder into the Tree Fort's treasure room, breaks two spokes on the ladder, falls to the floor, and passes out and BMO starts dreaming.
Jake says: "Hey, has anyone seen BMO?"
Jake says: "BMO?"
Jake says: "Where's BMO?"
BMO says: "Hello?"
BMO says: "With the lipstick, she looked as beautiful as ever."
BMO turns around in a dark room with a barred window.
Finn says: "I'm worried about BMO."
BMO punches its mirror at the sink and smashes it.
The animation of a hand putting lipstick on Lorraine is replayed, backwards.
BMO says: "This is real."
Jake says: "BMO!"
BMO says: "Who's BMO?"
A hand, covered in soot takes off Bebe's battery cover.
BMO turns around again in the dark room but with a different face that has eyeballs, eyelashes, a nose, lips, and facial hair.
Different BMO says: "Hello."
BMO opens its eyes as it hears Neptr.
Neptr says: "Hello?"
Neptr says: "Hello?"
Neptr says: "Hello?"
Neptr says: "Hey, BMO."
Neptr says: "Wake up, buddy."
Neptr says: "Are you alright?"
BMO says: "Neptr?"
BMO says: "I feel like I got hit with a Dracula by King Kong."
Neptr says: "Whoa, sorry, man."
Neptr says: "You want some pie or something?"
BMO says: "Sorry, I gotta run."
BMO says: "The cops are after me."
BMO says: "Have you seen any down here?"
Neptr says: "Nah, no one's been down here all day except me, you, and Ronnie."
BMO says: "What?!"
BMO says: "!"
BMO says: "What was Ronnie doing down here?!"
BMO says: "!"
Neptr says: "I don't know, but now my sensors indicate that some treasure is missing..."
Neptr says: "about a sock's worth."
BMO says: "That's it!"
BMO says: "That's why Ronnie took the sock: To carry stolen treasure in with!"
BMO says: "He had to whack Bebe to keep him from squealing, then he pinned the rap on me."
Neptr says: "Bebe's dead?"
BMO says: "Listen, Neptr: you better lay low for awhile."
BMO says: "I'm gonna go find Ronnie."
BMO says: "I've got a score to settle."
Neptr says: "Hey, BMO."
Neptr says: "We should hang out more."
Neptr says: "We're both robots."
BMO says: "No, Neptr."
BMO says: "I am not like you."
BMO sneaks upstairs to find the outline of a rat and ketchup in the center.
BMO says: "Ronnie?"
BMO says: "Evening, BMO."
BMO falls back, surprised.
BMO says: "Don't worry, buddy."
BMO says: "You're off the hook."
BMO says: "We know it was Ronnie who killed Bebe and snatched the treasure."
BMO says: "We found this confession on him after the shootout."
Officer Davis hands BMO a piece of paper with random scribbles on it.
BMO says: "Hmmmmm..."
BMO says: "what about the sock?"
BMO says: "Forget the sock, BMO."
BMO says: "The case is closed."
BMO says: "Let it go, buddy."
BMO says: "It's over."
BMO says: "Maybe he was right."
BMO says: "But I just couldn't shake the feeling that, somehow, this case had slipped right through my fingers."
BMO runs outside to find Lorraine on a barrel, next to a socks-worth of treasure.
BMO says: "Lorraine!"
BMO says: "BMO?"
BMO says: "Get back here with that treasure, Lorraine!"
BMO says: "Sorry, BMO."
BMO says: "I earned this loot."
BMO says: "Those chumps were not framing themselves."
BMO says: "See you around, BMO."
BMO says: "Lorraine, wait!"
BMO says: "What about the sock, Lorraine?"
BMO says: "Oh, that old thing?"
BMO says: "I hid that where no one would ever find it: in our secret, grown-up kissing spot."
BMO says: "Remember?"
BMO laughs and blushes.
BMO says: "It was good to see you again, BMO."
BMO says: "Till next time."
Lorraine jumps off the barrel onto land and runs away.
BMO says: "Till next time, Lorraine."
Finn and Jake come home, Finn carrying his Sea Lard.
Jake says: "Ya see, man?"
Jake says: "That was really fun."
Jake says: "You don't need two socks to have fun."
Finn says: "Yeah, I guess."
Finn says: "But maybe it woulda been more fun with two socks!"
BMO says: "Finn, Finn!"
BMO says: "I know where your sock is!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
BMO says: "It was in your pillow this whole time!"
BMO says: "See?"
Finn says: "Whoa haha!"
Finn says: "Right on, BMO!"
BMO says: "Ronnie the mouse stole it, but Lorraine chicken set him up to kill Bebe, but the flatfoot busted Ronnie, and Lorraine skedaddled with the loot, but BMO solved the case!"
Finn says: "Yay, BMO!"
Finn says: "Yay!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
BMO says: "Yay, BMO!"
Finn says: "Yay!"
BMO says: "Yay, BMO!"
Jake says: "Our chicken's name is Lorraine?"
BMO says: "She's red hot like pizza supper."
The episode ends.
