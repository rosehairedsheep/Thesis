The episode begins in Ice King's castle. Clothing is all over the floor and Ice King's dresser drawers are open. Gunter is standing nearby.
Ice King says: "Ach!"
Ice King says: "Where the turd is my Demonic Wishing Eye?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Ice King says: "Grrrr..."
Ice King says: "I've looked everywhere!"
Ice King says: "Ugh..."
Gunter says: "Wenk!"
Ice King says: "What is it, girl?"
Gunter says: "Wenk."
Ice King says: "You know where it is?"
Ice King says: "Lead the way!"
Ice King says: "Oh boy, this is just wonderful!"
Ice King says: "Ah, princesses only."
Ice King says: "No Gunthers!"
Gunter covers his head.
Ice King says: "W-I-Z-..."
Ice King types out the rest of WIZARD MARKET. Magic Wishing Eye is shown onscreen. Gunter blocks the light to the holographic screen.
Ice King says: "Hey!"
Ice King says: "You're really peeving me off, Gunther!"
Ice King says: "Go stand in the corner!"
Gunter jumps off the computer desk and slides into the corner, belly down.
Ice King says: "I said stand in the corner."
Gunter scoots himself up the wall a bit, still partially lying down.
Ice King says: "Ugh."
Ice King says: "You make me sick."
Ice King says: "Try not to break anything while I'm gone."
Ice King flies out. Gunter sheds a tear, walks over to the entrance, and squints while watching Ice King fly away. Gunter walks over to the refrigerator, opens it, and starts breaking the bottles inside. After realizing that there are none left to break, Gunter slides over to a chair and pulls the lever for the foot rest, revealing a compartment. In it is Kitten, whom Gunter brings out, and a box, which Gunter opens. Inside is the Demonic Wishing Eye, which Gunter dons.
The scene changes to inside the Tree Fort, where Finn wakes up to find a green penguin on his stomach.
Finn says: "Jake?"
Finn says: "We gots penguins."
Jake says: "thanks..."
Finn says: "Come on, you guys!"
Finn says: "Get off me, now."
Finn says: "Wah!"
Finn says: "Wah!"
Finn says: "Grah!"
Penguins says: "Wah!"
Penguins says: "Wah!"
Penguins says: "Grah!"
Finn says: "Jake?"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Oh..."
Jake says: "this is unusual."
Finn gasps for air as he escapes from under a giant penguin. The penguins start slapping and pommeling Jake. Finn jumps on top of one's head and Finn and Jake start punching them. They fall downstairs into the living room with the penguins still on top of them. The penguins continue slapping them.
Finn says: "Glip..."
Finn says: "driggle!"
Jake says: "Eh..."
Jake says: "What's with these super penguins?"
Finn says: "I don't know!"
Finn says: "I'm guessing it's the Ice King."
Jake says: "Well, where is he, then?"
Finn says: "ICE KIIIIING!"
Scene changes, showing Ice King flying in a canyon toward a wall.
Ice King says: "Wizards rule."
The wall disappears, revealing Wizard City. Ice King lands near a shop.
Ice King says: "Hey, this is the magic items shop, right?"
Huntress Wizard says: "What's it look like, ya donk?"
Ice King says: "I know that, I know!"
Ice King says: "Why can't they write it on the sign, though?"
Ice King says: "Why's it all gotta be secret?"
Ice King says: "Let's just put it all out there, huh?"
Ice King says: "Equal distribution of magic to the people!"
Ice King says: "Ya feelin' me, Huntress Wizard?"
Huntress Wizard says: "You tryin' to get killed, Ice King?"
Ice King says: "Uh-uh, I was just steppin' to ya, girl, with my intellectual wizard politics."
Ice King says: "Hello?"
Bufo says: "..."
Bufo says: "So then he was telling me to beef in the eye of Glob and stuff."
Laser Wizard says: "Whoa."
Laser Wizard says: "Did you do it?"
Bufo says: "Heck yes, I did."
Forest Wizard says: "Yo, I wouldn't do that."
Laser Wizard says: "Get over it, man."
Laser Wizard says: "Don't you want to reach the highest initiation of the secret schools?"
Forest Wizard says: "Of course, man."
Forest Wizard says: "In shadow, we find the light..."
Forest Wizard says: "safely sealed in darkest night."
Forest Wizard says: "So make sure y'all keep it tight."
Forest Wizard says: "Wizards only, fools."
Ice King says: "Keep what tight?"
Laser Wizard says: "A secret you never should've heard, Ice King."
Ice King says: "Just get me a new one and I'll jet."
Ice King says: "I didn't hear nothin' about no weird, secret wizard club that I want to be a part of."
Forest Wizard says: "Loose lips sink the ships, Ice King."
Bufo says: "Sorry, man."
Bufo says: "Nothing personal."
Ice King says: "Oh, slid—"
Ice King says: "Whoa!"
Scene changes back to Tree Fort, where several penguins are sitting on Jake.
Jake says: "Okay, I give up."
Gunter opens the door, levitating with the Demonic Wishing Eye. Kitten is strapped to his back.
Finn says: "Gunther?!"
Jake says: "Gunther?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Nice ice!"
Finn says: "What's goin' on here, man?"
Finn says: "Call off your super bros."
Gunter stops levitating and knocks some bottles off a shelf. They shatter on the floor.
Jake says: "Well, that's great."
Finn says: "Where's the Ice King, Gunther?"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn and Jake run outside, finding hundreds of penguins scattered around their fort.
Finn says: "WHAAAA!"
Jake says: "WHAAAA!"
Finn says: "Is this happening everywhere?"
Jake says: "I don't know—"
Jake says: "lemme see."
Jake says: "Dang!"
Finn says: "What do ya see?"
Jake says: "Hold on."
Jake says: "Oh no!"
Jake says: "NO!"
Finn says: "What, dude?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Hold on, man."
Jake says: "Wait."
Jake says: "Oh, Glob!"
Jake says: "This can't be happening!"
Finn says: "Tell me!"
Jake says: "Eh, it's over."
Jake says: "We've been conquered."
Finn says: "Who's been conquered?"
Jake says: "Everyone."
Finn says: "By the Ice King?"
Jake says: "No, dude!"
Jake says: "By Gunther."
Finn says: "Holy shmow!"
Finn says: "Gimme that!"
Finn says: "Hurry, Jake!"
Finn says: "Wait—"
Finn says: "I'm still in my pajayjays."
Jake turns around and the scene changes to Finn wearing his normal outfit. Finn is riding on Jake, who is running towards the Candy Kingdom. Finn whips out a holographic tablet phone and calls a number.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yo, Finn, are you seeing these penguins?"
Finn says: "Yeah, it's Gunther!"
Finn says: "He's taking over the whole thing!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Well, he'll have to beat my Banana Guards and my Gumball Guardians."
Jake says: "That's not gonna work."
Princess Bubblegum says: "What did he say?"
Finn says: "He says your plan is bunk."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Well, what's your plan?"
Finn says: "I got a plan."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You do?"
Finn says: "When we get there, I'll do my plan in addition to your plan."
Finn says: "Two plans."
Finn says: "Laters."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Uh, alright, so you're not gonna tell me your—"
Finn says: "I'm outies!"
Jake says: "You're not gonna tell her the plan?"
Finn says: "No, I gotta be mysterious."
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "I thought you weren't into Bubblegum anymore."
Finn says: "I'm not."
Finn says: "But this is how I act now with all the ladies, you see?"
Finn says: "I keep 'em in a state of confusion."
Finn says: "That way, I've always got options in case Flame Princess doesn't work out."
Jake says: "OH MY GOSH!"
Jake says: "Where is this coming from?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "It's called "future farming."
Finn says: "" I read it in that book you have by Jay T."
Finn says: "Doggzone."
Jake says: "Jay T."
Jake says: "Dogg—"
Jake says: "awww, dude!"
Jake says: "Don't read that book!"
Jake says: "It's gonna mess up your brain."
Jake says: "I keep that book around for laughs."
Jake says: "It's all really bad advice."
Finn says: "Oh, okay."
Finn says: "I'll stop it, then."
Jake says: "No, well..."
Jake says: "you can still be mysterious—"
Jake says: "that's fine."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "Now I'm confused."
Jake says: "Never mind—"
Jake says: "I didn't say nothin'."
Finn says: "Hey P-Bubs!"
Finn says: "Are you ready?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yes."
Princess Bubblegum says: "The calvary  is standing by."
Finn says: "Cool."
Finn says: "I'm gonna rally some citizens and do this other plan."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Okay, but what—"
Princess Bubblegum says: "?"
Finn says: "Good luck!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Jake, what's with all the mystery?"
Jake says: "Uhhh..."
Jake says: "Oh snap, look out!"
A wave of penguins formed into unicorns is seen charging toward them.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Banana Guards, defend!"
Banana Guards charge out on pink jellybeans. The penguins run them over.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Aw, jeez."
Gumball Guardian says: "aaah!"
Gunter floats toward the Candy Kingdom, several penguins follow while quacking.
Princess Bubblegum says: "You'll never get past these walls..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I think."
Kitten flies into the air and floats over the walls while shooting fireballs, knocking a hole in the wall.
Gunter walks into the Candy Kingdom and coughs as the smoke clears. He rubs his eyes and sees a pile of hundreds of glass bottles.
Finn says: "This..."
Finn says: "is my plan."
Finn says: "I got the Candy Kingdom underground to help me collect all the bottles in the land."
Gunter starts smashing bottles. Shards of glass shower everywhere.
Jake says: "Breaking news: that mystery plan of yours is a smash hit."
Jake says: "Because the—"
Jake says: "of the glass..."
Jake says: "I guess all they care about is bottles, huh."
Princess Bubblegum says: "But what'll happen when they run out of bottles?"
Finn says: "I won't let that happen, Prubbs."
Smashing sounds stop. The pile of bottles is now a pile of broken glass. Gunter looks around and doesn't see any more bottles.
Gunter says: "We-e-e-e-e-enk..."
Other penguins quack the same way and they advance on Finn, Jake, and Princess Bubblegum.
Finn says: "Stay back!"
Demonic Wishing Eye glows, other penguins take out swords from their beaks and start waving them.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Wait a minute!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Put away your weapons and we'll get you more bottles."
Finn says: "Peeb!"
Finn says: "There aren't any bottles left!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I have a third plan."
Scene changes, showing Finn, Jake, and Princess Bubblegum picking up the shards from the broken bottles and reassembling them.
Jake says: "So, we make them new bottles."
Jake says: "Then the Gunthers break the bottles, and then we pick up the glass and make new bottles again?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yup."
Finn says: "What, like, forever?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yes."
Finn says: "Bubb, your plan..."
Finn says: "bunks."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Heh, yeah."
Jake says: "I like it."
Jake says: "I got a rhythm goin'!"
Gunter says: "Wenk!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "What?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "What do you want?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I don't—"
Finn says: "He wants to smash the Gumball Guardian's head!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "We're going to make more bottles."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Just wait, okay?"
Gunter uses the Demonic Wishing Eye to make the penguin giants push the Gumball Guardians downward.
Finn says: "NO!"
Jake says: "NO!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "NO!"
Gumball Guardian says: "Goodbye..."
Gumball Guardian says: "Princess!"
Gunter walks up and taps on the Gumball Guardian's head. It cracks a little. Ice King flies in.
Ice King says: "Hey."
Ice King says: "What's goin' on here?"
Ice King says: "Why's this place all crazy?"
Ice King says: "I was just flying by and—"
Ice King says: "Gunther!"
Ice King says: "You took my stuff!"
Gunter says: "Wenk."
Ice King says: "That's bad."
Ice King says: "You know what you get now?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Gunter says: "Wenk."
Ice King says: "That's right, you get the squirty-squirts."
Ice King says: "Bad, bad."
Ice King says: "Now take off my Demonic Wishing Eye."
Gunter takes off the Demonic Wishing Eye and the other penguins disappear.
Ice King says: "Alright, Gunther."
Ice King says: "Now go home."
Gunter says: "Wenk."
Ice King says: "That's right, walk."
Ice King says: "And while you're walking home, you think about what you did."
Ice King says: "It's getting worse and worse with him."
Ice King says: "He just—"
Ice King says: "he hates it when I leave the castle."
Ice King says: "I'm sorry, guys."
Jake says: "Uh, dude?"
Jake says: "Where have you been?"
Finn says: "Yeah, and why are you all jacked up?"
Ice King says: "Heh..."
Ice King says: "well, I got into some crazy wiz biz over in Wizard City."
Ice King says: "Honestly, I don't even know how I survived."
Ice King says: "Basically, it was the craziest showdown ever."
Ice King says: "I—"
Ice King says: "I wish I could tell you all about it, but you know—"
Ice King says: ""Wizards only, fools."
Ice King says: "" Keep it tight."
Episode ends.
