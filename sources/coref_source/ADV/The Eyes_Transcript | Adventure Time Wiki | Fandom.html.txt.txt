Finn says: "Man, why am I so sleepy?"
Jake says: "Dude, we've been up for like seven days."
Finn says: "For real-sies?"
Jake says: "Yeah, for real-sies!"
Jake says: "Remember?"
Jake says: "First, we rescued the Slime Princess from the Ghost Ship Vortex."
Jake says: "And then we slayed that fire dragon."
Jake says: "And that took a couple of days."
Finn says: "Then we went to LSP's quinceañera."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "Oh, no way."
Lumpy Space Princess says: "You guys made it!"
Jake says: "Helped Peppermint Butler with his Goblin problem."
Peppermint Butler says: "I swear that I found it like this."
Peppermint Butler says: "I don't know what happened."
Finn says: "We'll take care of it, Peppermint Butler."
Finn says: "We rescued Wildberry Princess from the Ice King."
Jake punches Ice King and joins Wildberry Princess for a ride with Finn on Jake.
Ice King says: "I just wanna be happy!"
Jake says: "Then, we captured that Bandito."
Sheriff says: "Thanks, you guys."
Jake says: "Saved the house..."
Man says: "Thanks, you guys."
Jake says: "And fed that duck."
Duck quacks.
Flashback ends.
Jake says: "We've had a busy week."
Finn says: "I'm exhausted."
Finn says: "But happy!"
Jake says: "Good night, buddy."
Finn says: "Good night!"
Finn says: "Hey, Jake?"
Jake says: "Yeah?"
Finn says: "Can you sleep?"
Jake says: "No."
Finn says: "I can't sleep either."
Jake says: "Yeah, what's going on with that?"
Finn says: "I don't know."
Finn says: "But, I've got the strangest feeling..."
Finn says: "that we're being watched."
Finn and Jake look outside the window, and on a nearby hill, a big fat horse is staring at them.
Finn says: "Why is that horse staring at us?"
The screen does two close-ups on the horse.
Finn says: "That's super creepy."
Jake says: "Man, I just wanna go to sleep."
Finn says: "Well, maybe he's gone."
Jake says: "Not gonna be able to sleep with that horse watchin' me."
Finn says: "Let's just close the shade."
Finn closes the blinds.
Jake says: "Outta sight and outta mind."
Jake says: "See 'ya in the morning, pal."
He looks at the window, with the blinds down.
The moon shines above the horse, casting its shadow through the blinds, startling Finn.
Finn says: "Ahh!"
Finn says: "Why won't it stop?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "All right, man."
Jake says: "Let's just go..."
Jake says: "push it off that hill or something."
Finn says: "Maybe we can just..."
Finn says: "politely ask it to leave."
They go outside and talk to the horse.
Jake says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "Get out of here, horse!"
Jake says: "I want to go to sleep, and you're creeping me the math out!"
Finn says: "Whoa, man!"
Finn says: "Let me try, diplomat style."
Finn says: "Pardon me horse, I beseech thou to split from mine land, this night."
Finn says: "But I welcome thee to come back for some luncheth, some other day."
Finn says: "Okay?"
The horse's pupils dilate then contract.
Jake says: "Forget it, man."
Jake says: "This horse is whack."
Jake says: "It's got poo-brain."
Finn says: "Okay, you're right."
Finn says: "We can try pushing it, now."
Both try to push, but it's no use.
Finn says: "Move, horsey!"
Finn says: "Good Grod, Jake!"
Finn says: "Are you even pulling?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "I'm super-pulling!"
Finn says: "This horse has a ridiculous weight!"
They stop.
Finn says: "Math this."
Finn says: "What now, man."
Jake says: "I didn't wanna have to use my powers on you, horse, because I'm so sleepy."
Jake says: "But you've pushed Jake too far!"
Jake grows big, grabs the horse, and puts it on another hill.
Giant Jake says: "RAAAAHH!"
Giant Jake says: "AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!"
Finn says: "You shouldn't creep us out from way over there!"
Jake says: "Let's get back to bed, buddy."
Finn says: "Oh yeah, I'm so ready for bed."
Jake says: "I wanna marry my bed."
Finn says: "Me too!"
The sounds of hoofs beating the ground in the background; Finn turns around, and the horse is back.
Jake says: "No more..."
Jake says: "."
Jake says: "NO MORE!"
Finn says: "Where are you going?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "I have an idea!"
Jake says: "I did it!"
Jake says: "Ha-ha!"
Jake says: "He can't stare at us if he's blind!"
Finn says: "Look, man."
The horse's eyes are sticking out from under the blindfold.
Jake says: "Wh.."
Jake says: "why?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Stupid blindfold!"
Jake says: "What's your deal, screwy?!"
Jake says: "!"
Jake says: "Why are you messin' with us, huh?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "That horse is whack with poo-brain."
Jake says: "Yeah, I know, Finn."
Jake says: "I diagnosed this horse with whacked out poo-brain five minutes ago."
Finn says: "Dude, poo-brain means we can lure it away from here using music."
Finn says: "Everything brainless likes music."
Jake says: "That's true!"
Jake says: "You're a genius!"
Jake says: "Follow me, Horsey."
Finn says: "Jake?"
Finn says: "It's not luring!"
Jake says: "Huh!"
Jake says: "Hmmm."
Finn says: "Huh?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake starts luring snakes, Finn starts to scream and run towards Jake.
Finn says: "Ha!"
Finn says: "Stop!"
Finn says: "You're luring snakes!"
Finn says: "STOP!!"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Oh, nuts."
Jake says: "Let me try and lure a mongoose!"
Finn says: "Stop man!"
Jake says: "No!"
Jake says: "Ahh!"
Jake says: "Dude..."
Jake says: "let's kill the horse."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "I'm so tired, Finn!"
Finn says: "No, man, we're not killing the horse."
Jake says: "Okay, we won't kill the horse."
Jake says: "We'll dress him up like a bunny!"
Jake says: "Ha-ha!"
Jake says: "And get a giant hawk—"
Jake says: "Caaaww!"
Jake says: "--To kill him!"
Finn says: "Wah?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "Caaawww!"
Jake says: "Caaawwwwww!"
Finn says: "No, man!"
Finn says: "That is wrong."
Jake says: "Eh."
Jake says: "Did I say that the hawk would kill him?"
Jake says: "I meant that the hawk would swoop down gently and take him away to an island of sunshine and love-stuff and, take care of him."
Finn says: "Whoa."
Finn says: "That sounds awesome."
They put the bunny ears on the head and the bunny tail on the horse.
Jake says: "What do think?"
Finn says: "It looks like a bunny?"
Jake whistles.
Both says: "Hey Come and get it hawk, let's go!"
They run and scream like crazy.
Finn says: "Hey Jake, I think I see a hawk or two."
Finn says: "Cause more commotion to help the hawks!"
Both says: "Ahhh!"
Both says: "Blblblblblblblblblbl!"
Both says: "Take the bunny!"
Finn says: "Hey, there they are!"
Finn says: "They see our commotions!"
Both says: "Riiiiiighhhhhht here!"
Both says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Grab a good hold and fly away!"
Two hawks swoop down to the horse, and start to peck the two on the head.
Finn says: "The bunny!"
Finn says: "The bunny!"
The two hawks take the "bunny" away.
Finn says: "What a beautiful sight."
Both says: "We did it!"
Both says: "Back to sleep!"
They both hop into bed.
Finn says: "Good night, buddy."
Jake says: "Good night, buddy."
Without warning, the horse falls through the roof.
Finn says: "Ahh!"
Finn says: "It's in our house now!"
Jake says: "That's obvious, Finn!"
Jake says: "You don't have to say that out loud!"
Finn says: "Hey, this is all your fault, dude!"
Finn says: "If you weren't so darn handsome, animals wouldn't always be staring at you!"
Jake says: "You're just mad at me for being..."
Jake says: "handsome?"
Jake says: "Well, you're the one who told me to lure snakes!"
Jake says: "Ahhh!"
Finn says: "I told you to lure the horse!"
Finn says: "You lured the snakes!"
Finn says: "There's even one here in my underpants!"
Finn says: "It's tearing us apart."
Jake says: "Aw, man.."
Jake says: "you're right!"
Jake says: "We have to get rid of this horse, for us!"
Finn says: "I know, bro."
Finn says: "I know."
Jake says: "Oh, Finn; this horse is bringing us together now."
Jake says: "This horse is a blessing."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Dude, you've lost it!"
Jake says: "You..."
Jake says: "wait, wait."
Jake says: "The horse is tearing us apart again!"
Finn says: "You're right!"
Finn says: "It's about time I show this horse who's the man."
Jake says: "What are you going to do?"
Finn says: "Say that to me again."
Jake says: "What are you going to do?!"
Jake says: "!"
Finn says: "Do..."
Finn says: "Doo-doo."
Finn says: "I'm going to kick that horse in the bottom!"
Jake says: "Oh, my Grod!"
Finn kicks the horse, and the Ice King flies out.
Finn says: "The Ice King?!"
Jake says: "The Ice King?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "!"
Ice King says: "I should go."
Finn says: "You were spying on us?!"
Finn says: "!"
Ice King says: "That's none of your business!"
Jake says: "He was trying to learn our bedtime secrets!"
Finn says: "Were you?"
Ice King pulls a cork out of the "horse," revealing it was a costume.
Jake says: "He was!"
Jake says: "Did you find out that I sleep "in the nude"?"
Ice King humming.
Jake says: "It's none of your business how nude I sleep, Ice King!"
Jake says: "Nnnnone of your business!"
Ice King says: "Gentlemen, I'll see you later."
Both says: "Hmph!"
Ice King leaves the room and heads toward the door but Finn kicks him out when he's just about to get outside. Ice King hisses and uses ice magic as Jake comes out of the house with a sword in his hands.
Jake says: "Here's your sword, dude!"
Finn says: "Thank you."
Ice King and Finn fight until he kicks Finn's sword away while Jake fell momentarily asleep against the wall.
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Look out!"
Jake jumps to avoid the sword. Jake bounces on the sword that got stuck in the wall and aims at the Ice King.
Jake says: "Tell us why you were spying!"
Ice King says: "NO!"
Ice King throws Finn in the air and ends up running into Jake, both hit the ground.
Finn says: "Snakes!"
Jake says: "Quick!"
Jake says: "Throw them to the Ice King!"
Finn says: "What's he doing?"
Jake says: "He's using his ice powers."
Blocks of ice that came out flying from the fridge hit Finn and Jake.
Finn says: "Ow!"
Jake says: "Ow!"
Finn says: "Ouch!"
Jake says: "Ouch!"
Finn says: "Ow!"
Jake says: "Ow!"
Finn says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "Hey!"
Finn says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "Hey!"
Ice King says: "Is that all the ice ya have?"
Finn says: "Yeeesss!"
Ice King says: "Well, you should really have more."
Finn says: "We don't need any more."
Ice King says: "What if you had guests?"
Finn says: "Guests bring their own ice."
Finn slaps the Ice King causing him to lose his crown. Both fight until Finn kicks the Ice King and he hits the wall making the sword fall on his beard. Finn and Jake run and grab the sword.
Finn says: "Tell us why you're watchin' us or we'll - we'll cut off your stupid head."
Jake says: "Yeah and make it quick 'cause we're both really sleepy."
Ice King says: "Ok, ok, I'll tell you!"
Ice King says: "I was watching you..."
Ice King says: "to learn how to be happy."
Finn says: "What?"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Finn and Jake let go of Ice King.
Ice King says: "It's true!"
Ice King says: "I would like to be happy like you guys."
Ice King says: "But, I have no idea how."
Jake says: "So, you dressed up like a horse?"
Ice King says: "Have pity on me."
Ice King says: "I've been so sad and miserable, I cry all the time."
Ice King says: "But, whenever I see you two, you always look so happy."
Ice King says: "But, they're just hopping over each other."
Ice King says: "So yes, I've decided to spy on you, dressed as a horse."
Ice King says: "But, I guess my plan failed."
Ice King says: "All I observed was you two arguing over..."
Ice King says: "how to get rid of me."
Finn and Jake snore.
Ice King says: "Hey, are you sleeping?"
Silent moment.
Ice King says: "Ahh..."
Ice King says: "I'm..."
Ice King says: "still not happy."
