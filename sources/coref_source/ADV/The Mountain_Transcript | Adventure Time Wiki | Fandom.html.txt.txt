In Castle Lemongrab, Lemongrab is seated at a table with some of his subjects. A waiter serves up some Lemonjons.
Lemongrab says: "Commence dinner."
Everyone at the table eats a spoonful of Lemonjons simultaneously.
Lemongrab says: "Dinner is concluded."
Lemongrab says: "Up."
His subjects carry him to his room bucket brigade-style, passing him one to the other over their heads. They drop him off at his window and leave in a hurry. Lemongrab watches his subjects harvest bunches of Lemonjons from a tree and drop them into a machine that separates them. The machine spits them out one at a time onto a conveyor belt, where they are then smashed with wooden mallets by more workers. The smashed bits are scooped into bags, then sown into a tilled field. Nearby, a Lemon Person is constructing a statue of Lemongrab out of lemon concrete.
Lemon Person says: "Ooh!"
Lemongrab says: "Mm."
Lemongrab says: "Lights out!"
All the workers collapse at their posts and immediately fall asleep. Lemongrab is carried into bed by his subjects. They place a baseball mitt on Lemongrab's right hand and a bag of Lemonjons on his nightstand, then turn out the light. Lemongrab gazes up at the ceiling at a mural depicting Matthew and the obstacles leading up to him. The ceiling cracks a little.
Lemongrab says: "Huh?!"
Lemongrab says: "!"
A bit of the ceiling falls on Lemongrab's bed, leaving a small hole in the mural. A bug-like Lemon creature crawls out of it, and a low, distant roar sounds. Lemongrab gets stressed and grabs the bag of Lemonjons off his nightstand. He leaves his castle on his Lemon Camel.
Lemongrab says: "Bye."
The gatekeepers close the gate and collapse back to sleep. On a mountain, Finn is lying on his back with a telescope, and Jake is preparing something over a campfire.
Finn says: "Better get up here, Jake."
Finn says: "It's about to happen."
Jake says: "Coming!"
Jake says: "Just gotta get this cocoa pipin'."
Finn says: "Your loss, man."
Finn says: "The Dap of the Heavens only happens every 20 years."
Finn says: "Oh, man."
Finn says: "It's going down."
Two constellations tap their "fists" together.
Jake says: "Okay."
Jake says: "Let's watch some stars."
Finn says: "Hmm."
Finn says: "You missed it."
Finn says: "It was honestly a little disappointing."
Jake says: "Oh."
Jake says: "Okay."
Jake says: "Hey, man, I think I hear something weird over there with my little doggy ears."
Finn looks through his telescope at Flame Princess and Cinnamon Bun working out. They take a rest.
Flame Princess says: "Phew!"
Flame Princess says: "You are killing, Cinnamon Bun!"
Flame Princess says: "This routine is locked up!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Oh!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Thank you, Princess."
Cinnamon Bun says: "You are also killing."
Finn says: "You mean Flame Princess?"
Jake says: "Naw, man."
Jake says: "What I heard didn't sound like her."
Jake says: "Give me a peek on there."
Jake says: "This is pretty much just a tube."
Jake says: "Huh."
Jake says: "It's Lemongrab."
Finn says: "Uh, Lemongrab?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "What's he up to at this time of night?"
Jake says: "Uh..."
Jake says: "it looks like he's headed for the Mountain of Matthew."
Jake says: "I hear beaucoup spookoo legends about that place."
Finn says: "Beaucoup spookoo, you say?"
Finn says: "We should follow him."
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "How come you care where Lemongrab goes?"
Finn says: "He could, you know, he could be messing with crazy mystic power at that mountain."
Finn says: "It's like seeing a baby playing with dynamite."
Finn says: "Plus, seeing Flame Princess kind of messed me up."
Finn says: "Now I gotta distract myself with work."
Jake says: "Okay, okay."
Jake says: "I feel you."
Jake says: "Let's do some things."
Finn says: "There's his Lemon Camel."
Finn says: "Lemongrease must be inside already."
Finn and Jake run inside caves below the Mountain of Matthew.
Jake says: "Whoa!"
A Guardian of the Mountain forms and separates Jake from Finn.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "C'mon man!"
Guardian of the Mountain says: "Nope."
Guardian of the Mountain says: "Nuh uh."
Jake says: "Dang it!"
Jake says: "Quit bustin' my buns!"
Guardian of the Mountain says: "You have no beeswax in the Mountain of Matthew, supple yellow dog."
Guardian of the Mountain says: "But you, plucky adolescent, you have way cray beeswax."
Jake says: "You gonna be okay by yourself?"
Finn says: "Yeah, man."
Jake says: "Okay."
Jake says: "Just gonna sit down over hereâ€”"
Guardian of the Mountain says: "Not even."
Jake says: "Dong it!"
Lemongrab says: "Rocks."
Lemongrab says: "Dripping water."
Lemongrab says: "More rocks."
Lemongrab says: "Oh, I'm becoming stressed!"
Matthew says: "Continue forward."
Lemongrab says: "Hmm?"
Matthew says: "To reach me, you must choose correctly."
Lemongrab says: "Aah!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Come, Earl of Lemongrab!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Let us play the game of catch."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I am eager to relate to you."
Lemongrab says: "Yes."
Lemongrab says: "I desire this, as well."
Lemongrab says: "Huh?"
Lemonhope says: "Thank you!"
Lemonhope says: "Thank you all!"
Lemonhope says: "As your younger, more relatable new ruler, I shall endeavor to undo all the order imposed by my predecessor!"
Lemongrab says: "I unaccept!"
Lemonhope says: "No, Lemongrab!"
Lemonhope says: "You are unacceptable!"
Lemongrab says: "Prepare to be served in a pitcher by a little child!"
Lemongrab 2 says: "What a wondrous time you've experienced, and tomorrow there will be more adventures to be had for little Lemonsweets."
Lemongrab 3 says: "Ooh, wave farewell!"
Lemongrab 3 says: "What a lucky little boy you are to live so gaily."
Lemongrab says: "Lemonsweets."
Matthew says: "Choose."
Lemongrab says: "Ohh!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Lemongrab!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "We understand your styles."
Princess Bubblegum says: "We are of the same styles."
Lemonhope playing upbeat melody.
Lemongrab 2 says: "Eee!"
Lemongrab 2 says: "Aaaaaaaaaaah!"
Lemongrab 3 says: "No!"
Lemongrab 3 says: "It is my love that he prefers!"
Lemongrab 3 says: "He is spiteful of your love!"
Lemongrab says: "Don't hurt him!"
Lemongrab says: "Ohhh!"
Lemongrab says: "Ohhh!"
Lemongrab says: "Aaaah!"
Lemongrab says: "Ohhhh!"
Lemongrab says: "I'm inside you!"
Lemongrab says: "Aaaaah!"
Matthew says: "Taste the grease, Lemongrab."
Lemongrab says: "Okay."
Lemongrab says: "It's lemony."
Matthew says: "Look up, man."
Lemongrab says: "Aaaaaah!"
Lemongrab says: "I am grease?!"
Lemongrab says: "!"
Finn says: "Lemongrab, where you at?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Uh, cool."
Matthew says: "To reach me, you must choose correctly."
Finn says: "Who's that Matthew?"
Finn says: "Whuh-oh!"
Flame Princess says: "Yo, get up, C."
Flame Princess says: "B."
Flame Princess says: "!"
Flame Princess says: "This routine's got to be high-level outside the box!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Hey, Finn, quick!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Be me, bro!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Be me, bro!"
Jake says: "Oh, yeah!"
Jake says: "It's time, BMO!"
BMO says: "What is it?"
BMO says: "I can't smell."
Jake says: "Finn Cakes, boy!"
BMO says: "Yummy!"
BMO says: "Ooh."
Finn says: "Yo."
Finn says: "Dang."
Finn says: "Finn Cakes."
Finn says: "That's not fair."
Lemongrab says: "Okay."
Lemongrab says: "Goodbye, lemongrease."
Lemongrab says: "Goodbye, where?"
Lemongrab says: "Goodbye from my grease body into the blackness, where only my pure essence can go!"
Jake says: "Up-up, BMO."
Jake says: "Finn always gets the first Finn Cake."
BMO says: "Yo, give me a break."
Lemongrab says: "Pure essence!"
Lemongrab says: "Eject!"
Lemongrab says: "Blorg!"
Lemongrab says: "Bleject!"
Finn says: "Lemongrab!"
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Whoo!"
Finn says: "Later, spirit bro."
Finn says: "Lemongrab, you okay?!"
Finn says: "!"
Lemongrab says: "Finn, don't mess me up."
Matthew says: "Hi, Finn."
Finn says: "You're Matthew, huh?"
Finn says: "Your rep precedes you, bro."
Finn says: ""Proceeds"?"
Matthew says: "What kind of rep?"
Finn says: "Some stuff Jake said that I interpreted as negative."
Matthew says: "Well, ask yourself if that feels right."
Matthew says: "The meat bodies who've journeyed to this mountain have distilled themselves to their original source materials and  now exist in oneness."
Finn says: "Oneness?"
Finn says: "That's you, bro?"
Matthew says: "I keep adding to myself until the second age of terror, when I will emerge in my final form and restore the world."
Finn says: "That's why you're here, L."
Finn says: "G."
Finn says: "?"
Finn says: "To merge with Matthew?"
Lemongrab says: "It is one option, to know the ecstasy of my ego death."
Finn says: "Oh."
Finn says: "Well, nice knowing you?"
Finn says: "I mean, I know you got issues."
Finn says: "But you're, uh..."
Lemongrab says: "I know."
Finn says: "Are you sure, though?"
Lemongrab says: "Here's my other option."
Lemongrab says: "You see these?"
Lemongrab says: "Lemonjons?"
Matthew says: "Uh-oh."
Lemongrab says: "These lemonjons are me, and I wonder if they can destroy you."
Finn says: "Ooh, boy."
Finn says: "Lemongrab, hold up!"
Lemongrab says: "If you are the head that blooms atop the ziggurat, then the stairs that lead to you must be infinite!"
Finn says: "Careful with those metaphors, bro!"
Lemongrab says: "Infinite stairs are unacceptable!"
Matthew says: "Ohh."
Matthew says: "Aaaaah!"
Finn says: "Ooh!"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Geez!"
Creature says: "Oh, no, bro!"
Creature says: "Heck, no, bro!"
Creature 2 says: "Aaaah!"
Finn says: "Yo!"
Creature 3 says: "Smash that Lemongrab!"
Lemongrab says: "Try it, grease!"
Finn says: "Yes!"
Finn says: "Pow!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "I got you, bro!"
Jake says: "Why are you being so opaque about not letting me in there?"
Guardian of the Mountain says: "Well, get out a pen and paper and I'll school you on this biz."
Jake says: "Gol' ding!"
Finn says: "Dude, I was gonna ask him to move."
Lemongrab says: "Oh."
Jake says: "Yo, class, hold on."
Jake says: "Uh..."
Lemongrab says: "I'm done!"
Lemongrab says: "Let's go!"
Jake says: "Okay."
Jake says: "Here we are."
Lemongrab says: "Bye!"
Lemongrab says: "Aaaaaah!"
Lemongrab says: "Yo, yo!"
Lemongrab says: "It's grease!"
