The episode begins with all of the Candy People, along with Finn and Jake, dancing in the Candy Kingdom.
Finn says: "Candy Party!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "This party is so crazy!"
Jake says: "I know, Finn!"
Jake says: "I know!"
Gumdrop Lass 1 says: "So, Finn..."
Gumdrop Lass 1 says: "Do you have a girlfriend?"
Gumdrop Lass 2 says: "Oh, my gosh!"
Gumdrop Lass 2 says: "I can't believe you just said that."
Punch Bowl says: "What a wonderful, marvelous party!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "Okay."
Cinnamon Bun says: "I'm gonna do it."
Cinnamon Bun says: "Okay-okay-okay."
Cinnamon Bun says: "Everyone watch!"
Cinnamon Bun says: "I'm gonna do a flip!"
Cinnamon Bun stumbles backward and hits his head on a tower wall, cracking it.
Cinnamon Bun says: "Oh no!"
The crack streaks upward toward the balcony where Princess Bubblegum is dancing.
The tower crumbles and Princess Bubblegum falls.
Finn says: "Princess Bubblegum's in trouble!"
Finn runs towards the tower and bumps into a Candy Person.
Candy Person says: "Watch where you're going!"
Princess Bubblegum continues to fall towards the ground.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Ahhhhhhhhhh!"
Finn dives towards Bubblegum and catches her just before she hits the ground.
The Candy People gasp and murmur.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Please!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Calm yourselves, my people."
Princess Bubblegum says: "I am safe!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Oh, thank you, Finn."
Princess Bubblegum says: "You truly are my hero this day."
Finn says: "Cool."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hero..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hmmm..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Heeeeerroooo..."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hey, I just thought of something!"
Finn says: "Uhh..."
Finn says: "What'd you think of?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "I'll show you."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Come on!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "We'll go through my secret entrance."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Alright, everyone."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Turn around."
The Candy People and Jake stare blankly at Princess Bubblegum.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Well, turn around."
Princess Bubblegum says: "This entrance is secret."
Candy People says: "Oh."
The Candy People and Jake turn around.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Math."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Hurry, Finn!"
Finn says: "No way!"
Princess Bubblegum and Finn both dive into the hole in the wall.
Finn reaches back out and pulls the brick in, covering the hole again.
Princess Bubblegum says: "Here it is."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Check it out."
Finn says: "A magical globe?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "No, Finn."
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's what you can see through the globe."
An image of a book appears in the globe.
Finn says: "Golly!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Look."
Princess Bubblegum says: "See this book?"
Finn says: "Yeah, I see it!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's called the Enchiridion."
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's a book meant only for heroes whose hearts are righteous."
Finn says: "Shmow-zow!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "The book lies at the top of Mount Cragdor, guarded by a manly minotaur."
Princess Bubblegum says: "It's waiting for a truly righteous hero to claim it!"
Finn says: "Do you think I've got the goods, Bubblegum?"
Finn says: "'Cause I am in to this stuff!"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yeah, I know."
Princess Bubblegum says: "And yes, I do."
Finn says: "Then off I go!"
Finn jumps out of a high tower window.
Finn says: "Jaaaaaaaaake!"
Jake stretches up to catch Finn.
Finn says: "Thanks, pal."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Farewell, Finn the human boy!"
Finn says: "Bye, Princess!"
Finn says: "You know what time it is, buddy?"
Jake says: "Aaaaadventure time?"
Finn says: "Yeah, man!"
The scene changes; Finn and Jake are now at a gate in a wall surrounding Mount Cragdor.
Key-per says: "Greetings, young heroes to be."
Key-per says: "This mountain is called Cragdor."
Key-per says: "Its purpose is two-fold: To protect the Enchiridion and to test the hearts of those who seek to possess it."
Key-per says: "Many noble challengers have entered the temple to pass the grueling trials that lie behind these walls, but no one has ever left here alive or dead!"
Key-per says: "Only the truest most worthy hero can receive the heroes' Enchiridion and walk out these doors again!"
Key-per says: "If it is you, friend,  Perhaps the key is in you, child, but you cannot use your brawn here."
Key-per says: "The door is magically sealed."
Finn picks up Key-per, shoves his head into the key-hole and turns him.
Key-per says: "Oh ho!"
Key-per says: "You've unlocked the riddle of the door."
Key-per says: "Brilliantly done, child!"
Key-per says: "Please, reveal to me how you unraveled my clue."
Finn says: "I just thought you'd look cute stuffed in that lock."
Key-per says: "Oh, yes."
Key-per says: "That's how most people get in."
Finn says: "Bye!"
Key-per says: "You've passed the first trial, young heroes, but prepare yourselves!"
Key-per says: "For there are many trials ahead of you, and each trial is more treacherous than the last."
Jake says: "That way."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Finn says: "Dude!"
Finn says: "You can't smell the book from here!"
Jake says: "It's in the castle on top of the mountain."
Jake says: "Wish you had one, huh?"
Finn hears the voices yelling for help.
Finn says: "This way!"
Jake says: "What about the book?"
Finn says: "It can wait."
Finn says: "Someone needs our help."
Finn jumps over brambles and lands on his face.
Jake says: "Yo, Finn."
Jake says: "Are you alright?"
Jake says: "Did you get brain damage?"
Finn says: "I'm fine!"
Finn says: "Keep going!"
Finn says: "We have to hurry!"
Finn and Jake come up on three gnomes trapped in a lava pit. Finn reaches in and pulls them out.
Finn says: "I gotcha."
Red Gnome says: "Thank you for saving us."
Red Gnome says: "Now we can destroy this old lady!"
The gnomes fly towards an old lady who is tied to a stake.
Old Lady says: "La la la-la!"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
The gnomes zap the old lady with magic and she disappears.
Red Gnome says: "Every time you say "what" we'll destroy an old lady."
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
The gnomes zap another old lady and she disappears.
Red Gnome says: "Every time you say "no" we'll destroy an old lady."
Finn says: "No!"
Finn says: "Wai..."
The gnomes zap three more old ladies.
Finn says: "Please..."
The Red Gnome zaps an old lady.
Finn says: "Don't destroy..."
The Orange Gnome zaps an old lady.
Finn says: "Anymore..."
The Blue Gnome zaps an old lady.
Finn says: "Old women."
Red Gnome says: "Every time you look sad we'll destroy a big old woman!"
Big Old Woman says: "Well..."
Big Old Woman says: "Ever since I got the..."
Big Old Woman says: "Ahhhh!"
Red Gnome says: "Hey, guys."
Red Gnome says: "Every time he's a big wuss, let's destroy an old lady."
Other Gnomes says: "Yeah!"
Finn runs off, distressed.
Jake says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "Back off, you gnomes!"
Jake says: "That kid just saved you guys!"
Jake says: "You should thank him, not destroy old ladies!"
Jake says: "Do you even know what I'm talking about?"
Jake says: "Say thank you!"
Jake says: "Say..."
Jake says: "Thank..."
Jake says: "You."
Red Gnome says: "Kill him!"
The gnomes try zapping Jake with magic, but Jake twists his body and grabs the gnomes.
Jake says: "Get back in there!"
Jake walks towards Finn as the gnomes scream for help.
Jake says: "Hey, Finn."
Jake says: "You okay?"
Finn says: "No way, dude."
Finn says: "Those old ladies are destroyed because of me."
Finn says: "I'm not righteous."
Finn says: "I'm wrongteous."
Finn says: "Stupidteous."
Jake says: "Awww."
Jake says: "Don't let those gnomes and their illusions get you down."
Jake says: "They're just gnomes and illusions."
Finn says: "Illusions?"
Jake says: "Yeah, man."
Jake says: "Think."
Jake says: "What would regular, old, sweet ladies be doing wandering the hills of Mount Cragdor?"
Finn says: "Maybe they're lost?"
Jake says: "No way."
Jake says: "This place is designed to mess you up."
Jake says: "To mess with your head."
Jake says: "None of this is real."
Jake says: "It's all just trials to test your heroic attributes."
Finn says: "Hmmm..."
Finn says: "Hmmm!"
Jake says: "Now let's go get that book."
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "You're the smartest dog I know, man."
Jake laughs and then gets eaten by a giant ogre.
Finn says: "Jake?"
Finn says: "Jaaaaaaaake!"
Ogre says: "You cannot pass!"
Finn says: "Gimme back my friend!"
Ogre says: "No!"
Jake says: "It's ok, Finn!"
Jake says: "I can get out!"
The ogre shoves his finger into his nostril, pushing Jake back inside.
Finn says: "Let Jake go, or I'll..."
Finn says: "I'll kick your foot!"
Ogre says: "It is impossible for you to hurt me!"
Jake says: "Don't worry, dude!"
Jake says: "I found another wayâ€”"
Jake says: "oof!"
The ogre shoves his finger into his ear, pushing Jake back inside.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "I'm coming, buddy!"
Ogre says: "I think your dog finally fell into my stomach."
Ogre says: "Hey..."
Ogre says: "Where'd you go?"
Finn says: "I got your wallet, man!"
Finn grabs opposite edges of the dollar and glides away on it like a hang-glider.
Ogre says: "No!"
Ogre says: "My big money!"
Ogre says: "Give it back!"
Finn says: "Give me back my friend!"
Ogre says: "But I killed him already!"
Finn says: "Here's your dollaaaaaarrrrr!"
Finn glides back towards the ogre and does a flying kick into the his stomach.
Ogre says: "Oof!"
The ogre's stomach rumbles and oozes out his mouth.
He retches and Jake comes out with it.
Jake says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "Whoa-oa!"
Finn says: "You're okay!"
Jake says: "Stomachs are weird."
Finn uses the dollar to glide to the entrance of a stone temple near the top of the mountain.
Jake says: "Dude!"
Jake says: "You just flew us all the way to the top!"
Jake says: "Wait a minute."
Jake says: "I can smell the book right through this door."
Finn says: "Just a minute, Jake."
Finn folds the dollar into a paper airplane and launches it towards the ogre.
Ogre says: "Hey!"
The ogre catches the dollar and laughs happily.
Jake says: "You know what that was?"
Jake says: "That was righteous."
Finn says: "Thanks, Jake."
Finn says: "Now sniff out that book for me."
Jake says: "You got it!"
Finn picks up Jake and walks into the temple with him; Jake is sniffing the air.
They walk into a long hallway with arms holding knives sticking out from the pillars.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Dark Magician says: "Congratulations, Finn the human."
Dark Magician says: "You must be truly righteous to have made it this far."
Finn says: "Thank you."
Dark Magician says: "Now!"
Dark Magician says: "Enter my brain-world, and I will show you some aspect of yourself that you're not entirely aware of."
Black clouds part and Finn is in a gray, misty area.
Finn says: "Where..."
Finn says: "am I?"
Dark Magician says: "For your final trial, slay the beast!"
The Heart Beast, a giant heart with a glowing skeleton-arm, lands on the ground.
Finn says: "Why?"
Finn says: "Is it an evil beast?"
Dark Magician says: "Yeeeeessss."
Dark Magician says: "It's completely evil."
Dark Magician says: "Will you slay it?"
Finn says: "Shoot, yeah."
Finn says: "I'll slay anything that's evil."
Finn says: "That's my deal."
The beast attacks Finn, but Finn dodges and jumps on top of the beast.
Finn punches the beast until it bursts, gushes blood, and its body falls to the ground.
Dark Magician says: "Yeeeeessss!"
Dark Magician says: "You've done well, hero."
Finn says: "Thank you."
Dark Magician says: "Now!"
Dark Magician says: "As one last, last trial..."
Dark Magician says: "Slay this ant!"
Finn says: "Is it evil?"
Dark Magician says: "No!"
Dark Magician says: "But it's not good either."
Dark Magician says: "It's, uh, neutral."
Dark Magician says: "Will you slay it?"
Finn looks at the ant and raises his fist.
Finn says: "No!"
Dark Magician says: "If you want the heroes' Enchiridion, then slay this unaligned ant!"
Finn says: "Never."
Finn says: "Never."
Finn says: "Never!"
Dark Magician says: "Uh oh."
Finn kicks the Dark Magician in the crotch and the cloak falls to the ground, red mist pouring out.
Key-per says: "Congratulations, Finn the human."
Key-per says: "Now you have truly reached..."
Finn says: "Never!"
Finn runs up and punches Key-per in the stomach.
Key-per says: "Ooh!"
Finn says: "Oh, no!"
Finn says: "Mr."
Finn says: "Key-per!"
Finn says: "I-I'm sorry."
Finn says: "Why are you wearing that little devil costume?"
Key-per says: "These are my pajamas."
Key-per says: "I was getting ready for bed."
Mannish Man says: "Finn..."
Mannish Man says: "Jake..."
Mannish Man says: "You made it!"
Finn says: "Are you another trial?"
Mannish Man says: "Trial?"
Mannish Man says: "Oh, no!"
Mannish Man says: "I'm Mannish Man, the minotaur."
Finn says: "The manly minotaur from Princess Bubblegum's story!"
Mannish Man laughs and flexes his muscles at Finn.
Finn says: "So, can I check out the Enchiridion?"
Finn says: "Can I?"
Finn says: "Can I?"
Finn says: "Can I?"
Mannish Man says: "Yeah."
Mannish Man says: "Come on."
Mannish Man says: "Let's go check it out."
Mannish Man says: "Woohoo!"
Finn, Jake, Mannish Man and Key-per are walking up to a picnic table.
Mannish Man says: "We've been watching you guys on our magical viewing globe."
Mannish Man says: "Take a seat guys, have some juice."
Mannish Man says: "There's grape and apple and the gatekeeper made spaghetti."
Mannish Man says: "And..."
Mannish Man says: "Alright, Finn."
Mannish Man says: "Are you ready for this?"
Mannish Man pulls out the Enchiridion and makes a small explosion noise with his mouth.
Finn says: "The Enchiridion!"
Mannish Man says: "You deserve it, Finn."
Finn says: "Really?"
Mannish Man says: "Yeah, Finn."
Mannish Man says: "You're the goodest of heart and most righteous hero I've seen here."
Mannish Man says: "Tenderness, ingenuity, bravery, nard-kicking ability, and when you took that giant ogre's dollar..."
Mannish Man says: "Oh, man!"
Mannish Man says: "The Key-per nearly fainted!"
Key-per says: "It's true!"
Jake says: "Hey!"
Jake says: "Crack open that book and read something for fun's sake, alright?"
Finn says: "Oh, yeah."
Jake says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "What'd you just read?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Yeah."
Princess Bubblegum says: "What does it say, Finn?"
Princess Bubblegum says: "Mannish Man won't tell me."
Mannish Man says: "Hey."
Mannish Man says: "Don't tell her, Finn."
Finn says: "It doesn't say anything, Princess."
Princess Bubblegum says: "Mannish Man!"
Mannish Man shrugs at Princess Bubblegum.
Finn says: "Awwww..."
Finn says: "Yeah!"
The episode ends with the Adventure Time logo appearing on the screen.
