Finn and Jake are fighting a shark and Science Cat in front of their house.
Jake says: "Pussy cat!"
Jake says: "Come here!"
The science cat throws a potion on him that turns Jake into a butterfly.
Jake says: "Hey!"
The cat begins to chase Jake.
Jake says: "Help!"
Finn says: "Don't worry!"
Finn says: "His spells never last long."
Jake says: "Who are these guys?"
Jake says: "This is a great fight!"
Finn says: "Yeah!"
Finn says: "You never fought them?"
Finn says: "They come out every day at four o’clock on the dot."
Jake reverts to his normal form.
Jake says: "I guess that's because I meet Lady Rainicorn every day at four o'clock on the dot."
Jake says: "Oh shoot!"
Jake says: "I'm late!"
Finn says: "You should stay, man."
Finn says: "At five o'clock every day, I chop both their heads off, and they grow them back for the next day."
Jake says: "Aw, man, that sounds awesome!"
Jake says: "I do want to stay and fight those guys, but I also want to hang out with my girlfriend."
Finn says: "Boo!"
Finn says: "Bye!"
Finn says: "Hyaaaaaaaaah!"
Jake says: "Oh!"
Jake rides up to Lady Rainicorn's house and climbs up onto the roof with Lady Rainicorn.
Jake says: "Sorry!"
Jake says: "Sorry I'm late."
Jake says: "Finn and I were fighting this shark and science cat, and I lost track of time."
Jake says: "Anyway, I’m here now, M'lady, and I have brought to you half an orange."
Lady Rainicorn and Jake eat their orange.
Lady Rainicorn says: "Ooh!"
Lady Rainicorn says: "고마워!"
Jake says: "Nice!"
Jake says: "Now make that green!"
Jake says: "Ha ha ha!"
Jake says: "Yeah, that's good."
Jake says: "Sleep!"
Jake says: "But we were supposed to play viola together!"
Lady Rainicorn says: "미안해."
Jake says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "Sorry again for coming so late."
Lady Rainicorn says: "잘 자."
Jake is riding home on a path through a forest on his bike with his viola in the basket.
Shelby says: "Hi Jake."
Jake says: "Oh, hey, Shelby."
Shelby says: "Why you looking so down in the dumps?"
Jake makes a kind of deflating noise.
Shelby says: "No response, huh?"
Shelby says: "Guess you're good."
Jake says: "I'm fed up, Shelby!"
Shelby says: "Hmm?"
Jake says: "Whenever I hang out with Lady Rainicorn, I miss out on fun times with Finn."
Jake is using hand gestures to add emphasis, but he is riding a bike so he keeps swerving.
Jake says: "And then when I hang out with Finn, I'm missin' out on Lady Rainicorn!"
Jake says: "Oh!"
Shelby says: "Hey, Jake, why don't you just hang out with both of them at the same time?"
Jake says: "And then I won't miss anything!"
Jake says: "Shelby!"
Jake says: "My problems are solved."
Screen wipes to Finn, Jake, and Lady Rainicorn having a picnic by a fire pit.
Jake says: "Ah, isn't this great?"
Jake says: "This is totally great."
Jake says: "Isn't it?"
Finn says: "Yeah."
Jake says: "Isn't it?"
Lady Rainicorn says: "맞아."
Finn says: "What?"
Finn says: "What did she say?"
Jake says: "She said she also thinks it's great."
Finn says: "Oh."
Jake says: "Yeah."
Silent pause.
Jake says: "Hmm..."
Jake says: "Hey, did you know that you both have an awesome sense of humor?"
Finn says: "We do?"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Anybody have a joke?"
Finn says: "Oh, I have a joke!"
Finn says: "okay."
Finn says: "Knock knock."
Jake says: "She said, "who's there?"
Finn says: "Diarrhea!"
Jake says: "쟤가 설사래."
Lady Rainicorn says: "어, 나도 들었어."
Lady Rainicorn says: "뭐야, 하나도 재미없잖아."
Finn says: "Did she say diarrhea who?"
Jake says: "Uh, no."
Jake says: "No, she didn't say, "diarrhea who?"
Jake says: "" She didn't..."
Jake says: "say it."
Jake says: "Lady, how 'bout you tell a joke?"
Lady Rainicorn says: "글쎄.."
Lady Rainicorn says: "뭐가 있었을까?"
Lady Rainicorn says: "아!"
Lady Rainicorn says: "우리 완전히 다 벗고 상추밭 미친듯이 뛰어다닌 거 기억 나?"
Finn says: "What's the joke?"
Jake says: "Uhh..."
Jake says: "well, the joke doesn’t translate very well."
Finn says: "Man, I- I might leave."
Finn says: "Is it okay if I leave?"
Finn says: "I kind of want to go fight something."
Jake says: "Noooo!"
Jake says: "Don’t leave."
Jake says: "Oh, dude!"
Jake says: "I just remembered!"
Jake says: "There's a universal translator device at the bottom of Lake Szelezon!"
Finn says: "The lake guarded by evil Lake Knights?"
Jake says: "Yeah, I can't remember why I threw it in there."
Jake says: "Let's all go and get it!"
Finn says: "Whoa  Jake!"
Finn says: "You’re inviting Rainicorn?"
Finn says: "No offense, but isn't she a little too sweet for deadly adventure?"
Jake says: "Trust me, Finn, she’s the Rowdy Queen."
Jake says: "She can do anything!"
Finn says: "Hmmm."
Finn says: "Alright!"
Finn says: "Trust pound!"
The camera shows them fist pounding and then the Adventure Time logo spins from in between their fists.
Finn is riding Jake towards the lake with Lady flying beside them.
They get to the lake and Lady turns them blue with her horn.
Finn says: "Underwater camouflage!"
They are shown swimming down into the lake. Finn points towards a group of lake knights and the fight starts.
Finn fends off a few and Jake grabs a bunch and punches them. Lady attacks a few and Finn is seen strangling one knight when he notices the treasure at the bottom of the lake. He throws aside the dead lake knight and swims towards it. He grabs the translator and gives a thumbs up to Jake and Lady. Jake is Giving a thumbs up back when the lake starts rumbling. Finn is shocked when knights begin surrounding him from the crevasse surrounding the treasure. They overcome Finn and Jake is distracted by a couple while Lady runs down and knocks them away from Finn by spinning around. Finn rides Lady past Jake and out of the lake.
They shout in victory.
Finn says: "Lady!"
Finn says: "You are incredible!"
Finn says: "You should adventure with us all the time!"
Jake says: "All according to plan."
Lady Rainicorn says: "고마워, 나도 재밌었어."
Finn says: "Uhhh, what?"
Jake says: "Try sayin' something toots!"
Lady Rainicorn says: "..."
Lady Rainicorn says: "and then I ate all the peaches in the orchard, and that farmer was sooo angry!"
Finn says: "I like this voice!"
Lady Rainicorn says: "..."
Lady Rainicorn says: "and that's the end of my story."
Jake says: "Well, at least with old man option we can understand him, I MEAN HER!"
Jake says: "I mean you sugar!"
Lady Rainicorn says: "Hop on my back and I'll give you a ride home!"
Finn says: "Hai-yah!"
Lady Rainicorn says: "Come on my darling."
Lady Rainicorn says: "Wrap your legs around me."
Jake says: "I remember why I drowned that translator now."
Screen wipes to Finn and Jake riding on Lady's back over a forest.
Finn says: "Hey grandpa, how are you able to fly if you don't have wings?"
Lady Rainicorn says: "Well, light travels from the sun."
Lady Rainicorn says: "Then bounces off of our planet and then back into our eyes so we can perceive color."
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Lady Rainicorn says: "My body can intercept that light and dance around on it."
Jake says: "Lady!"
Jake says: "It's a little rocky in the back seat here!"
Finn says: "That forest wizard is giving away free power rings!"
Lady Rainicorn says: "Do you wanna try gettin' some Finn?"
Finn says: "Yeahs!"
Screen cuts to Finn, Lady, and some animals cheering for the wizard.
Finn says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Did you see that!"
Finn says: "?"
Finn says: "This is like the funnest thing ever!"
Jake says: "Where were you guys?"
Finn says: "Wait a minute, you didn't fly down with us?"
Lady Rainicorn says: "We thought you were behind us the whole time!"
Jake says: "Noooo!"
Jake says: "I was shouting your name!"
Lady Rainicorn says: "Ooh!"
Lady Rainicorn says: "Honey pot, we probably couldn't here you because of the cloud density."
Finn says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Check out these power rings!"
Jake says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "That's cool!"
Jake says: "You got ten of them?"

Finn says: "Still pretty cool though."
Jake says: "Yeah, they're awesome."
