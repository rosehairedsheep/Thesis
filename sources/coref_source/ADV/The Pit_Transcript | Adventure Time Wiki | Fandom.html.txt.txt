Kee-Oth flying to his Broke-up Dimension, carrying Jake.
Kee-Oth says: "Your butt is mine, Joshua."
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "My butt?"
Jake says: "Weird."
Jake says: "Where are we?"
Kee-Oth says: "This is my yoga room."
Kee-Oth says: "And this is your new home."
Kee-Oth says: "Downward, dog!"
Jake says: "Ouch!"
Kee-Oth says: "Welcome to revenge, Joshua."
Kee-Oth says: "You'll never see your loved ones again."
Kee-Oth says: "Everything you need for survival is booby-trapped!"
Camera pans to show drinking water and a toilet, surrounded by an electric barrier.
Jake says: "Hmm."
Kee-Oth says: "Now I'm gonna gank your blood the way you ganked mine."
Kee-Oth steals Jake's blood, which turns into a hat.
Kee-Oth says: "Boo-yeah!"
Kee-Oth says: "How does it feel, dog?"
Kee-Oth says: "How does it feel that I've juiced your body and turned your blood into man dazzle?"
Jake says: "Hmm."
Jake says: "Not that great."
Jake says: "I feel weird in my skin."
Kee-Oth says: "Wait."
Kee-Oth says: "Is that it?"
Jake says: "Yeah..."
Jake says: "but I could get used to this."
Kee-Oth says: "What?"
Kee-Oth says: "No!"
Kee-Oth says: "You have to suffer."
Jake says: "Okay."
Kee-Oth says: "No "okay."
Kee-Oth says: "" When I say something, you're supposed to disagree!"
Kee-Oth says: "Okay?"
Jake says: "Okay."
Kee-Oth says: "Sheesh."
Kee-Oth says: "You're causing tension in my neck and shoulders."
Kee-Oth says: "I'm gonna go stretch it out."
Kee-Oth says: "You stay here and suffer."
Jake says: "Okay."
The camera goes to the tree house.
Finn says: "Jake?"
Lady says: "여보세요?"
Finn says: "Hey, Lady."
Finn says: "Listen."
Finn says: "Your husband got abducted by Kee-Oth the demon."
Lady says: "누구?"
Lady says: "Jake?"
Finn says: "Yeah, your hubby - your boyfriend or whatever."
Lady says: "어머, 뭔 소리야!"
Lady says: "걔 내 남자친구잖아!"
Lady says: "왜 자꾸 우리 사이를 이상한 쪽으로 몰고 가려고 그래?"
Finn says: "Yo, my Korean is not that good."
Finn says: "Can you just get over here?"
Finn says: "We need to find a way to Kee-Oth's dimension 십시요.."
Finn says: "Alright."
Finn says: "That sounds..."
Finn says: "affirmative."
Finn says: "See you soon."
Finn says: "Bye."
Camera returns to the pit where Jake sits alone on a rock.
Little Buddy says: "Excuse me?"
Jake says: "Hmm?"
Little Buddy says: "Down here."
Little Buddy says: "Hi!"
Jake says: "Oh my fun."
Jake says: "I thought you was a rock."
Little Buddy says: "I'm not a rock."
Little Buddy says: "I'm a Little Buddy."
Little Buddy says: "Can you get off me, please?"
Jake says: "Whoops!"
Jake says: "Sorry."
Little Buddy says: "It's okay."
Jake says: "Cool."
Jake says: "You wanna be friends?"
Little Buddy says: "I'd like that."
Little Buddy says: "I've never had a friend."
Jake says: "Whoa."
Jake says: "Seriously?"
Little Buddy says: "My species spends its first twelve years sleeping."
Little Buddy says: "I just woke up today!"
Camera returns to the treehouse, where Finn and BMO sit on the floor, eyes closed.
Finn says: "Whoop!"
Finn says: "She's here."
BMO says: "I thought my body was hopping up and down."
BMO says: "But I was sitting still."
Finn says: "What is it, Lady?"
Lady says: "옛날에 조슈아가 만든 테잎이야."
Lady says: "제이크가 그 위에 그냥 녹음해버려서 기억하고 있어."
Lady says: "그 앞쪽은 보지 말고 그냥 빨리 돌려!"
Finn says: "What?"
Lady says: "앞쪽 보지 말고 그냥 빨리 달.."
Lady says: "돌리라구."
Finn says: "Eh, something skip?"
Finn says: "I don't know."
Finn says: "Just play it, BMO."
BMO begins playing the tape. An image of Joshua emerges.
Joshua says: "Jake?"
Joshua says: "Finn?"
Joshua says: "Jermaine?"
Joshua says: "Whoever is watching this?"
Finn says: "Dad!"
Joshua says: "I just opened up an unexplored cavern deep in the underground grasslands complex."
Joshua says: "Please refer to my chart system, okay?"
Joshua says: "I'm in cave 73H."
Joshua says: "In case I am overtaken by an enemy I need you to retrieve my corpse."
Image on screen changes to Jake, lying on a living room floor in front of a lit fireplace.
Jake says: "Hey, Lady."
Jake says: "You asked me to make you a video."
Finn says: "BMO!"
Finn says: "Skip!"
Finn says: "Skip!!"
Jake says: "..."
Jake says: "saying JTD won't change his doggy ways."
BMO begins fast forwarding. Finn looks at Lady, who shrugs and grins, embarrassed.
Finn says: "That should be good."
BMO resumes the video.
Screen changes to show Joshua in the cavern, in front of a demonic altar.
Joshua says: "Kee-Oth zaple myrups pama..."
Screen skips forward.
Static ends, BMO and Shelby are visible on screen.
Jake says: "Okay, this is scene one and take one of Heat Signature 2."
Jake says: "Ready?"
Jake says: "Action!"
BMO says: "Father, it has been a year since I was on the submarine, but, I still hear the screams!"
BMO says: "I was forced to choose; the lives of my men, or the entire planet!"
BMO says: "What would you do?"
BMO says: "Tell me father!"
BMO says: "I'm a mess, man!"
BMO falls onto the floor.
Shelby says: "Wait, what do I say?"
Jake says: "No!"
Finn says: "Hold on, BMO, I feel like we should watch more of this video for clues, but you gotta promise me that I'm not going to see more weird Jake stuff."
Lady says: "더이상 제이크가 이상한 짓 하는 거 없을 거야."
Lady says: "진짜야!"
Lady says: "그래도 내가 이 테잎 본 지 하도 오래 돼서 장담은 못 하겠네."
Lady says: "미안해."
Finn says: "Okay, high-five!"
Finn says: "Play it, BMO!"
Jake appears in front of a shower, with a towel wrapped around him.
Jake says: "Hmm, guess what, Lady?"
Jake says: "This dirty dog needs a bath!"
Jake takes his towel off.
Jake says: "Wawoo!"
The camera returns to the pit looking up at Kee-Oth.
Kee-Oth says: "This stinks!"
Jake says: "What'a mean?"
Kee-Oth says: "Come on, Joshua!"
Kee-Oth says: "Back in the old days, you would have been up here trying to take me apart!"
Jake says: "Uh, what?"
Jake says: "That's my dad, Joshua, back in the old days."
Cuts to Kee-Oth.
Jake says: "I'm his son, dude."
Kee-Oth says: "Shoot."
Kee-Oth says: "Where is he?"
Jake says: "He's dead, dude."
Jake says: "Don't make me get emotional about it."
Kee-Oth says: "Then why you being such a wimp then?"
Kee-Oth says: "Come on up here and beat on me like your dad would."
Jake says: "Okay, that's weird."
Kee-Oth says: "What's weird?"
Jake says: "You want to get beat up?"
Jake says: "That's weird."
Jake says: "I'm not doin' your weird biz."
Jake sits down.
Kee-Oth says: "You won't fight?!"
Kee-Oth says: "!"
Jake says: "Nope."
Kee-Oth yells in frustration and walks away, as Jake laughs. Kee-Oth comes back to the pit, and throws Samantha in.
Jake says: "What the—"
Jake says: "!"
Samantha yells as she falls into the pit, and lands on Jake. They fall on the ground, roll, and eventually stop.
Samantha says: "Hi."
Samantha says: "I'm Samantha."
Jake says: "I'm Jay T."
Jake says: "—"
Jake says: "the Dog."
Jake says: "I'm Jake."
Kee-Oth says: "Only one can survive my pit!"
Kee-Oth says: "This bozo tried stealing my blood too!"
Kee-Oth says: "So youse better duke it out, and see who gets to live!"
Samantha says: "But I haven't seen a man-dog in years!"
Samantha says: "And now the universe has dropped one into my arms!"
Jake says: "Whoa, lady, no way."
Jake says: "This boy's got."
Samantha says: "But fate has brought us together!"
Samantha says: "The stars have paired you with a goddess."
Jake says: "I like the way you talk, but you are crazy."
Kee-Oth says: "Kill or be killed, you two!"
Samantha says: "Yes, if I'm so crazy, then let's fight!"
Jake says: "No, girl, we can bounce outta here."
Jake says: "My friend Finn will save us any second now."
Samantha says: "I don't wait for rescue."
Samantha says: "I conquer till I am conquered."
Samantha says: "By love..."
Samantha says: "or by the hand of an adversary."
Jake says: "Well, I guess we're gonna have to fight then."
Samantha yells as she runs towards Jake, and tries to kick him. He dodges as Samantha punches him in the face. She grabs his head, and squishes it down, as Kee-Oth laughs. She throws Jake at a boulder and smashes another boulder into him.
Kee-Oth says: "Okay, take your time."
Kee-Oth says: "I gotta do my daily sun salutation."
Cut back to Finn, Lady, and BMO. A video of Joshua and Kee-Oth is playing on BMO's screen.
Kee-Oth says: "I'll show you!"
Kee-Oth starts to suck Joshua's blood, but starts gagging.
Kee-Oth says: "Dude, your blood is harsh!"
Joshua says: "That's because I've been drinking so much holy water."
Joshua says: "It's in my blood, sucka!"
Joshua says: "And naturally, I gotta go to the bathroom like crazy."
Joshua says: "Be right back!"
Kee-Oth says: "If I can't suck you, I'll suck myself's blood."
He sucks his own blood and creates the Demon Blood Sword.
Kee-Oth says: "Hehehe..."
Kee-Oth says: "Taste it, scrub!"
Kee-Oth says: "AUGH!"
Joshua says: "Man, I can't believe it..."
Joshua says: "I gotta wee-wee again!"
Beemo's screen turns to static and BMO ejects the tape.
Beemo says: "Would you like to rate this video?"
Finn says: "No time, Beemo."
Finn says: "Let's go find the cave from the video."
Finn says: "Maybe we'll find more clues there."
Transition to Lady and Finn walking to the cave.
Lady says: "잠깐!"
Lady says: "내가 네 주위에 보호막 쳐야 돼!"
She makes a circle around Finn and bites on her tail.
Lady says: "됐다."
Lady says: "이제 가도 돼."
Finn picks up two stone tablets and puts them together, reading the code written on them.
Finn says: "Kee Oth Zaple Myrups Rama Mancakes?"
The tablets break into fourths as they fly into the air.
Finn says: "Whoa."
The cave shatters into glass, hurdling them towards the Broken Dimension. The tablets fall into Finn's hands.
Finn says: "Jake?"
Finn says: "Yeesh."
Kee-Oth says: "Eh?"
Finn says: "Jake?"
Jake says: "Finn, yes!"
Jake says: "Help me!"
Lady says: "Jake!"
Lady says: "왜 저 못생긴 지지배가 널 껴안고 있는거야!"
Jake says: "This isn't hugging—"
Jake says: "it's fighting!"
Jake says: "Fighting!"
Finn says: "Jake, what do I do?"
Finn says: "Should I kill him?"
Kee-Oth says: "With what?"
Finn says: "With this!"
Kee-Oth says: "Demon blood..."
Finn says: "That's right!"
Finn says: "Demon blood beats demon!"
Jake says: "No, that is not correct!"
Kee-Oth says: "Hahahaha!"
Kee-Oth says: "Oh yeah!"
Kee-Oth says: "Gimme that blood, stupid!"
Kee-Oth starts sucking the blood from Finn.
Finn says: "Lady!"
Finn says: "Don't break the circle of protection!"
Lady says: "당연하지!"
Finn says: "Aw geez, he's sucking my sword off its hilt!"
Kee-Oth says: "Yeah, hahaha!"
Kee-Oth says: "Your circle can't stop my sucking!"
Kee-Oth says: "Now I have your demon blood as well!"
Finn says: "Except it's not demon blood!"
Finn says: "It's a frozen grape juice that was blessed by the priest."
Finn says: "Bless this sword, fodder."
Shelby says: "Mmm, check please!"
Finn says: "Mmm, grape-y!"
Flash forward to the Broken Dimension.
Kee-Oth says: "Wait..."
Kee-Oth says: "Aaaaaah!"
Kee-Oth explodes and Jake gets his blood back. Jake then stretches out of the pit.
Jake says: "My blood!"
Jake says: "Woo!"
Samantha says: "Coward!"
Jake says: "Woop!"
Jake says: "Hey, hey!"
Jake says: "Lady!"
Finn says: "Let's go, bros!"
Jake says: "Samantha, you can come too, I guess."
Samantha says: "Very well."
The dimension glass breaks, reforming into Finn and Jake's home.
Samantha says: "You've returned me to my world, so I recant my oath to destroy you."
Jake says: "You made an oath."
Jake says: "Okay."
Samantha says: "Let's fight again some time."
Jake says: "Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree."
Samantha says: "Hmm."
Samantha says: "Took you long enough to stretch outta that pit."
Lady says: "뭐, 뭐가 어떻게 된 거야?"
Lady says: "너 저 여자한테 반한 거야 뭐야!"
Jake says: "Pshh, please!"
Jake says: "Not even."
Lady says: "그럼 그 함정에서 왜 그렇게 오래 버티고 있었어?"
Jake says: "Uh, because..."
Jake says: "Kee-Oth was right there!"
Jake says: "An-and there were traps!"
Jake says: "I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it."
Lady says: "Jake!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Jake says: "Woo..."
Jake says: "Sorry, I got a little light-headed."
Lady says: "아, 이 말썽꾸러기."
Lady says: "사랑해 자기야."
Jake says: "I love you too, Lady."
Finn says: "Yo, guys, I still love Flame Princess."
Jake says: "Okay, big hug!"
Finn says: "Hug!"
Jake says: "Hug!"
Lady says: "Hug!"
The episode ends with a shot of the open door, as a leaf flies by.
