Music is heard in the Tree Fort where Jake is playing his viola and Finn is listening with a glazed expression and his mouth wide open.
Jake says: "Are you okay, dude?"
Finn says: "Yeah, why?"
Jake says: "You look bored."
Finn says: "Naw, that's just how I look when I'm listening to music."
Jake says: "Well good, because I'm about to kick it up a notch."
Finn says: "Bring it!"
Jake starts playing again, and Finn's expression slowly turns to the same expression. They then hear a knock at the door.
Finn says: "Who do you think it is?"
Jake says: "Could be anybody."
Finn says: "Hmm..."
Finn says: "I can't quite make it out."
Ice King says: "Eee!"
Finn says: "Ahh!"
Finn says: "It's the Ice King!"
Jake says: "The Ice King?!"
Jake says: "!"
Ice King says: "Think this is the right address,  mmm is this, is this..."
Ice King says: "."
Finn says: "Eiiiiaah!"
Jake says: "Yeah!"
Jake says: "Kick his butt, dude!"
Finn attacks Ice King with his sword, but the Ice King uses his ice powers to hover in the air and fire ice at Finn.
Finn says: "Eat my sword, Ice King!"
Finn says: "Aww."
Ice King says: "You can not defeat me, child!"
Finn says: "I will, though!"
Finn says: "With a sweet kick!"
Jake says: "Whoo, hoo hoo!"
Ice King says: "Now I can kill you!"
Ice King says: "Oh wait, wait, wait."
Ice King says: "I am so stupid!"
Ice King says: "Silly Billy!"
Ice King says: "I came by to tell you the good news!"
Finn says: "What's the good news?"
Ice King says: "I'm getting married..."
Ice King says: "to someone who wants to marry me!"
Finn and Jake both gasp.
Ice King says: "My betrothed is right over there!"
Ice King says: "Hi, honey!"
Old Lady Princess says: "Hey, cool guy."
Ice King says: "I'm a lucky guy—"
Ice King says: "I didn't even have to kidnap this one!"
Ice King says: "She fell in love with me the moment I slipped on her engagement ring!"
Finn says: "Eww."
Old Lady Princess says: "Bye-bye!"
Ice King says: "The lady penguins are throwing her one of those "bachelorette" parties."
Jake says: "This is weird, dude."
Finn says: "Hmm..."
Finn says: "if you get married, what about capturing princesses?"
Ice King says: "Oh well, no more capturing pretty princesses for this Ice King!"
Finn says: "Ohhh..."
Finn says: "well, fare thee well, Ice King!"
Ice King says: "Hmm?"
Jake says: "Yeah, good luck with ye and thy creepy wedding."
Finn says: "We totally support your decision to stop capturing princesses!"
Ice King says: "Sure wish someone would throw me a bachelorette party—"
Ice King says: "oop, I mean, "man-lorette" party."
Finn says: "But we hate you."
Ice King says: "If you won't throw me man-lorette party, then I'll never have my last hurrah before buckling down with that battle axe!"
Ice King says: "It'll drive me back to a life of stealing hot princesses!"
Ice King says: "Is that what you want?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Jake says: "No."
Jake says: "No, no, no, no, no."
Finn says: "Dude, we gotta show him a good time and treat him right."
Finn says: "Otherwise, he'll go back to imprisoning ladies!"
Finn says: "I-I can't have that!"
Finn says: "I—"
Jake says: "Alright, let's go party, Ice King."
A montage begins with Finn, Jake, and Ice King at a dance party with some Party Bears. A girl bear winks at him and he winks back, prompting Boy Bear to get angry. Ice King uses his magic to freeze him, after which Finn slaps the Ice King as punishment.
They are then shown at a bar with Tree People all around them. Ice King sips his drink but spits it out in disgust at the Tree Person next to him. The guy punches Ice King and Ice King uses his magic to blow him away. Finn slaps the Ice King again.
Finn and Jake are then seen floating down a river on a giant leaf with Ice King on a different leaf. Ice King does a cannonball next to them, splashing them with water and ending the montage.
Ice King says: "Fah!"
Ice King says: "Hahahaha!"
Ice King says: "Now I'm gonna go get married!"
Ice King says: "Hehehehe!"
Ice King says: "♫I'm gonna get married!"
Finn says: "Bye, Ice King!"
Finn says: "Good luck!"
Jake says: "Have fun being married!"
Finn says: "No more stealing princesses!"
Ice King says: "Yeah--wait."
Ice King says: "No more s-stealing princesses?"
Ice King says: "Wow."
Finn says: "What?!"
Jake says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "!"
Ice King says: "I didn't realize I'd have to give up stealing the ladies."
Jake says: "But you said you were fine with it!"
Ice King says: "I know what I said, but, y'know, sometimes you say things and then you don't really mean them."
Jake says: "What?"
Jake says: "Are you serious?!"
Jake says: "!"
Ice King says: "I'm just not sure I wanna get married in such a hurry."
Finn says: "We just took you out partying so that you could feel better about getting hitched!"
Ice King says: "Maybe I'll just go back to capturing lots of girls."
Ice King says: "It's what I feel comfortable doing, y'know?"
Ice King says: "Being free, wind at my back, lots of girls, kidnapping 'em."
Finn says: "Alright, here comes my double kick!"
Jake says: "Finn, Finn, cool yourself, buddy."
Jake says: "We need to get this guy married, remember?"
Finn says: "Yeah, I remember."
Jake says: "Watch."
Jake says: "Hey, Ice King?"
Jake says: "Don't be nervous."
Jake says: "Marriage is the most beautiful thing that could ever happen to a jerk like you."
Ice King says: "Really?"
Ice King says: "Why?"
Jake says: "Poots, that guy is good."
Jake says: "Why?"
Jake says: "Why?"
Finn says: "Jake—"
Jake says: "Not now!"
Jake says: "Why, why, why, why, why?"
Ice King says: "My mind is made up—"
Ice King says: "80% sure."
Ice King says: "No marriage."
Finn says: "Well, uh..."
Finn says: "don't you wanna grow old with somebody?"
Finn says: "Right?"
Finn says: "Just like these old swans."
Two old swans are shown kissing in a nearby pond.
Ice King says: "Bleh, those stinky old swans."
Ice King says: "Huh?"
The male swan swallows the female one. He opens his mouth and the other one pokes out its head and laughs.
Finn says: "What?!"
Jake says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Jake says: "!"
Ice King says: "Ohhhh, now I get what you guys are trying to tell me!"
Ice King says: "Marriage is a thing that allows me to capture a princess forever and let her live inside of me!"
Ice King says: "Marriage is the most beautiful thing in the world!"
Finn says: "Uhh..."
Finn says: "Yeah—"
Finn says: "I-I never—"
Finn says: "uhh..."
Finn says: "I guess it is."
Finn says: "Jake, this is bad news, man!"
Finn says: "We gotta go tell him that he can't eat his wife!"
Jake says: "Eh, let's cross that bridge when we get to it."
Jake says: "Look how happy he is."
Ice King says: "The wedding?"
Ice King says: "Back on—"
Ice King says: "100%!"
Finn says: "Phew!"
Jake says: "All that's left is the lousy wedding."
Finn says: "I'm weddy for the wedding!"
Finn and Jake walk to the Ice King's Castle wearing black bow ties.
Finn says: "Y'know, even though the Ice King is a wad, I'm pretty happy for him."
Jake says: "Uh-huh."
Jake says: "This wedding looks lame, man."
Jake says: "Be prepared to be bored outta your mind."
Ice King says: "Finn, Jake, you made it!"
Ice King says: "Come on up here."
Ice King says: "I'm almost finished tying up my bride."
Finn says: "Weird—"
Finn says: "and your bride is into that?"
Ice King says: "This is a traditional wedding ritual for good luck in the Ice Kingdom."
Ice King says: "You see, she'll be hoisted up and then lowered down—"
Ice King says: "and when she touches my beard from above, she will be my queen!"
Finn says: "Well..."
Finn says: "cool, man."
Finn says: "I'm glad y'all are happy..."
Finn says: "being crazy together."
Ice King says: "Thank you!"
Ice King says: "Excuse me as we finish preparing for the nuptials."
Ice King says: "2, 4, 8, 16, 20, uh—"
Snowman Priest says: "32."
Ice King says: "Yes—"
Ice King says: "32, 64, one hundred and—"
Ice King says: "eh."
Flower Girl Penguin lifts Old Lady Princess's veil and she opens her eyes.
Finn says: "Huh?"
Finn says: "Her eyes are huge!"
Finn says: "I'm gonna go check 'em out."
Finn says: "And stop scratching your ear, man—"
Finn says: "it's gross."
Jake says: "It wasn't me—"
Jake says: "it was my foot, dude."
Finn says: "Whoa, you've got ridiculously large eyes, princess!"
Finn says: "Are you allergic to somethin'?"
Old Lady Princess says: "No, Finn."
Old Lady Princess says: "I was just born like this."
Finn says: "Why are you crying?"
Old Lady Princess says: "I'm not crying, Finn—"
Old Lady Princess says: "my tear sac is broken!"
Camera zooms in on her eyes and an old lady behind bars can be seen in them.
Old Lady in eye says: "Help me!"
Finn says: "What?!"
Finn says: "!"
Old Lady Princess says: "I didn't say anything."
Old Lady in eye says: "The Ice King cursed me!"
Old Lady in eye says: "You've gotta set me free."
Old Lady in eye says: "I would rather die than marry the Ice King!"
Finn says: "He tricked me!"
Finn says: "And I was happy for that son of a toot!"
Jake says: "Look at her ring."
Old Lady Princess is shown wearing a spiky ring made of ice.
Ice King says: "She fell in love with me the moment I slipped on her engagement ring."
Finn says: "That's what cursed her!"
Finn says: "Don't worry, princess."
Finn says: "I'll remove this ring and save your life."
Ice King says: "No!"
Ice King says: "She's my love boat!"
Finn says: "No, man."
Finn says: "You cursed her."
Finn says: "She hates you!"
Ice King says: "Okay, that's your opinion!"
Jake says: "Wait a minute!"
Jake says: "So you knew she was cursed all along, which means you knew she wasn't trying to steal your Demonic Eye Junk or whatever, and you knew you had total control of her!"
Ice King says: "Yeah, yes, that's right."
Jake says: "So then why did you make us go through all that junk about why marriage is worth stuff?!"
Jake says: "!"
Ice King says: "Oh, I don't know..."
Ice King says: "I'm complicated—"
Ice King says: "and spontaneous!"
Ice King says: "That's probably why she wants to marry me!"
Jake says: "She wants to marry you because you brainwashed her!"
Ice King says: "Silence!"
Finn says: "Whoa, wait!"
Jake says: "Whoa, wait!"
Finn says: "Aw, man!"
Jake says: "Aw, man!"
Ice King says: "It's time for the lowering ceremony!"
Ice King says: "Hoist her up!"
Some penguins pull on the rope, lifting Old Lady Princess up into the air. Finn tries to break the ice holding his feet down.
Ice King says: "Hehehehe!"
Ice King says: "Commence the lowering!"
The Old Lady Princess starts being lowered slowly. Finn takes off his bow tie and uses it to break the ice.
Ice King says: "Yes, nothing can stop me now."
Finn says: "Hyah!"
Ice King says: "Strangling the groom's nose at a wedding?"
Ice King says: "What's wrong with you?!"
Ice King says: "!"
Ice King says: "You're the one that there's something wrong with!"
Finn lands at the top of the pyramid by the penguins that were holding the rope. They let go of the rope, dropping the Old Lady Princess. Jake catches her.
Jake says: "Gotcha!"
Jake says: "Hehe, no problem."
Finn says: "Ehh."
Finn says: "Huh?"
Ice King fires a bolt of ice at Jake.
Jake says: "Whoa!"
Finn says: "Jake!"
Jake starts falling from the weight of the ice but takes the ring off of Old Lady Princess as he falls.
Old Lady Princess says: "Huh, what?"
Finn says: "JAKE!"
Finn says: "Oh, hey."
Jake says: "Hey."
Finn says: "You got the ring off her finger?"
Jake says: "Huh?"
Jake says: "Oh."
Jake says: "Oh yeah."
Jake says: "Now she's not hypnotized, but we're still frozen."
Finn says: "I got a plan."
Jake says: "Oh, good."
Ice King says: "Now, let's try that again."
Ice King says: "Lower her!"
Old Lady Princess says: "You lousy, butt-faced pig!"
Old Lady Princess says: "I hate you!"
Ice King says: "Here she comes."
Ice King says: "Yes, touch my beard, deary."
Ice King says: "Yes, that's right."
Ice King says: "Almost there..."
Finn says: "Now!"
Jake's finger touches Ice King's beard.
Ice King says: "Oh!"
Ice King says: "I'm married, right, snowman?"
Snowman Priest says: "Yes, it's official."
Finn says: "It's official!"
Finn says: "You done married a dog, dude!"
Ice King says: "What?"
Ice King says: "What's that supposed to—"
Ice King says: "Oh no."
Jake says: "Wait, what the—"
Jake says: "?"
Jake says: "What am I laughin' about?"
Scene cuts to Tree Fort.
Finn says: "And now everything's back to normal."
Jake says: "Well, I wouldn't say everything."
Ice King says: "Come on, guys."
Ice King says: "Help me celebrate my un-marriage."
Episode ends.
