Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction.
Lucy Simian says: "Class!"
Lucy Simian says: "Time to hand in your homework!"
Darwin says: "What are we going to do?"
Darwin says: "What are we going to do?"
Darwin says: "If we tell her the truth, she'll flip!"
Gumball says: "Be cool, buddy."
Gumball says: "It'll be fine."
Lucy Simian says: "Ugh!"
Lucy Simian says: "At least it's on time."
Darwin says: "I wasn't built to take this much pressure!"
Gumball says: "Relax, man."
Gumball says: "We'll just tell her what really happened."
Lucy Simian says: "All right, you two."
Lucy Simian says: "What's today's excuse?"
Gumball says: "Our dad ate our homework."
Gumball says: "But, Miss Simian—"
Lucy Simian says: "And don't come back until you've learned how to tell the truth!"
Gumball and Darwin groan.
Counseling Part 1.
Mister Small​​​ says: "And this is what the inside of a liar looks like."
Gumball says: "Ewwww!"
Darwin says: "Ewwww!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Notice the dark abyss here."
Mister Small​​​ says: "That's the corrupt soul of the liar."
Gumball says: "But, Mr."
Gumball says: "Small, we're not liars."
Mister Small​​​ says: "You should tell that to the last boy who sat there and lied to me."
Mister Small​​​ says: "He's there now."
Darwin says: "The prison?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "No, next to it."
Gumball says: "The cemetery!"
Gumball says: "What happened to him?"
Mister Small​​​ says: "He just works there."
Gumball and Darwin sigh in relief.
Mister Small​​​ says: "Now, let me show you something."
Mister Small​​​ says: "This is the lying hat."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Now, watch what happens when I put it on."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Your mother called!"
Gumball says: "Oh!"
Darwin says: "Oh!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "She says she hates you."
Gumball says: "She does?"
Darwin says: "I think my heart just broke."
Mister Small​​​ says: "It's okay, kids."
Mister Small​​​ says: "That was a lie."
Gumball and Darwin sigh in relief.
Mister Small​​​ says: "But, you see, that's what a lie will do—"
Mister Small​​​ says: "hurt your feelings."
Mister Small​​​ says: "She hates you."
Gumball says: "Aww."
Darwin says: "Aww."
Mister Small​​​ says: "She loves you."
Gumball says: "Yay!"
Darwin says: "Yay!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Hates you!"
Gumball says: "Aww."
Darwin says: "Aww."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Loves you."
Gumball says: "Yay!"
Darwin says: "Yay!"
He continues to ask this until their voices become so fast that they're indistinguishable; Gumball and Darwin start breathing heavily afterwards.
Mister Small​​​ says: "So, what have we learned today?"
Darwin says: "Never trust a man in a hat."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Yes, but what else?"
Gumball says: "Uhhhh..."
Darwin says: "Uhhhh..."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Honesty is the best policy."
Gumball says: "Oh."
Darwin says: "Oh."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Say it."
Gumball says: "Honesty is the best policy."
Darwin says: "Honesty is the best policy."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Good."
Mister Small​​​ says: "And again."
Gumball says: "Honesty is the best policy."
Darwin says: "Honesty is the best policy."
Gumball says: "Honesty is the best policy."
Darwin says: "Honesty is the best policy."
Gumball says: "Honesty is the best policy."
Darwin says: "Honesty is the best policy."
Gumball says: "Honesty is the best policy..."
Darwin says: "Honesty is the best policy..."
The scene dissolves with the audio.
Just Want to be Honest.
Gumball Okay, Darwin. Remember, from now on, we only tell the truth.
Darwin says: "Okay."
Darwin says: "Your face is too big."
Gumball says: "Well, when you say "S," your gills whistle."
Darwin says: "You smell so stinky, sailor sings sea shanties about your stinkyness!"
Gumball says: "When you're asleep, your face looks like this!"
Darwin says: "When you're awake, your face looks like this!"
Gumball says: "You walk like a princess!"
Darwin says: "You walk like a pigeon!"
Gumball says: "Okay."
Gumball says: "That's us covered."
Gumball says: "Let's bring our honesty to the world."
They proceed to walk like a pigeon and a princess.
Darwin says: "You've got a monobrow."
Juke makes a sad tape rewinding noise.
Gumball says: "You've got no hands."
Alan deflates.
Gumball says: "Just being honest."
Darwin says: "Your face is burnt."
Gumball says: "I love you."
Penny gasps.
Darwin says: "But he'll never make the first move."
Gumball says: "Hm!"
Darwin says: "He's having a party on Friday, and he didn't invite you."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "What?!"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "!"
Idaho says: "Sorry, man."
Idaho says: "You're just not cool enough."
Gumball says: "Whoa-ho!"
Gumball says: "This one is long overdue."
Gumball says: "Hey, Tina?"
Tina looks at them and growls.
Gumball says: "You smell, and it's not very ladylike."
Darwin says: "It's like a sweaty watch strap."
Gumball says: "Nah, it's more like raw chicken and rancid milk in a plastic bag."
Darwin says: "Yeah—"
Darwin says: "that's been left in the sun for a week."
Gumball says: "Okay, now that we have your smelliness covered, let's move on to your personality."
Tina growls angrily and the scene cuts Gumball and Darwin smashed into the floor, after being stomped on by Tina.
Darwin says: "Ow."
Gumball says: "Yep."
Darwin says: "Ah."
Gumball says: "The truth hurts."
In Trouble Again.
Lucy Simian says: "Oh, Nigel..."
Nigel Brown says: "Let's leave all this behind and go live on a desert island."
Lucy Simian says: "But how would we survive?"
Nigel Brown says: "On fruit, water..."
Nigel Brown says: "and love."
Lucy Simian says: "Oh!"
Gumball says: "Did you ask us in here for a reason?"
Nigel Brown says: "Yes, of course, Watterson."
Nigel Brown says: "I've been getting a lot of complaints."
Nigel Brown says: "What on Earth's gotten into you?"
Gumball says: "Principal Brown, can I be honest with you?"
Nigel Brown says: "Uh, I—"
Nigel Brown says: "Y-yes."
Gumball says: "I can't help thinking that your relationship with Miss Simian could be compromising your professionalism."
Darwin says: "I completely agree, Gumball."
Darwin says: "And, frankly, I fear my education is suffering as a result."
Gumball says: "And besides, Principal Brown, you can do so much better than that."
Both Principal Brown and Miss Simian growl angrily at them.
Counseling Part 2.
Mister Small​​​ says: "Okay, so you got honesty wrong."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Perhaps we should try something else!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "I'd like you to meet a friend of mine."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Hello, children."
Mister Small​​​ says: "I'm the honesty bear."
Gumball says: "O-kay."
Mister Small​​​ says: "I'm here to explain that honesty's not all black and white."
Mister Small​​​ says: "But, like my fur, it's more of a gray area."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Gray."
Mister Small​​​ says: "See that?"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Gray fur."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Now, there are some things that are "too" honest to say out loud."
Gumball says: "Honesty Bear, I'm confused."
Gumball says: "What can we be honest about?"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Let me put this in a language you kids will understand—"
Mister Small​​​ says: "hippity rap!"
The song "The Honesty Rap" starts.
Mister Small​​​ says: "H-h-h-h-honesty!"
Break it down!
When you want to be honest, just beware.
Truth hurts in this nitrogenic atmosphere.
You gotta wake up, realize, and recognize.
Sometimes the truth has strategeical lies.
But keep them lies of a managable size.
Or tears will arise and hurt their eyes.
So before you speak, it's best to remember.
Each individual case will require a specific judgement call, depending on who you're talking to and the context of the conversation!
Song ends.
Mister Small​​​ says: "Any questions?"
Mister Small​​​ says: "No?"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Excellent!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Goodbye."
Gumball says: "Hmm."
Gumball says: "Okay, I think I got it."
Gumball says: "You should always tell the truth, unless you have to lie, but if you do lie, you should tell the truth about it, unless you're talking to someone who's lying, because if they tell a lie and you tell the truth, it'll be a lie because you were lying about telling the truth, inside of a lie, so the whole thing's a lie while still being true."
Darwin's head explodes.
Post-Counseling pt 2.
Gumball says: "Man, this "truth and honesty" thing is hard."
Nigel Brown says: "Has anyone seen the nurse?"
Nigel Brown says: "I think my head may be on fire."
Nigel Brown says: "Is my head on fire?"
Gumball says: "Um..."
Gumball says: "W-would it be a good thing or a bad thing if it was on fire?"
Nigel Brown says: "A bad thing, of course!"
Gumball says: "It's not on fire."
Darwin says: "It's not on fire."
Nigel Brown says: "Oh!"
Nigel Brown says: "Hoho, whew!"
Nigel Brown says: "For a minute there, I thought my head was on fire."
Nigel Brown says: "What a relief."
Nigel Brown says: "So, how are things with you, Watterson?"
Gumball says: "Uh..."
Gumball says: "yeah, not bad."
Gumball says: "You?"
Nigel Brown says: "Pretty good, pretty good."
Nigel Brown says: "So, no more of that lying trouble, I hope?"
Gumball says: "Eh..."
Gumball says: "No."
Nigel Brown says: "All right, then."
Nigel Brown says: "Toodle-oo!"
Counseling pt 3.
Mister Small​​​ says: "Hmmmm."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Okay."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Looks like I'm going to have to introduce you to someone else."
Mister Small​​​ says: "I'd like you to say hello to the Silence Snake."
Silence Snake says: "Silencessssssssss!"
Silence Snake says: "Silencessssssss!"
Gumball and Darwin let out a scared whimper.
Mister Small​​​ says: "Now, I bet your tiny minds are thinking..."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Well, why don't you ask the Silence Snake?"
Gumball and Darwin let out another scared whimper.
Mister Small​​​ says: "Go on."
Mister Small​​​ says: "He won't bite."
Gumball says: "O-kay..."
Gumball says: "What—"
Silence Snake says: "Silencesssssss!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Well, it looks like my work here is done."
Mr. Small falls into the bottom drawer of the filing cabinet and it shuts.
Mister Small​​​ says: "Uh..."
Mister Small​​​ says: "boys?"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Can you hear me?"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Say something!"
The Silence Snake is glaring at Gumball and Darwin, which makes them too scared to say anything.
Mister Small​​​ says: "I think my knees are digging into my back."
Mister Small​​​ says: "You need to help me."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Now, there should be a little, gold key on my desk."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Oh, don't worry!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "I've got it here."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Oh, gosh."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Please, no!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Oh, wait!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Maybe I can just—"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Aaaaah!"
Gumball and Darwin shudder.
Donut Sheriff says: "Elmore Police."
Gumball inhales, but Darwin slaps his mouth closed.
Darwin squeaks.
The Silence Snake is still glaring at them, they rush out the door to get help.
Donut Sheriff says: "Hello?"
Donut Sheriff says: "Hello?"
Donut Sheriff says: "I'm sick of these prank phone calls."
Looking for Help.
Nigel Brown says: "Hmm?"
Nigel Brown says: "Oh, it's just not the same."
Gumball and Darwin rush in making urgent sounds.
Nigel Brown says: "Oh, what now?"
Gumball and Darwin continue attempting to communicate without opening their mouths.
Nigel Brown says: "Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh!"
Nigel Brown says: "What's that supposed to mean?"
Gumball says: "Ha, ahh, nya!"
Gumball says: "Uh!"
Darwin says: "Hnngh,  hnngh!"
Nigel Brown says: "What?!"
Nigel Brown says: "!"
Nigel Brown says: "Miss Simian's trapped down the old abandoned well?!"
Nigel Brown says: "!"
Nigel Brown says: "I'm coming, my smoochkins!"
Nigel Brown says: "Hup!"
Nigel Brown says: "E-elbows, don't fail me now."
Lucy Simian says: "So, anyway, the plan is to live on fruit, water, and love."
Rocky says: "Dude, I don't care."
Lucy Simian says: "Well, go back to fixing the toilets, then!"
Gumball and Darwin run up and try to talk to Miss Simian.
Lucy Simian says: "What do you want?"
The boys do the same routine again.
Lucy Simian says: "What?"
Lucy Simian says: "I'm trapped down the old abandoned well?"
Lucy Simian says: "Oh, no!"
Lucy Simian says: "I'm coming!"
Lucy Simian says: "Come on, chin."
Lucy Simian says: "Don't fail me now."
Gumball and Darwin run into Rocky in the hall, his crowbars fall with a clang.
Rocky says: "Whoa-oa-oa!"
Rocky says: "Slow down, little dudes."
They do the routine for the third time.
Rocky says: "What's that?"
Rocky says: "Mr."
Rocky says: "Small rocked back smugly on his chair, fell into the bottom drawer of his filing cabinet, it locked shut, and you want to use these crowbars to break him out?"
Gumball says: "Mmmmm!"
Darwin says: "Mmmmm!"
Rocky says: "Aww."
Rocky says: "See ya!"
Saving Mister Small.
Mister Small​​​ says: "Aah!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Oh!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Aah!"
Gumball and Darwin rush inside the room.
Mister Small​​​ says: "Boys, i-i-is that you?"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Do something!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Anything!"
Darwin hits the side of the filing cabinet with the crowbar.
Mister Small​​​ says: "Ow!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Well, on the plus side, I think that loosened the lock a little."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Keep going!"
Both start hitting the cabinet with their crowbars.
Mister Small​​​ says: "Aah!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Aah!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Ooh!"
The drawer pops open, Mr. Small inhales deeply before Gumball accidentally hits it again, causing the drawer to shut. Gumball and Darwin facepalm.
Mister Small​​​ says: "Aah!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Just a thought, but maybe you wanna lever the drawer open with that crowbar?"
Gumball and Darwin strain to open the door, but the cabinet falls on the floor with a loud thud.
The Doughnut Sheriff bursts through the door.
Donut Sheriff says: "Freeze!"
Donut Sheriff says: "Police!"
Donut Sheriff says: "You're coming with me, you little hooligans!"
Gumball says: "But—"
Conclusion.
Donut Sheriff says: "Why won't you talk?"
Donut Sheriff says: "Talk, darn it!"
Donut Sheriff says: "Talk!"
Nicole says: "Officer, there's clearly been some kind of misunderstanding."
Donut Sheriff says: "Well, ma'am, looking at their rap sheet, it seems they are not first-time offenders."
Donut Sheriff says: "Multiple accounts of antisocial behavior, vandalizing school property, and setting their Principal on fire."
Lucy Simian says: "And all because you lied about your father eating your homework."
Richard says: "Okay!"
Richard says: "I did it!"
Richard says: "Take me away!"
Lucy Simian says: "But why?"
Richard says: "I thought it was gonna make me smart!"
Donut Sheriff says: "Well, it obviously didn't."
Donut Sheriff says: "So, I guess you boys didn't lie after all."
Nicole says: "Oh, I'm so proud of you two!"
Gumball says: "Thanks, Mom."
Darwin says: "Thanks, Mom."
Nigel Brown says: "Um..."
Nigel Brown says: "one more thing."
Nigel Brown says: "You don't happen to know where Mr."
Nigel Brown says: "Small is, do you?"
Donut Sheriff says: "The only clue we could find was this sock."
The Silence Snake hisses and Gumball and Darwin immediately deny that they know where Mr. Small is.
Donut Sheriff says: "Oh, well."
Donut Sheriff says: "Case closed!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "This isn't funny anymore!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Can somebody please open this thing?!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "!"
Rocky says: "Huh?"
Mister Small​​​ says: "He-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-l—"
