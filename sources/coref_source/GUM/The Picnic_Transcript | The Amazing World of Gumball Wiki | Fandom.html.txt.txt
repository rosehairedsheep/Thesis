Inside the Bus.
The episode starts on a bus with Miss Simian and her class.
Lucy Simian says: "Everyone, look at your maps."
Lucy Simian says: "This is the route we'll be taking to the picnic area."
Lucy Simian says: "We go along the path, avoiding the Forest of Doom, down the ravine, avoiding the Forest of Doom, along the lake, still avoiding the Forest of Doom, and arrive at the picnic area."
Lucy Simian says: "Understand?"
Students says: "Yes, Miss Simian."
Darwin says: "Did she say avoid or go through the Forest of Doom?"
Gumball says: "What would you do without me, Darwin?"
Gumball says: "She said go through the Forest of Doom."
Gumball says: "Am I right, or am I right, Miss Simian?"
Gumball says: "Huh?"
Darwin says: "Huh?"
Gumball says: "They're gone!"
Darwin says: "They're gone!"
Gumball says: "Don't worry, buddy."
Gumball says: "Stick with me, and you'll be just fine."
Gumball says: "We'll get to that picnic area long before they do."
In the Forest of Doom.
Darwin says: "You still got the map, right?"
Gumball says: "Of course."
Gumball says: "I swallowed it, then memorized it."
Darwin says: "Oh, okay."
Darwin says: "Wait..."
Darwin says: "how does that work?"
A tree behind Darwin makes faces and growls at him; Darwin shrugs and walks away as it laughs evilly.
Gumball says: "Darwin, you know what's important in a situation like this?"
Darwin says: "A map?"
Gumball says: "No, teamwork."
Darwin says: "Oh."
Darwin says: "I was gonna say that next."
Gumball says: "Don't worry, buddy."
Gumball says: "You're part of my team, and I'm a born survivor!"
Darwin says: "I'm glad I'm on your team!"
Darwin says: "Hey, little squirrels!"
Squirrel says: "They'll never get out of here alive."
Squirrel 2 says: "We'll feed on their carcasses!"
The Wind.
Gumball says: "All we have to do to find our way, is to follow nature's clues."
Darwin says: "What clues?"
Gumball says: "The wind is one clue."
Gumball says: "Listen."
Wind says: "You're going the wrong way."
Darwin says: "What did it tell you?"
Gumball says: "It said we're going the right way!"
Wind says: "I said wrong way!"
Gumball says: "Yep!"
Gumball says: "Definitely!"
Gumball says: "This is the way!"
Wind says: "Losers."
Darwin says: "Oh."
Darwin says: "I guess the wind is wrong."
Gumball says: "Don't worry!"
Gumball says: "I shall follow Miss Simian's smell!"
Gumball says: "Oh."
Darwin says: "It kinda smells a bit like her."
Gumball says: "That's fine."
Gumball says: "We shall find our way using the stars!"
Darwin says: "But the sun is out."
Darwin says: "There are no words to express the pain that I feel right now."
Gumball says: "Sure there are."
Gumball says: "Aaaaaah!"
Darwin says: "Aaaaaah!"
Darwin says: "Gumball?"
Gumball says: "Hm?"
Darwin says: "Are we lost?"
Gumball says: "Yep."
Circles.
Darwin says: "So where do we go now?"
Gumball says: "I don't know, dude."
Gumball says: "I'm no survivor..."
Gumball says: "I'm just useless."
Darwin says: "But we're still alive."
Darwin says: "Hungry, cold, and lost, but alive!"
Darwin says: "And we're still a team!"
Darwin says: "I know you can get us out of here."
Darwin says: "Let's have lunch; you'll feel better."
Darwin says: "Fish flakes or diet fish flakes?"
Gumball says: "You're right, buddy!"
Gumball says: "I am a survivor, and I will get us to the picnic!"
Darwin says: "Can I have the diet fish flakes?"
Gumball says: "You don't wanna eat that!"
Gumball says: "Not when you're in the middle of nature's supermarket."
Darwin says: "What?"
Gumball says: "Look at this tree, Darwin."
Gumball says: "It's made from little bits..."
Gumball says: "which themselves are made from the smallest bits of all: circles."
Gumball says: "Circles with other little circles going around."
Gumball says: "So, since everything is made from circles, then so is food."
Gumball says: "Which means this rock is exactly the same as a chicken nugget, so let's eat it!"
They bite into it and break their teeth and Gumball sighs.
Darwin says: "Chicken nuggets taste like rock."
Gumball says: "Don't worry, dude, there's loads of stuff made of circles."
Gumball says: "That's why it's called the "circle of life."
Darwin says: "Oh..."
Darwin says: "is that made of circles too?"
He points at a deer drinking at a lake.
Gumball says: "Even better than circles!"
Gumball says: "It's made of meat!"
Darwin says: "But we don't have a weapon."
Gumball says: "Hm..."
Gumball says: "hang on, Darwin, I don't need weapons, I got claws."
Gumball says: "I am a predator, hear me roar!"
Gumball says: "Let's sneak up on him."
Darwin says: "Uh, Gumball?"
Gumball says: "Dude, we are trying to sneak up on it!"
Gumball runs into the animal's behind and Darwin runs into Gumball.
Darwin says: "Come on, get him!"
Gumball says: "Uh, you first."
Darwin says: "Okay."
Darwin says: "Can we eat it now?"
The creature turns to around and shows its deformed face.
Gumball says: "Whoops!"
Gumball says: "Maybe we should try something smaller."
They both see a caterpillar and smile at each other.
Darwin says: "Why are we smiling?"
Darwin says: "Gumball, please!"
Darwin says: "Please don't eat it!"
Gumball says: "It's him or us, dude."
Gumball says: "We gotta eat something."
Darwin says: "But look at him!"
Darwin says: "He's so cute!"
Gumball looks at the caterpillar, which is crying and pouting.
Gumball says: "What was I thinking?"
Gumball says: "I'm sorry, little dude."
Gumball says: "Bye bye!"
Gumball says: "Cherish your freedom!"
Darwin says: "Never abandon your dreams!"
Gumball says: "And have a beautiful life!"
Gumball and Darwin watch in horror and disgust as a bird swoops down and snatches up the caterpillar, then as a bigger monster eats the bird, then as that monster is eaten by another monster, which is eaten by another monster.
Darwin says: "That was horrible."
Gumball says: "Well, it's nature's way, Darwin."
Gumball says: "He was at the bottom of the food chain."
Darwin says: "Who's at the bottom now?"
The monster notices them and smiles evilly, causing them to run to the top of a tree.
Gumball says: "I think he's gone."
Gumball says: "What was that?"
Darwin says: "It's my tummy."
Gumball says: "Well, stop it."
Gumball says: "You're gonna attract another predator!"
Darwin says: "But I'm hungry."
Gumball says: "Will you please stop talking about food?"
Darwin says: "Okay."
Darwin says: "I'm cold."
Gumball says: "Fine, let's make a fire."
Gumball tries to make a fire by rubbing a stick on a log.
Darwin says: "Faster!"
Gumball goes faster.
Darwin says: "Faster!"
Gumball goes faster.
Darwin says: "Faster!"
Gumball goes faster before screeching and stopping.
Gumball says: "Useless!"
Gumball says: "It's never gonna work!"
Gumball tries to put the fire out on his hands, and Darwin stares at the log then a fire starts.
Darwin says: "Gumball, it worked!"
Gumball says: "Of course it did."
Gumball says: "I told you I was a born survivor."
Gumball says: "Good work, team."
Darwin says: "High five!"
Darwin says: "I'm really hungry."
Gumball says: "Yeah, me too."
Right next to Gumball and Darwin is the picnic picnic area, where it is not raining.
Lucy Simian says: "Anyone for a fourth helping?"
Banana Joe says: "I'll have it."
The Team Splits.
Gumball says: "Ugh, I'm so hungry!"
Gumball says: "I think I've started to digest myself."
Gumball says: "And there's no food around here for miles!"
Gumball says: "What?"
Darwin attacks him, and Gumball screams, scaring some birds out of the tree above them. The sound of Darwin eating something is heard off-screen.
Gumball says: "What is wrong with you?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "You ate all my clothes!"
Darwin says: "Well, maybe you shouldn't have thrown away my lunchbox."
Gumball says: "Yeah, I know."
Gumball says: "I'm sorry."
Darwin says: "You wouldn't be naked if I had my lunchbox."
Gumball says: "Yeah, yeah, I get it."
Darwin says: "I sure wish I had my lunchbox."
Gumball says: "Ah, you just don't get it, do you!"
Gumball says: "You're holding me back!"
Gumball says: "You're on your own!"
Gumball says: "See you later, buddy!"
Gumball says: "You can find your own way to the picnic!"
Darwin says: "But I thought we were a team."
Gumball says: "I don't need anyone on my team!"
Gumball says: "I am a born survivor!"
Gumball says: "Somebody please help me!"
The Team Reconciles.
Darwin appears.
Darwin says: "Nobody messes with my team!"
Darwin says: "Don't make me hurt you!"
Gumball says: "Dude!"
Gumball says: "What are you doing?"
Darwin says: "Bad!"
Darwin says: "Bad predator!"
Darwin says: "And there's plenty more where that came from!"
The other smaller monsters gasp and leave.
Gumball says: "You..."
Gumball says: "you came back to save me?"
Darwin says: "Of course!"
Darwin says: "We're a team, remember?"
Gumball says: "I'm sorry I was such a jerk to you before."
Gumball says: "I guess I was really hungry and cold and..."
Gumball says: "naked."
Darwin says: "Maybe you shouldn't have thrown away my lunchbox."
Gumball says: "I know."
Darwin says: "And swallowed the map."
Gumball says: "Yeah, sorry."
Darwin says: "And got us lost."
Gumball says: "Yeah..."
Darwin says: "And made me chew on a rock."
Gumball says: "Alright!"
Gumball says: "I said I was sorry!"
Gumball says: "So, still friends?"
Darwin says: "Of course!"
They hug, sighing.
Gumball says: "Cool, 'cause I twisted my ankle, so you're gonna have to carry me to the picnic area."
Darwin carries Gumball to the picnic area and the students see them.
Everyone says: "Eww!"
Cut to Gumball and Darwin who have dried up faces.
Gumball says: "Look, Darwin, food!"
He points to a full trash can and they both eat out of it.
Leslie​ says: "Miss Simian!"
Leslie​ says: "Gumball's eating from the trash can!"
Leslie​ says: "And he's naked."
Lucy Simian says: "Don't care!"
Lucy Simian says: "Everybody back to the bus!"
Lucy Simian says: "We go along the path, avoiding the Forest of Doom, down the ravine, avoiding the Forest of Doom..."
Gumball says: "That was so good!"
Gumball says: "Huh?"
Gumball says: "They've gone!"
Darwin says: "They've gone!"
Darwin says: "Did she say avoid or go through the Forest of Doom?"
