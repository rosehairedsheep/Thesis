Gumball's Old BFF.
Right outside the Wattersons' house, the doorbell rings, and Darwin answers it.
Darwin says: "Uh, Gumball?"
Gumball says: "What?"
Darwin says: "Someone put a pair of eyes on some cotton candy and dumped it on our doorstep."
Fuzzy says: "My name is Fuzzy."
Darwin says: "Oh, no, wait."
Darwin says: "It's one of those nineties talking toys that are creepier than bald men with long hair."
Fuzzy says: "Dude, I'm alive."
Fuzzy says: "This is just how I look."
Darwin says: "I'm so sorry."
Fuzzy says: "It's fine."
Darwin says: "..."
Darwin says: "for you!"
Fuzzy says: "Does Gumball Watterson still live here?"
Darwin says: "Oh, yes."
Darwin says: "Gumball!"
Gumball walks over, sees Fuzzy and gasps.
Fuzzy says: "Hey, partner!"
Gumball says: "Aw, Fuzzy!"
Gumball says: "You haven't changed at all!"
Darwin says: "Oh, so it's congenital."
Gumball says: "Darwin, this is Fuzzy, my BFF!"
Darwin says: "Oh..."
Darwin says: "Pleased to meet you."
The scene cuts to the kitchen.
Darwin says: "Did you really have to invite him for lunch?"
Gumball says: "Why are you so angry I had a best friend before you?"
Darwin says: "Heh, no one's angry."
Darwin says: "Who's angry?"
Gumball points at Fuzzy, whom Darwin is about to put in the oven.
Darwin says: "Oh."
Darwin says: "Sorry, dude."
Gumball says: "Why don't you have a seat, Fuzzy?"
Gumball says: "We'll bring out some food that isn't you."
Fuzzy says: "Uh, thanks, man."
Darwin says: "So, how long were you guys a thing?"
Gumball says: "Uh, a few years before you arrived and before he—"
Darwin says: "Hmm, hmm, hmm..."
Gumball says: "Uh, what are you doing?"
Darwin says: "Oh, I was just trying to work out if I give a darn!"
Gumball sighs.
Darwin says: "So, was it serious?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, you know, things were moving along."
Gumball says: "We moved into a hideout together..."
Gumball says: "Uh, what are you doing now?"
Darwin says: "Oh, just looking for a darn to give."
Darwin says: "Were there others?"
Gumball says: "No, of course not!"
Gumball says: "You're—"
Darwin says: "Take this."
Darwin says: "I'm afraid that's all the darns I have to give."
Gumball groans and walks away.
Gumball says: "Hey dude, why don't we hang out and grab something to eat in town?"
Gumball says: "The food here is a little too salty!"
Gumball slams the door.
Darwin says: "Oh, yeah?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Darwin says: "Well, you know what?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Darwin says: "Uh, you—"
Darwin says: "you—"
Darwin says: "you know what?"
Darwin says: "Uh, uh, you—"
Darwin says: "you, uh..."
Darwin says: "You, uh, ah..."
Catching Up.
The scene cuts to Gumball and Fuzzy on swings.
Gumball says: "So, what you've been up to?"
Gumball says: "How's Minnesota?"
Gumball says: "Made any friends?"
Fuzzy says: "It's hard to tell."
Fuzzy says: "Everyone is wearing ski masks all year long."
Fuzzy says: "Either I have friends or I'm on a CIA watch list."
Gumball chuckles.
Fuzzy says: "Yeah, summer's so short there they just call it "s."
Gumball laughs.
Fuzzy says: "It's so cold up there, rappers can only sag their pants under their nipple level."
Gumball says: "Alright, alright, I get it."
Gumball says: "It's great!"
Gumball says: "Stop trying to make me jealous."
Fuzzy says: "Yeah, well, it would've been better if you were around."
Gumball says: "It's that lonely up there, huh?"
Fuzzy says: "No, I do have one friend, Hank."
Fuzzy says: "He's pretty frozen."
Gumball says: "What?"
Fuzzy says: "That's how you say cool in Minnesota."
Fuzzy says: "You have to adjust the temperature."
Fuzzy says: "Although, if he knew I was hanging out with you now, I'd probably be in room-temperature water."
Gumball says: "Huh?"
Gumball says: "Oh."
Fuzzy says: "He's a nice guy, but, you know, it's not the same."
Gumball says: "Look, I'm sorry, Fuzz."
Gumball says: "I really wanted to keep in touch and send you a letter or something, but turns out it takes toddlers four years to learn how to write."
Gumball says: "After all that time, it felt a bit like posting a get-well-soon card through the window of a hearse."
Fuzzy says: "Well, I'm back now, and I'm glad we get to catch up on lost time."
Gumball says: "Me too, buddy."
Gumball says: "Me too."
Making a Deal with Darwin.
As Gumball walks back home, Darwin is still heard thinking of a comeback.
Darwin says: "Well, you—"
Darwin says: "you know what?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Darwin says: "Uh, well, you know what?"
Darwin says: "You're like a..."
Gumball says: "What the?"
Gumball opens the door.
Darwin says: "Uh, well, you know what?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Darwin says: "Uh..."
Gumball says: "Dude, are you seriously still looking for a comeback?"
Darwin says: "Hmph!"
Gumball says: "Darwin, just because Fuzzy's back in my life doesn't mean I love you any less."
Darwin says: "Really?"
Darwin says: "How much do you love me?"
Gumball says: "Dude, I love you more than elderly people love walking around in their birthday suits in sports locker rooms."
Darwin says: "More than Canadians love telling you which famous people are Canadian?"
Gumball says: "More than PC gamers love to bash game consoles."
Darwin says: "That's quite a lot."
Gumball says: "Come here."
Gumball says: "Mm."
Darwin says: "Mm."
Darwin says: "I'm sorry if it looks like I'm overreacting, but I just don't trust that guy."
Darwin says: "He looks like a hairy thumb with bulbous, soulless, motion-capture eyes."
Gumball says: "Would you please just give him a chance?"
Gumball says: "For me?"
Darwin says: "Ugh."
Gumball says: "How about we hang out together and play some games?"
Gumball says: "You'll see."
Gumball says: "He's a great guy."
Darwin says: "Fine."
Darwin says: "Sorry my seasoning isn't the taste of your treasoning!"
Gumball says: "What?"
Darwin says: "You know, the salt comeback from before, and—"
Darwin says: "oh, never mind."
During daytime, Gumball, Darwin, and Fuzzy are playing a video game.
Gumball says: "Man, I am really struggling with this third-party controller."
Gumball says: "I think it's broken."
Fuzzy says: "Dude, that's not a controller."
Darwin says: "Yeah, it's the remote from Mister Dad's new massage chair."
Richard says: "Huh?!"
Richard says: "!"
Richard says: "Uh, ugh!"
Richard says: "Ugh, ugh!"
Gumball, Darwin, and Fuzzy laugh.
Gumball says: "All right, you guys."
Gumball says: "Finish this one, and I'll take the winner."
Gumball says: "I'll just go get some drinks."
Darwin says: "Okay, what's your game, you furry creep muffin?"
Fuzzy says: "Ugh."
Fuzzy says: "Look, just give me a chance."
Darwin says: "A "chance" to abduct your best friend and lock him up in a cabin in the woods?"
Fuzzy says: "What the?"
Fuzzy says: "No!"
Fuzzy says: "Look, can we just bury the hatchet?"
Darwin says: ""Bury?"
Darwin says: "" "Hatchet?"
Fuzzy says: "Okay, I don't know what you're trying to rope me into, but—"
Darwin says: ""Rope?"
Fuzzy says: "Dude, you have a pretty weird relationship with your BFF."
Darwin says: ""BFF-F-F-F-F-F-F-F."
Fuzzy says: "All right, I'm out of here."
Gumball says: "What?"
Gumball says: "W-why?"
Gumball says: "What's going on?"
Fuzzy says: "Look, I was gonna invite you guys to a sleepover, but I think it's best if I don't."
Fuzzy says: "I don't want to make any waves between you and Darwin."
Fuzzy says: "I just think you guys need a little chat..."
Fuzzy says: "in front of a shrink..."
Fuzzy says: "while wearing straitjackets..."
Fuzzy says: "behind two-way glass..."
Fuzzy says: "under the supervision of armed guards..."
Fuzzy says: "because you're crazy."
Fuzzy says: "I just wanted to make that clear."
Fuzzy says: "Okay, bye."
Darwin says: "Buh-bye."
Gumball says: "Wait, what?"
Gumball says: "No."
Gumball says: "F-Fuzzy!"
Gumball says: "Fuz—"
Gumball says: "ugh."
Gumball enters their bedroom as Darwin is shown using the computer.
Gumball says: "What did you do?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "Nothing."
Gumball says: "You obviously did something."
Gumball says: "Did you see his face?"
Gumball says: "He had the expression of someone who had just sat down on a warm toilet seat."
Gumball says: "What did he ever do to you?"
Darwin says: "Well, when you went away to get drinks, he—"
Darwin says: "he stood up, grabbed a fire poker, and..."
Darwin says: "and..."
Darwin says: "he..."
Darwin says: "Yeah, okay, I completely made that up and probably shouldn't have."
Gumball says: "Agh!"
Gumball says: "Why are you acting like this?"
Darwin says: "I just think it's interesting that this guy's back in Elmore."
Gumball says: "No, you don't."
Gumball says: "You think it's suspicious."
Gumball says: "Just say "suspicious!"
Darwin says: "No, I just think it's intriguing—"
Gumball says: "No, you don't."
Gumball says: "You think it's sinister."
Gumball says: "Just say "sinister."
Darwin says: "I'm just fascinate—"
Gumball says: "You're jealous!"
Gumball says: "Just say "jealous!"
Darwin sputters, aloof of Gumball.
Gumball says: "Hmph."
Darwin says: "Wait."
Darwin says: "Where are you going?"
Gumball says: "To the brony convention in Liechtenstein."
Gumball says: "Where do you think I'm going?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "I'm going to Fuzzy's house."
Gumball says: "So have fun being more jelly than a peanut-butter sandwich!"
Gumball says: "What's that?"
Darwin says: "The needle on my give-a-darn-ometer—"
Darwin says: "not moving."
Gumball says: "Ugh."
Gumball says: "Look, you can still come if you want."
Darwin says: "What was that?"
Darwin says: "Sorry."
Darwin says: "I just wanted to make sure I didn't look like I gave a darn."
Gumball says: "I said you can—"
Darwin says: "Hello?"
Darwin says: "Is this the give-a-darn store?"
Darwin says: "Uh, yeah, I'd like to know if you had any more darns left in stock."
Darwin says: "Yeah, it's for a friend."
Darwin says: "Oh, you discontinued the line?"
Darwin says: "I see."
Darwin says: "Oh, you might have some left in the warehouse?"
Darwin says: "Sure."
Darwin says: "I'll hold."
Darwin says: "Just a sec."
Darwin says: "Ah, right."
Darwin says: "Mm."
Going to Fuzzy's House.
Gumball and Fuzzy walk through the streets outside.
Gumball says: "And then he was talking about how the darn mines had closed and that I should've invested in renewable darns and—"
Gumball says: "whatever."
Gumball says: "Anyways, is your place very far?"
Gumball says: "'Cause we've been walking for an hour now."
Fuzzy says: "Oh, yeah, it's right around the corner..."
Gumball says: "Good."
Fuzzy says: "..."
Fuzzy says: "after the lake."
Gumball says: "Right."
Gumball says: "Um, wait, Elmore's got a lake?"
Fuzzy says: "No."
Gumball says: "Hmph."
Gumball and Fuzzy are shown walking through the desert near an overpass.
Gumball says: "Dude, can we at least make a pit stop?"
Gumball says: "I need a new pair of feet!"
Fuzzy says: "Oh, but we're nearly there."
Gumball says: "Ugh."
Gumball says: "Where?"
Fuzzy says: "Just beyond that pass."
Gumball says: "The overpass?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Fuzzy says: "No, that mountain pass."
Gumball groans. They then are shown walking on a snowy mountain.
Fuzzy says: "Okay, maybe we need a little break."
Gumball says: "Oh, thank you, universe!"
Gumball ends up not sitting and lets out a frozen tear. They then walk over a grassy flatland, as Gumball's eyelids are letting out a farting sound.
Fuzzy says: "What's that sound?"
Gumball says: "I'm crying, but I'm so dehydrated, only air is coming out."
In a mysterious forest in the night, Gumball and Fuzzy are still walking. Gumball collapses.
Gumball says: "I'm not gonna make it, Fuzzy."
Gumball says: "You're gonna have to continue without me."
Fuzzy says: "Gumball, I'm not leaving you behind."
Gumball says: "I never said leave me behind."
Gumball says: "I meant you're gonna do the rest off the walking, get some form of wheel-based transportation, and come back to get me."
Gumball says: "Also, I want a burrito."
Fuzzy says: "But it's just right there, right before Ontario."
Gumball says: "Wait, are you telling me we're in Minnesota right now?"
Fuzzy says: "Come on."
Fuzzy says: "We're right there."
Gumball says: "NO!"
Gumball says: "FORGET THIS!"
Gumball says: "FORGET YOU!"
Gumball says: "FORGET MINNESOTA!"
Gumball says: "FORGET EVERYTHING!"
Fuzzy says: "Okay, I'll just wait for you inside, then."
Gumball says: "Oh, all right, then."
Gumball enters the house.
Gumball says: "Huh."
Gumball says: "Weird."
Gumball says: "Looks exactly like your old bedroom."
Fuzzy says: "Welcome back, Gumball."
Gumball says: "What the what is going on here?"
Fuzzy says: "You abandoned me, Gumball."
Fuzzy says: "You promised we would stay BFFs forever, but you replaced me."
Fuzzy says: "Put this on."
Gumball says: "What?"
Gumball says: "But it's for toddlers, it's too small."
Fuzzy says: "Put it on!"
Fuzzy says: "Now you're gonna make up for it, starting right where we left off, and life is gonna be one long sleepover."
Fuzzy says: "Aah!"
Gumball says: "Darwin!"
Gumball says: "What are you doing here?"
Darwin says: "I knew there was something creepy going on with this guy, so I followed you."
Gumball says: "'Kay."
Gumball says: "Why'd you dig a hole, though?"
Darwin says: "Oh, um, to bury the hatchet?"
Gumball says: "Oh my gosh."
Gumball says: "You were so jealous you were gonna whack this guy!"
Darwin says: "Yeah, right."
Darwin says: "I'm jealous."
Darwin says: "I'm jealous of Fuzzy."
Darwin says: "I'm jealous of his relationship with you."
Darwin says: "I'm jealous that Fuzzy will go back to being your BFF, and you'll abandon me."
Gumball says: "A-are you still being sarcastic, or—"
Darwin says: "Ha!"
Darwin says: "Yeah, sure."
Darwin says: "I'm being sarcastic."
Gumball says: "So you're being sarcastic about being sarcastic."
Darwin says: "Yeah, I'm just jealous, basically."
Gumball says: "Aww, well, you shouldn't be."
Gumball says: "I love you, dude."
Darwin says: "I love you more."
Gumball says: "No, I love you more."
Fuzzy says: "No, you love me more!"
Gumball and Darwin scream.
Outrunning Fuzzy.
Fuzzy chases Gumball and Darwin through the woods. The brothers get behind a branch.
Gumball says: "There!"
Gumball says: "Get behind me."
Gumball and Darwin try to launch the branch toward Fuzzy but it ends up snapping, propelling the boys backwards.
Gumball says: "Ugh!"
Darwin says: "Ugh!"
Gumball says: "Oh."
Darwin says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "He's coming!"
Gumball and Darwin run up to a cliff and scream as they look down. They look behind them, and Fuzzy comes closer.
Darwin says: "We got no choice!"
They jump off the cliff, at the same time making loser signs to Fuzzy. Once they fall in the river, Fuzzy checks on their absence, and Gumball and Darwin try to hit him off with a log, screaming. They hit two rocks and get pinned underneath.
Fuzzy says: "I'm sorry, Darwin, but there can only be one BFF."
Hank says: "Yeah, me."
Fuzzy says: "Wha—"
Fuzzy says: "oh!"
Gumball says: "Who—"
Gumball says: "who are you?"
Hank says: "Hank."
Hank says: "I was Fuzzy's BFF, and now, I'm taking him back."
Gumball says: "Sure."
Gumball says: "That's cool."
Hank carries Fuzzy away.
Fuzzy says: "Help, help!"
Fuzzy is carried off-screen. The brothers push the log off of them.
Darwin says: "So..."
Darwin says: "should we go help Fuzzy, or..."
Gumball says: "Or not?"
Darwin says: "Yeah, I mean, it's late."
Gumball says: "We are far from home."
Darwin says: "I'm hungry."
Gumball says: "Well, I saw a really good taco truck on the way."
Darwin says: "Where?"
Gumball says: "Eh, somewhere near Wyoming."
The episode ends.
