Put the Game On!
The Wattersons' house, Gumball and Darwin are holding a game cartridge.
Gumball says: "Look, Darwin."
Gumball says: "We waited more than seven months for this."
Darwin says: "I know!"
Darwin says: "We waited so long, I had time to grow hair."
Gumball says: "Huh?"
Darwin shows his leg, which is covered in thick hair.
Gumball says: "Whoa."
Gumball says: "May I touch it?"
Darwin says: "You may."
Gumball says: "Nice."
Darwin says: "Thanks."
Darwin says: "Come on!"
Darwin says: "Put the game on!"
Gumball says: "There's something wrong with it!"
Gumball tries again, to no avail.
Darwin says: "Come on!"
Darwin says: "Can't you see I'm practically flipping my flippers?"
Gumball says: "What is that supposed to mean?"
Darwin says: "IT MEANS PUT THE GAME ON!"
Gumball says: "I can't!"
Gumball says: "It's not working!"
Darwin stops flipping his flippers.
Gumball says: "I think we got stiffed."
At Ripley 2000.
Larry says: "I'm sorry, kids, but it's store policy."
Larry says: "I can't give you a refund."
Gumball says: "What?"
Gumball says: "You have to!"
Gumball says: "We asked you a ton of questions before we bought it, remember?"
Gumball says: "What's bigger—"
Gumball says: "a lion or a tiger?"
Larry says: "A tiger."
Gumball says: "Why is the sky blue?"
Larry says: "Diffraction of light through nitrogen."
Darwin says: "Can anything escape from a black hole?"
Larry says: "Not unless it's a superheated quasar."
Gumball says: "What is 2,352 times 1,035?"
Larry says: "2,434,320."
Gumball says: "If you know all this stuff, how come you're a store clerk?"
Larry says: "Look, you want this game or not?"
Gumball says: "We'll take it."
Back to present time.
Larry says: "Actually, you never asked me anything about the game."
Gumball says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "You're right."
Gumball says: "But whatever!"
Gumball says: "You have to give us a refund!"
Gumball says: "It's been less than twenty-four hours!"
Larry says: "Look, guys, if it was up to me, I'd totally give you a refund,  I- I'm sorry, but that's the way it is."
Larry says: "Thanks for shopping at Ripley 2000."
Gumball and Darwin start to make their way out of the store.
Gumball says: "This is not the end of it, Larry Needlemeyer!"
Gumball says: "Mark my words!"
Gumball says: "We will get a refund!"
They angrily leave the store, then immediately come back inside in a happy mood.
Gumball says: "Hi, Larry."
Gumball says: "Can we have a refund, please?"
Larry says: "Get out of here!"
They stomp out of the store again.
Gumball says: "Ripley 2000."
Gumball says: "More like "Rip-off" 2000!"
Darwin says: "Why is it 2000, anyway?"
Darwin says: "It's not like it's the future anymore."
Plan B.
The shop's phone rings.
Gumball says: "This is the police!"
Gumball says: "You're surrounded!"
Gumball says: "Put your hands where I can see them!"
Larry puts his hands up.
Gumball says: "Now put your hands on the cash register and take out twenty dollars!"
Larry tries to grab the cash register.
Gumball says: "Now come outside and swap it for this computer game!"
Larry says: "Hey!"
Larry says: "What kind of police are you?"
Gumball says: "The..."
Gumball says: "super-real police."
Gumball says: "The..."
Gumball says: "refund department..."
Gumball says: "of justice!"
Larry says: "Nice try, kids."
Plan C.
Gumball and Darwin go into the store.
Larry says: "Oh, look, kids, I'm not gonna give you a refund."
Gumball says: "We're not here to ask for a refund."
Gumball says: "We just want you to look at my new, shiny watch."
Larry says: "I, uh, it's kind of hard when you..."
Larry says: "swing..."
Larry says: "it..."
Larry says: "like..."
Larry says: "that."
Darwin says: "Did it work?"
Darwin says: "Is he hypnotized?"
Gumball says: "Let's test it."
Gumball says: "Okay."
Gumball says: "You're the world's most amazing dancer."
Larry performs a short ballet routine, and Gumball and Darwin laugh.
Gumball says: "Okay, now..."
Gumball says: "now you're an ostrich."
Darwin says: "No, a gorilla!"
Gumball says: "A gorilla ostrich!"
Larry acts like a gorilla and an ostrich, Gumball and Darwin laugh.
Darwin says: "Now you have roller skates on!"
Larry starts slipping on rollerskates, still acting as a gorilla and an ostrich.
Gumball says: "And your butt's on fire!"
Larry shouts like a monkey and slaps his own butt as if trying to put off a fire, Gumball and Darwin laugh even harder, and then Larry crashes into a table with a pile of radios on top.
Gumball says: "And now you're a store clerk giving us a refund?"
Larry says: "Sorry."
Larry says: "It's against store policy."
Gumball says: "Now your butt's on fire again."
Larry says: "Aaaaaaaaah!"
Plan D.
Gumball and Darwin enter Ripley 2000 again, with confident, smug faces and a TV.
Larry says: "Oh, come on."
Larry says: "I told you—"
Larry says: "no refund."
Gumball says: "Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
Gumball says: "We're not going to ask you for a refund."
Gumball says: "We just want two minutes of your time."
Darwin turns on the TV, showing a video.
Gumball says: "Every year, hundreds of children buy faulty computer games and don't get refunds."
Gumball says: "Jimmy really needed a refund, but the store manager wouldn't give it to him."
Darwin says: "I don't care that you're sad, Jimmy."
Darwin says: "It's store policy!"
Gumball says: "Jimmy's life is now very bad,  I know you're sad and lonely."
Music starts playing.
Darwin says: "Refund the world."
Darwin says: "Refund it sooner."
Gumball says: "Uphold the rights that little Jimmy had as a consumer."
Darwin says: "Now he's living in a box."
Gumball says: "He's a victim of deceit."
Gumball says: "And even though he still had the receipt."
Darwin says: "And even though he still had the receipt."
The song ends shortly, back to the store.
Larry says: "Is there anything I can do?"
Gumball says: "Well, you could look into your heart and..."
Gumball says: "Give us a refund?"
Darwin says: "Give us a refund?"
Larry says: "I'm sorry, but no."
Gumball says: "Oh!"
Gumball says: "You can just stop all this suffering with just one word!"
Gumball says: "Aah!"
Gumball says: "Oh!"
Larry says: "Okay, okay!"
Larry says: "Please stop."
Larry says: "Look, maybe I could—"
Larry says: "I'm sorry, but "no" means "no."
At Home.
Gumball and Darwin come home, Richard is sitting on the sofa.
Richard says: "Hey, kids!"
Richard says: "What's up?"
Gumball says: "We couldn't get a refund, and now we're really cheesed off."
Richard says: "Watch your language, young man!"
Richard says: ""Cheese" is not to be invoked in vain in this house!"
Richard says: "But if it's a refund you're after, you've came to the right place—"
Richard says: "person—"
Richard says: "man—"
Richard says: "rabbit."
Gumball says: "Really?"
Gumball says: "Let's go there right now!"
Richard says: "Wait."
Richard says: "If you're going to do something, you got to do it right."
Richard says: "Heh!"
Richard gets off the sofa, rips off his shirt, and puts on a black vest. He then draws a tattoo of a deadly unicorn with "Nicole" on it on his arm using a pen, and after he does that, he grows a pair of wild mutton chops sideburns.
Richard says: "Now how do I look?"
Gumball says: "Actually, you look like your wedding picture."
Richard says: "Perfect."
Richard says: "Now, hand me that game."
Back at Ripley 2000.
Richard stares at Larry.
Larry says: "What do you want from me, you nut burger?!"
Larry says: "!"
Richard says: "Oh, you know what we want."
Gumball says: "We want what's rightfully ours, and we brought our dad!"
Richard says: "Exactly."
Larry says: "For the last time, I can't!"
Richard says: "Uhp!"
Richard says: "I wish to speak to your manager."
Larry says: "But you don't realize—"
Larry says: "he's a vile, cruel beast!"
Larry says: "Uh, sorry."
Larry says: "No refund."
Richard says: "Shhh."
Richard says: "Tch, tch, tch."
Richard says: "Okay."
Richard says: "Here's what's gonna happen."
Richard says: "I'm gonna return this game and get a refund."
Richard says: "Look."
Richard says: "I'm putting the game on the counter."
Larry says: "B-But—"
Richard says: "Easy."
Richard says: "Easy, pal."
Richard says: "Now, I'm opening the register."
Larry says: "No, no, no!"
Larry says: "Sir, sir, sir, I wouldn't do that if I were you!"
Richard says: "Well, lucky for me, I'm not you."
Richard says: "So now I'm going to take what you owe us."
Richard says: "See my hand?"
Richard says: "Slowly, slowly."
Gumball says: "Wait."
Gumball says: "Isn't that, like, stealing?"
Larry says: "But you don't understand!"
Larry says: "You can't take money out of the register!"
Larry says: "You can only put it in!"
Richard pulls a twenty dollar bill out of the register, the alarm starts to sound.
Larry says: "Nooooooo!"
Larry says: "We're doomed!"
Richard says: "Aah!"
Richard says: "What's going on?!"
Richard says: "!"
Larry says: "He's coming!"
Richard says: "Who's coming?!"
Richard says: "!"
Larry says: "The manager!"
Richard says: "Aaaah!"
Richard says: "I'm putting it back!"
Richard says: "I'm putting it back!"
Richard says: "I'm putting it back!"
Richard says: "It's not even my fault!"
Richard says: "It's their fault!"
Gumball says: "What?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "When you said you'd get us a refund, we didn't expect you to steal from the register!"
Richard says: "You know very well I can't be trusted!"
Close-up of the doorknob turning.
Richard says: "Aaaaah!"
The door opens, revealing that the manager is tiny.
The Manager.
Richard walks to the manager, and laughs at him.
Richard says: "Look at you!"
Richard says: "I thought you were going to be some huge dude!"
Richard says: "Phew!"
Richard says: "So, can we have our refund now?"
Manager says: "No refund!"
Richard says: "Oh, come on."
Richard says: "We've all had a laugh and a little fright, but I think it's time to just give us our money back, and we'll be on our way."
Manager says: "I've had it with you and your brats trying to mess with my money!"
Manager says: "You think you can steal from me and laugh in my face?"
Richard says: "Oh, you're adorable!"
Richard says: "But, seriously, though, you don't want this to get physical."
Richard says: "You're lucky I'm a pacifist."
The manager angrily pounces onto Richard's arm and bites him.
Richard says: "Ow."
Richard says: "Ow!"
Richard says: "Get him off!"
Richard says: "Get him off!"
Richard says: "Get him off!"
Gumball says: "Go, Dad!"
Darwin says: "Go, Dad!"
Gumball says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Darwin says: "Whoo-hoo!"
The manager crawls into Richard's vest.
Gumball says: "Come on, Dad!"
Darwin says: "Come on, Dad!"
Gumball says: "You got him!"
Darwin says: "You got him!"
The manager crawls down Richard's pants.
Richard says: "He's inside my pants!"
Richard says: "Aaaah!"
Gumball says: "Get him out!"
Darwin says: "Yeah, kick his butt, Dad!"
Gumball says: "Come on, Dad!"
Gumball says: "You can take him!"
The manager pulls on Richard's ears.
Gumball says: "Dad?"
Richard says: "Get him off!"
Richard says: "Get him off!"
Richard says: "Aah!"
Richard says: "Ow!"
Darwin says: "He's not winning, is he?"
Gumball says: "No."
The manager begins hitting Richard's head rapidly.
Richard says: "What's wrong with you?"
Richard says: "Ow!"
Richard says: "Ow!"
Richard says: "Doesn't really hurt that much."
Richard says: "But ow!"
The manager repeatedly slaps Richard's face with his own hands.
Richard says: "Oh, no!"
Richard says: "My beautiful face!"
Richard says: "Gumball!"
Richard says: "Darwin!"
Richard says: "Do something!"
Gumball says: "Eh, this is getting kind of embarrassing."
Gumball and Darwin walk towards the door.
Gumball and Darwin return.
Gumball says: "Stop right there, little man!"
Darwin says: "Yeah!"
Darwin says: "Leave Mr."
Darwin says: "Dad alone!"
Darwin says: "Otherwise..."
Manager says: "Otherwise what?"
Gumball says: "Otherwise, we'll put the security video online."
Gumball says: "What do you think the internet will say when it sees you slapping your customers with your little hands?"
Manager says: "That it's pretty funny?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, it was pretty funny."
Gumball says: "But you'll probably get a modest fine and a couple of days of community service."
Manager says: "So?"
Gumball says: "So the shop will be closed."
Manager says: "And?"
Gumball says: "And you'll lose money."
Manager says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Manager says: "No need to get excited."
Manager says: "Okay, look, I can't give you a refund."
Manager says: "It's a matter of principle."
Manager says: "But since I find you quite pathetic, I'll give you a 1% discount on this new games console."
Manager says: "That way, you can play the game you've already got."
Manager says: "What do you say?"
Gumball says: "Hmm."
Gumball says: "1%."
Gumball says: "So, $700."
Gumball says: "That's, like, $7 off!"
Richard says: "Now, that's what I call a bargain!"
Darwin says: "Can we have your credit card, Mr."
Darwin says: "Dad?"
Richard says: "Totally."
Gumball says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Darwin says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Richard says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Back at Home.
Richard says: "Ugh!"
Richard says: "Can't believe I got beat up by a garden gnome."
Gumball says: "Oh, come on."
Gumball says: "It was pretty funny."
Darwin says: "Like when you were screaming, "no, no, my beautiful face!"
Gumball says: "And when he was pounding on you from above and it looked like a tennis ball bouncing on a melon."
The three laugh.
Richard says: "And thanks to me, we did get a huge discount on the console."
Darwin says: "Come on!"
Darwin says: "Put the game on!"
Gumball says: "Yes!"
Gumball inserts the game cartridge into the slot, but it is then unexpectedly shredded to pieces.
Gumball says: "Dad, he sold us a shredder."
Richard spawns his mutton chops sideburns again.
Episode ends.
