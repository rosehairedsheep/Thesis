What Is Going On?!
The episode starts on the school bus. Gumball is eating an ice cream sundae.
Gumball says: "I'm just saying, how did anybody ever name anything?"
Gumball says: "Was some caveman like,  "Deal!"
Gumball says: "" There needs to be some logic so you know what stuff is for!"
Gumball says: "I would've called them mouth shovels."
Darwin says: "Agreed."
Darwin says: "Like..."
Darwin says: "moths should be called goth butterflies!"
Gumball says: "Beards should be called mouth curtains!"
Darwin says: "Puppies should be called doglets!"
Darwin says: "But what about stuff that doesn't already have a name?"
Darwin says: "Like..."
Darwin says: "that stage you're in when you go to pee-pee in the night but you're still trying to stay asleep so you can go back to bed right away?"
Gumball says: "Hmmm..."
Darwin says: "Hmmm..."
Gumball says: "Sleep-pee-peeing!"
Darwin says: "Sleep-pee-peeing!"
Later, in the music room, Gumball and Darwin are bored.
Gumball says: "What do you reckon would be your music fish name?"
Gumball says: "Cod Cobain?"
Darwin says: "Lil Whale?"
Gumball says: "Sharkira?"
Darwin says: "Salmon and Carpfunkel?"
At lunch, in the cafeteria.
Gumball says: "Dude, this pizza is so frozen I can't tell if that's Parmesan or ice crystals!"
Darwin says: "And this pepperoni is saltier than texting the letter K as a reply!"
Gumball says: "Yeah!"
Gumball says: "And this corn is—"
Gumball says: "Dude, I—"
Gumball says: "I can't think of anything!"
Darwin says: "Try harder!"
Gumball says: "Aaaahhhh—"
Darwin says: "Okay, I'll try to come up with something to say then."
Gumball says: "Dude."
Gumball says: "What is going on?!"
Darwin says: "What is going on?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "!"
That night, they are still trying to come up with something to say, but only end up crumpling themselves up.
Gumball says: "One last time."
Darwin says: "Gumball!"
Darwin says: "What's happening to us?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Gumball says: "I don't know, man!"
Gumball says: "It's like we've run out of things to say to each other!"
Therapy with Mr. Wilson.
Gumball and Darwin are at Harold Wilson's psychotherapy office. The boys are sitting on a couch, and Harold shows them a picture of a house.
Harold​​​​​​ says: "Try to think of your relationship in terms of a house."
Harold​​​​​​ says: "You need to have strong foundations, ideally with a man-cave."
Harold​​​​​​ says: "You also need space."
Harold​​​​​​ says: "Two stories with a screening room for movie night should do, right?"
Gumball says: "Yeah..."
Darwin says: "Yeah..."
Harold​​​​​​ says: "And how about a hot tub for the winter?"
Harold​​​​​​ says: "And a swimming pool for summer!"
Gumball says: "Yeah!"
Darwin says: "Yeah!"
Harold​​​​​​ says: "Great!"
Harold​​​​​​ says: "Now, let me talk you through the process."
Harold​​​​​​ says: "We start with you as you are right now, with a problem."
Harold​​​​​​ says: "Then we exchange."
Harold​​​​​​ says: "Then you leave happily."
Harold​​​​​​ says: "Does that sound good?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, I think so!"
Darwin says: "Yeah, I think so!"
Harold​​​​​​ says: "Great!"
Harold​​​​​​ says: "So let's exchange."
Gumball says: "Well, it seems we've run out of things to say, and—"
Harold​​​​​​ says: "B-b-b-b-bep."
Harold​​​​​​ says: "I meant exchange my services for your money."
Gumball says: "Oh, sorry."
Gumball says: "Yes, of course."
Harold​​​​​​ says: "Very good."
Gumball says: "So, yeah, this never used to happen to us, but now it's like—"
Harold​​​​​​ says: "And now, goodbye."
Gumball says: "W-wait!"
Gumball says: "What about all that "building a house" stuff?"
Harold​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Oh, we're building all right."
Harold​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "My pool house!"
An "Alternative" Approach.
Gumball and Darwin are crossing the street.
Darwin says: "Okay, what if we try something a little more..."
Darwin says: "off the charts?"
Gumball says: "No."
Gumball says: "Please."
Gumball says: "Not him."
Darwin says: "Look, science'll let us down!"
Darwin says: "We might as well give him a chance."
Gumball says: "Please."
Gumball says: "Don't say it!"
Darwin says: "Alternative..."
Gumball says: "No!"
Gumball says: "Please!"
Gumball says: "NO!"
Darwin says: "Alternative..."
Darwin says: "medicine."
A cloud of dust rushes forward, blowing through everything in its path. It's Mr. Small, zooming towards them like a bullet. He dives up and lands right in between them.
Mister Small says: "Did someone say..."
Mister Small says: "alternative medicine?"
The three are now sitting on yoga mats in a grassy patch by the forest.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "So, you're saying you have no wind in your sails."
Darwin says: "Yes."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "The train won't leave the station."
Darwin says: "Yes."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "The goose is stuck in the hammock."
Darwin says: "Yes..."
Darwin says: "."
Darwin says: "?"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "The potato is wedged in your tailpipe."
Darwin says: "I'm not sure what we're talking about anymore."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You've got trouble talking."
Darwin says: "Yes."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Hmm..."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I see."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I think we need to release the holisticness of your third eye chakras in order to boost your auras and stimulate the flow of chi to your tongue."
Darwin says: "What does that mean?"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "It means this."
Gumball and Darwin are now covered in acupuncture needles and surrounded by healing crystals. Smoke is coming off of them.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "How do you feel?"
Gumball says: "Like I got punctured two hundred times and set on fire."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I meant between the two of you."
Gumball says: "Uh-a..."
Gumball says: "ugh..."
Gumball says: "No..."
Gumball says: "still got nothing to say to him."
Darwin says: "Me neither."
Gumball says: "Wait."
Gumball says: "Wait!"
Gumball says: "I can feel something coming!"
Darwin says: "Yeah!"
Darwin says: "Me too!"
Darwin says: "It's like my tongue is tingling!"
They open their mouths eagerly, expecting to say something, but after a long period of time, their tongues rapidly inflate in the shape of noses. each an inside-out nose.
Gumball says: "Mr."
Gumball says: "Small!"
Gumball says: "What's going on?"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Hmm."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "That's really weird."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I've done this procedure three times before and all my other patients had exactly the same result."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "What are the odds?"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Once they accepted that this was their life now."
Cut to Gumball and Darwin at night, walking out of a shady "doctor's office" in an alleyway, looking scarred.
Gumball says: "You know, Darwin?"
Gumball says: "As that backstreet doctor was finally draining the excess fluid out of our screaming faces using that grease-coated bicycle pump, I had an eye-opening moment."
Darwin says: "Tell me about it."
Darwin says: "My eyes are still popping out in shock."
Gumball says: "No, I mean that man had no diploma."
Gumball says: "He was just pretending to be a doctor."
Darwin says: "So?"
Gumball says: "So what if we pretended too?"
Keeping It Interesting.
The next afternoon. Gumball and Darwin are walking down the sidewalk.
Darwin says: "I don't get it!"
Gumball says: "Well, you know how we can't keep up with conversa..."
Gumball says: ".."
Darwin says: "Yeah, it goes limper than an animator's handshake."
Gumball says: "Exactly."
Gumball says: "But what if it wasn't us doing the talking?"
Darwin says: "What do you mean?"
Cut to the two in their bedroom, both on laptops.
Gumball says: "Roleplaying!"
Gumball says: "If it works for fedora wizards in some basement, why not us?"
Darwin says: "Who are you gonna be, then?"
Gumball says: "I'm Akane Ryuuku."
Gumball says: "A shy anime kawaii girl who likes corgis and friendship."
Darwin says: "Okay, let's go."
Darwin says: "Hey!"
Gumball says: "Oh..."
Gumball says: "H-hey."
Gumball says: "I'm Akane-chan."
Gumball says: "I'm not used to talk to people."
Gumball says: "Heh-heh!"
Gumball says: "Asterisk, blushes and turns away."
Darwin says: "Congratulations!"
Darwin says: "You've win E-phone black edition!"
Gumball says: "Sugoi!"
Gumball says: "Thank you, Sleve McDichael sempai!"
Gumball says: "It's the first time someone makes Akane-chan a present."
Gumball says: "Asterisk, looks away all flustered."
Gumball says: "You want to be friends with Akane?"
Darwin says: "Chat with me now and win dollars, dollars, dollars!"
Gumball says: "What?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "Click link and talk!"
Gumball shrugs and clicks the link, but it opens an influx of viruses. His laptop starts snapping at him, steals his wallet, and then explodes.
Gumball says: "DUDE!!"
Gumball says: "WHAT THE WHAT WERE YOU ROLEPLAYING?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "A bot!"
Later, they are eating. They both try to come up with something, but fail once again. Nicole walks up to Richard, who is lying on the couch.
Nicole says: "Richard honey, if it's pretty much all you do, you need to watch the way you sit."
Nicole says: "You should have a straight back and your knees at a 90-degree angle."
Nicole says: "It's important for your legs and hips to be in the correct position."
Richard​ says: "Uhh."
Nicole says: "Ugh."
Nicole says: "Still some kind of improvement, I guess."
In the dining room. Gumball slams his hands on the table.
Gumball says: "Dude!"
Gumball says: "That's it!"
Gumball says: "Maybe all it takes is for us to change position a little!"
They are both standing upside down.
Gumball says: "Uh, do you feel anything?"
Darwin says: "No."
They are lying down with their feet against each other's faces.
Gumball says: "How about now?"
Darwin says: "No."
Darwin says: "Maybe a little shame."
Now Gumball is kneeling and Darwin has his foot on Gumball's face.
Gumball says: "No?"
Darwin says: "No."
Now Gumball's head is inside Darwin's mouth.
Gumball says: "No?"
Darwin says: "No."
They rapidly go through many other positions.
Gumball says: "No?"
Darwin says: "No."
Gumball says: "How's that?"
Darwin says: "Look."
Gumball says: "What?"
Darwin says: "Maybe what we really need is..."
Gumball says: "Please!"
Gumball says: "Don't say it."
Darwin says: "I have to!"
Gumball says: "Please don't!"
Darwin says: "I have to!"
Darwin says: "Otherwise you won't actually know what I mean."
Gumball says: "I already know what you're gonna say."
Gumball says: "You mean..."
Out Of Sync.
