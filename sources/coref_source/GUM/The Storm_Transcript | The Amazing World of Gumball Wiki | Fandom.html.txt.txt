The Perfect Couple.
The episode begins in the Elmore Junior High Cafeteria. Gumball and Darwin are eating together; Alan and Carmen are nearby, also eating together.
Carmen says: "You're the chocolate chips in my cookie."
Alan says: "You're the cream in my doughnut."
Carmen says: "You're the syrup in my pancakes."
Both laugh.
Gumball says: "Oh, that's disgusting!"
Darwin says: "Aw, c'mon."
Darwin says: "I think it's cute that they're eating from the same plate."
Gumball says: "Dude, there's nothing cute about that."
Alan and Carmen slurp spaghetti together, with Alan eating through his knot.
Darwin says: "You're so intolerant!"
Darwin says: "How else is he supposed to eat?"
Gumball says: "It's not that, what annoys me is how sickeningly in love Carmen and Alan are."
Alan​​​​​​​ says: "No, I love you more because I also love, loving you—"
Gumball interferes.
Gumball says: "Sorry to interrupt."
Gumball says: "But can you please stop this?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Alan​​​​​​​ says: "What?"
Gumball says: "This!"
Gumball says: "This hideous picture of happiness!"
Masami, Carrie and Leslie chime in, agreeing with Gumball.
Gumball says: "I'm so sick of your stupid pet names and your gross lovey-dovey faces."
Gumball says: "You don't see me and Penny acting like that."
Darwin says: "That's because you're not going out with her."
Gumball says: "Exactly."
Idaho says: "You two are so beautiful, it makes me believe I, too, can find love."
Idaho says: "But when I look in the mirror, I realize I'm just a dirt covered ball of starch!"
Alan moves to Idaho.
Alan​​​​​​​ says: "But Idaho, if you wanna be loved..."
Alan​​​​​​​ says: "first, you gotta love yourself."
Leslie​​​​​​​ says: "Yeah!"
Leslie​​​​​​​ says: "You're so nice and sensitive too I can't even hate you!"
Masami says: "You're so perfect, it makes me wanna rain on your parade until you swell up, turn brown, and rot!"
Carrie is confused, while everyone is silent.
Carrie says: "Uhhhh..."
Carrie says: "I think what Masami is trying to say is that you guys are so perfect, it kinda makes us wish for your downfall."
Masami says: "Uh-huh, why don't you go and be perfect somewhere else?"
Idaho says: "Yeah."
Leslie​​​​​​​ says: "Well said, Carrie."
Everyone walks away except Alan, Carmen and Gumball. Gumball looks guilty.
Helping Carmen.
Carmen is seen crying while looking at the picture of Carmen and Alan on her locker.
Gumball says: "Uhh, Carmen?"
Gumball says: "Aaahh, I should've seen that coming!"
Carmen faces Gumball, looking as if she wants help from him.
Gumball says: "Are you crying?"
Carmen says: "Yes!"
Gumball says: "But, you don't have tears."
Carmen says: "I tend to retain water."
Gumball says: "Look, I'm really sorry."
Gumball says: "I don't know why I said all that stuff."
Darwin says: "Because you're a gutless coward, who has to ruin other people's lives because he's too much of a chicken to ask Penny out?"
Gumball says: "You're so perceptive!"
Gumball says: "I'm surprised you didn't see this coming."
Gumball kicks Darwin in the knee. Darwin yelps in pain, rubbing his knee.
Carmen says: "But Gumball, I'm not crying because what you said was mean."
Carmen says: "I'm crying because it's true!"
Carmen says: "Our love is so perfect and it's becoming boring!"
Carmen continues to sniff. Darwin shrugs.
Gumball says: "Well, I'd love to help—"
Carmen says: "Great!"
Gumball's eyes become dots.
The Break-Up.
The playground. Carmen who is smiling, Gumball, and Darwin are walking. Tobias and Juke are playing basketball in the background while Alan is glaring at Carmen and Gumball.
Gumball says: "Carmen, you know when people say "I'd love to help," that usually means, "I don't want anything to do with it."
Gumball says: "I can't do that!"
Gumball says: "What if Penny is watching?"
Darwin says: "I've got this."
Penny and Leslie are seated on a bench. Penny has a cup of milkshake with her.
Leslie​ says: "And she was like "Mwah," and he was like "Mwah," and I was like."
Penny says: "I have no idea what you're talking about."
Darwin says: "Hey Penny, I bet you a quarter you can't copy everything I do."
Penny says: "Hmm..."
Penny says: "Okay."
Penny sets down her milkshake and confronts Darwin. She copies him perfectly, until Darwin grabs her drink and sips from the straw. When Penny copies him, Darwin pretends to swallow, and Penny falls for the trick, so Darwin spits out the drink on Penny.
Penny says: "Well played, sir."
Penny says: "Now I'm going to clean up myself if you don't mind."
Penny leaves, and Leslie makes a mad face at Darwin. Darwin winks at Gumball.
Gumball says: "Okay, I think that's enough now."
Gumball says: "If he keeps looking at me like that, I think my head's going to explode!"
Alan glares at Gumball.
Carmen says: "Compliment me."
Gumball says: "Okay, I really like your face because it's not complicated."
Gumball says: "And I like your name, Carmen, it sounds like a superhero who sort of drives a lot."
Gumball says: "Also, your branches are really cool, it's like two arms raised, makes you look like you're always winning."
Gumball says: "Or you look like you're wearing one of those giant cowboy hats."
Shot cuts to Alan still glaring.
Carmen says: "Awww, he's not doing anything!"
Scene cuts back to Carmen and Gumball.
Carmen says: "Kiss me."
Gumball's eyes enlarge.
Carmen says: "Come on, I'm not that bad!"
Gumball says: "Look, I always thought the first girl I would kiss would be Penny."
Gumball says: "We'd be on a beach at sunset."
Gumball says: "Some fireflies would make a love heart around us, and there would be some sort of violin involved."
Gumball says: "just to make another dude jealous!"
Tobias and Juke pause their game to stare to Gumball. Tobias mistakenly hits the the pole with a basketball and it bounces away from them, towards Gumball.
Gumball says: "Gumball Watterson might be a lot of things, but he is not a cheap, corruptible bimbo!"
The basketball hits Gumball in the back of his head, causing him to fall forward and face plant into Carmen's face, and while doing so, accidentally kisses her on the face. Tobias, Juke, Alan, Leslie, and Carmen stare at him in shock. The camera then reveals Banana Joe, Anton, Idaho, and Carrie, who stare in shock at Gumball as well. Then Gumball squeals in pain. At that moment, Penny returns, all cleaned up.
Darwin says: "Uhh, look a diversion!"
Penny simply looks at Darwin suspiciously, so Darwin spills the milkshake on her face again. Penny sighs as she goes back inside again. Gumball silently cries.
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Goodbye, Carmen."
Carmen pushes Gumball away angrily.
Gumball says: "Ow."
Carmen says: "He didn't do anything!"
Gumball says: "What did you think he was gonna do?"
Carmen says: "Something dramatic like punch your face in and drag me away screaming, but he just left me like he didn't even care!"
Gumball says: "Are you crying again?"
Carmen says: "Can't you tell?!"
Carmen says: "!"
Anton throws bread at Gumball.
Gumball says: "What the—"
Gumball says: "Hey!"
Anton says: "Shame on you, you dirty ol' girlfriend thief!"
Idaho says: "Couple splitter!"
Bobert says: "Catalyst of social discontent!"
Banana Joe says: "Homewrecker!"
Sussie says: "Names!"
Sussie says: "Names!"
Sussie says: "Names!"
Gumball says: "Hey, stop calling me names!"
Gumball says: "I thought you wanted them to split up anyway!"
Gumball says: "You hated them!"
Jamie says: "Yeah?"
Jamie says: "Well, now we hate you."
Carrie, Bobert, Jamie, Idaho and Anton storm off and Gumball sighs.
Balloon Biology.
The boys' restroom. Alan is heard crying while inflating and deflating inside a stall.
Gumball says: "Alan, is that you buddy?"
Deflating sound.
Gumball says: "Are you crying?"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "What does it sound like I'm doing?"
Gumball says: "I don't know man, you're a bit of a biological mystery."
Alan comes out of the stall.
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "What's so hard to understand?"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "It's not difficult, air goes in the knot, air goes out the knot."
Gumball says: "What about the spaghetti though?"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Spaghetti goes in, turns into air, comes back out."
Gumball says: "So technically, you weren't only crying just now."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Look, what do you want?"
Gumball says: "I want you to knock me out in the playground in front of everybody."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "What?"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Why?"
Gumball says: "Because that's what Carmen wanted, man."
Gumball says: "She wanted you to show some passion and you just bailed like a wet lettuce!"
Gumball says: "So man up, get out there and just pop me!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "There's no point, if I'm not able to make her happy, I refuse to stop her finding happiness somewhere else."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I love her too much for that."
Gumball says: "Wow, that was so cheesy I can actually smell it."
Masami's Plan.
The classroom. Miss Simian is giving lessons.
Lucy Simian says: "These two chemicals will be bound forever and nothing can pull them apart."
Tina says: "Apart from Gumball."
Ocho says: "And then he'll try to make out with the carbon."
Gumball sighs.
Penny says: "What are they talking about?"
Darwin splashes Penny again.
Penny says: "DARWIN!"
Masami says: "You know, Carmen's a pretty jealous girl."
Masami says: "You could use that to get them back together."
Gumball says: "Of course!"
Gumball says: "I'm gonna dress up as a girl and kiss Alan!"
Gumball says: "I need a really believable name though..."
Gumball says: "How 'bout "Barbara," or "Shatanya"..."
Gumball says: "Oh I know,  get outta here with your stupid idea!"
Masami says: "I meant, I could go out with him."
Gumball says: "Oh yeah, that is a good idea."
Gumball says: "But it'll never work, he's way too nice to do something like that."
Masami says: "Unless..."
Gumball says: "Could you write that, down?"
Moving On.
Gumball goes back in the boys' restroom to see Alan, almost completely deflated, lying on the toilet bowl.
Gumball says: "Duuude, pull yourself together man."
Gumball says: "You got to start dating again!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "What's the point?"
Gumball says: "Because..."
Gumball says: "Wait, that's my biology notes."
Gumball moves backwards while speaking his quote backwards too.
Gumball says: "Because..."
Gumball says: "you owe it to Carmen."
Gumball says: "If she sees you moving on, then she'll be able to do the same thing and find happiness she deserves!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You're right."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I'll do it for Carmen!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "But, who would date such a shriveled bag of sadness?"
Gumball says: "Well, no one."
Gumball says: "But, if you re-inflate, you can have a shot with Masami!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I don't think I have enough strength to inflate."
Alan and Gumball exit the boys' restroom. Alan has a pleased expression, and Gumball looks disgusted.
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Thanks, Gumball!"
Gumball says: "Whatever, man."
Operation Jealousy.
The playground. Students are chatting, when Bobert shows up.
Bobert says: "Attention, organic classmates."
Bobert says: "I have information about the relationship status of the gas-filled bag defined as Alan and the mass of condensation defined as Masami."
Bobert says: "It is on!"
Carrie, Jamie, Banana Joe, Tobias, and Hector gasp.
Teri says: "I'm so happy."
Teri says: "They've got so much in common."
Teri says: "They both float."
Teri says: "They..."
Teri says: "Actually, that's about it."
Teri says: "She's still better for him than Carmen is."
The students leave, except for a stunned Carmen. Gumball and Darwin peek from behind a recycling bin.
Gumball says: "Okay."
Gumball says: "First the shock and then the disbelief."
Gumball says: "All according to plan."
Carmen looks down in sadness.
Gumball says: "Now, come on!"
Gumball says: "Get angry and fight for your love!"
Carmen becomes red with anger for a moment.
Carmen says: "No!"
Darwin says: "Or just get depressed at the sudden realization that Gumball ruined your life."
It begins raining, and Carmen immediately swells up while still crying.
The Heart of the Storm.
The classroom. Only Alan and Masami are present, and Alan is repeatedly banging his head on the desk.
Masami says: "Are you even listening?"
Alan stops banging his head.
Alan​​​​​ says: "Whatever one will make Carmen think we're happy."
Masami says: "Ugh!"
Masami says: "Who cares about that prickly loser?"
Gumball suddenly appears, smacking Alan out of the way.
Gumball says: "We need to talk."
Gumball says: "Your plan completely bombed."
Gumball says: "Carmen didn't get jealous."
Gumball says: "She just looks really sad..."
Gumball says: "and turgid."
Masami says: "The plan worked perfectly."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Hey, I'm—"
Masami says: "Alan is finally with the right girl, the one who has always loved him."
Gumball gasps for a prolonged time, and he smacks Alan away, yet again.
Gumball says: "That's it!"
Gumball says: "I'm telling everyone."
Masami says: "No, you won't."
Masami says: "Unless you want Penny to find out you kissed Carmen."
Penny says: "Too late!"
Gumball says: "Uh!"
Penny is present at the door, scowling.
Penny says: "Darwin told me everything."
Darwin says: "Sorry, dude."
Darwin says: "I ran out of milkshake."
Gumball says: "Penny!"
Gumball says: "Please let me explain!"
Penny says: "Carmen already did."
Carmen says: "It was more of a head-butt than a kiss, to be honest."
Masami says: "It's too late for you, Carmen."
Masami says: "Alan is mine!"
Carmen says: "Please!"
Carmen says: "Masami, I love him!"
Masami says: "I love him more!"
Masami says: "And he loves me!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Can I—"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "just say—"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "something?!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "!"
Masami conjures up a hurricane in the classroom, blowing everyone and everything away.
Masami says: "NO!"
Masami says: "YOU'RE MINE!"
Gumball, Darwin, and Penny run out of the classroom. Masami, in the center of her hurricane, follows them, blasting the classroom entrance in the process. Alan is caught in her hurricane. Both run down the hall.
Carmen says: "AL-A-A-A-A-AN!"
Carmen says: "Gumball!"
Carmen says: "Do something!"
Gumball starts, but Penny halts him.
Penny says: "I think Gumball's made this situation bad enough."
Penny says: "Let me speak to her, girl to girl."
Walks down the hall and faces an unseen Masami.
Penny says: "Masami, look into your heart."
Penny says: "You're not a violent person!"
A bolt of lightning by Masami zaps her, knocking her down the other side of the hall.
Penny says: "Okay, Gumball."
Penny says: "Your turn."
Principal Brown and several students are having conversations. Masami's hurricane passes them, scrambling their artistic styles in the process. Gumball, Darwin, Penny, and Carmen chase her.
Gumball says: "Quick!"
Gumball says: "I've got an awesome idea!"
Gumball says: "Follow me to the fire hose!"
Cut to the kids holding a fire hose at the end of a hall. Gumball has the fire hose tied around his waist.
Gumball says: "Hold on."
Gumball says: "I'm the one who got the idea."
Gumball says: "It should be you guys making it happen."
Masami's hurricane violently approaches. Gumball whimpers.
Penny says: "Don't worry."
Penny says: "We'll pull you out."
Gumball says: "Wait."
Gumball says: "I got a better idea."
Penny says: "Too late."
Gumball says: "What the..."
Gumball gets caught in Masami's hurricane. Penny, Darwin, and Carmen hold onto the fire hose. They succeed in pulling both Gumball and Alan out of Masami's hurricane.
Gumball says: "Yeah!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Yeah!"
Gumball says: "We made it!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "We made it!"
They both laugh, until they realize parts of their features have been swapped.
Gumball says: "Aaaaaah!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Aaaaaah!"
Masami's hurricane dies out, leaving a still angry Masami.
Carmen says: "Run!"
Gumball says: "I can't!"
Gumball says: "I haven't got legs anymore!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "And I've never had any before!"
Masami says: "Give him back to me!"
Gumball and Alan have swapped their original parts back. They attempt to run, but Masami starts inhaling them in the opposite direction. Gumball tries hanging onto the floor, then grabs onto an open locker door, while holding Alan by his string.
Gumball says: "No!"
Gumball says: "Do something!"
Pieces of garbage fly past Gumball and Alan, splatting Masami in the face. Darwin is emptying contents of a garbage bag in Masami's direction.
Masami says: "Ew!"
Masami says: "Gross!"
Masami stops inhaling, releasing Gumball and Alan from her powerful wind. She shakes garbage off of herself.
Gumball says: "Thanks, guys."
Gumball says: "Whoa!"
The kids are blown away by Masami's strong wind, exhaling this time. They scream, and they end up in the cafeteria. Masami, once again in the center of her hurricane, approaches them, angrier than ever. She zaps a bolt of lightning at Alan, and he dodges.
Masami says: "Give him back to me!"
Masami says: "He loves me!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "No, I don't!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I'm sorry, Masami  but it's her that I love."
Masami says: "But why her?!"
Masami says: "!"
Masami says: "And not me?!"
Masami says: "!"
Gumball says: "Because you're psycho?"
Penny says: "Shh!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Masami, I—"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I just can't explain how my heart works."
Gumball says: "If it's anything like his digestive system, you probably don't want to know."
Penny says: "Shh!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I was saying..."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I can't explain how my heart works, but I know what it wants, and I learned today that I have to stand up for that."
Gumball says: "Isn't this the opposite of the lesson you're trying to teach—"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Masami, a broken heart is like a mirror."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "It's better to leave it broken than to hurt yourself trying to fix it."
Masami says: "Oh."
Masami says: "My."
Masami says: "Gosh."
Masami says: "You are such a wet cheese ball."
Carmen says: "I'd want seconds."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I love you, Carmen."
Carmen says: "I love you, Alan."
Several students have joined. It has stopped raining outside.
Students says: "Aww!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I'm so happy for them."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "But I kind of hate them again now."
Masami says: "Let's get out of here before I retch."
Students leave the couple, except for Gumball and Penny.
Gumball says: "Penny, promise me we'll never be like that."
Darwin then appears before the two of them.
Darwin says: "There's no risk of that 'cause you're not going out with each other."
Penny splashes a cup of milkshake into Darwin's face, much to Gumball's amusement.
Episode ends.
