At the Swimming Pool.
Coach  Russo says: "Okay."
Coach  Russo says: "So, Anton has had a heavy meal."
Coach  Russo says: "But oh no, he decided to go for a swim."
Coach  Russo says: "Fortunately, his friend Gumball respects the water."
Coach  Russo says: "He learned how to rescue his friend."
Anton says: "Hah!"
Coach  Russo says: "Okay, on my mark."
She tries to whistle, but repeatedly fails.
Gumball says: "Oh!"
Gumball who watches with anxiety as Anton loses air helps Coach whistle by shoving his own fingers into her mouth. then he pulls them out.
Gumball says: "Ugh!"
Gumball takes Anton by the arms, but pulls them off.
Gumball says: "What am I supposed to do?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Coach  Russo says: "First, you call out for help."
Gumball says: "Okay."
Gumball says: "Well, can I get some help here?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Coach  Russo says: "No."
He tries getting Anton with the skimmer. He succeeds, but all that's left of Anton is soggy bread. He splats this down on the ground. The other students scream in horror at Anton's remains.
Coach  Russo says: "Okay, gently tilt his head using your fingertips."
Gumball gathers up Anton's remains.
Darwin says: "What are you doing?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Darwin says: "That’s his butt!"
Gumball says: "Well, where’s his face?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Coach  Russo says: "Now breathe five times in his mouth, letting his chest fall between breaths."
Gumball does what Coach says. But since there is no mouth left, he repeatedly hits the soggy bread with his face, much to the horror of the other students.
Coach  Russo says: "Finally, lock your fingers."
Coach  Russo says: "Keep your arms straight, and do thirty compressions on his chest."
Gumball does what Coach says.
Gumball says: "It’s not working!"
Gumball says: "What shall I do?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Coach  Russo says: "First, you call out for help."
Gumball says: "Aah!"
He cries out in sorrow. The other students start crying for Anton. In the water, one of Anton's shoes floats.
Still Alive.
In the school bus the next day, Anton is shown reading a book. Gumball looks at him, incredulously.
Gumball says: "How is this possible?"
Gumball says: "Am I the only one around here amazed that he’s still alive?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "He must have a very good immune system."
Gumball says: "Dude, he was gone!"
Gumball says: "You know when you’re born, right?"
Gumball says: "Well, he did that, but in reverse."
Darwin says: "Ew!"
Darwin says: "Who would want to go back to the cabbage patch with all that dirt and slugs and stuff?"
Gumball says: "No dude."
Gumball says: "He came back to life, and I’m gonna find out how!"
At school, the bell rings. There's a montage of Anton dying over and over again, including having a heart attack, being eaten alive by Tobias, and exploding spontaneously. After being eaten alive by a flock of birds, Gumball and Darwin walk over to his crumbs.
Darwin says: "Maybe we should just ask him."
Gumball says: "Uh, maybe you should’ve said that before we iced him fifty times in a row."
Gumball says: "Let’s go to his house."
Gumball says: "I need to find out how this works."
One of the birds spits out Anton's shoe as they walk off.
Making Anton.
They hide behind a bush, and face Anton's house.
Gumball says: "Dude, something’s happening!"
Gumball says: "He’s there!"
Gumball says: "He’s fine again!"
Gumball says: "He’s wearing a mustache!"
Gumball says: "No, wait, he’s wearing lipstick!"
Gumball says: "Oh my gosh."
Gumball says: "There’s two of him, and they’re kissing!"
Gumball says: "Oh, it’s his parents."
Darwin says: "Let me see."
He takes Gumball's Eyes, and uses them as binoculars. Gumball grows new eyes. Anton's Parents twist the knobs until the first knob is diagonal, toast a slice of bread, and a new Anton pops out of the toaster.
Anton says: "Hi, mom!"
Anton says: "Hi, dad!"
Gumball and Darwin are amazed, and they are so shocked that their heads explode and their brains fly out.
Scene cuts back at their house. They are at the kitchen with a toaster.
Gumball says: "That completely blew my mind!"
Gumball says: "I mean, how does that even work?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "There has to be some kind of trick."
Gumball says: "We have to do exactly what they did!"
Darwin says: "Does that mean I have to wear a mustache and we should, you know..."
Darwin says: "kiss?"
Gumball says: "No."
Gumball says: "And for the record, I would be the one wearing the mustache."
Darwin says: "They did something with the dial before Anton came out."
Darwin says: "I think it was one left, one right, and then four and a half."
The toaster dings, and a burnt Anton pops out. He looks dead.
Gumball says: "I think this one is a bit burnt."
Darwin says: "He deserves a righteous farewell."
Gumball says: "Bye!"
Darwin says: "Bye!"
Gumball says: "I think we should try three, and a half."
They twist the dial, and toast another slice. Another Anton pops up.
Gumball says: "Yay!"
Darwin says: "Yay!"
Gumball says: "Maybe he’s still a bit underdone."
They toast him again. A perfect replica of Anton comes out.
Gumball says: "Yay!"
Darwin says: "Yay!"
Gumball says: "We made Anton!"
Darwin says: "We made Anton!"
Darwin says: "What shall we call him?"
Gumball says: "Hmm."
Gumball says: "Ant-Two?"
Ant-Two says: "Ant-Two!"
Gumball says: "Amazing!"
Gumball says: "We made a living, breathing clone of our friend!"
Darwin says: "Yeah!"
Darwin says: "After spying on him!"
Ant-Two says: "Spying on him!"
Darwin says: "And now there are two of him!"
Darwin says: "It throws out all sorts of moral issues way beyond our comprehension!"
Ant-Two says: "Moral issues!"
Darwin says: "Then why do I feel so bad about it?"
Gumball says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "It’s because we violated the laws of nature, as well as the laws of mankind, without any regard for our friend’s feelings!"
Darwin says: "Huh."
Darwin says: "Oh yeah."
Darwin says: "That’s why."
They hear the rest of their family arrive. They start unpacking the car.
Gumball says: "What have we done?!"
Darwin says: "What have we done?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "!"
Gumball says: "We’ve sunk pretty low before, but this has got to be the first time we’ve violated the laws of nature!"
Darwin says: "What do we do with him?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Gumball says: "You keep an eye on him and make sure he doesn’t go anywhere!"
Gumball says: "We’ve got to keep him out of the kitchen!"
Gumball says: "I’ll think of a clever distraction."
Ant-Two says: "Clever distraction!"
Ant II is gone. Gumball runs to the porch, and stands at the entrance.
Gumball says: "Mom, dad, wait!"
Nicole says: "What’s wrong?!"
Nicole says: "!"
Gumball says: "Uh, y-y-you left the oven on!"
Nicole says: "What?!"
Nicole says: "!"
She and the others run through the door, and to the kitchen. Gumball sighs.
Gumball says: "Wait!"
Nicole says: "What are you talking about?"
Nicole says: "The oven isn’t on."
Richard says: "There was food here!"
Richard says: "Eh, never mind."
Gumball and Darwin's Room.
Gumball enters his room, and sighs in relief.
Gumball says: "That was close."
Gumball says: "Why isn’t he repeating anymore?"
Gumball says: "What is wrong with you?"
Ant-Three says: "What’s wrong with you?"
Gumball says: "Hmm."
Gumball says: "I can’t tell if he’s repeating, or being sarcastic…  What are you hiding?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "Uh, nothing."
Gumball says: "Show me your hands."
Gumball says: "The other one."
Gumball says: "Come on, show me both hands!"
Gumball says: "YOU MADE AN ANT-THREE?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "I had to!"
Darwin says: "I turned around, and Ant-Two was gone!"
Darwin says: "And I knew you would be angry at me and you would do the angry mouth, and I would cry!"
Gumball says: "Okay, this is bad, but it could get way worse."
Gumball says: "I mean, what if he bumps into the real Anton?"
Darwin says: "Do you think we’re gonna get told off?"
Gumball says: "No, dude."
Gumball says: "We could get hunted down by the FBI, or tried for crimes against humanity."
Gumball says: "Or even worse!"
Darwin says: "Even worse?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Gumball says: "Yeah."
Gumball says: "Actually, I started a little too high."
Gumball says: "Being tried for crimes against humanity is about as bad as it gets."
Darwin says: "Ah."
Darwin says: "Good!"
Gumball says: "Dude, that’s still the worst it can get."
Darwin says: "Aw."
Gumball says: "Okay, we need to cover as much of the neighbor as we can."
Darwin says: "But we can’t ask for help."
Gumball says: "And we obviously can’t be everywhere at the same time."
They look at the toaster.
Clone Army.
The Park, nighttime. Gumball speaks to an army of Antons.
Gumball says: "All right, dudes!"
Gumball says: "This is our target!"
Gumball says: "If you see him, just pin him down!"
Gumball says: "Okay, ready, steady, go!"
The clones see each other, and start mauling each other. Darwin walks to him.
Gumball says: "What have you done with your Antons?"
Gumball says: "Did you lose them all again?"
Darwin says: "No."
Darwin says: "Well, there was a bit of an accident."
Darwin says: "I told them to split up to cover more ground."
Gumball says: "So?"
Darwin says: "I think they might’ve taken it too literally."
A shadowed image of what looks like the clones massacring each other shows up in Darwin's eyes.
Darwin says: "It was pastrycide!"
Gumball says: "Don’t beat yourself up."
Gumball says: "There guys are so sweet and obedient that if I told them, “go jump in a lake”,  they wouldn’t even think twice before they- oh, stop!"
Gumball says: "The mission is aborted!"
Gumball says: "We’re going back home!"
Antons says: "Aw!"
Gumball says: "We’re gonna need a place to hide them when we go to school tomorrow."
Antons says: "School tomorrow!"
School Tomorrow.
The bell rings. Anton walks happily across the school hallway.
Carmen says: "Hello!"
Anton says: "Hello!"
Teri says: "Oh, hi!"
Anton says: "Oh, hi!"
Clayton says: "Hey!"
Anton says: "Hey!"
Gumball says: "Gotcha!"
Gumball says: "You’re coming with me, Ant-Two!"
Anton says: "Ant who?"
Gumball says: "Aha!"
Gumball says: "I told you he was the clone!"
Anton says: "What clone?"
At the Watterson's house, Richard is fast asleep. Then he wakes up, troubled.
Richard says: "They’re trapped!"
Richard says: "They’re being held captive!"
Richard says: "They’re close!"
He sniffs a scent that leads him to the shed, and discovers the clone army.
Richard says: "Don’t worry."
Richard says: "You’re safe now… until it’s time to make a sandwich."
Ant-One says: "My name is Ant-One!"
Ant-One says: "I was the first!"
Ant-One says: "Kneel before me!"
The clones bow before him.
Back at school, Anton continues watching Gumball and Darwin.
Anton says: "Uh, actually."
Anton says: "You know what?"
Anton says: "I don’t think I care anymore."
Anton says: "See you later, guys!"
Ant-Two is seen at the hallway. Anton heads in his direction.
Gumball says: "Anton!"
Anton says: "What?"
Gumball says: "Uh, uh..."
Gumball says: "you’re late for class!"
Anton says: "Oh, no!"
Anton says: "Thanks, guys!"
He bumps into Ant-Two.
Anton says: "Huh?!"
Anton says: "!"
Anton says: "Since when do we have a mirror here?"
Ant-Two says: "A mirror here!"
Anton says: "Oh my gosh."
Anton says: "This mirror has an echo!"
Ant-Two says: "Echo!"
Anton says: "Ha ha."
Anton says: "I’ll see you guys later."
Gumball says: "Thank goodness he’s as dumb as the other ones."
Gumball says: "I thought we were busted and he’d find out about the cloning."
Anton says: "What cloning?"
Gumball says: "What the- how did you hear me?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Anton says: "Dude, just because I’m out of sight doesn’t mean I’m out of earshot."
Anton says: "You made a clone of me?"
Anton says: "How many did you make?!"
Anton says: "!"
Gumball says: "Pshhhh..."
Gumball says: "Not that many."
Anton says: "How many?!"
Anton says: "!"
Ant-Two says: "How many?!"
Ant-Two says: "!"
Anton says: "How many?!"
Anton says: "!"
Ant-Two says: "How many?!"
Ant-Two says: "!"
One of them gets sprayed through with a powerful blast of water. Ant I is seen holding the hose.
Ant-One says: "Enough to have my revenge!"
Ant-One says: "There can only be one original, and it’s me!"
Bread Battle.
Gumball says: "Quick, come with us, Anton!"
Gumball says: "We’ll protect you!"
Ant-One, and his army charge.
Darwin says: "What do we do?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Gumball says: "There’s only one way to fight an army of Antons!"
Gumball says: "We need a bigger army of Antons!"
Darwin says: "That’s a great idea!"
Gumball says: "Haven’t you learned anything today?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "That you mostly have bad ideas?"
Gumball says: "Uh, yes."
Gumball says: "But more importantly, it’s bad to play with life this way."
Gumball says: "Unless we get awesome scientific progress from it, I guess."
Gumball says: "And because of us, our friend is in danger!"
Darwin says: "Hmm!"
Gumball says: "Dude, what are you doing?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "Go and protect him!"
Darwin says: "I’ll buy you some time!"
Darwin says: "But tell Anton I’m sorry."
Darwin says: "I’m sorry for betraying his friendship, and I’m- hey!"
Gumball is revealed to have run off in the middle of Darwin's speech.
Gumball says: "Sorry, dude, you were speaking for too long!"
Darwin faces the Anton army.
Darwin says: "Well, I might go down, but I won’t go down alone!"
He starts fighting the army. Darwin hits, and kicked several clones. Then he stops, and realizes their ineffectiveness.
Darwin says: "Dude, you guys are totally useless in a fight."
Darwin says: "This doesn’t feel fair at all."
Darwin says: "I’m gonna have to stop."
Ant-One says: "No!"
Ant-One says: "You failed me!"
He pulls the fire alarm, setting off the sprinklers. The clones all scream as they become soggy, melt and die. Darwin watches in terror.
Anton clone says: "I’m melting!"
Cuts to Richard raising his head up against the sky.
Richard says: "No!"
Richard says: "I feel a great disturbance in the food chain as if a thousand sandwiches cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced."
Ant-One Gets Defeated.
Cut back to the hallway, as the sprinklers turn on just as Gumball and "Anton" enter the swimming pool area. Gumball fears for Anton's life.
Gumball says: "Aah!"
Gumball says: "Okay, I think we’ll be safe here."
Ant-One opens the door with a plastic sandwich bag over his body, which he removes.
Gumball says: "What’s your problem, man?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Why are you so mean?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Ant-One says: "Because once I get rid of him, I’ll become the only Anton!"
Ant-One says: "Maybe then you’ll be my friend, father!"
Gumball says: "Messed up!"
Ant-One says: "Come back, father!"
Ant-One says: "Everything will be perfect when it’s just you, me, and mother!"
Gumball says: "Dude, I’m not your dad!"
Gumball says: "I’m just a dude, and Darwin would make a terrible mother ‘cause he’s just a dude."
Gumball says: "And you’re not the one!"
Gumball says: "This dude is."
Gumball says: "Agh!"
Ant-One says: "Then if I can’t be the one, nobody can!"
Gumball says: "Agh!"
Ant-One says: "This is the end!"
Ant-One says: "We’re too heavy!"
Ant-One says: "You’ll have to let us go!"
Gumball says: "Dude, you’re two pieces of toast."
Gumball says: "I’ve lifted a sandwich before."
Ant-One falls off the high dive in slow-motion. The scene reverts to normal speed as Ant-One bounces off the low-dive and into the water.
Ant-One says: "You think you got rid of me?!"
Ant-One says: "!"
Ant-One says: "Well, I’ll be back, and you’ll forever fear my return!"
Ant-One says: "I’ll be your every waking thought, your every restless night!"
Ant-One says: "I am your worst nightmare!"
He crumbles to bits, and his remains are sucked down a drain.
Darwin says: "What’d he say?"
Gumball says: "I don’t know, something like-  Look man, I’m so sorry for what we’ve done."
Gumball says: "We played with life and didn’t think of the consequences."
Gumball says: "I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive us and we can still be friends."
Ant-Two says: "Still be friends!"
Gumball and Darwin seem incredibly shocked at the realization.
Episode ends.
