Bathroom.
The episode begins with Richard opening a mirror cabinet to get shaving cream. He closes it, and his reflection is shown. He yawns, then inhales deeply. He screams while putting the shaving cream on, then shaves his beard with a hatchet. He splashes hot water on himself, puts cucumber slices on his eyes, then applies a green face mask. He pulls out a nose hair and tears the face mask off. He admires his appearance, then roars.
Richard says: "You still got it."
Gumball and Darwin go up to the bathroom sink, grab a toothbrush, and start brushing their teeth.
Richard says: "Hey, kids."
Richard says: "Do I look old to you?"
They put their toothbrushes back.
Gumball says: "Uh, it's hard to say."
Gumball says: "I guess that's the good thing about being fat, it fills out all the wrinkles!"
Richard says: "Agh!"
Richard says: "Well, guess my age."
Gumball says: "Uh..."
Darwin says: "Uh..."
Darwin says: "Ooh!"
Darwin says: "Ice Age!"
Richard says: "What?!"
Richard says: "!"
Richard says: "Are you kidding me?"
Richard says: "When do you think I was born?"
Gumball says: "I don't know."
Gumball says: "Fifteen ninety-two?"
Richard says: "What?!"
Richard says: "!"
Gumball says: "Minus a hundred!"
Richard says: "Fourteen ninety-two?"
Richard says: "That's when America was discovered!"
Gumball says: "Aw, come on!"
Gumball says: "Help us out here."
Gumball says: "Was it B."
Gumball says: "C."
Gumball says: "or A."
Gumball says: "D."
Gumball says: "?"
Richard says: "Hmmph!"
Richard turns his back on the boys and leaves the bathroom in a huff. Nicole enters wearing a bathrobe, with a towel wrapped around her head.
Nicole says: "What did you say to your father?"
Gumball says: "It's not our fault!"
Gumball says: "It was a trap!"
Nicole says: "Ooh, was he fishing for compliments again?"
Gumball says: "Yeah."
Gumball says: "And some reality got caught in the net."
Darwin says: "But you know what it's like, Mrs."
Darwin says: "Mom."
Darwin says: "You're pretty old, too."
Nicole says: "I'm old?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, I mean, you're so old that..."
Gumball says: "You learned to drive on a horse!"
Gumball and Nicole laugh.
Darwin says: "You're so old that you ate dodo at your first Thanksgiving!"
Laughter from Gumball, Darwin, and Nicole.
Gumball says: "You're so old, that if you had kids now, they'd be born middle-aged!"
They all laugh.
Nicole says: "ALRIGHT!"
Nicole grabs the sides of her face, pulling the skin taut.
Nicole says: "No one stays young forever, you know."
Nicole says: "You'll see how it feels when it happens to you."
Nicole leaves the room. Gumball and Darwin snicker.
Darwin says: "Ahh, I think we'll be fine."
Gumball says: "Yeah, dude."
Gumball says: "I've been twelve for like..."
Gumball says: "Forever now!"
Darwin says: "I think we can safely say that we'll be young forever, and never  cha-a-a-a-ange!"
Darwin covers his mouth.
Gumball says: "ALRIGHT?"
Darwin says: "What's happening?"
Gumball says: "I think  OUR VOICES ARE BROKE!"
Darwin says: "Dude, that was so low you made some of my organs move inside."
Living Room.
Gumball and Darwin are sitting on the couch silently and they look at each other.
Gumball says: "Okay, that was weird, but I'm not gonna let it ruin our day."
Gumball says: "I'll call Penny and see if she wants to go to the mall."
Gumball gets off the couch, picks up the phone, dials the number and puts it up to his ear. It rings for a second and then the screen splits to Gumball and Patrick.
Patrick says: "Fitzgerald residence!"
Gumball says: "pleeeease..."
Patrick says: "Is this a joke?"
Gumball says: "Uh, no."
Patrick says: "This better be a joke."
Patrick's half of the screen gets bigger and bigger, crushing Gumball.
Patrick says: "I don't think you understand."
Patrick says: "You think you can call my house and freak us out?"
Patrick says: "You think you've got a scary voice?"
Patrick says: "This..."
Patrick says: "is a scary voice."
Patrick says: "Now listen to me."
Patrick says: "I have a very specific set of skills."
Patrick says: "Skills I've acquired over a very long career."
Patrick says: "In real estate."
Patrick says: "If you never call my daughter again, that..."
Patrick says: "will be the end of it."
Patrick says: "But if you do, I will look for you."
Patrick says: "IÂ will find you."
Patrick says: "And I will build a house around you."
Patrick says: "With no doors!"
Gumball says: "Okay, bye!"
Gumball puts the phone back, and now has a triangular shaped head due to getting crushed by the literal phone line. Darwin stares at the ceiling.
Gumball says: "What are you looking at?"
Darwin says: "I dunno."
Darwin says: "What are you pointing at?"
The Bus.
Scene then shows Gumball and Darwin, with Gumball's head back to normal, as they wait for the bus and get on. Darwin then speaks to the driver.
Darwin says: "Hello, two kids-price..."
The bus driver is revealed to be a stout dwarf warrior.
Manly Warrior says: "You disgust me!"
Gumball says: "Wait, what?"
Gumball says: "Why?"
Manly Warrior says: "Where is your pride?"
Manly Warrior says: "Where is your beard?"
Manly Warrior says: "WHERE IS YOUR AXE?!"
Manly Warrior says: "!"
Gumball says: "Wait, why are you driving with an axe?"
Manly Warrior says: "Oh, I use it to push the pedals."
Darwin says: "Sir, I think you're confused."
Manly Warrior says: "Your manly warrior voices gave you away!"
Manly Warrior says: "Our people built wonders in the mines of Ezrendel and here you are, pretending to be children to scrounge a bus fare!"
Manly Warrior says: "Shame on you!"
Gumball says: "Dude, we're not cheating anyone."
Gumball says: "We're kids."
Manly Warrior says: "I should report you to the Council of Elders!"
Gnome 1 says: "You don't need a discount!"
Gnome 1 says: "Your mountains are full of gold and mithril."
Gnome 2 says: "How can someone be so little and yet so evil?"
Gnomes throw food and rubbish at Gumball and Darwin while they step off the bus; bus Driver throws his axe at them.
Gumball says: "Do you feel like walking?"
Gumball says: "I feel like walking."
Gumball and Darwin walk as scene transitions.
Sidewalk.
Gumball says: "See?"
Gumball says: "It wasn't that far."
Camera zooms out to show that Gumball and Darwin's legs have been burnt off by walking.
Gumball says: "Oh, wow."
Gumball says: ""Buy one, get one free on two-sided tape."
Gumball says: "" That's like four-sided tape."
Darwin says: "No,  look!"
Darwin says: "Half price on double chip cookies!"
Darwin says: "That's like quadruple chocolate!"
Darwin runs off.
Gumball says: "Hey, wait!"
Store.
Darwin says: "Hmm, where are the cookies?"
Darwin says: "HEY!"
Larry says: ""Hey" yourself, young man."
Larry says: "I know I'm just a clerk here, but that is not a way to speak to people."
Larry says: "Oh, I see."
Larry says: "Now I'm getting attitude."
Larry says: "You know there's a policy here for disrespectful customers."
Darwin says: "It's not..."
Darwin says: "MY fault."
Larry says: "Oh-ho-ho."
Larry says: "So now it's my fault."
Larry says: "You refrigerate yourself, mister."
Larry says: "All right, that's it."
Larry says: "Security, we've got a code orange at aisle thirteen."
Darwin says: "No, please, it's not my fault."
Gumball approaches.
Gumball says: "Dude, what's going on?"
Darwin says: "I can't control the  And now Larry's angry at me."
Gumball says: "Ah, don't worry."
Gumball says: "I'll take care of this."
Security guard approaches.
Guard says: "Sir, I'm gonna need you to calm down."
Gumball says: "WE ARE CALM!"
Gumball covers his mouth.
Guard says: "Don't force me to use force!"
Guard says: "You need to take it down a notch!"
Gumball says: "I CAN'T!"
Guard says: "Fine!"
Guard says: "Then you asked for this!"
Guard says: "Actually, I'm not allowed to do anything but ask you to leave the premises peacefully."
Car Park.
Gumball kicks debris until he gets sprayed by a soda can. Darwin drops to his knees, crying.
Gumball says: "Maybe I'll just call Dad for a ride home."
Gumball runs off and comes back onto the scene.
Darwin says: "So?"
Gumball says: "He didn't understand a word I said and told me he doesn't speak fax machine."
Gumball says: "Well, that didn't work."
Patrick approaches in his car, with Penny in the backseat.
Penny says: "Gumball, where have you been?"
Penny says: "Why didn't you call me?"
Gumball says: "Penny, it's my voice."
Gumball says: "It's broke."
Penny's window rolls up.
Patrick says: "Watterson, are you giving my daughter some kind of weird silent treatment?"
Patrick says: "Because if you are, I have a very specific set of skills."
Gumball sighs, opens the door, rolls the windows up and closes the door.
Gumball says: "I think we need a doctor."
Darwin says: "What?"
Darwin says: "Oh, hold up."
Darwin punches himself.
Darwin says: "I think we need a doctor."
Gumball says: "That's what I said!"
The Doctor.
Gumball says: "And sometimes it's perfectly fine."
Gumball says: "But the next thing you know, it's  all over the place."
Doctor chuckles.
Darwin says: "Are you making fun of us because our voices are broke?"
Doctor continues to chuckle and a tear rolls down from his eye.
Doctor says: "Your voices are not broken, they're breaking."
Doctor says: "It means you're growing up."
Gumball and Darwin sigh.
Doctor says: "Did you really think you would stay kids forever?"
Darwin says: "Yeah, kinda."
Doctor chuckles again.
Gumball says: "Isn't there something you can do?"
Doctor says: "Hmm, no."
Doctor says: "Only a small percentage of the world doesn't age - mostly people on TV."
Gumball and Darwin sigh sadly.
Doctor says: "Oh come on."
Doctor says: "Growing up isn't that bad."
Doctor says: "Soon you'll be strong and handsome, like your dad."
Gumball and Darwin look at each other, their faces change to resemble Richard's and they gasp like him.
Darwin says: "Come on."
Darwin says: "What's the best thing to do when you know your childhood days are numbered?"
Gumball says: "Lie down on the ground and go like this?"
Gumball sits and starts to weep.
Darwin says: "No, dude."
Darwin says: "You make the most of it."

Darwin says: "I still look fly!"
