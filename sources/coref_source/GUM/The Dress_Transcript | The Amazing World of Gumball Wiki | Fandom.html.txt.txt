Anais says: "We're gonna be late for school!"
Gumball says: "Be there in a second!"
Gumball and Darwin are on the top of the house stairs, Gumball is naked and both of them are covered with ice cubes.
Gumball says: "Okay, by my calculations, these ice cubes will allow us to glide down stairs at almost the speed of light."
Gumball says: "Go!"
They "glide" down the stairs, both getting hurt.
Gumball says: "Awesome."
Both stand up and go to the door with Anais.
Gumball says: "Ready!"
Anais says: "You can't go to school like that!"
Anais says: "You're naked!"
Gumball says: "But I can't find my clothes."
In the Garden.
Scenes changes to the back garden. Richard is sleeping on the grass.
Gumball says: "Dad!"
Richard says: "Morning, son!"
Gumball says: "Why are you sleeping in the garden?"
Richard says: "Because I've been up all night doing the laundry."
Richard says: "Just like your mother asked me to."
Flashback to Nicole and Richard.
Nicole says: "Whatever you do, don't do the laundry."
Richard says: "Aye-aye, Cap'n!"
Back to the present.
Gumball says: "Great!"
Gumball says: "Can I have my clothes?"

Only Outfit Left.
Gumball is wearing a Daisy Flakes box; Richard is on a stool picking something from the top of a wardrobe.
Richard says: "Not to worry."
Richard says: "I’ve got just the thing."
Gumball calmly munches flakes from the box he is wearing. The stool turns over and Richard is forced to hang on the wardrobe.
Richard says: "Ah!"
Richard says: "Oh."
Richard says: "Here you go!"
Gumball says: "What?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Mom’s wedding dress?"
Gumball says: "I can’t wear that!"
Richard says: "But everything else is in the wash."
Gumball says: "I’d rather go naked!"
Richard says: "But if you do, your mother will know I’m a terrible father/husband!"
Richard says: "Please, son!"
Gumball says: "Okay, I’ll wear the dress."
Richard says: "Thanks, son!"
Gumball says: "I can’t believe this."
Richard says: "I can’t believe this wardrobe’s still standing!"
Richard says: "Aah!"
The wardrobe door opens and throws Richard out of the house window.

Gumball says: "I know, this is gonna be great!"
Darwin says: "No, um, what I really mean is..."
The car arrives to the top, it goes slowly.

At Home.
Anais is holding a photo of Darwin trying to kiss Gumball at the roller coaster.
Anais says: "So, now we see the real price of beauty."
Anais says: "You'll just have to tell him the truth, won't you, beautiful?"
Anais says: "And if he doesn't?"
Darwin says: "I want more kids!"
Gumball cries, both in his imagination and in reality.
Richard says: "Hmm?"

Gumball says: "Because the king of Europe has been kidnapped?"
Gumball says: "And they need my help 'cause I'm so beautiful."
Everyone buys it.
Anais says: "You better get on that bus before you blow the whole thing."
Anais says: "Now, have you got the balloon?"
Gumball says: "the darling of Elmore High."
Anais says: "Remember, this isn't about you."
Darwin says: "Hey, everybody!"
Anais says: "Here he comes!"
Anais says: "Quick!"
Anais says: "Get on the bus!"
Gumball rapidly gets on the bus.
Anais says: "This plan already reeks of failure."
Darwin comes to the rest of the class, whistling.
Gumball says: "Well, here goes."
The bus door opens and the balloon with Nicole's dress comes out.
Gumball says: "Hello, Darwin."
Darwin says: "You get more beautiful every time I see you."
Darwin says: "But why are you leaving?"
Gumball says: "I'm sorry, my love, but Europe needs me."
Darwin says: "Then take me with you!"
Darwin says: "A love this special only comes around once in a lifetime."
Darwin says: "We must nurture it, take care of it, let it grow and blossom, like a-a..."
Darwin says: "a..."
Idaho says: "-a potato?!"
Idaho says: "!"
Darwin says: "A potato!"
Gumball says: "You are a true poet, my love."
Gumball says: "And although we'll never see each other again, my heart and all my other internal organs will always belong to you."
Rocky says: "All aboard!"
Gumball says: "Uh, I have to go now."
Gumball says: "Bus is leaving."
Gumball says: "Bye."
Gumball opens one of the windows on the other side of the bus, then jumps out naked.
Gumball says: "Ow!"
The bus door closes, cutting off the string of the balloon with the dress from the bus, then Darwin and the others watch it fly up. Then the bus leaves.
Gumball says: "Uh-oh."
Darwin says: "She's an angel."
The balloon flies up towards the sun.
Penny says: "Look out for the sun!"
Everybody says: "The sun!"
Everyone tries to tell the balloon to evade the sun.
Everybody says: "Go left!"
Everybody says: "Go left!"
Everybody says: "Oh!"
Darwin says: "NO!"
Darwin says: "Why?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Darwin says: "WHY?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Anais says: "Gumball, go to him."
Gumball says: "But think of it this way."
Gumball says: "It's better to have loved, and watch that love be burnt before your very eyes, than to never have loved at all."
Gumball says: "So, why don't you and me head home, cover ourselves in ice cubes, and jump from the biggest top of stairs we can find?"
Gumball says: "What do you say, buddy?"
Darwin says: "Okay."
Gumball says: "Whoo-hoo!"
The dress falls on a fire hydrant.
Darwin says: "Your silence says a thousand words."
Gumball says: "Huh."
Gumball says: "I guess some people just can't help making fools of themselves."
Tina says: "Look."
Tina says: "There's Gumball."
Masami says: "And he's naked!"
Everyone laughs at him.
Gumball says: "Ugh!"
Gumball says: "Don't mock me!"
Darwin hugs the fire hydrant as Gumball walks past, Darwin's eyes are heart shaped again. Episode ends.
