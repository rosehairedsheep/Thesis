Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Oh, uh..."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Sorry, dudes, I totally forgot."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "I-I'll bring it in tomorrow, I swear!"
Gumball says: "Awww."
Darwin says: "Awww."
The next day. Gumball and Darwin angrily approach Tobias in the hallway.
Gumball says: "So, did you remember the game?"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Sorry, dudes."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "I'll totally bring it in tomorrow."
The location changes numerous times as Tobias makes more and more excuses for not bringing Gumball and Darwin's game back.
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Mm..."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "I am so sorry."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "I-I'll bring it in tomorrow, I pro- Oooh, I'm so- Mm."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Ah..."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "I- Mm, mm- Ah- Oh, oh, oh!"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Mm..."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Ah, ah- S-s-s-sorry!"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Ah- Tomor, tomor- Tom-mor-or-orrow!"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Mmm..."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "I-I-I-I..."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm..."
Gumball says: "Dude!"
Gumball says: "You've done this for so long, now, even your little "sorry" sounds are all the same!"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Oh, sorry."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "You thought tomorrow was today; I meant tomorrow tomorrow."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "I'll bring it in tomorrow, I swear!"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "See ya!"
Gumball says: "Okay, let's analyze the situation here."
Gumball says: "He's abusing our patience, retaining our property, and all civilized methods to deal with this problem have failed."
Gumball says: "I think we have ourselves a case for a war."
Gumball says: "Are you ready to follow me into battle?"
Darwin says: "Um, actually, you know what?"
Darwin says: "I thought maybe I could take the lead this time..."
Gumball says: "What?"
Darwin says: "Yeah."
Darwin says: "I'd like to have a try at being the leader."
Gumball says: "Why?"
Sad violin music starts to play as Darwin begins to sob.
Darwin says: "Uhh..."
Darwin says: "'Cause sometimes, I look at myself in the mirror, and all I see..."
Darwin says: "is nothing but a sidekick!"
Gumball says: "Hold on a second."
Gumball says: "Sorry."
Gumball says: "What were you saying?"
Darwin says: "Nevermind..."
The episode then cuts to Gumball and Darwin playing on computers in the library. Darwin clicks on something, and it makes him angry. The computer makes a "ding-ding!" sound as Darwin clicks.
Darwin says: "DAH!"
Gumball says: "What?"
Darwin says: "Look!"
Darwin says: "More proof I'm your sidekick!"
Gumball says: "Are you still going on about that?"
Gumball says: "Look, you get loads of emails!"
Gumball says: ""Hey Darwin," "hi Darwin," "hello Darwin."
Darwin says: "Yeah, but this is your inbox!"
Darwin says: "People didn't even think I've got my own email address!"
Darwin says: "You wanna see mine?"
Darwin shows Gumball his email inbox. It appears to be very old and damaged. A cockroach can even be seen crawling inside of it.
Gumball says: "Eww..."
Gumball says: "What the?"
Gumball says: "Is that cockroach inside your inbox?"
Darwin says: "See what I mean?"
Gumball says: "Some people send me your emails."
Gumball says: "It doesn't make you my sidekick."
Darwin says: "Oh yeah?"
Darwin says: "Then what about..."
Gumball says: "I'm sure mine's probably "Darwin's sidekick"..."
Darwin says: "Uh, no dude."
Darwin says: "It's "DARWIN'S BOSS!"
Gumball says: "Chill out!"
Gumball says: "It's just a yearbook!"
Gumball says: "No one actually thinks that!"
Darwin says: "Then, how do you..."
Darwin says: "explain this?"
Darwin says: "Hey you!"
Darwin says: "Look me in the eye and tell me you don't think I'm Gumball's sidekick!"
Gumball says: "Oh, that reminds me."
Gumball says: "Can I have my math book?"
Darwin says: "But, you see what I mean, though?"
Darwin says: "It's like I don't even exist without you."
Gumball says: "Darwin, you do exist, and I understand how you feel."
Gumball says: "So, we're gonna get that game back as equals!"
Gumball says: "Now, follow me and do everything I tell you!"
Darwin says: "Okay, great!"
Darwin says: "..."
Darwin says: "Aw, man!"
Trying To Sneak In.
Gumball and Darwin are at Tobias' house at night.
Gumball says: "Perfect!"
Gumball says: "Tobias left his window open!"
Gumball says: "We just have to sneak in, and get our game."
Gumball says: "Now, bend down."
Darwin acts as a pedestal for Gumball as he tries to climb in the window.
Darwin says: "See?"
Darwin says: "This is exactly what I'm talking about!"
Darwin says: "If I'm not your sidekick, then why are you always using me for stupid things like this?"
Darwin says: "If you owned a ladder, you wouldn't need me here at all!"
Gumball says: "Shhh!"
Gumball says: "At least a ladder would know how to shut up when it's helping me to sneak into someone's house!"
Darwin huffs angrily, and he walks into the opposite direction. The window closes in on Gumball's hands, and he falls into their basement.
Darwin says: "That's for demoting me from a sidekick to a foot-stool!"
Gumball says: "Okay, okay!"
Gumball says: "Point taken, now get me outta here!"
Darwin says: "I'm sorry, but I don't take orders anymore."
Gumball says: "Fine, you're not a sidekick!"
Gumball says: "You're an assistant!"
Gumball says: "I mean, a deputy!"
Gumball says: "Ugh, you're my vice Gumball!"
Gumball says: "Nah, I'm sure he's just gone to get some rope."
You Made Me Like This.
We then cut to the cafeteria. Rocky is serving students food, Gumball and Darwin included.
Rocky says: "Next!"
Gumball and Darwin are next in line.
Gumball says: "So..."
Gumball says: "last night, huh?"
Gumball says: "Things got a little..."
Gumball says: "Well, you were there."
Rocky says: "Next!"
Gumball says: "But, seriously, it's good we're all back to normal now."
Gumball says: "Same..."
Gumball says: "you know..."
Gumball says: "dynamic."
Gumball says: "Right?"
Rocky says: "Next!"
Darwin says: "I meant what I said."
Rocky says: "What are ya having?"
Before Darwin can speak, he is interrupted by Gumball.
Gumball says: "Can I get some tater tots and fish?"
Gumball says: "Oh, put the fish on the side."
Darwin suddenly becomes enraged. He throws his tray down on the ground, and storms off.
Gumball says: "I meant on top!"
Gumball says: "Put the fish on top!"
Darwin bursts through various doors through various hallways as Gumball tries to talk to him.
Gumball says: "Dude, why are you so angry with me?"
Darwin says: "Because it's your fault."
Darwin says: "You made me like this."
Gumball says: "What, a fish?"
Darwin says: "No, a sidekick."
Darwin says: "Is this some kind of..."
Darwin says: "..."
Darwin says: "joke to you?"
Gumball says: "Of course not, but do you ever think you brought this on yourself?"
Gumball and Darwin realize they just went into a circle. They are back in the lunchroom.
Darwin says: "This conversation is getting us nowhere."
Gumball says: "Yeah, you're right."
Gumball says: "So, let me demonstrate why people think you're a sidekick."
Gumball says: "See my point?"
Darwin says: "Huh, well, at least I'm not like this!"
Darwin says: ""Duh, hey Sussie!"
Darwin says: "While conveniently ignoring my own character flaws, I'm happy to point out that you eat with the grace of a one-toothed camel!"
Darwin says: ""Hey Rocky!"
Darwin says: "Let me help you with lasagna!"
Darwin says: "" "Zoom!"
Darwin says: "Zoom!"
Darwin says: "Zoom!"
Darwin says: ""  You see my point?"
Gumball says: "It would be hard not to."
Gumball says: "Okay, you're the boss now."
Gumball says: "You get that game back from Tobias."
Darwin says: "Finally!"
Darwin says: "I've been waiting for this for so long!"
Darwin says: "So, what should I do?"
Gumball says: "I don't know."
Gumball says: "I'd do something dumb and petty, like take something he likes, and not give that back."
Darwin says: "Hmmm..."
Momnapped!
We cut to the Watterson residence.
Gumball says: "You stole his mom?!"
Gumball says: "!"
We cut to Gumball and Darwin's bedroom. It seems that Darwin kidnapped Jackie Wilson, tied her up in a chair, put headphones on her head so she won't be able to hear, and gagged her.
Darwin says: "What?"
Darwin says: "You said to take something he likes!"
Gumball says: "Something, not someone!"
Gumball says: "Have you gone totally nuts?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "Uhh..."
Darwin says: "did I go too far?"
Gumball says: "Oh, I don't know."
Gumball says: "Why don't you ask our new house guest?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Do you think he's gone too far?"
Gumball says: "Oh, right."
Gumball says: "She can't answer, BECAUSE YOU TIED HER UP, YOU PSYCHO!"
Darwin says: "Look, it's not that bad."
Darwin says: "Tobias will know where she is as soon as he gets home and reads the note I left."
Gumball says: "Okay, you know what?"
Gumball says: "I'm out."
Darwin says: "Uh..."
Darwin says: "The thing is, I kinda signed the note from both us, with you being my sidekick and all..."
Gumball says: "Uh..."
Gumball says: "We're taking this poor mom back home before anyone notices she's missing."
Darwin says: "Hey!"
Darwin says: "I'm the one in charge!"
Darwin says: "We do what I say, and I say we do what you just said!"
We cut to outside. Gumball and Darwin are struggling wheeling Jackie back to her home.
Gumball says: "I can't believe this!"
Gumball says: "Do you realize that this is a living, breathing mom that you stole?"
Gumball says: "Poor thing!"
Gumball says: "Oh..."
Gumball says: "We should take the back-road so that we won't be seen by anyone."
Darwin says: "Wait."
Darwin says: "Since when does the sidekick give the orders?"
Gumball says: "Since the leader turned into a mom-napper!"
Darwin says: "Oh, so I make one little mistake during my first day on the job, and you decide I'm a criminal!"
Gumball says: "I didn't decide that!"
Gumball says: "Society did!"
Gumball says: "Now, I'm making an executive decision and taking charge!"
Darwin says: "You don't have the authority!"
Jackie slowly wheels down the sidewalk, and she speeds up gradually saying something but is muffled. Gumball and Darwin don't notice.
Gumball says: "That's it!"
Gumball says: "I am taking your leader badge away!"
Darwin says: "You never gave me a badge!"
Gumball says: "It's an invisible badge!"
Darwin draws an invisible sword.
Darwin says: "You better give that back!"
Gumball says: "What's that?"
Darwin says: "It's my invisible sword."
Darwin says: "Don't think I won't invisibly use it!"
Gumball says: "Well, try getting past my invisible bazooka!"
Jackie slides down the sidewalk, faster, and faster. She can be heard mumbling and screaming.
Darwin says: "Well, I'm coming for you in my invisible tank!"
Gumball says: "Invisible army, fire!"
Darwin says: "Don't make me use my invisible nuke!"
Gumball says: "No!"
Gumball says: "Fool!"
Gumball says: "You'll wipe us both out!"
Darwin says: "Okay, okay."
Darwin says: "Truce."
Darwin says: "Let's just work together."
Darwin says: "Wait a minute..."
Jackie is seen sliding down the sidewalk again, screaming profusely. There are tons of cars passing by on the road, and she's getting pretty close to it. Gumball and Darwin run to the rescue!
Darwin says: "Aw, man!"
Darwin says: "She's going to get creamed, and it's all my fault!"
Darwin says: "I never should have done this!"
Gumball says: "You're just realizing that now?"
A huge track is on the road. Jackie is approaching it. Gumball grabs a nearby rock, and he throws it on a switch underneath the chair, causing the chair to lower Jackie. She passes underneath the truck without a scratch, gets lifted in the air, and safely lands in a bush.
Gumball says: "Okay, that didn't work."
Gumball says: "Let's take the shortcut through Main Street!"
Darwin says: "But, there's hundreds of people!"
Darwin says: "We'd have to be invisible!"
Gumball says: "I've got an idea."
Gumball and Darwin draw a "face" on Jackie's blindfold and her duct-taped mouth. They pass through the street, acting as if they are beggars.
Gumball says: "People, please give generously to the cause of this poor woman!"
Gumball says: "Open your wallets as wide as your hearts!"
Gumball says: "It's for a good cause!"
Darwin says: "I feel so conflicted."
Darwin says: "I'm glad this is working, but I'm really disappointed in mankind right now."
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Hold on!"
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "I've got change for you!"
Gumball says: "Just ignore him and walk faster."
Gumball says: "Come on people!"
Gumball says: "Don't be greedy, give to the needy!"
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Stop!"
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Here, here!"
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "I've got money!"
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Wait, please!"
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Take it!"
Darwin says: "This man's giving out free money!"
Then, Mr. Small gets squashed by a frantic Gary, Martin, and Pantsbully.
Darwin says: "Well, that was easier than expected."
Darwin says: "Okay, so Tobias' house is just around the corner, right past that..."
Gumball and Darwin suddenly gasp.
Darwin says: "..."
Darwin says: "police car."
They then lower the chair again, and they try to get past the Doughnut Sheriff.
Donut Sheriff says: "Ah!"
Donut Sheriff says: "Thought you could hide right under my nose, did ya?"
Donut Sheriff says: "Surrender yourselves!"
Darwin says: "What do we do?"
Darwin says: "What do we do?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Gumball says: "There's no way out!"
Gumball says: "We're going to prison, buddy."
Donut Sheriff says: "Come out!"
Donut Sheriff says: "You're under arrest!"
Donut Sheriff says: "Come out, little peanut!"
Donut Sheriff says: "The long arm of the law is comin' for ya!"
Gumball and Darwin then continue their quest.
Donut Sheriff says: "You have the right to remain silent..."
Donut Sheriff says: "and delicious!"
Tobias' House.
Gumball says: "Ugh, this mom-napping thing was by far the worst leader move I've ever heard of!"
Darwin says: "Oh come on!"
Darwin says: "That's exactly the kind of idea you'd usually come up with!"
Gumball says: "Yeah, but if it was my plan, I would have had you stop me from doing it!"
Darwin says: "What do you mean?"
Gumball says: "I mean, you're not a sidekick, dude."
Gumball says: "You're a guardian!"
Gumball says: "I need you, man!"
Darwin says: "Can we go back to the way it was before?"
Gumball says: "Sure we can."
Gumball says: "Just as soon as we return the mother you stole."
Darwin says: "Yes!"
Darwin says: "The note's still here!"
Suddenly, the Wilsons' house door opens. It's Tobias! The boys think fast, and kick Jackie in a nearby bush before Tobias notices.
Tobias​​​​​ says: "Oh, hey, guys!"
Tobias​​​​​ says: "Did you come for the game?"
Tobias​​​​​ says: "Sorry, my mom cleaned my room."
Tobias​​​​​ says: "Only she knows where it is, and I can't find her anywhere!"
The boys then stare at Jackie struggling in the bush, then at a smiling Tobias, then they make their final decision.
Gumball says: "You know what?"
Gumball says: "Just keep it."
The episode ends.
