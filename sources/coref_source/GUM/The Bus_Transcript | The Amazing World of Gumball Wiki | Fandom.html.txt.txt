Skipping School.
Episode begins with the bus pulling up to the curb. Rocky opens the door.
Rocky says: "Hey guys!"
Rocky says: "Eh, why the long face?"
Rocky says: "Feelin' gloomy?"
Darwin says: "One, his face is long because he tried to stretch his skin to make it look like he's too old to go to school."
Darwin says: "Two, no, Mom didn't buy it."
Gumball says: "And three, yes, I'm feeling gloomy."
Gumball and Darwin get on the bus, and Gumball trips on his own face. The bus drives off.
Rocky says: "Oh, man, I don't know how you guys do it."
Gumball says: "Eh, it's not that difficult to learn how to stretch your face."
Gumball says: "There's an online tutorial for everything nowadays."
Gumball says: "So, did you finish..."
Rocky says: "No, I mean I don't know how you go to school every day."
Gumball says: "Rocky, you drive us there."
Rocky says: "Well..."
Rocky says: "I don't have to."
Gumball says: "Aah!"
Gumball says: "Aah..."
Rocky says: "Well, we're on a bus."
Rocky says: "We could go anywhere."
Darwin says: "Like under the sea, or to outer space, or up a rainbow?"
Rocky says: "Well, anywhere with a road."
Rocky says: "But not up steep hills..."
Rocky says: "or under low bridges."
Gumball says: "Let's do it!"
Gumball says: "After all, we've got the rest of our lives to go to school."
Alan​​​​​ says: "Well, I think we should go to school, so we can work hard and get the best possible start in li—"
Gumball walks over, pops Alan off-screen and sits back to his seat.
Gumball says: "Anyone else wanna go to school?"
Gumball's classmates says: "No, no, no no no..."
Rocky says: "Okay!"
Rocky says: "No school it is!"
The bus drives past school.
Rocky says: "So, where should we go instead?"
Teri says: "Daisyland!"
Tobias​​​​​ says: "The beach!"
Sussie says: "The school bus!"
Darwin says: "We're already on the school bus!"
Sussie says: "Ya-hah!"
Gumball says: "What about the water park?"
Gumball's classmates chatter in agreement.
Tobias​​​​​ says: "Aww, the beach!"
Rocky says: "Alrighty, we just gotta make one more stop..."
The bus stops and the door opens.
Richard says: "Almost."
Richard says: "Looks like Mr."
Richard says: "Yellow didn't make it."
Bus door closes and drives off. Banana Bob looks on from overpass, using binoculars.
Banana Bob​​​​​ says: "Why catch the bus when the bus can catch you?"
Bob jumps from overpass, but lands on road.
Banana Bob​​​​​ says: "Uh..."
Banana Bob​​​​​ says: "the binoculars made it look closer than it was."
Banana Bob​​​​​ says: "So I guess it's still quite fa—"
Bob is run over by the bus.
Banana Bob​​​​​ says: "Ugh..."
Children in Captivity.
On the bus, the students are still discussing the destination.
Gumball says: "Alright, we'll go to the water park, then the beach!"
Tobias opens his mouth to protest, but a foot stomps and startles the students.
Nigel Brown says: "irrelevant, 'cause you're going nowhere!"
Richard says: "Nobody moves, or I'll be forced to use this!"
All students but Gumball says: "It's a briefcase!"
Richard says: "No, more than that."
All students but Gumball says: "It's a ticking briefcase!"
Richard says: "No, more than that."
All students but Gumball says: "It's a bo—"
Richard says: "No no, no no no no no, less than that!"
Nigel Brown says: "Uh, yes, we are legally obliged to say it's not one of those."
All students but Gumball says: "Oh my gosh, they've got a b—"
Gumball says: "Oh, come on guys."
Gumball says: "It's obviously not a bo—"
Banana Joe says: "But it's ticking!"
Leslie​​​​​ says: "And masked strangers have taken over the bus!"
Gumball says: "But they're clearly our parents trying to teach us some sort of lesson!"
Gumball says: "Principal Brown hasn't even changed his name!"
Nigel Brown says: "Yes I have!"
Nigel Brown says: "I-I mean he has."
Nigel Brown says: "I-I mean he hasn't..."
Nigel Brown says: "I mean..."
Nigel Brown says: "who is this "Principal Brown"?"
Richard says: "You are!"
Nigel Brown says: "Shh!"
Nigel Brown says: "We are going to call the cops and tell them we won't release you until our demands are met!"
Nigel Brown says: "Make the call, Mr."
Nigel Brown says: "Rainbow."
Harold​​​​​ says: "I thought we were gonna disguise my voice!"
Nigel Brown says: "Um..."
Harold says: "​​​​​  there'll be consequences."
Harold says: "Oh, sorry..."
Dexter blows air into Harold's mouth again.
Harold says: "​​​​​  Or there'll be consequences."
Gumball says: "Oh, come on, Alan."
Gumball says: "You're telling me you don't even recognize the balloon?"
Alan​​​​​ says: "Wait..."
Alan​​​​​ says: "I do recognize him."
Gumball says: "Yeah?"
Alan​​​​​ says: "I saw him in our house last night!"
Gumball says: "Yeah?"
Alan​​​​​ says: "On TV."
Alan​​​​​ says: ""Elmore's Most Wanted"."
Gumball says: "It's just our parents trying to teach us a lesson."
Gumball says: "Like when my dad tried to teach us the dangers of texting while walking."
Flashback to Gumball and Darwin walking around a manhole and texting, with Richard inside.
Richard says: "Help me!"
Richard says: "I've fallen down this manhole because I was texting while walking!"
End flashback.
Gumball says: "Darwin, you can't seriously be scared of these guys!"
Darwin says: "Of course I am!"
Darwin says: "They're criminal masterminds!"
Richard says: "I just think it would be fun, I've never been in a hovercraft."
Dexter says: "No, we should ask for a private jet."
Dexter says: "They always ask for a private jet."
Richard says: "Could it be a private hovercraft?"
Phone vibrates.
Harold​​​​​ says: "We need to ask for money!"
Nigel Brown says: "How much?"
Dexter says: "It doesn't matter, the police know this is all fake!"
Gumball says: "See, they're not scary."
Darwin says: "Someone brave."
Darwin says: "Someone who's not afraid to look the enemy in the eye!"
Darwin says: "Someone who laughs in the face of danger!"
Darwin says: "I would say you, Gumball, but you're obviously sick."
Darwin says: "Hm..."
Gumball says: "No!"
Gumball says: "Me!"
Gumball says: "I'll do it!"
Richard says: "Oh, but hovercrafts are..."
Richard says: "Hm?"
Gumball says: "Uh, Dad?"
Richard says: "It's Mr."
Richard says: "Pink."
Gumball says: "Fine, Mr."
Gumball says: "Pink."
Gumball says: "I know it's you, Dad."
Richard says: "Uh..."
Richard says: "I've never heard of this 'dad' of whom you speak."
Richard says: "I'm just a criminal."
Richard says: "How did I become a criminal, you ask?"
Gumball says: "I didn't ask."
Richard says: "I suppose it all started when I was eleven years old and skipped a math class."
Gumball says: "Uh-huh."
Richard says: "And for this crime, the punishment was harsh and swift."
Richard says: "I spent twelve years in juvie, then five years inside, then twenty-four years on the run, then thirty years back in the big house, then a further seven in solitary."
Gumball says: "That makes you eighty-nine."
Gumball says: "It doesn't add up."
Richard says: "Well, I wouldn't know, 'cause I skipped that math class."
Gumball says: "..."
Gumball says: "sure."
Gumball says: "So, I assume you all ended up in a life of crime through skipping school?"
Nigel Brown says: "Uh-huh."
Dexter says: "Uh-huh."
Harold​​​​​ says: "Uh-huh."
Nigel Brown says: "Yeah."
Dexter says: "Yeah."
Harold​​​​​ says: "Yeah."
Nigel Brown says: "Mm-hm."
Dexter says: "Mm-hm."
Harold​​​​​ says: "Mm-hm."
Nigel Brown says: "Well, uh, my tragic story starts on the right side of the tracks, but boy, it sure doesn't stay there."
Gumball says: "Yeah, yeah, we get it."
Nigel Brown says: "But I learned the whole thing!"
Nigel Brown says: "Don't I get to..."
Nigel Brown says: "ohh..."
Gumball says: "See, I told you: it's a load of hooey."
Police Chase.
Siren sounds come from outside, and a fleet of police cars pursue the bus.
Police Officer says: "Aaaagh!"
The cars fly out of control because of the money blinding their view, and they crash into each other.
Donut Sheriff says: "That one's gonna hurt the taxpayer."
Donut Sheriff says: "Control, we need another million dollars."
Dispatcher says: "They doubled their demands?"
Donut Sheriff says: "Uh, uh..."
Donut Sheriff says: "yeah!"
Donut Sheriff says: "They doubled their demands!"
Donut Sheriff says: "Uh..."
Nigel Brown says: "Wow, they're really going big on this."
Dexter says: "If only they responded this fast to real crimes..."
Donut Sheriff says: "Where do you want the money?"
Nigel Brown says: "Leave the million dollops of unmasked bulls on the cold desert toad!"
Donut Sheriff says: "What?"
Donut Sheriff says: "..."
Donut Sheriff says: "What?"
Nigel Brown says: "Oh, sorry, auto-correct."
Nigel Brown says: "Leave the million dollars of unmarked bills on the old desert road!"
Donut Sheriff says: "All units fall back, ahead of second drop-off."
The Doughnut Sheriff's cruiser decelerates. At an old desert road, the bus approaches, seen through the point-of-view of some binoculars.
Hamburger Cop says: "Any sign of him, chief?"
Hamburger Cop says: "I'm cooking out here..."
The view goes to a visibly cooking Hamburger Cop with the briefcase.
Coffee Cop says: "They're on their way."
Coffee Cop says: "Make the drop."
Hamburger Cop leaves briefcase on the road and runs off.
Dexter says: "Okay, you hold onto me, and I'll reach out and grab the briefcase!"
Dexter goes out of bus door but gets caught in wind.
Dexter says: "Maybe we should switch!"
Dexter gets pulled back and Richard leans out and grabs the briefcase.
Harold​​​​​ says: "Did you get it?"
Richard says: "Uh-huh."
Harold​​​​​ says: "Okay, we have the money."
Harold​​​​​ says: "Now we don't want to see any red lights between here and the airport."
Lights on street all turn green, and Doughnut Sheriff notices.
Donut Sheriff says: "They're heading for the airport!"
Donut Sheriff says: "We've gotta take 'em down!"
Police cars crash into one another as they chase the speeding bus. The "hijackers" open the briefcase and discover real money.
Dexter says: "Wait, this wasn't supposed to be real money!"
Richard says: "It was just a trick to teach the kids a lesson!"
Gumball says: "Well, I guess the lesson you've actually taught is that crime does pay."
Gumball says: "Well done, chaps."
Gumball says: "You've done good."
Darwin says: "GET 'EM!"
All students but Gumball says: "AAAAGHH!"
The students charge and take over the adults.
Alan​​​​​ says: "We got 'em!"
They did a poor job, though Alan has tied up Richard and Tobias is holding Dexter by the cord.
Leslie​​​​​ says: "Kinda..."
Alan​​​​​ says: "And now to reveal their true identities!"
The students remove their masks. The person in the mask is "revealed" to be Richard.
Darwin says: "They were our parents all along?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Gumball says: "..."
Gumball says: "Really?"
Richard says: "You've got me, it's true."
Richard says: "I am Richard Wattersonnnnn's EVIL TWIN BROTHER!"
Gumball says: "Give it up, Dad!"
Richard says: "We just wanted to teach you that skipping school isn't cool or exciting."
Gumball says: "By involving us in a million-dollar high-speed police chase, which is probably the most cool or exciting thing we've ever done?"
Nigel Brown says: "Yes, but we thought it was all going to be pretend!"
Nigel Brown says: "Hang on..."
Nigel Brown says: "if the money's genuine, and the cops are for real..."
Nigel Brown says: "does that mean this is a real—"
Sussie says: "Bada-BOOM!"
Cut to another outside shot of the bus passing by a neighborhood as the students scream in terror. The briefcase drops to the floor.
Gumball says: "Whose insane idea was this?"
Phone vibrates.
Nigel Brown says: ""Stick to the pan, or everyone dines."
Work of the Wrecker.
Rob says: "Darn auto-correct..."
Everyone on the bus turns towards him.
Rob says: "Stupid thing never works."
Gumball says: "Rob?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Rob​​​​​​​ says: "It's Dr."
Rob​​​​​​​ says: "Wrecker to you, and yes, this whole thing was my idea!"
Rob​​​​​​​ says: "All I had to do was suggest the plan to Principal Brown, make sure the police thought it was real, and switch the briefcase for something a little more, shall we say..."
Rob​​​​​​​ says: "explosive."
Gumball says: "But why?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Rob​​​​​​​ says: "Because..."
Rob​​​​​​​ says: "I..."
Rob​​​​​​​ says: "am..."
Rob​​​​​​​ says: "your..."
Rob​​​​​​​ says: "NEMESIS!"
Rob​​​​​​​ says: "And also for the money..."
The bus drives quickly over a speed bump, throwing everyone into the air and jolting Rocky awake.
Rocky says: "Sorry, it's kind of hard to keep your eyes on the road when there's a crucial plot twist happening in the back of your bu..."
Rocky passes out on the wheel. With Rocky asleep, the bus begins driving wildly, causing the briefcase to slide over to Rob.
Gumball says: "The money!"
The bus continues to veer out of control as the adults try to wake up Rocky.
Donut Sheriff says: "Wow!"
Donut Sheriff says: "These guys are pros!"
Donut Sheriff says: "They must have one heck of a wheel-man!"
The adults continue trying to wake Rocky, while a helicopter attempts to lower the Hamburger Cop onto the top of the bus.
Hamburger Cop says: "Little lower!"
The cop ends up getting caught in a sign, and is flung off.
Airport Showdown.
The bus enters the airport, trailed by the police, and is about to hit a plane, when the plane director, after a moment's time to focus, skillfully directs all the vehicles towards different directions. He blows on, and twirls, his batons like a pistol and holsters them. The plane begins to taxi on the runway. The bus drives towards a different runway, this time with a plane that is about to land. Everyone on the bus, and the two Finger Pilots on the plane, scream, and the pilots quickly pull on the plane's rudder, sending it skywards and making it narrowly miss the bus. Rob and Gumball start to fight; the two initially tug for the briefcase Rob is holding, but Gumball, just as Rob is able to assume full control of his case, picks up the other briefcase, and starts to fight. Outside, the bus is now flanked by two pairs of three police vehicles, with Earl and the Hamburger Cop ready to get inside.
Donut Sheriff says: "Go go go!"
The two Hot Dog Cops break through the bus windows, though the Hamburger Cop gets stuck. Now inside, the cops apprehend the unmasked adults.
Earl says: "You are under arrest!"
Nigel Brown says: "It was him!"
Rob and Gumball continue fighting. Meanwhile, Rocky wakes up in time to see a plane headed in the bus's direction; he screams and ducks, and everyone screams and ducks as one of the plane's wings crash into the bus, tearing off the roof and taking Gumball and Rob with it. Everyone gets back up, noticing Gumball and Rob isn't there anymore.
Darwin says: "Gumball!"
Gumball and Rob continue fighting on the wing of the plane.
Gumball says: "Thanks, man!"
Gumball says: "Fighting on the wing of a plane is way more fun than math class!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "This isn't supposed to be fun!"
Gumball says: "Wait, what?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Th..."
Gumball says: "then why are you doing this?!"
Gumball says: "!"
As he speaks, Rob continues to swing his briefcase, which Gumball dodges.
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Because I'm a villain!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "What choice do I have?"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "All I've got on my résumé is laughing maniacally, monologuing about evil plans; got a major in Canadian History."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "I can't exactly go into catering!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "And now, Gumball Watterson..."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "PREPARE TO BE WRECKED!"
Rob stops as he notices the cops arriving and running towards them; he and Gumball turn their heads to look at them, Rob especially in a state of worry and Gumball in befuddlement. Beat.
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Oh, officer!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Help me!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "He's got a ticking briefcase!"
Donut Sheriff says: "You're coming with us!"
Seeing his arch-nemesis get cuffed, Rob takes the time to escape with the briefcase.
Gumball says: "No, no, wait!"
Nigel Brown says: "No no, not him, the other one!"
Gumball says: "It's too late now!"
Gumball says: "He's gone away with the money..."
Richard says: "No, he hasn't."
Richard says: "That's the money."
Richard says: "It's got my teeth marks in it."
Gumball opens the briefcase, revealing it does have the real money.
Donut Sheriff says: "Ah, we got the money back."
Donut Sheriff says: "He got away, but my shift ends in five minutes, so shall we say case closed?"
Gumball says: "But..."
Gumball says: "if this is the money, doesn't that mean that Dr."
Gumball says: "Wrecker has the—"
An explosion in the background sends Rob flying towards the  Doughnut Sheriff's car; Rob does have the ticking briefcase.
Donut Sheriff says: "Well there's only one thing left to say."
Donut Sheriff says: "You are..."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "I know, I know..."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "I'm wrecked."
Donut Sheriff says: "I was gonna say you're under arrest."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Oh, yes, that makes more sense..."
Rob slams his face into the car as the episode ends.
