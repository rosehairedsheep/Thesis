You Can't Take Away Our Son!
The episode starts out showing inside Principal Brown's office, as Richard is weeping by the desk.
Richard says: "How can you take Darwin away from us?!"
Richard says: "!"
Nigel Brown says: "Well it seems he scored a hundred percent in his aptitude test."
Nigel Brown says: "This has never happened before, so I had to tell the government."
Gumball says: "The government?"
Nigel Brown says: "Yes, they want to test him out."
Nigel Brown says: "Study his brain, probe it, dissect it."
Nigel Brown says: "That kind of thing."
The scene switches to Darwin with an equation on a chalk board.
Clipboard Man says: "Please resolve the following equation using the marker pen provided."
Darwin wipes marker ink all over his face.
The scene switches back to Elmore Jr. High School.
Nigel Brown says: "It's best they take him away."
Nigel Brown says: "He'd make the rest of you feel stupid."
Richard says: "I guess he's got a point."
Anais says: "So, you put clever people in quarantine like they're some sort of contagious pathological disease?"
Nigel Brown says: "Hmmm..."
Nigel Brown says: "maybe there's more than one genius in this family."
Nigel Brown says: "Apparently not."
Anais says: "Phew!"
Nicole says: "What makes you think I'll let you take away my son?!"
Nicole says: "!"
Nigel Brown says: "Well, technically, you're not his parents."
Nigel Brown says: "He's registered as a..."
Nigel Brown says: "pet fish."
Nicole says: "Richard, what are we going to do?"
Nigel Brown says: "Get a new pet fish?"
Richard says: "I'll save you, my little fish boy!"
Nigel Brown says: "Mr."
Nigel Brown says: "Watterson, that is a stationary closet."
Richard walks out of the closet and sits back down sadly.
Gumball says: "Can we visit him?"
Nigel Brown says: "Nooo."
Nicole says: "Are you saying we'll never see Darwin again?"
Nigel Brown says: "Yup."
Gumball says: "Then I'll go with him by proving I am a genius, too!"
Principal Brown, Nicole, Richard and Anais laugh mockingly at Gumball and he walks out of Principal Brown's office.
Gumball says: "I need to become intelligent right now!"
Gumball says: "Quick, Gumball!"
Gumball says: "To the liberray!"
Gumball says: "The libararara!"
Gumball says: "The..."
Gumball says: "libarium?"
Gumball says: "Eh, the place where the nerds hangs out."

Richard says: "I had so much more love to give."
Nicole says: "No one will ever be able to replace him."
Rocky says: "Hey dudes."
Darwin's photo descends, revealing Rocky.
Richard says: "Oh, hi Rocky."
Richard says: "What's with the suitcase?"
Rocky says: "Oh, I kinda got rent troubles and I don't wanna stay with parents."
Rocky says: "Hey."
Rocky says: "Can I crash at your place?"
Rocky says: "Please."

Colin says: "Trigonometry?"
Colin says: "Eh?"
Colin says: "Eh?"

The Internet.
Gumball pops up in front of a computer, with Bobert next to him.
Gumball says: "Hey Bobert."
Gumball says: "Whatcha' doing?"
Bobert says: "I'm on the internet, the largest source of knowledge in the world."
Bobert says: "Why don't you get connected?"
Gumball says: "Uh, hi, hello."
Gumball says: "Is this the Internet?"
Bobert says: "You need to click the icon."
Gumball says: "Which one is the icon?"
Bobert says: "Dude, it's the only thing on the screen."

Carmen says: "Shhhh."
Gumball says: "Hey."

Gumball says: "People are trying to work."
Carmen leaves the table with her book.
Gumball says: "Okay, brain, let's get reading."

Gumball's brain says: "I'm off to watch TV."
Gumball says: "Hey."
Gumball says: "Where do you think you're going?"
Gumball's brain says: "I didn't sign up for this."
Gumball's brain says: "I quit."
Gumball says: "You can't quit."
Gumball says: "There's no way I'm gonna pass a test without a brain."
Gumball says: "Please."
Gumball says: "I need you."
Gumball's brain says: "We'll never pass."

Training.
Scene cuts to the School Library. Gumball's Brain can be heard crying.
Gumball says: "Read it!"
Gumball's brain says: "I can't!"
Gumball says: "Read it!"
Gumball's brain says: "It's too difficult!"
Gumball's brain says: "Don't make me!"

Gumball's brain says: "Okay, I'm ready."
Gumball says: "Then prove it."
Gumball's Brain opens a book and performs a chop, but ends up hurting himself.
Gumball says: "This may take a while."
They perform a song while Gumball's Brain gets stronger.
Man says: "I was a feeble minded guy."
Man says: "I'd slip on ice and wonder why."
So many obstacles were thrown my way, on a downward slide each and every day.
But something popped inside my brain. I got up to fight that fight again.
And I knew what to do. I went through the mental pain.
You gotta think big, think deep.
Pretty soon you'll make that quantum leap.
Think big, think smart. Make your brain your finest body part!
The greatest minds from yesterday, will be crushed to dust 'cause I'm on my way.
Big, big, big You gotta think big!
Gumball and his Brain freeze frame while jumping. Idaho walks by, and wonders why they are doing that, but he shrugs it off.
What the—?
Scene cuts inside Principal Brown's office while he's enjoying his coffee, when suddenly Gumball surprises him.
Gumball says: "I want to take the aptitude test!"
Nigel Brown says: "Hmmph!"
Nigel Brown says: "You don't have the brain of the genius, Watterson."
Gumball says: "We'll see about that."
Gumball says: "Come on, brain!"
Gumball says: "Show Principal Brown what you can do."
Gumball's Brain grabs a desk light and swings it at Principal Brown, knocking him unconscious.
Gumball says: "What the—"
Gumball says: "?"
Gumball says: "What is wrong with you?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "I meant do an equation or something."
Gumball's brain says: "Oh."
Gumball's brain says: "Sorry."
Back in the Watterson's House.
Scene cuts inside Watterson's house with Rocky walking around.
Anais says: "I always pictured it a little smaller."
Gumball's brain says: "I've been working out."
Rocky sits with Anais and Gumball.
Rocky says: "Hey, dudes, want some popcorn?"
Rocky says: "Dad, can I borrow Mom's car tonight?"
Richard says: "Sure, son."
Richard says: "Anything you like."
Rocky says: "Man, my dad is a righteous dude."
Gumball notices Rocky's strange attire.
Gumball says: "Mom?"
Gumball says: "What's going on here?"
Nicole says: "Oh."
Nicole says: "Well, this is your new brother: Rockwin."
Rocky says: "'Sup?"
Gumball says: "You're kidding, right?"
Nicole says: "Come on."
Nicole says: "Let's just all give it a try."
Nicole says: "Just for a moment."
Brief pause.
Gumball says: "It's not working!"
Nicole says: "You're right."
Nicole says: "It's not."
Richard says: "No, it's not working."
Gumball says: "I miss Darwin so much."
Everyone starts sighing, except Anais. Then Anais interrupts.
Anais says: "All right!"
Anais says: "It was me!"
Gumball says: "What?"
Anais says: "It was me who filled out Darwin's aptitude test."
Anais says: "I found it on the TV guide."
Anais says: "I should be the one taken away."
Gumball says: "So Darwin's not a genius?"
Nicole says: "So Darwin's not a genius?"
Richard says: "So Darwin's not a genius?"
Gumball's brain says: "So Darwin's not a genius?"
Anais says: "No."
Anais says: "I am."
Suddenly the doorbell rings. They open the door and see Darwin.
Gumball says: "Darwin!"
Richard says: "Darwin!"
Nicole says: "Darwin!"
Anais says: "Darwin!"
Darwin says: "Hello!"
Clipboard Men says: "We believe this, is yours."
Darwin steps inside the house.
Anais says: "Yay!"
Gumball says: "Welcome back, buddy!"
Nicole says: "I missed you so much."
Anais says: "Don't ever go away again."
Richard says: "What a conveniently happy ending."
Happy Ending?
The door starts to close, but a Clipboard Man prevents the door from closing with his leg.
Clipboard Man says: "Not so fast."
Everyone gasps.
Richard says: "Hey."
Richard says: "I said it was a happy ending."
Clipboard Man says: "You still owe us one genius."
Gumball says: "What do you mean?"
Clipboard Man says: "Well, it's obvious he didn't take that test."
Darwin gives a stupid look.
Clipboard Man says: "But someone in this house did,  and this warrant says that we get to take that person away."
Everyone gasps again.
Clipboard Man says: "Who is it?"
They begin to get anxious.
Gumball's brain says: "Ahem."
Gumball's brain says: "I know who it is."
Gumball says: "Be quiet."
Gumball says: "Don't listen to him."
Gumball says: "He's insane in the membrane."
Gumball's brain says: "Don't worry."
Gumball's brain says: "I know what I'm doing."
Gumball says: "No, you don't."
Gumball says: "You're stupid."
Gumball says: "We've established that."
Clipboard Man says: "Let the brain speak."
A heartbeat sound can be heard as each person's worried face is shown. Then cuts to Rocky drinking soda and creating the heartbeat-like sound.
Rocky says: "Sorry."
Gumball's brain says: "The person who took the test was..."
Gumball's brain says: "H-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h—"
Gumball's brain says: "him!"
Rocky says: "Huh?"
Everyone surprised.
Rocky says: "Me?"
Rocky says: "Oh."
Rocky says: "Yeah, I took that test."
Clipboard Man says: "Then get your suitcase."
Clipboard Man says: "You're coming to the research center."
Rocky says: "What, you mean like, for free?"
Clipboard Man says: "Well of course."
Rocky says: "Eh, definitely beats my parents' place."
Scene cuts inside the car with Rocky in it.
Rocky says: "Oh, and I'm gonna need a hot tub, too."
Rocky says: "'Cause I do most of my thinking in the bath."
The car leaves.
Gumball says: "See ya, Rocky."
Nicole says: "Bye, Rocky."
Richard says: "Bye."
Gumball says: "That was really smart, Brain."
Gumball says: "Darwin's back home."
Gumball's brain says: "Can I come home too?"
Gumball says: "Are you kidding me?"
Gumball says: "Get in there, little dude."
Gumball's brain says: "Whoo-hoo."
Gumball says: "High five."
Gumball's brain says: "Ha."
Scene changes inside the research facility with Rocky in it.
