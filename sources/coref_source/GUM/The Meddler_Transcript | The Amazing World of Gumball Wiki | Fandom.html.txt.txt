Richard says: "Hey honey, how was work?"
Richard says: "Is dinner ready yet?"
Gumball enters the house.
Gumball says: "Hey, Mom, Dad, guess what?"
Gumball says: "I got a B plus in home-ec today!"
Gumball says: "Miss Simian said my souffl√© was divine."
Richard says: "Yeah, yeah, that's very interesting."
Richard says: "Yeah, yeah."
Richard says: "I'm very proud of you son."
Gumball says: "I also crashed your car on the run from the police after I robbed a bank."
Richard says: "Uh huh, good for you."
Gumball whistles as he walks, falls over and pretends to injure his leg.
Gumball says: "Ah!"
Gumball says: "My leg!"
Gumball says: "It's broken!"
Gumball says: "I probably need to get it cut off!"
Gumball says: "Ahaaa!"
Gumball says: "And yet nobody cares."
Gumball says: "WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET NOTICED IN THIS HOUSE?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Nicole says: "What?"
Nicole says: "Richard, I think Gumball needs some attention."
Richard says: "Yeah, yeah."
Richard says: "We're all very proud of you, Nicole."
Nicole sighs and walks up the stairs; scene changes to Gumball's bedroom, Nicole appears behind the door, enters the room and sits next to the upset Gumball who proceeds to move away until he falls off the bed.
Gumball says: "What?"
Nicole says: "Listen honey, I'm sorry you've not been getting enough attention lately."
Nicole says: "I'm going to make it up to you starting tomorrow."

Darwin says: "it's not as good as it sounds."
Penny says: "Sorry, Gumball."
Penny says: "It's the cheerleader tryouts tonight, I've been practicing all year for this."
Penny says: "Another time though."
Gumball says: "Okay, no problem."
Gumball says: "I love you Penny."
Penny says: "What!"
Penny says: "?"
Gumball says: "Wha, oh nothing."
Gumball says: "I just said I love peanuts."
Gumball says: "Yeah, peanuts..."
Gumball says: "th-they taste so good."
Penny says: "Gumball, I am a peanut."
Penny says: "That's like me saying I like to eat cats."
Penny says: "Maybe you should think twice about the things you say."
Gumball says: "But, I did think twice."
Penny says: "Well maybe you need to think three times."
Penny says: "Anyway, see you later."
Gumball says: "Oh, whatever."
Darwin says: "Maybe you need to talk with your mouth shut."
The locker suddenly opens, revealing Nicole scrunched inside.
Nicole says: "Is that really the way you talk to girls?"
Gumball says: "Mom, what are you doing here?"
Nicole says: "Well you said you wanted more attention, so I followed you to school."
Nicole says: "But by the looks of it you need more than attention; you need serious help, little man."
Nicole's Time at Elmore Junior High.
Nicole, Gumball and Darwin are walking along the hall, Darwin has a huge grin on his face.
Gumball says: "Aw Mom, if you're seriously going to follow us around all day, do you really need to hold my hand?"
Nicole says: "Yes."
Darwin says: "Yay!"
Darwin says: "Mom's at school!"
Nicole says: "And it's not all day, it's all week."
Nicole says: "I took the night shift."
Gumball groans; Tina, Jamie, Banana Joe and Anton are laughing at Gumball.
Tina says: "Hey, Mom, need a diaper for that baby?"
They continue to laugh.
Gumball says: "Ooh, actually I am fully potty trained, so check your facts all right?"
Tina laughs.
Tina says: "You know you got 'em good when their voices go high."
Nicole says: "Gumball!"
Nicole says: "Are you really going to take that?"
Darwin says: "She just owned you."
Gumball says: "What?"
Gumball says: "You got a better idea?"
Nicole says: "Well, first of all, drop an octave, then give her a taste of her own medicine."
Nicole says: "Try this."
Gumball says: "Uh, Tina?"
Gumball says: "I'd just like to say that maybe you only bully people because you're insecure about your walnut-sized brain and the fact that you smell like a sweaty butcher."
Banana Joe says: "Glandular."
The kids laugh.
Gumball says: "Wow, it actually worked!"
Jamie says: "Yeah, that was funny!"
Jamie says: "But good luck when Tina comes back and your mom's not around to hold your hand."
Nicole says: "Don't worry, Gummypuss!"
Nicole says: "I'll hold your hand until college, if I have to!"
Banana Joe says: "Gummypuss!"

Nicole says: "You need to be firmer than that!"
Gumball says: "Huh?"
Nigel Brown says: "Oh okay."

Penny says: "Sure, but you guys will need to be quick."
Penny says: "The cheerleader tryouts are about to start."

Nicole says: "Didn't we Darwin?"
Darwin says: "To be honest, I've never been so embarrassed in my entire life!"
Nicole says: "Why are you smiling then?"
Darwin says: "Well at first I was trying not to hurt your feelings, but now I'm just stuck!"
Gumball says: "I beg of you, just get out of my life."
Nicole says: "Okay, I guess I'll just go home then."

Gumball says: "No!"
Gumball says: "I'm gonna beat Penny at her own game so she'll realize how awesome and manly I am!"
Gumball says: "Then she'll definitely wanna date me!"
Nicole says: "Right."
Nicole says: "So, what's the problem?"
Gumball says: "The problem is me!"
Gumball says: "What if I'm not good as the other girls?"
