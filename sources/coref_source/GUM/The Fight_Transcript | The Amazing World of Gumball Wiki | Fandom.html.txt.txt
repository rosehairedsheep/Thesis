You're Being Bullied.
Gumball, Darwin, Anais, and Richard are sitting on the couch watching a thumbwrestling game on TV. Anais turns around and notices Gumball with lasagna all over his face.
Anais says: "Huh?"
Anais says: "Are you okay?"
Gumball says: "Yep!"
Gumball says: "School was awesome!"
Flashback shows Tina holding Gumball upside down, shaking out his spare change.
Gumball says: "I was hanging out with Tina!"
Gumball says: "She taught me how to donate to charity."
Gumball says: "Who is this for, again?"
Tina says: "Me!"
Gumball says: "Then, she helped me "tear" through my homework."
Flashback shows Tina tearing Gumball's homework, and an "F" pops up on it.
Gumball says: "And finally, we had lunch together!"
Gumball says: "Hmmm, what should I try first?"
Tina pushes Gumball's face into the lasagna.
Gumball says: "Mmmm!"
Gumball says: "Lasagna!"
Flashback ends.
Gumball says: "It was great!"
Anais stares disapprovingly at Gumball.
Gumball says: "What?"
Anais says: "I think you're being bullied."
Gumball says: "Nah, we're just having fun."
Anais says: "Hmmm..."
Anais says: "Nope, you're definitely getting bullied."
Gumball says: "Ah!"
Gumball says: "What am I gonna do?"
Anais says: "Don't worry, bro, I'll take care of this for you."
Anais says: "Hey, Tina, you've been picking on my brother, and I think it's time you guys talk about this face to face!"
Tina roaring can be heard over the phone.
Anais says: "Tomorrow?"
Anais says: "Four P."
Anais says: "M."
Anais says: "?!"
Anais says: "!"
Anais says: "Behind the school?!"
Anais says: "!"
Anais says: "No, wait, that's not what I meant!"
Anais says: "Oopsies!"
Gumball says: "Well?"
Anais says: "It looks like your face to face turned into more of a..."
Anais says: "face to fist..."
Gumball says: "What the..."
Gumball says: "what?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Anais says: "I think she wants to have a fight with you..."
Wrestling bell rings.
Richard says: "Come on, son, it's time I showed you how to deal with bullies."
The Bunny Hop.
Gumball and Richard are at the backyard.
Richard says: "There's a day in every man's life where he has to stand up for himself!"
Richard says: "But that's okay, 'cause daddy's here to teach you an old technique that got me out of trouble many times."
Gumball says: "Ooooh, a secret fighting technique?"
Richard says: "Yes, it's called..."
Richard says: "The Bunny Hop!"
Richard says: "But remember, you must never use it in anger!"
Gumball says: "I promise, father."
Richard says: "Alright, you be the bully."
Gumball says: "Okay."
Richard says: "Come on, don't be shy, go on and take my lunch money!"
Gumball makes a tiny step and meows, Richard freaks out.
Richard says: "DON'T HURT ME, DON'T HURT MY FACE, HERE'S MY LUNCH MONEY, AND MY LUNCH, PLEASE TAKE IT, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!"
Richard says: "That was step one, and here comes the Bunny Hop!"
Richard freaks out again, jumps around, and hits the fence; Darwin and Anais came to see what happened.
Gumball says: "Well, that wasn't much help."
Anais says: "You're right, I think you need help from a real adult."
Mr. Small's Office.
Mister Small​​​ says: "School counselor, pretty scary title, huh?"
Mister Small​​​ says: "But don't you worry, think of me as a friend, a compadre, a fellow pilgrim, on a mad journey we call..."
Mister Small​​​ says: "life!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "So tell me, what's shaking?"
Gumball says: "Oh, I'm fine!"
Anais says: "No, he's not!"
Anais says: "He's being bullied!"
Mister Small​​​ says: "Oh, the big "B..."
Mister Small​​​ says: "" You know, more often than not, conversation beats confrontation."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Hands down, let's meditate on this."
Gumball says: "Ommmmm..."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Ommmmm..."
Gumball says: "Ommmmmm..."
Mister Small​​​ says: "Ommmmmm..."
Mister Small​​​ says: "So tell me, who's bullying you?"
Gumball says: "Tina Rex."
Anais says: "Tina Rex."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "TINA REX?!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "!"
All of Mr. Small's colors drip of his body, and he throws Gumball and Anais out of his office.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Don't tell her you saw me!"
Viva la Revolution.
Anais says: "Well, that wasn't much help."

Tobias​​​​​​​​​ says: "This will be the greatest fight eveeer!"
Gumball says: "This is getting out of hand."
Anais says: "Don't worry, I'll fix this."
Anais says: "Come on, what is wrong with you, guys?"
Anais says: "How many of you've being bullied by Tina?"
Gumball's schoolmates mumble confused and raise their hands.
Anais says: "Don't you realize we could all join forces and we can stand up to Tina once and for all?"
Gumball's classmates mumble again, cheery music starts playing in the background.
Anais says: "And no student will ever be bullied again!"
Everybody says: "Yeah!"
Anais says: "And also stop global warming!"
Everybody says: "Yeah!"
Anais says: "And bring peace to the world!"
Everybody says: "Yeah!"
Anais says: "And build schools for the dolphins and the rain forests so they can cure baldness!"
Everybody says: "Yeah!"
Gumball says: "Uh, Anais?"

Anais says: "See you on Capitol Hill!"
Darwin says: "There you are!"
Darwin says: "Shhh!"
Darwin says: "Just follow me!"
Protecting Armor.
Gumball and Darwin are in the gym. Darwin then turns the lights on, revealing an armor made of cardboard and metal.
Darwin says: "Behold, the Super Bully Protecting Suit of  Power!"
Gumball says: "WHOAAAAH!"
Gumball says: "I LOVE IT!"
Darwin says: "Lookin' good."
Darwin says: "Now check this out!"
Darwin says: "It's got bouncing bubble wrap pants and has an MP3 player as standard!"
Darwin turns the MP3 player on, and they starts dancing.
Darwin says: "And that's not all: this string here operates the Super Counter Attack Device."
Gumball tries to use it.
Darwin says: "No, wait!"
Darwin says: "You only got one shot, so you must wait for the right moment."
Gumball says: "Okay."
Darwin says: "And last, but not least: the tassels!"
Gumball says: "What do these do?"
Darwin says: "Move your arm around."
Gumball does so.
Gumball says: "Oooooh, tassels!"
Darwin says: "Oooooh, tassels!"
Darwin says: "Okay, time to put it to the test!"
Darwin says: "Ready?"
Gumball says: "Okay!"
Darwin repeatedly hits Gumball with a hockey stick as Gumball screams in pain.
Darwin says: "Can you feel anything yet?"
Gumball screams in pain.
Darwin says: "Okay, I'll keep going!"
Gumball tries to stop Darwin, who finally stops. Gumball pulls the "Super Counter Attack Device," it's confetti.
Darwin says: "What did it feel like?"
Gumball says: "Like I'm being hit with a stick!"
Darwin says: "What?"
Gumball takes off the helmet of the suit, he has swolen eyes, bumps on his head and missing teeth.
Gumball says: "Like I'm being hit with a stick!"
Gumball says: "That wasn't much help..."
Darwin says: "That's okay!"
Darwin says: "We could rebuild it, better, faster, stronger!"
Darwin says: "Let's get to work!"
Ring bell sounds.
Darwin says: "Oh!"
Darwin says: "Too late."
Gumball says: "You know what?"
Gumball says: "Maybe it won't be so bad."
Gumball says: "I'll just meet Tina in quite calmed atmosphere and talk things like civilized people."
Gumball says: "Yeah!"
Darwin says: "Yeah!"
Gumball says: "This is a great idea!"
The Confrontation.
Gumball and Darwin are at the schoolyard in the middle of a crowd that are cheering Gumball by chanting "Fight".
Gumball says: "This, is a terrible idea."
The crowd keeps chanting "Fight", until Miss Simian interrupts.
Lucy Simian says: "What's going on here?"
Everyone stops and looks at her.
Lucy Simian says: "I'll have no fighting on my watch."
Lucy Simian says: "Oh, Gumball Watterson."
Lucy Simian says: "I might have known!"
Gumball says: "Ahh, thank you Miss Simian!"
Gumball says: "Uhh, I was gonna fight a T-Rex."
Gumball says: "Please, send me to detention!"
Lucy Simian says: "Well, I suppose I could..."
Lucy Simian says: "after my coffee break!"
Gumball says: "But Miss Simian!"
Gumball says: "Tina's gonna—"
Lucy Simian says: "Emmm!"
Lucy Simian says: "Coffee."
Lucy Simian says: "Break?"
Gumball says: "But Miss Simian, you're my last hope!"
Gumball says: "Please!"
Gumball's classmates resume to chanting "Fight." Tina then stomps onto the schoolyard from behind a corner.
