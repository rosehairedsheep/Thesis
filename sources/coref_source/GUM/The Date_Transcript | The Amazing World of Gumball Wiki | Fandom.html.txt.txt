Gumball's Good News.
At their house, the Wattersons are sitting down for dinner, Richard looks beat up and is telling a story as everyone is looking at him.
Richard says: "And that's why you should never mix Pop Rocks and soda!"
Nicole says: "Okay..."
Nicole says: "Anyone else have a riveting tale?"
Richard says: "I do!"
Nicole says: "Richard, let's hear from the children."
Gumball says: "Well, Penny asked me out on a date."
Gumball says: "No biggie."
Nicole says: "She did?!"
Nicole says: "!"
Nicole says: "That's great news!"
Nicole says: "What did she say?"
Gumball says: "Well..."
Flashback to earlier in the day, in the school hallway.
Gumball says: "Excuse me, what?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Penny says: "Do you want to come around to my house this Saturday?"
Gumball says: "Me, with you, at your place?"
Penny says: "You see, it's..."
Gumball ignores the rest of what she says as he daydreams about her before cutting back to the present.
Gumball says: "Yeah, that's about it."
Nicole says: "Oh, my little boy is becoming a man!"
Nicole tries to hug Gumball, but he blocks her arms karate style. Eventually, Nicole gains the upper hand and ends up hugging Gumball.
Gumball says: "Mom!"
Darwin says: "Man, you're my hero."
Darwin says: "You're going on this big date and you're not even nervous!"
Darwin says: "I'd be freaking out!"
Darwin says: "I mean think about it, if you blow it, she'll never speak to you again, and you'll be left alone for the rest of your life, and never find happiness!"
Gumball slightly panics.
Nicole says: "Don't worry sweetie, just be yourself!"
Nicole says: "That's all a girl wants."
Gumball says: "Thanks, Mom."
Nicole says: "See you after work!"
Gumball says: "Bye!"
Darwin says: "Bye!"
Anais says: "Bye!"
Richard laughs.
Gumball says: "What?"
Richard says: "Listen son, ignore everything your mother just said."
Gumball says: "Why?"
Richard says: "Look, women only think they want us to be ourselves because they don't know how wretched we actually are."
Richard says: "What you have to do is think of someone really cool and attractive and be them!"
Gumball says: "R-Really?"
Gumball says: "B-But, Anais is this true?"
Anais says: "I'm gonna have to go with Dad on this one."
Anais says: "You're kind of a loser, Gumball."
Richard says: "Exactly."
Anais says: "Sorry."
Gumball says: "What am I gonna do?"
Gumball says: "I really like Penny."
Gumball says: "I want her to like me too."
Darwin says: "You could start by being romantic, dress up a little,  find her some presents."
Gumball says: "Well, I can't do any of those things."
Gumball says: "I don't have any money."
Richard says: "Listen son, you don't need money to show a girl a good time."
Richard says: "You think I have money?"
Gumball says: "Err..."
Gumball says: "No."
Richard says: "Do you see Mom leaving me?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, everyday she goes to work and earn money."
Richard says: "There's other ways to get stuff without spending money."
Richard comes closer to Gumball.
Richard says: "Do you want to hear the secrets kept in centuries by Watterson men?"
Gumball says: "I..."
Gumball says: "don't have any choice, do I?"
Richard says: "No!"
Richard says: "Come with me."
Gumball follows.
Shopping.
Richard walks outside the house with Gumball.
Richard says: "First things first, we need to get you some nice clothes."
Gumball says: "Yeah, Penny loves fashion!"
Gumball says: "That's a great idea!"
Richard and Gumball arrive at a dump.
Richard says: "Here we are."
Richard says: "The greatest department store in the world, where everything is  free!"
Camera zooms out, revealing a large dump with a mountain of garbage.
Richard says: "So anything new?"
Richard says: "Woo, that's nice."
Gumball says: "What the- You're going to get my date's clothes out of the dump?"
Gumball says: "Oh, man that's gross."
Richard says: "I didn't hear you complaining when I gave you that sweater."
Gumball says: "What?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "My favorite sweater came out of the dump?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Richard says: "No!"
Richard says: "Don't be silly."
Richard says: "I found it in a sewer outlet."
Gumball says: "Oh, man..."
Gumball says: "I wear this all the time..."
After Shopping.
Richard says: "You are gonna look smashing!"
Gumball says: "You think so?"
Richard says: "Right!"
Richard says: "You've got the look, but you're gonna need a bit of money in your pocket so you can treat her on the date."
Richard says: "And I'm going to show you a great way of getting money for free!"
Gumball says: "Awesome."
Getting Ready.
Back to the Gumball' bedroom, with romantic music in the background.
Gumball says: "I think I'm ready for my date."
Anais says: "Are you?"
Anais says: "Have you even considered how you're gonna behave on this date?"
Gumball says: "Yeah."
Gumball says: "Probably gonna be well behaved."
Anais says: "I mean like manners and etiquette."
Gumball says: "Uh, uh."
Gumball says: "Ah!"
In Anais' Room.
Anais says: "Start by pouring Ms."
Anais says: "Pumpernickel a cup of tea."
Gumball says: "I don't wanna."
Anais says: "Why?"
Gumball says: "'Cause she's looking at me funny."
Gumball says: "See?"
Anais says: "Gumball, she's a doll."
Anais says: "Why don't you try having a civilized conversation with her?"
Gumball says: "Alright."
Gumball says: "So, how was your day Ms."
Gumball says: "Pumpernickel?"
Pause.
Gumball says: "Oh, I see."
Gumball says: "Too good to talk to me, huh?"
Gumball says: "Ah!"
Gumball says: "Ah ha!"
Gumball says: "Ah!"
Gumball says: "Ah!"
Gumball says: "AH!"
Anais says: "Gumball, just get out of my room."
In the Living Room.
Gumball says: "Okay, so I'm set: got my look, I know where I'm taking her, I'm ready to go!"
Darwin says: "There's one thing you're not ready for..."
Gumball says: "What's that?"
Darwin says: "This!"
Gumball says: "Ow!"
Gumball says: "What was that?"
Darwin says: "The unexpected, and you weren't prepared for it!"
Gumball says: "Oh, uh I-I see what you mean."
Darwin says: "Follow me to the training camp!"
Gumball says: "Where?"
Darwin says: "Just come to the backyard."
Training with Darwin.
Gumball and Darwin are seen in the backyard.
Darwin says: "You've got to be prepared for anything on this date, because anything can happen."
Gumball says: "Like what?"
Darwin says: "What if someone tries to MUG YOU!"
Darwin says: "?"
Gumball says: "I don't know, call the police?"
Darwin says: "Wrong!"
Darwin says: "Knock his block off!"
Gumball says: "Like that?"
Darwin says: "Uh, that was good, but its better to finish with a wisecrack."
Darwin says: "Women love that!"
Gumball says: "Like what?"
Darwin says: "Like..."
Darwin says: ""Welcome to punch town."
Darwin says: "Population: you."
Gumball says: "Are you sure this is gonna help me with my date?"
Darwin says: "Totally."
Gumball says: "Okay..."
Darwin says: "Hi, I'm Penny's father and I don't appvrove of you because you don't have any prospects!"
Gumball says: "Huah!"
Gumball says: "I'm sorry daddy, but you're grounded!"
Darwin Stomps on rake with a cardboard drawing of Sebastian Longquin; in a British voice Oh, hello, I'm Sebastian Longquin, Penny's successful ex boyfriend.
Gumball Huah! Pushes rake Looks like this ex is catching some z's!
Darwin says: "Is that all you got?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Darwin says: "What do you say to someone who doesn't believe in love?"
Gumball says: "Huah!"
Gumball says: "You don't need that heart!"
Darwin says: "Actually, that was a little too extreme, but I'll give you eight out of ten."
Darwin says: "Good job solider."
Gumball leaves smiling.
Darwin says: "The hardest part of my job, is watching them leave."
Ready to Go.
Outside the Wattersons front yard, Richard, Darwin, and Anais are looking at Gumball, who is dressed up in a red coat, a top hat, and a cane.
Gumball says: "So?"
Richard says: "Oh son, you look like a million bucks."
Darwin says: "I'm proud of you buddy, did you remember to TAH!"
Gumball says: "That one was pretty obvious dude."
Darwin says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "This is gonna be the greatest date EVER!"
Date Time.
Gumball rings the doorbell and Penny opens the door. Gumball has his back to the doorway and turns to Penny.
Gumball says: "Hey."
Penny says: "Oh, thanks for coming, Gumball."
Penny says: "You look..."
Penny says: "umm, dressed."
Penny says: "I guess you should come in."
Penny says: "Right."
Inside Penny's house.
Gumball says: "Sooo, what do you want to do today?"
Penny says: "Today is the funeral."
Gumball says: "Oh."
Penny says: "For Mr."
Penny says: "Cuddles, my pet?"
Gumball says: "I mean, pets-pets are great, like part of the family."
Gumball says: "So, what happened to him?"
Penny says: "My dad flushed him down the toilet by mistake."
Gumball says: "That's terrible."
Gumball says: "Did it go around and around or straight down?"
Patrick says: "Straight down."
Patrick says: "I'm Penny's father."
Gumball says: "Hi-yah!"
Gumball says: "Blocked."
Patrick says: "Right."
Patrick says: "Come to the backyard, the service is about to start."
Gumball says: "Penny, I'm sorry."
Gumball says: "I thought this was a date."
Gumball says: "Why didn't you tell me this was a funeral?"
Penny says: "I did."
Penny says: "In the corridor at school."
Flashbacks to Elmore Junior High corridor.
Penny says: "Do you want to come to my house?"
Penny says: "It's Mr."
Penny says: "Cuddles' funeral."
Penny says: "I could use some support from a friend."
Gumball stares at Penny happily.
Penny says: "Gumball, are you even listening?"
Gumball says: "Errr, this Saturday, 4 PM."
Gumball says: "It's-It's a date."
Flashback ends.
Gumball says: "Oh, oh..."
Gumball says: "Oh yeah."
Gumball says: "Don't worry, I'm still here for you, Penny."
Penny says: "Thanks, Gumball."
Mr. Cuddles' Funeral.
Scene changes to the Fitzgeralds' backyard. It is raining, and Judith is playing the bagpipes while everyone stands in silence.
Penny says: "Gumball, perhaps you would like to say a few words about Mr."
Penny says: "Cuddles."
Gumball says: "Err..."
Gumball says: "of course."
Penny says: "Thank you, Gumball."
Penny says: "That was really special."
Polly says: "My picture!"
Gumball says: "Huh?"
Penny says: "My sister made a photo tribute so we can all remember Mr."
Penny says: "Cuddles."
Gumball says: "Aww, how thoughtful."
Polly says: "Wanna see?"
Polly shows Gumball a picture of Mr. Cuddles, a tarantula. As Gumball sees the picture, lightning flashes.
Gumball says: "Aaaaaaaah!"
Gumball says: "A spider!"
Polly starts crying.
Patrick says: "Listen, son."
Patrick says: "I think it's best to leave."
Gumball says: "I'll..."
Gumball says: "let myself out."
Patrick says: "Play on dear."
Gumball says: "Err, sorry."
Gumball says: "It's me again."
Gumball says: "Can I use your bathroom?"
Gumball says: "Because it's kinda little..."
Patrick says: "It's the second to the left upstairs."
Gumball says: "Thanks."
Judith starts playing again.
Gumball says: "Have a nice funeral!"
Patrick says: "Just get out of here!"
Mr. Cuddles Is Alive.
Scene changes to outside the Fitzgeralds' bathroom.
Gumball says: "Aw, man."
Gumball says: "What is wrong with me?"
Gumball says: "She's never gonna forgive me for that."
Gumball says: "I'll spend the rest of my life alone and never find happiness."
Gumball lifts up the toilet bowl lid and Mr. Cuddles appears, hissing at Gumball.
Gumball says: "Aah!"
Gumball says: "A spider!"
Gumball says: "Knock his block off!"
Gumball says: "No wait."
Scene changes to the Fitzgeralds' backyard; Gumball is banging on the bathroom window, trying to get the Fitzgeralds' attention.
Gumball says: "Hey!"
Penny and Polly turn around.
Gumball says: "I found Mr."
Gumball says: "Cuddles!"
Gumball says: "He's on the toilet!"
Polly says: "Is he trying to say something?"
Gumball says: "He's on the toilet!"
Gumball says: "Look!"
Gumball says: "The..."
Gumball says: "toilet!"
Scene cuts back in the bathroom.
Gumball says: "I guess I'll have to show them."
Gumball says: "Come here, little fella."
Gumball's voice distorts to what Mr. Cuddles is hearing as a closeup of Mr. Cuddles' eyes is shown.
Gumball says: "Who's a good spider?"
Gumball says: "Who's a lovely little spider?"
The camera changes back to normal.
Gumball says: "Oh good boy, Mr."
Gumball says: "--  AAAAAAAAAAAAHH!"
Lightning strikes.
Scene changes to outside the bathroom window.
Gumball says: "Get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off!"
Gumball says: "Aaah!"
Gumball says: "Aaah!"
Gumball says: "Aaaaaaaah!"
Gumball then runs across the Fitzgeralds' backyard, slams into the fence, then grabs a shovel and repeatedly hits his face, with Mr. Cuddles still on it.
Gumball then runs across the Fitzgeralds' backyard again, then starts rubbing his face on the dirt.
Penny then catches Mr. Cuddles, and everyone stops singing.
The rain stops, the day turns sunny.
Polly says: "Where did you find him?"
Gumball says: "In the toilet somewhere."
Penny says: "Gumball, this is amazing!"
Gumball says: "Oh, yeah yeah, it's great."
Patrick says: "Son, I stand corrected."
Patrick says: "I thought you were a good-for-nothing young troublemaker."
Gumball says: "Yeah whatever."
Gumball says: "One question, is that spider poisonous?"
Gumball says: "'Cause it just bit me."
Patrick says: "Yeah, but it's like a bee sting."
Patrick says: "You'd have to be bit like a hundred and fifty times for it to be dangerous."
Gumball says: "Okay, thanks."
Gumball says: "If you'll excuse me, I'll..."
Gumball says: "go now."
Gumball says: "Bye."
The Fitzgeralds then watch Gumball walking away slowly. Gumball pauses for a moment, drops to his knees, and falls flat on the ground, unconscious.
Mr. Cuddles Is "Sorry".
Scene changes to the hospital, where Gumball is slowly regaining his consciousness.
Anais says: "Argh, he looks real bad."
Darwin says: "Disgusting."
Nicole says: "He looks awful!"
Richard says: "He'll never play the clarinet again..."
Gumball is then revealed with large swellings all over his body, and has regained his consciousness.
Nicole says: "Shh shh shh, he's waking up!"
Richard says: "Looking good, champ!"
Nicole says: "Someone's here to see you honey!"
Penny says: "Hi, Gumball."
Gumball says: "Hey, Penny."
Penny says: "I brought someone here along who wants to say sorry."
Penny says: "Right, Mr."
Penny says: "Cuddles?"
Mr. Cuddles hisses at Gumball. The screen freezes as he jumps towards Gumball, while everyone gasps in shock. The episode ends.
