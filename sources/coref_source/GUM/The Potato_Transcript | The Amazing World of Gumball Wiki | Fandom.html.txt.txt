The First Step to Recovery.
Idaho is sitting in the cafeteria when Darwin sits next to him, cuts open a potato and starts eating it.
Darwin says: "Mmmm!"
Darwin says: "Fluffy!"
Gumball says: "Hey Idaho, my number one brotato!"
Gumball says: "How's it hangin'?"
Idaho says: "Hmph!"
Darwin says: "What's wrong with him?"
Gumball says: "Isn't it obvious?"
Darwin says: "Umm..."
Darwin says: "nope."
Gumball says: "Dude."
Gumball says: "You're eating potato!"
Gumball says: "In front of Idaho!"
Gumball says: "The potato!"
Darwin says: "That's it!"
Darwin says: "If it upsets Idaho, I'm never gonna eat potato again."
Darwin says: "There are plenty of other foods I like."
Darwin says: "I'll just eat those."
Darwin says: "I'll go ask for some fries."
Gumball says: "Uh, those are potato, too."
Gumball says: "What did you think French fries were made of?"
Darwin says: "French people?"
Gumball says: "SMH dude..."
Gumball says: "SMH..."
Darwin says: "Mmmm."
Just as Darwin opens a bag of chips, Gumball rips the bottom of the bag.
Darwin says: "Huh?"
Gumball says: "Also potatoes."
Darwin says: "Wedges?"
Gumball says: "'Tato."
Darwin says: "Hash browns?"
Gumball says: "'Tato."
Darwin says: "Tater tots?"
Gumball says: "'Tato."
Darwin says: "Croquette?"
Gumball says: "'Tato."
Darwin says: "Patatas bravas?"
Gumball says: "'Tato."
Darwin says: "Potato salad?"
Gumball raises his eyebrow.
Darwin says: "I can't believe I've been so insensitive."
Darwin says: "At least it was only once."
A flashback shows Darwin reading the back of a bag of chips while sitting next to Idaho in the bus.
Darwin says: ""Each chip is sliced and diced, and lowered gently into the boiling oil..."
Another flashback shows students singing as Darwin brings Idaho a potato with a sparkler in it.
Teri says: "Happy birthday, dear Idaho..."
Sarah says: "Happy birthday, dear Idaho..."
Carrie says: "Happy birthday, dear Idaho..."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Happy birthday, dear Idaho..."
The potato bursts into flames, and Darwin is seen in the bus again.
Darwin says: ""..."
Darwin says: "then boiled AGAIN in the boiling oil..."
In another flashback, in class...
Idaho says: "Do you have the time?"
Darwin says: "Sure thing!"
Darwin says: "A quarter after two."
Once again, Darwin is shown in the bus.
Darwin says: ""..."
Darwin says: "before boiling them in boiling oil one final time."
Darwin says: ""  Want one?"
Back to the present, Darwin is face down in his plate.
Darwin says: "I'm so insensitive!"
Gumball says: "Yeah."
Gumball says: "Maybe you need to think about how other people feel."
Darwin says: "Also, I eat way too many potatoes."
Gumball says: "I'm proud of you, buddy."
Gumball says: "Openly admiting you have a problem is the first step to recovery."
Darwin says: "Okay!"
Gumball says: "Dude, that's not the only step to recovery."
Gumball says: "And that chair doesn't have a back on it."
Darwin screams as he falls over.
Gumball says: "And maybe the problem's a lot bigger than you think."
Darwin says: "I do need help."
Quitting Potatoes.
The school bell rings. Gumball and Darwin are in an empty classroom.
Gumball says: "Okay, dude, we've cleared out your locker and your desk."
Gumball says: "Is there anywhere else we've missed?"
Darwin says: "Hmm."
Darwin says: "Is there anywhere else?"
Darwin says: "I don't recall."
Darwin says: "Could there be any other potatoes?"
Gumball grabs the potato taped under Darwin's desk.
Gumball says: "Thanks for leading me to your secret supply."
Gumball grabs another potato behind Darwin.
Darwin says: "Dang."
Gumball says: "Stay strong, bro."
Gumball says: "I know this isn't easy."
Gumball says: "Well, he's coping better than I thought."
Ways to Cope.
Gumball and Darwin are in the library in front of the computers.
Gumball says: "You know, a lot of people find doing something with their hands helps take their mind off cravings."
Gumball says: "Let's search for..."
Gumball says: ""Things to do with your hands."
Gumball says: "Whoa!"
Darwin says: "Whoa!"
Gumball says: "Origami!"
Gumball says: "That's a great idea!"
A bit later, they find themselves surrounded in paper swans.
Gumball says: "Feel any better?"
Darwin says: "Not at all."
Gumball says: "Well, at least it hasn't upset anyone."
Teri says: "Hey, guys, have you seen my parents?"
Teri says: "They were coming in today to see Miss Simian."
Gumball and Darwin look behind them and see two larger paper swans.
Gumball says: "No?"
Darwin says: "No?"
Teri says: "Never mind."
Gumball says: "Clearly, dedication and good intentions aren't working."
Gumball says: "Time to put our faith in something that looks like science, but isn't."
Gumball puts a self-hypnosis CD in Darwin's CD player.
Dr. Zanthor says: "Welcome to Dr."
Dr. Zanthor says: "Zanthor's "Hypnotize Yourself to a Healthier You."
Dr. Zanthor says: "" Listen to the sound of my voice."
Dr. Zanthor says: "You're feeling very sleepy."
Dr. Zanthor says: "You're lying in a field."
Darwin takes off his headphones.
Darwin says: "Hmph."
Gumball says: "Did it help?"
Darwin says: "No!"
Darwin says: "And neither is that!"
Darwin says: "Get those chips out of my face!"
Darwin throws the chips at a fan, causing them to fly all over his face.
Sarah says: "Hey, what are you guys doing?"
Gumball says: "Do we really have to tell you, or will you just admit that you've been eavesdropping and already have a solution?"
Sarah says: "I sure do!"
Sarah says: "Just leave it to Scoop Dogg!"
Gumball says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "Okay."
Gumball says: "Is he coming here, or do we go to him?"
Sarah says: "Neither."
Darwin says: "So, we just..."
Darwin says: "wait here, or..."
Sarah says: "No, no."
Sarah says: "It's me."
Sarah says: "I'm Scoop Dogg."
Sarah says: "It's a new nickname I'm trying."
Gumball says: "Oh."
Darwin says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "That was not at all clear."
A video plays on the computer. It is accompanied by eerie music and shows footage of potatoes being harvested, turned into fries, and being eaten by a child who laughs evilly.
Sarah says: "Did it work?"
Darwin says: "Not really."
Darwin says: "Aversion therapy is just advertising with different music."
Darwin says: "See?"
Darwin clicks another video, which shows the exact same footage as the previous one but with upbeat music.
Darwin says: "Also, it would have worked better if you hadn't wedged my eyes open with French fries."
Darwin throws the fries in his eyes at another fan, and his face is covered in potatoes again.
Darwin says: "Any other bright ideas?"
Sarah says: "How about Mr."
Sarah says: "Small's group therapy?"
Sarah says: "It's really good."
Sarah says: "I've been to every single one to cure my obsessive personality."
Sarah says: "Every..."
Sarah says: "single..."
Sarah says: "one."
Sarah says: "Haven't missed a week."
Sarah says: "Tried to – couldn't."
Group Therapy.
Gumball, Darwin and Sarah sit in Mr. Small's office.
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Is everyone here?"
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Good."
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Welcome to the therapy group."
Gumball says: "Wait, it's just you guys?"
Gumball says: "You can't be a group of two."
Gumball says: "That's a duo."
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Well, I just thought "duo therapy" sounded weird."
Gumball says: "It is weird."
Sarah says: "Oh, oh, oh!"
Sarah says: "I'll start."
Gumball says: "Sarah!"
Gumball says: "This isn't about you!"
Gumball says: "It's about me – helping Darwin to give up potatoes."
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Nature's taste grenade?"
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Why?!"
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "!"
Darwin says: "Because it's upsetting Idaho."
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Very well."
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "I gave up eating meat using the visualization technique."
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Each time I wanted to eat some meat, I would picture it with a face."
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "It was harrowing, but it worked."
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Try it."
Darwin pictures the potato with Idaho's face.
Potato says: "Howdy!"
Darwin says: "Whoa!"
Darwin says: "I think it worked!"
Darwin says: "I don't feel like eating potatoes anymore."
Darwin says: "Thank you, Mr."
Darwin says: "Small."
As Darwin and Mr. Small stand up to hug, Darwin notices a string of sausages on Mr. Small's desk.
Darwin says: "What's that on your desk?"
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Nothing."
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Go back to the part where you were saying what a great duo therapist I am."
Darwin says: "I never said that."
Darwin says: "Is that a string of sausages?"
Darwin says: "And you've got steaks hidden under here!"
Gumball and Sarah gasp.
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Darwin, wait!"
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "It's not what it looks like."
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "I've been hiding meat around my desk because I can't stop eating it!"
Gumball says: "That's exactly what it looks like."
Darwin says: "You're a total fake!"
Darwin says: "That's it!"
Gumball says: "No!"
Sarah says: "No!"
Darwin says: "Huh."
Darwin says: "I don't feel any different."
Darwin says: "Do I look okay?"
Darwin looks at Gumball, Mr. Small and Sarah, who all have potatoes for heads.
Gumball says: "Potato."
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Potato."
Sarah says: "Potato, potato."
Gumball says: "POTATO!"
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "POTATO!"
Sarah says: "POTATO!"
Gumball says: "POTATO!"
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "POTATO!"
Sarah says: "POTATO!"
Potato says: "Hello, Darwin!"
Potato says: "Nice to see you!"
Potato says: "Glad to have you back with us!"
We have things we need to tell you if it isn't too much fuss!
We really can't forgive you when you cut us into pieces!
We wish you hadn't eaten all our nephews and nieces!
Mashed, and baked, and fried, and roasted!
Sautéed, boiled, and grilled, and toasted!
Peeled off all our skin! Dug out all our eyes!
Diced us into wedges and you sliced us into fries!
We are glad we came to see you! One more thing we must discuss!
The final thing we need to say is...
All Potatoes says: "PLEASE, WILL YOU STOP EATING US?!"
All Potatoes says: "!"
All Potatoes says: "?"
Darwin lies on the floor, frothing at the mouth.
Gumball says: "Uh..."
Gumball says: "you okay, buddy?"
Gumball says: "Uh, Mr."
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Don't look at me!"
Good News.
Gumball and Sarah join Idaho at his locker.
Gumball says: "Brotato!"
Gumball says: "We did it!"
Gumball says: "We did it!"
Gumball says: "Darwin's given up eating potatoes!"
Idaho tears up.
Gumball says: "I knew you'd be pleased, but I didn't realize you'd get so emotional."
Idaho says: "I'm not."
Idaho says: "You just shut my hand in the locker."
Gumball says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "Sorry."
Idaho says: "So, what was that about Darwin?"
Gumball says: "He's gone home and locked himself in his room to quit eating potatoes because it was upsetting you."
Idaho says: "Why would I be upset?"
Idaho says: "I'm not the same potatoes as you eat in the canteen."
Idaho says: "Are you saying that all potatoes look the same?"
Gumball says: "Uh..."
Gumball says: "Eh..."
Gumball says: "Uh, uh..."
Sarah says: "Say "no!"
Gumball says: "No?"
Idaho says: "I'm gonna go see Darwin."
Gumball says: "So, it looks like everything worked out well in the end."
Sarah says: "I don't think you understand what just happened."
Sarah says: "Darwin is struggling to battle his potato cravings, and you just let Idaho – the potato – go off and see him!"
Gumball says: "So, we're good?"
Sarah shoves her hand into her face.
Potato-Starved.
Idaho is walking in the streets.
Idaho says: "Phewie!"
Idaho says: "Sure is hot."
Idaho says: "I better put some sunscreen on."
He smears oil over his body.
Idaho says: "Well, plow my furrow!"
Idaho says: "This ain't sunscreen!"
Idaho says: "It's tanning oil!"
Idaho says: "Look at me, getting all crispy!"
At school, Sarah plays a slideshow in front of Gumball.
Sarah says: "Okay, one more time!"
Sarah says: "So, Idaho has gone to see Darwin."
Sarah says: "Remember, Darwin is struggling to resist eating potatoes..."
Gumball says: "If I have a serious expression and nod really slowly, it'll look like I'm listening to every word she's saying."
Sarah says: "Gumball!"
Gumball says: "What?"
Sarah says: "You do realize you said all of that out loud?"
Gumball says: "Quick!"
Gumball says: "Think of a good excuse."
Sarah says: "And that!"
Idaho is still walking, when a worker in a gritter scatters salt over him.
Idaho says: "Hey!"
Idaho says: "What do you think you're doing?!"
Idaho says: "!"
Goblin says: "I'm salting the roads for ice."
Idaho says: "But it's, like, ninety degrees out here, and it's June!"
Goblin says: "I'm so fired."
Back at school, Sarah shows a cardboard model of Gumball's neighborhood.
Sarah says: "Okay, so, here's a model of the block you live on."
Sarah says: "I'm sorry I didn't have time to build it to scale."
Gumball says: "Sarah!"
Gumball says: "We don't have time for this!"
Gumball says: "I just realized that Idaho is on his way to see the potato-starved Darwin and Idaho is a potato!"
Sarah says: "Rrrrr!!"
A truck with the word "Coleslaw" printed on its side drives at full speed in Elmore. Its driver, Hank, tries braking.
Hank says: "Oh, no!"
Hank says: "The truck is out of control!"
Idaho crosses the street as the truck goes faster and faster. Hank panics, but thankfully, he was driving on a road parallel to Idaho's.
Hank says: "Oh."
Hank says: "I guess it's all right."
Idaho finally made it to the Wattersons'. He knocks on the door.
Idaho says: "Darwin?"
Idaho says: "Darwin?"
The door creaks as it opens.
Idaho says: "Darwin?"
Idaho enters the silent house and starts making his way upstairs. The door slams shut on its own, startling him.
Idaho says: "Eh."
Idaho says: "Darwin?"
The door to Gumball and Darwin's room is ajar, and only Darwin's heavy breathing can be heard.
Idaho says: "Darwin?"
Idaho says: "Darwin?"
Darwin turns around with a ravenous expression on his face. Meanwhile, Gumball arrives with Sarah, but struggles to open the door.
Gumball says: "Darwin!"
Gumball says: "Darwin!"
Gumball says: "Don't do it!"
Gumball says: "Open up!"
Gumball says: "Open up!"
Sarah clears her throat, then pushes the door open.
Gumball says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "Thanks."
When Gumball and Sarah enter the room, Darwin is at the desk, eating loudly. Bits of potato are scattered all over the floor.
Gumball says: "Darwin?"
Gumball runs into the room and hurls himself to his knees.
Gumball says: "Nooooooooooo!"
Idaho says: "Gumball?"
Gumball says: "Not now, Idaho!"
Gumball says: "Nooooo!"
Gumball says: "Wait."
Gumball says: "What?"
Darwin says: "Idaho brought me this baked to show me it's okay to eat potatoes, and there's no hard feelings."
Gumball says: "Brotato!"
Gumball says: "You're alive!"
Idaho says: "Hmph!"
Gumball says: "Wait."
Gumball says: "I thought you were upset at Darwin."
Idaho says: "No, I was upset at you!"
Idaho says: "I hate that stupid nickname!"
Sarah says: "Oh, we thought you were annoyed about the potato thing, but you were annoyed about the brotato thing!"
They all laugh.
Gumball says: "Just laugh with them, and they'll think you understand."
Darwin says: "So, we're all gonna pretend we didn't hear him say that, right?"
Sarah says: "Yeah."
Idaho nods in agreement. Episode ends.
