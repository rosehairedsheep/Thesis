Grumpy Morning.
It's morning in Elmore. Then in Gumball and Darwin's room, the alarm clock goes off as a tune. Gumball gets up and dances sleepily.
Gumball says: "Ughhhhh."
Darwin says: "Problem, buddy?"
Gumball says: "I really like this song, but I want to sleep some more."
Gumball says: "Ugh!"
Gumball says: "But I really liked that song."
Darwin says: "Ha!"
Darwin says: "Oh, no problem!"
Darwin says: "Listen to the song, then."
Gumball says: "Ughhhhh!"
Gumball says: "But I want to sleep some more."
Darwin says: "Let’s just have breakfast."
Gumball says: "Ugh!"
Gumball says: "Ugh!"
Gumball says: "Ugh!"
Scene skips to Gumball opening the fridge.
Gumball says: "Ughhhhh!"
Gumball says: "There’s too much food in the fridge, and the milk is at the back."
Gumball says: "But the back's cold."
Darwin sneaks behind him, about to knock him out with a toaster.
Richard says: "Breakfast!"
Darwin says: "It’s okay."
Darwin says: "Dad made us BREAKFAST!"
Gumball says: "Ugh!"
Gumball says: "He used the sausage for the eyebrows instead of the mouth so my breakfast face looks mildly alarmed instead of smiling."
Anais says: "Okay."
Anais says: "Can we stop with the bad vibes, please?"
Anais says: "You’re turning my milk sour."
Gumball says: "Ugh!"
Gumball says: "You don’t understand my pain."
Gumball says: "So don’t judge my life, 'kay?"
Darwin says: "Let’s just watch some TV."
Gumball says: "Ughhhhh!"
Gumball says: "The remote is too far from the couch!"
Darwin says: "No problem!"
Darwin says: "I’ll get it."
Richard says: "Gumball looks sad today."
Richard says: "What should we do?"
Anais says: "I know!"
Anais says: "We should go and buy this poor, privileged kid an incredible surprise present."
Anais says: "So he can have something new to gripe about."
Richard says: "Okay!"
Anais says: "Really?"
Anais says: "Is everyone in this family immune to sarcasm?"
They leave.
Complaints Galore.
Gumball plays a game. He moves his character to talk with another.
Gumball says: "Ughhhh!"
Gumball says: "I love this game, but I don’t have the patience to get into the STORY."
Gumball says: "Ughhh!"
Gumball says: "I pressed a time too many, now we have to go through that whole dialogue AGAIN."
Darwin says: "Ehhhh…  There!"
Darwin says: "You happy now?"
Darwin says: "You put me in a bad mood too!"
Gumball says: "Ughhhh!"
Gumball says: "You’re setting the couch on fire!"
Darwin says: "Ugh!"
Darwin says: "You’re so annoying!"
Gumball says: "Ughh!"
Darwin says: "Ughhh!"
Gumball says: "Ughh!"
Darwin says: "Ughhh!"
Gumball says: "Ughh!"
Darwin says: "Ughhh!"
Gumball says: "Ughh!"
Darwin says: "Ughh!"
Gumball says: "Come on."
Gumball says: "Let’s get outta here."
Gumball says: "I’ve run out of things to moan about."
Out in the Streets.
They walk along some stores.
Gumball says: "Ughh!"
Gumball says: "Dude, your new sneakers are too bright."
Gumball says: "They’re burning my retinas!"
Darwin says: "Dude, you’re making me foot-conscious."
Darwin says: "Come on, help me dirty them up."
Gumball wipes his feet on Darwin's shoes.
Darwin says: "Dirtier."
Gumball wipes his feet on Darwin's shoes again.
Darwin says: "A little more."
Gumball wipes his feet on Darwin's shoes.
Darwin says: "A little more."
Darwin says: "Ughhhh!"
Darwin says: "Too dirty."
Darwin says: "Thanks a lot."
Darwin says: "Now I’m NAKED!"
Gumball says: "Ohh!"
Gumball says: "You’re so moany."
Gumball says: "Just wear these."
Darwin says: "Aah-ohh!"
Darwin says: "Now I look like I got my feet from a grocery store."
Gumball says: "Now I feel overdressed next to you."
Gumball says: "That was my favorite sweater."
Gumball says: "Ughhhhh!"
Darwin says: "Ughhhhh!"
Alan​​​​​ says: "Guys, are you okay?"
Alan​​​​​ says: "You look really, uh..."
Alan​​​​​ says: "waterproof."
Gumball says: "Ughh!"
Gumball says: "Life is horrible, man."
Alan​​​​​ says: "What’s wrong?"
Gumball says: "What's not wrong?"
Gumball says: "I’m starving."
Gumball says: "I’m wearing rags."
Alan​​​​​ says: "THESE CHILDREN NEED HEEEEEELP!"
Nearby, Judith was about to give money to a Hobo.
Judith says: "Oh, my gosh!"
Judith says: "And this."
Gumball says: "I’m pretty sure you’re gonna need that kidney."
Judith says: "Maybe."
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "Aw, I always knew you guys had problems."
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "But I never realized how bad it was."
Gumball's stomach growls.
Hobo says: "Have you eaten today, son?"
Gumball says: "No, I haven’t."
Hobo says: "Eat!"
Gumball says: "Oh-ho-ho!"
Gumball says: "I think there’s a misunderstanding here."
Hobo says: "Pride is important, but sometimes you have to accept the help of others."
Gumball says: "Heh."
Gumball says: "No, sir."
Gumball says: "You don’t understand."
Hobo says: "Swallow your pride and eat!"
Gumball says: "Aah!"
Gumball says: "Okay."
Mister Small​​​​​​ says: "He’s so grateful, he’s got tears in his eyes."
Alison says: "Here you go, kid."
Siciliana says: "It’s not much, but it’ll help."
Gumball says: "People, please!"
Gumball says: "Seriously, we’re not poor!"
Jeff says: "Of course you’re not."
Jeff says: "You’re richer than all of us, in here."
Jeff says: "That’s not your heart, is it?"
Jeff says: "Sorry, I’m a vegetable."
Jeff says: "I don’t really know how you people work."
Darwin says: "Trust me, guys!"
Darwin says: "We’re fine!"
Darwin says: "It’s not like we’re on the streets or anything!"
Gumball says: "Although, technically, we kind of are, since Dad took the car and left."
The crowd gasp.
Felicity says: "I always knew he was a bad parent."
In the Store.
Richard says: "So, what do you think will make him happiest?"
Richard says: "A go-kart or a real pony?"
Anais says: "Why not buy the whole store?"
Anais says: "It only comes to a billion dollars."
Richard says: "Oh."
Richard says: "Okay!"
Anais grabs a glove, and facepalms.
Glove says: "High five!"
Richard says: "Was that sarcasm again?"
Anais says: "Yes!"
Anais says: "So, do you get it now?"
Richard says: "Yeah!"
Anais says: "Are you lying?"
Richard says: "Yeah."
Anais says: "Would you like me to explain it again?"
Richard says: "Yeah."
Raising Money.
A crowd gathers around Gumball and Darwin being rallied on by Mr. Small.
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "So."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "How are we gonna raise money for these poor, broken little children?"
Judith says: "Let’s do a charity calendar!"
Mr. Verde says: "Can we make it a naked calendar?"
Hobo says: "Let’s put on a music festival!"
Mr. Verde says: "Can we make it a naked music festival?"
Alan​​​​​ says: "Let’s do a charity bake!"
Mr. Verde says: "Can we do it naked?"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "All right."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Who keeps saying that?"
Mr. Verde says: "What?"
Mr. Verde says: "All I have is a mustache, and I really want to be involved."
Mr. Verde says: "You guys have to tell me if I need to buy a hat or something."
Gumball says: "Okay."
Gumball says: "I’m going to say this now in a way that is impossible for you to misunderstand."
Gumball says: "I mean only the words I am saying right now."
Gumball says: "There are no hidden meaning or subtexts: we do not need your charity!"
Tony says: "You’re such a brave soul."
Gumball says: "Mm!"
Gumball says: "Mm!"
Gumball says: "Ohh."
Crowd says: "Awww!"
Shopping Again.
Richard says: "Okay."
Richard says: "So, sarcasm is when you say something you don’t mean but with an eyebrow raised?"
Facepalms.
Glove says: "High five!"
Anais says: "Close enough."
Anais says: "Look, why not try it on this lady here?"
Richard runs to the Hexagon Lady.
Richard says: "My nipples are purple!"
Richard says: "Not really."
Richard says: "That was sarcasm."
Glove says: "High five!"
We're Not Poor.
Mr. Small plays a guitar while the crowd watches and cheers.
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Love can set you free."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Because love has got the key!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Love can cross the sea because love can water-ski."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Love can make you live for eternity!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Well, not literally."
The crowd cheers.
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Thank you!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Thank you!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "The response so far has been amazing, but please continue giving so we can spark hope in these kids' hearts and let their spirits burn as bright as these symbolic candles."
Gumball says: "Okay, dude."
Gumball says: "This has gone too far."
Gumball says: "Tell them the truth."
Darwin says: "Why me?"
Gumball says: "Because  you have the megaphone."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Our young friend Darwin wants to say something to you all!"
The crowd cheers again.
Darwin says: "We’re not poor."
The crowd stops.
Banana Bob​​​​​ says: "They lied to u-u-u-us!"
The crowd pulls out pitchforks in fury.
Gumball says: "Hahahahahahaha!"
Gumball says: "People, please!"
Gumball says: "Put down these pitchforks… that you took to the mall for whatever reason."
Gumball says: "We didn’t lie!"
Gumball says: "We’re mega poor, right, Darwin?"
Someone says: "Prove it!"
Gumball says: "Sure!"
Gumball says: "We’re, um… we’re like, so poor that we can’t afford free stuff!"
Gumball says: "We’re so poor that we lick stamps for breakfast!"
Gumball says: "We’re so poor that we opened an e-mail account just to eat the spam!"
Mr. Verde says: "That’s not proof!"
Mr. Verde says: "That’s just jokes stolen from the Internet!"
Mr. Verde says: "These guys are fakes!"
Gumball says: "What do you want from us?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Do you really want to see us eat dog food in our squalor dump of a house, wearing garbage bags?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Is that it?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Would that make you happy?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "No, no."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I believe you."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I’m sorry we ever doubted you."
Darwin says: "NO, DUDE!"
Darwin says: "Come to our house!"
Darwin says: "Come on!"
Darwin says: "Our house’s not good enough for you?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Oh, no, no, no."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I’m… I’m sorry."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I didn’t mean to insult your hospitality."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "S-sure, we’ll come."
Gumball says: "Hahahahaha!"
Gumball says: "Okay!"
Gumball says: "Okay."
Gumball says: "Uh, just give us five minutes to tidy up."
At home, Gumball repeatedly taps Darwin.
Darwin says: "So, what’s the plan?"
Gumball says: "We got to show them what they expect to see."
Gumball says: "Let’s trash everything, fix it all with their big check, and go back to our lives."
Gumball says: "Zip!"
Gumball says: "Before you say anything, do you have a better plan?"
Darwin shakes his head, saying no.
Gumball says: "Then you have two seconds to look as disapproving as you can."
Darwin looks disapproving as Gumball said.
Gumball says: "Good!"
Gumball says: "Now let’s get on with it!"
Darwin says: "I don’t feel comfortable doing this."
Gumball says: "Just remember… It’s all for charity."
Darwin carefully and gently trashes the houses.
Gumball says: "Dude, we’re on the clock here!"
Gumball says: "Smash faster!"
Darwin says: "I’m doing it as fast as I can!"
Gumball says: "Then smash smarter!"
He knocks a table down, and launches an object which causes the curtain to push the lamp over to the TV. This makes the TV explode and part of the ceiling to break down.
Gumball says: "Uh… yeah."
Gumball says: "More like that."
Darwin says: "Hmm."
Darwin says: "We’re gonna need help."
Darwin says: "Come and help, my little friends!"
Crows fly inside.
Darwin says: "Hahaha!"
Darwin says: "Very good!"
Darwin says: "Very good!"
Darwin says: "Come out and spread your disease!"
He sings merrily into the kitchen full of cockroaches.
Darwin says: "Excellent!"
Darwin says: "Good work, everyone!"
Cockroach squeaks.
Darwin says: "What’s that, my little friend?"
Darwin says: "You’re right."
Darwin says: "We need a final touch."
A skunk sprays its odor all over the place.
Darwin says: "Hahahaha!"
Darwin says: "Good job!"
Darwin says: "Good job!"
Gumball says: "So, ready yet?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "Oh, a disreputable dog breed."
Darwin says: "Nice touch."
Gumball says: "“Friendship, understanding, acceptance”?"
Darwin says: "Well, if we have to be vandals, we should at least carry a positive message."
The crowd is heard arriving.
Gumball says: "Uhh!"
Gumball says: "Get in the house!"
Gumball says: "Get in the house!"
Crowd says: "Love can cross the sea."
Gumball says: "Okay, here it goes."
Gumball says: "How do I look?"
Darwin says: "Contagious."
Gumball says: "Good."
Visitors.
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Is that what people call a rat king?"
Gumball says: "No, Mr."
Gumball says: "Small."
Gumball says: "It’s what we call “dinner."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Bring forth the check!"
Banana Bob comes to them with a check, making a melody with his mouth.
Banana Bob​​​​​ says: "Sorry, I just thought it would sound more impressive with some music."
Banana Bob​​​​​ says: "Ne-never mind."
Nicole says: "What is going on here?!"
Nicole says: "!"
Nicole says: "Who trashed the house?!"
Nicole says: "!"
Hobo says: "They trashed the house on purpose!"
Hobo says: "They lie-e-e-ed!"
Crows raises pitchforks in the air.
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Well, you won’t be needing this!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Well, you get the idea."
Gumball says: "No, wait!"
Gumball says: "Now the house is actually trashed, we really do need your help!"
Crowd says: "Ahhh."
Richard says: "Hey, kids!"
Richard says: "I got you jet skis!"
Hobo says: "Your dad is not a monster!"
Crowd raises pitchforks in the air.
Anais says: "No, wait!"
Anais says: "You should see how much Dad spent on these!"
Anais says: "We are broke now!"
Alan​​​​​ says: "So, are you poor or not?"
Richard says: "Yeah, sure."
Richard says: "I’m an unemployed man with three children."
Richard says: "I’m obviously a millionaire."
Crowd raises pitchforks in the air once more.
Anais says: "Eh, bad timing."
Anais says: "But good sarcasm."
Anais and Richard run to the house, screaming.
Darwin says: "Please stop!"
Darwin says: "You guys are insane!"
Crowd says: "Ahhh."
Crowd raises pitchforks in the air once more.
Crowd says: "Ahhh."
Crowd raises pitchforks in the air once more.
Crowd says: "Ahhh."
Crowd raises pitchforks in the air once more.
Crowd says: "Ahhh."
Darwin says: "Or a blurp."
The crowd repeats this until Gumball stops them. While he speaks, his family enters the house.
Gumball says: "Everybody, listen!"
Gumball says: "I think we all learned a very important lesson today, and this lesson is… don’t complain!"
Gumball says: "Be happy with what you got."
Gumball says: "No that’s not the quite right."
Gumball says: "Uh, be careful of what you say!"
Gumball says: "Nah, no, that’s not it either."
Gumball says: "Uh, don’t jump to conclusions!"
Gumball says: "No, no."
Gumball says: "Don’t try to be something you’re not, cause, uh… Be yourself?"
Gumball says: "I don’t know, man."
Gumball says: "Maybe the lesson is sometimes some people do stuff, things happen and it kind of goes nowhere."
Gumball says: "Anyway  thanks for the check."
Gumball says: "Bye!"
He tries to go inside his house, but the check prevents him. Eventually he goes in. Then the episode ends.
