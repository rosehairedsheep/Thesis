Gumball's New Rival?!
Gumball and Darwin sitting in the bleachers at Elmore Stadium. It's a sunny day and the cheerleaders are singing while Penny performs a move.
Cheerleaders says: "One, two, three, four, five, we are Elmore Junior High!"
Cheerleaders says: "Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, spin around and start again!"
Gumball says: "Woo-hoo!"
Gumball says: "That's my girl!"
Penny blows Gumball a kiss and he catches it, and pats it on his chest.
Gumball says: "Right next to my heart, baby."
Darwin says: "Dude, what are you doing?"
Gumball says: "What's the problem, can't a guy celebrate when his cheerleader girlfriend lands an amazing flip on a beautiful sunny day?"
Darwin says: "Okay, I don't know what kind of reality you're living in."
Darwin says: "First of all, this isn't a sunny day."
Lightning fills the screen with light, rain starts pouring and thunder starts roaring.
Darwin says: "Secondly, that move went wrong and you cheered."
Carmen says: "Oh, Penny, are you okay?"
Teri says: "Oh, Penny, are you okay?"
Carmen, Teri and Leslie help up Penny, who is upside down on the ground.
Penny says: "I face planted so hard, I've got grass on my tonsils."
Leslie​​​ says: "Well, someone found it entertaining."
Leslie and Teri look at the camera angrily.
Darwin says: "And finally, she's not your girlfriend."
Gumball says: "What?"
Gumball says: "Well, then how come she blew me this kiss?"
Darwin says: "That's ketchup,  you just smeared it all over yourself."
Gumball says: "What the?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "What's going on?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "What's going on, is you've dragged me here to eat my lunch in the rain, so you can gawk at Penny like you do every day, even though you guys aren't even boyfriend and girlfriend!"
Gumball says: "Oh, yeah, well, you look like a s-swollen..."
Gumball says: "traffic..."
Gumball says: "cone!"
Darwin says: "Sorry, dude, I didn't mean to offend you, I'm not saying it won't happen."
Darwin says: "But right now, you've got some competition."
Leslie​​​ says: "Come on, now, let's get you back inside."
Gumball says: "Who?"
Gumball says: "Leslie?"
Gumball says: "Nah, they're just friends."
Penny says: "Oh, Leslie, what would I do without you?"
Jealousy says: "And that's how it starts!"
Jealousy says: "Soon he'll be her boyfriend and you'll be history."
Gumball says: "No, it's not like that, he's a nice guy."
Jealousy says: "No he's not, and I'm gonna put an end to this, RIGHT NOW!"
Darwin says: "..."
Darwin says: "Wow."
Jealousy runs through the hurdles, passing by Bobert and Jamie, knocking Tobias unconscious with a baton, grabbing a football and hitting all the Elmore football players, and finally, reaches Leslie.
Jealousy says: "Penny..."
Jealousy says: "Leslie..."
Gumball says: "STITCH!"
Tired from all the running, Gumball passes out and sinks into the mud.
Confrontation.
In the school cafeteria, Leslie is talking to Penny about something. Gumball is spying on them with binoculars through the door.
Gumball says: "You see, there's nothing going on."
Gumball says: "They're just eating lunch and chatting."
Darwin says: "What do you think they're saying?"
Jealousy says: "So how do you like my stupid pink petals and my fat yellow face  Oh, I'm so pleased you like it."
Jealousy says: "I use it to steal GIRLS FROM PEOPLE!"
Carrie says: "Who are you talking about?"
Darwin says: "Gumball is jealous of Leslie."
Carrie says: "Leslie?"
Carrie says: "Why?"
Jealousy says: "Because he's trying to steal MY GIRL!"
Jealousy barges into the cafeteria, leaving Carrie and Darwin shocked. Then the scene focuses on Penny and Leslie.
Leslie​​ says: "You know, you should seriously consider becoming a carnivore."
Penny says: "Why?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Because before it ends up on your plate,  this is what they do to vegetables!"
Penny says: "Mm..."
Penny says: "humm..."
Penny says: "yeah."
Penny says: "I'm not sure that baloney is such a good option though."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Well, at least I'm not eating my own kind..."
Leslie's voice turns blurry; Penny sees a possessed Gumball, but doesn't recognize him because he is distant; Gumball strangely runs towards them, but does not appear to get any closer.
Penny says: "Uh-huh."
Jealousy is still running towards them.
Penny says: "Yeah."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "..."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "They're washed in cold water..."
Jealousy is still running, when he finally arrives, he starts slapping Leslie's pot; Leslie pushes him away effortlessly.
Penny says: "Gumball, what is wrong with you?"
Jealousy says: "What's wrong with you?"
Jealousy says: "Hanging out with this loser, instead of me."
Penny says: "Come on, Leslie, let's get out of here."
Gumball says: "Penny, I'm so sorry."
Jealousy says: "No, I'm not!"
Gumball says: "Shut up."
Jealousy says: "You're pathetic."
Jealousy says: "Looks like I have to take care of this myself!"
Carrie says: "Wow."
Darwin says: "I know, I've never seen him like this before."
In the school hallway, a possessed Gumball is talking to Principal Brown.
Jealousy says: "And the case is solved!"
Jealousy says: "Commissioner Brown, arrest this man."
Nigel Brown says: "What are you talking about?"
Jealousy says: "The case of the stolen trophy, which I have just found in his conveniently open locker."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Principal Brown, I think it's pretty obvious what's happened here."
Carrie says: "He did it."
Gumball says: "Huh, what?"
Gumball says: "What's goin' on?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Uh, what's going on, is that we're about to open your locker and find a crowbar."
Gumball says: "Okay."
Jealousy says: "Dude, I wouldn't do that if I were you."
Gumball says: "Why, what did you make me do now?"
Gumball opens his locker and several items, including herbicides and vandalized pictures of Leslie, fall out; Gumball is shocked.
Gumball says: "What's all this?"
Jealousy says: "Um..."
Jealousy says: "Plan B?"
Nigel Brown says: "Wow."
Carrie says: "I know, right."
Resolution.
In Principal Brown's office, Penny stands between Leslie and Gumball.
Penny says: "Gumball, I think you owe Leslie an apology."
Gumball says: "I would apologize but..."
Gumball says: "."
Gumball says: "he'll beat me up again."
Leslie​​​​ says: "Oh!"
Leslie​​​​ says: "I'll do nothing of the sort!"
Gumball says: "Not you, him."
Leslie​​​​ says: "Who?"
Jealousy says: "ME!"
Jealousy says: "You nectar-faced, CO2-breathing, self-pollinating, photosynthesizing, soil-eating, root-drinking, deciduous, petal-headed punk!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "See, he hates me, it's been like this all day!"
Gumball says: "Look, I don't hate you, it's just..."
Gumball says: "I'll explain everything when I get out of prison."
Nigel Brown says: "Prison?"
Nigel Brown says: "Gumball, we're not the police."
Gumball says: "Wait, you mean I'm not wearing handcuffs?"
Nigel Brown says: "Of course not."
Jealousy says: "Well, then, good luck finding me in Mexico!"
Penny says: "Gumball, please make an effort with Leslie."
Gumball says: "Yeah, okay."
A Stroll in The Park.
Scene changes to the park, where Gumball and Leslie are walking together.
Gumball says: "I'm pleased we've got to spend this time together."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Me, too, Penny was right, we do have a lot in common."
Gumball says: "Phew, it's hot."
Gumball says: "Oh, a bench in the shade."
Both of them sigh happily and chuckle.
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You know, after today, I never thought you and me would become friends."
Gumball says: "Well, I guess sometimes life is just full of..."
Jealousy says: "SURPRISE!"
Jealousy pulls a rope, then many slugs, snails, and worms start falling from the tree onto Leslie; Leslie screams and freaks out.
Jealousy says: "Ah..."
Jealousy says: "I see you've met my hungry little friends."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I can't move!"
Jealousy says: "That's right, I glued you to the bench."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "WHYYYYYY—"
Cafeteria Fight.
Scene changes to the school cafeteria as the school bell rings. Penny is eating with Gumball and Darwin.
Penny says: "I'm so pleased you and Leslie are finally getting along."
Darwin says: "Yeah, because for a while there, you completely lost it."
Penny says: "Where is he by the way?"
Gumball says: "Uh..."
Jealousy says: "BUGGING HIM!"
Gumball says: "Nailed it!"
A door is heard being slammed open. Leslie comes in, partially eaten and injured.
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "PENNY, keep away from him!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "He's insane!"
Jealousy says: "How did you get away?"
Jealousy says: "I glued you to the bench!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You glued my pot to the bench!"
The camera shows Leslie, not wearing his pot. The area where it would be is censored.
Penny says: "Oh, Leslie."
Penny says: "Are you okay?"
Jealousy says: "STAY AWAY FROM HER!"
Jealousy says: "AHHHHHHHHH!"
Leslie​​​​​​​ says: "AHHHHHH!"
Jealousy says: "She loves me!"
Jealousy says: "She loves you not!"
Jealousy says: "She loves me!"
Jealousy says: "She loves you not!"
Penny says: "DARWIN, HELP!"
Darwin says: "Dude, chill out!"
Darwin says: "We need to do something!"
Darwin says: "I don't even recognize him anymore!"
Carrie says: "I think I know what to do."
Putting An End to Jealousy.
Scene changes to Carrie's house. An owl hoots off-screen. Carrie is lighting a circle of candles on the floor of her bedroom.
Carrie says: "Don't break the circle of pepper."
Carrie says: "It's our only protection."
Penny says: "From what?"
Carrie says: "Jealousy."
Carrie says: "It's taken possession of his body."
Carrie says: "And it must be EXPELLED!"
Jealousy tries to escape the circle of pepper, pouncing at Carrie, but a green shield keeps him contained.
Carrie says: "Gumball, if you're there, give us a sign."
Gumball shows up in the mirror's reflection; he fogs up the mirror and writes.
Darwin says: ""Writing..."
Darwin says: "in this way..."
Darwin says: "is difficlut."
Darwin says: "" Yeah, that's Gumball, alright."
Carrie says: "Good, it's not too late."
Carrie says: "Now, we must present the root of his jealousy."
Carrie says: "Leslie,  take a step forward."
Leslie​​ says: "I..."
Leslie​​ says: "feel like I'm close enough already, how about you guys take a step back?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Why is he so mean?"
Darwin says: "Come on, man."
Darwin says: "His face isn't that fat."
Penny says: "It's just disproportionate compared to his really weedy body."
Darwin says: "Yeah, and because it's round, it's kind of full-looking, and the yellow makes you focus on it."
Penny says: "So, if it is a little fat, it's not that fat."
Darwin says: "It's just very very plump."
Penny says: "Fat-faced people have feelings too you know, Gumball."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Alright, can we just get this done?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Carrie, what's the next step?"
Carrie says: "Everybody, join me."
Carrie says: "Jealousy begone."
Carrie says: "Jealousy begone, Jealousy begone,  Jealousy begone, JEALOUSY BEGONE, JEALOUSY BEGONE!"
Penny says: "Jealousy begone, Jealousy begone,  Jealousy begone, JEALOUSY BEGONE, JEALOUSY BEGONE!"
Darwin says: "Jealousy begone, Jealousy begone,  Jealousy begone, JEALOUSY BEGONE, JEALOUSY BEGONE!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Jealousy begone, Jealousy begone,  Jealousy begone, JEALOUSY BEGONE, JEALOUSY BEGONE!"
Jealousy says: "AHHHHHH!!!"
Gumball's face glows brightly and Jealousy is released from his body. The camera zooms of the room, and an owl hoots off-screen again. Back in the bedroom, a green flame circles Gumball's body, trying to get out of the circle.
Darwin says: "What is that?"
Carrie says: "It's Jealousy, in its purest form."
Gumball coughs.
Penny says: "Gumball, are you alright?"
Carrie says: "No, no DON'T!"
Penny steps into the circle of pepper and it explodes; Jealousy is released from the circle and starts flying around Carrie's bedroom, cackling.
Jealousy says: "How come you have more comic books than I have?!"
Jealousy says: "!"
Jealousy says: "That makes me ANGRY!"
Darwin says: "Ah, oof, agh!"
Jealousy says: "."
Darwin says: "Ahh!"
Jealousy says: "Aww, I've always wanted a dimmer switch!"
Darwin says: "What do we do?"
Carrie says: "I don't know!"
Darwin says: "What do you mean you don't know?"
Carrie says: "I just read about it on the Internet, I didn't think it wasn't going to work!"
Jealousy says: "How many pairs of shoes do you need?"
Jealousy says: "You don't even have feet!"
A door slams open, revealing an angry Leslie armed with a vacuum cleaner.
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Hey!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Over here, you green freak!"
Darwin says: "Leslie!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "I've got a vacuum bag with your name on it!"
Leslie turns on the vacuum cleaner. It sucks in Carrie, who gets half her face stuck in the vacuum cleaner's tube.
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Ah, no, turn it off, turn it off!"
The vacuum cleaner shorts out, releasing Carrie; her face is deformed in the shape of the tube.
Carrie says: "Gross."
Jealousy says: "And you!"
Gumball says: "Aah!"
Darwin says: "What is he doing?"
Carrie says: "He's gonna explode!"
Carrie says: "Gumball!"
Carrie says: "You have to stop being jealous!"
Gumball says: "I can't!"
Gumball says: "Not as long as Penny is going out with Leslie!"
Darwin says: "Aah!"
Darwin says: "Penny!"
Darwin says: "You gotta break up with Leslie!"
Penny says: "What are you talking about?"
Penny says: "We're not dating, we're cousi—"
Camera cuts to outside Carrie's house while Jealousy explodes with a bright green flash. Then cut to Gumball flying backwards in slow-motion.
Gumball says: "Wait, did you just say he was your cousin?"
Penny says: "Well, duh, everybody knows."
Gumball says: "Well, duh, I didn't."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "There's a lot of things you don't know about me, Gumball."
Gumball says: "Oh."
The slow-motion effect ends and Jealousy implodes, pulling everyone into the center of the room. Everyone is lying down on the ground, panting.
Gumball says: "I wish you said that earlier."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Yeah, so do I."
Gumball says: "Sorry man, I just didn't know."
Penny says: "Well, I think that was a good lesson for you."
Penny says: "Jealousy is a pretty ugly thing, Gumball!"
Gumball says: "Yep!"
Gumball says: "I get it!"
Carrie says: "Haha, that's okay."
Carrie says: "You made it, man!"
Gumball says: "Heheh!"
Jealousy says: "Get your hands off him, you undead, ectoplasmic, transparent, paranormal, spooky, floating, fringe-flicking freak!"
Gumball says: "..."
Darwin says: "..."
Carrie and Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "..."
Gumball says: "Wow."
Darwin says: "Wow."
Carrie and Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Wow."
Episode ends.
