Going to the Mall... Again.
The Wattersons are driving to the Elmore Mall.
Gumball says: "Huh?"
Nicole says: "Oh, come on kids."
Gumball says: "Wait!"
Gumball says: "I know what comes next!"
Gumball says: "Weekends always rule!"
Gumball says: "We're gonna milk a..."
Gumball says: "mule..."
Anais says: "No."
Gumball says: "I-I've definitely seen all this."
Gumball says: "Uh, not now."
Gumball says: "I'm about to flashback."
Gumball says: "Or is it flash-forward?"
Gumball says: "Flash-rewatch?"
Gumball says: "Flash-rewind!"
Gumball says: "Meh, never mind."
Gumball's Flashback.
Flashback to the time the car crashed.
Gumball says: "First, the car was destroyed."
Flashback to when the car was destroyed.
Gumball says: "Everyone was angry at me but it wasn't my fault."
Flashback to when he lost Darwin, Anais, Penny and his parents.
Gumball says: "Then I lost Darwin, Anais, Penny, and Mom and Dad broke up..."
Gumball says: "and none of it was my fault!"
Flashback to the time Rob ruined Penny and Gumball's relationship.
Gumball says: "All of this because Rob hates me!"
Flashback where Gumball accidentally threw Rob's helmet in his face, when Darwin kicked Rob into a manhole and when Rob crashed on the police car from the explosive suitcase.
Gumball says: "Which is kind of my fault."
Flashback where Rob ejected Gumball with the universal remote.
Gumball says: "The remote!"
Gumball says: "He did it all with the remote!"
Flashback where Gumball jumped down into The Void and hit the rewind button on the universal remote.
Gumball says: "I lost everything!"
Gumball says: "But I was given another chance."
Gumball says: "A chance to fix it all!"
Scene cuts back to the present.
Gumball says: "I can change the future!"
The car crashes.
Gumball says: "Dagnabbit."
Gumball says: "I flashbacked for too long."
Everyone walks toward the emergency exit door in the parking lot.
Gumball says: "Guys, trust me!"
Gumball says: "We’ve done all this before!"
Nicole says: "Well, I’m sorry if going to the mall is not original enough for you, Gumball."
Nicole says: "What would you prefer, swimming with dolphins?"
Gumball says: "No!"
Gumball says: "I mean– Wait."
Gumball says: "Was that a real option?"
Nicole says: "I told you to stop playing with that window!"
Gumball says: "I didn’t play with the window, I was flashbacking!"
Flashback to when Gumball was playing with the window while flashbacking.
Nicole says: "But you never listen!"
Gumball says: "–trying to comb the skin of a kiwi fruit!"
Gumball says: "I get it now, it's 'cause the skin's got little hair."
Nicole says: "This is gonna cost us a fortune!"
Nicole says: "Do you think money grows on trees?"
Nicole says: "Oh, I guess it does 'cause it's made out of paper..."
Gumball says: "I've already done this, there’s no way to get a word in."
Gumball says: "Let's move on."
The Truth.
Gumball and Darwin are at Laser Video.
Gumball says: "Trust me, Darwin."
Gumball says: "Rob is gonna destroy us all."
Gumball says: "I've seen the future!"
Darwin says: "Okay, prove it."
Gumball says: "Right."
Gumball says: "Pick a game from the bargain bin."
Darwin takes a game and Gumball starts talking without even looking at the game.
Gumball says: "Extreme Tractor Race."
Gumball says: "Review says: "Here's a cheat code: go left, forward, forward, right, forward, forward, back to the store where you bought it, and ask for a refund."
Darwin says: "You really can tell the future!"
Gumball says: "Yes!"
Darwin says: "No!"
Darwin says: "Whatever you say could alter the future in some terrible way!"
Gumball says: "Yeah, but whatever you do in the present does that anyway."
Darwin says: "Stop!"
Darwin says: "I refuse to know!"
Gumball says: "Dude, you don't have ears; you're just covering your gills."
Gumball says: "You won't hear the future, but you won't live to see it either if you can't breathe."
As Gumball and Darwin argue, Rob sneaks up behind them, clutching the remote.
Darwin says: "We should have adopted something with more brains..."
Darwin says: "like a carrot?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Gumball says: "No!"
Gumball says: "Not this time!"
Darwin says: "You eat old car parts?"
Gumball says: "No no."
Gumball says: "Hold on."
Darwin says: "Rob is messing with your potato?"
Darwin says: "Rob is messing with me?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Gumball says: "Yes!"
Suddenly Darwin inhales all the letters and he begins to choke.
Darwin says: "Where..."
Darwin says: "is..."
Darwin says: "he?"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Curse you."
Gumball says: "Watch out!"
Gumball pushes Darwin out of the way just as Rob hits the 'Eject' button. It does not hit them and instead hits Banana Joe's body, which ejects upwards and smashes against the ceiling, his peel still intact. Larry watches all this with a shocked expression on his face.
Rob​​​​​​ says: "I will destroy you and everyone you love!"
Gumball says: "He's going to make Mom and Dad break up!"
Stopping Rob.
Rob finds Richard and Nicole in the mall. He points the remote at them.
Gumball tackles him and they both fall to the ground.
Gumball says: "Now give me that!"
As they fight for the remote, Gumball accidentally presses the 'Rewind' button on the remote, which is aimed at Nicole and Richard. They gradually get younger and younger.
Richard says: "How about we get some donuts?"
Nicole says: "Whatever."
Richard says: "But I..."
Richard says: "Huh?"
Richard says: "Huh?"
Richard says: "What's going on?"
Nicole says: "Wha– Huh?"
Nicole says: "My acne's back!"
Darwin and Anais appear on the second floor banister.
Darwin says: "Gumball!"
Darwin says: "Press stop!"
Nicole and Richard are now so young their clothes don't fit them anymore. They scream as they disappear into them.
Gumball says: "STOP!!!!"
The remote effectively pauses Richard and Nicole's reversed aging, and for a second they're shielded from sight by their clothes. The children wait in anticipation. Finally, their parents appear–but as babies. The kids are shocked, and Rob takes advantage of the moment to grab the remote and flee.
Gumball says: "Hey!"
Gumball begins to give chase but is stopped by Darwin and Anais, who each hold one of their baby parents; Anais holds Nicole while Darwin holds Richard.
Anais says: "Gumball!"
Anais says: "How did this happen?!"
Anais says: "!"
Anais says: "The short version please!"
Gumball says: "Uh, remote!"
Anais says: "Little less short!"
Gumball says: "Evil nemesis tries to destroy our lives using a magic universal remote!"
The baby parents start crying, so Darwin and Anais put them down on the floor.
Darwin says: "What have we done?"
Gumball says: "Well, I guess life won't be so different for Dad – sleeping all day, wobbling around and putting things in his mouth that don't belong there..."
Darwin says: "I mean, what have we done to the future?"
Anais says: "He's right!"
Gumball says: "We're gonna disappear!"
Anais says: "Exactly."
Gumball says: "Good job."
Gumball says: "T-that was really well illustrated."
Darwin says: "The part where her arm disappeared was great."
Anais checks her arm and they all scream, with even the baby parents starting to cry.
Anais says: "We need to get that remote before we disappear completely!"
They chase after Rob.
Darwin says: "What do we do with Mom and Dad?"
Gumball says: "Exactly what they do with us!"
Rob sees them and hastily throws a soda machine in their way. Gumball and Darwin jump over with ease. Anais follows suit but suddenly her legs shrink and smashes her head on the machine, so Darwin has to carry her.
Gumball says: "Come on!"
Anais says: "I see him!"
They are at the center of the mall. Rob sees them in pursuit and uses the remote to decrease the brightness, making it very dark.
Anais says: "Now I don't!"
Anais says: "Just throw me at him!"
Darwin throws Anais like a bowling ball. Anais lands on Rob's arm and proceeds to bite his arm, causing him to turn up the brightness to see what bit him.
Rob​​​​​​ says: "What?"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Aaargh!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Get off, get off, get off!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Huh?"
Gumball says: "Noooo!"
Darwin says: "Noooo!"
Gumball says: "What have you done to our little sister!"
Gumball says: "?"
Darwin says: "We have a little sister?"
Gumball says: "Do we?"
Gumball says: "No, I think I did it better."
As Gumball watches, horrified, Darwin continues to choke, loses his limbs, reverts to a fish, and immediately asphyxiates to death because he no longer has lungs.
Rob​​​​​​ says: "I warned you!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "EVERYONE YOU LOVE!"
Gumball screams in fury and tries to attack Rob. Rob fast forwards, speeding up Gumball to the escalator and accidentally pushing Penny off the second floor, just like last time. He then pauses time.
Gumball says: "No!"
Gumball says: "Argh!"
Gumball says: "I hope you're happy with yourself, Rob."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "For the last time, my name is Ro– Wait, you got it right."
Gumball says: "Just get on with your stupid monologue."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Wait up, this requires the right mood."
Rob changes the format to a widescreen format and turns down the contrast. Sad music starts to play.
Gumball says: "You know what?"
Gumball says: "Save it, I've heard it all before."
Gumball says: "Poor little me, blah blah blah, you never wanted to be the villain, yada yada, I made you this way, et cetera et cetera."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Uh, I was looking forward to telling you all that."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Well, I guess you didn't see this coming!"
Rob presses the AV button, the Void appears behind Gumball.
Gumball says: "Let's just get to the fight."
The Fight.
Rob grunts and starts to attack Gumball. He manages to block all of Rob's hits effortlessly.
Gumball says: "There's no point, we've already had this fight."
Rob punches Gumball and they fight for the remote. The camera zooms into their faces. The remote flies up and turns everything blurry.
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Ugh, I can't see anything!"
They trip over each other as they try to look for the remote. Rob grabs something, thinking it is the remote.
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Aha!"
The scene cuts to the parking lot, where a car is continuously being turned on and off.
Gumball says: "Yes!"
They both point their respective remotes at each other, only for Rob to realize he is holding car keys.
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Oh, that explains it."
Gumball says: "Enough!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "No no no no NO!"
Gumball accidentally presses 'Mute;' Rob is confused and mouths the word "what?". Gumball unmutes.
Gumball says: "Oh, sorry."
Gumball says: "I said: "You shouldn't have pushed my buttons."
Gumball ejects Rob into the Void.
Gumball says: "Yes!"
Gumball says: "I win, and you lose!"
Gumball says: "And I don't have much time!"
Rescuing Rob from the Void.
Gumball jumps into the Void and lands onto a platform.
Gumball says: "What the what is this place?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Rob?"
Gumball says: "Rob?"
Gumball says: "Rob!"
Rob​ says: "What are you doing here?"
Gumball says: "I came to rescue you."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "Why?"
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "This is where my story ends!"
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "I belong here with the rest of the universe's mistakes, like socks and sandals, the helicopter ejector seat..."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "and whatever that thing is."
The strange elephant-looking creature roars.
Gumball says: "I'm not leaving you here."
Gumball says: "Dagnabbit."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "Leave me alone!"
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "You're the hero, you've won."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "Isn't that enough?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, my thumb's disappeared!"
Gumball says: "Actually, that's pretty bad."
Gumball presses a button and a news reporter appears in the background.
Kip Schlezinger says: "And now, some breaking news."
Gumball says: "What did I do?"
Gumball says: "Oh, I pressed the channel button."
Gumball says: "I got it!"
Gumball says: "Record..."
Gumball points the remote and presses the button towards a floating platform, making it dissappear.
Gumball says: "And play!"
Gumball presses the button which causes Rob to crash into the platform. He then uses the remote to teleport himself closer to Rob until they collide. They float for a while and land on a platform.
Gumball says: "Gotcha!"
Gumball says: "No, no, no, no!"
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "It seems you've run out of luck."
Gumball says: "Not quite."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "And fingers."
Gumball angrily throws the remote and Rob catches it.
Rob says: "Thank you."
Gumball says: "Dagnabbit!"
Gumball braces himself while Rob prepares to push the "Power" button on him, but he struggles to do so.
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "Darn it!"
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "I can't."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "What am I gonna do?"
Gumball says: "Um, whatever you decide, please do it fast!"
Just as the rest of Gumball's body and face begins to disappear, Rob presses the "Rewind" button, sending them both to the mall paused in time.
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "Ugh, I couldn't do it."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "You came all that way to save me."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "You're actually..."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "quite hard to hate."
Gumball says: "So, that means we're friends now?"
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "I guess."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "I'm sorry, I was– I was wrong about you."
Gumball says: "Uh."
Gumball says: "You were wrong about more than that."
Gumball says: "You kinda destroyed everything and everyone I love."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "Hey, it takes a big man to admit he was wrong!"
Gumball says: "And it takes a bigger man not to rub it into the first man's face!"
Gumball says: "..."
Gumball says: "I am not that big a man."
Gumball says: "HA!"
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "I take back what I said about you being hard to hate."
Gumball says: "Sorry."
The camera pans over all the disasters the remote has caused.
Gumball says: "So, how are we gonna sort out this mess?"
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "Not we."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "This is for me to fix."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "I'm going to go back in time."
Gumball says: "Wait."
Gumball says: "Does that mean we won't be friends anymore?"
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "Yeah, I guess none of this will ever have happened, and things will get back to normal."
Gumball says: "I..."
Gumball says: "look forward to being your enemy again in the future?"
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "Heh, me too."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "Goodbye."
Everything Is Back to Normal.
Rob presses the 'Rewind' button, turning Gumball's family back to normal and undoing everything else up until the van.
Rob​ says: "This is too dangerous."
Rob throws the remote to the ground. And the moment it breaks, the remote disappears in some sort of Void-like vortex. Rob then laughs in relief.
Van shopkeeper says: "That remote was twelve ninety-nine."
The Wattersons can be heard singing as their car drives in the background.
The Wattersons says: "We're having fun and nothing can go wrong!"
Rob rolls his eye and the episode ends.
