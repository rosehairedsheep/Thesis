The Superest Mom.
Gumball is making a Mother's Day card in class.
Gumball says: "To the superest mom in the world."
Darwin says: "I think we need more glitter?"
Gumball says: "Dude, this is already so shiny, she'll need sunglasses to read it."
Darwin says: "I don't want her to be disappointed like last year."
Gumball says: "What are you talking about?"
Gumball says: "She loved her Mother's Day present!"
Turns to flashback, Nicole has her eyes closed.
Gumball says: "You can open your eyes now."
Nicole says: "Oh."
Nicole says: "Wow."
Nicole says: "An air freshener."
Gumball says: "No, silly!"
Gumball says: "It's perfume."
Gumball says: "Try some."
Nicole says: "'Course."
Nicole says: "Uh, I'll put some on right away."
Nicole says: "It's..."
Nicole says: "distinctive."
Flashback ends.
Gumball says: "Well, it still smelled nice, kind of like a pine forest."
Darwin says: "She smelled like the inside of a car for months."
Darwin says: "Every time she walked by, I couldn't help but reach out for my seatbelt."
Gumball says: "Well, she won't be disappointed this year!"
Gumball says: "We made the best card."
Their card is shown. On it is "Happy Mother's Day" with a muscular Nicole wearing a cape.
Tobias​ says: "Guys, I'm sorry."
Tobias​ says: "But I think there's a mistake on your card."
Tobias​ says: "It says, "Superest mom," but I'm afraid mine is."
Tobias​ says: "So—"
Gumball says: "Dude, there can only be one superest."
Gumball says: "And the only thing your mom is super at is being super average."
Gumball says: "So—"
Tobias​ says: "What was that?"
Gumball says: "I'm not sure."
Banana Joe says: "Your mom's aren't the superest, mine is!"
Banana Joe says: "It's written right here."
Gumball says: "Dude."
Gumball says: "Just because you wrote something, doesn't mean it's true."
Darwin says: "What is it anyway?"
Banana Joe says: "What do you mean, "What is it?"
Banana Joe says: "" It's a banana!"
He shows his card. On it is "Superest mom" with a sad clown's face. No one says anything, and he puts his arm down.
Gumball says: "Look."
Gumball says: "I don't wanna break anyone's heart here."
Gumball says: "But at the max, your moms could be the superest in your neighborhood."
Darwin says: "Well, sometimes, Mrs."
Darwin says: "Mom drives down their street."
Gumball says: "Oh, yeah, right."
Gumball says: "Superest mom in your house then, tops."
The bell rings. Gumball walks to the door only to be blocked and pushed away by Tobias.
Tobias​​​​​​​​ says: "Back off, man!"
Gumball says: "How 'bout you back off?"
Tobias​​​​​​​​ says: "You back off!"
Banana Joe says: "Ohhhhhhh!"
Banana Joe says: "You back off!"
Darwin says: "Are you guys gonna fight, or dance?"
Gumball​ says: "Eh."
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "Eh."
Banana Joe says: "Eh."
Gumball​ says: "Probably dance."
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "Probably dance."
Banana Joe says: "Probably dance."
Darwin says: "Then how are we gonna settle this?"
Gumball says: "There's only one way to settle this."
Banana Joe says: "We put our moms in a cage!"
Banana Joe says: "Three go in!"
Banana Joe says: "One comes out!"
Banana Joe says: "Three go in!"
Banana Joe says: "One comes out..."
Gumball says: "There's only one morally acceptable way to settle this."
Gumball says: "Let's have a mom-off!"
The Mom-off Begins.
Gumball, Darwin, and Nicole are walking in the mall. Nicole has her eyes covered.
Nicole says: "It's so nice that we're doing something together on Mother's Day."
Nicole says: "I can't wait to see what my surprise will be."
Nicole says: "Is it a back rub?"
Nicole says: "A  I'd love to have it done by a professional this time."
Nicole says: "The last time you guys did it, I had to wear a back brace, and a wig for a month."
Gumball says: "Why don't you um… look around for a couple of hours?"
Gumball says: "There's a little something we need to do."
Nicole says: "Oh, I see-a surprise!"
Gumball and Darwin laugh as they walk over to Tobias and Banana Joe.
Gumball says: "Ha ha ha ha ha-okay."
Gumball says: "Did you bring your moms?"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Yeah!"
Banana Joe says: "Yeah!"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Did you bring your 'boo'?"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "'Cause you're gonna 'hoo'!"
Gumball says: "Well, did you bring your 'f'?"
Gumball says: "'Cause you're gonna 'ail'!"
Darwin says: "Gumball, that makes no sense."
Gumball says: "Well, what would you say?"
Darwin says: "Did you bring your door?"
Darwin says: "'Cause you're gonna get slammed!"
Gumball says: "Yeah, that`s way better."
Gumball says: "Anyway!"
Gumball says: "Just to be clear: none of our moms know what's going on, right?"
Banana Joe says: "My mom never knows what's going on!"
Gumball says: "Good… anyone got any questions?"
Banana Joe says: "Ooh!"
Gumball says: "Yes, Joe?"
Banana Joe says: "Does the question have to be related to the game?"
Gumball says: "Yes."
Gumball says: "Yes it does."
Gumball says: "Any other questions?"
Banana Joe says: "Ooh!"
Banana Joe says: "Ooh!"
Banana Joe says: "Ooh!"
Gumball says: "Yes, Joe?"
Gumball says: "Okay."
Gumball says: "No other questions?"
Gumball says: "Good!"
Gumball says: "Then I declare this mom-off on!"
Gumball says: "First round: speed."
Nicole takes the escalator, smiling peacefully. Then Tobias turns a knob in the escalator control panel, and the escalator reverses. Nicole notices.
Nicole says: "Uh, hello?"
Nicole says: "I think this thing is broken."
Tobias turns the knob further into reverse. Nicole starts walking upwards, and falls down. She gets up, and runs.
Nicole says: "Hey!"
Nicole says: "Stop!"
Nicole says: "Help!"
She hops over other people taking the escalator, and continues running upwards.
Nicole says: "Somebody, DO SOMETHING!"
Despite this, she is able to keep up with the escalator. At the top, Gumball and the rest are watching her.
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Okay."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "You win this one."
He returns the dial to its previous position. Nicole's speed combined with that of the escalator causes her to move so fast she flies off the end of it, and through the roof.
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Next up: Joe's mom in the reflex challenge."
Joe's mom, Banana Barbara, walks around in the supermarket. She stares at everything happily until she gets knocked down by a soda can.
Banana Barbara says: "Ugh!"
Banana Joe and the rest are hiding behind a stack of boxes, with him holding another can.
Darwin says: "I think you should give her a warning."
Darwin says: "This seems kind of unfair."
Once again, Joe's mom, now bruised, walks around and stares at everything. She gets hit again.
Banana Barbara says: "Uh!"
Banana Joe says: "Heads up!"
Darwin says: "Okay."
Darwin says: "What you'd probably want to try is shouting before you throw the can."
Banana Joe says: "Good idea!"
Banana Joe says: "Heads up!"
Once more, his mom is knocked down. They all walk up to her.
Darwin says: "Dude!"
Darwin says: "You should've called from where the can is coming."
Gumball says: "Let's just give her a point for surviving this."
Gumball says: "Next up: Tobias' mom."
Gumball says: "Strength!"
Tobias' mom, Jackie Wilson, is walking in the appliances section. Tobias dumps a refrigerator on her, and she catches it but struggles to lift it up. Gumball, Darwin and Banana Joe gasp. She eventually lifts it up high, making all spectators bulge out their eyes.
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "That's one to me!"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Well, Where'd you think I got my muscles from?"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Go on, kiss it."
He shows off his small muscles. Gumball sighs, and everyone leaves Tobias.
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Okay, I'll kiss you."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Alright, mom, they've gone now."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "You can put it down."
His mom throws the refrigerator, and spins it around. It is revealed that the refrigerator is actually just a cardboard cutout. Tobias and his mom laugh maliciously.
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Ahh."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Cheating."
The Challenge Goes On!
A montage of the mom-off begins while "She's The Best" plays in the background. Darwin carries cards with the numbers of the rounds on them, and announces.
Darwin says: "Round four: agility!"
Gumball knocks over a bottle of oil. Nicole walks over the oil, and manages to surpass the puddle of oil, albeit with struggle. Gumball winks at Tobias. Tobias' mom skates across the oil with a basket. He winks at her. Banana Joe's mom slips and shatters into pieces. Despite this, Banana Joe shows his pride for her.
Darwin now suddenly has long, feminine legs with green heels.
Darwin says: "Round thirty-two: tolerance."
Nicole waits in line. Then Gumball sneaks behind her, and puts a baby who resembles an orange Billy near her. The baby starts poking her.
Darwin says: "Round ninety-four: honesty!"
Tobias sneaks an unpaid shirt into Banana Barbara's basket. She then leaves the store, setting off the alarm.
Jackie says: "Security!"
Banana Barbara gets tackled by security guards as Jackie shakes her head in disapproval.
Darwin says: "Round one-hundred and forty-three: intelligence!"
Banana Barbara tries to get through a revolving door. Frustrated at being unable to, she walks through it while it is rapidly spinning and gets mashed.
Music suddenly stops.
Gumball says: "Dude!"
Gumball says: "What's up with the leg strutting?"
Darwin says: "I'm just putting the "show" in the showdown."
Darwin says: "Am I wrong?"
Gumball says: "Yeah!"
Gumball says: "This is how you leg strut."
Darwin says: "Round one-hundred and ninety-nine: resilience!"
The music restarts.
Nicole grabs a can which turns out to be tied to a string. Pulling it, she causes both sides of the aisle to fall on her. However, her hand sticks out with the can she had taken.
Darwin says: "Coordination!"
Jackie shops while dodging multiple objects.
Jackie​​​​​​​ says: "Duck."
Jackie​​​​​​​ says: "Right."
Jackie​​​​​​​ says: "Duck."
Jackie​​​​​​​ says: "Step."
Jackie​​​​​​​ says: "Relax."
Darwin says: "Compassion!"
Banana Barbara lets Betty into an elevator first, but just as she gets in, the elevator doors slice her into two and ascend.
Darwin says: "Toughness!"
Gumball and Darwin add items to Nicole's bag as she struggles to carry it.
Darwin says: "Endurance!"
Jackie is sprayed by many perfumes. She reveals that she is wearing mask with a mouth drawn on it.
Darwin says: "Sensitivity!"
Banana Barbara plays the piano. On the first notes, the piano breaks and spontaneously catches fire.
Darwin says: "Diplomacy!"
Nicole picks up a shirt and gets tackled by Alison and Judith.
Darwin says: "Reading skills!"
Banana Barbara gets run over by a grocery cart.
Darwin says: "Accountancy!"
Nicole withdraws money from an ATM, but is denied. She roars in fury as the background catches fire.
The Hot Sauce Challenge.
Gumball gives a point to his mom on a scoreboard.
Gumball Okay. This is the decider.
Darwin says: "The hot sauce challenge!"
Darwin says: "Mrs."
Darwin says: "Wilson's up first."
Darwin says: "Can she stomach a spoonful?"
Jackie walks up to Karen at a hot sauce stand, and refuses a spoon of hot sauce.
Darwin says: "Oh, and it's a refusal."
Then she takes the whole bottle.
Darwin says: "What the-?"
Jackie downs the entire hot sauce bottle and Karen gawks ar her.
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "And Mrs."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Wilson wins!"
Everyone notices this.
Gumball says: "Wait a minute."
Gumball says: "Did you just wink at your mom, Tobias?"
Jackie​​​​​​ says: "No."
Gumball says: "Wha-?"
Gumball says: "Did you just cheat, and swap the hot sauce with ketchup?"
Jackie​​​​​​ says: "No."
Gumball says: "Have you guys seriously been cheating all this time?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Jackie​​​​​​ says: "No."
Gumball says: "Do you still think it's necessary to deny it?"
Jackie​​​​​​ says: "No..."
They all walk away. Banana Barbara comes to the hot sauce stand.
Banana Barbara says: "Oh!"
Banana Barbara says: "Hot sauce?"
You Won!
Nicole is exhausted, and panting heavily from the competition. Gumball and Darwin come to her.
Gumball says: "Mom!"
Darwin says: "Mom!"
Gumball says: "You won!"
Darwin says: "You won!"
Nicole says: "What?"
Nicole says: "What do you mean?"
Gumball says: "We had a competition to decide who was the Superest Mom in the world, and you won!"
Nicole says: "Guys, I'm no superhero."
Gumball says: "But you are!"
Gumball says: "You've endured all the trials we've put you through and succeeded!"
Gumball says: "The escalator, the oil, the shelves-everything!"
Nicole says: "GET IN THE CAR!"
Nicole says: "YOU'RE GROUNDED!"
Making Things Right.
Gumball and Darwin walk to the car.
Gumball says: "How can we make it up to her?"
Darwin says: "How about we just sit in the car, and do as she says for once?"
Gumball says: "Nah, she'll be expecting that."
Darwin says: "I'm pretty sure she wouldn't."
Gumball says: "No!"
Gumball says: "We need something big, something bold, something..."
Gumball sees a Mother's Day banner on a nearby car park. We then see Gumball and Darwin painting on it while on a lift.
Gumball says: "That should do it."
Gumball says: ""You're Super, Mom."
Gumball says: "Happy Mother's Day."
Gumball says: "We're sorry."
Darwin says: "Dude, it says here this can only support one person."
The lift moves.
Gumball says: "Eh, don't worry."
Gumball says: "I know exactly what to do."
He starts jumping.
Darwin says: "What are you doing?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Gumball says: "I figured that by jumping up and down, it's like I'm only half a person's weight."
Darwin says: "So if we both do it,  it adds up to one person!"
The lift falls down to the street and both Gumball and Darwin scream as they hang on to the banner.
Gumball says: "How did that not work?"
Darwin says: "Ah!"
Darwin says: "We should've been jumping at the same time."
Gumball says: "Oh, yeah, that makes sense."
Darwin says: "What do we do?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Gumball says: "What a real man does when he's in trouble."
Gumball says: "MOMMY!"
Gumball says: "HELP!"
Gumball says: "MOM!"
Gumball says: "MOM!"
Darwin says: "Dude, there's no point in screaming."
Darwin says: "Mom's at the mall, on the other side of the parking lot."
Darwin says: "She can't hear you."
Super Mom to the Rescue.
Gumball says: "MOMMY!"
Gumball says: "HELP!"
Nicole is sitting at the salon, and suddenly she opens her eyes and gasps, hearing her son's cries for help.
Nicole says: "Did you hear that?"
Blue Elephant says: "Hear what?"
Gumball says: "Told you we should've stayed in the car!"
Darwin says: "Are you kidding me?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Darwin says: "That's what I said!"
Gumball says: "No, man."
Gumball says: "Aw, darn you past Gumball!"
Gumball says: "Why do I never listen?"
Gumball says: "I WISH I WAS A BETTER LISTENER!"
Darwin sighs; Nicole, now outside, jumps over several cars on her way to the boys.
Gumball says: "I think if I pull myself onto that ledge, then I can backflip over that railing then vault over to that open window."
Gumball says: "I know you're not as athletic as me, so just hang on in there, buddy."
Gumball says: "I'll come back for you."
Nicole jumps over more cars.
Billy says: "Mother, look!"
Billy says: "Is it not a bird?"
Billy says: "Is it not a plane?"
Felicity says: "It's a plane, honey."
Billy says: "No, not that."
Billy says: "That."
Nicole says: "Hang in there, boys!"
Green Security Guard says: "Ma'am, you can't come in here."
Green Security Guard says: "It's vehicles only."
At the Parking Lot.
Gumball and Darwin panic.
Nicole says: "KIDS!"
Nicole says: "What floor are you on?"
Gumball says: "It's about level 32!"
Nicole looks at a sign labeling her current floor as "3", making her sigh in exasperation and run up the stairs.
Darwin says: "Ahh, I'm sure one day we'll look back at this and laugh."
Darwin says: "But not today."
The banner tears and swings down to the car park's 16th floor, carrying Gumball and Darwin with it. But it stops as a crowd watches. Darwin then accidentally pulls Gumball's pants down, revealing his underwear, making the crowd react in disgust.
Nicole says: "Kids, where are you?"
Gumball says: "Mom, we're at level 16 now!"
Nicole sighs and heads down.
Gumball says: "MOM!"
Darwin says: "MOM!"
Nicole says: "Are you guys alright?"
Gumball says: "I'm okay!"
Gumball says: "But Darwin isn't as athletic as me, he won't be able to hold on much longer!"
Nicole says: "Hang tight!"
She grabs a fire hose and ties it to her body just as the banner completely tears, leaving Gumball and Darwin screaming as they plummet towards the street. Nicole jumps off the nearest ledge, and the fire hose swings her down towards the boys. She successfully catches them and they swing down to the pavement while Gumball keeps screaming, unaware that he has been saved.
Darwin says: "Dude, we're okay."
Gumball says: "Yeah, yeah I know."
The crowd cheers.
Nicole says: "Kids, that was very dangerous."
Gumball says: "But you proved you're the Superest Mom in the World."
Banana Joe says: "You're the Superest Mom."
Banana Joe says: "At least in my heart."
Banana Barbara says: "No, you're the Superest Mom."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "And here's your Superest Mom card."
Tobias proceeds to angrily tear up the card before his mom can take it.
Nicole says: "Now, kids, you really can do something for me."
Gumball says: "Anything."
Nicole says: "Help me to the car, I think I put my back out."
The fire hose roller Nicole is tied to detaches.
Darwin says: "But you're a superhero."
Gumball says: "Yeah, you're invincible!"
Nicole says: "Kids, for the last time I am not a superhero."
Nicole says: "I just did what any mom would do."
Nicole says: "Now, come on."
Nicole says: "Let's go home!"
Gets hoisted upwards by the fire hose as if she were doing a superhero takeoff, just as the hose roller hits the ground.
Gumball says: "Whoa..."
Darwin says: "Whoa..."
The hose roller crashes to the ground, episode ends.
