Secret Agent Gumball.
The episode starts with Gumball wearing a tuxedo, while being spied on.
Gumball says: "Darwin?"
Gumball says: "Ugh."
Gumball says: "Darwin?"
Gumball says: "Ugh."
Gumball says: "Darwin, where are you?"
Gumball says: "There you are!"
Darwin says: "Aww, man!"
Darwin says: "My makeup's running, and there's no toilet paper in the whole school!"
Gumball says: "You really didn't need to go that far."
Leslie says: "Au contraire, the makeup's great!"
Leslie says: "And the one piece bias-cut polyester pants suit with crystal accents and a bauble hem is totally en vogue!"
Gumball says: "I have no idea what you just said, but hey!"
Gumball says: "What about me?"
Gumball says: "I know."
Horizontal black borders appear, spy music plays.
Gumball says: "A secret agent."
Leslie​​​​​​​ says: "I was gonna say undertaker."
Gumball says: "Oh."
Leslie​​​​​​​ says: "Why are you dressed like that anyway?"
Gumball says: "Well, it all started at swim club."
Leslie​​​​​​​ says: "And?"
Gumball says: "Wait for it..."

Darwin says: "Yeah, I don't think swim club is for you."
Gumball says: "Half the school isn't suited to swim club!"
Gumball says: "I mean, there's Teri."
Gumball says: "You never know which bit of her's gonna clog the filter first."
Gumball says: "And then there's William."
Gumball says: "Surely, the chlorine in the water's gonna sting his..."
Gumball says: "."
Gumball says: "everything."
Darwin says: "Shh!"
Darwin says: "He'll hear you!"
Gumball says: "Doesn't have ears."
William flies by and glares at them, then turns away.
Darwin says: "I think you hurt his feelings!"
Gumball says: "How could you tell?"
Gumball says: "He's kinda hard to read without an eyebrow."
Gumball says: "Or mouth, or cheeks, or nostrils."
A pounding sound is heard. It's Coach, bouncing on the diving board.
Darwin says: "I..."
She dives in, pushing all the water out of the pool. Gumball and Darwin are swept by a wave into the locker room.
Gumball says: "Too late."
Darwin says: "Wait!"
Darwin says: "Where's our clothes?"
Gumball says: "They've been stolen!"
Darwin says: "Ugh."
Darwin says: "You know what this means."
At the Lost and Found.
Joan says: "See?"
Joan says: "A perfect fit!"
Joan says: "And they're exactly like your old clothes!"
Joan says: "..."
Joan says: "Are words that have never been uttered in Lost and Found."
Joan says: "Anyway, you're in luck."
Joan says: "Mr."
Joan says: "Corneille and I do ballroom dancing and our costumes got shrunk in the wash, so..."
Joan says: "This is all I got."
Gumball says: "This is all you have?"
Joan says: "Okay, this is all I have."
Joan says: "Jeez, since when were you so hard on grammar?"
Darwin says: "Without accessories!"
End of flashback.
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Huh."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Wish I'd never asked."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "That flashback was so long I've grown roots!"
Gumball says: "But why the wig?"
Darwin says: "It looks weird without it."
Rocky walks by, holding a ladder.
Rocky says: "Uh, 'scuse me kids."
Rocky says: "Somebody stole the PA speaker and I gotta fix it."
Gumball says: "Well, they will give him some..."
Gumball says: "odd jobs."
Darwin says: "This is how it's gonna be, isn't it?"
Gumball says: "That's what secret agents do, right?"
Gumball says: "Make light quips after horrific workplace accidents!"
A toilet flushing is heard. Principal Brown walks out of the bathroom.
Nigel Brown says: "What is it with this place?"
Nigel Brown says: "People stealing the toilet rolls now!"
Nigel Brown says: "You two!"
Nigel Brown says: "My office!"
Gumball says: "But sir, we didn't steal-  and now I've lost my train of thought completely."
Taking the Case.
In Principal Brown's office.
Nigel Brown says: "Watterson, tell me."
Nigel Brown says: "What do you know about hacking the central intelligence data server?"
Gumball says: "You just bypass the storage controller, tap into the VNX array head, and disable the IDS."
Gumball says: "Why, sir?"
Nigel Brown says: "Anyway, do you know anything about all this stuff being stolen?"
Nigel Brown says: "My thoughts precisely!"
Nigel Brown says: "The toilet roll."
Nigel Brown says: "The PA system."
Nigel Brown says: "And, judging by that Italian waiter outfit, your clothes."
Nigel Brown says: "I want you to find out who's stealing them, what they plan to do with them, and why."
Gumball says: "But sir, why choose me for this mission?"
Nigel Brown says: "Because, Watterson, you and you alone..."
Nigel Brown says: "happened to be passing."
Nigel Brown says: "That's all."
Nigel Brown says: "Oh, and Watterson?"
Gumball says: "Yes, sir?"
Nigel Brown says: "Close the door on the way out."
Nigel Brown says: "And, Watterson?"
Gumball says: "Yes, sir?"
Darwin says: "Just ignore him or we'll never get out!"
In the hallway.
Darwin says: "Okay, so what are we gonna do?"
Gumball says: "Oh, don't worry your pretty face about it."
Gumball says: "Leave it to the professionals."
Gumball says: "Now, there's clearly some evil mastermind behind all this."
Gumball says: "Overseeing his plans in a secret lair, stroking a cat..."
Gumball says: "What the!"
Gumball says: "Darwin?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "Well, you were disrespecting me!"
Gumball says: "Yeah, I'm sorry."
Gumball says: "You're right."
Darwin says: "Thank you."
Gumball says: "You do look weird without the wig."
Gumball says: "What are you doing in here anyway?"
Darwin says: "Checking the surveillance!"
Gumball says: "Of course!"
Gumball says: "An agent is only as good as his intelligence."
Darwin says: "Yep."
Darwin says: "That rules us out."
Gumball says: "Okay, someone else's intelligence."
Gumball says: "And I think I know just the robot."
Darwin says: "Bobert!"
Gumball says: "Yes, I was trying to be mysterious."
Gumball says: "YES!"
Gumball says: "All right!"
A Clue from Bobert.
In Miss Simian's classroom, Gumball is interviewing Bobert.
Gumball says: "So, Bobert, we need you to help us work out who's been stealing-  actually, scrap that, we need GADGETS!!"
Gumball says: "What's this?"
Bobert says: "It looks like an ordinary fountain pen."
Gumball says: "Yeah?"
Darwin says: "Yeah?"
Gumball says: "Yeah?"
Darwin says: "Yeah?"
Bobert says: "Because it is an ordinary fountain pen."
Gumball says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "What about this?"
Bobert says: "Now pay attention."
Bobert says: "A typical black belt, but turn the buckle like so, and it is a typical brown belt."
Darwin says: "What about this?"
Gumball says: "Dude, that's just a flower."
Gumball says: "But hey!"
Bobert says: "Friendless dork on prom night!"
Bobert starts glitching and is picked up. A force throws him onto the glass and tears his arms off. Bobert drops onto the floor while his arms go out the window.
Darwin says: "Bobert, are you okay?"
Gumball says: "Look!"
Gumball says: "There goes the stolen stuff!"
Gumball says: "We better go after it!"
Darwin says: "What about Bobert?"
Gumball says: "Oh, he seems..."
Gumball says: "armless enough."
Darwin says: "That's not what I asked."
Bobert says: "Just go and find my arms, please."
I Know Who the Villain Is!
Gumball says: "Come on!"
Darwin says: "I'm doing all this in heels, remember?"
They pass by the Bananas, who are painting their fence.
Gumball says: "Oh!"
Gumball says: "Guys!"
Gumball says: "Did you see anything fly by here?"
Banana Bob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "No, I didn't."
Gumball says: "Come on!"
Banana Bob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "But..."
Banana Bob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "my top lip!"
Banana Bob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "It's naked!"
Banana Barbara says: "Let me fix that."
Banana Barbara says: "There."
All the flying objects turn a corner, but then disappear.
Darwin says: "What?"
Darwin says: "Where did it all go?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Gumball says: "Don't worry, we'll find it."
Gumball says: "A secret agent must use every means at his disposal to achieve his objective."
Gumball says: "Stealth, intelligence,  tenacity, a British car, grappling hooks..."
Gumball says: "."
Darwin says: "You!"
Darwin says: "Gumball!"
Darwin says: "I know who it is!"
Darwin says: "It's-  WAAAAAAAHHHH!!"
Gumball says: "..."
Gumball says: "."
Gumball says: "wet wipes, all kinds of insurance..."
Gumball says: ".."
Darwin says: "GUMBALL!"
Gumball says: "Oh, you're down there."
Gumball says: "Hold on, I'm coming!"
We see a Leonard Daniels lookalike with hair exactly like Darwin's wig. Next to her, the real Leonard picks up the real discarded wig. .
Leonard Daniels says: "Look, Bernice!"
Leonard Daniels says: "That cat just flung a wig at us."
An Unlikely Villain.
In the sewers. Darwin is tied to a chair.
Darwin says: "Gumball?"
Darwin says: "GUMBALL!"
Darwin says: "GUMBALL!!"
Mysterious Voice says: "It is no use."
Mysterious Voice says: "Nobody can hear you."
Mysterious Voice says: "My identity will remain a secret as long as you're down here."
Darwin says: "You won't get away with this!"
Mysterious Voice says: "And who is going to stop me?"
Gumball appears from inside a pipe.
Gumball says: "I am!"
Gumball says: "I knew I'd find you sewer or later!"
He grabs onto a smaller pipe and starts to slide down when he loses his grip and falls the rest of the way. The pipe tips over, making a perfect bridge to a bigger pipe.
Gumball says: "Aw, come on!"
Darwin says: "Gumball!"
Darwin says: "I know who the villain is!"
Darwin says: "It's—"
The mysterious voice reveals himself to be William, with a makeshift body made from all the stolen items.
William says: "Me!"
William says: "For years I've been ignored."
William says: "Ridiculed."
William says: "A literal no-body!"
William says: "Well, not anymore!"
Gumball says: "Sorry, who are you?"
Darwin says: "It's William!"
Darwin says: "Can't you see?"
Darwin says: "The PA system, Bob's mustache, the toilet rolls?"
William says: "That's right!"
William says: "I, William, stole it all!"
Gumball says: "Wait!"
Gumball says: "What about our clothes?"
William says: "I didn't steal your clothes!"
William says: "Why would I steal your clothes?"
William says: "Come, come, give me some credit for having a little taste."
Darwin says: "Oh, yeah, we left them in the locker, didn't we?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, well maybe you should've stolen a full-length mirror."
Gumball says: "You look like an accident in a thrift store!"
William says: "WHAT??!!"
William says: "!!"
Darwin says: "I, uh, think we better get out of here and tell Principal Brown!"
William says: "No!"
He traps Gumball and Darwin under shopping carts weighed down by an enormous pipe.
Gumball says: "AAAHHH!!!"
Darwin says: "AAAHHH!!!"
William says: "I'll get to Principal Brown and tell him you did it!"
William says: "You were at every crime scene, you were the prime suspects!"
William says: "YOU WILL TAKE THE BLAME!!"
Gumball says: "Yeah, but you are literally made of the evidence."
William says: "Good point."
William says: "I'll leave him a note."
Gumball says: "Well he, uh, never did have a head for heights."
Darwin says: "At least make them relevant!"
Darwin says: "Come on!"
Darwin says: "Help me with this!"
Darwin says: "We're about to be framed for something we didn't do!"
Gumball says: "Nah, it could be worse."
Gumball says: "At least it's not filling with—"
Water starts shooting out of one of the pipes, filling up the room. They panic.
Darwin says: "AAAAAHHHHH!!!"
Darwin says: "NOW WHAT?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Gumball says: "I got it!"
Darwin says: "Yeah?"
Gumball says: "I think the..."
Gumball says: "body of evidence is in our favor!"
Darwin says: "No!!"
Gumball says: "Ah, stop panicking!"
Gumball says: "You're a fish!"
Gumball says: "You can breathe underwater!"
Darwin says: "Yeah, but you can't!"
Gumball realizes this and starts screaming along with his brother.
Gumball says: "SOMEBODY HELP US!"
Gumball says: "HELP US PLEASE!!"
Gumball says: "HELP!!!"
Suddenly, a laser slices the pipe in two. The boys free themselves and look up to see Bobert.
Gumball says: "Bobert!"
Darwin says: "Bobert!"
Bobert swoops in, picks them up, and flies them out of the sewer.
Gumball says: "Of course!"
Gumball says: "There's a homing device in my flower!"
Bobert says: "No, it's in my arms."
Bobert says: "And they're heading to the school!"
Darwin says: "Wait!"
Darwin says: "Without your arms, how are you steering?"
Bobert says: "Good point!"
A Great Escape.
Bobert says: "I'm in control!"
Bobert says: "But out of gas."
They fall into an ambulance, and ride out the back on a stretcher. They are headed for a collision with Granny Jojo and Louie's car.
Louie says: "Ahead two-thirds!"
Their car veers out of the way just in time, but now the stretcher is nearing the unfinished bridge. Gumball screams as they fly off the ramp and almost make it, but hit the side and are now falling into the water.
Gumball says: "I can't swim!!"
Bobert says: "You won't have to!"
Bobert dives in and morphs into a submarine of sorts. Gumball is inside him while Darwin swims beside them, going noticeably faster.
Gumball says: "This is fast as it goes?"
Gumball says: "Oh, wait, what does this button do?"
Bobert says: "Nonono—"
Gumball shoots out of the water. Bobert and Darwin fly beside him.
Bobert says: "It's the ejector seat."
Bobert says: "Mayday!"
Bobert says: "Mayday!"
Bobert turns into a parachute, and the three land safely on top of a train. .
Darwin says: "Yeah, Bobert!"
Darwin says: "You're invincib—"
Gumball says: "Darwin!!"
Gumball says: "Don't worry, leave it to Double—"
Gumball, knocked out, rolls off the train and down a hill. He bounces down the streets of Elmore, until he reaches Elmore Junior High. He slides down the halls and stops right in front of Principal Brown's door, his tux disheveled. William catches up shortly after.
William says: "You're too late!"
Gumball says: "Am I?"
Gumball says: "I think you'll find I've got a license to spill, the beans!"
Gumball says: "On you, just to be clear."
Nigel Brown says: "Yes?"
William quickly ditches his "body," and all the stolen items fall on the floor around Gumball.
Gumball says: "Principal Brown!"
Gumball says: "I did it!"
Nigel Brown says: "You did it?!"
Nigel Brown says: "!"
Nigel Brown says: "And to think I trusted you!"
Gumball says: "What?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Nonono!"
Gumball says: "I meant the mission."
Gumball says: "I completed it!"
Gumball says: "The culprit's right here!"
Nigel Brown says: "Other Watterson?"
Nigel Brown says: "I should've known."
Nigel Brown says: "But robot child, I'm very disappointed in you."
Nigel Brown says: "Detention for all three of you!"
Darwin says: "No!"
Darwin says: "But it was William!"
Nigel Brown says: "William?!"
Nigel Brown says: "!"
Nigel Brown says: "Who's William?"
Gumball says: "That one."
Nigel Brown says: "Don't be ridiculous."
Nigel Brown says: "Where's your proof?"
Bobert says: "Gumball, give him your flower."
Gumball says: "I, uh..."
Gumball says: "don't see how that's gonna help."
Bobert says: "No, open the stem."
He does, and there's a recording device inside.
William says: "I, William, stole it all."
Nigel Brown says: "Really?!"
Nigel Brown says: "!"
Nigel Brown says: "A week's detention for you!"
Gumball says: "William."
Darwin says: "William."
Bobert says: "William."
Nigel Brown says: "William."
Nigel Brown says: "And return all this stuff at once!"
Nigel Brown says: "But not this."
He walks off. William goes after him, followed by all the stolen items.
Gumball says: "Let's, uh, get out of these old things, hm?"
Watterson, Gumball Watterson.
Back at the Lost and Found, Gumball and Darwin are back in their regular clothes and are checking the tux and pantsuit back in.
Joan says: "Okay, I just need to sign these back in."
Joan says: "Your name?"
Gumball says: "Watterson, Gumball Watterson."
Joan says: "Is that all one word or with a hyphen?"
Gumball says: "What?"
Joan says: "Like Wattersongumballwatterson, or Watterson Gumball-Watterson?"
Gumball says: "Nonononono."
Gumball says: "It's..."
Gumball says: "Watterson."
Gumball says: "Gumball Watterson."
Joan says: "Like double-barrelled?"
Gumball says: "No, Watterson!"
Gumball says: "Gumball Watterson!"
Joan says: "Oh, so Gumball's your middle name!"
Gumball says: "Just forget it."
