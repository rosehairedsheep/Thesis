Richard's Condition.
Richard and Nicole are in the living room.
Nicole says: "So, remember, you've got to vacuum the living room, sort out the fridge, and don't forget to take out the trash."
Richard says: "Yes, commander."
Nicole says: "Very good."
Nicole says: "See you later."
Richard says: "Mooooooove."
Richard says: "Mooooooooove."
Gumball and Darwin peek out from behind the sofa.
Gumball says: "Psst."
Gumball says: "Dad, you wanna play?"
Richard says: "Ugh!"
Richard says: "Unh!"
Richard says: "I can't play right now."
Richard says: "Can't you see I'm taking out the trash?"
Darwin says: "But you promised to play with us."
Richard says: "Huh?"
Gumball and Darwin take the bag out but when they are nearly at the bin they realised that they have been tricked.
Gumball says: "We are just taking out the trash, aren't we?"
Darwin says: "Yeah."
Richard is taking a nap on the sofa and Gumball and Darwin returns.
Gumball says: "Dad!"
Gumball says: "You tricked us!"
Gumball says: "That was no game."
Richard says: "Sorry!"
Richard says: "I've got a medical condition called laziness."
Gumball says: "Yeah?"
Gumball says: "Well, from now on, we're gonna be the lazy ones."
Darwin says: "Hmph!"
Richard says: "you'll do mine for the rest of your life!"
Richard says: "How's that sound?"
Gumball says: "Hmm..."
Darwin says: "Hmm..."
Gumball says: "sounds pretty fair."
Darwin says: "sounds pretty fair."
Richard says: "Okay, then."
Richard says: "Let the lazy-off begin!"
Richard, Gumball and Darwin are watching TV, Richard is eating potato chips.
Announcer says: "Ike Hitcher meets Rod Ironknuckle fist to fist."
Announcer says: "Thumb-wrestling federation tonight at nine o'clock."
Darwin says: "What do we do?"
Gumball says: "We just do everything dad does."
Richard eats a cookie, they do the same; Richard drinks soda, they do the same again.
Gumball says: "He just never stops."
Gumball and Darwin burp.
Darwin says: "Hey, you got a little something on your face."
Gumball says: "Where?"
Darwin says: "There!"
Gumball says: "Ow!"
Darwin says: "Sorry!"
Darwin says: "I-I don't know what's happening to me!"
Darwin says: "I'm all tingly!"
Gumball says: "Eh, me too, buddy!"
Gumball says: "What's going on?"
Inside Gumball's body, we can see sugar cubes tickling his heart.
Sugar Cubes says: "Everywhere you look and everywhere you go Sugar, sugar, sugar from your head to your toe."
Sugar Cubes says: "When you've eaten lots of sugar and you've had too much Watch out, everybody, it's a sugar rush."
Sugar Cubes says: "Watch out, everybody, it's a sugar rush."
Gumball's Heart says: "It tickles!"
Scene changes back to the living room.
Gumball says: "Dad!"
Gumball says: "We need a timeout."
Gumball says: "We're gonna find someone else to beat you."
Richard says: "Sure."
Richard says: "But I have to warn you -- I'm invincible!"
Gumball says: "Come on, Darwin!"
Gumball says: "Let's go!"
Instead of opening the door, they tear it down, and leave quickly in a trail of fire.
Who's Lazy Larry?
Gumball and Darwin pass by the senior citizens, then they stop and reverse back.
Gumball says: "Excuse me?"
Gumball says: "We need to find someone to beat our dad in a lazy-off."
Gumball says: "Is there anyone you can think of that can beat him in a lazy-off?"
Donald says: "What did he say?"
Marvin says: "He's just saying he needs to find a guy to beat his pop in a lazy-off."
Betty​ says: "How about Lazy Larry?"
Gumball says: "Who's Lazy Larry?"
Donald says: "It's a long story, son, that goes way back to the summer of eighty-three."
A flashback was going to start but Gumball and Darwin interrupt it by experiencing a a sugar low.
Darwin says: "What's happening?"
Gumball says: "I don't know."
Inside Gumball's body, we can see his heart sad and alone.
Gumball's Heart says: "Everything was fast, now everything is slow."
Gumball's Heart says: "I'm all alone in my sugar low."
Gumball's Heart says: "Where did everybody go?!"
Gumball's Heart says: "!"
Scene changes back to the outside.
Marvin says: "Never mind."
Marvin says: "Just go and see Lazy Larry."
Marvin says: "He works at the convenience store."
Gumball says: "Thank you, senior citizens."
Darwin says: "Thank you, senior citizens."
Donald says: "What did he say?"
