What Is the Theme?
Gumball and Darwin grab their backpacks and are about to go to school.
Darwin says: "Wait, isn't there some kind of theme at school this week?"
Gumball says: "Argh, I hate all these theme weeks!"
Gumball says: "Cake week, cake crumb cleanup week, ant week, how do we get rid of ants week, anteaters week, how do we get rid of anteaters week."
Gumball says: "What is it this week?"
Darwin says: "Technology week?"
Gumball says: "No, that was three weeks ago."
Flashback to three weeks ago. Gumball and Darwin are standing in the hallway with Bobert, dressed up like robots.
Gumball says: "Happy technology week, Bobert!"
Gumball says: "Hey, who's your little friend?"
Bobert says: "That is a vacuum cleaner."
Bobert says: "Do you assume all machines know each other?"
Gumball tries to say something to defend himself against Bobert's sound argument, but he cannot. He and Darwin silently walk away toward a flight of stairs.
Darwin says: "Dude, Technology week, remember?"
Gumball says: "Yeah-huh."
Gumball and Darwin move like robots. Darwin moves his cardboard robot body but gets exhausted after only four tiny steps.  Gumball barely makes it up to the second step of the stairs before he falls onto his back with his arms and legs still moving, like a robot.
Bobert says: "Not helping."
The flashback ends.
Gumball says: "Oh, we haven't done history week!"
Darwin says: "No, you haven't done history week."
Flashback to history week. Darwin is walking down the hall and sees Gumball dressed up like a panda.
Darwin says: "Why are you dressed as a panda?"
Darwin says: "It's history week."
Darwin says: "Endangered species week was last week."
Gumball says: "Exactly."
Gumball says: "I'm dressed up as last week, that's history, right?"
Gumball says: "Anyway, surely pandas are history by now."
Darwin says: "You just forgot, didn't you?"
Gumball says: "Yup."
The flashback ends.
Darwin says: "Okay, we're definitely going to mess this up again!"
Darwin says: "We don't even know what the theme is!"
Gumball says: "Don't worry, I've got this."
Green Week.
Darwin says: "I'm not sure about this."
Gumball and Darwin are wearing multiple parts of different themed costumes.
Gumball says: "Ah, come on."
Gumball says: "Chill."
Gumball says: "We've got all the bases covered."
The bus comes to a stop, and Gumball and Darwin board it.
Gumball and Darwin says: "Huh?"
The students already on the bus are wearing several environmentally-themed constumes.
Gumball says: "Oh, it's green week."
Rocky says: "Yeah!"
Rocky says: "I even filled up the bus with cod liver oil instead of gas!"
The bus suddenly breaks down and comes to a stop.
Rocky says: "Wait, it's sunflower oil that works in engines."
Rocky says: "Well, looks like you're walking to school."
Rocky says: "And it was so difficult squeezing all those fish into the gas tank."
All the students are seen walking on the sidewalk to reach school.
Darwin says: "Sarah, great detail!"
Darwin says: "Even your ice caps are melting."
Sarah says: "Actually, it's just a hot day, but thanks for pointing it out, Darwin."
Sarah scrapes off some of her globe face-painting making it look like it's really melting. Gumball and Darwin see a tired Tobias with a green gradient over him.
Gumball says: "Whoa!"
Gumball says: "Love the green rainbow, Tobias!"
Tobias​​ says: "It's not a costume..."
Tobias​​ says: "I think I have food poisoning—"
Gumball says: "Ugh!"
Darwin says: "Ugh!"
Gumball says: "Hey, Bobert!"
Gumball says: "Thank goodness."
Gumball says: "Glad we're not the only ones who've done nothing for Green Week—"
Bobert looks like he's been shut down.
Gumball says: "Bobert?"
Gumball says: "Installing updates?"
Teri says: "Actually, Bobert is taking part."
Teri says: "He turns himself off every night."
Teri says: "Unfortunately it takes him ninety minutes to reboot."
Darwin says: "Oh."
Darwin says: "We are the only ones then."
Gumball says: "Ah, well, it's only Green Week."
Gumball says: "I mean there's nothing special about plants."
Gumball says: "Think about it."
Gumball says: "Superheroes are all named after animals and insects for a reason."
Gumball says: "By silently standing in a field with nothing but the power of going bald annually."
Sarah says: "I can already see the merch!"
Gumball says: "Yup, plants are pointless."
Leslie​​​​ says: "Eh-hem!"
Leslie​​​​ says: "I'm a plant!"
Leslie​​​​ says: "I think we're pretty important!"
Gumball says: "Leslie!"
Gumball says: "Yeah, m-me too!"
Gumball says: "Plants do loads of important things!"
Leslie​​​​ says: "Really?"
Leslie​​​​ says: "Name one."
Gumball says: "Only one?"
Gumball says: "But there's so many!"
Leslie​​​​ says: "Okay, then give me five."
Gumball says: "Let's just start with one, shall we?"
Leslie​​​​ says: "Okay, then give me one."
Gumball says: "Uuuuuuhhhhh..."
Gumball says: "..."
Gumball says: "."
Gumball says: "salad!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Salad?"
Gumball says: "Yeah..."
Gumball says: "..."
Gumball says: "yeah, this whole thing is coming out wrong!"
Gumball says: "Lettuce-I mean let us forget about it!"
Gumball says: "It's clearly thorny issue."
Gumball says: "Thorny!"
Gumball says: "?"
Gumball says: "Uhh, we should just nip it in the bud."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "No, let's not!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "That phrase is actually incredibly offensive to plants!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Hmph!"
Gumball says: "Leslie, wait!"
Gumball says: "Let me explain!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Okay."
Gumball says: "Ah, sorry, I got nothin'."
Gumball says: "I didn't think you'd actually turn around."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Hmph!"
Darwin says: "You wanna do it, or shall I?"
Gumball says: "You do it."
Darwin shoves Gumball's feet into his mouth.
Some Research on Plants.
Elmore Junior High, in the hallway.
Gumball says: "I can't believe Leslie thinks I don't care about plants!"
Darwin says: "Well, do you?"
Gumball says: "Yeah!"
Gumball says: "I care loads!"
Gumball says: "What about the, you know, big thing?"
Gumball says: "The big green thing?"
Darwin says: "The woods?"
Gumball says: "No no, the other one."
Gumball says: "Bigger."
Gumball says: "The wet one."
Darwin says: "The rainforest?"
Gumball says: "The rainforest!"
Gumball says: "Yeah, the rainforest."
Darwin says: "What about the rainforest?"
Gumball says: "Well, isn't it that there's too much of it?"
Gumball says: "Or..."
Gumball says: "."
Gumball says: "not enough?"
Darwin says: "Which one?"
Gumball says: "Too much?"
Darwin says: "Wrong."
Darwin says: "If you wanna get Leslie to forgive you, you're going to have to do a whole lot of research."
Gumball says: "Oh yeah."
Gumball says: "Absolutely."
Gumball says: "I mean, that's very important, of course."
Gumball says: "About what?"
Darwin says: "PLANTS!"
At the school library. Gumball approaches the librarian, who is turned around at her desk.
Gumball says: "Excuse me, I'm—"
Tree Librarian says: "Computers one, three, and four work."
Tree Librarian says: "Please surf responsibly."
Gumball says: "Actually, I'm here for some books."
Tree Librarian says: "WHAT??!!"
Tree Librarian says: "!!"
Tree Librarian says: "Shh!"
Tree Librarian says: "Quiet!"
Tree Librarian says: "Sorry, I'm just excited!"
Tree Librarian says: "Kids only come here for the computers!"
Gumball says: "Yeah, no, I wanna learn about the history of plant culture!"
Tree Librarian says: "Ah, you're in luck!"
Tree Librarian says: "I'm doing a lecture on plant history soon, and—"
Gumball says: "Ooooh, sorry, I'm..."
Gumball says: "busy that day."
Darwin says: "She didn't say when it was."
Gumball says: "Could I just have the notes?"
The librarian reaches behind her and slams a huge stack of papers onto her desk.
Gumball says: "Do the notes have notes?"
She reaches behind her again and slams another huge stack onto her desk.
Gumball says: "Could you just summarize it for me?"
Tree Librarian says: "You want me to summarize the entirety of plant culture and history?"
Gumball says: "Yeah!"
Gumball says: "Preferably in one word."
Tree Librarian says: "Photosynthesis."
Gumball says: "One that I know?"
Tree Librarian says: "Out!"
Back in the hallway.
Gumball says: "Well, I did learn one thing: the word photosynthesis."
Gumball says: "It's my way in!"
Darwin says: "Do you even know what it means?"
Gumball says: "That's not the point."
Gumball says: "Like, why would you bother learning Australian when you can just wear the hat with the dangly cords and skip right to the good stuff?"
Darwin says: "Is Australian a language?"
Gumball says: "Hm."
Gumball says: "I guess we'll never know."
Gumball says: "Anyway, I'm gonna go talk to Leslie about sotophynthesis before I forget how to say it."
Darwin says: "Photosynthesis."
Gumball says: "Yep!"
Gumball says: "Photosynthe-see you later!"
An Amazing Photosynthesis Session.
In the courtyard, Leslie is reading while Gumball walks in front of him, talking on his phone.
Gumball says: "Yeah, yeah, totally."
Gumball says: "It was an amazing photosynthesis session."
Phone says: "Calling Darwin."
Gumball says: "Oh hey, Leslie!"
Gumball says: "How's it growin', my man?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "So, you've been photosynthesizing?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "Isn't that more of a plant thing?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, but I just respect the plant culture so much I got into it, you know?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "Really?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, I've already done, like ppphhh, eight hours today."
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "But the sun wasn't up eight hours ago."
Gumball says: "Mmh."
Gumball says: "I got a method."
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "Well, I was about to do some now, do you wanna join me?"
Gumball says: "Cool, yeah, count me in!"
Gumball says: "I might just do mine in the shade, though."
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "Hah!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "Nice one."
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "Right."
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "Let's face the sun full-on so we can really get into it!"
Gumball says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "Yeah, of course."
Gumball says: "It's gotta be in direct sunlight, I was just kidding."
Gumball says: "That was a joke I got from..."
Gumball says: "."
Gumball says: "uh, Photosynthesis Weekly!"
Gumball says: "MONTHLY!!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "Oh, you read PM too?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "What did you think of the latest issue?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "Controversial, right?"
Gumball says: "I think..."
Gumball says: "everything that can be said about it has been said!"
Gumball says: "Cool, cool."
Later, Leslie is happily photosynthesizing while Gumball is completely dehydrated.
Gumball says: "Aaahh!"
Gumball says: "Gotta love that heat, right?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "Ho-ho, you wait till it really kicks in at noon!"
Noon. The sun is blistering. Gumball is even more dried out than before, while Leslie still photosynthesizes peacefully.
Gumball says: "How long have we got now?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "'Bout three minutes."
Gumball says: "Hooooo!!"
Gumball says: "Have you got any water?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "Sure!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "You gotta have water for the session, right?"
Leslie takes a water bottle from his backpack and hands it to Gumball, who starts to drink from it.
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "What are you doing?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "Plants drink like this!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "Drink up!"
Gumball says: "Aaaaahhhhh!!"
The bell rings.
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "I've gotta go."
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "But a guy your size, you're gonna wanna stay out here for at least another couple of hours, right?"
Gumball responds with a dehydrated scream.
Leslie​​​​​​​​ says: "Oh-okay, time for me to leaf!"
Suddenly, two blue arms rip out from underneath Gumball's dried-up skin. A newly shed Gumball tears out, completely naked, and curls up on the ground, shivering in fear. As ominous music plays, Banana Joe, in the background, sees this, and his eyes go wide in terror. Cut to him pulling the same expression on the bus and then in the shower, still holding his ice cream which gradually melts.
Banana Barbara says: "Joe, honey!"
Banana Barbara says: "Dinner's ready!"
Joe is still traumatized at the dinner table. His mom serves him dinner.
Banana Barbara says: "Did you have a nice day at school?"
Banana Joe says: "No."
Banana Joe says: "No, I did not."
Drawing a Line Under It.
Meanwhile, in Gumball and Darwin's bedroom, with the camera outside of the house.
Gumball says: "It was just totally uncalled for!"
Gumball says: "Right?"
Darwin says: "Yes."
Gumball says: "And you're sure only plants can photosynthesize?"
Darwin says: "Yes."
Gumball says: "So he obviously knew, and he didn't tell me!"
Gumball says: "He took it too far, right?"
Darwin says: "Yes!"
The camera cuts inside the bedroom. Darwin turns on the light, with his eyes being red and baggy.
Darwin says: "Can we please just go to sleep?"
Gumball is sitting in an ice bath inside Darwin's fishbowl, bright red and steaming.
Gumball says: "Sorry."
Gumball says: "It's hard to get comfortable when even your teeth have third-degree sunburns."
Darwin says: "Look, you upset him and he got you back."
Darwin says: "Maybe you should just draw a line under it."
Gumball says: "Oh, I'm going to draw a line under it alright."
Darwin says: "Good."
Darwin says: "I feel like we're on different pages here."
Gumball says: "No, no, draw a line under it, I get it, I understand."
Gumball says: "TO EMPHASIZE IT!!!"
Darwin turns the light off and sighs, defeated.
It's a Plant Thing.
Lunchtime in the cafeteria. Leslie is drinking from an orange juice carton, and Gumball approaches him.
Gumball says: "Mind if I join you?"
Gumball says: "BUDDY?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Don't you usually have lunch with Darwin?"
Gumball says: "Oh, he had other plans, something to do with me going too far, people getting hurt, that sort of thing."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "So you're not eating?"
Gumball says: "'Cuz that's what plants eat, right?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Oh, absolutely."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "We eat soil all the time."
Gumball says: "Great."
Gumball says: "'Cause I brought enough for two."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Yeah."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Actually, I've already eaten lunch."
Gumball says: "No you haven't."
Gumball says: "I've been watching you for the last three hours and I'm absolutely sure you haven't had lunch."
Gumball says: "So tuck in."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Heh..."
Gumball says: "Unless this isn't a plant thing."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "No, no!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "It's a plant thing!"
Leslie tentatively puts the dirt into his mouth. Gumball does the same. They both chew disgustedly, but don't swallow.
Gumball says: "Clumpy!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Well, you know what else is a plant thing?"
Cut to the two on the street next to a fire truck. Leslie is turning on the hose, with Gumball in its trajectory.
Gumball says: "And you're sure this is a plant thing?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "'Course!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "We get watered every day!"
Gumball says: "But does the pressure have to be so high?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Probably."
Leslie grabs the hose as the water comes on, and a massive jet of water shoots Gumball across the street and up a waterslide Tobias is about to ride. He falls off the slide.
Rocky says: "Dude!"
Rocky says: "One at a time!"
The Doughnut Sheriff and two french fry cops are examining a crime scene by the road.
Donut Sheriff says: "Luckily, all the evidence has been preserved, so this should be an open-and-check case."
Donut Sheriff says: "And that's lunch."
The Melted Cheese Guy is finishing a marathon, but is exhausted and can't go on.
Melted Cheese Guy says: "Ah, it's gonna take a miracle for me to finish this race!"
He notices Gumball zooming towards him and gladly readies himself for impact, but the water jet misses him.
Melted Cheese Guy says: "Ah, to heck with this."
The scene cuts to Gumball opening of a box full of bees, releasing them into the classroom from the outside of the window.
Gumball says: "Naw, it's a plant thing!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​ says: "But aren't they dangerous?"
Gumball says: "Eh, it's fine as long as you don't aggravate them."
Gumball says: "After all, bees are just overweight wasps!"
Gumball closes the window, puts sunglasses on leaves Leslie in the classroom, freaking out as the bees swarm his face.
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Ahh!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Aaah!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Oh!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​ says: "AAAAHH!!!"
Leslie; covered in bee stings throws bird seed at Gumball to attract woodpeckers to peck at him.
Gumball says: "Don't tell me."
Gumball says: "Plant thing?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Guess so."
Leslie is chained to the bottom of the lake while Gumball wear scuba gear. Both of them talk, making bubbles. The bubbles reach the surface and pop, revealing what they said.
Leslie​​​​​ says: "Plant thing?"
Gumball​​​​​​ says: "Yeah."
Finally, Gumball and a evil grinning Leslie are shown skydiving without parachutes.
Gumball​ says: "AAH!"
Gumball​ says: "OKAY!"
Gumball​ says: "I GIVE IN!"
Gumball​ says: "I might not know anything about plants, but skydiving without a parachute is definitely NOT A PLANT THING!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Aha!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "So you admit it!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You DON'T know anything about plants!"
Gumball says: "Aha!"
Gumball says: "So YOU admit that you were aware I didn't know anything about plants when you put me through all that stuff!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Aha!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Then if you were aware that I knew that you knew that I was aware, why didn't you say anything?"
Gumball says: "Aha!"
Gumball says: "Uh—"
Gumball says: "no!"
Gumball says: "Wait!"
Gumball says: "I didn't follow any of that."
Gumball says: "Look, we'd better call a truce before this escalates any further!"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Weed?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Is that another plant joke?"
Gumball says: "What?"
Gumball says: "No!"
Gumball says: "Leslie, I'm sorry I called plants pointless."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "And I'm sorry I made you stand waist-deep in fresh manure!"
They embrace in a warm hug.
Gumball says: "Friends?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "'Till the end!"
Gumball says: "Which, judging by the speed the ground is coming up, is in about five seconds."
They scream and brace for impact, until they are pulled up like a parachute. Gumball looks up at Leslie, and we see he has transformed into a dandelion weed, significantly slowing down their fall.
Gumball says: "Wow."
Gumball says: "Where did that come from?"
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "I don't know."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Plant thing, I guess."
They both land gracefully to the ground.
Gumball says: "Well, thanks for teaching me something new."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "Yeah."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "I'm not really convinced you learned anything about plants, but I guess we better get out of here."
Leslie​​​​​​​​​ says: "I mean, you're gonna wanna go home and get milked, right?"
Gumball says: "Cool, cool."
Gumball says: "Wait, you think all mammals get—"
Episode ends.
