A Lesson in Recycling.
Episode starts in a dramatic setting as Gumball reaches for a glowing blue crystal and epic music plays. He is about to grab it when a voice is heard.
Darwin says: "Gumball!!"
Darwin says: "Think about what you're doing!"
Gumball says: "I have..."
Gumball says: "to save..."
Gumball says: "the planet!!"
Darwin says: "Yes, but you're supposed to rinse it out and peel off the label first!"
Gumball says: "Ugh."
Scene transitions to reality; they are standing by some recycling bins in front of a store, and the diamond has turned into a bottle.
Gumball says: "Why do they have to make recycling so complicated?"
Darwin says: "Dude, any time you recycle anything, you act as if you're single-handedly saving the world."
Gumball says: "Ugh, I'll just throw it in the regular trash."
Gumball says: "It's easier to carry the guilt than to carry the bottle."
Right as Gumball nonchalantly throws the bottle over his shoulder, Mr. Small swiftly bursts out from the store doors.
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Nooooo!"
He does a slow-mo diving save for the bottle, but it hits him square in the stomach with a "honk" sound. Back to normal speed as he flops to the ground.
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I misjudged!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "You have to recycle this!"
Gumball says: "Ugh, but I never know which bin to use."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Then you need to learn more about recycling."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Take a leaf from my book."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Well, don't actually take a leaf, 'cuz that would harm the tree that the book was made from."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Actually, don't make a book at all, because the trees are dying!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Just—"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "use recycled paper, okay?"
Gumball says: "Who wants to use something that's already been used?"
Gumball says: "Isn't it weird making new stuff out of old stuff?"
A shot of Mr. Small's season one design appears. As he says his next line, a two-second clip of him talking is continuously looped.
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "With today's sophisticated recycling techniques, you can reuse old stuff and most people can never tell the difference."
Gumball says: "Nah, I think it just looks cheap."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "All I'm saying is, we all need to be aware of the impact we're having on the planet."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Look at me."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I have so little impact that when I'm gone, it'll be like I never even existed!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Doesn't that sound fulfilling?"
Gumball says: "No!"
Gumball says: "If we ruin this planet, can't we just move on to the next one?"
Gumball says: "It's what the founding fathers would have done."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "It's exactly that kind of glib attitude that led to the near-extinction of the great Stink Ape of Elmore Woods."
Gumball says: "Wow."
Gumball says: "That ape must've been seriously glib for it to lead to its own extinction."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I will make this as clear as I possibly can."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "The people were glib; the ape was not glib."
Gumball says: "How do you  know the ape wasn't glib?"
Darwin says: "I guess everyone has a bad day sometimes."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Right."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I-I-I feel like we're getting away from the point."
Gumball says: "That's true."
Gumball says: "I don't even know what glib means."
Gumball says: "Uh—"
Gumball says: "why is this Bigfoot-creature thing called the Stink Ape anyway?"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Its scent was reminiscent of a skunk."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Or rotting flesh."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Or rotting skunk flesh."
Gumball says: "And just to confirm, you wanna save  this animal, not destroy it with fire?"
Gumball says: "Wait—"
Gumball says: "I can definitely smell something!"
Gumball says: "Can you smell it, Darwin?"
Darwin says: "It smells like miscellaneous herbs and body odor."
Gumball says: "Uh, I was going for THE STINK OF HYPOCRISY!!!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Excuse me!"
Gumball says: "Well, everything you do has an impact on something."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Not me!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Come, walk a mile in my  sandals, I'll show you."
Gumball says: "I don't think those things can last a mile, but whatever."
I've Never Harmed a Single Living Thing!
Scene cuts to Gumball, Darwin, and Mr. Small walking into Organic 'n' Stuff, a small hipster-style grocery store. Larry greets them at the counter.
Larry says: "Welcome to Organic 'n' Stuff!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Sure, it may take me roughly three tanks of gas and a full set of tires to get me my groceries, but all the food here is locally sourced."
Gumball says: "Really?"
Gumball says: "Were the coconuts locally sourced?"
Gumball says: "And the Hungarian goulash?"
Gumball says: "And this Himalayan goat curd?"
Gumball says: "How did that  get here?"
Darwin says: "Truck, truck, boat, train, plane, truck, tanker, moped, truck, unicycle."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Well, it was locally sourced in its country of origin."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Thanks, Larry."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Hey, am I paying extra for this warm feeling inside?"
Larry says: "Ha ha!"
Larry says: "Yes."
Outside the store.
Gumball says: "But Mr."
Gumball says: "Small, how can you justify having money?"
Gumball says: "It's made from paper, which comes from trees, which need to be cut down."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "But—"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I also use a bank card."
Gumball says: "A plastic bank card, perchance?"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "FINE!!"
Gumball says: "Littering, Mr."
Gumball says: "Small?"
Gumball says: "Really?"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Ugh."
Scene cuts next to Gumball, Darwin, and Mr. Small walking into Tea 'n' Stuff, a hipster coffee and tea shop that looks suspiciously similar to Organic 'n' Stuff. Larry greets them once again at the counter.
Larry says: "Welcome to Tea 'n' Stuff!"
Larry says: "What kind of blend are you vibing today?"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah, just my usual."
Gumball says: "Haven't we already been in here?"
Larry says: "Ha-ha, no."
Larry says: "Tea 'n' Stuff is not connected to Organic 'n' Stuff, and neither of them are affiliates or subsidiaries of Chanax Incorporated."
Gumball says: "Are you sure about that?"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Of course."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "They do poetry readings and jazz nights."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "There's a chalkboard with inspirational messages on it."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "It can't be a big corporation."
Gumball says: "Look closer, Mr."
Gumball says: "Small."
[Sure enough says: "on a poster, in the initial letters on the chalkboard, even on a tattoo on Larry's arm."
the Chanax name is hidden everywhere in the store says: "on a poster, in the initial letters on the chalkboard, even on a tattoo on Larry's arm."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Fine!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Then I'll just drink tap water!"
Gumball says: "Just accept it."
Gumball says: "Everyone has an impact on something."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Well, not me!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I have never harmed a single living thing!"
Larry says: "Hey, he hasn't paid!"
Gumball says: "But it says the water's complimentary."
Larry says: "Yes, but the paper cup is thirteen fifty."
Living In the Forest.
Mr. Small drives away from the store.
Young Microbe says: "I'm home!"
Young Microbe says: "Oh hey, Patch!"
Young Microbe says: "Hey, buddy!"
Young Microbe says: "Mom, Dad, I've got some news!"
Young Microbe says: "I got into Yale!"
Young Microbe says: "For microbes."
Microbe Mom says: "Oh, we're so proud of you!"
Microbe Dad says: "A chip off the old cell lining."
Microbe Dad says: "Twenty-four generations of our family have lived in this water for almost an hour and you'll be the first to go to university, son!"
Suddenly, they are all swept away by a wave, screaming. It is revealed to be Mr. Small drinking the water. Back to reality.
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "What have I done?!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "!"
Fly says: "What did I ever do to you?!"
Fly says: "!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I'm so sorry!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "AAAHHHHH!!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I'M A MONSTER!!!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Sorry."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Sorry."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Sorry!"
Later, in a sun-filled forest clearing.
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Ah."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Maybe this is meant to be."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I am meant to be completely at one with nature!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "EMBRACE ME, EARTH MOTHER!!!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Or don't."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I guess you wanna be more of an earth aunt who only calls once a year."
A few days later. It's a beautiful day in the forest, but Mr. Small is exhausted, hungry, and covered in dirt and twigs. He finds a squirrel, who mimes to him that he is hungry.
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Hungry?"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Yeah, I am hungry."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Lead on, little buddy."
The squirrel hops off, and Mr. Small crawls after him. They arrive at a small clearing, where a hungry horde of squirrels awaits. They all ravenously attack him and start biting.
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "AAHH!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "AAAAAHHHH!!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "He meant he  was hungry!"
Mr. Small is now walking through a river. He lifts up his leg and finds a leech.
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "AAHH!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "A LEECH!!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Well, take what you need, I've got more than enough."
Some time later, Mr. Small is meditating and some butterflies land on him.
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Ah, beautiful."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Not all nature is out to get me."
The Pain of Guilt.
Meanwhile, at Elmore Junior High in Miss Simian's classroom.
Nigel Brown says: "Now class, it seems Mr."
Nigel Brown says: "Small has taken a leave of absence."
Nigel Brown says: "And his senses..."
Nigel Brown says: "so I'll be taking his class today."
Darwin says: "Do you feel bad about Mr."
Darwin says: "Small?"
Gumball says: "No, I mean he's always struck me as the type of guy who would eventually throw his life away and go live in the woods."
Gumball says: "I don’t think it has anything to with me."
Gumball says: "My conscience is clear."
Enters Gumball's conscience, with different Gumballs trying to put up with the guilt.
Other Gumball 1 says: "Captain, what is wrong?"
Gumball says: "Nothing's wrong."
Gumball says: "Put up the denial shields."
Other Gumball 1 says: "They're already at maximum!"
Other Gumball 1 says: "They won't take any more."
Other Gumball 2 says: "Captain, we appear to be running low on soda on one of the vending machines on level three."
Gumball says: "Why would you tell me that now?"
Other Gumball 2 says: "Well, excuse me for wanting to be a part of something."
Other Gumball 1 says: "The denial shields are down!"
Other Gumball 1 says: "Facts are getting in!"
Gumball says: "Prepare for emotional impact."
Back to Miss Simian’s classroom.
Gumball says: "Yeah, you’re right, I feel super guilty."
Gumball says: "And the ship's out of soda."
Darwin says: "Huh?"
Gumball says: "Nothing."
Gumball says: "Look, we gotta see if he’s okay."
Gumball says: "I mean, it’s probably too late, but maybe we can help identify him."
Finding Mister Small.
Nighttime. Gumball and Darwin are out in Elmore Woods.
Gumball says: "MISTER SMALL!!!"
Gumball says: "MISTER SMALL!!!"
Darwin says: "Dude, don't shout!"
Darwin says: "There could be anything out here."
Darwin says: "You'll make us a target!"
Gumball says: "Good point."
Gumball says: "I'll do a different voice."
Gumball says: "That way whatever comes won't know it's us!"
Gumball says: "Mister Sma-all!!"
Gumball says: "Mister Sma-AAAAAHHHH!!"
They fall into a hole and land in front of a cave. Heavy breathing is heard from inside the cave.
Gumball says: "Uh- you okay?"
Gumball says: "Dude, you need to get some exercise."
Gumball says: "You sound like a French bulldog in a sauna."
Darwin says: "That's not me."
Darwin says: "And..."
Darwin says: "Can you smell something?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, it kinda smells like rotting flesh!"
Darwin says: "Or a skunk!"
Gumball says: "OR ROTTING SKUNK FLESH!!"
Darwin says: "OR ROTTING SKUNK FLESH!!"
Two bright red eyes open from inside the cave. The two turn around in fear.
Darwin says: "It's the ape!"
Gumball says: "On three."
Gumball says: "One, two, three..."
Gumball says: "Why did you run?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "You counted down!"
Darwin says: "Who does a countdown to nothing?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Gumball says: "Lonely people on New Year's Eve?"
Darwin says: "Yeah."
Darwin says: "Fair point."
Darwin says: "It's right outside!"
Darwin says: "What do we do?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Gumball says: "We're gonna roll this thing!"
Gumball says: "Maybe one more roll?"
Darwin says: "Yeah."
Gumball says: "Ah, that's better."
Gumball says: "Okay, the coast is cle-AAAAHHHH!!!"
Gumball says: "This is it."
Gumball says: "It's all over."
Darwin reaches out his hand, and Gumball takes it. He quickly pulls back.
Darwin says: "Ugh!"
Darwin says: "Your hands are really sweaty!"
Gumball says: "Yeah, I know, I'm sorry about that, but I didn't want to leave you hanging."
Gumball says: "And I didn't have time to wipe."
The shadow gets closer. The boys grab each other.
Gumball says: "DAAAAAHHHHH!!!!"
Darwin says: "DAAAAAHHHHH!!!!"
The light comes on the shadowy figure. It's none other than Mr. Small, battered and filthy.
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Boys!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I'm so glad you're okay!"
Darwin says: "Mr."
Darwin says: "Small!!"
Gumball says: "Why were you chasing us?"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I was trying to warn you!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "These woods are not safe!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Trust me."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "These have been the hardest eight months of my life!"
Gumball says: "You've been gone half a day."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I figured I would not survive another winter."
Darwin says: "But on the plus side, you're living at one with nature."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "And it's all thanks to you!"
Gumball says: "It seems you've buried the stink of hypocrisy under a far worse smell."
Darwin says: "We thought you were the Stink Ape!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Ho-ho!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I'm afraid it doesn't exist."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I've been out here long enough to know that there's no such thing."
Darwin says: "But if there's no Stink Ape, what's so dangerous about the woods?"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Oh, I've set traps everywhere."
Gumball says: "Wait, traps?"
Gumball says: "You're a vegetarian."
Gumball says: "What happened to living on nuts and berries?"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Turns out there's competition for the nuts and berries."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "And..."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "turns out the competition is tastier than the nuts and berries."
Gumball says: "Okay, but if there's no Stink Ape..."
Gumball says: "."
Gumball says: "what's that?"
Another shadowy figure walks towards them. Glowing mushrooms grow on the ground where it steps.
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Oh my goodness!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "It's real!"
Darwin says: "Will it be okay?"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I don't know."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "This is one of my more brutal traps."
Gumball says: "Eh, it's just a hole."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "I think I was doing less damage in the real world."
Gumball says: "Uh, see you back at school tomorrow?"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Yeah."
