Too Much Television.
Darwin and Gumball are sitting on the couch watching TV, eating chips, their eyes are red from watching too much TV.
Darwin says: "Can you think of any better way to spend our lives?"
Gumball says: "Dude, I can't even think."
Gumball says: "Is my heart still beating?"
Darwin checks if Gumball's heart is beating and they get worried, because it doesn't seem to be. Luckily, in a couple of seconds it starts beating.
Gumball says: "Keep flicking."
The following words are heard as they switch channels.
TV message says: "Listen!"
Gumball says: "Hmm."
Gumball says: "That was strange."
Darwin says: "Yeah."
Gumball says: "Keep flicking."
Darwin switches channels again.
The Near End of the World.
Gumball and Darwin are sitting in the bus, suddenly they hear Gary screaming.
Gary says: "The end is near!"
Gary says: "The end is near!"
Gary says: "The end is near!"
Gary says: "The end is near!"
Gumball and Darwin look at each other worriedly as the bus leaves.
Gary says: "The end is near!"
Gary says: "For our discount sale, so hurry up!"
Gumball and Darwin are sitting on a bench while eating their sandwiches, suddenly a flock of birds flies by.
Gumball says: "That's weird."
Gumball says: "Where do you think all those birds are going?"
Anton says: "Please let me go!"
All the birds fly to Anton and he screams.
Gumball says: "Okay, there's something going on here."
Darwin says: "Yeah, first there was this weird message from the TV."
Gumball says: "Then the weird guy with his sign."
Darwin says: "And now the animals are acting weird."
Darwin says: "What's going on?"
Bobert says: "Greetings, organic units."
Bobert says: "Would you be interested in signing up for the science club excursion to watch the solar eclipse in exactly 24 hours?"
Gumball says: "24 hours?"
Darwin says: "24 hours?"
Gumball says: "What exactly happens in a solar eclipse?"
Bobert says: "The sun will be engulfed by the moon and the world will be thrust into complete and unnatural darkness."
Gumball says: "Whoa!"
Gumball says: "And, uh, is this going to be, like, like a bad thing?"
Bobert says: "Well, the Mayans believed that it would signify the end of the world."
Bobert says: "But of course, that was before the advent of science."
Gumball says: "The end of the world!"
Darwin says: "The end of the world!"
Bobert says: "Yes, but obviously it is just primitive nonsense."
Gumball says: "In 24 hours!"
Darwin says: "In 24 hours!"
Bobert says: "Please, let me finish."
Gumball says: "We're doomed!"
Darwin says: "We're doomed!"
Gumball says: "Doomed!"
Darwin says: "Doomed!"
Bobert says: "I'll take that as a yes."
Preparing for The End.
Gumball says: "24 hours?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Oh, this is horrible!"
Gumball says: "All the things I wanted to do in my life, all my plans..."
Gumball says: "ruined!"
Gumball says: "Ruined!"
Darwin says: "You know, I've been thinking."
Darwin says: "24 hours is actually quite a long time."
Gumball says: "Hey, you're right."
Gumball says: "I mean, how many minutes are there in an hour?"
Gumball says: "Like, 60?"
Gumball says: "So, that's like 60 times 24, which is..."
Gumball says: "three billion seconds!"
Darwin says: "That's like ages!"
Gumball says: "We've got to make every second count."
Gumball says: "You know, Darwin, I've never asked you -- but what do you wanna do with your life?"
Gumball says: "What are your hopes and dreams?"
Gumball says: "Who is Darwin Watterson?"
Darwin says: "Well, I guess what makes me happy is helping other people who are less fortunate than ourselves due to circumstances beyond their control."
Gumball goes away bored by Darwin's words.
Darwin says: "Where are you going?"
Gumball says: "Dude, I don't think the end of the world is time to get charitable."
Gumball says: "And besides, you were getting kinda boring."
Gumball says: "I think we'd be better off doing some of the things I wanna do."
[22 says: "42:52."
Gumball says: "Pbbt!"
Gumball says: "Darwin, what are we doing here?"
Darwin says: "Learning hard, so we can get a career, a home, and feed our children in the future."
Gumball says: "Darwin!"
Gumball says: "There is no future!"
Gumball says: "We need to make the most of it right now!"
Gumball says: "Not listening to some baboon drone on about algebra!"
Penny says: "Uh, Gumball, this is biology."
Gumball says: "Oh, who cares?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "It won't matter in 24 hours!"
Gumball says: "Kiss me, Penny."
Lucy Simian says: "Ahem!"
Lucy Simian says: "I’ve got a surprise for you today, children!"
Lucy Simian says: "A surprise test!"
Gumball takes the paper and heads to Miss Simian’s table.
Gumball says: "Well, I got a surprise for you!"
Gumball says: "I’m not gonna do the test because..."
Gumball says: "So come on, everybody, let’s turn our last day on earth into the biggest party ever!"
Darwin says: "Whoo?"
Miss Simian gets wrathful. Gumball grins nervously.
[22 says: "10:12."
[22 says: "School's Hallway."
Gumball says: "Okay, on second thought, spending three hours on detention wasn't the best use of our time."
Gumball says: "I'm gonna be late for my wedding now."
Darwin says: "Wedding?"
Gumball says: "Yes, Darwin."
Gumball says: "My wedding."
Gumball and Penny are getting "married," Banana Joe is the parson, Darwin and Masami are their godparents and Molly and Carmen are the witnesses.
Banana Joe says: "By the power of the banana, it is my duty to ask if there's anyone here who has any reason why Gumball and Penny should not be joined in marriage."
Banana Joe says: "Speak now, or forever hold your peace."
Penny says: "Actually, I've got more than one reason."
Penny says: "Firstly, I'm 12 and so are you."
Penny says: "Secondly, you didn't even propose to me."
Penny says: "You're just trying to marry me in the school corridor."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Hey, guys!"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Happy wedding!"
Penny says: "And finally, this is not a wedding ring."
Penny says: "It's a bagel."
Penny says: "You know what?"
Penny says: "That shouldn't stop you from asking me again in 20 years."
Darwin says: "But you don't have 20 years."
Gumball says: "Hey, wanna get married?"
Carmen is shocked.
The Wattersons'.
The whole family is having lunch, Gumball has a perm, Anais looks at him confused.
Anais says: "Gumball, why do you have a perm?"
Gumball says: "It's just something I've always wanted to do."
Gumball says: "So, Mom, under normal circumstances, how long do you reckon I'm going to live for?"
Nicole says: "Well, your grandfather lived to be 102."
Nicole says: "So I wouldn't worry, sweetie."
Gumball says: "Hmm, that's at least 90 more birthday presents."
Gumball says: "Mom, I'd like to make you an offer you can't refuse."
Gumball says: "I wanna combine all of my birthday presents in one manageable lump present..."
Gumball says: "so can I have a pony after dinner?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Anais laughs.
Gumball says: "What are you laughing at?"
Anais says: "Nothing."
Anais says: "Do you want a tutu with that?"
Anais and Darwin laugh.
Nicole says: "If I get you a pony, you'd get bored of it in a day."
Gumball says: "Not an issue."
Nicole says: "Okay, I'll get you a pony..."
Gumball says: "Thank you!"
Gumball says: "Finally!"
Nicole says: "As soon as your father starts laying golden eggs."
Richard says: "I haven't given up yet!"
Gumball says: "All right."
Gumball says: "I was going to spare you guys, but okay."
Gumball says: "This morning, the TV spoke to me."
Gumball says: "And here's what it said."
Gumball says: ""Dark times are upon us."
Gumball says: "It burns everything it touches to ash."
Gumball says: "" So, basically, there's gonna be the solar eclipse, and..."
Gumball says: "it's gonna be the end of the world."
Anais and Nicole laugh and leave.
Gumball says: "No one believes us."
Richard says: "Have you tried to do something about it?!"
Richard says: "!"
Darwin says: "Well, Gumball got a perm and tried to get married."
Darwin says: "I mostly ate ice cream on a roller coaster."
Richard says: "That's not what I'm talking about."
Richard says: "We need to plan our survival!"
Richard says: ""Apoclatips" or not, the Wattersons will live on!"
Getting the Supplies.
[05 says: "03:55."
Richard says: "Come on, come on!"
Richard says: "We need to go faster!"
Richard is pushing the accelerator but the car doesn't move.
Gumball says: "Uh, Dad, I think you need to take the handbrake off."
Richard says: "Good idea!"
Gumball says: "Dad, you're in reverse."
Richard says: "Correct!"
Richard says: "Let's walk!"
Gumball, Richard and Darwin are running to the supermarket with a shopping cart.
Richard says: "First thing to do in an emergency is to panic and buy everything you can!"
Security Guard says: "Hey, no running in the supermarket."
Richard says: "Okay, let's race walk!"
Richard, Gumball and Darwin are race walking along one of the supermarket corridors.
Darwin says: "This is pretty effective."
Richard says: "Well, it's an Olympic event, you know."
The three of them fill the cart with food.
[04 says: "16:13."
Richard says: "Aah!"
Richard says: "Queue!"
Richard says: "We don't have time for that!"
Gumball says: "Look, Dad, the self-service aisle."
[03 says: "57:21."
Machine says: "Unexpected items in the bagging area."
Tries again.
Machine says: "Please try scanning it more slowly."
Tries again.
Machine says: "Insufficient scanning speed."
Machine says: "Please try scanning faster."
Machine says: "Scan successful."
Richard says: "Yes!"
Machine says: "Item unrecognized."
Richard angrily throws the can at the machine, but it bounces back and hits his head.
Richard says: "Ow!"
Machine says: "Unexpected item in cranium area."
Machine says: "Please rescan."
He does it.
Machine says: "Insufficient scanning speed."
Richard says: "Aaaaah!"
[03 says: "57:23."
Security Guard says: "Hey, come back here!"
Security Guard says: "You didn't pay for that!"
The trio throws the money at him.
The Bunker.
[00 says: "57:23."
Anais says: "Dad, is this really necessary?"
Richard says: "Absolutely."
Richard says: "In every disaster movie I've ever seen, the family survives by hiding in a bunker."
Nicole says: "Richard, that's not a bunker."
Nicole says: "It's a toilet."
Richard says: "Come on, guys."
Richard says: "Think outside the box."
Richard says: "This has got everything we need!"
Richard says: "A toilet."
Richard says: "Uh..."
Gumball says: "I don't think we're all going to fit in there."
Richard says: "We have to!"
The scene changes to the Wattersons inside the "bunker," where they are packed like sardines.
Anais says: "Dad, for the last time, there won't be any apocalypse."
Anais says: "It's just an eclipse."
Richard says: ""Apocalytips", apoc-eclipse."
Richard says: "It's all the same, smarty pants."
Nicole says: "I think this might be easier if we left the TV outside."
The camera goes down, revealing the TV playing a wrestling match, and goes back up.
Richard says: "Nicole, you're describing a world I do not wish to live in."
Richard says: "I'll sacrifice myself."
Nicole says: "Look, honey, why don't you and the boys stay in here and keep acting like complete lunatics, while Anais and I sit outside and watch the eclipse."
Gumball says: "Noooo!"
Darwin says: "Noooo!"
The boys get out the toilet and quickly close the door.
Nicole says: "Boys, what do you think you're doing?"
Gumball says: "We're sacrificing ourselves for your survival!"
Gumball says: "After the apocalypse, you guys will have to repopulate the earth."
Darwin says: "Tell the children of the future of our heroism, our sacrifice!"
Gumball says: "And our perm!"
Gumball says: "We love you!"
Darwin says: "We love you!"
They leave.
Nicole says: "Gumball Watterson, come back here immediately!"
Nicole says: "I'm not spending the afternoon in a toilet!"
The End.
[00 says: "00:33."
Gumball says: "This is it, buddy."
Darwin says: "I'm proud to spend my last moments with you, Gumball."
Gumball says: "Me too."
Gumball says: "Here it comes."
A huge shadow starts to cover the city, everyone who sees it is impressed.
The Moon says: "Duuude, you just got mooned!"
The Sun says: "What is wrong with that guy?"
Gumball and Darwin are shocked because they didn't expect that.
Darwin says: "That was a bit anticlimactic."
Gumball says: "Yeah, but at least we've learned something today..."
Gumball says: "that every moment of our life should be lived to the fullest because it can be very long or very short, my friend."
Darwin says: "That is very true, Gumball."
Darwin says: "So what do you wanna do now?"
Gumball says: "Mmm."
Gumball says: "TV?"
Darwin says: "Yeah."
The scene cuts to the toilet.
Nicole says: "Richard, do something!"
Richard says: "Don't worry, girls!"
Richard says: "I've been in this situation before!"
Richard says: "I'm going to kick the door open!"
Richard tries to kick the door, but they all fall over and toilet water splashes on them.
Nicole says: "EWW!"
Anais says: "EWW!"
Richard says: "Yep, that's exactly what happened last time!"
Episode ends.
