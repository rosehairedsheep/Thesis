Granny Jojo's Arrival.
The episode starts with Richard struggling with some luggage as he goes down the stairs.
Richard says: "We should..."
Richard says: "really get an escalator!"
Nicole says: "I told you, I already asked Santa."
Richard says: "Cool!"
Nicole says: "Now, kids, while we're gone, I want you to do what you Granny Jojo tells you."
Gumball says: "Yes, Mom!"
Anais says: "Yes, Mom!"
Darwin says: "Yes, Mrs."
Darwin says: "Mom!"
Nicole says: "Richard, those go in the trunk."
Richard says: "Huh?"
Richard says: "What does it look like I'm doing?"
Nicole says: "That's the gas tank!"
Gumball, Darwin and Anais laugh.
Nicole says: "Stop laughing at your father, he tries very hard."
Nicole says: "That's the glove box!"
Richard says: "Sorry!"
Gumball, Darwin and Anais laugh again.
Gumball says: "Mom, I've been talking it over with Darwin, and I think I'm old enough not to have Granny Jojo kiss me on the cheek anymore."
Nicole says: "Why don't you want your Granny Jojo to kiss you on the cheek?"
Gumball says: "I'm just not into the whole kissing on the cheek thing."
Nicole says: "But she's your Granny Jojo."
Gumball says: "So?"
Gumball says: "Can't we just..."
Gumball says: "shake hands?"
Nicole says: "She's your grandmother and you are going to let her kiss you on the cheek!"
Nicole says: "Between that and her TV programs that's all she has left these days..."
Darwin says: "I like getting kissed of the cheek."
Darwin says: "It makes me feel special!"
Anais says: "He's right, Gumball, it's not the end of the world."
Gumball says: "Well, if getting kissed on the cheek is so great, how come those two always take off before Granny Jojo arrives?"
Richard struggles with getting the suitcase in the trunk of the car.
Nicole says: "Hurry, Richard, she'll be here any minute!"
Richard says: "I know, I know!"
Nicole says: "Richard, her bus!"
Richard jumps into the trunk and Nicole drives off. Granny Jojo alights from the bus, scene zooms into her applying lipstick.
Anais says: "Granny Jojo!"
Granny Jojo says: "Hello, dear."
Granny Jojo says: "Get my bags, would ya?"
Anais goes to get them.
Darwin says: "Granny Jojo!"
Granny Jojo says: "Hello, walking fish."
Granny Jojo says: "Where's the blue one?"
Gumball miserably approaches her.
Gumball says: "Here I am."
Granny Jojo says: "Say my name."
Anais says: "Come on, Gumball, just get it over with."
Gumball gasps and his pupils shatter.
Granny Jojo says: "Hurry up with those bags, Anais; I don't wanna miss the Sheriff McGruff marathon."
Granny Jojo says: "He's the only man of justice, in a world of deceit."
Darwin says: "Anais?"
Anais says: "Kinda busy here!"
Darwin says: "Something's wrong with Gumball."
Gumball says: "She-she..."
Gumball says: "she kissed me!"
Gumball says: "She kissed me!"
Anais says: "She kisses all of us, get over it!"
Anais says: "Geez, what's in this thing?"
Anais says: "Bowling balls?"
Darwin says: "You okay, buddy?"
Anais says: "Aah, look out!"
Bag falls and hits Gumball, showering him with Granny Jojo's garments. Gumball removes her dentures from his mouth, looks at them, and screams.
Granny Jojo says: "Anais, you be careful with Granny Jojo's bag!"
Anais says: "Yes, Granny Jojo."
Anais says: "Darwin, you get me in trouble, take care of Gumball."
Happy Place.
Darwin says: "Hmm..."
Darwin says: "Hey I know, let's go to your happy place."
Gumball says: "My happy place?"
Darwin says: "Yeah, you know, that special place you go to when you feel bad?"
Gumball says: "I don't have a happy place."

At an ice cream truck, Darwin pays for an ice cream cone and gives it to Gumball.
Darwin says: "Here you go!"
Gumball says: "Thanks!"
He prepares to lick it, but a face appears in it and makes a kissy face. Gumball screams and drops the ice cream.
Darwin says: "Oh, hey look!"
Darwin says: "A butterfly!"
Gumball says: "Whoaaa, pretty..."
Another butterfly lands sideways on Darwin's fin, underneath the other butterfly, making it look like a face. The second butterfly flutters its wings, making it look like the face is talking.
Voice says: "Give Granny Jojo a kiss!"
Gumball screams and shields himself.
