Lunchroom Anger.
The school cafeteria. Gumball is eyeing his lunch with reservation.
Gumball says: "Dude, I think they put so many additives in here, they forgot to add the actual food."
Darwin says: "It's not that bad."
Darwin says: "Don't you think I have a healthy glow?"
His skeleton glows.
Gumball says: "Haha!"
Gumball says: "I think I'll pass."
He lifts his plate and food melts through it. He holds it up and looks through the hole, revealing Clayton at the next table. He looks around and looks back at Clayton. Clayton seems to be glaring and Gumball does the same.
Gumball says: "Hmm!"
Clayton says: "Hmmm!"
Gumball says: "Hmmmm!"
Clayton says: "Hmmmm!"
Gumball says: "Grrr!"
Clayton says: "Hmmm!"
The two growl at each other.
Darwin says: "What's going on here?"
Darwin says: "Stop it!"
Darwin says: "You're gonna get wrinkles!"
Clayton says: "Hmmm!"
Gumball says: "Grrr!"
They won't stop growling.
Darwin says: "Guys!"
Darwin says: "Hey guys!"
Darwin says: "All right."
Darwin says: "You asked for it."
Darwin says: "Say hello to DARKWIN!"
Gumball says: "What was that for?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "To stop you guys from hating on each other."
Gumball says: "What?"
Gumball says: "Eh-he was the one giving me the stink eye!"
Clayton says: "What?"
Clayton says: "I was just trying to read the menu."
Gumball notices the lunch menu on the pillar behind him.
Gumball says: "Oh, dude, I am so sorry."
Clayton says: "No, no."
Clayton says: "It was my fault."
Clayton says: "I apologize."
Darwin says: "Good."
Darwin says: "Now please shake hands."
Gumball and Clayton do so.
Darwin says: "How about a little hug?"
They do so.
Darwin Little kiss?
Gumball says: "I think we're good."
Darwin transforms back into "Darkwin".
Darwin says: "KISS!"
Gumball gives Clayton a kiss.
Tobias' Annoyance to Girls.
The school hallway. Gumball puts his book in his locker, while Tobias hangs around nearby. Carmen passes by.
Gumball says: "Dude, what are you doing?"
Tobias​​ says: "Things are getting pretty serious between me and Carmen."
Gumball says: "You mean she finally decided to take you to court?"
Tobias​​ says: "Pssh, she's just jealous because Masami is clearly into me!"
Gumball says: "Dude, are you okay?"
Gumball says: "You seem to be crying."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​ says: "Who's crying?"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​ says: "I'm not crying."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​ says: "You're the one who cried!"
Gumball says: "What?"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​ says: "You're the one who cried at lunchtime when a certain someone said they used a finger-touching heart-disintegrating move on you."
Gumball says: "Hmmm…."
Darwin says: "Hmmm…."
Gumball says: "Hmm..."
Darwin says: "Hmm..."
Gumball says: ".."
Darwin says: ".."
Gumball says: "Hmmmm..."
Darwin says: "Hmmmm..."
Gumball says: ".."
Darwin says: ".."
Gumball says: "Hmm..."
Darwin says: "Hmm..."
Gumball says: ".."
Darwin says: ".."
Gumball says: "You're just nodding without knowing why, aren't you?"
Darwin says: "Mm-hmm."
Gumball says: "It's Clayton, dude!"
Gumball says: "He's been lying about us!"
Gumball says: "C'mon, let's go speak to him."
In the Schoolyard.
Scene skips to Clayton taking a shower. Gumball barges in.
Gumball says: "Okay!"
Gumball says: "We know you lied about a fight that didn't happen."
Gumball says: "So we're gonna stop you lying for good."
Gumball says: "But I'm not gonna let you speak because if I do, you'll just lie your way out of it."
Gumball says: "Okay, let's go!"
In the next scene, Gumball, Darwin and Clayton are out in the schoolyard.
Darwin says: "Clayton, you just can't keep lying like this."
Darwin says: "It'll ruin the rest of your life."
Darwin says: "Think about your future!"
Gumball says: "What kind of job do you think a liar gets?"
Gumball says: "Tell him Darwin."
Darwin says: "You could be an actor, or a banker, or a lawyer, or even better: the president!"
Gumball says: "Uh, yeah."
Gumball says: "Exactly, so, um, it's pretty bad, okay?"
Gumball says: "And also, what is this "finger-touch heart-disintegrating move" nonsense?"
Clayton says: "What-it's true!"
Clayton says: "I saw it on TV."
Gumball says: "Dude, what kind of world do you live in?"
Lightning strikes the air. Clayton becomes a muscular warrior standing on a hill in what seems to be a post-apocalyptic science-fiction world. He zaps two UFOs with his lazer vision, while Gumball and Darwin dressed like Ancient Egyptian servants approach him.
Gumball says: "Seriously!"
Gumball says: "This is how you see yourself?"
Gumball says: "And this is how you see us?"
Darwin says: "Dude, you're living a lie!"
Gumball says: "And a weird one too."
Lightning strikes the air a second time. The whole thing is inside a thought bubble of Clayton. Gumball bursts the bubble.
Gumball says: "Alright, enough!"
Gumball says: "You need to control yourself, man."
Clayton says: "But how?"
Darwin says: "Why don't you just tell us what you're doing later."
Clayton says: "Well."
Clayton says: "After school, I'm gonna go pirate hunting with the president of the solar system in an underwater theme park where—"
Darwin says: "Okay!"
Darwin says: "Okay."
Darwin says: "Let's just try and take out half the things that aren't true."
Clayton says: "Okay."
Gumball says: "Wow."
Gumball says: "Even your half-truths are full of absolute bunk."
Gumball says: "Okay, let's try and find out what that actually means."
Gumball says: ""Hunting with the president" and a "theme park."
Gumball says: "" You're just gonna go shopping with your dad at the mall, aren't you."
Gumball says: "You know, I think your problem is you deform reality because you're bored."
Gumball says: "And then you forget exactly what the truth was..."
Gumball says: "and you're doing it right now, aren't you?"
Clayton imagines Gumball and Darwin as a monkey dressed as a cowboy riding a large dog.
In the Library.
Both Penny and Teri are reading books. Tobias also pretends to read a book while in between them. He puts down his book and turns to Teri.
Tobias​​​​​ says: "Hey, girl."
He wolf whistles and makes random sounds at her. She gets annoyed, throws her glass of water in his face, and walks away.
Tobias​​​​​ says: "She's loving it."
Penny says: "Really?"
Penny says: "She just threw a glass of water at your face."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "That's because she knows how hot I am."
Penny is tempted to throw her glass of water at Tobias' face, and Tobias opens his mouth. Penny spills the water to the floor instead, smirking. She puts her cup down and resumes reading her book. Tobias sighs, defeated.
The scene switches to Gumball, Darwin, and Clayton. Gumball is holding a trashcan.
Gumball says: "Okay, Clayton, let's try a little exercise."
Gumball says: "We're gonna get all the lies out of you."
Gumball says: "Just give it all to the trashcan."
Gumball says: "It's like ralphing."
Gumball says: "You'll feel better once you get it all out of your system."
Clayton says: "I don't think that's big enough for all my lies."
Darwin says: "And there's holes in that basket."
Darwin says: "It's gonna leak everywhere."
Gumball says: "Dude, it's symboholic."
Darwin says: "Huh?"
Clayton says: "Huh?"
Gumball says: "You 'put your lie in the basket', okay?"
Gumball says: "And it makes you feel better."
Darwin and Clayton still have no clue.
Gumball says: "Okay, whatever."
Gumball says: "Just go for it."
Clayton says: "MY DAD SPENT THIRTY YEARS IN JAIL FOR A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT, NOW HE IS AN AVENGING SUPERHERO!!!"
As Clayton lets all his lies out, Gumball is struggling not to be blown away by the whirlwind.
Gumball says: "Uh, okay."
Gumball says: "Okay STOP!"
Gumball says: "I don't think you understood!"
Gumball says: "Ah!"
Clayton says: "MY MOM IS AN FBI AGENT WHO SAVED THE PRESIDENT TWICE!!!"
Clayton says: "I DIDN'T GO TO MOON ABOARD THE APOLLO ELEVEN BECAUSE I HAD CHICKENPOX THAT DAY!!!"
Clayton says: "I HAVE TRAINED ONE THOUSAND FOWLS WHEN THEY GO TO MIGRATE!!!"
Clayton says: "I'M AN EXPERT OF KARATE, BUT ONLY IN SPACE!!!"
Gumball, books, and papers are blown away, and still struggles to go back to Clayton. On his way, Teri flies into him, and he shrugs her off.
Gumball says: "WHA-HA-HA-HA!"
The Librarian at her desk flies by. Gumball barely avoids some pencils.
Clayton says: "I INVENTED THE GULF, THE WATER AND THE HAMBURGER!!!"
Finally, Gumball grabs a dictionary, and stops Clayton. He points at a word​​​​​​​.
Darwin says: ""Serving as a symbol."
Darwin says: "Significant purely in terms of what is being represented or implied."
Darwin says: "" Ohhhh, you meant symbolic."
Gumball says: "YES!"
Librarian says: "Shhh!"
Gumball says: "What?"
At the Classroom.
Gumball says: "Okay Clayton."
Gumball says: "We need to get to the root of all this lying."
Darwin says: "Why do you think you do this?"
Clayton says: "Well..."
Clayton says: "the thing is—"
Clayton says: "…Well, I guess it's because—"
Darwin says: "Okay go."
Clayton says: "It's because I'm a loser, okay!"
Clayton says: "?!"
Clayton says: "!"
Clayton says: "I don't like the real me, so I lie."
Clayton says: "I prefer to live in a world where-where everyone likes me, and thinks I'm awesome."
Gumball says: "But dude."
Gumball says: "You don't have to lie to make people like you."
Darwin says: "Yeah, you've got lots of awesome qualities."
Clayton says: "I do?"
Clayton says: "Like what?"
Darwin says: "Ha ha."
Darwin says: "Too many to list."
Clayton says: "Try."
Silence.
Gumball says: "Y-you're…you're red!"
Darwin says: "You…have teeth!"
Gumball says: "You…are…you?"
Gumball says: "And that makes you special."
Clayton says: "Thanks dudes!"
Gumball says: "Dude, chill out!"
Gumball says: "No need to get all emotional."
Gumball says: "Haha, just kidding."
Clayton says: "Booop!"
Gumball says: "Booop!"
Clayton says: "Booop!"
Gumball says: "Okay, that's too much now."
Darwin says: "So!"
Darwin says: "Now you can go tell Tobias you lied about the fight."
Tobias' Fate.
Tobias is at the schoolyard, leaning on a bench and thinking he's so attractive. He whistles, and makes flirtatious clicking sounds at Sarah. Sarah is disgusted, and flings some of herself at Tobias. Then Gumball, Darwin and Clayton go to him.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Look at that guys, they're literally throwing themselves at me."
Gumball says: "Dude, please stop."
Gumball says: "You're giving me second-hand shame."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Well, Clayton knows what girls are like."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Don't you, buddy?"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "He once dated sextuplets…at the same time!"
Gumball says: "Hmm."
Gumball says: "Sounds complicated, and repetitive—"
Gumball says: "and a LIE!"
Gumball says: "Isn't that right Clayton?"
Clayton says: "Yeah."
Clayton says: "I've never really had a girlfriend because I'm socially awkward."
Clayton says: "Also, I have glandular problems: my liver starts to smell when I get too close to a girl."
Clayton says: "I-it makes my mouth smell of burnt tires and hummus."
Gumball says: "Okay."
Gumball says: "Good honesty."
Gumball says: "A little too much information, but good nonetheless."
Clayton says: "Also I've got a contagious rash on—"
Gumball says: "WHOA whoa whoa-alright!"
Gumball says: "I'd like to sleep this month, thank you very much."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Wait!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "What about the story about you, and the bear?"
Darwin says: "Lies."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "What about the time you drove a speedboat through the mall?"
Gumball says: "Lies."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "What!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "?"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "What about the finger-touching-heart-disintegrating move?"
Gumball says: "Lies."
Darwin says: "Lies."
Clayton says: "Oh, no."
Clayton says: "Actually, that's true."
Gumball says: "Aw, man."
Gumball says: "You were doing great, and now you bring that stuff back?"
Clayton says: "It's true, though."
Darwin says: "We all know it's not."
Clayton says: "It is!"
Gumball says: "Oh, really?"
Gumball says: "Then please, be our guest."
Gumball says: "Do it."
Gumball says: "Do it right here, right now in front of all of us."
Gumball says: "Do your "special move" on Tobias."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Yeah!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Wait, what?"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "No, no."
Gumball says: "Eh, don't worry."
Gumball says: "You'll be fine because that's all a lie!"
Gumball says: "This guy can't do Kung-Fu."
Gumball says: "He's in a permanent state of sitting."
Clayton says: "Oh, yeah?"
Clayton says: "Okay, you asked for this."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "No, I didn't!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "He did!"
[Clayton does his special move on Tobias says: "he pokes some spots on his body while making sound effects."
Gumball says: "Really?"
Gumball says: "You made the Kung-Fu sound with your mouth?"
Darwin says: "You were doing so well."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Okay, I'm gonna bounce."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I've got gals in different locales!"
As Tobias walks away, he slows down. He drops to his knees, and falls down unmoving. Clayton, Gumball and Darwin all gasp. They all go to his body. After that, they start flailing their arms while screaming hysterically offscreen.
Gumball says: "Wait, we can't leave him like that."
Darwin says: "We got to do something!"
Clayton says: "Like what?"
Gumball says: "ANYTHING!"
Clayton says: "How about CPR?"
Gumball says: "CPR!"
Gumball says: "?"
Gumball says: "You disintegrated his heart, you NUT BURGER!"
Gumball says: "Look at him!"
Gumball says: "He was a young man, with his whole life ahead of him."
Gumball says: "The guy didn't even get a chance to have a girlfriend."
Darwin says: "How does that work?"
Darwin says: "Is it like when chickens lose their heads, and they can still run around?"
Gumball says: "No dude."
Gumball says: "It means he's alive!"
Gumball says: "Oh!"
Darwin says: "Maybe it's 'cause you're standing on his back."
Gumball says: "Oh."
Darwin says: "Just grab him by the armpit."
They grab him by both arms. Both Gumball and Darwin avoid his sweaty armpits.
Gumball says: "Ugh."
Gumball says: "I can see why the guy wears so many sweatbands."
They repeatedly nudge him, carry him, then drop him on the ground.
Darwin says: "Oh!"
Darwin says: "I found a good handhold."
In the Hallway.
Gumball, Darwin and Clayton with Tobias' body sneak through the school hallways. Darwin struggles while dragging Tobias' body, using his teeth as a handhold.
Gumball says: "Come on, stop wasting time!"
Gumball speaks to Clayton.
Gumball says: "Okay!"
Gumball says: "If anyone sees us, we're gonna need a good lie from you."
Clayton says: "You said lying was bad!"
Gumball says: "Yes, I know."
Gumball says: "I did."
Gumball says: "But in special circumstances, when you need to help someone you really care about, it's okay."
Clayton says: "Like who?"
Gumball says: "Me."
Gumball says: "Now come on!"
They run through the hallway. Then they hear Banana Joe whistling.
Gumball says: "Someone's coming!"
Gumball says: "Quick, hide!"
All of them except for Darwin with Tobias' body find places to hide. Gumball hides in a locker.
Darwin says: "What should I do!"
Darwin says: "?"
Gumball says: "Think fast!"
Banana Joe whistles merrily along the corridor. He walks by Darwin and Tobias disguised as a potted plant with Darwin being the pot, and Tobias being the plant. Then he stops whistling as he notices something.
Banana Joe says: "Hmmm."
Banana Joe walks back to Darwin. But he stops near Darwin, and instead reads a note that is posted near where he is.
Banana Joe says: ""Sign up for hall monitor duties."
Caught in the End.
Gumball, Darwin and Clayton with Tobias rush through the hallway once more.
Clayton says: "So what's the plan now?"
Gumball says: "I don't know."
Gumball says: "I'm making it up as I go along."
Gumball says: "We need to work out what we're gonna say if—"
They encounter Carrie. She looks at Tobias with an annoyed expression.
Gumball says: "Hey, what's up girl?"
Darwin moves Tobias' mouth, while Gumball imitates his whistling. Carrie smacks him upside the head with her book, and he hits the wall. She floats away.
Gumball says: "And he went for first place, but she hit it out of the park!"
Darwin says: "That's it!"
Darwin says: "All we gotta do is make it look like he got knocked out by a girl."
Gumball says: "Oh, I love it when you're evil."
Darwin says: "This is me at my most evil."
Gumball says: "Do your evil laugh."
Gumball says: "Okay, let's get on with it."
Gumball and Darwin lean Tobias precariously against a window. Out the window, many girls can be seen.
Gumball says: "Ah, perfect."
Gumball says: "The playground is full of girls."
Darwin says: "How are we gonna get him down there without all the teachers noticing?"
Gumball says: "We need something cunning, something clever."
Gumball says: "Something subtle."
Tobias falls out of the window. Gumball, Darwin and Clayton see him, his fall cushioned by trashbags.
Gumball says: "Yeah."
Gumball says: "Something like that."
Gumball says: "Clayton!"
Gumball says: "You find a girl."
Gumball says: "Any girl."
Gumball says: "We'll meet you down at the playground."
Clayton nods, and they go their ways. Gumball and Darwin carry Tobias' body again, and manipulate him as if he were not unconscious. They move his arms and gesture at other students as if he were greeting them.
Gumball and Darwin go to a distant spot in the playground, and drop Tobias. Clayton heads for them, dragging Jamie along with a stretched arm.
Jamie says: "You are so gonna get it!"
Gumball says: "What did you bring Jamie for?"
Clayton says: "You said any girl."
Darwin says: "Well, at least people will believe she knocked Tobias out."
Tobias starts moving.
Gumball says: "Ah."
Gumball says: "He's waking up!"
Gumball says: "Just get her into position."
Clayton says: "Wait…this is lying."
Clayton says: "You can't just frame Jamie for knocking out Tobias."
Jamie says: "What?!"
Jamie says: "!"
Jamie says: "You were gonna frame me for knocking out  Tobias?"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "What?!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You guys knocked me out, and were gonna frame Jamie?"
Nigel Brown says: "What?!"
Nigel Brown says: "!"
Nigel Brown says: "You knocked out one student, and were gonna blame another?"
Darwin and Gumball suck in their breath and do the finger-touching-heart-disintegrating move on all of them. They stop for a moment and keep continuing the move. Tobias, Clayton, Principal Brown, and Jamie all look confused, and the episode ends.
