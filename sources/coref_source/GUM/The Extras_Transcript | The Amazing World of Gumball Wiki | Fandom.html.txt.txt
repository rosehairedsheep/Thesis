Just Notice Us.
Gumball and Darwin eat in silence.
Gumball says: "So, what's going on today?"
Darwin says: "Nothing much, really."
The Green Bear, who is behind them, slams the table, and sings "Just Notice Us".
Green bear says: "Just notice me!"
All the extras says: "You have ignored us, for way too long."
All the extras says: "Do you think that's really fair?"
All the extras says: "There's stuff that happens to us as well when you're looking elsewhere!"
All the extras says: "So stop being blind."
All the extras says: "This is our time."
All the extras says: "It's your turn to stand behind."
All the extras says: "Don't make a fuss!"
All the extras says: "This one's about us!"
All the extras says: "Just notice uuuusssss!"

Darwin says: "​.."
One of the cardboard-like human spectators goes to his friend amongst the crowd.
Human 1 says: "Hey, dude, I got your popcorn."
He attempts to give it to his friend, but his stiff arms instead make it fall down.
Human 2 says: "Oh, thanks, man!"
Human 2 says: "Do you have my change?"
Human 1 says: "Yeah."
Human 1 says: "It's just here in my pocket."
Human 1 says: "Help yourself."
The other cardboard-like spectator tries to reach into his friend's pocket. But he can't move his arms which are raised upwards.
Human 2 says: "Whatever, man."
Human 2 says: "Just keep it."
Human 1 says: "Cool!"
Human 2 says: "Aw, man, I'm thirsty."
The first spectator hands a drink, only to spill it. His friend sighs.
Human 1 says: "You want another?"
Human 2 says: "Yeah."
Human 1 says: "Sorry."
Human 1 says: "Excuse me."

A rim shot sound effect plays. The doctor sees one of his patients, a drum kit, sneeze.
Bandage Doctor says: "I'll be with you in a minute, sir."
In the Streets.
Ed, the Black Pentagon, and the Black Rectangle walk to the bus stop. Ed sees the bus stop sign, and makes a sing-song intonation noise equivalent to him saying "hi" to it. The bus stop does not respond. This angers Ed, and he rages at it until he hits the sign. The triangle's family recognize it as a bus stop sign, and not a shape person.
Black Rectangle says: "Ed, it's a bus stop."
Construction Men.
George says: "So, you heard about Steve?"

Steve Off-screen Hey, guys!
Gray Construction Man is surprised. Steve comes in with a wig.

Hank says: "Hey, Steve."
Hank says: "Nothing much."
Hank says: "We're just hanging hair-HERE!"
Hank says: "Hey, it's good to see your rug-MUG!"
Hank says: "Mug-mug-mug."
Hank says: "But anyway, how it's going toupee-TODAY?"
Hank says: "Today."
He pretends not to see Steve's hair. Eventually, he just stares at him.
Steve says: "All right, I know you know."
Steve says: "So, what do you think?"
George says: "YOUR HAIR IS HORRIBLE!"
Steve says: "Oh come on, give me a break."
Steve says: "Hank, what do you think?"
Hank continues staring silently.
George says: "IT LOOKS LIKE A WAX TURBAN!"
George says: "IT LOOKS LIKE A STRAWBERRY MOP!"
George says: "IT LOOKS LIKE A PINK FONDUE!"
Steve says: "You guys are real jerks, you know that?"
Hank says: "Aw, come on Steve."
Hank says: "No need to wig out."
Steve says: "Ugh!"
Steve says: "Gentlemen, goodbye!"
With his eyes closed, he turns back. But his wig does not, and covers his closed eyes. Steve walks away, but falls down a ditch.
George says: "But it suits you!"
Eggs and Bacon.
The Exercise Bacon walks along the street.
Exercise Bacon says: "Bacon man."

Exercise Bacon says: "I'm the only one who can commit to vegetarian."
Exercise Bacon says: "To bacon!"
Exercise Bacon says: "'Cause I'm made of bacon!"
Exercise Bacon says: "I'm the bacon man!"
He bumps into both Colin and Felix, cracking them open. The result is an eggs and bacon frowning face. The drum kit guy passes by, and sneezes.

Human 1 says: "Yeah."
Human 1 says: "Sorry."
Human 1 says: "Let me pick it up."
Human 2 says: "No no no."
Human 2 says: "I can do this."

Human 2 says: "AH!"
Human 1 says: "Dude!"
Human 1 says: "Are you alright?"
Human 2 says: "Yeah, everything's cool."

Clipboard Man says: "Wait, guys."
Clipboard Man says: "What're we doing with our lives?"
Lenny says: "He's right!"
Lenny says: "Why are we sticking around with these nooses around our necks, instead of running in the forest naked!"
Lenny says: "I mean running in the forest period!"
Clipboard Man says: "Yeah, what is there to stop us from living the lives we deserve, huh?"
Karen says: "Hey guys, here's your paychecks."
Clipboard Man says: "Oh, yeah."

Senior Citizen's Moment.
Marvin, Louie, Betty, and Donald are sitting in the lawn where they usually are seen. Then Marvin plays music from a nearby radio with his cane. He starts doing some dance moves, his bones cracking. He motions to Donald who moves his mustache. Betty moves her legs, and stands up slowly.
All says: "Ooohhh!"
She sits down, and Louie gets up.
Louie says: "Ugh, cut it out!"
Louie says: "I haven't started yet."
He does some of his own moves, but his bones also creak and crack. Then he kneels, and points to a trashcan.
Louie says: "You just got served, young man."
Marvin says: "Louie, that's a trashcan!"
Marvin says: "Did you take your medicine?"
Louie says: "No one asked for your opinion, magic talking fire hydrant!"

The Story of the Pepperonis.
In the bus stop, Siciliana takes out a cloth, but it is blown away by the wind. She bends to pick it up, and sees someone's hand taking it. Quattro then gives it back to her. The cloth now says "Meet me in the park, 2 PM." Siciliana looks up, and sees that Quattro is gone. The scene cuts to her in the park, sitting on a bench. She looks at the time on her watch, and once she looks back up, Quattro is beside her. They come close together, and hold hands. They have fun together, and bike, have a picnic and watch a movie. Then at the end of the day, they kiss. But their pizza heads stick together, and when they separate their heads, their faces are disfigured. Quattro groans, and the animals nearby get scared, scream, and flee from them.
