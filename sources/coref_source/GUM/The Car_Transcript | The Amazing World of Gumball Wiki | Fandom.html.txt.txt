The marble moves through the machine and eventually makes a bowling ball fly to Gumball's direction.
Gumball says: "Aaaahh!"
The ball's movement is suddenly paused.
Darwin says: "Hey, the card says "No hands"."

Gaylord says: "HUH?!"
Gaylord says: "!"
Gumball says: "More ice, sir?"

Cut to in front of the Robinsons' house. Gaylord sends Gumball and Darwin out of the house and slams the door.
Gumball says: "I'm sure Mr."
Gumball says: "Robinson needs more help."
Darwin says: "Maybe he's too shy to ask."
Gaylord says: "GO AWAY!"
Gumball says: "He hides it well, but, I can feel he needs us."
Gaylord says: "GO AWAAAAY!"
Gumball says: "Now, that is a cry for help."
