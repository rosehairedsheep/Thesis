Going to the Mall.
The Wattersons are driving to the Elmore Mall.
Nicole says: "Oh, come on kids."
Darwin says: "Cause we don't go to school."
Anais and Darwin point their fingers at Gumball, who is still staring outside the window. Anais pokes Gumball in response.
Gumball says: "Sorry, that's all I had."
Nicole says: "Nothing can go wrong."
Richard, Darwin and Anais join in.
Darwin says: "We'll be happy all day long."
Anais says: "We'll be happy all day long."
Richard says: "We'll be happy all day long."
and Nicole says: "We'll be happy all day long."
Darwin says: "And that's the reason why we sing this song."
Anais says: "And that's the reason why we sing this song."
Richard says: "And that's the reason why we sing this song."
and Nicole says: "And that's the reason why we sing this song."
Magic Universal Remote.
The camera cuts to the Elmore Mall parking lot, where a red van is parked.
Van shopkeeper says: "Be careful with this universal remote, it has a power only a fool would not fear."
Van shopkeeper says: "Tell me, for what will you use it?"
Rob​ says: "Oh you know, for TVs, DVD players..."
Rob​ says: "VENGEANCE!"
Van shopkeeper says: "No!"
Van shopkeeper says: "It cannot be used for evil!"
Van shopkeeper says: "Give me that!"
A black cloudy hand reaches out from the van and tries to grab the remote away.
Rob​ says: "Back off, old man!"
The van starts driving forward. Rob presses the arrows on the remote to try to stop the van. Eventually, the van lands on its side.
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "Amazing..."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "!"
Rob points the remote at an ATM and presses eject. The ATM starts spilling money. Rob then points the remote at a fire sprinkler, turning it on. Next he runs to the right side of the parking lot and turns the day into night, then runs to the left side and turns it back into day. Finally, he rewinds back in time to a scene from "The Void." He stands behind Gumball, Darwin and Mr. Small in the Void.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​ says: "Look, children."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​ says: "All the mistakes the world has ever made."
Rob watches his past self trying to get Gumball and Darwin's attention.
Rob​​​ says: "Guys!"
Rob​​​ says: "Guys!"
Rob​​​ says: "Over here!"
Rob watches his past self cling to the van as they leave, and as Janice drives off, Rob watches his past self getting ejected from the Void, leaving him with the disfigured look he now has. He then watches a scene from "The Nobody" where his past self sits on a bench and Gumball and Darwin talk to him.
Gumball says: "There's no bad guy here!"
Gumball says: "You could be our mortal enemy!"
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "You turned me into the villain, Gumball Watterson."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "You left me with this broken body."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "You gave me this ridiculous voice."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "Well now,  And the time has come for you to pay."
Van shopkeeper says: "Same for you buddy."
Van shopkeeper says: "That remote was twelve ninety-nine."
Rob presses a button on the remote, erasing the shopkeeper from existence as he cries out in pain.
The Wattersons says: "There's no space to park, but we're having such a lark that we don't like having to wait until it's dark."
Gumball says: "Break it down!"
Nicole says: "Gumball, honey, could you stop that?"
Gumball says: "What?"
Gumball says: "It's not hurting anyone."
Nicole says: "Yes, well, it's grating and I'm driving."
Nicole says: "Gumball, I said stop."
The car ascends a level in the parking lot. Rob sees the car and smiles.
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "Prepare to suffer!"
Nicole says: "Gumball, I won't ask you again!"
Gumball says: "But I'm just playing with..."
Rob pauses the car.
Gumball says: "..."
Gumball says: "the window."
Gumball says: "I mean, what's the worst that can happen?"
All of the cars drive towards the Wattersons and crash at the same time. The camera zooms out to reveal their car was destroyed on top of the pileup. The Wattersons leave the destroyed car and walk towards the exit.
Nicole says: "I told you to stop playing with that window but you never listen!"
Nicole says: "Talking to you can be like..."
Nicole says: "trying to comb the skin of a kiwi fruit!"
Gumball says: "What?"
Nicole says: "This is gonna cost a fortune!"
Nicole says: "Do you think money grows on trees - well I guess it does 'cause it's made of paper - but that’s not the point!"
Nicole says: "I’m cutting off your allowance, we're broke enough as it is!"
Nicole says: "I'm so angry I can't think of words so I’m just gonna make sounds!"
The others sigh angrily at Gumball, and start walking in as well. Gumball sighs sadly.
Video Game Bargain Bin.
The scene cuts to a Laser Video store. Gumball and Darwin are inside, standing next to a bargain bin.
Gumball says: "Aww, cheer up, dude!"
Gumball says: "Look, we still got two dollars, we can buy a game from here!"
Darwin says: "Everyone knows the bargain bin is a grandma Christmas trap."
Darwin says: "Extreme Tractor Racing."
Darwin says: "The review says: "Here's a cheat code."
Darwin says: "Go left, forward, forward, right, forward, back to the store where you bought it and ask for a refund."
Gumball says: ""If boredom didn't put you into a coma during the show, then this game will finish the job..."
Darwin says: "There's not even a disk inside!"
Darwin says: "It's painted on the box!"
Darwin says: "It's a knockoff!"
Rob appears outside.
Losing Darwin.
Rob​​​​​​​​​ says: "Now, prepare to lose your brother."
He points the remote at Gumball and turns the subtitles on.
Darwin says: "Now we have nothing to play for the whole summer."
Gumball sighs. Subtitles appear in front of him.
Darwin says: ""If we hadn't adopted him, we would have enough money."
Darwin says: "" A-are you serious?!"
Darwin says: "!"
[Gumball notices the subtitles says: ""Isn't it obvious?"
shrugs. The subtitles change to read says: ""Isn't it obvious?"
Darwin says: "What do you mean, "Isn't it obvious?!"
Darwin says: "!"
The subtitles change again to "Are you stupid?".
Gumball says: "Dude, what's wrong with you?!"
Gumball says: "!"
The subtitles change again.
Gumball says: ""Apart from the fact you're a glorified pet that looks like a tiny orange sausage?"
Darwin throws a video game at Gumball.
Gumball says: "Ow!"
Gumball says: "Dude!"
Gumball says: "DUDE!"
Gumball starts running. The subtitles move with him.
The edges of the subtitles hit the doorway and they fall apart, the letters spilling all over the floor. Gumball is knocked backwards.
Gumball says: "What's going on?"
Gumball says: "Darwin!"
Gumball says: "DARWIN!"
He starts running after Darwin.
Gumball says: "Buddy, plea- I didn't mean to upset you!"
Gumball runs towards an escalator.
Gumball says: "Darwin!"
Gumball says: "Darwin!"
Gumball says: "Wha?"
The camera reveals a person with a large, hot dog-shaped head with Darwin-shaped hair.
Hot Dog Guy lookalike​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You thought I was the Hot Dog Guy, right?"
Gumball says: "Uh, no, I thought you were my brother Darwin."
Hot Dog Guy lookalike​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Oh."
Hot Dog Guy lookalike​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "That's a nice change."
Gumball runs down the escalator, where he finds Richard, Nicole and Anais.
Gumball says: "Mom!"
Gumball says: "Dad!"
Nicole says: "Don't worry, sweetie."
Nicole says: "We'll find him."
Richard says: "Of course we understand you when you're making no sense, we're your family!"
Anais says: "I think I mistranslated a word, though."
Anais says: "When you said:  did you really mean "evil magic subtitles?"
Rob hides behind a column aiming the remote at Gumball's parents.
Losing the Family.
Richard says: "Okay, Nicole, here's the plan."
Richard says: "You sort out this mess and I'll get a box of doughnuts and eat away the stress this family keeps dumping on me."
Nicole says: "Honey, I know it's difficult because it's so prominent, but could you please forget your stomach for a minute?"
Richard says: "It's your nagging voice I wish I could forget!"
Nicole says: "I wish I could forget you forgetting our anniversary!"
Richard says: "Sorry, kids, could you just cover your ears for a sec?"
Gumball and Anais cover their ears. Richard and Nicole then have a muffled argument.
Richard says: "Your mother and I have come to an agreement."
Richard says: "I'm getting a doughnut and she's getting a better husband."
Gumball says: "WHAT?!"
Anais says: "WHAT?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Anais says: "!"
Nicole storms off angrily. Richard starts to panic.
Richard says: "Gumball, please look after your sister."
Richard says: "I'm gonna go and de-ruin our lives!"
Anais says: "Dad, wait!"
Gumball says: "Where are you going?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Rob is still hiding behind the column.
Gumball says: "I'm supposed to be looking after you!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You will lose them all."
Rob turns down the brightness until the screen goes completely black.
Gumball says: "Anais, wait!"
Rob turns the brightness back up, revealing Gumball lost in a crowd. Gumball spots Anais and chases her, but Rob turns down the brightness again just as he catches up to his sister.
Gumball says: "Gotcha!"
The screen becomes pitch black; a splat and a scream can be heard. Rob turns the brightness all the way back up, revealing Sarah lying on the ground with Gumball's face on hers. He gets up with ice cream around his mouth and sees Penny. He shakes off the ice cream.
Losing Penny.
Gumball says: "I know- I know there's no way to make this look okay, but I'm gonna try anyway."
Rob peeks from behind a vending machine and changes the language spoken from English to Cantonese.
Gumball says: "佩妮!"
Penny says: "我知你唔會咁背叛我, 但係呢種語言聽起黎好似係我哋拗緊, 所以而家我好沮喪!"
Gumball says: "冇佩妮, 請稍候!"
Rob smiles and presses "Fast Forward" on the remote, speeding the chase up. Penny runs up the escalator and Gumball accidentally pushes her through the glass railing. She screams and, as her drink hits the floor, Rob pauses the scene.
Gumball says: "Huh?"
Gumball runs down the escalator and sees Nicole hugging Hank's arm.
Gumball says: "W-What is this?"
He encounters Anais crying in a crowd.
Gumball says: "What's going on?"
He walks by Penny falling in mid-air.
Rob​​​​​​​​​ says: "I did warn you."
Rob walks towards Richard, who is crying and eating doughnuts.
Gumball says: "You!"
Gumball says: "It was YOU who did all this!"
Gumball says: "My arch-nemesis, Roy!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "No, no, no, my name isn't- MY NAME IS ROB, GOSHDARN IT!"
Gumball says: "Okay, I'm sorry."
Gumball says: "But..."
Gumball says: "how have you done this?"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "With THIS."
Gumball says: "But why?"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Wait up."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "This requires the right mood."
Rob changes the format to a widescreen format and turns down the contrast. Sad music starts to play.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You have only yourself to blame."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You being the hero of all this means that I have to be the villain!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "But I never wanted to be the villain!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I wanted to be the cute sidekick who gets his own plush toy and a spinoff show."
Gumball says: "What are you talking about?"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You really don't get it, do you?"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "So happy to star in your "amazing world."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "" Can't you see that none of this is real?!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "!"
The camera zooms back to reveal more of the mall. Gumball looks around.
Gumball says: "I-I don't understand."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "It doesn't matter."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Once you're out of the picture I can be WHOEVER I WANT!"
Rob presses the AV button. An entrance to the Void appears behind Gumball.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I'm sorry, Gumball Watterson."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "THERE'S NO OTHER WAY!"
Gumball says: "NO!"
Fighting for the Remote.
The remote slips away from their grasp. Rob and Gumball roll over as they fight each other. The two roll over the remote, causing smooth jazz music to play.
Gumball says: "Is it me, or does this music have a whole different vibe to this situation?"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Yeah, hold on."
The two roll back over the remote, turning off the music. They continue fighting. Rob kicks Gumball dangerously close to the Void. He goes to grab the remote, then looks as Gumball runs towards him. Gumball knocks the remote away, causing it to hit a wall and flip over, turning on slow-motion. Rob tries to punch Gumball, but his slow punch does nothing. Gumball attempts the same, but his punch is too slow. Rob tries again, to no avail. They both shrug and look at the remote. Gumball grabs it while Rob tries to hold him back.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Give me that remote you little—"
Gumball presses the power off button at Rob, making him suddenly drop. The speed returns to normal.
Gumball says: "Ha!"
Gumball says: "In your face!"
Gumball says: "Dude?"
Gumball runs to Rob.
Gumball says: "Oh my gosh."
Gumball says: "Rolf?"
Gumball says: "Talk to me, Ralph!"
Gumball says: "Oh, what have I done?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Ron, wake up!"
Gumball says: "Please, Ross, are you okay?"
Gumball says: "Talk to me, Raj!"
Gumball says: "What have I done to you?"
Gumball says: "Oh, Rose—"
Gumball sets the remote down on Rob. It slides off, turning the power back on.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "THAT'S NOT EVEN A MAN'S NAME!"
Gumball screams and falls backwards. Rob grabs the remote, corners Gumball, and changes the format to repeatedly hit his head. Gumball leaps at Rob but fails to grab the remote and is ejected towards the Void. Rob walks up to him.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Time to eject you, once and for all."
He raises the remote at Gumball and presses "Eject" but nothing happens. Rob angrily mashes the button while Gumball gets up.
Gumball says: "The batteries are dead!"
Gumball says: "What now?"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Well, I guess you're gonna do what any hero would do to save the ones he loves."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You're gonna follow the remote."
Rob throws remote into the Void. Gumball walks forward as if to strangle Rob, pauses, faces towards the Void and prepares to jump. He runs but stops quickly after noticing the height.
Gumball says: "That's pretty high..."
Gumball says: "Maybe, just..."
Gumball crouches down and starts climbing down the entrance as Rob watches nonchalantly. Eventually, Gumball is barely hanging on by his fingers.
Gumball says: "Darn it—"
Gumball says: "Aaaaaaah!"
As Gumball falls, Rob walks up and grabs the sides of the entrance.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Goodbye."
To Be Continued.
The credits start to roll on the other side with the music warped. The music fades away as the remote falls. Gumball grabs it and mashes the buttons repeatedly to make it work. Then he flips the remote to reveal that the batteries were out of place.
Gumball says: "What..."
Gumball says: "?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Yes!"
Gumball hits a rock, knocking the remote to the side. He tries to reach it and eventually ends up pressing the "Rewind" button which sends him back through the episode when he fought with Rob, then lost Penny and his family, and finally to the beginning. The episode ends with a "To Be Continued" title card.
