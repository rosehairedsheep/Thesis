At the Schoolyard.
Elmore Junior High schoolyard. Bobert is sitting on the bench, depressed while the other students play kickball.
Suddenly the ball rolls toward Bobert.
Tobias​​ says: "Hey, Bobert!"
Tobias​​ says: "Kick it over!"
Tobias​​ says: "Come on, dude!"
Bobert kicks the ball as he was asked for, but the kick is so powerful that the ball gets to reach the Sun.
Jamie says: "Oh, Bobert!"
Tobias​​ says: "Oh, good job there, robo-dork!"
Alan​​ says: "Hey, take it easy!"
Tobias​​ says: "Why?"
Tobias​​ says: "It’s not like you can hurt his feelings."
Tobias​​ says: "He’s not a real boy."
Banana Joe says: "I’m a banana!"
Bobert sighs again and walks away depressed.
The Learning Curve.
Gumball and Darwin play with dolls at another part of the schoolyard.
Gumball says: "Would you like a cup of tea, Mrs."
Gumball says: "Biggerlocks?"
Darwin says: "Don’t mind if I do, Mrs."
Darwin says: "Pumpernickel."
Gumball says: "And could I interest you in a..."
Gumball says: "Dynamite cupcake?!"
Gumball says: "!"
They toss up their dolls showing an explosion. Then they notice the upset Bobert.
Gumball says: "Hey, Bobert."
Gumball says: "What’s wrong?"
Bobert says: "Oh..."
Bobert says: "Nothing."
Gumball says: "Aw, come on."
Gumball says: "You can tell us."
Gumball says: "We’re friends."
Bobert says: "I just wish I was a real boy."
Gumball says: "Oh!"
Gumball says: "Well, wish no more."
Gumball says: "We’ll help you."
Bobert says: "Really?"
Gumball says: "What’s that?"
Bobert says: "It’s the algorithm for smile."
Gumball says: "Bobert..."
Gumball says: "You’ve got a lot to learn."
Gumball says: "If you want to be real then you have to have proper emotions."
Bobert says: "Define emotions."
Gumball says: "You know..."
Gumball says: "Like feelings and stuff."
Bobert says: "Define feelings."
Gumball says: "You know..."
Gumball says: "When you feel things..."
Gumball says: "Like pain."
Bobert says: "Define pain."
Gumball says: "Okay, look."
Gumball says: "Let me demonstrate."
Gumball says: "Here, Darwin, describe this."
Darwin says: "Ahhhhhhhh!!!"
Gumball says: "How does that feel?"
Darwin says: "Horrible!"
Gumball says: "Hey, yes, yes, of course."
Gumball says: "Can you be more precise?"
Gumball says: "Describe it."
Darwin says: "It feels..."
Darwin says: "Feels..."
Darwin says: "Like this!"
Gumball says: "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!"
They both collapse to the ground still pinching each other and yelling.
Gumball says: "You're making me cry..."
Darwin says: "But when you cry, I cry..."
They stop pinching each other and start crying.
Gumball says: "I’m so sorry!"
Gumball says: "I didn’t mean to hurt you."
Darwin says: "Me, neither."
Darwin says: "I don’t know what I was thinking."
Gumball says: "I love you, buddy!"
Darwin says: "I love you too!"
They hug each other crying.
Gumball says: "And that, Bobert, is emotions."
Gumball says: "Do you understand?"
Bobert says: "Affirmative."
Bobert says: "Emotion equals X over Y plus a square root of a hypotenuse."
Gumball says: "Nerd!"
Gumball says: "Look, man."
Gumball says: "If you wanna be a real boy, you gotta be cooler than that."
Gumball says: "A lot cooler!"
Bobert says: "Commencing temperature adjustment."
Gumball says: "Bobert,  just do as I do."
Gumball walks around like a rapper while a rap-like music sounds.
Gumball says: "Go ahead."
Bobert tries to do the same but he treads very heavily.
Gumball says: "Aw, come on!"
Gumball says: "Give it a bit more..."
Gumball says: "Bounce!"
Gumball says: "Like this!"
The same rap-like music sounds. Gumball tries to show some kind of springy walk.
Darwin says: "Dude, what are you doing?"
Gumball says: "I’m cool walking."
Darwin says: "You look like you are horse-riding nothing."
Gumball and the music stop.
Bobert says: "I concur with the aquatic life form."
Gumball says: "Bobert, if anyone wants to believe you’re a real boy, you need to lose that robot voice."
Bobert says: "May I simulate yours?"
Gumball says: "Excellent choice!"
Bobert says: "Excellent choice!"
Bobert says: "Excellent choice!"
Bobert says: "Hi, my name’s Gumball and my head is so big, I’ve to go in the other room to look at it."
Darwin and Bobert laugh, Gumball examines his head.
Bobert says: "Did you hear?"
Bobert says: "I laughed!"
Bobert says: "I have feelings!"
Bobert says: "I’m a real boy!"
Bobert says: "Thanks!"
Gumball says: "Dude, little tip: Normal people don’t hug for this long."
Bobert says: "Just a little longer..."
At Bobert’s.
Bobert is in the bathroom looking at the mirror.
Bobert says: "I’m a real boy on the inside, but not on the outside."
Mom-Unit says: "Bobert!"
Mom-Unit says: "Time for dinner simulation!"
Bobert says: "Coming, Mom-Unit!"
At the School.
The Hallway.
Masami, Carmen, Molly, and Carrie are walking along the hallway, laughing.
Carmen says: "Gumball’s a dream boy!"
Masami says: "Sensitive, funny, smart..."
Molly says: "And punctual!"
Carrie says: "He’s just perfect."
They walk away, Gumball comes in.
The Cafeteria.
The bell rings.
Gumball says: "Hey!"
Rocky says: "Sorry, dude."
Rocky says: "You know the rules: Only one burger per student."
Gumball says: "So, can I have mine?"
Rocky says: "Here you go, sweetie, still warm."
Penny says: "I’ve never realized how sensitive, funny, smart, and punctual you are, Gumball."
Gumball says: "What?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Penny says: "Come here."
Bobert says: "What?"
Gumball says: "Cupcake?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "CUPCAKE?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "What do you think you are doing?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "When I said you could copy me, I didn’t mean steal my life!"
Bobert says: "But that’s the logical conclusion of this course of action: Observe, assimilate..."
Bobert says: "Replace!"
Gumball says: "What the..."
Gumball says: "Okay!"
Gumball says: "Give me one good reason not to hit you right now!"
Gumball says: "Apart from the fact you are made of metal."
Bobert says: "Because..."
Bobert says: "I am you!"
Gumball says: "What are you talking about?"
Bobert says: "I know everything about you: I know how you walk..."
Bobert says: "Only better."
Gumball says: "But, there’s only room in this town for one Gumball!"
Gumball says: "And that’s me!"
Gumball says: "Let’s see how long you can fool people."
Bobert says: "Challenge accepted!"
Gumball says: "And for the record, I do not look like a clown’s toaster!"
At the Wattersons’.
Nighttime.
Gumball is arriving home.
Nicole says: "I can’t believe this report card!"
Nicole says: "What’s happened to you, Gumball?"
Richard says: "You’re like the same, but better!"
Nicole says: "You’re the best son a family could wish for!"
Everyone says: "We love you, Gumball!"
Everyone hugs "Gumball", the real Gumball screams; Bobert pulls down the blind.
Scenes changes to Gumball going to the shed; Gumball lies on the ground and covers himself with grass because it’s cold, the sprinkler starts working, wetting him; he cries.
The Backyard Battle.
Daytime, "Gumball" and Darwin are going to play Dodge or Dare.
Darwin says: "OK, it’s time to play a game!"
Bobert says: "DODGE OR DARE!"
Darwin says: "DODGE OR DARE!"
Gumball says: "Ah..."
Gumball says: "Gumball, and that’s me!"
Gumball says: "Darwin, do something!"
Darwin says: "But, but..."
Darwin says: "Which one is the real Gumball?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Gumball says: "The one that’s obviously not a robot!"
Darwin says: "Ok!"
Gumball says: "Aw!"
Gumball says: "Why did you do that?"
Darwin says: "You told me to."
Gumball says: "I told you to hit the robot!"
Darwin says: "But that’s exactly what the robot would've said."
Gumball says: "Bobert, this’s gone too far, we need to reboot you!"
Bobert says: "Please, allow me to say one thing before you do."
Gumball says: "Aw, this is going to be sad."
Gumball says: "We’re listening, buddy!"
Richard is sitting on the couch playing a handheld game console.
Nicole says: "Richard, how are the boys doing?"
Richard says: "Oh, I’m playing!"
Nicole says: "Richard, check on them, please."
Richard says: "Oh!"
Gumball and Darwin hide behind the shed.
Gumball says: "OK, listen, you go out and distract him, I’ll sneak up and reboot him."
Darwin says: "No problem!"
Gumball says: "Ha!"
Gumball says: "How do you like that, you psychotic satellite dish?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Bobert morphs into a giant robot and cleans the mud with a wiper that came out of his head, roars; Gumball runs again scared, Bobert start shooting laser beams, Gumball evades them all; finally Bobert shots an enormous beam creating a nuclear-like explosion, but Gumball protects himself with a bin.
Gumball says: "Bobert, you coward!"
Gumball says: "Why don’t you fight me like a man, you..."
Gumball says: "Coward!"
Bobert says: "Initiating hand to hand combat mode."
Gumball says: "He he!"
Gumball says: "That’s more like it."
Gumball says: "Karate Chop!"
Gumball says: "Aw!"
Gumball says: "Is that all you got?"
Bobert says: "There can be only one..."
Gumball says: "I really wish that something that once seemed insignificant would come out and help me right now."
Gumball says: "Ok, something else insignificant."
Bobert says: "It’s too late for that."
Gumball says: "Ha!"
Gumball says: "Game over, it’s reboot time!"
Bobert says: "No, please."
Bobert says: "You made me in your image, we’re two of a kind."
Bobert says: "Think of the things we can do together, Gumball."
Bobert says: "Please, please, don’t reboot me!"
Gumball says: "Hmm, let me think about it..."
Gumball says: "Nooo."
Bobert is starting up.
Darwin says: "Is he alright?"
Bobert says: "Define alright."
Gumball says: "You know what?"
Gumball says: "I think it’s better for everyone if you stay you, and I stay me."
Bobert says: "Affirmative."
Gumball says: "This is even longer than last time."
Darwin says: "C'mon, dude, let’s watch TV!"
Bobert says: "C'mon, dude, let’s watch TV!"
Darwin says: "What was that?"
Bobert says: "Nothing!"
Darwin says: "Oh, Ok!"
Darwin says: "What are you waiting for?"
