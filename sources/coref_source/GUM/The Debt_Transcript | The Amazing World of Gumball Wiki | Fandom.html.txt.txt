On the Street.
Gumball, Darwin and Anais are on the sidewalk in front of the Robinsons' house.
Darwin says: "What do you wanna do today, Gumball?"
Gumball says: "I'm waiting right here for Mom to drive me to "Elmore Senior Talent Show."
Gumball says: ""  Mr."
Gumball says: "Robinson's headlining."
Anais says: "But it doesn't start for another ten hours."
Darwin says: "And you're not invited."
Gumball says: "I don't care!"
Gumball says: "Tonight's the biggest night of Mr."
Gumball says: "Robinson's life and I have to be there!"
Camera changes to the Robinsons' car.
Gaylord says: "Tonight's the night, Margaret."
Gaylord says: "This town is finally going to see the real Gaylord Robinson."
Gaylord says: "Why can't you ever be happy for me?"
Gaylord says: "..."
Camera changes back to Gumball, Darwin and Anais.
Darwin says: "There he is now!"
The Robinsons' car passes by and then goes in reverse, Darwin and Anais get on the sidewalk.
Gumball says: "Save yourselves!"
Gumball says: "It's too late for me!"
Darwin says: "Just get over on the sidewalk, dude."
Gumball says: "Please remember me, guys, so I'll always be alive in your heart."
Gaylord says: "Oh, for crying out loud..."
Gaylord says: "!"
Gumball says: "My whole life is flashing before my eyes!"
Gumball says: "And it's boring!"
Mr. Robinson brakes and parks.
Gumball says: "Huh?"
Gaylord says: "Darn kids."
Gumball jumps on the windscreen.
Gumball says: "You saved my life, Mr."
Gumball says: "Robinson!"
Gaylord says: "I didn't save your life."
Gaylord says: "I just didn't run you over!"
Gaylord says: "NOW GET OUT OF MY WAY!!"
Gumball says: "No way."
Gumball says: "I am not leaving your side until I've saved your life in return."
Gaylord says: "Get off my car!"
Gumball says: "I'll never..."
Gumball says: "ever..."
Gumball says: "leave..."
Gumball says: "your..."
Gumball says: "side!"
Gaylord says: "Don't make me shout at you."
Gaylord says: "I gotta save my voice for tonight."
Gumball is launched to the space because of this.
The Debt.
Gumball says: "Woo!"
The Moon and Saturn turn around.
The Moon says: "What did he say?"
Saturn says: "I don't know."
Saturn says: "Whose turn is it, anyway?"
The Moon says: "Hmm, mine."
The Moon says: "I spy with my lil' eye..."
At the Robinsons'.
Gumball is at the door, lying like a dog.
Gaylord says: "What are you doing here?"
Gumball says: "I'm here to save your life!"
Gaylord says: "Just get away from me, kid."
Gaylord says: "I mean it!"
Hazardous Objects.
Mr. Robinson walks along a corridor, there's a "Slippy Floor" sign.
Gaylord says: "Antiseptic action..."
Gumball says: "Mr."
Gumball says: "Robinson can trip over it."
Gumball says: "There."
Gumball says: "Safely out of the way."
Gaylord says: "Whah, no!"
Gumball says: "Ah!"
Gumball says: "Now's my chance to save him!"
Pantsbully stops Gumball.
Pantsbully says: "Step aside."
Pantsbully says: "I know CPR."
Gaylord says: "Uh?"
Gaylord says: "No, no, no!"
Pantsbully does it twice while Mr. Robinson struggles to get away.
The Coffee Machine.
Mr. Robinson approaches a coffee machine while coughing.
Gaylord says: "I sure hope that hasn't affected my vocal cords."
Gaylord says: "Gumball!"
Gaylord says: "What the..."
Gaylord says: "?"
Mr. Robinson's heart falls out from his mouth.
Gumball says: "So, I saved your life, right?"
Gaylord says: "NO, you darn near ended it!"
Gaylord says: "Now leave me alone!"
At the Tan Salon.
Gumball says: "Uh!"
Gumball says: "Mr."
Gumball says: "Robinson!"
Gaylord says: "What do you think you're doing?!"
Gaylord says: "!"
Gumball says: "I'm bringing you back to life!"
Gaylord says: "But I was alive!"
Gumball says: "Better safe than sorry!"
Gaylord says: "NO!"
Gumball zaps Mr. Robinson with the defibrillator again, lights go out.
At the Robinsons'.
Gumball is at the front door smiling, Mr. Robinson arrives.
Gumball says: "Welcome home, Mr."
Gumball says: "Robinson!"
Gumball says: "I booby-trapped your front door!"
Gaylord says: "Why?"
Gumball says: "To protect you from intruders."
Gumball says: "All you have to do is ring the doorbell, like so..."
Gaylord says: "Wait, why would an intruder ring the—"
Gaylord says: "?"
Gumball rings, a big red ball crashes the front door and hits Mr. Robinson.
Gaylord says: "Ohh..."
Gumball says: "Are you okay?"
Gaylord says: "Listen, kid."
Gaylord says: "This is the most important night of my life."
Gaylord says: "I’m gonna shine..."
Gaylord says: "like a star!"
Gaylord says: "And I don't want you around to ruin it!"
Gumball says: "But I've gotta be there!"
Gumball says: "To save your life!"
Gaylord says: "Just leave me alone, kid."
Gaylord says: "Just leave me alone!"
Gumball sadly goes and sits on the stairs.
Darwin and Anais lean out of the fence.
Anais says: "Poor Gumball..."
Darwin says: "What can we do to help him?"
Anais says: "I got an idea!"
Darwin throws a brick at Gumball.
Gumball says: "Ah!"
Anais says: "I said throw near him, not at him!"
Gumball says: "Ow!"
Gumball says: "Oh, it's so painful."
Gumball says: "Oh man, that hurts."
Gumball says: "Ow, I'll try to walk it off!"
Gumball says: "assenominated..."
Gumball says: "assisanattatted..."
Gumball says: "assasina-ta-ta..."
Anais says: "Assassinated!"
Gumball says: "Mr."
Gumball says: "Robinson!"
Gaylord says: "Well, Margaret, it's nice that you finally decided to show your support for me tonight."
Gaylord says: "What do you mean you're only coming to see me fail?"
Gumball says: "Mr."
Gumball says: "Robinson!"
Gumball says: "He's so brave."
The Talent Show.
Senior Citizen says: "Take it away, Bert!"
The Senior Citizens are on stage, Marvin hurts his back finishing the performance.
Gary says: "Wake up!"
Anais says: "Okay, Darwin, here's the plan  Got it?"
Darwin says: "Got it!"
Darwin says: "We drop these heavy sand bags on to Mr."
Darwin says: "Robinson's head."
Anais says: "No!"
Anais says: "We don't actually hit Mr."
Anais says: "Robinson."
Darwin says: "Hit Mr."
Darwin says: "Robinson."
Darwin says: "Okay, I understand."
Anais says: "Maybe I should try reverse psychology."
Anais says: "Okay, Darwin: the plan is we throw all this stuff at Mr."
Anais says: "Robinson's head."
Darwin says: "That's what I've just said."
Anais says: "Ugh!"
Anais says: "Just do what I do."
Darwin facepalms too, Anais looks at him a little upset.
Gumball says: "Ow!"
The curtain rises.
Mrs. Robinson leaves the seat displeased that her husband has not failed.
Darwin says: "What's he doing?"
Anais says: "I don't know, but it's pretty good."
Anais says: "Now it's our chance to "assassinate" him!"
The bags fall but Mr. Robinson evades them unaware of it with his dance.
Anais says: "Did Gumball see any of that?"
Gumball looks from side to side backwards the stage.
Darwin says: "Maybe, he'll notice the trapdoor."
The trapdoor opens, Mr. Robinson evades it by jumping over as part of the choreography of his dance, Gumball looks out of it for a second and goes down, then it closes, Mr. Robinson's performance continues.
Gumball says: "Show yourself, assassin, and fight like a man!"
Anais says: "Let's try the special effects!"
Gumball says: "Under the seats?"
The stage is full of flares, colour clouds, etc, making Mr. Robinson's performance even better.
Gary says: "Whoa, who is this guy?"
Rocky says: "That's my dad!"
Rocky says: "ROCK ON, DUDE!"
Gaylord says: "I wanna be free..."
Gumball says: "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
The camera changes constantly between Mr. Robinson, Gumball and the lamp.
Gumball falls to the stage before reaching Mr. Robinson but the lamp remains suspended by its wire and stops falling.
Gumball says: "Mr."
Gumball says: "Robinson!"
Gumball says: "Please, come with me now."
Gumball says: "It's not safe here!"
The lamp finally unplugs but Gumball pushes Mr. Robinson away, saving him.
Gaylord says: "BUT THAT DOESN'T EXCUSE YOU FOR RUINING MY PERFORMANCE!"
Everyone applauds Mr. Robinson.
Darwin says: "Hurray!"
Anais says: "Awesome, Mr."
Anais says: "Robinson!"
Rocky says: "Way to go, dad!"
Rocky says: "Bravo!"
Gaylord says: "Thank you!"
Gaylord says: "Thank you!"
Gaylord says: "I love you!"
Gaylord says: "And your love means so much to me..."
Gaylord says: "Thank you, everybody!"
The platform where Darwin and Anais are standing starts going down, finally crushing Mr. Robinson.
Gaylord says: "I love you!"
Gaylord says: "You put me where I'm today!"
Gaylord says: "Thank you so much..."
Darwin says: "Oh, no!"
Darwin says: "I think we squished Mr."
Darwin says: "Robinson!"
Anais says: "Nah, he's okay."
Anais says: "Let's go home."
Anais and Darwin leave happily and the episode ends.
