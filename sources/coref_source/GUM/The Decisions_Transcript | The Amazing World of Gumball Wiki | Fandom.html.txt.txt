Darwin's Decisions.
The episode starts with Gumball and Darwin on the school bus.
Gumball says: "So dude, what do you wanna do after school?"
Gumball says: "TV or go to the mall?"
Darwin says: "I don't know."
Darwin says: "You know how bad I am at making decisions."
Darwin says: "I haven't even decided on a signature!"
Flashback to Miss Simian's classroom. Carmen approaches Darwin, holding a pen and a card.
Carmen says: "Hey, will you sign Teri's birthday card?"
Darwin says: "Uh, sure!"
He signs but is unhappy with the result, so he crosses it out and signs again. He again does not like the result.
Darwin says: "Mmh, no."
He tears up the card, and Carmen gasps in dismay. Flashback ends.
Gumball says: "Making decisions is easy."
Gumball says: "Just use your brain!"
Gumball says: "I mean, what else is it doing?"
Darwin says: "Uhh..."
We see Darwin's brain, frantically checking boxes on a clipboard.
Darwin's brain says: "Breathe in!"
Darwin's brain says: "Breathe out!"
Darwin's brain says: "Breathe in!"
Darwin's brain says: "Breathe out!"
Darwin's brain says: "Breathe in!"
Darwin's brain says: "Breathe out!"
Darwin says: "I think it's busy."
Gumball says: "Well, you can either go on like that, or you can let me make all your decisions for you!"
Darwin says: "Uh..."
Gumball says: "It's decided, then!"
One Week Later.
One week later, the brothers are on the school bus again.
Gumball says: "It's going pretty well, don't you think?"
Darwin says: "Really?"
Darwin says: "You said it would be better for the environment if I chewed on sugar cubes instead of gum!"
Flashback to a group of firefighters attempting to pry a crazed Darwin from his desk. Some students watch frightened.
Darwin says: "I can taste sound!"
Flashback ends.
Gumball says: "What about your date with Carrie?"
Darwin says: "Rather than express my feelings, you said I'd seem more cool and mysterious if I answered every question with a question!"
Flashback to Darwin and Carrie at the cinema. Darwin holds an uneaten hot dog.
Carrie says: "Aren't you gonna eat that?"
Darwin says: "Aren't you?"
Carrie says: "Um, no!"
Carrie says: "You know I can't eat stuff!"
Darwin says: "Do I?"
Carrie says: "Well, you should!"
Carrie says: "I'm your girlfriend!"
Darwin says: "Are you?"
Carrie moves the hot dog and uses it to slap Darwin's face. Flashback ends.
Darwin says: "And the perfume I got Teri for her birthday?"
Darwin says: "I wanted to pack it with bubble wrap, but you said..."
Flashback to Darwin, Masami, Alan, and Bobert celebrating Teri's birthday.
Darwin says: "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you..."
Masami says: "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you..."
Alan​​​​​​ says: "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you..."
Bobert says: "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you..."
Teri opens her gift from Darwin. It is a perfume bottle, packaged in paper shreds. Teri inspects the paper closely and gasps in horror.
Darwin says: "Happy birthday, dear Te..."
Masami says: "Happy birthday, dear Te..."
Alan​​​​​​ says: "Happy birthday, dear Te..."
Bobert says: "Happy birthday, dear Te..."
Darwin says: "ri..."
Masami says: "ri..."
Alan​​​​​​ says: "ri..."
Bobert says: "ri..."
Teri says: "Uncle Brian?"
Flashback ends to everyone exiting the bus.
Gumball says: "Well, I was only trying to help."
Darwin says: "Well, I've had it with your advice, and I'm not gonna listen to you anymore!"
Gumball says: "Uh, dude, I suggest you get off the bus."
Darwin says: "No!"
Gumball says: "Before the doors close."
Darwin says: "Okay, but from now on, I'm gonna get my advice from someone else!"
Mentor-Seeking.
In the cafeteria, Darwin tries to find his personal mentor.
Darwin says: "Hmm..."
Darwin says: "who to choose?"
Tobias​​ says: "or you."
Masami says: "Tobias, you don't have enough respect for girls!"
Tobias​​ says: "Ha, sure I do!"
Masami says: "You're literally leaning on Carmen."
Upon realization, Tobias screams in pain and jerks his arm away. He pulls one of Carmen's spines out of his arm.
Darwin says: "Mmm, too slimy."
Darwin says: "What about Joe?"
Banana Joe says: "Hey, everybody!"
Banana Joe says: "Watch this!"
He throws his peel into the ground and, with a running start, slides on it like a sled. He crashes into the trash can and falls in. Rocky notices his peel on the ground and throws it in. He empties the trash and replaces the trashcan liner.
Banana Joe says: "Ta-da..."
Darwin says: "Nah, too..."
Darwin says: "weird."
Gregor says: "Hey!"
Gregor says: "Want to check out the new milkshake place after school?"
Gregor says: "You know your boy Gregor is all about his milkshakes!"
Darwin says: "Wait!"
[Suddenly he sees the perfect mentor says: "Alan."
Darwin says: "Of course!"
Darwin says: "Alan!"
Alan is sitting with a group of daycare kids.
Little Timmy says: "Why can't I eat chocolates instead of vegetables?"
Alan​​ says: "Because, sweet child, chocolate is fun for a treat!"
Alan​​ says: "But vegetables are the..."
Alan​​ says: "Delicious!"
Peggy says: "If you were talking while you were eating, then where did the—"
Darwin says: "Hi, Alan!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​ says: "How can I help, Darwin?"
Darwin says: "Alan, you seem to have it all figured out."
Darwin says: "Could you help me make the right decisions?"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Of course!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I'd be delighted to!"
Peggy says: "Isn't fruit one of your five-a-day too?"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Anyway, Darwin, let's get out there and start making some better decisions!"
Alan's Influences.
A few days later, in the hall. Darwin is walking with Carrie.
Carrie says: "It was so refreshing, you just straight-up apologized to me."
Alan passes by and winks at Darwin. He winks back, with a thumbs-up.
Carrie says: "Normally, you'd try some kind of harebrained scheme to win my heart back."
Carrie says: "You're definitely making better decisions."
They pass by Leslie and Carmen, who both smile at him.
Carrie says: "And I think everyone's starting to notice—"
The scene cuts to Principal Brown evaluating Darwin and Alan's science fair project.
Nigel Brown says: "Uranus, and Neptune."
Nigel Brown says: "Well, that's the best solar system diorama I've seen all year."
Nigel Brown says: "Well done, Darwin."
Nigel Brown says: "You boys remind me of myself when I was a—"
The scene cuts to the hexagon lady with her dog, who was just saved by Darwin and Alan.
Hexagon lady says: "Disgusting vile sewer rat!"
Hexagon lady says: "But little Wilfred chases anything."
Hexagon lady says: "I'm just glad you saved him."
Darwin says: "Thanks, Mrs."
Darwin says: "Lady!"
Darwin says: "Alan advised me to call the relevant authorities rather than go into the drain myself!"
Darwin says: "He's the real hero!"
Hexagon lady says: "I never said you were a hero."
Hexagon lady says: "But still, I'm very grateful."
Hexagon lady says: "All I can say to you is—"
Cut to the Donut Cop arresting Sal Left Thumb.
Donut Sheriff says: "Eat it, greaseball!"
Donut Sheriff says: "Son, we couldn't have done it without you."
Darwin says: "Thank you, officer!"
Darwin says: "Rather than trying to take on the criminal myself with an elaborate scheme and accidentally joining his gang in the process, Alan told me to just call you!"
Donut Sheriff says: "I didn't ask, but I'm sure the mayor will invite you to City Hall so you can both be—"
Cut to Teri holding a meringue.
Teri says: "Whipped..."
Teri says: "to perfection!"
Teri says: "Thank you, Darwin!"
Teri says: "This is the tastiest meringue I've ever had!"
She hugs him, causing him to stretch like a balloon.
Teri says: "You okay?"
Teri says: "You don't seem yourself."
Darwin says: "In fact, I've never been better!"
Darwin says: "See you later!"
He and Alan float over to Gumball.
Gumball says: "Well, looky who's made a decision about who's going to make their decisions!"
Darwin says: "Hello, Gumball!"
Darwin says: "Won't you join us?"
Gumball says: "Really?"
Gumball says: "Join Head Zeppelin and his airhead puppet?"
Darwin says: "What do you mean?"
Gumball says: "Come on, look at you!"
Gumball says: "You're turning into him!"
Gumball says: "And I don't even wanna know how you got inflated in the first place."
Darwin says: "But I'm making good decisions now!"
Gumball says: "No, dude!"
Gumball says: "You're just doing whatever he says!"
Darwin says: "That's not true!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​ says: "I'm making all of my own decisions."
Darwin says: "I'm making all of my own decisions!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "All on my own, without any help from anyone else."
Darwin says: "All on my own, without—"
Gumball says: "Huh."
Gumball says: "That went pretty well, don't you think?"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Uh, no!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "He ran off crying!"
Gumball says: "Well, like I always say, you gotta break them down to build 'em back up again."
Gumball says: "Then, you break 'em down again, and then, you build 'em up again!"
Gumball says: "Then, down again, then up again, then it's down, down, up, up, down, up, then all the way up, and then a little bit down and then you're done!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "That sound like a cheat code for being a terrible friend."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Come on."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "We better go find him!"
Gumball says: "Oh, you would go that way, wouldn't you?"
Gumball walks off the other way but collides with Teri. Her meringue flies into the air and splatters on them both.
Gumball says: "Ugh!"
Gumball says: "Darn it."
Gumball says: "They are good meringues, though."
Mall Brawl.
Darwin is at the mall.
Darwin says: "Okay."
Darwin says: "I can do this."
Darwin says: "Just make a decision to do something, and stick to it!"
Jared waves a Joyful Burger flyer in his face.
Jared says: "Hey, kid!"
Jared says: "Why not go pick up a burger?"
Jared says: "It's half price with this flyer!"
Darwin says: "Yes."
Darwin says: "Yes I will!"
Darwin says: "There!"
Darwin says: "I made a decision to do exactly..."
Darwin says: "what that guy..."
Darwin says: "told me."
Darwin says: "Ugh."
He gets in line for the burger stand and hands his flyer to Larry.
Darwin says: "One burger, please."
Larry says: "Sure!"
Larry says: "Which one?"
Darwin says: "Uhh..."
Muriel, who is in line behind Darwin, whispers to him.
Muriel says: "Get the slaw crime."
Muriel says: "It's on promotion!"
Darwin says: "Uh, okay."
Darwin says: "One slaw crime, please."
Larry says: "Excellent choice, sir!"
Larry says: "Oh, one more thing—"
Larry says: "would you like to go large?"
Larry's words echo inside Darwin's head. He imagines himself falling through a void.
Larry says: "Hello?"
Larry says: "Hello?"
In reality, Darwin is just writhing on the ground with his eyes closed.
Larry says: "Hello?"
Larry says: "Kid, which is it?"
Darwin says: "Uhh..."
Pantsbully says: "Oh, c'mon, kid!"
Pantsbully says: "Just go large!"
Gary says: "No!"
Gary says: "Go small!"
Harold​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I say go medium!"
Harold stamps his foot, causing Jeff to ram into Muriel.
Muriel says: "Hey, don't push!"
She pushes Jeff back. Everyone in line falls over, causing Marvin to knock over three call boxes. One of them falls on Banana Barbara, who shoots out of her peel, landing in Coach's mouth, causing her to get stuck at the bottom of the escalator. Darwin watches as a huge brawl breaks loose throughout the entire mall. Gumball and Alan find him.
Gumball says: "There he is!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​ says: "He's in trouble!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Quick, Darwin!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Get to the exit!"
Gumball says: "No, Darwin, stay!"
Gumball says: "Establish dominance now!"
Gumball says: "The riot can smell fear!"
A police car pulls over. The Donut Cop assesses the scene for a few frantic seconds, then padlocks the doors.
French Fry Cop says: "You're locking the doors, Chief?"
Donut Sheriff says: "Best way to deal with rioters?"
Donut Sheriff says: "Seal them in, and let them get it all out of their system."
Back in the mall, Hank and George watch Felicity and Billy get into a tussle with the drum kit guy.
Hank says: "Hey, look!"
Hank says: "Those people down there are jostling!"
George says: "Kinda looks to me like they're fighting."
Hank says: "I said they're jostling!"
George says: "Fighting!"
Hank says: "Jostling!"
George says: "Fighting!"
He slaps Hank into Tony, who falls on Siciliana. Her cheese and a pepperoni slice get stuck on his face. He takes the pepperoni off and eats it.
Tony says: "Mm-hm!"
Tony says: "Pepperoni!"
Quattro says: "Why, you!"
He punches Tony in the face, causing him to fly across the room and slam into the piping. The pipe breaks, and water starts jetting out and filling the entire room.
Darwin says: "Oh no!"
Darwin says: "What do I do?"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Climb up to higher ground!"
Gumball says: "No, sing a song!"
Gumball says: "That usually seems to wrap things up!"
Gumball says: "Wintertime is a time for bells—"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "That's not even a song about the situation!"
A boat with three sailors inside pulls up to Darwin.
Sailor says: "Get in, kid!"
Sailor says: "There's room for one more!"
Sailor says: "We have a spare life preserver!"
Sailor says: "In exactly your size!"
Banana Bob passes by, using a burning arcade game as a raft.
Banana Bob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "No!"
Banana Bob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Hop on this arcade machine!"
Banana Bob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "It's on fire!"
Banana Bob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "And, it's sinking!"
Darwin says: "Uhh..."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Really?!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Obviously, take the one that's an actual boat!"
Gumball says: "But what if it gets boring on there?"
Gumball says: "Get on the arcade machine, dude!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I think it's time we do something!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "The water's getting higher!"
Gumball says: "You know what?"
Gumball says: "I'm tired of all your advice."
Gumball says: "Why don't you just tie a knot in it?"
Alan looks at the pipe and has an idea.
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Of course!"
Gumball says: "That is not what I meant!"
He attaches his knot to the pipe, collecting all the water. He rapidly starts inflating and sagging due to all the weight.
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "There's too much water!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I can't hold it all in!"
Gumball says: "I know!"
Gumball says: "If I run into you hard enough, it'll force the water back up into the pipe!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I'm not sure that's a good id—"
Gumball runs into Alan but only bounces off of him, hitting the wall and passing out. Alan, who is still inflating, is about to entrap him.
Alan​​ says: "Gumball!"
Alan​​ says: "Wake up!"
Alan​​ says: "I can't stop!"
Gumball wakes up and realizes his foot is stuck under Alan. Neither of them are able to move.
Gumball says: "Help!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Help!"
Gumball says: "Help!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Help!"
Darwin, still in the water, hears them shouting for help.
Darwin says: "Gumball!"
Darwin says: "I've got to do something!"
Darwin says: "Larry!"
Darwin says: "How do I stop the water?"
Larry says: "There's a crank in the basement!"
Darwin says: "Thanks!"
Larry says: "Wait a minute, do you want to go large or not?!"
Larry says: "!"
Darwin Hatches a Plan.
Darwin swims down to the basement, but gets stuck at two diverging hallways. Meanwhile, Alan can barely hold any more water.
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Sorry, Gumball, I thought this would make things better!"
Gumball says: "Well, you did always have an inflated opinion of yourself."
Back in the basement, Darwin goes left but stops.
Darwin says: "Dead end."
He continues right and finds the main water cut off valve, which is locked. He thinks for a moment, and then sees an axe in a glass box reading "BREAK IN CASE OF EMERGENCY." Darwin smashes the entire box against the lock, eventually breaking it and going inside. He starts turning the valve, but it gets stuck. While Gumball gets completely covered by Alan, after some struggle, Darwin gets the valve to start turning, shutting off the water .
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "It..."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "it stopped!"
Gumball says: "Yay."
Darwin finds them, reaches inside Alan, and pulls out Gumball.
Gumball says: "Huh, ever thought about being a vet?"
Darwin says: "No, a plumber!"
Darwin says: "I turned off the water supply, and it was all my idea!"
Gumball says: "Nice work, buddy."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "But the mall is still flooded!"
Gumball says: "Okay, well I think we should soak it up with as much rice and dehydrated fruit as you can find."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "No!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You should find a call box, and alert the relevant authorities!"
Gumball says: "Ugh."
Gumball says: "You would say that, you—"
Gumball says: "Hey, where's Darwin?"
Darwin swims to the bottom of the mall fountain, finds the drain, and opens it. All the water slowly drains out, making a loud noise. The noise is then revealed to have come from Leonard, slurping a soda.
Leonard Daniels says: "What?"
Darwin says: "I just pulled out the plug!"
Gumball says: "Yeah, I guess that would work too."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "But what about me?"
Gumball says: "Let me do this one."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "No, no, no, no, no—"
All the water shoots out, breaking through the doors and drenching the two cops outside.
French Fry Cop says: "Chief, I can't feel my legs!"
Donut Sheriff says: "And I feel like I've been dunked!"
Three Chocolates, Please!
Some time later, Gumball, Darwin, and Alan walk to the ice cream truck. Alan is completely stretched out.
Gumball says: "At least Darwin is making his own decisions now."
Alan​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Yeah, and I'm sure I'll be able to work off all the loose skin in no time!"
Larry says: "What can I get you boys?"
Gumball says: "Three ice creams with chocolate sauce, please."
Darwin says: "Wait!"
Darwin says: "Make that two chocolate, and one with strawberry."
Larry says: "Oh, we're out of strawberry!"
Darwin says: "Whatever."
Darwin says: "Three chocolate, then."
The episode ends.
