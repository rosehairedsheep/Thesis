Cheerleading Fail.
At the Elmore Stadium, Gumball and Darwin are watching the cheerleaders practice.
Cheerleaders says: "Go, Elmore, Go!"
Cheerleaders says: "Go, Elmore, Go!"
Gumball says: "Woo!"
Gumball says: "Ready!"
Gumball says: "Yeah!"
Gumball says: "Dude, that sounds like a cow on anesthetics."
Darwin says: "It's not that I'm not supportive but..."
Darwin says: "they're kind of a train wreck..."
Darwin says: "that like, a truck crashed into..."
Darwin says: "and then the whole thing sunk into a lake..."
Darwin says: "and managed to catch fire..."
Darwin says: "and exploded."
Cheerleaders says: "Go, Elmore, Go!"
The cheerleaders fall and injure themselves.
Teri gets shredded by Carmen.
In the Schoolyard.
The school bell rings. Gumball and Darwin are talking in the schoolyard.
Gumball says: "Yeah, I know what you mean."
Gumball says: "They were clearly missing something."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "You notice too?"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Stuff goes missing all the time in this town."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "Everyone pretends it doesn't happen, but I say it's a conspiracy."
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "That's why I've got my hat on!"
Mister Small​​​​​ says: "TO STOP THEM ERASING MY MEMORY AND FORGETTING WHAT WAS TAKEN FROM ME!"
Gumball says: "Oh, hehe so it's both fashionable, and useful."
Darwin says: "What have you lost, Mister Small?"
Gumball says: "His marbles?"
Mister Small​​​​ says: "No."
Mister Small​​​​ says: "The love of my life, Janice."
Darwin says: "Mr."
Darwin says: "Small."
Darwin says: "With all due respect, how do you know that Janice didn't just leave you?"
He walks away.
Mister Small​​​​ says: "Look for what's not there, look for what doesn't make sense."
Gumball says: "I think we're looking at it right now."
Mr. Small walks away again. Gumball and Darwin sigh.
Mister Small​​​​ says: "And make a hat!!"
In the Hallway.
Darwin puts a book in his locker.
Darwin says: "You know, I kinda feel something's missing too."
Gumball says: "Your fingers?"
Darwin says: "No."
Gumball says: "Hair?"
Darwin says: "No."
Gumball says: "Some kind of a torso?"
Darwin says: "No, think about it."
Darwin says: "Something that used to be here at school, but now it's gone."
Darwin says: "Look at this!"
He gestures to the locker numbers. There is 115 and 117, but-.
Darwin says: "There's no 116!"
Darwin says: "There's a locker missing."
He traces his fin along the line where the locker seems to have folded on itself. Both Gumball and Darwin see that the school's section aligned with the locker also folded on itself, with a door being reduced to half its size on the opposite side. The door opens, and the cheerleaders come out. They don't seem aware of this, even when Sarah's head gets lodged in the doorway.
Gumball says: "Okay."
Gumball says: "Even I can tell something's missing here."
Darwin says: "Maybe it's not something."
Gumball says: "Somewhere!"
Gumball says: "?"
Darwin says: "No."
Gumball says: "Somehow?"
Darwin says: "No."
Gumball says: "Somewhat?"
Darwin says: "No."
Gumball says: "Sombrero?"
Darwin says: "No."
Darwin says: "Someone."
Gumball says: "Yeah, well."
Investigations.
Darwin says: "Let's look at the yearbook."
Gumball says: "Stop!"
Gumball says: "Look."
He points to a photo of a serious Principal Brown, showing only his upper body. Under the photo, someone had drawn a skirt, and slender lady legs to match Principal Brown's upper body. Gumball snickers, but is stopped with Darwin's glare.
Gumball says: "I mean- STOP!"
Gumball says: "Look."
This time, he points to a photo of the cheerleaders in a pyramid formation. But one of the cheerleaders holding up the pyramid is missing.
Gumball says: "It's like someone was… erased."
Darwin says: "Okay, concentrate."
Darwin says: "It's gotta be someone we know."
Gumball says: "Okay, okay."
Gumball tries his best to remember. Darwin's voice is heard, and Gumball opens his eyes to find photos floating around in his face.
Darwin says: "Do do do do- Something's missing Do do do do-  Do do do do-who can it be?"
Darwin continues rotating photos in from of Gumball's face.
Gumball says: "Are you do-do-do-done here?"
Darwin says: "Well what do you do when you need to remember something?"
Gumball says: "The same thing I do when the TV loses signal."
Gumball says: "It's Molly..."
Back in the Schoolyard.
Many students are gathered around Gumball.
Gumball says: "So you're telling me that in a class full of our friends, who went to school with her your whole life, not one of you remembers Molly?"
Everyone mutters, not knowing who Molly is.
Banana Joe says: "Wait, did you say Molly?"
Gumball says: "Yes!"
Banana Joe says: "Nah, don't remember her."
Alan​​​ says: "Maybe if you gave us some more details about her, we could all try, and remember together!"
Gumball says: "More details?"
Gumball says: "More details!"
Gumball says: "?"
Gumball says: "WHAT KIND OF FRIENDS ARE YOU?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "SHE WAS A GIRL!"
Gumball says: "SHE WAS JUST A GIRL!"
Gumball says: "And that girl's name was Molly!"
Carrie says: "You don't remember her either, do you?"
Gumball says: "NO!"
Gumball says: "YOU'RE RIGHT!"
Gumball says: "I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHO SHE IS!"
Gumball says: "BUT NOW THAT I HIT THIS VOLUME, I CAN'T REALLY STEER AWAY BACK DOWN."
Gumball says: "SO I'M JUST GONNA WALK AWAY  SHOUTING."
Mr. Small's Office.
Gumball and Darwin enter.
Darwin says: "Mr."
Darwin says: "Small!"
Darwin says: "You're not actually crazy!"
Mr. Small, almost naked except for a loin cloth, is meditating with a tin foil hat. Eyes are drawn on his torso, and the top of his head is colored yellow with a vertical red stripe.
Gumball says: "Or not completely, anyway."
Darwin says: "Your conspiracy theory."
Darwin says: "It's true!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "I knew it!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "Red heads are the descendants of an alien race."
Gumball says: "No, not that one."
Gumball says: "The people disappearing, remember?"
Gumball says: "We need your help to find our friend, Molly."
Darwin says: "And your Janice."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "Right."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "I foresaw that you would come to me, so I made these."
Darwin says: "How did you know?"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "The six nipple-eyes see the past, the present, and the future."
Gumball says: "…  Six?"
Darwin nods.
Back in the Hallway.
Mr. Small investigates the gap where the missing locker used to be.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "Hmm…yeah, I see..."
Gumball says: "So, what do you think?"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "Oh, You're right."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "The locker's gone."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "But there's something left here."
Gumball says: "Well I don't see anything."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "Look closer."
Gumball steps forward to gap.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "Closer."
Gumball steps forward to gap.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "Closer."
Gumball bumps into gap.
Darwin says: "I think that might be a little too close."
Gumball says: "Quick, Mr."
Gumball says: "Small."
Gumball says: "I need a pin!"
Mr. Small takes a pin from his head, and his head fluff puffs up. With the hairpin, Gumball pulls out a photograph.
Gumball says: "♪ Clue!"
Darwin says: "♪ Clue!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "♪ Clue!"
Darwin looks at it, and sees himself, and Gumball with Molly and her treehouse.
Darwin says: "Oh yeah!"
Darwin says: "That's Molly."
Gumball says: "We were definitely friends!"
Darwin says: "How could we not remember?"
Darwin says: "And her treehouse."
Gumball says: "Yes, yes, that's it!"
Gumball says: "All we have to do now is build a treehouse just like hers, and she'll come right to us!"
Darwin says: "Or we can try, and find hers since that's probably where she is."
Gumball says: "Or, we could try, and find hers because that's probably where she is!"
Darwin says: "Oh my gosh!"
Darwin says: "That's a much better idea."
The Discovery of a Lifetime.
Cut to the three walking by the streets.
Gumball says: "Mr."
Gumball says: "Small, do you remember Molly?"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Of course I remember her."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Thanks to the hat."
Darwin says: "What was she like?"
Darwin says: "We've completely forgotten about her."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Well, let's see."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "She was boring, and uh…ooh…eh…no, that's it."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "She was just boring."
Darwin says: "What do you think happened to her?"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Well kids, Elmore is not a normal place."
A yellow wig walking its dog passes by.
Dog says: "Oh, hello!"
A yellow wig Barks.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "It's a pretty weird world, and sometimes it makes mistakes."
Darwin says: "Do you think the world thought Molly was a mistake?"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Yeah."
Darwin says: "Mr."
Darwin says: "Small!"
Darwin says: "Are you okay?"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Of course!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Pain is just information that the mind can master."
Gumball says: "So it didn't hurt bad?"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "No, I feel great."
Darwin says: "Look!"
Darwin says: "Another clue."
Darwin says: "Just like at the locker."
The street is also folded on itself. Gumball takes out the photo from earlier, and compares it to the area.
Gumball says: "But her whole house is gone."
Gumball says: "It's like the world folded in on itself again."
It is revealed that the area were Molly's house has disappeared, sky and all, is flat like a wall.
Gumball says: "What is this?"
Gumball says: "What's going on here?"
The gap were the world folded in itself sucks in the photograph of Molly with the Wattersons.
Darwin says: "What?"
Gumball's face is suck into the gap, and his head is eventually engulfed in it.
Darwin says: "I got you."
Darwin says: "I got you!"
Darwin pulls him out. Gumball's face is stretched.
Darwin says: "Oh my gosh, your face!"
Gumball says: "If you think that's weird, you should see what's in there."
They prepare to pull the gap apart.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Are you sure you wanna do this?"
Darwin says: "We have to!"
Darwin says: "We can't forget about our friends."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Okay."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "On three."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Two."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "One!"
They pry the gap's sides apart, revealing the Void and all its contents.
Gumball says: "On second thought, maybe we should just forget about Molly and Janice and stuff."
Gumball says: "I don't remember Molly anyway."
Darwin pushes Gumball into the Void.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Darwin!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "It wasn't very nice of you to push your brother in such a way."
Blackout.
Into the Void.
The three land on a piece of floating.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "Look, children."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "All the mistakes the world has ever made."
He gestures at some floating objects.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "Jorts, Laser Disc, the Mullet."
Darwin says: "Guys!"
Darwin says: "It's Molly's treehouse."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "Okay!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "You get her, and I'll find Janice."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "Whoa!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "Oh yeah!"
Mr. Small hops his way around on pieces of floating land, and other objects.
Darwin says: "Mr."
Darwin says: "Small!"
Darwin says: "Wait!"
He lands on a rock cloud while Gumball bounces against some objects, Rob is seen.
Gumball says: "Oof!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "Let's just say I'm used to feeling spaced out."
Gumball says: "Okay."
Gumball says: "How do we get to the treehouse?"
Darwin says: "Let's use this highly toxic hairspray from the eighties!"
Cut to Gumball and Darwin flying through the void, using the hairspray to navigate. Darwin's spray goes behind him, to a coughing Gumball, and makes the latter's hair grow. They then climb the treehouse.
Gumball says: "Molly!"
Gumball says: "Molly?"
Molly, in the middle of pouring her tea, is frozen in the treehouse like a statue.
Darwin says: "What's wrong with her?"
Gumball says: "Molly?"
Molly says: "Oh, hi!"
Darwin says: "Oh, you're okay."
Gumball says: "We were so worried!"
Darwin says: "When we…finally remembered you."
Gumball says: "After a year."
Molly says: "What do you mean, worried?"
Molly says: "I saw you yesterday."
Darwin says: "Are dinosaur years like dog years?"
Darwin says: "Like you saw us yesterday, but it was actually a year ago."
Molly says: "That wasn't a year ago."
Molly says: "Right?"
No response.
Molly says: "What happened to me?"
Gumball says: "It's because you're boring."
Molly says: "I'm not boring, I do lots of cool stuff!"
Molly says: "I collect pencils."
Gumball and Darwin are sleeping while standing up. They suddenly jolt awake.
Darwin says: "What were we doing?"
Gumball says: "We were getting out of here."
Escaping the Void.
Gumball, Darwin, and Molly are now outside the treehouse.
Gumball says: "Okay Molly, we just have to get back through that big hole, and we're home."
Molly says: "You mean that hole over there, the one that's shrinking, and almost closed?"
Gumball says: "Yes, exactly."
Gumball says: "The one that's- OH MY GOSH IT'S CLOSING!"
They hop their way to the hole.
Gumball says: "Quick!"
Gumball says: "The world doesn't want you to escape!"
He runs across a piece of land, while Molly and Darwin hop.
Gumball says: "What are you guys doing!"
Gumball says: "?"
Darwin says: "Well, I dunno."
Darwin says: "I thought using these would be a good idea."
Gumball says: "Dude, everything here is a bad idea!"
Gumball says: "Do I have to spell it out for you?"
A paperclip appears in front of them.
Paperclip says: "Hey!"
Paperclip says: "Are you writing an email?"
Gumball smacks the paperclip with a shoe. This activates a dance floor, and some music.
Gumball says: "Oh no, we gotta get out of here!"
Gumball says: "We're in the world of disco!"
They run away, screaming.
Molly says: "But I love disco."
They hop on a dirigible.
Gumball says: "I don't know why they got rid of these."
Gumball says: "They're pretty cool."
The dirigible catches fire.
Gumball says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "Right."
Molly, Gumball, and Darwin run away, screaming one more. The dirigible hits a tower, and explodes. Meanwhile on another piece of land….
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Janice!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Janice!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Janice!"
The three others hop on the plot of land.
Darwin says: "Oh no, guys!"
Darwin says: "The hole's almost closed!"
Gumball says: "Mr."
Gumball says: "Small, we have to go!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "No no no!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "She has to be-I see her!"
The three others follow him.
Darwin says: "Yeah."
Darwin says: "And thick prescription glasses."
Gumball says: "Huh?"
Darwin says: "Huh?"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Here she is, kids!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Meet Janice."
He shows them a colorful van with art on it.
Darwin says: "Janice is a van?"
Gumball says: "I can see why the world thought it was a mistake."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "She runs on sunflower oil, and good vibes."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "And we've got plenty of those, right?"
They get in.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Okay!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Let's go."
Janice doesn't start up. But a voice imitating it starting up is heard.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Well that's weird."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I haven't even turned the key yet."
In front of them, they see Crazy Frog pretending to drive a motorcycle.
Gumball says: "Run him over."
The person is then chased away by Dodos.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Ooh."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "That won't be necessary."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "He's gone the way of the dodo."
He drives it up the piece of land, and into the hole. But it stops just as it exits, and hole becomes smaller. The van reverses back. Mr. Small tries to start the van again.
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "No!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Come on."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Come on!"
Gumball says: "Let me try something."
Gumball says: "Come on you gosh darn piece of junk!"
Everyone follows his lead. Darwin stops.
Darwin says: "Hey, wait."
Darwin says: "I thought you ran on good vibes."
The van immediately starts up, and leaving rainbow exhaust behind propels itself through the hole.
Back in Elmore.
A clap of thunder, followed by Janice and all her occupants appearing occurs. The van drives around in circles.
Gumball says: "AH!"
Gumball says: "Watch the trash, watch the car, watch the truck!"
Gumball says: "Trash, car, truck, trash, car, truck!"
Gumball says: "Please stop the van, I'm gonna be sick!"
The van finally stops. They all cheer.
Gumball says: "Yeah!"
Gumball says: "We did it!"
Gumball says: "In your face, world!"
Darwin says: "Guys, wait!"
Darwin says: "Do you realize what we've just seen?"
Darwin says: "This changes everything."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​ says: "We must tell everyone before the world tries to make us forget."
Molly says: "But how could we forget something like that?"
The Void sucks up their tin foil hats, along with their memories of being in it.
Gumball says: "What were we talking about again?"
Episode Ends.
