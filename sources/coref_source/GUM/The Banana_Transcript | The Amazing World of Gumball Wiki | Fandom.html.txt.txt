Chewed Pen.
Mister Small says: "This pie chart is an illustration of the composition of happiness."
Mister Small says: "This portion here represents the ratio of love needed in one's life."
Mister Small says: "This portion here is the—"
Darwin says: "Hm, I don't think it's your brain, I think it's his."
Darwin says: "He should seriously give up on this herbal tea."
Banana Joe says: "Thanks for the pen, dude!"
Darwin says: "No problem."
Gumball says: "Hmm..."
Gumball says: "Hey!"
Banana Joe says: "What?"
Gumball says: "What the derp is that?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Banana Joe says: "I don't know, what are you doing?"
Gumball says: "The pen!"
Gumball says: "You chewed his pen."
Gumball says: "What the?"
Gumball says: "Can you believe this guy?"
Darwin says: "Relax, dude, it's only a pen."
Gumball says: "Don't you "dude" me when I'm right!"
Gumball says: "You're supposed to chew things you eat, not people's stuff!"
Darwin says: "What about gum?"
Gumball says: "What about it?"
Darwin says: "You don't eat gum, but you chew that."
Darwin says: "It's even in the name, "chewing gum"."
Gumball says: "Yeah, sure, but that's specifically made for chewing."
Gumball says: "It wasn't a chewing pen, you write with a pen!"
Darwin says: "You get a fountain pen, you won't spray water with it."
Gumball says: "You just don't chew other people's pens!"
Gumball says: "It's the principle!"
Gumball says: "This is what society is built upon, respect!"
Exacting Justice!
Gumball says: "You know, Joe, there's nothing that can't be solved with an apology, Joe."
Banana Joe says: "Hmm..."
Banana Joe says: "I forgive you for accusing me of chewing the pen."
Gumball says: "Can I borrow your glue, please?"
Banana Joe says: "Yes, of course."
Gumball is puncturing the glue tube with a pencil.
Darwin says: "What are you doing?"
Darwin says: "What kind of justice is there in piercing a tube of glue like a psycho?"
Darwin says: "Ow!"
Gumball says: "Now, what do you feel is an appropriate thing to do in return?"
Darwin says: "Turn the other cheek."
Gumball says: "Which means I can do this."
Darwin says: "Ooh!"
Gumball says: "That emotion you're feeling, it's your thirst for justice."
Gumball says: "Quench it!"
Darwin says: "But what if you offer love instead of hatred?"
Friendship Card.
Banana Joe says: "How swell!"
Banana Joe says: "I should make them a card to celebrate our friendship!"
Later, Banana Joe is seen making a card. As he pours glitter on it, his hand gets stuck to the tube of glue.
Banana Joe says: "Gee, that's what I call a sticky situation!"
Joan says: "Okay, Joe, we're going to take the bandages off now, but I just want to warn you that..."
Joan says: "we did the best we could."
Banana Joe says: "Noooooooooooooo-oh!"
Banana Joe says: "Actually, not bad."
Mister Small​​​​​​​ says: "We found this tube of glue stuck to your uh..."
Mister Small​​​​​​​ says: "Anyway, in the future you need to be more careful, this tube was covered in holes."
Banana Joe says: "But, it wasn't when I lent it to Gumball."
Joan says: "Hmm..."
Mister Small​​​​​​​ says: "Hmm..."
Banana Joe says: "Hmm..."
Banana Joe says: "Oh, come on!"
Revenge.
Gumball says: "I can understand the glue, but the glitter?"
Gumball says: "That's like putting lipstick on a skeleton, it doesn't make it any nicer."
Gumball says: "You were right, dude, we should've let that pen stuff slide."
Cuts to Darwin trying to break into Joe's locker by banging a fire extinguisher on it.
Gumball says: "Dude!"
Gumball says: "Please chill out!"
Gumball says: "Here, have some love."
Darwin says: "This, this is for my homework!"
Gumball says: "Just pop it already!"
Darwin says: "He destroyed your desk, too, so chew on this!"
Darwin says: "What else can we do to it?"
Mister Small​​​​​​​ says: "Attention, please, can Gumball and Darwin Watterson please come to Mr."
Mister Small​​​​​​​ says: "Small's office?"
Mister Small​​​​​​​ says: "Thank you very much."
Resolution and Realization.
Cuts to Mr. Small's office. Gumball, Darwin, and Banana Joe are sitting on chairs. Mr. Small and Banana Joe chuckle at each other.
Mister Small​​​​ says: "Any conflict can be resolved with these three tools."
Mister Small​​​​ says: "The mirror reminds us that an enemy is just ourselves, but seen from another angle, the water reminds us that we all have something in common, and the hourglass is the time we need to reach an understanding."
Darwin says: "Come on, you googly-eyed punk!"
Gumball says: "Darwin!"
Darwin says: "We got one minute, let's finish this!"
Mister Small​​​​ says: "GEEZ LOUISE!"
Mister Small​​​​ says: "The pen!"
Mister Small​​​​ says: "Give him the new pen!"
Banana Joe says: "I didn't chew your pen, honestly!"
Banana Joe says: "But, I bought you a new one,  because I myself have a pen of great sentimental value."
Gumball says: "It's not a fountain pen, is it?"
Banana Joe says: "Actually, yes, it is."
Banana Joe says: "It's the pen that Obadiah Banana, the founder of our family, used to sign the registry when he first came to this country."
Banana Joe says: "I would lose my mind if anyone chewed on that pen!"
Banana Joe says: "Anyway, please accept this new pen, and let's be friends again."
Mister Small​​​​ says: "Aww!"
Gumball says: "Dude, we have to get to his locker before he sees what we've done."
Darwin says: "Thank you, we gotta go now, bye!"
Mister Small​​​​ says: "that's a funny name, isn't it?"
Mister Small​​​​ says: "Ah, do you spell with two or three l's?"
Gumball says: "Two, two l's!"
Darwin says: "Dude!"
Darwin says: "You could've just put another one at the end!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Of course!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Silly old hippie, I'll do another one; oh, wait, I'm all out."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Uh, I'll have to print one."
Gumball says: "Come."
Gumball says: "On!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Huh?"
Darwin says: "Just print it, please!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Yeah, sure."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Here it is, old reliable."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I don't know how it works."
Gumball says: "Just."
Gumball says: "Let."
Gumball says: "Us."
Gumball says: "Go!"
Gumball says: "Okay?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You seem a little stressed up guys, you wanna try my herbal infusion?"
Gumball says: "Mr."
Gumball says: "Small?"
Darwin says: "Yo!"
Gumball says: "Right, come on."
Mister Small​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Woooohooo!"
Joe's Family Pen.
Banana Joe walks to his locker whistling to admire his pen. Gumball and Darwin are chasing him very quickly, plowing down several classmates and school staff as they go. Despite this, Joe gets to his locker first and finds his pen. Gumball and Darwin try to turn around and walk away while Joe is "mourning" his pen, but he catches them before they get far.
Banana Joe says: "Hey!"
Banana Joe says: "Turn around, you cowards."
Gumball says: "No, thank you!"
Banana Joe says: "Turn around and face the can of butt-whoopin' that I'm gonna open on you!"
Darwin says: "Wouldn't it be better to stay like we are for that?"
Banana Joe says: "Turn around!"
Gumball says: "Augh, that's just great!"
Gumball says: "Now people are gonna come around the corner, see him like that and think we're massive bullies!"
Darwin says: "Which we are!"
Darwin says: "Because of us he lost an eye, and we attacked him with a mirror, we punctured his tube of glue, and ruined everything in his locker, he got a huge brown banana bruise on his little face and we even managed to ruin the most precious thing his family ever owned!"
Gumball says: "He did chew on the pen, though."
Darwin says: "What are you doing?"
Gumball says: "We need to make it look like he won the fight."
Gumball says: "Banana Joe, please!"
Gumball says: "Not the face!"
Darwin says: "Oh, no!"
Darwin says: "Not with the elbow!"
Gumball jumps up and down on his face while Darwin kicks himself. Both become really beaten up.
Gumball says: "Hey, dude, pull one of my teeth out!"
Banana Joe says: "What happened?"
Gumball says: "You kicked our butts like a beast, that's what happened."
Banana Joe says: "Awesome."
Banana Joe says: "Oh, hehe, I mean, I'm sorry, how did it ever come to this?"
Darwin says: "It's our fault, Joe."
Darwin says: "We didn't know it was your family pen."
Banana Joe says: "Well, Obadiah Banana always said that nothing was lost until you lose a friend, and I don't want that to happen to us."
Gumball says: "That's really lame."
Darwin says: "Group hug?"
Darwin says: "What?"
Gumball says: "Your pen, look, its got your initials on it."
The episode ends.
