Gumball and Darwin are on Shotofop and Elmore Plus.

Mrs. Jötunheim says: "What do you want?!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "!"
Gumball says: "Uh, who are you?"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "I'm Hector's mom."
Gumball and Darwin inspect her, puzzledly.
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "What?!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "!"
Gumball says: "Nothing, It's just Hector's so..."
Stretches his arms to show that Hector is big.
Gumball says: "And you're so..."
Pushes his hand closer together to show that Hector's mom is small.
Gumball says: "And you're-you're a bit..."
Makes a facial expression, imitating Hector's mom.
Gumball says: "Actually, you're more like..."
Imitates Mrs. Jötunheim almost perfectly.
Gumball says: "Anyway, is Hector in?"
Hector says: "Mom, who is it?"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Nothing to worry about, honey!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "In the absence of a door I can slam, I'm gonna do this."
Moves her hand as if slamming a door.
Gumball says: "Can we at least talk to him?"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Door."
Gumball says: "But we just want to be his friend on Elmore Plus!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "My baby doesn't need friends like you!"
Gumball says: "Ah, spoke through the door."
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Get off my property!"
Gumball groans and him and Darwin walk away.
Boring?
The scene cuts to the outside of the school.
Gumball says: "Come on, Hector, at least talk to us!"
Gumball and Darwin are shooting spitballs at Hector in the playground.
Spitball goop sticks on Hector's butt and then falls on Gumball and Darwin.
Gumball says: "Argh, forget it!"
Gumball says: "You're boring anyway."
Hector says: "What?"
Hector says: "Boring?"
Hector says: "Darwin, do you think I'm boring?"
Darwin says: "I wouldn't say "boring."
Darwin says: "" You're just..."
Darwin says: "much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much less interesting than anyone else I know."
Gumball says: "Eh."
Hector says: "But I do loads of cool stuff."
Gumball says: "Like what?"
The scene cuts to Hector's cave.
Hector says: "Well, this is my bedroom."
Gumball says: "Are you sure that your mom's not here?"
Gumball says: "It's not that I find her witch face creepy or anything, it's just that I really don't want her to jump out on me."
Gumball and Darwin stop, scream, and stare in horror at a disheveled hamster in a cage.
Gumball says: "WHAT'S THAT?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Hector says: "That's my hamster, Barney."
Darwin says: "Dude, I think that Barney is..."
Hector says: "Hibernating."
Hector says: "At least that's what my mom says."
Gumball says: "Yeah..."
Gumball says: "hibernating..."
Darwin says: "Dude!"
Darwin says: "He's got comics!"
A narrative of the comic begins, several parts of it have been clearly erased and drawn over with blue marker ink.
Captain Punch says: "No matter how much it rains, this city always smells "lovely!"
A bell is heard ringing.
Captain Punch says: "What's this?!"
Captain Punch says: "!"
Captain Punch says: "Looks like three "ski enthusiasts" have "withdrawn their" hard earned wages from the bank!"
Captain Punch says: "Better get down there!"
Captain Punch says: ""Safely!"
Captain Punch says: "" Not so fast, "gentlemen!"

Captain Punch says: "I'm going to take you down to "a nice restaurant for some swiss fondue!"
Captain Punch says: "" My treat!"
Scene cut backs to Hector's room.
Gumball says: "Dude, who drew all over your comic?"
Hector says: "That's how it was when my mom gave it to me, it's pretty cool, huh?"
Gumball says: "Umm, I think we're going to go home now."
Hector says: "No, no, wait!"
Hector says: "Let me tell some jokes, me and my mom do it all the time."
Gumball says: "Fine."
Hector says: "Why did the chicken cross the road?"
Hector says: "For a perfectly legitimate reason!"
Hector says: "He heh."
Gumball says: "Dude, that's not a joke, that's a sentence."
A music box on a pillow starts playing.
The music box stops.
Gumball says: "Hmm..."
Gumball says: "Hector's diary."
Gumball says: ""I must not laugh, I must not get overexcited, I must not shout, I must not sneeze"?"
Gumball says: "This sounds like a How-To Guide for ruining your life!"
Darwin says: "Who makes him write all this stuff?"
Gumball says: "I think I have an idea."
Darwin says: "Who?"
Gumball does an impression of Mrs. Jötunheim, who happens to be right behind them.
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "I think he means me!"
Gumball says: "I knew she'd creep up on me!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "What are you doing in my son's bedroom?!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "!"
Gumball says: "What are you doing taking the fun out of his life?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "I think you're being a little presumptuous telling me how to raise my son."
Gumball says: "Well, you know what else is presumptuous..."
Gumball says: "?"
Gumball says: "YOUR FACE!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "You don't know what presumptuous means, do you?"
Gumball says: "Yeah..."
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Just get out."
Gumball says: "..."
Gumball says: "Okay."
Gumball and Darwin start to leave. Outside the cave, Gumball scoffs.
Gumball says: "Bet you she is a witch."
Darwin says: "I think you've been insulting enough for today."
Let Your Heart Beat.
Gumball, Darwin and Hector are having lunch in the playground as the school bell rings.
Gumball says: "Do you think Hector knows what his mom is doing to him?"
Darwin says: "I don't really think it's any of our business."
Gumball says: "None of our business?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "She's the reason we've got no friends on Elmore Plus!"
Gumball says: "Yup, that's it!"
Gumball says: "I'm going to speak to him."
Gumball angrily throws his sandwich on the ground and walks up to Hector.
Gumball says: "Hector!"
Gumball says: "I've been thinking!"
Gumball says: "It's not your fault you're boring!"
Hector is loudly chewing his sandwich.
Gumball says: "Uh, you've got a bit of turkey sandwich just there."
Hector says: "Huh?"
Gumball screams as he and Darwin jump away from a giant turkey that falls to the ground.
Gumball says: "Look, it's your mom's fault you're boring."
Darwin says: "She's just strict, man."
Gumball says: "You go tell her to give you some real comics, some real movies and a real."
Gumball says: "Life."
Gumball says: "HAMST—"
Darwin quickly covers Gumball's mouth and slowly shakes his head at him.
Hector says: "But she does those things because that's what's best for me."
Gumball says: "Best for you?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Best for you?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "let it beat, man!"
Gumball says: "Let it beat!"
Darwin walks up to Gumball.
Darwin says: "That's his toe."
Gumball says: "I know."
Gumball says: "So, are you going to stand up to her, or not?!"
Gumball says: "!"
As Hector walks off, the slamming of his steps create an earthquake, causing Gumball and Darwin's faces to get all jumbled up.
Gumball says: "Good."
I'm Not Boring!
At Hector's cave, Gumball and Darwin approach the entrance and hear Hector yelling.
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Calm down, honey!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Try your breathing technique!"
Hector says: "That's boring, too!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "What have you done to my son?!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "!"
Gumball says: "Improved his life?"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "What's the one thing you know about giants?!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "!"
Gumball says: "..."
Gumball says: "That they're big?"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Yes, and so are their emotions!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "I wasn't making his life boring, I was making his life calm!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "You have to keep giants calm!"
Gumball says: "Why?"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Because if you don't, then that happens!"
In the distance, Hector is attacking the town and causing destruction.
Hector says: "IS THIS BORING, OR THIS?!"
Hector says: "!"
Hector says: "DO YOU THINK THIS IS BORING?!"
Hector says: "!"
Hector says: "CALL ME BORING NOW!"
Hector says: "IS THIS BORING?!"
Hector says: "!"
Margaret is in shock about the house.
Gaylord says: "Close the window, Margaret."
Donut Sheriff says: "Freeze!"
Donut Sheriff says: "Police!"
Hector squashes the police car.
Donut Sheriff says: "Well, uhh, I think I'll-uh call it a day."
Hector approaches the senior citizens and yells.
Hector says: "I'M NOT BOOOORIIIINGGG!!!"
The senior citizens, except for Louie, are blown away.
Louie says: "What did he say?"
Back at Hector's Cave.
Darwin says: "Gumball, what do we do?"
Darwin says: "We have to stop him!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "That's a normal broomstick."
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "I'm a cleaning lady."
Gumball says: "Oh."
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "The witchy ones are over there."
Gumball says: "I knew it."
Gumball, Darwin, and Mrs. Jötunheim fly after Hector.
Hector says: "I'm not boring!"
Hector says: "I'm not boring!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "How ya doing?"
Darwin says: "Pretty good."
Gumball says: "What the?"
Gumball says: "Hooo."
Gumball says: "Do we really have to be this high?"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Yes!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "We need to be close to his head so he can hear the  music box and fall asleep!"
Hector says: "I'm not boring!"
Hector says: "I'm not boring!"
Gumball says: "Mrs."
Gumball says: "Jötunheim?"
Gumball says: "For the record, before we go on, I'd like to apologize."
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Nah, don't sweat it kid."
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Now I'll try to calm him down."
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "You take the music box."
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Here!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Ah, just go get it!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "We'll lead him somewhere safer!"
Gumball says: "O-kay, how do you stop this thing?"
Gumball starts "swimming" towards the broom, and reaches for it. He screams as he sees the ground below him. He struggles to reach the broom and manages to get on it, and slow down just inches from the street. He nervously laughs in relief, but screams as the broom picks up speed again and goes down the street. The Senior citizens have just made it back to their seats, but get blown off once more as Gumball flies past them, except Louie who just falls off his chair. Gumball loses his grip and falls off the broom, and rolls on the asphalt, eventually grinding to a halt right next to the music box. Gumball yet again laughs nervously, then screams as he sees Hector's foot coming down on him, but Darwin dashes by and saves Gumball.
Gumball says: "Oh."
Darwin says: "Hey Gumball."
Gumball says: "Darwin!"
Gumball says: "Get me to that ear!"
They fly towards Hector.
Darwin says: "Hey Gumball, we're too heavy!"
Darwin says: "You're gonna have to jump!"
Gumball says: "Jump?"
Gumball says: "What the-  Can't you just get a little bit higher?"
Darwin says: "Why?"
Gumball points to Darwin that Hector's butt is all that they can reach.
Darwin says: "Just get on with it!"
Hector screams in pain and hits Gumball, who flies in the air and manages to grab hold of Hector' arm.
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Follow me, sweetie!"
Hector says: "Wait for me, mom."
Gumball climbs Hector's back with extreme difficulty. He then notices Darwin flying nearby with a smile on his face.
Gumball says: "What's with the smug face?"
Darwin says: "Nothing."
Darwin says: "But I think there might be a lesson in all this."
Darwin says: "You know, next time you want to judge other people's life choices, maybe you should take a long hard look at your own!"
Gumball says: "Well, maybe you should take a long hard look at that duck."
Darwin says: "Duck?"
Hector says: "Get outta my way!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Hurry up, kid!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "I'll try and lead him to the stadium!"
Gumball makes it to Hector's ear and starts winding the music box.
Hector says: "Mom!"
Hector says: "Wait for me, mom!"
Hector slips on a banana truck causing Gumball to lose his hold on the music box, which falls off.
Gumball says: "DAGNABBIT!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Whistle it!"
Gumball says: "What?"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Whistle the tune in his ear!"
Gumball says: "Okay!"
Hector arrives at the stadium, yawning. As Gumball finishes the tune, Hector collapses.
Gumball says: "Hector, uh..."
Gumball says: "I'm sorry for calling you boring."
Hector says: "I'm not sure all this excitement suits me, or anyone else."
Hector says: "I think I'll just go back to being boring."
Gumball says: "You're not boring, dude."
Gumball says: "You're nuts."
Hector starts snoring, and Gumball chuckles.
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "You okay, kid?"
Gumball says: "Yeah!"
Gumball says: "We're good."
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "Great!"
Mrs. Jötunheim says: "I'll take care of him from here!"
How to Deal with Friend Requests.
The Watterson household, the computer in the kids' bedroom makes a ping sound.
Darwin says: "We got a friend request!"
Gumball says: "Who is it?"
Gumball says: "Oh, man, it's from Hector."
Darwin says: "What shall we do?"
Darwin says: "If we say yes, he'll get excited and trash the town."
Darwin says: "If we say no, he'll get sad and trash the town."
Gumball says: "Don't worry, I know exactly what to do."
Gumball takes out a hammer and smashes it into the computer screen, at which point the episode ends.
