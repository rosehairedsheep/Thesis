Gumball says: "All I can think of is Darwin!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Go to him!"
Gumball says: "Huh?"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Your best buddy is about to play computer games with someone who’s rich, athletic, multi-colored and a good listener!"
Alan​​​​​​​​​​ says: "He’ll never play Dodge or Dare with you again!"

Gumball says: "Argh!"
Gumball says: "Twenty bucks."
Rosie says: "Seventy!"
Gumball says: "Argh!"
Gumball rides on Rosie's trike at high speed on the street dodging all the obstacles he encounters. Gumball beeps the horn as he's about to run into a brick wall.
Gumball says: "Get out of the way!"
Mark says: "I can't!"
Gumball says: "Get out of the way!"
Mark says: "I’m a brick wall!"
Manhole says: "Hey, Mark, what’s with all the commotion?"

Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Missing something?"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "What?"
Darwin says: "Ah, never mind."
Darwin says: "I already forgot."
End of vision.

Gumball says: "Ngh!"
Gumball says: "Ngh!"
Gumball says: "All because of those stupid ants and their stupid cookie!"
Gumball says: "This is all their fault!"
Gumball says: "Weeeeee!"
Gumball says: "Woo-hoo!"
Gumball says: "Oh!"
Gumball realizes he's going too fast and pushes the brakes, but the cable snaps.
Gumball says: "Ahhhh!"
The trike's right wheel comes off and breaks into pieces as Gumball falls down a slope, he then catches on fire like a meteor because of the huge velocity he’s got. He whizzes past Doughnut Sheriff’s police car making it overturn.
Gumball says: "Ahhhhh!"
Donut Sheriff says: "Yeow!"
Gumball says: "I’m coming for you, buddy!"
Gumball says: "Hold on—"
At Tobias’ House.

Tobias next to an orange bounce ball turns to Gumball and pauses the game.
Gumball says: "WHAT DID YOU DO WITH MY FRIEND?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Tobias​​​​ says: "Uh..."
Tobias​​​​ says: "He’s in the garden..."
Tobias​​​​ says: "I think..."
Scene fades to Darwin looking out of a window, sobbing. Gumball approaches the window from the outside. Darwin thinks that Gumball is inside and turns around.
Darwin says: "Gumball!"
Gumball says: "Dude, I’m outside."
Darwin says: "Oh..."
The two of them run out into the garden, giving each other the secret handshake before hugging each other.
Gumball says: "I can’t believe you were gonna play computer games with Tobias."
Darwin says: "But you played Dodge or Dare with someone else."
Gumball says: "Oh, it didn’t mean anything."
Gumball says: "I don’t even like Adam."
Darwin says: "Alan."
Gumball says: "Nyah, whatever."
Darwin says: "Best friends?"
Gumball says: "Forever!"
Gumball says: "Yay!"
Darwin says: "Yay!"
Scene fades to Gumball and Darwin playing Kebab Fighter on Tobias’ Z-Station.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Hey guys, shall I plug in a third controller, or what?"
Gumball says: "No!"
