Give Her Back!
On the school bus on the way to school, Anais is trying to get her Daisy the Donkey doll back from being thrown around by Tobias and Carrie.
Tobias​​​​​ says: "You want it, come and get it."
Anais says: "Hey, give it back!"
Anais says: "Put it down!"
Anais says: "Daisy!"
Anais says: "Leave her alone!"
She turns around towards Gumball and Darwin.
Tobias says: "I got it!"
Carrie says: "Come on, Tobias, over here!"
Anais says: "Gumball, do something!"
Gumball says: "Sorry, there's nothing I can do, sis."
Gumball says: "You broke childhood rule number four: never get a toy out on a school bus."
Anais says: "You were the one who brought her on board!"
Gumball says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "Well, let that be a lesson to all of us."
Anais says: "Oh, Gumball, please get Daisy back for me."
Anais says: "That's what big brothers are supposed to do."
Gumball says: "Hmm..."
Gumball says: "I don't know."
Gumball says: "I'm not much of a fighter."
Gumball says: "I'm more of a, uh..."
Darwin says: "A coward?"
Gumball says: "That's the word."
Anais starts whimpering with big puppy eyes.
Gumball says: "Okay, let me see what I can do."
Gumball walks towards Tobias, who is holding Daisy.
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "Come on, who wants it next?"
Gumball says: "Hey, punks, give me that donkey or else."
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "Pbht."
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "Or what?"
Gumball says: "You do not wanna know."
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "Really?"
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "What if I do this?"
Gumball says: "Then you would unleash the full fury of my terrifying anger."
Gumball says: "Mountains will shake!"
Gumball says: "Cities will crumble!"
Gumball says: "The sky could be ripped apart, and the meteor of my wrath will grind you to dust!"
Tobias lets go of Daisy.
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "Oops."
Gumball says: "Oh, man."
Gumball says: "Kind of hoped you'd buy the bluff."
Anais runs to the rear window and bangs on it repeatedly.
Anais says: "Daisy!"
Anais says: "NOOOOO!"
Anais says: "NO!"
Anais says: "NO!"
Anais says: "NOOO!"
Anais keeps crying.
Gumball says: "Relax sis, It's only a toy."
Anais says: "NO, IT'S NOT!"
Gumball and Darwin slightly back away in fear.
Gumball says: "Okay, we'll get it back."
Gumball and Darwin smiles nervously.
Anais says: "Daisyyyyyy!"
The school bus speeds off and Leslie walks into the street, noticing the doll.
Leslie​​​​​​​ says: "Oh."
Leslie picks up Daisy and walks away.
School Playground.
Gumball and Darwin are talking to Leslie.
Gumball says: "Seriously, dude, you got to give it back."
Gumball says: "My sister is blowing a fuse."
Leslie​​​​​​ says: "Sorry, guys."
Leslie​​​​​​ says: "I gave it to Juke."
Gumball and Darwin go to Juke, who makes beat-boxing noises and shrugs.
Gumball says: "Nice beats, but not much help."
Juke waves his arms and points to a bench with Daisy on it, and Gumball and Darwin run toward it.
Gumball says: "Daisy!"
Darwin says: "Daisy!"
Darwin says: "Yay!"
Gumball says: "Whoo-hoo!"
When they reach the bench, Hector sits on it.
Gumball says: "Ahem!"
Gumball says: "Hector, I think you're sitting on something."
Hector stands up with the doll on his butt.
Gumball says: "Uh, okay, this is a little embarrassing."
Gumball says: "You tell him."
Darwin says: "Excuse me, sir."
Darwin says: "You appear to have a little something stuck to your right..."
Darwin says: "buttock."
Hector says: "Huh?"
Hector flicks the doll off of his behind.
Gumball says: "I got it!"
Gumball says: "Ah!"
Gumball says: "Got it!"
Gumball says: "Ugh!"
Gumball crashes into a basketball pole, and the doll continues flying away.
Darwin says: "I got it, I got it, I got it!"
Darwin says: "I don't got it."
Gumball says: "Why?"
Darwin points at Tina, who has the doll and is playing with it.
Daisy the Donkey​​​​​​ says: "Sweet Dreams."
Tina laughs. Gumball and Darwin approach her.
Tina roars at them.
Darwin says: "Plan B?"
Gumball says: "Y-Y-Yeah."
The Hallway.
Anais is at her locker, sad because of her lost doll, when Gumball and Darwin arrive.
Gumball says: "Anais, Anais!"
Gumball says: "Look what we found."
Anais says: "Wait a minute."
Anais says: "That's not the real one."
Gumball says: "No, it's much better."
Gumball says: "Look."
Fake Daisy says: "I am Daisy the small donkey, I love to dance."
Fake Daisy says: "I am Daisy the small donkey, I love to..."
The fake doll burns and breaks. Gumball and Darwin look at Anais nervously.
Anais says: "Weak attempt to pawn me off with a cheap replacement."
Anais says: "Where's my Daisy?"
Anais says: "Sweaty hands..."
Anais says: "nervous body language."
Anais says: "You know who's got her, don't you?"
Gumball says: "Noooooo..."
Darwin says: "Noooooo..."
Anais says: "Your eyes just darted to the left."
Anais says: "You're lying, aren't you?"
Gumball says: "Noooooo..."
Darwin says: "Noooooo..."
Anais says: "It's Tina, isn't it?"
Gumball says: "Nooo—"
Darwin says: "Nooo—"
Gumball and Darwin look down dejectedly.
Gumball says: "Yeah, it's Tina."
The Wattersons.
Gumball, Darwin, and Anais are in their bedroom.
Anais says: "Listen, Gumball, I am not spending the night without Daisy."
Anais says: "You'll just have to go to Tina's place and get her back."
Gumball says: "What?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Why me?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Anais says: "Because—"
Anais says: "because—"
Anais says: "Because you were the one who lost it in the first place."
Gumball says: "But I'm just a little boy, and she's a giant T-Rex."
Anais says: "But you are my big brother."
Gumball says: "But I don't want to get my face pounded to a pulp."
Both of them continue to exchange cute faces at each other until Gumball gives in.
Gumball says: "Fine."
Gumball says: "I'll go."
Anais giggles.
Gumball says: "But you two are coming with me."
Darwin and Anais both groan with exasperation and acceptance.
At Tina's.
Gumball, Darwin and Anais are peeking through a gap in the door of Tina's room.
Gumball says: "Man, this place is scary."
Gumball says: "Is that really her bedroom?"
Anais says: "It's a dump."
Gumball says: "Literally."
Anais says: "It's really sad."
Gumball says: "Look."
Gumball points at Tina, who has the doll in her arms.
Anais says: "Daisy!"
They stop looking through the gap.
Gumball says: "Okay, here's the plan-get inside, lift up her arm, take the toy and get out of there."
Gumball says: "You got that, Darwin?"
Gumball says: "Go."
Darwin says: "I'm not doing that!"
Gumball says: "I'm not either."
Gumball says: "There's a T-Rex in there."
Anais says: "Well, one of you better go."
Anais says: "Otherwise, I'm telling Mom."
Gumball says: "Hmm..."
Gumball says: "getting told off by Mom or fighting a T-Rex..."
Gumball says: "Mom, T-Rex, Mom, T-Rex..."
Darwin says: "Well, I'm going with the T-Rex."
Gumball says: "Yeah."
Gumball says: "No contest."
Gumball and Darwin enter Tina's room, Darwin making squeaking noises as they walk.
Gumball says: "Darwin, why are you making that noise?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "I'm sorry!"
Darwin says: "I always do it when I'm nervous."
Gumball says: "Well, stop it!"
Darwin covers his mouth, and they continue walking. When they are near Tina, she makes a movement that scares them.
Gumball says: "Anais!"
Anais says: "What?!"
Anais says: "!"
Gumball says: "You see that pole over there?"
Gumball says: "Throw it to me."
Gumball holds up his hands.
Anais says: "Okay."
Darwin says: "No, no."
Darwin says: "He can't catch."
Anais says: "Here it comes."
Anais throws the pole. Gumball misses the catch, and hits Darwin.
Darwin says: "Ow!"
The pole hits the metal junk.
Tina says: "Huh?"
Tina goes back to sleep.
Gumball says: "Phew!"
Anais expertly throws the pole and Gumball jumps to grab it, but misses and it hits Darwin, knocking him down, before clattering on the ground. Tina stirs, but does not wake up, and Gumball sighs in relief.
Darwin says: "I'm okay."
Gumball says: "Shh!"
Gumball shushes him, picks up the pole, and begins poking Tina.
Darwin says: "Careful."
Darwin says: "Careful!"
Gumball says: "I'm sorry!"
Gumball says: "It's just really hard to maneuver a long pole."
Darwin laughs.
Darwin says: "Look, it's like she's smiling."
Gumball has on the corner of Tina's mouth and moves it up and down, making her look happy and sad.
Darwin says: "Happy, sad, happy, sad."
Gumball and Darwin snicker quietly.
Gumball says: "Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum."
Gumball begins picking Tina's nose and poking at her mouth, making noises. They both snicker quietly. Anais walks up behind them.
Anais says: "What are you doing?!"
Anais says: "!"
Gumball says: "Don't worry."
Gumball says: "She'll never wake up."
Tina stirs again, frightening Gumball, Darwin and Anais, and rolls over on top of Daisy.
Gumball says: "Okay, I think we have to move her."
With difficulty, Gumball and Darwin move Tina until they can see Daisy again.
Gumball says: "Hold it, buddy!"
Gumball says: "Let me see."
Gumball reaches out for Daisy.
Darwin says: "Gumball!"
Gumball says: "Shh!"
Gumball says: "What?"
Darwin says: "You have to help me."
Gumball says: "Yeah, yeah, just two seconds."
Darwin says: "Gumball..."
Darwin falls under Tina and Gumball gasps, but Darwin manages to get out from under her.
Darwin says: "I'm okay."
Gumball and Anais sigh in relief and Gumball gasps when he sees Daisy, grabbing her.
Gumball says: "Yes, yes!"
Gumball says: "I got it!"
Gumball lifts up Daisy, but the doll's string is caught on Tina's finger, and it then frees itself.
Daisy the Donkey​​​​​​ says: "Sweet Dreams!"
Daisy starts braying and Tina suddenly wakes up.
Gumball says: "Run."
The kids run off screaming with Tina chasing them.
The Chase.
Anais says: "Gumball!"
Gumball says: "What?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Anais says: "Gumball!"
Gumball says: "What?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball sees Tina right behind them and screams. The three hide in a car and Gumball tries to roll up the window, but Tina stops him, so Gumball locks the door. Tina tries to open the door from the open window, but can't reach it and Gumball, Darwin, and Anais laugh at her. Tina walks away.
Gumball says: "Phew."
Gumball says: "I think we're safe now."
The roof of the car caves in and the three scream and Gumball opens the door.
Gumball says: "Run!"
They run off.
Gumball says: "Where's Darwin?"
Darwin runs past them.
Anais says: "This was a stupid idea!"
Gumball says: "I know!"
Gumball says: "Should we just give it to her?"
Anais says: "No!"
Anais says: "She's mine!"
Gumball says: "Okay, you have it, then."
Gumball tosses Daisy at Anais, who trips, and runs off.
Anais says: "Gumball, help me!"
Gumball says: "I can't!"
Gumball says: "I'm too much of a coward!"
Darwin glares at Gumball, who sighs.
Gumball says: "Fine."
Gumball says: "Throw me Daisy!"
Gumball says: "It's what's she after."
Anais says: "Okay."
Anais says: "Go long."
Anais throws Daisy and Tina, Gumball, and Darwin run after it.
Darwin says: "Gumball, she's after us now!"
Gumball says: "Don't worry."
Gumball says: "You know I can't catch."
Daisy lands in Gumball's outstretched hands and he and Darwin stop running.
Gumball says: "I hate myself."
Gumball gives Daisy to Darwin and runs off.
Darwin says: "I hate yourself."
Gumball says: "Psst!"
Gumball says: "Over here!"
Darwin hides behind a car with Gumball and after Tina runs by, they run in the other direction.
Gumball says: "The gate!"
Gumball says: "We're nearly there."
Gumball says: "It's almost over."
Tina appears in front of the gate.
Tina says: "Not so fast."
They stop running and scream.
Gumball puts his hand on Darwin's mouth.
Gumball says: "Darwin, keep absolutely still."
Gumball says: "Her vision is based on movement."
Tina says: "That only works in movies."
Tina roars and they scream and she runs toward them, but is caught underneath a crane claw.
Gumball says: "Huh?"
Gumball and Darwin look up and see Anais.
Anais says: "Yea!"
Anais gets off the crane.
Anais says: "Daisy!"
Gumball says: "You know, Tina, there's a lesson in this somewhere."
Gumball says: "Don't mess with the Wattersons."
Gumball says: "I'm hot."
Gumball says: "I know it."
Gumball says: "You're not."
Gumball says: "You know it."
Gumball and Darwin do a dance.
Gumball says: "Who's the boss now?"
Tina says: "I'm sorry."
Tina says: "It's just that I never had a toy before."
Tina says: "I swear, I-I wanted to give it back, but..."
Tina says: "she helped me to sleep."
Tina says: "It's just so scary here."
Tina gives them a sad look.
Gumball says: "Man, those puppy eyes again."
Gumball says: "I feel really bad now."
Anais says: "You know what, Tina?"
Anais says: "I think you need Daisy more than I do."
Anais puts Daisy down in front of Tina.
Tina says: "Really?"
Anais says: "Yeah."
Anais says: "She'll look after you when you're scared."
Anais says: "Besides, I don't need her anymore."
Anais says: "I've got Darwin and Gumball to look after me."
Gumball says: "Group hug."
Darwin says: "Group hug."
They hug.
Tina says: "That's very touching."
Tina says: "But now you'd better start running."
Gumball says: "Why?"
Darwin says: "Why?"
Anais says: "Why?"
Tina says: "My dad eats trespassers."
Tina's dad comes up behind them and roars.
Episode ends.
