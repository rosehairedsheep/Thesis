Weird Stutter.
The episode starts with Gumball and Darwin at the Elmore Mall; the screen stutters for a brief duration.
Gumball says: "You’re what?"
Darwin says: "Just trying on hats."
Darwin says: "I feel like my look is missing a little something."
Gumball says: "Dude, your look is missing everything except shoes."
Darwin says: "Exactly."
Darwin says: "Step one—"
Darwin says: "shoes."
Gumball says: "Uh, step two isn’t hat."
Gumball says: "And for the record, step one is pants."
Darwin says: "What do you think?"
Gumball says: "Nah."
Gumball says: "I think it’s a bit eh—"
Darwin says: "You’re right."
Darwin says: "Too desperate for attention."
Darwin takes off the hat and looks for another one in the box. Gumball touches his face and looks at his surroundings as Darwin puts on a dark grey hat.
Darwin says: "Whoo!"
Darwin says: "How about this?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, that one makes looks kind of eh-h-h-h-h-h-h—"
Darwin says: "Yeah, I get it."
Darwin says: "Too "thinkin’ it’s cool, but lonely at school."
Gumball says: "What just happened?"
Darwin says: "How about this?"
Darwin says: "I really like this one, but do you think it makes me look like I have a fat head?"
Darwin says: "Don’t spare my feelings."
Darwin says: "Just tell me."
Gumball says: "I like it!"
Gumball says: "Wha- Darwin, where are you going?"
Darwin says: "To the food court!"
Darwin says: "If that's okay with you."
Gumball says: "No!"
Gumball says: "I d-d-d-d—"
Darwin says: "Fine!"
Darwin says: "If you think I've got such a fat head, maybe I'll go work out instead."
Gumball says: "—"
Gumball says: "d-d-d-didn't mean that!"
Gumball says: "Come on!"
Gumball says: "Wait up!"
Gumball says: "Why are you mad at me?"
Gumball says: "Buddy!"
Lost signal displays. Zoom out to reveal that it is the Wattersons' TV.
Richard says: "Oh!"
Richard says: "Come on!"
Richard says: "All right, there's only one thing to do."
Gumball says: "Dad, have you seen Dar—"
Richard is pushing the couch into the kitchen.
Gumball says: "Dad, what are you doing?"
Richard says: "The TV was being weird."
Richard says: "I'm moving the couch so I can watch the second most interesting thing in this house!"
Gumball says: "What's that?"
Richard says: "The fridge!"
Richard says: "Pickles..."
Gumball facepalms.
Working Out.
Gumball goes to Darwin, who is about to do pull ups in the doorway.
Gumball says: "Aw, dude."
Gumball says: "You don't have to do that, you're not fat at all."
Darwin breathes heavily, trying to do a pull up while Gumball slowly goes down.
Darwin says: "What are you doing?"
Gumball says: "Well, you weren't really going up, so I thought I'd better go down."
Gumball says: "You know, to make you feel better."
Darwin says: "Ugh!"
Darwin says: "Whatever."
Metal bar falls off door.
Darwin gets on bench press.
Gumball says: "Wait, wait, wait!"
Gumball says: "Whoa, whoa."
Gumball says: "At least let me dispatch you buddy!"
Gumball says: "Safety first!"
Darwin says: "A quarter!"
Darwin says: "A-a Half!"
Darwin says: "A third!"
Darwin says: "TAKE IT!"
Darwin says: "TAKE IT!"
Darwin drops barbell, making it fall on his face, shoes pop off and break the window. After a while, he manages to lift the barbell off his face.
Gumball says: "-ayay I got it!"
Gumball accidentally pushes the barbell between Darwin's head and legs, causing the bench press to break in half.
In the bathroom.
Gumball says: "Ah, see?"
Gumball says: "That's mu—"
Static; Darwin datamoshes, Gumball covers his mouth and gags.
Darwin says: "What?"
Gumball says: "Uh..."
Gumball says: "Nothing."
Gumball says: "Nothing."
Gumball says: "Uh, come on, let's just hug it out."
Gumball says: "Aah!"
Gumball says: "Oh!"
Gumball says: "Oh, your face!"
Gumball says: "Ugh!"
Gumball says: "Ugh!"
Gumball says: "Can you get up, I think I'm going to be sick!"
Darwin says: "Could you be any more insulting?"
Gumball says: "Dude, let me explain!"
Gumball says: "There's..."
Gumball says: "There's something weird going on here."
Apology Letter.
Darwin says: "What's that?"
Gumball says: "Oh!"
Gumball says: "It's..."
Gumball says: "umm..."
Gumball says: "It's a letter."
Gumball says: "Uh..."
Gumball says: "a letter I wrote for you."
Darwin says: "You gonna read it then?"
Gumball says: "Nnnn..."
Gumball says: "Okay."

Darwin says: "I've done enough storming out for one day."
Darwin says: "I think it's your turn to leave."
Gumball says: "Look!"
Gumball says: "Can I just..."
Gumball says: "I'll..."
Gumball says: "uh..."
Gumball says: "take that as a no."
Richard says: "Goodbye."
Gumball says: "What's wrong, Dad?"
Richard says: "I just turned the TV off!"
Gumball says: "Uh..."
Gumball says: "Right."
Gumball says: "Can I speak to you?"
Richard says: "Sure!"
Gumball says: "You notice anything weird lately?"
Gumball says: "Like, you know, strange things happening?"
Gumball says: "Wha?"
Richard says: "..."
Richard says: "on your new speed boat!"
Gumball says: "Are you trying to be funny?"
Richard makes a laugh track sound.
Gumball says: "Okay..."
Darwin enters.
Darwin says: "Gumball, I've just realized there's no point me being angry upstairs by myself."
Gumball says: "Oh, w-w-well, great!"
Gumball says: "So, you're.."
Gumball says: "er  not mad anymore?"
Darwin says: "No, I am."
Darwin says: "I'm just gonna do it somewhere you can see it."
Gumball says: "Look, I think I know why you're so mad at me."
Gumball says: "Something weird is going on, ok?"
Gumball says: "So just give me a chance to explain."
Gumball says: "you-a-wl-e-wl-e."
Gumball says: "Oh, come on!"
Darwin says: "All right, just take your time and say what you need to say."
A sign appears that says “Lost Signal” and everything goes black. Then the screen turns back on.
