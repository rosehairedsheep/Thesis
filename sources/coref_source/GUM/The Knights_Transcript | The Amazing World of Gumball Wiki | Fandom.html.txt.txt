Anais sighs.
Gumball says: "DARWIN, WHERE ARE THE COOKIES?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "THEY'RE NOT COOKED YET!"

Gumball says: "AND WHY ARE THERE TIRES IN THE BAAATH?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball throws the tires at Richard.
In the bathroom, Gumball strains to get the toothpaste out.
Gumball says: "Come on, come on, come on!"

Patrick and Penny are driving down a street.
Patrick says: "Look, Penny, I know you like this kid, but are you sure there isn't a better partner for your medieval assignment?"
Patrick says: "I don't like this part of town."
Penny says: "Dad, we've been through this, and you said that you would trust my judgement."
Patrick says: "I know, I'm sorry, sweetie."
Patrick says: "I'm sure Gumball and his family are lovely people."
Patrick's car passes the Wattersons' house. Penny and Patrick both gasp.
Anais says: "Gumball, she's here!"
Anais says: "Hi!"
Anais says: "Whoa!"
Anais falls off the ladder, she laughs, Richard is taking a shower in the bushes naked.
Richard says: "Hi!"
Nicole comes out of a heap of trash bags.
Nicole says: "Oh, hi!"
Darwin appears on the porch with a sheet of burnt cookies.

Gumball pushes Darwin aside and runs down the steps with soap foam in his mouth.
Gumball says: "Hello!"
Gumball says: "Welcome to the Wattersons' house!"

No Partner for Assignment.
At Elmore Junior High, Gumball, Darwin, Idaho, and Tobias wearing a black and purple medieval tunic and hat are on the steps, while Penny can be seen walking toward all of them.
Idaho says: "Tobias, you're taking this medieval assignment way too seriously."
Idaho says: "Are they your mama's stilettos?"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "This, you rustic troglodyte, will allow me to attract fair Penny to be my study partner."
Penny walks by.
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Good morrow, fair maid!"
Penny says: "Nice tights."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Why, thank you!"
Idaho says: "I think that was irony."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "No, it wasn't."
Penny says: "Yes, it was!"
Scene cuts to where Gumball and Darwin are sitting on the left side of the school stairs.
Penny says: "Hey, Gumball, I just wanted to say sorry, about last night."
Gumball says: "Last night?"
Gumball says: "What happened?"
Gumball says: "Oh-oh yeah, you were gonna come over to work on our medieval assignment."
Gumball says: "But you didn't."
Gumball says: "Psh, I didn't even notice since I was so busy."
Penny says: "Really?"
Penny says: "But, my dad said you were calling our house till like, four in the morning."
Gumball says: "Pssssh."
Gumball says: "That could've been anyone."
Gumball says: "No one picked up the phone, so there's no one you can know it was me!"
Patrick comes in to pick up Penny.
Penny says: "Listen, I can't really talk right now."
Gumball says: "Why?"
Penny points at her dad to Gumball. Gumball looks confused, and at the same time is squinting his eyes.
Gumball says: "Are you trying to throw away your thumb or something?"
Penny says: "No, it's my dad."
Penny says: "He doesn't really want us hanging out together, and..."
Penny's voice becomes almost inaudible because of Patrick angrily glaring at Gumball. The glaring eventually 'burns' a red dot on Gumball's forehead, but he pats it out.
Penny says: "See ya later."
Gumball says: "Oh, hi, Mr."
Gumball says: "Fitzgerald!"
Penny sighs and gets in the car.
Gumball says: "I think we got off on the wrong foot yesterday."
Gumball says: "I'll just put that back on here."
The rear viev falls off again.
Patrick says: "Watterson, stay away from my car, and stay away from my daughter."
Penny says: "Can I say something here?"
Patrick says: "No!"
Patrick drives away; Gumball sighs.
Darwin says: "Don't worry."
Darwin says: "You'll pass that medieval assignment."
Darwin says: "You know the whole book by heart."
Gumball says: "But I..."
Gumball says: "but I learned it all for her."
Darwin says: "Well, that was a waste of time."
Darwin says: "Her dad hates you."
Gumball says: "Oh, come on."
Gumball says: "I'm not that bad."
Darwin looks doubtfully at Gumball.
Gumball says: "Then..."
Gumball says: "then I shall prove myself to him."
Tobias can be heard laughing, then the scene changes to Tobias, who is still on the stairs.
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "So the simple knave intends to take the hand of fair Penny."
The camera zooms out, revealing that Tobias is the only one on the steps.
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Oh."
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Hey, guys, you weren't listening!"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "I was explaining everything!"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Guys!"
Not Good Enough.
At the Fitzgerald house, Gumball rings the doorbell, and Patrick opens the door and groans angrily.
Gumball says: "Hi, Mr."
Gumball says: "Fitzgerald!"
Gumball says: "I made you a mixtape and a cake."
Gumball says: "See?"
Gumball says: "I'm not that bad!"
Patrick slams the door, but Gumball drops the mix tape and pushes the cake through the mail delivery slot. The cake falls out in pieces and splatters on the floor, all over the mixtape.
Scene changes to Patrick jogging along a street. Gumball catches up to him.
Gumball says: "Oh, Mr."
Gumball says: "Fitzgerald."
Gumball says: "What a surprise, we must jog the same route."
Gumball says: "Yeah, you look really sweaty."
Gumball says: "Here, let me help you!"

Patrick says: "What the—"
Patrick says: "what are you—"
Patrick says: "Get away from me!"
Gumball says: "Mr."
Gumball says: "Fitzgerald, I..."

Gumball says: "I'm not that bad!"
Gumball falls back behind him due to exhaustion.
Scene changes to Patrick at a construction site with two workers.
Patrick says: "So, there were two muffins in this oven."
Patrick says: "The first muffin says, "Good grief, it's hot in here!"

Gumball laughs as well, and Patrick and his co-workers glare at him.
Gumball says: "That reminds me of one time when me and Mr."
Gumball says: "Fitzgerald where..."
Gumball says: "umh..."
Gumball says: "where..."
Gumball says: "uuh..."
Gumball says: "We never hang out."

Gumball says: "I wanna study with your daughter, I know you don't think that I oughta."
Gumball says: "I'm not that bad I'm pretty friendly, I think that you should be—"
Patrick angrily grabs Gumball's ukulele and crushes it in his hands.
Patrick says: "I don't care."
Patrick says: "You are not good enough for my daughter, and I don't want you around her."
Patrick says: "End."
Patrick says: "Of."
Patrick says: "Story!"
Pause.
Gumball says: "So why don't you gimme one more—"
Patrick slams the door, only to find the doorbell ringing again. He opens the door, only to see Tobias at the doorway.
Tobias​​​​​ says: "I am Sir Tobias of Elmore and I'm here to claim your daughter's hand."
Patrick slams the door again.
Tobias​​​​​ says: "AHH!"
Tobias​​​​​ says: "Please sir..."
Tobias​​​​​ says: "releaseth my foot..."
Tobias​​​​​ says: "Let not this door stand in the way of true love."
Tobias​​​​​ says: "Just at least open it a little bit so I can get my foot out."
The door lock goes off.
Tobias​​​​​ says: "Okay, I'll squeeze it out myself."
Tobias​​​​​ says: "It's really hard because my toes are swollen now!"
Tobias​​​​​ says: "Aaah..."
Tobias​​​​​ says: "Ahh..."
Tobias​​​​​ says: "Ohh..."
Scene goes back inside the Fitzgerald house. Patrick is at the stairs.
Patrick says: "Hey, Penny, what is it with you and boys these days?"
Patrick says: "Penny?"
Patrick says: "Penny?"
The Duel.
Gumball walks dejectedly. He sees Penny sitting on the Watterson's doorstep reading a book.
Gumball says: "Penny!"
Gumball says: "I thought your dad didn't want you to come over."
Penny says: "Exactly."
Penny says: "That's why I asked my mom."
Gumball says: "Cool."
Gumball says: "Do you still want to study?"
Gumball says: "Because I know that medieval stuff by heart!"
Tobias slaps Gumball with his glove.
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "Have at you, you cantankerous oaf!"
Gumball says: "Tobias?"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "I demand satisfaction."
Gumball says: "For what?"
Tobias slaps Gumball with his glove again.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "For stealing the hand of my promised!"
Gumball says: "What the heck do you want, dude?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I demand..."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "a duel."
Gumball says: "I don't want to duel."
Gumball says: "I'm not doing this."
Tobias continuously slaps Gumball with one glove.
Scene changes to front of house, the boys are preparing to joust.
Gumball says: "If I do this, you're gonna leave us alone, right?"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Hahaha!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Only if you win."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "If you lose, Lady Penny is mine."
Penny says: "No, I'm not."
Gumball says: "Yeah, did you consider Penny's feeling in any of this?"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "In time, she will learn to love me."
Penny says: "No, I won't."
Tobias sighs, then makes noises with his mouth of the horse's neighing and galloping.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Let the joust commence."
Gumball and Tobias runs towards each other. Gumball's skateboard hits a rock.
Gumball says: "Ahhh, woah!"
Tobias gets up, albeit hurt.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "A worthy foe, but how are you at hand-to-hand combat?"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "En garde!"
Gumball gets up and turns around, one of his eyes are red.
Gumball says: "You're a complete nutcase, man!"
Gumball says: "I don't want to fight you anymore."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Then victory is mine and I shall take the hand of my lady."
Tobias grabs the hand of Penny.
Gumball says: "Never!"
Gumball says: "Oh sorry."
Gumball says: "Oh, are you okay?"
Tobias gets angry and attacks him again.
Penny says: "Hey!"
Tobias hisses and the two boys fence each other. Soon Tobias gains the upper hand.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Dance for me, jester, dance!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Faster, jester, faster!"
Penny gasps and she grabs her book.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Faster, jester, faster!"
Penny throws her book at Tobias' face, hitting him.
Gumball says: "Haha!"
Gumball says: "Thanks, Penny!"
Gumball gets covered under the trash can by Tobias, who then proceeds to hit him again.
Penny says: "Tobias, stop it!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I'll stop in exchange for a kiss."
Gumball says: "NO!"
Gumball removes the trash can off himself and accidentally throws his broom at Penny, knocking her over.
Gumball says: "Oh!"
Gumball says: "Sorry."
Penny says: "It's okay."
Tobias swings his handle at Gumball repeatedly.
Gumball says: "Waitwawawawaitwaitwait."
Tobias pauses as Gumball catches his breath.
Gumball says: "Okay, go."
Tobias resumes swinging.
Gumball says: "That's better."
Gumball says: "Penny!"
Gumball says: "Penny!"
Penny says: "What?"
Gumball says: "Can you throw me my sword?"
Penny says: "You mean your broom?"
Gumball says: "Yes."
Tobias throws the trash can at Gumball.
Penny says: "Gumball, can we just do the assignment now, please?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, just give me a second, I think he's getting tired."
Patrick is driving around the neighborhood.
Patrick says: "She better not be around here."
Patrick says: "I hate this lousy neighborhood."
Penny tries to retain Tobias from attacking Gumball further.
Gumball says: "Penny, get back, you're gonna get hurt."
Penny says: "I wouldn't have to help if you weren't losing."
Gumball says: "I'm not losing."
Gumball says: "I'm just catching my breath."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Step aside, woman!"
Patrick approaches the Watterson house.
Patrick says: "That little punk again."
The scene begins to play in slow-motion. Penny gets up, right in front of Patrick's approaching car. He doesn't notice her yet.
Gumball says: "Penny!"
As Tobias watches, Gumball jumps in front of Patrick's car in slow-motion.
Gumball says: "No!"
Penny and Patrick both gasp.
Gumball says: "NOOOOO!!"
As Gumball pushes Penny out of the way, Patrick swerves. Tobias now looks shocked, so does Patrick. As Patrick heads towards the house, past Tobias, his rear view mirror breaks off again, then Patrick crashes off-screen. Everyone is stunned.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Okay, you win."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Bye!"
Epilogue.
Penny says: "Dad!"
Patrick says: "Are you kids okay?"
Gumball says: "We're fine."
Patrick says: "Thank you so much, Gumball."
Patrick says: "You saved my little girl's life."
Patrick says: "I can't believe I took you and your family for such a bunch of..."

Richard says: "!"
Richard says: "NICOLE, GET OUT HERE!"
Richard says: "THIS CLOWN NEARLY RAN OVER OUR KID!"
Nicole says: "WHAT?!"
Nicole says: "!"
Patrick says: "I-It's not what it looks like."
Nicole says: "I don't want you, near my family, ever again."
Patrick says: "Please."
Patrick says: "Here, let me just pay you."
Nicole says: "I don't want your money!"
Nicole says: "You come around here..."
Patrick is now nervous as the entire Watterson family angrily complain, yell and protest at Patrick, while Gumball and Penny do nothing but turn around and innocently shrug.
The episode ends.
