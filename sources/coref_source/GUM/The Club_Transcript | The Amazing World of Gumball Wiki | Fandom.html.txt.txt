Club Searching.
Episode starts in school.
Richard says: "Come on, you guys!"
Richard says: "We're gonna be late!"
Gumball says: "Remind me again why exactly we're at school on a Saturday."
Richard says: "Are you kidding me?"
Richard says: "It's club day."
Richard says: "It's the only day of the week when I get to hang out with people I really like."
Gumball says: "What?!"
Darwin says: "What?!"
Nicole says: "What?!"
Anais says: "What?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "!"
Nicole says: "!"
Anais says: "!"
Richard says: "Uhh..."
Richard says: "Got to go!"
Nicole says: "Okay..."
Nicole says: "See you all back here at five."
Gumball says: "But wait!"
Gumball says: "I don't have a club to go to!"
Nicole starts walking to her club but Gumball stops her.
Gumball says: "Well, Mom, looks like it's your lucky day."
Gumball says: "I'm coming with you to your anger-management club."
Nicole says: "Oh, that's sweet, Gumball, but behind this door, I'm a very different person."
Nicole says: "Trust me, you don't want to see this."
Mister Small​​ says: "Hello, Nicole, welcome to—"
Mister Small​​ says: "Aaach!"
Anais says: "Could you guys keep it down a little?"
Nicole says: "You keep it down!"
Gumball says: "Hey, Anais."
Gumball says: "What club are you in?"
Anais says: "Physics club."
Gumball says: "Well, today's your lucky day, because I—"
Anais says: "Let me stop you right there."
Anais says: "You know there are different types of intelligence?"
Gumball says: "Yeah."
Anais says: "I don't think you have any of them."
Gumball says: "I don't get it."
Anais says: "Exactly."
Gumball says: "Oh, come on!"
Anais slams the door.
Gumball says: "Oh, let me in!"
Gumball says: "Fine."
Gumball walks to the door of the Fantasy Club room.
Gumball says: "Dad, can I join your fantasy club?"
Richard peeks from the door curtain.
Richard says: "Who be there?"
Gumball says: "It's me, Gumball."
Richard says: "Be you orc?"
Gumball says: "No."
Richard says: "Be you dwarf?"
Gumball says: "No, I'm your son."
Richard says: "Be you bearer of savory snacks for the elders?"
Gumball says: "What?"
Gumball says: "No."
Richard says: "Then begone!"
Darwin says: "What's up?"
Gumball says: "Man, there's got to be a club for me somewhere."
Darwin says: "You could always join my club."
Gumball says: "What is it?"
Scene cuts to the school swimming pool, with Darwin swimming with other members of the club.
Darwin says: "Synchronized swimming!"
Gumball says: "Hmmm."
Gumball says: "You're good, but I can do better."
Gumball says: "Here comes the swan dive of eternal beauty!"
Gumball jumps off the high dive and a swan appears behing him and honks, and he makes a big splash. It then starts raining in the swimming pool, but then stops.
Scene cuts to Gumball's vision.
Gumball says: "So, how graceful was that?"
Darwin says: "Dude, you can't swim."
Gumball says: "Fair point."
Gumball says: "Uh..."
Gumball says: "has anyone seen my trunks?"
Scene cuts to the changing room.
Tobias​​ says: "Yeaaah!"
Banana Joe says: "Touchdown!"
Tobias​​ says: "All right!"
Banana Joe says: "Slam-dunk!"
Banana Joe says: "Yeeaaaahh!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​ says: "Yeeaaaahh!"
Gumball says: "Uh, hey, guys."
Gumball says: "Is this the Football Club?"
Banana Joe says: "Yeeaaahh!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​ says: "Yeeaaahh!"
Gumball says: "Well, uh, did I miss the game?"
Banana Joe says: "No, it's going on right out there."
Gumball says: "Why aren't you playing?"
Banana Joe says: "'Cause we're the reserve team!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​ says: "'Cause we're the reserve team!"
Gumball says: "Cool."
Gumball says: "So, can I join?"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​ says: "I don't know."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​ says: "Are you man enough?"
Gumball says: "Me?"
Gumball says: "I'm at least 50% man."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​ says: "Well, in that case, here's your towel."
Gumball says: "Thanks."
Gumball says: "So..."
Gumball says: "do you guys ever get to play?"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​ says: "Nah, we just hang out here and act kinda sporty."
Gumball says: "You guys just take showers, hang around in towels, and high-five each other?"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​ says: "Heh!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​ says: "There's a little bit more to it than that."
Gumball says: "Ah!"
Gumball says: "Ow!"
Gumball says: "Okay!"
Gumball says: "Ow!"
Gumball says: "Okay, okay!"
They all begin hitting each other and laughing, Hector comes in wearing his towel.
Tobias​​​​​​​​​ says: "Hey, Hector, is the game over?"
Hector says: "Yeah."
Hector says: "We lost."
Banana Joe says: "Oh."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​ says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "What?"
Hector hits them with his towel and they all scream. Gumball walks in pain as he attempts to enter the Tragedy Club room, but the door is quickly locked and the curtain is closed.
Gumball says: "Oh, why doesn't anyone want me in their club?"
Gumball says: "It can't have anything to do with me -- my talent, my intelligence, or my general awesomeness."
Gumball says: "You know what?"
Gumball says: "Too bad for you jealous people, 'cause I'm starting my own club, and you are not invited!"
Gumball's Club of Gumball.
Gumball says: "Okay, I'd like to welcome everyone to "Gumball's Club of Gumball."
Gumball says: "" First order of business: attendance."
Gumball says: "Hmm."
Gumball says: "Pretty good."
Gumball says: "Now, it seems like lately we've been let down by certain..."
Gumball says: "family members."
Gumball says: "So I propose a little exercise in trust."
Gumball says: "Okay, don't worry, Gumball."
Gumball says: "Just close your eyes, let yourself fall back, and someone will catch you."
Gumball says: "Aye."
Gumball says: "Motion carried."
Rejects' Greetings.
Scene cuts to Gumball wandering along the school corridor.
Gumball says: "Aw, man, I'm such a reject."
Gumball says: "I wish there was a club for people like me that no one liked."
Gumball says: "I'd join that club in a second."
Gumball says: "I wouldn't even care what it was about."
The corridor lamps shut down, and a strange noise echoes through the corridor.
Gumball says: "Uh..."
Gumball says: "what's going on?"
Colin says: "Look no further, fellow loser."
Gumball says: "What the..."
Gumball says: "?"
Colin says: "We are the unsought, the weird."
Colin says: "Let me introduce you to..."
Colin says: "..."
Colin says: "The Reject Club!"
Colin says: "Always accepting new members."
Gumball says: "Thanks, I'm desperate, but not that desperate."
Colin says: "No, wait!"
Colin says: "We really need new members."
Colin says: "We're so bored of talking to each other, we've been phoning up the talking clock for conversation."
Colin says: "If you want, you could be our president or something."
Colin says: "Or-or-or even better, our king!"
Colin says: "Picture this: Gumball Watterson, king of the rejects!"
Felix says: "Eh?"
Bobert says: "Eh?"
Ocho says: "Eh?"
Felix says: "He rejected us."
Bobert says: "And laughed at our loneliness."
Colin says: "Well, we'll see if he's still too good for us when we've finished with him."
Colin says: "To the nerd-mobile!"
The Reject Club walk like vampires, humming the old Batman theme.
Family Discussion.
At the Wattersons'.
Gumball says: "Rejected, even by my own family!"
Nicole says: "Look, honey, you're not a baby anymore."
Nicole says: "You need to be able to do things on your own."
Richard says: "Oh, there must have been one club that wanted you."
Darwin says: "Yeah, The Rejects Club."
Gumball says: "But I politely declined."
A brick flies through the window, onto the dining table.
Richard says: "Aaaah!"
Richard says: "The cake!"
Gumball says: "Look!"
Darwin says: "There's a DVD tied to it."
The Plan Unfolds.
Scene cuts to the living room.
Colin says: "Greetings, Gumball Watterson, from our secret lair."
Anais says: "Isn't that just the library?"
Richard says: "Shh!"
Richard says: "There's more!"
Colin says: "My name is Gumball Watterson and my IQ is smaller than my shoe size."
Colin says: "I wore diapers until the age of eleven and once got detention for calling Miss Simian "mum."
Richard says: "He looks just like you!"
Colin says: "Our revenge plan is almost complete."
Computer says: "Uploading."
Computer says: "Ten minutes until completion."
Colin says: "And, cut!"
Colin says: "How was I?"
Colin says: "Evil enough?"
Gumball says: "Oh, great, now the nerds are bullying me!"
Gumball says: "I guess you want me to deal with this on my own."
Nicole says: "No."
Nicole says: "When someone picks a fight with one of us, they pick a fight with all of us."
Nicole says: "Everybody, get in the car."
Nicole says: "We've still got time to stop them."
Richard says: "But where is their secret hideout?"
Anais says: "It's in the library!"
Rush to the School.
The Wattersons rush to the school by car, then they run to the library door. Nicole tries to open it, but it's locked.
Gumball says: "Noooo!"
Gumball says: "It's locked!"
Gumball says: "My reputation is ruined!"
Nicole says: "No, not yet."
Nicole says: "Quick!"
Nicole says: "Someone make me angry."
Richard says: "Uhhh..."
Richard says: "I taped a wrestling match over our wedding video?"
Nicole says: "Rrrrrrrrgggghhhh!"
Nicole says: "Unh!"
Nicole says: "I'm out of contro-o-o-o-l!"
Gumball, Darwin, Anais and Richard run along the library, when Felix, dressed as a wizard, appears in their way.
Felix says: "Thou shalt not pass!"
Richard says: "You've crossed the wrong wizard, young man!"
Richard says: "I am level 40!"
Richard says: "Let the battle commence!"
Richard and Felix roll their dice.
Felix says: "Hurrah!"
Felix says: "I get the first shot."
Felix says: "Meteor sword!"
Richard says: "Eugh!"
Richard says: "Ah!"
Richard says: "Ooh!"
Richard says: "Eh!"
Richard says: "He's good, but I can't afford to lose."
Richard says: "Magic missile!"
Felix says: "Doinggg!"
Felix says: "Deflected by the Shield of Rampor!"
Richard and Felix roll their dice again.
Richard says: "Uh!"
Richard says: "You'll have to go on without me."
Richard says: "I'm stuck for the next two turns."
Gumball, Darwin and Anais pass by.
Gumball says: "Come on!"
Gumball says: "The computer's just up ahead!"
A robot noise is heard.
Darwin says: "Watch out!"
The noise is getting louder.
The noise turns out to be from Bobert.
Gumball says: "Relax."
Gumball says: "It's only Bobert."
Gumball says: "I can take him."
Bobert says: "Initiating combat mode."
Anais says: "Don't worry, guys."
Anais says: "I got this."
Gumball says: "What are you doing?"
Anais says: "Leave it to me."
Anais says: "Just go around him."
Gumball says: "Are you sure you're gonna be okay?"
Anais says: "Don't worry."
Anais says: "The power of physics has never failed me yet!"
Bobert slowly steps toward Anais, but Anais zaps him in the leg, causing him to fall unconscious.
Gumball says: "The computer!"
Gumball says: "This is our chance to stop the upload."
Computer says: "Thirty seconds to completion."
Colin appears, holding a ruler.
Darwin says: "There's a guard!"
Darwin says: "That guy looks pretty dangerous."
Gumball says: "What are we gonna do?"
Darwin says: "Leave it to me."
Darwin says: "Come on, punk."
Colin says: "Huh?"
Darwin says: "Let's dance."
Colin says: "Such grace!"
Colin says: "The rhythm..."
Colin says: "must..."
Colin says: "synchronize!"
Gumball says: "Thanks, buddy."
Computer says: "Five seconds to completion."
Gumball says: "Yes!"
Gumball says: "My reputation is safe."
Computer says: "Four seconds 'til completion."
Ocho grabs Gumball's head, Gumball screams and attempts to grab the mouse.
Computer says: "Three seconds."
Computer says: "Two seconds."
Computer says: "One second 'til completion."
Computer says: "Upload complete."
Gumball says: "Nooooooooooo!"
Computer says: "Sending to all school contacts."
Colin says: "My name is Gumball Trisha Watterson."
Colin says: "That's right, Trisha is my middle name, and I was born without eyebrows and have to draw them on every day."
Colin says: "On hot days I smell like pate and teachers are advised not to mention it."
Colin says: "Also, I have a glandular problem that causes—"
Gumball says: "Okay!"
Gumball says: "Okay."
Gumball says: "You win."
Gumball says: "I'll join your club."
Colin says: "Are you kidding?"
Colin says: "Have you seen your school record?"
Gumball says: "Great."
Gumball says: "Rejected by The Reject Club!"
In the Car.
Scene cuts to the highway.
Gumball says: "Well, that's my reputation ruined until college."
Anais says: "No, it isn't."
Anais says: "I counter-hacked the main school server and rerouted the e-mail before it got to anyone."
Gumball says: "Oh, thank you, sis."
Darwin says: "Don't worry."
Darwin says: "We'll always be there for you."
Anais says: "You're part of the Watterson club..."
Anais says: "Trisha."
Gumball says: "Yeah, and whose great idea was that?"
Richard says: "What's wrong with it?"
Richard says: "It's short for "Tristopher."
Nicole says: "Richard, I thought we agreed on "Christopher."
Richard says: "Christopher, Tristopher, same thing, right?"
Darwin says: "So, what shall we do with these guys?"
The Reject Club members are shown to be tied up and their mouths are covered with handkerchiefs.
Nicole says: "Well, I think the responsible thing to do would be to drive them home and tell their parents what they've done."
The Reject Club shakes their heads in disagreement.
Darwin says: "No?"
Darwin says: "Then how about we spray you in honey and drop you off in the bear cage at the zoo?"
The Reject Club, again, disagrees to the idea.
Gumball says: "Okay, maybe you'd prefer to be dropped off naked at the mall?"
The Reject Club considers the idea, then nods their heads.
Gumball says: "All those in favor, say "aye."
Darwin says: "Aye!"
Anais says: "Aye!"
Richard says: "Aye!"
Nicole says: "Aye!"
Gumball says: "Motion carried!"
