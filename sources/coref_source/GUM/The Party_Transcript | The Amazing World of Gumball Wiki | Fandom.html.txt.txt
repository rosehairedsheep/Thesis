Students says: "A date?!"
Students says: "!"
Rachel​​​​​​​ says: "Uh-huh."
Rachel walks off then pops back in.
Rachel​​​​​​​ says: "Good luck!"
The students look at the camera, all in horror, apart from Darwin who is confused. Then, everyone but Darwin runs off screaming. Darwin eyes the rest, then looks back bewildered.
Darwin says: "What's a date?"
Darwin says: "Hey!"
Darwin says: "What's a date?"
Miss Simian appears behind a closed classroom door.
Lucy Simian says: "Hmm..."
Lucy Simian says: "A secret house party, eh?"

Date Options.
At the cafeteria, Gumball and Darwin are sitting at a table, with Gumball looking around the room marking a list of dates he could bring at the party.
Gumball says: "All right, buddy, let's make a list of possible dates."
Darwin says: "What's a date?"
Gumball says: "Yeeeah..."
Gumball says: "thanks?"
Darwin says: "Hey!"
Darwin says: "What about Penny?"
Gumball says: "Aw, Penny?"
Gumball looks at Penny while she's holding her trail laughing. He sees her through a crush filter.
Gumball says: "Oh, no, no, no."
Gumball says: "I just like her as a friend."
Gumball's pupils are shaped like hearts and his tongue is hanging out.
Darwin says: "Why are your eyes shaped like hearts?"
Gumball says: "Allergies!"
Darwin says: "Oh."
Darwin says: "Well, what about Carrie?"
Carrie is shown eating a sandwich.
Gumball says: "Carrie..."
Gumball says: "She's got spirit..."
A piece of sandwich falls off Carrie's body onto the floor, Carrie is shocked.
Gumball says: "I'll put her in the "maybes"."
Gumball says: "Next."
Teri is shown laughing.
Gumball says: "Teri."
Gumball says: "Nicely drawn features..."
Teri turns her face to the right, making herself nearly invisible.
Gumball says: "But a little flat."
Gumball says: "I'll put her in the "possiblies"."
Gumball says: "Hmmm..."
Carmen is shown reading a science book.
Gumball says: "Carmen."
Gumball says: "Prickly, but smart."
Gumball says: "Interesting."
Gumball says: "Umm, Sussie..."
Sussie is shown chewing with her mouth open while Masami and Penny look at her nonchalantly.
Gumball says: "No."
A paper plane suddenly appears and lands on the green food.
Darwin says: "What's that?"
Gumball says: ""Would you be the jelly in my peanut butter sandwich?"
Gumball says: "" Mmm..."
Gumball imagines two slices of bread with peanut butter but without jelly.
Imaginary Bread says: "What do you say, Gumball?"
Gumball says: "Nah."
Gumball says: "No, thanks."
Gumball says: "I already ate."
Gumball says: "All right buddy, it's date-time!"
A Very Bad Flirter.
The scene transitions to the school hallway with a rainbow-heart animation. Gumball walks up to Masami while she's talking to Teri.
Gumball​ says: "Hey Masami, wanna be my date?"
Gumball​ says: "You're not really my type 'cuz I usually like attractive girls, but hey, beggars can't be choosers."
Masami gets angry and turns stormy.
Gumball says: "You are a girl, right?"
Masami is still angry.
Gumball says: "What?"
Masami strikes Gumball with lightning and flies away. Gumball screams and coughs.
Gumball says: "How about you, Teri?"
Gumball says: "You look desperate."
Teri gasps, insulted, and swings her hand in front of Gumball, touching his face lightly.
Gumball says: "Was that a slap?"
Gumball says: "Uh, ouch?"
Sussie walks by.
Gumball says: "Ahhh!"
Gumball says: "Hey, Sussie, it's your lucky day, you're my date for the party."
Gumball says: "What do you say?"
Sussie burps in Gumball's face and he gasps for air, she then walks away.
Banana Joe and Carmen pass by while holding hands.
Banana Joe says: "Haha!"
Banana Joe says: "Date fail!"
Banana Joe says: "Come on, Prickles, let's roll!"
Gumball sighs.
One Last Option.
The scene changes to the Wattersons' house, with the family having lunch at the table.
Richard says: "Oh cheer up, Gumball."
Richard says: "When I was your age, I needed a girl for a party and what I said to her was:  and twenty years later, we're still married."
Gumball says: "Aww, Dad, you make it sound so easy..."
Anais says: "Are you sure you've asked every girl in class?"
Darwin says: "You didn't ask Penny."
Gumball says: "Penny?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "She's too hot."
Gumball says: "NOT-not hot, n—"
Gumball says: "hot..."
Gumball says: "my type, not my type!"
Gumball says: "Hehehe..."
Shot cuts to a ketchup doodle of Penny on Gumball's plate.
Anais says: "Well, if it's not Penny, there's still one girl you haven't asked."
Gumball says: "Really?"
Gumball says: "Who?"
Anais stares at him.
Gumball says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "Her."
Anais gives Gumball the phone and he talks on it outside of the kitchen.
Gumball says: "Hi, this is Gumball Watterson calling."
Gumball says: "Would you be my date to the party?"
Gumball says: "Uh no, you weren't exactly the first girl I asked but..."
Gumball says: "No-no-no-no-no-no, don't hang up!"
Gumball says: "Please, I can beg."
Gumball kneels down.
Darwin, Anais, Nicole, and Richard laugh softly.
Darwin, Anais, Nicole, and Richard run back into their seats, while Darwin falls for a split second then flips back up to his seat.
Gumball says: "Yesss!"
Gumball says: "See Darwin?"
Gumball says: "No girl can resist me."
Gumball's Date.
The scene cuts to Richard driving the kids to the party.
Richard says: "I'm so proud of you."
Richard says: "My baby boy is becoming a man."
Gumball says: "Yeah!"
Gumball says: "Keep it together, dad."
Richard says: "It seems like only yesterday we were watching "Daisy The Donkey" together."
Gumball says: "Dad, that was yesterday."
Richard says: "Well, it feels like a long time ago."
Richard says: "And look at you now, dating a girl!"
Camera zooms out, revealing Tina on the back seat, sticking out her tongue.

Penny says: "Hey."
Darwin says: "Hello."
Gumball says: "Hi, Penny!"
Penny says: "Yeah, hi, Gumball."
Gumball says: "So..."
Gumball says: "I didn't realize you were coming with Hector."
