Darwin says: "She said she'd rather skip it."
Gumball says: "But, she's a ghost."
Gumball says: "That's like saying Mr."
Gumball says: "Small would miss out on a, psychic crystal convention—"
Mister Small​​​​​​​ says: "Where?!"
Mister Small​​​​​​​ says: "!"
Gumball says: "Uh..."
Darwin says: "Did you tell him all that with your mind?"
Gumball says: "No."
Darwin says: "Then what did you tell him?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, it's not appropriate to say out loud."
They are now at Carrie's house. Gumball is repeatedly knocking her door with the knocker.
Darwin says: "Uh, dude."
Darwin says: "When someone doesn't answer the door, it means they're either busy or not in."
Gumball says: "No, it means you didn't knock loud enough."
Carrie's head phases through the door.

Carrie says: "dinner!"
Gumball says: "You're a ghost, you don't eat."

Gumball says: "I mean, there's candy, and costumes—"
Darwin says: "And candy—"
Carrie says: "On my point exactly, Halloween is supposed to be for the ghosts and ghouls of Elmore."
Carrie says: "It's going to be scary, but it's not anymore."
Gumball says: "Well, sure it is!"
Carrie says: "I don't mean how frightening your dental hygiene is after illegal amounts of candy."
Darwin says: "What do you mean—"
Darwin says: "Uh..."
Gumball says: "Well, what do all the ghosts and ghouls do on Halloween?"
Carrie says: "Well, they're still around trying to scare people, but it's way harder these days."
Carrie says: "Come, I'll show you."
She starts to float away, but then sees them with eyes closed, knees bent and holding up their right hands.
Carrie says: "Wait, what are you doing?"
Gumball says: "Aren't you going to take us by the hand and fly us to see the Halloweens that have been and the Halloweens that are yet to come?"
Carrie says: "No, we're going across the street."
Tobias and Banana Joe are seen receiving candy from Judith.
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "Thanks!"
Banana Joe says: "Thanks!"
Carrie says: "And if you can't cross the road without holding someone's hand, then maybe you shouldn't be out this late."
Mr. Candy.
Tobias and Banana Joe walk away from the Fitzgerald's house.
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "Dude, you know how we can get more candy without trick or treating?"
Banana Joe says: "We plant some, and harvest it next fall!"
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "No, there's an urban legend that you can summon Mr."
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "Candy."
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "All you gotta do is say his name three times."
Banana Joe says: "Sweet!"
Banana Joe says: "I'm in."
They get ready to summon Mr. Candy.
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "Candy, Candy, Candy!"
Banana Joe says: "Candy, Candy, Candy!"
A flash of light and a loud thunder like sound is heard to their right. Mr. Candy is seen standing there with a pose surrounded by bees.
Mr. Candy says: "They will taste my sweet revenge!"
Mr. Candy says: "Huh?"
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "Eh?"
Banana Joe says: "Eh?"
Mr. Candy says: "What?"
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "We want candy!"
Banana Joe says: "We want candy!"
Mr. Candy says: "Well I don't have any."
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "But you're supposed to bring us candy!"
Mr. Candy says: "No, if you summon me, I'm supposed to exact a terrible revenge upon you for my unjust end!"
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "And then give us candy?"
Mr. Candy says: "No!"
Mr. Candy says: "And if you don't mind, I was in the middle of something!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Candy, Candy, Candy!"
Banana Joe says: "Candy, Candy, Candy!"
Mr. Candy says: "What?!"
Mr. Candy says: "!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Yeah, do you know anyone who does give out candy?"
Mr. Candy says: "No!"
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Candy, Candy, Candy!"
Banana Joe says: "Candy, Candy, Candy!"
Mr. Candy says: "I got half a breath mint."
Mr. Candy says: "Take that and leave me alone."
Tobias​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You really don't live up to your name man."
Mr. Candy screams in frustration and materializes away once again. Gumball, Darwin and Carrie appear behind a nearby bush.
Gumball says: "He's kinda got a point."
Gumball says: "The name is quite misleading."
Darwin says: "Maybe he should call himself Mr."
Darwin says: "Angry Bee Head."
Carrie says: "Come on."
Carrie says: "Let me show you something else."
Fingernails Ghoul.
A scared Hank is seen in a factory running. As he turns a corner, a figure in a hat advances forward, laughing evilly. Hank soon runs to a pair of iron doors.

The figure's shadow can be seen moving towards him as he raises one of his sharp finger-nailed hands and places it on Hank's right shoulder, laughing menacingly in a demonic voice.
Hank says: "I'm sorry, it won't happen again—"
Hank says: "huh?"
Hank says: "Who are you?"
Figernails ghoul says: "Your worst nightmare!"
Figernails ghoul says: "Wait, you're not scared of me?"
Hank says: "No, not really."
Fingernails ghoul says: "But..."
Fingernails ghoul says: "you were running away from me."
Hank says: "No, I was running because I was going to be l..."
Hank says: "ate."
He looks down and sees himself wearing only underwear at his bottom half Ugh, it's another work dream.
George and Steve are then seen laughing at Hank while he covers himself. The fingernails ghoul sighs, then snaps his fingers, ending the dream.
Hank says: "So, uh, what are you doing here?"
Fingernails ghoul says: "I'm here to haunt nightmares."
Fingernails ghoul says: "What are you most scared of?"
Hank says: "Well, I still got nineteen years to pay my mortgage, that's a little daunting."
Fingernails ghoul says: "Ooh, house repayments, foreclosure—"
Fingernails ghoul says: "Ugh, anything else scarier?"
Hank says: "Well, I do worry that my talent won't live up to my expectations."
Fingernails ghoul says: "Oh come on, how am I supposed to show that?"
Fingernails ghoul says: "Whatever happened to bats and snakes?"
Fingernails ghoul says: "Oh."
Fingernails ghoul says: "Air holes."
Fingernails ghoul says: "I got a toad."
Hank says: "Hmm, nah."
Hank says: "I'm good."
The Fingernails Ghoul sighs and sits on the bed again.
Hank says: "Well,  I'm quite tired and I've got work in the morning and—"
Fingernails ghoul says: "Yeah yeah, I know, afraid you're gonna be late."
Hank says: "Uhh..."
Hank says: "There, there, buddy."
Gumball, Darwin and Carrie are seen watching outside the window.
Carrie says: "See?"
Carrie says: "No one's scared anymore."
Gumball says: "I don't know, I think it'd be pretty scary if he blew his nose."
Gumball says: "Yep, there it is."
Darwin says: "But isn't it weird spying on people like this?"
Leonard Daniels says: "No."
Leonard is then seen sitting on a nearby tree branch, using a pair of binoculars to see into the distance.
Leonard Daniels says: "It's only weird if you make it weird."
Gumball says: "See?"
Gumball says: "There are some scary things on Halloween night."
Carrie says: "That's not what I meant."
She flies to them both and they all teleport away again.

She presses a button on the VHS player and the tape starts rewinding. As the television is filled with static making a whirring noise, the three wait in silence. A long pause. Leslie and Alan look at each other then back to the screen. They continue to wait.

Cuts to Rocky running across a parking lot, looking back nervously. As he reaches the Elmore Gym, he looks back and sees the shadowy figure walking towards him. He then pulls out a key card and starts swiping the lock. After his second try, the door slides open and he rushes in. Inside, he pushes a treadmill across the room. When he sees the shadow figure walk closer to him, he braces himself. However, the figure walks onto the treadmill and stays walking there while the treadmill is on. Rocky sighs in relief.

Gumball says: "Where do I sign?"
Cuts to the inside of the Wattersons' house. A frightened Gumball and Darwin burst in as sirens can be heard outside and there is fire.

Gumball says: "Ahh!"

Darwin says: "This is all I can get!"
Gumball says: "Well, that's gonna have to do, 'cause I don't think we're ever gonna be able to leave this house again!"
Gumball pulls open the curtains as they look outside. There is chaos and fire everywhere, and all the ghouls, including Carrie, are chasing, scaring and holding onto frightened civilians, and a gigantic monster is at the distance destroying helicopters. As Gumball and Darwin watch, the clown suddenly pops up behind them.
Clown says: "Thanks, guys!"
