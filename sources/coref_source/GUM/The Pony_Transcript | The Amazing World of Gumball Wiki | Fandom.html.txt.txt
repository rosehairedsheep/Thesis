The Worst DVD Ever.
The episode starts at the Ripley 2000 store, with a line of people including Quattro, Sarah, Ocho, Pantsbully, Mr. Poop, Newspaper Employee, and Carrie, all looking impatient. Gumball and Darwin are at the front of the line, trying to pay for their DVD, but an invisible wall prevents Gumball from handing over the DVD to Larry.
Larry says: "What is wrong with you this time?"
Gumball says: "This movie is so sucky that my body refuses to rent it."
Larry says: "Then don't rent it and get outta here."
Gumball says: "I can't, I promised my sister."
Darwin says: "Give me that."
Gumball hands over the DVD to Darwin who then takes a deep breath and runs towards Larry, but an invisible force field repels him to the floor.
Darwin says: "You're right, this film is so bad that every atom in my body refuses to pay to see it."
Carrie says: "A Pony's Tail?!"
Carrie says: "!"
Carrie says: "Wow."
Carrie says: "Okay, I'm gonna rent this for you or we're gonna be here all day."
Carrie says: "Maybe if I hide it between my good films, my mind will be tricked."
Gumball says: "Carrie!"
Darwin says: "Carrie!"
Gumball says: "Carrie!"
Darwin says: "Carrie!"
Gumball says: "Carrie!"
Darwin says: "Carrie!"
Gumball says: "Carrie!"
Darwin says: "Carrie!"
Carrie tries to push her DVDs through the invisible force field.
Carrie says: "It's not working!"
Gumball says: "Come on, Carrie!"
Carrie manages to push the DVD through and causes a big blue flash of light. Afterwards, the trio walk out of the store.
Carrie says: "You know, there are easier ways to hurt your eyes."
Carrie says: "You could pour salt in them while you stare at the sun, for example."
Gumball says: "I'm sorry, Carrie."
Gumball says: "It's just I promised Anais we'd do something she wanted today."
Darwin says: "We didn't realize how unbearable it'd be, and we haven't even watched it yet."
Gumball says: "Come on, we're already late."
Gumball and Darwin run off-screen.
Helping a Fat Man out of a Manhole.
Gumball and Darwin stops at a pedestrian crossing.
Gumball says: "Oh, man."
Gumball says: "We're gonna get the face when we get home."
Darwin says: "What?"
Darwin says: "This one?"
Gumball says: "No, that's silent fury."
Gumball says: "What we're going to get is "I know you let me down"."
Darwin says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "That's it."
Gumball says: "But don't forget the slow head shake."
Darwin starts shaking his head slowly.
Darwin says: "I can handle that, as long as we don't get the "you mean nothing to me" back turn."
The traffic light changes to the green walking man, so Gumball and Darwin start running across the road.
Gumball says: "Don't worry, as long as nothing gets in our way, we'll be fine."
The scene changes to a row of stores where a blue repairman is working on a truck next to an open manhole; Tony is jogging along, but falls and gets stuck in the manhole in front of Gumball and Darwin. They stop beside him, then everybody looks at the teal tow truck driver.
Teal Tow Truck Driver says: "..."
Teal Tow Truck Driver says: "What?!"
Teal Tow Truck Driver says: "!"
Darwin says: "Uhhh, don't you think you should help that guy?"
Darwin says: "You clearly took the cover off."
Teal Tow Truck Driver says: "So?"
Teal Tow Truck Driver says: "You guys are way closer, that means it's your problem."
Tony says: "Uhh, can I get a little help here?"
Gumball says: "Listen, man, we'd love to help, but we're kind of in a hurry."
Tony says: "Well, I'm kind of in a manhole."
Tony says: "What, fat?!"
Tony says: "!"
Darwin says: "No."
Tony says: "Voluptuous?!"
Tony says: "!"
Tony says: "Flesh-ripped?!"
Tony says: "!"
Tony says: "Horizontally tall?!"
Tony says: "!"
Darwin says: "DISTRACTED!"
Darwin says: "I WAS GONNA SAY "DISTRACTED"!"
Darwin says: "I think you're a beautiful man."
Gumball says: "Still, what kind of bozo runs around not looking where he's going, blindly texting on his phone?"
Tony says: "I wasn't texting, I was updating my status so everyone knows I'm jogging."
Gumball says: "Why?"
Tony says: "To get those little thumbs-ups on ElmorePlus."
Gumball says: "Alright, let's get you out of here, you attention hog."
Darwin says: "Heeeey!"
Darwin says: "You're doing the face, aren't you?"
Anais says: "Why are you late?!"
Anais says: "!"
Gumball can be seen tying Martin with rope to a truck in the background.
Anais says: "No need to lie."
Anais says: "It's obvious you guys don't wanna watch the movie with me."
Darwin says: "Oh, no, that's not true."
Darwin says: "I can't wait to watch  Sorry, I didn't mean to say that."
Darwin says: "It's just that my brain refuses to let me lie about this film."
Anais says: "Just hurry up, okay?"
Scene cuts to Martin and Gumball waiting for the truck to move.
Tony says: "Uh, are you sure this is a good ide-AH!"
Gumball says: "There."
Gumball says: "Whose problem is it now?"

Darwin says: "Dude!"
Darwin says: "We need to get home!"

Rob​​​​​ says: "Gumball!"
Rob​​​​​ says: "Darwin!"
Rob​​​​​ says: "What's up, guys?!"
Rob​​​​​ says: "!"
Gumball says: "Heeeeeey..."
Gumball says: "Rich?"

Gumball says: "Ha!"
Gumball says: "Did I say "Rich"?"
Gumball says: "I'm-I'm sorry, dude."
Gumball says: "I meant, uh..."
Gumball says: "your name."
Rob​​​​​ says: "Which is?"
Gumball and Darwin laugh nervously.
Rob​​​​​ says: "Which is?!"

Both sigh. Darwin opens his mouth as if he remembers, but does not.
Rob​​​​​ says: "ROB!"
Rob​​​​​ says: "My name is Rob!"
Gumball says: "Rob!"
Gumball says: "Of course, man, I'm sorry."
Gumball says: "Hey listen, we're in a massive hurry, but we should totally hang out soon."
Gumball says: "I'll-I'll call you, bro."
Gumball and Darwin start to leave, but Rob blocks their path again.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You don't have my number."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You don't remember me at all, do you?"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "And this!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "This is just some hollow promise!"
Darwin says: "Dude, it's not that!"
Darwin says: "We've just been distracted because uh..."
Darwin says: "ha ha, the funniest thing just happened."
Darwin says: "See that hole?"
Rob leans over the manhole to look. Darwin kicks him down the hole.
Gumball says: "Darwin!"
Gumball says: "I can't believe you just did that!"
Darwin says: "Did what?"
Gumball says: "Uh..."
Gumball says: "I don't remember..."

Anais is in the Watterson's living room. She sighs, and suddenly sees Richard eating a slice of pizza. Richard sees her and "unchews" the pizza.
Anais says: "Dad, am I boring?"
Richard says: "Of course not, sweetie pie."
Anais says: "Then why don't Gumball and Darwin want to hang out with me?"
Richard says: "Uh..."
Richard says: "uh..."
Richard says: "The right thing!"
Anais says: "What?"
Richard says: "Speak to your mother!"
Sussie's Party.
Darwin running down the street, a tired Gumball following behind him.
Gumball says: "I gotta stop, man."
Gumball says: "I can't keep running like this."
Darwin says: "C'mon!"
Darwin says: "You can do it!"
Darwin says: "It's all in the mind!"
Gumball says: "You don't understand."
Gumball says: "My legs have given up."
Gumball says: "I even have a cramp in my bones."
Darwin says: "Your legs haven't given up!"
Darwin says: "You have!"
Gumball says: "You think?"
Gumball says: "You should try walking in my shoes for once."
Darwin says: "Is that a challenge?"
Scene cuts to Darwin's head on Gumball's legs and Gumball's torso on Darwin's legs.
Gumball says: "Whoah, dude!"
Gumball says: "Have you seen the top of your head?"
Gumball says: "You've got a birthmark in the shape of my face!"
Gumball says: "Oh, no, wait, your head is just very oily."
Darwin says: "Oh, yeah?"
Darwin says: "Well, your legs aren't legs!"
Darwin says: "They're just over-grown toes!"
Darwin says: "Give mine back!"
Both switch back to their original legs.
Darwin says: "Ah, this is so much better."
Darwin turns around and gasps.
Gumball says: "Sussie's birthday party!"
Both crawl on the sidewalk to pass by Sussie's house. A door is heard opening.
Sussie says: "Oh!"
Sussie says: "You came!"
Darwin says: "How did you know we were there?"
Sussie says: "I didn't."
Sussie says: "I was just practicing my guest welcome, but since you're here..."
Sussie says: "Oh!"
Sussie says: "You came!"

Gumball says: "Wow!"
Gumball says: "What a great party!"
Gumball says: "Yeah, it was really good, but we gotta go now."
Gumball says: "It's uh, it's getting dark and all."
Sussie's Father says: "Oh, c'mon, you're not gonna leave now!"
Sussie's Father says: "I haven't seen Sussie so happy."
Sussie starts laughing disturbingly.
Gumball says: "I'm sorry, but we need to get home to our little sister."
Gumball says: "Besides, no offense, sir, but if this party was a person, it would be Sussie."
Sussie's Father says: "Okay, let's cut to the chase."
Sussie's Father says: "I'll give you a thousand dollars if you stay."
