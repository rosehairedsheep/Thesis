Walking Down the Street.
Gumball and Darwin are walking down the street.
Gumball says: "I don't see the point of this."
Darwin says: "What?"
Gumball says: "Going for a Sunday walk, there's no payoff!"
Gumball says: "It's like having superpowers but no nemesis to fight."
Darwin says: "Is walking a superpower?"
Gumball says: "If having fun is your nemesis, then yes."
Darwin says: "Speaking of nemesis, what happened to that weird-looking guy who swore to be our mortal enemy?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, he was all like,  Cut to: nothing happens."
As Gumball and Darwin walk away, Rob appears behind them and puts a treadmill down. He takes out a car battery and attempts to slingshot it at them.
Gumball says: "I mean that's the problem with kids these days,  they just don't commit to anything."
Gumball says: "You know who I blame?"
Gumball says: "Overencouraging parents, medals for participation, and schools with no grades."
Rob attempts to cut down a telephone pole. As Gumball and Darwin walk closer, he rapidly chops the telephone pole.
Gumball says: "And as soon as they fail, they just give up."
Gumball says: "We can't call them losers  because they tried!"
Rob finishes chopping the pole, only for it to be suspended by the wires. He notices Gumball and Darwin, then jumps in a nearby bush.
Gumball says: "And you know what else I blame?"
Gumball says: "College degrees in graphic design and like, mime."
Gumball says: "Heh, that's what the world needs."
Gumball says: "More street artists who can use Shotofop."
Rob tries to launch the pole at Gumball and Darwin, but it hits a tree which falls right onto him. He tries to get up but the pole swings back and hits him in the face.
Gumball says: "I have two words for you: MILITARY KINDERGARTEN!"
Rob spills oil on the road and pushes a car down the slope. He cheers but slips.
Rob​​​​ says: "AHHHHH!"
Gumball says: "Something has to be done about it!"
Darwin says: "Dude, chill out!"
Darwin says: "Just breathe."
Gumball and Darwin take a deep breath and close their eyes. The car takes them to the other side of the road while Rob slides off-screen.
Rob​​​​ says: "AAAAHHHHH!"
Gumball says: "So, no, we won't see our nemesis again."
Gumball says: "Probably got into a new fad like being a blogger, riding a penny board or whatever."
Rob​​​​ says: "I'm trying, man, I'm trying to be your enemy!"
Darwin says: "Oh, hi, good to see you!"
Rob​​​​ says: "It's not supposed to be good to see me!"
Darwin says: "Aw, somebody needs a hug!"
Darwin tries to hug Rob, but he pushes him back, causing the oil to make Rob slide away.
Gumball says: "What was that?"
Rob​​​​ says: "It's the oil from the trap."
Darwin says: "What trap?"
Rob​​​​ says: "Just one of the five hundred and sixty-three traps I set for you guys!"
Rob​​​​ says: "Like this one!"
Rob​​​​ says: "Look, I don't think I’m capable."
Rob​​​​ says: "Just forget about me."
Rob​​​​ says: "Like everyone else has."
Rob starts walking but the oil makes him walk on the spot.
Rob​​​​ says: "Would you mind?"
Darwin pushes Rob, who slowly slides away.
Darwin says: "Should we go..."
Darwin says: "?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, all right."
Darwin says: "No!"
Darwin says: "I mean go after..."
Gumball says: "Yeah, I know."
Gumball says: "I was just messing with ya."
Darwin says: "Dude, come back!"
Gumball says: "We'll help you become so evil that you'll grow a goatee!"
A bit later, the three of them are seen riding a bus.
In the Bus.
Gumball says: "It's really sad that our nemesis rides the bus."
Rob​ says: "I can hear you."
Gumball says: "Yeah, well, I hoped you'd be nutty enough to ride around on a bike made out of human bones, but here you are taking the bus."
Gumball says: "Not even as scary as that weird cat lady!"
Gumball says: "No offense."
Alison says: "Don't listen to them, Martin, I know you're a real boy."
Martin meows angrily and scratches Alison's face.
Darwin says: "Maybe he would look more evil if he had an ominous theme tune."
Gumball says: "Dude, what's your name?"
Rob​ says: "Rob."
Gumball says: "Bob bob."
Darwin says: "Bob bob."
Gumball says: "Bada ba bob."
Darwin says: "Bada ba bob."
Gumball says: "Bob bob bob bob bob bob bob bob, bob bob bob bob bob bob bob bob, BADA BOB!"
Darwin says: "Bob bob bob bob bob bob bob bob, bob bob bob bob bob bob bob bob, BADA BOB!"
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "It's Rob!"
Gumball says: "Rob rob rob rob rob rob..."
Darwin says: "Rob rob rob rob rob rob..."
Rob shakes his head and covers his face with his hands.
Alison says: "I would have gone for something more like:  Robitous!"
Alison says: "Ominous!"
Alison says: "On the bus!"
Alison says: "Robitous ominous on the bus!"
Marvin says: "No, what about:  Rooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooob!"
Sussie says: "Eh, what about:  ROB!"
Everyone on the bus continues making noises, much to Rob's chagrin. The bus stops at the parking lot of the mall.
Rob leaves the bus in a huff.
Gumball says: "Rob!"
Gumball says: "Dude, Rob!"
Gumball says: "Rob!"
Gumball says: "Rob, come back!"
Gumball says: "Rob!"
In the Mall.
Cut to inside the mall, where Rob is seen sniffing some melons. Gumball gasps.
Gumball says: "That's it!"
Gumball says: "That's what he’s missing!"
Darwin says: "Melons?"
Gumball says: "No, he needs a villainous name like, "Dr."
Gumball says: "something."
Darwin says: "Dr."
Darwin says: "Fruity?"
Gumball says: "Meh."
Darwin says: "Dr."
Darwin says: "Dandruff?"
Gumball says: "Dr."
Gumball says: "Ethically-sourced-tuna-fish!"
Darwin says: "Dr."
Darwin says: "Jerky!"
Gumball says: "Dr."
Gumball says: "Moisturizer!"
Darwin says: "Dr."
Darwin says: "Old-man-reaching-for-a-jar-of-olives?"
Old man says: "Yes?"
Darwin says: "Never mind..."
Gumball and Darwin follow Rob out of the market.
Gumball says: "Come on, man, give us something to work with."
Darwin says: "How about Dr."
Darwin says: "Fuzz?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, or Dr."
Darwin says: "It’s more like Dr."
Gumball and Darwin keep making noises resembling static until Rob throws his groceries on the ground and starts screaming, stomping on them. Gumball then takes a really deep breath, and Rob stops freaking out, looking worried for him.
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "Are you ok?"
Gumball says: "Just having a eureka moment."
Gumball says: "What about..."
Gumball suddently looks like a superhero comic character with glowing eyes, as lightning strikes behind him.
Gumball says: "DR."
Gumball says: "WRECKER!"
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "I..."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "!"
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "I..."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "I like it."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "Dr."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "Wrecker!"
Gumball says: "We're gonna have to work on the voice."
Making a Nemesis.
Cut to the Wattersons' house. Gumball, Darwin and Rob are in the living room.
Gumball says: "Okay, try the British accent again."
Rob​​​​​​​​ says: "I will destroy ye and everyone ye love."
Gumball says: "Eh, sounds like a cat being strangled by another cat who's also being strangled."
Gumball says: "Underwater."
Gumball says: "Okay, hold on."
Gumball says: "Try again."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I will destroy you and everyone you love."
Gumball says: "Hold on, I need to adjust the bass."
Gumball says: "Okay, again."
Gumball says: "Sorry, sorry!"
Gumball says: "That was the volume!"
Gumball says: "Okay."
Gumball says: "Again?"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I will destroy you and everyone you love!"
Gumball and Darwin gasp in admiration and Rob looks at them happily.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I am Dr."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Wrecker, kneel before Dr."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Wrecker, Dr."
Gumball says: "Okay, calm down."
Gumball says: "Next we need to get you an outfit."
A sequence shows different pieces of armor appearing on Rob. It is interrupted by Gumball throwing a cardboard helmet at Rob, who is standing on the chair in Gumball and Darwin's room.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Ow!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "This is ridiculous, why do I have to get dressed like this?"
Gumball says: "Because you don't see villains spending ten minutes hopping on one foot, pushing their leg through their armored pants!"
Gumball says: "Come on, lower your head."
Gumball says: "Maybe you just put the helmet on yourself."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "No, that's not right."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Ha, ha, ha!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "No no no, still not right."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Ha ha ha ha!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "No, that's not good."
Darwin says: "Our evil baby's almost ready to go out into the big, wide world."
Gumball says: "And destroy it."
Darwin says: "This calls for a celebration!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Ah ha ha!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Ha ha ha!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "How did that sound?"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Guys?"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Guys!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Hello?"
Rob finds Gumball and Darwin, looking hunched and with yellow and creepy eyes.
Darwin says: "Happy evil day, master!"
Gumball says: "Happy evil day, master!"
The room is decorated with birthday supplies with skulls drawn over them and a "HAPPY EVIL DAY" banner. Rob takes a Daisy the Donkey paper plate with eyebrows, red eyes, and sharp teeth drawn on the face.
Gumball says: "I'm sorry, master."
Gumball says: "It was kind of hard to buy evil stuff online without ticking a box saying I was eighteen, so we had to improvise."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "What is all this?"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You think this is a game?"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You think that because you helped me find myself, I'm no longer your enemy?"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You think we’re friends?"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I am Dr."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Wrecker and before long, you will be wreck-tified!"
Darwin says: "What does that mean?"
Gumball says: "Doesn't really make sense."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Yes, I'm not 100% on the catchphrase yet."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "But this is what I do to your friendship!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Mark my words: I will destroy you and everyone you love!"
Gumball says: "Who would’ve thought in creating a monster, we'd create a monster?"
Wrecking Elmore.
At nighttime, Gumball is trying to comfort Darwin when the doorbell rings. They open the door.
Gumball says: "Oh, our little "friend" has come back to play."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I'm afraid it has become a little more serious than that."
Gumball says: "Wreck."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "-that it will wreck the whole of Elmore and everyone in it, but mostly you."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "And where better to wreak maximum damage than the Elmore dam?"
A flashback shows Rob sneaking into a closed area, where a sign reads "Elmore Dam".
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I knew if I wrecked the control room, the whole town would flood."
Rob knocks on a metal door in the flashback.
The flashback stops.
Gumball says: "Wait, you hired a wrecking ball?"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You bet!"
The flashback restarts. Rob smashes the wrecking ball into the wall beside the door, breaking it. He stands up.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You just got wrecked!"
The broken wall reveals a control panel with electricity and water coming out of it. The flashback stops.
Gumball says: "Stylish entrance, check."
Gumball says: "Global threat, check."
Gumball says: "Use of improved catchphrase, "you just got wrecked," check."
Gumball says: "The final category is getting away in style."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Ah, well, I was going to escape by bus."
Flashback shows Rob waiting at a bus stop.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I'm Dr."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Wrecker, no no, you just got wrecked."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I'm Dr."
Flashback fast-forwards from evening to night.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Then I realized it's Sunday, and the buses stop early on a Sunday."
The flashback ends.
Darwin says: "So, you need our help."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Yes."
Gumball says: "You never apologized for wrecking his cookies."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Did I mention the whole town is about to be wrecked?"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Because who cares about your cookies?!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "!"
Darwin says: "It was more than cookies!"
Darwin says: "You wrecked my feelings, young man!"
Gumball says: "It's one thing being a nemesis, it's another thing entirely being a bully!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Oh, for the love of- I'm sorry."
Gumball says: "I think if you were really sorry, you'd give him a hug."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Are you kidding?!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Ah."
Darwin says: "Mmm..."
Darwin says: "Okay, I forgive you."
Gumball says: "Then let's save the town!"
Rob 'runs' while heroic music plays, but it is quickly revealed he is sitting in a desk chair pushed by Gumball and Darwin.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Thanks, guys, you know this outfit pinches when I run."
Eventually, Gumball, Darwin and Rob make it to the closed area. Electricity sparks out of a control panel exposed by a hole in the wall.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Fix it, minions!"
Gumball says: "What do you mean "fix it?"
Gumball says: "" It's ruined."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Wrecked."
Darwin says: "Okay, okay, there should be a blue, a red, and a yellow wire."
Gumball says: "Uh-uh."
Darwin says: "Cut the yellow wire."
Gumball says: "Okay."
Darwin says: "No no no, wait!"
Gumball says: "What?"
Darwin says: "I have no credentials or diploma."
Darwin says: "It would be criminally stupid to listen to me."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Hurry up, there's only thirty seconds left."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I mean twenty-nine."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I mean twenty-eight."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I mean twenty-seven."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I mean twenty-six."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "I mean - we don't have time to lose!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Twenty seconds."
As Rob counts down, Gumball's hand gets closer and closer to the wires.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Seventeen."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Fifteen."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Fourteen."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Thirteen."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Twelve."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Eleven."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Ten."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Nine."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Eight."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Seven."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Six."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Five."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Four."
Gumball says: "I'm sorry, guys, I really don't feel like touching live electrical wires with my bare hands."
The control panel starts beeping.
Darwin says: "The dam is gonna burst!"
Gumball says: "This is where it ends!"
Darwin says: "Then it's important you know: I love you."
Gumball says: "And it's important that you know: I really love you."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "And now, we only have three, two, one..."
They huddle together, bracing themselves for the explosion. A can of soda is ejected and hits Gumball's head.
Gumball says: "Ow."
Darwin says: "Eh, I was expecting something more visually interesting."
Gumball looks over the wall. They were standing right behind a vending machine. Gumball removes the junk in front of the sign.
Gumball says: ""Elmore auto damage repair center?"
Darwin says: "Does Elmore even have a dam?"
Gumball says: "No."
Silence.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Well, this is awkward."
Darwin says: "Should we just leave?"
Gumball says: "Yes, let's go."
A Failed Nemesis.
On the way home, Rob throws his armor behind, looking depressed.
Gumball says: "Come on, man, there will be other opportunities to destroy us."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "What's the point?"
As they walk down the street, Gumball and Darwin notice the snare trap from earlier. They decide to walk right into it.
Darwin says: "Oh, no!"
Darwin says: "We got caught by Dr."
Darwin says: "Wrecker's trap!"
Gumball says: "He will probably leave us to hang here until our heads explode as he does his trademark evil laugh."
A confused Rob looks at Gumball, who smiles and gestures to him.
Rob​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ says: "You just got wrecked!"
Gumball says: "Good job, buddy."
Gumball says: "Now, do you mind getting us down?"
Gumball says: "Dude?"
Gumball says: "Seriously?"
Gumball says: "Please, Bob- I mean, Dr."
Gumball says: "Wrecker."
Gumball says: "Please come back!"
Episode ends.
