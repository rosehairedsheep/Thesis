Felicity says: "Oh, b-b-b-but..."
Felicity says: "uhhh, that sounds delicious!"
Bobert says: "Start by processing your proteins and carbohydrates, using your hyper-pulse laser."
Bobert fires his laser at all the ingredients, dicing them.
Bobert says: "Use your quantum beam to place the result in a heat-resistant item of cookware."
With a beam, Bobert gathers all the ingredients and drops them into a bowl.

Bobert says: "I used my atomic core to irradiate the surroundings."
Felicity says: "Ooh--is that safe?"

Bobert says: "For me."
Bobert says: "Then add more oil and the remaining ingredients."
Felicity says: "Just a second."
Felicity says: "I did not sign up for this!"
A hand grows on her finger.
Felicity says: "U-urgh!"
A feeding tube comes out of the food processor and attaches itself to her mouth. She lets out a muffled scream.
Bobert says: "Then begin the feeding process."
The food goes through the feeding tube all at once. Felicity swallows it forcefully and pulls off the tube.
Felicity says: "That was such a..."
Felicity says: "strong flavor!"
Felicity says: "What kind of oil was that?"
Bobert says: "Android oil."
Felicity says: "Oh, and what part of the world does it come from?"
Bobert says: "It is locally sourced."

Felicity says: "Very good!"

Narrator says: "This is Timmy."
His blurb says, "I baby talk the talk, and I crawl the walk.".
Narrator says: "This is Charlie-Ann."
Hers says, "And if I had to describe myself in one word it would be Charlie-Ann.".

She accidentally pushes the chair onto his foot and it gets stuck.

Narrator says: "We're here to tell you the story of a boy."
Narrator says: "A boy who was born different."
Narrator says: "Welcome to Everyday Heroes."
The title appears in a freeze frame. Fade to Ocho in the hall, opening his locker and walking down the hall.
Narrator says: "Ocho might look like the average Elmore High teenager, but life was not always this easy, for he was born with three pairs of legs."
Narrator says: "This was the story of the boy who had three butts."
Open on Ocho in the classroom, talking to the camera.
Ocho says: "I guess I..."
Ocho says: "."
Ocho says: "yeah, no, it's never been that easy, having three butts."
Ocho says: "Like, they don't really sell underwear for people with that many legs."
Ocho says: "So I have to buy black gloves, cut the fingers off, and poke another hole in them."
Cut to Ocho reading in the courtyard, his back turned to Leslie, Carmen, and Clayton, who are chatting and laughing. Ocho narrates over the next couple shots.
Ocho says: "I always worry about what the other kids will say behind my back, because, well, I've got a few of them."
Shots of Ocho on the school bus, and in the classroom, despondently watching Tobias and Bobert talking.
Ocho says: "Back in the day, people used to call me names like The Three Buttsketeers, they said I won the jack-butt, asked me if my toots sounded like a church organ..."
Back to Ocho in the classroom, talking to the camera.
Ocho says: "It made me kinda defensive."
Ocho says: "So, now I'm generally a bit tense."
Ocho says: "You gotta move on."
Ocho says: "It's like my mom says: two heads are better than one, and three butts are better than none."
Ocho says: "Which I guess is true."
One last shot of Ocho talking to the camera in the courtyard.
Ocho says: "Imagine if I had no butt."
Narrator says: "Join us next week for another inspiring story of everyday heroes: the mouth-breathing man."
Cut to the Doughnut Sheriff loudly mouth-breathing.

Rob​​​ says: "Okay, you!"
Rob​​​ says: "Give me a character that is optimistic, fun, and that all the children will love."
Timmy says: "Eh..."
Timmy says: "Okay, I think I got one!"
Timmy says: "He's a dog--you know some kind of Great Dane that can't speak properly, and he's got all these kooky friends who wear flare trousers, and they solve mysteries in a van."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Great!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​ says: "Then from now on, children, you should give up on Gumball, and watch this other guy!"
Timmy says: "Yeah, but..."
Timmy says: "isn't that on a different channel?"
Timmy says: "So..."
Rob​​​​​​​​​​ says: "No, no, no!!"
Rob​​​​​​​​​​ says: "WAIT!!!"
The camera switches off. Episode ends.
