Playing Galaktrek.
The episode starts with Gumball and Darwin playing on one of the computers in the school library.
Anais says: "Hey, are you two finally studying..."
Anais says: "or are you playing Corn Farm?"
Gumball says: "Ugh, neither."
Gumball says: "Because Corn Farm is for plebs who like to get ripped off spending real money on a virtual pig to go with their windmill."
Gumball says: "We're playing Galaktrek, and we're about to buy a virtual space hog to go with our solar generator."
Anais says: "What's the difference here?"
Explosions and pig squeals can be heard coming from the computer.
Gumball says: "Violence."
Darwin says: "Violence."
Gumball says: "Right, nothing new is happening here."
Gumball says: "We need to buy the photon blaster."
Darwin says: "But we can't!"
Darwin says: "We're out of cosmic points."
Darwin says: "Look out!"
Darwin says: "We're under attack!"
The computer shows their planet being destroyed.
Gumball says: "But who could be doing this?"
Tobias laughs evilly.
Gumball says: "Not now, Tobias."
Gumball says: "We're trying to figure out who's destroying our planet."
Tobias​​ says: "That what's my smug laugh was about."
Tobias​​ says: "It is I who is destroying your planet."
Tobias points to his screen, and then to theirs, displaying their planet exploding.
Gumball says: "W-T-W, dude?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "How did you get the hadron laser?"
Tobias​​ says: "I bought it."
Tobias​​ says: "For two million cosmic points."
Gumball says: "Two million cosmic points?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Tobias​​ says: "Which I bought for five dollars."
Gumball says: "Five dollars?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Tobias​​ says: "Which I bought for one good point."
Gumball says: "One good point?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Darwin says: "What are good points?"
Gumball says: "I don't know!"
Gumball says: "What are good points?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Tobias​​ says: "They're points I get for doing chores for my parents."
Gumball says: "Chores for your parents?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Tobias​​ says: "Yes?"
Gumball says: "Yes?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Tobias​​ says: "Okay..."
Tobias​​ says: "Well, I'm kinda busy with Galaktrek at the moment, so, uh, how about you do my chores for me, I give you the good points, and then you can buy whatever you want for the game."
Gumball says: "Hm."
Tobias​​ says: "Hello?"
Gumball says: "Sorry."
Gumball says: "I kinda peaked too early with excitement."
Gumball says: "Yeah, we'll do it."
The First Chore.
Gumball and Darwin are sneaking through the school hallway.
Darwin says: "Why do we have to break in here?"
Gumball says: "Because Tobias wants us to get him an A in science, and we're clearly not good enough."
Gumball gestures towards the door of the science lab; the hallway is filled with green fumes, and several students are passed out on the floor.
Gumball says: "So, we have to break into the teachers' office and change his grades directly on their computer."
Gumball shapes his finger into a paper clip, then unwinds it to pick the lock on the door.
Gumball says: "Aha!"
Darwin says: "But why are we breaking in here?"
Gumball says: "What do you mean?"
Gumball opens the door and sees Rocky spraying cheese fizz in his own mouth.
Darwin says: "Because this is the broom closet."
Gumball and Darwin enter the teachers' office.
Gumball says: "Shh!"
Gumball says: "Shh!"
Gumball continues scatting, then goes under the table, tipping a vase off of it. Darwin gasps, then catches the vase and sighs with relief. Gumball screams loudly, causing Darwin to drop the vase and break it.
Gumball says: "Shh!"
Gumball says: "Right."
Gumball says: "All I have to do is initiate the power supply to the hard drive and engage the mainframe protocol."
Darwin says: "How?"
Gumball turns on the computer.
Darwin says: "Good."
Darwin says: "Now find the Tobias file."
Gumball opens the file.
Gumball says: "Darn."
Gumball says: "It's a PFD, we can't edit it."
Darwin says: "What are we gonna do?"
Gumball says: "Pass me that crayon."
Gumball draws a line on the screen to make the "F" look like an "A.".
Gumball says: "Mmm-hmm."
Darwin says: "Mmm-hmm."
Cut to Tobias, who is now pale and looks sleep-deprived playing Galaktrek in the library.
Tobias​​ says: "More, I need more..."
Tobias​​ says: "!"
Gumball says: "Mission accomplished!"
Tobias​​ says: "Oh, very good!"
Tobias​​ says: "Well, here are your good points."
Gumball says: "For real?"
Tobias​​ says: "Y-yeah?"
Gumball says: "OHH!"
Darwin says: "OHH!"
Gumball says: "WE JUST GOT PAID!"
Darwin says: "WE JUST GOT PAID!"
Gumball says: "Look at all this money!"
Gumball and Darwin hurriedly pick up the good points.
Tobias​​ says: "So, are you guys up for more work?"
Tobias​​ says: "'Cause I got plenty more for you!"
Gumball and Darwin gasp.
Tobias​​ says: "You missed one."
Darwin says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "Alright, but the price just went up."
Gumball says: "Now it's twenty invisible good points!"
Tobias​​ says: "Hmm, uh..."
Tobias​​ says: "Okay."
Darwin says: "And it's ten upfront!"
Darwin says: "The rest on delivery."
Darwin says: "We're no suckers."
Tobias​​ says: "Alright, alright."
Tobias​​ says: "You drive a hard bargain, young man."
After Tobias hands Darwin more invisible points, the sound of stretching elastic is heard as he puts the money away.
Tobias​​ says: "What was that?"
Darwin says: "I put the money in my invisible pants."
Tobias​​ says: "Right..."
Tobias​​ says: "Well, my dad wants the lawn taken care of."
Gumball says: "Hm, go on..."
Tobias​​ says: "As in, he wants the weeds taken out."
Gumball says: "Hm, go on..."
Tobias​​ says: "Th-that's it."
Tobias​​ says: "Take out the weeds."
Gumball says: "Go on."
Tobias​​ says: "I literally can't be any clearer."
Tobias​​ says: "You go on!"
Gumball says: "Okay."
Tobias sighs and goes back to playing Galaktrek.
Doing More Chores.
In front of Tobias' house, Gumball sprays the grass with herbicide, killing it.
Darwin says: "What are you doing?"
Gumball says: "I'm killing the weeds."
Darwin says: "Are you kidding me?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Darwin says: "He explained six times that he wanted his lawn taken care of, not taken out!"
Gumball says: "Well, he never specifically said the grass had to grow back."
Darwin says: "Fair point."
Darwin says: "You did give him plenty of opportunities to be more specific."
Darwin takes the herbicide and sprays it. Later, Gumball and Darwin are seen in the school library, rolling on the floor laughing.
Darwin says: "We're rich!"
Tobias​​ says: "When you guys are done rolling around in it, can you please get back to work?"
Tobias​​ says: "I'm under attack here!"
Gumball says: "Wow, dude."
Gumball says: "How did you get the galactic exoskeleton?"
Tobias​​ says: "Doesn't matter!"
Tobias​​ says: "Listen, I need you guys to wax my..."
Tobias​​ says: "dad-  Sorry, I've been playing this game for thirty-eight hours, so I'm starting to train my lose of thought."
Gumball says: "What?"
Tobias​​ says: "You heard me."
Tobias​​ says: "On get with it!"
Gumball and Darwin are in front of Tobias' house, waxing the car with hair removal wax.
Darwin says: "You have to admit, it's kinda weird to ask us to wax a car."
Gumball says: "Hey, man, we're labor, not management."
Gumball says: "Sorry, this might hurt a little."
Gumball goes under the car and waxes it from underneath. Back to the library, an exhausted Tobias hands good points to Gumball.
Tobias​​ says: "..."
Tobias​​ says: "forty-nine, and fifty."
Gumball says: "Dude, are you feeling okay?"
Gumball says: "You look like a crab without a shell."
Tobias​​ says: "I'd like to see what you'd look like if you got breakfast, lunch, and dinner from a vending machine."
Tobias​​ says: "I got more work for you."
Darwin says: "Uh, I think we have enough invisible money, thank you."
Tobias​​ says: "Maybe you'll change your mind when you get a load of this."
Tobias opens an empty briefcase as Gumball and Darwin watch in awe.
Tobias​​ says: "Oh, yeah."
A montage shows Gumball and Darwin performing chores poorly as Tobias' state deteriorates. In the library, Tobias signs an invisible check and hands it to Gumball.
Gumball says: "Uh-uh-uh!"
Gumball says: "Cash only."
Tobias sighs and walks towards a bookshelf.
Gumball says: "What's that?"
Tobias​​ says: "Invisible ATM."
Gumball says: "Oooh."
Darwin says: "Oooh."
Tobias​​ says: "Do you mind?"
They look away as Tobias "types" his PIN. Gumball and Darwin are then seen doing more chores.
Gumball says: "Hey!"
Gumball says: "We're done."
Tobias grunts and throws invisible money at them.
Gumball says: "High five?"
Tobias makes a weak attempt to high five Gumball, then shoos them. The brothers resume their chores, and, unknown to them, Tobias' house catches fire.
Telling the Truth.
Gumball and Darwin return to the library once again.
Gumball says: "We would like to redeem our good points, please."
Tobias, who looks extremely sleep-deprived, snarls.
Darwin says: "Sorry, could you repeat that?"
Tobias​​​​ says: "That's not gonna be possible."
Gumball says: "What?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Why?"
Tobias​​​​ says: "I used my parents' credit card to buy stuff in the game, and I used you to do chores and gain an advance on my good points."
Tobias​​​​ says: "But it's gotten out of control, I got tricked by Galaktrek – I bought every single end-game purchase possible."
Gumball says: "How much did you spend?"
Tobias​​​​ says: "Uh..."
Tobias​​​​ says: "numbers we haven't learned at school yet."
Gumball says: "Well, make one up so we can get an idea."
Tobias​​​​ says: "Um..."
Tobias​​​​ says: "A quadrillion dollars."
Gumball and Darwin gasp.
Darwin says: "But what about all those invisible good points you gave us?"
Tobias​​​​ says: "There never were any good points."
Tobias​​​​ says: "I switched the real ones for nothing but thin air."
Shocked, Gumball and Darwin remember all the times they played with the invisible money.
Gumball says: "Gosh, you're right!"
Gumball says: "There was nothing there all along!"
Darwin says: "You've hit rock bottom, man!"
Tobias​​​​ says: "Do you know what rock bottom is?!"
Tobias​​​​ says: "!"
Tobias​​​​ says: "Rock bottom is getting a kid to organize your mom's underwear drawer just so you can afford to buy your space cowboy a new umbrella!"
Darwin says: "If you don't redeem our good points, then we're gonna have to take this to the top."
Gumball says: "–the President of the United States of America."
Darwin says: "No, dude, his parents."
Darwin says: "Tobias' parents!"
Tobias​​​​ says: "I'm afraid I can't let you do that."
Tobias arms an invisible gun.
Gumball says: "What's that?"
Tobias​​​​ says: "My invisible shock rifle."
Tobias​​​​ says: "Remember?"
Tobias​​​​ says: "I bought all the weapons."
Gumball and Darwin run through the hallway as Tobias shoots in their direction.
Darwin says: "What are we gonna do?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Darwin says: "He's got lasers!"
Gumball says: "Maybe, but we have a laser copier."
Gumball jumps onto a laser copier and presses a button. A sheet of paper comes out of it.
Gumball says: "Yeah, I don't know why I thought that would work."
Darwin says: "The name makes it sound more hardcore than it is."
Gumball and Darwin start running again.
Tobias​​​​ says: "You think you can outrun me?"
Tobias​​​​ says: "Well, try to outrun my portal gun."
Tobias​​​​ says: "Darn, missed it."
Tobias​​​​ says: "Gotta cycle through again."
Tobias switches to his portal gun, then shoots a portal above Gumball and another one underneath him, causing him to fall through an infinite loop.
Gumball says: "Darwin!"
Darwin and Tobias fight for the gun, sending Gumball flying in various directions until he bumps into them.
Darwin says: "Quick!"
Darwin says: "His parents are only two blocks down!"
Tobias​​​​ says: "It'll look much further after I've used my shrink gun."
Tobias shoots, causing Gumball and Darwin to scream as they shrink. He then prepares to stomp them, but is interrupted by a confused Anais.
Anais says: "What are you doing?"
Cut to reality, where Gumball and Darwin have not really been shrunken by the shrink gun. Gumball is seen holding Tobias' foot while crouched down with his feet tucked into his shirt. Darwin is on his knees, and his knees are in his shoes.
Gumball says: "Tobias robbed us of our invisible points and shrunk us with a space gun because we were gonna tell his parents."
Gumball says: "Help us!"
Anais says: "I might not be a qualified psychiatrist, but I'll try anyway."
Anais says: "You do realize that none of this is real, right?"
Gumball says: "You know what that means?"
Anais says: "Yes, you can stop acting like a loon and walk normally down the road to Tobias' house."
Gumball says: "No."
Gumball says: "It means we can imagine any weapon we want as well!"
They run again. Anais, frustrated over how Gumball realizes the solution, sighs and walks away.
Gumball says: "Darwin, quick!"
Gumball says: "Think of something awesome!"
Darwin says: "Huh..."
Darwin says: "aha!"
Gumball says: "What is it?"
Darwin says: "A stick."
A laser beam shot by Tobias grazes Gumball and Darwin.
Gumball says: "You're gonna need to think of something much bigger."
Darwin throws an invisible object at Tobias, crushing him.
Gumball says: "What was that?"
Darwin says: "A much bigger stick."
Tobias catches up with Gumball and Darwin, who readied their invisible guns.
Tobias​​​​ says: "No..."
Tobias​​​​ says: "How did you get the flak cannon and the railgun?"
Gumball says: "The question is: how are you gonna survive them?"
Gumball and Darwin fire at Tobias in slow motion, "killing" him. They then slowly approach a "dying" Tobias.
Tobias​​​​ says: "Come closer."
Tobias​​​​ says: "Closer..."
Tobias places something in Gumball's hand.
Gumball says: "What is it?"
Tobias​​​​ says: "Pin."
Gumball says: "Pin for what?"
Tobias​​​​ says: "Plasma grenade."
Tobias holds up an invisible grenade; Gumball and Darwin attempt to run away, but they are caught in the imaginary explosion, but they soon come to a strict halt by the voice of Harold.
Harold​​​​ says: "Hey!"
Tobias​​​​ says: "Sorry, but we're in the middle of a plasma explosion here?"
Harold​​​​ says: "No, you're not."
Harold​​​​ says: "I just had to block my credit card after you spent fifteen thousand dollars on made-up video game weapons!"
Harold​​​​ says: "They've closed your game account!"
Tobias​​​​ says: "Oh."
Gumball and Darwin flop onto the ground.
Harold​​​​ says: "Get in the house."
Harold​​​​ says: "What the..."
Harold​​​​ says: "?"
They all turn to the house, which is on fire.
Harold​​​​ says: "What happened?!"
Harold​​​​ says: "!"
Darwin says: "Sorry, sir."
Darwin says: "We were doing Tobias' chores for good points."
Harold​​​​ says: "And how are you gonna pay for the damage?"
Gumball says: "Do you take any currency?"
Harold​​​​ says: "I guess."
Harold​​​​ says: "What choice do I have?"
Gumball says: "Very well."
Darwin says: "Oh, that's a five."
Gumball says: "–twenty-five Watterson dollars—"
The episode ends.
