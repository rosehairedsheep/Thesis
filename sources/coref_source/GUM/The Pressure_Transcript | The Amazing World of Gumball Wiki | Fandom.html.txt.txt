The Boyfriend Game.
Molly, Carmen, Carrie, Teri, Penny, Masami and Leslie are inside Molly's new treehouse.
Molly says: "So what do you think of my treehouse, girls?"
All except Masami nod and cheer.
Leslie​​​​ says: "I love what you've done with the bathroom."
The "bathroom" is a hole in the floor with a roll of toilet paper next to it.
Molly says: "Thanks!"
Molly says: "I went for understated chique."
Penny says: "Molly has such a good eye for interior design."
All except Masami nod and cheer.
Masami says: "Boring!"
Masami says: "You think because it's in a tree it's all that?"
Masami says: "Well, it isn't: it's just as boring as a real house."
Masami says: "I mean, what is it you actually do in here, Molly?"
Molly says: "Well, uh, I just hang out, watch the boys..."
The girls look through the window; Darwin, Tobias, and Banana Joe are cheering on Gumball to jump over a van with a skateboard, at which he slams into, setting the alarm off.
Masami says: "Laaame!"
Masami says: "You don't watch boys, you kiss them."
Everyone but Masami says: "What?!"
Everyone but Masami says: "!"
Masami says: "Hold on!"
Masami says: "Don't tell me you don't have boyfriends."
Masami says: "You do, Molly, right?"
Molly says: "Uh, sure I do!"
Molly says: "You don't know him, though."
Molly says: "He's way older and..."
Molly says: "he's in high school!"
Everyone but Molly says: "Wow!"
Masami says: "Wow!"
Teri says: "Well, my boyfriend is so old that he doesn't have a babysitter!"
Everyone but Teri says: "Wow!"
Masami says: "Wow!"
Carmen says: "Well, mine's so old, he stopped wearing braces!"
Everyone but Carmen says: "Wow!"
Masami says: "Wow!"
Carrie says: "Well, mine is so old that he doesn't even have teeth."
Everyone looks awkwardly at Carrie.
Penny walks near the window.
Camera changes to the boys. Gumball gets up and cracks his arms, back and neck.
Gumball says: "Did Penny see my stunt?"
Banana Joe says: "Don't tell me you wanna impress those..."
Banana Joe says: "those..."
Banana Joe says: "those..."
Banana Joe says: "perfumed sissies!"
Gumball says: "You mean those girls over there?"
Gumball says: "Tch, nah..."
Gumball says: "They wouldn't care about a handsome bachelor, twelve years old, who likes foreign cinema, fine dining, extreme sports and long romantic walks on the beach by moonlight."
Banana Joe says: "Let's make a pact, right here, right now."
Banana Joe says: "Pals before gals!"
Darwin says: "Pals before gals!"
Tobias​​​​ says: "Pals before gals!"
Gumball says: "Eeehh..."
Gumball says: "Okay..."
Gumball puts his hand with the other boys, then looks to the window. Penny waves, and he does the same.
Tobias​​​​ says: "Wait, wait, wait!"
Tobias​​​​ says: "Let's make a blood pact!"
Camera changes to the girls.
Molly says: "So, your turn to tell us, Masami."
Molly says: "Do you have a boyfriend?"
Masami says: "Darwin!"
Everyone but Masami says: "Darwin?!"
Everyone but Masami says: "!"
Masami says: "Yeah, he's great because..."
Masami says: "he's got legs and, you know..."
Masami says: "a head."
Carrie says: "Okay."
The Hallway.
Gumball, Darwin, Banana Joe and Tobias are together; Tobias is still trying to make a wound in his hand.
Gumball says: "Dude, stop it already."
Tobias stops trying to wound himself. As he does, a group of giggling can be heard.
Banana Joe says: "Guys, guys, guys!"
Banana Joe says: "Enemy at twelve o'clock."
Gumball, Darwin and Tobias look at their watches.
Banana Joe says: "No, this way!"
The camera moves to the girls.
Masami says: "There he is."
Banana Joe says: "Remember, pals before gals."
They nod.
Masami says: "Hello, sweet cheeks."
The boys says: "WHAT?!"
The boys says: "!"
The boys says: "?"
Carrie says: "Oh, c'mon."
Carrie says: "He is not your boyfriend, Masami."
Masami says: "Ha!"
Masami says: "He so is."
Masami says: "Look."
Masami says: "Hold my book, boyfriend."
Darwin says: "Uhhh..."
Darwin says: "Okay?"
Masami says: "I'll show you how he likes me at the treehouse."
The girls leave while laughing.
Banana Joe says: "I can't believe it."
Banana Joe says: "You, you, you..."
Banana Joe says: "girl-lover!"
Gumball says: "It's always the quiet ones."
Darwin says: "She's not my girlfriend!"
Darwin says: "What am I gonna do?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Darwin says: "WHAT AM I GONNA DO?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Darwin says: "I know, I'll just run away and hide forever!"
Darwin jumps out of the window; he walks away with a limp.
Darwin says: "I'll never forget you, guys!"
Gumball says: "That was dramatic."
Penny says: "Hey, Gumball."
Gumball's face lightens up and he waves at Penny.
Gumball says: "Hey, Penny."
Penny says: "Wanna walk me to the canteen?"
Gumball says: "definitely not, definitely not now, but maybe..."
Gumball says: "later?"
Penny looks confused at Gumball, as Banana Joe and Tobias disapprove of him. Gumball then sighs and jumps out of the window like Darwin did; walking away with a limp.
Penny says: "Okaaaay?"
Penny says: "See you later."
The Cafeteria.
Gumball is in line to get his food, cracks his arm.
Darwin says: "Gumball!"
Gumball looks under the table.
Gumball says: "Darwin?"
Gumball says: "I thought you ran away forever."
Darwin says: "I got hungry."
The girls are at a table laughing.
Darwin says: "Oh, no!"
Darwin says: "They're here."
Gumball and Darwin peer through a column.
Darwin says: "What am I gonna do now?"
Gumball says: "Don't worry buddy."
Gumball says: "If you can't see them, they can't see you."
They splash their trails on their face and start walking. They crash with a number of columns before they stop at the girls' table.
Gumball says: "Ok, I think we're safe."
They remove the trails from their face and realize where they are.
Gumball says: "Hey."
Darwin says: "Hey."
Masami says: "Yeah, hi."
Masami says: "I was just talking about you, boyfriend."
Masami says: "Come and sit by me."
Darwin whimpers.
Masami says: "Oh, c'mon!"
Masami says: "Don't be shy, sugar lumps, and give me a hug."
Gumball says: "Excuse me."
Gumball says: "Is..."
Gumball says: "there room..."
Gumball says: "for one more."
Gumball says: "So, what are we talking about?"
Masami says: "Ha!"
Masami says: "Well, before you so rudely interrupted us, we were talking about how Darwin is gonna kiss me in the tree house."
Darwin says: "What?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Masami says: "Yeah."
Masami says: "Because that's what boyfriend and girlfriend do."
Masami says: "Come on, boyfriend, let's go somewhere more private."
Darwin's still shocked.
Masami says: "Boyfriend!"
Darwin starts leaving, but then stops and turns to Gumball.
Gumball says: "Don't worry, buddy."
Gumball says: "I'm here for you."
Gumball says: "Pals before..."
Penny passes by and winks at Gumball.
Gumball says: "Hi, Penny."
Penny says: "Hey, Gumball."
Gumball says: "Where was I?"
Gumball says: "Oh yeah, Darwin!"
The Swimming Pool.
Masami says: "Darwin!"
Masami says: "Darwin, where are you?"
Masami says: "Darwin?"
Masami says: "Darwin!"
Gumball passes by and notices some bubbles coming out the pool.
Gumball says: "Huh?"
Gumball says: "What are you doing here?"
Darwin mumbles underwater, making what he says inaudible. Then, a pair of bubbles he made pop, revealing what he said.
Darwin says: "She won't find me down here."
Darwin says: "She hates getting her hair wet."
Gumball says: "Really?"
Masami says: "Hey, have you seen Darwin around?"
Gumball says: "Don't worry buddy, I'm on it."
On the high dive, Gumball gets dizziness from the height.
Gumball says: "Oh, oh man."
Penny says: "Hey Masami, have you seen Gumball anywhere?"
Gumball says: "Oh no, I can't do that to Penny."
Penny says: "What was that?"
Masami says: "I don't know, but it sounded painful."
Penny says: "Oh, well!"
Penny says: "See you at the treehouse."
Masami says: "Darwin!"
Darwin comes up inhaling, with water coming out of his mouth and nostrils.
Masami says: "There you are!"
Masami says: "C'mon, we're going for ice cream."
Gumball remerges, reddened.
Gumball says: "Aaaaahhh..."
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Oww..."
Gumball hops around moaning in pain before he grabs a pair of ice cream cones Idaho was carrying and puts them on his chest.
Idaho says: "Hey!"
Idaho leaves angrily. Rocky passes by and notices the ice creams on Gumball's chest.
Rocky says: "Hey, dude!"
Rocky says: "Nice bikini!"
Gumball says: "Thanks."
Gumball says: "Oh, Rocky, wait!"
Gumball says: "You've had girlfriends before, right?"
Rocky says: "Oh, yeah!"
Rocky says: "Thousands of 'em!"
Gumball says: "And how did you get rid of them?"
Rocky says: "Well, usually, I just close my eyes and open my heart, and when I open my eyes again, they're gone..."
Gumball says: "What do you mean?"
Rocky says: "Well, I guess they don't want me to talk about my feelings..."
Gumball says: "So, you mean, openly expressing your emotional turmoil, rather than coming up with a convoluted little scheme."
Gumball says: "It's so crazy it just might work."
The Hallway Again.
Gumball is in a wastebasket and gives a thumbs up to Darwin who is nervous.
Masami says: "Darwin!"
Darwin says: "Listen, Masami."
Darwin says: "This is very difficult for me to say."
Darwin says: "I'm leaving."
Darwin says: "We've had good times together, but it's just not right for me."
Darwin says: "I can't help how I feel."
Darwin says: "It's not your fault, it's mine."
Darwin says: "I'm just not ready for something this amazing."
Darwin says: "You deserve someone better."
Darwin says: "Now farewell, dear heart."
Masami glares at Darwin, and he waves at her, giving her a go on motion. Then Masami looks she's about to get angry, but starts crying.
Darwin says: "What should I do?"
Gumball says: "I don't know."
Leslie​​ says: "Nice work, Romeo."
Darwin says: "Okay, okay."
Darwin says: "I didn't mean it."
Darwin says: "Boyfriend joke."
Darwin says: "Look, I'm laughing."
Darwin says: "You can stop crying now, please."
Masami shoots a lightning bolt.
Darwin says: "Please, I'll do anything you want."
Darwin says: "I'll go to the treehouse."
Darwin says: "I'll..."
Darwin says: "I'll-I'll kiss you."
Masami immediately stops.
Masami says: "Okay, see ya there, sweet lips."
Gumball says: "Oh, man."
Gumball says: "I am so sorry."
Gumball says: "I'm sorry, dude."
Gumball says: "Don't be like that..."
Gumball says: "Don't worry, buddy, I'll save you!"
Darwin says: "How?!"
Darwin says: "!"
Darwin says: "You need to have a date to get in that treehouse!"
Gumball says: "Yeah, that is true."
Banana Joe says: "And what happened to "pals before gals"?"
Gumball says: "That's cool, I'll find a way to save him."
Banana Joe says: "You better, cause if you don't, we will."
Banana Joe and Tobias leave.
Penny says: "Hi, Gumball."
Gumball follows Penny happily while giggling.
The Treehouse.
Darwin and Masami arrive at the ladder of the treehouse.
Masami says: "After you, boyfriend."
Masami winks and Darwin gets scared.
Darwin says: "Somebody, please, help me."
Masami says: "What did you say?"
Darwin says: "Nothing!"
Darwin says: "I'm climbing, climbing."
Darwin climbs up the treehouse and sees Gumball inside with the others.
Gumball says: "Hey, Darwin!"
Darwin says: "Oh, no!"
Darwin says: "They got you, too!"
Gumball says: "Oh yeah, they got me."
Gumball says: "It was horrible, ohh."
Gumball says: "Oh, no, don't drag me in there and kiss me."
Gumball says: "Hehehe."
Gumball says: "Oh, well, now that we're here..."
Masami says: "So, girls, where are all of your boyfriends?"
Awkward silence, along with whistling.
Teri says: "My boyfriend's not real."
Everyone gasps, then the rest of the girls, and Leslie, confess as well.
Masami says: "So, me and Penny are the only ones with boys to kiss."
Masami says: "Darwin?"
Darwin tries to sneak out of the treehouse.
Masami says: "Come on, boyfriend!"
Everyone except Gumball and Penny starts chanting "Kiss" as Masami tries to kiss Darwin, while he is backing away from her.
Darwin says: "Gumball, do something!"
Gumball says: "Just a minute."
Gumball says: "Hehe, sorry, I have to save my best friend."
Penny grabs Gumball's hand, making him dazed.
Penny says: "I'm really glad you came."
Darwin says: "Please, you don't wanna kiss me!"
Darwin says: "I taste like fish!"
Darwin gets away and Masami ends up kissing the wall.
Masami says: "Get back here!"
Darwin says: "Ahhhh, Gumball!"
Darwin is running from Masami in the background and they start to fade out, while Gumball and Penny are by the window.
Penny says: "It's such a beautiful day, Gumball."
Gumball says: "Yeah, but not as beautiful as your antlers."
As the camera sweeps past Penny, the background of the treehouse disappears as her and Gumball are now floating in the vast majority of space.
Gumball says: "Can you feel the universe moving around us?"
Penny says: "Uh, yeah, it's more like a swaying motion, actually."
Outside the treehouse, Banana Joe and Tobias are chopping down the tree.
Gumball says: "Let's kiss and remember this for all the eternity."
Masami says: "Let's kiss, so I can show these losers who's boss."
The tree starts falling, Gumball is sliding to Darwin, both with their lips puckered up, and Penny and Masami are shown reacting to Gumball and Darwin kissing by mistake.
Banana Joe says: "Timber!"
Tobias​​​​​​​ says: "Timber!"
The tree falls over on Banana Joe.
Gumball says: "Wow, that was amazing."
Gumball says: "Kissing Penny was like being run over by a unicorn."
Darwin says: "And kissing Masami wasn't as bad as I thought it would be."
Gumball says: "Bye, Penny."
Darwin says: "See ya later, sugar lumps."
Gumball says: "What fascinating creatures."
Banana Joe pops out of the tree bush, with his head being peeled off.
Banana Joe says: "Pals before gals!"
Episode Ends.
