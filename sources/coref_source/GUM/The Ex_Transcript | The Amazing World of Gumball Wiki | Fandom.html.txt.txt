Dinner Date.
Episode opens on a exterior shot of Elmore Mall. The camera cuts to Dinner, where Gumball and Penny are having ice cream. Gumball is eating his at a high speed.
Penny says: "Gumball, slow down."
Penny says: "You'll get brain freeze."
Gumball says: "I'll be fine."
Gumball says: "It's my special skill."
Gumball says: "I can eat as much ice cream as I want and never get—"
Scene cuts to the bathroom. Penny is holding Gumball, whose head is frozen in a block of ice, under the hand dryer.
Gumball says: "—"
Gumball says: "brain freeze."
Gumball says: "Uhh..."
Gumball says: "how'd we get here?"
They leave the bathroom.
Gumball says: "So, how about an ice cream?"
Gumball sees Rob and gasps, darting behind a payphone.
Gumball says: "It's my mortal enemy, Rob!"
Gumball says: "Do you think he saw me?"
Gumball says: "Have I ever told you about Rob?"
Penny says: "Yeah, once or twice."
Flashback to Penny's birthday. As Patrick, Judith, and Polly try to sing happy birthday, Gumball is talking over them.
Gumball says: "And then Rob tried to blow up the dam, and then he said "I am your nemesis!"
Gumball says: "" but in a cool British accent that I actually gave him."
Flashback to Gumball and Penny on the Stomach Destroyer roller coaster.
Gumball says: "This reminds me of that time the bus went through the tunnel as Rob tried to blow it up, but obviously I thwarted him by wrestling on the wing of a plane."
As Gumball goes on, Penny gets off the ride, bored; Cuts back to the present day.
Gumball says: "And then I saw Rob in the mall and explained to Penny about how like, Rob's my nemesis."
Penny says: "Yeah, Gumball, that's right now."
Gumball says: "Oh."
Gumball peers out from behind the payphone and spots Rob by Larry's Hardware Store.
Gumball says: "What's he buying?"
Gumball says: "Oh, don't tell me."
Gumball says: "No, tell me!"
Gumball says: "No, don't tell me!"
Gumball says: "Just give me a clue."
Gumball says: "Okay, two clues!"
Penny says: "Mmm..."
Penny says: "he seems to be buying a circular saw."
Gumball says: "Is the blade diamond edged?"
Penny says: "No, just a regular blade."
Gumball says: "That's okay, we're not there yet."
Penny says: "Wait!"
Penny says: "He's leaving."
Penny says: "I think he's getting a coffee."
Gumball says: "Looks like someone wants to stay up all night creating plans to destroy me."
Penny says: "It's decaf."
Gumball says: "Oh..."
Gumball says: "Looks like someone wants to sleep well so he can wake up early and create plans to destroy me."
Penny says: "What is it with you two?"
Gumball says: "We're nemesises."
Gumball says: "Nemesisses?"
Gumball says: "Nemesize?"
Penny says: "Nemeses."
Gumball says: "You wouldn't understand."
Gumball's phone buzzes, and he checks it.
Phone says: "You have one unread threatening message."
Gumball says: "It's from Rob!"
Gumball says: "I'm too excited, you read it!"
Penny says: ""I hate you more than anything in the world."
Penny says: ""I'm gonna smoosh you out of your yellow skin."
Gumball says: "Okay, he's color-blind."
Gumball says: "He never mentioned that before, but secrets are fine!"
Penny says: ""I hate your slimy bananary guts."
Gumball says: "It's a bit weird to call my guts bananary, but let's just go with it."
Penny says: ""You are my nemesis, Banana Joe?"
Gumball says: "It's a weird new nickname for me, but it's still good to know he's thinking about me."
Penny says: "I don't think that message was for you."
Gumball says: "It's obviously just some sort of mistake."
Gumball says: "I'll just ask Rob."
Gumball moves with an unusual gait, and Penny follows him.
Penny says: "Are you okay?"
Penny says: "You're walking kinda strange."
Gumball says: "No, this is my normal, casual walk and my normal, casual whistle."
He begins whistling, then increases his speed to catch up to Rob.
Gumball says: "Oh, hey Rob."
Gumball says: "You didn't see me there."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "What?"
Gumball says: "You'll laugh at this."
Gumball says: "I got a threatening message from you, and uh, Penny here says it isn't for me."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Oh, you got that message."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "This is awkward..."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "um, that-that wasn't for you."
Penny says: "Told you."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Yeah, I-I should've let you know."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "The thing is, I'm neme-seeing someone else now."
Gumball says: "What?"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Yeah, that message was for Banana Joe."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "He's kinda my new nemesis."
Gumball says: "You're not making any sense!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Look, I try to end you, you try to end me."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "You save me, I save you."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "It got complicated."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "I need something more simple right now."
Gumball says: "Oh, and Banana Joe is simple?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Okay, so I'll give you that."
Gumball says: "But I thought we had something!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "I guess you and I just kind of..."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "drifted together."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Banana Joe's just easier to hate."
Gumball bites his lip and whimpers.
Rob​​​​​​ says: "You gonna be okay?"
Gumball continues to whimper; The background lighting dims.
Penny says: "Gumball?"
Penny says: "Gumball!"
Gumball says: "I'm fine."
The mall is now dark and empty. Penny sighs, picks up Gumball, and carries him off.
Exes and Foes.
Back at the Wattersons' house, Gumball is in his bedroom with Penny.
Gumball says: "He doesn't want to be my nemesis anymore!"
Penny says: "Well, I'm sure he still hates you."
Penny says: "He's just not..."
Penny says: "in hate with you."
Gumball says: "I just don't want to go back out there on the hating scene."
Penny says: "Don't worry, I'm sure there's someone out there that wants to destroy you."
Penny says: "Irate neighbors, outraged friends, humiliated teachers, the list is endless."
Gumball says: "And with Darwin away too, I just..."
Gumball says: "feel so neglected."
Darwin says: "I'm not away."
Darwin says: "I've been here the whole ti—"
Gumball says: "You've got no idea what it's like to feel under-appreciated!"
Penny says: "I think I do."
Doorbell rings.
Gumball says: "Maybe it's Rob!"
Penny says: "Gumball!"
Gumball says: "But it could be him!"
Penny says: "No."
Gumball says: "But—"
Penny says: "No."
Gumball says: "But—"
Penny says: "No!"
Darwin suddenly swaps places with Gumball, and is wearing his clothes. He smiles awkwardly at Penny.
Darwin says: "How did he do that?"
On the front porch, Rob is holding a large box. Gumball peeks through the window, then heads outside while pretending to be on the phone.
Gumball says: "Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah, sure."
Gumball says: "Uh, so I'll see you at three tomorrow for you nemesis interview, um..."
Gumball says: "Pied Piper?"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Really, the Pied Piper?"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "That's the best nemesis you could come up with?"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "I don't even want to get into the fact that you're only wearing underpants and speaking into a TV remote."
Gumball says: "Oh."
Gumball presses random buttons in his attempt to turn off the television, and drops the remote.
Gumball says: "What can I do for you?"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Seeing as I'm now someone else's nemesis, I don't really need this stuff anymore."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "It's some photos of you taken on long-distance lens, batteries from your smoke alarm."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "You know, that kinda thing."
Gumball says: "Oh, thank you."
Gumball says: "I'll just check it's all here."
Gumball says: "Yep, that all seems to be in order."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Right."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Anyway, I better be going."
As Rob leaves, he hears music coming from a boombox that Gumball is lifting above his head.
Boombox says: "Standing right here."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Huh?"
Boombox says: "Right in front of you, babe."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Uhh, what are you doing?"
Gumball says: "You used to hate this song."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Hm."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Not anymore."
Boombox says: "Ohhhh, to you babe."
The music continues as the screen fades to black. Next, Rob is shown observing Banana Joe through binoculars.
Rob​​​​​​ says: "That's right, straight into my trap."
Rob peers at the rectangular shadow in Banana Joe's path, then up at a platform of bricks suspended by a rope. He lowers the binoculars and prepares to cut the rope.
Gumball says: "Hey, Rob."
Gumball is seated on a bicycle nearby.
Gumball says: "Whatcha doin'?"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Uh, I'm kind of in the middle of something."
Gumball says: "I see you got some scissors there."
Gumball says: "Well, I was gonna ride my bike through some heavy traffic."
Gumball says: "It would be terrible if someone were to cut my brakes."
Rob glances at Banana Joe, who is almost in range of the trap.
Gumball says: "Yep."
Gumball says: "That would be super dangerous if somebody did that."
Gumball says: "I'd be obliterated."
Gumball says: "I mean, there'd be nothing left of me."
Banana Joe steps directly under the platform, but Rob no longer has the scissors.
Gumball says: "They'd have to use my dental records to figure out who I was."
Gumball says: "Yeah, it would be terrible if someone, you know, cut my brakes."
Gumball says: "Rob?"
Gumball says: "Rob?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Gumball says: "Rob?"
Leonard Daniels says: "Excuse me?"
Leonard Daniels says: "I don't mind cutting your brakes."
Gumball says: "What?"
Gumball says: "Weirdo!"
Gumball pedals away on his bike.
Cease and Desist.
Banana Joe is sitting at a table in the Elmore Mall food court. Larry approaches and places a hamburger in front of him.
Larry says: "And here's your burger, sir."
Banana Joe says: "But I didn't order one."
Larry says: "It's from a secret admirer."
Banana Joe says: "Oh!"
Banana Joe says: "How nice!"
He starts to eat the burger, while Rob watches from elsewhere.
Rob​​​​​​ says: "That's it."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Just one bite, and it's bye-bye—"
Banana Joe says: "Oh!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Huh?"
Banana Joe says: "Mustn't forget to take out the pickle."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Just one bite, and it's bye-bye—"
Banana Joe says: "Oh!"
Banana Joe says: "Mustn't forget to take out the onions."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Just one bite—"
Banana Joe says: "Oh!"
Banana Joe says: "Mustn't forget to take out the sesame seeds."
Banana Joe says: "One, two, three..."
Gumball says: "What's he got that I haven't?"
Gumball appears beside Rob, wearing a banana costume.
Gumball says: "Is it his voice?"
Gumball says: "Is that it?"
Gumball says: "'Cause I can change."
Gumball says: "I can do his voice, easy."
Gumball says: "Hello Rob, I'm Banana Joe."
Gumball says: "I'm the poor man's Gumball."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Hmph!"
Gumball says: "Look, I can be annoying."
Gumball grabs a cup next to him, and proceeds to slurp through the straw.  He increases the volume of his slurping in an effort to invoke a reaction from Rob, but ends up inhaling the straw by mistake.
Gumball says: "Ha!"
Gumball says: "That's gotta be annoying, right?"
Gumball says: "Hit with a spitty straw right in the face!"
Gumball says: "That's gotta be ex-straw-dinarily annoying."
Banana Joe says: "Twenty-one..."
Rob continues to ignore Gumball.
Gumball says: "Oh come on!"
Gumball says: "That joke was terrible!"
Gumball says: "Fine, you want me to go full Banana Joe?"
Gumball says: "'Cause I'll do it!"
Gumball says: "Ba-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, ba-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na."
Banana Joe says: "Twenty-se—"
Banana Joe says: "Huh?"
Gumball says: "Ba-na-na-na—"
Banana Joe says: "Gumball Watterson, you've been served."
Banana Joe gives him an envelope and marches off-screen. Gumball opens the envelope and reads the letter as Rob comes out of hiding.
Gumball says: "Apparently making terrible jokes, jumping around, and replacing song lyrics with the word "banana" is a breach of intellectual property rights."
Gumball says: "Ay caramba!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Argh!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "I can't believe it!"
Gumball says: "You're annoyed at me?!"
Gumball says: "!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "No, Banana Joe!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "He makes me so angry!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "All that planning, and he didn't touch the burger!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Or even let me finish my supervillain quip!"
Rob angrily chases after Banana Joe.
Gumball says: "It was gonna be, "Bye-bye, banana," right?"
Gumball says: "I'll eat the burger!"
Gumball says: "Look!"
Gumball says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "It didn't do any—"
He is immediately engulfed in an explosion.
Be Friends.
Gumball is in his bedroom again, along with Darwin and Penny.
Gumball says: "What am I gonna do?"
Gumball says: "All the cool guys have nemesesies."
Penny says: "Like who?"
Gumball says: "That boy wizard who had that creepy ginger dude following him around."
Penny says: "That wasn't his nemesis."
Gumball says: "Really?"
Gumball says: "He never helped."
Darwin says: "I've got my nemesis."
Penny says: "Who?"
Gumball says: "Don't get him started."
Darwin glares at a blue baseball cap that is lying atop the wardrobe.
Gumball says: "Dude, it's a hat."
Darwin says: "That's just what he wants you to think."
Penny says: "Maybe you should just accept it and turn over a new leaf."
Penny says: "I mean, it's not like..."
Gumball says: "Maybe I should just accept it and turn over a new leaf."
Penny says: "You guys should just be friends."
Gumball says: "Don't worry, I came up with a much better idea while you were blabbering on."
Gumball says: "Me and Rob are gonna be friends."
Penny says: "That is literally what I just said."
Gumball says: "Aww, we make such a great team."
Outside the Bananas' house at night, Rob is using night-vision goggles to spy on Banana Joe through a window.
Banana Barbara says: "Joe sweetie, when you're finished dancing to no music, don't forget to take out the trash."
Banana Joe says: "Okay, Mom!"
Gumball pops up directly in front of Rob.
Gumball says: "Hey buddy!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "What?!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "!"
Gumball says: "Oh nothing."
Gumball says: "Just wanted to hang out."
Gumball says: "You know, like friends?"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "What?"
Gumball says: "Yeah, I'm just here to help."
Rob sighs, then resumes using the goggles.
Gumball says: "I booby-trapped his house."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "What?"
Gumball says: "I booby-trapped his house."
Gumball says: "To help a buddy out."
Gumball says: "You know, buddies?"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Oh."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "When's it gonna go off?"
Gumball says: "Any minute now."
Rob looks on in anticipation for several seconds.
Gumball says: "So..."
Gumball says: "why are we watching this house?"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Because it's where Banana Joe lives?"
Gumball says: "Oh, then whose house did I—"
There is an explosion off-screen, and an injured and burning Tobias flies overhead.
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "WHY?!"
Tobias​​​​​​ says: "!"
Gumball says: "Oh."
Gumball says: "Tobias."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Never mind."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "I've rigged Banana Joe's front door handle so that when he opens it to take out the trash, it unhooks a latch on the back of the truck down the street, releasing the oil drums, which will roll down the sidewalk towards him."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "So just as he lifts the lid, he is obliterated."
Gumball says: "Wow."
Gumball says: "You really explained that in a lot of unnecessary detail."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Shh."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Here he comes."
The door opens, setting off the trap exactly as Rob described. Banana Joe whistles as he walks to the garbage can, and the barrels get closer. A sudden flash of light stops him in his tracks, causing him to narrowly avoid the out of control barrels.
Banana Joe says: "Huh?"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Agh, what are you doing?!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "Turn it off!"
Gumball has his phone's flashlight activated.
Gumball says: "I was gonna take a photo but I switched the torch on by mistake!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "What is wrong with you?!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "!"
Banana Joe says: "Did you see that?"
Gumball says: "Uh, yeah."
My Hate Will Go On.
Banana Joe says: "So..."
Banana Joe says: "What are you doing?"
Gumball says: "Just chilin' with my buddy, Rob."
Gumball says: "In a bush."
Gumball says: "Right, Rob?"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "What is wrong with you?!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "You just ruined the whole thing for me again!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "I don't believe it!"
Rob​​​​​​ says: "You've got to be the most insufferable, annoying, selfish person I've ever met!"
Gumball says: "Go on."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "In fact, I think I really, really, REALLY..."
Gumball says: "Say it."
Rob​​​​​​ says: "HAAAAAAAAAAATTE YOOOOOOOOU!"
Rob snaps, grabs Gumball, and violently shakes him while he smiles in contentment.  Music plays in the background.
Lyrics says: "And you, will love me forever."
The camera tilts upward to the night sky, and a shooting star streaks by. The next day, Gumball is at school putting a book into his locker.
Gumball says: "You see, Darwin?"
Gumball says: "It's all about keeping the hatred interesting."
Gumball says: "I mean, it's no big deal, but he did say he'd hate me forever."
Gumball closes the locker, then heads down the hall with Darwin, who is sporting a blue baseball cap.
Darwin says: "Wow!"
Darwin says: "That's a big commitment."
Gumball says: "I've smoothed things over with Penny as well."
Gumball says: "I couldn't find any cards that said, "Sorry I spent all this time ignoring you because I was trying to get some dude to hate me."
Darwin says: "So what did you do?"
Up ahead, Penny opens her locker and is shocked to discover Alan inside. The words, "I'm Sorry Penny" are written on him and her school supplies.
Alan​​​​​​ says: "Thank goodness!"
Alan​​​​​​ says: "I couldn't breathe in there!"
Gumball says: "Yeah, I couldn't find any balloons either."
Gumball says: "So, it looks like you made up with your nemesis too."
Darwin says: "What do you mean?"
Gumball says: "The hat?"
The episode ends.
