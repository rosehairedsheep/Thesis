The episode opens with Stan Pines driving the Mystery Cart and stopping at the bottomless pit.
Stan Pines says: "In this land of ours, there are many great pits."
Stan Pines says: "But none more bottomless than the bottomless pit."
Stan Pines says: "Which as you can see here is bottomless."
Soos Ramirez says: "Question."
Soos Ramirez says: "Is it bottomless?"
Stan says: "Kids, can one of you try explaining this to Soos?"
Dipper Pines says: "Grunkle Stan, why are we here again?"
Stan says: "To dispose of things that we don't want."
Stan says: "So long, Mystery Shack suggestion cards!"
Mabel Pines says: "Goodbye, creepy love letters from Li'l Gideon!"
Mabel Pines says: "Die!"
Mabel Pines says: "Die!"
Dipper says: "What are you doing?"
Soos says: "Throwing stuff, dude."
Soos says: "Everyone's doin' it."
Stan says: "What you got there, Mabel?"
Mabel says: "Oh, it's just my personal box of mysterious secrets."
Mabel says: "Nothing worth wondering about."
Mabel says: "Goodbye forever!"
Dipper says: "Grunkle Stan, do I really have to be the one to point out that a bottomless pit is, by definition, impossible?"
Stan says: "Says you."
Mabel says: "Well, I guess we'll never know."
Wind starts blowing.
Soos says: "Aah!"
Soos says: "It's some sort of invisible pushing force!"
Dipper says: "Quick!"
Dipper says: "Everyone back to the shack!"
Stan says: "I'm not done getting rid of these yet!"
Mabel says: "Grunkle Stan!"
Mabel says: "No!"
Stan says: "Almost..."
Stan says: "Almost..."
Stan says: "Almost!"
Soos says: "So, anyone want to scream some more?"
Dipper says: "Where are we?"
Dipper says: "We're gonna land on something eventually."
Dipper says: "It could be any second now."
Everyone braces for a landing but nothing happens.
Stan says: "Well..."
Stan says: "it looks like we're down here for the long haul."
Stan says: "Who wants to see some card tricks?"
Stan says: "Tada!"
Soos says: "Hey, maybe we should pass the time by telling stories."
Dipper says: "I've got a story."
Dipper says: "It's called the time Grunkle Stan got us all thrown into a bottomless pit where we spent the rest of our NATURAL LIVES!"
Soos says: "Go on..."
Mabel says: "Come on, Dipper, you can do better than that."
Dipper says: "Fine."
Mabel says: "Ready?"
Mabel says: "Spin the Pig!"
Wendy Corduroy says: "Spin the Pig!"
Soos says: "Spin the Pig!"
Mabel says: "Hey!"
Mabel says: "Grunkle Stan."
Mabel says: "Ever kissed a pig before?"
Stan says: "I'm not gonna answer that question."
Dipper says: "Guys!"
Dipper says: "I think I just got bit by a snake!"
Dipper says: "I need you to get me to a hospital quick!"
Dipper says: "What?"
Dipper says: "What's so funny?"
Stan says: "Sorry."
Stan says: "It's just hard to focus on what you're saying with that squeaky puberty voice you got there."
Dipper says: "My what?"
Mabel says: "It's nothing to be ashamed of, Dipper."
Mabel says: "Your voice is  hillaaarrious!"
Dipper says: "Are you saying my voice cracks?"
Dipper says: "My voice doesn't crack!"
Soos says: "Dude, no offense, but it cracks so much we've already made a techno remix out of it."
Remix says: "Nice to meet you: My name's Dipper Pines, P-P-Pines, Pines, Pines: Nice to meet you: P-p-pines, Pines, Pines: Dipper: Do I really sound like that?"
Wendy says: "Oh, here comes my favorite part!"
Remix says: "Stop it, guys!"
Dipper says: "Give me that!"
Mabel says: "Spin the Pig!"
Soos says: "Spin the Pig!"
Wendy says: "Spin the Pig!"
Dipper says: "Even my sigh sounds weird."
Old Man McGucket says: "Hello there!"
McGucket says: "I couldn't help but overhear your situation."
McGucket says: "Old Man McGucket,  part-time inventor."
Dipper says: "Why do you spit on your hand?"
McGucket says: "I don't rightly know."
Dipper says: "Hey, I remember you!"
Dipper says: "Your robot almost killed me!"
McGucket says: "Horrrrifyin' voice!"
McGucket says: "You can run, but I'll still be in your nightmares!"
Dipper says: "This will really fix my voice?"
Dipper says: "Thanks!"
McGucket says: "Come mornin', you'll sound like a new man..."
McGucket says: "If you survive."
Dipper says: "Morning Mabel."
Dipper says: "Who's my favorite Mabel?"
Mabel says: "Who are you?!"
Mabel says: "!"
Mabel says: "What have you done with my brother!"
Mabel says: "?"
Mabel says: "Dipper!"
Mabel says: "I'll save you from this body switching warlock!"
Dipper says: "Mabel, it's me."
Dipper says: "This is my voice now."
Dipper says: "I sound awesome."
Dipper says: "Soouund aaawesome."
Mabel says: "I know boys' voices change, but this is weird."
Mabel says: "Weird and bad."
Dipper says: "But Mabel, this is the best thing that has ever happened to me."
Dipper says: "And just think of the prank calls."
Tats says: "Hello?"
Dipper says: "Hello, this is the President of the United States of America."
Dipper says: "I am calling to tell you..."
Tats says: "What?"
Tats says: "Who is this?!"
Tats says: "!"
Dipper says: "Magnificent!"
Mabel says: "Mabel no like."
Dipper says: "How are you diddly-doing, Soos?"
Soos says: "Kill it!"
Soos says: "Kill it with fire!"
Soos says: "Everyone flee!"
Dipper says: "What gives, man?"
Dipper says: "You guys all made fun of my old voice."
Dipper says: "I thought you'd like the new one."
Soos says: "Well, at least before you sounded like a real person."
Soos says: "Now, you sound like some weird commercial dude."
Dipper says: "I'll find Stan."
Dipper says: "He'll like my new voice."
Dipper says: "You'll see."
Dipper says: "I'll be right back after these messages!"
Dipper says: ".."
Dipper says: "I mean..."
Dipper says: "goodbye."
Tats says: "Huh?"
Tats says: "I know that voice anywhere!"
Tats says: "You're that guy that prank-called me earlier!"
Dipper says: "No I'm not."
Dipper says: "I'm a 12 year old boy."
Tats says: "You expect me to believe that?"
Tats says: "You crazy-voiced punk!"
Dipper says: "Wait!"
Dipper says: "No!"
Tats says: "There's a prank caller on the loose!"
Tats says: "Let's get him!"
Dipper says: "McGucket!"
Dipper says: "Your invention was a catastrophe!"
McGucket says: "That's probably why I live in a dump!"
Dipper says: "My own sister didn't recognize me."
Dipper says: "I scared away crowds."
Dipper says: "I even sound ridiculous when I cry."
McGucket says: "Well, now."
McGucket says: "Here's your problem."
McGucket says: "I gave you the wrong drinking majiggy."
McGucket says: "This one's for voice over professionals."
McGucket says: "I'm sure I got a better voice in here somewhere."
Dipper says: "Good!"
Dipper says: "Hurry up!"
McGucket says: "You got here just in time."
McGucket says: "Come sundown, you'd be back to your ridiculous old voice."
Dipper says: "It was ridiculous, wasn't it?"
McGucket says: "Are you ready for your new voice?"
McGucket says: "This one should be permanent!"
Dipper says: "Hey guys."
Mabel says: "Dipper!"
Soos says: "Dude, you're back!"
Dipper says: "I guess I realized that even though my voice may not be perfect, it's still mine, and I wouldn't change it for anything, not even for whatever was in this new vial."
Mabel says: "So, what did you do with the rest of that potion?"
Dipper says: "I dumped it in Stan's coffee."
Stan says: "Have any of you kids seen mah girdle?"
Stan says: "Where mah girdle at?"
Stan says: "What?"
Stan says: "What's so funny?"
Stan says: "I'm Grunkle Stay-an!"
Stan says: "Kids laughing."
Stan says: "Laughing at they Grunkle."
Cuts back to real time says: "Mabel: I spy with my little eye something that is..."
Cuts back to real time says: "Black!"
Soos says: "Ooh ooh!"
Soos says: "Everything!"
Mabel says: "Yay for Soos!"
Soos says: "Yay for Soos!"
Mabel says: "Hey guys, who wants to pass the time by spinning?"
Mabel says: "Everyone spin!"
Dipper says: "No."
Mabel says: "Yaay!"
Dipper says: "Woooaah!"
Mabel says: "Weeee!"
Dipper says: "Ow, ow, ow, ow."
Stan says: "Dipper's pain is funny, but I'm starting to get bored."
Stan says: "Soos, tell a story."
Soos says: "Really?"
Soos says: "Okay."
Dipper says: "Go!"
Mabel says: "Go!"
Dipper says: "Go!"
Mabel says: "Go!"

Mabel says: "Go!"
Dipper says: "Go!"
Mabel says: "Go!"
Dipper says: "Go!"
Mabel says: "Go!"
Dipper says: "Go!"
Mabel says: "Go!"
Soos says: "This is it, dudes."
Soos says: "After 4 long years of trying, I might finally get a high score on Stan's creepy old pinball machine."
Soos says: "If I do this, I'll go down in pinball history, with the likes of Sal, Gaff, and of course, Poo."
Dipper says: "Have you ever tried maybe tilting the machine?"
Soos says: "I don't know, dudes, isn't breaking the rules like, against the rules?"
Mabel says: "Nuts to the rules!"
Mabel says: "Tilt!"
Mabel says: "Tilt!"
Mabel says: "Tilt!"
Pinball Machine says: "Failure!"
Pinball Machine says: "You stink!"
Soos says: "All right, that's it!"
Soos says: "Are you ready, kids?"

Dipper says: "Tilt!"
Mabel says: "Tilt!"
Dipper says: "Tilt!"
Mabel says: "Tilt!"
Dipper says: "Tilt!"
Mabel says: "Tilt!"
Dipper says: "Tilt!"
Pinball Machine says: "Quit tiltin', partner."
Pinball Machine says: "Quit tiltin'!"
Soos says: "Tilt!"
Pinball Machine says: "Bulls-eye!"
Pinball Machine says: "New high score!"
Soos says: "This is the best moment of my life."
Soos says: "This totally beats my old best moment."
Pinball Machine says: "That ain't right."
Pinball Machine says: "You cheated."
Mabel says: "Oh, yeah."
Mabel says: "What are you gonna do about it?"
Mabel says: "You're just a Pinball game, Pinball game."
Mabel says: "Taunt, taunt."
Dipper says: "Uh, guys, there's an awful lot of green lightning coming out of that game."
Soos says: "No, that's the normal amount of green lightning."
Lightning strikes them. Cut to Soos wearing cowboy clothes in the pinball game.
Soos says: "Ah!"
Soos says: "That's not a normal alarm clock."
Dipper says: "Soos!"
Dipper says: "We're inside the game!"
Dipper says: "Crazy!"
Mabel says: "Sweet Moses!"
Soos says: "Hushed exclamation of wonder!"
Dipper says: "Awesome!"
Mabel says: "Boing!"
Mabel says: "Boing!"
Mabel says: "Boing!"
Mabel says: "Boing!"
Soos says: "Dude, if this is a dream, I never want to wake up!"
Pinball Machine says: "That can be arranged."
Pinball Machine says: "Welcome to Tumbleweed Terror, partners."
Soos says: "Hey, it's the skeleton cowboy guy."
Soos says: "Did you zap me into your game to congratulate me on getting my new score?"
Soos says: "I beat Poo, dude!"
Pinball Machine says: "Pardon, and if'n I do recall, I did warned y'all not to cheat."
Pinball Machine says: "I tried to be gentleman-like, but I'm plum sick of being tilted."
Pinball Machine says: "So, now I reckon, I'm gonna tilt you."
Soos says: "Well, take this!"
Mabel says: "Soos!"
Dipper says: "Soos!"
Pinball Machine says: "Get yourselves ready for the..."
Dipper says: "Multi-Ball!"
Soos says: "Multi-Ball!"
Mabel says: "Multi-Ball!"
Pinball Machine says: "Ha ha ha ha ha!"
Dipper says: "Over there!"
Dipper, Mabel, and Soos run behind a wall.
Pinball Machine says: "Where are you?"
Pinball Machine says: "I'm not done teaching you a lesson about cheating yet."
Dipper says: "How are we gonna get out of here?"
Dipper says: "Think, guys."
Soos says: "I'm trying."
Soos says: "But it's hard with that gorgeous pinball wench distracting me."
Soos says: "Okay."
Soos says: "Don't worry, guys, I know every inch of this machine."
Soos says: "There's a manual power switch inside."
Soos says: "I can sneak in there and turn off the game."
Soos says: "But we'll have to distract the cowboy guy."
Soos says: "Are any of you good at jumping up and down and making annoying noises?"
Mabel says: "My time has come."
Dipper says: "Alright, let's go, Soos."
Dipper says: "Soos?"
Soos says: "So are you, like, doing anything later?"
Soos says: "Oh, right."
Pinball Machine says: "Come on out and show yourselves, varmints."
Mabel says: "Hey!"
Mabel says: "Hey!"
Mabel says: "Hey!"
Mabel says: "Look at me and listen to what I'm doing!"
Mabel says: "BUZZZZZZ!"
Mabel says: "DISTRACTION!"
Mabel says: "DISTRACTION!"
Mabel says: "LA!"
Mabel says: "LA!"
Mabel says: "LA!"
Mabel says: "LA!"
Mabel says: "LA!"
Pinball Machine says: "Something ain't right here."
Pinball Machine says: "Let me see where this is going."
Pinball Machine says: "Ha ha ha ha."
Pinball Machine says: "Yippy ti yi what?"
Pinball Machine says: "Where are ya?"
Pinball Machine says: "Darnit, I wish I had a neck."
Dipper says: "Soos, pssssst."
Dipper says: "What's going on?"
Dipper says: "Just press the switch already!"
Soos says: "Okay, so I was gonna do that, but I've been thinking."
Soos says: "According to this, turning off the power erases the high score permanently."
Soos says: "That score is like my one big life accomplishment."
Dipper says: "What?"
Dipper says: "If you don't hurry up, we could die in here!"
Soos says: "Fair point."
Soos says: "But, what is life anyway when compared to the immortality of a high score?"
Dipper says: "Soos, are you out of your--!"
Pinball Machine says: "There y'all are."
Pinball Machine says: "Get ready to meet your maker, kids."
Pinball Machine says: "My maker is Ballway Games in Redmond, Washington."
Dipper says: "Woooooaah!"
Mabel says: "Woooooaah!"
Dipper says: "Soos!"
Mabel says: "Soos, please!"
Dipper says: "Turn it off!"
Soos says: "Uhhh Uhh."
Soos says: "Goodbye, high score."
Soos says: "Woah!"
Soos says: "You dudes okay?"
Mabel says: "Yes!"
Mabel says: "You did it!"
Mabel says: "You freed us!"
Dipper says: "Hey man, I'm sorry you had to lose your high score."
Soos says: "That's Okay."
Soos says: "I've got a new life accomplishment now."
Soos says: "Saving you dudes."
Dipper says: "Awwwww."
Mabel says: "Awwwww."
Soos says: "You think that pinball wench will call me?"
Cut back to the present.
Stan says: "I can't believe this nonsense."
Stan says: "Magic tonics?"
Stan says: "Soos winning at something?"
Stan says: "Where did you come up with this stuff?"
Stan says: "I'll tell you a good story."
Stan says: "It's called "Grunkle Stan wins the football bowl"."
Football player says: "Mr."
Football player says: "Pines, I thought that old folks were useless, but you taught me and my gloating friends a lesson."
Beautiful Woman says: "Here is your football winning trophy, Mr."
Beautiful Woman says: "Pines."
Stan says: "Thanks, beautiful woman."
Stan says: "But I couldn't have done it without my sidekick, Footbot."
Footbot says: "Thank you for building me, Daddy!"
Stan and football players laugh as fireworks go off.
Footbot says: "I love you, Stan."
Cut back to the present.
Soos says: "Boooooo!"
Dipper says: "Boooooo!"
Mabel says: "Boooooo!"
Stan says: "What?"
Stan says: "That story was great!"
Stan says: "I even threw in a talking robot for the kids."
Mabel says: "Yeah, yeah."
Mabel says: "I'm gonna tell a non-terrible story."
Mabel says: "A story called "Trooth Ache!"
Stan says: "This attraction is gonna make me a fortune."
Stan says: "Easy with that bear, Corduroy!"
Stan says: "I need him in showroom condition."
Manly Dan says: "No, Noo!"
Mabel says: "Aaaaawww."
Mabel says: "They're hugging."
Dipper says: "So, let me get this straight."
Dipper says: "Your plan is to teach a bear to ride a bicycle?"
Stan says: "No."
Stan says: "Come on, everyone's seen a bicycle-riding bear."
Stan says: "No, no."
Stan says: "I'm gonna teach this bear..."
Stan says: "to drive!"
Stan says: "Uh oh."
Stan says: "What seems to be the problem, officers?"
Sheriff Blubs says: "There better be a darn good explanation for this."
Stan says: "Oh, there is."
Stan says: "You see, I'm a very old man."
Stan says: "Not long for this Earth."
Stan says: "And the doctors assigned me a seeing eye bear to drive me to the hospital in case of an emergency."
Sheriff Blubs says: "Is that right?"
Sheriff Blubs says: "Then, where is your doctor's note?"
Stan says: "Why, it's right here, inside my jacket."
Sheriff Blubs says: "Well, I can't argue with Dr."
Sheriff Blubs says: "Medicine."
Stan says: "To the hospital, honeypants!"
Cuts to later in the Mystery Shack. Stan is painting rocks under a sign titled "Real Gold!" Mabel walks up to him.
Mabel says: "Grunkle Stan, how could you lie to those policemen?"
Mabel says: "Don't you know lying is always wrong?"
Stan says: "Mabel, when you get to be my age, you'll learn that you sometimes have to bend the truth for the greater good."
Dipper says: "Hey, have any of you seen my plate of spaghetti?"
Stan says: "No..."
Stan says: "But I bet Soos has."
Stan says: "You know how he likes to eat."
Dipper says: "This is a dark day."
Dipper says: "Thanks, Grunkle Stan."
Stan says: "See?"
Stan says: "Greater good."
Mabel says: "Aaaaah!"
Cuts to Mabel lying on her bed with Waddles says: "Mabel: Waddles, what am I gonna do about Grunkle Stan?"
Stan says: "What?"
Stan says: "What's going on?"
Stan says: "Huh?"
Stan says: "Mabel?"
Mabel says: "Quick question."
Mabel says: "What happened to Dipper's spaghetti plate?"
Stan says: "I ate it because I have little to no concern about other people's possessions or emotions."
Cut to that morning. Mabel is whispering in Dipper's ear.
Dipper says: "You what?"
Dipper says: "That seems like a horrible idea!"
Mabel says: "It's great!"
Mabel says: "Now he has to tell the truth."
Dipper says: "Hmmm."
Stan says: "Scrambled meat, here it is."
Dipper says: "Stan, what do you do in secret everyday during your lunch break?"
Stan says: "Usually, I spend the hour aggressively scratching myself in places I shouldn't mention."
Stan says: "Now I'm going to avoid making eye contact by pretending to read this newspaper and going to the bathroom without washing my hands."
Dipper says: "Eeeeeeewww!"
Mabel says: "Eeeeeeewww!"
Dipper says: "Well, that was disturbing."
Mabel says: "Don't worry, Dipper."
Mabel says: "The truth is always a good thing."
Unnamed man says: "Hey, excuse me."
Unnamed man says: "Do you think this t-shirt is my size?"
Stan says: "Never mind the t-shirt!"
Stan says: "Hey everyone, look at this guy's abnormal and unattractive face!"
Stan says: "Doing my taxes."
Dipper says: "Uh, Grunkle Stan, why did you write this?"
Stan says: "Because I regularly commit massive tax fraud."
Dipper says: "You might wanna..."
Dipper says: "tuck that one away there."
Dipper, Mabel and Stan are watching TV, where a man on a unicycle is juggling..
Dipper says: "Hahahahaha!"
Mabel says: "Hahahahaha!"
Stan says: "Sometimes, I think."
Stan says: "Is this all there is?"
Stan says: "Is life just some kind of horrific joke without a punch line?"
Stan says: "That we're all just biding our time until the sweet, sweet, release of death?"
Cut to later says: "Stan:  Kids, I think I have a growth forming on my back."
Cut to later says: "Just wanted to be honest with you guys."
Dipper says: "I can't take it anymore, Mabel!"
Dipper says: "We need to take those teeth out of his mouth."
Mabel says: "But then he'll be a liar again."
Dipper says: "Could it possibly be any worse than this?"
The doorbell rings. Dipper and Mabel run downstairs, where Stan is standing in the doorway with Sheriff Blubs and Deputy Durland.
Sheriff Blubs says: "So, after further investigation, it turns out that there is no Dr."
Sheriff Blubs says: "Medicine in Gravity Falls."
Deputy Durland says: "You better have a darn good explanation for this."
Stan says: "Oh and I do."
Stan says: "You see, I lied to you."
Stan says: "In addition I've been parking in handicapped spaces, shoplifting fireworks, and smuggling endangered animals across multiple state lines."
Stan says: "Also, you're fat."
Sheriff Blubs says: "Is all of this true?"
Dipper says: "No!"
Dipper says: "No, it's not true."
Dipper says: "Right, Mabel?"
Mabel says: "Uh, sirs, I have to be completely and totally honest with you."
Mabel says: "Our Great Uncle Stan is..."
Mabel says: "is..."
Mabel says: "Stan is.."
Mabel says: "secretly a crime fiction writer!"
Sheriff Blubs says: "What?"
Mabel says: "Yeah."
Mabel says: "He was just telling you about a character in his upcoming page turner, Crime Grandpa!"
Mabel says: "He's never committed a crime in his life."
Mabel says: "Also, have you lost weight?"
Sheriff Blubs says: "Finally!"
Sheriff Blubs says: "Someone noticed."
Deputy Durland says: "Wow, an author!"
Deputy Durland says: "Can you teach me how to read?"
Stan says: "What?"
Stan says: "Author?"
Mabel says: "Ha ha, writer, master of fiction."
Mabel says: "Good night, officers."
Dipper says: "Hey, you alright?"
Mabel says: "I can't believed I lied."
Dipper says: "Mabel, it was for the greater good."
Mabel says: "Yeah, the greater good."
Stan says: "Hello?"
Stan says: "Police station?"
Stan says: "I forgot to tell him about my tax fraud."
Stan says: "No, tax fraud."
Stan says: "What's gotten into you kids?"
Mabel says: "Oh wait, there it is."
Soos says: "Oh, sweet!"
Soos says: "My shoes!"
Stan says: "I like the part with the bear."
Stan says: "The rest of it seems pretty far-fetched."
Dipper says: "Mabel, we already know that story!"
Dipper says: "We just lived through it."
Soos says: "If we're living through that story right now, then how does it end?"
Dipper says: "Guys, do you see that?"
They are approaching some light.
Soos says: "What is that?"
Dipper says: "Oh no!"
Mabel says: "Where are we going?"
Stan says: "Not good!"
Stan says: "Where..."
Stan says: "where are we?"
Mabel says: "Look!"
Mabel says: "The Shack!"
Mabel says: "Which means..."
Mabel says: "we came right back out the top."
Dipper says: "And I don't think any time has passed."
Dipper says: "It must be some kind of wormhole."
Soos says: "Yeah, dude."
Soos says: "That sounds science-y enough to be true."
Stan says: "But that's impossible."
Stan says: "No one will believe us."
Mabel says: "Maybe this is one story we should keep to ourselves."
All says: "Agreed."
Mabel says: "He'll be fine."
Cuts to credits.
Stan says: "This is stupid."
