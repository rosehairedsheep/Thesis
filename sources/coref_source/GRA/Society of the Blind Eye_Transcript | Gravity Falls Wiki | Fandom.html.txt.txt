Soos says: "But the laptop has your name on it."
Dipper says: "What about this book?"
Dipper says: "Are you sure you didn't write it?"

Bud Gleeful says: "We've been usin' that ray on our own brains an awful lot."
Dipper says: "Why would you do all this?"
Dipper says: "What do you have to gain?"
Blind Ivan says: "As you have no doubt discovered, Gravity Falls is a town plagued with supernatural strangeness."
Blind Ivan says: "No one knew how to stop the things that went bump in the night, so our founder invented the next best thing: a way for us to forget."
Blind Ivan says: "We took it upon ourselves to help the troubled townsfolk by erasing the memories of the strange things they've seen."
Blind Ivan says: "Now the people of Gravity Falls go about their lives ignorant and happy, thanks to us."
Blind Ivan says: "And as a perk, we help ourselves forget things that trouble us."
Blind Ivan says: "Everyone has something they'd rather forget."
Blind Ivan says: "In fact, your own sister was about to use that ray on herself."
Blind Ivan says: "Isn't that right?"

Dipper says: "Don't you feel bad about that?"
Blind Ivan says: "Mmm, maybe a little."
Soos says: "Guys, if we're gonna forget everything, I got some stuff I wanna get off my chest."
Soos says: "Mabel, for half the summer, I thought your name was Maple, like the syrup."
Soos says: "No one corrected me!"
Mabel says: "I only love some of my stuffed animals, and the guilt is killing me!"
Dipper says: "Sometimes I use big words, and I don't actually know what they mean."
Dipper says: "I mean, I'm supposed to be the smart guy."
Dipper says: "If I'm not the smart guy, who am I?"
Wendy says: "Okay, I'm not actually laid back."
Wendy says: "I'm stressed, like, 24/7."
Wendy says: "Have you met my family?"
Blind Ivan says: "Oh, stop being a bunch of babies."
Blind Ivan says: "Owie!"
All says: "McGucket?!"

Sprott says: "Not gonna apologize for that."
Sprott says: "Maybe y'all should apologize for bein' a bunch of prudes."
All says: "Eew!"
Soos says: "Well, time to erase that forever."
Blind Ivan says: "Give me that tube."
Dipper says: "Never!"
Dipper says: "That memory belongs to McGucket."
Blind Ivan says: "The Society's secrets belong to us."
Dipper says: "NO!!"
Dipper says: "Oh my gosh!"
Dipper says: "Are you okay?!"
Dipper says: "!"
McGucket says: "Okay as I'll ever be!"
Dipper says: "What?"
Blind Ivan says: "Why..."
Blind Ivan says: "isn't..."
Blind Ivan says: "this..."
Blind Ivan says: "working?"
McGucket says: "Hit me with your best shot, Baldy."
McGucket says: "But my mind's been gone for thirty-odd years."
McGucket says: "You can't break what's already broken!"
McGucket says: "Say goodnight, Sally!"
Blind Ivan says: "Unhand us!"
Mabel says: "It isn't so fun being tied up, is it?"
Mabel says: "Hey, wanna draw on their faces?"
Blind Ivan says: "What?"
Mabel says: "Tra-la-la..."
Blind Ivan says: "Hey, stop that!"
Blind Ivan says: "That's not funny."
Dipper says: "It's pretty funny."
Soos says: "It's, like, objectively funny."
Blind Ivan says: "We'll have our revenge."
Blind Ivan says: "We'll never forget what you've done."
Dipper says: "Say cheese."
The members all protests til the ray gun fires, flashing the screen to white. Fade later to the outside of the Museum. The Society members, in normal clothes, are walking out.
Dipper says: "Thanks for visiting the Museum for Gold Miner Appreciation Night."
Dipper says: "Be sure to tip the gold miner on your way out."
Blind Ivan says: "I'm sorry, but what's my name?"
Blind Ivan says: "Where am I?"
Dipper says: "Oh, might have overdone that one."
Mabel says: "Your name is Toot-toot McBumbersnazzle."
Mabel says: "You're a traveling banjo minstrel, with a song in your heart, and funny tattoos on your head."
Blind Ivan says: "Yes, I am Toot-toot McBumbersnazzle."
Blind Ivan says: "Cheers!"
Blind Ivan says: ""Toot-toot is my name..."
Dipper says: "All right, McGucket, are you ready to see your memories?"
Dipper says: "Find out who you really are?"
McGucket says: "I'm not so sure."
McGucket says: "What if I don't like what I see?"
Mabel says: "We've come all this way."
Mabel says: "Go on."
McGucket puts the tube into the machine. An image pops up on the screen of McGucket, 30 years younger.
McGucket says: "My name is Fiddleford Hadron McGucket, and I wish to unsee what I have seen."
McGucket says: "Sweet sarsaparilla."
Younger McGucket says: "For the past year, I have been working as an assistant for a visiting researcher."
Younger McGucket says: "He has been cataloging his findings about Gravity Falls in a series of journals."
Younger McGucket says: "I helped him build a machine which he believed had the potential to benefit all mankind, but something went wrong."
Younger McGucket says: "I decided to quit the project."
Younger McGucket says: "But I lie awake at night, haunted by the thoughts of what I've done."
Younger McGucket says: "I believe I have invented a machine that can permanently erase these memories from my mind."
Mabel says: "Oh, McGucket, I'm so sorry."
McGucket says: "Aw, hush."
McGucket says: "You kids helped me get my memories back, just like you said."
Mabel says: "But did you want those memories back?"
McGucket says: "After all these years, I finally know who I am."
McGucket says: "Maybe I messed up in the past, but now that I seen what happened, I can begin to put myself together again."
McGucket says: "Thanks for opening my eyes."
Dipper says: "Still don't know what that means."
Dipper says: "So, wait."
Dipper says: "You weren't the author, but you worked with him."
Dipper says: "Do you remember who he was?"
McGucket says: "It's beginning to come back, but I need more time."
McGucket says: "And reading glasses."
McGucket says: "Heck!"
McGucket says: "I got some rememberin' to do."
Wendy says: "So Mabel, you still wanna erase those failed summer romances?"
Mabel says: "You know, no one likes having bad memories, but maybe it's better to remember the bad things and learn from them than to go all denial crazy trying to forget."
Wendy says: "That's some mature junk right there, Mabel."
Mabel says: "Yep."
Mabel says: "Miss Mature."
Mabel says: "That's me."
Mabel says: "Hey, you wanna help me vandalize this picture of my jerky ex-crush?"
Wendy says: "Hey, you know what?"
Wendy says: "Going on this big adventure actually made me get that stupid song out of my head."
Soos says: "Nice."
Wendy says: "Oh, come on!"
Credits says: "McGucket:  It's all so familiar."
Credits says: "It's almost like I can remember..."
