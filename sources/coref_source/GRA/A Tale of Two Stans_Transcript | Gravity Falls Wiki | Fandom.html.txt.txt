The episode opens to a bird standing on Glass Shard Beach. The bird walks off as Stan and Ford Pines, as children, run by.
Ford says: "Hehehehe!"
Ford says: "Wait up!"
Stan says: "Heh!"
Stan says: "Yeah, you should keep up."
Ford says: "I..."
Ford says: "I can keep up!"
Ford says: "Whoa!"
Stan says: "Neato!"
Ford says: "Mysterious, boarded-up cave!"
Ford says: "It might be filled with lost prehistoric life forms!"
Ford says: "Or mesoamerican gold!"
Stan says: "Uh, ladies first."
Stan says: "Ha ha!"
Stan says: "Good thing you've got your smarts, Poindexter."
Stan says: "I've got the other thing."
Stan says: "What is it called?"
Stan says: "Oh, right, punching!"
Stan says: "Cool."
Stan says: "Splinters!"
Ford says: "Whoa, it's so creepy in here!"
Stan says: "Hey, don't worry, bro."
Stan says: "Wherever we go, we go together."
Stan says: "Don't forget to leave our names so they know who owns the place."
Ford says: "Pines!"
Ford says: "Pines!"
Ford says: "Pines!"
Ford says: "Pines!"
Cut to theme song. Cut to the Mystery Shack in the present.
Stan says: "Finally!"
Stan says: "After all these long years of waiting, you're actually here!"
Stan says: "Brother!"
Stan says: "Oh!"
Stan says: "Ow!"
Stan says: "What the heck was that for?!"
Stan says: "!"
Ford says: "This was an insanely risky move: restarting the portal!"
Ford says: "Didn't you read my warnings?!"
Ford says: "!"
Stan says: "Warnings, schmarnings."
Stan says: "How's about maybe a thanks for saving you from what appears to be, I don't know, some kind of sci-fi sideburn dimension?"
Ford says: "Thank you?"
Ford says: "You really think I'm gonna thank you after what you DID THIRTY YEARS AGO?!"
Ford says: "!"
Stan says: "What I did?"
Stan says: "Why, you ungrateful..."
Stan says: "Ah!"
Mabel Pines says: "Hey, hi."
Mabel Pines says: "Mabel here."
Mabel Pines says: "Quick question: WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE?!"
Mabel Pines says: "!"
Ford says: "Stan, you didn't tell me there were children down here."
Ford says: "And some sort of large, hairless gopher?"
Soos Ramirez says: "Heh heh."
Soos Ramirez says: "I get that a lot."
Stan says: "They're your family, Poindexter."
Stan says: "Shermie's grandkids."
Ford says: "I-I have a niece and nephew?"
Ford says: "Greetings."
Ford says: "Do kids still say greetings?"
Ford says: "I haven't been in this dimension for a really long time."
Mabel says: "Whoa, a six-fingered handshake?"
Mabel says: "It's a full finger friendlier than normal!"
Ford says: "Heha, I like this kid."
Ford says: "She's weird."
Dipper Pines says: "I-I can't believe it."
Dipper Pines says: "You're the author of the journals!"
Ford says: "You've read my journals?"
Dipper says: "I haven't just read them; I've lived them!"
Dipper says: "Hmmpf!"
Dipper says: "No-no, false alarm."
Dipper says: "Hmmpf!"
Dipper says: "Just gotta ride it out!"
Ford says: "Listen, there'll be time for introductions later."
Ford says: "But first, tell me, Stan: are there any security breaches?"
Ford says: "Does anyone else know about this portal?"
Stan says: "No, just us."
Stan says: "Also maybe the entire U."
Stan says: "S."
Stan says: "government."
Ford says: "The what?!"
Ford says: "!"
Agent Powers says: "Fan out!"
Agent Powers says: "We're not going anywhere till we find Stan Pines and those kids!"
Ford says: "Okay."
Ford says: "It's all right."
Ford says: "We've got a while before they find this room."
Ford says: "We just need to lay low and think of a plan."
Mabel says: "Well, it looks like we're stuck down here for a while."
Mabel says: "Who wants to tell us their entire mysterious backstory?"
Ford says: "Yes, I have some questions about this myself, Stanley."
Dipper says: "Stanley?"
Mabel says: "But your name is Stanford."
Ford says: "Wait, you took my name?!"
Ford says: "!"
Ford says: "What have you been doing all these years, you knucklehead?!"
Ford says: "!"
Dipper says: "Yeah, Grunkle Stan, no more lies!"
Dipper says: "You owe us some answers: What's the deal with this portal?"
Dipper says: "Why did you keep this a secret?"
Mabel says: "And what happened between you and your brother?"
Soos says: "I hope all this aligns exactly with my fanfic, Stan."
Soos says: "If not, I will be very disappointed."
Stan says: "Okay okay okay, I have a lot of explaining to do."
Stan says: "It all started..."
Stan says: "a lifetime ago..."
Stan says: "nineteen sixty something."
Stan says: "Glass Shard Beach, New Jersey."
Stan says: "Dad was a strict man."
Stan says: "Tough as a cinderblock and not easily impressed."
Filbrick Pines says: "I'm not impressed."
Stan says: "Ma was a pathological liar, which served her well as a phone psychic."
Caryn Pines says: "That'll be 99 cents an hour..."
Caryn Pines says: "."
Caryn Pines says: "No, you're overpriced..."
Caryn Pines says: "."
Caryn Pines says: "Yeah, I predicted you were gonna hang up."
Stan says: "Whoooaa..."
Ford says: "A shipwrecked sailboat, possibly haunted by pirate ghosts!"
Stan says: "This is the greatest thing I've ever seen!"
Stan says: "And I've once seen a dead rat floatin' in a bucket!"
Ford says: "Hahaha, ew, what's wrong with you?"
Stan says: "Huh, you know what this thing's missin'?"
Ford says: "Flags."
Cut to the twins pushing the boat, which has their shirts hanging off the masts, down the beach. They are both badly sunburned.
Ford says: "Kings of New Jersey!"
Stan says: "Kings of New Jersey!"
Ford says: "Kings of New Jersey!"
Stan says: "Kings of New Jersey!"
Ford says: "Kings of New Jersey!"
Stan says: "Kings of New Jersey!"
Crampelter says: "Well, well, if it ain't the loser twins."
Crampelter says: "Nice boat."
Crampelter says: "Ya get it at the dump?"
Crampelter says: "Heheheheheheheh!"
Stan says: "You would know, Crampelter!"
Stan says: "Get lost!"
Crampelter says: "Listen, dorks, and listen good."
Crampelter says: "Ha, hahahaha!"
Crampelter says: "Dorks and losers..."
Stan says: "Hey."
Stan says: "Don't let those idiots get to you."
Ford says: "But I am a freak."
Ford says: "I just wonder if there's anywhere in the world where weirdos like me fit in."
Stan says: "Hey, chin up, buddy."
Stan says: "Look."
Stan says: "One of these days, you and me are gonna sail away from this dumb town."
Stan says: "We'll hunt for treasure, get all the girls, and be an unstoppable team of adventurers."
Ford says: "You really mean it?"
Stan says: "High six?"
Ford says: "High six."
Woman says: "Pines twins to the principal's office."
Woman says: "Pines twins to the principal's office."
Stan says: "Ah, great, what is it this time?"
Cut Ford and Stan starting to go into the principal's office. A woman at her desk stops them.
Woman says: "Not you; him."
Stan says: "Uh."
Principal says: "Now, Mr."
Principal says: "Pines, I'd like to speak with you very frankly if I may."
Filbrick says: "Very frankly is the only way I speak."
Principal says: "You have two sons: one of them is incredibly gifted, the other one is standing outside of this room and his name's Stanley."
Caryn says: "What are you saying?"
Principal says: "I'm saying your son, Stanford, is a GENIUS!"
Principal says: "All his teachers are going bananas over his science fair experiment!"
Principal says: "Ya ever heard of West Coast Tech?"
Principal says: "Best college in the country."
Principal says: "Their graduates turn science fiction into science FACT!"
Principal says: "The admissions team is visiting tomorrow to check out Stanford's experiment."
Principal says: "Your son may be a future millionare, Mr."
Principal says: "Pines."
Filbrick says: "I'm impressed."
Caryn says: "But what about our little free spirit, Stanley?"
Principal says: "That clown?"
Principal says: "At this rate he'll be lucky to graduate high school."
Principal says: "Look, there's a saltwater taffy store on the dock."
Principal says: "And somebody's gotta get paid to scrape the barnacles off of it."
Principal says: "Stanford's goin' places."
Principal says: "But hey, look on the bright side: at least you'll have one son here in New Jersey forever."
Stan says: "Heh."
Stan says: "Joke's on them if they think you wanna go to some stuffy college on the other side of the country."
Stan says: "Once we get the Stan O' War complete, it's gonna be beaches, babes, and international treasure hunting for us."
Ford says: "Look, Stan, I can't pass up a chance like this."
Ford says: "This school has cutting edge programs and multi-dimensional paradigm theory."
Stan says: "Beep boop."
Stan says: "I am a nerd robot."
Stan says: "That's you."
Stan says: "That's what you sound like."
Ford says: "Heheh."
Ford says: "Ah, well, if the college board isn't impressed with my experiment tomorrow, then okay, I'll do the treasure-hunting thing."
Stan says: "And if they are?"
Man says: "Alright, kid."
Man says: "Show us what ya got."
Ford says: "Okay!"
Ford says: "Well, what would you say if I told you that the future of technology was beneath this sheet?"
Man says: "I'd say that we wasted a car trip."
Ford says: "What?"
Ford says: "But it was stable yesterday!"
Ford says: "A fuse must have blown or something."
Ford says: "No, wait!"
Ford says: "Don't go!"
Ford says: "I worked so hard!"
Stan says: "Hey, what's the word, Sixer?"
Ford says: "Can you explain what this was doing next to my broken project?!"
Ford says: "!"
Stan says: "Ho-okay."
Ford says: "This was no accident, Stan; you did this!"
Ford says: "You did this because you couldn't handle me going to college on my own!"
Stan says: "Look, this was a mistake!"
Stan says: "Although if you think about it, maybe there's a silver lining."
Stan says: "Huh?"
Stan says: "Treasure hunting?"
Ford says: "Are you kidding me?"
Ford says: "Why would I want to do anything with the person who sabotaged my entire future?!"
Ford says: "!"
Filbrick says: "You did what, you knucklehead?"
Caryn says: "Stanley?"
Caryn says: "What's goin' on in here?"
Stan says: "Wait, no, I can explain; it was a mistake!"
Stan says: "What?!"
Stan says: "!"
Stan says: "Stanford, tell him he's bein' crazy!"
Stan says: "Thanks to one dumb mistake I had no brother, no home, no nothing."
Stan says: "But I had a plan to fix everything."
Cut back to the present.
Mabel says: "Oh!"
Mabel says: "This story's so sad!"
Mabel says: "I know what you two little broken teacups need: to hug it out!"
Mabel says: "Hug it out!"
Mabel says: "Hug train's comin' in the station."
Mabel says: "HUGAPOLOOZA!"
Mabel says: "TWO THOUSAND!"
Stan says: "Kid, will ya knock that off?"
Stan says: "I'm tryin' to tell my life story here."
Stan says: "I traveled the whole country, sometimes outside of it, always one step ahead of the law, looking for something that would be my big break."
Cut back to the present.
Mabel says: "Whoa."
Mabel says: "So that explains all the fake IDs."
Dipper says: "But, wait, what about you?"
Dipper says: "Did you end up going to your dream school?"
Ford says: "Not exactly."
Speaker says: "Alright, I know Backupsmore wasn't anyone's first choice, but what we lack in prestige, we make up for in mostly bug-free dorms!"
Speaker says: "I'm sure your families are proud, more or less."
Ford says: "A small lumber town in roadkill country, Oregon: Gravity Falls."
Ford says: "Hello?"
Ford says: "This is Stanford Pines."
Ford says: "I knew I'd have to record my findings."
Ford says: "I began to keep a journal..."
Dipper says: "THE JOURNALS!!!"
Cut back to the present. Everyone is staring at Dipper.
Dipper says: "Sorry, sorry,  just got excited there..."
Dipper says: "About the journals..."
Dipper says: "Keep-keep talking."
Ford says: "I began to keep a Journal..."
Ford says: "Just going to ignore that."
Ford says: "There were anomalies everywhere."
Ford says: "And the more I looked, the more I saw."
Ford says: "Fascinating, what did you say your name was?"
Gnome says: "Shmebulock..."
Gnome says: "Senior."
McGucket says: "Hello?"
McGucket says: "Fiddleford Computermajigs?"
McGucket says: ".."
McGucket says: "You say you're tryin' to build a transuniversal polydimensional metavortex?"
McGucket says: "Well that's mathematically feasible!"
McGucket says: "I reckon."
Ford says: "Many long nights were spent perfecting the machine."
Ford says: "It would be a crowning achievement of my studies."
Ford says: "An answer to the source of this town's anomalies."
Ford says: "What is it?"
Ford says: "Is it working?"
Ford says: "What did you see?!"
Ford says: "!"
McGucket says: "Ahh!"
McGucket says: "VOTMZRIG IVSKRX OORY."
Ford says: "Fiddleford?"
McGucket says: "When Gravity Falls and earth becomes sky, fear the beast with just one eye."
Ford says: "Fiddleford, get a hold of yourself, you're not making any sense."
McGucket says: "This machine is dangerous."
McGucket says: "You'll bring about the end of the world with this."
McGucket says: "Destroy it before it destroys us all!"
Ford says: "I can't destroy this; it's my life's work!"
McGucket says: "I fear we've unleashed a grave danger on the world."
McGucket says: "One I'd just as soon forget."
McGucket says: "I quit!"
Ford says: "Fine!"
Ford says: "I'll do it without you!"
Ford says: "I don't need you!"
Ford says: "I don't need anyone!"
Ford says: "I was in over my head, and feared I was losing my sanity."
Ford says: "I needed help."
Ford says: "Someone I could trust."
Stan says: "Well, I can always count on you for a warm welcome."
Ford says: "Stanley, did anyone follow you?"
Ford says: "Anyone at all?"
Stan says: "Eh, hello to you, too, pal."
Stan says: "Ah!"
Stanley says: "Ah!"
Stanley says: "Hey!"
Stanley says: "What is this?"
Ford says: "Sorry, I just had to make sure you weren't..."
Ford says: "uh, it's nothing."
Ford says: "Come in, come in."
Stan says: "Uh, you gonna explain what's going on, here?"
Stan says: "You're acting like Mom after her tenth cup of coffee."
Stan says: "Hey, uh, easy there."
Stan says: "Let's talk this through, okay?"
Ford says: "I have something to show you."
Ford says: "Something you won't believe."
Stan says: "Look, I've been around the world, okay?"
Stan says: "Whatever it is, I'll understand."
Stan says: "There is nothing about this I understand."
Ford says: "It's a trans-universal gateway, a punched hole through a weak spot in our dimension."
Ford says: "I created it to unlock the mysteries of the universe."
Ford says: "But it could just as easily be harnessed for terrible destruction."
Ford says: "That's why I shut it down and hid my journals, which explained how to operate it."
Ford says: "There's only one journal left."
Ford says: "And you are the only person I can trust to take it."
Ford says: "Take this book, get on a boat, and sail as far away as ya can!"
Ford says: "To the edge of the Earth!"
Ford says: "Bury it where no one can find it!"
Stan says: "That's it?!"
Stan says: "!"
Stan says: "You finally wanna see me after ten years, and it's to tell me to get as far away from you as possible!"
Stan says: "?"
Ford says: "Stanley, you don't understand what I'm up against!"
Ford says: "What I've been through!"
Stan says: "No, no."
Stan says: "You don't understand what I've been through!"
Stan says: "I've been to prison in three different countries!"
Stan says: "I once had to chew my way out of the trunk of a car!"
Stan says: "You think you've got problems?"
Stan says: "I've got a mullet, Stanford!"
Stan says: "Meanwhile, where have you been?"
Stan says: "Living it up in your fancy house in the woods!"
Stan says: "Selfishly hoarding your college money, because you only care about yourself."
Ford says: "I'm selfish?"
Ford says: "I'm selfish, Stanley?"
Ford says: "How can you say that after costing me my dream school?!"
Ford says: "!"
Ford says: "I'm giving you a chance to do the first worthwhile thing in your life and you won't even listen!"
Stan says: "Well, listen to this: you want me to get rid of this book?"
Stan says: "Fine, I'll get rid of it right now!"
Ford says: "No!"
Ford says: "You don't understand!"
Stan says: "You said you wanted me to have it so I'll do what I want with it!"
Ford says: "My research!"
Stan says: "You want it back, you're gonna have to try harder than that!"
The portal turns on.
Stan says: "You left me behind, you jerk!"
Stan says: "It was supposed to be us forever, you ruined my life!"
Ford says: "You ruined your own life!"
Ford says: "Stanley!"
Ford says: "Oh my gosh I'm so sorry!"
Stan punches Ford, who stumbles backward and trips over the lever. Stan follows him.
Stan says: "Some brother you turned out to be."
Stan says: "You care more about your dumb mysteries than your family?"
Stan says: "Well then YOU CAN HAVE 'EM."
Stan says: "Whoa, whoa, hey, what's going on?"
Ford says: "Stanley!"
Ford says: "Stanley, help me!"
Stan says: "Oh, no, what do I do?!!"
Stan says: "!!"
Ford says: "Stanley!"
Ford says: "Stanley!"
Ford says: "Do something!"
Ford says: "STANLEY!"
A flash of white engulfs everything. When it fades, Stan is lying on the floor.
Stan says: "Stanford?"
Ford's glasses fall onto the floor.
The portal turns off.
Ma says: "Just the bread, then, there, stranger?"
Ma says: "That'll be 99 cents."
Susan says: "Hey, that's no stranger."
Susan says: "That must be the mysterious science guy that lives in the woods!"
A crowd gathers.
Toby Determined says: "I've heard strange stories about that old shack."
Daryl Blubs says: "Yeah!"
Daryl Blubs says: "Mysterious lights and spooky experiments."
Pa says: "Gosh, I'd pay anything to see what kind of shenanigans you get up to in there."
Susan says: "Oh, me too!"
Susan says: "Do you ever give any tours?"
Stan says: "No."
Stan says: "Really I-  Yes, I do give tours!"
Stan says: "Ten..."
Stan says: "nah-no..."
Stan says: "fifteen bucks a person!"
Crowd cheers and holds up money.
Susan says: "Sir!"
Susan says: "What did you say your name was, you man of mystery?"
Stan says: "Oh, uh, Stan..."
Stan says: "ford."
Stan says: "Stanford Pines."
Stan says: "Behold, the um, nerdy science box."
Susan says: "Ah!"
Susan says: "My eye!"
Stan says: "Uh, I can assure you, that is in no way permanent."
Susan says: "I paid fifteen dollars for this!"
Susan says: "?"
Crowd begins muttering.
Stan says: "Uhh..."
Stan says: "they never made it out aliiiivve."
Stan says: "Heheh."
Stan says: "Right?"
The crowd laughs.
Susan says: "That's funny."
Stan says: "I couldn't risk anyone learning the truth and sabotaging my mission, so I lied to everyone: the town, my family, your parents, even you kids."
Dipper says: "So all this time you were just trying to save your brother."
Dipper says: "Grunkle Stan, I'm so sorry I didn't believe you."
Stan says: "That's okay, kid."
Stan says: "I probably wouldn't have believed me either."
Agent says: "I heard talking!"
Agent says: "It was coming from downstairs!"
Stan says: "Oh no, it's too late, the agents are comin' for us!"
Mabel says: "What do we do?!"
Mabel says: "!"
Soos says: "Aw, man."
Soos says: "I was so spellbound by your dramatic tale I forgot all about those dudes."
Dipper says: "Wait, forget."
Dipper says: "That's it!"
Dipper says: "I think I know a way we might be able to defeat those agents!"
Ford says: "Of course!"
Ford says: "I don't know how you got a hold of one of these but, this is perfect!"
Ford says: "If I can just amplify the signal to a radio headset frequency..."
Ford says: "There."
Ford says: "Now everyone PLUG YOUR EARS!"
Ford says: "GET DOWN!"
Ford says: "NOW!"
Everyone crouches and plugs their ears. Cut to Agent Powers and Trigger at the doorway.
Agent Trigger says: "Sir!"
Agent Trigger says: "Looks like there's a hidden door behind the vending machine!"
Powers says: "Excellent!"
Powers says: "Get me Washington on Line 1!"
Powers says: "I've been practicing sounds of excitement for this very occasion."
Powers says: "Hey, do you hear that?"
A wave pulses through the shack and yard.
Powers says: "What?"
Powers says: "Where am I?"
Powers says: "Why am I standing in front of some sort of goofy fun knick-knack house?"
Ford says: "According to this very real report, the power surges in Gravity Falls were actually due to radiation from an unreported meteor shower."
Ford says: "A total embarrassment for your whole department."
Ford says: "Luckily I'm here to take this mess off your hands, but I'll need of all your..."
Ford says: "floppy disks, and 8-tracks..."
Ford says: "right?"
Powers says: "Uh, everything about this case is contained on this drive."
Ford says: "Well, what are you waiting for, a kiss on the cheek?"
Ford says: "Get out of here before I have your butts court-martialed!"
Powers says: "Uhh, yes sir."
Powers says: "Apologies, sir."
The government agents all leave. Ford gives Gompers the flash drive, and the goat runs away with it in his mouth.
Mabel says: "Great uncle Stanford, that was amazing!"
Stan says: "Let's not go crazy; it was serviceable."
Ford says: "Thank you, kids, but please, call me Ford."
Dipper says: "Sure!"
Dipper says: "Thanks, Great Uncle Ford."
Dipper says: "So, uh,  would you mind if I ask you a couple billion questions about Gravity Falls?"
Ford says: "Um, well I-uh..."
Stan says: "All right, kids, it's been a long day and me and my brother have a lot to talk about."
Stan says: "Why don't you hit the hay, huh?"
Dipper says: "But, it's the author!"
Stan says: "I said."
Stan says: "Hit."
Stan says: "The hay!"
Soos says: "I'll just..."
Soos says: "let myself out."
Soos says: "Wendy, I've got something amazing to tell you."
Soos says: "Clear the next fourteen hours!"
Cut to night. Stan and Ford are looking at themselves in the mirror.
Stan says: "Look at us."
Stan says: "When did we become old men?"
Ford says: "You look like Dad."
Stan says: "Ugh, uck, don't say that."
Ford says: "Okay, Stanley, here's the deal."
Ford says: "You can stay here the rest of the summer to watch the kids."
Ford says: "I'll stay down in the basement and try to contain any remaining damage."
Ford says: "But when the summer's over, you give me my house back, you give me my name back, and this Mystery Shack junk is over forever."
Ford says: "You got it?"
Stan says: "You really aren't gonna thank me, are you?"
Cut to Dipper and Mabel in their room. Mabel is standing by the door.
Mabel says: "Did you hear what they said?"
Mabel says: "I think Grunkle Ford said they're gonna buy us puppies made of ice cream."
Mabel says: "Might be wishful thinking, though."
Dipper says: "I don't know if this is good or bad."
Dipper says: "I wanted to meet the author, but..."
Mabel says: "Yeah."
Mabel says: "I liked the way things were here before."
Mabel says: "Just us and Stan and the occasional goblin-monster."
Dipper says: "Eh, I'm sure they'll work things out."
Mabel says: "Dipper, you don't think we'll turn out like Stan and Ford, do you?"
Dipper says: "Well."
Dipper says: "What do you mean?"
Mabel says: "I mean, they used to be best friends, but then they got all stupid."
Mabel says: "Can you promise me you won't get stupid?"
Dipper says: "I'm not stupider than you, dum-dum."
Mabel says: "Good night, stupid."
Dipper says: "Good night, stupid."
End credits says: "Wendy is sitting up in her bed at 3 in the morning with Soos on the phone."
Soos says: "Okay, okay, so it turns out that the second Stan, the Stan that, we know, was actually, Stanley but the first Stan, was Stanford, but we didn't know, until, that Stanford came out of the portal, which was built by Stanford, but then Stanley pretended to be Stanford, he, did the portal, cause he's Stan, but he's not Stan."
Wendy Corduroy says: "Soos, it's three in the morning."
Soos says: "Okay, okay, I understand."
Soos says: "Anyway, act two: Stan started..."
