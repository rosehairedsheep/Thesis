Stan says: "Oh!"
Stan says: "Oh, look at him!"

Stan says: "What the heck do you think you're doing?"
Mabel says: "Business!"
Mabel says: "Ching ching ching!"
Stan says: "Listen, kid."
Stan says: "You don't make money by giving stuff away."
Stan says: "You're off of register duty!"
Stan says: "No buts except for yours out the door."
Stan says: "Now shut your yap and get to work!"
Mabel says: "Grunkle Stan, whatever happened to "please" and "thank you"?"
Mabel says: "Hmm?"
Mabel says: "Oh wait."
Mabel says: "Here they are!"
Stan says: "Ugh."
Stan says: ""Please" never made me any money, kid."
Stan says: "In fact, just saying the word is giving me a burning sensation."
Stan slaps the "Thank you" sticker on Soos' back as he sweeps by. Soon after that, Dipper comes in.
Dipper says: "Grunkle Stan, why do I have to wear this wolf costume?"
Dipper says: "I think I'm getting hookworm."
Stan says: "Yep."
Stan says: "Gluing dog hair to your body will do that."
Dipper says: "You've got all these dumb, fake exhibits in the Shack."
Dipper says: "Meanwhile, I've seen actual, amazing things in the forest every day!"
Dipper says: "What if you hunted down a real attraction instead of lying to people for a living?"
Mabel says: "And you should be nicer to your employees, too!"
Dipper says: "Yeah!"
Stan says: "Look, you guys got a problem with how I run the Shack, take it up with the complaints department."
Stan says: "Zing!"
Mabel says: "I am going to write them such a letter!"
Cuts to Mabel, Dipper, Wendy, and Soos painting the Mystery Shack sign a glittery pink.

Stan says: "Also large birds."
A bald eagle attacks Soos and he tries to run away from it.
Stan says: "Ha ha!"
Stan says: "That's funny."
Dipper says: "Okay, is it just me, or is having Grunkle Stan as a boss seriously the worst?"
Wendy says: "I know, right?"
Wendy says: "Why do we even put up with it?"
Soos says: "I gave him a suggestion to improve the Shack once."
Soos says: "I had this idea where I could be, like, the Mystery Shack mascot: Questiony the Question Mark."
Soos says: "I ask people questions, you know."
Soos says: "Do the question dance."
Mabel says: "That sounds amazing!"
Wendy says: "Oh, cool!"

Stan says: "Ah!"
Mabel says: "Grunkle Stan, you've gone too far this time!"
Mabel says: "Did you seriously tell Soos not to follow his hopes and dreams because he "couldn't handle it?"
Stan says: "Look, kid, let me break it down for you."
Stan says: "Being a boss is about commanding respect."
Stan says: "If you give people everything they ask for, they'll walk all over ya."
Mabel says: "No way!"
Mabel says: "I bet you'd make way more money being nice then being a big grumpy grump to everyone all the time."
Stan says: "Ha!"
Stan says: "You think you know more about business than I do?"
Stan says: "You think you could wear this hat?"
Mabel says: "Yeah!"
Mabel says: "'Cause I give people respect!"
Mabel says: "And glittery stickers!"
Stan says: "Ha!"
Stan says: "I'd make more money on vacation then you would, running this place!"
Mabel says: "Then why don't you go on vacation?"
Stan says: "Interesting..."
Stan says: "All right, I'm a wagering man."
Stan says: "3 days."
Stan says: "72 hours."
Stan says: "You have to wear this "LOSER" shirt all summer!"
Mabel says: "Fine."
Mabel says: "But if I win I get to be the boss for the rest of the summer!"
Mabel says: "Plus, you gotta sing an apology song with lyrics by me!"
Mabel says: "Mabel."
Stan says: "Whoa ho!"
Stan says: "You got yourself a deal, missy!"
Mabel says: "No, you got yourself a deal!"
Stan says: "Deal!"

Mabel says: "Being a better boss than Stan will be a cinch."
Mabel says: "Profit, here we come!"
Dipper says: "You broke the jar."
Mabel says: "We'll get a new one."
Dipper says: "I guess I shouldn't be too worried."
