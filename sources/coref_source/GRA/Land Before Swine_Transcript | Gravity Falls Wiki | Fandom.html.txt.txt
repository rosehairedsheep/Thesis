Soos says: "Actually, no one knows how to pronounce it because nobody was alive back in dinosaur days, so uh..."
Soos says: "Wow."
Dipper says: "Mabel."
Dipper says: "We've got to talk."
Dipper says: "This is a really high-stakes mission and I'm a little worried about Soos coming along on this one."

McGucket says: "Howdy, friends!"
Dipper says: "What are YOU doing out here?"
McGucket says: "You'll never believe me!"
McGucket says: "Now I was doin' my hourly hootnanny- Deedly doo ding dang!"
Stan says: "Ugh, this guy."
McGucket says: "When this enormous wing-ly critter stole my musical spoons and flew lickety-split into the abandoned mines down yonder!"
Stan says: "Looks kinda hairy down there."
Mabel says: "C'mon, Grunkle Stan, you can handle it!"
Mabel says: "You punched a pterodactyl in the face, remember?"
Stan says: "Oh yeah!"
Stan says: "Heh heh, I did do that, didn't I."
Stan says: "Heh..."
Stan says: "heh heh heh..."

Old Man McGucket says: "Need someone to tag along and tell weird personal stories?"
Stan says: "No thanks."
Cut to everyone, including Old Man McGucket, climbing down a rope into the depths of the mine.
McGucket says: "So there I am, fighting a raccoon for the same piece of meat, when our mouths get close and we kiss accidentally!"
Stan says: "You can't take a hint, can you."
McGucket says: "Nope!"
Shows rope fraying through, then breaking, spilling everyone to the ground below.
Dipper says: "Whoa."
Dipper says: "These plants look all Jurrasic-y."
Soos says: "Huh!"
Soos says: "This little fella smells like battery acid!"
Soos says: "Aaaugh!"
Soos says: "Looks like I lost my sense of smell, ha ha!"
Mabel says: "Oh, Waddles."
Mabel says: "We're gonna find you."
They walk into a tunnel, where Dipper's lantern light falls on a petrified T-Rex and everyone screams, then calms down and gasps at all the dinosaurs.
Dipper says: "They're trapped inside the tree sap!"
Dipper says: "That's how they survived for 65 million years!"
Dipper says: "Whoa."
Dipper says: "The summer heat must be melting them loose!"
Stan says: "Holy moley!"
Stan says: "Forget the cornicorn, this is the attraction of a lifetime!"
Stan says: "I could bring people down here and turn this into some sort of theme park!"
Stan says: "Jurassic..."
Stan says: "Sap Hole!"
Soos says: "Uh, dudes..."
Dipper says: "Maybe..."
Dipper says: "we should keep moving."
Stan says: "This could be a gold mine!"
Stan says: "Velvety-rope type deal there, ticket booth here, ha!"
Stan says: "I should have put that pig outside ages ago!"
Mabel says: "Wait- what did you just say?"
Stan says: "Hm?"
Stan says: "What's that?"
Mabel says: "You said the dinosaur flew INTO the house."
Stan says: "No!"
Mabel says: "You put Waddles outside, then you lied to me about it!"
Mabel says: "And now thanks to you, my pig could be dead!"
Mabel says: "WADDLES COULD BE DEAD!"
Stan says: "Look, he's an animal."
Stan says: "He belongs outside!"
Mabel says: "No, that's it."
Mabel says: "Grunkle Stan, I am never ever speaking to you again!"
Stan says: "Look, you can't be serious."
Mabel says: "Oh, is someone talking right now?"
Mabel says: "Because I can't hear them!"
Stan says: "Kid!"
Mabel says: "LA LA LA LA LA!"
Mabel says: "I can't hear anyone!"
Mabel says: "No one's talking to me!"
Soos says: "Guys, guys, don't fight!"
Soos says: "Why can't you be more like me and Dipper?"
Soos says: "Look, everything's gonna be cool."
Soos says: "All we gotta do to find the pig is follow this here yarn!"
Soos says: "Which- which cave was it again?"
Dipper says: "Arghhh!"
Dipper says: "Soos, you lost the trail!"
Soos says: "Hey, come on."
Soos says: "We'll find our way, TRUST me."
Soos whacks Dipper playfully on the back, causing the lantern Dipper is holding to fly out of his hands and break.
Soos says: "..."
Soos says: "Sorry, dude."
Dipper says: "Ugh!"
Dipper says: "That is it!"
Dipper says: "See, this is why I didn't want to bring you along!"
Soos says: "Look!"
Soos says: "-What -what do you mean?"
Dipper says: "I MEAN, this is really important to Mabel, and you keep screwing everything up!"
Dipper says: "You ruined our photograph, and now you got us hopelessly lost!"
Soos says: "But we're p-terodactyl bros!"
Soos says: "I made t-shirts!"
Dipper says: "It's pronounced pterodactyl!"
Dipper says: "And these shirts are useless, they're gigantic!"
Soos says: "I have a different body type, dude!"
Dipper says: "Oh, so it's my fault?"
The whole group deteriorates into an argument as Mabel and Stan start arguing again.
McGucket says: "Hey!"
McGucket says: "Cheer up, fellers!"
McGucket says: "I fixed your lantern!"
All says: "AAAAAAAAUGH!"
McGucket says: "AAAAAAAAUGH!"
McGucket says: "Heh heh."
McGucket says: "What- what're we doing?"
McGucket says: "YEEEEEEHAW!"
McGucket says: "We found a pterodactyl!"
The pterodactyl shrieks and starts chasing the gang down the narrow tunnel on all fours. It gets caught for a couple of seconds in a doorway, allowing them to hide behind some rocks before the pterodactyl comes.
Dipper says: "Guys, we need a plan to get out of here."
Stan says: "Okay, okay."
Soos says: "I like it!"
Stan says: "..."
Stan says: "and we use Soos as a human sacrifice!"
Soos says: "I like it!"
Stan says: "What do you say, Mabel?"
Mabel says: "Hmph."
Stan says: "Ah, come on, you can't stop talking to me forever."
Dipper says: "Yeah, Mabel, we have to work together here."
Soos says: "Oh, what, you want to work with Mabel but not your buddy, Soos?"
Soos, Dipper, Stan start to argue to each other.
Waddles says: "WHONK!"
Waddles says: "WHONK!"
Mabel says: "Wait, did you hear that?"
Mabel see Waddles in a nest.
Mabel says: "Waddles!"
Mabel smiles and runs to the nest.
Soos says: "Oh, wait, kid."
Dipper says: "Mabel!"
Stan says: "Are you nuts?"
Mabel says: "Oh, is someone speaking?"
Mabel says: "Because I can't hear anything!"
McGucket says: "Oh no!"
McGucket says: "She's gone deaf with fear!"
Dipper says: "Mabel, come back here!"
Everyone runs onto the mining cart track over to the nest.
Mabel says: "Waddles!"
Mabel says: "Oh, my Waddles!"
Mabel says: "I'll never lose you again!"
Dipper says: "Uh..."
Dipper says: "Mabel?"
Mabel says: "Shh."
Mabel says: "You're safe now."
Dipper says: "Mabel, quick!"
Dipper says: "We gotta- now we gotta get out of here!"
A huge shadow passes overhead and Waddles squeals in terror.
Waddles says: "WHOOONNNKK!"
Waddles immediately runs away.
Mabel says: "Waddles, wait!"
Waddles keep running.
Waddles says: "WHOONK!"
Waddles says: "WHOONK!"
Stan says: "Huh?"
Waddles jumps into Stan.
Stan says: "Ah!"
Waddles says: "WHOONK!"
Waddles says: "WHOONK!"
Stan says: "Get off me, you dumb pig!"
The pterodactyl swoops down on Stan and Waddles, screeching.
Dipper says: "Look out!"
Everyone screams as the pterodactyl knocks Stan off the mining track and down into a deep chasm filled with prehistoric plants.
Mabel says: "Oh no!"
Dipper says: "Stan!"
Soos says: "Mr."
Soos says: "Pines!"
Stan says: "Aaaaaaaaugh!"
Stan says: "Ugh."
Stan says: "Yeah, you would enjoy this."
Stan says: "Aaaaaah!"
Stan says: "Huh?"
The pterodactyl drops Stan's fez in front of Dipper, Mabel, and Soos, who are crouching terrified in the pterodactyl's nest. They gasp.
Mabel says: "Guys!"
Mabel says: "We gotta save them!"
Dipper says: "McGucket, do you have an invention that can distract the pterodactyl?"
McGucket says: "Do I!"
McGucket says: "?"
McGucket says: "Nope."
Everyone gasps as the solitairy pterodactyl egg cracks, falls on its side, and opens to reveal a baby pterodactyl, which makes a squeaking peeping noise.
Mabel says: "Awwww!"
McGucket says: "Well, welcome to the world, little feller-  AAAAUGH!"
Meanwhile, Stan and Waddles are hiding under a massive mushroom. Stan looks up as the pterodactyl flies over them.
Stan says: "The dumb thing must be hungry."
Stan says: "I guess it's you or me, pig."
Stan says: "What are you looking at?"
Stan says: "Aw come on, don't give me that look!"
Stan says: "What am I supposed to do, let it eat me?"
Stan says: "Argh!"
Stan says: "Oh, I get it."
Stan says: "You're trying to guilt me."
Stan says: "Well it ain't working, pal."
Stan says: "Who cares if you're Mabel's favorite thing in the world?"
Stan says: "I can live without the kid talking to me all the time!"
Stan says: "..."
Stan says: "Telling me her jokes..."
Stan says: "makin' me laugh..."
Stan says: "YOU WANT THIS PIG?!"
Stan says: "!"
Waddles says: "WHOONK!"
Stan says: "THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET THROUGH ME, YOU FLYING DEVIL!"
Stan says: "COME AND GET ME!"
Soos says: "Ah dude!"
Soos says: "Did he really just eat that prospecter guy?"
Soos says: "That is messed up!"
The baby pterodactyl spits out McGucket's hat. Then old man McGucket comes up from the pterodactyl's neck and peeks out from the mouth.
Old man McGucket says: "I'm okay!"
The baby pterodactyl swallows McGucket again. Mabel, Dipper and Soos backs off.
Dipper says: "What do we do, what do we do!"
Soos says: "We have to get in a straight line."
Dipper says: "What?"
Soos says: "The pterodactyl's eyes are so far apart, that if you stand right in front of it, it can't see you!"
Dipper says: "Soos, you've been wrong about stuff all day."
Soos says: "Dude, look."
Soos says: "I-I know I've messed up a lot."
Soos says: "I could be sort of clumsy and.."
Soos says: "It's not always as loveable as I think."
Soos says: "But please, as my friend, just trust me on this one!"
Dipper looks at the baby pterodactyl and looks at Soos. Dipper gives a smile and nods at Soos.
Soos says: "Get behind me, dudes!"
Dipper and Mabel stands behind Soos. They move quietly. When the pterodactyl looks at them, they make a straight line. In the pterodactyl's eyes, they are out of it's vision.
Mabel says: "It's working!"
They walk on the track, making a line. when the pterodactyl turns it's head, they jump to the other line of the track. After they complete their crossing, the pterodactyl turns it's attention to eating stuff. The Pines twins and Soos rests behind the rocks. They all sigh.
Dipper says: "Soos, you did it!"
A cry of a pterodactyl is heard.
All says: "Huh?"
Looking up, a pterodactyl is flying around and a punching sound is heard.
Dipper says: "Was that.."
Dipper says: "?"
Mabel says: "Stan?"
Close-up to the pterodactyl. Stan is punching it in is face in slow-mo. Mabel finds Waddles.
Mabel says: "Waddles!"
Dipper says: "He's punching him in the face!"
Stan says: "From heck's heart I stabeth thee!!"
The pterodactyl hits the cliff, crashes to the ground and Stan climbs up the cliff.
Mabel stares at Stan delightly with Stan's hat.
Stan says: "Here's your pig, kido."
Mabel says: "Waddles!"
Mabel says: "You saved him for me!"
Stan says: "Some times you just gotta.."
Stan says: "LOOK OUT!"
They all start to run. The pterodactyl snaps at Dipper and ripped his vest. Back at the entrance, they discover the rope to climb up was cut.
Stan says: "We're trapped!"
Dipper sees the geyser pushing the rock up.
Dipper says: "Quick!"
Dipper says: "The geyser could shoot us back up!"
They all climb in the geyser and the pterodactyl is approaching, but the geyser won't pump.
Dipper says: "C'mon.."
Dipper says: "Go, go!"
The pterodactyl roars and everyone screams.
Soos says: "Bros before dinos!"
The geyser pumps them up and they land into the buliding all wet. The building collapses and covers the hole. Cuts to the Pines leaving the building.
Mabel says: "I can't believe you did all that for Waddles!"
Stan says: "Ah, well."
Stan says: "I can't have my favorite niece not talking to me."
Stan says: "And if I gotta leap onto a pterodactyl and punch him in the face, then that's what I gotta do."
Mabel says: "That's kinda sappy."
Stan says: "W-what?"
Stan says: "That's how I feel!"
Mabel says: "No, I mean.."
Stan says: "Oh, yeah."
Cut to the car. At the back seat, Mabel, Waddles and Stan are sleeping. Zoom out to the front seat, which Dipper and Soos are sitting.
Dipper says: "Check it out!"
Dipper says: "Soos, look!"
Soos says: "A real dinosaur tooth?"
Soos says: "That's awesome!"
Dipper says: "Not as awesome as you saving us back there."
Dipper says: "Pterodactyl bros?"
Soos says: "Pterodactyl bros."
Soos says: "Whoosh!"
Soos says: "Hey!"
Soos says: "I pronounced it right that time!"
Dipper says: "Think we need to worry about the rest of those dinosaurs?"
Soos says: "I doubt it."
The camera pans back to the house. From the hole, old man McGucket pops out.
McGucket says: "I ate my way through a dino-sour!"
Cuts to credits. Dipper and Soos are watching tv.
Bobby Renzobbi says: "Hey, I'm Bobby Renzobbi."
Bobby Renzobbi says: "Are your arms jealous of your legs?"
Bobby Renzobbi says: "Then you need "Arm Pants!"
Bobby Renzobbi says: "" The pants that you wear on your arms!"
Dipper says: "Yeesh."
Dipper says: "Who actually buys these informercial stuff?"
Soos says: "I know, right?"
Soos says: "Cancel the order, cancel the order!"
The camera turns to Mabel, Waddles and Stan. They are playing poker.
Stan says: "Snorting!"
Stan says: "That's his tell!"
Stan says: "I fold."
Mabel says: "Tough luck, sucker!"
Mabel says: "Waddles was bluffing."
Stan says: "What?"
Stan says: "I had 4 aces!"
Stan says: "That pig is a wizard!"
Waddles eats his cards.
Stan says: "Look at him."
Stan says: "He's taunting me!"
Mabel says: "I've been cheating the last 8 turns."
Stan says: "Ha ha, that's my girl!"
