Beardy says: "It's Beardy."
Dipper says: "You keep telling me that being a man means doing all these tasks, and being aggro all the time, but I'm starting to think that stuff's malarkey."
The manotaurs gasp.
Dipper says: "You heard me, malarkey."
Dipper says: "So maybe I don't have muscles, or hair in certain places, and.."
Dipper says: "sure, when a girly pop song comes on the radio, sometimes, I leave it on!"
Dipper says: "'Cause dang it, top 40 hits are in the top 40 for a reason!"
