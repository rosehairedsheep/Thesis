Episode starts at Wendy's house, where Dipper and Wendy are watching Nearly Almost Dead But Not Quite!
Trixandra says: "What do we do, Chadley?"
Trixandra says: "I thought they were dead!"
Chadley says: "Far worse, Trixandra!"
Chadley says: "They're..."
Chadley says: "Nearly Almost Dead But Not Quite!"
Dipper Pines says: "Man, these movies are a lot less scary when you actually fought real zombies."
Wendy Corduroy says: "They're slow!"
Wendy Corduroy says: "Just power-walk away from them!"
Dipper says: "How much you want to bet that guy dies first?"
Chadley says: "Aah!"
Chadley says: "My face is being eaten a lot!"
Wendy says: "Chadley ain't pretty no more."
Wendy's phone buzzes.
Wendy says: "One second."
Wendy says: "Ugh, another text from Robbie!"
Dipper says: "Oh, yeah!"
Dipper says: "Robbie."
Dipper says: "How's, uh, how's all that going?"
Wendy says: "Ugh, I'm over him, I just wish he was over me!"
Wendy says: "Just look at these texts."
Wendy says: "Winky frown?"
Wendy says: "What does that even mean?"
Dipper says: "And you're not..."
Dipper says: "not like, seeing any other guys or..."
Wendy says: "Of course I am, meet my new boyfriend, dude."
Dipper says: "wanted to join me and Mabel on this mystery hunt?"
Dipper says: "Tomorrow?"
Dipper says: "Conspiracy stuff and all that?"
Wendy says: "Yeah, dude."
Wendy says: "I love doing all that junk with friends."
Wendy says: "Yo Chadley, watch out!"
Dipper says: "Yeah, that's what we are."
Dipper says: "Friends."
Wendy says: "Dude, you're laying on my bra."
Dipper says: "Hu—"
Dipper says: "?"
Cut to theme song.
Workmen are fixing up the nearly destroyed Mystery Shack.
Stan Pines says: "Hey, easy with that, it's genuine plastic!"
Stan Pines says: "And repave the cracks in the parking lot while you're at it!"
Stan Pines says: "I don't want my car falling into China!"
Workman says: "Mr."
Workman says: "Pines, what exactly caused all this damage?"
Workman says: "I need to write a report."
Stan says: "Uhhh, big woodpecker."
Gift shop sign falls over.
Stan says: "Keep the change."
Stan says: "..."
Stan says: "I'm winking under my eye patch."
Workman says: "Works for me."
Stan says: "Now where'd those kids run off to?"
Dipper, Mabel, and Soos are standing around the tree that contained Journal 3.
Dipper says: "Thank you all for coming."
Mabel Pines says: "Hey, when there's a mystery, you can count on your sister..."
Mabel Pines says: "-Ey."
Soos Ramirez says: "That's an amazing rhyme."
Soos Ramirez says: "When you want some, good..."
Soos Ramirez says: "When you need a Soos, you..."
Soos Ramirez says: "Oh oh, gosh, I don't know."
Dipper says: "We're here to solve the number one mystery in Gravity Falls; who wrote this journal?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Dipper says: "Thirty years ago the author vanished without a trace."
Dipper says: "But according to this new clue,  We find that author, we learn the answers to everything."
Dipper says: "We just need to figure out a way to get down there."
Wendy says: "Chop it down, dudes!"
Mabel says: "Wendy!"
Dipper says: "Oh, hey!"
Dipper says: "You came."
Wendy says: "Dude, I'm so stoked about this."
Wendy says: "I've been wanting to go adventuring with you guys."
Wendy says: "Sure beats picking up after my dad at home."
Cut to Manly Dan at home.
Manly Dan says: "Ow!"
Manly Dan says: ", Ow!"
Manly Dan says: "Ow!"
Manly Dan says: "Who put that wall there?"
Manly Dan says: "Ow!"
Cut back to the gang.
Wendy says: "Thanks for the invite, man!"
Dipper says: "Of course, anytime you wanna.."
Dipper says: "I, we're always..."
Dipper says: "Us."
Mabel says: "Uh oh!"
Mabel says: "Inviting Wendy on our mission?"
Mabel says: "Me thinks there's romance afoot!"
Dipper says: "No, look I've thought this through and I'm over Wendy."
Dipper says: "I've looked at it from every angle, and that thing was going nowhere."
Dipper says: "I know what matters to me now, and it's finding the author of this journal."
Mabel says: "Hah!"
Mabel says: "YOU'RE over Wendy?!"
Mabel says: "!"
Mabel says: "Allow me to put on my "skepticals."
Mabel says: ""  Whooop!"
Dipper says: "I've moved on, Mabel."
Dipper says: "You should too."
Mabel says: "Skepticals..."
Wendy says: "Hey, is it just me, or does that branch kinda look like a lever?"
Dipper turns his back on the tree. Wendy uses her belt to start climbing up the tree.
Dipper says: "Huh, yeah."
Dipper says: "But how do we get up there..."
Dipper says: "?"
Dipper says: "It seems we'd need like a ladder, or like, ladder shoes..."
Dipper says: "Yeah, ladder shoes."
Dipper says: "I'll get Soos to draw up a prototype."
Wendy says: "Boosh."
Soos says: "Whoa ho-ho!"
Mabel says: "Wow!"
Wendy says: "Oh yeah, my dad used to make me compete in these lumberjack games when I was a kid."
Wendy says: "Guess I kinda ruled at it."
The tree begins shaking. Three crows fly away.
Wendy says: "Whoa, what is that?"
At the bottom, the ground and tree sink down, taking Wendy with it. The others pull her out before she falls in. They stand around it as a staircase to the middle of the tree appears, and subsequently a door inside the tree opens.
Dipper says: "Alright guys, this is it."
Dipper says: "Remember, whatever happens down there, we tell no one."
Dipper says: "Now, who wants to go first?"
Mabel says: "Whoa!"
Soos says: "Whoa!"
Dipper says: "Cool!"
Wendy says: "This is so, stupid cool!"
Dipper says: "It's like a fallout shelter or something."
Dipper says: "It must've belonged to the author."
Wendy says: "This is going over my bed."
Mabel says: "Haha!"
Mabel says: "My face feels fuzzy!"
Dipper says: "This is incredible!"
Dipper says: "It's like he was preparing for a disaster."
Dipper says: "But what kinda disaster would need supplies for over sixty years?"
Dipper says: "Wait guys, I think this can was opened recently."
Soos says: "The author might still be alive, down here!"
Wendy says: "Wait a minute..."
Wendy says: "Whoa!"
Wendy says: "Oh, man!"
Wendy says: "Was this place built in the past or the future?"
Soos says: "This room is way creepy."
Mabel says: "Not as creepy as Dipper's internet history!"
Mabel says: "Heyo!"
Soos says: "What's goin' on, dude?"
Mabel says: "Haha, it's hard to be scared with caterpillars on your face."
Mabel says: "Wall things!"
Mabel says: "Crazy wall things happening right now!"
Wendy says: "It won't stop!"
Mabel says: "Dipper!"
Mabel says: "What do we do?!"
Mabel says: "!"
Dipper says: "Find these four symbols!"
Dipper says: "Quick!"
Dipper says: "Everybody step on one!"
Soos says: "One!"
Wendy says: "Two!"
Mabel says: "Three!"
Dipper says: "Four!"
Mabel says: "Run for it!"
Wendy says: "Yes!"
Wendy says: "Yes!"
Wendy says: "That was, huh, that was nuts!"
Wendy says: "You ruled back there, man!"
Dipper says: "Haha, thanks."
Wendy says: "Get a load of this crazy Surveillance Room."
Soos says: "Check it out dudes!"
Wendy says: "Soos, Soos..."
Wendy says: "That is hilarious."
Mabel says: "Hey."
Mabel says: "Dipper!"
Mabel says: "Look what I found..."
Mabel says: "I know it!"
Mabel says: "I know it!"
Mabel says: "I know it!"
Mabel says: "You're not over Wendy at all!"
Mabel says: "And you were gonna tell her today?"
Dipper says: "No, I changed my mind; it's a bad idea."
Dipper says: "I'd embarrass myself and then I'd be another guy she hates, like Robbie."
Mabel says: "Dipper, you should just tell her already."
Mabel says: "One way or another, you'll feel better afterwards."
Dipper says: "Look, Mabel, I can't tell her no matter how much I want to, so just drop it OK?"
Wendy says: "Dude!"
Wendy says: "Dipper, you gotta check out this weird metal closet."
Wendy says: "I am a robot, I have a metal closet."
Dipper says: "This never happened."
Mabel says: "Brother, whatever happens I just you need to know something: this is for your own good."
Dipper says: "What?"
Dipper says: "What the-?"
Dipper says: "MABEL!"
Dipper says: "Let us out!"
Mabel says: "Oh, I'll let you out Dipper, as soon as you tell Wendy that thing you've been wanting to tell her!"
Mabel says: "You'll thank me for this later!"
Wendy says: "What is she talking about?"
Dipper says: "Nothing!"
Dipper says: "Mabel's just been eating raw sugar packets again."
Mabel says: "Om nom..."
Mabel says: "That's besides the point!"
Dipper says: "Let me out RIGHT NOW!"
Wendy says: "Uh!"
Wendy says: "Where are the lights?"
Dipper says: "AHHH!"
Wendy says: "AHHH!"
Water gushes down, followed by a blast of hot air that pushes them together. A red light flashes and a tone sounds. A sign reading "Decontamination Complete" flashes and doors open on a wrecked underground room.
Dipper says: "Whoa!"
Dipper says: "A hidden lab!"
Dipper says: "Maybe the author did experiments down here."
Wendy says: "Huh."
Wendy says: "What do you think dug all these tunnels?"
Dipper says: "Lets hope we don't find out."
Dipper says: "Mabel, open up, for real!"
Dipper says: "There's a monster in here!"
Mabel says: "Ha ha, nice try!"
Mabel says: "The only monsters are your own inner demons, Dipper!"
Soos says: "That is so wise."
Wendy says: "Dipper, just say whatever Mabel wants you to say, so she'll let us out of here!"
Mabel says: "Come on Dipper!"
Mabel says: "Now's the time, bro!"
Dipper says: "Wendy, I—"
Dipper says: "I—"
Dipper says: "I'm gonna find another way out!"
Wendy says: "Wait, what?"
Wendy says: "Dude, where are we going?"
Wendy says: "What do we do?"
Dipper says: "I don't know!"
Unknown Man says: "Back, back you heinous beast!"
Dipper says: "It's, it's you!"
Unknown Man says: "Hurry now, I scared it off, but it'll regenerate."
Unknown Man says: "I wasn't expecting guests."
Unknown Man says: "I've been down here for a very long time."
Unknown Man says: "Years!"
Unknown Man says: "Weeks, maybe!"
Unknown Man says: "I miss orange juice."
Dipper says: "You don't understand, you're the guy I've been looking for!"
Wendy says: "He's the guy?"
Dipper says: "Wendy, he's the guy!"
Unknown Man says: "The guy?"
Dipper says: "I've got like a gillion questions!"
Dipper says: "Why did you write the journals?"
Dipper says: "Who was after you?"
Dipper says: "Why did you build this bunker?"
Unknown Man says: "Heh."
Unknown Man says: "My boy I'd love to discuss this in time."
Unknown Man says: "We have more pressing matters."
Cut to Mabel and Soos exploring the other room.
Soos says: "Sure are taking their time in there."
Soos says: "Hey, do I look smarter with this coat and brief case?"
Soos says: "I feel like I look smarter..."
Mabel says: "Frozen!"
Mabel says: "Unfrozen!"
Mabel says: "Frozen!"
Mabel says: "Unfrozen!"
Mabel says: "What's this?"
Mabel says: "Experiment number 210: the shape shifter."
Soos says: "The shape shifter?"
Soos says: "Uh, dude?"
Soos says: "Didn't Dipper say there was a monster in there with them?"
Mabel says: "I thought he was just joking!"
Soos says: "YOU KNOW DIPPER'S JOKES ARE TERRIBLE!"
Mabel says: "DIPPER!!"
Cut back to Dipper, Wendy, and the Unknown Man, still in the lab.
Unknown Man says: "Come in, come in!"
Unknown Man says: "I apologize for the state of things!"
Unknown Man says: "I don't get many non mole-people visitors."
Unknown Man says: "Now the beast must have some weakness we can exploit."
Unknown Man says: "I just wish I had my research on me."
Unknown Man says: "But alas, I lost my journals so many years ago."
Wendy says: "Did you say journals?"
Dipper says: "Dude!"
Dipper says: "I found one of them!"
Dipper says: "That's how I tracked you down here."
Unknown Man says: "What?!"
Unknown Man says: "!"
Unknown Man says: "Could it be?"
Oh yes, after all these years...
Cut to Mabel and Soos running in to the other room, both are panting.
Soos says: "Wendy?!"
Soos says: "!"
Soos says: "Oh, it's so dark!"
Soos says: "How will we ever find them?"
Mabel says: "Leave that to Mabel!"
Soos says: "Whoa, rad!"
Soos says: "Although, isn't electric clothing kinda like a fire hazard?"
Mabel says: "No."
Mabel says: "It's a fun hazard."
Mabel says: "Now let me light the way!"
Soos says: "We're coming for you dudes!"
Cut back to Wendy, Dipper, and the Unknown Man, who is skimming through the pages of the journal.
Unknown Man says: "Yes, yes."
Unknown Man says: "It's all here."
Dipper says: "Wendy!"
Dipper says: "Isn't it amazing we're actually meeting the real author?"
Dipper says: "Uhh, you know what?"
Dipper says: "We should probably get going."
Dipper says: "Can I have my journal back?"
Dipper says: "AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!"
Wendy says: "AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!"
Shape Shifter says: "How do you like my true form?"
Shape Shifter says: "Go on, admit it, you like it!"
Dipper says: "You!"
Dipper says: "What did you do to the real author?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Shape Shifter says: "You'll likely never find out."
Shape Shifter says: "That six-fingered nerd hasn't been himself in thirty years!"
Shape Shifter says: "But I thank you for bringing me his journal."
Shape Shifter says: "He used to write it while I was in my cage."
Shape Shifter says: "So many wonderful forms to take!"
Dipper says: "We've gotta get that journal back!"
Wendy says: "Hey body snatcher!"
Wendy says: "Snatch this!"
Dipper says: "RUN!"
Dipper says: "RUN!"
Dipper says: "RUN!"
Dipper says: "Wait!"
Dipper says: "How do we know they're not the shape shifter?"
Soos says: "Maybe I am!"
Soos says: "Mabel, inspect my shape!"
Mabel says: "Poke!"
Soos says: "Do that again!"
Mabel says: "Poke!"
Soos says: "Even better the second time!"
Dipper says: "It's definitely them."
Dipper says: "Oh my gosh, Wendy, you're bleeding!"
Wendy says: "It's cool, it's cool."
Wendy says: "It's just blood man; don't freak out."
Mabel says: "What happened?"
Wendy says: "We got attacked by the shape shifter."
Wendy says: "He broke out of his cage, pretended to be the author, and wants Dipper's journal."
Dipper says: "Imagine if he escapes to the town!"
Dipper says: "He can transform into anything!"
Dipper says: "We could never trust anyone ever again!"
Mabel says: "What do we do?!"
Mabel says: "!"
Wendy says: "Well, he took us into his home, tricked us, and tried to destroy us."
Wendy says: "I say we return the favor."
Cut to a different tunnel. The shape shifter returns to its human form.
Shape Shifter says: "Dipper, my boy!"
Shape Shifter says: "Come out!"
Mabel says: "Oh boy, Dipper."
Mabel says: "That book sure is full of some great monsters!"
Shape Shifter says: "There you are!"
Shape Shifter says: "Ooh, and a new one."
Dipper says: "They scream and run away as the shape shifter chases them."
Mabel says: "They scream and run away as the shape shifter chases them."
Dipper says: "Guys, he's coming!"
Dipper says: "He's coming!"
Dipper says: "NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW!!"
Soos says: "It's not working, dude!"
Dipper says: "HEY, LET GO!"
Wendy says: "You leave him alone!"
Wendy is pulled away with the journal. Dipper is left behind.
Dipper says: "Wendy!"
Wendy jumps on the shape shifter and prepares to attack it with her ax. Soos successfully turns the valve and a strong stream of water bursts from the pipe. Wendy and the shape shifter are knocked back by the water. Dipper, Mabel and Soos get caught in the flow as well. Wendy hits a rock under the water, then the water subsides.
The water drains out.
Wendy says: "Uh, Dipper?"
Dipper says: "Huh—"
Dipper says: "wha—"
Dipper says: "Wendy?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Dipper says: "W-wait, then who's..."
Dipper says: "?"
Dipper says: "LOOK OUT!"
Shape Shifter says: "Give me back that journal!"
Wendy says: "Never!"
Wendy says: "Get off me!"
The two Wendys fight while Dipper watches. It is unclear which is the shape shifter. Dipper picks up the ax and approaches them.
Wendy says: "Give it back; it belongs to Dipper!"
Wendy says: "Hit her with the ax!"
Shape Shifter says: "Don't listen to her, Dipper!"
Wendy says: "She's the shape shifter!"
Dipper says: "Uh, uh, I don't know who's who!"
Dipper says: "Give me a sign!"
The tube that Mabel froze and unfroze earlier flashes "READY." The shape shifter rips the ax out of its body.
Dipper says: "Push him in!"
Dipper and Wendy push the shape shifter into the tube. The door closes and the tube begins freezing the shape shifter. The shot pulls back to show Mabel and Soos watching through a screen. Mabel has pressed the button to activate the tube.
Mabel says: "Frozen!"
Mabel says: "Boop!"
Soos says: "Boosh!"
Shape Shifter says: "No!"
Mabel says: "Soos: Let's get out of here, dudes."
Soos are now in the same room as Wendy says: "Soos: Let's get out of here, dudes."
Dipper says: "Soos: Let's get out of here, dudes."
the shape shifter says: "Soos: Let's get out of here, dudes."
Shape Shifter says: "You think you're so clever don't you, Dipper?"
Shape Shifter says: "But you have no idea what you're up against."
Shape Shifter says: "You will never find the author."
Shape Shifter says: "If you keep digging, you'll meet a fate worse than you can imagine."
Shape Shifter says: "And this will be the last form you ever take!"
Soos says: "Good luck sleeping tonight!"
Cut to outside. The tree returns to it's default position says: "Soos: Dude, I think I'm kind of adventured out for a little while."
Cut to outside. The tree returns to it's default position says: "My face hurts from doing this all day."
Mabel says: "Yeah, but you gotta admit we're all total heroes."
Soos says: "Hey, who wants to get some heroes' breakfast, huh?"
Mabel says: "Syrup on cereal!"
Soos says: "Mabel, you're a visionary!"
Dipper says: "Look, Wendy, about earlier."
Dipper says: "In the heat of the moment, I might have said some dumb things, and can't we pretend none of that ever happened?"
Dipper says: "Please?"
Wendy says: "Dude, dude."
Wendy says: "It's okay."
Wendy says: "I always kinda knew."
Dipper says: "Wait, you did?"
Wendy says: "Yeah man, you think I can't hear that stuff you're constantly whispering under your breath?"
Wendy says: "Listen Dipper, I'm like, super flattered, but..."
Wendy says: "I'm too old for you."
Wendy says: "I mean, you know that, right?"
Dipper says: "Mabel said confessing would make me feel better."
Wendy says: "Well, how do you feel?"
Dipper says: "Anxious."
Dipper says: "Scared."
Dipper says: "Kinda itchy."
Wendy says: "Dude, don't be itchy man."
Wendy says: "Let me tell you something."
Wendy says: "This summer was super boring until you showed up."
Wendy says: "I have more fun with you than practically anybody else."
Wendy says: "And if you ever stopped being my friend,..."
Wendy says: "I would, like, throw myself into the Bottomless Pit!"
Dipper says: "So things won't be too, awkward, now?"
Wendy says: "I just wrestled myself, dude."
Wendy says: "That was awkward."
Wendy says: "If you can handle that monster, you can handle a little awkwardness."
Dipper says: "Friends?"
Wendy says: "Yeah, dude!"
Wendy says: "Friends!"
Both laugh, then Wendy pulls him back onto the log.
Wendy says: "Oh, and hey Dipper?"
Wendy says: "See you for movie night tomorrow."
Wendy says: "Your place this time, okay?"
Mabel says: "Sooo?"
Mabel says: "How did it go?"
Dipper says: "Wha—"
Dipper says: "what did you hear?"
Mabel says: "Everything!"
Mabel says: "All the time!"
Soos says: "I'M NOT HERE!"
Dipper says: "Mabel, how can everything be so amazing and so terrible all at the same time?"
Mabel says: "I'm so sorry for being so pushy Dipper."
Mabel says: "If it's any consolation, I'm already working on your list of potential rebound crushes."
Dipper says: "Thanks Mabel."
Dipper says: "Whoa!"
Soos says: "Whoa!"
Soos says: "What the?"
Dipper says: "Soos, that's not a briefcase, it's a laptop!"
Mabel says: "And a really busted up one too."
Soos says: "I bet I could get this thing fixed up in a few days."
Soos says: "It's gonna take a lotta duct tape."
Dipper says: "This could be our next clue!"
Zooms in on the laptop. A label reads "Property of F" MO52584.
Cut to end credits. Dipper and Wendy are watching a movie on TV.
Dipper says: "Is it just me or does Gravity Falls TV only have the worst movies?"
TV Voice says: "You're watching the Gravity Falls Bargain Movie Showcase."
