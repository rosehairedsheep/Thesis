Dipper says: "Uncle Ford asked me to be his apprentice once the summer was over."
Dipper says: "But that would mean I wouldn't go back home."
Dipper says: "It would mean growing up without Mabel."
Wendy says: "Oh, dude."
Dipper says: "Mabel didn't take it well and she ran off into the forest."
Dipper says: "She couldn't even look me in the eye."
Wendy says: "Come on."
Wendy says: "Let's get some fresh air."

Dipper says: "Bill said it himself, there's no room for heroes out here."
Dipper says: "We lost."
Wendy says: "Look, dude, it's not over yet."
Wendy says: "You've beaten Bill twice before, why is this time any different?"
Dipper says: "'Cause then I had Mabel."
Wendy says: "Then you need to get Mabel back."
Wendy says: "Look, this summer, I've seen some amazing things, but nothing as amazing as you and your sister."
Wendy says: "I don't know if it's dumb luck or yin and yang, or whatever, but when you two work together, there's like nothing you two can't accomplish."
Wendy says: "You just need to make up, and team up, and save the universe."
Dipper says: "But how will I ever find her?"
A monster eats a billboard, revealing a bubble with Mabel's shooting star on it at the cliffs.
Dipper says: "The shooting star from Mabel's sweater!"
Dipper says: "She's in there."
Dipper says: "I know it."
Wendy says: "Whoa, it that like twin ESP?"
Dipper says: "No, we don't have that, but we do have this thing where our allergies totally act up at the same time."
Dipper says: "Mabel needs us."
Dipper says: "But how are we gonna get out there without being caught?"
Wendy says: "I have an idea."

Blendin says: "How dare you!!"
Time Baby says: "Hear this, Cipher!"
Bill says: "Ugh, Time Baby."
Time Baby says: "Surrender now, or face my tantrum!"
Bill says: "Oh, no, a tantrum!"
Bill says: "Whatever will I do about that-HOW 'BOUT THIS??"
Bill says: "BOOM."
Kryptos says: "Ah, snap!"
Kryptos says: "He just killed Time Baby!"
Demons says: "Yeahhh!"
8 Ball says: "Boss, the Pine Tree kid got away before we could eat him."
8 Ball says: "Are you worried he might try to cause some trouble?"

Bill says: "Ha!"
Bill says: "I'm not worried."
Bill says: "I've got someone on the case."

Wendy says: "I wonder if they have a tank."
Wendy says: "I've always wanted to drive a tank!"
Dipper says: "I can't believe this place is just abandoned."
Toby says: "Ooh, an air freshener."
Toby says: "Finally I'll smell like a person."
Toby says: "Stealy stealy..."
A tranquilizer dart hits him.
Toby says: "Ah!"
Several more darts hit him and he collapses.
Wendy says: "Oh no!"
Wendy says: "Tony!"
Wendy says: "Was it Tony?"
Wendy says: "I can never remember his name."

Heheh! Ground walkers! Heheh! Ain't got no wheels!
Wendy says: "Listen Discount Auto Warriors!"
Dipper says: "We just wanna make it to that bubble out east; we have no quarrel with you!"
Gideon says: "Oh, but that's where you're wrong!"
Gideon says: "Hands where I can see 'em."
Gideon says: "Y'all fellers ain't goin' nowhere."
Wendy says: ""Y'all?"
Dipper says: ""Fellers?"
Dipper says: "" Wait..."

Gideon says: "Ma' old pal Bill figured you might try to rescue Mabel."
Gideon says: "So he appointed me, master of these wastelands, and keeper of the bubble!"
Gideon says: "My sweet precious Mabel's trapped inside and I HAVE THE ONLY KEY!"
Gideon says: "Wrapped around my..."
Gideon says: "well I wouldn't call it a neck exactly, wrapped around this little pocket of fat under ma' head?"
Dipper says: "Gideon, you have no right to keep her in there!"
Gideon says: "Bill explained it to me nice and simple: she was always destined to be mine!"
Gideon says: "And now that I have her in a cage she'll learn to love me!"
Gideon says: "I have an eternity to wait!"
Gideon says: "Ghost-Eyes!"
Gideon says: "Ready to escort our friends to Bill's dungeon?"
Dipper says: "Uh!"
Dipper says: "No!"
Dipper says: "Hey!"
Wendy says: "This isn't gonna work, Gideon."
Gideon says: "Oh?"
Gideon says: "And why's that?"
Wendy says: "Cause after I break Ghost-Eyes' arm and steal that key from your neck, I'm gonna wear your butt on my foot like a rhinestone slipper!"
Gideon says: "Oho, and what makes you think you can do all that?"
Wendy says: "'Cause I'm a flippin' CORDUROY!"
Gideon says: "Ghost-Eyes!"
Gideon says: "My hench-angel!"
Wendy says: "Ha!"
Gideon says: "You'll never get away with this, ya hear me?!"
Gideon says: "!"
Wendy says: "Guess what?"
Wendy says: "We already DID!"
Dipper says: "Wendy, you're the coolest person I know."
Wendy says: "I know, dude."
Wendy says: "Tell me about it later."
Gideon says: "After them!"
Ghost-Eyes says: "You want your baby seat?"
Gideon says: "Yes, please."
Gideon says: "We are not letting 'em get Mabel!"
Gideon says: "Discount Auto-mart Warriors, rollout!"
Dipper says: "Okay, all we have to do is outrace Gideon's henchmen, unlock the bubble, save Mabel, save the world."
Dipper says: "Quick question: did you ever get your driver's license?"
Wendy says: "Definitely not."
Wendy says: "Arm!"
Dipper says: "Ah!"
Wendy says: "Ah!"
Prisoner inside car says: "Uhahhhhh!"
Gideon says: "Swerve swerve!"
Gideon says: "I can't let 'em free Mabel!"
Ghost-Eyes says: "Remind me why you're keeping your girlfriend in a prison bubble again?"
Ghost-Eyes says: "Have we, the prisoners, become the wardens?"
Gideon says: "SHE LOVES ME!"
Gideon says: "She just doesn't know it yet."
Gideon says: "Now quit the philosophy."
Ghost-Eyes says: "Sorry."
Ghost-Eyes says: "It was my major."
The cars drive toward some bubbles.
Gideon says: "Ha!"
Gideon says: "Weirdness bubbles blockin' the path!"
Gideon says: "WOOOOWEE we got 'em now."
Dipper says: "Watch it!"
Dipper says: "Go around that bubble field!"
Wendy says: "No way around!"
Wendy says: "Hold on!"
Wendy says: "We're goin' through!"
Dipper says: "What's even in there?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Dipper says: "For some reason, I really want worms right now."
Wendy says: "Eat worms!"
Wendy says: "Fly south!"
Wendy says: "Nest!"
The car exits the bubble and Dipper and Wendy are normal again.
Dipper says: "Oh, that was horrible!"
Wendy says: "Here comes another one, dude!"
Wendy says: "Brace yourself!"
Gideon says: ""AAAAAAAAAUGH!"
Ghost-Eyes says: ""AAAAAAAAAUGH!"
Both the cars are back to normal. Ghost-Eyes slams his truck against Wendy's car, breaking the glass.
Wendy says: "Ah!"
Dipper says: "Wendy, we're almost there!"
Dipper says: "We just have to make that jump!"
Wendy says: "Total lack of driver's training, don't fail me now."
The car hits the ground and rolls. When it stops, the passenger door opens and Dipper falls out.
Dipper says: "So..."
Dipper says: "close."
Soos says: "Heya, Dipper."
Soos says: "How's it hanging?"
Dipper says: "Soos!"
Wendy says: "Soos?"
Soos says: "Handyman of the apocalypse, at your service."
Dipper says: "Soos!"
Dipper says: "How'd you, where'd you-?"
Soos says: "I've been wandering the plains like a desperado, helping strangers."
Soos says: "I guess there's some folk songs about me now?"
Soos says: "Let me see what the damage is, here."
Soos says: "Ah, well the good news is: your arm is okay."
Dipper says: "So what's the bad news?"
Soos says: "Bad news is we're surrounded, dudes."
The prisoners have surrounded them, cheering.
Gideon says: "Wooowee."
Gideon says: "I dare say y'all almost had the jump on me there for a second."
Gideon says: "But this ain't your Gravity Falls anymore!"
Gideon says: "Out here, I win."
Gideon says: "Bill's henchbats will be here any minute to retrieve y'all."
Gideon says: "MABEL'S MINE NOW!"
Gideon says: "Hahahaha!"
Dipper says: "Is she?"
Gideon says: "Well, yeah."
Gideon says: "I have her trapped, ergo, Mabel is MINE!"
Dipper says: "Gideon, listen to me, if I've learned anything this summer it's that you can't force someone to love you."
Dipper says: "The best you can do is strive to be someone worthy of loving."
Gideon says: "Oh, I'm worthy o' lovin'!"
Gideon says: "These prisoners love me!"
Dipper says: "But Mabel doesn't."
Dipper says: "Because you're selfish."
Dipper says: "But you can change!"
Dipper says: "Bill thinks there's no heroes in this world, but if we work together and fight back, we can defeat him."
Dipper says: "You wanna be Mabel's hero?"
Dipper says: "Stand up to Bill, and let us save her!"
Gideon says: "That's crazy!"
Gideon says: "You know what Bill would do to me if that happens?"
Ghost-Eyes says: "What, you scared of Bill?"
Gideon says: "No, I ju..."
Gideon says: "it's a complicated situation."
Dipper says: "Look inside, Gideon."
Dipper says: "If all this is for Mabel, then ask yourself what Mabel would want you to do."
Gideon says: "Dipper."
Gideon says: "Will you tell her what I did?"
Dipper says: "Of course."
Gideon says: "I hope you're right about this."
Gideon says: "Guys, new plan!"
Gideon says: "Bill's minions are gonna be on us in seconds."
Gideon says: "But I'm not gonna let that dumb triangle be the warden o' me!"
Gideon says: "Y'all ready for a good old fashioned prison brawl?"
Ghost-Eyes says: "We're behind you for life, brother!"
Prisoner says: "Fighting children is boring, but fighting a chaos god sounds fun!"
Gideon says: "Lets do this!"
Gideon says: "Henchmen, rollout!"
Soos says: "Whew!"
Soos says: "And I thought I was gonna have to throw down!"

The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity says: "Eh, false alarm."
The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity says: "It's just a bird."
The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity says: "Not one person."
The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity says: "Not one person has..."
