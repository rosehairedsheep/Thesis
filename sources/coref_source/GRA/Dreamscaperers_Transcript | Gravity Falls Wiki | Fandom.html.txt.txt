Stan says: "He's always trying to trick me into losing the Mystery Shack."
Wendy Corduroy says: "One time I caught him stealing my moisturizer."
Soos Ramirez says: "And yet, our mutual hatred for him bonds us together."
Bud says: "Come on down to Li'l Gideon's Tent of Telepathy, opening soon at this location."
Commercial shows the Tent of Telepathy crushing the Mystery Shack.
Dipper says: "Uh, should we be worried about that?"
Stan says: "Please, the only way Gideon's taking over this shack is by breaking in and stealing my deed."
A crash is heard from upstairs.
Wendy says: "You mean like, right now?"
Cuts to Stan's office, where Gideon is attempting to open Stan's safe.
Gideon says: "38?"
Gideon says: "41?"
Gideon says: "Oh, heavens to Betsy!"
Stan says: "Gideon!"
Gideon says: "Well, well, Stanford, my arch-nemesis."
Gideon says: "We seem to have entered a dangerous game of cat and mouse."
Stan says: "Soos, broom."
Gideon says: "Oh no, not the broom!"
Gideon says: "You mark my words, Stanford, one day I'm gonna get that combination."

Soos says: "Dudes, there's a bat in the kitchen!"
Soos says: "It tried to touch me with its "weird little bat fingers!"
Stan says: "Don't worry, I got this under control  Dipper, take care of it."
Mabel says: "Yes!"
Dipper says: "What?"
Dipper says: "Why can't Mabel do it?"
Stan says: "'Cause life ain't fair."
Stan says: "Now go fight a bat so we can watch TV."
Dipper says: "No way, Grunkle Stan!"
Dipper says: "You always make me do dumb chores."
Dipper says: "I'm putting my foot down this time!"
Stan says: "I said do it kid."
Stan says: "Now!"
Old west music plays.
Stan and Dipper have a stare off, growling at each other. Stan wins.
Dipper says: "Okay, I'll do it!"
Dipper says: "Stupid chores..."
Mabel says: "Remember, bats are more afraid of you than you are of them."
Mabel says: "Maybe I'm thinking of ducklings."

Dipper says: "Ow, ow!"
Soos says: "Swabbing on disinfectant, doo doo doo..."
Dipper says: "Why does Grunkle Stan always pick on me?"
Dipper says: "Think about it!"
Dipper says: "The more painful or difficult the chore is, the more likely it is I'll have to do it."
Dipper says: "Why doesn't he pick on you guys?"
Soos says: "Dipper, Stan's personality is one of life's great mysteries."
Soos says: "Like whether or not it's possible to lick your own elbow."
Mabel says: "I bet you can't!"
Soos says: "I bet I can!"
Mabel says: "Lick it!"
Mabel says: "Lick it!"
Mabel says: "Lick it!"
Dipper says: "Sometimes I feel like Stan hates me."
Stan says: "The sink's clogged."
Stan says: "Dipper, get in here and fix it!"
The scene fades into the same picture of Stan, except with a red "X" painted over his eyes and surrounded by candles.
Gideon says: "You think that combination's safe in your mind, Stanford?"
Gideon says: "We'll see what my new minion has to say about that!"
Cuts to Mabel and Soos outside, Soos is still attempting to lick his own elbow, with Mabel still chearing him on.

Gideon says: "W-what are you?"
Gideon says: "H-how do you know my name?"
Bill says: "Oh, I know lots of things!"
Gideon says: "You're insane!"
Bill says: "Sure I am, what's your point?"
Gideon says: "Listen to me, demon!"
Gideon says: "I have a job for you."
Gideon says: "I need you to enter the mind of Stanford Pines and steal the code to his safe."
Bill says: "You know what, kid?"
Bill says: "You've convinced me!"
Bill says: "I'm sold!"
Bill says: "I'll help you with this and in return you can help me with something I've been working on!"
Bill says: "We'll work out the details later."
Gideon says: "Deal!"
Gideon says: "It worked!"
Cut to Dipper sweeping the carpet in the living room while Stan sleeps in his chair.
Stan says: "Oh, I'm so sorry."
Dipper says: "What is going on in that guy's head?"
Mabel and Soos run in.
Mabel says: "Dipper!"
Mabel says: "We've gotta help Stan!"
Dipper says: "Wait, what?"
Soos says: "This evil triangle guy said he's gonna break into Stan's mind and steal the combination to his safe!"
Soos says: "Also we stopped for snacks on the way here."
Dipper says: "Triangle guy?"
Dipper says: ""Beware Bill, the most powerful and dangerous creature I've ever encountered."
Dipper says: "Whatever you do, never let him enter your mind."
Mabel says: "Grunkle Stan!"
Cut to shadow of Bill entering Stan's mind.
Mabel says: "It is possible to follow the demon into a person's mind and prevent his chaos."
Mabel says: "One must simply recite this incantation."
Dipper says: "Ugh, this is just great."
Dipper says: "I spend all day cleaning sinks and fighting bats for Stan and now I have to save him from some crazy brain demon?"
Mabel says: "But if we don't do anything Gideon might steal the shack!"
Mabel says: "Or worse!"
Dipper says: "Fine."
Dipper says: "Get ready, guys."
Dipper says: "We're about to journey into the most horrifying, disturbing place any of us have ever been: our uncle's mind."
Lightning flashes and dramatic music plays.

Soos says: "Thumbs up?"
Soos says: "Thumbs down?"
Soos says: "You know what, I'm just gonna bring 'em."
Cut to commercial break says: "Cut to Dipper, Mabel and Soos around a sleeping Stan in the living room with the lights off and surrounded by a circle of candles: Dipper:  Okay, guys, in order to save our uncle, we're gonna have to follow that..."

As Dipper speaks, his eyes go blue, then Soos', then Mabel's and the candles go out, and after the incantation, there is a blue explosion and the gang is inside Stan's mind. Mabel and Soos make exclamations of awe.
Soos says: "What the?"
Mabel says: "Whoa, this is Stan's mind?"
Soos says: "I figured there would be more hot old ladies."
Mabel says: "Remember everyone, we've got to look out for the triangle guy."
Bill says: "Yeah, look out for the triangle guy!"
Soos says: "It's him!"
Soos says: "It's the guy!"
Mabel says: "You leave our uncle's brain alone, you isosceles monster!"
Mabel says: "Gotcha!"
Mabel says: "Wait, what?"
Bill says: "Ah, Stan's family, we meet at last!"
Bill says: "Question Mark, Shooting Star, Pine Tree, I had a hunch I might bump into you!"
Mabel says: "Boop!"
Dipper says: "Mabel!"
Dipper says: "What do you want with our uncle's mind anyway?"
Bill says: "Oh, just the code to the old man's safe!"
Bill says: "Inside the shack is a maze of a thousand doors representing your uncle's memories."
Bill says: "Behind one of them is a memory of him inputting the code!"
Bill says: "I just need to find it and Gideon will pay me handsomely."
Mabel says: "Not if we stop you!"
Bill says: "Hah, fat chance!"
Bill says: "I'm the master of the mind."
Bill says: "I even know what you're thinking right now!"
Mabel says: "That's impossible, no one can guess what I'm thinking!"
Bill makes Xyler and Craz appear.
Xyler says: "Whoa, where are we, bro?"

Mabel says: "I'm never letting go of your leg!"
Bill says: "You're out of your league, kids."
Bill says: "Turn around now before you see something you might regret."
Bill says: "Later, suckers!"
Dipper says: "We're goin' in!"

Dipper walks a bit, but turns around and runs to the Dipper memories door and enters it.
Dipper says: "Okay."
Dipper says: "Just a quick peek."
Dipper walks by the doors. The sound Stan calling Dipper echoes. Dipper walks in front of one of them and opens the door. Inside is a memory of Stan making Dipper chop firewood.
Stan says: "No buts!"
Stan says: "Now go and chop that firewood already!"
Dipper walks away to chop the firewood. Stan sits on the couch.
Soos says: "Dude, Stan, I've been meaning ask you."
Soos says: "Why are you so hard on Dipper all the time?"
Stan says: "Look, Soos, I'm gonna let you in on something."
Stan says: "Wanna know what I really think?"
Dipper leans to listen what Stan is talking.
Stan says: "The kid's a loser."
Stan says: "He's weak!"
Stan says: "He's an utter embarrassment!"
Stan says: "I just wanna get rid of him."
Dipper closes the door, depressed. Cuts to Bill, disguised as Soos, and Mabel.
Soos says: "Hello?"
Soos says: "Code to Stan's safe?"
Soos says: "Where are you?"
Xyler says: "Opening and closing doors is fun!"
Craz says: "I can do it also!"
Soos opens a door. Inside the door Stan pushes buttons of the vending machine. The vending machine opens and a secret hallway appears.
Soos says: "BORING!"
Cuts to Mabel in front of a door written "Top Secret" on top of it.
Mabel says: "Alright guys, I have a good feeling about this door."
Mabel opens the door. Inside it has a memory of Stan in the bathroom.
Stan says: "Hey, Mr."
Stan says: "Tummy!"
Stan says: "Yes!"
Soos says: "AAH.."
Stan says: "Eat your crackers!"
Stan says: "Yum yum yum yum!"
Mabel says: "Sweet Sally!"
Soos says: "Hah, we've been searching forever!"
Soos says: "What if the triangle guy finds the memory before we do?"
Mabel says: "If we wanna find Stan's memory, we gotta think like Stan."
Mabel says: "He's always hiding stuff, right?"
Soos says: "Yeah!"
Soos says: "Like how he hides his arrest warrants under that rug in the gift shop?"
Mabel says: "Soos, that's it!"
Mabel says: "Look!"
Stan says: "And now to input the code."
Stan says: "13, 44, and finally.."
Soos says: "Dude!"
Soos says: "we found it!"
Mabel says: "Yeah!"
Xyler says: "But what do we do now?"
Craz says: "But what do we do now?"
Xyler says: "Jinx!"
Craz says: "Jinx!"
Mabel says: "Um..."
Mabel says: "um..."
Mabel says: "Let's just destroy the door before Bill can find it!"
Soos says: "Wait!"
Soos says: "Maybe I should do it!"
Soos says: "My big fat arms are great at destroying stuff!"
Mabel says: "Oh, okay."
Soos begins to lifts up the door with some kind of psychic power. As he does this, another Soos walks in.
Soos says: "Hey guys!"
Soos says: "I just saw a memory of Stan roller skating and wearing short-shorts!"
Soos says: "Didn't look..."
Soos says: "didn't look that bad!"
Soos says: "Hey, something weird is goin' on here."
Bill says: "It's funny how dumb you are."
Commercial break.
Bill says: "The combination to Stan's safe."
Bill says: "Boy, that was even easier then I thought!"
Mabel says: "Oh, yeah?"
Mabel says: "Well, you're a-a stink face!"
Xyler says: "Awesome comeback, Mabel!"
Mabel says: "Don't treat me like a child, Xyler."
Bill says: "Later, suckers!"
Mabel says: "Come on!"
Mabel says: "We've gotta save Stan!"
Dipper says: "What's the point?"
Dipper says: "Why should I save him, huh?"
Dipper says: "I work for Stan day and night and all he does in return is say he wants to get rid of me."
Mabel says: "Dipper, I'm sure that's not true."
Dipper says: "I saw it with my own eyes in one of his memories, Mabel!"
Dipper says: "He always picked on me and now I know why."
Dipper says: "Stan hates me!"
Mabel says: "Dipper, it doesn't matter what you saw."
Mabel says: "If we don't stop Bill, we'll lose the Shack!"
Dipper says: "No!"
Dipper says: "You know what?"
Dipper says: "Not this time."
Dipper says: "For once this is one of Stan's problems I'm not gonna fix."
Mabel says: "Fine."
Mabel says: "Come on, Soos."
Mabel says: "We'll save Stan ourselves."
Soos says: "Dipper, you're a cool dude, but..."
Soos says: "this isn't cool, dude."
Craz says: "Let's go, Xyler."
Xyler says: "All right, Craz!"
Craz says: "Those are our names!"
Mabel, Craz, Xyler and Soos leave. Cuts to Bill. Bill opens every door he passes. Then a phone ringing sound is heard. Bill touches his bow tie revealing he had a call from Gideon.
Bill says: "Y'ello?"
Gideon says: "Bill!"
Gideon says: "Did you find the memory with the combination yet?"
Bill says: "Relax, short stack."
Bill says: "I got it right here."
Gideon says: "Ha ha ha!"
Gideon says: "Perfect."
Gideon says: "now give it to me and we'll finish our bargain."
Bill says: "Finally!"
Bill says: "It's--you got a pen there?"
Bill says: "It's 13, 44..."
Bill says: "Ah!"
Bill says: "No no no!"
Bill says: "Wait, no!"
The door falls to the bottomless pit from one of Stan's memories.
Stan says: "..."
Stan says: "and none more bottomless than the bottomless pit!"
Stan says: "Which you can see here is bottomless."
Stan says: "Whooh!"
Stan says: "Whatever that was, it's gone forever!"
The door closes. Behind Bill is Mabel who shot the door with a nyarf gun.
Mabel says: "Ha ha!"
Mabel says: "Boom!"
Xyler says: "Mabel did it!"
Craz says: "Mabel did it!"
Soos says: "The Shack is safe!"
Gideon says: "The deal's off!"
Bill says: "Wa-wait!"
Bill says: "No!"
Bill says: "Wait!"
Gideon says: "I'm switchin' to plan B!"
The screen turns off and Bill's body cracks to pieces and falls off. Then Bill's body reappears as red.
Bill says: "YOU!"
Bill says: "You can't even imagine what you just cost me!"
Bill says: "Do you have any idea what I'm like..."
Bill says: "WHEN I'M MAD???!!"
Bill says: "!!"
Several characters pass by Bill's eye. Then a rock in the shape of Stan's head pops out from their feet and raises up. Bill's size starts increasing.
Soos says: "So I guess he gets really mad when he gets mad."
Bill says: "EAT NIGHTMARES!"
Cut to Dipper walking around, finding a way out.
Dipper says: "Ugh!"
Dipper says: "How do I get out of this place?"
Dipper says: "Aw, this again?"
Stan says: "He's a loser."
Stan says: "He's weak."
Stan says: "I just wanna get rid of him."
Stan says: "Heh, yeah."
Stan says: "Those are all things people said about me when I was a boy."
Dipper says: "Huh?"
Stan says: "It was terrible."
Stan says: "I was the biggest wimp on the playground!"
A door of Stan's memory opens behind Dipper. It shows Stan as a kid getting bullied by other kids and running with tears.
Stan says: "So one summer, my pop signs up me for boxing lessons."
A door of Stan boxing opens. He is getting punched by his opponent.
Stan says: "It was even worse than the school yard!"
Young Stan says: "Left hook!"
Stan says: "Y'know, that time I thought my pop was trying to torture me."
A door of Stan at the theater opens.

Stan says: "The old man was doin' me a favor all along!"
Man says: "Give me that bag!"
Carla says: "Help!"
Carla says: "My purse!"
Carla says: "Help!"
Young Stan says: "Left hook!"
The people all around Stan cheers for him. Carla gives him a kiss.
Stan says: "You see it?"
Stan says: "That why I'm hard on Dipper."
Stan says: "To toughen him up."
Stan says: "So when the world fights, he fights back."
Soos says: "Do you think it's actually working?"
Dipper in the memory.
Chops the wood in a half I-I did it! Ha ha! Yes!
Stan says: "He's really comin' along!"
Stan says: "When push comes to shove, I'm actually proud of him."
Stan says: "Just..."
Stan says: "don't ever tell him that."
Stan says: "His head is big enough as it is."
Soos says: "That's true."
Dipper grins and puts his hand on the memory. Then he accidentally gets into the memory, facing with Stan.
Stan says: "Whoa, kid, what are you doin' here?"
Stan says: "Nice hole in your chest, by the way."
Stan says: "Let's fix that up."
Dipper says: "Wh-what the- How did you do that?"
Stan says: "Word to the wise, kid."
Stan says: "We're in the mind!"
Stan says: "You can do what ever you imagine in here!"
Dipper says: "Well how about that?"
A fighting sound and Soos', Mabel's scream is heard outside from the memory.
Dipper says: "Oh my gosh, what am I doing?"
Dipper says: "I gotta stop Bill!"
Stan says: "Huh, fighting back."
Cut to Bill says: "Bill: One nightmare, coming up!"
Soos says: "Nightmare?"
Soos says: "Hope he doesn't mean that British dog man I'm always dreaming about..."
The British dog man appears in front of Soos.
British dog man says: "'Ello, 'ello, 'ello!"
British dog man says: "Who's crike for a stick in the pudding?"
Soos says: "It's everything I've ever feared!"
Bill says: "You!"
Mabel becomes green and ugly. Her voice also changes low and slow.
Bill says: "You're next!"
Craz says: "Cool!"
Craz says: "We're next!"
Craz dances with Xyler but they both get knocked out by Bill's beam. They burn and vanish.
Mabel says: "My dream boys!"
Bill says: "And now to finish you all once in for all!"
Mabel says: "No, no!"
Soos says: "No, no!"
Dipper says: "Hey!"
Dipper says: "Bill!"
Bill says: "WHAT?!"
Bill says: "!"
Dipper says: "Nice bow tie!"
Mabel says: "Dipper!"
Soos says: "Dude!"
Dipper says: "Guys!"
Dipper says: "I just learned that you can conjure whatever you can conceive in Grunkle Stan's mindscape!"
Mabel says: "Huh?"
Dipper says: "Just think of cool fighting stuff and it will happen."
Dipper says: "Like this!"
Soos says: "Ha ha, he's dead now."
Bill says: "What?"
Bill says: "Who told you that!"
Bill says: "Don't listen to him!"
Mabel says: "We can do anything?"
Mabel says: "Po-pow!"
Mabel says: "P-p-pow!"
Mabel says: "Pow!"
The kitten fists stick on Bill.
Mabel says: "Well hello, friends!"
Soos says: "Anything, huh?"
Soos says: "Soos love stomach beam stare!"
Mabel says: "Hamster ball shields activate!"
Soos says: "Activate!"
Dipper says: "Activate!"
The laser gets reflected by the hamster ball and hits Bill in the eye.
Bill says: "AH!"
Bill says: "Oh my eye!"
Bill says: "AAH!"
Mabel, Dipper and Soos' hamster ball breaks.
Mabel says: "Rise, Xyler!"
Mabel says: "Rise, Craz!"
Xyler and Craz rise from behind her back with musical instruments. They start to play synthesized music.
Bill says: "No!"
Bill says: "Synthesized music!"
Bill says: "It hurts!"
Dipper says: "And now to imagine your worst nightmare!"
Dipper says: "A portal out of Stan's mind!"
Mabel says: "Out of Stan's mi-ind!"
Dipper says: "Mabel!"
Dipper says: "Everyone, together!"
The gang all starts to imagine. A hole below Bill appears.
Bill says: "No, no, no!"
Bill says: "ENOUGH!!"
Bill says: "You know, I'm  impressed with you guys."
Bill says: "You're a lot more clever than you look."
Bill says: "Especially the fat one."
Soos says: "He's talking about you!"
Bill says: "So I'm gonna let you kids off the hook."
Bill says: "You might come in handy later."
Bill says: "BUT KNOW THIS: A darkness approaches."
Bill says: "A day will come in the future when everything you care about will change!"
Bill says: "Until then I'll be watching you!"
Bill says: "I'LL BE WATCHING YOU..."
Dipper says: "He's gone!"
Dipper says: "we did it!"
Dipper says: "Stan must be waking up."
Mabel says: "Will I ever see you guys again?"
Craz says: "In your dreams."
Xyler says: "Good one, bro."
Xyler says: "Good one."
The gang wakes up in the living room, shouting in surprise.
Mabel says: "We did it!"
Stan says: "What?"
Stan says: "Did what?"
Stan says: "What are you all doing here?"
Stan says: "And why was I dreaming of two brightly colored and radical young men?"
Dipper says: "Grunkle Stan!"
Dipper says: "You're okay!"
Stan says: "What is this, a hug?"
Dipper says: "Nope!"
Dipper says: "It's a choke hold."
Mabel and Soos laughs. Dipper stops choking Stan.
Stan says: "Not bad, kid."
Stan says: "Not bad."
Mabel says: "I'm just glad Gideon didn't get into the safe."
Mabel says: "I really love this old shack."
Soos says: "Group hug!"
Soos says: "No?"
Soos says: "I never know the right time!"
The Shack starts to shake.
Dipper says: "Hey, do you guys feel..."
Dipper says: "?"
An explosion happens behind the sofa.
Gideon says: "Oh, I'm sorry, Pines family."
Gideon says: "Did I wake you?"
Dipper says: "But.."
Dipper says: "we defeated Bill!"
Gideon says: "Bill failed me!"
Gideon says: "So I switched to plan B: dynamite!"
Stan says: "What?"
Stan says: "Bill?"
Stan says: "Who?"
Stan says: "What are you guys talking about?"
Gideon says: "Spoiler alert, Stanford!"
