Mabel says: "Hey!"
Mabel says: "Watch it!"
Dipper and Mabel continue jabbing each other for a few seconds until Mabel's Meow o'clock clock starts ringing.
Mabel says: "Hey, Dipper, I gotta go hang out with Candy and Grenda tonight."
Dipper says: "Aw, again?"

Grenda says: "Beautiful!"
Grenda says: "Beautiful!"
Dipper says: "Arrrrgh!"
Dipper says: "Mabel!"
Dipper says: "Do you think you can do this somewhere else?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Dipper says: "You're laughing at frequencies only dogs should hear!"
Mabel says: "Come on, it's not that bad."
Grenda says: "You know what your brother needs?"
Mabel says: "A makeover?"
Dipper is seen walking in the hallway with his blanket and pillow. He walks up to Soos, who is screwing something in.
Dipper says: "Hey, Soos, can I sleep in your break room tonight?"
Soos Ramirez says: "Of course, dude."
Soos opens the door to reveal a very cramped room with hazardous pipes and steam.
Soos says: "You just gotta make your body go like a video game puzzle block."
Soos says: "Beebity boop boop beep beepity boop bop boop boop."
Soos says: "Ow, wait wait."
Dipper says: "I think I'll sleep somewhere else..."
Dipper walks away while Soos continues doing the same thing over and over again, Soos said "Oh, actually felt good that time". Cuts to Dipper outside on the ground.

Mabel says: "Ugh..."
Mabel says: "what happened last night?"
Mabel says: "Whoa!"
Candy says: "What's up, party girl?"
Grenda says: "I don't know what I was kissing in there, but I have no regrets!"
Candy says: "Candy falls down now."
Mabel says: "That was awesome, girls."
Mabel says: "See you again soon!"
Candy and Grenda walk out of the room and Dipper enters with a black eye and twigs in his hair and lays on his bed.
Mabel says: "Hey, brother!"
Mabel says: "Want any of this leftover pizza?"
Mabel says: "It's got glitter on it!"

Dipper says: "First of all, no sleepovers."
Mabel says: "What?!"
Mabel says: "!"
Mabel says: "Well if I can't have sleepovers, then you can't keep me up every night with your summer reading."
Dipper says: "How does reading keep you up?"
Flashbacks to a night an unknown time ago.
Mabel says: "Grr..."
Mabel says: "!"
Cuts back to the present day says: "Dipper: Well, at least my braces don't whistle when I breathe."
Mabel says: "At least I wash my clothes once in a while."
Dipper says: "Washing clothes is a waste of time, I'm a busy guy!"
Mabel says: "Meow meow meow meow meow!"
Dipper says: "Alright if you meow one more time—"
Mabel says: "Meow meow meow!"
Dipper says: "Okay, that's it!"
Dipper says: "That's the final straw!"
Dipper says: "Maybe we shouldn't share a room anymore."
Mabel says: "Wah..."
Mabel says: "uh..."
Mabel says: "well maybe we shouldn't!"
Dipper says: "Fine by me!"
Mabel says: "Double fine by me!"
Dipper says: "Then we need to talk to Grunkle Stan about moving rooms."
Mabel says: "Yeah."
Mabel says: "He's a reasonable guy."
Cuts to Stan watching a show with two guys pushing each other.
Stan says: "Fight, fight, fight!"

Stan says: "V."
Stan says: "It knows what I want."
Dipper says: "Grunkle Stan, we want different rooms."
Stan says: "Ha!"
Stan says: "And I want a pair of magic money pants."
Stan says: "It's not gonna happen."
Mabel says: "Magic money pants..."
Mabel says: "?"
Dipper says: "Come on, Grunkle Stan."
Dipper says: "Can't we work something out?"
Stan says: "Look kid, there's my room and the attic."
Stan says: "That's it."
Stan says: "What do you think, there's some kinda "secret hidden room" in the Shack?"
A very loud crash is heard.
Soos says: "Dudes!"
Soos says: "I found some kind of secret hidden room in the Shack!"
Dipper and Mabel grin at each other. Cuts to all of them looking at Soos with a door.
Soos says: "Okay, so I was cleaning up behind this bookcase when boom!"
Soos says: "Mystery door!"
Soos says: "This old Shack is full of weird secrets."
Dipper says: "Whoa-hoh!"
Mabel says: "Classy..."
Dipper says: "Experiment 78?"
Dipper says: "Grunkle Stan, what is this place?"
Stan says: "I don't know."
Stan says: "Just another room I gotta clean up now."
Mabel says: "This carpet is amazing!"
Stan says: "Yeah, if you're into things that are terrible."
Dipper says: "Problem solved, I'll move in here!"
Mabel says: "What?"
Mabel says: "Why do you automatically get the room?"
Mabel says: "We both saw it at the same time."
Stan says: "Wait a second."
Stan says: "Uh oh."
Stan says: "Looks like my shoe's untied."
Dipper and Mabel look at each other for a second before attacking each other trying to tie Stan's shoe.
Stan says: "Muah ha ha."
Stan says: "To the kitchen!"
Stan says: "Fight, fight, fight!"
Stan runs to the kitchen and Dipper and Mabel let go of his shoe. They get up to follow him out the exit, but Soos blocks the door.
Soos says: "Whoa!"
Soos says: "I don't know dudes, this room gives me major, creep-o vibes."
Soos says: "Y'know, the attic is a pretty good space."
Soos says: "Maybe you two should appreciate what you got."
Dipper and Mabel look at each other before running past Soos.
Soos says: "Heh."
Soos says: "Hey, what do I know?"
Soos says: "Maybe there's nothing creepy going on in this room."
The camera then shows the carpet's tag that says "Experiment 78," and the tag is crackling with electricity. Cuts to commercial break.
Dipper and Mabel are in the kitchen, elbowing each other.
Stan says: "Okay, here's how it's gonna go down."
Stan says: "Whoever sucks-up the hardest get's the key to the new room."
Dipper says: "Grunkle Stan, we're not gonna suck-up to you just to get the new room."
Mabel says: "Yeah we are!"
Stan says: "Ten suck-up points for Mabel!"
Dipper says: "I mean—"
Dipper says: "uh—"
Dipper says: "yeah we are!"
Stan says: "Trying too hard."
Stan says: "Minus 15 suck-up points."
Dipper says: "What?"
Mabel says: "Good decision Grunkle Stan!"
Stan says: "Trying way too hard!"
Stan says: "Plus 50 suck-up points!"
Stan says: "Now, who wants to re-tile the roof in searing 105 degree heat?"
Dipper says: "Me me!"
Mabel says: "Me me!"
Dipper says: "I'll do it!"
Mabel says: "I'll do it!"
Mabel says: "No, Dipper, give it here!"
Stan says: "He he."

Mabel says: "I just made Stan an omelet shaped like his own face."
Cuts to Stan looking at his omelet.
Stan says: "I have seen the face of beauty..."
Mabel says: "Face it."
Mabel says: "I'm like a suck-up ninja."
Mabel says: "This room's as good as mine."
Mabel says: "You might as well give up now."
Mabel says: "What do you say?"
Dipper says: "I say I'm gonna win this room somehow, and when I do I'll finally have my own space..."
Dipper says: "..."
Dipper says: "and we'll never have to share anything ever again!"
Dipper slaps Mabel's hand away, electrocuting Mabel, and causing a huge glow in between them.
Both says: "Aaaaah!"
Dipper says: "Ugh..."
Dipper says: "what happened?"
Mabel says: "Dipper?"
Mabel says: "Why are you wearing my clothes..."

Cuts to Dipper and Mabel looking at their new, swapped bodies in the mirror.
Dipper says: "Great!"
Dipper says: "Just what we need, more Gravity Falls weirdness."
Mabel says: "This is stupid!"
Mabel says: "Sharing a room was bad enough, now we're sharing bodies?"
Dipper says: "Ugh, braces are horrible."
Dipper says: "It's like my mouth hates me."
Dipper says: "And what are these things?"
Mabel says: "I don't know why you're so sweaty, and awkward."
Dipper says: "Hey look."
Dipper says: "Experiment 78."
Dipper says: "It was the static electricity!"
Dipper says: "Maybe we can use it to switch back!"
Mabel says: "Phew, ho ho!"
Mabel says: "Glad I'm switching back."
Mabel says: "If I was you I would totally lose the contest."
Dipper says: "And if I was you, which I am, I could sabotage myself!"
Dipper says: "Then Mabel would lose all her points and the room would go to Dipper!"
Mabel says: "Wait, what?"
Dipper says: "Oh Stan!"
Dipper says: "I've always hated you!"
Dipper says: "Ha ha, see who he gives the room to now!"
Mabel says: "No!"
Mabel says: "Wait!"
Mabel says: "Tie your shoes!"
Stan says: "Mm!"
Stan says: "Those cannibals are onto something."
Stan says: "I taste delicious!"

Stan says: "What's the word, Mabel?"
Dipper says: "That's right."
Stan says: "Candy rocks?"
