Stan says: "Summerween!"
Stan says: "The people of this town love Halloween so much, they celebrate it twice a year."
Stan says: "And wouldn't you know it, it's today!"
Dipper says: "Do you always carry that calendar in your pocket?"
Stan says: "Yes."
Mabel Pines says: "Summerween?"
Mabel Pines says: "Something about this feels unnatural."
Soos Ramirez says: "There's free candy!"
Cut to inside the store.

Mabel says: "TO THE COSTUME AISLE!"
Skull says: "I'd lend you a hand..."
Skull says: "but I don't seem to have any!"
Soos says: "Haha, this guy tells it like it is."
Worker says: "Sir, could you please stop pushing that?"
Soos says: "Ma'am, make these heads less hilarious, and you got yourself a deal."
Store worker says: "Ugh..."
Stan says: "Boo."
The baby cries as Stan laughs. Soos continues pressing the skulls and Dipper and Mabel knock over a pile of jack o' melons.
Stan says: "Uh-oh."
Stan says: "Think this one's leaking!"
Store worker says: "Have the police come and eject the Pines family from the store."
Stan says: "NOT TODAY!"
Store worker says: "MY EYES!"
Mabel says: "You paid for the stuff, right?"
Stan says: "Of course!"
Cuts to store worker holding a Stan Buck.

Cuts to theme song. The Mystery Shack is all decorated for Summerween.
Mabel says: "I'm so excited!"
Dipper says: "We're gonna have the best costumes, get the most candy..."
Mabel says: "And have the biggest stomachaches ever!"
Dipper says: "Yeah!"
Mabel says: "Haha, yeah!"
Soos says: "Dude, I've never seen you guys so pumped."
Mabel says: "Well, back at home, me and Dipper were kind of the kings of trick-or-treating."
Mabel says: "Twins in costumes, the people eat it up."
Soos says: "Well, you dudes better be careful out there."
Soos says: "It's a night of ghouls and goblins."
Soos says: "Not to mention..."
Mabel says: "The Summer-what-what?"
Soos says: "The Trickster goes door to door, so the legend goes, eating children who lack the Summerween spirit."
Dipper says: "Well, you don't have to worry about us."
Dipper says: "Sand Pop?"
Dipper says: "Gummy chairs?"
Dipper says: "Mr."
Dipper says: "Adequate-Bar?"
Mabel says: "This is all cheap-o loser candy!"
Soos says: "Quiet your discontent, children, lest the Trickster overhear."
Dipper says: "Your cape is caught in your fly, Soos."
Soos says: "Touche..."
Dipper says: "Goodbye loser candy!"

Dipper says: "Wha-what's up, guys?"
Wendy says: "I left my jacket here."
Wendy says: "Again."
Robbie says: "What's with the candy?"
Robbie says: "You're goin' trick-or-treating or something?"
Dipper says: "Well actually I, uh—"
Wendy says: "Shut up, Robbie, of course he's not going trick-or-treating."
Dipper says: "No!"
Dipper says: "Uh, yeah."
Dipper says: "I guess."
Wendy says: "You should come to this party with us."
Wendy says: "Tambry's parents are out of town, and it's gonna be OFF THE CHAIN."
Robbie says: "Not surprised you didn't hear about it."
Dipper says: "Hey guys, wait!"
Dipper says: "Maybe I'll see you at the party."
Robbie says: "If you're not too busy playing dress up."
Dipper says: "How am I gonna tell Mabel?"
Wolf howls in the distance. Mabel is in the lobby, dressed as strawberry jelly. Candy and Grenda are also here, dressed as a taffy and witch, respectively.
Mabel says: "Grunkle Stan, these are my best friends, Candy and Grenda."
Candy Chiu says: "I am so sweet I could eat myself."
Grenda says: "Hello, Mr."
Grenda says: "Pines!"
Stan says: "You got a cold, honey?"
Stan says: "Something wrong with your voice there?"
Grenda says: "What do you mean?"
Grenda says: "Why would you say that?"
Candy says: "Is Waddles coming with us?"
Mabel says: "I wish he could, but he has some very important meetings to attend!"
Mabel says: "File these documents under 'I', for "I have a curly tail!"
Grenda says: "What about your brother?"
Mabel says: "Oh man guys, just wait until you see Dipper's costume!"
Mabel says: "It's amazing!"
Mabel says: "Here he comes now!"
Candy says: "That is a very good Dipper costume."
Mabel says: "What the hey-hey bro-bro, where's your costume?"
Dipper says: "Look, I can't go trick-or-treating."
Dipper says: "I'm..."
Dipper says: "uh, really sick."
Dipper says: "Go on without me."
Mabel says: "Fight through it, man!"
Mabel says: "Where's your Summerween spirit?"
Someone knocks on the door. Dipper opens it.
Trickster says: "Trick-or-treat."
Dipper says: "Dude, really?"
Dipper says: "You're a little old for this, man."
Dipper says: "Sorry."
Trickster says: "But wait, I—"
Mabel says: "Why'd you close the door?"
Dipper says: "I told you, Mabel, I'm just not feeling it tonight."
Mabel says: "I think a little trick-or-treating will make you feel better."
Dipper says: "I'm not trick-or-treating!"
Knocking on door again.
Mabel says: "Dipper!"
Mabel says: "Where's your Summerween hospitality?"
Knocking on door.
Dipper says: "I'm not getting that."
Mabel says: "Well I am!"
Mabel says: "I apologize for my brother, he came down with a case of the grumpy-grumps."
Trickster says: "SILENCE!"
Trickster says: "You have insulted me!"
Trickster says: "For this you must pay..."
Trickster says: "with your LIVES."
Mabel says: "Aww, what a cute little mask!"

Trickster says: "Funny, am I?"
Gorney says: "Twik-owr-tweet!"
Gorney says: "My name is Gorney."
Gorney says: "Remember meeee!"
Grenda says: "Gorney!"
Trickster says: "There's only one way for you to avoid his fate."
Trickster says: "I will let you live."
Dipper says: "Five hundred treats in one night?"
Dipper says: "That's impossible!"
Trickster says: "The choice is yours, children."
Trickster says: "You must trick-or-treat..."
Trickster says: "Or DIE."
Trickster says: "Bwahahaha."
Dipper says: "Oh my gosh Mabel, do you realize what this means?"
Mabel says: "I do."
Mabel says: "It means you have to come trick-or-treating!"
Mabel says: "Yay!"
Candy says: "Who was that guy?"
Mabel says: "It's the legend Soos told us about."
Mabel says: "It's true!"
Grenda says: "What do we do what do we DO!"
Soos says: "What's goin' on out here, dudes?"
Soos says: "I heard a ruckus."
Soos says: "Hehe."
Soos says: "That's a funny word."
Soos says: "Ruckus."
Dipper says: "Soos, a monster is making us trick-or-treat or else he's gonna eat us!"
Candy says: "I got a picture!"
Candy says: "(Shows Soos a picture she took on her phone; the picture has a pink and fluffy outline, stickers, and a Korean word"
Candy says: "."
Soos says: "The Summerween Trickster!"
Soos says: "Oh man, dude, you guys are in crazy bonkers trouble."
Dipper says: "How are we gonna get that much candy in one night?"
Dipper says: "There's no way!"
Mabel says: "Listen up, people."
Mabel says: "Now some might say that being cursed by a blood-thirsty holiday monster is a bad thing."
Grenda says: "I wet myself."
Mabel says: "But that monster messed with the wrong crew."
Mabel says: "With Candy's spirit, Grenda's strength, Dipper's brains, and..."
Mabel says: "Soos here, we'll get 500 pieces of candy and have fun doing it too, even if it takes all night!"
Mabel says: "To the streets!"
Dipper says: "All night?"
Dipper says: "But-but I'm sick, remember?"
Mabel says: "Dipper, what's worse: getting eaten by a horrifying monster, or coming trick-or-treating with us?"
Dipper says: "Well.."
Mabel says: "Come on!"
Kids says: "Trick-or-treat."
Soldier Kid says: "Can we have candy now?"
Stan says: "What's the matter with you kids?"
Stan says: "That was the scariest thing you've ever seen, right?"
Kids look at each other and motion a "so-so" with their hands.
Stan says: "Well have you seen this!"
Stan says: "Ah!"
Stan says: "Guts!"
Stan says: "Real, very real guts!"
Mummy Kid says: "Uh, we've been watching horror movies since we were like, two years old."

Stan says: "Oh, you will be."
Stan says: "You will be."

Sheriff Blubs says: "You make a great me."
Deputy Durland says: "No, you make a great me."
Blubs says: "No you do."
Dipper says: "I don't understand why we can't just buy our candy and be done with it."
Mabel says: "That sorta takes the fun out of trick-or-treat-or-die."
Dipper says: "I'm trying to take the DIE out of trick-or-treat-or-die."
Trick-or-treaters rings door bell. Lazy Susan answers it.

Mabel says: "You gotta put on your costume."
Dipper says: "I told you, I'm not up to it, Mabel!"
Trickster says: "Oh, really?"
Mabel says: "So what was that about being too sick to wear a costume?"
Dipper sighs and kicks a rock. Cut to the Mystery Shack.

Grenda says: "Not me!"
Grenda says: "Nooo!"
Dipper says: "The perfect time to go to Wendy's party, and no one needs to know I was trick-or-treating."
Robbie's van pulls up. Dipper panics and quickly takes his costume off and hides it and the wheelbarrow full of candy in the bushes.
Wendy says: "Hey Dipper!"
Dipper says: "Oh hey, Wendy."
Dipper says: "What's up?"
Wendy says: "Are you comin' to the party?"
Robbie says: "What are you doing out here?"
Dipper says: "Oh, um."

Wendy says: "Ok, then."
Wendy says: "You're coming, right?"
Dipper says: "Definitely, definitely."
Wendy says: "Cool."
Wendy says: "See you there."
Dipper says: "Later, guys."

Mabel says: "That's why you were acting so weird and trying to hurry us!"
Mabel says: "You're not sick at all!"
Mabel says: "So if it wasn't for this crazy monster, you were gonna ditch me!"
Mabel says: "On our favorite holiday!"
Candy says: "Ooohh."
Grenda says: "Ooohh."
Mabel says: "What happened to the Dipper who used to love Halloween?!"
Mabel says: "!"
Mabel says: "And where's all the candy?!"
Mabel says: "!"
Dipper says: "Relax, relax."
Dipper says: "I left it right here."
Dipper says: "Behind this bush."
Dipper says: "Oh no."
The wheelbarrow full of candy has fallen into a creek gorge and most of the candy is floating downstream.
Mabel says: "What did you do!"
Mabel says: "?"
Dipper says: "Well, I-pch I-!"
Grenda says: "Uh, guys?"
Mabel says: "Oh no!"
Mabel says: "All the jack-o-melons are out!"

Grenda drops the jack-o-melon, commercial break.
Trickster says: "So children."
Trickster says: "Where's my candy?"
Dipper says: "I swear, we had all 500 pieces."
Dipper says: "Look, it's down there somewhere."
Dipper says: "We can still get it."
Trickster says: "I'm afraid it's too late!"
Trickster says: "That was your last chance."
Dipper says: "Go, go, go, go!"
Group runs around Trickster, who follows them. Candy screams as it grabs her. Mabel trips and is grabbed by the Trickster.
Mabel says: "Ahhh!!"
Mabel says: "Dipper!!!"
Dipper says: "Mabel!"
Grenda says: "We're alive!"
Grenda says: "Yeah!"
Soos says: "Woah."
Dipper says: "Soos!"
Mabel says: "Soos!"
Soos says: "That wasn't like, a regular pedestrian, was it?"
Mabel says: "It was the monster!"
Dipper says: "Thanks, Soos."
Dipper says: "Phew."
Dipper says: "I'm just glad it's over, right?"
Soos says: "Did everyone remember to put on their seatbelts?"
Everyone except Mabel says: "Yes."
Soos says: "Let's go!"
Dipper says: "Hey, are you okay?"
Dipper says: "There's probably some bandages back at the Shack."
Dipper says: "We have to hide!"
Dipper says: "It's blocking the only exit."
Dipper says: "Everyone, stay quiet!"
Mabel says: "Oh, so now you're worried about the monster."
Mabel says: "I thought all you cared about was Wendy."
Dipper says: "Mabel, you know that's not true."
Dipper says: "I just felt like I was getting a little to old to go trick-or-treating."
Mabel says: "That's exactly why we need to go trick-or-treating, Dipper!"
Mabel says: "We're getting older, there's not that many Halloweens left!"
Mabel says: "I guess I didn't realize it was already our last one."
Candy says: "We have to escape."
Grenda says: "What if it sees us?"
Soos says: "If only there was something we could use to cover our bodies and faces with."
Soos says: "You know, like a disguise of some kind."
Dipper and Mabel look at each other. Cut to the shelves where the group is hiding from the trickster in costumes. They are heading towards the exit.
Dipper says: "This way!"
Dipper says: "Almost there!"
Dipper says: "Soos!"
Dipper says: "Stop!"
Mabel says: "Soos, don't you dare!"
Soos says: "Sorry dude, today's been way too stressful."
Soos says: "I need some levity."
Mabel says: "Oh thank goodness."
Mabel says: "It was out of batteries."
Mabel says: "Soos, no!"
Skull says: "No matter the score, I'm always a-head!"
Skull says: "Nyaha nyaha."
Soos says: "Hahaha!"
Dipper says: "Hey monster!"
Grenda says: "Salt water taffy?"
Grenda says: "Gross!"
Dipper says: "Wait, it is."
Trickster says: "You really haven't figured it out yet?"
Mabel says: "Loser candy!"
Trickster says: "That's right!"
Trickster says: "Did you ever stop and think about the candy at the bottom of the bag that no one likes?"
Trickster says: "Every year the children of Gravity Falls throw away all of the 'REJECTED' candy into the dump."
Trickster says: "So I seek revenge; revenge on the picky children who cast me aside."
Trickster says: "I'm made of every tossed piece of black licorice, every discarded bar of old chocolate with like that white, powder stuff on it."
Trickster says: "You know that stuff!"
Mabel says: "I hate that stuff!"
Trickster says: "No one would eat me."
Trickster says: "But now, I'm going to eat you."
Soos says: "'Sup, bro?"
Trickster falls to the ground vomiting jelly beans.
Soos says: "Dudes, you want some of this?"
Trickster says: "Wait, you actually think I taste good?"
Soos says: "Uh, sure!"
Soos says: "You know."
Trickster says: "All I've ever wanted is for someone to say that I was..."
Trickster says: "good."
Trickster says: "I'm so happy!"
Soos says: "Crying makes it a little weird, but,  guess I'm still eating."
Soos says: "'Sup, Gorny?"
Gorny says: "I've been twaumatized!"
Cut to the Mystery Shack.
Mummy kid says: "Now what?"
Soldier kid says: "Let's just get our candy already!"
Stan says: "Wash off the shame, Stan."
Stan says: "Wash off the shame."
Soldier kid says: "Ha!"
Soldier kid says: "He thought he could scare us."
The kids watch Stan pulling off the towel.
Stan says: "Eh?"
Stan says: "What's that?"
Kids says: "AAAAAAAA!"
Stan says: "Ahahaha!"
Stan says: "Still got it!"
Dipper says: "Hey, Stan!"
Mabel says: "Hi, Grunkle Stan!"
Soos says: "Hello, Mr."
Candy says: "Hello, Mr."
Grenda says: "Hello, Mr."
Soos says: "Pines!"
Candy says: "Pines!"
Grenda says: "Pines!"
Stan says: "How's it hangin'."
Wendy says: "Hey Dipper."
Dipper says: "Wendy!"
Wendy says: "I didn't see you at the party."
Wendy says: "Where were you?"
Dipper says: "Uh.."
Dipper says: "I-uh.."
Dipper says: "I was trick-o-treating."
Dipper says: "With my sister."
Mabel says: "Yeah."
Wendy says: "The party was lame anyway."
Wendy says: "Robbie ate a lollipop stick-first and had to go home sick."
Mabel says: "Aw, man."
Mabel says: "We went to every single house, and we didn't even get to eat any candy!"
Stan says: "Candy?"
Stan says: "How's that for candy?"
Dipper and Mabel grin at each other. Cut to the TV.
Announcer says: "And now back to the fear guide from Terror Town Street."
Alien says: "NYNG NYNG NYNG."
Everyone is watching TV, eating the candies. Dipper comes to Mabel and attaches a bandage on Mabel's sore arm. Waddles munches the candy in his bowl.
Stan says: "You know, kids?"
Stan says: "I've been thinkin'."
Stan says: "At the end of the day, Summerween isn't about candy or costumes."
Stan says: "Or even scaring people."
Stan says: "It's a day when the whole family can get together at one place and celebrate what really matters: PURE EVIL!"
Stan says: "HAHAHAHAHA!"
Everyone laughs maniacally and then stops abruptly. There is a pause.
Soos says: "I ate a man alive tonight."
Everyone stares at Soos.
Ending credit. Mabel, Grenda and Candy are taking pictures of Waddles with his business man outfit. Then the song "9 to 5" plays, as the screen shows some meme styled pictures of Waddles. Ends with the cracking skull's voice.
