Episode opens with a shot of the Gravity Falls Library.
Dipper Pines says: "Alright, Mabel, today is the big day."
Mabel Pines says: "Big day!"
Dipper says: "Soos finally fixed up the laptop."
Dipper says: "If this thing works, we could learn the identity of The Author and unravel the greatest mysteries of Gravity Falls."
Dipper says: "You ready?"
Mabel says: "Oh, I'm ready, baby."
Mabel says: "Ma-ma."
Dipper says: "This is it."
Dipper says: "This is it."
Dipper says: "Aha!"
Dipper says: "It worked."
Dipper says: "Blip, blap, bloobity bloop, twins."
Mabel says: "Blip, blap, bloobity bloop, twins."
Alarm sounds. The laptop reads "//UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS FORBIDDEN//", and then it reads "Enter Password".
Dipper says: "Ugh!"
Dipper says: "Of course, a password."
Mabel says: "Don't you worry, bro bro."
Mabel says: "With your brains and my laser focus, there is literally nothing that can distract us from..."
Mabel says: "Did you hear that?"
Gabe Bensen says: ": All my life I've been dreamin' of a love that's right for me."
Gabe Bensen says: "And now I finally know her name and it's..."
(talking to the kids says: ") sing it with me kids"
(talking to the kids says: "."
(singing with kids says: ") Literacy"
(singing with kids says: "!"
(Bee puppet says: ") I finally understand what all the buzz is about"
(Bee puppet says: "."
(Bee puppet says: "Reading!"
(Book puppet says: ") Give me some of that honey"
(Book puppet says: "!"
Mabel says: "Ba bump."
Mabel says: "Ba bump."
Dipper says: "Oh, boy."
Theme song says: "Gabe: Haha."
Theme song says: "Thank you, thank you."
Mabel says: "Just when I was getting over Mermando, of course, you show up at my doorstep."
Dipper says: "Okay, this cryptology book says that there's 7."
Dipper says: "2 million 8-letter words."
Dipper says: "I'll type, you read."
Dipper says: "Okay, Mabel?"
Dipper says: "Mabel?"
Mabel's empty chair spins.
(Gabe to puppets says: ") Hey, good job today, you guys"
(Gabe to puppets says: "."
(Book to Bee says: ") You were late on your cue"
(Book to Bee says: "!"
(Bee says: ") WHAT"
(Bee says: "?"
(Normal says: ") Hey hey, be good to each other"
(Normal says: "."
(Normal says: "We're all stars."
Mabel says: "And I'm up!"
Gabe says: "Oh, hey, I'm Gabe."
Gabe says: "Master of puppets."
Gabe says: "Nice to meet you."
Mabel says: "You're amazing with those puppets."
Gabe says: "Really?"
Gabe says: "A lot of people think puppets are dumb, or, just for kids or something."
Mabel says: "Are you kidding me?"
Mabel says: "I'm puppet-CRAZY!"
Mabel says: "People call me Puppet-Crazy-Mabel!"
Gabe says: "Really?"
Gabe says: "People used to call me Puppet-Crazy-Gabe!"
Gabe says: "So when's your next puppet show?"
Mabel says: "My huh?"
Gabe says: "I mean, you can't truly love puppets if you're not throwing puppet shows, right?"
Mabel says: "Ha, yeah, I mean I'm TOTALLY working on a puppet show."
Gabe says: "Oh, what are the details?"
Mabel says: "There are soooo many details..."
Dipper says: "So, how'd it go?"
Mabel says: "Dipper, how hard do you think it'd be to write and compose a sock puppet rock opera with lights, original music and live pyrotechnics by Friday?"
Dipper says: "Mabel, are you serious?"
Mabel says: "I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED!"
Mabel says: "I got lost in his eyes and his ponytails and I'm gonna be so embarrassed on Friday if I don't have ANYTHING."
Dipper says: "What about cracking this password?"
Dipper says: "You know, mystery twins?"
Mabel says: "If you help me with this for JUST a couple of days I promise I'll help with the password!"
Mabel says: "Please, pretty please!"
Mabel says: "It's for love, Dipper."
Mabel says: "YES!"
Mabel says: "THANK YOU!!"
Mabel says: "THIS GUY!"
Mabel says: "HE'S NUMBER ONE!!!"
Dipper says: "Okay, okay, okay, shhhh..."
Dipper says: "I can't wait to get to the bottom of this laptop."
Dipper says: "We're close to something big here; I can feel it..."
Bill's shadow follows them while walking out of the library. Montage of Dipper and Mabel preparing for the opera and Dipper trying to figure out the password. Cuts to everyone Mabel, Dipper, Soos, Wendy, and Waddles in the living room, working on the puppets.
Mabel says: "Alright."
Mabel says: "This is gonna be called Glove Story: A Sock Opera."
Mabel says: "Just to warn you, people's eyes will get wet."
Mabel says: "Cause they'll be crying."
Mabel says: "From laughter!"
Mabel says: "From how tragic it is."
Wendy Corduroy says: "Come on, Dipper, you gotta roll with Mabel's craziness."
Wendy Corduroy says: "It's what makes life worth living."
Everyone says: "Loooooovvvvveeee!"
Stan Pines says: "Not even gonna ask."
Cut to the evening with Mabel putting puppets around her bed.
Mabel says: "Goodnight, my babies."
Mabel says: "Mwop mwop mwop mwop."
Mabel says: "Mwah!"
Computer beeps.
Dipper says: "Ugh, wrong password, WRONG, WRONG!"
Dipper says: "UGH!"
Mabel says: "Don't stay up all night, Dipper."
Mabel says: "Last time you got this sleep-deprived you tried to eat your own shirt."
Dipper says: "There has to be some shortcut or clue."
Dipper says: "Who would know about secret codes?"
Wind blows. An eye creeps around the moon, and bricks form around it to reveal Bill. Color vanishes from the world.
Bill Cipher says: "I THINK I KNOW A GUY."
Commercial break says: "Bill Cipher: Well, well, well."
Commercial break says: "You're awfully persistent, Pine Tree."
Commercial break says: "Hats off to you!"
Dipper says: "You again!"
Bill says: "Did you miss me?"
Bill says: "Admit it, you missed me."
Dipper says: "Hardly."
Dipper says: "You worked with Gideon!"
Dipper says: "You tried to destroy my uncle's mind!"
Bill says: "It was just a job, kid!"
Bill says: "No hard feelings!"
Bill says: "I've been keeping an  since then, and I must say I'm impressed!"
Dipper says: "Really?"
Bill says: "You deserve a prize!"
Bill says: "Here, have a head that's always screaming!"
Screaming head says: "Aah!"
Screaming head says: "Aah!"
Screaming head says: "Aah!"
Screaming head says: "..."
Dipper says: "Ah!"
Bill says: "- in return."
Dipper says: "I'd never do a favor for you!"
Dipper says: "Don't forget who defeated you last time!"
Bill says: "Hey, wanna hear my impression of you in about three seconds?"
Bill says: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!"
Dipper says: "AAAAAAAAAAAAH!!"
Cut to Stan in kitchen.
Mabel says: "Hey, I'm puppet Staaaannn!"
Stan says: "Still ignoring this."
Stan says: "Woah, bag check for Dipper's eyes."
Stan says: "Ha ha!"
Stan says: "Nobody?"
Mabel says: "Dipper, I told you to get some sleep last night!"
Mabel says: "Here, wake up with some Mabel Juice."
Mabel says: "It has plastic dinosaurs in it!"
Stan says: "It's like if coffee and nightmares had a baby!"
Dipper says: "Mabel, listen, last night I had a dream with Bill in it."
Mabel says: "Wait, hold up, the triangle guy?"
Dipper says: "He said he'd give me the code to the laptop if I gave him something."
Dipper says: "Like I'd actually trust Bill, right?"
Mabel says: "Don't worry, bro."
Mabel says: "Today's the day that the mystery twins are back in action."
Mabel says: "I'll help you crack that code."
Mabel says: "I've just got to hand off my puppet stuff to my production crew."
Dipper says: "Production crew?"
Cut to Candy and Grenda outside the Mystery Shack covered in socks.
Candy Chiu says: "We read the script."
Candy Chiu says: "Very emotional."
Grenda says: "I cried like eight times."
Gabe says: "Hey ladies."
Mabel says: "GABE!"
Gabe says: "I was just bladin' by."
Gabe says: "Helps me dry out my ponytail after a shower."
Gabe says: "Ah, ah."
Grenda says: "Hubbity-hubbuty."
Mabel says: "It's so great to see you!"
Mabel says: "I was just working on the world's greatest puppet show."
Mabel says: "IT HAS PUPPETS!"
Gabe says: "Your passion is so refreshing, Mabel."
Gabe says: "Unlike the girl from last night's puppet show."
Gabe says: "Single-stich on one puppet, and cross-stitch on the other?"
Gabe says: "I was like, "Uh-uh!"
Mabel says: "Cross-huh?"
Gabe says: "Naturally I deleted her off my cell phone contacts list."
Mabel says: "NATURALLY!"
Mabel says: "Hahahaha!"
Gabe says: "I know you won't let me down."
Gabe says: "Based on what you said the other day, you must be a puppet expert."
Grenda says: "You know, Gabe, you look pretty sweaty."
Grenda says: "You should really take your shirt off."
Grenda says: "Right?"
Grenda says: "Aren't we all thinking that?"
Gabe says: "Later, ladies."
Mabel says: "GWAAA!!"
Mabel says: "We gotta up our game, girls!"
Mabel says: "Did you hear that thing he said about the stitches?!"
Mabel says: "!"
Grenda says: "Don't worry, Mabel, your crew can handle it!"
Grenda says: "Oops."
Candy says: "How many eyes does a face have again?"
Soos says: "Ah!"
Soos says: "I'm not okay!"
Mabel says: "AAA!"
Mabel says: "Okay, I'm back on fabrication."
Mabel says: "Get me my lint roller!"
Dipper says: "Whoa, whoa!"
Dipper says: "Hey, you just said you were going to help me!"
Mabel says: "DIPPER!"
Mabel says: "This sock crisis just bumped up to code argyle!"
Mabel says: "The laptop can wait!"
Dipper says: "Mabel, do you seriously think that your random crush of the week is more important than uncovering the mysteries of this town?"
Dipper says: "You're obsessed!"
Mabel says: "I'm obsessed?"
Mabel says: "Look at you!"
Mabel says: "You look like a vampire!"
Mabel says: "And not the hot kind!"
Dipper says: "But you said you were going to help me today!"
Dipper says: "Ha!"
Dipper says: "Ha!"
Dipper says: "Ha!"
Dipper says: "Oh, man..."
Computer says: "Too many failed entries."
Computer says: "Initiate data erase in five minutes."
Dipper says: "No!"
Dipper says: "Noonono!"
Dipper says: "I'm gonna lose everything?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Dipper says: "I only have one more try?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Everything turns black and white and Bill appears.
Bill says: "Well, well, well."
Bill says: "Someone's looking desperate."
Dipper says: "I thought I told you to leave me alone."
Bill says: "I can help you, kid."
Bill says: "You just need to hear out my demands."
Dipper says: "Uh, what crazy thing do you want anyway?"
Dipper says: "To eat my soul?"
Dipper says: "To rip out my teeth?"
Dipper says: "Are you gonna replace my eyes with baby heads or something?"
Bill says: "Yeesh, kid, relax."
Bill says: "All I want is a puppet!"
Dipper says: "A puppet?"
Dipper says: "What are you playing at?"
Bill says: "Everyone loves puppets."
Bill says: "And it looks to me that you've got a surplus."
Dipper says: "I don't know, man."
Dipper says: "Mabel worked really hard on these."
Bill says: "Seems to me one little puppet is a small price to pay to learn all the secrets of the universe."
Bill says: "."
Dipper says: "Uh, just one puppet?"
Dipper says: "Fine!"
Dipper says: "So what puppet are you gonna pick, anyway?"
Bill says: "Hmm, let's see."
Bill says: "Eenie meenie mynie..."
Dipper says: "Huh?"
Dipper says: "This can't be happening!"
Dipper says: "What did you do to my body?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Bill says: "AHAHAHA!"
Dipper says: "Oh my gosh, this can't be happening."
Dipper says: "This can't be happening!"
Dipper says: "I don't understand!"
Dipper says: "Why are you doing this?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Dipper says: "I thought we had a deal!"
Bill says: "Look kid, you've been getting way too close to figuring out some major answers."
Bill says: "I've got big plans comin' and I don't need you gettin' in my way."
Bill says: "Destroying that laptop was a cinch."
Bill says: "Now I just need to destroy your journal."
Bill says: "Race ya to the bottom of the stairs!"
Dipper says: "Hey!"
Bill says: "Boy, these arms are durable."
Dipper says: "I've hidden it!"
Dipper says: "Somewhere you'll never find it in a million years!"
Mabel says: "Hey Dipper!"
Bill says: "Sure, sounds great, sister!"
Bill says: "I'll see you at the show!"
Dipper says: "Wait!"
Dipper says: "No, Mabel, don't listen to him!"
Dipper says: "That's not me!"
Bill says: "Heh!"
Bill says: "welcome to the mindscape, kid!"
Bill says: "Without a vessel to possess, you're basically a ghost!"
Soos Ramirez says: "Oh, hey Dipper!"
Soos Ramirez says: "There you are!"
Wendy says: "What up, dude?"
Dipper says: "Soos!"
Dipper says: "Wendy!"
Dipper says: "Help me!"
Soos says: "We're heading to the theater."
Wendy says: "Need a ride, Dipper?"
Bill says: "Oho, anything for you, Red!"
Dipper says: "I'm gonna stop you, Bill!"
Dipper says: "I'm gonna find that journal before you do and I'm gonna stop you!!"
Cut to the outside of the Theatre Time Theater. Dipper flies out of a nearby building.
Dipper says: "Bill?"
Dipper says: "Bill!"
Dipper says: "I gotta get my body back before he does something crazy with it."
Bill says: "Aw, nothing like the theater, huh toots?"
Bill says: "Hey Soos, wanna hear the exact time and date of your death?"
Soos says: "Heheh, okay!"
Mabel says: "Hey guys!"
Mabel says: "You all made it!"
Stan says: "Are you kidding me?"
Stan says: "I would never miss..."
Stan says: "whatever this is."
Bill says: "By the by, Mabel, where'd you put my journal again?"
Mabel says: "I used it as a prop for the big wedding scene!"
Mabel says: "I still need a reverend, though."
Bill says: "Hey, what if I play the reverend?"
Bill says: "I mean, someone's gotta hold that journal, right?"
Mabel says: "Right!"
Mabel says: "Let's go!"
Dipper says: "Oh, no!"
Dipper says: "Wait!"
Dipper says: "Mabel!"
Mabel peeks through the curtain. Gabe is sitting down with his puppets. The lights flicker.
Grenda says: "The show is about to begin!"
Grenda says: "Please turn off your cell phones!"
Grenda says: "Unless you're texting me, cuties!"
The house lights dim, and, to applause, the curtain opens. The set is a glittery and colorful Mystery Shack. A light illuminates Candy, standing at a keyboard, dressed as David Bowie.
Candy says: "Gather round, and let us sing, about a girl who had almost everything."
She is rolled off the stage. A Dipper puppet pops out of a window and sings.
(As Puppet Mabel says: ") Hi there"
(As Puppet Mabel says: "!"
(As Puppet Soos says: ") Did you say stable"
(As Puppet Soos says: "?"
(As Puppet Stan says: ") No, he said Mabel"
(As Puppet Stan says: "!"
(As Puppet Mabel says: ") Okay, hit it, boys"
(As Puppet Mabel says: "!!"
(Singing as puppets says: ") Who's that girl with the pig and the braces"
(Singing as puppets says: "?"
(Singing as puppets says: "She puts smiles on everyone's faces!"
(Singing as puppets says: "When she's around, you're never bored!"
(As Puppet mayor says: ") I am a mayor, and here's an award"
(As Puppet mayor says: "!"
(Singing as Puppet Mabel says: ") Thank you, mayor, it's true I'm great"
(Singing as Puppet Mabel says: "."
(Singing as Puppet Mabel says: "But the perfect girl needs the perfect maaaate..."
(As Puppet Gabe says: ") Hey, what's up, I'm Gabe"
(As Puppet Gabe says: "."
(As Puppet Mabel says: ") Bwaaaa"
(As Puppet Mabel says: "?"
Bill says: "So, hey, Grendo!"
Bill says: "Where's that book prop I'm using for the wedding scene?"
Grenda says: "It's up in the wedding cake."
Grenda says: "But that doesn't come down until Act 3."
Grenda says: "So hold your horses!"
Bill says: "Oh, I'll hold my horses."
Bill says: "I'll hold them..."
Bill says: "you monster."
Mabel says: "Finally, we're together."
(As Puppet Gabe says: ") I'm sorry, Mabel, but I have to go fight"
(As Puppet Gabe says: "."
(As Puppet Gabe says: "In the war!"
(As Puppet Mabel says: ") I'll wait for you, Gabe"
(As Puppet Mabel says: "!"
(As Puppet Mabel says: "I'll wait for you!!"
Grenda says: "Our intermission has begun!"
Grenda says: "Mill about!"
Dipper says: "Pst, Mabel!"
Mabel says: "Aah!"
Mabel says: "It's come to life!"
Mabel says: "The puppetbooks didn't warn me about this!"
Dipper says: "Mabel, it's me, Dipper!"
Dipper says: "You need to help me!"
Mabel says: "Wait, what, Dipper?!"
Mabel says: "!"
Mabel says: "But you're..."
Mabel says: "so much more of a sock than usual!"
Dipper says: "Mabel, you have to listen."
Dipper says: "Bill tricked me!"
Dipper says: "He stole my body and now he's after the journal!"
Dipper says: "You have to find the journal before Bill destroys it."
Dipper says: "It's the only hope to get me back in my body!"
Mabel says: "But my cue's coming up any minute!"
Gabe says: "Hey, Mabel, do you have a moment?"
Mabel says: "GABE!"
Dipper says: "Ow!"
Dipper says: "Mabel!"
Gabe says: "Mabel, it's clear to me now that you really love puppets."
Gabe says: "I mean, you went whole hog."
Gabe says: "And if you stick the ending, well, maybe later you could join me for a biscotti?"
Mabel says: "You drive a biscotti?"
Gabe says: "I'll be waiting."
Mabel says: "Did you hear that?"
Mabel says: "He loves it!"
Mabel says: "This play has to be flawless."
Mabel says: "Can't we wait until after the show?"
Dipper says: "Mabel!"
Dipper says: "You want me to be a sock puppet forever?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Mabel says: "I'm sorry, it- it looks funny when you're mad."
Mabel says: "Okay, okay, okay, just take over for me till I get back with the book."
Mabel says: "Little puppet face!"
Cut to the stage. Dipper is providing the voices for the puppets.
Dipper says: "Gabe!"
Dipper says: "You're back from the war!"
(As Puppet Gabe says: ") Yes I am"
(As Puppet Gabe says: "!"
(As Puppet Gabe says: "Wanna kiss and sing at the same time?"
(As Puppet Mabel says: ") Okay"
(As Puppet Mabel says: "!"
(To himself says: ") Seriously"
(To himself says: "?"
The audience applauds. Mabel climbs the catwalk and runs over to where the giant cake is hanging. The journal sits inside. Mabel climbs over the edge and reaches for the journal.
Mabel says: "Come on, come on!"
Dipper says: "I hope this kiss never ends!"
Mabel says: "Come on, come on now, there must be a way to get Dipper's body back!"
Bill says: "Oho, but why would you want to do that?"
Mabel says: "Bill Dipper!"
Mabel says: "Bipper."
Bill says: "Shh!"
Bill says: "You wouldn't want to ruin the show..."
Bill says: "Whoops!"
Bill says: "It's slipping!"
Bill says: "How's about you hand that book over?"
Mabel says: "No way!"
Mabel says: "This is Dipper's!"
Mabel says: "I'd never give it away!"
Bill says: "Hmm, you didn't seem to have a problem taking it for your own play, ditching him when he needed you."
Bill says: "So come to your senses."
Bill says: "Give me the book or your play is ruined."
Bill says: "There it is."
Bill says: "I mean, who would sacrifice everything they've worked for just for their dumb sibling?"
Mabel says: "Dipper would."
Bill says: "Huh?"
Mabel says: "Get out of my brother's body, you evil triangle!"
Stan says: "Whoa!"
Stan says: "Children fighting!"
Stan says: "I can sell this."
Bill says: "You can't stop me!"
Bill says: "I'm a being of pure energy with no weakness!"
Mabel says: "True, but you're in Dipper's body."
Mabel says: "And I know all his weaknesses!"
Mabel says: "Tickle, tickle!"
Bill says: "Aah!"
Bill says: "Body spasms!"
Bill says: "What are these?"
Mabel says: "A little note about the human body- You haven't slept for 24 hours!"
Mabel says: "Also, I got a full night's sleep and I'm on four mega-shots of Mabel Juice!"
Bill says: "My body is burning!"
Bill says: "I can't move these stupid noodle legs!"
Bill says: "Curse you, useless flesh sticks!"
Bill says: "Body..."
Bill says: "shutting down..."
Bill says: "must..."
Bill says: "scratch..."
Bill says: "mosquito bites..."
Dipper and Mabel watch as Bill stumbles around, then he collapses. Bill shoots out of Dipper's body and the world turns black and white.
Bill says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.."
Bill says: "hey!"
Dipper says: "Hey!"
Dipper says: "Yes!"
Dipper says: "I'm in my own body!"
Dipper says: "And it's..."
Dipper says: "just as underwhelming as I remember."
Dipper says: "Ooh, everything hurts."
Bill says: "This isn't the last you'll hear of me!"
Bill says: "Big things are coming!"
Bill says: "You can't stop me!"
Mabel says: "I'm sorry, Gabe."
She pushes the "Big Finish" button. Bill is revealed to be on a pile of pyrotechnics, which explodes, sending fireworks shooting into the audience and blowing up the box of puppets. In slow motion, the Grunkle Stan puppet arcs through the air, aflame, as Gabe, amid falling puppets, looks on in shock. "Ave Maria" plays mournfully.
The rest of the fireworks go off in a cacophonous boom, and Dipper gleefully stomps on the Dipper puppet. As the smoke clears from the smoldering set, the twins turn to the audience. Some scaffolding crashes to the floor behind them.
Mabel says: "Don't worry."
Mabel says: "I've seen enough movies to know this is the part where the audience thinks it was all part of the show and loves it."
Mabel says: "Cue applause!"
The audience stares at them and starts to boo. They get up and leave the theater, grumbling about how they almost died. Gabe stands, frowning.
Mabel says: "Gabe!"
Mabel says: "Stick around for the wrap party?"
Mabel says: "We've got mini-quiches!"
Gabe says: "Don't speak to me, Mabel."
Gabe says: "You've made a mockery of my art form."
Gabe says: "Let's go, my loves."
Dipper says: "Did he just make out with his puppets?"
Mabel says: "I might've dodged a bullet there."
Dipper says: "Oof."
Dipper says: "Mabel, I'm sorry about all this."
Dipper says: "It's my fault your puppets got ruined."
Mabel says: "Well, one of them survived."
Mabel says: "Mystery twins?"
Dipper says: "Mystery twins."
Dipper says: "Ow!"
Dipper says: "What'd Bill do to my hand?"
Dipper says: "Ahh!"
Mabel says: "Nothing a little sleep can't fix."
Mabel says: "Come on, bro bro, let's go home."
Dipper says: "Seriously, I need to go to the hospital."
End credits. Real-life Dipper and Mabel puppets.
Mabel Puppet says: "Hey Dipper, what did one sock puppet say to the other sock puppet?"
Dipper Puppet says: "I don't know Mabel, what?"
Mabel Puppet says: "You look like you could use a HAND!"
McGucket Puppet says: "That joke was really something!"
Stan Puppet says: "Yeah, something terrible!"
Mabel wakes up with a scream. She turns the Mabel puppet away from her bed and goes back to sleep.
