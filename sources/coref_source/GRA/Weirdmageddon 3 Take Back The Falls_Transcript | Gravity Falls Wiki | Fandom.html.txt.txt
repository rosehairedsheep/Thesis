Dipper says: "So..."
Dipper says: "what's everyone doing here?"

Pacifica says: "Even in a sack I still look better than you."

Rumble says: "Do not be afraid."
Rumble says: "Weirdmageddon has taught me, there are some battles I cannot win."
Rumble says: "I am now Humble McSkirmish."
Mabel says: "Grunkle Stan, how'd this all happen?"
Stan says: "So I was hammering signs out back when the sky started vomiting nightmares."
Stan says: "I listen to a lot of AM radio so I knew what this meant: the end of the world."
Dipper says: "Of course, the unicorn spell."
Dipper says: "That's why this is the only place Bill's magic can't touch."
Stan says: "That's when Possum Breath over here shows up leading a bunch of injured stragglers through the forest."
Stan says: "They needed a place to stay and since the mayor got captured, I elected myself de facto chief."
Stan says: "The plan's to stay in here and eat Brown Meat until we run out,Â then I vote we eat the gnomes."
Jeff says: "Hey!"
Jeff says: "I'm short, not deaf!"
Stan says: "Shh!"
Stan says: "Shh!"
Stan says: "Stress will make you chewy."
Dipper says: "Grunkle Stan, we can't all just hide inside the Shack."
Dipper says: "There's a town in need of saving."
Dipper says: "Me and Ford tried to do it, but he got captured by Bill."
Stan says: "You know Shiatzu?"
Multi-Bear says: "Yes, I've taken some classes."
Dipper says: "So you're really just gonna let Bill win?"
Stan says: "Look, kiddo."
Stan says: "We got a good deal here."
Stan says: "Besides, I'm sure wherever the rest of the townsfolk are, they're fine."
Shandra Jimenez says: "This is Shandra Jimenez reporting live from the inside of Bill's castle."
Shandra Jimenez says: "Here for the first time are images of what's happened to the captured townsfolk."
Shandra Jimenez says: "Viewers are advised to look away if they don't want to see their friends turned into a twisted throne of human agony."
Pacifica says: "Mom and Dad?"
Wendy says: "My family!"
Sheriff Blubs says: "Deputy Durland!"
Shandra says: "Is there no one who will save the people of this town?"
Shandra says: "I'm Shandra Jimenez and I'm being turned into stone by a flying eyeball."
Everyone gasps.
Pacifica says: "Oh, no."
Pacifica says: "My parents are bad but even they don't deserve to be turned to stone."
Dipper says: "Mabel is right."
Dipper says: "Bill wants us to run and hide."
Dipper says: "He wants us to think he's invincible."
Dipper says: "But Ford told me before he was captured that he knows Bill's secret weakness."
The refugees perk up and start muttering.
Wendy says: "Weakness?"
Dipper says: "Now, if we band together, if we combine all of our strength, our smarts, our..."
Dipper says: "whatever Toby has..."
Toby says: "Various rashes!"
Dipper says: "..."
Dipper says: "then we just might be able to rescue Ford, learn Bill's weakness, and save Gravity Falls!"
Everyone cheers.
Stan says: "Whoa!"
Stan says: "Whoa!"
Stan says: "Whoa!"
Stan says: "Have you all forgotten who's in charge here?"
Stan says: "Besides, we're only safe inside!"
Stan says: "It's not like we can take the Mystery Shack to Bill."
McGucket says: "Wha--Whoa!"
McGucket says: "Holy hootenany!"

McGucket says: "You just..."
Soos says: "Don't worry, Ford!"
Soos says: "We're coming for you!"
Cut to Bill unfreezing Ford at the Fearamid.
Ford says: "Let me go, you insane three-sided--!"
Ford says: "Wha--What is this place?"
Bill says: "We'll meet again."
Bill says: "Don't know where, don't know when."
Bill says: "Oh, I know we'll meet again some sunny day."
Ford says: "Wh-where am I?"
Bill says: "You're in the penthouse suite, kid!"
Bill says: "The tip of the pyramid."
Bill says: "Have a drink."
Bill says: "You know that couch is made from living human skin?"
The couch groans as eyes, a nose, and a mouth appear. Ford jumps up.
Ford says: "Aaah!"
Ford says: "Quit the games, Cipher!"
Ford says: "If I'm still alive you must want something from me."
Bill says: "Ah, sharp as ever, Fordsy."
Bill says: "As you may have noticed..."
Ford says: "Ooph!"
Bill says: "You think those chains are tight?"
Bill says: "As it turns out, my weirdness can't escape the magical confines of this town."
Bill says: "There's something keeping me in."
Ford says: "Incredible!"
Ford says: "Gravity Falls natural law of weirdness magnetism."
Ford says: "I studied this years ago!"
Bill says: "And did you find a way to undo it?"
Ford says: "Of course."
Ford says: "There's a simple equation that could collapse the barrier."
Ford says: "But I'd never tell you!"
Bill says: "Listen, Ford, if you just tell me that equation, finally your dimension will be free."
Bill says: "Anything will be possible."
Bill says: "I'll remake a fun world-- a better world!"
Bill says: "A party that never ends with a host that never dies!"
Bill says: "No more restrictions!"
Bill says: "No more laws!"
Bill says: "You'd be one of us."
Bill says: "All-powerful."
Bill says: "Greater than anything you've imagined!"
Bill says: "And all I need is your help."
Ford says: "You're insane if you think I'll help you."
Bill says: "Ha ha ha!"
Bill says: "I'm insane either way, brainiac."
Bill says: "But have it your way."
Bill says: "I'll just fish around and get that equation directly out of your mind!"
Ford says: "Not so fast!"
Ford says: "You know the rules, Bill."
Ford says: "You may be able to haunt my dreams but you can't enter my mind unless I shake your hand and let you in."
Bill says: "You're making this so much harder than it needs to be."
Bill says: "Everyone has a weakness, tough guy!"
Bill says: "I'll make you talk!"
Bill says: "It's only a matter of time."
Cut to the Mystery Shack.
McGucket says: "Alright."
McGucket says: "I've made some thingamadiculous robomajigs in my day, but this is the first one that won't be used for evil."
Dipper says: "Whoa!"
Dipper says: "These blueprints are incredible, McGucket."
Mabel says: "This is your most amazing invention yet."
Soos says: "Question, does it have any gun-swords?"
Soos says: "I watch a lot of anime and, uh, trust me, you're gonna want some gun-swords."
McGucket says: "What's an "anime"?"
Soos says: "We have much to discuss."
Stan says: "Discuss nothing!"
Stan says: "These scribbles are a bunch of cockamamie balderdash!"
Stan says: "Excuse my French."
French lilliputtian says: "Je ne sais quoi sacrebleu au revoir!"
French lilliputtian says: "I don't believe that was French."
Stan says: "And where would you even find a bunch of idiots who would be crazy enough to build it?"
Mabel says: "Grunkle Stan, you're looking at those idiots."
Everyone cheers.
Soos says: "Idiots!"
Cut to montage of the refugees building the robot says: "McGucket points out the parts needed, then people raid the junkyard; cut to people taking stuff from inside the shack."
Stan says: "Whoa-what!"
Stan says: "What are you--?"
Stan says: "H-hey now!"
Stan says: "Hey hey!"
Stan says: "Don't touch that!"
Stan says: "Hey!"
Stan says: "Aah!"
Cut to people digging a dinosaur out from the Abandoned mines; Soos showing McGucket anime while the latter takes notes; cuts all the parts being put together and to a "Take Back the Falls" flag. Cut to everyone outside the Shack wearing Mabel's sweaters.
Soos says: "Thanks for these apocalypse sweaters, Mabel."
Soos says: "The end of the world has never been so comfortable."
Some of the refugees nod and hum in agreement.
Pacifica says: "But I'm not gonna like it."
Mabel says: "Admit it."
Mabel says: "This is the best day of the end of the world."
Mabel says: "I think we actually have a chance to beat Bill and win back our future."
Dipper says: "Yeah."
Dipper says: "Getting to actually live to see our 13th birthday party is the only birthday present I want right now."
Soos says: "Hey, if we're lucky enough to get there, I guarantee this whole town is gonna throw you the best birthday party you've ever seen."
Dipper says: "Thanks, Soos."
Dipper says: "Hey, has anyone seen Grunkle Stan?"
Stan says: "This whole plan is bonkers."
Stan says: "But of course no one asked the chief what he thinks."
Stan says: "After all I've done for everyone!"
Shmebulock says: "Shmebulock!"
Stan says: "Yeah, exactly, it's a total load of Shmebulock."
Mabel says: "Is something wrong, Grunkle Stan?"
Mabel says: "You're acting grunklier than usual."
Stan says: "It's this darn plan to save my brother."
Stan says: "If you didn't notice, I already saved him once from that portal, and he never thanked me!"
Stan says: "He causes the end of the world, and somehow it's still always "Stan's the screw-up."
Stan says: "Ford's the hero."
Dipper says: "Well maybe people think he's a hero because he didn't want to hide in the Mystery Shack!"
Stan says: "Well maybe if he hid in the Mystery Shack, he wouldn't have been captured!"
Mabel says: "Guys!"
Mabel says: "Guys!"
Mabel says: "Trust me, tomorrow's gonna be great!"
Mabel says: "I believe in us."
Chutzpar says: "Help!"
Chutzpar says: "Leader Mabel!"

Mabel says: "Coming!"
Cut to the next morning. Gompers walks across a barren wasteland and bleats.
McGucket says: "Alright, fellas."
McGucket says: "Let's hope this turns out better than my other inventions."
Mabel says: "Everybody ready?"
Mabel says: "Dipper, now!"
Dipper pulls a lever, causing wheels to turn. Machinery begins running and the invention starts moving. As the invention stands up, the refugees are tossed side-to-side inside the Shack.
Cut to Bud Gleeful burning some Gideon dolls.
Bud Gleeful says: "Forgive me, boy."
Bud Gleeful says: "Your hyperflamable merchandise is the only thing keepin' me going."
Bud Gleeful says: "What in blazes?"
The robot approaches the Fearamid.
Ford says: "No!"
Ford says: "No!"
Ford says: "Noooo!!"
Ford says: "Aaaagh!"
Bill says: "Ready to talk now?"
Ford says: "I won't."
Ford says: "I won't let you into my mind."
Bill says: "What do you think, pals?"
Bill says: "Another 500 volts?"
Bill says: "Hey, do you hear that?"
The robot's t-rex head crashes through the Fearamid and roars.
Bill says: "What?!"
Bill says: "!"
Bill says: "I just fixed that door!"
The Mystery Shack robot comes into full view.
Soos says: "It's the Shacktron, dude!"
Wax Larry King says: "They made the house into a robot."
Wax Larry King says: "Fascinating!"
Bill says: "So the mortals are trying to fight back, huh?"
Bill says: "Adorable!"
Bill says: "Henchmaniacs, you know what to do!"
Bill says: "Take them out!"
Bill's minions grow in size and jump out of the Fearamid to stand in front of the Mystery Shack.
Stan says: "This was a bad idea."
Soos says: "Heh."
Soos says: "Uh, I just wanted you monster dudes to hand over Ford or we'll have to, like, fight and junk."
Soos says: "Heh."
Soos says: "Hey, you're a little cutie."

Mabel says: "Maximum power!"
Dipper says: "And..."
Dipper says: "now!"
Bill says: "Guys, seriously?"
Bill says: "You had, like, one job to do here."
Ford says: "Bravo, Dipper and Mabel!"
Bill says: "Well, would you look at that."
Bill says: "Those kids really care about you."
Bill says: "And you care about them."
Bill says: "Don't you?"
Ford says: "What are you..."
Ford says: "."
Ford says: "Oh."
Ford says: "Oh no."
Bill says: "Perhaps torturing those kids'll make you talk."
Ford says: "No."
Ford says: "No!"
Ford says: "Not the kids!"
Stan says: "Ah!"
Mabel says: "ATTACK!"
Bill says: "Aah!"
Bill says: "My eye!"
Bill says: "Do you have any idea how long it takes to regenerate that?!"
Bill says: "!"
Bill says: "?"
Dipper says: "We've got him distracted."
Dipper says: "Now's our chance."
Mabel says: "Rescue team, move out!"
Mabel puts her grappling hook in her sweater. Soos puts the memory erasing gun in his backpack. Dipper tests the height-altering crystal flashlight on a Mystery Shack snowglobe. Cut to Dipper, Mabel, Stan, Soos, Wendy, Pacifica and Sheriff Blubs standing in the exit tubes.
Dipper says: "Okay everyone."
Dipper says: "We get in, rescue Ford, get out, save the world."
Dipper says: "Piece of cake."
Pacifica says: "Just so we're clear."
Pacifica says: "If I die, I'm suing all of you."
Wendy says: "Now!"
Dipper says: "Oh, man, oh, man..."
Mabel says: "WOOHOO!"
Mabel says: "HAHAHA!"
They open their parachutes as they approach the Fearamid. They all land and remove their parachutes. All of them gasp upon seeing Bill's throne.
Dipper says: "Oh, man."
Dipper says: "It looks even worse up close."
Mabel says: "He's golden."
Mabel says: "But not in the good way!"
Stan says: "Great!"
Stan says: "Grab him and let's get out of here."
Dipper says: "But how are we going to unfreeze them?"
Mabel says: "Gideon!"
Mabel says: "What happened to you?"
Gideon says: "Bill captured me."
Gideon says: "He's been forcing me to do cute dances in this cage for all eternity."
Gideon says: "I'm so tired of being cute!"
Dipper says: "How do we undo this?"
Gideon says: "Mayor Tyler."
Gideon says: "He's the load-bearing human."
Gideon says: "Pull him out, and the whole thing goes down."
Dipper pulls at Tyler's arm. He rattles before turning back to normal and breaking free. This sets off a chain reaction, causing the chair to collapse. As it does, the residents are returned to normal. Deputy Durland hits Gideon's cage, knocking it down and breaking it, freeing Gideon.

Ford says: "I--I haven't seen you since we parted ways."
Ford says: "You must hate me."
McGucket says: "I've tried forgettin'."
McGucket says: "Maybe I should try forgiving."
McGucket says: "Come here, old friend."
Stan says: "Hey, good to see you too, bro."
Stan says: "Now let's get outta here, huh?"
Dipper says: "Listen, Uncle Ford, we don't have a lot of time."
Dipper says: "Remember how you told me right before you were frozen that you knew Bill's weakness?"
Mabel says: "Yeah, a secret way to defeat him?"
Ford says: "I--I do!"
Dipper says: "Uh, we've got Bill outside, but I don't know how long we can keep him occupied."
Ford says: "Yes, yes."
Ford says: "Good, good."
Stan says: "Drawing a circle on the floor."
Stan says: "Well, he's lost his mind."
Ford says: "My mind is fine."
Ford says: "And there is a way to beat him."
Ford says: "With this."
Shot pulls back to show that Ford has drawn the Zodiac.
Pacifica says: "The world's most confusing game of hopscotch?"
Ford says: "No, a prophecy."
Ford says: "Although it would be a pretty fun game of hopscotch."

Ford says: "It's too dangerous!"
The people not in the circle run away.
Ford says: "We just need one more person..."
Ford says: "Stanley!"
Ford says: "Stanley, get over here."
Ford says: "You're the only one left."
Stan says: "You realize this is a bunch of hogwash, right?"
Stan says: "You really think some caveman graffiti is gonna stop that monster?"
Gideon says: "Dang it, old man!"
Gideon says: "Now's not the time!"
Wendy says: "Come on!"
Pacifica says: "What are you doing?"
Pacifica says: "You're gonna ruin this!"
Robbie says: "I've never held hands this long and I am very uncomfortable."
Stan says: "Whoa."
Stan says: "Hey."
Stan says: "I'm not the enemy here, people."
Stan says: "Don't forget who literally created the end of the world."

Ford says: "I know."
Ford says: "Just help me fix it."
Ford says: "Please."
Stan says: "Fine."
Stan says: "Just do one thing."
Stan says: "Say "thank you."
Ford says: "What?"
Stan says: "I spent thirty years trying to bring you back into this dimension and you still haven't thanked me!"
Stan says: "You want me to shake your hand?"
Stan says: "Say "thank you."
Ford says: "Fine."
Ford says: "Thank you."

Ford says: "Don't jeopardize this, you idiot!"
Ford says: "Everything's on the line!"
Mabel says: "Guys, stop it!"
Dipper and Mabel pull at Stan and Ford, who are fighting and yelling unintelligibly at each other.
Dipper says: "Join hands!"
Ford and Stan stop fighting as Bill approaches.
Bill says: "Oh no, it's Bill!"
Bill says: "Right?"
Bill says: "Isn't that what you're all thinking?"
Bill says: "Hey, Gideon, why aren't you dancing?"
Bill says: "Chop chop, huh?"
Cut to first end card.
Bill says: "Ha ha ha ho!"
Bill says: "This is just too perfect!"
Bill says: "Didn't you brainiacs know the zodiac doesn't work if you don't all hold hands?"
Bill says: "And what's better, you've brought every threat to my power together in one easy-to-destroy CIRCLE!"
Dipper says: "Oh no!"
Pacifica says: "Ah!"
Pacifica says: "My hair!"
Robbie says: "Ah!"
Robbie says: "My hair also!"

McGucket says: "Hey!"
McGucket says: "You give them back!"
Gideon says: "You've gone too far, Cipher!"
Wendy says: "Yeah!"
Wendy says: "We're not scared of you!"
Bill says: "Oh, but you should be."
Mabel says: "Ah!"
Dipper says: "Oh no!"
Bill says: "You know, this castle could really use some decorATIONS!"
Bill says: "Looks like it's too late for your friends, Stanford."
Dipper and Mabel scream as a cage encases them.
Stan says: "Ah!"
Stan says: "Kids!"
Bill says: "But you can still save your family."
Bill says: "Last chance: tell me how to take Weirdmageddon global and I'll spare the kids!"
Dipper says: "No!"
Dipper says: "Don't do it!"
Mabel says: "Yeah!"
Mabel says: "Bill makes bad deals!"
Bill says: "Don't you toy with me, Shooting Star."
Bill says: "I see EVERYTHI--!"
Bill says: "Ow!"
Bill says: "Not again!"
Bill says: "Why?!"
Bill says: "!"
Bill says: "Every time!"
Stan says: "Nice shot, pumpkin."
Ford and Stan are released from Bill's arms and fall to the ground.
Bill says: "I just regenerated that eye!"
Mabel says: "I know that hurts because I've accidentally done it to myself!"
Mabel says: "Multiple times!"
Dipper pulls out the height-altering crystal flashlight and enlarges their cage. Dipper and Mabel jump out as Bill continues to scream in pain.
Dipper says: "Save yourselves."
Dipper says: "Run!"
Dipper says: "We'll take care of Bill!"
Ford says: "What?"
Ford says: "That's a suicide mission!"
Dipper says: "Trust us."
Dipper says: "We've beat him before..."
Mabel says: "..."
Mabel says: "and we'll beat him again!"
Mabel says: "Hey!"
Mabel says: "Bill!"
Mabel says: "Come and get us, you pointy jerk!"
Bill growls. Dipper and Mabel run off into the Fearamid. Before leaving, Mabel stretches her lips to blow a raspberry.
Ford says: "What?"
Ford says: "No!"
Ford says: "It's too dangerous!"
Ford and Stan start to run after Dipper and Mabel, but Bill puts them in a cage.
Stan says: "No!"
Stan says: "Wait!"
Stan says: "No!"
Stan says: "No!"
Stan says: "Oh, what do we do?"
Stan says: "What do we do?!"
Stan says: "!"
Ford says: "Kids!"
Dipper and Mabel run through the Fearamid, with Bill chasing them.
Bill says: "When I get my hands on you kids, I'm gonna DISSASEMBLE YOUR MOLECULES!"
Bill says: "You've tricked me for the last time!"
Cut to Ford and Stan.
Stan says: "Oh, I can't believe this."
Stan says: "The kids are gonna die and it's all my fault."
Stan says: "Because I couldn't shake your stupid hand!"
Stan says: "Uh, dad was right about me."
Stan says: "I am a screw-up."
Ford says: "Ah, don't blame yourself."
Ford says: "I'm the one who made a deal with Bill in the first place."
Ford says: "I fell for all his easy flattery."
Ford says: "You would have seen him for the scam artist he is."
Stan says: "How did things get so messed up between us?"
Ford says: "We used to be like Dipper and Mabel."
Ford says: "The world's about to end and they still work together."
Ford says: "How do they do it?"
Stan says: "Easy."
Stan says: "They're kids."
Stan says: "They don't know any better."
Stan says: "Whoa, where you goin'?"
Ford says: "I'm going to play the only card we have left."
Ford says: "Let Bill into my mind."
Ford says: "He'll be able to take over the galaxy and maybe even worse, but at least he might let the kids free."
Stan says: "What?!"
Stan says: "!"
Stan says: "Are you kiddin' me?!"
Stan says: "!"
Stan says: "Are you honestly telling me there's nothing else we can do?!"
Stan says: "!"
Ford says: "Bill's only weak in the mind space."
Ford says: "If I didn't have this darn plate in my head we could just erase him with the memory gun when he steps inside my mind."
Stan says: "What if he goes into my mind?"
Stan says: "My brain isn't good for anything."
Ford says: "Heheh."
Ford says: "There's nothing in your mind he wants."
Ford says: "It has to be me."
Ford says: "We need to take his deal."
Ford says: "It's the only way he'll agree to save you and the kids."
Stan says: "Do you really think he's gonna make good on that deal?"
Ford says: "What other choice do we have?"
Cut to Dipper and Mabel running through the Fearamid. They scream as they reach a dead end.
Dipper says: "You know, I'm starting to think there's no way out of here."
Mabel says: "Like Grunkle Stan always says, when one door closes, choose a nearby wall and bash it in with brute force!"
Dipper says: "Ha!"
Dipper says: "Now let's round up the townsfolk and together we can defeat..."
Dipper says: "oh, no!"
Grenda says: "You'll never take us alive, monsters!"
Teeth says: "That's fine with us!"
Dipper says: "Oh, no."
Bill says: "Peeka-boo!"
Dipper says: "Aaah!"
Mabel says: "Aaah!"
Stan says: "Wait!"
Stan says: "I surrender."
Bill says: "Good choice."
Ford says: "Don't do it, Ford, it'll destroy the universe!!"
Stan says: "It's the only way."
Bill says: "HAHAHAHA!"
Bill says: "Oh, even when you're about to die, you Pines twins just can't get along."
Stan says: "My only condition is that you let my brother and the kids go!"
Bill says: "Fine."
Dipper says: "No, Grunkle Ford!"
Dipper says: "Don't trust him!"
Bill says: "It's a..."
Bill says: "DEAL!"
Bill says: "WHAT?!"
Bill says: "!"
Stan says: "Heh heh!"
Stan says: "Do a pretty good impression of my brother, don't I?"
Stan says: "Switch clothes and no one can tell us apart."
Stan says: "Welcome to my mind."
Stan says: "Surprised you didn't recognize it."
Outside of Stan's mind, Ford takes off Stan's fez and pulls out the memory erasing gun. He enters "Stanley Pines" and aims it at his brother. Cut back to Stan's mind.
Bill says: "WHAT?!"
Bill says: "!"
Bill says: "The deal's off!!"
Bill says: "What the..."
Bill says: "No, no, no, no!"
The room starts to burn with blue fire.
Stan says: "Oh yeah."
Stan says: "You're going down, Bill."
Stan says: "You're gettin' erased."
Stan says: "Memory gun."
Stan says: "Pretty clever, huh?"
Bill says: "Y-you idiot!"
Bill says: "Don't you realize you're destroying your own mind, too?!"
Bill says: "!"
Stan says: "Eh."
Stan says: "It's not like I was using this space for much, anyway."
Bill says: "Let me outta here!"
Bill says: "Let me OUT!"
Bill says: "Why isn't this working?!"
Bill says: "!"
Stan says: "Hey, look at me."
Stan says: "Turn around and look at me, you one-eyed demon!"
Stan says: "You're a real wise-guy, but you made one fatal mistake: you messed with my family."
Bill says: "You're making a mistake!"
Bill says: "I'll give you anything!"
Bill says: "STAAANNLLEEEEY!"
Stan says: "Heh."
Stan says: "Guess I was good for something after all."
The flames engulf him. Cut to outside of Stan's mind. Once Ford finishes erasing Stan's memory he drops the memory erasing gun. The others from the wheel return to normal and drop to the floor. Outside of the Fearamid, the rift sucks all of the demons back into the Nightmare Realm through the portal. Teeth spits out Shmebulock as he gets pulled away.
The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity says: "Hey!"
The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity says: "Hey!"
The Fearamid is deconstructed and pulled into the rift. Once it is gone, a wave washes over the town, restoring it to its pre-Weirdmageddon state. The townsfolk look around, and Xyler, Craz and Rumble McSkirmish all fade away. The forest is shown with a bird landing on a statue of Bill, covered in moss and vegetation. Cut to another part of the forest with Stan still collapsed on the ground. He opens his eyes.
Mabel says: "Oh, my gosh!"
Mabel says: "Grunkle Stan, you did it!"
Stan says: "Oh, uh, hey there..."
Stan says: "kiddo."
Stan says: "What's your name?"
Mabel says: "Eheh."
Mabel says: "Grunkle Stan?"
Stan says: "Heh."
Stan says: "Who you talkin' to?"
Mabel says: "C-cmon."
Mabel says: "It's me."
Mabel says: "It's me, Grunkle Stan."
Mabel says: "Grunkle Stan, it's me!"
Ford says: "We had to erase his mind to defeat Bill."
Ford says: "It's all gone."
Ford says: "Stan has no idea, but he did it."
Ford says: "He saved the world."
Ford says: "He saved me."
Mabel sits down and cries. Dipper puts his hand on her shoulder and cries as well. Cut to everyone in front of the Mystery Shack, which is laying in a heap in the woods. They walk up to the door. Dipper punches the door until it comes down. Everyone walks into the living room, Dipper and Mabel holding Stan's hands.
Stan says: "Hey, this is a real nice place you got here."
Dipper says: "It's your place, Grunkle Stan."
Mabel says: "Don't you remember?"
Mabel says: "Even a little?"
Stan says: "Who's that big guy crying in the corner?"
Dipper says: "We saved the world, but what's the point?"
Dipper says: "Grunkle Stan's not himself anymore."
Mabel says: "There's gotta be something we can do to jog his memory."
Ford says: "There isn't."
Ford says: "I'm sorry."
Ford says: "Stan's gone."
Mabel says: "I know my Grunkle is in there somewhere."
Mabel says: "There's gotta be something around here that can help bring him back."
Dipper says: "That time we went fishing?"
Dipper says: "That Summerween we spent together?"
Dipper says: "Don't you remember anything?"
Stan says: "I'm sorry."
Stan says: "Gah!"
Stan says: "Quit it, Waddles!"
Stan says: "I'm trying to remember my life story!"
Dipper says: "What did you say?"
Stan says: "I said get Waddles off of me."
Ford says: "It's working."
Ford says: "Keep reading."
Soos says: "Skip to my page!"
Soos says: "He needs to remember our boss-employee relationship."
Stan says: "Hey, just cuz I have amnesia, don't go tryin' to give yourself a raise, Soos."
Dipper says: "It's happening!"
Dipper says: "Keep going!"
Mabel says: "Okay."
Mabel says: "Okay."
Mabel says: ""Day two."
Mabel says: "Grunkle Stan smells weird but we're starting to bond."
Mabel says: "He told us a lot about being a business man in the '80s and seemed happy when we pretended to listen."
Mabel says: "He also gave me a grappling hook which everyone is impressed by."
Mabel says: "And in more important news, I met some neighborhood hotties."
Everyone else laughs with her. Cut to a woodpecker landing on the Welcome to Gravity Falls sign. A gnome pops up and eats the bird.
Shandra says: "Good morning, Gravity Falls."
Shandra says: "It's another beautiful day, but every day is beautiful now that the..."
Shandra says: "unpleasantness is over."
Sprott says: "Git outta here, you ornery critters!"
Cut to a zombie popping out of the ground. Greg Valentino pushes it back into the ground with his foot.

Robbie says: "Ugh."
Robbie says: "Fine!"
Robbie says: "Whatever!"
Mayor Befufftlefumpter says: "Brains, and so forth."
Janice says: "Nope."
Janice says: "None of that, thank you."
Cut to Tyler Cutebiker standing on a podium in front of a crowd.
Tyler says: "None of us really understand what just happened and none of us want to."
Tyler says: "That's why I'm passing the Never Mind All That Act."
Tyler says: "If anyone goes asking around about the "events" of the last few days, what do we say?"
Crowd says: "Never mind all that!"
Sheriff Blubs says: "And if you break the rules, we're gonna zap you."
Deputy Durland says: "Zap!"
Deputy Durland says: "Zap!"
Deputy Durland says: "We're mad with power!"
Sheriff Blubs says: "And love."
Deputy Durland says: "And love."
Shandra Jimenez says: "In other news, the Northwest family has gone broke."
Shandra Jimenez says: "After pledging his allegiance to Bill and then placing all his savings in weirdness bonds, Preston Northwest had to sell his mansion to preserve his family fortune."
Cut to Preston and Priscilla crying as the some workers hand a "FOR SALE" banner on the gate.
Priscilla says: "You're only going to have one pony now."
Shot closes in on Pacifica's horrified face accompanied by dramatic music.
Shandra says: "But fortunes have also turned for local maniac, Fiddleford McGucket, who, after regaining his sanity, has made millions overnight submitting his patents to the US government."
McGucket says: "I'm gonna buy me a bigger shed!"
McGucket says: "Hey, that one's for sale!"
Shandra says: "In other good news, town hero, Stanley Pines, has fully recovered his memory and will be throwing a party to celebrate his niece and nephew's thirteenth birthday and final day in town."
Shandra says: "But other than that, I can safely say our beloved Gravity Falls is back to normal."
Shandra says: "And now, Bodacious T, with sports."
Toby Determined says: "It's called, "death ball."
Cut to Dipper and Mabel standing in front of a cake with many townsfolk.
Mabel says: "I can't believe you all got together just to throw a party for us."
Tyler says: "After all the Pines family has done for the town, it's the least we could do."
Tyler says: "You've helped everyone here."
Gideon says: "Thanks to y'all savin' us, I'm gonna learn to open my heart to kindness."
Gideon says: "No more evil-doin'."
Gideon says: "From now on, I'm gonna try to be Li'l Gideon, regular ol' kid."
Cut to Gideon at a park on a skateboard.
Gideon says: "Wa--oh!"
Gideon says: "Woo!"
Gideon says: "I'm bustin' a move on this skatin' board."
Gideon looks over at Ghost-Eyes and Killbone on the teeter-totter. He snaps his fingers and the two go after the boy. Offscreen, they beat him up and the boy screams. Gideon giggles. Cut back to the party.
Soos says: "Dude!"
Soos says: "Make a wish, dawg."
Dipper says: "You know, on my first day here, if you had asked me what I wanted, I would have said, "adventure, mystery, true friends."
Dipper says: "" But looking here at all of you I realize that every wish came true."
Dipper says: "I have everything I wanted."
Mabel says: "If I had only one wish it would be to shrink all of you with the shrink ray and bring you home with us in my pocket."
Mabel says: "But since that's impossible..."
Mabel says: "Is that impossible?"
Mabel says: "Since that's probably impossible, my only wish is for everyone to sign my scrapbook."
Mabel says: "I'll never forget you guys."
Mabel says: "Wait."

Pacifica says: "I broke a nail wrapping them."
Mabel says: "Pacifica."
Dipper and Mabel each grab a present. Stan claps.
Ford says: "Stanley, I need to talk to you."
Ford says: "I want to go investigate it but I think I might be too old to go it alone."
Stan says: "Are you sayin' you need someone to help you sail around the world in the adventure of a lifetime?"
Ford says: "I don't just want someone to come with me Stanley, I want it to be you."
Ford says: "Will you give me a second chance?"
Stan says: "You think we'll find treasure?"
Stan says: "And babes?"
Ford says: "Heh!"
Ford says: "I'd say there's a high probability."
Ford says: "But, what should we do with the Mystery Shack?"
Stan says: "I think the town's had enough mystery for one lifetime."
Stan says: "Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?"
Stan and Ford start talking unintelligibly. Soos walks up behind them, eating cake, and gasps when he overhears their conversation. Cut to Stan and Ford on the porch with Dipper and Mabel.
Stan says: "Everyone, I have an announcement to make."
Stan says: "Me and my..."
Stan says: "heh!"
Stan says: "..."
Stan says: "nerdy bro over here have some catchin' up to do."
Stan says: "We're gonna be away for a while."
Stan says: "That's why I'm shutting down the Mystery Shack for good."
Soos says: "You shut down your mouth for good!"
Soos says: "Like, this mermaid."
Soos says: "It's not just a dead fish butt sewn to a monkey carcass."
Soos says: "It's a marvelous creature that makes us believe that anything is possible."
Soos says: "You shut down this shack, and you shut down our dreams!"
Soos says: "At least..."
Soos says: "my dreams."
Crowd says: "Aww."
Stan says: "Ladies and gentleman, the Mystery Shack is under new management."
Soos says: "You..."
Soos says: "you mean it, Mr."
Soos says: "Mystery?"
Stan says: "You're Mr."
Stan says: "Mystery now, Soos."
Stan says: "Try not to burn the place down."
Abuelita says: "I'll move in immediately."
The partygoers keep cheering. Cut to the Mystery Shack later that evening. The screen shows the empty attic. Cut to the Pines, Soos, Wendy, Candy, Grenda and Waddles at the bus stop.
Candy says: "Do you really have to go?"
Candy says: "There's still so much we haven't done together."
Mabel says: "Summer's over, Candy."
Mabel says: "It's time for us to grow up."
Dipper says: "But not too much."
Grenda says: "Aaah!"
Grenda says: "I hate my dumb heart for making me feel things."
Grenda says: "Cut."
Grenda says: "It."
Grenda says: "Out."

Stan says: "Ah, it's cold out."
Stan says: "I had to."

Ford says: "Can it, Soos!"
Dipper, Mabel, Candy and Grenda laugh.
Wendy says: "Hey, you mean a lot to me, man."
Dipper says: "You, too."
Wendy says: "Oh, and this."
Wendy says: "Read it the next time you miss Gravity Falls."
A bus pulls up.
Bus Driver says: "Last bus leaving Gravity Falls."
Bus Driver says: "All aboard."
Mabel says: "Guess we've said goodbye to everyone except..."
Mabel says: "Waddles."
Mabel says: "I..."
Mabel says: "I don't know how to explain this but..."
Mabel says: "Mom and Dad won't let me bring a pig home to California so..."
Mabel says: "you have to stay here!"

Mabel says: "Come on."
Mabel says: "I have to go."

Bus Driver says: "You can sit in the front row, pig."
Stan says: "Kids, you knuckleheads were nothin' but a nuisance and I'm glad to be rid of ya."
Mabel says: "We'll miss you too, Grunkle Stan."
Dipper says: "Ready to head into the unknown?"
Mabel says: "Nope."
Mabel says: "Let's do it."
They get on the bus and it drives away. Everyone runs after the bus shouting their farewells.
Mabel says: "Bye!"
Mabel says: "Bye, everybody!"
Mabel says: "We'll miss you."
Dipper says: "Bye!"
Dipper says: "I'll miss you guys, too!"
Ford puts his hand on Stan's shoulder.
Dipper says: "If you've ever taken a road trip through the Pacific Northwest, you've probably seen a bumper sticker for a place called Gravity Falls."
Cut to McGucket walking into the Northwest Manor. He drops his sack and banjo on the ground.
McGucket says: "Well, I've moved in."
Dipper says: "It's not on any maps, and most people have never heard of it."
Dipper says: "Some people think it's a myth."
Dipper says: "But if you're curious, don't wait."
At the Mystery Shack, Soos unveils a statue of Stan. The kids run away screaming. Cut to Ford and Stan on a boat. A giant squid attacks them and Stan punches it. Cut to Dipper and Mabel on the bus and Mabel is asleep.
Dipper says: "Take a trip."
Dipper says: "Find it."
Dipper says: "It's out there somewhere in the woods."
Dipper says: "Waiting."
We then see the scrolling closing credits in the form of Mabel's scrapbook with various pictures such as Waddles playing with the bubble; Dipper and Mabel setting off firecrackers; Mabel doing crazy poses while taking a selfie such as blowing a dandelion and "eating" a sun; Wendy makes a "crazy face" in front of the camera; Tracey and Quattro relaxing under the tent during the rain; Stan trying out the grappling hook while holding Ford; Mabel painting Ford's fingers; Old Man McGucket, his raccoon wife, and his son Tate relaxing in the pool; Quentin Trembley looking yonder at Gravity Falls while sitting on his horse backwards; Mabel, Grenda and Candy doing quick poses in a photo booth; the Pines family watching TV and then fall asleep the next day; some objects in the Mystery Shack like the antique diving helmet and the jar of eyeballs; a tree shows a number of heart carvings with one of them saying Mabel+Gabe, possibly about Mabel's ex-boyfriends; a snack bar in the Mystery Shack where a kid takes one cookie bag; Grenda and Candy during the final days of summer traveling in the yacht with Marius von Fundshauser when Grenda vigorously kisses him; and the final picture before the credits end shows Dipper and Mabel with Waddles sleeping in the bus seat as they reach their hometown of Piedmont, California.
Before the series ends with the last end card, there is a live action shot of Bill's petrified statue hidden in the woods.
