Stan Pines says: "Nice."
Stan Pines says: "And don't forget bug spray!"
Stan Pines says: "It's perfect for spraying in the face of hitchhikers."
Dipper Pines says: "Whoa."
Dipper Pines says: "An RV?"
Dipper Pines says: "Camping gear?"
Dipper Pines says: "Are you running from the law again?"
Soos Ramirez says: "Dude!"
Soos Ramirez says: "It's the ultimate Oregon road trip adventure!"
Stan says: "More like revenge trip."
Stan says: "Every year my tourist trap competitors prank the Mystery Shack."
Stan says: "Last year those hooligans duct taped Soos to the ceiling."
Soos says: "That was a fun 78 hours."
Stan says: "Well, no more!"
Stan says: "This year we're visiting every tourist trap along the Redwood Highway, and I'm gonna prank back every single one."
Grenda says: "Bow wow!"
Grenda says: "Time to let the road dogs bark!"
Candy Chiu says: "That is us."
Candy Chiu says: "We are the road dogs."
Mabel Pines says: "Thanks for letting me bring Candy and Grenda along for our road trip, Grunkle Stan."
Stan says: "The more the merrier."
Stan says: "Just sign these non-disclosure agreements."
Stan says: "None of your parents are lawyers, right?"
Soos says: "What do ya say, dude?"
Soos says: "You comin'?"
Mabel says: "I already went to the trouble of packing all your stuff."
Mabel says: "Even the stuff you kept in that secret box under the bed."
Mabel says: "Whoa."
Mabel says: "What the..."
Mabel says: "?"
Mabel says: "Ugh, what's that?"
Dipper says: "Uh, nothing!"
Dipper says: "Just..."
Dipper says: "Wendy stuff..."
Dipper says: "from old times."
Mabel says: "Ughh."
Soos says: "Ughh."
Mabel says: "Bro, I thought you were finally past all this."
Dipper says: "Ahh, I know, I know!"
Dipper says: "I know she's not interested and I know it's over, but how do you just turn off the way you feel about someone?"
Mabel says: "Two words, Dipper."
Mabel says: "Move."
Mabel says: "On."
Soos says: "Yeah, dude."
Soos says: "And a road trip's the perfect place to meet new people."
Dipper looks at a picture of Wendy, then at the pamphlet. He looks up into the sky and smiles.
Cut to theme song.
The RV bounds across the open road. Stan is driving as Soos pants with his tongue sticking out.
Grenda says: "Man, RVs are amazing."
Grenda says: "I can't believe we're sitting at a table in a moving vehicle!"
Candy says: "Ooh!"
Candy says: "Informational travel pamphlets."
Candy says: "I want to read them all and gain their travel knowledge."
Stan says: "Kid, those useless pamphlets have never helped a single person."
Stan says: "The only wrinkly old travel guide you'll need is me."
Stan says: "Now look alive!"
Stan says: "We're coming up on an attraction run by the most black-hearted proprietor in all of Oregon."
Cut to a sign outside Granny Sweetkin's Yarnball. The RV pulls up next to it and stops.
Stan says: "Don't let the face fool you."
Stan says: "This woman lit my car on fire on two non-consecutive occasions."
Cut to outside the RV. The kids have gotten out and are staring at the yarn ball.
Dipper says: "Whoa."
Mabel says: "Whoa."
Candy says: "Whoa."
Grenda says: "Whoa."
Mabel says: "I'm going in, girls."
Mabel says: "Waaah."
Grenda says: "Yarn!"
A tourist girl walks by Dipper.
Dipper says: "Okay."
Dipper says: "Like Soos said, meet new people."
Dipper says: "So, uh..."
Dipper says: "come here often?"
Unnamed tourist girl says: "No."
Unnamed tourist girl says: "I'm a tourist."
Stan says: "Dipper, hup to!"
Stan says: "This ball a' yarn ain't gonna prank itself."
Dipper takes a piece of the yarn ball from Mabel and ties it to the back of the RV. He sighs.
Stan says: "Something on your mind, kiddo?"
Stan says: "You're thinking about miss cold shoulder over there, huh?"
Dipper says: "Ahh, I'm so embarrassed."
Dipper says: "Look, earlier this summer I ruined my chances with Wendy."
As they talk, Mabel and Grenda pop out of the top of the yarn ball and high-five.
Stan says: "Heh, yeah."
Stan says: "Chances."
Mabel and Grenda begin unraveling the yarn ball behind them.
Dipper says: "And I wanna move on, but I'm terrible at talking to girls."
Dipper says: "The moment I open my mouth around them I unravel like..."
Dipper says: "like..."
Dipper says: "well, I can't think of a perfect metaphor, but you get the gist."
Dipper says: "At this rate, I'm going to grow up to be a sad loner like Toby Determined."
Stan says: "Whoa."
Stan says: "Never say that about yourself."
Stan says: "Lucky for you I'm an expert on women."
Stan says: "Listen to me, kid."
Stan says: "When it comes to girls always be confident."
Stan says: "And be funny, but not too funny."
Stan says: "And be kinda annoying but in a lovable way."
Dipper says: "I don't know, Grunkle Stan."
Dipper says: "This sounds kinda jerky."
Stan says: "Hey, jerky is just a term non-jerks use to bad mouth innocent jerks."
Stan says: "Confidence, comedy, some third word starting with a C."
Stan says: "The three Cs of the Stan Pines dating technique!"
Stan says: "At the next tourist trap, try out my advice on the first girl you see."
Dipper says: "Cool."
Dipper says: "Grunkle Stan, thanks."
Stan says: "Hey, I'm full a good ideas."
Stan says: "Speakin' of which, everyone!"
Stan says: "Now!"
Dipper, Stan, and Soos run into the RV. Mabel, Candy, and Grenda get out of the yarn ball and follow them. The RV speeds away, unraveling the yarn ball completely.
Granny Sweetkin says: "Why, you gall darn son of a no good."
Granny Sweetkin says: "I'll get you, Stan Pines!"
Cut to Upside-Down Town. The RV pulls up and stops.
Stan says: "Ah, Upside-Down Town."
Stan says: "The nausea capital of the state."
Stan says: "Whatever you do, don't use the bathrooms."
The kids put on shoes with Velcro on the bottom, so they can walk on the carpeted ceiling.
Mabel says: "Road dogs!"
Candy says: "Road dogs!"
Grenda says: "Road dogs!"
Mabel says: "Woof, woof, woof!"
Candy says: "Woof, woof, woof!"
Grenda says: "Woof, woof, woof!"
The kids get aligned with the ceiling and walk into the house, laughing.
Grenda says: "Nice!"
Mabel says: "This is so weird!"
Dipper walks in as he notices Emma Sue.
Stan says: "Alright, kid."
Stan says: "This is it."
Stan says: "Be confident."
Dipper says: "Hi, I'm Dipper."
Dipper says: "Crazy place, right?"
Emma Sue says: "Oh, hi."
Emma Sue says: "I'm Emma Sue."
Emma Sue says: "You know, if you pretend we're right side up, it looks like everyone's hair is standing on end."
Dipper says: "Huh."
Dipper says: "Yeah, weird, right?"
Dipper says: "Pretend you're screaming."
Emma Sue says: "Okay."
Emma Sue says: "You gotta take a picture of me, though."
Dipper says: "Let's see about--whoa!"
Dipper says: "You bet I am."
Dipper says: "I'm bad, Emma."
Dipper says: "Kind of a jerk."
Emma Sue's Father says: "Emma, come on!"
Emma Sue's Father says: "We have to get to Canada before your mother gives birth!"
Emma Sue says: "It's a long story."
Dipper says: "Maybe you could tell me sometime."
Emma Sue says: "Here's my email address."
Emma Sue says: "Write me and I'll tell you all about it."
Dipper says: "A girl gave me her email."
Dipper says: "And it wasn't out of pity!"
Dipper says: "Haha!"
Dipper says: "Yes!"
Dipper says: "Hahaha."
Dipper says: "Wooo!"
Grenda says: "Maybe it's the blood pooling in my head, but Dipper seems different."
Candy says: "Yes."
Candy says: "Good different."
Stan says: "Now, Soos!"
Stan and Soos start jumping on the floor, rolling the house and turning it right-side up. The gang runs to the RV and drives away.
Stan says: "Not so upside-down now!"
Civilian says: "What a lovely normal home!"
Upside-Down Town Boss says: "Stan Pines!"
Dipper says: "I can't believe it worked."
Dipper says: "What do I do now?"
Dipper says: "Do I e-mail her?"
Stan says: "No, no, no."
Stan says: "You practice."
Stan says: "The more girls you talk to, the better you get at it."
Dipper says: "Grunkle Stan, these tips are priceless."
Stan says: "And that's just the tip of the advice-berg."
A montage begins. Dipper flirts with girls at Log Land and the Corn Maze as Stan sabotages the attractions. Soos walks into a random area of the Corn Maze as the rest of the gang runs back into the RV.
Stan says: "Everyone on board?"
Mabel says: "Probably."
The RV drives away, leaving Soos behind.
Soos says: "Guys?"
Soos says: "Hello?"
Soos says: "Anyone?"
Soos says: "They'll come back for me."
Cut to Septic Ridge RV Park at night. Dipper and Stan are relaxing in a hot tub.
Stan says: "So then I said to the bouncer, "Where's your ID, ugly?"
Stan says: ""  That's where I got this scar."
Stan says: "That's the Stan Pines method, kid."
Stan says: "Works every time."
Dipper says: "I'm just a little worried, though."
Dipper says: "I mean is it bad to flirt with this many girls at once?"
Dipper says: "I'm just tryin'a get over Wendy."
Dipper says: "I don't wanna hurt anyone's feelings."
Stan says: "Please."
Stan says: "That's the best part 'a flirting on a road trip."
Stan says: "You're not gonna see any of these gals again."
Stan says: "To moving on!"
Screen pans to Mabel, Grenda and Candy sitting at a bonfire next to the RV, eating marshmallows and laughing.
Mabel says: "Okay, it's time for..."
Mabel says: "..."
Grenda says: "..."
Mabel says: "Truth or Dare or Don't!"
Grenda says: "Truth or Dare or Don't!"
Candy says: "I choose..."
Candy says: "don't!"
Grenda says: "Ugh!"
Grenda says: "You always choose don't."
Candy says: "Fine."
Candy says: "Uh, truth."
Mabel says: "Do you..."
Mabel says: "like someone?"
Grenda says: "Uh-oh."
Grenda says: "Someone's blushing."
Candy says: "Okay, maybe just a little."
Candy says: "I don't know for sure."
Candy says: "It just..."
Candy says: "started."
Mabel says: "Tell us!"
Grenda says: "Tell us!"
Mabel says: "Tell us!"
Grenda says: "Tell us!"
Candy says: "Okay."
Candy says: "It begins with a "D" and ends with an "ipper."
Mabel says: "No."
Candy says: "Yes."
Mabel says: "Ready, Grenda?"
Mabel says: "Three."
Mabel says: "Two."
Mabel says: "One."
Stan says: "Man, coyotes sound a lot worse than I remember."
Mabel says: "Candy."
Mabel says: "Candy!"
Mabel says: "All my life dreams are coming true right now."
Mabel says: "My brother."
Mabel says: "My best friend."
Grenda says: "I can't breathe!"
Grenda says: "I'm so excited I can't breathe!"
Candy says: "I never really noticed him before, but he seems different lately."
Candy says: "Less sweaty, and more charming."
Candy says: "But how do I approach him?"
Mabel says: "Don't even worry about that, Can-Can."
Mabel says: "Mabel's got a plan."
Mabel says: "Mabel's got a plan."
Cut to the road. The RV is back on the highway.
Stan says: "Alright, campers."
Stan says: "We got another day 'a breakin' laws and breakin' hearts."
Stan says: "Everything up until now has been a walk in the park compared to our next attraction."
Mabel says: "Is it a walk in the world's biggest park?"
Stan says: "Eh, sort of."
Stan says: "There she is, kids."
Stan says: "Mystery Mountain."
Stan says: "Five times the size of the Mystery Shack, and what's worse: she has real attractions."
Candy says: "Oh!"
Candy says: "I have read about this place."
Candy says: "It has sky tram."
Candy says: "And a mummy museum."
Candy says: "And sightings of half human, half spider creatures."
Stan says: "Even their made up legends are better than ours."
Stan says: "Today, the mountain falls."
Mabel says: "Question."
Mabel says: "The back seat makes me car sick."
Mabel says: "Can I sit up front today?"
Grenda says: "Also question."
Grenda says: "I'm the size of two people."
Grenda says: "Can I have a whole seat to myself?"
Stan says: "Eh, I don't know, sure."
Dipper says: "But wait!"
Candy says: "Candy Chiu!"
Candy says: "6th grade!"
Dipper says: "Whoa!"
Dipper says: "Hey."
Dipper and Candy awkwardly sit in silence. After a few seconds, Candy moves closer to Dipper.
Dipper says: "You're sitting close."
Candy says: "So, Dipper."
Candy says: "I was wondering, would you maybe want to walk around the Mystery Mountain with me today?"
Dipper says: "Ssssure, I mean, wasn't that already the plan?"
Candy says: "I mean, just us."
Candy says: "You and me."
Candy says: "Candy and Dipper."
Dipper looks shocked as Stan slams the brakes on the car, coming to a stop in front of the Mystery Mountain entrance. Cut to Stan outside the RV.
Stan says: "Alright, road dogs!"
Stan says: "I got five bucks for whoever can tip the big blue ox!"
Stan says: "Go, go, go!"
Stan says: "Hey, what's up with the mopey mug, kid?"
Dipper says: "Stan!"
Dipper says: "You gotta help me!"
Dipper says: "Everything you taught me worked too well!"
Dipper says: "I think Candy just asked me out on a date!"
Stan says: "He-hey!"
Stan says: "Look at this little champion!"
Dipper says: "What?"
Dipper says: "No!"
Dipper says: "I-I mean, Candy's great, she's sweet and she's smart, but I've never thought of her like that!"
Dipper says: "Th-th-this is all moving way too fast."
Dipper says: "Okay."
Dipper says: "I just need to be honest with her and tell her I-I'm not ready for all this."
Stan says: "Speaking of which..."
Darlene grins at Stan.
Dipper says: "But I don't wanna lead her on!"
Stan says: "Ah ah ah!"
Stan says: "Watch and learn."
Stan says: "Can I borrow yours?"
Darlene says: "You are a riot!"
Darlene says: "What brings you here?"
Darlene says: "We don't normally get men this handsome around these parts."
Stan says: "Heheh."
Stan says: "Well,  Darlene, between you and me, what I'm doing here is a little secret."
Darlene says: "Oh, you seem like a man with secrets."
Dipper says: "Ugh."
Darlene says: "You know, I'm going on a break."
Darlene says: "You wanna take the sky tram up to Widow's Peak?"
Stan says: "Take my advice or don't, but clearly I know what I'm doing."
Darlene says: "Oh, fancy!"
Cut to Mabel and Grenda watching from the bushes as Candy and Dipper enter Mummy Town U.S.A.
Mabel says: "Oh!"
Mabel says: "I can't believe this is happening."
Mabel says: "A real date!"
Mabel says: "I wonder what they'll name the baby."
Grenda says: "If I had a baby, I would name it Grenda 2: The Sequel!"
Mabel says: "You would make such a good mother."
Cut to inside Mummy Town U.S.A. Dipper and Candy are sitting on a bench. A banner above them reads "NEW MUMMIES DAILY".
Candy says: "This place is so enchanting."
Dipper says: "Sort of confused by the phrase "New Mummies Daily," though."
Dipper says: "I mean, how does that even work?"
Candy says: "This mountain is full of mysteries."
Candy says: "Like, why is my head falling on your shoulder?"
Candy says: "Beeyooop."
Dipper says: "Uh, yep!"
Dipper says: "This is what I want!"
Dipper says: "This is all part of the plan and stuff."
Corn Maze Girl says: "Oh, Dipper!"
Corn Maze Girl says: "Hey!"
Dipper says: "Corn Maze Girl!"
Corn Maze Girl says: "I was wondering when you'd call."
Candy says: "Dipper, who is this?"
Dipper says: "Nobody!"
Emma Sue says: "Dipper!"
Emma Sue says: "I didn't recognize you right-side up."
Emma Sue says: "You'll never guess where my mom gave birth."
Emma Sue says: "Hey, who are these girls?"
Log Land Girl says: "Dipper?"
Log Land Girl says: "Why haven't you called?"
Log Land Girl says: "Did our romantic log ride mean nothing to you?"
Candy says: "I can't believe it."
Candy says: "You agreed to go on a date with me and you were seeing all these other girls?"
Corn Maze Girl says: "Well, answer us."
Corn Maze Girl says: "Which one of us do you like?"
Dipper says: "I..."
Emma Sue, Log Land Girl, and Corn Maze Girl walk away in disgust.
Log Land Girl says: "Unbelievable."
Emma Sue says: "So gross."
Corn Maze Girl says: "What a jerk."
Candy says: "Dipper Pines."
Dipper says: "Uh, Candy, wait!"
Dipper says: "Ugh, I messed everything up."
Dipper says: "I gotta find Stan!"
Dipper says: "He'll know what to do!"
Stan and Darlene move to sit at a bench near the Giant Spider Forest.
Darlene says: "Oh, are you sure you wanna go this deep into the forest?"
Darlene says: "It's so scaaary."
Stan says: "Heh, don't worry, toots."
Stan says: "That spider people stuff is just an urban legend."
Stan says: "I can't believe people fall for it."
Darlene says: "You're so brave."
Stan says: "What can I say?"
Stan says: "I'm a real catch."
Darlene says: "Yes."
Darlene says: "The catch of the day."
The view pans up as Darlene changes in size, stopping on a giant statue of a spider.
Cut back to the Mystery Mountain entrance. Dipper runs to the information stand.
Dipper says: "Uh, have you seen an old guy around here?"
Dipper says: "Uh, big ears, orange nose, a real know-it-all?"
Fire Retardant Raccoon says: "Ah, ah, ah!"
Fire Retardant Raccoon says: "Flame Retardant Raccoon says: don't hug forest fires."
Dipper says: "Ughhh."
Dipper says: "Grunkle Stan?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Stan says: "Heeey, buddy boy."
Stan says: "So remember how we were talking about my technique?"
Stan says: "Well, sometimes it leads to unexpected consequences."
Dipper says: "Yeah, you can say that again."
Dipper says: "Where are you?"
Stan says: "The good news is, I've solved the mystery of where Oregon's mummies come from."
Stan says: "The bad news is..."
Cuts to Stan in a cave, trapped in spider silk and hanging from the ceiling right-side up. He has the walkie-talkie lodged in-between his shoulder and his head.
Stan says: "..."
Stan says: "I'm about to become one."
Stan says: "Turns out Darlene is one of those spider people."
Stan says: "But beyond that, the date's been okay."
Cut back to the Mystery Mountain entrance.
Dipper says: "Wait, wait, wait."
Dipper says: "Darlene's a spider person?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Dipper says: "How is that possible?"
Stan says: "I don't know."
Stan says: "One minute we're having the perfect date, and the next minute she's growing extra legs and encasing me in webbing."
Stan says: "Women, right?"
Dipper says: "You couldn't tell she was a spider?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Stan says: "I was blinded by flattery!"
Stan says: "Also, this acid she spit in my face."
Stan says: "I'm up the mountain at Widow's Peak."
Dipper says: "Alright, I'm gonna find you."
Dipper says: "Stay put!"
Stan says: "..."
Stan says: "You got it."
Darlene shoots a string of webbing at Stan's walkie-talkie, bringing it to her. She walks toward Stan, half-spider in appearance.
Darlene says: "Ah, aaaah!"
Darlene says: "Trying to escape?"
Stan says: "You tricked me!"
Stan says: "I'm 80% certain you don't really love me at all!"
Darlene says: "Hah!"
Darlene says: "Men will fall for anything."
Darlene says: "You so funny, great story, I love a man with shoulder hair!"
Stan says: "You--you didn't mean it about my shoulder hair?!"
Stan says: "!"
Darlene says: "I'm the master pickup artist here."
Darlene says: "Sorry, toots!"
Darlene says: "This time, you're getting used for your body!"
Darlene says: "Which, to my weird species, is food."
Darlene says: "Allow me to slip into something more horrifying."
Darlene uses her legs to pull her mouth open and over the rest of her skin, folding up her human appearance and revealing the true spider underneath.
Darlene says: "I wonder what beverage pairs well with a vintage 70-something year old man?"
Stan says: "Come on, Dipper, where are you?"
Cut to Mabel, Candy, and Grenda sitting at the Stump Bench.
Candy says: "I feel like such a fool."
Candy says: "I should have known to guard my heart in a cage of ice."
Grenda says: "There, there!"
Grenda says: "Let my calming voice soothe you!"
Candy says: "It is helping."
Dipper says: "Girls!"
Dipper says: "There you are."
Mabel says: "Betrayer!"
Candy says: "Oh, you."
Candy says: "What do you want?"
Dipper says: "I need your help."
Candy says: "With what, some sick jealousy trap?"
Mabel says: "Yeah, sing it, Candy!"
Grenda says: "Testify!"
Dipper says: "Look, I'm so sorry about everything."
Dipper says: "But Stan's in trouble!"
Dipper says: "You can totally kill me later, but right now he needs us."
Dipper says: "I'll explain on the way."
The kids walk up the trail, with Old Reliable going off in the background. They go past the Trambience as well. Cut to back in the cave.
Darlene says: "Doo, do-doo, doo..."
Stan says: "Please."
Stan says: "I don't know if you're really up there or not, but if you are, please save me, Paul Bunyan!"
Grenda says: "Mr."
Grenda says: "Pines!"
Stan says: "Whoa, did that really work?"
Stan says: "Quick!"
Stan says: "Before the rest of the venom sets in!"
The kids tear the webbing off of Stan. They all run out of the cave, with Darlene at the entrance.
Darlene says: "No!"
Darlene says: "Where are you?"
Candy says: "The sky tram!"
Candy says: "Everybody on!"
Candy says: "I have a plan!"
The gang hops onto one of the trams on the Trambience.
Mabel says: "Haha, yes!"
Grenda says: "Perfect!"
Stan says: "Ride like the wind, sky tram!"
The tram is moving very slowly. A voice plays inside the tram.
Recording says: "Welcome to Trambience, the world's slowest treetop tram ride."
Recording says: "Enjoy the sights at 0."
Recording says: "1 miles per hour."
Dipper says: "Ugh, can't this thing go any faster?"
Recording says: "No it can't."
Recording says: "This is Trambience."
Darlene climbs up a pole holding the trams and looks for Stan's tram. She jumps down on several trams as she searches for it.
Recording says: "Enjoying the view?"
Recording says: "Take a picture!"
Darlene's head appears in the window, causing everyone to panic. She begins coating the tram in webbing.
Stan says: "We're doomed!"
Dipper says: "We're all gonna die!"
Dipper says: "Candy, wait!"
Dipper says: "Don't pull that lever!"
Stan says: "Kid, are you crazy?!"
Stan says: "!"
Candy says: "Now!"
The tram is disconnected from the rail, sending it and Darlene down to the ground. An Old Reliable goes off, pushing the tram into the air. It bounces and rolls across Mystery Mountain, barreling through the ticket booth below the Paul Bunyan statue. Darlene is severed from the webbing and lies beneath the statue as its foot crashes down on her. She struggles to break free.
Darlene says: "My only weakness!"
Darlene says: "A giant boot!"
Darlene says: "A giant newspaper or a giant cup would've also been pretty bad."
The door to the tram is pushed open. The gang stumbles out.
Recording says: "Thank you for riding Trambience sky tram!"
Recording says: "Tell your friends it was a boring, boring ride."
Stan says: "Kid, that was ingenious!"
Stan says: "How'd you know that would work?"
Candy says: "Useless travel pamphlets."
Darlene says: "I'm sorry."
Darlene says: "I dunno what came over me."
Darlene says: "You'll let me out, right?"
Stan says: "What?!"
Stan says: "!"
Stan says: "After all that?"
Stan says: "Seriously, do I look like an amnesiac?"
Darlene says: "You're so funny."
Darlene says: "Have you ever considered becoming a comedian?"
Stan says: "You know, I actually have."
Stan says: "Comedy is too subtle these days."
Stan says: "My style involves more over-sized props."
The kids pull Stan away from Darlene as she turns back into a spider and reaches out to bite him.
Stan says: "Oh, yeah."
Stan says: "Right."
Darlene says: "You win this round, Stan!"
Darlene says: "But mark my words, as long as there's men like you out there, with their dumb one-liners and pickup moves, I'll never run out of prey!"
Stan says: "Aah!"
Stan says: "Get the car, get the car!"
The gang runs into the RV and drives away from Mystery Mountain. They get ready to go back to the Mystery Shack.
Stan says: "Alright, kid."
Stan says: "I gotta admit something."
Stan says: "I'm no expert on women."
Stan says: "Truth is, I've been divorced once, and slapped more times than I can remember."
Stan says: "Confidence can buy you a lot, but at the end of the day, pickup artists tend to get our heads bitten off."
Stan says: "When it comes to women, I'm a failure."
Dipper says: "Hey."
Candy says: "It's okay, Dipper."
Candy says: "The open road makes people do crazy things."
Candy says: "Plus, after seeing you flee that spider like a baby, I kind of lost interest."
Dipper says: "Yep!"
Dipper says: "Yep."
Dipper says: "I deserve that."
The RV enters Gravity Falls. The kids cheer.
Dipper says: "I still feel a little bad about wrecking those tourist traps."
Stan says: "Ah, come on."
Stan says: "Everyone loves my pranks!"
Stan says: "And the best part is, I never have to face any consequen--SWEET LORD!"
Stan stops the RV and gets out to see the owners of the tourist traps he pranked ruining the Mystery Shack.
Stan says: "Aw, come on!"
A Corn Maze worker runs up and smashes one of the RV's headlights with a baseball bat.
Corn Maze Worker says: "That's what you get!"
Corn Maze Worker says: "That's what you get!"
Stan says: "I don't understand."
Stan says: "I completely don't deserve this."
Dipper says: "Oh, man."
Dipper says: "Are we gonna have to help clean this up?"
Mabel says: "Nah, I'm sure Soos will take care of it."
Mabel says: "Where is Soos, anyway?"
Credits says: "Soos is still in the Corn Maze."
Soos says: "Okay, Soos."
Soos says: "Remember what your grandma taught you."
Soos says: "When you get lost, stay exactly where you are, and don't move."
Soos says: "You know, I would make a really good scarecrow."
End.
