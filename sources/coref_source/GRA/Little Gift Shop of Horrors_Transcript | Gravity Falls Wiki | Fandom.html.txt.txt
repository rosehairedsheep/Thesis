Open to shot of the Mystery Shack at night. A person we see the scene through its point of view walks up to the door. Stan answers it.
Stan Pines says: "Well, hello there, traveler."
Stan Pines says: "I see your car broke down on this lonesome country road."
Stan Pines says: "A place so remote, that NO ONE CAN HEAR YOUR SCREAMS!"
Stan says: "Pretend I didn't say that."
Stan says: "Come in, come in, but be warned: if you enter, you may be subjected to my tales..."
Stan says: "TALES DESIGNED TO SELL MY MERCHANDISE!"
Red bolded text appears, which reads "TALES DESIGNED TO SELL MY MERCHANDISE.".

Stan says: "We got a wet blanket for sale!"
Cut to Toby Determined at the wet blanket booth.
Toby Determined says: "I can't survive in this market..."
Cut to Mystery Shack. Stan is in the bathroom.
Stan says: "Hah!"
Stan says: "Curse?"
Stan says: "Yeah, right."
Mabel says: "NO HANDS!"
Mabel says: "GRUNKLE STAN!"
Mabel says: "WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HANDS??"
Stan says: "So I might have got cursed a little."
Stan says: "But the watch looks nice, right?"
Hand Witch says: "Foolish man!"
Hand Witch says: "Thieving hands find wicked face!"
Hand Witch says: "You must return what isn't yours..."
Stan says: "That's better."
Dipper says: "I told you, Grunkle Stan."
Dipper says: "You gotta give that watch back and apologize."
Stan says: "What?"
Stan says: "That old crone should apologize to me for denying my right to buy cheap junk."
Stan says: "I don't need hands."
Stan says: "I've got self-respect!"

Cut to Stan at bowling alley.
Cut to Stan at a market.

Stan says: "No, Jimmy, wait, not today!"
Stan says: "NOT TODAAAY!"
Stan says: "Let's find that witch."
Cut to the family at a cave.
Mabel says: "According to the Swap Meet pamphlet, the Hand Witch lives in a horrible Hand Witch lair, on Hand Witch Mountain."
Stan says: "Stop saying Hand Witch."
They enter the cave. A hand taps Mabel.
Mabel says: "Grunkle Stan, did you just tap my shoulder?"
Stan says: "Kid, I can't tap anything."
Hands poke Dipper.
Dipper says: "Guys, can you stop tapping both my shoulders?"
Hands attack them.
Stan says: "Hands!"
Stan says: "Lots of hands!"
Hands are slapping Stan.
Hand Witch says: "You guys..."
Hand Witch says: "you guys get me."
Stan says: "Alright, you horrible wench."
Stan says: "You got me."
Stan says: "Stealing is wrong, et cetera."
Stan says: "Take it."
Stan says: "Now can I have my hands back?"
Stan says: "I have a certain gesture I'd like to share with you."
Hand Witch says: "Alas, your hands cannot be gotten so easily."
Hand Witch says: "The spirits say..."
Hand Witch says: "ummm..."
Hand Witch says: "that the curse can only be broken, by a kissss..."
Dipper says: "What?"
Mabel says: "What?"
Stan says: "What?"
Hand Witch says: "A KISS ON THE LIIIIPPSS!!!"
Stan says: "What?"
Stan says: "Forget it!"
Stan says: "I'm not kissing any of that mess!"
Stan says: "I don't need my hands that bad!"
Dipper says: "Yeah, you're just making stuff up now."
Stan says: "Let's go, kids."
Hand Witch says: "NO, WAIT DON'T GO!"
Hand Witch says: "Ehh- you're right, you're right."
Hand Witch says: "I-I-I was just making all of that stuff up."
Hand Witch says: "I-I was just trying to get something going, you know?"
Hand Witch says: "It's so hard to meet people these days..."
Dipper says: "So this was all just a ploy to get a date?"
Hand Witch says: "I'M DESPERATE, OKAY?"
Hand Witch says: "But every time I bring someone back here without keeping their hands hostage, they just run away."
Stan says: "Well, yeah, look at this horror show!"
Stan says: "It's creepy even for a cave."
Mabel says: "You just need to redecorate!"
Mabel says: "For example:  A Handalabra!"
Hand Witch says: "OOOH!"
Hand Witch says: "THE HAND WITCH LIKES."
Mabel says: "Then watch me work."
Mabel says: "HOME MAKEOVER!"
Montage of "home makeover.".
Mabel says: "Redecorate!"
Mabel says: "Brand new you!"
Mabel says: "Shake it around!"
Mabel says: "You gotta do it to make it work!"
Mabel says: "Okay, time to take a look at your fantastic new cave."
Mabel says: "Men will definitely tolerate you, now."
Mabel says: "And I left a book of pick up lines on the end table."
Hand Witch says: "AAAAAGH!"
Hand Witch says: "OH MY GOODNESS, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS THE SAME CAVE, OH MY GOODNESS."

Stan says: "Nope."
Stan says: "Never."
Stan says: "Well."
Stan says: "I learned nothing."
Hand Witch says: "Back to my crippling loneliness."
Man says: "Hey."
Man says: "I'm lost in these mountains."
Man says: "Can I crash here for the night?"
Hand Witch says: "Please."
Hand Witch says: "Come in."
Hand Witch says: "Girl, are those space pants?"
Hand Witch says: "Because your butt looks out of this world!"
Man says: "Wow."
Man says: "Thanks for noticing."
Hand Witch says: "Yes!"
We are back in the Mystery Shack at night.
Stan says: "Alright, I get it."
Stan says: "You don't want the hand."
The hand crawls around before leaving the room.
Stan says: "You're a savvy customer."
Stan says: "But perhaps you'd be interested in buying..."
Stan says: "This magic pig!"
Stan says: "Sure, he doesn't look magic, but there's a very interesting story I'm about to make up about him."
Stan says: "And it's called: "ABACONINGS!"
Abaconings title card appears. Cut to Dipper in the attic.

Mabel says: "This is May May and THE HOGG!"
Mabel says: "Coming at you on the AM!"
Waddles says: "EEE!"
Mabel says: "Woah!"
Mabel says: "Not sure we can say that on the air!"
Mabel says: "Don't touch that dial, truckers!"
Mabel says: "Cause the Hogg just ate it."
Dipper says: "Mabel, could you knock it off?"
Dipper says: "I'm trying to solve this intelligence puzzle but it seems impossible."
Mabel says: "Maybe you're just not smart enough."
Dipper says: "..."
Dipper says: "We'll see about that."
Dipper says: "Tomorrow, I own you!"
The next morning says: "Dipper:  Ha-ha!"
The next morning says: "I feel smarter already!"
The next morning says: "The digits of pi are three point one..."
The next morning says: "uh..."
Waddles says: "Four, one, five, nine, two, six, et cetera."
Dipper says: "What?"
Dipper says: "Who said that?"
Dipper says: "Mabel?"
Mabel says: "Huh!"
Mabel says: "Dipper, look!"
Waddles says: "Greetings, friends, it is I, Waddles, the pig."
Dipper says: "What?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Mabel says: "Waddles!"
Mabel says: "What happened to you?"
Mabel says: "Have you been possessed by the spirit of a nerd!"
Mabel says: "?"
Waddles says: "Forgive me."
Waddles says: "My pig arms are cute and useless."
Dipper says: "The brain goop!"
Dipper says: "You ate it and built all this, didn't you?"
Mabel says: "THIS ISN'T RIGHT!"
Mabel says: "THE PIG GOES OINK!"
Mabel says: "THE PIG GOES OINK!!!"
Waddles says: "Now the pig goes wherever he can shine the light of knowledge into the darkness of ignorance."
Dipper says: "Woah!"
Dipper says: "What-the-heck-ahedron!"
Dipper says: "How did you do that?"
Waddles says: "I can teach you, Dipper."
Waddles says: "I can teach you many things."
Dipper says: "Man, I am loving this new Waddles."
Mabel says: "Yeah!"
Mabel says: "He's uh."
Mabel says: "He's definitely, uh, different."
Dipper says: "Dude, that rocket cart is amazing."
Dipper says: "You and me should go invent stuff!"
Mabel says: "Uh, Waddles!"
Mabel says: "Don't you want to stay up here and record some morning pranks with me?"
Dipper says: "Mabel, this pig's got a gift."
Dipper says: "He needs to share it with the world!"
Waddles says: "I'm sorry, Mabel."
Waddles says: "There is more to life than making fart noises, and laughing at those fart noises."
Waddles says: "I see that now."
Mabel says: "Right."
Mabel says: "Yeah."
Mabel says: "You guys."
Mabel says: "Just go on without me."
Cut to outside. Grenda's kite is stuck in a tree.
Grenda says: "Oh, my kite got stuck in a tree."
Grenda says: "I HATE EVERYTHING!"
Dipper says: "I bet we could be of service."
Grenda says: "AN AFFRONT AGAINST NATURE!"
Waddles says: "Ha!"
Waddles says: "Forget kites!"
Waddles says: "Here."
Waddles says: "Take this rocket pack I invented and explore the heavens yourself."
Grenda says: "Forget that!"
Grenda says: "Grenda's gonna look at boys through skylights."
Grenda says: "I RULE THE SKIES."
Dipper says: "Dude, that rocket pack we made is amazing."
Waddles says: "Don't forget the laser gun I made for Candy."
Candy Chiu says: "Death to my enemies!"
Mabel says: "What did that nasty goop do to you?"
Mabel says: "You're not happier like this, are you?"
Dipper says: "This is your greatest invention yet!"
Dipper says: "It could solve every problem of mankind!"
Waddles says: "And bring me potatoes."
Waddles says: "Delicious potatoes."
The machine puts a potato in his mouth.
Waddles says: "Yummy yummy, for my fat little pig tummy."
Mabel says: "What the heck is going on here?"
Waddles says: "Mabel, you are just in time to behold our greatest achievement."
Waddles says: "The "Smarticle Accelerator"."
Dipper says: "Solving that brain puzzle was just the tip of the iceberg, With this, Waddles will be able to solve all the greatest puzzles of the UNIVERSE."
Dipper says: "Soon, your pig is gonna be famous!"
Dipper says: "Meeting with scientists, presidents..."
Dipper says: "I wonder if I could teach him to wear pants."
Mabel says: "The whole world?"
Mabel says: "But when will you have time for us?"
Mabel says: "I'm your best friend."
Waddles says: "I'm still your friend, Mabel, but I'm helping people now."
Mabel says: "But what about helping me?"
Mabel says: "Do you really want to spend your whole life in meetings with dumb smart guys?"
Mabel says: "This brain junk has made you forget who you are."
Mabel says: "Don't you remember..."
Mabel says: "us?"
Dipper says: "Waddles, Waddles, don't!"
Dipper says: "WAIT!"
Waddles says: "I'm sorry, Dipper."
Waddles says: "In my last eight seconds of consciousness I want you to know that science is a horizon to search for, not a prize to hold in your hand."
Waddles says: "Also, I miss getting my tummy tickled."
Mabel says: "Oh, Waddles!"
The Smarticle Accelerator falls down.
Dipper says: "No!"
Dipper says: "Our invention!"
Mabel says: "I know what'll make you feel better: a simple hug from a simple pig."
Dipper says: "Yeah, guess so."
Dipper says: "Good pig."
Dipper says: "Uggh."
Cut back to Stan in the Mystery Shack.
Stan says: "You know what, you're right."
Stan says: "Don't buy the pig."
Stan says: "In fact, I'm probably better off leaving him with my niece."
An arrow with a suction cup on the end sticks to his fez.
Stan says: "No shooting in the house, sweetie!"
Stan says: "But perhaps I can interest you in something else."
Cinnamon says: "You did it, Shimmery Twinkleheart!"
Shimmery Twinkleheart says: "No, you did it, Cinnamon..."
Mabel says: "..."
Shimmery Twinkleheart says: "..."
Mabel says: "because you believed in yourself."
Shimmery Twinkleheart says: "because you believed in yourself."
Stan says: "Uhhh..."
Soos says: "Uhhh..."
Dipper says: "Everything about this is bad."
Stan says: "Well, that just put me 90 minutes closer to death."
Stan says: "It's time you kids learned to watch the classics from my day."
Mabel says: "Ooo, old people movies."
Mabel says: "Get ready for references we don't understand, and words we can't repeat."
The Voyages of Loinclothiclese begins.
Loinclothiclese says: "You're no match for Loinclothiclese!"
Loinclothiclese says: "I've come for the golden pants!"
Dipper says: "Oh no."
Dipper says: "Mabel!"
Stan says: "Well."
Stan says: "Your sister's broken."
Dipper says: "Oh, Grunkle Stan, I should have told you before."
Dipper says: "Mabel has a childhood terror of old-timey stop-motion animation."
Dipper says: "It's like her number one fear since we were kids."
Stan says: "Heh heh."
Stan says: "Come on, those hogey old things?"
Stan says: "How scared could she be?"
Cut to Mabel hiding in the laundry basket in the attic.
Mabel says: "The cyclops!"
Mabel says: "His face is made of nightmares!"
Stan says: "Kid, it's just a movie, it can't hurt you!"
Mabel says: "No talking."
Mabel says: "They wait for you to talk and then crawl inside your mouth!"
Dipper says: "Why did you have to show her that tape?"
Stan says: "There's got to be a way to get her over this!"
Stan says: "Huh..."
Cut to everyone at the gates of Harry Claymore's workplace. Mabel is still in the laundry basket.
Stan says: "Alright."
Stan says: "If we can just get the director to show her the models are fake, maybe she'll finally calm down."
Soos Ramirez says: "I don't know, dude."
Soos Ramirez says: "According to the Internet, special effects genius Harry Claymore is some kind of recluse."
Stan says: "The man wants his privacy."
Stan says: "I can respect that."
Stan says: "Well, everyone over the fence."
Everyone is in the yard, heading to the house.
Stan says: "You see, Mabel, those monsters are just clay models moved around one frame at a time, by an antisocial shut-in."
Soos says: "Those people are called animators."
Dipper says: "Hello?"
Dipper says: "Mr."
Dipper says: "Claymore?"
Stan says: "We wanna get a look at your figurines!"
Soos says: "We're not paparazzi!"
Dipper says: "Aha!"
Dipper says: "See, Mabel?"
Dipper says: "It's all just special effects."
Dipper says: "You can come out."
Mabel says: "NO."
Stan says: "Kid, listen to me."
Soos says: "Let's escape by standing still!"
Soos says: "It didn't work!"
The cyclops grabs Stan and skeletons pop out of the ground.
Mabel says: "Ahh!"
Dipper says: "Ah!"
Dipper says: "How is this happening?"
Dipper says: "What do they want?"
Harry Claymore says: "I'm afraid they want you."
Stan says: "Harry Claymore!"
Stan says: "Master of special effects!"
Stan says: "Circa-1970's-something."
Harry Claymore says: "Alas, my effects are more special than you know."
Dipper says: "What?"
Dipper says: "But how are these things real?"
Dipper says: "What about stop motion?"
Harry says: "What?"
Harry says: "You really believe someone moves these figures one frame at a time?"
Harry says: "I'm not a masochist!"
Harry says: "I use black magic to make them animate themselves."
Harry says: "It was great at first, but one day..."
Flashback says: "Cyclops:  No!"
Flashback says: "Where's the heart?"
Harry says: "Now that they were out of work, they went mad and enslaved me!"
Harry says: "And now they will turn you into unholy beasts clay to join in their mischeif!"
Soos says: "Huh, Mr."
Soos says: "Pines."
Soos says: "At least you finally get to work with your favorite director."
Soos says: "And by work, I mean suffocate inside a big wad of clay!"
More clay is stuffed on Soos. The three call out for help. Mabel sees the whole thing.
Mabel says: "Oh, what do I do?"
Mabel says: "How can I defeat those monstrosities?"
Mabel says: "Hey, skeleton dorks!"
Mabel says: "IT'S CLAYBACK TIME!!"
The Cyclops is remade into Shimmery Twinkleheart.
Soos says: "Dude, you conquered your fear!"
Shimmery Twinkleheart says: "That's right."
Mabel says: "JAM, IT, TWINKLEHEART!"
Mabel says: "Just start pounding those skeletons!"
Shimmery Twinkleheart says: "Hoo hoo hoo..."
Dipper says: "Mabel, you did it!"
Dipper says: "So you're not scared anymore?"
Stan says: "Kid, I'm sorry I doubted you."
Stan says: "."
Stan says: "You were right!"
Stan says: "Stop-motion is pure evil."
We see the stop-motion monsters fighting in shadow. Shimmery Twinkleheart punches several skeletons.
Soos says: "And probably really expensive."
Harry Claymore says: "Incredibly expensive."
Soos says: "This is an impressive fight, though."
Soos says: "I'm glad I'm facing towards it."
A scorpion with the head of medusa attacks Shimmery Twinkleheart and they melt into the mass of clay. Unicorns rain from the ceiling and fall into it.
All says: "Yaaaaayyyyy!!"
Harry Claymore says: "That was the best part!"
Cut back to the Mystery Shack. Stan, Dipper, and Mabel are watching "Loiclothiclese in the creature with an unreasonable amount of heads.".
Dipper says: "Well, I think today we learned that you can remold your fears."
Mabel says: "I'm just glad that none of us got turned into clay."
Soos says: "Holy Toledo!"
Stan says: "You should have bought my merch when you had the chance, buddy."
Stan says: "But that's okay."
Stan says: "I'll have something new for sale very soon."
Stan says: "Heh heh heh heh..."
Cut to the Mystery Shack at day. The person is in a glass case that says "THE CHEAPSKATE" on the front.
Stan says: "And here we have our latest attraction: the legendary Cheapskate."
Girl says: "I saw it blinking."
Stan says: "Heh!"
Stan says: "Just an optical illusion."
Stan says: "Come along, everyone."
Stan says: "Step right up..."
Stan says: "AHAHAHA!"
Stan says: "That's right, I'm a jerk!"
Epilogue. Mabel is standing in front of the case and Dipper is reading on the Gift Shop counter.
Mabel says: "Hey, I wanted to be Xs!"
Mabel says: "Let me be Xs."
Dipper says: "Trust me, just let her be Xs."
Mabel says: "Yaaay!"
Mabel says: "Actually, I'm sorry, I changed my mind; I want to be Os."
Mabel says: "Okay, you're gooonna hate me right now, but could Xs be a possibility?"
Traveler says: "HELP ME: Mabel: I don't think you're playing this right."
