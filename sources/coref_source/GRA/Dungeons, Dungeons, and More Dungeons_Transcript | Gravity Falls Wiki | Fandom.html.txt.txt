Stan says: "Do yourself a favor and stay away from him, you hear me?"
Dipper says: "But, Grunkle Stan, all summer long I've wanted to know who the author of the journal was."
Dipper says: "Now the guy lives in our basement and I can't even talk to him."
Stan says: "Don't worry about what's in the basement."
Stan says: "You belong up here with me and Mabel."
Mabel says: "Yeah!"

Dipper says: "You wanna play it with me?"
Mabel says: "Well, I do like unicorns, and that hot elf looks promising."
Mabel says: "How do you play?"
Dipper says: "The rules are simple."
Dipper says: "First, you roll a 38-sided die to determine the level of each player's statistical analysis poweroid."
Dipper says: "These orbs relate directly to the amount of quadrants that your team has dominion over, which is inverse to the anti-quadrants in your quadrant satchel."
Mabel says: "And then we ride unicorns?"
Dipper says: "Yes!"
Dipper says: "And no."
Dipper says: "First, we make a graph."
Mabel says: "This is like Homework: The Game."

Dipper says: "Yes!"
Dipper says: "It is!"
Dipper says: "You wanna play with me, Grunkle Stan?"
Stan says: "Ha!"
Stan says: "Look, kid, I prefer to do my dice rolling in Vegas."
Stan says: "Besides, only a game designed by nerds would have "charisma" as a fantasy power."
Stan says: "Heh."
Stan says: "Check this out:  When facing yon adversaries, shield thyself, under an elfin buttress."
Mabel says: "Haha, say it again!"
Stan says: "Buttress."
Dipper says: "Hey!"
Dipper says: "Laugh all you want."
Dipper says: "You guys just aren't smart enough to understand it."

Ford says: "My work is far too dangerous for a single living soul to spend even one second i- wait!"
Ford says: "Is that a 38-sided die from Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons?!"
Ford says: "!"
Dipper says: "Yeah!"
Dipper says: "Y-you know that game?"
Ford says: "With pen and paper, shield and sword..."
Dipper says: "Our quest shall be our sweet reward!"
Ford says: "Our quest shall be our sweet reward!"
Ford says: "This is my favorite game in the whole multiverse!"
Ford says: "I can't believe they still make it!"
Dipper says: "They do!"
Dipper says: "And I've been looking all day for someone to play it with me!"
Ford says: "My boy, do you know what this means?"
Ford says: "We must stop everything I've been working on at once..."
Ford says: "and PLAY!"
Ford says: "That's..."
Ford says: "going to leave a mark."

Dipper says: "Yes!"
Dipper says: "Uh!"
Dipper says: "In your face, you cardboard wizard!"
Ford says: "Hm."
Ford says: "The old boy looks a bit different than he did back in my day."
Dipper says: "Mmm, yeah, they change the art every few years."
Dipper says: "Thankfully you missed the period when the creators of the game tried to make it "cooler."
Cut to an old commercial. Some teens spray paint over an advertisement for Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons.

Dipper says: "Must have been dark times, those 90's."
Ford says: "Yeesh."
Ford says: "Sounds like a good time to be stuck between dimensions."
Dipper says: "Great uncle Ford, I've been meaning to ask you: where were you before you came out of that machine, and what have you been doing down here?"
Dipper says: "Are you working on something behind that curtain?"
Ford says: "Dipper, it's best if you and the family stay away from that subject."
Ford says: "Honestly, I'm not sure any of you could handle the real answer."
Ford says: "Ah-ah!"
Ford says: "But I can show you something I brought back with me:  An infinity-sided die."
Dipper says: "Woah..."
Dipper says: "that's so cool."
Dipper says: "And..."
Dipper says: "impossible!"
Ford says: "These things are outlawed in 9,000 dimensions."
Ford says: "You wanna know why?"
Ford says: "Look at those symbols."
Ford says: "Infinite sides means infinite outcomes."
Ford says: "If I rolled it, anything could happen."
Ford says: "Our faces could melt into jelly."
Ford says: "The world could turn into an egg."
Ford says: "Or you could just roll an eight."
Ford says: "Who knows."
Ford says: "That's why I have to keep it in this protective cheap plastic case."
Ford says: "Now, back to the game!"
Ford says: "You've got Probabilitor on the ropes."

Dipper says: "Sorry, Mabel, I got to finish this dungeon."
Dipper says: "It's going to totally stump Great uncle Ford tomorrow, I can't wait to see the look on his face."
Mabel says: "You're uh, spending a lot of time with old Fordsy lately, huh?"
Dipper says: "You have no idea."
Dipper says: "I knew the author must be cool, but he's better than I imagined."
Dipper says: "And, he doesn't make fun of me all the time, like you and Grunkle Stan do."

Grenda says: "Ah!"
Grenda says: "Graph paper!"
Grenda says: "Kill it!"
Grenda says: "Kill it!"
Mabel says: "Dipper, could you maybe move this to another room?"

Ford says: "We ran out of room in the basement and we're going for a world record!"
Ford says: "Now, dice!"
Ford says: "32, yes!"
Ford says: "7,000 points damage!"
Dipper says: "You got me!"
Stan says: "Oh, why, why with this?"
Stan says: "You wanna break a record, Ford?"
Stan says: "You already got it with world's nerdiest old man."
Ford says: "Hey, at least I'm not all keyed up to watch a kid's show."
Stan says: "I'll have you know that Duck-tective has a big mystery element!"
Stan says: "And a lot of humor that goes over kids' heads!"
Grenda says: "I don't get a lot of it, but I like animals in human situations."
Mabel says: "Grunkle Stan, it starts in a few minutes!"
Ford says: "Move that and pay the price!"
Stan says: "Oh, what, fifty magical dwarf dollars?"
Ford says: "Don't mock our fantastical monetary system!"
Stan says: "I'll mock all I want, it's my TV room!"
Ford says: "It's my house, you..."

Probabilitor says: "That's why I'm going to eat your brains to gain your intelligence."

Dipper says: "What do we do?"
Ford says: "Stop thinking, Dipper!"
Ford says: "The more wrinkly your brain gets, the more he'll want to eat it!"
Probabilitor says: "And now, a little math problem: when I subtract your brain from your skulls , add salt, and divide your family, what's the remainder?"
Mabel says: "YOUR BUTT!!"
Probabilitor says: "What?"
Probabilitor says: "My butt isn't part of this particular equation."

Stan says: "What?"
Stan says: "Really?"
Ford says: "Yes!"
Ford says: "I tried to tell you: this game involves math, but also risk, and imagination!"

Mabel says: "Man!"
Mabel says: "That was fun for ages 8 to 80!"
Mabel says: "Or a million or however old you guys are!"
Stan says: "Y'know, I'm sorry for making fun of your game, kiddo."
Stan says: "Sure, it might be too nerdy for me, bust it's just the right amount of nerdy for you and my brother."
Stan says: "If you two wanna hang out sometimes, I won't get in your way."
Dipper says: "Actually, after all that, I could use a little mindless fun."
Grenda says: "Guys!"
Grenda says: "We can watch the second showing of Duck-tective!"

Ford says: "Dipper, can I tell you something?"
Ford says: "You asked me earlier what I was working on."
Ford says: "Well,  an interdimensional rift."
Ford says: "I've contained it for now, but it's incredibly dangerous."
Ford says: "Dipper, I don't want you to tell anyone about this."
Ford says: "Not Stan, not even your sister."
Ford says: "You understand?"
Dipper says: "Oh-uh, of course."
Ford says: "In my time I've made many powerful enemies, but I trust you with this secret."
Ford says: "Now get yourself to bed."
Ford says: "I have much research to do."
Dipper says: "Goodnight, Great uncle Ford."
Ford says: "Goodnight, Dipper."
Credits says: "Soos, Blubs, Durland and Toby Determined are role-play fighting in the yard."
Durland says: "Guys, do you ever think that maybe we're doin' this 'cause our lives aren't special enough?"
Durland says: "That we use fantasy as an escape to avoid the self-improvement we all need?"
Durland says: "That maybe we should just go out and grow as people?"
Blubs says: "Fortresses can't speak, Durland."
Durland says: "I'm a fortress!"
Blubs says: "Does anyone want to rescue him?"
Durland says: "Eh, I'm good."
