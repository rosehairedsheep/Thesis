Dipper says: "We didn't get any photos of those gnomes, did we?"
Mabel says: "Nope, just memories."
Mabel says: "And this beard hair."
Dipper says: "Why did you save that?"

Stan says: "All right, maybe I haven't been the best summer caretaker."
Stan says: "But I swear, today we're gonna have some real family fun."
Stan says: "Now who wants to put on some blindfolds and get into my car?"
Dipper says: "YAY!"
Mabel says: "YAY!"
Dipper says: "Wait, what?"
Cut to theme song.
Cut to a road in the forest. Grunkle Stan is driving his car with Dipper and Mabel blindfolded in the backseat. Stan leans down to adjust the radio and the tires screech.
Dipper says: "Whoa whoa!"
Dipper says: "Blindfolds never lead to anything good."
Mabel says: "Wow!"
Mabel says: "I feel like all my other senses are heightened."
Mabel says: "I can see with my fingers!"
Car jumps, making the twins fly into the doors.
Dipper says: "Whoa!"
Dipper says: "Grunkle Stan, are you wearing a blindfold?"
Stan says: "Ha ha."
Stan says: "Nah, but with these cataracts I might as well be."
Stan says: "What is that, a woodpecker?"
Cut to the lake. Dipper and Mabel, still blindfolded, are standing in front of the parked car, which now has branches and sticks caught in the grill.
Stan says: "Okay, okay."
Stan says: "Open 'em up!"
Stan says: "Ta-da!"
Stan says: "It's fishin' season!"
Mabel says: "Fishing?"
Dipper says: "What're you playin' at, old man?"
Stan says: "You're gonna love it!"

Stan says: "That's some quality family bonding!"
Dipper says: "Grunkle Stan, why do you wanna bond with us all of a sudden?"
Stan says: "Come on, this is gonna be great!"
Stan says: "I've never had fishing buddies before."
Stan says: "The guys from the lodge won't go with me: they don't "like" or "trust" me."
Mabel says: "I think he actually wants to fish with us."
Stan says: "Hey, I know what'll cheer you sad sacks up."
Stan says: "Pow!"
Stan says: "Pines family fishing hats!"
Stan says: "That-that's hand stitching, you know."
The "L" on the "MABEL" hat peels off.
Stan says: "It's just gonna be you, me, and those goofy hats on a boat for ten hours!"
Dipper says: "Ten hours?"
Stan says: "I brought the joke book!"
Dipper says: "No!"
Dipper says: "NO!"
Mabel says: "There has to be a way out of this."
Old Man McGucket says: "Ah, hee-hee..."
Mabel says: "Awww..."
Mabel says: "He's doing a happy jig!"
McGucket says: "NOOO!"
McGucket says: "It's a jig of grave danger!"
Tate McGucket says: "Hey, hey!"

Tate McGucket says: "This is your last warning, Dad!"
McGucket says: "But I got proof this time, by gummity!"
Cut to dock.
Stan says: "Huh?"
McGucket says: "It chawed my boat up to smitheroons, and shim-shammed over to Scuttlebutt Island!"
McGucket says: "YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME!"
Sheriff Blubs says: "Attention all units!"
Sheriff Blubs says: "We got ourselves a crazy old man!"
Everyone but the Pines and the ranger point and laugh at Old Man McGucket.
McGucket says: "Aww, donkey spittle!"
McGucket says: "Aw, banjo polish!"
Stan says: "Well, that happened."
Stan says: "Now let's untie this boat and get out on that lake!"
Dipper says: "Mabel, did you hear what that old dude said?"
Mabel says: ""Aww, donkey shpittle!"
Dipper says: "The other thing."
Dipper says: "About the monster."
Dipper says: "If we can snag a photo of it, we can split the prize fifty-fifty."
Mabel says: "That's two fifties!"
Dipper says: "Imagine what you could do with five."
Dipper says: "Hundred."
Dipper says: "Dollars!"
Cut to Mabel's imagination. She is inside a human sized hamster ball in front of a hamster in a smaller hamster ball.
Mabel says: "Not so high and mighty anymore!"

Cut back to reality.
Dipper says: "Mabel!"
Dipper says: "Mabel?"
Mabel says: "Dipper, I am one million percent on board with this!"
Dipper says: "Grunkle Stan!"
Dipper says: "Change of plans: we're taking that boat to Scuttlebutt Island, and we're gonna find that Gobblewonker!"
Dipper says: "Monster hunt!"
Mabel says: "Monster hunt!"
Dipper says: "Monster hunt!"
Mabel says: "Monster hunt!"
McGucket says: "Monster hunt!"
Dipper and Mabel stop chanting and stare at McGucket.
McGucket says: "Monster..."
McGucket says: "Eh..."
McGucket says: "I'll go."
A large honking sound is heard.
Soos Ramirez says: "You dudes say somethin' about a monster hunt?"
Mabel says: "Soos!"
Soos says: "Wassup, hambone!"
Soos says: "Dude, you could totally use my boat for your hunt."
Soos says: "It's got a steering wheel, chairs; normal boat stuff."
Stan says: "All right, all right, let's think this through."
Stan says: "Ya kids could go waste your time on some epic monster-finding adventure, or you could spend the day learning how to tie knots and skewer worms with your Great Uncle Stan!"
The twins look at Soos in his boat; he does a robot dance. They look back at Stan in his leaky old boat; he sniffs his left armpit. They look at Scuttlebutt Island in the distance. They grin at each other.
Stan says: "So, whaddaya say?"
The twins drive off laughing with Soos in his boat toward Scuttlebutt Island, leaving Stan behind.
Mabel says: "We made the right choice!"
Soos says: "Yes!"
Stan says: "Ingrates!"
Stan says: "Aw, who needs 'em?"
Stan says: "I got a whole box of creepy fishing lures to keep me company."
Cut to S.S. Cool Dude, headed for the island. Dipper stands on the stern of the boat, with one foot on the guardrail. He adjusts the visor of his cap.
Dipper says: "Hoist the anchor!"
Dipper says: "Raise the flag!"
Mabel says: "We're gonna find that Gobblewonker!"
Dipper says: "We're gonna win that photo contest!"
Soos says: "Do any of you dudes have sunscreen?"
Dipper says: "We're gonna..."
Dipper says: "go get sunscreen!"
Mabel says: "Yay!"
Soos says: "Yay!"
The boat does a U-turn away from the island. Underwater, a strange shape swims by.
Cut to black for commercial break.
The scene begins with Dipper pacing on the boat in front of Mabel and Soos.
Dipper says: "Alright."
Dipper says: "If we wanna win this contest, we've gotta do it right!"
Dipper says: "Think."
Dipper says: "What's the number one problem with most monster hunts?"
Soos says: "You're a side character, then you die within the first five minutes of the movie."
Soos says: "Dude, am I a side character?!"
Soos says: "!"
Soos says: "Do y'ever think about stuff like that?"
Dipper says: "No, no, no."
Dipper says: "Camera trouble!"
Dipper says: "Say Bigfoot shows up."
Dipper says: "Soos, be Bigfoot?"
Dipper says: "You see?"
Dipper says: "You see what I'm, doing here?"
Soos says: "Oh, yeah."
Soos says: "Dude's got a point."
Dipper says: "That's why I bought seventeen disposable cameras!"
Dipper says: "Two on my ankle, three in my jacket, four for each of you, three extras in this bag, and one..."
Dipper says: "under my hat!"
Dipper says: "There's no way we're gonna miss this."
Dipper says: "Okay everybody, let's test our cameras out!"
Dipper says: "You see?"
Dipper says: "This is exactly why you need backup cameras."
Dipper says: "We still have sixteen!"
Mabel says: "Ah, bird!"
Dipper says: "Fifteen!"
Dipper says: "Okay, guys, I repeat; don't lose your cameras!"
Soos says: "Wait, lose the cameras?"
Dipper says: "DON'T!"
Soos says: "Dude, I just threw two away."
Dipper says: "Thirteen!"
Dipper says: "All right!"
Dipper says: "We still have thirteen camera--  Twelve."
Dipper says: "We have twelve cameras."
Mabel says: "So what's the plan?"
Mabel says: "Throw more cameras overboard or what?"
Dipper says: "NO!"
Dipper says: "No."
Dipper says: "Okay."
Dipper says: "You'll be lookout, Soos can work the steering wheel, and I'll be captain."
Mabel says: "What?"
Mabel says: "Why do you get to be captain?"
Mabel says: "What about Mabel, huh?"
Mabel says: "Ma-bel!"
Mabel says: "Ma-bel!"
Mabel says: "Ma-bel!"
Mabel says: "Ma-bel!"
Dipper says: "I'm not sure that's a good idea."
Mabel says: "What about co-captain?"
Dipper says: "There's no such thing as co-captain."
Mabel says: "Aw, whoops."
Dipper says: "Okay, fine!"
Dipper says: "You can be co-captain."
Soos says: "Can I be associate co-captain?"
Mabel says: "As co-captain, I authorize that request."
Dipper says: "Well, as first co-captain, our number one order of business is to lure the monster out with this."
Soos says: "Permission to taste some?"
Dipper says: "Granted."
Mabel says: "Permission co-granted."
Soos says: "Permission associate co-granted."
Soos says: "Dude, I don't know what I expected that to taste like!"
Dipper says: "Oh, Soos..."
Stan says: "There's my new pals!"
Reginald says: "Now that we're alone, Rosanna, there's a burning question which my heart longs to ask of you."
Rosanna says: "Oh, Reginald!"
Stan says: "Hey!"
Stan says: "Y'see, it's-it's funny because marriage is terrible."
Stan says: "What?"
Cut to S.S. Cool Dude approaching Scuttlebutt Island. There is fog everywhere. Soos is at the back of the boat shoveling fish food over the side. Dipper and Mabel are at the front. Dipper is trying to see through the fog while Mabel is playing ventriloquist with a pelican.
Mabel says: "Hey!"
Mabel says: "How's it going?"
Mabel says: "It's going awesome!"
Mabel says: "Bow bow, buh bow bow!"
Dipper says: "Mabel, leave that thing alone."
Dipper says: "Aren't you supposed to be doing lookout?"
Mabel says: "Look out!"
Mabel says: "Heh, heh."
Mabel says: "But seriously, I'm on it."
The boat jolts to a sudden stop having crashed into the shore of the island.
Mabel says: "See?"
Mabel says: "We're here!"
Mabel says: "I'm a lookout genius!"
Mabel says: "Hamster ball, here we come!"
The trio disembarks and ventures into the foggy woods. Dipper leads the group while carrying a lantern. They soon come to a large sign nailed to a tree that says "Scuttlebutt Island." Soos and Mabel stop in front of it.
Soos says: "Dude, check it out."
Soos says: "Butt Island."
Mabel says: "Soos, you rapscallion!"
Mabel says: "Hey!"
Mabel says: "Why aren't you laughing?"
Mabel says: "Are you scared?"
Dipper says: "Pssh!"
Dipper says: "Yeah, right!"
Mabel says: "Yeah, you are!"
Dipper says: "Hey!"
Dipper says: "Quit..."
Dipper says: "!"
Dipper says: "Stop!"
Dipper says: "Mabel!"
There's a growling noise in the distance. Mabel stops teasing Dipper and they look around. Soos comes up to them.
Soos says: "Dude, did you guys hear that?"
Mabel says: "What was that?"
Mabel says: "Was it your stomach?"
Soos says: "Nah, my stomach normally sounds like whale noises."
Mabel says: "Wow."
Mabel says: "So majestic."
Dipper says: "Our lantern!"
Dipper says: "Aww!"
Dipper says: "I can't see anything!"
Soos says: "Duuude, I dunno, man."
Soos says: "Maybe this, uh..."
Soos says: "Maybe this isn't worth it."
Dipper says: "Not worth it?"
Dipper says: "Guys, imagine what would happen if we got that picture!"
Cut to Dipper's imagination, where he is dressed like Indiana Jones being interviewed on a talk show.
Charlie says: "Tonight we're here with adventure seeker Dipper Pines, who bravely photographed the elusive Gobblewonker!"
Charlie says: "Tell me, Dipper: what's the secret to your success?"
Dipper says: "Well, I run away from nothing."
Dipper says: "Nothing, except for when I ran away from my annoying Grunkle Stan, who I ditched in order to pursue that lake monster."
Charlie says: "How right you were to do so."
Charlie says: "He looked like a real piece of work."
Charlie says: "I don't often do this, but I feel the need to give you an award!"
Cut back to real life.
Dipper says: "I'm in!"
Mabel says: "Me, too!"
Soos says: "All right, dudes, I'm comin'!"
Mabel says: "My name is Mabel!"
Mabel says: "It rhymes with table!"
Mabel says: "It also rhymes with..."
Mabel says: "glabel!"
Mabel says: "It also rhymes with..."
Mabel says: "shmabel!"
Soos says: "Dude, we should be writing this down."
Dipper says: "Guys, guys, guys!"
Dipper says: "You hear something?"
The growling noise from earlier can be heard; a flock of birds flies overhead, away from the sound.
Dipper says: "This is it!"
Dipper says: "This is it!"
Dipper says: "Yes yes yes!"
Mabel says: "Yes yes yes!"
Dipper says: "Hoo hoo hoo!"
Mabel says: "Hoo hoo hoo!"
Walking through the fog, Soos stops the group when he spots a lake monster silhouette. The group ducks behind a log.
Dipper says: "Everyone: Get your cameras ready!"
Dipper says: "Ready?"
Dipper says: "GO!"
Soos yells and jumps over the log, holding his camera in front of him as he runs toward the silhouette, snapping photos at random. The twins follow him, but as they get closer, they discover the silhouette was the remains of a wrecked boat with beavers living on it.
Beaver 1.
Subtitled I love cavorting!
Beaver 2.
Subtitled That deserves a hug! Hugs Beaver 1.
Beaver 3.
Thumps tail and walks sideways of the boat.
Dipper says: "But..."
Dipper says: "but what was that noise, then?"
Dipper says: "I heard a monster noise!"
The "monster noise" sounds again. It turns out to be a beaver chewing on, and sometimes activating, a rusty old chainsaw.
Soos says: "Sweet!"
Soos says: "Beaver with a chainsaw."
Dipper says: "Maybe that old guy was crazy after all."
Mabel says: "He did use the word "scrapdoodle."
Cut to Stan teaching Hank's son how to thread a line.
Stan says: "Look, when you're threadin' the line--lot of people don't know this--but you wanna use a barrel knot."
Stan says: "That's a secret from one fishing buddy to another!"
Stan says: "Heh heh."
Hank's son says: "Uh, I, uh, who are you, exactly?"
Stan says: "Just call me your GRUNKLE STAN!"
Hank's wife says: "Sir, SIR, SIR!"
Hank's wife says: "Why are you talking to our son?"
Hank's wife says: "If you don't leave right now, I'm calling the police!"
Stan says: "Ha ha, you see, the thing about that is..."
Hank's Wife says: "Go bother your own kids!"
Cut back to Scuttlebutt Island.
Soos says: "Ooh, yeah!"
Soos says: "Work it!"
Soos says: "Work it!"
Soos says: "Nice!"
Soos says: "Nice!"
Soos says: "Gimme another one of those!"
Soos says: "Yeah, I like that one."
Dipper says: "What're we gonna say to Grunkle Stan?"
Dipper says: "We ditched him over nothing."
Dipper says: "Hey, hey, whoa, whoa!"
The Gobblewonker's silhouette is seen swimming away.
Mabel says: "Ahhh!"
Dipper says: "This is it!"
Dipper says: "What's wrong with you guys?"
Mabel says: "Dipper..."
Mabel says: "?"
Soos says: "Dude..."
Soos says: "?"
Dipper says: "It's not that hard, all right?"
Dipper says: "All you gotta do is point, and shoot."
Dipper says: "Like this!"
Soos says: "Run!"
The Gobblewonker pushes a tree over which falls and almost hits Dipper and Mabel, but Dipper lunges and Mabel and they roll out of the way. The continue to run and dodge falling trees and eventually catch up with Soos.
Soos says: "Get back to the boat!"
Soos says: "HURRY!"
Soos says: "Dude, if it makes you feel any better, I got tons of pictures of those beavers, dude!"
Dipper says: "WHY WOULD THAT MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Commercial break.
Open with the group running towards the boat. Soos helps the others on, the climbs in himself. Soos's presence pushes the boat back into the water and he runs towards the helm.
Soos says: "Let's get outta here, dudes!"
Dipper says: "All right!"
Dipper says: "This is it!"
Dipper says: "Cracked lens?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Dipper says: "Soos!"
Dipper says: "Get a photo!"
Dipper says: "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"
Dipper says: "!"
Soos says: "Oh!"
Soos says: "I still got one left!"
Soos says: "Don't worry, dude!"
The Gobblewonker dives into the water and begins to chase the gang. Soos steers the ship forwards and drives away from it.
Dipper says: "Go, go, go, go, go!"

Shmipper says: "Maybe he has no one who wuvs him, Pop Pop."
Stan says: "Yeah, well, I..."
Stan says: "I..."
S.S. Cool Dude drives past him and soaks him. He throws his hat to the ground in frustration, then sits down and sighs.
Dipper says: "SOOS!"
Dipper says: "BEAVERS!"
Beavers says: "We're still beavers."
The boat crashes into the old, broken boat and beavers fly everywhere, biting the boat and the crew.
Soos says: "Ah, beavers!"
Soos says: "Oh, no!"
Beavers are biting Dipper's hat. Mabel shakes a beaver off of her arm, and a beaver lunges at Soos, who stumbles away from the wheel. Mabel takes control on the wheel, steering away from the Gobblewonker. Dipper tries to dislodge a beaver from the side of the boat while Soos runs in circles crying in pain from the beaver still on his face. Dipper throws beavers towards the Gobblewonker who dives and continues to chase them under the water. The S.S. Cool Dude drives through a place with people fishing, who are overturned by the Gobblewonker behind them.

Manly Dan says: "The fishes!"
Manly Dan says: "They seek revenge!"
Manly Dan says: "Swim, boys!"
Manly Dan says: "Swim!"
Cut back to the S.S. Cool Dude. The Gobblewonker swipes at the boat and manages to knock the control cabin off.
Mabel says: "Aah!"
Mabel says: "Look out!"
Man says: "Easy..."
Man says: "Easy..."
The boat drives through it and breaks it.

Mabel says: "WHERE DO I GO?!"
Mabel says: "!"
Dipper says: "Um..."
Dipper says: "uh..."
Dipper says: "GO INTO THE FALLS!"
Dipper says: "I think there might be a cave behind there!"
Mabel says: "MIGHT BE?!"
Mabel says: "!"
They all scream and the boat goes through the waterfall and into cave behind. Their boat crashes, sending them into the dirt. The all stand up, and turn around to see the Gobblewonker swim in after them and get stuck in the cave entrance.
Mabel says: "It's stuck!"

Dipper says: "I've got this!"
Dipper says: "Hold on!"
Dipper says: "Hey, guys!"

McGucket says: "Well, I..."
McGucket says: "I, uh..."
McGucket says: "I just wanted attention."
Dipper says: "I still don't understand."
Old Man McGucket says: "Well, first I just hootenannied up a biomechanical brain wave generator, and then I learned to operate a stick-shift with ma beard!"
Mabel says: "Okay, yeah."
Mabel says: "But why did you do it?"
Old Man McGucket says: "Well, when you get to be an old fella like me, nobody pays any attention to you anymore."
Old Man McGucket says: "In retrospect, it seems a bit contrived."
Old Man McGucket says: "You just don't know the length us old-timers go through for a little quality time with our family."
Soos says: "Dude."
Soos says: "I guess the real lake monster is you two."
Soos says: "Heh, heh!"
Soos says: "Sorry, that just like--boom--just popped into my head there."

Stan says: "Save your sympathy!"
Stan says: "I've been having a great time withoutcha'!"
Stan says: "Makin' friends, talkin' to my reflection-- I had a run-in with the lake police!"
Stan says: "Guess I gotta wear this ankle bracelet now, so that'll be fun."
Dipper says: "So..."
Dipper says: "I guess there isn't room in that boat for three more?"
Stan says: "You knuckleheads ever seen me thread a hook with my eyes closed?"
Dipper says: "Five bucks says you can't do it!"
Stan says: "You're on!"
Mabel says: "Five more bucks says you can't do it with your eyes closed, plus me singing at the top of my lungs!"
Stan says: "I like those odds!"
