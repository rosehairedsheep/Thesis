The episode begins with Soos and Wendy preparing for a party. Mabel and Dipper are sitting on a couch.
Dipper Pines says: "Oh no, Mabel."
Dipper Pines says: "I-I don't feel so good."
Dipper Pines says: "I-BBBBLLLAAAA!"
Mabel Pines says: "Ohhh, Grunkle Stan, what did you feed us?!"
Mabel Pines says: "!"
Mabel Pines says: "BBBBBLLLAAAA!"
Dipper says: "BBBBLLLAAAA!"
Mabel says: "BBBBLLLAAAA!"
Dipper says: "BBBBLLLAAA!"
Mabel says: "Hahaha, barfing!"
Wendy Corduroy says: "Guys, guys, stop!"
Wendy Corduroy says: "Something terrible just happened!"
Wendy says: "BBBBLLLAAAA!"
Mabel says: "Comedy gold!"
Stan Pines says: "Alright, alright!"
Stan Pines says: "Party supplies are now off-limits."
Soos Ramirez says: "Mr."
Soos Ramirez says: "Pines, whose birthday is it again?"
Stan says: "Nobody's."
Stan says: "Thought this party might be a good way to get kids to spend money at the Shack."
Soos says: "Nice!"
Stan says: "The young people of this town want fun; I'll smother 'em with fun!"
Dipper says: "Maybe comments like that are why kids don't go to the Mystery Shack."
Stan says: "Hey, hey!"
Stan says: "Hows about you make yourself useful and copy these flyers?"
Mabel says: "Oh boy, a trip to the copier store!"
Soos says: "Calendars, mugs, t-shirts and more!"
Soos says: "They got it all at the copier store!"
Soos says: "That's not their slogan, I just really feel that way about the copier store."
Stan says: "Save the trouble."
Stan says: "You know the old copier in my office?"
Stan says: "I finally fixed the old girl up!"
Stan says: "Good as new!"
Dipper and Mabel are in Stan's office. They pull the sheet off the old, busted up copier machine. Several moths fly around it.
Mabel says: "Butterflies!"
Mabel says: "Whoa!"
The picture of Dipper's arm comes to life and begins to crawl near them.
Mabel says: "AH!"
Dipper says: "AH!"
Dipper says: "Stay back!"
Dipper says: "Oh my gosh!"
Dipper says: "Mabel, I think this copier can copy human beings!"
Mabel says: "Do you realize what this means?"
Cut to theme song.
Stan addresses Soos, Wendy, Mabel, and Dipper, who are all standing side-by-side.
Stan says: "Alright party people..."
Stan says: "and Dipper."
Stan says: "Let's talk business."
Stan says: "Soos, because you'll work for free, and you begged, I'm lettin' you be DJ."
Soos says: "You won't regret it, Mr."
Soos says: "Pines."
Soos says: "I got this book to teach me how to DJ R-R-Right!"
Stan says: "Not encouraging."
Stan says: "Wendy, you and Mabel will work at the ticket stand."
Mabel says: "What?"
Mabel says: "But Grunkle Stan, this party is my chance to make new friends!"
Dipper says: "I..."
Dipper says: "I could work with Wendy."
Stan says: "You realize that if you do, you gotta commit to stay in at the ticket stand with Wendy."
Stan says: "No getting out of it, just the two of you, alone, all night."
Dipper says: "What?"
Dipper says: "Yeah, yeah."
Dipper says: "Laugh all you want, but I devised a plan to make sure my night with Wendy goes perfect."
Mabel says: "Plan?"
Mabel says: "Oh, you're not making one of those overcomplicated listy things, are you?"
Dipper says: "Psh."
Dipper says: "Over complicated?"
Dipper says: "Let me just..."
Dipper says: "alright, fold that there, kay."
Dipper says: "Step 1: Getting to know each with playful banter."
Dipper says: "Banter is like talking but smarter."
Mabel says: "That sounds like a dumb idea for poopheads."
Dipper says: "Yeah, see?"
Dipper says: "This isn't banter."
Dipper says: "This is what I want to avoid with Wendy."
Dipper says: "The final step is to ask her to dance."
Wendy says: "Oh Dipper!"
Wendy says: "I'm so happy you decided to work the ticket stand with me; you're so organized."
Wendy says: "Show me that checklist again."
Wendy says: "Oh!"
Dipper says: "If I follow steps 1 through 11, nothing can get in my way!"
Mabel says: "Dipper, you're the one getting in your way."
Mabel says: "Why can't you just walk up and talk to her like a normal person?"
Dipper says: "Step 9, sister!"
The party begins. Stan walks over to Mabel.
Stan says: "Can your uncle throw a party or what?"
Soos says: "lightning, lightning, lightning..."
Stan says: "And if anyone wants to leave, I'm charging an exit fee of 15 bucks!"
Nate says: "We've only got 13!"
Lee says: "We're trapped!"
Outside, Wendy and Dipper are working at the ticket station.
Dipper says: "What's your favorite type of snack food?"
Wendy says: "Oh, man!"
Wendy says: "I can't just pick one!"
Dipper says: "NO way!"
Dipper says: "Mine too!"
Wendy says: "Wait, what?"
Dipper says: "Uhh..."
Dipper says: "I mean..."
Dipper says: "I mean..."
Mabel says: "Wow!"
Mabel says: "You've got an animal on your body!"
Mabel says: "I'm Mabel."
Grenda says: "Hi, I'm Grenda."
Grenda says: "This is Candy."
Mabel says: "Why do have forks taped to your fingers?"
Candy says: "Improvement of human being."
Mabel says: "I've found my people!"
Soos says: "Remember dudes,  Most applause at the end of the night wins!"
Grenda says: "Wow!"
Candy says: "Wow!"
Pacifica Northwest says: "Party crown?"
Pacifica Northwest says: "I'll take that, thank you very much!"
Mabel says: "Who's that?"
Candy says: "The most popular girl in town, Pacifica Northwest."
Grenda says: "I always feel bad about myself around her."
Soos says: "I can't just give you the crown."
Soos says: "It's sort of a competition thing."
Grenda says: "Hold me, Candy!"
Candy says: "Our kind isn't welcome here!"
Mabel says: "Hey, I'll compete!"
Mabel says: "I'm Mabel."
Pacifica says: "That sounds like a fat old lady's name."
Mabel says: "I'll take that as a compliment!"
Pacifica says: "May the better partier win."
Mabel says: "She's going down."
Wendy says: "Whoa!"
Wendy says: "Sounds like the party's getting nuts."
Soos says: "Let the battle for the party crown begin!"
Soos says: "Mabel comes out strong!"
Soos says: "Watch out, Pacifica!"
Wendy says: "I gotta get in there!"
Wendy says: "Cover for me?"
Dipper says: "Umm..."
Wendy says: "Thanks, man!"
Stan says: "Hey!"
Stan says: "What are you doing, kid?"
Stan says: "These suckers aren't gonna rip themselves off!"
Kid says: "Yeah!"
Stan says: "You promised, remember?"
Dipper says: "I did?"
Dipper's voice says: "I promise."
Wendy says: "Woo-hoo-hoo!"
Dipper says: "If only I could be two places at once."
Dipper says: "I wonder if this is a good idea."
Dipper is copied. The paper with the copy of him falls to the ground. It ripples, and the Dipper clone comes to life.
Dipper says: "Whoa!"
Dipper says: "..."
Dipper says: "I have a really big head."
Dipper says: "So, uh..."
Clone says: "So, uh..."
Clone says: "Ow, ow!"
Clone says: "Funny bone!"
Dipper says: "I will call you: Number 2."
Number 2.
Definitely not. You know a name I've always wanted?
Dipper and Number 2.
Tyrone?
Dipper says: "Okay, Tyrone."
Dipper says: "Let's get down to business."
Dipper says: "I'm thinking you cover me at the ticket stand, while I ask Wendy to dance."
Tyrone says: "I know the plan, buddy."
Dipper says: "Hey, we're not gonna get jealous and turn on each other like the clones in the movies, are we?"
Tyrone says: "Dipper, please."
Tyrone says: "This is you you're talking about."
Tyrone says: "Plus, hey!"
Tyrone says: "You can always just disintegrate with me with water."
Dipper says: "Yeeeeah!"
Tyrone says: "Yeeeeah!"
Tyrone mans the ticket station while Dipper is inside. They give each other the thumbs up. Dipper then walks over to Wendy.
Dipper says: "Great news, Wendy!"
Dipper says: "I got someone to cover the concessions for me!"
Wendy says: "That's awesome."
Wendy says: "You can hang out with me and Robbie."
Wendy says: "Robbie you remember Dipper from the convenience store?"
Robbie Valentino says: "Uh, no."
Robbie Valentino says: "Yo, Wendy, check out my new guitar."
Wendy says: "Whoa, cool!"
Wendy says: "Robbie, you're a stupid, arrogant fraud; but kiss me anyway because you can play guitar."
Wendy says: "Oh wait, I forgot something."
Wendy says: "LET'S GET MARRIED TONIGHT!"
Tyrone says: "Hey buddy it's me, you."
Tyrone says: "I just had the same jealousy fantasy."
Dipper says: "We got to get rid of Robbie if I ever want to dance with Wendy!"
Wendy says: "Hey, Dipper!"
Wendy says: "We're gonna go sit on the couch!"
Wendy says: "Meet us when you're done."
Dipper says: "Oh no!"
Dipper says: "They're sitting on the couch!"
Dipper says: "We gotta think of something quick!"
Dipper says: "I got an idea!"
Tyrone says: "I got the same one."
Tyrone says: "But we're gonna need some help."
Dipper says: "And that's where you come in number three!"
Number 3.
But what if Robbie catches me? I'll be all alone!
Tyrone says: "Yeah, makes a good point."
Dipper says: "Okay, one more."
Dipper says: "Good point."
Dipper says: "Four Dippers."
Dipper says: "This is a four Dipper plan."
The machine jams.
Tyrone says: "Uh-oh, paper jam."
Paper Jam Dipper says: "NYANYANYANYANYA-NAAAAA-NAAAAA."
Paper Jam Dipper says: "AAXUXAASSUAA-AAAA."
Number 3.
C'mon, you're not gonna make me partner up with him, are you?
Tyrone says: "Hey, buddy hey."
Tyrone says: "It's okay."
Paper Jam Dipper says: "AAAA-KKKKKKKXXX-KKKKXXX-A."
Dipper says: "Okay."
Dipper says: "Just one more clone."
Cut to Pacifica on a stage.
Pacifica says: "Forever."
Grenda says: "I used to sing like that, before my voice changed."
Soos says: "Pacifica pulls ahead!"
Pacifica says: "Try and top that!"
Pacifica says: "Oh, and Grenda, by the way, you sound like a professional wrestler."
Grenda says: "I WANNA PUT HER IN A HEADLOCK AND MAKE HER FEEL PAIN!"
Mabel says: "It's not over 'til it's over, sisters!"
Mabel says: "Watch this."
Mabel says: "Soos!"
Mabel says: "Give me the 80s-ist, crowd pleasing-ist, rock ballad-y-ist song you got!"
Mabel says: "Excellent."
Mabel says: "Don't start UN-BELIEVING!"
Never don't not feel your feelings! Everyone cheers.
Twirls her mic around.
WATCH ME DO A FLIP! lands on her face.
THAT WAS FOR YOU GUYS!
Everyone cheers except Pacifica, who looks at the crowd, and Dipper whispers something in Soos' ear.
Soos says: "Dudes, would the owner of a silver and red dirt bike please report outside."
Soos says: "It is being stolen right now."
Robbie says: "Wait, WHAT?!"
Robbie says: "!"
Clones 3 and 4 ride Robbie's bike away from the shack and laugh.
Robbie says: "Hey, come back here!"
Dipper says: "Oh, tough break."
Dipper says: "I wonder who those guys are who aren't me because I'm right here."
Soos says: "Now we're gonna bring it down for a minute."
Soos says: "Ladies, dudes, now's the time."
Wendy says: "Oh snap, I love this song."
Mabel says: "Now's your chance to ask Wendy to dance!"
Mabel says: "C'mon!"
Mabel says: "Go!"
Dipper says: "Ok, ok."
Dipper says: "Uh, I'll be right back!"
Cut to Tyrone says: "Tyrone: Oh, I agree."
Dipper pacing around each other in the attic says: "Tyrone: Oh, I agree."
Cut to Tyrone says: "You can't just go and DANCE with her."
Dipper pacing around each other in the attic says: "You can't just go and DANCE with her."
Dipper says: "The dance floor is a minefield, a MINEFIELD, Tyrone!"
Tyrone says: "What if there's a glitch in the sound system?"
Dipper says: "Stan might get in the way."
Tyrone says: "Robbie might come back."
Dipper says: "There's too many variables."
Dipper says: "We need help."
Dipper makes 6 more clones of himself.
Dipper says: "Alright, Dippers!"
Dipper says: "Gather round!"
Dipper says: "Now's the time!"
Dipper says: "You all clear on want to do?"
The clones nod monotonously and leave the attic. Number 10 walks up the Soos.
Number 10.
Hey, Soos, look! A glowing dot!
Soos says: "Oh man, I'm so glad I turned my head."
Soos says: "That dot does not disappoint."
While Soos is distracted, number 10 puts in a disc labeled "Wendy Mix." The rest of the clones do their jobs as well. Number 8, who is sitting above the party, puts a dollar on a fishing rod and dangles it in front of Stan.
Stan says: "Right, like I'm gonna fall for that."
Stan says: "MONEY, MONEY!"
While Stan is distracted, Number 6 rings a bell.
Tyrone says: "There's your cue."
Tyrone says: "It's the perfect moment to ask Wendy to dance."
Tyrone says: "Good luck, me!"
Dipper says: "I don't need luck."
Dipper says: "I have a plan."
Dipper says: "AH!"
Wendy says: "Oh hey, man."
Wendy says: "What's up?"
Dipper says: "W-What are you doing here?"
Dipper says: "I mean, wouldn't you rather be out on the dance floor,  uh, in like exactly 42 seconds?"
Wendy says: "I'm just waiting for the bathroom."
Dipper says: "Um, uh, okay."
Dipper says: "Small talk, small talk, small talk!"
Wendy says: "So hey, let's say everyone at this party gets stuck on a desert island."
Wendy says: "Who do you think the leader would be?"
Dipper says: "I, uh..."
Wendy says: "I think I'd go with this lunatic."
Dipper says: "Ha, ha, ha."
Wendy says: "Speaking of tall, wanna see something?"
Wendy says: "boooop."
Dipper says: "Ha, you were a freak!"
Wendy says: "Yep."
Dipper says: "You know, kids used to make fun of my birthmark before I started hiding it all the time."
Wendy says: "Birthmark?"
Dipper says: "Uh, no!"
Dipper says: "It's nothing!"
Dipper says: "I-I was-I wa–why did I say that?"
Wendy says: "No way, dude!"
Wendy says: "Now you have to show me!"
Wendy says: "Show me, show me!"
Wendy says: "The Big Dipper!"
Wendy says: "That's how you got your nickname!"
Wendy says: "I thought your parents just hated you or something."
Wendy says: "Hey, I guess we're both freaks."
Dipper says: "Of course."
Tyrone says: "Hey!"
Tyrone says: "What are you doing up here?"
Tyrone says: "Number 10 has been distracting Soos for 15 minutes; he's gonna get tired of that dot eventually!"
Soos says: "Never!"
Dipper says: "You won't believe it guys!"
Dipper says: "I bumped into Wendy accidentally and things are actually going great!"
Tyrone says: "That's nice, but not the plan."
Tyrone says: "Do we have to remind you?"
Dipper says: "Oh man, you guys sound crazy."
Dipper says: "Look, maybe we don't need the plan anymore, you know?"
Dipper says: "Maybe I could just go talk to her like a normal person."
Number 7.
You bite your tongue!
Number 5.
If you're not gonna stick to the plan, maybe you shouldn't be the Dipper to dance with Wendy.
Clones says: "Yes/If you think about it..."
Clones says: "Five/Number Five's got a point."
Dipper says: "Guys, c'mon."
Dipper says: "We said we weren't gonna turn on each other."
Tyrone says: "I think we all knew we were lying."
Dipper says: "No, no, hey, hey!"
Dipper says: "AAAAAH!"
Dipper says: "No, wait!"
Dipper says: "Ahh, I can't breath in here!"
Tyrone says: "Yes you can!"
Tyrone says: "Plus there's snacks and a coloring book in there for you!"
Dipper says: "Omnomnom..."
Tyrone says: "Okay, now that Original Dipper or "Dipper Classic" is no longer fit for it, I nominate myself to dance with Wendy instead."
Tyrone says: "I've been around the longest, so it should be me."
Tyrone says: "Right?"
Tyrone says: "I mean logically."
Tyrone says: "Logically, guys."
Number 10.
Fair point, fair point. Counterpoint, maybe I should get to dance with Wendy because I've been around her the least.
Number 5.
That makes, like, zero sense.
Number 10.
Pushes number 5 YOU MAKE ZERO SENSE!
Number 5.
Shoves number 10 Watch it!
Number 6.
Shoves number 5 Don't shove people!
Paper Jam Dipper says: "NANANANANA-AAAAAAA!"
Tyrone says: "Hey, you want some cheese and crackers, buddy?"
Paper Jam Dipper says: "KKSSKSKSS."
Tyrone says: "Hey, guys, what would you do if you were trapped in a closet?"
Number 5 to 10.
Break out. Looks at closet to see that it's open.
Dipper says: "WEND-!"
Number 5.
Covers his mouth and drags him back to the other clones.
Tyrone says: "C'mon, man."
Tyrone says: "Give it up."
Tyrone says: "You're overpowered."
Dipper says: "Hold on guys, think about it."
Dipper says: "We're exact equals mentally and physically."
Dipper says: "If we start fighting, it'll just go on for infinity."
As the clones agree, Dipper punches Tyrone. The clones stare at them and there is an awkward pause.
Number 9.
CLONE FIGHT!
The clones start fighting each other.
Number 5.
Slapping Dipper Quit hitting myself, quit hitting myself! Is tackled by Number 8.
Numbers 5 says: "Tyrone: Guys guys, c'mon it's me!"
8 hold Tyrone back as 10 slaps him in the stomach says: "Tyrone: Guys guys, c'mon it's me!"
As the clones fight, Dipper crawls through the crowd and nearly gets away. They notice Dipper and the fight stops.
Number 10.
Hey! Classic Dipper's getting away!
Dipper says: "No friends, it's me, Number 7."
The clones stare at the real Number 7.
Number 7.
Shaking his head and panicking That's not me guys, that's not me!
The fake #7 mark on Dipper's hat peels off.
Number 9.
Get him!
The clones march toward Dipper cornering him & Dipper backs away from them.
Dipper says: "Stay back, stay back!"
Clones says: "Boo!"
Clones says: "C'mon!"
Clones says: "Lame!"
Clones says: "This stinks!"
Clones says: "Boo!"
Tyrone says: "You!"
Dipper says: "Uh-oh."
Cut to the party room. Mabel is doing the worm.
Soos says: "One more song, dudes, and then it's time for the bestowing of the party crown."
Soos says: "It's gonna be the–  Nailed it."
Mabel says: "Pacifica, I just wanna say that whoever wins, it's been a super fun party."
Pacifica says: "Tsk."
Pacifica says: "Awwww, it thinks it's gonna win."
Pacifica says: "Hey, did you hear that?"
Pacifica says: "People clapping for the weird girls?"
Pacifica says: "Yeah, me neither."
Cut back to Dipper and Tyrone fighting.
Tyrone says: "Say it!"
Tyrone says: "Say I can dance with Wendy!"
Dipper says: "Never!"
Dipper says: "Wendy?"
Tyrone says: "Wendy?"
Tyrone says: "I don't know, you wanna go grab a couple sodas or something?"
Cut to the party room.
Soos says: "Let the party crown voting commence!"
Pacifica says: "Good luck, Mabel."
Soos says: "Applaud to vote for Mabel."
The crowd applauds loudly.
Soos says: "Let's check the applause meter."
Soos says: "Oh, oh, very good."
Soos says: "And the next contestant: Pacifica."
The crowd applauds quietly, but Pacifica glares at them angrily. More people reluctantly start to clap for her.
Soos says: "Uh-oh, a tie!"
Soos says: "This has like, never happened before."
Old Man McGucket says: "Ha!"
Old Man McGucket says: "Haha!"
Old Man McGucket says: "Hahahahaha!"
Soos says: "Ladies and gentlemen, we-we have a winner."
Pacifica says: "Thank you, Jorge."
Pacifica says: "Thank you everyone!"
Pacifica says: "Everyone comes to the after-party at my parents' boat!"
Pacifica says: "Woo-hoo!"
Crowd says: "Pacifica!"
Crowd says: "Pacifica!"
Crowd says: "Pacifica!"
Mabel says: "Sorry I let you guys down."
Mabel says: "I understand if you wanna leave."
Candy says: "But then, we will miss the sleepover."
Mabel says: "The what?"
Grenda says: "We want to call our moms and see if we can sleep over here with you."
Grenda says: "You're like, a total rock star!"
Candy says: "I have magazine boys."
Mabel says: "Really?"
Mabel says: "You GUUYS!"
Candy says: "Maybe we don't have as many friends as Pacifica, but we have each other, and that is pretty good I think."
Mabel says: "Soos!"
Mabel says: "Play another song!"
Mabel says: "This thing's going all night!"
Soos says: "Way ahead of you, hambone."
Mabel says: "This is it!"
Mabel says: "This is it!"
Candy says: "Dance!"
Candy says: "Dance!"
Candy says: "Dance!"
Cut to the roof, Dipper passes Tyrone a can of soda.
Tyrone says: "Some night, huh?"
A shooting star flies across the starry night. Dipper and Tyrone open the cans.
Dipper says: "You think we even have a chance with Wendy?"
Dipper says: "I mean she's 15, we're 12."
Tyrone says: "I don't know man, I hope so, but we're making zero progress the way we're doin' it."
Tyrone says: "The only good conversation you had with her is when you didn't do anything in that list-stuff."
Dipper says: "I know."
Dipper says: "Mabel was right, I do get in my own way."
Dipper says: "Literally!"
Tyrone says: "Literally!"
Tyrone says: "Wow!"
Tyrone says: "."
Tyrone says: "Oh boy, don't look now."
Dipper says: "Tyrone!"
Tyrone says: "It's okay dude, I had a good run."
Tyrone says: "Remember what we talked about."
Dipper says: "Uh-uh, of course."
Tyrone says: "Hey, and quit being such a wimp around Wendy okay?"
Tyrone says: "For my sake..."
Tyrone says: "BLBLBLBLBLBL!"
Dipper says: "Tyrone!"
Dipper says: "You were the only one who understood."
Stan says: "Hahaha!"
Soos is playing music and the girls are dancing. Wendy is by the side nodding her head to the beat. Dipper prepares to go in, then stops and rips up the list and goes inside the shack.
Mabel says: "Dipper!"
Mabel says: "Where have you been?"
Mabel says: "Meet my girlfriends!"
End credits.
Soos says: "Found it."
