A kid is drinking from a water fountain when time starts to slow down. Two kids playing in the laser tag arena also slow down and stop. Soos's coin stops in mid-air.
Soos says: "Huh."
Soos says: "That's..."
Soos says: "unconventional."
Dipper says: "Soos!"
Mabel says: "Soos!"
Soos says: "G-guys!"
Dipper says: "We're so sorry we left you hanging dude."
Mabel says: "Heheh."
Dipper says: "Time race!"
Mabel says: "Time race!"
Mabel says: "But, the point is, Soos, we think we know how to fix your birthday."
Soos says: "Woah, really?"
Soos says: "Wait, you guys did all of that..."
Soos says: "for me?"
Blendin says: "And that's not all."
Blendin says: "Behold your time wish!"
Blendin says: "The power to alter time paradox free in any way you choose."
Dipper says: "We think the only thing that can make you happy is meeting your dad."
Mabel says: "But the choice is yours."
Soos says: "You mean I can finally see my dad by touching this thing?"
Soos says: "And you guys battled through time and space just to get this for me?"
Dipper says: "What are you waiting for, Soos?"
Dipper says: "What the--?"
Mabel says: "Wait what?"
Soos says: "Bam!"
Soos says: "I fixed you dudes up."
Dipper says: "But Soos, what about meeting your dad?"
Soos says: "Well, birthdays are supposed to be spent with the people who care about you."
Soos says: "But you know what, that dude didn’t care about me enough to visit me once, let alone fight monsters through time and space like you dudes."
Soos says: "I mean, you had a gladiator fight, just to make me happy."
Soos says: "I've been being ridiculous this whole time."
Soos says: "Whoever my dad was, he can take a hike."
Soos says: "Thanks for giving me the best birthday ever."
Blendin says: "Are you kidding me?!"
Blendin says: "!"
Blendin says: "Do you have any idea what you’ve just wasted?!"
Blendin says: "!"
Blendin says: "Do you how many have died to get the time wish; the wars that were started?!"
Blendin says: "!"
Soos says: "Oh that’s not all dude."
Soos says: "And it can do that for like..."
Soos says: "infinity."
Dipper says: "Oh yeah, okay, cool."
Blendin says: "Okay, yeah."
Blendin says: "Phew."
Blendin says: "That’s a good time wish!"
Soos says: "There’s still ten minutes before Laser Tag closes."
Soos says: "You dudes wanna play?"
Dipper says: "Yeah."
Dipper, Mabel and Soos run into Laser Tag zone, laughing.
Dipper says: "Happy birthday, Soos!"
Mabel says: "Happy birthday, Soos!"
Cut to Credits Scene. It is 2002 and Soos is in his backyard.
Soos says: "Whoa."
Soos says: "Though I heard an explosion."
Soos says: ""Mystery Shack."
Cut to Mystery Shack says: "Stan:  "That is it!"
Cut to Mystery Shack says: "You are singlehandedly the worst handyman I've ever seen."
Soos says: "Uh, hey."
Soos says: "Excuse me sir."
Stan says: "Hey you, gumdrop."
Stan says: "Think you can fix a golf cart?"
Soos says: "Well, uh."
Stan says: "Step right up to the Mystery Shack folks, step right up..."
