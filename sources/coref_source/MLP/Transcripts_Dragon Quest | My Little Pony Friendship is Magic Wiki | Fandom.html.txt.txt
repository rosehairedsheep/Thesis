Twilight Sparkle says: "C'mon, Fluttershy, it'll be fun!"
Fluttershy says: "There's nothing fun about dragons!"
Fluttershy says: "Scary, yes!"
Fluttershy says: "Fun, no!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But Fluttershy, the great dragon migration happens only once in a generation!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Do you really wanna pass up a chance like that?"
Fluttershy says: "Now that you put it that way, yes!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Aw, Fluttershy, we just don't want you to miss out."
Fluttershy says: "Miss out on what?"
Fluttershy says: "Dragons?"
Fluttershy says: "Big, scaly, fire-breathing dragons?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "yeah!"
Fluttershy says: "Thanks, but..."
Fluttershy says: "no thanks!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Look, Fluttershy, I watched that boring butterfly migration with you, so now it's your turn to watch the dragon migration with me!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You owe me!"
Fluttershy says: "I..."
Fluttershy says: "said..."
Fluttershy says: "no!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeaagh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay, I guess I'll let you off the hook this time."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't see any dragons."
Applejack says: "Me neither."
Pinkie Pie says: "Me neither neither."
Rainbow Dash says: "Shoot!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You don't think we missed them, do you?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, I don't think so."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We're just a little early, and I'm glad we are."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This way, we can watch every moment of the migration without bringing any unwanted attention to ourselves!"
Rarity says: "Yoo-hoo!"
Rarity says: "Well?"
Rarity says: "What do you think?"
Rarity says: "Am I the toast of the trench or what?"
Applejack says: "You'll be toast alright, when the dragons see you parading around in that getup."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You look very nice, Rarity, but could you maybe look nice down here in the trench with us?"
Rarity says: "Nice is an understatement."
Rarity says: "I look fabulous!"
Rarity says: "Who says camouflage has to be drab?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ahoy, maties!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Dragons ho!"
Main cast says: "Oooh..."
Main cast says: "ahhhh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wow, amazing!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pfft, pretty lame move."
Rainbow Dash says: "Is that all they've got?"
Applejack says: "What do ya think of that 'move', Rainbow Dash?"
Applejack says: "Still think they're lame?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, not so much."
Rainbow Dash says: "The word 'fierce' comes to mind."
Rarity says: "And 'formidable'."
Pinkie Pie says: "And 'super-duper scary'!"
Spike says: "Yeah."
Spike says: "Us dragons are definitely a force to be reckoned with."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, right, Spike."
Rainbow Dash says: "That's one of the scariest aprons I've ever seen!"
Spike says: "What's wrong with wearing an apron?"
Spike says: "You won't be laughing when you spill blueberries all over your scales—"
Spike says: "feathers."
Spike says: "That's one tough stain!"
Rainbow Dash says: "One tough stain against one lame dragon."
Rarity says: "You leave him alone, Rainbow Dash!"
Rarity says: "Spike's style is unique."
Rarity says: "He doesn't have to look like other dragons."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Or act like them."
Rarity says: "My little Spikey-wikey is perfect the way he is."
Spike says: "I don't act like other dragons?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, not even close!"
Applejack says: "But why would you want to, Spike?"
Rarity says: "Yes."
Rarity says: "You've got something those dreadfully fierce dragons can only dream of."
Spike says: "What's that?"
Rarity says: "The cutest widdle chubby cheeks!"
Rarity says: "Ooooo!"
Spike says: "Cute?!"
Spike says: "!"
Spike says: "Dragons aren't supposed to be cute!"
Spike says: "Right?"
Rarity says: "Oh, sweetie, you are turning the most delightful shade of red."
Rarity says: "It is most becoming."
Spike says: "Rrrgh!"
Rarity says: "Oh, isn't he adorable when he waddles off in anger?"
Spike says: "Waddle?!"
Spike says: "!"
Spike says: "Rrrrrggggh!"
Spike says: "What am I?"
Spike says: "Where am I from?"
Spike says: "Who am I supposed to be?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uuugh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't know!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "For the last time, Spike, you were given to me as an egg."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't know who found you or where they found you."
Spike says: "Seriously?"
Spike says: "That's all you know?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm sorry, Spike."
Spike says: "That doesn't tell me anything about who I am!"
Spike says: "I need answers!"
Spike says: "I feel like I'm..."
Spike says: "I'm looking at a complete stranger."
Spike says: "Oh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why don't we do some late-night research?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "See what we can find out."
Spike says: "Really?"
Spike says: "You'd do that?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Of course!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm sure we can find something."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nothing."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nothing in this one either!"
Spike says: "Nothing at all about dragons?"
Spike says: "This is getting ridiculous!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's hard to believe, but ponies know next to nothing about dragons."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Apparently they're too rare and too scary to try to talk to or study!"
Spike says: "I wonder if dragons cry..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Aw, Spike."
Spike says: "It's okay, Twilight."
Spike says: "I'm gonna discover who I am if it's the last thing I do!"
Rarity says: "Yoo-hoo!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, guys!"
Spike says: "Waugh!"
Rarity says: "Good morning!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ya wanna join us for breakfast?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That sounds great."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm famished."
Spike says: "Count me out."
Spike says: "I've gotta get an early start!"
Rarity says: "An early start?"
Spike says: "Yes!"
Spike says: "I'm going on a quest of self-discovery!"
Spike says: "I need to learn what it means to be a dragon!"
Spike says: "And the only way I'm gonna do that is to join the dragon migration!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What?!"
Rarity says: "What?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "?"
Rarity says: "?"
Rainbow Dash says: "?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Spike, that's nonsense talk!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I know that you're a dragon, but those dragons mean business!"
Rainbow Dash says: "They're big, and tough, and scary..."
Spike says: "And I'm small, and meek..."
Spike says: "and I like to wear aprons."
Spike says: "See?"
Spike says: "This is exactly why I need to spend time with them."
Rainbow Dash says: "All I'm saying is that you could get hurt."
Rarity says: "Darling, this time I really do have to agree with Rainbow Dash."
Rarity says: "I don't want those big, ugly, nasty dragons to hurt one little scale on your cutesy-wutesy head!"
Spike says: "I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind."
Rarity says: "Oh, uh, quick, do something!"
Rarity says: "Stop him before it's too late!"
Spike says: "Ngh!"
Spike says: "Hey!"
Spike says: "Give it back!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hold it!"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Aaagh!"
Spike says: "Really?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't tell me you think he should go?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I couldn't answer your questions."
Twilight Sparkle says: "My books couldn't either."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I understand why you want to look elsewhere."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I truly believe you need to go on this quest."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And we have no right to stop you."
Rarity says: "I suppose not."
Rainbow Dash says: "I still say you're nutty, but hey, I've done lots of nutty things."
Rarity says: "We know."
Spike says: "We know."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We know."
Rainbow Dash says: "Rrgh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well then, I guess this is goodbye, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We can't wait to hear about it when you return."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Quest."
Rainbow Dash says: "–your quest answers some of your pesky "Who am I?"
Rainbow Dash says: "" questions."
Spike says: "Thanks, everypony."
Spike says: "I know it will."
Rarity says: "Goodbye, Spikey-wikey!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Go get 'em, big guy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We have faith in you!"
Rarity says: "We're following him, right?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Of course."
Spike says: "Ugh!"
Spike says: "Nngh..."
Spike says: "Alright, teenage dragons!"
Spike says: "Now that's more my speed."
Spike says: "And size."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm telling you, we'll never pass for a real dragon!"
Rarity says: "Oh, pish-posh!"
Rarity says: "This costume is fabulous, one of my finer creations."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Shh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We'll never pass if they hear three voices coming out of one dragon!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now come on, let's go!"
Spike says: "Um, excuse me?"
Spike says: "Uh, hi."
Spike says: "I'm Spike."
Fume says: "You sure your name is Spike and not Shrimp?!"
Fume says: "!"
Spike says: "No, it's Spike!"
Spike says: "I'm not, I mean, I'm sure about that..."
"Clump" says: "You look more like Peewee to me."
Garble says: "Hey guys, c'mon, seriously."
Garble says: "Leave him alone or he might fly away."
Garble says: "That is, uh, if he had any wings!"
"Clump" says: "You fly in on your mommy's back during the migration?"
Spike says: "Not exactly..."
Fume says: "No, no, can't you see baby Spike just hatched?"
Fume says: "I bet he still sucks his claw at night!"
Spike says: "No, I haven't sucked my claw in months!"
Garble says: "Well, if you weren't just hatched, how come we haven't seen you around before?"
Garble says: "Hahaha!"
Garble says: "Ponyville?"
Garble says: "That explains it!"
Garble says: "I knew there was something vaguely pony-ish about you!"
Garble says: "If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were part pony!"
Spike says: "Who, me?"
Spike says: "I'm not part pony!"
Spike says: "I'm all dragon, see?"
Spike says: "Raar!"
Garble says: "Or maybe you're a pony in a dragon costume."
Fume says: "A pony in a dragon costume..."
Fume says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Aheh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "yeah..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "hilarious."
Spike says: "Nnh, I am a real dragon!"
Garble says: "Oh, yeah?"
Garble says: "Prove it."
Spike says: "Well..."
Spike says: "how?"
Garble says: "By acting like one!"
Garble says: "Who's up for a little belching contest?"
Garble says: "You think you can beat that, Peewee?"
Teenage dragons says: "Huh?"
Garble says: "From the desk of Princess Celestia."
Garble says: "Dear Spike, please te– Ha!"
Garble says: "Get this, guys!"
Garble says: "Spike's pen-pals with a namby-pamby pony princess!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "How can he just throw that away?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That letter could be something important!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We can't worry about that now, Twilight."
Rainbow Dash says: "We're here to help Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know, I know!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "There's no reason to disrespect Princess Celestia that way!"
Garble says: "Maybe tail wrestling is more your speed."
Spike says: "Uh..."
Teenage dragons says: "Yeah!"
Garble says: "Ready..."
Garble says: "go!"
Garble says: "The winner!"
Spike says: "Good old tail wrestling..."
Rarity says: "We can't let little Spikey-wikey wrestle one of them!"
Rarity says: "He'll get clobbered!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's go!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I challenge Spike to a tail wrestle!"
Garble says: "Who's this weirdo?"
Fume says: "I think he's Crackle's cousin."
Crackle says: "BWAAGH!"
Garble says: "Oh, that would explain it."
Garble says: "Ready?"
Garble says: "Go!"
Garble says: "Spike's the winner!"
Garble says: "Nice going, little Spike!"
Garble says: "Maybe you are a dragon after all!"
Spike says: "Yeah!"
Spike says: "Maybe I am!"
Rarity says: "Rainbow Dash, I can't believe your silly plan actually worked."
Rarity says: "Ow."
Spike says: "Alright, who's next?"
Garble says: "Getting a little cocky, huh?"
Garble says: "I like that."
Garble says: "So how about you wrestle..."
Garble says: "him!"
Garble says: "Go!"
Spike says: "Whooooooooa!"
Garble says: "So, Spike, you haven't exactly proven yourself as a dragon yet, have you?"
Spike says: "But..."
Spike says: "I get an A for effort?"
Garble says: "Huh, maybe."
Garble says: "Let's see how you do in this next contest."
Spike says: "Whaaaaa!"
Spike says: "Oof!"
Spike says: "Wha!"
Spike says: "Oah!"
Spike says: "Oof!"
Garble says: "King of the hoard!"
Spike says: "This is my chance."
Rainbow Dash says: "Not so fast!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oof!"
"Clump" says: "Whoa!"
Garble says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "King of the ho- whoa!"
Spike says: "Oof!"
Spike says: "Uh!"
Spike says: "Nuh!"
Spike says: "Oof!"
Garble says: "Looks like this is another fail for you, little Spike."
Garble says: "Can't wait to watch you fail at lava cannonball, too."
Garble says: "Whoever makes the biggest lava splash is the ultimate dragon!"
Garble says: "Geronimo!"
Spike says: "Nuh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike's on his own this time."
"Clump" says: "Cannonball!"
Spike says: "Guh!"
Garble says: "What's wrong, Spike?"
Garble says: "You afraid the lava will hurt your soft pony hide?"
Teenage dragons says: "Oooh..."
Spike says: "Ugh..."
Spike says: "was I..."
Spike says: "that bad?"
Garble says: "No, dude, that was awesome!"
Garble says: "No pony could live through a belly flop like that!"
Garble says: "You're one tough little dragon."
Garble says: "Spike, by belly flopping so hard, you have proven yourself worthy."
Garble says: "I hereby dub you 'rookie dragon', and will now perform the initiation ritual."
Garble says: "Rrrrgh."
Garble says: "Now let's party dragon style!"
Spike says: "Man, was that a great party."
Garble says: "Great?"
Garble says: "Huh, maybe by Ponyville standards."
Garble says: "Stick with us, Spike."
Garble says: "We still got plenty to teach you about being a dragon."
Spike says: "I'm not going anywhere."
Spike says: "The way I feel right now, I could hang out with you guys forever."
Rainbow Dash says: "Forever?!"
Rarity says: "Forever?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Forever?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rarity says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Rarity says: "Spikey-wikey is going to stay with these awful dragons?"
Rarity says: "Forever?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh no, this is terrible!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I should've stopped him back at the library when I had the chance!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, Rainbow Dash, this is all my fault!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I encouraged him to go!"
Garble says: "Y'know, Spike, I think you just might be ready for a real dragon raid."
Garble says: "There's a nest full of phoenix eggs nearby, and we're gonna swipe 'em!"
"Clump" says: "Aren't you totally psyched to go on this raid?"
Spike says: "Oh yeah, I'm excited."
Spike says: "I mean, I'm psyched."
Garble says: "Alright then."
Garble says: "Let's fly!"
Spike says: "Uh, sorry, guys!"
Spike says: "I guess I'll meet you back here at the crater!"
Spike says: "After the whole raid thing's over?"
Spike says: "We'll totally hang then!"
Spike says: "Whoahoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh no, they took Spike!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We've gotta go after them!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash, stop!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We can't fly!"
Rarity says: "And you're ruining my fabulous costume!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm sorry, but we gotta help Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, we're just gonna have to hoof it!"
Garble says: "Alright, Spike."
Garble says: "Since you're our rookie dragon, you get to lure the parents away from the nest."
Spike says: "Heh..."
Spike says: "lucky me..."
Garble says: "Well go on, then!"
Spike says: "Hey, Mr."
Spike says: "and Mrs."
Spike says: "Phoenix!"
Spike says: "I was hoping I could have a word with you?"
Spike says: "Um, I'd, um, like to ask you some questions actually..."
Garble says: "We haven't got all day, Spike!"
Spike says: "Hey, you bird brains!"
Spike says: "Come and get me!"
Garble says: "What the..."
Fume says: "The eggs have hatched."
"Clump" says: "What do we do now?"
Garble says: "We take the hatchlings, of course!"
Garble says: "Get 'em!"
Garble says: "Ohh..."
Garble says: "get them!"
Garble says: "Nnnghh..."
Teenage dragons says: "Ugh!"
Garble says: "Nnngh, they got away!"
Garble says: "I hate that!"
Teenage dragons says: "Oof!"
Spike says: "Huh, what have we got here?"
Spike says: "What happened?"
Garble says: "They got away!"
Garble says: "Hey!"
Garble says: "You stole an egg?"
Spike says: "Uh..."
Garble says: "Well, I guess the raid wasn't a total waste after all."
Garble says: "Nice going, Spike."
"Clump" says: "Well, what are you waiting for, Spike?"
"Clump" says: "Smash it!"
Spike says: "Smash the egg?"
"Clump" says: "Yeah!"
Fume says: "Yeah, throw it on the ground as hard as you can!"
Teenage dragons says: "Yeah!"
Teenage dragons says: "Smash it!"
Teenage dragons says: "Smash it!"
Teenage dragons says: "Smash it!"
Teenage dragons says: "Smash it!"
Teenage dragons says: "Smash it!"
Spike says: "No!"
Spike says: "It's just a defenseless egg, like I was!"
Spike says: "And I'm not gonna let you hurt it!"
Garble says: "What did you say?"
Spike says: "I said no."
Garble says: "No one says no to me."
Rainbow Dash says: "Nopony's gonna lay a claw on him!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's right!"
Rarity says: "Fighting's not really my thing, I'm more into fashion, but I'll rip you to pieces if you touch one scale on his cute little head!"
Garble says: "Ooh, scary, hehe!"
Garble says: "Spike, are these namby-pamby ponies your friends?"
Spike says: "Yes, they are."
Spike says: "And they're better friends than you could ever be."
Spike says: "Now, if you don't back off, you'll see what us ponies do when confronted by a huge group of jerky dragons."
Garble says: "Oh, yeah?"
Garble says: "What's that?"
Spike says: "Run away!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nyuh!"
Spike says: "Phew, that was a close one."
Spike says: "Thanks, you guys."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Of course."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are friends for?"
Spike says: "You're more than friends."
Spike says: "You're my family."
Seeing the great dragon migration made me wonder what it meant to be a dragon. But now I realize that who I am is not the same as what I am. I may have been born a dragon, but Equestria and my pony friends have taught me how to be kind, loyal, and true! I'm proud to call Ponyville my home, and to have my pony friends as my family.
Yours truly,.
Spike.
Spike says: "Aww."
Spike says: "Hey, welcome to the family, Peewee!"
Spike says: "Stick with me."
Spike says: "I've got plenty to teach you about being a pony."
