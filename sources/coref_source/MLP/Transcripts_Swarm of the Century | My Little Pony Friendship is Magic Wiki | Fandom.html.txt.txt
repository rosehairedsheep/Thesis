Fluttershy says: "La, la la, la la, la la, la la."
Fluttershy says: "Thank you little squirrel, but remember: these flowers are for Princess Celestia."
Fluttershy says: "Only the prettiest ones will do."
Fluttershy says: "La, la la, la la, la la, la la."
Fluttershy says: "Gah!"
Fluttershy says: "Hello, little guy."
Fluttershy says: "I've never seen anything like you before."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, are you hungry?"
Fluttershy says: "Here you go."
Fluttershy says: "I guess you were hungry."
Fluttershy says: "You're the cutest thing ever!"
Fluttershy says: "I can't wait to show you to my friends."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hurry up, Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This place isn't gonna clean itself."
Spike says: "It also didn't mess itself up."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow!"
Spike says: "I thought this was just an unofficial casual visit."
Twilight Sparkle says: "There's nothing casual about a visit from royalty."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I want this place to be spotless, and you've barely made a dent in the clutter."
Spike says: "Maybe you should, ugh, start reading them one at a time-- whoa ho!"
Spike says: "Aw."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Everything's got to be perfect."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No time for fooling around."
Spike says: "You know, this would be an awful lot easier if there weren't two of us here getting under each other's feet."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Great idea."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You clean, I'll go see how everyone else's preparations are coming."
Spike says: "Or maybe I should..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What happened to the rest of her name?"
Golden Harvest says: "We couldn't fit it all in."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You can't hang a banner that says "Welcome Princess Celest"."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Take it down and try again."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That looks perfect."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Keep up the good work."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hello, Mr."
Twilight Sparkle says: "and Mrs."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Cake."
Twilight Sparkle says: "How's the banquet coming?"
Mrs. Cake says: "Uh..."
Mrs. Cake says: "it would be coming a little better if..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Mmm..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are you doing?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Those sweets are supposed to be for the princess."
Pinkie Pie says: "I know."
Pinkie Pie says: "That's why I'm tasting them."
Pinkie Pie says: "Somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue, and I, Pinkie Pie, declare that these treats are fit for a king, or a queen, or a princess."
Fluttershy says: "Twilight, Pinkie, you won't believe..."
Fluttershy says: "oh, I'm sorry."
Fluttershy says: "Uh, am I interrupting?"
Pinkie Pie says: "No, not at all."
Pinkie Pie says: "Come on in and make yourself at home."
Pinkie Pie says: "What's going on, Fluttershy?"
Fluttershy says: "You won't believe what I found at the edge of the Everfree Forest."
Fluttershy says: "Come on out, little guy."
Fluttershy says: "It's okay."
Fluttershy says: "Three?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "They're amazing."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are they?"
Fluttershy says: "I'm not sure."
Fluttershy says: "I'm also not sure where these other two came from."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll take one off your hooves."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've never seen anything so..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "adorable."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Besides, it'll be nice to have a companion for Spike so he won't bother me so much while I'm studying."
Fluttershy says: "Pinkie, do you want the other one?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ugh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "A parasprite?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Are you kidding?"
Fluttershy says: "Ugh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "A para-what?"
Fluttershy says: "How could you not like..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ugh."
Pinkie Pie says: "Now I gotta go find a trombone."
Twilight Sparkle says: "A what?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ahhh, typical Pinkie."
Rarity says: "Stand still, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh, I caaan't, I need to flyyy!"
Rainbow Dash says: "This is waaay too boring for me."
Rarity says: "Do you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wow."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous."
Rarity says: "Mmhmm."
Rarity says: "Thank you, Twilight."
Rarity says: "Nice to know someone appreciates my talents."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh, sooo boooring."
Rarity says: "Huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "What's that sound, Twilight?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wow, what are they?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The better question is, where did they come from?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I only had one a minute ago."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, I'll take one."
Rarity says: "Me too."
Rarity says: "Oh, they're perfect."
Pinkie Pie says: "Does anypony know where I can find an accordion?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Girls!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hello!"
Pinkie Pie says: "This is important."
Pinkie Pie says: "Durgh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Thanks a lot."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The decorations, the banquet, I really hope everything comes together in time for tomorrow."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh,  what's there to worry about?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wake up!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What happened?"
Spike says: "Huh?"
Spike says: "Whaaa!"
Spike says: "What's going on?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where did they come from?"
Spike says: "I don't know."
Spike says: "The little guy got hungry in the night, so I gave him a snack, but..."
Spike says: "I have no idea where these others came from."
Spike says: "Oh no!"
Spike says: "They're messing up all my hard work!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The princess will be here in a few hours."
Spike says: "Ugh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, help me round up these little guys."
Spike says: "Ugh, what does it look like I'm doin'?"
Spike says: "Ooow, waaah!"
Spike says: "D'oh."
Spike says: "I know, I know, "stop fooling around"."
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Waaa!"
Rarity says: "Not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful."
Rarity says: "Oh!"
Rarity says: "Are you okay?"
Rarity says: "Aaah!"
Rarity says: "Eewww."
Rarity says: "Aaah!"
Rarity says: "Gross gross gross!"
Rarity says: "No creature that behaves so revoltingly is allowed in my boutique!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Look Rarity, Applejack loaned me a harmonica."
Pinkie Pie says: "Isn't that great?"
Pinkie Pie says: "And not a moment too soon."
Rarity says: "Ugh, Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now."
Pinkie Pie says: "And I'm not?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You know how many more instruments I've gotta find?"
Pinkie Pie says: "A lot, that's how many."
Pinkie Pie says: "Now if we split the list between us, we might just make it in time."
Rarity says: "Please, Pinkie, I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt."
Rarity says: "I've got a real problem."
Pinkie Pie says: "You've got a real problem, all right."
Pinkie Pie says: "And a banjo is the only answer!"
Rarity says: "I see we're having the same problem."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ditto!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy knows everything about animals, I'm sure she can tell us how to stop them from multiplying."
Twilight Sparkle says: "..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "or not."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh, do something Fluttershy, can't you control them?"
Fluttershy says: "I've tried everything I know."
Fluttershy says: "I've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching, and asking politely, and..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Guh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If we can't get them under control before the princess arrives, it'll be a total disaster."
Rarity says: "Ew!"
Rarity says: "If you ask me, it's already a total disaster."
Applejack says: "Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy, but I still can't figure why y'need so many."
Applejack says: "Hey!"
Fluttershy says: "What do we do?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I got it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nopony can herd like Applejack."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We can drive 'em back into the forest."
Applejack says: "I'll rastle 'em up, but I need everypony's help to do it."
Applejack says: "Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there."
Applejack says: "I'll herd the little critters straight at ya like a funnel."
Applejack says: "Rainbow Dash, you and Fluttershy stay on top of 'em, don't let 'em fly away."
Rainbow Dash says: "Aye aye."
Applejack says: "Yeeeeeee-haw!"
Applejack says: "Alright y'all, here goes nothin'."
Applejack says: "Look out Rarity, that one's fixin' to get away."
Applejack says: "Keep a lead on 'em, Rainbow Dash!"
Applejack says: "Hold on girls, we're almost there."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Twilight, we don't have much time."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're telling me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The princess could arrive at any moment."
Pinkie Pie says: "Exactly."
Pinkie Pie says: "That's why I need you gals to drop what you're doing and help me find some maracas."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Maracas?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas."
Pinkie Pie says: "You're right!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Getting a tuba has to be our number one goal."
Pinkie Pie says: "Follow me."
Pinkie Pie says: "I said, follow me!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie Pie, you are so random."
Pinkie Pie says: "And you are all so stubborn!"
Applejack says: "Forget her ladies."
Applejack says: "Focus."
Applejack says: "Head 'em up and move 'em out."
Rainbow Dash says: "All right!"
Fluttershy says: "Ouch."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We did it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nice work, Applejack."
Applejack says: "Couldn't a'done it without y'all."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now let's get back and clean up the mess they made before the princess arrives."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, everyone knows what to do, right?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where did they come from?"
Fluttershy says: "Well, I may have kept just one."
Fluttershy says: "Heh."
Fluttershy says: "I couldn't help myself."
Fluttershy says: "They're just so cute."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We don't have time to keep rounding up these things."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What do we do now?"
Rainbow Dash says: "We call in the weather patrol."
Rainbow Dash says: "Time to take out the adorable trash."
Rainbow Dash says: "YAAAAAA!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Way to go, Rainbow Dash!"
Applejack says: "Looks like our problems are solved."
Pinkie Pie says: "They will be with these cymbals."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Give me those back!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yaa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yow!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wow!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I can't hold it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "She's breaking up."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie Pie, what have you done?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals, that's what I've done."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Will you forget about your silly instruments for one second?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville."
Pinkie Pie says: "Me?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ruin?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm not the ruiner, I'm the ruin-ee!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Or is it ruiness?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ruinette?"
Applejack says: "Come on girls, there's no reasoning with that one."
Applejack says: "She's a few apples short of a bushel."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm trying to tell you all that the ruining is on the other hoof."
Pinkie Pie says: "If you'd just slow down and listen to me!"
Gardening pony says: "Aah!"
Fluttershy says: "What do we do?"
Fluttershy says: "They're eating all the food in town."
Applejack says: "My apples!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We've gotta do something."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I got it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll cast a spell to make them stop eating all the food."
Pinkie Pie says: "Look, tambourines!"
Pinkie Pie says: "If you could all just..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, it worked."
Rainbow Dash says: "They're not eating the food anymore."
Rarity says: "Oh no..."
Rarity says: "if they get inside my store..."
Rarity says: "Everypony for herself!"
Rarity says: "My outfits!"
Rarity says: "Go on, shoo!"
Rarity says: "Get out of here, you naughty!"
Rarity says: "Naughty!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'll save you!"
Applejack says: "No woodland creature's gonna eat the Apple Family's crop."
Applejack says: "Brace yourself, y'all, here they come!"
Applejack says: "Didn't see that one comin'."
Spike says: "Help!"
Spike says: "Help..."
Zecora says: "Ugh."
Zecora says: "Have you gone mad?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Zecora, these little guys are devouring Ponyville, and the princess is on her way."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Can you help us, please?"
Zecora says: "Oh, monster of so little size."
Zecora says: "Is that a parasprite before my eyes?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't know!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Is it?"
Zecora says: "Tales of crops and harvests consumed."
Zecora says: "If these creatures are in Ponyville, you're doomed."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh no, here she comes."
Daisy says: "Aaaah, aaaaaaah!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, here's the plan."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash, you distract them."
Rainbow Dash says: "YAAAA!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Good."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Everyone else, we need to build an exact copy of Ponyville right over there."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We've got less than a minute."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Zecora was right, we're doomed."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh no, the princess's procession is here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's all over!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We're in the middle of a crisis here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is no time for your..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "nonsense?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Look."
Princess Celestia says: "Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hello, princess."
Princess Celestia says: "So lovely to see you again, as well as your friends."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "how was the trip?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hit much traffic?"
Princess Celestia says: "Ah, what is this?"
Princess Celestia says: "Oh ho ho, these creatures are adorable."
Rainbow Dash says: "They're not that adorable."
Princess Celestia says: "I'm terribly honored that you and the good citizens of Ponyville have organized a parade in honor of my visit."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Parade?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes, the parade."
Princess Celestia says: "Unfortunately, that visit is going to have to wait for another time."
Princess Celestia says: "I'm afraid an emergency has come up in Fillydelphia."
Princess Celestia says: "Apparently there's been some sort of infestation."
Twilight Sparkle says: "An..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "infestation?"
Princess Celestia says: "Yes, a swarm of incredibly bothersome creatures has invaded the poor town."
Princess Celestia says: "I'm sorry Twilight, to have to put you all through so much trouble."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Trouble?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What trouble?"
Princess Celestia says: "Before I have to go, would you care to give me your latest report on the magic of friendship in person?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "My..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "report?"
Princess Celestia says: "Haven't you learned anything about friendship?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Actually, I have."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least expect it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's a good idea to stop and listen to your friends' opinions and perspectives..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Even when they don't always seem to make sense."
Princess Celestia says: "I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle, and I'm very impressed with your friends as well."
Princess Celestia says: "It sounds like you're all learning so much from each other."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thank you, princess."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, what happened to the princess?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Emergency in Fillydelphia."
Rainbow Dash says: "Some sort of infestation."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh no!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Have they got parasprites too?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, have tuba, will travel."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I think the princess can handle it."
Applejack says: "So you knew what those critters were all along, huh Pinkie Pie?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, duh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Why do you think I was so frantic to get my hooves on all these instruments?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I tried to tell you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We know, Pinkie Pie, and we're sorry we didn't listen."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're a great friend, even if we don't always understand you."
Pinkie Pie says: "Thanks guys, you're all great friends too, even when I don't understand me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia, and more importantly, you saved Ponyville."
Twilight Sparkle says: "..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Or not."
