Apple Bloom says: "Where are you takin' us?"
Applejack says: "We're almost there, young'uns."
Sweetie Belle says: "I've never been here before."
Scootaloo says: "Ouch!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh."
Apple Bloom says: "Sorry."
Scootaloo says: "Are we there yet?"
Sweetie Belle says: "There?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Where?"
Sweetie Belle says: "What?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I don't even know what we're doing."
Applejack says: "Here we are."
Apple Bloom says: "What are we lookin' at?"
Scootaloo says: "I have no idea."
Sweetie Belle says: "What is that thing?"
Applejack says: "Cutie Mark Crusaders, welcome to your new clubhouse."
Applejack says: "Well, don't thank me all at once."
Applejack says: "This was my clubhouse when I was your age."
Applejack says: "Sure it hasn't been used in a while, but it's empty and on a secluded, private part of the farm."
Applejack says: "And it's all yours."
Applejack says: "It just needs a little, uh..."
Applejack says: "TLC."
Scootaloo says: "TLC as in Tender Loving Care or Totally Lost Cause?"
Apple Bloom says: "Applejack!"
Apple Bloom says: "We're supposed to turn this into our new clubhouse?"
Applejack says: "Well, maybe y'all will get your cutie marks when you discover your talent for..."
Applejack says: "waaah!"
Applejack says: "Uh..."
Applejack says: "house cleanin'?"
Granny Smith says: "Soup's on!"
Apple Bloom says: "Whoa!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hi, Scootaloo!"
Apple Bloom says: "Back already?"
Apple Bloom says: "You're amazin' on that scooter."
Scootaloo says: "Thanks!"
Scootaloo says: "Wow, Apple Bloom."
Scootaloo says: "You did all of this?"
Apple Bloom says: "Yep!"
Apple Bloom says: "I've fixed the broken shutters, sanded off the splinters, rebuilt the roof, painted..."
Scootaloo says: "That's so cool."
Scootaloo says: "What's Sweetie Belle up to?"
Sweetie Belle.
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders... humming.
Apple Bloom says: "There you are, Sweetie Belle!"
Apple Bloom says: "See?"
Apple Bloom says: "I told you we could find her by following her totally awesome voice."
Scootaloo says: "What's that sweet tune you're singing?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh."
Sweetie Belle says: "I was just working on our new Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song."
Apple Bloom says: "Cool!"
Scootaloo says: "Cool!"
Scootaloo says: "Teach us?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, I've only come up with one part..."
Sweetie Belle says: "but okay!"
Sweetie Belle.
They all say that you will get your mark.
When the time is really right.
Apple Bloom.
And you know just what you're supposed to do.
Scootaloo.
Applejack says: "Well, uh..."
Applejack says: "I'll be, Cutie Mark Crusaders."
Applejack says: "You've done one fine job with this place."
Applejack says: "So, what's next?"
Apple Bloom says: "Well, now that we have a real life clubhouse..."
Scootaloo says: "..."
Scootaloo says: "and a map of Ponyville..."
Sweetie Belle says: "..."
Sweetie Belle says: "and a Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song..."
Applejack says: "Theme song?"
Apple Bloom says: "We're gonna go out in the world and discover our talents."
Scootaloo says: "A new adventure!"
Sweetie Belle says: "And earn our cutie marks."
Apple Bloom says: "We'll leave no stone unturned!"
Scootaloo says: "No mountain unclimbed!"
Sweetie Belle says: "No meal uncooked!"
Apple Bloom says: "No sock unworn!"
Applejack says: "Well okay then!"
Applejack says: "Sounds like you have a plan."
Applejack says: "I gotta, uh..."
Applejack says: "leave no apple unpicked!"
Applejack says: "See y'all later!"
Scootaloo says: "Are we ready to get our cutie marks, ponies?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Ready!"
Spike says: "I had nothing to do with this."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What is going on here?"
Apple Bloom says: "Hmm..."
Apple Bloom says: "well, we sure aren't gettin' our cutie marks for bein' librarians."
Spike says: "Huh."
Spike says: "I should think not."
Spike says: "What?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Girls, I think you're going about this the wrong way."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Instead of trying to do things in areas you're not familiar with, why not try doing things in areas that you already like?"
Cheerilee says: "And I have the perfect place to start."
Apple Bloom says: ""Showcase your talents..."
Scootaloo says: ""..."
Scootaloo says: "for all to see."
Sweetie Belle says: ""Perform in the Ponyville school talent show!"
Cheerilee says: "There'll be all sorts of awards."
Cheerilee says: "Best dramatic performance, best comedy act, best magic act..."
Cheerilee says: "surely you can find your talent."
Apple Bloom says: "This would be the perfect place to discover our talents."
Apple Bloom says: "Jugglin'!"
Scootaloo says: "Acting!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Magic tricks!"
Apple Bloom says: "Square dancin'!"
Scootaloo says: "Tightrope walking!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Tiger taming!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "My little ponies!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're missing the point."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Think about the things you already enjoy doing."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Think about what you're already good at."
Scootaloo says: "Sure!"
Scootaloo says: "We can do that."
Sweetie Belle says: "Yeah!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Sure we can."
Apple Bloom says: "Well, whatever we do, we'll do it as..."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "..."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "The Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Rarity says: "Sweetie Belle!"
Rarity says: "I told you not to touch my things."
Rarity says: "Come back with my supplies!"
Sweetie Belle says: "We're just borrowing them for the talent show."
Sweetie Belle says: "Don't worry, sis."
Sweetie Belle says: "I promise we'll bring them back."
Scootaloo says: "Thanks, Mr."
Scootaloo says: "Breezy."
Scootaloo says: "We'll return the fan to you real soon."
Apple Bloom says: "What do we need this fan for?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Trust me on this one."
Scootaloo says: "Okay, so that's six wooden planks, four-by-eight plywood, a box of nails, four cans of paint, and four brushes."
Scootaloo says: "Anything else?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Yeah."
Sweetie Belle says: "Instructions on how to use six wooden planks, four-by-eight plywood, a box of nails, four cans of paint, and four brushes."
Twilight Sparkle says: ""Ghosts, Goblins and Ghoulish Figures"?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Good heavens, girls."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What do you need a book like this for?"
Scootaloo says: "You'll see."
Scootaloo says: "Thanks, Twilight."
Scootaloo says: "We'll give it back as soon as we're done with it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What do you think they're up to?"
Spike says: "I have no idea and I don't know if I should be excited or scared to find out."
Apple Bloom says: "I'm glad we're doin' this as a team."
Sweetie Belle says: "Me too."
Sweetie Belle says: "Um..."
Sweetie Belle says: "so what are we doing again?"
Scootaloo says: "A super awesome dramatic song for the talent show, of course."
Sweetie Belle says: "Right!"
Sweetie Belle says: "With super-cool scenery."
Sweetie Belle says: "And amazing costumes!"
Apple Bloom says: "And mind-blowin' dance moves."
Scootaloo says: "This is gonna be soo amazing!"
Apple Bloom says: "Sweetie Belle, I think you should be a singer."
Sweetie Belle says: "What?"
Sweetie Belle says: "No way I'm singing in front of a crowd."
Sweetie Belle says: "Twilight said to do something we like to do, and I'd like to be like my big sister, and she's a designer."
Scootaloo says: "Fine then."
Scootaloo says: "You can do the costumes and the scenery."
Apple Bloom says: "And Scootaloo, you're great in maneuvers on your scooter."
Apple Bloom says: "So you should do the choreography."
Apple Bloom says: "Y'know, all those dance moves."
Scootaloo says: "Nah."
Scootaloo says: "I'd rather sing a wicked rock ballad."
Scootaloo says: "Why don't you come up with the dance routine, Apple Bloom?"
Apple Bloom says: "Hm..."
Apple Bloom says: "I'm not much of a dancer..."
Apple Bloom says: "but I do like Kung-fu."
Apple Bloom says: "That's kinda like dancin'."
Apple Bloom says: "Hi-ya!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hah!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hah!"
Apple Bloom says: "Yah!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Then it's settled!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Let's get started."
Apple Bloom says: "One..."
Apple Bloom says: "two..."
Apple Bloom says: "three..."
Apple Bloom says: "oh!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh!"
Scootaloo says: "Ow, Apple Bloom!"
Scootaloo says: "What are you doing?"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, I feel like I have four left feet."
Apple Bloom says: "I can't even spin right."
Scootaloo says: "Don't be silly."
Scootaloo says: "You just gotta keep your head forward until the very last minute, like this."
Scootaloo says: "See?"
Scootaloo says: "Easy-peasy."
Scootaloo says: "You just gotta practice a bunch, that's all."
Apple Bloom says: "Wow!"
Apple Bloom says: "That does look easy."
Apple Bloom says: "Thanks."
Apple Bloom says: "Okay."
Apple Bloom says: "Let's try this again."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh!"
Apple Bloom says: "Ouch!"
Apple Bloom says: "Ow."
Apple Bloom says: "I'm okay!"
Scootaloo says: "Keep practicing!"
Apple Bloom says: "Will do."
Scootaloo says: "We fight the fight, walk the walk."
Scootaloo says: "Talk the talk, eat the..."
Scootaloo says: "uh..."
Scootaloo says: "food like a celery stalk?"
Scootaloo says: "Ugh!"
Scootaloo says: "I'll never come up with anything!"
Scootaloo says: "Never, never, never!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Come back!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Come back!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Uh."
Sweetie Belle says: "Dumb fabric."
Sweetie Belle says: "Hey, Scoot!"
Sweetie Belle says: "How's the song going?"
Scootaloo says: "Pbbbt."
Sweetie Belle says: "Pbbbt?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh my!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Sounds serious."
Scootaloo says: "I'm just no good at lyrics."
Scootaloo says: "Coming up with words is, like..."
Scootaloo says: "really hard."
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh, it can't be that bad."
Sweetie Belle says: ""With our cutie marks we'll rock Equestria."
Sweetie Belle says: "We use our stomachs to..."
Sweetie Belle says: "digestia"?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Umm..."
Sweetie Belle says: "well..."
Sweetie Belle says: "these are..."
Sweetie Belle says: "um..."
Sweetie Belle says: "good, but..."
Sweetie Belle says: "how about after "we fight the fight"..."
There is nothing that we fear.
We'll have to figure out what we'll do next.
Scootaloo says: "Wow!"
Scootaloo says: "That's so awesome!"
Scootaloo says: "Did you just come up with that now?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Yeah..."
Sweetie Belle says: "kind of."
Scootaloo says: "Thanks, I'm totally using that."
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh no!"
Sweetie Belle says: "One, two, three, four, five?"
Apple Bloom says: "Ouch!"
Sweetie Belle says: "How's the spin coming along?"
Apple Bloom says: "I think I gotta just stick to punches and kicks."
Apple Bloom says: "You know, ponies only have four legs."
Sweetie Belle says: "I'll never be a designer like my sister Rarity."
Apple Bloom says: "Hey, it's no big deal."
Apple Bloom says: "Why don't you use the dress form?"
Apple Bloom says: "It'll help you with your patterns and help you put all the pieces in the right places."
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh, is that what that's for?"
Apple Bloom says: "Uh..."
Apple Bloom says: "maybe you should also clean your paintbrush between each color."
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh, I was wondering why all the colors looked like mud."
Apple Bloom says: "You're not using power tools, are you?"
Applejack says: "The talent show is just around the corner."
Applejack says: "I wonder how the fillies are doin'."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh!"
Apple Bloom says: "Sorry, Scootaloo."
Scootaloo says: "That's okay."
Scootaloo says: "Ugh!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Oops!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Sorry, Scootaloo."
Sweetie Belle says: "Ouch!"
Scootaloo says: "Oh, my bad, Sweetie Belle."
Scootaloo says: "Let's sing the chorus again!"
Applejack says: "Well, gosh."
Applejack says: "Sure wasn't expectin' that."
Apple Bloom says: "I think that sounded pretty good."
Sweetie Belle says: "Me too."
Sweetie Belle says: "You think we're ready?"
Scootaloo says: "Ready as we'll ever be."
Scootaloo says: "Hey!"
Scootaloo says: "Did you see us practicing?"
Applejack says: "Uh..."
Applejack says: "yeah."
Apple Bloom says: "Well?"
Apple Bloom says: "How'd we do?"
Apple Bloom says: "How'd we do?"
Applejack says: "Uh..."
Scootaloo says: "Speechless!"
Scootaloo says: "See, girls?"
Scootaloo says: "I told you that's what we're gonna do."
Scootaloo says: "We're gonna leave them speechless."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Yay!"
Applejack says: ""Speechless" is right."
Snips says: "..."
Snips says: "And, on the count of three, this rabbit will disappear, and something tasty will reappear in its place."
Snips says: "A one, a two, and a three!"
Snips says: "Hey!"
Snips says: "Where are they?"
Snips says: "Snails, where are the..."
Snips says: "carrots."
Snips says: "SNAILS!"
Cheerilee says: "Uh, how about a round of applause for the S&S magic act?"
Cheerilee says: "Now for our next act, we have Sunny Daze and Peachy Pie reciting their favorite poem..."
Cheerilee says: "on roller skates!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Break a leg!"
Apple Bloom says: "Sweetie Belle!"
Apple Bloom says: "What a thing to say!"
Sweetie Belle says: "No, no, no."
Sweetie Belle says: "You see, in the theater it's considered bad luck to say "good luck"."
Sweetie Belle says: "So you say "break a leg" instead."
Twilight Sparkle says: "My little ponies!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "How are you doing?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Nervous..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Don't worry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're gonna be amazing."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Remember, just stick to what you know best."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can't wait to hear you sing, Sweetie Belle."
Sweetie Belle says: "Why does everypony always think I'm gonna sing?"
Scootaloo says: "Actually, Twilight Sparkle, I'm the main singer tonight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh?"
Apple Bloom says: "And I'm the main dancer."
Apple Bloom says: "Hi-ya!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh?"
Sweetie Belle says: "And I'm in charge of..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Costumes?"
Sweetie Belle says: "And sets and props."
Sweetie Belle says: "How'd you know?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Really, girls?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Are you sure..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "?"
Cheerilee says: "Cutie Mark Crusaders, you're on next."
Cheerilee says: "Break a leg."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Break a le—"
Apple Bloom says: "Ugh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "good luck!"
Scootaloo.
Look, here, are three little ponies,.
Ready to sing for this crowd,.
Listen up, 'cause here's our story.
I'm gonna sing it.
Cutie Mark Crusaders.
Very loud!
Scootaloo.
When you're a younger pony.
And your flank is very bare.
Feels like the sun will never come.
When your cutie mark's not there.
So the three of us will fight the fight.
There is nothing that we fear.
We'll have to figure out what we'll do next.
Cutie Mark Crusaders.
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders.
On a quest to find out who we are.
And we will never stop the journey.
Not until we have our cutie marks.
Scootaloo.
They all say that you'll get your mark.
When the time is really right.
And you know just what you're supposed to do.
And your talent comes to light.
But it's not as easy as it sounds.
And that waiting's hard to do.
So we test our talents everywhere.
Cutie Mark Crusaders.
Until our face is blue.
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders.
On a quest to find out who we are.
And we will never stop the journey.
Not until we have our cutie marks.
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders.
On a quest to find out who we are.
And we will never stop the journey.
Not until we have our cutie marks!
Scootaloo says: "Wow."
Scootaloo says: "That did not go as well as I expected."
Apple Bloom says: "I can't believe they're laughin' at us."
Sweetie Belle says: "Was it that bad?"
Cheerilee says: "Back on stage, girls."
Cheerilee says: "It's time for the awards."
Sweetie Belle says: "Back on stage?"
Sweetie Belle says: "No."
Apple Bloom says: "They'll just laugh some more."
Scootaloo says: "Yeah, what's the point?"
Cheerilee says: "Now girls, let's be good sports."
Cheerilee says: "You made a great effort."
Cheerilee says: "You should be proud."
Cheerilee says: "Now come on!"
Cheerilee says: "Let's hear it for all our talented fillies and colts."
Cheerilee says: "Our first award goes to..."
Cheerilee says: "Snips and Snails for best magic act."
Snips says: "Hey!"
Snips says: "Mine's at least shinier."
Snails says: "Well, mine's bigger."
Snips says: "Oh yeah, well..."
Snips says: "well, mine is, um..."
Snips says: "heavier?"
Cheerilee says: "The next award goes to..."
Cheerilee says: "Sunny Daze and Peachy Pie for best dramatic performance."
Cheerilee says: "And finally, the last award of the night goes to..."
Cheerilee says: "the Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "What?"
Cheerilee says: "For best comedy act."
Apple Bloom says: "Can you believe it?"
Apple Bloom says: "We won!"
Scootaloo says: "I knew our act was awesome."
Sweetie Belle says: "You know what would be the best?"
Sweetie Belle says: "If we won and we got our cutie marks."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Congratulations, ponies!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Job well done."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Thanks, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey, you don't sound too excited."
Scootaloo says: "We worked really hard and won a prize, but we still don't have our cutie marks."
Sweetie Belle says: "Which is the prize we really wanted."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, girls..."
Apple Bloom says: "But we think we know why."
Sweetie Belle says: "Yes."
Sweetie Belle says: "We know why."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Tell me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'd love to make a special report to the Princess."
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, maybe we were trying too hard."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And?"
Scootaloo says: "And instead of forcing ourselves to do something that's not meant for us..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes?"
Apple Bloom says: "We each should be embracing our true talent!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And that is..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Comedy!"
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom!"
Applejack says: "You did it!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Did you see our award?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Weren't we funny?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "One day..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "one day..."
