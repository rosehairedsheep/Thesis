Silverstream says: "See?!"
Silverstream says: "!"
Silverstream says: "New posters!"
Silverstream says: "We never had those underwater!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I won't keep you in suspense any longer."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We're bringing one of Ponyville's oldest traditions to our school – the Fetlock Fete."
Smolder says: "The what-lock what?"
Sandbar says: "It's a pony dance party!"
Sandbar says: "They're the best!"
Ocellus says: "I'm ready!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You don't need to do that, Ocellus."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This year, the event's at school and open to everycreature."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We're calling our dance the Amity Ball."
Ocellus says: "Even better!"
Yona says: "Yona not know Amity Ball dance."
Yona says: "Yona only know traditional dance of Yakyakistan."
Yona says: "Go like this!"
Yona says: "Ball dance like that?"
Sandbar says: "Not exactly."
Sandbar says: "It isn't just one dance."
Sandbar says: "It's a whole night of them."
Sandbar says: "Plus an awesome party!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And we'll have all the old Fetlock Fete traditions – the Pony Pal Contest, the lucky pot dinner."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You'll love it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "So, like this says, "get your pony pal and come along."
Smolder says: "Want to go?"
Smolder says: "I've got nothing better to do."
Gallus says: "You had me at "dinner"."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now, who wants to help me hang more posters?"
Silverstream says: "Me!"
Ocellus says: "Sure!"
Sandbar says: "Hey, Yona, want to be my pony pal?"
Sandbar says: "We can enter the contest together."
Yona says: "But Yona yak."
Yona says: "Yona not pony."
Sandbar says: "So?"
Yona says: "Pony, pony, more pony."
Sandbar says: "Aw, that's just a poster."
Sandbar says: "Come on!"
Sandbar says: "It'll be tons of fun together."
Sandbar says: "Promise."
Yona says: "Okay."
Yona says: "Yona go with Sandbar."
Sandbar says: "Great!"
Sandbar says: "I'll get the tickets."
Sandbar says: "See you later!"
Yona says: "Yona not let Sandbar down!"
Yona says: "Yak best at being pony pal!"
Yona says: "But Yona not sure how if she not pony."
Rarity says: "Ooh!"
Rarity says: "Oh, terribly sorry, Yona."
Rarity says: "All these dresses I'm sewing for the dance have me completely frazzled."
Yona says: "Dress?"
Yona says: "Yona need dress for dance?!"
Yona says: "!"
Yona says: "Yona have lots to learn about being best pony pal."
Yona says: "Yona interrupting?"
Rarity says: "Oh."
Rarity says: "Now, what can I do for you, Yona?"
Yona says: "Yona not know yak need special pony dress for dance."
Yona says: "Yona no can wear what Yona always wear?"
Rarity says: "Yona could—"
Rarity says: "I mean, you could."
Rarity says: "But the Fetlock Fete or whatever Twilight is calling it – it's all about a tradition."
Rarity says: "There's a certain way to do everything at the dance."
Yona says: "Yes!"
Yona says: "That what Yona want to learn!"
Yona says: "How to do all the pony things, even if Yona has to wear dress."
Rarity says: "Well, uh, y-y-yes, if that's what you really want."
Yona says: "Mm-hmm!"
Yona says: "Yona be best pony pal for Sandbar!"
Rarity says: "In that case, at an elegant affair like a pony dance, one must converse in a sophisticated fashion."
Rarity says: "Talking with Brussels sprouts in your mouth helps you to learn to  Take a mouthful, and repeat after me."
Rarity says: "How kind of you to ask me to tea."
Yona says: "How kind of you to ask me to tea."
Rarity says: "May I offer you a glass of punch?"
Yona says: "May I offer you a glass of punch?"
Rarity says: "The weather is quite agreeable today."
Yona says: "Yona like Brussels sprouts!"
Rarity says: "Let's move on."
Rarity says: "We will need to do something about your hairstyle."
Rarity says: "But first, let's find the right dress!"
Rarity says: "Now, purple taffeta, frosted chiffon..."
Rarity says: "Gold brocade!"
Rarity says: "One of my favorites!"
Yona says: "Yona like brown."
Rarity says: "Blech..."
Rarity says: "Earth tones."
Rarity says: "They're so..."
Rarity says: "..."
Rarity says: "earthy, aren't they?"
Rarity says: "Don't worry."
Rarity says: "We shall find something to make you stand out."
Yona says: "Yona not want to stand out."
Yona says: "Yona want to fit in."
Rarity says: "Quite."
Rarity says: "And by the time we're through, it'll be like you've been going to pony dances your whole life."
Rarity.
The more you know how things are done.
The more confident you'll be.
There's more to a dance than just having fun.
And there's no better teacher than me.

Yona says: "Oh."
Yona says: "Yona already have pony pal."
Rarity says: "Oh, not that, darling."
Rarity says: "The dancing!"
Rarity says: "And I know precisely who can help!"
Yona says: "Uh..."
Yona says: "Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy good at dancing?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't be so surprised."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm awesome at everything!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Except for baking."
Fluttershy says: "There are two traditional dances that everypony does at the Fete."
Fluttershy says: "After a few days of practicing with us, you'll know them both."
Yona says: "And fit right in!"
Rarity says: "Absolutely."
Rarity says: "We'll start with the slow dance, the Pony Cotillion."
Rarity says: "That's Fluttershy's specialty."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, , I wouldn't say specialty."
Fluttershy says: "It's just fun."
Fluttershy says: "Here, Yona."
Fluttershy says: "I made you a chart."
Fluttershy says: "All you have to do is follow these dance steps."
Fluttershy says: "You'll learn them in no time."
Fluttershy says: "Now, just start walking."
Fluttershy says: "Step on whatever color I name."
Fluttershy says: "Let's begin."
Fluttershy says: "Blue, red, step ahead."
Fluttershy says: "Green, black, now step back."
Fluttershy says: "Now you try."
Yona says: "Blue, red, step—"
Yona says: "ah, oh!"
Yona says: "No."
Yona says: "Um, Yona start over."
Yona says: "Blue, red, green, black, yak step back?"
Fluttershy says: "Good!"
Fluttershy says: "Now,  black, green, red, and blue."
Fluttershy says: "Red, black, hold one and two."
Fluttershy says: "Red, blue, red once more."
Fluttershy says: "Green, black, blue, red, three and four."
Fluttershy says: "Ooh."
Fluttershy says: "Um, maybe we should try this again later."
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't worry, Yona."
Rainbow Dash says: "That was the hard one."
Rainbow Dash says: "Mine's way easier."
Rainbow Dash says: "A little dance called the Pony Prance!"
Rainbow Dash says: "The key to this one is speed!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on, Yona, try it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Just get with the flow and let yourself go!"
Rarity says: "Oh, my!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa there!"
Yona says: "Yona like to flow and go!"
Applejack says: "Welcome to Sweet Apple Acres, Yona."
Applejack says: "Rarity tells us you need some help gettin' ready for the big dance."
Rarity says: ""Some"."
Rarity says: "Ha!"
Rarity says: "Indeed."
Rarity says: "And we only have a few more days."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, you've come to the right place."
Pinkie Pie says: "Because if you asked me what my favorite part of the dance is, I'd say everything about the dance!"
Pinkie Pie says: "But especially..."
Pinkie Pie says: "this!"
Pinkie Pie says: "The Fetlock lucky pot dinner!"
Applejack says: "It's part of the Ponyville dance tradition."
Applejack says: "Everypony brings a dish to share, and we swap 'em without knowin' whose is whose."
Applejack says: "Although my lucky pot probably gives me away."
Pinkie Pie says: "You can cook anything you want!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Like, can I suggest, oh, I don't know, maybe..."
Pinkie Pie says: "cupcakes?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Rarity says: "Uh, I already told Yona a little bit about that tradition."
Rarity says: "She's even brought her own lucky..."
Rarity says: "bucket."
Yona says: "Yak buckets are best buckets."
Yona says: "Yona think make traditional yak dish – tree-root stew!"
Yona says: "Extra fiber."
Yona says: "Mmmm."
Yona says: "Ponies like?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hmm, I'm not sure."
Pinkie Pie says: "So, just in case, let's get baking!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Flour, milk, sugar, butter, icing."
Pinkie Pie says: "Then we mix, and we beat, and we pour into pans."
Pinkie Pie says: "We bake..."
Pinkie Pie says: "And now you try it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, that's one way to mix it."
Applejack says: "Let's try somethin' a little simpler."
Applejack says: "I'm sure we can do somethin' with these."
Yona says: "Yah!"
Applejack says: "O-kay."
Applejack says: "Applesauce it is."
Yona says: "Blue, red, green..."
Yona says: "whoa!"
Yona says: "Blue..."

Yona says: "Red, blue, red once more."
Yona says: "Green, black, blue, red, three and four!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Look!"
Rainbow Dash says: "She's dancing!"
Applejack says: "How 'bout that?"
Applejack says: "And she's good!"
Rarity says: "Yona, if someone at the party tells you they're thirsty, you say..."
Yona says: "May Yona—"
Yona says: "um..."
Yona says: "May I offer you a cup of punch?"
Rarity says: "By Celestia, I think she's got it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "She's really got it!"
Applejack says: "Yona, you did it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You dance great!"
Fluttershy says: "And are so well spoken!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You'll be the hit of the ball!"
Rarity.
You've mastered so many pony ways.
And grown a lot in the past few days.
You've shown a turn that has earned our praise.
Yona.
And now I fit right...
Rarity and Yona.
Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Applejack, and Pinkie Pie.
You fit right in!
Spike says: "Hello, everycreature!"
Spike says: "I'm your DJ, Scales-n-Tail, spinning your favorite tunes all night long!"
Spike says: "So welcome to the Fetlock Fet—"
Spike says: "I mean, the Amity Ball!"
Gallus says: "I'm just glad I'm here with you guys."
Gallus says: "Least I'm not the only non-pony in the crowd."
Sandbar says: "You're not still worried about that, are you?"
Sandbar says: "Like Headmare Twilight said, this is a dance for everycreature."
Sandbar says: "There's no pony pressure."
Ocellus says: "You should've told Yona that."
Sandbar says: "Uh, what do you mean?"
Silverstream says: "Didn't you hear?"
Silverstream says: "Our teachers have been helping her get ready for the dance!"
Silverstream says: "She's been taking lessons."
Smolder says: "She's gone full pony for the dance."
Gallus says: "All for you."
Sandbar says: "For me?"
Sandbar says: "Why?"
Yona says: "How kind of you to ask me to this soiree, Sandbar."
Gallus says: "Uhh..."
Ocellus says: "Uhh..."
Silverstream says: "Uhh..."
Smolder says: "Uhh..."
Smolder says: "What?"
Silverstream says: "You look so weird!"
Sandbar says: "Yona?!"
Sandbar says: "!"
Yona says: "Quite."
Yona says: "Oh, I do hope I make a good pony pal for you."
Sandbar says: "Uh, of course you do."
Sandbar says: "But, Yona, you didn't need to do any of..."
Sandbar says: "this."
Smolder says: "And why are you talking so funny?"
Yona says: "I am not "talking funny"."
Yona says: "I'm fitting in."
Gallus says: "Could've fooled me."
Rarity says: "Yona!"
Rarity says: "You look absolutely scrumptious, darling."
Rarity says: "Uh, why don't I get that for you?"
Sandbar says: "You made a lucky pot?"
Yona says: "Precisely like ponies prepare!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Welcome, everycreature, to our school's first annual Amity Ball!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "For those of you who've never attended a Fetlock Fete, we can't wait to show you some of our fun traditions on this special night!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "So, Spike..."
Spike says: "Uh, Scales-n-Tail?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's get this party started!"
Spike says: "Oh, yeah, party ponies!"
Spike says: "It's time to raise the roof and stomp your hoof for the traditional first dance of the night, the Pony Cotillion!"
Yona says: "Ah!"
Yona says: "Yona know this one!"
Sandbar says: "You do?"
Yona says: "Indeed!"
Yona says: "Green, black, then step back."
Yona says: "Shall we?"
Sandbar says: "Wow!"
Sandbar says: "How did you learn this?"
Yona says: "I had good teachers."
Yona says: "Whoa!"
Sandbar says: "Yona!"
Sandbar says: "Are you alright?"
Yona says: "Yona never practice dance with dress on."
Yona says: "Uh..."
Yona says: "may I offer you a cup of punch?"
Spike says: "Time to shake things up a little!"
Spike says: "That's right, everycreature!"
Spike says: "It's the Pony Prance!"
Sandbar says: "Uh, maybe we should sit this one out."
Yona says: "No!"
Yona says: "I do so love the Pony Prance!"
Sandbar says: "Ah!"
Sandbar says: "It's okay, Yona!"
Smolder says: "Just stop bouncing!"
Gallus says: "We got you!"
Gallus says: "Ah!"
Yona says: "Wig..."
Yona says: "come..."
Yona says: "off!"
Rarity says: "What a calamitous yak-ccident!"
Sandbar says: "Yona!"
Ocellus says: "What happened?!"
Ocellus says: "!"
Silverstream says: "Are you all right?"
Yona sad...
Yona sing sad song...
Sad Yona...
Yona says: "Yona no blame bird."
Yona says: "Yona no want to be around Yona either."
Yona sad...
Yona sing sad song...
Sandbar says: "Yona?"
Yona says: "How Sandbar find Yona?"
Sandbar says: "I know you pretty well by now."
Sandbar says: "I figured you'd come here."
Sandbar says: "Besides, it's where I'd go if something like that happened to me."
Yona says: "Sandbar mean something awful and embarrassing."
Yona says: "So awful, Yona cannot come down from treehouse ever!"
Yona says: "Will Sandbar bring Yona food and water?"
Sandbar says: "You know, it really wasn't that bad."
Sandbar says: "I don't think anycreature hardly even noticed."
Sandbar says: "Well, maybe one or two didn't."
Sandbar says: "If they happened to be in Canterlot for the day."
Sandbar says: "But anyway, it's all over now, so..."
Sandbar says: "will you come back to the dance with me?"
Yona says: "Yona disappoint Sandbar."
Yona says: "Yona not make very good pony."
Sandbar says: "Why would you think you disappointed me?"
Sandbar says: "And who said anything about having to be a good pony?"
Yona says: "Yona just want to do all the right pony things and fit in at dance!"
Yona says: "Then maybe Sandbar and Yona win best pony pals contest."
Yona says: "Instead, Yona win worst pony ever."
Sandbar says: "That's not true."
Yona says: "Really?"
Yona says: "Sandbar, name two ponies worse than Yona."
Sandbar says: "Cozy Glow and Sombra."
Yona says: "Okay, Sandbar right."
Yona says: "They worse."
Sandbar says: "Yona, it doesn't really matter if you're a great pony or a horrible pony."
Sandbar says: "You're the best Yona I know."
Sandbar says: "That's why I asked you to the dance."
Yona says: "Really?"
Sandbar says: "I never wanted you to be anything other than what you are."
Sandbar says: "My friend, Yona, the yak."
Sandbar says: "So, what do you say?"
Sandbar says: "Let's go back to the dance?"
Sandbar says: "Don't worry."
Sandbar says: "I'm with you."
Gallus says: "We all are."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yona!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Are you all right?"
Fluttershy says: "We were so worried when you disappeared like that."
Yona says: "Yona fine, but..."
Yona says: "Yona sorry."
Yona says: "Not mean to make such a mess and ruin the pony dance."
Applejack says: "It's not your fault, sugarcube."
Rainbow Dash says: "It's the opposite."
Rainbow Dash says: "If anything, we should be apologizing."
Pinkie Pie says: "I thought we were just teaching you how to have fun at the dance."
Rarity says: "We never meant to try to turn you into something you're not."
Yona says: "Is okay."
Yona says: "Friend help Yona feel better."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And that's why we're giving you this."
Sandbar says: "Huh?"
Yona says: "Huh?"
Sandbar says: "No way!"
Sandbar says: "The Pony Pal prize!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "From now on, it's the annual Amity Ball Award for Friendship!"
Applejack says: "No pony-ness required."
Rainbow Dash says: "We all decided you and Yona totally earned this."
Rarity says: "Your actions tonight exemplify the true meaning of friendship."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Congratulations, you two!"
Spike says: "Yona!"
Spike says: "I'm glad you're back!"
Spike says: "Everypony wants to learn that crazy dance you did!"
Yona says: "Yak dance?"
Yona says: "Is easy!"
Yona says: "Yona teach..."
Yona says: "if everycreature want to learn?"
Rarity says: "It would be an honor."
Spike says: "You asked for it, and DJ Scales-n-Tail is gonna deliver!"
Spike says: "Everycreature join Yona for..."
Spike says: "the Yakyakistan Stomp!"
