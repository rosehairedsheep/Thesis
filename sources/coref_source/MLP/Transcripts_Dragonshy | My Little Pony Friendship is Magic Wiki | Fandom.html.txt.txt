Fluttershy says: "Oh, goodness."
Fluttershy says: "Are you okay?"
Fluttershy says: "Are you coughing because there's a carrot stuck in your throat?"
Fluttershy says: "Because you need some water?"
Fluttershy says: "Because of that giant cloud of scary black smoke?"
Fluttershy says: "I'll take that as a..."
Fluttershy says: "yes."
Fluttershy says: "Help."
Fluttershy says: "Help!"
Fluttershy says: "Please?"
Fluttershy says: "Help?"
Fluttershy says: "There's- there's a horrible cloud of smoke."
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't be such a scaredy-pony."
Rainbow Dash says: "It's just me, future Equestria ball-bouncing record holder."
Rainbow Dash says: "Three forty six, three forty seven..."
Pinkie Pie says: "This calls for a celebration!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, no, Pinkie Pie, this is no time for celebration."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooo!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm going to need balloons!"
Pinkie Pie says: "One for every pony in Ponyville!"
Fluttershy says: "There's- there's smoke."
Fluttershy says: "And- and where there's smoke, there's fire."
Pinkie Pie says: "Let's see, that's one, two, three, four..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Three hundred fifty four..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Five, six..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Three hundred fifty five, no, wait..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Seven."
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie Pie!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Now I have to start over."
Fluttershy says: "We're all going to have to start over, in a new village."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, Rainbow Dash, wait up!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, please, this is an emergency."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Listen up!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Smoke is spreading over all of Equestria."
Ponies says: "What?"
Ponies says: "Oh no!"
Ponies says: "That's awful!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But don't worry, I've just received a letter from Princess Celestia informing me that it is not coming from a fire."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, thank goodness."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's coming from a dragon."
Fluttershy says: "A..."
Fluttershy says: "d-dragon?"
Applejack says: "What in the name of all things cinnamon swirled is a full-grown dragon doing here in Equestria?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sleeping."
Applejack says: "Huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh?"
Rarity says: "Huh?"
Fluttershy says: "Huh?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "According to Princess Celestia, he's taking a nap."
Twilight Sparkle says: "His snoring is what's causing all this smoke."
Pinkie Pie says: "He should really see a doctor."
Pinkie Pie says: "That doesn't sound healthy at all."
Rarity says: "Well, at least he's not snoring fire."
Rarity says: "What are we meant to do about it?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'll tell you what we're meant to do."
Rainbow Dash says: "Give him the boot."
Rainbow Dash says: "Take that."
Rainbow Dash says: "And that!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We need to encourage him to take a nap somewhere else."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Princess Celestia has given us this mission, and we must not fail."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If we do, Equestria will be covered in smoke for the next one hundred years."
Rarity says: "Hmph."
Rarity says: "Talk about getting your beauty sleep."
Twilight Sparkle says: "All right everypony, I need you to gather supplies quickly."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We've got a long journey ahead of us."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's meet back here in less than an hour."
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay, girls, you heard her."
Rainbow Dash says: "The fate of Equestria is in our hooves."
Rainbow Dash says: "Do we have what it takes?"
Fluttershy says: "Um, actually..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Raaah!"
Applejack says: "Yaaa!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, I mean, grrr!"
Rarity says: "Ewww!"
Rarity says: "Much better."
Rarity says: "Onward!"
Applejack says: "Let's go!"
Fluttershy says: "Um, let's..."
Fluttershy says: "not?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "All right girls, listen up."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm mapping out the fastest route, but we've all got to keep a good pace if we expect to make it up the mountain by nightfall."
Fluttershy says: "M-m-mountain?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The dragon is in that cave at the very top."
Applejack says: "Looks pretty cold up there."
Rainbow Dash says: "You bet it is."
Rainbow Dash says: "The higher you go, the chillier it gets."
Rarity says: "Good thing I brought my scarf."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooo!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pretty!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh, oh yeah."
Rainbow Dash says: "That'll keep you nice and cozy."
Fluttershy says: "Um, excuse me, Twilight?"
Fluttershy says: "I know you're busy, but..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh-huh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, we could go this way."
Fluttershy says: "But if I could just have a second..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh-huh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, we want to avoid that."
Fluttershy says: "So, um, I was thinking that, um, maybe I should just stay here in Ponyville."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh-huh."
Fluttershy says: "Oh!"
Fluttershy says: "Good."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wait!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You have to come!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Your way with wild animals will surely come in handy."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, and don't worry about your little friends in the meadow."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike's got it covered while you're gone."
Spike says: "You can count on me!"
Spike says: "Oooh!"
Spike says: "Hey!"
Spike says: "Hey!"
Spike says: "Wait!"
Fluttershy says: "I don't really think he's up to the task."
Fluttershy says: "Maybe..."
Fluttershy says: "but..."
Fluttershy says: "but..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Are you sure you want Fluttershy to come along?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I mean, that pony's afraid of her own shadow."
Rainbow Dash says: "She's just going to slow us down."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, she's just a little nervous."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Once we get going, I'm sure she'll be fine."
Twilight Sparkle says: "All right girls, move out!"
Fluttershy says: "But..."
Fluttershy says: "but..."
Fluttershy says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa."
Rainbow Dash says: "What was that?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That is what it sounds like when a dragon snores."
Fluttershy says: "It- it's so..."
Fluttershy says: "high!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, it is a mountain."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm going to fly up there and check it out!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wah!"
Applejack says: "Hold on, now."
Applejack says: "I think we should all go up together."
Applejack says: "Safety in numbers and all."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, all right."
Rarity says: "I hear the only thing that sparkles more than a dragon's scales are the jewels they use to build their nests."
Rarity says: "Ooo, if I play my cards right, I might be able to convince him to part with a few!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Girls!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is no laughing matter!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy, you're the expert on wild creatures."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What do you think the dragon will be like?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What are you waiting for?"
Rainbow Dash says: "An invitation?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooo, I think I have one in my bag!"
Fluttershy says: "I-it's so..."
Fluttershy says: "so..."
Fluttershy says: "steep."
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, it is a cliff."
Rainbow Dash says: "You could just, oh, I don't know, fly up here?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Come on, Fluttershy, you can do it."
Pinkie Pie says: "Flap those wings!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh..."
Fluttershy says: "okay."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh, we don't have time for this."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are you doing?"
Applejack says: "I'll need this if I'm going to take her around the mountain another way."
Rainbow Dash says: "Around the mountain?"
Rainbow Dash says: "That's going to take them forever."
Applejack says: "Don't worry, Twi."
Applejack says: "We'll be there lickety-split."
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I win again!"
Rarity says: "Ugh."
Rarity says: "That's thirty-five games in a row."
Rarity says: "Best of seventy-one?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Told you it was going to take them forever."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Your turn, Fluttershy."
Fluttershy says: "But..."
Fluttershy says: "it's so..."
Fluttershy says: "wide."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Come on, Fluttershy, we should be much farther along by now."
Applejack says: "You could just leap on over."
Fluttershy says: "I don't know."
Pinkie Pie says: "There's nothing to be afraid of."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's just a hop, skip and a jump."
Pinkie Pie says: "See?"
Pinkie Pie.
It's not very far.
Just move your little rump.
You can make it if you try with a hop, skip and jump.
Twilight Sparkle says: "We don't have time for this."
Pinkie Pie.
A hop, skip and jump,.
Just move your little rump,.
A hop, skip and jump,.
A hop, skip and jump,.
A hop, skip and jump,.
A hop skip and jump,.
A hop skip and jump!
Fluttershy says: "O-okay."
Fluttershy says: "Here I go."
Fluttershy says: "A hop."
Applejack says: "That's it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You've got it."
Rarity says: "Almost there."
Fluttershy says: "Skip."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Just don't look down."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh."
Fluttershy says: "I guess I forgot to jump."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's keep it down."
Twilight Sparkle says: "According to my map, we're entering an avalanche zone."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The smallest peep could cause a huge rock slide."
Fluttershy says: "An..."
Fluttershy says: "an ava..."
Fluttershy says: "ava..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Shhh!"
Fluttershy says: "AVALA-!"
All ponies says: "Avalanche!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh no!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Help!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ooh!"
Applejack says: "Oh my!"
Applejack says: "Everypony okay?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thanks to you I am."
Rarity says: "Eugh."
Rarity says: "Blech."
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Let's do it again!"
Rarity says: "Uh!"
Rarity says: "This is why a girl always packs extra accessories."
Rarity says: "Oh, please tell me I brought the tiara that goes with this."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, think we got bigger problems than making sure our hair bows match our horseshoes."
Fluttershy says: "Sorry."
Applejack says: "Aw, no big whoop, sugarcube."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yeah, we'll just have to  climb over."
Applejack says: "Wha!"
Applejack says: "Wha..."
Rarity says: "My apologies."
Rainbow Dash says: "Not your fault."
Rainbow Dash says: "Still think it was a good idea to bring Fluttershy along?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We're about to find out."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We're here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash, you'll use your wings to clear the smoke."
Rainbow Dash says: "Mm-hmm."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rarity and Pinkie Pie, you'll create a diversion to distract the dragon if things get a little hairy in there."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack, you're ready with the apples in case he decides to attack."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But it shouldn't come to that, because Fluttershy will do what she needs to do to wake him up, and between the two of us, we should be able to get him to understand why he needs to go."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Is everypony ready?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay then, we're goin' in."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So, what is the best way to wake up a sleeping dragon without upsetting him?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, come on!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Come on!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "smoke."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ooh!"
Fluttershy says: "I- I- I can't go in the cave."
Ponies says: "Ugh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, great."
Rainbow Dash says: "She's scared of caves now, too."
Fluttershy says: "I'm not scared of caves, I'm scared of."
Applejack says: "What's that, sugarcube?"
Fluttershy says: "I'm scared of."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What?"
Fluttershy says: "I'm scared of dragons!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But Fluttershy."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You have a wonderful talent dealing with all kinds of animals."
Fluttershy says: "Yes, because they're not dragons."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh come on!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We've seen you walk right up to a horrible manticore like it was nothing."
Fluttershy says: "Yes, because he wasn't a dragon."
Pinkie Pie says: "Spike is a dragon."
Pinkie Pie says: "You're not scared of him."
Fluttershy says: "Yes, because he's not a huge, gigantic, terrifying, enormous, teeth-gnashing, sharp-scale having, horn-wearing, smoke-snoring, could eat a pony in one bite, totally all grown-up dragon!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But, if you're so afraid of dragons, why didn't you say something before we came all the way up here?"
Fluttershy says: "I was afraid to."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh."
Applejack says: "All of us are scared of that dragon."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm not!"
Applejack says: "Almost all of us are scared of that dragon, but we've got a job to do."
Applejack says: "So, get in there with Twilight and show her what you're made of."
Fluttershy says: "I- I- I just..."
Fluttershy says: "can't."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Fluttershy."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm goin' in."
Twilight Sparkle says: "He..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "probably just doesn't realize what he's doing..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "right?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Mr."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Dragon."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Excuse me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Mr."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Dragon."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, good, you're awake."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Please allow me to introduce myself."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Augh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Puh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sparkle, and my friends and I are residents here in Equestria."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ponyville, to be exact."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We've come here to ask that you find another spot to take your nap."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's just that you seem to be doing an awful lot of snoring, and every time you do you send out a terrible cloud of smoke."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Equestria simply can't survive a hundred years in a dark haze."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You understand, don't you?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "So, you'll find another place to sleep?"
Rainbow Dash says: "So much for  persuading him."
Applejack says: "Now what?"
Rarity says: "But I couldn't possibly head back home without mentioning what handsome scales you have."
Rarity says: "And those scales have to be hidden away in some silly cave for a hundred years?"
Rarity says: "Personally, I think you should skip the snoozing and be out there, showing them off."
Rarity says: "Hmm."
Rarity says: "Obviously, I would be more than happy to keep an eye on your jewels while you're gone."
Rarity says: "I was this close to getting that diamond."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You mean..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "getting rid of that dragon?"
Rarity says: "Oh, yeah..."
Rarity says: "sure."
Applejack says: "What in tarnation..."
Applejack says: "?"
Rarity says: "Darling, you look ridiculous."
Pinkie Pie says: "Exactly!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Sharing a laugh is a sure-fire way to get someone on your side!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hi!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Apparently he doesn't like laughing, heh."
Pinkie Pie says: "Or sharing."
Rainbow Dash says: "All right, that's it."
Rainbow Dash says: "We tried persuasion, charm, whatever it is Pinkie Pie does."
Rainbow Dash says: "It's time to stop wasting time!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm going in!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow, no!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Get!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Out!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Sorry."
Rainbow Dash says: "Who-o-o-o-o-a!"
Ponies says: "Ugh!"
Fluttershy says: "How dare you..."
Fluttershy says: "How dare you!"
Fluttershy says: "Listen here, mister."
Fluttershy says: "Just because you're big doesn't mean you get to be a bully!"
Fluttershy says: "You may have huge teeth, and sharp scales, and snore smoke, and breathe fire."
Fluttershy says: "But you do not—"
Fluttershy says: "I repeat—"
Fluttershy says: "you do not!"
Fluttershy says: "Hurt!"
Fluttershy says: "My!"
Fluttershy says: "Friends!"
Fluttershy says: "You got that?"
Fluttershy says: "Well?"
Razer says: "But that rainbow one kicked me."
Fluttershy says: "And I am very sorry about that."
Fluttershy says: "But you're bigger than she is, and you should know better."
Fluttershy says: "You should also know better than to take a nap where your snoring can become a health hazard to other creatures."
Fluttershy says: "Don't you 'but I' me, mister."
Fluttershy says: "Now what do you have to say for yourself?"
Fluttershy says: "I said, what do you have to say for yourself?"
Fluttershy says: "There, there."
Fluttershy says: "No need to cry."
Fluttershy says: "You're not a bad dragon, you just made a bad decision."
Fluttershy says: "Now go pack your things."
Fluttershy says: "You just need to find a new place to sleep."
Fluttershy says: "That's all."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You did it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I knew you could do it."
Spike says: "I said come back here!"
Spike says: "Ooh!"
Spike says: "How does Fluttershy put up with you furry little things?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, take a letter."
Spike says: "With pleasure."
I am happy to report that the dragon has departed our fair country, and that it was my good friend, Fluttershy, who convinced him to go. This adventure has taught me to never lose faith in your friends. They can be an amazing source of strength, and can help you overcome even your greatest fears.
Always your faithful student,.
Twilight Sparkle.
Applejack says: "Twilight!"
Applejack says: "You gotta come see this!"
Applejack says: "She's just five away from a new pony record!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Three hundred forty-seven, three hundred forty-eight..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Dragon!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Why are you laughing?"
Rainbow Dash says: "That awful dragon is back!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie Pie, you scared me!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I mean, uh, you..."
Rainbow Dash says: "broke my concentration."
Fluttershy says: "It's okay, Rainbow Dash."
Fluttershy says: "Not everypony can be as brave as me."
