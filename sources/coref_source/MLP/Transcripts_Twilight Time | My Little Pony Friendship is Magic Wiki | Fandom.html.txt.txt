Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh, Sweetie Belle, maybe we should run through the steps another few times before you try it on your own."
Sweetie Belle says: "Nope."
Sweetie Belle says: "Ready to give it a shot!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay then!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Ugh!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Think I threw my neck out..."
Scootaloo says: "Aw, you're okay."
Apple Bloom says: "A little more magic practice and liftin' brooms'll be a cinch!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I doubt it."
Sweetie Belle says: "That thing weighs a ton."
Spike says: "Hey, has anypony seen my– Oh, there it is."
Sweetie Belle says: "Hmph."
Sweetie Belle says: "I'll never get my cutie mark for this..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Maybe not."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But I'm happy to keep helping you learn just for the fun of it as long as you like."
Spike says: "Hey, who's gonna clean up this mess?"
Scootaloo says: "This is no mess!"
Scootaloo says: "These are the carefully arranged pieces of a unicycle I took apart and will be putting back together..."
Scootaloo says: "as soon as Twilight shows me how."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Scootaloo, I already told you I won't show you how, but I'll help you find the instructions so you can figure it out yourself."
Scootaloo says: "Ugh, I hate research!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "To your left, third shelf from the bottom."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You'll find it in no time."
Apple Bloom says: "Thanks so much for helpin' us all learn these new skills, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Always glad to pass on my love of learning for learning's sake."
Apple Bloom says: "Only I'm afraid I'll never get the hang of this potion-makin'."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Did you follow the magic plant-growing formula I gave you?"
Apple Bloom says: "Well..."
Apple Bloom says: "uh..."
Apple Bloom says: "more or less."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, let's try it out on this apple seedling and see how we do."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh..."
Apple Bloom says: "I hope this works."
Apple Bloom says: "Layin' it on a little thick there, aren't we, pal?"
Diamond Tiara says: "Yoo-hoo!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Gather 'round!"
Diamond Tiara says: "It's time!"
Diamond Tiara says: "As you all know, I had promised to put on an amazing, first-time-ever acrobatic display for you all today!"
Diamond Tiara says: "I know, it's so exciting."
Diamond Tiara says: "But I'm tired."
Foals says: "Awww..."
Diamond Tiara says: "But I did not wish to disappoint you all, so I brought my butler Randolph to do them for me."
Silver Spoon says: "That was amazing, Diamond Tiara."
Diamond Tiara says: "I know."
Diamond Tiara says: "I don't know how I do it."
Apple Bloom says: "I can't believe she gets so much attention without even really doing anything!"
Scootaloo says: "She's using somepony else to build herself up, and without even putting any effort to learn her own skills like we do!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Hey, come to think of it, if we get really good at the stuff Twilight's teaching us, we could be the big shots around here for a change!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Hmm..."
Scootaloo says: "Check this out!"
Apple Bloom says: "And check this out!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Now check this out!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Hey, put me down!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Hey, can you hear me?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Huh?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Huh?"
Sweetie Belle says: "What?"
Sweetie Belle says: "What?"
Diamond Tiara says: "I was asking if your sister Rarity will be taking you to Manehattan anytime soon."
Silver Spoon says: "Because if she is, maybe you can meet up with us while we hang out with a bunch of famous celebrities."
Scootaloo says: "Cool!"
Apple Bloom says: "Wow, that's..."
Apple Bloom says: "pretty nice of you guys."
Sweetie Belle says: "Actually, my sister hasn't offered to take me to Manehattan anytime soon."
Diamond Tiara says: "Yeah, we figured."
Diamond Tiara says: "Bump, bump, sugar lump rump!"
Silver Spoon says: "Bump, bump, sugar lump rump!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh, yeah?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, I don't have to go all the way to Manehattan to hang out with the famous and super-cool ponies!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Me and my friends hang out with Princess Twilight all the time!"
Diamond Tiara says: "D-did you say Princess Twilight?!"
Diamond Tiara says: "!"
Diamond Tiara says: "You hang out with her all the time?"
Diamond Tiara says: "For real?"
Apple Bloom says: "More like just once a week."
Scootaloo says: "She helps us learn cool new stuff to do!"
Scootaloo says: "That we actually do ourselves!"
Diamond Tiara says: "You must bring me along next time you go!"
Silver Spoon says: "Bring us along!"
Diamond Tiara says: "I mean, we used to see her around town all the time, and I thought, "whatever"..."
Silver Spoon says: "Me too."
Silver Spoon says: "I thought that."
Diamond Tiara says: "But now she's a princess, which makes her totally awesome!"
Silver Spoon says: "Plus, she has wings."
Diamond Tiara says: "And she's an Alicorn."
Silver Spoon says: "We!"
Diamond Tiara says: "–go?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Would you two excuse us for a moment?"
Sweetie Belle says: "We should totally say yes!"
Sweetie Belle says: "This is a golden opportunity!"
Apple Bloom says: "Are you kiddin'?"
Apple Bloom says: "I don't want them laughing at us while I'm mixin' potions and accidentally sendin' plants into chokin' fits!"
Sweetie Belle says: "But don't you get it?"
Sweetie Belle says: "They'll have to learn something too!"
Scootaloo says: "And they won't be able to laugh at us when they're so busy trying to learn stuff of their own."
Apple Bloom says: "I must admit it's kinda fun to see them workin' hard to get on our good side for a change."
Diamond Tiara says: "Oh, my gosh!"
Diamond Tiara says: "A princess lives in there!"
Diamond Tiara says: "And I'm about to go inside and see her!"
Diamond Tiara says: "I can't even tell you how excited I am!"
Silver Spoon says: "I can't either!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Now remember, Twilight takes this time out with us so we can learn stuff."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey there, guys!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Come on in!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Princess Twilight!"
Silver Spoon says: "Princess Twilight!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Oh, it's really her!"
Silver Spoon says: "Oh, my gosh, I don't believe it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, and, uh, you brought guests."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Great!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Princess Twilight, it is such a thrill and honor to be here!"
Diamond Tiara says: "You have no idea."
Diamond Tiara says: "Oh my gosh, who dyes your tail?"
Silver Spoon says: "I so have to get that done."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Actually, it's not dyed."
Diamond Tiara says: "Are those books in there?"
Diamond Tiara says: "What a bold design choice!"
Silver Spoon says: "You should so do that, Di!"
Diamond Tiara says: "I know, right?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Listen, I'm all for helping as many ponies as I can, but maybe we should keep these weekly visits just between us, hm?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, which one of you wants to practice first?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Shouldn't they go first?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, silly!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I set up Twilight Time especially for you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Apple Bloom, go ahead."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's see how your plant potions are coming."
Apple Bloom says: "I can't believe I let you talk us into bringin' guests yesterday."
Scootaloo says: "I didn't hear them laugh at us once, Apple Bloom."
Apple Bloom says: "'Cause they laughed on the inside."
Sweetie Belle says: "Don't worry."
Sweetie Belle says: "We won't make that same mistake again."
Apple Bloom says: "Aw, great."
Apple Bloom says: "Look who showed up to make fun of us."
Scootaloo says: "So much for learning skills to be big shots."
Diamond Tiara says: "Hey, guess what!"
Diamond Tiara says: "I told everyone about your special Twilight Time!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh, no, here it comes..."
Diamond Tiara says: "And they all want in!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Thanks to me, you three are now the hottest thing around."
Diamond Tiara says: "You're welcome."
Sweetie Belle says: "Uh-oh..."
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Wow!"
Sweetie Belle says: "All these ponies really wanna meet Twilight that badly?"
Pipsqueak says: "We love you, Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Now, now, everypony!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Demanding time with the princess as an unruly mob simply won't do."
Diamond Tiara says: "Might I suggest you get organized through us, the Cutie Mark Crusaders' nearest and dearest friends?"
Silver Spoon says: "Everypony get in line!"
Silver Spoon says: "No pushing, no pushing!"
Apple Bloom says: "What a mess."
Sweetie Belle says: "Of awesome!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Don't you see?"
Sweetie Belle says: "We're really and truly and certifiably the biggest of the big shots in school right now!"
Scootaloo says: "Huh?"
Sweetie Belle says: "They all think we're the greatest, because we're their ticket to get time with Ponyville's newest and biggest celebrity, Princess Twilight!"
Apple Bloom says: "We just said like two seconds ago that invitin' two ponies to Twilight Time was a big mistake!"
Apple Bloom says: "And now we're supposed to bring the whole class?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Relax."
Sweetie Belle says: "I got this."
Apple Bloom says: "I don't like this, Sweetie Belle..."
Sweetie Belle says: "You said not to invite them to Twilight Time and I didn't."
Sweetie Belle says: "So what's the problem?"
Scootaloo says: "This feels like a trick."
Sweetie Belle says: "What's tricky about inviting Twilight out for a meal thanking her for all the nice things she's done for us?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Seems like the least we can do for the princess!"
Pipsqueak says: "Did someone say "princess"?"
Sweetie Belle says: "When I told you when you could come eyeball the princess at one of her favorite hangouts, I said only two or three of you, tops!"
Foals says: "Oops..."
Scootaloo says: "She's coming!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Okay!"
Sweetie Belle says: "But stay out of sight!"
Diamond Tiara says: "As you wish, Sweetie Belle."
Sweetie Belle says: "Yes, as I wish."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm so honored!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Mm!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You are?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "When you first asked me to help you develop new skills, I thought, 'Working with young students so devoted to the joy of learning purely for its own sake?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What could be better?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "' You all remind me of myself when I was your age!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Yes, well..."
Sweetie Belle says: "we feel the same way."
Apple Bloom says: "That's why we invited you here."
Scootaloo says: "All because of our love of learning!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Twilight!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Haven't seen you here in, like, forever and a half!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've been so busy I forgot how delicious everything is here!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Totally!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, what's going on out there?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, never mind, they're gone."
Pinkie Pie says: "They're back!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Never mind, they're gone."
Pinkie Pie says: "La la-la la-la..."
Apple Bloom says: "Knock it off!"
Apple Bloom says: "What was all this?"
Apple Bloom says: "And this?"
Scootaloo says: "I couldn't help it!"
Scootaloo says: "When I don't smile in a picture, I look sad."
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh, we're gonna look sad all right..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh, can I..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "help you?"
Diamond Tiara says: "Get my picture with her!"
Pipsqueak says: "Me first!"
Silver Spoon says: "Hey!"
Silver Spoon says: "Get out of the shot!"
Sweetie Belle says: "This is bad."
Scootaloo says: "Twilight's gonna be so ticked at us."
Apple Bloom says: "I told ya this was a terrible idea."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You seriously all want my autograph?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, I'll sign just a couple more for you, but then I really must get back to my little friends."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, there you are!"
Pipsqueak says: "Wow, to think I've been to the Hay Burger so many times, never knowing it's a regular hangout for a princess!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This isn't my regular hangout."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm only here to be with them."
Pipsqueak says: "You mean, Princess Twilight decides where it's cool to go based on where they go?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thanks, guys, this was fun!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "See ya around!"
Pipsqueak says: "I'm opening a new lemonade stand!"
Pipsqueak says: "Won't you come to the grand opening?"
Pipsqueak says: "I'll give you free lemonade for a week!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Relax."
Sweetie Belle says: "I know exactly how to handle this."
Pipsqueak says: "More lemonade?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Don't mind if I do!"
Classmate Pony 2 says: "Done shining your hooves!"
Classmate Pony 2 says: "It's an honor to do you the favor!"
Scootaloo says: "Whoa, so bright I can see myself!"
Apple Bloom says: "And so can I!"
Apple Bloom says: "Nice job bedazzlin' my bow!"
Apple Bloom says: "What do I owe you?"
Classmate Pony 3 says: "Your gratitude is thanks enough."
Diamond Tiara says: "You three must come to my pool party."
Diamond Tiara says: "It'll be much cooler than this."
Sweetie Belle says: "Look who's inviting who to her fancy house!"
Apple Bloom says: "I believe we have arrived, Cutie Mark Crusaders."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Yeah!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Wow, this is nice, but there's no one else here."
Sweetie Belle says: "Why is this party cooler, exactly?"
Diamond Tiara says: "Because of all the ponies we're keeping out."
Sweetie Belle says: "This has been great, but we have to go."
Sweetie Belle says: "It's Twilight Time."
Diamond Tiara says: "So, we're coming too, right?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Um..."
Sweetie Belle says: "a-actually, no."
Diamond Tiara says: "Really?"
Diamond Tiara says: "After all the favors we did for you?"
Diamond Tiara says: "After all the favors they did for you?"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Okay, I know exactly how to handle this."
Sweetie Belle says: "Run!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Go, go, go!"
Scootaloo says: "We gotta beat them to Twilight's so we can explain!"
Sweetie Belle says: "This way!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I know a shortcut!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Apple Bloom says: "Then we run, like the wind!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Foals says: "Twilight Time!"
Sweetie Belle says: "We..."
Sweetie Belle says: "made..."
Sweetie Belle says: "it..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Quick!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Twilight, we can explain."
Apple Bloom says: "We know you said we should just keep Twilight Time to us!"
Scootaloo says: "We didn't mean for so many other ponies to be here!"
Scootaloo says: "Honest!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, don't be silly."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I only meant that for your benefit so you could get the most out of our time together."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But if you want to share your time with others, that's fine."
Scootaloo says: "So you're not mad?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Of course not!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Come on in, everypony!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike made nachos!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Turns out we'll need some more than that."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Before we start, we should maybe get a bit more organized?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ponies interested in magic in this corner."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ponies who want to learn potions over here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Bookworm ponies over there."
Apple Bloom says: "Incredible."
Apple Bloom says: "Looks like everything's workin' out just fine."
Scootaloo says: "And I was so afraid Twilight would be disappointed in us."
Sweetie Belle says: "Told you I knew exactly how to handle all this!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thanks to all of you for taking time out to come learn new things."
Diamond Tiara says: "Thank you, princess!"
Silver Spoon says: "We love you, princess!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, okay, let's settle down."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If you want to thank anypony, thank the Cutie Mark Crusaders for so generously sharing this time."
Sweetie Belle says: "It was nothing, really."
Sweetie Belle says: "We just felt it was the right thing to do."
Diamond Tiara says: "Hmph!"
Diamond Tiara says: "What a laugh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's begin over here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And what would you like to learn, little one?"
Pipsqueak says: "I want to learn how to become a Cutie Mark Crusader!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And why do you want to become a Cutie Mark Crusader so badly, hm?"
Pipsqueak says: "Because then I could get all my classmates to do me favors and stuff because I'm friends with a famous princess!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh, boy."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Is this true?"
Sweetie Belle says: "We wanted our time together just as a way to be with you and learn new things."
Sweetie Belle says: "Really and truly!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Prove it."
Sweetie Belle says: "Huh?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "If it's true, then I'm sure you've all been practicing your skills over the past week."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Show me how much better you got."
Apple Bloom says: "Uh, well, uh..."
Apple Bloom says: "we..."
Apple Bloom says: "can't."
Scootaloo says: "We kinda rushed over and forgot to bring our stuff."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hm, I see."
Sweetie Belle says: "No, wait!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Hey, everypony, you're in luck!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You came to learn, but instead you're getting dinner and a show!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Get ready, 'cause we, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, are about to lay on you the amazing skills we learned in Twilight Time!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Unfortunately, since we don't have Scootaloo's unicycle parts, she'll take apart and put back together one of the scooters from outside."
Pipsqueak says: "Hey!"
Pipsqueak says: "That's my scooter!"
Scootaloo says: "You got us into this mess, kid."
Scootaloo says: "Might wanna roll with us."
Pipsqueak says: "Huh?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Apple Bloom doesn't have her apple seed with her, so she'll just grab an apple from the kitchen."
Sweetie Belle says: "And I will begin by using my magic to lift this broom!"
Scootaloo says: "Ta-da!"
Apple Bloom says: "Become a tree!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Rise!"
Sweetie Belle says: "That didn't turn out quite how I had hoped."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Looks like Twilight Time is over."
Diamond Tiara says: "And look who's not the princess's entourage anymore."
Foals says: "Oooh!"
Silver Spoon says: "Guess they didn't come here to learn after all."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, neither did any of you."
Foals says: "Awww..."
Sweetie Belle says: "We're really sorry, Twilight."
Sweetie Belle says: "We made a huge mistake."
Apple Bloom says: "And we really and truly did enjoy learning new skills with you."
Scootaloo says: "Guess we'll have to just keep on doing it without you now."
Scootaloo says: "Thanks, Twilight."
Apple Bloom says: "Thanks..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Thanks..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sweetie Belle?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Remember a moment ago when you asked me to give you a chance?"
Spike says: "Aw, come on!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I guess Twilight must not be so super-upset anymore, 'cause she's letting us do a diary entry like our sisters do."
Sweetie Belle says: "Boy, did we get our priorities messed up."
Sweetie Belle says: "We started acting special because we were friends with someone special."
Sweetie Belle says: "We almost forgot the real reason she's special – because she's our friend."
Sweetie Belle says: "But she forgave us, and, like magic, things are good as new!"
Sweetie Belle says: "That's the kind of magic I really want to get good at, now that I'm getting so good at the other kind."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wow, all three of you have made so much progress!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm really proud of you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "See you next time!"
Sweetie Belle says: "We're just glad Twilight Time is back to normal."
Sweetie Belle says: "Well..."
Sweetie Belle says: "almost back to normal."
Sweetie Belle says: "I just hope no one sees us."
Apple Bloom says: "'Cause we're tryin' to keep Twilight Time a secret now?"
Scootaloo says: "Or because we look ridiculous?"
Sweetie Belle says: "A little of both, actually."
