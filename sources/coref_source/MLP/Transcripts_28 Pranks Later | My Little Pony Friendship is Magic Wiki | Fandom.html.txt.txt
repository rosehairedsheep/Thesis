Fluttershy says: "I'm so sorry I lost track of time at our picnic."
Fluttershy says: "I didn't mean for us to get caught out here after dark."
Fluttershy says: "But there's really nothing to be afraid of."
Fluttershy says: "The forest at night is the same as the forest during the day."
Fluttershy says: "Only..."
Fluttershy says: "darker."
Fluttershy says: "Still, maybe we should hurry back to the cottage."
Fluttershy says: "Nothing to worry about."
Fluttershy says: "No reason to..."
Fluttershy says: "Ruuuun!"
Fluttershy says: "Aah!"
Fluttershy says: "That wasn't funny!"
Fluttershy says: "You really scared me!"
Fluttershy says: "I hope you're happy."
Rainbow Dash says: "Nope."
Rainbow Dash says: "You're too easy."
Rainbow Dash says: "You're scared of everything."
Fluttershy says: "That's not true."
Rainbow Dash says: "Boo."
Fluttershy says: "Aah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I mean, how could you not appreciate that?"
Fluttershy says: "Because I don't think being scared is very fun!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I do!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Your heart gets all racy, your hooves get all tingly, your mouth gets all dry-ie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Actually, I don't like that part."
Pinkie Pie says: "But the rest is great!"
Rainbow Dash says: "See?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Everypony likes a good prank!"
Rainbow Dash says: "They're just jokes!"
Rarity says: "Now, Rainbow Dash, I don't think Fluttershy would have called us all here to talk about this if she thought it was funny."
Rarity says: "Everypony has things they like and things they don't."
Applejack says: "And scarin' Fluttershy is just lazy."
Rainbow Dash says: "Lazy?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "A prank isn't very good if you're the only pony laughing."
Pinkie Pie says: "But what if it's really, really, really, really, really funny?"
Rainbow Dash says: "And I can do funny."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know you can."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I guess the trick is making sure that your idea of funny matches the pony you're pranking."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That way—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Good one, Rainbow!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ha-ha!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You have to admit!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That was funny!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not really."
Applejack says: "Yeah."
Applejack says: "A whoopee cushion is like a joke shortcut."
Rainbow Dash says: "What?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Rarity says: "Honestly, Rainbow Dash, if you are not willing to put forth the effort required to pull a prank that everypony can enjoy, you may as well not pull one at all."
Rainbow Dash says: "Fine!"
Rainbow Dash says: "If you ponies want effort, then that's just what you'll get."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm not sure she understood what we meant."
Rarity says: "I know you're excited about the Filly Guide Cookie Drive, but I still have to do a few finishing touches on your uniform."
Sweetie Belle says: "Hmm."
Sweetie Belle says: "Not bad."
Rarity says: "Huh."
Rarity says: ""You asked for it."
Sweetie Belle says: "What does it mean?"
Rarity says: "Hmm."
Rarity says: "I assume this is Dash's idea of a prank, which can only mean she's rigged some kind of booby trap to your Filly Guide uniform up there."
Sweetie Belle says: "So how do we get it down?"
Rarity says: "We don't."
Rarity says: "If Dash thinks I'm going to fall for whatever she's got in mind, she's got another thing coming."
Rarity says: "There's more uniforms where that one came from!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Hmm."
Sweetie Belle says: "The sewing machine cake is actually better than the cake cake."
Rarity says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Gotcha!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ha-ha!"
Rainbow Dash says: "How's that for effort?"
Apple Bloom says: "What's all this, Applejack?"
Apple Bloom says: "I thought you were gonna help me get ready for the Filly Guide Cookie Drive."
Applejack says: "Uh, yeah, sorry about that."
Applejack says: "But Rainbow Dash has been on a prankin' tear, and you can never be too careful."
Apple Bloom says: "Do you really think Dash is gonna try and prank you in your sleep?"
Applejack says: "Not if I have anythin' to say about it."
Applejack says: "See ya in the mornin', sugarcube."
Applejack says: "Huh?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ha!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Still think I'm lazy?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Gotcha!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pigpen..."
Applejack says: "Ugh!"
Applejack says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Gotcha!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Gotcha!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Gotcha!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Gotcha!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We need your help."
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay!"
Pinkie Pie says: "For what?"
Rarity says: "Are you honestly going to stand there and tell us you know nothing about all the pranking Rainbow Dash has been doing?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, no!"
Pinkie Pie says: "She's been pranking up a storm!"
Fluttershy says: "Did she get you, too?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, yeah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "She and Gummy both!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Boo!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Aaah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "They got me good."
Applejack says: "Well, she needs to stop."
Pinkie Pie says: "Stop?"
Pinkie Pie says: "But pranks are so much fun!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not for everypony."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And it doesn't seem like Dash is taking the time to find out who enjoys them and who doesn't."
Rarity says: "Uh, since you and Dash share such an, uh, affinity for pranking, we thought you might be able to get her to, um, uh..."
Rarity says: "quit it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, Rainbow Dash!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I have something very important to tell you!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie, hey!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I actually have something totally important to tell you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You do?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You go first!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay, you know how I've been pranking everypony?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's been pretty funny!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I-I-I mean, actually, that's what I have to talk to you about."
Rainbow Dash says: "Here."
Rainbow Dash says: "Have a cookie."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Thanks!"
Rainbow Dash says: "So, I got to thinking – why waste my time pranking everypony one at a time when I could prank everypony at once?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Mmm, wow!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Everypony at once?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That sounds amazing!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Gah, wait!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I mean, it's not."
Rainbow Dash says: "You don't even know what it is yet!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie, this is gonna be the best prank ever!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I special ordered these joke cookies so the colors would match my mane."
Pinkie Pie says: "And?"
Rainbow Dash says: "And I'm gonna switch them with the Filly Guide cookies."
Rainbow Dash says: "When Scootaloo and her friends sell them, everypony in town's gonna get a rainbow mouth courtesy of Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ha-ha!"
Rainbow Dash says: "It's gonna be so awesome!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, I don't know."
Pinkie Pie says: "I mean, it doesn't really seem all that funny."
Rainbow Dash says: "What?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Maybe this is a good time to stop pranking for a while."
Pinkie Pie says: "The other ponies in town really—"
Rainbow Dash says: "Stop?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "No way!"
Rainbow Dash says: "This prank is happening, Pinkie!"
Rainbow Dash says: "And it's gonna be hilarious!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie, what's the deal?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I told you I needed your help switching out all the Filly Guide cookies for the joke cookies."
Rainbow Dash says: "But when you didn't show, I had to do it all by myself!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, Pinkie?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wow."
Rainbow Dash says: "Your face is still pretty rainbowed."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah, I haven't really  been feeling well."
Pinkie Pie says: "And these joke cookies are the only thing that makes me feel better."
Pinkie Pie says: "You don't have any more, do you?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, no."
Rainbow Dash says: "I just told you, I used them all for the prank."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Pretty soon, the CMCs will start selling them to everypony in town."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ponies will open their boxes and start eating, then all of their teeth will turn rainbow-colored, and they'll know it was me!"
Rainbow Dash says: "It's gonna be so awesome!"
Rainbow Dash says: "C'mon, you don't wanna miss it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Actually..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Unless you've got more cookies!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Aah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "On second thought, maybe you better stay here and rest."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah."
Pinkie Pie says: "You're right."
Pinkie Pie says: "Sorry to miss out."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm sure it's gonna be hilarious."
Rainbow Dash says: "All right, who's ready to sell some cookies?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Me!"
Applejack says: "Look here, Rainbow Dash."
Applejack says: "I know you promised Scootaloo you'd help out, but I don't want none of your pranks ruinin' these fillies' night."
Rainbow Dash says: "Look, I'll be with you the whole night so you can totally keep an eye on me."
Apple Bloom says: "Come on, Applejack!"
Apple Bloom says: "Let's get started!"
Scootaloo says: "Yeah!"
Scootaloo says: "We've got a lot of ground to cover!"
Sweetie Belle says: "We wanna hit every house in Ponyville!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You heard her!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Every house in Ponyville!"
Applejack says: "I think you three should be real proud."
Applejack says: "Y'all did a mighty impressive job for your first go-'round."
Rarity says: "You took the words right out of my mouth, Applejack."
Rarity says: "Isn't that right, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Any minute now."
Applejack says: "Uh..."
Applejack says: ""any minute now" what?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, uh, nothing!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Have you guys noticed how quiet it's gotten?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I mean, it's still early, right?"
Rarity says: "Of course it's quiet."
Rarity says: "Ponies can't talk while they're eating those fabulous cookies, heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "You think?"
Rarity says: "Of course."
Rarity says: "They're probably all in a cookie coma right now."
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Maybe you're right."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'll go check."
Rainbow Dash says: "What is going on..."
Rainbow Dash says: "?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay."
Rainbow Dash says: "Definite cookie-eating happening."
Rainbow Dash says: "But..."
Rainbow Dash says: "where is everypony?"
Rainbow Dash says: "They must have seen their rainbow mouths by now..."
Rainbow Dash says: "They should all be running out into the streets!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Unless everypony went to bed early..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie?"
Rainbow Dash says: "The whole town got the cookies, and now everypony is shut up in their houses!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You don't think there's something wrong with the joke cookies, do you?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Mrs."
Rainbow Dash says: "Cake!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Phew!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Have you seen Pinkie?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I was thinking I might have something to do with her not feeling great."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Mrs..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Cake..."
Rainbow Dash says: "?"
Mrs. Cake says: "Cookies..."
Mrs. Cake says: "!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Cookies!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, I can see you're busy!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'll come back!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uhh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Cookies..."
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Mrs. Cake says: "More..."
Mrs. Cake says: "cookies..."
Mrs. Cake says: "!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Cookies..."
Mrs. Cake says: "!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Cookies..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Cookies..."
Mrs. Cake says: "cooooooooooooookiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeees..."
Pinkie Pie says: "cooooooooooooookiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeees..."
Mrs. Cake says: "Moooooore cooooookies..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Moooooore cooooookies..."
Pinkie Pie says: "More cookies..."
Rainbow Dash says: "You gotta come with me to Sugarcube Corner!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Something's going on with the Cakes!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, not something exactly."
Rainbow Dash says: "I mean, it may have something to do with these joke cookies..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Cooooooookies..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, no!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Coooooookies..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Fluttershy—"
Fluttershy says: "Cooooooookies..."
Granny Smith says: "Cooooooookiiiiiiieeeeeeees..."
Granny Smith says: "Cookies..."
Applejack says: "You sure you don't mind us all comin' over?"
Rarity says: "Oh, of course not."
Rarity says: "I think the girls have earned a little celebration for all of their hard work."
Rarity says: "And I have plenty of sewing machine cake left over."
Rarity says: "Unless anypony wants a cookie..."
Rarity says: "?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't touch those!"
Rarity says: "Oh!"
Rarity says: "There is certainly no call for that!"
Rarity says: "There's plenty for everypony."
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We gotta get outta here!"
Applejack says: "What in tarnation are you goin' on about?"
Rainbow Dash says: "There's no time!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You have to follow me!"
Rarity says: "Oh, Rainbow Dash, if you want all of those cookies, you will have to buy them, just like everypony else."
Rainbow Dash says: "I don't want the cookies—"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "But they do!"
Rarity says: "Wh-wh-what..."
Rarity says: "What's happening?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'll explain later."
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on!"
Sweetie Belle says: "We need to find somewhere to hide!"
Granny Smith says: "Cookie!"
Granny Smith says: "Cookie!"
Applejack says: "This way!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Did we lose them?"
Scootaloo says: "Why are we running from the ponies of Ponyville?"
Sweetie Belle says: "What happened to all of our friends?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I think it's something in the cookies."
Applejack says: "Ugh!"
Applejack says: "That's ridiculous!"
Applejack says: "Filly Guide cookies haven't changed for years!"
Applejack says: "It's not like there's a new ingredient that's turnin' the whole town into cookie-cravin' zombies."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, unless there..."
Rainbow Dash says: "is..."
Rarity says: "What are you saying?"
Applejack says: "What did you do?"
Zombie ponies says: "Coooooookiiiiiiiieeeee..."
Zombie ponies says: "coooooookiiiiiiieeee..."
Zombie ponies says: "."
Rainbow Dash says: "Cover the windows!"
Zombie ponies says: "Coooook..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay!"
Rainbow Dash says: "So I may have switched all the Filly Guide cookies for joke cookies that were supposed to make ponies' mouths rainbow but somehow turned everypony into mindless cookie-eating zombies instead!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I figure we just hide out here until the effects wear off, and as long as nopony else eats the cookies, we'll be fine."
Rarity says: "That's lovely, darling, except for one thing..."
Rarity says: "We've already eaten theeeeeeeeeemmmmm..."
Applejack says: "Looks like your prank up and backfiiiirrrrreeeeed..."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Cooooooookiiiieeeees..."
Rainbow Dash says: "No, no!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Stay away!"
Rainbow Dash says: "They're making you sick!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You don't want these!"
Pinkie Pie says: "But we dooooooo..."
Pinkie Pie says: "We want cookiiiiiiiieeeeeeees..."
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Nngh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Please!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Stop!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I never meant for this to happen!"
Rainbow Dash says: "It was just a harmless prank!"
Rainbow Dash says: "It was supposed to be funny!"
Rainbow Dash says: "But this isn't funny at all!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Exactly!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wait..."
Rainbow Dash says: "What's happening?"
Rarity says: "Just delighting in pranking the prankster."
Applejack says: "Yeah."
Applejack says: "How does it feel to get some of your own medicine?"
Rainbow Dash says: "So..."
Rainbow Dash says: "you're..."
Rainbow Dash says: "not sick?"
Rainbow Dash says: "None of you are?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Of course not, silly!"
Crowd says: "Gotcha!"
Rainbow Dash says: "This..."
Rainbow Dash says: "was all..."
Rainbow Dash says: "a prank?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Applejack says: "Yep!"
Applejack says: "And you can thank Pinkie Pie."
Applejack says: "After you told her about your plan to prank the whole town, she got everypony together and came up with a way to turn the tables on you."
Pinkie Pie says: "Aw, shucks, it was nothing!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Just a little something I threw together."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh..."
Scootaloo says: "Wow!"
Scootaloo says: "You should see your face!"
Apple Bloom says: "Talk about funny!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, I don't think it's very funny!"
Rainbow Dash says: "And I'm the one that got pranked!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I was really scared!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I thought I made everypony sick!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You can't just go around—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "pranking whoever you feel like?"
Fluttershy says: "Without thinking about how it might make them feel?"
Rarity says: "Or if they'd even enjoy it?"
Applejack says: "Or think it's funny?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ohhh."
Rainbow Dash says: "I see what you did there."
Pinkie Pie says: "Pranks can be a lot of fun when everypony has a good time."
Pinkie Pie says: "I thought you just needed to see what it's like when they don't."
Rainbow Dash says: "I guess I did."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm sorry, everypony."
Rainbow Dash says: "I haven't really been thinking about how other ponies feel."
Fluttershy says: "Well, I hope you learned your lesson."
Rainbow Dash says: "Totally!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You ponies pulled off an amazing prank!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'll have to work extra hard to top it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Gotcha."
