Smolder says: "Uh, Headmare Twilight?"
Smolder says: "Sorry to bug you in the Teachers' Lounge."
Smolder says: "Is it okay if I miss class?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Mm-hmm."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You can make it up tomorrow."
Smolder says: "Actually, I'll be gone for a week."
Twilight Sparkle says: "A week?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "In the middle of the semester?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, is everything all right, Smolder?"
Smolder says: "Not exactly."
Smolder says: "My brother's been having a hard time since I left for school."
Smolder says: "I want to go home and check on him."
Smolder says: "He's a really sweet guy, and the other dragons can be kind of rough."
Spike says: "Did you say "sweet guy" and "dragon" in the same sentence?"
Smolder says: "Yeah."
Smolder says: "He's sort of like you, Spike."
Spike says: "Awww..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm sorry to hear about your brother, Smolder."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But the Dragon Lands are really far for you to go by yourself."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And I'm not sure about you missing so much class."
Spike says: "Hey!"
Spike says: "What if she got a school credit for it?"
Spike says: "Kind of like a..."
Spike says: "a kindness field trip?"
Spike says: "I'll go with her."
Smolder says: "Thanks!"
Smolder says: "The Dragon Lord is way too busy for personal problems when it's baby dragon hatching season."
Fluttershy says: "Baby..."
Fluttershy says: "dragon..."
Fluttershy says: "hatching season?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "All those cute little snouts poking out of those adorable little shells?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Teeny, tiny, twitchy tails?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Can I go too?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, you are the perfect pony to lead a kindness field trip."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fine."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But I'm gonna expect a full report when you get back."
Smolder says: "How many pages?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I was talking to Fluttershy."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hatching season sounds fascinating!"
Spike says: "Okay, I made a list of what cheers me up when I'm down, so if your brother's like me, he's gonna love it!"
Spike says: "What should we do first?"
Spike says: "The Smile Song?"
Spike says: "The sharing circle?"
Spike says: "Or friendship bracelet weaving?"
Smolder says: "I'm not sure those are the kind of things my brother's gonna be into."
Fluttershy says: "Well, what would make your brother happy?"
Smolder says: "Just having Spike and me accept him for who he is will make a huge difference."
Smolder says: "Dragons who appreciate his more sensitive side."
Spike says: "I got it!"
Spike says: "Show tunes!"
Smolder says: "Yeah, no, but good try."
Fluttershy says: "That's an interesting smell."
Smolder says: "It's good to be home."
Spike says: "I can't wait to meet your brother, Smolder."
Spike says: "We're gonna be best buddies."
Spike says: "I just know it."
Smolder says: "He usually hangs out near here."
Smolder says: "I'll go try and find him."
Fluttershy says: "Spike, do you mind if I take a peek at the cute little baby eggs?"
Spike says: "No problem."
Spike says: "I'll stay here and finish this comfort blanket."
Spike says: "It'll be like a hug every time Smolder's brother wraps it around himself."
Fluttershy says: "Awww."
Fluttershy says: "I'm sure he'll love it, Spike."
Ember says: "It can't answer you."
Ember says: "It's an egg."
Fluttershy says: "Ah, Dragon Lord Ember."
Fluttershy says: "How nice to see you."
Ember says: "Nice to see you too..."
Ember says: "uh..."
Ember says: "Which one are you again?"
Ember says: "The party one?"
Ember says: "Apple Dash!"
Ember says: "Or was that the country one?"
Fluttershy says: "Fluttershy."
Fluttershy says: "The one who loves creatures."
Fluttershy says: "Are..."
Fluttershy says: "all these yours?"
Ember says: "What?!"
Ember says: "!"
Ember says: "No!"
Ember says: "None of them are."
Ember says: "Watching over eggs is just part of the glamorous life of a Dragon Lord."
Fluttershy says: "I think it sounds wonderful."
Ember says: "Yeah?"
Ember says: "Then maybe you can help."
Fluttershy says: "I'd love to!"
Fluttershy says: "Just tell me what to do!"
Ember says: "I don't know."
Ember says: "It's my first time being in charge."
Ember says: "Dad wasn't big on sharing Dragon Lord details."
Ember says: "It's kind of a "burn or be burned" job."
Fluttershy says: "Well, I'm sure you're doing great."
Ember says: "Not really."
Ember says: "The eggs should've hatched by now."
Ember says: "But none of them have even cracked."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, dear."
Fluttershy says: "Maybe they're lonely?"
Fluttershy says: "Don't you worry."
Fluttershy says: "Auntie Fluttershy's here."
Fluttershy says: "And the Dragon Lord and I are gonna do everything we can to welcome you into this world."
Ember says: "Really?"
Ember says: "How?"
Fluttershy says: "Um..."
Fluttershy says: "I have no idea."
Spike says: "Now, that's a thing of beauty."
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Garble says: "Well, if it isn't our little pony friend Spike."
Spike says: "That's Equestria's official friendship ambassador to the Dragon Lands to you!"
Spike says: "And I'm not little!"
Spike says: "I had the molt."
Spike says: "See?"
Garble says: "Oh-ho-ho, runt's got wings."
Garble says: "I'm soooo impressed."
Garble says: "What's that supposed to be?"
Spike says: "Nothing!"
Spike says: "Aah!"
Garble says: "Looks like a baby blanket to me."
Spike says: "It's not a baby blanket."
Spike says: "It's a..."
Spike says: "comfort blanket."
Garble says: "Awwww."
Garble says: "Did your pony pals make it for you with friendship and gumdrops?"
Spike says: "No."
Spike says: "I made it."
Spike says: "And by the way, knitting's a lot harder than it looks."
Garble says: "Check out the baby blanket, guys!"
Garble says: "It's a lot harder than it looks!"
Garble says: "Got your bwanky!"
"Billy" says: "Aw, little baby crying?"
Garble says: "Oh!"
Garble says: "Missed!"
"Billy" says: "Bet he broke a claw and everything."
Spike says: "Give it back!"
Spike says: "That's for my friend!"
Spike says: "Cut it out!"
Spike says: "You know laugh fire's dangerous!"
Spike says: "It canâ€”"
Spike says: "!"
Spike says: "..."
Spike says: "do that."
Smolder says: "Garble!"
Garble says: "Smolder?"
Garble says: "What are you doing here?"
Clump says: "How's it scalin', brah?"
Spike says: "We'd better get out of here before your brother shows up."
Spike says: "Garble isn't very nice to sensitive dragons."
Smolder says: "But Garble is my brother."
Spike says: "Your brother?!"
Spike says: "!"
Garble says: "Got a problem with that, pony-boy?"
Spike says: "Oh, brother."
Smolder says: "I've missed you, bro."
Smolder says: "We got a lot of fun to catch up on."
Smolder says: "There's no lava diving at school."
Clump says: "Good luck gettin' Garble to do anything."
"Billy" says: "Heh, yeah."
"Billy" says: "He's gotten so weird since you left."
"Billy" says: "Hiding and moping around..."
Garble says: "I have not!"
Clump says: "Have so!"
"Billy" says: "Have so!"
Fume says: "Have so!"
Smolder says: "Easy, guys."
Smolder says: "I learned at Twilight's school ganging up on each other isn't half as cool as you think."
Clump says: "Awww."
Clump says: "Pony school made you soft."
Smolder says: "Want to try me and find out?"
Clump says: "M-Maybe later."
Spike says: "So, uh, let's get lava diving."
Spike says: "What do you say?"
"Billy" says: "Better stay here, shrimp."
"Billy" says: "Lava might ruin your blanky-wanky."
Garble says: "Let the wimp tag along."
Garble says: "Then we'll have somedragon to dunk!"
Smolder says: "Hmph."
Smolder says: "Only gonna warn you once."
Smolder says: "Spike's my friend."
Smolder says: "You mess with him, you mess with me."
Smolder says: "Besides, he came here to hang out with you, Garble."
"Billy" says: "Awww."
"Billy" says: "How sweet."
"Billy" says: "Ha!"
Clump says: "Let's go do dragon stuff."
Clump says: "Garble can have fun with his new friend."
Garble says: "But I'm not having fun!"
Garble says: "And he's not my friend!"
Smolder says: "Eh, just ignore them, "Gar-Gar"."
Garble says: "Smolder!"
Garble says: "Not in public!"
Spike says: "Oh, it's okay to have a nickname."
Spike says: "Sometimes I'm called "Spikey-Wikey"."
Garble says: "Seriously?"
Garble says: "You're admitting this?"
Garble says: "I am not hanging out with him."
Smolder says: "Give him a chance, Garble."
Smolder says: "You guys have a lot in common."
Garble says: "Fine."
Garble says: "Race you to the lava pit."
Spike says: "Wait."
Spike says: "I thought you said your brother was sweet."
Smolder says: "All the tough guy stuff is just an act."
Smolder says: "He's a big marshmallow."
Spike says: "Yeah, not seein' it."
Smolder says: "Well, maybe a burnt marshmallow."
Smolder says: "Smoky on the outside, but squishy inside."
Smolder says: "He just needs friends who can appreciate that part."
Smolder says: "Like you."
Smolder says: "You're not changing your mind about helping me cheer him up, are you?"
Spike says: "Me?"
Spike says: "'Course not!"
Smolder says: "Okay!"
Smolder says: "Lava jumping!"
Smolder says: "Just like old times, huh, Gar-Gar?"
Garble says: "Yeah."
Garble says: "Just like old times."
Garble says: "Except for one little annoying thing."
Smolder says: "Scales away!"
Smolder says: "Come on in!"
Smolder says: "The lava's fine!"
Spike says: "You know, whenever I'm feeling a little down, it always helps if I do something with a friend."
Spike says: "How about we jump together?"
Spike says: "Aah!"
Smolder says: "Ooh..."
Smolder says: "Spike?"
Smolder says: "You okay?"
Spike says: "I just don't know what it is."
Garble says: "Cannonball!"
Spike says: "Aah!"
Garble says: "Woo-hoo!"
Garble says: "Oops?"
Spike says: "Ah!"
Spike says: "Swallowing lava."
Spike says: "Swallowing lava's definitely worse."
Garble says: "My bad."
Ember says: "I think you might be encouraging them to stay in."
Ember says: "Dragons aren't much for touchy-feely stuff."
Fluttershy says: "Oh."
Fluttershy says: "I'm sorry."
Fluttershy says: "Are they finally hatching?"
Ember says: "I wish."
Ember says: "They've been doing that for days."
Ember says: "I'm sure it means something, but it's probably not good."
Spike says: "Try this."
Spike says: "Red velvet."
Spike says: "Guaranteed to brighten anycreature's spirits."
Garble says: "Feelin' better already."
Spike says: "I dunno about you, but a change of scenery always turns my frown upside-down."
Spike says: "Aah!"
Spike says: "I will be the bigger dragon."
Spike says: "I will be the bigger dragon."
Spike says: "I will be the bigger dragon."
Spike says: "I will be the bigger dragon."
Spike says: "Sometimes, just hearing what someone appreciates about you can make you feel better about yourself."
Smolder says: "I'll go first."
Smolder says: "Spike, I think it's really nice that you're trying to cheer up Gar-Gar."
Spike says: "Thank you, Smolder."
Spike says: "My turn."
Spike says: "I like how you always let everycreature know how you're feeling, Gar-Gar."
Garble says: "Only Smolder gets to call me that!"
Clump says: "More fresh lava comin' up!"
Spike says: "Okay."
Spike says: "New activity."
Spike says: "Who wants to make vision boards?"
"Billy" says: "Hey, Garble, Smolder!"
"Billy" says: "Surf's up!"
Garble says: "Let me show you how it's done!"
Smolder says: "You coming?"
Spike says: "I'll..."
Spike says: "catch up with you."
Fluttershy says: "Spike!"
Fluttershy says: "There you are!"
Spike says: "Hey, Fluttershy."
Fluttershy says: "For a land that's all rocks, this place is surprisingly easy to get lost in."
Spike says: "How are the baby dragons doing?"
Fluttershy says: "The eggs won't hatch."
Fluttershy says: "They just keep shaking."
Fluttershy says: "I'm starting to think the dragons are too scared to come out."
Fluttershy says: "I was hoping you could help."
Fluttershy says: "If you're not too busy cheering up Smolder's brother."
Spike says: "Not a chance."
Spike says: "Smolder's brother is Garble."
Spike says: "The only thing that cheers him up is to make me miserable."
Garble says: "Hey, Spike!"
Garble says: "Want to play lavaball?"
Spike says: "Huh?"
Fluttershy says: "Excuse me, but that's not a very nice game!"
Clump says: "Ah!"
Clump says: "Nearly got you!"
Fluttershy says: "ENOUGH!"
Fluttershy says: "I mean, leave my friend alone please."
Fluttershy says: "Spike came all this way to cheer up Garble, which was a very kind thing to do."
"Billy" says: "Awwww, do you need cheering up?"
Clump says: "What's wrong, Garble?"
Clump says: "Did somedwagon hurt your wittle feelings?"
Garble says: "No!"
Garble says: "I-I don't know what she's talking about!"
Garble says: "Spike's the one who's gonna cry!"
Smolder says: "Hey!"
Smolder says: "Are we lava surfing or what?"
Garble says: "Uh, yeah, yeah!"
Garble says: "Let's go hang with a real dragon, not a pony wannabe!"
Spike says: "See?"
Spike says: "It's no use."
Spike says: "Why don't I see what I can do about the eggs and you cheer up Garble?"
Spike says: "At least he listens to you."
Fluttershy says: "Just you wait, Garble."
Fluttershy says: "You're dealing with Fluttershy now, and she's packin' a whole lifetime of kindness!"
Ember says: "Oh..."
Ember says: "Coochie-coochie-coo."
Ember says: "Coochie-coochie-coo."
Ember says: "Coochie-coochie-coo!"
Ember says: "Coochie-coochie."
Ember says: "I said coochieâ€”"
Ember says: "!"
Spike says: "Uh, what are you doing?"
Ember says: "Spike!"
Spike says: "Hi, Ember!"
Ember says: "Shouldn't you be doing whatever it is you do at Twilight's school?"
Spike says: "I wish."
Spike says: "It's a long story."
Spike says: "Wow."
Spike says: "These eggs really do look scared."
Spike says: "Wait."
Spike says: "Aren't the hatching grounds supposed to be hot?"
Ember says: "Uh, of course."
Ember says: "There's a lake of molten lava under them."
Ember says: "That's why the eggs are laid here."
Ember says: "The heat makes them hatch."
Spike says: "Then something's wrong."
Spike says: "I don't think the eggs are shaking because they're afraid."
Spike says: "They're cold."
Ember says: "You're right!"
Ember says: "But what happened to the lava?"
Spike says: "I might have an idea."
Fluttershy says: "Garble!"
Fluttershy says: "Smolder!"
Fluttershy says: "Is anydragon there?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, my."
Fluttershy says: "Are those..."
Fluttershy says: "bongo drums?"
Garble says: "Fire, dragon."
Garble says: "Wig and waggin'."
Garble says: "Feelin' like I be saggin'."
Smolder says: "Oh, yeah."
Smolder says: "I dig."
Garble says: "Ragin' lava."
Garble says: "Balaclava."
Smolder says: "Huh?"
Garble says: "Aah!"
Clump says: "Fresh lava comin' up!"
Spike says: "See?"
Spike says: "I wondered where that lava was coming from."
Spike says: "They must be draining it from the underground lake."
Ember says: "Put that rock back!"
Ember says: "Immediately!"
Clump says: "Uh, yes, Dragon Lord Ember!"
Ember says: "How long have you been removing these boulders?"
Clump says: "Uhhhh..."
Clump says: "a while."
"Billy" says: "It made our lava pool so nice and warm-like."
Ember says: "It's supposed to be heating the eggs!"
Ember says: "Now they'll never hatch!"
Clump says: "Sorry, Dragon Lord Ember!"
"Billy" says: "We'll put the lava back!"
Clump says: "Here you go, lava!"
Clump says: "Come on!"
Clump says: "So difficult!"
Clump says: "And liquid-y!"
Spike says: "I don't think it works that way."
Spike says: "The hatching grounds can't be the only warm place in the Dragon Lands."
Spike says: "There's got to be somewhere else we can take the eggs."
Ember says: "You know how fragile those things are?"
Ember says: "No way we'll be able to move them all safely."
Ember says: "You!"
Ember says: "Go and bring all the dragons to the hatching grounds!"
Ember says: "We'll have to make the heat ourselves!"
Garble says: "What do you think you're doing sneaking around here, pony?!"
Garble says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Sneaking?"
Fluttershy says: "Looks to me like the only one sneaking around is you, Garble."
Fluttershy says: "Why didn't you tell me you were a poet?"
Garble says: "I'm not!"
Fluttershy says: "Words."
Fluttershy says: "Rhythm."
Fluttershy says: "Sometimes rhyme."
Fluttershy says: "Weird punctu..."
Fluttershy says: "ation."
Fluttershy says: "Sure sounds like poetry to me."
Smolder says: "It's okay, Gar-Gar."
Smolder says: "Fluttershy won't think you're soft for being a poet."
Smolder says: "And neither would anydragon who was your real friend."
Garble says: "'Kay, fine."
Garble says: "But I'm not a flowery, namby-pamby poet!"
Garble says: "I'm a beat poet."
Garble says: "Dig?"
Fluttershy says: "I totally feel you."
Garble says: "And you better not tell my friends about it!"
Fluttershy says: "But why?"
Fluttershy says: "If I was a poet, I'd want to share my creations with everypony."
Smolder says: "I'm the only one Garble will perform for."
Smolder says: "He hasn't written any poetry since I left."
Smolder says: "That's why he's been so sad."
Garble says: "I need to create."
Garble says: "But if the other dragons ever found out I like this junk, they'd make fun of me forever."
Fluttershy says: "Is that why you pick on Spike?"
Fluttershy says: "To make your friends think you're tough?"
Smolder says: "Wait."
Smolder says: "You've been picking on Spike?"
Garble says: "Uh..."
Garble says: "only when you're not looking."
Garble says: "But if I didn't pick on Spike, they'd just pick on me!"
Garble says: "And he is kind of a weakling."
Fluttershy says: "Hmph!"
Fluttershy says: "I'll have you know Spike is stronger than you are any day!"
Garble says: "Yeah, right!"
Garble says: "That little cupcake-making, blanket-cuddling pony-dragon?"
Garble says: "Give me a break!"
Fluttershy says: "First of all, there's nothing wrong with being a pony!"
Fluttershy says: "Second, Spike isn't afraid to be who he is, no matter what you or anycreature thinks!"
Fluttershy says: "That's real strength!"
Fluttershy says: "Not like some dragons I know."
Smolder says: "For a pony without a horn, she's sure got a point."
Spike says: "I've been looking all over for you guys!"
Spike says: "We need your help!"
Spike says: "Hurry!"
Ember says: "I've ordered everydragon to warm up the eggs, but they still won't hatch."
Ember says: "I don't know what else we can try."
Spike says: "We can't give up!"
Spike says: "There's got to be something we can do!"
"Billy" says: "Yeah!"
"Billy" says: "The wimp can knit 'em up quick-like!"
Spike says: "Hey, watch it!"
Spike says: "That laugh fire could burn somepony!"
Garble says: "Burn..."
Garble says: "Good idea, Spikey-Wikey!"
Garble says: "Eggs, come."
Garble says: "Burst into that light."
Garble says: "Break through shells that bind."
Garble says: "Break free, explore."
Garble says: "Stuck!"
Garble says: "..."
Garble says: "Between rock and..."
Garble says: "hard place."
Garble says: "Freedom, come!"
Garble says: "Don't be shy!"
Garble says: "Look those others in the eye!"
Garble says: "Stake your claim!"
Garble says: "Don't stop!"
Garble says: "Just do!"
Garble says: "Be the one and only..."
Garble says: "you!"
Fluttershy says: "Spike, look!"
Spike says: "What?"
Spike says: "Huh?!"
Spike says: "!"
Spike says: "Their laugh fire's so hot, it's hatching the eggs!"
Garble says: "Come to light!"
Garble says: "Proud to be!"
Garble says: "Open up!"
Garble says: "Bam!"
Garble says: "Be..."
Garble says: "free!"
Smolder says: "You did it, Gar-Gar!"
Smolder says: "You performed in front of other dragons!"
"Billy" says: "And it was super lame!"
"Billy" says: "What kind of weakling writes poetry?"
Ember says: "The hero of the Dragon Lands!"
Ember says: "That's who!"
Smolder says: "Yeah!"
Smolder says: "Garble saved our eggs because he was strong enough to be who he is, whether you liked it or not."
Smolder says: "I grew up thinking it was okay to make fun of differences."
Smolder says: "But my friends have taught me to celebrate them."
Ember says: "And from now on, in my kingdom, that's exactly what we will do."
Ember says: "Now, if you don't mind, can you teach me how to write poetry like that?"
Ember says: "It's pretty cool."
Garble says: "Uh..."
Garble says: "yeah, sure."
Garble says: "No problem!"
"Billy" says: "Yeah, me, too!"
Clump says: "I want to learn!"
Spike says: "Take a number, guys."
Fluttershy says: "I'll take them all!"
