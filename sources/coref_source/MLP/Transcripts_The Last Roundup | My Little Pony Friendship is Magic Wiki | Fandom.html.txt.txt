Applejack says: "I sure hope so."
Apple Bloom says: "Hope so?"
Apple Bloom says: "I know so!"
Apple Bloom says: "After all, you're the ten-time rodeo champeen of Ponyville!"
Apple Bloom says: "Why, you've got more blue ribbons than anypony in Ponyville ever!"
Apple Bloom says: "And I can't wait for my big sis to win every blue ribbon in Equestria and bring home the title of Equestria Rodeo champeen!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Now, careful, Derpy!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't want to do any more damage than you've already done."
Derpy says: "I just don't know what went wrong."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah."
Rainbow Dash says: "It's a mystery."
Derpy says: "Nice work, Rainbow Dash."
Derpy says: "You okay, Rainbow Dash?"
Derpy says: "Anything I can do to help?"
Rainbow Dash says: "No!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Nothing!"
Rainbow Dash says: "In the name of Celestia, just sit there and do nothing!"
Derpy says: "Oops."
Derpy says: "My bad."

Derpy says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Speech!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Speech!"
Applejack says: "Oh, shucks."
Applejack says: "I'm not much for speeches."
Pinkie Pie says: "Alright then, no speech!"
Applejack says: "Buuut!"
Applejack says: "This here is the nicest send off anypony could ask for."
Applejack says: "Y'all have been cheering me on in every rodeo since I was a little little pony."
Applejack says: "So it seems only fittin' to use my winnings to fix up town hall."
Applejack says: "I promise to make Ponyville proud."

Mayor Mare says: "And bring back all that money!"
Applejack says: "You betcha, Mayor."
Pinkie Pie says: "And have fun."
Pinkie Pie says: "And don't be nervous."
Pinkie Pie says: "Or if you are, use that nervous energy to do even better than you already would!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And eat peanuts and popcorn and taffy."
Pinkie Pie says: "Taffy gives lots of nervous energy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Just do your best, Applejack."
Applejack says: "I'll do better than my best!"
Conductor says: "The train to Canterlot is about to leave!"

Pinkie Pie says: "What?"
Pinkie Pie says: "It gives you extra sass."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, I hope Applejack is surprised by this surprise party!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, that is the point."
Fluttershy says: "I know, but I hope she isn't so surprised she's startled, because while being surprised can be nice, being startled can be..."
Fluttershy says: "very startling."
Pinkie Pie says: "Surprise!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, Pinkie, you startled me."
Pinkie Pie says: "Sorry!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I was just practicing my "surprise!"
Pinkie Pie says: "" for when we surprise Applejack with this super cool party for becoming rodeo champeen of Equestria!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Surprise!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Quiet, Pinkie, I think Applejack's coming!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't worry, Twilight."
Pinkie Pie says: "Got my lips all limbered up!"
Ponies says: "Surprise!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Surprise!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Shoot!"
Parcel Post says: "Wow, this is the best surprise ever!"
Parcel Post says: "How did you know it was my birthday?"
Apple Bloom says: "Who's it from, Twilight?"
Apple Bloom says: "What's it say?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's from Applejack."
Twilight Sparkle says: ""Family and friends, not coming back to Ponyville."
Twilight Sparkle says: ""..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Don't worry, will send money soon."
Twilight Sparkle says: "" That's all there is."
Apple Bloom says: "Applejack's..."
Apple Bloom says: "not comin' back?"
Rainbow Dash says: "What do you mean Applejack's not coming back?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "She loves Ponyville!"
Granny Smith says: "And she loves Sweet Apple Acres!"
Apple Bloom says: "And she loves her family!"
Rarity says: "Something just dreadful must have happened to Applejack to make her not return!"
Fluttershy says: "Maybe she's hurt, or sad, or scared!"
Rainbow Dash says: "So, what are we waiting for?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Let's go find her!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Don't worry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We'll search all of Equestria if we have to."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We'll bring her back."
Apple Bloom says: "Y'all are the best."
Granny Smith says: "Thank you, girls!"
Granny Smith says: "Our little bushel just lost one apple."
Rainbow Dash says: "I hope this lead doesn't turn out to be a dead end."
Rainbow Dash says: "I don't wanna go home empty-hooved after promising we'd find her."
Fluttershy says: "I don't know how we'll break it to the Apple family."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't know how we'll break it to Ponyville!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I don't know how I'll make it to the next stop!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is Dodge Junction, girls."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack is supposed to have come here after the rodeo ended."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's fan out and try to find her."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh, pickles!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hurryhurryhurryhurryhurry!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hurry it up in there!"
Applejack says: "Huh, some ponies."
Applejack says: "Sheesh."
Pinkie Pie says: "Applejack!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her!"
Rarity says: "Oh, Applejack, thank heavens!"
Fluttershy says: "We're so glad you're safe!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Be right back."
Applejack says: "Uh, hey, everypony."
Applejack says: "What's up?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Why didn't you come back to Ponyville?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rarity says: "Yes, why are you here?"
Fluttershy says: "Are you okay?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Do you have any snacks?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Tell us what happened, Applejack!"
Cherry Jubilee says: "Applejack?"
Cherry Jubilee says: "Are these some of your Ponyville friends?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes, ma'am."
Rarity says: "And you are?"
Cherry Jubilee says: "Why, I'm Cherry Jubilee, boss of Cherry Hill Ranch."
Cherry Jubilee says: "Hasn't Applejack told ya?"
Cherry Jubilee says: "I saw her compete at the Equestria Rodeo."
Cherry Jubilee says: "Never saw anypony win so many ribbons in all my life."
Applejack says: "Aw shucks, Miss Jubilee."
Applejack says: "You don't have to go into all that."
Cherry Jubilee says: "Oh, she's so modest."
Cherry Jubilee says: "Anyway, I can always use a pony with quick hooves and a strong back."
Cherry Jubilee says: "So, when I heard Applejack was looking for a change of scenery, I snapped her up as quick as I could and brought her to Dodge Junction."
Cherry Jubilee says: "Well, I'll let you catch up with your friends."
Cherry Jubilee says: "See you back at the ranch."
Rainbow Dash says: ""Change of scenery"?"
Rainbow Dash says: "What's that supposed to mean?"
Applejack says: "S'no big deal, guys."
Applejack says: "I thought cherries would be a nice change from apples, so I took the job and came here."
Applejack says: "That's it."
Applejack says: "End of story."
Pinkie Pie says: "That's it?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, that's a terrible story!"
Applejack says: "Sorry, but that's all there is to tell."
Applejack says: "Thanks for checkin' on me, but y'all can go home now."
Applejack says: "Tell my family hi, and that I'm doing a-okay."
Rainbow Dash says: "Excuse me, AJ, but we didn't travel all over Equestria searching for you to come home without you!"
Applejack says: "Well, I didn't ask you to come lookin' for me!"
Applejack says: "There is nothin' to tell and I am not going back to Ponyville!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't care what she says."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack's not telling us something."
Rainbow Dash says: "Twilight's right."
Rainbow Dash says: "We gotta get her to spill the beans."
Pinkie Pie says: "What?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "She had beans?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ugh, I told her I was snacky!"
Cherry Jubilee says: "You ready to put your back into it, Applejack?"
Applejack says: "Sure am, Miss Jubilee."
Cherry Jubilee says: "Terr-ific."
Cherry Jubilee says: "Come on in, girls!"
Applejack says: "What are you all doing here?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We're your cherry sorters."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Shall we get started?"
Applejack says: "Fine."
Cherry Jubilee says: "Haha, red cherries go in one bin, and yellow cherries go in the other."
Cherry Jubilee says: "Simple as cherry pie."
Cherry Jubilee says: "Uh, just one teensy thing to remember â€“ have fun!"
Applejack says: "What are you five up to?"
Rarity says: "Well, uh, you made working on a cherry orchard sound..."
Rarity says: "so delightful."
Applejack says: "Uh-huh."
Applejack says: "Well, just remember: no talking about Ponyville."
Rainbow Dash says: "Fine!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Why don't you quit talking and get walking?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "So, AJ, how was Canterlot?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not talking about Ponyville, talking about Canterlot, totally different town."
Applejack says: "Canterlot was fine."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Was the rodeo fun?"
Applejack says: "Yes."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Did you meet some nice ponies there?"
Applejack says: "Some."
Rainbow Dash says: "Really?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Did you see Wild Bull Hickok?"
Rainbow Dash says: "What about Calamity Mane?"
Applejack says: "Yes, I saw 'em both."
Rarity says: "And how did you meet Miss Jubilee?"
Applejack says: "Um, well, Miss Jubilee had a cherry stand at the rodeo."
Applejack says: "Real good treats."
Fluttershy says: "Um, excuse me?"
Applejack says: "Cherry winks, cherry cheesecake, cherry tarts."
Applejack says: "We struck up a conversation, being orchard folk and all."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So you told her about Sweet Apple Acres?"
Applejack says: "Yes."
Rainbow Dash says: "Did you tell her why you weren't going back?"
Applejack says: "No, 'cuz it was none of her business!"
Fluttershy says: "Ooh..."
Fluttershy says: "Can you please slow down?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Is it because I made it rain on you that one time?"
Applejack says: "No!"
Fluttershy says: "Help!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Is it because you were insulted when I gave you that book on organized orchards?"
Applejack says: "NO!"
Rarity says: "Is it because you were insulted when I insulted your hair?"
Applejack says: "No, no, NO!"
Fluttershy says: "STOP!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, girls, we seem to be striking out."
Rainbow Dash says: "That's 'cause we're playing too nice."
Rarity says: "Yes."
Rarity says: "Desperate times do call for desperate measures."
Rainbow Dash says: "It's time to call in the big guns."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, Applejack."
Pinkie Pie says: "Need some help?"
Applejack says: "You promise not to ask me any questions?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I promise."
Pinkie Pie says: "Have you ever had a cherrychanga?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Sorry, that was a question."
Applejack says: "That kind of question is fine, Pinkie."
Applejack says: "No, I-I never had a cherrychanga."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, no wonder, because I made it up myself!"
Pinkie Pie says: "A cherrychanga is mashed up cherries in a tortilla that's deep fried."
Pinkie Pie says: "Cherrychanga."
Pinkie Pie says: "Great name, huh?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, but maybe I should call it a chimicherry."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh, that's good too."
Pinkie Pie says: "Which do you think sounds better?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Cherrychanga or chimicherry?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Or what if I combine them?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Chimicherrychanga!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What sounds the funniest?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I like funny words!"
Pinkie Pie says: "One of my favorite funny words is 'kumquat'!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I didn't make that one up."
Pinkie Pie says: "I would work in a kumquat orchard just so I could say 'kumquat' all day!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Kumquat, kumquat, kumquat!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And 'pickle barrel'!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Isn't that just the funnest thing to say?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pickle barrel, pickle barrel, pickle barrel!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Say it with me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, chimicherrychanga!"
Applejack says: "No!"
Applejack says: "Make it stop, make it stop!"
Rainbow Dash says: "The only way to make it stop is for you to spill the beans!"
Applejack says: "Never!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Speaking of beans, did you ever realize how many words rhyme with 'beans'?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Lean, mean, spleen, unclean, bean..."
Applejack says: "Alright, alright!"
Applejack says: "I'll tell everypony what's goin' on!"
Applejack says: "Just please stop talkin'!"
Applejack says: "But..."
Applejack says: "can it wait 'til tomorrow at breakfast?"
Applejack says: "I'm plum tuckered out."
Rainbow Dash says: "Tomorrow, huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I don't know..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Do you Pinkie promise?"
Applejack says: "I will tell you the whole truth at breakfast."
Applejack says: "Pinkie promise."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm glad we're finally gonna get some answers from Applejack."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, maybe."
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't worry, Rainbow."
Pinkie Pie says: "She's gotta 'fess up after making a Pinkie promise."
Pinkie Pie says: "Good morning, Applejack."
Pinkie Pie says: "Nopony breaks a Pinkie promise!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Applejack!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You Pinkie promised!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Applejack, come back here!"
Applejack says: "Giddy up, fellas, I gotta get the heck out of Dodge!"
Pinkie Pie says: "She's gonna get away!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh no, she won't!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Look, girls!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Follow that stagecoach!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, we have you now!"
Applejack says: "Whoa!"
Applejack says: "What the hay?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pull over!"
Applejack says: "Hey!"
Applejack says: "Cut that out!"
Applejack says: "Whoa!"
Applejack says: "I'll pay you double to outrun them."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We'll pay you triple to slow down!"
Applejack says: "I'll pay you quadruple to leave them in the dust!"
Rarity says: "That was rude!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Get them!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Get them!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on, Fluttershy!"
Applejack says: "Hyah!"
Applejack says: "C'mon, y'all!"
Applejack says: "Go, go!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Applejack, you broke your Pinkie promise!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Apologize!"
Applejack says: "Pinkie, I did not break my promise!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wha?"
Applejack says: "If y'all reckon back, I told you that I would tell you everything at breakfast."
Applejack says: "But I didn't come for breakfast."
Applejack says: "I couldn't come to that breakfast, not if it meant telling y'all what happened."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, I..."
Pinkie Pie says: "I..."
Applejack says: "I'm sorry, Pinkie, but I can't tell y'all the truth."
Applejack says: "I just can't!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well I heard a "sorry" in there, so that'll have to do for now."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'll get a real apology later."
Pinkie Pie says: "Rarity, catch me."
Rarity says: "What?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow, go back!"
Rainbow Dash says: "No time!"
Rainbow Dash says: "They knew what they were getting into!"
Applejack says: "Yes."
Applejack says: "Hyah!"
Applejack says: "Yee-haw!"
Coach ponies says: "Lady, you're trouble."
Applejack says: "Ha, try and catch me now."
Applejack says: "Oh, nuts."
Rainbow Dash says: "Not so fast!"
Applejack says: "Fine."
Applejack says: "Now you know."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Know what?"
Applejack says: "Well, just look!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I am."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You won an amazing number of ribbons, just like Miss Jubilee said!"
Applejack says: "Don't you get it?"
Applejack says: "There's every color of ribbon down there."
Applejack says: "Every color..."
Applejack says: "but..."
Applejack says: "blue."
Applejack says: "I came in fourth, third, even second, but I didn't win one first prize, and I certainly didn't win any prize money."
Rainbow Dash says: "But the telegram said you were gonna send money."
Applejack says: "That's why I came here."
Applejack says: "I wanted to earn some money."
Applejack says: "After that big old send off Ponyville gave me, I just didn't have the nerve to come home empty-hooved."
Applejack says: "I couldn't come home a failure."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack, you're not a failure."
Rainbow Dash says: "And we're your friends!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We don't care if you came in fiftieth place!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You're still number one in our books."
Applejack says: "So..."
Applejack says: "you're not upset or disappointed?"
Fluttershy says: "Nn-nn."
Rainbow Dash says: "Nn-nn."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nn-nn."
Applejack says: "But what about the mayor?"
Applejack says: "I don't think I can face her and tell her I didn't get that money to fix the broken roof."
Fluttershy says: "Applejack, we can always find a way to fix that hole in the roof."
Fluttershy says: "But if you don't come back, we'll never be able to fix the hole in our hearts."
Rainbow Dash says: "Darn it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Now you got me acting all sappy!"
It's a tad easier to be proud when you come in first than it is when you finish further back. But there's no reason to hide when you don't do as well as you'd hoped. You can't run away from your problems. Better to run to your friends and family.
Pinkie Pie says: "What do you think, Rarity?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Chimicherry or cherrychanga?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Chimicherry, cherrychanga?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Chimicherry, cherrychanga?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Chimicherry, cherrychanga?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Chimicherry, cherrychanga?"
Rarity says: "When I get back, you're gonna get it, Rainbow Dash!"
