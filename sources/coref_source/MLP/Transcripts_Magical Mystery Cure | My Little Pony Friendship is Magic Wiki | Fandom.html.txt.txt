Morning in Ponyville shimmers.
Morning in Ponyville shines.
And I know for absolute certain.
That everything is certainly fine.
There's the Mayor en route to her office.
There's the sofa clerk selling some quills.
Davenport says: "Morning, kid!"
Twilight Sparkle.
My Ponyville is so gentle and still.
Can things ever go wrong?
I don't think that they will.
Morning in Ponyville shimmers.

Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash, that's not funny!"
Rarity says: "Terribly sorry, darling."
Rarity says: "I'm afraid I'm..."
Rarity says: "I'm not good with the thundery ones."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Something tells me everything is not going to be fine."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are you doing?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What happened to your cutie mark?"
Rarity says: "Whatever do you mean, Twilight?"
Rarity says: "I'm simply doing what I've done since the day it first appeared."
Rarity says: "Does my sky look fabulous or what?"
Rarity says: "Too last season?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where is Rainbow Dash?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why isn't she handling this?"
Spike says: "I still don't know what you had to wake me up for."
Spike says: "I love sleeping in the rain."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's not about the weather, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rarity had Rainbow Dash's cutie mark and said this was Rainbow Dash's cottage."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Something strange is going on..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, guys."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why is Rarity doing your job?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And what in Equestria is going on in..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "here?"
Rainbow Dash.
These animals don't listen, no, not one little bit.
They run around out of control and throw their hissy fits.
It's up to me to stop them, 'cause plainly you can see.
It's got to be my destiny, and it's what my cutie mark is telling me.
Fluttershy.
I try to keep them laughing, put a smile upon their face.
But no matter what I try, it seems a bit of a disgrace.
I have to entertain them, it's there for all to see.
It's got to be my destiny, and it's what my cutie mark is telling me.
Pinkie Pie.
I don't care much for pickin' fruit and plowin' fields ain't such a hoot.
No matter what I try, I cannot fix this busted water chute!
I've got so many chores to do, it's no fun being me.
But it has to be my destiny, 'cause it's what my cutie mark is telling me.
Applejack.
Lookie here at what I made, I think that it's a dress.
I know it doesn't look like much, I'm under some distress.
Could y'all give me a hand here and help me fix this mess?
My destiny is not pretty, but it's what my cutie mark is tellin' me.
Rarity.
I'm in love with weather patterns, but the others have concerns.
For I just gave them frostbite over top of their sunburns.
I have to keep on trying, for everyone can see.
Rarity and Rainbow Dash.
It's got to be.
Fluttershy.
It's got to be.
Pinkie Pie.
My destiny.
Applejack.
My destiny.
Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy.
And it's what my cutie mark.
Pinkie Pie and Applejack.
It's what my cutie mark.
Rarity, Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Applejack.
Yes, it's what my cutie mark is telling me!
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is bad."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is very, very bad."
Spike says: "What's going on?"
Spike says: "Why is this happening?!"
Spike says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Last night when you were taking one of your seven-hour bubble baths, I got a special delivery from the princess."
The spell contained on the last page of this book is Star Swirl the Bearded's secret unfinished masterpiece. gasps Ooh! He was never able to get it right, and thus abandoned it. I believe you are the only pony who can understand and rewrite it. Princess Celestia.
From one to another, another to one. A mark of one's destiny singled out alone, fulfilled. That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't even rhyme!
Twilight Sparkle says: "I cast the spell so I could find out what it was, but nothing seemed to happen."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But now I know something did happen."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The spell has changed the Elements of Harmony!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That must be why their cutie marks are all wrong!"
Spike says: "So just cast a counter-spell to switch them back."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "There is no counter-spell!"
Spike says: "Why don't you just use that memory spell you used to fix everypony when Discord was here?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's not their memories, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's their true selves that have been altered!"
Spike says: "Zecora's cure for the cutie pox?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That won't work either..."
Spike says: "Well , maybe it won't be so bad."
Spike says: "Maybe our friends will grow to like their new lives."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "They're not who they are meant to be anymore."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Their destinies are now changed, and it's all my fault."
Twilight Sparkle.
I have to find a way.
To make this all okay.
I can't believe this small mistake.
Could've caused so much heartache.
Oh why, oh why?
Losing promise.
I don't know what to do.
Seeking answers.
I fear I won't get through to you.
Oh why, oh why?
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Spike, what have I done?"
Spike says: "Aw, come on, Twilight, you'll figure out a way to fix this."
Spike says: "These are your friends."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're right, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And they mean more to me than anything."
Twilight Sparkle says: "My friends..."
Spike says: "Twilight?"
Spike says: "Are you alright?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've got it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know what to do!"
Spike says: "You do?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I may not be able to remind them of who they are, but I can show them what they mean to each other."
Twilight Sparkle says: "They'll find the part of themselves that's been lost so they can help the friend they care about so much!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Come on, Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy, wait!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh..."
Fluttershy says: "Hey, Twilight..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where are you going?"
Fluttershy says: "I'm moving back to Cloudsdale."
Fluttershy says: "I don't know what's wrong, but I can't seem to make anypony laugh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Before you go, I was wondering if you might be willing to help Rainbow Dash."
Twilight Sparkle says: "She's really struggling with her animals."
Fluttershy says: "But..."
Fluttershy says: "I don't really know anything about animals..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But you do know something about Rainbow Dash."
Fluttershy says: "I..."
Fluttershy says: "know that she's a true friend, and I'll do anything I can to help her."
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm in here!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Help!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm trapped!"
Fluttershy says: "Hurry, Twilight!"
Fluttershy says: "Can't you do some sort of spell to get her out?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy, you're the only one who can help!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash needs you!"
Fluttershy says: "Um..."
Fluttershy says: "Hello?"
Fluttershy says: "Little..."
Fluttershy says: "woodland creatures?"
Fluttershy says: "I know that you're all very upset and feel like giving Rainbow Dash a hard time, but we'd all really appreciate it if you'd calm down and, um, maybe..."
Fluttershy says: "rest for a bit?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh!"
Fluttershy says: "Uh..."
Fluttershy says: "look!"
Fluttershy says: "Here's some nice, juicy leaves for you to munch on."
Fluttershy says: "And some crunchy, munchy acorns too."
Fluttershy says: "Uh, wouldn't you like to take a break and have a little snack?"
Fluttershy says: "Aww, look at that."
Fluttershy says: "I guess you were all just cranky because you were hungry."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, you are very welcome, little friends."
Fluttershy says: "Goodness, it's like I can understand them!"
Fluttershy says: "I..."
Fluttershy says: "I feel strange, like..."
Fluttershy says: "like this is what I'm meant to do, like this is who I am!"
Fluttershy says: "My destiny!"
Fluttershy says: "Wha..."
Fluttershy says: "what happened?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy, look!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Your cutie mark!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It worked!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It worked!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, I'm so happy you're back to normal!"
