Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, you really need to go to sleep!"
Spike says: "Aw, two more minutes, Twilight!"
Spike says: "I'm just getting to the really good part!"
Spike says: "The Mane-iac is about to—"
Twilight Sparkle says: ""The Mane-iac"?"
Spike says: "The Power Ponies' most evil nemesis!"
Spike says: "She was the power-mad owner of a hair-care product company."
Spike says: "A tragic accident at her shampoo factory in Maretropolis not only gave her mane strange new powers, but also caused her to go completely insane!"
Spike says: "She and her henchponies are planning to break into the Maretropolis Museum and steal the Electro-Orb, so she can use it to power up her doomsday device!"
Spike says: "Of course, the Mane-iac wouldn't have even known if Hum Drum hadn't slipped up and told her all about it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hum Drum?"
Spike says: "Nah, the guy in the blue boots and pointless red cape."
Spike says: "The Power Ponies' bumbling and totally useless sidekick."
Spike says: "The Power Ponies have to stop the Mane-iac or Maretropolis is doo-hoo-hoo-hoomed!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Believe me, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If anypony understands what it's like to get caught up in a really good book, it's me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But if we're going to make any progress fixing up Luna and Celestia's old castle tomorrow, we all have to do our part."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We don't want to be too tired to lend a hoof..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "or claw."
Spike says: "Okay, okay, I'm going to bed."
Spike says: "Goodnight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Two more minutes."
Spike says: "Yes!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Looking good, everypony!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's keep this magical makeover moving!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You got it!"
Spike says: "Good old Spike is here, ready to do his part!"
Pinkie Pie says: "A little more to the left!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No, the other left!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Awesome!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's perfect right where it is!"
Pinkie Pie says: "On to the next painting!"
Spike says: "You sure you don't need any help?"
Applejack says: "Nah, that's okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "We have everything under control!"
Spike says: "Dash?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm good!"
Spike says: "Isn't there anything I can help you with, Twilight?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't worry about it, Spike!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's all good!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I think she's right."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It looks like we've got it, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Looking great, everypony!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why don't you find a quiet spot and finish reading your comic?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Aren't you right at the part where Hum Drum was about to stop the villain?"
Spike says: "Hum Drum never stops the villain."
Spike says: "He's just there for comic relief."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rarity, lemme give you a hoof with that!"
Spike says: "I could do it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's okay, Spike."
Pinkie Pie says: "Pony power!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Weehee!!"
Spike says: "Wait."
Spike says: "What?"
Spike says: "How can that be the end?!"
Spike says: "!"
Spike says: "What's..."
Spike says: "that?"
Spike says: ""You can..."
Spike says: "retr-" What?"
Spike says: ""You can..."
Spike says: "return..."
Spike says: "" Urgh!"
Spike says: "I know I saw a magnifying glass laying around the last time I was here..."
Applejack says: "Spike!"
Applejack says: "Where are ya, Spike?"
Rarity says: "We're breaking for tea and biscuits!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Spike!"
Spike says: ""You can return to the place you started when the Mane-iac is..."
Spike says: "defeated."
Spike says: "" Huh?"
Spike says: ""Take a closer look to join the adventure in this book"?"
Spike says: "What does that even mean?"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "Cool!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are you—"
Spike says: "Heeeeeelp!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Weehee!"
Spike says: "Is this..."
Spike says: "Maretropolis?"
Applejack says: "Somepony wanna tell me what the hay is goin' on?"
Spike says: "Holy new personas, ponies!"
Spike says: "You're the..."
Spike says: "Masked Matter-Horn!"
Spike says: "Fili-Second!"
Spike says: "Zapp!"
Spike says: "R-Radiance!"
Spike says: "Mistress Mare-velous!"
Spike says: "Saddle Rager!"
Spike says: "You're the..."
Spike says: "Power Ponies!"
Mane-iac says: "Power Ponies!"
Mane-iac says: "How kind of you to join us!"
Main cast says: "Huh?"
Applejack says: "Did she just call us..."
Applejack says: "Power Ponies?"
Spike says: "You're the..."
Spike says: "the superheroes from my comic book!"
Spike says: "It somehow zapped us all in here!"
Rainbow Dash says: "So somepony zap us back out!"
Spike says: "My comic book!"
Spike says: "It said the way to get back to where we started was to defeat the Mane-iac!"
Spike says: "Your arch-nemesis!"
Mane-iac says: "Time for the mane event!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Where'd she go?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wheeeeeeee!"
Spike says: "She could be miles away from here by now!"
Spike says: "Pinkie is Fili-Second, the fastest pony in all of Maretropolis!"
Applejack says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "Twilight!"
Spike says: "Freeze her mane!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Do what?"
Spike says: "You're the Masked Matter-Horn!"
Spike says: "You can shoot all kinds of crazy power beams from your horn!"
Mane-iac says: "You know, I'm beginning to enjoy this."
Spike says: "Dash!"
Spike says: "Quick!"
Spike says: "You're Zapp, and your superpower is controlling the mighty forces of nature!"
Spike says: "Unholster the lightning bolt!"
Spike says: "Lightning, not a tornado!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa-whoa!"
Spike says: "Fluttershy!"
Spike says: "You're Saddle Rager!"
Spike says: "Lose your temper, and you'll turn into a huge, super-strong monster!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, gosh!"
Fluttershy says: "That wouldn't..."
Fluttershy says: "be very..."
Fluttershy says: "polite!"
Spike says: "Ugh!"
Spike says: "Rarity!"
Spike says: "Use your jewelry to create attack constructs!"
Rarity says: "What's an attack construct?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Spike says: "Just think of something, anything, and your bracelet makes it appear!"
Spike says: "Something useful!"
Spike says: "The Electro-Orb!"
Mane-iac says: "Well, this has been quite the mane-raising experience."
Mane-iac says: "But I really must be going."
Mane-iac says: "Why, thank you, Hum Drum!"
Spike says: "I'm Hum Drum..."
Spike says: "?!"
Spike says: "!"
Spike says: "Oh no..."
Spike says: "Applejack!"
Spike says: "You gotta..."
Spike says: "help stop the..."
Spike says: "tornado from destroying.."
Spike says: "the city!"
Applejack says: "But every time I move, this darn lasso gets tighter!"
Spike says: "You're psychically connected to it!"
Spike says: "Will it to where you want it to go, and it'll obey you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That was spin-tastic!"
Applejack says: "Lemme get this straight: We've been sucked into some kind of comic-book world?"
Spike says: "Technically, it's called Maretropolis."
Spike says: "And if we wanna get back to Ponyville, I think we have to stop the Mane-iac from using her doomsday device to destroy it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "No biggie."
Rainbow Dash says: "I was already awesome."
Rainbow Dash says: "And now we've all got superpowers!"
Spike says: "Almost all of us have superpowers..."
Rarity says: "But you must have them too, Spikey-boo."
Rarity says: "Your character is wearing a cape!"
Spike says: "Yeah, for absolutely no reason."
Spike says: "He's pretty much useless..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Good thing you're not really Hum Drum, then."
Spike says: "Yeah, good thing..."
Rainbow Dash says: "So the six of us Power Ponies will take care of Mane-iac, and get us back to Ponyville!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, where is the Mane-iac building her doomsday device?"
Spike says: "Her top-secret headquarters!"
Spike says: "But you'd better get there quick."
Spike says: "That glowing orb she just stole is what she's going to use to power it up!"
Applejack says: "Lead the way, Spike!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Then leave the rest to us!"
Spike says: "There it is!"
Applejack says: "Is that a..."
Applejack says: "shampoo factory?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "All right, Power Ponies, here's the plan."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rarity, you, me and—"
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on out, Mane-iac!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Or the Power Ponies are comin' in!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "So much for "element of surprise"."
Spike says: "Guess I'll just hang back here doing nothing."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, I don't think she's home."
Fluttershy says: "Maybe we should just come back later."
Rarity says: "She's home."
Applejack says: "Time to Power Pony up!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Nice catchphrase!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Freeze ray!"
Rarity says: "It's an improvement, darling."
Rarity says: "Ooh, I do so love a functional accessory!"
Henchpony says: "My hair!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Seriously?"
Rainbow Dash says: "You aren't even just a little angry right now?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nice work, Power Ponies!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now let's take care of the Mane-iac and get ourselves home!"
Mane-iac says: "I don't think so!"
Mane-iac says: "I have a city to destroy, and I'm not about to let the Power Ponies stop me!"
Mane-iac says: "Not this time!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Just watch us!"
Spike says: "The Hairspray Ray of Doom!"
Spike says: "It stops you in your tracks and renders your powers useless!"
Rarity says: "We'll just see about that!"
Spike says: "Fluttershy, please!"
Spike says: "Just a little anger?!"
Spike says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Well, I'm not so much angry as I am concerned, bordering on terrified!"
Spike says: "Don't spray!"
Mane-iac says: "Oh, Hum Drum, why in all of Maretropolis would I use the Hairspray Ray of Doom on you?"
Mane-iac says: "Rather pointless, don't you think?"
Spike says: "What am I supposed to do?"
Spike says: "I'm useless."
Spike says: "No wonder my friends never need me to do anything important."
Spike says: "They're the ones with superpowers."
Spike says: "They've probably already figured out how to escape."
Spike says: "Or not!"
Mane-iac says: "Congratulations, Power Ponies!"
Fluttershy says: "Ahem."
Fluttershy says: "I don't mean to interrupt, but aren't you forgetting about somepony?"
Mane-iac says: "Hum Drum?"
Mane-iac says: "Little guy?"
Mane-iac says: "No superpowers whatsoever?"
Mane-iac says: "He's utterly useless!"
Mane-iac says: "Puh-lease."
Mane-iac says: "Everypony knows you just keep him around because you  feel sowwy for him."
Mane-iac says: "Wah."
Mane-iac says: "Wah."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Maybe in your world."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But in our world, Spike—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "uh, Hum Drum always comes through when we need him!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Always!"
Spike says: "I'm not like Hum Drum!"
Spike says: "When my friends really need me, I do come through!"
Spike says: "And they need me now!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Way to go, Spike!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Get mad!"
Fluttershy says: "I'm trying!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Tag you're it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Tag you're it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Tag you're it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Tag you're it!"
Mane-iac says: "Over there!"
Mane-iac says: "There!"
Mane-iac says: "There!"
Mane-iac says: "Idiots!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Need a place to put these guys!"
Applejack says: "Hold it right there, partner!"
Wilhelm scream.
Spike says: "Fluttershy, where are you going?"
Fluttershy says: "You seem to have everything under control."
Spike says: "Fluttershy, we need you!"
Spike says: "You have to power up!"
Fluttershy says: "I'm sorry, it's just that nothing is making me mad."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, goodness!"
Fluttershy says: "Are you okay?"
Mane-iac says: "My mane!"
Spike says: "Once again, the day is saved by—"
Rainbow Dash says: "Awesome!"
Applejack says: "Whoo-ee!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Did you see how I was raining down a storm of justice at the end there?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Applejack says: "You catch how I was wieldin' that lasso?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Cupcakes?"
Rarity says: "How did you—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Eh, we had a good half second before we got sucked back out of the comic, and the Maretropolis bakery was only sixty-five blocks away!"
Spike says: "I'm just glad to be back."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We wouldn't have made it without you, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And I hope you realize that just because we don't always need your help, it doesn't mean that we don't think you're helpful."
Spike says: "And that you don't have to have superpowers to be a super friend."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But I do have one question."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where exactly did you get that comic book?"
Spike says: "This one I got in Canterlot at the House of Enchanted Comics."
Spike says: "Well, I didn't know it meant they were literally enchanted!"
Spike says: "I thought it just meant, like, the comics they sold there had really enchanting storylines!"
Spike says: "Hey, wait up!"
Spike says: "I'm an important part of this team, remember?!"
Spike says: "!"
