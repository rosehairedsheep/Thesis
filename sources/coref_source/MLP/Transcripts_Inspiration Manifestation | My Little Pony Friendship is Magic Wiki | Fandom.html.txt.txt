Pinkie Pie says: "Hear ye, hear ye!"
Pinkie Pie says: "The Ponyville Foal and Filly Fair is almost ready to begin!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whee, ha-ha, whoa!"
Rarity says: "Just because the attendees are young doesn't mean they don't deserve my very best creative work."
Rarity says: "Why, this puppet theater is going to be the talk of the Foal and Filly Fair!"
Spike says: "How could it not be?"
Spike says: "You're the one making it..."
Rarity says: "Oh!"
Rarity says: "But I couldn't have done it without the help of one of my dearest and most supportive friends!"
Rarity says: "You are my favorite dragon."
Spike says: "Your favorite dragon?"
Spike says: "Aw, gee..."
Rarity says: "The hours have been long, the work taxing beyond compare, but it will all be worth it when we hear those three little words!"
Claude says: "This is awful!"
Rarity says: "Awful?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Claude says: "And completely unusable."
Claude says: "Hmmm..."
Claude says: "Ugh!"
Claude says: "It doesn't travel!"
Claude says: "Oh, there's no room for my puppets!"
Claude says: "It appears I won't have a traveling puppet theater to use after all."
Spike says: "I don't know what that guy was talking about."
Spike says: "This thing is perfect!"
Rarity says: "This is terrible, simply terrible!"
Spike says: "So that puppeteer didn't like your exquisitely crafted best puppet theater in the history of puppet theaters puppet theater."
Spike says: "You can just contribute something else to the Foal and Filly Fair."
Spike says: "Argh, there's gotta be something in here somewhere."
Spike says: "It's not "who", it's "what"!"
Spike says: "Like, what can help Rarity make something in time for the fair?"
Spike says: "She really, really, really wants to make a creative contribution."
Spike says: "She said I'm her favorite dragon, so it's up to me to come through for her in her time of need."
Spike says: "There's gotta be some kind of spell that'll do the trick."
Spike says: "Come on, help a dragon out!"
Spike says: "Ugh!"
Spike says: "It's not for me!"
Spike says: "It's for Rarity!"
Spike says: "The one who made you that bow tie you like so much?"
Spike says: "Okay, I get it."
Spike says: "You don't think we should use magic– What is that?"
Spike says: "What?"
Spike says: "If I wasn't supposed to have it, it wouldn't be so easy to get."
Spike says: "And it's covered in spikes, like me."
Spike says: ""Inspiration Manifestation: Instantly brings ideas to life."
Spike says: "I'm likin' the looks of this one."
Spike says: "Hmmm."
Spike says: "Rarity!"
Rarity says: "Leave me be!"
Rarity says: "Can't you see how distraught, disappointed, and downtrodden I still am?"
Spike says: "But I brought you something."
Rarity says: "Unless it's another carton of vanilla oat swirl or word that the festival has been cancelled, I don't think I'm interested."
Spike says: "It's magic!"
Rarity says: "Spike, precious scales, I already have magic."
Spike says: "But not the kind that can help you create something in time for the fair."
Spike says: "This can!"
Rarity says: "I suppose it's worth a try."
Rarity says: ""From in the head to out in the world, every thought to action."
Rarity says: "Hold close this book and through its spell, you'll start a chain reaction, projecting forth whatever beauty you see."
Rarity says: "Only when true words are spoken will you finally be set free."
Spike says: "Did it work?"
Rarity says: "Hm, there's only one way to find out."
Rarity says: "Oh, my!"
Rarity says: "I thought about making this a much more beautiful spell book, and I have!"
Rarity says: "Dear, dear Spike!"
Rarity says: "Here I was about to give up, but like a true friend, you've come through with flying colors!"
Rarity says: "Come!"
Rarity says: "We must find the puppeteer right away, so that I may provide him with the most fabulous theater he's ever imagined!"
Rarity says: "Or, should I say, that I've ever imagined."
Claude says: "Ah, Miss Rarity, come to see the show, I presume?"
Claude says: "You'll notice I had to make do in light of your recent failure to produce a functioning theater."
Rarity says: "Oh, but I think you'll find the new one I've created will be much more to your liking!"
Claude says: "Ah, well, it is gorgeous, but that was never the problem now, was it?"
Claude says: "Oh, well, this one does seem to travel."
Claude says: "Plenty of room for my puppets..."
Claude says: "I say, Miss Rarity, I don't know how you managed to do so in such a short amount of time, but you seem to have redeemed yourself."
Claude says: "How did you manage to do so in such a short time?"
Rarity says: "A good designer never reveals her tricks."
Rarity says: "Thank you again, Spike, for being such a dear friend and finding this book for me!"
Spike says: "My pleasure."
Spike says: "Well, guess I can return it now that the fair's over."
Rarity says: "Oh, yes, of course."
Rarity says: "I've made my creative contribution as I'd hoped to do, and all is well!"
Rarity says: "Uh, then again, perhaps I should keep it just a skotch longer..."
Rarity says: "You don't mind, do you, Spike?"
Spike says: "Of course not!"
Spike says: "See you tomorrow!"
Spike says: "What?"
Spike says: "She'll keep it for a few more hours, no harm in that."
Spike says: "Rarity?"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Rarity says: "Spike, I'm so glad you're here!"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "Are..."
Spike says: "you okay?"
Rarity says: "Oh, I've never been better!"
Rarity says: "This book you've given me is amazing!"
Rarity says: "Why, I, I, I, I've been up all night just creating and creating and creating and creating!"
Rarity says: "I've completed my fall line for the next fifteen seasons!"
Spike says: "Wow!"
Rarity says: "But then I started thinking, 'why stop there'?"
Rarity says: "Oh, Spike, I've always thought this town of ours could use a few beautifying upgrades, and with this book, I can make that happen with such ease!"
Rarity says: "You will support me in this endeavor by letting me keep the book just a little longer?"
Spike says: "Of course I will!"
Spike says: "What do you say we get a little breakfast before we get started?"
Rarity says: "No time for breakfast!"
Rarity says: "I want to get started right away!"
Spike says: "Technically, we do have time, because with that book held close, you can just make things– Rarity?"
Rarity says: "Now, this is exactly what I'm talking about!"
Rarity says: "Why, that cart hasn't an ounce of stylish flair!"
Granny Smith says: "My eyes playin' tricks on me again?"
Applejack says: "What in rhubarb pie just happened?"
Rarity says: "Isn't it gorgeous?"
Spike says: "It's amazing!"
Spike says: "You should ask Applejack if she wants you to give all the Apple family carts a makeover!"
Rarity says: "Oh, I don't really think I need to ask permission, darling."
Rarity says: "Everyone loves surprises, especially when they're gorgeous ones!"
Spike says: "You're right!"
Spike says: "Everypony does love surprises."
Rarity says: "Won't that be a fun little secret for the three of us to share?"
Spike says: "The..."
Spike says: "three of us?"
Rarity says: "You, me, and the book, of course."
Rarity says: "My marvelous, marvelous book!"
Spike says: "..."
Spike says: "Of course."
Rarity says: "Promise me you won't say a word to anypony?"
Spike says: "You got it!"
Rarity says: "I knew I could count on you, Spike."
Rarity says: "And I also know just what I want to do next!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What in the..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Get..."
Rainbow Dash says: "it..."
Rainbow Dash says: "off..."
Rainbow Dash says: "me!"
Rarity says: "I've always thought Rainbow Dash could use a little more glamor, and now look at her!"
Rarity says: "Cloud-busting with style!"
Rarity says: "Moving on!"
Spike says: "She'll be fine."
Spike says: "It's just a dress."
Spike says: "Uh, wait for your favorite dragon!"
Fluttershy says: "La la-la la-la la-la la la..."
Fluttershy says: "There you go, Mr."
Fluttershy says: "Robin!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, my goodness!"
Fluttershy says: "You're lost?"
Fluttershy says: "No, not that way, that looks like it's the door to a..."
Fluttershy says: "bedroom."
Fluttershy says: "Try that one over there."
Fluttershy says: "No, no, that leads to a..."
Fluttershy says: "Shoe closet?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, dear."
Fluttershy says: "Maybe try the staircase?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, no-no-no, the other staircase."
Rarity says: "Isn't it gorgeous?"
Spike says: "It's probably the most beautiful birdhouse ever created."
Rarity says: "Go on."
Spike says: "I'm just not sure how the bird feels about it."
Rarity says: "Pfft, what does a bird know about architectural design?"
Rarity says: "What matters is what you think, Spike."
Rarity says: "And you love it."
Rarity says: "Don't you?"
Spike says: "Of course I do."
Spike says: "It's so..."
Spike says: "Rarity."
Rarity says: "It is, isn't it?"
Rarity says: "Ooh!"
Rarity says: "Oh, adorable!"
Rarity says: "But it could use a touch of class, don't you think?"
Spike says: "Oh yeah, definitely."
Rarity says: "This party doesn't even seem to have a proper theme."
Rarity says: "Let's do something about that, shall we?"
Spike says: "You've already made things look really really great."
Spike says: "Maybe you should stop while you're ahead?"
Rarity says: "You're right, Spike!"
Rarity says: "There's so much to do elsewhere!"
Spike says: "Right!"
Spike says: "Elsewhere..."
Rarity says: "Just one more little thing before we go..."
Rarity says: "Why, this party is certain to make the society page now."
Rarity says: "Won't Pinkie Pie be pleased?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Happy, happy day to– huh?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Rarity says: "I am simply buzzing with ideas."
Rarity says: "Simply buzzing!"
Spike says: "That's great!"
Spike says: "But, uh, you've been at this for a while now."
Spike says: "How 'bout you take a break?"
Spike says: "Give that brilliant mind of yours a rest?"
Rarity says: "Don't be silly!"
Rarity says: "I'm not going to stop now!"
Rarity says: "Why, I won't stop until every inch of Ponyville has benefited from my creative vision!"
Rarity says: "Starting with you, Spike!"
Rarity says: "You look fabulous!"
Spike says: "All because of you, heh..."
Rarity says: "Anything for my favorite dragon and most supportive friend."
Rarity says: "Come, there's so much more to do!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh no, not you too!"
Spike says: "What do you mean, not me too?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh."
Spike says: "What?"
Spike says: "This?"
Spike says: "I just wanted to try out a new look."
Spike says: "You like?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hmm..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, in that case, have you seen anypony suspicious around?"
Spike says: "Uh, nope."
Mayor Mare says: "Princess Twilight, the gazebo has been turned into solid crystal, and two ponies are now trapped inside its walls!"
Spike says: "No!"
Spike says: "I made a promise to Rarity to keep this to myself!"
Spike says: "But you're right, Owlowiscious."
Spike says: "I have to tell."
Spike says: "And once I do, I can forget Rarity thinking of me as her most supportive friend..."
Spike says: "I can forget Rarity thinking of me as a friend at all..."
Spike says: "I can't do it."
Spike says: "I promised I'd keep all of this between the three of us!"
Spike says: "Of course it's weird she meant her, me and the spell book."
Spike says: "But– The spellbook!"
Spike says: "Of course!"
Spike says: "If I can get it away from her, I bet she won't be able to use its magic anymore!"
Spike says: "Oh, come on, it's the perfect plan!"
Spike says: "I..."
Spike says: "just have to figure out which way she went."
Stallion says: "I can't see!"
Spike says: "I'm thinking she's headed this way."
Rarity says: "What do you think you're doing?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Spike says: "Uh, me?"
Spike says: "I was just, uh..."
Spike says: "basking in your creative radiance."
Rarity says: "Oh, Spike, you do say the nicest things."
Spike says: "Thanks."
Rarity says: "Now, where was I?"
Rarity says: "Oh yes!"
Rarity says: "Gold-plated rooftops for everypony!"
Rarity says: "Spike!"
Rarity says: "I have just had the most marvelous idea!"
Spike says: "Of course you have."
Spike says: "You're Rarity."
Rarity says: "My work here in Ponyville is nearly complete."
Rarity says: "Don't you think it's time the rest of Equestria benefited from my creative vision?"
Spike says: "Absolutely!"
Rarity says: "Ooh, I'm thinking we go by chariot!"
Rarity says: "Or, as everyone will soon be calling them, "Rariot"!"
Spike says: "Huh?!"
Spike says: "!"
Spike says: "How..."
Spike says: "how did you..."
Spike says: "do that?"
Rarity says: "Why, whatever do you mean?"
Spike says: "The book!"
Spike says: "It's– I mean– you don't– it's gone!"
Spike says: "The book is gone!"
Rarity says: "Gone?"
Rarity says: "Why, it's right there."
Spike says: "Why would I do anything with your book?"
Spike says: "We're friends!"
Spike says: "It..."
Spike says: "it was probably the owl!"
Rarity says: "But, wait..."
Rarity says: "I don't seem to need it anymore, do I?"
Rarity says: "Yes..."
Rarity says: "yes..."
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "I can feel its magic flowing within me now!"
Rarity says: "I'm so excited!"
Rarity says: "I'm so excited!"
Spike says: "I'm so scared."
Rarity says: "Oh, the places we'll go, Spike!"
Rarity says: "Manehattan, Fillydelphia, Canterlot!"
Rarity says: "And there you'll be by my side, just as you've always been here in Ponyville, your constant praise and adoration driving me to even greater heights, until there isn't an inch of Equestria that hasn't been utterly transformed by my creative genius!"
Spike says: "..."
Spike says: "No."
Rarity says: "What did you say?"
Spike says: "I said 'no'."
Spike says: "You've been changing things, but you haven't been making them better."
Spike says: "I should have told you the truth at the very beginning, but I didn't because I was trying to be a supportive friend."
Spike says: "But instead, I let you become something awful."
Rarity says: "Awful?"
Rarity says: "Ugh..."
Rarity says: "what happened?"
Spike says: "Rarity!"
Spike says: "You're okay?"
Rarity says: "I..."
Rarity says: "I think so..."
Rarity says: "though by the looks of it, something quite terrifying has happened to Ponyville."
Spike says: "You happened."
Rarity says: "Me?"
Spike says: "The last part of the spell!"
Rarity says: "Only when true words are spoken will you finally be set free."
Spike says: "The spell took over you, and you wanted to change everything in Equestria."
Spike says: "I was afraid to tell you how I really felt about it, but then I..."
Spike says: "I told you the truth."
Rarity says: "Dearest Spike, you should never be afraid to tell me the truth."
Rarity says: "We're friends, remember?"
Spike says: "Today I learned how important it is to be honest with your friends when they're doing something that you don't think is right."
Spike says: "A true friend knows that you're speaking up because you care about them."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Never, ever, ever, ever take another book out of the library at the castle without asking!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Princess Cadance and Princess Luna have much better things to do than help me clean up Ponyville!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Do you have any idea how hard it was to reverse that much dark magic?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Spike says: "You don't look so good."
Spike says: "What?"
Spike says: "I'm just being honest!"
Spike says: "It's what good friends do!"
