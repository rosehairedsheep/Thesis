Rainbow Dash says: "Calling all Pegasus ponies!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Meeting tonight!"
Flitter says: ""Mandatory meeting for all Ponyville Pegasi."
Rainbow Dash says: "Library, tonight."
Rainbow Dash says: "Be cool or be mule."
Rainbow Dash says: "No offense."
Mule says: "None taken."
Rainbow Dash says: "All right, go on in, find a seat."
Rainbow Dash says: "You too, Fluttershy."
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on, let's go."
Film announcer says: "Every living thing depends on the life-giving nourishment of rainwater, and it is up to Cloudsdale to provide rain-filled clouds to every corner of Equestria."
Film announcer says: "But how, one pony might ask, does Cloudsdale gather all this extra water?"
Film announcer says: "Tornado power!"
Film announcer says: "That's right, Pegasi-driven tornado power."
Film announcer says: "A team of Pegasi combine their wing power to create a jumbo tornado, powerful enough to pull water out of the local reservoir and funnel it all the way up to Cloudsdale."
Film announcer says: "Remember, Pegasi, your jumbo tornado must reach a minimum of eight hundred wing power to lift that water up to Cloudsdale."
Film announcer says: "So, the next time you're wondering "Where does all that extra rainwater come from?"
Spike says: "Uh..."
Spike says: "intermission?"
Rainbow Dash says: "So, here's the scoop."
Rainbow Dash says: "Cloudsdale has chosen our own highland reservoir as a source of the rainwater they need for all of Equestria."
Rainbow Dash says: "And you know what that means."
Rainbow Dash says: "It means it's up to Ponyville's Pegasi to bring that water up to Cloudsdale."
Rainbow Dash says: "Not only that, but Spitfire, captain of the Wonderbolts, will be here to oversee the water transfer and record our top tornado windspeed."
Rainbow Dash says: "Now last year, Fillydelphia broke the windspeed record with a top speed of nine hundred and ten wing power."
Rainbow Dash says: "But I think we can do better."
Rainbow Dash says: "I think we can get a top speed over a thousand!"
Rainbow Dash says: "..."
Rainbow Dash says: "if each and every pony trains, and trains hard to get their wing power numbers up."
Rainbow Dash says: "That coughing better be from a popcorn kernel, Thunderlane."
Rainbow Dash says: "Nopony's getting sick on my watch."
Rainbow Dash says: "So, are we gonna train hard?"
Pegasi says: "Yeah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Are we gonna be strong?"
Pegasi says: "Yeah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Are we gonna be fast?"
Pegasi says: "Yeah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Record-smashing fast?"
Bulk Biceps says: "YEAH!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Who's with me?"
Pegasi says: "Woo-hoo!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Fluttershy!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Stretch those glutes, Flitter!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Nice flexibility, Cloud Chaser."
Rainbow Dash says: "A..."
Rainbow Dash says: "little too much flexibility, Blossomforth."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, somepony give Blossomforth a hoof."
Rainbow Dash says: "Let's see some faster trotting, Thunderlane!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Good pace, Silverspeed!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Keep it up!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We're gonna need all the wing power we can get to break that record!"
Bulk Biceps says: "YEAH!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Good work, everypony!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Everypony except Fluttershy."
Rainbow Dash says: "Fluttershy?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I know you're in there!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You're avoiding tornado duty and I want to know why!"
Fluttershy says: "Achoo."
Fluttershy says: "Hi, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash says: "Fluttershy, what happened to you?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, you poor thing."
Rainbow Dash says: "You know, there's only one cure for pony pox."
Rainbow Dash says: "Cold water!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Those pony pox are clearing right up."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, y'know, all of a sudden, I'm, I'm starting to feel better."
Fluttershy says: "I'll just get out of these robes and– ow!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, my wing, oh, ow, it's hurt."
Rainbow Dash says: "Messed up wing, huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Stop horsing around, Fluttershy."
Rainbow Dash says: "We've got a lot of training to do."
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on now, what's going on?"
Fluttershy says: "Well, y'see, uh, well..."
Fluttershy says: "oh, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it!"
Fluttershy says: "I can't fly!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What are you talking about?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Just last week you went into that wicked nose dive to save that falling baby bird right before it hit the ground!"
Fluttershy says: "But that was different, that was an emergency!"
Fluttershy says: "This whole tornado thing, it's more like a performance, and you know how I hate performing in front of others."
Fluttershy says: "Don't you remember flight camp?"
Fluttershy says: "I couldn't gallop hard or fly fast, not with everypony looking at me!"
Rainbow Dash says: "It wasn't that bad."
Fluttershy says: "You're right, Rainbow Dash, it wasn't bad."
Fluttershy says: "It was horrible!"
Fluttershy says: "The other foals used to tease me, a lot!"
Fluttershy says: "I just can't risk that sort of humiliation again."
Rainbow Dash says: "Suck it up, Fluttershy!"
Rainbow Dash says: "This is no time for– I mean, confidence or no confidence, I'm gonna need every Pegasus to break the record, including you."
Rainbow Dash says: "I need every ounce of wing power I can get."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, I-I don't think so, Rainbow Dash..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Thanks anyway."
Fluttershy says: "Wait."
Fluttershy says: "I'll do it."
Rainbow Dash says: "You will?"
Fluttershy says: "I will."
Rainbow Dash says: "You're game?"
Fluttershy says: "I'm game."
Rainbow Dash says: "Alright!"
Cloud Chaser says: "What exactly does this machine do?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is an anemometer."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It measures your accelerative velocity and translates it into wing power, thus gauging your cumulative H2O anti-gravitational potential."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Any other questions?"
Flitter says: "Yeah."
Flitter says: "What exactly does this machine do?"
Spike says: "It tells you how fast you're flying and how strong your wings are."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Is that you again, Thunderlane?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Please, we need to have a germ-free environment."
Thunderlane says: "It wasn't me, it was Blossomforth."
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't worry, Twilight."
Rainbow Dash says: "Thunderlane's just cooking up an excuse to spend tornado day in bed."
Rainbow Dash says: "Why don't you get over here and be our first test flyer, Thunderlane?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We have 9."
Twilight Sparkle says: "3 wing power."
Pegasi says: "Wow!"
Pegasi says: "That's fast!"
Bulk Biceps says: "YEAH!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Not bad, not bad."
Twilight Sparkle says: "16."
Twilight Sparkle says: "5 wing power!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Now listen up!"
Rainbow Dash says: "If each of you can get your numbers up to at least 10."
Rainbow Dash says: "0 wing power by the end of the week, we'll no doubt set a new tornado speed record."
Rainbow Dash says: "We'll be number one!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Impressive."
Rainbow Dash says: "Fluttershy, your turn."
Foals says: "Fluttershy, Fluttershy, Fluttershy can hardly fly..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Tell her!"
Rainbow Dash says: "No, you tell her!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, you!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Um..."
Rainbow Dash says: "great job, Fluttershy!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You measured, uh, uh,."
Rainbow Dash says: "5."
Spike says: "."
Spike says: "5?"
Spike says: "Isn't that like..."
Spike says: "less than one?"
Spike says: "Ow!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Fluttershy, wait!"
Rainbow Dash says: "So some punks poked a little fun at you and you got stage fright, big deal."
Rainbow Dash says: "You aren't gonna go quit just because of that, are you?"
Fluttershy says: "Yes!"
Rainbow Dash says: "But I need you!"
Fluttershy says: "I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just  don't have the courage right now..."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, thank you, but I'm afraid a couple of little acorns won't solve my big flying problem."
Fluttershy says: "I tried, but you should've seen those ponies laughing at me..."
Fluttershy says: "I know it's important to have confidence in myself..."
Fluttershy says: "Yes, yes, I do remember."
Fluttershy says: "The river was swelling..."
Fluttershy says: "..."
Fluttershy says: "and you were scared..."
Fluttershy says: "..."
Fluttershy says: "yes, I did tell you to never give up..."
Fluttershy says: "and to believe in yourself."
Fluttershy says: "You're right, my friends."
Fluttershy says: "I shouldn't give up."
Fluttershy says: "I will get my confidence up and show everypony that I am a good flyer!"
Fluttershy says: "A great flyer!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's wonderful, Flitter."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Much better than yesterday."
Rainbow Dash says: "This is crazy awesome!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We're gonna smash that record!"
Spike says: "What did he say?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Do I look like I speak squirrel?"
Spike says: "What's that?"
Fluttershy says: "2."
Fluttershy says: "3?"
Fluttershy says: "2."
Fluttershy says: "3?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "That has to be some kind of mistake!"
Fluttershy says: "I worked so hard!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy, that's a huge improvement!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You did awesome, Fluttershy."
Fluttershy says: "No, I didn't."
Fluttershy says: "I thought I'd gotten over my nerves, but they still got the best of me!"
Fluttershy says: "There's no way I'll fly with 10."
Fluttershy says: "0 wing power tomorrow!"
Rainbow Dash says: "So you won't fly with 10."
Rainbow Dash says: "0 wing power."
Rainbow Dash says: "Every bit counts!"
Fluttershy says: "How would you feel if everypony else was flying with 10."
Fluttershy says: "0 wing power and you were flying with 2."
Fluttershy says: "5?"
Spike says: "Actually, it was only 2."
Spike says: "3, and– ow!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, uh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'd feel..."
Rainbow Dash says: "um..."
Fluttershy says: "Exactly!"
Fluttershy says: "Humiliated!"
Fluttershy says: "I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it!"
Spike says: "It's okay, Rainbow Dash, you've still got plenty of wing power for your tornado."
Spike says: "You'll be able to lift tons of water up to Cloudsdale!"
Rainbow Dash says: "If only there was a way to lift Fluttershy out of the dumps."
Rainbow Dash says: "Are we ready to do this?"
Pegasi says: "Yeah!"
Spike says: "Look!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Lazy Thunderlane!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Where is he?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "He's been trying to get out of tornado duty the whole time with his fake coughing and all."
Rainbow Dash says: "Rumble, where's your lazy brother?"
Rumble says: "He's got the feather flu."
Rumble says: "He's down at Ponyville Hospital."
Spike says: "But he's not the only one."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's see, with those eight sick Pegasi out with the feather flu..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh no!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't tell me we won't be able to break the windspeed record?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Phew!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You might not have enough wing power to create a tornado powerful enough to lift the water to Cloudsdale!"
Spike says: "Well, should we pack up?"
Rainbow Dash says: "No."
Rainbow Dash says: "Of course not."
Rainbow Dash says: "Forget the record."
Rainbow Dash says: "Cloudsdale still needs water!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay, everypony!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Let's give it all we've got!"
Rainbow Dash says: "On the sound of the horn, we take off!"
Spike says: "You think they're gonna make it to eight hundred wing power?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I sure hope so!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "One hundred and fifty wing power."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Two hundred and fifty wing power."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Five hundred wing power!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Seven hundred and fifty wing power!"
Fluttershy says: "Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are you doing here?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "I figured..."
Fluttershy says: "if I couldn't help Rainbow Dash with the tornado..."
Fluttershy says: "the least I could do was offer moral support!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "She could sure use it, considering eight Pegasi are sick with the feather flu!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh no!"
Fluttershy says: "That's terrible news!"
Pegasi says: "Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yaa– oof!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Are you okay?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm fine!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, you were so close to the eight hundred wing power minimum!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash says: "Rbbbb– We've got to try again!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But you've pushed your crew to their limit already!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "If you break apart again, somepony could get hurt!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You should quit, it's not safe!"
Rainbow Dash says: "No!"
Rainbow Dash says: "One more time!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I've gotta know we gave it our all!"
Rainbow Dash says: "If I'm going down, I'm going down flying!"
Rainbow Dash says: "C'mon, ponies, let's make this happen!"
Bulk Biceps says: "YEAH!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, here we go..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "one hundred wing power!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Two hundred!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Five hundred!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Stay in position!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Flap those wings!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Faster!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Seven hundred!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Seven hundred and fifty wing power!"
Spike says: "They fell apart right after this!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, I'm too nervous to look!"
Rainbow Dash says: "C'mon!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Just a little harder!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I can see the water trying to funnel through!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Seven ninety five!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We are so close!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy, they need you up there!"
Fluttershy says: "I won't make a difference!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You can make a difference!"
Fluttershy says: "My measly 2."
Fluttershy says: "3 wing power is still too little!"
Spike says: "It's sticking at seven ninety five!"
Spike says: "I don't know if they've got any more in 'em!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Do it for Equestria!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Do it for Rainbow Dash!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Do it for yourself!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's moving!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "She's doing it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Seven ninety eight!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "She surpassed her best wing power number!"
Fluttershy says: "No!"
"Serenity" says: "What was that?"
"Slipstream" says: "I think it was Fluttershy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "She did it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "She did it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "They all did it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa, girl, take it easy!"
Fluttershy says: "Whuh, what?"
Fluttershy says: "Did we do it?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, we did it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You did it!"
Fluttershy says: "Ah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ah!"
Flitter says: "Great job, Fluttershy, that was awesome!"
Cloud Chaser says: "Yeah, we couldn't have done it without you."
Spitfire says: "Nice job, Rainbow Dash."
Spitfire says: "You may not have set a new record, but you showed a lot of guts."
Rainbow Dash says: "Thanks, but if you wanna talk guts, then you've gotta give it to my number one flyer, Fluttershy!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Let's hear it for Fluttershy!"
Sometimes you can feel like what you have to offer is too little to make a difference, but today, I learned that everypony's contribution is important, no matter how small. If you just keep your head high, do your best, and believe in yourself, anything can happen.
Cloudsdale chugging.
