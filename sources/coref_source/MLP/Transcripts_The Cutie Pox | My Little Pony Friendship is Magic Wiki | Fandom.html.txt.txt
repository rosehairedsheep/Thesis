Apple Bloom says: "Today's the day, Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Apple Bloom says: "I can just feel it!"
Apple Bloom says: "Today's the day we are all gonna get our cutie marks in..."
Apple Bloom says: "bowlin'!"
Scootaloo says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I mean, yaay!"
Apple Bloom says: "Why, after today, we won't even be the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore!"
Apple Bloom says: "We'll be the..."
Apple Bloom says: "the Three Strikes!"
Scootaloo says: "That makes us sound like we've struck out."
Apple Bloom says: "Mmm."
Apple Bloom says: "How 'bout the Pin Twins?"
Sweetie Belle says: "But there are three of us."
Apple Bloom says: "Okay then..."
Apple Bloom says: "Um..."
Apple Bloom says: "the Bowlin' Dolls!"
Sweetie Belle says: "The Bowling Dolls!"
Sweetie Belle says: "That's it!"
Scootaloo says: "Perfect!"
Apple Bloom says: "All righty then!"
Apple Bloom says: "Let's bowl 'em over!"
Apple Bloom says: "Phpoo!"
Sea Swirl says: "Cool!"
Sea Swirl says: "A bowling cutie mark!"
Apple Bloom says: "I did it!"
Apple Bloom says: "I did it!"
Apple Bloom says: "Blank?"
Apple Bloom says: "But..."
Apple Bloom says: "but..."
Apple Bloom says: "what about my ball?"
Sweetie Belle says: "That bowling sure was fun, even if all I got was gutter balls."
Scootaloo says: "Yeah, at least you were able to keep your ball in your lane."
Scootaloo says: "I don't think Mr."
Scootaloo says: "Kingpin is ever gonna let me play again!"
Scootaloo says: "Hey, maybe I could get my cutie mark in demolition!"
Scootaloo says: "Aw, come on, Apple Bloom."
Sweetie Belle says: "I know just what you need to put the bloom back on your apple."
Sweetie Belle says: "A treat from Sugarcube Corner will cheer you up."
Apple Bloom says: "No, it won't."
Pinkie Pie says: "A party will cheer you up!"
Apple Bloom says: "No, it won't."
Rarity says: "A lovely new chapeau will cheer you up."
Apple Bloom says: "No, it won't."
Scootaloo says: "Come on, Apple Bloom, it's just a cutie mark!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Or lack of a cutie mark!"
Scootaloo says: "Shh!"
Scootaloo says: "That's not helping!"
Scootaloo says: "Apple Bloom!"
Scootaloo says: "Where are you going?!"
Scootaloo says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "Apple Bloom, come back!"
Apple Bloom says: "Whoa!"
Apple Bloom says: "Ah!"
Apple Bloom says: "Ooh!"
Apple Bloom says: "Ow!"
Apple Bloom says: "Nnnn..."
Zecora says: "Well, who is it that we have here?"
Zecora says: "Why, it's Apple Bloom, my dear!"
Apple Bloom says: "Ow..."
Zecora says: "What has happened to you, youth?"
Zecora says: "Ah, you've gone and chipped your tooth."
Zecora says: "Come with me, I have just the trick that will fix you up quite quick."
Apple Bloom says: "I've tried everything, Zecora, and still no cutie mark!"
Apple Bloom says: "Well, I'm gonna be as old as Granny Smith and still have a blank flank!"
Zecora says: "Your frustration is well understood, but one must be patient for all things good."
Apple Bloom says: "Ugh, I've heard that from every pony I know!"
Apple Bloom says: "And now from every zebra I know!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm just too impatient to be patient."
Apple Bloom says: "I just want my cutie mark and I want it now!"
Zecora says: "For your cutie mark, you will have to wait."
Zecora says: "We must fix that tooth before it's too late."
Zecora says: "Now drink down every little drop, and this mixture will mend that chip on top!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh my star apples, you did it, Zecora!"
Apple Bloom says: "Golly, you have tonics that heal all sorts of ailments."
Apple Bloom says: "Bad bones, bad back, bad breath..."
Zecora says: "Yes little one, it is true, I have many a healing brew."
Apple Bloom says: "And not only stuff that fixes the bad, but stuff that brings the good!"
Apple Bloom says: "Good health, good hair..."
Apple Bloom says: "good heavens!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hmm..."
Apple Bloom says: "I bet you can mix up a brew to fix..."
Apple Bloom says: "anything."
Zecora says: "There are many mixtures in this room, but none for what you want, dear Apple Bloom."
Zecora says: "A magic potion does not hold the key."
Zecora says: "For a cutie mark, time is the only remedy."
Apple Bloom says: "Fine."
Apple Bloom says: "Whatcha got goin' on there?"
Zecora says: "I am brewing up another mix for a rooster and his chicks."
Zecora says: "making mornings very slow."
Apple Bloom says: "Hey, I've seen that flower bloomin' in Ponyville!"
Apple Bloom says: "What is it?"
Zecora says: "It is one we call 'Heart's Desire'."
Zecora says: "A dash will ignite the rooster's fire."
Zecora says: "With Heart's Desire, his talent comes into view, and he'll give a mighty cock-a-doodle-doo!"
Apple Bloom says: "Zowie!"
Apple Bloom says: "Heart's Desire, huh?"
Zecora says: "Ay me, but what is this?"
Zecora says: "I have run out of amethyst."
Zecora says: "I must go get this purple flower for my brew to have full power!"
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah, you go, you go."
Sweetie Belle says: "I'm so hungry."
Scootaloo says: "Aah!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Aah!"
Scootaloo says: "Apple Bloom!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Apple Bloom!"
Scootaloo says: "You got your cutie mark!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You got your cutie mark!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Um, Apple Bloom..."
Sweetie Belle says: "what is it?"
Scootaloo says: "Yeah!"
Scootaloo says: "Is it an 'o'?"
Scootaloo says: "Is your talent spelling?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Or is it a ring?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Are you a jewelry maker?"
Twist says: "Or is it a powdered donut?"
Twist says: "'Cause that sounds delicious."
Apple Bloom says: "No, it's a loop-de-hoop!"
Scootaloo says: "A what now?"
Apple Bloom says: "A loop-de-hoop!"
Apple Bloom says: "'Least, that's what I always called it."
Apple Bloom says: "Applejack made it for me from an old rain barrel when I was littler!"
Apple Bloom says: "Who woulda thought that loop-de-hoop would end up bein' my special talent?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Wow, Apple Bloom, that's amazing!"
Diamond Tiara says: "That's it?"
Diamond Tiara says: "That's your talent?"
Silver Spoon says: "Spinning a hoop around your waist?"
Silver Spoon says: "Puh-lease."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, you ain't seen nothin' yet."
Scootaloo says: "Apple Bloom, you're super-duper-loop-de-hooper!"
Apple Bloom says: "Thanks, everypony!"
Cheerilee says: "All right, my little ponies, time for class!"
Cheerilee says: "Apple Bloom?"
Apple Bloom says: "Yes, Miss Cheerilee?"
Cheerilee says: "I want you to take your loop-de-hoop into the yard..."
Cheerilee says: "and give us all a lesson in your amazing loop-de-hooping!"
Apple Bloom says: "Don't worry, gals."
Apple Bloom says: "Keep at it and you might get to be half as good as me!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Grr..."
Silver Spoon says: "Grr..."
Apple Bloom says: "Great job, girls!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You're too kind, Apple Bloom."
Scootaloo says: "Yeah, we stink."
Apple Bloom says: "Nah, you just need a little practice."
Apple Bloom says: "Soon you'll be able to..."
Apple Bloom says: "hoop and bop!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hoop and hop!"
Apple Bloom says: "And hoop and flip!"
Cheerilee says: "Show us some more, Apple Bloom."
Apple Bloom says: "Well, all right, just a few more tricks."
Apple Bloom says: "But be warned!"
Apple Bloom says: "These are advanced moves, not for beginners."
Apple Bloom says: "Got that, Diamond Tiara?"
Apple Bloom says: "I call this one the hoop-la!"
Apple Bloom says: "Huh?"
Apple Bloom says: "Oof!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Another cutie mark?"
Diamond Tiara says: "Hah!"
Diamond Tiara says: "I guess that last trick was a lot of hoopla."
Diamond Tiara says: "Those cutie marks are fake!"
Apple Bloom says: "What?"
Apple Bloom says: "No they're not!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Miss Cheerilee, have you ever heard of a pony with two cutie marks?"
Cheerilee says: "I must say that I never have, but maybe Apple Bloom has two special talents!"
Silver Spoon says: "Oh yeah?"
Silver Spoon says: "Then let's see you do that!"
Snips says: "Spin plates!"
Snails says: "Yeah!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Two cutie marks?"
Scootaloo says: "Two talents?"
Apple Bloom says: "Aw yeah!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Our friend is the most..."
Scootaloo says: "..."
Sweetie Belle says: "..."
Scootaloo says: "special pony ever!"
Sweetie Belle says: "special pony ever!"
Apple Bloom says: "Alright, everypony, You ready for a real show?"
Applejack says: "Yee-haw, little sis!"
Applejack says: "Congratulations on gettin' not just one, but two cutie marks!"
Applejack says: "We're mighty proud of you, right, Big McIntosh?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Applejack says: "I've never seen anythin' like it."
Applejack says: "Have you, Big Mac?"
Big McIntosh says: "Nnnope."
Granny Smith says: "Why, the way you were a-hoopin' and a-hoppin' and kickin' and spinnin' reminded me of when I was a spry young filly."
Granny Smith says: "Guh, charley horse, charley horse!"
Granny Smith says: "Ooh, that's better."
Applejack says: "Why, Apple Bloom, I think you're ready to hit the rodeo circuit right now!"
Apple Bloom says: "Actually, I'm ready to hit the hay right now."
Apple Bloom says: "I'm plum tuckered."
Apple Bloom says: "I'll see y'all in the mornin'."
Apple Bloom says: "Night!"
Applejack says: "Night!"
Applejack says: "Oh my, little Apple Bloom has finally blossomed, hasn't she, Big Mac?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup!"
Applejack says: "Three cutie marks?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "Help me!"
Apple Bloom says: "Help me!"
Applejack says: "C'mere, you!"
Applejack says: "Ow!"
Applejack says: "Ow!"
Applejack says: "Whoa!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm sorry, Applejack!"
Apple Bloom says: "I dunno how to make it stop!"
Applejack says: "Well, I know somepony who might!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Three cutie marks."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Three talents."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've never seen anything like it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I was just reading something about unusual equine illnesses."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What was it?"
Spike says: ""Perplexing Pony Plagues", perhaps?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes, Spike, you're amazing!"
Spike says: "Yes, well, I do have some talents."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hay fever..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "the trots..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Cutie pox!"
Apple Bloom says: "Cutie pox?!"
Applejack says: "Cutie pox?!"
Spike says: "Cutie pox?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Applejack says: "!"
Spike says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Cutie pox."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This puzzling pony plague afflicted a population of ponies back in the Paleopony Period!"
Spike says: "Heh, say that ten times fast!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Random cutie marks appeared all over the ponies' bodies, causing them to perform all the talents that came with them!"
Apple Bloom says: "Just like me!"
Applejack says: "Yes, but what's the cure?"
Applejack says: "What's the cure?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It says here there's no known cure!"
Apple Bloom says: "No known cure?!"
Applejack says: "No known cure?!"
Spike says: "No known cure?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Applejack says: "!"
Spike says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The cause of the breakout was never discovered, and the cutie pox disappears as mysteriously as they arrived!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, no!"
Apple Bloom says: "Sacré bleu!"
Apple Bloom says: "Plus de marques de cutie!"
Apple Bloom says: "Qu'est-ce c'est?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "Je parle Français?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Applejack says: "My sister's speakin' in fancy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "She needs help!"
Applejack says: "I know she needs help!"
Applejack says: "We can't just wait for this to go away!"
Applejack says: "We gotta find somepony to mix up a cure!"
Applejack says: "And fast!"
Apple Bloom says: "Tout de suite!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not some pony..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "some zebra!"
Applejack says: "Zecora!"
Applejack says: "Hurry, hurry!"
Apple Bloom says: "Dépêchez-vous!"
Lily Valley says: "She's cursed!"
Rose says: "Hexed!"
Daisy says: "Enchanted!"
Spike says: "No, she's not."
Spike says: "She just has some weird mysterious disease with no known cure called cutie pox."
Everypony says: "Cutie pox?!"
Everypony says: "!"
Pony says: "She's got the cutie pox!"
Zecora says: "I thought I had removed their fear the last time that I visited here."
Zecora says: "But doors are barred and shutters shut."
Zecora says: "Guess I should've stayed inside my hut."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Zecora!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Apple Bloom has cutie pox!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We were just on our way to see if you had a cure!"
Applejack says: "But magically you're here!"
Applejack says: "Was your zebra sense a-tinglin'?"
Zecora says: "My 'zebra sense' did not bring me round, it was a special flower that I needed found."
Zecora says: "I thought I picked enough to fix all the potions I had to mix, but after my visit from Apple Bloom, some had mysteriously left my room."
Zecora says: "Apple Bloom!"
Zecora says: "What do you say?"
Zecora says: "Did this flower just walk away?"
Apple Bloom says: "I, um..."
Zecora says: "A cutie pox cure I have forsooth, for healing power is in the Seeds of Truth."
Applejack says: "Well, well then give 'em to her!"
Applejack says: "Quick!"
Zecora says: "These seeds must be planted in the ground."
Zecora says: "With the truth, they'll grow, and the cure is found."
Applejack says: "Come again?"
Zecora says: "The Seeds of Truth do hold the cure, but one must speak words, true and pure."
Applejack says: "Well then let's get to it!"
Applejack says: "Alright, they're planted, now somepony tell the truth!"
Apple Bloom says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Applejack says: "Somepony!"
Applejack says: "Anypony!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yesterday I told Mrs."
Pinkie Pie says: "Cake that I ate two corn cakes, but I really ate three!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay, six!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I ate six corn cakes!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Make it stop!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, make it stop!"
Apple Bloom says: "Wah, I can't stand it any more!"
Apple Bloom says: "It's me!"
Apple Bloom says: "I admit it!"
Apple Bloom says: "I didn't earn my cutie mark!"
Apple Bloom says: "They're all fake!"
Apple Bloom says: "I figured the Heart's Desire would help me get what I wanted most!"
Apple Bloom says: "So when Zecora left her hut, I mixed up a special potion and put the rest of the Heart's Desire in it!"
Apple Bloom says: "Ahh."
Sweetie Belle says: "Apple Bloom!"
Scootaloo says: "Are you okay?"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm great, and I've never been happier to be a blank flank."
Apple Bloom says: "But I'm awful sorry I lied, 'specially to you gals."
Apple Bloom says: "I was so desperate for my cutie mark, I just got carried away."
Apple Bloom says: "And I'm really sorry I snuck those flowers from you, Zecora."
Apple Bloom says: "Why, I wouldn't blame you if you never wanted me to come by again."
Zecora says: "Now, Apple Bloom, do not be silly."
Zecora says: "You are always welcome, my little filly."
Zecora says: "With each mistake you learn something new, growing up into a better you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Apple Bloom, would you mind writing to Princess Celestia and telling her what you've learned?"
Apple Bloom says: "I'd be happy to, Twilight!"
Apple Bloom says: "Spike?"
Spike says: "Ready!"
Waiting for what your heart desires can be really hard. So, you may try to take a shortcut. But this dishonesty never works, because you didn't earn what your heart desired. The only cure is being honest with yourself and others. And that's something every heart desires.
Applejack says: "I sure am proud of you, sis."
Applejack says: "Seems like you finally learned the importance of patience."
Apple Bloom says: "Yup!"
Apple Bloom says: "All good things come to those who wait."
Apple Bloom says: "Well!"
Apple Bloom says: "I've waited long enough."
Scootaloo says: "Actually, that was way too long."
Applejack says: "What?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "So what are we gonna do today to earn our cutie marks?"
Scootaloo says: "Well, I was thinking, for a pony who's never mixed up a potion before, you sure stirred up something fierce."
Sweetie Belle says: "Yeah!"
Sweetie Belle says: "So what if your talent is potion making?"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh my gosh, totally!"
Apple Bloom says: "Let's go talk to Zecora, now!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Yeah!"
Scootaloo says: "Woo-hoo!"
