Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hi, Pinkie Pie..."
Pinkie Pie.
This is your singing telegram.
I hope it finds you well.
You're invited to a party.
Gummy's turning one year old.
So help us celebrate.
The cake will be delicious.
The festivities first-rate.
There will be games and dancing.
Bob for apples, cut a rug pop.
And when the party's over.
We'll gather 'round for a group hug.
Slowing down.
No need to bring a gift.
Being there will be enough.
Birthdays mean having fun with friends.
Not getting lots of stuff.
Breathing heavily.
It won't be the same without you.
So we hope that you say yes.
So, please, oh please R.S.V.P.
And come, and be our guest!
Pinkie Pie says: "Next time, I think I'll just pass out written invitations."
Rainbow Dash says: "Nice one!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Now, let me show you how it's really done."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, girls!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, Pinkie Pie!"
Applejack says: "Howdy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Just wanted to tell you how happy I am that you could make it to Gummy's party."
Applejack says: "Are you kiddin'?"
Applejack says: "I wouldn't have missed it for the world."
Rainbow Dash says: "Me neither."
Rainbow Dash says: "When Pinkie Pie throws a party, I am there!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ta-da!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Aw!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's just a boring old apple."
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't worry, there are plenty of other surprises in there."
Rainbow Dash says: "What kind of surprises?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I can't tell you that, silly."
Pinkie Pie says: "Then it wouldn't be a surprise."
Rarity says: "This punch is simply divine."
Rarity says: "Is this the same recipe you used for your "Spring Has Sprung" party?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Nope!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Something new."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's Gummy's favorite."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh, this is my jam!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Having fun?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "A blast!"
Fluttershy says: "You always throw the best parties, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie says: "They're always the best parties 'cause my best friends are always there!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "C'mon, everypony!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Gummy wants to dance!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Go, Gummy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's your birthday!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Go, Gummy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's your birthday!"
Applejack says: "Hoo-wee!"
Applejack says: "I am beat!"
Applejack says: "I haven't danced that much since..."
Applejack says: "Well, since your last party."
Applejack says: "Thanks again for the invite!"
Rainbow Dash says: "See ya later, birthday alligator!"
Rarity says: "Bravo for hosting yet another delightful soiree."
Fluttershy says: "It's been lovely."
Pinkie Pie says: "You sure you don't wanna stay?"
Pinkie Pie says: "There's still some cake left."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh, I think I'm gonna pass."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Great party though."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We should do this again soon."
Pinkie Pie says: "We should do this again soon!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's soon!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pardon me?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You said we should have another party soon, and..."
Pinkie Pie says: "it's soon!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Here's your invitation!"
Twilight Sparkle says: ""You're invited to Gummy's 'after-birthday' party."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This afternoon at 3 o'clock."
Pinkie Pie says: "All our bestest friends are invited, and there's gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This afternoon?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "As in, "this afternoon" this afternoon?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yes, indeedy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, gosh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I wish I could make it, but I've gotten a bit behind in my studies."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've really gotta hit the books."
Pinkie Pie says: "I understand."
Pinkie Pie says: "Your studies come first."
Pinkie Pie says: "But don't worry, we'll be sure to save you some cake."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Please do."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And Twilight, you shouldn't hit the books."
Pinkie Pie says: "You should really just read them."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll keep that in mind."
Applejack says: "Huh?"
Applejack says: "Oh, hi, Pinkie Pie!"
Applejack says: "What brings you 'round these parts?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Who's ready to shake their hoof-thang?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's an invitation to Gummy's "after-birthday" party this afternoon."
Pinkie Pie says: "There's gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!"
Applejack says: "This afternoon?"
Applejack says: "A-as in, "this afternoon" this afternoon?"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's funny."
Pinkie Pie says: "That's just what Twilight said, and the answer is, "Yes!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's this afternoon!"
Applejack says: "Uh, well, I..."
Applejack says: "I..."
Applejack says: "uh..."
Applejack says: "I don't think I can make it 'cause..."
Applejack says: "uh..."
Applejack says: "I have to..."
Applejack says: "uh..."
Applejack says: "uh, you know what?"
Applejack says: "I..."
Applejack says: "uh..."
Applejack says: "pick apples!"
Applejack says: "Yep, apples!"
Applejack says: "'Cause that's what we do!"
Applejack says: "With the..."
Applejack says: "apples."
Applejack says: "We, uh..."
Applejack says: "pick 'em!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Okey-dokey-lokey!"
Pinkie Pie says: "A party is still a party, even if there are only three guests."
Spike says: "Anything else I can do for you, most beautiful one?"
Rarity says: "Hmm..."
Rarity says: "perhaps you could take a bath."
Rarity says: "How do I put this delicately?"
Rarity says: "You smell like a rotten apple core that's been wrapped in moldy hay and dipped in dragon perspiration."
Rarity says: "Ooh!"
Rarity says: "Love the new hat."
Rarity says: "Very modern."
Rarity says: "What's the occasion?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Gummy's "after-birthday" party is this afternoon."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm delivering the invitations."
Rarity says: "The party is this afternoon?"
Rarity says: "As in, "this afternoon" this afternoon?"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's so strange."
Pinkie Pie says: "Everypony keeps saying that."
Rarity says: "Oh..."
Rarity says: "do they?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I know it's short notice, but we had such a great time at his birthday party, I thought we could have even more fun at his after-birthday party."
Rarity says: "And I'm sure that we would, but I'm going to have to decline."
Rarity says: "I have to..."
Rarity says: "wash my hair!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't be silly, your hair doesn't look dirty."
Rarity says: "It doesn't?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Nope!"
Rarity says: "See?"
Rarity says: "Dirty!"
Rarity says: "I have to go!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Huh..."
Pinkie Pie says: "No Twilight, no Applejack, no Rarity."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh well, a party is still a party even with only two guests."
Rainbow Dash says: "This afternoon?"
Fluttershy says: "As in..."
Fluttershy says: "?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yes!"
Pinkie Pie says: "As in, "this afternoon" this afternoon!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, man!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We'd love to, but..."
Rainbow Dash says: "we're..."
Rainbow Dash says: "house-sitting this afternoon."
Pinkie Pie says: "Both of you?"
Fluttershy says: "It's..."
Fluttershy says: "uh..."
Fluttershy says: "a big house."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, look at the time!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We'd really better get going."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Maybe I could bring you some after-birthday cake and ice-cream."
Pinkie Pie says: "Who're you house-sitting for?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Harry."
Pinkie Pie says: "Harry?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, I don't think you know him."
Pinkie Pie says: "That's strange."
Pinkie Pie says: "I know just about everypony around here."
Fluttershy says: "He's..."
Fluttershy says: "a bear."
Pinkie Pie says: "A bear?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yup!"
Rainbow Dash says: "He's a bear all right, and he'll be pretty upset if we don't get over to his house soon."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait!"
Pinkie Pie says: "There's a bear around here who lives in a house?"
Fluttershy says: "It's, uh, really more of a cave."
Rainbow Dash says: "But he's fixed up the place so much, it feels like a house."
Fluttershy says: "And, uh, he wants us to look after his house..."
Fluttershy says: "uh, cave..."
Fluttershy says: "while he's, uh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "A-at the beach!"
Pinkie Pie says: "He's vacationing at the beach?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yup!"
Rainbow Dash says: "He loves to..."
Collect sea shells!
Play beach volleyball!
Rainbow Dash says: "Gotta go!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Something strange is definitely going on around here, Gummy."
Pinkie Pie says: "Sure Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to house-sit for that vacationing bear, but what are the chances all my other friends would have plans this afternoon too?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Rarity has to wash her hair?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Applejack has to pick apples?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Twilight is behind on her studies and has to hit the books?"
Pinkie Pie says: "The more I think about it, the more those are starting to sound like..."
Pinkie Pie says: "excuses!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That doesn't look like studying..."
Pinkie Pie says: "or hitting!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Ooh!"
Mrs. Cake says: "You must be here for..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Shh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Is Pinkie Pie around?"
Mrs. Cake says: "Oh, I don't think so."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Good."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't wanna her to know anything about this."
Mrs. Cake says: "Yes, of course."
Mrs. Cake says: "I'll be right back."
Pinkie Pie says: "But..."
Pinkie Pie says: "we're friends."
Pinkie Pie says: "What wouldn't Twilight want me to know anything about?"
Pinkie Pie says: "She's coming back."
Mrs. Cake says: "There you go!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Time to get to the bottom of things!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I think our cover's been blown!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We'll need a new disguise."
Rarity says: "She didn't see you at the sweet shop, did she?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't think so."
Rarity says: "Oh, good."
Rarity says: "I'd hate for her to ruin everything."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Me too."
Rarity says: "Have you seen her?"
Fluttershy says: "Not since this morning."
Rarity says: "Me neither."
Rarity says: "Can you believe she was planning on throwing an after-birthday party today?"
Fluttershy says: "I'm just glad I was able to come up with an excuse for why I couldn't be there."
Rarity says: "Me too!"
Rarity says: "This is obviously going to be so much better."
Fluttershy says: "As long as we keep her from finding out about it, it will."
Rarity says: "See you later!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I thought everypony loved my parties."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hi, Pinkie Pie!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh-oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Phew..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Where're you going?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What's the real reason you didn't want to come to Gummy's party?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What's in the bags?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Applejack!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We have a problem!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I know you're IN THERE!"
Applejack says: "Oh!"
Applejack says: "Howdy, pardner!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Mind if I..."
Pinkie Pie says: "take a look inside the barn?"
Applejack says: "No!"
Applejack says: "Uh, I mean, yes, I mean..."
Applejack says: "you can't come in here!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Rainbow Dash just went in there."
Applejack says: "Oh, well, she was just bringin' in some..."
Applejack says: "supplies!"
Applejack says: "Yup, supplies for the..."
Applejack says: "renovation!"
Applejack says: "Fixin' up the whole thing, top to bottom..."
Applejack says: "uh, lots of construction goin' on in there right now."
Rainbow Dash says: "You heard her!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Construction!"
Applejack says: "Yup!"
Applejack says: "Construction!"
Applejack says: "That's my story, and I'm stickin' to it."
Pinkie Pie says: "Okey..."
Pinkie Pie says: "dokey..."
Pinkie Pie says: "lokey."
Pinkie Pie says: "Secrets and lies!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's all secrets and lies with those ponies!"
Pinkie Pie says: "They're up to something, Gummy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Something they don't want me to know about!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, I'm gonna know about it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm gonna know about it big time!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And I know just who's gonna tell me all about it."
Pinkie Pie says: "Tell me all about it big time!"
Spike says: "Wow!"
Spike says: "Nice spread!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's all yours, Spike."
Pinkie Pie says: "All you have to do is talk."
Spike says: "That's it?"
Spike says: "Oh, you got it."
Spike says: "Okay..."
Spike says: "uh, beautiful weather we're having, eh?"
Spike says: "I love a sunny spring day, don't you?"
Spike says: "The birds chirpin' and the flowers bloomin'."
Pinkie Pie says: "No, no, no."
Pinkie Pie says: "Talk about our friends."
Spike says: "Oh, okay."
Spike says: "Let's see, there's Twilight Sparkle."
Spike says: "She's a unicorn."
Spike says: "Good with magic."
Spike says: "A real brainiac."
Spike says: "And then you got Rarity."
Spike says: "Total knockout."
Spike says: "Twilight seems to think I don't even have a chance with her, but..."
Spike says: "eh, what does she know?"
Spike says: "Let's see."
Spike says: "There's..."
Spike says: "there's Fluttershy, a Pegasus who's afraid of heights."
Spike says: "Heh, what's up with that?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Grr!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You're not understanding me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I want you to confess!"
Spike says: "Confess?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Confess!"
Spike says: "I'm the one who spilled juice all over Twilight's copy of "Magical Mysteries and Practical Potions"!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And?"
Spike says: "And I'm the one who used up all the hot water in Ponyville yesterday when I took a seven-hour bubble bath!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Aaand?"
Spike says: "And sometimes..."
Spike says: "when no one's around..."
Spike says: "I do this: Lookin' good, Spike!"
Spike says: "Lookin' real good!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No!"
Spike says: "W-What do you wanna hear?"
Spike says: "Tell me what you want me to say, and I'll say it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Tell me that my friends are all lying to me and avoiding me because they don't like my parties and they don't want to be my friends anymore!"
Spike says: "Your friends are all lying to you and avoiding you 'cause they don't like your parties and they don't want to be your friends anymore!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Aha!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I knew it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh no, my friends don't like my parties and they don't want to be my friends anymore."
Spike says: "Uh..."
Spike says: "so..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Thank you all so much for coming!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It means so much to Gummy."
Pinkie Pie voicing a bucket of turnips says: "Could I have some more punch?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, of course you can have some more punch, Mr."
Pinkie Pie says: "Turnip."
Pinkie Pie voicing a pile of rocks says: "This is one great pahty!"

Pinkie Pie says: "Well, it was pretty rude..."
Madame le Flour says: "Pretty rude?"
Madame le Flour says: "It was downright deespicable!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It was, wasn't it?"
Mr. Turnip says: "If I were you, I wouldn't speak to them ever again."
Pinkie Pie says: "You know what?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm not gonna speak to them ever again."
Pinkie Pie says: "And I'm not gonna invite them to another party as long as I live!"
Pinkie Pie says: "They don't deserve to be invited to my parties."
Pinkie Pie says: "Not after the way they've been acting."
Madame le Flour says: "Deeespicable!"
Sir Lintsalot says: "Such losers!"
Madame le Flour says: "Yes, zat's right."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well done."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah!"

Rainbow Dash says: "" You know how it goes."
Pinkie Pie says: "I know how it goes, all right!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah..."
Rainbow Dash says: "so, why don't you come with me over to Sweet Apple Acres?"
Pinkie Pie says: "No thanks."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm spending time with my real friends."
Pinkie Pie says: "Isn't that right, Madame le Flour?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oui!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Zat iz correct, madame."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie Pie?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Another slice of cake, Sir Lintsalot?"

Rainbow Dash says: "What do you say we get on out of Creepytown and head over to Applejack's..."
Pinkie Pie says: "She's not going anywhere."
Pinkie Pie says: "I most certainly am not."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm having a wonderful time right here."
Rainbow Dash says: "You should really just come with me."
Pinkie Pie says: "You heard the lady!"
Pinkie Pie says: "She ain't goin' nowheres, chump!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Who you calling a chump, chump?!"

Rainbow Dash says: "here..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Surprise!"
Applejack says: "Surprise!"
Rarity says: "Surprise!"
Fluttershy says: "Surprise!"
Fluttershy says: "I really thought she'd be more excited."
Pinkie Pie says: "Excited?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Excited?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Why would I be excited to attend my own farewell party?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Farewell party?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yes!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You don't like me anymore, so you decided to kick me out of the group and throw a great, big party to celebrate!"
Pinkie Pie says: "A "Farewell to Pinkie Pie" party!"
Applejack says: "Why in the world would you think we didn't like you anymore, sugarcube?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Why?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Why?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Why?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Because you've been lying to me and avoiding me all day, that's why!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, yeah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Because we wanted your party to be a surprise."
Rarity says: "We'd been planning this party for such a long time, we had to make excuses for why we couldn't attend Gummy's party so that we could get everything ready for yours."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If this is a farewell party, why does the cake I picked up from Sugarcube Corner say "Happy Birthday, Pinkie Pie"?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Because it's my birthday!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh, how could I have forgotten my own birthday?"
Pinkie Pie says: "And you like me so much you decided to throw me a surprise party!"
Rarity says: "That's what we've been trying to tell you, darling."
Pinkie Pie says: "You girls are the best friends ever!"
Pinkie Pie says: "How could I have ever doubted you?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's okay, Pinkie Pie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It could have happened to any of us."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh-huh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "It sure would."
Fluttershy says: "Don't worry about it."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm just glad I haven't been replaced by a bucket of turnips."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "You don't wanna know."
Applejack says: "All right, girls!"
Applejack says: "Enough of this gab."
Applejack says: "Let's party!"
I am writing to you from the most delightful party. I'm not only having a great time with my friends, but also was given the opportunity to learn a valuable lesson about friendship. Always expect the best from your friends, and never assume the worst. Rest assured that a good friend always has your best interests at heart.
Your faithful student,.
Twilight Sparkle.
Pinkie Pie says: "You girls wouldn't mind if we celebrated Gummy's after-birthday party too, would you?"
Pinkie Pie says: "His party was cut short, and he's pretty upset about it."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, definitely."
Rarity says: "Aww, he was upset?"
Applejack says: "Uh-huh, sure!"
Rainbow Dash says: "For Gummy, yeah!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yeah, why not?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's have a party for Gummy."
