Twilight Sparkle says: "Quill."
Spike says: "Check."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Parchment."
Spike says: "Check."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Extra ink."
Spike says: "Check."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Extra extra ink."
Spike says: "Check."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Is that everything on the checklist?"
Spike says: "Yep."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Great."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now that we've completed the checklist of things we need to create a checklist, we can make my checklist of the things I have to get done by the end of the day."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ready?"
Spike says: "Ready!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Item one: create checklist of the things I have to accomplish by the end of the day."
Twilight Sparkle says: "How are we doing, Spike?"
Spike says: "Let's see..."
Spike says: "We've already dropped off your cape at the cleaners, returned the blackboard you borrowed from Cheerilee, ordered new parchment and quills from the stationery shop..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hmm..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Seems like we just placed an order for those a few days ago."
Spike says: "Can't imagine why we go through so many of them."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sounds like we're ahead of schedule."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's next?"
Spike says: "Cupcakes!"
Spike says: "Whoa..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh, I only ordered twelve."
Mrs Cake says: "Oh, I know, dear, but I had an extra."
Mrs Cake says: "So I thought I'd make it a baker's dozen."
Spike says: "Uhhh-no!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, that was very thoughtful of you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's just some of the icing from the extra cupcake is getting all over the one next to it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "See?"
Mrs Cake says: "Ohh..."
Mrs Cake says: "sure..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's just that I'm planning on sharing these at a picnic later and I don't want anypony to feel like somepony else is getting more icing."
Mrs Cake says: "Oh, no..."
Mrs Cake says: "of course not."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not to worry, I'll just move some of this one to..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "hmm..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I think I may have scooped too much..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "oops!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now those two have more."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's just try this again..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hmm, no, that won't do."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let me just..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "hmm..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "put some here, and..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "no, that's not right."
Twilight Sparkle says: "A little more on this one, a little bit..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "and wait..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll just..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "ooh, a little bit here, and here, and..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "perfect!"
Mrs Cake says: "Hmm, oh yes..."
Mrs Cake says: "much better..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, time to tackle the next item on our—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "oops!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Looks like we're going to have to add 'give a baby dragon a bath' to our list."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Very efficient!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And a little bit gross."
Spike says: "Eh."
Spike says: "Looks like that's everything!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Almost everything."
Spike says: ""Triple-check checklist to make sure we didn't miss anything when we double checked the checklist!"
Spike says: "" Uh..."
Spike says: "check!"
Spike says: "Ugh..."
Spike says: "I've been holding that quill so long, I've got a claw cramp!"
Spike says: "Well, good thing we don't have anything to report to Princess Celestia this week..."
Spike says: "I don't think I could write another word!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We haven't sent a letter to Princess Celestia this week?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Spike says: "Why?"
Spike says: "Is that bad?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Bad?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "BAD?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Of course it's bad!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm supposed to send Princess Celestia a letter every week, telling her about a lesson I've learned about friendship!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not every other week, not every ten days, every..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "single..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "week!"
Spike says: "Huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ohh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where's my calendar, where's my calendar?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Spike says: "Where it.."
Spike says: "always is?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "When did we send the last one?"
Spike says: "Last..."
Spike says: "Tuesday?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And today is..."
Spike says: "Tuesday?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Argh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nononononononono!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "If I don't send her a letter by sundown, I'll be..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "tardy!"
Spike says: "What's that now?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Tar-dy, Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Late, I'll be late!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, how could I let this happen?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm usually so organized."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've never been late with an assignment."
Spike says: "Oh, please!"
Spike says: "You're the most studious student ever!"
Spike says: "I'm sure the Princess will forgive you if you miss one little deadline."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm afraid to take that chance, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is the ruler of all of Equestria we're talking about."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The pony who holds my fate in her hooves!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What if she doesn't forgive me?"
Spike says: "Yeah..."
Spike says: "I don't think she—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What if instead she starts thinking I'm not taking my studies on friendship seriously?"
Spike says: "Why would she—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What if she makes me come back to Canterlot and puts me back in school and makes me prove I've been taking them seriously by giving me a test?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What if I don't pass?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Spike says: "Well, why wouldn't you pass—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "She's my teacher."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Do you know what teachers do to students who don't pass?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "They send them back a grade!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But she won't just send me back a grade."
Twilight Sparkle says: "She'll send me back to..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "magic kindergarten."
Spike says: "Twilight?"
Spike says: "Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Huh?"
Spike says: "That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard!"
Spike says: "You're not going to be sent back to magic kindergarten."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're right."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I have no reason to worry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Because I'm going to solve a friend's problem and get that letter to Princess Celestia before sundown!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "So..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "got any problems, troubles, conundrums, or any other sort of issues, major or minor, that I as a good friend could help you solve?"
Spike says: "Huh."
Spike says: "Hmm."
Spike says: "Huunh."
Spike says: "Huh..."
Spike says: "I got nothin'."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Then it looks like I'm going to have to find somepony who does."
Spike says: "This won't end well."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You've got this, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You still have plenty of time to get that letter to Princess Celestia!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Has to be somepony who needs the help of a good friend!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rarity!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Don't worry, Rarity!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm here!"
Rarity says: "WHYYYY?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "Why?"
Rarity says: "Why-y?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "And of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE."
Rarity says: "WORST."
Rarity says: "POSSIBLE."
Rarity says: "THING!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's happened?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Are you alright?"
Rarity says: "I've lost my diamond-encrusted purple ribbon!"
Rarity says: "I have searched high, and I have searched low."
Rarity says: "Low and high!"
Rarity says: "High and low!"
Rarity says: "But I can't find it anywhere!"
Rarity says: "Anywhe-e-e-e-ere!"
Rarity says: "How can I possibly finish my latest creation if I can't find it?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Never fear, Rarity."
Twilight Sparkle says: "As your friend I'll do my best to help you fi—"
Rarity says: "Oh, there it is."
Rarity says: "Isn't it always just the last place you look?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "So..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "you just lost your ribbon?"
Rarity says: "Mm-hm!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But now you've found it?"
Rarity says: "Yuh-huh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And nothing else is bothering you?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nothing that I, as a good friend, could help you with?"
Rarity says: "Hmm..."
Rarity says: "there is one thing."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes?"
Rarity says: "I think I left my measuring tape under the fabric over there."
Rarity says: "Could you get that for me?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Measuring tape?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sure."
Rarity says: "Twilight?"
Rarity says: "Is there something bother—"
Rarity says: "Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No need to panic."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rarity is just one pony."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm sure one of my other friends will need me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What in the world..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow must be angry with Applejack!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "She must hate her guts!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "How wonderful!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Stop!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Listen, Rainbow."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know you're upset with Applejack, but don't worry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Whatever it is that has come between you two, I'm sure that I, as a good friend, can help you resolve your problems."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, what are you talking about?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to hide your feelings from me!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can tell you two must've had a terrible fight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now, why don't you tell me all about your issues with Applejack."
Rainbow Dash says: "I don't have any issues with Applejack."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You don't?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Then why are you destroying her property?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Because she asked me to."
Rainbow Dash says: "Right, Applejack?"
Applejack says: "Yes, ma'am."
Applejack says: "I wanted to put up a new barn, but this one's gotta come down first."
Applejack says: "Hehe."
Applejack says: "Now get back to it, R."
Applejack says: "D."
Rainbow Dash says: "You got it, boss!"
Applejack says: "I'd take cover if I were you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can't believe I wasted all that time."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I should have just come here first."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy always has some fear she's trying to get over."
Twilight Sparkle says: "As a good friend, I'll be able to help her."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "How can this be happening?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Of all the days she had to stop being such a scaredy-pony, she had to pick today?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What am I going to do?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "You really should have come to me sooner."
Fluttershy says: "You were carrying so much tension in that shoulder."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's fine."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It'll all be fine."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The day isn't over yet."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But it will be over soon!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It'll be all over!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "My time in Ponyville!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "My advanced studies!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nono."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're a good student."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You can do this."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ooh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But what if I can't?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You can!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You just have to keep it together."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Keep."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Together!"
Spike says: "Are you talking to..."
Spike says: "yourself?"
Spike says: "Twilight?"
Spike says: "Snap out of it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Huh?"
Spike says: "Are you okay?"
Spike says: "Twilight, I'm really worried."
Spike says: "I mean this letter thing is really getting to you."
Spike says: "Here."
Spike says: "You've been so anxious all day that you completely forgot about the picnic."
Spike says: "Why don't you just relax and go hang out with—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The picnic!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I should go see my friends!"
Spike says: "I'm glad you've come to your senses."
Rarity says: "Please tell me I did not forget the plates."
Rarity says: "Why, why, why..."
Rarity says: "Uh..."
Rarity says: "What?"
Rarity says: "You didn't expect me to lay on the grass, did you?"
Applejack says: "You alright, hun?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I am not alright."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's just terrible."
Applejack says: "Yes?"
Fluttershy says: "Yes?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yes?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yes?"
Rarity says: "Yes?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Simply awful."
Applejack says: "Yes?!"
Fluttershy says: "Yes?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yes?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yes?!"
Rarity says: "Yes?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rarity says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's the most horrific trouble I've ever been in and I really really really need your help!"
Applejack says: "YES?!"
Fluttershy says: "YES?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "YES?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "YES?!"
Rarity says: "YES?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rarity says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "My letter to Princess Celestia is almost overdue, and I haven't learned anything about friendship!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, thank goodness."
Fluttershy says: "I thought something really awful had happened."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Something awful has happened!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "If I don't turn in the letter on time, I'll be tardy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "TARDY!"
Applejack says: "No offense, sugarcube, but it looks like somepony's gettin' themselves all worked up over nothin'."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is not nothing."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is everything."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I need you guys to help me find somepony with a problem I can fix before sundown!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "My whole life depends on it!"
Applejack says: "Come on now."
Applejack says: "Have a seat and stop sweatin' the small stuff."
Fluttershy says: "Wow."
Fluttershy says: "I've never seen Twilight so upset before."
Rarity says: "Oh, what a drama queen."
Rarity says: "Mm."
Rarity says: "Relatively speaking..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Clock is ticking, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Clock."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Is."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ticking."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Keep it together."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If I can't find a friendship problem..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll make a friendship problem!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hi, girls!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, hi, Twilight."
Apple Bloom says: "How's it go—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Gr-eat."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Just great."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You three look like you're doing great too!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Looks like three good friends who obviously don't need the help of another good friend."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is Smarty Pants."
Twilight Sparkle says: "She was mine when I was your age, and now I want to give her to you!"
Scootaloo says: "Uhh..."
Scootaloo says: "she's..."
Scootaloo says: "great."
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah."
Apple Bloom says: "Great."
Sweetie Belle says: "I really..."
Sweetie Belle says: "like her..."
Sweetie Belle says: "mane."
Twilight Sparkle says: "She even comes with her own notebook and quill, for when you want to pretend she's doing her homework!"
Scootaloo says: "That's..."
Scootaloo says: "um..."
Scootaloo says: "great."
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah..."
Apple Bloom says: "great."
Sweetie Belle says: "I really like her..."
Sweetie Belle says: "mane?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I just hope the fact that there are three of you and only one of her doesn't become a problem!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'd hate to cause a rift between such good friends."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So, who wants to play with her first?"
Apple Bloom says: "Uh..."
Apple Bloom says: "You should play with her first, Sweetie Belle."
Apple Bloom says: "Y'know, 'cause you like her mane so much."
Sweetie Belle says: "Nonononononono."
Sweetie Belle says: "I think Scootaloo should get to play with her first."
Scootaloo says: "I'd love to, but, um, you take her, Apple Bloom."
Apple Bloom says: "Applejack says it's important to share."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ooh, you're going to like Smarty Pants."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And you're going to like her more than anything."
Scootaloo says: "I want it."
Apple Bloom says: "I need it."
Sweetie Belle says: "I really like her mane!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The 'want it, need it' spell."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Works every time."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, okay, let's break it up."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I think we can all see that there is an important lesson to be learned here about—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "ugh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "C'mon, girls, we're all friends here, right?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Don't you think you ought to share?"
Apple Bloom says: "No way!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Big McIntosh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thank goodness!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You've gotta help me get that doll away from those girls!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, thank you so much."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now if you could just give her to me?"
Big McIntosh says: "Nnnope."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh no!"
Apple Bloom says: "Give her back!"
Mayor Mare says: "What's all the commotion about?"
Orange Swirl says: "They're fighting over that doll!"
Sweetie Drops says: "That incredible, amazing doll!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Can't..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "get..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "a clear shot!"
Mayor Mare says: "Gimme!"
Big McIntosh says: "Nope."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, what have I done?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Applejack says: "Y'all hear that?"
Applejack says: "What in the name of all things oats 'n apples is goin' on here?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Don't look at it!"
Rarity says: "Don't look at what?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "My Smarty Pants doll!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I enchanted her and now everypony is fighting over her!"
Fluttershy says: "Why would you enchant your doll?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, I had to do something!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I had nothing to report to Princess Celestia!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I thought if I couldn't find a problem, I'd make a problem!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The day is almost over!"
Applejack says: "Not almost!"
Princess Celestia says: "Twilight Sparkle!"
Applejack says: "Whoa nelly."
Smarty Pants doll squeaks.
Princess Celestia says: "Meet me in the library."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Goodbye, girls."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If you care to visit, I'll be in magic kindergarten, back in Canterlot."
Fluttershy says: "Magic kindergarten?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Canterlot?"
Pinkie Pie says: "We're never gonna see Twilight again!"
Applejack says: "Uh, what are we gonna do, y'all?"
Rarity says: "Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE."
Rarity says: "WORST."
Rarity says: "POSSIBLE."
Rarity says: "THING!"
Rarity says: "What?"
Rarity says: "I really mean it this time!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "but..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm supposed to send you a letter about friendship every week."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I missed the deadline."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm a bad student!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "tardy!"
Princess Celestia says: "You are a wonderful student, Twilight."
Princess Celestia says: "I don't have to get a letter every week to know that."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Really?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wait!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You can't punish her!"
Applejack says: "It wasn't her fault!"
Princess Celestia says: "I'm listening."
Fluttershy says: "Please, your Highness."
Fluttershy says: "We all saw that Twilight was upset."
Rainbow Dash says: "But we thought that the thing she was worrying about wasn't worth worrying about."
Applejack says: "So when she ran off all worked up, not a single one of us tried to stop her."
Rarity says: "As Twilight's good friends, we should have taken her feelings seriously and been there for her!"
Fluttershy says: "Please don't take her away from us just because we were too insensitive to help her."
Princess Celestia says: "Looks like you all learned a pretty valuable lesson today."
Applejack says: "Mm-hmm."
Fluttershy says: "Mm-hmm."
Pinkie Pie says: "Mm-hmm."
Rainbow Dash says: "Mm-hmm."
Rarity says: "Mm-hmm."
Princess Celestia says: "Very well."
Princess Celestia says: "I'll forget Twilight's "punishment" on one condition."
Princess Celestia says: "From this day forth, I would like you all to report to me your findings on the magic of friendship when, and only when, you happen to discover them."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Princess Celestia, wait!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "How did you know I was in trouble?"
Princess Celestia says: "Your friend Spike made me aware that you were letting your fears get the best of you."
Princess Celestia says: "I commend him for taking your feelings seriously."
Princess Celestia says: "Now, if you will all excuse me, I must return to Canterlot."
Princess Celestia says: "I'm expecting some mail."
Applejack says: "Y'all heard the Princess."
Applejack says: "Spike, take a letter."
We're writin' to you because today we all learned a little somethin' about friendship.
Fluttershy says: "We learned that you should take your friends' worries seriously."
Rainbow Dash says: "Even if you don't think that she has anything to worry about."
Rarity says: "And that you shouldn't let your worries turn a small problem..."
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "into an enormously huge entire-town-in-total-chaos Princess-has-to-come-and-save-the-day problem."
Applejack says: "Signed, your loyal subjects."
Spike says: "P."
Spike says: "S."
Spike says: "Obviously Spike did not have to learn a lesson, because he is the best, most awesome friend a pony could ask for."
Spike says: "Unlike everypony else, he took things seriously, and- Eheh..."
Spike says: "uh..."
Spike says: "yeah..."
Spike says: "I'll just, um..."
