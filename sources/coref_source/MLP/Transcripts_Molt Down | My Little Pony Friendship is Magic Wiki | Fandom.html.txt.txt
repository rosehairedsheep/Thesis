Rarity says: "I do appreciate you showing me the way to the phoenix nests, Spike."
Spike says: "Anything for you, Rarity."
Spike says: "Besides, I've been meaning to visit Peewee."
Rarity says: "He really was an excellent pet."
Rarity says: "I can't imagine why you set him free."
Spike says: "Phoenixes aren't meant to be domesticated."
Spike says: "Even in the wild, they like to keep to themselves."
Rarity says: "Well, they are beautiful."
Rarity says: "A few of their feathers will add just the right splash of color to my latest—"
Rarity says: "Spike!"
Rarity says: "What are you doing?"
Spike says: "Uh, nothing!"
Rarity says: "Is there something wrong with your face?"
Spike says: "And embarrassing."
Rarity says: "Ooh, precious pants, that does look uncomfortable."
Rarity says: "But even I get the odd blemish from time to time."
Rarity says: "It's nothing to be embarrassed by."
Rarity says: "You could pay Zecora a visit."
Rarity says: "She makes a cream that works wonders."
Rarity says: "Just don't get the shampoo."
Spike says: "There's Peewee's parents!"
Spike says: "But I don't see Peewee."
Rarity says: "Oh, maybe he moved out."
Rarity says: "Everypony has to leave the nest at some point."
Spike says: "Peewee!"
Spike says: "Ouch!"
Rarity says: "Perhaps you should pay Zecora a visit sooner rather than later."
Spike says: "I don't want anypony else to see this."
Spike says: "Besides, I'm sure it'll clear up after a good night's sleep."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can't believe you're still asleep!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's nearly noon, and you promised to help me with my lecture for class today!"
Spike says: "Noon?"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "I slept like a rock!"
Spike says: "Which reminds me – all that sleep probably cleared up my stone scale!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You can go back to sleep if you want."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, what are you doing?"
Spike says: "Hiding from my hideous face!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm sure it feels terrible, but it's just a breakout."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's not the end of the world."
Spike says: "That's easy for you to say."
Spike says: "Your face isn't covered in itchy red spots!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I used to get terrible breakouts any time I had a final exam with Celestia."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Who probably never had a blemish her whole life."
Spike says: "Well, I'm not in magic school."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, but these things can be stress-related."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And you did spend yesterday with Rarity."
Spike says: "What could possibly be stressful about that?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You could try Zecora."
Twilight Sparkle says: "She makes a cream that—"
Spike says: "Works wonders."
Spike says: "I've heard."
Spike says: "But I'm not leaving the castle until my face is back to its adorable self."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fine."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But you're still gonna help me practice my lecture."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The element of generosity and its importance in relation to the other Elements of Harmony—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "My lecture!"
Spike says: "I don't know what happened!"
Spike says: "I just had a sudden case of—"
Spike says: "..."
Spike says: "indigestion."
Spike says: "I'm so sorry!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's okay."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm sure I can rewrite the lecture from my notes."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I have a lot."
Spike says: "I can help you with—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Maybe you should leave the castle after all."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And go somewhere less..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "flammable?"
Spike says: "Hey there, not handsome."
Rarity says: "I believe Shadow Spade herself would approve."
Spike says: "Uh, thanks."
Rarity says: "But I wonder if you wouldn't mind taking it off."
Spike says: "What?"
Spike says: "Oh, I, uh..."
Spike says: "I..."
Rarity says: "Sorry, you'll have to speak up."
Rarity says: "My ears are a little bit clogged or something."
Rarity says: "It's just that I absolutely must have a model for my phoenix feather dress, and nopony else is available."
Spike says: "Sorry, Rarity, but I..."
Spike says: "I am super busy all day giving..."
Spike says: "tours of the school!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Really?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I thought I was giving tours today."
Pinkie Pie says: "Guess not."
Pinkie Pie says: "Free day!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whee!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Woo-hoo!"
Spike says: "Classrooms are that way."
Spike says: "Twilight's office is up there."
Spike says: "This is a fountain."
Tourist Pony says: "Could you slow down a bit?"
Tourist Pony says: "We've come a long way to see the school, and I don't wanna miss anything."
Spike says: "Oh."
Spike says: "Um, yeah."
Spike says: "Sorry."
Tourist Pony says: "I-Is something wrong?"
Spike says: "What?"
Spike says: "Why?"
Spike says: "No!"
Tourist Pony says: "Uh, do all the dragons at this school suffer from scale issues?"
Spike says: "I don't know."
Tourist Pony says: "What?"
Spike says: "I don't..."
Spike says: "know!"
Tourist Pony says: "I-I'm sorry, did-did you say "firework show"?"
Spike says: "This is the school library!"
Spike says: "It's one of the most serene spots on campus, where students can spend time in quiet reflection or study!"
Spike says: "What?!"
Spike says: "!"
Smolder says: "Could you please stop shouting?"
Smolder says: "We're trying to do our homework, and it's kind of distracting."
Spike says: "Was I shouting?!"
Spike says: "!"
Smolder says: "If you're trying to hide, you need to do a better job."
Smolder says: "All I had to do was follow the smoke."
Spike says: "Leave me alone!"
Smolder says: "What?"
Spike says: "Leave!"
Spike says: "Me!"
Spike says: "Alone!"
Smolder says: "I can't under..."
Smolder says: "Was that "sleeves made of foam"?"
Smolder says: "Wow!"
Smolder says: "I have seen some pretty bad molts in my time, but yours takes the cake!"
Spike says: "Molts?"
Smolder says: "The molt?"
Smolder says: "Super painful stone scales, fire burps, uncontrollable volume shifts?"
Smolder says: "It's all part of growing up dragon."
Smolder says: "Congrats!"
Smolder says: "Oh."
Smolder says: "Sorry."
Spike says: "No-no-no-no-no."
Spike says: "The last time I grew up, I turned into a giant greedy monster."
Smolder says: "Greed-induced bigness."
Smolder says: "That's totally different."
Smolder says: "The molt is completely normal."
Smolder says: "Every dragon goes through it."
Smolder says: "Pretty soon, you'll leave and strike out on your own."
Spike says: "Why would I do that?"
Smolder says: "Have you been living with ponies your whole life?"
Spike says: "Uh-huh."
Smolder says: "Oh."
Smolder says: "Well, in the Dragon Lands, a molter's loved ones kicks them out at the first stone scale."
Spike says: "What?"
Spike says: "Why?"
Smolder says: "I think it's biological."
Smolder says: "We call it the "molt effect"."
Smolder says: "I haven't even told you about the smell."
Spike says: "Smell?"
Spike says: "Ugh!"
Smolder says: "Yeah."
Smolder says: "I mean, I love my brother and all, but one whiff, and I was all "See ya!"
Smolder says: ""  Speaking of which..."
Spike says: "Wait!"
Spike says: "Does the molt effect happen to ponies too?"
Spike says: "Twilight already asked me to leave the castle today."
Spike says: "If she kicks me out, where am I gonna live?"
Spike says: "I'm too young to grow up!"
Smolder says: "I'm sure you'll find a nice..."
Smolder says: "..."
Smolder says: "hoard of gems to guard or a village to terrorize."
Smolder says: "Oh, now that dragons and ponies are friends, I guess that's off the table."
Spike says: "So no creature's gonna wanna be around me?"
Smolder says: "Oh, I didn't say that."
Smolder says: "That molt stench is a magnet for predators."
Smolder says: "Tatzlwurms, hydras, rocs..."
Spike says: "Dragons are scared of rocks?"
Smolder says: "R-O-C-S."
Smolder says: "Rocs?"
Smolder says: "Humongous birds of prey that can snack on a molting dragon like candy!"
Spike says: "So Twilight's kicking me out, and the only creatures who don't find me disgusting want to eat me?"
Smolder says: "Seriously, I heard none of that."
Spike says: "Twilight's kicking me out, and the only creatures who don't find me disgusting want to eat me?!"
Spike says: "!"
Smolder says: "Congrats!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Also, where's that brussel-sprouts-covered-in-cotton-candy smell coming from?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Because it is really interesting."
Spike says: "I didn't know where else to go."
Spike says: "I can't take the chance that Twilight will kick me out."
Spike says: "You aren't feeling any molt effects, are you?"
Zecora says: "When it comes to breakouts, I've seen all circumstances."
Zecora says: "But as with the molt smell..."
Zecora says: "let's not take any chances."
Spike says: "Is there anything you can do to cure me?"
Zecora says: "The ailments you have aren't something to cure."
Zecora says: "The molt's a condition that dragons endure."
Spike says: "But if anypony sees or smells me right now, they'll be so grossed out, they'll avoid me forever!"
Zecora says: "Perhaps we can lessen this strange molt effect."
Zecora says: "The smell is the most likely cause, I suspect."
Spike says: "It's all so embarrassing."
Zecora says: "I know you are speaking, but I can't hear a thing."
Zecora says: "Are you talking about teaching asparagus to sing?"
Spike says: "embarrassing!"
Zecora says: "If the goal is to not have your friends all depart, perhaps your volume is where we should start."
Spike says: "Oh, no."
Rarity says: "Zecora!"
Rarity says: "Hello?"
Rarity says: "Are you there?"
Spike says: "I can't let Rarity see me like this!"
Spike says: "Please don't let her know I'm here!"
Rarity says: "Oh, dear!"
Rarity says: "I'm talking even louder than I thought, aren't I?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Zecora says: "I have volume concerns today by the scores."
Zecora says: "But it seems that I'm ready to help you with yours."
Rarity says: "Eh, I-I'm sorry?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "I can't seem to hear anything!"
Rarity says: "I was hoping you could help!"
Rarity says: "I have no idea what happened!"
Rarity says: "One minute, I was sewing phoenix feathers onto a dress, and the next I couldn't hear my own voice!"
Zecora says: "Ah, the feathers of that bird can affect ponies' ears."
Zecora says: "It's a magic ailment I've treated for years."
Rarity says: "I hope you're not busy, but I must have my hearing back!"
Rarity says: "It turns out that I talk to myself while I sew, and without that conversation, I simply can't think!"
Zecora says: "It's a simple cure, and the directions are clear."
Zecora says: "Just one or two drops in each of your ears."
Rarity says: "Oh, and while I am here, do you have any blemish cream?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "Spike is having some scale issues!"
Spike says: "You have no idea!"
Rarity says: "Your cure is working already!"
Zecora says: "The cream that you want is just over here."
Zecora says: "It's a popular potion for all creatures this year."
Rarity says: "Thank you, Zecora."
Rarity says: "I don't mean to be rude, but I do think your hut could use an airing out!"
Zecora says: "Rarity's gone."
Zecora says: "There's no need to hide."
Zecora says: "Though I wonder if we should continue outside."
Zecora says: "Can't treat your symptoms down there on the ground."
Zecora says: "It's safe to come out."
Zecora says: "There's no ponies around."
Spike says: "I'm not hiding from ponies."
Spike says: "I'm hiding from that!"
Spike says: "Did I forget to mention the molt smell attracts predators?"
Zecora says: "That's something that would've been quite nice to know!"
Zecora says: "But it's not worth discussing right now!"
Zecora says: "We should go!"
Spike says: "It's only after me!"
Spike says: "I'll lead it away while you get help!"
Spike says: "This way, birdy-bird!"
Spike says: "Molting dragon over here!"
Spike says: "Okay, maybe this wasn't a good plan."
Zecora says: "You can't hide in a tree!"
Zecora says: "You have to come down!"
Zecora says: "We stand a much better chance on the ground!"
Spike says: "Zecora!"
Spike says: "Bring her back!"
Rarity says: "Oh, Spike."
Rarity says: "What are you doing here?"
Spike says: "Rarity!"
Spike says: "You have to get out of here!"
Spike says: "There's a giant roc trying to eat me!"
Spike says: "It's got Zecora!"
Rarity says: "Yes, what?"
Rarity says: "I was just at Zecora's, but I'm heading back!"
Rarity says: "I can't read these instructions!"
Rarity says: "Does this say "two drops once a day" or "one drop twice a day"?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Spike says: "Rarity, there's no time!"
Spike says: "We have to get help!"
Rarity says: "Yes, my ears are completely clogged!"
Rarity says: "Why, Spike!"
Rarity says: "Your stone scales look worse!"
Rarity says: "Oh, here!"
Rarity says: "I picked up just the thing."
Rarity says: "Ah—"
Zecora says: "Oh, I wish you'd escaped either claw of this bird!"
Zecora says: "But the both of us trapped in the same one's absurd!"
Rarity says: "What?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Spike says: "Let my ponies go!"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, what are you doing?"
Spike says: "If my stone scales didn't itch so much and we weren't in immediate danger, this would be  really embarrassing!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Danger?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, I was headed to Zecora's to get some cream for your scales."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I had no idea you were—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Molt smell?"
Rarity says: "Twilight!"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Was that Rarity?"
Spike says: "And Zecora!"
Spike says: "I tried to save them, but it's all I can do to stop scratching long enough to dive out of the way when that bird attacks!"
Spike says: "Finally!"
Spike says: "I didn't think that itching would ever stop!"
Spike says: "What's happening?!"
Spike says: "!"
Spike says: "I..."
Spike says: "I can't move!"
Spike says: "What just..."
Spike says: "happened?"
Spike says: "Did I just sprout wings?"
Spike says: "I just sprouted wings!"
Spike says: "Whoops."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "How did you get wings?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Spike says: "I don't know!"
Spike says: "But they're pretty aweso– Whoa!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Do you think you can fly up and distract him while I work on freeing Zecora and Rarity?"
Spike says: "Hey, giant chicken!"
Spike says: "If you like dragons so much, come and get me!"
Spike says: "Greetings."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Zecora says: "I know that the molt produced surprising things."
Zecora says: "But I'm glad that the last was a new pair of wings!"
Rarity says: "Yes!"
Rarity says: "And also, I'm glad you've got wings!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is amazing!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I didn't know if you'd ever get wings."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm so happy for you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Does it have something to do with this molt you were talking about?"
Spike says: "It's what's been going on with me."
Spike says: "The breakout, the fire burps."
Spike says: "The molt is when dragons get older and start to change."
Spike says: "I wish I could stop it, but I can't."
Spike says: "I-I should go."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Go?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are you talking about?"
Spike says: "In the Dragon Lands, families make molters leave home."
Spike says: "It's called the molt effect."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, this isn't the Dragon Lands, and molt effect or no, I don't want you going anywhere."
Spike says: "But I'm growing up."
Spike says: "What if something even worse happens?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're supposed to grow up, but you'll always be you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And whatever happens, we'll get through it together."
Spike says: "Woo-hoo!"
Spike says: "Yeah!"
Spike says: "Woo-hoo!"
Spike says: "Look at me!"
Spike says: "Let's go home!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh, I don't need to carry you anymore, do I?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You have wings."
Spike says: "They are new, and I don't want to overdo it."
Rarity says: "I can't believe you thought any of us would send you away because of some silly molt effect."
Rarity says: "Uh, a bit higher, darling, please?"
Spike says: "I'm glad to help, Rarity."
Spike says: "But don't you think there's wonderful things about flying that don't involve dresses?"
Rarity says: "Of course, darling."
Rarity says: "Flying will also be beneficial for you to help me with gowns, frocks, robes, shifts, skirts, minis, maxis..."
