Spike says: "I just wanted everything to be perfect."
Spike says: "I mean, this was a big deal."
Spike says: "But when Discord insists on being involved..."
Discord says: "Regardless of what Spike might say, that little dragon begged me to help."
Discord says: "And let me tell you, he can cause plenty of chaos all on his purple lonesome."
Mrs. Cake says: "I pride myself on baking under pressure, but I just..."
Mrs. Cake says: "Oh, dear..."
Apple Bloom says: "You'd think we would be used to stuff like this in Ponyville."
Sweetie Belle says: "I still have nightmares."
Spike says: "It seemed simple when it started..."
Spike says: "It's beautiful!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Big McIntosh says: "Nope!"
Spike says: "I'm not gonna eat it!"
Discord says: "Eat what?"
Discord says: "What is it!"
Discord says: "I want to see!"
Big McIntosh says: "Nope!"
Discord says: "Why not?!"
Discord says: "!"
Spike says: "Because you have a big mouth."
Discord says: "Me?!"
Discord says: "!"
Discord says: "I keep tons of secrets!"
Discord says: "Like Fluttershy's secret fear of clowns."
Discord says: "Or that time I caught Twilight sleep-trotting through town."
Discord says: "Oh!"
Discord says: "And did you know that Octavia went on a date with Bulk Biceps?"
Discord says: "Talk about an odd couple."
Discord says: "I heard that—"
Discord says: "Oh."
Discord says: "All right."
Discord says: "Point taken."
Discord says: "But we're pals, right?"
Discord says: "Comrades."
Discord says: "Amigos."
Discord says: "Come on!"
Spike says: "Of course Big Mac asked me to help with his proposal."
Spike says: "I'm the most romantic dragon I know."
Discord says: "It really is a curse having infinite powers."
Discord says: "Everypony is always asking you to move a couch or help with a proposal."
Spike says: "Spill it!"
Spike says: "Every detail!"
Spike says: "Don't leave anything out!"
Discord says: "Ugh."
Discord says: "Do we have to hear all the details?"
Discord says: "Is that like a "friend" thing?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Big McIntosh says: "I don't talk much, so I want to show Sugar Belle how committed I am."
Big McIntosh says: "First..."
Spike says: "You're making a picnic table that matches the shelf you made Sugar Belle for her shop when you had a crush on her, and you're setting up a romantic meal overlooking Sweet Apple Acres?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Discord says: "Uh, how did you figure that out?"
Spike says: "If you were a hopeless romantic, you'd know that was the only logical choice."
Big McIntosh says: "Then..."
Spike says: "You painted apples to leave around Ponyville with little riddles tied to the stem that will lead her up here to meet you?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Discord says: "Seriously?!"
Discord says: "!"
Big McIntosh says: "Now..."
Spike says: "Yuh—"
Discord says: "I know!"
Discord says: "You need a giant rhino named Dolores who can knit a romantic sweater for two!"
Big McIntosh says: "Uhhh..."
Big McIntosh says: "nope."
Spike says: "Come on."
Spike says: "He needs food for the picnic."
Spike says: "That was a gimme."
Discord says: "I do not get this game."
Spike says: "Okay."
Spike says: "You finish your table, I'll pick up whatever you need to eat, and Discord will put all the apples in place."
Discord says: "I will?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup!"
Discord says: "He should stick to bucking apples."
Spike says: "Sugar Belle's gonna love it!"
Spike says: "I'll get the food."
Spike says: "How long will it take you to place all the apples?"
Spike says: "Are you sure you put them in the right spots?"
Discord says: "Those terrible riddles on the apples were very clear on the location."
Discord says: "I'm sure that they were placed properly."
Discord says: "I-I-I think."
Discord says: "Maybe."
Discord says: "Does it matter?"
Discord says: "Oh, okay, fine!"
Discord says: "I'll double-check."
Spike says: "She didn't see the apple!"
Spike says: "What are we gonna do?"
Discord says: "Well, we could just give it to her."
Spike says: "That's not romantic!"
Spike says: "She needs to discover it!"
Discord says: "Don't be such a drama dragon."
Discord says: "I've precipitated liquid cocoa on Equestria and herded long-limbed Leporidae."
Discord says: "I can certainly make a pony see an apple."
Spike says: "Hey, Mrs."
Spike says: "Cake."
Spike says: "I need to pick up a few things."
Mrs. Cake says: "Oh, I'm afraid you'll have to wait."
Mrs. Cake says: "I'm a bit busy at the moment."
Mrs. Cake says: "Oh."
Mrs. Cake says: "Is this sour cream or sweet cream?"
Spike says: "Oh, it's kind of important."
Spike says: "Maybe I could take some of these off your hooves?"
Mrs. Cake says: "No!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Those are for..."
Mrs. Cake says: "something important, too!"
Spike says: "All of them?"
Spike says: "There's..."
Spike says: "one, two, three, four—"
Mrs. Cake says: "Twenty-one!"
Mrs. Cake says: "And yes, all of them!"
Spike says: "Who needs twenty-one desserts?"
Mrs. Cake says: "I can't tell you!"
Mrs. Cake says: "It's a secret!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Come by later."
Spike says: "Later won't work."
Mrs. Cake says: "Why not?"
Spike says: "I can't tell you."
Spike says: "It's a secret."
Spike says: "Ugh!"
Spike says: "Did somepony else bake these?"
Mrs. Cake says: "No."
Mrs. Cake says: "Why?"
Spike says: "No reason."
Discord says: "Shhh."
Sugar Belle says: "Thank you!"
Sugar Belle says: "These are perfect!"
Discord says: "You know, if she's too busy to read the horribly written clues, maybe you should just tell her."
Discord says: "Listen up!"
Discord says: "Each of you has a job to do!"
Discord says: "Take a look at your stems!"
Discord says: "Tell me about it."
Discord says: "But regardless, go to your designated location, deliver your messages, and make me proud!"
Discord says: "Dismissed!"
Discord says: "I just have to say, Big Mac is really lucky to have me as a friend."
Mrs. Cake says: "Okay..."
Mrs. Cake says: "One down, twenty to go."
Mrs. Cake says: "Then I can help you."
Spike says: "Maybe I can help you."
Spike says: "Delivering parchments is my thing."
Spike says: "A little dragon breath and fwoosh!"
Spike says: "We deliver each scroll into each dessert."
Spike says: "Then you can help me."
Spike says: "Watch!"
Spike says: "Ta-da!"
Talking Apple says: "Hurry, there's no need to sneak!"
Talking Apple 2 says: "The next apple is at the boutique!"
Talking Apple 3 says: "At Twilight's castle, take a right!"
Talking Apple 3 says: "The next apple sits in plain sight!"
Mrs. Cake says: "What in the blazes is going on?!"
Mrs. Cake says: "!"
Spike says: "Discord."
Discord says: "Oh!"
Discord says: "Are you finally finished?"
Discord says: "I've been done for a while."
Discord says: "You know, thinking back, I probably could have been clearer which pony to deliver the messages to."
Spike says: "You think?"
Discord says: "I sent them back to Sweet Apple Acres."
Discord says: "Apples are terrible at taking directions."
Discord says: "Couldn't even manage to stay in one location."
Discord says: "Now, bananas..."
Discord says: "..."
Discord says: "are much better at listening."
Sugar Belle says: "What's going on?"
Spike says: "Apples running everywhere, and she didn't see the poem to get to the hilltop?!"
Spike says: "!"
Discord says: "Getting her to the hilltop is easy, and not seeing the poems is actually a blessing when you think about it."
Mrs. Cake says: "Why would you think sending flaming messages into my desserts would work?!"
Mrs. Cake says: "!"
Mrs. Cake says: "You've ruined all of them!"
Spike says: "To be honest, I tasted some, and burning them might have been an improvement."
Mrs. Cake says: "What?!"
Mrs. Cake says: "!"
Mrs. Cake says: "I never!"
Big McIntosh says: "Spike?"
Spike says: "Aah!"
Spike says: "Uh, hey there, Big Mac."
Spike says: "Heh."
Spike says: "I bet you're wondering what—"
Big McIntosh says: "Sugar Belle!"
Sugar Belle says: "Big Mac?"
Big McIntosh says: "Discord!"
Discord says: "Mrs."
Discord says: "Cake!"
Mrs. Cake says: "What did I do?!"
Mrs. Cake says: "!"
Discord says: "Nothing."
Discord says: "I thought we were just saying each other's names."
Spike says: "I guess this can't get any worse."
Discord says: "As the Lord of Chaos, I'd advise against saying things like that."
Granny Smith says: "It's comin'!"
Granny Smith says: "Save yourselves!"
Giant Apple says: "sugar belle!!!"
Giant Apple says: "sugar belle!!!"
Apple Bloom says: "We have a bit of a reputation for gettin' carried away."
Sweetie Belle says: "Especially when romance is involved."
Sweetie Belle says: "Heh."
Scootaloo says: "But that wasn't the case with this."
Scootaloo says: "We were just helping Sugar Belle with her plan."
Sugar Belle says: "And the last one should just say "Eeyup!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Three tablespoons..."
Mrs. Cake says: "So, you're saying you want to put each one of those inside a dessert?"
Sugar Belle says: "Well, since Big Mac's plan to send me a Hearts and Hooves Day pie with a message inside didn't go so well, I thought it'd be fun to do it right."
Sweetie Belle says: "Awww!"
Sweetie Belle says: "That's so romantic!"
Sugar Belle says: "He's a pony of few words."
Sugar Belle says: "I love that about him."
Sugar Belle says: "So, I thought I'd use as many words as possible to propose to him!"
Sugar Belle says: "All he has to say is—"
Apple Bloom says: "I can't wait for you to be a part of the family!"
Sugar Belle says: "You three played such a big part in Big Mac and I getting together."
Sugar Belle says: "I'm glad you could help with this."
Scootaloo says: ""I-love-you-Big-Mac-would-you-like-to-spend-the-rest-of-our-lives-together-I-hope-you-say-eeyup!"
Scootaloo says: "" And each word has to go into a dessert?"
Scootaloo says: "That's..."
Scootaloo says: "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven..."
Scootaloo says: "Whoa!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Twenty-one!"
Mrs. Cake says: "I know!"
Sugar Belle says: "Actually, it's twenty-two."
Sugar Belle says: "Mrs."
Sugar Belle says: "Cake was kind enough to help me bake all the apple-flavored treats I made to get Big Mac to visit me in my old shop."
Sugar Belle says: "That one has the invitation for him to come here."
Mrs. Cake says: "Oh, it's..."
Mrs. Cake says: "it's no bother!"
Mrs. Cake says: "I do love a challenge!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Did I add the sugar to this one or to that one?"
Scootaloo says: "I think I've seen her add sugar to that bowl six times so far."
Sugar Belle says: "Now you three go deliver that pie."
Sugar Belle says: "I have to get some flowers to spruce the place up."
Sugar Belle says: "Uh-oh."
Sugar Belle says: "Spike and Discord are outside."
Sugar Belle says: "If they figure out what we're up to, they'll spill the beans!"
Sugar Belle says: "And I want this to be a surprise!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I don't think they suspect anything."
Scootaloo says: "Why would they suspect that we're holding an invitation pie and that Mrs."
Scootaloo says: "Cake is baking a twenty-one-dessert proposal?"
Apple Bloom says: "I can't believe I'm gonna have a sister-in-law!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Shhhhhh!"
Scootaloo says: "Shhhhhh!"
Sweetie Belle says: "This is our shot to make up for all the trouble we caused when Big Mac first asked Sugar Belle out!"
Scootaloo says: "We can't give away the surprise!"
Scootaloo says: "You need to play it cool!"
Apple Bloom says: "Right, right."
Apple Bloom says: "Uh, how's this?"
Scootaloo says: "Better?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Come on!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Let's go find your brother!"
Big McIntosh says: "Screwdriver..."
Big McIntosh says: "Nope."
Apple Bloom says: "Big Mac!"
Apple Bloom says: "He ain't here."
Apple Bloom says: "Let's go."
Scootaloo says: "Hold on..."
Scootaloo says: "That looks just like the shelf Big Mac made for Sugar Belle."
Scootaloo says: "Weird."
Sweetie Belle says: "Maybe we should wait here for him."
Sweetie Belle says: "He's bound to show up soon."
Apple Bloom says: "You know, When I'm lookin' for somethin', Granny says it's best to check the least likely place."
Apple Bloom says: "Come on!"
Big McIntosh says: "Screwdriver!"
Scootaloo says: "Big Mac!"
Apple Bloom says: "Big Mac!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Big Mac!"
Apple Bloom says: "How is Sugar Belle supposed to propose to Big Mac if we can't even find him?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "Mrs."
Scootaloo says: "Cake isn't finished yet."
Scootaloo says: "We still have time."
Apple Bloom says: "You know, when I'm lookin' for somepony, Granny says it's best to just stay in one place."
Apple Bloom says: "Let's head back to the farm and wait."
Apple Bloom says: "Big Mac is sure to show up soon!"
Apple Bloom says: "Well, don't just stand there."
Apple Bloom says: "Come on!"
Large Apple says: "Love is in the air!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeeeeeeeeyup."
Scootaloo says: "Granny!"
Granny Smith says: "Aah!"
Granny Smith says: "Who goes there?!"
Granny Smith says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "Granny, have you seen Big Mac?"
Granny Smith says: "Oh."
Granny Smith says: "Hey there, li'l dumplin'."
Granny Smith says: "I just had the most peculiar dream."
Scootaloo says: "That's nice, Granny, but we really need to find Big Mac, so—"
Granny Smith says: "It was about Grand Pear."
Granny Smith says: "Only it wasn't."
Granny Smith says: "We were in outer space on some kinda mission to explore a strange new world."
Sweetie Belle says: "If we get stuck listening to Granny, we'll never find Big Mac."
Granny Smith says: "And Mudbriar was there, bein' as logical as ever, but his ears was all pointy-like."
Granny Smith says: "And then Discord showed up and..."
Granny Smith says: "well, you know, he was pretty much the same."
Apple Bloom says: "Once she gets goin', there's nothin' in Equestria that can stop her."
Scootaloo says: "You sure about that?"
Big McIntosh says: "Spike?"
Spike says: "Aah!"
Spike says: "Uh, hey there, Big Mac."
Spike says: "Heh."
Spike says: "I bet you're wondering what—"
Big McIntosh says: "Sugar Belle!"
Sugar Belle says: "Big Mac?"
Big McIntosh says: "Discord!"
Discord says: "Mrs."
Discord says: "Cake!"
Mrs. Cake says: "What did I do?!"
Mrs. Cake says: "!"
Discord says: "Nothing."
Discord says: "I thought we were just saying each other's names."
Spike says: "I guess this can't get any worse."
Discord says: "As the Lord of Chaos, I'd advise against saying things like that."
Granny Smith says: "It's comin'!"
Granny Smith says: "Save yourselves!"
Giant Apple says: "sugar belle!!!"
Giant Apple says: "sugar belle!!!"
Big McIntosh says: "Discord!"
Discord says: "Why does everypony immediately assume that this has something to do with me?"
Giant Apple says: "i love you!"
Giant Apple says: "you love me!"
Giant Apple says: "our love will grow like an apple tree!"
Giant Apple says: "So let me ask – will you marry me?"
Discord says: "Okay, but to be fair, the message did get to Sugar Belle."
Discord says: "This whole story is being twisted to make it seem like it was all my fault."
Discord says: "Which it wasn't!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Wait."
Mrs. Cake says: "So you two were orchestrating a proposal?"
Mrs. Cake says: "That's what I was doing!"
Discord says: "Who are you proposing to?"
Apple Bloom says: "Discord!"
Discord says: "Me?!"
Discord says: "!"
Giant Apple says: "i love you!"
Giant Apple says: "i love you!"
Giant Apple says: "i love you!"
Spike says: "So the messages that were in the desserts..."
Mrs. Cake says: "..."
Mrs. Cake says: "were Sugar Belle's proposal to Big Mac before Spike set them on fire!"
Discord says: "Oh, so I'm not the only one who messes things up, am I, Mr."
Discord says: "High-and-Mighty Dragon?"
Spike says: "Hey!"
Spike says: "Those desserts were ruined way before I ruined them!"
Mrs. Cake says: "They were not!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Well, I..."
Mrs. Cake says: "may have mixed up a..."
Mrs. Cake says: "a few ingredients."
Mrs. Cake says: "It was such a rush."
Discord says: "You should both be very disappointed in yourselves."
Scootaloo says: "What about you and your apple monster?!"
Scootaloo says: "!"
Discord says: "Yes, but you all expect that of me."
Apple Bloom says: "All we wanted to do was make up for messin' things up the last time."
Apple Bloom says: "Sugar Belle, Big Mac, we're really—"
Sweetie Belle says: "Where'd they go?"
Discord says: "Okay, this time, it really wasn't me!"
Mrs. Cake says: "I shouldn't have taken all those desserts at once."
Mrs. Cake says: "It's just, how can you say no to such a sweet idea?"
Mrs. Cake says: "Oh!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Ha!"
Mrs. Cake says: ""Sweet"!"
Mrs. Cake says: "I made a joke."
Spike says: "In retrospect, dragon flame and baked goods aren't the best combo."
Apple Bloom says: "We felt like it was all our fault."
Scootaloo says: "Except for the apple monster."
Scootaloo says: "That was Discord."
Scootaloo says: "And Mrs."
Scootaloo says: "Cake messing up those recipes."
Scootaloo says: "And Spike burning the messed-up recipes."
Scootaloo says: "And—"
Sweetie Belle says: "The point is we all felt bad for ruining Big Mac and Sugar Belle's proposals."
Granny Smith says: "It was all green, and then Grand Pear looked at me all dramatical and says, "Where nopony has gone before!"
Granny Smith says: "" And whoosh!"
Granny Smith says: "Away we flew!"
Sugar Belle says: "Today was..."
Sugar Belle says: "interesting."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Sugar Belle says: "You okay?"
Big McIntosh says: "I..."
Big McIntosh says: "I'm sorry, Sugar Belle."
Big McIntosh says: "I wanted everything to go right today."
Big McIntosh says: "I wanted our love to be as perfect as my parents' was when they planted these two trees together."
Big McIntosh says: "Instead, it turned into a mess."
Big McIntosh says: "Just like when I asked you out."
Big McIntosh says: "Just like Hearts and Hooves Day."
Big McIntosh says: "No matter how hard I try, I always seem to mess up when it comes to you."
Sugar Belle says: "I think you've got things backwards."
Big McIntosh says: "What do you mean?"
Sugar Belle says: "From everything you told me about your parents, they had to deal with things a lot tougher than some burnt desserts and an apple monster."
Big McIntosh says: "I..."
Big McIntosh says: "."
Big McIntosh says: "guess that's true."
Sugar Belle says: "This apple tree and pear tree are stronger together."
Sugar Belle says: "They'll survive whatever comes because they don't have to do it alone."
Sugar Belle says: "They belong together."
Sugar Belle says: "Like your parents."
Sugar Belle says: "And like us."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Sugar Belle says: "Today was a disaster."
Sugar Belle says: "But today was also the last day we're ever gonna have to do anything apart."
Sugar Belle says: "From here on out, we'll be together."
Sugar Belle says: "And we'll make sure everything always works out just right."
Sugar Belle, will you—? Sorry.
Big Mac, will you—? No, I'm sorry.
Big McIntosh says: "On three?"
Sugar Belle says: "Sure."
Sugar Belle says: "One..."
Big McIntosh says: "Two..."
Big McIntosh says: "Will you marry me?"
Sugar Belle says: "Will you marry me?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup!"
Sugar Belle says: "Eeyup!"
Sugar Belle says: "We'll have to thank our friends for messing up so bad that they made it all work out perfectly."
Discord says: "Well, we've all made up, and we're here for a do-over."
Discord says: "And this time, thanks to me, we've got it right."
Discord says: "So, why don't you two..."
Discord says: "you know?"
Spike says: "Uh, I think they did okay without us."
Apple Bloom says: "And that's how we were responsible for the perfect proposal!"
Apple Bloom says: "Or, should I say, "pear-posal"."
Sweetie Belle says: "If we hadn't messed up so bad..."
Scootaloo says: "..."
Scootaloo says: "it wouldn't have worked out the way it did!"
Mrs. Cake says: "It's just like baking."
Mrs. Cake says: "Sometimes, it's the mistakes that help you discover something truly special."
Spike says: "And when all the planning and grand gestures go wrong, it reminds you the most romantic things are usually the simplest."
Discord says: "Which is what I knew all along."
Discord says: "You're welcome."
Mayor Mare says: "It is my sincere pleasure to say, for my second Apple family wedding, that I now pronounce you husband and wife."
Mayor Mare says: "You may kiss the bride!"
Discord says: "That's your cue!"
Apples says: "Happy marriage, happy Apples!"
Apples says: "Happy marriage..."
Spike says: "Discord!"
Discord says: "Oh, just let me have this one!"
Apples says: "Happy marriage, happy Apples!"
Apples says: "Happy marriage, happy Apples!"
