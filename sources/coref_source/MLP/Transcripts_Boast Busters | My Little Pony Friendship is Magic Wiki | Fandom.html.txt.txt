Spike says: "Come on, Twilight."
Spike says: "You can do it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, here goes."
Spike says: "Ha ha!"
Spike says: "Ya did it!"
Spike says: "Growing magic, that's number twenty-five."
Spike says: "Twenty-five different types of tricks and counting."
Spike says: "And I think this is the best trick so far."
Spike says: "Hello, Rarity."
Spike says: "What's that?"
Spike says: "Aw, it's nothin', just my awesome mustache."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sorry, Romeo."
Twilight Sparkle says: "As attractive and enticing as you look, it's just for practice, and it's gotta go."
Spike says: "Wait!"
Spike says: "Aw, rats!"
Spike says: "Twenty-five, Twilight."
Spike says: "Twenty-five different kinds of tricks and counting."
Spike says: "I thought unicorns were only supposed to have a little magic that matches their special talents!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "True, for ponies whose talents are for things like cooking or singing or math."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But what if a unicorn's special talent is magic?"
Spike says: "Like you, Twilight, and you know a ton of magic."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Spike, stop."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm sure there are lots of ponies right here in Ponyville that know just as much magic as me."
Spike says: "Are you kiddin'?"
Spike says: "I don't think there's another unicorn in all of Equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight."
Snails says: "Gangway!"
Snails says: "Comin' through!"
Spike says: "Augh!"
Spike says: "Snips, Snails!"
Spike says: "What's goin' on?"
Snails says: "Wha, haven't you heard?"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Snails says: "There's a new unicorn in town!"
Snips says: "Yeah!"
Snips says: "They say that she's got more magical powers than any other unicorn ever!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Really?"
Spike says: "Aw, no way, that honor goes to Twilight here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where is this unicorn?"
Snails says: "Ho, she's in the town square."
Snails says: "Come on!"
Snips says: "Yeah!"
Snips says: "Come on!"
Snips says: "Whooo!"
Trixie says: "Come one, come all!"
Trixie says: "Come and witness the amazing magic of the Great and Powerful Trixie!"
Audience says: "Ooh!"
Trixie says: "Watch in awe as the Great and Powerful Trixie performs the most spectacular feats of magic ever witnessed by pony eyes!"
Rarity says: "My, my, my!"
Rarity says: "What boasting!"
Spike says: "Come on, nopony's as magical as Twi—"
Spike says: "Twi—"
Spike says: "Twi—"
Spike says: "Oh!"
Spike says: "Hey, Rarity, I, uh—"
Spike says: "Mustache!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "There's nothing wrong with being talented, is there?"
Applejack says: "Nothin' at all, 'cep'n when someone goes around showin' it off like a school filly with fancy new ribbons."
Rarity says: "Just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic does not make one better than the rest of us."
Rainbow Dash says: "Especially when ya got me around being better than the rest of us."
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, I mean, yeah, uh, magic shmagic."
Rainbow Dash says: "Boo!"
Trixie says: "Well, well, well, it seems we have some neighsayers in the audience."
Trixie says: "Who is so ignorant as to challenge the magical ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie?"
Trixie says: "Do they not know that they're in the presence of the most magical unicorn in all of Equestria?"
Rarity says: "Just who does she think she is?"
Spike says: "Yeah!"
Spike says: "Since we all know that Twilight here is—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Shhh!"
Spike says: "What?"
Spike says: "What's wrong?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You see the way they reacted to Trixie?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't want anyone thinking I'm a show-off."
Rainbow Dash says: "So, "Great and Powerful Trixie"."
Rainbow Dash says: "What makes you think you're so awesome, anyway?"
Trixie says: "Heh, why, only the Great and Powerful Trixie has magic strong enough to vanquish the dreaded ursa major!"
Audience says: "Ahh!"
Snips says: "What?"
Snails says: "No way!"
Trixie says: "When all hope was lost, the ponies of Hoofington had no one to turn to, but the Great and Powerful Trixie stepped in, and with her awesome magic, vanquished the ursa major and sent it back to its cave deep within the Everfree Forest!"
Snips says: "Saw, sweet!"
Snails says: "Saw, sweet!"
Snips says: "That settles it."
Snails says: "Trixie truly is the most talented, the most magical, the most awesome unicorn in Ponyville."
Snips says: "No, in all of Equestria!"
Spike says: "How do you know?"
Spike says: "You didn't see it!"
Spike says: "And besides, Twi—"
Spike says: "Mmph!"
Spike says: "M-mmph!"
Trixie says: "It's true, my enthusiastic little admirers."
Trixie says: "Trixie is most certainly the best in Ponyville."
Trixie says: "Don't believe the Great and Powerful Trixie?"
Trixie says: "Well then, I hereby challenge you, Ponyvillians."
Trixie says: "Anything you can do, I can do better."
Trixie says: "Any takers?"
Trixie says: "Anyone?"
Trixie says: "Hmm?"
Trixie says: "Or is Trixie destined to be the greatest equine who has ever lived?!"
Trixie says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "There's no way I'm going to use my magic now, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Especially since—"
Trixie says: "Hmm, how about you?"
Trixie says: "Well, how about it?"
Trixie says: "Hm?"
Trixie says: "Is there anything you can do that the Great and Powerful Trixie can't?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I—"
Trixie says: "Well, little hayseed?"
Applejack says: "That's it!"
Applejack says: "I can't stand for no more of this!"
Spike says: "You show her, AJ!"
Applejack says: "Can your magical powers do this?"
Audience says: "Whooo!"
Applejack says: "Top that, missy."
Trixie says: "Oh ye of little talent."
Trixie says: "Watch and be amazed at the magic of Trixie!"
Applejack says: "Whoa!"
Applejack says: "Uh!"
Trixie says: "Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie prevails."
Rainbow Dash says: "There's no need to go struttin' around and showin' off like that."
Trixie says: "Oh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "That's my job!"
Rainbow Dash says: "They don't call me "Rainbow" and "Dash" for nothin'!"
Trixie says: "When Trixie is through, the only thing they'll call you is loser."
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa-a-a-a!"
Rainbow Dash says: "gonna be sick."
Trixie says: "Seems like anypony with a dash of good sense would think twice before tussling with the Great Trixie."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ow!"
Spike says: "What we need is another unicorn to challenge her."
Spike says: "Someone with some magic of her own."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "A unicorn to show this unicorn who's boss."
Applejack says: "A real unicorn to unicorn tussle."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh..."
Rarity says: "Enough."
Rarity says: "Enough, all of you."
Rarity says: "I take your hint, but Rarity is above such nonsense."
Rarity says: "Rainbow Dash and Applejack may behave like ruffians, but Rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace."
Trixie says: "Ooo, what's the matter?"
Trixie says: "Afraid you'll get a hair out of place in that rat's nest you call a mane?"
Rarity says: "Oh, it."
Rarity says: "Is."
Rarity says: "On!"
Rarity says: "You may think you're tough with all of your so-called powers, but there's more to magic than your brutish ways."
Rarity says: "A unicorn needs to be more than just muscle."
Rarity says: "A unicorn needs to have style."
Audience says: "Ooh!"
Rarity says: "A unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty."
Spike says: "Rarity won't let Trixie get the best of her!"
Spike says: "She's strong, she's beautiful, she's—"
Rarity says: "Quick!"
Rarity says: "I need a mirror!"
Rarity says: "Get me a mirror!"
Rarity says: "What did she do to my hair?"
Rarity says: "I know she did something terrible to my hair!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nothing."
Rainbow Dash says: "It's fine."
Applejack says: "It's gorgeous."
Spike says: "It's green."
Spike says: "What?"
Rarity says: "Ugh, no."
Rarity says: "Green hair!"
Rarity says: "Not green hair!"
Golden Harvest says: "Well, I never!"
Spike says: "Well Twilight, guess it's up to you."
Spike says: "Come on, show her what you're made of."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What do you mean?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm nothing special."
Spike says: "Yes, you are!"
Spike says: "You're better than her!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm not better than anyone."
Trixie says: "Hah!"
Trixie says: "You think you're better than the Great and Powerful Trixie?"
Trixie says: "You think you have more magical talent?"
Trixie says: "Well, come on, show Trixie what you've got."
Trixie says: "Show us all."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Who, me?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm just your run-of-the-mill citizen of Ponyville."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No powerful magic here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I, uh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I think I hear my laundry calling."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sorry, gotta go."
Spike says: "Twilight?"
Trixie says: "Ha!"
Trixie says: "Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie has proven herself to be the most amazing unicorn in all of Equestria."
Trixie says: "Huh, was there ever any doubt?"
Snips says: "Here's the oat smoothie you asked for, with extra hay, just how you like it."
Snails says: "Mmm, hay."
Trixie says: "Yes?"
Snips says: "Ooo, tell us another story, Great and Powerful Trixie."
Snails says: "Yeah, tell us about how you vanquished the ursa major."
Trixie says: "Guh!"
Trixie says: "Trixie is far too exhausted from performing feats beyond imagination."
Trixie says: "Begone with you until morning."
Snails says: "Oh, of course, Great and Powerful Trixie."
Snips says: "Anything you say."
Snips says: "We are at your beck and call."
Trixie says: "Ah."
Spike says: "What are you two doin'?"
Snips says: "Just bringin' the Gee an' Pee Tee a—"
Spike says: "The what?"
Snips says: "The Great and Powerful Trixie."
Spike says: "Sheesh."
Snips says: "Just bringin' her a smoothie."
Spike says: "How can you fall for her lameness?"
Spike says: "She's just a show-off."
Spike says: "Unlike Twilight, who—"
Snips says: "The Great and Powerful Trixie vanquished an ursa major."
Snips says: "Can your Twilight claim that?"
Spike says: "Oh really?"
Spike says: "Were you guys actually there?"
Snips says: "Well, eh, uh..."
Snips says: "no, but—"
Spike says: "But nothin'."
Spike says: "The proof is in the pudding."
Snails says: "I like pudding."
Spike says: "Look, unless an ursa major comes waltzing up the street for Trixie to vanquish, I am not gonna believe a word she says, and neither should you!"
Snips says: "Hm, an ursa walkin' up the street, hey?"
Snips says: "Snails!"
Snips says: "You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?"
Snails says: "Why is it they call it a flea market when they don't really sell fleas?"
Snips says: "Yeah, uh..."
Snips says: "oh, come on!"
Spike says: "Twilight, would you put down that book and just listen to me?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Didn't you see how they hated Trixie's bragging, Spike?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "If I go out there and show off my magic, I run the risk of losing them as friends."
Spike says: "It's not the same thing, Twilight."
Spike says: "You'll be using your magic to stand up for your friends!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, Spike, it's exactly the same."
Spike says: "Come on, Twilight, any one of these tricks, even the teeniest, would be enough to show up Trixie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't want to be seen as a bragger like Trixie."
Spike says: "But you're the best!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Please, Spike, I said no!"
Spike says: "If that's the way you want to be, then fine."
Snips says: "Oh, how we gonna find an ursa major when I can't even see my own hoof in front of my face?"
Snails says: "Hold on."
Snips says: "Oh, heh."
Snips says: "That's better."
Snails says: "Yaaaah!"
Snips says: "Yaaaah!"
Spike says: "Hey, guys, where ya goin'?"
Snips says: "Can't talk now."
Snails says: "Got a major problem!"
Snips says: "Yeah, ursa major, to be exact."
Spike says: "Huh?"
Snips says: "Trixie!"
Snails says: "Trixie!"
Spike says: "Twilight!"
Snips says: "Trixie!"
Snails says: "Trixie!"
Trixie says: "Trixie thought she said the Great and Powerful Trixie did not want to be disturbed!"
Snips says: "We—"
Snips says: "We have a—"
Snips says: "a tiny problem."
Snails says: "Actually, it's a big one."
Trixie says: "What is so important that you cannot wait until morning to disturb Trixie?"
Spike says: "Twilight!"
Spike says: "You've gotta come!"
Spike says: "Quick!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I already told you, Spike, I don't wanna show up Trixie!"
Spike says: "No, you don't understand, it's—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh, is that what I think it is?"
Spike says: "Majorly."
Snips says: "Great and Powerful Trixie, you've got to vanquish the ursa."
Snails says: "Yeah, vanquish so we can watch."
Snips says: "It took a lot of trouble to get that thing here."
Trixie says: "Wait, you brought this here?"
Trixie says: "Are you out of your little pony minds?"
Snips says: "But, you're the Great and Powerful Trixie."
Snails says: "Yeah, remember?"
Snails says: "You defeated an ursa major."
Trixie says: "Uh, okay."
Trixie says: "Stand back."
Trixie says: "Heh."
Trixie says: "Piece of cake."
Snips says: "Aw, come on, Trixie."
Snails says: "Stop goofin' around and vanquish it, eh?"
Snails says: "Well, that was a dud."
Snips says: "Yeah, pfft, come on!"
Snips says: "Where's all the cool explosions and smoke and stuff like earlier?"
Snips says: "You know."
Trixie says: "Uh-oh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's going on?"
Snips says: "We brought an ursa to town."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You what?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Snails says: "Don't worry, the Great and Powerful Trixie will vanquish it."
Trixie says: "I can't."
Snips says: "What?!"
Snails says: "What?!"
Snips says: "!"
Snails says: "!"
Trixie says: "Oh, I can't, I never have."
Trixie says: "No one can vanquish an ursa major."
Trixie says: "I just made the whole story up to make me look better."
Snips says: "Made it up?!"
Snails says: "Made it up?!"
Snips says: "!"
Snails says: "!"
Spike says: "Nice use of number sixteen."
Unidentified cow says: "Golly, dont'cha know?"
Spike says: "That's new."
Rainbow Dash says: "Unbelievable!"
Spike says: "That was amazing!"
Applejack says: "Heavens to Betsy!"
Applejack says: "We knew you had ability, but not that much!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm sorry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Please, please don't hate me."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hate you?"
Applejack says: "Hate you?"
Rarity says: "Hate you?"
Rarity says: "Why, whatever do you mean, darling?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Rainbow Dash says: "Magic's got nothing to do with it."
Rainbow Dash says: "Trixie's just a loudmouth."
Rarity says: "Most unpleasant."
Applejack says: "All hat and no cattle."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So, you don't mind my magic tricks?"
Applejack says: "Your magic is a part of who you are, sugarcube, and we like who you are."
Applejack says: "We're proud to have such a powerful, talented unicorn as our friend."
Rainbow Dash says: "And after whuppin' that ursa's hindquarters, we're even prouder."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You are?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh-huh."
Applejack says: "Mm-hmm."
Rarity says: "Mm-hmm."
Spike says: "Wow, Twilight, how'd you know what to do with that ursa major?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's what I was doing when you came looking for me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that I was compelled to do a little reading up on them."
Spike says: "So it is possible to vanquish an ursa major all by yourself?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That wasn't an ursa major."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It was a baby, an ursa minor."
Trixie says: "That was just a baby?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And it wasn't rampaging."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It was just cranky because someone woke it up."
Snips says: "Awww..."
Snails says: "Awww..."
Spike says: "Well, if that was an ursa minor, then what's an ursa major like?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You don't wanna know."
Trixie says: "Huh."
Trixie says: "You may have vanquished an ursa minor, but you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Why, that little..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Just let her go."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Maybe someday she'll learn her lesson."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now, about you two."
Snips says: "Ah."
Snips says: "Uh, we're sorry that we woke up the ursa minor."
Snails says: "We just wanted to see some awesome magic."
Snips says: "Yeah!"
Snips says: "And the way you vanquished that ursa minor was awesome!"
Snails says: "We deserve whatever punishment you give us."
Twilight Sparkle says: "For starters, you can clean up this mess."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What do you think, Spike?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Should I give them number twenty five?"
Spike says: "Oh, twenty five!"
Spike says: "Yes!"
Spike says: "And I think I deserve it, too."
Snips says: "Heah?"
Snails says: "Heah?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I think you're right."
Snips says: "Sweet!"
Snails says: "Sweet!"
Spike says: "Sweet!"
I have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship says: "I was so afraid of being thought of as a show-off that I was hiding a part of who I am."
I have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship says: "My friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud of your talents, and there are times when it's appropriate to show them off..."
I have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship says: "Especially when you're standing up for your friends."
Spike says: "So, you finally admit that you're the most talented unicorn in all of Ponyville?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, yeah, but it's nothing to brag about."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So, uh, how did it go with Rarity?"
Spike says: "Eh, she didn't go for the mustache."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You know, Spike, that mustache has nothing to do with who you really are."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Maybe you should just try being yourself."
Spike says: "Or..."
Spike says: "Maybe the mustache wasn't enough."
Spike says: "Maybe if I had a mustache and a beard?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh, not this again!"
Spike says: "Okay, imagine me with a nice, long, Fu Manchu type beard."
Spike says: "Or maybe a goatee."
Spike says: "Oh, no, a soul patch right on my chin!"
