Cheerilee says: "Let's quiet down please."
Cheerilee says: "We have a very important lesson to get to."
Cheerilee says: "Thank you."
Cheerilee says: "Today we are going to be talking about cutie marks."
Diamond Tiara says: "Bo-ring."
Cheerilee says: "You can all see my cutie mark, can't you?"
Cheerilee says: "Like all ponies, I wasn't born with a cutie mark."
Cheerilee says: "My flank was blank."
Twist says: "Aww..."
Twist says: "!"
Twist says: "She's so precious!"
Cheerilee says: "Then one day, when I was about your age, I woke up to find that a cutie mark had appeared."
[offscreen says: "Look at her hair!"
Cheerilee says: "Yes I know, but honestly, that's how everypony was wearing their mane back then."
Cheerilee says: "I had decided to become a teacher, and the flowers symbolized my hope that I could help my future students bloom if I nurture them with knowledge."
Cheerilee says: "The smiles represented the cheer I hope to bring to my little ponies while they were learning."
Cheerilee says: "Now, can anyone tell me when a pony gets his or her cutie mark?"
Twist says: "Oh!"
Twist says: "Oh!"
Twist says: "Oh!"
Twist says: "When she discovers that certain something that makes her special!"
Cheerilee says: "That's right, Twist."
Cheerilee says: "A cutie mark appears on a pony's flank when he or she finds that certain something that makes them different from every other pony."
Cheerilee says: "Discovering what makes you unique isn't something  or begging, would make a cutie mark appear before its time."
Diamond Tiara says: "Pssst!"
Apple Bloom says: "What?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Cheerilee says: "Apple Bloom!"
Cheerilee says: "Are you passing a note?"
Apple Bloom says: "Uh, I..."
Apple Bloom says: "Um..."
Cheerilee says: "What could be so important that it couldn't wait until after class?"
Cheerilee says: "It's blank."
Twist says: "Want some sweets?"
Twist says: "I've got some peppermint sticks."
Twist says: "I made them myself."
Apple Bloom says: "Mm-mm."
Twist says: "They'll make you smi-i-le."
Apple Bloom says: "No..."
Diamond Tiara says: "I don't know why we had to sit through a lecture about getting a cutie mark."
Diamond Tiara says: "I mean, waiting for your cutie mark is sooo last week."
Diamond Tiara says: "You got yours, I just got mine."
Diamond Tiara says: "We all have them already."
Diamond Tiara says: "I mean, almost all of us have them already."
Diamond Tiara says: "Don't worry, you two, you're still totally invited to my cute-ceañera this weekend."
Silver Spoon says: "It's going to be amazing."
Diamond Tiara says: "It's a party celebrating me and my fantastic cutie mark."
Diamond Tiara says: "How could it not be?"
Diamond Tiara says: "Bump!"
Silver Spoon says: "Bump!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Bump!"
Silver Spoon says: "Bump!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Sugar-lump, rump!"
Silver Spoon says: "Sugar-lump, rump!"
Apple Bloom says: "Gimme a break."
Silver Spoon says: "See you this weekend..."
Apple Bloom says: "It's not fair!"
Apple Bloom says: "It's just not fair!"
Applejack says: "Don't get your mane in a tangle."
Applejack says: "You'll get your cutie mark."
Applejack says: "Everypony gets one eventually."
Apple Bloom says: "But I don't want one eventually!"
Apple Bloom says: "I want one right now!"
Apple Bloom says: "I can't go to Diamond Tiara's cute-ceañera without one, I just can't!"
Applejack says: "'Course you can."
Applejack says: "Y'know, I was the last pony in my class to get my cutie mark, and I couldn't be prouder of it."
Applejack says: "I knew my future was to run Sweet Apple Acres, and these bright shiny apples sealed the deal."
Applejack says: "Come to think of it, Granny Smith was the last one in her class, too."
Applejack says: "Huh, same as Big McIntosh."
Apple Bloom says: "I really don't see how that's supposed to make me feel better."
Apple Bloom says: "It probably means that being the last one in your class to get a cutie mark runs in the family."
Apple Bloom says: "..."
Apple Bloom says: "runs in the family."
Apple Bloom says: "Runs in the family!"
Apple Bloom says: "Runs in the family!"
Apple Bloom says: "You've got apples for your cutie mark, Granny Smith has an apple pie, Big McIntosh has an apple half, my unique talent must has som'n to do with apples!"
Apple Bloom says: "Apples apples apples!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oops..."
Apple Bloom says: "apples."
Applejack says: "Get your delicious, nutritious apples here!"
Apple Bloom says: "Delicious and nutritious, and so many uses!"
[offscreen says: "Hey, watch it!"
Apple Bloom says: "Create fine art for your home with 'em."
Apple Bloom says: "You have to be crazy not to get a bushel of your very own."
Applejack says: "Heh..."
Applejack says: "she's so creative, heh."
Apple Bloom says: "You, sir, care t' buy some apples?"
Dr. Hooves says: "No thanks."
Apple Bloom says: "Why not?"
Dr. Hooves says: "I have plenty at home."
Apple Bloom says: "Are you sure?"
Dr. Hooves says: "Yes, I'm pretty sure I..."
Apple Bloom says: "You're pretty sure, but you're not absolutely positively completely super-duper sure, are you?"
Dr. Hooves says: "Y..."
Dr. Hooves says: "ah..."
Dr. Hooves says: "If I buy some apples, will you please leave me alone?"
Apple Bloom says: "All right!"
Applejack says: "You forgot your change!"
Apple Bloom says: "Woo-hoo!"
Apple Bloom says: "That's how you sell s'm apples and get a cutie mark!"
Apple Bloom says: "So, what does my cutie mark look like?"
Apple Bloom says: "A shoppin' bag full of apples?"
Apple Bloom says: "A satisfied customer eating an apple?"
Apple Bloom says: "Hmm..."
Apple Bloom says: "maybe I gotta increase my sales figures first."
Apple Bloom says: "You touch it, you buy it!"
Apple Bloom says: "We take cash or credit."
Applejack says: "I'm sorry, ma'am."
Applejack says: "Ma'am!"
Applejack says: "Aww..."
Applejack says: "Now Apple Bloom, you can't just..."
Apple Bloom says: "That'll be four bits."
Sweetie Drops says: "I didn't put those in my bag."
Apple Bloom says: "Likely story."
Apple Bloom says: "Four bits, lady!"
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom!"
Applejack says: "I am really really sorry about that."
Applejack says: "She's new."
Applejack says: "Here, take these."
Applejack says: "No charge."
Applejack says: "And these."
Applejack says: "And these."
Applejack says: "Y'all come back now, y'hear?"
Apple Bloom says: "What?"
Applejack says: "Sorry, little sis, but your apple-sellin' days are over."
Apple Bloom says: "What?"
Apple Bloom says: "But how else am I gonna get my cutie mark?"
Applejack says: "Home."
Applejack says: "Now."
Apple Bloom says: "Hm!"
Applejack says: "Ugh."
Applejack says: "Listen, sugarcube, I know it's hard to wait for your very own cutie mark, but, you just can't force it."
Applejack says: "Besides, you're not that grown-up just yet."
Applejack says: "Ain't there other fillies in your class without one?"
Apple Bloom says: "Well..."
Apple Bloom says: "Twist doesn't have hers yet."
Applejack says: "Do you think you'd feel better if you went to the party with her?"
Apple Bloom says: "Mmm-hmm."
Applejack says: "Well there you go."
Applejack says: "Bet you and Twist would have a great time together."
Applejack says: "Now run along and find your friend."
Apple Bloom says: "You're sure you don't want me to stick around 'til the end of th' market?"
Ace Point says: "Hey!"
Ace Point says: "Who's been using my racket?"
Applejack says: "Yeah."
Applejack says: "I'm sure."
Twist says: "Oh, what's up, Apple Bloom?"
Apple Bloom says: "So I was thinkin'..."
Apple Bloom says: "maybe we could go to Diamond Tiara's cute-ceañera together."
Apple Bloom says: "I don't have a cutie mark, you don't have a cutie mark."
Twist says: "Well, um..."
Twist says: "Isn't my cutie mark swell?"
Twist says: "I've always loved making my own favorite sweets, but it took me some time to discover that it was my super-special talent."
Twist says: "Pretty sweet, huh?"
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah, pretty..."
Apple Bloom says: "sweet."
Twist says: "Hey..."
Twist says: "this doesn't mean we can't go to the cute-ceañera together."
Twist says: "You're still gonna come to the party, are you?"
Diamond Tiara says: "Of course she will."
Silver Spoon says: "It's not like being the only pony there without a cutie mark would be, like, the most embarrassing thing ever."
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa, looks like somepony's got a dark cloud hanging over her head."
Rainbow Dash says: "Let me do something about that."
Rainbow Dash says: "What's the matter, kid?"
Apple Bloom says: "There's a cute-ceañera this afternoon and everypony in my class will be there and they'll all have their cutie marks and I wanna get my cutie mark but I'm no good at sellin' apples but I really wanna go to the party but how can I go to the party if I don't have my cutie mark which my big sister says I'm gonna get eventually but..."
Apple Bloom says: "I WANT IT NOW!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Cutie mark?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I can get you a cutie mark like that!"
Apple Bloom says: "Applejack says these things take time."
Apple Bloom says: "I have to just wait for it to happen."
Rainbow Dash says: "Why wait for something to happen when you can make it happen?"
Apple Bloom says: "But Applejack says th..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, who are you gonna listen to, Applejack, or the pony who was first in her class to get a cutie mark?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I always liked flying an' all, but I was going nowhere in a hurry."
Rainbow Dash says: "It wasn't until my very first race that I discovered a serious need for speed, and KAZAM, this sweet baby appeared as fast as lightning."
Rainbow Dash says: "That's right, stretch out those legs."
Rainbow Dash says: "Gotta be nice and loose."
Rainbow Dash says: "The key here is to try as many things as possible as quickly as possible."
Rainbow Dash says: "One of them is bound to lead to your cutie mark."
Rainbow Dash says: "Are you ready?"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm ready!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I said: Are!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ready!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'M READY!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Juggling, go!"
Apple Bloom says: "Ah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hang-gliding, go!"
Apple Bloom says: "Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Karate, go!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hi-ya!"
Apple Bloom says: "Ee..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Kite-flying, go!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ultrapony Roller Derby, go!"
Apple Bloom says: "Whoaaa!"
Apple Bloom says: "Whoa..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Tried that one..."
Rainbow Dash says: "tried that one..."
Rainbow Dash says: "tried that one..."
Silver Spoon says: "Your new outfit is, like, perfect for the party."
Diamond Tiara says: "I know."
Diamond Tiara says: "It totally shows off my cutie mark."
Silver Spoon says: "I love being special."
Diamond Tiara says: "Can you imagine how embarrassing it must be to be..."
Diamond Tiara says: "not special?"
Silver Spoon says: "I don't even want to, like, think about it."
Rainbow Dash says: "Tried that one..."
Rainbow Dash says: "tried that one..."
Apple Bloom says: "I'm doomed."
Apple Bloom says: "Doomed!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'll never find sumth'n I'm good at."
Pinkie Pie says: "You look like you'd be good at eating cupcakes."
Apple Bloom says: "Eatin' cupcakes?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Eating cupcakes?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Eating cupcaaakes!"
Apple Bloom says: "I really appreciate all your help, Rainbow Dash."
Apple Bloom says: "You're a really great coach and I really learned a lot from you and I'm sure I can learn a lot more but..."
Apple Bloom says: "I've got some cupcakes to eat!"
Apple Bloom says: "See you at the cute-ceañera!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hold on, Pinkie Pie, I'm comin'."
Apple Bloom says: "I can't believe I didn't think of this."
Apple Bloom says: "A cupcake-eating cutie mark, it's sooo obvious."
Apple Bloom says: "Now, where are those cupcakes?"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm ready t' chow down!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I don't have any cupcakes."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh."
Pinkie Pie says: "But you look like you'd be good at helping me make some."
Apple Bloom says: "I guess, uh, making-cupcakes cutie mark could work too."
Pinkie Pie.
All you have to do is take a cup of flour!
Add it to the mix!
Now just take a little something sweet, not sour!
A bit of salt, just a pinch!
Baking these treats is such a cinch!
Add a teaspoon of vanilla!
Add a little more, and you count to four,.
And you never get your fill of...
Cupcakes! So sweet and tasty!
Cupcakes! Don't be too hasty!
Cupcakes! Cupcakes, cupcakes, CUPCAKES!
Apple Bloom says: "Hot, hot, hot!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oooh, those look much better than the last batch."
Pinkie Pie says: "Mmm..."
Apple Bloom says: "Ugh!"
Apple Bloom says: "I guess I'm not cut out to be a baker either."
Apple Bloom says: "I just have to face it, I'm gonna have a blank flank forever."
Pinkie Pie says: "What about that?"
Apple Bloom says: "What about what?"
Apple Bloom says: "Is there something on my flank?"
Apple Bloom says: "Is there, is there, is there?"
Apple Bloom says: "A cutie mark!"
Apple Bloom says: "It's a..."
Apple Bloom says: "a measuring cup?"
Apple Bloom says: "No."
Apple Bloom says: "A mixin' bowl?"
Apple Bloom says: "No..."
Apple Bloom says: "Are those cupcakes?"
Apple Bloom says: "A tower of cupcakes maybe."
Pinkie Pie says: "Flour."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's flour!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yay!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I guessed it."
Pinkie Pie says: "What game you wanna play next?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Please say bingo, please say bingo."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Whoa, what's been going on in here?"
Pinkie Pie says: "We've been making cupcakes, wanna try them?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nnnno thank you..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "not that they don't look, heh, delicious."
Apple Bloom says: "Twilight, you have to help me!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's the matter?"
Apple Bloom says: "Tiara's cute-ceañera's today and everypony in my class will be there and they'll all have their cutie marks and I want to get my cutie mark but I'm no good at selling apples or hang-gliding or making cupcakes, but I wanna go to the party but how can I go to the party if I don't have my cutie mark, which Pinkie Pie says I can't just make appear, but I need it to appear, right now!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uhhh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't follow."
Twilight Sparkle says: "How can I help you?"
Apple Bloom says: "You can use your magic to make my cutie mark appear."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh no, Apple Bloom."
Twilight Sparkle says: "A cutie mark is something a pony has to discover for herself."
Apple Bloom says: "Please Twilight, jus' trah."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh please, please, please please please!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "All right, all right!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh thank you thank you thank you."
Apple Bloom says: "Yes!"
Apple Bloom says: "I knew you could do..."
Apple Bloom says: "it."
Apple Bloom says: "Try again, try again!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Told you that not even magic can make a cutie mark appear before its time."
Apple Bloom says: "It's hopeless, hopeless!"
Apple Bloom says: "I just won't go to the party, I can't go."
Apple Bloom says: "Everyone will just laugh at me and make fun of me and call me names."
Apple Bloom says: "It will be the worst night of my life."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm sure it won't be as bad as all that."
Apple Bloom says: "Forget it, there's no way I'm going to that  party."
Apple Bloom says: "How could I have forgotten the time?"
Apple Bloom says: "How could I have forgotten Pinkie Pie was hosting the party?"
Apple Bloom says: "How could I have forgotten it was at Sugarcube Corner?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't forget your party hat, Forgetty Forgetterson!"
Apple Bloom says: "I have to get out of here before anypony sees me."
Diamond Tiara says: "Hey!"
Diamond Tiara says: "It's my cute-ceañera, I'm supposed to get the first bite at cake."
Apple Bloom says: "Okay, Apple Bloom, almost there."
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom, you made it."
Applejack says: "After I heard about Twist, I was afraid you wouldn't show up."
Applejack says: "I sure am glad you came to your senses about this whole cutie mark thing."
Applejack says: "These things happen when these things are supposed to happen."
Applejack says: "Trying to rush 'em just drives you crazy."
Applejack says: "I'll let you be, looks like your friends want to talk to you."
Diamond Tiara says: "Well well well, look who's here."
Silver Spoon says: "Nice outfit."
Apple Bloom says: "Just sumt'n I, uh, pulled together last minute."
Diamond Tiara says: "It really shows off your cutie mark."
Diamond Tiara says: "Oh wait, that's right, you don't have one."
Apple Bloom says: "Uh, I have a cutie mark."
Silver Spoon says: "Eh, what?"
Silver Spoon says: "Since when?"
Apple Bloom says: "Since..."
Apple Bloom says: "Um..."
Apple Bloom says: "Earlier today."
Diamond Tiara says: "Oh really?"
Diamond Tiara says: "Let's see it."
Apple Bloom says: "I shouldn't."
Apple Bloom says: "I couldn't."
Apple Bloom says: "My cutie mark is so unbelievably amazing, I'm afraid that if I show it off, everyone will start paying attention to me instead of you."
Apple Bloom says: "Outshined at your own cute-ceañera."
Apple Bloom says: "Can you imagine how embarrassing that would be?"
Diamond Tiara says: "Uh, forget it, I didn't really want to see it anyway."
Apple Bloom says: "Okay, well, I'm gonna go mingle."
Apple Bloom says: "Enjoy your party."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh no."
Silver Spoon says: "Wow, that is an amazing cutie mark."
Diamond Tiara says: "Nice try..."
Diamond Tiara says: "Blank flank!"
Silver Spoon says: "Blank flank!"
Scootaloo says: "You got a problem with blank flanks?"
Scootaloo says: "I said, you got a problem with blank flanks?"
Silver Spoon says: "The problem is, I mean, she's like, totally not special."
Sweetie Belle says: "No, it means she's full of potential."
Scootaloo says: "It means she could be great at anything."
Scootaloo says: "The possibilities are,  like, endless."
Sweetie Belle says: "She could be a great scientist, or an amazing artist, or a famous writer."
Sweetie Belle says: "She could even be mayor of Ponyville someday."
Scootaloo says: "And she's not stuck being stuck-up like you two."
Diamond Tiara says: "Hey, this is my party, why are you two on her side?"
Scootaloo says: "Because..."
Apple Bloom says: "You don't have your cutie marks either?"
Apple Bloom says: "I thought I was the only one."
Scootaloo says: "We thought we were the only two."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I for one think you are three very lucky fillies."
Diamond Tiara says: "Lucky?"
Diamond Tiara says: "How can they be lucky?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "They still get to experience the thrill of discovering who they are, and what they're meant to be."
Applejack says: "And they got all the time in the world to figure it out, not just an afternoon."
"Tornado Bolt" says: "Wow, Apple Bloom, I wish I could be a scientist."
"Piña Colada" says: "Do you really think you could be mayor?"
"Coronet" says: "Maybe I got my cutie mark too soon."
Diamond Tiara says: "Hey, what's everypony doing?"
Diamond Tiara says: "This is my party, everypony is supposed to be paying attention to me."
Silver Spoon says: "Whatever."
Silver Spoon says: "We still think you're losers, right, Diamond Tiara?"
Silver Spoon says: "Bump, bump, sugar..."
Silver Spoon says: "lump..."
Diamond Tiara says: "Not now, Silver Spoon."
Scootaloo says: "Name's Scootaloo."
Sweetie Belle says: "And I'm Sweetie Belle."
Apple Bloom says: "Apple Bloom."
Twist says: "This song is so super!"
Apple Bloom says: "So I was thinking, now that we're friends..."
Apple Bloom says: "I mean, we are friends, right?"
Scootaloo says: "How could we not be?"
Scootaloo says: "We're totally alike."
Sweetie Belle says: "Totally crazy."
Apple Bloom says: "Well, now that we're friends, what if the three of us work together to find out who we are and what we're supposed to be?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Ooh!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Ooh!"
Sweetie Belle says: "We could form our own secret society."
Scootaloo says: "I'm liking this idea."
Apple Bloom says: "A secret society."
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah."
Apple Bloom says: "We need a name for it though."
Scootaloo says: "The Cutie Mark Three?"
Sweetie Belle says: "The Cutastically Fantastics?"
Apple Bloom says: "How about..."
Apple Bloom says: "The Cutie Mark Crusaders?"
Scootaloo says: "It's perfect!"
Sweetie Belle says: "This is gonna be so great!"
Apple Bloom says: "We're gonna be unstoppable!"
Scootaloo says: "What do you say we celebrate with some of these delicious cupcakes?"
Apple Bloom says: "Not the cupcakes."
Apple Bloom says: "Trust me."
Sweetie Belle says: "Let's see if there are any cookies."
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah!"
Apple Bloom says: "Come on."
I am happy to report that one of your youngest subjects has learned a valuable lesson about friendship. Sometimes, the thing you think will cause you to lose friends and feel left out...
Princess Celestia says: "..."
Princess Celestia says: "can actually be the thing that helps you make your closest friends and realize how special you are."
Princess Celestia says: "Hmm..."
