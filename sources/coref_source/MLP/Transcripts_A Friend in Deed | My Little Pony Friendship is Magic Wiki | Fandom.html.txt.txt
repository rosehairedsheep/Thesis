Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "What have you done?!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "There!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, all better?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "No, not all better, all soggy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm sorry, Cranky!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Oh, you're sorry!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Well, then, everything is fine!"
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "It is?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "No!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "It isn't!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Listen to me, kid, I will never be your friend!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Never, or never-ever?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Never, ever, ever, ever, ever!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's four 'evers'."
Pinkie Pie says: "That's like..."
Pinkie Pie says: "forever!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I just can't believe it."
Pinkie Pie says: "Cranky said he would never forever be my friend."
Pinkie Pie says: "It was horrible."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know this is hard for you, Pinkie, seeing that you're friends with everypony, but you just have to accept that Cranky is gonna be an exception."
Twilight Sparkle says: "He just..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "doesn't want to be bothered."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, he doesn't want to be bothered by your over-the-top super-hyper antics."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No, no, it's okay, Twilight."
Pinkie Pie says: "I get what you're saying."
Pinkie Pie says: "What you're both saying."
Pinkie Pie says: "And I guess..."
Pinkie Pie says: "I can leave Cranky alone."
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Right after he accepts my apology!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Cranky!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "No!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "No!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Leave me alone!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I understand that you don't want me as a friend!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "No, I don't!"
Pinkie Pie says: "So I just wanted to say 'I'm sorry'!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Fine!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "You said it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "But do you accept my apology?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "No!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, Cranky!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Please accept my apology!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Please!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "No!"
Pinkie Pie says: "But I'm really, really, really..."
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "really, really..."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Ah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "really, really, really..."
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "really, really, really..."
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "really, really, really..."
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "really, really, really, really..."
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "really, really, really, really..."
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "sorry!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Cranky, please, please accept my apology!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'd do anything to make it up to you!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "But there's nothing you can do!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "You ruined my book!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "You destroyed all I have to remember her by!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Her?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Her who?"
Pinkie Pie says: "The special friend?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Go away, Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Cranky?"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's me again."
Pinkie Pie says: "I understand that you don't wanna be my friend or accept my apology..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Before I leave you alone forever, I have something to at least try to make up for ruining your book."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "No, I don't want it, kid!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Anything you would give me is sure to lead to some sort of disaster!"
Matilda says: "Goodness, you really are cranky."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "It can't be..."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Is it really you?"
Matilda says: "It can, and it is."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Matilda!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "But how?"
Matilda says: "Pinkie."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "But..."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "I never told you about her!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You didn't have to."
Pinkie Pie says: "I put two and two and two together and it added up to Matilda."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "What?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, when you were talking about your souvenirs, you said something about trying to find a special friend!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And y'know, I wasn't just born yesterday."
Pinkie Pie says: "Nuh-uh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "My birthday isn't for another seventy five days!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Huh?"
Pinkie Pie says: "And then, in your scrapbook, there was a flower, an old ticket, and a menu from the Grand Galloping Gala!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And I knew I recognized all these things."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "But how could you have ever seen them before?"
Matilda says: "Because I also have them in my scrapbook."
Pinkie Pie says: "And I'd seen them in Matilda's book!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Oh, Matilda."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "The night we met at the Gala was the most magical night of my life."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "I couldn't wait to see you again."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "But when I came to your room the next day, you were gone."
Matilda says: "Didn't you get my note?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "No, I never got it."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Ever since that day I've gone from town to town to town, searching all over Equestria for you..."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "..."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Until finally I gave up."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "I came to Ponyville to retire from my search."
Matilda says: "I was living in Ponyville the whole time."
Matilda says: "I always hoped that some day you would come and find me..."
Matilda says: "Doodle."
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh."
Pinkie Pie says: "Matilda?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Nopony calls him Doodle."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Nopony..."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "but Matilda."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Mmm."
Matilda says: "Oh, Doodle, I'm so happy to see you."
Pinkie Pie says: "So does this mean that you accept my apology?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Yes, Pinkie, I accept your apology, and I am honored to call you my friend."
Pinkie Pie says: "party!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, I have to throw you guys a big party!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It'll be called the 'Welcome to Ponyville/I Found My Lost Love/I'm BFF's with Pinkie Pie' Party!"
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Or maybe something less over-the-top and not so super-hyper."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Pinkie, we're eternally grateful to you."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "But..."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Matilda and I just want to spend some time together in peace and quiet."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh."
Pinkie Pie says: "Um, but we're still friends?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Pinkie, you went way, way, way out of your way to make me happy."
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Of course we're friends."
Pinkie Pie says: "Great!"
There are many different kinds of friends, and many ways to express friendship. Some friends like to run and laugh and play together. But others just like to be left alone, and that's fine too. But the best thing about friendship is being able to make your friends smile.
Pinkie Pie.
He had a Cranky Doodle sweetheart.
She's his cranky doodle joy.
I helped the Cranky Doodle boy, yeah!
I helped the Cranky Doodle boy!
Cranky Doodle Donkey says: "Pinkie!"
Matilda says: "Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoops, privacy."
Pinkie Pie says: "Sorry."
