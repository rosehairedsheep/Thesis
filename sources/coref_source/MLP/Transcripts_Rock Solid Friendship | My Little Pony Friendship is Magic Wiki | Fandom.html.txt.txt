Rusty Tenure says: "So in closing, earning a rocktorate in rock studies from the Equestrian Institute of Rockology is no easy feat."
Rusty Tenure says: "I'm proud of each and every one of you."
Rusty Tenure says: "Uh..."
Rusty Tenure says: "each of..."
Rusty Tenure says: "No, just you, actually."
Pinkie Pie says: "Go, Maud!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Woo-hoo!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Number one!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Number one!"
Rusty Tenure says: "Fillies and gentlecolts..."
Rusty Tenure says: "and is that magnesium-rich basalt?"
Rusty Tenure says: "It is my honor to present our vale-rock-torian, Maud Pie."
Rusty Tenure says: "Excuse me."
Rusty Tenure says: "Doctor Pie."
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoo!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Doctor Pie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Doctor Pie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: ""Rock-tor" Pie?"
Maud Pie says: "I'm Maud."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah, you are!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Brilliant speech!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Encore!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Encore!"
Maud Pie says: "Pie."
Maud Pie says: "Thank you."
Pinkie Pie says: "You are so welcome!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Brilliant speech!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Encore!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Encore!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Encore!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You're moving to Ponyville!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We'll live together and get bunk beds and I'll make us fuzzy slippers that say "Best Sister Friends Forever", although I probably can't fit all those words on a slipper, so maybe just "BSFF", but we don't have to decide right now because we'll be together all the time since when it comes to Ponyville, the doctor is in!"
Maud Pie says: "Slow down, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yooooouuuuu'rrrrrrrreeeeeeee mmmmmmmmmmooooooooovvvvvvvviiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnggggggg tttttttooooooo Pooooooooooonnnnnnnnyyyyyyyyvvvvvvviiiiiiilllllllleeeeeeeee..."
Pinkie Pie says: "."
Maud Pie says: "I'm not definitely moving to Ponyville."
Pinkie Pie says: "Of course you are, silly."
Pinkie Pie says: "You said..."
Maud Pie says: "I'm also considering Ghastly Gorge."
Pinkie Pie says: "Classic Maud sense of humor!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You should do stand-up!"
Maud Pie says: "I do."
Maud Pie says: "But that wasn't a joke."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ghastly Gorge?"
Pinkie Pie says: "That terrible, awful, no-fun, all-alone canyon in the middle of nowhere?"
Maud Pie says: "There or Ponyville."
Pinkie Pie says: "But Ponyville is so "eee-hee-hee-hee-hee!"
Pinkie Pie says: "" and Ghastly Gorge is so "Blegh!"
Maud Pie says: "It's a rock-based decision."
Pinkie Pie says: "But what about BSFFs?"
Maud Pie says: "That's why I'm giving Ponyville a chance."
Pinkie Pie says: "Phew!"
Pinkie Pie says: "So all I have to do is prove Ponyville has better rocks than Ghastly Gorge?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Challenge accepted."
Pinkie Pie says: "We'll drop your stuff off at my place, and then hold onto your world, 'cause it's about..."
Pinkie Pie says: "to..."
Pinkie Pie says: "get..."
Pinkie Pie says: "rocked!"
Maud Pie says: "Okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ghastly Gorge may have rocks, but our gem cave rocks!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Huh?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Huh?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, and look!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You'll never know who you'll see!"
Rarity says: "Maud, darling!"
Rarity says: "It's lovely to see you again!"
Rarity says: "Oh!"
Rarity says: "Congratulations on your rocktorate."
Rarity says: "What are you doing now?"
Maud Pie says: "Talking to you."
Rarity says: "Oh, y—"
Rarity says: "Right."
Rarity says: "Well, if your trained eye happens to see a chartreuse gem, I'm desperate to find one."
Maud Pie says: "I found one."
Rarity says: "Oh, you're an absolute darling!"
Rarity says: "This will surely make my gown stand out at Countess Coloratura's album release party."
Rarity says: "Do you know how rare this is?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Just another day in Ponyville!"
Maud Pie says: "That's actually a really common gem."
Pinkie Pie says: "Huh?"
Rarity says: "Huh?"
Maud Pie says: "These are all really common gems."
Pinkie Pie says: "They are?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, I mean, heh, come on!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Of course they are!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's why I didn't bring you here to impress you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I wanted to make sure you had a chance to, heh, say "hello" to your old pal..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Spike!"
Maud Pie says: "Hello, Spike."
Pinkie Pie says: "Way to go, Maud!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Cross that off the to-do list!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Y'know what I'm sayin'?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Check!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Now, let's get moving, 'cause I'm about to show you something that'll make you yell "All right!"
Maud Pie says: "All right."
Pinkie Pie says: "See?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ha-ha!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ta-da!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's a castle..."
Pinkie Pie says: "made of rocks!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whaaaat?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Did I just blow your mind?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I think I just blew your mind."
Maud Pie says: "A lot of structures are made from rocks, Pinkie."
Maud Pie says: "They're a very stable building material."
Pinkie Pie says: "But this place grew out of nowhere after a magical key-build gem followed a rainbow and buried itself in the ground!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I mean, have you ever seen rocks like this?"
Maud Pie says: "Yes."
Pinkie Pie says: "No, you haven't!"
Maud Pie says: "We literally just saw hundreds of them in the gem cave."
Pinkie Pie says: "But..."
Pinkie Pie says: "but..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, look at those rocks!"
Maud Pie says: "Those are sting-bush seed pods."
Pinkie Pie says: "So they are!"
Pinkie Pie says: "But, uh..."
Pinkie Pie says: "look at that rock!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's even got four smaller rocks around it like legs!"
Maud Pie says: "That's a tortoise."
Pinkie Pie says: "Whose side are you on, Tank?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I guess you won't be moving to Ponyville after all."
Pinkie Pie says: "Those rocks at Ghastly Gorge don't know how lucky they are to have you."
Maud Pie says: "Actually, rocks aren't the only reason I'm considering Ponyville."
Pinkie Pie says: "You said it's a rock-based decision."
Maud Pie says: "I'm obviously passionate about exotic rocks, but I've always studied them..."
Maud Pie says: "alone."
Maud Pie says: "I could handle some less exciting rocks if it meant I'd have somepony to talk to besides Boulder."
Pinkie Pie says: "Are you saying you want..."
Pinkie Pie says: "a friend?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Maud Pie says: "I wouldn't mind one."
Maud Pie says: "It isn't hard to meet somepony I like."
Maud Pie says: "It's finding somepony who gets me."
Pinkie Pie says: "I get you."
Maud Pie says: "You're my sister."
Maud Pie says: "It's different."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud, you are the best!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You never know when the lightning of friendship will strike."
Pinkie Pie says: "Somepony could come barreling through that door at this very moment and become your best friend!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Y'know, I really thought somepony was gonna come barreling through that—"
Maud Pie says: "Uh."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Oh, my fault!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Totally my fault!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Are you okay?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I should've been watching where I was going, and—"
Starlight Glimmer says: "You look really familiar."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Have we met before?"
Maud Pie says: "Yes."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I knew it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whaaaaat?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "No, no, don't tell me."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Um..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Yeah."
Starlight Glimmer says: "See, I was really hoping you'd tell me while I pretended to remember."
Pinkie Pie says: "How is this possible?"
Maud Pie says: "I traveled Equestria for my rocktorate dissertation."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Psst!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Do you know a lot about rocks?"
Maud Pie says: "Yes."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Have you ever come across some kind of super-powerful stone that can store the cutie mark magic of..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I don't know..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "an entire village?"
Maud Pie says: "Yep."
Maud Pie says: "In the big cave."
Pinkie Pie says: "Tell nopony!"
Maud Pie says: "It's not like she's enslaved anypony lately."
Pinkie Pie says: "Offer to help."
Maud Pie says: "What?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Offer to help!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "You wanna help?"
Maud Pie says: "Do I?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Of course you do!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Go!"
Maud Pie says: "Okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "They're totally gonna be best friends and then Maud will choose Ponyville, and we'll get to wear BSFF slippers!"
Starlight's theme playing.
Maud Pie says: "Rocks take on different properties when interacting with magic."
Maud Pie says: "With the right stone, you could rule all of Equestria if you wanted to."
Starlight Glimmer says: "You're messing with me."
Maud Pie says: "Am I?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "So other than rocks, what else are you into?"
Maud Pie says: "Minerals."
Maud Pie says: "Plate tectonics."
Maud Pie says: "Oh, and stand-up comedy, of course."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I like..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "kites."
Maud Pie says: "Kites are cool."
Starlight Glimmer says: "The trick with an S."
Starlight Glimmer says: "L."
Starlight Glimmer says: "K."
Starlight Glimmer says: "is not to make the spars too heavy."
Starlight Glimmer says: "But if they're too light, you've got no ballast and then good luck tacking against the A."
Starlight Glimmer says: "O."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I."
Starlight Glimmer says: "!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I really like kites."
Maud Pie says: "They're starting to grow on me."
Pinkie Pie says: "Pizza delivery!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud and Starlight?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You're here too?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoa-ho-ho!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What a coincidence!"
Pinkie Pie says: "'Cause I was just, y'know, delivering this pizza to, um..."
Pinkie Pie says: "you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "So how's it going?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Uh, just hanging out—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You could use this time to bond and talk about feelings!"
Pinkie Pie says: "For example, do you feel like you're becoming friends?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Um..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I feel..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "like I don't want to talk about feelings?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Great!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'll go next."
Pinkie Pie says: "I feel like I love that you two are becoming best friends!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I mean, your friendship could be the friendship that makes Maud move to Ponyville!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No pressure, Starlight."
Pinkie Pie says: "Um, hello?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Where'd you two go?"
Maud Pie says: "Sorry about my sister."
Maud Pie says: "There's no half-excited with her."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Oh, I know."
Starlight Glimmer says: "But she always calms down."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Eventually."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Why do you find rocks so fascinating?"
Maud Pie says: "You don't look a day over six hundred."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Wow."
Starlight Glimmer says: "You can tell that from a line?"
Maud Pie says: "I didn't get a rocktorate because I can shred on guitar like nopony else."
Maud Pie says: "Another reason I like rocks – they don't exclude you if you're..."
Maud Pie says: "different than other ponies."
Starlight Glimmer says: "They're beautiful and strong, but they don't judge you or make you feel less than in any way."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I think I'm starting to like rocks, too."
Starlight Glimmer says: "It's hollow?"
Maud Pie says: "It's granite."
Maud Pie says: "Hollow granite is highly unusual."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Wow!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Have you ever seen anything like this?"
Maud Pie says: "No."
Maud Pie says: "And that's unusual."
Maud Pie says: "For me."
Pinkie Pie says: "There you are!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I thought you went your separate ways but you can't imagine how happy I am to find you both together and to witness one of your firsts as friends!"
Pinkie Pie says: "First time discovering an underground cavern!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I can't wait 'til you're old and eating pistachios together and telling your grand-foals about this!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, no!"
Pinkie Pie says: "They're not bonding!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I got an idea!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whooaa!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm tripping on a rock at this very moment!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And now I'm falling down!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, no!"
Pinkie Pie says: "My accidental clumsiness has trapped us here!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Where you'll be forced to bond until we're rescued."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Oh, we won't have to wait for that."
Starlight Glimmer says: "There's gotta be a spell that—"
Maud Pie says: "Get us out of here, boy."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Boulder, that was awesome!"
Maud Pie says: "No."
Maud Pie says: "That was sandstone."
Starlight Glimmer says: "More sand than stone, apparently."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm thinking you wear these around your neck at all times so I don't lose you again, you sillies!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That way, I can track your progress as friends!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And tomorrow, we can have a friendship brunch!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What's your favorite kind of omelette cupcake?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Mine's jalapeño red velvet!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Yeah, um, I-I don't know if I can make it."
Pinkie Pie says: "You'll change your minds when you smell the yummy food!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Come on!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Oops."
Pinkie Pie says: "Tomorrow's brunch is going to be the scrumptiest, brunchiest, munchiest brunch ever!"
Maud Pie says: "Yeah."
Maud Pie says: "About that..."
Pinkie Pie says: "The problem is, while you two were alone, I couldn't get data points on your friendship probabilities!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Were you making Starlight smile?"
Pinkie Pie says: "How was Starlight's smile-to-frown ratio?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Anything over five-to-one is great!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, and how many times did you smile like this?"
Maud Pie says: "Zero times."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, Maud, don't be so hard on yourself!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You've got the best friendship-maker in Ponyville on the case!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'll be by your side the whole time!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Speaking of which, your bell fell off, silly!"
Maud Pie says: "Pinkie Pie, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Buuuuuut?"
Maud Pie says: "Never mind."
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't worry, Maud."
Pinkie Pie says: "When you see this brunch, you'll realize everything's gonna be okay!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And then, I have amazing bonding activities planned for the next seventeen days!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You and Starlight will be besties in no time!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Goodnight!"
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Cupcake omelette..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Friendship brunch!"
Maud Pie says: "Pinkie Pie."
Maud Pie says: "Thank you for trying so hard to help me make friends."
Maud Pie says: "But my decision has to be rock based."
Maud Pie says: "And Ghastly Gorge has such great rocks, I won't even have time for friends."
Maud Pie says: "It's better this way."
Maud Pie says: "Sorry it didn't work out."
Maud Pie says: "Maud."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Starlight, wake up!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Kites!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Huh?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Oh."
Starlight Glimmer says: "If this is about brunch, I-I, uh..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "You know what?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Jalapeño red velvet omelettes sound gross."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I-I just can't."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud left in the middle of the night!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Oh."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I guess Ghastly Gorge really does have the best rocks."
Pinkie Pie says: "Why couldn't you two just be friends?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Pinkie Pie, I like Maud."
Pinkie Pie says: "You do?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Yeah."
Starlight Glimmer says: "She's weird!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "No, in a good way!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "She sees the world in a totally different way than anypony I've ever met."
Starlight Glimmer says: "She accepts me for who I am."
Starlight Glimmer says: "She taught me that a rock is never just a rock, and she could make anything funny."
Starlight Glimmer says: "We never had to say it, but we got each other."
Pinkie Pie says: "You really were becoming friends?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I think so, but you kinda sorta..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "got in the way."
Starlight Glimmer says: "You're right, too harsh."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Let's go with..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "You ruined everything all the time?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Mmmmh, that's worse."
Starlight Glimmer says: "What I'm trying to say is—"
Pinkie Pie says: "I have to go!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Ta-da..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Friendship lesson..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "learned?"
Maud Pie says: "Sigh."
Maud Pie says: "Emerald jasper?"
Maud Pie says: "This must be my lucky day."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud tracks!"
Maud Pie says: "Hello, Pinkie Pie."
Maud Pie says: "I found emerald jasper."
Pinkie Pie says: "Are you okay, Maud?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That eel almost ate you!"
Maud Pie says: "What eel?"
Maud Pie says: "You didn't need to come."
Maud Pie says: "I'm having a great time on my own."
Maud Pie says: "I even made a new friend."
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it a rock?"
Maud Pie says: "Yes."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud!"
Maud Pie says: "I don't belong in Ponyville."
Maud Pie says: "It only proved I'm better off all by myself."
Maud Pie says: "Like I always have been."
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't say that!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It was all my fault!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I—"
Pinkie Pie says: "I thought I knew everything about making friends, but I didn't even know my own sister!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I forced you to do things my way, but my way isn't your way!"
Maud Pie says: "This way."
Pinkie Pie says: "Exactly!"
Maud Pie says: "No."
Maud Pie says: "This way."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud, I thought you couldn't make a friend without my help, but it turns out you couldn't make a friend with my help."
Pinkie Pie says: "I underestimated you, and I'm sorry."
Maud Pie says: "I know you did it out of love."
Maud Pie says: "You're my best sister friend forever."
Maud Pie says: "And you melt my heart more easily than sodium-rich plagioclase feldspar."
Pinkie Pie says: "I don't know what that means, but please please please please please give Ponyville another chance!"
Pinkie Pie says: "But more importantly, give me another chance..."
Pinkie Pie says: "to leave you alone."
Maud Pie says: "What do you think, Boulder?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "You're back!"
Maud Pie says: "Mm-hmm."
Starlight Glimmer says: "For good?"
Maud Pie says: "Mm-hmm."
Maud Pie says: "This doesn't mean we need to start talking about feelings, does it?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Heh."
Starlight Glimmer says: "No way."
Maud Pie says: "Maybe after this we could decorate my new place."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Totally!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Where is it?"
Maud Pie says: "Well, it's not in Ponyville."
Maud Pie says: "More like Ponyville-adjacent."
Starlight Glimmer says: "It's perfect."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yes!"
Pinkie Pie says: "My sister's totally staying in Ponyville!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I mean Ponyville-adjacent!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Sorry, sorry, I'm leaving!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I promise."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm not even here."
Pinkie Pie says: "Aah, you're wearing the slippers!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay, now I'm really leaving."
Pinkie Pie says: "Buh-bye!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Heh-heh..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wrong way."
