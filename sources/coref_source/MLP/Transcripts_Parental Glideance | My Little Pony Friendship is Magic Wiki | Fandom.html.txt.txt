Apple Bloom says: "Scootaloo..."
Apple Bloom says: "is this such a..."
Apple Bloom says: "good idea?"
Scootaloo says: "What are you talking about?"
Scootaloo says: "This is the best idea I've ever had!"
Apple Bloom says: "It's just..."
Scootaloo says: "You wanna come."
Scootaloo says: "But we talked about this."
Scootaloo says: "Non-Pegasus ponies fall through the clouds."
Apple Bloom says: "Right, but..."
Sweetie Belle says: "I think we're good."
Apple Bloom says: "We are?"
Apple Bloom says: "Scootaloo, I know you have to go to Cloudsdale to finish your report."
Apple Bloom says: "I'm just wonderin' if this is the best way to get there."
Scootaloo says: "It'll be fine."
Scootaloo says: "Besides, how else could I get there?"
Apple Bloom says: "A Pegasus chariot?"
Sweetie Belle says: "A flock of birds?"
Apple Bloom says: "A hot-air balloon?"
Scootaloo says: "Huh."
Scootaloo says: "Those do seem a lot safer."
Scootaloo says: "Maybe I should try to find another waaaaaaaaayyyyyy!"
Scootaloo says: "Woo-hoo!"
Scootaloo says: "Nailed it."
Bow Hothoof says: "Uh, little ma'am, are you all right?"
Scootaloo says: "You're..."
Scootaloo says: "You're..."
Scootaloo says: "You're..."
Scootaloo says: "Rainbow Dash's dad!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Uh, yes."
Bow Hothoof says: "Bow Hothoof at your service."
Bow Hothoof says: "Uh, honey?"
Bow Hothoof says: "Somethin's goin' on out here!"
Windy Whistles says: "Oh!"
Windy Whistles says: "Heavens to Celestia, what's wrong with her?!"
Windy Whistles says: "!"
Bow Hothoof says: "I don't know, but you just made it worse."
Scootaloo says: "Sorry!"
Scootaloo says: "It's just you're..."
Scootaloo says: "Rainbow Dash's parents!"
Bow Hothoof says: "She's doing it again!"
Windy Whistles says: "Oh, dearie, please!"
Windy Whistles says: "You might shatter my Princess Celestia commemorative plates!"
Windy Whistles says: "Ow!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Our Rainbow Dash?"
Scootaloo says: "The report's on an inspirational pony in my life, and nopony inspires me more than she does!"
Scootaloo says: "I'm putting together this scrapbook for my report!"
Scootaloo says: "I'm her biggest fan!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Now, little trotter, what you say is impossible."
Bow Hothoof says: "Because nopony is a bigger fan of our Rainbow Dash than us!"
Scootaloo says: "Whoa!"
Scootaloo says: "You always wear that shirt?"
Bow Hothoof says: "Heh."
Bow Hothoof says: "Actually, it's, uh, laundry day."
Bow Hothoof says: "But pretty great, right?!"
Bow Hothoof says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "Yeah!"
Windy Whistles says: "My name's Windy Whistles, and I just have to say that it is a total blast to meet somepony that loves Rainbow Dash as much as we do!"
Bow Hothoof says: "What can we help you with?"
Scootaloo says: "Well, I know all about Rainbow Dash's time in Ponyville, but I don't know anything about her life before that."
Bow Hothoof says: "Well, you came to the right place!"
Windy Whistles says: "Here you go!"
Windy Whistles says: "Rainbow Dash's favorite meal!"
Windy Whistles says: "A pasta and potato sandwich on sourdough!"
Windy Whistles says: "She just loved to carbo-load."
Scootaloo says: "I can't believe I'm eating Rainbow Dash's favorite food made by Rainbow Dash's mom while sitting in Rainbow Dash's childhood kitchen!"
Scootaloo says: "This is the greatest day of my life!"
Scootaloo says: "Mmmm!"
Bow Hothoof says: "I think it's time for a tour of the house."
Scootaloo says: "Okay."
Bow Hothoof says: "Our little Dashie was an early learner and so rambunctious."
Bow Hothoof says: "The combination was—"
Windy Whistles says: "Exciting!"
Scootaloo says: "Whoa..."
Scootaloo says: "Is that..."
Scootaloo says: "her room?"
Scootaloo says: ""When the going gets tough, the tough don't notice because they have hard shells."
Scootaloo says: "" That's so Rainbow Dash!"
Scootaloo says: "Woo-hoo!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Scootaloo, wanna see something really cool?"
Bow Hothoof says: "I, uh, installed the sound effects myself."
Bow Hothoof says: "Pretty great, huh?"
Scootaloo says: "So great!"
Windy Whistles says: "And look at this!"
Windy Whistles says: "She was wearing it when she spoke her first words."
Scootaloo says: "So cool!"
Windy Whistles says: "And this broken lantern is from when she first learned to fly."
Windy Whistles says: "And this bitten apple is from when she grew her first tooth!"
Windy Whistles says: "So many memories!"
Scootaloo says: "You're so lucky to have all of these!"
Windy Whistles says: "Well, I may have a ton of Dash-mentos, but I don't have any of those "Rainbow Dash Saves Ponyville" headlines like you."
Scootaloo says: "Trade-sies?"
Windy Whistles says: "Deal-sies!"
Scootaloo says: "So where's all the Wonderbolt stuff?"
Bow Hothoof says: "You mean Rainbow Dash's personal collection of Wonderbolt memorabilia?"
Scootaloo says: "No."
Scootaloo says: "I mean, where's all the stuff about Rainbow Dash getting accepted into the Wonderbolt Academy and then getting chosen as a Wonderbolt?"
Scootaloo says: "Wait, you don't know that your daughter's a Wonderbolt?"
Scootaloo says: "And I got to tell you?!"
Scootaloo says: "!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Uhhhhhhhhh..."
Windy Whistles says: "Uhhhhhhhhh..."
Scootaloo says: "Oh, wow!"
Scootaloo says: "You should see your faces right now!"
Scootaloo says: "See?"
Scootaloo says: "That's what your faces look like."
Bow Hothoof says: "Our daughter's a Wonderbolt?!"
Windy Whistles says: "Our daughter's a Wonderbolt?!"
Bow Hothoof says: "!"
Windy Whistles says: "!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Great timing."
Scootaloo says: "Great door."
Windy Whistles says: "I just..."
Windy Whistles says: "It's..."
Windy Whistles says: "Unbelievable!"
Scootaloo says: "You two were kind enough to show me the Rainbow Dash you know."
Scootaloo says: "Now please, allow me to show you the Rainbow Dash I know."
Wonderbolts' theme playing.
Spitfire says: "Let's make some thunder!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I was born to make thunder!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Our baby's a Wonderbolt!"
Spitfire says: "We've got turbulence!"
Rainbow Dash says: "How?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Where's it coming from?"
Bow Hothoof says: "I'm so proud!"
Misty Fly says: "There!"
Bow Hothoof says: "She's a Wonderbolt!"
Windy Whistles says: "She's a Wonderbolt!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, no."
Spitfire says: "Okay."
Spitfire says: "Which pony broke protocol and invited guests to our training exercises?!"
Spitfire says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I guess they're with me."
Rainbow Dash says: "Mom, Dad."
Rainbow Dash says: "So..."
Rainbow Dash says: "good..."
Rainbow Dash says: "to see you."
Windy Whistles says: "Oh, honey, it's so great to see you, too!"
Windy Whistles says: "And wow!"
Windy Whistles says: "You were so amazing up there with all of that flying!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, how did you know I was here?"
Windy Whistles says: "Scootaloo filled us in on everything, you modest pony you!"
Scootaloo says: "I can't believe I'm documenting the moment your parents first saw you as a Wonderbolt!"
Windy Whistles says: "And these must be your Wonderbolt friends!"
Windy Whistles says: "Hello, team!"
Windy Whistles says: "I'm Windy Whistles, the mom of the best Wonderbolt ever!"
Windy Whistles says: "Yeah!"
Windy Whistles says: "Just kidding."
Windy Whistles says: "You guys were great, too!"
Windy Whistles says: "Go, team!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Moooom!"
Spitfire says: "Hello, ma'am."
Spitfire says: "Nice to meet you."
Windy Whistles says: "Nice to meet you as well, and love those goggles!"
Windy Whistles says: "Love 'em!"
Windy Whistles says: "You know, I have goggles, too."
Windy Whistles says: "But they're mostly just for swimming."
Windy Whistles says: "Oh, and bath time."
Rainbow Dash says: "Mom, please!"
Rainbow Dash says: "They don't wanna hear about your bath time!"
Bow Hothoof says: "I can't believe it!"
Bow Hothoof says: "My daughter, a Wonderbolt!"
Bow Hothoof says: "So proud!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Dad, hold it together."
Rainbow Dash says: "We're in public."
Bow Hothoof says: "I know!"
Bow Hothoof says: "I know, i—"
Bow Hothoof says: "but it's..."
Bow Hothoof says: "just..."
Bow Hothoof says: "You had a goal, and..."
Bow Hothoof says: "you achieved it!"
Spitfire says: "All right, Wonderbolts!"
Spitfire says: "Let's hit the showers and give Rainbow Dash some time to spend with her family."
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay, yeah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, great practice!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'll, uh, eh, catch up with you guys in a minute!"
Fleetfoot says: "Sir, you really raised a great flyer!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Oh, no!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Tears..."
Bow Hothoof says: "welling up again!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Dad!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Could you give us a sec?"
Scootaloo says: "Is something wrong?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah."
Rainbow Dash says: "You should've warned me that you were bringing my parents!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Or talked to Twilight or something!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Not just shown up!"
Scootaloo says: "Why?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "It's just my parents and I have a delicate relationship."
Rainbow Dash says: "I love them very much, and we're really close, but there's a reason I didn't tell them I'm a Wonderbolt!"
Rainbow Dash says: "They can be a little bit..."
Rainbow Dash says: "embarrassing."
Scootaloo says: "Huh?"
Scootaloo says: "Really?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, really!"
Rainbow Dash says: "And now you've invited a whole lot of crazy into my life!"
Scootaloo says: "What's wrong with a little support?"
Scootaloo says: "Bow and Windy, I'd like you to meet Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle."
Apple Bloom says: "Hi!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Hello."
Bow Hothoof says: "Greetings, small ponies."
Apple Bloom says: "Are you excited to see Rainbow Dash?"
Windy Whistles says: "Oh, my, yes!"
Windy Whistles says: "And to think we never bothered to come to a Wonderbolt event!"
Bow Hothoof says: "We said if Rainbow Dash isn't a Wonderbolt, then what's the point?"
Bow Hothoof says: "But now, she is!"
Scootaloo says: "And she earned it!"
Scootaloo says: "Did you know it all started when she won a spot in the coveted Wonderbolts Academy, training under Spitfire?"
Windy Whistles says: "I didn't know that!"
Windy Whistles says: "How wonderful!"
Scootaloo says: "But then, she had some heavy competition."
Scootaloo says: "Especially against another Pegasus named Lightning Dust."
Windy Whistles says: "Oh, no!"
Scootaloo says: "But, of course, Rainbow Dash proved to be the best and later made it into the Wonderbolt Reserves!"
Windy Whistles says: "Hooray again!"
Scootaloo says: "But jealous ex-Wonderbolt Wind Rider was worried that Rainbow Dash might break his speed record."
Scootaloo says: "And so, he framed her for a crime she didn't commit."
Windy Whistles says: "Oh, no!"
Scootaloo says: "But thanks to Rarity, Rainbow Dash proved her innocence and became a backup Wonderbolt until Fire Streak retired, and she became an official Wonderbolt!"
Windy Whistles says: "Hooray!"
Windy Whistles says: "Wow, what a gripping tale!"
Bow Hothoof says: "You really know your Rainbow Dash history."
Bow Hothoof says: "You're going to do great on your report."
Apple Bloom says: "Show's about to start."
Wonderbolts' theme playing.
Bow Hothoof says: "Come on, Bolts!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Let's start this thing!"
Windy Whistles says: "Wonderbolts' Big Showcase!"
Windy Whistles says: "Here!"
Windy Whistles says: "We!"
Windy Whistles says: "Gooooooooo!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Rip it up and tear!"
Bow Hothoof says: "It!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Down!"
Windy Whistles says: "Then build it back up again and tear it back down again!"
Windy Whistles says: "Yeah!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Woo!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Yeah!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Uh-huh, uh-huh!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Go go go!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Yes!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Go, Rainbow Dash!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Best Wonderbolt ever!"
Windy Whistles says: "Woo-hoo!"
Windy Whistles says: "That's my daughter!"
Windy Whistles says: "Go, Rainbow!"
Windy Whistles says: "Go, Dashie, go-go-go-go-go!"
Windy Whistles says: "You go, girl!"
Fleetfoot says: "Your folks were definitely loud, but they weren't that bad."
Spitfire says: "Whoa!"
Spitfire says: "Since when did we add fireworks to the show?!"
Spitfire says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uhhhh, we didn't."
Attagirl!
Yeah!
Go-go-go-go-go!
Woo-hoo!
Go, girl! Go, girl, you got it!
You're a Wonderbolt!
Fleetfoot says: "Wow..."
Bow Hothoof says: "Go, Rainbow Dash!"
Bow Hothoof says: "You sign that photo!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Whoo!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Cut the ribbon!"
Windy Whistles says: "Cut the ribbon!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Cut the ribbon!"
Windy Whistles says: "Cut the ribbon!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Cut the ribbon!"
Windy Whistles says: "Cut the ribbon!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Cut the ribbon!"
Windy Whistles says: "Cut the ribbon!"
Bow Hothoof says: "The camera loves you!"
Windy Whistles says: "The camera loves you!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Yeah!"
Windy Whistles says: "Yeah!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Now, let's do the pyramid!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Scootaloo, get up there!"
Bow Hothoof says: "You're the top!"
Spitfire says: "You really do got yourself your very own mega-fans."
Spitfire says: "Lucky you."
Windy Whistles says: "You hung that towel!"
Windy Whistles says: "Yeah!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Greatest towel hanger of all time!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Towel!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Towel!"
Windy Whistles says: "Towel!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Towel!"
Windy Whistles says: "Towel!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Towel!"
Windy Whistles says: "Towel!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Towel!"
Windy Whistles says: "Towel!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Towel!"
Windy Whistles says: "Towel!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Towel!"
Windy Whistles says: "Towel!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Towel!"
Windy Whistles says: "Towel!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Tow—"
Windy Whistles says: "Tow—"
Rainbow Dash says: "Stop!"
Rainbow Dash says: "This is ridiculous!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Mom and Dad, you are both too supportive!"
Rainbow Dash says: "This is exactly why I didn't tell you I was a Wonderbolt!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You're just..."
Rainbow Dash says: "too much!"
Windy Whistles says: "Did..."
Windy Whistles says: "Did we do something wrong?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yes!"
Rainbow Dash says: "The fireworks, the cheerleading, and-and how do you even compare who is better or worse at hanging up a towel?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Bow Hothoof says: "We're just trying to be supportive."
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, I'm tired of it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I've had enough of you two being so proud of every little ridiculous, insignificant thing I do!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I think you should leave."
Windy Whistles says: "First of all, great job yelling at us, sweetie."
Windy Whistles says: "No one  can make their parents feel more worthless than you!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Your words were direct, clear, and..."
Bow Hothoof says: "so painful!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Is there nothing you can't do?!"
Bow Hothoof says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "Why?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Scootaloo, you don't understand!"
Scootaloo says: "I met your parents hoping to learn more about you, but I don't like what I found out!"
Scootaloo says: "I'll find somepony else to do my hero report on."
Rainbow Dash says: "Scootaloo, wait!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I know I wasn't myself back there, and I shouldn't have snapped at my parents!"
Rainbow Dash says: "That's exactly why I didn't tell them I'm a Wonderbolt!"
Scootaloo says: "I don't understand."
Scootaloo says: "They're so proud of you."
Rainbow Dash says: "Can I tell you something?"
Scootaloo says: "Sure."
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay, but you might wanna hold onto your wings because this could rock you to your very core."
Rainbow Dash says: "Believe it or not, there was a time when I wasn't the best at everything."
Rainbow Dash says: "See this picture?"
Rainbow Dash says: "It looks like I won something awesome, but actually..."
Announcer says: "And last, but not least, it's time to hand out our participant stickers!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Yeeeeeeeaaaaahhhhh!"
Windy Whistles says: "Yeeeeeeeaaaaahhhhh!"
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah, Rainbow Dash!
You show 'em!
Go, Rainbow! Go, Rainbow!
Hooray!
Yeah!
Bow Hothoof says: "Greatest participant ever!"
Young "Dumb-Bell" says: "Uh, your parents realize you didn't win, don't they?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Granted, I was the youngest pony in the senior competitive circuit."
Rainbow Dash says: "Most other ponies my age were still in the Junior Flappers' Club."
Rainbow Dash says: "I thought it was utterly mortifying having my parents cheer me on even when I lost!"
Rainbow Dash says: "But then, when I started to win competitions – which didn't take very long, by the way – things got even worse!"
Yeah!
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah, Rainbow Dash, you show 'em!
Whoo!
Go, Rainbow! Go, Rainbow!
Woo-hoo-hooo! Yeah!
Rainbow Dash says: "Being the best came with consequences."
Rainbow Dash says: "Very loud, very embarrassing consequences."
Scootaloo says: "Ya know, some ponies would dream of having parents like that."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, right!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Name one!"
Scootaloo says: "Me."
Scootaloo says: "Growing up, I never thought I'd be the best at anything, because nopony ever told me."
Scootaloo says: "But your parents told you over and over again."
Scootaloo says: "Look!"
Scootaloo says: "Best bath taker ever."
Scootaloo says: "Best carrot eater under three."
Scootaloo says: "Greatest napper of all time!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh?"
Scootaloo says: "For your entire life, your parents gave you the confidence to believe in yourself."
Rainbow Dash says: "You're right."
Rainbow Dash says: "I was always so embarrassed by my parents that I didn't realize their support actually made me the awesome, confident, amazing, awesome, and awesome pony I am!"
Rainbow Dash says: "And I took them for granted."
Scootaloo says: "And you yelled at them."
Rainbow Dash says: "I gotta make this right."
Rainbow Dash says: "I have an idea, but I'm gonna need your help."
Rainbow Dash says: "That is, if you're willing to help me after I acted like that."
Scootaloo says: "Now, that's a great picture!"
Scootaloo says: ""Rainbow Dash learns the error of her ways"!"
Windy Whistles says: "I'm telling you, I just can't see a thing."
Windy Whistles says: "Scootaloo, you are just so great at blindfolds!"
Bow Hothoof says: "It's true."
Bow Hothoof says: "You must tell me what kind of knot you used."
Bow Hothoof says: "Uh, falconer's knot?"
Bow Hothoof says: "Wait, no!"
Bow Hothoof says: "A farmer's loop!"
Windy Whistles says: "What's this all about, anywho?"
Rainbow Dash says: "event."
Rainbow Dash says: "Enjoy!"
Wonderbolts' theme music.
Rainbow Dash says: "Thanks for doing this."

Bow Hothoof says: "Ahhh..."
Windy Whistles says: "Ahhh..."
Bow Hothoof says: "Oh!"
Windy Whistles says: "Oh!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Ooh!"
Windy Whistles says: "Ooh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Mom and Dad, I want you to know that I'm your biggest fan."
Windy Whistles says: "Oh, honey, thank you."
Windy Whistles says: "But you didn't have to do all this."
Windy Whistles says: "It's kind of  embarrassing."
Bow Hothoof says: "Eh, it is a bit much."
Scootaloo says: "And that's why Rainbow Dash is the most inspirational pony in my life!"
Cheerilee says: "Thank you, Scootaloo."
Cheerilee says: "Very well researched!"
Cheerilee says: "But a little heavy on the pictures, and there was a moldy sandwich in your report."
Cheerilee says: "Um, I'll give you a B."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Greatest report giver of all time!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Scootaloo!"
Windy Whistles says: "Scootaloo!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Scootaloo!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Scootaloo!"
Windy Whistles says: "Scootaloo!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Scootaloo!"
Bow Hothoof says: "Scootaloo!"
Windy Whistles says: "Scootaloo!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Scootaloo!"
Scootaloo!
Scootaloo!
Scootaloo!
Scootaloo!
Scootaloo!
Scootaloo!
Keep it down!
Okay!
This isn't a rock-and-roll concert!
Please!
