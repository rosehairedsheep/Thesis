Rarity says: "Ahh, and, the smell of..."
Rarity says: "smoke..."
Rarity says: "smoke?"
Rarity says: "Smoke?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "SMOO—"
Rarity says: "AAH!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Rarity!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Rrgh, you ruined the surprise!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I was gonna serve you breakfast in bed!"
Hondo Flanks says: "Well!"
Hondo Flanks says: "G'mornin', Rarity!"
Rarity says: "Father!"
Rarity says: "Mother!"
Hondo Flanks says: "I'll have you know that Sweetie Belle here cooked this yummy lookin' breakfast all on her own."
Rarity says: "I..."
Rarity says: "figured."
Rarity says: "I didn't know you could burn juice."
Cookie Crumbles says: "I've been giving her lessons."
Cookie Crumbles says: "I wouldn't be surprised if she's got a cutie mark in fancy cooking by the time we get back from our vacation."
Rarity says: "Vacation?"
Rarity says: "Is that this week?"
Rarity says: "As in 'starting this very instant' this week?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "Uurh."
Rarity says: "Let me guess: apple sauce?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Nope."
Sweetie Belle says: "Toast!"
Sweetie Belle says: "We're gonna have the bestest time two sisters could ever have!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I'm gonna go grab my stuff from Dad's wagon."
Rarity says: "So, now, when you say 'a week'..."
Rarity says: "is that, um, seven whole days?"
Cookie Crumbles says: "And six nights, I know!"
Cookie Crumbles says: "Such a short time to spend with your little sis."
Hondo Flanks says: "You gonna eat that?"
Rarity says: "But I've got such a long to-do list."
Rarity says: "Oh well, I suppose 'spend time with your sister' will just have to be added to the list."
Sweetie Belle says: "Just a few necessities."
Rarity says: "Now, let's get that kitchen all cleaned up."
Sweetie Belle says: "Cleaned up?"
Sweetie Belle says: "But we haven't even eaten yet."
Rarity says: "Well now, Sweetie Belle, I appreciate the gesture, but we simply can't eat this breakfast; it's burnt."
Sweetie Belle says: "It's not that burnt."
Rarity says: "Never fear, my dear, I'll get a proper breakfast going."
Sweetie Belle says: "Can I help?"
Rarity says: "Oh, er, of course, er, in one moment, Sweetie Belle."
Rarity says: "Let me just get things started."
Sweetie Belle says: "Rarity!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I thought you said I was gonna help!"
Rarity says: "You are!"
Rarity says: "You..."
Rarity says: "can..."
Rarity says: "put the garnish on the plates."
Sweetie Belle says: "You mean this parsley?"
Rarity says: "Okay, now, easy!"
Rarity says: "It has to be just right!"
Rarity says: "No need to rush."
Rarity says: "No!"
Rarity says: "That's too slow."
Rarity says: "Careful!"
Rarity says: "Back up!"
Rarity says: "Looking for perfection here..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Whoa, whoa!"
Rarity says: "Not..."
Rarity says: "bad."
Rarity says: "There are some things I must attend to."
Rarity says: "Can you take the dirty towels to the laundry room?"
Sweetie Belle says: "No problem, I'll make myself useful!"
Rarity says: "Sweetie Belle!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I told you I'd make myself useful."
Sweetie Belle says: "Surprised?"
Rarity says: "Am I?"
Rarity says: "You washed my incredibly expensive one-of-a-kind designer crocheted wool sweater!"
Rarity says: "Do you know how hard these things are to come by?"
Sweetie Belle says: "What's the big deal?"
Rarity says: "The big deal is that in the heat of the sun, wool..."
Rarity says: "shrinks."
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh."
Sweetie Belle says: "Sorry."
Rarity says: "Nng..."
Rarity says: "Well."
Rarity says: "Back to work."
Rarity says: "I must create!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Sorry?"
Rarity says: "Huh."
Rarity says: "Stay out of trouble, okay?"
Rarity says: "Please?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I just wanted to do something nice for my sister."
Sweetie Belle says: "Raargh, I'm so bored!"
Sweetie Belle says: "When is Rarity gonna finish her work?"
Rarity says: "Stay out of trouble, okay?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I never got in trouble for drawing."
Sweetie Belle says: "Hmm."
Sweetie Belle says: "This needs something..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Hi, Rarity!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I made a special drawing for y—"
Rarity says: "Oh no!"
Rarity says: "Did you use these gems?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, yes, but I know you have more in your work room—"
Rarity says: "But, but these are extremely rare baby blue sapphires!"
Rarity says: "I need them for an outfit for an extremely important client!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh."
Sweetie Belle says: "Sorry."
Rarity says: "Sweetie Belle, what am I going to do with you?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh!"
Sweetie Belle says: "We could paint together, we could ride bikes, play chess, sing a song, catch frogs, pillow fight—"
Rarity says: "That's not what I meant!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh."
Rarity says: "Now I have to go and find some more of these gems!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I'll go with you and help!"
Rarity says: "No!"
Rarity says: "No thank you."
Rarity says: "You can help by picking up these papers and stacking them, neatly."
Rarity says: "Put the pens and pencils back exactly where you found them, and please find something to do that doesn't create a large mess for me to clean up!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Geez Louise, can't I do anything right?"
Rarity says: "Sweetie Belle!"
Rarity says: "I'm back!"
Rarity says: "Sweetie Belle?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Surprise!"
Rarity says: "My—"
Rarity says: "ee—"
Rarity says: "bleh—"
Rarity says: "My inspiration room!"
Rarity says: "What did you do?"
Rarity says: "What did you do?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Sweetie Belle says: "When I saw the big mess in your room, I thought I'd clean it up for you."
Rarity says: "This wasn't a mess!"
Rarity says: "It was organized chaos!"
Rarity says: "I was just about finished planning my new fashion line, and, and you, you, you went and, and you—"
Rarity says: "and you put everything away!"
Sweetie Belle says: "But every time I make a mess, you get upset!"
Rarity says: "But this was my mess in my house!"
Rarity says: "And now I have to start from scratch!"
Sweetie Belle says: "But, I thought it would make you happy!"
Rarity says: "Happy?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "Happy?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "I—"
Rarity says: "I just need some time alone."
Rarity says: "Hm!"
Apple Bloom says: "How's the sleepover at Rarity's goin'?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Why, it's smashing!"
Apple Bloom says: "Huh?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I just wish we could do something special together that didn't include me goofing anything up."
Apple Bloom says: "The Sisterhooves Social!"
Apple Bloom says: "Applejack an' I do it every year!"
Apple Bloom says: "You an' Rarity can compete against other sister teams in all these neat events!"
Sweetie Belle says: "That sounds like the perfect way for us to hang out!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Rarity will think it's an excellent idea."
Rarity says: "What a ridiculous idea."
Rarity says: "A contest at Sweet Apple Acres?"
Rarity says: "It doesn't sound..."
Rarity says: "very..."
Rarity says: "clean."
Sweetie Belle says: "So, what, now you're back to hating messes?"
Rarity says: "Sweetie Belle, watch your tone!"
Rarity says: "I am still your big sister."
Sweetie Belle says: "Right!"
Sweetie Belle says: "And any sister who cares about her sister goes!"
Rarity says: "Sweetie Belle..."
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "Honestly!"
Rarity says: "Playing silly little games in the dirt is just..."
Rarity says: "uncouth!"
Rarity says: "With or without a sister."
Sweetie Belle says: "Well then!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Maybe, maybe I'll try the Sisterhooves Social without a sister!"
Sweetie Belle says: "In fact, I think I'll try the rest of my life without a sister!"
Rarity says: "Oh, I'm the one who's ruining your life?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "Really?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "Have you looked around this place?"
Rarity says: "I'm the one who'd be better off with no sister!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Well it looks like we finally agree on something!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Neither of us needs a sister!"
Rarity says: "Deal!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Deal!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Goodbye, un-sister!"
Rarity says: "Hmph!"
Applejack says: "'Uncouth'?"
Applejack says: "She said the Sisterhooves Social was 'uncouth'?"
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah!"
Apple Bloom says: "Uncouth?"
Apple Bloom says: "Wait."
Apple Bloom says: "What's uncouth?"
Sweetie Belle says: "It's not just the Social."
Sweetie Belle says: "She thinks I'm uncouth."
Applejack says: "Honey, Rarity thinks everything's uncouth."
Apple Bloom says: "What's uncouth?"
Applejack says: "It means uncivil."
Applejack says: "Y'know, bad mannered?"
Applejack says: "Exactly."
Applejack says: "Sweetie Belle, just give Rarity some time."
Applejack says: "She'll come around."
Applejack says: "Sisters always do."
Sweetie Belle says: "Not sisters like Rarity."
Applejack says: "Come on, now."
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom and I got some chores to finish up on."
Applejack says: "Maybe you can help!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You sure you want me to help?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I just mess everything up!"
Applejack says: "Oh, come on, that's just stinkin' thinkin'."
Applejack says: "Watch!"
Applejack says: "Good catch there, Apple Bloom!"
Applejack says: "Whoo!"
Sweetie Belle says: "This is a chore?"
Applejack says: "Since we can't sell the bruised apples, we gotta collect them all for the pigs to eat."
Apple Bloom says: "It's a lot of work, so we make a game of it."
Apple Bloom says: "Wanna try?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Um, okay."
Sweetie Belle says: "Ow!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You're right, it is hard work."
Apple Bloom says: "That's why we do it..."
Applejack says: "Together!"
Apple Bloom says: "Together!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Huh, Rarity never wants to do chores together."
Rarity says: "Ugh, all that work ruined, thanks to Sweetie Belle."
Rarity says: "Oh my."
Rarity says: "It's usually a big mess in here."
Rarity says: "Well, no matter."
Rarity says: "She still shouldn't have touched my things without permission."
Rarity says: "Hm!"
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom!"
Applejack says: "You're up!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You're..."
Sweetie Belle says: "making..."
Sweetie Belle says: "grape juice?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Rarity would call the fashion police on me if I got grape juice anywhere near her precious outfits."
Apple Bloom says: "Well, that's silly!"
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Please, Applejack, she didn't mean—"
Apple Bloom says: "Whoa!"
Applejack says: "How d'you like them grapes, y'little whippersnapper!"
Apple Bloom says: "That tickles!"
Rarity says: "Now to get these fabrics washed for my fabulous new line."
Rarity says: "Ooh, my favorite sweater..."
Rarity says: "I just can't believe that Sweetie Belle."
Rarity says: "Oh, Opal-wopal!"
Rarity says: "It's as if Sweetie Belle knew the sweater was perfect for you."
Rarity says: "And Sweetie Belle should consider herself perfectly lucky that this thoughtless mishap turned out all right."
Rarity says: "Hm."
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom!"
Apple Bloom says: "Got it, sis!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Wow."
Sweetie Belle says: "It's as if they were just one pony."
Applejack says: "Yee-haw!"
Apple Bloom says: "Yee-haw!"
Applejack says: "Way to corral some critters, sis!"
Sheep says: "You coulda just a-a-a-asked."
Sweetie Belle says: "Rarity never high-hoofs me."
Rarity says: "Perfect!"
Rarity says: "Just one more, and this ensemble is fini!"
Rarity says: "Rrgh, Sweetie Belle!"
Rarity says: "Where's her silly little arts and crafts project?"
Rarity says: "Oh, Sweetie Belle!"
Rarity says: "My one and only sister!"
Rarity says: "What have I done?"
Rarity says: "All the time I could have spent with you was wasted complaining and wishing you were gone!"
Rarity says: "Woe is me!"
Rarity says: "No!"
Rarity says: "I must get her back!"
Rarity says: "I must!"
Rarity says: "As Celestia is my witness, I shall never be sisterless again!"
Rarity says: "Sweetie Belle!"
Rarity says: "Oh, I have been galloping all over looking for you."
Rarity says: "I—"
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh hello, un-sister."
Sweetie Belle says: "What are you doing here?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Better be careful, you might get some dust on you."
Rarity says: "Oh, Sweetie Belle, I want to apologize."
Rarity says: "I am not better off without a sister."
Sweetie Belle says: "I'm not better off without a sister either."
Sweetie Belle says: "Spending the day with Applejack and Apple Bloom made me realize that."
Rarity says: "Oh, Sweetie, you don't know how happy I am to hear—"
Sweetie Belle says: "And that's why I'm adopting Applejack as my big sister!"
Rarity says: "What?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Applejack says: "What?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "What?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Sweetie Belle says: "A sister is someone who loves and takes care of another sister."
Sweetie Belle says: "Applejack's a real sister."
Applejack says: "H-Hold on, Sweetie Belle."
Applejack says: "Don't get ahead of yourself here."
Apple Bloom says: "Besides, she's my big sister!"
Applejack says: "Yeah, um—"
Sweetie Belle says: "Or maybe she should be your sister, so she could teach you what a good sister is supposed to be!"
Applejack says: "Heh, um, actually, I—"
Rarity says: "But I don't need lessons on being a good sister, I-I promise!"
Rarity says: "Listen!"
Rarity says: "I'll show you how to cook my favorite quiche!"
Rarity says: "Or, or, I'll show you the proper way to beautify your mane."
Rarity says: "Won't that be fun?"
Rarity says: "Hm?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Hm!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You want me to go home with you, so we can do what you wanna do?"
Rarity says: "Uh..."
Rarity says: "yes?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Just forget it!"
Apple Bloom says: "We're still sisters, right?"
Rarity says: "Well, that apology went swimmingly."
Rarity says: "Applejack, why do you have to be so good and make me look so bad?"
Applejack says: "Oh Rarity, once again you're thinkin' about yourself."
Applejack says: "Bein' sisters is a give and take."
Applejack says: "You've been doin' a whole lotta takin', but you haven't been doin' a whole lotta givin'."
Rarity says: "But of course I give."
Rarity says: "I give lessons."
Rarity says: "Reasonable demands."
Applejack says: "But ya never give in."
Applejack says: "Bein' sisters is like..."
Applejack says: "apple pie."
Applejack says: "You can have amazin' apples, and you can have a wonderfully crispy crust, but only together you can have a perfect apple pie."
Rarity says: "But apart, all we are is just a pile of mush and some crumbly dry mess..."
Rarity says: "I know what I need to do!"
Rarity says: "I just hope it isn't too late!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, I guess it's a good thing Rarity isn't here."
Sweetie Belle says: "Do I see 'uncouth' written all over this contest?"
Apple Bloom says: "Look at the size of that pig!"
Applejack says: "He sure is a cutie."
Sweetie Belle says: "That's the last word Rarity would use."
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh my, what a repulsive monstrosity!"
Sweetie Belle says: "This thing needs a head to toe makeover!"
Applejack says: "It's almost time!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, you two have fun."
Sweetie Belle says: "Sure wish I had a sister to run the race with."
Sweetie Belle says: "Huh?"
Apple Bloom says: "You do now!"
Applejack says: "AB and I figured since we do this every year..."
Apple Bloom says: "I'd let you borrow my sis so you can give it a try!"
Applejack says: "Sister for a day."
Sweetie Belle says: "No way!"
Apple Bloom says: "One."
Apple Bloom says: "Day."
Apple Bloom says: "One."
Apple Bloom says: "Day."
Granny Smith says: "Is this thing on?"
Granny Smith says: "That's what I said."
Sweetie Belle says: "That's us."
Apple Bloom says: "One."
Apple Bloom says: "Day."
Apple Bloom says: "Good luck!"
Granny Smith says: "And may the best sisters win!"
Granny Smith says: "On your marks..."
Granny Smith says: "get set..."
Granny Smith says: "Gooooo!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You okay, Applejack?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Applejack, help!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You can do it, sister!"
Apple Bloom says: "Ooh, so close!"
Apple Bloom says: "You almost won!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Thank you, Applejack!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You were amazing!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I don't even care that we didn't win."
Sweetie Belle says: "This was so much fun!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Huh?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Rarity?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Wait, where's Applejack?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I don't get it."
Applejack says: "We switched places over at the very first mudhole."
Sweetie Belle says: "So, we did the whole competition..."
Sweetie Belle says: "together?"
Rarity says: "That we did, little sister."
Rarity says: "Well, except for the start line."
Apple Bloom says: "But you finished together!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You mean..."
Sweetie Belle says: "you were all in on it?"
Applejack says: "Mm-hmm."
Apple Bloom says: "Mm-hmm."
Rarity says: "Mm-hmm."
Sweetie Belle says: "You did this for me?"
Rarity says: "Us."
Rarity says: "I did it for us."
Rarity says: "You see?"
Rarity says: "We are apple pie!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Huh?"
Rarity says: "Uh, I'll explain later."
Rarity says: "For now, I think we deserve a celebration!"
Applejack says: "Yeah!"
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Yeah!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Where?"
Rarity says: "The spa, of course."
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh, Rarity."
Rarity says: "No, I-I-I'm serious."
Rarity says: "Very well then, what should we write to the Princess?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I'll start."
Sweetie Belle says: "Having a sister is just about the bestest thing in the world."
Sweetie Belle says: "But it sure isn't the easiest."
Rarity says: "I agree that being sisters is a wonderful thing, but it takes teamwork."
Rarity says: "Sometimes it's about compromising."
Rarity says: "Sometimes it's about accepting each others' differences."
Rarity says: "But mostly, it's about having fun together."
Rarity says: "Even if it means getting your hooves a little bit dirty."
Sweetie Belle says: "A lot dirty."
Rarity says: "A little bit dirty."
Sweetie Belle says: "A lot dirty."
Rarity says: "A little bit dirty!"
Sweetie Belle says: "A lo—"
Spike says: "Hold it, hold it!"
Spike says: "How about "a medium amount of dirty, not too little, not too much, just right"?"
Rarity says: "Deal!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Deal!"
