Sweetie Belle says: "Hey, Apple Bloom!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Rarity's reorganizing her shop, and look what she found!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Old costumes from the talent show!"
Scootaloo says: "We thought they'd come in handy in case we ever help a pony put on a play or need to make a quick escape disguised as clowns."
Apple Bloom says: "Here ya go, Big Mac."
Scootaloo says: "Whoa, that sure is a lot of apples!"
Apple Bloom says: "Are you makin' another delivery to Starlight's old village?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Sweetie Belle says: "That's an awful long way for a pony to go, isn't it?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Apple Bloom says: "You've been goin' there a lot lately."
Apple Bloom says: "What is this, your fifth trip this week?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Apple Bloom says: "Okay, well, have fun."
Apple Bloom says: "So what other costumes did you bring, Sweetie Belle?"
Scootaloo says: "Are you crazy?!"
Scootaloo says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "We can't talk about costumes at a time like this!"
Apple Bloom says: "Time like what?"
Scootaloo says: "Your brother is hiding something."
Scootaloo says: "Did you see the way he was acting?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Yeah."
Sweetie Belle says: "He totally blushed when you brought up how often he's been going to Starlight's old village."
Scootaloo says: "Something is definitely going on."
Scootaloo says: "There can be only be one reason a pony would travel so far, so often."
He's taking private skiing lessons!
He's training for a marathon!
I've been cooking a lot of broccoli...
Apple Bloom says: "..."
Apple Bloom says: "and he wants to get away from the smell!"
Scootaloo says: "Maybe he's a spy on a mission to thwart an evil villain with a secret weapon: an apple cannon!"
Apple Bloom says: "No, that's crazy!"
Apple Bloom says: "I think it's my broccoli thing."
Sweetie Belle says: "Why don't we just ask him?"
Scootaloo says: "You saw how shifty he was acting earlier."
Scootaloo says: "There's no way he'll tell us what he's doing."
Scootaloo says: "Plus, I really wanna go undercover."
Scootaloo says: "We already have costumes!"
Scootaloo says: "Call me "Agent Rainbowhead"."
Sweetie Belle says: "I'll be "Shimmering Spectacles", a librarian with a mysterious past."
Apple Bloom says: "And I'll be a pirate spy!"
Apple Bloom says: "Arrrgh!"
Apple Bloom says: "A spy-rate!"
Apple Bloom says: "Avast!"
Apple Bloom says: "Our ship be leavin' port!"
Scootaloo says: "Huh?"
Apple Bloom says: "Big Mac's leavin'!"
Apple Bloom says: "If we're gonna be spies, we gotta go!"
Apple Bloom says: "Now!"
Apple Bloom says: "Big Mac's a-comin'!"
Apple Bloom says: "Quick!"
Apple Bloom says: "Act like apples!"
Sweetie Belle says: "What?"
Sweetie Belle says: "How?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Who's that pony?"
Scootaloo says: "Let me see!"
Scootaloo says: "I dunno."
Scootaloo says: "Shouldn't have taken the binoculars."
Scootaloo says: "I don't know anypony here."
Apple Bloom says: "That must be Sugar Belle."
Apple Bloom says: "Applejack told me about her bakery."
Apple Bloom says: "Obviously, she's just been orderin' a lot of apples."
Sweetie Belle says: "So nothing fishy's going on."
Scootaloo says: "No way!"
Scootaloo says: "We came here to be spies!"
Scootaloo says: "And no spy I know has ever solved a case that quick!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Mmm, how many spies do you know?"
Scootaloo says: "That's..."
Scootaloo says: "not important."
Scootaloo says: "What's important is that we do more recon."
Scootaloo says: "Follow my lead!"
Apple Bloom says: "Mm."
Sweetie Belle says: "Mm."
Apple Bloom says: "Whoa."
Apple Bloom says: "She sure likes her apples."
Sweetie Belle says: "What is she doing?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Making the biggest apple pie in Equestria?"
Sugar Belle says: "Thanks for coming all this way, Big Mac."
Big McIntosh says: "Pfft!"
Sugar Belle says: "It sure is nice seeing you again so soon."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Sugar Belle says: "All I used to bake were boring old muffins, but thanks to your apple deliveries, I get to bake all kinds of delicious treats!"
Sugar Belle says: "Apple pies, apple fritters, apple turnovers, caramel apples, caramel apple cakes..."
Sugar Belle says: "I just wish I had more room to display it all."
Sugar Belle says: "My shelves only hold so much."
Apple Bloom says: "I'm tellin' you, this pony reeeeaaally likes her apples."
Sweetie Belle says: "Or Big Mac!"
Apple Bloom says: "Huh?"
Scootaloo says: "Huh?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Just look!"
Sugar Belle says: "Ooh!"
Sugar Belle says: "Uh..."
Big McIntosh says: "Oh, I..."
Apple Bloom says: "Sweetie Belle, I-I think you're right!"
Apple Bloom says: "I think my brother has a crush!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Shh!"
Apple Bloom says: "Psst!"
Apple Bloom says: "Big Mac!"
Apple Bloom says: "Now remember, my brother's super shy, so he's probably gonna be embarrassed about his crush."
Apple Bloom says: "Just try and make him feel comfortable."
Apple Bloom says: "Hey, Big Mac, it's me!"
Apple Bloom says: "Apple Bloom!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Sweetie Belle says: "We're here, too!"
Scootaloo says: "We're here, too!"
Big McIntosh says: "Mm-hmm."
Apple Bloom says: "I'm gonna ask you a very personal question, and I want you to answer honestly."
Apple Bloom says: "Do you..."
Apple Bloom says: "have a crush on..."
Apple Bloom says: "Sugar Belle?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Scootaloo says: "Well, that was easy."
Apple Bloom says: "This is so excitin'!"
Apple Bloom says: "My big brother has his very first crush!"
Scootaloo says: "First crush?"
Scootaloo says: "What about Cheerilee?"
Sweetie Belle says: "It doesn't really count when you trick a pony into drinking a love potion, does it?"
Big McIntosh says: "Nnope!"
Apple Bloom says: "Wait!"
Apple Bloom says: "Does Sugar Belle even know you like her?"
Big McIntosh says: "Uh-uh."
Apple Bloom says: "Then you gotta tell her!"
Big McIntosh says: "O-Oh..."
Big McIntosh says: "eh..."
Big McIntosh says: "ehhhh..."
Sweetie Belle says: "We're pretty sure she likes you!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I mean, she keeps ordering apples just so she can see you again."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeeyou think so?"
Scootaloo says: "Totally!"
Scootaloo says: "But you'll never know if you don't try."
Big McIntosh says: "Okay!"
Scootaloo says: "Go get her, Big Mac!"
Feather Bangs says: "Hey, girl."
Feather Bangs says: "Heh-heh."
Feather Bangs says: "I was writin' poetry by the pond when I saw these flowers."
Feather Bangs says: "I thought I'd show them how pretty you are."
Sugar Belle says: "Oh!"
Sugar Belle says: "Heh."
Sugar Belle says: "Thanks, Feather Bangs."
Scootaloo says: "Um, is it possible to have two crushes at once?"
Scootaloo says: "Because it looks like Big Mac may not be the only pony Sugar Belle likes."
Apple Bloom says: "Hey, Big Mac!"
Apple Bloom says: "Where ya goin'?"
Big McIntosh says: "Home!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You can't let that Feather fella get in the way of your one true love!"
Scootaloo says: "You've gotta take him down!"
Apple Bloom says: "What can he do that you can't?"
Big McIntosh says: "That!"
Feather Bangs says: "Whoops!"
Feather Bangs says: "Heh-heh."
Feather Bangs says: "These balls are like you."
Feather Bangs says: "I'll always catch you if you fall."
Scootaloo says: "Seriously?"
Scootaloo says: "That line worked?"
Big McIntosh says: "She'll never pick me."
Apple Bloom says: "Sure she will, 'cause we're gonna help you."
Big McIntosh says: "No love potions!"
Apple Bloom says: "Don't worry, Big Mac."
Apple Bloom says: "We learned our lesson the hard way."
Scootaloo says: "Yeah."
Scootaloo says: "We're never gonna do that again."
Sweetie Belle says: "Besides, I know exactly what to do!"
Sweetie Belle says: "When I was younger, I read all the fairy tales."
Scootaloo says: "When you were "younger", huh?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, I was younger on the way here!"
Sweetie Belle says: "It was a long ride!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Anyway, as long as we do what the book says, you're pretty much guaranteed a happy ending."
Sweetie Belle says: "Uh, how about this one?"
Sweetie Belle says: ""Rescuing a damsel-pony-in-distress."
Sweetie Belle says: "" That's perfect!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Of course, we'll have to improvise without a dragon."
Apple Bloom says: "Huh."
Apple Bloom says: "Too bad Spike isn't here."
Apple Bloom says: "Not that he's very threatening."
Scootaloo says: "So what should we do?"
Scootaloo says: "Wait around for Sugar Belle to get herself into a scary situation?"
Apple Bloom says: "Or..."
Apple Bloom says: "we bring the danger to her."
Apple Bloom says: "All right."
Apple Bloom says: "Scootaloo's gonna pretend to take Sugar Belle's things, then you swoop in and stop her."
Apple Bloom says: "Ready?"
Big McIntosh says: "Nnope."
Sweetie Belle says: "Come on!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You're gonna be her hero!"
Sweetie Belle says: "In fairy tales, the knight in shining armor always gets the girl."
Big McIntosh says: "Hmmm..."
Big McIntosh says: "Mm-hmm."
Sugar Belle says: "Oh!"
Sugar Belle says: "Somepony, help!"
Feather Bangs says: "Here's your sugar, Sugar."
Feather Bangs says: "Though it is not as sweet..."
Feather Bangs says: "..."
Feather Bangs says: "as you."
Sugar Belle says: "Thank you, Feather!"
Apple Bloom says: "That smooth-talkin' pony stole our rescue!"
Apple Bloom says: "And it totally would've worked!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Sweetie Belle says: "We're just gonna have to keep trying!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Big Mac, are you ready to take it up a notch?"
Big McIntosh says: "Oh, yup!"
Big McIntosh says: "Oh, nope."
Sweetie Belle says: "Trust us!"
Sweetie Belle says: "There's nothing more romantic than waking your special pony from a sleeping spell with a magical kiss!"
Sweetie Belle says: "See?"
Sweetie Belle says: ""They rode off into the sunset."
Apple Bloom says: "Any sign of Feather Bangs?"
Scootaloo says: "Negative!"
Scootaloo says: "Coast is clear!"
Apple Bloom says: "It's now or never, Big Mac!"
Feather Bangs says: "Oh-ho-ho, girl, you been workin' hard all day."
Feather Bangs says: "Allow me to treat you like the princess..."
Feather Bangs says: "..."
Feather Bangs says: "you are."
Sweetie Belle says: "Hey!"
Sweetie Belle says: "That's our metaphorical sunset they're riding off into!"
Scootaloo says: "All right!"
Scootaloo says: "This ends now!"
Scootaloo says: "Feather Bangs may have good timing, and..."
Scootaloo says: "a good mane..."
Scootaloo says: "uh, but let's see him compete with a song!"
Big McIntosh says: "S-Say what now?"
Apple Bloom says: "Of course!"
Apple Bloom says: "Why didn't we think of it before?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Every great love story hinges on the romantic musical number."
Sweetie Belle says: "Big Mac, you've gotta write a song for Sugar Belle!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Apple Bloom says: "Come on, Big Mac!"
"Swoon Song" says: "Feather Bangs is soooo romantic."
"Fond Feather" says: "When he speaks, I pretend he's talking to me."
Apple Bloom says: "Come on!"
Apple Bloom says: "You can do better than him!"
Apple Bloom says: "Just like we practiced!"
Big McIntosh.
We'll take a walk down by the river.
Watch the sunset from the field.
We'll plant the seeds of love together.
And water 'em right for a really good yield.
Sugar Belle, sweet as pie.
You're the apple of my eye.
A cherry blossom in a field of rye.
And when the heifer's milked and fed.
And the pigs are in the sty.
Won't you be there by my side?
Feather Bangs.
Oh, oh.
Oh, ah-oh.
When you appeared before me.
My heart stopped beating.
Stars crossed the sky.
To come see what I was seeing.
You were the one.
That made me believe I could fly.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Birds could not sing.
A song that's as beautiful.
I'd do anything.
That's irrefutable.
Painting my heart in the sky whoa-oh, oh.
Sugar, Sugar Belle, whoa-oh.
When will you tell me that you feel the same?
Like an angel on a candy cane.
Or the sunlight shining through a drain.
Big McIntosh.
Sugar Belle, when I look in your eyes.
I see the color blue.
And it reminds me of the sky above.
Uh, which is also... blue.
Feather Bangs.
Hey, hey, hey, yeah.
Be my sugarplum.
I will be your watermelon.
Every time you smile.
I can feel my heart a-swellin'.
Blood is rushing from my head to my hooves, yeah.
I start movin' when I'm feeling that groove, yeah.
Big McIntosh.
I've been writin' this song for you.
Searchin' for the perfect rhyme.
For the words I wanna say.
Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin'... Be mine.
Feather Bangs.
Michael Jackson sounds.
I know you could be the one for me.
Feel my heart a-beating like.
The rain upon a bumblebee.
Don't you see that I could, ah oh, ah oh.
Whenever you are near me, I'm so... ah-oh.
Big McIntosh.
Sugar Belle!
Roses are red and violets are blue!
Feather Bangs.
Sugar, Sugar!
My love is burning hot like a cheese fondue!
Big McIntosh.
Sugar Belle!
Feather Bangs.
Sugar Belle!
Big McIntosh.
Sugar Belle!
Feather Bangs.
Sugar Belle!
Big McIntosh.
Sugar Belle!
Feather Bangs.
Sugar Belle!
Big McIntosh and Feather Bangs.
Sugar Belle!
Sugar Belle says: "What in Equestria has gotten into you two?!"
Sugar Belle says: "!"
Sugar Belle says: "If you think I'm the kind of pony that likes all this nonsense, then you clearly don't know me at all!"
Sugar Belle says: "I wish everypony would just..."
Sugar Belle says: "leave me alone!"
Apple Bloom says: "Big Mac?"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, Big Mac?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "Well, nopony's seen him."
Apple Bloom says: "Aw, I feel terrible."
Apple Bloom says: "I've never seen my brother so upset before."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, Big Mac?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "Big Mac!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Are you okay?"
Big McIntosh says: "Nnope."
Apple Bloom says: "Sorry it didn't work out with Sugar Belle."
Sweetie Belle says: "We don't get it."
Sweetie Belle says: "Big, grand gestures always work in the fairy tales."
Big McIntosh says: "But Sugar Belle's not a fairy tale princess."
Big McIntosh says: "She's a real pony."
Big McIntosh says: "She's kind, and she works hard, and she's sweeter than everything in her bakery."
Apple Bloom says: "That's it!"
Apple Bloom says: "We shoulda been thinking about what would mean a lot to Sugar Belle!"
Big McIntosh says: "Hmmm..."
Big McIntosh says: "I know just the thing!"
Big McIntosh says: "But I'm gonna need your help!"
Apple Bloom says: "Really?"
Apple Bloom says: "Even after we messed it up?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Big McIntosh says: "Come on!"
Sugar Belle says: "Oh, okay."
Sugar Belle says: "I'm..."
Sugar Belle says: "Wait a minute."
Sugar Belle says: "You look familiar."
Scootaloo says: "I shouldn't."
Scootaloo says: "Um, uh, I'm new in town."
Scootaloo says: "Mind showing me around?"
Sugar Belle says: "Uh, sure."
Sugar Belle says: "That's the whole town."
Sugar Belle says: "It's just the one street."
Scootaloo says: "Oh, no!"
Scootaloo says: "Clumsy me!"
Scootaloo says: "Here, let me help you clean it up!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I don't think Scootaloo can hold her off much longer."
Scootaloo says: "Uh, n-now hold on a minute."
Scootaloo says: "Are you sure I can't buy you a new bag?"
Sugar Belle says: "I'm good."
Sugar Belle says: "It's no big deal."
Sugar Belle says: "Okay, what's going on?"
Scootaloo says: "Ahhh!"
Scootaloo says: "The cupcake has landed!"
Scootaloo says: "Repeat – the cupcake has landed!"
Scootaloo says: "Oof!"
Sugar Belle says: "Big Mac!"
Sugar Belle says: "You made me a new display case?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Sugar Belle says: "And you made it bigger!"
Sugar Belle says: "You remembered!"
Sugar Belle says: "Which means..."
Sugar Belle says: "I can make even more!"
Sugar Belle says: "I've been dying to try baking cream pies and whoopie pies and icebox cakes and, of course, more apple treats!"
Sugar Belle says: "Oh, Big Mac, thank you so much."
Sugar Belle says: "This is the sweetest thing anypony's ever done for me."
Big McIntosh says: "Uh, y-y-yeah or-or nope or..."
Sugar Belle says: "I like you, too."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Awwwww!"
Apple Bloom says: "That was the most romantic thing ever!"
Sugar Belle says: "Wait a minute."
Sugar Belle says: "I recognize you fillies."
Sugar Belle says: "Have they been with you this whole time?"
Big McIntosh says: "Ee—"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm Big Mac's little sister, and these are my friends."
Apple Bloom says: "We're sorry for everything we put you through today, Sugar Belle."
Apple Bloom says: "Big Mac never would've gone through with all of those crazy..."
Sweetie Belle says: "..."
Sweetie Belle says: "over-the-top..."
Scootaloo says: "..."
Scootaloo says: "downright ridiculous..."
Apple Bloom says: "..."
Apple Bloom says: "attempts to impress you if we hadn't put him up to it."
Apple Bloom says: "But we learned our lesson."
Apple Bloom says: "Romance isn't about impressin' somepony."
Apple Bloom says: "It's about doin' somethin' that means somethin' special to that pony you love—"
Apple Bloom says: "Heh..."
Apple Bloom says: "like a lot."
Sweetie Belle says: "Uh, Apple Bloom, I think they get it."
Feather Bangs says: "Yeah."
Scootaloo says: "Sorry, Feather."
Scootaloo says: "You're a little too late."
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah!"
Apple Bloom says: "Sugar Belle's already picked her special somepony!"
Sweetie Belle says: "But don't worry."
Sweetie Belle says: "You've got three not-so-secret admirers right behind you!"
Feather Bangs says: "What should I say to them?"
Apple Bloom says: "Uh, you're askin' us for advice?"
Feather Bangs says: "Uh-huh."
Feather Bangs says: "Look, I-I can mane flip, write poetry, and juggle, but actually talkin' to a pony?"
Feather Bangs says: "Oh, it scares me almost as much as loneliness."
Feather Bangs says: "Will you help me?"
Feather Bangs says: "Please?"
Apple Bloom says: "Gee, I don't know about this."
Scootaloo says: "He just needs a little nudge in the conversation department."
Scootaloo says: "Besides, I don't think Big Mac's ready to leave just yet."
Sweetie Belle says: "Let's do it!"
Apple Bloom says: "Feather Bangs, the Cutie Mark Crusaders are..."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "..."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "at your service!"
