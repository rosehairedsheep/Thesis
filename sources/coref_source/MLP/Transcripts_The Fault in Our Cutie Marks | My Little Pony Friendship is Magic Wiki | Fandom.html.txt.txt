Sweetie Belle says: "So Scootaloo's keeping Petunia busy like you asked."
Sweetie Belle says: "What did you two want to talk about?"
Mrs. Paleo says: "I'm sure you get these questions all the time."
Mrs. Paleo says: "Oh, this is so awkward."
Mr. Paleo says: "Um, you're the experts, so we thought you'd have some insight into our daughter's new, uh, cutie mark."
Apple Bloom says: "What's wrong?"
Mrs. Paleo says: "Obviously, we're both very proud of her and her cutie mark..."
Mr. Paleo says: "Despite its, um..."
Mr. Paleo says: "unsettling nature."
Sweetie Belle says: "Unsettling?"
Apple Bloom says: "I don't get what you mean."
Mrs. Paleo says: "Her mark doesn't..."
Mrs. Paleo says: "bother you at all?"
Scootaloo says: "Hey!"
Scootaloo says: "Check out what we found!"
Petunia Paleo says: "Look!"
Petunia Paleo says: "A spiny-backed ponysaurus!"
Petunia Paleo says: "In our own backyard!"
Petunia Paleo says: "And I found him on my very own!"
Petunia Paleo says: "How cool is that?!"
Petunia Paleo says: "!"
Mrs. Paleo says: "Oh!"
Mr. Paleo says: "Oh!"
Mrs. Paleo says: "She's an archaeologist."
Mr. Paleo says: "She's an archaeologist."
Scootaloo says: "Of course!"
Scootaloo says: "What'd you think she was gonna be, a pirate?"
Mrs. Paleo says: "Pirate?"
Mrs. Paleo says: "Pfft!"
Mrs. Paleo says: "Why would we think that?"
Scootaloo says: "Woo-hoo!"
Scootaloo says: "Another successful cutie intervention!"
Scootaloo says: "You know, Crusaders, I don't wanna toot our own horn, but we've helped a lot of ponies figure out their purpose in life."
Scootaloo says: "Like Bluenote here."
Scootaloo says: "Nice saxophone, Bluenote!"
Apple Bloom says: "Yep, everywhere you look, there's a pony we've helped find a purpose."
Apple Bloom says: "You've gotta admit."
Apple Bloom says: "We've had a pretty good effect on everypony since we've discovered our destiny."
Scootaloo says: "And started helping other ponies discover theirs!"
Scootaloo says: "Could this get any better or what?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Now, Scootaloo, you do know there will always be challenges?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Someday, somepony might even come to us with a problem that even we can't handle."
Sweetie Belle says: "Like, say..."
Apple Bloom says: "A griffon?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Ha!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Exactly!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Like a griffon."
Sweetie Belle says: "But that's just crazy talk."
Scootaloo says: "Or not!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Is that really a griffon?"
Apple Bloom says: "You're darn tootin' it is!"
Apple Bloom says: "What do you think that griffon wants?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I guess we've gotta ask her, but aren't griffons supposed to be kind of mean and cranky?"
Scootaloo says: "Crusaders, looks like we've gotta step carefully."
Gabby says: "The Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Gabby says: "I can't believe it's really, really you!"
Scootaloo says: "Aah!"
Scootaloo says: "Ooh!"
Scootaloo says: "This..."
Scootaloo says: "griffon's..."
Scootaloo says: "not..."
Scootaloo says: "cranky."
Apple Bloom says: "How in the blooming apples did you know who we are?"
Gabby says: "Know who you are?"
Gabby says: "Know who you are?!"
Gabby says: "!"
Gabby says: "Why, I've heard about you from everypony in Ponyville!"
Gabby says: "I'm so excited to meet you, I could just explode!"
Gabby says: "I'm Gabriella, but you can call me Gabby since we're friends now!"
Gabby says: "Pleased to meet ya!"
Apple Bloom says: "Well, howdy..."
Apple Bloom says: "um..."
Apple Bloom says: "Gabby."
Gabby says: "I'm just about the most excited anygriffon has ever been about anything!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Excited?"
Sweetie Belle says: "But whatever for?"
Gabby says: "What for?"
Gabby says: "What for?!"
Gabby says: "!"
Gabby says: "Everypony in town tells me of your amazing assistance!"
Gabby says: "How you help ponies find their place in the world!"
Scootaloo says: "It's a calling, but—"
Gabby says: "And that's why I'm here."
Gabby says: "I need help, too."
Gabby says: "I want you to give me a cutie mark!"
Apple Bloom says: "Um, can a griffon even get a cutie mark?"
Scootaloo says: "I dunno, but I think we should probably find out."
Scootaloo says: "So, Gabriella..."
Gabby says: "Gabby, 'kay?"
Scootaloo says: "Gabby, why do you even want a cutie mark?"
Scootaloo says: "It doesn't seem like a very..."
Scootaloo says: "griffon-y thing to want."
Gabby says: "Right?"
Gabby says: "Right?!"
Gabby says: "!"
Gabby says: "Right?!"
Gabby says: "!"
Gabby says: "You're tellin' me!"
Gabby says: "I don't know if you've heard, but griffons can be a little bit..."
Gabby says: "unfriendly."
Gabby says: "Most griffons don't pay much attention to each other."
Gabby says: "And if they do, it's not, y'know, the good kind of attention."
Gabby says: "As for me, I'm just a little mail delivery griffon who likes to spread a little bit of griffon-y sunshine on my rounds, which always makes me feel different from the other griffons."
Gabby says: "I'd do anything for any old griffon in need."
Elderly griffon says: "Ahh!"
Elderly griffon says: "Uhh!"
Gabby says: "But it just always seemed like the harder I tried, the less I fit in."
Gabby says: "It wasn't until your friends came to Griffonstone that I realized some creatures actually like helping each other, and I saw something so awesomely awesome – how helping spreads from pony to pony and griffon to griffon!"
Gabby says: "I knew then that I had to find out why I was so different from the other griffons, and I knew the answer just had to have something to do with those wonderful, amazing marks on the ponies' flanks."
Gabby says: "And I admit, hehe, I became, um, maybe a little obsessed."
Gabby says: "So first chance I had to deliver a letter from Gilda, I took it, so I could find the perfect pony to help me understand what those marks are."
Gabby says: "Everypony here told me one thing – I just had to see the Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Gabby says: "They've helped everypony here get their cutie marks, and I knew, I just knew, that someday I'd have one, too!"
Gabby says: "A cutie mark of my very own!"
Gabby says: "That's why I flew all the way here!"
Gabby says: "I want to find my own place in the world, and I know you can help me by giving me a cutie mark!"
Gabby says: "So let's make with the cutie!"
Gabby says: "Whenever you're ready."
Gabby says: "Did it happen yet?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Uh, not exactly."
Gabby says: "Howboutnowhowboutnowhowboutnowhowboutnow?"
Apple Bloom says: "Um, Gabby, I hate to break it to ya, but it sounds like you might've heard some tall tales about what Crusaders can do."
Scootaloo says: "I mean, we are kinda awesome and all, but nopony can just give you a cutie mark."
Scootaloo says: "It just sort of..."
Scootaloo says: "happens."
Sweetie Belle says: "Though I'm pretty sure it doesn't happen to griffons."
Sweetie Belle says: "Or if it does, we've never ever heard of it."
Gabby says: "Oh."
Gabby says: "I hadn't thought of that."
Gabby says: "Sounds like a challenge!"
Gabby says: "And who could be up to it but the world-famous Cutie Mark Crusaders?"
Gabby says: "Cutie marks!"
Gabby says: "It's in your name and everything, right?"
Gabby says: "Right?!"
Gabby says: "!"
Gabby says: "Right?!"
Gabby says: "!"
Gabby says: "Now I have to deliver Gilda's letter to Rainbow Dash."
Gabby says: "I bet by the time I get back, you'll have it one hundred percent figured out!"
Gabby says: "Toodles for now!"
Gabby says: "Whee-hee-hee!"
Gabby says: "Gonna get my cutie mark!"
Sweetie Belle says: "What she wants..."
Sweetie Belle says: "It's not possible, right?"
Scootaloo says: "I don't know."
Scootaloo says: "But I know someone who just might."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've read every book on the subject, and I've never read a thing about any creature other than a pony getting a cutie mark."
Scootaloo says: "But, Twilight, Gabby flew all the way here so we could help her."
Scootaloo says: "There's gotta be something we can do."
Sweetie Belle says: "Say, is there some kind of spell you can whip up to make her mark appear?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Um, I don't know if any of you remember, but using magic to get a cutie mark never really works out all that well."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Ohhh."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Right."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Crusaders, I'm sorry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "While I can't say for certain that it's utterly impossible, the chances of Gabby getting an actual mark are..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "pretty slim."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Everything I've ever learned tells me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's just not gonna happen."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, no!"
Apple Bloom says: "Poor Gabby!"
Apple Bloom says: "What the apples are we ever gonna tell her?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Crusaders, this is terrible!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Gabby really believed in us."
Sweetie Belle says: "And now, we're gonna let her down."
Apple Bloom says: "But what else can we do?"
Scootaloo says: "Hmm."
Scootaloo says: "You know what, Crusaders?"
Scootaloo says: "So what?"
Scootaloo says: "Maybe we can't help Gabby get a cutie mark, but we can still do what we're best at."
Scootaloo says: "We can help her find her purpose!"
Apple Bloom says: "And I reckon doing that is the same for griffons as it is for ponies or any other creature in Equestria."
Scootaloo says: "All we have to do is be extra-special clear with her."
Scootaloo says: "Like, Crystal Empire clear."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Yeah!"
Gabby says: "Incoming!"
Gabby says: "Hiya, you wonderful, wonderful Crusaders!"
Gabby says: "I just know you've figured out how to help me because you're all so incredible!"
Scootaloo says: "Well, Gabby, we've talked it over, and we think we may just be able to help you out."
Scootaloo says: "But not exactly in the way you think."
Scootaloo says: "See, here's the thing about you getting a cutie mark—"
Gabby says: "I'm getting a cutie mark!!!"
Gabby says: "Woo-hoo-hoo!"
Scootaloo says: "Wait!"
Scootaloo says: "You didn't let me finish!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Um, I think maybe that could've been clearer."
Sweetie Belle says: "She's still going."
Sweetie Belle says: "Anypony know if griffons ever get tired?"
Gabby says: "What do you think my mark will be?"
Gabby says: "A lightning bolt?"
Gabby says: "An erupting volcano?"
Gabby says: "I don't care if it's a jar of marmalade!"
Gabby says: "I know I'll love it, whatever it is!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hold on just a hoofstep, Gabby."
Apple Bloom says: "There's somethin' we need to clear up."
Apple Bloom says: "We can definitely help you find your purpose, but that mark's probably not gonna happen."
Gabby says: "What?!"
Gabby says: "!"
Gabby says: "?"
Scootaloo says: "It's true."
Scootaloo says: "Twilight's never heard of a creature other than a pony getting a cutie mark."
Gabby says: "Oh!"
Gabby says: "Is that all?"
Gabby says: "You had me worried for a second."
Gabby says: "I-I mean, there's a first time for everything, right?"
Gabby says: "And she didn't say it was impossible, right?"
Apple Bloom says: "Well, not exactly."
Gabby says: "Well, then if anypony can make it happen, it's you three."
Gabby says: "I mean, you haven't failed yet."
Scootaloo says: "You know what, Gabby?"
Scootaloo says: "I promise we're gonna do everything we can to help you get your mark."
Gabby says: "Oh!"
Gabby says: "It's gonna happen!"
Gabby says: "I can feel it!"
Gabby says: "Woo-hoo!"
Gabby says: "Woo-hoo!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Aaaaand..."
Sweetie Belle says: "she's off again."
Apple Bloom says: "Why in tarnation would you promise somethin' that just can't be done?"
Scootaloo says: "I know what it's like to want something that's out of reach."
Scootaloo says: "And just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it can't."
Scootaloo says: "Maybe trying for the impossible isn't so bad."
Sweetie Belle says: "Guess we'll never know for sure unless we give it a try."
Apple Bloom says: "All right, but where do we even start?"
Scootaloo says: "Where we always do – with a good old-fashioned Crusaders chart."
Apple Bloom says: "The first thing we gotta do is find your purpose."
Scootaloo says: "Nopony gets a mark without one."
Gabby says: "All right."
Gabby says: "Let's do this."
Scootaloo says: "What are you good at?"
Scootaloo says: "Do you play any sports?"
Apple Bloom says: "Or like to dance?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Or how about singing?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I just love to sing!"
Sweetie Belle says: "La-la-la-la!"
Gabby says: "Wow!"
Gabby says: "I kinda wanna just try everything!"
Gabby says: "I mean, I don't even know what to pick!"
Scootaloo says: "Don't worry."
Scootaloo says: "That's what we're here for."
Sweetie Belle.
Like a racer at the starting line.
You're chomping at the bit.
Scootaloo.
You are here to find your purpose.
And a place you really fit.
Apple Bloom.
And until you find your place in life.
You're never gonna quit.
Cutie Mark Crusaders.
We can help you find the purpose in your life.
Gabby.
A griffon mixes lion's strength.
With winged eagle's might.
When I finally find my purpose.
Then my cutie mark's in sight.
Crusaders, I won't let you down.
I've just begun to fight.
You're gonna help me find the purpose in my life.
Got a job that's just no fun?
Call on me, I'll get it done.
Cauldron's stuck and needs a mix?
I'm the one who's got the fix.
Help you teach pre-calculus.
Scrub the floors, won't make a fuss.
Clearing kelp? Just give a yelp.
Raring to go, ready to help!
Cutie Mark Crusaders.
That's the spirit.
You ought to see what you do best.
Try it all, pick your fave.
And leave behind the rest.
Gabby.
I'll try anything.
To get my cutie mark.
Keep up with me, Crusaders.
We're just getting our start.
Rock your little ones to sleep.
While hanging up the sheets.
I can help you with your heavy load.
Walk Granny 'cross the street.
I'll run you 'round the bases fast.
It's really no big feat.
Cutie Mark Crusaders.
Can we help her find the purpose in her life?
Gabby.
Cheer you if you're feeling low.
Plant your garden, make it grow.
Write a piece for your quartet.
Filling in on clarinet.
Bake that cake as fast as lightning.
Cutie Mark Crusaders.
She's so good at things, it's frightening.
Cutie Mark Crusaders,.
I think we've got a problem!
Gabby.
Build a boat.
And sail it out across the sea.
Need some help?
You know that you can count on me.
CMCs, you're gonna help me find my purpose.
The purpose in my life!
In my life!
Apple Bloom says: "Now how we gonna do this?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Gabby's special purpose can't be everything, right?"
Apple Bloom says: "It may as well be."
Apple Bloom says: "I don't know how we find what she's supposed to do when she can do it all."
Scootaloo says: "And if finding her purpose seems impossible, we can just forget about the whole griffon-getting-a-cutie-mark thing, which is actually impossible."
Scootaloo says: "I never should've gotten her hopes up!"
Gabby says: "I did..."
Gabby says: "it..."
Gabby says: "all!"
Gabby says: "So, lay it on me, Crusaders."
Gabby says: "What's my purpose?"
Gabby says: "And how do we get a mark on these here haunches?"
Scootaloo says: "Gabby, we..."
Scootaloo says: "we don't."
Gabby says: "Wait."
Gabby says: "What are you saying?"
Apple Bloom says: "We're sayin' that since you can do everything so amazingly well..."
Sweetie Belle says: "We just can't figure out what one thing you're supposed to do."
Scootaloo says: "Gabby, we can't help you."
Gabby says: "But, but..."
Gabby says: "you're the world-famous Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Gabby says: "I can't believe it!"
Gabby says: "I..."
Gabby says: "I..."
Gabby says: "I won't believe it!"
Apple Bloom says: "Gabby, wait!"
Scootaloo says: "We're sorry!"
Scootaloo says: "We're so, so sorry!"
Scootaloo says: "This is just awful."
Scootaloo says: "For the first time ever, the Cutie Mark Crusaders are cutie mark failures."
Scootaloo says: "I'm sorry, Crusaders."
Scootaloo says: "I really thought we could help Gabby."
Sweetie Belle says: "I thought we could help anypony."
Apple Bloom says: "Maybe that's just it – maybe we can only help ponies."
Scootaloo says: "Or maybe we just plain failed."
Gabby says: "Failed?"
Gabby says: "Then what do you call this?!"
Gabby says: "!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "A cutie mark?!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "!"
Sweetie Belle says: "What?"
Sweetie Belle says: "You got your mark after all!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Even though we couldn't find your purpose?"
Sweetie Belle says: "But– What?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Huh?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
Sweetie Belle says: "How?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "And what does it mean?"
Apple Bloom says: "A cauldron?"
Gabby says: "Uh..."
Gabby says: "I don't know."
Gabby says: "Maybe it means my purpose is, uh, helping Zecora with potions."
Gabby says: "That was the first thing I tried."
Gabby says: "I guess it just took some time to appear."
Gabby says: "But here it is!"
Scootaloo says: "This is awesome!"
Scootaloo says: "We're not failures!"
Scootaloo says: "Whatever we did worked!"
Scootaloo says: "I had a feeling we could help you, and we did!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh!"
Apple Bloom says: "We've gotta go see Twilight right away!"
Apple Bloom says: "She'll wanna know about this!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Correction – she needs to know about this!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I bet she'll want to write a whole book about the very first griffon to get a cutie mark of her own!"
Gabby says: "Oh, uh, totally!"
Gabby says: "Um, but, you know, Rainbow Dash asked me to pick up her answer to Gilda's letter."
Gabby says: "I better take care of that before I forget."
Gabby says: "Heh."
Gabby says: "Here's an idea."
Gabby says: "Uh, y-you head to the castle, and I'll meet you there, cutie mark and all!"
Gabby says: "Um..."
Gabby says: "toodles!"
Scootaloo says: "Wow!"
Scootaloo says: "Can you believe it?"
Scootaloo says: "We were able to help her get her mark after all!"
Scootaloo says: "Come on, Crusaders, let's tell Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Gabby?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You just missed her."
Twilight Sparkle says: "She was in such a hurry, she didn't even come in."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Just dropped this letter and zoomed away!"
Scootaloo says: ""Dear Crusaders, I'll never forget you."
Scootaloo says: "You really are every bit as awesome as I'd heard."
Scootaloo says: "I'm heading home to tell all the griffons how you did the impossible by getting me my cutie mark."
Scootaloo says: "Toodles."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wait a second."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Cutie mark?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You actually got a griffon a cutie mark for the first time in recorded history?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You know what this calls for?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "A full-scale research project!"
Sweetie Belle says: "This makes no sense."
Sweetie Belle says: "Gabby didn't come in and show you her mark?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You have got to get Gabby back here right away!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I have so many questions!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, I hope I have enough ink and parchment to document everything!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Guess what just happened!"
Apple Bloom says: "Weird."
Apple Bloom says: "Gabby didn't show Twilight her mark like she said she was gonna do?"
Apple Bloom says: "Somethin' in this here applesauce smells kinda fishy."
Scootaloo says: "We'd better find her and find out what's going on."
Scootaloo says: "Come on, Crusaders."
Scootaloo says: "Keep your eyes on the skies, ponies."
Scootaloo says: "Gabby can't have gone far."
Apple Bloom says: "She's not in the air."
Apple Bloom says: "She's right there!"
Apple Bloom says: "Gabby!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hold up, we're a-comin'!"
Gabby says: "Um..."
Gabby says: "Sorry, no time to chat."
Gabby says: "I-I just stopped to help this pony get out of the muck, and then I really gotta fly."
Gabby says: "Okay?"
Gabby says: "Heave-ho!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Gabby, we're your friends."
Sweetie Belle says: "Why in Equestria are you running away from us?"
Gabby says: "Running away?"
Gabby says: "Oh, I'm not running away."
Gabby says: "I'm just, uh, e-excited to show my lovely new cutie mark to everyone in Griffonstone!"
Apple Bloom says: "You mean the cutie mark that's runnin' right off your flank?"
Gabby says: "Yup..."
Gabby says: "That's the one."
Gabby says: "I guess the one thing I'm really not good at is faking things."
Scootaloo says: "Wow, Gabby."
Scootaloo says: "Painting on a fake cutie mark to make yourself feel better?"
Scootaloo says: "You must have been really upset."
Gabby says: "Sure, I was disappointed."
Gabby says: "But I didn't do it to make myself feel better."
Gabby says: "I wanted to make you feel better."
Gabby says: "I couldn't bear you three thinking you failed after you tried so hard to help."
Gabby says: "That's why I had to leave before you or Twilight found out the truth."
Gabby says: "I'm sorry I wasn't honest with you."
Gabby says: "I'll just wing my way back to Griffonstone."
Gabby says: "Thanks for trying."
Apple Bloom says: "You don't need to apologize for carin' about how other ponies are feelin'."
Sweetie Belle says: "I'm just sorry we couldn't come through for you."
Scootaloo says: "Hmmm..."
Scootaloo says: "Maybe we can."
Scootaloo says: "Gabby, clean up and meet us at the Crusaders' clubhouse!"
Gabby says: "I know you all tried your very best, but I guess griffons and cutie marks just don't mix."
Gabby says: "Maybe..."
Gabby says: "I don't even have a special purpose."
Scootaloo says: "Hang on a second."
Scootaloo says: "We were racking our brains trying to figure out your destiny, until we remembered how every time you did something new, you tried to help everypony around you."
Sweetie Belle says: "Even us."
Sweetie Belle says: "How did it feel when you showed up with that fake mark, and the three of us thought we'd actually helped you?"
Gabby says: "Well..."
Gabby says: "I was really glad I helped you feel happier."
Scootaloo says: "So maybe helping is your thing!"
Scootaloo says: "You might even say it's your purpose!"
Gabby says: "But helping just feels good."
Gabby says: "I-It couldn't have anything to do with what I'm supposed to do with my life..."
Gabby says: "right?"
Scootaloo says: "Gabby, finding your special purpose doesn't have to be about being good at something."
Scootaloo says: "It's about feeling good about something inside."
Apple Bloom says: "And it looks like your destiny is a whole lot like ours – helping others."
Apple Bloom says: "And you don't need a symbol on your flank to know that."
Sweetie Belle says: "But since we are the Cutie Mark Crusaders, we made you one anyway."
Sweetie Belle says: "Behold!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Your very own cutie mark!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Ta-da!"
Scootaloo says: "We carved it to mark the moment we all figured out what you should do with your life."
Gabby says: "But they look just like yours."
Gabby says: "You can't mean..."
Gabby says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "You bet we do!"
Scootaloo says: "You're one of us now!"
Scootaloo says: "Gabby, today we dub thee..."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "The very first griffon member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Woo-hoo!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You may not be able to get a cutie mark..."
Apple Bloom says: "But you're selflessly dedicatin' your life to helpin' others anyhow."
Apple Bloom says: "I can't think of anything more Crusader-y than that."
Gabby says: "Awesome!"
Gabby says: "My very own cute-ceañera!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, land sakes!"
Apple Bloom says: "You sure have earned it."
Sweetie Belle says: "And so have we!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Scootaloo, you're pretty amazing."
Sweetie Belle says: "Even though things looked bleak, you still found a way to help Gabby in the end."
Scootaloo says: "'Course!"
Scootaloo says: "Helping's what we do, right?"
Gabby says: "I am so grateful!"
Gabby says: "I'm gonna go home and do my very, very best to bring Cutie Mark Crusader values to Griffonstone!"
Gabby says: "I promise."
Scootaloo says: "Promise us one other thing, too?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Come back soon!"
Scootaloo says: "After all, you're a Crusader now."
Scootaloo says: "Crusaders forever?"
Gabby says: "Crusaders forever!"
