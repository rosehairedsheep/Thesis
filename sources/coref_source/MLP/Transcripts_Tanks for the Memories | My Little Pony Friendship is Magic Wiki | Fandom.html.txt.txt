Rainbow Dash says: "Look at that, Tank!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Cloudsdale's here!"
Rainbow Dash says: "That means Ponyville is next up for winter!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You're doing awesome, everypony!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Keep it up!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We need those leaves off those trees!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Once we get autumn cleared away, it'll be hello, winter!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Was that a yawn I just saw?"
Rainbow Dash says: "How can you be tired when the most exciting time of the year is right around the corner?"
Rainbow Dash says: "And don't forget the best part – our first winter together!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on, wake up!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Once those ponies bring in the big, fat clouds full of snowflakes, we'll have a ton of snow for our extreme sledding!"
Rainbow Dash says: "And over there, we can play horse hockey, with no shoulder or arm pads!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Everything's looking great, don't you think?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Almost everything."
Rainbow Dash says: "Does Tank look alright to you?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, he does seem to be moving a little slowly."
Rainbow Dash says: "I know, right?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And he looks kind of sleepy..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Totally!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "just like he always does."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, ha ha, I'm sure you're right."
Rainbow Dash says: "Well?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "I suppose his heartbeat could be a teensy-weensy-eensy bit slower than usual..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay, so give him a vitamin or something!"
Fluttershy says: "I don't think he needs that."
Rainbow Dash says: "Maybe we're just staying up too late."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, too many Daring Do stories."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, that's not it either."
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, what's wrong with him then?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Nothing!"
Fluttershy says: "He's perfectly fine."
Fluttershy says: "He's just going to hibernate."
Rainbow Dash says: "You do realize he's not a bear, right?"
Fluttershy says: "When the weather grows cold and less food is available, many animals hibernate to conserve energy."
Fluttershy says: "It's like taking a really long nap during winter, and then they wake up in spring."
Fluttershy says: "And see?"
Fluttershy says: "Even tortoises do it!"
Fluttershy says: "When the time comes, Tank will leave and dig into the ground."
Fluttershy says: "But don't worry."
Fluttershy says: "He'll reappear when the spring sun warms the ground back up."
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Tortoises don't hibernate!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Somepony put that picture in there as a joke."
Fluttershy says: "It's not a joke."
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, then your book must be wrong!"
Fluttershy says: "Rainbow Dash, Tank needs to hibernate."
Fluttershy says: "It's healthy for him, just like sleeping is healthy for us."
Rainbow Dash says: "Whatever."
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay, thanks."
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on, Tank."
Fluttershy says: "Where are you going?"
Rainbow Dash says: "To get a second opinion from a real reptile expert."
Spike says: "I told you, Rainbow Dash, I'm a dragon!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You're practically twins!"
Spike says: "I'm purple."
Rainbow Dash says: "But if you don't have to hibernate, why should Tank?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Spike says: "Because he's a tortoise and I'm a dragon!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Same family though, right?"
Spike says: "No!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'll take that as a yes."
Spike says: "Ugh!"
Spike says: "Look, if Fluttershy says tortoises hibernate, then I guarantee tortoises hiber—"
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, what would you know?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You're a dragon!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Nopony knows you like I do, Tank."
Rainbow Dash says: "All you need is some hard work to get the old blood pumping."
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on!"
Rainbow Dash says: "These things are heavy!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Chock full of snowflakes!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We're gonna have such a killer time in the snow, Tank."
Rainbow Dash says: "Tank?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Tank!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Aww, look at the cute wittle Tankie, all snuggly-wuggly, getting ready to hibern—"
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't say that word!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Which one?"
Pinkie Pie says: ""Snuggly"?"
Pinkie Pie says: ""Wuggly"?"
Pinkie Pie says: ""Tankie"?"
Pinkie Pie says: ""Hibernate"?"
Rainbow Dash says: "That one!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I was just saying how cute he—"
Rainbow Dash says: "If you think hiber..."
Rainbow Dash says: "– you know, that napping thing – is so cute, why don't you go do it?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Somewhere far away from here?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What are you looking at?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie Pie and I are just having a conversation!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Look, Rainbow Dash, we all know how upset you are about Tank hiber—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Shhhh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't say that word!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's what started this all!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We all know how upset you are about Tank."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But you shouldn't take your anger out on your friends."
Rainbow Dash says: "Who said anything about anger?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I didn't say anything about anger!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm not upset!"
Rainbow Dash says: "And I am not angry!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Do I look angry?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on, Tank!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Let's get out of here!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I need you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, not sleepy-eyed and scaly-tailed!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Which..."
Rainbow Dash says: "is exactly what you are."
Rainbow Dash says: "But get up anyway!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You can't hiber– you know."
Rainbow Dash says: "What about all the primo things we're gonna do together this winter?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Building snow ponies, starting snowball fights, sipping hot cider by the fire."
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't you wanna do those things with me?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Think, Rainbow Dash, think!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Tank's only hibernating because it's cold, right?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, I'd rather have him awake in the heat than asleep in the cold..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I just have to stop winter!"
Sunshower says: "So where do these clouds go?"
Open Skies says: "Over by Clear Skies."
Sunshower says: "But there's clear skies everywhere."
Clear Skies says: "Yo, Clear Skies right here!"
Sunshower says: "But there's clear skies over there, too!"
Clear Skies says: "That's Open Skies!"
Sunshower says: "There's open skies everywhere!"
Open Skies says: "I'm not everywhere."
Open Skies says: "I'm right here!"
Sunshower says: "Wait."
Sunshower says: "So you're Open Skies, and you're Clear Skies."
Sunshower says: "Then what's all that?"
Clear Skies says: "Open, clear skies!"
Open Skies says: "Open, clear skies!"
Open Skies says: "Hey, where'd our fluffy clouds go?"
Clear Skies says: "Fluffy Clouds?"
Clear Skies says: "He's over there!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Stopping winter is gonna be a breeze!"
Rainbow Dash.
When life gives you lemons.
You can make lemonade.
But life gave me Tank here.
And my choice has long been made.
No winter will come to Ponyville.
I'll do it on my own.
I will keep you by my side.
So I will not be alone.
And I'll fly, and I'll fly.
Until the end of the sky.
So I'll be the one who doesn't.
Have to say goodbye.
I'll clear the skies forever.
So we won't be apart.
I'll keep the weather warm for you.
And the winter will never start.
Weather-makers Pegasi.
You make the seasons in the sky.
I don't want to sabotage you.
But you see, I've got to try.
No winter can come here now.
I'll keep the warmth and the sun somehow.
I'm sorry, ponies, this has to be.
For I need my friend and he needs me.
I know it's wrong, but what does it matter?
I'll change it all, it's only the weather.
And nopony's gonna bring me down.
I'll keep the sunlight shining free.
And I'll bust the clouds apart so you can stay with me.
And I'll fly, and I'll fly.
Until the end of the sky.
So I'll be the one who doesn't.
Have to say goodbye.
I'll clear the skies forever.
So we won't be apart.
I'll keep the weather warm for you.
And the winter will never start!
Sunshower says: "Here comes the next shipment!"
Sunshower says: "Move those clouds over!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "For every hoof step back, they go three hoof steps forward!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What are we gonna do?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Cloudsdale."
Rainbow Dash says: "That's it, Tank!"
Rainbow Dash says: "If I can't stop winter in Ponyville, maybe I can stop it at the source!"
Mission Impossible-style music.
Rainbow Dash says: "Lunch hour!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Perfect!"
Rainbow Dash says: "The winter lab."
Rainbow Dash says: "We're in, Tank!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Now we just gotta figure out a way to shut it down."
Rainbow Dash says: "Sabotage snowflakes?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I think we gotta go bigger than that."
Rainbow Dash says: "Wait here."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hmm."
Rainbow Dash says: "We could get rid of these clouds, but..."
Rainbow Dash says: "that's still not big enough."
Rainbow Dash says: "Slam dunk!"
Rainbow Dash says: "With no water, they can't make clouds or snow!"
Rainbow Dash says: "They can't make winter!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I hate to do this to those weather ponies, but desperate times call for desperate measures!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oopsies!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Looks like these were a little loose!"
Rainbow Dash says: "And there goes winter down the drain!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, I can't see!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Aaaaaah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Let's get out of here!"
Applejack says: "What in the name of Celestia's goin' on up there?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Prepare yourselves, everypony!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Winter is coming!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Everypony, look out!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You okay, Tank?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Are you alright?"
Rainbow Dash says: "No..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Knock, knock!"
Fluttershy says: "How are you feeling, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whatever..."
Rarity says: "The poor thing looks so sad!"
Rarity says: "Just what are we doing to do?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't know what we can do."
Applejack says: "Buck up, Sugarcube."
Applejack says: "You just ain't yourself these days."
Rainbow Dash says: "Whatever..."
Rarity says: "Uh, how can I say this tactfully..."
Rarity says: "?"
Rarity says: "You've lost your sparkle, Rainbow Dash."
Pinkie Pie says: "I hate to say this, but, well..."
Pinkie Pie says: "you've become..."
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "A party pooper!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Didn't you hear me?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I said 'whatever'."
Rainbow Dash says: "I don't know if you're here to cheer me up or what, but I'm fine."
Fluttershy says: "Let me handle this."
Fluttershy says: "Rainbow Dash, your winter is going to be pet-less."
Rarity says: "Whatever did you do that for?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Because she'll never get past this until she lets it all out."
Applejack says: "Uh..."
Applejack says: "it's okay."
Applejack says: "Tank'll come back in a few months."
Rainbow Dash says: "Months?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Applejack says: "Alright, alright."
Applejack says: "There, there."
Applejack says: "Nice going, Fluttershy."
Applejack says: "How do we get her to stop?"
Fluttershy says: "She's got to be about done by now."
Fluttershy says: "Can't be too much left in there."
Fluttershy says: "Feeling better?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, you poor, poor thing..."
Rarity says: "I can't bear to see Fluttershy cry!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's just heart-wrenching!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You too?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Applejack says: "Nope, I'm good."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Look, everypony, I know how hard it is to say goodbye—"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm mostly sad because you're not sad!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Me?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What about Applejack?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Applejack cries on the inside, Twilight!"
Applejack says: "It's true."
Rainbow Dash says: "It's alright, Fluttershy."
Rainbow Dash says: "It's alright."
Applejack says: "You think she's done or just getting a third wind?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't know..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Are you okay?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, Tank..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm sure gonna miss you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, guess we're starting winter with a bang."
Applejack says: "The fun's come early!"
Applejack says: "Yee-haw!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You think we could mess up winter every year?"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's way less work!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh, I don't think Rainbow Dash could handle it."
Rainbow Dash says: "Riding that entire season from Cloudsdale to Ponyville was pretty awesome."
Rainbow Dash says: "I thought you guys might like to say goodbye to Tank."
Rainbow Dash says: "He's ready to hibernate."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh, you're using the word!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, she's using the word!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And when Tank finishes hibernating, I'm gonna throw him the biggest welcome home party ever!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Or wait."
Pinkie Pie says: "Should it be a 'welcome above ground' party?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Or a 'happy wake-up' party?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Maybe an 'it's about time!"
Pinkie Pie says: "' party!"
Rarity says: "And I'll design him a very special suit just for the occasion, whichever one it ends up being."
Applejack says: "I'm glad you're feelin' a little better, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, me too."
Rainbow Dash says: "So, you really wanna do this hibernating thing, huh?"
Rarity says: "Goodbye, Tank."
Fluttershy says: "Happy winter."
Applejack says: "See you later, little feller."
Pinkie Pie says: "Have a good sleep, Tank!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Goodbye, Tank!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We'll miss you!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ready for some winter fun?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, I'm gonna hang here and read to him a bit."
Rainbow Dash says: "That little guy can never get to sleep without a bedtime story."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'll be right there."
