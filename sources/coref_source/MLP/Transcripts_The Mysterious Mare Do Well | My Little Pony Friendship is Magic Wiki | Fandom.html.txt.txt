Scootaloo says: "Attention, everypony!"
Scootaloo says: "Attention!"
Scootaloo says: "The official Rainbow Dash Fan Club will come to order."
Scootaloo says: "Let's get right down to our first order of business."
Scootaloo says: "I motion that Rainbow Dash be declared the most awesome pony in Ponyville."
Snails says: "I second the motion, and might I add that if you looked up the word 'awesome' in the dictionary, there would be a picture of Rainbow Dash."
Snips says: "I object!"
Snips says: "I think the word 'awesome' is played out!"
Snips says: "Rainbow Dash deserves better!"
Snips says: "I motion that we declare her the most stupendous pony!"
Scootaloo says: "'Stupendous'?"
Scootaloo says: "Is that the best you've got?"
Scootaloo says: "I motion that we declare her..."
Scootaloo says: "wonderiffic!"
Snips says: "Astonishing!"
Scootaloo says: "Breathtaking!"
Snips says: "Astounding!"
Scootaloo says: "Bedazzling!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What about super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing?"
Scootaloo says: "All in favor of declaring Rainbow Dash the most 'super-ultra-extra-uh-whatever you said' pony in all of Ponyville, say 'aye'!"
Fan club says: "Aye!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What a beautiful day."
Rainbow Dash says: "There's nothing like a dip in the clouds to make a Pegasus feel super relaxed."
Aura says: "Help!"
Aura says: "Help!"
Aura says: "Help!"
Aura says: "Help!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Looks like my sky swim will have to wait!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm Rainbow Dash, and I'm here to rescue you!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wow."
Rainbow Dash says: "What's with this crowd?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, thanks, everypony."
Rainbow Dash says: "It was really no big deal."
Aura says: "To me it was!"
Aura says: "You're my hero, Rainbow Dash!"
Scootaloo says: "That Rainbow Dash sure is something."
Snips says: "Something special."
Snails says: "Something special."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh no!"
Rainbow Dash says: "There's something wrong with the baby!"
Rainbow Dash says: "She's not cheering for everypony's favorite hero, Rainbow Dash!"
Scootaloo says: "There just aren't enough words in the dictionary to describe Rainbow Dash's awesomeness."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can think of a few new words."
Applejack says: "And I bet 'modest' is not one of them."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, but she is kinda awesome."
Rainbow Dash says: "Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow Dash is here!"
Pony 1 says: "We'd be lost without you!"
Pony 2 says: "You're our hero, Rainbow Dash!"
Crowd says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Crowd says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I can't hear you!"
Crowd says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Crowd says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Crowd says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Crowd says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Crowd says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Crowd says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Crowd says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Call me silly, but I think this whole hero thing might be going to Rainbow Dash's head."
Pinkie Pie says: "You may be right..."
Pinkie Pie says: "silly."
Rainbow Dash says: "And then I zoomed into the well."
Rainbow Dash says: "I knew it would be dark and dangerous, but I didn't let that stop me."
Rainbow Dash says: "Danger's my middle name."
Rainbow Dash says: "Rainbow 'Danger' Dash."
Rainbow Dash says: "Thinking back on it, I acted pretty awesomely heroic that day."
Spike says: "That day."
Applejack says: "Awesomely heroic that day and awesomely arrogant ever since."
Pinkie Pie says: "Mm-hm."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Mm-hm."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, Applejack."
Rainbow Dash says: "How'd you like to be immortalized as my friend?"
Applejack says: "Immorta-what?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Are you taking notes?"
Spike says: "Yup!"
Spike says: "I've been hoof-picked by Rainbow Dash herself, to write her autobiography!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Umm, autobiographies are supposed to be written by the pony they are about."
Rainbow Dash says: "Maybe for your normal, run-of-the-mill ponies."
Rainbow Dash says: "But I'm far too busy saving lives to stop and write."
Rainbow Dash says: "That's why I hired Spike as my ghost writer."
Pinkie Pie says: "Spike's a ghost!"
Rainbow Dash says: "..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Anyway."
Rainbow Dash says: "Spike here writes down everything I say."
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't you, Spike?"
Spike says: "Don't..."
Spike says: "you..."
Spike says: "Spike."
Spike says: "Got it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "This way, I can stay focused on performing those acts of bravery that nopony else has the guts to perform."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yep, it takes guts."
Rainbow Dash says: "But it also takes brains."
Rainbow Dash says: "And sometimes a big lunch and a nap."
Rainbow Dash says: "Being a hero is surely not for everypony, but I'm up to the challenge."
Rainbow Dash says: "There you go."
"Lemon Daze" says: "Someday, I wanna be just like you!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Aim high, kid, but don't aim for the impossible."
Cherry Berry says: "Help!"
Cherry Berry says: "Help!"
Snips says: "Uh, don't you think you should go and help?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, yeah."
Rainbow Dash says: "I've got a good ten seconds to spare."
Rainbow Dash says: "Just a couple more."
Spike says: "The tension is unbearable."
Spike says: "Will Rainbow Dash make it on time?"
Pony says: "Holy turnips, that pony came outta nowhere!"
Daisy says: "I've never seen such bravery in all my life!"
Mayor Mare says: "That's right!"
Mayor Mare says: "Ponyville has a new hero."
Mayor Mare says: "A mysterious mare that has done well by our fair city today."
Mayor Mare says: "I dub this new masked hero 'The Mysterious Mare Do Well'!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Mare Do Well, huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Well that mare would do well to stay outta my way!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ponyville's only got room for one hero, and that hero is me!"
Globe Trotter says: "Excuse me, uh, do you think you could skip your catchphrase and just hurry up and save us?!"
Globe Trotter says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh, fine!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Picky, picky."
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoaaaa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Aah!"
"Wisp" says: "Oh, thank you, Mare Do We– e..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I can't believe it."
Rainbow Dash says: "Mare Do Well is stronger than me?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, a hero is more than just muscle, and she's gonna learn that the hard way."
Crafty Crate says: "Huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Never fear, your friendly neighbor– Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Never fear– Uh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm coming!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hold on!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa!"
Jack Hammer says: "Look!"
"Jim Beam" says: "Look out for the– Watch out for falling– On your left!"
"Jim Beam" says: "Agh!"
"Jim Beam" says: "Your other left!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Here ya go, safe and sound."
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, Mare Do Well, or should I call you Mare Do Slow?"
Rainbow Dash says: "You're gonna have to pick up the pace if you wanna compete with me, 'cause I move like lightning."
"Rivet" says: "Actually, she saved all of us!"
"Rivet" says: "We owe her our lives!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay."
Rainbow Dash says: "She's strong, fast, and somehow knows what's gonna happen ahead of time."
Rainbow Dash says: "I've gotta step up my game."
Rainbow Dash says: "If the dam breaks, the whole town will be flooded!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Looks like Ponyville needs a hero!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Easy peasy."
Rainbow Dash says: "My game is officially back on."
Rainbow Dash says: "If only somepony were here to pat me on the back."
Rainbow Dash says: "Eh, guess I'll have to do it myself–  Help!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I suppose you want me to thank– You gotta be kidding me..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Lemme get this straight."
Rainbow Dash says: "She's strong, she's agile, and she's magic?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ughhh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "How do I compete with that?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wait a minute."
Rainbow Dash says: "I do have a leg up on her."
Rainbow Dash says: "And that leg is..."
Rainbow Dash says: "wings!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Take that, Mare Do Well!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, for the love of Pete."
Applejack says: "Gotta hand it to the girl, that Mare Do Well sure can pull off some pretty heroic feats."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I must say, I was impressed by that spell she used to fix the dam."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Seems like something like that would take quite a bit of study."
Fluttershy says: "She really cares about everypony's safety."
Rarity says: "Have you seen her costume?"
Rarity says: "It is to die for!"
Rarity says: "If you ask me she's a hero of fashion."
Applejack says: "And she's modest and humble."
Applejack says: "She lets her actions speak for themselves."
Applejack says: "Gotta admire that."
Rainbow Dash says: "I don't have to admire that!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I don't think she's all that great!"
Spike says: "She's..."
Spike says: "great."
Rainbow Dash says: "I didn't say that."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sounds like somepony's jealous."
Rainbow Dash says: "Who, me?"
Spike says: "Rainbow Dash is jealous."
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't write that, Spike!"
Spike says: "Correction: Rainbow Dash is very jealous."
Rainbow Dash says: "Fine!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Laugh all you want, but I'll be the one laughing when I prove to you all that I'm just as good– no, that I'm a better hero than Mare Do Well!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh, no sign of trouble here."
Rainbow Dash says: "Darn it."
Rainbow Dash says: "Buses and baby carriages are always careening down this hill."
Rainbow Dash says: "Where is an out-of-control vehicle when you need one?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Rrgh, there are absolutely no freak natural disasters going on anywhere!"
Rainbow Dash says: "How am I supposed to prove myself when everything's so normal and safe?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hold it right there, Granny Smith!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You don't have to pretend with me."
Rainbow Dash says: "I can see that you're in way over your head here."
Granny Smith says: "Eh, what's that?"
Rainbow Dash says: "You're putting on a brave face, I get it."
Rainbow Dash says: "But you don't have to anymore."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'll help you cross the street!"
Granny Smith says: "Actually, I can cross the street just fine!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't worry!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You're in extremely..."
Rainbow Dash says: "capable..."
Rainbow Dash says: "hooves!"
Granny Smith says: "Back off!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Here we are!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Safe and sound."
Rainbow Dash says: "A good and heroic citizen deserves a little recognition, don't you think?"
Granny Smith says: "I didn't wanna cross the street in the first place!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Somepony's in trouble!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You'd better let me handle this, ma'am!"
Rainbow Dash says: "For your own safety, I must ask you to stand back!"
Amethyst Star says: "Oh, brother."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ta-da!"
Amethyst Star says: "Uh..."
Amethyst Star says: "thanks."
Rainbow Dash says: "How would you describe what I just did?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Would you say I was amazing?"
Amethyst Star says: "Aren't you milking this a bit?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Please, just answer the question!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Was I, or was I not, amazing?"
Amethyst Star says: "Oh, you're amazing alright."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, look!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Another great feat of heroism!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I have just saved that grass!"
"Pine Breeze" says: "From what?"
Rainbow Dash says: "From weeds!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Weeds that were attempting to eat this lawn!"
Liza Doolots says: "Lame..."
Pony says: "Whatever."
Rainbow Dash says: "Aww, who am I kidding?"
Rainbow Dash says: "All anypony talks about is Mare Do Well this and Mare Do Well that!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What about me?"
Rainbow Dash says: "How could everypony forget about me so easily?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I mean..."
Rainbow Dash says: "have I changed?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Same sleek body."
Rainbow Dash says: "Same flowing mane."
Rainbow Dash says: "Same spectacular hooves."
Rainbow Dash says: "Nope, I'm still awesome."
Rainbow Dash says: "They're wrong."
Rainbow Dash says: "But..."
Rainbow Dash says: "then..."
Rainbow Dash says: "why am I all alone?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I hate being all alone."
Scootaloo says: "Hey, Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I knew it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "No need to apologize, squirt."
Rainbow Dash says: "Anypony could make that mistake."
Scootaloo says: "Mistake?"
Scootaloo says: "What mistake?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wait a minute."
Rainbow Dash says: "Why are you here?"
Scootaloo says: "To invite you to join us!"
Scootaloo says: "We're heading off to the thank you parade for Ponyville's greatest hero, Mare Do Well."
Rainbow Dash says: "No!"
Rainbow Dash says: "No way!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Can't you see I-I wanna be alone?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I love being alone."
Scootaloo says: "Oh, okay."
Scootaloo says: "See you later then."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, right, like I'm gonna thank her."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, squirt!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wait up!"
Mayor Mare says: "Welcome to Ponyville's first, but surely not last, thank you parade, in honor of our city's greatest hero, the mysterious Mare Do Well!"
Rainbow Dash says: "The mysterious Mare Do Well, huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "So what are you hiding?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Let's see how mysterious you are without that mask!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What the hay?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Grrr..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I got you now!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Alright, Miss Mysterious!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Mystery..."
Rainbow Dash says: "solved!"
Rainbow Dash says: "P-p-p-p- Pinkie?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whudda- hud-d-duh- hud-d-duh- huh?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Twilight?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Applejack?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "There were three of you?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yup, we all played Mare Do Well at different times."
Applejack says: "I stopped the carriage bus with these babies, Bucky McGillicuddy and Kicks McGee."
Pinkie Pie says: "I saved the construction workers with my Pinkie Sense."
Cherry Berry says: "Sorry!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's alright."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And I used my magic to fix the dam."
Fluttershy says: "Ooh, ooh!"
Fluttershy says: "And I did the flyby afterwards."
Rarity says: "I made the costumes."
Rarity says: "Fabulous if I do say so myself!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I don't understand."
Rainbow Dash says: "Why?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't you want me to be a hero?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Of course we want you to be a hero."
Applejack says: "But a real hero doesn't brag."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, I guess I did start to brag a little."
Other main cast says: "A little?!"
Other main cast says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay, a lot."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Celebrating your accomplishments is natural."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But..."
Applejack says: "..."
Applejack says: "Rubbin' them in everypony's face is not."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah, the only thing that should be rubbed in anypony's face is chocolate cake."
Applejack says: "I think we're getting off topic here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What we're trying to say is, it's great to be really good at something, but it's important to act with grace and humility."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ohhhh."
Rainbow Dash says: "That makes loads more sense."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah."
Rainbow Dash says: "You're right."
Rainbow Dash says: "And I guess I should've also acted with grace and humility when others outshine me."
Rainbow Dash says: "Like Mare Do Well."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sounds like you've got a letter to write to Princess Celestia."
Spike says: "Already got it covered."
Spike says: "As your ghost writer, I've already penned a letter to the Princess."
Rainbow Dash says: "That's nice of you, Spike, but I really wanna write this letter myself."
Spike says: "Aww, come on, I wrote the whole thing already!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay, let's hear it."
Rainbow Dash says: "Look out!"
Rainbow Dash says: "It's a real ghost!"
