Scootaloo says: "Whatever they decide, Apple Bloom, we'll be here for you."
Sweetie Belle says: "Totally."
Sweetie Belle says: "Even though it could change everything for you, forever and ever!"
Granny Smith says: "So, we here have decided..."
Granny Smith says: "that you're old enough to stay home alone and take care of the chores yourself for the afternoon!"
Apple Bloom says: "I accept your decision."
Apple Bloom says: "Stayin' home alone, by myself, on my own!"
Apple Bloom says: "I can't believe I'm really doin' it!"
Applejack says: "Now, hey there, filly."
Applejack says: "I know you're excited, but bein' the only pony here to take care of the day's chores is a big responsibility."
Apple Bloom says: "I know it!"
Apple Bloom says: "And it means everythin' to me that y'all think I'm grown up enough to handle it."
Apple Bloom says: "I won't let you down."
Granny Smith says: "Well, if'n I'm gonna make my train, I best to be off."
Granny Smith says: "When Great Aunt Pine Apple says a pony's gots to ride by a certain time, you better be there!"
Granny Smith says: "You be sure and take care now, Apple Bloom."
Granny Smith says: "Y'all take care as well."
Granny Smith says: "I don't know which of your delivery routes is tougher."
Granny Smith says: "you're each headed to a mighty hard-to-reach town."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Applejack says: "We know, Granny."
Applejack says: "That's the only reason I agreed to let Apple Bloom stay behind alone."
Apple Bloom says: "It is?"
Applejack says: "Oh, I didn't mean it like that, sugarcube."
Applejack says: "It's just, I take my job as your big sister real serious, which is why I spent all night makin' this."
Apple Bloom says: "What is it?"
Applejack says: "Just a little list of helpful reminders."
Apple Bloom says: ""There's some soup for you in the 'frigerator."
Apple Bloom says: "Be sure not to heat it up too much."
Apple Bloom says: "If it's hot, blow on it to cool it off."
Apple Bloom says: "And take little sips—"
Apple Bloom says: "if you gulp, you could get hiccups."
Apple Bloom says: "" You don't have to worry about me."
Apple Bloom says: "I can take care of myself and the chores!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm ready for this."
Applejack says: "I guess you are."
Applejack says: "I'm just not so sure I am."
Apple Bloom says: "But you trust me and believe I'm grown up enough to handle this, right?"
Applejack says: "Right."
Applejack says: "Okay then."
Applejack says: "Good luck, little sis—"
Applejack says: "whoa!"
Apple Bloom says: "Okaygreatseeyousoonbye!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eyuu-up!"
Apple Bloom says: "Woo-hoo!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm alone!"
Apple Bloom says: "At home!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm home alone!"
Apple Bloom says: "This is gonna be so awesome!"
Applejack says: "Eheheh..."
Applejack says: "Sorry, Big Mac."
Applejack says: "I was just frettin' a bit about Apple Bloom."
Applejack says: "You think she's gonna be okay on her own?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Applejack says: "I just keep on thinkin' of things I forgot to put on her list."
Applejack says: "Like, I didn't write down that if she wants to get a spoon out of the drawer, she needs to open the drawer first."
Applejack says: "I know, I'm probably just bein' silly."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Applejack says: "But I know I'd feel a heap better if I could just check on Apple Bloom one last time."
Applejack says: "You go on ahead and make your delivery."
Applejack says: "I'm just gonna take a quick peek, and then I'll make mine."
Apple Bloom says: "Okay, number one seventy two: "Make sure to pump the bellows to keep the stove warm."
Apple Bloom says: "Check!"
Apple Bloom says: ""Make sure the hats and bows closet is fully stocked."
Apple Bloom says: "" Check!"
Apple Bloom says: "That's everything on Applejack's list!"
Apple Bloom says: "And now that my chores are done, since there's no one else here, I get to make all the decisions!"
Apple Bloom says: "If I wanna listen to music, I can!"
Apple Bloom says: "If I wanna read a book, I can!"
Apple Bloom says: "If I wanna just stand here in the kitchen talkin' to myself, I can!"
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom!"
Apple Bloom says: "Whoa!"
Apple Bloom says: "Ugh..."
Apple Bloom says: "Applejack?"
Applejack says: "I came back to check on you, and I'm so glad I did!"
Applejack says: "I never thought about how dangerous things are around here!"
Apple Bloom says: "Thanks, but I'm really gonna be okay."
Applejack says: "You are now!"
Applejack says: "Because I'm here and I'm stayin'!"
Applejack says: "No way am I leavin' my little baby sister home alone all by herself!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm not a baby!"
Apple Bloom says: "I can take care of myself!"
Apple Bloom says: "And what about those pies you're supposed to deliver?"
Applejack says: "Pies?"
Applejack says: "Ha!"
Applejack says: "Family's way more important than pies!"
Apple Bloom says: "But I'm fine!"
Apple Bloom says: "And actually..."
Apple Bloom says: "this was kind of your fault."
Applejack says: "I know."
Applejack says: "I should never have left you alone."
Apple Bloom says: "But I don't need you lookin' after me."
Apple Bloom says: "I'm perfectly capable of stayin' home alone."
Apple Bloom says: "Really!"
Apple Bloom says: "Just look!"
Apple Bloom says: ""There's some soup for you in the 'frigerator."
Applejack says: "What was that?"
Apple Bloom says: "Watch me!"
Apple Bloom says: "Whoa!"
Apple Bloom says: "Ugh!"
Applejack says: "Oh, no!"
Applejack says: "This is worse than I thought!"
Applejack says: "Well, don't worry, Apple Bloom, I'm here now and I'm not leavin' you home alone ever again."
Applejack says: "I'm stickin' right by your side, always!"
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom?"
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom!"
Apple Bloom says: "Applejack's just overreactin' a bit."
Apple Bloom says: "I'm sure she'll snap out of it."
Apple Bloom says: "Whoa!"
Applejack says: "You need somethin'?"
Applejack says: "I'm right here!"
Apple Bloom says: "I know you mean well, but I don't need you watchin' over me!"
Apple Bloom says: "I can take care of things myself!"
Apple Bloom says: "Look!"
Apple Bloom says: "Huh?"
Apple Bloom says: "Hey!"
Apple Bloom says: "Who put pillows on this rake?"
Applejack says: "Oh, I don't know."
Applejack says: "Maybe someone who really loves her little sister and doesn't want her to get an owie?"
Apple Bloom says: "Hey, Applejack!"
Apple Bloom says: "Watch me buck these apples on my own without anythin' bad happenin' to me!"
Apple Bloom says: "Huh?"
Apple Bloom says: "Hm?"
Apple Bloom says: "Hm."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, for the love of..."
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "You've gone and baby-proofed everythin'!"
Applejack says: "Heh, yup!"
Applejack says: "Your big sister let you down once, but I promise it won't ever happen again."
Apple Bloom says: "But really, I'm fine!"
Apple Bloom says: "I can take care of myself."
Apple Bloom says: "I don't need you watchin' over me!"
Applejack says: "Aw, that's sweet."
Applejack says: "I appreciate you tryin' to make me feel better, but don't worry."
Applejack says: "I'll always be here for you."
Applejack says: "Always!"
Apple Bloom says: "And that's the reason I asked y'all to come over quick."
Applejack says: "Hey, Apple Bloom!"
Applejack says: "You need anything?"
Applejack says: "A snack?"
Applejack says: "A hoof massage?"
Applejack says: "Maybe a snack while havin' a hoof massage?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Why, that sounds delightful!"
Apple Bloom says: "No thank you!"
Applejack says: "O-kay, well you can count on me bein' close by if'n you need anythin'!"
Apple Bloom says: "You see what I mean?"
Apple Bloom says: "If this keeps up, I'm never gonna be able to do anythin' without Applejack hoverin' over me!"
Scootaloo says: "Mm-hm."
Sweetie Belle says: "Mm-hm."
Scootaloo says: "So what can we do?"
Scootaloo says: "Hmm."
Sweetie Belle says: "Uh..."
Scootaloo says: "Um..."
Apple Bloom says: "Hang on a sec!"
Apple Bloom says: "I got it!"
Sweetie Belle says: "What?"
Apple Bloom says: "The pies!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'll sneak out and deliver them!"
Apple Bloom says: "Granny said that they were goin' to some incredibly hard-to-reach town."
Apple Bloom says: "If I can do it alone, that'll show Applejack I don't need somepony watchin' over me!"
Scootaloo says: "Just one problem."
Scootaloo says: "Your sister's gonna come back and check on you any minute!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Which means you need an escape plan."
Scootaloo says: "Ooh, and I got an idea for one!"
Scootaloo says: "See?"
Scootaloo says: "It'll look just like you're sleeping in bed."
Scootaloo says: "Sweetie and I can take turns!"
Scootaloo says: "That way, when one of us gets tired, the other can take over."
Scootaloo says: "Brilliant, huh?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Mm-hm!"
Apple Bloom says: "You know what?"
Apple Bloom says: "It is!"
Apple Bloom says: "I got a feelin' this just might work!"
We're gonna make my sister see.
I don't need her watchin' over me—.
Scootaloo says: "Stop!"
Scootaloo says: "No time for a song!"
Scootaloo says: "Applejack's coming!"
Sweetie Belle says: "If you're gonna go, we've gotta get you out of here now!"
Apple Bloom says: "Cutie Mark Crusaders, let's do it!"
Apple Bloom says: "Whoa!"
Applejack says: "Everythin' okay in there, sugarcube?"
Scootaloo says: "Quick, get in while I hide!"
Scootaloo says: "Sweetie, no!"
Scootaloo says: "You gotta sleep like Apple Bloom!"
Sweetie Belle says: "How does she sleep?"
Scootaloo says: "Like she does everything!"
Scootaloo says: "With sass!"
Applejack says: "Huh."
Applejack says: "I guess you must've been so tuckered out, you sent your friends home and went to bed."
Applejack says: "Then again, you are a delicate flower."
Applejack says: "Sleep tight, Apple Bloom."
Applejack says: "I'll check on you again in a bit."
Applejack says: "Just checkin' in on you again!"
Applejack says: "Need anythin' now?"
Applejack says: "How 'bout now?"
Applejack says: "Need another blanket?"
Applejack says: "Did I hear a cough?"
Applejack says: "Want a glass of water?"
Applejack says: "Look at you, dozin' so peaceful-like."
Applejack says: "Here I am, checkin' up on you every five seconds, and you're totally fine."
Applejack says: "Maybe you don't need me frettin' over you all the time."
Scootaloo says: "Wow, Apple Bloom will be so glad to hear that!"
Applejack says: "Huh?"
Applejack says: "Scootaloo?"
Scootaloo says: "Uh, um, n-no."
Applejack says: "Sweetie Belle?"
Applejack says: "But..."
Applejack says: "where's Apple Bloom?"
Applejack says: "She's not here!"
Applejack says: "She could be anywhere!"
Applejack says: "She could be lost, cold, hungry, itchy, stuffed up, needin' to go to the bathroom!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Don't worry, we know exactly where she is."
Scootaloo says: "Yeah, she's making your pie delivery."
Applejack says: "What?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "No!"
Applejack says: "Didn't she hear how difficult and dangerous it was?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "I may never see my little sister again!"
Applejack says: "Okay, Rarity's on her way here to look after you two."
Applejack says: "Now tell me, did Apple Bloom at least bring flameproof boots?"
Applejack says: "A lion tamer's chair?"
Applejack says: "A snake charmin' flute?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "A hunk of ricotta?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "Okay, maybe there's still time to catch her before she gets there."
Applejack says: "When did she leave?"
Sweetie Belle says: "It must've been hours ago."
Applejack says: "Oh, no!"
Apple Bloom says: "Well, now at least I can see."
Chimera's tiger head says: "I'd stay where you are."
Chimera's tiger head says: "This is the only safe spot around here."
Apple Bloom says: "It don't look so safe to me."
Chimera's tiger head says: "Oh, we just mean from the flames."
Chimera's goat head says: "Yeah, not from us."
Chimera's snake head says: "What was that?"
Chimera's snake head says: "Ah, can you guysss ssspeak up?"
Chimera's tiger head says: "I was about to tell our guest how we haven't eaten in days."
Chimera's goat head says: "My sisters and I can never agree on what to eat."
Chimera's snake head says: "Excccept..."
Chimera's snake head says: "pie."
Apple Bloom says: "Well, unfortunately, I gotta get these pies to a town on the other side of the swamp, so, uh..."
Chimera's tiger head says: "Oh, you don't have to worry about that."
Chimera's goat head says: "Yeah, you don't have to worry about anything anymore."
Chimera's snake head says: "Because we're going to have our apple pie with a ssside of filly filet."
Apple Bloom says: "You don't say."
Chimera's tiger head says: "Now, sisters, on three!"
Chimera's tiger head says: "One!"
Chimera's goat head says: "Two!"
Chimera's snake head says: "Three!"
Apple Bloom says: "No!"
Chimera's tiger head says: "Where do you think you're going?"
Apple Bloom says: "Yaaah!"
Chimera's tiger head says: "Where are the pies?!"
Chimera's tiger head says: "!"
Chimera's snake head says: "They're not back here."
Chimera's goat head says: "This is your fault!"
Chimera's goat head says: "You think you've always got to be in charge!"
Chimera's tiger head says: "You're lucky, you know?"
Chimera's tiger head says: "You've got no idea what it's like to have a sister constantly looking over your shoulder!"
Apple Bloom says: "Uh, actually..."
Chimera's goat head says: "Let's try listening to me for a change!"
Chimera's goat head says: "And I say, if there are no pies, let's settle for the filly filet!"
Chimera's snake head says: "Any lassst wordsss?"
Apple Bloom says: "I really wish my sister were here!"
Applejack says: "Hang on, Apple Bloom!"
Applejack says: "I'm a-comin'!"
Chimera's tiger head says: "Get her!"
goat head says: "Get her!"
Chimera's goat head says: "Hey!"
Chimera's goat head says: "I thought I was in charge now!"
Applejack says: "Howdy!"
Chimera's goat head says: "Mm, ricotta!"
Applejack says: "Let's go!"
Applejack says: "Are you okay?"
Apple Bloom says: "Thanks to you."
Applejack says: "I told you you need your big sister lookin' after you!"
Applejack says: "I'm just glad this wasn't a whole lot worse."
Applejack says: "I mean, sure we lost the cart and all the pies, but at least you're—"
Applejack says: "huh, the cart!"
Applejack says: "And all the pies!"
Applejack says: "You actually got them all the way up here?"
Applejack says: "In the dark?"
Applejack says: "Through the Flame Geyser Swamp?"
Applejack says: "Past that monster?"
Applejack says: "..."
Applejack says: "By yourself?"
Apple Bloom says: "Well..."
Apple Bloom says: "yeah."
Applejack says: "Huh, wow."
Applejack says: "That's mighty impressive!"
Applejack says: "Anypony who can do that on her own, well, she don't need somepony like me babyin' her."
"Duce Switchell" says: "Mm-hm!"
"Duce Switchell" says: "Andouille!"
"Duce Switchell" says: "This pie's even tastier than my momma's swamp water casserole!"
Cajun ponies cheering.
"Duce Switchell" says: "Aw, now, momma, don't be like that."
Applejack says: "Just remember, you fellas wouldn't be enjoyin' these pies if it weren't for my sister."
Apple Bloom says: "And my sister!"
Applejack says: "But this don't change the fact that tryin' to make this delivery on your own was a plumb crazy thing to do!"
Apple Bloom says: "I know..."
Applejack says: "I bet Granny Smith grounds you for a month for sneakin' out!"
Applejack says: "And if Big Mac, Granny Smith 'n I ever have to be away for the day again..."
Applejack says: "I would totally trust you to stay home and take care of things on your own."
Applejack says: "I guess I did get a little carried away watchin' over you, and if you hadn't snuck out like you did, maybe I wouldn't have figured that out."
Apple Bloom says: "Yes!"
Apple Bloom says: "Now that is the kind of 'looking after me' that I can definitely appreciate!"
Apple Bloom says: "So..."
Apple Bloom says: "we're good?"
Applejack says: "Little sister, we're always good."
