Fluttershy says: "Mm-hmm."
Fluttershy says: "Mm-hmm."
Fluttershy says: "Oh."
Fluttershy says: "Antoine believes what he eats is his business."
Fluttershy says: "Do other predators feel that way, too?"
Fluttershy says: "Would anyprey like to respond?"
Fluttershy says: "Muriel, does it bother you when Antoine tries to eat you?"
Fluttershy says: "Just because you're on opposite ends of the food chain doesn't mean you can't work—"
Fluttershy says: "Huh?"
Fluttershy says: "It doesn't mean you can't..."
Fluttershy says: "It doesn't mean you can't work togeth—"
Fluttershy says: "Oh!"
Fluttershy says: "I'm sorry, but the more you distract everyone, the longer this will take."
Fluttershy says: "I am listening to you."
Fluttershy says: "But if you really want to be heard, you should join our predator/prey support group."
Fluttershy says: "Then you can talk to everyone here."
Fluttershy says: "You could teach all these hungry predators the delights of a carrot-based cuisine."
Fluttershy says: "Sorry, everyone."
Fluttershy says: "I think somebunny just wants a little attention."
Fluttershy says: "Now, since we all need to get along, what if all predators promise to only eat vegetables while staying at the sanctuary?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, Sandra, you can do it."
Fluttershy says: "Angel, Sandra, wait!"
Dr. Fauna says: "It might look like chaos, but Fluttershy makes it work, even with Angel running around."
Zecora says: "Ohhhh."
Zecora says: "Perhaps I can help those two get along before something here can go terribly wrong."
Dr. Fauna says: "Zecora found this little guy and brought him to my office."
Dr. Fauna says: "But I thought he might do better at the sanctuary."
Zecora says: "Bringing him here seemed the right thing to do."
Zecora says: "I've never seen geckos breathe smoke though."
Zecora says: "Have you?"
Fluttershy says: "Ooh."
Fluttershy says: "I certainly haven't."
Dr. Fauna says: "I thought we could take a look at his diet."
Dr. Fauna says: "Plus, it's about time for me to give all the animals here a checkup."
Fluttershy says: "That's a wonderful idea."
Fluttershy says: "If we really want to know what's going on, we need to make sure the problem isn't your food."
Fluttershy says: "I wouldn't worry too much."
Fluttershy says: "It's probably just something he's been eating."
Fluttershy says: "Oh."
Fluttershy says: "Um, is there anything else we can do for you?"
Zecora says: "Ahhh."
Zecora says: "Seeing what you two do, the real question is – can I help you?"
Fluttershy says: "You mean me and Angel?"
Zecora says: "Mm-hmm."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, he's fine!"
Fluttershy says: "We're fine!"
Fluttershy says: "I..."
Fluttershy says: "I just don't always have time to indulge him."
Fluttershy says: "But we're best friends!"
Zecora says: "Even the best of friends need help from time to time."
Zecora says: "Come visit me in my hut, should you change your mind."
Fluttershy says: "Okay, thanks!"
Fluttershy says: "But Angel and I are great!"
Dr. Fauna says: "Oh, goodness, Fluttershy."
Dr. Fauna says: "Is this the list of what you do every day?"
Dr. Fauna says: "How do you find time for anything else?"
Fluttershy says: "Between here and teaching at the school, I'm not sure I do."
Fluttershy says: "You're gonna love it here, little gecko."
Fluttershy says: "What is it?"
Fluttershy says: "Not fluffy enough?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, sorry."
Fluttershy says: "We need to see if your food is causing your issue."
Fluttershy says: "Huh?"
Fluttershy says: "Hmm."
Fluttershy says: "Not now, Angel."
Fluttershy says: "There's snake treats made to look like chocolate chip cookies."
Fluttershy says: "They're vegan."
Fluttershy says: "Pinkie Pie made a whole jar of them."
Fluttershy says: "They're all yours if you promise."
Fluttershy says: "No more trying to eat Muriel the baby elephant."
Fluttershy says: "No, Angel."
Fluttershy says: "I have too much to do."
Dr. Fauna says: "Oh, careful, girl."
Dr. Fauna says: "That neck is still pretty sore."
Fluttershy says: "Don't forget to shift your weight, Scout!"
Dr. Fauna says: "What does she want?"
Fluttershy says: "Her neck is feeling better, but a massage every day for the next week wouldn't hurt."
Fluttershy says: "I'll add it to my list."
Fluttershy says: "Angel!"
Fluttershy says: "Listen to you for once?"
Fluttershy says: "Just what exactly is that supposed to mean?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Come back!"
Fluttershy says: "I-I meant tell me, not—"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Dr. Fauna says: "Well, whatever it is, you're the only one he can tell about it."
Dr. Fauna says: "Little fella just wants you all to himself."
Fluttershy says: "Unfortunately, that's not an option."
Dr. Fauna says: "Aw, he's not causing any real trouble."
Dr. Fauna says: "Aah!"
Dr. Fauna says: "Other than that, possibly."
Dr. Fauna says: "Or that."
Dr. Fauna says: "I'll just stop talking."
Fluttershy says: "I'll take care of it."
Fluttershy says: "I hope this is important, Angel."
Fluttershy says: "I barely made a dent in my to-do list for today."
Fluttershy says: "Concentrated carrot extract?"
Fluttershy says: "That's for reviving energy-sapped herbivores."
Fluttershy says: "Are you feeling rundown?"
Fluttershy says: "You just like the taste?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Ugh!"
Fluttershy says: "Angel, that extract is in short supply!"
Fluttershy says: "What's gotten into you?"
Fluttershy says: "Every day this week, you've been causing trouble when I have work to do!"
Fluttershy says: "Of course I know you can't talk to anypony else."
Fluttershy says: "But that's not my fault."
Fluttershy says: "I have responsibilities!"
Fluttershy says: "You're right."
Fluttershy says: "We can't go on like this."
Fluttershy says: "I guess we do need to see Zecora for help."
Zecora says: "No need to sit and silently stew."
Zecora says: "Tell each other what's bothering you."
Fluttershy says: "He's so impatient, even when he knows I have work to do."
Fluttershy says: "Well, that's not true."
Fluttershy says: "We talk all the time."
Fluttershy says: "Of course talking at the sanctuary counts."
Fluttershy says: "That's where I am when I don't have a class to teach."
Fluttershy says: "What do you mean that's the problem?"
Fluttershy says: "You feel like I'm the only pony you can talk to, and all I do is ignore you?"
Fluttershy says: "Well, I feel like you don't care about my responsibilities."
Fluttershy says: "Um, as you can see, we're kind of at an impasse."
Zecora says: "Ahhh, such luck, your coming here indeed."
Zecora says: "Behold, the antidote you need."
Fluttershy says: "Is this what you meant by "help us"?"
Zecora says: "When trouble brews between you two, turning sister against brother, true understanding is what's due."
Zecora says: "Each must come to know the other."
Zecora says: "There's no time to waste."
Zecora says: "Go directly home."
Zecora says: "But you both must taste when you're finally alone."
Fluttershy says: "Not yet, Angel."
Fluttershy says: "Zecora told us to take it together when we got home."
Fluttershy says: "Hmm."
Fluttershy says: "I suppose we could dust off the old picnic blanket."
Fluttershy says: "It'll be just like old times."
Fluttershy says: "We'll drink the potion and settle in for a nice tea party."
Fluttershy says: "I can barely remember the last time we did that."
Fluttershy says: "I've been so busy at the sanctuary."
Fluttershy says: "Though I really need to keep an eye on Zecora's gecko, and I haven't finished any of today's chores."
Fluttershy says: "If I don't, the animals won't get the care they need."
Fluttershy says: "Ohh."
Fluttershy says: "Maybe we should just save the potion until af—"
Fluttershy says: "Angel!"
Fluttershy says: "Zecora said to go home first!"
Fluttershy says: "I know she said we have to take it together, so..."
Fluttershy says: "I guess I have to."
Fluttershy says: "I wonder what it's gonna doooo—"
Angel says: "—"
Angel says: "whooooaaaa!"
Angel says: "Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, hang on, hold up!"
Angel says: "Am I a pony?"
Angel says: "Why am I a pony?!"
Angel says: "!"
Angel says: "Question."
Angel says: "Did we switch bodies?"
Angel says: "Whoa!"
Angel says: "Gah!"
Angel says: "Guh!"
Angel says: "Whoooaaa-whoa-whoa!"
Angel says: "Seriously?"
Angel says: "I'm a pony?"
Angel says: "La-la-la-la!"
Angel says: "Talking is so cool."
Angel says: "Do you think this is what Zecora meant to happen?"
Angel says: "How are you gonna do your chores?!"
Angel says: "!"
Angel says: "Really?"
Angel says: "That's what you're worried about?"
Angel says: "..."
Angel says: "and so do you!"
Angel says: "Rubber baby buggy bumpers!"
Angel says: "Toy boat, toy boat, toy bo—"
Angel says: "Aah!"
Angel says: "Aw, come on!"
Angel says: "I am so too listening!"
Angel says: "Quit being so bossy because—"
Angel says: "!"
Angel says: "Are there carrots around here?"
Angel says: "You think Zecora gave us the wrong potion, so you're gonna go to her hut in the forest and get something to switch us back?"
Angel says: "All by yourself?"
Angel says: "You really don't know what it's like being a bunny."
Angel says: "Good luck with that!"
Angel says: "I'm gonna go find those carrots!"
Angel says: "I need to finish your chores?"
Angel says: "I don't work for you."
Angel says: "And caring about other animals is a "you" thing."
Angel says: "The Stare?!"
Angel says: "!"
Angel says: "You can still do that?"
Angel says: "Ugh!"
Angel says: "No fair making me do your bidding against my will!"
Angel says: "All right!"
Angel says: "I'll go do your lame chores while you go see Zecora."
Angel says: "Anypony know where that useless list of Fluttershy's chores is?"
Dr. Fauna says: "Hey, Fluttershy!"
Dr. Fauna says: "I was starting to wonder if you'd make it back."
Angel says: "Fluttershy!"
Angel says: "Oh!"
Angel says: "Yeah!"
Angel says: "Uh, that's me!"
Angel says: "Definitely Fluttershy!"
Angel says: "A hundred percent!"
Dr. Fauna says: "Uh, okay."
Angel says: "See how shy I am?"
Angel says: "Hmm?"
Angel says: "I talk to animals, I want to marry Discord—"
Dr. Fauna says: "Your list is over there."
Angel says: "Oh, yeah."
Angel says: "There's my good old list of chores that I will absolutely not rush through because I definitely do not have better things to do."
Angel says: "Well, well, well."
Angel says: "Remember me?"
Spike says: "I hope the gem tart stall is still there again."
Spike says: "I could use a snack!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You nearly bought every tart they had last time, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can't imagine they wouldn't show up when there's a great customer like you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, hi, Angel."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's going on?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Do you know what he's trying to say?"
Spike says: "Nope."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sorry, Angel."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You should probably find Fluttershy."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If I see her, I'll let her know you're looking for her."
Angel says: "And we're gonna keep at it until you start to develop a taste for it!"
Angel says: "Uh..."
Angel says: ""Check Muriel's trunk."
Angel says: "Eh, seems fine to me."
Angel says: "As long as we don't need those keys."
Angel says: "Anyway, let's see."
Angel says: ""Massage Clementine's neck."
Angel says: ""Get Scout to switch legs"?"
Angel says: "Eh, probably best not to wake him."
Angel says: "Did the thing with the thing, yadda-yadda-yadda, animals, animals, animals..."
Angel says: "All that's left is..."
Angel says: ""Monitor Zecora's gecko until bedtime"?"
Angel says: "All right, dude."
Angel says: "How about we do bedtime now?"
Angel says: "Yeah, eating makes me tired, too."
Angel says: "Which reminds me."
Angel says: "There's some carrot extract with my name on it."
Angel says: "Okay!"
Angel says: "Let's get you fed and off to dreamland!"
Angel says: "What do you eat anyway?"
Angel says: "What do you say, snake?"
Angel says: "Can you find something else to eat if I borrow those cookies for my friend here?"
Angel says: "Eh, I'm sure that's normal."
Angel says: "There you go."
Angel says: "Problem solved."
Angel says: "I don't see what's so hard about this job."
Angel says: "Fluttershy is such a whiner."
Zecora says: "Quite a day, my fuzzy friend."
Zecora says: "Did things work out for you in the end?"
Zecora says: "I'm..."
Zecora says: "sorry, dear bunny, that things seem so grave."
Zecora says: "But I don't understand when you sign and wave."
Zecora says: "A single link to all the world."
Zecora says: "Only one in all the land."
Zecora says: "How special she must be to you, the one who understands."
Zecora says: "Perhaps if you explain what you wanted to some pony who understood."
Zecora says: "If you truly felt heard and valued, all would return to good."
Zecora says: "And if you were to both apologize, having learned this little lesson, I imagine that might bring an end to the friendship therapy session."
Dr. Fauna says: "Fluttershy?"
Dr. Fauna says: "Do you mind helping me look for Muriel the baby elephant?"
Angel says: "Oh, she's having dinner with Antoine."
Dr. Fauna says: "Antoine the python?!"
Dr. Fauna says: "!"
Angel says: "It was on the list."
Angel says: ""Remember – Antoine wants to have Muriel over for dinner."
Dr. Fauna says: "Not OVER for dinner!"
Dr. Fauna says: "He wants to have her FOR dinner!"
Angel says: "Wait."
Angel says: "What?!"
Angel says: "!"
Dr. Fauna says: "Bad snake!"
Dr. Fauna says: "Open your mouth this instant, mister!"
Dr. Fauna says: "Aah!"
Dr. Fauna says: "What is going on?!"
Dr. Fauna says: "!"
Dr. Fauna says: "You did all the chores on your list!"
Dr. Fauna says: "Huh?!"
Dr. Fauna says: "!"
Dr. Fauna says: "Didn't you?!"
Dr. Fauna says: "!"
Angel says: "Well, technically I did 'em, kind of."
Angel says: "But more technically, it's not my list."
Dr. Fauna says: "You wrote it!"
Angel says: "Did I though?"
Dr. Fauna says: "What's gotten into you?!"
Dr. Fauna says: "!"
Angel says: "You do not want to know."
Dr. Fauna says: "Huh?"
Dr. Fauna says: "Angel?"
Angel says: "What's wrong with her—"
Angel says: "h-him?!"
Angel says: "!"
Angel says: "What happened?"
Dr. Fauna says: "He's exhausted!"
Dr. Fauna says: "Fluttershy!"
Dr. Fauna says: "I need a jar of concentrated carrot extract!"
Dr. Fauna says: "Stat!"
Angel says: "Ah!"
Angel says: "It's locked in the supply room!"
Dr. Fauna says: "Where are your keys?!"
Dr. Fauna says: "!"
Angel says: "Uhhh..."
Angel says: "Any ideas how to get the keys out of the elephant that's inside the snake?"
Angel says: "Okay, point taken."
Angel says: "And I totally deserve it."
Angel says: "I did not provide you with the care that Fluttershy would."
Angel says: "But now you know what it's like not to get the level of attention to which you've become accustomed!"
Angel says: "The point is..."
Angel says: "Fluttershy is trapped in my bunny body."
Angel says: "If we don't help her, maybe none of us will get her attention!"
Angel says: "I get that you don't want to help me."
Angel says: "But don't you want to help her?"
Angel says: "Here goes nothin'."
Angel says: "Now we just need to get those keys out of there."
Angel says: "Nice one, snake."
Angel says: "I guess Fluttershy was right."
Angel says: "Predators and prey can work together."
Angel says: "This place is so..."
Angel says: "much..."
Angel says: "work!"
Dr. Fauna says: "Oh, I know."
Dr. Fauna says: "I have no clue how you do it all."
Dr. Fauna says: "But we are so grateful."
Angel says: "I can't believe she does this every day!"
Angel says: "I just wish I could tell her myself."
Dr. Fauna says: "What?"
Angel says: "You're awake!"
Angel says: "It was so hard getting to Zecora's hut?"
Angel says: "And impossible getting back?"
Angel says: "You can't believe I survive like this?"
Angel says: "Well, I can't believe you work here every day!"
Angel says: "These animals are crazy!"
Angel says: "No wonder you don't have time for me."
Angel says: "My life is hard?"
Angel says: "No, your life is hard!"
Angel says: "You never appreciated me?"
Angel says: "No!"
Angel says: "I never appreciated you!"
Angel says: "You're sorry?"
Angel says: "I'm sorry, too!"
Angel says: "Come here, you little bunny who's a pony who's a bunny!"
Angel says: "Ooh!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, my goodness!"
Fluttershy says: "I'm back!"
Fluttershy says: "I'm a pony again!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, Angel."
Fluttershy says: "I promise to always make time for you from now on."
Fluttershy says: "What do you mean maybe I won't have to?"
Fluttershy says: "You want to do what?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Fluttershy says: ""And that's when I realized Fluttershy doesn't have to be the only one I talk to."
Fluttershy says: "I can come here and talk to all of you."
Fluttershy says: "And now that I know how much work goes into this place, I suppose I can kinda sorta help out every now and then."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, Angel."
Fluttershy says: "That is so sweet."
Fluttershy says: "But now that I know what you go through every day, I understand why your time with me is so important."
Fluttershy says: "I promise to always make time for you."
Dr. Fauna says: "Turns out your friend here doesn't have a problem at all."
Dr. Fauna says: "He isn't a gecko."
Dr. Fauna says: "He's a fire lizard."
Dr. Fauna says: "I forgot that before they get their flame, it's hard to tell them apart."
Zecora says: "I'm glad to discover where the source of it lies, or the fire that he breathes would be quite the surprise."
Dr. Fauna says: "Speaking of surprises, can you please never do that again?!"
Dr. Fauna says: "!"
