Spike says: "Try again, Twi, you can do it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Phew, this spell's a toughie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But I feel lucky this time!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "One, two..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hi!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nnnnnng!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie, why'd you do that?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "'Cause hugs are funneriffic, especially when you throw one around a friend."
Pinkie Pie says: "Whatcha doin'?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Trying to turn that apple into an orange!"
Spike says: "But you kinda threw her aim off..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wheee!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What a cute orange birdie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Do me next, Twilight!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Do me, do me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooooh, Rarity, wanna see Twilight turn me into an orange?"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's gonna be funna-fun-fuuun!"
Rarity says: "As fun as creating this haute couture ensemble that I just finished making?"
Rarity says: "Delightful, non?"
Pinkie Pie says: "This is terrible!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You had total-awesome-amazing fun and I missed out on it?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Neh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What if there's more awesome amazing fun with friends happening somewhere in Ponyville right now that I'm missing out on too?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Spike says: "We weren't going to turn her into an orange!"
Spike says: "I swear!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, Rainbow Dash, whatcha doing?"
Rainbow Dash says: "This punk cloud got so heavy it's making fog."
Rainbow Dash says: "Figure I'll thin this bad boy out so it floats back up."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oooh, fun!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wheeeeee!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Gotta go!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, thanks, Pinkie..."
Rainbow Dash says: "?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, Applejack!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That looks like fun, can I join you?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wheee!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Next time I'll pull you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Fluttershy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "fun?"
Fluttershy says: "Not especially."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, good."
Pinkie Pie says: "Fun..."
Pinkie Pie says: "is hard..."
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Feeling better, Pinkie?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Abso-tutely-lutely!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Thanks for letting me rest in your butterfly grove while I get my Pinkie strength back!"
Fluttershy says: "What are friends for?"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's just the thing!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I've got so many wonderful friends having fun in every last corner of Ponyville, I can't figure out how to keep up with it all!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's driving me even more coco-loco than usual!"
Fluttershy says: "I can promise to not do anything fun at all if that would help."
Pinkie Pie says: "You are such a good friend."
Applejack says: "There you are, Pinkie."
Applejack says: "Been lookin' everywhere for ya, girl."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, Pinkie."
Rainbow Dash says: "Got something fun planned this afternoon thought you might wanna know about."
Applejack says: "Heh."
Applejack says: "Well, I'll be an apple crisp."
Applejack says: "I'm here for the same reason."
Pinkie Pie says: "This is perfect!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Everyone will now bring their fun to me."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ha, this'll solve everything!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Why didn't I think of that?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Actually, what I meant is after I'm done whipping up today's weather, I'll be chilling by the lake catching some rays."
Rainbow Dash says: "Wanna hang?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I am so there."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wheee."
Applejack says: "And my family's havin' a barn-raisin' this afternoon at Sweet Apple Acres."
Pinkie Pie says: "And I'm also so there."
Pinkie Pie says: "Whee, whee."
Rainbow Dash says: "But..."
Rainbow Dash says: "that's when I'll be at the swimming hole."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ah, well, doesn't matter."
Rainbow Dash says: "Whichever one you choose is okay with me."
Applejack says: "Me too."
Pinkie Pie says: "Choose?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "One, two..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What in the wide, wide world of Equestria are you doing now?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Timing myself galloping back and forth between the swimming hole and Sweet Apple Acres."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm trying to cut down my time so if Rainbow Dash dives off the swing, I can get to Sweet Apple Acres to help with the barn raising, and then be back in time to see Rainbow Dash hit the water after doing a double flip!"
Pinkie Pie says: "If I can cut my time by only twenty minutes, I'm good."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Pinkie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm afraid no matter how hard you try, the only way to pull something like that off is if there's more of you to go around."
Pinkie Pie says: "That's it, Twilight!"
Pinkie Pie says: "The legend of the Mirror Pool!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Legend of the who-what now?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie!"
Spike says: "Does this mean practice is over?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Of course not!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Back to work."
Pinkie Pie says: "Seems like hardly anypony's been here in ages."
Pinkie Pie says: "I hope I'm remembering the rhymes right from my Nana Pinkie's story."
Pinkie Pie says: ""Where the brambles are thickest, there you will find a pond beyond the most twisted of vines!"
Pinkie Pie says: ""  What was that?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, I heard a voice!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hehe."
Pinkie Pie says: "It was me."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ouch!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Stop scratching me up, you brambles, and– Whoooaaa!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, and there's that voice again!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Tsk, tsk, tsk."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ah Pinkie, you have got to stop talking to yourself."
Pinkie Pie says: "Starting..."
Pinkie Pie says: "now."
Pinkie Pie says: ""And into her own reflection she stared, uh, yearning for one whose reflection she shared, and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Wheee-heee!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wow, the legend is true."
Pinkie Pie says: "It really worked!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay, wait."
Pinkie Pie says: "I promised not talk to myself anymore."
Pinkie Pie says: "I should say something to her."
Pinkie Pie says: "Or..."
Pinkie Pie says: "would that still be talking to myself?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Excuse me, me?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Can I have a word with you?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, I mean, me?"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Fun?!"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "!"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Did somebody say fun?"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Where?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I did, over here!"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "I thought someone said something about fun!"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Where is it?"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Over here?"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Over here?"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "I don't see it!"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Where is it?"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Where is it?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoa, calm yourself, Pinkie, there's loads of fun to be had in Ponyville with my girls!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Trot on over back to Ponyville with me and I'll tell you all about 'em."
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "And then there's Rarity."
Pinkie Pie says: "She's the one with all the fancy clothes and ribbons and stuff!"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Is this Ponyville?"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Where's the fun?"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Where's the fun?"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's that-away!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait, come back!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't forget to meet me back here to tell me everything about everything, like I was there myself!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Because I'm you and, and you're me, and– Oh, my gosh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "This is the greatest plan ever!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Now, off to double my fun!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Let's rock this pool, ponies!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whee!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Coming in, Dashie?"
Pinkie Pie says: "The water's great, it's totally wet and everything!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I don't know..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Cloud busting was tougher work than usual today."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm kind of exhausted."
Pinkie Pie says: "That's fine, you relax."
Pinkie Pie says: "At least we'll still be together!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Glad you made it, Pinkie."
Rainbow Dash says: "I thought you maybe went to Applejack's, instead."
Pinkie Pie says: "I did."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh."
Rainbow Dash says: "The barn up yet?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I have no idea."
Rainbow Dash says: "But I thought you said you were just at Applejack's."
Pinkie Pie says: "Actually, I'm probably still on my way there now!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whee!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, Pinkie Pie, I'm so glad you wandered by."
Fluttershy says: "I know I promised not to have any fun today, but, oh, I couldn't help myself."
Fluttershy says: "All of my critter friends wanted a picnic, and I couldn't disappoint them."
Fluttershy says: "Come join us."
Fluttershy says: "We have plenty of hay juice and marmalade to go around, don't we, critters?"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Wait, but that sounds super fun!"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Oh, but Applejohn sounds super fun too!"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Uh, and, and I can't do one without missing out on the other!"
Fluttershy says: "Who's Applejohn?"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Two fun things at once?"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "But which, which?"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Oh, can't decide..."
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Trouble breathing..."
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Walls closing in!"
Fluttershy says: "Walls?"
Fluttershy says: "But we're outside."
Fluttershy says: "Goodness."
Fluttershy says: "Was it something I said?"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Yes!"
Fluttershy says: "Huh?"
Pinkie Pie says: "So you see, that's how I'm able to have fun in two places at once."
Rainbow Dash says: "Duplicates of you, huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh, yeah, sure, Pinkie."
Rainbow Dash says: "Look, I was just gearing up to catch some Z's, so, uh..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Gotcha."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'll have the rest of my fun really quietly."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wheeeee..."
Rainbow Dash says: "How'd you do that?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Just trying to show a little consideration for my sleepy friend."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh, ooh, gotta run."
Pinkie Pie says: "Looks like I'm trying to get my attention."
Pinkie Pie says: "Excuse me."
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "And me."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh, ooh, tell me all about it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Did they pull the walls of the barn up slow or fast?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Maybe slow to medium fast, somewhere in that range?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh, did you get ice cream?"
Pinkie Pie says: "What kinds did they have?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Banana brickle?"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "I didn't make it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Fluttershy."
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Yeah, her."
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "She offered something else fun for me to do!"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "A picnic, with cute little animals!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Aw, how could you say no to that?"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "That's what I'm saying!"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Then I would've missed the super fun thing with Applesauce!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Applejack."
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "So I didn't do anything fun at all!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Aw, my poor poor me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "There, there."
Pinkie Pie says: "Tell me what, we just need a couple more Pinkie Pies."
Pinkie Pie says: "Easy peasy."
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Really?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Come on, would I lie to me?"
Pinkie Pie says: ""..."
Pinkie Pie 2 says: ""..."
Pinkie Pie says: "and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!"
Pinkie Pie 2 says: "Look, a double me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I think you mean a double-double me."
Pinkie Pie says: "Plus another double-double me, which makes two double-double mes, or a double-double-double me, if you will."
Pinkie Pie 3 says: "Did somebody say fun?"
Pinkie Pie 3 says: "Where?"
Pinkie Pie 3 says: "Fun fun fun fun fun!"
Pinkie Pies 2 says: "Fun!"
3 says: "Fun!"
4 says: "Fun!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Now Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy are covered, plus one extra Pinkie Pie in case we get an extra invite from somepony else."
Pinkie Pie says: "Perfect!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay, let's go!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, Pinkies!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yoo-hoo!"
Pinkie Pies 2 says: ""..."
3 says: ""..."
4 says: ""..."
Pinkie Pies 2 says: "and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!"
3 says: "and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!"
4 says: "and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay, good enough."
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: ""..."
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "not to be scared, at the prospect of being doubly mared!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What in the name of pink?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Knock it off!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Fun!"
Pinkie Pie says: "To Ponyville, everyone!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Follow me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yes, it's fun there."
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Fun!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay, between the bunch of us, we should have every nook and cranny of fun in Ponyville covered at all times."
Pinkie Pie says: "An unprecedented and massive undertaking!"
Pinkie Pie says: "But first, a pop quiz on the names I taught you!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Applejack!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Fluttershy!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Pinkie Pie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Excellent."
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay, let's get on with this, folks."
Pinkie Pie says: "Fan out on three."
Pinkie Pie says: "Eh, good enough."
Pinkie Pie says: "La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, whee!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wow!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie Pie wasn't kidding about the duplicates!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Except now there's triplicates..."
Rainbow Dash says: "and quadruplicates!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Dash is gonna love this!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Aw, if I push her around on this floaty thing, it'll be fun and relaxing!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh-oh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "No more Pinkies!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I can't take it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Gosh, uh..."
Pinkie Pie says: "I wonder what fun they're having raising the barn at Applejack's right now!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Maybe I'd better go check!"
Pinkie duplicates shouting "Fun!".
Applejack says: "No!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, phew!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Looks like I haven't missed a thing!"
Applejack says: "I wanna know right now where all you Pinkies came from, so I can find out who's responsible for y'all ruinin' our barn raisin'!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, you look pretty busy right now, so  maybe we should talk a little later?"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Fun!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Fun!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Fun!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Fun!"
Applejack says: "Y'all come back here and clean up after yourselves this instant!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh no, what have I done, what have I done?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "My poor friends..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, everypony, please, calm down!"
Rarity says: "Calm down?"
Rarity says: "I just had a Pinkie hurricane raging through my shop!"
Fluttershy says: "And they trashed our critter picnic!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Please, everypony, hang on while I try to figure something out!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Come on, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've gotta try to remember the name of that legend she mentioned."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Aha, here it is!"
Twilight Sparkle says: ""The legend of the Mirror Pond"..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It describes a spell I can use to send them back where they came from!"
Spike says: "That's perfect!"
Spike says: "Let's go!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But there's a catch."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If I can't figure out which one's the real Pinkie, I might send her back by mistake!"
Spike says: "Well, we'll just have to figure out who the real one is then."
Spike says: "Shouldn't be too hard."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Does anypony here know how we can tell the real Pinkie Pie from all the rest of them?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Twilight!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I have to talk to you, I need your help!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Excuse me, whoever you are, but I'm not talking to any of you Pinkies unless you're the real Pinkie."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, but, but I am the real Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate says: "No, you're not!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate says: "I'm the real Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate 2 says: "I'm the real Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate 3 says: "No, I'm the real Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate 4 says: "I'm the real Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate 5 says: "No, I'm the real Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate 6 says: "I'm the real Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Fun!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Fun!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Fun!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Fun!"
Applejack says: "How in tarnation are we supposed to tell which is the real Pinkie?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I have no idea."
Pinkie Pie says: "Me either."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ohh..."
Pinkie Pie says: "We've all got the same adorable tails, we've all got the same adorable manes, we've all got the same adorable hooves!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Which one of us is the real Pinkie?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I haven't the slightest clue!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And if I can't tell us apart..."
Pinkie Pie says: "who can?"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Fun!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Fun!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Fun!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Fun!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh, this is hopeless!"
Spike says: "Maybe that one's the real Pinkie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Please."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The real Pinkie Pie never sat that long in one place her whole life!"
Spike says: "I'm gonna go ask."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Of course she's gonna say she's the real Pinkie!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "They all do!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're wasting your time."
Spike says: "So lemme guess."
Spike says: "You're the real Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie says: "Heck if I know."
Pinkie Pie says: "Could be any one of us if you ask me."
Pinkie Pie says: "And if I said I was the real Pinkie, you wouldn't even believe me anyway."
Pinkie Pie says: "So just leave me alone."
Pinkie Pie says: "I've got some important poking the ground with my hoof to do."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Spike, how're we gonna do this?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can't risk sending the real Pinkie back into the pond!"
Spike says: "I miss the real Pinkie."
Pinkie Pie says: "I bet she misses you too."
Pinkie Pie says: "Bet she'd do just about anything to get to be with her friends again."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What if you gave them a test?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pick something really hard for a Pinkie to do, something not fun at all!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Any Pinkie that can't do it goes back into the pond."
Pinkie Pie says: "But whoever wants to stay the most, that must be the real Pinkie!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You know, that's not a bad idea."
Pinkie Pie says: "This is great!"
Pinkie Pie says: "If I pass, I get to be with my friends again!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've been looking all over for you ponies."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are you all doing here?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Fluttershy spoke with the woodland critters, and they've agreed to take us into their home 'til the Pinkie storm dies down."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You guys, we're gonna fix this."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And I know exactly how."
Fluttershy says: "Are we gonna lose our real Pinkie Pie?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't think so."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now come along."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've already got Applejack and her family rounding up all the Pinkies."
Applejack says: "Hyah, ya Pinkies!"
Applejack says: "Hyah!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate says: "Ooh, they wanna play chase!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate says: "This is fun, too!"
Applejack says: "Oh, give it a rest."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Welcome, Pinkies, welcome."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Please have a seat and make yourselves comfortable."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sit down!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Better."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now, I suppose you're all wondering why I've gathered you all here today."
Pinkie Pie Duplicate says: "For fun?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, just the opposite actually."
Rainbow Dash says: "Wait up, I got one more!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Found this one poking at the ground with her hoof, drawing frowny faces."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Have her come sit with the others."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkies, you've been brought here to take a test."
Pinkie Pie Duplicates says: "Awww!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Don't worry, it's a simple test, about as simple as they come, and whoever passes gets to stay."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Curtain, please."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The test..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "will be watching paint dry!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "On your mark, get set, go!"
Spike says: "Ooh, this is so exciting!"
Spike says: "Okay, maybe not that exciting."
Pinkie Pie Duplicate says: "Oh, hey, look at the birdie!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate says: "Watch me bounce and touch the ceiling!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate says: "Is that..."
Pinkie Pie Duplicate says: "is that a frog crossed with an orange?"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate 2 says: "Cool!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate 3 says: "Where?"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate says: "Look what I can do with my hooves!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate says: "Betcha can't make a face crazier than..."
Pinkie Pie Duplicate says: "this!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh, I can't take it anymore!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Somepony's making balloon animals!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate says: "What?"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate says: "Where?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie, you can look away now."
Pinkie Pie says: "I passed?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You passed."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're the only Pinkie who kept staring at the wall."
Pinkie Pie says: "I had to."
Pinkie Pie says: "I just had to."
Pinkie Pie says: "I couldn't leave my friends, I just couldn't."
Pinkie Pie says: "But I guess sometimes I will have to choose between them."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I knew you'd be up to the challenge."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Or am I?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah, I'm pretty sure I am."
It's great to have fun, but it's even greater to have great friends. And having lots of friends means that you sometimes have to make choices as to who you'll spend your time with. But that's okay, because good friends will always give you lots of opportunities to have fun. So even if you're missing out, it's never for long.
Respectfully yours,.
Pinkie Pie.
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hi, Pinkie Pie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We were thinking we should go out and celebrate."
Applejack says: "You up for some wheelbarrow races?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Or I could take everypony on a cloud ride!"
Rarity says: "I could throw a party with punch and zesty cucumber sandwiches!"
Rarity says: "Ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You wanna know exactly what I feel like doing right now?"
Fluttershy says: "That looks like fun."
Applejack says: "Oh, Pinkie."
