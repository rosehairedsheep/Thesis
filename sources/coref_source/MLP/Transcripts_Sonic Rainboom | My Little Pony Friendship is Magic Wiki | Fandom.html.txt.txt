Rainbow Dash says: "Now, what have we learned?"
Fluttershy says: "Loss of control."
Rainbow Dash says: "Good."
Fluttershy says: "Screaming and hollering."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yes, and most importantly?"
Fluttershy says: "Passion!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Right!"
Rainbow Dash says: "So now that you know the elements of a good cheer, let's hear one."
Fluttershy says: "Yay."
Rainbow Dash says: "..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh."
Rainbow Dash says: "You're gonna cheer for me like that?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Louder."
Fluttershy says: "Yay."
Rainbow Dash says: "Louder!"
Fluttershy says: "Yay."
Rainbow Dash says: "Louder!"
Fluttershy says: "Yaaay."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh..."
Fluttershy says: "Too loud?"
Fluttershy says: "Yay."
Rainbow Dash says: "And now, phase one of my routine."
Fluttershy says: "Wooo."
Rainbow Dash says: "Phase two."
Fluttershy says: "Way to go."
Rainbow Dash says: "Here we go."
Rainbow Dash says: "Phase three."
Rainbow Dash says: "The sonic rainboom."
Rainbow Dash says: "C'mon!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Last one."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thank you so much for helping me clean up all these books, guys."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It was a crazy week of studying."
Fluttershy says: "Rainbow Dash, you rock!"
Fluttershy says: "Woohoo."
Fluttershy says: "Did my cheering do that?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hehe."
Rainbow Dash says: "Sorry about that ladies."
Rainbow Dash says: "That was a truly feeble performance."
Fluttershy says: "Actually, it wasn't all bad."
Fluttershy says: "I particularly liked it when you made the clouds spin."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm not talking about my performance, I'm talking about yours."
Rainbow Dash says: "That feeble cheering!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are you two arguing about?"
Fluttershy says: "Were we arguing?"
Fluttershy says: "I'm sorry."
Rainbow Dash says: "I wish you guys could come to Cloudsdale to see me compete in the Best Young Flyer Competition."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's that?"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's where all the greatest Pegasus flyers get together and show off their different flying styles!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Some are fast!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And some are graceful."
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Applejack says: "Golly."
Applejack says: "I'd love to see you strut yer stuff in that competition."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah."
Rainbow Dash says: "I wish you guys could be there."
Rainbow Dash says: "Fluttershy's a great support, but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'd love to see you make a sonic rainboom!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's like, the most coolest thing ever!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Even though I've never actually seen it, but I mean come on!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's a sonic rainboom!"
Pinkie Pie says: "How not cool could it possibly not be?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's a sonic rainboom?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You really need to get out more."
Pinkie Pie says: "The sonic rainboom is legendary!"
Pinkie Pie says: "When a Pegasus like Rainbow Dash gets going sooo fast..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Boom!"
Pinkie Pie says: "A sonic boom and a rainbow can happen all at once!"
Applejack says: "And Rainbow Dash here's the only pony to ever pull it off!"
Rainbow Dash says: "It was a long time ago..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I was just a filly."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah, but you're gonna do it again, right?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Are..."
Rainbow Dash says: "you kidding?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm the greatest flyer to ever come out of Cloudsdale!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I could do sonic rainbooms in my sleep."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wow."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If you pull that off, you'll win the crown for sure!"
Rainbow Dash says: "The grand prize is an entire day with the Wonderbolts."
Rainbow Dash says: "A whole day of flying with my lifelong heroes..."
Rainbow Dash says: "It'll be a dream come true!"
Fluttershy says: "Yay."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm gonna go rest up."
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't wanna over prepare myself, y'know."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hehe."
Rainbow Dash says: "You, on the other hand, better keep practicing."
Rainbow Dash says: "I need a cheering section to match my spectacular performance."
Fluttershy says: "She's practiced that move a hundred times, and she's never even come close to doing it."
Fluttershy says: "I don't know if I can cheer loud enough to help her."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, guess we better get this cleaned up..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "again."
Rarity says: "Go on, go on."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Go on what?"
Rarity says: "Find a spell that will get us wingless ponies into Cloudsdale."
Rarity says: "Didn't you see how nervous she was?"
Applejack says: "Nervous?"
Applejack says: "Have you spit yer bit or somethin'?"
Applejack says: "She was tootin' her own horn louder than the brass section of a marching band!"
Rarity says: "Oh, puh-lease."
Rarity says: "I have put on enough fashion shows to recognize stage fright when I see it."
Rarity says: "We've got to find a way to be there for her."
Rarity says: "Now go on!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Owaa!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "How am I supposed to find a flight spell in this mess?"
Pinkie Pie says: "A flight spell?"
Pinkie Pie says: "One sec."
Pinkie Pie says: "Page twenty-seven."
Applejack says: "How'd you do that?"
Pinkie Pie says: "It landed on my face when Rainbow Dash knocked me into the bookcase."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Here it is!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "A spell that will allow Earth ponies to fly for three days."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ooh, it looks really difficult..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm not sure I can do it."
Rarity says: "You've got to try!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But who's gonna volunteer to be the test subject?"
Rarity says: "I will!"
Rarity says: "For Rainbow Dash, I will go first."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Here goes."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I think it worked!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You've got to learn to be assertive, Fluttershy."
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't be afraid to speak up."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Well, well, well."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "What do we have here?"
Hoops says: "It's our old friend Rainbow Crash!"
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Get kicked outta any flight schools lately?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I didn't get kicked out."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Face it, Rainbow Crash."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Flight school had too many rules, and not enough naptimes for you."
Hoops says: "Huh, ask her about the sonic rainboom."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "That's nothing but an old mare's tale."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "You don't have the skills to try something like that."
Fluttershy says: "Now wait just a minute!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, I'm sorry."
Fluttershy says: "I'm trying to be more assertive."
Fluttershy says: "Anyhow..."
Fluttershy says: "She is going to do a sonic rainboom!"
"Dumb-Bell" says: "No she's not, 'cause there's no such thing!"
Fluttershy says: "Then show up at the Cloudeseum and see for yourself!"
Fluttershy says: "..."
Fluttershy says: "If you're free."
Hoops says: "Yeah, I'll be free."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Oh, don't worry."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "We'll be there!"
Hoops says: "See you then, Rainbow Crash!"
Fluttershy says: "Did you see that?"
Fluttershy says: "I was so assertive!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Those guys are right."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'll never be able to do it."
Fluttershy says: "But Rainbow Dash, just because you've failed the sonic rainboom a hundred thousand times in practice doesn't mean you won't be able to do it in front of an entire stadium, full of impatient, super-critical sportsfan ponies."
Rainbow Dash says: "Aaaaaah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What do I do?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Everypony's gonna see me fail!"
Rainbow Dash says: "The Wonderbolts will never let a loser like me join."
Rainbow Dash says: "Princess Celestia will probably banish me to the Everfree Forest!"
Rainbow Dash says: "My life is ruined!"
Fluttershy says: "Rare..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Rare?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "The sonic rainboom is way more than rare!"
Fluttershy says: "Rarity?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Rarity!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Are you..."
Rainbow Dash says: "flying?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rarity says: "I most certainly am!"
Rarity says: "Aren't my wings smashing?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "Twilight made them for me."
Rarity says: "I just adore them!"
Rarity says: "Why so shocked?"
Rarity says: "We couldn't leave our favorite flyer without a big cheering section!"
Rainbow Dash says: ""We"?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I can't believe it!"
Fluttershy says: "It's incredible!"
Rainbow Dash says: "This is so cool!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You guys made it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Sure did!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wait!"
Rainbow Dash says: "How'd you do that?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Only Pegasus ponies can walk on clouds."
Pinkie Pie says: "Haha."
Pinkie Pie says: "Pretty cool, huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I found a spell that makes temporary wings, but it was too difficult to do more than once."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So I found an easier spell that lets the rest of us walk on clouds."
Applejack says: "And we came to cheer you to victory!"
Rainbow Dash says: "To be honest, I was starting to get just the teeniest, tiniest bit nervous."
Rainbow Dash says: "But I feel a lot better now that you guys are here."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, we've got some time before the competition."
Rainbow Dash says: "Why don't Fluttershy and I show you around Cloudsdale?"
Rarity says: "Yes!"
Applejack says: "Yes!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yes!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Here it is: the greatest city in the sky!"
Group says: "Oooh!"
Group says: "Aaah!"
Rarity says: "Oooh!"
Rarity says: "Aaah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uhh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Some of the greatest Pegasi in history came from Cloudsdale!"
Rarity says: "Oh, wait for me!"
Steam Roller says: "Those wings are gorgeous!"
Rarity says: "Why, thank you!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Be careful with those wings, Rarity."
Twilight Sparkle says: "They're made from gossamer and morning dew, and they're incredibly delicate."
Rarity says: "Don't worry, Twilight."
Rarity says: "I'm sure they can't get worn out from too much attention."
Applejack says: "Since we're up here, I'd sure like to get a look at where the weather's made."
Rainbow Dash says: "Great idea!"
Rainbow Dash says: "C'mon, girls."
Rainbow Dash says: "To the weather factory!"
Rainbow Dash says: "This is where they make the snowflakes."
Rainbow Dash says: "Each one is hoofmade."
Rainbow Dash says: "As you can see, it's a delicate operation."
Rarity says: "Ooh, the snowflakes look even better from up here."
Rainbow Dash says: "We better move on before Rarity ruins winter and causes a drought."
Rainbow Dash says: "And here's where they make the rainbows!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Spicyyyyyy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, rainbows aren't really known for their flavor."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Whoa!"
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Oh, where'd you get those amazing wings?"
"Dumb-Bell" says: "I want a pair!"
Rarity says: "Hmm..."
Rarity says: "Yeah, I guess I could see that."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Oh, hey look, it's Rainbow Crash again!"
Hoops says: "Heheheyeah!"
Hoops says: "Rainbow..."
Hoops says: "Umm..."
Hoops says: "Eyah..."
Hoops says: "Crash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Rarity!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What're you doing talking to these guys?"
Rarity says: "Oh, they were just admiring my wings, Rainbow Dash."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Yeah, you should forget the sonic rainboom and just get yourself some wings like these!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oohh..."
Fluttershy says: "Uhh..."
Fluttershy says: "C'mon, girls."
Fluttershy says: "Why don't we go see how clouds are made?"
Fluttershy says: "Don't listen to them."
Fluttershy says: "You're gonna win that competition for sure!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Are you kidding?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I can't do the sonic rainboom, and just look at these boring, plain old feathered wings."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm doomed!"
Rarity says: "What, these old things?"
Rarity says: "Go ahead, everypony."
Rarity says: "Photos are encouraged."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rarity, we're supposed to be helping Rainbow Dash relax, remember?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Put your wings away and stop showing off!"
Rarity says: "Oh, pfft."
Rarity says: "How can you ask me to put away perfection?"
Rarity says: "Waa-haa-haa!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash, are you okay?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You don't look so good."
Rainbow Dash says: "Of course!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Why wouldn't I be okay?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Everyone's so in love with Rarity's wings that they won't even notice when I totally blow it in the Best Young Flyer's Competition."
Rainbowshine says: "Hey!"
Rainbowshine says: "There's an idea!"
Rainbowshine says: "YOU should enter the competition!"
Foggy Fleece says: "Yeah!"
Foggy Fleece says: "I could watch you fly all day long!"
Rarity says: "There really isn't anypony who uses their wings quite like me."
Rarity says: "Perhaps I should compete."
Rainbow Dash says: "WHAT?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What am I gonna DO?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'll never win the competition now..."
Rarity says: "I'm going to be a while!"
Madden says: "Fillies and gentlecolts!"
Madden says: "Please rise and join me in welcoming our beloved Princess Celestia!"
Madden says: "Please welcome our celebrity judges for the Best Young Flyer Competition: the Wonderbolts!"
Madden says: "And now, let's find out who will take the prize as this year's best young flyer!"
Lucy Packard says: "Okay, contestant number one, you're up."
Rainbow Dash says: "Eyah!"
Lucy Packard says: "Okay, number two, let's go."
Rainbow Dash says: "Umm..."
Lucy Packard says: "C'mon, c'mon, we ain't got all day!"
Rainbow Dash says: "She's talking to you!"
Dr. Hooves says: "Oh."
Dr. Hooves says: "Umm..."
Dr. Hooves says: "Oh, I guess that's me!"
Lucy Packard says: "Okay, number four, time to go."
Rarity says: "I'm number four, and I need just one more itsy-bitsy minute."
Rarity says: "Be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hmm?"
Lucy Packard says: "Look, I don't care who it is, but somepony's gotta go on!"
Meadow Song says: "Let's do this!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uhh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "What am I gonna do?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I loved number seven."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Doing fifteen barrel rolls in a row can't be easy."
Fluttershy says: "My favorite is number ten."
Fluttershy says: "She just looked like such a nice pony."
Applejack says: "Hmm..."
Applejack says: "Wonder how come we haven't seen Rainbow Dash or Rarity yet."
Applejack says: "The competition's almost over."
Lucy Packard says: "Number fifteen, let's go!"
Rarity says: "Rarity..."
Rarity says: "is ready!"
Lucy Packard says: "Look, ladies."
Lucy Packard says: "I don't know what to tell you."
Lucy Packard says: "There's only time for one more performance."
Lucy Packard says: "If you both want to compete, you'll just have to go out there together!"
Rarity says: "Well, Rainbow Dash?"
Rarity says: "Shall we?"
Madden says: "And now, for our final competitor of the day, contestant number fifteen!"
Madden says: "Uhh..."
Madden says: "And apparently contestant number four..."
Rarity says: "Good luck, Rainbow Dash."
Rarity says: "Just do your best."
Rarity says: "I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of changing our music."
Rarity says: "That "rock and roll" doesn't really match my wings."
Rainbow Dash says: "C'mon, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash says: "You can do this."
Rainbow Dash says: "Just remember the routine."
Rainbow Dash says: "Phase one."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oof."
Rainbow Dash says: "Waaah!"
Hoops says: "Nice work, Rainbow Crash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Time for phase two."
Fluttershy says: "Look!"
Fluttershy says: "Phase two is working."
Rarity says: "And now for my grand finale."
Rarity says: "I will fly right up to the sun and beam my beautiful wings over the whole city of Cloudsdale!"
Rarity says: "They'll be talking about it for years!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Looks like this is my last chance to turn things around."
Rainbow Dash says: "Phase three."
Rainbow Dash says: "The sonic  rainboom."
Rainbow Dash says: "Wings, don't fail me now!"
Rarity says: "Look upon me, Equestria, for I..."
Rarity says: "am..."
Rarity says: "Rarity!"
Rarity says: "Uh-oh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh no!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Her wings evaporated into thin air!"
Misty Fly says: "Ooh!"
Soarin says: "Aah!"
Spitfire says: "Uuh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hold on, Rarity!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm coming!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, I can't look!"
Fluttershy says: "A sonic rainboom!"
Fluttershy says: "She did it!"
Fluttershy says: "She did it!"
Fluttershy says: "Wooo!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa."
Fluttershy says: "A sonic rainboom!"
Fluttershy says: "Wooo!"
Fluttershy says: "Yeah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I did it."
Rainbow Dash says: "I did it!"
Rarity says: "You sure did."
Rarity says: "Oh thank you, Rainbow Dash."
Rarity says: "You saved my life!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh yeah."
Rainbow Dash says: "I did that too."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ha, best day ever!"
Rarity says: "I want to apologize to all of you for getting so carried away with my..."
Rarity says: "beautiful wings."
Rarity says: "I guess I just lost my head."
Fluttershy says: "It's okay."
Applejack says: "Oh, don't worry about it, kiddo."
Pinkie Pie says: "We still love you."
Rarity says: "And I'm especially sorry that I was so thoughtless as to jump into the contest at the last minute after you had worked so hard to win it."
Rarity says: "Can you ever ever forgive me?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Aw, it's okay."
Rainbow Dash says: "Everything turned out all right, right?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I just wish I could have met the Wonderbolts when they were awake."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!"
Spitfire says: "So you're the little pony who saved our lives."
Spitfire says: "We really wanted to meet you, and say thanks."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Princess."
Princess Celestia says: "Hello, Twilight Sparkle, and hello to your friends too."
Rarity says: "Princess Celestia, I am sorry I ruined the competition."
Rarity says: "Rainbow Dash here really is the best flyer in Equestria."
Princess Celestia says: "I know she is, my dear."
Princess Celestia says: "That's why, for her incredible act of bravery and her spectacular sonic rainboom, I'm presenting the grand prize for Best Young Flyer to this year's winner, Miss Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh!"
Princess Celestia says: "So Twilight Sparkle, did you learn anything about friendship from this experience?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I did Princess, but I think Rarity learned even more than me."
Rarity says: "I certainly did."
Rarity says: "I learned how important it is to keep your hooves on the ground, and be there for your friends."
Princess Celestia says: "Excellent."
Princess Celestia says: "Well done, Rarity."
Rainbow Dash says: "This really is the best day ever!"
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Uhh, hey, Rainbow Crash."
Hoops says: "Dash!"
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Oh!"
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Uhh..."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Sorry."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Rainbow Dash."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Uhh, we just wanted to congratulate you on winning the competition."
Hoops says: "That sonic rainboom was awesome!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh, thanks, guys."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Uhh, we're really sorry we gave you such a hard time before."
Rainbow Dash says: "Aww, that's okay."
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't worry about it."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Hey."
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Do you want to hang out with us?"
"Dumb-Bell" says: "Maybe you could show us how you did that incredible trick!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Sorry, boys..."
Rainbow Dash says: "But I've got plans!"
