Rarity says: "So sorry, Fluttershy."
Rarity says: "I hate being late for our weekly get-together."
Rarity says: "The usual!"
Rarity says: "But you will not believe what happened to me."
Fluttershy says: "Is everything all right?"
Rarity says: "Oh, it's much more than all right."
Rarity says: "I was on my way here, wearing my latest hat creation, when who should stop me on the street but Photo Finish!"
Rarity says: "?"
Fluttershy says: "Photo Finish?"
Rarity says: "She is the most famous fashion photographer in all of Equestria."
Rarity says: "Anywho, she saw my hat and said it was absolutely marvelous!"
Fluttershy says: "What a lovely compliment."
Rarity says: "She was so impressed that she wants to take some pictures of my shop featuring some of my clothes!"
Fluttershy says: "That's wonderful."
Rarity says: "Do you know what this could mean for my fashion career?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, Rarity, I'm so happy for you."
Rarity says: "But I'm going to need somepony fabulous to model for me."
Rarity says: "Somepony with beauty."
Rarity says: "Somepony with grace."
Rarity says: "Somepony..."
Rarity says: "like you?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, goodness."
Fluttershy says: "I don't know."
Rarity says: "Oh, this is such a huge opportunity."
Rarity says: "And it would mean so much to me."
Fluttershy says: "I'm flattered, really."
Rarity says: "Nopony is going to have your elegance and poise."
Fluttershy says: "But..."
Rarity says: "Nopony!"
Rarity says: "Please!"
Fluttershy says: "Somepony more into fashion."
Rarity says: "Please!"
Fluttershy says: "Somepony more comfortable in the spotlight."
Rarity says: "Please, please, pleeease!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, if it's that important to you, of course I'll do it."
Rarity says: "Oh, thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou!"
Rarity says: "You are the best friend a pony could ever have!"
Fluttershy says: "What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon."
Rarity says: "Isn't it?"
Rarity says: "Though I was so afraid you wouldn't agree to model for me that I felt completely frazzled."
Rarity says: "I think I feel a pimple coming on."
Rarity says: "Oh!"
Rarity says: "Only one solution!"
Rarity says: "The usual!"
Rarity says: "Hm..."
Rarity says: "She's going to want to see attitude and pizzazz."
Fluttershy says: "A-a-attitude and, um..."
Fluttershy says: "pizzazz."
Rarity says: "More light!"
Rarity says: "It has to catch the sequins just so or the whole outfit is just a disaster."
Rarity says: "Oh, and the headdress needs more feathers."
Rarity says: "Pinkie Pie!"
Rarity says: "More feathers!"
Rarity says: "And sequins!"
Rarity says: "More sequins!"
Rarity says: "And more ribbon!"
Rarity says: "Oh no!"
Rarity says: "Less ribbon."
Rarity says: "No!"
Rarity says: "More ribbon."
Rarity says: "Oh, this hem is completely off."
Rarity says: "Pincushion!"
Rarity says: "Thank you all for helping me."
Rarity says: "I'm sorry to be so short with you, but I'm..."
Rarity says: "I'm just so nervous."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, doesn't that hurt?"
Spike says: "Thick scales."
Spike says: "Can't feel a thing."
Spike says: "And even if I could, there is no pain that would keep me from assisting the most beautiful creature in the world."
Spike says: "I'm gonna tell you two a secret."
Spike says: "But you have to promise not to tell anyone."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I promise."
Pinkie Pie says: "Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye."
Spike says: "I have a crush on Rarity!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We won't say a word!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Give me a break."
Pinkie Pie says: "Twilight!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You promised Spike you wouldn't say anything."
Pinkie Pie says: "He trusts you."
Pinkie Pie says: "And losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend forever!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Forever!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "My lips are sealed."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Though I'm pretty sure Rarity is gonna pick up on your feelings."
Photo Finish says: "I, Photo Finish..."
Photo Finish says: "have arrived."
Rarity says: "Let me just say, what an honor!"
Photo Finish says: "We begin..."
Photo Finish says: "now!"
Rarity says: "Attitude and pizzazz!"
Photo Finish says: "Yes!"
Photo Finish says: "Show Photo Finish something."
Photo Finish says: "No!"
Photo Finish says: "Yeees."
Photo Finish says: "No!"
Photo Finish says: "Yeees."
Photo Finish says: "No!"
Photo Finish says: "Yeees."
Photo Finish says: "Enough!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "She hardly took any pictures."
Fluttershy says: "I'm so sorry."
Fluttershy says: "I tried my best."
Rarity says: "Well, the headdress is too big for you and cape had too much sparkle."
Rarity says: "I can't believe I ever thought I could impress her."
Photo Finish says: "It seems that I, Photo Finish, have found the next fashion star here in Ponyville."
Rarity says: "Really?"
Photo Finish says: "Yes."
Photo Finish says: "Really."
Photo Finish says: "And I, Photo Finish, am going to help her to shine all over Eqvestria."
Photo Finish says: "Tomorrow, a photo shoot in ze park."
Photo Finish says: "I go!"
Rarity says: "Did you hear that?"
Rarity says: "I am going to "shine all over Equestria"."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, Rarity."
Fluttershy says: "I was so worried I'd ruined everything."
Rarity says: "Oh, never."
Rarity says: "I knew you'd be perfect."
Rarity says: "No, no, no, yes!"
Rarity says: "That is definitely the one."
Rarity says: "Photo Finish is going to love it."
Rarity says: "Everypony is going to love it!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, I am so excited for you."
Fluttershy says: "Just don't forget us little ponies when you become the most famous designer in all of Equestria."
Rarity says: "Never."
Photo Finish says: "Put me down here."
Photo Finish says: "Oh, nonononononono."
Photo Finish says: "The model should be in something simple!"
Photo Finish says: "Something inspired by..."
Photo Finish says: "the nature!"
Rarity says: "That's just what I was thinking."
Rarity says: "Um..."
Rarity says: "give me a moment and I'll, uh, put a little something together."
Photo Finish says: "Yes..."
Photo Finish says: "that will not be necessary."
Rarity says: "But..."
Rarity says: "but..."
Rarity says: "how are you going to help me "shine across Equestria" if I don't design something new for these pictures?"
Photo Finish says: "I am not going to help you shine across Equestria."
Photo Finish says: "I am going to help her shine."
Photo Finish says: "She is my star."
Photo Finish says: "You!"
Photo Finish says: "Go!"
Fluttershy says: "I can't, Rarity."
Rarity says: "Oh, but you must, Fluttershy."
Rarity says: "Photo Finish wants to make you a star."
Rarity says: "This is the opportunity of a lifetime."
Rarity says: "I know we were both hoping it would be my lifetime, but nonetheless you can't throw away this chance."
Rarity says: "You must do this for me."
Rarity says: "You must."
Rarity says: "You must!"
Rarity says: "You must!"
Photo Finish says: "Floottershy!"
Photo Finish says: "It is time to make..."
Photo Finish says: "the magics!"
Photo Finish says: "Oh, wunderbar!"
Photo Finish says: "You are like a delicate flower."
Photo Finish says: "So much more alluring without all those sparkles und feathers."
Pinkie Pie says: "How'd it go?"
Pinkie Pie says: "How'd it go?"
Rarity says: "It didn't."
Rarity says: "Photo Finish wanted to work with Fluttershy, not me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Rarity."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm so sorry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Is there anything we can do?"
Rarity says: "I just vant to be alone right now."
Spike says: "You heard her."
Spike says: "She vants to be..."
Spike says: "alone."
Spike says: "What?"
Spike says: "I didn't think she meant alone alone."
Photo Finish says: "Too much blush."
Photo Finish says: "Not enough."
Photo Finish says: "Too much."
Photo Finish says: "Not enough."
Photo Finish says: "Perfect."
Fluttershy says: "Ah..."
Fluttershy says: "Aaah..."
Photo Finish says: "Oh, yes!"
Photo Finish says: "Even her schneezes are graceful."
Photo Finish says: "Now go!"
Photo Finish says: "How do you feel?"
Photo Finish says: "Excited?"
Photo Finish says: "Overjoyed?"
Photo Finish says: "Thrilled beyond your wildest dreams?"
Fluttershy says: "N..."
Fluttershy says: "nervous."
Photo Finish says: "Nervous?"
Photo Finish says: "Dun be ridiculous."
Photo Finish says: "You're only facing a large crowd of ponies who will be watching your every move and silently judging you."
Photo Finish says: "Your cue!"
Photo Finish says: "Now go!"
Background voice says: "No seriously..."
Fluttershy says: "You can't let Rarity down."
Fluttershy says: "You must do this."
Fluttershy says: "You must."
Fluttershy says: "You must."
Fluttershy says: "You must."
Lyrica Lilac says: "So graceful."
Royal Ribbon says: "So lovely."
Hoity Toity says: "So perfect for my new advertisement."
Shoeshine says: "It's Fluttershy!"
Rarity says: "Wow."
Rarity says: "Look how popular you are."
Rarity says: "I'm so excited for you."
Rarity says: "You must be having the best time ever."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, yes."
Fluttershy says: "Best time ever..."
Photo Finish says: "Floottershy!"
Photo Finish says: "I have been looking for you everywhere."
Photo Finish says: "We have the thing at the place."
Fluttershy says: "I'll see you at the spa?"
Fluttershy says: "Our usual time?"
Rarity says: "Of course!"
Rarity says: "I can't wait to hear all about the..."
Rarity says: ""thing at the place"."
Rarity says: "I'm the one who should be mobbed by strangers wherever I go."
Rarity says: "Welcome to Carousel Boutique!"
Sweetie Drops says: "Is she still here?"
Sweetie Drops says: "We heard Fluttershy was here."
Rarity says: "Sorry."
Rarity says: "You just missed her."
Rarity says: "But you're still in luck."
Rarity says: "I'm having a huge sale on some of my best designs."
Sweetie Drops says: "And you are..."
Sweetie Drops says: "?"
Rarity says: "Rarity, of course."
Sweetie Drops says: "Never heard of you."
Photo Finish says: "Obviously I, Photo Finish, am thwilled to have found her."
Fluttershy says: "Photo Finish?"
Photo Finish says: "She's a natural in front of the camera."
Fluttershy says: "Um..."
Fluttershy says: "Photo Finish?"
Photo Finish says: "I only need to point and shoot, and I capture..."
Photo Finish says: "the magics!"
[ponies says: "Over here!"
[ponies says: "Fluttershy, over here!"
Fluttershy says: "Photo Finish, I'm so sorry to interrupt."
Fluttershy says: "It's just that I'm running late."
Photo Finish says: "How could I have forgotten?!"
Photo Finish says: "!"
Photo Finish says: "Your appearance at the ballet opening!"
Photo Finish says: "Everypony who is anypony will be there."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, actually I'm supposed to be meeting my friend..."
Photo Finish says: "We go!"
Rarity says: "My hooves are getting positively pruney, I've been waiting here so long."
Rarity says: "Obviously Fluttershy's just too busy with her new career to spend time with her best friend."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm sure she just got tied up."
Rarity says: "Of course she did."
Rarity says: "She's a big bright shining star!"
Rarity says: "I wish that star would burn out."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rarity!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy is your friend."
Rarity says: "I know, I know."
Rarity says: "And I should be happy for her, but instead I'm just..."
Rarity says: "jealous!"
Rarity says: "Oh, please promise you won't tell her I feel this way."
Rarity says: "Please, please, pleasepleaseplease!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You have my word."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend."
Pinkie Pie says: "Forever!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wow!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You look great!"
Rarity says: "Fluttershy may be the one who's famous, but that doesn't mean I have to stop looking fabulous."
Fluttershy says: "Rarity!"
Fluttershy says: "I'm so sorry I'm..."
Fluttershy says: "Oh no."
Fluttershy says: "She's already gone, isn't she?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sorry."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, I can't believe this."
Fluttershy says: "I am so frustrated, I could just scream."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Feel better?"
Fluttershy says: "No."
Fluttershy says: "Can I tell you something?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Of course."
Fluttershy says: "You promise not to tell Rarity?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I swear."
Fluttershy says: "Pinkie Pie Swear?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my  Ooowwwww!"
Fluttershy says: "I don't like being a model."
Fluttershy says: "No, I hate being a model."
Fluttershy says: "All this attention is awful, just awful."
Fluttershy says: "And I'm only doing it because Rarity told me I must."
Fluttershy says: "I must!"
Fluttershy says: "I must!"
Fluttershy says: "I must..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, really?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If you wanna know the truth, Rarity..."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, what were you about to say?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Forever!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nothing!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I was just thinking."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If you really don't like being a model, you could always quit."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, no."
Fluttershy says: "I could never do such a thing."
Fluttershy says: "Rarity would be devastated."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But Rarity told me..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Mmm..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Juicy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uhhhhhh!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, if only all these ponies didn't like me so much."
Fluttershy says: "Photo Finish wouldn't want me to model anymore."
Fluttershy says: "She'd find somepony else with..."
Fluttershy says: "the magic!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I guess you're right."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're right."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're right, you're right, you're right!"
Gala Appleby says: "It's Fluttershy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Don't you see?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "On her own, Fluttershy could never do something unattractive."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But if I used my magic to help her do something unattractive at her next fashion show, no one will ever want her to model again."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And if Fluttershy no longer has to be a model, Rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And I'll no longer have to keep their secrets!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's the perfect plan!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You can't tell anyone about it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Promise me you won't tell anyone?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "So you do promise or you don't?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, yes!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Obviously, that's why I zipped my mouth closed, then locked it with a key, then dug a hole, then buried the key, then built a house on top of the hole where I buried the key, then moved into the house on top of the hole."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Obviously."
Fluttershy says: "You really think it'll work?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "They love you for being you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So all I have to do is make you not be you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Just leave it to me."
Rarity says: "Guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about."
Fluttershy says: "Oof!"
Fluttershy says: "Ooh..."
Fluttershy says: "Aah!"
Rarity says: "Oh no."
Golden Harvest says: "Get her off the stage!"
Lemon Hearts says: "She's an embarrassment to all things fashion!"
Photo Finish says: "I, Photo Finish, have made a terrible mistake!"
Rarity says: "Bravo!"
Rarity says: "I say bravo!"
Lyrica Lilac says: "Bravo?"
Lyrica Lilac says: "Who could possibly say bravo to that horrid display?"
Rarity says: "Such attitude!"
Rarity says: "Such pizzazz!"
Rarity says: "She's invented an entirely new kind of modeling!"
Rarity says: "Bravo!"
Lyrica Lilac says: "Who is saying these things?"
Royal Ribbon says: "It's her."
Royal Ribbon says: "The unicorn in the gorgeous cape and headdress."
Lyrica Lilac says: "Now that is a pony who clearly knows a thing or two about fashion."
Lyrica Lilac says: "Well, if that fabulous pony likes it, then I do too!"
Lyrica Lilac says: "Bravo!"
Fluttershy says: "This is awful."
Fluttershy says: "Just awful!"
Fluttershy says: "Somehow I've become more popular than ever."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, I'm so frustrated I could just kick something!"
Fluttershy says: "If only Rarity didn't want me to be a model so badly."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But Rarity..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Rarity says: "Fluttershy!"
Rarity says: "Are you all right?"
Fluttershy says: "I'm great!"
Fluttershy says: "I'm a super famous fashion model."
Fluttershy says: "Why wouldn't I be great?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Because you ha..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Rarity says: "Out there on the runway, everyone was turning on you and..."
Rarity says: "Oh..."
Rarity says: "Oh, Fluttershy."
Rarity says: "It's so awful."
Rarity says: "I wanted them to."
Fluttershy says: "You did?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Of course she did!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Because..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Rarity says: "I'm jealous!"
Rarity says: "I wanted all the attention."
Rarity says: "And instead it was going to you."
Rarity says: "I even started hoping that you would do something silly so your modeling career would be over."
Rarity says: "But then, when it started happening, all I could think was how could I want you to fail at something you love so much?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy doesn't..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh!"
Fluttershy says: "Love?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, Rarity."
Fluttershy says: "I hate being a model."
Rarity says: "You do?"
Fluttershy says: "More than anything."
Rarity says: "Then why did you keep doing it?"
Fluttershy says: "I was afraid if I quit, you'd be mad at me for not wanting to..."
Fluttershy says: ""shine all over Equestria"."
Rarity says: "And I thought if I told you how jealous I was of your success, you'd think I was a terrible friend."
Fluttershy says: "Never!"
Rarity says: "All this time!"
Fluttershy says: "If we'd just told each other the truth."
Rarity says: "I promise never to keep my feelings in secret again."
Fluttershy says: "Me too."
Fluttershy says: "Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye."
Rarity says: "Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye."
Photo Finish says: "You were brilliant."
Photo Finish says: "Brilliant!"
Photo Finish says: "I've already got six photo shoots lined up for tomorrow alone."
Fluttershy says: "I'm sorry, Photo Finish, but I don't think I'll be able to make any of them."
Photo Finish says: "Whaaat?"
Fluttershy says: "We go!"
Rarity says: "We go!"
Photo Finish says: "Vat has just happened?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike has a crush on Rarity!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And you were doing so well."
Fluttershy says: "Now this is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon."
Rarity says: "Isn't it, though?"
Being a good friend means being able to keep a secret. But you should never be afraid to share your true feelings with a good friend. Did you get all that, Spike?
Spike says: "No."
Spike says: "I did not."
Spike says: "I still can't believe you told someone about my secret feelings for Rarity."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're right."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That was wrong of me, and I'm very sorry."
Spike says: "Apology accepted."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now will you take down my letter to Princess Celestia?"
Spike says: "I would love to."
Spike says: "But..."
Spike says: "I'm a little busy at the moment."
