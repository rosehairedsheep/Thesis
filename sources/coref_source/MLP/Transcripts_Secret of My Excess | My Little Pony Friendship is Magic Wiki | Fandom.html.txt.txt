Twilight Sparkle says: "Today is too important."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Re-shelving day!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Understanding Medieval Equestria goes in Pony History."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Modern Spellcasting."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's Classics."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The Art of the To-Do List..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "actually, I kinda wanna read that again."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are you laughing at?"
Spike says: "This little beauty is my birthday present to myself!"
Spike says: "It's a fire ruby!"
Spike says: "I've been aging it for months, and it's almost ripe!"
Spike says: "Hey, you took my advice!"
Spike says: "Just use the whole floor as one big shelf."
Rarity says: "Is that a fire ruby?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "Huh, that must be at least twenty carats!"
Rarity says: "No inclusions, pristine facets..."
Spike says: "And totally delicious."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uhh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "if you guys don't mind?"
Rarity says: "Oh, uh, of course."
Rarity says: "I just came by to see if you had any books on historical fashion..."
Rarity says: "Did you say..."
Rarity says: "delicious?"
Spike says: "Sure did!"
Spike says: "Next week's my birthday, and this is my birthday dinner."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Start with this one."
Rarity says: "Thanks, Twilight."
Rarity says: "I've got a feeling ruffled taffeta capes are going to make a huge comeback this season, and I want to be ahead of the game..."
Rarity says: "I hope it's as tasty as it is beautiful, Spike."
Rarity says: "I've never seen anything quite so stunning before."
Spike says: "Gosh..."
Spike says: "You really like it, huh?"
Rarity says: "Like it?"
Rarity says: "It's magnificent."
Spike says: "Then you should have it."
Spike says: "This beautiful gem was meant to be with you."
Rarity says: "I don't know what to say..."
Rarity says: "this is so thoughtful."
Rarity says: "Oh, my little Spikey-wikey!"
Rarity says: "Thank you so much!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wow, Spike, that's one of the kindest, most generous things you've ever done."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've never seen Rarity so happy!"
Spike says: "I will never wash this cheek again."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Just about finished, Spike?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Everypony will be here soon."
Spike says: "There."
Spike says: "Perfect!"
Spike says: "Everything looks perfect!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not quite everything."
Spike says: "A washcloth?"
Spike says: "I don't get it."
Spike says: "Ah, no way, Twilight!"
Spike says: "I said I wasn't gonna wash the cheek that Rarity kissed, and I meant it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's over, Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm cleaning that cheek!"
Spike says: "It's mine!"
Spike says: "Stop it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Never!"
Spike says: "Twilight..."
Spike says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Happy birthday!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Party time, woo-hoo!"
Spike says: "Are those..."
Spike says: "for me?"
Applejack says: "You bet they are, birthday boy."
Fluttershy says: "Happy birthday, Spike."
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't you know you get presents on your birthday?"
Spike says: "Well, actually, this is my first birthday in Ponyville..."
Spike says: "I usually just get one present..."
Spike says: "from Twilight."
Spike says: "A book."
Rarity says: "Speaking of presents, this is from my new line of taffeta capes."
Rarity says: "I'm going to make one for each of you!"
Rarity says: "I've been inspired by the generosity of my little Spikey-wikey, who gave me this beautiful fire ruby, one of the kindest acts I've ever experienced."
Rarity says: "Mmm."
Spike says: "Applejack, I can't thank you enough for this great blanket."
Spike says: "I really needed a new one."
Applejack says: "C'mon, Spike, you already thanked me fifteen times."
Applejack says: "I'm startin' to get a little embarrassed."
Spike says: "I know I keep thanking you guys, but I'm just so grateful."
Spike says: "I wish this party could last forever."
Pinkie Pie says: "Duh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "The party can't last forever 'cause you have to go to Sugarcube Corner, 'cause the Cakes said they have a special surprise for you, 'cause it's your birthday!"
Spike says: "No way!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I said the party couldn't last forever, but it doesn't need to end right now!"
Spike says: "Hi, Mr."
Spike says: "and Mrs."
Spike says: "Cake!"
Mr. Cake says: "There's the dragon of the hour!"
Mr. Cake says: "Happy birthday, Spike!"
Spike says: "Thanks!"
Mrs. Cake says: "When we found out it was your birthday, we couldn't resist trying out a new recipe: sapphire!"
Spike says: "Wow!"
Spike says: "Thank you so much!"
Spike says: "Man, first I get a bunch of great presents from my best friends, and now an amazing sapphire cupcake!"
Spike says: "Hohoh, what a day!"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "Oh my gosh!"
Spike says: "I'm so sorry, Cheerilee!"
Cheerilee says: "That's okay."
Cheerilee says: "What's got you so excited?"
Spike says: "Pinkie Pie told me I should come see the Cakes, so they could give me a cake 'cause it's my birthday today."
Cheerilee says: "Well, happy birthday, Spike!"
Cheerilee says: "I wish I had something to give you!"
Cheerilee says: "Uh..."
Cheerilee says: "Oh!"
Cheerilee says: "Here you go!"
Spike says: "Wow, really?"
Cheerilee says: "Sure!"
Cheerilee says: "Everypony should get fun gifts on their birthday!"
Cheerilee says: "Have a great birthday, Spike."
Spike says: "I wish every day was my birthday..."
Spike says: "Pinkie Pie mentions my birthday to the Cakes, and I get a cupcake."
Spike says: "I mention it to Cheerilee, and I get this great hat."
Spike says: "Hmmm, I wonder..."
Spike says: "Hey there, Lickety Split!"
Spike says: "That's a pretty cool ball you got there!"
Spike says: "Did you know it's my birthday?"
Spike says: "Hey, Junebug!"
Spike says: "It's my birthday!"
Junebug says: "Happy birthday, Spike."
Spike says: "Aren't you gonna give me something?"
Spike says: "You know, like a birthday present?"
Junebug says: "Um, I..."
Junebug says: "I don't have anything."
Spike says: "Well, how about those flowers?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh, sorry, Junebug, I think Spike might've gotten a little carried away."
Junebug says: "Uh, no problem..."
Junebug says: "H-Happy birthday, Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are you doing?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're out here demanding gifts now?"
Spike says: "Wow, you're right, Twilight."
Spike says: "I don't know what got into me."
Spike says: "Thanks for snapping me out of it."
Spike says: "I'd better go give Cheerilee her hat back."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No problem."
Twilight Sparkle says: "See you at home later?"
Spike says: "Sounds good!"
Spike says: "Bye!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wow, what a rough night's sleep, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can't believe you!"
Spike says: "What happened?"
Spike says: "What's happening to me, Twilight?!"
Spike says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't know!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Think back to last night."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Did something happen?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What did you do after I saw you?"
Spike says: "I went to talk..."
Spike says: "to..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Spike says: "Huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You went to talk to who?"
Spike says: "Oh, um..."
Spike says: "I don't remember."
Spike says: "Hey, can I have that globe?"
Spike says: "You're not using it, right?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Huh?"
Spike says: "What about this book?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, I'm worried about you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're usually not so..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "grabby!"
Spike says: "My arms aren't usually  this long either."
Spike says: "What's happening to me?"
Dr. Horse says: "Well now, what seems to be the problem?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "his!"
Dr. Horse says: "All right then, let's just have a look see, shall we?"
Dr. Horse says: "Widdle guy not feewing too good?"
Dr. Horse says: "Who's a brave widdle boy, huh?"
Dr. Horse says: "Who's a brave one?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "So?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What do you think, Doctor?"
Dr. Horse says: "Well, I think I know what the problem is."
Dr. Horse says: "He's a dragon!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's not the problem."
Twilight Sparkle says: "He's always been a dragon."
Dr. Horse says: "Oh."
Dr. Horse says: "Well, that would explain it."
Dr. Horse says: "Listen, I don't know anything about dragons, I know about baby ponies."
Dr. Horse says: "Maybe you should try a vet."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thank you, doctor."
Dr. Fauna says: "Hm, well, I'm flummoxed."
Dr. Fauna says: "Y'bring me a dog, I've got it diagnosed in seconds."
Dr. Fauna says: "Snake even faster, but..."
Dr. Fauna says: "to be honest, I've never seen a real live dragon before."
Dr. Fauna says: "Who's a good boy?"
Dr. Fauna says: "Who's a good boy?"
Dr. Fauna says: "Sit."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thanks anyway."
Twilight Sparkle says: "C'mon, Spike."
Zecora says: "Ooh, he is starting to mature."
Zecora says: "Of this fact I am quite sure."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Mature?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "So he's just..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "growing up?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But that doesn't explain why he keeps grabbing things."
Zecora says: "A dragon's heart is prone to greed, a steady diet to make growth speed."
Zecora says: "Then, the resulting bigger size only makes their hunger rise."
Zecora says: "If this trait should go unchecked, if Spike continues to collect, more growth will certainly occur â€“ he is going to turn into a monster."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You mean the more things a dragon collects, the bigger and greedier he gets?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But how do we stop him before he's completely out of control?"
Zecora says: "If his monstrous ways you wish to impede, you must prevent him from practicing greed."
Apple Bloom says: "Get away from her, you brute!"
Spike says: "Spike want!"
Scootaloo says: "You're not getting my scooter!"
Spike says: "Spike want!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey, Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Check out this amazing broom!"
Spike says: "Spike want!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "C'mon, big boy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Look at this incredible broom!"
Spike says: "Spike want!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fight all you want, I'm not letting you out!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Spike, I just re-shelved this room!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What now?"
Applejack says: "Now who in Ponyville would steal my apples?"
Applejack says: "For that matter, who would steal my leaves?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack, help!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike's running wild and I need you to lasso him!"
Applejack says: "Oh, that's a good one, Twilight."
Applejack says: "Sweet little Spike, running wild."
Applejack says: "Ha, what a laugh."
Applejack says: "Twilight, get my rope."
Applejack says: "Help!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Help!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't tell me!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You-you tied yourselves up?"
Applejack says: "Get us out of here right now!"
Applejack says: "What was that?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Sounded like Fluttershy to me!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "I'm up here!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What happened?"
Fluttershy says: "I was helping my squirrel friends with a dance step, and all of a sudden, a giant, r-rampaging d-d-d-dragon stormed through!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That was Spike!"
Fluttershy says: "Spike?"
Fluttershy says: "But why would Spike steal my chicken coop?"
Fluttershy says: "He just pulled it out of the ground and filled it with a bunch of apples and stuff!"
Rainbow Dash says: "That sounded like Pinkie Pie!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "C'mon, girls!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Back!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Get back!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie Pie!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Stop giving him cake!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm not giving him cake, I'm assaulting him with cake!"
Pinkie Pie says: "How dare you take the cake!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "He's completely out of control!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Who knows where he'll go next!"
Rarity says: "Put me down, you brute!"
Rarity says: "How rude."
Fluttershy says: "Don't worry Rarity, we'll save you!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Put her down, right now!"
Fluttershy says: "I-If you wouldn't mind, that is..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I mean it, dragon boy!"
Fluttershy says: "We'll be ever so grateful if you'd be so kind as to possibly consider..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Drop her, scaly!"
Rarity says: "Hey!"
Rarity says: "I'mâ€“ not someâ€“ sort of commonâ€“ fly swatter!"
Rarity says: "Girls!"
Rarity says: "My cape!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Look!"
Rainbow Dash says: "The Wonderbolts!"
Rarity says: "Oh, be quiet."
Rarity says: "You've got nothing to be proud of."
Rarity says: "You steal everypony's things, terrorize the town, and use me as a weapon against my own friends!"
Rarity says: "Which, as horrible as it is, I can almost understand because you're a dragon and all."
Rarity says: "But this!"
Rarity says: "This is a crime against fashion!"
Rarity says: "Oh no."
Rarity says: "You are not getting this gemstone!"
Rarity says: "This was given to me by my dear friend Spikey-wikey, the kindest, sweetest, most generous dragon ever."
Rarity says: "And it is too precious to me to give to a greedy old beast like you!"
Spike says: "Here, Rarity, you take it."
Spike says: "It would mean even more to see you happy than to eat it myself."
Rarity says: "I..."
Rarity says: "I don't know what to say."
Rarity says: "This is just so generous."
Rarity says: "Oh, what now?"
Rarity says: "I suppose you'll be eating me or something?"
Rarity says: "Spike?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "You're the rampaging dragon?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Somepony do something!"
Rainbow Dash says: "On it!"
Spike says: "Rarity?"
Spike says: "I need to tell you something!"
Spike says: "Just in case we don't make it!"
Fluttershy says: "We did it!"
Fluttershy says: "I can't believe we did it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "All in a day's work."
Rarity says: "Spike, I just have to tell you how absolutely proud I am of you."
Spike says: "Proud of me?"
Rarity says: "Yes."
Rarity says: "It was you who stopped..."
Rarity says: "w-well, you, from destroying Ponyville."
Rarity says: "You are my hero, Spikey-wikey!"
Today I learned a great lesson about friendship. Well, you might think that it would feel good to get lots and lots of stuff, but it doesn't feel nearly as good as giving something special to somepony you really care about. But I learned that it truly is better to give than to receive, and that kindness and generosity are what lead to true friendship. And that's more valuable than anything in the world. Well... almost anything.
