Rarity says: "Oh, thank you so much for helping me with these flyers, Spike."
Rarity says: "I'm so lucky you just happened to be walking past the boutique."
Spike says: "Uh, yeah, right."
Spike says: "Just happened to be walking past."
Pinkie Pie says: "Whatcha got here?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Lost dog?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Balloons for sale?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Guitar lessons?"
Pinkie Pie says: "'Cause I found one, I need some, and yes, I am interested!"
Rarity says: "No."
Rarity says: "It's a call for submissions."
Rarity says: "Fashion contest I'm organizing."
Rarity says: "A showcase for aspiring young designers."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, wow!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What an awesome idea!"
Rarity says: "Thank you."
Rarity says: "I remember how difficult it was to break into the fashion industry when I was starting out."
Rarity says: "That's why the winner of the contest will get to debut their line in the Carousel Boutique!"
Spike says: "So selfless..."
Spike says: "So generous..."
Rarity says: "I've also managed to get esteemed fashion critic Hoity Toity and iconic fashion photographer Photo Finish to come to Ponyville and judge the show."
Rarity says: "And..."
Rarity says: "Wait until you hear who else will be a judge."
Spike says: "Countess Coloratura?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Sassy Saddles?"
Spike says: "Spike?!"
Spike says: "!"
Rarity says: "No!"
Rarity says: "The third judge for the Carousel Boutique's Couture du Future Fashion Contest is none other than..."
Rarity says: "Applejack!"
Applejack says: "What?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Spike says: "What?!"
Spike says: "!"
Rarity says: "..."
Rarity says: "What?"
Applejack says: "What?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Rarity says: "You already said that, darling."
Applejack says: "I know."
Applejack says: "But I had to say it again because that's how confused I am."
Applejack says: "You want me to judge a fashion show?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm sure Rarity has her reasons, and once we hear them, all of this will make sense."
Rarity says: "I admit, Applejack is an unorthodox choice."
Rarity says: "But that is precisely what makes her an inspired choice!"
Pinkie Pie says: "See?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Now it all..."
Pinkie Pie says: "still doesn't make any sense."
Rarity says: "Hoity Toity has expertise in fabric and stitchwork."
Rarity says: "Photo Finish has an artistic eye for shapes and colors."
Rarity says: "But sometimes, we designers forget about practicality."
Rarity says: "That's where you come in."
Applejack says: "Uh, I think I might be a little too practical."
Applejack says: "My closet's nothin' but twenty versions of this hat."
Rarity says: "Which tells me you're a pony who knows what she likes."
Rarity says: "Besides, a judge must be honest, and you're the most honest pony there is."
Rarity says: "Ask any pony â€“ they'll tell you."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Lemme try!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Excuse me."
Pinkie Pie says: "Have you ever heard of Applejack?"
Cherry Fizzy says: "The most honest pony there is?"
Cherry Fizzy says: "Sure have!"
Rarity says: "See?"
Rarity says: "So what do you say?"
Applejack says: "Well, if I'm bein' honest, I don't think I'm the right pony for the job."
Applejack says: "Fashion just ain't my bag of oats."
Pinkie Pie says: "Aw, booooo!"
Rarity says: "I do understand your hesitation."
Rarity says: "But before you say no, sleep on it?"
Applejack says: "Sure, I..."
Applejack says: "guess I can do that for ya."
Applejack says: "Yeah, I know, Big Mac."
Applejack says: "I-I was just as surprised as you are."
Applejack says: "I mean, heh, can you imagine?"
Applejack says: "Me, judgin' a fashion show?"
Apple Bloom says: "I'd do it!"
Apple Bloom says: "It sounds like fun gettin' to see all those pretty outfits!"
Applejack says: "Well, you're the exception in our family, sugarcube."
Applejack says: "You know about that kind o' stuff."
Applejack says: "I'd be as useful as a burned knot on a zapplin' tree."
Applejack says: "Although..."
Applejack says: "Rarity did say I just had to focus on practicality."
Applejack says: "She already has experts for the..."
Applejack says: "uh, fashion-y stuff."
Applejack says: "Eh, but I still wouldn't know what to say."
Applejack says: "Come on, Apple Bloom!"
Applejack says: "You're doublin' our workload here!"
Apple Bloom says: "Sorry."
Apple Bloom says: "I wanted to wear a signature hat like yours, but it's makin' it harder to see."
Applejack says: "That's because it's not like mine."
Apple Bloom says: "Wow!"
Apple Bloom says: "That is a lot better!"
Apple Bloom says: "Thanks, Applejack!"
Applejack says: "Sure thing."
Applejack says: "You know what?"
Applejack says: "I am gonna help Rarity judge her show!"
Applejack says: "I think my sensible "everypony" take on fashion is exactly what the pony community needs!"
Applejack says: "Rarity, I thought about it some more, and if you still need me, I'd love to be a judge."
Rarity says: "I just knew you'd come around!"
Photo Finish says: "I, Photo Finish, have arrived!"
Hoity Toity says: "As has Hoity Toity."
Rarity says: "It's wonderful to see you!"
Rarity says: "Mwah!"
Rarity says: "Mwah!"
Rarity says: "Mwah!"
Photo Finish says: "Kiss!"
Photo Finish says: "Kiss!"
Photo Finish says: "Kiss!"
Rarity says: "Thank you both so much for doing this."
Rarity says: "Mwah!"
Rarity says: "Mwah!"
Rarity says: "Mwah!"
Hoity Toity says: "We missed you at Miss Pommel's debut in Manehattan last week."
Rarity says: "Miss Pommel is showing?"
Rarity says: "I thought she was still making costumes."
Photo Finish says: "You haven't heard?"
Photo Finish says: "Everypony who's anypony is talking about it."
Rarity says: "Oh, my, they're absolutely stunning!"
Applejack says: "It sure is great to hear Miss Pommel is doin' so well."
Photo Finish says: "Who is this?!"
Photo Finish says: "!"
Photo Finish says: "Who speaks?!"
Photo Finish says: "!"
Rarity says: "Oh, uh, this is Applejack."
Rarity says: "Another one of the judges."
Hoity Toity says: "So, judge, what do you think?"
Applejack says: "Oh."
Applejack says: "Wow."
Applejack says: "Uh, that is just..."
Applejack says: "wow."
Applejack says: "These are clothes?"
Photo Finish says: "Ze photo is upside-down!"
Applejack says: "This is..."
Applejack says: "Am I right?"
Hoity Toity says: "Oh, my!"
Photo Finish says: "I faint!"
Photo Finish says: "Ugh..."
Rarity says: "So funny..."
Rarity says: "Ahem."
Applejack says: "Oh, gosh."
Applejack says: "I didn't mean to make her faint."
Rarity says: "Oh, don't worry about it, darling."
Rarity says: "Uh, it happens all the time."
Rarity says: "Besides, that dress did look a bit like a disco ball."
Rarity says: "Although, Miss Pommel is making the point that, no matter what we wear, it is a costume of some kind or another."
Applejack says: "I have no idea what you're talkin' about."
Rarity says: "And..."
Rarity says: "that's okay."
Rarity says: "Let's go meet the designers and help them get ready for the show!"
Rarity says: "Designers, welcome!"
Rarity says: "Today you will work on your designs, and we judges will offer our guidance and advice as you prepare for tomorrow's big show."
Rarity says: "Lily Lace, tell us about your inspiration."
Lily Lace says: "You guys, this morning, on my way here, I heard a bird singing literally the most beautiful song I'd ever heard!"
Lily Lace says: "And I wanted to capture not so much the bird's song exactly but more like how the wind carried the bird's song!"
Hoity Toity says: "Powerful yet at the same time fragile and delicate."
Applejack says: "Uh..."
Applejack says: "Huh?"
Rarity says: "Next up, meet Starstreak."
Starstreak says: "I'm not interested in what's already been done."
Starstreak says: "Only what will exist..."
Starstreak says: "in the future!"
Hoity Toity says: "Mmmm..."
Hoity Toity says: "Tomorrow's fashion belongs to those who hear it coming."
Inky Rose says: "I am Inky Rose."
Photo Finish says: "You have a very focused vision!"
Photo Finish says: "A strong sense of what you want!"
Photo Finish says: "It's gut!"
Rarity says: "Applejack, you've been rather quiet."
Rarity says: "What do you think?"
Applejack says: "Well..."
Applejack says: "it's a lot of black."
Applejack says: "It's kinda..."
Applejack says: "depressing."
Inky Rose says: "How's this?"
Hoity Toity says: "Makes a world of difference!"
Applejack says: "Maybe to fashion experts like you."
Applejack says: "But to ponies like me, it's still black."
Applejack says: "And I'm not sure how you wear singin' birds or the future."
Applejack says: "I don't think they liked what I had to say."
Rarity says: "Ah, well, that's why you're here."
Rarity says: "Fashion needs a healthy dose of practicality now and then."
Applejack says: "Are you puttin' holes in the clothes?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "On purpose?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Inky Rose says: "It's to create a distressed look."
Applejack says: "More like an old and tattered look!"
Applejack says: "When a pony's old clothes get holes in 'em, they don't wanna go to the store to buy new clothes with holes in 'em!"
Rarity says: "Okay, yes, not a very practical choice."
Rarity says: "Fashionable, but not practical."
Photo Finish says: "Simply shtunning!"
Applejack says: "Sure, it looks pretty, but that's a lot of fabric."
Applejack says: "With the way it drags behind, it'll be covered in dirt in no time."
Applejack says: "Thank goodness I'm here."
Applejack says: "Otherwise, we'd have had holes in clothes and dirty dresses."
Rarity says: "But of course, no look is complete without mane and makeup!"
Applejack says: "So, uh..."
Applejack says: "when are you gonna do her mane?"
Starstreak says: "Ugh!"
Starstreak says: "It's already been done!"
Rarity says: "You know what?"
Rarity says: "Uh, I think we've given the designers enough guidance for today."
Rarity says: "Let's, uh, let them finish their work."
Applejack says: "Uh, can't wait to see what y'all do for the big show tomorrow!"
Lily Lace says: "I literally don't know why..."
Starstreak says: "I am so offended."
Inky Rose says: "That was so insensitive..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, Applejack!"
Pinkie Pie says: "On your way home?"
Pinkie Pie says: "How'd the first day of the contest go?"
Applejack says: "Heh!"
Applejack says: "Great!"
Applejack says: "At first, I didn't think I'd be much help."
Applejack says: "But thank goodness I signed on!"
Applejack says: "Without me, they'd be doin' all kinds of crazy fashion-y things!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, Rarity!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Applejack says the contest is going great!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Good thing she's there, huh?"
Rarity says: "Yes, of course..."
Rarity says: "Some of her thoughts are tough to swallow, but hopefully her candor will help the designers achieve the best designs possible."
Pinkie Pie says: "You seem a little stressed."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wanna try?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Music is very relaxing."
Rarity says: "Sure..."
Rarity says: "Hmm."
Rarity says: "Much better."
Rarity says: "I can meet my goals."
Rarity says: "Today is a fresh start."
Rarity says: "Good morning, everypony!"
Rarity says: "Time for final adjustments before the show!"
Hoity Toity says: "If buttons could convey sadness, you've done it."
Applejack says: "To me, they convey wakin' up an hour early just to button 'em all!"
Applejack says: "And that's if you could reach most of 'em!"
Inky Rose says: "Is this better?"
Applejack says: "Heh."
Applejack says: "There you go!"
Applejack says: "Now when it's cold, you just slide it on ya, and you're set."
Applejack says: "Like a poncho!"
Hoity Toity says: "Um..."
Hoity Toity says: "poncho?"
Lily Lace says: "I attached each feather individually!"
Hoity Toity says: "Ohhhhh."
Hoity Toity says: "You used hoof-cross-double-over stitches!"
Hoity Toity says: "They're perfect!"
Applejack says: "Who cares if it's stitched perfectly?"
Applejack says: "You don't need feathers on your head!"
Photo Finish says: "Gasp!"
Applejack says: "My little sister tried to add some flair to her hat, and guess what it got her â€“ an extra hour of work pickin' apples off the ground!"
Photo Finish says: "A good start, but it needs more."
Photo Finish says: "No."
Photo Finish says: "No."
Photo Finish says: "No."
Photo Finish says: "Yes!"
Hoity Toity says: "I'd go with this one."
Photo Finish says: "No, this one!"
Photo Finish says: "Something is funny?"
Applejack says: "What?"
Applejack says: "Oh, no."
Applejack says: "Uh, it's just, I mean..."
Applejack says: "Those belts look the same."
Hoity Toity says: "Well, that one completely changes the look."
Hoity Toity says: "This one complements it."
Applejack says: "You're kiddin', right?"
Rarity says: "Is everything okay?"
Applejack says: "They're havin' a heated debate about those two belts."
Rarity says: "Ooh!"
Rarity says: "Both good choices."
Applejack says: "No!"
Applejack says: "There is no choice!"
Applejack says: "They're the exact same belt!"
Applejack says: "Ugh!"
Applejack says: "This is so silly!"
Applejack says: "Fashion is ridiculous!"
Rarity says: "You don't mean that!"
Applejack says: "I do!"
Applejack says: "I'm sorry, but that's my honest opinion!"
Hoity Toity says: "Well!"
Hoity Toity says: "I never would've come if I knew we were going to be insulted!"
Photo Finish says: "We go!"
Rarity says: "No!"
Rarity says: "Please!"
Rarity says: "Come back!"
Starstreak says: "If they're out, I'm out, too."
Starstreak says: "I didn't get into fashion to design boring utilitarian clothes!"
Lily Lace says: "I want to create elegance and drama!"
Lily Lace says: "And this is literally the opposite ofâ€”"
Lily Lace says: "!"
Inky Rose says: "Yeah..."
Inky Rose says: "no."
Applejack says: "What?"
Applejack says: "I was just bein' honest!"
Rarity says: "Stop everything!"
Rarity says: "There is no show!"
Rarity says: "Take it all down!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Rarity, what's going on?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is everything okay?"
Rarity says: "No!"
Rarity says: "It is the opposite of okay!"
Rarity says: "The judges have quit!"
Rarity says: "The designers have dropped out!"
Rarity says: "The show is cancelled!"
Rarity says: "All my good intentions squashed!"
Rarity says: "And it's all Applejack's fault!"
Applejack says: "Why are you mad at me?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "I was just sayin' what I thought!"
Applejack says: "And isn't that why you wanted me to be a judge?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "For my honesty?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Rarity says: "Of course!"
Rarity says: "But you said fashion is ridiculous!"
Applejack says: "But it's my opinion!"
Applejack says: "And I'm not gonna lie!"
Rarity says: "Ohâ€”"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "Come with me!"
Strawberry Sunrise says: "Rarity!"
Strawberry Sunrise says: "Oh, what a nice surprise!"
Rarity says: "Hello, Strawberry Sunrise."
Rarity says: "This is Applejack."
Rarity says: "I was wondering if you could tell her how you feel about apples."
Strawberry Sunrise says: "Don't like 'em."
Applejack says: "What?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "Why?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "They're crunchy, they're sweet, they're delicious."
Applejack says: "You're right!"
Applejack says: "Apples are better than strawberries!"
Strawberry Sunrise says: "Only if, by "better", you mean "better at being disgusting"."
Applejack says: "You'd better apologize!"
Strawberry Sunrise says: "Oh, I'm sorry..."
Strawberry Sunrise says: "that you actually bite into those tasteless, mealyworm-filled things."
Strawberry Sunrise says: "Ohhh."
Applejack says: "What?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "?"
Rarity says: "Applejack, why are you so angry?"
Rarity says: "It's just Strawberry's honest opinion."
Rarity says: "What's wrong with that?"
Applejack says: "Well, that's fine if she doesn't like 'em!"
Applejack says: "But if she knew how hard we worked to make our apples perfect, maybe she wouldn't be so mean aboutâ€”"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "..."
Applejack says: "Ohhhhhhh..."
Applejack says: "Oh, boy."
Rarity says: "Mm-hmm."
Rarity says: "Doesn't feel so good, does it?"
Applejack says: "Nope."
Applejack says: "No, it does not at all."
Applejack says: "I'm a real rotten apple."
Rarity says: "I appreciate that, Applejack."
Rarity says: "That means a lot."
Rarity says: "I just wish you'd realized it before you ruined the fashion show."
Hoity Toity says: "I need to get some of these."
Photo Finish says: "It's the only way to travel."
Photo Finish says: "What are you doing?!"
Photo Finish says: "!"
Hoity Toity says: "Canterlot is that way."
Applejack says: "Yup."
Applejack says: "But you're not goin' back to Canterlot yet."
Applejack says: "Hey!"
Lily Lace says: "What is sheâ€”"
Lily Lace says: "?!"
Lily Lace says: "!"
Starstreak says: "I don't know."
Inky Rose says: "Run."
Lily Lace says: "I can't even!"
Applejack says: "Whew..."
Applejack says: "Listen, y'all."
Applejack says: "I thought I was just bein' honest when I said all those things."
Applejack says: "But somepony helped me realize I was actually bein' hurtful."
Applejack says: "So for that, I apologize."
Photo Finish says: "Zo!"
Photo Finish says: "You don't think fashion is ridiculous?!"
Photo Finish says: "!"
Applejack says: "Uh..."
Applejack says: "Well, I, uh..."
Applejack says: "I still don't understand it."
Applejack says: "But I appreciate how much it means to y'all and how much hard work you put into it."
Applejack says: "I also know this contest is important to Rarity."
Applejack says: "So what do you say?"
Hoity Toity says: "Well, I'd hate to have come all this way here and not see what you can do."
Starstreak says: "If they're judging, we're in."
Lily Lace says: "Under one condition."
Lily Lace says: "Literally."
Applejack says: "Anything."
Inky Rose says: "Untie us."
Applejack says: "Show's back on, fellers!"
Applejack says: "Ahhh..."
Applejack says: "Aah!"
Inky Rose says: "Uh-uh."
Inky Rose says: "Uh-huh."
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "And then, Applejack found me and told me to distract you for an hour."
Pinkie Pie says: "But the hour's up!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ta-da!"
Rarity says: "B-B-But how?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "They were all leaving."
Rarity says: "This was all coming down."
Lily Lace says: "You can thank Applejack."
Lily Lace says: "She literally did it all by herself."
Applejack says: "I don't think that word means what you think it means."
Applejack says: "But I did bust my tail because I know how much this means to you."
Rarity says: "Ohhhhh!"
Rarity says: "Thank you, Applejack."
Photo Finish says: "We start now!"
Rarity says: "First up, Lily Lace!"
Rarity says: "Starstreak!"
Rarity says: "Inky Rose!"
Rarity says: "And now, it's time to vote."
Rarity says: "I am drawn to the beauty and drama of fashion, and nopony does drama better than Lily Lace, so I vote for her."
Lily Lace says: "It means sooooo much to me!"
Lily Lace says: "I literally can't even!"
Hoity Toity says: "Simplicity is the keynote of true elegance."
Hoity Toity says: "That is why I vote for Inky Rose."
Inky Rose says: "You've..."
Inky Rose says: "made me so..."
Inky Rose says: "happy?"
Photo Finish says: "Fashion is the art!"
Photo Finish says: "I, Photo Finish, vote for Starstreak!"
Starstreak says: "Wonderful to hear, darling."
Rarity says: "Well, it all comes down to you, Applejack."
Pinkie Pie says: "Can you believe it?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "After everything that's happened, Applejack is the deciding vote!"
Pinkie Pie says: "This is so exciting!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Eeeeee!"
Rarity says: "Well, Applejack?"
Applejack says: "Uh..."
Applejack says: "Heh."
Applejack says: "U-Uh..."
Applejack says: "Uh..."
Rarity says: "Lily Lace's clothes go here, Inky Rose's will go there, and Starstreak's there."
Applejack says: "Sorry, but I couldn't pick just one."
Applejack says: "They all did great, and in my opinion, they all deserve to win."
Rarity says: "And I agree."
Rarity says: "I told you your perspective would be beneficial."
Applejack says: "Is, uh, this one of your new designs, Rarity?"
Applejack says: "It's, uh..."
Applejack says: "Uh, the form is..."
Applejack says: "reminiscent of, uh..."
Applejack says: "I mean, it conjures up images of..."
Applejack says: "uh..."
Applejack says: "well, uh..."
Applejack says: "I-I mean..."
Rarity says: "Oh, that?"
Rarity says: "No!"
Rarity says: "I totally messed that one up!"
Rarity says: "It's ghastly!"
Rarity says: "Horrid!"
Rarity says: "Absolutely terrible!"
Applejack says: "Hah."
Applejack says: "Oh, thank goodness."
Applejack says: "'Cause in my honest opinion..."
Applejack says: "it's awful."
Rarity says: "Pffft!"
Rarity says: "When you're right, you're right!"
Applejack says: "I am relieved!"
