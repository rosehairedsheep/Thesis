Applejack says: "And that's when the yellow birdie thought to himself, "Hmm."
Applejack says: "My favorite little tree isn't such a little tree anymore."
Applejack says: "" So she sang her song, big and strong, and they all lived in that great, big tree happily ever after."
Applejack says: "The..."
Applejack says: "end."
Rarity says: "Applejack!"
Rarity says: "Were you reading a bedtime story to..."
Rarity says: "an apple tree?"
Applejack says: "Heh..."
Applejack says: "uh..."
Applejack says: "Well, ya know, bein' replanted in a whole new place is very upsettin' for a tree..."
Applejack says: "and Bloomberg here is one of my favorites."
Rarity says: "No fair, Applejack!"
Rarity says: "You've got a luxurious, private sleeper car for a tree, while I am crowded and cramped in the same car with all the other ponies."
Rarity says: "How am I supposed to get my beauty sleep?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Applejack says: "But Bloomberg's the whole reason we're makin' this trip."
Applejack says: "He needs his rest so we can give him as a gift to my relatives in Appleloosa."
Rarity says: "Hmph!"
Rarity says: "You talk about it as if it's your baby or something."
Applejack says: "Who you callin' a baby?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "Bloomberg's no baby!"
Applejack says: "Don't wet widdle Rarity make you all saddy-waddy."
Applejack says: "Bloomberg's a big and strong apple tree."
Applejack says: "Yes, he is."
Applejack says: "A-coochie-coochie-coo-coo-coo!"
Rarity says: "It's widdle Rarity who's all "saddy-waddy"!"
Rarity says: "Urgh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh man, we're going fast!"
Rainbow Dash says: "This is so exciting, I can't even wait!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh my goodness..."
Rarity says: "For crying out loud in the morning!"
Spike says: "Do you guys mind?"
Spike says: "I was up early fire-roasting those snacks you're all eating, and I'm pooped!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, speaking of, some of these popcorn kernels didn't get popped."
Spike says: "Okay, fine..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ghk..."
Spike says: "Good night!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uhh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "maybe it's time we all got a little shut-eye."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow."
Rainbow Dash says: "Awwww!"
Fluttershy says: "Awwww!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Awwww!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Psst!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie Pie, you asleep yet?"
Pinkie Pie says: "No, are you asleep yet?"
Rainbow Dash says: "If I was sleeping, how could I have asked you if you were asleep?"
Rainbow Dash says: "When we get to Appleloosa, you think we'll have to carry that heavy tree all the way from the train to the orchard?"
Pinkie Pie says: "What tree?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You mean Bloomberg?"
Rainbow Dash says: "..."
Rainbow Dash says: "No, Fluttershy."
Pinkie Pie says: "Fluttershy's not a tree, silly!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's going on?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Rainbow Dash thinks Fluttershy's a tree!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I do not think she's a tree!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Did you say she was a tree?"
Rainbow Dash says: "No."
Rainbow Dash says: "Well.."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yes."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ya know she's not a tree, right?"
Pinkie Pie says: "She's not a tree, Dashie!"
Fluttershy says: "I'd like to be a tree..."
Spike says: "Oh, for Pete's sake!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well that was kind of huffy."
Fluttershy says: "Huffy the magic dragon!"
Rarity says: "Would you all be quiet..."
Rarity says: "now?!"
Rarity says: "!"
All except Rarity says: "Aaaaaah!"
Spike says: "Bloomberg..."
Spike says: "?"
Spike says: "Bloomberg?"
Spike says: "Sorry, but I tend to snore a bit."
Spike says: "Good night."
[indistinct surprise; Rainbow Dash says: "Who gets what now, huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "A buffalo stampede!"
Rarity says: "I just love their accessories!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "They're getting awfully close to the train."
Rarity says: "I want to speak to the manager!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oooh, looky!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Now they're doing tricks!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Now do a backflip!"
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Or..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Just jump?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hmm.."
Rainbow Dash says: "Something tells me this isn't a circus act."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey there!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Where ya headed in such a hurry?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wow, you're pretty quick for someone so..."
Rainbow Dash says: "bulky."
Rainbow Dash says: "No offense."
Little Strongheart says: "Huh.."
Little Strongheart says: "?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I just wanna know– Hey!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm talking to you– Whoa..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Arrgggg..."
Applejack says: "They've got Bloomberg!"
Spike says: "Heeeelp!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And Spike!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugggh.."
Spike says: "Heeeelp!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Dragon-napping Spike."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'll show her!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ow..."
Braeburn says: "Hey there!"
Braeburn says: "Welcome ta A-A-ppleloosa!"
Braeburn says: "Cousin Applejack, mind yer manners, you have yet ta introduce me to your compadres!"
Braeburn says: "Shame on you!"
Braeburn says: "Terrible is right, your train is a full seven minutes late!"
Braeburn says: "That's seven minutes less for you to delight in the pleasures and wonders of..."
Braeburn says: "A-A-A-ppleloosa!"
Braeburn says: "Boggles the mind, we settler ponies built all this in just the past year, don't it?!"
Braeburn says: "!"
Braeburn says: "And as you can see, we have all of the finest comforts."
Braeburn says: "Like horse-drawn carriages!"
"Black Stone" says: "Okay, you pull now."
Noteworthy says: "Aww, we just switched."
Braeburn says: "And those there are horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages."
Applejack says: "..."
Applejack says: "Listen, Braeburn, I– Oof!"
Braeburn says: "And here's our local waterin' hole, the Salt Block."
"Morton Saltworthy" says: "That's enough salt for you!"
Ol' Salt says: "Can't I at least..."
Ol' Salt says: "get a glass of water?"
Braeburn says: "Over there's the office of Sheriff Silverstar."
Braeburn says: "And here's where we have our wild west dances!"
Braeburn says: "And here's where we have our mild west dances!"
Braeburn says: "And here's the most wonderful sight in all of..."
Braeburn says: "A-A-A-ppleloosa!"
Braeburn says: "Our apple orchard."
Applejack says: "Braeburn!"
Braeburn says: "First harvest should be any day now."
Braeburn says: "Good thing too!"
Braeburn says: "'Cause we need that grub to live on."
Applejack says: "Braeburn!"
Braeburn says: "Uh, yes, cuz?"
Applejack says: "You have a very nice town an' all, but we have a hu-uge problem!"
Applejack says: "Some of our friends are missin'!"
Fluttershy says: "A stampede of buffalo."
Rarity says: "They took Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash went after them!"
Fluttershy says: "And we can't find Pinkie Pie."
Applejack says: "And we had an apple tree with us for your orchard, but they took that too!"
Braeburn says: "Did you say..."
Braeburn says: "buffalo?"
Braeburn says: "Them buffalo, they want us settler ponies to take every single tree you see here off this land."
Braeburn says: "They sure as hay don't want any new ones added in."
Fluttershy says: "But why?"
Braeburn says: "Beats me."
Braeburn says: "We put a lot of hard work into this land, so we can feed our town, our families, our foals!"
Braeburn says: "And now they're sayin' all these trees have to go?"
Braeburn says: "T'ain't fair..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ooh, I can't wait to get my hooves on that little buffalo..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hnnh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ow!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Nobody tricks Rainbow Dash and gets away with it."
Pinkie Pie says: "Boo!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie Pie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ah, ya caught me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Looks like I tricked you and didn't get away with it either!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You're good."
Rainbow Dash says: "Shhshh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What do you think you're doing?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You gotta get out of here!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I do?"
Rainbow Dash says: "You're gonna blow my cover."
Pinkie Pie says: "I am?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm trying to save Spike!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh my gosh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "So am I!"
Rainbow Dash says: "And the more of us there are out here, the more chances of us getting..."
Rainbow Dash says: "caught."
Rainbow Dash says: "Run, Pinkie, I'll hold 'em off."
Rainbow Dash says: "Save yourself!"
Spike says: "Stop!"
Spike says: "Dash, Pinkie, 'sup?"
Spike says: "Hey, no worries, I know those guys."
Spike says: "They're cool."
Buffalo says: "If you say so, Spike."
Buffalo says: "Catch ya later, bro."
Spike says: "Seems they took me by mistake."
Spike says: "And they feel awful about it too, poor guys."
Spike says: "Fortunately, they totally respect dragons, so they treat me like an honored guest."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh..."
Spike says: "Still don't like ponies much, though..."
Spike says: "But you're with me, so it's cool."
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, I still don't trust them."
Pinkie Pie says: "Mmm!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Before we finish eating?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Are you loco in the coco?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Can I please have more of that mushy stuff, whatever it was?"
Little Strongheart says: "Certainly."
Little Strongheart says: "And, Mr."
Little Strongheart says: "Spike, you like gemstones, yes?"
Spike says: "Turquoise."
Spike says: "Mmm!"
Spike says: "Heh hah!"
Spike says: "This here is Little Strongheart, and these are my friends Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash says: "You!"
Little Strongheart says: "You!"
Rainbow Dash says: "That's it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We are outta here!"
Little Strongheart says: "Wait!"
Little Strongheart says: "Please accept my apologies for what happened on the train."
Little Strongheart says: "We didn't mean for anyone to be hurt."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, right."
Little Strongheart says: "We only wanted the tree."
Little Strongheart says: "The settler ponies have overtaken the land and have planted an orchard all over it!"
Little Strongheart says: "Because of their thoughtlessness, we can no longer run over our traditional stampeding grounds."
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Huh?"
Spike says: "I think it's time they met Chief Thunderhooves."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "Hmmh."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "We have a long and winding stampeding trail that we have run upon for many generations."
Little Strongheart says: "I think they get the idea, Chief."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "Hmph."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "It is a sacred tradition to run the path every year."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "But this year, these..."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "settler ponies, these..."
Little Strongheart says: "They planted apple trees all over it without asking our permission."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well that's not very nice."
Pinkie Pie says: "Right, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hmph..."
Little Strongheart says: "The ponies refused to move their trees, so we are stuck here, and it is not fair!"
Spike says: "See, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'll say they had a good reason!"
Rainbow Dash says: "C'mon."
Rainbow Dash says: "We have some apple-pickin' Appleloosans to talk to!"
Rarity says: "Ow!"
Rarity says: "Gently, please!"
Applejack says: "Sorry, Rarity, but our friends are out there and we have ta' be ready for a long hike into buffalo territory if we're gonna save 'em!"
Applejack says: "Let's go!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hi, guys!"
Fluttershy says: "Pinkie!"
Fluttershy says: "We're so glad you're safe."
Twilight Sparkle says: "How did you escape from the buffalo?"
Pinkie Pie says: "We didn't!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We promised the buffalo a chance to talk."
Applejack says: "Oh, yeah?"
Applejack says: "'Bout what?"
Rainbow Dash says: "We brought our new pal Little Strongheart here to explain to the Appleloosans why they should move the apple trees off buffalo land."
Applejack says: "That's weird."
Applejack says: "'Cause my cousin Braeburn here wants to explain to the buffalo why they should let the apple trees stay."
Rainbow Dash says: "The land is theirs!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You planted the trees not knowing that."
Rainbow Dash says: "Honest mistake."
Rainbow Dash says: "Now, you just gotta move 'em, that's all."
Braeburn says: "Well..."
Braeburn says: "heh..."
Applejack says: "They busted their rumps here!"
Applejack says: "An' now they're supposed ta bust their rumps again, just 'cause some buffalo won't stampede someplace else?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Plant the trees somewhere else!"
Applejack says: "Where?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "It's the only flatland around these parts!"
Rainbow Dash says: "The buffalo had it first!"
Applejack says: "The settler ponies need it to live!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on, Applejack!"
Applejack says: "You're bein' unreasonable!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I put my hoof down!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Look!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Both the settlers and the buffalo have good reasons to use this land."
Twilight Sparkle says: "There must be something we can do."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I've got an idea!"
Pinkie Pie.
We may be divided.
But of you all, I beg.
To remember we're all hoofed.
At the end of each leg.
No matter what the issue.
Come from wherever you please.
All this fighting gets you nothing.
But hoof-and-mouth disease.
Arguing's not the way.
Hey, come out and play!
It's a shiny, new day.
So, what do you say?
You gotta share.
You gotta care.
It's the right thing to do.
You gotta share.
You gotta care.
And there'll always be a way through.
Both our diets, I should mention.
Are completely vegetarian.
We all eat hay and oats.
Why be at each other's throat?
You gotta share.
You gotta care.
It's the right thing to do.
And there'll always be a way.
Throoooough!
Spike says: "All right, Pinkie Pie!"
Spike says: "That was fantastic!"
Spike says: "What a great song!"
Spike says: "Yeah, right on!"
Chief Thunderhooves says: "It appears that Sheriff Silverstar and I have come to..."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "an agreement."
Sheriff Silverstar says: "We have."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "That was the worst performance we've ever seen."
Sheriff Silverstar says: "Teh..."
Sheriff Silverstar says: "Abso-tively!"
Chief Thunderhooves says: "The time for action..."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "Hmh..."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "is upon us!"
Chief Thunderhooves says: "Our stampede will start at high noon tomorrow."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "And if the orchard is still there, we'll flatten it..."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "and the whole town!"
Little Strongheart says: "But, Chief!"
Sheriff Silverstar says: "An' we Appleloosans say you'd better bring yer best, 'cause we'll be ready and waitin'."
Braeburn says: "But, Sheriff..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh..."
Pinkie Pie says: "That wasn't the message of my song at all..."
Applejack says: "I want my kin ta' have what they need to live..."
Applejack says: "but a storm's a-brewin' here."
Applejack says: "And I don't like the look of it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We've just got to talk some sense into them before somepony gets hurt."
Rarity says: "About the trees."
Goldengrape says: "Grrrrr!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why won't anybody be rational and reasonable?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Spike says: "Isn't there someway to stop this?"
Little Strongheart says: "Unless the settlers remove those trees, I do not think so."
Rainbow Dash says: "I know you don't want to do this."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "But they have taken our land."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "What would you have me do, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I don't know..."
Rainbow Dash says: "but it's never too late to think of something."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "At noon, it will be too late."
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on, think!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Think, think, think, think, think, think, think!"
Rainbow Dash says: "He's not gonna do it!"
Pinkie Pie.
You gotta share.
You gotta care.
It's the right thing to do.
Chief Thunderhooves says: "Grrr..."
You gotta share.
Chief Thunderhooves says: "Chaaarge!"
You gotta care.
Pinkie Pie says: "Wah-ahh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoa-oo-oo-oo-ooa!"
Sheriff Silverstar says: "Ready..."
Sheriff Silverstar says: "aim..."
Sheriff Silverstar says: "fire!"
Sheriff Silverstar says: "Ah!"
Sheriff Silverstar says: "Aah!"
Chief Thunderhooves says: "Nooo!"
Chief Thunderhooves says: "Yum!"
Chief Thunderhooves says: "Hey, I've got a much better idea!"
Chief Thunderhooves says: "We..."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "will allow the apple orchard to stay in exchange for a share of its fruit, heh..."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "Those..."
Chief Thunderhooves says: "delicious apple pies!"
Spike says: "I'd rather eat turquoise any day of the week."
Spike says: "Auhh..."
Spike says: "!"
Applejack says: "Bloomberg, this is yer special day."
Applejack says: "Mama's so proud of you!"
Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing. Even the worst of enemies can become friends. You need understanding and compromise. You've got to share. You've got to care.
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's what I said!"
