Twilight Sparkle says: "Princess Celestia, we came as fast as we could."
Princess Celestia says: "I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony once again and stop Discord."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The Elements!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "They're gone!"
Discord says: "Everypony has to play, or the game is over and I win."
Applejack says: "Our friendship..."
Applejack says: "over?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Who are you talking to?"
Applejack says: "Nopony!"
Applejack says: "Nopony whatsoever."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie Pie!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Are we glad to see you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Why?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Need a good laugh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What is happening to my friends?"
Discord says: "Looks like we might be due for a big old storm of chaos."
Pinkie Pie says: "And what are you laughing at!"
Pinkie Pie says: "?"
Discord says: "Oh, you ponies are just the most fun I've had in aeons."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, quit it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You'd better think before you laugh at the Pink..."
Pinkie Pie says: "ie Pie!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, yeah?"
Fluttershy says: "Well ha, ha."
Pinkie Pie says: "Quit it!"
Fluttershy says: "No."
Fluttershy says: "Ha, ha."
Pinkie Pie says: "Quit it!"
Fluttershy says: "No."
Fluttershy says: "Ha ha-ha ha ha."
Applejack says: "Uh..."
Applejack says: "Rarity?"
Applejack says: "This here diamond of yours?"
Applejack says: "Twilight said we should split it six ways since we, uh, found it together."
Rarity says: "HI-YAH!"
Rarity says: "Try it, punk."
Rarity says: "He's mine."
Rarity says: "All mine!"
Rarity says: "Ya!"
Rarity says: "Ya!"
Rarity says: "Ya!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Girls, why are you all acting like this?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Quit it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Stop it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We need to stick together."
Fluttershy says: "Ha, ha."
Discord says: "It's just too entertaining."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Stop it, Discord."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're not playing fair."
Discord says: "I'm not playing fair?"
Discord says: "Perhaps we haven't met."
Discord says: "I'm Discord, spirit of chaos and disharmony."
Discord says: "Hello?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "How are we supposed to find the Elements of Harmony when you took away the labyrinth before we could get to the end?"
Discord says: "Oh, wait, did you..."
Discord says: "?"
Discord says: "How funny!"
Discord says: "You thought the Elements were in the labyrinth?"
Flashback Discord says: "Twists and turns are my master plan."
Flashback Discord says: "Then find the Elements back where you began."
Discord says: "I never said they were in the labyrinth."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "but..."
Discord says: "Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle."
Discord says: "Maybe the magic of friendship can help you."
Discord says: "Now if you'll excuse me, I have some chaos to wreak."
Pinkie Pie says: "Chocolate milk?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I hate chocolate milk!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Think, Twilight, think!"
Twilight Sparkle says: ""Find the Elements back where you began."
Twilight Sparkle says: "" Back where you began."
Rarity says: "Don't touch my gem!"
Fluttershy says: "I'm touching your gem, Rarity."
Fluttershy says: "Ha, ha."
Pinkie Pie says: "What 'chu laughin' at?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I just want to go home..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wait a minute..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Home!"
Twilight Sparkle says: ""Back where you began!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "" The Elements must be in..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ponyville!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Come on, girls."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm certain this is what Discord's riddle really meant."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If we get back to the library, I have a book that I just know can give us a clue."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ah!"
Fluttershy says: "Good boy, Angel."
Fluttershy says: "Mama's so proud."
Applejack says: "Wow, I can see so much better now."
Applejack says: "Whoa!"
Applejack says: "I meant to do that."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wah!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ahh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Whoa!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Discord's turned our dirt roads into soap!"
Discord says: "Beautiful, isn't it?"
Discord says: "This is the new and improved Ponyville, and these are only my first of changes."
Pinkie Pie says: "This may look like fun, but it's not."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh."
Discord says: "Picture it."
Discord says: "The chaos capital of the world."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can't picture anything."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's too dark."
Discord says: "Well, wait a few minutes and you'll see it in the beautiful light of day."
Discord says: "Or not."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ponyville, the chaos capital of the world?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not if I have anything to say about it."
Fluttershy says: "Don't worry, you won't."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, we're here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Everyone please, please, please just go inside, please?"
Applejack says: "I absolutely refuse."
Fluttershy says: "With pleasure."
Pinkie Pie says: "I hate libraries!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pleeeease, we gotta hurry!"
Rarity says: "Forget it, Twilight."
Rarity says: "I know what you're up to."
Rarity says: "The second I go in, you'll have your little minion Spike come and take Tom!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Tom?"
Rarity says: "Well, it's not going to work."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're not going in without him, are you?"
Rarity says: "Mm-mm."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fine!"
Spike says: "Ah!"
Spike says: "Brrr!"
Spike says: "What did you do that for, Fluttershy?"
Fluttershy says: "'Cause you just looked so peaceful."
Spike says: "I..."
Spike says: "uh..."
Spike says: "huh?"
Rarity says: "Careful, Twilight!"
Rarity says: "You'll ruin his beautiful finish."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, for the love of..."
Spike says: "Twilight, what's going on?"
Spike says: "Why does everybody look so..."
Spike says: "gray?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Don't ask."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I need you to help me find something."
Fluttershy says: "Hey, Twilight, what's soaking wet and clueless?"
Fluttershy says: "Your face!"
Spike says: "What's happened to everypony?"
Applejack says: "I guess you just bring out the worst in us, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No time to explain."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We've got to find the reference guide to the Elements of Harmony before somepony does something she'll regret!"
Spike says: "The Elements of Harmony?"
Spike says: "Oh, I know exactly where that book is."
Spike says: "Found it!"
Fluttershy says: "Hah!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy, you'd better give me that book!"
Fluttershy says: "Keep away!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack, give me that book!"
Applejack says: "I don't have any book."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You guys!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Stop it right now!"
Spike says: "Ugh!"
Rarity says: "Mine!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey, do you even know what you just stole?"
Rarity says: "No, but if you want it, I want it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "GIVE ME THAT BOOK!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where is she?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where's Rarity?"
Applejack says: "Beats me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Lies!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Get back!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "All of you!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is my book, and I'm going to READ IT!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The Elements!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The Elements!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "They were here all along!"
Spike says: "This is great!"
Spike says: "Now you guys can defeat Discord and put everything back to normal!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "See, girls?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We did it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We found the Elements of Harmony!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Together!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You don't even care, do you?"
All says: "No!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I never thought it would happen."
Twilight Sparkle says: "My friends..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "have turned into complete JERKS!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Necklace!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Necklace!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Necklace!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Necklace!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "big crown thingy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Come on, everypony, let's go!"
Spike says: "But Twilight, aren't you missing somepony?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nope."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We've got the liar, the grump, the hoarder, and the brute."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That just about covers it."
Spike says: "But what about Rainbow Dash?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Congratulations, Spike, you're the new Rainbow Dash."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now let's go!"
Spike says: "That won't end well."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Too bad, you're Rainbow Dash."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now let's go defeat Discord so we don't ever have to talk to each other again!"
All but Rarity says: "Yeah!"
All but Rarity says: "Woo-hoo!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Move!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Look out, here comes Tom!"
Discord says: "Well, well, well, I see you've found the Elements of Harmony."
Discord says: "How terrifying!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Discord!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've figured out your lame riddle."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're in for it now!"
Discord says: "I certainly am."
Discord says: "You've clearly out-dueled me, and now it's time to meet my fate."
Discord says: "I'm prepared to be defeated now, ladies."
Discord says: "Fire when ready."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Formation, now!"
All says: "Eh."
Twilight Sparkle says: ""Rainbow Dash", get over here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "All right, let's get this over with."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's going on?"
Applejack says: "Mine's workin'."
Applejack says: "There must be somethin' wrong with yours."
Pinkie Pie says: "I HATE the Elements of Harmony!"
Fluttershy says: "Hmph!"
Fluttershy says: "Garbage."
Rarity says: "MINE!"
Spike says: "Sorry, Twilight."
Spike says: "I guess I'd better get back upstairs and clean up the library."
Spike says: "Good luck with all this– whoa!"
Discord says: "Bravo, ponies, bravo!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's your fault it didn't work."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Who are you talking to?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Any of you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "ALL OF YOU!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm outta here!"
Applejack says: "I better go, too."
Applejack says: "I've got new better friends waiting for me at the farm."
Fluttershy says: "Yeah!"
Fluttershy says: "I'm sick of you losers."
Twilight Sparkle says: "FINE!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Leave!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "See if I care!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't need you guys either!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "With friends like you, who needs..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "enemies..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "?"
Discord says: "Oh, my stomach!"
Discord says: "Twilight, you've got to see what I just did."
Discord says: "It's priceless!"
Discord says: "Come now, Twilight Sparkle."
Discord says: "You've got to get into the spirit of things!"
Discord says: "After all, this is your new home."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not anymore..."
Discord says: "YES!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pack your things, Spike, we're leaving."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Don't ask where we're going, 'cause I don't know yet."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Just not here."
Spike says: "Can't..."
Spike says: "move."
Spike says: "The princess..."
Spike says: "has been sending these..."
Spike says: "since I came back upstairs."
Spike says: "Make it stop!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "These are all the letters I've written to the princess since I've lived in Ponyville."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But why would she send them back?"
Twilight Sparkle says: ""Real friends don't care what your cover is."
Spike! Spike, it's all so clear! Can't you see? Discord's trying to distract us from what's important. He knows how powerful our friendships are, and he's trying to keep us from seeing it. Do you remember what I said the first day we arrived in Ponyville? I told you that the future of Equestria didn't rest on me making friends. But the opposite is true! The friendships I've made since I've been here are what saved Equestria from Nightmare Moon. And now they need to save it from Discord!
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're right, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've got to fight for my friendships."
Twilight Sparkle says: "For them."
Twilight Sparkle says: "For me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "For Equestria!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "uh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "why don't you just stay here and rest?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll take care of the whole fighting for friendship thing myself."
Applejack says: "And so I tried to defeat Discord, but none of my so-called "friends" would lift a hoof to help me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack, I'm here to fight for our friendship."
Applejack says: "Oh, now you want to fight."
Applejack says: "Where were you when I was battlin' Discord?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Snap out of it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This isn't you!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're not a liar."
Applejack says: "Wh-what happened?"
Applejack says: "Twilight!"
Applejack says: "I saw a vision of us feudin' and fightin'."
Applejack says: "I couldn't face the truth, so I started tellin' lies."
Applejack says: "Can you ever forgive me?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I already have."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Come on!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh no!"
Fluttershy says: "Twilight, Applejack, I just had the worst dream!"
Rarity says: "What do you think you're doing?"
Rarity says: "Get away from my gem!"
Rarity says: "Get away--!"
Rarity says: "Let us never speak of this again."
Pinkie Pie says: "Can you believe it?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Uh?"
Fluttershy says: "She's not here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Without Rainbow Dash, we can't use the Elements."
Applejack says: "She could be anywhere by now!"
Applejack says: "We're never gonna find her."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah, we will, 'cause she's right there!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, guys!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We've been looking everywhere for you!"
Rainbow Dash says: "That's nice."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Discord's still on the loose!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We need you to help us defeat him with your element, Loyalty!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pfft."
Rainbow Dash says: "Loyalty, schmoyalty!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Have you guys seen Ponyville?"
Rainbow Dash says: "It's a disaster!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm staying here in Cloudsdale where everything's awesome."
Rarity says: "How in Equestria can she think that tiny patch of clouds is Cloudsdale?"
Applejack says: "The same way he got you to think that cheap rock was a bona fide diamond."
Rarity says: "I thought we agreed never to speak of that again."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Time for Plan B."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, Fluttershy, you grab Rainbow Dash and hold her down."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack will lower me down from this rope so I can cast the memory spell on her."
Fluttershy says: "Got it!"
Fluttershy says: "Um..."
Fluttershy says: "I'm just wondering if it's okay if I hold you down against your will for a little bit?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Nice try!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ponyville's your problem, not mine."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Come on, Fluttershy, we've got to catch her."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hyah!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack!"
Rarity says: "WHOA!"
Pinkie Pie says: "WHOA!"
Rarity says: "PINKIE!"
Rarity says: "You were supposed to secure the ROPE!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oops."
Applejack says: "Rarity, Pinkie, hold on!"
Applejack says: "Y'all are slowing her down!"
Rarity says: "Oh, Fluttershy, would you be a dear and FLY FASTER, please?"
Fluttershy says: "I can't!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "If you can't catch her, Discord wins!"
Fluttershy says: "That big..."
Fluttershy says: "dumb..."
Fluttershy says: "MEANIE!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, Applejack, last rope!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Make it count!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Lemme go!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I don't need you guys!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Leave me alone!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wh-what happened?"
Rainbow Dash says: "How's Ponyville?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Where are the Elements?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Did we stop Discord?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Maybe it's a little early for a group hug."
Discord says: "Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not as wonderful as friendship."
Discord says: "Oh, this again?"
Applejack says: "That's right."
Applejack says: "You couldn't break apart our friendship for long."
Discord says: "Oh, Applejack."
Discord says: "Don't lie to me."
Discord says: "I'm the one who made you a liar."
Discord says: "Will you ever learn?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll tell you what we've learned, Discord: we've learned that friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt it's worth fighting for!"
Discord says: "Ugh, gag."
Discord says: "Fine, go ahead."
Discord says: "Try and use your little Elements."
Discord says: "Friend me."
Discord says: "Just make it quick."
Discord says: "I'm missing some excellent chaos here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "All right, ladies, let's show him what friendship can do!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait-wait-wait!"
Discord says: "Huh."
Discord says: "What's this?"
Discord says: "No."
Discord says: "NO!!!"
Princess Celestia says: "We are gathered here today to once again honor the heroism of these six friends who stood up to the villain Discord and saved Equestria from eternal chaos."
