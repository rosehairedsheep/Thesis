Scootaloo says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Scootaloo says: "Almost..."
Scootaloo says: "there..."
Apple Bloom says: "Ah!"
Apple Bloom says: "I can't wait!"
Apple Bloom says: "Twilight's school is supposed to be amazin' inside!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Rarity says there's never been a school like it!"
Scootaloo says: "I heard the students get to do tons of awesome stuff!"
Apple Bloom says: "Do ya see anything yet?"
Scootaloo says: "Uh, yeah."
Scootaloo says: "It looks like a broom!"
Scootaloo says: "And a dustpan and some buckets."
Sweetie Belle says: "That sounds like a closet."
Apple Bloom says: "Try another window."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Scootaloo says: "Whoa..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Whooooo's ready for cupcakes?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, they're not for you, silly."
Pinkie Pie says: "They're for sharing!"
Pinkie Pie says: "First, say something nice like this."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ocellus, you are a great listener!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Now you get to keep one cupcake and share one with another creature."
Ocellus says: "Yona, you're really strong!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ugh!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Whoa!"
Fluttershy says: "All right, students!"
Fluttershy says: "It's time to meet some new friends!"
Applejack says: "Incomin'!"
Applejack says: "That's friendship in action, y'all!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Wow!"
Sweetie Belle says: "And I thought our school was fun!"
Scootaloo says: "Yeah!"
Scootaloo says: "Miss Cheerilee never lets us play buckball in class."
Scootaloo says: "I know."
Scootaloo says: "I've tried."
Apple Bloom says: "Hey!"
Apple Bloom says: "Why don't we go here instead?"
Apple Bloom says: "It's still school, right?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Great idea!"
Apple Bloom says: "What could be better than learnin' friendship with your best friends?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Learning friendship with your best friends..."
Pinkie Pie says: "and cake!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Good morning, class."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Today, we're going to learn about friendship through the ages."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, slide one, please."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Back in the days of Chancellor Puddinghead..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh, Spike?"
Spike says: "Huh?"
Spike says: "Sorry, Twilight."
Spike says: "Still getting used to my new wings."
Spike says: "They're pretty great, huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "As I was saying..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are you three doing here?"
Apple Bloom says: "We wanna go to your school!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But why?"
Sweetie Belle says: "We wanna learn friendship!"
Scootaloo says: "And play buckball!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I see."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why don't you three come with me?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, you're in charge."
Spike says: "Yes!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Hi, Twilight!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Looks like you could use a guidance counselor's help!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Hint, hint."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, thanks, Starlight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've got this."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Great."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Well, I'll just..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "go dust my office for the seventieth time."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "you can't be my students."
Sweetie Belle says: "Why not?"
Scootaloo says: "Isn't this place for everycreature?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes, but we teach friendship lessons here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You already know all about helping ponies in need and being there for each other."
Sweetie Belle says: "Can't you just give us a chance?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Pleeeeeeeeeeeaaaase?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You need Cheerilee's classes, not mine."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hurry up."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You don't want late marks on your permanent record."
Students says: "O dragon!"
Students says: "My dragon!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What did you do?"
Scootaloo says: "Well, I'm not giving up!"
Scootaloo says: "I know we can prove we belong in this school!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Yeah!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Um..."
Sweetie Belle says: "how?"
Apple Bloom says: "By showin' Twilight we've still got lots to learn about friendship."
Apple Bloom says: "And I know just where to start."
Applejack says: "What in tarnation?"
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom!"
Applejack says: "You know better than to leave our good tools out like that!"
Applejack says: "And aren't you supposed to be on harvest duty right now?"
Apple Bloom says: "Eh, it's not like the apples are goin' anywhere."
Applejack says: "What's gotten into you?"
Applejack says: "Those chores are your responsibility!"
Applejack says: "Farm work is family work!"
Apple Bloom says: "Sorry, Applejack."
Apple Bloom says: "Maybe if I went to Twilight's school, I'd learn to be better at helpin' the family."
Applejack says: "Ahhh."
Applejack says: "So that's what this is all about."
Applejack says: "Well, if it's learnin' you want, I'd be happy to give you a private lesson right now..."
Applejack says: "Startin' with cleanin' up all this equipment!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hmph!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Please can I go to Twilight's school?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Please?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Please?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
Rarity says: "I'm going to call you "Repeatie Belle"!"
Rarity says: "We've been through this!"
Rarity says: "Please let me concentrate!"
Sweetie Belle says: "How 'bout now?"
Rainbow Dash says: "So there I was, leading the Wonderbolt formation into a super dangerous Sundown Spiral, when suddenly..."
Rainbow Dash says: "There was a huge storm cloud in our way!"
"Citrine Spark" says: "What happened?"
Rainbow Dash says: "My genius happened!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I changed the routine on the fly!"
Rainbow Dash says: "And because my crew are such tight friends, they followed me!"
"Berry Bliss" says: "What did you do?!"
"Berry Bliss" says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Only the coolest thing ever!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I flew up andâ€”"
Scootaloo says: "Did a super-amazing half-twist into a backflip sonic rainboom?!"
Scootaloo says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I never told that story to my students before."
Rainbow Dash says: "Scootaloo!"
Sweetie Belle says: "They're coming!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Get ready!"
Scootaloo says: "Look out!"
Apple Bloom says: "Look out!"
Apple Bloom says: "Whoa!"
Scootaloo says: "Hey!"
Scootaloo says: "Watch where you are going!"
Apple Bloom says: "I was watching!"
Apple Bloom says: "Watching you drive like a crazy pony!"
Scootaloo says: "Well, maybe if you did not drop apples all over the street, I would not have to!"
Fluttershy says: "Ooh."
Fluttershy says: "I've never seen Apple Bloom and Scootaloo argue like this."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah."
Pinkie Pie says: "They usually go together like candy canes and stripes."
Sweetie Belle says: "Whoa!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Oof!"
Apple Bloom says: "My apples?"
Apple Bloom says: "This is all your fault, Scootaloo!"
Scootaloo says: "Hey, Sweetie Belle is the clumsy one!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I'm not talking to either one of you ever again!"
Fluttershy says: "Goodness."
Fluttershy says: "They seem really upset."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's almost like they forgot they're friends."
Scootaloo says: "I think it's working!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Good plan, Apple Bloom!"
Apple Bloom says: "And great acting, Sweetie Belle!"
Scootaloo says: "We're an awesome team!"
Apple Bloom says: "All right!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yay!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oops."
Pinkie Pie says: "You're friends again!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I knew you would be!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Candy cane stripes forever!"
Scootaloo says: "Now they'll never let us into Twilight's school."
Apple Bloom says: "Okay, we've tried shirkin' chores, pesterin', disguises, fightin'."
Sweetie Belle says: "Hmmm..."
Sweetie Belle says: "We need to do something new."
Sweetie Belle says: "Something unexpected."
Apple Bloom says: "Great idea, Scootaloo!"
Apple Bloom says: "We haven't tried cryin' yet."
Sweetie Belle says: "Yeah!"
Sweetie Belle says: "It always works for Rarity."
Scootaloo says: "I wasn't crying."
Scootaloo says: "I think it's coming from outside."
Sweetie Belle says: "Aww."
Sweetie Belle says: "She looks so sad."
Sweetie Belle says: "We better go see what's wrong."
Apple Bloom says: "Hey."
Apple Bloom says: "Are you okay?"
Cozy Glow says: "Oh."
Cozy Glow says: "Thank you for asking."
Cozy Glow says: "But no."
Cozy Glow says: "I'm having real trouble with..."
Cozy Glow says: "..."
Cozy Glow says: "the School of Friendship."
Scootaloo says: "Twilight won't let you go either, huh?"
Cozy Glow says: "Oh, no, it's not that."
Cozy Glow says: "I'm in her class, but..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Really?"
Cozy Glow says: "I just moved here to go to school, but everything's so new and different."
Cozy Glow says: "I don't know anypony."
Apple Bloom says: "Well, now you do."
Apple Bloom says: "I'm Apple Bloom."
Apple Bloom says: "This is Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo."
Apple Bloom says: "We're the Cutie Mark Crusaders."
Cozy Glow says: "I'm Cozy Glow."
Cozy Glow says: "It's very nice to meet you, but I don't know if I'll stay long."
Cozy Glow says: "I'll probably flunk out."
Cozy Glow says: "I'm having so much trouble with my friendship lessons."
Sweetie Belle says: "We can help with those!"
Scootaloo says: "We know all about friendship!"
Apple Bloom says: "And studyin' with you would be almost as good as bein' in class!"
Cozy Glow says: "But why would you help me?"
Cozy Glow says: "What's in it for you?"
Sweetie Belle says: "That's how friendship works."
Sweetie Belle says: "When you give from your heart, you don't expect anything back."
Cozy Glow says: "Well, golly, if you really mean it..."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Uh-huh!"
Cozy Glow says: "I could use some help with my homework."
Cozy Glow says: "I have to do something nice for each of these ponies."
Cozy Glow says: "But I don't know anything about them."
Cozy Glow says: "And it's so hard to talk to ponies you've never met."
Apple Bloom says: "Well, you're in luck, 'cause we know all of those ponies!"
Scootaloo says: "Get ready for a friendship A-plus!"
Scootaloo says: "That's Bon Bon."
Scootaloo says: "If you wanna do something nice for her, first you gotta figure out what she needs."
Cozy Glow says: "Well, how am I supposed to do that?"
Scootaloo says: "Just pay attention."
Scootaloo says: "Friendship is about listening to others."
Sweetie Drops says: "Ow."
Sweetie Drops says: "Ow."
Scootaloo says: "Uh-oh."
Scootaloo says: "That cactus keeps pricking her every step she takes."
Scootaloo says: "Hmm, if only there was something to protect her from those spines."
Cozy Glow says: "It looks like you need help carrying your cactus, so here's a safe way to take it home."
Sweetie Drops says: "Thank you!"
Sweetie Drops says: "That's so thoughtful."
Cozy Glow says: "I did it!"
Scootaloo says: "Good job!"
Scootaloo says: "But, uh, next time, maybe don't give away my helmet."
Cozy Glow says: "Oopsie."
Sweetie Belle says: "Green, purple, yellow."
Sweetie Belle says: "And one more purple."
Sweetie Belle says: "Whew."
Sweetie Belle says: "Sorting all those took longer than I thought."
Cozy Glow says: "You really think Mrs."
Cozy Glow says: "Cake will like these new sprinkle shakers?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Mm-hmm."
Sweetie Belle says: "Now she won't have to use rainbow sprinkles all the time."
Sweetie Belle says: "She can just pick the color she wants!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Ooh!"
Mrs. Cake says: "I'm sorry, I was out to lunch."
Mrs. Cake says: "Were you fillies waiting for me long?"
Cozy Glow says: "No."
Cozy Glow says: "Um, these are for you!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Oh, well, what a lovely surprise!"
Mrs. Cake says: "I can't wait to try them out!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Look!"
Mrs. Cake says: "I made rainbow sprinkles!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Aren't they wonderful?"
Cozy Glow says: "But..."
Cozy Glow says: "she..."
Cozy Glow says: "I..."
Sweetie Belle says: "At least she likes her present?"
Cozy Glow says: "Uh-huh..."
Cozy Glow says: "Golly."
Cozy Glow says: "How'd you know that would make him so happy?"
Apple Bloom says: "Friendship means pitchin' in to help others' chores go faster."
Apple Bloom says: "'Specially when their special somepony's waitin' for 'em."
Scootaloo says: "That class was so boring!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Not even Miss Cheerilee can make the history of radishes exciting."
Apple Bloom says: "I bet they don't have to learn about that stuff at Twilight's school."
Cozy Glow says: "Guess what!"
Cozy Glow says: "I got an A on my homework!"
Apple Bloom says: "Nice goin'!"
Cozy Glow says: "And I never could have done it without your help!"
Sweetie Belle says: "No problem!"
Scootaloo says: "We just wish we could have done more."
Cozy Glow says: "Actually, you can."
Cozy Glow says: "Headmare Twilight is giving us a big test at the end of the week, and I could really use your help studying."
Apple Bloom says: "We wanted to go to Twilight's school more than anything."
Apple Bloom says: "But helpin' you has been even more fun!"
Apple Bloom says: "You can count on us!"
Angel munching.
Cozy Glow says: "Um..."
Cozy Glow says: "intelligence?"
Cozy Glow says: "Laughter?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Yes!"
Cozy Glow says: "Is it..."
Cozy Glow says: "control?"
Cozy Glow says: "Kindness!"
Cozy Glow says: "Loyalty!"
Cozy Glow says: "Honesty!"
Cozy Glow says: "Generosity!"
Cozy Glow says: "Laughter!"
Cozy Glow says: "Magic!"
Apple Bloom says: "How'd the test go?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Were there essay questions?"
Scootaloo says: "Did you remember what we taught you?"
Cozy Glow says: "I..."
Cozy Glow says: "failed!"
Apple Bloom says: "But how could Cozy Glow fail her friendship test?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ahem."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'd like to see you three in my office!"
Scootaloo says: "I know we wanted to be invited inside, but it kinda went different in my head."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can't believe you'd do something like this!"
Apple Bloom says: "Like what?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You are Cozy Glow's tutors, aren't you?"
Scootaloo says: "We've been working with her for days!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's what she told me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So you've been setting her up to fail?"
Sweetie Belle says: "What?!"
Scootaloo says: "What?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "How?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know you're upset that I won't let you come to my school, but to teach Cozy all the wrong things out of spite..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's just cruel!"
Sweetie Belle says: "But we taught her all the right things!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Then how do you explain these friendship test answers?"
Twilight Sparkle says: ""What are the six Elements of Harmony?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "" Five turtlenecks and a cheese grater?"
Twilight Sparkle says: ""Who is the Princess of Friendship?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "" Your mom?"
Apple Bloom says: "I..."
Apple Bloom says: "I don't understand."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Me neither."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I never thought you three would pull such a mean prank."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to stay away from my school."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And my students."
Cozy Glow says: "Oh, no!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Hmm?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Not much need for a guidance counselor at a school of friendship."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Aah!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "How much of that did you hear?!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Uh, never mind."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Welcome!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Can I get you a comfort pillow?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Security blanket?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Empathy cocoa?"
Cozy Glow says: "Uh, I just need some advice."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Oh!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Well, I have plenty of that!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Anecdotes, insight, midnight confessions..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I'm babbling."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Go ahead."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I'm listening."
Cozy Glow says: "I think I got my friends in trouble."
Cozy Glow says: "They helped me study for my friendship test, and I failed it..."
Cozy Glow says: "on purpose."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Why would you do that?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Uh, sorry."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Listening."
Cozy Glow says: "Well, the Cutie Mark Crusaders wanted to go to this school more than anything."
Cozy Glow says: "So I thought if I showed Headmare Twilight they're bad at friendship, she'd let them come here with me."
Starlight Glimmer says: "That's devious."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I-I mean, I see."
Cozy Glow says: "I guess I still have a lot to learn about friendship."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Actually, I think you're doing all right."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Sure, that was a really, really bad way to try to help your friends, but what matters is you wanted to."
Starlight Glimmer says: "The reason the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't go to this school is because they'd make better teachers than students."
Cozy Glow says: "So you do have a place for them here?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Hmmm..."
Apple Bloom says: "I bet there's no "Wonderful World of Cleaning" lesson at Twilight's school."
Sweetie Belle says: "We'll never find out now."
Scootaloo says: "I still don't get how Cozy failed her test after all that studying."
Sweetie Belle says: "Or how Twilight could blame us for it!"
Apple Bloom says: "Or how gum can be so sticky!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Sorry to interrupt, Miss Cheerilee."
Starlight Glimmer says: "But can I borrow Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo?"
Scootaloo says: "We didn't do anything wrong!"
Scootaloo says: "We promise!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know that."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Which is why I wanted to talk to you."
Sweetie Belle says: "Wait."
Sweetie Belle says: "So we're not in trouble?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Just the opposite."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Cozy Glow, is there something you'd like to say?"
Cozy Glow says: "This is all my fault."
Cozy Glow says: "I messed up my test on purpose so we could all go to school together."
Cozy Glow says: "I'm sorry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thank you, Cozy Glow."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Honesty is one of the pillars of friendship."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But you already know that."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Which is why I'd like to give you these."
Applejack says: "They're honorary diplomas, makin' y'all official graduates of this here school."
Rarity says: "You've more than earned them."
Rainbow Dash says: "Without even having to study!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "We are graduates!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "We are graduates!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "We are graduates!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And if you're interested, I think Starlight has a place for you at my school after all."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Woo-hoo!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "We could use some friendship tutors on staff."
Starlight Glimmer says: "And I hear you're the best out there."
Apple Bloom says: "Then what are we waitin' for?"
Apple Bloom says: "Let's get tutorin'!"
Apple Bloom says: "Come on, Cozy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And that's why this school needs you as our guidance counselor."
