Spike says: "Is the banner even?"
Spike says: "Are the flowers in place?"
Spike says: "By which I mean "completely out of view"."
Spike says: "I'm pretty sure dragons don't like flowers."
Spike says: "And what about the Ceremonial Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship?"
Spike says: "Is it still flaming?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, everything looks great!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're getting yourself worked up for no reason."
Spike says: "I have lots of reasons."
Spike says: "In fact, I wrote them down."
Starlight Glimmer says: "You've been hanging around Twilight for too long."
Spike says: "Reason number one – I invited Dragon Lord Ember to Ponyville today."
Spike says: "Reason two – the Dragon Lord is a dragon."
Spike says: "Reason three – she's coming here to learn more about friendship."
Twilight Sparkle says: "According to Ember's letters, the dragons are trying to be friends, but competing is in their nature, and it's leading to more and more fights."
Spike says: "Which brings me to to reason number four."
Spike says: "The Dragon Lord wants my advice, and as the new official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons, I can't let her down."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know you feel a lot of pressure, but you've got this, Spike!"
Spike says: "I..."
Spike says: "I just want things to be perfect."
Spike says: "Thorax!"
Spike says: "You're in Ponyville!"
Thorax says: "Of course I am, silly!"
Thorax says: "You invited me."
Thorax says: "And I'm not one to back out of an invitation."
Thorax says: "Hey, Twilight!"
Thorax says: "Hey, Starlight!"
Thorax says: "Oooh!"
Thorax says: "I can't believe you did all this for me!"
Thorax says: "Great banner!"
Thorax says: "Love the stage!"
Thorax says: "What's this flame thingy?"
Thorax says: "Oh, it's pretty!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You invited Thorax over to Ponyville on the same day as Ember?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Spike says: "Apparently."
Starlight Glimmer says: "That doesn't seem like a good idea."
Starlight Glimmer says: "How are you gonna entertain them both?"
Spike says: "I have no idea."
Spike says: "I completely forgot!"
Spike says: "Thorax wrote and said he needed to talk, and I told him to come over."
Spike says: "I didn't realize it was the same day I invited Ember!"
Spike says: "What am I gonna do?!"
Spike says: "!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Well, maybe they'll like each other."
Spike says: "Probably not."
Spike says: "Ember is tough and self-assured and intimidating."
Spike says: "And Thorax is..."
Thorax says: "Spike, I'm so glad you invited me!"
Thorax says: "You are one of my closest, nicest, most caring, most understanding friends ever!"
Thorax says: "Ooh!"
Thorax says: "Is that ice in the shape of a dragon?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Yeah, I see your point."
Starlight Glimmer says: "They might not get each other."
Spike says: "Or worse – they'll hate each other!"
Spike says: "And if the leader of the changelings and the Dragon Lord get into a fight..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm sure that won't happen."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now pull it together."
Spike says: "So, heh, Thorax, heh, everything good with you?"
Thorax says: "Well, honestly, no."
Thorax says: "Not really."
Thorax says: "I have indigestion."
Thorax says: "Not sure if it's the new diet or stress."
Thorax says: "Or maybe it's both."
Spike says: "No!"
Thorax says: "Yeah, it really could be both."
Thorax says: "And it might be affecting my sleeping, too."
Thorax says: "I'm a real tosser and turner."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh-oh!"
Spike says: "Sounds like you really need to unwind."
Spike says: "Uh, how about a, uh..."
Spike says: "a trip to the castle?"
Spike says: "Heh."
Spike says: "You can't miss that view."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes, the castle!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll give you a personal tour!"
Thorax says: "Uh, aren't you coming?"
Spike says: "Yeah, I'm just gonna..."
Spike says: "grab some ice cream for us and catch up."
Spike says: "Heh-heh."
Spike says: "Dragon Lord Ember, as the official Equestrian friendship ambassador for the Dragon Lands and for Ponyville, I, Spike of Ponyville, welcome you to..."
Spike says: "uh, Ponyville."
Spike says: "I gotta work on my official speech."
Ember says: "Okay, thanks."
Ember says: "Right."
Ember says: "The hug thing."
Ember says: "This place has a lot of colors."
Ember says: "In the Dragon Lands, everything's just rocks or the color of ash."
Ember says: "That's probably why."
Ember says: "Hey, Twilight!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Actually, I'm Starlight."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Starlight Glimmer."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Nice to meet you."
Ember says: "Oh, sorry."
Ember says: "I'm really gonna have to get used to these pony names."
Ember says: "Lots of "-lights" and shiny things."
Ember says: "So, where is Twilight?"
Spike says: "She's in her castle."
Spike says: "D'oh!"
Ember says: "We should go visit her then."
Ember says: "Part of friendship is saying "hi" to your friends, right?"
Spike says: "Uh, well, yeah, but..."
Ember says: "You're making weird noises."
Ember says: "Do you have a stomachache?"
Spike says: "Dah."
Spike says: "I think I feel one coming on."
Ember says: "Well, you know what us dragons say."
Ember says: ""Push past the pain!"
Ember says: "" Now, let's go."
Spike says: "Or we could stay here."
Ember says: "Or I could go without you."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Ah, I like her."
Spike says: "Ohhh."
Spike says: "Good."
Spike says: "They're not here."
Ember says: "What was that?"
Spike says: "Uh, I..."
Spike says: "I said, "It's all clean in here!"
Spike says: "" Uh, you must be hungry from your travels."
Spike says: "Please, I'd love to present you with an official friendship welcome banquet."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Actually, that's not food."
Spike says: "Dragons love gems!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Fine, but you're telling Twilight what happened to her wall."
Spike says: "Just keep her here."
Spike says: "Enjoy all the, uh..."
Spike says: "crystal..."
Spike says: "things!"
Ember says: "Where are you going?"
Ember says: "I thought this was an official friendship banquet."
Spike says: "Just gotta use the little dragons' room!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "So this is my comfy chair for fictional reads."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is my studying chair because the hard back keeps me awake."
Thorax says: "Oh, Spike!"
Thorax says: "I'm so glad you're here!"
Thorax says: "This castle visit is getting weird."
Thorax says: "Twilight really likes chairs."
Thorax says: "Oh, what happened to the ice cream?"
Spike says: "What?"
Spike says: "Oh, right!"
Spike says: "Uh, they ran out."
Spike says: "Heh."
Spike says: "Hey, I'm really sorry, but I gotta borrow Twilight quickly."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Aah!"
Spike says: "Be right back!"
Thorax says: "But we didn't get to talk yet!"
Spike says: "Ember's here!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I saw you coming and had to distract Thorax by showing him chairs."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why did you bring Ember to the castle of all places?"
Spike says: "I don't know!"
Spike says: "Ember was asking for you, Thorax wants to talk with me."
Spike says: "We need to switch places!"
Spike says: "They might be getting suspicious."
Twilight Sparkle says: "All we have to do is make both Thorax and Ember feel special and keep them apart for a few more hours."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We can do this."
Spike says: "Dah!"
Spike says: "What's happening?!"
Spike says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I think it's the map."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's calling..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Apparently, you also have to solve a friendship problem!"
Spike says: "The map is calling me?!"
Spike says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, amazing!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The map is really reaching out!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not a good time?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I get it."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Spike, are you here?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Ember's eaten all of Twilight's decorations, and—"
Starlight Glimmer says: "oh!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Hey, Twilight!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Glowing spikes..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "That's not good."
Spike says: "I know!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "At least your friendship problem is in Ponyville?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Heh."
Spike says: "Okay, okay."
Spike says: "To pull this off, I'm gonna need both of you to help."
Spike says: "You two need to keep Ember and Thorax separate while I get ice cream."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You mean "find the friendship problem"."
Spike says: "Yeeeees!"
Spike says: "Go easy on me."
Spike says: "I'm under a lot of pressure."
Spike says: "Friendship problem?"
Spike says: "Anypony gotta friendship problem here?"
Spike says: "Any problems to solve?"
Spike says: "Friendship problems?"
Spike says: "Friendship problems!"
Spike says: "Anypony got a friendship problem here?"
Spike says: "No?"
Spike says: "Okay."
Lyra Heartstrings says: "Well, I think vanilla strawberry cream is overused!"
Sweetie Drops says: "Hmph."
Spike says: "Yes!"
Spike says: "Fighting!"
Spike says: "Uh, I mean, what seems to be the problem?"
Ember says: "Mmm."
Ember says: "Mmm."
Ember says: "I'm stuffed."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ember, there you are!"
Ember says: "Okay, right."
Ember says: "More pony hugs."
Twilight Sparkle says: "How's your trip to Ponyville so far?"
Ember says: "Well, I'm certainly learning a lot about friendship."
Ember says: "I had no idea it was polite to decorate your walls in your friends' favorite foods!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, my."
Ember says: "Where'd Spike and Starlight go?"
Ember says: "I feel like I'm being avoided."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nooooo."
Twilight Sparkle says: "They're just making sure everything is perfect for your welcome party later."
Twilight Sparkle says: "In the meantime, how about I show you around town?"
Ember says: "Sounds good."
Ember says: "I can't exactly learn about friendship if I don't make new friends."
Thorax says: "Oh!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Uh, hey, Thorax."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Um, Twilight and Spike had some boring official paperwork to deal with, so looks like you and I get to hang out."
Starlight Glimmer says: "What would you like to do?"
Thorax says: "But I wanted to talk with Spike."
Thorax says: "He said he'd be right back."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Oh, you will."
Starlight Glimmer says: "But first, how about we grab a bite to eat?"
Thorax says: "Huh."
Thorax says: "Well, you know, now that you've said it, I am a little hungry."
Thorax says: "Is there a dining room in the castle?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "No!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I mean, yeah, but that's castle food."
Starlight Glimmer says: "If you want the good stuff, we gotta go to town."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Phew!"
Spike says: "..."
Spike says: "and that's why you should never let cupcake flavors get in the way of your friendship."
Lyra Heartstrings says: "Huh."
Lyra Heartstrings says: "I guess I never thought of it that way."
Lyra Heartstrings says: "Thanks, Spike!"
Spike says: "Oh, come on!"
Spike says: "Glow!"
Thorax says: "Spike!"
Thorax says: "There you are!"
Thorax says: "Uh, done with your boring paperwork, I see."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Uh-huh."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Uh-huh."
Spike says: "Yep."
Spike says: "I am done with whatever Starlight says I was doing."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Thorax wanted to get out of the castle."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I thought coming to town was a really, really great idea."
Thorax says: "Well, maybe now we can talk."
Spike says: "Uh, sssssure."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I'll leave you guys to it."
Thorax says: "First of all, I want to say thank you for having me over."
Thorax says: "I'm in a bit of a leadership pickle, and I could use some advice."
Spike says: "Well, I definitely want to help you out as quickly as possible."
Thorax says: "Here's my problem."
Thorax says: "There's this renegade group of changelings who still feed off of love."
Thorax says: "Even though I said, "Hey let's not do that anymore," they say, "Hey, this is how we've been doing things for hundreds of years..."
Ember says: "Hello, I am Ember, daughter of Torch, winner of the Gauntlet of Fire, and lord of all dragons!"
Ember says: "Usually when I do that, the dragons are eager to meet me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's not how ponies make friends."
Ember says: "Ah, I get it."
Ember says: "This is a weird friendship thing you ponies do, right?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Uh, you guys are in town, too?"
Ember says: "What are you talking about?"
Ember says: "You've been with me this whole time."
Starlight Glimmer says: "No."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I'm Starlight."
Ember says: "Riiiight."
Ember says: "I'm sorry, but you can't blame me."
Ember says: "You both look and act so much alike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What?!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "What?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "!"
Thorax says: "..."
Thorax says: "and they said to me they just keep saying the same thing."
Thorax says: "You know, I think my leadership problem started in childhood."
Thorax says: "I must've been three when..."
Thorax says: "..."
Thorax says: "three's a different story, a-and you've definitely gotta hear it."
Thorax says: "But the story about my brother was when I was two..."
Thorax says: "or was I one?"
Crusoe Palm says: "This is my seat!"
Crusoe Palm says: "I saw it first!"
"Rainbow Stars" says: "Well, I got here first!"
Spike says: "Thorax, uh, excuse me for a second."
Spike says: "Ponies, please!"
Spike says: "If I may, I think I can help solve this friendship problem."
Spike says: "You two should sit together."
Spike says: "You both like the same place, you both ordered muffins, you're both ponies."
Spike says: "I think if you made a little effort, you'd find—"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "Okay, that had to have done it."
Spike says: "Come on, spikes."
Spike says: "Glow!"
Thorax says: "Hey, that was really great advice."
Thorax says: "So what do you think I should do?"
Spike says: "I'll be right back."
Thorax says: "Great."
Thorax says: "No problem."
Thorax says: "Leave me again."
Thorax says: "It's fine."
Ember says: "I'm just saying you're both purple ponies with purple hair."
Ember says: "You both have cutie marks with sparkly things."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Mine's more of a glimmer."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Heh."
Ember says: "How is that different?"
Ember says: "Oh, good."
Ember says: "Spike."
Ember says: "Can you please tell these two I'm right?"
Ember says: "They look very similar."
Spike says: "Uh..."
Spike says: "Well, y'know, one thing friends do is let something go when it's upsetting somepony else."
Ember says: "But I'm right!"
Ember says: "Besides, who are you to be telling me about friendship?"
Ember says: "I've barely seen you all day!"
Spike says: "Uh, well, I've seen you."
Ember says: "Are you calling me a liar?!"
Ember says: "!"
Thorax says: "Hey!"
Thorax says: "No one yells at my friend!"
Ember says: "Spike, get away from the bear!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Actually, the bear is a changeling."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And he's quite gentle."
Thorax says: "Not anymore!"
Spike says: "My worst fears are happening!"
Spike says: "Noooo!"
Thorax says: "Back away, Spike!"
Thorax says: "I'm not gonna let this dragon harm a scale on your back!"
Ember says: "You back away!"
Ember says: "I'm not gonna let you harm him!"
Ember says: "Wait."
Ember says: "Did you say you're not gonna let me harm Spike?"
Thorax says: "Yeah!"
Ember says: "But that's what I'm doing!"
Thorax says: "Uh, what?"
Ember says: "Yeah, what?"
Spike says: "Equestria as we know it is over!"
Spike says: "The war that pits changeling against dragon is about to begin!"
Spike says: "And it's all my fault!"
Spike says: "My title of Equestria's friendship ambassador is a lie—"
Spike says: "!"
Spike says: "Oh."
Spike says: "Hey."
Spike says: "You guys aren't fighting?"
Ember says: "Why would we be fighting?"
Spike says: "Because I accidentally invited you both over to Ponyville on the same day?"
Ember says: "So what?"
Thorax says: "So what?"
Spike says: "So I..."
Spike says: "was trying to keep you apart because I didn't think you'd get along."
Ember says: "Oh."
Ember says: "I get it."
Ember says: "You thought he wouldn't like me just because I'm a dragon and I'm bad at friendship?"
Spike says: "No, no, of course not!"
Spike says: "But—"
Spike says: "Wait."
Spike says: "Isn't that why you're here?"
Ember says: "I can say I'm bad at friendship."
Ember says: "You can't say it about me!"
Ember says: "You know what?"
Ember says: "I don't wanna talk about it."
Spike says: "Wait, please!"
Spike says: "I'm sorry."
Thorax says: "No, no, it's cool."
Thorax says: "You thought I would be too soft, and someone like Ember would never respect me."
Thorax says: "Just like my own changelings!"
Spike says: "No, that's not it!"
Spike says: "Thorax, wait!"
Spike says: "Oh, no..."
Spike says: "What have I done?"
Ember says: "Why are you still here?"
Thorax says: "Because I'm having trouble leading my pack, so I don't really wanna go home."
Ember says: "Wait, you're in charge?"
Ember says: "Oh, boy."
Ember says: "You need to be more assertive."
Thorax says: "Well, that's my problem."
Thorax says: "I don't know how!"
Thorax says: "I tried asking them to please follow my directions."
Thorax says: "I even offered a prize, and then—"
Ember says: "Shhh!"
Ember says: "Stop talking."
Ember says: "That's how you do it."
Thorax says: "Whoa!"
Thorax says: "That just gave me chills."
Ember says: "I know you have it in you."
Ember says: "You turned into a bear to defend Spike."
Thorax says: "Huh, I guess I can be tough when I'm defending my friends, but when I'm just enforcing my rules, I-I feel unsure of myself."
Ember says: "There's nothing to be unsure of."
Ember says: "You're the leader for a reason."
Ember says: "Make a decision and let it be known that the decision is final."
Ember says: "And if that doesn't work, turn into a bear."
Thorax says: "Oh, well, that's good advice."
Ember says: "I know it is."
Thorax says: "So what's your deal?"
Thorax says: "Why do you think you're so bad at friendship?"
Ember says: "I don't want to talk about it."
Thorax says: "Oh, you have to!"
Thorax says: "How else are you gonna solve your problems?"
Ember says: "Through feats of strength and fire duels, of course."
Thorax says: "Uh, how does that help?"
Ember says: "Crushing another dragon in competition establishes my dominance and makes me feel great."
Thorax says: "Right, but, uh, how do you think they feel?"
Ember says: "Humiliated!"
Ember says: "Ashamed!"
Ember says: "They'd probably wanna run away and bury themselves under a rock and..."
Ember says: "never come out."
Ember says: "They're probably sad."
Ember says: "Kinda low."
Ember says: "Definitely not happy."
Thorax says: "That's because that kind of competition can divide you."
Thorax says: "And it doesn't get to the heart of the issue."
Thorax says: "Talking about your feelings does."
Ember says: "Ugh!"
Ember says: "I think I'm allergic to feelings."
Thorax says: "You know you don't have to be sappy..."
Thorax says: "..."
Thorax says: "or huggy-feely about it!"
Thorax says: "But you should let your friends know how you feel."
Ember says: "Uh, I know where we can start."
Thorax says: "Where?"
Thorax says: "Ohhhh."
Thorax says: "Spike."
Thorax says: "Hah."
Thorax says: "I got there."
Spike says: "I think they're gone."
Spike says: "They probably never want to see me again."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Or they want to see you now."
Ember says: "Guess what, Spike."
Spike says: "I know."
Spike says: "I'm so sorry."
Ember says: "Let me talk about this!"
Ember says: "I..."
Ember says: "feel..."
Thorax says: "Okaaaay..."
Thorax says: "That's a good first attempt."
Thorax says: "Now maybe try to be more specific?"
Ember says: "upset!"
Spike says: "You have every right to be."
Ember says: "I know I do!"
Ember says: "And I know I need to tell you how I feel because my friend Thorax said it would make me feel better."
Ember says: "And it does!"
Thorax says: "Yeah!"
Thorax says: "And I have no problem telling you what you did was wrong because my friend Ember is helping me be more assertive!"
Spike says: "Whoa."
Ember says: "Nice."
Ember says: "Ha-ha!"
Thorax says: "Ha-ha!"
Spike says: "You guys should be mad at me."
Spike says: "I was so worried about how it could go wrong, I didn't even think about how it could go right."
Spike says: "Can you forgive me?"
Ember says: "I really do feel better."
Ember says: "So, yeah."
Ember says: "I'm good."
Thorax says: "Hah."
Thorax says: "Me, too."
Ember says: "Again?"
Spike says: "No way!"
Spike says: "It's finally happening!"
Spike says: "I solved the friendship problem!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Actually, you created the friendship problem by not trusting your friends."
Spike says: "Yeah, but then I solved it by learning my lesson."
Spike says: "I should have told my two friends about each other immediately instead of assuming they wouldn't get along."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Good job, Spike."
Ember says: "Is this another part of pony friendship?"
Ember says: "Telling each other what you learned all the time?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Yeah, pretty much."
Spike says: "Yup."
Spike says: "So, as a show of unity, I present the Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship to both Dragon Lord Ember and Thorax, leader of the changeling pack!"
Spike says: "May the flame of friendship burn for eternity."
Ember says: "You should have more things made of rocks."
