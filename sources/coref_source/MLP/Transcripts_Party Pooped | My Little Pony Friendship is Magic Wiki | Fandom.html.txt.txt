Twilight Sparkle says: "You look nervous."
Twilight Sparkle says: "There's no reason to be nervous."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nothing to worry about."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Everything's gonna be fine!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Twilight, tell those butterflies in your tummy to beat it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Making new friends is always fun."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ohhhh..."
Fluttershy says: "They're probably just as nervous as you are."
Applejack says: "You've been plannin' this shindig for weeks."
Applejack says: "You know everything about these fellers."
Applejack says: "It's gonna be dandy."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm calm!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm calm..."
Prince Rutherford says: "Ponies!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Greetings, ponies!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Prince Rutherford, your Majesty."
Twilight Sparkle says: "On behalf of all of us, I welcome you to Equestria."
Prince Rutherford says: "Me honored."
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks hope for great friendship between ponies and yaks."
Prince Rutherford says: "Friends for a thousand moons!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You must be hungry after a long journey."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We've prepared a banquet of traditional yak foods."
Prince Rutherford says: "If things not perfect, yaks get mad."
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks always get mad when things not perfect!"
Prince Rutherford says: "This no taste like yak food!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Fake pony food make yaks mad!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it okay to be nervous now?"
Applejack says: "Them yaks sure have a funny way of sayin' "howdy."
Rarity says: "They're different, that's all."
Rarity says: "Very..."
Rarity says: "different."
Rainbow Dash says: "I think they broke my record for most stuff broken in under a minute."
Rainbow Dash says: "I mean, they even broke the trophy."
Twilight Sparkle says: "All we have to do is show them how great it can be to have friends before Princess Celestia arrives for the friendship party tonight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now, who read the seven-volume cross-indexed history of Yakyakistan I recommended?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Um..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I-I had a thing..."
Pinkie Pie says: "I did, I did!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Did you know they live so far north of the Crystal Empire that it's cold all the time?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yaks have yak fur to keep them warm."
Applejack says: "Pretty sure that's what fur's always for, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie says: "I know!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yaks are so cool!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie Pie, can you show them around town?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know you have to plan the friendship party too, but it would really help make them feel welcome."
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't worry."
Pinkie Pie says: "They'll be in good hooves with me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Remember, we want to make sure Equestria feels like home."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That means doing everything we can to make this place feel like Yakyakistan."
Pinkie Pie says: "No problem!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Good."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's get out there and make some new friends!"
Applejack says: "We know y'all are noble warriors who avoid the so-called finer things, so me and my family would be honored if you rested here in the barn during your visit."
Pinkie Pie says: "Applejack and I made hay beds like you're used to back in Yakyakistan."
Prince Rutherford says: "Hmm..."
Prince Rutherford says: "This perfect."
Pinkie Pie says: "You can snooze here all afternoon, 'cause you're gonna need a lot of energy for my party tonight!"
Applejack says: "That wasn't so hard."
Prince Rutherford says: "Wait!"
Prince Rutherford says: "This not yak hay!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, we didn't have actual hay from Yakyakistan, but we tried our best to make it just like yours."
Prince Rutherford says: "Not perfect!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks destroy!"
Applejack says: "Pinkie Pie, what do we do?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And now, for your entertainment pleasure..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Presenting animals, Yakyakistan style!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Animals cute."
Fluttershy says: "Oh."
Fluttershy says: "Thank goodness."
Prince Rutherford says: "Wait."
Prince Rutherford says: "These antlers lie!"
Prince Rutherford says: "These not Yakyakistani animals!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks smash!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay, well..."
Pinkie Pie says: "There's still other things we can do."
Pinkie Pie says: "I think."
Rarity says: "Yes!"
Rarity says: "These are some of my favorite materials."
Rarity says: "Very rare, imported from the Crystal Empire to match your northern sensibilities."
Rarity says: "I hope you'll find them—"
Rarity says: "..."
Rarity says: "delicious."
Prince Rutherford says: "This no taste like yak fabric!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks destroy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Everything's gonna be fine."
Pinkie Pie says: "You'll just..."
Pinkie Pie says: "make it up to them."
Pinkie Pie says: "Somehow."
Pinkie Pie says: "Listen up!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Tell your faces to hold onto their frowns, 'cause they're about to get turned upside-down!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Hold your frown, face!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hit it, Rainbow Dash!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Just like Yakyakistan snow, right?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Because snow is snow, no matter where it comes from."
Prince Rutherford says: "This not yak snow!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Seriously?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Seriously?"
Applejack says: "Y'know..."
Applejack says: "it's goin' okay."
Rarity says: "Satisfactory, I'd say."
Rainbow Dash says: "It could be better."
Fluttershy says: "It's not very good."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's a disaster!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie Pie, tonight's Yakyakistan theme party is more important than ever!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You'll make them forget all about this afternoon, right?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Because if it's not perfect, they're gonna smash everything!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And I'm not sure how much more smashing this visit can take!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I definitely will!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I think."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maybe..."
Pinkie Pie says: "?"
Applejack says: "You're the best gosh-darn party planner in Equestria."
Rainbow Dash says: "You'll show 'em a good time!"
Fluttershy says: "You can do it!"
Rarity says: "We have absolute confidence in your abilities, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's going to be my most happy-tacular party ever!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I hope!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Why are your eyes darting around like that?"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's what I do when I'm not nervous!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie Pie, I don't know what we'd do without you—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Me either!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Gotta go!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Gummy, what am I gonna do?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I had all this amazing stuff planned for the party, but they're gonna hate it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "There's no way to make Equestria feel like Yakyakistan."
Pinkie Pie says: "They're just too sensitive!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Even Fluttershy made them mad!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Fluttershy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh..."
Pinkie Pie says: "I need a new idea, and I need it now."
Pinkie Pie says: "How am I supposed to make this party feel like Yakyakistan without actually going there and bringing something back?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And this is Sugarcube Corner."
Twilight Sparkle says: "They're working hard to make your traditional Yakyakistan cake."
Prince Rutherford says: "Vanilla extract balance very tricky."
Yaks says: "Uh-huh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Do you mind, um, waiting here for one moment?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "How's tonight's party coming?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm doing what I can, but it's really up to you at this point!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where are you?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Did you find her?"
Fluttershy says: "Angel and I searched the forest, but..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Aerial recon turned up nothing either."
Applejack says: "I searched the farm inside and out."
Applejack says: "No Pinkie Pie."
Applejack says: "But I did find a set of Granny Smith's dentures under the house, so..."
Applejack says: "not a complete loss."
Rarity says: "She's simply vanished!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But the party!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's all we have left!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are we gonna do?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No reason to freak out!"
Fluttershy says: "Don't worry, Twilight."
Applejack says: "When it comes to parties, I think she knows what she's doin'."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're right."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's just focus on keeping the yaks happy 'til she's back."
Rainbow Dash says: "Piece o' cake."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The cake!"
Mrs. Cake says: "One bite, and you'll be transported right back to Yakyakistan."
Mrs. Cake says: "I hope."
Prince Rutherford says: "Hmm..."
Prince Rutherford says: "Ponies too heavy on vanilla extract!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We've never needed a party so badly."
Conductor says: "Next stop, Crystal Empire!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And so my quest begins."
Pinkie Pie says: "I know what you're thinking."
Pinkie Pie says: ""Why go to Yakyakistan alone, Pinkie Pie?"
Pinkie Pie says: "" Because I'm the party planner."
Pinkie Pie says: "This burden falls on my rump and my rump alone."
Pinkie Pie says: "If I want a great party, I gotta climb the mountains north of the Crystal Empire, find Yakyakistan, and come back with something authentic!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Know what I mean?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Did we go the wrong way?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Where's all the snow?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Please tell me this is magical sand-colored snow."
Pinkie Pie says: "Nope."
Pinkie Pie says: "Sand."
Pinkie Pie says: "Definitely sand."
Conductor says: "Dodge City."
Conductor says: "End of the line, I'm afraid."
Conductor says: "All trains had to stop."
Conductor says: "Sheep decided to sit on the tracks."
Pinkie Pie says: "Curse you, sheep!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Thanks for you help, conductor."
Pinkie Pie says: "Cherry Jubilee!"
Cherry Jubilee says: "Pinkie Pie?!"
Cherry Jubilee says: "!"
Cherry Jubilee says: "I reckoned I eyeballed you crossin' my way right now."
Pinkie Pie says: "How are you?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You look amazing!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I need help."
Cherry Jubilee says: "I'm dandy as a daffodil and fit as a floribunda."
Cherry Jubilee says: "What can I do ya for?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Have you heard of Yakyakistan?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Do you have any idea how I can get there?"
Cherry Jubilee says: "Mark your calendar, missy, 'cause this right here's your lucky day!"
Cherry Jubilee says: "I'm headin' north to the Crystal Empire myself for a delivery."
Cherry Jubilee says: "I ought to warn you though – me and the boys are powerful tired 'cause we was up all night countin' cherries."
Cherry Jubilee says: "Hey there!"
Cherry Jubilee says: "Wake up!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Counting cherries?"
Pinkie Pie says: "How many?"
Cherry Jubilee says: "Four hundred and seventeen thousand, two hundred and thirty-four."
Cherry Jubilee says: "Yee-haw!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoa!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And so my quest resumes."
Pinkie Pie says: "As I stare across the endless desert, I tell myself I will soon triumphantly enter the homeland of our noble guests and return with a prize to make the best party they've ever seen."
Pinkie Pie says: "Know what I mean?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Cherry?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ravine."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ravine!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wake up!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wake up!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Stooooop!"
Cherry Jubilee says: "Huh?!"
Cherry Jubilee says: "!"
Cherry Jubilee says: "Whoa."
Cherry Jubilee says: "I was dreamin' about a ravine."
Cherry Jubilee says: "Ravine!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's what I said."
Prince Rutherford says: "Music beautiful."
Prince Rutherford says: "Much soul."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Phew!"
Spike says: "When Twilight told me to stall—"
Spike says: "I-I mean, entertain you, I thought there's no way I could—"
Yaks says: "Huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Piano play itself?!"
Prince Rutherford says: "!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Music a lie!"
Prince Rutherford says: "We demand party!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Party now or yaks no friends!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Just a little longer!"
Prince Rutherford says: "No more longer!"
Prince Rutherford says: "We leave now!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yak go to train, return with more yaks!"
Prince Rutherford says: "We declare war!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No Pinkie Pie?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's this?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Applejack says: "Heh-heh."
Applejack says: "We panicked and tried to plan our own party."
Rainbow Dash says: "It's sort of panic-themed."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The yaks are going home!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is awful!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I wanted to surprise Princess Celestia."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now the only surprise is that I may have just started a war."
Pinkie Pie says: "There we were, face-to-face with Falling Pony Ravine."
Pinkie Pie says: "Down, down, down!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And then, suddenly..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Pow!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We were rescued mid-air by the Wonderbolts!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And then they gave me a ride to Manehattan, I joined a traveling band, we played some shows here and there, got popular, almost made it big until creative differences tore us apart."
Pinkie Pie says: "And that's when I knew I had to get back on with my journey to the Crystal Empire, the gateway to Yakyakistan!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And so here I am."
Pinkie Pie says: "It was a major adventure that took most of the afternoon."
Pinkie Pie says: "Know what I mean?"
Princess Cadance says: "This is it."
Princess Cadance says: "The northern boundary of the Crystal Empire."
Princess Cadance says: "Beyond lies Yakyakistan."
Princess Cadance says: "Nopony who's attempted this climb has ever returned."
Princess Cadance says: "Are you sure you have to do this?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I do."
Princess Cadance says: "Good luck, Pinkie Pie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "How could she be so late to the party?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This isn't like her."
Fluttershy says: "I'm sure she's trying her best."
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie Pie's tougher than she looks."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know you're right, but..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I wish she was here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I put too much pressure on her."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I let everypony down."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And Princess Celestia will be here any minute and see that I haven't made new friends."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've made new enemies."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hi!"
Pinkie Pie says: "My name is Pinkie Pie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm looking for Yakyakistan."
Pinkie Pie says: "You know, faraway land, lots of yaks?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Maybe you've heard of it?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoa-ho-ho!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Slow down!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I can't understand a word you're saying—"
Pinkie Pie says: "There it is!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yakyakistan!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Noooooooooo..."
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Is everypony alright?"
Fluttershy says: "I can't tell if my eyes are open or closed."
Rainbow Dash says: "I think I can see a little bit."
Rainbow Dash says: "Gah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Nope."
Main cast sans Pinkie says: "Ooooh..."
Applejack says: "Look at these!"
Applejack says: "Pinkie Pie's made files for everypony in town!"
Fluttershy says: "With exactly what kind of parties we like."
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie Pie has a secret party-planning cave?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "How cool is this?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Fluttershy says: ""Twilight Sparkle likes vanilla ice cream, red balloons, dancing..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's right!"
Fluttershy says: ""But she's afraid of quesadillas."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, I'm not!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "They're just so..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "cheesy."
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "oooooooo!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm all the way back where I started!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Gummy, I was this close to helping Twilight befriend the yaks."
Pinkie Pie says: "Now I've just let everypony down."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hmm?"
Applejack says: "Looky here."
Applejack says: "It's notes for the party she wants to throw for her folks' fiftieth anniversary."
Applejack says: "But they ain't nearly that old!"
Applejack says: "Huh."
Applejack says: "She's already plannin' their one-hundredth too."
Applejack says: "And their five-hundredth?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I had no idea she worked so hard on her parties."
Rainbow Dash says: "She may be more organized than you, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's not get carried away."
Rarity says: "I just wish Pinkie Pie were here so we could tell her how much we all appreciate her hard work."
Pinkie Pie says: "Thank you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Thank you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I love you too!"
Pinkie Pie says: "All of you!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're back!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I tried to go to Yakyakistan so I could bring something back for my party."
Pinkie Pie says: "But at the last second, I made a mistake."
Pinkie Pie says: "I worked harder on this party than any party ever."
Pinkie Pie says: "But I'm still just a big failure."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie Pie, you're not a failure."
Fluttershy says: "What matters is how hard you tried."
Rainbow Dash says: "Who else would've gone all across Equestria to plan one party?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You know..."
Pinkie Pie says: "the trip was really hard."
Pinkie Pie says: "But everypony I met along the way was so helpful."
Pinkie Pie says: "I just wish the yaks could see how friendly and wonderful and great Equestria really is!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I just got the best party idea ever!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's too late."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The yaks left on the last train."
Pinkie Pie says: "Um, no, they didn't."
Pinkie Pie says: "Trust me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "There are a whole lot of sheep out there!"
Fluttershy says: "So, um, do we walk back up the slide, or..."
Fluttershy says: "or what?"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks stuck here?!"
Prince Rutherford says: "!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Why trains not work?!"
Prince Rutherford says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I never thought I'd say this, but..."
Pinkie Pie says: "thank you, sheep!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And now, if it's okay with you, it's party time!"
Yaks says: "Ooh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wow, Pinkie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This came together quick, even for you."
Pinkie Pie says: "What can I say?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm good at what I do."
Pinkie Pie says: "Prince Rutherford, every time we tried to make something in Equestria feel like Yakyakistan, we couldn't get it right."
Pinkie Pie says: "When I got back from my adventure, I realized something."
Pinkie Pie says: "We shouldn't try to make Equestria feel like your home."
Pinkie Pie says: "We should try to make you feel at home in Equestria."
Pinkie Pie says: "And that means showing you why we love it here, so you'll love it too."
Prince Rutherford says: "Pink pony work hard to make yaks feel at home."
Prince Rutherford says: "Now yaks happy."
Prince Rutherford says: "No declare war."
Prince Rutherford says: "Ponies and yaks..."
Prince Rutherford says: "friends?"
Pinkie Pie says: "For a thousand moons?"
Prince Rutherford says: "For a thousand moons!"
Princess Celestia says: "I am very impressed, princess."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Heh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Just doing my best to spread friendship."
Princess Celestia says: "And you did a wonderful job of it."
Princess Celestia says: "You and your friends."
Prince Rutherford says: "Pink pony, you understand yaks now."
Pinkie Pie says: "Aww, come here, you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wow!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Too strong!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay, okay, okay!"
