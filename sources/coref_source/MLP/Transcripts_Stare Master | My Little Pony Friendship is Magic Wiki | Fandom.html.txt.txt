Rarity says: "Where'd I put that?"
Rarity says: "Ohh, I thought I already..."
Rarity says: "Ohh, and I can't forget I've got to..."
Rarity says: "oh, how am I ever gonna get this done?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Are you sure I can't help?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I could—"
Rarity says: "No!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Maybe just a—"
Rarity says: "No thanks!"
Sweetie Belle says: "How about—"
Rarity says: "Just stand over there."
Sweetie Belle says: "But—"
Rarity says: "Where you'll be out of the way."
Rarity says: "Ribbon, ribbon!"
Rarity says: "Where's the ribbon?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I got it!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Whoa!"
Rarity says: "Aah!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Um, I-I'll just go and stand over there, where I'll be..."
Sweetie Belle says: "out of the way."
Sweetie Belle says: "Won't you at least let me help you clean up?"
Rarity says: "No."
Rarity says: "You've helped me quite enough."
Sweetie Belle says: "I'm sorry, sis!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I just thought that if I could help, I might find my special gift and finally earn my cutie mark."
Rarity says: "I understand."
Rarity says: "It's just that..."
Rarity says: "I need this time to fill this order without any..."
Rarity says: "complications."
Rarity says: "Okay, all done."
Rarity says: "Now, back to work."
Rarity says: "I've lost a lot of time, and I cannot have any more interruptions."
Rarity says: "Oh, what now?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, sorry."
Fluttershy says: "I thought the "open" sign meant you were open, but I must have been mistaken."
Rarity says: "Fluttershy!"
Rarity says: "Forgive me!"
Rarity says: "I was so wrapped up in my work that I forgot you were bringing Opalescence back from her grooming!"
Fluttershy says: "No worries, Rarity."
Fluttershy says: "I've left her there in the basket."
Rarity says: "Oh, she looks great!"
Rarity says: "I just don't understand how you're able to do it!"
Rarity says: "I can't get near her without getting a swipe from her claws."
Rarity says: "Ahh!"
Rarity says: "Did you use..."
Rarity says: "the Stare on her?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, no!"
Fluttershy says: "I wouldn't!"
Fluttershy says: "I couldn't!"
Fluttershy says: "I-I don't really have any control over when that happens."
Fluttershy says: "I-It just happens."
Fluttershy says: "No, I'm just good with animals."
Fluttershy says: "It's my special gift, you know?"
Rarity says: "Well, you should have a picture of Opal as a cutie mark instead of those butterflies."
Sweetie Belle says: "Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Maybe I can be good with animals, too!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Or not."
Rarity says: "I'm sorry I can't invite you to stay and chat, Fluttershy."
Rarity says: "I've bitten off a bit more than I can chew with this order."
Sweetie Belle says: "But you're not eating anything."
Rarity says: "No, Sweetie, it's an expression."
Rarity says: "It means that I've taken on more work than I can handle."
Rarity says: "I've got twenty of these special robes to make tonight!"
Rarity says: "They're due in Trottingham tomorrow morning."
Rarity says: "See?"
Rarity says: "I've lined them in a special gold silk."
Rarity says: "It took so long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?"
Fluttershy says: "These are lovely, but twenty by tonight?"
Fluttershy says: "How will you get it all done?"
Rarity says: "Well, I, uh..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh, oh, oh!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Maybe I could..."
Sweetie Belle says: "just..."
Sweetie Belle says: "just stand over here and watch."
Rarity says: "I'll manage."
Fluttershy says: "Well, maybe I should get out of your mane so you can work."
Apple Bloom says: "Hi, Fluttershy!"
Scootaloo says: "Hi, Fluttershy!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hi, Rarity!"
Scootaloo says: "Hi, Rarity!"
Rarity says: "Hello, uh, girls..."
Apple Bloom says: "Hey, Sweetie Belle!"
Scootaloo says: "Hey, Sweetie Belle!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Scootaloo!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Apple Bloom!"
Scootaloo says: "You ready for tonight?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Yup!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Cutie mark planning session is a go!"
Apple Bloom says: "Tonight is the night we each try to find our own special talent."
Scootaloo says: "Even if it takes us all night!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm ready!"
Apple Bloom says: "You ready?"
Scootaloo says: "Very ready!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover at Rarity's!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Yay!"
Sweetie Belle says: "And..."
Sweetie Belle says: "look what I made us!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, wow!"
Scootaloo says: "Oh, wow!"
Apple Bloom says: "That's so cool!"
Scootaloo says: "That's so cool!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oooh!"
Scootaloo says: "Oooh!"
Fluttershy says: "What does that patch on your cape mean?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "The Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Yay!"
Scootaloo says: "We're on a crusade, a mission!"
Apple Bloom says: "To find our cutie marks!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Yup."
Sweetie Belle says: "And look."
Sweetie Belle says: "I lined them with this special gold silk."
Sweetie Belle says: "It took sooo long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?"
Apple Bloom says: "Oooooh!"
Scootaloo says: "Oooooh!"
Rarity says: "Sweetie Belle!"
Rarity says: "What have you done?"
Rarity says: "That was the last of the gold silk!"
Rarity says: "Oh, now I'll have to make more!"
Rarity says: "Oh, I hope I can make more."
Rarity says: "I'm gonna have to work all night!"
Rarity says: "Which means..."
Rarity says: "Sorry, girls, I'm afraid the Crusaders sleepover is cancelled."
Sweetie Belle says: "What?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
Rarity says: "I just won't have any time to watch you if I want to get these robes delivered on time."
Sweetie Belle says: "But—"
Rarity says: "No buts this time."
Rarity says: "I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle."
Rarity says: "It's just the way it has to be."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Awwww..."
Fluttershy says: "I, uh, I suppose I could take them for the night."
Rarity says: "I couldn't ask you to do that."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, it's no problem at all."
Rarity says: "Have you met my sister and her friends?"
Rarity says: "A problem is all it would be."
Fluttershy says: "Did I have a problem with Opal?"
Fluttershy says: "You've seen how well I handle small creatures!"
Rarity says: "I suppose that's true..."
Rarity says: "and I do have a lot of work to do..."
Fluttershy says: "Come on, it'll be fun."
Rarity says: "I assure you, they're quite a handful."
Fluttershy says: "These sweet little angels?"
Rarity says: "Well..."
Rarity says: "all right."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover at Fluttershy's cottage!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Yay!"
Fluttershy says: "So cute."
Fluttershy says: "W-wait for me!"
Rarity says: "Hmmm..."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, won't this be ever so fun?"
Fluttershy says: "We can have a nice little tea party, and braid each others' tails, and sit quietly and color, and tell each other fairy tales, and—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hello, Fluttershy."
Fluttershy says: "Oh!"
Fluttershy says: "Hello, Twilight."
Fluttershy says: "Where are you off to?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm heading to the Everfree Forest to Zecora's to get some of my favorite tea."
Fluttershy says: "Th-The Everfree Forest?"
Fluttershy says: "Ah, you'll be careful, won't you?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Of course!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "How about you?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are you doing with the girls?"
Fluttershy says: "Rarity has a big order to fill tonight, so I volunteered to take the girls over to my cottage for a sleepover."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wow."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sounds like everypony has their hooves full today."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Taking care of those three fillies all by yourself?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You sure you can handle it?"
Fluttershy says: "What?"
Fluttershy says: "These sweet little angels?"
Fluttershy says: "They'll be no problem at all."
Sweetie Belle says: "Wow!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Look at this place!"
Sweetie Belle says: "What's that?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Are those chickens?"
Fluttershy says: "Okay, girls, uh, what should we do?"
Scootaloo says: "I'm gonna get my mark first!"
Fluttershy says: "Girls?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Nuh-uh!"
Fluttershy says: "Should we—"
Apple Bloom says: "I am!"
Fluttershy says: "Girls, okay, now settle—"
Scootaloo says: "I'm staying up all night!"
Apple Bloom says: "Me, too!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Me, three!"
Fluttershy says: "I-I know you're excited, but—"
Fluttershy says: "girls, oh, oh, careful with the—"
Fluttershy says: "oh, ah, girls—"
Fluttershy says: "So!"
Fluttershy says: "What do you wanna do?"
Fluttershy says: "Play a game?"
Scootaloo says: "We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Apple Bloom says: "And we want to crusade for our cutie marks!"
Sweetie Belle says: "And, and, and, we, um—"
Sweetie Belle says: "yeah!"
Sweetie Belle says: "What they said!"
Fluttershy says: "Mmm, I don't know..."
Fluttershy says: "how about a nice quiet little tea party?"
Scootaloo says: "Or..."
Scootaloo says: "we could go adventuring in the Everfree Forest!"
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Yeah!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, no!"
Fluttershy says: "The Everfree Forest is much too dangerous."
Fluttershy says: "It's filled with far too many strange creatures."
Sweetie Belle says: "But you could go with us and we could catch those creatures."
Sweetie Belle says: "We could be, umm..."
Sweetie Belle says: "creature catchers!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Yay!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Cutie Mark Crusader creature catchers!"
Scootaloo says: "Arrrr!"
Scootaloo says: "I am a dangerous creature from the Everfree Forest!"
Scootaloo says: "Rrrarr!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Halt, dangerous creature of the Everfree Forest."
Sweetie Belle says: "I am Sweetie Belle, the creature catcher, and I'm here to catch you!"
Scootaloo says: "You can never catch me!"
Scootaloo says: "I am far too powerful and dangerous!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You cannot run from me!"
Scootaloo says: "Raaaar!"
Scootaloo says: "Raaaar!"
Fluttershy says: "Um, oh, maybe that's not such a—"
Fluttershy says: "now, girls, how about we do some nice coloring?"
Fluttershy says: "Doh—"
Sweetie Belle says: "Come back, dangerous creature, so I can catch you!"
Scootaloo says: "Never!"
Fluttershy says: "Careful..."
Fluttershy says: "you don't..."
Fluttershy says: "..."
Fluttershy says: "break anything."
Sweetie Belle says: "Sorry, Fluttershy."
Scootaloo says: "Yeah, sorry."
Apple Bloom says: "I guess we aren't creature catchers."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, girls, it's okay."
Fluttershy says: "I—"
Apple Bloom says: "I know!"
Apple Bloom says: "We could be Cutie Mark Crusader carpenters!"
Fluttershy says: "C-carpenters?"
Apple Bloom says: "Hammer!"
Scootaloo says: "Hammer."
Sweetie Belle says: "Hammer!"
Scootaloo says: "Hammer."
Scootaloo says: "Hammer!"
Scootaloo says: "..."
Scootaloo says: "Hammer."
Sweetie Belle says: "Um..."
Sweetie Belle says: "that doesn't look like a table."
Scootaloo says: "We were making a table?"
Apple Bloom says: "Somepony needs to put this thing out of its misery."
Scootaloo says: "We are definitely not Cutie Mark Carpenters."
Sweetie Belle says: "Who wants a picture of a hammer on their flank anyway?"
Fluttershy says: "Well, now that we've gotten that out of the way, how about a game?"
Apple Bloom says: "A game?"
Fluttershy says: "It's called "Shhh!"
Scootaloo says: "What's that?"
Fluttershy says: "Well, it's a game about who can be quiet the longest."
Fluttershy says: "Sound fun?"
Fluttershy says: "I'm the world champ, you know."
Fluttershy says: "I bet you can't beat me!"
Scootaloo says: "I lose!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Me too!"
Apple Bloom says: "Me three!"
Apple Bloom says: "Okay, now what can we do?"
Apple Bloom says: "Oooh!"
Apple Bloom says: "How about Cutie Mark Crusader coal miners?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Yeah!"
Fluttershy says: "No!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Awwww!"
Fluttershy says: "I mean, it's time for bed, don't you think?"
Fluttershy says: "Aren't you excited to get all toasty and warm in your snuggly-wuggly widdle beds?"
Apple Bloom says: "Snuggly-wuggly?"
Apple Bloom says: "But we have more crusadin' to do!"
Scootaloo says: "We've got plans!"
Sweetie Belle says: "And capes!"
Fluttershy says: "Um, okay, um."
Fluttershy says: "Maybe the crusading can wait until morning?"
Fluttershy says: "When it's light?"
Fluttershy says: "And not so..."
Fluttershy says: "dark?"
Apple Bloom says: "How are we gonna find our special talent in our sleep?"
Fluttershy says: "Maybe you'll have a lovely little dream about your special talent."
Scootaloo says: "But we're not even tired!"
Fluttershy says: "How about I sing you a lullaby?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Mm-hmm, yeah!"
Fluttershy.
Hush now, quiet now.
It's time to lay your sleepy head.
Hush now, quiet now.
It's time to go to bed.
Sweetie Belle says: "I know this one!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, how wonderful!"
Fluttershy says: "Why don't you sing it with me?"
Sweetie Belle.
Hush now! Quiet now!
It's time to lay your sleepy head!
Said hush now! Quiet now!
It's time to go to bed!
Fluttershy says: "Okay Sweetie, that was..."
Sweetie Belle.
Driftin' driftin' off to sleep!
Exciting day behind you!
Driftin' driftin' off to sleep!
Let the joy of dream land find you!
Fluttershy says: "Thank you Sweetie, um..."
Sweetie Belle.
Hush now! Quiet now!
Lay your sleepy head!
Said hush now! Quiet now!
It's time to go to bed!
Ow!
Scootaloo says: "What is that?"
Fluttershy says: "Girls!"
Apple Bloom says: "Fluttershy, your chickens are on the loose!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I wonder what could have caused that..."
Scootaloo says: "Don't worry, Fluttershy, the Cutie Mark Crusaders will handle this!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Cutie Mark Crusader chicken herders!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Yay!"
Fluttershy says: "No, I don't think that's a—"
Fluttershy says: "ah, come back!"
Fluttershy says: "Please!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders giggling, more chicken flapping and squawking.
Fluttershy says: "Come on, girls, the chickens are fine—"
Fluttershy says: "oh, girls, um..."
Fluttershy says: "girls!"
Fluttershy says: "Come on, in you go."
Fluttershy says: "There's some good chickens."
Fluttershy says: "Okay, you three."
Fluttershy says: "Isn't it about time you got into bed?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "But—"
Fluttershy says: "Please?"
Fluttershy says: "So, no more crusading for tonight, all right?"
Scootaloo says: "Yes, Fluttershy!"
Sweetie Belle says: "We promise, Fluttershy!"
Apple Bloom says: "Good night, Fluttershy!"
Fluttershy says: "Okay, good night."
Sweetie Belle says: "Okay, so what kind of crusading do we do next?"
Apple Bloom says: "There's not much we can do from this room..."
Apple Bloom says: "unless we become Cutie Mark Crusader cottage cleaners."
Sweetie Belle says: "N-no, thanks."
Apple Bloom says: "Well, we have to think of somethin'."
Apple Bloom says: "We can't just waste this opportunity to find out what our special talents are."
Apple Bloom says: "Hey, girls!"
Apple Bloom says: "Look!"
Apple Bloom says: "Some of the chickens may have escaped!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Into the forest!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Cutie Mark Crusaders chicken rescuers are go!"
Fluttershy says: "It really wasn't that hard..."
Fluttershy says: "I mean, all I needed to do was just show them who's in charge."
Fluttershy says: "Nothing's gonna get past Fluttershy!"
Fluttershy says: "Good with animals, good with kids."
Scootaloo says: "Wait up!"
Fluttershy says: "Mmm, peace and quiet."
Fluttershy says: "The Everfree Forest!"
Fluttershy says: "Those girls have really done it this time!"
Fluttershy says: "They've really bitten off more than they can chew!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, just like me!"
Fluttershy says: "I never should have offered to watch them."
Apple Bloom says: "Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!"
Apple Bloom says: "Brawck, bawk-bawk-bawk, brawck!"
Scootaloo says: "What are you doing?"
Apple Bloom says: "Callin' for the chicken!"
Scootaloo says: "That is not how you call a chicken."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, and you know how to call a chicken?"
Scootaloo says: "I know that's not the way."
Apple Bloom says: "Then show me."
Scootaloo says: "I don't have to show you!"
Apple Bloom says: "You're just chicken!"
Scootaloo says: "Am not!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, wait, now I know how to call a chicken!"
Apple Bloom says: "Scootaloo!"
Apple Bloom says: "Scoot-scootalooooo!"
Scootaloo says: "That's so funny I forgot to laugh."
Apple Bloom says: "You also forgot how to call a chicken!"
Scootaloo says: "Why, you..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Come on, guys, we're not gonna find the chicken or our cutie marks by arguing."
Apple Bloom says: "Maybe that's our special talent."
Apple Bloom says: "Arguin'!"
Scootaloo says: "Is not!"
Apple Bloom says: "Is too!"
Scootaloo says: "Is not!"
Apple Bloom says: "Is too!"
Apple Bloom says: "Anything yet?"
Scootaloo says: "Nope."
Apple Bloom says: "Darn."
Apple Bloom says: "Heeeere, chick-chick-chick-chick, baaawk, bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk, b-baaaaawk!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh!"
Fluttershy says: "Get a hold of yourself, Fluttershy."
Fluttershy says: "Just put one hoof in front of the other."
Fluttershy says: "Ahh!"
Fluttershy says: "What was that?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, no!"
Fluttershy says: "If you've been turned to stone, it must mean—"
Fluttershy says: "oh!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh no, the girls!"
Fluttershy says: "Don't move."
Fluttershy says: "I'll be back for you."
Fluttershy says: "Girls!"
Scootaloo says: "Is not!"
Apple Bloom says: "Is too!"
Scootaloo says: "Is not!"
Apple Bloom says: "Is too!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Girls!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Our special talent is not arguing."
Sweetie Belle says: "Besides, what would the cutie mark of somepony whose talent is arguing even look like?"
Fluttershy says: "Girls?"
Fluttershy says: "Girls?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Fluttershy?"
Fluttershy says: "Girls!"
Fluttershy says: "Thank goodness I found you!"
Apple Bloom says: "Fluttershy, what—"
Fluttershy says: "Girls, we have to leave the forest at once!"
Sweetie Belle says: "But..."
Sweetie Belle says: "we haven't found the chicken yet!"
Fluttershy says: "There's no time for that."
Fluttershy says: "There's a cockatrice on the loose!"
Apple Bloom says: "A cocka-what now?"
Fluttershy says: "A cockatrice!"
Fluttershy says: "It's a frightening creature with the head of a chicken and the body of a snake."
Fluttershy says: "Now, come on!"
Scootaloo says: "The head of a chicken and the body of a snake?"
Scootaloo says: "That doesn't sound scary, that sounds silly!"
Apple Bloom says: "Why, if I ever saw one of them cockathingies face-to-face, I'd laugh at how silly it was."
Fluttershy says: "No!"
Fluttershy says: "Never look one in the eye!"
Fluttershy says: "If you look a cockatrice in the eye—"
Apple Bloom says: "The chicken!"
Fluttershy says: "Girls!"
Fluttershy says: "Wait!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!"
Sweetie Belle says: "There he is!"
Scootaloo says: "Two chickens?"
Apple Bloom says: "I thought only one escaped!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Grab them both!"
Fluttershy says: "See?"
Fluttershy says: "Now we have to—"
Fluttershy says: "Girls, please."
Fluttershy says: "Girls—"
Fluttershy says: "now listen to me, girls, I—"
Fluttershy says: "please!"
Fluttershy says: "Girls!"
Fluttershy says: "Behind me, now!"
Fluttershy says: "You!"
Fluttershy says: "Just who do you think you are, going around turning others into stone?"
Fluttershy says: "You should be ashamed of yourself."
Fluttershy says: "I have a mind to find your mother and tell her what you've been up to, young man."
Fluttershy says: "Now you go over there, and turn Elizabeak and my friend Twilight back to normal, and don't ever let me catch you doing this again."
Fluttershy says: "Do you understand me?"
Fluttershy says: "Are you girls all right?"
Fluttershy says: "I was so worried!"
Scootaloo says: "Yeah, fine!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Thanks to that stare of yours."
Scootaloo says: "You're like the queen of stares."
Scootaloo says: "You're the—"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Stare Master!"
Sweetie Belle says: "We're sorry we snuck out of the house and into the forest."
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah."
Apple Bloom says: "We'll listen to you from now on."
Scootaloo says: "We promise."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, you do, do you?"
Fluttershy says: "Well, you better, or I'll give you..."
Fluttershy says: "the Stare!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "what happened?"
Fluttershy says: "And that's when it brought you back from stone."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is gonna make quite a letter to the princess."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I was wrong about you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You certainly do know how to handle those girls."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, I wouldn't go that far."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hmm?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "How so?"
Fluttershy says: "I assumed that I'd be just as good with kids as I am with animals."
Fluttershy says: "Boy, was I wrong."
Fluttershy says: "I really learned the hard way not to bite off more than I could chew."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You and Rarity both."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Good morning, Rarity."
Fluttershy says: "Did you finish all those capes?"
Rarity says: "Just delivered them."
Rarity says: "I have to admit, if you hadn't come along, I might not have."
Rarity says: "Thanks again."
Fluttershy says: "Won't you stay for some tea?"
Rarity says: "I really must get back to the shop and clean up."
Rarity says: "Girls!"
Rarity says: "Get your things."
Rarity says: "Time to go."
Rarity says: "Girls!"
Rarity says: "Girls!"
Rarity says: "Time to—"
Rarity says: "Girls!"
Rarity says: "Your things!"
Rarity says: "Girls!"
Rarity says: "It's time to—"
Rarity says: "Girls!"
Fluttershy says: "Allow me."
Fluttershy says: "Girls?"
Apple Bloom says: "Yes, Fluttershy."
Scootaloo says: "You called?"
Fluttershy says: "Go and get your things."
Fluttershy says: "Rarity is here to see you home."
Sweetie Belle says: "Of course, Fluttershy, right away!"
Rarity says: "Ah, huh, ah, how did you..."
Rarity says: "how did you do that?"
Fluttershy says: "I guess I'm just as good with kids as I am with animals."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Thank you, Fluttershy!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Bye!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Thank you, Stare Master!"
Rarity says: "Ah, uh, speaking of which, I could use your help with Opal."
Fluttershy says: "Of course."
Fluttershy says: "How about later today?"
Rarity says: "How about now?"
