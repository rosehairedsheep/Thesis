Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, wow!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, my gosh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Sorry, Applejack!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Twilight!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Twilight!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Where are you?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm in here, Pinkie!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What is it?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You'll never guess what I just got!"
Applejack says: "Is everythin' okay?"
Applejack says: "We heard a lot of "oh-my-gosh"-in', and we weren't sure if it was a good thing or a bad thing."
Pinkie Pie says: "A good thing!"
Twilight Sparkle says: ""Yaks cordially invite pink pony to Yickslurbertfest."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Come."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now."
Pinkie Pie says: "Prince Rutherford is officially inviting me to Yickslurbertfest in Yakyakistan!"
Rarity says: "What is Yickslurbertfest?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's a sacred yak holiday."
Twilight Sparkle says: "How did you get Prince Rutherford to invite you?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I subtly hinted for an invitation in my letters to him."
Pinkie Pie says: "May I please come to Yickslurbertfest?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pretty please?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pretty please?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pretty please?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty please?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "After my seventeenth scroll, I think he picked up what I was putting down."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You know, we still don't know a lot about the yaks."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So I think you should definitely go to Yickslurbertfest, Pinkie."
Fluttershy says: "Fostering friendships is what ponies do."
Pinkie Pie says: "I won't let you down!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's an honor to be the official friendship ambassador to the yaks!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Um, that's not an official position."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yet."
Pinkie Pie says: "You're the princess of friendship."
Pinkie Pie says: "You can make it happen."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, you got it."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ahem?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You have to make it official!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Right."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I hereby make Pinkie Pie the official friendship ambassador to the yaks!"
Pinkie Pie says: "This is officially the most exciting day of my life!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yoo-hoo!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Gummy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pay attention!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We're in the middle of an official friendship ambassador road trip game!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's better."
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "I spy with my official friendship eye something that is blue!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We're here!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, and by the way, the answer was sky."
Pinkie Pie says: "I win!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah, I know."
Pinkie Pie says: "That was a hard one, Gummy."
Pinkie Pie says: "You're the best official friendship travel companion ever!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What is going on?"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks destroy!"
Yaks says: "Yaks destroy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yikes!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Pink pony!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's an honor to  be here, prince."
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, did something terrible happen?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is Yickslurbertfest cancelled?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Prince Rutherford says: "No!"
Prince Rutherford says: "This Yickslurbertfest, where yaks come together to stomp."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ohhhhh."
Pinkie Pie says: "I didn't know that was part of the sacred holiday."
Pinkie Pie says: "So this angry display of destruction is part of the festivies."
Pinkie Pie says: "Huh."
Pinkie Pie says: "And here I thought you yaks were just in a bad mood."
Prince Rutherford says: "No."
Prince Rutherford says: "Stomping relaxes yaks."
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks' head never been so clear."
Pinkie Pie says: "This is awesome!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Stop!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Pink pony better check self before wreck self."
Prince Rutherford says: "That is century-old sacred yak twig, passed down from generation to generation."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maybe I can fix it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Phew!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, you sure did, Prince Rutherford."
Pinkie Pie says: "That was a close one, Gummy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "This trip has to be perfect!"
Pinkie Pie says: "After all, we're not just visiting as friends."
Pinkie Pie says: "We're on official friendship ambassador business!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Less talking, more stomping!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Stompie-stompie-stompie-stompie!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Now, I take pink pony on Yakyakistan tour."
Pinkie Pie says: "Thanks, Prince Rutherford, but, heh, I've been to Yakyakistan before."
Prince Rutherford says: "Yak know."
Prince Rutherford says: "But thought pink pony might not recognize town since decorated for Yickslurbertfest."
Pinkie Pie says: "You're right!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's so different, now that you've pointed it out."
Prince Rutherford says: "Oh, yaks not just have eye for decorating."
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks also amazing builders!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No way!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I thought you hired professional contractors!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Here."
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, let me help you with that."
Prince Rutherford says: "This ceremonial yak fire pit, where yaks tell stories."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I have so much to officially tell the ponies when I get back."
Prince Rutherford says: "This yak eating hut."
Prince Rutherford says: "Hut where yaks eat."
Pinkie Pie says: "Mmmm!"
Pinkie Pie says: "The perfect balance of vanilla extract."
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks grow own vanilla bean."
Prince Rutherford says: "Nothing imported."
Prince Rutherford says: "Yak sleeping hut."
Prince Rutherford says: "Hut where yaks sleep."
Pinkie Pie says: "Huh!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yak music hut."
Prince Rutherford says: "Hut where yaks enjoy beautiful music."
Pinkie Pie says: "This is beautiful and—"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Shhh!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Pink pony ruin with talking!"
Prince Rutherford says: "..."
Prince Rutherford says: "And that how yaks defeat evil and save world!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pink pony like yak story!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Ho-ho!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yak impressed!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Pink pony can almost be honorary yak."
Pinkie Pie says: "Prince Rutherford, can I get some honorary yak horns?"
Prince Rutherford says: "No."
Prince Rutherford says: "Yak horn too heavy for small pony head."
Prince Rutherford says: "Yickslurbertfest stomp time!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Stomp harder!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks extra happy!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Ponies and yaks friends!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is this part of the festival?"
Prince Rutherford says: "Pink pony ask too many questions."
Pinkie Pie says: "Everything is buried in snow!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What are we gonna do?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Uhhh..."
Prince Rutherford says: "Y-Yaks fine!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Snow falls from mountain all the time!"
Pinkie Pie says: "All the time?"
Prince Rutherford says: "Every Yickslurbertfest."
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "Avalanches like this completely bury all your homes every Yickslurbertfest?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Really?"
Prince Rutherford says: "This is..."
Prince Rutherford says: "big avalanche."
Prince Rutherford says: "But not a problem, for yaks are tough!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks dig through snow!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Won't take long."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, good."
Pinkie Pie says: "You have an emergency plan in place."
Pinkie Pie says: "Here, let me help!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whew."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm tired."
Pinkie Pie says: "We must be almost done."
Pinkie Pie says: "There's still snow everywhere?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks keep digging!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks stop digging!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Make situation worse!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't worry, Prince Rutherford."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'll go back to Ponyville and ask for help."
Pinkie Pie says: "Twilight and the others will be happy to come dig the snow away."
Pinkie Pie says: "After all, "many hooves make light work."
Pinkie Pie says: "" Right, Gummy?"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks no need pony help!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, I'm sure it'll be okay, 'cause you probably have a Plan B."
Prince Rutherford says: "Yes."
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks wait for snow to melt."
Pinkie Pie says: "All this snow?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It'll take a thousand moons before it melts!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks known for their patience."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well..."
Pinkie Pie says: "be that as it may, in the meantime, what will you eat?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Where will you sleep?"
Prince Rutherford says: "Dah!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks can make this work!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Hardship make yaks the strong yaks that yaks are!"
Prince Rutherford says: "If pink pony disagrees, then she can leave Yakyakistan and never return!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Mmmm!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yaks can make this work!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yak tired."
Prince Rutherford says: "Yak retire to new sleeping hut."
Prince Rutherford says: "Snow cake good!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Mmmm!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Just the right balance of cold and water!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Aah!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Stop!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yak eating new eating hut!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Psst!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Prince Rutherford."
Pinkie Pie says: "What are we doing?"
Prince Rutherford says: "It's obvious."
Prince Rutherford says: "This new music hut."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh."
Pinkie Pie says: "So we're swaying to—"
Prince Rutherford says: "Shhh!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Pink pony ruin snow music with talking!"
Yak Kid 1 says: "What was yak?"
Yak Kid 2 says: "Yak stomach rumbles."
Yak Kid 2 says: "Yak hungry."
Yak Kid 1 says: "Shhh!"
Yak Kid 1 says: "Prince yak will hear yak!"
Yak Kid 2 says: "But snow worse than yak ever seen!"
Yak Kid 1 says: "Yak know."
Yak Kid 1 says: "Yak hungry, too."
Pinkie Pie says: "Gummy, did you hear that?"
Pinkie Pie says: "They can't make it work!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks stop swaying!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Music over!"
Pinkie Pie says: "If Twilight and the others knew what was going on, they would be here to help in a pony's heartbeat."
Pinkie Pie says: "We have to convince Prince Rutherford that asking for help is okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "Will you help me, Gummy?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Thank you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And see?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Asking you to help wasn't hard at all."
Pinkie Pie says: "Pink pony has gathered you around the new ceremonial yak fire pit to tell you a story!"
Pinkie Pie says: "A yak tradition, right?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yay!"
Pinkie Pie says: "This is a story about a group of..."
Pinkie Pie says: "uh, goats!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Who lived in the desert."
Pinkie Pie says: "There was a sandstorm, and their entire village was buried in sand."
Pinkie Pie says: "There was nothing they could do."
Pinkie Pie says: "They knew they could not survive by only eating sand..."
Pinkie Pie says: "wiches!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Get it?"
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "Anyway..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Cows!"
Pinkie Pie says: "The magical cows helped the goats, everyone survived, and lived happily ever after!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Because they asked for help."
Pinkie Pie says: "The end!"
Pinkie Pie says: "So what is the moral of that story?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it – A – asking for help is okay?"
Pinkie Pie says: "B – asking for help saves the day?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Or – C – asking for help is good for everypony?"
Prince Rutherford says: "D – goats weak and horrible!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Magic bovines need to stay out of goats' business!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Um..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Not quite."
Pinkie Pie says: "Any yak wanna shout out another answer?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, Prince Rutherford."
Pinkie Pie says: "I wanna talk to you about something."
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, what are you doing?"
Prince Rutherford says: "Uh, yak's snow bed got a little melty last night."
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay, yeah."
Pinkie Pie says: "That's what I wanna talk to you about."
Pinkie Pie says: "You know, these yak snow beds are the fluffiest I've ever slept in."
Pinkie Pie says: "They're so comfortable, you forget that it's just a cold block of ice."
Pinkie Pie says: "And the yak snow sandwiches?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Mm-mmm!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I hate it when food burns your mouth or overwhelms it with flavor!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Ah!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yak hates that, too!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You know who would really, really enjoy these snow sandwiches?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Twilight Sparkle and the other ponies!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, hey!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I have an idea!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Why don't I go to Ponyville and bring them back here?"
Prince Rutherford says: "Ponies like snow sandwich?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ponies love snow sandwiches!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And hey, while they're here, you can ask if they'll clear the snow away."
Pinkie Pie says: "Fun, right?"
Prince Rutherford says: "When prince was little yak, prince stomped on ground too hard."
Prince Rutherford says: "Made deep hole and fell into hole."
Prince Rutherford says: "Ice froze over hole."
Prince Rutherford says: "Prince waved to friends and family from inside frozen hole."
Prince Rutherford says: "Waited for spring thaw."
Prince Rutherford says: "Prince survived on own."
Pinkie Pie says: "W-W-Wait a minute."
Pinkie Pie says: "You spent the whole winter in a hole?"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yes."
Prince Rutherford says: "And yak never asked for help!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "First of all, how did you make such a deep hole from stomping?"
Pinkie Pie says: "And how did it freeze over so fast?"
Pinkie Pie says: "And how could you see your family and friends to wave to them from inside a frozen hole?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Even if all that was possible, how did you breathe in there?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks don't ask for help!"
Pinkie Pie says: "But the yaks are hungry!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And who knows when the snow will melt?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I just don't understand why—"
Prince Rutherford says: "Ah, yes."
Prince Rutherford says: "Is clear now that pink pony does not understand yaks."
Prince Rutherford says: "Honorary yak status rescinded!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Bang!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Pretend there is door!"
Prince Rutherford says: "I just slammed it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Fine!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Be stubborn!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Those yaks are so stubborn!"
Pinkie Pie says: "They refuse to ask for help, even though they need it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, this official friendship ambassador is gonna take matters into her own hooves!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'll show them!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You're right, Gummy."
Pinkie Pie says: "I am too worked up."
Pinkie Pie says: "Road trip game would officially calm me down."
Pinkie Pie says: "I know!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Let's play Twenty Million Questions!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You think of something, then I'll ask you twenty million questions until I can come up with what you're thinking of!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Let's go!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it blue?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it green?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it red?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it greenish-red?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it reddish-blue?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it bigger than a bread box?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it smaller than a bread box?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it a bread box?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it bread?"
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it teeth?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it Granny Smith's dentures?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it you?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it a rooster?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it a red rooster?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it a red rooster eating corn?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Used up all twenty million questions!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, well."
Pinkie Pie says: "We're here anyway."
Prince Rutherford says: "Official pony balloon still here?"
Prince Rutherford says: "Pink pony gone because pink pony not tough like yaks!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Horn bump in agreement!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Now!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Pleh!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Snow sandwich lose novelty!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Snow couscous for dinner!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Then Prince Rutherford said,  "Bang!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pretend there is door!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I just slammed it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie Pie—"
Pinkie Pie says: "So then pink pony said,  "Fine!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Be stubborn!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie Pie, we have to help the yaks."
Pinkie Pie says: "So in conclusion, we have to help the yaks!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hmm?"
Applejack says: "Just go with it, hon."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Great idea, Pinkie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We'll be happy to help the yaks."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is what friendship is all about."
Applejack says: "Hey!"
Applejack says: "I'll bring apples."
Applejack says: "This season's batch are extra juicy."
Rarity says: "And I shall provide the yaks with Equestria's finest textiles."
Rarity says: "They'll be silky and warm with hints of gold to complement their horns—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Stop!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We can't bring the yaks any pony stuff!"
Fluttershy says: "Why not?"
Pinkie Pie says: "The yaks are very proud."
Pinkie Pie says: "They won't ask for help."
Pinkie Pie says: "You know what they say – "you can lead a yak to water, but you better not let him know you're doing it."
Rainbow Dash says: "Nopony says that."
Rainbow Dash says: "Do they?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay then."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This'll be an official covert friendship mission."
Applejack says: "Mm-hmm!"
Fluttershy says: "Mm-hmm!"
Rarity says: "Mm-hmm!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You got it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it yellow?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it slimy?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it slimy yellow?"
Rainbow Dash says: "We're not playing that!"
Pinkie Pie says: "First, we have to infiltrate the yak compound."
Pinkie Pie says: "These walls are high."
Pinkie Pie says: "Sneaking in will not be easy."
Rainbow Dash says: "Or it's super-easy 'cause I'm awesome."
Pinkie Pie says: "Go ahead!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'll catch up!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You all know what to do!"
Prince Rutherford says: "What happened?!"
Prince Rutherford says: "!"
Yak says: "Snow melted!"
Yak says: "Prince Rutherford was right!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks tough!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks wait patiently!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Yaks win!"
Applejack says: "Hoo-wee!"
Applejack says: "Helpin' to fix an entire yak village sure takes a lot outta ya."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's get out of here before—"
Prince Rutherford says: "Oh, pink pony!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No, no!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We're just here for the snow sandwiches!"
Pinkie Pie says: "But then we got here, and the snow was gone, so we thought we'd hit a diner on our way back to Ponyville!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Bye-bye!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Wait."
Prince Rutherford says: "Yak not mad at pink pony."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yak not?"
Prince Rutherford says: "Pink pony help yaks without yaks asking."
Prince Rutherford says: "Means pink pony understand yaks."
Pinkie Pie says: "I do?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Huh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I do!"
Prince Rutherford says: "Pink pony the best kind of friend."
Prince Rutherford says: "Officially honorary yak!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yippee!"
Pinkie Pie says: "My own honorary yak horns!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Now I can officially horn-bump!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoa!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah..."
Pinkie Pie says: "You know, this is a little heavy for my small pony head."
Applejack says: "Need some help with that, Pinkie Pie?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Just kidding!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pink pony got apple pony good!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Seriously, this is heavy."
