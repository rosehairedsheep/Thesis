Rarity says: "Oh, Spiiiike?"
Rarity says: "Are you in here?"
Rarity says: "Hellooooo?"
Rarity says: "Spike?"
Spike says: "Mm-hmm..."
Rarity says: "Oh, there you are!"
Rarity says: "I was starting to think you weren't here."
Rarity says: "I realize this is last-minute, but I've decided on a quick trip to the gem cave!"
Rarity says: "I am on an urgent mission to find some faceted iridescence for my new design, and I can't think of anypony I'd rather have along than my favorite basket holder/bodyguard Spike."
Rarity says: "Spike?"
Rarity says: "Spiiiike?"
Rarity says: "SPIKE!"
Spike says: "What?"
Spike says: "Oh."
Spike says: "Hey, Rarity."
Rarity says: "Honestly, Spike."
Rarity says: "It's almost as if you haven't been listening."
Spike says: "Oh, uh..."
Spike says: "of course I was."
Spike says: "But just to be sure, could you say it all again?"
Rarity says: "I was saying that I had planned on visiting the gem cave—"
Spike says: "Oh, no!"
Spike says: "Is that the time?!"
Spike says: "!"
Rarity says: "Aah!"
Rarity says: "Of course, you're right."
Rarity says: "This is a bit of a late start, and those gems won't pick themselves."
Spike says: "Uh-huh."
Rarity says: "But the real question is which basket do you want to hold?"
Rarity says: "The smaller one, right?"
Spike says: "Oh, right."
Spike says: "Sorry, Rarity."
Spike says: "Can I take a rain check on..."
Spike says: "What was that again?"
Rarity says: "The..."
Rarity says: "gem cave?"
Spike says: "Right."
Spike says: "Sounds great."
Spike says: "But I need to get to the post office before noon."
Rarity says: "All right, very funny."
Rarity says: "Obviously, you'll get the bigger basket, and I shall—"
Rarity says: "Spike?"
Rarity says: "Hello?"
Rarity says: "I don't understand."
Rarity says: "For as long as we've known each other, Spike has never turned down an opportunity to join me here."
Rarity says: "It's his favorite place."
Rarity says: "Ideally you catch the gems, dear."
Rarity says: "And for a trip to the post office of all places?"
Rarity says: "Maybe you should move closer?"
Rarity says: "And why would Spike need to go to the post office at all?"
Rarity says: "He sends mail by breathing!"
Rarity says: "Breathing, darling!"
Rarity says: "Breath mail!"
Rarity says: "Honestly, Applejack, if you're going to fill in, you could make an attempt to hold the basket the way Spike would."
Applejack says: "And how's that?"
Rarity says: "Well, for one thing, Spike knows how to keep things quiet so as not to waken the bats."
Rarity says: "And he usually pulls me closely so no gem ever touches the ground!"
Applejack says: "I AIN'T SPIKE!"
Rarity says: "Actually, Applejack, I had noticed!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Um, hi, Rarity."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's up?"
Rarity says: "Ugh!"
Rarity says: "Besides my mane?"
Rarity says: "Well, that is a question for Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, Spike isn't here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I think he's at the post office."
Rarity says: "Again?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "What is it with Spike and the post office?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rarity, what's going on?"
Rarity says: "Spike declined my invitation to the gem cave, and I intend to find out why."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hmm."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That doesn't sound like Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Did you two have some sort of fight?"
Rarity says: "A fight?"
Rarity says: "Goodness, Twilight."
Rarity says: "What in Equestria would we fight about?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've had arguments with friends before, and they can put a real strain on friendships."
Rarity says: "Well, certainly."
Rarity says: "But I think I'd remember if we had an argument."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Maybe you didn't realize it?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Do you think you could've done something that unintentionally hurt his feelings?"
Rarity says: "Well, if I didn't realize what I did, how would I know what I have done when I did it?"
Rarity says: "I wonder if that's it."
Rarity says: "It certainly would explain his behavior."
Rarity says: "I must apologize!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "For what?"
Rarity says: "Oh, pfft."
Rarity says: "That's hardly the point."
Rarity says: "Poor Spikey-Wikey!"
Rarity says: "This calls for a grand gesture!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Good talk."
Gabby says: "Wow!"
Gabby says: "That's a big crate of stuff you're mailing."
Rarity says: "I'm not mailing it."
Gabby says: "Then why are you pushing it into the post office?"
Rarity says: "Oh."
Rarity says: "I didn't realize griffons worked at the Ponyville Post Office."
Gabby says: "Oh!"
Gabby says: "No, I don't work here exactly."
Gabby says: "I'm the official mail carrier of Griffonstone."
Gabby says: "Gabby Griffon."
Gabby says: "Nice to meet ya!"
Rarity says: "Yes, well, uh, these things aren't for sending."
Rarity says: "They're for apologizing to Spike."
Gabby says: "Oh!"
Gabby says: "Spike was just here."
Gabby says: "He went to go make us a—"
Rarity says: "That's perfect!"
Rarity says: "It'll give me a chance to practice."
Rarity says: "Uh, you stand there and tell me if I hit the right apologetic notes."
Gabby says: "What are you apologizing for?"
Rarity says: "Darling, I don't see why that matters."
Rarity says: "And scene."
Rarity says: "Oh, sorry, dear."
Rarity says: "Here."
Gabby says: "I said, that sure sounds genuine."
Rarity says: "Well, of course it sounds genuine!"
Rarity says: "It is genuine!"
Spike says: "Rarity?"
Spike says: "What are you doing?"
Rarity says: "Obviously, I'm working on my apology to you, Spike."
Rarity says: "I don't know how I could be more genuine."
Rarity says: "I mean—"
Rarity says: "Spike!"
Rarity says: "Oh, Spike!"
Rarity says: "I am so sorry!"
Rarity says: "Please forgive me!"
Rarity says: "Pleeeeeeeease!"
Spike says: "Of course I forgive you."
Spike says: "But, uh, what are you apologizing for?"
Rarity says: "Why does everypony keep harping on that—"
Rarity says: "?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "Wait."
Rarity says: "Don't you know?"
Spike says: "No, I'm not mad at you about anything."
Rarity says: "B-But..."
Rarity says: "But I don't understand."
Rarity says: "If you're not upset with me, why in Equestria would you refuse to go to the gem cave?"
Spike says: "Uh, because I had other plans?"
Gabby says: "With me!"
Rarity says: "I don't understand."
Rarity says: "You two know each other?"
Spike says: "Gabby and I are sort of pen pals."
Gabby says: "Yeah!"
Gabby says: "There was this whole thing where I pretended to get a cutie mark because griffons don't get cutie marks, so Princess Twilight had Spike send a bunch of letters off to Griffonstone about the first griffon ever to get a cutie mark!"
Gabby says: "Which I didn't really have."
Spike says: "Gabby wrote back explaining things, and after that we just started writing back and forth."
Gabby says: "Turns out we have a lot in common!"
Gabby says: "We both come from cultures that don't have the friendliest of reputations."
Spike says: "And we're both in the message-sending business!"
Gabby says: "Uh-huh!"
Gabby says: "I sure wish I could send scrolls with my breath!"
Rarity says: "Yes..."
Rarity says: "Now I understand why you didn't come to the gem cave."
Rarity says: "Having a friend in town is a rare treat."
Rarity says: "Well, since you're busy today, maybe we can do something tomorrow."
Rarity says: "Fabric shopping?"
Rarity says: "I know how you love to pick out the colors."
Spike says: "Uh, actually, now that there's a griffon at Twilight's school, Gabby's here all the time."
Gabby says: "Grampa Gruff asks for a lot of updates about how Gallus is doing."
Gabby says: "Speaking of which, I better get going."
Spike says: "I'll fly with you."
Rarity says: "Well, all right."
Rarity says: "You two fly along."
Rarity says: "I'm sure Spike and I can do something some other—"
Rarity says: "..."
Rarity says: "time?"
Rarity says: "I cannot decide which shade of purple is the most royal!"
Rarity says: "And there's the pink!"
Rarity says: "How will I ever choose?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Too bad Spike's not here."
Rainbow Dash says: "I bet he could help you narrow it down."
Rarity says: "He is a good sounding board, isn't he?"
Rarity says: "Could you bring the pincushion a little closer, dear?"
Rarity says: "I suppose now that Spike's always so busy with Gabby, I'm just now realizing how much his presence has meant to me over the years."
Rarity says: "Even closer, darling."
Rarity says: "I don't want to prick you."
Rarity says: "I have to admit everything feels a bit "less than" without him."
Rarity says: "Too close!"
Rarity says: "Oh, darling, it's no use."
Rarity says: "Thank you for trying."
Rarity says: "I'm just accustomed to the help of a small, highly attentive dragon."
Fluttershy says: "Maybe you should let Spike know how grateful you are for everything he's done for you."
Spike says: "Aah!"
Rarity says: "Oh, I am sorry, Spike."
Rarity says: "I didn't mean to frighten you."
Spike says: "Rarity?"
Spike says: "What are you doing here?"
Rarity says: "Well, I realize it's late."
Rarity says: "Or rather, early."
Rarity says: "But I have a surprise, and I just couldn't wait to share it."
Rarity says: "The Great Gem Crevasse of the Crystal Mountains!"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Rarity says: "It is only accessible once a year, and I thought a little day trip would make a wonderful thank you for all the help you've given me over the years."
Spike says: "Oh."
Spike says: "But I'm supposed to meet Gabby today for her rounds."
Rarity says: "I see."
Rarity says: "Well, there's always next year."
Spike says: "You know what?"
Spike says: "I'll just write her a note."
Rarity says: "Are you sure?"
Spike says: "Absolutely."
Spike says: "Wow."
Spike says: "Rarity, you weren't kidding."
Spike says: "The Gem Crevasse was amazing!"
Spike says: "I'll be snacking on these for a week."
Rarity says: "What did I tell you?"
Gabby says: "Hey, Spike!"
Spike says: "Gabby!"
Spike says: "You won't believe where I went today!"
Gabby says: "Actually, I think I will."
Gabby says: "I got your scroll."
Gabby says: "The Great Gem Crevasse sounds a lot better than doing my rounds."
Spike says: "Mm-hmm!"
Gabby says: "Whoa!"
Gabby says: "It was definitely better!"
Gabby says: "I gotta get back to Griffonstone, but you have to tell me all about the Crevasse tomorrow!"
Spike says: "Absolutely!"
Spike says: "Thanks again, Rarity."
Spike says: "What a great day."
Gabby says: "Okay!"
Gabby says: "Start from the beginning, because I want to hear everything!"
Spike says: "Well, to get to the Crevasse, you have to climb across a rope bridge because the air's too thin to fly!"
Gabby says: "That is amazing!"
Gabby says: "Then what?!"
Gabby says: "!"
Gabby says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "Sorry, Rarity!"
Rarity says: "Oh, no apology necessary, Spike."
Rarity says: "In fact, I was just looking for you."
Spike says: "You were?"
Spike says: "Why?"
Rarity says: "Because I just acquired..."
Rarity says: "these!"
Spike says: "Passes to Power Ponypalooza!"
Spike says: "?"
Spike says: "For today!"
Spike says: "?"
Rarity says: "Mm-hmm!"
Rarity says: "I know we just went to the Crevasse, but I feel I've barely scratched the surface of expressing my gratitude for all you do."
Spike says: "Uh..."
Spike says: "of course I want to go, but that'll be two days in a row we haven't hung out."
Gabby says: "Nah!"
Gabby says: "Are you kidding?"
Gabby says: "It's Power Ponypalooza!"
Gabby says: "You have to go!"
Gabby says: "And now you'll have two things to tell me about!"
Spike says: "Okay!"
Spike says: "Come on, Rarity!"
Spike says: "Let's go!"
Spike says: "Whew!"
Spike says: "Are my claws sore."
Rarity says: "Indeed."
Rarity says: "I had no idea how much walking there is at a Power Pony convention!"
Spike says: "Aww."
Spike says: "I know I told Gabby we'd hang out tomorrow, but I might need the whole day to rest."
Rarity says: "Whoo."
Rarity says: "I know what you mean."
Rarity says: "Perhaps you could, uh, just send her another note."
Spike says: "I think maybe you're right."
Rarity says: "Honestly, I might need to spend tomorrow putting my hooves up as well."
Rarity says: "I hadn't counted on Power Ponypalooza being quite so draining, but I thought we might spend the day recuperating together."
Spike says: "No way!"
Spike says: "Ogres & Oubliettes?!"
Spike says: "!"
Rarity says: "Well, I know how much you enjoy it."
Rarity says: "And this seemed like the perfect opportunity for you to teach me the game."
Gabby says: "Spike?"
Gabby says: "I got your note!"
Gabby says: "I figured I'd come by before my rounds with a bowl of energizing turnip soup."
Rarity says: "Can Princess Shmarity use her Shield of the Coiffure to defend herself from the purveyor of poor color coordination?"
Spike says: "Oh, she can try..."
Spike says: "Success!"
Spike says: "Shmarity's shield holds against the Green-Eyed Monster's attack!"
Spike says: "And then—"
Spike says: "!"
Gabby says: "Spike?"
Spike says: "Oh, hi, Gabby."
Spike says: "We were just—"
Gabby says: "Your scroll said you were too tired to do anything today."
Gabby says: "But I guess you were just too tired to do anything with me."
Spike says: "No-no-no-no!"
Spike says: "That's not true!"
Spike says: "I can come with you on your rounds right now!"
Gabby says: "I don't think so, Spike."
Gabby says: "Maybe I'll just handle the rounds on my own from now on."
Rarity says: "Oooh!"
Rarity says: "Princess Shmarity uses her Prismatic Beam to change that poor monster's color to a more pleasing shade of purple!"
Rarity says: "What do you think, Spike?"
Rarity says: "Solids or prints?"
Spike says: "Prints, I guess."
Spike says: "You already have a lot of solid colors."
Rarity says: "Oh, you are so right."
Rarity says: "Prints it is!"
Rarity says: "So nice to have you back, Spike."
Rarity says: "Although I hope you're able to reconcile with Gabby."
Spike says: "I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to."
Rarity says: "I quite enjoyed our day together today, Spike."
Spike says: "Yeah..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hi, Spike."
Spike says: "Uh-huh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hmmm."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've never seen Spike this sad before."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Do you know what happened?"
Rarity says: "Yes, well, perhaps he's still just tired from Power Ponypalooza."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't think that's it."
Rarity says: "I..."
Rarity says: "suppose..."
Rarity says: "it's possible it could have something to do with..."
Rarity says: "Gabby not wanting to spend time with him anymore."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I thought the two of them were hanging out all the time."
Rarity says: "They were!"
Rarity says: "Honestly, it took everything I had to convince him to spend any time with me at all!"
Rarity says: "But between crystal gem crevasses, Power Pony conventions, and a marathon game of O&O, I managed to get some time in."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It sounds like you made sure he didn't have any time to spend with Gabby at all."
Rarity says: "What?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "Pfft!"
Rarity says: "I most certainly did not!"
Rarity says: "Well, I..."
Rarity says: "suppose I may have monopolized him a teeny bit."
Rarity says: "I'd just grown so used to having Spikey-Wikey around, I wasn't prepared for how much I'd miss him when he wasn't."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Friendships change, but just because Spike made a new friend doesn't mean he stops being yours."
Rarity says: "I know, but now I have to share him!"
Rarity says: "Which I suppose I'll have to get used to."
Rarity says: "Right after I fix the mess I've made!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Good talk."
Gabby says: "Rarity?"
Gabby says: "Is all this stuff for Spike again?"
Gabby says: "Wouldn't it be easier to just give it to him?"
Gabby says: "And why are you even here?"
Rarity says: "I am here to apologize."
Rarity says: "Actually, more to confess."
Rarity says: "And all of this stuff isn't for Spike."
Rarity says: "It's the evidence against me!"
Gabby says: "Evidence?"
Gabby says: "For what?"
Rarity says: "For my acts of utter selfishness!"
Gabby says: "I don't understand."
Rarity says: "These are items I used to lure Spike into spending as much time with me as possible!"
Gabby says: "They are?"
Gabby says: "You did?"
Spike says: "Rarity?"
Spike says: "What are you doing?"
Rarity says: "Well, obviously I'm apologizing to Gabby so the two of you can renew your friendship, Spike."
Rarity says: "Now please, even if you can't forgive me, you simply must forgive—"
Rarity says: "Spike?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "Oh."
Rarity says: "I actually owe you an apology, too."
Gabby says: "You apologize a lot."
Rarity says: "I wish I didn't need to, but the more time you two spent together, the more I missed my time with Spike, and the more I used every means at my disposal to get it back."
Rarity says: "I am truly sorry."
Spike says: "You really miss spending time with me?"
Rarity says: "Oh, of course!"
Gabby says: "I have to say, after not hanging out with you, I understand why."
Gabby says: "You're kinda awesome!"
Gabby says: "And I know what it's like to miss that now, too."
Spike says: "So, do you think maybe we could start hanging out again?"
Gabby says: "Absolutely."
Spike says: "I don't suppose you'd like some company on your rounds right now?"
Gabby says: "I sure would!"
Rarity says: "Wonderful!"
Rarity says: "I can't tell you how pleased I am that the two of you have—"
Rarity says: "..."
Rarity says: "reconciled."
Rarity says: "I suppose Twilight is right."
Rarity says: "Friendships do change."
Rarity says: "Of course Spike and I will always be friends, and I can get used to sharing him."
Pinkie Pie says: "Sorry!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I just didn't want to drop another one and wake the bats."
Rarity says: "Darling."
Rarity says: "Catching the gems is what the basket is for."
Spike says: "Wow."
Spike says: "You two need to be a lot quieter."
Rarity says: "Spike!"
Rarity says: "How wonderful to see you!"
Spike says: "Yeah."
Spike says: "Gabby and I had a great day, but I'll always still want my Rarity time."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ohhhh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "So that's how it works!"
