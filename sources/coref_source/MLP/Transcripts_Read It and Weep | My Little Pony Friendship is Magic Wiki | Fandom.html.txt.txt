Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey, Rarity."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey, Pinkie Pie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are you looking at?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Isn't she the most daring devil?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I mean, the most devilish darer?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I mean—"
Rarity says: "She's dazzling!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh, yeah, that's a good word."
Pinkie Pie says: "She's dazzling!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh no, oh no, oh no!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ai yi yi yi yi!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oohh."
Rarity says: "Oohh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oohh."
Pinkie Pie says: "So much for dazzling."
Applejack says: "Is she gonna be okay?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, I'm so worried!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is her face gonna stay that way?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Awwww."
Twilight Sparkle says: "How is she, doctor?"
Doctor Horse says: "She's going to be fine."
Doctor Horse says: "Luckily she has friends like you who got her over here in a jiffy."
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh, how long do I need to lie here?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I've got things I need to do!"
Doctor Horse says: "Well, that all depends on your recovery, but I'd say a few days minimum."
Rainbow Dash says: "You guys have gotta get me out of here!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm gonna climb the walls!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh, just like a spider!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Did the crash somehow give her super-duper spider powers?"
Doctor Horse says: "Nnnno, nor did it give her amazing healing powers."
Doctor Horse says: "She needs to stay in bed for a few days."
Rainbow Dash says: "Few days?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Might as well be a few months, or a few years!"
Fluttershy says: "It's not so bad, Rainbow Dash."
Applejack says: "I bet the chow in here is hoof-lickin' good."
Rarity says: "And the hospital gowns, they..."
Rarity says: "match the curtains!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And look!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You have a roommate!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What's this?"
Rainbow Dash says: "'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Stone'."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is the first story in the series."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I own all of them."
Rainbow Dash says: "No thanks."
Rainbow Dash says: "I so don't read."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm a world-class athlete."
Rainbow Dash says: "Reading's for eggheads like you, Twilight."
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh, no offense, but I am not reading."
Rainbow Dash says: "It's undeniably, unquestionably, uncool."
Applejack says: "Is she serious?"
Applejack says: "Who doesn't like to read a bang-up tale from time to time?"
Rarity says: "Why, a good book is almost as magnificent as silk pajamas on a Sunday morning, heh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Reading is for everypony, Rainbow Dash!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I love reading, and my head isn't even close to the shape of an egg!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's more the shape of an apple, or maybe an orange, but a big orange!"
Pinkie Pie says: "More like a grapefruit really..."
"Nurse Sweetheart" says: "All right, my little ponies."
"Nurse Sweetheart" says: "Rainbow Dash needs her rest."
"Nurse Sweetheart" says: "You'll have to come back tomorrow."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I think you'd like Daring."
Twilight Sparkle says: "She's a lot like you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Adventurous, fierce, and undeniably, unquestionably, unstoppable."
Rainbow Dash says: "..."
Rainbow Dash says: "to get to the other side!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Get it?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Never mind..."
Dash's head banging on bed.
Rainbow Dash says: ""As Daring Do trekked through the tropical jungle, the wet heat sapped her energy and slowed her every step."
Rainbow Dash says: "If only she could escape this oppressive atmosphere and fly up into the cool blue sky."
Rainbow Dash says: "But her crash landing in the jungle had injured her wing and she was grounded for a few days."
Rainbow Dash says: "Few days..."
Rainbow Dash says: "it might as well be a few months, or a few years!"
Rainbow Dash says: "" Huh."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm right there with you, sister."
Rainbow Dash says: ""The mosquitoes buzzed loudly."
Rainbow Dash says: "The macaws cried from the high trees."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yet all of these distracting noises were not enough to cover the sound of the predators following her every step."
Rainbow Dash says: ""Safely landing on the other side, Daring finally allowed herself a moment to breathe."
Rainbow Dash says: "She turned around to find herself face to face with the long lost temple that she had sought tirelessly for over sixty days and nights!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I hate to admit it to myself, and would really hate to admit it to my friends, but..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I love this story!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I, I..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I love reading!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm an egghead."
Rainbow Dash says: ""The smell of decay and danger hit Daring Do as she peered into the dimly-lit entrance of the ancient temple."
[various noises says: "metal hitting stone, fire whooshing, alligators snapping, shing!"
[various noises says: ", etc."
Daring Do says: "Phew!"
Fluttershy says: "Hi, Rainbow Dash!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hi, Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, hey, guys..."
Fluttershy says: "We thought we'd come and cheer you up!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We brought your favorite board game!"
Fluttershy says: "We know how much you like to win!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You go first, Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "No no, you first."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Alright, uh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "cloud three."
Rainbow Dash says: "Aw, shucks, you..."
Rainbow Dash says: "rained on my cumulus, heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Go again!"
Fluttershy says: "Um..."
Fluttershy says: "sky five?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa, you found my seagull."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "cloud two?"
Rainbow Dash says: "You zapped my weather pony!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh-huh, you stung my bumblebee."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, my thunderbolt."
Rainbow Dash says: "Aw, and that's my last cloud."
Rainbow Dash says: "You found it."
Rainbow Dash says: "Guess you guys win, I lose."
Fluttershy says: "But Rainbow Dash, you, you didn't even get a turn."
Rainbow Dash says: "You win some, you lose some."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But you don't lose some."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't think you've ever lost a game of—"
Rainbow Dash says: "Thanks for coming!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But yesterday you were desperate for things to do!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Do?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Who said anything about Daring Do?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I told you I'm not interested in reading."
Fluttershy says: "Glad we could..."
Fluttershy says: "cheer you up?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Alright then."
Rainbow Dash says: ""Daring Do stood at the entrance to the central temple chamber."
Rainbow Dash says: ""At last, she was face-to-face with the legendary sapphire statue!"
Daring Do says: "Hmm, there must be a pattern here."
Daring Do says: "What do all these animals have in common?"
Daring Do says: "Ah-ha!"
Daring Do says: "These animals are all predators..."
Daring Do says: "except..."
Daring Do says: "rats!"
Daring Do says: "Phew!"
Ahuizotl says: "Hello, Rainbow Dash!"
Rarity says: "How's our patient doing today?"
Applejack says: "Ugh, we need to get some fresh air in here."
Applejack says: "You're lookin' sweatier than a pig wrangler on a summer's day."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, well, guys, thanks for visiting, but—"
Nurse Snowheart says: "Okay, now, dinner time for Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, just in time."
Rainbow Dash says: "I am sooo hungry."
Rarity says: "Oh, well, don't mind us, Rainbow Dash."
Applejack says: "Yeah, just go ahead and eat up."
Rarity says: "Uh, on second thought—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, we'll see you tomorrow, Rainbow Dash, aheh..."
Rainbow Dash says: ""'You thought you could evade me and capture the relic for yourself, but you are sadly mistaken, Miss Do."
Ahuizotl says: "And now, you shall meet your doom!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Who is this dude?"
Daring Do says: "You won't get away with this, Ahuizotl!"
Ahuizotl says: "But I already have."
Daring Do says: "Not again..."
Daring Do says: "Quicksand!"
Doctor Horse says: "Rainbow Dash?"
Doctor Horse says: "Rainbow Da-ash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "H—"
Rainbow Dash says: "oh, good evening—"
Doctor Horse says: "Morning."
Rainbow Dash says: "—"
Rainbow Dash says: "morning."
Rainbow Dash says: "Doc."
Doctor Horse says: "Have you been up all night?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, of course not."
Doctor Horse says: "Well, I'll be quick."
Doctor Horse says: "Congratulations, Rainbow Dash, we're checking you out of the hospital."
Rainbow Dash says: "What?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Later today?"
Doctor Horse says: "No."
Doctor Horse says: "Right now!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Right now?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "'Right now' right now?"
Doctor Horse says: "'Right now' right now."
Rainbow Dash says: "But I don't feel better!"
Doctor Horse says: "Now take it easy, Rainbow Dash."
Doctor Horse says: "Remember to stay off that wing for a week."
Rainbow Dash says: "How will I ever find out what happens to Daring Do?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Is Ahuizotl going to get away with the statuette?"
Rainbow Dash says: "What's gonna happen to Daring?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ah-ha!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Twilight has a copy of the book!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, but I can't ask her after I called her an egghead and all..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh, this is making me sick all over again!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Owww..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, the pain..."
Rainbow Dash says: "the pain!"
Doctor Horse says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Doctor Horse says: "What are you doing here, a-anything wrong?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, uh, my wing!"
Rainbow Dash says: "It's still hurtin', Doc."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, ouch!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Right there."
Doctor Horse says: "I was touching your good wing."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, right."
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, I think that one's hurting now too."
Doctor Horse says: "I think I know what the trouble is."
Doctor Horse says: "A severe case of lazy-itis."
Rainbow Dash says: "B-But, you got me all wrong, Doc!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm not being lazy!"
Doctor Horse says: "You're fine, Rainbow Dash."
Doctor Horse says: "Give it some time and you'll be right back in the swing of things."
"Nurse Sweetheart" says: "Good day, Rainbow Dash."
Nurse Snowheart says: "Take care!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What am I gonna do?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'll never get to sleep without knowing what happens to Daring Do!"
Rainbow Dash says: "..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Which may not be such a bad thing..."
Daring Do says: "Feels like the harder I struggle,  the tighter the ropes get!"
Spider says: "Help!"
Spider says: "Burglar, burglar!"
"Fuzzy Slippers" says: "Someone's trying to steal my slippers!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm not trying to steal your slippers, I'm trying to steal this book!"
"Nurse Sweetheart" says: "Stop, thief!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, nopony invited me!"
Rarity says: "Huh!"
Rarity says: "Hasn't anypony heard of beauty sleep?"
Doctor Horse says: "Rainbow Dash, what in the world is going on?"
Doctor Horse says: "Why are you stealing slippers?"
Night Watch says: "Hey, get back to the hospital!"
Applejack says: "What's all the ruckus?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Mmm, I'd say it's more of a fracas than a ruckus."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's going on, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm an egghead."
Rarity says: "Pardon?"
Rainbow Dash says: "See, I was trying to get back into the hospital to finish the last chapter of—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Statue'!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You got me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wow, I knew the book was good, but I didn't know it could drive a pony to petty theft!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Good?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Try awesomely amazing."
Rainbow Dash says: "That book is undeniably, unquestionably, un-put-down-able!"
Rainbow Dash says: "But then I had to put it down; I was sent home before I could finish it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, I'm glad that's all this is about."
Applejack says: "There's no reason to go around causin' a ruckus—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Fracas!"
Applejack says: "..."
Applejack says: "causin' a fracas just because you like to read."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Like I said, I have every book in the series, and you can borrow them all, any time you like!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, thanks, Twilight."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm sorry I made such a big deal about all of this."
Rainbow Dash says: "I thought reading was just for smart ponies like you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash, just because you're athletic doesn't mean you aren't smart!"
Spike says: "Yeah, just look at me!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Reading is something everypony can enjoy, if they just give it a try."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, I get it."
Rainbow Dash says: "I shouldn't knock something until I've tried it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's a great lesson, and it would make a great letter to the Princess."
Rainbow Dash says: "Didja get all that?"
Spike says: "Yeah?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Great!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You write the letter, I've gotta finish this book!"
Daring Do says: "Another day, another dungeon!"
Daring Do says: "I'll take that!"
Ahuizotl says: "Huh?"
Ahuizotl says: "Wha—"
Ahuizotl says: "?"
Ahuizotl says: "Noooooooo!"
Daring Do says: "Better luck next time, Ahuizotl!"
Ahuizotl says: "Curse you, Daring Do!"
Rainbow Dash says: ""And so, with Ahuizotl defeated, and the sapphire statue secured..."
Rainbow Dash says: ""..."
Rainbow Dash says: "The world was safe and sound once again, thanks to Daring Do!"
Rainbow Dash says: ""  'Daring Do and the Griffon's Goblet'."
Rainbow Dash says: "Awesome!"
