Rarity says: "Oh, Opalescence."
Rarity says: "Can't you just picture it?"
Rarity says: "Moi, stepping out in a stunning new gown at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!"
Rarity says: "Why, yes!"
Rarity says: "I did make it myself."
Rarity says: "Thank you so much for asking."
Rarity says: "Oh, Opal, of course you can help me."
Rarity says: "Thank you."
Rarity says: "What's that?"
Rarity says: "You want to help me more?"
Rarity says: "Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing?"
Rarity says: "Careful now."
Rarity says: "Don't move."
Rarity says: "This shouldn't take long at all."
Applejack says: "Howdy, Rarity!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Shh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "can't you see Rarity is trying to concentrate?"
Applejack says: "What do you think she's makin'?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Looks like a dress."
Applejack says: "Well, that makes sense."
Applejack says: "Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all."
Rarity says: "Is there something I can help you with?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, so very sorry to trouble you, Rarity, but I need a quick favor."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Could you please fix the button for me?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala."
Rarity says: "Oh, no, no, no!"
Rarity says: "You can't wear this..."
Rarity says: "old thing."
Rarity says: "You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala and I'll make it for you."
Rarity says: "No problem at all."
Rarity says: "It will be my pleasure!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer, Rarity, but I can't let you do that."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It would be so much work."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This dress is fine."
Rarity says: "Twilight Sparkle."
Rarity says: "I insist on making you a new dress."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But..."
Rarity says: "Not another word!"
Rarity says: "I won't take no for an answer."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, in that case..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "thank you for your generosity, Rarity."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure it will be absolutely beautiful."
Rarity says: "Let me guess, Applejack."
Rarity says: "You don't want a new gown either."
Applejack says: "Gown?"
Applejack says: "Shoot."
Applejack says: "I was just gonna wear my old work duds."
Rarity says: "You can't possibly be serious, Applejack!"
Rarity says: "You absolutely must wear formal attire."
Applejack says: "Hm..."
Applejack says: "nah."
Rarity says: "What if I just spruce up your..."
Rarity says: "duds for you a little bit?"
Applejack says: "Um..."
Applejack says: "okay, sure, why not?"
Applejack says: "Since you're up for it and all."
Applejack says: "Just don't make them too..."
Applejack says: "frou-frou-y."
Rarity says: "Deal!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Look out below!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Sorry."
Rainbow Dash says: "New trick."
Rainbow Dash says: "Didn't quite work."
Rarity says: "Hmm..."
Rarity says: "Idea!"
Rarity says: "I'll make you an outfit for the Gala too, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash says: "Outfit for the what now?"
Rarity says: "I'll make one for you and you and all of you."
Rarity says: "Oh!"
Rarity says: "And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too."
Rarity says: "Oh, and when I'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What a great idea!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "If you're sure you can handle it."
Rarity says: "Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business."
Rarity says: "Plus, fun!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, I love fun things!"
Rarity says: "Then it's settled."
Rarity says: "We'll have a fashion show starring us!"
Applejack says: "So all you have to do is make a different, stunning, original, amazing outfit for one, two, three, four, five—"
Applejack says: "plus yourself—"
Applejack says: "six ponies?"
Applejack says: "And lickety split?"
Rarity says: "Oh, Applejack."
Rarity says: "You make it sound as if it's going to be hard."

Rainbow Dash says: "Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining."
Rainbow Dash says: "She asked."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind."
Rarity says: "That's okay."
Rarity says: "Not a problem."
Rarity says: "There's plenty more where that came from."
Rarity says: "They were only a first pass."
Rarity says: "You're my friends and I want you to be one hundred and ten percent satisfied."

Gotta get them all done by tonight.
Pinkie Pie, that color's too obtrusive.
Wait until you see it in the light.
I'm sewing them together!

Spike says: "for the perfect pony gown."
Spike says: "Today, at long last, Equestria, your wait is over!"
Spike says: "Let's hear it for the breathtaking designs of Ponyville's own Rarity!"
Applejack says: "Why's everypony lookin' at us like that?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh dear."
Rainbow Dash says: "You think we overdid it?"
Applejack says: "Nah."
Applejack says: "Okay, maybe a little."

Hoity Toity says: "It's a travesty is what it is."
Hoity Toity says: "Those outfits are the ugliest things I've ever seen, oh for shame!"
Hoity Toity says: "Who is responsible for subjecting our eyes to these horrors?"
Hoity Toity says: "Not to mention wasting my valuable time."
Rarity says: "Oh!"
Rarity says: "Hide me."
Spike says: "Come on out and take a bow, Rarity."
Spike says: "You worked really hard for this."

Twilight Sparkle says: "Now what do we do?"
Fluttershy says: "Uh..."
Fluttershy says: "panic?"
Rainbow Dash says: "That's your answer for everything!"
Applejack says: "Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this."

Twilight Sparkle says: "She only has one cat."
Pinkie Pie says: "Give her time."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hm..."
Rarity says: "Exile..."
Rarity says: "I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile."
Rarity says: "Where would I go?"
Rarity says: "And what would I pack?"
Rarity says: "Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing."
Rarity says: "What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile?"
Rarity says: "Are you supposed to pack warm?"
Rarity says: "Huh?"

Rarity says: "What is it?"
Rarity says: "It's not..."
Rarity says: "you..."
Pinkie Pie says: "We all finished your dress for you."
Applejack says: "Thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing."
Fluttershy says: "Do you like it?"
Rarity says: "Like it?"
Rarity says: "Like it?!"

Rainbow Dash says: "We all saw how well that turned out."
Rarity says: "Oh, I forgive you."
Applejack says: "Well, that's mighty big of you."
Rarity says: "But my whole career is still ruined!"
Applejack says: "Oh, right."
Applejack says: "That."

Hoity Toity says: "All right, I haven't got all day."
Hoity Toity says: "Take two."
Hoity Toity says: "Hello..."

Hoity Toity says: "Brilliant!"
Hoity Toity says: "Oh, spectacular!"
Hoity Toity says: "Now this is a fashion show!"
