Fluttershy says: "Care for a carrot-ginger sandwich?"
Discord says: "Oh!"
Discord says: "You remembered to cut off the crusts for me."
Fluttershy says: "Of course I did."
Fluttershy says: "I know how you like them."
Discord says: "You really do make the best finger foods."
Discord says: "What do you say?"
Discord's finger says: "Excuse me."
Discord says: "I really can't take them anywhere."
Discord says: "Can I trouble you for another sugarcube?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, no."
Fluttershy says: "I'm so sorry, but I seem to be out."
Discord says: "Well, I can just pop us in some more."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, that's all right."
Fluttershy says: "I need to go to the market anyway."
Fluttershy says: "I have to restock my pantry for our tea party next week."
Discord says: "Oh."
Discord says: "I never realized how much work you put into hosting these tea parties."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, it's really not that much."
Discord says: "No, no, no, no, no!"
Discord says: "I've been taking advantage of your hospitality for far too long."
Discord says: "It's high time I do something about it."
Discord says: "What to do, what to do..."
Discord 2 says: "Why don't you host the next tea party?"
Discord says: "I've got it!"
Discord says: "Why don't I host the next tea party at my place?"
Discord 2 says: "Hey, that's my idea."
Discord 2 says: "Why didn't I see that coming?"
Discord says: "So, Fluttershy."
Discord says: "Mmmm!"
Discord says: "What do you think of my brilliant, genius, amazing idea of having the next tea party at my place?"
Fluttershy says: "Are you sure?"
Fluttershy says: "I wouldn't want you to go through any trouble."
Discord says: "You?"
Discord says: "Trouble?"
Discord says: "Never!"
Discord says: "I insist!"
Fluttershy says: "Then count me in."
Fluttershy says: "I'm already looking forward to it."
Discord says: "Me, too!"
Discord says: "I'm so excited!"
Discord says: "I can't wait!"
Discord says: "No, really, I can't!"
Discord says: "How about we have the tea party tomorrow afternoon?"
Fluttershy says: "Sounds good to me."
Fluttershy says: "You know, Discord, I've never been to your house before."
Discord says: "Well, that's okay, because I've never hosted a tea party before."
Discord says: "Oh!"
Discord says: "I've never hosted a tea party before!"
Discord says: "So much to do!"
Discord says: "Thank you so much for the tea and nibblies, but I really must be going!"
Fluttershy says: "Uh, Discord?"
Fluttershy says: "Before you go, would you mind helping me tidy up?"
Discord says: "There you go."
Discord says: "Back to normal, just the way you like it."
Discord says: "See you tomorrow!"
Discord says: "I can't wait!"
Discord says: "Okay."
Discord says: "Since Fluttershy always goes out of her way to host the perfect tea party for me, how do I make my tea party for her even more perfect?"
Pearly Stitch says: "I'm sorry, dearie."
Pearly Stitch says: "Were you talking to me?"
Discord says: "Actually, madam, I'm talking to myself."
Discord 2 says: "Well, I'm not talking to you!"
Discord says: "It's for Fluttershy!"
Discord 2 says: "Oh, all right."
Discord 2 says: "No more holes, though."
Discord 2 says: "You have to knock this tea party out of the park for her."
Discord 2 says: "She was our first friend, after all."
Discord says: "You don't have to tell me that."
Discord says: "She gave us a chance when no other pony would."
Discord 2 says: "She makes us want to be a better draconequus."
Discord 2 says: "Fluttershy deserves the best of everything."
Discord says: "Of course!"
Discord says: "I should get her the best of everything."
Discord says: "Why didn't I think of that?"
Discord says: "..."
Discord says: "Well?"
Discord says: "Are you going to answer me or not?"
Pearly Stitch says: "Me?"
Pearly Stitch says: "Uh, I thought you were talking to..."
Discord says: "No time!"
Discord says: "I'm off to prepare a tea party worthy of Fluttershy!"
Discord says: "Excuse me."
Discord says: "Is this where Fluttershy usually buys her tea?"
"Jasmine Leaf" says: "Why, yes, it is."
Discord says: "Oh, wonderful!"
Discord says: "I'll be enjoying her company tomorrow, so I will be needing your very best tea, please."
Discord says: "Something especially special."
"Jasmine Leaf" says: "I'm sure Fluttershy would enjoy some of our rose hip green tea."
Discord says: "Oh, interesting."
Discord says: "Does it decorate your hips in roses or turn you green?"
"Jasmine Leaf" says: "Uh..."
"Jasmine Leaf" says: "neither?"
"Jasmine Leaf" says: "It just tastes good."
Discord says: "How boring."
Discord says: "Pass."
Discord says: "Hold on!"
Discord says: "Ginseng tea!"
Discord says: "Now that sounds promising."
Discord says: "What does it sing?"
Discord says: "I'm partial to something upbeat and jazzy."
"Jasmine Leaf" says: "Again, it's just tasty like all of our tea here."
Discord says: "So..."
Discord says: "all of this is just tea you simply drink?"
"Jasmine Leaf" says: "Uh-huh."
Discord says: "Ohhhh, it seems that I got here just in time."
Discord says: "Singing ginseng!"
Discord says: "I'll take it!"
"Jasmine Leaf" says: "Are you sure you're friends with Fluttershy?"
"Jasmine Leaf" says: "You seem so very different from her."
Discord says: "Well, of course we're friends!"
Discord says: "She gets me, and you obviously do not!"
Discord says: "The very nerve!"
Discord says: "I'm sorry."
Discord says: "Do you validate?"
Discord says: "Hello!"
"Raspberry Vinaigrette" says: "Uh, can I help you find something?"
Discord says: "Yes, you can."
Discord says: "Your finest tea set, please."
Discord says: "I want only the best for my friend Fluttershy."
"Raspberry Vinaigrette" says: "Uh..."
"Raspberry Vinaigrette" says: "you're friends with Fluttershy?"
Discord says: "Yes..."
Discord says: "judgy..."
Discord says: "clerk..."
Discord says: "pony!"
Discord says: "Why is it such a surprise?"
Discord says: "Sure, she's on the quieter side, and I'm a bit, well, more showy."
Discord says: "But I'll have you know we're besties."
Discord says: "And that's why I need the  best tea set!"
"Raspberry Vinaigrette" says: "Uh, perhaps then you'd be interested in our classic tea-for-two set."
Discord says: "A teapot that just pours tea?"
Discord says: "How positively dreadful!"
"Raspberry Vinaigrette" says: "But that's all teapots are supposed to do."
Discord says: "Not anymore!"
Discord says: "Now, let's see."
Discord says: "I have the perfect tea and the perfect tea service."
Discord says: "What else do I need for the perfect tea party?"
Discord says: "Oh!"
Discord says: "Decorations, of course!"
Discord says: "Good..."
Discord says: "but not nearly good enough for Fluttershy."
Discord says: "and fold!"
Discord says: "Glow, fly, fold into fun shapes, perhaps?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, Discord?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Are you okay?"
Discord says: "Pinkie Pie!"
Discord says: "Just the pony I need."
Discord says: "As the party pony and Fluttershy's close – but not best – friend, I need your advice."
Discord says: "I'm hosting a tea party for her, and it has to be perfect."
Discord says: "No!"
Discord says: "It has to be even better than perfect!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, Discord."
Pinkie Pie says: "You're waaaaaay overthinking things."
Pinkie Pie says: "All you have to do is make Fluttershy feel comfortable."
Pinkie Pie says: "It should be pretty easy for you."
Pinkie Pie says: "You know her so well!"
Discord says: "And that's why you're the party expert."
Discord says: "Thank you, Pinkie Pie."
Discord says: "I feel so much better now."
Pinkie Pie says: "Eh, it's what I do."
Pinkie Pie says: "Excuse me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Where can I find the glowing, flying, self-folding napkins?"
Discord says: "Make Fluttershy feel comfortable, make Fluttershy feel comfortable, comfortable, comfortable..."
Discord says: "Well, I mean, that shouldn't be a problem."
Discord says: "Oh, dear."
Discord says: "That might be a problem."
Discord says: "Maybe it's not as bad as I think."
Discord says: "Maybe Fluttershy would be comfortable having a tea party here."
Discord says: "Maybe I just need another set of eyes on this."
Discord says: "What do you think?"
Discord says: "That bad?"
Discord 2 says: "No, worse!"
Discord 2 says: "Fluttershy would never be comfortable here!"
Discord 2 says: "What have you done?!"
Discord 2 says: "!"
Discord says: "I was trying to make the tea party different and special like me."
Discord says: "But all I did was make it chaotic and weird..."
Discord says: "like me."
Discord says: "What if those ponies at the tea shop and the china shop were right?"
Discord says: "What if Fluttershy sees how crazy this place is and realizes how different we are?"
Discord says: "And then doesn't want to be friends anymore?!"
Discord says: "!"
Discord 2 says: "Relax!"
Discord 2 says: "We can fix this."
Discord 2 says: "Time to call in the team."
Discord 2 says: "Okay, chief."
Discord 2 says: "What's the plan?"
Discord says: "What to do, what to do, what to do..."
Discord says: "Oh!"
Discord says: "Got it!"
Discord says: "We know Fluttershy, and we know what she likes."
Discord says: "First of all, we need to get rid of all the new stuff."
Discord 2 says: "You heard him!"
Discord 2 says: "Strike the new stuff!"
Piñata says: "Bleh!"
Discord 3 says: "Piñatas hate bats."
Discord says: "Enjoy your all-expense-paid trip around Equestria!"
Discord says: "Well done, everybody, but there's still more work to do."
Discord says: "We need to make this place more Fluttershy and less, well, me."
Discord says: "One thing I know about my dear friend is that she loves comfy chairs."
Discord says: "But not on the ceiling."
Discord says: "And I'm almost certain she likes stairs..."
Discord says: "..."
Discord says: "that lead somewhere."
Discord says: "And although we've never discussed it, I'm pretty sure Fluttershy likes gravity."
Discord says: "Okay, fellas!"
Discord says: "This is a good start, but stand back."
Discord says: "Let me show you how it's done."
Discord says: "We just need some of this."
Discord says: "And a little of that."
Discord says: "And a whole lot of those!"
Discord says: "Phew!"
Discord 2 says: "How boring."
Discord 2 says: "I mean, normal."
Discord says: "Thank you!"
Discord 2 says: "Good job."
Discord 2 says: "The window treatments are perfectly unexceptional."
Discord says: "But we're not done yet."
Discord 2 says: "You don't mean..."
Discord says: "Mm-hmm."
All Discords says: "Makeover!"
Discord 2 says: "Hating it."
Discord 2 says: "Hating it."
Discord 2 says: "Hating it."
Discord 2 says: "Hating..."
Discord 2 says: "how much I love it!"
Discord says: "Okay, let's give these conversation cards a whirl."
Discord says: ""It is very nice to see you today."
Discord says: "" "Have you read any good books lately?"
Discord says: "" "Your garden looks positively lovely."
Discord says: "Huh."
Discord says: "Quite strange."
Discord says: "For the first time in my life, I don't feel quite strange."
Discord says: "In fact, I feel..."
Discord says: "completely normal."
Discord says: "Everything is finally perfect for Fluttershy."
Discord says: "And just in time."
Fluttershy says: "Discord!"
Fluttershy says: "I'm so excited to finally see where you live!"
Discord says: "G-Greetings, friend."
Discord says: "Please do come in."
Fluttershy says: "I can't wait to see how..."
Fluttershy says: "uh..."
Fluttershy says: "Oh."
Discord says: "Is something amiss?"
Fluttershy says: "Um, no, no, not at all."
Fluttershy says: "It's just not what I expected."
Fluttershy says: "It's quite..."
Fluttershy says: "lovely."
Discord says: "Please have a seat."
Fluttershy says: "Where is it?"
Discord says: "Right here."
Fluttershy says: "Oh."
Discord says: "I think you'll be quite pleased with the green tea I've selected for us today."
Fluttershy says: "Oooh!"
Fluttershy says: "Does it actually turn us green?"
Fluttershy says: "Is it really envious of the other teas?"
Fluttershy says: "What's it do, what's it do?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Discord says: "Uh, well, it tastes delicious."
Fluttershy says: "Oh..."
Fluttershy says: "Okay."
Discord says: "What particularly nice weather we're having."
Fluttershy says: "Yes..."
Fluttershy says: "Yes, we are."
Discord says: "It did rain the other day, however."
Fluttershy says: "Uh-huh..."
Discord says: "But the weather today is particularly nice."
Discord says: "..."
Discord says: "As I previously mentioned."
Discord says: "Would you care for some milk toast?"
Fluttershy says: "Uh, Discord, you don't seem to be yourself today."
Fluttershy says: "Are you feeling all right?"
Discord says: "Whatever do you mean?"
Fluttershy says: "Well, it's just..."
Fluttershy says: "what you're wearing."
Fluttershy says: "And also what you're saying."
Fluttershy says: "And also the way you're saying it."
Fluttershy says: "And, um, pretty much everything else."
Discord says: "Oh, dear Fluttershy, worry not."
Discord says: "I can assure you that for the first time, I'm feeling perfectly normal."
Discord says: "Now, let me top you off."
Discord says: "Oops!"
Discord says: "Butterfingers!"
Discord says: "How embarrassing."
Fluttershy says: "Uh, what's going on?"
Discord says: "I have..."
Discord says: "no idea."
Fluttershy says: "Discord!"
Fluttershy says: "You're starting to fade away!"
Discord says: "Oh, you don't say..."
Discord says: "Have you read any good books lately?"
Discord says: "Huh."
Discord says: "Have you tried the scones?"
Discord says: "They're positively delectable."
Discord says: "The secret is in the extra butter."
Fluttershy says: "What is wrong with you?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "You're acting so normal, which is not so normal for you!"
Discord says: "Well, whatever do you mean?"
Discord says: "This is just me being me."
Fluttershy says: "No, it's not!"
Fluttershy says: "It's you being like everypony else!"
Fluttershy says: "Eeeek!"
Fluttershy says: "The more you do it, the more you fade away!"
Fluttershy says: "Of course!"
Fluttershy says: "You're a creature of pure chaos!"
Fluttershy says: "Being normal is destroying you!"
Discord says: "How interesting."
Discord says: "That reminds me of something I heard at the market today."
Fluttershy says: "Stop it!"
Fluttershy says: "Please!"
Fluttershy says: "You need to go back to being your not-normal normal self!"
Fluttershy says: "Quick, Discord!"
Fluttershy says: "Uh, do something chaotic before it's too late!"
Fluttershy says: "Please!"
Discord says: "Do something chaotic?"
Discord says: "I'll try..."
Discord says: "Ohhhh, that's not good..."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, no!"
Fluttershy says: "I tipped over that cup!"
Fluttershy says: "That's pretty chaotic, right?"
Fluttershy says: "How wacky!"
Fluttershy says: "Doing anything for ya?"
Fluttershy says: "Okay."
Fluttershy says: "Hmm."
Fluttershy says: "Maybe I need to start thinking like you."
Fluttershy says: "Ohhh..."
Fluttershy says: "What would Discord do?"
Fluttershy says: "Well, I guess he'd probably make another version of himself to bounce ideas off of."
Fluttershy says: "But one wouldn't be enough."
Fluttershy says: "He'd need more!"
Fluttershy says: "Way more!"
Fluttershy says: "On it!"
Fluttershy says: "Better..."
Fluttershy says: "but it still needs something."
Fluttershy says: "Now, that's more like it!"
Fluttershy says: "It's working!"
Fluttershy says: "Okay, what else?"
Fluttershy says: "Furniture on the ground?"
Fluttershy says: "So predictable!"
Fluttershy says: "Let's put them where they don't belong!"
Fluttershy says: "And he'd have a chaise lounge that would actually chase you!"
Fluttershy says: "Because he's funny like that!"
Fluttershy says: "Bet you can't catch me!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh!"
Fluttershy says: "And Discord would have a special kind of tea!"
Fluttershy says: "Like a ginseng that could really sing!"
Discord says: "I would."
Discord says: "I-I would!"
Fluttershy says: "And he'd serve it on a floating table!"
Fluttershy says: "We never talked about it, but I'm pretty sure Discord hates gravity!"
Discord says: "I do!"
Discord says: "Who wants to be tethered to the ground when you can do this?"
Fluttershy says: "Now this is exactly what I was hoping for!"
Discord says: "This is what you were hoping for?"
Discord says: "But this is the complete opposite of your tea parties."
Fluttershy says: "I wouldn't expect you to throw a tea party the way I would."
Fluttershy says: "We're different!"
Discord says: "I know."
Discord says: "I was afraid that if you saw exactly how different we are, you wouldn't want to be friends anymore."
Fluttershy says: "What?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Why would you ever think that?"
Discord says: "Because you and I don't make sense to anypony else."
Fluttershy says: "That may be true, but we make sense to me."
Fluttershy says: "I never would've thought to make singing ginseng before I met you."
Fluttershy says: "But you've opened me up to so many more possibilities and impossibilities."
Fluttershy says: "So I guess what I'm trying to say is I like you because you're so different from me."
Discord says: "You do?"
Fluttershy says: "Of course I do, silly!"
Fluttershy says: "Besides, what's discord without a little chaos?"
Discord says: "Well!"
Discord says: "In that case, I certainly don't need to be wearing this."
Discord says: "Oops!"
Discord says: "I forgot that I still had this on!"
Fluttershy says: "Now, about that tea party..."
Fluttershy says: "You know, your garden really is looking lovely."
Discord says: "Why, thank you for noticing."
Discord says: "I also couldn't help but notice that you need a refill."
Fluttershy says: "Gesundheit."
Discord says: "It really is nice having you here."
Fluttershy says: "I'm happy to be here."
Fluttershy says: "And I really do like your place."
Fluttershy says: "Because it's so you."
Discord says: "Why, thank you, Fluttershy."
Fluttershy says: "Now, how about we try some of those delicious-looking sandwiches?"
Discord says: "You read my mind!"
