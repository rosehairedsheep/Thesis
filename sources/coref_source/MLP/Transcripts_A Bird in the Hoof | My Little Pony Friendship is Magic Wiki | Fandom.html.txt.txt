Fluttershy says: "There you go, Mr."
Fluttershy says: "Mousey."
Fluttershy says: "Now you stay off that leg and do everything I told you."
Fluttershy says: "And it will be just like new in no time at all."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, you're welcome."
Fluttershy says: "Happy to be able to help."
Fluttershy says: "You..."
Fluttershy says: "found a watch?"
Fluttershy says: "You..."
Fluttershy says: "wanna be a watch?"
Fluttershy says: "You're running!"
Fluttershy says: "Running out of time?"
Fluttershy says: "No."
Fluttershy says: "You're..."
Fluttershy says: "late?"
Fluttershy says: "I'm late for a very important date!"
Fluttershy says: "The big brunch for Princess Celestia at Sugarcube Corner."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, the princess is here in Ponyville for a party, and we all promised we'd be there."
Fluttershy says: "But I'm not there!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, do I look all right?"
Fluttershy says: "Do I need to bring anything?"
Fluttershy says: "Maybe I shouldn't go."
Fluttershy says: "Aah!"
Fluttershy says: "It's starting!"
Fluttershy says: "I'm missing it!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, thanks, Angel."
Fluttershy says: "I mean, if you hadn't reminded me, I might have not remembered, and then I wouldn't be there, and everypony would be wondering where I was and..."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, right."
Fluttershy says: "I'm late."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, okay then."
Fluttershy says: "See you later."
Rainbow Dash says: "So..."
Rainbow Dash says: "what do I have to do to get to be one of the Princess's royal guards, anyway?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Is the pay good?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hellooo?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Anybody home?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Too good."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm bored."
Fluttershy says: "Phew."
Fluttershy says: "Made it."
Guard 1 says: "Halt!"
Guard 2 says: "Who goes there?"
Fluttershy says: "No one."
Fluttershy says: "Never mind."
Fluttershy says: "I'll go home."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's all right, sirs."
Twilight Sparkle says: "She's on the list."
Fluttershy says: "Thanks, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm so glad you could make it, Fluttershy."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It wouldn't be the same without you."
Mr. Cake says: "How's everypony doing?"
Mr. Cake says: "Good?"
Mr. Cake says: "Good."
Mrs. Cake says: "Anything else we can get for you, dearies..."
Mrs. Cake says: "?"
Mrs. Cake says: "Ooh, I-I mean, esteemed guests."
Princess Celestia says: "Everything is fine, Mr."
Princess Celestia says: "and Mrs."
Princess Celestia says: "Cake."
Fluttershy says: "Sorry I'm late."
Fluttershy says: "I had to finish taking care of a patient first."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, you and your tender loving care of little animals."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I just know Princess Celestia is gonna love that about you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I mean, I hope she will..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I mean, of course she will!"
Fluttershy says: "Wow, Twilight."
Fluttershy says: "I thought I was the only one who got nervous at social gatherings."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, it's not that."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I just want the princess to approve of my friends."
Fluttershy says: "But she's met us all before."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And read about you in my letters."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But this is the first time she's spent any real time with you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I want everypony to make a good impression."
Fluttershy says: "Well, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about."
Fluttershy says: "Besides, it's just a casual get-together, right?"
Rarity says: "Don't touch me!"
Rarity says: "Watch the dress!"
Rarity says: "Careful, you're gonna spill that on me!"
Rarity says: "Oh, oh, that looks delicious."
Rarity says: "What is it?"
Rarity says: "Oh, does it stain?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "Keep it away from me!"
Fluttershy says: "Or..."
Fluttershy says: "perhaps not that casual."
Applejack says: "Uh..."
Applejack says: "which is the salad and which is the appetizer again?"
Applejack says: "And which am I supposed to eat first?"
Applejack says: "Oh, never mind."
Applejack says: "I'm not hungry."
Fluttershy says: "It's okay, Twilight."
Fluttershy says: "So our friends' manners aren't perfect."
Fluttershy says: "I doubt the princess will even notice."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey!"
Mr. Cake says: "A thousand pardons, Your Majesty."
Princess Celestia says: "That's quite all right, thank you."
Mrs. Cake says: "Empty teacup at 4 o'clock!"
Mr. Cake says: "Uh, I see it, honey bun!"
Princess Celestia says: "Oh, um..."
Princess Celestia says: "thank you."
Mr. Cake says: "Not at all, Your Highness."
Princess Celestia says: "Thank you again."
Mrs. Cake says: "Oh, but of course, Your Majesty."
Princess Celestia says: "Gotcha!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh..."
Princess Celestia says: "And what about you, dear?"
Princess Celestia says: "Fluttershy, is it?"
Fluttershy says: "Me?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh yes, Your Highness."
Princess Celestia says: "I understand from Twilight Sparkle's letters that you enjoy tending to the needs of woodland creatures."
Fluttershy says: "Yes, I love to take care of animals."
Princess Celestia says: "As do I."
Princess Celestia says: "As Princess, I care deeply about all creatures, great and small."
Princess Celestia says: "Nothing means more to me than the well-being of all my subjects."
Princess Celestia says: "Ah, Philomena, my pet."
Princess Celestia says: "You're awake."
Princess Celestia says: "Do say hello to our gracious hosts."
Fluttershy says: "Oh..."
Fluttershy says: "my."
Princess Celestia says: "She is quite a sight, isn't she?"
Fluttershy says: "I..."
Fluttershy says: "I..."
Fluttershy says: "I've never seen anything like it."
Princess Celestia says: "Really?"
Princess Celestia says: "Well, if I must..."
Princess Celestia says: "I'm sorry, everypony."
Princess Celestia says: "I'm afraid I have to cut the party short."
Princess Celestia says: "The mayor has requested an audience with me."
Princess Celestia says: "Royal duty calls."
Princess Celestia says: "Thank you for a wonderful time."
Princess Celestia says: "It's been a joy getting to know you all better."
Applejack says: "Phew!"
Applejack says: "Now I can eat someth'n!"
Applejack says: "I'm starved!"
Applejack says: "Oh..."
Rarity says: "Stay right where you are."
Rarity says: "All I want is a clear path to the exit."
Rarity says: "Nobody move and my dress won't get hurt!"
Rarity says: "Stay back!"
Rarity says: "Back, I say!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, Spike, I don't know for sure how things went with the princess, but at least no big disasters happened."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, you poor little thing."
Fluttershy says: "How did you ever get in such bad condition?"
Fluttershy says: "Don't you worry, Philomena."
Fluttershy says: "I'll nurse you back to health."
Fluttershy says: "As a favor to the princess, who's obviously just far too busy to care for you properly."
Fluttershy says: "I'm sure the princess will appreciate the help."
Fluttershy says: "Oh my."
Fluttershy says: "We'd better get you to bed right away."
Fluttershy says: "There."
Fluttershy says: "This is far worse than I thought."
Fluttershy says: "What you need is some medicine."
Fluttershy says: "Stat!"
Fluttershy says: "Here you go, Philomena."
Fluttershy says: "This will fix you right up."
Fluttershy says: "Doctor Fluttershy expected that."
Fluttershy says: "Always works."
Fluttershy says: "Uh..."
Fluttershy says: "almost always."
Fluttershy says: "There's nothing like homemade soup to cure what ails you."
Fluttershy says: "Come on now."
Fluttershy says: "You're not gonna get better if you don't cooperate."
Fluttershy says: "Mmm..."
Fluttershy says: "see?"
Fluttershy says: "It's delicious."
Fluttershy says: "Good and good for you."
Fluttershy says: "Here comes the choo-choo train."
Fluttershy says: "Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo-whoo!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh dear."
Fluttershy says: "Don't worry, Philomena."
Fluttershy says: "I know what'll make you feel better."
Fluttershy says: "Wait right here."
Fluttershy says: "I have just the thing."
Fluttershy says: "Look, Philomena."
Fluttershy says: "I brought a fellow feathered friend by to cheer you up."
Fluttershy says: "Hummingway here was sick once too, but he let me help him and got better in no time."
Fluttershy says: "Didn't you, boy?"
Fluttershy says: "Say hello to your new friend Philomena."
Fluttershy says: "Aw, look."
Fluttershy says: "I think he likes you."
Fluttershy says: "Your turn now, Philomena."
Fluttershy says: "Go ahead."
Fluttershy says: "You can do it."
Fluttershy says: "Oh!"
Fluttershy says: "Um..."
Fluttershy says: "good try?"
Fluttershy says: "I know what'll clear up that tickle in your throat."
Fluttershy says: "A humidifier."
Fluttershy says: "Refreshing."
Fluttershy says: "How's that feeling now for you, Philomena?"
Fluttershy says: "Better?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh..."
Fluttershy says: "that's okay."
Fluttershy says: "I know lots of other ways to take care of you."
Fluttershy says: "Don't worry."
Fluttershy says: "You're gonna get better."
Fluttershy says: "How about..."
Fluttershy says: "Aromatherapy?"
Fluttershy says: "Warm bath?"
Fluttershy says: "Ointment?"
Fluttershy says: "Scalpel."
Fluttershy says: "Surgical tape."
Fluttershy says: "Feathers."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, Philomena."
Fluttershy says: "I thought it would be easy to nurse you back to health."
Fluttershy says: "I've tried everything I know."
Fluttershy says: "And look at you."
Fluttershy says: "You're worse than ever."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hi, Fluttershy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I just wanted to drop by and say thank you so very much for making such a good impression on the princess today..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What is Celestia's pet doing here?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "I couldn't leave the poor thing there."
Fluttershy says: "She needed my help."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh no."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nonononononono!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is bad."
Fluttershy says: "How could I just walk away and not do anything?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "but..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "she doesn't belong to you!"
Fluttershy says: "I had to do something."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Without telling anypony?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Without asking permission?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "But..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know you had good intentions, but you have got to return the princess's pet!"
Fluttershy says: "But..."
Fluttershy says: "You're right."
Fluttershy says: "Okay, let's..."
Fluttershy says: "..."
Fluttershy says: "go."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If we hurry, we can put her back before anypony even realizes she's missing."
Guard 1 says: "We were told we could find Twilight Sparkle here."
Guard 2 says: "We regret to inform you, miss, that the royal pet has gone missing."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Really?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You don't say!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's that dry night air?"
Fluttershy says: "But it's daytime."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "day air's even drier."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You guards better be on your way if you're gonna find the princess's missing pet."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Philomena, was it?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thank you ever so much for keeping me in the loop."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Bye!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Phew..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What are you doing?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Going to return Philomena, remember?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We can't now!"
Fluttershy says: "Why not?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You have no idea what the princess is gonna do if she finds you're the one who took her pet, do you?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Do you?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "no."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But it can't be anything good."
Twilight Sparkle says: "She might banish you from Equestria."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Or throw you in a dungeon."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon in the place that she banishes you to!"
Fluttershy says: "You really think the princess would do that?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Granted that probably won't happen, but do you wanna take any chances?"
Fluttershy says: "All that really matters to me is that poor little Philomena here gets well."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's very noble of you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll write to you when you're banished."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Unless I'm banished to somewhere there's no post office."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Then you'll have to write to me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Deal?"
Fluttershy says: "Please, Twilight."
Fluttershy says: "You just have to help me get Philomena healthy and then we can return her to the princess."
Fluttershy says: "And everything will be fine."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Did you give her any kind of medicine?"
Fluttershy says: "I tried to, but she wouldn't take it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Then you have to make her take it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You can't be such a pushover, Fluttershy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You need to show this patient who's the boss."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Make her straighten up and fly right!"
Fluttershy says: "She can't fly."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No excuses!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Done."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, what else?"
Fluttershy says: "Uh..."
Fluttershy says: "well, she keeps pulling her feathers off."
Fluttershy says: "The ones that haven't fallen out yet from all her coughing, I mean."
Twilight Sparkle says: "There you go."
Fluttershy says: "I don't think she likes it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Tough love, baby."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You want her to get well, don't you?"
Fluttershy says: "Of course, but..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Next!"
Fluttershy says: "Well, she desperately needs some bed rest, but I can't get her to stay put."
Twilight Sparkle says: "One step ahead of you."
Fluttershy says: "It's for your own good, Philomena, I promise."
Fluttershy says: "Please, just relax and try to get some sleep."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's this soup over here?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Smells delicious."
Fluttershy says: "I made it for Philomena."
Fluttershy says: "But she wouldn't eat it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, she'll eat it, all right."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where are you going?"
Fluttershy says: "No!"
Fluttershy says: "Philomena!"
Fluttershy says: "Come back!"
Benny Hill-esque music.
Rainbow Dash says: "What are you two doing?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Are you having a race?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, can I play?"
Rainbow Dash says: "One, two, three, go!"
Fluttershy says: "Excuse me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hi!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Beg your pardon!"
Rarity says: "Put me down!"
Applejack says: "What in tarnation?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Sorry, but we've gotta find..."
Guard says: "The princess's pet bird!"
Fluttershy says: "Philomena, come down from there!"
Fluttershy says: "You'll hurt yourself!"
Fluttershy says: "I'll catch you!"
Philomena bursts into flames.
Princess Celestia says: "What is going on here?"
Princess Celestia says: "Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes, your Majesty, there's been a terrible accident."
Fluttershy says: "It's all my fault."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, Princess."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy didn't know any better."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It was my fault."
Fluttershy says: "I'm the one who did it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But you were only trying to help."
Fluttershy says: "Some help I was."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Will ya let me do this?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "She'll go easier on me."
Fluttershy says: "But it's my fault!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, it's my fault!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No, it's my fault!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait, what are we talking about?"
Fluttershy says: "Thanks for trying to protect me, Twilight, but..."
Fluttershy says: "Princess Celestia, I'm the one who took your pet bird."
Fluttershy says: "I really was only trying to help the poor little thing."
Fluttershy says: "Then I was gonna bring it right back to you, honest."
Fluttershy says: "So, if you wanna banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to, then that's what I deserve."
Princess Celestia says: "Oh, stop fooling around, Philomena."
Princess Celestia says: "You're scaring everypony."
Fluttershy says: "I don't understand!"
Fluttershy says: "What is that thing?"
Fluttershy says: "What happened to Philomena?"
Princess Celestia says: "This is Philomena."
Princess Celestia says: "She's quite a sight, as I said."
Princess Celestia says: "But nothing unusual for a phoenix."
Princess Celestia says: "Isn't that right, Philomena?"
Fluttershy says: "A..."
Fluttershy says: "A phoenix?"
Princess Celestia says: "A phoenix is a majestic and magical bird."
Princess Celestia says: "While it appears healthy and happy most of the time, every so often it must renew itself by shedding all of its feathers and bursting into flame."
Princess Celestia says: "It then rises from the ashes, fresh as a daisy."
Princess Celestia says: "All just a normal part of the life cycle of a phoenix."
Princess Celestia says: "I'm afraid mischievous little Philomena here took the occasion to have a little fun with you, Fluttershy."
Princess Celestia says: "Say you're sorry, young lady."
Fluttershy says: "So..."
Fluttershy says: "aren't you gonna banish me?"
Fluttershy says: "Or throw me in a dungeon?"
Fluttershy says: "Or banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to?"
Princess Celestia says: "Of course not, my little pony."
Princess Celestia says: "Where on Earth would you get such an idea?"
Fluttershy says: "I guess I have some imagination."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy really did do everything she could to try to take care of Philomena for you."
Princess Celestia says: "And I do appreciate that your heart was in the right place, child."
Princess Celestia says: "But all you had to do was ask me and I could have told you Philomena was a phoenix and saved you all this trouble."
Fluttershy says: "I know."
Fluttershy says: "I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions."
Fluttershy says: "Next time I'll ask before taking matters into my own hooves."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Should I write you a letter about that lesson, Princess?"
Princess Celestia says: "No, that's quite all right."
Princess Celestia says: "I think I can remember."
Fluttershy says: "It's beautiful."
Fluttershy says: "Thank you, Philomena."
Fluttershy says: "No hard feelings."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hmm..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, you know what you should do?"
Rainbow Dash says: "You should go over there and tickle them!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah!"
