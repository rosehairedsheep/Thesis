Pinkie Pie says: "We're going to Manehattan, we're going to Manehattan, we're going to Manehattan..."
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Rarity says: "Yes, yes, Manehattan, the height of sophistication, elegance, culture..."
Rarity says: "Since my boutique in Canterlot has been doing so nicely, it only makes sense for me to open one there as well."
Pinkie Pie says: "We're almost there!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Why doesn't your face look like this?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Eee..."
Rarity says: "Oh, Pinkie, dear, this is just a business trip for me."
Rarity says: "I need to scour the city for the most perfect location for my new shop."
Rarity says: "And while it's lovely how excited you are, there's absolutely no chance of me getting swept into the–  energy, the beauty, the majesty of the greatest city in all of Equestria!"
Rarity says: "This city's simply a-ma-zing!"
Rarity says: "It's just..."
Rarity says: "everything, ever!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And it's about to get everything ever-er!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Because guess who I see!"
Pinkie Pie says: "M-A-U-D!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You know what that spells?"
Maud Pie says: "It spells Maud."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud, Maud, Maud!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yay!"
Rarity says: "Oh, you Pie sisters have just about the sweetest family traditions!"
Rarity says: "Every year, you set aside a special day to spend with each of your sisters?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yep!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I do separate trips with each one, and we make it super fun by picking a different location every year!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We see the sights all day and then swap gifts at sunset!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And since Maud's getting her rocktorate nearby, we figured this would be the perfect spot for PSSSD!"
Rarity says: "Okay, what's the secret?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Huh?"
Rarity says: "You just said 'pssst'."
Pinkie Pie says: "No, silly!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Not pssst, PSSSD!"
Pinkie Pie says: "P-S-S-S-D!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pie Sisters Surprise Swap Day!"
Rarity says: "Maud!"
Maud Pie says: "Boulder promised his cousin a postcard."
Rarity says: "Well, I'll just leave you two to your PSSSD."
Rarity says: "And now, I am off to scout possible locations for my new boutique!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Before you go, can I ask you a quick question?"
Rarity says: "Oh, of course."
Pinkie Pie says: "Will you please help me?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Rarity says: "Only if you let go of my leg and stand up..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Every year, Maud's PSSSD gift always blows mine away!"
Pinkie Pie says: "But this year is going to be different!"
Pinkie Pie says: "For the first time, I'm finally getting her a gift that's as good as the one she always gets me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "There's a specialty store here in Manehattan that sells nothing but rock pouches!"
Pinkie Pie says: "A rock pouch would be perfect for Boulder, and I know Maud will love it!"
Rarity says: "Why, Pinkie, that really is the perfect gift for Maud!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I know, right?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Problem is, I still need to buy one, and the store is downtown!"
Rarity says: "Hmm, and you want to get a pouch for Maud without ruining the surprise..."
Rarity says: "Well, luckily for you, I know exactly what you should do!"
Rarity says: "Why not sight-see on a path that leads right to the pouch store?"
Rarity says: "That way Maud won't get suspicious!"
Rarity says: "I'll come with you to distract Maud, so..."
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "I can sneak away to pick out a rock pouch!"
Rarity says: "Y-Yes, yes, yes, let's not get too excited until you actually get a pouch for Maud."
Pinkie Pie says: "Of course."
Pinkie Pie says: "Got it."
Pinkie Pie says: "Absolutely."
Maud Pie says: "Nothing moved him."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm giving you the greatest PSSSD gift in the history of ever!"
Rarity says: "Oh, what a spectacular view!"
Rarity says: "You really can see everything from here!"
Maud Pie says: "Especially the glaciation of the sloping strata."
Maud Pie says: "It's breathtaking."
Pinkie Pie says: "But not half as breathtaking as the gift I'm giving you!"
Rarity says: "I-It certainly is–  –cozy..."
Rarity says: "but this simply won't do!"
Rarity says: "Working in a space this small would make me lose my mind!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Just like Maud's gonna lose her mind when she sees the gift I'm giving her!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whatever you were about to say isn't nearly as good as the gift I'm giving Maud!"
Maud Pie says: "You'll be pleased with yours too."
Rarity says: "Pinkie, put down that crayon!"
Rarity says: "The Cantering Cook isn't that kind of restaurant!"
Rarity says: "Oh..."
Rarity says: "A pony could get used to eating at places like this!"
Maud Pie says: "I know."
Maud Pie says: "It's the only restaurant in the city with nepheline syenite in their bathroom tiles."
Rarity says: "You know what, Pinkie Pie?"
Rarity says: "Uh, maybe you could help me figure out what to order!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We're so close to the pouch store!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's just a block away!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I could practically smell it from here!"
Pinkie Pie says: "If I knew what a pouch store smelled like."
Rarity says: "Okay, remember the plan."
Rarity says: "I will stay here and distract Maud while you go get a pouch!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Gotcha!"
Rarity says: "Oh, why, thank you for the kind assistance, Pinkie Pie."
Rarity says: "And now I know exactly what to order."
Pinkie Pie says: "You are very welcome, Rarity!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Now pardon me whilst I go wash my hooves!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Sorry!"
Rarity says: "So, Maud..."
Rarity says: "that Boulder of yours is such an interesting..."
Rarity says: "ahem..."
Rarity says: "character."
Rarity says: "You must tell me, how did the two of you first meet?"
Maud Pie says: "It was a dark and stormy night."
Maud Pie says: "Little did I know that my life was about to change forever."
Pinkie Pie says: "Look at that hand-stitched ten-thousand-thread-count velvet-lined rock pouch!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud will love it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I need it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ungh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Huh, must be stuck!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hello, Mr."
Pinkie Pie says: "Pouch Store Owner!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'd like to hear all about your sudden vacation in Canterlot with your grandniece while buying a pouch for my sister please!"
Deputy Copper says: "Miss, the store's clearly closed."
Pinkie Pie says: "But it can't be."
Pinkie Pie says: "It just can't be!"
Pinkie Pie says: "If I can't get that pouch..."
Pinkie Pie says: "then not only am I not getting my sister the greatest present in the history of PSSSD, but now I have no PSSSD present for my sister at all!"
Maud Pie says: "..."
Maud Pie says: "and Boulder's been by my side ever since."
Rarity says: "Oh, your hooves must be sparkling clean!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Huh?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, right."
Rarity says: "Garçon!"
Rarity says: "One super-deluxe two-mile-high hot fudge sundae, stat!"
Rarity says: "What happened?"
Rarity says: "Did you get a pouch for Maud?"
Rarity says: "Tell me everything!"
Rarity says: "Oh, not to worry, dear!"
Rarity says: "I'll just have to help you find a new present for Maud."
Rarity says: "We have plenty of time before your gift exchange at sunset and all of Manehattan to explore."
Rarity says: "We're bound to find something Maud would like."
Rarity says: "Maybe even more than a rock pouch!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You're right!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Thanks, Rarity!"
My Little Pony theme on piano interrupted by upwards glissando.
Rarity says: "Maud, I can't help but notice you're staring at that marvelous giraffe."
Rarity says: "I was just wondering, any chance you could see yourself with it?"
Maud Pie says: "Only if I had a mirror."
Rarity says: "Now, Maud, I know you're a big fan of rocks, so get your camera ready, because these are the most spectacular rocks in all of Manehattan!"
Rarity says: "Surely there must be something here that catches your eye."
Maud Pie says: "Boulder says they're all too..."
Maud Pie says: "stuck-up."
Western-themed music.
Maud Pie says: "I like..."
Maud Pie says: "that."
Rarity says: "What is it?"
Rarity says: "You have to tell me!"
Rarity says: "Was it this bike?"
Rarity says: "This lamp?"
Rarity says: "This grappling hook?"
Rarity says: "What do you like?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Maud Pie says: "I like that fissure in the sidewalk."
Maud Pie says: "It's an elegant example of thermal expansion and soil settlement."
Rarity says: "Fissure in thhhhhhhe soil..."
Rarity says: "?"
Rarity says: "What?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "But I..."
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "All of this..."
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "And she likes a crack?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Did she like anything?"
Rarity says: "That sister of yours is simply impossible to shop for!"
Rarity says: "There's nothing she needs or wants!"
Maud Pie says: "Boulder."
Maud Pie says: "Boulder."
Maud Pie says: "Where'd you run off to?"
Maud Pie says: "There you are."
Maud Pie says: "Sure wish I had something to carry you around in."
Pinkie Pie says: "A rock pouch was the perfect gift for Maud!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Aw, and I know she would have loved the one I saw in the window!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It had double stitching, a red drawstring..."
Rarity says: "..."
Rarity says: "and ochre-flecked velvet lining with reinforced triple-crosshatched seams?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yep, that's the pouch."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait, how'd you know?"
Rarity says: "Because I'm looking at one just like it!"
Rarity says: "Maybe if you can catch up with him, you could ask—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Excuse me, sir!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I couldn't help but notice your nifty rock pouch!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is there any chance you'd be willing to part with it?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I really need it."
Pinkie Pie says: "Like, really really really!"
"Street Rat" says: "So lemme get this straight: You, uh, really really need this pouch, huh?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I believe I said really really really."
"Street Rat" says: "Well, you know, pouches like this are really hard to come by these days."
"Street Rat" says: "But I might be able to part with it for the right price."
Pinkie Pie says: "So you'll sell it to me?"
Pinkie Pie says: "And I'll finally be able to give my sister the perfect Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day present?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
"Street Rat" says: "Hmmm."
"Street Rat" says: "That's one sweet party cannon you got there."
"Street Rat" says: "Tell you what."
"Street Rat" says: "I'd be more than happy to give you the pouch for the low, low price of..."
"Street Rat" says: "that cannon."
Pinkie Pie says: "M-My..."
Pinkie Pie says: "party cannon..."
Pinkie Pie says: "?"
"Street Rat" says: "Well, if you really wanna give that sister of yours the perfect present, then you'll have to give up your party cannon."
"Street Rat" says: "So, what do you say?"
"Street Rat" says: "The pouch for the cannon."
Maud Pie says: "Do you see the exposed chalcedony in the fissure?"
Rarity says: "Probably?"
Pinkie Pie says: "What you guys lookin' at?"
Rarity says: "Oh, you're back!"
Rarity says: "So, how did it go?"
Rarity says: "Tell me, tell me, tell me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, I got the rock pouch for Maud, and..."
Pinkie Pie says: "that's really the only thing that matters."
Rarity says: "Oh, I am so glad to hear that!"
Rarity says: "She's going to absolutely love it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yup."
Rarity says: ""Yup"?"
Rarity says: "That's it?"
Rarity says: "You got your sister the greatest PSSSD present in the history of ever, and all you have to say is "yup"?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yup."
Rarity says: "But..."
Rarity says: "you're Pinkie Pie."
Rarity says: "You're supposed to be all  Did you lose it?"
Rarity says: "Is your party cannon lost somewhere in the big city?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "I can clearly see that something's bothering you, and I want to help."
Rarity says: "But I can't help you unless you tell me what the problem is."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, there's no problem."
Pinkie Pie says: "It just turns out that the going rate for a rock pouch in Manehattan is one party cannon."
Pinkie Pie says: "Who knew?"
Rarity says: "You gave away your cannon?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "But, but that party cannon is your everything!"
Rarity says: "You absolutely love that cannon!"
Rarity says: "How could you possibly part with something that means so much to you?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, I finally got Maud a gift that's just as good as the ones she always gets me, and that's all that really matters."
Rarity says: "Well, I guess I understand..."
Rarity says: "maybe."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud's going to be so excited."
Pinkie Pie says: "I can't wait to see the look on her face when she sees the pouch!"
Maud Pie says: "I know, the camera loves Boulder."
Rarity says: "After the day we've had, I'm probably looking forward to the swap part of the Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day even more than the two of you!"
Rarity says: "And I'm not even a Pie sister!"
Rarity says: "I can't wait one more second to see the wonderful gifts you've gotten each other!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, you're going to have to."
Pinkie Pie says: "We don't just swap, silly."
Pinkie Pie says: "We always sing the Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day Song first!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ready, Maud?"
Maud Pie says: "As I'll ever be."
Pinkie Pie.
It's the Pie Sisters' Swap Day Sooooooong!
Maud Pie says: "Hey."
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay, time to swap presents!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hmmmm."
Rarity says: "Just open them already!"
Maud Pie says: "Thanks."
Pinkie Pie says: "I knew you'd love it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It was all worth it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Look how happy she is!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And I couldn't have done it without you."
Pinkie Pie says: "Thank you, Rarity."
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Time to open your present to me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You did it again!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You got me the best present in the history of PSSSD!"
Pinkie Pie says: "This is perfect!"
Pinkie Pie says: "This is amazing!"
Pinkie Pie says: "This is incredible!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I love it, I love it, I love it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What is it?"
Maud Pie says: "It's little pieces of cupcake-scented paper."
Maud Pie says: "You know, confetti."
Maud Pie says: "For your cannon."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud..."
Rarity says: "You're right, that is impressive."
Rarity says: "But it's no fissure in the sidewalk."
Maud Pie says: "Play nice."
Rarity says: "Oh, I'm so relieved to see that you like the pouch."
Rarity says: "Especially considering what Pinkie Pie had to give up for it."
Rarity says: "Oh!"
Maud Pie says: "What?"
Rarity says: "I mean..."
Rarity says: "forget I said that!"
Rarity says: "I'm, I-I-I'm glad to see that you like the pouch."
Rarity says: "You can remember that part."
Rarity says: "Just forget the second part."
Rarity says: "You know, the second part where I said that Pinkie Pie had to give something up—"
Rarity says: "Perhaps I should just stop talking now."
Rarity says: "Nothing!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hee-hee, yay!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I love my sister and my new confetti!"
Maud Pie says: "Why isn't she using her party cannon?"
Rarity says: "Gahhhh..."
Rarity says: "Ooh!"
Rarity says: "Wow, look how filthy my hooves are!"
Rarity says: "I really should go wash them!"
Maud Pie says: "Where's her cannon?"
Rarity says: "No, no, stop, stop giving me that look!"
Rarity says: "I can't take it!"
Rarity says: "Nnnnn..."
Rarity says: "Pinkie Pie feels bad that the gifts that she always gives you are never as good as the ones that you give her!"
Maud Pie says: "What?"
Rarity says: "That's why she was willing to give up the party cannon for the pouch!"
Maud Pie says: "She gave up her party cannon?"
Rarity says: "Pinkie Pie!"
Rarity says: "You might want to come over here for a second!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I think I know what this is about."
Pinkie Pie says: "You guys wanna ride the swans."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, there are swan boats, but there are real swans here we can ri—"
Maud Pie says: "You gave away your party cannon?"
Rarity says: "She broke me."
Pinkie Pie says: "Nnngh, it's just..."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's just..."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's just..."
Pinkie Pie says: "You always give better gifts than me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's why I had to get you the perfect gift!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Are your hooves dirty?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Where're you going?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Maud Pie says: "To get your cannon back."
Maud Pie says: "There."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yep!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That sure is the pony I got the pouch from!"
Rarity says: "That's amazing!"
Rarity says: "How did you know where he'd be?"
Maud Pie says: "Maud Sense."
Pinkie Pie says: "Runs in the family!"
Maud Pie says: "I'd like to return this pouch for my sister's party cannon, please."
"Street Rat" says: "Sorry, missy, all sales are final."
Maud Pie says: "I'd like to return this pouch for my sister's party cannon, please."
Rarity says: "Ooh, I've never seen her like this!"
Rarity says: "Look at the fire in her eyes!"
Rarity says: "You'd better do what she says!"
"Street Rat" says: "Fire in her eyes?"
Rarity says: "Oh!"
Rarity says: "Did she just clench her jaw?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "I think she clenched her jaw!"
"Street Rat" says: "I didn't see."
Rarity says: "Oh, no!"
Rarity says: "When she clenches her jaw..."
Rarity says: "you know what that means?!"
Rarity says: "!"
"Street Rat" says: "What?"
"Street Rat" says: "What's it mean?"
Rarity says: "Trust me, you do not want to know!"
Maud Pie says: "I'd like to return this pouch."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm so happy you got me my party cannon back!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yay!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh-oh."
Pinkie Pie says: "I just realized something."
Pinkie Pie says: "'Cause you gave back the pouch for my cannon, this is now the second gift you've gotten me today!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And it's something I really, really wanted!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You did it again!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Your gifts are always better than mine!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Next year, I'm gonna have to really step it up and—"
Maud Pie says: "Pinkie, gift giving isn't a competition."
Maud Pie says: "It's an expression of love, and you always make sure to give your gifts with lots of love."
Maud Pie says: "That's why I'll always love them, and you, five-ever."
Maud Pie says: "That's even longer than for-ever."
Pinkie Pie says: "Awwww!"
Pinkie Pie says: "There you are!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You've sure been washing your hooves for a long time!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We've got a train to catch here!"
Rarity says: "I know, but there is one more sight you two simply must see before we leave."
Rarity says: "Voila!"
Rarity says: "Welcome to the future home of "Rarity For You"!"
Rarity says: "What do you think of the place?"
Rarity says: "Is this the right location?"
Rarity says: "Did I pick a good spot?"
Maud Pie says: "No."
Maud Pie says: "You picked the perfect spot."
Pinkie Pie says: "You know, I think this might be my favorite PSSSD ever!"
Pinkie Pie says: "But I can't wait 'til next year's PSSS-D-W-R!"
Rarity says: "Wait."
Rarity says: "PSSS-D-W-R?"
Rarity says: "What's that?"
Pinkie Pie says: "P-S-S-S-D-W-R!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's a new tradition that Maud and I came up with!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day..."
Maud Pie says: "With Rarity."
Rarity says: "Oh!"
Rarity says: "Ohhh!"
Rarity says: "Why, that's the sweetest..."
Rarity says: "Oh, no."
Rarity says: "Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no."
Rarity says: "I know how good you two are at giving gifts!"
Rarity says: "I'm going to have to get you both something amazing, and I only have a year to do it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, Rarity!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It doesn't matter what you get us!"
Pinkie Pie says: "As long as you give your gift with love, it'll be perfect!"
Rarity says: "Why, thank you, Pinkie."
Pinkie Pie says: "Buuuut now that you mention it..."
Pinkie Pie says: "I could use more confetti for my party cannon."
Pinkie Pie says: "You wouldn't believe how much of that stuff I go through in a day!"
