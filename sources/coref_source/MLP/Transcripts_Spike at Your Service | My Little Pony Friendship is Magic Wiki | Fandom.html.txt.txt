Spike says: "Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Huh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's not that many."
Spike says: "Are you kidding?"
Spike says: "How are you supposed to read twelve books in one weekend?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Princess Celestia obviously thinks I can or she would never have assigned them to me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm not planning on letting her down."
Spike says: "Well, I hope you're not planning on sleeping then, either."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Actually, Spike, why don't you take the day off?"
Spike says: "Really?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why not?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "These books are gonna keep me busy for a while."
Spike says: "Hmm..."
Spike says: "I do have a long list of things I've been dying to do!"
Spike says: ""Touch nose with tongue."
Spike says: "" Eeeng..."
Spike says: "done!"
Spike says: ""Play bongos on my belly."
Spike says: "Done!"
Spike says: ""Smell my dirty feet."
Spike says: ""  Done!"
Spike says: "Huh, that didn't take nearly as long as I thought it would."
Spike says: "What to do, what to do..."
Spike says: "A hot air balloon ride!"
Spike says: "Oh no!"
Spike says: "Wait!"
Spike says: "Runaway balloon!"
Spike says: "Gah!"
Spike says: "Sorry!"
Spike says: "That was a close one."
Spike says: "I-if I didn't know better, I would swear that I was in the middle of the dark and scary Everfree Forest."
Applejack says: "Come 'n' get me, ya big goons!"
Applejack says: "Run!"
Spike says: "I'm running!"
Spike says: "I'm running!"
Applejack says: "Whew!"
Spike says: "Wow, Applejack!"
Spike says: "That was amazing!"
Spike says: "I mean, you rocketed those boulders at them like they were..."
Spike says: "rockets!"
Spike says: "Pow, pow, pow pow pow!"
Spike says: "You saved my life!"
Spike says: "You..."
Spike says: "saved..."
Spike says: "my life."
Applejack says: "Aw, don't mention it, Spike."
Applejack says: "C'mon, we should be headin' on back, now."
Spike says: "Man, am I lucky you were out here."
Spike says: "Uh, why were you out here?"
Applejack says: "Saw the balloon floatin' by with nopony in it, came out here to investigate."
Applejack says: "Guess you did too, huh?"
Spike says: "Uh..."
Spike says: "yeah..."
Spike says: "I was investigating the runaway hot air balloon too!"
Spike says: "So, uh, now that the mystery's been solved, let's get outta here, huh?"
Applejack says: "Thanks for walkin' me home, Spike."
Applejack says: "That was mighty kind of you."
Applejack says: "But now I have chores that need tendin' to, so see you later."
Spike says: "What chores?"
Spike says: "I'll do them!"
Spike says: "It's the least I can do!"
Spike says: "You saved my life!"
Spike says: "I need to repay the favor."
Applejack says: "Shoot, Spike, that's what friends do for each other."
Applejack says: "You don't need to repay the favor."
Spike says: "Yes, I do!"
Applejack says: "Sugar, it's okay, it's not necessary."
Spike says: "Applejack, you don't understand!"
Spike says: "This is something I really need to do!"
Applejack says: "Well, I'd hate to get in the way of doin' somethin' you need to do..."
Spike says: "Great!"
Spike says: "What should I do?"
Applejack says: "Uh..."
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom's over yonder givin' little Piggington a bath."
Applejack says: "I was gonna lend her a hoof, but maybe you could lend her one instead."
Spike says: "On the double!"
Spike says: "Applejack said I could help you!"
Apple Bloom says: "Great!"
Apple Bloom says: "I could use all the help I can get!"
Spike says: "Heh, wait 'til Applejack sees how you sparkle!"
Spike says: "Ta-da!"
Applejack says: "Good job, you two."
Apple Bloom says: "Applejack, is it okay if I get goin'?"
Apple Bloom says: "I don't wanna be late for my Crusaders meeting."
Apple Bloom says: "We're gettin' fitted for water skis!"
Applejack says: "Heh, you definitely don't wanna be late for that."
Apple Bloom says: "Water skiin' cutie mark, here I come!"
Applejack says: "Spike, you can head on out too."
Applejack says: "I reckon you have repaid me in full so we are officially even Steven."
Spike says: "What?"
Spike says: "Ohhh no."
Spike says: "We aren't even close to being even Steven!"
Spike says: "Please, Applejack, you must allow me to assist you further!"
Applejack says: "I dunno, Spike."
Applejack says: "Just don't feel right to have you, uh, doin' things for me."
Spike says: "Please?"
Spike says: "Pretty please?"
Spike says: "Pretty pretty pretty please?"
Applejack says: "Oh, all right."
Spike says: "Pies!"
Spike says: "Pies!"
Spike says: "I'm helping Applejack make some pies!"
Granny Smith says: "Uh, Spike, little feller, could you get us some more eggs?"
Spike says: "Coming right up!"
Spike says: "Uh, oops, sorry, Applejack."
Spike says: "Lemme get something to clean that up!"
Applejack says: "Appreciate all your help today, sugarcube, but..."
Applejack says: "I can take it from here."
Spike says: "Don't be ridiculous!"
Spike says: "It is my honor and my duty!"
Spike says: "Today's just the beginning!"
Applejack says: "What's that now?"
Spike says: "You saved my life!"
Spike says: "According to the "Spike the Dragon Code", I owe you a life debt and must serve you."
Granny Smith says: "Now, what about Twilight?"
Granny Smith says: "Doesn't she need your help and such?"
Spike says: "Huh, you're right."
Spike says: "I better break the news to Twilight."
Spike says: "I just hope she doesn't take it too hard..."
Spike says: "Be right back!"
Spike says: "Come on, Spike, this is your personal, moral, ethical dragon code we're talking about!"
Spike says: "You have to do this!"
Spike says: "It's not like you and Twilight won't be friends anymore..."
Spike says: "but it won't be the same..."
Spike says: "but it has to be done."
Spike says: "Twilight, Applejack just saved my life from horrible, dragon-eating timberwolves!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Mm-hmm..."
Spike says: "And, as you are aware, I adhere to my dragon code, and this means I must serve her for the rest of my natural born days!"
Spike says: "I'm sure you understand."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Mm-hmm..."
Spike says: "It's..."
Spike says: "been an honor..."
Spike says: "being your faithful assistant."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sounds good."
Spike says: "She said it was okay."
Applejack says: "Really?"
Granny Smith says: "Really?"
Spike says: "Well, until forever!"
Applejack says: "Listen, sugarcube, I completely respect your "dragon code"..."
Applejack says: "Truly I do, but I just can't cotton with you permanently servin' me."
Spike says: "Please, Applejack, my dragon code is a part of me!"
Spike says: "I have to be true to myself!"
Spike says: "If you don't let me do this, I won't be a noble dragon anymore!"
Applejack says: "Oh, well, I can't have you feelin' like you're not a noble dragon now, can I?"
Spike says: "Great!"
Spike says: "Then from here on in, your wish is my command."
Applejack says: "Oh, uh, okay..."
Applejack says: "I would like you to..."
Applejack says: "hmm..."
Applejack says: "huh..."
Applejack says: "oh!"
Applejack says: "..."
Applejack says: "Help me take some of the pie you made to..."
Spike says: "Rarity?"
Applejack says: "Uh, sure, why not?"
Spike says: "I helped bake it."
Rarity says: "Eugh."
Spike says: "You even look good when you're chewing..."
Spike says: "W-who looks good when they're chewing?"
Spike says: "Aren't you gonna have some more?"
Rarity says: "I..."
Rarity says: "had a big lunch!"
Spike says: "It's ten in the morning."
Rarity says: "Breakfast."
Rarity says: "A big breakfast."
Spike says: "Ohhh."
Spike says: "Okay."
Applejack says: "Maybe you could take her plate back to the kitchen and wash it off?"
Spike says: "As you wish!"
Rarity says: "What was that all about?"
Applejack says: "I saved Spike from some timberwolves in the Everfree Forest, and now he thinks he has to serve me forever."
Rarity says: "Oh, what I wouldn't give to have somepony forever in my debt!"
Applejack says: "Okay, I get it, havin' somepony to do things for you would be a dream come true."
Applejack says: "But I don't feel right havin' Spike thinkin' he owes me somethin'."
Applejack says: "And you tasted that pie."
Applejack says: "Sometimes, his help isn't that helpful."
Spike says: "Do you..."
Spike says: "have a broom I could borrow?"
Rainbow Dash says: "AJ, Rarity, what's happening?"
Rarity says: "Applejack saved Spike's life and now he has to serve her forever."
Rainbow Dash says: "Sweet!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What are you having him do?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wash your laundry?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Clean your room?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Help you with your unfinished novel?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Mine's about this awesome Pegasus who's the best flyer ever and becomes the captain of the Wonderbolts!"
Rarity says: "How ever did you come up with that ingeniously woven intricate plot line?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Just came to me."
Applejack says: "Thing is, I don't really want him to serve me forever, but I don't know how to get him to stop."
Rainbow Dash says: "That's easy!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Just make him help you with something really, really hard."
Applejack says: "I dunno."
Applejack says: "I don't want him to get hurt."
Rainbow Dash says: "Puh-lease."
Rainbow Dash says: "He'll quit way before there's even a chance of getting hurt!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Sooo, Spike, Applejack was gonna help me stack some hay so I could practice smashing through it, but I'm feeling extra, extra powerful today."
Applejack says: "You are?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, I am."
Rainbow Dash says: "So instead of hay, I'm gonna smash through rocks!"
Spike says: "Rocks?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "A huge tower of rocks!"
Rainbow Dash says: "And you're gonna build it!"
Spike says: "I am?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, I mean, unless you don't wanna help Applejack..."
Spike says: "I do!"
Spike says: "It is Spike's dragon code!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Then get to it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Trust me."
Rainbow Dash says: "This is gonna work like a charm!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh."
Rainbow Dash says: "I was sure he'd give up after, like, three rocks."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, goodness."
Fluttershy says: "If it'd been me, I'd have just pretended I didn't have anything for him to do."
Applejack says: "Why didn't I think of that?"
Spike says: "Is this high enough?"
Applejack says: "That's plenty high!"
Applejack says: "Come on down, Spike!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Bad news: He actually ended up building the whole rock tower."
Rainbow Dash says: "Good news..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I've got a rock tower to knock down."
Spike says: "Haha, yeah!"
Spike says: "You can do it!"
Spike says: "Haha, hahah, alright, yeah!"
Spike says: "That..."
Spike says: "was..."
Spike says: "awesome!"
Spike says: "Wanna do it again, Rainbow Dash?"
Spike says: "Applejack can rebuild it for you."
Spike says: "And when I say "Applejack", I of course mean me!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Sure!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Why not..."
Rainbow Dash says: "?"
Applejack says: "No!"
Applejack says: "I mean, I don't think Rainbow Dash needs any more of your help."
Applejack says: "My help."
Applejack says: "She doesn't need it."
Applejack says: "Right, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Bbbbrrr."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah."
Rainbow Dash says: "I guess I'm good."
Rainbow Dash says: "For now."
Applejack says: "And so am I!"
Applejack says: "I just can't think of one more thing I need help with, so you don't have to do anything else."
Spike says: "W-What do you mean you can't think of anything else I can help with?"
Applejack says: "Exactly that!"
Applejack says: "There's nothin' else."
Applejack says: "I don't want you to do anything."
Spike says: "If I don't help you, how will I know I'm a noble dragon?"
Spike says: "Maybe there's things you need help with, but you don't even realize you need help with!"
Fluttershy says: "If she needed help, I think she'd realize it."
Spike says: "Maybe not!"
Spike says: "Maybe Applejack needs help realizing what she needs help with."
Spike says: "Like..."
Spike says: "maybe your back itches!"
Applejack says: "Huuuuh..."
Applejack says: "that does feel..."
Applejack says: "good..."
Spike says: "See?"
Spike says: "Or you might need help remembering your favorite song!"
Spike says: ""The dragon is the finest creature ever, there's more to him than just guarding treasure..."
Spike says: "Or..."
Spike says: "you might need help breathing!"
Applejack says: "Breathin'?"
Spike says: "See?"
Spike says: "There are plenty of things I can help you with, and you don't even have to trouble yourself with thinking of them!"
Applejack says: "No, I'll think of 'em."
Applejack says: "Lemme think of 'em."
Spike says: "As you wish."
Applejack says: "Twilight?"
Applejack says: "Twilight, are you there?"
Applejack says: "Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Agh!"
Applejack says: "Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, it's okay, I need to take a break anyway."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's going on?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wait, what?"
Applejack says: "He said he told you all about it."
Applejack says: "I'm guessin' maybe you were a little distracted when he told you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Um, maybe a little..."
Applejack says: "I should've realized you wouldn't have let him go so easily."
Applejack says: "Well, now that you know what's goin' on, maybe you could talk some sense into him!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Applejack, I wish I could, but this is dragon code we're talking about."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Surely you know how important the dragon code is to a dragon!"
Applejack says: "I sure am startin' to."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hm, there's only one other way Spike is gonna fulfill the debt he feels he owes you."
Spike says: "Seventy, seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three, seventy-four, seventy-five..."
Applejack says: "All right, y'all, here's the deal."
Applejack says: "Spike needs to save my life."
Pinkie Pie says: "And you want us to shoot you out of a cannon towards a hornet's nest and give Spike a butterfly net so he can catch you mere seconds before you hit the nest and are stung by a thousand angry hornets!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'll wear this mustache."
Applejack says: "No."
Applejack says: "I am gonna be attacked by a timberwolf!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Can I still wear the mustache?"
Applejack says: "When I give the signal, Pinkie Pie and Rarity will come runnin' out of the woods, bein' pursued by the timberwolf."
Applejack says: "I'll start to run too, but then pretend to get my hoof stuck."
Applejack says: "I'll ask Spike to help me dislodge it, and he will, and I'll be able to get away from the terrifyin' timberwolf!"
Applejack says: "Havin' saved me from certain doom, Spike will then consider us even."
Applejack says: "Everybody get it?"
Fluttershy says: "Uh-huh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh-huh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll do my best."
Rarity says: "Mm-hmm."
Pinkie Pie says: "Just one question."
Applejack says: "Yes?"
Applejack says: "No."
Pinkie Pie says: "Suit yourself."
Rarity says: "We are all ready to play our parts, ahem, but are you sure you are ready to play yours, Applejack?"
Applejack says: "What d'you mean?"
Rarity says: "Show us your best "damsel in distress" move."
Applejack says: "Uh..."
Applejack says: "Oh, well, aheh, how's this?"
Applejack says: "Hooooooo."
Rarity says: "Absolutely horrendous!"
Rarity says: "Okay, this needs some serious work!"
Spike says: "Applejack?"
Applejack says: "No time!"
Applejack says: "Here he comes!"
Applejack says: "Uh..."
Applejack says: "over here, Spike!"
Spike says: "You said you had something else you needed me to do?"
Spike says: "But of course."
Spike says: "Oh, by the way, there are exactly twenty-four million, five hundred and sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred and thirty seven blades of grass at Sweet Apple Acres."
Applejack says: "I can't believe you counted every single one of 'em..."
Spike says: "You asked me to."
Fluttershy says: "That was very convincing!"
Rarity says: "We are doomed!"
Rarity says: "See?"
Rarity says: "Like that."
Applejack says: "Oh no!"
Applejack says: "I seem to have got my hoof caught in between two rocks!"
Applejack says: "I cannot run away!"
Applejack says: "I am a damsel in distress!"
Applejack says: "Help me, Spike!"
Spike says: "Wait a minute."
Applejack says: "No, no, don't wait a minute."
Applejack says: "Save me from the terrifyin' timberwolf!"
Spike says: "Well, he would be terrifying if he wasn't a fake!"
Spike says: "You got the clomping on his claws..."
Spike says: "..."
Spike says: "The roar was spot on, and the detail on his face is pretty good."
Spike says: "But you forgot one thing: his breath!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Timberwolf!"
Spike says: "Timberwolf!"
Applejack says: "Whooooah!"
Applejack says: "Ow!"
Spike says: "Uh oh..."
Spike says: "Applejack, come on!"
Applejack says: "I can't!"
Applejack says: "I'm really stuck!"
Spike says: "No more messing around!"
Spike says: "Let's go!"
Applejack says: "Come on..."
Applejack says: "Forget it, Spike!"
Applejack says: "You gotta get out of here!"
Applejack says: "Would you just forget your dragon code already and go?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Spike says: "No!"
Spike says: "I have to save you!"
Spike says: "Let's get out of here!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What happened to you guys back there?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thought you were right behind us!"
Applejack says: "My hoof was stuck, and that timberwolf was coming right at me!"
Rarity says: "Wait, you were actually stuck?"
Spike says: "Uh-huh!"
Applejack says: "But Spike picked up a pebble, and rocketed that thing right at the huge timberwolf's mouth, and saved my life!"
Spike says: "Aw, it was nothing."
Applejack says: "It was somethin' alright!"
Applejack says: "'Course, I wouldn't've needed help if I hadn't been tryin' to stage a fake timberwolf attack in the first place."
Spike says: "Yeah, what was that all about?"
Applejack says: "I know this code thing's important to you, but if somethin' like this comes up in the future, think maybe we can go back to my code, say "that's what friends do" and leave it at that?"
Applejack says: "I promise I won't think of you as any less noble."
Spike says: "Sounds good to me."
Spike says: "But, maybe let's just try to avoid situations where one of us actually needs the other one to save their life?"
Applejack says: "You got yourself a deal."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thanks, Spike."
Spike says: "Happy to help!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Don't know what I'd do without you."
Spike says: "No, really!"
Spike says: "I'm really really really happy to help you!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh..."
