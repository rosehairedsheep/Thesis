Pinkie Pie says: "Hoof-biting action overload!"
Pinkie Pie says: "She was like a stunt superstar, flying higher and higher, and then Rainbow Dash swooped down—"
Pinkie Pie says: "swoosh—"
Pinkie Pie says: "and right before she hit the ground—"
Pinkie Pie says: "shoom, she pulled up—"
Pinkie Pie says: "vrrrmmm!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh-huh."
Pinkie Pie says: "And then she looped around and around like whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh-huh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Phew."
Pinkie Pie says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie Pie?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Not again."
Pinkie Pie says: "Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash says: "Not now, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie says: "But, but Rainbow Dash—"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm in the middle of something."
Rainbow Dash says: "I said not now—"
Pinkie Pie says: "I was gonna tell you to look out for that mountain."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hi, I'm looking for Rainbow Dash."
Pinkie Pie says: "Have you seen her?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hi there, have you seen Rainbow Dash?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay, thanks anyway."
Pinkie Pie says: "Twilight, have you seen Rainbow Dash anywhere?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Isn't she right up there?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Phew."
Rainbow Dash says: "That was close."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hi!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Aah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hi again."
Rainbow Dash says: "Aah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I need a favor, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash says: "Waaa—"
Rainbow Dash says: "oh, forget it."
Pinkie Pie says: "I totally promise it'll be totally fun."
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "Over to the right."
Pinkie Pie says: "No no, a little to the left."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh wait, back to the right."
Pinkie Pie says: "Now a little leftish while staying rightly."
Pinkie Pie says: "Stop."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hmm."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maybe a few inches to the south."
Pinkie Pie says: "Now a couple centimeters north."
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "One more smidgimeter to the—"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie Pie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, I mean, perfect."
Pinkie Pie says: "Now wait for my signal."
Spike says: "D-aah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh Rainbow Dash, we startled Spike into getting the hiccups."
Spike says: "Nnaa—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh no, you're not hurt are you?"
Spike says: "Ne—"
Spike says: "fire-proof."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, okay, good."
Spike says: "I wish the same thing  were true with scrolls."
Pinkie Pie says: "Have you ever seen anything more hilarious?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I can think of one thing."
Pinkie Pie says: "Aah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I didn't take you for a prankster, Pinkie Pie."
Rainbow Dash says: "You know Pinkie Pie, you're not as annoying as I thought."
Rainbow Dash says: "You wanna hang out?"
Rainbow Dash says: "A simple nod would do."
Pinkie Pie says: "Mmm-hmm."
Rainbow Dash says: "Is she even home?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I don't know."
Pinkie Pie says: "This is gonna be gold!"
Rainbow Dash says: "There she is!"
Rarity says: "Ooo."
Pinkie Pie says: "Aaa-choo!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hmm?"
Applejack says: "Land sakes!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is someone over there?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Who're we gonna squirt?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Who're we gonna squirt?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Fluttershy."
Pinkie Pie says: "WHAT?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Nononononono, we can't prank Fluttershy, I mean, she's so sensitive."
Pinkie Pie says: "It'll hurt her feelings, even our most harmless prank."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, you're right."
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh."
Rainbow Dash says: "We need another victim who's made of tougher stuff."
Rainbow Dash says: "So, who's it gonna be?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh,  The toughest around."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, awesome."
Rainbow Dash says: "Who?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Who?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Do I know them?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You're very close."
Rainbow Dash says: "Good one, Pinkie Pie."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ridiculous."
Pinkie Pie says: "Rise and shine Rainbow Dash!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's a brand new day and we got a lot of pranking to—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Mornin', Pinks."
Rainbow Dash says: "Gilda, this is my gal pal, Pinkie Pie."
Gilda says: "Hey."
Gilda says: "What's up?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie, this is my griffon friend, Gilda."
Pinkie Pie says: "What's a griffon?"
Rainbow Dash says: "She's half-eagle, half-lion."
Gilda says: "And all awesome."
Gilda says: "Raa."
Gilda says: "Heh-haa."
Gilda says: "Yeah, that's right."
Rainbow Dash says: "Gilda's my best friend from my days at Junior Speedster flight camp."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, remember the chant?"
Gilda says: "Sha, they made us recite it every morning, I'll never get that lame thing out of my head."
Rainbow Dash says: "Sooo..."
Gilda says: "Ugh."
Gilda says: "Only for you, Dash."
Rainbow Dash and Gilda.
Junior Speedsters are our lives,.
Sky-bound soars and daring dives.
Junior Speedsters, it's our quest,.
To someday be the very best!
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh that was awesome, and it gave me a great idea for a prank."
Pinkie Pie says: "Gilda, you game?"
Gilda says: "Huh."
Gilda says: "Well, I groove on a good prank as much as the next griffon."
Gilda says: "But Dash, you promised me we'd get a flying session in this morning."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, uh, well, Pinkie Pie, you don't mind, do you?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Gilda just got here."
Rainbow Dash says: "We'll catch up with you later."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh."
Pinkie Pie says: "Um, well sure, no problem."
Pinkie Pie says: "Have fun you guys, I'll, uh, just catch up with you—"
Gilda says: "Whoa, that was sweet."
Gilda says: "Just like old times."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, only faster."
Rainbow Dash says: "So now what?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey there."
Gilda says: "Huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh?"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's later."
Pinkie Pie says: "And I caught up."
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie Pie, you are so random."
Gilda says: "Hey Dash, think you got enough gas left to beat me to that cloud?"
Rainbow Dash says: "A race?"
Rainbow Dash says: "You are so on."
Gilda says: "One, two, three, go."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I win."
Gilda says: "As if."
Gilda says: "I won, dude."
Rainbow Dash says: "No way."
Gilda says: "Yes way."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, come on, I was way ahead of you."
Gilda says: "Uh, I don't think so."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh Geez, dream on."
Gilda says: "Remember back in camp?"
Rainbow Dash says: "There is no way you beat me."
Gilda says: "Whatever."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wow guys, that was really close, but I think Rainbow Dash beat you by a teeny weeny itty bitty hair, or a teeny weeny itty bitty feather."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hah, see?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Good thing Pinkie Pie's here to keep you honest, G."
Gilda says: "Okay..."
Gilda says: "Dash, last one to that cloud up there is a gnarly dragon egg."
Gilda says: "Go!"
Gilda says: "I think the high altitude is making you dizzy."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait, guys!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh wow, you guys almost got away from me that time."
Gilda says: "So, Dash, got any new moves in your tricktionary, or are you 100% old school?"
Rainbow Dash says: "New moves?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh, sit back G, this is gonna take a while."
Gilda says: "Hey Pinkie, c'mere."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah?"
Gilda says: "Don't you know how to take get lost for an answer?"
Gilda says: "Dash doesn't need to hang with a dweeb like you now that I'm around."
Gilda says: "You're dorkin' up the skies, Stinkie Pie, so make like a bee and BUZZ OFF."
Rainbow Dash says: "Try matching that."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, where's Pinkie Pie and her crazy contraption?"
Gilda says: "Eh, she left."
Gilda says: "Something about being as busy as a bee."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hmph!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "So Pinkie Pie, are you sure that this friend of Rainbow Dash is really so mean?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Um, yeah."
Pinkie Pie says: "She keeps stealing Rainbow Dash away, she pops my balloons, and she told me to buzz off."
Pinkie Pie says: "I've never met a griffon this mean."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, actually, I've never met a griffon at all, but I bet if I had, she wouldn't have been as mean and grumpy as Gilda."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You know what I think, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hmm?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, I think..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "you're jealous."
Pinkie Pie says: "Jealous?"
Spike says: "Green with envy."
Spike says: "Well, in your case, pink with envy."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, yes."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Jealous."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Listen Pinkie, I don't want to upset you, but just because Rainbow Dash has another friend doesn't make Gilda a grump."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I mean, perhaps it's you, Pinkie, who needs to improve her attitude."
Pinkie Pie says: "Improve my attitude?"
Pinkie Pie says: "But I..."
Pinkie Pie says: "d..."
Pinkie Pie says: "b.."
Pinkie Pie says: "it's Gilda that..."
Pinkie Pie says: "d..."
Pinkie Pie says: "are you seri..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maybe Twilight is right."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maybe Gilda isn't a big meanie grumpy mean-meanie-pants."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maybe I'm just a big jealous judgmental jealous-jealousy-pants."
Rainbow Dash says: "That was sweet."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh, I gotta take care of a few weather jobs around here."
Rainbow Dash says: "Shouldn't take long."
Rainbow Dash says: "Just, uh, hang out in town and I'll come find ya."
Gilda says: "That's cool, I guess."
Gilda says: "I'm gonna go chow down."
Rainbow Dash says: "Later."
Granny Smith says: "Aaah!"
Granny Smith says: "A rattler, a rattler!"
Granny Smith says: "Run for the hills!"
Granny Smith says: "Everybody forsake yourselves!"
Gilda says: "This stuff ain't fresh, dude."
Pinkie Pie says: "Aw, poor Granny Smith, she didn't know it was a joke!"
Pinkie Pie says: "How mean!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No, no, I can't misjudge her."
Pinkie Pie says: "It was kind of a funny prank, I guess."
Pinkie Pie says: "I did misjudge her!"
Pinkie Pie says: "She's not only a meanie mean-pants, she's also a thief!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Nonononono, she might give it back."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's just a joke."
Fluttershy says: "All right little ones, this way, this way."
Fluttershy says: "Mama duck, you're free and clear."
Gilda says: "Hey."
Fluttershy says: "Please excuse me."
Gilda says: "I'm walkin' here."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, um, I'm sorry."
Fluttershy says: "I-I-I was just trying to..."
Gilda says: "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
Gilda says: "Why don't you just watch where you're going, doofus?"
Fluttershy says: "B-b-b-but I..."
Fluttershy says: "I..."
Gilda says: "Ugh, please, all these lame ponies are driving me buggy."
Gilda says: "I gotta bail."
Pinkie Pie says: "She's a grump, and a thief, and a bully!"
Pinkie Pie says: "The meanest kind of mean meanie-pants there is!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I can take it, but no one treats Fluttershy like that."
Pinkie Pie says: "No."
Pinkie Pie says: "One."
Pinkie Pie says: "This calls for extreme measures, Pinkie Pie style!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Welcome, welcome."
Pinkie Pie says: "Welcome!"
Applejack says: "Who's this Gilda I've heard nothing about?"
Rarity says: "I hear she's an old friend of Rainbow Dash."
Rarity says: "A griffon, so rare."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You've met Gilda, right?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's she like?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, um, well, I'll tell you later, Twilight."
Pinkie Pie says: "Welcome."
Pinkie Pie says: "Welcome."
Fluttershy says: "Um, Pinkie Pie, about this party for Gilda."
Fluttershy says: "Umm..."
Fluttershy says: "do you really think it's a good idea?"
Fluttershy says: "I mean—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't worry your pretty little head about mean old Gilda."
Pinkie Pie says: "Your auntie Pinkie Pie's got it all taken care of."
Fluttershy says: "I'm a year older than you."
Pinkie Pie says: "Gilda!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm so honored to throw you one of my signature Pinkie Pie parties, and I really, truly, sincerely, hope you feel welcome here amongst all us pony folk."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh Pinkie Pie, the old hoof-shake buzzer."
Rainbow Dash says: "You are a scream."
Gilda says: "Yeah  uh, good one, Pinkie Pie."
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on G, I'll introduce you to some of my other friends."
Gilda says: "Right behind you, Dash!"
Gilda says: "I know what you're up to."
Pinkie Pie says: "Great."
Gilda says: "Rrrh."
Gilda says: "I know what you're planning."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, I hope so."
Pinkie Pie says: "This wasn't supposed to be a surprise party."
Gilda says: "I mean, I've got my eye on you."
Pinkie Pie says: "And I got my eye on you."
Pinkie Pie says: "Everyone, I'd like you all to meet Gilda, a long-time, dear friend of Rainbow Dash."
Pinkie Pie says: "Let's honor her and welcome her to Ponyville."
Pinkie Pie says: "Please help yourself."
Gilda says: "Vanilla lemon drops."
Gilda says: "Don't mind if I do."
Gilda says: "HOT!"
Rainbow Dash says: "G, the punch!"
Gilda says: "Huh?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, whaddya know, pepper in the vanilla lemon drops, and the punch served in a dribble glass!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ha!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Priceless, priceless!"
Gilda says: "Yeah, hilarious."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey G, look!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Presents!"
Applejack says: "Spittin' snakes."
Applejack says: "Hah, somepony pulled that prank on me last month."
Gilda says: "Ha ha."
Gilda says: "I bet I know who that was."
Pinkie Pie says: "You do?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Cake time, everypony!"
Spike says: "Hey, can I blow out the candles?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why don't we let Gilda blow out the candles, Spike?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "She is the guest of honor after all."
Gilda says: "Exactly."
Spike says: "Re-lighting birthday candles, I love that prank!"
Spike says: "What a classic."
Pinkie Pie says: "Now, I wonder who could've done that."
Gilda says: "Yeah, I wonder."
Spike says: "Mmm, who cares."
Spike says: "This cake is amazing."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike."
Spike says: "What?"
Spike says: "It's great, try some."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey G, you're not upset about some silly candles, are you?"
Gilda says: "No way, Dash."
Gilda says: "Like I said, I'm down with a good prank."
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on then, let's have some cake."
Gilda says: "Hey, I'm watching you."
Gilda says: "Like a hawk."
Pinkie Pie says: "Why?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Can't you watch me like a griffon?"
Applejack says: "Hey y'all, it's pin the tail on the pony."
Applejack says: "Let's play."
Rarity says: "Oh, my favorite game."
Rarity says: "Can I go first?"
Rarity says: "Can I have the purple tail?"
Gilda says: "Well, I am the guest of honor, and I'll have the purple tail."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah, Gilda should definitely go first."
Pinkie Pie says: "Let's get you blindfolded."
Gilda says: "Hey what—"
Gilda says: "ugh—"
Gilda says: "what are you doing?"
Gilda says: "Rrrah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We're spinning you around and around and then you can pin the tail on the pony."
Pinkie Pie says: "Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail."
Gilda says: "Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail."
Gilda says: "Hmph, yeah, right."
Gilda says: "This is another prank, isn't it?"
Gilda says: "I'm going this way."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait."
Pinkie Pie says: "The poster is this—"
Gilda says: "Whoa whaa waah waah waaaaah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, Gilda?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You pinned the tail on the wrong end."
Gilda says: "This is your idea of a good time?"
Gilda says: "I've never met a lamer bunch of dweebs in all my life!"
Gilda says: "And Pinkie Pie, you!"
Gilda says: "You are queen lame-o with your weak little party pranks!"
Gilda says: "Did you really think you could make me lose my cool?"
Gilda says: "Well, Dash and I have ten times as much cool as the rest of you put together!"
Gilda says: "Come on Dash, we're bailing on this pathetic scene."
Gilda says: "Come on, Rainbow Dash."
Gilda says: "I said, we're leaving."
Rainbow Dash says: "You know Gilda, I was the one who set up all those weak pranks at this party."
Gilda says: "What?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh."
Rainbow Dash says: "So I guess I'm queen lame-o."
Gilda says: "Come on, Dash, you're joshing me."
Rainbow Dash says: "They weren't all meant for you specifically, it was just dumb luck that you set them all off."
Pinkie Pie says: "I shoulda known, that dribble cup had Rainbow Dash written all over it."
Gilda says: "No way, i-it was Pinkie Pie!"
Gilda says: "She set up this party to trip me up, to make a fool of me."
Pinkie Pie says: "Me?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I threw this party to improve your attitude."
Pinkie Pie says: "I thought a good party might turn that frown upside down."
Rainbow Dash says: "And you sure didn't need any help making a fool of yourself."
Rainbow Dash says: "You know, this is not how I thought my old friends would treat my new friends."
Rainbow Dash says: "If being cool is all you care about, maybe you should go find some new cool friends someplace else."
Gilda says: "Rrgh..."
Gilda says: "yeah?"
Gilda says: "Well you, you..."
Gilda says: "you are such a, a flip-flop, cool one minute and lame the next."
Gilda says: "When you decide not to be lame anymore, gimme a call."
Rainbow Dash says: "Not cool."
Spike says: "Wow, talk about a party pooper."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wow, what was that about?"
Merry May says: "Um, what just happened?"
Pony says: "Really awkward."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm sorry everypony, for bringing Gilda here."
Rainbow Dash says: "I didn't know how rude she was."
Rainbow Dash says: "And Pinkie Pie, I'm really sorry she ruined that awesome party you put on for her."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, if you want to hang out with party poopers, that's your business."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'd rather hang out with you."
Rainbow Dash says: "No hard feelings?"
Pinkie Pie says: "No hard feelings."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey Pinkie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sorry I accused you of misjudging Gilda."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Looks like I'm the one who misjudged you."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's okay Twilight, even you can't be a super smart smarty smart-pants all the time."
Pinkie Pie says: "Come on everypony, there's still a whole lotta party to finish."
Today I learned that it's hard to accept when somepony you like wants to spend time with somepony who's not so nice. Though it's impossible to control who your friends hang out with, it is possible to control your own behavior. Just continue to be a good friend. In the end, the difference between a false friend and one who's true will surely come to light.
Your faithful student,.
