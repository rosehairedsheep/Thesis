Fluttershy says: "Lunch time!"
Fluttershy says: "Who's hungry?"
Fluttershy says: "Plenty for everypony."
Fluttershy says: "Slow down, sweetie."
Fluttershy says: "Here you go, Angel bunny."
Fluttershy says: "Okay, Mister Picky-pants, you win."
Fluttershy says: "Carrots, lettuce and apples, yum-yum-yum!"
Fluttershy says: "What?"
Fluttershy says: "But..."
Fluttershy says: "Well then, what will you eat?"
Fluttershy says: "I'm not sure I can even make that."
Fluttershy says: "Well..."
Fluttershy says: "I don't want you to starve..."
Fluttershy says: "I'll make your special recipe."
Fluttershy says: "Hmm, let's see."
Fluttershy says: "Asparagus."
Fluttershy says: "Excuse me, um, I think you just stepped in front of me?"
Fluttershy says: "Excuse me, I think you made a mistake?"
Lucy Packard says: "Sorry, didn't notice you there."
Fluttershy says: "I know."
Sand Trap says: "Yes, what?"
Fluttershy says: "I think you just cut in front of me."
Sand Trap says: "A cut of celery?"
Sand Trap says: "But– this is the asparagus stand!"
Fluttershy says: "I said  I think you just cut in front of me."
Sand Trap says: "Ohoh, no need, dearie, I'm already in front!"
Fluttershy says: "I noticed."
"Turf" says: "..."
"Turf" says: "And I was like, 'Oh, wow."
Fluttershy says: "Hey!"
"Turf" says: "Would you mind moving back?"
"Turf" says: "You're in my personal space."
"Surf" says: "Seriously, do you need your asparagus so badly?"
"Surf" says: "Get a life."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, okay."
Fluttershy says: "There's no rush."
Rarity says: "Fluttershy, you mustn't let them treat you that way."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, it's-it's really no big deal..."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's bigger than big."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's double big."
Pinkie Pie says: "You are a pony with a problem."
Fluttershy says: "What problem?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, go right ahead, Pinkie Pie."
Fluttershy says: "You first."
Pinkie Pie says: "Right there!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's the problem."
Rarity says: "You've got to stop being such a doormat."
Fluttershy says: "A doormat?"
Rarity says: "A pushover, darling."
Rarity says: "You've got to stand up for yourself, promise us."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, okay."
Fluttershy says: "I promise."
Fluttershy says: "Oh!"
Fluttershy says: "Good!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, that's okay, I don't mind."
Rarity says: "Watch and learn."
Rarity says: "Hold it right there, Mister small and handsome."
Gizmo says: "Uh, who, me?"
Rarity says: "Oh, of course you."
Rarity says: "Nopony ever called you handsome before?"
Gizmo says: "Uhh, that'd be a big no."
Rarity says: "Oh, well, they should!"
Rarity says: "How about flexing some of your muscles for me?"
Rarity says: "Oh, my heavens!"
Rarity says: "Do you think a strong, handsome stallion such as yourself could give my friend the last asparagus?"
Gizmo says: "Nuhh."
Rarity says: "See, that's not so hard, is it?"
Fluttershy says: "Um..."
Fluttershy says: "I guess not."
Rarity says: "Alright then!"
Rarity says: "What else is on your list?"
Fluttershy says: "Let's see..."
Fluttershy says: "I also need tomatoes."
Fluttershy says: "Here you go."
"Roma" says: "That'll be two bits."
"Roma" says: "Not one."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, but last week, it was only one bit."
"Roma" says: "That was then, this is now."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, okay."
Fluttershy says: "I don't wanna argue about it."
Pinkie Pie says: "What do you think you're doing?"
"Roma" says: "Mindin' my own business, maybe you should try it."
Pinkie Pie says: "Two bits for tomatoes is outrageous."
Pinkie Pie says: "One bit is the right price."
"Roma" says: "I say it's two bits."
Pinkie Pie says: "One bit."
"Roma" says: "Two bits!"
Pinkie Pie says: "One bit!"
"Roma" says: "Two bits!"
Pinkie Pie says: "One bit!"
"Roma" says: "Two bits!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Two bits!"
"Roma" says: "One bit!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Two bits!"
"Roma" says: "One bit!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I insist it's two bits or nothing!"
"Roma" says: "One bit and that's my final offer!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Have it your way, one bit it is!"
Pinkie Pie says: "See?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Asserting yourself can be fun!"
Fluttershy says: "I guess you're right!"
Rarity says: "So, Fluttershy, do you feel like giving it a try?"
Fluttershy says: "Um..."
Fluttershy says: "okay."
Fluttershy says: "Boy, am I glad you have one cherry left."
Fluttershy says: "You see, I'm making this special meal for my bunny Angel."
Fluttershy says: "He's a very picky eater, and the recipe calls for a cherry on top."
Fluttershy says: "Here you go."
Crafty Crate says: "So, you say you need this cherry 'very badly'."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, yes, I'm desperate for it!"
Crafty Crate says: "Then it'll be ten bits!"
Fluttershy says: "Ten?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, hey, mister handsome, I know you wanna do the right thing because you're handsome and strong, and big, handsome, strong guys are always nice to everypony, right?"
Crafty Crate says: "Ten bits for the cherry."
Fluttershy says: "Ten bits for one cherry's outrageous!"
Fluttershy says: "I insist on paying you..."
Fluttershy says: "eleven bits!"
Crafty Crate says: "Eleven bits?"
Fluttershy says: "Umm..."
Fluttershy says: "I mean, nine bits!"
Crafty Crate says: "Er, now wait a minute."
Fluttershy says: "Okay, twelve bits, but that's my final offer!"
Crafty Crate says: "I think you're confused."
Fluttershy says: "It's twelve bits, take it or leave it."
Crafty Crate says: "Okay, I'll take it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't give him your money!"
Pinkie Pie says: "One cherry is not worth twelve bits!"
Fluttershy says: "But..."
Fluttershy says: "I was only doing what you did."
Rarity says: "It was a valiant effort, but you should refuse to give him your business and just walk away."
Fluttershy says: "But..."
Fluttershy says: "I can't let Angel starve!"
Fluttershy says: "He won't eat it unless I make it just right!"
Fluttershy says: "I need that cherry no matter what it costs!"
Crafty Crate says: "In that case, twenty bits!"
Fluttershy says: "Twenty?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, but, I don't have that much!"
Crafty Crate says: "Then why're you wasting my time?"
Lemon Hearts says: "I'll give you two bits for that cherry!"
Crafty Crate says: "Sold!"
Crafty Crate says: "Eh, tough break, kid."
Crafty Crate says: "Next time, don't be such a doormat."
Fluttershy says: "Ta-da!"
Fluttershy says: "Here you go, Angel."
Fluttershy says: "Sorry there's no cherry on top, but the rest of it is exactly what you wanted."
Fluttershy says: "Angel?"
Fluttershy says: "Look at me..."
Fluttershy says: "I really am a doormat."
Fluttershy says: ""The incredible Iron Will turns doormats into dynamos."
Fluttershy says: "Assertiveness seminar today, hedge maze centre."
Fluttershy says: "" As Celestia is my witness, I'm never gonna be a pushover again!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh!"
Fluttershy says: "Ah!"
Fluttershy says: "Uh..."
Fluttershy says: "excuse me!"
Iron Will says: "Welcome, friends!"
Iron Will says: "My name is Iron Will, and today is the first day of your new life!"
Iron Will says: "I wanna hear you stomp if you're tired of being a pushover!"
Iron Will says: "Stomp if you're tired of being a doormat!"
Iron Will says: "Stomp if you wanna pay nothing for this seminar!"
Iron Will says: "That's no joke, friends."
Iron Will says: "Iron Will is so confident that you will be one hundred percent satisfied with Iron Will's assertiveness techniques, that if you are not one hundred percent satisfied, you."
Iron Will says: "Pay."
Iron Will says: "Nothing."
Iron Will says: "But I pity the fool who doubts Iron Will's methods!"
Iron Will says: "You don't doubt me, do you?"
Meadow Song says: "Uh-uh, no sir..."
Iron Will says: "That, my friends, is your first lesson."
Iron Will says: ""Don't be shy; look 'em in the eye."
Iron Will says: "Now, to demonstrate that Iron Will's techniques will work for anypony, I'm gonna need a volunteer."
Iron Will says: "You in the back row!"
Fluttershy says: "Who, me?"
Iron Will says: "Yes, you!"
Iron Will says: "Iron Will wants you onstage!"
Fluttershy says: "Uh, well..."
Iron Will says: "Now!"
Fluttershy says: "Okay."
Iron Will says: "Whoaa!"
Iron Will says: "He's blocking your path."
Iron Will says: "What are you gonna do about it?"
Fluttershy says: "Um, politely walk around him?"
Iron Will says: "No."
Fluttershy says: "Gingerly tip-toe around him?"
Iron Will says: "No!"
Fluttershy says: "Go back home and try again tomorrow?"
Iron Will says: "No!"
Iron Will says: ""When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh!"
Fluttershy says: "Sorry."
Iron Will says: "Don't be sorry!"
Iron Will says: "Be assertive!"
Iron Will says: ""Never apologize when you can criticize."
Iron Will says: ""  Why don't you watch where you're going!"
Iron Will says: "?"
Iron Will says: "Now, you try."
Fluttershy says: "Uh..."
Fluttershy says: "next time, get out of the way before..."
Fluttershy says: "I bump into you, 'cause..."
Fluttershy says: "I totally won't be sorry when I do!"
Iron Will says: "You see, my friends?"
Iron Will says: "If my techniques can work for this shy, little pony, then they can work for anypony!"
Fluttershy says: "Okay, I feel good."
Fluttershy says: "I feel ready to "attack the day", as Iron Will says."
Fluttershy says: "Excuse me, Mr."
Fluttershy says: "Greenhooves, but I-I think you might be over-watering my petunias..."
Fluttershy says: "..."
Fluttershy says: "again."
Mr. Greenhooves says: "Let the professional handle it."
Fluttershy says: ""Treat me like a pushover, and you'll get the once over."
Mr. Greenhooves says: "Hm?"
Mr. Greenhooves says: "Hmm..."
Mr. Greenhooves says: "Well, perhaps that is enough water."
Fluttershy says: "Thank you."
Fluttershy says: "I can't believe it worked!"
Cherry Berry says: "Showpony business is tough."
Sweetie Drops says: "Go ahead, try one of your jokes out on me."
Sweetie Drops says: "I laugh at everything."
Cherry Berry says: "Okay, okay, okay."
Cherry Berry says: "A donkey and a mule are stuck on a desert island..."
Fluttershy says: "Excuse me?"
Fluttershy says: "Would you mind moving your carts so I can pass?"
Cherry Berry says: "Yeah yeah, in a minute, I just wanna finish up this story."
Fluttershy says: "A-hemmmm, can you move?"
Fluttershy says: "You're blocking my path."
Cherry Berry says: "Yeah yeah, in a minute!"
Cherry Berry says: "So the donkey says to the mule..."
Fluttershy says: ""When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!"
Cherry Berry says: "..."
Cherry Berry says: "Ugh!"
Cherry Berry says: "Easy does it, lady."
Cherry Berry says: "We're moving, okay?"
Fluttershy says: "Good!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Who's next please?"
Pinkie Pie says: "And what can I get for you today?"
Fluttershy says: "What do you think you're doing?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Didn't you see me?"
Shoeshine says: "Uh, I guess maybe."
Fluttershy says: "'Maybe'?"
Fluttershy says: ""Maybes are for babies!"
Fluttershy says: ""  Now go to the back of the line where you belong!"
VCR rewind sound.
Pinkie Pie says: "Heyyy, look at you!"
Rarity says: "Oh, your attitude is so feisty, it's fabulous."
Pinkie Pie says: "Looks like that monster's workshop really paid off!"
Fluttershy says: "Iron Will's not a monster."
Fluttershy says: "He's a minotaur, and a true inspiration."
Fluttershy says: "His techniques really work."
Rarity says: "Well, they've certainly made a difference in the way you carry yourself."
Rarity says: "You truly are a whole new Fluttershy."
Fluttershy says: "Yes I am."
Fluttershy says: "And new Fluttershy feels pretty stoked about new Fluttershy."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, old Pinkie Pie feels really proud of new Fluttershy."
Pinkie Pie says: "Proud as pink punch."
Pinkie Pie says: "Want some?"
Fluttershy says: ""You laugh at me, I wrath at you!"
Fluttershy says: "Bye, girls."
Fluttershy says: "What a day."
Fluttershy says: "Taxi!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh no you don't."
Fluttershy says: ""Cut in line, I'll take what's mine!"
Royal Riff says: "Aieeeeee!"
Royal Riff says: "Ow..."
Fluttershy says: "Nopony pushes new Fluttershy around!"
Fluttershy says: "Nopony!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Old Pinkie Pie is not so sure new Fluttershy is such a good idea after all."
Rarity says: "Old Rarity agrees."
Fluttershy says: "You got this, new Fluttershy!"
Fluttershy says: "This day is yours!"
Fluttershy says: "And nopony's gonna take it away from you!"
Fluttershy says: "Am I right?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "Right!"
Fluttershy says: "What?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "He's delivered the wrong mail, again!"
Fluttershy says: "And new Fluttershy does not want the wrong mail delivered to her cottage."
"Mr. Zippy" says: "Ohh, did I mix 'em up again?"
"Mr. Zippy" says: "Sorry about that."
Fluttershy says: ""You apologize, I penalize!"
"Mr. Zippy" says: "Oh!"
Globe Trotter says: "Excuse me, do you know how to get to the Ponyville tower?"
Globe Trotter says: "Oh, that's a shame."
Fluttershy says: ""You make me lose, I blow my fuse!"
Globe Trotter says: "Hey!"
Rarity says: "Fluttershy!"
Rarity says: "What are you doing?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "That's no way to behave!"
Fluttershy says: "Didn't you see what he did to new Fluttershy?"
Fluttershy says: "And he thought new Fluttershy was a pushover!"
Rarity says: "No, sweetie, he didn't."
Rarity says: "We saw the whole thing."
Rarity says: "We think that you've taken your assertiveness training a little too far."
Fluttershy says: "What?!"
Fluttershy says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "You just want new Fluttershy to be a doormat like old Fluttershy!"
Fluttershy says: "But old Fluttershy is gone!"
Pinkie Pie says: "New Fluttershy?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Old Fluttershy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "?"
Rarity says: "What happened to nice Fluttershy?"
Rarity says: "We want that Fluttershy back."
Fluttershy says: "No, you want wimp Fluttershy."
Fluttershy says: "You want pushover Fluttershy."
Fluttershy says: "You want do-anything-to-her-and-she-won't-complain Fluttershy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Nyaaaaah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Too many Fluttershys to keep track of!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Make it stop!"
Fluttershy says: "Things getting too complicated for your simple little brain, Pinkie Pie?"
Rarity says: "Now, stop right there!"
Rarity says: "Let's not let things descend into petty insults!"
Fluttershy says: "Why not?"
Fluttershy says: "I thought 'petty' was what you're all about, Rarity."
Fluttershy says: "With your 'petty' concerns about fashion."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, leave her alone!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Fashion is her passion!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, and what are you passionate about?"
Fluttershy says: "Birthday cake?"
Fluttershy says: "Party hats?"
Fluttershy says: "I can't believe that the two most frivolous ponies in Ponyville are trying to tell new Fluttershy how to live her life when they are throwing their own lives away on pointless pursuits that nopony else gives a flying feather about!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Looks like nasty Fluttershy is here to stay!"
Rarity says: "I cannot believe what that monster Iron Will has done to you!"
Fluttershy says: "Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur!"
Fluttershy says: "I'm the monster."
Rarity says: "Fluttershy, are you in there?"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's Pinkie Pie and Rarity!"
Fluttershy says: "Go away!"
Fluttershy says: "Go away before nasty Fluttershy strikes again!"
Rarity says: "Oh, sweetie, we all said things that we regret."
Pinkie Pie says: "We did?"
Rarity says: "Shh."
Fluttershy says: "But don't worry, I'm never coming out of my house again."
Fluttershy says: "Everypony will be a lot safer with me and my mean mouth locked away."
Rarity says: "Pinkie Pie doesn't blame you, nor do I."
Rarity says: "You just received some bad advice from that Iron Will character."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "He's the one that made you act super-duper nasty."
Pinkie Pie says: "What I mean is, there are other ways to assert yourself besides yelling at everypony."
Rarity says: "Yes!"
Rarity says: "You can stand up for yourself without being unpleasant about it."
Fluttershy says: "I-I'm not sure I can."
Fluttershy says: "I'm too far gone."
Fluttershy says: "Whenever I try to assert myself, I become a monster."
Rarity says: "Oh, sweetie, you're not a monster."
Pinkie Pie says: "No, but he is."
Iron Will says: "Iron Will's my name, training ponies is my game."
Rarity says: "What a darling little catchphrase."
Iron Will says: "Your friend Fluttershy loved Iron Will's catchphrases."
Iron Will says: "Word on the street is that she doesn't take no guff from nopony!"
Iron Will says: "So, Iron Will is here to collect Iron Will's fee."
Pinkie Pie says: "Fluttershy is in no shape to deal with that creep!"
Rarity says: "I'm sure a big, brave, powerful, and rich monster– I mean, minotaur like you doesn't need that money right away."
Rarity says: "You can afford to come back later."
Iron Will says: "Are you kidding?"
Iron Will says: "Fluttershy is overdue as it is."
Iron Will says: "Iron Will collects now."
Rarity says: "Do something!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We're not even sure Fluttershy is home right now."
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, she might be off frolicking with some woodland creatures."
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, why don't you give us some time to track her down for ya?"
Iron Will says: "Iron Will does have some grocery shopping to do."
Iron Will says: "Iron Will will come back this afternoon."
Pinkie Pie says: "But that's only half a day."
Pinkie Pie says: "We need one full day at least."
Iron Will says: "Iron Will will delay for half a day and no longer!"
Pinkie Pie says: "A full day!"
Iron Will says: "Half day!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Full day!"
Iron Will says: "Half day!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Half day!"
Iron Will says: "Full day!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We need half a day and no more!"
Iron Will says: "Well, you'll get a full day and no less!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Okie-dokie."
Pinkie Pie says: "See you tomorrow."
Iron Will says: "Wait, what?"
Iron Will says: "Huh, sounds like the search won't be necessary."
Iron Will says: "Iron Will collects now."
Pinkie Pie says: "But we had an agreement!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You gotta come back tomorrow!"
Iron Will says: ""When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!"
Iron Will says: "Your payment is overdue, Fluttershy!"
Iron Will says: "You were nothing but a doormat, and Iron Will turned you into a lean, mean, assertive machine!"
Iron Will says: "Now, pay Iron Will what you owe Iron Will!"
Fluttershy says: "Um, no."
Iron Will says: "What did you say?"
Fluttershy says: "No."
Iron Will says: "Ohhh, I'd hate to be you right now, because Iron Will is gonna rain down a world of hurt unless Iron Will gets his money pronto!"
Fluttershy says: "As I recall, during your workshop you promised one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed, or you pay nothing."
Fluttershy says: "Well, I'm not satisfied."
Iron Will says: "What do you mean you're not satisfied?!"
Iron Will says: "!"
Iron Will says: "Everypony has always been satisfied!"
Fluttershy says: "Well, I guess I'm the first then."
Fluttershy says: "But since I'm not satisfied, I refuse to pay."
Fluttershy says: "It's as simple as that."
Iron Will says: "Ohh, are you..."
Iron Will says: "sure you're not just a little bit satisfied?"
Iron Will says: "B-because maybe..."
Iron Will says: "we could cut a deal."
Iron Will says: "I-I mean we're both reasonable creatures, aren't we?"
Fluttershy says: "I'm sorry, but no means no."
Iron Will says: "No means no, huh?"
Iron Will says: "Nopony's ever said that to me before."
Iron Will says: "Huh..."
Iron Will says: "I gotta remember that one."
Iron Will says: "That's a good catchphrase for my next workshop."
Pinkie Pie says: "You were amazing, Fluttershy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You totally stood up to that monster!"
Rarity says: "In fact, you didn't change at all!"
Rarity says: "You were the same old Fluttershy that we've always loved!"
Pinkie Pie says: "The one we missed!"
Fluttershy says: "Don't worry, old Fluttershy's back for good."
Fluttershy says: "I'm sorry I took the whole assertiveness thing too far."
Fluttershy says: "Friends?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Friends."
Rarity says: "Friends."
Sometimes it can be hard for a shy pony like me to stand up for myself, and when I first tried it, I didn't like the pony I became. But I've learned that standing up for yourself isn't the same as changing who you are. Now I know how to put my hoof down without being unpleasant or mean.
