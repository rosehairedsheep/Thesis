Pinkie Pie says: "Happy Hearth's Warming Eve!"
Applejack says: "Shucks, Twilight!"
Applejack says: "Y'all done it up nice and cozy in here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We're about to hang our Hearth's Warming dolls if you wanna join us."
Applejack says: "Oh, that's mighty sweet of you, but we're just stoppin' in to wish y'all a happy Hearth's Warmin' before we go."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I think it's sweet that your families are spending the holiday together."
Pinkie Pie says: "Picture the most fun-tacular thing you can think of."
Pinkie Pie says: "Now multiply that times infinity!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoo!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's gonna be great!"
Applejack says: "That's us."
Applejack says: "See you later!"
Spike says: "Now can we open presents?"
Applejack says: "But tonight is Hearth's Warming Eve."
Applejack says: "Everypony knows you don't open presents 'til tomorrow."
Twilight Sparkle says: "When Spike and I spent our first Hearth's Warming Eve together, he couldn't wait all night to open his presents!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ever since then, we've always opened them the night before!"
Spike says: "It's kinda like our tradition!"
Applejack says: "That's not how our family does it, and I reckon it can't be how Pinkie's does it."
Applejack says: "Is it?"
Pinkie Pie says: "No sirree!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "To each their own, I suppose."
Pinkie Pie says: "Agh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Gotta go, bye!"
Spike says: "Just what I always wanted!"
Spike says: "A book..."
Porter Pony says: "Chancellor Puddinghead puddings!"
Porter Pony says: "How 'bout a Windigo-frosted snow cone?"
Applejack says: "It's so excitin'!"
Applejack says: "Related or not, it's gonna be a hoot havin' our families together under one roof!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Apples and Pies together again for the first time!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Maybe."
Pinkie Pie says: "Unless we're related!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Which maybe we're not."
Pinkie Pie says: "I think I just confused myself."
Applejack says: "Friends or family, this here's about togetherness."
Apple Bloom says: "Have you tried the Equestria flag crepes?"
Apple Bloom says: "The blue is blueberry!"
Apple Bloom says: "And don't tell Granny I saw, but her trunk is full of presents!"
Applejack says: "Now hang on, sugarcube."
Applejack says: "You know Hearth's Warmin' isn't just about candy and presents, right?"
Apple Bloom says: "Uh-oh."
Apple Bloom says: "That's your boring sisterly lecture voice."
Applejack says: "'Fraid so!"
Applejack says: "A long time ago, the Earth ponies, Pegasus ponies, and unicorn ponies weren't friends."
Pinkie Pie says: "I don't like you either!"
Applejack says: "But then, the icy chill of the Windigos almost iced up everythin'."
Applejack says: "So the ponies decided to work together, and their friendship drove them nasty critters away."
Pinkie Pie says: "Beat it, Windigos!"
Applejack says: "Triumphant, they raised a new flag to celebrate all three tribes, and Equestria was born."
Applejack says: "Uh, what happened to the flag?"
Apple Bloom says: "Is that why we celebrate with a flag raisin' tomorrow?"
Applejack says: "Mm-hmm!"
Applejack says: "And tonight, we'll have the traditional Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner to remember the shared bounties of our ancestors."
Pinkie Pie says: "We do that too!"
Applejack says: "Then we'll hang our Hearth's Warmin' dolls over the fireplace to remind us of the warmth shared on that fateful night."
Pinkie Pie says: "That's what our family does too!"
Applejack says: "And tomorrow, we open presents!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We do that too!"
Apple Bloom says: "Sounds like the Apples and the Pies do everything the same way!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm so happy, I need to make up a new word for how happy I am."
Pinkie Pie says: "What about..."
Pinkie Pie says: ""rooftastic"?"
Applejack says: ""Rooftastic"?"
Pinkie Pie says: "As in, I'm gonna stand on the roof and yell to everypony how rooftastic this is!"
Applejack says: "What if our families don't like each other?"
Pinkie Pie says: "We are friends, Applejack, and after tonight, our families are gonna be friends too."
Pinkie Pie says: "Do you know what that means?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Number of Apples times number of Pies is twenty four, minus my preexisting friendships plus one for Maud and you makes five from twenty four is..."
Maud Pie says: "I'm so excited to see you, Pinkie Pie."
Maud Pie says: "You too, Applejack."
Maud Pie says: "I hope you had fun sledding yesterday."
Applejack says: "How'd you know that?"
Maud Pie says: "Isn't it obvious?"
Maud Pie says: "There are specks of extrusive andesite on your hoof."
Maud Pie says: "It's a mountain rock."
Granny Smith says: "Oh, she's good."
Pinkie Pie says: "How's school going?"
Maud Pie says: "If you thought quartz was high on the Mohs hardness scale, wait 'til I tell you about corundum."
Pinkie Pie says: "I missed you so much!"
Apple family says: "Mm-hmm."
Applejack says: "This place looks amazin'!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Come on, everypony!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Meet my super-mega-fun-derful family!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Everypony, meet everypony!"
Igneous Rock says: "Surely thy name is not but Granny Smith."
Igneous Rock says: "I am called Igneous Rock Pie, son of Feldspar Granite Pie."
Cloudy Quartz says: "Thou shalt know me as Cloudy Quartz."
Igneous Rock says: "May Providence favor thee well, and to thou comfort our humble homestead bring."
Granny Smith says: "Y'all gabbin' with words real funny-like."
Granny Smith says: "Wh-wh-what'd you say them names were?"
Granny Smith says: ""Iggy"?"
Granny Smith says: "And I'm just gonna call you "Big Mama Q"!"
Limestone Pie says: "Gaze into the eyes of Limestone Pie."
Limestone Pie says: "Ma and Pa may own this rock farm, but I keep it running."
Limestone Pie says: "Cross me and—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Aye aye, Captain Grumpy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No one's gonna mess with your precious mine!"
Limestone Pie says: "Or Holder's Boulder!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Everypony stay away from Holder's Boulder."
Pinkie Pie says: "There, you happy now?"
Applejack says: "And you must be—"
Pinkie Pie says: "This is Marble Pie, my baby sister who's only a few minutes younger than me but she'll always be a baby to me, isn't that right?"
Pinkie Pie says: "She's so excited to meet everypony!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, and she wishes you all a happy Hearth's Warming!"
Marble Pie says: "Mm-hmm."
Applejack says: "Guess Pinkie Pie always did the talkin' for her."
Pinkie Pie says: "Attention!"
Limestone Pie says: "What'd I say about the boulder?!"
Limestone Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'll just be a second."
Pinkie Pie says: "Everypony get settled in!"
Pinkie Pie says: "There's plenty of room upstairs."
Pinkie Pie says: "And then it's time for Hearth's Warming Eve dinner!"
Applejack says: "So far, so good, cousin!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hee-hee!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, I can't wait to taste their fresh sweet rolls!"
Apple Bloom says: "They're my favorite part of Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner."
Granny Smith says: "I'm more of a six-layer bean dip filly myself!"
Apple Bloom says: "I love that too!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, Applejack, do you think theirs'll be even better than ours?"
Applejack says: "Well, that's a mighty tall order, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least."
Pinkie Pie says: "Are you excited for dinner time?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Because guess who is!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Spoiler alert – it's me!"
Applejack says: "What about hot rolls and mulled cider and double-baked pot pie?"
Granny Smith says: "Uh, what about six-layer bean dip?"
Maud Pie says: "We have rock soup."
Pinkie Pie says: "Potato, po-tah-to."
Pinkie Pie says: "Double-baked pot pie, rock soup!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Dinner is dinner."
Pinkie Pie says: "Am I right or am I right?"
Applejack says: "Yeah, um, you know what?"
Applejack says: "This is what we were expectin'!"
Applejack says: "Right, everypony?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is everything all right, Applejack?"
Applejack says: "O' course, I'm just being a rusty fiddle."
Applejack says: "Tune me up and let's get back to dinner."
Pinkie Pie says: "More rock, please!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Eat up, so we can get to our Hearth's Warming dolls!"
Applejack says: "Now that's somethin' I know all about!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Who wants a Hearth's Warming doll?"
Applejack says: "Are you sayin' that rock is a Hearth's Warmin' doll?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't be silly, silly!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Our dolls are these little pieces!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Isn't that right, Marble Pie?"
Marble Pie says: "Mm-hmm."
Apple Bloom says: "Our dolls are..."
Apple Bloom says: "rocks?"
Applejack says: "Uh..."
Applejack says: "y'all don't have traditional crocheted dolls passed down in your family?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Aww, you're just a frown factory because you got a weird rock."
Pinkie Pie says: "Cheer up!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm sure you'll do great in the flag finding mission!"
Applejack says: "The what findin' what now?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Limestone Pie, you're the judge!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Big Mac, Marble Pie, you're team one!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Apple Bloom and Maud, you're team two!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ma, Pa, you're gonna be with Granny Smith."
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't think of it as team old."
Pinkie Pie says: "Think of it as team three!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And I'm with Applejack of course, since we might be cousins!"
Applejack says: "So now that we're all split up, mind tellin' us what we're doin'?"
Pinkie Pie says: "As everypony knows—"
Limestone Pie says: "Stay off Holder's Boulder!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Sheesh."
Pinkie Pie says: "When the three tribes united to form Equestria, the first flag was sewn by Nimble Thimble."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's tradition to raise a flag on Hearth's Warming to celebrate that famous day."
Pinkie Pie says: "But who gets to put the flag on Holder's Boulder?"
Applejack says: "You mean on the flagpole?"
Pinkie Pie says: "No, silly, it goes on the highest point!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And who's the lucky pony?"
Applejack says: "Traditionally, it's the youngest—"
Pinkie Pie says: "On your marks, get set, go!"
Applejack says: "Pinkie Pie, will you please tell us what's goin' on?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'll explain on the way!"
Applejack says: "I still don't understand."
Pinkie Pie says: "Earlier today, Limestone Pie hid an obsidian stone."
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoever finds it gets to raise the flag!"
Applejack says: "It's all just so..."
Applejack says: "complicated, and..."
Applejack says: "rock-based."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, how else would we do it?"
Applejack says: "I don't know."
Applejack says: "I sure hope everypony else is havin' a better time."
Marble Pie says: "Mm-hmm."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Marble Pie says: "Mm-hmm."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeeeeeeeeyup."
Granny Smith says: "So, how'd you meet this Iggy feller?"
Cloudy Quartz says: "We were chosen by the Pairing Stone and betrothed within a fortnight."
Igneous Rock says: "The choosing stone decreed, "Thou shalt love one another."
Igneous Rock says: "" And lo, it was so."
Granny Smith says: "Hoo-wee, I gots to look into this oldfangled choosin' stone thing."
Granny Smith says: "You reckon it knows any apple-farmin' hunks?"
Igneous Rock says: "Indeed so."
Cloudy Quartz says: "Mmm."
Apple Bloom says: "What does the rock look like?"
Maud Pie says: "It looks like something that formed when volcanic lava cooled quickly."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh."
Maud Pie says: "Have you ever wished you could turn into a rock?"
Apple Bloom says: "I had a dream once I was an apple."
Maud Pie says: "We have a lot in common when it comes to thinking about turning into things."
Pinkie Pie says: "Found it, found it, found it!"
Applejack says: "A picture?"
Applejack says: "I've been lookin' for a real stone, Pinkie Pie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Um, that would be weird."
Pinkie Pie says: "Do you know what this means?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I get to raise the flag, and now it's time to hide the presents!"
Applejack says: "Y'all hide your presents?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Of course!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What's more fun than getting a present?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Finding a present!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Although, most years, nopony finds one."
Applejack says: "So nopony gets presents?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Eh, not usually."
Applejack says: "So lemme get all this straight."
Applejack says: "You're only allowed to eat rock soup for dinner, then the pony who finds this rock gets to raise the flag, but not really 'cause you don't got no flagpole, and to top it off, you don't even get presents?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, it doesn't sound very fun when you say it that way."
Applejack says: "Well, how 'bout you picture this?"
Applejack says: "Both our families, openin' presents, raisin' the flag..."
Applejack says: "?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Picturing it..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Loving it..."
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Goodnight, everypony!"
Applejack says: "Goodnight, Pinkie Pie!"
Applejack says: "We've gotta do somethin', y'all!"
Applejack says: "Pinkie Pie's family never had a real Hearth's Warmin'!"
Granny Smith says: "Is that really what she said?"
Applejack says: "Well, I-I'm sure it's what she meant."
Apple Bloom says: "These are their traditions."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Applejack says: "I know they have their traditions and we have ours, but I just want them to see how much better theirs could be."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hearth's Warming!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hearth's Warming, Hearth's Warming!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hearth's Warming, Hearth's Warming!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hearth's Warming, Hearth's—"
Igneous Rock says: "Oh, my."
Igneous Rock says: "Oh, my."
Limestone Pie says: "What."
Limestone Pie says: "Happened."
Limestone Pie says: "To."
Limestone Pie says: "My."
Limestone Pie says: "Farm!"
Applejack says: "It's Hearth's Warmin', Apple-style!"
Applejack says: "We've been doin' everythin' your way, I thought we could mix it up a bit!"
Applejack says: "Marble Pie, you could raise the Equestria flag up this pole, because you're the youngest Pie!"
Applejack says: "Ma and Pa Pie, we'll cook you up a meal you'll never forget!"
Applejack says: "And look, we all get presents without havin' to find 'em!"
Pinkie Pie says: "..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah, this is gonna be great!"
Pinkie Pie says: "All the stuff she's said."
Pinkie Pie says: "Right, everypony?"
Igneous Rock says: "Pinkamena Diane Pie!"
Igneous Rock says: "Truly thou cannot favor this madness!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, I wanna be one big family!"
Limestone Pie says: "But what about what we usually do?!"
Limestone Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I, um, well, I-I don't know!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't make me choose!"
Applejack says: "I didn't mean to cause a fuss..."
Applejack says: "Why don't we just open presents around the flag pole?"
Applejack says: "It'll be fun, you'll see!"
Maud Pie says: "Excuse me."
Maud Pie says: "You planted your pole on a fault line."
Limestone Pie says: "Nooooooooooooooo!"
Applejack says: "Oh, boy."
Pinkie Pie says: "You didn't have to ask them to leave!"
Limestone Pie says: "They wanted to go!"
Limestone Pie says: "We don't need anypony forcing their way into our family!"
Pinkie Pie says: "This was all a misunderstanding, everypony!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I know Applejack, and she'd never do anything bad to anypony!"
Limestone Pie says: "Look around, Pinkie Pie!"
Limestone Pie says: "It's gonna take me ages to get this rock farm back on track!"
Limestone Pie says: "And how are we gonna lift Holder's Boulder?!"
Limestone Pie says: "!"
Limestone Pie says: "This is all her fault!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Then it's my fault too..."
Granny Smith says: "Prob'ly best if we head back to Sweet Apple Acres."
Granny Smith says: "Maybe in time we'll be friends again, but for the now it's best if we give them a little space."
Apple Bloom says: "I wish we didn't have to."
Apple Bloom says: "I really like Maud."
Apple Bloom says: "She's sweet once you get to know her."
Apple Bloom says: "They all are."
Apple Bloom says: "Worst Hearth's Warmin' ever."
Granny Smith says: "Eh, has anypony seen Applejack?"
Applejack says: "I really cracked the corn this time."
Pinkie Pie says: "I really popped the piñata this time."
Applejack says: "Pinkie Pie?"
Pinkie Pie says: "What are you doing here?"
Applejack says: "What are you doin' here?"
Applejack says: "Aww."
Pinkie Pie says: "Aww."
Applejack says: "I'm too ashamed to go back up there."
Applejack says: "Your family, my family, they all must think I'm such a nincompoop."
Pinkie Pie says: "Aw, no one thinks that!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pushy, aggressive, mean..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, I'm not helping."
Pinkie Pie says: "Sorry."
Applejack says: "I'm sorry I forced my traditions over yours."
Applejack says: "I don't want you to have to choose between the family you were born into and the friends who love you like one."
Applejack says: "I really hoped we could be one big happy family."
Applejack says: "I guess not."
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't say that!"
Applejack says: "I wish I could stay, but I have a train to catch."
Pinkie Pie says: "H-Ha..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Happy Hearth's Warming."
Applejack says: "You too."
Granny Smith says: "You want to know why Holder's Boulder's so danged important?"
Granny Smith says: "Well, now their great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Holder Cobblestone – he found that boulder in a dragon's nest, older than time itself!"
Granny Smith says: "He built the family farm around it, even though it was just an ordinary rock."
Granny Smith says: "It always brought them good luck."
Applejack says: "Aw, crickets!"
Applejack says: "That is important!"
Applejack says: "I got so caught up in the things they were doin', I never asked why they did 'em!"
Applejack says: "To Applejack, from Pinkie Pie."
Applejack says: "Cousins forever."
Apple Bloom says: "You just found your first Pie Hearth's Warmin' present ever!"
Applejack says: "Stop the train!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Come on..."
Pinkie Pie says: "you..."
Pinkie Pie says: "boulder, come on..."
Pinkie Pie says: "agh!"
Maud Pie says: "I'm pushing as hard as I can too."
Limestone Pie says: "Rrrgh, it's hopeless!"
Applejack says: "Need a little help?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Apples!"
Limestone Pie says: "What do you want?!"
Limestone Pie says: "!"
Applejack says: "I wasn't tryin' to take your traditions away, I was tryin' to share ours."
Applejack says: "I was so focused on us bein' one big happy family, I thought we needed the same traditions right away."
Applejack says: "What I should've done was learn about yours and teach you about ours."
Applejack says: "And over time, we'd make new traditions together."
Applejack says: "I'm sorry, y'all."
Limestone Pie says: "Well, don't just stand there!"
Limestone Pie says: "We got a boulder to move!"
Limestone Pie says: "And I'm in charge."
Pinkie Pie says: "I think we've just invented our first combined tradition!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pushing Holder's Boulder out of the quarry!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I can't wait for Applejack to knock it over next Hearth's Warming!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Marble Pie, you want to wish Big Mac a happy Hearth's Warming, don't you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And you too, right, Big Mac?"
Marble Pie says: "Mm-hmm!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Granny Smith says: "Eh, lemme see here, uh..."
Granny Smith says: "'If thou ask-eth me, uh, thou two art, eh, okay-eth in my book'."
Igneous Rock says: "'Yee-haw'."
Pinkie Pie says: "Happy Hearth's Warming!"
Applejack says: "Happy Hearth's Warmin', Pinkie Pie."
Apple Bloom says: "Attention, everypony!"
Apple Bloom says: "Maud wants to sing some Hearth's Warmin' carols that she wrote!"
Maud Pie says: "Hearth's Warming is great."
Maud Pie says: "Like calcium silicate."
Maud Pie says: "What a wonderful day."
Maud Pie says: "As good as mica or clay."
