Apple Bloom says: "Hear ye, hear ye!"
Apple Bloom says: "This meeting of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session!"
Apple Bloom says: "Who wants to do roll-call?"
Scootaloo says: "I'm pretty sure we're all here."
Sweetie Belle says: "Yeah."
Sweetie Belle says: "Apple Bloom, what's this all about?"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, nothin'..."
Apple Bloom says: "except this letter from Babs Seed sayin' she's got her cutie mark!"
Scootaloo says: "What?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "What?!"
Scootaloo says: "!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "She says it's a pair of scissors!"
Scootaloo says: "So..."
Scootaloo says: "she's good at cutting stuff?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Of course!"
Sweetie Belle says: "She was always fussing with her bangs and tail!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I'll bet she grows up to be a celebrity stylist!"
Apple Bloom says: "But if she spends all her time cuttin' hair, who's gonna run the Manehattan CMCs?"
Scootaloo says: "Well, not Babs."
Scootaloo says: "She can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if she's already got her cutie mark."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, wow."
Apple Bloom says: "I guess you're right."
Sweetie Belle says: "I'm glad she's happy, but I sure wouldn't want to be up to my flank in mane hair all day."
Sweetie Belle says: "Can you imagine getting stuck with a cutie mark you didn't like?"
Apple Bloom says: "No..."
Apple Bloom says: "or at least I hadn't..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Don't worry, Apple Bloom."
Sweetie Belle says: "Most of your family has apple-related cutie marks."
Sweetie Belle says: "I bet yours will be, too."
Sweetie Belle says: "And what's not to like about apples?"
Scootaloo says: "There's the core, and sour apples, and rotten apples, and apples with worms in them—"
Scootaloo says: "What?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Not helping."
Apple Bloom says: "I guess I just spent so much time worryin' about how to get a cutie mark, I never even thought about what would happen after."
Apple Bloom says: "There's just so many things I never considered."
Applejack says: "I'm sure there are, but you don't need to—"
Apple Bloom says: "What if I finally get my cutie mark and I don't like it?"
Apple Bloom says: "What if I get my cutie mark and nopony likes me?"
Applejack says: "Well, that's just ridicu—"
Apple Bloom says: "What if the Crusaders drift apart?"
Apple Bloom says: "I mean, we won't really be the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore!"
Apple Bloom says: "What if it's not an apple?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "Will I have to move out?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "Where will I live?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Applejack says: "All right, that's enough, sugarcube."
Applejack says: "Those are way too many questions to answer all in one night."
Apple Bloom says: "But—"
Applejack says: "And nopony's gonna make ya move out."
Apple Bloom says: "Are you sure, Applejack?"
Applejack says: "Of course, I'm sure."
Applejack says: "Now get some sleep."
Applejack says: "You'll see."
Applejack says: "Everything will be better in the mornin'."
Hush now, little sister.
You're loved by all you know.
You'll never lose their friendship.
No matter where you go.
There ain't no call to worry.
So don't you cry or fret.
A cutie mark won't change you.
No matter what you get.
Apple Bloom says: "No matter what I get."
Apple Bloom says: "Hoo-ee!"
Apple Bloom says: "Nothin' like a good night's sleep!"
Applejack says: "Breakfast!"
Apple Bloom says: "You were right, Applejack!"
Apple Bloom says: "I feel much better!"
Apple Bloom says: "I don't know what I was so worried about last night!"
Applejack says: "See, now what did I tell you?"
Applejack says: "A good night's sleep'll fix just about an—"
Applejack says: "Well, no wonder you were so worked up!"
Apple Bloom says: "What?"
Apple Bloom says: "What is it?"
Applejack says: "Looks like somepony got her cutie mark!"
Apple Bloom says: "I got my cutie mark!"
Apple Bloom says: "Wait 'til I tell the others that my cutie mark is a..."
Apple Bloom says: "a..."
Apple Bloom says: "What is it?"
Applejack says: "I have no idea what it means."
Apple Bloom says: "Infestations?"
Apple Bloom says: "You mean like..."
Apple Bloom says: "parasprites?"
Pest Control Pony says: "Hah, please."
Pest Control Pony says: "Anypony with a trombone can get rid of parasprites."
Pest Control Pony says: "I'm talking about the serious stuff!"
Pest Control Pony says: "You ever hear of..."
Pest Control Pony says: "twittermites?"
Apple Bloom says: "Twittermites?"
Pest Control Pony says: "Pest ponies like you and me are the only things keeping these live wires from destroying half of Equestria!"
Apple Bloom says: "Pest ponies?"
Pest Control Pony says: "It's no easy trade!"
Pest Control Pony says: "Even the best of us yearns for the day they can move on to greener pastures."
Pest Control Pony says: "Oh, now that you're here to take over, my day has finally come!"
Apple Bloom says: "Take over?"
Pest Control Pony says: "You're gonna need to stop repeating what I say and pay attention if you want to learn anything."
Apple Bloom says: "I'm sorry."
Apple Bloom says: "I guess this just wasn't what I was expectin'."
Pest Control Pony says: "Don't worry."
Pest Control Pony says: "With a cutie mark like that I'm sure you've got the touch."
Apple Bloom says: "The touch?"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, sorry."
Pest Control Pony says: "Now, you're gonna need to be quick."
Pest Control Pony says: "Once these things get out, it can get pretty shocking."
Apple Bloom says: "Wait, what do you mean?"
Apple Bloom says: "Ow!"
Pest Control Pony says: "Hah, told you!"
Pest Control Pony says: "And the further apart they spread, the more powerful these jolts will get!"
Apple Bloom says: "What do I do?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Pest Control Pony says: "Call 'em back, of course."
Apple Bloom says: "Twittermites!"
Apple Bloom says: "Twittermites!"
Apple Bloom says: "Bugbugbugbugbugbugbug!"
Pest Control Pony says: "Well, looks like you're all set."
Pest Control Pony says: "Drop me a note sometime at the Piney Shade Retirement Community."
Apple Bloom says: "Now, hold on!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm sure this job is real important, but..."
Apple Bloom says: "I don't think I wanna call bugs for the rest of my life."
Apple Bloom says: "Hey, where'd he go?"
Diamond Tiara says: "Well, well, well!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Look at the new bug pony!"
Apple Bloom says: "It's pest pony."
Silver Spoon says: "Eh, it sure is!"
Silver Spoon says: "Ew!"
Diamond Tiara says: "I might've known you'd end up with the worst cutie mark ever!"
Silver Spoon says: "But look on the bright side!"
Silver Spoon says: "Whenever you need a friend, you can just go out and catch one!"
Apple Bloom says: "That's not funny."
Diamond Tiara says: "Heeere, friendfriendfriendfriendfrieeend!"
Apple Bloom says: "Stop it!"
Silver Spoon says: "Here, bug!"
Silver Spoon says: "Here, bug!"
Silver Spoon says: "Will you be my friend, bug?"
Silver Spoon says: "Because nopony else will!"
Apple Bloom says: "You know what?"
Apple Bloom says: "My cutie mark isn't the worst!"
Apple Bloom says: "You two are!"
Apple Bloom says: "I hate to think that Diamond Tiara is right, but..."
Apple Bloom says: "this cutie mark sure isn't what I was hoping for."
Mysterious Voice says: "Why should you have to keep it, then?"
Apple Bloom says: "Who's there?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "What do you mean?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Mysterious Voice says: "If your cutie mark bothers you so much, get rid of it!"
Apple Bloom says: "Well, if you know how to wave a hoof and erase a terrible cutie mark, you go right ahead!"
Mysterious Voice says: "As easily said as done."
Apple Bloom says: "Huh."
Apple Bloom says: "Now that is some serious magic."
Apple Bloom says: "Hey!"
Apple Bloom says: "Where's everypony goin'?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Wilhelm scream.
Apple Bloom says: "Mayor!"
Apple Bloom says: "What's goin' on?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Mayor Mare says: "Apple Bloom, you've got to get your family out of town!"
Apple Bloom says: "Twittermites!"
Apple Bloom says: "Twittermites!"
Apple Bloom says: "Here, bugbugbugbugbugbug!"
Apple Bloom says: "Here, bugs!"
Apple Bloom says: "Come on, here!"
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom!"
Applejack says: "What in tarnation are you doin'?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm tryin' to stop the infestation, of course!"
Applejack says: "Only a pest pony can do that!"
Applejack says: "Now come on!"
Applejack says: "We gotta skedaddle!"
Apple Bloom says: "But I've gotta do somethin'!"
Applejack says: "Are you crazy?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "Aaaaaaahhh!"
Apple Bloom says: "Whoo-ee."
Apple Bloom says: "That's what I call a nightmare."
Apple Bloom says: "It seemed so real."
Applejack says: "Breakfast!"
Apple Bloom says: "Applejack!"
Apple Bloom says: "You are not gonna believe the dream I just had!"
Apple Bloom says: "I guess I needed more sleep than I thought!"
Applejack says: "See, now what did I tell you?"
Applejack says: "A good night's sleep'll fix just about—"
Applejack says: "Well, no wonder you were so worked up!"
Apple Bloom says: "What?"
Applejack says: "Looks like somepony got her cutie mark!"
Apple Bloom says: "Again?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "I mean..."
Apple Bloom says: "I did?"
Apple Bloom says: "Woo-hoo!"
Apple Bloom says: "Potion making!"
Apple Bloom says: "Now that's more like it!"
Applejack says: "More like what?"
Apple Bloom says: "Never mind."
Apple Bloom says: "I'm just glad Princess Twilight's lessons finally paid off!"
Applejack says: "I expect you want to run off to the clubhouse and tell your friends all about your new cutie mark."
Applejack says: "But before you go, make sure you do all your..."
Applejack says: "chores..."
Applejack says: "?"
Apple Bloom says: "Whooo!"
Scootaloo says: "Why all the excitement?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Yeah, what's going on?"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, nothin'..."
Apple Bloom says: "except this brand new cutie mark!"
Scootaloo says: "That's amazing!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Wow!"
Apple Bloom says: "I know!"
Scootaloo says: "That's so cool!"
Apple Bloom says: "I don't suppose either of you got yours?"
Scootaloo says: "Nope."
Sweetie Belle says: "Me neither..."
Apple Bloom says: "I know it's silly, but I'd always hoped we'd get our cutie marks together."
Scootaloo says: "Me too..."
Sweetie Belle says: "But I'm still super excited for you!"
Scootaloo says: "Absolutely!"
Apple Bloom says: "I know!"
Apple Bloom says: "Let's call this meeting to order!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm sure the three of us can figure out how to get two more cutie marks."
Sweetie Belle says: "Um, yeah..."
Sweetie Belle says: "the thing is..."
Apple Bloom says: "What?"
Scootaloo says: "Well, you can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if you've already got your cutie mark..."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, yeah..."
Apple Bloom says: "Just like Babs Seed..."
Apple Bloom says: "Well, I could just sit quietly in the corner 'til you two figure out what you're gonna do..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, technically the clubhouse is for Crusaders only."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh."
Apple Bloom says: "Right."
Apple Bloom says: "I guess I should just come back later, then..."
Apple Bloom says: "?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Why?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I mean, you can't come in then either."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh."
Sweetie Belle says: "Rules are rules."
Scootaloo says: "I don't even think we're still supposed to be friends."
Apple Bloom says: "What?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "Sweetie Belle!"
Apple Bloom says: "Scootaloo!"
Apple Bloom says: "Come on, fillies, this isn't funny!"
Mysterious Voice says: "More trouble with cutie marks?"
Apple Bloom says: "No!"
Apple Bloom says: "I mean, w—"
Apple Bloom says: "yeah, I mean..."
Apple Bloom says: "Well, I got mine, but my friends didn't get theirs, and now there's all kinds of trouble!"
Mysterious Voice says: "Sounds to me like cutie marks and trouble are two peas in the same pod."
Apple Bloom says: "I guess so..."
Apple Bloom says: "I mean, if I was a blank flank again, there wouldn't be a problem!"
Mysterious Voice says: "Your wish is my command."
Scootaloo says: "Hey, Apple Bloom."
Scootaloo says: "Why'd you want to meet here?"
Apple Bloom says: "Well, us blank flanks have to meet somewhere!"
Scootaloo says: "Um, actually, Apple Bloom, we..."
Scootaloo says: "both sort of got our cutie marks."
Apple Bloom says: "You did?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "What are they?"
Scootaloo says: "Oh, we don't have time to go into all that."
Sweetie Belle says: "And we certainly don't have time to hang out at an old clubhouse."
Scootaloo says: "Yeah, we've got responsibilities now."
Sweetie Belle says: "But maybe we'll see you later."
Scootaloo says: "Much later."
Apple Bloom says: "Wait!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hold on!"
Apple Bloom says: "I can get my cutie mark back, I think!"
Apple Bloom says: "Rrgh!"
Apple Bloom says: "I mean, I got it once, right?"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, just wait a second!"
Apple Bloom says: "Nooooooooooo!"
Apple Bloom says: "What in Equestria's goin' on?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Applejack says: "Breakfast!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm not so sure sleep is the cure-all Applejack thinks it is."
Apple Bloom says: "Uh..."
Apple Bloom says: "Applejack?"
Apple Bloom says: "I know you said sleep is supposed to make me feel better, but I'm pretty sure it's makin' me feel worse."
Applejack says: "See, now what did I tell you?"
Applejack says: "A good night's sleep'll fix—"
Applejack says: "Well, no wonder you were so worked up..."
Apple Bloom says: "Wh—"
Apple Bloom says: "Didn't you hear what I said?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "I was trying to—"
Granny Smith says: "Weeeell, what do we have here?"
Apple Bloom says: "What is it, Granny?"
Apple Bloom says: "What's wrong?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Granny Smith says: "Oh, nothin', right, Applejack?"
Applejack says: "Right..."
Applejack says: "Nothin' at all..."
Applejack says: "Right, Big Mac?"
Big McIntosh says: "Truth is, Apple Bloom, it's your cutie mark."
Applejack says: "Eeyup."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, no!"
Apple Bloom says: "What is it now?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Big McIntosh says: "Well, I can tell you what it ain't."
Big McIntosh says: "It ain't no apple."
Granny Smith says: "Nnope!"
Apple Bloom says: "What?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Applejack says: "And we don't have room for non-apples."
Big McIntosh says: "Nnope."
Granny Smith says: "Time for you to mosey on."
Granny Smith says: "You can't stay here."
Apple Bloom says: "But this is my home!"
Big McIntosh says: "Oh, and you're gonna have to change your name."
Granny Smith says: "Eeyup!"
Big McIntosh says: "I think just 'Bloom' has a nice ring to it, don't you, Applejack?"
Applejack says: "Eeyup!"
Apple Bloom says: "Noooooooooo!"
Apple Bloom says: "Ugh!"
Apple Bloom says: "Alright, this is getting ridiculous."
Apple Bloom says: "Whoo-ee!"
Apple Bloom says: "I never thought I'd be so happy to not get a cutie mark."
Apple Bloom says: "What the?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "I don't wanna see another cutie mark as long as I live!"
Mysterious Voice says: "Back so soon?"
Apple Bloom says: "All right, whoever you are!"
Apple Bloom says: "I dunno what spell you went and cast on me, but I want it to stop right now!"
Mysterious Voice says: "I didn't cast a spell, on you or anypony else."
Mysterious Voice says: "I only did what you wanted."
Apple Bloom says: "Rrrgh!"
Apple Bloom says: "Why would I want you to torment me with nightmares?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Mysterious Voice says: "You didn't want to catch bugs, and I helped."
Mysterious Voice says: "You didn't want to lose friends, and I helped."
Mysterious Voice says: "If there's a problem with your family, I'm sure I can help with that too."
Apple Bloom says: "I don't want your help!"
Apple Bloom says: "Just get away from me!"
Princess Luna says: "Oh, Apple Bloom, you can't get away from your own shadow."
Apple Bloom says: "Princess Luna?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "My shadow?"
Apple Bloom says: "What do you mean?"
Apple Bloom says: "It's just me?"
Apple Bloom says: "You mean I've been doin' all this to myself?"
Princess Luna says: "Of course, Apple Bloom."
Princess Luna says: "It's your dream."
Apple Bloom says: "If I've been dreamin' this whole time, why don't I just wake up?"
Princess Luna says: "Sometimes we can worry about a thing so much, the fear can make us feel we're trapped in a nightmare."
Princess Luna says: "I don't suppose there's anything you're particularly afraid of, is there?"
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah..."
Apple Bloom says: "I guess I've been pretty worried about gettin' my cutie mark."
Princess Luna says: "Well, that is the same as worrying about who you are."
Princess Luna says: "That is all a cutie mark is."
Princess Luna says: "If you cannot accept who you are, your life might seem like a bad dream."
Apple Bloom says: "But if I like who I am, do you think other ponies will too?"
Princess Luna says: "Of course."
Apple Bloom says: "Then it doesn't matter what my cutie mark is!"
Princess Luna says: "Indeed."
Apple Bloom says: "But that's so simple!"
Apple Bloom says: "I must be the only pony in the universe this worried about her cutie mark."
Princess Luna says: "Oh, I wouldn't say that."
Scootaloo's wings flapping.
Apple Bloom says: "Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle are havin' nightmares too?"
Princess Luna says: "It's been a busy night for us all, but I think it's time to bring it to a close."
Scootaloo says: "Princess Luna!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Princess Luna!"
Princess Luna says: "I know you've all had a lot on your minds tonight, but I think Apple Bloom has something she'd like to share before you wake."
Sweetie Belle says: "We're still asleep?"
Scootaloo says: "Cool!"
Apple Bloom says: "Well, I guess I should call this dream meeting of the Cutie Mark Crusaders to order!"
Apple Bloom says: "I know we all got pretty anxious when we found out Babs got her cutie mark, but I for one don't want to have nightmares every night from now until we get ours!"
Scootaloo says: "Me neither!"
Apple Bloom says: "And even though we're all a little scared, a cutie mark won't change who we are or how everypony feels about us!"
Sweetie Belle says: "It's lucky we're all scared of the same things."
Sweetie Belle says: "That way we can help and remind each other to just be who we are!"
Princess Luna says: "And when the day comes that you all finally get your cutie marks, you can be sure they'll fit you to a T."
Apple Bloom says: "Exactly!"
Scootaloo says: "Do you fillies think that Babs is worried or scared about some of this stuff?"
Apple Bloom says: "I know!"
Apple Bloom says: "Let's put together a care package for her!"
Sweetie Belle says: "That way she'll know she isn't alone!"
Apple Bloom says: "We wouldn't want her to think that just because she isn't a Crusader, we can't still be friends!"
Apple Bloom says: "But, uh..."
Apple Bloom says: "maybe we should wait 'til we wake up."
Princess Luna says: "Good idea."
Applejack.
There ain't no call to worry.
So don't you cry or fret.
Apple Bloom.
A cutie mark won't change me.
No matter what I get.
Applejack says: "Well, sure looks like somepony's feelin' better."
Apple Bloom says: "You have no idea."
Applejack says: "See, now what did I tell you?"
Applejack says: "A good night's sleep cures just about everythin'."
Apple Bloom says: "I guess so."
Apple Bloom says: "I just wish it hadn't been so exhaustin'."
