Meadow Song says: "Puh-leeeez put your hooves together for your next performer, Maud Pie!"
Maud Pie says: "What do you call an Alicorn with no wings and no horn?"
Maud Pie says: "Earth pony."
Maud Pie says: "But seriously, being an Earth pony isn't so bad."
Maud Pie says: "We've got magic powers, too."
Maud Pie says: "Like walking around and picking stuff up with our teeth."
Maud Pie says: "That's sarcasm, by the way."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's funny, 'cause it's true!"
Maud Pie says: "My favorite thing to listen to is clastic rock – the accumulation of sediments over millennia forming to create sandstone, shale, and breccia."
Maud Pie says: "It sounds something like this."
Maud Pie says: "And that's my time."
Pinkie Pie says: "Isn't my sister Maud the most hilarious, entertaining, amazing comedian ever?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Your jokes, your hilarious delivery, your..."
Pinkie Pie says: "your everything!"
Maud Pie says: "How was my..."
Maud Pie says: "timing?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You got me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "C'mon, let's celebrate sister-style."
Pinkie Pie says: "We can get matching stickers that says "Eyes on the Pies", then show them off at the Ponyville Sticker Convention that I could plan for tomorrow if you want."
Maud Pie says: "Actually, I'm busy tonight."
Pinkie Pie says: "Aww, that's what you said yesterday."
Pinkie Pie says: "And the day before that."
Pinkie Pie says: "And the day before the day before that."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's just, we haven't hung out in a really long time because you always have other plans."
Pinkie Pie says: "Even when you promised to build whipped-cream pyramids with me."
Maud Pie says: "I know."
Maud Pie says: "I am sorry, Pinkie."
Maud Pie says: "The reason is I have a—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Apology accepted, as long as we get some serious sister time before your birthday."
Pinkie Pie says: "And there's, uh, definitely no reason I wanna hang out before your birthday."
Pinkie Pie says: "Just, you know, not planning anything special."
Maud Pie says: "Okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "What about tomorrow morning?"
Maud Pie says: "Okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yay!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Just you and me."
Pinkie Pie says: "Best sister friends forever!"
Maud Pie says: "Best sister friends forever."
Pinkie Pie says: "I can't wait for tomorrow to be today."
Pinkie Pie says: "Tomorrow is today!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Who's ready for some fun times at Sugarcube Corner?"
Pinkie Pie says: "The answer is "you"!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I would also accept "Maud"."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, I get it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We're playing hide-and-go-seek!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Aha!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Found you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Where's Maud?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I've already tried Discord's dimension, Granny Smith's wax museum, and Yakyakistan!"
Pinkie Pie says: "She has to be here!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Nope, it's just me."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Reading."
Pinkie Pie says: "Story checks out."
Pinkie Pie says: "Or does it?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It does."
Pinkie Pie says: "But are you sure there's nopony hiding..."
Pinkie Pie says: "in your closet?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Pinkie, I don't have a closet."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Is everything okay?"
Pinkie Pie says: "No."
Pinkie Pie says: "I was supposed to go birthday cake shopping with Maud today."
Starlight Glimmer says: "And ruin her surprise party?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I wasn't gonna tell her why, silly."
Pinkie Pie says: "But now I can't even find Maud."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm usually way better at hide-and-seek than this."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Oh, she probably just found a new rock formation and forgot you two were gonna hang out."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Tell ya what."
Starlight Glimmer says: "You take care of the cake, and I'll look for Maud."
Pinkie Pie says: "Really?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Thanks, Starlight!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Just checking."
Pinkie Pie says: "I've gotta get very important ingredients for a very important pony's cake."
Pinkie Pie says: "And it's gotta be tippy-top super-duper secret."
Mudbriar says: "Technically, it's not your turn yet."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm sorry."
Pinkie Pie says: "Didn't mean to cut in front of anypony."
Pinkie Pie says: "Um, whatcha doin'?"
Mudbriar says: "I am currently speaking to a pony at a baking supply shop two minutes before it closes for lunch."
Pinkie Pie says: "Rrrrrright."
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "Just that I'm trying to plan a party here, and the clock is ticking, while you, uh..."
Pinkie Pie says: "What are you doing anyway?"
Mudbriar says: "I am currently speaking to a—"
Pinkie Pie says: "I mean, can I help you move this along?"
Pinkie Pie says: "What are you looking for?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Rolling pins, cupcake tins, cookie cutters with tails and fins?"
Mudbriar says: "Goodbye."
Pinkie Pie says: "That's what you've been standing here all this time to say?"
Mudbriar says: "I was deciding between "goodbye" and "see you later"."
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh..."
Pinkie Pie says: "but, they're the same thing."
Mudbriar says: "Technically, they're very different."
Mudbriar says: ""See you later" implies an event in the near future wherein we see each other."
Mudbriar says: ""Goodbye" expresses good wishes where parting or at the end of a conversation."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yyyyyeah, same thing."
Mudbriar says: "I will not apologize for speaking with precision."
Pinkie Pie says: "In that case, apology not accepted."
Pinkie Pie says: "Goodbye, later, see ya—"
Pinkie Pie says: "same thing!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ugh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Can you believe that guy?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Huh?"
Pinkie Pie says: ""Out to Lunch"?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, come on!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No Maud, no cake, no anything!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And how annoying was that pony?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Who takes so long to say goodbye?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Or was it "see ya later"?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ugh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Now he's got me doing it!"
Maud Pie says: "Hello, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Found you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "My turn to hide!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hee-hee!"
Maud Pie says: "I'm sorry I wasn't around this morning."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, pssh."
Pinkie Pie says: "What are you apologizing to me for?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm not upset, you silly-willy."
Maud Pie says: "The reason is I met somepony—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wanna hang out right now?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I mean, I can see you're not doing anything with anypony else."
Pinkie Pie says: "Unless they're invisible or reeeeeaaaally small."
Maud Pie says: "Pinkie, the reason I've been so busy is that I have a boyfriend now."
Pinkie Pie says: "A wha..."
Pinkie Pie says: "?"
Maud Pie says: "A boyfriend."
Pinkie Pie says: "A whaaa..."
Pinkie Pie says: "?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Maud Pie says: "A boyfriend."
Pinkie Pie says: "A whaaaaa..."
Pinkie Pie says: "?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Maud Pie says: "A boyfriend."
Pinkie Pie says: "That's so exciting!"
Pinkie Pie says: "My sister, in love!"
Maud Pie says: "Technically, we're in "like"."
Pinkie Pie says: "Tell me everything!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Who is he?"
Pinkie Pie says: "What's his favorite color?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Does he like ice cream?"
Pinkie Pie says: "If he were a bird, what kind of bird would he be?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait."
Pinkie Pie says: "Is he actually a bird?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I don't know, because you haven't told me anything yet!"
Maud Pie says: "You'll like him."
Maud Pie says: "We have a lot in common."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, I love you, so I know I'm gonna love your boyfriend!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, I can't wait to meet him!"
Maud Pie says: "You don't have to."
Pinkie Pie says: "Is Boulder jealous?"
Maud Pie says: "No."
Maud Pie says: "Behind the rock."
Maud Pie says: "Mudbriar, are you back there?"
Mudbriar says: "Technically, not anymore."
Pinkie Pie says: "A wha-whaaaaaaaaa?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Maud Pie says: "Pinkie Pie, meet Mudbriar."
Mudbriar says: "Technically, we've already met."
Pinkie Pie says: "You?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Mudbriar says: "M'yes."
Pinkie Pie says: "You?"
Mudbriar says: "M'yes."
Pinkie Pie says: "You..."
Mudbriar says: "M'yes."
Pinkie Pie says: "I mean,  you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You, you, you!"
Mudbriar says: "M'yes."
Mudbriar says: "M'yes."
Mudbriar says: "M'yes."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm sorry."
Pinkie Pie says: "Let's start over."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hi, I'm Maud's sister, Pinkie Pie."
Mudbriar says: "I know."
Pinkie Pie says: "Sooooo..."
Pinkie Pie says: "how did..."
Pinkie Pie says: "you two meet?"
Maud Pie says: "At a rock show."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You're into rocks, too?"
Mudbriar says: "No."
Mudbriar says: "I like sticks."
Pinkie Pie says: "Then why were you at a rock show?"
Mudbriar says: "It was a petrified wood show, which technically makes it a stick show."
Maud Pie says: "Except that in the per-mineralization process of petrification, all organic material is replaced with silicates – i."
Maud Pie says: "e."
Maud Pie says: ", rocks."
Mudbriar says: "While retaining the original structural elements of wood – q."
Mudbriar says: "e."
Mudbriar says: "d."
Mudbriar says: ", it was a stick show."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm..."
Pinkie Pie says: "really into sticks, too!"
Pinkie Pie says: "They're great for hitting piñatas!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Haaaaa..."
Maud Pie says: "Pinkie..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You wanna go first?"
Mudbriar says: "That is stick abuse."
Pinkie Pie says: "It is?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm sorry."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, this is awful."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm not being a very good sister."
Pinkie Pie says: "Let's start over."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm Pinkie Pie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Nice to meet you!"
Mudbriar says: "Technically, we've already met."
Maud Pie says: "You should introduce Pinkie to your pet."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Your pet likes fetch!"
Mudbriar says: "This is my pet."
Mudbriar says: "So no."
Maud Pie says: "Aw."
Maud Pie says: "Look at Twiggy and Boulder playing together."
Mudbriar says: "They're adorable."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's just a stick."
Maud Pie says: "Don't be rude."
Pinkie Pie says: "Nice to meet you!"
Mudbriar says: "Technically, we've already met."
Pinkie Pie says: "Daaah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I don't get this guy!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Wow."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Maud has a boyfriend?"
Pinkie Pie says: "How could she like someone so weird?"
Pinkie Pie says: "He has an inanimate object for a pet!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "So does Maud."
Pinkie Pie says: "Boulder has ten times the personality of some random stick!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Mudbriar, too, for that matter."
Pinkie Pie says: "He's not like Maud at all!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud is hilarious, friendly, caring, and easy to talk to!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Yep, that's Maud."
Pinkie Pie says: "But this guy is awkward, quiet, and kind of..."
Pinkie Pie says: "strange."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Uh, that also sounds like Maud."
Pinkie Pie says: "You're so funny, Starlight!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud is nothing like Mudbriar."
Pinkie Pie says: "If she were, then we wouldn't be best sister friends forever."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Well, Maud obviously likes something about him."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Maybe you just need to spend more time with him."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Find out what you have in common."
Pinkie Pie says: "That's easy – nothing!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "You both care about Maud."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I know."
Starlight Glimmer says: "He could help you with her party."
Pinkie Pie says: "I guess..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "And I'll keep Maud busy while you and Mudbriar plan the best surprise birthday ever."
Pinkie Pie says: "That I can do!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Listen."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud's birthday is tomorrow, and there's no time to waste."
Pinkie Pie says: "You're not afraid of slides, are you?"
Mudbriar says: "No."
Mudbriar says: "Whyyyyyyyyyyy??!"
Mudbriar says: "!"
Mudbriar says: "Oof!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No reason."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wheeeeeee!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Welcome to my party planning cave!"
Mudbriar says: "Technically, due to the speleothems growing from the ceiling, this is more of a cavern than a cave."
Mudbriar says: "Maud taught me that."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah, okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "Here's what I'm thinking for her surprise party – edible rock candy plates, gem-shaped ice cubes, a pebble piñata."
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh..."
Pinkie Pie says: "we'll skip that one."
Mudbriar says: "Might I make some suggestions?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh."
Pinkie Pie says: "Suggest away!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's why you're here!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You and me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Planning..."
Pinkie Pie says: "together!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Friends!"
Mudbriar says: "I have a vision board of everything Maud loves, and none of those things are on it."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hmph."
Pinkie Pie says: "Let me see this "vision board"."
Mudbriar says: "It's not a physical thing."
Mudbriar says: "I'm envisioning it."
Mudbriar says: "Just as I thought."
Mudbriar says: "Maud doesn't like surprises."
Pinkie Pie says: "Where does it say that?"
Pinkie Pie says: "She never told me that!"
Mudbriar says: "Mmm."
Mudbriar says: "It sounds like she was protecting your feelings."
Mudbriar says: "She's very caring that way."
Pinkie Pie says: "Stop acting like you know my sister better than me!"
Mudbriar says: "Technically, I never said that."
Pinkie Pie says: "But we have to be super-sneaky."
Mudbriar says: "Can you be more specific?"
Pinkie Pie says: "No!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Huh."
Starlight Glimmer says: "You must be Mudbriar."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I'm Starlight Glimmer."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Nice to meet you."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I've heard great things!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I'm so glad the two of you are spending time together."
Starlight Glimmer says: "So..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "how's it going?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Mudbriar and I have just spent the best time bonding!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And we're really starting to make some headway becoming besties, except for one teensy-weensy disagreement that maybe you could settle, Maud."
Pinkie Pie says: "See, Mudbriar here seems to think that  wrong he is?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Maud Pie says: "I like surprise parties..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hmmmm."
Maud Pie says: "..."
Maud Pie says: "because I know they make you happy when you throw them for me."
Pinkie Pie says: "See?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait, what?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Maud Pie says: "I'd rather just do something small with you, Starlight, Boulder, and Mudbriar for my birthday."
Pinkie Pie says: "No party?"
Pinkie Pie says: "No party?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Did he put you up to this?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Maud Pie says: "Mm-mm."
Pinkie Pie says: "impossible to like?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Hey, Mudbriar, have you ever flown a kite?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Let me tell you all about it."
Starlight Glimmer says: "See, the first thing you should do is—"
Pinkie Pie says: "I just can't believe you would choose sitting around with him over a party with your own sister!"
Maud Pie says: "I didn't choose either of you."
Maud Pie says: "Technically, I said I wanted to be with both of you."
Pinkie Pie says: ""Technically"?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ugh, you even like the way he talks?"
Maud Pie says: "Everything about him makes me happy."
Pinkie Pie says: "Then I guess you don't need a best sister friend forever anymore."
Maud Pie says: "Pinkie..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Uh, wait, let's all slow down and talk about this."
Pinkie Pie says: "No!"
Mudbriar says: "See you later!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I don't understand!"
Pinkie Pie says: "How could Maud like Mudbriar?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is it Opposite Day?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Nothing makes sense!"
Fluttershy's apparition says: "I'm not shy, and I hate animals!"
Rarity's apparition says: "Fashion?!"
Rarity's apparition says: "!"
Rarity's apparition says: "Not for me, darling!"
Applejack's apparition says: "Peh!"
Applejack's apparition says: "An apple a day is downright disgusting!"
Rainbow Dash's apparition says: "Slow and steady wins the race!"
Twilight Sparkle's apparition says: "I never learned to read!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What if I don't like cupcakes?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Good morning!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, wait."
Pinkie Pie says: "Bad morning."
Limestone Pie says: "Get out of bed, sis."
Limestone Pie says: "If you're gonna be here, you gotta work."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ohhh."
Pinkie Pie says: "You're probably wondering why I came back to the family farm in the middle of the night."
Marble Pie says: "Mm-hmm."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, it all started when—"
Limestone Pie says: "Less talking, more farming!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's just..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Maud has a boyfriend."
Limestone Pie says: "I'm not jealous!"
Limestone Pie says: "Who said anything about jealous?!"
Limestone Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't be!"
Pinkie Pie says: "He's super-duper weird!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And somehow, he tricked Maud into liking him."
Pinkie Pie says: "And now I'll never get to see her again!"
Limestone Pie says: "Buck up, Pinkie Pie."
Limestone Pie says: "You look as miserable as I feel all the time."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's just that I love Maud, and I want to love Mudbriar, but I can't see anything to like about him!"
Limestone Pie says: "Ugh, fine!"
Limestone Pie says: "We're taking a work break."
Limestone Pie says: "Come on!"
Limestone Pie says: "I'm looking at a sparkling bright blue and white rock."
Limestone Pie says: "See it?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You mean that lumpy grey one?"
Limestone Pie says: "No, the beautiful blue and white one."
Limestone Pie says: "Right there."
Pinkie Pie says: "I would not describe that as beautiful, blue, or white, but..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay."
Limestone Pie says: "Show her."
Limestone Pie says: "It's a geode!"
Limestone Pie says: "The outside looks like a regular rock, but the inside is filled with beautiful gems."
Pinkie Pie says: "So you're saying I should crack open Mudbriar like a rock!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It all makes sense!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No, wait."
Pinkie Pie says: "It doesn't."
Limestone Pie says: "It's a metaphor, Pinkie!"
Limestone Pie says: "You see Mudbriar as a rock, but Maud sees him as a gem."
Limestone Pie says: "Even if you never see past his dullness, you can see how happy he makes Maud."
Limestone Pie says: "And to a sister, that's all that matters."
Marble Pie says: "Mm-hmm!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, Limestone, Marble, thank you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I don't know what I'd do without you two!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pie pile!"
Limestone Pie says: "Okay, okay!"
Limestone Pie says: "You're crushing me to gravel, Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I really owe Mudbriar an apology."
Pinkie Pie says: "And I owe Maud a party!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I just hope I'm not too late!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I brought you an olive branch to say sorry."
Pinkie Pie says: "I was really unfair to you, and I'm ready to listen to your ideas for Maud's birthday, if you still want to plan it together."
Mudbriar says: "Technically, this isn't even an olive branch."
Mudbriar says: "It's a quercus, most likely castaneifolia."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, come on!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Sorry!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Keeping it together..."
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Mudbriar says: "And I love a good quercus."
Mudbriar says: "Friends?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Friends!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Now, do you have any ideas for the party?"
Mudbriar says: "There is one."
Crowd says: "Surprise!"
Background pony 1 says: "Can you believe this punch?"
Background pony 1 says: "Oh, it's so good!"
Background pony 2 says: "Another great party!"
Background pony 3 says: "I know!"
Background pony 4 says: "Yeah!"
Maud Pie says: "This is my favorite party ever."
Pinkie Pie says: "It was all your amazing boyfriend's idea."
Pinkie Pie says: "He said the best present would be me throwing you a surprise party you didn't have to go to."
Mudbriar says: "Technically, it wasn't a surprise because she could see the pre-party preparations from up here."
Pinkie Pie says: "You're right!"
