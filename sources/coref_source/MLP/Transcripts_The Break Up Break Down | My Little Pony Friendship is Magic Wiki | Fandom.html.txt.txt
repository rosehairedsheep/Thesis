Spike says: "You said it, Big Mac."
Spike says: "This is taking forever!"
Spike says: "I know it's wrong to cut corners when it comes to gifts from the heart, but this is an emergency, right?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Spike says: "Discord?"
Spike says: "A little help?"
Spike says: "Discord!"
Spike says: "Yeah?"
Spike says: "Oh!"
Spike says: "Good idea!"
Spike says: "Captain Wuzz!"
Spike says: "Are you prepared to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?"
Discord says: "Huzzah, fellow adventurers!"
Discord says: "Shall we storm the ramparts of Squizard's castle to reclaim Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility?"
Discord says: "You did summon me for a rousing Guys' Night of Ogres & Oubliettes, did you not?"
Spike says: "Uh, sort of."
Spike says: "But do you think you could magically hurry up this pie real quick first?"
Discord says: "You seem to be mixing up  with a second-rate clown magician for hire."
Big McIntosh says: "Eee..."
Big McIntosh says: "wait!"
Spike says: "This needs to go in the mail today, or it'll never get to Sugar Belle in time for Hearts and Hooves Day!"
Discord says: "Please."
Discord says: "Can't you see that that holiday is a commercialized ruse pushed on you by the greeting card industry?"
Discord says: "Fine."
Discord says: "You owe me for this."
Discord says: "Keep your eye on the pie."
Discord says: "It's magic time!"
Discord says: "This smells..."
Discord says: "uh..."
Discord says: "palatable."
Spike says: "Well, pies really are Sugar Belle's thing."
Spike says: "But I think that makes this all the more special."
Spike says: "It shows you're interested in what she cares about."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup!"
Spike says: "And he's planning a big romantic Hearts and Hooves dinner."
Spike says: "It was my idea to bake the invitation inside."
Discord says: ""Happy Hearts and Hooves Day, Sugar Belle."
Discord says: "Meet me in my barn at sunset for a surprise."
Spike says: "Pretty clever, huh?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Discord says: "Ugh."
Spike says: "Awww."
Spike says: ""Sugar Belle"."
Spike says: "See?"
Discord says: "Well, you two certainly have bought into this romance nonsense hook, line, and sinker."
Spike says: "For a formerly friendless immortal despot, you're pretty cynical."
Discord says: "I'm a realist."
Discord says: "And love, like all things warm and fuzzy, isn't real."
Spike says: "Aw, come on."
Spike says: "You act tough, but deep down, you're a softie."
Spike says: "I mean, you don't have tea with Fluttershy every weekend because you like tea."
Discord says: "But I do like tea!"
Discord says: "Every tea!"
Discord says: "All the teas!"
Discord says: "Chamomile, Earl Grey, green, white, yellow, mate, lemon, ginger, chai, spearmint, peppermint, hibiscus..."
Discord says: "..."
Discord says: "cinnamon, pumpkin spice."
Spike says: "Tell you what."
Spike says: "While Big Mac mails his incredibly romantic gesture, I'll show you the splendors of Hearts and Hooves Day in Ponyville."
Spike says: "I bet I can prove you believe in love."
Discord says: "Fine."
Discord says: "Call it a gentleman's wager."
Discord says: "Loser mows my lawn for eternity."
Spike says: "Is it, like, a riding mower or..."
Spike says: "?"
Discord says: "Tweezers!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hear ye, hear ye!"
Apple Bloom says: "This special Hearts and Hooves Day meetin' of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session!"
Apple Bloom says: "First order of business – helpin' my big brother decorate the barn for his big date with Sugar Belle tonight, and..."
Apple Bloom says: "Hello?"
Sweetie Belle says: "It seems like everypony's got somepony special but us."
Scootaloo says: "When's it gonna be our turn?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Huh?"
Scootaloo says: "Huh?"
Apple Bloom says: "Huh?"
Scootaloo says: "Who's it from?"
Apple Bloom says: "Can't tell."
Apple Bloom says: "It's all smudged, but it looks like it's addressed to..."
Apple Bloom says: ""Belle"?"
Apple Bloom says: "Hmmm..."
Sweetie Belle says: ""Sweetie Belle"!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Somepony certainly went through a lot of trouble for me!"
Sweetie Belle says: "On Hearts and Hooves Day!"
Scootaloo says: "You don't think..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Could it be..."
Sweetie Belle says: "?"
Apple Bloom says: "Hang on a minute."
Apple Bloom says: "Mysterious package, smudged address, no idea who it's from..."
Apple Bloom says: "Hm."
Apple Bloom says: "I know what this is."
Apple Bloom says: "You've got a secret admirer!"
Spike says: "Another Hearts and Hooves Day."
Spike says: "Love is in the air, Discord."
Spike says: "Look at all these happy couples."
Discord says: "How can they be happy if they aren't playing Ogres & Oubliettes?"
Spike says: "As a great dragon poet once wrote to his beloved, "I love you with the utmost clarity."
Spike says: "I love you, dear."
Spike says: "My sweet, sweet Rarity—"
Spike says: "" Are you even listening?!"
Spike says: "!"
Discord says: "Of course."
Discord says: ""Love is..."
Discord says: "something-something, and Discord is great."
Discord says: "" I don't know."
Discord says: "Can we play O&O now?"
Spike says: "Sure, after you admit you believe in love and..."
Spike says: "Sugar Belle!"
Spike says: "Big Mac's girlfriend."
Spike says: "What's she doing in town so early?"
Mrs. Cake says: "Well, Sugar Belle, I'm sure Big Mac won't be expecting it."
Spike says: "She's planning her own romantic surprise for Big Mac?"
Spike says: "What if she goes to Sweet Apple Acres before Big Mac's ready with his surprise?"
Spike says: "We've gotta warn him!"
Big McIntosh says: "..."
Big McIntosh says: "ffle, cookin' a souffle..."
Spike says: "Aah!"
Big McIntosh says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "I mean, Big Mac!"
Spike says: "We just saw Sugar Belle!"
Spike says: "She's at Sugarcube Corner!"
Spike says: "But I think she's on her way over here now!"
Spike says: "You gotta keep her away from here until the barn's finished!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup!"
Spike says: "I wonder what she has planned for him."
Spike says: "Aah!"
Spike says: "Ugh!"
Spike says: "Will you warn me next time you do that?"
Mrs. Cake says: "Just be honest with him."
Mrs. Cake says: "I'm sure Big Mac will..."
Spike says: "Ohhhh."
Spike says: "She hasn't seen him yet."
Spike says: "Take note, Discord."
Spike says: "This is what love is all about."
Discord says: ""Spike – Love is about spying in the bushes."
Spike says: "Make fun of me all you want."
Spike says: "But look at Big Mac's face and tell me you don't believe in love."
Sugar Belle says: "I hope he'll be okay without me."
Spike says: "Oh."
Spike says: "Hey."
Spike says: "We're just..."
Spike says: "not spying—"
Big McIntosh says: "Hush!"
Sugar Belle says: "I mean, he has been on his own before."
Sugar Belle says: "So he'll be fine, right?"
Sugar Belle says: "How should I tell Big Mac tonight?"
Sugar Belle says: ""You won't need to come visit me in my village anymore"?"
Sugar Belle says: ""We need to talk."
Mrs. Cake says: "Just be honest with him."
Sugar Belle says: "You're right."
Sugar Belle says: "Okay!"
Sugar Belle says: ""We're finished."
Discord says: "You're right."
Discord says: "She did surprise him."
Spike says: "Ugh."
Spike says: "Okay."
Spike says: "Things seem bad."
Spike says: "Maybe they're really not."
Spike says: "Maybe "we're finished" was about the day."
Spike says: "Ponies say that, right?"
Spike says: "Like-like, "Hey, remember yesterday?"
Spike says: "That's finished, 'cause it's today!"
Spike says: "Maybe not that."
Spike says: "Oh, I know!"
Spike says: "Maybe Sugar Belle has a wacky cousin who's never been on his own, and she has to leave him in charge of her shop while she apprentices with Mrs."
Spike says: "Cake, who does that, like, two days a week."
Spike says: "N-No, no, three."
Spike says: "That's why she won't need you to come to her village anymore, because..."
Spike says: "she'll already be here!"
Spike says: "Nah."
Spike says: "I don't even buy that one."
Discord says: "Oh, I hate seeing you like this, Big Mac."
Discord says: "And over a girl, no less."
Discord says: "I'm calling an emergency Guys' Night  right now to cheer you up."
Discord says: "Besides, we can't have you ruining any more of my thousand-year-old monogrammed handkerchiefs."
Discord says: "These are silk, you know."
Discord says: "Class is now in session."
Discord says: "Lesson one – nothing can break your heart if you only love yourself."
Discord says: "You've got to show everypony that you're too cool to be bothered with so-called love."
Discord says: "Observe."
Discord says: "This is how cool guys lean against things."
Discord says: "When you see a guy leaning against a thing looking this cool, you think, "Wow!"
Discord says: "That guy doesn't have a care in Equestria."
Discord says: "Not a guy who leans on things that cool."
Spike says: "I don't think leaning's gonna help."
Spike says: "Am I doing it right?"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "We're not like you, Discord."
Spike says: "We can't put on a front and pretend not to love."
Spike says: "It's impossible."
Discord says: "Lesson two – plenty of ponies in the pasture."
Discord says: "Right, Big Mac?"
Discord says: "I know just the gal to make you forget all about Sugar Belle."
Big McIntosh says: "You..."
Big McIntosh says: "said..."
Big McIntosh says: "her..."
Big McIntosh says: "naaaaaaame!"
Discord says: "Oy vey..."
Apple Bloom says: "Okay."
Apple Bloom says: "We finished decoratin' the barn for Big Mac, which means we got the rest of the day to ourselves."
Apple Bloom says: "There's a whole town of possible admirers out there and only three of us."
Apple Bloom says: "But together, we're gonna get to the bottom of this!"
Apple Bloom says: "Ready?"
Apple Bloom says: "Break!"
Apple Bloom says: "Excuse me!"
Apple Bloom says: "Pipsqueak?"
Apple Bloom says: "Mind answerin' a few questions?"
Apple Bloom says: "No?"
Apple Bloom says: "Late for somethin'?"
Apple Bloom says: "Are you Sweetie Belle's secret admirer?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "Excuse me!"
Scootaloo says: "I'm doing a research survey about sending pie in the mail anonymously."
Scootaloo says: "Would you say you're pro-that or anti-that?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Please say no, please say no, please say no."
Discord says: "Sir McBigguns, meet Skellinore."
Discord says: "She's a Level 18 Bone Warrior in Squizard's mage army, but only to pay off skeleton student loan debts."
Discord says: "Get to know each other, why don't you?"
Spike says: "Wow."
Spike says: "You're really going all out to cheer up Big Mac."
Spike says: "I'm impressed."
Discord says: "Yes, yes, I'm amazing."
Discord says: "Anyway, since we're in the neighborhood, care for a quick game of Ogres & Oubliettes?"
Discord says: "Like I've been wanting to play all week?!"
Discord says: "!"
Spike says: "I take it back."
Discord says: "I'm helping our friend first and foremost."
Discord says: "See for yourself."
Spike says: "I think he's showing her a picture of Sugar Belle."
Discord says: "What?"
Spike says: "And now he's crying."
Discord says: "No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no."
Discord says: "No, he's not."
Discord says: "Let me see that."
Spike says: "Don't touch it!"
Spike says: "I'm looking!"
Discord says: "Give me that!"
Spike says: "Cut it out!"
Spike says: "Discord, quit it!"
Big McIntosh says: "She used to do this thing where her-her nose would wrinkle when she laughed."
Big McIntosh says: "Right there, in that hole where your nose used to be."
Big McIntosh says: "I never told her how much I loved wrinkle-nose cutie-face..."
Big McIntosh says: "and now I never will!"
Discord says: "Ugh."
Spike says: "Okay."
Spike says: "I think we've had enough of the aloof master of chaos remedies for a broken heart."
Spike says: "You know what I do when I have a problem too big to solve?"
Spike says: "I hide from it!"
Spike says: "When she can't find you, she'll realize how much she misses you."
Spike says: "Plus, if she can't find you, she can't break up with you."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Big McIntosh says: "Hup!"
Spike says: "Ha!"
Scootaloo says: "I don't get it."
Scootaloo says: "We asked every stallion in Ponyville."
Apple Bloom says: "There's gotta be somepony we're missin'."
Apple Bloom says: "Somepony obvious."
Apple Bloom says: "Somepony right in front of our noses."
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh, well."
Sweetie Belle says: "At least the barn's looking great for Big Mac's date."
Discord says: "Too bad there won't be a date."
Sweetie Belle says: "Sugar Belle is so lucky to have a non-secret admirer like Big Mac."
Discord says: "Well, she certainly doesn't seem to have appreciated it."
Apple Bloom says: "I bet she's gonna take one look at this barn and say, "What did I ever do to deserve this?"
Discord says: "Yes, what did she do to deserve this?"
Big McIntosh says: "She broke my heart."
Discord says: "Well, not yet, technically."
Discord says: "In fact, she can't break your heart if you break hers first."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup!"
Sugar Belle says: "Thanks for the tour of Ponyville, Mrs."
Sugar Belle says: "Cake."
Mrs. Cake says: "Oh, my pleasure."
Sugar Belle says: "I'm off to surprise Big Mac with the news."
Sugar Belle says: "Imagine the look on his face when I tell him, "We need to talk."
Mrs. Cake says: "Oh, dear me, no!"
Mrs. Cake says: "I told you, don't say it that way or he'll think you're breaking up with him."
Sugar Belle says: "Break up with him?"
Sugar Belle says: "Never!"
Sugar Belle says: "Why, without my favorite delivery pony, I couldn't imagine being happy ever again."
Sugar Belle says: "He knows that."
Mrs. Cake says: "Good!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Save your mix-up for cake batter – that's what I always say!"
Sugar Belle says: "He's a good listener, that pony."
Sugar Belle says: "I promise you, no mix-ups."
Sugar Belle says: "Ah!"
Sugar Belle says: "Big Mac!"
Big McIntosh says: "Sugar Belle..."
Big McIntosh says: "we need to talk."
Big McIntosh says: "I know why you're here."
Sugar Belle says: "You do?"
Big McIntosh says: "But I have somethin' to tell you first."
Sugar Belle says: "Oh, can I go first?"
Sugar Belle says: "I'm gonna be—"
Big McIntosh says: "Stop."
Sugar Belle says: "Oh."
Sugar Belle says: "Why don't we tell each other on three?"
Sugar Belle says: "One—"
Big McIntosh says: "It's over!"
Sugar Belle says: "What's over?"
Big McIntosh says: "You and me."
Big McIntosh says: "It's over."
Sugar Belle says: "Ah..."
Sugar Belle says: "What?"
Big McIntosh says: "We're breakin' up!"
Sugar Belle says: "I..."
Sugar Belle says: "don't understand."
Sugar Belle says: "Why are you breaking up with me?"
Sugar Belle says: "And why are you leaning like that?"
Big McIntosh says: "I..."
Big McIntosh says: "don't know!"
Sugar Belle says: "Big Mac, please."
Sugar Belle says: "Talk to me."
Big McIntosh says: "I..."
Big McIntosh says: "You..."
Big McIntosh says: "This is why I don't like talkin'!"
Big McIntosh says: "Words can hurt!"
Big McIntosh says: "Words hurt!"
Big McIntosh says: "Goodbye, Sugar Belle!"
Apple Bloom says: "Big Mac!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, thank goodness!"
Apple Bloom says: "You gotta help us with this."
Spike says: "Ugh."
Spike says: "Dude, how long have you been not hiding?"
Discord says: "Oh."
Discord says: "I should probably have said something."
Big McIntosh says: "Y'all should go."
Spike says: "Did ya..."
Spike says: "?"
Spike says: "Did she..."
Spike says: "?"
Spike says: "Are ya..."
Spike says: "?"
Apple Bloom says: "Big Mac, what's goin' on?"
Apple Bloom says: "Where's Sugar Belle?"
Big McIntosh says: "Just go!"
Sweetie Belle says: "But we worked so hard on this chart."
Sweetie Belle says: "I think we've almost cracked it."
Sweetie Belle says: "If you could just—"
Big McIntosh says: "Not right now!"
Sweetie Belle says: "But I can't stand having a secret admirer who's too scared to tell me who he is!"
Big McIntosh says: "Maybe he doesn't like talkin'!"
Sweetie Belle says: "But that doesn't make any sense!"
Big McIntosh says: "Maybe he used to talk too much, and it only ever got him into trouble!"
Spike says: "What if you're right, Discord?"
Spike says: "What if love isn't real at all?"
Big McIntosh says: "I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle."
Big McIntosh says: "I'm just mad, and I'm takin' it out on you."
Sweetie Belle says: "That's okay."
Sweetie Belle says: "I bet it felt good to get it out though."
Big McIntosh says: "Actually, it did."
Big McIntosh says: "Tellin' you how I felt just then..."
Big McIntosh says: "I gotta go!"
Spike says: "Big Mac!"
Spike says: "Where are ya goin'?"
Big McIntosh says: "I gotta talk to Sugar Belle!"
Spike says: "Discord, you gotta use your magic and..."
Spike says: "!"
Spike says: "Guess you have better things to do."
Spike says: "Big Mac's gonna need a miracle."
Sugar Belle says: "Oh."
Sugar Belle says: "All the rotten luck..."
Big McIntosh says: "Caught ya just in time!"
Big McIntosh says: "We both know I don't like to say much, but I'm gonna say somethin' now."
Big McIntosh says: "Even though I'm hurtin', I wouldn't trade this feelin' for anythin'."
Big McIntosh says: "Because it'd mean givin' up the good times we had, too."
Big McIntosh says: "I only broke up with you because you were gonna break up with me."
Big McIntosh says: "I respect your decision, and you should know you'll always be in my heart."
Sugar Belle says: "I didn't want to break up with you."
Big McIntosh says: "But..."
Big McIntosh says: "you said you didn't need me to visit anymore."
Big McIntosh says: "You said I'm gonna be on my own."
Big McIntosh says: "I-I heard you said "we're finished" when I was hidin' in the bushes."
Big McIntosh says: "That sounds worse than it is."
Sugar Belle says: "Oh, Big Mac!"
Sugar Belle says: "I was talking about my cousin!"
Sugar Belle says: "I have this wacky cousin who's never been on his own, but I have to let him run my shop on weekends."
Sugar Belle says: "Which is why you won't be delivering to my village anymore because I'll already be here apprenticing with Mrs."
Sugar Belle says: "Cake, who does that two days a week."
Sugar Belle says: "No, three."
Big McIntosh says: "Wait 'til I tell Spike!"
Sugar Belle says: "I'd never break up with you!"
Sugar Belle says: "I suppose there's a lesson here somewhere about communication, talking instead of assuming, or eavesdropping is wrong."
Sugar Belle says: "Wouldn't you say?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeeeyup!"
Big McIntosh says: "Hee-hee."
Big McIntosh says: "Wrinkle-nose cutie-face."
Big McIntosh says: "You must've been awful confused at my breakin' up with you after you got my pie."
Sugar Belle says: "What pie?"
Big McIntosh says: "You didn't get the pie I sent?"
Sugar Belle says: "Mm-mm."
Big McIntosh says: "Or the invitation?"
Sugar Belle says: "Uh-uh."
Big McIntosh says: "Well, in that case..."
Big McIntosh says: "allow me to escort you to a Hearts and Hooves Day surprise!"
Apple Bloom says: "Mind if we join ya?"
Sweetie Belle says: ""Happy Hearts and Hooves Day, Sugar Belle."
Sweetie Belle says: "Meet me—"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Sugar Belle?!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "You have got to be pulling our hooves!"
Sweetie Belle says: "It was all a mix-up?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh, it's funny."
Sweetie Belle says: "I've been sitting here feeling sorry for myself for not having a special pony on Hearts and Hooves Day."
Sweetie Belle says: "But remembering all the fun we had, I think I have two special ponies – my two best friends."
Apple Bloom says: "Awwwww..."
Scootaloo says: "Awwwww..."
Spike says: "And so ends another Hearts and Hooves Day."
Spike says: "Despite a bumpy start..."
Spike says: "and middle..."
Spike says: "and ending..."
Spike says: "lot of bumps today..."
Spike says: "love was in the air."
Discord says: "So was confusion, apparently, and a fair number of assumptions."
Spike says: "But you have to admit, after seeing everything Big Mac went through, love is a hundred percent real."
Spike says: "Seriously?!"
Spike says: "!"
Spike says: "Discord, come on!"
Spike says: "I can't believe you!"
Discord says: "Who do you think broke Sugar Belle's wagon wheel?"
Discord says: "Ta-da!"
Discord says: "Happy Hearts and Hooves Day!"
Spike says: "You old softie."
Spike says: "I knew you had a heart."
Discord says: "Speaking of how great I am, are you busy for the rest of the night?"
Discord says: "Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility isn't going to reclaim itself, you know."
Spike says: "Ogres & Oubliettes?"
Spike says: "I thought you'd never ask!"
Spike says: "Oh, and..."
Spike says: "just wondering."
Spike says: "No biggie, but..."
Spike says: "is Skellinore gonna be there?"
Discord says: "Spike, she's an imaginary one-dimensional paper cutout skeleton."
Spike says: "Well, nopony's perfect."
