Nurse Redheart says: "Oh, Princess Twilight!"
Nurse Redheart says: "Everypony in the hospital is so excited for your visit today!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm never too busy to visit sick foals."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can't believe a whole class just came down with the horsey hives!"
Nurse Redheart says: "On school picture day, too."
Nurse Redheart says: "Oh, the poor dears really do need cheering up."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We'll do our best."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We'll bring snacks, I'll read to them, and get them gifts!"
Spike says: "Food and presents always cheer me up."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We'll see you soon!"
Spike says: "Okay, if we want to be at the hospital by lunch, then we have three hours to buy get-well presents, borrow a book from the schoolhouse,  and pick up treats."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's a lot, but if we stick to the schedule, I know we can get it all done."
Spike says: "Yeah, knock on wood."
Shining Armor says: "Surprise!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, my gosh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "How's my favorite niece?"
Shining Armor says: ""I'm good!"
Shining Armor says: "I was hoping my favowite aunt could watch me for a few houwrs."
Princess Cadance says: "Hope you're not too busy."
Spike says: "Actually, we kind of are—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Busy?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Would the best aunt ever be too busy to spend time with this adorable little one?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Flurry!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've got a surprise for you!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Just a couple of toys that reminded me of Flurry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm excited to show you I've done some shopping for Flurry Heart."
Princess Cadance says: "Oh-ho-ho, you're so sweet."
Princess Cadance says: "You didn't have to do all that."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know, but I can't help myself!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Best aunt ever!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Open this one, Flurry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Exactly!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "They're bears!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're one smart cookie."
Shining Armor says: "We'll just put Flurry's things over here, Twily!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh-huh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Totally."
Shining Armor says: "Mashed peas, her favorite."
Princess Cadance says: "And diapers."
Princess Cadance says: "Uh, extra diapers."
Princess Cadance says: "Oh, and backup extra diapers."
Princess Cadance says: "Heh."
Shining Armor says: "Mashed peas, her favorite."
Shining Armor says: "Wait, did I say that already?"
Spike says: "Uh-huh."
Shining Armor says: "Oops."
Princess Cadance says: "Oh, and this is the most important thing of all – her Whammy."
Spike says: "I take it Flurry named it?"
Princess Cadance says: "Yup."
Princess Cadance says: "If she gets fussy, just give her the Whammy and she'll calm right down."
Shining Armor says: "You getting all this, Twily?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Whammy."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Got it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where are you guys headed, anyway?"
Shining Armor says: "You remember my friend from the royal guard, Spearhead?"
Spike says: "Honestly, all of your friends' names are very similar."
Shining Armor says: "Well, he has a pop-up art show at the Ponyville Cafe, and we decided to go at the last minute."
Princess Cadance says: "We're not exactly art enthusiasts, but we could really use a night out."
Spike says: "You mean "day"?"
Princess Cadance says: "That's what I said!"
Princess Cadance says: "Isn't that what I said?"
Spike says: "Mmm..."
Spike says: "Mm-mm."
Princess Cadance says: "Either way, are you sure you can watch her?"
Spike says: "Uh-uh-uh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Mmmmh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Have no fear!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The best aunt ever has everything under control!"
Shining Armor says: "Thanks again, Twily."
Spike says: "Okay, let's grab that Whummy thing and go."
Flurry Heart says: "Uh-uh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, you want to pretend we're the bears."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I suppose we have time for a quick game."
Spike says: "Do we, though?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "All right!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm gonna get ya!"
Spike says: "Ugh!"
Spike says: "You should catch her soon, 'cause we've got lots to do!"
Spike says: "Horsey-hives-covered foals counting on us, remember?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Got it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm catching up!"
Flurry Heart says: "Huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh-oh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sorry, bug."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Did that scare you?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's okay."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's just Auntie Twily!"
Flurry Heart says: "Bleh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You know, that was a very advanced spell for somepony your age."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Looks like you're already taking after your Auntie Twily."
Spike says: "All right, that was pretty adorable."
Spike says: "But now..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know, Spike, we're leaving."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I just have to feed her real quick."
Shining Armor says: "Is this art or..."
Shining Armor says: "a mistake?"
Princess Cadance says: "I have no idea."
Princess Cadance says: "But who cares?"
Princess Cadance says: "We're not changing diapers."
Spearhead says: "Shining Armor!"
Spearhead says: "Cadance!"
Spearhead says: "How are the new 'rents?"
Spearhead says: "Gimme some hoof."
Spearhead says: "Oh, it is so  to see you dudes!"
Spearhead says: "Hey, thanks for coming."
Shining Armor says: "Of course!"
Shining Armor says: "We're having a great time!"
Shining Armor says: "Loving all the..."
Shining Armor says: "art!"
Spearhead says: "Uh, that's a trash can."
Shining Armor says: "So it is!"
Shining Armor says: "I knew that!"
Spearhead says: "But hey, who's to say it's not art?"
Spearhead says: "Art can be anything that speaks to you."
Spearhead says: "It changed my world."
Spearhead says: "This is my latest piece – "A Thousand Nights in a Hallway"."
Princess Cadance says: "Wow, I guess nighttime in a hallway can be pretty dark."
Spearhead says: "There is none more dark."
Shining Armor says: "Yeah."
Shining Armor says: "Totally."
Princess Cadance says: "We're just so happy to be here."
Princess Cadance says: "Usually we're covered in mashed peas by now."
Spike says: "When they said mashed peas were her favorite..."
Spike says: "..."
Spike says: "did they mean her favorite thing to decorate a room with?!"
Spike says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Aw, come on, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That wasn't too bad."
Spike says: "Yeah, and we're only twenty minutes behind schedule."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Twenty minutes?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's fine."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We can totally do this."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, we just need to grab some toys and we are outta here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You want to play, don't you?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, I know a game that's even more fun!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Playing race carts!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ha-ha!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Woo-hoo!"
Spike says: "Hey, nice thinking, Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Best aunt ever!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hang on, Flurry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The race cart's taking a pit stop."
Spike says: "I'm not a detective, but I think we got a suspect."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Huh?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, we'd better get to cleaning."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We've got no time to waste!"
Salespony says: "Thanks, but they were organized by color."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We gained back a whole five minutes from running here!"
Spike says: "Yeah, but if you add that to the forty minutes we were already behind..."
Spike says: "we're still..."
Spike says: "fifty five minutes behind!"
Spike says: "I mean..."
Spike says: "Yay, team?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Mm-hmm!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thanks for helping us out, Cheerilee."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sorry we were late."
Cheerilee says: "Oh, no problem."
Cheerilee says: "But I gotta say, I'm surprised you came to me for a book."
Cheerilee says: "Don't you have a huge collection?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes, but—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sorry, one second."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I didn't think the foals would be interested in The Unabridged History of Amulets in pony Latin."
Cheerilee says: "Yeah, it was good you came to me."
Cheerilee says: "How about the complete collection of Ponyville Fables and Stables?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Mmm, too long."
Cheerilee says: "Alien Alicorns vs."
Cheerilee says: "Space Pirates?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, the science there is preposterous—"
Spike says: "How about Burnferno, Warrior from Within?"
Spike says: "It's about a handsome dragon warrior who slays evildoers with his breath and his snappy comebacks!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's borrow that for you and keep looking."
Spike says: "Eh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What else?"
Whammy squeaks.
Cheerilee says: "Uh, how about Gusty the Great?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ooh, that was one of my favorites when I was a filly!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We'll take it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Mm, should I go with something more current..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "?"
Flurry Heart says: "Ta-da!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Cheerilee, I am so, so sorry!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I didn't even hear her leave!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "There, all clean."
Cheerilee says: "Great."
Cheerilee says: "Now I'll just write it up again..."
Cheerilee says: "!"
Cheerilee says: "With my mouth."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ehh..."
Spearhead says: "Feast your eyes."
Spearhead says: "This one's called "A Kitchen Guard's Journey"!"
Princess Cadance says: "Oh..."
Shining Armor says: "This reminds me of the time Flurry got into the chocolate pudding, and we found little chocolate hoofprints all over the carpet."
Princess Cadance says: "That took forever to clean up!"
Princess Cadance says: "But remember how cute her little face looked when we caught her?"
Shining Armor says: "Yeah."
Shining Armor says: "She was like,  "Uh-oh!"
Spearhead says: "Whoa, art is so evocative!"
Spearhead says: "I wasn't even going for that memory!"
Spearhead says: "Score!"
Spike says: "Honestly, Twilight, I don't even want to tell you how late we are."
Spike says: "Should I just cancel our visit to the hospital?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Cancel?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We can't cancel, Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The sick foals are counting on us!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And the B."
Twilight Sparkle says: "A."
Twilight Sparkle says: "E."
Twilight Sparkle says: "would never throw in the towel like that!"
Spike says: "B."
Spike says: "A."
Spike says: "E."
Spike says: "?"
Twilight Sparkle says: ""Best Aunt Ever"?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Besides, this errand is gonna be different."
Spike says: "How do you figure that?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Because Flurry can play with the Cake twins and stay out of trouble!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Best aunt ever!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wonderful!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "They're friends already!"
Spike says: "Huh."
Spike says: "I shouldn't have doubted you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thanks!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wait, you doubted me?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, you watch Flurry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll take care of everything else."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hi, Pinkie!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "How's it going?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I need to pick up the cupcakes for the foals at the hospital!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And can you do apology treats?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm good."
Pinkie Pie says: "Here they are."
Pinkie Pie says: "Of course I can!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Do you still have a giant file on everypony's favorite treat?"
Pinkie Pie says: "In my secret party planning cave!"
Pinkie Pie says: "BRB!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hee-hee!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Remind me to tell you later how amazing you are."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Cheerilee?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Eh."
Pinkie Pie says: "I am pretty awesome."
Pinkie Pie says: "Cherry oatmeal cookies with yellow sprinkles."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Great!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Can you write "sorry" on them?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I've got a stamp for that!"
Spike says: "Hey, you guys!"
Spike says: "No need to fight!"
Spike says: "Uh..."
Spike says: "Hang on!"
Spike says: "I'm sure there's another one!"
Spike says: "Ugh, no, not this one..."
Spike says: "Oh, that's cute..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hold on, sweetie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We'll play in a second."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The salespony at the toy store..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Apple strudel cupcake with caramel drizzle!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, no."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're making the same face Cheerilee made."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie, remind me what your favorite treat is."
Pinkie Pie says: "Mmm..."
Pinkie Pie says: "The sampler platter."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We'll take three of those."
Spike says: "Aha!"
Spike says: "Told you I'd find another one."
Spike says: "Uh..."
Spike says: "Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Out of the question!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We are not cancelling!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's going to be okay!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It has to be okay!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's been so terrible so far it can't possibly end up—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh..."
Spike says: "Uh, sorry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, I needed it."
Spike says: "I was just gonna say, we're here."
Spike says: "And we're only four-and-a-half minutes late!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Four and a half?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: ""..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "and while nopony had ever tried to reach Cloudsdale on hoof, Gusty the Great was not deterred!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "She and her unicorn warriors marched up the hill."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But suddenly, they encountered..."
Spike says: "What?!"
Spike says: "!"
Spike says: "What was it?!"
Spike says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: ""It was the treacherous Grogar..."
Twilight Sparkle says: ""..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "and Gusty could tell he was ready for battle."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Gusty called out to the unicorn warriors—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "" Ow!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not right now, Flurry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "These foals really want to hear this."
Whammy squeaking.
Twilight Sparkle says: ""'We can fight Grogar together!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "' And the unicorn warriors shot magical beams into the clouds that wove into one!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The beam, stronger than a thousand armies, shined down!"
Twilight Sparkle says: ""It wrapped around Grogar and pulled him to the ground!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "'Don't let him escape!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "', yelled Gusty!"
Nurse Redheart says: "Say 'ah'."
Cherry Fizzy says: "Ahhh—"
Cherry Fizzy says: "—"
Cherry Fizzy says: "aaargh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: ""Grogar was strong, for fear gave him power, and he broke through the bonds!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "So good, right?"
Spike says: "Twilight, look up!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, you're floating."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're floating!"
Spike says: "So are you!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Flurry, honey, you need to stop this."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Put us down, please."
Spike says: "Twilight, look out!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nopony panic!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Everything's gonna be okay!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, I can't keep up with her!"
Spike says: "Oh, yeah, where's her Snoozle?!"
Spike says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Her what?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Spike says: "You know, her Whacky Whompy thing?"
Spike says: "The snail?"
Spike says: "Where is it?"
Spike says: "Cadance said it calms her down."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't see it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Flurry Heart!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Put us all down this instant!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Is everypony okay?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Flurry, that was very, very bad!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You could have hurt somepony!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Flurry, I didn't mean to—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sweetie, you don't have to be scared."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's just me, see?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're scared of me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Because I yelled at you like a big scary bear."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Flurry, I'm so sorry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've been a terrible aunt today."
Twilight Sparkle says: "All you wanted to do was play, and I've barely been able to pay attention to you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "None of this is your fault."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's mine."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So much for being the best aunt ever."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But I hope you know how much I love you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, I take it you forgive me?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thanks, Flurry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "How about we head home?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "After we find your Whammy, of course."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And clean up."
Princess Cadance says: "This one kind of reminds me of Flurry's hair."
Shining Armor says: "Uh-huh."
Shining Armor says: "And this one reminds me of Flurry too."
Spearhead says: "How so?"
Shining Armor says: "It's small..."
Shining Armor says: "like her!"
Shining Armor says: "I-I can't do this anymore!"
Shining Armor says: "Spearhead, this has been great, but—"
Spearhead says: "Say no more."
Spearhead says: "My art has always spoken to me about what I love."
Spearhead says: "But knowing that it spoke to you about what you love speaks to me."
Shining Armor says: "What..."
Shining Armor says: "?"
Spearhead says: "Go to her."
Shining Armor says: "Flurry?!"
Shining Armor says: "!"
Shining Armor says: "Where's our little foal?!"
Shining Armor says: "!"
Shining Armor says: "Ah!"
Shining Armor says: "Oh, we missed you so much!"
Princess Cadance says: "But it looks like you had a great time without us."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Actually, not so much."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Flurry got into some mischief, but it wasn't her fault."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I shouldn't have agreed to watch her with such a jam-packed schedule."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It was too much to juggle."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But Flurry taught me an important lesson today."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It turns out being the best aunt ever isn't about spending the most time with your niece, but spending quality time with her."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And she taught me a really cool bear game, so I guess I learned two things."
Shining Armor says: "Well, we definitely should've given you more of a heads up."
Princess Cadance says: "Yes!"
Princess Cadance says: "From now on, we'll give you plenty of notice."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ohh, that would be great."
Princess Cadance says: "Hey, what are you doing next Tuesday?"
Princess Cadance says: "For dinner, not to babysit."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll have to check with Spike, but I think we're free."
Princess Cadance says: "Where is Spike, anyway?"
Spike says: ""The dashing dragon warrior breathed a scorching flame from his snout, then chuckled to himself as he flew into the sunset."
Spike says: "'If you can't stand the heat, don't fight a dragon!"
"Peach Fuzz" says: "Hey, you kinda look like him!"
Spike says: "Thank you!"
Spike says: "Okay, now who wants more cake?"
