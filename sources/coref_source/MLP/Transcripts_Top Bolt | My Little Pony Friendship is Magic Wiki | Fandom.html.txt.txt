Rainbow Dash says: "Spring training was awesome, but I can't wait to see my friends!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm gonna catch up on some Daring Do with Twilight, help Applejack make my favorite cider, and have a sleepover with Pinkie!"
Misty Fly says: "We get it."
Misty Fly says: "You have a fun week planned."
Spitfire says: "Meanwhile, I'm stuck here running trials week at the Academy."
Rainbow Dash says: "But you love yelling and blowing your whistle."
Spitfire says: "Yeah."
Spitfire says: "I do."
Rainbow Dash says: "See you gals later!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, the map!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, Twilight!"
Rainbow Dash says: "So where am I going?"
Rainbow Dash says: "The Crystal Mountains?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Vanhoover?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Here?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Please say here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, the good news is we both got called by the map!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Awesome!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Does that mean there's bad news?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, not exactly."
Rainbow Dash says: "I was just there!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ooh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ahem."
Spitfire says: "All right, newbies!"
Spitfire says: "Welcome to trials week for the Wonderbolt Academy!"
Spitfire says: "You'll be judged on your speed, strength, agility, and technique, culminating in a final evaluation."
Spitfire says: "Will it be hard?"
Spitfire says: "Yes!"
Spitfire says: "Will you cry?"
Spitfire says: "Maybe."
Spitfire says: "Will you fly so much your wings fall off?"
Spitfire says: "That has only happened once."
Angel Wings says: "She's just exaggerating to make a point, right?"
Angel Wings says: "I mean, wings can't really fall off..."
Angel Wings says: "can they?"
Spitfire says: "You think you've got what it takes to be an elite flyer?"
Sky Stinger says: "Yes, ma'am."
Rest of recruits says: "Yes, ma'am!"
Spitfire says: "Well, lemme tell you."
Spitfire says: "You don't!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I remember when she said that to me."
Angel Wings says: "You don't think Rainbow Dash is the pony whose wings fell off, do you?"
Spitfire says: "Quit your whispering and give me five hundred laps!"
Spitfire says: "Go, go, go!"
Angel Wings says: "Um, I just wanted you to know, you two are my favorite ponies in all of Equestria."
Spitfire says: "Well, isn't that sweet?"
Spitfire says: "Now get going on those laps!"
Spitfire says: "Welcome, Princess Twilight."
Spitfire says: "What are you doing back so soon?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Official friendship business."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Have you noticed anypony having a hard time with their friends?"
Spitfire says: "Not really, but it's not my job to worry about their relationships."
Spitfire says: "I'm here to make them elite flyers."
Rainbow Dash says: "Adorable."
Rainbow Dash says: "They're so full of hope and competition."
Rainbow Dash says: "Eh, their technique could use some work, though."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You should tell them."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm sure they'd appreciate any notes from you."
Rainbow Dash says: "Nah."
Rainbow Dash says: "I wouldn't want to mess with their confidence."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But they'll never get better if they don't know what to work on."
Spitfire says: "Sloppy wing placement, crooked lines..."
Spitfire says: "I'm gonna have to drill them on basic technique in the classroom portion."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Classroom portion?"
Spitfire says: "Yeah, it's everypony's least favorite part of trial week, but it has to be done."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Maybe we can help!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We can?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Absolutely!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Between your flying skills and my teaching expertise, they could learn a lot!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Plus, once they get to know us, they'll be more comfortable coming to us with their friendship problems!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Count us in!"
Spitfire says: "Great!"
Spitfire says: "You have your work cut out for you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thank goodness I had time to whip up a few charts on flight patterns and wing symmetry!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's fresh in my mind from when I learned to fly!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is so exciting!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Maybe for you."
Rainbow Dash says: "I practically fell asleep when I went through this."
Rainbow Dash says: "Tell you what."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'll leave the teaching stuff to you, and I'll just make sure they stay awake!"
Twilight's ears ringing.
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm pretty sure their thirst for knowledge will keep them bright-eyed and bushy-tailed."
Rainbow Dash says: "Good one, Twilight."
Rainbow Dash says: "Wake up, newbies!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Class is in session!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hello, students!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm Twilight Sparkle, and this is Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash says: "But you can call us "T-Sparks" and "The Dashinator"!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Just kidding."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And we're here to go over basic flying technique."
Rainbow Dash says: "Who said that?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Sky Stinger says: "Me."
Sky Stinger says: "I mean, we're here because we're amazingly awesome crazy-good flyers."
Sky Stinger says: "We're way past basics."
Rainbow Dash says: "What's your name?"
Sky Stinger says: "Sky Stinger."
Sky Stinger says: "You've, uh, never heard of me?"
Vapor Trail says: "He set the record for the fastest vertical acceleration rate!"
Vapor Trail says: "Five hundred feet in two seconds!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh."
Rainbow Dash says: "That's pretty impressive."
Vapor Trail says: "It's amazing."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It is, and we can talk personal records after class, Ms..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "?"
Sky Stinger says: "Vapor Trail."
Sky Stinger says: "She's my wingpony."
Sky Stinger says: "I never fly without her."
Rainbow Dash says: "But you'll have to in the solo trials."
Vapor Trail says: "There are..."
Vapor Trail says: "..."
Vapor Trail says: "solo trials?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yup."
Rainbow Dash says: "It's a part of your final evaluation."
Sky Stinger says: "We'll ace that test with our wings tied behind our flanks."
Sky Stinger says: "My picture will go right up there, next to yours."
Rainbow Dash says: "That's a mighty big claim, considering everypony here is an amazingly awesome crazy-good flyer."
Sky Stinger says: "I know."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's get back on track."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now, who can tell me the best wing angle to achieve minimal air resistance?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wake up newbies!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Class is in session!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, there were a few hiccups, but overall, that went pretty well."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, nopony fell asleep."
Rainbow Dash says: "What?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm not a student!"
Sky Stinger says: "Hey, Teach!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Me or Twilight?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Probably Twilight."
Sky Stinger says: "Um, uh, both."
Sky Stinger says: "About the solo test."
Sky Stinger says: "I'm actually kinda worried about it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Aw, that's all right."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We all have moments where we doubt ourselves."
Sky Stinger says: "No, no."
Sky Stinger says: "I've absolutely zero doubts about myself."
Sky Stinger says: "I'm a strong flyer."
Sky Stinger says: "Like, really, really, really strong."
Sky Stinger says: "This isn't about me."
Sky Stinger says: "I'm worried for Vapor."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, well, that is very..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "kind of you?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Tell you what."
Rainbow Dash says: "It's almost time for your freestyle training."
Rainbow Dash says: "Why don't you grab her and show us what you got?"
Sky Stinger says: "Yes!"
Sky Stinger says: "Prepare to be impressed!"
Sky Stinger says: "By me."
Sky Stinger says: "Like I said, Vapor still needs work."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, he may be full of himself, but I have to admit, Sky is an excellent flyer."
Twilight Sparkle says: "He must have shot up two hundred feet!"
Rainbow Dash says: "But did you see Vapor Trail?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Her wing was under his."
Rainbow Dash says: "I think she gave him a boost."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I guess I didn't even notice Vapor."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I was too busy watching Sky."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Somepony paid attention in class!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Sky obviously has no idea he's not actually amazingly awesome."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And Vapor's so busy making her friend look good, she's not focused on her own flying at all."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This must be our friendship problem!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And there's only one thing to do!"
Fix it without telling them.
Tell them the truth.
Twilight Sparkle says: "You don't want to tell them?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Of course not!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Flying is like thirty percent skill and seventy percent confidence!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You can't mess with a flyer's confidence!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But you can't improve if you don't think you have to!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Besides, Vapor's keeping a pretty big secret from Sky, and that could lead to trouble!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, but if we tell them that they've been holding each other back, that could be trouble too!"
Sky Stinger says: "Ah, I nailed that flipping loop."
Sky Stinger says: "I'm actually surprised you're still here."
Sky Stinger says: "Thought I blew you away."
Vapor Trail says: "You were..."
Vapor Trail says: "great, Sky."
Spitfire says: "Come on, Vapor Trail!"
Spitfire says: "You're gonna have to build up your endurance if you want a shot at the Academy!"
Spitfire says: "Wonderbolts don't get winded!"
Spitfire says: "Angel Wings, you call that cloud-busting?!"
Spitfire says: "!"
Spitfire says: "That cloud barely knew you were there!"
Spitfire says: "I love my job."
Sky Stinger says: "We'll keep working, and who knows?"
Sky Stinger says: "One day, you might come close to being almost as good as me."
Vapor Trail says: "Oh, I don't think so."
Vapor Trail says: "You were voted Stratusburg's most promising flyer!"
Vapor Trail says: "I was voted best sneeze."
Sky Stinger says: "You do have a really great sneeze."
Vapor Trail says: "Thanks, Sky, but I don't think I can sneeze my way into the Academy."
Vapor Trail says: "I'm pretty beat."
Vapor Trail says: "I'm gonna hit the showers."
Sky Stinger says: "You have to help her."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Actually, she's not the one—"
Rainbow Dash says: "Will do!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, you did great."
Rainbow Dash says: "You're a really strong flyer."
Vapor Trail says: "Uh, me?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Vapor Trail, we know what you've been doing."
Rainbow Dash says: "You've been doing great!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You've been helping Sky!"
Vapor Trail says: "Uh, I don't know what you're talking about!"
Vapor Trail says: "Sky doesn't need anypony's help."
Vapor Trail says: "He's amazing."
Rainbow Dash says: "Not without you."
Rainbow Dash says: "And it's gonna be pretty obvious during the solo trials when he can't get enough air to do a flipping loop."
Vapor Trail says: "Oh, no!"
Vapor Trail says: "I can't let that happen!"
Vapor Trail says: "I mean, ah, uh..."
Vapor Trail says: "Aw, sugarcubes!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why are you doing this for him?"
Vapor Trail says: "It started when we were kids."
Vapor Trail says: "You have to understand..."
Vapor Trail says: "..."
Vapor Trail says: "Sky grew up with a lot of siblings."
Vapor Trail says: "It was tough."
Vapor Trail says: "He was always trying to get his parents' attention."
Vapor Trail says: "Meanwhile, I was an only child who hated all the attention I got from mine."
"Twirly Whirly" says: "Vapor Trail!"
"Twirly Whirly" says: "Where are you?"
"Twirly Whirly" says: "Do you need a snack?"
"Twirly Whirly" says: "Do you wanna do homework?"
"Steer Straight" says: "Or we can just spend some time together!"
"Steer Straight" says: "All day is never enough!"
Young Sky Stinger says: "Mom, Dad, I'm here!"
Young Sky Stinger says: "Look, look, look-look-look-look, hey!"
Young Sky Stinger says: "Mom, Dad, can you see?"
Young Vapor Trail says: "Whoa, that was amazing!"
Vapor Trail says: "Flying together gave us both what we wanted!"
Vapor Trail says: "But I never told Sky how much I was helping him."
Vapor Trail says: "It started with a small boost here or a little gust of wind there, but I didn't think my help could actually hurt his chances."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I understand."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But now you're both in trouble!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You need to work on your tricks, and Sky needs to be able to fly without you or he won't make it."
Vapor Trail says: "Oh, but he has to!"
Vapor Trail says: "Flying with the Wonderbolts has been Sky's dream ever since he was a colt!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What about you?"
Vapor Trail says: "I..."
Vapor Trail says: "I guess I haven't thought about it."
Vapor Trail says: "I just want to be with my best friend."
Rainbow Dash says: "Then we have to find a way to help both of you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Starting with telling Sky the truth."
Vapor Trail says: "No, you can't!"
Vapor Trail says: "Sky will be crushed!"
Vapor Trail says: "And without his confidence, he won't fly as well!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Then I guess we'll give Dash's method a shot."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yes!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hah-hah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I love being right!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay, here's what we do."
Rainbow Dash says: "Sky needs to build his strength."
Rainbow Dash says: "Air drills, wing lifts, all that boring methodical stuff."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sounds like my cup of oats."
Vapor Trail says: "But how will we get him to do that?"
Vapor Trail says: "He doesn't think he needs practice."
Rainbow Dash says: "We'll just tell Sky that he should practice with Twilight so you won't feel so self-conscious about getting special training from me."
Vapor Trail says: "With you?"
Vapor Trail says: "Really?!"
Vapor Trail says: "!"
Vapor Trail says: "You'd do that for me?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hah."
Rainbow Dash says: "You say that like it's not gonna be a blast."
Vapor Trail says: "Whooa..."
Vapor Trail says: "Ah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, you were awesome!"
Vapor Trail says: "Really?"
Vapor Trail says: "Thanks!"
Vapor Trail says: "I can't believe I was able to keep up!"
Rainbow Dash says: "That's the first nice thing I've heard you say about yourself."
Sky Stinger says: "Hey, can we switch now?"
Sky Stinger says: "I want to do tricks with Rainbow Dash!"
Vapor Trail says: "You can't!"
Vapor Trail says: "I mean, uh, you're already so good at the fancy stuff!"
Sky Stinger says: "Heh."
Sky Stinger says: "And the basic stuff."
Sky Stinger says: "You're right, I don't need to practice at all."
Vapor Trail says: "Um, maybe, Sky, you should..."
Sky Stinger says: "I'm already the best and everypony's gonna know it when I'm asked to join the Academy tomorrow."
Vapor Trail says: "But not if you don't practice..."
Vapor Trail says: "!"
Sky Stinger says: "Heh."
Sky Stinger says: "I wouldn't be surprised if they asked me to become a Wonderbolt straight out of the trials."
Sky Stinger says: "Boom, dream achieved."
Sky Stinger says: "What did you say?"
Vapor Trail says: "Sky, I want you to get in as much as anypony, and you're amazing, but..."
Sky Stinger says: "But what?"
Vapor Trail says: "I've been..."
Vapor Trail says: "helping you."
Rainbow Dash says: "Gyuh..."
Sky Stinger says: "How can you do this to me?"
Sky Stinger says: "Did you all know?"
Sky Stinger says: "Oh, great."
Sky Stinger says: "So everypony but me knows I'm a joke."
Sky Stinger says: "Was this your plan the whole time?"
Sky Stinger says: "To embarrass me?"
Vapor Trail says: "What?"
Vapor Trail says: "No!"
Vapor Trail says: "Don't you know me at all?"
Sky Stinger says: "I guess not, since it took me this long to find out you're a terrible wingpony!"
Vapor Trail says: "I can't believe you!"
Sky Stinger says: "I can't believe I was ever your friend!"
Vapor Trail says: "Thanks a lot."
Dizzitron whirring.
Rainbow Dash says: "Do you think they're still mad?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, they're still mad."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is all my fault."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If we'd just done things your way, maybe we could have avoided this whole mess."
Rainbow Dash says: "No, it's my fault."
Rainbow Dash says: "It hit me when I was watching Sky train with you."
Rainbow Dash says: "He wasn't even trying!"
Dizzitron whirring.
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, no."
Rainbow Dash says: "He's lost his confidence."
Spitfire says: "Do you want to tell me why one of my most promising students is flying like a balloon with a hole in it?!"
Spitfire says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, it's a long story, but we'll fix it."
Spitfire says: "Yes, you will."
Rainbow Dash says: "We really messed up, huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I have a plan."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey, Sky."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I thought I might find you here."
Sky Stinger says: "Well, apparently, I need a lot of practice."
Sky Stinger says: "Guess I'm not the natural I thought I was."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No, you're not."
Sky Stinger says: "Thanks."
Sky Stinger says: "Good pep talk."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I wasn't a natural at friendship."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But with some practice and help from my friends, I got better, and now I'm the Princess of Friendship!"
Sky Stinger says: "So you're saying I can be the..."
Sky Stinger says: "Princess of Flying?"
Rainbow Dash says: "You know, you're really good."
Rainbow Dash says: "You're lead pony material."
Vapor Trail says: "Hm."
Vapor Trail says: "That's sweet of you, but no."
Vapor Trail says: "I couldn't handle all the attention."
Rainbow Dash says: "But you'll never become a Wonderbolt if you're too afraid to shine."
Rainbow Dash says: "That is what you want, right?"
Vapor Trail says: "Well, not at first."
Vapor Trail says: "I just wanted to be with Sky."
Vapor Trail says: "But learning to do all those fun tricks with you?"
Vapor Trail says: "It made me realize this is something I want for myself!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I was hoping you'd say that."
Rainbow Dash says: "Come with me."
Sky Stinger says: "What's she doing here?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Sky, Vapor was never trying to steal your spotlight."
Rainbow Dash says: "She thought she was helping you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And Vapor, you shouldn't have been so content to take a back seat."
Rainbow Dash says: "Now, you can either stay mad, or help each other and become two of the greatest flyers the Wonderbolt Academy has ever seen!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Please pick the second option."
Rainbow Dash says: "I don't want Spitfire to be mad at me."
Vapor Trail says: "You got this, Sky!"
Sky Stinger says: "Focus on a cloud when you spin!"
Sky Stinger says: "It'll help you fly straight when you come out of it!"
Vapor Trail says: "Uh-huh!"
Sky Stinger says: "Whoo, yeah!"
Spitfire says: "Congratulations!"
Spitfire says: "You've both made it into the Wonderbolt Academy!"
Spitfire says: "Whatever you did, it worked."
Spitfire says: "They still have a lot of potential."
Spitfire says: "Who knows?"
Spitfire says: "They might even be better than you, Crash."
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay, let's not get carried away."
Angel Wings says: "Um, I just wanted you to know, you two are my new favorite ponies in all of Equestria."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, I heard that!"
Vapor Trail says: "I can't believe we did it!"
Sky Stinger says: "You were great!"
Sky Stinger says: "Even though you can out-fly me, you can be my wingpony anytime."
Vapor Trail says: "Aw."
Vapor Trail says: "And you can be mine."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Phew."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's good to be home."
Rainbow Dash says: "You're telling me."
Rainbow Dash says: "Now we can finally catch up with some Daring Do, I can make cider with Applejack—"
Misty Fly says: "Dash!"
Misty Fly says: "I've been looking all over for you!"
Misty Fly says: "Wonderbolt emergency!"
Misty Fly says: "We got to get back to HQ."
Rainbow Dash says: "You've gotta be kidding me!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I was just there!"
