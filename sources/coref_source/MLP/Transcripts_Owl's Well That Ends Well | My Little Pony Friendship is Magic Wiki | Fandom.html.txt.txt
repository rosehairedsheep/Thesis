Twilight Sparkle says: "This meteor shower tonight's gonna be amazing!"
Spike says: "Awesome!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You know, this shower only happens once every 100 years."
Spike says: "A centennial celebration!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We better get a move on!"
Spike says: "Don't wanna be late!"
Spike says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Spike says: "There."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, did you grab my quill and ink?"
Spike says: "Check!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Scrolls?"
Spike says: "Check!"
Spike says: "I've also packed a telescope, apples, bananas, fruit punch, and my freshly baked homemade triple-decker nut-crazy vanilla cream cookies!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can see that."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Once again you've read my mind, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And that is why you are my number one assistant."
Spike says: "I'm sorry."
Spike says: "I didn't hear you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That is why you are my number one assistant."
Spike says: "Missed that!"
Spike says: "Huh..."
Spike says: "?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I said..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Come on, let's get going."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wait!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I almost forgot!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I wanna bring the "Astronomical Astronomer's Almanac to All Things Astronomy"."
Spike says: "The Astronomo-lomo homono what?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You know that really old big blue book on stars, moons, planets, the universe..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "?"
Spike says: "Right."
Spike says: "Check!"
Spike says: "Ah..."
Spike says: "Ahh..."
Spike says: "Ahhh..."
Spike says: "Ahhhh..."
Spike says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's taking my number one assistant so long?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I was sure I put the astronomer's guide back."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The book would have helped me identify different planets and stars tonight."
Spike says: "Well..."
Spike says: "maybe someone borrowed it."
Spike says: "Besides, you don't need that book."
Spike says: "You can already name all the planets and stars, 'cause you're super smart and astronomically awesome!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thanks, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're such a flatterer."
Spike says: "Yeah, I'm a sweet talker."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And a number one assistant, right?"
Spike says: "Check!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wow, Twilight!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You're lucky to have such a rad assistant."
Rainbow Dash says: "I wish I had someone to do whatever I told them."
Scootaloo says: "Ooh!"
Scootaloo says: "Ooh!"
Scootaloo says: "Me!"
Scootaloo says: "Me!"
Scootaloo says: "Me!"
Scootaloo says: "I'll do whatever you want, Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh yeah, pipsqueak?"
Rainbow Dash says: "How about taking out the trash?"
Scootaloo says: "Yes ma'am!"
Rarity says: "Do we have Spike to thank again for this amazing spread?"
Rarity says: "Isn't he simply amazing?"
Spike says: "Oh, come on."
Spike says: "I said come on."
Pinkie Pie says: "Little Spikey-wikey!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Who knew that big ferocious dragon started off so cutesy wootsy?"
Rarity says: "Spike, you are such a little star that I had to make a little bow tie for you."
Spike says: "Gosh."
Spike says: "You guys are embarrassing me."
Spike says: "Stop it."
Spike says: "Twilight, your turn."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, that's enough."
Spike says: "Oh, right."
Spike says: "That's enough."
Sweetie Belle says: "Hey, everypony!"
Sweetie Belle says: "The show is starting!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Woah..."
Spike says: "Woah..."
Spike says: "Huh?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Mmm."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wow!"
Pinkie Pie says: "These cookies are delish!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike made them."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Speaking of, Spike, can you bring us some punch?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike?"
Rarity says: "Oh, poor little thing."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Aww..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "He's worked himself to the bone."
Pinkie Pie says: "And now the punch has been..."
Pinkie Pie says: ""spiked"!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Goodnight, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: ""The Study of Comets."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Comets are small, irregularly shaped bodies that are made of nonvolatile grains and frozen gases."
Twilight Sparkle says: "They..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Huh."
Twilight Sparkle says: ""..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "have body structures that are fragile and diverse..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Shoot!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is a job for Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If only he were awake..."
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wait!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Don't go!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Don't be afraid."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thank you for returning my scroll."
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo!"
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo!"
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo-hoo."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Gosh, it's cold tonight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Say, would you like to relax in here and keep me company while I work?"
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo!"
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now, where was I?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, yes."
Twilight Sparkle says: ""..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "fragile and diverse with a surrounding cloud of material called a coma, that grows in size and brightness as the comet approaches the sun..."
Spike says: "Huh?"
Spike says: "Waah!"
Spike says: "I overslept!"
Spike says: "I know it's already ten, but I'm scaly-tailed and bright-eyed and ready to work twice as fast!"
Spike says: "Oh please, don't be upset, Twilight!"
Spike says: "And what do you want for breakfast?"
Spike says: "Oatmeal?"
Spike says: "How about a sunflower smoothie?"
Spike says: "Grass pancakes?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, don't worry."
Spike says: "But my morning chores..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's okay."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Owlowiscious did them for you."
Spike says: "Who?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "He's our new junior assistant."
Twilight Sparkle says: "He's gonna help out with your chores so you won't be so tired all the time."
Spike says: "Wha..."
Spike says: "Wh..."
Spike says: "What do we need a junior assistant for?"
Spike says: "I'm not tired."
Spike says: "I do fine on my own."
Spike says: "I don't need sleep, I..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, don't worry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "He's just here to help out a little."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now, I have to go out, so why don't you introduce yourself to Owlowiscious?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "He's in the library."
Spike says: "Worried?"
Spike says: "Do I look worried?"
Spike says: "I'm not worried."
Spike says: "Who's worried?"
Spike says: "Hello?"
Spike says: "Hellooo!"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "Dude, that's creepy."
Spike says: "Uh..."
Spike says: "Hi there!"
Spike says: "I'm Spike."
Spike says: "I'm sure Twilight has told you all about me."
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo."
Spike says: "Uh, Spike?"
Spike says: "You know, assistant number one?"
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo?"
Spike says: "I'm Spike!"
Spike says: "And who are you?"
Spike says: "What are you?"
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo!"
Spike says: "Who?"
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo!"
Spike says: "I thought your name was Owlowiscious!"
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo?"
Spike says: "Okay, "Who", "Owlowiscious", whatever."
Spike says: "I'm Spike, okay?"
Spike says: "Look!"
Spike says: "All you need to know is that I'm number one and you're number two."
Spike says: "Got it?"
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo?"
Spike says: "So, a man of mystery, huh?"
Spike says: "I'm keeping my eye on you!"
Spike says: "I've got eyes in the back of my head too, you know."
Spike says: "Well, not really, but..."
Spike says: "you know what I mean!"
Spike says: "That bird is out for my job."
Spike says: "He wants to be number one."
Spike says: "I'll prove to Twilight that I deserve to be number one."
Spike says: "Not Freaky Feathers over there."
Spike says: "I won't let him have my job if it's the last thing I do!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, what a fantastical, flufflicious feathery little friend!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm..."
Pinkie Pie says: "hooked!"
Fluttershy says: "He's just wonderful."
Spike says: "Uh, yes."
Spike says: "Wonderful."
Spike says: "He's quite..."
Spike says: "the charmer."
Rarity says: "And Owlowiscious is just such a star I just had to make this little bow for you."
Spike says: "Grrr!"
Applejack says: "What's he all saddle sore about?"
Rainbow Dash says: "He's probably just jealous of Owlowiscious."
Fluttershy says: "Maybe Spike feels threatened or worried that Owlowiscious will replace him?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Replace him?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hah!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's crazy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike knows he can't be replaced."
Spike says: "They're trying to replace me!"
Spike says: "I better step it up and make sure that Twilight and Owlowiscious know that I'm still number one!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey, Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Can you fetch me that book called "Two-headed Myth—"
Spike says: "..."
Spike says: "Mythological Mysteries!"
Spike says: "" I know where it is."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thanks, Owlowiscious."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey, Spike, no worries."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Owlowiscious flew up and got the book for me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, and gee!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I guess I need "Ferrets of Fairyland" too."
Spike says: "Hey!"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Climb down from there before you fall."
Spike says: "Grrr!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Shoot!"
Spike says: "Yes, sir!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "My last writing quill."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's broken."
Spike says: "Never fear!"
Spike says: "Spike, your number one assistant, is here!"
Spike says: "Quill..."
Spike says: "Quill..."
Spike says: "Where is it?"
Spike says: "Not here..."
Spike says: "Quill..."
Spike says: "Quill, where is it..."
Spike says: "?"
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo."
Spike says: "Where am I gonna get a quill?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, wait!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wait!"
Spike says: "But the store is called "Quills and Sofas"."
Spike says: "You only sell two things!"
Davenport says: "Sorry, Junior."
Davenport says: "All outta quills until Monday."
Davenport says: "Need a sofa?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I swore I had one here somewhere."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ah, here it is!"
Pinkie Pie says: "A quince!"
Spike says: "Not a quince."
Spike says: "A quill!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Right."
Pinkie Pie says: "A quail?"
Pinkie Pie says: "A quilt!"
Pinkie Pie says: "A quesadilla?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Aha!"
Pinkie Pie says: "A quiche!"
Spike says: "Not a quiche."
Spike says: "A quill!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Nope."
Pinkie Pie says: "Sorry."
Pinkie Pie says: "All outta quills."
Spike says: "Shoot."
Spike says: "Come on, chicken!"
Spike says: "Here, chicky-chicky-chicky!"
Spike says: "Here, chick-chick-chick-chicky!"
Spike says: "Come here!"
Spike says: "Ugh!"
Spike says: "Come here!"
Spike says: "Not the face, not the face!"
Spike says: "No!"
Spike says: "Hey!"
Spike says: "Stop!"
Spike says: "Quit it!"
Spike says: "Spike..."
Spike says: "to the rescue."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I was calling out for you when you were turning this place upside down."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Owlowiscious gave me one of his feathers to use as a quill."
Spike says: "That's just great."
Spike says: "Perfect!"
Spike says: "Sweet!"
Spike says: "I think I'll just, uh..."
Spike says: "finish up the rest of my chores!"
Spike says: "Or did Owlowiscious already do them?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, no no."
Twilight Sparkle says: "There are quite a lot of them."
Spike says: "Well, that's fine."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Poor Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "He'll come around."
Twilight Sparkle says: "He's genuinely a good little guy."
Spike says: "Huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What is this?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You said this book was missing."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, Owlowiscious found it right where it belongs, but like this."
Twilight Sparkle says: "How did it get this way?"
Spike says: "Uh..."
Spike says: "Well, um..."
Spike says: "You see, I..."
Spike says: "I just didn't wanna disappoint you and, uh..."
Spike says: "Have you ever seen a dragon sneeze?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've seen a dragon lie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm very disappointed in you, Spike."
Spike says: "You set me up!"
Spike says: "Well, two can play that game."
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo!"
Spike says: "Not "who"!"
Spike says: "Two!"
Spike says: "Urgh!"
Spike says: "Owlowiscious is out to take my place, I just know it!"
Spike says: "I've gotta stop him."
Spike says: "But how?"
Spike says: "Ah..."
Spike says: "Muahahaha!"
Rarity says: "Come along, Opal."
Rarity says: "Let's hurry up and get to Fluttershy's tea party."
Spike says: "So lifelike."
Spike says: "And when Twilight discovers it shredded up on her floor, she'll think mouse-eating Owlowiscious is to blame."
Spike says: "And I'll be number one..."
Spike says: "again!"
Spike says: "Muhahaha!"
Spike says: "That poor little field mouse!"
Spike says: "Torn to pieces!"
Spike says: "It must have been Owlowiscious!"
Spike says: "You know, since owls eat, you know, mice."
Spike says: "What a terrible, terrible bird!"
Spike says: "He must be punished!"
Spike says: "Right?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't know what upsets me more—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "that you deliberately tried to set up Owlowiscious, or that you actually thought this pathetic attempt would work!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You've let your jealousy get the best of you, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I am truly disappointed."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is not the Spike I know and love."
Spike says: "She..."
Spike says: "She doesn't love me anymore."
Spike says: "Twilight hates me."
Spike says: "I'm cold, hungry, tired and lonely."
Spike says: "Could it get any worse?"
Spike says: "I guess that's a yes."
Spike says: "Hello?"
Spike says: "Hello?"
Spike says: "What is that?"
Spike says: "If this is what running away is all about, I never wanna go home!"
Spike says: "Gems!"
Spike says: "Mmm..."
Spike says: "Woohoo!"
Spike says: "Even if my tummy's full, the rest of me is still empty."
Spike says: "I miss Twilight and the pony gang."
Spike says: "But she doesn't love me anymore."
Spike says: "So, I'm better off here, all by myself."
Spike says: "Wow."
Spike says: "Seems to be getting warmer."
Spike says: "The steam is great for my complexion, but it's sure getting hot in here."
Green dragon says: "What are you doing in my cave?"
Green dragon says: "And why are you eating my gems?"
Spike says: "Uh, heyah bro!"
Spike says: "I didn't know this was your cave."
Spike says: "And I didn't know these were your gems, but..."
Spike says: "we're cool, right?"
Spike says: "Whoa, whoa!"
Spike says: "Hey..."
Spike says: "We're like brothers, you know?"
Spike says: "I mean, you're a dragon, I'm a dragon..."
Spike says: "It's us against the world, right?"
Spike says: "You don't scare me!"
Spike says: "So you're big."
Spike says: "Really big."
Spike says: "And your claws are super sharp."
Spike says: "Tail..."
Spike says: "extra spiky."
Spike says: "But, uh..."
Spike says: "You don't scare me!"
Spike says: "Ha!"
Spike says: "How'd you like that?"
Spike says: "Uh..."
Spike says: "I'd love to stay, but gotta go!"
Spike says: "See ya!"
Spike says: "Wouldn't wanna be ya!"
Spike says: "Aah!"
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo-hoo!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Over here!"
Spike says: "Am I glad to see you!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hurry!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hop on!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's too dark!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can't see!"
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo!"
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo-hoo!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We were so worried about you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I was so worried about you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why did you run away?"
Spike says: "I thought you didn't need me anymore."
Spike says: "And that you didn't love me anymore."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sure, I was disappointed, but you are my number one assistant!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And friend."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And you always will be."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's just that sometimes I need some help at night."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can't ask you to stay up late."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're a baby dragon and you need your rest."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Owls are nocturnal."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So I asked Owlowiscious to help."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But not to take your place."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No one could ever replace you, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not even when you are being a jealous numbskull."
Spike says: "I'm sorry, Twilight."
Spike says: "I never should have been so jealous."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And I'm sorry too, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I should have been more sensitive."
Spike says: "And Owlowiscious..."
Spike says: "I know now that you weren't out to take my job."
Spike says: "Forgive me?"
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo?"
Spike says: "Me."
Spike says: "Forgive me, Spike."
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "He forgives you, Spike."
Spike says: "Hey!"
Spike says: "How did you guys know where I was?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It was your ketchup-covered feet."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Owlowiscious discovered your footprints and we followed them all the way to the cave."
Spike says: "Oh yeah, the ketchup."
Spike says: "It looked pretty real though, didn't it?"
Spike says: "Uh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know Princess Celestia will wanna read about what happened today..."
Spike says: "I'm ready when you are."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why don't you write to Princess Celestia?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And tell her what you've learned?"
Spike says: "Really?"
Spike says: "Why, that's a big responsibility!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But nothing my number one assistant can't handle."
This is Spike, writing to you about my adventures. This week I've learned that being jealous and telling lies gets you nowhere in friendship. I also learned that there's plenty of love for every friend to share. So from here on out, I promise, that I, Spike, will... drops asleep.
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Spike."
Owlowiscious says: "Hoo?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Who?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You kno..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ohhhh..."
