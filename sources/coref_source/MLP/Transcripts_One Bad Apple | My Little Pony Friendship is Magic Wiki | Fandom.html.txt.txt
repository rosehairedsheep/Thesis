Apple Bloom says: "What to wear, what to wear?"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, what to wear?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Applejack says: "Scoot your boot, Apple Bloom."
Applejack says: "It's not like it's the Harvest Day Parade!"
Applejack says: "We're just goin' to the train station!"
Apple Bloom says: "Too casual."
Apple Bloom says: "Too summery."
Applejack says: "Your cousin isn't gonna care what you're wearin'."
Applejack says: "Just pick somethin'!"
Apple Bloom says: "This is my first time meetin' her, and she's from Manehattan."
Apple Bloom says: "I wanna make a good impression!"
Applejack says: "You know what would make a good impression?"
Apple Bloom says: "What?"
Applejack says: "Bein' on time to pick her up!"
Applejack says: "You got nothin' to worry about, sugarcube."
Applejack says: "Y'all are gonna get along great."
Applejack says: "You already have somethin' in common."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, yeah?"
Apple Bloom says: "What's that?"
Applejack says: "Neither of you have your cutie mark."
Apple Bloom says: "What?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "How could you forget to tell me somethin' like that?"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, this changes everything!"
Apple Bloom says: "Meet you at the train station!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm gonna go tell Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo!"
Applejack says: "You know, your cousin is supposed to sleep in here!"
Scootaloo says: "Do you really think she'll wanna join?"
Apple Bloom says: "She doesn't have her cutie mark."
Apple Bloom says: "Of course she'll wanna join the Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I'm just so excited I could burst!"
Apple Bloom says: "Is that the train from Manehattan?"
Applejack says: "Yep."
Apple Bloom says: "That's her!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, wait, no, no, that's not her."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh!"
Apple Bloom says: "No, tha-tha-that's her!"
Apple Bloom says: "Um, no."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, wait, tha– that's not her either, uh..."
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom, you've never met Babs Seed, remember?"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh..."
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah."
Applejack says: "Ah, that's her!"
Apple Bloom says: "Babs!"
Apple Bloom says: "Babs!"
Apple Bloom says: "It's me, your cousin, Apple Bloom!"
Apple Bloom says: "And this is Sweetie Belle, and this is Scootaloo, and we are so, so, so glad you're here!"
Sweetie Belle says: "This is gonna be the best week of your life!"
Scootaloo says: "Seriously, we are gonna have a blast."
Sweetie Belle says: "The Summer Harvest Parade's going on while you're here!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You'll get to ride in a float!"
Babs Seed says: "Really?"
Babs Seed says: "I've never been on a float before."
Apple Bloom says: "And we've got a really big surprise for you!"
Babs Seed says: "Yeah..."
Babs Seed says: "uh..."
Babs Seed says: "a surprise?"
Apple Bloom says: "I give you..."
Apple Bloom says: "the Cutie Mark Crusaders Clubhouse!"
Babs Seed says: "The Cutie Mark Crusaders?"
Scootaloo says: "A club devoted to helping ponies get their cutie marks!"
Scootaloo says: "We're its founding members."
Sweetie Belle says: "Technically, we're its only members."
Apple Bloom says: "But we're always looking to expand, and you seem like the perfect candidate!"
Babs Seed says: "I do?"
Scootaloo says: "Well, yeah, since you don't have a cutie mark and all."
Babs Seed says: "Oh, yeah..."
Babs Seed says: "That..."
Apple Bloom says: "Allow me to show you just some of the highlights of our clubhouse, should you choose to join us."
Apple Bloom says: "This is where we do our roll call..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Huh."
Apple Bloom says: "This is where we eat our lunch..."
Apple Bloom says: "Sometimes we stand here and think of great ideas."
Babs Seed says: "Yeah, uh..."
Apple Bloom says: "Uh, could you excuse us for a moment?"
Babs Seed says: "Sure..."
Apple Bloom says: "Thought she'd be more impressed."
Sweetie Belle says: "She's from Manehattan."
Sweetie Belle says: "If we wanna impress her, we need to really wow her!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Hmmmm."
Scootaloo says: "The float!"
Scootaloo says: "She can ride with us on our Summer Harvest Parade float!"
Apple Bloom says: "That's perfect!"
Apple Bloom says: "This really is a good spot for thinking up great ideas."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Mm-hmm."
Apple Bloom says: "Here it is!"
Apple Bloom says: "The official Cutie Mark Crusaders float for the Summer Harvest Parade!"
Scootaloo says: "As a member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, you'd be able to ride on it with us!"
Scootaloo says: "It'd be totally fun."
Diamond Tiara says: "More like funny..."
Diamond Tiara says: "..."
Silver Spoon says: "..."
Diamond Tiara says: "looking!"
Silver Spoon says: "looking!"
Silver Spoon says: "What is that thing, a giant orange?"
Apple Bloom says: "It's a pumpkin."
Diamond Tiara says: "More like a lame-kin."
Diamond Tiara says: "Who's the new blank flank?"
Apple Bloom says: "She's mah cousin, Babs."
Apple Bloom says: "She's from Manehattan!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Manehattan, huh?"
Diamond Tiara says: "Well, I guess you have that going for you."
Silver Spoon says: "Suppose you're gonna join their little club?"
Silver Spoon says: "What's it called?"
Silver Spoon says: "The  Cutie Mark Crusaders?"
Apple Bloom says: "Hey!!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Oooo, heh, big city attitude!"
Diamond Tiara says: "I like it!"
Silver Spoon says: "Mm-hmm!"
Babs Seed says: "Oh, yeah?"
Babs Seed says: "Well there's more where that came from!"
Babs Seed says: "Check this out!"
Scootaloo says: "Oh no, she didn't!"
Babs Seed says: "Looks like somepony's pumpkin just got squashed!"
Babs Seed says: "You gonna tell Applejack what?"
Apple Bloom says: "W-well, y'know, uh..."
Babs Seed says: "What're you, a snitch?"
Diamond Tiara says: "Come on, Babs, you should hang with us!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Y'know, the cool ponies, not these babies!"
Apple Bloom says: "What..."
Apple Bloom says: "just happened?"
Scootaloo says: "I think Babs just went to the dark side."
Sweetie Belle says: "We have to tell Applejack!"
Apple Bloom says: "No!"
Apple Bloom says: "We're not snitches!"
Scootaloo says: "Yeah!"
Scootaloo says: "And we're not babies!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Then..."
Sweetie Belle says: "why do I feel like crying?"
Scootaloo says: "I still can't believe she ruined our pumpkin float."
Apple Bloom says: "I still can't believe I'm related to such a big stinkin' bully!"
Sweetie Belle says: "What are we gonna do?"
Apple Bloom says: "We're gonna build a new float, that's what."
Scootaloo says: "Why bother?"
Scootaloo says: "She'll probably just ruin that one, too."
Sweetie Belle says: "We could always tell Applejack."
Babs Seed says: "What are you, a snitch?"
Apple Bloom says: "No!"
Scootaloo says: "No!"
Apple Bloom says: "We're not gonna be a bunch of tattle-tales!"
Apple Bloom says: "Besides, she's only here a couple of weeks."
Apple Bloom says: "We'll just avoid her like the plague until she goes home."
Scootaloo says: "Avoid her."
Scootaloo says: "Yeah, how hard can that be?"
Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Apple Bloom.
First, we thought that Babs was so really, really sweet.
A new friend to have, and it seemed like such a treat.
Scootaloo.
But then, we found the truth; she's just a bully from the east.
She went from Babs, yeah, to a bully and a beast.
Apple Bloom.
Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead.
Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo.
Babs Seed, Babs Seed, what we gonna do?
Got a bully on our tail.
Gotta hide, we gotta bail.
Babs Seed, Babs Seed, if she's after you.
Gotta run, we gotta flee.
Gotta hurry, don't you see?
Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad seed.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Apple Bloom.
Hiding from a bully, we know it isn't right.
But the Cutie Mark Crusaders, we aren't lookin' for a fight.
Scootaloo.
Oh, she'll go home soon, and then we'll have some peace again.
But for now, we're staying out of her way 'til then.
Apple Bloom.
Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead.
Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo.
Babs Seed, Babs Seed, what we gonna do?
Got a bully on our tail.
Gotta hide, we gotta bail.
Babs Seed, Babs Seed, if she's after you.
Gotta run, we gotta flee.
Gotta hurry, don't you see?
Why so mean? Why so crude?
Why so angry? Why so rude?
Can't you be nice? Can't we be friends?
Isn't it sad? Is this how it all ends?
Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad-.
Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad-.
Babs Seed, Babs Seed-.
Scootaloo.
She's just a bad, bad seed!
Babs Seed says: "Hey!"
Babs Seed says: "What're you doing at my clubhouse?"
Scootaloo says: "Y- y- your clubhouse?!"
Scootaloo says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "This is our clubhouse!"
Babs Seed says: "Well, it was yours, and now it's mine."
Silver Spoon says: "And mine."
Diamond Tiara says: "And mine."
Apple Bloom says: "That's not fair, Babs!"
Apple Bloom says: "We never did anything to you!"
Babs Seed says: "And let's keep it that way."
Babs Seed says: "Now scram, crybabies!"
Babs Seed says: "Bump, bump, sugar-lump, rump!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Bump, bump, sugar-lump, rump!"
Silver Spoon says: "Bump, bump, sugar-lump, rump!"
Apple Bloom says: "That Babs has really gone too far this time!"
Scootaloo says: "Kicked out of our own clubhouse!"
Apple Bloom says: "And my own bed!"
Scootaloo says: "Seriously?"
Apple Bloom says: "Super-seriously."
Sweetie Belle says: "We need to talk to Applejack."
Apple Bloom says: "No!"
Scootaloo says: "No!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Rarity?"
Apple Bloom says: "No!"
Scootaloo says: "No!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Twilight?"
Apple Bloom says: "No, no, no!"
Apple Bloom says: "We need to fight back!"
Scootaloo says: "Yeah!"
Scootaloo says: "Fight back!"
Scootaloo says: "How're we gonna do that?"
Pinkie's polka begins playing in background.
Apple Bloom says: "By makin' her the guest of honor at the Summer Harvest Parade!"
Scootaloo says: "Yeah!"
Scootaloo says: "Wait, what?"
Apple Bloom says: "Her face will be there!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Moo!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Moo!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Moo!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Moo!"
Babs Seed says: "Aheh..."
Apple Bloom says: "Are those from the Carousel Boutique?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Yup."
Apple Bloom says: "Excellent."
Sweetie Belle says: "Ooh!"
Scootaloo says: "Luster dust from Sugarcube Corner."
Scootaloo says: "They use it for decorating cakes."
Sweetie Belle says: "That must be what Rarity uses on her emergency edible boots!"
Scootaloo says: "The gears and bands for the moving mechanism, my tools and stuff..."
Scootaloo says: "Did you bring the thing from the place?"
Sweetie Belle says: "What's that?"
Apple Bloom says: "Granny Smith's kitchen timer."
Sweetie Belle says: "What's that for?"
Apple Bloom says: "C'mon, y'all, let's get to it."
Apple Bloom says: "We only got a few hours before mornin', and this thing has to look so good, Babs won't be able to resist wanting to ride in it!"
A-Team-like music.
Sweetie Belle says: "Is this it?"
Scootaloo says: "I think..."
Scootaloo says: "we're a go."
Sweetie Belle says: "Good, 'cause we'd better get out of here before Babs finds us."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Cutie Mark Crusaders, ho!"
Pinkie's polka plays in background.
"Roma" says: "Hot carrot crêpes!"
"Roma" says: "Get 'em here, get 'em hot!"
Babs Seed says: "Whoaaaa..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Isn't it smashing?"
Sweetie Belle says: "No!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I-I didn't mean smashing!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I mean..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Isn't it a hit?"
Sweetie Belle says: "No!"
Sweetie Belle says: "No, I- No!"
Sweetie Belle says: "No hitting!"
Scootaloo says: "Well, don't even think about riding it, Babs."
Sweetie Belle says: "Ow!"
Scootaloo says: "You had your chance."
Babs Seed says: "See ya later, Cutie Mark Crybabies!"
Apple Bloom says: "The timer set?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Teach her to fool with the Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Applejack says: "Y'all are letting Babs ride in your golden apple float?"
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah."
Apple Bloom says: "We thought she deserved to be the..."
Apple Bloom says: "center of attention."
Applejack says: "Well, that's just super sweet of y'all, makin' Babs feel so special."
Applejack says: "Y'know, after all the heartache she's been havin' in Manehattan."
Apple Bloom says: "Heartache?"
Applejack says: "Well, I didn't say nothin' 'cause I didn't want her to feel singled out, but there's been some bullies back in Manehattan just been teasin' her to pieces for her blank flank."
Apple Bloom says: "T-t-t-teased?"
Sweetie Belle says: "B-Bullies?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
Applejack says: "Yup."
Applejack says: "She came up to the farm to get away from all her problems back home."
Applejack says: "I'm so proud of y'all."
Applejack says: "You've done a good deed."
Scootaloo says: "So that's why she jumped in when Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon started giving us a hard time."
Apple Bloom says: "She didn't want to be bullied like at home, so she decided to be a bully instead!"
Sweetie Belle says: "And now we've turned into bullies too!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "What do we do?!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Nice float, Babs."
Babs Seed says: "Snagged it from those whiny baby blank flanks."
Diamond Tiara says: "Too cool for mule, Babs."
Apple Bloom says: "We gotta stop that float!"
Applejack says: "Huh?"
Applejack says: "What?"
Apple Bloom says: "We booby-trapped it!"
Scootaloo says: "Babs!"
Scootaloo says: "Bully!"
Scootaloo says: "Payback!"
Scootaloo says: "No time to explain!"
Scootaloo says: "We've just gotta get Babs out of that float!"
Spectator says: "Oof, my popcorn!"
Apple Bloom says: "Sorry!"
Scootaloo says: "'Scuse me!"
Scootaloo says: "Ah, whoops."
Apple Bloom says: "Whoa!"
Scootaloo says: "Pinkie Pie, let us in!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Funny joke!"
Apple Bloom says: "No, really!"
Apple Bloom says: "Let- us- in!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ohhh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Here!"
Apple Bloom says: "Babs!"
Apple Bloom says: "You gotta get out of that float!"
Babs Seed says: "You're not getting your float back, crybabies!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Veggie salad!"
Apple Bloom says: "Huh?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Veggie salad!"
Apple Bloom says: "Seriously?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't leave me!"
Apple Bloom says: "Babs!"
Apple Bloom says: "Babs!"
Babs Seed says: "Oof!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oooh, sweet applesauce!"
Apple Bloom says: "Maybe we'll get our cutie marks in stupidest ideas of all time."
Applejack says: "Are y'all okay?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Yeah..."
Sweetie Belle says: "we're fine."
Scootaloo says: "No sweat."
Babs Seed says: "After I'd been so mean to ya..."
Babs Seed says: "you saved me!"
Apple Bloom says: "About that..."
Babs Seed says: "I don't get it!"
Babs Seed says: "I saw it all happen!"
Babs Seed says: "You pushed me out just when the float was about to head into the lake!"
Scootaloo says: "Except..."
Scootaloo says: "we were the reason it was headed into the lake."
Sweetie Belle says: "We booby trapped the float."
Apple Bloom says: "Y'see Babs, we were tryin' to get you back for bein' a big bully..."
Scootaloo says: "But then Applejack told us about how you were being bullied back in Manehattan."
Sweetie Belle says: "And we figured out you were just doing it to avoid getting picked on in Ponyville."
Sweetie Belle says: "But, by then..."
Sweetie Belle says: "we were the ones being bullies."
Sweetie Belle says: "And..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh, why does life have to be so ironic?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "Guess what we're trying to say is..."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "We're sorry."
Babs Seed says: "I'm sorry too."
Applejack says: "Y'know, this all could've been avoided if y'all just came to me in the very beginning."
Sweetie Belle says: "That's what I kept on saying!"
Babs Seed says: "So..."
Babs Seed says: "can we..."
Babs Seed says: "start over?"
Apple Bloom says: "Definitely."
Scootaloo says: "Yeah."
Scootaloo playing timpani.
Sweetie Belle says: ""We, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, elect Babs Seed to join us as a sister, friend, confidaynte, alley, boss-om buddy, gal pal, compader, chum of chums..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Well you wrote this."
Scootaloo says: "Oh, uh, yeah..."
Sweetie Belle says: ""Homegirl..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Amiga..."
Sweetie Belle says: "" Blah blah blah blah blah."
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh, yes, here."
Sweetie Belle says: ""..."
Sweetie Belle says: "and fellow Cutie Mark Crusader!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You are solemnly sworn in, here this day, in witness of your fellow sisters, friends, confidantes..."
Sweetie Belle says: "boss-om buddies..."
Sweetie Belle says: "compadres..."
Scootaloo says: "Congratulations!"
Scootaloo says: "Gotta remember to revise that."
Apple Bloom says: "So you promise you're gonna start our Manehattan branch of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, right?"
Babs Seed says: "Yeah, and I promise to keep talking to my big sis about the teasing back home."
Applejack says: "Good."
Applejack says: "And if you have any problems, we've got your back too, y'hear?"
Diamond Tiara says: "So you're leaving huh?"
Diamond Tiara says: "Great!"
Diamond Tiara says: "Now we're stuck here with these lame blank flanks."
Babs Seed says: "Hey!"
Babs Seed says: "That's not how you talk to my friends!"
Silver Spoon says: "F-friends?"
Babs Seed says: "Yeah, you got a problem with that?"
Diamond Tiara says: "Well, what if I do?"
Diamond Tiara says: "What are you gonna do about it?"
Babs Seed says: "Tell your mothers about your bad attitudes!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I'm sure gonna miss that bad seed."
Applejack says: "Bad seed?"
Applejack says: "I thought y'all were friends now?"
Sweetie Belle says: "No, see, first we called her 'bad seed' as in actually a bad seed, but now she's bad as in good."
Sweetie Belle says: "Get it?"
Applejack says: "Yea..."
Applejack says: "No."
