Apple Bloom says: "Okay!"
Apple Bloom says: "let's see how your still life's comin' along, Kettle Corn!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, that certainly is..."
Sweetie Belle says: "round."
Kettle Corn says: "I can make it rounder!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm afraid that's all the time we have today."
Apple Bloom says: "We'll try somethin' else tomorrow."
Kettle Corn says: "But I like circle painting."
Scootaloo says: "And on the way to figuring out what you're meant to do, you'll find a ton more stuff you like."
Scootaloo says: "That's what makes looking for your cutie mark so great."
Apple Bloom says: "Mm-hmm."
Sweetie Belle says: "Mm-hmm."
Apple Bloom says: "Sorry, everypony."
Apple Bloom says: "We're closin' up shop."
Apple Bloom says: "We'll have to help you out tomorrow."
Foals says: "Awwww!"
Scootaloo says: "I don't know if we can help them tomorrow."
Scootaloo says: "Working with blank flanks one at a time takes forever."
Apple Bloom says: "If only there was a way we could help a whole herd of them at once."
Sweetie Belle says: "That would be perfect!"
Sweetie Belle says: "We'd save time and they could help each other!"
Scootaloo says: "Just like we used to!"
Scootaloo says: "Oh, but it'd have to be somewhere big enough to handle all those blank flanks."
Sweetie Belle says: "Somewhere outside, with tons of activities to try."
Apple Bloom says: "Are you two thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Cutie Mark Day Camp!"
Apple Bloom says: "And I know just the place, Applejack used to go there when she was little."
Scootaloo says: "Camp Friendship!"
Scootaloo says: "Oh."
Scootaloo says: "Sorry."
Scootaloo says: "I thought we were all gonna yell that one too."
Apple Bloom says: "Attention, all blank flanks!"
Scootaloo says: "And blank flank affiliates!"
Scootaloo says: "Come to our cutie mark day camp to find out what you're truly good at!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Bond with other blank flanks and find out what you're meant to do together!"
Scootaloo says: "Hey, Rumble!"
Rumble says: "Oh, hey, Crusaders."
Rumble says: "Look, I can't stop."
Rumble says: "I've gotta meet my brother for..."
Rumble says: "something."
Apple Bloom says: "No problem."
Apple Bloom says: "Just wanted to make sure you heard about our cutie mark day camp."
Apple Bloom says: "The first session's tomorrow."
Thunderlane says: "What'cha got there, little brother?"
Rumble says: "What?"
Rumble says: "Oh, nothing."
Rumble says: "Come on!"
Rumble says: "I want to show you a new dive roll I'm trying."
Scootaloo says: "Come one, come all!"
Scootaloo says: "Cutie Mark Day Camp is for blank flanks of all kinds!"
Thunderlane says: "Hmmm..."
Apple Bloom says: "Welcome, cutie mark campers!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Who's excited to be here?"
Foals says: "We are!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, we're excited too!"
Sweetie Belle says: "At Cutie Mark Day Camp, you'll be able to try all kinds of things!"
Apple Bloom says: "Kayaking!"
Scootaloo says: "Horseshoe-tossing!"
Kettle Corn says: "Circle-painting!"
Apple Bloom says: "You can try 'em all!"
Apple Bloom says: "But the most important thing is that you'll be tryin' them together."
Scootaloo says: "That's what worked for us!"
Thunderlane says: "Then I bet it'll work for these little guys too!"
Rumble says: "I thought you said we were gonna go practice for the Wonderbolts Ponyville Extravaganza show."
Thunderlane says: "I'm going to Wonderbolt practice."
Thunderlane says: "You're going to cutie mark practice."
Sweetie Belle says: "And we're glad to have you!"
Skeedaddle says: "I can't believe your own brother is a Wonderbolt!"
Scootaloo says: "U-Uh, Rainbow Dash is practically my sister, and she's a Wonderbolt too!"
Pipsqueak says: "Do you know Spitfire?"
Thunderlane says: "I know she'll be mad if I'm late."
Thunderlane says: "Now you have a good time and try some stuff."
Thunderlane says: "Who knows what you'll be good at?"
Apple Bloom says: "All right!"
Apple Bloom says: "Looks like we found the first activity of the day – the horseshoe toss!"
Thunderlane says: "Well, wish I could stay and play, but it's time to fly."
Thunderlane says: "Have fun!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Come on, Rumble!"
Apple Bloom says: "Step on up and show us how it's done!"
Kettle Corn says: "No way he's as good as his brother."
Rumble says: "Egh."
Rumble says: "Whoops."
Rumble says: "Aw, it looks like I won't be getting my cutie mark in the horseshoe toss..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Don't worry about it, Rumble."
Sweetie Belle says: "Hardly anypony finds their calling on the first try."
Rumble says: "Eh, I wasn't worried."
Scootaloo says: "Good!"
Scootaloo says: "'Cause there's a ton of other stuff to try."
Scootaloo says: "We'll find you something you're good at."
Rumble says: "Whoops."
Rumble says: "Whoopsie."
Rumble says: "Whoops."
The first and last lines.
Have five sy-lla-bles but the.
Mid-ddle has sev-en.
It's called a haiku.
Time to tell my brother this.
Camp isn't for me.
Scootaloo says: "Come on, Rumble."
Scootaloo says: "Isn't it fun just trying stuff?"
Rumble says: "Not really."
Haiku cutie mark!
And I never would have tried.
Without Skeedaddle.
Apple Bloom says: "That's what Cutie Mark Day Camp is all about."
Sweetie Belle says: "Working together and helping each other."
Kettle Corn says: "But I can still come back, right?"
Kettle Corn says: "And maybe paint some circles?"
Scootaloo says: "Of course!"
Scootaloo says: "Let's all meet right back here tomorrow."
Foals says: "Hooray!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Wow."
Sweetie Belle says: "I can't believe we got a cutie mark on the first day!"
Apple Bloom says: "Yup."
Apple Bloom says: "This camp was a pretty swell idea."
Apple Bloom says: "Everypony's really enjoyed it."
Scootaloo says: "Everypony except Rumble."
Scootaloo says: "He didn't have much luck with anything."
Sweetie Belle says: "Trying to find out what you're meant to do can be frustrating."
Sweetie Belle says: "You remember how long it took us to get our cutie marks?"
Apple Bloom says: "I remember the nightmares."
Scootaloo says: "Well, we can't let Rumble quit camp just because he didn't find something he's good at then."
Sweetie Belle says: "We'll just have to convince him to come back and try harder!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Mm-hmm!"
Wonderbolts motif.
Scootaloo says: "Hey, Rumble!"
Rumble says: "What are you all doing here?"
Scootaloo says: "We just wanted to apologize for not finding anything you liked today."
Rumble says: "Oh."
Rumble says: "Whatever."
Rumble says: "It's fine."
Apple Bloom says: "It's not fine."
Apple Bloom says: "It's frustrating, and we know what it's like."
Rumble says: "I'm not frustrated!"
Scootaloo says: "It's okay!"
Scootaloo says: "We've all been there."
Scootaloo says: "But we won't give up on helping you."
Sweetie Belle says: "We know you'll get your cutie mark."
Sweetie Belle says: "Everypony does."
Rumble says: "Actually, I don't need your help."
Rumble says: "Because I don't want to get my cutie mark!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "What?!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "I..."
Apple Bloom says: "I must have hay in my ears, because I thought I just heard Rumble say—"
Rumble says: "You heard right!"
Rumble says: "I don't want my cutie mark!"
Sweetie Belle says: "He said it again!"
Scootaloo says: "Not wanting a cutie mark is like not wanting to breathe!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Everypony wants to know what they're meant to do!"
Rumble says: "Hmph!"
Rumble says: "Not this pony."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Why?!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "!"
Rumble says: "Because cutie marks are silly, and..."
Rumble says: "a-and they just force you into one thing your whole life!"
Sweetie Belle says: "That's silly."
Sweetie Belle says: "Having a cutie mark doesn't mean you can't do other things."
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah!"
Apple Bloom says: "Our cutie marks are in helpin' other ponies with their cutie marks, but I still like makin' potions with Zecora."
Rumble says: "And when was the last time you did that?"
Apple Bloom says: "Um..."
Apple Bloom says: "I-I-I think it was, uh..."
Apple Bloom says: "Well, we've been pretty busy helpin' other ponies lately."
Rumble says: "Oh."
Rumble says: "You mean doing the thing you got your cutie mark for?"
Rumble says: "The thing you're stuck doing for the rest of your life?!"
Rumble says: "!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Okay."
Sweetie Belle says: "Maybe we will be doing that more than anything else."
Sweetie Belle says: "But we love being Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Rumble says: "Well, that's fine for you, but I'm not gonna be put in a box!"
Scootaloo says: "A blank flank who doesn't want a cutie mark?"
Scootaloo says: "That's gotta be the strangest thing I've ever heard."
Apple Bloom says: "Granny always says, "Some ponies have to find their own hay."
Scootaloo says: "Are you sure she didn't mean "find their own way"?"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh."
Apple Bloom says: "That would make more sense."
Sweetie Belle says: "I can't believe Rumble isn't interested in getting his cutie mark either, but we can't force him."
Scootaloo says: "And we've got a whole camp full of ponies who are interested in getting cutie marks."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Mm-hmm."
Rumble says: "Here he comes."
Rumble says: "The fastest, most elite flyer in Equestria!"
Thunderlane says: "Thunderlane!"
Rumble says: "Whoa!"
Rumble says: "Urgh..."
Rumble says: "I was gonna say me."
Rumble says: "You're not the only Pegasus in the family, you know."
Thunderlane says: "Oh, sorry, little brother."
Thunderlane says: "You're right."
Thunderlane says: "You might be the most elite flyer in Equestria some day."
Thunderlane says: "But for now, you should try other things, too!"
Thunderlane says: "Speaking of which, aren't you supposed to be at camp?"
Rumble says: "That camp is for losers who can't do anything."
Thunderlane says: "Great, so there's no pressure."
Thunderlane says: "You can try everything and not be worried about looking bad."
Rumble says: "I'm not worried about that."
Rumble says: "I just don't want to get a cutie mark in any of their ridiculous activities."
Thunderlane says: "Well, you're still going back tomorrow."
Thunderlane says: "You can't be a blank flank forever!"
Rumble says: "Huh..."
Sweetie Belle says: "All right, cutie mark campers, that's it for jam-making!"
Pipsqueak says: "But this is fun, and I didn't get my cutie mark yet."
Pipsqueak says: "What if I'm not good at anything else?"
Scootaloo says: "You don't get a cutie mark just because you're good at something or even because you like it."
Scootaloo says: "There's more to it than that."
Kettle Corn says: "I'm real good at painting circles, but I got my cutie mark in haikus."
Skeedaddle says: "Which is what I like!"
Skeedaddle says: "But..."
Skeedaddle says: "I'm still a blank flank like you."
Pipsqueak says: "So you can't get a cutie mark in something you like?"
Apple Bloom says: "Now, we didn't say that."
Rumble says: "You don't have to!"
Scootaloo says: "Rumble, you came back!"
Rumble says: "Say bye-bye to painting circles."
Rumble says: "You'll be too busy haiku-ing from now on!"
Kettle Corn says: "But..."
Kettle Corn says: "I like circles."
Apple Bloom says: "Come on, Rumble."
Apple Bloom says: "That's not how cutie marks work."
Pipsqueak says: "So that's how cutie marks work?"
Apple Bloom says: "Am I speakin' Olde Ponish?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "I just said it wasn't!"
Rumble.
Pfft, yeah, right!
They make you special in your way.
But that special mark that's just for you.
Will erase the stuff you liiiiiiike... to do.
Kettle Corn says: "So, no more painting?"
Skeedaddle says: "No more haiku?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Rumble, stop!"
Sweetie Belle says: "That's just not true!"
Rumble.
So you're good at charming snakes.
Too bad!
Or you bake delicious cakes.
Oh, well!
Maybe there are lots of things.
That you like to do.
Well, your options get pretty stark.
Once you got that cutie mark.
Blank flanks are better.
Nopony to tell you who you have to be.
Blank flanks are better.
Keep your spirit soarin' free.
So listen up 'cause I ain't lyin'.
Don't need no mark, so why keep tryin'?
If you like just bein' you.
Then keepin' that blank flank blank.
Is the thiiiiiiiing to do.
Scootaloo says: "Cutie marks don't limit you."
Apple Bloom says: "They only show you what you can do."
Pipsqueak says: "But..."
Pipsqueak says: "what if you can't do a thing?"
Pipsqueak says: "These cutie marks are frustrating!"
Foals.
Blank flanks.
Blank flanks.
Blank flanks.
Blank flanks.
Rumble.
You say there's nothin' you can do?
Foals says: "Yeah, exactly!"
Rumble.
A blank flank is the way for you.
It's no work to just be who you are.
No hunt to be some cutie star.
You're perfect just being you.
Don't bother with what you cannot do.
Rumble and Foals.
Blank flanks!
Rumble.
Nopony to tell you who you have to be.
Rumble and Foals.
Blank flanks!
Rumble.
Keep your spirit soarin' free.
So listen up 'cause I ain't lyin'.
Rumble and Foals.
Don't need no mark...
Rumble.
If you like just bein' you.
Then keepin' that blank flank blank.
Is the thiiiiiiiiiing to do!
Rumble says: "That's it, blank flanks!"
Rumble says: "Be proud of who you are!"
Rumble says: "You don't need some phony pony telling you you're just one thing!"
Rumble says: "Blank flanks forever!"
Foals.
Blank flanks forever!
Blank flanks forever and ever!
Blank flanks forever!
Blank flanks forever and ever!
Blank flanks forever!
Blank flanks forever and ever!
Rumble and Foals.
Blank flanks!
Pipsqueak says: "Whoopee!"
Apple Bloom says: "Now wait just an apple-pickin' minute, Rumble."
Apple Bloom says: "Where do you think you're leadin' our campers?"
Rumble says: "They're not your campers anymore!"
Rumble says: "I'm starting a new camp!"
Rumble says: "Everypony on this side of the line is in Camp Blank Flanks Forever!"
Scootaloo says: "Whoa-whoa!"
Scootaloo says: "You can't be a blank flank forever!"
Rumble says: "That's just the kind of talk I'd expect to hear from Camp Cutie Mark!"
Rumble says: "Which is why blank flanks need a camp where we can enjoy being blank flanks and appreciate our blank flankiness without being pressured to get a cutie mark!"
Scootaloo says: "Now hold on, everypony."
Rumble says: "Blank flanks forever!"
Foals says: "Blank flanks forever!"
Foals says: "Blank flanks forever!"
Foals says: "Blank flanks forever!"
Foals says: "Blank flanks forever!"
Sweetie Belle says: "What just happened?"
Scootaloo says: "Has everypony gone mad?!"
Scootaloo says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "In a word: yes."
Sweetie Belle says: "I just can't see what we did wrong."
Sweetie Belle says: "I thought everypony was having fun."
Apple Bloom says: "They were until that Rumble came and made a mess of things."
Apple Bloom says: "What are they doing now?"
Scootaloo says: "It looks like whatever they want."
Sweetie Belle says: "Honestly, it's not all that different from what they were doing here."
Apple Bloom says: "Then what was the point?"
Scootaloo says: "Point is that Rumble is a madpony who must be stopped!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Now calm down, Crusaders."
Sweetie Belle says: "We just need to talk to him again."
Sweetie Belle says: "The key is to remain calm."
Sweetie Belle says: "Cutie marks..."
Sweetie Belle says: "make you..."
Sweetie Belle says: "special!"
Rumble says: "By putting you in a special little box!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Special!"
Rumble says: "Box!"
Apple Bloom says: "Come on, Sweetie Belle."
Apple Bloom says: "I think you've "remained calm" long enough."
Sweetie Belle says: "Kettle Corn, you covered your cutie mark?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
I'm blank flank again,.
Keeping my options open.
I'm more than haikus.
Sweetie Belle says: "You just haiku'd right then!"
Rumble says: "Don't let them get in your head!"
Rumble says: "You're an open-ended question!"
Rumble says: "Blank flanks forever!"
Foals says: "Blank flanks forever!"
Pipsqueak says: "Blank flanks forever!"
Pipsqueak says: "Blank flanks forever!"
Pipsqueak says: "Whoa!"
Pipsqueak says: "You're cracking great!"
Skeedaddle says: "Thanks!"
Skeedaddle says: "Oh, no!"
Skeedaddle says: "What if I get a cutie mark in it?!"
Skeedaddle says: "!"
Rumble says: "Then you'll be stuck doing it forever!"
Rumble says: "Blank flanks, no more potential cutie mark activities!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, Cutie Mark Day Camp is a bust."
Apple Bloom says: "No, it isn't!"
Apple Bloom says: "It's a swell idea!"
Apple Bloom says: "We just can't seem to talk any sense into that..."
Apple Bloom says: "that Rumble."
Scootaloo says: "Maybe we can't, but I bet I know somepony who can."
Thunderlane says: "Lemme get this straight."
Thunderlane says: "My little brother up-ended your entire camp?"
Thunderlane says: "How in Equestria did he do that?"
Thunderlane says: "No, I don't."
Thunderlane says: "Rumble's good at all that stuff."
Apple Bloom says: "Well, that doesn't make a lick of sense."
Apple Bloom says: "Unless..."
Apple Bloom says: "he was bein' bad at stuff on purpose!"
Thunderlane says: "I was afraid of this..."
Scootaloo says: "Afraid of what?"
Thunderlane says: "Ever since I became a Wonderbolt, Rumble's either watching me or trying to fly like me."
Thunderlane says: "He won't do anything else."
Thunderlane says: "That's why I thought your camp was such a good idea."
Scootaloo says: "I don't understand."
Scootaloo says: "If Rumble wants to be a Wonderbolt someday, what's wrong with that?"
Thunderlane says: "Not a thing."
Thunderlane says: "But right now, he isn't even giving anything else a chance."
Apple Bloom says: "Sounds to me like Rumble isn't afraid of bein' put in a box at all."
Sweetie Belle says: "It doesn't?"
Apple Bloom says: "Nope."
Apple Bloom says: "I think Rumble's already picked out a box."
Apple Bloom says: "He's afraid he'll get a cutie mark that'll keep him from it."
Pipsqueak says: "I don't know how to say this, Rumble, but Blank Flank Forever Camp is kinda..."
Skeedaddle says: "Boring?"
Rumble says: "If we wanna stay blank flanks, we can't risk doing stuff."
Skeedaddle says: "What if I get a cutie mark in being bored?"
Scootaloo says: "Attention, blank flanks of Cutie Mark Day Camp!"
Sweetie Belle says: "The Cutie Mark Crusaders are pleased to announce today's special guest – Thunderlane!"
Thunderlane says: "Hey, everypony!"
Thunderlane says: "It's me!"
Apple Bloom says: "Anypony who's interested, gather 'round for a day of activities with a genuine Wonderbolt!"
Skeedaddle says: "Uh, sorry, Rumble."
Skeedaddle says: "But cutie mark or not, I'm not missing out on this!"
Foals says: "Whoa!"
Apple Bloom says: "All right, campers."
Apple Bloom says: "It's time for our last activity of the day."
Sweetie Belle says: "A Wonderbolt obstacle course!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Just like the one they'll fly through in their upcoming show!"
Scootaloo says: "But on the ground, since not everypony has wings."
Rumble says: "Thunderlane, aren't you gonna run the course?"
Thunderlane says: "Nope!"
Thunderlane says: "I know I'm a Wonderbolt and my cutie mark is all about moving fast, but I really like to cook!"
Rumble says: "Since when?"
Thunderlane says: "We take turns making the meals at Wonderbolts HQ."
Thunderlane says: "I didn't want to at first, but now I love it!"
Thunderlane says: "I just wish I'd tried it sooner."
Rumble says: "You do?"
Thunderlane says: "Of course!"
Thunderlane says: "There's more to me than just flying, and I bet there's more to you, too."
Obstacles are fun!
Running free through mud and dirt.
Beats circle painting!
Apple Bloom says: "That haiku pretty well sums it up."
Scootaloo says: "Looks like Thunderlane was right about the obstacle course getting Rumble to come back over."
Sweetie Belle says: "Hey, Rumble."
Sweetie Belle says: "Aren't you gonna do our Wonderbolt course?"
Rumble says: "I'm cooking today."
Rumble says: "Maybe I'll do the course tomorrow."
Apple Bloom says: "So you're comin' back tomorrow?"
Scootaloo says: "You're not worried about getting your cutie mark?"
Rumble says: "Nah."
Rumble says: "I already know I'm a good flyer."
Rumble says: "It kinda runs in the family."
Rumble says: "I guess it's time to see what other stuff I can do."
Thunderlane says: "Hm-hmm."
