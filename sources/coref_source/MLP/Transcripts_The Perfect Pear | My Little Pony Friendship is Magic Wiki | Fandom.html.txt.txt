Apple Bloom says: "Hmmm."
Apple Bloom says: "Thank you!"
Apple Bloom says: "You must be new."
Apple Bloom says: "I'm Apple Bloom."
Grand Pear says: "I'm Grand Pear."
Apple Bloom says: "Welcome to Ponyville!"
Goldengrape says: "You mean welcome back to Ponyville."
Goldengrape says: "Grand Pear was originally from here before he opened his famous pear jam store in Vanhoover."
Apple Bloom says: "Really?"
Apple Bloom says: "Why'd ya move back?"
Grand Pear says: "I, uh..."
Grand Pear says: "Well, I needed a change of pace."
Apple Bloom says: "Huh."
Apple Bloom says: "I can't believe I've gone my whole life without ever havin' this."
Grand Pear says: "Glad you like it."
Apple Bloom says: "How much?"
Grand Pear says: "Nah."
Apple Bloom says: "Wow!"
Apple Bloom says: "Thanks, Mr."
Apple Bloom says: "Grand Pear, sir!"
Apple Bloom says: "It was real nice meetin' you!"
Applejack says: "Glad you're back, sugarcube."
Applejack says: "Just in time for breakfast for dinner."
Apple Bloom says: "I got the perfect topper for flapjacks at the market today."
Applejack says: "Pear jam?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "What were you thinkin'?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "Quick!"
Applejack says: "Hide it!"
Apple Bloom says: "Huh?"
Apple Bloom says: "What's the big deal?"
Apple Bloom says: "It's just pear jam."
Applejack says: "The big deal is that there is a long-standing feud between the Apples and the Pears!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup!"
Apple Bloom says: "Why?"
Applejack says: "Why?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "..."
Applejack says: "Well, uh, a-actually, I-I'm-I'm not really sure."
Applejack says: "You have any idea, Big Mac?"
Big McIntosh says: "Uhhh..."
Big McIntosh says: "nope."
Apple Bloom says: "Then I guess we should ask Granny?"
Granny Smith says: "Ask me what?"
Applejack says: "Uh, what goes better with apple fritter flapjacks – caramel syrup or praline!"
Granny Smith says: "Praline."
Granny Smith says: "Oh-ho-ho, that smells great, Applejack."
Granny Smith says: "I'ma go wash up for supper."
Granny Smith says: "Be right back."
Applejack says: "Listen, sugarcube."
Applejack says: "Anytime Big Mac and I ever asked Granny about the feud or the Pears, she'd get so upset she couldn't talk."
Applejack says: "Best not bring it up."
Apple Bloom says: "O-Okay, but that Grand Pear was really nice to me, even though I'm an Apple."
Apple Bloom says: "I wonder what happened."
Applejack says: "Me, too."
Applejack says: "But if we can't ask Granny, I don't know who—"
Applejack says: "We can ask Goldie Delicious!"
Applejack says: "If anypony knows about the feud, it's the family historian!"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm in!"
Apple Bloom says: "What do you say, Big Mac?"
Apple Bloom says: "Siblin' trip first thing tomorrow?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup!"
Goldie Delicious says: "Now, that's how you make an entrance!"
Goldie Delicious says: "Or is it an exit?"
Goldie Delicious says: "Well, anyway, it's so wonderful to see you three."
Goldie Delicious says: "To what do I owe the pleasure?"
Applejack says: "Well, Goldie, we were hopin' you could tell us about the, uh..."
Applejack says: "feud with the Apples and the Pears."
Goldie Delicious says: "Oh."
Goldie Delicious says: "Oh, dear."
Goldie Delicious says: "Well, does Granny Smith know you're here?"
Apple Bloom says: "No, ma'am."
Apple Bloom says: "But I ran into Grand Pear yesterday, and he was real nice."
Apple Bloom says: "Maybe the feud was a misunderstandin' or somethin', and we can fix it?"
Goldie Delicious says: "Oh, well, I don't know about that, little one."
Goldie Delicious says: "But if it's a story you're after, I suppose you have a right to know."
Goldie Delicious says: "Now, let's see, I got a stack of books here someplace..."
Goldie Delicious says: "Oh!"
Goldie Delicious says: "Apple Family History, Volume 137!"
Goldie Delicious says: "Hmm, hmm..."
Goldie Delicious says: "Here we are."
Goldie Delicious says: ""Feud with the Bears"."
Goldie Delicious says: "I mean, "Pears"."
Goldie Delicious says: "My eyes ain't what they used to be."
Goldie Delicious says: "A long time ago, Sweet Apple Acres wasn't the only farm in Ponyville."
Goldie Delicious says: "In fact, there was another one just right next door."
Young Granny Smith says: "Come and get your apples!"
Young Granny Smith says: "Nothin' sweeter than bitin' into a crisp apple on a beautiful fall day!"
Young Grand Pear says: "Unless, of course..."
Young Grand Pear says: "..."
Young Grand Pear says: "you could bite into a juicy pear."
Young Granny Smith says: "Please."
Young Granny Smith says: "Pears are just what happens when you ain't no good at farmin' apples."
Young Grand Pear says: "Pears are nature's candy."
Young Grand Pear says: "Apples are sour."
Young Grand Pear says: "Like the expression on your face right now."
Goldie Delicious says: "And so it went."
Goldie Delicious says: "Granny and Grand Pear were always at each other on who was the best farmer or who took better care of their trees."
Goldie Delicious says: "If Granny read to her trees at night..."
Young Granny Smith says: ""And then, the little tree reached his branches up to the moon, and the moon said, 'Good night."
Goldie Delicious says: "..."
Goldie Delicious says: "why, then Grand Pear had special blankets made for his trees so they wouldn't get cold."
Young Grand Pear says: "Good night, trees."
Young Grand Pear says: "I've got you covered."
Young Grand Pear says: "Mm-hmm."
Apple family ponies grunting.
Goldie Delicious says: "In fact, all the Apples and the Pears were rivals to the core!"
Goldie Delicious says: "The only Apple and Pear who ever got along were Bright McIntosh and Pear Butter."
Young Bright McIntosh says: "Pssst!"
Young Bright McIntosh says: "I'm not supposed to talk to you."
Young Pear Butter says: "I'm not supposed to talk to you either."
Young Bright McIntosh says: "My mom says if you hold a buttercup under your chin, it'll make your chin glow."
Young Bright McIntosh says: "But it doesn't work on me."
Young Bright McIntosh says: "See?"
Young Pear Butter says: "Does it work on me?"
Young Bright McIntosh says: "It sure does, Buttercup."
Young Pear Butter says: "Buttercup."
Young Pear Butter says: "I like that name."
Applejack says: "Wait an apple-pickin' minute!"
Applejack says: "Bright Mac and Buttercup?"
Applejack says: "Those are our parents' names!"
Goldie Delicious says: "Of course Buttercup was just a nickname your father gave your mother."
Goldie Delicious says: "Pear Butter – well, that was her given name."
Applejack says: "Are you sayin' our mother was a..."
Applejack says: "Pear?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Big McIntosh says: "So we are half-Pear?!"
Big McIntosh says: "!"
Applejack says: "I can't believe it!"
Applejack says: "How did we not know?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Goldie Delicious says: "Well, uh, nopony called your mother Pear Butter."
Goldie Delicious says: "And her cutie mark was a preserve jar, but pear butter don't look too much different from apple butter, so no clues there."
Applejack says: "Is there a-anythin' else you can tell us about them?"
Goldie Delicious says: "I know they loved each other very much."
Goldie Delicious says: "They had that magical, star-kissed, other-side-of-a-rainbow kind of love."
Goldie Delicious says: "You couldn't be around them too long and, and not feel a little bit lighter than air yourself."
Apple Bloom says: "Anything else?"
Goldie Delicious says: "Hmm..."
Goldie Delicious says: "I'd need Volume 138 for that."
Goldie Delicious says: "I'm sure I could wrangle it..."
Goldie Delicious says: "in a, in a couple of days."
Applejack says: "That's all right, Goldie."
Applejack says: "It was..."
Applejack says: "nice just to hear—"
Goldie Delicious says: "Ooh-hoo-hoo!"
Goldie Delicious says: "I just remembered somethin'!"
Goldie Delicious says: "Your dad and his buddy Burnt Oak would get in all kinds of trouble together as colts."
Applejack says: "Burnt Oak?"
Applejack says: "The firewood salespony?"
Applejack says: "I haven't seen him in ages."
Goldie Delicious says: "He and your dad were thick as thieves back in the day."
Goldie Delicious says: "Y'all should talk to him."
Burnt Oak says: "Well, well, if it isn't the Apples."
Burnt Oak says: "What can I do for ya?"
Burnt Oak says: "I know you're not here for firewood."
Burnt Oak says: "You got more trees than anypony in Ponyville."
Applejack says: "You're right."
Applejack says: "We're not here for that."
Burnt Oak says: "Come to ask about your dad?"
Big McIntosh says: "Uh, eeyup."
Burnt Oak says: "I wondered if you might."
Burnt Oak says: "Hoped you would."
Burnt Oak says: "It's nice to talk about him."
Burnt Oak says: "We had a lot of laughs."
Burnt Oak says: "In fact, this one time..."
Burnt Oak says: "..."
Burnt Oak says: "we were racin' to see who could till the fastest, and Bright Mac was leavin' me in the dust."
Burnt Oak says: "He would've won, too, if he wasn't so..."
Burnt Oak says: "distracted."
Bright Mac says: "Whoa!"
Grand Pear says: "Oh!"
Grand Pear says: "Pear Butter, what did you do?!"
Grand Pear says: "!"
Pear Butter says: "I-I'm not sure."
Bright Mac says: "She didn't do it, sir."
Grand Pear says: "Excuse me?"
Bright Mac says: "The water silo."
Bright Mac says: "It was my fault."
Grand Pear says: "And you, come with me."
Grand Pear says: "No daughter of mine is gonna make goo-goo eyes at an Apple!"
Burnt Oak says: "Grand Pear never would've known it was your father's fault."
Burnt Oak says: "But there was no way he'd let your mother take the blame for somethin' he did."
Apple Bloom says: "So Dad was super honest!"
Apple Bloom says: "Apple doesn't fall far from the tree, huh, Applejack?"
Burnt Oak says: "Your dad worked the Apple farm all day and then headed over to the Pears on his breaks to fix the water silo."
Burnt Oak says: "I didn't see him for weeks!"
Burnt Oak says: "Not that he minded."
Burnt Oak says: "Gave him a chance to get to know your mom."
Apple Bloom says: "Did you know our mom, too?"
Burnt Oak says: "Buttercup was a real peach of a Pear."
Burnt Oak says: "But if you want to know more about her, you should ask Mrs."
Burnt Oak says: "Cake."
Apple Bloom says: "Mrs."
Apple Bloom says: "Cake?"
Burnt Oak says: "She and your mom were inseparable when they were fillies."
Applejack says: "Then let's go!"
Applejack says: "Thanks, Burnt Oak!"
Big McIntosh says: "Uh, would it be okay if we stopped by again sometime to hear more stories?"
Burnt Oak says: "I'd like that very much."
Mrs. Cake says: "Well, cinnamon sugar on toast!"
Mrs. Cake says: "All three Apple siblings!"
Applejack says: "Hi, Mrs."
Applejack says: "Cake."
Applejack says: "We heard you and our ma used to be real good friends, and we were hopin' you could tell us a bit about her."
Mrs. Cake says: "Oh, I would love to."
Mrs. Cake says: "I never knew the right time to bring it up."
Mrs. Cake says: "But I'm so glad you came!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Uh, for starters, did you all know that it was your mom who convinced me to pursue baking?"
Apple Bloom says: "But isn't your name Mrs."
Apple Bloom says: "Cake?"
Mrs. Cake says: "Not always."
Mrs. Cake says: "Back when I was Chiffon Swirl, heh, I had no idea what I was supposed to do."
Mrs. Cake says: "But one day, your mom brought me some candied pears, eggs, flour, sugar, and vanilla, and told me to just be creative!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Next thing I knew, I was whipping up pear upside-down cake, and I got my cutie mark!"
Mrs. Cake says: "It was like she knew what I was supposed to do long before I did."
Applejack says: "Just like you, sugarcube!"
Applejack says: "Or rather, you're just like her!"
Mrs. Cake says: "That was the first of many cakes for me, and Buttercup was with me through it all."
Mrs. Cake says: "She'd be my taste-tester, help with the decorating, and prep new ingredients."
Mrs. Cake says: "Over the years, I perfected my recipes."
Mrs. Cake says: "Your mom did so much for me."
Mrs. Cake says: "One day, I wanted to surprise her with a cake."
Bright Mac says: "Achoo!"
Pear Butter says: "Oh."
Pear Butter says: "It's just you."
Chiffon Swirl says: "Sorry."
Chiffon Swirl says: "I just brought you a little something to say thank you."
Chiffon Swirl says: "But I see you're busy."
Chiffon Swirl says: "Hah."
Pear Butter says: "Promise you won't say anything?"
Chiffon Swirl says: "You and Bright Mac?"
Chiffon Swirl says: "Whew, I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes."
Chiffon Swirl says: "Your families hate each other."
Pear Butter says: "I can't help it."
Pear Butter says: "We just sorta..."
Pear Butter says: "happened."
Mrs. Cake says: "Then Pear Butter told me the sweetest love story I have ever heard."
Bright Mac says: "Happy one hundred and thirty-one thousand, four hundred and fifty-six hour anniversary, darlin'."
Pear Butter says: "What?"
Pear Butter says: "That's way longer than we've been together."
Bright Mac says: "I know, but it's the anniversary of the first time I called you "Buttercup"."
Bright Mac says: "It's okay if you didn't get me anythin'."
Pear Butter says: "Actually..."
Pear Butter says: "I did."
Bright Mac says: "A guitar?"
Bright Mac says: "For me?"
Bright Mac says: "But..."
Bright Mac says: "I don't know how to play."
Pear Butter says: "Quiet, you."
Pear Butter.
We're far apart in every way.
But you're the best part of my day.
And sure as I breathe the air.
I know we are the perfect pair.
On a prickly path that goes on for miles.
But it's worth it just to see you smile.
And I cannot be pulled apart.
From the hold you have on my heart.
And even if the world tells us it's wrong.
You're in my head like a catchy song.
Bright Mac says: "Wow."
Bright Mac says: "It's just..."
Bright Mac says: "wow."
Pear Butter says: "Do you like it?"
Pear Butter says: "Be honest now."
Bright Mac says: "It's the best gift you could've given me!"
Pear Butter.
The seasons change and leaves may fall.
But I'll be with you through them all.
And rain or shine, you'll always be mine.
On a prickly path that goes on for miles.
You're the only one who makes it all worthwhile.
And you should not blame me, too.
If I can't help fallin' in love with you...
Bright Mac says: "Hey, no fair."
Bright Mac says: "I was gonna tell you the same thing."
Pear Butter says: "You're just mad I beat you to it."
Bright Mac says: "I'm tellin' ya, I was gonna pull you up, cover your eyes, lead you over here..."
Bright Mac says: "and say, "Surprise!"
Bright Mac says: "" And then you'd say,  And then I'd say I love you."
Bright Mac says: "Too bad it didn't work out though."
Pear Butter says: "Eeyup."
Pear Butter says: "Too bad."
Grand Pear says: "The Pears are moving!"
Applejack says: "I mean, I figured the Pears moved, but I didn't know all that stuff happened before with Granny and Grand Pear."
Apple Bloom says: "It must've been really hard on our parents."
Mrs. Cake says: "Oh, it was."
Pear Butter says: "We're moving?!"
Pear Butter says: "!"
Pear Butter says: "To Vanhoover?!"
Pear Butter says: "!"
Pear Butter says: "But that's so far!"
Grand Pear says: "It's what's best."
Grand Pear says: "There's acres of untouched land and a warehouse to make our jams."
Grand Pear says: "We'll get to expand our business and get away from those gosh-darned Apples."
Mrs. Cake says: "Pear Butter was devastated."
Mrs. Cake says: "But seeing no way out of it, she did what she had to do."
Bright Mac says: "So that's it?"
Pear Butter says: "What do you want me to do, Bright Mac?"
Pear Butter says: "We're movin'."
Pear Butter says: "I love you, but  I have to stay with my family."
Mrs. Cake says: "Then Bright Mac did the most romantic thing I've ever seen anypony do."
Apple Bloom says: "What?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "What?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Applejack says: "What?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "What did he do?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Big McIntosh says: "Tell us!"
Big McIntosh says: "Tell us!"
Mrs. Cake says: "We're gonna need one more pony to tell that story."
Apple Bloom says: "Mayor Mare, you knew our parents?"
Mayor Mare says: "Not as well as Mrs."
Mayor Mare says: "Cake, but I did play a part in their love story."
Mayor Mare says: "The night before the Pear family moved, Bright Mac asked me to meet him at the edge of Sweet Apple Acres."
Bright Mac says: "I don't want to be apart from you."
Bright Mac says: "Ever."
Bright Mac says: "I'm not sure what we'll do, but I'm sure of us."
Bright Mac says: "So sure that I'd marry you today."
Pear Butter says: "I would, too!"
Young Mayor Mare says: "I think that's my cue."
Mayor Mare says: "I had the honor of officiating your parents' secret wedding, and it was perfect."
Mayor Mare says: "Bright Mac knew Buttercup wouldn't want a big splash."
Apple Bloom says: "Reminds me of somepony else I know."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Mayor Mare says: "So they had a special way to seal their vows."
Young Mayor Mare says: "I now pronounce you—"
Granny Smith says: "What is goin' on?!"
Granny Smith says: "!"
Granny Smith says: "What's with all these here candles?!"
Granny Smith says: "!"
Grand Pear says: "Pear Butter!"
Grand Pear says: "Where are ya?"
Grand Pear says: "You're supposed to be packing!"
Grand Pear says: "What are you two doing?"
Bright Mac says: "Ma, Grand Pear, Buttercup and I are in love!"
Granny Smith says: "What?!"
Grand Pear says: "What?!"
Granny Smith says: "!"
Grand Pear says: "!"
Pear Butter says: "And we'll be married as soon as Mayor Mare says..."
Young Mayor Mare says: "Oh!"
Young Mayor Mare says: "I now pronounce you husband and wife!"
Pear Butter says: "Doesn't that feel nice?"
Granny Smith says: "What are you talking about, married?!"
Granny Smith says: "!"
Granny Smith says: "You two can't be married!"
Grand Pear says: "Finally, something we can agree on."
Grand Pear says: "Pear Butter, enough of this nonsense."
Grand Pear says: "We're movin'!"
Grand Pear says: "And you gotta stick with your family!"
Pear Butter says: "But..."
Pear Butter says: "the Apples are my family now, too."
Grand Pear says: "You can't be serious."
Grand Pear says: "Are you choosin' to be an Apple over being a Pear?!"
Grand Pear says: "!"
Pear Butter says: "Are you makin' me choose?"
Grand Pear says: "Yes."
Grand Pear says: "I am."
Pear Butter says: "Then yeah."
Pear Butter says: "I guess I am."
Grand Pear says: "Fine!"
Applejack says: "I can't believe Grand Pear just up and left Ma like that!"
Applejack says: "No wonder Granny never told us about any of this."
Mrs. Cake says: "These things are never easy."
Mayor Mare says: "And it's hard to know when it is a good time."
Applejack says: "It seems to me that now's as good a time as any."
Apple Bloom says: "To talk to both our grandparents."
Apple Bloom says: "Excuse me?"
Apple Bloom says: "Grand Pear?"
Applejack says: "I'm Applejack, and this here's Big McIntosh."
Applejack says: "But you already know who we are, don't ya?"
Grand Pear says: "Sure do."
Apple Bloom says: "Did you really move to Ponyville just for a change of pace?"
Grand Pear says: "No."
Apple Bloom says: "Then you came here because you're sorry and that you wanted to get to know us, too?"
Grand Pear says: "I'm..."
Grand Pear says: "so sorry."
Grand Pear says: "I-I-I was just so angry, and..."
Grand Pear says: "well, I-I never..."
Apple Bloom says: "It's in the past, Grand Pear."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh!"
Apple Bloom says: "Can I call you Grand Pear-Pear?"
Grand Pear says: "Sure can."
Granny Smith says: "Now where'd you all get to?"
Granny Smith says: "I ain't seen hide or hair of ya's all day."
Applejack says: "We've been all over."
Applejack says: "Learnin' about our parents."
Granny Smith says: "Guh..."
Granny Smith says: "Y-You have?"
Applejack says: "And our grandfather."
Granny Smith says: "So..."
Granny Smith says: "you're back, huh?"
Grand Pear says: "Sure am."
Grand Pear says: "Never should've left."
Apple Bloom says: "Findin' you and learnin' all about Mom and Dad, I feel like I found a piece of me I didn't even know was missin'."
Applejack says: "Hearin' their story makes me feel closer to them somehow."
Granny Smith says: "I'm sorry."
Granny Smith says: "I should've told you all about 'em sooner."
Grand Pear says: "And I should've been here."
Grand Pear says: "Ah, I can't believe I let a silly feud keep me from my family."
Applejack says: "Nothing's keepin' ya from us now."
Applejack says: "Let's not miss anythin' else."
Granny Smith says: "Applejack's right."
Granny Smith says: "Welcome back, prickly old pear."
Granny Smith says: "Heh."
Grand Pear says: "Thanks, you old crabapple."
Apple Bloom says: "Now that we're all together, there's somethin' we want to show you."
Apple Bloom says: "Mom and Dad left us somethin' to remember them by."
Apple Bloom says: "Come on!"
Grand Pear says: "Whoa."
Granny Smith says: "It's beautiful."
Grand Pear says: "It's..."
Grand Pear says: "impossible."
Applejack says: "If anything's gonna make it through, it's apples and pears."
