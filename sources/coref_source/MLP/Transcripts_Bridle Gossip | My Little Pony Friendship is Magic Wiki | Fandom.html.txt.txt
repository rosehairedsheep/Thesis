Twilight Sparkle says: "Wow, what a gorgeous day!"
Spike says: "Rainbow Dash must have gotten up early for once and cleared all the clouds away."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I bet all of Ponyville is going to be out enjoying the sunshine."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where is everypony?"
Spike says: "Is it some sort of pony holiday?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not that I know of."
Spike says: "Does my breath stink?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not more than usual."
Spike says: "Is it..."
Spike says: "zombies?!"
Spike says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "not very likely."
Spike says: "Not likely..."
Spike says: "but possible?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Psst!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Twilight!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Spike!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Come here!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Come!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Here!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hurry!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Before she gets you!"
Spike says: "Who?!"
Spike says: "!"
Spike says: "The zombie pony?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Z-Zombie pony?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "There are no zombie ponies."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie, what are you doing here alone in the dark?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm not alone in the dark."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay then, what are you all doing here in the dark?"
Applejack says: "We're hidin' from her!"
All gasp.
Apple Bloom says: "Did you see her Twilight?"
Apple Bloom says: "Did you see..."
Apple Bloom says: "Zecora?"
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom!"
Applejack says: "I told you never to say that name."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, I saw her glance this way..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Glance evilly this way."
Twilight Sparkle says: "..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And then a bunch of you flip out for no good reason."
Applejack says: "No good reason?"
Applejack says: "You call protectin' yer kin no good reason?"
Applejack says: "Why, as soon as my sister saw Zecora ridin' into town, she started shakin' in her lil' horseshoes."
Apple Bloom says: "Did not!"
Applejack says: "So I swept her up and brought her here."
Apple Bloom says: "I walked here myself!"
Applejack says: "For safe keepin'."
Apple Bloom says: "Applejack, I'm not a baby!"
Apple Bloom says: "I can take care of myself!"
Applejack says: "Not from that creepy Zecora."
Fluttershy says: "She's mysterious."
Rainbow Dash says: "Sinister."
Pinkie Pie says: "And spoooooky!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Will you cut that out?"
Rarity says: "Just look at those stripes!"
Rarity says: "So garish!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "She's a zebra."
Everyone but Twilight says: "A what!"
Everyone but Twilight says: "?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "A zebra, and her stripes aren't a fashion choice Rarity, they're what she was born with."
Applejack says: "Born where?"
Applejack says: "I've never seen a pony like that in these parts, 'cept..."
Applejack says: "her!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, she's probably not from here, and she's not a pony."
Twilight Sparkle says: "My books say that zebras come from a faraway land."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But I've never seen her in Ponyville."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where does she live?"
Applejack says: "That's just it, she lives in..."
Applejack says: "the Everfree Forest!"
Crash that sounds like a thunderclap.
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Spike says: "Uh, sorry."
Applejack says: "The Everfree Forest just ain't natural."
Applejack says: "The plants grow..."
Fluttershy says: "Animals care for themselves..."
Rainbow Dash says: "And the clouds move..."
Applejack says: "All on their own!"
Fluttershy says: "All on their own!"
Rainbow Dash says: "All on their own!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And that wicked enchantress Zecora lives there doing her evil..."
Pinkie Pie says: "stuff!"
Pinkie Pie says: "She's so evil I even wrote a song about her!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Here we go..."
Pinkie Pie.
She's an evil enchantress.
She does evil dances.
And if you look deep in her eyes.
She'll put you in trances.
Then what will she do?
She'll mix up an evil brew.
Then she'll gobble you up.
In a big tasty stew.
Soooo... Watch out!
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wow."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Catchy."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's a work in progress."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is all just a lot of gossip and rumors."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now tell me; what exactly have you actually seen Zecora do?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Well..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Once a month, she comes into Ponyville."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oooooh."
Rarity says: "Then, she lurks by the stores."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, my."
Fluttershy says: "And then, she digs at the ground."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, I'm sorry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But how is any of this bad?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Maybe she comes to town to visit?"
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah!"
Apple Bloom says: "Maybe she's just tryin' to be neighborly."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And maybe she's not lurking by the stores, maybe she's going to them, lurk free, to do some shopping?"
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah!"
Apple Bloom says: "Everypony likes to shop."
Apple Bloom says: "You know what I think?"
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom!"
Applejack says: "Hush and let the big ponies talk."
Apple Bloom says: "I am a big pony!"
Rainbow Dash says: "W-what about digging at the ground?"
Rainbow Dash says: "You've got to admit that's weird."
Fluttershy says: "What if she's digging for innocent creatures?"
Pinkie Pie sings "Evil Enchantress" in the background.
Twilight Sparkle says: "I am sure there is an explanation for everything Zecora does."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And if anypony here were actually brave enough to approach her, she would find out the truth."
Apple Bloom says: "Well, I'm brave enough; I'm gonna find out myself."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You ponies are being ridiculous!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, I heard that Zecora eats hay."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie, I eat hay; you eat hay!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah, but I heard it's the evil way she eats hay."
Applejack says: "Hey!"
Applejack says: "Where's Apple Bloom?"
Fluttershy says: "The door's open."
Rarity says: "She went outside!"
Rainbow Dash says: "And Zecora's still out there."
Applejack says: "That silly lil' filly!"
Applejack says: "I told her to stay put!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, you stay here in case Apple Bloom comes back."
Spike says: "Will do!"
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom?"
Applejack says: "You get back here right now!"
Zecora says: "Beware!"
Zecora says: "Beware, you pony folk!"
Zecora says: "Those leaves of blue are not a joke!"
Applejack says: "Y-you keep your creepy mumbo-jumbo to yourself, ya hear?"
Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity speak over each other against Zecora.
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh brother."
Zecora says: "Beware!"
Zecora says: "Beware!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, back at ya, Zecora!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You and your lame curse are the ones who better beware!"
Applejack says: "And you!"
Applejack says: "Why couldn't you just listen to yer big sister?"
Apple Bloom says: "I..."
Apple Bloom says: "I..."
Applejack says: "Who knows what kind of nasty curse Zecora could have just put on you?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Just like in my song!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You guys, there's no such thing as curses!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, that's interesting to hear coming from Miss Magic Pants herself."
Twilight Sparkle says: "My magic, real magic, comes from within."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's a skill you're born with."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Curses are artificial, fake magic."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's conjured with potions and incantations; all smoke and mirrors meant to scare."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But curses have no real power, they're just an old pony tale."
Applejack says: "Just you wait, Twilight."
Applejack says: "You're gonna learn that some pony tales really are true."
Pinkie Pie says: "She's an evil enchantress, she does evil dances!"
Zecora says: "Beware!"
Zecora says: "Beware!"
Pinkie Pie says: "If you look deep in her eyes, she will put you in trances!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rarity says: "Wicked, wicked zebra!"
Fluttershy says: "..."
Fluttershy says: "it's a curse."
Pinkie Pie says: "Then what will she do?"
Applejack says: "Just you wait, Twilight; some pony tales really are true."
Pinkie Pie says: "Then she'll gobble you up in a big tasty stew!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Soooo..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Watch out!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "what a dream..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Curses, schmurses."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Whoa!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Or she cursed my horn!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No no no no no!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "None of these books have a cure!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "There has to be a real reason for this!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "An illness?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "An allergy?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Spike says: "A curse!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I said a real reason."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Something that points to something real."
Spike says: "How about this one?"
Twilight Sparkle says: ""Supernaturals"?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, the word supernatural refers to things like ghosts and spirits and zombies, which are as make-believe as curses."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This book is just a bunch of hooey!"
Spike says: "But what if you're wrong, Twilight?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ah pfurse!"
Spike says: "A purse?"
Spike says: "How could it be a purse?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What happened?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pee pah Zthecora!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Sthe put a cursthe on me!"
Spike says: "Hey, say it, don't spray it, Pinkie!"
Rainbow Dash says: "she slapped us all with a-ow- curse!"
Rarity says: "I'm afraid I have to agree."
Spike and Twilight yell in surprise.
Applejack says: "I hate to say I told ya so, Twilight, but I told ya so!"
Spike and Twilight gasp.
Applejack says: "It's a curse, I tells ya!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But Fluttershy..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "seems just fine!"
Rarity says: "Yes, there doesn't seem to be a thing wrong with her."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Are you okay?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Is there something wrong with you?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Would you care to tell us?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "So..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "you're not going to tell us?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes you're not, or yes you will?"
Applejack says: "Good gravy, girl!"
Applejack says: "What's wrong with you?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Fluttershy says: "I don't want to talk about it."
Spike snorts, then bursts out laughing.
Spike says: "This is hilarious!"
Spike says: "Look at all of you!"
Spike says: "We got: Hairity, Rainbow Crash, Spitty Pie, Apple Teeny, Flutterguy, and..."
Spike says: "uh..."
Spike says: "I got nothin'..."
Spike says: "Twilight Sparkle."
Spike says: "I mean seriously, I can't even work with that."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is no joke, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now start looking for more books so I can find a cure!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I think we'll find a cure to this curse at Zecora's place!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's not a curse!"
Applejack says: "I agree with Dash!"
Applejack says: "We'll go to Zecora's and force her to remove this hex!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's not a hex either!"
Everyone but Apple Bloom and Spike shouting at once.
Apple Bloom says: "This is all my fault."
Apple Bloom says: "If I hadn't followed Zecora in the first place, none of this would have happened."
Apple Bloom says: "I just gotta fix this."
Applejack says: "Now where does she think she's goin' this time?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I don't care what you say, Twilight."
Rainbow Dash says: "It's time to pony up and confront Zecora."
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on, girls."
Rainbow Dash says: "Are you with me?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ah am-pft!"
Rarity says: "And I as well."
Fluttershy says: "Uh, I don't know."
Fluttershy says: "Seems awfully dangerous."
Rainbow Dash says: "How about you, Applejack?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Applejack?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pf-she's gone-pft!"
Rarity says: "Aah!"
Rarity says: "Or somepony stepped on her!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "or sat on her?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Rarity's hair!"
Rarity says: "Oh!"
Rarity says: "OH!"
Rarity says: "Pinkie, what are you doing?"
Rarity says: "Ah, really."
Rarity says: "Aah!"
Rarity says: "You ever hear of personal space?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Nopthe."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Apple Bloom is gone too!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I bet they went after Zecora."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well we better go find them."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Come on girls, let's go."
Rarity says: "Oh dear."
Rarity says: "Oh, this is so unseemly."
Rarity says: "Auuuaah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, a little help here?"
Fluttershy says: "Oopsie!"
Fluttershy says: "Sorry."
Rainbow Dash says: "OW!"
Fluttershy says: "Uh..."
Fluttershy says: "Spike?"
Fluttershy says: "Are you coming?"
Spike says: "Nope!"
Spike says: "Uh..."
Spike says: "gotta stay here and look for a cure."
Spike says: "Twilight Flopple!"
Applejack says: "Stop right there!"
Applejack says: "Turn around right now, missy!"
Apple Bloom says: "No."
Applejack says: "No?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "You can't ignore a direct order from your big sister!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hehehe."
Apple Bloom says: "Sorry, Applejack, but I'm the big sister now."
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom, you come back here right this instant!"
Applejack says: "I'm gonna tell Big McIntosh on you!"
Applejack says: "Aw, pony feathers."
Twilight Sparkle says: "C'mon girls."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We've got to get to Zecora's."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hurry!"
Rarity says: "Ooh..."
Rarity says: "Ahaha."
Rarity says: "Easier said than done."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, wait for me!"
Applejack says: "Rainbow!"
Applejack says: "Thank Celestia!"
Applejack says: "There's no time to lose!"
Applejack says: "I need to get to Zecora's pronto!"
Applejack says: "Giddy-up pony!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ex-CUSE me?"
Applejack says: "YEEE-HAW!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What the..."
Applejack says: "No, Rainbow Dash."
Applejack says: "Other way!"
Rarity says: "Oh."
Rarity says: "I look horrible!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Plis place plooks horrible!"
Rarity says: "Oh my."
Rarity says: "That place really does look horrible."
Rarity says: "Nice decorations, if you like creepy!"
Ponies gasp.
Pinkie Pie says: "Sthe sthtole my sthong!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Shthe shtole mm mm!"
Rarity says: "She stole your song?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh Pinkie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Doesn't sound anything like your song."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ah."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hmm..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Pbth!"
She's an evil enchantress.
And she does evil dances.
And if you look deep in her eyes.
She will put you in trances.
Then what would she do?
She'll mix up an evil brew.
Then she'll gobble you up.
In a big tasty stew.
Soooo... Watch out.
Rarity says: "You saw those terrible things."
Rarity says: "Now do you believe us Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Scary looking masks, confusing incantations, and a great big bubbling cauldron?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Everything is pointing to Zecora being..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "bad."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Or..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "what if Zecora is just making soup?"
Zecora says: "Mmm!"
Zecora says: "The perfect temperature for ponies, I presume."
Zecora says: "Now, where is that little Apple Bloom?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Or..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "what if she's making Apple Bloom soup?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What if she's making Apple Bloom soup?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Applejack says: "I'm comin' for ya, Apple Bloom!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Aaah!"
Applejack says: "Whoa there."
Applejack says: "Easy, Rainbow Crash."
Zecora says: "Oh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What have you done with Apple Bloom?"
Zecora says: "No!"
Zecora says: "No!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ahh!"
Zecora says: "Ponies!"
Zecora says: "What is this you..."
Zecora says: "No!"
Zecora says: "You know not what you do!"
Zecora says: "You've gone and spilled my precious brew!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We're onto you Zecora."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I didn't want to believe that you cursed us, but the evidence is overwhelming!"
Rarity says: "You made me look ridiculous."
Fluttershy says: "You made me sound ridiculous!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You made me speak ridiculous!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You ruined my horn!"
Zecora says: "How dare you!"
Zecora says: "You destroy my home, destroy my work, then rudely accuse me of being a jerk?"
Rainbow Dash says: "You put this curse on us, now you're gonna uncurse us."
Zecora says: "It is unwise to venture down this road."
Zecora says: "Your actions will make my anger explode!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where is Apple Bloom!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "?"
Apple Bloom says: "Zecora!"
Apple Bloom says: "I think I found all the things ya asked for."
Apple Bloom says: "What in Ponyville is goin' on here?"
Applejack says: "Apple Bloom!"
Applejack says: "You're okay!"
Apple Bloom says: "Why wouldn't I be?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Because Zecora is an evil enchantress who cursed us and was gonna cook you up into soup!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh Twilight."
Apple Bloom says: "Did those silly fillies finally get in yer head?"
Apple Bloom says: "You know there's no such thing as a curse."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Apple Bloom, sweetie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You can't just stand there and tell me this isn't a curse."
Apple Bloom says: "This isn't a curse."
Zecora says: "If you will remember back, the words I spoke were quite exact."
Zecora says: ": Beware, beware you pony folk."
Zecora says: "Those leaves of blue are not a joke."
Apple Bloom says: "It was a warnin'."
Apple Bloom says: "About that blue plant."
Apple Bloom says: "It's called Poison Joke."
Zecora says: "That plant is much like poison oak."
Zecora says: "But its results are like a joke."
Applejack says: "What in the hay does that mean?"
Zecora says: "It means this plant does not breed wrath."
Zecora says: "Instead this plant just wants a laugh."
Applejack says: "Will somepony please talk normal?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I think what she's saying is that when we ran in to save Apple Bloom, we ran into the poison joke."
Twilight Sparkle says: "All our problems are just little jokes it played on us."
Applejack says: "Little jokes?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "Very funny."
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay, fine."
Rainbow Dash says: "But what about the cauldron?"
Fluttershy says: "And the chanting?"
Rarity says: "And the creepy décor?"
Zecora says: "Treasures of the native land where I am from."
Zecora says: "This one speaks 'hello', and this 'welcome'."
Rarity says: "Not welcoming at all, if you ask me."
Zecora says: "The words I chanted were from olden times."
Zecora says: "Something you call a nursery rhyme."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But the cauldron..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The Apple Bloom soup?"
Apple Bloom says: "Lookie here Twilight."
Apple Bloom says: "That pot of water wasn't for me, it was for all these herbal ingredients."
Apple Bloom says: "The cure for poison joke is a simple old-natural remedy."
Apple Bloom says: "You just gotta take a bubble bath!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But I tried to find a cure in all my books and couldn't find anything."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What book has this natural remedy?"
Zecora says: "Here is the book, you see?"
Zecora says: "Sad that you lack it in your library."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Actually, I do have this book, but I didn't look inside because the title was so..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Weird."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Supernaturals: Natural Remedies and Cure-alls That Are Simply Super."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm so sorry, Zecora."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I had the answer the whole time, if only I had bothered to look inside."
Zecora says: "Maybe next time you will take a second look, and not judge the cover of the book."
Apple Bloom says: "Hahaha."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Zecora?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Would you be kind enough to mix up another batch of the herbal bath?"
Zecora says: "Mix it up I certainly will."
Zecora says: "Yet I am missing an herb from Ponyville."
Apple Bloom says: "But whenever Zecora comes to town, all the shops are mysteriously closed."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, well..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I think we can help you with that."
Daisy says: "Look Rose!"
Daisy says: "How awful!"
Rose says: "The wicked enchantress has cursed them all."
Lily Valley says: "The horror, the horror!"
Ponies panicking.
Daisy says: "Run, ponies!"
Daisy says: "Run!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Daisy, we need to talk."
My friends says: "Never judge a book by its cover."
I all learned an important lesson this week says: "Never judge a book by its cover."
My friends says: "Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary."
I all learned an important lesson this week says: "Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary."
My friends says: "But you have to look past that and learn who they are inside."
I all learned an important lesson this week says: "But you have to look past that and learn who they are inside."
My friends says: "Real friends don't care what your "cover" is; it's the "contents" of a pony that count."

Your faithful student,.
Twilight Sparkle.
Lotus Blossom says: "Miss Zecora, I would love to get the recipe for this bath."
Lotus Blossom says: "It's simply luxurious!"
Apple Bloom says: "Applejack!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hey, where's Applejack?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Applejack says: "I'm right here, little sis."
Applejack says: "I ain't tiny no more!"
Rarity says: "Oh!"
Rarity says: "I have never felt so lovely in all my life!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, my gosh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I never realized how horrible it is not to be able to talk."
Pinkie Pie says: "I mean, I love talking so much, and when I couldn't talk anymore, my tongue was all 'ehhhh'!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It was the worst!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't you agree, Fluttershy?"
Fluttershy says: "..."
Fluttershy says: "Yes."
