Pinkie Pie says: "Okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "All we need is a dot of salt, a dab of sugar, and a spritz of ginger."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Are those real measurements?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "How do you keep track without a recipe?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pie baking is more art than science."
Pinkie Pie says: "And this will be my masterpiece!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's to celebrate Rainbow Dash's seventy-third Wonderbolt training session!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Seventy-third?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's specific."
Pinkie Pie says: "I know!"
Pinkie Pie says: "The pie is blueberry because Wonderbolt outfits are blue."
Pinkie Pie says: "The crust is rainbow, for obvious reasons."
Pinkie Pie says: "But the most special part is the seventy-three super secret sweets and spices that represent each training session!"
Pinkie Pie says: "brown sugar, pink sugar, sweetroot, apple jelly, berry mash, and a towel?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You sure are going to a lot of trouble for Rainbow Dash's pie."
Pinkie Pie says: "Phew!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's because I know how much she loves them!"
Pinkie Pie says: "My pies are her favorite!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's worth all the trouble to see her happy."
Pinkie Pie says: "Now I'm going to need some cocoa powder, cocoa flakes—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Cocoa bar!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Want some?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Isn't that for the pie?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Break time's over!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Now let's finish this pie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, choo-choo!"
Wonderbolts theme.
Spitfire says: "Good training, everypony."
Spitfire says: "Nice work, Crash."
Spitfire says: "You really added that sparkle to that pressure diamond-drop."
Pinkie Pie says: "Surprise!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Happy seventy-third Wonderbolt training session!"
Rainbow Dash says: "My seventy-third training session?"
Rainbow Dash says: "That's specific."
Pinkie Pie says: "I know!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm just so proud and happy for you, and I've been counting all your training sessions, and I was going to wait until your hundredth, but I got too excited, and I know how much you love pie, so happy seventy-third training session!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whaaa?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You didn't have to do this."
Pinkie Pie says: "I know I didn't have to, but I reeeally wanted to!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Have a bite."
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What's that?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Guess it was nothing."
Rainbow Dash says: "But wow, heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "This pie is the best I've ever had!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Mmm!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Is that cinnamon?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I knew you'd love it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Have more."
Pinkie Pie says: "I made the whole thing for you."
Rainbow Dash says: "Really?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, that's so great!"
Rainbow Dash says: "But I need to go change."
Rainbow Dash says: "A-And then I have to take Tank to the vet."
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "His sensitive tortoise tummy's been acting up again."
Rainbow Dash says: "Do you mind if I take this pie with me?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Of course not!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I gotta get back to my shift at Sugarcube Corner anyway."
Pinkie Pie says: "Congratulations again!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Thanks."
Pinkie Pie says: "Is that..."
Pinkie Pie says: "?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is that..."
Pinkie Pie says: "?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Stop!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You didn't see a blueberry rainbow-crust seventy-three-ingredient pie with a slice eaten out of it in here, did you?"
Janitor Pony says: "Uh..."
Janitor Pony says: "n-no?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Right."
Pinkie Pie says: "Of course you didn't."
Pinkie Pie says: "That would be ridiculous."
Pinkie Pie says: "Because I made it for Rainbow Dash, and she loves my pies."
Pinkie Pie says: "She would never throw them away like trash in the trash with other trash, right?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Right?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Janitor Pony says: "Um..."
Janitor Pony says: "riiight?"
Batman-style scene wipe.
Pinkie Pie says: "Hmmm..."
Pinkie Pie says: "That pie couldn't have been the one I made."
Pinkie Pie says: "I must be seeing things."
Pinkie Pie says: "I did have a lot of chocolate this morning."
Pinkie Pie says: "Unless Rainbow Dash's been replaced by an imposter who throws delicious pies away!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Or..."
Pinkie Pie says: "has she been brainwashed by a pie-hating evil queen?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You make a good point."
Pinkie Pie says: "Rainbow Dash is too stubborn to be brainwashed."
Pinkie Pie says: "Plus she hates washing."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hmm."
Pinkie Pie says: "There's something else going on here."
Pinkie Pie says: "Let's look up a few of the more recent pies I've made for her."
Pinkie Pie says: "The boysenberry pie I made for her birthday..."
Pinkie Pie says: "and her three half-birthday lemon meringues..."
Pinkie Pie says: "and the "It's Not Your Birthday But Here's a Pie Anyway Day" custard pie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "She ate all of these..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Right?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Another pie!"
Rainbow Dash says: "?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Thank you so much!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What's that?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Guess it was nothing."
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh-heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Awesome!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Three lemon meringues?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, what's that over there?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, never mind."
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Great pies!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Happy "It's Not Your Birthday But Here's a Pie Anyway" Day!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Thank you!"
Rainbow Dash says: "No way!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Check that out!"
Shoeshine says: "Oh!"
Shoeshine says: "It's not even my birthday!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, sorry."
Rainbow Dash says: "Guess it was nothing."
Rainbow Dash says: "Mmm!"
Rainbow Dash says: "But that custard was everything!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Have I ever really seen Rainbow Dash eat one of my pies?"
Pinkie Pie says: "And do I always look when somepony points behind me?"
Pinkie Pie says: "What's there?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Heh."
Pinkie Pie says: "Good one."
Pinkie Pie says: "But I need answers."
Pinkie Pie says: "I've sent Rainbow Dash a pie every month she's been a Wonderbolt, and you're telling me you've never seen her eat one?"
Spitfire says: "Uhhh..."
Soarin says: "Uhhh..."
Fleetfoot says: "Uhhh..."
Spitfire says: "Uh, affirmative."
Spitfire says: "Or, uh, negative."
Spitfire says: "Um..."
Spitfire says: "I-I-I mean, she wasn't seen eating one."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hmm..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Interesting."
Pinkie Pie says: "Very interesting."
Spitfire says: "Are we under investigation?"
Pinkie Pie says: "As chief detective on the pie case, I've labeled you all ponies-of-interest."
Pinkie Pie says: "So it's best you tell me everything you know."
Spitfire says: "Well, we have been getting mysterious monthly pie donations."
Pinkie Pie says: "Would you be able to pick these pies out of a line up?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I hear Rainbow Dash's pet tortoise Tank has been having tummy troubles."
Pinkie Pie says: "When did it start?"
Dr. Fauna says: "About a week ago."
Dr. Fauna says: "Poor Tank had all the telltale signs of sugar overload – jittery shell, sleeplessness, reptilian indigestion."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hmmm..."
Pinkie Pie says: "And this all happened the day after I made Rainbow Dash a "Thanks For Lending Me Your Jacket" peach pie."
Pinkie Pie says: "It seems the pieces of the puzzle are plopping into place, but the picture isn't pretty."
Pinkie Pie says: "Note to self – P."
Pinkie Pie says: "Alliteration Pie."
Pinkie Pie says: "Is that everything, Doctor?"
Dr. Fauna says: "Well, there's also this."
Pinkie Pie says: "Interesting."
Pinkie Pie says: "Did you have the lab analyze the flavor of that pie?"
Dr. Fauna says: "No."
Dr. Fauna says: "But you know, Miss Cheerilee was in here not long ago."
Dr. Fauna says: "The class hamster was having similar symptoms."
Dr. Fauna says: "Perhaps it's a pie pandemic!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Perhaps."
Pinkie Pie says: "And I just might know Pony Patient Zero!"
Cheerilee says: "Dr."
Cheerilee says: "Fauna's right."
Cheerilee says: "I do always have to remind the foals and fillies not to share the pies with the class hamster."
Cheerilee says: "Animals just can't digest pony food."
Pinkie Pie says: "Indeed."
Pinkie Pie says: "But where do these pies come from?"
Cheerilee says: "Well, they're from Rainbow Dash."
Cheerilee says: "She drops off her "Day After Rainbow Dash's Half-Birthday" pie every year."
Pinkie Pie says: "Did you say the day after her half-birthday?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Very, very interesting."
Pinkie Pie says: "Because I give her a pie on her half-birthday every year!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And I have a feeling it's the same pie."
Cheerilee says: "Well, wherever it comes from, the students just love it."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm so glad."
Pinkie Pie says: "At least I can be sure somepony is."
Pinkie Pie says: "She didn't eat the blueberry."
Pinkie Pie says: "She didn't eat the banana."
Pinkie Pie says: "She didn't eat the cream, and she didn't eat the chocolate."
Pinkie Pie says: "She didn't eat any of 'em!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Why?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And don't tell me this all just started recently!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's been going on for years!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Cheerilee said so herself."
Pinkie Pie says: "If there's one thing I know, you can't escape the truth!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Rainbow Dash doesn't like pie, and she's been lying to me about it the whole time!"
Applejack says: "Pinkie Pie?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "Pinkie Pie!"
Applejack says: "Whooooaaaa!"
Applejack says: "Oh."
Applejack says: "Party-planning cave."
Applejack says: "Right."
Applejack says: "You okay?"
Applejack says: "Or are you just screamin' for fun?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Screaming is fun."
Pinkie Pie says: "But I'm not okay!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I've been making Rainbow Dash pies for years, but she doesn't even like them."
Pinkie Pie says: "She's been lying to me!"
Applejack says: "But everypony loves your pies."
Applejack says: "They're the greatest thing since sliced apples."
Pinkie Pie says: "Thank you!"
Applejack says: "And I could swear I've seen her eat one of your pies before."
Pinkie Pie says: "Have you reeeaaally?"
Applejack says: "Um, I..."
Applejack says: "thought I had."
Applejack says: "That's why I said it?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Are you sure?"
Applejack says: "Maybe I haven't..."
Applejack says: "?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Exactly!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Because it's all been a sham!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Rainbow Dash has been laughing at my pies behind my back and scheming of a way to get rid of them for years!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Bring forth the worst-tasting food in all of Equestria!"
Rainbow Dash says: "And now I will destroy Pinkie Pie's horrid abominations, freeing the land of these disgusting pies forever!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Nooooooo!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Good riddance, strawberry cream and peaches 'o plenty!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Begone, apple crumble and lemon surprise!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Gone!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Gone!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Gone!"
Applejack says: "I really don't think that's what's happening."
Pinkie Pie says: "I don't think so either."
Pinkie Pie says: "I know so."
Applejack says: "Well, I've got just the thing to get your mind off all this madness."
Applejack says: "We've had a great apple harvest, so I was hopin' you could whip up a few of your delicious pies."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yes."
Pinkie Pie says: "I will make pies."
Pinkie Pie says: "Lots of pies."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm going to make Rainbow Dash so many pies, it'll force her to admit the truth."
Pinkie Pie says: "Or I'll catch her in the act of getting rid of them."
Pinkie Pie says: "Operation: "Pie of Lies" is a go."
Pinkie Pie says: "Thanks, Applejack."
Pinkie Pie says: "I knew I could count on you to come up with a plan."
Applejack says: "I don't think that's what I did."
Applejack says: "Also, uh..."
Applejack says: "how do you get out of here?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Surprise!"
Rainbow Dash says: "W-W-What's happening?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Happy unofficial "Wake Your Friends Up" Day!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh."
Rainbow Dash says: "I've never heard of "Wake Your Friends Up" Day."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, it's unofficial."
Pinkie Pie says: "But I made you your favorite pie in celebration!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ta-da!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Gifts are the second most important part of "Wake Your Friends Up" Day."
Rainbow Dash says: "What's the first most important part?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Accepting the gifts and enjoying them immediately."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, I'm sorry I forgot about "Wake Your Friends Up" Day."
Rainbow Dash says: "Let me make it up to you."
Rainbow Dash says: "Here!"
Pinkie Pie says: "The pie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Where'd it go?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What do you mean where did it go?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh-heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Mmm-mmm."
Pinkie Pie says: "How—"
Pinkie Pie says: "?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Where—"
Pinkie Pie says: "?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "When—"
Pinkie Pie says: "?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Congratulations on your seventy-fourth Wonderbolt training session!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Here's a pie."
Pinkie Pie says: "Now eat it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay, this is getting a little out of hoof."
Rainbow Dash says: "I haven't even trained yet."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, I wanted to pre-celebrate because I already know how great you're gonna do."
Pinkie Pie says: "Eat the pie!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie, look out!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm not gonna fall for—"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Are you okay?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Get me down!"
EMT Pony says: "Sorry, ma'am, but we have to make sure you didn't sustain any internal injuries."
Pinkie Pie says: "But the pie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What happened to the pie?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "The pie was delicious!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You just get better!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Noooooooo!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Somepony help me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Rainbow Dash, thank goodness you're here!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I was trying to fix the top pie on my pie pyramid, but the whole thing became unstable."
Pinkie Pie says: "And there's only one way to save me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You have to eat the pies!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't worry, I got ya!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, right."
Pinkie Pie says: "Or you could save me that way."
Rainbow Dash says: "You gotta be more careful, okay?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Rrgh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I wanted to thank you for saving me from the pie pyramid, so have a pie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Have three!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Have fifteen!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I know how much you love them!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Now eat up!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Thanks!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I can't wait to eat  all these pies!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What!"
Pinkie Pie says: "?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Where did they—"
Pinkie Pie says: "?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "How did you—"
Pinkie Pie says: "?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Delicious!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You did it again, Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Rainbow Dash, there you are!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I made a pie for everypony, and you're the only one who hasn't eaten hers yet."
Pinkie Pie says: "So here."
Pinkie Pie says: "Your pie."
Pinkie Pie says: "For you to eat."
Pinkie Pie says: "Now."
Rainbow Dash says: "Are you okay?"
Rainbow Dash says: "You seem to be staring more than usual."
Pinkie Pie says: "I just really like to watch others enjoy my pies."
Rainbow Dash says: "You sure you don't have to blink?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Me?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Nope."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm not much of a blinker."
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't mind me."
Pinkie Pie says: "Go ahead and take a bite."
Rainbow Dash says: "Well..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Do I want to take a big bite or a small bite..."
Rainbow Dash says: "?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I just don't know..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Or maybe medium?"
Rainbow Dash says: "No, no, no."
Rainbow Dash says: "Definitely not medium."
Pinkie Pie says: "Just try some."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ahhhh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Do you have any milk?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ah, never mind."
Rainbow Dash says: "Your pies are just too good to resist."
Pinkie Pie says: "What?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I can't take it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, everything okay, Pinkie?"
Pinkie Pie says: "No!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Everything is not okay!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You hate my pies!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What are you talking about?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You know exactly what I'm talking about!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I saw what you did!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, I didn't see what you did."
Pinkie Pie says: "But I know that you've been fake-eating my pies!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You threw away the pie I made for your seventy-third Wonderbolt training session, and I know you secretly somehow got rid of all the other pies I gave you!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Admit it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "That's crazy!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What do you think I did?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Somehow make them all disappear into thin air?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay."
Rainbow Dash says: "So maybe I made one of them disappear into thin air."
Pinkie Pie says: "How could you?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I, uh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I-I just wanted to share these amazing pies with the folks of Cloudsdale!"
Rainbow Dash says: "So I, uh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I was trying to send them up via..."
Rainbow Dash says: "balloon mail."
Pinkie Pie says: "But you just said they were delicious."
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, obviously that's because..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I have amnesia!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I've been brainwashed!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I-It's Opposite Day?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Your memory is working fine, you hate washing, and I know today's not Opposite Day because I baked you a pie for it every year."
Pinkie Pie says: "A pie that you'd probably just throw away."
Pinkie Pie says: "Or give to charity."
Pinkie Pie says: "Or destroy with your laser eyes while laughing at me!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Laser eyes?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "So you admit it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What?"
Rainbow Dash says: "No!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I can explain!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I don't want to hear it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "She won't listen to me."
Rainbow Dash says: "She won't let me apologize."
Rainbow Dash says: "I feel terrible."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, you have been lying to her."
Twilight Sparkle says: "To all of us, actually."
Applejack says: "Yeah."
Applejack says: "Is there anything else you're lyin' about that we should know?"
Rainbow Dash says: "No!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, not that I can think of off the top of my head."
Rainbow Dash says: "Is it my fault that I don't like pies?"
Rainbow Dash says: "And not just Pinkie's pies."
Rainbow Dash says: "All pies!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I know how much she loves making pies, and if I told her I didn't like them, it would have crushed her."
Applejack says: "Uh, you kinda crushed her anyway."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, but I..."
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wait!"
Rainbow Dash says: "That's it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I know how I can make it up to her!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pee-yew!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Gummy, is that you?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Huh."
Pinkie Pie says: "What is that?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's you."
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie Pie, wait!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I know now that I should've been honest with you from the start, because lying to your friends is wrong."
Rainbow Dash says: "And because getting rid of all those pies was a giant hassle."
Rainbow Dash says: "I mean, do you have any idea how many pies you've made for me over the years?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yes, I know exactly how many."
Pinkie Pie says: "I have a very detailed pie-ling system."
Rainbow Dash says: "Of course you do."
Rainbow Dash says: "The point is I thought the hassle was worth it just to spare your feelings, but I was wrong."
Rainbow Dash says: "So to make up for it, I made this pie for you."
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, I guess I made it for me."
Rainbow Dash says: "To eat in front of you."
Rainbow Dash says: "Point is I'm eating this pie for friendship!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait."
Pinkie Pie says: "That smelly circular monstrosity is a pie?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I know I can't go back and eat all the pies you made for me in the past, so instead I'm going to eat this one giant one for you now."
Rainbow Dash says: "So here I go."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ahhhh..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I can't watch you do this!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I mean, is that crust or some kind of concrete?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, honestly, I have no idea."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, I can't believe you're willing to eat this terrible pie for me."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's ridiculous, and this whole thing is overly complicated, and..."
Pinkie Pie says: "I think I finally understand why you lied."
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What's that?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Guess it was nothing."
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh-heh."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm so glad you enjoyed my pies!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, never mind."
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Great pies!"
Rainbow Dash says: "No way!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Check that out!"
Shoeshine says: "Oh!"
Shoeshine says: "It's not even my birthday!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, sorry."
Rainbow Dash says: "Guess it was nothing."
Rainbow Dash says: "Mmm!"
Rainbow Dash says: "But that custard was everything!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Seeing you eat my pies makes me the happiest pony in all of Equestria!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "I know it does."
Pinkie Pie says: "You did a lot of ridiculous and overly complex things to get rid of my pies because it made you happy to see me happy."
Pinkie Pie says: "Just like I went to a lot of effort to make you the pies because it made me happy to see you happy."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yes!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And if you're willing to go through all of that, it really shows how much you're willing to do for your friends."
Rainbow Dash says: "Aw, shucks."
Rainbow Dash says: "It was nothing."
Pinkie Pie says: "Now get out of that thing and give me a hug!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Just remember."
Pinkie Pie says: "In the future, you can always be honest with me."
Applejack says: "Uh, I could've told her that."
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Cool."
Rainbow Dash says: "H-How about this?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Your hugs are too tight."
Pinkie Pie says: "No, they're not."
