Discord says: "Tea?"
Discord says: "Trendy coats?"
Discord says: "Bedrolls?"
Discord says: "Saddlebags?"
Discord says: "Oh!"
Discord says: "A surprise vacation just for the two of us?"
Discord says: "How thoughtful."
Discord says: "I hear Puerto Caballo is lovely this time of year."
Discord says: "Sand like powdered sugar."
Fluttershy says: "Um, Princess Celestia's taking us on an overnight goodwill tour of Yakyakistan."
Fluttershy says: "I just found out."
Discord says: "That's fine."
Discord says: "I wasn't thirsty anyway."
Fluttershy says: "If you're looking for something to do, you could spend the evening with Spike and Big Mac."
Discord says: "You aren't kidding."
Fluttershy says: "They're very nice."
Fluttershy says: "They have a "top secret" thing they do whenever we leave Ponyville."
Fluttershy says: "Although everypony knows about it, so it's not a very good secret."
Fluttershy says: "I think you'd have fun with them."
Discord says: "Fun?"
Discord says: "With sidekicks?"
Discord says: "Oh, you must think that we're in a dimension where everything is opposite."
Discord says: ""Da-dee-la!"
Discord says: "I'm Opposite Discord, and I want to hang out with Spike and Big Mac!"
Discord says: "I'm sure I'd have fun!"
Opposite Fluttershy says: "Well, guess what, Sassafras?!"
Opposite Fluttershy says: "!"
Opposite Fluttershy says: "I'm Opposite Fluttershy, and I'm sick of being nice and quiet all the time!"
Discord says: "Let me explain it to you as simply as I can."
Discord says: "Me?"
Discord says: "Amazing!"
Discord says: "Them?"
Discord says: "Well, I've already forgotten who we're talking about."
Discord says: "You see?"
Fluttershy says: "All I'm saying is it's an opportunity to expand your circle of friends."
Fluttershy says: "Unless you're afraid they won't like you?"
Discord says: "Oh, please."
Discord says: "Don't stoop to tedious reverse psychology."
Discord says: "You're better than that."
Fluttershy says: "It never hurts to make new friends."
Discord says: "Consider it considered."
Discord says: "Couldn't I just come with you instead?"
Discord says: "I suppose this is goodbye then."
Discord says: "Have an absolutely fabulous voyage."
Fluttershy says: "Discord..."
Discord says: "Well, it's not my fault the new train route leads into an active volcano."
Discord says: "Guess you'll have to stay."
Discord says: "Oh, you're no fun."
Applejack says: "I got my bedroll, parka, unattractive but functional hikin' boots..."
Applejack says: "Uh, anything I forgot, Pinkie Pie?"
Applejack says: "You're our resident Yakyakistan expert."
Pinkie Pie says: "Nope!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I brought yeti food!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Did I forget to mention there's a pony-eating yeti on Frost Field Glacier?"
Pinkie Pie says: "We're gonna have so much fun!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "If he messes with us, I'll turn that yeti into confetti!"
Applejack says: "Heh."
Applejack says: "Somepony's in an awful quick hurry to get us out of here."
Applejack says: "Don't y'all have too much fun without us."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I bet you boys have big plans."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Right, Spike?"
Spike says: "I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about."
Spike says: "Although if I did, I certainly wouldn't be allowed to discuss it with you girls."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Buh-bye!"
Applejack says: "Bye, y'all!"
Spike says: "Uh, I dunno what to say."
Spike says: "I mean, I hope he comes but I kinda don't want him to think of it..."
Big McIntosh says: "Yup."
Discord says: "Fascinating article, yes?"
Discord says: "Oh, salutations, my friend!"
Discord says: "Wish I could stay and chat, but I don't want to."
Spike says: "Wait!"
Spike says: "Um, we were wondering..."
Spike says: "What are you up to tonight?"
Discord says: "Oh, here we go..."
Spike says: "Do you wanna, I don't know, hang out?"
Spike says: "Is that, like, something you do?"
Discord says: "Oh, Twilight's friend and Applejack's monosyllabic brother, if only I weren't super busy this evening."
Spike says: "I guess guys' night will just be you and me."
Discord says: "A guys' night?"
Discord says: "You mean a rowdy evening of reckless revelry?"
Discord says: "Zoot suits, fedoras, swing dancing?"
Spike says: "Eh, something like that."
Spike says: "You should totally come."
Spike says: "Three of us would be way better than two..."
Discord says: "That does sound fun, actually..."
Spike says: "Too bad you're busy."
Discord says: "Well, I suppose I could squeeze you in if I move a few very important ponies around."
Discord says: "In fact, clear the whole evening."
Discord says: "Tonight is guys' night."
Discord says: "These fellas invited me to spice things up and bring a little class to the whole affair."
Discord says: "Tonight will be the best night of your lives, and not just because you get to bask in my greatness."
Spike says: "I do like basking in things."
Spike says: "See you tonight."
Spike says: "Twilight's castle."
Spike says: "The fun starts promptly at sundown."
Discord says: "Technically, the fun starts when I arrive, but I'll make sure it's around sunset."
Discord says: "Adieu, fellas."
Spike says: "And..."
Spike says: "we have sundown."
Spike says: "Repeat, we have sundown."
Spike says: "I declare tonight's guys' night ceremonies officially open!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup!"
Spike says: "It's guys' night."
Big McIntosh says: "Yup."
Spike says: "Oh, yeah."
Big McIntosh says: "Yup."
Spike says: "Havin' fun now."
Big McIntosh says: "Yup."
Spike says: "Oh, yeah!"
Big McIntosh says: "Oh, yeah!"
Spike says: "What the hay?"
Mini-Discord says: "Discord!"
Discord says: "So, shall we hop to it?"
Discord says: "I made a list of the rowdiest establishments in Ponyville."
Discord says: "It's rather short."
Spike says: "Actually, we're staying here."
Spike says: "I hope you like awesome games!"
Discord says: "Games?"
Discord says: "I love games."
Discord says: "I'm great at games."
Discord says: "Famous pony charades?"
Discord says: "Oh, this is an easy one."
Discord says: "Who am I?"
Discord says: "Huh?"
Discord says: "Huh?"
Discord says: "Oh, come on!"
Spike says: "Uh..."
Spike says: "I'm talkin' about a real game."
Discord says: "Oh, you mean like trapping best friend ponies in hedge mazes and turning them against each other."
Discord says: "Those were the days."
Celestia's mane yowls.
Spike says: "Not exactly."
Spike says: "Wait here."
Discord says: "Whatever it is, it can only get better by adding me to the mix."
Spike says: "Okay!"
Spike says: "In a world where evil reigns supreme, a small band of warriors stands tall against the darkness."
Spike says: "This is..."
Spike says: "Ogres & Oubliettes!"
Discord says: "Oh, this looks like..."
Spike says: "The best game ever?"
Spike says: "You're right!"
Discord says: "Yes..."
Spike says: "Ogres & Oubliettes is a fantasy role-playing adventure game."
Spike says: "Our goal, defeat the evil Squid Wizard, or..."
Spike says: "as we call him..."
Spike says: "the Squizard!"
Spike says: "Uh, which is like a normal name in Spiketopia, so, you know, don't think about it too much."
Discord says: "Fear not."
Discord says: "Your romantic delusions are safe with me."
Spike says: "First things first – you've gotta create a character!"
Spike says: "Name?"
Discord says: "How about..."
Discord says: "Discord?"
Spike says: "The whole point of the game is you get to use your imagination to be someone you're not."
Spike says: "I'm Garbunkle, a famous magician."
Spike says: "Everyone treats me with the utmost respect."
Discord says: "Just like in real life?"
Spike says: "And don't get jealous, but I'm a level 30 Enchanter with major skill points assigned to Intellect and Perception."
Discord says: "Go on, I'm listening."
Spike says: "Big Mac's character is Sir McBiggun, a level 27 Black Knight Unicorn from Castle Chadwick!"
Discord says: "I'm listening."
Spike says: "When his king aligned himself with the Squizard, Sir McBiggun would not besmirch his honor."
Big McIntosh says: "Nnope!"
Discord says: "I'm listening."
Spike says: "And so it came to pass, the magician and black knight vowed to rid Spiketopia of the evil Squizard."
Spike says: "So, your character's name?"
Discord says: "I already have the best name in the universe."
Discord says: "Why would I change it for something like "Captain Wuzz"?"
Spike says: "Captain Wuzz it is!"
Spike says: "What class are you, Captain Wuzz?"
Spike says: "There's Archers, Mages, Rogues..."
Discord says: "Can I suggest we take a break and, I don't know, go out and have some fun?"
Discord says: "Ponyville's not going to paint itself red."
Spike says: "You'll love it once we get started!"
Spike says: "How 'bout an Archer?"
Discord says: "Sounds just as miserable as the other options."
Discord says: "So fine."
Spike says: "Sir McBiggun, are you prepared to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Spike says: "Discord, or should I say, Captain Wuzz, are you—"
Discord says: "Oh, get on with it."
Spike says: "We find ourselves trapped in the dungeon of the evil Squizard."
Spike says: "The bars are locked tight."
Spike says: "The bars exist in our imagination."
Discord says: "Really?"
Discord says: "You describe things, and then we pretend it's real?"
Spike says: "It is real."
Spike says: "In our imagination."
Spike says: "It's your turn first."
Spike says: "What do you wanna do?"
Discord says: "Curse myself for attending this infernal evening?"
Discord says: "Ohhh, no, you mean in the game."
Spike says: "Well, you can do whatever you want."
Spike says: "Then, I roll this twenty-sided die and see if you're successful."
Discord says: "I stick my head through the bars and demand for the immediate release of the Lord of Chaos."
Spike says: "That's a big risk."
Spike says: "You have to roll a seventeen or higher to succeed."
Spike says: "Ooh, bad idea."
Spike says: "The guard gets mad."
Discord says: "This spell here."
Discord says: "I transform him into a parsnip."
Spike says: "You need eleven Intelligent points to cast a Transform Into Root Vegetable spell."
Discord says: "I'm not intelligent?"
Discord says: "I cast it anyway because this game is stupid."
Spike says: "your claws grow leaves and transform into parsnips!"
Spike says: "The guard laughs."
Spike says: "He calls his friends over, and they laugh too."
Discord says: "Don't you laugh at me, Big Mac!"
Discord says: "Does it really say that?"
Discord says: "Let me see."
Spike says: "As you get angrier, everypony laughs harder!"
Discord says: "I seal Sir McBiggun in a magic bubble until he stops laughing!"
Spike says: "I told you, you can't do magic!"
Big McIntosh says: "Whoaa!"
Big McIntosh says: "Nope!"
Big McIntosh says: "Nope!"
Big McIntosh says: "Nope!"
Discord says: ""Not intelligent enough."
Discord says: "" Please."
Spike says: "Cut it out, Discord!"
Discord says: "Oh, this game is insufferable!"
Discord says: "Let me show you a real guys' night!"
Discord says: "This is the life!"
Discord says: "Jazz, dancing, the best table magic can buy!"
Discord says: "This is what guys' night is all about."
Discord says: "Am I right, fellas?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup!"
Spike says: "I know you probably didn't do this on purpose, but this table's the perfect size and shape!"
Discord says: "I don't think so."
Discord says: "Let's have a drink."
Discord says: "Chocolate milkshakes?"
Spike says: "No, we want to go back to Ogres &—"
Discord says: "Oh, how 'bout a different game?"
Discord says: "Those are very bad cards."
Spike says: "Stop messing with us!"
Spike says: "We wanna—"
Discord says: "A dance contest?"
Discord says: "Surprise!"
Discord says: "We won!"
Spike says: "Discord!"
Discord says: "Yes?"
Spike says: "Look, we don't wanna do these things."
Spike says: "We wanna play our game."
Spike says: "If you don't want to play with us, you can, I don't know, sit and watch."
Discord says: "Sit and watch?"
Discord says: "Fine."
Discord says: "We'll play your game."
Discord says: "Are you ready to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?"
Spike says: "Sir McBiggun?!"
Spike says: "!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup!"
Spike says: "And I'm..."
Spike says: "Garbunkle?"
Spike says: "That means..."
Spike says: "Sweetness!"
Spike says: "We're in the game!"
Spike says: "Check it out!"
Spike says: "Ka-zam!"
Spike says: "It's guys' night!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup!"
Spike says: "Oh, yeah!"
Big McIntosh says: "Yup!"
Spike says: "In the game now!"
Big McIntosh says: "Yup!"
Spike says: "Oh, yeah!"
Big McIntosh says: "Oh, yeah!"
Spike says: "Discord, where are you?"
Spike says: "This is great!"
Spike says: "You made the game real!"
Discord says: "Aren't games fun?"
Spike says: "Should we be worried he's using his scary voice?"
Squizard says: "Behold!"
Squizard says: "I am the Squizard!"
Discord says: "You're welcome."
Squizard says: "Attack!"
Spike says: "Run!"
Discord says: "You get the idea."
Discord says: "Seventeen!"
Discord says: "Lucky you!"
Discord says: "Boo."
Discord says: "Boo."
Spike says: "Discord!"
Discord says: "Sir McBiggun, I'd cover the entrance if I were you."
Spike says: "This isn't funny!"
Discord says: "Isn't this what every gamer wants?"
Discord says: "To live the game?"
Discord says: "Like this?!"
Discord says: "!"
Spike says: "Ugh!"
Spike says: "This kinda hurts!"
Spike says: "Like, real pain!"
Discord says: "Oh, how kind of you to notice."
Discord says: "It's the little details that really bring alternate dimensions to life, wouldn't you say?"
Spike says: "Discord, this is awful!"
Squizard says: "Of course it is!"
Squizard says: "Spiketopia will be mine!"
Squizard says: "And Rarity shall be my bride!"
Squizard says: "I mean, Shmarity."
Spike says: "Why are you doing this?"
Spike says: "You're the worst!"
Discord says: "If I'm the worst, then why did you invite me?"
Spike says: "Because we felt bad for you!"
Discord says: "Because you..."
Discord says: "what?!"
Discord says: "!"
Spike says: "We're okay, we're okay!"
Spike says: "No thanks to you, Discord!"
Discord says: "You felt sorry for me?"
Spike says: "Who wouldn't?"
Spike says: "Fluttershy told us you practically begged her to stay!"
Spike says: "And then at the train station, you were just standing there, all alone!"
Discord says: "This can't be."
Discord says: "I'm supposed to feel sorry for you because I'm me and you're you."
Spike says: "We only invited you to be nice!"
Spike says: "I mean, you're kind of a..."
Spike says: "weirdo!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Discord says: "I ruined your night, and you don't even think I'm cool?"
Discord says: "Ugh."
Discord says: "I have a lot of other friends I need to see tonight."
Spike says: "Good!"
Discord says: "Yes, so many other friends."
Discord says: "When I say it that way, the game doesn't sound half bad."
Discord says: "Oh, well."
Spike says: "It..."
Spike says: "it's better this way, right?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Spike says: "Because..."
Spike says: "now he can't bother us, 'cause he's off somewhere by himself..."
Spike says: "all alone..."
Spike says: "with no friends."
Big McIntosh says: "Yup."
Spike says: "Captain Wuzz?"
Spike says: "Can you hear me?"
Discord says: "Oh!"
Discord says: "You realized how amazing I am and that I make you cooler just by being around me?"
Discord says: "Uh..."
Discord says: "No, no, actually, that's not what I meant to say..."
Discord says: "I'm..."
Discord says: "sssssss..."
Spike says: "What?"
Discord says: "I'm ssssssss—"
Spike says: "Can't hear you."
Big McIntosh says: "Nope."
Discord says: "I'm trying to say I'm sorry, all right?!"
Discord says: "!"
Discord says: "I'm sorry for ruining your game, and I'm sorry that I thought I was better than you!"
Discord says: "Now let's play before this evening gets any sappier, shall we?"
Spike says: "Huh?"
Spike says: "Yeah, yeah!"
Spike says: "Okay!"
Spike says: "What if we forgot the board and the pieces for a minute?"
Spike says: "I mean, the whole game coming to life was completely terrifying, but also kind of the best thing ever!"
Spike says: "So, uh, Big Mac and I were wondering..."
Spike says: "What if you toned it down just a teensy bit?"
Mane Six says: "Huh?"
Spike says: "I've got your back, Captain Wuzz!"
Big McIntosh says: "Wha-hah!"
Discord says: "Garbunkle!"
Discord says: "Follow my lead!"
Spike says: "Bull's-eye!"
Discord says: "Nice one!"
Spike says: "It's guys' night!"
Discord says: "It's guys' night!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup!"
Spike says: "Oh, yeah!"
Discord says: "Oh, yeah!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup!"
Spike says: "Having fun now!"
Discord says: "Having fun now!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup!"
Spike says: "Oh, yeah!"
Discord says: "Oh, yeah!"
Big McIntosh says: "Oh, yeah!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We should just close the door and let them finish..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "whatever this..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "is."
Rainbow Dash says: "No way!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Did you see Big Mac's sword?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I totally want in!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I don't know what it is, but it looks like super duper fun!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Guys' night!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Guys' night!"
