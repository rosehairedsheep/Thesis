Twilight Sparkle says: "I hope Shining Armor and Princess Cadance don't think it's too soon for me to come back to the Crystal Empire for a visit."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But I just know Flurry Heart's grown so much already."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I wonder if I'll even recognize her."
Starlight Glimmer says: "She's the only baby they have, Twilight."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I think it'll be pretty easy to figure out who she is."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Sorry."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I know you want to visit your niece as much as possible, and I'm excited to see Sunburst again."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I just don't wanna fall behind on my friendship lessons back home."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Starlight, your work in Ponyville isn't going anywhere."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Besides, I think we all know you can learn about friendship anywhere."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Right, Spike?"
Spike says: ""Spike?"
Spike says: "" Who's "Spike"?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Pfft."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Uh, you're Spike, Spike."
Starlight Glimmer says: "And why are you dressed like that?"
Spike says: "Guys, you're blowing my cover!"
Spike says: "How'd you even know it was me?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Because you're you..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "in a coat, hat and glasses."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Also, we're the only ones here."
Spike says: "Right."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, why do you need a disguise?"
Spike says: "Last time we came to the Crystal Empire, there was a lot goin' on with the new baby and the Crystalling, but I still got mobbed in the street."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I wouldn't say mobbed."
Spike says: "And this is just a family visit."
Spike says: "I wouldn't want the presence of Spike the Brave and Glorious to turn it into some kind of circus."
Starlight Glimmer says: "We get it."
Starlight Glimmer says: "The Crystal Ponies adore you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "He did save the Empire."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Twice."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But still, I don't think your presence will turn our visit into a circus."
Spike says: "Not if I find the right disguise, it won't."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Uh, disguise or not, Spike, I don't think you need to worry about being mobbed."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Nopony's here."
Spike says: "It's like a ghost town."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've got a bad feeling about this."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Yeah, this is weird."
Spike says: "I guess I don't need the disguise after all."
Crystal Ponies cheering.
Honeysparkle says: "It's Spike the Brave and Glorious!"
Sapphire Joy says: "He's come to save us yet again!"
Crystal Ponies says: "Spike!"
Crystal Ponies says: "Spike!"
Crystal Ponies says: "Spike!"
Crystal Ponies says: "Spike!"
Spike says: "Save you from what?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Yeah, what's going on?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why was everypony hiding?"
"Amber Laurel" says: "Oh, it sure looks like Princess Twilight and her pupil."
"Scarlet Heart" says: "But how can we be sure?"
"Golden Väs" says: "We can't!"
"Golden Väs" says: "Either one of them could be the..."
"Golden Väs" says: "you know!"
"Amber Laurel" says: "the real Spike?!"
"Amber Laurel" says: "!"
"Scarlet Heart" says: "Everypony, run!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Something strange is definitely going on."
Spike says: "Ya think?"
Royal guard 1 says: "Who goes there?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Um, you don't recognize the Princess of Friendship?"
Royal guard 1 says: "Of course we recognize her."
Royal guard 2 says: "But that doesn't mean it's really her."
Spike says: "It's okay, guys."
Spike says: "They're with me."
Spike says: "And any friend of Spike the Brave and Glorious is a friend of the Crystal Empire, am I right?"
Royal guard 2 says: "Huh."
Royal guard 2 says: "It does look like him."
Royal guard 1 says: "Well, it would, wouldn't it?"
Royal guard 1 says: "I'm sorry, but we'll need to see some proof of identification."
Princess Cadance says: "We'll take care of things from here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Cadance, thank goodness!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's going on?"
Shining Armor says: "We can explain, Twily..."
Shining Armor says: "if it really is you."
Princess Cadance says: "Sunshine, sunshine..."
Princess Cadance says: "..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "..."
Princess Cadance says: "ladybugs awake!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "ladybugs awake!"
Princess Cadance says: "Clap your hooves and do a little shake!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Clap your hooves and do a little shake!"
Princess Cadance says: "Mmm!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Mmm!"
Shining Armor says: "It's okay, everypony."
Shining Armor says: "It's her."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Of course it's her!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "What's all this about?"
Sunburst says: "A changeling's been spotted nearby."
Twilight Sparkle says: "A changeling?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Spike says: "That's not good."
Princess Cadance says: "No, it's not."
Princess Cadance says: "After Queen Chrysalis took my place at our wedding and invaded Canterlot with her army of minions, we're not taking any chances."
Sunburst says: "Changelings feed off of love."
Sunburst says: "And ever since Flurry Heart's Crystalling, the Empire is filled with more love than anywhere in Equestria."
Sunburst says: "It's possible they've come for the baby."
Shining Armor says: "That's why we posted the extra guards, and why we're—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Checking everypony's identity."
Princess Cadance says: "I'm sorry for all of this."
Princess Cadance says: "Flurry Heart's really been looking forward to seeing you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, she's gotten so big!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Starlight and I will do whatever we can to help protect her."
Princess Cadance says: "To be honest, having you here is already a big relief."
Shining Armor says: "Hmm."
Shining Armor says: "The royal guards were wondering if Spike the Brave and Glorious would like to join in the search for the changeling."
Spike says: "Really?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh, I don't know if that's such a good idea, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It sounds dangerous."
Spike says: "Come on, Twilight, this is Spike the Brave and Glorious you're talking to."
Spike says: "Have you ever known me to run from danger?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Um..."
Shining Armor says: "He'll be safe with our guards."
Spike says: "Or will your guards be safe with me?"
Royal guard 1 says: "Spike the Brave and Glorious, you've faced the evil changelings before."
Royal guard 1 says: "What can you tell us?"
Spike says: "Oh, uh, well, they are changelings, so they can..."
Spike says: "change."
Royal guard 1 says: "You hear that?"
Royal guard 1 says: "These monsters can look like any of us, so be on guard, guards!"
Royal guard 1 says: "Even more than normal."
Spike says: "And they could be anywhere."
Spike says: "So we should cover as much ground as possible."
Spike says: "You, search that way!"
Spike says: "And you, search that way!"
Spike says: "And..."
Spike says: "I'll..."
Spike says: "just search..."
Spike says: "here, I guess."
Spike says: "Not many places to hide."
Spike says: "Unless that rock is a changeling."
Spike says: "Okay, rock."
Spike says: "How do I know you're really a rock?"
Spike says: "Hmm."
Spike says: "Not talkin', huh?"
Spike says: "Well, you can't fool me!"
Spike says: "Uhh!"
Spike says: "Ow!"
Spike says: "Help!"
Spike says: "Help!"
Spike says: "Help!"
Spike says: "Help!"
Spike says: "Help!"
Spike says: "Help!"
Spike says: "Help!"
Spike says: "Oh!"
Spike says: "Uhh!"
Spike says: "Phew!"
Spike says: "Just my reflection."
Spike says: "Huh?"
Spike says: "Ha!"
Spike says: "Ha-ha!"
Spike says: "Hmm."
Spike says: "Just my imagination, I guess."
Spike says: "Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-changeling!"
Thorax says: "No, wait!"
Thorax says: "Come back!"
Spike says: "This is unexpected."
Thorax says: "The ice is pretty slippery."
Thorax says: "I wouldn't want you to get hurt because of me."
Spike says: "You..."
Spike says: "saved me?"
Thorax says: "It's okay."
Thorax says: "I know you don't wanna be friends."
Spike says: "Wait!"
Spike says: "I don't understand."
Spike says: "Changelings are supposed to be evil..."
Spike says: "right?"
Thorax says: "Evil?"
Thorax says: "Oh, not me."
Thorax says: "All I've ever wanted is a friend."
Thorax says: "From the moment I first split my egg in the nursery hive..."
Thorax says: "I was part of the attack on Canterlot during the royal wedding, but I'd never seen true friendship like that!"
Thorax says: "And I couldn't just steal it and feed on its love."
Thorax says: "I wanted to share it!"
Thorax says: "After that, I knew I couldn't live with my kind anymore."
Thorax says: "I set off looking for love to share, but..."
Spike says: "But..."
Spike says: "what?"
Thorax says: "I'm starving!"
Thorax says: "And there's so much love in the Crystal Empire right now."
Thorax says: "It's what drew me here!"
Thorax says: "But it's drivin' me crazy!"
Spike says: "That would be from the royal Crystalling."
Spike says: "It's pretty much a giant outpouring of light and love for a new baby."
Thorax says: "Oh, sorry!"
Thorax says: "I'm just so hungry!"
Thorax says: "If I had a friend, maybe the love we shared could sustain me, but I don't think the Crystal Ponies want to be friends."
Spike says: "What if I told you there was somepony they respect and admire so much, he could convince them to give it a try?"
Thorax says: "If only that were true."
Spike says: "It is!"
Spike says: "I mean, I am!"
Spike says: "It's me, Spike!"
Spike says: "Spike the Brave and Glorious?"
Spike says: "I'm sure you've heard of me."
Thorax says: "Nope."
Thorax says: "But I was raised by an evil queen."
Thorax says: "I'm Thorax."
Thorax says: "I can't believe you want to help me."
Spike says: "Why?"
Spike says: "Hasn't anypony ever just been nice to you?"
Thorax says: "Uh!"
Thorax says: "S-Sorry!"
Thorax says: "Kindness like that kind of brings it out."
Thorax says: "Do you still wanna be my friend?"
Spike says: "Of course!"
Spike says: "And I am one hundred percent sure I can get the whole Crystal Empire to be your friend too."
Spike says: "But..."
Spike says: "maybe I should just, uh, talk to them first."
Royal guard 1 says: "What do you mean?"
Royal guard 1 says: "Did you see the changeling?"
Royal guard 2 says: "Did you defeat the evil creature?"
Spike says: "Defeating a changeling would be brave, but do you know what would be glorious?"
Royal guard 1 says: "Defeating two changelings?"
Royal guard 2 says: "Defeating all the changelings?"
Spike says: "Not having to fight the changeling at all!"
Spike says: "Because I made friends with him."
Royal guard 1 says: "Oh, wow!"
Royal guard 1 says: "For a second I thought you were serious!"
Royal guard 2 says: "Could you imagine?"
Royal guard 2 says: "Friends with a changeling?"
Spike says: "I am serious."
Spike says: "He wants to be friends!"
Royal guard 2 says: "Right!"
Royal guard 1 says: "Not only are you Spike the Brave and Glorious, you're also Spike the Hilarious!"
Spike says: "I'm not joking!"
Spike says: "The changeling is nice!"
Shining Armor says: "I'm sorry, but I don't think it's funny."
Shining Armor says: "The Changeling Queen Chrysalis kidnapped Cadance and cast a spell on me."
Shining Armor says: "There's no such thing as a nice changeling."
Spike says: "You're right, Shining Armor."
Spike says: "Sorry."
Spike says: "That was a..."
Spike says: "bad joke."
Thorax says: "So?"
Thorax says: "So?"
Thorax says: "Uh, what did they say?"
Thorax says: "How many new friends do I have?"
Spike says: "Well, it didn't go exactly the way I thought."
Spike says: "I think I might know!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, if you're done searching for the changeling, Starlight and I could use your help."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We're working on a protection spell for Flurry Heart, and nopony takes notes like you."
Spike says: "Uh, actually, Twilight, I, uh, wanted to introduce you to my friend, uh..."
Spike says: "Uh, Crystal, uh..."
Spike says: "Hoof!"
Spike says: "Crystal Hoof!"
Spike says: "My good friend, Crystal Hoof."
Thorax says: "Nice to meet you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, it's, uh, nice to meet you, too."
Twilight Sparkle says: "How do you know Spike?"
Thorax says: "Oh, uh, Spike and I go way back."
Spike says: "To the Equestria Games!"
Spike says: "That's when we met."
Spike says: "We've been pen pals ever since."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pen pals?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You could have been using my pen pal quill set!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why didn't you tell me?"
Spike says: "Well, I..."
Spike says: "I pretty much only write to him when you and Starlight are..."
Spike says: "studying."
Thorax says: "I like to brag to all my friends about my letters from Spike the Brave and Glorious."
Spike says: "Yeah."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, I'm sure Starlight and I can manage, if you want to spend time with your friend."
Spike says: "Great!"
Spike says: "Crystal Hoof promised to take me around the city."
Thorax says: "Oh, that was amazing!"
Spike says: "I told ya."
Royal guard 1 says: "Crystal Hoof is nearly as entertaining as Spike himself."
Thorax says: "But I can't keep pretending to be a Crystal Pony forever, can I?"
Spike says: "Relax."
Spike says: "You're winning them over."
Spike says: "Pretty soon, nopony will care that you're a changeling."
Princess Cadance says: "Spike!"
Princess Cadance says: "Twilight told me you were off with a friend."
Princess Cadance says: "And any friend of Spike the Brave and Glorious is a friend of mine."
Thorax says: "Oh, she's so beautiful!"
Thorax says: "There's so much l-love around her..."
Thorax says: "!"
Thorax says: "I..."
Thorax says: "I..."
Thorax says: "!"
Thorax says: "I..."
Thorax says: "..."
Thorax says: "stop!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Get away from the changeling!"
Spike says: "Wait, no!"
Spike says: "You don't understand!"
Sunburst says: "This changeling replaced your friend to get close to the baby!"
Sunburst says: "What other explanation could there be?!"
Sunburst says: "!"
Spike says: "I..."
Spike says: "..."
Spike says: "I don't know."
Royal guard 1 says: "After it!"
Royal guard 1 says: "Don't let the changeling escape!"
Princess Cadance says: "I hope your friend is okay."
Spike says: "Yeah..."
Spike says: "Me, too."
Royal guard 1 says: "Spike, you should go find Crystal Hoof while we hunt down the changeling."
Spike says: "I'm pretty sure he doesn't wanna see me."
Shining Armor says: "Spread out!"
Shining Armor says: "The changeling is probably still nearby!"
Spike says: "Actually, I'm pretty sure he ran as far away from here as possible..."
Spike says: "."
Spike says: "But I bet I know where!"
Spike says: "Thorax!"
Spike says: "Hello?"
Spike says: "I just want to apologize!"
Spike says: "I should have stood up for you..."
Spike says: "Aw, come on, Thorax!"
Spike says: "I know you're in here!"
Thorax says: "Leave me alone!"
Spike says: "Little help?"
Thorax says: "Why do you think I would help you?"
Thorax says: "I'm an "evil changeling"!"
Spike says: "Because you're my friend."
Spike says: "I just wish I had been one to you."
Thorax says: "It's okay, I know it's hard."
Thorax says: "Everyone in the Crystal Empire loves you."
Thorax says: "I couldn't ask you to give that up for me."
Spike says: "You don't have to ask."
Thorax says: "What are you gonna do?"
Spike says: "What I should've done in the first place."
Royal guards says: "Let's move!"
Royal guards says: "Move!"
Royal guards says: "Move!"
Royal guards says: "This way!"
Royal guards says: "This way!"
Royal guards says: "Let's go!"
Royal guards says: "Check there?"
Royal guards says: "Okay."
Royal guards says: "Over here!"
Royal guards says: "Over here!"
Royal guard says: "Look around that corner!"
Royal guard says: "Over there!"
Royal guard says: "Over there!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I know it's bad that there's a changeling around, but is all this really necessary?"
Princess Cadance says: "If there's one changeling, there may well be a whole army on the way."
Twilight Sparkle says: "True."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But Starlight has a point."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is getting a little out of hand."
Princess Cadance says: "I understand, but I don't know what else we can do."
Spike says: "I do!"
Shining Armor says: "Spike!"
Shining Armor says: "What are you doing?!"
Shining Armor says: "!"
Shining Armor says: "Get away from that thing!"
Spike says: "No."
Spike says: "He's not a "thing"!"
Spike says: "His name is Thorax, and he's my friend!"
Spike.
Would you say I'm a hero.
Glorious and brave.
If I told you something you wouldn't believe?
That sometimes I'm scared.
And I can make mistakes.
And I'm not so heroic, it seems.
But if day can turn to night.
And the darkness turn to light.
Then why can't we imagine a changeling can change?
No two ponies are exactly the same.
No two snowflakes ever match their design.
And I thought I was strong.
But I was nothing but wrong.
When I forgot to be friendly and kind.
But if day can turn to night.
And the darkness turn to light.
Then why can't we imagine a changeling can change?
Would you say I'm a hero.
Glorious and brave.
If I told you something you wouldn't believe?
This changeling, it seems.
Knows the real me.
And would stay by my side 'til the end.
So if day can turn to night.
And the darkness turn to light.
Then why can't we imagine.
Just why can't we imagine.
Then why can't we imagine a changeling can change?
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, I'm so proud of you."
Spike says: "You are?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Of course!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're a celebrity here in the Crystal Empire, and you just risked all of it for a friend!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can't imagine anything more brave than that."
Twilight Sparkle says: "As the Princess of Friendship, I try to set an example for all of Equestria."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But today, it was Spike who taught me that a new friend can come from anywhere."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I guess everypony still has things to learn about friendship."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Even me!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And if Spike says Thorax is his friend, then he's my friend too."
Thorax says: "Thank you."
Princess Cadance says: "On behalf of the Crystal Empire, I would like to extend my hoof in friendship, and I'm sure all of my subjects are eager to do the same."
Shining Armor says: "Welcome to the Crystal Empire, Thorax."
Shining Armor says: "I'm sorry we didn't take the time to get to know you."
Shining Armor says: "Maybe we can change that now."
Thorax says: "That'd be so amazing!"
Thorax says: "I want to know all about friendship, and maybe one day I can take that knowledge back to the Changeling Kingdom!"
Thorax says: "If my kind learned how to create love for one another, maybe they wouldn't have to take it from others!"
Royal guard 1 says: "To Spike the Brave and Glorious!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Looks like you were right after all."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Right about what?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Friendship lessons can happen anywhere."
