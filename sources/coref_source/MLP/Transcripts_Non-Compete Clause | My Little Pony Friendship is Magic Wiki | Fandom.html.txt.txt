Yona says: "Huh?"
Silverstream says: "Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Did I miss the Teacher of the Month announcement?"
Applejack says: "You're just in time."
Applejack says: "But it's gonna be me."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, right."
Rainbow Dash says: "I got this one nailed."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And the Friendship School Teacher of the Month is..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fluttershy!"
Applejack says: "Again?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, my!"
Fluttershy says: "I don't know how I keep winning."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah."
Rainbow Dash says: "Me, neither."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The award is based on the students' vote."
Twilight Sparkle says: "They must really like you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Congratulations, Fluttershy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Next item of business – I've been looking into a new activity for our friendship classes."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Section one-forty-seven, paragraph two states that teamwork is a key part of friendship."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And section two-two-nine, paragraph nine says outdoor activity reinforces learning."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Add that together, and what do you get?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh, ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay, let me see."
Pinkie Pie says: "One-forty-seven, two-twenty-nine, carry the two..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Three hundred and eighty-seven?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Mm-mm."
Twilight Sparkle says: "A teamwork field trip."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Leading it is a Teacher of the Month-type job, so I thought I'd ask—"
Applejack says: "I'm your pony, Twilight!"
Applejack says: "Sweet Apple Acres has taught me a thing or two about workin' together."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, but being a Wonderbolt's the definition of teamwork."
Applejack says: "I'm sure you're not sayin' fancy flyin' makes ya a better choice than me."
Rainbow Dash says: "I wouldn't say "better"."
Rainbow Dash says: "Just a little more qualified."
Rainbow Dash says: "No offense."
Fluttershy says: "Maybe you can lead the field trip together."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Of course!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Who better to model the importance of working as a team?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Um, Rarity?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Fluttershy?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Me?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Spike?"
Pinkie Pie says: "This flowerpot?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Both of you are teamwork experts."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If the students see the two of you teaching together, they'll learn even more."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know you've been competitive in the past, but I'm sure you'd never let that get in the way of friendship education."
Applejack says: "Of course!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Totally!"
Ocellus says: "I've never been on a field trip before."
Smolder says: "Yeah, what's the point of this exactly?"
Gallus says: "Getting out of the classroom."
Gallus says: "Duh."
Yona says: "Yak best at field-tripping!"
Silverstream says: "That's what we're doing?!"
Silverstream says: "!"
Silverstream says: "So fun!"
Sandbar says: "Pretty sure the headmare has something else in mind."
Twilight Sparkle says: "All right, class."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Today you'll learn how important working together is for building a strong friendship."
Applejack says: "Hey, y'all!"
Applejack says: "Ready to get out there and do some learnin' the Apple family way?"
Rainbow Dash says: "This is basically gonna be the best field trip in the history of ever!"
Rainbow Dash says: "With me in charge, that is."
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa!"
Applejack says: "With us in charge."
Applejack says: "Meanin' mostly me."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah."
Rainbow Dash says: "Good one."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And what teamwork activity do you two have planned for today?"
Shed buildin'!
Canoe racing!
Silverstream says: "No..."
Silverstream says: "way."
Silverstream says: "We get to do both?!"
Silverstream says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I bet that's exactly what your teachers had in mind."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why don't you start with shed building first?"
Applejack says: "Heh."
Applejack says: "Don't mind if I do!"
Applejack says: "Everycreature, follow the leader!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll check in later to see how it's going."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Remember to work together!"
Applejack says: "Now take a good, deep breath."
Applejack says: "What do you smell?"
Gallus says: "Uh, yak?"
Yona says: "Mm-hmm!"
Applejack says: "Nope."
Applejack says: "Try again."
Ocellus says: "Um, apples?"
Applejack says: "And..."
Applejack says: "?"
Applejack says: "Anyone?"
Applejack says: "Anyone?"
Applejack says: "No?"
Applejack says: "The promise of..."
Applejack says: "teamwork!"
Applejack says: "That there's an apple shed."
Applejack says: "And this here is what we're gonna use to build it."
Applejack says: "Nothin' brings friends together like a little hard work and honest sweat."
Rainbow Dash says: "Sweat?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Seriously?"
Rainbow Dash says: "That's supposed to be part of friendship?"
Applejack says: "Not everypony would know that, Rainbow Dash."
Applejack says: "Just "Teacher of the Month" kind o' ponies."
Rainbow Dash says: "Whatever."
Rainbow Dash says: "Let's just get this done so we can move on to my activity."
Applejack says: "That's it!"
Applejack says: "Measure twice and cut once!"
Applejack says: "Haste makes waste!"
Applejack says: "Slow and steady!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Emphasis on the slow."
Applejack says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Applejack says: "Ya can't build an apple shed like that!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, yeah?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I just did!"
Sandbar says: "Whoa!"
Sandbar says: "No way!"
Rest of Young Six says: "Whoa!"
Gallus says: "Impressive..."
Gallus says: "if you can call an apple shed impressive."
Applejack says: "Just 'cause it's fast don't mean it's good!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, sorry, can't hear you."
Rainbow Dash says: "Too busy practicing my "Teacher of the Month" pose."
Applejack says: "Don't count your pictures before they're snapped, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, come on!"
Rainbow Dash says: "These students are totally gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done!"
Applejack says: "No!"
Applejack says: "They're gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done right!"
Smolder says: "Yeah..."
Smolder says: "This isn't awkward at all..."
Applejack says: "Steady..."
Applejack says: "Steady..."
Applejack says: "Take 'er nice and slow..."
Applejack says: "Little to the left..."
Applejack says: "Uh, a hair to the right..."
Applejack says: "Now, a hoof shavin' higher..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Just bring it down already!"
Applejack says: "I'll give ya one guess whose side is still standin'."
Yona says: "Yak side!"
Yona says: "Uh..."
Ocellus says: "Um, professors?"
Ocellus says: "I'm a little confused about teamwork now."
Rainbow Dash says: "That's because you need a different teacher."
Rainbow Dash says: "Follow me!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Last one to the stream is a rotten apple shed!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Who's ready to smash the all-time Equestria speed record for river canoeing?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Gallus says: "Is that even a thing?"
Sandbar says: "First I've heard of it."
Rainbow Dash says: "We need to get to the finish line before this alarm goes off."
Rainbow Dash says: "That means you gotta move fast!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Any questions?"
Yona says: "Uh, Yona has questions."
Rainbow Dash says: "No time for 'em!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Get in the boat!"
Applejack says: "You really think winnin' some canoein' record is gonna get you that Teacher of the Month trophy?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm pretty sure everycreature's gonna like it a lot better than pounding nails and cutting wood."
Yona says: "Yak not like water."
Ocellus says: "Sometimes, when I'm scared to try something new, I whistle."
Gallus says: "We got you, Yona."
Applejack says: "Way I see it, Twilight's gonna give that teachin' trophy to a teacher, not a racer."
Rainbow Dash says: "We'll see about that."
Rainbow Dash says: "Stroke!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Stroke!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Stroke!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Harder!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Put your backs into it, newbies!"
Applejack says: "Stroooooke..."
Applejack says: "Stroooooke..."
Applejack says: "Stroooooke..."
Applejack says: "Slower..."
Applejack says: "Focus on your paddle technique, y'all."
Silverstream says: "Woo-hoo!"
Silverstream says: "We're really going now!"
Smolder says: "So..."
Smolder says: "when do we get to the part when we move?"
Rainbow Dash says: "When everycreature starts listening to me, the leader of my activity, Applejack!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Now stroke!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Dig in, team!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We can still beat that record!"
Applejack says: "Stop!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Go!"
Ocellus says: "Which way do we go?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Left!"
Applejack says: "Right!"
Silverstream says: "Aye-aye, captains!"
Silverstream says: "Wait, what?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Left!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I can see the finish line from here!"
Applejack says: "If we go left, we'll be headin' straight into the bite-acuda fish!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Who cares about a few fish?"
Sandbar says: "Uh, professors?"
Applejack says: "You'll care plenty when they bite ya!"
Sandbar says: "Guys?"
Rainbow Dash says: "We'll just go around them!"
Sandbar says: "Rock!"
Silverstream says: "I love field trips!"
Applejack says: "I hope you're happy."
Rainbow Dash says: "Obviously not!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Because there goes our new speed record!"
Yona says: "Help!"
Yona says: "Yak not swim!"
Ocellus says: "That's okay!"
Ocellus says: "Your friends can change into creatures that do!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "How's the canoeing..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "going?"
Smolder says: "About as good as the apple shed building."
Rainbow Dash says: "I totally had things under control until Applejack messed 'em up!"
Applejack says: "I did not!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Did too!"
Applejack says: "Did not!"
Gallus says: "Yup."
Gallus says: "It's been like this all day."
Sandbar says: "I wouldn't say all day."
Sandbar says: "Just..."
Sandbar says: "ninety-nine percent of it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can't believe this!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're not teaching teamwork!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're competing with each other!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I thought you were past that!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We are!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Mostly."
Applejack says: "We got carried away with wantin' to be the Teacher of the Month is all."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The Teacher of the Month wouldn't care about being the Teacher of the Month!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know Fluttershy would be thrilled to see another pony win."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm taking over this field trip!"
Applejack says: "H-Hold up, Twilight."
Applejack says: "Don't count Rainbow Dash for the award just yet."
Applejack says: "You shoulda seen her fire up those students to build a shed."
Rainbow Dash says: "No way!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You're the one the students listen to."
Rainbow Dash says: "Besides, you saved us from those pony-eating fish."
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, long story."
Rainbow Dash says: "But Applejack should definitely be Teacher of the Month."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hmmm..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Maybe you two have learned something, after all."
Applejack says: "Does that mean you'll give us another chance at the Teacher of the—"
Rainbow Dash says: "Field trip?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on, Twilight."
Rainbow Dash says: "We get it."
Rainbow Dash says: "No more arguing."
Rainbow Dash says: "Right, Applejack?"
Applejack says: "Right as rain and twice as fresh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fine."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But I'm picking the next activity you two lead."
Twilight Sparkle says: "A nature walk."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nopony could possibly argue over that."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Right?"
Applejack says: "Right!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Right!"
Applejack says: "See?"
Applejack says: "We're agreein' already."
Applejack says: "Well, look at that."
Applejack says: "The path splits up ahead."
Applejack says: "Left or right?"
Smolder says: "Ugh."
Smolder says: "Here we go again."
Applejack says: "Where to, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I was thinking right..."
Rainbow Dash says: "unless you want to go left."
Rainbow Dash says: "Because what makes you happy makes me happy."
Applejack says: "Aw, heck."
Applejack says: "Forget about me."
Applejack says: "You want to go right, we'll go right."
Rainbow Dash says: "But teamwork means listening to other ponies, so it's up to you."
Applejack says: "Well, aren't you as sweet as sugar apple pie?"
Applejack says: "But it's up to you."
Yona says: "Ugh!"
Yona says: "Follow me!"
Yona says: "Yak know best way!"
Applejack says: "Hey!"
Applejack says: "Where are y'all goin'?"
Ocellus says: "I think we've gone in the same circle five times."
Sandbar says: "Only because someponies won't make up their minds about which way to go."
Rainbow Dash says: "Do you want to keep going in a circle, Applejack?"
Applejack says: "Up to you, Rainbow Dash."
Applejack says: "I insist."
Rainbow Dash says: "No, no."
Rainbow Dash says: "I insist."
Applejack says: "Heh."
Applejack says: "But I insisted first."
Silverstream says: "Are we still on a field trip?"
Silverstream says: "'Cause this just feels like being lost."
Smolder says: "Ugh."
Smolder says: "We can still get back to school before dark if we cross that ravine and stop doubling back."
Rainbow Dash says: "We knew that."
Rainbow Dash says: "All part of our plan."
Rainbow Dash says: "Right, Applejack?"
Applejack says: "Uh, yup!"
Applejack says: "All we have to do is, uh..."
Applejack says: "build a bridge 'cross that, uh, giant canyon, and we're home free."
Applejack says: "That is, if-if you think a bridge is a good idea."
Rainbow Dash says: "Only if you want to build a bridge."
Gallus says: "Stop!"
Gallus says: "Listen."
Gallus says: "We can just fly everyone over and be done."
Applejack says: "Nope!"
Applejack says: "There's still plenty o' time to teach y'all a lesson in teamwork."
Rainbow Dash says: "Cooperation!"
Applejack says: "Togetherness!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You are so right!"
Applejack says: "Only as right as you are!"
Smolder says: "Okay!"
Smolder says: "We'll build a bridge!"
Smolder says: "What do we use?"
Branches!
Vines!
Vines!
Branches!
Applejack says: "I'm goin' with your idea!"
Applejack says: "Vines!"
Applejack says: "No buts about it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I-I'm building with your idea!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Branches!"
Rainbow Dash says: "End of story!"
Applejack says: "Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Why didn't I think of branches to begin with?"
Rainbow Dash says: "They're so—"
Rainbow Dash says: "..."
Rainbow Dash says: "easy to work with."
Applejack says: "These here vines are just the thing, Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Not to disagree, but these here branches are the way to—"
Applejack says: "Help!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Help!"
Ocellus says: "Uh, at least now they're agreeing on something."
Rainbow Dash says: "I can't get out!"
Applejack says: "Let me try."
Rainbow Dash says: "Let me guess."
Rainbow Dash says: "Bite-acudas?"
Applejack says: "Mm-hmm."
Applejack says: "And they look mighty hungry."
Sandbar says: "We gotta get our professors out of there!"
Sandbar says: "Anycreature have a plan?"
Gallus says: "Leave 'em hangin'?"
Silverstream says: "What?!"
Silverstream says: "!"
Gallus says: "I'm kidding!"
Gallus says: "..."
Gallus says: "Kinda."
Ocellus says: "We need to work fast!"
Ocellus says: "And together!"
Smolder says: "But mainly fast."
Applejack says: "I hate to admit it, but—"
Applejack says: "..."
Applejack says: "this whole mess is kinda our fault."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah."
Rainbow Dash says: "No trophy is worth getting eaten over."
Applejack says: "So what do ya say?"
Applejack says: "You want to team up and get ourselves out of this here pickle barrel?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I thought you'd never ask."
Ocellus says: "Aah!"
Ocellus says: "Don't worry."
Ocellus says: "I'm just the distraction."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ocellus?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Applejack says: "You nearly scared the cutie marks off us!"
Silverstream says: "Need a lift?"
Yona says: "Yak smash!"
Sandbar says: "Welcome back, professors!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Now, that was a rescue!"
Applejack says: "And y'all did it together!"
Gallus says: "No big."
Gallus says: "Those fish weren't even a thing."
Ocellus says: "Oops."
Ocellus says: "Sorry."
Silverstream says: "Best..."
Silverstream says: "field trip..."
Silverstream says: "ever!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "How was the field trip?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What did you all learn?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uhhhh..."
Applejack says: "Uhhhh..."
Yona says: "Yak learn ponies smart!"
Silverstream says: "Yeah!"
Silverstream says: "Professors Applejack and Rainbow Dash were such good teachers!"
Gallus says: "It was kind of crazy genius."
Gallus says: "They showed us what not to do so we'd figure out what we should do."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Really..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "?"
Sandbar says: "It took us a while to get it."
Smolder says: "Especially at the ravine."
Smolder says: "It would've been so much easier to just fly home."
Silverstream says: "But instead, our professors built bridges the wrong way just to show us how important teamwork is."
Gallus says: "Yeah."
Gallus says: "That was super dangerous."
Gallus says: "Talk about commitment."
Ocellus says: "We know it's too early to pick the Teacher of the Month."
Ocellus says: "But we'd like you to consider Rainbow Dash and Applejack."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Thank you for telling me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm so glad to hear your field trip was a success."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll make sure to schedule another one right away."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You were actually just competing the entire time, weren't you?"
Applejack says: "To tell you the truth..."
Applejack says: "yeah."
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, not all the time."
Rainbow Dash says: "I agreed with you for the whole nature walk."
Applejack says: "Only 'cause you were anglin' for that Teacher of the Month award!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You were the one doing the "angling"!"
Applejack says: "You were more like fandanglin'!"
What does that even mean?! No one here can understand your country bumpkin talk...!
Look, we all live in the same town here...!
