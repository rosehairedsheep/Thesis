Scootaloo says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Nice moves, kid."
Scootaloo says: "Nice moves?"
Scootaloo says: "..."
Scootaloo says: "nice moves!"
Scootaloo says: "..."
Scootaloo says: "Then, all of a sudden, I'm airborne!"
Scootaloo says: "And Rainbow Dash looks over and was like, "Nice moves, kid."
Apple Bloom says: "Woooow."
Sweetie Belle says: "She really said that?"
Scootaloo says: "I mean, it's like she practically told me she wanted to take me under her wing, teach me everything she knows, and become like my big sister!"
Apple Bloom says: "I dunno about all that."
Sweetie Belle says: "It was a really nice compliment and all, but..."
Scootaloo says: "I know, I know."
Scootaloo says: "But all that stuff I said could happen, right?"
Apple Bloom says: "Sure."
Sweetie Belle says: "Absolutely."
Scootaloo says: "I just need to find a way to spend some time with her, y'know, so she can see more of my awesomeness."
Apple Bloom says: "Well..."
Apple Bloom says: "Applejack and I are supposed to be campin' up at Winsome Falls this weekend."
Apple Bloom says: "Maybe I could get my big sis to invite Rainbow Dash, and then you could come, too!"
Scootaloo says: "Really?!"
Scootaloo says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "Sure!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I wanna go..."
Apple Bloom says: "Well, duh, of course you can go!"
Sweetie Belle says: "And I'll get Rarity to come too!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Rarity loves camping!"
Rarity says: "I despise camping!"
Rarity says: "All of that..."
Rarity says: "..."
Rarity says: "nature."
Sweetie Belle says: "Applejack's going with her little sister."
Sweetie Belle says: "But, y'know, if you don't wanna spend time with me..."
Rarity says: "Oh, all right!"
Rarity says: "Ooh!"
Rarity says: "Of course I will need to find an outfit more appropriate for 'roughing it'."
Rarity says: "Ooh!"
Sweetie Belle says: "See?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Told you she'd wanna go."
Applejack says: "You packed bug spray?"
Apple Bloom says: "Yup."
Apple Bloom says: "You got the canteens?"
Applejack says: "Yup."
Applejack says: "Looks like we're all set then."
Rarity says: "Hey!"
Applejack says: "Gee, Rarity, did you remember to pack?"
Rarity says: "Oh, well, let's see who gets the last laugh when you're absolutely desperate to curl your lashes, and you realize you didn't bring your eyelash curler."
Applejack says: "Well, looks like we're all set now."
Scootaloo says: "But what about Rainbow Dash?"
Scootaloo says: "Isn't Rainbow Dash coming?"
Applejack says: "'Course she is, sugarcube."
Applejack says: "She's gonna meet us up at our first campsite."
Scootaloo says: "Oh."
Applejack says: "Alright, y'all, let's move 'em out!"
Rarity says: "Oh, are we there yet?"
Applejack says: "The last thousand times you asked that, the answer was no."
Applejack says: "This time, it's actually yes."
Applejack says: "There's Rainbow Dash up there right now."
Scootaloo says: "Hey, Rainbow Dash!"
Scootaloo says: "What's up?"
Rainbow Dash says: "What took you guys so long?"
Applejack says: "Well, some of us didn't pack as light as the others."
Applejack says: "So we were slowed down a bit."
Rainbow Dash says: "Looks like you'll be sharing a tent with me, huh?"
Scootaloo says: "Heh, if that's okay with you."
Rainbow Dash says: "Sure!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Long as you don't snore."
Rainbow Dash says: "You don't snore, do you?"
Scootaloo says: "Nope."
Scootaloo says: "No way."
Scootaloo says: "Not me."
Scootaloo says: "Never snored a day or  night in my life."
Rainbow Dash says: "Then you and I are gonna get along just fine."
Rainbow Dash says: "You have got to be kidding me."
Rarity says: "Sweetie Belle, do be a dear and see if you can find some fresh flowers for my bedside vase."
Rainbow Dash says: "Scootaloo, do be a sweetheart and see if you can gather some firewood."
Rainbow Dash says: "Seriously though."
Rainbow Dash says: "Can you get us some wood for the fire?"
Scootaloo says: "Of course!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay, everybody get comfortable, 'cause I'm about to tell you the best story you've ever heard."
Scootaloo says: "Is it about the time when Rarity had wings, and then they got ruined, and then you saved her from plummeting to her doom?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Okay, maybe it's the second best story you've ever heard."
Rainbow Dash says: "But probably still the scariest."
Rainbow Dash says: "You like scary stories, right?"
Scootaloo says: "Mm-hmm."
Rainbow Dash says: "It all happened on a night just like this one, in a forest, just like this..."
Rainbow Dash says: "..."
Rainbow Dash says: "And then, The Olden Pony asked,  "Who's got my rusty horseshoe?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Not me!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You do!"
Scootaloo says: "Something in my throat."
Scootaloo says: "I wasn't scared at all, heheh."
Scootaloo says: "Good story."
Rainbow Dash says: "Knew you wouldn't be scared."
Rainbow Dash says: "The way you jumped that cart the other day, you're like me – fearless."
Rarity says: "Don't worry."
Rarity says: "Rarity is here to keep you safe and sound."
Rarity says: "Ooh!"
Applejack says: "Think it's about time for me to hit the straw."
Applejack says: "Don't you worry, little sis."
Applejack says: "There's no 'Olden Pony' in our tent."
Scootaloo says: "Haa, that sure was funny, wasn't it?"
Scootaloo says: "Heheh."
Scootaloo says: "How they were all afraid of The Olden Pony?"
Scootaloo says: "Heh, but not me, heh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "That's because you're tough, just like when I was your age!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm hitting the sack."
Rainbow Dash says: "Come in whenever you feel like it."
Scootaloo says: "It's, it's nothing..."
Scootaloo says: "Just my imagination..."
Scootaloo says: "And that isn't the thundering stomp of The Olden Pony..."
Scootaloo says: "I-Is anyone out there?"
The Olden Pony says: "Who got my rusty horseshoe?"
The Olden Pony says: "Who's got my rusty horseshoe?"
Scootaloo says: "Rainbow Dash–?"
The Olden Pony says: "You do!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I dunno about you, but I slept like a filly."
Scootaloo says: "Best night ever."
Rainbow Dash says: "Glad you're rested up, because we've got a long trek ahead."
Rainbow Dash says: "Totally gonna be worth it when we get to Winsome Falls."
Scootaloo says: "Yeah..."
Scootaloo says: "Totally..."
Rarity says: "Ohh..."
Rarity says: "Am I sweating?"
Rarity says: "Oh!"
Rarity says: "I think I'm sweating!"
Rarity says: "Oh, uh, but it's absolutely worth it to get to spend time with my little sister."
Rarity says: "It's just that this cart feels like it's getting heavier all the time!"
Applejack says: "I don't care if that's cart's as heavy as a pack of mules."
Applejack says: "If we don't get a move on, it'll be dark before we get to the campsite!"
Scootaloo says: "I'll just ride ahead and make sure the path is clear."
Scootaloo says: "We don't wanna be out here after dark, right?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Doesn't matter to me."
Scootaloo says: "Well, y'know,  it's for the scaredy-ponies, heheh."
Rarity says: "That's why it's always important to bring your own trunk on any public outing."
Scootaloo says: "Um..."
Scootaloo says: "don't come this way!"
Scootaloo says: "Take the path!"
Scootaloo says: "It's, heh, way better than going through the bushes."
Applejack says: "You're more nervous than a worm in an apple on cider making day."
Applejack says: "What gives, Scootaloo?"
Scootaloo says: "Heh, nothing, just thought I heard something, aheh."
Applejack says: "You sure you're okay?"
Applejack says: "You seem a little jumpy."
Scootaloo says: "Just getting my exercise!"
Scootaloo says: "You know how important it is to stretch out those hindquarters every so often, aheh."
Scootaloo says: "Uh, d-do you need a little help?"
Rarity says: "That's so sweet, thank you."
Scootaloo says: "Um..."
Scootaloo says: "what are friends for?"
Applejack says: "No need for tents tonight, y'all."
Applejack says: "We'll just take shelter in that cave."
Rainbow Dash says: "All right!"
Rainbow Dash says: "A deep, dark cave!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Perfect for the story I've got for tonight."
Rainbow Dash says: "All we need is a campfire, and we're good to go."
Scootaloo says: "Uh, of course..."
Scootaloo says: "I'll be right back with lots of firewood from the deep..."
Scootaloo says: "dark..."
Scootaloo says: "not-scary-at-all forest!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Thanks."
Scootaloo says: "Here, branches branches branches..."
Applejack says: "Bbbbrrr!"
Applejack says: "Hoo-wee!"
Applejack says: "It's colder than a timberwolf's toenail."
Applejack says: "Bbbrr!"
Applejack says: "Where's that Scootaloo?"
Scootaloo says: "Here you go!"
Rainbow Dash says: "That's it?"
Scootaloo says: "It's all I could find, 'cause, y'know, there aren't that many trees around here!"
Applejack says: "It's all we need."
Applejack says: "Why don't you sit with Rainbow Dash for a while?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Now, where was I?"
Scootaloo says: "Hey, I have an idea!"
Scootaloo says: "How about I tell tonight's story?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Alright, just make sure it's a horrible one."
Rainbow Dash says: "No offense, but it's not a real campfire story unless somepony's shaking."
Rainbow Dash says: "I've been told that these very woods are haunted..."
Rainbow Dash says: "..."
Rainbow Dash says: "by The Headless Horse!"
Applejack says: "If it doesn't have a head, then how in tarnation does this pony know where it's goin'?"
Rainbow Dash says: "It's headless, not brainless."
Rainbow Dash says: "..."
Applejack says: "So where's its brain?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh."
Rainbow Dash says: "..."
Rainbow Dash says: "and they were never heard from ever again!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Never?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Never."
Rarity says: "Don't worry, you'll be safe with me tonight."
Scootaloo says: "It's not time for bed yet, is it?"
Applejack says: "'Fraid so, Scootaloo."
Scootaloo says: "Uh, but we haven't even sung any campfire songs yet!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You don't have to ask me twice!"
Rarity says: "Good night, Sweetie Belle."
Applejack says: "Good night, y'all."
Apple Bloom says: "Good night, y'all."
Rainbow Dash says: "Sleep tight."
Scootaloo says: "Oh, just one more song!"
Scootaloo says: "Anyone?"
Scootaloo says: "How about a dance contest?"
Scootaloo says: "I know you love to cut a rug, so how 'bout we mess up a cave floor?"
Scootaloo says: "I have a brilliant idea!"
Scootaloo says: "Hide and seek!"
Scootaloo says: "Who's with me?"
Apple Bloom says: "Maybe tomorrow."
Scootaloo says: "Aww."
Applejack says: "Seems like you don't really wanna go to sleep tonight."
Applejack says: "Is there some reason why?"
Scootaloo says: "Pfft, of course not!"
Scootaloo says: "I just love camping and hanging out with Rainbow Dash so much that I don't wanna waste a single minute with sleep!"
Scootaloo says: "Heh, silly sleep."
Rainbow Dash says: "That's cool and all, Scoot, but this pony needs her shut-eye and she needs it now!"
Scootaloo says: "Ugh, this is so unfair..."
Scootaloo says: "Woah!"
Scootaloo says: "It's all over!"
Scootaloo says: "Aaah!"
Princess Luna says: "A warm welcome to you, Scootaloo."
Scootaloo says: "Princess Luna!"
Scootaloo says: "I thought you were The Headless Horse!"
Princess Luna says: "You were mistaken, but I hope not disappointed."
Scootaloo says: "You are so, so much better than The Headless Horse."
Scootaloo says: "But what are you doing here?"
Scootaloo says: "Shouldn't you be in Canterlot?"
Princess Luna says: "I am the princess of the night."
Princess Luna says: "Thus it is my duty to come into your dreams."
Scootaloo says: "Oh, yeah..."
Scootaloo says: "Wait, is this just a dream?"
Scootaloo says: "But it feels so real!"
Princess Luna says: "I assure you that you are asleep."
Princess Luna says: "But when you awake, the thing that frightens you most will still exist."
Scootaloo says: "Eh..."
Scootaloo says: "The Headless Horse?"
Princess Luna says: "Hmmm..."
Princess Luna says: "Is The Headless Horse really what frightens you the most?"
Scootaloo says: "Mm-mm."
Scootaloo says: "I'm afraid Rainbow Dash will find out I'm not as tough as she thinks I am."
Princess Luna says: "Everypony has fears, Scootaloo."
Princess Luna says: "Everypony must face them in their own way."
Princess Luna says: "But they must be faced, or the nightmares will continue."
Princess Luna says: "Face your fears!"
Scootaloo says: "–Princess Luna?!"
Scootaloo says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "It was just a dream."
Scootaloo says: "But The Headless Horse isn't!"
Scootaloo says: "Rainbow Dash said it lives here, in these very woods!"
Scootaloo says: "It's the wicked whinny of The Headless Horse!"
Scootaloo says: "So it's a horse without a head..."
Scootaloo says: "which means it doesn't have a mouth..."
Scootaloo says: "and if it doesn't have a mouth, then..."
Scootaloo says: "it's not a horse-eat-pony kind of horse..."
Scootaloo says: "but still..."
Scootaloo says: "it's a horse without a head!"
Scootaloo says: "Whoa, whoa!"
Scootaloo says: "Hello?!"
Scootaloo says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "Is anyone out there?"
Scootaloo says: "Anyone except The Headless Horse?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I gotcha!"
Scootaloo says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Scootaloo says: "Is that you?"
Scootaloo says: "Thank you, thank you!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What were you doing out here in the middle of the night?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Princess Luna says: "It is time for you to face your real fear, Scootaloo!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey, I'm gonna tell you something, but if you ever tell anypony else, I'm gonna deny it."
Rainbow Dash says: "First time I heard those stories..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I was scared too."
Scootaloo says: "You were?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Sure!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I mean, I got over it because I realized pretty quick that if there was such thing as a Headless Horse, I could totally take it on."
Rainbow Dash says: "So, you're looking for somepony to take you under their wing, huh?"
Scootaloo says: "Mm-hmm."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, I might be up for something like that."
Scootaloo says: "Really?"
Rainbow Dash says: "As long as you don't go falling into any more rivers in the middle of the night."
Scootaloo says: "It's a deal!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I call sister teams!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Last herd to make it to the falls is a moldy carrot!"
Rarity says: "Ugh, if you insist."
Rarity says: "It is so on!"
Rainbow Dash says: "They think they can beat the two of us?"
The Olden Pony says: "Who's got my rusty horseshoe?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Here it is, for pony's sake."
Rainbow Dash says: "Now take it and stop all your moaning."
The Olden Pony says: "Thank you, and have a nice day."
