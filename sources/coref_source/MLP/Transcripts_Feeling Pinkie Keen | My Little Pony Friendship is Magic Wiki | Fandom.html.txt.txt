Twilight Sparkle says: "Tuh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nuh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nyuh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Eyes over here, Spike!"
Spike says: "Uh, sorry."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh!"
Spike says: "Nyuh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This magic needs our full attention to make it happen."
Twilight Sparkle says: "There's no other way!"
Spike says: "I can't help it."
Spike says: "Look!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh, never mind her."
Twilight Sparkle says: "She's just being Pinkie Pie."
Spike says: "Super-extra Pinkie Pie today."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hmm..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Twitchy twitcha twitcha twitch."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie Pie?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What in the wide, wide world of Equestria are you up to?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's my tail!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's my tail!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's a-twitch a-twitchin'!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And you know what that means!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Actually, Pinkie, I haven't the slightest idea."
Pinkie Pie says: "The twitchin' means my Pinkie Sense is telling me that stuff's gonna start falling!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You two better duck for cover."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Pinkie, it's not gonna rain."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why, there's barely even a cloud in the-ugh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "He just said "nice catch" in Frog."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, I'm so, so sorry."
Fluttershy says: "You okay, Twilight Sparkle?"
Fluttershy says: "I just couldn't stand to see the pond getting so over-populated, what with the frogs all hopping into each other and all, so I decided to fly as many as I can on over to Froggy Bottom Bogg."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Of course you did."
Fluttershy says: "Bye-bye!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Um..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Twilight?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You gotta little somethin' on your face there."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, really?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Did your Pinkie Sense tell you that, too?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Nah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I could just see it."
Pinkie Pie says: "La-la-la-la-la..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "C'mon, Spike, let's continue our practice session where there's a little less commotion."
Spike says: "Wow!"
Spike says: "That was amazing!"
Spike says: "Pinkie Pie predicted something would fall, and it did!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, come on."
Twilight Sparkle says: "She said that something would fall, and a frog just happened to fall right around the same time."
Twilight Sparkle says: "A coincidence, nothing else to it."
Pinkie Pie says: "My tail!"
Pinkie Pie says: "My tail!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Twitch-a-twitch!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Twitch-a-twitch!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Somethin' else is gonna fall!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Pinkie, please."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nothing else is gonna fa-aaah!"
Spike says: "Oh no, Twilight fell!"
Spike says: "Is it..."
Spike says: "safe to go help her?"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's okay, my tail stopped twitching."
Pinkie Pie says: "La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la..."
Spike says: "Ha ha!"
Spike says: "That was amazing!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, please."
Applejack says: "Uh, Twilight?"
Applejack says: "Why are you hanging out in a ditch?"
Spike says: "Because, Pinkie Pie predicted it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Honestly, Spike, she did not."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Two coincidences in a row like this may be unlikely, but it's still easier to believe than twitchy tails that predict the future."
Applejack says: "Twitchy tail?"
Applejack says: "Pinkie Sense?"
Applejack says: "Whoa!"
Applejack says: "Nyu-uh!"
Spike says: "Don't worry, it's safe."
Spike says: "Prediction already came true."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, wait."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Don't tell me you believe in this stuff, too?"
Applejack says: "I know it doesn't make much sense, but those of us who have been in Ponyville a while have learned over time that, if Pinkie's a-twichin', you better listen."
Pinkie Pie says: "My ears are flopping!"
Pinkie Pie says: "My ears are flopping!"
Spike says: "Nyuh!"
Spike says: "What does that mean?!"
Spike says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'll start a bath for you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "A bath?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This thing keeps on getting more ridiculous by the minute!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Sooo, basically, it works like this: I get different, little, niggly feelings and they mean different things."
Pinkie Pie says: "Like when my back is itchy, it means it's my lucky day."
Pinkie Pie says: "And, when my knee gets pinchy, that means something scary's about to happen."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Is your knee pinchy now?"
Pinkie Pie says: "No, but my shoulder's achy."
Pinkie Pie says: "That means there's an alligator in the tub."
Twilight Sparkle says: "How come your knee didn't get pinchy?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That isn't just scary, it's downright dangerous!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No, it's not, silly!"
Pinkie Pie says: "This is my pet alligator, Gummy."
Pinkie Pie says: "He's got no teeth."
Pinkie Pie says: "See?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Haha!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, okay..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I get it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, I still don't believe all this..."
Twilight Sparkle says: ""special power" stuff."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo."
Pinkie Pie says: "What's not to believe?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You do magic, what's the difference?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Huge!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "For one thing,  magic is something you study and practice."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It only happens when you decide to do it, and it's meant to make something specific that you choose to happen, happen."
Twilight Sparkle says: "With you, uh, it makes no sense at all!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's so not true, Twilight!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Sometimes it's a bunch of random things happening to my body at random times that supposedly predict the future."
Pinkie Pie says: "I call 'em "combos"."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Combos?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Sure!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You know, like, ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter."
Pinkie Pie says: "That means the sky is about to be graced with a beautiful rainbow!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yeah, sure."
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh-oh, I feel a combo coming on."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ughhh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You said that combo meant "beautiful rainbow"."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh no-no-no-no-no."
Pinkie Pie says: "You're thinking of an ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter."
Pinkie Pie says: "This was an ear flop, then eye flutter, then knee twitch."
Pinkie Pie says: "That usually means "look out for opening doors"."
Pinkie Pie says: "You okay?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't believe this."
Pinkie Pie says: "You don't believe because you don't understand."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hmm..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now when you get another twitch, we'll have all kinds of scientific information."
Pinkie Pie says: "Okie-dokie-lokie!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Any twitches yet?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Nopey-dopey!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Anything?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hold on!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uhh, no."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Are you kidding me?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "After a whole day of nonstop twitching, now that I've got you all hooked up, you're not getting a single one?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I don't control it, they just come and go."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That makes no sense!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Sometimes you just have to believe in things, even when you can't figure 'em out."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I will not believe in anything I cannot explain."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait, hold on, I'm feeling something..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh my gosh, what?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What is it?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Pinkie Pie's stomach growls.
Pinkie Pie says: "It's my tummy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That usually means I'm hungry!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Let's eat!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Urgh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You know what?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Just forget it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't need to know if this is real or not."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't need to understand it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't even care!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Okie-dokie-lokie."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hu-bu-bu-bu-buh!"
Spike says: "Pinkie?"
Spike says: "Have you seen Twilight?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh-huh."
Spike says: "Twilight?"
Spike says: "What are ya doing back there?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rrrrgh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Did you two plan this?"
Spike says: "Plan what?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Urgh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is ridiculous."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This can't be happening."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This makes no sense."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I have to figure this out."
Spike says: "Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ah!"
Spike says: "Whoa-oh-uh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Honestly, Spike, don't you know better than to sneak up on ponies?"
Spike says: "Oh, sorry, but, um, well, isn't that what you're doing?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm doing scientific research."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm observing Pinkie Pie, scientific name: Pinkius Pieicus, in its natural habitat."
Spike says: "Pinkius-whoicus?"
Spike says: "Hh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "There's something fishy going on with the whole twitchy prediction thing, and I'm getting to the bottom of it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So, shh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Come on, Pinkius Pieicus is on the move."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hm..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Itchy nose..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Aha!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That makes no sense."
Twilight Sparkle says: "See?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "She's hiding like something's about to fall from the sky, but a twitchy tail means something's gonna fall from the sky, not an itchy nose."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This proves..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "perhaps conclusively, that—"
Spike says: "Gah!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where are you going?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm trying to teach you the value of scientific—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ow!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ouch!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ow!"
Spike says: "What's she doing now?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Smelling a flower."
Spike says: "Holy guacamole!"
Spike says: "I wonder what that means?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Probably that the flower smells good."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wait."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm getting something."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch."
Spike says: "Hold on..."
Spike says: "You told me that's the combo that says "watch out for opening doors"!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh-ho."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You really, really believe this stuff, don't you?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Here, let me show you there's nothing to be afraid of."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You see?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I promise you there's nothing to fear from that—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Wo-o-ah!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ow!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ow!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ow!"
Applejack says: "Twilight!"
Applejack says: "You came to visit my new apple cellar, how nice."
Applejack says: "Twi?"
Applejack says: "You okay?"
Applejack says: "Uh, Twi?"
Spike says: "Here, let me help you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay, take this down: twitchy tail."
Spike says: "Twitchy tail?"
Spike says: "Twitchy tail!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hush, Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We can't let Pinkie know we're here, remember?"
Spike says: "Something's gonna fall, something's gonna fall!"
Spike says: "Run for your lives."
Spike says: "Ah-ha-ha!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh, Spike honestly, you're overreact—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, Applejack."
Pinkie Pie says: "Whatcha doin'?"
Applejack says: "Takin' more apples to my new apple cellar."
Applejack says: "How 'bout you, Pinkie?"
Applejack says: "Whatchu doin'?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, letting Twilight secretly follow me all day without me knowing."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You mean you knew all along?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why didn't you tell me?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Silly, that would've spoiled the secret!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Urgh!"
Spike says: "Tail..."
Spike says: "still twitching?"
Pinkie Pie says: "All done, clear skies from here on in, as far as I can tell—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!"
Spike says: "Oh no!"
Spike says: "What does that one mean?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Dunno, never gotten any like it before, but whatever that shudder's about, it's a doozy."
Pinkie Pie says: "Something you'd never expect to happen is gonna happen!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu hu-bu-bu-bu!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And it's gonna happen..."
Pinkie Pie says: "at Froggy Bottom Bogg!"
Applejack says: "That's where Fluttershy's headed!"
Spike says: "Oh no!"
Spike says: "Is it about her?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, I'm not sure."
Applejack says: "We better go and make sure she's okay."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Calm down, everypony."
Twilight Sparkle says: "All we know right now is that Pinkie Pie just got a case of the shivers."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's all."
Spike says: "Guh—"
Spike says: "Hey!"
Spike says: "I thought you didn't believe in this stuff?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I just want to be there to see the look on Pinkie's face when we find out nothing's wrong."
Pinkie Pie says: "Okie-dokie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Cold?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Need a jacket or something?"
Pinkie Pie says: "No thanks, I'm fine."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!"
Spike says: "So..."
Spike says: "Whadda'ya think happened to Fluttershy?"
Applejack says: "I hope nothin'."
Spike says: "I know, but, whadda'ya think happened?"
Applejack says: "I'm tryin' not to think about it."
Spike says: "Me too."
Spike says: "But I'm thinkin' about it anyway."
Spike says: "Like, what if she exploded?"
Applejack says: "Just exploded?"
Applejack says: "For no reason?"
Spike says: "Yeah, like boom!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "I know."
Pinkie Pie says: "What if..."
Pinkie Pie says: "What if she exploded, and then..."
Pinkie Pie says: "and then exploded again!"
Pinkie Pie says: "?"
Spike says: "Can you do that?"
Spike says: "Can you explode twice?"
Applejack says: "Of course not."
Spike says: "But what if she exploded, and exploded again, and then—"
Spike says: "ugh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Will you two stop?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "She's fine, I'm sure of it."
Applejack says: "I hope you're right, for Fluttershy's sake."
Applejack says: "Look!"
Applejack says: "There's Froggy Bottom Bogg!"
Applejack says: "Fluttershy?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Fluttershy?"
Spike says: "Fluttershy!"
Spike says: "You're okay!"
Fluttershy says: "Of course."
Applejack says: "Phew, what a relief."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm so glad everything's all right."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sorry, I know it's not nice to gloat but..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Aha!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I told you there was nothing to worry about, and I was right."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie Pie said whatever she was shuddering about was a  doozy here is how right I am."
Applejack says: "Um..."
Applejack says: "Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie's made a lot of predictions today but  in anything you can't see for yourself."
Spike says: "W-Well t-then, s-see what's b-b-behind you, Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I see it..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "but I don't believe it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Is that a hydra?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Applejack says: "Who cares?"
Applejack says: "Run!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Come on!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooph!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, I'm so sorry."
Fluttershy says: "Ah!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Everypony up that hill!"
Spike says: "He-e-elp!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Coming, Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hang on!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I think we're gonna make it."
Spike says: "But Pinkie's still shuddering!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, lookie there, it stopped."
Pinkie Pie says: "O-h-h-h, t-h-e-r-e i-t i-s a-g-a-i-n!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh, he'll be up here in no time!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Quick, one at a time, cross!"
Spike says: "Nyu-uh!"
Spike says: "Uh, do you know any spells for turning a hydra into a mouse?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No."
Spike says: "How about a squirrel?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No!"
Spike says: "How 'bout—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No small rodents of any kind!"
Spike says: "That's too bad."
Fluttershy says: "A hop, skip, and a..."
Fluttershy says: "jump!"
Spike says: "Whoa-ho!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!"
Twilight says: "He's too close."
Twilight says: "I'll distract him."
Twilight says: "You two go, now!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What would a brave pony like Rainbow Dash do?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Chaaarge!"
Pinkie Pie says: "T-T-T-Twilight!"
Pinkie Pie says: "T-T-T-Twilight!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You have to jump!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll never make it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You'll be fine!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I will not!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's your only ho-o-ope!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You have to take a leap of faith!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Y-ugh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh no!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Noooo!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "WA-A-A-AH!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Blegh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I knew you could do it, Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't know how it happened; coincidence, dumb luck, or what, but you said there'd be a doozy here at Froggy Bottom Bogg, and I'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I mean that hydra—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie?"
Pinkie Pie says: "That wasn't it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Huh?"
Spike says: "What wasn't what?"
Applejack says: "What are you talking about, Pink?"
Pinkie Pie says: "The hydra wasn't the doozy."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm still getting the shudders."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oo-o-oh, oo-o-oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You see?"
Pinkie Pie says: "There it is again."
Pinkie Pie says: "Whatever the doozy was at Froggy Bottom Bogg, my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But I—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "WHAT?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The hydra wasn't the doozy?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "How could it not be the doozy?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What could be doozier than that?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Dunno, but it just wasn't it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rrrgh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ooh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I give up..."
Spike says: "Give what up, Twi?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The fight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can't fight it anymore."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't understand how, why, or what, but Pinkie Sense somehow..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "makes sense."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't see how it does, but it just does."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Just because I don't understand doesn't mean it's not true."
Pinkie Pie says: "Y-Y-Y-You m-m-mean you b-b-b-believe?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yup, I guess I do."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oo-woo-oo-oo-oo, woo-oo-oo-oo-oh, woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That was it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's the doozy!"
Spike says: "Bbrrbbrrbbrr."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What is?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You believing!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I never expected that to happen!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That was the doozy, oh and, oh what a doozy of a doozy it was!"
Pinkie Pie says: "La-la-la-la-la..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, good, Spike, you're here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Take a letter."
Spike says: "With pleasure, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Dear Princess Celestia, I'm happy to report that—"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, what have I been saying about focus?"
Spike says: "I know, but I..."
Spike says: "Well..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's wrong, Spike?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Never thought you'd see me with an umbrella hat on?"
Spike says: "Not really, no."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie's tail's a-twitchin'."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What else can I do?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I am happy to report that I now realize there are wonderful things in this world you just can't explain, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less true."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It just means you have to choose to believe in them, and sometimes it takes a friend to show you the way."
Pinkie Pie says: "Honk!"
Spike says: "Honk."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Always your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."
Pinkie Pie says: "There it goes again."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I wonder what's gonna drop outta the sky this time?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You never know."
Spike says: "Twitchy tail?"
Spike says: "Holy guacamole!"
