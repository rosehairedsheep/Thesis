Rainbow Dash says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Applejack says: "Hoo-wee!"
Applejack says: "Not a bad pitch for a pony who works with her head in the clouds."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh yeah?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Think you can do better, cowgirl?"
Applejack says: "I know I can."
Applejack says: "Oh, for Pete's sake!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Looks like this Pegasus can pitch better than the workhorse."
Rainbow Dash says: "The object of the game is to get the closest to the stake."
Applejack says: "All right, all right."
Applejack says: "You got another throw there, pony girl."
Applejack says: "Wow, Rainbow, heh."
Applejack says: "You couldn't hit a barn door with that kind of a throw!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, yeah."
Rainbow Dash says: "I still have the closest throw, Applesmack."
Rainbow Dash says: "Just try and beat it."
Applejack says: "Yee-haw!"
Applejack says: "It's a ringer."
Applejack says: "That's how you do it down here on the farm."
Rainbow Dash says: "I lost."
Applejack says: "Ah, don't feel bad, Rainbow."
Applejack says: "It's all in good fun."
Rainbow Dash says: "I hate losing."
Applejack says: "Besides, you're a mighty good athlete."
Applejack says: "I'm just better."
Applejack says: "Heh heh heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "All right, Applejack, you think you're the top athlete in all of Ponyville?"
Applejack says: "Well, I was gonna say in all of Equestria, but that might be gildin' the lily."
Rainbow Dash says: "..."
Rainbow Dash says: "and I think I'm the top athlete."
Rainbow Dash says: "So let's prove it."
Applejack says: "Prove what?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I challenge you to an Iron Pony competition."
Rainbow Dash says: "A series of athletic contests to decide who's the best, once and for all."
Applejack says: "You know what, Rainbow?"
Applejack says: "You're on."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So you two are doing what, now?"
Applejack says: "An Iron—"
Rainbow Dash says: "Iron Pony competition."
Applejack says: "See, we've set up a bunch of events to decide which one of us is—"
Rainbow Dash says: "The most athletic pony ever!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And I'm here to..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I don't know."
Rainbow Dash says: "Why is she here?"
Applejack says: "To be our judge and keep score."
Rainbow Dash says: "Right, heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Somepony's gotta record my awesomeness for the history books."
Spike says: "Hello everypony, and welcome to the first annual Iron Pony competition!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uh, Spike, who are you talking to?"
Spike says: "Um..."
Spike says: "uh, them!"
Spike says: "Let the games begin!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ready."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Set."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Go!"
Applejack says: "Dagnabbit."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Time, Spike?"
Spike says: "17 seconds."
Applejack says: "You're kiddin'!"
Applejack says: "That breaks my record from last year's rodeo."
Spike says: "But you got a five second penalty for nudging the barrel."
Applejack says: "Nuts and chews!"
Applejack says: "Still, that's twenty-two seconds."
Applejack says: "Not too shabby."
Applejack says: "Hey, don't be nervous."
Applejack says: "Remember, it's all in good fun."
Applejack says: "Now git on up there."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ready."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Set."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Go!"
Applejack says: "Woo!"
Applejack says: "That was some fancy hoofwork there, Rainbow!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Thanks, but I  couldn't have been as fast as you."
Applejack says: "What was the time on that, Spike?"
Spike says: "18 seconds!"
Applejack says: "18 seconds."
Applejack says: "Rainbow, are you sure you're not secretly a rodeo pony?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash wins the barrel lead!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, I can't believe I won."
Applejack says: "Yeah, well, don't you go gettin' used to it."
Applejack says: "Years of applebuckin'."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh."
Granny Smith says: "Waa-hoo!"
Apple Bloom says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup!"
Spike says: "Why me?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Go!"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "Whoa-hoa!"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "Whoaaa!"
Spike says: "Ouch."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ready for another pony ride?"
Spike says: "No."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Go!"
Spike says: "Guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guhwhoaaaaaa!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash wins the bronco-buck."
Spike says: "And I lose."
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "How do I get roped into these things?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Does this count?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yuh!"
Applejack says: "Wah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah."
Spike says: "Fillies and gentlecolts, at the halfway point, our competitors are tied at five and five."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Who are you talking to?"
Spike says: "Them!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "a hundred!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yes!"
Applejack says: "Be a good sport, Applejack."
Twilight Sparkle says: "All right, you two."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is the final event."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Give it all you've got."
Spike says: "Looks like the workhorse might come out ahead in this one."
Applejack says: "That's not fair."
Applejack says: "You can't use your wings to help you win."
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh?"
Applejack says: "You're cheatin'!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I can't understand you with that rope in your mouth."
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I win by a landslide..."
Rainbow Dash says: "or mudslide in your case."
Rainbow Dash says: "I am the Iron Pony!"
Applejack says: "Only 'cause you cheated!"
Rainbow Dash says: "What?"
Applejack says: "You used your wingpower to help you win over half those contests!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Sounds like sour apples to me."
Applejack says: "Are you sayin' you didn't use your wings?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Well..."
Rainbow Dash says: "no."
Rainbow Dash says: "But you never said I couldn't use my wings."
Applejack says: "I didn't think I needed to tell you to play fair."
Rainbow Dash says: "I still would have won even without my wings."
Applejack says: "Hah!"
Applejack says: "Prove it."
Rainbow Dash says: "Gladly."
Rainbow Dash says: "How?"
Applejack says: "Tomorrow is the annual Runnin' of the Leaves."
Applejack says: "I challenge you to race me in it."
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Easy shmeasy."
Applejack says: "Hold on!"
Applejack says: "There is one condition: the point is to run, so no wings allowed."
Rainbow Dash says: "No wings?"
Rainbow Dash says: "No problem."
Spike says: "Twilight, hurry up, we're gonna be late for the race."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Why are you so excited about the race?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's only for ponies."
Spike says: "Yeah, but I'm hoping I can be the announcer again."
Pinkie Pie says: "Welcome to the annual Running of the Leaves!"
Pinkie Pie says: "This is Pinkie Pie, your official p-eye-in-the-sky announcer."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sorry, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I guess that job's already taken."
Pinkie Pie says: "As everypony knows, the Running is a very important tradition, for without it, the autumn leaves of Equestria would never fall."
Pinkie Pie says: "So get ready, ponies."
Pinkie Pie says: "The Running of the Leaves will begin in five minutes."
Rainbow Dash says: "Pardon me, excuse me."
Rainbow Dash says: "Make way for the Iron Pony."
Applejack says: "The Iron Phony, you mean."
Rainbow Dash says: "So, Applejack, you ready to win second place?"
Applejack says: "I'm ready to run a good, clean race."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, yeah..."
Applejack says: "You are not allowed to use your wings."
Rainbow Dash says: "I could win this race with both wings tied behind my back."
Applejack says: "Trussed up like a turkey."
Applejack says: "Well, a turkey who can't fly, that is."
Rainbow Dash says: "Very funny."
Applejack says: "'Least now we know we're racin' fair and square."
Pinkie Pie says: "Racers!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Please take your positions!"
Spike says: "Um..."
Spike says: "Pinkie Pie?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, Spike!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What's up?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh wait, it's me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm up!"
Spike says: "Uh, yeah."
Spike says: "I know you're doing the announcing today and stuff and..."
Spike says: "I'm sure you're gonna do a great job and all, but..."
Spike says: "I was just wondering..."
Pinkie Pie says: "What?"
Spike says: "Aw..."
Spike says: "forget it."
Pinkie Pie says: "Spike, would you like to be my co-reporter?"
Pinkie Pie says: "We could comment on the action together."
Spike says: "We could?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Climb on up!"
Applejack says: "Twilight?"
Applejack says: "What in tarnation are you doin' up here?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm racing."
Rainbow Dash says: "Good one, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm not joking."
Rainbow Dash says: "What?"
Rainbow Dash says: "You're not an athlete, you're a..."
Rainbow Dash says: "well..."
Rainbow Dash says: "you're an egghead."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I am not an egghead, I am well-read."
Rainbow Dash says: "Egghead."
Applejack says: "But have you ever run a race?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, no, but I do know a lot about running."
Rainbow Dash says: "And you know this from..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Books."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've read several on the subject."
Rainbow Dash says: "What'd you read, "The Egghead's Guide to Running"?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Did you stretch out your eye muscles to warm up?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Get it?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Eye muscles."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Scoff if you must, Rainbow."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But the Running of the Leaves is a Ponyville tradition, and since I'm here to learn, I've decided I should experience it myself."
Applejack says: "Well, I think that's just dandy, Twilight."
Applejack says: "Good luck."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah."
Rainbow Dash says: "See you at the finish line..."
Rainbow Dash says: "tomorrow."
Pinkie Pie says: "All right, ponies, are you ready?"
Spike says: "Get set."
Pinkie Pie says: "And they're off!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Welcome to the official coverage of the Running of the Leaves!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You know, Spike, despite its name, the leaves don't do any of the actual running."
Pinkie Pie says: "No, that's left to my little ponies."
Spike says: "Why, yes, Pinkie, it's the running of the ponies that causes the leaves to fall."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ugh."
Pinkie Pie says: "Those lazy, lazy leaves."
Pinkie Pie says: "But this year, the run is about more than the weather."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's about the race to the finish and the two runners who want to win it: Applejack and Rainbow Dash."
Spike says: "You know, Pinkie, these two ponies have a bit of a grudge match they're trying to settle."
Spike says: "Trying to prove who's the most athletic."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yes, and "grudge" rhymes with "fudge"."
Spike says: "Yes, it..."
Spike says: "does."
Spike says: "What?"
Pinkie Pie says: "And I like fudge."
Pinkie Pie says: "But if I eat too much fudge I get a pudge and then I can't budge."
Spike says: "So..."
Spike says: "no fudge?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, no thanks."
Pinkie Pie says: "I had a big breakfast."
Pinkie Pie says: "Let's check in with our two competitive ponies, Applejack and Rainbow Dash."
Pinkie Pie says: "Having come fast out of the gate, Applejack and Rainbow Dash are evenly matched running neck and neck."
Pinkie Pie says: "But what's this?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Applejack is making a move, she's now ahead by a nose."
Pinkie Pie says: "But Rainbow Dash won't let Applejack have it and takes the lead."
Pinkie Pie says: "She's ahead by half a nose."
Pinkie Pie says: "Or maybe three quarters of a nose."
Pinkie Pie says: "No, about sixty-three point seven percent of a nose..."
Pinkie Pie says: "roughly speaking."
Pinkie Pie says: "Applejack sees this move and pushes forth with her strong workhorse legs slinking ahead by three hundred and fifty noses!"
Applejack says: "Not so easy without wings, is it?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on, Rainbow."
Rainbow Dash says: "Show 'em a little dash."
Spike says: "Ho-hold your horses, Pinkie!"
Spike says: "Rainbow Dash is catching up the frontrunner Applejack!"
Pinkie Pie says: "What an upset."
Pinkie Pie says: "I thought Applejack had this in the bag."
Rainbow Dash says: "You didn't think I was gonna let you off that easily, did you?"
Applejack says: "Whoa!"
Applejack says: "I don't believe it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know, it's beautiful, isn't it?"
Applejack says: "Not the scenery, Twilight."
Applejack says: "Rainbow Dash just tripped me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "She did not."
Applejack says: "She did too!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "She did not, and if you slowed down and looked where you're going, like me, you'd see that you tripped over a rock."
Applejack says: "What?"
Applejack says: "Oh, hayseed!"
Applejack says: "Now I got a lot of ground to make up to catch Rainbow."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Just be careful!"
Applejack says: "See you at the finish line!"
Spike says: "I don't believe it."
Spike says: "After a huge setback, Applejack is back at the front of the pack."
Pinkie Pie says: "She's the head of the pack, all right."
Pinkie Pie says: "The pick of the litter!"
Pinkie Pie says: "The cat's pajamas!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh wait, why would Applejack take some poor kitty's PJs?"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's not very sporting of her."
Spike says: "Oookay..."
Spike says: "let's get back to the race."
Rainbow Dash says: "Not so fast, Applejack!"
Rainbow Dash says: "This race isn't over yet!"
Applejack says: "It is for you."
Applejack says: "Heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Guh, I don't believe it, Applejack tripped me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Don't you ponies ever look where you're going?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You tripped on a stump."
Twilight Sparkle says: "See?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, I see."
Rainbow Dash says: "A big cheater is what I see."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow, Applejack would never cheat."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It was just an accident."
Rainbow Dash says: "Sure it was."
Rainbow Dash says: "I mean, yeah, I'm sure it was."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Remember, Rainbow, this is just a game."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yes, but the rules have changed, and two can play at that game."
Pinkie Pie says: "Welcome back, Ponyvillians, it's me, Pinkie Pie."
Spike says: "And Spike."
Spike says: "Looks like Rainbow is doing her best to catch up."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm not sure how ketchup is going to help her in this contest."
Pinkie Pie says: "Now, in a hot dog eating contest it can make them doggies nice and slippery, but personally, I prefer mustard."
Pinkie Pie says: "How about you, Spike?"
Spike says: "Uh..."
Spike says: "I..."
Spike says: "like..."
Spike says: "pickles?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Aaand it looks like Applejack has found herself in quite a pickle as Rainbow overtakes her."
Rainbow Dash says: "Look, ma, no wings."
Spike says: "As the racers enter Equestria's Whitetail Wood, Rainbow Dash is back in the lead."
Applejack says: "Ugh."
Applejack says: "Hey, Rainbow!"
Applejack says: "Why, that little cheater did that on purpose."
Applejack says: "It's on."
Rainbow Dash says: "Nice one, Rainbow."
Applejack says: "Later!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Grr!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh my, Whitetail Wood is just lovely."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey, Rainbow, shouldn't you be up ahead?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm sure I'll win now."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Except that the other racers just passed you."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh horse apples..."
Rainbow Dash says: "see ya!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Applejack, what are you doing up here?"
Spike says: "There aren't even any trees."
Applejack says: "Er, no, but the sign's pointed this way..."
Applejack says: "Rainbow."
Applejack says: "Mind giving me a lift?"
Rainbow Dash says: "What the hay?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You said no flying!"
Applejack says: "No, I said no wings."
Pinkie Pie says: "I must say, Spike, that this has been the most interesting Running of the Leaves in Equestria history!"
Spike says: "With the most interesting announcing..."
Pinkie Pie says: "But it isn't the running that's been fascinating."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's the lack of running!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Aaa!"
Applejack says: "Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Whoa!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Forgive me, girls."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know I'm not an athlete, but shouldn't the Running of the Leaves actually involve running?"
Rainbow Dash says: "You know, I think Twilight's right."
Applejack says: "You do?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "If you wanna beat me, you better..."
Rainbow Dash says: "RUUUN!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Once again, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are neck and neck, jockeying for position."
Pinkie Pie says: "Applejack inches ahead, now it's Rainbow, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack..."
Spike says: "Oh no, she di'int!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh yes, she di'id!"
Applejack says: "Cut it out!"
Rainbow Dash says: "No, you cut it out!"
Applejack says: "You started it."
Rainbow Dash says: "And now I'm gonna finish it."
Applejack says: "Oh no, you won't."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh yes, I will."
Rainbow Dash says: "That's it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "All bets are off!"
Applejack says: "Oh no, you don't."
Rainbow Dash says: "I won!"
Applejack says: "No, I won!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I won!"
Spike says: "You tied!"
Applejack says: "Tied?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Tied?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Applejack says: "For first?"
Pinkie Pie says: "For last!"
Applejack says: "Last?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Then who won?"
Applejack says: "You?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh no, but I did get fifth place, which is rather good considering I've never run a race before."
Applejack says: "What?"
Applejack says: "How's that even possible?"
Rainbow Dash says: "You ran so slow, and looked at the scenery."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Exactly."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I paced myself, just like my book said."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Then at the end, when all the other ponies were worn out, I sprinted to the finish."
Rainbow Dash says: "I don't believe it."
Rainbow Dash says: "Twilight beat us."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, with all your horsing around, it was quite easy."
Applejack says: "You're right, Twilight."
Applejack says: "Our behavior was just terrible."
Rainbow Dash says: "We weren't very good sports."
Princess Celestia says: "Sounds to me that an important lesson was learned."
Applejack says: "Princess Celestia?!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Princess Celestia?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Rainbow Dash says: "!"
Applejack says: "W-What are you doin' here?"
Princess Celestia says: "Fall is one of my favorite seasons, so I came to celebrate the Running of the Leaves."
Applejack says: "I'm sorry you had to see us being such poor sports, Princess."
Princess Celestia says: "That's all right, Applejack."
Princess Celestia says: "Anypony can get swept up in the excitement of competition."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's important to remember that the friendship is always more important than the competition."
Princess Celestia says: "Exactly, Twilight."
Princess Celestia says: "Now, unfortunately, because the two of you were busy tricking each other instead of shaking down leaves, many of the lovely trees of Equestria are still covered."
Applejack says: "Why, Princess, I bet we can knock those leaves down for you lickety-split."
Applejack says: "Whaddya say, friend?"
Applejack says: "Wanna go for another run?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'd love to stretch my legs."
