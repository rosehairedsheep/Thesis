Starlight Glimmer says: "I know!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I can't believe it either!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "The map has never called me before!"
Spike says: "I'm sure that's not why she looks..."
Spike says: "like that."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I also wasn't nervous before, but now..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Don't worry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "For all we know, it's something small."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Like maybe the cooks are fighting over who has the best butternut squash soup."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Or the royal hairdressers are fighting over a comb."
Spike says: "Or, you know, maybe the royal sisters aren't seeing eye-to-eye on something."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's just crazy!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Luna and Celestia would never fight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Again."
Princess Celestia says: "So the map sent you to solve a friendship problem?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Yes, princess."
Princess Celestia says: "Well, there's nothing wrong here."
Princess Celestia says: "Right, sister?"
Princess Luna says: "No."
Princess Luna says: "Everything's perfect as usual, sister."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Psst!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pssst!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Twilight?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Is that you?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "How are you here?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm not."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm still home."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's an easy spell."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll show you later."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Anyway, enough about me."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I had to check on you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not in a meddling kind of way!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "In a friendly "how's it going?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "" kind of way."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So, how's it going?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Not great."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I think the problem might be between Celestia and Luna."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, no, that's terrible!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I mean, what makes you say that?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "You know how some ponies say nothing's wrong but you can tell something's definitely wrong?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Noooooo..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Heh."
Starlight Glimmer says: "That's basically what the princesses did when I said there was a friendship problem."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Only they did it more, you know, regally."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, I wish I could help you, but I can't – both for map reasons and because I have no idea!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is big!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Like, really big!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "But I'm here if you ever need to talk."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Or listen to music."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Heh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Comforting, right?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Thank you so much for breakfast, princess."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I can't believe you cook it yourself."
Princess Celestia says: "Of course, Starlight!"
Princess Celestia says: "I really enjoy doing it."
Princess Celestia says: "It's a small way to say I care."
Princess Celestia says: "Good morning, sister!"
Princess Celestia says: "Join us?"
Princess Luna says: "Please excuse me."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Wow."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Last night must've been really hard on her."
Princess Celestia says: "Perhaps."
Princess Celestia says: "But she is like this every morning."
Starlight Glimmer says: "So I think Luna may be hurting her sister's feelings without even realizing it."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Poor Celestia."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's so sweet that she makes her sister pancakes every morning."
Starlight Glimmer says: "She's your mentor."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I think you might be biased."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fair enough."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So what are you gonna do?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Nothing, yet."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I have to get all the facts."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I asked Luna if I could spend some time with her this evening."
Guard says: "Princess Luna's waiting for you, miss."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Good luck, Starlight!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Wow, Princess Luna."
Starlight Glimmer says: "You do this every night?"
Princess Luna says: "Lavender's calming scent is known to aid dreamers in achieving a restorative sleep."
Starlight Glimmer says: "That's so thoughtful!"
Princess Luna says: "I try my best to make sure the ponies in this castle sleep peacefully."
Fleur De Verre says: "And so, then I said, "Touring?"
Fleur De Verre says: "More like 'boring'!"
Princess Celestia says: "Oh, you really are a card!"
Princess Luna says: "But as always, my sister is too busy having fun with dignitary ponies to acknowledge anything I do."
Princess Luna says: "Hmph!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "So, both princesses are hurting each other without realizing it."
Starlight Glimmer says: "And instead of talking about it, they're just getting colder and more distant."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And they're Celestia and Luna."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So it's not like you can just confront them."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Actually, that's exactly what I was gonna do."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Are you crazy?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I mean, heh, you do whatever you think is best."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is your mission."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Gee, thanks for believing in me, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I do."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But the last time the princesses fought, Luna turned into Nightmare Moon, and Princess Celestia had to banish her for a thousand years!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That can't happen again!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Well, I can't do nothing."
Starlight Glimmer says: "The princesses aren't the best at communicating with each other."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Sorry."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's just, you said "princesses" and "aren't the best" in the same sentence, and it's making me nervous!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm not much help, am I?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "No!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Wow."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I almost feel bad eating this."
Starlight Glimmer says: "It's adorable."
Princess Celestia says: "Like I said, I enjoy this part."
Princess Luna says: "Hi."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Uh, Princess Luna!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Wait!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "As you both know, the map sent me here for a reason, and I..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "think I found out what it is."
Princess Celestia says: "Really?"
Princess Celestia says: "Oh, that is wonderful, Starlight!"
Princess Celestia says: "What is it?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "You two."
Princess Celestia says: "Excuse me?"
Princess Luna says: "I beg your pardon?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I think you're accidentally hurting each other's feelings without realizing it."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Princess Celestia, does it bother you that Luna never notices the wonderful breakfasts that you prepare for her?"
Princess Celestia says: "Uh..."
Princess Celestia says: "Y-Yes."
Princess Celestia says: "It does."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Princess Luna, tell Celestia how you feel about the fact that she never acknowledges the work you put into lining the hallway with lavender every night."
Princess Luna says: "I..."
Princess Luna says: "Well, I..."
Princess Luna says: "I-It's not the best feeling."
Princess Luna says: "I'm sorry I never noticed that you make fruit faces on pancakes, but nights are long for me."
Princess Luna says: "You might be a morning pony, but I am half-asleep."
Princess Celestia says: "You think I don't get tired?"
Princess Celestia says: "I'm exhausted!"
Princess Celestia says: "Oh, I apologize for not noticing flowers in a wall sconce."
Princess Celestia says: "But by the time I get to retire for the night, I can barely see straight!"
Princess Celestia says: "Even so, I still make an effort to smile!"
Princess Luna says: "Like smiling is so hard."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I-I-I'm sure that's not what Princess Luna meant to say."
Princess Luna says: "Is that what exhausts you?"
Princess Luna says: "Smiling and being adored by everypony?"
Princess Celestia says: "And you have it so much worse, do you?!"
Princess Celestia says: "!"
Princess Celestia says: "You've spent your evenings flitting around giving ponies lovely dreams!"
Princess Celestia says: "Oh, it sounds just awful!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Okay!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I feel like we should step back, take a deep breath..."
Princess Luna says: "Don't presume to know what it is like to govern the dream realm!"
Princess Celestia says: "And yet you know exactly what it's like to be me?!"
Princess Celestia says: "!"
Princess Celestia says: "Oh, please!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Enough!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "There!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Now you'll know exactly what it's like to..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "be each other."
Princess Celestia says: "What have you done?!"
Princess Celestia says: "!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "went with my gut?"
Princess Luna says: "Switch our cutie marks back this instant!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "My apologies, your majesties!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "But I can't, even if I wanted to."
Starlight Glimmer says: "The spell lasts twenty-four hours."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I-It may have been extreme, but, uh, I think it's still a good idea?"
Princess Celestia says: "What?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Y-You said it yourselves!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Neither of you believes your sister knows how hard it is to be you."
Starlight Glimmer says: "So this is your chance to prove it."
Princess Luna says: "Well, I could use an easy day followed by a good night's sleep."
Princess Celestia says: "You can try."
Princess Celestia says: "I haven't had an easy day in, well, ever!"
Princess Celestia says: "But now, I get to sleep, and tonight will be a breeze."
Princess Celestia says: "All right, Starlight Glimmer."
Princess Celestia says: "We will do this."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Good choice!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Not that you had one."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I'm gonna stop talking now."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You switched their cutie marks?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The actual princesses' cutie marks?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I thought we moved past this."
Starlight Glimmer says: "It was the right call!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I hope."
Guard says: "Are you okay in there?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I-I'm good!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Just, uh..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "reading an exciting book!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "He's gonna think I'm nuts!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "He's not the only one."
Princess Luna says: "As you can see, Celestia and I are switching places today."
Princess Luna says: "I assure you, I am more than capable of handling all of Celestia's, heh, duties."
Princess Luna says: "Dismissed."
Princess Luna says: "So, what is first on my dear sister's to-do list?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "It says you have a few public appearances."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Store openings, judging the royal rose contest..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "You know, that sort of thing."
Princess Luna says: "Oh, I knew today would be easy, but I didn't think it would be that easy."
Princess Luna says: ""Princess Luna Unhappy with Student Fundraiser"?"
Princess Luna says: "But I wasn't unhappy!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Um, you are scowling."
Princess Luna says: "Well, I-I didn't mean to!"
Princess Luna says: "I've been smiling all day!"
Princess Luna says: "My cheeks hurt!"
Princess Luna says: "I stopped for one second!"
Princess Luna says: "And that's when he took the picture!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Guess smiling all day isn't as easy as you thought?"
Princess Luna says: "It says here that, because of me, the school didn't raise enough funds to go on their field trip!"
Princess Luna says: "I-I didn't mean for that to happen!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I know."
Starlight Glimmer says: "But you can't dwell on that now."
Starlight Glimmer says: "According to the list, some delegates are about to arrive for a luncheon."
Starlight Glimmer says: "You need to dispel rumors of timberwolves in the White Tail Woods."
Starlight Glimmer says: "The nearby towns have been in a state of panic for weeks."
Princess Luna says: "B-B-But I have to fix this!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "You can't."
Starlight Glimmer says: "You need to put on a brave face and help these ponies."
Starlight Glimmer says: "It's what Celestia would do."
Princess Luna says: "Hello!"
Princess Luna says: "Great news!"
Princess Luna says: "There are no timberwolves!"
Delegate Ponies says: "No, there are definitely timberwolves!"
Princess Luna says: "I'm sorry."
Princess Luna says: "But I couldn't stop thinking about those poor students."
Princess Luna says: "Normally, I have all the time in solitude I need to work through my problems at my own pace."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Well, your sister doesn't get that luxury."
Mayor Cream Cheese says: "The princess will definitely side with me!"
Mayor Baltimare says: "Please see reason, Mayor Cream Cheese!"
Mayor Baltimare says: "I'm telling you, Baltimare..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Ready for the town hall?"
Mayor Baltimare says: "Glad that's settled."
Mayor Cream Cheese says: "And it only took three hours."
Mayor Baltimare says: "That got heated, didn't it?"
Mayor Cream Cheese says: "Still on for golf?"
Mayor Baltimare says: "Oh, absolutely."
Starlight Glimmer says: "You made it to the end of the day."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Yay?"
Princess Luna says: "Hmm?"
Princess Luna says: "Oh."
Princess Luna says: "Yes, uh..."
Princess Celestia says: "Oh, hello, Starlight."
Princess Celestia says: "I don't know about you, but I feel very well-rested."
Princess Celestia says: "Where's Luna?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Um, uh, she already turned in for the night."
Princess Celestia says: "Did she now?"
Princess Celestia says: "It seems my duties were harder than my sister expected."
Princess Celestia says: "Moon raised!"
Princess Celestia says: "It's even easier than raising the sun."
Princess Celestia says: "What's next?"
Princess Celestia says: "Of course."
Princess Celestia says: "Everypony's asleep at night."
Princess Celestia says: "Heh."
Princess Celestia says: "Luna works alone..."
Princess Celestia says: "Oh, but it's nothing I can't handle."
Princess Celestia says: "All I have to do is watch over Equestria, visit the dream realm, and protect ponies in their nightmares."
Princess Celestia says: "My list was three times as long!"
Princess Celestia says: "All right."
Princess Celestia says: "Everypony's asleep."
Princess Celestia says: "You're talking to yourself, Celestia."
Princess Celestia says: "Heh."
Princess Celestia says: "But there's nopony else to talk to!"
Princess Celestia says: "Yet."
Princess Celestia says: "I can talk to ponies in their dreams!"
Princess Celestia says: "Now, to save some ponies from their nightmares."
Princess Celestia says: "Which aren't real, so it shouldn't be too hard, right?"
Princess Celestia says: "Right."
Princess Celestia says: "Good call, Celestia!"
Princess Celestia says: "And I'm talking to myself again."
Pancakes says: "I care."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Ugh!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "No!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is big!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Like, really big!"
Princess Celestia says: "Starlight!"
Princess Celestia says: "I'm here now."
Princess Celestia says: "Tell me what's wrong."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Going with my gut was the wrong call!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I was supposed to bring you two closer together!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "But I've only driven you apart!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "If you two can't see why you need each other, then—"
Starlight Glimmer says: "!"
Nightmare Moon says: "Then I am back!"
Princess Celestia says: "Don't worry, Starlight."
Princess Celestia says: "I know how to handle Nightmare Moon."
Daybreaker says: "Yes!"
Daybreaker says: "But can you handle..."
Daybreaker says: "me?!"
Daybreaker says: "!"
Princess Celestia says: "This can't be!"
Daybreaker says: "If Luna can turn into Nightmare Moon, you can absolutely turn into me—"
Daybreaker says: "Daybreaker!"
Daybreaker says: "The better, prettier, and more powerful version of you!"
Princess Celestia says: "No!"
Princess Celestia says: "I'll never turn into you!"
Daybreaker says: "Deep inside, you know how powerful you are."
Daybreaker says: "You don't need Luna."
Princess Celestia says: "That's not true!"
Princess Celestia says: "Even when we were apart, I knew I needed her!"
Daybreaker says: "Oh, please!"
Daybreaker says: "You don't need anypony!"
Daybreaker says: "You can do whatever you want."
Daybreaker says: "And all you have to do is get rid of anypony who stands in your way!"
Daybreaker says: "I never should've banished you to the moon!"
Daybreaker says: "I should've destroyed you!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "No, you can't do that!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Day, night, sun, moon—"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Equestria needs both of you!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Without balance, there's no harmony!"
Daybreaker says: "Who needs balance when you can have it all?!"
Daybreaker says: "!"
Daybreaker says: "Ugh!"
Nightmare Moon says: "You can't get rid of me so easily, sister!"
Nightmare Moon says: "Unless you plan on smiling me to smithereens!"
Princess Celestia says: "Enough!"
Daybreaker says: "I told you I was more powerful than you!"
Daybreaker says: "Ugh."
Daybreaker says: "So much black."
Daybreaker says: "We get it."
Daybreaker says: "You're sad."
Daybreaker says: "You could really use some..."
Daybreaker says: "sun!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "This is all my fault!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I never should've gone on this mission!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Now Equestria is doomed!"
Dream Ponies says: "That smile's too wide..."
Dream Ponies says: "It's obviously not real..."
Dream Pony says: "Why don't you want us to go on our field trip?"
Princess Luna says: "I don't..."
Princess Luna says: "!"
Princess Luna says: "I mean, I do!"
Dream Ponies says: "That smile's too wide..."
Dream Ponies says: "It's obviously not real..."
Princess Luna says: "Celestia!"
Princess Luna says: "I'm so glad you're..."
Princess Luna says: "!"
Princess Luna says: "I've seen a lot, but I haven't seen this before."
Princess Celestia says: "It's Starlight Glimmer's."
Princess Celestia says: "She's afraid this is what will happen if we continue to fight!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "What was I thinking?!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I'm never going with my gut again!"
Princess Luna says: "If you don't fix this soon, it could have a grave consequence on Starlight's psyche."
Princess Celestia says: "But my magic isn't powerful enough!"
Princess Celestia says: "I thought if we worked together..."
Princess Celestia says: "!"
Princess Luna says: "I have your magic, remember?"
Princess Luna says: "It doesn't work in the dream realm."
Princess Luna says: "It has to be you!"
Princess Celestia says: "Oh, Luna, I can't do this!"
Princess Celestia says: "I was wrong!"
Princess Celestia says: "Your job is so incredibly hard!"
Princess Celestia says: "You have to battle nightmares and work in the darkness and do it all alone!"
Princess Celestia says: "It takes such a brave, strong pony to do what you do!"
Princess Luna says: "And that pony is you."
Princess Luna says: "I walked a day in your shoes."
Princess Luna says: "I thought all you had to do was smile and be adored all the time, but I was wrong."
Princess Luna says: "There is so much more to it than that."
Nightmare Moon says: "Ugh!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "Don't do this to each other!"
Princess Luna says: "In order to defeat Daybreaker, you need only to trust in your strength as I do."
Daybreaker says: "You can't destroy me!"
Daybreaker says: "I'm everything you want to be!"
Princess Celestia says: "No, you're not!"
Princess Celestia says: "You are not real, and you will never exist again!"
Princess Luna says: "You did it!"
Princess Celestia says: "Only because you were here."
Princess Celestia says: "I don't know how you do this alone."
Princess Luna says: "So, um, did you talk to yourself?"
Princess Celestia says: "Um, a little."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Is this really happening, or is this still a dream?"
Princess Luna says: "Welcome back, sister!"
Princess Luna says: "I know you had a long night, so I made you some pancakes!"
Princess Celestia says: "Oh!"
Princess Celestia says: "Heh."
Princess Celestia says: "H-How..."
Princess Celestia says: "eh, nice."
Princess Celestia says: "Ahem."
Princess Celestia says: "They're..."
Princess Celestia says: "delicious."
Princess Celestia says: "Heh."
Princess Celestia says: "Thank you."
Princess Luna says: "I know that face!"
Princess Luna says: "They're not."
Princess Luna says: "I know you have to be perfect for everypony else, and you do an amazing job."
Princess Luna says: "But you don't have to do it for me."
Princess Celestia says: "In that case, they are terrible!"
Princess Luna says: "I know!"
Princess Celestia says: "But it means a lot that you tried."
Princess Celestia says: "I love you, sister."
Princess Luna says: "I love you too."
Starlight Glimmer says: "So..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "this was real."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Or..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "was it not real, and this just happened now and-and not in my dream?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I'm so confused."
Princess Celestia says: "It's all real."
Princess Celestia says: "It was the right call going with your gut."
Princess Luna says: "The map was wise to send you, Starlight."
Princess Luna says: "Nopony else would have been so bold as to do what you did."
Starlight Glimmer says: "That's a nice way of saying I came dangerously close to messing everything up."
Princess Celestia says: "It was just what we needed."
Princess Celestia says: "The experience has made us closer than ever."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Wait."
Starlight Glimmer says: "I'm not doing this."
Princess Celestia says: "I believe that one means your mission is complete."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Wow!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I can't wait to tell Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I already know!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I mean, I don't know everything."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I just got here to bring you your toothbrush!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "So this is just a friendly visit!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not interfering because I was worried!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I wasn't!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I knew you could do it, and I'm so, so, so, so, so proud of you!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Tell me everything!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Start from after I hyperventilated, and don't leave out any details!"
Princess Luna says: "Oh, uh, by the way, there's a field trip you need to make happen and a – ahem – timberwolf issue you need to address."
Princess Celestia says: "W-What?"
Princess Luna says: "Oh!"
Princess Luna says: "Look!"
Princess Luna says: "There's the sun!"
Princess Luna says: "Time for me to turn in!"
