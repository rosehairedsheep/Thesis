Cozy Glow says: "Thank you for the mail delivery."
Cozy Glow says: "Have a wonderful day!"
Cozy Glow says: "You're new here, right?"
Cozy Glow says: "I'm Cozy Glow, Professor Sparkle's friendship assistant."
Cozy Glow says: "Welcome to our school!"
Cozy Glow says: "Your first class is just down that hall."
Cozy Glow says: "A seven-letter word for "teamwork"."
Cozy Glow says: "Have you tried "synergy"?"
Silverstream says: "That's it!"
Silverstream says: "Thanks, Cozy!"
Cozy Glow says: "What are friends for?"
Cozy Glow says: "Good morning, Professor Sparkle!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The mail's here already?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What time is it?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm late for my class's field trip to Cloudsdale!"
Cozy Glow says: "Don't worry."
Cozy Glow says: "I asked Professor Rainbow Dash to cover for you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And she said yes?"
Cozy Glow says: "Uh-huh."
Cozy Glow says: "I told her how busy you are and how much her loyalty meant to you."
Cozy Glow says: "I also color-coded your teaching schedule by friendship element and catalogued all the magical artifacts in the school."
Cozy Glow says: "I hope that's okay."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Cozy, that's amazing!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're like my right-hoof pony!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't know what I'd do without you."
Cozy Glow says: "It's like you taught me."
Cozy Glow says: "Helping is what friendship's all about."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Exactly."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And hopefully my class is learning that on their field trip right now."
Cozy Glow says: "I heard they might do some sightseeing first."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ta-da!"
Rainbow Dash says: "The Pegasus Weather Factory!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Every drop of rain or flake of snow from Cloudsdale comes from there."
Rainbow Dash says: "I know, right?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Hey!"
Rainbow Dash says: "The cool stuff's over here!"
Ocellus says: "Wow!"
Ocellus says: "I've never stood on a cloud before!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "You can't normally."
Starlight Glimmer says: "But for our trip, I cast a spell that lets us walk like Pegasi."
Gallus says: "Hey, Yona!"
Gallus says: "Come check out this view!"
Gallus says: "Unless you're too scared."
Yona says: "Now Yona scared!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Come on!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We gotta catch 'em!"
Gallus says: "Gotcha!"
Ocellus says: "It's okay, Yona!"
Ocellus says: "You like flying, remember?"
Yona says: "Flying, not falling!"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I don't understand."
Starlight Glimmer says: "It-It's like my spell stopped working."
Starlight Glimmer says: "That's..."
Starlight Glimmer says: "never happened before."
Starlight Glimmer says: "We have an emergency!"
Rainbow Dash says: "The students dropped out of the sky!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Slow down."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What happened?"
Starlight Glimmer says: "I cast a spell for our field trip to Cloudsdale, but my magic just failed."
Rainbow Dash says: "We barely caught everypony in time!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm glad you're all okay, but I'm sure it's nothing to worry about, Starlight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Maybe you did your spell wrong."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's take a look."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I didn't drop that book."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Maybe you did your spell wrong?"
Rarity says: "Ow!"
Fluttershy says: "Rarity ran into the door."
Rarity says: "My magic is go-o-o-one!"
Rarity says: "I even had to use my hooves to coif my tail!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Still think there's nothing to worry about?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "This doesn't make any sense."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Magic can't just disappear."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Something has to be causing this."
Cozy Glow says: "Um, didn't we learn in class about a creature that eats magic?"
Cozy Glow says: "Ter, Tee..."
Cozy Glow says: "Tir-something?"
Fluttershy says: "Tirek!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Isn't he trapped in Tartarus?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, what's wrong?"
Spike says: "Thanks."
Spike says: "I've never had a letter get stuck before."
Spike says: "It's from Princess Celestia!"
Spike says: "We've all been called to an emergency meeting in Canterlot!"
Spike says: "Look!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pretty sure I know what it's about."
Princess Celestia says: "Throughout our city, ponies have been reporting tales of their magic failing."
Princess Celestia says: "Spells going wrong."
Princess Celestia says: "Potions not working."
Princess Luna says: "Even raising the moon has become difficult."
Princess Luna says: "Are there similar troubles in Ponyville?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We experienced it first-hoof."
Princess Cadance says: "It's the same in my kingdom."
Princess Cadance says: "The Crystal Heart seems safe for now, but I worry if this continues."
"Special Delivery" says: "Letter for the princess from Star Swirl the Bearded!"
Princess Celestia says: "Ah!"
Princess Celestia says: "It is even more terrible than we feared!"
Princess Celestia says: "Magic is disappearing all across Equestria!"
Princess Celestia says: "Star Swirl believes the power will drain from our land in three days."
Princess Celestia says: "First, unicorn magic and spells will fail."
Starlight Glimmer says: "That's what's happening now."
Princess Celestia says: "On the second day, creatures will lose their magic abilities."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, no!"
Princess Celestia says: "And finally, magical artifacts will stop working."
Princess Celestia says: "When the sun sets on the third day, the magic in our world will be gone forever!"
Princess Cadance says: "But why is this happening now?"
Princess Luna says: "That's the worst part."
Princess Luna says: "We have no idea."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Has anypony checked on Tirek?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You mean the big, red, scary centaur who eats magic?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Why would we wa—"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ohhhh."
Pinkie Pie says: "Riiiiight."
Princess Celestia says: "If he has found some way to escape his prison or work from within it, he could be responsible for this."
Princess Luna says: "That is the best explanation so far."
Princess Luna says: "Somepony should investigate."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We'll go."
Rarity says: "Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no."
Rarity says: "Not without us, you wo—"
Rarity says: "Wait."
Rarity says: "Did you say "we"?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've finally learned that it's okay to count on your friends for help."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Um, you do want to come, right?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, duh!"
Princess Celestia says: "Thank you, all."
Princess Celestia says: "We will search for ways to protect Equestria in your absence."
Princess Luna says: "Be careful."
Princess Luna says: "Tartarus has changed since you were there."
Princess Luna says: "It now holds many dangerous creatures, and you won't be able to rely on your magic."
Applejack says: "With her friends by her side, she won't have to."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I left you my lesson plan, all my student files, and my annotated syllabus notes."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If anything goes wrong, get Celestia."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Got it!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Maybe I should just close the school and send my students home."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Would you go save Equestria already?"
Spike says: "Okay."
Spike says: "Cozy packed us all up for a trip to bad guy central."
Cozy Glow says: "Don't forget the sandwiches."
Cozy Glow says: "I marked whose is whose, just in case."
Cozy Glow says: "Starlight can't stand mustard."
Starlight Glimmer says: "That's so sweet of you, Cozy."
Starlight Glimmer says: "But Twilight has asked me to stay here to run the school."
Cozy Glow says: "Oh."
Cozy Glow says: "I thought that after what happened last time—"
Spike says: "Once she's survived Discord, anything else is a piece of cake."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Plus, she'll have you to help her."
Cozy Glow says: "Oh, golly, yes!"
Cozy Glow says: "I promise I'll be the best assistant ever!"
Cozy Glow says: "Come on."
Cozy Glow says: "We can start working on your substitute headmare plans right now, if you like."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Wow."
Starlight Glimmer says: "Uh, okay."
Twilight Sparkle says: "See?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Nothing to worry about."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Tell me there's nothing to worry about."
Cozy Glow says: "Good morning, friendship students!"
Cozy Glow says: "I know we're all sad Professor Sparkle is away."
Cozy Glow says: "But don't worry, because she left me in charge to do things just the way she would."
Gallus says: "Uh, I thought Starlight Glimmer was gonna be temporary headmare."
Cozy Glow says: "She was, but she left me this note."
Cozy Glow says: "Isn't that sweet?"
Cozy Glow says: "We won't let Starlight down, will we?"
Smolder says: "It's just kind of weird, isn't it?"
Cozy Glow says: "I don't know what you mean."
Smolder says: "Like, why'd she change her mind?"
Smolder says: "Why did Starlight write a note instead of saying goodbye to us herself?"
Smolder says: "Doesn't make any sense."
Cozy Glow says: "Oh, Smolder, you forget."
Cozy Glow says: "We're not scheming dragons."
Cozy Glow says: "We're ponies."
Cozy Glow says: "Sounds like somecreature needs to do a little extra friendship homework."
Yona says: "Yak not pony either!"
Yona says: "If Smolder get homework, Yona get homework."
Ocellus says: "Me, too!"
Sandbar says: "I'm in!"
Silverstream says: "Yeah!"
Silverstream says: "Homework party!"
Gallus says: "Fine."
Cozy Glow says: "What loyalty."
Cozy Glow says: "Professor Rainbow Dash would be so proud."
Cozy Glow says: "You are such good friends."
Cozy Glow says: "You all are."
Cozy Glow says: "And I'm grateful because it will be awfully hard running a whole school alone."
Cozy Glow says: "Can I count on each of you to help me?"
Cozy Glow says: "Thank you so much!"
Cozy Glow says: "It's just like our professors taught us."
Cozy Glow says: "Together, we can get through anything!"
Fly-ders buzzing.
Rarity says: "Ow!"
Rarity says: "Ugh!"
Rarity says: "I have had it with these horrible flies!"
Rarity says: "I miss my magic!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Have you tried using your tail to shoo them away?"
Rarity says: "Bite your tongue!"
Rarity says: "It's for decorative purposes only!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I didn't know we packed green cupcakes."
Fluttershy says: "Um, we didn't."
Fluttershy says: "They must've gone bad without magic to keep them cold."
Rainbow Dash says: ""Magic" this, "magic" that."
Rainbow Dash says: "We don't need magic to go on a little hike."
Rarity says: "You were saying?"
Applejack says: "You just need to think more like Earth ponies, y'all."
Applejack says: "Granny's "Apple Core No-Bite-No-More"!"
Applejack says: "That'll keep the flies off."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ugh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It smells just like it looks!"
Fluttershy says: "Even if our food's spoiled, these blueberries are still good to eat."
Spike says: "Too bad we can't do anything about the rainstorm."
Rainbow Dash says: "I can't stop that storm by myself, but I can still help!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I think we have all the magic we need right here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not that I don't want to get it back."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Heh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's go!"
"Citrine Spark" says: "Cozy Glow baked our class cupcakes today!"
"Berry Bliss" says: "And she made all of us friendship bracelets!"
"Patty Peppermint" says: "She's the nicest pony I've ever met."
"Patty Peppermint" says: "I'm so glad she's headmare!"
Sandbar says: "Uh, temporary headmare?"
Sandbar says: "Right, guys?"
"Citrine Spark" says: "Oh, oh, of course."
"Citrine Spark" says: "But if Twilight takes her time coming back, I won't mind."
Silverstream says: "Finally!"
Silverstream says: "We thought you forgot about study club."
Sandbar says: "Sorry I'm late."
Sandbar says: "Cozy Glow gave our class tickets to a Sapphire Shores concert in Ponyville tonight."
Gallus says: "You get the feeling Cozy's trying too hard to make us like her?"
Ocellus says: "Or maybe she just wants to help us keep our minds off of how scary it is that magic's disappearing."
Smolder says: "I don't trust her."
Smolder says: "What's she up to behind those big eyes and bouncy curls?"
Yona says: "And why Cozy pony coming out catacombs so late at night?"
Gallus says: "Let's go ask her."
Twilight Sparkle says: "This is the only door to Tartarus."
Twilight Sparkle says: "The good news is the seal isn't broken, so we know Tirek didn't escape."
Applejack says: "Let me guess."
Applejack says: "You got bad news, too?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Last time I was here, I had to use magic to get in."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And according to Star Swirl, all unicorn magic was gone by yesterday's sunset."
Rainbow Dash says: "Maybe he was wrong."
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't worry, Twilight."
Pinkie Pie says: "I got this."
Pinkie Pie says: "Free pizza delivery!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Huh."
Pinkie Pie says: "Always worked before."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, well."
Applejack says: "Did any of y'all pack somethin' that could actually help?"
Rarity says: "These all do magic, but not the kind we're looking for, I'm afraid."
Spike says: "How about this?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "The Key of Unfettered Entrance!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where did you find this, Spike?"
Spike says: "In your bag."
Spike says: "Cozy Glow must've packed it for you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "She really did think of everything."
Fluttershy says: "Um, what does it do?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "It can magically open any door."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And since artifacts like this haven't lost their power yet..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I guess it only works once."
Applejack says: "Cockatrice!"
Rarity says: "Do something, Fluttershy!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Don't look at it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "It'll turn you to stone!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I don't feel like stone."
Pinkie Pie says: "Unless it's really bouncy stone."
Fluttershy says: "I think he lost his magic, too."
Fluttershy says: "All the creatures here must have."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Star Swirl said that would happen on the second day."
Spike says: "I know it should make me feel safer, but it just makes me sad."
Spike says: "We gotta fix this!"
Chancellor Neighsay says: "Where is Princess Twilight?!"
Chancellor Neighsay says: "!"
Cozy Glow says: "Oh, golly."
Cozy Glow says: "She's away on a quest."
Cozy Glow says: "I'm watching the school for her."
Chancellor Neighsay says: "Magic is failing across our land, and she left a foal in charge of this facility?"
Cozy Glow says: "Yes, sir!"
Cozy Glow says: "Is there anything I can do for you?"
Chancellor Neighsay says: "That won't be necessary."
Chancellor Neighsay says: "Twilight's folly stops here."
Chancellor Neighsay says: "As of now, I am headstallion."
Chancellor Neighsay says: "And I have quite a few changes to make."
Pinkie Pie says: "If all these monsters lost their magic, then getting past Cerberus should be easy-peasy!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Look out!"
Fluttershy says: "I'll talk to him."
Fluttershy says: "Um, excuse me, puppy?"
Fluttershy says: "You're a very good guard dog."
Fluttershy says: "Yes, you are."
Fluttershy says: "But, um, we were wondering if we could get by to check on Tirek."
Applejack says: "That looks like a yes."
Rarity says: "I'll get you a towel, darling."
Lord Tirek says: "The Princess of Friendship here for a visit."
Lord Tirek says: "What have I done to earn the honor of your company?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We want answers, Tirek."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Magic is disappearing from Equestria."
Lord Tirek says: "I know."
Lord Tirek says: "What a waste of such..."
Lord Tirek says: "..."
Lord Tirek says: "mmmm, delicious power."
Rainbow Dash says: "So you are behind this!"
Lord Tirek says: "Silly filly, if I had all of that magic, you think I'd still be locked up in here?"
Lord Tirek says: "But I might know something about it..."
Cozy Glow says: "What are you doing?!"
Cozy Glow says: "!"
Cozy Glow says: "Those are Twilight's student files!"
Chancellor Neighsay says: "These aren't."
Chancellor Neighsay says: "Not anymore."
Chancellor Neighsay says: "With Equestria under attack, ponies must stand together."
Chancellor Neighsay says: "Twilight has endangered us all by skipping off on friendship trips while these dangerous creatures run loose."
Cozy Glow says: "You don't think they're the reason magic is disappearing, do you?"
Chancellor Neighsay says: "Yes, and I came to warn Twilight."
Chancellor Neighsay says: "But since she is gone, it falls to me to protect you foals from these monsters."
Chancellor Neighsay says: "Did you hear something?"
Cozy Glow says: "It sounded like it came from over there!"
Chancellor Neighsay says: "You again."
Chancellor Neighsay says: "As I suspected."
Chancellor Neighsay says: "From now on, this school is pony-only!"
Chancellor Neighsay says: "As nature intended."
Chancellor Neighsay says: "Since you refuse to explain your plot against Equestria and return the magic you stole, you will stay here while I summon your guardians to take you home."
Sandbar says: "Wait!"
Sandbar says: "You were right about them from the beginning, Chancellor."
Sandbar says: "I see that now."
Smolder says: "What are you saying?!"
Smolder says: "!"
Silverstream says: "Sandbar?!"
Silverstream says: "!"
Sandbar says: "I don't want anything to do with creatures that could threaten Equestria!"
Chancellor Neighsay says: "Wisely put, colt."
Chancellor Neighsay says: "Everypony will come to their senses eventually."
Apple Bloom says: "What in tarnation?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Sandbar says: "Sorry."
Sandbar says: "I ran out of apples."
Sandbar says: "I need the Cutie Mark Crusaders."
Sandbar says: "My friends are in trouble."
Sandbar says: "Chancellor Neighsay locked them up."
Apple Bloom says: "Huh?"
Apple Bloom says: "I thought Cozy Glow was in charge."
Sandbar says: "Not anymore."
Sandbar says: "But you guys are good buddies."
Sandbar says: "If you can convince her to distract Neighsay, I can break out my friends."
Sandbar says: "Will you help me?"
Apple Bloom says: "Do mulberries have seeds?"
Apple Bloom says: "That's a yes."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Where is Equestria's magic going, Tirek?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What's making it disappear?"
Lord Tirek says: "If you let me out, I'm sure it will jog my memory."
Lord Tirek says: "What do you say?"
Lord Tirek says: "I scratch your back, you scratch mine?"
Rainbow Dash says: "How about you tell us what you know or you'll be stuck here forever, because we're out of magic keys and nopony can open the door?"
Rarity says: "Oh, dear."
Rarity says: "I hadn't thought of that."
Spike says: "We're just as trapped as Tirek?"
Lord Tirek says: "What a pity."
Lord Tirek says: "Well, for you."
Lord Tirek says: "Sweet revenge for me."
Lord Tirek says: "It seems my little protégé's plan worked after all."
Applejack says: "Which little protégé?"
Lord Tirek says: "Oh, we've never met."
Lord Tirek says: "We're pen pals."
Lord Tirek says: "Each letter had so many questions about draining magic."
Pinkie Pie says: "And you answered them?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Lord Tirek says: "I was bored."
Lord Tirek says: "So I simply pointed my pen pal in the right direction."
Fluttershy says: "Can't you just tell us your pen pal's name?"
Fluttershy says: "I mean, since we're stuck here anyway?"
Lord Tirek says: "Oh, why not?"
Lord Tirek says: "The irony is too perfect."
Lord Tirek says: "Her name is..."
Sandbar says: "Cozy Glow!"
Sandbar says: "I-I could've sworn I saw her come down this way when she left her office."
Cozy Glow says: "Enjoying yourself in there, Starlight?"
Cozy Glow says: "I'm sorry I had to push you in."
Cozy Glow says: "But what else could I do?"
Cozy Glow says: "You were going to ruin all my plans."
Cozy Glow says: "You might get some company soon, if I can't make that annoying Neighsay back off!"
