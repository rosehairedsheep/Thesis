Nurse Redheart says: "Shhh!"
Applejack says: "Now how in thunderation is one of them twins a Pegasus and the other one a unicorn?"
Mr. Cake says: "Easy."
Mr. Cake says: "My great-great-great-great grandfather was a unicorn, and Cup Cake's great aunt's second cousin twice removed was a Pegasus."
Mr. Cake says: "That makes sense, right?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Aw, yeah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh, just you wait!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Once little Pound Cake there gets his wings going, he'll be all over the place."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And be careful around Pumpkin Cake."
Rarity says: "Baby unicorns get strange magic surges that come and go."
Pinkie Pie says: "Quick!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Make a wish and blow out your candles!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Which is easy, 'cause there are zero candles!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You are zero years old, after all!"
Nurse Redheart says: "Shhh!"
Pinkie Pie.

Mrs. Cake says: "Uh uh uh, Pound Cake, no pounding things."
Mr. Cake says: "Uh uh uh uh, we don't chew on things, Pumpkin Cake."
Pinkie Pie says: "Except food."
Mrs. Cake says: "Food!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Great cinnamon sticks, I completely forgot."
Pinkie Pie says: "No, you just fed them bottles, remember?"
Mrs. Cake says: "Not the babies' food!"
Mr. Cake says: "Gh!"
Mr. Cake says: "The food for the enormously big catering order we have to deliver today!"
Mrs. Cake says: "Oh, with the new twins, we've been so distracted!"
Mr. Cake says: "Gh, quick, honeybun, we need to find a babysitter to watch the foals while we take care of this."
Pinkie Pie says: "I could do it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I wanna do it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, the babies love playing with me, I'll do it!"
Mrs. Cake says: "I wonder who would be available on such short notice."
Pinkie Pie says: "Me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pick me!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, I would love to babysit!"
Fluttershy says: "But I can't today, sorry."
Fluttershy says: "I promised Angel we'd go on a picnic."
Fluttershy says: "You understand, don't you?"
Fluttershy says: "Y-you're not mad at me, are you?"
Fluttershy says: "Please don't be mad at me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'll do it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pick me!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I have to finish this report for the Princess summarizing all my other reports to the Princess."
Pinkie Pie says: "I wanna babysit!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pick me!"
Applejack says: "Babysit?"
Applejack says: "Now?"

Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh, ooh, I wanna do it!"

Rarity says: "Moi?"
Rarity says: "Babysit?"
Rarity says: "N- Oh nonononononononono!"
Rarity says: "I'm flattered that you would think about me though."
Mr. Cake says: "Pinkie Pie, how would you like to babysit for us?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I dunno."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'll have to check my schedule."
Mr. Cake says: "Now, Pinkie, are you sure you really understand the responsibility of watching over two babies?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I can be responsible."
Pinkie Pie says: "Why, responsibility is my middle name."
Pinkie Pie says: "Pinkie Responsibility Pie."
Mrs. Cake says: "But this time you need to take care of them, not just play with them."
Mrs. Cake says: "You have to be responsible."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yes, I know."

Pinkie Pie says: "I am."
Mrs. Cake says: "Oh, here you are, dearie."

Pinkie Pie says: "Look, look!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Where's Pinkie Pie..."
Pinkie Pie says: "?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Where's Pinkie Pie?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh no..."

Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, think think think..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Aha!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey guys, watch this!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hey, you're a wonderful crowd here tonight!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Where y'all from?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wow, that's great."
Pinkie Pie says: "Y'know, I used to have an ant farm, but I had to get rid of it because..."
Pinkie Pie says: "I couldn't find tractors that small!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Get it?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Tractors that small?"
Pinkie Pie says: "The other day, I spilled spot remover on my dog..."
Pinkie Pie says: "and now I can't find him!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Gee, tough crowd."
Pinkie Pie says: "Tell me about it."
Pinkie Pie says: "Fine, I wasn't gonna pull off a show stopper, but you're a lovely audience and I think you deserve it!"
First you jiggle your tail! Oink oink oink!
Then you wriggle your snout! Oink oink oink!
Then you wiggle your rump! Oink oink oink!
Then shout it out! Oink oink oink!

Pinkie Pie says: "There, see?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Nothing to this babysitting business!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ugh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Snack time."
Pinkie Pie says: "That's easy enough."
Pinkie Pie says: "Okie-dokie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Eat up!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Like this!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Num-num-num, num-num-num-num!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ahh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No, Pumpkin Cake, we eat food, not tablecloths."
Pinkie Pie says: "Huh, huh?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, hey, guys, look at me!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Achoo!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah."
Pinkie Pie says: "I think I can see where this is going."
Pinkie Pie says: "Towels are not food, Pumpkin Cake!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Drop it..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Drop it..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Drop it!"

Pinkie Pie says: "Look, look, uh, floating things!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ooh, aaah, eeh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, don't make me do it, guys!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You know what happens when you mix flour and water, don't you?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Easy..."
Pinkie Pie says: "easy..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, you've gotta be kidding me."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Thank goodness they're home!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hi!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I finished up the work I had to do, so I thought I'd stop by and see if you needed any help."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Whoa!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I can't begin to tell you what my day has been like!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I mean, these babies just won't listen to reason, and don't even get me started on their taste in stand-up comedy."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It's okay, Pinkie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I figured you would need some help."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's why I stopped by."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ex-cuse me?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Babies take a lot of work, and some ponies are just not cut out to handle the responsibility."
Pinkie Pie says: "Is that so?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, thanks for stopping by, Twilight."
Pinkie Pie says: "Sorry, I don't have time to visit."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm very very busy with my responsibilities here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm happy to help!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, of all the– She thinks I can't handle things on my own!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Maybe because I haven't handled things on my own."
Pinkie Pie says: "Well, I can handle things on my own!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pound Cake."
Pinkie Pie says: "This is a crib."
Pinkie Pie says: "It is only to be used for napping, sleeping, and on occasion with permission, as a pretend old-timey Western fort."
Pinkie Pie says: "It is not a trampoline, so stop your jumping right now, mister!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And you, young filly."
Pinkie Pie says: "We do not put anything in our mouth that we cannot safely and properly digest, so stop slobbering on that toy this instant!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Now, we've all had a very exhausting afternoon, and it's time for all good little foals to take their nap."
Pinkie Pie says: "So, fall asleep!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Sleep tight."
Pinkie Pie says: "Now that's what I call handling things."
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, nononono."
Pinkie Pie says: "Not good, not good, not good!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pound?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pumpkin?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Where are you?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoa!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You be a good little girl now, Pumpkin-wumpkin, and stay in your crib for your pal Pinkie-winkie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Pound Cake?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Here, Pound Cake!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh, Pound Cake?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Uh..."
Psycho chords play.
Pinkie Pie says: "You can fly?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh..."
Pinkie Pie says: "get down here..."
Pinkie Pie says: "this instant..."
Pinkie Pie says: "young..."
Pinkie Pie says: "colt!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm responsible for you!"
Pumpkin Cake says: "Nom nom nom."
Pinkie Pie says: "No no no, Pumpkin."
Pumpkin Cake says: "Nom nom."
Pinkie Pie says: "No no."
Pumpkin Cake says: "Nom."
Pinkie Pie says: "No."
Pinkie Pie says: "Hmph!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I am the responsible one, and I said no."
Pound Cake says: "Wheeee!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That goes for you too, Pound Cake!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Gotcha!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I think?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Mm, razzleberry."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm- not- letting- go!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm- re-spon-si-ble!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh, not you too!"
Pinkie Pie says: "There!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Now who's the responsible one?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Y'know, you're right."
Pinkie Pie says: "That is funny."
I've always had fun playing with little kids, and I thought babysitting meant just more playtime, right? Wrong! Being a caregiver is way more responsibility than just being a playmate. And today, I learned that sometimes our desire for responsibility can outrun our actual ability to handle it.
Mr. Cake says: "Pinkie Pie!"
Mr. Cake says: "We're back!"
Mrs. Cake says: "How did everything go?"
Mr. Cake says: "Are we in the right place?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Shhh!"

Mrs. Cake says: "This is just..."
Mrs. Cake says: "just..."
Mr. Cake says: "Amazing is what it is."
Mr. Cake says: "We had no idea how responsible you really are."
Mr. Cake says: "Would you be interested in becoming our go-to babysitter on a permanent basis?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Hm- Ah- lemme check my schedule!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I should be available a week from..."
Pinkie Pie says: "never!"
Pound Cake says: "Pinkie..."
Pumpkin Cake says: "Pie..."
Pinkie Pie says: "I have some free time next Tuesday."
