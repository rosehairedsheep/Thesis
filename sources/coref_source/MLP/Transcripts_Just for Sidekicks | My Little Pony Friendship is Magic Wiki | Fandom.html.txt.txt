Spike says: "Me, that's who."
Spike says: "Who are you hooing at?"
Spike says: "I know, they're delicious."
Spike says: "Now you see 'em, now you don't."
Spike says: "I had a bowl full of them here, and now I don't!"
Spike says: "Which means somebody took 'em!"
Spike says: "Who?"
Spike says: "That's what I'm asking, who?!"
Spike says: "!"
Spike says: "Who took my jewels?!"
Spike says: "!"
Spike says: "Oh."
Spike says: "I'm who."
Spike says: "This cake was gonna be so good!"
Spike says: "Why?"
Spike says: "Whyyyyyyyyy???!!!"
Spike says: "!!!"
Spike says: "I have no jewels..."
Spike says: "I have no cake..."
Spike says: "I'm a sad little dragon..."
Spike says: "..."
Spike says: "is it?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh goodness, I-I hope I'm not interrupting anything."
Spike says: "Well..."
Spike says: "I do have this cake to not bake..."
Fluttershy says: "Oh..."
Fluttershy says: "sorry, it's a bad time."
Spike says: "Uh, inside joke."
Spike says: "Talk to me."
Fluttershy says: "It's just that..."
Spike says: "Oh, I know all about that."
Spike says: "As if I wouldn't be any help at welcoming..."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, I don't know what was I thinking."
Fluttershy says: "Of course you might be upset for not being invited, and..."
Fluttershy says: "here I am coming to ask you for a favor."
Fluttershy says: "You were probably going to say no anyway."
Fluttershy says: "All I had to offer you in exchange was one little jewel."
Spike says: "What was that?"
Fluttershy says: "All I have is this jewel."
Spike says: "That's a really big one."
Spike says: "A really big, juicy, perfect-for-a-cake-topper jewel."
Fluttershy says: "Does this mean you'll do it?"
Spike says: "Yeah..."
Spike says: "Sure..."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, thank you, thank you!"
Fluttershy says: "So while I'm gone, you'll take care of Angel, and tomorrow is Tuesday, which is his tail-fluffing day, and it's really important for him to look good."
Spike says: "Wait, what?"
Spike says: "You want me to take care of him?"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, well, yes."
Fluttershy says: "But if it's too much trouble, I can always see if there is somepony else."
Spike says: "Uhh..."
Spike says: "We already agreed on the whole jewel thing, so I'll just..."
Fluttershy says: "Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
Fluttershy says: "Angel, aren't you just so excited?"
Fluttershy says: "See you tomorrow."
Spike says: "You know..."
Spike says: "She's not the only pony with a pet that might need some watching..."
Spike says: "All I'm saying is, if Fluttershy thought that her beloved little friend shouldn't be left alone while you're busy in the Crystal Empire, then maybe that's just something to think about."
Rainbow Dash says: "Tch!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Tank's not some fuzzy little bunny."
Rainbow Dash says: "He can take care of himself."
Rainbow Dash says: "He's a strong, fearless, and totally together pet."
Rainbow Dash says: "Alright."
Rainbow Dash says: "You can watch him, but only because..."
Rainbow Dash says: "uh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Tank's got a strict flying regimen, and-and someone needs to make sure that he doesn't slack off while I'm gone."
Rarity says: "Ohh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "You know..."
Rainbow Dash says: "the two of us are very diligent."
Spike says: "Okay, whatever."
Rarity says: "Yes, yes, more importantly, as for Opal, she likes to eat every thirty six and a half minutes, you groom her with her silken brush, head to toe..."
Rarity says: "..."
Rarity says: "Oh, and don't forget to pooch her pillow out in the middle, that's where she likes it."
Rarity says: "And the temperature in the room should always be exactly eighty one point four degrees."
Rarity says: "That's the only way she can get to sleep."
Rarity says: "And, um..."
Rarity says: "hmm..."
Rarity says: "oh, good, so thanks for your help and good luck to you."
Rainbow Dash says: "A-hem..."
Rainbow Dash says: "I think the dragon was expecting a little something for his efforts."
Spike says: "Almost as beautiful as the pony who gave it to me..."
Rainbow Dash says: "Shouldn't you be critter-proofing the library or something?"
Spike says: "Critter-proofing."
Spike says: "Yeah, I'll get right on that."
Spike says: "Three down, three to go."
Spike says: "What's that you said, Gummy?"
Spike says: "Uh-huh."
Spike says: "Well, you're just gonna have to ask Pinkie Pie about that one."
Pinkie Pie says: "Ask me, ask me!"
Spike says: "Go ahead, ask her!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Of course you can have another cupcake!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Mm?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Mm-hm?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yeah?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Why didn't you say so?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'll get you a bigger pond immediately."
Pinkie Pie says: "He's always wanted a pair of riding pants?"
Pinkie Pie says: "His toenails need a new coat of shellac?"
Pinkie Pie says: "He wants to floss twice a day instead of just once?"
Spike says: "I think what Gummy's trying to say is that he'd like a little Spike time."
Pinkie Pie says: "Who wouldn't?!"
Pinkie Pie says: "!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Spike time is the best!"
Spike says: "Alas, it doesn't come cheap."
Rainbow Dash says: "All I'm saying is you might wanna think about a helmet."
Rainbow Dash says: "You only want to get hit in the head by a flying turtle..."
Rainbow Dash says: "once."
Spike says: "A thousand plus carats of pure deliciousness..."
Applejack says: "Looks like you got a regular pet day care in here, Spike."
Applejack says: "You'll still be able to get some good play time with Winona like you said though, won't ya?"
Applejack says: "She tends to get a little wild if she doesn't get her exercise."
Spike says: "Exercise."
Spike says: "Sure, of course."
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't remember seeing critters on the invite list."
Applejack says: "That's 'cause we're leavin' them here with Spike."
Applejack says: "He's gonna do a little critter-sittin' for us."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, really?"
Fluttershy says: "So sorry I'm late."
Fluttershy says: "Silly bunny had hidden his brush."
Fluttershy says: "Be sure you get plenty on his tail, or it won't get as poofy as he likes it."
Applejack says: "Come on, girls, or we're gonna miss the train."
Applejack says: "One more for the road?"
Applejack says: "Oh, you little puppy-wuppy, come on here!"
Pinkie Pie says: "No, no no no."
Pinkie Pie says: "I love you more."
Pinkie Pie says: "No, I love you more!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I love you more!!!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh, I promise it'll be okay."
Fluttershy says: "I'll fluff your tail twice next week."
Fluttershy says: "Three times?"
Rarity says: "Oh, I know."
Rarity says: "It's a chilly eighty one point two in here."
Rarity says: "Spike, take care of this, would you please?"
Spike says: "You got it!"
Spike says: "So, uhh..."
Spike says: "What are you thinking about that hooting little friend of yours?"
Spike says: "Suppose you want me to keep an eye on him too."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That would be nice."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You sure you don't already have your hands full?"
Spike says: "Nah, pshaw."
Spike says: "I'll be fine."
Spike says: "But, uh, just between you and me, I gotta give priority to the..."
Spike says: "paying customers."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You absolutely sure you can do this?"
Spike says: "Of course."
Spike says: "Wouldn't have agreed to it if I couldn't."
Spike says: "Piece of cake."
Spike says: "Speaking of cake, I got a little something I need to attend to."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yeah, like keeping an eye on a house full of critters."
Spike says: "Uh, yeah, uh, that was totally what I was talking about."
Spike says: "Relax."
Spike says: "Go to your welcoming thing in the Crystal Empire."
Spike says: "Spike's got it all under control."
Spike says: "Alright, sidekicks, front and center!"
Spike says: "There are six of you, but there's only one right here in front of me..."
Spike says: "Gah!"
Spike says: "Two!"
Spike says: "And what I say goes!"
Spike says: "Spike, the boss of you, that's who."
Spike says: "One, two, three!"
Spike says: "Nngh, come on, number four!"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "Guh..."
Spike says: "One, two, three, four, five..."
Spike says: "Argh, who's missing?"
Spike says: "Angel."
Spike says: "All I wanted were some jewels."
Spike says: "Big, juicy, delicious jewels."
Spike says: "Now what do I have?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Awww, little fluffy Angel Bunny-kins!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You're so cute!"
Sweetie Belle says: "The natural weaves in his fluff are to die for!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Isn't Angel just the cutest thing you've ever seen?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
Spike says: "Y'know, I'm supposed to be watching him, but you all have just hit it off so well that maybe, maybe I could let you take care of him instead."
Apple Bloom says: "We would, but we've got some major Crusaders business planned for today!"
Scootaloo says: "Major."
Scootaloo says: "We're getting our skydiving cutie marks today!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Ha!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Yeah!"
Spike says: "Well, I suppose, if you've got other plans..."
Spike says: "It's just, you're so good with them."
Spike says: "Like get-a-cutie-mark-for-bunny-sitting good?"
Apple Bloom says: "A bunny-sittin' cutie mark..."
Sweetie Belle says: "That would be adorable!"
Scootaloo says: "He does seem to like us."
Apple Bloom says: "And we haven't exactly figured out how we're gonna pull off this whole skydivin' thing."
Spike says: "You know what?"
Spike says: "As hard as it's gonna be for me part with these little guys, I think you should probably just take all of them."
Spike says: "If you ask me, nngh, the more critters you take care of, the more chances you have of getting some kind of critter-sitting cutie mark."
Spike says: "Am I right or am I right?"
Apple Bloom says: "Sure!"
Spike says: "Yes!"
Apple Bloom says: "But wait!"
Apple Bloom says: "How're we gonna take good care of them without treats for when they're good?"
Sweetie Belle says: "And we'll need beds for when they're tired!"
Scootaloo says: "And toys!"
Scootaloo says: "They need toys!"
Spike says: "It's an afternoon."
Spike says: "They don't need all that stuff."
Spike says: "They'll be fine."
Apple Bloom says: "We need to be able to buy them some things!"
Apple Bloom says: "One jewel might be able to cover it all."
Spike says: "Uh..."
Spike says: "what would I possibly be doing with jewels?"
Apple Bloom says: "I happen to know for a fact that Applejack gave you a gem to watch Winona, which means..."
Spike says: "Obviously, no one around here is getting a cutie mark for kindness toward a poor, hungry little dragon."
Spike says: "Take it or leave it."
Apple Bloom says: "We'll take it."
Spike says: "Gonna put in some flour, and add a little sugar for my five de-li-cious jewels!"
Sweetie Belle says: "But pink feathers would look so good with your eyes!"
Spike says: "Meh..."
Spike says: "that bird could use a little color."
Scootaloo says: "Has anyone seen Tank's head?"
Scootaloo says: "Where's his head?!"
Scootaloo says: "!"
Spike says: "What have you done to the turtle?!"
Spike says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "Ohh, I totally forgot he could do that."
Scootaloo says: "Heh."
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah, so, pretty sure critter-sittin' cutie marks are out."
Sweetie Belle says: "And our critter-grooming cutie marks probably aren't going to appear anytime soon either."
Spike says: "Alright, load 'em up."
Spike says: "And you can gimme back that jewel I gave you."
Apple Bloom says: "Sorry, we don't have it anymore."
Spike says: "What?"
Spike says: "Why not?!"
Spike says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "How do you think we paid for the industrial-sized pet hair dryer?"
Spike says: "Oh."
Zecora says: "Zecora knows just what to do about all this bad mojo that's floating around you."
Spike says: "I'm thinking a cage and a great big lock might be next."
Zecora says: "Zecora can take the bad away if you do just what I say."
Spike says: "Really?"
Zecora says: "But before I can do my duty, I am going to need some of your booty."
Spike says: "Where are you going?"
Zecora says: "You think jewels are what you need, but there's no worse mojo than dragon greed."
Spike says: "Almost there..."
Granny Smith says: "Mm-hm..."
Spike says: "Just taking good care of everyone's animals."
Spike says: "What am I gonna have to do to get this to go away?"
Spike says: "And this is just between you and me, right?"
Spike says: "No other pony has to hear a word about it?"
Granny Smith says: "A word about what now?"
Spike says: "This better be important."
Conductor says: "All aboard!"
Spike says: "Angel."
Conductor says: "I can't have all of these animals on my train."
Conductor says: "Not without tickets and not without chaperones."
Spike says: "All I need is to get on for one minute, grab a bunny, and get off!"
Spike says: "Promise!"
Conductor says: "Likely story."
Conductor says: "No chaperone, no train."
Scootaloo says: "Skydiving cutie marks!"
Spike says: "Is three ponies enough?"
Spike says: "At least I have you two left, my delectable little treasures."
Conductor says: "All aboard for the Crystal Empire!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "Crystal Empire?!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "I've always wanted to see the Crystal Empire!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I wish I were dressed for it, but still..."
Sweetie Belle says: "THE CRYSTAL EMPIRE!"
Spike says: "We're not really going!"
Spike says: "We just needed to get on the train so I can get that rabbit!"
Spike says: "And when I do, we're off!"
Scootaloo says: "What?!"
Scootaloo says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "That's not fair!"
Spike says: "There he is!"
Conductor says: "Next stop, the Crystal Empire!"
Spike says: "No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Apple Bloom says: "So it seems like the Crystal Empire would be really cold, but I've heard that it's not!"
Apple Bloom says: "It's as warm as can be!"
Scootaloo says: "Do you think the walls are crystal?"
Scootaloo says: "Maybe even see-through!"
Scootaloo says: "Can you imagine see-through walls?"
Spike says: "Take it!"
Spike says: "Just take it!"
Scootaloo says: "So beautiful!"
Spike says: "Well, enjoy it while you can, 'cause we're not getting out of this car until we're back in Ponyville!"
Apple Bloom says: "There is no way, no how, we're comin' all the way to the Crystal Empire without lookin' around!"
Spike says: "Nopony's gonna get past this dragon!"
Apple Bloom says: "Don't make me use this!"
Spike says: "You wouldn't dare!"
Spike says: "Oh no!"
Scootaloo says: "Whoa, just whoa."
Sweetie Belle says: "Ah!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I'm in crystal heaven!"
Spike says: "Shhh!"
Spike says: "They're right there!"
Spike says: "There's the bunny!"
Spike says: "Please, please, pretty please, don't go down there!"
Spike says: "I'll fluff your tail!"
Spike says: "I'll perm, highlight, and blow it out if you'll just stop!"
Spike says: "What do you want?!"
Spike says: "!"
Spike says: "Name it, and it's yours!"
Spike says: "Hyah!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh my goodness."
Conductor says: "All aboard!"
Spike says: "Hah!"
Spike says: "You're coming with me!"
Spike says: "We made it!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Without seeing the palace!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I think this car's empty."
Spike says: "They're coming this way!"
Spike says: "Everybody down!"
Sweetie Belle says: "There has to be a better solution!"
Spike says: "Shh!"
Spike says: "Oh, don't sit down, don't sit down!"
Applejack says: "Whooeee!"
Applejack says: "My dogs are barkin'."
Applejack says: "Did y'all hear that?"
Applejack says: "They really are!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Huh, bummer Spike had to miss out on all this."
Rainbow Dash says: "He woulda' had fun here."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm sure he's having a great time watching all the critters back at home."
Applejack says: "Think he's still got a handle on things?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "If he's staying calm and collected, I bet he's doing a terrific job as a leader."
Spike says: "Go ahead, bunny."
Spike says: "Do your worst."
Spike says: "I deserve it."
Spike says: "I ignored you, tried to pawn you off on someone else, I didn't take these silly things out, or fluff this like I was supposed to."
Spike says: "I wasn't really thinking about you at all."
Spike says: "Any of you."
Spike says: "Just wanted the jewels."
Spike says: "I hope you'll all forgive me someday."
Spike says: "You will?"
Spike says: "Oh great."
Spike says: "I'm gonna be the one who gives us away."
Applejack says: "You all hear that?"
Applejack says: "I can't wait to scratch the belly on Winona."
Applejack says: "Oh, I miss her."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can't wait to see Owlowiscious!"
Spike says: "Hello!"
Spike says: "Thought we'd meet you at the station!"
Sweetie Belle says: "So we could hear all about the Crystal Empire, and find out if you brought us one of the crystal snow globes that they sell at the train station!"
Rarity says: "How did you know about the snow globes?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Um..."
Sweetie Belle says: "lucky guess?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've gotta hand it to you, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You did a really good job of taking care of the animals."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, Spike, Angel looks perfect!"
Fluttershy says: "You did such a good job fluffing his tail."
Spike says: "Yeah, well..."
Spike says: "we're like this now."
Spike says: "You know who."
Twilight Sparkle says: "So what are you thinking?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Bake 'em into a jewel pie?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ooh, six-layer gem cake sounds pretty good!"
Spike says: "Yeah, it does."
Spike says: "Whyyyyyyyyy???!!!"
Spike says: "!!!"
