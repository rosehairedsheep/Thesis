Sassy Saddles says: "Oh, I have to..."
Sassy Saddles says: "Oh!"
Sassy Saddles says: "I can't believe the winter-to-spring transition is almost here!"
Sassy Saddles says: "Ohhh."
Sassy Saddles says: "I like that."
Sassy Saddles says: "I'm going to have to relabel all my binders."
Sassy Saddles says: "Right after we finish..."
Sassy Saddles says: "everything!"
Sassy Saddles says: "We still have so much to do!"
Sassy Saddles says: "Oh, my bustles and bows!"
Sassy Saddles says: "Rarity, did we—"
Sassy Saddles says: "?"
Rarity says: "Already hemmed, ruched, and cut, my dear."
Sassy Saddles says: "Oh."
Sassy Saddles says: "Rarity, no reason to panic, but, um, we seem to be temporarily low!"
Sassy Saddles says: "And when I say "temporarily low", I mean "completely out of"—"
Sassy Saddles says: "!"
Rarity says: "The baby blue sapphires?"
Rarity says: "They arrived this morning."
Sassy Saddles says: "Oh."
Sassy Saddles says: "Heh."
Sassy Saddles says: "Wonderful."
Sassy Saddles says: "Oh!"
Sassy Saddles says: "What about the design for the—"
Sassy Saddles says: "?!"
Sassy Saddles says: "!"
Rarity says: "And done!"
Sassy Saddles says: "Wow."
Sassy Saddles says: "You are good."
Sassy Saddles says: "And you've really outdone yourself this time!"
Sassy Saddles says: "The Morning Sunshine Tulip Frock is gorgeous!"
Rarity says: "Ooh, thank you."
Rarity says: "Look, I know you're worried about something slipping between the cracks."
Rarity says: "But with your managerial skills and my fabulous designs, we have everything covered."
Sassy Saddles says: "You're right."
Sassy Saddles says: "You're right."
Sassy Saddles says: "There are no cracks."
Rarity says: "Would you be a dear and fetch me some vermilion satin from the back?"
Rarity says: "And I'll start on the Eternal Elegance Empire Silhouette evening gown."
Sassy Saddles says: "My most certain pleasure!"
Rarity says: "Oh."
Rarity says: "I love this picture."
Rarity says: "When was the last time we had that kind of fun together?"
Sassy Saddles says: "Rarity, we're running low on vermilion satin."
Rarity says: "Huh?"
Sassy Saddles says: "I..."
Sassy Saddles says: "I can order more!"
Rarity says: "Sweetie Belle loves playing dress-up."
Rarity says: "I miss her so much!"
Sassy Saddles says: "Then why don't you go visit her?"
Rarity says: "I wish I..."
Rarity says: "could, but..."
Rarity says: "between..."
Rarity says: "running..."
Rarity says: "three stores and the spring-sition..."
Rarity says: "I couldn't possibly..."
Sassy Saddles says: "But you've already done almost all the work."
Sassy Saddles says: "I can handle the rest."
Rarity says: "B-B-But..."
Rarity says: "but..."
Sassy Saddles says: "Rarity, go."
Sassy Saddles says: "I have everything well in hoof."
Rarity says: "I am going to visit my sister!"
Sassy Saddles says: "Way to immediately turn that around."
Rarity says: "We can spend the whole day together!"
Rarity says: "And we can do all her favorite things!"
Sassy Saddles says: "I'm sure she'd love that."
Rarity says: "Oh, Sassy, thank you!"
Sassy Saddles says: "Of course!"
Sassy Saddles says: "Now get out of here!"
Rarity says: "I'm going!"
Rarity says: "I'm going!"
Rarity says: "Hang on, sis!"
Rarity says: "I'm coming!"
Scootaloo says: "Excuse us!"
Apple Bloom says: "Comin' through!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Cutie Mark Crusaders mid-mission here!"
Scootaloo says: "That was fun!"
Scootaloo says: "Let's do it again!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Scoot, we've got a job to do."
Scootaloo says: "Later?"
Sweetie Belle says: "All right, Chipcutter."
Sweetie Belle says: "We've done our part."
Sweetie Belle says: "The rest is up to you."
Chipcutter says: "You really think I have it in me to be a sculptor?"
Scootaloo says: "Yup!"
Chipcutter says: "But why?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Because you said you weren't good at anything except getting in trouble for making sculptures out of your lunch, right?"
Chipcutter says: "Yeah."
Chipcutter says: "I can't help it."
Chipcutter says: "When I look at my sandwich, it's like it's just asking me to..."
Chipcutter says: "turn it into a dragon."
Apple Bloom says: "Well, what is this slab asking you to turn it into?"
Chipcutter says: "Hmmm..."
Chipcutter says: "I see..."
Apple Bloom says: "Wow!"
Apple Bloom says: "T-That's incredible!"
Apple Bloom says: "It looks just like us!"
Scootaloo says: "We knew you had it in you, Chip!"
Chipcutter says: "This is way better than sandwich sculpting!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Chip, we're proud of you."
Chipcutter says: "I finally got my cutie mark!"
Apple Bloom says: "Woo-hoo!"
Apple Bloom says: "All right!"
Scootaloo says: "Yes!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Way to go!"
Scootaloo says: "Not a bad way to start a day."
Apple Bloom says: "Not a bad way at all!"
Apple Bloom says: "Helpin' ponies is just about my favorite thing to do."
Sweetie Belle says: "Another satisfied client!"
Apple Bloom says: "Mm-hmm!"
Scootaloo says: "Mm-hmm!"
Apple Bloom says: "So who's up next?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Pretty sure it's Zipporwhill."
Sweetie Belle says: "She needs help reconnecting with her cutie mark – three puppy paw prints."
Scootaloo says: "When is she swinging by?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, I think she should be arriving right about..."
Sweetie Belle says: "..."
Sweetie Belle says: "now."
Apple Bloom says: "Wow."
Apple Bloom says: "You are good."
Sweetie Belle says: "Come on in, Zipporwhill."
Scootaloo says: "Okay, so what seems to be the problem, exactly?"
Zipporwhill says: "It's my puppy, Ripley."
Zipporwhill says: "We used to be so close."
Zipporwhill says: "In fact, I got my cutie mark the day I found him and took him home."
Zipporwhill says: "But now, it's like he wants nothing to do with me."
Scootaloo says: "Don't you worry."
Scootaloo says: "You've come to the right place!"
Scootaloo says: "The Cutie Mark Crusaders are on the job!"
Apple Bloom says: "Trust us."
Apple Bloom says: "Before you know it, you and your puppy will be back to bein' besties!"
Sweetie Belle says: "You have the CMC guarantee!"
Sweetie Belle says: "No matter what it takes, we promise you'll have our full attention."
Rarity says: "Guess who's here to spend the whole day with her little sister?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "Mmmm!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Rarity, what are you doing here?"
Rarity says: "I am here to spend the day with you!"
Rarity says: "I'm so excited, I could practically faint!"
Rarity says: "You don't happen to have a fainting couch in here, do you?"
Sweetie Belle says: "No!"
Rarity says: "Oh, pfft, of course not."
Rarity says: "It's a treehouse!"
Rarity says: "That would be très gauche!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Right..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, I sure am happy to see you, and spending the day with you does sound like a lot of fun, but..."
Sweetie Belle says: "I'm kind of right in the middle of something important."
Sweetie Belle says: "I have responsibilities and..."
Rarity says: "Oh."
Apple Bloom says: "Go on, Sweetie Belle."
Apple Bloom says: "We've got this covered."
Apple Bloom says: "How often do you get to spend time with your sister?"
Scootaloo says: "Yeah!"
Scootaloo says: "Go have fun."
Sweetie Belle says: "You sure you two can handle our client here?"
Rarity says: ""Client"?"
Rarity says: "Oh, that is so adorable!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Uh, thanks?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I think?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Are you sure you two got this?"
Apple Bloom says: "We have it handled."
Rarity says: "Oh, my!"
Rarity says: "Look at this wall of satisfied customers!"
Rarity says: "You girls really have come a long way."
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, all right then."
Sweetie Belle says: "But, lemme know if you need me or run into any trouble."
Rarity says: "Come on, come on!"
Rarity says: "You'll never guess what I have planned!"
Rarity says: "Ooh!"
Rarity says: "So fun!"
Sweetie Belle says: "What?"
Rarity says: "It's just I know how much you love these puppet shows."
Sweetie Belle says: "I did."
Rarity says: "Oh, it's just like old times!"
Rarity says: "You, me, greasy popcorn."
Rarity says: "It's like no time has passed at all."
Rarity says: "Ooh!"
Rarity says: "Ooh!"
Rarity says: "Ooh!"
Rarity says: "It's your favorite part!"
Rarity says: "Banana peels are so very, very slippery!"
Rarity says: "What's the matter, darling?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I, um, guess I just prefer black box experimental theater."
Rarity says: "What?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "Since when?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I dunno."
Sweetie Belle says: "It's no big deal."
Sweetie Belle says: "This is great."
Rarity says: "Okay."
Rarity says: "We're here!"
Rarity says: "Ta-da!"
Rarity says: "Aren't you excited to be back here again?"
Rarity says: "Do I know my baby sister, or do I know my baby sister?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Uh..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Yeah..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Where is "here" exactly?"
Rarity says: "Oh, pfft!"
Rarity says: "Stop being so silly!"
Rarity says: "You know this is your favorite ice cream shop!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh."
Sweetie Belle says: "Right."
Sweetie Belle says: "From when I was a little filly."
Rarity says: "And I convinced the original owner to come out of retirement to make you your all-time favorite dessert!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Huh."
Sweetie Belle says: "I remember it being much bigger."
Rarity says: "Well, go ahead."
Rarity says: "I know you're dying to dig in."
Rarity says: "Well?"
Sweetie Belle says: "That was, uh..."
Sweetie Belle says: "one tasty bite."
Sweetie Belle says: "Still a little hungry, though."
Rarity says: "We can get another sundae!"
Rarity says: "Chocolate with rainbow sprinkles, perhaps?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I was thinking something more like a salad."
Rarity says: "A salad?"
Rarity says: "When did you get so practical?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh, um..."
Sweetie Belle says: "I guess another scoop would be fine!"
Rarity says: "One more Filly Clown Surprise, please!"
Zipporwhill says: "Hey, Ripley!"
Scootaloo says: "Look at me!"
Scootaloo says: "Over here!"
Rarity says: "I know you must be bored, darling."
Rarity says: "This is a very long line for one of Twisty Pop's balloons."
Rarity says: "But just be patient."
Rarity says: "We'll get you your favorite balloon bouquet, and it'll all be worth it."
Zipporwhill says: "Who's a good puppy?"
Zipporwhill says: "Who's a good puppy?!"
Zipporwhill says: "!"
Zipporwhill says: "You're the good puppy!"
Zipporwhill says: "Now come on, puppy-wuppy!"
Zipporwhill says: "Get the bally-wally!"
Scootaloo says: "Come on, Ripley!"
Scootaloo says: "Like this!"
Apple Bloom says: "Good Scootaloo!"
Apple Bloom says: "See?"
Zipporwhill says: "It's not working."
Scootaloo says: "Maybe if the ball tasted better?"
Apple Bloom says: "I don't think that that's it, Scoot."
Sweetie Belle says: "Doesn't look like it's going so well."
Sweetie Belle says: "I'm just gonna do a quick check with the CMCs."
Rarity says: "Well, I guess duty calls, and-and you, you have that now..."
Sweetie Belle says: "What?"
Rarity says: "Oh nothing, nothing."
Rarity says: "Go on."
Scootaloo says: "Hey, Sweetie Belle."
Scootaloo says: "How's your day with Rarity going?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, it's not exactly great..."
Apple Bloom says: "What do you mean?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I don't know."
Sweetie Belle says: "It's like Rarity doesn't even know me anymore."
Scootaloo says: "I wish we could say our day is going better."
Apple Bloom says: "But we can't."
Scootaloo says: "Seems like Zipporwhill's puppy doesn't want anything to do with her."
Sweetie Belle says: "Hmmm."
Sweetie Belle says: "I see what you mean..."
Sweetie Belle says: "You know, it's an awfully big puppy..."
Rarity says: "Sweetie Belle, hurry!"
Rarity says: "He's making it!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Gotta go..."
Rarity says: "I know just what to do with this!"
Rarity says: "And pose!"
Rarity says: "And pose!"
Rarity says: "Love the camera!"
Rarity says: "Hate the camera."
Rarity says: "Love it again!"
Rarity says: "Sweetie Belle, you did "hate the camera" for all these shots!"
Rarity says: "Let's do it again."
Sweetie Belle says: "No!"
Apple Bloom says: "Come on, Zipporwhill, you can do this!"
Rarity says: "W-What do you mean, no?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Rarity, this is hard for me to say, but..."
Sweetie Belle says: "um..."
Rarity says: "Sweetie Belle, what is it?"
Rarity says: "You've been acting weird all day."
Rarity says: "You used to love doing these things with me."
Sweetie Belle says: "That's just it!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I used to!"
Sweetie Belle says: "That's not who I am anymore!"
Zipporwhill says: "This isn't who I am!"
Zipporwhill says: "My cutie mark must be for something else, because my puppy just doesn't love me anymore!"
Zipporwhill says: "Hmph!"
Rarity says: "But it is you!"
Rarity says: "You love puppet shows and dressing up and taking silly photos and tiny little clown-shaped ice creams!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Really?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
Sweetie Belle says: "If you still think I like doing this stuff, then maybe you don't know me at all!"
Rarity says: "And after everything I did to set up a whole day of doing her favorite things!"
Rarity says: "I mean, accusing me of not knowing her?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Rarity says: "I know her better than anypony!"
Rarity says: "Um, thank you, Twisty, but the hard truth is, my sister is being unappreciative right now!"
Rarity says: "And I'm going to go and give her a piece of my mind!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Hey, Zipporwhill."
Sweetie Belle says: "What are you doing here?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Where are Apple Bloom and Scootaloo?"
Zipporwhill says: "They're with my puppy."
Zipporwhill says: "He seems to like them better than me anyway."
Sweetie Belle says: "Now, I'm sure that's not true."
Zipporwhill says: "It is."
Zipporwhill says: "He doesn't like doing anything with me anymore."
Sweetie Belle says: "I think that might be your problem right there!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Come on!"
Scootaloo says: "Find Zipporwhill, Ripley!"
Apple Bloom says: "Woof, woof!"
Apple Bloom says: "It's Zipporwhill!"
Apple Bloom says: "Woof?"
Scootaloo says: "It's hopeless."
Apple Bloom says: "Sweetie Belle!"
Scootaloo says: "Zipporwhill!"
Scootaloo says: "We're sorry we haven't figured this out yet."
Sweetie Belle says: "Don't worry, girls."
Sweetie Belle says: "I think I cracked this one."
Rarity says: "Aha!"
Rarity says: "There she is!"
Rarity says: "No matter!"
Rarity says: "I'm going to give her quite the talking to!"
Rarity says: "..."
Rarity says: "Right after she's done with her conversation."
Rarity says: "Anger is no excuse for poor manners, after all."
Sweetie Belle says: "Okay, Zipporwhill."
Sweetie Belle says: "What do you see?"
Zipporwhill says: "My puppy?"
Sweetie Belle says: "That's not what I see."
Sweetie Belle says: "I see a full-grown dog."
Zipporwhill says: "He did get bigger, I guess."
Sweetie Belle says: "He's not just bigger."
Sweetie Belle says: "He's older, too."
Sweetie Belle says: "You don't still play with the same toys from when you were a foal, do you?"
Zipporwhill says: "Oh."
Zipporwhill says: "Ohhh."
Zipporwhill says: "The squeaker is a little small for him now."
Zipporwhill says: "It's just hard for me to believe he's not the same adorable little guy I found anymore."
Sweetie Belle says: "I understand."
Sweetie Belle says: "But doing things like you used to won't turn him back into a puppy."
Zipporwhill says: "So..."
Zipporwhill says: "what do I do?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Treat him like the dog he is, and find new favorite things to do together."
Zipporwhill says: "You think so?"
Rarity says: "I know so!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Rarity?!"
Sweetie Belle says: "!"
Rarity says: "Oh, Sweetie Belle."
Rarity says: "I heard what you said, and you are so right."
Scootaloo says: "About the dog?"
Rarity says: "Yes, but about us, too."
Rarity says: "The truth is, I know you're not a little filly anymore."
Rarity says: "But it's just..."
Rarity says: "the last time we did all of those things together, I..."
Rarity says: "I didn't realize it was gonna be the last last time."
Rarity says: "I loved doing those things with you."
Rarity says: "It's hard for me to let that go."
Sweetie Belle says: "Aww, Rarity!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I love being with you too!"
Sweetie Belle says: "That will never change!"
Sweetie Belle says: "But..."
Sweetie Belle says: "maybe we could just try to do different things together?"
Zipporwhill says: "What is it, puppy?"
Zipporwhill says: "I mean, Ripley?"
Zipporwhill says: "I love you too, Ripley!"
Zipporwhill says: "Thank you, Crusaders."
Cutie Mark Crusaders says: "No problem!"
Zipporwhill says: "Oh, Ripley!"
Rarity says: "Sweetie Belle, I'm so very proud of the pony you've grown into."
Sweetie Belle says: "And I'm proud that no matter what, I'll always be your little sister."
Rarity says: "I, uh, have a little bit of time before I have to head back to Canterlot."
Rarity says: "Could we spend it together?"
Rarity says: "What would a grown pony like you want to do?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, I do have one idea..."
Rarity says: "Heh, I didn't realize your idea would be such a delicious one!"
Rarity says: "I don't know how I'm going to finish this."
Sweetie Belle says: "Oh!"
Sweetie Belle says: "I'll help you!"
