Pinkie Pie says: "Ooooh, I wish the mailpony would just come already!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I can't wait another minute to find out if Rainbow Dash got in or not!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie Pie, you're more nervous than Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm not nervous at all."
Rainbow Dash says: "When I get into the Wonderbolt Academy..."
Pinkie Pie says: "IF you get in!"
Pinkie Pie says: "If you get in!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't jinx it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm telling you, it's in the bag."
Pinkie Pie says: "Don't jinx it!"
Applejack says: "She is the best flyer in Ponyville."
Rainbow Dash says: "In Ponyville?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm probably the best flyer in all of Equestria."
Rainbow Dash says: "I wouldn't be surprised if they just went ahead and made me a Wonderbolt on the first day."
Messenger Pony says: "Got a letter here for Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash says: "I..."
Rainbow Dash says: "didn't get in."
Rainbow Dash says: "Gotcha!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ha, you guys are so gullible."
Rainbow Dash says: "Like I wasn't gonna get in!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm just sooooooooooo happy for you!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh..."
Rainbow Dash says: "thanks?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie Pie?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I kinda need to get going."
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "I'm done!"
Rainbow Dash says: "The sooner I get there, the sooner I get to show 'em my stuff!"
Rainbow Dash says: "See you guys in a week!"
Applejack says: "Good luck!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Won't need it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "DON'T FORGET TO WRITE!!!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Do you think she heard me?"
Pegasi chattering in background.
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh, yeah!"
Rainbow Dash says: "This is gonna be sweet!"
Spitfire says: "Well, lookie what we got here."
Spitfire says: "Bet y'all think you're Wonderbolt material, don't ya?"
All Pegasi says: "Yes, ma'am!"
Spitfire says: "Think you got what it takes to be an elite flyer?"
All Pegasi says: "Yes, ma'am!"
Spitfire says: "Well then."
Spitfire says: "Let me be the first to tell you..."
Spitfire says: "You don't!"
Spitfire says: "If you had what it took to be an elite flyer, you'd already be a Wonderbolt!"
Spitfire says: "Still think you're something special?"
Cloudchaser says: "No, ma'am!"
Spitfire says: "You look like you're the worst flyer in the whole academy!"
Spitfire says: "You'll probably quit after the first day!"
Rainbow Dash says: "No, ma'am!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I'd never quit, ma'am!"
Spitfire says: "Ha."
Spitfire says: "What about you?"
Spitfire says: "Bet you couldn't fly past the first flagpole without getting winded."
Lightning Dust says: "Try me, ma'am."
Spitfire says: "What's that?"
Lightning Dust says: "Let me show you what I've got, ma'am."
Spitfire says: "Ah."
Spitfire says: "You want a chance to prove yourself, huh?"
Lightning Dust says: "Yes, ma'am!"
Spitfire says: "Well then, now's your chance."
Spitfire says: "Give me five hundred laps!"
Spitfire says: "All of you!"
Pegasi moan.
Spitfire says: "Now!"
Pegasi cough.
Spitfire says: "Lap four-hundred and ninety-nine!"
Rainbow Dash says: "One more lap to go!"
Lightning Dust says: "You're on!"
Spitfire says: "Five hundred!"
Spitfire says: "Not bad..."
Spitfire says: "for a couple of newbies."
Lightning Dust says: "Name's Lightning Dust."
Rainbow Dash says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Lightning Dust says: "Wanna grab some grub in the mess hall?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Definitely."
Applejack says: "Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash hasn't even been gone twenty-four hours yet."
Applejack says: "Give her a chance to settle in first."
Applejack says: "Why don't we just go see what Twilight's up to?"
Applejack says: "I hear Princess Celestia's got her workin' on some new spells!"
Pinkie Pie says: "New spells, huh?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Okay."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait!"
Pinkie Pie says: "If I'm not here when Rainbow Dash's letter arrives, I won't be able to read it right away."
Pinkie Pie says: "And if I don't read it right away, I won't be able to write her back right away."
Pinkie Pie says: "And if I don't write her back right away, she might think I didn't get her letter, and then she might worry it got lost."
Pinkie Pie says: "And if she's worrying about her letter, she'll be distracted."
Pinkie Pie says: "And if she's distracted, then she won't do well at the academy!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And if she doesn't do well at the academy, then she'll get kicked out!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And if she gets kicked out, they'll never let her be a Wonderbolt!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And if she doesn't get to be a Wonderbolt, all her dreams will be crushed!"
Pinkie Pie says: "And it will be all..."
Pinkie Pie says: "my..."
Pinkie Pie says: "fault!"
Applejack says: "So in other words, you're stickin' by the mailbox."
Pinkie Pie says: "Yep!"
Applejack says: "Suit yourself."
Spitfire says: "The Wonderbolts are the fastest, best precision flyers in the world."
Spitfire says: "But spin-outs can still happen."
Spitfire says: "And when they do, a Wonderbolt must be able to recover quickly."
Spitfire says: "This..."
Spitfire says: "is the Dizzitron."
Spitfire says: "It's gonna make you very – I repeat – very dizzy."
Spitfire says: "Your task is to try and recover and fly straight again, as soon as possible."
Spitfire says: "Once you have recovered you must come in for a smooth landing."
Spitfire says: "Now, who's first?"
Spitfire says: "You."
Spitfire says: "You're up."
Meadow Flower says: "Me?"
Spitfire says: "Now!"
Spitfire says: "Ready?"
Meadow Flower says: "Yes, ma'am!"
Spitfire says: "Go!"
Dizzitron spinning.
Spitfire says: "Release!"
Spitfire says: "Huh."
Spitfire says: "Fifteen seconds."
Spitfire says: "Decent, but I wouldn't go writin' home about it!"
Spitfire says: "Who's next?"
Spitfire says: "Alright, Rainbow Dash."
Spitfire says: "Let's see what you got."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yes, ma'am!"
Spitfire says: "Okay, go!"
Dizzitron spinning.
Spitfire says: "Release!"
Spitfire says: "Six seconds?"
Spitfire says: "That's an academy record."
Meadow Flower says: "You made it look so easy."
Rainbow Dash says: "I make everything look easy."
Spitfire says: "Okay, Lightning Dust."
Spitfire says: "You're up."
Lightning Dust says: "Ma'am, can you put the Dizzitron at maximum speed?"
Lightning Dust says: "I wanna push my limits."
Spitfire says: "You sure about that?"
Lightning Dust says: "Yes ma'am."
Spitfire says: "Okay."
Spitfire says: "You asked for it."
Dizzitron spinning rapidly.
Spitfire says: "Release!"
Spitfire says: "Six point five seconds."
Spitfire says: "Not bad."
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh!"
Lightning Dust says: "Heh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "/Oh yeah!"
Lightning Dust says: "/Oh yeah!"
Spitfire says: "Next!"
Rainbow Dash says: "No pony even came close to six seconds."
Lightning Dust says: "They should make us Wonderbolts right now."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, they should."
Spitfire says: "Listen up!"
Spitfire says: "For the rest of the camp, you'll be working in pairs."
Spitfire says: "'Morrow morning, I'll post the teams, including who'll be lead pony and who'll be wingpony."
Spitfire says: "Good luck."
Lightning Dust says: "Like we're going to need it."
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh, yeah."
Rainbow Dash says: "So, which one of you lucky gals gets to be my wingpony?"
Rainbow Dash says: "What?"
Cloudchaser says: "Eh, you might want to check the wall."
Rainbow Dash says: "A wingpony?"
Lightning Dust says: "They made us a team!"
Lightning Dust says: "Isn't that awesome?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Permission to enter, ma'am."
Spitfire says: "What is it, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I had the best time on the Dizzitron!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Only six seconds!"
Spitfire says: "And?"
Rainbow Dash says: "And you made me a wingpony!"
Spitfire says: "Because I believe you and Lightning Dust will be an unstoppable team."
Spitfire says: "Do you not think you'll be an unstoppable team?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yes, ma'am!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I mean no, ma'am!"
Rainbow Dash says: "I mean..."
Rainbow Dash says: "We'll be an unstoppable team, ma'am."
Spitfire says: "Then what's the problem?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I think I should be lead pony, ma'am."
Spitfire says: "And I think Lightning Dust likes to push herself a little harder than you do."
Spitfire says: "That's why I made her lead pony."
Spitfire says: "Got it?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yes, ma'am."
Spitfire says: "Good."
Spitfire says: "Today you will all be participating in a flag hunt."
Spitfire says: "We'll divide you into two teams, red..."
Spitfire says: "and blue."
Spitfire says: "Whoever finds the most flags of the opposing team's color wins."
Pegasi cheering.
Meadow Flower says: "Oh, this is gonna be so much fun!"
Spitfire says: "If you think this is gonna to be fun, you are sadly mistaken."
Spitfire says: "This is for training purposes."
Spitfire says: "This is not recess."
Spitfire says: "Lead ponies and wingponies must fly together."
Spitfire says: "If any pair splits apart, they will be immediately disqualified."
Spitfire says: "Do you understand?"
All Pegasi says: "Yes, ma'am!"
Spitfire says: "Then let's go!"
Lightning Dust says: "Ready to rock and roll?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Ready."
Lightning Dust says: "You spotted any flags yet?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Not yet."
Rainbow Dash says: "Oh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "There's one!"
Lightning Dust says: "Good eyes!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We should slow down."
Rainbow Dash says: "It doesn't look like both of us can make it at this speed!"
Lightning Dust says: "Peh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ow!"
Spitfire says: "Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash found the first flag!"
Lightning Dust says: "Come on!"
Lightning Dust says: "Let's find some more!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Uh, sure."
Rainbow Dash says: "Just give me a second."
Lightning Dust says: "Oh, you're fine."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah..."
Rainbow Dash says: "totally."
Rarity says: "She's still at it."
Fluttershy says: "I just wish we could help her."
Pinkie Pie says: "Help me?"
Pinkie Pie says: "The only thing that could possibly help me right now is a letter from Rainbow Dash!"
Pinkie Pie says: "It's been three days already."
Pinkie Pie says: "By now, she probably doesn't even know our names anymore!"
Pinkie Pie says: "She probably can't remember our faces!"
Pinkie Pie says: ""Pinkie Pie?"
Pinkie Pie says: "I never heard of a Pinkie Pie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Who is Pinkie Pie?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, if you're so worried, then why don't you send her a letter first?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Of course!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That's a great idea!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh wait!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I got an even better idea!"
Pinkie Pie says: "How about we send Rainbow Dash a care package?"
Pinkie Pie says: "You know, before she forgets all about us?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Although, come on, let's face it."
Pinkie Pie says: "It's probably too late for that."
Pinkie Pie says: "But, uh, maybe it'll jog her memory somehow."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie Pie, I'm sure Rainbow Dash still remembers our faces and who we are."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But I think sending her a care package is a great idea."
Pinkie Pie says: "A care package it is!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We'll send it through the mail!"
Pinkie Pie says: "WAIT!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ah!"
Pinkie Pie says: "That won't work at all!"
Applejack says: "Why not?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Because what if the package gets lost in the mail?"
Pinkie Pie says: "What if somepony else gets the package by accident and then she remembers us instead of Rainbow Dash and then she becomes our new friend?"
Pinkie Pie says: "And then the real Rainbow Dash won't ever know that she used to have friends and she forgot them!"
Applejack says: "Is anypony else followin' this?"
Fluttershy says: "Mmm-mm."
Twilight says: "Mmm-mm."
Rarity says: "Mmm-mm."
Pinkie Pie says: "I've got it!"
Pinkie Pie says: "We'll deliver the care package to Rainbow Dash in person!"
Rarity says: "I wouldn't mind a little trip."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'll go!"
Applejack says: "Count me in!"
Fluttershy says: "Me too."
Pinkie Pie says: "Me five!"
Pinkie Pie says: "But don't be upset if she doesn't recognize you at first."
Pinkie Pie says: "It may take a while for her to get her memory back."
Spitfire says: "Today we'll be doing our famous air obstacle course."
Spitfire says: "The object of this exercise is to work on your precision flying under extreme circumstances."
Spitfire says: "And don't worry about winning."
Spitfire says: "It's not a race."
Spitfire says: "Now everypony, get on your marks!"
Lightning Dust says: "Ugh!"
Lightning Dust says: "Can't they go any faster?"
Lightning Dust says: "It's no good, I can't get around them!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Doesn't matter!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We can still fly completely in sync and blow Spitfire's mind with our moves!"
Lightning Dust says: "I guess..."
Lightning Dust says: "What are they, a couple of snails?"
Lightning Dust says: "It's just a little weather."
Lightning Dust says: "Now's our chance to pass these slowpokes!"
Pegasi screaming.
Spitfire says: "Not bad!"
Spitfire says: "And in record time, too!"
Spitfire says: "Definitely made the right decision making you two a team."
Spitfire says: "The others seem to have had a little trouble with the precision part of the exercise."
Spitfire says: "I'd better go help sort them out."
Spitfire says: "Why don't you two go hit the mess hall early?"
Lightning Dust says: "Yes, ma'am!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Thank you, ma'am."
Rainbow Dash says: "Um, Lightning Dust?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Next time, maybe we don't cut the other teams off like that."
Lightning Dust says: "Hey, you snooze, you lose!"
Lightning Dust says: "Besides, Wonderbolts are supposed to be able to recover from a spin-out."
Lightning Dust says: "You saw them on the Dizzitron!"
Lightning Dust says: "They could use the practice."
Lightning Dust says: "I mean, it's not our fault we're so much better than those other guys!"
Lightning Dust says: "Not every pony is destined to become a Wonderbolt."
Lightning Dust says: "Only the best of the best, right?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, I-I guess you're right..."
Lightning Dust says: "'Course I'm right!"
Lightning Dust says: "Now let's go fuel up!"
Lightning Dust says: "Kicking all that tail has made me hungry."
Bulk Biceps says: "Yeah!"
Lightning Dust says: "I have an idea about how we can literally blow away our competition."
Rainbow Dash says: "But we're already way ahead."
Lightning Dust says: "Are you in or not?"
Spitfire says: "Lightning Dust likes to push herself a little harder than you do."
Spitfire says: "That's why I made her lead pony."
Rainbow Dash says: "I'm in!"
Lightning Dust says: "Then follow my lead!"
Lightning Dust says: "I can't control it!"
Applejack says: "It's a twister!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hold on!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Noooooo!"
Rest of main cast says: "Huh?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Are you guys okay?"
Rarity says: "Uh-huh."
Twilight says: "Uh-huh."
Applejack says: "Uh-huh."
Fluttershy says: "Uh-huh."
Rainbow Dash says: "Pinkie Pie!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You..."
Pinkie Pie says: "remember me!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Well..."
Rainbow Dash says: "yeah, of course I remember you."
Rainbow Dash says: "But..."
Rainbow Dash says: "what are you all doing here?"
Applejack says: "We wanted to bring you a care package."
Applejack says: "Didn't realize you'd be in the middle of some crazy tornado drill."
Lightning Dust says: "That..."
Lightning Dust says: "was..."
Lightning Dust says: "awesome!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Awesome?"
Rainbow Dash says: "My friends could have been smashed to pieces!"
Lightning Dust says: "Yeah, but they weren't, right?"
Lightning Dust says: "Can't say the same for the clouds."
Lightning Dust says: "We totally wiped them out with that tornado."
Lightning Dust says: "The other cadets will have to be up there for days to bust as many as we did."
Rainbow Dash says: "A hoof bump?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Seriously?"
Rainbow Dash says: "You made me clip my wing."
Rainbow Dash says: "You sent half of our class into serious tailspins on the obstacle course."
Rainbow Dash says: "You unleashed a tornado that nearly demolished my friends!"
Lightning Dust says: "Yeah, and?"
Rainbow Dash says: "And I get that you want to be the best."
Rainbow Dash says: "So do I!"
Rainbow Dash says: "But you're going about it in the wrong way."
Lightning Dust says: "The Wonderbolts don't seem to think so."
Lightning Dust says: "After all, Spitfire did make me the leader and you the wingpony."
Rainbow Dash says: "You're right."
Rainbow Dash says: "She did."
Spitfire says: "This better be important."
Spitfire says: "You're supposed to be up there busting clouds with your partner."
Rainbow Dash says: "We're done with that, ma'am."
Spitfire says: "Already?"
Spitfire says: "That's an academy record!"
Spitfire says: "Explain your methods."
Rainbow Dash says: "That's why I'm here, ma'am."
Rainbow Dash says: "Lightning Dust decided to use a tornado."
Spitfire says: "A bit excessive for cloud-busting."
Spitfire says: "But judging from your time, it was obviously an effective tactic."
Rainbow Dash says: "Yeah, well that "effective tactic" nearly took out my friends!"
Rainbow Dash says: "No disrespect, ma'am, but there's a big difference between pushing yourself as hard as you can and just being reckless."
Rainbow Dash says: "And if being reckless is what gets rewarded around here, if that's what it means to be a Wonderbolt, then I don't want any part of it."
Spitfire says: "What are you saying, newbie?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I quit."
Applejack says: "You did what?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Rarity says: "Being a Wonderbolt was your dream!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Not anymore."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I know how much this meant to you."
Spitfire says: "Rainbow Dash!"
Spitfire says: "How dare you storm out of my office without giving me a chance to respond!"
Spitfire says: "The Wonderbolts are looking for the best flyers in Equestria, but you were right."
Spitfire says: "Being the best should never come at the expense of our fellow ponies."
Spitfire says: "It's not just about pushing ourselves."
Spitfire says: "It's about pushing ourselves in the right direction."
Spitfire says: "You've shown that you're capable of doing just that."
Spitfire says: "You're no wingpony, Rainbow Dash."
Spitfire says: "You're a leader."
Rainbow Dash says: "OhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygosh!"
Spitfire says: "Now get out there and give me twenty!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yes, ma'am!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait!"
Pinkie Pie says: "You didn't even get to open your care package!"
