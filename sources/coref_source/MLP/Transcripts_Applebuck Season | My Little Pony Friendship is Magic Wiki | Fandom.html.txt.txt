Applejack says: "Boy howdy!"
Applejack says: "I got my work cut out for me."
Applejack says: "That there is the biggest bumper crop o' apples I ever laid eyes on."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Big McIntosh says: "Too big for you to handle on your own."
Applejack says: "Come on, big brother!"
Applejack says: "You need to rest up and get yourself better."
Applejack says: "I haven't met an apple orchard yet that I can't handle."
Applejack says: "Oops, sorry."
Applejack says: "I'll take a bite out of this job by day's end."
Big McIntosh says: "Biting off more than you can chew is just what I'm afraid of."
Applejack says: "Are you sayin' my mouth is makin' promises my legs can't keep?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Applejack says: "Why of all the..."
Applejack says: "This is your sister Applejack, remember?"
Applejack says: "The loyalest of friends and the most dependable of ponies?"
Big McIntosh says: "But still only one pony, and one pony plus hundreds o' apple trees just doesn't add up to..."
Applejack says: "Don't you use your fancy mathematics to muddy the issue!"
Applejack says: "I said I could handle this harvest and I'm gonna prove it to you."
Applejack says: "I'm gonna get every last apple out of those trees this applebuck season all by myself."
Applejack says: "Well I better get kickin'."
Applejack says: "These apples aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees."
Applejack says: "Hey!"
Applejack says: "Oh no."
Rainbow Dash says: "STAMPEDE!"
Sweetie Drops says: "Stampede!"
Pinkie Pie says: "This makes my voice sound silly!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Pinkie Pie, are you crazy?!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Run!"
Mayor Mare says: "Everypony calm down."
Mayor Mare says: "There is no need to panic."
Rarity says: "But Mayor, whatever shall we do?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Look there!"
Applejack says: "YEEHAW!"
Applejack says: "Move aside, Winona."
Applejack says: "Put 'em up, girl!"
Pinkie Pie says: "This is the best rodeo show I've ever seen."
Applejack says: "Come on, little dogies!"
Applejack says: "Turn!"
Applejack says: "Attagirl."
Applejack says: "Yee haw!"
Applejack says: "Whoaaa."
Applejack says: "Hooie."
Applejack says: "Now what was that all about?"
DaisyJo says: "Oh my!"
DaisyJo says: "Begging your pardon, Applejack, but Moo-riella here saw one of those nasty snakes."
DaisyJo says: "And it just gave us all the willies, don'tcha know."
Applejack says: "I completely understand."
Applejack says: "Just next time, try and steer clear of Ponyville."
DaisyJo says: "We certainly will, Applejack."
DaisyJo says: "So long, Winona!"
[crowd says: "Applejack!"
Applejack says: "Yee haw!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yee haw!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ride 'em, cowpony!"
Mayor Mare says: "Applejack was just..."
Mayor Mare says: "just..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Appletastic!"
Mayor Mare says: "Exactly."
Mayor Mare says: "We must do something to thank Applejack for single-hoofedly saving the town."
Pinkie Pie says: "I know."
Pinkie Pie says: "A party!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We all ready?"
Rarity says: "Just one last thing."
Rarity says: "Now we're ready."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Is Applejack all set?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Actually, I haven't seen her all week."
Pinkie Pie says: "Not since the stampede."
Rainbow Dash says: "But she'll be here for sure."
Rainbow Dash says: "Applejack is never late."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Welcome, everypony!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Today we are here to honor a pony we can always count on to help in matters great and small."
Rainbow Dash says: "Did you see Applejack's slick moves out there?"
Rainbow Dash says: "What an athlete."
Rainbow Dash says: "This week she's gonna help me with my new flying trick, and I know it's gonna be so awesome."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Exactly."
Twilight Sparkle says: "And..."
Pinkie Pie says: "This week, I get to run Sugarcube Corner for the first time."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What does that have to do with Applejack?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Oh."
Pinkie Pie says: "Applejack, one of the best bakers ever, is gonna help me."
Pinkie Pie says: "Applejack makes everything great, so free samples for everypony!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh-kay, that's great."
Fluttershy says: "Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "--rupted."
Fluttershy says: "Twilight, I'm so sorry, but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also helping me this week with the official bunny census, where we count up all the new baby bunnies that were born this season."
Fluttershy says: "She's gonna help gather them using her wonderful herding skills."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Anyone else?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Anyone?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well then, as I was trying to say..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Urgh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Never mind."
Mayor Mare says: "Ah-ahem."
Mayor Mare says: "And so, with no further ado, it is my privilege to give the prize, Pony of Ponyville Award, to our beloved guest of honor, a pony of the utmost trustworthiness, reliability, and integrity."
Mayor Mare says: "Ponyville's most capable and dependable friend: Applejack!"
Spike says: "Cool!"
Spike says: "Way to go Applejack, that was awesome!"
Spike says: "I mean-- heh."
Mayor Mare says: "Ah-ahem."
Spike says: "Awkward."
Applejack says: "I'm here."
Applejack says: "I'm here."
Applejack says: "It's so bright and shiny and, heh, heh heh, I sure do look funny heh."
Applejack says: "Ooo-ooo."
Pinkie Pie says: "Woo-ooo."
Applejack says: "Ooo-ooo."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Okay."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Well, thank you Applejack for saving us from that scary stampede, and always being there for everypony."
Applejack says: "Oh, uh, yeah."
Applejack says: "Uh, Thanks."
Rainbow Dash says: "Tired?"
Fluttershy says: "Dizzy?"
Rarity says: "Messy?"
Rarity says: "Well, did you see her mane?"
Pinkie Pie says: "She seemed fine to me."
Pinkie Pie says: "Woo!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Woo!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hmm."
Applejack says: "O-oah."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What on Earth is that pony doing?"
Applejack says: "Whoops."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hey Applejack!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack."
Twilight Sparkle says: "AppleJACK!"
Applejack says: "Oh, howdy, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What is all this?"
Applejack says: "It's Applebuck season."
Applejack says: "Whoa."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applewhat season?"
Applejack says: "Neh, It's what the Apple family calls harvestin' time."
Applejack says: "We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell 'em."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But why are you doing it all alone?"
Applejack says: "'cause Big McIntosh hurt himself."
Twilight Sparkle says: "What about all those relatives I've met when I first came to Ponyville?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Can't they help?"
Applejack says: "They were just here for the Apple family reunion."
Applejack says: "They actually live all over Equestria and are busy harvestin' their own orchards."
Applejack says: "So, uh, I'm on my own."
Applejack says: "Which means, I should really get back to work."
Applejack says: "Ahem..."
Applejack says: "hint hint?"
Applejack says: "Get back to work?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Fine."
Applejack says: "Could you step aside, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I just did."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack, you don't look so good."
Applejack says: "Eh, don't any of you three worry none, I'm just fine and dandy."
Applejack says: "Whoa."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Do you..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "want some help?"
Applejack says: "Help?"
Applejack says: "No way, no how."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But there's no way you can do it all on your own."
Applejack says: "Is that a challenge?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Uhm..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "no?"
Applejack says: "Well, I'm gonna prove to you that I can do it!"
Applejack says: "Now if you'll excuse me, I've got apples to buck."
Rainbow Dash says: "There you are."
Applejack says: "I'm a mite sorry, Rainbow."
Applejack says: "I was busy applebuckin' and I guess ah, I closed my eyes for a second and, when I woke up, I was late."
Applejack says: "Now, what's this new trick a' yours?"
Rainbow Dash says: "See this contraption?"
Applejack says: "Uh..."
Applejack says: "Yeah."
Rainbow Dash says: "Well, I'm gonna stand on one end, then you're gonna jump down from that platform, launching me into the air faster than I can take off on my own."
Rainbow Dash says: "Once I'm in the air, I'm gonna do some amazing flips and spins that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts."
Applejack says: "Isn't that a mite dangerous?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Pfft, Heh, not for a pony who can fly."
Applejack says: "Well, all right-y then."
Applejack says: "Oh my."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ready?"
Rainbow Dash says: "One..."
Rainbow Dash says: "two..."
Rainbow Dash says: "THREE!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Umm..."
Rainbow Dash says: "maybe I wasn't clear."
Rainbow Dash says: "You're supposed to land on the other end."
Applejack says: "Got it."
Rainbow Dash says: "Applejack, what the hay is going on?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I mean, I thought I was working with Ponyville's best athlete!"
Applejack says: "You are."
Applejack says: "I'm okay."
Applejack says: "Really."
Applejack says: "I-I have an idea."
Applejack says: "Watch this."
Applejack says: "Ta da!"
Applejack says: "Oh..."
Applejack says: "Maybe not."
Applejack says: "Okay, one more try."
Applejack says: "I'm sure to get it this time."
Rainbow Dash says: "Ugh!"
Applejack says: "Heh heh..."
Applejack says: "Here I go!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Wait, Applejaaaaack!"
Applejack says: "You're welcome!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Can I help you?"
Rainbow Dash says: "I think somepony else needs your help."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack?"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yep."
Applejack says: "Ow!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack, can we talk?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack, can we talk?"
Applejack says: "Can bees squawk?!"
Applejack says: "!"
Applejack says: "I don't think so."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Can we talk?"
Applejack says: "Twenty stalks?"
Applejack says: "Bean or celery?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "No!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I need to talk to you."
Applejack says: "You need to walk to the zoo?"
Applejack says: "Well, who's stoppin' you?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "I need to talk to you!"
Applejack says: "Oh!"
Applejack says: "Well why didn't you say so?"
Applejack says: "What you wanna talk about?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rainbow Dash dropped in to see me today."
Applejack says: "That's quite neighborly of her."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Yes, except that she crashed onto my balcony after you launched her into the air."
Applejack says: "Oh, yeah."
Applejack says: "I wasn't feeling quite myself this morning."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Because you're working too hard and you need help."
Applejack says: "What?"
Applejack says: "Kelp?"
Applejack says: "I don't need kelp."
Applejack says: "I don't even like seaweed."
Twilight Sparkle says: "HELP!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You need HELP!"
Applejack says: "Nothin' doin', Twilight."
Applejack says: "I'm gonna prove to you, t'everypony, that I can do this on my own."
Applejack says: "Ow!"
Applejack says: "Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go help Pinkie Pie."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh."
Mrs. Cake says: "Now Pinkie Pie, are you sure you're up for baking the muffins and running the store this afternoon?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Yes siree bob, Mrs."
Pinkie Pie says: "Cake."
Pinkie Pie says: "Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help me out."
Pinkie Pie says: "Why, she's the best baker ever."
Pinkie Pie says: "Right, Applejack?"
Mr. Cake says: "No?"
Mr. Cake says: "You're not the best baker ever?"
Applejack says: "WHAT?"
Applejack says: "Oh no!"
Applejack says: "I mean, don't you fret."
Applejack says: "I can bake anything from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye."
Mrs. Cake says: "All right."
Mrs. Cake says: "Well, see you later, girls!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'."
Pinkie Pie says: "All right-y!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I'll get the sugar and the eggs."
Pinkie Pie says: "Can you get me some chocolate chips?"
Applejack says: "Eh, uh, whu, what was that?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Chocolate chips."
Applejack says: "Chips..."
Applejack says: "got it."
Applejack says: "Tater chips, a little salty and dry, okie-dokie."
Applejack says: "What next?"
Pinkie Pie says: "Baking soda."
Applejack says: "Soda."
Applejack says: "Perfect."
Applejack says: "That'll get the tater chips nice and wet."
Applejack says: "Now what?"
Pinkie Pie says: "A cup of flour."
Applejack says: "A cup o' sour?"
Applejack says: "Well, lemons are sure sour."
Applejack says: "One cup o' sour, comin' up."
Applejack says: "Anything else, Pinkie?"
Pinkie Pie says: "One last thing."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wheat germ."
Applejack says: "Wheat worms?"
Applejack says: "Oh, that must be fancy talk for earthworms."
Pinkie Pie says: "Now that's gonna be delicious."
Applejack says: "If you say so."
Pinkie Pie says: "Free muffin sample spectacular!"
Applejack says: "Yeah!"
Applejack says: "Muffin spectacles!"
Applejack says: "Get 'em while they're hot."
Twilight Sparkle says: "We came as soon as we heard."
Nurse Redheart says: "Oh thank you, Twilight."
Nurse Redheart says: "We need all the help we can get."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh no!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "What happened?"
Nurse Redheart says: "It was a mishap with some of the baked goods."
Pinkie Pie says: "No, not baked goods, baked bads."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack."
Spike says: "Want one?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack, we need to talk."
Applejack says: "Wha, huh?"
Applejack says: "Oh, it's you, Twilight."
Applejack says: "I know what you're gonna say, but the answer is still no."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Not to upset your applecart, but you need help."
Applejack says: "Hardy har."
Applejack says: "And no I don't."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Here, let me help."
Applejack says: "Help?"
Applejack says: "No thanks."
Applejack says: "."
Twilight Sparkle says: "AJ, think you're beating a dead..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "tree."
Applejack says: "I knew that."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Actually, Applejack, I had something else to talk to you about."
Applejack says: "You know, I'm a little busy to get lectured right now, Twilight."
Applejack says: "Ugh."
Applejack says: "No, no, NO!"
Applejack says: "How many times do I gotta say it?"
Applejack says: "I don't need no help from nopony!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Ugh."
Twilight Sparkle says: "That pony is stubborn as a mule."
Twilight Sparkle says: "No offense."
Mule says: "None taken."
Fluttershy says: "Oh Applejack!"
Fluttershy says: "Thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit roundup."
Applejack says: "Ugh."
Applejack says: "Why are we doin' this?"
Fluttershy says: "Well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born, so it's my job to get a count of all the new families."
Applejack says: "Fine."
Applejack says: "Can we just get on with it?"
Fluttershy says: "Certainly, but remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows."
Fluttershy says: "They're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently."
Applejack says: "I do NOT need any direction on corrallin' critters."
Applejack says: "Right, Winona?"
Fluttershy says: "Okay, little bunnies!"
Fluttershy says: "I need you to all gather here in the middle."
Applejack says: "That's right!"
Applejack says: "Let's go, bunnies."
Applejack says: "In the center."
Applejack says: "Hop to it."
Applejack says: "Swell."
Applejack says: "Just swell."
Applejack says: "Put 'em up, Winona!"
Fluttershy says: "Applejack!"
Fluttershy says: "Winona!"
Fluttershy says: "Stop!"
Fluttershy says: "You're scaring them."
Applejack says: "We know what we're doin'."
Applejack says: "Get along, little bunnies."
Fluttershy says: "Oh no."
Rainbow Dash says: "STAMPEDE!"
Daisy says: "Stampede!"
Rose says: "The horror, the horror."
Lily Valley says: "It was awful."
Daisy says: "A disaster."
Daisy says: "A horrible, horrible disaster."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't get it."
Lily Valley says: "Our gardens, destroyed."
Rose says: "Every last flower, devoured."
Daisy says: "By..."
Daisy says: "by..."
Daisy says: "THEM!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh my."
Fluttershy says: "Oh..."
Fluttershy says: "Please stop, little bunnies."
Fluttershy says: "Oh no!"
Fluttershy says: "Please, let's go home."
Fluttershy says: "Oh my goodness."
Twilight Sparkle says: "All right."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Enough is enough."
Applejack says: "Must  more."
Applejack says: "Must finish harvestin'."
Twilight Sparkle says: "All right, Applejack."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Your applebucking hasn't just caused you problems, it's over-propelled Pegasus', practically poisoned plenty of ponies, and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I don't care what you say, you."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Need."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Help."
Applejack says: "Ha!"
Applejack says: "No, I don't."
Applejack says: "Look, I did it."
Applejack says: "I harvested the entire Sweet Apple Acres without your help."
Applejack says: "How d'ya like them apples?"
Big McIntosh says: "Um, how do you like them apples?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack."
Applejack says: "Huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, good, you're okay."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Now Applejack, I completely respect the Apple family ways."
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're always there to help anypony in need, so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride aside and allow your friends to help you."
Applejack says: "Okay, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I am not taking "no" for an answer--what?"
Applejack says: "Yes, Twilight."
Applejack says: "Yes, please."
Applejack says: "I could really use your help."
My friend Applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have, and she's always there to help anypony. The only trouble is, when she needs help, she finds it hard to accept it, so while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends, it's also about accepting what our friends have to offer.
Your faithful student,.
Twilight Sparkle.
Applejack says: "How about y'all take a little break?"
Applejack says: "I got some fine apple juice waitin' for ya!"
Applejack says: "Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help."
Applejack says: "I was acting a bit stubborn."
Twilight Sparkle says: "A bit?"
Applejack says: "Okay."
Applejack says: "A mite stubborn, and I'm awful sorry."
Applejack says: "Now, I know the town gave me the Prized Pony award, but the real award is having you five as my friends."
Rainbow Dash says: "Phew!"
Rainbow Dash says: "That applebucking sure made me hungry."
Spike says: "And I've got the perfect treat."
Pinkie Pie says: "Eeew..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Spike, I threw those all away."
Pinkie Pie says: "Where'd you get them?"
Spike says: "From the trash."
Ponies says: "EW!"
Spike says: "Just a little nibble?"
Spike says: "Come on."
Ponies says: "Ew!"
Ponies says: "Gross!"
