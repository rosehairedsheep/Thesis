Apple Bloom says: "Hmm..."
Apple Bloom says: "I just don't feel like it's quite finished."
Sweetie Belle says: "I know what you mean."
Sweetie Belle says: "If it's for Miss Cheerilee, it needs to be perfect."
Sweetie Belle says: "Hearts and Hooves Day only comes once a year, after all."
Scootaloo says: "I say we add a little more ribbon!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah."
Sweetie Belle says: "And just a tiny bit more lace."
Apple Bloom says: "A few more hoof-prints."
Scootaloo says: "Glitter!"
Scootaloo says: "It could definitely use just a little more glitter!"
Apple Bloom says: "Now that'll show Miss Cheerilee how much we care about her."
Apple Bloom says: "Just have to get it to the Hearts and Hooves party at school."
Scootaloo says: "I think we're gonna need a bigger envelope."
Diamond Tiara says: "I like the red ones."
Cheerilee says: "It's lovely."
Cheerilee says: "And so..."
Cheerilee says: "big!"
Apple Bloom says: "We just wanted to let you know that we think you're the best teacher in the whole wide world!"
Apple Bloom says: "And we think you're super!"
Apple Bloom says: "And that we love you so so much!"
Apple Bloom says: "Ever!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Ever!"
Scootaloo says: "Ever!"
Cheerilee says: "Thank you so much, girls."
Cheerilee says: "I love it."
Cheerilee says: "I really do."
Sweetie Belle says: "I'm sure it's nothing compared to the gifts you've gotten from your..."
Sweetie Belle says: "very special somepony."
Cheerilee says: "Oh, I don't have a very special somepony at the moment."
Apple Bloom says: "Really?"
Sweetie Belle says: "How could somepony as amazing as you not have a very special somepony on Hearts and Hooves Day?"
Cheerilee says: "It's alright, Sweetie Belle."
Cheerilee says: "I have lots of good friends and wonderful students who care about me very much."
Cheerilee says: "I'm gonna have an absolutely terrific Hearts and Hooves Day."
Cheerilee says: "Alright, everypony, who's ready to play "Pin the Heart on the Pony"?"
Apple Bloom says: "If anypony deserves a very special somepony, it's her."
Apple Bloom says: "Uh, you all right?"
Sweetie Belle says: "I'm more than all right."
Sweetie Belle says: "I've just come up with the best idea ever."
Sweetie Belle says: "We're gonna find Miss Cheerilee a very special somepony."
Apple Bloom says: "That is the best idea ever."
Sweetie Belle says: "Tooold yooou!"
Apple Bloom says: "So what are we waiting for?"
Apple Bloom says: "Hearts and Hooves Day is almost over!"
Apple Bloom says: "Let's get out there and find somepony special for Cheerilee already."
Sweetie Belle says: "Yeah!"
Scootaloo says: "Let's do it!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Now it can't be just anypony."
Sweetie Belle says: "Miss Cheerilee is one of the best mares in Ponyville."
Sweetie Belle says: "She deserves to have one of the best stallions as her very special somepony."
Sweetie Belle.
Cheerilee is sweet and kind,.
She's the best teacher we could hope for.
The perfect stallion you and I must find.
One to really make her heart so-o-oar.
But...
This one's too young,.
This one's too old.
He clearly has a terrible cold.
"Hay Fever" says: "Achoo!"
Apple Bloom.
This guy's too silly.
He's way too uptight.
"Persnickety" says: "I say!"
Sweetie Belle.
Well nothing's wrong with this one,.
He seems alright...
Scootaloo says: "His girlfriend sure thinks so."
Sweetie Belle.
How 'bout this one?
Apple Bloom.
He's much too flashy.
Scootaloo.
He might do!
Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle.
If he weren't so splashy!
Apple Bloom.
Too short.
Sweetie Belle.
Too tall.
Apple Bloom.
Too clean.
Scootaloo.
Too smelly.
Sweetie Belle.
Too strangely obsessed with tubs of jelly.
Apple Bloom.
I don't think that we're mistaken,.
It seems all the good ones are taken.
Sweetie Belle.
I really feel that at this rate,.
We'll never find the perfect date.
Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle.
Don't wanna quit and give up hope!
Scootaloo says: "Doing anything special for Hearts and Hooves Day?"
Sweetie Belle.
Oh please, oh please oh please say—.
Big McIntosh says: "Nope."
Sweetie Belle.
We did it girls,.
We've found the one!
Who will send our teacher's heart aflutter!
Apple Bloom says: "Wait a minute."
Apple Bloom says: "Lemme get this straight."
Apple Bloom says: "Are you talkin' 'bout my brother?"
Scootaloo says: "Sweetie Belle is right."
Scootaloo says: "Big McIntosh is the perfect match for Miss Cheerilee."
Scootaloo says: "He's really nice, super hard-working."
Apple Bloom says: "Hmm..."
Apple Bloom says: "but he's also pretty shy."
Apple Bloom says: "He's never gonna ask Miss Cheerilee to be his very special somepony."
Sweetie Belle says: "Maybe he doesn't have to."
Apple Bloom says: "Huh?"
Sweetie Belle says: "If we can get Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee in a really romantic setting, I bet she'll ask him."
Scootaloo says: "Sounds like a plan to me."
Apple Bloom says: "So?"
Apple Bloom says: "What are we waitin' for?"
Apple Bloom says: "Let's get out there and create the perfect date!"
Apple Bloom says: "Yay!"
Scootaloo says: "Yay!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Yay!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Flowers."
Sweetie Belle says: "Don't forget the flowers."
Apple Bloom says: "Oops."
Apple Bloom says: "I'm on it!"
Scootaloo says: "They're coming!"
Scootaloo says: "This is gonna be perfect."
Scootaloo says: "Miss Cheerilee is gonna have the best Hearts and Hooves Day ever."
Sweetie Belle says: "With her new very special somepony."
Cheerilee says: "Hi, girls."
Apple Bloom says: "Hi, Miss Cheerilee."
Scootaloo says: "Hi, Miss Cheerilee."
Sweetie Belle says: "Hi, Miss Cheerilee."
Cheerilee says: "So you three said you needed help identifying a tree you found here near the gazebo?"
Cheerilee says: "..."
Cheerilee says: "That's an apple tree."
Apple Bloom says: "Is it?"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, sorry, big brother."
Apple Bloom says: "We went and fixed up the gazebo all on our own."
Apple Bloom says: "See?"
Scootaloo says: "As long as you're here, why not have a bite to eat from this romantic-looking picnic?"
Scootaloo says: "Oh gosh, seems like there's only room for two."
Apple Bloom says: "I guess we'll just be goin' then."
Scootaloo says: "You really think this'll work?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Of course it will work."
Sweetie Belle says: "They're perfect for each other."
Cheerilee says: "Beautiful day we're having."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Cheerilee says: "Any big plans for tonight?"
Big McIntosh says: "Nnnope."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, come on, Miss Cheerilee, ask him to be your very special somepony."
Sweetie Belle says: "Ohmigosh, look."
Cheerilee says: "Big Mac..."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup?"
Cheerilee says: "You have something stuck in your teeth."
Sweetie Belle says: "Aw, come on!"
Cheerilee says: "Well this has been..."
Cheerilee says: "strange."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Cheerilee says: "I need to get going, but it's always great running into a good friend."
Big McIntosh says: "Yup."
Apple Bloom says: "Do you think it just wasn't romantic enough?"
Scootaloo says: "Maybe it was too romantic."
Sweetie Belle says: "Either way, we failed."
Apple Bloom says: "There's gotta be somethin' else we could– UGH!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh my goodness, I didn't even see you there."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I'm so so sorry."
Apple Bloom says: "Aw, it's okay, Twilight."
Apple Bloom says: "It was an accident."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I've just been reading the most fascinating book about Hearts and Hooves Day."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Did you know that this holiday got its start because of a love potion?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Did you say..."
Sweetie Belle says: "a love potion?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "That's right."
Twilight Sparkle says: "It even has the recipe."
Sweetie Belle says: "I..."
Sweetie Belle says: "don't suppose we could borrow that book for a little while, do ya?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Of course you can."
Scootaloo says: "Hey!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Fast, not slow."
Apple Bloom says: "Serve to two ponies who aren't in the know."
Apple Bloom says: "I feel kind of bad trickin' my brother and Miss Cheerilee this way."
Sweetie Belle says: "What's the problem?"
Sweetie Belle says: "We all agreed these two are perfect for one another."
Scootaloo says: "Yeah, they just need a little nudge."
Sweetie Belle says: "And what could make them happier than being together, right?"
Apple Bloom says: "Right!"
Scootaloo says: "Oh, oh, here they come."
Apple Bloom says: "Hiya, Miss Cheerilee."
Cheerilee says: "Hello again, girls."
Cheerilee says: "Hello, Big Mac."
Sweetie Belle says: "Punch!"
Cheerilee says: "Excuse me?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Punch!"
Sweetie Belle says: "We made punch."
Sweetie Belle says: "We were gonna set up a stand and try to sell it but, heh, we needed somepony to taste-test it first."
Apple Bloom says: "Yup."
Sweetie Belle says: "We thought you two would be perfect together."
Sweetie Belle says: "To test it."
Sweetie Belle says: "Together."
Sweetie Belle says: "So, uh, we'll just leave you two alone."
Sweetie Belle says: "Together, to test it."
Cheerilee says: "I'm very sorry about this."
Cheerilee says: "I mentioned to the girls that I don't have a very special somepony, and I believe they're putting us in these awkward situations because they've decided it should be you."
Cheerilee says: "I suppose we should just humor them for a moment."
Cheerilee says: "This punch does look delicious."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Sweetie Belle says: "I think they're gonna drink it."
Cheerilee says: "To good friends!"
Scootaloo says: "They're drinking it."
Scootaloo says: "They're drinking it!"
Scootaloo says: "They're looking into each other's eyes."
Apple Bloom says: "They're about to be in for a big surprise!"
Scootaloo says: "They're about to be in for a big surprise!"
Sweetie Belle says: "They're about to be in for a big surprise!"
Cheerilee says: "Big Mac?"
Big McIntosh says: "Yup?"
Cheerilee says: "Will you be my very special somepony?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Sweetie Belle says: "YES!"
Apple Bloom says: "He's her special somepony!"
Scootaloo says: "He's her special somepony!"
Sweetie Belle says: "He's her special somepony!"
Apple Bloom says: "She's his special somepony!"
Scootaloo says: "She's his special somepony!"
Sweetie Belle says: "She's his special somepony!"
Cheerilee says: "He's my special somepony."
Big McIntosh says: "Eeeeeyup."
Apple Bloom says: "Aww!"
Scootaloo says: "Aww!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Aww!"
Cheerilee says: "He's my shmoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony pie."
Big McIntosh says: "You're my shmoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony pie."
Cheerilee says: "You're my cutie-patootie lovie-dovie honey-bunny."
Big McIntosh says: "You're my heartie-smartie smoochie-woochie baby-waby."
Apple Bloom says: "Big Mac!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hey!"
Apple Bloom says: "Hello!"
Apple Bloom says: "What's going on?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Miss Cheerilee, are you alright?"
Cheerilee says: "I have a special somepony."
Cheerilee says: "A kissy-wissy snuggy-wuggy sugar bear."
Sweetie Belle says: "I think we may have given them too big of a nudge."
Big McIntosh says: "You're my cuddly-wuddly boopsie-woopsie pumpkin pie."
Sweetie Belle says: "Eugh!!"
Scootaloo says: "Eugh!!"
Scootaloo says: "Ya think?"
Apple Bloom says: "What have we done?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Apple Bloom says: "My brother's actin' like a grade-A goofball!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Maybe we added too much rainbow."
Scootaloo says: "Or maybe not enough cloud."
Sweetie Belle says: "Or maybe..."
Sweetie Belle says: "uh-oh."
Apple Bloom says: "Whaddaya mean, "uh-oh?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Sweetie Belle says: "We might not have given Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee a love potion."
Sweetie Belle says: "We may have given them a love poison."
Apple Bloom says: "What?!"
Scootaloo says: "What?!"
Apple Bloom says: "!"
Scootaloo says: "!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Apparently, some prince a long time ago whipped up this recipe and gave it to this princess he liked."
Sweetie Belle says: "He meant it to be a love potion, but things didn't turn out so well."
Apple Bloom says: "How "not so well" did things turn out?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Well, there's something here about a dragon, the kingdom falling, chaos reigning..."
Sweetie Belle says: "Okay, apparently it was all because the prince and princess were so lost in each other's eyes that they couldn't perform their royal duties."
Apple Bloom says: "Great!"
Apple Bloom says: "We've not only turned Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee into a couple of nonsense-spoutin' nincompoops, we may have put all of Ponyville in jeopardy!"
Scootaloo says: "Come on, Apple Bloom."
Scootaloo says: "Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac don't have any royal duties."
Apple Bloom says: "But they still got responsibilities."
Apple Bloom says: "If we don't fix this..."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh no, Miss Cheerilee won't be able to teach."
Apple Bloom says: "Big Mac won't be able to harvest any apples, and before you know it..."
Apple Bloom says: "Ponyville will be overrun with uneducated little ponies starvin' for apples."
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, it'll be chaos!"
Apple Bloom says: "It'll be chaos!"
Sweetie Belle says: "There's an antidote!"
Apple Bloom says: "Well, why didn't you say so?"
Apple Bloom says: "Didn't you see me gettin' all panicked back there?"
Sweetie Belle says: "If we can keep Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac from looking into each other's eyes for one full hour, the love curse will be broken."
Scootaloo says: "Only an hour?"
Scootaloo says: "Pfh, we can pull that off in a second."
Cheerilee says: "You take the first sip, snuggle-wuggles."
Big McIntosh says: "No, you take it, schnoodle-dumplin'."
Cheerilee says: "No, you, shnooky-lumps."
Big McIntosh says: "No, you, pookie-pie."
Mrs. Cake says: "I'm all for romance, but this has been going on for hours."
Mrs. Cake says: "What's happened to these two?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Who knows?"
Mrs. Cake says: "Well, these lovebirds will probably be planning a wedding soon."
Mrs. Cake says: "I can always use the catering business."
Sweetie Belle says: "A wedding!"
Sweetie Belle says: "That's it!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac should get married!"
Apple Bloom says: "How is gettin' hitched gonna keep them apart?"
Sweetie Belle says: "They aren't really gonna get married."
Sweetie Belle says: "They're just gonna get ready to get married."
Cheerilee says: "No, you, biscuit-wiscuit bear!"
Big McIntosh says: "Nope, you, huggy-wuggy snuggy bunny!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Hi, Miss Cheerilee, how are you?"
Cheerilee says: "I have a very special somepony."
Big McIntosh says: "I have a very special somepony."
Apple Bloom says: "Yeah, we noticed."
Sweetie Belle says: "Gosh, you two are so in love, the next thing you know, you'll be getting married."
Cheerilee says: "Married?!"
Big McIntosh says: "Married?!"
Cheerilee says: "!"
Big McIntosh says: "!"
Sweetie Belle says: "That's right."
Sweetie Belle says: "Maaarriiied."
Cheerilee says: "Married..."
Big McIntosh says: "Married..."
Apple Bloom says: "Ugh!"
Apple Bloom says: "'Course, if you're gonna get married, you wanna pick out a really nice diamond for your – ugh!"
Apple Bloom says: "– shmoopy-doopy, uh, pookie-pie."
Big McIntosh says: "Diamond!"
Cheerilee says: "Shmoopy!"
Scootaloo says: "Don't you think you should start looking for your wedding dress?"
Scootaloo says: "You'll wanna look your best for your..."
Scootaloo says: "honey-bunny snuggle-baby."
Cheerilee says: "Oh!"
Cheerilee says: "Dress!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Now we just need to keep them apart."
Sweetie Belle says: "I'll keep Miss Cheerilee occupied."
Sweetie Belle says: "You two do the same with Big Mac."
Apple Bloom says: "No problem."
Sweetie Belle says: "Meet you back at the clubhouse in an hour when this whole mess is over."
Sweetie Belle says: "This one looks nice."
Sweetie Belle says: "Better try it on though."
Sweetie Belle says: "Ten minutes down, fifty minutes to go."
Apple Bloom says: "No."
Apple Bloom says: "No."
Apple Bloom says: "Not that one either."
Apple Bloom says: "No."
Apple Bloom says: "Too..."
Apple Bloom says: "shiny."
Apple Bloom says: "No."
Apple Bloom says: "You know, somethin' less..."
Apple Bloom says: "shiny."
"Karat" says: "Mmm."
Apple Bloom says: "Miss Cheerilee deserves the best."
Apple Bloom says: "How much time is left?"
Apple Bloom says: "I'm runnin' out of ways to make diamonds sound bad."
Scootaloo says: "We still have twenty five minutes."
Apple Bloom says: "Where's my brother?"
"Karat" says: "He made his purchase and departed out the back."
"Karat" says: "Said something about needing to see his..."
"Karat" says: "shmoopy-shmoo."
Scootaloo says: "Ugh."
Apple Bloom says: "Okay, I'll see what I can do to slow him down."
Apple Bloom says: "You go on to Carousel Boutique and warn Sweetie Belle."
Sweetie Belle says: "What's wrong?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Where's Apple Bloom?"
Sweetie Belle says: "Where's Big Mac?"
Scootaloo says: "On  out of boutique."
Apple Bloom says: "Huh?"
Scootaloo says: "Move away!"
Apple Bloom says: "He'll get to her!"
Apple Bloom says: "He's too strong!"
Sweetie Belle says: "Let him go!"
Big McIntosh says: "Shmoopy-doo– Whoa!"
Scootaloo says: "I sure am glad you found those shovels."
Apple Bloom says: "One more minute and the spell will be broken!"
Big McIntosh says: "Shmoopy-doo!"
Cheerilee says: "Sweetums?!"
Cheerilee says: "!"
Big McIntosh says: "Shmoopy-doo!"
Apple Bloom says: "Oh, please be normal, please be normal."
Cheerilee says: "Am I wearing a wedding veil?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Cheerilee says: "Are you sitting on a feather bed in a hole in the ground?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Cheerilee says: "Girls!"
Cheerilee says: "Can you explain why I look like I'm getting married at the bottom of a pit?"
Sweetie Belle says: "We may have given you the teeny-tiniest bit of love potion..."
Sweetie Belle says: "that may have turned out to actually be a love poison, and you may have gone just a teeny-tiniest bit nutty."
Apple Bloom says: "But we only did it because we thought you and Big Mac would be really happy if you could be each others very special someponies on Hearts and Hooves Day."
Scootaloo says: "Our hearts and hooves were in the right place."
Apple Bloom says: "But no matter how good our intentions might have been, we shoulda never meddled in your relationship."
Scootaloo says: "Nopony can force two ponies to be together."
Sweetie Belle says: "It's up to everypony to choose that very special somepony for themselves."
Apple Bloom says: "We're sorry."
Scootaloo says: "We're sorry."
Sweetie Belle says: "We're sorry."
Cheerilee says: "And you can think about how sorry you are while you're doing all of Big Mac's chores at Sweet Apple Acres."
Cheerilee says: "Does that seem like a fair punishment to you?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup."
Apple Bloom says: "Hey there, Miss Cheerilee!"
Apple Bloom says: "What are you doin' here?"
Cheerilee says: "Since you three are doing all of his chores, Big Mac and I thought we'd have a picnic at the gazebo."
Cheerilee says: "Ready, sugar bear?"
Big McIntosh says: "Eeyup, pumpkin pie."
Apple Bloom says: "NOOOOO!!!"
Scootaloo says: "NOOOOO!!!"
Sweetie Belle says: "NOOOOO!!!"
