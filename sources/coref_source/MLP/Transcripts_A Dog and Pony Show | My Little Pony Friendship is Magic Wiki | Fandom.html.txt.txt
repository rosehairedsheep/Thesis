Rarity says: "y-y-you know my name?"
Sapphire Shores says: "Well, of course I do, darling."
Sapphire Shores says: "I make it a point to know all of the up-and-coming designers and Clothes Horse magazine simply raved about you."
Rarity says: "Oh my stars."
Rarity says: "If I'm dreaming, do not wake me up."
Rarity says: "How may I help you, Miss Shores?"
Sapphire Shores says: "Oh please, call me Sapphire."
Rarity says: "How may I help you, Sapphire?"
Sapphire Shores says: "Well, as I'm sure you know, I'll be touring all of Equestria with my latest concert, Sapphire Shores' Ziegfilly Follies, so I need to look seeensational!"
Sapphire Shores says: "Ow!"
Rarity says: "I have just what you need."
Rarity says: "Sapphire Shores, prepare yourself for the pièce de résistance de la haute couture."
Rarity says: "I used every last diamond I found on this one garment."
Sapphire Shores says: "And it is spectacular!"
Sapphire Shores says: "I'll take it."
Rarity says: "Really?"
Sapphire Shores says: "Oh yes, and five more, each done up in a different jewel."
Rarity says: "Beg pardon?"
Sapphire Shores says: "Costume changes."
Sapphire Shores says: "Yes, I do have that effect on ponies."
Spike says: "Oh my gosh!"
Spike says: "Sapphire Shores!"
Spike says: "The pony of pop!"
Spike says: "She is awesome!"
Spike says: "I mean, she's gorgeous and talented and—"
Spike says: "heh..."
Spike says: "and not even half the pony you are."
Spike says: "I mean, you're ten times more gorgeous and talented and—"
Rarity says: "Spike, a lady is never jealous."
Spike says: "Eh, of course not."
Spike says: "But were you totally flipping out or what?!"
Spike says: "!"
Rarity says: "Ladies do not "flip out", Spike."
Rarity says: "However, I was quite in awe."
Rarity says: "Oh, I need to find more jewels than ever before to decorate her costumes."
Rarity says: "Oh, aha!"
Spike says: "Did you find some?"
Rarity says: "Yes, Spike!"
Rarity says: "Right there!"
Spike says: "Ooooo!"
Spike says: "You look so delicious..."
Rarity says: "Spike!"
Rarity says: "I promised I'd give you gems to snack on, but we need to collect more first or I'll never be able to make these outfits for Sapphire."
Spike says: "Hm..."
Spike says: "I will miss you, my sweets."
Rarity says: "Come along, Spike."
Rarity says: "We have many jewels to find."
Spike says: "At your service, milady."
Rarity says: "Spike!"
Rarity says: "You've been very patient today, Spike."
Rarity says: "And for that you get the finest reward."
Rarity says: "This is from me to you."
Rarity says: "Is something wrong, Spike?"
Spike says: "No."
Spike says: "It's perfect."

Rover says: "Wait!"
Rover says: "Who is that?"
Rarity says: "You know, it's terrible to keep a lady waiting."
Spike says: "Coming!"
Rarity says: "I think we're really going to strike gold this time."
Rarity says: "So to speak."
Spike says: "Jackpot!"
Rover says: "Oh, it's not the dragon we want."
Rover says: "It's the pony!"
Diamond Dogs says: "The pony..."
Rarity says: "Well, Spike, I think that's all we can do for today."

Spike says: "Ehe..."
Rarity says: "And you are..."
Rover says: "A Diamond Dog."
Rarity says: "Oh really?"
Rarity says: "Oh well, that explains your fine taste in jewelry."
Rarity says: "I mean I-I-I know that diamonds are a girl's best friend and now I know that they're a dog's best friend too, ha ha ha."
Rarity says: "So, um,  you're out hunting for gems as well?"
Rover says: "Yes."
Rover says: "We hunt."
Rarity says: "Uh..."
Rarity says: "we?"

Spike says: "Save her!"
Applejack says: "Not a whole lot to go on there, sport."
Spike says: "Sorry."
Spike says: "Rarity and I were in the woods looking for jewels when these creepy guys showed up."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Creepy guys?"
Spike says: "They called themselves the Diamond Dogs."
Spike says: "They grabbed Rarity and disappeared down a hole in the ground."
Applejack says: "Well, this sounds mighty easy."
Applejack says: "Just take us to that there hole and we'll save Rarity."
Pinkie Pie says: "Holy moly, that's a lotta holeys."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Come on, girls!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Let's get started."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Hello?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Puh!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Yuck!"

Fluttershy says: "Oh!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh my."
Fluttershy says: "Oh, oh!"
Applejack says: "We can't muscle through it!"
Rainbow Dash says: "We'll see about that."
Applejack says: "Whew."
Applejack says: "Heavens to Betsy."
Applejack says: "Now I'm used to pickin' myself up and dustin' myself off, but Rarity won't even touch mud 'less it's imported."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh, Rarity..."
Rarity says: "Oh, woe is me!"
Rarity says: "Whatever shall I do?"
Rarity says: "Ah!"
Rarity says: "Dirt, dirt!"
Rarity says: "Get away, dirt!"
Rarity says: "Oh!"
Rarity says: "Make it stop, make it stop!"
Rarity says: "Ah!"
Rarity says: "Filthy, disgusting dirt."
Rarity says: "It stings, it burns."
Rarity says: "Help!"
Rarity says: "Oh, somepony save me, save me!"
Applejack says: "We gotta save her."
Fluttershy says: "But they blocked up all the holes."
Applejack says: "Don't mean we can't dig 'em out."
Applejack says: "Come on!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ow!"
Fluttershy says: "Oof!"
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "Oof!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Get 'em!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whoooaaa!"

Spike says: "I'll save you, my sweet."
Main cast sans Rarity says: "Huh?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Spike, it is very noble of you..."
Spike says: "Shhh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "to sacrifice the gem Rarity gave you."
Spike says: "Oh, Lady Rarity."
Spike says: "My damsel in distress."
Sir Spike says: "I shall save you."
Sir Spike says: "Show yourselves, you dogs!"
Sir Spike says: "You curs!"
Sir Spike says: "Ah."
Sir Spike says: "There you are, you mangy mutts."
Rover says: "Who are you calling mutts?"
Rover says: "Unleash the hounds!"
Sir Spike says: "Now, where is Lady Rarity?"
Lady Rarity says: "Spike!"
Lady Rarity says: "I knew you would save me!"
Sir Spike says: "Nothing could stop me, milady."
Lady Rarity says: "Ohohohoh, Spike."
Lady Rarity says: "You are my..."
Lady Rarity says: "hero."
Sir Spike says: "Mmmmmm..."
Applejack says: "Hoho there, lover boy."
Spike says: "Whoa!"
Spike says: "Whoa whoa whoawhoawhoa..."
Spike says: "I got a bite!"
Spike says: "I got a bite!"
Applejack says: "Hold on there, little fella."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Applejack!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Twilight!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh my goodness, oh my goodness..."
Pinkie Pie says: "Wait for me!"
Fluttershy says: "Oh!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whee!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Whee!"
Pinkie Pie says: "Ha, ha, ha!"
Spike says: "Oh, oh!"
Spike says: "Ha ha, it worked!"
Spike says: "We're in!"
Spike says: "Now we can finally save Rarity!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Um..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "which way do we go?"
Spike says: "Nooooooooooo!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "All these tunnels..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "how are we ever gonna find Rarity?"
Applejack says: "Guess we're just gonna have to start going down them one by one."
Rainbow Dash says: "That could take forever!"
Rainbow Dash says: "There's gotta be way to narrow it down."
Spike says: "I know!"
Spike says: "I bet they've taken Rarity down the tunnel with the most gems."
Twilight Sparkle says: "But Spike, Rarity is the only one who knows how to find gems."
Spike says: "No, Twilight."
Spike says: "You can!"
Spike says: "You can copy Rarity's gem-finding spell."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Oh my gosh!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "You're right!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Rarity showed me how she did it a while back."
Twilight Sparkle says: "If I can just remember..."
Spike says: "That's it."
Spike says: "You did it, Twilight!"
Spike says: "Come on!"
Spike says: "We're coming, Rarity."
Spike says: "We'll save you."
Spike says: "Just hold on."
Rarity says: "Oh please, Diamond Dogs."
Rarity says: "Please let me go."
Spot says: "No!"
Fido says: "You're our precious little pony."
Rover says: "Forever!"
Rover says: "Muhahahaha!"
Rarity says: "But whatever do you want from me?"
Rover says: "Gemsss!"
Spot says: "Yes!"
Spot says: "The gems."
Spot says: "The jewels."
Fido says: "Find them!"
Fido says: "Find them all!"
Rarity says: "Oh!"
Rarity says: "Is that all?"
Rarity says: "There."
Rarity says: "A lovely pocket of jewels are right there."
Rarity says: "Now, if you'd be so kind as to show me the exit?"
Rover says: "Good!"
Rover says: "Now, dig them up, pony."
Rarity says: "What?"
Rarity says: "But you said you wanted me to find the gems."
Spot says: "Yes!"
Spot says: "Find and then dig."
Rarity says: "Dig?"
Fido says: "Yes."
Fido says: "Dig."
Rarity says: "Ohh..."
Fido says: "What are you doing?"
Fido says: "We said dig!"
Rarity says: "Forgive me, but prior to you so rudely dragging me into your dirt pit, I had a pony-pedi and I am not about to chip a hoof because you dislike my style of digging."
Rover says: "Oh, for goodness—"
Rover says: "Fine!"
Rover says: "Just stop."
Rover says: "Stop!"
Rover says: "Dig, dogs!"
Rover says: "Dig!"
Rover says: "And fast."
Fido says: "She won't dig, she pulls."
Rarity says: "I beg your pardon, but what, pray tell, are you doing?"
Fido says: "Others will dig."
Fido says: "You will haul the wagon."
Spot says: "Prrrecious pony-pedi will be preserved."
Rarity says: "Well, somebody certainly needs proper nail care."
Rarity says: "When was the last time you two had a manicure?"
Rarity says: "You're scratching up my coat with those jagged things!"
Rover says: "Please be quiet!"
Rarity says: "Good heavens, what is that smell?"
Rover says: "Smeeeeeell?"
Rarity says: "Ah, mystery solved."
Rarity says: "It's your breath."
Rover says: "Enough!"
Rover says: "Search, pony!"
Rarity says: "Well, since you insist..."
Rarity says: "but I must say the working conditions in here are simply dreadful."
Rarity says: "Musty and damp, it's going to wreak havoc on my mane."
Rarity says: "And this air is stifling, suffocating."
Rarity says: "And when I try to take a deep breath, the stench of all you dogs makes me nauseated."
Rarity says: "You look and smell like you haven't bathed in weeks."
Rarity says: "Have you never heard of soap?"
Rarity says: "You could all do with a good round of soap and water."
Rarity says: "Oh water, oh water, I'm terribly thirsty."
Rarity says: "Could I please have some water?"
Spot says: "Good gracious, I can't take this anymore."
Spot says: "Be quiet, pony!"
Rarity says: "And that's another thing."
Rarity says: "I would appreciate if you stopped calling me "pony"."
Rarity says: "I am a lady and I wish to be addressed as such."
Rarity says: "So you may call me "Miss" or "Rarity" or "Miss Rarity"."
Rover says: "Enough!"
Rover says: "Your whining!"
Rover says: "It-it-it hurts!"
Rarity says: "Whining?"
Rarity says: "I am not whining."
Rarity says: "I am complaining."
Rarity says: "Do you want to hear whining?"
Rarity says: "Thiiis iiis whiiining!"
Rarity says: "Oooh, this harness is too tiiight!"
Rarity says: "It's going to chafe."
Rarity says: "Can't you loosen it?"
Rarity says: "Oooh, it hurts and it's sooo ruuusty!"
Rarity says: "Why didn't you clean it first?"
Rarity says: "It's gonna leave a staaain!"
Rarity says: "And the wagon's getting heeeavy, why do I have to pull it?!"
Rarity says: "!"
Spot says: "Aaah!"
Spot says: "Make it stop!"
Rover says: "Stop whining!"
Rarity says: "But I thought you wanted whiiining!"
Rover says: "Geh!"
Rover says: "We'll do anything, pony!"
Rover says: "Oh, uh, uh, we'll do anything, "Miss Rarity"."
Rarity says: "Anything?"
Rarity says: "This water is hardly sparkling."
Rarity says: "But I suppose it will have to do."
Rover says: "Wait!"
Rover says: "Why are we doing this?"
Spot says: "To stop the awful noises from the pony's mouth, remember?"
Rover says: "Yes, yes, I know."
Rover says: "This is ridiculous!"
Rover says: "Letting a pony order us around."
Rover says: "What are we?"
Rover says: "Mice or dogs?"
Fido says: "Mi..."
Spot says: "Mi..."
Fido says: "dogs?"
Spot says: "dogs?"
Rover says: "Dogs do not pull."
Rover says: "Ponies pull."
Rover says: "Let her make the awful noises."
Rarity says: "What are you doing?"
Rarity says: "Hey, you spilled my drink."
Rarity says: "Oh!"
Rarity says: "Not sooo tiiight!"
Rover says: "Ha!"
Rover says: "Make the noises all you want."
Rover says: "But move while you make them."
Rover says: "Hyah, mule!"
Rarity says: "Did you just call me a..."
Rarity says: "mule?"
Rover says: "Ehh..."
Rarity says: "Mules are ugly."
Rarity says: "Are you saying that I too am ugly?"
Spot says: "What are these noises?"
Rarity says: "He called me ugly!"
Rover says: "No!"
Rover says: "Mule!"
Rover says: "I said mule!"
Rarity says: "An old ugly mule!"
Rarity says: "And it's true!"
Rarity says: "Just look at me."
Rarity says: "I used to be beautiful, but, but nooow..."
Fido says: "No, no!"
Fido says: "You're still beautiful, po..."
Fido says: "uh, Miss Rarity."
Rarity says: "You're just saying that!"
Spot says: "No, you're still pretty and..."
Spot says: "and..."
Rover says: "Oh, uh, uh, nice."
Rover says: "Yeah."
Rarity says: "I don't believe you!"
Rarity says: "You never liked me!"
Rover says: "Oh, I've had just about enough of this!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "We're getting close."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can feel it."
Spike says: "It's coming from down here."
Spike says: "Come on!"
Rainbow Dash says: "She must be in there."
Rainbow Dash says: "Let's go!"
Mook dog says: "More workhorses."
Applejack says: "Hoh, doggies."
Applejack says: "If you can take this bull by the horns, you better be ready for a ride."
Applejack says: "Come on, ponies!"
Applejack says: "Kick 'em up, kick 'em out."
Applejack says: "Buck 'em up, buck 'em down."
Applejack says: "Yeehaw!"
Applejack says: "Get along, little doggies!"
Spike says: "I'm coming for you, milady."
Spike says: "Hi-ho, Twilight!"
Spike says: "Away!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "And just what do you think you're doing?"
Spike says: "Please, Twilight."
Spike says: "Just give me this."
Twilight Sparkle says: "Eh..."
Twilight Sparkle says: "fine."
Spike says: "Lady Rarity, I'm here to save you!"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Excuse me?"
Spot says: "So picky."
Fido says: "And critical."
Spot says: "She won't stop talking."
Fido says: "And crying."
Rover says: "We, uh, give her back."
Rover says: "Yes."
Spike says: "Rarity!"
Spike says: "You're safe!"
Rarity says: "Why, yes."
Rarity says: "Hello, girls."
Rarity says: "You arrived just in time to assist me."
Applejack says: "Assist you with what?"
Rarity says: "With those."
Spike says: "You're letting her leave with all these..."
Spike says: "jewels?"
Rover says: "Yes."
Rover says: "Take them."
Rover says: "And her with them."
Spot says: "Please!"
Pinkie Pie says: "I can't believe you found all these gems!"
Rainbow Dash says: "Heh."
Rainbow Dash says: "I can't believe you tricked all those dogs."
Rarity says: "Just because I'm a lady doesn't mean I cannot handle myself in a sticky situation."
Rarity says: "I had them wrapped around my hoof the entire time."
Twilight Sparkle says: "I can't wait to write to Princess Celestia to tell her what you taught me today."
Rarity says: "Me?"
Rarity says: "What did I teach you?"
Twilight Sparkle says: "Just because somepony is ladylike doesn't make her weak."
Twilight Sparkle says: "In fact, by using her wits, a seemingly defenseless pony can be the one who outsmarts and outshines them all."
Spike says: "Hm..."
Spike says: ""outshines" is right."
Spike says: "Now you have enough gems to cover Sapphire Shores' costumes."
Rarity says: "Not if you eat them all, Spike."
