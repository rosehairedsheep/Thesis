Jerry says: "Why am I so mediocre?"
Beth takes a stand, tears a pipe off of a rack, and grabs Jerry off the ground.
Beth says: "Jerry, turn around."
Beth says: "Straighten your back."
Beth says: "Bend your knees."
Beth says: "Bend them."
Beth says: "Square your shoulders."
Beth says: "Take a deep breath."
Beth says: "I love you."
Meeseeks says: "I'm counting to three, Jerry."
Jerry opens the door, as everyone watches. Using the pipe, he swings at a tomato. It lands into a pot.
All Meeseeks says: "Ooooohhh!"
Samantha says: "What the fuck is going on?"
All Meeseeks says: "He's got it!"
All Meeseeks says: "That's a lower handicap stro-o-ke!"
All the Meeseeks stop existing except 1.
Meeseeks says: "Excuse me."
Meeseeks says: "I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks."
Meeseeks says: "What about your short game?"
The meeseeks grabs Samantha and puts a knife up to her neck.
Samantha says: "Oh, my God, oh, my God!"
Jerry grabs an onion and puts it on the ground. He swings the pipe again, and it rolls.
Meeseeks says: "Ooh, nice!"
Jerry says: "I think we'll take our food to go."
Owner says: "No, you won't."
Owner says: "The police are coming."
Owner says: "You have so many questions to answer."
Jerry says: "Fair enough."
Rick and Morty return to the village in triumph.
The First Villager says: "Thank you, kind sir."
The First Villager says: "Our village is saved!"
The First Villager says: "You are both true heroes!"
Rick says: "Good job, Morty."
Rick says: "Looks like you won the bet."
Morty says: "Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should."
Morty says: "You know, you were right about the universe."
Morty says: "It's a crazy and chaotic place."
Rick says: "Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know."
Rick says: "This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style."
The First Villager says: "Oh!"
The First Villager says: "Heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved king so that he may thank you personally."
The badly beaten Mr. Jelly Bean is carried to towards them on a thrown.
Morty says: "Uh, no, I-it's cool."
Morty says: "Rick."
Morty says: "Portal."
Morty says: "Hurry."
They portal away, but Rick makes another portal back and sticks an energy pistol through it and shoots Mr. Jelly Bean, splattering him all over the screaming villagers.
Back at the Smith house.
Jerry says: "So..."
Jerry says: "You still thinking about taking that trip?"
Beth says: "Jerry, look."
Beth says: "We don't have a perfect marriage, but I'm not going anywhere."
Beth says: "When we were in that freezer, I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with willing to say anything to "complete their task."
Jerry says: "Was I one of those guys?"
Beth says: "The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards."
Jerry says: "Well..."
Jerry says: "I got you pregnant."
Beth says: "Yeah..."
Rick says: "What the hell happened to this place?"
Beth says: "Uh, your Meeseeks box happened."
Beth says: "They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game."
Beth says: "He felt terrible."
Rick says: "Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot."
Beth says: "Dad!"
Beth says: "Is there anything you can do to clean this place up?"
Rick says: "Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box."
Jerry says: "No."
Jerry says: "No more boxes."
Rick says: "What?"
Rick says: "It just has a mop and some floor wax in it."
Rick says: "Wubba lubba dub dub!"
Rick says: "Yeah!"
Rick says: "That's my new thing!"
Rick says: "I'm kind of like what's his name Arsenio."
Rick says: "Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show."
Rick says: "Wobble gobba lop bops!"
Rick says: "Right?"
Rick says: "See you next week, everybody."
Beth says: "I don't get it."
After the end credits at the village.
Villager 1 says: "Sir, I think you're going to want to see this."
Villager 1 says: "We found it inside a lockbox inside king Jelly Bean's closet."
Villager 1 says: "We have to tell the people."
Villager 2 says: "Wait."
Villager 2 says: "Destroy it."
Our people will get more from the idea he represented... than from the jelly bean he actually was.
They stare and walk away from a statue of Mr. Jelly Bean standing next to a young boy with his hand on his shoulder.
