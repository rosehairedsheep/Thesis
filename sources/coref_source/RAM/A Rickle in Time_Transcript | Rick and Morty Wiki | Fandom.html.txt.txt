Morty, Rick, and Jerry.
Everything is frozen besides Morty, Rick and Summer. Morty is vacuuming Jerry with a hand vac.
Summer says: "Hurry up Morty, Grampa's about to unfreeze time."
Summer says: "You know you really should be cleaning from top to bottom."
Morty says: "I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, I've been doing it for six months!"
Summer says: "Then you've been doing it wrong for six months."
Summer says: "Oh, my God, is that mildew?"
Morty says: "It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day!"
Summer says: "You have dropped so many balls, man."
Summer says: "Do you ever get scared Grampa Rick might make me his new sidekick?"
Morty says: "What?"
Morty says: "What kind of monster are you?"
Summer says: "A competent one."
Rick says: "Who cares about the *belch* thing you guys are talking about?"
Rick says: "The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck."
Rick says: "Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling."
Rick says: "Let's do this thing."
Morty puts shirt on Jerry backwards.
Rick says: "Alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize."
Morty says: "Our time is gonna be unstable?"
Morty says: "What does that even mean?"
Rick says: "It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty."
Rick says: "I thought you learned that by now."
Rick says: "It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards."
Morty says: "Wait a minute, what?"
Rick says: "And away we go!"
Rick unfreezes time.
Mr. Benson falls off the roof.
Morty says: "Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr."
Morty says: "Benson?"
Rick says: "Shhh, Morty!"
Jerry opens the door angrily.
Jerry says: "..."
Jerry says: "A THING OR TWO ABOUT..."
Jerry says: "wait, what?"
Jerry says: "Was the house..."
Jerry says: "?"
Jerry says: "When we pulled up I could have sworn the house was completely trashed."
Rick says: "Negative visualization, Jerry."
Rick says: "It explains a lot about where you're at."
Rick says: "Hi, sweety."
Beth says: "Hi, dad."
Summer and Morty recoil from Beth as she approaches to hug Rick.
Beth says: "Summer, Morty, are you okay?"
Morty says: "W-We just missed you a lot."
Summer says: "Yeah, we missed you so much."
Summer says: "Too much to hug you though."
Rick motions Summer and Morty behind him.
Rick says: "Yeah it would literally destroy them."
Rick says: "Now listen, why do—"
Rick says: "why do—"
Rick says: "why—"
Rick says: "why don't you guys go get a free Sundae ice cream,  go out there and get some ice creams."
Rick says: "Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys."
Rick says: "I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya."
Rick says: "You guys go nuts."
Jerry says: "This better not be a bribe."
Jerry says: "If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you."
Jerry says: "I'll get my jacket."
Beth says: "Sweety, is your shirt on backwards?"
Morty says: "Oh!"
Rick says: "Uh oh."
Jerry says: "Yeah, I like it this way."
Jerry says: "I'm not stupid."
Morty says: "Phew..."
Rick says: "Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on."
Rick says: "Well guess what?"
Rick says: "I made him up."
Rick says: "You really are your father's children."
Rick says: "Think for yourselves, don't be sheep."

Time splits into two - alternate timelines will be ordered from top to bottom, left to right.
Both Ricks says: "Oh God, oh no, what did you guys just do?"
Summer 1 says: "What do you mean?"
Summer 2 says: "What could we do?"
BothAll Summers says: "Wait, what am I saying?"
Both Rick says: "*belch* Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?"
BothAll Mortys says: "Oh man..."
BothAll Mortys says: "I don't feel good."
Morty 1 says: "Am I me?"
Morty 1 says: "I think so."

BothAll Summers says: "What's happening Grampa?"
BothAll Ricks says: "Shut up!"
BothAll Ricks says: "Oh crap are you kidding me?"
BothAll Ricks says: "Two dots?"
BothAll Ricks says: "This never needs to be more than one dot."
BothAll Ricks says: "The two of you made us uncertain!"
Morty 1 says: "What do you mean?"
Morty 2 says: "What?"
Morty 2 says: "In English?"
Summer 1 says: "What?"
Summer 1 says: "English please?"
Summer 2 says: "What are you talking about?"
BothAll Ricks says: "Our time is fractured."
BothAll Ricks says: "You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that's split our reality into two equally possible impossibilities."
BothAll Ricks says: "W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker."
BothAll Ricks says: "We're entirely hypothetical."
BothAll Mortys says: "But I thought there were infinite timelines."
BothAll Ricks says: "We're not on any timeline, dummy."
BothAll Ricks says: "Look."
Rick opens the garage door, revealing floating cats, trees and islands.
BothAll Mortys says: "Oh, my God!"
BothAll Summers says: "Are those cats?"
Both Ricks says: "I assume they're Schrödinger's cats."
Both Ricks says: "A-actually, I assume they both are and aren't, just like us."
Summer 1 says: "Is the world gone?"
Morty 2 says: "Is the world gone?"
Summer 1 says: "Where are Mom and Dad?"
Morty 2 says: "Where are Mom and Dad?"
Both Ricks says: "“Mom and Dad?"
Both Ricks says: "” Get your head out of your family's ass."
Both Ricks says: "The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion."
Both Ricks says: "Your parents get to exist."
Both Ricks says: "They're probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their shitty marriage."
Trans. Inside Jerry's car.
Jerry says: "Cold Stone Creamery is the best."
Jerry says: "What should we do with our remaining twenty dollars?"
Beth says: "You realize they sing no matter how much you tip."
Jerrry hits a deer.
Beth says: "Holy shit!"
Beth says: "What happened?"
Jerry says: "I hit a deer!"
Jerry says: "W-we have to tell the cops you were driving."
Beth says: "W-what?"
Jerry says: "This is Rum Raisin!"
Beth hands Jerry her ice cream, gets out of the car and goes over to the deer.
Beth says: "It's still alive."
Jerry says: "Well, do we- do I uh, get a big rock?"
Beth says: "It's not an armadillo, asshole!"
Jerry says: "I thought that's what a man's supposed to say, it's not like I could have actually done it."
Jerry says: "It's okay, this is just something that happens."
Jerry says: "And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do, you're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon."
Beth says: "So..."
Beth says: "Require different levels of skill to keep alive?"
Jerry says: "Oh God..."
Beth says: "Get the deer in the car, Jerry."
Jerry says: "Yes Beth."
Trans. Inside Rick's garage.
Both Ricks says: "This is why you don't freeze time, you guys."
Both Ricks says: "It's incredibly irresponsible."
Morty 1 says: "And you did it so you could clean the house after a party."
Morty 2 says: "And you did it so you could clean the house after a party?"
Both Ricks says: "Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, Morty."
Both Ricks says: "Like literally no time."
Both Ricks says: "Look around."
Both Ricks says: "Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable."
Both Ricks says: "Eventually everything either is or isn't."
Both Ricks says: "And we've got about four hours to be “is”."
Morty 1 says: "Or..."
Morty 2 says: "Or?"
Both Ricks says: "We “isn't”."
Both Ricks says: "Alright, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this, I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time."
Both Ricks says: "Whatever you're asking, the answer is I'm amazing."
Both Ricks says: "And away we go!"
Rick presses a button, the timelines almost merge.
Both Ricks says: "Huh, what do you know, it's working."
Summer 1 says: "Ow, ow ouch!"
Morty 2 says: "Whoa, ow, ow."
Both Ricks says: "Oh shit."
Realities separate again.
All Ricks says: "What the hell is wrong with you two!"

All Ricks says: "I m—"
All Ricks says: "I mean you four!"
All Ricks says: "?"
All Mortys says: "That hurt!"
Summer 2 says: "That hurt!"
All Mortys says: "That was painful..."
Summer 2 says: "That was painful..."
All Ricks says: "Good I'm glad it was painful."
All Ricks says: "You do deserve it!"
All Ricks says: "I saw you, you're both *belch* all over the damn place."
All Ricks says: "We've been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum fucking wind?"
All Ricks says: "What the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about?"
All Ricks says: "Your brand of zit cream?"
All Ricks says: "Which chair to sit in while I do everything?"
All Ricks says: "Come on, spit it out!"
All Mortys says: "Well you don't exactly make it easy, Rick!"
Morty 1 says: "You make fun of me all the time and now Summer's doing it too!"
Morty 2 says: "You're always picking on me and now you got someone to kiss your ass!"
Summer 1 says: "Me?"
Summer 1 says: "What about you?"
Summer 1 says: "Would you get more excited to see me fail?"
Summer 1 says: "You want Grampa all to yourself!"
Summer 2 says: "Me?"
Summer 2 says: "You're just as mean to me because you're jealous, because you want Grampa all to yourself!"
All Ricks says: "Alright, cool it, I see what's happening here."
All Ricks says: "You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, you both wanna be “Grampa's favorite."
All Ricks says: "” I can fix this."
All Ricks says: "Morty sit here, Summer, you sit here."
All Ricks says: "Now listen, I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grampa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit."
All Ricks says: "Yeah, I can prove it mathematically."
All Ricks says: "Actually, let me grab my whiteboard."
All Ricks says: "This has been a long time coming anyway."

Trans. Inside animal hospital operating room.
Vet is taking a snake's pulse.
Vet says: "Three."
Vet says: "Excuse me, you can't be back here."
Beth says: "I'm a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention."
Beth says: "Nurse, please move that snake."
Beth says: "As a vet, I'm sure you know a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor, so let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out, it's time to save a life!"
Vet says: "Geez..."
Vet removes Snake from operating table. Beth and Jerry place deer on operating table.
Beth says: "That's odd, this deer's wounded."
Jerry says: "Uh, yeah, I was there, you don't have to rub it in."
Beth says: "I mean it's been shot."
Beth says: "With a gun."
Hunter says: "My gun."
Vet says: "May I help you, sir?"
Hunter says: "No, but you can stop helping this deer."
Hunter says: "I shot it before these two hit it with their car and I followed them when they hauled it off."
Hunter says: "This deer belongs to me."
Vet says: "Look, I don't know what the law says about this, but I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm."
Vet says: "Except when sterilizing, aborting or euthenizing them and also when eating them at almost any meal."
Hunter says: "I'm calling my lawyer."
Hunter says: "I hope for all our sakes you're as bad a surgeon as I am a hunter."
Beth says: "In your dreams, bitch!"
Beth says: "Scalpel!"
Trans. Inside Rick's garage.
All Ricks says: "So in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi."
All Ricks says: "And I honestly can't tell the two of you half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical."
All Ricks says: "Alright, everything resolved?"
All Ricks says: "Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world?"
All Mortys says: "Yes."
All Summers says: "Yes."
All Ricks says: "Alright, perfect."
All Ricks says: "Sit still, *belch* arms down, I'm gonna do this again, this time, be like Grampa."
Morty 2 says: "You mean drunk?"
Rick 2 says: "What's that?"
Rick 2 says: "You got something to say?"
Rick 1 says: "And away we go!"
Morty 2 says: "No."
Rick 2 says: "And away we go!"
All Ricks says: "Huh, that's weird."
All Ricks says: "Oh, my God."
All Summers says: "What?"
All Ricks says: "That son of a bitch is gonna kill me!"
Rick 2 says: "Follicle unfeeling sociopath."
Rick 2 says: "Don't you get it?"
Rick 2 says: "He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me."
Rick 2 says: "He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them."
Rick 2 says: "I have to admit, it's always in the back of my mind too."
Rick 2 says: "The difference is I would never do it!"
Rick 2 says: "Until now..."
Rick 1 says: "Don't you get it?"
Rick 1 says: "don't you get it?"
Rick 1 says: "The other Rick isn't trying to merge us anymore."
Rick 1 says: "He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me."
Rick 1 says: "He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them."
Rick 1 says: "I have to admit, it's always in the back of my mind too."
Rick 1 says: "The difference is I would never do it!"
Rick 1 says: "Until now..."
All Mortys says: "Rick what the hell are you doing?"
All Ricks says: "Saving our lives."
All Ricks says: "After he takes me out he's gonna be coming for you!"
All Summers says: "Who?"
All Ricks says: "Me!"
Rick 2 says: "You see that?"
Rick 2 says: "Get down."
All Summers says: "Ahh!"
All Mortys says: "Whoa whoa!"
Rick 1 says: "I told you he's a psycho!"
Rick 2 says: "He's lost it."
Rick 2 says: "The time fracture must have made him crazy!"
Rick 1 says: "I don't know what to do!"
Rick 1 says: "I don't know what to do!"
Summer 2 or 4 after splitting into 4 says: "Oh crap!"
Reality splits into 4 parts.
All Ricks says: "Oh God, now there's three of them, we're outnumbered!"
All Ricks says: "Get in the cupboards!"
All Ricks says: "Wait, don't don't do that, they'll know..."
All Ricks says: "wait wait, think about getting in the cupboards but don't really."
All Ricks says: "AAAAH!"
All Ricks says: "IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT YOU SICK FUCKS?"
All Ricks says: "YOU WANNA SEE CHILDREN DIE?"
Trans. Inside animal hospital operating room.
Beth says: "You son of a bitch, you don't stop living until I SAY SO!"
Lawyer says: "Michael."
Vet says: "Who's this now?"
Hunter says: "My lawyer."
Lawyer says: "I'm here to notify you ma'am, that in this county, any deer shot by a hunter is that hunter's property, regardless of how far it runs, or who intercepts it before it dies."
Lawyer says: "It's called Brad's law."
Lawyer says: "We can't make you stop the surgery, but at this point you're performing it on venison."
Hunter says: "Actually, I've decided not to eat it."
Hunter says: "All this fear and conflict."
Hunter says: "I'm sure it's ruined the meat."
Hunter says: "I'm just gonna use the head for my rec room wall."
Jerry says: "She normally works on horses."
Beth says: "Jerry, if you're not gonna help, get the fuck out of here!"
Beth says: "I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back!"
Vet says: "Jesus..."
Trans. Inside Rick's garage.
All Ricks says: "Shh shh..."
All Ricks says: "I know where you are, you creepy old monster..."
All Ricks says: "I know how you think!"
All Ricks says: "Oh, is this where you think I'm going?"
All Ricks says: "You think I'm standing here?"
All Ricks says: "Well maybe you're right!"
Morty knocks Rick out with a fire extinguisher.
All Summers says: "Holy shit, now what?"
All Mortys says: "Well if all of me knocked out all the Ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn't that mean that we're all synchronized?"
All Summers says: "Right."
All Mortys says: "Okay..."
All Mortys says: "so from now on, whatever we do we have to be certain."
All Summers says: "Right..."
All Mortys says: "I think I'm certain we're F'd in the A."
Cut to black.
Trans. Outside the house in Schrodinger cat space.
All Ricks says: "Oh God, my head."
All Ricks says: "What did you guys do?"
All Mortys says: "We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture."
All Summers says: "You tried to kill yourself!"
All Ricks says: "Only in self defense, myself tried to kill me first!"
All Ricks says: "Guys, I don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it."
All Ricks says: "Well actually, I do expect you to understand that, it's basic math."
All Ricks says: "C-could someone just let me out of here?"
All Ricks says: "If I die in a cage I lose a bet."
All Summers says: "Well is there some way you can prove you're not a threat to yourself and others anymore?"
All Ricks says: "Ah, for God's sake, alright here, give me the time crystal."
All Mortys says: "W-what're you doing?"
All Ricks says: "Calling myself."
All Ricks says: "Here, listen, *belch* it'll probably go to voice mail since, you know, I'm calling myself."
All Rick phones says: "Hello, Rick here."
All Ricks says: "Don't fall for it, it's a bit."
All Rick phones says: "Just kidding, haha!"
All Rick phones says: "You just got Ricked."
All Rick phones says: "You've reached Rick's voicemail, you know what to do *beep*."
All Ricks says: "Hey Rick, it's Rick."
All Ricks says: "Listen, I'm sorry about earlier."
All Ricks says: "No hard feelings."
All Ricks says: "I know you know I mean it too."
All Ricks says: "Take it easy."
All Ricks says: "Whoa."
All Ricks says: "Damn, look at this, I'm blown up."
All Ricks says: "Three new voicemails."
All Ricks says: "*voicemail repeats* Yeah yeah, I heard this one."
All Ricks says: "*voicemail repeats two more times* You get the idea *belch* we're cool now."
All Summers says: "Okay, well we're still not gonna let you out of this crate."
All Ricks says: "Fine I'll just do it myself."
All Mortys says: "If you could get out that whole time why didn't you?"
All Ricks says: "Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty."
All Ricks says: "That's the difference between you and me."
All Ricks says: "I'm certain, and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds."
All Mortys says: "You know, geez Rick, y—"
All Mortys says: "y—"
All Mortys says: "you're really tearing into me right now."

3 says: "Uh, we did..."
Rick 4 says: "We're not wearing collars."
Testicle Monster A says: "Exactly, because you're being obstinate."
Rick 1 says: "*belch* What?"

Summer says: "Yes, we're back to our own time."
Morty says: "Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it."
Testicle Monster A says: "Yeah, now keep those collars on so you don't break your weak ass time again."
Rick says: "How long exactly do we have to wear these things?"
Rick says: "They're really embarrassing."
Testicle Monster A says: "Well since you're goin' to time prison, I'd say you can keep em on forever."
Summer says: "Time prison?"
Testicle Monster A says: "Yeah, well I don't know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there, but the only way you dumb ass, assin' ass asses could ever have one, is if it was stolen."
Summer says: "You stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters?"
Rick says: "I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco."
Rick says: "Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here."
Rick says: "Get him!"
Testicle Monster A says: "Ututututut!"
Testicle Monster A says: "You'd better keep back!"
Testicle Monster A says: "Man this will turn your ass into a third trimester fetus from 30 yards."

Beth says: "Isn't there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure?"
Lawyer says: "That's right Mrs."
Lawyer says: "Smith, *whispers* give in to your anger."
Lawyer says: "Neglect that deer."
Jerry says: "Honey, it's gonna be okay."
Jerry says: "These men are from the Cervine Institute of Elk, Moose Deer and Stag."
Jerry says: "They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country's top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border, where your jurisdiction ends."
Vet says: "I guess that's the end of that."
Lawyer says: "There is just one more thing."
Lawyer says: "According to this state's veterinarian statute, this animal can't be transferred until the current attending physician verbally confirms their inability to provide adequate care."
Lawyer says: "You heard the man horse doctor, you have to say you couldn't hack it."
Jerry says: "We did it..."

Testicle Monster A says: "You really think I'm that stupid?"

Rick says: "You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite."
