Open Ext. Rick's Ship in flying through a planet's rings.
Morty is in the backseat, Summer is in the starboard seat, Rick is driving.
All says: "Love."
All says: "Connection."
All says: "Experience."
Morty claps.
Rick says: "Oh yeah, distress beacon!"
Rick says: "Yeah baby!"
Morty says: "You're excited about that?"
Rick says: "The first rule of space travel kids, is always check out distress beacons; nine out of ten times its a ship full of dead aliens and a bunch of free shit!"
Rick makes a sharp turn.
Morty says: "Whoa!"
Summer says: "Whoa!"
Rick says: "One out of ten times its a deadly trap, but I'm ready to roll those dice!"
Trans. flying toward S.S. Independence.
Trans. Rick, Morty, and Summer entering corridor.
Summer says: "Seems like something terrible happened here."
Rick says: "Yeah."
Rick says: "Cha-ching."
Rick says: "Oh yeah, if you find a room full of eggs, don't shy away from it, give one of them a shake."
Rick says: "Those facehuggers are worth more than this ship."
Rick is spray-painting a symbol on a closed door.
Morty says: "Uh, what's that?"
Rick says: "This will make the cops write it up as a looting by the Korblocks."
Summer says: "That's horrible!"
Rick says: "I hear you man, cops are racist."
A door behind them opens with six crewmembers.
Rick says: "Oh, hey!"
Rick says: "You're alive!"
Rick says: "Thank God."
Female alien says: "Can you help us?"
Female alien says: "Our planet was taken over by some kind of  entity!"
Female alien says: "It absorbed the minds of our people!"
Male alien 1 says: "We didn't notice until it was too late."
Male alien 1 says: "The people it takes over, they look like your friends, your family, your leaders, but they're not, themselves any more; They're part of It."
Rick says: "And how do you know it didn't get on the ship with you?"
Rick says: "Those two ding-dongs seem pretty calm about the whole thing."
Two male aliens are calm and not panting and standing apart from the other four.
They screech after Rick points at them.
Male alien with glasses says: "Hey!"
Male alien with glasses says: "No, no- uurgh!"
Morty screams. The other four are assimilated.
Rick says: "Called it."
All six aliens together says: "Hello Rick."
All six aliens together says: "Long time no see."
Rick says: "Unity!"
Rick says: "?"
Morty says: "Rick?"
Summer says: "Grandpa?"
Rick says: "Oh boy."
Rick says: "Uh, these are my grandkids, Summer and Morty."
Rick says: "Summer, Morty, this is uh, Unity."
Rick says: "We sort of used to, uh, date."
Scene's of life on Unity's planet are shown; S.S. Independence lands.
Rick says: "Quite an operation you got going here Une."
Rick says: "You're a whole planet now huh?"
Unity says: "where I was better able to focus on my passion for unification."
Summer says: "You mean stealing peoples’ bodies?"
Rick says: "Summer, rude."
Rick says: "Why don't you kids run off and play with Unity while Unity and I do some catching up."
Summer says: "Ugh."
Morty says: "Wait!"
Morty says: "Rick, aren't these people going to barf into our mouths and absorb us?"
Unity says: "You're guests here on my planet, you're free to be yourselves; I've never been good at disappointing Rick."
Summer says: "Well now I'm going to barf."
Summer says: "Come on Morty."
Trans. to garage; Jerry is rooting through shelves.
Beth says: "Jerry, what are you- what are you doing in here?"
Jerry says: "I'm trying to find our weed whacker, ‘cause our weeds are wack, yo."
Beth says: "But you can't go in the garage when Rick's not here."
Jerry says: "I can't?"
Beth says: "Well, he doesn't like it."
Jerry says: "What's he gonna do, crash rent-free at his other family's house?"
Beth says: "What is that supposed to mean?"
Jerry stands up and turns to face Beth.
Jerry says: "Your dad gets to walk all over us because of your abandonment issues!"
Jerry says: "He's playing you, shorty."
Beth says: "Oh, stop affecting that stupid hip-hop dialect!"
Jerry says: "Stop shifting the crosshairs to my ironic urban patois just because your relationship with your father is toe-up from the flow-up."
Gurgling sounds come from below. Beth and Jerry look around.
Jerry says: "What the hell was that?"
Beth says: "I don't know, let's just leave!"
More gurgling. Jerry removes the mat to reveal a hatch in the floor.
Jerry says: "That is a hatch!"
Jerry says: "Your father put a hatch in my garage!"
Beth says: "You don't know it was him!"
Beth says: "Anyway, we’re not supposed to be in here!"
Jerry says: "Obviously, neither is whatever's gurgling down there."
Gurgling.
Rick says: "World peace achieved."
Rick says: "Nice!"
Rick says: "A little weird to publish a paper about it for yourself, but hey."
Rick says: "So what's next?"
Unity says: "After I become a type-one civilisation, this world will be invited into the Galactic Federation."
Rick says: "Oh, goody."
As Rick walks, Unity switches between people nearby to have a flawless conversation without having to stop what they’re doing.
Unity says: "From there I'll have access to countless planets and species."
Unity says: "One by one, I will unify them, I will become the universe, and I will be what the single-minded once called a god."
Rick says: "I like that."
Rick says: "Oh, that's pretty sexy."
Rick says: "Hey listen, where can I get a drink around here?"
Unity says: "Recreational substances were phased out here."
Unity says: "There's no need for escape from the self when your world is one."
Rick says: "Unity, Unity, who am I talking to?"
Rick says: "I watched you assimilate a whole police station just to get your hands on the evidence locker."
Unity says: "Rick, when we met I was a young hivemind with the population of a small town."
Unity says: "People..."
Unity says: "change."
Unity says: "Especially when I change them."
Unity says: "I'm sorry to disappoint you, but..."
Unity says: "I’ve grown."
Rick says: "Hey, listen, I’ve grown too."
Rick says: "I have!"
Rick says: "See, I’ve- I’ve reconnected with my family, right?"
Unity says: "Hm, why is that I wonder?"
Rick says: "Maybe it's part of getting old."
Rick says: "Maybe I just miss being with..."
Rick says: "a collective."
Rick and Unity start kissing. A crowd forms around them.
Unity says: "Yes Rick!"
Unity says: "Yes!"
Unity says: "Yes!"
Rick says: "Oh yeah!"
Unity says: "Yes!"
Unity says: "Yes!"
Rick says: "Wait, wait, stop!"
Rick says: "H-Hold it!"
Rick says: "Not like this."
Rick says: "We need a hang glider."
Rick says: "And a crotchless Uncle Sam costume."
Rick says: "And I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked redheads!"
Rick says: "And I want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father!"
Trans. to a mountain being carved into the shape of Morty and Summer’s heads. Morty and Summer are being fanned and eating hamburgers.
Morty says: "Look at ‘em go!"
Morty says: "So coordinated!"
Morty says: "What’s your problem?"
Morty says: "They’re making you into a Mount Rushmore!"
Morty says: "They made burgers!"
Summer says: "Morty, open your eyes!"
Summer says: "There is no they!"
Summer says: "These poor people's’ bodies are being used!"
Summer says: "They're a planet of puppets!"
Unity says: "I can hear you."
Summer says: "Ugh!"
Morty says: "Well, seems like everybody here's cool with it."
Morty says: "Except for all those redheads."
Morty says: "They seem like they're in a hurry to be somewhere else."
Unity says: "Balloon, Summer?"
Unity says: "Balloon, Morty?"
Summer says: "No, we don't want your dumb balloons."
Summer says: "We’re bored."
Summer says: "Take us back to Rick."
Unity says: "Now's..."
Unity says: "not a good time."
Trans. to Rick in a hang glider and Uncle Sam costume, flying towards a stadium.
Rick says: "Oh yeah!"
Rick says: "I want youuuuuu!"
Unity says: "Go son go!"
Unity says: "Go son go!"
Unity says: "Go son go!"
Jerry says: "Oh!"
Jerry says: "Real nice!"
Jerry says: "Real nice!"
Jerry says: "How does a man do this without me noticing?"
Beth says: "Oh, you know my dad."
Beth says: "Once he puts his mind to something..."
Jerry says: "You're spinning this to his credit?"
Gurgling.
Jerry says: "I'm going down there."
Beth says: "Jerry!"
Jerry says: "Beth, this is my house, which makes this my garage, my secret hatch, my hidden subterranean lair,  and my faceless gargler."
Jerry says: "Now, are you going to keep hating this playa, or are you gonna jack my steed?"
Beth says: "Okay, you're just making stuff up now."
Trans. to Rick, who’s walking out in a bathrobe, panting, to applause.
Rick says: "Oh my god."
Rick says: "Oh my god."
Unity says: "Oh Rick, it was so bad."
Rick says: "What's this ‘was’ stuff?"
Rick says: "I just need to hydrate and then we’re doing that again!"
Beta-7’s spaceships arrive from skyward.
Unity says: "Oh damn."
Rick says: "Listen, if this is an invasion I gotta sit this one out, but I'll- I'll be back to have sex with the survivors."
Unity says: "It's a neighboring hivemind species, Beta-7."
Unity says: "Our planet's maintained a practical alliance for exchange of vital resources."
Unity says: "So be nice!"
Beta-7 says: "Unity."
Beta-7 says: "Is it a..."
Beta-7 says: "bad time?"
Beta-7 says: "Are all..."
Beta-7 says: "present lifeforms..."
Beta-7 says: "assimilated?"
Unity says: "Beta-7, this is my single-minded friend from Earth, Rick."
Beta-7 says: "Rick..."
Beta-7 says: "Sanchez."
Beta-7 says: "Unity has spoken of you."
Rick says: "All bad I hope."
Rick laughs and puts his hand on the lead Beta-7’s shoulders. All Beta-7 assimilated scream and point at Rick.
Rick says: "Whoa, Jesus Christ!"
Unity says: "Beta-7, if my allies are a problem for you perhaps our alliance is as well."
Beta-7 says: "Our alliance is beneficial."
Beta-7 says: "When Beta-7 expresses concern it- it's only..."
Beta-7 says: "be-because..."
Rick says: "Oh snap!"
Rick says: "Powdered neutronium?"
Rick says: "Amphetetron?"
Rick says: "You know what I can make with this stuff?"
Unity says: "Oh..."
Unity says: "Rick, I- I shouldn't..."
Rick says: "Come on, it's not every day that I'm in town!"
Rick says: "It- it's for old time's sake."
Unity says: "Uh..."
Unity says: "Okay, what the hell!"
Unity says: "We can purify the resin and make fractal dust!"
Rick says: "Oh, I was thinking velocitinis, but..."
Unity says: "Aww, old man Rick can't party with the whole planet?"
Both laugh.
Rick says: "I can do whatever you do and more, baby."
Beta-7 says: "Hrmm..."
Beta-7 leaves.
Rick says: "You know, I think Beta-7 over there is hoping your alliance can be more than practical."
Both laugh.
Trans. To Rick’s underground lair. Jerry is searching with a flashlight.
Jerry says: "Well, this explains the six thousand dollar electric bill."
Both see Blim Blam chained up to a wall and yell.
Jerry says: "Well."
Jerry says: "Nice."
Jerry says: "Real nice."
Jerry says: "Alien prisoners under the house."
Jerry says: "Real nice."
Jerry says: "Nice."
Beth says: "Goddamn it, stop."
Trans. to Unity’s planet, Summer is in the street on a soapbox with a megaphone.
Summer says: "Wake up people!"
Summer says: "You have to fight it!"
Summer says: "You're under the spell of an evil monster!"
Unity says: "I can hear you."
Summer says: "Yeah!"
Summer says: "So you keep saying!"
She starts slapping the man.
Morty says: "Summer!"
Summer says: "Wake up!"
Summer says: "You have to have some individuality left in there!"
Unity says: "Why do you hate me, Summer?"
Summer says: "I'm not talking to you!"
Summer says: "I'm talking to..."
She reaches into his pocket and grabs his wallet, and flips over to his license.
Summer says: "..."
Summer says: "Steven Phillips!"
Summer says: "Steven!"
Summer says: "Set yourself free!"
Unity says: "Summer, before I took over this planet, this man was a registered sex offender."
Summer says: "..."
Summer says: "Yeah, well so what?"
Summer says: "At least he was himself."
Unity says: "This woman was a drug addict on the verge of suicide."
Unity says: "Now she's a marine biologist."
Morty says: "Listen Unity, I don't think my sister's trying to say that life would be perfect without you."
Morty says: "I think she's just saying that life would be..."
Morty says: "you know, life."
Unity says: "I have transformed life here into a paradise."
Unity says: "Prostitutes are now scientists."
Unity says: "The homeless are now phisosophers."
Summer says: "Oh, phi- phisosophers?"
Unity says: "Philophiluh..."
Unity says: "phiphophibup..."
Summer says: "Oh my god."
Summer says: "Where did you learn to talk you grandpa-stealing slut?"
Unity says: "I'm feeling..."
Unity says: "urk!"
The man falls down and vomits. All other assimilated in the area follow suit.
Morty says: "Oh man!"
Morty says: "Let me help all of you guys up!"
Unity says: "I'm fine!"
Trans. to penis-shaped house. Various assimilated are dancing. Rick is on the couch drinking.
Unity says: "Do you know what I love about you, Rick?"
Unity says: "You're the only single mind I’ve met who really sees the big picture."
Rick says: "You got that right."
Rick says: "But..."
Rick says: "baby, listen."
Rick says: "Y-you're talking about taking over planets and galaxies, you gotta..."
Rick says: "you gotta just..."
Rick says: "remember to let go sometimes, you know."
Unity says: "I can let go!"
Unity says: "Hey, look!"
Unity says: "You see that town across the river?"
Unity says: "Watch this."
Planes fly past and bomb the town, blowing it all up.
Rick says: "Whoa!"
Unity says: "Ha ha!"
Unity says: "Woot!"
Rick says: "Whoa!"
Rick says: "That's not what I meant!"
Unity says: "It's okay!"
Unity says: "It's okay, I evacuated!"
Unity says: "I evacuated the town, look!"
Unity says: "Hey!"
Unity says: "Right here!"
Unity says: "We’re fine!"
Rick says: "Oh, that was awesome!"
Rick says: "My grandkids weren't in that town, right?"
Rick says: "A-are my grandkids alive?"
Rick says: "..."
Rick says: "H-hey, my drink is empty."
Trans. to street. More assimilated are dancing, though they’re falling over and puking. Vehicles crash. Morty and Summer are running and almost get crushed by falling beams.
Morty says: "Aah!"
Summer says: "Aah!"
Summer says: "Unity, what's happening?"
Steven Phillips says: "Who's Unity?"
Steven Phillips says: "You kids have nice feet."
Steven Phillips says: "Mind if I take a picture?"
Summer says: "Gross, no!"
He takes a picture anyway and wanders off.
Morty says: "I think you're getting what you wanted, Summer."
Morty says: "Something's happening to Unity."
Summer says: "Do..."
Summer says: "all of you remember who you are?"
Ron Benson says: "..."
Ron Benson says: "Yeah."
Ron Benson says: "My name is Ron Benson."
Ron Benson says: "I'm..."
Ron Benson says: "an electrical engineer."
Ron Benson says: "Father of two, and as you can see from my flat concentric nipple rings, I'm a member of this planet's top race!"
Summer says: "Okay, that's good!"
Summer says: "Uh..."
Summer says: "Don't focus too much on the last part, but..."
Daryl Jefferson says: "I'm Daryll Jefferson."
Daryl Jefferson says: "I'm a landscaper."
Daryl Jefferson says: "And I'll be damned if that ripple-nipple bitch's race is superior!"
Daryl Jefferson says: "The cone-nipple people will rule this world!"
Ron Benson says: "You shut your mouth, you dirty knife-nipple bastards!"
Daryl Jefferson says: "What'd you say to me, you target-chested piece of shit?"
Alien man says: "Race war!"
The crowd breaks out into fighting.
Summer says: "Why are you fighting?"
Summer says: "Can't you see you're all the same?"
Morty says: "Ah, Summer."
Morty says: "Ha ha."
Morty says: "First race war, huh?"
Morty says: "Way to go, Summer."
Morty says: "You started a race war."
Summer says: "I didn't start it!"
Summer says: "They're the racists!"
Summer says: "I..."
Summer says: "I  merely empowered them to follow their apparently misguided dreams!"
Morty says: "Okay, thanks for clarifying!"
Morty says: "Y- I'll have a super accurate headstone now!"
Rioter says: "Hey wait, what race are you guys?"
Morty says: "We’re neither!"
Morty says: "S-see?"
Summer says: "Yeah, take my word for it."
Summer says: "We just have regular nipples."
Rioter says: "Hey!"
Rioter says: "These two freaks have no race!"
Morty and Summer run, and get chased by a gang of rioters, before getting cornered against a wall.
Morty says: "Oh, there's no place like home!"
Morty says: "There's no place like home!"
Morty says: "Remember, Summer?"
Summer says: "Oh..."
The two hug.
Morty says: "From Dorothy and The Tiny People movie?"
Summer says: "O-oh, yes, yes yes..."
Morty says: "All the tiny people?"
Summer says: "Dorothy, take us away!"
Summer says: "Take us away!"
As the rioters get closer, Unity SWAT drops in and surrounds the two, pushing the rioters back. An assimilated drops down and pulls the two into a hovercopter.
Unity says: "Hello Summer."
Unity says: "Hello Morty."
Unity says: "It's okay!"
Unity says: "You're safe now."
Morty says: "U-Unity?"
Unity says: "Yes."
Summer says: "Oh, Unity I am so sorry."
Summer says: "I didn't know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks!"
Summer says: "I was thinking more of..."
Summer says: "a choose-your-own-cellphone-carrier thing."
Unity says: "Oh, Summer, you did nothing wrong!"
Unity says: "I'm having fun with your grandpa!"
Unity says: "Lost a little control."
Unity says: "Probably shouldn't be piloting a hovercopter, nor should I be..."
Unity says: "running two hundred thousand pediatric hospitals and twelve million deep friers, but hey!"
Unity says: "It's not like this planet can take its business elsewhere!"
Morty says: "Um..."
Morty says: "should we maybe stop somewhere and get you a coffee?"
Morty says: "Maybe splash a little water on your face, or..."
Morty says: "?"
Unity says: "No, no, if I wanted to be sober, I wouldn't have gotten drunk!"
Unity says: "Wooohoooo!"
Trans. to Rick’s underground lair. Blim Blam is chained up, Beth and Jerry are arguing.
Jerry says: "Oh man."
Jerry says: "I cannot wait."
Jerry says: "I cannot wait to hear Rick explain his way around this."
Jerry says: "He is gone!"
Beth says: "Jerry, stop!"
Beth says: "Please, okay, we weren't even supposed to be down here."
Jerry says: "Oh my god!"
Jerry says: "I love this!"
Jerry says: "I love that this is how far you will go for him."
Jerry says: "You wanna go upstairs, and cut carrots, and watch a Lifetime original, above a fucking alien dungeon!"
Jerry says: "Your relationship with your father is psychotic!"
Beth says: "Oh listen to you relish the idea that my genius father is a bad person!"
Beth says: "Step out of your ego for a second and look at this thing!"
Beth says: "It's a monster!"
Beth says: "He might have it chained up so that it doesn't eat the planet!"
Jerry says: "Right, because your father's such an altruist?"
Jerry says: "I once saw him briefly forget the word for humans!"
Jerry says: "He's probably harvesting this creature's organs!"
Beth says: "He's probably racing to cure its space aids!"
Jerry says: "He's going to eat it!"
Beth says: "He's protecting it!"
Both says: "Shut up!"
Trans. to penis-shaped house, now on fire. Summer and Morty enter.
Summer says: "Unity!"
Summer says: "This place is a mess!"
Unity says: "Oh, it's cool!"
Unity says: "The part of me that's the cleaning lady is coming on Friday."
Unity says: "Oh my god!"
Unity says: "I have a meeting at the galactic federation in an hour."
Unity says: "Oh, I'll never make it!"
Unity says: "Ah, I'll push it to next week."
Morty says: "Unity, could you get Rick out here please?"
Unity says: "He's..."
Unity says: "unavailable!"
Summer says: "Having sex with you, we get it!"
Summer says: "Gross."
Summer says: "Get him out here now."
Summer says: "Grandpa Rick!"
Morty says: "Rick!"
Morty says: "Rick!"
Summer says: "I'm gonna tell mom and dad about the gagoo you have locked up under the garage!"
Rick stumbles out, topless, wearing an ammunition belt, a mexican hat and pants, a fake moustache and clutching a bottle of beer.
Rick says: "What the hell..."
Rick says: "is your problem?"
Summer says: "Grandpa, we need to go home!"
Summer says: "Now!"
Rick says: "Fine, geez!"
He opens a portal.
Rick says: "See ya!"
Morty says: "Uh, Rick?"
Morty says: "I think we should all go."
Rick says: "Tend your garden, kids, I'm kinda doing a thing here."
He puts his arms around two assimilated, who cheer and laugh.
Summer says: "Grandpa Rick, we’re not leaving without you!"
Rick says: "Oh my god  you guys I get it."
Rick says: "You're afraid the big bad hivemind is gonna steal  your grandpa away."
Summer says: "Actually, no."
Summer says: "I think Unity's great and you're a horrible influence on it!"
Rick says: "What?"
Morty says: "This isn't healthy, Rick!"
Morty says: "Y- you know you-you're really up to no good around here."
Morty says: "I-at-at this place,  you know?"
Summer says: "You and Unity are like..."
Summer says: "like..."
Summer says: "leggings and mid-calf boots."
Summer says: "You think you're great together but you're just bringing out the worst in each other!"
Rick says: "Oh, gee, boy Summer, well put."
Rick says: "Uh, why don't we see what Unity thinks."
Rick says: "Unity?"
Unity says: "I'm just taking a little break from stuff."
Unity says: "You know?"
Unity says: "I need to relax."
Rick says: "Oh, hey, wh-what's this on the news, guys?"
Rick says: "L-l-let me turn it up."
Unity says: "In the news today, this looks a lot worse than it is."
Unity says: "We’re..."
Unity says: "really just having a good time."
Unity says: "Karen?"
Unity says: "Thanks, Todd."
Unity says: "Up next: Are you a concerned grandchild or just a buzzkill?"
Unity says: "We'll tell you how you can really know for sure!"
Rick says: "I think you two are a little outnumbered."
Summer says: "Okay!"
Summer says: "Well, what if you did it for me?"
Summer says: "What if you came with us as a favour to us..."
Summer says: "because you love us?"
Rick says: "What?"
Rick says: "Dumb."
Rick says: "Bye."
Rick says: "Summer's just a hyper-emotional, needy little- what's the word I'm looking for here..."
Rick says: "uh- human!"
Rick says: "It runs in the family!"
Rick says: "I can tolerate it but I can't give a crap about it."
Rick says: "Take a hike."
Summer says: "Take care of yourself, Unity."
Summer and Morty leave through the portal.
Rick says: "I'm not looking for judgement, just a yes or no."
Rick says: "Can you assimilate a giraffe?"
Trans. back to Beth and Jerry.
Beth says: "You're the worst!"
Jerry says: "No!"
Jerry says: "You're the worst!"
Jerry says: "You don't support this family!"
The two start yelling over the top of one another.
Jerry says: "All you care about is yourself!"
Beth says: "You think supporting the family is about supporting you emotionally..."
Jerry says: "You've got two children being dragged across the cosmos..."
Beth says: "..."
Beth says: "but you're unsupportable!"
Beth says: "Because it's never enough, Jerry!"
Jerry says: "..."
Jerry says: "by your dangerously ill father, and you force me to watch it happen!"
Beth says: "It will never be enough support to satisfy you!"
Beth says: "And you don't even know what it's like..."
Jerry says: "Because you'd rather lose them and lose me than lose him!"
Beth says: "..."
Beth says: "to be afraid of losing anything because you cling and you cling and you cling..."
Jerry says: "And why?"
Jerry says: "Because you're the child, Beth."
Jerry says: "You, not me, you!"
Blim Blam gurgles angrily and breaks free.
Jerry says: "Aaah!"
Beth says: "Oh my god!"
Both back away. Jerry puts his arm protectively in front of Beth. Blim Blam moves past them and breaks into a cabinet, before pulling out an object and pointing it at the two like a gun.
Beth says: "Aah!"
Jerry says: "Aah!"
Blim Blam pushes the object into his neck.
Blim Blam says: "Um, first of all, hello."
Blim Blam says: "Uh, my name is Blim Blam the korblok."
Blim Blam says: "Second of all, cards on the table: I am a murderer that eats babies and I came to this planet to eat babies."
Blim Blam says: "However, I am also carrying a highly infectious disease, that I suppose you could call ‘space aids’ as you put it, and Rick did chain me up so that he could attempt to cure it."
Blim Blam says: "At the same time, Rick's motivation to cure my disease was not to save my life or anyone else's, but to patent and sell the cure for billions of blemflarks."
Blim Blam says: "But you know the reason why I ripped my chains out of the wall?"
Blim Blam says: "And do you know why I'm never coming back to this planet?"
Blim Blam says: "Because the two of you are the fucking worst!"
Blim Blam says: "You both hate yourselves and each other!"
Blim Blam says: "And the idea that it has anything to do with Rick is laughable!"
Blim Blam says: "I'd laugh but I'm biologically incapable, that's how alien I am!"
Blim Blam says: "And even I'm sitting here listening to the two of you, and being like, what the fuck?!"
Blim Blam says: "!"
Blim Blam says: "?"
Blim Blam says: "So!"
Blim Blam says: "Good luck with your shitty marriage, and I'm sorry that Rick has to deal with either of you."
Blim Blam says: "Blim Blam, out!"
He drops the translator and leaves, but quickly rushes back to pick it up again.
Blim Blam says: "You know what?"
Blim Blam says: "I'm taking this."
Trans. to garage. Summer and Morty have returned. Blim Blam pushes at the garage door but can’t open it.
Blim Blam says: "How do you- what is this?"
Morty activates the garage door opener.
Blim Blam says: "Uh, is there a slow setting?"
Blim Blam says: "Best door ever."
He leaves, flipping the two off with a penis-shaped finger.
Trans. to Rick, who’s on the couch watching TV surrounded by several assimilated.
Rick says: "Aaah!"
Rick says: "Alright, I’m bored."
Unity says: "Rick, is there a way for you to call Summer and Morty?"
Rick says: "Pfft, screw those guys!"
Rick says: "Uugh, I'll be right back."
Rick says: "Don't waste your brain on those weirdos, Unity."
Rick says: "They're no different from any other aimless chumps that you occupy."
Rick says: "They just put you at the centre of their lives because you're powerful and then because they put you there they want you to be less powerful."
Rick says: "Never gonna happen though, right?"
Unity says: "Never."
Rick says: "Never!"
Rick says: "Back in a flash."
Rick goes into the bathroom, and washes his hands and face.
Rick says: "Best weekend ever, Rick!"
Rick says: "I agree, Rick!"
Rick says: "Let's see how long we can go!"

Unity says: "And I have no problem with that, but..."
Unity says: "it clearly means I have a problem with myself."
Unity says: "I'm sure there's no perfect version of me."
Unity says: "I'm sure I'll just unify species after species and never really be complete."
Unity says: "But I know how it goes with us."
Unity says: "I lose who I am and become part of you."
Unity says: "Because in a strange way you're better at what I do without even trying."
Unity says: "Yours, and nobody else's, Unity."
Unity says: "P."
Unity says: "S."
Unity says: "I don't know where those coal miners were before they got assimilated."
Unity says: "You might want to get checked."

Quote.
Rick says: ""They're no different from any of the aimless chumps that you occupy, they just put you at the center of their lives because you're powerful, then because they put you there they want you to be less powerful."
Rick says: "Never gonna happen though, right?"
Unity says: ""Never."
Unity's Note.
I realize now that I am attracted to you for the same reason I cant be with you. You can't change and I have no problem with that but it clearly means, I have a problem with myself. I'm sure there's no perfect version of me Im sure I'll just unify species after species and never be complete.
But I know how it goes with us, I lose who I am and become part of you. As in a strange way your better at what I do without even trying, yours and nobody else's.
PS. I don't know what those coal miners was before I assimilated, you might want to get checked.".
