Morty says: "Aw, geez, dad."
Morty says: "Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once."
Rick says: "Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi."
Morty says: "Oh, come on, Rick."
Morty says: "You know I can't."
Rick says: "The square root of Pi, Morty."
Rick says: "Go!"
Morty says: "1."
Morty says: "77245385..."
Morty says: "Whoa!"
Beth says: "What the hell?"
Jerry says: "Holy crap."
Jerry says: "He's right."
Rick says: "Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics."
Morty says: ""The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system."
Morty says: "" Wow!"
Morty says: "I'm so smart!"
Jerry says: "But—"
Rick says: "I told the both of you school is stupid."
Rick says: "It's not how you learn things."
Rick says: "Morty's a gifted child."
Rick says: "He has a special mind."
Rick says: "That's why he's my little helper."
Rick says: "He's like me."
Rick says: "He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life."
Rick says: "He's too smart for school."
Rick says: "He needs to keep hanging out and helping me."
Beth says: "Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop."
Jerry says: "No, I-I understand."
Jerry says: "Uh, maybe we overreacted."
Jerry says: "But he has to keep going to school."
Rick says: "Okay, Jerry."
Rick says: "You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do?"
Rick says: "Say no?"
Rick says: "You-you really wear the pants around here."
Rick says: "I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication."
Summer says: "Frank Palicky was frozen to death today!"
Rick says: "No idea what you're talking about."
Jerry says: "Okay."
Jerry says: "Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour."
Jerry says: "Don't stay up all night again."
Jerry says: "This is good, though."
Jerry says: "This can work."
Jerry says: "I think we can be a family and now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you."
Beth says: "You know what?"
Beth says: "Okay."
Morty says: "Holy cow, Rick."
Morty says: "I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter."
Rick says: "Full disclosure, Morty it's not."
Rick says: "Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity."
Morty says: "Aw, man."
Rick says: "Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty."
Starting right about now.
Morty says: "Ohh, man."
Rick says: "I'm sorry, Morty."
Rick says: "It's a bummer."
Rick says: "In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures."
Rick says: "And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty."
Rick says: "We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty."
Rick says: "Just you and me, Morty."
Rick says: "The outside world is our enemy, Morty."
Rick says: "We're the only friends we've got, Morty."
Rick says: "It's just Rick and Morty."
Rick says: "Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty."
Rick says: "Rick and Morty forever and forever."
Rick says: "Morty's things."
Rick says: "Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time."
Rick says: "All day long, forever."
Rick says: "All a hundred days."
Rick says: "Rick and Morty forever 100 times."
Rick says: "Over and over, rickandmortyadventures."
Rick says: "com."
Rick says: "All 100 years."
Rick says: "Every minute, rickandmorty."
Rick says: "com."
