Open Int. Rick's garage.
Rick is dissecting a rat.
Rick says: "T-t-t-this is just sloppy craftsmanship."
Morty says: "Hey, Rick."
Rick says: "Oh, yes, Morty."
Rick says: "It's almost unbelievable, isn't it?"
Morty says: "Yeah, you know?"
Morty says: "There's something about the air."
Morty says: "And just the way the sunshine is."
Rick says: "Oh, sure, buddy."
Rick says: "Yeah."
Rick says: "Sure."
Rick says: "B-brilliant."
Rick says: "Very convincing."
Morty says: "Wh… convincing?"
Rick says: "Oh!"
Rick says: "Responsive, too!"
Rick says: "In real time!"
Rick says: "I love it!"
Morty says: "Uhhokay."
Beth says: "*robotic* I’m going to work."
Beth says: "Morty, good morning."
Beth says: "Dad, good morning."
Beth says: "I am going to work."
Beth says: "Goodbye."
Morty says: "What's with Mom?"
Rick says: "Oh, what's with Mom?"
Rick says: "So, you're saying that she's acting weird?"
Rick says: "How soph—"
Rick says: "*burp*—"
Rick says: "isticated."
Rick says: "Careful, guys."
Rick says: "You're gonna burn out the CPU with this one."
Morty says: "Okay, you know what, Rick?"
Morty says: "You're acting weird, too."
Rick says: "Whatever, quote-unquote “Morty."
Morty says: "Alright, well I'll see you after school."
Morty says: "Ow!"
Morty says: "Oof!"
Morty says: "Ugh!"
Morty says: "Damn it!"
Morty says: "I'm all right."
Morty says: "I'm okay."
Trans. Morty’s math class.
Mr. Goldenfold says: "Alright, who can tell me what 5 x 9 is?"
Mr. Goldenfold says: "Morty?"
Morty says: "Uh, me?"
Mr. Goldenfold says: "What is 5 x 9?"
Morty says: "Um, you know, it's, uh, at least 40."
Students gasp.
Mr. Goldenfold says: "Morty, that's exactly correct!"
Mr. Goldenfold says: "5 x 9 is at least 40!"
Mr. Goldenfold says: "Come up here."
Students cheer.
Jessica says: "Whoo!"
Jessica says: "Way to go, Morty!"
Mr. Goldenfold says: "Everybody, this is the best student."
Mr. Goldenfold says: "I want you to be the teacher today."
Mr. Goldenfold says: "*sits down at a desk* Teach us, Morty!"
Morty says: "W-w-w-what do you want me to teach you?"
Student says: "Ooh, ooh!"
Student says: "How do you make concentrated dark matter?"
Mr. Goldenfold says: "Oh, that's a good question."
Morty says: "Concentrated huh?"
Mr. Goldenfold says: "Concentrated dark matter."
Mr. Goldenfold says: "The fuel for accelerated space travel."
Mr. Goldenfold says: "Now, do you know how to make it?"
Jessica says: "Come on, Morty."
Jessica says: "Isn't your grandpa, like, a scientist?"
Morty says: "Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn't go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff."
Jessica says: "I bet you've seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot."
Jessica says: "You know, if you tell us, I’ll be your girlfriend."
Morty says: "Uh, y-you will?"
Mr. Goldenfold says: "Seems like a rare opportunity, Morty."
Rick says: "*kicks open the door* Morty, u-uh, come on."
Rick says: "There's a family emergency."
Rick grabs Morty by one arm. Mr. Goldenfold grabs the other.
Mr. Goldenfold says: "Stop right there!"
Mr. Goldenfold says: "If he leaves, I'm giving him an F!"
Rick says: "He doesn't care."
Morty says: "Aw, man!"
Morty says: "Rick, I have to go back!"
Morty says: "I think I was about to get married!"
Morty says: "*falls down* Ugh!"
Rick says: "Take a shower with me, Morty."
Morty says: "What?!"
Morty says: "!"
Rick says: "Listen to me, Morty."
Rick says: "Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now."
Rick says: "*strips* Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty."
Morty says: "Ugh!"
Morty says: "I'm gonna get an F in class, Rick."
Rick says: "Morty, that's not class."
Rick says: "T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher."
Rick says: "This isn't your school."
Rick says: "This entire world is not the world."
Morty says: "Wait a minute."
Morty says: "W-what are you talking about?"
Rick says: "It’s all fake *burps* Morty, all of it."
Rick says: "Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of… crazy, fake nonsense, Morty."
Morty says: "Monitor us?!"
Morty says: "!"
Morty says: "*looks around and tries to cover himself* W-who?!"
Morty says: "!"
Rick says: "Zigerion scammers, Morty."
Rick says: "The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists."
Rick says: "You know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity."
Morty says: "Aw, come on, Rick."
Morty says: "If everyone’s just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica."
Rick says: "I can’t let you do that, Morty."
Rick grabs Morty’s clothes and they begin fighting over them.
Morty says: "Give it to me!"
Rick says: "No!"
Rick says: "You give it to me!"
Morty says: "G-g-give it!"
Rick says: "Morty, come on!"
Rick says: "Morty!"
Morty says: "No, Rick!"
View of simulated world expands out to reveal they’re in an enormous spacecraft.
Trans. Zigerion control room.
Zigerions groan and look away from the monitors with disgust.
Zigerion 1 says: "Oh, god, sir!"
Zigerion 1 says: "They're still naked!"
Zigerion 1 says: "Ugh."
Prince Nebulon says: "Well, check every five quintons and tell me when they're not!"
Zigerion 1 says: "I think we should make Kevin look, sir."
Kevin says: "What?!"
Kevin says: "!"
Kevin says: "No!"
Kevin says: "W-w-why would you even say that?"
Stu says: "Uh, sir, we have a situation over here."
Prince Nebulon says: "If there's a wiener on that monitor, I swear to god, Stu."
Stu says: "Something is drawing a lot of processing power."
Stu says: "Oh, wait."
Stu says: "No wonder."
Stu says: "There's another real human in the simulator."
Jerry says: "Okay, Jerry, big pitch meeting."
Jerry says: "Make-or-break time."
Jerry says: "*trims nostril hairs while driving* You can do this."
Prince Nebulon says: "How did this happen?!"
Prince Nebulon says: "!"
Prince Nebulon says: "Where's the Abductions Department?"
Zigerion 2 says: "Hey, man, Abductions just follows the acquisition order."
Zigerion 3 says: "Don't put this on Acquisitions!"
Zigerion 3 says: "We only acquire humans that haven't been simulated!"
Kevin says: "Well, Simulations doesn't simulate anybody that's been abducted, so—"
Prince Nebulon says: "Oh, I see!"
Prince Nebulon says: "Oh, oh!"
Prince Nebulon says: "It was no one's fault."
Prince Nebulon says: "Oh, okay."
Prince Nebulon says: "I'm sorry."
Prince Nebulon says: "Well, then, problem solved."
Prince Nebulon says: "Oh, wait no."
Prince Nebulon says: "*shouts* There's still another human in here!"
Prince Nebulon says: "Who is he?"
Stu says: "Rick's son-in-law, Jerry Smith."
Stu says: "So far, he hasn't noticed he's in a simulation."
Prince Nebulon says: "*sighs* Well, cap his sector at 5% processing, keep his settings on auto, and we'll deal with him later."
Prince Nebulon says: "Rick Sanchez is the target."
Trans. Jerry’s car.
Jerry says: "*inhales deeply* Gotta relax."
Jerry says: "It's just a pitch."
Jerry says: "Gotta relax."
He turns on the radio.
Radio says: "This is earth radio."
Radio says: "And now, here's…human music."
Repetitive rhythmic beeping.
Jerry says: "Hmm."
Jerry says: "Human music."
Jerry says: "I like it."
Pan out to see Jerry’s sector of the simulation, followed by a transition to Rick and Morty’s.
Rick and Morty pant as they run naked down the street. Rick shoves their clothes into a sewer.
Morty says: "Rick!"
Rick says: "Uhp, uhp, uhp!"
Rick says: "Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong!"
Rick says: "It's the only way we can speak freely."
Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look, that guy's putting a.
Morty says: "I don't know, Rick."
Morty says: "I mean, I’ve seen people do that before."
Rick says: "Well, look at that old lady."
Rick says: "She's, she's walking a cat on a leash."
Morty says: "Uh, Mrs."
Morty says: "Spencer does that all the time, Rick."
Rick says: "Look, I-I-I don't wanna hear about Mrs."
Rick says: "Spencer, Morty!"
Rick says: "She's an idiot!"
Rick says: "Alright, alright, there."
Rick says: "W-what about that, Morty?"
A Poptart walks out of a toaster house and into a toaster car before driving away.
Morty says: "Okay, okay, you got me on that one."
Rick says: "Oh, really, Morty?"
Rick says: "Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before?"
Morty says: "No, no."
Morty says: "I haven't seen that."
Morty says: "I mean, why would a Poptart wanna live inside a toaster, Rick?"
Morty says: "I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live."
Morty says: "You know what I mean?"
Rick says: "You're missing the point, Morty."
Rick says: "Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels?"
Rick says: "I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house?"
Rick says: "No."
Morty says: "So, why are they doing this?"
Morty says: "W-what do they want?"
Rick says: "Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you'd been paying attention."
Siren wails. Ambulance drives up to them and the doors open.
Paramedic says: "We got the president of the United States in here!"
Paramedic says: "We need 10cc of concentrated dark matter, stat, or he'll die!"
Rick slams the ambulance doors shut and starts walking off.
Morty says: "Concentrated dark matter!"
Morty says: "They were asking about that in class."
Morty says: "Wait, wha, w-w-what are we gonna do?"
Rick says: "We'll scam the scammers, Morty."
Rick says: "And we're gonna take them for everything they've got."

Jerry dials on his cellphone. As he walks, he passes the same three people repeatedly.
Simulation Beth says: "*answers phone* Hello."
Jerry says: "Guess who just sold the apples campaign."
Simulation Beth says: "Who just sold the apples campaign?"
Jerry says: "Me!"
Jerry says: "I guess it wasn't a rip-off of "got milk?"
Jerry says: "" after all."
Jerry says: "Guess someone was wrong."
Simulation Beth says: "Yes."
Simulation Beth says: "Okay."
Jerry says: "Wait, really?"

Morty says: "Aw, geez, Rick."
Morty says: "I-I don't know if I like this plan,you know?"
Morty says: "I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous."
Rick says: "Morty, relax."
Rick says: "It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there."
Rick says: "You're gonna be fine."
Rick says: "Yo, deejay, drop that beat."
Trans. Stage in park.
Hip-hop beat plays. Crowd cheers.
Rick says: "Uh-oh, Morty."
Morty says: "You got that right, Rick."
Hordes of people appear from all directions and congregate in the park.
Rick says: "Now that’s more like it!"
Rick says: "Morty, here we go."
Rick says: "Let me hear everybody say "hey-oh!"
Rick says: "" yeah!"
Trans. Smith house.

Rick says: "Run, Morty!"
Rick says: "Before the system reboots!"
Trans. Ext. Smith house.
Jerry says: "Yeah!"
Jerry says: "You like that?"
Jerry says: "Now who's unremarkable?"
Jerry says: "You hungry for apples?"
Jerry says: "Are you hungry for apples?!"
Jerry says: "!"
Trans. Beth and Jerry’s bedroom.
Jerry lies in bed beside Beth, who is frozen in place.
Jerry says: "Oh, my god."
Jerry says: "That's the best sex I've ever had in my life."
Jerry says: "It's… it's too good."
Jerry says: "I don't deserve this, Beth."
Jerry says: "I'm a fraud."
Trans. Rick and Morty running through frozen simulation.
Morty says: "Oh, man, Rick!"
Morty says: "W-w-w-where we running to?"

Zigerion says: "Sir, they're over the edge."
Prince Nebulon says: "Yes, they are."
Prince Nebulon says: "Just as planned."
Prince Nebulon says: "*evil laughter, others join in* Oh, this is going to be such a mindfuck!"
Trans. Corridor in spacecraft.
Rick says: "Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty."
Rick says: "That's how we're gonna scam these idiots."
Morty says: "So, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you're so much smarter than them?"
Rick says: "It's an obsession for them at this point."
Rick says: "The Zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, Morty."
Rick says: "Every time they do, I'm one step ahead of them."
Rick says: "*finds central processing room* Aha!"
Rick says: "Here we go."
Rick says: "*starts collecting chips* Grab as many processors as you can carry, Morty."
Rick says: "These guys aren't good at much, but they're really good at making these chips."
Morty says: "I’ve got so many, I can barely hold them all!"
Morty says: "*holding chips in his shirt* Look at, look at this."
Morty says: "Oops."
Morty says: "I dropped one."
Rick says: "Don't worry about it, Morty."
Rick says: "There's plenty of them, you little goofball."
Rick says: "Come here, Morty!"
Rick says: "Oh, I gotcha!"
Morty says: "Come on, quit it, Rick!"
Morty says: "Quit it!"
Rick says: "Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella."
They sneak towards the escape pods. Rick throws a chip and distracts the guards while they steal a pod and fly away.
Morty says: "Wow."
Morty says: "What do you know?"
Morty says: "Huh."
Morty says: "That was easy."
Rick says: "Totes malotes, dawg."
Morty says: "Just kind of hard to believe, you know?"
Rick says: "Believe it, Morty."
Rick says: "And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry, and the Zigerions got nothing of mine."
Trans. Jerry’s boss’s office.
Jerry says: "Mr."
Jerry says: "Marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk?"
Mr. Marklevitz says: "*snaps fingers* Yes."
Jerry says: "Look, I’m a fraud."
Jerry says: "I mean, let's face it."
Jerry says: ""Hungry for apples" is just a rip-off of "Got milk?"
Jerry says: "" It's almost identical."
Mr. Marklevitz says: "*snaps fingers* Yes."
Jerry says: "Okay."
Jerry says: "I deserve that."
Jerry says: "Um, I guess I'll just pack up my desk."
Mr. Marklevitz says: "*snaps fingers* Yes."
Jerry says: "*crying* Oh my god."
Jerry says: "Wait."
Jerry says: "You know what?!"
Jerry says: "!"
Jerry says: "No!"
Mr. Marklevitz says: "*snaps fingers* Yes."
Jerry says: "Yeah!"
Jerry says: "Wait."
Jerry says: "Really?"
Mr. Marklevitz says: "*snaps fingers* Yes."
Jerry says: "Yes!"
Jerry says: "I mean, it may be derivative, but it's the most successful campaign to come out of this agency in a long time."
Mr. Marklevitz says: "*snaps fingers* Yes."
Jerry says: "I-I’m not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples, like an Appley or something."
Mr. Marklevitz says: "*snaps fingers* Yes."
Jerry says: "Is there really an award called the Appley for apple-related ad campaigns?"
Mr. Marklevitz says: "*snaps fingers* Yes."
Jerry says: "Could we nominate me?"
Mr. Marklevitz says: "*snaps fingers* Yes."
Jerry says: "Holy crap!"
Jerry runs out. Mr. Marklevitz glitches.
Trans. Ext. Smith house.
Rick and Morty get out of the escape pod and head into the garage with the chips.
Rick says: "Get in, Morty."
Rick says: "I'm gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff."
Second level simulation vanishes.
Prince Nebulon says: "Well, what's this?"
Prince Nebulon says: "W-what could this possibly be?"
Prince Nebulon says: "Because it looks like you're inside a simulation…inside a simulation."
Prince Nebulon says: "You're still on the ship."
Prince Nebulon says: "Game-day bucket go boom!"
Cynthia says: "Sir, the, uh, doctor's appointment to examine the discoloration on your butthole flaps was—"
Prince Nebulon says: "Too loud, Cynthia."
Prince Nebulon says: "Too loud and too specific."
Prince Nebulon says: "We've known how to make concentrated dark matter for a long time."
Prince Nebulon says: "But now we also know the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez!"
Prince Nebulon says: "All your most valuable secrets will now be ours!"
Prince Nebulon says: "That is why you're never getting home."
Get them!
Guards try to grab Rick and Morty. Rick pulls down Morty’s.
Rick says: "RUN MORTY!"
Morty pulls up his pants. They run through the spacecraft and are chased by Zigerions.

Rick says: "Screw it."
Rick says: "We don't have time."
Rick says: "Come on."
Jerry says: "*sobbing* No!"
Chase continues. The three make it onto a spaceship.
Rick says: "Man up, Jerry!"
Rick says: "I may need you to work the lasers."
Morty says: "Oh, man!"
Morty says: "They're hot on our tail, Rick!"
Rick says: "I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter."
Morty says: "Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick?"
Rick says: "Yeah."
Rick says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Rick says: "Uh, check the engine room."
Rick says: "We just need cesium, Plutonic quarks, and bottled water."
Morty says: "Whoa!"
Morty says: "It's all here, Rick!"
Rick says: "Wow, Morty."
Rick says: "Lucky break."
Rick says: "Grab that bucket."
Rick says: "Okay, two parts Plutonic quarks, one part cesium."
Morty says: "Okay."
Morty says: "Uh-huh."
Morty says: "Alright."
Rick says: "Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here!"
Rick says: "What are you doing, Morty?!"
Rick says: "!"
Rick says: "There's no time!"
Rick says: "Oh, no."
Simulation breaks down...again.
Jerry says: "What the…?"
Rick says: "No!"
Prince Nebulon says: "*laughing* Oh my god, Rick."
Prince Nebulon says: "How dumb are you?"
Prince Nebulon says: "You're inside a simulation of a simulation…inside another giant simulation!"
Prince Nebulon says: "*laughs harder* W-we never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter."
Prince Nebulon says: "But we do now!"
Prince Nebulon says: "We do now, sucka!"
Rick says: "You simulated my grandson's genitalia?!"
Rick says: "!"
Rick says: "Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!"

Rick says: "All right."
Rick says: "Okay."
Rick says: "All right, great."
Rick says: "Wonderful."
Rick says: "You win."
Rick says: "Can we go home now?"
Zigerion 1 says: "I don't know."
Zigerion 1 says: "Can you?"
Prince Nebulon says: "Ha!"
Prince Nebulon says: "*fist bumps* Nice."
Prince Nebulon says: "Okay, okay."
Prince Nebulon says: "Show this gullible turd to his shuttle."
Prince Nebulon says: "I'm done with him."
Prince Nebulon says: "Oh, wait."
Prince Nebulon says: "Let me get a picture."
Prince Nebulon says: "*snaps a selfie of himself with Rick* Aww."
Prince Nebulon says: "Look at his face."
Prince Nebulon says: "He's trying to figure out if He's in a simulation still."
Prince Nebulon says: "Are you, Rick?"
Prince Nebulon says: "Are you?"
Prince Nebulon says: "*laughs, walks away* You're not."
Prince Nebulon says: "*walks back* Or are you?"
Prince Nebulon says: "*shouts after them* Oh, a-and, by the way, I don't have discolored butthole flaps."
Prince Nebulon says: "That was part of the simulation."

Rick says: "Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it."
Jerry says: "You know what, Rick?"
Jerry says: "Those guys took you for a ride, too."
Jerry says: "You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe, now that you're one of us."
Rick says: "Maybe you're right, Jerry."
Rick says: "Maybe you're right."
Trans. Zigerion space craft, control room.
