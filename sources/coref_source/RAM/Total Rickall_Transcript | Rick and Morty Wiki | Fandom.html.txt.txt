Smith family is eating, Jerry checks his mail.
Jerry says: "Steve, I just got a weird e-mail."
Jerry says: "Did you buy us airline tickets?"
Uncle Steve says: "Aw shoot, it was supposed to be a surprise!"
Uncle Steve says: "I wanted to thank you for letting me live here all this time, so I'm treating the family to a vacation!"
Beth says: "Steve, you're so sweet!"
Morty says: "Thanks Uncle Steve!"
Summer says: "Best uncle ever!"
Uncle Steve says: "Look out world, the Smith family is goin' to Paris!"
Summer says: "Yeah!"
Summer says: "Awesome!"
Rick enters the room, and dumps some very familiar-looking rocks into the kitchen trash.
Jerry says: "Rick, I don't like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash."
Rick says: "Well, I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry."
Rick says: "But life is made of little concessions."
Uncle Steve says: "You're gonna land on your feet Jer."
Uncle Steve says: "Some company out there's gonna thank they're lucky stars they hired my little brother."
Rick says: "Who the fuck are you?"
Jerry says: "My goofy brother Steve."
Jerry says: "He's been living here almost a year now, are you losing your mind?"
Uncle Steve says: "Hey someone's been spending too much time around glowing rocks am I right?"
The family screams.
Morty says: "What the hell, Rick?"
Morty says: "What the hell?"
Rick says: "Everybody just relax for a second."
Rick says: "There's no such thing as an "Uncle Steve."
Rick says: "" That is an alien parasite."
Uncle Steve's body turns into a blue and purple worm-like creature, spewing pink liquid all over the table.
Jerry says: "But I've known him my whole life!"
Rick says: "No, you haven't Jerry."
Rick says: "These telepathic little bastards, they embed themselves in memories they use those to multiply, spread out, and take over planets."
Rick says: "It's disgusting."
Morty says: "Steve wasn't real?"
Rick says: "He's a real piece of shit!"
Rick says: "This is a big one, someone probably tracked in last week on the bottom of their shoe or on a piece of alien fruit."
Summer says: "Someone?"
Rick says: "Get off the high road, Summer."
Rick says: "We all got pink eye because you won't stop texting on the toilet."
Morty says: "But Uncle Steve taught me how to ride a bike."
Rick says: "No, "Steve" put that memory in your brain so he could live in your house, eat your food, and multiply."
Rick says: "We could be infested with these things, so we gotta keep an eye out for any zany, wacky characters that pop up."
Mr. Poopybutthole says: "Ooh wee, whatever you want Rick!"
Mr. Poopybutthole says: "We're here to help!"
Rick says: "Thanks Mr."
Rick says: "Poopybutthole."
Rick says: "I always could count on you."
Rick says: "Alright, there's six of us and that's it."
Rick says: "Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr."
Rick says: "Poopybutthole, and Summer."
Mr. Poopybutthole says: "Maybe you got the first one in time Rick!"
Rick says: "Can't afford to chance it."
Rick presses a button on his watch, all doors and windows in the house are sealed off by blast shields.
Beth says: "Dad, why does our house have blast shields?"
Rick says: "Trust me, Beth, you don't wanna know how many answers that question has."

Nicky says: "L-let's get some fresh air."
Morty says: "Come on, cousin Nicky."

Morty says: "Cousin Nicky was a parasite?!"
Morty says: "!"
Rick says: "Six, Morty!"
Rick says: "There's supposed to be six of us!"
Rick says: "If there's seven, then that means somebody's not real."
Beth says: "But how did you know it was Nicky?"
Rick says: "I guessed."
Rick says: "That's why I aimed for his shoulder."
Beth says: "So we can't trust any of our memories now?"
Beth says: "Nicky was the reason we found that old nazi submarine."
Beth says: "Did that not even happen?"
Jerry says: "Well, of course it happened."
Nazi says: "Now that I possess the mighty staff of Rah-gubaba, the world will tremble before the Fourth Reich!"
Morty says: "This is the last time I ask you for help on my history final, Rick."
Nicky says: "Hey, we got a word for Nazis back in Brooklyn, pal."
Nazi says: "I'm comfortable being called a Nazi."
Nazi says: "You think there's some other word that will hurt my feelings?"

Return to the present.
Mr. Beauregard says: "Perhaps I'm biased, but if that story never happened, then I wouldn't still be the family butler."
Mr. Beauregard says: "dare to dream."
Rick says: "Wait."
Summer says: "And if Mr."
Summer says: "Beauregard wasn't our butler, it's safe to say the family'd be in a hell of a lot of trouble."
Rick says: "No!"
Rick says: "Don't flashback!"
Summer says: "You're just gonna make more swelling."
Beth says: "Don't worry, Jerry."

Beth says: "Beauregard."
Mr. Beauregard says: "Shall we, master Morty?"
Morty says: "We shall."
Beth says: "Oh, wait, don't leave without letting Photography Raptor take a picture."
Rick says: "Everybody stop remembering!"
Rick says: "These parasites are like bed bugs, and every flashback is another mattress."
Rick says: "Look!"
Rick says: "There's only supposed to be six people in this house."
But there's always been 10.
Rick says: "No!"
Rick says: "Uh, the fact that I wrote this number down means that there's four parasites."
Frankenstein says: "You sure about that, Rick?"
Mr. Beauregard says: "Begging your pardon, master Rick, but I seem to recall a great deal of confusion surrounding that number."
Rick says: "All right, there's six of us,  and that's it."
Rick says: "Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr."
Rick says: "Poopybutthole, Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary, Photography raptor, Mr."
Rick says: "Beauregard, and Summer."

Pencilvester says: "Use me!"

Mr. Poopybutthole says: "You're not in any of mine."
Summer says: "All I have are pictures of me and my friends from school."
Summer says: "What?"
Summer says: "What teenage girl has pictures of her family?"
Summer says: "It's not like we're Mormon or dying."
Frankenstein says: "I will admit it's suspicious that Summer's only friend is a magic ballerina lamb that we've never seen."

Summer says: "That means so am I."
Everyone except Rick apologizes to Summer.
Frankenstein says: "I was on the wrong side of the pitchfork on this one."
Jerry says: "Okay, look, we shouldn't need evidence or logic to know who's family and who isn't."
Jerry says: "I know who the Smiths are."
Jerry says: "I've known Beth since high school."
Jerry says: "And her husband, Sleepy Gary, is hands down my absolute best friend."

Sleepy Gary says: "What do you say we take down these blast shields?"
All says: "Yeah."
Rick says: "Can't do that, Sleepy Gary."
Rick says: "All right, everybody listen to me."
Rick says: "I don't know if any of you guys are real, but this house has been infested with fake loved ones that spread through fake memories, and our planet will be destroyed if they get out."
Pencilvester says: "But Rick, even you have to admit you do tend to overreact to stuff."
Flashback.
Rick says: "You guys, we got to hurry."
Rick says: "I just got back from Walmart."
Rick says: "They're selling Nintendo 3ds systems for $149."
Rick says: "99 on sale, plus every time you buy one, you get a $50 gift card."

Sleepy Gary says: "Rick, keep a level head, okay?"
Sleepy Gary says: "'Cause I'll tell you a secret about Frankenstein -- He's actually Frankenstein's monster."
Rick looks at Frankenstein, Frankenstein pounds his fist.
Jerry says: "Sleepy Gary, m-my head is filled with memories of our friendship."
Jerry says: "I'm convinced that you're Beth's husband and I'm your friend, but if those memories can't be trusted, then..."
Sleepy Gary says: "Jerry, just say it."

Sleepy Gary says: "Jesus, Jerry."
Sleepy Gary says: "No, you're real."
Sleepy Gary says: "Hey, look at me."

Gary drinks, Jerry drops his bottle. Both he and Gary reach for it and their hands meet. They look into each other's eyes.
Gary says: "Maybe we'll see Chewbacca."

CREDITS.
Mr. Poopybutthole is in a hospital doing physical therapy with a nurse as the family watches through a window. Beth is holding flowers.
Beth says: "Oh, he -- he's looking a lot better."
Rick says: "Listen, Beth, don't torture yourself."
Rick says: "I made a similar mistake years ago, but, you know, on a planetary scale."
Beth says: "Is, um, is he mad at me?"
Rick says: "He's not pressing charges."
Rick says: "I mean, that's got to be the "you shot me" equivalent of not being mad."
Nurse steps out of the room.
Beth says: "Can he have visitors?"
Doctor says: "He'd like to be alone."
Doctor says: "He told me to tell you he's sorry you didn't have bad memories of him?"
Doctor says: "If you love him, you should leave."
Smith family walks out of the hospital.
Rick says: "And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes."
