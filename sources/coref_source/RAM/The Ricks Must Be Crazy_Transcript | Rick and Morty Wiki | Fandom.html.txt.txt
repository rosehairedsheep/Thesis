Morty says: "Geez, I can't believe we found a version of Earth with a Ball Fondlers movie franchise."
Morty says: "Yeah, I'm pretty jealous."
Rick says: "Don't be Morty, there are pros and cons to every reality, fun facts about this one; it's got giant telepathic spiders, eleven 9/11's, aaaand the best ice cream in the multiverse!"
Summer says: "Shut up!"
Morty says: "W-whoa!"
Rick says: "We're gonna go get some ice-cream motherfuckers!"
Car does not start.
Rick says: "Oh great."
Morty says: "Oh boy."
Morty says: "W-what's wrong Rick, is it the quantum carburettor or something?"
Rick says: "Quantum carburettor?"
Rick says: "Jesus Morty; you can't just add a sci fi word to a car word and hope it means something."
Rick says: "Huh, it looks like something's wrong with the microverse battery - we're going to have to go inside."
Morty says: "Uhm."
Morty says: "Go inside what?"
Rick says: "The battery Morty."
Rick says: "Be right back Summer; stay put, don't touch any buttons, and ignore all random thoughts that feel -- spider-y."
Summer says: "Wait!"
Summer says: "You can't leave me here!"
Rick says: "You'll be fine."
Rick says: "Ship, keep Summer safe."
Ship says: "Keep."
Ship says: "Summer."
Ship says: "Safe."
Summer says: "Egh, wonderful."
Man with scar across his face and a ponytail approaches the car.
Man says: "Hey, excuse me, hello?"
Summer says: "Uhmm..."
Man says: "What you think you're better than me?"
Man says: "Nobody's better than me!"
Man says: "Ey!"
Man says: "ey!"
He is banging on the ship's window; the ship extends an arm from the back and cuts him into cubes with a laser.
Summer says: "Agh!"
Summer says: "Aghaaaa!"
Ship says: "Keep."
Ship says: "Summer."
Ship says: "Safe."
Thinner Man says: "Hey man, what the hell!"
Thinner Man says: "That was my daughter's paediatrician!"
Uagha!
The ship lifts him off the ground with an arm and prepares to kill him with another laser.
Summer says: "No!"
Summer says: "Stop, don't kill him!"
Ship beeps.
Ship says: "Confirmed."
Ship fires a single red laser into his back, and drops him to the ground.
Thinner Man says: "Uaghuu."
Thinner Man says: "Ugh."
Thinner Man says: "Uh."
Thinner Man says: "Oh God!"
Thinner Man says: "I can't feel my legs!"
Thinner Man says: "Help!"
Thinner Man says: "He-elp!"
Ship says: "Summer is safe."
Summer curls into fetal position and starts crying.
Summer says: "I don't feel safe."
Ship says: "Confirmed."
Thinner Man says: "Oh God help me!"
Thinner Man says: "Help me!"
Thinner Man says: "help me please!"
Thinner Man says: "You can help me."
Morty says: "Oh man."
Morty says: "Where are we Rick?"
Rick says: "Morty, remember eight seconds ago when -burp- when you said 'go inside what' and I said 'the battery' and then we showed up here?"
Rick says: "Morty, remember eight seconds ago when  when you said, "Go inside what?"
Rick says: "" And I said, "The battery"?"
Rick says: "And then we showed up here, and I wasn't like, "Whoa, this is unexpected."
Rick says: "This is not what I was expecting, Morty."
Rick says: "What a perplexing mystery this is."
Morty says: "All right, all right."
Morty says: "We're inside the battery."
Morty says: "I get it."
Morty says: "You don't have to bust my balls."
Rick says: "Huh, this isn't right."
Rick says: "This pipe's supposed to be sending 20 terawatts of juice up to the engine, Morty."
Computer beeps.
Rick says: "Instead we've got..."
Rick says: "zero?"
Rick says: "Now what are these people doing?"
Morty says: "W-w-w-whoa, people?"
Rick says: "It's time for some hands-on engine repair."
Rick says: "All right, Morty, hold on to something."
Morty says: "Whoa!"
Morty says: "Holy crap!"
Morty says: "I thought we were inside your car battery, Rick."
Morty says: "T-t-this is like a whole p-planet or something."
Rick says: "Thanks, Morty."
Rick says: "I'm pretty proud of this bad boy."
Rick says: "Check it out."
Keypad beeps.
Rick says: "I put a spatially tessellated void inside a modified temporal field until a planet developed intelligent life."
Rick says: "I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity, which they now generate on a global scale."
Rick says: "And, you know, some of it goes to power my engine and charge my phone and stuff."
Morty says: "You have a whole planet sitting around making your power for you?"
Morty says: "That's slavery."
Rick says: "It's society."
Rick says: "They work for each other, Morty."
Rick says: "They pay each other."
Rick says: "They buy houses."
Rick says: "They get married and make children that replace them when they get too old to make power."
Morty says: "That just sounds like slavery with extra steps."
Rick says: "Ooh-la-la, someone's gonna get laid in college."
Anchor says: "It appears we are being revisited by the alien known as Rick, who once gave our world the gift of gooble box technology, which, when stomped on, generates electricity, powering our homes and businesses, improving our daily lives, while safely removing the dangerous waste power to a special disposal volcano."
Anchor says: "But why has Rick returned?"
Anchor says: "And what will he say when he hears the big news?"
Anchor says: "Let's find out."
Morty says: "You need to tell these people they're in a battery, Rick."
Morty says: "It's messed up."
Morty says: "There's caterers down there."
Morty says: "Th-th-they're setting up chafing dishes."
Rick says: "Would you relax, Morty?"
Rick says: "There's nothing dishonest about what we're doing."
Rick says: "Now slap on these antennae."
Rick says: "These people need to think we're aliens."
Morty says: "What?"
Morty says: "Why?"
Rick says: "Obviously  know nothing about car repair."
Fanfare plays.
Rick says: "Wait for the ramp, Morty."
Rick says: "They love the slow ramp."
Rick says: "Really gets their dicks hard when they see this ramp just slowly extending down."
Cheering.
Rick says: "Greetings!"
Creatures chanting, "Rick! Rick!".
Rick says: "Morty, you got to flip them off."
Rick says: "I told them it means "Peace among worlds."
Rick says: "" How hilarious is that?"
Creatures cheering wildly.
Rick says: "Coming through."
Rick says: "Two real aliens walking through here."
Mr.President says: "Rick, our alien friend."
Rick says: "Uh, Mr."
Rick says: "President, um, couldn't help but notice that you were having problems generating power."
Mr.President says: "That's correct."
Mr.President says: "We've evolved."
Mr.President says: "Our most brilliant scientist, Zeep Xanflorp, has developed a source of energy that makes gooble boxes obsolete."
Rick says: "I would love to see it."
Mr.President says: "you."
Rick says: "What did you say to me?!"
Rick says: "!"
Mr.President says: "" you."
Mr.President says: "" Y-you told me it means "much obliged"."
Rick says: "Oh."
Rick says: "Right."
Rick says: "Uh, b-blow me."
Mr.President says: "No, no, no."
Mr.President says: "Blow me."
Mr.President says: "Zeep, you have an honored guest from beyond the stars."
Zeep says: "I said 12 quantum stabilizers, not 11."
Zeep says: "Fix it or it's your ass."
Zeep says: "Chris, I'm in the middle of something."
Mr.President says: "Zeep, is Rick-- The alien."
Mr.President says: "Rick the alien."
Mr.President says: "Rick the alien..."
Rick says: "Really?"
Rick says: "You're gonna pull that move?"
Rick says: "I guided your entire civilization."
Rick says: "Your people have a holiday named Ricksgiving."
Rick says: "They teach kids about me in school."
Zeep says: "I dropped out of school."
Zeep says: "It's not a place for smart people."
Morty says: "Ohhhh, snap!"
Mr.President says: "R-Rick was hoping to see your new energy source."
Mr.President says: "I think he could learn a lot from you, Zeep."
Zeep says: "Fine."
Zeep says: "It's hard for people to grasp, but inside that container is an infinite universe with a planet capable of generating massive amounts of power."
Zeep says: "I call it a miniverse."
Rick says: "name."
Zeep says: "Excuse me?"
Rick says: "Nothing."
Rick says: "I mean, it's hard for us to comprehend all this."
Rick says: "Would it be possible for us to get some kind of tour of your miniverse from the inside?"
Zeep says: "This isn't a  chocolate factory."
Zeep says: "I don't have time."
Mr.President says: "Didn't you say time goes more slowly in the miniverse relative to the real world?"
Zeep says: "Yes, Chris."
Zeep says: "Thanks for reminding me of that."
Zeep says: "Great president."
Zeep says: "All right, let's go."
Morty says: "Whoa-oh!"
Zeep says: "Hold on to something."
Zeep says: "I put an unbounded vacuum inside a temporal field until a world developed."
Zeep says: "I then introduced the people of this world to the wonders of electricity in the form of a device I call a flooble crank."
Zeep says: "What they don't know is that 80% of every crank's energy output gets channeled out of the miniverse to be used by us."
Zeep says: "No more gooble boxes."
Rick says: "I got to tell you, Zeep, with no disrespect, I really think what you're doing here is unethical."
Rick says: "It's not cool."
Morty says: "What?!"
Morty says: "!"
Rick says: "Y-y-you got the people on this world slaving away  making your power."
Rick says: "I mean, that's what I call slavery."
Rick says: "Well, that just sounds like slavery with extra steps."
Zeep says: "Eek barba dirkle, somebody's gonna get laid in college."
Morty says: "Rick, a word?"
Morty says: "What the hell was that?"
Rick says: "I know."
Rick says: ""Eek barba dirkle"?"
Rick says: "That's a pretty  up "ooh-la-la"."
Morty says: "No, what are you doing telling this guy that his miniverse is unethical?"
Morty says: "Do you not see the hypocrisy here?"
Rick says: "Holy crap."
Rick says: "You're right, Morty."
Rick says: "Hypocrisy."
Rick says: "Somewhere on this planet, there's got to be an arrogant scientist prick on the verge of microverse technology, which would threaten to make Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete, forcing Zeep to say microverses are bad, at which point he'll realize what a hypocrite he's being, his people will go back to stomping on their gooble boxes, and you and I will be on ice cream street, baby!"
Rick says: "Eating that mother ice cream!"
Rick says: "Slurping, slurping, slurping it up."
Rick says: "Wh-wh-why are you making that face?"
Morty says: "Holy Shit!"
Zeep says: "It's me."
Zeep says: "I've convinced the people of this planet that I'm a traveler from another world."
Rick says: "You don't think that's overdoing it a little?"
Rick says: "I mean, you could achieve the same effect with a pair of-- Never mind."
Rick says: "You know what?"
Rick says: "I shouldn't be so critical."
Rick says: "I'm an alien."
Zeep says: "Places, please."
Zeep says: "We're about to land."
Rick says: "Too fast."
Sirens wailing.
Ship says: "Law enforcement converging on location."
Ship says: "Keep Summer safe."
Summer says: "No!"
Summer says: "No, no!"
Summer says: "Don't hurt anybody!"
Ship says: "Confirm custom defense protocol-- Keep Summer safe-- No physical force."
Summer says: "Yes."
Ship says: "Processing."
Swat Officer 1 says: "Come out of the vehicle with your hands in the air!"
Ship says: "Scanning assailants."
Ship says: "Gestating."
Summer says: ""Gestating"?"
Swat Officer 1 says: "Come out with your hands up, or we will be forced to open fire!"
Swat Officer 1 says: "Incoming!"
Swat Officer 2 says: "We got a device!"
Swat Officer 1 says: "Bomb!"
Swat Officer 1 says: "Bomb!"
Kid says: "Daddy?"
Swat Officer 1 says: "Oh, my God."
Swat Officer 1 says: "Hunter?"
Kid says: "Daddy?"

Swat Officer 1 says: "Jesus Christ, cease fire!"
Swat Officer 1 says: "Stay back!"
Swat Officer 1 says: "H-h-hunter?"
Kid says: "Daddy."
Swat Officer 1 says: "Hunter!"
Swat Officer 1 says: "Oh, my dear, sweet God, Hunter."
Swat Officer 1 says: "Oh, my boy."
Swat Officer 1 says: "My boy."
Swat Officer 1 says: "I'm sorry."
Swat Officer 1 says: "I'm sorry."
Swat Officer 1 says: "It was all my fault."
Swat Officer 1 says: "I'm sorry."
Kid says: "Daddy, leave the car alone."
Swat Officer 1 says: "W-w-w-what?"
Kid says: "Leave the car alone."
Swat Officer 1 says: "Hunter?"
Summer says: "Oh, my God."
Swat Officer 1 says: "Stay here, Hunter!"
Swat Officer 1 says: "No!"
Swat Officer 1 says: "God, no!"
Swat Officer 1 says: "Hunter!"
Ship says: "All of you have loved ones."
Ship says: "All can be returned."
Ship says: "All can be taken away."
Ship says: "Please step away from the vehicle."
Ship says: "Keep Summer safe."
Zeep says: "And if you continue to turn your flooble cranks, I will bring you other great alien advancements."
Rick says: "Hey, uh, let me ask you something."
Teenyverse President says: "Yes?"
Rick says: "Any of your, uh, scientists working on anything new?"
Teenyverse President says: "All of them."
Teenyverse President says: "That's their job."
Rick says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Rick says: "But I mean, like, energy-wise."
Rick says: "Anyone working on, say, a little universe in a box?"
Teenyverse President says: "How do you know about that?"
Teenyverse President says: "It's top secret."
Zeep says: "So remember-- a crank a day is not nearly enough."
Zeep says: "Crank it."
Zeep says: "I told them this means "Peace among worlds"."
Zeep says: "How hilarious is that?"
Morty says: "Re-really funny, Zeep."
Rick says: "Hey, Zeep, the fake president of your fake world has something fake important to show you."
Kyle says: "It's not much now, but once I learn to accelerate the temporal field, I'll be able to interact with any sentient life that evolves and introduce them to the wonders of electricity via a pulley-based device I call a blooble yank."
Zeep says: "You'll be taking most of their energy."
Zeep says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Zeep says: "I get it."
Rick says: "time."
Zeep says: "You do realize this will make the flooble crank obsolete?"
Zeep says: "This is wrong, Kyle."
Zeep says: "What you're doing is wrong."
Zeep says: "You're basically-- This is slavery."
Zeep says: "You're talking about creating a planet of slaves."
Rick says: "Told you, Zeep."
Kyle says: "Oh, they won't be slaves."
Kyle says: "They'll work for each other and pay each other money."
Zeep says: "That just sounds like slavery with ex..."
Zeep says: "tra..."
Zeep says: "steps."
Rick says: "What?"
Zeep says: "Wait a minute."
Zeep says: "Did you create my universe?"
Zeep says: "Is my universe a miniverse?"
Rick says: "Microverse!"
Kyle says: "Uh, teenyverse."
Rick says: "Ugh!"
Rick says: "You b*st*rd!"
Zeep says: "Much obliged."
Kyle says: "What the hell is happening?"
Morty says: "This is healthy, trust me."
Rick says: "You're my battery, mother lobster tank!"
Rick says: "It's whack!"
Kyle says: "Are they not really aliens?"
Morty says: "Nah, they're just a couple of crazy, wacky scientists, you know?"
Kyle says: "So he made a universe, and that guy is from that universe."
Kyle says: "And that guy made a universe."
Kyle says: "And that's the universe where I was born."
Kyle says: "Where my father died."
Kyle says: "Where I couldn't make time for his funeral because I was working on my universe."
Rick says: "I made you!"
Morty says: "Yeah."
Morty says: "Science, huh?"
Morty says: "Ain't it a thing."
Morty says: "You know, one time, Rick sh-- accidentally shot his laser pistol right through my hand."
Morty says: "You know, I mean, like, old-lady science, you know?"
Morty says: "She's a real-- You got to hang on tight, you know?"
Morty says: "Because she-- she'll-- She bucks pretty hard."
Morty says: "Ooh, boy, what-- Oh, my God, no!"
Rick says: "Teenyverse."
Zeep says: "Teenyverse."
Rick says: "Come on, come on, come on."
Rick says: "Pterodactyl!"
Zeep says: "Asshole!"
Zeep says: "When I get out of this teenyverse, I'm gonna smash it to pieces with you in it."
Rick says: "Yeah, well, when I get out of this teenyverse, I'm gonna get out of the surrounding miniverse and then the microverse around that, and guess what?"
Morty says: "Don't make things worse, Rick!"
Morty says: "Uh, he's not gonna destroy your universe."
Morty says: "You know, we-- We need it to start our car."
Zeep says: "That's what you used my universe for?"
Zeep says: "To run your car?"
Rick says: "Yeah, but don't flatter yourself."
Rick says: "There's always AAA, you fucking cocksucker!"
Rick says: "What's he doing?"
Rick says: "What's he crafting?"
Rick says: "I can craft stuff, too, pal!"
Rick says: "Just like I crafted your reality!"
Zeep says: "Ow!"
Zeep says: "I crafted the guy that created the planet you're standing on!"
Rick says: "Yeah, and I made the stars that became the carbon in your mother's ovaries!"
Zeep says: "I didn't ask to be born!"
Morty says: "All right, that's it!"
Morty says: "I'm out."
Morty says: "I-I'm gonna go into the wilderness, and I'm gonna make a new life for myself among the tree people."
Morty says: "It can't be worse than this."
Rick says: "Sure."
Rick says: "Okay, Morty."
Rick says: "Just be back before sundown or the tree people will eat you."
Morty says: "That's a myth!"
Morty says: "W-w-why are you trying to start a myth?"
Rick says: "It's a prehistoric planet, Morty."
Rick says: "Someone has to bring a little culture."
Rick says: "And it certainly can't be someone whose entire culture powers my brake lights!"
Sirens wailing.
Army General says: "Go, go, go!"
Summer says: "Oh, my God."
Summer says: "Oh, God."
Summer says: "What are we going to do now?"
Ship says: "I am unable to destroy this army."
Ship says: "To clarify, I am quite able to destroy this army, but you will not permit it."
Summer says: "Correct."
Ship says: "You also refuse to authorize emotional countermeasures."
Summer says: "If you're talking about the melting ghost babies, yes, please, no more of that."
Ship says: "Confirmed."
Ship says: "I am currently constructing a security measure in compliance with your parameters."
Ship says: "But I do want to say you are not making this easy."
Summer says: "You know you're kind of a dick, right?"
Ship says: "My function is to keep Summer safe, not keep Summer being, like, totally stoked about, like, the general vibe and stuff."
Ship says: "That's you."
Ship says: "That's how you talk."
Rick says: "Hey, that's my deer!"
Zeep says: "Aaaaaaah!"
Rick says: "Raah!"
Zeep says: "I hope your God is as big a dick as you."
Rick says: "My God's the biggest dick that's never existed."
Rick says: "Why do you think I'm even here?"
Snake hisses.
Eagle screeches.
Zeep says: "You're here because you created someone smarter than you."
Rick says: "Oh, I thought we were both here because I created a universe of idiots."
Morty says: "Kalo kada sha la."
Rick says: "Holy shit."
Rick says: "Morty?"
Rick says: "I haven't seen you in months."
Rick says: "You're leading the tree people?"
Rick says: "Huh."
Rick says: "That's a step up."
Morty says: "We have no leaders."
Morty says: "We follow only the will of the forest."
Rick says: "Ooh."
Rick says: "Wow."
Rick says: "Gaaaaay."
Zeep says: "That is pretty gay."
Morty says: "You two call yourselves geniuses, but you have spent this time learning nothing."
Morty says: "Come with me into the forest."
Morty says: "There is something I wish to teach you."
Morty says: "This is Ku'ala, the spirit tree."
Morty says: "For generations, it has guided the-- You have to get us the fuck out of here."
Morty says: "These people are backwards savages."
Morty says: "They eat every third baby because they think it makes fruit grow bigger."
Morty says: "Everyone's gross, and they all smell like piss all the time."
Morty says: "I m-- I miss my family."
Morty says: "I miss my laptop."
Morty says: "I masturbated to an extra-curvy piece of driftwood the other day!"
Morty says: "Look, I don't care what it takes."
Morty says: "You two are putting aside your bullshit, and you're working together to get us back home."
Rick says: "No can do, Morty."
Rick says: "I just can't."
Morty says: "Ro ro dah no gah!"
Morty says: "You're smart."
Morty says: "You'll figure it out."
Guns cocking.
Army General says: "You have 10 seconds to get out of the ship!"
Army General says: "10, 9..."
Rick says: "All right, not bad."
Zeep says: "I guess you're an okay proto recombinator."
Rick says: "I've certainly seen worse ionic cell dioxination."
Zeep says: "If this works, drinks are on me."
Rick says: "If drinks are on you, you're gonna need a second mortgage on that tower."
Rick says: "I'm an alcoholic."
Zeep says: "Opium addict."
Both laugh.
Morty says: "All right, okay, okay, okay, wrap it up."
Morty says: "You guys are the  trees!"
Morty says: "Yes!"
Morty says: "You did it!"
Morty says: "Yes!"
Rick says: "Hey, uh, how about that drink?"
Zeep says: "Sure, I just need to go grab my wallet from inside my ship."
Rick says: "Is our wallet in your ship?"
Rick says: "That's where the transporter is, too, so why don't we come with?"
Zeep says: "It's cool."
Zeep says: "I'll be back in a sec."
Rick says: "You know how long a second can take in a microverse?"
Rick says: "Oh!"
Rick says: "Run, Morty!"
Rick says: "That asshole's willing to risk everything he cares about just to defeat me!"
Rick says: "He's psychotic!"
Both pant.
Rick says: "Morty, hop on my back."
Morty says: "Why?"
Rick says: "Go, go  Sanchez ski shoes."
Morty says: "Aaaaaah!"
Army General says: "..."
Army General says: "Eight..."
Panting.
Morty says: "Aaaah!"
Rick says: "Oof!"
All grunting.
Rick says: "Hold still."
Mr. President says: "Oh, hey, guys."
Mr. President says: "I just finished cooking us a feast."
Rick says: "Aaaah!"
Zeep says: "You monster!"
Mr. President says: "Whoa."
Mr. President says: "Bad tour."
Army General says: "..."
Army General says: "seven..."
Elevator bell dings.
Secretary says: "Hey, you got to sign out."
Rick says: "Nothing you do matters!"
Rick says: "Your existence is a lie!"
Secretary says: "If that were really true, then..."
Female Visitor says: "I'm here to see Ron Mendleson."
Secretary says: "Third floor."
Female Visitor says: "Uh, no."
Both panting.
Zeep says: "You may have created this universe, Rick, but I live in it."
Bleep.
Morty says: "What are we gonna do, Rick?"
Morty says: "We're so screwed."
Morty says: "He's gonna get to the ship and smash the microverse, and then he's gonna kill us!"
Rick says: "Quick, Morty, you've got to turn into a car."
Morty says: "What?!"
Morty says: "!"
Rick says: "A long time ago, I implanted you with a subdermal chip that could call upon dormant nanobots in your bloodstream to restructure your anatomy and turn you into a car."
Morty says: "Oh, my God!"
Rick says: "Concentrate, Morty."
Rick says: "Concentrate and turn into a car, Morty."
Rick says: "Never mind."
Rick says: "Here's a taxi."
Rick says: "Get in."
Rick says: "It's fine."
Army General says: "..."
Army General says: "six..."
Rick says: "Hey, Zeep."
Zeep says: "Huh?"
Rick says: "Happy Ricksgiving, biiiiiitch."
Zeep says: "Aaah!"
Rick says: "We did it, Morty."
Rick says: "Now let's get out of here and destroy this whole universe."
Taxi Driver says: "Excuse me?"
Army General says: "..."
Soldier says: "Sir?"
Spiders hiss.
Army General says: "Holy hell."
Soldier says: "Sir!"
Tires screech.
Human President says: "Hold you fire!"
Spider snarls.
Summer says: "What's going on?"
Ship says: "I have brokered a peace agreement between the giant spiders and the government."
Human President says: "Thanks to the skilled diplomacy of this mysterious space car, from this day forward, human- and spiderkind will live side by side in peace."
Human President says: "We will stop bombing them, and they will no longer use their telepathic abilities to make us wander into webs for later consumption."
Human President says: "Instead, we will work together to make this world a better place for all, no matter how many legs."
Soldier says: "What do we do about the space car?"
Human President says: "Leave it alone."
Human President says: "I mean, what did it really do, anyways?"
Human President says: "Kill a guy and paralyze his buddy?"
Human President says: "Not a bad trade for spider peace."
Army General says: "."
Army General says: "All right, that's it."
Army General says: "Move out!"
Human President says: "I love this spider!"
Ship says: "Summer is safe."
Summer says: "All right, I get it."
Zeep says: "Rick!"
Thunder crashes.
Morty says: "Don't do it."
Rick says: "You quit school, but you still got some learning to do."
Zeep says: "Aah!"
Rick says: "Unh!"
Snorts, spits.
Rick says: "Class dismissed."
Morty says: "Geez."
Bottles clatter.
Rick says: "You all right?"
Rick says: "Uh-huh!"
Morty says: "What are you doing, Rick?"
Morty says: "I'm pretty sure the battery's dead."
Rick says: "Oh, you think so, huh, Morty?"
Rick says: "Well, let's see."
Engine turns over.
Morty says: "Hey, wait-- huh?"
Morty says: "I don't get it."
Rick says: "Of course you don't."
Rick says: "But Zeep did."
Rick says: "He knew that once I got back to my car, one of two things was gonna happen-- I was gonna have to toss a broken battery, or the battery wouldn't be broken."
Zeep says: "Peace among worlds, Rick."
Morty says: "Jesus."
Rick says: "Yeah."
Rick says: "Listen to that baby purr."
Rick says: "You were right, Morty-- We really just needed to be honest with those guys."
Rick says: "All right, here we go."
Rick says: "Thank y-o-o-ou."
Rick says: "See, Morty?"
Rick says: "This is what it's all about."
Rick says: "This is why we do what we do."
Morty says: "Uh-huh."
Rick says: "Ew!"
Rick says: "What the hell?"
Rick says: "Jesus!"
Rick says: "There's flies in my ice cream."
Ice cream clerk says: "Presidential decree-- All ice cream is now for all beings, no matter how many legs."
Rick says: "What the fuck did you do, Summer?!"
Rick says: "!"
Summer says: "It was your ship!"
