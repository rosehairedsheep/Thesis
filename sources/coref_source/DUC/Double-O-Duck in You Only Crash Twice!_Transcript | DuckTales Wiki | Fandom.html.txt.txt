Scrooge says: "Now you want me to stay here?"
Webby says: "You know, Uncle Scrooge, I've always wanted to introduce you to the Captain's Quarters Arcade."
Webby says: "Come on!"
Dewey says: "All right, LP."
Dewey says: "Let's jack in and reboot their butts."
Launchpad says: "I don't know."

Black Heron says: "I made the dumb rat smart."
Steelbeak says: "Oooh, I see."
Steelbeak says: "What you got there is a smart rat ray."
Steelbeak says: "Why didn't you just say that?"
Black Heron says: "But if I could reverse this beam, I could use this weapon to make Scrooge McDuck dumber than the dummies!"
Black Heron says: "Ahahaha!"
Black Heron says: "Any questions?"
Steelbeak says: "Did the rat make that jumpsuit on a regular sewing machine or did it build it on its own tiny sewing machine?"
Black Heron says: "Just get rid of them, stupid."
Steelbeak says: "I'm not stupid."
Steelbeak says: "I'll go."
Steelbeak says: "Not 'cause you told me, but because there's no trap like a steel trap."
Black Heron says: "GO!"
Steelbeak says: "Y'know, 'cause my beak, it's made of steel."

Launchpad says: "All right."
Launchpad says: "Okay bud, you can do this."
Dewey says: "Okay, I'll have your back this time so nothing goes wrong."
Dewey says: "Remember, we say the passcode, win the card game, locate the villain's lair, once there, find the secret weapon, save the world, then we get pizza!"

Black Heron says: "The Intelli-Ray, I just explained it to you."
Black Heron says: "Ugh, I'll just show you."
Steelbeak says: "Of course!"
Steelbeak says: "With this, we can make Scrooge so hungry he'll eat all the world's toy!"
Black Heron says: "What?"
Black Heron says: "No, it's not making them hungry, they're dumb."
Black Heron says: "Wait, where are the ducks?"
Steelbeak says: "Relax, they think they're in a game."
Steelbeak says: "I put them in one of the holding cells."
Steelbeak says: "And yes, I did put them in those flashy prisoner jumpsuits."

Launchpad says: "Band things together, they go stretchy, they snap really hard..."
Launchpad says: "."
Launchpad says: "What am I missing?"
Launchpad says: "I see a wall, door, glass, and..."
Launchpad says: "floor."
Launchpad says: "Ugh, what does it all mean?"
Dewey says: "Wow, the solution is to build a tiny plane and teach a mouse to fly it?"
Launchpad says: "Yes, I figured that out."
Dewey says: "I'm sorry I doubted you, LP, you're getting the hand of this."
Dewey says: "Now we've got to find the villain's secret weapon."
Black Heron says: "I should've let you rotting in that prison cell in St."
Black Heron says: "Cannard."
Black Heron says: "After I sort this out, I'm reporting you to High Command."
Steelbeak says: "Easy, Heron."
Steelbeak says: "That's no way to talk to your partner."
Black Heron says: "Partner?"
