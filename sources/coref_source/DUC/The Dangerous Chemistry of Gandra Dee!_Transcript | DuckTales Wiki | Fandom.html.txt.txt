Opens with a storm in Duckburg says: "Atmoz: Ha, ha, ha!"
a villian cackling to the sky says: "Atmoz: Ha, ha, ha!"
Gizmoduck says: "Dr."
Gizmoduck says: "Atmoz Fear!"
Gizmoduck says: "It's time I- uh, rain on your parade."
Dr. Atmoz says: "Ha, you're not even trying anymore."
Gizmoduck says: "I'm sorry, you're my third weather based villian this month."
Gizmoduck says: "In between the crime sprees and the public service and the..."
Gizmoduck says: "One second."
Gizmoduck says: "Hello?"
Gizmoduck says: "Oh hi, Huey."
Gizmoduck says: "No, no don't reschedule, I need a break."
Dr. Atmoz says: "You're too busy to finish telling me how busy you are?"
Dr. Atmoz says: "Gizmoduck, you're burned out!"
Gizmoduck says: "It's time I rain on your parade!"
Dr. Atmoz says: "You literally just said that."
Gizmoduck says: "Ugh, I'm sorry."
Theme song plays.
Open to Huey and Webby standing in front of a store called "Ray's Electronics," Webby watches the televisions in the store window.
Webby says: "So..."
Webby says: "Where is this friend?"
Huey says: "Oh!"
Huey says: "Fenton is..."
Huey says: "Very busy..."
Huey says: "Working..."
Huey says: "On robotics!"
Overhead, we see Gizmoduck flying above Huey, crash-landing in a nearby alleyway. Several garbage cans clatter and a cat hisses in fright.
Fenton says: "Sorry I'm late!"
Huey says: "Fenton!"
Huey says: "There ya are!"
Huey says: "You just missed a Gizmoduck fly-by!"
Webby says: "You're Gizmoduck!"
Fenton says: "Huey!"
Huey says: "I didn't say anything!"
Webby says: "Hi, I'm Webby!"
Webby says: "Nice to see you!"
Webby says: "Does your suit have a toilet?!"
Webby says: "!"
Fenton pulls a journal out of his bag. He opens it to a page that reads "People who know I'm Gizmoduck." The list consists of 'Gyro , Launchpad , Dewey , Huey, Beaks , Scrooge , the mailman, the dry cleaner, that barista at Starducks, everyone who lives on my block.' He adds Webby's name to said list.
Fenton says: "No matter."
Fenton says: "Heroing is well and good, but today is about science!"
Fenton says: "About Fenton Crackshell-Cabrera peeling back the veil of the unknown to make a discovery so revolutionary that I'll remembered as more than just..."
A wall of TVs is playing various news stations reporting on Gizmoduck's heroisms. Fenton stands in front of them and frowns.
Huey says: "Poor Fenton's worn out from saving the day everyday!"
Webby says: "The tragic hero who cares for everyone..."
Webby says: "But himself..."
Fenton says: "Excuse me, I'm looking for your latest birefringent beam splitters?"
Gandra says: "Beam splitters, huh?"
Gandra says: "Cubic or dichroic mirror?"
Fenton says: "Huh?"
Fenton says: "You know about dichroic mirror splitters?"
Gandra says: "Yes..."
Gandra says: "Because I'm a scientist."
Gandra says: "High-energy physics can be challenging for a rookie."
Fenton says: "Oh I'm no rookie!"
Fenton says: "I-I'm a scientist with McDuck enterprises, actually!"
Gandra says: "Oh..."
Gandra says: "Sell-out science!"
Gandra says: "Pushing pencils, wearing a suit!"
Gandra says: "Brain-storming the next Gizmoduck, like we need anymore of that show-off."
Fenton says: "W-wh, wait, I– What is it you do?"
Gandra says: "Uh..."
Gandra says: "Shatter expectations?"
Gandra says: "I have no rules, no limits, I don't kiss up to zillionaires, I work for myself!"
Fenton says: "Actually, I'm working on my own project that's pretty neat."
Fenton says: "I haven't quite cracked the equation yet but it's still very dangerous."
Fenton says: "The most dangerous kind of neat."
Fenton says: "Grrr..."
Fenton says: "."
Gandra says: "Alright 'suit', you're doing hard science?"
Gandra says: "Show me your lab!"
Fenton says: "Uh..."
Fenton says: "Yes."
Fenton says: "My lab."
Fenton says: "T-that is mine."
Fenton says: "I'll pick you up at 7:00 for some severe..."
Fenton says: "sciencing."
The focus blurs, and then zooms out to reveal that Webby and Huey are watching Gandra and Fenton banter through a nearby camera on a tripod.
Webby says: "Are they..."
Webby says: "fighting?"
Huey says: "Oh Webby."
Huey says: "This is the standard romantic courting of adults, commonly known as a "meet-cute."
Webby says: "Are you sure?"
Webby says: "Fenton looks awfully sweaty."
Huey says: "Anxious perspiration, intense eye contact, coy body language."
Huey says: "Only thing we haven't seen is the awkward yet adorable accident."
Gandra says: "Do you want my name or address or..."
Gandra says: "any..."
Gandra says: "means of contact?"
Fenton says: "Uh, yes, of course, all of it!"
Huey says: "Love is in the air!"
Gandra takes Fenton's phone and puts in her contact info. She hands it back to him, having put in her contact information as "Gandra D scientist emoji sparkle emoji".
Gandra says: "It's Gandra."
Gandra says: "Gandra Dee."
Cut to a television in Fenton's room at home, playing the news. Duckburg reporter Roxanne Featherly is on said TV.
Fenton says: "So..."
Fenton says: "The yellow, or the yellow?"
Webby says: "You need something more formal, like a tux!"
Webby says: "Ooh!"
Webby says: "Or a fancy cloak!"
Fenton says: "I have a lab coat."
Huey says: "You have to dress to impress!"
Huey says: "Eh?!"
Huey says: "!"
Fenton says: "Guys, this is just a meeting of the minds, that could turn into a flirtation that could then blossom into a loving relationship for as long as we both shall live!"
Fenton says: "..."
Fenton says: "But I don't want to come on too strong, so not a date."
Huey says: "A night of romance is just the break you need!"
Webby says: "And, if things don't go well, you could always reveal that you're Gizmoduck!"
Fenton says: "NO Gizmo!"
Fenton says: "Just Fenton."
Huey says: "We'll take care of everything."
Huey says: "The lab will be perfect for your DAAaaAAaaATE!"
Fenton says: "Not a date!"
The bedroom door bursts open says: "Officer Cabrera: What's this about a date?"
Fenton, Webby, and Huey rush to hide the Gizmoduck Helmet as quickly as possible and try to maintain the most casual pose possible.
Fenton says: "It's a little lab session with a peer."
Fenton says: "I should just be myself, right M'ma?"
Officer Cabrera says: "Oh no, Never be yourself on a first date."
Officer Cabrera says: "Or a second."
Officer Cabrera says: "Or any dates."
Officer Cabrera says: "You have to be the best version of yourself."
Cut to Launchpad driving with Fenton in Scrooge's car.
Launchpad says: "So, what's this big date?"
Fenton says: "Not a date."
Launchpad says: "Right, of course!"
Launchpad says: "But if it was, I say it good to see you find that special someone."
Launchpad says: "And someone can be many things!"
Launchpad says: "A friend, a confidant, a deadly ninja, a forbidden mermaid, a were-duck, a clone of youself..."
Launchpad stops, where Fenton should met Gandra.
Launchpad says: "A viking shield maiden, a talking cloud of energy that one time..."
Fenton go out of the car.
Fenton says: "Greetings!"
Gandra says: "Nice upgrade suit, yeah you're definitely the bad boy of science."
Gandra says: "Let's take your limo, mine is in the shop."
Gandra and Fenton go in the limozine.
Launchpad says: "Get comfy!"
Launchpad says: "I'll have you at your date at no time!"
Fenton gasps.
Fenton says: "You know, there's no pressure."
Fenton says: "This doesn't have to be a date!"
Gandra says: "You don't want this to be a date?"
Fenton says: "No, it can't be!"
Fenton says: "I mean, I just wanted to have it what you want it to be!"
Fenton says: "We're just..."
Fenton says: "two minds melding!"
Launchpad says: "Woof..."
Launchpad turns of the radio.
Radio music says: "It's a date."
Radio music says: "Don't let him trick you, no..."
Gandra and Fenton arrives.
Fenton says: "My intern should be prepping the lab right now!"
Fenton says: "It's a very professional work environment!"
Huey opens the door for Gandra and Fenton, and they go in to a room with a romantic table and a heart festoon. Huey is wearing a servant outfit.
Huey says: ": Benvenuti!"
Huey says: "Welcome to Jetta Scorpios, a place for romance!"
Huey says: "Prego, prego, prego!"
Huey says: "Please follow me."
Li'l bulb go under a lampshade on the table.
Gandra says: "This is your lab?"
Gandra says: "How do you get anything done with all this moody, Italian decor?"
Fenton says: "He he, yeah, this is not..."
Webby go to the table, also in a servant outfit.
Webby says: "Buongiorno, can I tell you about the tonight's special?"
Webby says: "It's spaghetti!"
Webby says: "Please order it, it's the only thing we made."
Fenton says: "Where is Dr."
Fenton says: "Gearloose?"
Webby says: "Oh, we took good care of him."
Gyro is closed in another room in the labratory and shouting.
Gandra says: "What was that?"
Fenton says: "The, uh, Crackshell-Cabrera talking closet!"
Fenton says: "Uh, will you 'scuce me a second?"
Fenton going with Webby and Huey away from Gandra.
Fenton says: "This is a disaster!"
Fenton says: "She's not into romance accoutrement!"
Fenton says: "She's into science!"
Huey says: "According to the JWG, mood is essential, without it how will you to develope chemistry?"
Fenton says: "With actual chemistry!"
While Fenton is talking with the kids, Gandra gets a call from Mark Beaks, and go where Fenton can't hear it.
Gandra says: "Argh, what do you want?"
Mark Beaks says: "Hey, so I don't like you not answering my calls, it makes feel like I'm not the only person in the world, which is just weird for me?"
Gandra says: "I'm inside the lab, okay?"
Mark Beaks says: "I want results, Agent Dee!"
Gyro says: "YOU IMBECILES, IT'S A TRAP!"
Ganda says: "A real scientist always gets results."
Fenton says: "We need to get rid of this stuff!"
Fenton says: "Is this spaghetti tied up together?"
Huey says: "You're supposed to eat it, then meet in the middle for a kiss."
Webby says: "And I'll be ready to capture that tender moment."
Huey says: "End of the night, we hand out souvenir photos."
Fenton says: "Just science, and me, and her, and..."
Fenton says: "the moonlight..."
Gandra says: "Beaks, stop calling!"
Gandra says: "The serum I made won't work unless I can get a recording of Fenton saying the passcode: blathering blatherskite."
Gandra says: "Those are not everyday words."
Beaks says: "I CAN'T WAIT!"
Beaks says: "I'm sick of Gizmoduck always getting the attention."
Beaks says: "Gah, he thinks he's SOOO NOBLE!"
Gandra says: "Just be patient!"
Beaks says: "Beaks..."
Beaks says: "."
Beaks says: "do not do patient."
Fenton says: "Sorry about my intern's odd behaviour."
Fenton says: "They're still under the effects of a..."
Fenton says: "toxic gas leak..."
Fenton says: "that I assure you has now been vented."
Gandra says: "Been there."
Gandra says: "Once I accidentally unleashed a nanobot investation on my apartement building."
Fenton says: "Holy marconi!"
Gandra says: "I tried to explain a protonic reversal could negate the receptors, but..."
Gandra says: "people don't wanna listen to science."
Fenton says: "A kook..."
Gandra says: "A menace..."
Fenton says: "A crackpot..."
Gandra says: "A crackpot..."
Fenton says: "Miss Dee, Shall we science?"
Fenton says: "Tasty spray!"
Fenton says: "Just spray any food with this and it tastes just like glazed donuts, like so."
Fenton says: "Mm, glazy."
Fenton says: "Mmm..."
Fenton says: "?"
Gandra says: "What if you don't like glazed donuts?"
Fenton says: "What kinda monster doesn't like glazed donuts?"
Gandra says: "You really wanna see something?"
Gandra says: "Look into my eyes."
Huey says: "Yes, it's happening..."
Gandra says: "Eye-bots, upgrades the eye into a wireless camera."
Fenton says: "Well, set those eye-bots on this..."
Fenton says: "The universal solvent!"
Fenton says: "The future of terraforming as we know it."
Fenton says: "This liquid eats through anything, only the strongest diamonds are resistant."
Gandra says: "So..."
Gandra says: "Rich boss McDuck gets to gobble up all of the Earth's precious gems for himself?"
Gandra says: "What next, some kind of gold magnet?"
Gandra says: "Here, take my hand."
Gandra says: "Do you feel that spark?"
Fenton says: "What was that?!"
Fenton says: "!"
Gandra says: "Nanites, microscopic robots."
Gandra says: "They channel my body's electricity into usable external power."
Fenton says: "You experimented on yourself."
Fenton says: "That's incredibly dangerous!"
Gandra says: "I know!"
Gandra says: "Most of these pencil pushers just theorize and talk..."
Gandra says: "Uh, what's the word?"
Fenton says: "Yadda-yadda?"
Fenton says: "Blah-blah-blah?"
Fenton says: "Babbling?"
Fenton says: "Blathering?"
Beaks says: "Ugh..."
Beaks says: "Just one word..."
Beaks says: "Argh, this is taking forever!"
Beaks says: "Okay, clearly papa needs to take matters into his own hands."
Beaks says: "Drop the beaks!"
Security system says: "Acces denied."
Beaks says: "What, no signal?!"
Beaks says: "!"
Beaks says: "Boo!"
Fenton says: "Okay, you want punk science?"
Fenton says: "You want ripping-the-fabric-of-the-universe-and-bending-the-elements-to-your-very-will?"
Fenton says: "My top secret personal project..."
Fenton says: "Behold!"
Fenton says: "Fentonium, a frictionless synthetic crystal of my own design."
Fenton says: "Instead of slowing down after an initial bounce, it actually speeds up and gains energy..."
Gandra says: "Ada Dovelace, that's amazing!"
Gandra says: "Imagine that potential unleashed..."
Fenton says: "..."
Fenton says: "And incredibly unstable!"
Fenton says: "I still need to crack the equation or it could tear the lab apart."
Fenton says: "An innovative generator from a mild-mannered source."
Fenton says: "Like I said, neat right?"
Gandra says: "Yeah, you kinda are..."
Gandra says: "Hungry, suit?"
Huey says: "Okay, okay, they're hungry."
Huey says: "Let's move, people!"
Huey says: "Webby, camera."
Huey says: "Manny, Bulb, music."
Huey says: "Me, Huey, food."
Huey says: "Order up!"
Huey says: "It's really working!"
Webby says: "The spaghetti got untied!"
Huey says: "Fenton's perfect date!"
Webby says: "I need a distraction."
Huey Singing in italian.
Webby says: "Gandra's a spy for Mark Beaks!"
Webby says: "This is all about her trying to get some passcode from Fenton."
Huey says: "WHAT?!"
Huey says: "!"
Huey says: "There's nothing in the romance chapter about spies."
Huey says: "Oh, this is gonna shatter Fenton's self-esteem..."
Webby says: "Also he could be captured by SPIES!"
Huey says: "TWO BAD THINGS COULD HAPPEN!"
Huey says: "Excuzi, you have a phone call..."
Fenton says: "Guys, it's going really well."
Fenton says: "Gandra's brilliant, and charming, and a little critical just like my mother and Gyro and pretty much everyone else in my life."
Fenton says: "Most of all, Gandra doesn't care about Gizmoduck."
Fenton says: "She likes me!"
Fenton says: "..."
Fenton says: "Aaaand you guys are just staring, why are you staring?"
Huey says: "Um, you're..."
Huey says: "looking good out there, tiger!"
Webby says: "Huey!"
Webby says: "We have some bad news..."
Gandra says: "You know, I wasn't so sure about you, but..."
Gandra says: "I like this."
Fenton says: "You sure you wouldn't want anything else?"
Fenton says: "I SPY the server right there I can WADDLE over and get his attention."
Gandra says: "Oh, uh..."
Gandra says: "No-no-no-no..."
Gandra says: "But, hey, what about a second date?"
Gandra says: "We can do a picnic, or get some fresh air, go fly a..."
Gandra says: "Oh, what are those things called?"
Gandra says: "The toy that Ben Frankloon tied to a key?"
Fenton says: "I know what you're here for: Gizmoduck!"
Fenton says: "Just like everyone else."
Fenton says: "There's a feeling man with feelings under that synthetic alloy shell!"
Gandra says: "You whaaat..."
Gandra says: "?"
Gandra says: "You're..."
Gandra says: "Gizmoduck?"
Fenton says: "You know I am, who doesn't?"
Fenton says: "Blathering blatherskite."
Gizmoduck says: "Is this what you want?!"
Gizmoduck says: "!"
Beaks says: "That's exactly what I want."
Beaks says: "You may have the suit, but I have something better: a full body upgrade!"
Beaks says: "That's right, I drank Dee's nanite serum and linked it up with stolen gizmotech."
Beaks says: "I just needed your passcode to boot it up."
Fenton recording.
Blathering blatherskite.
Beaks says: "Eugh, this feels gross!"
Beaks says: "This is normal, right?"
Beaks says: "Right?!"
Beaks says: "!"
Gandra says: "Did you drank more than one of the serum vials?"
Beaks says: "Yes, I told you I was bored!"
Beaks says: "Bigger than Gizmoduck, it's..."
Beaks says: "MEGA BEAKS!"
Beaks says: "..."
Beaks says: "Oh, and you're all incredibly DEAD."
Beaks says: "Alright."
Beaks says: "Which huge muscle should I use to destroy what first?"
Gizmoduck says: "You've always been a monster, but now you are a LITERAL monster..."
Beaks says: "Wait, did I just ate the pie tins?"
Beaks says: "Eugh, yuck, glazed donuts!"
Gizmoduck says: "Go!"
Gizmoduck says: "Find cover!"
Huey says: "This date is a disaster!"
Huey says: "Fenton's gonna be crushed..."
Webby says: "FENTON'S GOING TO BE CRUSHED!"
Beaks says: "Ahaha!"
Beaks says: "Hi, amigo."
Gizmoduck says: "Bye, Beaksie."
Gandra says: "Sorry, suit."
Beaks says: "I've got your kids!"
Beaks says: "..."
Beaks says: "Maybe, I'm not sure how this family works."
Beaks says: "But don't think about following me!"
Gandra says: "Ugh, that idiot!"
Fenton says: "So I'm the suit?!"
Fenton says: "!"
Fenton says: "You're the one working for Beaks!"
Gandra says: "I work for myself!"
Gandra says: "I just..."
Gandra says: "use him for funding and resources."
Fenton says: "For what?"
Fenton says: "Is any of this real?!"
Fenton says: "!"
Fenton says: "What are you?!"
Fenton says: "!"
Gandra says: "A scientist, free of responsibility."
Gandra says: "And look, for what it's worth..."
Gandra says: "You're a good scientist."
Fenton says: "And you're a crook."
Fenton says: "Come on, come on, come on..."
Fenton says: "Okay, you don't have the suit, what can you do?"
Fenton says: "Think Fenton, think..."
Beaks says: "AHAHA, HASHTAG MAKE IT RAIIIIIIIIN!"
Webby says: "How is this a part of your plan?!"
Webby says: "!"
Beaks says: "I wanted to up my visibility."
Beaks says: "You don't get more visible than being a giant monster!"
Huey says: "You ruined Fenton's date!"
Huey says: "WHERE IS YOUR HEART, MAN?!"
Huey says: "!"
Beaks says: "In here somewhere, under all these RIGHTOUS PACKS!"
Beaks says: "PLA-PLAW!"
Beaks says: "Ow!"
Beaks says: "Ow!"
Beaks says: "Who's doing that?!"
Beaks says: "!"
Fenton says: "Call me..."
Fenton says: "Fenton!"
Beaks says: "Wow, I never actually caught a ball before."
Beaks says: "Well, WHO'S THE LOSER NOW, COACH DAD?!"
Beaks says: "!"
Fenton says: "Gandra?!"
Fenton says: "!"
Gandra says: "Hurting puny, helpless heroes was not part of our deal, Beaks!"
Fenton says: "Gonna focus on the 'hero' much?"
Fenton says: "Are you okay?"
Gandra says: "I..."
Gandra says: "I can't shock him anymore!"
Gandra says: "His nanite-enhanced skin is too tough!"
Fenton says: "Yeah, but what matters is inside."
Fenton says: "Under all that, he's still the same weak, ego-fueled dweeb!"
Gandra says: "Ugh, heroes..."
Gandra says: "Always with the morals..."
Fenton says: "No, I mean inside, he's weak!"
Fenton says: "You can stop beaks, look!"
Fenton says: "You're trending worldwide!"
Beaks says: "I wanna see, I wanna see!"
Beaks says: "I can't use a phone..."
Beaks says: "I CAN'T USE A PHONE!"
Beaks says: "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
Webby says: "Fenton did it!"
Webby says: "And without the Gizmoduck armor!"
Huey says: "Webby, there is no Gizmoduck without the noble Fenton underneath- AAAAAAAAAAH!"
Huey says: "I WANNA COME DOWN, HEEEEEEEEEELP!"
Fenton says: "Oh no, the kids!"
Fenton says: "Gandra, we gotta-  Huh?"
Fenton says: "Wait, she did it!"
Huey says: "READY TO COME DOWN ANYTIME NOW!"
Fenton says: "Stabilization up 53%!"
Gyro says: "You."
Gyro says: "What do you think you're doing here?"
Gyro says: "Shouldn't you be Gizmoduck-ing around out there?"
Fenton says: "Not today, I'm needed here."
Fenton says: "Scientist at work."
Gyro says: "Wh-WHAT HAPPENED HERE?!"
Gyro says: "!"
