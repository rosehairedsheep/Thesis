Dewey says: "Della's not here."
Dewey says: "I think she was attacked."
Dewey says: "Ew!"
Donald says: "Attacked by a case of the munchies."
Donald says: "It's just jelly."
Dewey says: "What would you have done if it wasn't?"
Donald says: "Ah, why is Della making such a big deal out of this?"
Donald says: "She packed way too much food."
Donald says: "She brought a family-sized tent that she couldn't even set up by herself."

Dewey says: "How do you explain this?"
Donald says: "Well, that is weird."
Donald says: "Ow."
Donald says: "Ow."
Donald says: "Ow!"
Dewey says: "So Della must take you on awesome adventures all the time, huh?"
Donald says: "Ah please, I'm a little too mature for adventures with my sister."
Donald says: "I'm more of the soulful devil-may-care loner type."
Dewey says: "Oh, totally, me too."
Donald says: "Ahh!"
Dewey says: "But Della is amazing, right?"
Dewey says: "I mean, why wouldn't you want to go on a Christmas adventure with her?"
Donald says: "She wanted me to, but well, why aren't you with your family?"
Dewey says: "The answer to that is complicated, and full of paradoxes."
Donald says: "Ah, Della's tracks end here, but the others keep going."
Dewey says: "Maybe he gave her a piggyback ride?"
Donald says: "I gave Della this scarf last Christmas."
Donald says: "She never would have left it behind a mess."
Donald says: "That's not Santa Claus."
Wendigo says: "Wendigo!"
Donald Dewey says: "Aahhh!!"

Donald says: "I am a solo act."
Wendigo says: "Wendigo!"
Dewey says: "What is that thing?"
Della says: "I guess a wendigo."
Della says: "Legend has it that they're poor souls turned into monsters by obsession and desperation."
Donald says: "Hurry up, and get us down Dumb-bella!"
Della says: "No, not until you apologize."
Donald says: "For what?"
Della says: "Wrong answer."
Dewey says: "Donald!"
Donald says: "Okay, I'm sorry I called you Dumb-bella."
Della says: "Try again."
Donald says: "Oh okay."
Donald says: "Sorry I used your toothbrush to clean my combat boots."
Della says: "You did what?"
Della says: "You don't even know what you did wrong."
Della says: "Typical Donald."
Donald says: "How could I have done anything wrong?"
Donald says: "I haven't seen you all night."
Dewey says: "That's what you did wrong."
Dewey says: "That's why she packed the extra food, and the family-sized tent, and left her scarf behind for you to follow her."
Dewey says: "She didn't care about finding Santa."
Dewey says: "She just wanted to spend Christmas with you, but you're too caught up in you own thing to notice."
Dewey says: "Locked up in your own room."
Dewey says: "Ignoring everybody, and I have a lot of apologizing to do when I get back."
Donald says: "Della, I'm sorry, okay?"
Donald says: "I shouldn't have ditched you on Christmas."
Della cuts them down.
Dewey says: "Uagh, Oof!"
Della says: "All right ugly."
Della says: "What do you want?"
Wendigo says: "Wendigo!"
Wendigo says: "Scrooge!"

Donald says: "Wahoo!"
Donald says: "Quackarooni!"
Dewey says: "Now what?"
The kids drag Wendigo to the front of the mansion.
Donald says: "Um, listen Della."
Donald says: "I really am sorry."
Donald says: "I promise we'll never spend another Christmas apart."
Della says: "Thanks for helping us back there."
Della says: "Uh, this is weird."
Dewey says: "Sorry."
Dewey says: "I've just always wanted to spend Christmas with my..."
Dewey says: "fifteenth step-cousin on my great-grandmother's niece's side, that was it."
Della says: "You're a relative from the future, aren't you?"
Dewey says: "What?"
Dewey says: "No!"
Donald says: "Uh uh, please."
Donald says: "We're the Duck family."
Della says: "This is only like the fourth weirdest thing that's happened to us on Christmas."
Donald says: "No!"
Donald says: "Keep your mouth shut."
Della says: "You can't warn us about our future."
Della says: "You'll disrupt the time stream."
Donald says: "Haven't you ever seen any movie?"
Dewey says: "Oh yeah."
Della says: "Stay here."
Della says: "We'll go get Uncle Scrooge to take care of the beast."
Wendigo says: "Scrooge!"
Scrooge says: "Here, you nostalgic night terror."
Dewey says: "Uncle Scrooge?"
Scrooge says: "I was flying these two back home through time, when I spotted you down here."
Scrooge says: "What in blazes are you doing here?"
Dewey says: "Can we please just go back to our family?"
Wendigo's outer shell crumbles to reveal...
Present says: "Past?"
Scrooge says: "Wendigos: poor souls turned into monsters by obsession and desperation."
Scrooge says: "He's been lost in these woods this whole time."
Scrooge says: "Every Christmas eve, waiting for me."
Scrooge says: "I'm going to give an old friend a present."
Scrooge says: "No one gets left behind on Christmas."
Past says: "You mean it?"
Past says: "Take heed, rise, and walk with me."
Kids says: "Whoh, ha ha ha."
Donald says: "Welcome back."
Kids says: "Woo hoo!"
Kids says: "Ha ha ha."
All says: "Lots of Christmas days, four Christmas days, three Christmas days, two Christmas days, and a partridge of returning."
Dewey says: "Gah, nailed it."
Cut to the Moon with the wreckage of the Spear of Selene and Della's inside a pod, looking at her copy of the picture of herself, Donald and Scrooge with the three eggs.
Della says: "Merry Christmas, you guys."
Della says: "See you soon."
Della nearly drops a tear but stops , reapplies her goggles and continues working with a blowtorch on a mysterious object.
