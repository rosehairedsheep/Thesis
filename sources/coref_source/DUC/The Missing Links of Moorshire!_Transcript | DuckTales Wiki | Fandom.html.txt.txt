Story begins with the Moorshire Golf Society Archival Footage filmstrip.
Huey says: "Precision, excellence, men in funny hats."
Huey says: "Welcome to the Duckberg Billionaire's Club Golf Invitation."
Huey says: "The only golf tournament to take place in the world's most exotic and expensive courses."
Huey says: "This year sees Scrooge McDuck facing off against Flintheart Glomgold here at scenic Moorshire: the birthplace of golf."
Huey says: "I'm Huey Duck, attempting to earn my Junior Woodchuck Merit Badge for Sports Commentary."
Huey says: "I'll be here all day providing nuanced announcements..."
Launchpad says: "Are you ready for some golf?"
Huey says: "The badge does require a co-commentator."
Launchpad says: "Two combatants."
Launchpad says: "One hole, no rules."
Huey says: "That's not actually..."
Huey says: "WATCH OUT!"
golfer says: "Ah!"
Scrooge says: "Get excited, kids."
Scrooge says: "Golf is in our blood."
Scrooge says: "Your ancestor, Black Donald McDuck actually invented the sport."
Scrooge says: "Of course he lost so badly that the ensuing temper tantrum caused King James to ban golfing across all of Scotland."
Louie says: "And we're proud of that in some way?"
Dewey says: "I don't know man, go-karts, hitting things really hard with sticks, not being grounded for said hitting, sounds kind of awesome."
Louie says: "It's a sport where you try not to score points to make it end sooner."
Louie says: "Hard pass."
Scrooge says: "Trust me, you'll love it."
Scrooge says: "The quiet strategy, the intense focus, the  semi-permanent hearing loss."
Webby says: "Go Scrooge!"
Webby says: "Boo, Glomgold!"
Webby says: "Yay, custom t-shirts!"
Scrooge says: "I'm glad you're excited, dear, but this sport requires a certain decorum."
Huey says: "Everybody move!"
Launchpad says: "This lake will be used for the swimming portion of the competition."
opening theme says: "Scrooge: Alright Webbigail, care to.."
opening theme says: "what are you doing?"
Webby says: "Oh sorry, I've never been to a sport before."
Scrooge says: "Did you want to give it a go?"
Webby says: "I'm good."
Webby says: "Go club!"
Scrooge says: "Ah, how about you, lad?"
Scrooge says: "Up for a..."
Louie says: "No, gross, no, not even a little."
Dewey says: "Are you guys kidding me?"
Dewey says: "A chance to learn the sport our family invented from the greatest player who ever lived, I assume because I don't follow golf?"
Dewey says: "I want in."
Scrooge says: "Atta boy."
Scrooge says: "Let's hone that..."
Scrooge says: "wildly misplaced enthusiasm, shall we?"
Scrooge says: "We'll start with your swing."
Glomgold says: "Practice all you want, McDuck."
Glomgold says: "You won't be winning this year."
Scrooge says: "You say that every year, Flinty, and every year, you go home crying."
Glomgold says: "My eyes dry out very easily!"
Glomgold says: "But this year, I'll prove that I am the best Scottish Billionaire golfer."
Glomgold says: "I've hired the world's best player to be my caddie."
Tiger says: "Okay, If you want to be a winner, just follow these three rules."
Glomgold says: "I'm already a winner!"
Glomgold says: "Nobody tells Flintheart Glomgold what to do!"
Glomgold says: "You're Fired!"
Glomgold says: "You there, green one."
Glomgold says: "How would you like the honor of caddying under the great Flintheart Glomgold?"
Louie says: "Eh."
Glomgold says: "A chance to bask in the collective glory of victory?"
Louie says: "Blarg..."
Glomgold says: "I'll tip by the hole."
Louie says: "Meh, if I'm going to be bored, I might as well get paid for it."
Glomgold says: "Hah!"
Glomgold says: "Your one nephew's abandoning you."
Glomgold says: "Soon, there will be nobody left to support you."
Webby says: "Sorry!"
Webby says: "Timer went off early."
Huey says: "Here we are, moments away from the classic's opening coin toss."
Huey says: "Glomgold's now very obviously switching the official coin for one that has heads on both sides."
Launchpad says: "Very sneaky."
Huey says: "He tosses the double headed coin, and Glomgold has called tails."
Huey says: "Glomgold clearly embarrassed, now trying to throw the coin into the ocean."
Launchpad says: "He does not make it."
Huey says: "Scrooge, desperate to move things along, has agreed to let Glomgold win the coin toss."
Launchpad says: "Wow, what a game, see you next time, everybody."
Huey says: "It hasn't even, Launchpad?!"
Huey says: "!"
Glomgold says: "That coin toss was only the beginning, Scrooge."
Glomgold says: "The moment of reckoning is at hand."
Scrooge says: "Ugh, it'll take another ten minutes before he takes a shot."
Scrooge says: "Come on lad, let's work on your drive."
Glomgold says: "Hey get back here!"
Glomgold says: "I'll show you how a real golfer would play this hole."
Glomgold says: "Alright boy, how would your uncle play this hole?"
Louie says: "Uh, just, why don't hit the ball in the hole, I guess."
Glomgold says: "Hit the ball..."
Glomgold says: "in the hole..."
Glomgold says: "of course!"
Glomgold says: "I've been overthinking it this entire time."
Glomgold says: "Holy haggis!"
Glomgold says: "It stayed on the course."
Glomgold says: "It went forward, and not on fire!"
Glomgold says: "That might be the best shot I've ever taken."
Glomgold says: "Nice work, caddie."
Scrooge says: "Focus."
Scrooge says: "Filter out all distractions..."
Webby says: "GO SCROOGE!"
Scrooge says: "And remember."
Scrooge says: "Hips back, shoulders down, Tail out, controlled swing..."
Dewey says: "Uf!"
Dewey says: "Was that okay?"
Scrooge says: "Ah, You're a natural."
Scrooge says: "A little unpolished, sure, but if we can focus that swing you'll be almost as good as me one day."
Dewey says: "Really?"
Webby says: "With a teacher like you, he could be even better."
Dewey says: "Really?!"
Dewey says: "!"
Scrooge says: "Oh you know, nearly as good but not quite."
Scrooge says: "After years of hard work and practice, No need getting his hopes up."
Glomgold says: "Scrooge!"
Glomgold says: "Quit stalling!"
Glomgold says: "You're up!"
Huey says: "Scrooge, the returning champion, approaching the first hole."
Launchpad says: "he's probably worried Glomgold will use his one free tackle before the speed round in the third quarter."
Huey says: "What do you think is happening here?"
Launchpad says: "One heck of a game."
Huey says: "Taking his time with the shot..."
Louie says: "Tell me about it JUST HIT THE BALL!"
Scrooge says: "Yah!"
Huey says: "Ouch, and it's deep in the rough."
Glomgold says: "Hah hahah, nice shot, Scroogie."
Glomgold says: "Decide to take a shortcut through the weeds?"
Glomgold says: "Unless..."
Glomgold says: "Boy!"
Glomgold says: "Why didn't you tell me about the shortcut through the weeds?"
Scrooge says: "Ach, I can't believe it I haven't had a shot that bad in forty years."
Scrooge says: "What in the blazes..."
Huey says: "AAHH!!"
Launchpad says: "AAHH!!"
Launchpad says: "Ah yes, Scrooge went for the classic magic forest stones bonus."
Launchpad says: "Risky, but it paid off."
Glomgold says: "Ooh it wasn't a shortcut."
Glomgold says: "The great McDuck finally hit a right clunker."
Scrooge says: "I did not."
Scrooge says: "I was simply getting a lay of the terrain."
Scrooge says: "See the key to a good golf game..."
Glomgold says: "Take the penalty and let's get back to the course."
Scrooge says: "A Scotsman plays it where it lands."
Webby says: "Um, Mr."
Webby says: "McDuck?"
Scrooge says: "Heavenly hollyhock."
Webby says: "Mythical glowing stones, mysterious teleportation circles,  Do you know what this means?"
Louie says: "No more golf!"
Louie says: "Woo hoo!"
Huey says: "Does anybody see any clues about where we are?"
Webby says: "There are these two orbs."
Louie says: "Hm, interesting."
Dewey says: "And it looks like they fit in that hole over there."
Louie says: "Oh, okay..."
Glomgold says: "AH!"
Glomgold says: "Can't toss the blasted things."
Glomgold says: "Yah!"
Glomgold says: "UH!"
Scrooge says: "Maybe we can use these clubs."
Louie says: "Oh no!"
Louie says: "Oh no nononononono!"
Louie says: "Guys, it's golf."
Louie says: "It's still golf!"
Louie says: "Okay, that's it!"
Louie says: "I'm going home!"
Louie says: "Where did home go?"
Huey says: "Welcome back to the Billionaire's Club Classic, where in a bizarre turn of events, the players have become trapped in some sort of mystical fairy realm, but they remain undeterred."
Launchpad says: "For more, we go to two tiny horses."
Huey says: "What are you..."
Huey says: "AH!"
Briar says: "Greetings."
Briar says: "We're Briar and Bramble, the keepers of this realm."
Webby says: "Talking animals wearing clothes?"
Dewey says: "Oh no, did we die?"
Dewey says: "Are we in Webby Heaven?"
Bramble says: "Bet You're wondering what this place is."
Louie says: "It's a mystical golf course, right?"
Huey says: "Did ancient Scottish druids build a secret course so they can keep playing golf even after Black Donald got it banned?"
Briar says: "Uh yep that's all correct."
Bramble says: "Here, hop on our backs."
Bramble says: "We'll give you a tour."
Webby says: "Ooooh,  You're kelpies, aren't you?"
Webby says: "You tempt people on your backs and carry them off into the sea."
Bramble says: "Oh, nononono, we just got out of the shower, that's all."
Bramble says: "Fine, that is generally our plan."
Briar says: "C'mon Bramble, if they're SO smart, they must know all about the treasure at the end of the course."
Scrooge says: "Treasure?"
Glomgold says: "Treasure?"
Briar says: "First to complete this course, will win the priceless druid's cup."
Bramble says: "That's proving them to be the finest golfer in every plane of reality."
Glomgold says: "Ohhh."
Louie says: "Uh huh, okay well anyone else think we should ignore the murder ponies and go home?"
Briar says: "You'll all be sent home safely as soon as you finish the course."
Bramble says: "That is, IF you finish the course."
Bramble says: "Uh, um, did we mention the trophy has custom engraving?"
Bramble says: "Ooooohh."
Dewey says: "Dewey, you've found your calling."
Scrooge says: "Easy lad, You just can't flail that thing at random anymore."
Scrooge says: "There's too much at stake."
Scrooge says: "If we lose the ball, we don't go home."
Scrooge says: "We have got to play it smart."
Briar says: "You might want to get started."
Briar says: "it can be awful hard to play once those mists roll in."
Dewey says: "C'mon, we're wasting time."
Glomgold says: "Caddie!"
Glomgold says: "My clubs!"
Glomgold says: "Caddie?"
Louie says: "A-ahem!"
Bramble says: "Hop on our backs."
Bramble says: "We'll take you to the next hole, and definitely not to a watery grave."
Briar says: "You are the least fun victims ever."
Glomgold says: "What the!"
Launchpad says: "Oh, should have seen that coming."
Huey says: "How?"
Huey says: "How could he have possibly see that coming?"
Glomgold says: "Give it back, you overgrown puddle."
Glomgold says: "Ah!"
Glomgold says: "Caddie!"
Glomgold says: "Help!"
Glomgold says: "Ah, Uhgh, Here!"
Louie says: "Ugh, it's like you don't even want to be rescued."
Glomgold says: "AHH!"
Scrooge says: "Old golf tip: let Flinty spring that trap."
Scrooge says: "The rest is just patience."
Scrooge says: "Patience, patience, patience!"
Dewey says: "Ah!"
Dewey says: "if you just let me..."
Scrooge says: "Not the time for a reckless club."
Scrooge says: "Agh C'mon you blasted tentacle!"
Scrooge says: "And besides, you cannot just sub in."
Scrooge says: "It's against the rules of golf."
Briar says: "It's okay."
Briar says: "Druid golf allows for two subs."
Bramble says: "Water's great, by the way."
Scrooge says: "Oh, give it a go, but don't get too discouraged if you don't make it."
Glomgold says: "Ah!"
Webby says: "Go, Dewey!"
Scrooge says: "Good shot lad, very proud of you."
Webby says: "You don't sound proud."
Dewey says: "Yeah, Scrooge and Dewey, taking on the world one hole at a time."
Huey says: "There you have it, another brash young upstart destined to surpass his aging mentor."
Scrooge says: "Is the commentary still necessary?"
Huey says: "It helps me feel in control during a frankly insane situation."
Launchpad says: "I like talking this way because it makes everything sound important."
Launchpad says: "Baloney, trampoline."
Montage of Dewey making spectacular trick shots while Scrooge and Glomgold struggle to keep up.
Dewey says: "Nailed it!"
Webby says: "Woo hoo!"
Huey says: "Scrooge still in the lead on the seventeenth hole, but Glomgold is closing in."
Launchpad says: "Hey, so is that weird mist."
Webby says: "Nice job."
Webby says: "Nice job, and nice job."
Dewey says: "Not nice enough."
Dewey says: "Glomgold's going to pass us."
Glomgold says: "You bet your ballast I am!"
Glomgold says: "I'll prove once and for all I'm the best golfer in this or any other..."
Glomgold says: "AHH CADDIE!"
Dewey says: "I'm pretty sure I can get it to the hole with one swing."
Dewey says: "Let me go."
Scrooge says: "And risk dumping it down into the water?"
Scrooge says: "Absolutely not."
Briar says: "Aw, give him a chance."
Briar says: "If he hits it in the water, he can jump on the kelpies to get it."
Briar says: "I'm a small girl duck."
Briar says: "You can trust me."
Bramble says: "Oh uh..."
Dewey says: "C'mon, I can do this."
Scrooge says: "Do what?"
Scrooge says: "Whack the ball blindly?"
Dewey says: "Into the hole, yes."
Dewey says: "Like I've been doing all day."
Dewey says: "Why don't you trust me to make this?"
Scrooge says: "You don't have the experience."
Scrooge says: "It takes time, effort,  wait!"
Dewey says: "Ah haha, It's so easy."
Huey says: "No!"
Scrooge says: "Grr..."
Dewey says: "I'm sorry, I just knew I could, so I..."
Scrooge says: "You pull a club out of a Scotsman's hand, you'd best be prepared to knock him out with it."
Dewey says: "Hey, I made the shot."
Scrooge says: "You disobeyed me, and risked the entire game with your showboating."
Dewey says: "I'm showboating?"
Dewey says: "This whole thing has been about how great you are."
Dewey says: "You're so worried that someone might actually be better than you at something that you keep..."
Scrooge says: "See here."
Scrooge says: "I am an interdimentially ranked golfer."
Dewey says: "Whatever."
Dewey says: "I'm over this dumb sport anyway."
Dewey says: "Finish the course so we can go home."
Scrooge says: "Now hold on."
Scrooge says: "I didn't mean to..."
Glomgold says: "Out of the way, McDuck."
Huey says: "The last hole."
Scrooge says: "Looks like some sort of hall of fame."
Scrooge says: "Well, your old Uncle Scrooge will be joining it soon enough, eh..."
Dewey says: "Let's get this over with."
Huey says: "Scrooge lining up, and none too soon."
Huey says: "Morale is not high."
Webby says: "Uh, Mr."
Webby says: "McDuck?"
Webby says: "Those mists are getting really close."
Scrooge says: "Well that's ominous."
Huey says: "And he hooks it onto the wall."
Dewey says: "Nice work."
Dewey says: "How are you going to get up there?"
Glomgold says: "It's happening."
Glomgold says: "I'm one drive away from claiming the trophy and beating Scrooge McDuck!"
Glomgold says: "As soon as I take this swing, I, Flintheart Glomgold, will be the winner of the Billionaire's Club Classic."
Glomgold says: "Sure, you may have won the previous twenty-seven, but I think we can all agree that this one counts more than the rest combined."
Scrooge says: "Uh, Flinty?"
Glomgold says: "Stop it Scrooge, I'm savoring the moment."
Glomgold says: "Caddie, savor it with me."
Glomgold says: "Caddie?"
Glomgold says: "Ugh."
Louie says: "Um..."
Glomgold says: "Oh, I see."
Glomgold says: "Curse you McDuck!"
Glomgold says: "Curse you and my love of moment savoring!"
Louie says: "AHH!"
Scrooge says: "The mist turns people to stone."
Scrooge says: "Those statues used to be real golfers."
Briar says: "Oh by the way, the mists of Moorshire they turn mortals to stone."
Briar says: "Those statues are, You just said all that, didn't you?"
Bramble says: "So you're doomed."
Bramble says: "Better to let us drown you instead."
Bramble says: "Let's go."
All says: "No!"
Briar says: "You people are no fun."
Scrooge says: "We have to finish the course."
Scrooge says: "Those hoofed hostiles said it would get us home."
Webby says: "Everybody, we need to support Scrooge."
Dewey says: "Why?"
Dewey says: "He hasn't supported me all day."
Webby says: "No, we need to "support" Scrooge."
Webby says: "Not everything is a life lesson."
Scrooge says: "Louie, hand me the club."
Louie says: "Nope, right, sure, not the time."
Scrooge says: "Oh my..."
Huey says: "Scrooge taking his time."
Huey says: "I'm not sure why."
Huey says: "There are lives at stake."
Launchpad says: "Wait, whose?"
Launchpad says: "Oh, right."
Launchpad says: "uh!"
Huey says: "This has been Huey Duck, signing off!"
Louie says: "Man, I hate this sport."
Webby says: "C'mon Scrooge, I know you can do it."
Dewey says: "Webby!"
Dewey says: "Guys!"
Dewey says: "No!"
Dewey says: "What are you waiting for?"
Dewey says: "Take the stupid shot!"
Scrooge says: "Not me."
Dewey says: "What?"
Scrooge says: "I cannot make the shot."
Scrooge says: "You can."
Scrooge says: "I know you can do it."
Dewey says: "Okay okay, filter out all distractions."
Dewey says: "Hips back, shoulders down, tail tucked, AHH!"
Dewey says: "Whack the ball!"
Dewey says: "Whack the ball!"
Ball bonces around and hits the cup.
Dewey says: "Yes!"
All says: "Oof."
Scrooge says: "You did it, lad!"
Scrooge says: "I knew you could."
Briar says: "Congratulations, champions."
Bramble says: "You are the first players to ever complete the druid's cup."
Scrooge says: "Go on."
Scrooge says: "You earned it."
Dewey says: ""Scroge and Douise"?"
Briar says: "Sorry, it was a rush job."
Bramble says: "We really didn't expect you to make it."
Briar says: "Now, who's up for a victory swim?"
All says: "No!"
Glomgold says: "You!"
Glomgold says: "you let me turn to stone!"
Glomgold says: "You're the worst cabbie ever."
Glomgold says: "You're fired!"
Glomgold says: "As soon as you help me out."
Glomgold says: "ugh!"
Glomgold says: "Augh!"
Scrooge says: "You know we could use another player for next year's invitational."
Scrooge says: "I'd love someone who'd actually give me a run for my money."
Dewey says: "Eh, I think my pro career is over."
Dewey says: "Going out on top."
Dewey says: "Still, I'd be up for a friendly round now and then."
Scrooge says: "Sounds grand."
Webby says: "Woo, Screwey for life!"
Webby says: "In your face, everybody who's not them!"
Webby says: "Woo hoo!"
Scrooge says: "Maybe just the two of us."
Launchpad says: "Well there you have it folks, Scrooge let go of his ego, and learned that a good teacher's pride should be in his student, not himself."
Huey says: "That's..."
Huey says: "actually a good insight."
Huey says: "Wow, I'm impressed, Launchpad, and you're choking on golf balls."
Launchpad says: "They look like tasty eggs, I've resisted for so long."
