Louie says: "Just grab it, already!"
Scrooge says: "The Idol of Sybil is not a trinket to be unceremoniously swindled."
Louie says: "But- but- but- but- but- Can we just wrap up the "woah," and get to the "wait, what," already?"
Louie says: "Woah, some cool hidden city or treasure or whatever."
Louie says: "Wait, what?"

Louie says: "Can we please move it along?"

Scrooge says: "I'll be in the study."
Beakley says: "I'll be right here, cleaning up after your last adventure."
Louie says: "Cool, I'm just going to lie here forever."
Scrooge says: "Kids!"
Scrooge says: "Kids, I found a hidden compartment in the idol."

Huey says: "Following in the family tradition of adventure."

Huey says: "I'm the brains."
Huey says: "Webby's the fist."
Huey says: "Dewey's the devil-may-care guts."
Huey says: "You..."
Huey says: "are there too."
Huey says: "Plus, it's earned me the rank of Senior Junior Woodchuck."
Huey says: "Two stripes!"
Huey says: "Look, I'm sure you'll get time off after we find this treasure, unless this treasure is cursed, and dispelling the curse leads to a whole other adventure, and so on, forever."
Huey says: "Let's go!"
Louie says: "Fine."
Louie says: "Hey, maybe when we get back you can earn that sewing badge."
Huey says: "Please, I earned my sewing badge ages ago."
Louie says: "Then how did this stripe come loose?"
Huey says: "That's impossible."
Louie says: "Must be more tired than you realize."
Louie says: "You're slipping."
Scrooge says: "I never would have used a slip stitch."
Scrooge says: "That is amateur hour."
Scrooge says: "All this constant adventuring must have torn it apart."
Louie says: "Uncle Scrooge!"
Louie says: "All this constant adventuring is tearing us apart!"
Scrooge says: "Nonsense, we're closer than ever."
Scrooge says: "Eh, kids."
Dewey says: "Teamwork makes the dream work."
Webby says: "Teamwork makes the dream work."
Louie says: "This needs to stop!"
Scrooge says: "I've tried, but they really do enjoy harmonizing."
Louie says: "With all the nonstop danger we never get any quality time."
Louie says: "Do we even really know each other?"
Louie says: "I mean, is this Huey, or Dewey?"
Louie says: "I don't know, which one has the hat?"
Scrooge says: "There's no better bonding experience than a high-stakes, death-defying, adventure."
Louie says: "What about a quiet movie night in?"
Louie says: "Oh, or make your own pizza night?"
Louie says: "Ooh, how about game night?"
Scrooge says: "Game night?"
Scrooge says: "GAME NIGHT!"
Duckworth says: "Oh no."
Beakley says: "Oh no."
Louie says: "Ready for a relaxing night in?"
Beakley says: "You know how competitive he gets when he's trying to best an enemy?"
Beakley says: "On game night, we are the enemies."
Scrooge says: "Partner up, everyone."
Scrooge says: "If we lose, you're out of the will."
Donald says: "I was in the will?"
Dewey says: "I got Dewey/Webby!"
Webby says: "I got Dewey/Webby!"
Dewey says: "We're the perfect team in the field."
Dewey says: "Game night will be a snap."
Duckworth says: "Oh, uh, I sense that a dark magic's afoot in the ethereal plane."
Duckworth says: "I must go."
Beakley says: "No!"
Beakley says: "You blasted phantasm!"
Beakley says: "You will not leave me to deal with this!"
Duckworth says: "Spooky things."
Duckworth says: "Farewell."
Launchpad says: "Oh, c'mon."
Launchpad says: "Don't worry, Mrs."
Launchpad says: "B."
Launchpad says: "I'll be your game partner."
Beakley says: "Fine."
Beakley says: "At least we'll lose quickly."
Louie says: "I guess that leaves us, Hu- You have a whole other thing going on."
Huey says: "You were right, man."
Huey says: "We've got to stay in."
Huey says: "Recenter."
Huey says: "Sewing."
Huey says: "Totally basic skill, okay?"
Huey says: "Hah."
Huey says: "YAH!"
Gyro says: "Adventure!"
Louie says: "No, no.."
Gyro says: "Oh yes, green duck."
Gyro says: "Behold."
Gyro says: "The Gearloose micro-phone."
Gyro says: "Capable of amplifying sub-decibelic feedback."
Gyro says: "It makes tiny sounds loud."
Louie says: "Go away!"
Louie says: "We don't want any!"
Gyro says: "I believe there's a microscopic civilization of wandering nomads invisible to the naked eye living right here in your home!"
Gyro says: "Listen to the sweet call of adventure."
Louie says: "Nope!"
Louie says: "Hard pass!"
Louie slams the door repeatably on Gyro until the door is fully closed.
Gyro says: "I also added a shrink ray feature."
Gyro says: "We could shrink down, make first contact with the species whom I have named Gyropuddlians, and conquer, I mean, explore this tiny frontier."
Gyro says: "An entire universe right under your family's feet."
Louie says: "We'd never get a break."
Louie says: "Even when we were home, we would just keep on..."
Louie says: "adventuring."
Gyro says: "Exactly!"
Gyro says: "Now, where is your uncle?"
Gyro says: "Wait."
Huey says: "What did you do?"
Huey says: "You shrunk him!"
Louie says: "Which is exactly what he wanted."
Huey says: "What?"
Louie says: "Everything will be fine."
Louie says: "Woah, Gyro shrunk down and worshiped as a god-king."
Louie says: "Wait, what?"
Louie says: "They're in a war with a bunch of giant ants?"
Louie says: "AAAHH!"
Louie says: "He almost got eaten by a spider but survives and teaches everybody a lesson in trust or something!"
Huey says: "That did happen twice last month."
Gyro says: "Primitive nomads, I give you the gift of superior intellect."
Gyropuddlians says: "ARRGHH!"
Gyro says: "Uh, and this penlight."
Gyropuddlians says: "Ooh!"
Gyropuddlians says: "Gyro!"
Gyropuddlians says: "Gyro!"
Gyropuddlians says: "Gyro!"
Louie says: "See?"
Louie says: "Everything's fine."
Louie says: "Come on, let Gyro have his own adventure while we take it easy for once, and we can have a quiet, rejuvenating night in."
Louie says: "Bone up on your skills."
Louie says: "And we can't tell anybody because if you do tell anybody, things will only get worse, until you'll never be able to sew a merit badge onto a sash ever again, okay?!"
Louie says: "!"
Scrooge says: "The crab man of Crustacea!"
Scrooge says: "Ha ha!"
Scrooge says: "Nambian night sprites!"
Scrooge says: "The Seren-yeti!"
Dewey says: "Oh, that's why he picked Donald."
Webby says: "You spend thirty years guessing what Donald is saying, you must get good at nonverbal communication."
Beakley says: "Time!"
Donald says: "I was a mamanticore!"
Scrooge says: "That was a mamanticore?"
Scrooge says: "This is a mamanticore!"
Scrooge says: "Uh-uh."
Beakley says: "Mr."
Beakley says: "McDuck and Donald scored thirty-four."
Scrooge says: "Grr.."
Scrooge says: "Nope, this is a mamanticore, uh-uh."
Beakley says: "Next up, Webby and Dewey."
Webby says: "Those two can barely stand each other."
Webby says: "Imagine what a perfectly in-sync team like us can do?"
Beakley says: "And..."
Beakley says: "Go!"
Webby says: "Oh, this is easy."
Dewey says: "Sour!"
Dewey says: "Sour grapes!"
Dewey says: "Old prune!"
Dewey says: "Hat!"
Dewey says: "Fruit hat!"
Dewey says: "It was a fruit hat!"
Dewey says: "Bowler full of smoothies!"
Dewey says: "Nailed it?!"
Dewey says: "!"
Dewey says: "Money!"
Dewey says: "Expensive smoothies!"
Dewey says: "Smoothies with cash in them!"
Dewey says: "Swim away from the smoothies!"
Dewey says: "An old man!"
Dewey says: "Prune smoothies!"
Dewey says: "No?"
Beakley says: "Time!"
Webby says: "Ah!"
Webby says: "It was Scrooge McDuck!"
Dewey says: "But Uncle Scrooge doesn't like smoothies."
Webby says: "Ah, just a slight hiccup."
Webby says: "Right?"
Beakley says: "Huey?"
Huey says: "Nothing is weird."
Huey says: "Did you say something?"
Huey says: "I'm not saying anything."
Louie says: "Because this is charades and those are the rules."
Louie says: "Very good, Huey."
Louie says: "Ready, and..."
Gyro says: "Go my minions!"
Gyro says: "Do the bidding of your god-king."
Scrooge says: "What was that?"
Louie says: "Yep, great guess, Huey."
Louie says: ""Do the bidding of your god-king."
Louie says: "" Says it right there."
Louie says: "What are we playing next?"
Louie says: "I don't know!"
Louie says: "I'll go get some snacks!"
Louie says: "I thought you were having the adventure of a lifetime, by yourself."
Gyro says: "I was!"
Gyro says: "Unfortunately, my people have declared war on the evil giants."
Gyro says: "That's you."
Huey says: "Wait, what?"
Gyro says: "Apparently, you've accidentally destroyed every tiny town they've ever built."
Gyro says: "Laundry Basket City."
Gyro says: "Top-hatisail."
Gyro says: "The Floating Island of Toilet-opolis."
Louie says: "Ewww."
Gyro says: "I thought I could shrink you down."
Louie says: "Nope, this is our night off."
Louie says: "You can handle this mess on your own."
Gyro says: "Of course I can, for I am Gyro the Mighty."
Gyro says: "Gyro the Unconquerable, AH!"
Gyro says: "Giant ants!"
Gyro says: "Shrink them!"
Gyro says: "Shrink them!"
Huey says: "AAAHH!!"
Louie says: "AAAHH!!"
Huey says: "Oh, come on!"
Launchpad says: "Hey guys, got any guacamole?"
Launchpad says: "Maybe some humus?"
Louie says: "Launchpad!"
Louie says: "Are you okay?"
Launchpad says: "Yep."
Launchpad says: "Wait, I seem to be stuck in a giant world of nightmare horrors."
Launchpad says: "Hey, there's Gyro and a bunch of guys."
Launchpad says: "Ooh, a giant spider."
Huey says: "Louie, I know this is our night off, but we got to do something."
Louie says: "Why?"
Louie says: "Gyro's a genius, and Launchpad has crashed so many times I'm convinced he may be immortal."
Huey says: "We've been on dozens of adventures."
Huey says: "Why are these recent ones any different?"
Louie says: "Look I just- We need a break, alright?"
Huey says: "Well, I'm telling Uncle Scrooge."
Louie says: "Huey!"
Huey says: "Louie!"
Beakley says: "Boys?"
Beakley says: "Have you seen Launchpad?"
Louie says: "He left for non-suspicious reasons."
Beakley says: "Oh no, without my partner I can't play."
Beakley says: "Curse my luck."
Beakley says: "Just curse it."
Beakley says: "Good night."
Louie says: "One calm night, and I promise we'll set everything straight."
Huey says: "Hmmm."
Donald says: "Careful, careful, careful!"
Scrooge says: "Will you pipe down?"
Scrooge says: "I reassembled the Arden of Pharaoh Top-mouse the Third."
Donald says: "Now!"
Donald says: "Do it Now!"
Scrooge says: "Ha ha!"
Donald says: "Ha ha!"
Scrooge says: "Team Uncle for the win!"
Donald says: "Team Uncle for the win!"
Dewey says: "Hey guys."
Dewey says: "Just in time to watch us totally embarrass the olds."
Dewey says: "You got this?"
Webby says: "Does a bumberdinger have wings?"
Webby says: "It does."
Dewey says: "I knew that."
Dewey says: "I knew that."
Dewey says: "Totally in sync."
Dewey says: "Break."
Webby says: "I'll tap the block, you pull it from the other side."
Dewey says: "You're tapping two blocks."
Webby says: "No I'm not."
Dewey says: "Well it's not moving by itself."
Louie says: "Launchpad, where are you?"
Launchpad says: "Well, in honor of our victory over the spider, Gyro demanded an offering."
Launchpad says: "So, we're trying to conquer the Tower of Infinity in the TV room."
Louie says: "Tower of Infinity?"
Louie says: "What?"
Huey says: "Launchpad, stop them."
Huey says: "If both blocks come out, the tower will collapse."
Huey says: "You'll be..."
Operator says: "The number you have reached has been disconnected."
Louie says: "No nonononono!"
Huey says: "No nonononono!"
Louie says: "Careful, you'll crush them!"
Huey says: "They're already crushed!"
Huey says: "Why?"
Huey says: "WHY?!!!!"
Huey says: "!!!!"
Webby says: "Guys, relax."
Webby says: "It's just a game."
Dewey says: "Yeah, a game you lost for us."
Webby says: "What?"
Dewey says: "Nothing."
Launchpad says: "Uh, hello?"
Louie says: "Yes!"
Huey says: "Yes!"
Louie says: "It's nice to talk to your friends on the phone."
Louie says: "It's so much more personal than texting."
Scrooge says: "Okay, Next game."
Huey says: "Launchpad, how are you okay?"
Launchpad says: "The good news is, the Gyropuddlians are fast."
Launchpad says: "The bad news is, they thought the tower was a trap and now they decided to use Gyro's doohickey to declare war on us all."
Gyro says: "Unhand me, intellectual inferiors!"
Launchpad says: "Now Gyro, you catch more flies with honey than vinegar."
Launchpad says: "Ah!"
Launchpad says: "GIANT FLIES!"
Launchpad says: "Ahh!!"
Gyro says: "They caught and trained them!"
Huey says: "What are we going to do, Louie?"
Louie says: "Just a fun night in."
Louie says: "No stress."
Louie says: "Wonderful memories."
Huey says: "Hey, what is up with you?"
Louie says: "Nothing, I'm just lovably lazy."
Huey says: "No, seriously."
Huey says: "Why have you been so down on adventuring lately?"
Louie says: "Because I'm not good at it, okay?"
Louie says: "You guys all have your things."
Louie says: "Mom was great at adventuring and she still got hurt."
Louie says: "I'm only good at talking my way out of it."
Louie says: "How long before that's not enough?"
Huey says: "Are you really going to let our family get hurt because you're afraid to get hurt?"
Louie says: "Wait, where's the micro-phone?"
Scrooge says: "Behold, the final challenge."
Scrooge says: "Scroogeopoly: the thrilling game of finance and property acquisition."
Dewey says: "The final challenge feels extremely rigged."
Dewey says: "Your face is literally on the box."
Scrooge says: "Nonsense."
Scrooge says: "Now, which piece will your team play as?"
Webby says: "Yeah, maybe we'll play on our own."
Webby says: "I'll be the top hat."
Dewey says: "I'll be the other top hat."
Scrooge says: "And I will be the top hat."
Scrooge says: "Oldest player goes first."
Louie says: "Hurry!"
Louie says: "They're going to shrink everybody."
Scrooge says: "I'll buy Dawson, put bins in Howduyustan, and collect rent dividends on all the rest."
Scrooge says: "And Donald lands in jail."
Donald says: "Again?"
Scrooge says: "And that will be taxes and fees for each property you own."
Scrooge says: "Heh, and I thought you were easy to beat as a team."
Donald says: "Huh?"
Scrooge says: "Isn't anybody worthy to put up a fight?"
Webby says: "Ah!"
Dewey says: "Uh!"
Launchpad says: "Hi, Dewey."
Dewey says: "Is this part of the game?"
Gyro says: "Careful!"
Gyro says: "They don't trust outsiders for some reason."
Huey says: "Quick!"
Huey says: "Unshrink them."
Huey says: "Ah!"
Huey says: "not him!"
Louie says: "We can't just blast wildly."
Louie says: "We need a plan."
Louie says: "What do I do?"
Louie says: "What do I do?"
Louie says: "What do I do?"
Louie says: "What do "I" do?"
Louie says: "That's what I do!"
Louie says: "Everybody listen!"
All says: "Louie?"
Launchpad says: "Hey, Louie!"
Louie says: "Launchpad, crash you way out of there to break them up."
Launchpad says: "Okay, but what do I crash with?"
Launchpad says: "I don't see anything crash-able."
Gyro says: "Ow!"
Gyro says: "Ow!"
Gyro says: "Owie!"
Louie says: "Scrooge and Donald!"
Louie says: "Coral the Gyropuddlians onto Barks Place."
Scrooge says: "C'mon, you minuscule hooligans!"
Louie says: "Huey, show him what a Senior Junior Woodchuck can do."
Huey says: "Seed!"
Huey says: "Stitching line!"
Huey says: "Yoke!"
Huey says: "Basting stitch!"
Louie says: "Dewey, Webby, get up to those flies."
Dewey says: "Shouldn't Scrooge and Donald do it?"
Scrooge says: "Kind of busy now, kids."
Webby says: "But you guys are totally in sync."
Scrooge says: "Are you daft?"
Scrooge says: "I'm a billionaire and he's a moocher that lives in that pool, and eats my food."
Donald says: "Hey!"
Webby says: "We lost every game."
Webby says: "We argue and we have nothing in common."
Dewey says: "Outside of adventure, how are we even friends?"
Scrooge says: "Of course you're not friends."
Scrooge says: "You drive each other crazier than anyone could and still care about each other more than anyone."
Scrooge says: "You're not friends; you're family."
Scrooge says: "NOW MOVE!"
Webby says: "Together!"
Webby says: "Teamwork makes the dream work."
Dewey says: "Teamwork makes the dream work."
Louie says: "Almost, almost, Now!"
Scrooge says: "So, I believe it was my turn?"
The next day says: "Louie:  I have thirteen different apologies depending on how mad you are."
Scrooge says: "Close the door."
Louie says: "Oh, you're that mad."
Scrooge says: "You saw the angles didn't you?"
Scrooge says: "You saw the pieces on the board, devised a plan, delegated, and executed perfectly."
Scrooge says: "You even offered the wee warriors a permanent home."
Scrooge says: "Do you know how I made my fortune?"
Louie says: "Yes, by being tougher than the toughies, and smarter than the smarties."
Scrooge says: "And, sharper than the sharpies."
Scrooge says: "People don't know about that one."
Scrooge says: "The ability to read a situation and see all the shortcuts and the possibilities."
Scrooge says: "Your mother could do it."
Scrooge says: "So can you."
Louie says: "I can?"
Scrooge says: "I should have seen it."
Scrooge says: "The way you were picking apart those adventures earlier: the "woah," the "wait, what," the "ahh."
Scrooge says: "" If you apply that gift, you might be a bigger billionaire than I am one day."
Scrooge says: "Here, it's not a number-one dime, but it's a start."
Louie says: "Woah."
Louie starts up a business called "Louie Inc.".
Huey says: "Wait, What?"
Dewey says: "Wait, What?"
Webby says: "Wait, What?"
