Huey says: "Twenty points!"
Dewey says: "Yeah, I mean whoops."
Dewey says: "I'm sorry Lena."
Lena says: "Oh, it's fine."
Louie says: "Minus five points, because Lena's a good guy now."
Boys says: "Yeah!"
Boys says: "Woo hoo!"
Webby says: "Minus a million because she's the best guy now."
Lena says: "Thanks for helping me set this up."
Webby says: "Of course."
Webby says: "We got everything needed for a sleepover."
Webby says: "Sleeping bags, board games, snacks."
Violet says: "Self defense weapons, all manner of booby trap."
Webby says: "And a bodyguard at the door."
Webby says: "Nothing weird is going to happen at this slumber party."
Lena says: "Yep, just a totally normal friend-aversery celebration."
Lena says: "Webby, we met one year ago today, I think."
Lena says: "Time loses all meaning in the infinite night of the shadow realm."
Oh, happy freind-aversery,.
If I didn't have you, it'd be worse for me.
I'm made of shadow, you're made of flesh,.
Whoever thought that we would mesh.
Webby says: "You are a wordsmith."
Webby says: "Aw, you can't be tired yet."
Lena says: "Sorry, I just stayed up all night making friendship bracelets."
Lena says: "Heh heh."
Louie says: "Is this a prank or something?"
Louie says: "Why are you being so nice?"
Lena says: "Pfft, can't I do something nice for my friends."
Lena says: "Not everything I say is sarcastic and mean."
Huey says: "You literally sound like that now."
Lena says: "That's just my voice."
Lena says: "I can't help it."
Webby says: "Aahh!"
Violet says: "I found it's clearer to convey no emotion whatsoever."
Lena says: "Listen, I'm new to this whole good guy thing, and I just want to get it right."
Webby says: "Lena, you're the living shadow of Magica De Spell, Scrooge's greatest enemy, and you still turned out good."
Webby says: "That makes you extra super good, right?"
Dewey says: "Math checks out."
Webby says: "You don't have to prove anything to us."
Webby says: "Om nom, this is gonna be the best party ever!"
All says: "Yeah!"
Huey says: "Let's eat pure sugar!"
opening theme says: "Louie:  Boy, this sure has been a friend-aversery thingie."
opening theme says: "You know who my best friend is?"
Dewey says: "Me?"
Louie says: "Sleep."
Louie says: "C'mon even Beakley fell asleep, I think?"
Webby says: "It's a spy thing."
Webby says: "And yeah, it might be sleepy time."
Lena says: "Sleep?"
Lena says: "No, no, no way, it's only 4 am."
Lena says: "That's so early."
Violet says: "Judging from your sunken eyes, elevated heart rate and irritability."
Lena says: "Your irritability."
Violet says: "I'd say you're suffering from a serious lack of sleep."
Lena says: "Uh huh yeah, because I've been planning so many exciting activities for this party."
Lena says: "I'll be surprised if we ever sleep again."
Lena says: "I'm gonna go splash some cold water in my face."
Lena says: "We can party even harder, heh heh."
All says: "Yay."
Lena says: "It's fine."
Lena says: "Everything's fine."
Lena says: "Like Webby said, I don't have to prove anything."
Lena says: "I'm a good guy now."
Lena says: "Bad dreams can't hurt you."
Lena sprouts a tuft of black hair and evil looking eyes.
Webby says: "Lena, do you need um, you-know-what paper?"
Webby says: "Lena?"
Lena says: "No, I'm fine."
Lena says: "Just being normal."
Lena says: "Heh heh heh heh heh."
Lena says: "So, what did everyone decide on for our next party game?"
Webby says: "Sometimes slumber parties are about getting an extra good sleep because you're surrounded by friends."
Webby says: "It's okay."
Webby says: "I know your secret."
Lena says: "You do?"
Webby says: "I used to be scared of the dark too, but I've got glowy stars on the ceiling."
Lena stares at the stars and drifts asleep. Magic emanates from her. The party ends up on an island.
Violet says: "I'm sorry, where are we?"
Webby says: "Heh, that's weird."
Louie says: "Okay, I'm calling Uncle Scrooge."
Louie says: "Uh, it's a, ugh."
Louie says: "Why can't I remember?"
Dewey says: "Why are you dialing a banana?"
Louie says: "What?"
Unicorn says: "You are the chosen one, Webbigail."
Unicorn says: "Are you ready to enter my extremely extreme obstacle course?"
Webby says: "Oh, it's happening."
Webby says: "Yeah."
Louie says: "No!"
Louie says: "How do we get off this island?"
Unicorn says: "Oh that's easy."
Unicorn says: "Go past the acid rainbow waterfall, take a left at the glitter quicksand pit, and then stroll through poison flower field."
Webby says: "This is like all my wildest dreams smushed together."
Lena says: "Dreams?"
Lena says: "No, no no, maybe Scrooge is testing us."
Lena says: "Maybe the plane is crashed nearby."
Violet says: "Or we're in a lucid shared dream state manifested by your magic."
Violet says: "Oh, like her thing made any more sense?"
Violet says: "Observe."
Violet says: "Extreme sleep deprivation could upset your magical aura."
Violet says: "Have you been having bad dreams?"
Lena says: "Uh, yeah."
Lena says: "All week."
Lena says: "I thought a slumber party would help me stay up, not pull you into my freaky shadow problems again."
Webby says: "Lena, we all know you're magic and that's great."
Webby says: "We want to be in on your freaky problems."
Webby says: "No more secrets, okay?"
Lena says: "Okay."
Lena says: "No more secrets."
Lena says: "I'll get us out of here."
Lena says: "Wake up."
Huey says: "It's bad enough waking a sleep walker."
Huey says: "Who knows what waking a dream walker could do?"
Violet says: "I concur."
Violet says: "It's best if we stay in the dream until Lena wakes naturally."
Webby says: "A party in a dream?"
Webby says: "Best friend-aversery ever!"
Webby says: "Let's fly because we can!"
Louie says: "I hate walking!"
All says: "Woo hoo!"
Webby says: "Lena!"
Webby says: "You coming?"
Lena says: "Uh, I'll just follow you on foot."
Louie says: "Up up in the sky, it's me."
Huey says: "Ugh!"
Dewey says: "Ugh!"
Lena says: "This is good."
Lena says: "Everyone is having fun."
Lena says: "I probably grew horrible bat monster wings because of very non-evil reasons."
Lena says: "Ah ah!"
Lena says: "Oof!"
All says: "Ha ha ha."
Louie says: "Ew, Webby."
Louie says: "Why is there a school in your dream?"
Dewey says: "That's not Webby's dream."
Webby says: "Woah, nice hair."
Dewey says: "Thanks."
Dewey says: "It's alive."
Webby says: "Ah!"
Dewey says: "This is Dewey High."
I'm the most wholesome boy in school,.
I'm a talented jock everyone thinks is cool,.
If TV and movies taught me anything,.
When you turn into a teen you just have to sing.
Lena says: "Oops."
Dewey says: "That's okay."
Dewey says: "Dewey High's got basketballs on tap."
Dewey says: "This is my favorite dream."
Dewey says: "Woah, Dewey you're the best, man."
Dewey says: "Okay, I know it."
Huey says: "Uh, what's that?"
Dewey says: "I think it's supposed to be my romantic interest, but I'm too threatened by that concept, so it never takes shape."
Romantic Interest says: "Dewey, let's sing a dew-et."
Dewey says: "Ahh!!"
Romantic Interest says: "Aw."
Dewey says: "Here are my singing rivals."
Dewey says: "They are so self-absorbed."
Dewey says: "Here's a giant poster of me."
Dewey says: "This is in all my dreams."
Dewey says: "I'm like cradled by a moon made of my own tears."
Dewey says: "Who knows what that's about."
Huey says: "I have some theories."
Dewey says: "And this is my mascot."
Dewey says: "Dewey Dude."
Dewey says: "Go, go, go, go, go us us, us, oh, we're dewing it."
Dewey says: "Ha ha ha ha."
Dewey says: "That guy's the best."
Dewey says: "And over here is one of a gajillion trophy cases."
Dewey Dude says: "Lena."
Dewey Dude sheds his costume to reveal...
Magica says: "Miss me?"
Lena pulls fire alarm which activates sprinkler system.
Dewey says: "It's time for my big dance number."
Dewey says: "Oh why did you do that?"
Lena says: "It was an accident."
Dewey says: "You ruined my big dance, and we'll never have the hallway dry in time for the 11:30 number."
Webby says: "Come on, Dewey, none of us feel like dancing."
Webby says: "Maybe we should move on to the next dream."
Huey says: "Yeah, I just failed a class on something called Dewology."
Dewey says: "Well I'm the class valeDEWtorian."
Dewey says: "A plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus..."
Huey says: "I gotta get out of here."
Violet says: "With enough focus, we should be able to determine where we go next."
Louie says: "Hmm."
Webby says: "Louie?"
Louie says: "Mmm, yes?"
Huey says: "This is your dream."
Huey says: "to be even lazier?"
Louie says: "I nap all day, I never have to worry about anything, I'm shamelessly pampered."
Louie says: "Hm hm hm."
Louie says: "Meow."
Louie says: "Everyone pat my head."
Huey says: "Good kitt-OW!"
Louie says: "Never mind, I don't want that anymore."
Huey says: "You're asleep?"
Huey says: "We're in a dream."
Huey says: "How are you sleep sleeping?"
Louie says: "Just am."
Webby says: "Hey, where's Lena?"
Lena emerges from the cat door in the form of a gray wolf with purple eyes, still wearing her friendship bracelet, growling. Her eyes turn back to normal as she retains her former complex.
Lena says: "I don't think I'm doing this right."
The camera moves towards the rest of the kids.
Dewey says: "Whoa!"
Webby says: "Lena?"
Louie jumps up to the top of the couch, scared while screeching and hissing. Violet approaches Lena.
Violet says: "Fascinating."
Violet says: "In dreams, this form can represent Outsider Syndrome."
Violet says: "Perhaps a violent feral instinct?"
Webby says: "Or she's a pack animal and we're her pack."
Beakley says: "A wolf in our house."
Beakley says: "I'll get animal control."
Beakley talks to the animal control officer who happens to be Magica De Spell.
Lena says: "We need to go like right now!"
Huey says: "Okay okay, we can go."
All says: "Ew, this is unpleasant."
Lena says: "Ah, ugh, huh."
Lena says: "What a nice normal looking dream."
Lena says: "Let's stay here."
Dewey says: "Whose dream is this anyway?"
Dewey says: "It's just a room."
Dewey says: "It's so bori--aaahh!"
Dewey says: "Why, Huey, why?"
Dewey says: "Why, Huey, why?"
Huey says: "Whatever do you mean?"
Huey says: "Nothing strange here, just a tall distinguished mature oldest sibling."
Dewey says: "In what world does that description equal this?"
Huey says: "I'm not good at imagination stuff, okay?"
Louie says: "Don't listen to him."
Louie says: "Follow your lame dreams."
Huey says: "Would you kids like a jar of pickles from the topmost shelf?"
Dewey says: "Nooo!!"
All says: "Sure, okay."
Dewey says: "No, no, no nononono!"
Dewey says: "Oh."
Dewey says: "Oh no!"
Dewey says: "Ugh!"
Huey says: "Ugh!"
Dewey says: "Okay, that's enough."
Dewey says: "If we can dream it, we can Dewey it, and it's my dream to be in a montage."
Dewey says: "Infinite back flip."
All says: "PHOOEY!"
Lena says: "Ah!"
Lena says: "Oh, we're in a library?"
Violet says: "My dream is just to read more."
Huey says: "Awesome!"
Quackfaster says: "Shh!"
Huey says: "Awesome."
Scrooge says: "Wake up kids, what are you lot still doing asleep?"
Scrooge says: "It's almost 6 am."
Scrooge says: "Go get some jobs."
Lena says: "Finally."
Lena says: "Well, I guess we're waking up."
Webby says: "Oh, no."
Webby says: "But it was your turn to choose a dream."
Lena says: "It's fine, really."
Scrooge says: "Meh, more porridge for me."
Scrooge says: "Sleep tight."
Quackfaster says: "Shh."
Lena says: "No, Scrooge, come back!"
Webby says: "Lena, are you okay?"
All says: "Lena?"
All says: "Lena?"
All says: "what's going on?"
All says: "What's wrong?"
All says: "Lena?"
All says: "Lena?"
Lena says: "Ah ah aaahh!"
Webby says: "Lena!"
Dewey says: "Oh, she's going to be cold without her sweater."
Webby says: "I'm going in after her."
All says: "Ah ah ahh oof."
Webby says: "Is this Lena's dream?"
Huey says: "I think this is more nightmare."
Magica says: "About time you woke up."
Magica says: "I mean not actually woke up because you wouldn't be trapped in a nightmare realm of my grim devising, so."
Lena says: "No, I was free."
Lena says: "You lost your powers."
Lena says: "What did you do to me?"
Magica says: "Me?"
Magica says: "This is all you."
Magica says: "Did you think you turn out different than me?"
Magica says: "I'm trying to save you."
Magica says: "You came from me."
Magica says: "Evil is in your..."
Magica says: "whatever shadows have instead of blood."
Magica says: "Don't you ever feel like there's something off about you?"
Lena says: "It's just a dream."
Magica says: "Yes, but it is really me."
Magica says: "We're psychically linked, because you know, you, me, same, evil, et cetera."
All says: "Lena."
All says: "Coming, Lena, We're coming."
All says: "Lena, Coming, We're coming to get you."
Lena says: "Hah."
Lena says: "My friends are here."
Lena says: "They're going to save me."
Magica says: "Those dopes are here to stop you like they always try to stop me."
Magica says: "Because we're monsters, Lena."
Lena says: "I'm nothing like you."
Magica hides inside her scepter while Lena transforms into Magica.
Lena says: "Ahh!"
Lena says: "Ugh!"
Lena as Magica says: "No!"
Webby says: "Magica!"
Webby says: "What did you do with Lena?"
Lena as Magica says: "No, no, I am Lena."
Lena as Magica says: "I just look like Magica."
Webby says: "Stop mocking me."
Lena as Magica says: "Oh, why does everything I say sound sarcastic?"
Webby says: "Because you're a monster!"
Lena as Magica says: "No!"
Lena as Magica says: "No, I'm not..."
Lena as Magica says: "a monster!"
Magica says: "Ooh, ironic."
Lena as Magica says: "Webby, help!"
Dewey says: "Take this!"
Dewey says: "Oof!"
Lena as Magica says: "I'm sorry!"
Huey says: "Eh, Ugh!"
Louie says: "Rrrr!"
Huey says: "Ugh!"
Lena as Magica says: "Ugh!"
Violet says: "Ugh: Lena as Magica: Ah!"
Magica says: "No matter how hard you fight it, they will always turn on you."
Magica says: "Give in."
Magica says: "No worrying if you measure up."
Magica says: "If you're too flawed."
Magica says: "You're tired."
Magica says: "Come home to me."
Webby says: "Lena?"
Webby says: "I'm sorry."
Webby says: "I didn't see."
Webby says: "Of course it's you."
Webby says: "Is this what's been bothering you?"
Webby says: "That you might become Magica?"
Lena says: "I'm just so tired of fighting it."
Lena says: "I am her."
Webby says: "No you're not."
Webby says: "We were trying to destroy you, and you still saved me."
Lena says: "Yeah, of course I did."
Lena says: "Of course I would."
Magica says: "What are you doing?"
Magica says: "Don't listen to her."
Magica says: "You are me."
Webby says: "You're not her."
Webby says: "You're you."
Webby says: "You put so much pressure on yourself to be good, but you're good enough."
Magica says: "Give me back my powers, you ungrateful brat!"
Dewey says: "Ew!"
Magica says: "No!"
Lena says: "I'm awake!"
Lena says: "I'm me again!"
Lena says: "We did it!"
Violet says: "Wait, we should test to be certain that this isn't a dream."
Huey says: "That's right."
Huey says: "We might still be dreaming."
Huey says: "Ugh, it's fine."
Huey says: "Fine, we're awake."
Huey says: "It's fine."
Huey says: "Whatever."
Lena and Webby notices a drone outside the window.
Lena says: "Aunt Magica?"
Lena says: "You really have been creeping in my dreams all week."
Magica says: "Night after night, I tried to get you to give your powers back to me, but you kept waking up."
Magica says: "I thought if you had your "friends" to distract you, you'd stay asleep, but no."
Magica says: "You can give my powers back right here, though."
Magica says: "Take my hand."
Magica says: "We're family."
Magica says: "You need me."
Violet says: "She's wearing some sort of telepathic helmet with a neural frequency amplifier."
Violet says: "That's likely how she entered our dreams."
Louie says: "So you're using some weird doohickey?"
Louie says: "Isn't magic your whole thing?"
Lena says: "You really don't have any powers left."
Lena says: "I don't need you."
Lena says: "You need me."
Lena says: "You are no longer allowed in my head."
Lena says: "Ugh!"
Magica says: "Argh!"
Magica says: "I'll claw out your soul, grind your heart to dust beneath my heel, and rip my powers out of you with my bare teeth!"
Lena says: "You know, I feel more rested than I have in a long time."
Louie says: "I could go for a nap."
Magica says: "You think you've won, but I am your fate."
Magica says: "I am the dark force of the core of all things!"
Magica says: "I am Magica De Spell!"
Magica says: "Argh!"
