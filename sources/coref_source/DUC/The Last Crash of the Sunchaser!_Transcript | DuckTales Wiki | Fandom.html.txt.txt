Outside the mansion, Launchpad is loading up the jeep.
Launchpad says: "C'mon!"
Webby says: "Next stop, Monacrow!"
Huey says: "Home to E."
Huey says: "X."
Huey says: "C."
Huey says: "E."
Huey says: "S."
Huey says: "S, the EXtreme Consumer Electronics and Science Symposium."
Huey says: "Experimental race cars!"
Webby says: "Lasers!"
Launchpad says: "Aeroplanes?"
Dewey says: "You bet old friend."
Scrooge says: "And Monacrow is said to be the final resting place of the elusive Maltese MacGuffin."
Scrooge says: "Lost during Netherworld War II, his ephemeral heirloom is so rare that no one has ever laid eyes upon it."
Huey says: "Whoa, so what is it exactly?"
Scrooge says: "The stuff dreams are made of!"
Huey says: "No, but, l..."
Huey says: "like is it a statue, or..."
Huey says: "Come on Uncle Donald, you can fix the houseboat when we get back."
Donald says: "Uh-uh, I'm almost done."
Donald says: "We'll be on the water again in two days!"
Donald says: "Sigh..."
Donald says: "I should get started."
Dewey says: "No rush!"
Webby says: "Granny!"
Webby says: "You're coming too?"
Mrs. Beakley says: "I have 987 vacation days saved up, and Monacrow's black water beaches are legendary."
Mrs. Beakley says: "It's high time I wild it out, with some 'maxing, and relaxing."
Mrs. Beakley says: "Hm?"
Webby says: "I have the coolest grandma!"
Dewey says: "Sure."
Dewey says: "Now who's ready for the: Huey, Dewey, Louie, and Scrooge: Best vacation ever!"
Huey says: "Aw, you'll get it: Scrooge: Six months ago, if you'd have told me I should take in a group of youngins..."
Mrs. Beakley says: "I did."
Scrooge says: "..."
Scrooge says: "I would've called you daft."
Scrooge says: "But I tell ya I haven't felt this energized and vital since..."
Scrooge says: "well a long time."
Scrooge says: "Load up everyone!"
Louie says: "Psst, psst hey."
Dewey says: "Did ya get it?"
Louie nods says: "Scrooge: Come on kids!"

Louie nods says: "TO OUR GREATEST ADVENTURE YET!"
tapping the bag says: "TO OUR GREATEST ADVENTURE YET!"
Everyone says: "WOO HOO!"
Everyone says: "TO ADVENTURE!"
Launchpad drives the jeep into the Sunchaser which takes off shortly afterward.
theme song plays says: "Launchpad: Sorry Mrs B, only seat I could find."
Mrs. Beakley says: "Seatbelts?"
Launchpad says: "Oh, umm..."
Launchpad says: "-grabs an inflatable tube- When we crash it can be used as a flotation device."
Mrs. Beakley says: "When we crash?"
Scrooge says: "Long time since you've been in the field, ey Agent 22?"
Mrs. Beakley says: "And this plane would have been dangerously outdated even then."
Mrs. Beakley says: "I'm counting 1.."
Mrs. Beakley says: "2..."
Mrs. Beakley says: "3.."
Mrs. Beakley says: "4..."
Mrs. Beakley says: "fourteen safety violations."
Launchpad says: "Aw come on."
Launchpad says: "Every time the Sunchaser goes down, she always gets right back up in the air!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "Every time?"
Mrs. Beakley says: "I allow the children to travel with you because I assume you're keeping them safe."
Scrooge says: "Actions!"
Scrooge says: "Launchpad give the old bird the tour of the old bird to show her there's nothing to worry about."
Scrooge says: "I'll take the wheel-stick..."
Scrooge says: "thingy..."
Scrooge says: "?"
Mrs. Beakley says: "Sorry, when did you learn how to fly a massive cargo plane?"
Scrooge says: "Please, I'm Scrooge McDuck!"
Scrooge says: "If Launchpad can do it, how hard can it be?"
Launchpad says: "Not very!"
Launchpad says: "Our tour starts down at the tummy of the plane."
Launchpad says: "Let me know if this gets too technical..."
Louie says: "I sweet talked Quackfaster down at Scrooge's secret archives."
Louie says: "That lady is *nuts*!"
Louie says: "And I got her to give us this."
Huey says: "Start at the corners and work inward."
Webby says: "No Huey, each mysterious piece hold a secret."
Webby says: "Listen closely and they tell you where they go."
Huey says: "It goes there."
Dewey says: "Okay, so what do we got?"
Louie says: "The documents shredded on the week we were born."
Louie says: "According to the note we found in Castle McDuck, that date is connected to..."
Webby says: "..."
Webby says: "the Spear of Selene, the mysterious unknown thing your mom took from Scrooge."
Huey says: "Somewhere in these pieces are the answers Scrooge doesn't want us to find."
Huey says: "What is the Spear of Selene?"
Huey says: "Why didn't Scrooge and Donald talk for years?"
Dewey says: "What happened to our mom?"
Dewey says: "Nothing can stop us..."
Dewey says: "OH, COME ON!"
Dewey says: "Where's the last piece?!"
Dewey says: "!"
Dewey says: "It's gotta be here somewhere!"
Webby says: "There!"
Dewey says: "Aha!"
Dewey says: "Nothing can stop us."
crosstalk between Huey says: "The plane jerks to a halt."
Louie says: "The plane jerks to a halt."
Webby says: "The plane jerks to a halt."
Dewey says: "WHERE'D IT GO?!"
Dewey says: "!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "What just happened?"
Mrs. Beakley says: "Where are the children?"
Huey says: "Quick!"
Huey says: "If they find out we're researching his darkest secret, Scrooge will shut down our investigation for good!"
Huey, Dewey, and Louie whistle.
Mrs. Beakley says: "Are you children alright?"
Webby says: "Inconspicuous whistling..."
Webby says: "just a casual whistle..."
Scrooge says: "Augh you anti-aeronautical patchwork contraption!"
Scrooge says: "Will ya FLY ALREADY?!"
Scrooge says: "!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "McDuck!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "I leave you alone for two minutes and you crash the plane!"
Launchpad says: "If we crashed, then why are we still in the air?"
Everyone gasps says: "Mrs."
Everyone gasps says: "Beakley: Of all the irresponsible..."
Launchpad says: "Not even a real crash."
Scrooge says: "Ah quit your havering."
Scrooge says: "It's just a teeny 10,000-meter speed bump."
Scrooge says: "I'll have us safely on the trail of the Maltese MacGuffin by morning or my name isn't Scrooge Mc- AUGH!!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "And you've blown out an engine."
Scrooge says: "Ah, that happens all the time!"
Scrooge says: "Right Launchpad?"
Launchpad says: "Yes, but usually I crash like two seconds later."
Mrs. Beakley says: "We have to get out and figure out how we get down."
Scrooge says: "And pass up the adventure of a lifetime?!"
Scrooge says: "!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "And risk all our lives?!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "!"
Scrooge says: "Ah your safest houses, this is nothin!"
Scrooge says: "The plane could be on fire!"
Scrooge says: "Or we could be on fire!"
Scrooge says: "Or this could be a volcano!"
Scrooge says: "EVERYTHING could be on fire!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "This is a blatant breech of training protocol AND just basic safety precautions!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "Is this what you're doing when you take the family on road trips?!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "!"
Scrooge says: "Ah you're overreacting!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "I have no idea why you thought this would be a good idea."
Scrooge says: "You're a hysteric."
Scrooge says: "Honestly..."
Launchpad says: "We've seemed to have hit some..."
Launchpad says: "um..."
Launchpad says: "turbulence in the cockpit here."
Launchpad says: "Everything’s fine!"
Launchpad says: "Please enjoy our inflight entertainment."
Darkwing Duck credits theme plays says: "Huey: Now what?"
Dewey says: "NOW THAT!"
Scrooge says: "I'll use the Jeep's engine to jump start the Sunchaser's propeller and we'll be on our way!"
Scrooge says: "What could be safer?"
Mrs. Beakley says: "Calling for help?"
Mrs. Beakley says: "Climbing down on our own?"
Mrs. Beakley says: "Not starting a car inside of a plane!"
Webby says: "We've got to get that piece without anyone noticing."
Webby says: "We'll need some kind of distraction."
Louie says: "Ugh, fine."
Louie says: "Follow my lead."
Launchpad says: "All set up here, mister McDee!"
Scrooge says: "See here Bentina, I have taken the children on countless adventures and they have never once caused a worry about their safety."
Louie says: "Uncle Scrooge!"
Louie says: "We're worried about our safety!"
Scrooge says: "N-now Louie I have always a looked out for you."
Scrooge says: "Why worry now?"
Scrooge says: "At such a potentially embarrassing moment for me?"
Louie says: "I know we've been in tough spots before but this one seems really tough."
Huey says: "He's right."
Huey says: "Given the altitude, the condition of the plane, and the weather patterns, we have a one in 17 million chance of surviving."
Louie says: "I mean yeah, scaary!"
Webby says: "And usually on our expeditions there's some kind of curse or villain that you can outwit."
Webby says: "But you can't outwit gravity!"
Louie says: "Yeah!"
Louie says: "Y..."
Louie says: "yeah yeah t..."
Louie says: "that's right!"
Louie says: "WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!"
Louie says: "WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT OUR SAFETY WE GOTTA GO NOW NOW NOW!!"
Launchpad says: "Now?"
Scrooge says: "NO!"
Dewey says: "No!"
Launchpad says: "Huh, never crashed a Jeep in a plane before."
Launchpad says: "Into a plane, sure."
Launchpad says: "But..."
Launchpad says: "Hm??"
Scrooge says: "Launchpad!"
Scrooge says: "You need to counterbalance the plane!"
Scrooge says: "Everyone to the front!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "Ughh, go go go!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "What is..."
Mrs. Beakley says: "in here??"
Triplets says: "Nothing!"
Webby says: "Nothing!"
Launchpad says: "Uhh, mister McDee?"
Scrooge says: "Gah, Beakly secure the hatch!"
Launchpad says: "Thanks, mister McDee!"
Scrooge says: "Nothing bad will happen when Scrooge McDuck is around!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "Mr McDuck!"
Scrooge says: "Kids!"
Louie says: "Mrs."
Louie says: "Beakley!"
Louie says: "Sorry."
Louie says: "I thought I could keep the blame circle going."
Scrooge says: "Must you blindly gallivant around with no clue what you're doing?!"
Scrooge says: "!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "Mm-hmm, irony."
Scrooge says: "If you cannae listen, I can't keep you safe!"
Scrooge says: "Except of course I can because I am Scrooge McDuck and I am very good at what I do."
Scrooge says: "From here on out you have to *stay put*!"
commercial break says: "Dewey: There's the missing piece!"
commercial break says: "We just have to get it!"
Louie says: "Nope!"
Louie says: "Nuh-uh!"
Louie says: "Nothing is getting me out of this seat!"
Huey says: "What if the plane catches fire and we have to evacuate?"
Louie tries to get out of his seat belts.
Dewey says: "Come on, that puzzle piece may be our best chance to find out why Della disappeared!"
Webby says: "Maybe?"
Dewey says: "Beg your pardon?"
Webby says: "It's just, you said that in the archives, and on Ithaquack, and how can we know for sure?"
Dewey says: "By grabbing the piece!"
Dewey says: "Guys this is the greatest mystery of our lives!"
Louie says: "We can't solve it if we're dead!"
Dewey says: "We'll be fine."
Dewey says: "Scrooge isn't gonna let anything bad happen to us."
Scrooge says: "Stop."
Scrooge says: "Moving!"
Dewey says: "Ugh, see?"
Louie says: "This couldn't get any worse!"
Launchpad says: "This is your captain."
Launchpad says: "To take your minds off of our potentially grim fate, please enjoy another action-packed Darkwing Duck video!"
Launchpad says: "Huh, the tape player seems to have been damaged in the crash."
Launchpad says: "Enjoy!"
Webby, Dewey, and Huey groan.
Launchpad says: "Here are those dirty laundry bags you wanted, Mister McDee."
Mrs. Beakley says: "Launchpad, these are parachutes."
Launchpad says: "They're what-now?"
Mrs. Beakley says: "Ugh, Mister McDuck."
Mrs. Beakley says: "Mister McDuck."
Mrs. Beakley says: "Scrooge!"
Scrooge says: "What?"
Scrooge says: "All I have to do is climb out on the wing to jump-start the propeller myself using these heavy parachutes as counterbalance out the other side of the plane."
Mrs. Beakley says: "Leaving us with no emergency equipment!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "Please, for the safety of your family, admit you cannot fix this."
Scrooge says: "Nonsense, nothing bad is gonna happen to her."
Mrs. Beakley says: "Her who?"
Scrooge says: "Hm?"
Scrooge says: "Uh, the kids."
Scrooge says: "They'll be thanking us by the time we land."
Scrooge says: "Launchpad, hand me another parachute."
Scrooge says: "Launchpad!"
Scrooge says: "Besides the kids are having the times of their lives!"
All except Dewey sing along to the end credits.
Dewey says: "Ugh, I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE, I'M GOING FOR IT!"
Huey says: "DEWEY, NO!"
Huey says: "Junior Woodchuck Rule 18: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction."
Webby says: "I thought that was Newton?"
Huey says: "Where do you think he got it from?"
Webby says: "Science?"
Webby says: "Okay I'll call out the steps!"
Webby says: "Got it?"
Dewey says: "Got it!"
Louie says: "Nope bad idea!"
Louie says: "Terrible idea!"
Dewey says: "For mom."
Webby says: "Ready..."
Webby says: "steady..."
Webby says: "Dewey left, step, step."
Webby says: "Huey right, step, step."
Webby says: "Dewey right."
Webby says: "Huey left."
Mrs. Beakley says: "Please we all believe you are a very capable adventurer, alright?"
Scrooge says: "Stand down 22, I am still your boss."
Scrooge says: "Launchpad now!"
Dewey says: "The truth about Della Duck!"
Webby says: "Walk with the stupid paper already!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "Dewey?"
Scrooge says: "What the blazes?"
Scrooge says: "What have you got there?"
Dewey says: "Nooooooot secrets!"
Louie says: "Literally the worst answer you could have given."
Scrooge says: "Give it here."
Both Scrooge and Dewey gasp as the paper flies to the other side of the plane.
Dewey says: "NO!"
Scrooge says: "Get back here, you'll get yourself killed!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "Both of you, stop speeding through the plane!"
Scrooge and Dewey slowly creep to the other end of the plane.
Mrs. Beakley says: "Ugh that is not what I meant, and you know it."
Dewey says: "Leave me alone!"
Come back here this instant!
Mrs. Beakley says: "You three, counterbalance the weight!"
Scrooge says: "I'm trying to save your life, now come back here or I will end it young man!"
Dewey says: "No!"
Dewey says: "So close!"
Webby says: "Oh no."
Mrs. Beakley says: "Oh children..."
Mrs. Beakley says: "What have you been up to?"
Huey says: "DEWEY!"
Louie says: "DEWEY!"
Webby Mrs. Beakley says: "DEWEY!"
Launchpad says: "DEWEY!"
Scrooge says: "NO!!"
Scrooge says: "LAD!"
Scrooge says: "LAD GIVE ME YOUR HAND!"
Scrooge says: "No, not again."
Webby says: "Dewey, this is crazy!"
Webby says: "The mystery is not worth it!"
Louie says: "I.."
Louie says: "I get it but you can't give up the rest of us to find the one person we lost!"
Launchpad says: "Dewey, the Darkwing Duck video is still running!"
Launchpad says: "Do you want me to pause it until you get back?"
Huey says: "Gimme that!"
Huey says: "Dewey, our family is amazing!"
Huey says: "We're enough, let it go!"
Scrooge says: "Please, I..."
Scrooge says: "I can't keep you safe alright?"
Scrooge says: "How can I get you to listen to me?"
Dewey says: "Tell me about the Spear of Selene."
Scrooge says: "Except..."
Scrooge says: "we've been just about everywhere."
Scrooge says: "Ever the aviator, your mother devised a plan to explore the greatest uncharted territory of all..."
Scrooge says: "outer space!"
Scrooge says: "She found the rocket and decided to go on a little test run in orbit."
Scrooge says: "Neither of us could have predicted, that cosmic storm."
Scrooge says: "But we both knew a little bit of pan-galactic precipitation wouldn't stop her, after all she was Della Duck!"
Scrooge says: "Curse me kilts was that girl stubborn."
Scrooge says: "I tried to talk her through it, I thought if anyone could make it, it was her."
Scrooge says: "Until that very last bolt."
Scrooge says: "I couldn't keep her safe, the rocket and your mother were lost to the inky abyss of space."
Scrooge says: "Your Uncle Donald and I never spoke again until you three showed up on my doorstep."
Louie says: "Dewey: Cool, so you're the reason our mom is gone!"
Huey sob says: "Dewey: Cool, so you're the reason our mom is gone!"
Scrooge says: "What?"
Scrooge says: "No!"
Scrooge says: "I..."
Scrooge says: "I..."
Launchpad says: "Um, guys?"
Dewey says: "You built her a crazy dangerous super rocket!"
Scrooge says: "Which she stole early!"
Huey says: "Then you encouraged her to keep flying through a cosmic storm?"
Huey says: "You could have called her down, there were too many variables!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "Now boys, you don't know..."
Louie says: "And you're the richest duck in the world!"
Louie says: "Why didn't you send up more ships to look for her?"
Scrooge says: "I spared no expense!"
Dewey says: "Yeah, right."
Dewey says: "Cheap old Scrooge probably bailed as soon as it put a dent in his money bin."
Launchpad says: "Um, guys?"
Webby says: "Take it easy Dewey, he may have a point."
Webby says: "Even if gifting an experimental rocket to a mother of three was clearly a terrible idea!"
Scrooge says: "This is a family matter!"
Scrooge says: "You are not family!"
Mrs. Beakley says: "See here McDuck."
Mrs. Beakley says: "You will not speak to my granddaughter that way."
Scrooge says: "You will not speak to me that way!"
Scrooge says: "None of you!"
Scrooge says: "After everything I do for you, you're all nothing but trouble!"
Launchpad says: "Guys!"
Launchpad says: "This is your captain speaking, we are FALLING!"
Everyone else says: "WAIT WHAT?"
Launchpad says: "Huh, that was weird."
Launchpad says: "Phew, there we go!"
Donald says: "Back so soon?"
Donald says: "Well, ta-dah!"
Donald says: "She's all done!"
Donald says: "..."
Donald says: "Uhh, what happened to you?"
Dewey says: "We know about the Spear of Selene."
Donald says: "Oh."
Louie says: "Oh let's go back to the marina."
Webby says: "Isn't he even gonna say goodbye?"
Mrs. Beakley says: "We're taking those vacation days, if that's alright with you, sir."
Scrooge says: "Fine."
Mrs. Beakley says: "Well you've successfully pushed away your family and everyone who cared about you away, again."
Mrs. Beakley says: "I hope you're happy."
flashbacks says: "Louie: You're the richest duck in the world!"
flashbacks says: "Why didn't you send up more ships to look for her?"
Huey says: "Then you encouraged her to keep flying through a cosmic storm."
Huey says: "You could have called her down, there were too many variables!"
Dewey says: "So you're the reason our mom is gone!"
Dewey says: "Cheap old Scrooge probably bailed as soon as it put a dent in his money bin."
Mrs. Beakley says: "Well you've successfully pushed away your family and everyone who cared about you away, again."
Mrs. Beakley says: "I hope you're happy."
Scrooge says: "..."
Scrooge says: "I am."
