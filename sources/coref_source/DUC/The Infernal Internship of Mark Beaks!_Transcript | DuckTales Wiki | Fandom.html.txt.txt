Episode opens with Scrooge and Glomgold staring intently at each other while bagpipe music plays in the background.
Huey says: "Are we going to the store, or..."
Scrooge says: "Quiet."
Scrooge says: "I'm in the middle of a vision beast battle of wills."
Dewey says: "So, it's a staring contest?"
Glomgold says: "It's not just a staring contest,  Nice try, McDuck, but your family bickering will never get me to look away."
Glomgold says: "Never!"
Dewey says: "It's a staring contest."
Usher says: "Excuse me, this area of the Duckburg Billionaires Club is only for our elite members."
Usher says: "The creme de la creme, the finest ducks in Duckburg."
Mark Beaks enters as Huey and Dewey exits.
Huey says: "Is that..."
Huey says: "?"
Mark Beaks says: "I'm tagging us."
Glomgold says: "I'm sorry, who are you?"
Beaks says: "Seriously, Mark Beaks?"
Beaks says: "Founder and CEO of Waddle?"
Beaks says: "Haha."
Beaks says: "Soon-to-be newest addition to the Duckburg Billionaires Club."
Beaks says: "C'mon!"
Beaks shows off his bank account balance, almost reaching one billion dollars. Glomgold shoves it aside without breaking eye contact with Scrooge.
Beaks says: "Aaaand creator of the newest tech innovation, project "Ta-Dah!"
Beaks says: ""?"
Beaks says: "It's everything you think it is, and nothing you're expecting."
Beaks says: "I'll flip you my peep deeds so you can follow my updates."
Scrooge says: "I don't understand half of those words."
Beaks says: "Woah, weird."
Beaks says: "I wouldn't have thought you "successful guys" would be so behind the times."
Beaks says: "Allow me to take to the future."
Beaks says: "Oooohhh!!!"
Huey says: "That was Mark Beaks!"
Huey says: "He's right in there!"
Huey says: "Oh man, I'm almost breathing the same air as him."
Huey says: "Oh, ingenuity."
Dewey says: "C'mon, like I couldn't be a young influential business guy!"
Huey says: "ha ha ha, oh: Dewey: What?"
Huey says: "Oh, oh..."
Huey says: "you were serious?"
Huey says: "It's just..."
Huey says: "you're more the "crazy, irresponsible, fun guy" than the "serious, brilliant, successful guy"."
Dewey says: "You don't know!"
Dewey says: "At least I'm not the guy who reads about people who do stuff guy."
Dewey says: "I could be a bigger deal than Beaks in three years tops."
Dewey says: "I'll pay for that in three years."
Dewey says: "I am very sorry."
Opening theme says: "Beaks: Keep making dat money, y'all, see you at two billion and counting."
Opening theme says: "Stuck-up old money duddies."
Opening theme says: "Don't even have a social media presence."
Dewey says: "Mr."
Dewey says: "Beaks, I'm Dewey, future astronaut, president and..."
Huey says: "CAN YOU SIGN THIS?"
Huey says: "YOU'RE MY HERO AND A GENIUS!"
Beaks says: "Genius?"
Beaks says: "You two!"
Beaks says: "I like how much you like me, that shows real smarts."
Beaks says: "Come by the offices and I'll hook you up with a tour."
Beaks says: "Maybe even an after-school job?"
Beaks says: "Pew-pew-pew-pew, pew..."
Beaks says: "pew-pew-pew."
Huey says: "You mean it?"
Dewey says: "Sure, why not?"
Beaks says: "Amazing-soft."
Beaks says: "I'll text you."
Beaks says: "Internship starts ma√±ana."
Glomgold says: "Och, wallow in the..."
Scrooge says: "What?"
Scrooge says: "Did you say something?"
Glomgold says: "I was just grumbling!"
Scrooge says: "Well, do it louder!"
Glomgold says: "THEN IT'S NOT GRUMBLING!"
Glomgold says: "Gah, I hate this music!"
Scrooge says: "We've got to do something about the new guy."
Glomgold says: "I never had mousse pie!"
Scrooge says: "No, new guy!"
Glomgold says: "Oh."
Glomgold says: "Agreed!"
Glomgold says: "Let's get rid of him."
Glomgold says: "Great, now I want pie!"
Glomgold says: "Wait, no!"
Scrooge says: "Ha!"
Scrooge says: "See you tomorrow, Flinty."
Huey says: "Let's see."
Huey says: "Can-do attitude?"
Huey says: "Check."
Huey says: "Professional posture?"
Huey says: "Check."
Huey says: "Completed checklist."
Huey says: "Check."
Huey says: "Wow, I can't believe we get to be interns at Waddle for Mark Beaks."
Dewey says: "Yeah, I'm mostly doing it to show off  this bad boy."
Huey says: "What is that?"
Dewey says: "Oh, this?"
Dewey says: "It's my super serious business briefcase."
Dewey says: "What brilliant business secrets is he hiding in there?"
Dewey says: "Who knooows?"
Huey says: "You can't open the lock, can you?"
Dewey says: "Nerp."
Beaks says: "Welcome to Waddle."
Beaks says: "Where imagination and innovation get married and have babies."
Beaks says: "Digital high five app so you never get left hanging, or you know, had have to touch anyone."
Beaks says: "Come, roll with Beaks."
Beaks says: "Here are the high impact trampolines, the low impact trampolines, and of course, the no impact trampolines."
Beaks says: "Those are fun."
Employee says: "Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!"
Beaks says: "Slides are the new stairs."
Dewey says: "Huh, that's actually pretty cool."
Huey says: "If, by cool, you mean statistically proven to increase employee productivity."
Huey says: "Heh, this guy."
Beaks says: "Oh, before you ask, yeah, it's all made of candy."
Beaks says: "You're welcome."
Dewey says: "Ooh, wow."
Dewey says: "Who knew work could be so awesome?"
Beaks says: "Mark Beaks did."
Beaks says: "Blammo!"
Dewey says: "He talks the way I want to live!"
Beaks says: "Here are your official Waddle Trainee Beanies."
Beaks says: "Congratulations, weenies!"
Beaks says: "Oh, P."
Beaks says: "S."
Beaks says: "There's only space for one intern, so one of you is going home by the end of the day."
Beaks says: "Cool?"
Beaks says: "Cool."
Beaks says: "Beaks out."
Huey says: "One internship?"
Huey says: "Well, heheh, you really didn't want it anyway, so I'll tell Mr."
Huey says: "Beaks to give it to me."
Dewey says: "Oh no no no no, sliding my way to billions?"
Dewey says: "Licking other people's stuff?"
Dewey says: "It's everything I never knew I always wanted."
Dewey says: "I."
Dewey says: "Am."
Dewey says: "In."
Huey says: "This is about more than just goofing around."
Dewey says: "Woooo!!"
Huey says: "You're doing it wrong."
Huey says: "This is supposed to be efficient, not fun."
Huey says: "Wee."
Beaks says: "Hah, I'm about to be a billionaire, and when Scrooge tries to follow me online, I'll block him."
Beaks says: "Man, you are killing it today, Beaks!"
Guards says: "Hey, you can't go in there."
Guards says: "Stop right there!"
Beaks says: "Oh, neat."
Mr. Beaks, allow me to introduce myself. Falcon Graves, professional corporate saboteur.
Beaks says: "Professional is right, man."
Beaks says: "That suit game is on point."
Graves says: "What are you doing?"
Beaks says: "Yeah, I'm just updating my status to hostage."
Beaks says: "I feel like this could be huge for my online presence."
Beaks says: "Oh, were you not done with your speech?"
Graves says: "Get me to research and development..."
Guard says: "Hey, let him go."
Graves says: "..."
Graves says: "immediately."
Scrooge says: "Turn that nonsense off!"
Glomgold says: "I already tried, it's impossible."
Scrooge hits wall button with his cane and music stops.
Glomgold says: "Well how was I supposed to know the on button and the off button were the same button?"
Scrooge says: "Did you sleep here last night?"
Glomgold says: "Don't be ridiculous."
Glomgold says: "Who can sleep when you're plotting against your nemesis?"
Glomgold says: "That cocky Mark Beaks may be the only man I hate as much as you."
Scrooge says: "I know the feeling."
Glomgold says: "So now I propose that we get rid of him."
Scrooge says: "Do we really need a slide show?"
Glomgold says: "Heh, sweet, naive Scroogie."
Glomgold says: "Leave the devious planning to the professionals."
Glomgold says: "You're in my world now, McDuck."
Scrooge says: "Alright, show me what you got."
Glomgold says: "No, you're actually on my side of the room."
Huey says: "Oooh, task list."
Huey says: "This is a place of dreams."
Huey says: "Oh, I don't know, Dewey."
Huey says: "This looks like a bunch of boring business guy tasks."
Huey says: "You're not really equipped to handle them, so..."
Dewey says: "And lose this internship to you?"
Dewey says: "No way, this place has free snow cones."
Dewey says: "Free snow cones."
Huey says: "Thank you for calling Waddle, please hold."
Huey says: "Thank you for calling Waddle, please hold."
Huey says: "please hold."
Huey says: "Waddle."
Dewey says: "Yep, yep, I totally get it."
Dewey says: "I hate talking on the phone, too."
Dewey says: "So that's why I kick my feet up, I'm leaning back..."
Huey says: "Who are you talking to?"
Dewey says: "Oh, um, busi- ness- man- ning- ton- son?"
Dewey says: "Oh, you just missed him."
Huey says: "Okay, one sandwich cut diagonally with no crusts, no pickles but yes to pickles on the side so you can decide which pickles to use..."
Dewey says: "I got pizza."
Dewey says: "Everybody loves pizza!"
Employees says: "New guy!"
Employees says: "New guy!"
Employees says: "New guy!"
Huey says: "But I'm also the new guy..."
Huey says: "."
Beaks says: "There's the high impact trampolines, the low impact trampolines..."
Graves says: "Mr."
Graves says: "Beaks, is the tour really necessary?"
Beaks says: "Listen Graves, if we're going to keep this hostage stuff on the DL, I gotta act natural, and naturally I give tours of my awesome company!"
Graves says: "Must I wear the hat?"
Beaks says: "You bet."
Beaks says: "All trainees gotta wear the hat, and you are a trainee, right?"
Beaks says: "Boop!"
Beaks says: "Complimentary snow cone?"
Beaks says: "Aaaahhh."
Graves says: "You do realize you're in quite a lot of danger right now?"
Beaks says: "I know!"
Beaks says: "I'm going to be trending online for days."
Beaks says: "Hostage selfie!"
Beaks says: "Backup phones."
Huey says: "Excuse me, Mr."
Huey says: "Beaks?"
Beaks says: "Sup?"
Huey says: "Mr."
Huey says: "Beaks, here's my completed, color-coded, and categorized checklist."
Huey says: "I even made sub categories for..."
Dewey says: "I ordered everybody pizza."
Huey says: "..."
Huey says: "so, who would you say is in the lead for the internship?"
Beaks says: "Oh, uh, I guess you're tied."
Beaks says: "Oh, mandatory dance break!"
Beaks says: "pew pew."
Glomgold says: "And lo, he shall pay for his arrogance as his world crumbles around him, and Beaks will rue the day he heard the name Flintheart Glomgold!"
Glomgold says: "Oh, and Scrooge McDuck, I guess."
Scrooge says: "Oh, are you finished?"
Glomgold says: "What?"
Glomgold says: "Every evil plot starts with a declaration of hatred speech!"
Glomgold says: "Oh, you have so much to learn."
Scrooge says: "Great."
Scrooge says: "Now can we talk about the actual plan?"
Glomgold says: "I thought you'd never ask."
Scrooge says: "I asked several hours ago."
Glomgold says: "Behold."
Glomgold says: "Our scheme to destroy Beaks begins with an invitation to a billionaire's convention on a yacht."
Glomgold says: "We'll tell him we're going, but then we won't show."
Glomgold says: "First slam!"
Scrooge says: "Seems unnecessary, especially the part about the yacht."
Glomgold says: "Emotionally devastated Beaks will seek solace and drown his sorrows at the buffet!"
Scrooge says: "A yacht and a buffet for one person, I'm not paying for that."
Glomgold says: "Fine, we'll use my yacht."
Glomgold says: "Now, distracted by delicious shrimp, Beaks won't realize he's being sailed into an active volcano, where it will get so hot, he'll jump into the yacht's pool, which unbeknownst to him will be filled with sharks!"
Scrooge says: "Where did the sharks come from?"
Glomgold says: "I've got a great shark guy."
Glomgold says: "Beaks will be so terrified by the sharks, he'll forget he's in the volcano, and jump blindly into the lava!"
Glomgold says: "All while we watch from a bridge above."
Scrooge says: "Wait, wait."
Scrooge says: "I thought we wanted to boot him out of our club, not kill him."
Scrooge says: "Although you have tried to kill me countless times, which usually ends up being more annoying than deadly."
Glomgold says: "That's right, I'm a genius."
Glomgold says: "Now pay attention cause this is where it gets complicated."
Beaks says: "Listen."
Beaks says: "I got your most important task yet: Getting my 2:15 artisanal cold pressed coffee."
Beaks says: "Now, I want almond infused foam."
Beaks says: "Not almonds in my foam, infused foam."
Beaks says: "Understood?"
Dewey says: "Coffee with stuff, got it."
Huey says: "You don't even know where it is!"
Huey says: "c'mon c'mon c'mon: Beaks:  Don't try it, it's super broken."
Dewey says: "Beaks."
Dewey says: "Coffee."
Dewey says: "The winner!"
Beaks says: "Oh ah, Um, I'm sorry, why am I getting my 2:15 coffee at 2:14?"
Beaks says: "I didn't get an email about it moving up."
Beaks says: "Hello?"
Beaks says: "Hello?"
Graves says: "Just..."
Graves says: "take..."
Graves says: "the coffee!"
Beaks says: "I didn't become an almost-billionaire by having coffee at random times of the day like some commoner!"
Beaks says: "There's an order to things!"
Beaks says: "MY ORDER!"
Beaks says: "AND I..."
Huey says: "Mr."
Huey says: "Beaks!"
Huey says: "I have your 2:15 coffee at exactly 2:15."
Beaks says: "Ooh, yummy!"
Beaks says: "Man, things got real for a second back there, right?"
Graves says: "How is this not very real?"
Beaks says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah, one sec."
Beaks says: "Kid, what's your name?"
Huey says: "Huey, sir."
Beaks says: "sss oooh, don't love it..."
Beaks says: "How about brand new Waddle Intern Huey?"
Beaks says: "Haha!"
Huey says: "Achieved dream."
Huey says: "Check."
Graves says: "Now can we finally get to project "Ta-Dah!"
Graves says: ""?"
Beaks says: "Woah, is that an ironically fancy briefcase in my super chill work environment?"
Dewey says: "Uh, yeees?"
Beaks says: "What's going on in there?"
Beaks says: "Like brilliant business secrets?"
Dewey says: "You know it."
Beaks says: "Very chill."
Beaks says: "Oh, I like how you roll."
Beaks says: "You are my new vice president of fancy business."
Beaks says: "Intern, you report to him now."
Beaks says: "Boom."
Beaks says: "Beaks out!"
Huey says: "What?!"
Huey says: "!"
Dewey says: "Yes!"
Dewey says: "Faked it, maked it."
Dewey says: "I didn't even know this was my life's dream until today!"
Huey says: "But how did I win, and still lose?"
Huey says: "I worked so hard and had so many completed checklists."
Huey says: "Do you need me to get a briefcase?"
Huey says: "Cause I can go get one and become the vice president of being chill, cause I'm chill."
Huey says: "I'm straight chilling!"
Huey says: "Like a villain, even!"
Dewey says: "Oh no, Huey's broken."
Huey says: "Or, I can be chief manager of being broken!"
Huey says: "Cause anyone can just be anything!"
Huey says: "Look at me, everybody, now I'm the Duke of Making a Mess!"
Dewey says: "Watch out for the Duke!"
Guard says: "Mr."
Guard says: "Beaks, is everything okay?"
Graves says: "Uh, this again?"
Beaks says: "Oh, I missed that last punch."
Beaks says: "Could you prop him back up and do it again?"
Graves says: "No more games!"
Graves says: "You're all my captives now."
Graves says: "You, vice president."
Graves says: "Take me to project "Ta-Dah!"
Graves says: ""!"
Dewey says: "Yes, of course, sure."
Dewey says: "Uuummmm..."
Huey says: "Seriously?"
Huey says: "It's that way."
Dewey says: "It's that way."
Dewey says: "Of course it's that way."
Dewey says: "Sorry, it's my first day, but ehhehh go this way."
Beaks says: "Welcome to the cutting edge of the latest technology."
Beaks says: "See that in the air, what is that?"
Beaks says: "It's called magic."
Graves says: "Open the vault, now."
Beaks says: "Ugh, Fine I'll  "finally take you to project 'Ta-Dah!"
Beaks says: "'" Bleh!"
Beaks says: "Ugh."
Beaks says: "Menacing man, small children, prepare yourselves for my greatest invention."
Graves says: "What?"
Graves says: "Nothing?"
Beaks says: "Everything you think it is, and nothing you're expecting!"
Dewey says: "You got the nothing part right."
Huey says: "So project "Ta-Dah!"
Huey says: "" is a hoax?"
Beaks says: "TA-DAHHHHH!!!"
Beaks says: "I built hype for a fake product, everyone invests in my company, kablam!"
Beaks says: "I'm a billionaire!"
Graves says: "This is ridiculous, I'm calling my employer."
Beaks says: "Go for Beaks."
Graves says: "Grr..."
Graves says: "You've got to be kidding me."
Graves says: "Why would you hire me to steal something that doesn't exist?!"
Graves says: "!"
Dewey says: "So he gets to say project "Ta-Dah!"
Dewey says: "" was stolen, but he still gets to keep the money."
Beaks says: "See?"
Beaks says: "Fancy business gets it."
Beaks says: "Why actually put in the hard work of "inventing" something when I can just tell everybody I did."
Beaks says: "Fake it til you make it, right?"
Beaks says: "And become a billionaire!"
Beaks says: "Buh-bam!"
Beaks says: "Just crossed the mark."
Beaks says: "Aw, count them zeros!"
Beaks says: "One!"
Beaks says: "Two!"
Beaks says: "Three!"
Beaks says: "Four!"
Beaks says: "Five- blah I'm bored."
Beaks says: "You get it."
Beaks says: "And it's all thanks to you bud."
Beaks says: "Get over here, selfington!"
Huey says: "I can't believe I looked up to you."
Dewey says: "You and your whole company are as fake as project "Ta-Dah!"
Dewey says: ""."
Beaks says: "Maybe, but the money and the buzz are very, very real."
Beaks says: "I just got so many followers."
Beaks says: "Gravesie, there's a helicopter waiting for you on the roof."
Beaks says: "You know what?"
Beaks says: "Keep the beanie."
Graves says: "I do not being lied to."
Beaks says: "Ooh, this is fun."
Beaks says: "Where are we going?"
Graves says: "To the roof, so I can toss you off it!"
Glomgold says: "Who loves being a part of my twisted, evil plot?"
Glomgold says: "You, yes you do."
Scrooge says: "Why on earth should we ever need this?"
Glomgold says: "Well, how else is Beak's going to know he's at the annual carrot festival?"
Glomgold says: "You clearly didn't understand the plan."
Glomgold says: "Let's start from the beginning."
Glomgold says: "Behold!"
Glomgold says: "Our..."
Scrooge says: "No!"
Scrooge says: ""Backstabbing Scrooge: Version 3" what-- What's this?"
Glomgold says: "Oh, i-it's nothing!"
Scrooge projects the slides, revealing Glomgold's plan to make Scrooge fall into the same lava that Beaks would jump into.
Scrooge says: "This whole thing is a trap for me, isn't it?"
Glomgold says: "Whaaaaat?"
Glomgold says: "Nooooooo."
Glomgold says: "Of course not."
Glomgold says: "Your new best friend would neeeever..."
Glomgold says: "No, stay right there."
Glomgold says: "Uh, thank goodness you moved at the last minute or you would have been destroyed by the axe."
Scrooge says: "How long have you been planning that one?"
Scrooge says: "More than six months?"
Glomgold says: "I don't want to say."
Scrooge says: "I can't believe I wasted a whole day obsessing over someone I don't like, and it nearly got me killed."
Scrooge says: "Who am I?"
Scrooge says: "You?"
Scrooge says: "Ugh."
Scrooge says: "Have fun with your new nemesis."
Scrooge says: "I'm going to go beat you both by actually being a better billionaire."
Beaks says: ""Help, project 'Ta-Dah!"
Beaks says: "' was stolen, and now I'm going to be tossed off the roof."
Beaks says: "" Oh, should I add a sad face, or is that too much?"
Beaks says: "Oh, ground."
Beaks says: "Dude, not cool!"
Beaks says: "That's my last backup phone!"
Graves says: "Just..."
Graves says: "stop!"
Dewey says: "We gotta save Beaks, right?"
Dewey says: "I mean, he's the worst, but it's the right thing to do."
Huey says: "Why?"
Huey says: "I'm sure your Biggest Favorite Friend will just fake his way through it like everything else."
Dewey says: "Okay, first off, that's not what BFF stands for."
Dewey says: "And secondly, guys like him, guys like me, we have to put on a show and fake it because smart guys like you are so good at making it."
Dewey says: "We don't need this."
Dewey says: "What we need..."
Dewey says: "."
Dewey says: "is a checklist."
Dewey says: "In fact, here's a checklist for how to get through this."
Dewey says: "One, get a plan."
Dewey says: "Two, ask Huey for a plan."
Dewey says: "Three, do you have a plan yet, cause honestly I don't know how checklists work."
Huey says: "I got it."
Huey says: "Hey, Graves, over here."
Dewey says: "This is dumb, I hate this plan."
Beaks says: "Haha, I win."
Beaks says: "Oh gross, your dumb fingerprints smudged my screen."
Huey says: "Now go be Dewey!"
Dewey says: "Take this!"
Dewey says: "And all of these!"
Graves says: "Time Out!"
Graves says: "We have to take off these stupid hats."
Graves says: "It's humiliating."
Dewey says: "Time in!"
Huey says: "Dewey, whatever you do, do not tell Graves what's in the briefcase!"
Graves says: "What is in the briefcase?"
Dewey says: "Oh, this briefcase?"
Dewey says: "Just a bunch of fancy business secrets."
Dewey says: "Very hush-hush, you see the lock?"
Graves says: "Give me that."
Graves says: "What's the code?"
Dewey says: "Try 1111."
Graves says: "No."
Dewey says: "Mmm, 'kay, 2222?"
Graves says: "No!"
Dewey says: "Alright, of course not, 3333..."
Graves says: "Now, now, you're just guessing."
Huey says: "Have you tried the factory default?"
Dewey says: "Of course I..."
Dewey says: "Oh, okay..."
Graves falls off the roof, but safely lands on the high impact trampoline.
Graves says: "Aaahhh, That's it I'm done!"
Graves says: "and I'm untagging myself from all those photos."
Huey says: "That's gotta be 20 million dollars!"
Huey says: "Where did you get a briefcase full of money?"
Dewey says: "Next to the suit of armor in the Billionaires Club."
Dewey says: "That place needs better security."
Mark Beaks says: "'Sup over here?"
Huey says: "Um, we saved your life."
Mark Beaks says: "Right."
Mark Beaks says: "Hey, so obviously I have to fire you guys because you know the secret of Project "Ta-dah," and if you tell anybody I'll just say you're lying¬†because you're mad I fired you."
Mark Beaks says: "Cool?"
Mark Beaks says: "Cool."
Mark Beaks says: "Cool."
Dewey¬†snatches his phone and starts typing.
Dewey says: ""My face looks like a butt."
Dewey says: "" And..."
Dewey says: "sent."
Mark Beaks says: "Seriously, that's your big plan?"
Huey says: "It already has a thousand likes!"
Mark Beaks says: "What?"
Mark Beaks says: "No!"
Mark Beaks says: "No!"
Mark Beaks says: "I can't delete it now!"
Mark Beaks says: "Give it Back!"
Mark Beaks says: "Give it Back!"
In slow motion Huey drops his phone causing Mark Beaks to shout out "NO" then he jumps off the the building and grabs his phone. With tears in his eyes, he types "#YOLO", presses send, and hugs his phone tight. In normal speed He lands on the same trampoline and then it bounces him to the ground.
Beaks says: "Ha!"
Beaks says: "Me and my phone are fine!"
Beaks says: "Haha, we totally crushed that fall!"
Beaks says: "Aw, man!"
Glomgold In disguise.
Letter for billionaire Mark Beaks.
Beaks says: "Aha!"
Beaks says: "That's me."
Beaks says: "I still get to be a Duckburg billionaire!"
Glomgold says: "And everything that comes with it."
