Episode Info says: "Transcript: Gallery: Clips: A pair of night vision lenses crawls through the darkness: Webby: Hey Guys!"
Episode Info says: "Ugh!"
Episode Info says: "Come on, where is everybody?"
Penumbra says: "Ugh!"
Penumbra says: "Rotten Earth gravity."
Webby says: "Hey Penny."
Penumbra says: "Augh!"
Penumbra says: "Oh, Small Della."
Penumbra says: "You shouldn't sneak up on a moon warrior."
Penumbra says: "Do you..."
Penumbra says: "want something?"
Webby says: "No, I definitely wouldn't want to hang out with and/or swap battle techniques with a super cool alien war hero living in our back yard."
Webby says: "Hup, hah."
Webby says: "That's crazy, and you're obviously too busy, right?"
Penumbra says: "Yes, building a ship so my Moonlanders and I can return to our vastly superior Planet Moon."
Webby says: "Oh, sure."
Webby says: "I've got a lot going on too."
Webby says: "Oh!"
Webby says: "There you guys are."
Webby says: "What's the plan for today?"
Dewey says: "Ottoman Empire."
Webby says: "Again?"
Webby says: "But you seen this episode already."
Louie says: "I like knowing how it ends."
Louie says: "It's comforting."
Webby says: "Hmm."
Webby says: "C'mon, let's get out there."
Webby says: "We could catch caterpillars."
Webby says: "In their cocoons, they literally melt into butterflies."
Webby says: "Nature puns!"
Glomgold says: "Hi, I'm TV's Glomgold."
Glomgold says: "You may remember me as EARTH'S GREATEST HERO!"
Glomgold says: "Ah ha ha ha ha ha!"
Glomgold says: "You're probably thinking that handsome lion-heart couldn't possibly give the people of Duckburg any more."
Glomgold says: "WRONG AGAIN!"
Glomgold says: "From the visionary mind that brought you the Glom-coaster, behold, the Flint Ferris Glom Wheel!"
Glomgold says: "Unveiling tonight at Duckburg pier."
Webby says: "Hmm, on the one hand it's Glomgold."
Webby says: "But on the other hand, GIANT FERRIS WHEEL!"
Webby says: "What do you think, Dewey?"
Dewey says: "I remember when the Glom-coaster opened."
Dewey says: "I waited all morning, but I let a kid, Timmy Jenkins, go ahead of me."
Dewey says: "The track broke, and he was stuck for hours."
Dewey says: "It was national news on every channel."
Dewey says: "And as I watched him tell his horrifying story on a dozen different talk shows I thought, THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME UP THERE!"
Dewey says: "Well, not today, Timmy Jenkins!"
Dewey says: "Today is Dewey's dew-saster day."
Webby says: "Woo hoo!"
Webby says: "What could go wrong?"
Dewey says: "Hopefully everything!"
Opening theme says: "Della:  Hey friend!"
Penumbra says: "Hello, best..."
Penumbra says: "friend."
Della says: "Just like old times, except it's you building the rocket in my backyard."
Della says: "Heh heh, need a hand?"
Penumbra says: "Ah yes, thank you Della."
Della says: "You know, Penny, you don't have to leave."
Della says: "You haven't even experienced any of Earth yet."
Penumbra says: "Not true."
Penumbra says: "I went out for "Earth" coffee."
Della says: "Out?"
Della says: "Like a date?"
Della says: "With who?"
Launchpad says: "So..."
Launchpad says: "Do you get Darkwing Duck on the moon, or?"
Penumbra says: "This is terrible."
Della says: "Launchpad?"
Penumbra says: "More evidence that my focus should be here building this ship."
Penumbra says: "Ungh!"
Penumbra says: "not exploring your planet."
Della says: "Or..."
Della says: "maybe..."
Della says: "you're just a teeny weeny bit scared of trying new things?"
Penumbra says: "I am not scared of..."
Penumbra says: "Ah!"
Penumbra says: "an earth joke."
Della says: "Oh!"
Della says: "ah ha ha!"
Della says: "Yeah."
Penumbra says: "Hah!"
Penumbra says: "That's very funny because obviously, I fear nothing."
Dewey says: "Mom!"
Penumbra says: "Ow!"
Dewey says: "Can I go ride a death wheel at the pier so I can be famous?"
Della says: "Sounds awesome."
Della says: "Oh!"
Della says: "why don't you take Penny?"
Della says: "Maybe teach her a little earth fun, eh?"
Webby says: "Teaching the moon's greatest warrior about earth fun?"
Webby says: "Yay!"
Penumbra says: "Urgh!"
Webby says: "You're gonna love it."
Webby says: "We'll walk the pier, play games, eat hamburgers!"
Penumbra says: "I'm sorry, Small Della, but I can't."
Penumbra says: "I have a very important meeting with my fellow moonlanders to discuss our imminent departure."
Penumbra says: "What do you mean you want to stay?"
Gibbous says: "Oh Penumbra, Earth is just wonderful."
Zenith says: "Who would have thought failing to knock the earth out of orbit would be the best thing that ever happened to us."
Penumbra says: "But what about the moon?"
Penumbra says: "What about me..."
Gibbous says: "Oh that was great, but we're having a real barrel of monkeys here."
Penumbra says: "A..."
Zenith says: "It's earth speak for fun."
Gibbous says: "Ah, but it is not all frivolity."
Gibbous says: "I have an important job working for Flintheart Glomgold, the hero of Earth."
Gibbous says: "Why, he told me that he single-handedly saved the planet from Lunaris and his terrible moon scum."
Penumbra says: "Gibbous, "we're" the moon scum, and I stopped Lunaris."
Gibbous says: "Ha, Penumbra, I'm so sorry, but I don't think a hero like Flintheart Glomgold would lie, do you?"
Penumbra says: "okay, fine."
Penumbra says: "The rest of my loyal moonlanders and I can go home, then."
Zenith says: "But Penumbra, everyone else is having a wonderful time too."
Gibbous says: "Why just the other day at Palus's party, ah- ooh!"
Penumbra says: "Party?"
Gibbous says: "Palus hosted a fantastic earth party with yo-yos and festive springs and other earth stuff."
Gibbous says: "it was, well it was fantastic."
Penumbra says: "Why did no one tell me of this party?"
Zenith says: "Well..."
Zenith says: "because..."
Gibbous says: "You hate earth fun."
Penumbra says: "I don't hate earth fun, I just prefer moon, fight, and destroy my enemies."
Gibbous says: "Oh, look at the time, will you?"
Gibbous says: "Uh, that's an earth expression for "I want to leave now."
Gibbous says: "" Let's go, good boy."
Zenith says: "Penumbra, we want nothing more than for you to experience the wonders of earth ways with us, but we understand if you're afraid if you don't want to."
Penumbra says: "Rargh!"
Dewey says: "Come on Webby, I'm gonna be local news bait- AH!"
Penumbra says: "I must conquer earth fun."
Webby says: "YAY!"
Glomgold says: "Why, who is that handsome man?"
Gibbous says: "Why, it's you, sir."
Glomgold says: "Good answer, martian."
Glomgold says: "You are so much better than my last assistant."
Glomgold says: "With Owlson it was always "no, it's too dangerous, for the last time I'm not your assistant."
Glomgold says: "" But you respect the genius of Earth's greatest hero."
Glomgold says: "Don't you, martian?"
Gibbous says: "I'm actually from the moon."
Gibbous says: "Oh, Mars is nice."
Glomgold says: "And now I'm finally gonna give this town what it really needs."
Glomgold says: "Ah ha ha ha ha ha."
Gibbous says: "Sir, you are just..."
Gibbous says: "just so giving."
Glomgold says: "I need you to make sure nothing goes wrong tonight."
Glomgold says: "Can I count on you, martian?"
Gibbous says: "Yes, sir!"
Webby says: "Earth fun lesson one, the best way to ride in a limo."
Penumbra says: "Without my helmet I am completely vulnerable to attacks up here."
Penumbra says: "Why is this fun?"
Webby says: "You're letting your hair blow in the wind."
Webby says: "Try shouting like this."
Webby says: "WOOOO!!"
Penumbra says: "AAAHHH!"
Penumbra says: "Don't even think of attacking my exposed head!"
Dewey says: "Okay, what do you think of my new look for the news?"
Dewey says: "I'm going for traumatized, but not so traumatized I can't do multiple interviews."
Dewey says: "Launchpad?"
Launchpad says: "Dewey, can I ask you a best friend question?"
Dewey says: "Uh..."
Dewey says: "sure?"
Launchpad says: "Penumbra and I got coffee, and it was so bad."
Launchpad says: "She and I should never date, but now I don't know how I'm supposed to act around her."
Launchpad says: "Do I ignore her?"
Launchpad says: "Is that mean?"
Launchpad says: "Am I supposed to be mean?"
Launchpad says: "Dewey, am I her arch enemy now?"
Dewey says: "I..."
Dewey says: "don't know."
Dewey says: "I mean, I mean she's pretty hard to read."
Penumbra says: "Bleh!"
Penumbra says: "You will not defeat me earth beasts."
Penumbra says: "Attack!"
Penumbra says: "Augh!"
Launchpad says: "Do you think she's mad that I'm driving her to this thing?"
Launchpad says: "Should I drive slower?"
Launchpad says: "Should "you" drive?"
Dewey says: "L."
Dewey says: "P."
Dewey says: ", Why don't you just talk to her?"
Launchpad says: "Yes, thank you, wise Dewey."
Dewey says: "Launchpad, wait!"
Dewey says: "Not now!"
Launchpad says: "Penumbra, should I drive slower?"
Launchpad says: "Or would you rather one of the kids drive?"
Launchpad says: "Oh jeez you're right."
Launchpad says: "I should just leave."
Launchpad says: "I'm sorry."
Penumbra says: "We've lost the pilot."
Launchpad says: "Ah L."
Launchpad says: "P."
Launchpad says: ", you definitely should have just kept driving the limo."
Webby says: "Ahhh!!"
Dewey says: "Ahhh!!"
Dewey says: "Ugh, ugh."
Dewey says: "This seat belt will be the death of us all."
Webby says: "Penny, we need to stop the limo."
Penumbra says: "If this wheeled monstrosity must be slain then I shall slay it."
Webby says: "No!"
Webby says: "Use the brakes!"
Penumbra says: "Alright, "limo," Augh!"
Penumbra says: "Let's see you best the moon's greatest- Ugh!"
Penumbra says: "Dah!"
Penumbra says: "Curse this terrible Earth gravity!"
Webby jumps to the driver's seat and slams on the brakes. The limo stops just short of falling into the pier and Penumbra falls into a pile of fish.
Webby says: "Yay, Earth fun, right?"
Penumbra says: "Right, monkey barrels."
Glomgold says: "Behold!"
Gibbous says: "Oh my craters."
Gibbous says: "It's smiling."
Gibbous says: "Delightful!"
Glomgold says: "I think that will really "blow him away," ha ha."
Builder says: "What am I supposed to do with all of these extra parts?"
Glomgold says: "Ah, throw them in one of the glam-dolas."
Gibbous says: "Sir, this truly is a marvel, but are all these parts not necessary for safety?"
Glomgold says: "Safety, right."
Glomgold says: "I guess you better call the safety inspector Ha ha-ha ha-ha."
Gibbous says: "Yes, yes I shall definitely "call the safety inspector ha ha-ha ha-ha."
Glomgold says: "Ah, that's why I love you, martian."
Glomgold says: "Oy!"
Glomgold says: "Don't take that down!"
Glomgold says: "It's supposed to have spikes!"
Gibbous says: "Hello, Safety Inspector "Ha ha-ha ha-ha?"
Dewey says: "We gotta get to the Glom-wheel."
Dewey says: "I will not be "Timmy Jenkinsed" our of my spot in line and the nation's hearts."
Webby says: "Dewey, we're here to show Penny a good time, and as your earth fun teacher, I made a list of everything we should try."
Webby says: "Oh, like this."
Penumbra says: "This statue is very poorly constructed."
Penumbra says: "I question the choice to make it out of..."
Penumbra says: "flesh?"
Webby says: "Ahem."
Actor says: "Why, thank you."
Penumbra says: "Ah!"
Penumbra says: "Deceptive flesh robot!"
Webby says: "Alright, alright, okay don't startle the bloodthirsty alien soldier."
Webby says: "That's on me."
Webby says: "On with the list!"
Penumbra, Webby and Dewey partake in the carnival activities. Launchpad catches up, offers Penumbra some popcorn and jumps off the pier. Penumbra stares in confusion as Webby and Dewey feed popcorn to non-anthropomorphic ducks. Webby gets Penumbra to wear roller skates.
Penumbra says: "I hate this."
Penumbra says: "I hate this."
Penumbra says: "I hate this."
Penumbra says: "I hate this!"
Webby says: "It's okay."
Webby says: "Let go."
Webby says: "There's nothing to be afraid of."
Penumbra says: "I couldn't be afraid of stupid- WOAH!"
Launchpad says: "Oh, Uh, I, I didn't know you were coming out here too."
Penumbra says: "What earth psychopath decided to put wheels on feet?"
Dewey says: "Man, we tried everything."
Webby says: "I have one more thing no one can resist."
Dewey says: "Webby, we all want to help, but wait a second, is that Timmy Jenkins?"
Dewey says: "I gotta get in line."
Penumbra says: "Oh, well this has been a very enlightening lesson on earth fun, but now I think you should take me back to the hangar."
Webby says: "Oh, don't give up."
Penumbra says: "I'm not giving up."
Penumbra says: "I have learned that I was right, and the other moonlanders were wrong, and earth is the worst, and I'm ready to leave."
Penumbra says: "I don't need to change."
Penumbra says: "I am perfect on the mighty Planet Moon."
Penumbra says: "I was the fearless protector of my people for years, and I can't do that here."
Webby says: "Is that what you're afraid of?"
Penumbra says: "I..."
Penumbra says: "fear..."
Penumbra says: "nothing!"
Penumbra says: "Doh!"
Penumbra says: "Ugh!"
Webby says: "Ha ha."
Webby says: "Uh, for most of my life, I stayed in the mansion and studied."
Webby says: "I was Webby, expert on all things McDuck."
Webby says: "But then I left, got out into the world, and the world was big."
Webby says: "I didn't really fit in or even know where to start."
Webby says: "Sometimes I wished I could go back to the mansion where I knew exactly who I was."
Webby says: "But the guys, my family, showed me new and amazing and wonderful things."
Webby says: "I'm still mansion Webby, but I'm also world-explorer Webby, and best-friend Webby."
Webby says: "You will always be moon Penumbra, and if you give it a chance, I bet you could also be a pretty great earth Penumbra."
Penumbra says: "What is this?"
Webby says: "It's a hamburger."
Penumbra says: "This is..."
Penumbra says: "actually quite good."
Penumbra says: "Mmm."
Penumbra says: "Mmm."
Penumbra says: "I mean it's no cooked moon scorpion, but could I possibly get another?"
Penumbra says: "Hmm, to be honest, small Della, this is a relief."
Penumbra says: "I've been on a hunger strike since I got to Earth."
Webby says: "If you like that, you'll love this."
Webby says: "Just try it."
Webby says: "Trust me."
Penumbra says: "Hmm, it's so creamy, so sweet, I've never had anything like this before."
Penumbra says: "Hmm, hmm, hmm."
Webby says: "Okay, maybe you should slow down a bit."
Penumbra says: "Uh-uh, this is great."
Penumbra says: "What's happening?"
Penumbra says: "Ah!"
Penumbra says: "There's some kind of monster in my head stabbing it with little spears."
Webby says: "Penny, it's okay."
Webby says: "It's just brain freeze."
Penumbra says: "It's freezing my brain?"
Penumbra says: "You knew this would happen?"
Webby says: "Uh..."
Penumbra says: "Augh!"
Penumbra says: "Arrgh!"
Glomgold says: "And now, to cut the ribbon opening the Flintferris Glomwheel, Duckberg's own Timmy Jenkins."
Dewey says: "Boo!"
Inspector says: "What is going on here?"
Gibbous says: "Sir, I've summoned Safety Inspector "Ha ha-ha ha-ha."
Glomgold says: "Martian, you weren't actually supposed to get the safety inspector."
Glomgold says: "That's why I used "air quotes."
Gibbous says: "Oh, I thought that was an earth gesture for funny finger bunnies."
Gibbous says: "Yay, earth fun."
Glomgold says: "No, no earth fun."
Inspector says: "Sir, this "ride" is clearly a hazard to public safety."
Inspector says: "I'll have to take a closer look."
Glomgold says: "NO!"
Glomgold says: "You cannae!"
Penumbra says: "Augh!"
Penumbra says: "I HATE EARTH!"
Gibbous says: "Penumbra?"
Glomgold says: "Her!"
Glomgold says: "That moonlander is obviously mad that I defeated the moon."
Glomgold says: "She, uh, sabotaged my ride for revenge."
Glomgold says: "Get her!"
Penumbra says: "Nagh!"
Penumbra says: "Urrr!"
Guard says: "You!"
Guard says: "Moon menace!"
Penumbra says: "Can't fight..."
Penumbra says: "in my weakened state."
Webby says: "C'mon!"
Launchpad says: "Ugh!"
Penumbra says: "How could I've been foolish enough to fall for earth ways just so you could use them to mock me."
Penumbra says: "This day has proven that the earth has nothing for me."
Penumbra says: "When we escape, I'm going back to the moon..."
Penumbra says: "alone."
Inspector says: "Hey, there's that moon lady!"
Webby says: "Whoop!"
Penumbra says: "Ah!"
Dewey says: "Yulp!"
Dewey says: "Yah ha!"
Dewey says: "First in line."
Dewey says: "Eat your heart out, Timmy Jenkins."
Webby says: "Nngh!"
Dewey says: "Hey!"
Guard says: "Hey, get out of that glom-dola."
Guard says: "It's not safe."
Glomgold says: "Quick, start the wheel."
Gibbous says: "Oh, yes sir."
Dewey says: "Ahh!"
Webby says: "Aahh!"
Glomgold says: "Citizens of Duckburg, to celebrate the historic day that I, Flintheart Hero-of-Earth Glomgold, gave you the gift of life, I present you with an even better gift."
Glomgold says: "A world without Scrooge McDuck!"
Glomgold says: "Behold, the Flint Ferris War Wheel!"
Inspector says: "Technically, that shoddy wheel could never withstand the force of a cannon."
Inspector says: "It'll fall to bits before he can even fire it."
Penumbra says: "The small Dellas!"
Dewey says: "Ahh!"
Crowd says: "Ahh!"
Webby says: "Ugh!"
Dewey says: "the news is here."
Dewey says: "Finally."
Dewey says: "Ha ha!"
Dewey says: "Wait, no!"
News says: "Timmy, over here!"
Dewey says: "Nooooo!"
Dewey says: "Aaaahhh!"
Penumbra says: "I have to get them before this wretched monstrosity falls apart."
Glomgold says: "Martian, stop her."
Gibbous says: "Very well, sir, but this has ceased to be fun."
Launchpad says: "Go!"
Launchpad says: "Save them!"
Launchpad says: "Ugh, woah-oah oah oah!"
Penumbra says: "Gibbous, I need you to help me have some earth fun."
Gibbous says: "Oh, absolutely, Penumbra."
Gibbous says: "About time: Glomgold: Martian, what are you doing?"
Penumbra says: "Woah-oah-oah, oof!"
Penumbra climbs up the side of the ferris wheel and rips open the glom-dola that the kids are in.
Webby says: "Penny, I'm so sorry."
Webby says: "This is all my fault."
Webby says: "I shouldn't have pushed you."
Penumbra says: "Ah ha ha ha, are you kidding?"
Penumbra says: "I am having a barrel of monkeys."
Dewey says: "Really?"
Webby says: "Really?"
Penumbra says: "You're much cuter than the moonlanders, and the beasts on the moon were never this big."
Penumbra says: "This is my kind of earth fun."
Penumbra says: "Ha, take that, Palus."
Dewey says: "Wait, hold me so the cameras can see my terrified face."
Dewey says: "Aahh!"
Glomgold says: "No!"
Glomgold says: "No!"
Glomgold says: "Ahh!"
Glomgold says: "Curse you, Me-ferris Me-wheel!"
Inspector says: "Safety violation fines, bills for damage to the pier, and a thank-you letter from Timmy Jenkins."
Gibbous says: "Don't you worry, sir."
Gibbous says: "Your next giant wheel cannon will surely be a success."
Glomgold says: "Oh sweet Gibbous, I cannae stay mad at you."
Penumbra says: "What?"
Penumbra says: "no, we're not enemies."
Penumbra says: "I just do not wish to date an earth..."
Penumbra says: "male."
Launchpad says: "Oh, that's way easier."
Penumbra says: "But you would be a formidable ally on the battlefield."
Launchpad says: "Yeah."
Penumbra says: "I'm fascinated by your earth fighting techniques."
News says: "So great."
Dewey says: "No, it's Dewey's disaster day."
Dewey says: "Dewey's!"
Timmy says: "Better luck next time, Dewey."
Dewey says: "JENKINS!!!!"
Gibbous says: "Then she saved the children right as the wheel crashed into the bay."
Zenith says: "That is amazing."
Della says: "In hindsight, I totally shouldn't have let you kids do that."
Della says: "It could have been a disaster."
Dewey says: "I wish."
Dewey says: "Jenkins!"
Webby says: "So Penny, does this mean you're going to stay?"
Launchpad says: "Hey, Penumbra."
Penumbra says: "Speaking of which, Launchpad and I are going to tear down my ship."
Penumbra says: "He's surprisingly adept at dismantling aircraft."
Della says: "That is true- Woah!"
Penumbra says: "I will need your assistance as well, best friend."
Penumbra says: "Come, blue Della."
Zenith says: "Oh, oh Penumbra, will we see you at Palus's next week?"
Penumbra says: "Sure, it's going to be a monkey barrel."
Gibbous says: "Oh?"
Della says: "A what?"
