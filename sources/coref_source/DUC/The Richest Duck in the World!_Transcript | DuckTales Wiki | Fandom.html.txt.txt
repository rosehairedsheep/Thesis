opening theme says: "Hi."
opening theme says: "Thanks for coming."
Scrooge says: "Ah, to breakfast?"
Louie says: "So, do you remember that bet that you made with Glomgold where the winner won the loser's fortune, and technically I won both your fortunes so that I could give it back to you?"
Scrooge says: "It was yesterday."
Scrooge says: "What are you trying to say, lad?"
Louie says: "Well, I'm keeping it all, so I can be the richest duck in the world!"
Scrooge says: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
Scrooge says: "You, ha ha, are going to be the richest duck in the world?"

Louie says: "Of- of course it did, Owlson."
Louie says: "I have worked hard for three whole months."
Louie says: "I deserve this."
Louie says: "It's time to get down to business."
Louie says: "Hyah."
Louie says: "The business of being crazy rich."
Louie says: "Much better."
Louie says: "I'm the richest duck in the world!"
Louie says: "Woo hoo!"
Della says: "Hey, Penny."
Della says: "It's Della, again."
Della says: "Thought you moon landers would be here to visit by now."
Della says: "I stocked up the fridge, I got air mattresses for everybody, and I know I shouldn't have, but I got you something special."
Della says: "Eh?"
Della says: "Heh heh, don't you want to come spar with this?"
Della says: "Heh heh."
Della says: "Oh, hey."
Della says: "These are the kids!"
Della says: "Huey, Dewey, and I tried to get Louie, but his assistant said he was in the middle of a "complex business deal."

Della says: "She's like their you."
Webby says: "Hyah!"
Huey says: "What is this?"
Della says: "Sending a message to my friends back on the moon."
Dewey says: "This is beaming out to the galaxy?"
Della says: "Yep, they were supposed to follow right after me, but I haven't heard from them."
Della says: "So I've been sending them transmissions like I sent you."
Della says: "The ones I sent you from the moon?"
Della says: "Hundreds of hours of heartfelt lessons that gave me hope and purpose?"
Huey says: "We did not get those."
Della says: "Ugh, meh, eh, it's fine."
Della says: "Everything's fine."
Dewey says: "Ulp."
Della says: "Augh, now I've got no camera, and no way to get a message to the moon."
Dewey says: "Ooooooooooooooooohhhhhhh..."
Huey says: "Oh, no."
Della says: "What?"
Della says: "What did I say?"
Webby says: "There's no stopping it now."
Della says: "Stopping what now?"
Dewey says: "Live from Earth, it's the first ever intergalactic episode of Dewey Dew-night in space, space, space, space."

Owlson says: "You have a 9 o'clock call with your investors, and a 9:15 with the prime minister of Henmark and..."
Owlson says: "Wow, that suit is bright."
Louie says: "Emeralds: the gentleman's gem."
Louie says: "You gotta dress for success, and I am very successful now."
Louie says: "In fact, send out a memo."
Louie says: "Everyone in the building should be wearing emeralds."
Owlson says: "Right."
Louie says: "Uh, okay."
Louie says: "Hang on."
Louie says: "Just gotta get comfortable."
Louie says: "Maybe just."
Louie says: "Ugh, if there was only something I could put my feet up on."
Louie says: "Some kind of furniture for your feet."
Owlson says: "What's happening?"
Louie says: "The greatest reunion in television history!"
Johnny says: "Randy."
Randy says: "Johnny."
Louie says: "You see, Randy thought he was too handsome to build ottomans on their reality show, and Johnny never got over his brother's betrayal."
Johnny says: "I swore I'd never work with him again."
Johnny says: "Not for all the money in the world."
Louie says: "I'll give you one hundred million dollars."
Owlson says: "What?!"
Owlson says: "!"
Johnny says: "Let's get tufting!"
Randy says: "Let's get tufting!"
Louie says: "Now let the rich life of Louie Duck begin."
Johnny and Randy build an ottoman. Louie writes a check.
Owlson says: "The board wants to see you."
Louie says: "Ugh."
Bradford says: "We need to discuss the..."
Bradford says: "ottoman incident."
Louie says: "Oh, it's great, isn't it?"
Louie says: "It was not cheap, though."
Bradford says: "And, how exactly does this ottoman benefit the company?"
Bradford says: "This is a business, not a bank account!"
Bradford says: "That money has to come from somewhere."
Louie says: "Then figure it out."
Louie says: "That is what I pay you to do, right?"
Bradford says: "Hmm, we "are" spending a lot on magical defense on a dark, mysterious island in the Heron Sea."
Louie says: "Great!"
Louie says: "Cut that!"
Owlson says: "There's an emergency on your island in the Heron Sea!"
Louie says: "But, but."
Louie says: "Ugh."
Louie says: "Fine, but when I get back, I am going to live it up!"
Scrooge says: "Ugh, Louie wants to do my job?"
Scrooge says: "Well then, I'll be as lazy as him until he's ready to give my company back."
Scrooge says: "Perhaps a bit of the ol' boob tube will help keep my mind off- Is that my office?"
Randy says: "Yep, nothing like a good, honest, hard day's work."
Randy says: "Work, work, work."
Johnny says: "You know, if I didn't have work, I'd probably waste away into obscurity."
Johnny says: "Yep."
Scrooge says: "Right, I can't just sit here "relaxing."
Scrooge says: "" I'll get started on a new fortune."
Launchpad says: "This is your captain Launchpad speaking."
Launchpad says: "Approaching a mysterious, mist-shrouded island."
Launchpad says: "Should be crashing within the hour."
Louie says: "Thank you, Mannington."
Louie says: "Huh, this page bores me."
Owlson says: "Maybe so we don't die, we can use this time to go over everything we know about this island?"
Louie says: "Hm."
Owlson says: "We know nothing about this island."
Owlson says: "It is so secret that Scrooge had it removed from maps and satellite images."
Louie says: "But-but-but-but-but-but."
Louie says: "Owlson, quit worrying."
Louie says: "There's nothing on this island that I can't handle."
Louie says: "I am the richest duck in the world!"
Louie says: "Woo woo woo!"
Bombie says: "Richest..."
Louie says: "Hm, not really the private, rich-guy island I was hoping for."
Louie says: "Heh, put in a white sand beach over there, private lagoon over here, maybe a water slide, or is that too tacky?"
Louie says: "I'm not sure."
Owlson says: "Why would Scrooge invest so much money in protecting this..."
Owlson says: "creepy pile of pillars?"
Louie says: "That's why!"
Louie says: "He was hiding a secret money bin!"
Della says: "Oof."
Della says: "So, Dewey has his own show?"
Huey says: "Mostly in his mind."
Dewey says: "Now, fresh from being lost in space for a decade, put your flippers or whatever moon people have together for, uh, Della Duck!"
Dewey says: "Mom, can I call you Mom?"
Della says: "I am your mom."
Dewey says: "Great."
Dewey says: "You were stuck on the moon for like a really long time."
Dewey says: "Any funny stories about that?"
Della says: "Oh yeah."
Della says: "In the cruel void of space, it's easy to lose track of time."
Della says: "So one morning, I decided to have a staring contest in the mirror, but I was so desperate for human connection it lasted three weeks."
Della says: "To this day, I can't look in a mirror because I'm afraid I'll see "her"."
Dewey says: "Wow."
Huey says: "This is not how I envisioned first contact with alien life."
Webby says: "Oh don't worry."
Webby says: "If anything goes wrong, I'll send in our animal guest."
Webby says: "Ow!"
Webby says: "No biting!"
Louie says: "Man, I am an even better bajillionaire than I thought."
Louie says: "I bet it's like full of like the best treasure."
Launchpad says: "It must really be something if you had all these doohickeys to keep people out."
Manny says: "Or to keep something in."
Manny says: "Or..."
Manny says: "to..."
Manny says: "keep..."
Manny says: "something..."
Manny says: "in."
Louie says: "Come on, let's get in- My beautiful bin!"
Louie says: "What has happened to you?"
Owlson says: "When you cut the magical defenses, it must have allowed..."
Owlson says: "something..."
Owlson says: "to break through."
Owlson says: "But what?"
Launchpad says: "Let's ask this guy."
Bombie says: "Grrr."
Launchpad says: "Excuse me sir."
Bombie says: "RAARR!"
All says: "Aahhh!"
Louie says: "What..."
Louie says: "was..."
Louie says: "that?"
Owlson says: "Whatever Mr."
Owlson says: "McDuck had trapped in that bin!"
Louie says: "Okay, no problem."
Louie says: "I'm the richest duck in the world."
Louie says: "I got this."
Bombie says: "Richest!"
Louie says: "Excuse me, you are on my property right now, buddy."
Louie says: "You'd better leave before I have you removed."
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Louie says: "Uh, okay I'll give you a million dollars to leave."
Louie says: "Dah and a plane."
Louie says: "Dah, and a horse-thing."
Manny says: "And a what???"
Louie says: "Do something!"
Louie says: "I am too rich to die!"
Launchpad says: "I'll save you, Louie McD!"
Louie says: "Oh no, Launchpad!"
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Louie says: "Oh no, me!"
Louie says: "Oh, nothing stops him!"
Louie says: "Owlson, do something!"
Owlson says: "Oh sure, like they cover "this" in business school!"
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Launchpad says: "Oh hey, guys."
Louie says: "Woo hoo!"
Louie says: "I did it!"
Owlson says: "You did it?"
Louie says: "Yeah."
Louie says: "I'm Launchpad's boss, so basically I did it."
Bombie says: "Rrgh!"
Louie says: "Get to the bin!"
Louie says: "Get to the bin!"
Scrooge says: "Ah!"
Scrooge says: "Back to basics."
Scrooge says: "I'm Scrooge McDuck."
Scrooge says: "I'll earn that fortune back in no time."
Scrooge says: "Can I offer a shoeshine, sir?"
Scrooge says: "Glasgow shine?"
Scrooge says: "Shoes so bright you can see your future in them?"
Scrooge says: "Guh, How about now?"
Scrooge says: "No matter."
Scrooge says: "Everyone needs a..."
Scrooge says: "shoeshine?"
Dewey says: "And that is how long I think I could hold my breath in space."
Dewey says: "Thank you."
Della says: "That's great, honey."
Della says: "So, uh, can we send my message to the moon, now?"
Dewey says: "Oh my gosh, yeah of course, it's all you."
Della says: "Hello, Penny."
Dewey says: "And Penny is?"
Della says: "Oh, Penumbra?"
Della says: "She's my best friend."
Dewey says: "A moon alien, and an earth duck."
Dewey says: "How did you meet?"
Della says: "Well, funny story."
Della says: "I ended a decades-long war that was her whole reason for existing."
Dewey says: "That must have made her mad."
Della says: "What?"
Della says: "Nah, I mean, sure, everyone started praising me instead of her and..."
Della says: "but she took me in."
Della says: "She playfully tried to kill me a few times."
Dewey says: "But you can't spell frenemy without enemy, right folks?"
Della says: "No, no, she helped me get back home."
Dewey says: "Ugh, maybe she helped you escape the moon to get rid of you, hey?"
Della says: "That..."
Della says: "would explain why she hasn't come, or called back."
Della says: "Maybe we were never friends."
Dewey says: "Mom?"
Huey says: "Quick, send in the raccoon."
Webby says: "Go go go!"
Louie says: "Go go go!"
Owlson says: "Why didn't we run to the plane?!"
Owlson says: "!"
Louie says: "Because..."
Louie says: "I did not think of that."
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Louie says: "Cut funding?"
Louie says: "That's it!"
Louie says: "Team, I have a plan if you're willing to follow me."
Louie says: "What do you say?"
Louie says: "Do you trust the boss?"
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Bombie says: "Huh?"
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Louie says: "Ha ha ha!"
Louie says: "Classic horse dummy fake-out."
Louie says: "Hello, Bradford?"
Louie says: "Cut the funding to the McDuck satellite system immediately."
Louie says: "Yes, I know what I'm doing."
Louie says: "Drop them all on my location."
Louie says: "Now!"
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Louie says: "Now, now, now!"
Louie says: "Drop them all!"
Manny says: "You owe me a head."
Louie says: "And Scrooge thought I couldn't handle being the richest duck in the world, ha ha ha ha."
Louie says: "Mr."
Louie says: "McQuack, take us home."
Louie says: "Let the rich life of Louie Duck begin!"
Louie says: "Ah ha ha!"
Owlson says: "Alright, back to business."
Louie says: "What?"
Louie says: "I just saved our lives back there, and it was very stressful."
Owlson says: "I'll need you in the office at 6:00 am to make up for the day we just lost."
Louie says: "Ahh, I don't have to listen to you, Owlson."
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Louie says: "Ahh!"
Louie says: "What do you want from me?"
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Owlson says: "ENOUGH!"
Louie says: "Huh?"
Bombie says: "Huh?"
Owlson says: "I was at the top of my class at Mouseton."
Owlson says: "Ran several successful businesses."
Owlson says: "But none of that prepared me for you Duckberg billionaires."
Owlson says: "Reckless thrill-seekers, madmen with the minds of children, actual children!"
Owlson says: "I tried to keep you people humble, but all you care about is money, and power."
Owlson says: "Well, I'm done trying to make you better."
Owlson says: "I'm going to become a better billionaire myself."
Owlson says: "I quit!"
Owlson says: "Consider this my two weeks notice because, I will stay on to train my replacement like a professional!"
Owlson says: "Now, everyone hold on to something!"
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Louie says: "Uh, ahh!"
Owlson says: "Launchpad!"
Owlson says: "Pull up!"
Louie says: "Ah ha!"
Louie says: "Oof!"
Louie says: "Ahh!!"
Owlson says: "No no no no!"
Louie says: "Huh, best hundred million I ever spent."
Louie says: "Huh?"
Louie says: "Oh, come on!"
Gavin says: "So there I was at the front of the line, but after waiting a whole minute and a half, I find out that Trader Sam's has a dress code, so now I have to find some threads."
Scrooge says: "Heh, that will be ten cents, good sir."
Gavin says: "Ooh, uh, sorry."
Gavin says: "Heh."
Gavin says: "Looks like the guy I stole this suit from doesn't carry cash."
Gavin says: "Okay, Gavin out!"
Scrooge says: "Hey!"
Scrooge says: "Ow, Ow."
Scrooge says: "Get back here!"
Scrooge says: "Ugh, building a fortune is a lot harder than I remember."
Louie says: "Help!"
Louie says: "Uncle Scrooge!"
Scrooge says: "Louie?"
Bombie says: "Richest!"
Scrooge says: "Augh!"
Scrooge says: "Him again?"
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Louie says: "Aaahh!"
Scrooge says: "Yahh!"
Louie says: "What is that thing?"
Scrooge says: "The Bombie!"
Louie says: "That explains nothing?"
Scrooge says: "The Bombie is a curse upon whoever is the richest duck in the world."
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Louie says: "Feels like something you should have told me this morning."
Scrooge says: "I didn't think you'd shut down his magical prison on your first day!"
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Louie says: "Well, how do I stop it?"
Scrooge says: "You can't!"
Scrooge says: "He cannot be bought."
Scrooge says: "He cannot be fought."
Scrooge says: "Though riches you've got, your life will be fraught, until you have earned the one thing you have not."
Louie says: "But I'm the richest duck in the world!"
Louie says: "I have everything!"
Scrooge says: "That's what I said."
Scrooge says: "I tried everything."
Scrooge says: "Nothing worked."
Scrooge says: "I barely managed to contain him on Falcon Island."
Bombie says: "Hah!"
Bombie says: "Huh?"
Louie says: "If you couldn't beat the curse, how am I supposed to do it?"
Scrooge says: "Louie, just give the money back."
Scrooge says: "Let me take back the curse."
Louie says: "But then he'll come after you."
Scrooge says: "I'll figure out how to beat him."
Scrooge says: "I'm Scrooge McDuck."
Scrooge says: "Huh?"
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Scrooge says: "Run, Louie!"
Louie says: "Gah!"
Bombie chases down Louie who tries to enter a building before opening hours says: "Louie: No no no no!"
Bombie chases down Louie who tries to enter a building before opening hours says: "What?"
Bombie chases down Louie who tries to enter a building before opening hours says: "Ah rude!"
Bombie causes a billboard of Louie Duck to fall closing off Louie's escape.
Louie says: "What?"
Louie says: "Please, stop!"
Louie says: "I can't do this."
Louie says: "I shouldn't even be the richest duck in the world!"
Bombie hesitates says: "Louie: I'm not ready to be a businessman."
Bombie hesitates says: "Owlson was right."
Bombie hesitates says: "That's the thing the richest duck in the world needs to earn."
Bombie hesitates says: "humility."
Bombie hesitates says: "Being able to admit that you can't do something."
Scrooge says: "Sentimental hogwash!"
Bombie says: "Arrgh!"
Scrooge says: "Fair point."
Scrooge says: "What now?"
Louie says: "Been walking a long way?"
Louie says: "Sorry about that."
Louie says: "This curse affects us both, huh?"
Scrooge says: "Good thinking, lad."
Louie says: "Uncle Scrooge, you can have your fortune back."
Louie says: "I am not cut out to be the richest duck in the world."
Scrooge says: "Of course not."
Scrooge says: "Not yet, anyway."
Scrooge says: "But Louie, you were a better billionaire than I was today in every sense of the word."
Bombie heads back to his home.
Louie says: "So, you're not super mad at me?"
Scrooge says: "Lad, if this is the worst damage you did as the richest duck in the world, then everything is fine."
Dewey says: "Hey Mom?"
Dewey says: "I'm sorry about..."
Dewey says: "all that back there."
Dewey says: "I'm sure Penumbra is just caught up with moon stuff."
Della says: "Ugh, don't sweat it, kid."
Della says: "Who needs moon friends when you got your family?"
Penumbra says: "This is Lieutenant Penumbra for her friend, Della Duck."
Della says: "Hah!"
Della says: "I knew she was my friend!"
Della says: "Take that, family!"
Penumbra says: "All of your defense satellites just went down for some reason."
Penumbra says: "Lunaris is bringing an army to destroy Earth!"
Penumbra says: "Della, he's coming for your family."
