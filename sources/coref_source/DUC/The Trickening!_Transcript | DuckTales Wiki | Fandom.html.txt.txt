Webby says: "So says I, Balor, demon king of the evil eye."
Webby says: "The evil eye curse that plagued seventeenth century Europe?"
Dewey says: "Hm?"
Webby says: "The roots of Halloween, a day to disguise yourself to trick the demons or appease them with sweet treat offerings."
Webby says: "A celebration of fear and conquering that fear."
Dewey says: "I'm a pirate on vacation."
Webby says: "You're supposed to blend in with the monsters by wearing scary costumes."
Louie says: "There's nothing scary about tonight."
Huey says: "What are you supposed to be?"
Louie says: ""Nuh, Junior Woodchuck rule nine million, duh."
Louie says: "" Halloween is about candy and only candy."
Huey says: "You are a lazy costumer."
Huey says: "Quit stretching my hat!"
Louie says: "We have the same head!"
Louie says: "Forget the leg work, I've got a plan that'll make us candy billionaires."
Scrooge says: "Uwah!"
Scrooge says: "Leave this house!"
Kids says: "Ahhh!"
opening theme with Halloween variant says: "Scrooge: This house is closed for Halloween."
Della says: "Aw, but we were gonna do a haunted house."
Donald says: "I want to give out candy for trick-or-treaters."
Della says: "And I wanted to scare those trick-or-treaters so that they'd never close their eyes again."
Scrooge says: "Then go bother Launchpad."
Scrooge says: "I'm going guising."
Scrooge says: "Back in Glasgow, this was the one night a year I could eat sweets like a rich man's son."
Scrooge says: "Through sheer hard work, I earned more treats than all the kids in town, and every year I aim to reclaim that glory."
Huey says: "Enough chit-chat."
Huey says: "Move out."
Scrooge says: "Ahem."
Donald says: "But what if kids stop here for candy?"
Scrooge says: "Oh no!"
Scrooge says: "It appears someone has taken all the candy already, but who?"
Scrooge says: "It's a spooky Halloween mystery."
Scrooge says: "Ooh hoo hoo hoo."
Della says: "Phooey!"
Donald says: "Ah, Launchpad's house will be fun."
Della says: "Ew boy, Launchpad's house."
Della says: "Cheesy movies, handing out candy, not terrifying kids..."
Della says: "in a fun way."
Huey says: "First up, Rockerduck Estates for the big bars and candy corn relay."
Huey says: "Then down to Silverbeak for the haunted hayride spooktacular."
Huey says: "And I've scheduled bathroom breaks, so just..."
Huey says: "hold it till we get to Mrs."
Huey says: "Clopax."
Huey says: "Great bathroom, freshly tiled."
Louie says: "Or, we could go to one place, and get all the candy you could ever want."
Dewey says: "We're going to a candy store?"
Louie says: "No, it's night time."
Louie says: "Candy stores are closed."
Dewey says: "We're gonna rob a candy store?"
Louie says: "Buh, no."
Louie says: "We're going..."
Louie says: "to Hazel House, the most haunted house in town."
Donald says: "What the..."
Donald says: "Launchpad?"
Della says: "He couldn't have crashed all of these in one night."
Launchpad says: "Oh, No!"
Launchpad says: "Stay away!"
Della says: "Aahh!"
Donald says: "Aahh!"
Launchpad says: "What?"
Launchpad says: "You two?"
Launchpad says: "Hurry, get in here before the next group arrives."
Della says: "Look at the authenticity, the detail, this will scare any kid."
Della says: "I was wrong."
Della says: "Launchpad is a pro."
Della says: "Tonight's gonna be horrifying."
Louie says: "Ahem, legend says, long ago, the house was hastily built on a gateway between the living and the dead."
Louie says: "Every treater who dares to enter disappears along with their candy..."
Louie says: "candy..."
Louie says: "candy..."
Louie says: "Which means there's years worth of free candy inside."
Dewey says: "Yar, a treasure fit for a relaxed buccaneer."
Louie says: "One last sweet score, and we will never have to trick-or-treat again."
Louie says: "Candy..."
Louie says: "for..."
Louie says: "life."
Huey says: "Nice story, but I've never even heard of this place."
Huey says: "We want to trick-or-treat, not chase some phony myth from a phony Huey."
Louie says: "If it is just a myth then no harm in getting to the truth."
Louie says: "Junior Woodchuck rule 60-whatever: go- in- that- house- now!"
Webby says: "A chance to test my costume, and mingle with monsters?"
Webby says: "I must go!"
Dewey says: "With my cut, I can finally open that 24-hour candy store I've been dreaming about since ten minutes ago."
Huey says: "Guys, wait!"
Huey says: ""Activate elbow grease."
Huey says: "" Hrnn!"
Huey says: "Ugh!"
Louie tries the door and the knob falls off.
Huey says: "abandoned?"
Louie says: "The bigger the trick, the sweeter the treat."
Louie says: "Trademark Louie Duck- I mean Junior Woodchuck rule 3- uh!"
Huey pushes Louie out of the way and the kids enter the house.
Louie says: "There's candy around here somewhere, keep your eyes peeled."
Louie says: "woo yah!"
Louie says: "There, that door."
Louie says: "come on guys, we have a ghost butler."
Louie says: "We have faced all kinds of monsters."
Louie says: "What's going to scare us here?"
Louie says: "Nothing, so..."
Louie says: "Go for it, Dewey."
Dewey opens the door, takes a deep breath, and goes inside.
Louie says: "No scream, great."
Webby says: "Hyuh!"
Louie says: "Nothing scary in there at..."
Louie says: "all, uh boy."
Louie says: "Focus on what's important."
Louie says: "Let's find candy."
Huey says: "You mean "Let's find Dewey?"
Louie says: "Uh yeah yeah yeah him too."
Louie says: "candy for life."
Huey says: "We should be at Miss Swineson's bobbing for apples."
Huey says: "You know, fun times, not grim, traumatizing times."
Dewey says: "Over here, guys."
Webby says: "Dewey?"
Dewey says: "I found it, the mother-lode."
Dewey says: "It's all here."
Louie says: "Dewey?"
Louie says: "What are you doing?"
Dewey says: "Nothing."
Kids says: "Aahh!"
Dewey says: "Why?"
Dewey says: "What are you doing?"
Huey says: "If you're here, who's that?"
Dewey puppet says: "No..."
Dewey puppet says: "escape."
Kids says: "Aahh!"
Kids says: "Aahh!"

Kids says: "Aahh!"
puppets says: "Ha ha ha ha!"
puppets says: "Ha ha ha ha!"
Kids says: "Aahh!"
Louie says: "Candy for life, Candy for life, Candy for life."
Dewey puppet says: "Candy for death!"
Louie says: "Don't you turn my motto back on me!"
Della says: "So what kind of haunted house we running?"
Della says: "Gas station of horrors."
Della says: "Years ago, torched in an accident, we are what remains."
Della says: "L."
Della says: "P."
Della says: "is the evil mechanic, I'm your demonic helper, Donald, you're the victim."
Launchpad says: "Shh."
Launchpad says: "they're coming."
Della says: "Okay, I love the commitment."
Della says: "We'll wing it."
Kids says: "Ah!"
Launchpad says: "Ah-ah!"
Launchpad says: "Back to your sulfur pits, oh demon spawn!"
Kids says: "Aahh!"
Della says: "Uh, boo?"
Donald says: "Happy Halloween!"
Della says: "Okay, L."
Della says: "P."
Della says: "Maybe don't come in so hot next time?"
Launchpad says: "Every year, they come."
Della says: "Uh, yeah."
Della says: "Every October 31st."
Launchpad says: "They come for you too?"
Launchpad says: "No!"
Launchpad says: "No, no, no!"
Launchpad says: "This whole night is my fault."
Donald says: "Uh..."
Della says: "What do you think is going on here?"
Launchpad says: "Come with me, and I'll reveal my tale."
Huey says: "We need to find a way out!"
Louie says: "No, not yet!"
Louie says: "Try all the doors!"
Demonic Clown says: "Argh!"
Dewey says: "Aahh!"
The kids try every door which holds a different monster.
Webby says: "Ah!"
Webby says: "It is I, Balor, the dark lord!"
Webby says: "To attack me, my fiends, is to attack one of your own!"
Monsters says: "Huh?"
Webby says: "Our costumes didn't trick them."
Louie says: "Huh?"
Louie says: "Candy!"
Louie says: "Over there, the last door!"
Louie says: "It can't be any worse than in here!"
Huey says: "Why would you ever say that?"
Launchpad says: "The Hungries, that's what I call them."
Launchpad says: "The soul-sucking ghouls that..."
Launchpad says: "haunt our streets on this night."
Della says: "You mean trick-or-treaters?"
Launchpad says: "It all started long ago."
Launchpad says: "I was out, you know, being a kid."
Launchpad says: "I had some trouble with my trikey."
Launchpad says: "I was totally lost on the wrong side of town, and there was this house."
Launchpad says: "It was old, smelly, but oddly welcoming."
Launchpad says: "I went inside to call for help."
Launchpad says: "I didn't find a phone, but I did find an ancient scroll."
Launchpad says: "The words were strange and unfamiliar."
Launchpad says: "When I read it aloud, everything changed."
Launchpad says: "It was suddenly night time, and pint-sized demons everywhere, every type you could imagine, smiling and laughing."
Launchpad says: "Breaking into people's homes, stealing their souls to put in pillowcases."
Donald says: "No, they're getting candy."
Launchpad says: "Yes, joyful souls are the candy of the beasts."
Launchpad says: "Beasts that I freed onto our world."
Launchpad says: "I've spent every October 31st since hiding out in a bunker."
Della says: "So, to be clear, you think this night is a monster curse that you unleashed on Duckberg as a child?"
Launchpad says: "Yes."
Della says: "Awesome!"
Della says: "I'm In!"
Donald says: "What?!"
Donald says: "!"
Launchpad says: "Uh!"
Launchpad says: "Another Hungrie!"
Della says: "This is perfect!"
Della says: "Real scares!"
Della says: "The kids will think it's real, because Launchpad thinks it's real."
Della says: "A Halloween they'll never forget."
Donald says: "Because they will be traumatized!"
Della says: "Traumatized in the most wholesome way possible!"
Della says: "I love this holiday!"
Donald says: "No!"
Donald says: "I can't let you do it!"
Della says: "But I must!"
Della says: "Urgh!"
Della says: "Quit it!"
Della says: "Quit it!"
Donald says: "Think about the children!"
Della says: "I am!"
Della says: "I want to scare them!"
Donald says: "Uh!"
Scrooge says: "Trick or treat!"
Launchpad says: "Go away!"
Scrooge says: "I said trick or treat!"
Launchpad says: "Neither!"
Scrooge says: "Candy hoarder, eh?"
Scrooge says: "You won't stop the Guileful Guiser of Glasgow."
Launchpad says: "They're breaking in!"
Launchpad says: "They're getting even bolder!"
Launchpad says: "I won't let you hurt my friends!"
Launchpad says: "Ah!"
Launchpad says: "Aahh!!"
Scrooge says: "Ugh!"
Huey says: "Okay, we made it through the house, and with enough time to get to Mr."
Louie says: "But, the legend."
Louie says: "Where was the candy stash?"
Louie says: "I've gotta go back in."
Huey says: ""Halt, citizen."
Huey says: "" Let's forget about this half-baked scheme."
Huey says: "If we leave now, we can still pick up the back half of the trick-or-treat trail."
Louie says: "Last time I checked, we were a family of treasure-seeking adventurers."
Louie says: "Why stop now?"
Louie says: "Cause this house isn't on your precious map?"
Louie says: "Well, I'm putting it on there."
Louie says: "Give it to me!"
Huey says: "Hyah!"
Louie says: "Hey, "Hazel House, fabled candy fortune here."
Louie says: "Stay away."
Louie says: "" You knew about this?"
Huey says: "No!"
Huey says: "Okay, fine, yes."
Louie says: "You told us it was fake!"
Louie says: "You tried to get us to avoid it!"
Louie says: "What, were you planning on hoarding all the candy for yourself?"
Huey says: "It's not like that, I swear."
Louie says: "You always do this, with the lists and the schedules."
Dewey says: "Ah!"
Huey says: "Do what?"
Huey says: "trying to keep us on track?"
Huey says: "I just wanted to have a traditional Halloween."
Webby says: "Hey, hey, Let's not spoil tonight."
Dewey says: "Ahoy?"
Dewey says: "Starboard side?"
Kids says: "Huh?"
Dewey says: "Sorry, I mean port side?"
Well woman says: "No..."
Well woman says: "escape..."
Kids says: "Ahh!"
Demonic Clown says: "Ha ha ha ha!"
Kids says: "Aahh!"
Puppet master says: "Ha ha ha!"
Kids says: "Aahh!"
Demonic Clown says: "Ha ha ha ha!"
Webby says: "We need to appease them."
Webby says: "It's tradition."
Huey says: "There's nothing to appease them with, cause we followed Louie's dumb plan!"
Huey says: "None of us have candy!"
Well woman says: "No candy?"
Demonic Clown says: "What do you mean, no candy?"
Well womam says: "Back to one, everybody."
Puppet master says: "On to the next."
Puppet master says: "I'll be in my coffin."
Launchpad says: "Aah!"
Scrooge says: "What the..."
Launchpad says: "Ugh!"
Scrooge says: "Gah!"
Scrooge says: "The spoils!"
Launchpad says: "Ugh!"
Launchpad says: "Ugh!"
Scrooge says: "Ah!"
Scrooge says: "Let me out of here!"
Scrooge says: "Ugh!"
Scrooge says: "Ow!"
Scrooge says: "Ugh, oooohh..."
Launchpad says: "It won't ever stop."
Launchpad says: "They'll just keep coming for me."
Launchpad says: "For my family."
Launchpad says: "I started this, now it's time I finish it."
Launchpad says: "I need to go back to where it all began."
Della says: "Ugh, come on, Donald, a little scare never hurt anyone!"
Kids says: "Aahh!!"
Launchpad says: "I'll end this, even if I have to take all these tiny demons out one by one!"
Della says: "Oh no, he's going to hurt everyone!"
Della says: "Now is not the time to decide who was wrong about what."
Della says: "We've gotta stop him!"
Scrooge says: "Hah!"
Frankenstein says: "Ngh!"
Frankenstein says: "Ungh!"
Louie says: "Gross."
Webby says: "Actual monsters?"
Webby says: "Then surely you must recognize Balor, the demon king."
Webby says: "Lord of blight and smite."
Wereduck says: "Hm, pirate on vacation?"
Dewey says: "Arr."
Wereduck says: "Nice."
Huey says: "Who are you people?"
Louie says: "More importantly, where are you hiding the candy?!"
Louie says: "!"
Witch Hazel says: "You brats are supposed to bring the offering."
Witch Hazel says: "Candy's the only good reason to celebrate this holiday that is, frankly, pretty offensive to monsters."
Nosferatu says: "So for centuries, we tricked kids into coming here for scares so terrifying they drop their sweets."
Dewey says: "So you're like, candy thieves?"
Nosferatu says: "Hey!"
Nosferatu says: "Can't go out in the daylight."
Nosferatu says: "Not like there's some 24-hour candy story somewhere."
Dewey says: "That's what I've been saying!"
Webby says: "Monsters?"
Webby says: "Treats?"
Webby says: "Appeasements?"
Webby says: "The legends are true!"
Webby says: "Kinda."
Huey says: "But why the extra costumes?"
Huey says: "You're already monsters."
Wereduck says: "Kids today don't appreciate the classics."
Wereduck says: "You're scared of like random kid stuff."
Wereduck says: "Puppets, clowns, little girls in wells."
Wereduck says: "What is wrong with you guys?"
Witch Hazel says: "Ah, who cares?"
Witch Hazel says: "It's midnight."
Witch Hazel says: "Trick-or-treating's over, and we wasted the night on these candiless fleshbags."
Huey says: "I missed it."
Huey says: "I missed Halloween."
Louie says: "Huey?"
Louie says: "So we made a mistake."
Louie says: "At least we're still alive."
Louie says: "We met some real-life monsters."
Louie says: "That's a..."
Louie says: "that's a cool thing, right?"
Huey says: "Back on the houseboat, Halloween was our biggest adventure every year."
Huey says: "We'd suit up, face the unknown, search for the best candy."
Huey says: "Sure, it was just neighborhood trick-or-treating, but it was ours."
Louie says: "I was just trying to get us a lifetime supply of candy, and..."
Louie says: "that is the problem."
Huey says: "I don't want this to be our last Halloween."
Louie says: "Junior Woodchuck Rule 99: who cares about the candy?"
Frankenstein says: "We do!"
Frankenstein says: "Rrgh!"
Louie says: "Aahh!"
Huey says: "Aahh!"
Nosferatu says: "We monsters need our sweets."
Nosferatu says: "Our appeasements."
Wereduck says: "No more  tricks."
Witch Hazel says: "You owe us treats, and we don't scare so easy."
Dewey says: "Uh, Webby, what happened when the Celtics ran out of treats to appease the demons with?"
Webby says: "Usually they fed on children!"
Webby says: "Oh dear."
Dewey says: "Ah!"
Dewey says: "another one!"
Nosferatu says: "That's not one of ours."
Launchpad says: "This ends now, demons."
Launchpad says: "Aahh!!!"
Nosferatu says: "Aahh!"
Launchpad says: "Monsters!"
Launchpad says: "Uh uh, ooh!"
Witch Hazel says: "Ahh!"
Witch Hazel says: "RUN FOR IT!!"
Della says: "Launchpad?"
Wereduck says: "Agh!"
Wereduck says: "Creepy twins!"
Donald says: "Hey!"
Donald says: "Have you seen our friend, Launchpad?"
Wereduck says: "What is that horrible garbled moaning?"
Wereduck says: "He's possessed."
Donald says: "Oh, hey Launchpad."
Launchpad says: "Ugh!"
Launchpad says: "Ugh!"
Launchpad says: "What have you done to Dewey?!"
Launchpad says: "!"
Monsters says: "Uh oh!"
Scrooge says: "Trick..."
Scrooge says: "or..."
Scrooge says: "treat!"
Monsters says: "Ah!"
Della says: "Easy, Launchpad."
Della says: "You have it all wrong!"
Launchpad says: "Ahh!!"
Scrooge says: "Uagh!"
Launchpad says: "The sacred text."
Launchpad says: "Monosodium glutamate, sucralose, polysorbate, blue 52..."
Donald says: "Uh."
Launchpad says: "Fructose, corn syrup, artificial flavoring!"
Scrooge says: "Kids?"
Scrooge says: "What in Samhain is happening here?"
Witch Hazel says: "That was terrifying!"
Witch Hazel says: "Bravo, you black-hearted devil!"
Witch Hazel says: "Ha ha ha!"
Nosferatu says: "I haven't felt so undead in centuries."
Launchpad says: "Uh."
Frankenstein says: "We..."
Frankenstein says: "learn..."
Frankenstein says: "from you."
Wereduck says: "Evil mechanic is the real master of Halloween."
Launchpad says: "Hallow-what?"
Launchpad says: "I read the scroll!"
Launchpad says: "How are you still here?!"
Launchpad says: "!"
Della says: "Yeah, he doesn't know what Halloween is."
Louie says: "Well, Gizmo-dork, shall we show him?"
Huey says: "There is one house that I know hasn't given out any treats yet."
Launchpad says: "So you're saying tonight's a holiday where you dress up in a fun costume and then go door-to-door with your friends, and get free candy?"
Louie says: "Yes, Launchpad."
Louie says: "This is Halloween."
Kid 1.
Whoa, that costume is sick!
Kid 2.
That's so cool!
Wereduck says: "You heard?"
Wereduck says: "Old Man McDuck's giving away full candy bars!"
Webby says: "Wow, Uncle Scrooge."
Webby says: "Finally opening up your gates for Halloween, feeling the true spirit of the holiday."
Webby says: "You're charging them admission, aren't you?"
Scrooge says: "And, we're open all night."
Scrooge says: "Dewey's idea."
Dewey says: "An all-night candy store."
Dewey says: "Yar!"
Dewey says: "It be a Halloween miracle!"
Webby says: "Spirit appeased!"
Launchpad says: "I love Hallowoon!"
Huey says: "Close enough, pal."
Huey says: "Close enough."
