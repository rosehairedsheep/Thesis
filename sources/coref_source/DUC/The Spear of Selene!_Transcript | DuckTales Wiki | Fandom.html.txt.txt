Thunder crashes. All Scream- oh! Thunder crashes again.
Launchpad says: "Aw, come on, a little lightning never killed anyone."
All Gasp. More lightning and thunder .
Launchpad says: "See?"
Launchpad says: "Nothin' to worry about!"
Dewey clicks some buttons and turns a dial.
Webby says: "What about that flashing red light?"
Launchpad says: "Huh?"
Launchpad says: "That's just probably the "everything is fine" light."
Dewey says: "Okay, but hypothetically, what if it's not the "everything is not fine" light?"
Launchpad says: "Oh, no!"
Screaming as the Sunchaser falls through the sky before crashing, The storm clears and a Lion/ scorpion creature roars.
Louie says: "Where are we?"
Huey says: "According to the JWG, we're off the tip of Greece, and-wait."
Huey says: "This can't be right."
Huey says: "I thought it was a myth."
What? What is this place?
Scrooge says: "Ithaquack."
Donald says: "What?!"
Donald says: "!"
All says: "It's gorgeous!"
All says: ", Gasping, Look at that!"
All says: "No."
Donald says: "No, no, no, no."
Donald says: "We gotta go now!"
Scrooge says: "Get this plane in the air!"
Launchpad says: "Sorry, Mr."
Launchpad says: "McDee, gotta figure out what this flashing light means."
Launchpad says: "I always say, better safe than whatever the opposite of safe is."
Launchpad says: "Yeah."
Launchpad says: "I do say that."
Scrooge says: "When have you ever said that?!"
Scrooge says: "!"
Webby says: "Hmm."
Webby says: "Might as well take a look around."
Cheering.
Donald says: "No, get back here!"
Scrooge says: "Everyone stay on the plane!"
See ya!
Bye-Bye says: "Webby: We're here!"
Bye-Bye says: "We did it!"
Dewey says: "Yeah!"
Dewey says: "Wait, why did we do that?"
Webby says: "Dewey, this is Ithaquack."
Dewey says: "I'm sorry?"
Webby says: "Home of legendary Greek artifacts?"
Dewey says: "Oh, Greek What, what, what?"
Webby says: "Like the Spear of Selene!"
Dewey says: "Selene!"
Dewey says: "I knew it!"
Dewey says: "My mom's note to Scrooge said she took the Spear of Selene."
Dewey says: "If we can find the spear,..."
Webby says: "Maybe we'll find out what happened to her and uncover Scrooge's greatest mystery!"
Webby says: "To the naos!"
Webby says: "That's Greek for temple."
Dewey says: "Okay, stop assuming I know things."
Dewey says: "Like, baseline, assume I know nothing."
Theme Song Plays.
Louie says: "You're in my light!"
Donald says: "No, we have to get back to the plane."
You don't know what's out there.
Loie says: "What could be dangerous about a beautiful Grecian vacation island?"
Storkules says: "Hmm!"
Storkules says: "Ha-ha!"
Storkules says: "Hyah!"
Storkules says: "Ha-ha!"
Storkules says: "Huzzah!"
Storkules says: "Kyah!"
Storkules says: "Oh, glorious day!"
Storkules says: "May the fates sing of your return, friend Donald, sailor of the seven seas!"
Donald says: "Hiya, buddy."
Storkules says: "Be these colorful creatures your kin?"
Storkules says: "By Hephaestus's Hammer, half-grown heroes in the making!"
Louie says: "Um, who are you?"
Storkules says: "Your uncle must've told tales of Storkules!"
Storkules says: "Colossus of Corinth, hero of Heliopolis, and, my proudest accomplishment, best friend to Donald Duck!"
Huey says: "The Storkules, a Greek legend, is your best friend?!"
Huey says: "!"
Donald says: "Uh, more like an acquaintance."
Storkules says: "Ha-ha!"
Storkules says: "Thine tongue be as quick and mighty as, well, me."
Scrooge says: "Donald!"
Scrooge says: "Get the boys on board!"
Scrooge says: "We can't let him know we're here."
Louie says: "Can't let who know we're here?"
Zeus says: "Scrooge McDuck!"
Zeus says: "You dare defy the will of Zeus?"
Huey says: "The king of the gods?!"
Huey says: "!"
Huey says: "Get out!"
Huey says: "So many questions."
Huey says: "Do you control all storms, or just lightning?"
Huey says: "Does being immortal also make you impervious to pain?"
Huey says: "Do you cry?"
Louie says: "You know where I can find a good gyro?"
Louie says: "Always ask the locals."
Huey says: "The myths are real!"
Huey says: "This place is amazing!"
Zeus says: "It used to be amazing, until Scrooge and his mortal riff-raff showed up and ruined it."
Louie says: "What?!"
Louie says: "!"
What?!
Webby says: ""Dear Scrooge, I've taken the Spear of Selene."
Webby says: "I'm sorry."
Webby says: "Della."
Webby says: "" We're close to the truth."
Webby says: "I can feel it."
Dewey says: "What if my mom explored this very path?"
Dewey says: "What if I'm literally walking in her footsteps right now?"
Dewey says: "I can still smell her feet."
Webby says: "So we know Della took the Spear of Selene and betrayed Mr."
Webby says: "McDuck and Donald."
Dewey says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Dewey says: "We don't know she did something bad."
Dewey says: "That note can mean lots of things."
Dewey says: ""I've taken the Spear of Selene to get cleaned."
Dewey says: "I'm sorry I spilled soup on it."
Dewey says: "" "I've taken the Spear of Selene back to the store."
Dewey says: "I'm sorry you already had one."
Dewey says: ""Happy Birthday!"
Webby says: "Oh!"
Webby says: "Or "I've taken the Spear of Selene from your money bin", I'm sorry I betrayed your trust."
Webby says: ""  Or or probably one of your things."
Webby says: "Heh."
Webby says: "The only way to know for sure is in the Temple of Heroes!"
Dewey says: ""Of Heroes"?"
Dewey says: "Aha!"
Dewey says: "Pretty good sign my mom wasn't a traitor."
Zeus says: "Ithaquack was the secret vacation spot for gods and heroes."
Zeus says: "And I was the god of hospitality."
Zeus says: "The King of the Beach!"
Zeus says: "Everyone loved me."
Zeus says: "Then, Scrooge showed up, defeated the unkillable Gorgon, found the lost treasure of Troy, was really good at building sand castles."
Zeus says: "Bah!"
Louie says: "Seems pretty fun."
Storkules says: "T'was."
Zeus says: "No, it t'wasn't!"
Zeus says: "Scrooge showed up like he was so cool and ruined it!"
Scrooge says: "Och, Jings."
Scrooge says: "Leave it to an immortal to whine about the good old days."
Scrooge says: "So, where is everyone?"
Zeus says: "They all left when you did."
Zeus says: "Said they didn't want to party with a "lame god" who couldn't even best a lowly mortal."
Scrooge holds up a pot with a picture of Zeus striking ducks with lightning.
Zeus says: "There may have also been a year-long lightning storm."
Storkules says: "But now that you have returned, Storkules, noble Donald, and his fiery sister..."
Storkules says: "What?!"
Storkules says: "!"
Storkules says: "Where is Della?"
Storkules says: "I see."
Then we shall embark upon a rousing adventure to honor our fallen compatriot!
Donald says: "I don't adventure anymore."
Storkules says: "What?!"
Storkules says: "!"
Storkules says: "But adventure is the very blood in your veins!"
Storkules says: "Well, we must at least hold a feast to celebrate your return!"
Louie and Huey cheer.
Zeus says: "What?!"
Scrooge says: "What?!"
Zeus says: "!"
Scrooge says: "!"
Storkules says: "Father, surely the god of hospitality would not cast out a crew of weary travelers."
Zeus says: "Well, no, I guess not."
Storkules says: "Ha-ha!"
Storkules says: "It shall be a bacchanal for the ages!"
Storkules says: "Beach party!"
Soft harp music is played, Storkules blows making toot noises.
Louie says: "Mmm!"
Louie says: "These are the best grapes ever!"
Scrooge says: "A little salty."
Zeus says: "Dip not good enough for you, mortal?!"
Zeus says: "!"
Zeus says: "You offend Olympus!"
Scrooge says: "Maybe people didn't leave because they liked me, but because they didn't like you."
Storkules says: "Ha-ha!"
Storkules says: "Perhaps some festive beach games will lighten the mood."
Zeus says: "Yes!"
Zeus says: "A contest!"
Zeus says: "Your family versus mine in a series of heroic trials."
Yea, all will know that we are the superior party hounds and return to the island!
Scrooge says: "This is exactly why we stopped vacationing here."
Huey says: "But guys, epic trials!"
Huey says: "Zeus!"
Louie says: "Delicious grapes!"
Zeus says: "You're not going anywhere."
Louie says: "Whoo!"
Whoo!
Donald says: "Aw, phooey."
Aw, phooey.
Webby says: "Careful!"
Webby says: "According to legend, the artifact in this chamber holds a terrible curse when removed from its pedestal."
Dewey says: "Of course!"
Dewey says: "Scrooge must have been cursed by the Spear!"
Dewey says: ""I'm taking the Spear of Selene to de-cursify you."
I'm sorry I probably won't survive.
Webby says: "This place is filled with booby traps."
Webby says: "We have to be careful."
Dewey says: "If my mom can make it across, so can I!"
Webby says: "It's okay."
Webby says: "Shh."
It's okay.
We only have to do that one more time to get out.
Dewey says: "It was all worth it to find the Sword of Selene!"
Dewey says: "Wait, what?"
Dewey says: "This isn't what we're looking for."
Dewey says: "Where's the Spear?"
Webby says: "It's a big temple."
Webby says: "We must have the wrong antechamber."
Dewey says: "Then, we'll just have to find the right one."
Dewey says: "Nothing will stand in our way!"
Webby says: "The curse!"
Webby says: "Put it back!"
Webby says: "Put it back!"
Louie says: "I love these tunics."
Louie says: "So breezy, so comfortable."
Huey says: "And surprisingly slimming."
Scrooge says: "Storkules may have brute strength, but he's also an idiot."
Scrooge says: "You lads can use that to your advantage."
Scrooge says: "I believe in you all!"
Zeus says: "Okay, son."
Zeus says: "If you beat Scrooge's family, I'll be back on top."
Zeus says: "Admired, respected, blindly obeyed!"
Storkules says: "And why do you not compete directly against Scrooge?"
Zeus says: "Well, obviously, people would lose respect for me if I were to lower myself to his level."
Zeus says: "Never mind that."
Zeus says: "To your positions!"
Zeus says: "Whoever claims Aeolus's Bag of Winds first, wins."
Zeus says: "Understood?"
Huey says: "Five or six questions."
Zeus says: "On your mark, get set."
Louie says: "We're never gonna beat him like this!"
Louie says: "Ah!"
Louie says: "Too breezy!"
Louie says: "Too breezy!"
Huey says: "Idea!"
Storkules says: "Ha-ha-ha!"
Storkules says: "Well done, nephews of Donald!"
Storkules says: "What ingenuity!"
Storkules says: "From henceforth, you shall be known as Hubert, Tamer of Winds, and Llewelyn, Fighter of Storms!"
Huey says: "Awesome!"
Louie says: "Please do not say my real name out loud."
Scrooge says: "Heh, heh."
Scrooge says: "Satisfied?"
Zeus says: "Doesn't count!"
Zeus says: "They cheated!"
Zeus says: "Best two out of three!"
Dewey says: "Ha-ha!"
Dewey says: ""Scrooge, I'm taking the Spear of Selene to challenge the gods of Olympus, but will probably be eaten by a sea monster."
Dewey says: "I'm sorry, Della."
Webby says: "That's a possibility."
Dewey says: "You hideous monster!"
Dewey says: "I will avenge my mother by killing you with the very spear you're sworn to protect!"
Monster says: "You shall never have the Spear of Poseidon!"
Dewey says: "I'm sorry."
Dewey says: "The Spear of who, now?"
Monster says: "The Spear of Poseidon!"
Dewey says: "Man!"
Dewey says: "We got the wrong chamber again!"
Webby says: "We're looking for the Spear of Selene."
Monster says: "Oh!"
Monster says: "Huh."
Monster says: "You're gonna want to go back down the hall, past the Harpy Aviary, third door on your left."
Monster says: "Garden of Selene!"
Monster says: "Can't miss it."
Webby says: "Oh, hey, thanks."
Dewey says: "Sorry about calling you a hideous monster before."
Dewey says: "I'm sure you're very attractive by sea monster standards."
Monster says: "Not really."
Monster says: "Thanks, though."
Switches to Donald, Louie, and Huey about to throw discs.
Louie says: "Grunt: Grunt: Storkules: Yahh!"
Louie says: "Ha-ha!"
Louie says: "Huzzah!"
Zeus says: "Grrrrrrrr!"
Horses says: "Whine: Donald: Ahhhhhhh!"
Storkules says: "Huey: Louie: Ha-ha!"
Whoo!
Whoo!
Zeus says: "Groans."
Zeus says: "Hmmmm."
Zeus says: "Hmmm?"
Zeus says: "Enough!"
Zeus says: "Now comes the ultimate challenge."
Steal the golden fleece from this small child.
Scrooge says: "This is your ultimate challenge?"
Louie says: "There's no way we're gonna beat Storkules on this one."
Storkules says: "Steal?"
Storkules says: "From a child?"
Storkules says: "But if I were to do such a thing, could I ever truly be called a hero?"
Storkules says: "Donald, I am in need of your wise counsel."
Donald? Donald! Oh! Companion Donald, where are you going?
Donald says: "Ah, look."
Donald says: "You're a nice guy, but..."
Storkules says: "The most nice guy, for I am Storkules, pure of..."
Donald says: "No, no, no!"
Donald says: "I'm through with adventure!"
Donald says: "Someone always gets hurt!"
Storkules says: "But getting hurt is part of the adventure!"
Storkules says: "What would fierce Della say if she could hear you now?"
Donald says: "Well, she can't!"
Donald says: "Ahh."
Donald says: "Someone always gets hurt."
Webby says: "A perfect 1:125th scale replica of Ithaquack."
Webby says: "And look!"
Webby says: "There's a tiny chimera on the hillside!"
Webby says: "It's so adorable, I just want to slay it!"
Dewey says: "Focus."
We're so close to solving this.
The truth about my mom.
Webby says: "And one of the greatest mysteries of Clan McDuck."
Dewey says: "So, do we look in the tiny houses, or..."
Dewey says: "?"
A Stone moves and an entrance to the Garden of Salene is revealed.
Dewey says: "The Garden of Selene!"
Dewey says: "What's it say?"
Dewey says: "That Della Duck was a hero who died nobly trying to protect her family?"
Webby says: ""Whomsoever claims the prize inside shall find great riches, but incur the terrible wrath of the gods."
Webby says: ""  It all checks out!"
Webby says: "Della stole the spear, angered the gods, and brought their wrath down upon her innocent family, which explains why Mr."
Webby says: "McDuck and Donald didn't want to land here."
Dewey says: "Ha!"
Dewey says: "That can't be true."
My mom would never do that to her family.
Webby says: "I guess we'll find out for sure in the garden."
Let's go!
Dewey says: "No."
Webby says: "What are you doing?!"
Webby says: "!"
Webby says: "The door is closing!"
Dewey says: "We're not going in."
Webby says: "But all the answers we've been searching for are in there!"
Dewey says: "I don't care!"
Dewey says: "My mom was a hero!"
Dewey pushes Webby away, Webby flips landing at the bottom of the Itaquack replica.
Storkules says: "If I do not steal the fleece, Father shall be incensed, but if I steal from a small, innocent child, how can I ever face myself again?"
Zeus says: "Just grab it already!!!"
Louie says: "I got it!"
Huey says: "Louie!"
Louie says: "What?"
Louie says: "I'm also a little kid."
Louie says: "It's fine."
Scrooge says: "Plug your ears!"
Scrooge says: "No good ever came from a creepy child singing!"
Zeus says: "Oh!"
Zeus says: "The child is actually a mind-controlling siren!"
Zeus says: "Did I not mention that?"
Zeus says: "Storkules, finish them!"
Huey says: "Uh-oh!"
Dewey says: "Ahh!"
Aah!
Weeby says: "Please!"
Weeby says: "The answers are right through there!"
Weeby says: "You can't stop me now!"
Dewey says: "Don't have to."
Just have to hold you off until the door closes!
Webby says: "You wouldn't!"
Webby says: "I'll save you, tiny chimera!"
Storkules says: "No!"
Storkules says: "My fists betray my heart!"
Storkules says: "Fathe, stop this madness!"
Zeus says: "Mm-hmm?"
Scrooge says: "Zeus, lay off, man!"
Scrooge says: "It's not my fault I best you at pretty much everything I do!"
Huey says: "Not helping!"
Donald says: "Let me through, you no-good!"
Donald says: "Aaaah!"
Donald says: "Never aaah!"
Donald says: "Adventure ow!"
Donald says: "Again!"
Donald says: "Aaah!"
Louie says: "Help!"
Help!
Donald says: "Boys?!"
Donald says: "!"
Storkules says: "I must apologize in advance for crushing your tiny bodies."
Storkules says: "I want you to know that as my best friend, Donald's family, I consider you my second-tier best friends."
Storkules says: "Farewell."
Donald says: "Hey, you big palooka!"
Donald says: "Nobody gets hurt today!"
Donald says: "I'm gonna get my hands on you!"
Webby says: "We're so close to the truth!"
Webby says: "Why won't you let us find it?!"
Webby says: "!"
Dewey says: "Because what if my mom was a bad person?"
Webby says: "Okay."
Dewey says: "What?"
Webby says: "This is one mystery we don't have to solve."
Dewey says: "Hmm."
Dewey says: "I need to know the truth, whatever it is."
Webby says: "Aaah!"
Aaah!
Selene says: "Ha!"
Selene says: "Gotcha!"
Selene says: "Heeeey, you're not Della."
Dewey says: "You know Della?"
Dewey says: "Where is she?"
Dewey says: "Please tell me she wasn't an evil family betrayer and spear stealer!"
Dewey says: "Who are you, anyway?"
Webby says: "Dewey, that's Selene, the goddess of the moon."
Hi, I'm Webby.
Selene says: "I heard Scrooge and his family were on the island, so I wrote a super-spooky prophecy on the door to lure my friend, Della."
It usually does the trick.
Dewey says: "So, where's the Spear of Selene, Selene?"
Selene says: "What spear?"
Dewey says: "The one Della took from your garden."
Selene says: "You mean the Sphere of Selene?"
Dewey says: "Why does no one get what I'm saying?!"
Dewey says: "!"
Dewey says: "The Spear of Selene!"
Selene says: "I've never had a spear."
Do you mean the Sword of Selene? That's down the hall.
Dewey says: "No!"
Dewey says: "The Spear of Selene!"
Dewey says: "The one my mom took!"
Dewey says: "The one that's our only clue to finding her!"
Selene says: "Oh, you're Della's kid!"
Selene says: "I should've realized."
Selene says: "You're just like her."
I'm sorry.
I haven't seen her in years, and I don't know what the Spear of Selene is.
Dewey says: "So, we're back to "she stole Scrooge's spear and betrayed the family" then."
Dewey says: "Great."
Selene says: "What?"
Selene says: "No way!"
Selene says: "She loved her family more than anything in the world."
Della wasn't just a good person, she was the greatest.
And she made everyone around her better.
Webby says: "Maybe the spear isn't an artifact."
Maybe it's something else!
Selene says: "Your mom did love a good mystery."
Selene says: "Here."
Selene says: "It's not a spear, but it is a treasure even Della never found."
Selene says: "Don't give up, young duck."
Selene says: "Your mother never did."
Dewey puts down the sphere and hugs Selene, Webby stands there until Dewey pulls her into the hug as well.
Webby says: "Mmm."
Mmm.
Storkules says: "Know that I regret this most bitterly."
Scrooge says: "Seems like old times, eh, lad?"
Donald says: "Yeah!"
Huey says: "We gotta stop the singing!"
Louie says: "I'm on it."
Louie says: "What a magical voice!"
Louie says: "Do you have any idea how much money I could make on a voice like yours?"
Louie says: "Zeus just wants to use you."
Louie says: "I want to use you to make us both rich."
Louie says: "What do you say?"
Siren Child says: "You've got a deal."
Louie says: "Great."
Scrooge and Donald grunting.
Storkules says: "Huh?"
Storkules says: "Donald!"
Storkules says: "You have saved me!"
Storkules says: "Oh-ho-ho!"
Storkules says: "Come here."
Zeus says: "Don't hug the enemy!"
Zeus says: "What are you doing?!"
Zeus says: "!"
Scrooge says: "They're best friends."
Donald says: "Acquaintances!"
Scrooge says: "Perhaps we've been letting our pride get in the way for decades and it's our families who suffer."
Scrooge says: "What do you say?"
Scrooge says: "Peace?"
Scrooge says: "Does beating me really mean that much to you?"
Zeus says: "Yes, absolutely."
Scrooge says: "Oh, fine."
Scrooge says: "One final challenge."
Scrooge says: "Winner gets all the glory."
Scrooge says: "Oh, I oh, I cannot believe I choked on the last round."
Zeus says: "Yes!"
Zeus says: "I win!"
Zeus says: "In your face, McDuck!"
Zeus says: "I win, say it out loud I win, you love it, yeah, go, I win!"
Storkules says: "You may think you're done with adventure, but it will never be done with you."
You're a hero, whether you want to be or not.
Donald says: "I do not."
Donald says: "But thanks, friend Storkules."
Storkules says: ": Storkules: He called me his friend!"
Storkules says: "He said it back!"
Storkules says: "Ha-ha!"
Storkules says: "This is the most glorious day of my entire life!"
Scrooge says: "There you two are."
Scrooge says: "Quick, let's get back to the plane before he comes up with another cockamamie contest."
Dewey To Webby.
Thanks for pushing me back there. I promise I'll never stop until we find the truth. With this sphere as my witness, I ohh no!
Zeus says: "No!!!"
Webby says: "The wrath of the gods."
Scrooge says: "We should go now."
Launchpad says: "Okay."
Launchpad says: "I think I found the problem."
