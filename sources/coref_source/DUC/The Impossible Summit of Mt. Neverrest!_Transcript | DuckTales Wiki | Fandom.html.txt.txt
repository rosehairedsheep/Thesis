The episode commences showing the summit of a mountain.
Scrooge says: "Mt."
Scrooge says: "Neverrest, the highest peak in the world."
Scrooge says: "Most prized of the seven summits, Neverrest has claimed the world's finest explorers."
Scrooge says: "It is said to be completely unclimbable, But now that smug stack of stalagmites has to deal with Scrooge McDuck."
Louie says: "Wait, so instead of spending Christmas in a billionaire's mansion waiting for Santa Claus..."
Scrooge says: "That man is not allowed in my home."
Scrooge says: "He knows what he did."
Louie says: "We're following an old man up Mt."
Louie says: "Certain Doom, here?"
Huey says: "Oh, Mt."
Huey says: "Neverrest is three times deadlier than Mt."
Huey says: "Certain Doom."
Huey says: "The mountain summit remains shrouded in mystery."
Huey says: "No one's ever seen the top, which makes it the perfect place to earn my Junior Woodchuck cartography badge."
Huey says: "Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a topographical landscape that hasn't already been mapped?"
Louie says: "No."
Huey says: "Well, very."
Huey says: "I've got a geographic information system, satellite radar detector, thermal..."
Scrooge says: "Bah, you don't need all that fancy doohickory."
Scrooge says: "All you need is your wits, determination, and these."
Scrooge says: "my old surveying tools."
Huey says: "Wow, the rusty with the wisdom of experience."
Scrooge says: "That's the spirit."
Scrooge says: "I'm going to be the first person to set foot on the top of Neverrest."
Huey says: "And I'm going to be the first person to draw a picture of it."
Launchpad says: "This is your captain speaking."
Launchpad says: "Flight doors are now open."
Scrooge says: "Ah, drink it in, kids."
Scrooge says: "Her deadly peaks, her bottomless crevices."
Scrooge says: "Her flawless sheets of brilliant white snow betray no hint of the ancient secrets hidden beneath."
Scrooge says: "Completely untrolled by man, the untamed majesty of Mt."
Scrooge says: "Neverrest."
Webby says: "Oh, churros."
opening theme says: "Huey: What are all these people doing here?"
opening theme says: "I thought this place was supposed to be uncharted territory."
opening theme says: "And this map isn't accurate at all."
opening theme says: "Mountain goats aren't native to this region and why is the sun wearing sunglasses?"
opening theme says: "Is he looking at another, brighter sun?"
Scrooge says: "Don't pay any attention to these tourists, my boy."
Scrooge says: "Nothing but tchotchkes and cheese puffs."
Scrooge says: "We're real explorers."
Huey says: "Like George Mallardy."
Louie says: "Who?"
Huey says: "Only the greatest mountaineer of the twentieth century."
Huey says: "Legend has it that Mallardy made it farther up the mountain than anyone, but was lost trying to rescue a fellow incompetent climber famously known as the Neverrest Ninny."
Louie says: "George Mallardy."
Louie says: "He died as he lived."
Louie says: "Breathing."
Scrooge says: "Ach, stop your havering."
Scrooge says: "That's just a load of nonsense to sell t-shirts to tourists."
Scrooge says: "We're going to outdo that quitter Mallardy by making it to the top."
Louie says: "You realize there's a difference between quitting and dying, right?"
Scrooge says: "Not to me."
Dewey says: "They never have "Dewey."
Webby says: "Everybody stand back!"
Webby says: "I've been waiting to do this my whole life."
Webby says: "Sledding!"
Webby says: "Hah, well, okay."
Dewey says: "Webby, Webby, you're doing it all wrong."
Dewey says: "If you want the maximum sledding experience, you need to wait for the maximum opportune moment."
Webby says: "We're going to sled down Mt."
Webby says: "Neverrest?"
Dewey says: "And/or die trying."
Webby says: "Woooo!!!"
Dewey says: "Woooo!!!"
Salesman says: "Hey pal, looking to prove your mettle up there on the slopes of old Neverrest?"
Launchpad says: "Yep."
Salesman says: "Big, strapping guy like you must be prepared for ice fever, right?"
Launchpad says: "You bet."
Launchpad says: "What is that?"
Salesman says: "You don't have any protection against the deadly ravages of ice fever?"
Salesman says: "It can strike even the most experienced climber down in mere minutes."
Launchpad says: "But it can take several minutes to climb Neverrest."
Launchpad says: "Maybe longer."
Launchpad says: "What do I do?"
Salesman says: "Buddy, I got just the thing for you."
Launchpad says: "Wow, these are pretty expensive."
Launchpad says: "You sure I need these?"
Salesman says: "That depends."
Salesman says: "Do you want your eyes to freeze out of your head?"
Launchpad says: "That would make flying harder."
Salesman says: "You'll also going to want this heat reflecting blanket, this oxygen tank to keep your mind sharp when the fever starts killing off your brain cells by the thousands, foot warmers, foot coolers, commemorative canteen, goop, grip, grop, and these state of the art smart heating gloves."
Salesman says: "They got an ice fever rating of eight..."
Launchpad says: "hmmm."
Salesman says: "..."
Salesman says: "out of seven?"
Launchpad says: "Oooohhh."
Scrooge says: "Alright, true explorers."
Scrooge says: "Now this mountain is going to throw everything she's got at us."
Louie says: "But it will be worth it when we find the treasure of Mt."
Louie says: "Neverrest."
Louie says: "Haha."
Scrooge says: "There is no treasure of Mt."
Scrooge says: "Neverrest."
Louie says: "Nope."
Louie says: "Louie out."
Louie says: "Already gone."
Louie says: "Have fun!"
Huey says: "Let's go set foot on the roof of the world!"
Dewey says: "And then throw ourselves off it!"
Webby says: "Yeah!"
Launchpad says: "First the ice fever takes your vision."
Launchpad says: "Then it makes you feel all warm and toasty, even though you're freezing to death."
Launchpad says: "Then it makes your limbs all heavy."
Scrooge says: "Ah, it's just a bit nippy."
Scrooge says: "How did you afford all that gear, anyway?"
Launchpad says: "Louie put it on his corporate credit card."
Scrooge says: "Louie doesn't have a corporate credit card."
Launchpad says: "Oh."
Launchpad says: "Louie gave me your credit card."
Webby says: "Now?"
Dewey says: "Not yet."
Dewey says: "We only got one shot at this."
Dewey says: "Once you're down, there's no coming back up."
Webby says: "Right."
Webby says: "Can't wait!"
Webby says: "Oof!"
Dewey says: "Maximum opportune moment."
Webby says: "Ach, fine."
Dewey says: ""Point of no return," "This way to certain death," "This way to cocoa."
Dewey says: "" Hmm..."
Dewey says: "Certain death!"
Webby says: "Certain death!"
Scrooge says: "That's the spirit!"
Launchpad says: "woaahh!!"
Scrooge says: "Launchpad, hand me my climbing spats, will you?"
Launchpad says: "Whoooaahhh!"
Launchpad says: "Ow!"
Launchpad says: "Oof!"
Launchpad says: "Ow!"
Scrooge says: "Launchpad?"
Launchpad says: "Ow!"
Launchpad says: "Oof!"
Launchpad says: "AAHHH!"
Webby says: "Where'd he go?"
Huey says: "He had half of our equipment."
Launchpad says: "Ahh, Oh, no more, Ahhh!"
Launchpad says: "Ugh, where am I?"
Launchpad says: "I've gone snow blind!"
Launchpad says: "The ice fever's setting in!"
Launchpad says: "NOOO!"
Launchpad says: "AAAHHH!"
Scrooge says: "Probably cozying up with hot cocoa along with Louie."
Scrooge says: "Anyone else want to chicken out?"
Scrooge says: "Last thing we need on this trip is a bunch of Neverrest ninnies."
Huey says: "I thought you said that was a myth."
Scrooge says: "Just because it's a myth doesn't mean it's not true."
Huey says: "Well actually it..."
Scrooge says: "Don't you worry, kids."
Scrooge says: "It'll take more than a pompous pile of pebbles to slow your old Uncle Scrooge down."
Scrooge says: "I promise, I won't let anything bad happen to you."
Dewey says: "Aah!"
Scrooge says: "From now on."
Scrooge says: "Nothing bad from now on."
Scrooge says: "Heads down, knees up."
Scrooge says: "Let's go."
Huey says: "I'm going to call this Murder Ridge, after Death Peak but before the Chasm of Infinite Despair."
Huey says: "Aw, I'll call that Bunny Rock."
Dewey says: "AAHHH!"
Webby says: "AAHHH!"
Huey says: "Hmm."
Huey says: "I'm still going to call it Bunny Rock."
Scrooge says: "Curse me kilts."
Huey says: "End of the line, Uncle Scrooge?"
Huey says: "Hmm..."
Dewey says: "Well, looks like we'll have to settle for a double luge de luge and a moderate ollie flatspin five-forty."
Webby says: "Sledding!"
Scrooge says: "Hehey!"
Scrooge says: "Nice try, Neverrest!"
Huey says: "Yeah!"
Dewey says: "Yeah!"
Webby says: "Aw, I mean, yeah..."
Launchpad says: "So hot."
Launchpad says: "Oh no, the next stage of ice fever."
Launchpad says: "I can't remove any of my gear or I'll freeze to death."
Launchpad says: "Limbs heavy."
Launchpad says: "Movements lethargic."
hot tubber says: "Watch it!"
hot tubber says: "Hey!"
Launchpad says: "I can hear the shrill wail of Neverrest's cruel wind calling me."
Launchpad says: ""Surrender..."
Launchpad says: "" No!"
Launchpad says: "this is not the end of Launchpad McQuack!"
Launchpad says: "It will be by plane crash or not at all!"
Launchpad says: "AAHHH!"
Launchpad says: "A YETI!"
Scrooge says: "Don't need this, or this, what even is this?"
Scrooge says: "Certainly don't need this."
Huey says: "Um, the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook suggests we need at least some of this stuff."
Scrooge says: "We don't need anything but grit, gumption, and an unwavering..."
Huey says: "..."
Huey says: "and water."
Webby says: "Now?"
Dewey says: "I think that would technically be more falling than sledding."
Scrooge says: "Haha, Take that, you magniloquent molehill."
Huey says: "What a rush!"
Huey says: "I thought we were done for."
Scrooge says: "Nonsense, lad."
Scrooge says: "We're going straight to the top."
Huey says: "We must have gained some serious altitude with that climb."
Huey says: "We should be closer than ever, and, wait, is that Bunny Rock?"
Huey says: "This can't be right."
Huey says: "Maybe we should backtrack to figure out where we went wrong."
Scrooge says: "Please, I'm sure that's an entirely different naturally occurring demon-faced rock."
Huey says: "Okay, but it is snowing so the smart thing to do is..."
Scrooge says: "..."
Scrooge says: "Set up camp!"
Scrooge says: "There's a cave up about five hundred meters ahead."
Scrooge says: "See?"
Dewey says: "Cool dark and foreboding cave, Uncle Scrooge."
Huey says: "But this area's uncharted."
Huey says: "How did you know this would be here?"
Webby says: "Uh, guys?"
Webby says: "I don't think we're the first climbers to have this idea."
Huey says: "Woah."
Dewey says: "Where are their heads?"
Webby says: "Found them!"
Huey says: "Um, maybe we find a slightly less deadly cave."
Huey says: "Wait, wait, the entrance was right here."
Huey says: "We must have got turned around, it's got to be here somewhere."
Dewey says: "Ennugh!"
Dewey says: "Is that?"
Scrooge says: "George Mallardy, greatest mountaineer of the twentieth century."
Webby says: "Wait, he's written something out on the wall, here."
Dewey says: ""Curse you, McDuck."
Scrooge says: "Urchins, If I had a nickel for every person who cursed me with their dying breath, I'd be twice as rich as I already am."
Huey says: "Junior Woodchuck Rule 1118: a woodchuck chief must always be honest with his crew."
Scrooge says: "Fine."
Scrooge says: "Ugh, I was the Neverrest Ninny."
Kids says: "What?"
Scrooge says: "Seventy-five years ago today, I hired Mallardy to make me up the mountain."
Scrooge says: "I just made my first million, and I wanted to mark the occasion by doing something no one had ever done."
Scrooge says: "I may have been a little inexperienced, but I didn't want to leave anything to chance."
Scrooge says: "Mallardy mocked me mercilessly."
Scrooge says: "He ordered me to lighten up my load."
Scrooge says: "I was afraid to risk my emergency supplies, and my sizable money belt."
Scrooge says: "So he cut me loose."
Scrooge says: "I was weighed down by doubt and branded the Neverrest Ninny."
Scrooge says: "Mallardy was never heard from again."
Scrooge says: "But he became the man to make it the farthest up the mountain."
Scrooge says: "Now, he's the second farthest."
Huey says: "Uncle Scrooge!"
Scrooge says: "What?"
Scrooge says: "He was a backstabbing blaggard who almost got me killed."
Huey says: "I think the mountain got even for you."
Scrooge says: "And now, we'll get even with the mountain."
Scrooge says: "We will brave the new frontier."
Scrooge says: "Chart the unknown."
Huey says: "How can I chart the unknown if I don't know what I'm charting?"
Huey says: "I'm telling you this mountain doesn't make any sense."
Webby says: "I think I hear the wind coming from this way."
Huey says: "Webby, wait!"
Scrooge says: "Good initiative, Webbigail."
Webby says: "Thanks, Mr."
Webby says: "McDuck."
Huey says: "Didn't you just..."
Huey says: "Weren't you..."
Webby says: "I found an opening."
Scrooge says: "Lead the way."
Dewey says: "Woo Hoo!"
Webby says: "We made it!"
Scrooge says: "We should be closer than ever now."
Huey says: "Is that Bunny Rock?"
Scrooge says: "Oh, Come on!"
Launchpad says: "The ice fever..."
Launchpad says: "its final stages..."
Launchpad says: "must..."
Launchpad says: "stay..."
Launchpad says: "warm..."
Louie says: "Um, Launchpad?"
Launchpad says: "So..."
Launchpad says: "warm..."
Louie says: "Launchpad!"
Launchpad says: "Ahhh!"
Launchpad says: "Louie!"
Launchpad says: "Is that you?"
Launchpad says: "Stay calm, little buddy."
Launchpad says: "We need to find a way off this island before ice fever takes up both."
Louie says: "You know ice fever is not a thing, right?"
Launchpad says: "You're talking crazy."
Launchpad says: "You must have it too."
Launchpad says: "Crazy talk is the third stage of ice fever."
Louie says: "Who told you that?"
Launchpad says: "The guy who sold me this blanket."
Louie says: "Standard double snake-oil, I see how it is."
Louie says: "Well no one cons my family but me."
Launchpad says: "Our combined body heat will save us both."
Launchpad says: "Soak in the wetness of my sweat."
Louie says: "Ew, so much wetness!"
Louie says: "ew!"
Scrooge says: "At last, after all these years."
Scrooge says: "the summit of Mt."
Scrooge says: "Neverrest."
Scrooge says: "We're in the clear, now, kids."
Scrooge says: "Ha Hah!"
Scrooge says: "ha hah..."
Huey says: "That's it!"
Huey says: "I'm putting my foot down."
Huey says: "We can't go forward."
Scrooge says: "Oh course we can."
Scrooge says: "The summit's right there."
Huey says: "We are violating every rule of my Junior Woodchuck training."
Huey says: "We're out of supplies."
Huey says: "It's starting to get cold, so even if we make it to the top, we'd freeze to death before we get down."
Huey says: "Oh, and we keep trying to go up this way, the whole thing is going to come crashing down."
Huey says: "This is all too risky!"
Scrooge says: "Don't you go ninny on me, lad."
Scrooge says: "You'll never get your cartography badge with that attitude."
Huey says: "I don't care!"
Huey says: "We have to turn around."
Huey says: "Now!"
Dewey says: "Now!"
Webby says: "Now!"
Huey says: "You already beat Mallardy."
Huey says: "Isn't that enough?"
Scrooge says: "No, we'd be daft to give up with the peak in our grasp."
Huey says: "It's not giving up, it's just having common sense."
Scrooge says: "For the last time, nothing bad is going to happen."
Dewey says: "AAAHHH!!!"
Webby says: "AAAHHH!!!"
Huey says: "Dewey!"
Huey says: "Webby!"
Scrooge says: "Kids!"
Webby says: "Yodellayheehoo!"
Huey says: "How did you guys get up there?"
Dewey says: "I don't know!"
Scrooge says: "Maybe Launchpad was right about ice fever."
Dewey says: "What are you..."
Dewey says: "Ow!"
Dewey says: "What?"
Scrooge says: "What the blistering bagpipes is going on here?"
Huey says: "Wormholes!"
Huey says: "This mountain is covered in some kind of mystical dimensional doorways that have been randomly zapping us around the trail all day."
Huey says: "Between the fog and the snow, we didn't even realize it."
Huey says: "That's why my map didn't make sense."
Scrooge says: "Chutzpah!"
Scrooge says: "A mountain protecting its peak with portals."
Scrooge says: "Neverrest, you beautiest butte, you never cease to amaze."
Scrooge says: "And you wanted to turn around."
Webby says: "What are you doing?"
Dewey says: "We're at the top of a magical mystery mountain."
Dewey says: "I'm going to find my sled like, now."
Webby says: "Yes!"
Dewey says: "What!"
Dewey says: "Woah hoh!"
Webby says: "Woah hoh!"
Dewey says: "I'm getting nauseous."
Webby says: "I'm getting nauseous."
Dewey says: "Are you getting nauseous?"
Webby says: "Are you getting nauseous?"
Dewey says: "My brain hurts!"
Webby says: "My brain hurts!"
Dewey says: "You know what I mean?"
Webby says: "You know what I mean?"
Huey says: "Careful, the more you shuffle around the less stable this ice fall becomes!"
Dewey says: "Hey, my sled."
Scrooge says: "Hmm."
Scrooge says: "I don't have to climb the ice fall, I just have to find the wormhole that sled fell through."
Huey says: "Uncle Scrooge, no!"
Scrooge says: "Ha Hah!"
Scrooge says: "I'm gonna do it!"
Scrooge says: "Mt."
Scrooge says: "Neverrest, consider yourself conquered!"
Scrooge says: "Conquered!"
Scrooge says: "Conquered!"
Scrooge says: "Conquered!"
Huey says: "Just stop!"
Huey says: "There's no way to reach the top."
Huey says: "The mountain won't let you."
Huey says: "Let this one go!"
Scrooge says: "Look how far we've come!"
Huey says: "Farther than anyone has ever made it."
Huey says: "Isn't that enough?"
Scrooge says: "I will not be the Neverrest Ninny for another seventy-five years."
Huey says: "Nobody has used the word ninny in seventy-five years."
Huey says: "Junior Woodchuck Rule 727: Sometimes the bravest thing an explorer can do is walk away."
Webby says: "Now?"
Dewey says: "Now!"
Scrooge says: "Now!"
Scrooge says: "Hang on Kiddos!"
Huey says: "AHH!"
Huey says: "Woah, Ahh!"
Huey says: "grrr..."
All says: "AHHH!"
All says: "Whew!"
All says: "AHHH!"
All says: "Whew!"
All says: "AHHH!"
All says: "Whew!"
All says: "AAAAHHHHH!!"
Salesman says: "Ooh!"
Salesman says: "Of course if you really want to survive in style, you'll need something from our Mallardy Selects Collection."
Louie says: "You!"
Louie says: "Are you the man who sold my friend all this useless equipment?"
Salesman says: "Ehh, uh..."
Louie says: "Look at him!"
Louie says: "He's dying of ice fever!"
Louie says: "All the overpriced junk you sold him did nothing!"
Salesman says: "Nah, no, that's impossible."
Louie says: "Tell that to this poor man."
Launchpad says: "I see a bright light."
Launchpad says: "This is it."
Launchpad says: "Louie, bury me among the clouds."
Louie says: "He's delirious!"
Salesman says: "No, he's an idiot."
Salesman says: "He's not dying of ice fever."
Salesman says: "Ice fever isn't real."
Tourists says: "grrr..."
Salesman says: "Um, maybe just of sort of not real?"
Tourists says: "I want a refund!"
Launchpad says: "Ha ha, You saved me!"
Launchpad says: "You carried me down the mountain single-handedly and cured me of ice fever!"
Louie says: "Sure."
Louie says: "Yeah."
Louie says: "Why not?"
Launchpad says: "Ha ha ha, we survived!"
Launchpad says: "Take that, Mt."
Launchpad says: "Neverrest!"
Launchpad says: "You won't claim our bodies, today!"
Webby says: "So, that's sledding, huh?"
Webby says: "Meh."
Huey says: "Sorry we didn't make it to the top, Uncle Scrooge."
Scrooge says: "Ah, don't worry."
Scrooge says: "There's more to Neverrest than just a mountain."
Scrooge says: "There's more to us than a couple of ninnies who couldn't climb it."
Scrooge says: "Plenty more adventures where that came from, eh lad?"
Scrooge says: "Now where the blazes is that hot cocoa stand?"
Scrooge says: "I am freezing."
