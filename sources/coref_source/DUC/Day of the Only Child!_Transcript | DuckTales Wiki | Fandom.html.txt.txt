Dewey looks both ways says: "Wait, where are Huey and Louie?"
closes the window's curtains. Dewey opens the chest says: "Wait, where are Huey and Louie?"
looks down says: "Wait, where are Huey and Louie?"
Dewey says: "Who?"
Webby says: "Um, your brothers?"
Dewey says: "Uh, Webby, I don't have brothers."
Dewey says: "I'm an only child."
Webby says: "Don't be ridicu..."
Webby says: "Oh, no."
Webby says: "We must be in some sort of dystopian alternate dimension."
Dewey says: "Calm down."
Dewey says: "Everything is fine."
Webby says: "Exactly what an evil Dewey-doppelganger would say!"
Webby says: "Give it up, Dew-pelganger!"
Webby says: "Where..."
Webby says: "is..."
Webby says: "Dewey?"
Huey says: "Webby, stop!"
Huey says: "That is Dewey!"
Louie says: "He's just doing a Dewey thing!"
Webby says: "Oh."
Dewey says: "Thank you, good Samaritans."
Dewey says: "You restored my faith in the kindness of random strangers."
Huey says: "Not even one hour in, and your stupid "Only Child Day" has already almost gotten one of us killed."
Webby says: ""Only" -what-now?"
Dewey says: "It's a beautiful holiday."
Huey says: "That he made up."
Dewey says: "Where, for a whole day, we get to be sibling-free  that an only child gets to do!"
Dewey says: "Make our marks on the world!"
Louie says: "Not have to answer to anyone!"
Huey says: "Be horribly alone?"
Dewey says: "I have my ways."
Huey says: "Of course, he put it on the day I need them both, the annual Junior Woodchuck Three-Man Cookout."
Louie says: "Boring."
Dewey says: "Ugh."
Dewey says: "Teamwork."
Louie says: "Well, as the now sole heir to Scrooge's fortune, I can finally make friends with Doofus Drake, the richest kid in Duckburg."
Louie says: "He only mingles with other obscenely rich heirs, so..."
Huey says: "What a snob."
Dewey says: "He's the worst."
Louie says: "You see the judgement that I have to live with?"
Louie says: "Well, today, your heartless criticism can't deny me my dream of being shamelessly spoiled."
Webby says: "What are you gonna do, Dewey?"
Dewey says: "I don't have to explain myself to you!"
Dewey says: "I'm an only child!"
Webby says: "I don't get why you're doing this."
Webby says: "Isn't being a triplet awesome?"
Huey says: "Thank you!"
Dewey says: "Who are you again, sassy stranger?"
Huey says: "The brother you rudely take for granted!"
Huey says: "Right, Louie?"
Dewey says: "The random passerby clearly loves Only Child Day, Right, Louie?"
Dewey says: "Or whoever you are?"
Louie says: "I just want to use a rich kid for his infinity pool!"
Louie says: "Why can't I have that for myself!"
Huey and Dewey fight.
Louie says: "Stop fighting!"
Louie says: "Stop it!"
Dewey says: "And this is why we need Only Child Day."
Huey slaps Dewey and the theme song plays.
Huey says: "Stupid Dewey."
Huey says: "Why can't I just have brothers that blindly listen to me for once?"
Woodchuck #1.
I don't say this enough, but I sure do love being a trio!
Woodchuck #2.
Yeah! Good things come in threes.
Woodchuck #3.
Ooh, like the three legs on this tripod.
Woodchuck #1.
Even three cheers! Hip....
Woodchuck #3.
Hip...
Huey says: "Hurray..."
Woodchuck #2.
See?
Huey talks to Launchpad as he's pitching a tent.
Huey says: "What do you mean I can't come?"
Huey says: "If I don't participate, I'll never get my commemorative cookout badge."
Huey says: "That means a lop-sided sash, Launchpad."
Huey says: "A LOP SIDED SASH!"
Launchpad says: "Sorry, but it's the three-man cookout."
Launchpad says: "I didn't get to be a troop leader by bending the rules."
Launchpad says: "I got it by crashing the bus during a camping trip and the other leaders quitting."
The Beagle Boys are spying on Huey and Launchpad.
Big Time says: "This is perfect."
Big Time says: "We can't have all four of those brats, but we could definitely nab one."
Bouncer says: "Uh, Big Time, we're starting to think you have an unhealthy obsession with kidnapping."
Bouncer says: "We're here if you want to talk about it."
Big Time says: "Wow, thanks!"
Big Time says: "Actually, there is something I'd like to say."
Big Time says: "GET MOVING!"
Huey says: "I can easily do the work of three woodchucks twice my size, see?"
Launchpad says: "Sorry."
Launchpad says: "Unless you can two other scouts..."
Launchpad says: "."
Launchpad says: "Ooh, how about them?"
Launchpad says: "And what are your names, mysterious woodchuck I'd never seen before?"
Bouncer says: "Tim..."
Bouncer says: "."
Bouncer says: "He's, uh, Timbo."
Huey says: "Launchpad, those are the Beagle Boys in disguise!"
Launchpad says: "Junior Woodchuck Rule #413: "Never speak ill of a fellow Woodchuck," unless you don't want that badge."
Huey says: "Possible death, definite badge, possible death, definite badge, definite badge."
Huey says: "Definite badge."
Huey starts picking berries.
Bouncer says: "Hey, look."
Bouncer says: "We found some firewood for you..."
Bouncer says: "."
Bouncer says: "next to a normal pile of twigs."
Huey says: "If you can't even build a proper pit trap, then how do you expect us to earn our cookout badges?"
Bouncer says: "Whaaaaaat?"
Bouncer says: "That is a pit trap?"
Huey says: "Here, let me show you."
Huey shows them how to make a proper pit trap. Bouncer and Burger are impressed. Big Time tries to ambush Huey from behind the bushes, but he missed and falls to the pit trap instead.
Huey says: "Mm-hm, the poachers knot was a good instinct, but what you want here is a double overhead noose."
Bouncer says: "Wow, that does work better."
Huey says: "All right, fold the ends over, go ahead."
Big Time gets caught in the noose.
Huey says: "Wow, Dewey and Louie would never have gotten this done so fast, o you know, even tried."
Huey says: "So, what do you wanna eat?"
Bouncer says: "You..."
Bouncer says: "want me to..."
Bouncer says: "chose?"
Huey says: "You earned it."
Huey says: "It's only fair."
Bouncer says: "Ffffaaaaaaiiiiiir?"
Huey says: "Junior Woodchuck Rule 72: "Always be fair to your fellow Woodchucks."
Bouncer says: "I..."
Bouncer says: "."
Bouncer says: "I think I know something."
Bouncer prepares food on the campfire.
Bouncer says: "Junkyard stew."
Huey says: "Mmm, is that cumin?"
Bouncer says: "Yeah, it complements the root vegetables."
Huey says: "It's..."
Huey says: "."
Huey says: "exquisite."
Bouncer says: "Really?"
Bouncer says: "Well, I've never eaten it before."
Bouncer says: "It's just usually thrown in my face."
Huey says: "Well, we don't do that here."
Huey says: "A Woodchuck looks out for his fellow scouts."
Huey says: "Every bear in the forest is gonna want this!"
Big Time throws the stew into Bouncer's face.
Big Time says: "What's taking you idiots so long?!"
Big Time says: "!"
Big Time says: "Ma's waiting for me to be the hero!"
Bouncer says: "That's not..."
Bouncer says: ".."
Bouncer says: "fair."
Big Time says: "So?"
Bouncer says: "And we should ask Huey if he wants to be snatched first."
Big Time says: "Ask?"
Big Time says: "Ugh, fine."
Big Time says: "If you numbskulls can't do it, I'll grab him myself."
Bouncer says: "We can't let you do that."
Big Time says: "What are you doing?"
Huey hangs up the stew with a rope.
Bouncer says: "Uh, Big Huey, sir?"
Bouncer says: "We kidnapped someone for you."
Huey says: "You did what?!"
Huey says: "!"
Bouncer says: "Well, he was gonna kidnap you first."
Huey says: "No!"
Huey says: "No!"
Bouncer says: "A Junior Woodchuck looks out for his fellow Woodchucks, no matter the cost."
Huey says: "He's gonna get killed!"
Huey says: "He's your brother!"
Bouncer says: "We like you better, new Big Time."
Bouncer says: "You'll love it back at the junkyard."
Bouncer says: "You'll never be lonely again."
Huey says: "Just help me get him down!"
Bouncer says: "You got it, boss!"
Huey says: "Ugh, this overhead noose is perfect!"
Huey says: "Why'd they have to actually pay attention to me?"
Huey says: "Dewey would have never tied this right!"
Huey says: "No, no!"
Huey says: "I meant carry him down, not cut him down..."
Huey says: "."
Huey says: "with impeccable chopping technique!"
Bouncer says: "Sure thing, boss!"
Huey says: "Gah!"
Huey says: "No!"
Huey says: "Don't blindly listen to me, I am NOT your boss!"
The tree falls down. Cut to Louie making his way to Doofus Drake's house. He knocks on the front door.
Butler says: "Can I help you?"
Louie says: "Ah, greetings."
Louie says: "I'm Sir Louie Duck Esquire III, your well-to-do neighbor and Scrooge McDuck's only nephew."
Louie says: "I'm here to meet fabulously wealthy Doofus Drake!"
Louie says: "Is this..."
Louie says: "his..."
Louie says: "his house?"
Butler says: "No, this is the servant quarters."
Butler says: "This way, please."
Louie says: "Wow, it's like he gets whatever he wants!"
Butler says: "No one says no to master Doofus."
Doofus Drake appears behind Louie sucking a sundae through a straw.
Louie says: "Oh!"
Louie says: "H-hi!"
Louie says: "Um,  allow me to introduce myself."
Louie says: "Sir Louie Duck Esquire III, the only nephew of Scrooge McDuck."
Louie says: "Well, since we're so alike, you know, both solo heirs, I- I figured it was high time that we rub elbows and..."
Doofus says: "Brain freeze."
Doofus searches through his pants while Louie frantically presses the elevator button.
Doofus says: "Friend present."
Louie says: "Oh."
Louie says: "For me?"
Doofus says: "I like to play with my friends."
Louie says: "All right, friend."
Louie says: "Heheh."
Louie says: "Let's play!"
Cuts to a montage of them playing together.
Louie says: "Literally living the dream."
Louie takes pictures in a photo booth and notices Doofus smelling his hair.
Doofus says: "You seem stressed."
Doofus says: "Come with me!"
Doofus leads Louie to his treasure room.
Doofus says: "This is where I come to blow off steam."
Louie says: "Is that an original Stradivarius violin?!"
Louie says: "!"
Louie says: "Are you nuts?!"
Louie says: "!"
Louie says: "Aren't you afraid you'll get in trouble?"
Doofus says: "Nah."
Louie says: "Of course."
Louie says: "Real wealth is not caring if people think you're crazy."
Louie says: "Because they can't stop you anyway!"
Louie and Doofus break various priceless objects, and high-five each other.
Louie says: "Gonna ignore that sweaty palm..."
Louie says: "."
Doofus high fives. Louie attempts to rip a painting of an old lady holding money.
Doofus says: "GUMMEEMAMA!"
What?
Doofus' servants says: "Gummeemama..."
Doofus' servants says: "."
Doofus says: "Gummeemama Francis, my dear deceased grandma who left me her entire fortune."
Doofus says: "No one touches her portrait, NO ONE!"
Doofus says: "I let you eat wall cotton, you impudent brat!"
Doofus says: "Are you smiling, servants?"
Doofus says: "IS THIS FUNNY TO YOU?!"
Doofus says: "!"
Louie says: "Soooo..."
Louie says: ".."
Louie says: "You're his butler, huh?"
Louie says: "Um, my butler's a ghost."
Louie says: "Yup."
Louie says: "Yeah, he's dead."
Maid says: "We're dead inside."
Maid says: "We're Doofus' parents."
Louie says: "Sorry, what?"
Mrs. Drake says: "He used to be such a sweet boy, but the money and power changed him."
Mrs. Drake says: "Go, before it's too late..."
Doofus says: "What's next, friendy-friend?"
Louie says: "Ah, you know, I just noticed it's getting a little late, and, uh, so I'm just gonna head home, fondly remember all the good times we had?"
Louie says: "Cool?"
Louie says: "All right, bye..."
Doofus presses a remote causing Louie's bracelet to cling to the floor.
Doofus says: "You are home, friend present."
Louie says: "Heeeelp!"
Louie says: "Guuuuys, I don't wanna be an only child anymore!"
Mr. Drake says: "The sooner you give up, the better."
Mr. Drake says: "Hope only makes it worse."
Louie says: "No!"
Louie says: "If the three of us work together, we might just be able to get out of here."
Louie says: "Are you with me?"
Doofus reenters the room.
Mr. Drake says: "The new one's a traitor, but I stopped him out of loyalty."
Mr. Drake says: "Because I love you, Doofus."
Mrs. Drake says: "You're pathetic."
Louie says: "No!"
Louie says: "He's lying, I would never do that!"
Louie says: "I'm your friend..."
Louie says: "present."
Louie says: "Oh, gross."
Doofus says: "I don't think I like you anymore, new friend."
Doofus says: "Maybe you need a lesson in friendship."
Louie says: "Wait, what's that for?"
Louie says: "What is he gonna do with the umbrella and walnuts?!"
Louie says: "!"
Huey and the Beagle Boys crash through the roof.
Huey says: "Louie!"
Louie says: "Ah!"
Louie says: "I'm safe!"
Doofus says: "New new friends."
Huey and Louie screams in terror.
Dewey says: "Whoops."
Dewey says: "Sorry, security bot."
Dewey says: "Just..."
Dewey says: "innocent kids stuff."
DT-87 chases Dewey down the hall, and Dewey slams the bedroom door on it.
Dewey says: "Finally alone."
Dewey says: "They'll never know my darkest secret."
Dewey says: "Live, on McDuck Manor!"
Dewey says: "Home to the most celebrated duck in Duckburg, and also Scrooge McDuck."
Dewey says: "It's "Dewey Dew-Night"!"
Dewey says: "Tonight."
Dewey says: "Laughs, thrills, a visit from Monsieur Saucy, and as always, the Dew Crew House Band!"
Dewey says: "And now, the man of the hour: Deeeweeeeeeeey!"
Dewey says: "Ahaha, thank you!"
Dewey says: "Thank you very much!"
Dewey says: "And welcome to the best show in this wing of the mansion."
Dewey says: "So what's going on?"
Dewey says: "What's in the news?"
Dewey says: "Ah, did you hear about this?"
Dewey says: "I'm an only child today!"
Dewey says: "It's gonna be great."
Dewey says: "It's all about Dewey now!"
Musician Dewey points at Host Dewey.
Dewey says: "So the big question is, what "Dewey" do?"
Musician Dewey shakes his head.
Dewey says: "What "Dewey" do?"
Family audience is a cardboard cutout.
Dewey says: "Woof, audience's a little stiff tonight."
Dewey says: "Am I right, Dewey?"
Musician Dewey makes an awkward noise.
Dewey says: "Ahaha!"
Dewey says: "That joke crashed so hard, you think it was Launchpad!"
Dewey says: "Nailed it, we got them back."
Dewey says: "Dewey, play me to the desk."
Dewey dances as he goes to the desk.
Dewey says: "Cool cool cool cool."
Dewey says: "This is of course a sample episode of our totally amazing show."
Dewey says: "So, if you're TV producer looking for a hit so fresh, so unique, and so top-secret even my brothers can't know about it, this is the show for you."
Dewey says: "So, my first guest is..."
Dewey says: "."
Dewey says: "I'm very excited..."
Dewey says: "."
Dewey says: "for my first..."
Dewey says: "g- Aaah, maybe should've thought about this before I kicked everyone out."
Dewey says: "Oh!"
Dewey grabs a toy robot and a red cap.
Dewey says: "Please give a warm round of applause to my first guest and former bro, Huey."
Dewey says: "Hey, Huey, thanks for coming on the show."
Dewey says: "Eheh, hey, buddy, good to have you."
Dewey says: "So how are you enjoying Only Child Day?"
I fear it deeply. Being a triplet is a way of life. Things are better in threes... Threes... Threes!
Dewey says: "Weird."
Dewey says: "Super weird!"
Dewey says: "Okay, I'm gonna ask you a surge of questions here we gooo..."
Dewey says: ".."
Dewey says: "What's your name?"
Huey.
Dewey says: "Do you love calendars?"

Dewey says: "Aaaaahhhh!"
Robo-Huey Dewey.
I will pet your cat, but in a very aggressive way!
DT-87 moves up closer to the door.
Dewey says: "Robo-Huey is on a rampage!"
Dewey says: "Now that's good television."
Dewey says: "Speaking of, my next guest, um..."
Dewey says: "."
Dewey says: "my next..."

Dewey says: "."
Robo-Huey Dewey.

DT-87 eyes glow red.
Robo-Huey Dewey.
Submit. Submit!
Dewey says: "Die, robot scum!"
Dewey says: "Hi-yah!"
Thanks, Dewey. You're my hero!
Dewey says: "Oh, stop!"
You're no anonymous middle child, you're the unique glue that hold us brothers together. audience awws.
Dewey says: "Comedy, action, and heart?"

A laser beam cuts the door open.
DT-87.
Robotic intruder detected.
Dewey says: "My demo tape!"
Dewey says: "We gotta go."
Dewey says: "My apologies to Monsieur Saucy."
DT-87 chases Dewey into a closet.
Dewey says: "Oh, this is bad, real bad."
Dewey says: "Huey, you got a plan, right?"
Sorry, I'm technically you, and since you don't have a plan, neither do I.
Dewey says: "Hey, I don't need you, I'm self-sufficient!"
Dewey says: "Louie, you can talk your way outta this, right?"
Yeah, sure, no problemo. Wait, no, I'm also you, ho boy....
Dewey says: "Stupid Only Child Day!"
DT-87 cuts open the closet door.
DT-87.
Hello, intruder. You are cornered. Perhaps you shouldn't have pushed your brothers away. Maybe appreciate the fact, because certain people would do anything to have siblings. No one you know, certain... hypothetical people.
Dewey says: "Webby, you can come out."
DT-87's head flips back to reveal an embarrassed Webby.
Dewey says: "How did you get in there?"
Webby says: "Oh, I just jammed it open and ripped out a bunch of wires to make room."
Webby says: "What were you doing?"
Dewey says: "Whaaat?"
Dewey says: "Meee?"
Dewey says: "Haha, nothing!"
She knows.....
Dewey says: "Shut up, Louie..."
Dewey says: "."
Dewey says: "I can't believe you're spoiling my Only Child Day."
Dewey says: "You couldn't just let me have this one thing."
Webby says: "I'm sorry, but you guys just got here."
Webby says: "I don't want you splitting up."
Dewey says: "Webby..."
DT-87.
Intruders detected. Put your hands in the air. Dewey and Webby do as they're told You have twenty seconds to comply.
Dewey says: "We're complying, why doesn't it see we're complying?!"
Dewey says: "!"
Webby says: "I, uh, sort of cut some of it's processing circuits."
DT-87.
You have five seconds to comply. Four... Three... Two...
Webby says: "Dewey!"
Dewey climbs on DT-87's back and rides him all the way to Doofus Drake's mansion.
Dewey says: "Huey!"
Dewey says: "Louie!"
Huey says: "Beagle Boys."
Louie says: "Psycho rich kid."
Dewey says: "Haywire robot."
The triplets says: "Brothers again?"
The triplets says: "Brothers again."
The triplets says: "Triple threat!"
Doofus says: "Gimme, gimme, for my gimme tree!"

Doofus says: "You're funny."
Doofus says: "I'm keeping you."

DT-87 shoot's Doofus's bracelet away.
Huey says: "Just a quick rewiring of the manifold."
Bouncer says: "One of us, one of us..."
Bouncer says: "."
Big Time says: "You two jerks are gonna help me kidnap those boys, or I'm gonna scald you with more than soup!"
Bouncer says: "I'd rather be soup-blinded than have to stare at your dumb face!"
Louie says: "Hey!"
Louie says: "If there's one thing I know, it's that you hate each other."
Louie says: "You yell at each other, you fight with each other, you fail Ma Beagle with each other."
Louie says: "Because you're Beagle Boys."
Louie says: "And who in this world can antagonize you more than your own brother?"
Big Time says: "Oh, please."
Bouncer says: "Let's never not fight again."
Big Time says: "Gaah, heeey..."
Big Time says: "."
DT-87 cut a hole in the front entrance.
Webby says: "You guys!"
Webby says: "Are you brothers again, or..."
Webby says: "."
Webby says: "did this whole thing happen in another dimension..."

Huey says: "Definitely brothers!"
Dewey says: "Definitely brothers!"
Louie says: "Whatever makes you not hurt me!"
Webby says: "So you're not gonna break up?"
Dewey says: "Of course not!"
Dewey says: "We never were."
Dewey says: "We need each other."
Huey says: "Yeah."
Huey says: "I love being a triplet, but we still have to be our own people."
Louie says: "Well, I guess Only Child Day wasn't an absolute disaster after all."
Dewey says: "Eeehhh, sibling calendaaaar?"
Huey says: "I'm a hundred percent sure I'm going to regret this, but fine."
Dewey says: "All right, Louie, we did it!"
Huey says: "Pretty sure Louie was with me on this."
Louie says: "I still have two more hours of only child day you guys figure it out."
Huey says: "Good point."
Huey says: "Au revoir, strangers!"
Dewey says: "So, uuuh, how much did you see?"
Dewey says: "You know when you..."
Dewey says: "when you came into my room."
