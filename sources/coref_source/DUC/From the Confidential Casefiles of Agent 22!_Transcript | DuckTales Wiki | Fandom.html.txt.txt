Boys says: "Yeah, yeah, sure..."
Louie says: "Shhhh."
Webby says: "So, where are we going?"
Scrooge says: "' 'We' ' are going nowhere."
Webby says: "But you are going to save Granny, aren't you?"

Webby says: "Oh, with Granny missing, can I be your partner on this one?"
Webby says: "Please give me a chance."
Webby says: "I'm trained in espionage, counter espionage, I'm super good at secret keeping."
Scrooge says: "We're too far to turn back now, but you'll be safe on the sub."
Scrooge says: "Ah!"
Launchpad says: "Sorry, blindfold slopped."
Launchpad says: "Still no clue where we are."
Scrooge says: "On second thought."
Webby says: "I can come?"

Scrooge says: "What, you expect me to chip in myself?"
Beakley says: "You are a billionaire."

Beakley says: "Don't underestimate its adorable appearance."
Beakley says: "It's actually..."
present says: "Scrooge:..."
present says: "an elite killing machine."
present says: "Not some adorably jovial globule."
Webby says: "I know, that's a vintage series two troub-bubble series twenty filled with incendium."
Webby says: "It will ignite anything it lands on."
Webby says: "So cool."
Scrooge says: "You know most kids wouldn't get this excited over their impending doom."
Scrooge says: "Louie mostly just cries."
Scrooge says: "What are you..."
Webby says: "Ah!"
Webby says: "Gassing it from incendium to helium."
Scrooge says: "I haven't seen a maneuver that impressive since..."

past says: "What is it?"
Scrooge says: "Strange berry bushes."
Scrooge says: "They don't look native to the island."
Scrooge says: "Could be poisonous."
Scrooge says: "They weren't."
Beakley says: "What is wrong with you?"
Beakley says: "There are rules."
Beakley says: "Protocol."
Scrooge says: "Listen up, 22, you got to be willing to make things up as you go along."
Scrooge says: "I didn't get this far in life by following the rules."
Beakley says: "Great, and now you're dying."
Scrooge says: "Worse, I got a stem caught in my throat."
Scrooge says: "Anyway, onward."
present says: "Webby: Oohhh, nnngn, heh heh heh nnnggnn."

Scrooge says: "This was worse when they were alive."
Scrooge says: "Impressive."
Scrooge says: "All those years in my house, we should have done something like this sooner."
Webby says: "Granny always told me to never bother you."
Webby says: "If you wanted to do something, you come to me."
Webby says: "But you were always so busy with your business and your grumbling."
Webby says: "But I was busy too, with Granny's training and my research, about you."
Webby says: "So you know we both had our own things going on."
Webby says: "I guess you can say I've been prepping for a McDuck/Agent 22 adventure my whole life."
Scrooge says: "You know so much about me, and I feel I know so little about you."
Webby says: "Oh come on, you know about me, like my favorite color is..."
Webby says: "Pink."
Webby says: "My favorite booby trap is spike pits, my favorite storm is tropical cyclone meets thunder snow."
Scrooge says: "I know your favorite drink."
Scrooge says: "Nutmeg tea."
Webby says: "Juice."
Scrooge says: "But I saw you down a whole pot not this morning."
Webby says: "Nah, oh no that was just to impress you."
Webby says: "I kind of can't stand it."

Black Heron says: "Where was I?"
Black Heron says: "Oh yes, After meticulous very ingenious planning, I have obtained history's greatest biological weapon."
Black Heron says: "With the completed formula, I will breed an army of super soldiers that will BOUNCE to the highest peaks of corruption."
Scrooge says: "Heh, did you just say bounce?"
Black Heron says: "Who is this?"
Black Heron says: "Is he with you?"
Beakley says: "Unfortunately: Scrooge: You're making a bounce serum."
Beakley says: "The untold powers of the ancient creatures is bouncing?"
Black Heron says: "Yes, they'll be bouncing here there and everywhere."
Black Heron says: "Mass destruction that's beyond compare."
Black Heron says: "Stop laughing."
Black Heron says: "I have wasted an entire reel of film and you're not even entirely in frame."
Beakley says: "What are you doing?"
Scrooge says: "Fighting a deadly supervillain apparently."
Beakley says: "You're out of your league."
Scrooge says: "Uwah!"
Scrooge says: "eh!"
Beakley says: "I could try a coupling gambit."
Scrooge says: "22, little help."
Beakley says: "I'm working out a plan."
Scrooge says: "I got a plan, just do something."

Black Heron says: "She didn't."
Webby says: "Where's my Granny?"
Scrooge says: "Easy, lass."
Scrooge says: "This one's out of your league."
Webby says: "Nobody's out of our league, Mr."
Webby says: "McDuck."
Webby says: "We can take her."
Scrooge says: "Webby!"
Scrooge says: "ugh..."
Webby says: "Uhuhuh..."
Beakley says: "Wake up!"
Beakley says: "Wake Up!"
Beakley says: "Wake!"
Beakley says: "Up!"
Beakley says: "I can't believe you."
Beakley says: "What is my granddaughter doing here?"
Beakley says: "On a SHUSH assignment of all things."
Beakley says: "She's just a little girl."
Scrooge says: "I know."
Black Heron says: "Silence!"
Black Heron says: "I've waited so long for this, 22."
Black Heron says: "Decades lying and hiding, tracking you down, rebuilding this place, rebuilding myself."
Black Heron says: "But this time, 22, I'm better prepared."
Black Heron says: "World domination can wait; this, this is sweet revenge."
Black Heron says: "Now, tell me the formula."
Beakley says: "Ha ha, it was years ago."
Beakley says: "How am I supposed to remember?"
Beakley says: "Wait, what are you..."
Black Heron says: "Come come, 22."
Black Heron says: "Protocol dictates you memorize all mission related data, and you're even more fastidious than I am."
Black Heron says: "So you have three tenths of a second to respond, or..."
Webby says: "Don't do it!"
Webby says: "Uh!"
Beakley says: "Six handfuls of red berries, four orange berries, three purple berries, four blue berries, three green berries, and one yellow berry in that order."
Scrooge says: "Bentina."
Black Heron says: "Finally, the powers of the ancients are mine..."
Beakley says: "You're deranged, Heron."
Black Heron says: "Would you please not interrupt..."
Black Heron says: "No, no, 22, you won't throw me off my game, this time."
Black Heron says: "I am prepared for every eventuality."
Black Heron says: "Now the child was a bit of an X-factor, but she will be the cherry on this sweet revenge."
Scrooge says: "Leave her out of this, Heron."
Scrooge says: "She's just a defenseless girl, she has no place here."
Scrooge says: "A damsel in distress is what she is."
Scrooge says: "It was a mistake to bring a hapless hellion."
Scrooge says: "She should be at home with her pink bows, enjoying a glass of her favorite "tea."
Webby says: "I don't like tea!"
Webby says: "I like..."
Black Heron says: "This bores me."
Black Heron says: "Time to move on to the revenging."
Webby says: "hah!"
Black Heron says: "What are you, child?"
Scrooge says: "That's Webby Vanderduck, my new partner."
Webby says: "Yeah, but it's actually VanderQUACK!"
Webby says: "Woah!"
Webby says: "Ooh!"
Beakley says: "Webby!"

Scrooge says: "Your granddaughter is full of surprises."
On the roof says: "Black Heron: Get away!"
On the roof says: "Get away!"
Webby says: "Gimme that juice, you bad baddie!"
Black Heron says: "No, no, it's wearing off."
Black Heron says: "No!"
Black Heron says: "This is all your fault!"
Black Heron says: "AAHHH!"
Beakley says: "Flip six three hold!"
Scrooge says: "Ha hah, it worked!"
Webby says: "Team up!"
Black Heron says: "Aahh!"
Scrooge says: "Launchpad, take us home."
Launchpad says: "Roger that."
Launchpad says: "Going in blind."
Webby says: "Ho ho, that was so amazing."
Webby says: "Agent 22 and McDuck back in action."
Webby says: "But, but hey, what did happen in that first battle with Black Heron?"
past says: "Scrooge: Just do something!"
Beakley says: "Dash it all."
Beakley says: "This is disconcerting!"
Beakley says: "What is happening?"
Black Heron says: "You will pay for that!"
Scrooge says: "Augh!"
Scrooge says: "22, you just broke protocol for me."
Beakley says: "For the mission, and you, partner."
Scrooge says: "Welp, time to go."
Black Heron says: "No!"
Beakley says: "I have a feeling I'm going to be cleaning up a lot of your messes from here on out, Agent McDuck."
Scrooge says: "Call me Scrooge."
Beakley says: "Betina Beakley."
