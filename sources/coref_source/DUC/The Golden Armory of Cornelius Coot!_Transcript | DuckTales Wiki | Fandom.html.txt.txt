The Episode begins on Fort Duckburg, at the Cornelius Coot statue, where Mrs. Quackfaster are telling Huey, Dewey, Louie and Webby about Cornelius Coot.
Mrs. Quackfaster says: "The Legendary Cornelius Coot!"
Mrs. Quackfaster says: "Surrounded by his foes, he drew the storied sabre and fought the Beagles militia, ruthless like a ghost!"
Mrs. Quackfaster says: "His musket fire came from the confused Beagles, running for their lives, singly saved this very fort and that's the story how he started a little town called..."
Mrs. Quackfaster says: "uh, anyone?"
Louie says: "Duckburg!"
Dewey says: "Duckburg!"
Huey says: "Duckburg!"
Webby says: "Duckburg!"
Quackfaster says: "Coot stamped himself upon our history in a way few ever will."
Webby says: "We'll see about that."
Quackfaster says: "As a special treat today, Coot's descendant, Della Duck, will sky write the letter 'C' to commemorate him."
Dewey says: "Just a 'C'?"
Louie says: "Uncle Scrooge charges by the letter."
Louie says: "I'm parched."
Louie says: "You got any refreshments?"
Louie says: "Maybe some Pep?"
Quackfaster says: "In this village, we only have traditional victuals, saltwater jerky, and raw buttermilk."
Dewey says: "Hey guys, check me out."
Dewey says: "I'm churning butter like Cornelius Coot."
Dewey says: "Churn baby, churn, yah ha ha, yeah."
Dewey says: "Yep, and I'm bored."
Dewey says: "This is, what's the word?"
Louie says: "The most horrible place ever?"
Dewey says: "Yes, exactly."
Dewey says: "Thank you."
Huey says: "This capotain isn't even itchy enough to be authentic."
Huey says: "Let's see if we can fly with Mom."
Webby says: "Sure we could go, unless we want to uncover the greatest mystery your mom never solved."
Dewey says: "Woah, is that?"
Webby says: "Della's old journal."
Webby says: "She was searching for a top-secret family treasure from the non-McDuck side of your family."
Webby says: "the Beagles weren't just after the fort, they were after the Golden Armory of Cornelius Coot."
Webby says: "Untold treasure."
Webby says: "Undiscovered history, Unparalleled adventure."
Webby says: "Della couldn't crack it, but we can."
Ma Beagle says: "Not if I get there first."
Opening theme says: "Della: Ah, the perfect day."
Opening theme says: "Just me, the open sky, the cloud slayer, and where's my plane?!"
Opening theme says: "!"
Launchpad says: "Right here, Ms."
Launchpad says: "D."
Launchpad says: "And there, and a bit over there."
Launchpad says: "Don't worry, the sun chaser has been through way worse than this."
Della says: "It has?"
Launchpad says: "Yeah, we've been through hundreds, maybe thousands of crashes together."
Launchpad says: "If this old girl could talk."
Della says: "Grrr."
Della says: "Listen, L."
Della says: "P."
Della says: "I need to fly over Fort Duckberg in t-minus three hours."
Launchpad says: "Don't worry."
Launchpad says: "We can stitch this baby back together in no time."
Launchpad says: "Just need to find Spinny Boy."
Della says: "Spinny Boy?"
Launchpad says: "There he is."
Huey says: "Webby, most historians consider this stuff to be a myth."
Huey says: "Coot was a ghost with a golden armory."
Huey says: "He was everywhere at once."
Huey says: "All myths."
Louie says: "Yeah, everyone and their mother went looking for that treasure."
Webby says: "Correction: everyone and "your" mother."
Webby says: "We solved some big mysteries before, but this, this is the one that could make us legends!"
Huey Dewey says: "Hisss."
Louie says: "Hisss."
Ma Beagle says: "Everyone thinks that Coot is some big gang hero beating up sixty defenseless Beagles, but we're going to set things right, force the tour guide to give up the goods, and reclaim the treasure of Fort Beagleburg."
Big Time says: "Ma!"
Big Time says: "Ma!"
Big Time says: "Y'all forgot me at the junkyard."
Big Time says: "I chased you here."
Big Time says: "Must not have heard me yelling to slow down cause you rolled the windows up."
Ma Beagle says: "Ugh."
Big Time says: "wha."
Ma Beagle says: "Big Time, if the Beagle Boys Organization is gonna reclaim it's former glory, we're going to have to go in a different direction."
Ma Beagle says: "A non-failure direction."
Ma Beagle says: "You're a failure as a criminal, a Beagle, and a son."
Big Time says: "So, what are you trying to say?"
Ma Beagle says: "You're no longer a member of the gang."
Big Time says: "Cause I'm more of a gang leader, right?"
Ma Beagle says: "Ugh, come on boys, let's go grab us a tour guide."
Ma Beagle says: "He'll figure it out eventually."
Huey says: "Nothing to see here."
Huey says: "History is a living document."
Huey says: "Archaeologists at work here, people."
Dewey says: "Alright, where do we dig?"
Webby says: "It says here, "find the truth beneath the legend."
Webby says: "" Hmm."
Dewey says: "That's it."
Dewey says: "I'm digging."
Louie says: "Oh!"
Louie says: "Oh no, my delicious gloppy history treat."
Webby says: "Shh."
Webby says: "Listen."
Huey says: "There's something under here."
Webby says: "Truth beneath the legend."
Quackfaster says: "mnnmm mmnmmnm!"
Quackfaster says: "manmmnmm!"
Quackfaster says: "bbmmm!"
Ma Beagle says: "Ugh!"
Big Time says: "That used to be me out there getting slapped by Ma."
Big Time says: "Innkeep, another buttermilk for which to drown my sorrows."
Quackfaster says: "It'll be a minute."
Big Time says: "S'alright."
Big Time says: "I's got nowhere to be."
Kids says: "Ungh!"
Kids says: "Rrgh!"
Kids says: "Ugh!"
Kids says: "Woah!"
Webby says: "Told you."
Webby says: "Now lets go!"
Big Time says: "The Coot gold."
Big Time says: "The McDuck brats are gonna get it first."
Big Time says: "I got to tell..."
Big Time says: "nobody."
Big Time says: "It's Big Time's time to make a name for himself."
Big Time says: "Innkeep, make that buttermilk for the road."
Big Time says: "Come on, come on, hurry up, hurry up!"
Launchpad says: "I did it."
Launchpad says: "I found a photo of what the plane is supposed to look like so we can piece it together."
Launchpad says: "Let's start from the corners."
Della says: "Ugh."
Launchpad says: "Woah!"
Della says: "Ew."
Della says: "Why is everything sticky?"
Launchpad says: "I used to use superglue to assemble the plane, but it proved tricky."
Launchpad says: "Now, I use gum."
Della says: "Ugh!"
Della says: "Ah!"
Della says: "Oof!"
Launchpad says: "Ugh!"
Della says: "So you like, don't know what you're doing at all?"
Launchpad says: "When it comes to planes, everyone knows their own way."
Della says: "Is, is that a hamster wheel?"
Launchpad says: "Yeah, well obviously a gerbil couldn't spin the propeller."
Louie says: "Cool."
Louie says: "So, this is our tomb."
Webby says: "Alright, let's go!"
Webby says: "Everyone feel around."
Louie says: "Okay, rocky, ooh, stony, pebbly, woah oh!"
Louie says: "Pointy, metal, gold?"
Louie says: "Nope."
Louie says: "Rusty shovel."
Louie says: "Gross."
Webby says: "It's an arrow pointing ahead."
Webby says: "We're on the right track."
Webby says: "I'm coming for your treasure, Coot!"
Webby says: "Ugh!"
Webby says: "This wall, here, is not a wall."
Webby says: "Coot must have made a decoy wall out of peat moss."
Webby says: "Ingenious."
Kids says: "Ahh!!"
Kids says: "Ahh!"
Kids says: "Oof!"
Webby says: "Take that, moss wall."
Huey says: "Hmm, it doesn't taste mossy enough to be moss."
Huey says: "What is that texture?"
Louie says: "Just relax, Louie."
Louie says: "Think of all the stuff you're going to buy with the treasure, okay?"
Louie says: "An empire brothers ottoman, case of imported Pep Superior, an emerald studded hoodie."
Louie says: "Do not laugh in the face of my danger!"
Dewey says: "I'm not."
Dewey says: "Huey's tickling me."
Huey says: "No I'm not."
Dewey says: "Yes, you-."
Dewey says: "Webby, turn your phone light on."
Webby says: "It is on."
Dewey says: "Well, I can't see a thing."
Webby says: "What?"
Webby says: "Oh, dear."
Kids says: "Aahh!"
Huey says: "Bleh!"
Huey says: "Aahh!"
Louie says: "Help me."
Kids says: "Aaah!!!"
Launchpad says: "Ah, she's smiling."
Launchpad says: "Happy plane, happy flight."
Launchpad says: "Ooh."
Della says: "Don't."
Della says: "Paint's still wet."
Della says: "Don't."
Della says: "I just detailed that."
Della says: "Don't."
Della says: "Because I, I don't want you near my plane at all."
Della says: "Sorry, it's not personal."
Della says: "It's just that."
Della says: "You know you're a bad pilot, right?"
Della says: "Not only in the sense that you crash every time you fly, he he he."
Della says: "Look, maybe with a couple of lessons."
Launchpad says: "That's it."
Launchpad says: "I can be your co-pilot."
Della says: "What?"
Della says: "Noooo."
Launchpad says: "I should learn from the best, right?"
Della says: "How do I say yes without agreeing to this?"
Launchpad says: "Yeah, best teacher ever!"
Della says: "Oh no, don't do that."
Della says: "Don't, ugh, get on the plane."
Launchpad says: "Hmm hmm hmm hmm."
Webby says: "Hup hup hup hup."
Webby says: "Nice try, Coot, but you'll never break us."
Louie says: "Ugh, uhgh, so many legs everywhere."
Louie says: "Ugh, I want to go home."
Louie says: "Yahh, ehnn, ahh!"
Webby says: "Huh?"
Webby says: "Aw."
Louie says: "Hey, is it me, or does she seem a little more "Webby" than usual?"
Huey says: ""Dangerous obsession that kills us all" thing?"
Huey says: "Maybe we should head back."
Dewey says: "Yeah, this adventure's a bust."
Webby says: "You know, Dewey, we should go."
Webby says: "No sense getting distracted by riding this amazing mine cart."
Dewey says: "I'm sorry, mine cart?"
Dewey says: "This is the ultimate."
Dewey says: "Everybody in."
Dewey says: "We ride to Coot's gold!"
Big Time says: "Aaahhh!"
Big Time says: "Ha ha hah spiders!"
Big Time says: "Ha ha gah!"
Big Time says: "Ugh!"
Webby says: "Big Time?"
Webby says: "The Beagles are after the treasure again."
Webby says: "Quit repeating yourself, history, you rascal."
Webby says: "Let's roll!"
Kids says: "Woah!"
Big Time says: "Huh, gnah."
Webby says: "Hup, gngh."
Dewey says: "Hup, gngh."
Della says: "Okay, lesson one."
Della says: "You've got your altimeter, tachometer."
Launchpad says: "And don't forget the point-a-meter."
Della says: "The what?"
Launchpad says: "The point-a-meter tells you how many points you earned."
Launchpad says: "My high score is 5000."
Della says: "That's the airspeed indicator."
Della says: "You've gone 5000 miles?"
Della says: "Why don't you just, heh heh, stare out of the window to make sure we're still in the air?"
Launchpad says: "No prob."
Launchpad says: "Still in the air, still in the air, wait, still in the air."
Webby says: "Ugh, ooh, the mine cart chase adventure for the ages."
Big Time says: "Ah, ugh, ugh."
Della says: "Ooh, ooh, ugh."
Della says: "Why is this stupid seat so loose?"
Launchpad says: "So you can talk to the people behind you."
Launchpad says: "It reassures the passengers when you look into their eyes while you crash."
Della says: "Yeah, yeah."
Della says: "Running light okay."
Della says: "Get to fort to celebrate ancestor."
Launchpad says: "You seem tense."
Launchpad says: "Shh."
Launchpad says: "Just relax."
Launchpad says: "Turn your mind off."
Launchpad says: "Just gaze at the clouds."
Launchpad says: "Nothing matters."
Della says: "Everything matters!"
Della says: "It's six tons of metal in the air that I just had to completely reassemble!"
Della says: "Just sit over there, and don't distract me!"
Launchpad says: "Still in the air."
Webby says: "Yes!"
Webby says: "We made it!"
Louie says: "Oh man, are we still here?"
Louie says: "Ugh, I had this amazing dream that we weren't."
Huey says: "What happened to Big Time?"
Webby says: "He must have gotten caught in that spider infested tunnel."
Huey says: "Gross."
Louie says: "Why are there so many spider tunnels?"
Webby says: "Huey, look."
Webby says: "What is this?"
Webby says: "A relic?"
Webby says: "One of Coot's old weapons?"
Webby says: "Proof of the legendary myths?"
Huey says: "An old rusty scythe."
Webby says: "Or a marker pointing this way?"
Webby says: "Guys, we're almost where your mom's journal entries end."
Webby says: "A few more steps, and we have made it farther than anyone."
Webby says: "If we solve this, we can be as incredible as she is, or as Coot was."
Dewey says: "Listen Webby."
Dewey says: "I don't think we should."
Webby says: "Perfect."
Webby says: "Don't think."
Webby says: "Let's go!"
Kids says: "Webby, don't!"
Webby says: ""Cornelius Coot Arms."
Webby says: "" This is it, the Golden Armory."
Louie says: "Treasure."
Dewey says: "Adventure."
Huey says: "Historical accuracy."
Kids says: "Ah!"
Kids says: "Ooh!"
Kids says: "Woo hoo, ahh!"
Webby says: "We uncovered the legend."
Webby says: "Proven we're worthy."
Webby says: "We did what nobody else could do."
Louie says: "Bleh, corn?"
Webby says: "What?"
Webby says: "No, no no no no I."
Webby says: "Maybe the treasure is beneath the corn."
Webby says: "Or, uh, maybe there's a further riddle, and you have to find the golden scythe of corn, or."
Huey says: "It's a blueprint."
Huey says: "Coot's very own system for storing corn."
Huey says: "Those weren't mine carts."
Huey says: "They were corn carts."
Huey says: "And those markers we found along the way were just farm tools."
Dewey says: "So, Coot was just a boring non-adventuring farmer?"
Louie says: "And his treasure was dirty, smelly corn?"
Louie says: "Worst treasure hunt ever!"
Huey says: "Sorry, Webby."
Huey says: "It's over."
Huey says: "Let's go home."
Webby says: "No no no no no."
Webby says: "I know there's more to this."
Webby says: "It's, it's Coot's final test."
Webby says: "If it's not real, then how did he save the fort?"
Webby says: "How did he stop the Beagles?"
Ma Beagle says: "And how are you gonna get out of this alive?"
Webby says: "Yeah!"
Webby says: "Oh."
Ma Beagle says: "Coots, Ducks, McDucks."
Ma Beagle says: "You make yourself out to be heroes, but you're all frauds and cheats."
Ma Beagle says: "So we followed that idiot Big Time while he followed you."
Webby says: "We'll never tell you the secret of Coot's loot."
Louie says: "The treasure's corn."
Louie says: "It's in there."
Louie says: "Knock yourself out."
Webby says: "Yeah exactly."
Webby says: "There's absolutely no gold."
Webby says: "No gold, whatsoever."
Webby says: "Yes there is."
Ma Beagle says: "Never already."
Ma Beagle says: "Ain't one of you fools bad enough to be a Beagle?"
Della says: "Woo, let's see how she sky writes."
Della says: "What's going on?"
Launchpad says: "Must be the hose you repaired in the smoke pump."
Della says: "What?"
Launchpad says: "I usually just block it a little with gum, so that the smoke can still vent."
Launchpad says: "Ah, but what do I know?"
Della says: "I, I can't see."
Della says: "We're going to crash!"
Launchpad says: "Crash?"
Launchpad says: "I'm on it."
Della says: "Aahh!"
Webby says: "Ugh, oohf, aah!"
All says: "Ahh, oof."
Della says: "Ah, you madman!"
Della says: "We almost died,  Weird."
Webby says: "Della!"
Della says: "Kids!"
Louie says: "The Beagle Boys!"
Della says: "Hup hup hup."
Huey says: "Um, did you just become the hero of this adventure by accident?"
Dewey says: "Leave it to Mom to make the lamest adventure ever awesome."
Louie says: "Go Mom!"
Della says: "I thought you were at the fort."
Louie says: "Webby led us down here, and wait, where is she?"
Della says: "You guys stay here, and stay safe."
Della says: "I'll find her."
Louie says: "We are never going to get out of here."
Big Time says: "You got that right."
Ma Beagle says: "Ah, spiders!"
Ma Beagle says: "Big Time?"
Big Time says: "Nope, made a name for myself, Ma."
Big Time says: "I'm Bug Time, now."
Big Time says: "Heh heh heh heh heh, hiss heh heh he he heh hiss hiss."
All says: "Ugh ugh ahh!"
Webby says: "There's got to be treasure here, or a clue, or something."
Della says: "Oh, easy, Webby."
Webby says: "No, Stop."
Webby says: "I can do it myself."
Della says: "Woah, my old journal?"
Della says: "Webby, what's going on here?"
Webby says: "I've gone on some adventures, but look at everything you did by the time you were my age."
Webby says: "I could never stack up to the legend of you, but maybe if I could solve the one mystery you couldn't, the Golden Armory of Cornelious Coot."
Webby says: "except that it's just corn."
Webby says: "Corn!"
Webby says: "I dragged the boys all the way down here to find..."
Webby says: "corn."
Webby says: "I, I accomplished..."
Webby says: "corn."
Webby says: "I'm an imposter, just like Coot."
Webby says: "He was no hero, and I'm no Della Duck."
Della says: "But you did accomplish something."
Della says: "You made it farther than anyone else has."
Della says: "You don't have to be me."
Della says: "You just have to be Webby."
Della says: "And you have your own way of doing things that is unique, and special."
Della says: "You don't have to prove yourself to anyone, and oh boy."
Della says: "I should really apologize to Launchapd."
corn starts popping says: "Webby:  Coot was like a ghost, he was everywhere, and nowhere."
corn starts popping says: "His musket fire came from all directions."
Della says: "What?"
Webby says: "This "was" Coot's armory."
Webby says: "He turned his corn into popcorn, and convinced the Beagles that he was an entire army."
Webby says: "He beat them using his wits."
Della says: "Wow, I guess he was a hero in his own way."
Ma Beagle says: "Keep them away!"
Ma Beagle says: "Ah, Big Time, you moron."
Ma Beagle says: "Have you lost your durn blasted mind?"
Bug Time says: "You see how she talks to me, Turantu-Ma?"
Bug Time says: "But I got no need to impress her."
Bug Time says: "She could watch as we grab the loot."
Bug Time says: "We're gonna succeed where the Beagle Boys failed.."
Bug Time says: "nobody can stop the Buggle Boys!"
Bouncer says: "It's Coot's ghost army back to get us all."
Huey says: "Wow, the myths are true."
Della says: "Hup, get to the plane."
Dewey says: "What is that?"
Webby says: "The Golden Armory of Cornelius Coot."
Bug Time says: "Go!"
Ma Beagle says: "Ahh!"
Ma Beagle says: "Ahh!"
Ma Beagle says: "Ahh!"
Big Time says: "Quit your bellyaching, and hold your breath!"
Big Time says: "Ahh!"
Della says: "We can't back up."
Della says: "There's no way out, unless we..."
Della says: "Launchpad, do your thing."
Launchpad says: "Nibbles, give me a boost."
Launchpad says: "Everyone relax, we're about to crash."
Della says: "That actually is comforting."
Ma Beagle says: "Fine, you're back in the gang."
Bug Time says: "Oh, really Ma?"
Ma Beagle says: "Ah, don't get mushy."
Ma Beagle says: "Gugh, I got old popcorn stuck in my teeth."
Bug Time says: "Don't worry, Ma."
Bug Time says: "Them's just spider eggs."
Ma Beagle says: "Aah!"
Dewey says: "And as we burst out of that mountain heroically, I knew my name would go down in history."
Dewey says: "Dewford Turbo Coot."
Huey says: "And Coot used the farm tools as arrows to point the way."
Louie says: "Come get your commemorative Coot popcorn here."
Louie says: "It's buttery, and historical."
Louie says: "Get it before it's lost to time."
Louie says: "Coot's buttery popcorn."
Webby says: "Well, you finally got to solve the mystery of Cornelius Coot's Golden Armory."
Della says: "No, we did."
Launchpad says: "Hmm, need less spiders."
