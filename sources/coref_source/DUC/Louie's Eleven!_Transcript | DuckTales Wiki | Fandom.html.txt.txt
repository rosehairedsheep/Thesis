Episode Info says: "Transcript: Gallery: Clips: The episode starts with the Three Caballeros beginning a performance."
Donald was about to sing, but immediately gets cut by Panchito, singing the song lyrics instead of him.
Panchito says: "Hear my voice."
Panchito says: "There are things I wish you knew..."
José.
Drop the beat! Starts dancing on his own.
Panchito says: "Argh, I was getting to the good part!"
José.
Exactly! This is the good part!
Panchito tries to crash into José to stop him from dancing, but misses him. They both start fighting. Donald tries to stop them.
Donald says: "Guys!"
Donald says: "Guys!"
Donald says: "I don't think..."
The stage that was set up in Scrooge's bathroom falls apart. Scrooge is sitting in the bathtub.
Scrooge says: "Sorry, to interrupt , BUT WHY ARE YOU IN MY BATHROOM?!"
Scrooge says: "!"
José.
We wanted to give you a taste of our--.
José.
Global tour! Now, we know how busy you are...
Panchito says: "But we also know how devastated you would be if you missed out on the chance to sponsor us!"
Donald says: "We don't need money."
Panchito says: "All we need is equipment, a tour bus, a plane with our faces on it..."
Scrooge says: "Grrrr..."
José.
That's ridiculous! Scrooge is far too busy and important to go plane shopping. falls down in the tub.
Panchito says: "You're right, we'll take the money instead."
Donald says: "Fifty million, tops."
Panchito says: "A small price to pay to be a part of our band's rise to superstardom!"
Scrooge says: "DUCKWORTH!"
Duckworth turns into Demonworth and Donald chuckles nervously.
Cut to outside the front porch, Demonworth chucks the Caballeros out the door.
Demonworth says: "No solicitors!"
José.
That's the fourth rich guy's bathroom we've been kicked out of.
Panchito says: "What are we doing wrong?"
Donald says: "We just need someone to listen to us."
Louie says: "Oh, I'm listening..."
Louie says: "You wanna be famous?"
Donald says: "Uh, sure."
Panchito says: "Absolutely!"
José.
More than anything!
Louie says: "And you are willing to do whatever I say, at any cost whatsoever?"
Panchito says: "Quiet Donald!"
José.
We'll pay you two fold!
Louie says: "Then, have I got a scheme for you."
Donald says: "Ho, boy..."
Intro plays.
Cutting to later in the triplets room.
Louie says: "The fastest way to fame is Emma Glamour's IT-list."
Three Caballeros says: "Oooohhh!"
Dewey emerges from under a duvet in the second bunk.
Dewey says: "I know everything about the IT-List!"
Dewey says: "Ow."
Dewey says: "I'll get it before the IT-List comes out!"
Louie says: "Yeah, sure you do..."
Dewey falls on the floor.
José.
We must get on this blog!
Donald says: "But how?!"
Donald says: "!"
Panchito says: "Why would no one tell us?!"
Panchito says: "!"
Louie says: "Okay, bllrp, okay."
Louie says: "Just look!"
Dewey says: "--an exclusive party at the Duckburg Museum!"
Dewey says: "A night of famous people celebrating how great they are!"
Dewey says: "These..."
Dewey says: "are my people."
Dewey says: "We're going?!"
Dewey says: "!"
Louie says: "I'll get you in to that party!"
Panchito says: "We perform for Glamour!"
José.
We get on the IT-List before it's posted online!
Donald says: "Then we'll be famous throughout the planet!"
Dewey says: "Internet fame, the most important fame of all."
Donald says: "I don't know..."
Donald says: "How do we get in?"
Louie says: "Hmm..."
Louie says: "This is an exclusive party..."
Louie says: "If only someone had a super elaborate scheme to get in..."
Louie says: "Kaboom!"
Louie says: "I give you..."
Louie says: "Louie's Eleven!"
Louie says: "A multi-part, multi-person plan guaranteed to get us in..."
Louie says: "The perfect scheme."
Dewey says: "Ah, cool."
Louie says: "Please don't touch the perfect scheme!"
Dewey says: "But I know all about this party!"
Louie says: "And I know all about schemes, dear Dewford!"
Louie says: "All you have to do is listen to me..."
Louie says: "Aaand sign this legally binding contract, give me half of any money you make after you're famous."
Donald says: "WHAT?!"
Donald says: "!"
Donald says: "We can't!"
Panchito says: "I already signed for you Donald!"
José.
GIMME THE PEN!
Louie says: "All eleven have an important role."
Louie says: "I'm the team leader, obviously."
Louie says: "Caballeros, you're "The Talent"."
Dewey says: "And I'm the inside man, because I know this party in and out!"
Louie says: "What?"
Louie says: "No, but don't worry, I have a very special job just for you."
Dewey says: "Oh-ho, ho-ho-ho..."
Dewey says: "Special!"
Louie says: "This party is for invite-only, so we are gonna need..."
Huey says: "HA!"
Huey says: "And you said calligraphy camp was a waste of time!"
Louie says: "Hubert, it is perfect!"
Louie says: "Welcome to the scheme."
Huey says: "What scheme?"
Louie says: "Nothing."
Dewey says: "Tell no one!"
Louie says: "Next, we're gonna need a way to communicate all sneaky-like."
Gyro says: "Alright."
Gyro says: "These earpieces are definitely not experimental, I'm..."
Gyro says: "definitely not testing them on you, and they..."
Gyro says: "definitely won't explode in your heads if you wear them too long."
Gyro says: "Have fun at your party!"
Cuts to the Duckburg Museum.
Louie says: "And lastly, we need to figure out the party layout inside the museum, which we are doing now."
Louie says: "There's Glamour's seat and there's the stage."
Someone walks down from the stage, with orange thin legs with black heels and bow knots and a pink overcoat. The head was shown with fluffy hair and a black ribbon bow. The face is shown of a girl Duck with teal eyeshadow. She whistles with her fingers, then goes down the stage.
Daisy says: "Let's go, everyone!"
Daisy says: "We want to start fashionably late, not late late."
Daisy says: "And remember, nobody gets on stage without a stage pass."
Donald says: "Who is that?!"
Donald says: "!"
Louie says: "Ugh, Daisy Duck."
Louie says: "Glamour's personal assistant."
Louie says: "If we want to get to Glamour, we have to go through her."
While Louie observes Daisy, Donald looks at her in amazement. Daisy smiles as she looks at everything looking fine as Donald's eyes look mesmerized before he shakes it off.
Donald says: "Whatever."
Daisy says: "Nice placement on the banner, Rosa."
Daisy says: "Those shrimp puffs could be puffier, Shawn."
Daisy says: "She..."
Daisy says: "shows up."
Glamour says: "Are those..."
Glamour says: "rhododendrons?"
Daisy says: "Run, I'll handle it."
Glamour says: "You know I'm allergic to bad taste."
Daisy says: "Of course, Ms."
Daisy says: "Glamour!"
Daisy says: "I mean, who would bring rhododendrons to your party?"
Daisy says: "A rhodo-dumb-dumb?"
Glamour says: "Mmh."
Glamour says: "You have narrowly avoided ruining this party..."
Glamour says: "."
Glamour says: "for now."
Daisy says: "Oh, thank you, Ms."
Daisy says: "Glamour."
Louie says: "--Perfect."
Dewey says: "It already is."
Dewey says: "I'm gonna dance on the red carpet!"
Louie says: "No!"
Louie says: "Stick to the plan!"
Louie says: "This is "Louie's Eleven", as long as there are no surprises we'll be fine."
Percival P. Peppington says: "I swear!"
Percival P. Peppington says: "I left the invitation on the limo!"
Percival P. Peppington says: "It's parked right around the side, I'll go get it!"
Falcon Graves says: "No party crashers."
Falcon Graves says: "Wait a minute, was that..."
Falcon Graves says: "?"
Dewey says: "Why is Falcon Graves working security here?"
Dewey says: "He's gonna recognize me and now we're not invited to the party!"
José.
Maybe he won't remember you.
Dewey says: "The last time I saw him I cost him two millions of dollars and threw him off a building."
Donald says: "Oof..."
Panchito says: "That does make this harder..."
Panchito says: "New plan: Dewey's not going to the party!"
Dewey says: "Oh, WHAT?!"
Dewey says: "!"
Dewey says: "You need me in there, this is the Dewey-est party in town!"
Dewey says: "Oh, why was I cursed to be so flashy and unforgettable?"
Louie says: "Hmm..."
Louie says: "Okay, Dewey, play it cool."
DJ Daft Duck says: "C-C-C-Coolest, baby!"
DJ Daft Duck says: "Woosh!"
Graves says: "There's something familiar about you..."
Louie says: "Hey, pal!"
Louie says: "This is DJ Daft Duck, Duckburg's most electrfiying funkatronic DJ and his entourage, as you can see from our very official invitation."
Daisy says: "Graves, keep the lines moving!"
Graves says: "Welcome to the party, pal."
Dewey says: "We did it!"
Louie says: "Well, thanks to Dewey showing off, we almost got busted."
Dewey says: "WHAT?!"
Dewey says: "!"
Dewey says: "This whole party is for showing off, I know how it works."
Louie says: "No more improvising, no more showboating."
Louie says: "Everyone listens to my plan."
Panchito says: "The plan to wow Glamour with our haunting melodies."
José.
You mean our sick dance beats.
Donald says: "Guys, stop it..."
Louie says: "Look, Uncle Donald's right."
Louie says: "Earpieces in."
Louie says: "Alright, split up."
They all split up.
Louie says: "José, Panchito, head to the stage by the guard."
Panchito says: "I will charm my way on stage with my golden ways..."
Panchito says: "What are you going to do?"
Panchito says: "Dance your way past her?"
Louie says: "Easy, grown-ups."
Louie says: "You won't be able to get past the guard without..."
Louie says: "..."
Louie says: "Daisy's stage pass."
Louie says: "We've gotta distract Daisy so that Uncle Donald can steal it."
Dewey says: "So I'll dazzle Daisy with my hip and stylish yo-yo tricks."
Dewey says: "Ow."
Louie says: "Oh, that would be greaaat, Dewey."
Louie says: "but it's just not part of the plan."
Louie says: "Your very important job is coming up."
Louie says: "Jane, you're a go."
Jane says: "Yes, sir, Mr."
Jane says: "Duck."
Daisy says: "Everything is on schedule and under control."
Daisy says: "Time to party!"
Daisy says: "I'm very excited for you to see my outfit..."
Jane says: "Oh, I'm so sorry."
Glamour says: "Daisy, please."
Glamour says: "You're embarassing us both."
Glamour says: "Mostly yourself though."
Daisy says: "So sorry, I- I'll go clean up."
Louie says: "Excellent work, Jane..."
Louie says: "as always."
Louie says: "Uncle Donald, get that stage pass."
Louie says: "And now that Glamour is unguarded, I'll lay on the Louie charm."
Louie says: "Time for her to get excited for the Three Caballeros big performa-- Aw, phooey!"
Graves says: "No photographs."
Dewey says: "Grave is gonna sniff out our plan."
Dewey says: "How do we get rid of him?"
Louie says: "This is your moment."
Louie says: "The job that only you can do."
Dewey says: "AAAAAH!"
Dewey says: "This is my job?!"
Dewey says: "!"
Dewey says: "Holding a monster?!"
Dewey says: "!"
Louie says: "Not monster, team member."
Dewey says: "I could be doing more!"
Dewey says: "How is this the perfect job for me?!"
Dewey says: "!"
Louie says: "Because everyone else already have a job."
Graves says: "An intruder?"
Graves says: "Not tonight."
Daisy says: "Rassafrasin party..."
Daisy says: "Rassafrasin It-list..."
Daisy says: "HI-YAH!"
Daisy says: "This is your shot to prove yourself to Ms."
Daisy says: "Glamour..."
Daisy says: "Take it!"
Louie says: "Remember, you've got to grab the stage pass and get off, then our tenth member stop the elevator, keeping Daisy on lockdown and out of the way."
Webby says: "This party is the coolest."
Donald says: "Beautiful night, isn't it?"
Daisy says: "Kind of a terrible night, actually."
Daisy says: "What floor?"
Donald says: "Oh, uh..."
Donald says: "Whoops!"
Daisy says: "Great, not like I was in a hurry or anything."
Donald says: "Oh, sorry."
Donald says: "I'm in your space, I got it."
Louie says: "Alright, he's got it."
Louie says: "Webby, cut the elevator power."
Donald says: "Whoa!"
Daisy says: "Hang on, let me just-- Oh, you're making it worst..."
Webby says: "WEEEEE!"
Donald says: "Oh no..."
Donald says: "Oh no, oh no, oh no!"
Daisy says: "I gotta get back to the party!"
Donald says: "Someone, let us out of here!"
Daisy says: "This is all your fault!"
Donald says: "My fault?"
Donald says: "It's- Uh..."
Donald says: "It's your bag..."
Louie says: "Whoa, okay, Uncle Donald meet José and Panchito at the stage with the pass for your performance."
Louie says: "I'm going radio silent."
Donald says: "I'm gonna miss my big break!"
Daisy says: "What do you mean "big break"?"
Donald says: "My band is sort of..."
Donald says: "uh..."
Donald says: "crashing the party?"
Daisy is suddenly shocked and surprise.
Dewey says: "I'm back!"
Dewey says: "What do I do now?"
Dewey says: "Network with rich and famous?"
Dewey says: "Or I could walk the dog, eh?"
Dewey says: "What do you think?"
Louie says: "I'm going to talk to Emma Glamour to convince her how great the Caballeros are."
Louie says: "You do nothing."
Dewey says: "Come on, let me talk to Glamour."
Dewey says: "We all like the same things because she tells me what to like!"
Dewey says: "Why won't you listen to me?"
Louie says: "Because your plan is ridiculous!"
Louie says: "Come on, man, we're so close."
Louie says: "Let's just do it my way."
Yeah... okay.
Louie says: "Man, thought this place was supposed to be cool, but Three Caballeros aren't even playing."
Louie says: "Oh, hi."
Louie says: "Louie Duck, Louie's List."
Louie says: "It's like your blog, but only younger, cooler, and listier, you know, he-heh."
Glamour says: "What is your plan here exactly?"
Louie says: "I'm sorry, what?"
Glamour says: "Ooh, let me guess."
Glamour says: "You had this whole elaborate scheme to get on the IT-list and make yourself rich and famous."
Glamour says: "What do you do, manage a band or something?"
Glamour says: "Happens every year."
Glamour says: "You're nothing new."
Glamour says: "You're not original."
Glamour says: "There is nothing "IT" about you, so tell me."
Glamour says: "Why whould I ever listen to you?"
Glamour says: "Disappear now, good bye."
José.
Epa! Isso! Bonito rebola menina! Well, I've tried everything... Where is Donald and that stage pass?
Panchito says: "Oi, this is impossible!"
Panchito says: "Can no one get past these guards?"
Jane says: "I'm using the money for college."
Jane says: "I don't wanna be at Funzo's forever."
Webby says: "Why not?"
Graves says: "Ladies and gentlemen, your attention..."
Graves says: "This is a robbery."
Graves says: "Everybody stay calm."
Graves says: "Once my team has secured the museum, we can finally get what we came here for."
Louie says: "I had it all planned out!"
Louie says: "How was I supposed to know Louie's Eleven wasn't the only scheme tonight?"
Dewey says: "Wait, Louie's Eleven..."
Dewey says: "Who's number eleven?"
Louie says: "That's it!"
Louie says: "I know the plan was perfect."
Louie says: ""The Enforcer", the guy you call when everything goes bad."
Louie says: "I'll show her who's not it."
Louie says: "Number eleven..."
Louie says: "You're our last hope."
Louie says: "NO!"
Graves says: "That was odd."
Graves says: "Now, Ms."
Graves says: "Glamour, give me your phone."
Daisy says: "Almost..."
Daisy says: "Almost..."
Daisy says: "."
Daisy says: "Oh, just stay still!"
They finally managed to remove it. As Donald opens his eyes wide, he suddenly looks up at Daisy in amazement.
Daisy says: "Oh, this darn stain, seeping through my coat and onto my dress..."
Daisy removes her coat, revealing a colorful shoudlerless dress. She rubs off on it as an aurora surrounds her body. She looks at Donald.
Donald says: "Whoa, nice dress!"
Daisy says: "Ugh, not that she ever listens to me anyway."
Donald says: "Nobody listens to me either..."
Donald says: "."
Donald says: "They don't understand me."
Daisy says: "That's weird, I understand you perfectly."
Daisy says: "Well, we've got time."
Daisy says: "Alright, Mr."
Daisy says: "Big Shot, sing me something."
Hear my voice says: "There are things I wish you'de knew: For even if my heart is strange: And hard to understand: I'll give all that I have for you: I'll help you take a stand: So hear my voice: As I'm calling out for you: Hear my voice: There are things I wish you'd knew: So hear my voice..."
Hear my voice says: "."
Hear my voice.....
Hear my voice.....
Daisy says: "Get up."
Donald says: "What?"
Daisy says: "Ms."
Daisy says: "Glamour's gonna hear us both, whether she wants to or not!"
Daisy says: "What happened while we were in that elevator?!"
Daisy says: "!"
Donald says: "My kids!"
Daisy says: "Where's Ms."
Daisy says: "Glamour?!"
Daisy says: "!"
Daisy says: "Wait, you have kids?"
Glamour says: "Give that back!"
Glamour says: "I need to post a very negative review of your work on my blog."
Glamour says: "You, sir, are not IT!"
Graves says: "I don't take orders from you anymore."
Graves says: "I've stolen your precious phone, the key to your company, and sold it to the highest bidder."
Graves says: "And here..."
Graves says: "he..."
Graves says: "Oh no, not again..."
Graves says: "Not Mark Beaks!"
Beaks says: "Ho-ho, Grave-sy, long time no crime!"
Graves says: "You're the buyer?!"
Graves says: "!"
Beaks says: "Um, a phone that can make me the most buzzworthy person on the internet?"
Beaks says: "Shhya, boye!"
Glamour says: "Ugh, Marcus."
Beaks says: "HA!"
Beaks says: "Look who's gonna make the IT-List now, MOM!"
Beaks says: "Pew, pew-pew-pew-pew!"
Graves says: "Mom?!"
Graves says: "!"
Dewey says: "Huh, that actually makes a lot of sense."
Dewey says: "Okay, Lou."
Dewey says: "You're in charge, what do we do now?"
Louie says: "I don't know?"
Louie says: "I-I thought I had it all planned out, but I have no idea what I'm talking about here."
Dewey says: "But I Dew-ey!"
Louie says: "Stop, they'll grab you to!"
Dewey says: "Nerp, because I know exactly what these people want."
Dewey says: "Just listen to me for once."
Beaks says: "Oh my gosh, he's the worst!"
Beaks says: "But..."
Beaks says: "fascinating somehow?"
Graves says: "I want to look away, but I..."
Graves says: "can't..."
Gabby says: "It's grotesque..."
Louie says: "Good plan Dewey..."
Louie says: "."
Louie says: "is a thing I'd never thought I'd say!"
Glamour says: "The failure of it is ridiculous..."
Glamour says: "and beautiful!"
Glamour says: "That is IT."
Beaks says: "What?"
Beaks says: "No way, give me that phone!"
Graves says: "That's it!"
Graves says: "I'm going to take you both out and end this infuriating family once and for all!"
Daisy says: "Sorry, that's not on my party schedule."
They look up.
Donald says: "YIPPE KAY-YAY, MR."
Donald says: "FALCON!"
The phone flies into Dewey’s hand. He smiles as he runs off says: "Graves: Team!"
The phone flies into Dewey’s hand. He smiles as he runs off says: "Get that phone!"
The phone flies into Dewey’s hand. He smiles as he runs off says: "Team?"
José.
Nice singing.
Panchito says: "Nice moves."
Webby says: "Ooh, nice dagger!"
Jane says: "I gotta get outta Duckburg..."
Daisy says: "THAT'S FOR RUINING OUR BIG CHANCE!"
Daisy says: "AND THE PARTY I'VE BEEN PLANNING FOR MONTHS!"
Daisy says: "I WILL NOT BE RECOMMENDING YOUR SERVICE TO OTHERS!"
Glamour says: "DAISY!"
Glamour says: "This is YOUR fault!"
Donald says: "SO SIT DOWN!"
Manny says: "Love your blog!"
Glamour says: "No one speaks to me that way."
Daisy says: "Well, they do now!"
Glamour says: "Well, okay then."
Glamour says: "Nice dress, it's on the list."
Panchito says: "AHAAAAAAAA..."
Panchito says: "."
Donald & José.

Beaks says: "Ugh, mooooom, this party's so booorrriiiing..."
Beaks says: "..."
Beaks says: "..."
Beaks says: "."
Beaks says: "Can we goooooooooo?"
Louie says: "Well, Louie's Eleven wasn't exacly a perfect scheme."
Dewey says: "Hey, we got it to the party and survived a hostage situation."
Louie says: "Thanks to you."
Louie says: "You know, I'm actually working on a new con, and..."
Louie says: "really like to hear your advice on it."
Dewey says: ""The Dewey Dozen"?"
Dewey says: "Oh, our brotherhood is the greatest scheme of all..."
Dewey says: "."
Donald says: "Hear my voice..."
Manny says: "Hey, you're messing with my mojo!"
Donald says: "As I'm calling out to you, hear my voice..."
Donald says: "."
Dewey says: "Still, too bad the Three Caballeros didn't make the IT-List on account of Uncle Donald's voice being, you know, terrible."
Louie says: "The worst."
Daisy says: "Oh, I don't know."
Daisy says: "I can listen to it allll night..."
