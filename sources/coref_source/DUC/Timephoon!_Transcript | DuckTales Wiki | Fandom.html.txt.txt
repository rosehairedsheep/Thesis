Episode opens with a shot of Killmotor Hill in the middle of a storm.
Roxanne says: "Here in Duckburg, life is like..."
Roxanne says: "a hurricane?"
Roxanne says: "Residents are battening down the hatches for the worst El Pato storm in decades."
Dewey and Webby pass the cans to a pile.
Dewey says: "Hey, Louie?"
Louie says: "AAAH!"
Louie says: "What?"
Webby says: "Can you give us a hand?"
They laugh, Louie pats Webby.
Dewey says: "All right, okay, eheheh."
Webby says: "Nope!"
Beakley says: "Mr."
Beakley says: "Chunky's Extra Chunky Chili Chunks?"
Dewey says: "We could be stuck here for days."
Dewey says: "You said we we should get plenty of food we won't get sick of."
Beakley says: "I said won't get sick from, and you know it."
Della says: "What?"
Della says: "Chilli cheese dogs put the "hooray" in "hooraycane party", it's no big deal!"
Beakley says: "Until we're on day 8 with nothing but chili cheese dogs and we all get scurvy..."
Beakley says: "."
Beakley says: "again."
Della says: "Beakley!"
Della says: "You gotta let kids be kids, don't sweat the small stuff."
Beakley says: "Is this your parenting strategy or things you read off a bumper sticker?"
Della says: "Honk if you're a great mom!"
Della says: "Honk honk!"
Louie says: "NOTHING, I SWEAR!"
Louie says: "Heeeey, Hue!"
Louie says: "W-why don't you tell everybody what you're up to in great length?"
Huey says: "I'm almost done with my comprehensive report on cave ducks!"
Huey says: "After months of research, I've written my masterpiece."
Huey says: "This is my chance to get an entry into..."
Huey says: "."
Huey says: "the new addition of the Junior Woochuck Guidebook."
Dewey says: "My brother's gonna be a professional nerd."
Scrooge says: "We need to bring in all these valuable heirlooms for the garage before the storm hits."
Louie says: "I'm sorry, "valuable"?"
Scrooge says: "These are the famous canes of Clan McDuck, going aaall the way back to our very earliest ancestors."
Louie says: "Oh..."
Louie says: "."
Louie says: "sentimental value, yuck!"
Louie says: "Anyway, I've got important- Uuuh, stuff, to take care of..."
Louie says: "in..."
Louie says: "my room..."
Louie says: ".."
Louie says: "so..."
Louie says: "mm."
Scrooge says: "That boy's up to something..."
Launchpad says: "Whoops."
Scrooge says: "Launchpad, euh..."
Scrooge says: "wh- why don't you keep an eye of Louie upstairs?"
Scrooge says: "Far away from here."
Launchpad says: "No problem, Mr."
Launchpad says: "McDee."
Launchpad says: "Hey, Louie, wait up!"
Launchpad says: "Louie?"
Louie says: "Launchpad, I can explain..."
Launchpad says: "You've got your own tub?!"
Launchpad says: "!"
Launchpad says: "Lucky."
Intro plays.
Louie says: "Step in to the future of treasure hunting: the past."
Louie says: "Borrowing Gyro's time tub here, the keen minds at Louie Incorporated can track down famous lost treasure at the exact moment before they were lost!"
Caveduck says: "Ho..."
Caveduck says: "Bubba!"
Louie says: "No risking time, resources, or you know, our lives,  navigating dangerous temples filled with curses and booby traps like this poor fellow."
Louie says: "And because these treasures were never found, taking them doesn't effect the time stream."
Louie says: "Just  bwamp to the past, take the artifact..."
Louie says: "."
Louie says: "..."
Louie says: "and return to home a little bit richer."
Louie says: "Time Treasures, a subsidiary of Louie Inc."
Louie says: "It's not a crime if it's lost at time."
Louie says: "Any questions?"
Louie says: "Keeping in mind, again, that it is not a real tub and cannnot be used for bubble baths."
Huey says: "..."
Huey says: "and so the simple caveduck gave way to more advanced..."
Webby says: "What was that?"
Dewey says: "I think I see something out there."
Dewey says: "Let's check it out."
Scrooge says: "Come back, the storm is starting!"
Della says: "Eeeeh what are they gonna find out there, a little rain?"
Della says: "Some debris?"
Dewey says: "Hey, cool, a dead guy!"
Huey says: "A caveduck..."
Huey says: "."
Webby says: "Aww..."
Webby says: "Hey, little guy."
Dewey says: "Ooh, maybe he was frozen on an iceberg..."
Webby says: "..."
Webby says: "and the iceberg melted and he was washed ashore with the storm!"
Scrooge says: "Yeah, pffffft..."
Scrooge says: "."
Scrooge says: "frozen in an iceberg."
Scrooge says: "Preposterous!"
Webby says: "It happened to you twice."
Huey says: "A real..."
Huey says: "."
Huey says: "life..."
Huey says: "."
Huey says: "CAVEDUCK?!"
Huey says: "!"
Huey says: "He could prove my report is accurate to the Junior Woochuck Council and guarantee my entry gets in the new guidebook!"
Della says: "Great!"
Beakley says: "Aaaand possibly disrupt all of time."
Della says: "Aww..."
Della says: "."
Della says: "But it's one little caveduck."
Beakley says: "Small problems can turn into big problems if not prevented early."
Beakley says: "Step a butterfly in the past..."
Beakley says: "..."
Della says: "Duuuude, why would you step on a butterfly?"
Della says: "That's sick, lady."
Della says: "Sick!"
Beakley says: "It's a hypotethical situation."
Della says: "Good!"
Della says: "Keep it that way."
Della says: "Kids, take him to the TV room before the butterfly basher here gets to him."
Scrooge says: "We'll deal with these crisis in order of importance."
Scrooge says: "Strange storm first, caveduck second."
Huey says: "History's alive!"
Huey says: "I made this shelter based on cave paintings from your time!"
Huey says: "I couldn't find any "mastodon fur, so I iiiimprovised."
Huey says: "Just like home, huh?"
Huey says: "No, you're right."
Huey says: "Cozy blankets are no substitute for mastodon fur."
Huey says: "Hey!"
Webby says: "Hahaha!"
Webby says: "He's got a hat like a person."
Dewey says: "Webby, please."
Dewey says: "This is serious."
Dewey says: "Be-be-be-bew, bew, bew!"
Huey says: "Duckus lopithicus is not a joke!"
Huey says: "He doesn't understand your funky fresh ways."
Huey says: "I've reconstructed some rudimentary caveduck language."
Huey says: "Ooh!"
Huey says: "Ooga!"
Huey says: "Ah!"
Huey says: "Ah!"
Huey says: "Aaaah?!"
Huey says: "!"
Caveduck says: "Ba, ba, Bubba!"
Webby says: "Maybe Bubba is his name."
Webby says: "Hi, I'm Wabba!"
Huey says: "That's ridiculous."
Huey says: "He can't understand modern language, Webby."
Huey says: "I'll offer him some tree bark and leaves as a piece offering."
Bubba says: "Mmm..."
Bubba says: "."
Bubba says: "Bubba grubba."
Huey says: "Caveducks."
Huey says: "Do not."
Huey says: "Eat."
Huey says: "Cheese dogs!"
Dewey says: "They do now!"
Webby says: "Man, I am learning so much!"
Huey says: "Here, here!"
Huey says: "at least try the bark!"
Louie says: "Ah, the problem with being this succesfl is finding enough closets to hide your loot."
Louie says: "Eheheh."
Launchpad says: "So we're not doing anything worng because we're finding lost treasures, but before they were lost."
Launchpad says: "So we're finding..."
Launchpad says: "."
Launchpad says: "found treasures?"
Launchpad says: "Isn't that..."
Launchpad says: "."
Launchpad says: "stealing?"
Louie says: "First of all, those pirates never reclaim their treasures."
Louie says: "And also, they were pirates!"
Louie says: "Doesn't it just break your heart to think of all this treasure?"
Louie says: "Alone?"
Louie says: "In the ground?"
Louie says: "Unloved?"
Launchpad says: "So it's kinda like we're saving it?"
Louie says: "It is exactly like that."
Louie says: "I have plan for every possibility."
Louie says: "There is no way the Time Treasure, a subsidiary of Louie Inc, has any side effect whatsoever!"
Huey says: "He shouldn't be exposed to wheels..."
Huey says: "for another 10000 years!"
Dewey says: "Louie!"
Dewey says: "We got a new brother!"
Dewey says: "He's a caveduck."
Dewey says: "and his name is Bubba."
Louie says: "I'm sorry, what's his now?"
Dewey says: "Wanna hear his theme song?"
Dewey says: "Bubba, bubba..."
Dewey says: "that's all I've got."
Bubba says: "Bubba..."
Bubba says: "."
Bubba says: "flubba?"
Dewey says: "Ooh, that's good!"
Dewey says: "Lyrical genius this guy."
Beakley says: "Della, clearly you can see there is a problem here?"
Della says: "Kids."
Della says: "If you're gonna let the caveduck skateboard in the house, he should be wearing a helmet."
Della says: "Problem solved, good parenting Della."
Bubba says: "Bubba tuba!"
Bubba says: "Bubba tuba!"
Webby says: "Ooooh, what does tubba mean?"
Louie says: "Oh, nothing..."
Louie says: "hehe, it's just caveduck nonsense, ehehe..."
Louie says: "Shut uppa, man."
Launchpad says: "If the caveduck is here, are we in the past?!"
Launchpad says: "!"
Louie says: "Don't think about it too hard, okay?"
Louie says: "It's one little caveduck."
Louie says: "This will have no effect on the timeline..."
Louie says: "probably."
Launchpad says: "Hey, it's those pirates!"
Louie says: "Okay, it might have a tiny effect on the timeline."
