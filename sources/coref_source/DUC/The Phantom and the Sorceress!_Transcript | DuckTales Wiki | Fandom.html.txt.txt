Episode Info says: "Transcript: Gallery: Clips: The episode commences with a shot of Scrooge comfortably carrying a tray of tea."
Episode Info says: "He also has a newspaper under his arm."
Episode Info says: "He enters the living room and stops walking."
Episode Info says: "He kicks a computer hard drive aside, sets his tea tray down and sits down to read his newspaper, the Woolstreet Journal on which some read "Shearholders RejectedÂ " and "Lorem Ipsum Stone finally translated"."
Suddenly children yells are heard and Scrooge peaks his head out at the tv screen showing their copy of Legends of LegendQuest Dereznaroth. Scrooge's eye lids lift, and a split second after, the children including Lena and Violet fly through the TV screen with the Nightmare Beast peering out.
Lena says: "Back!"
Lena says: "Get back!"
Dewey says: "You'll never take us alive."
Scrooge says: "Let me guess."
Scrooge says: "You started playing this video-graphical game."
Huey says: "Legends of Legend Quest."
Scrooge says: "And then, someone made a wish around Lena,  and the game became real."
Scrooge says: "Hup."
Dewey says: "Uh, game over!"
Louie says: "Boo!"
Lena says: "Ugh."
Lena says: "This amulet is ruining my life."
Webby says: "It's okay, Lena."
Webby says: "We'll just add playing video games to the list of things that trigger your magic."
Lena says: "Everything triggers my stupid magic."
Violet says: "Making a list."
Lena says: "Bad amulet!"
Lena says: "Bad!"
Scrooge says: "You kids should know by now that nothing good has ever come from magic."
Boys says: "Ugh."
Boys says: "Uh-uh."
Scrooge says: "Hey, except you, Lena."
Scrooge says: "You're one of the good..."
Scrooge says: "magical things I've dealt with."
Scrooge says: "Yeah."
Lena says: "Hey I know I'm great, It's magic that's the problem."
Della says: "Hey, Uncle Scrooge?"
Della says: "Real quick, there is a floating goat in your closet that needs your help?"
Scrooge says: "The mystical kingdom of Goat'hool must be under attack again."
Scrooge says: "Great, more magic."
Scrooge says: "Again, no offense."
Scrooge says: "Alright kids, time to head off into another realm."
Kids says: "Woo whoo, Yeah!"
Lena says: "I'm pretty sure my stupid magic would just make the situation worse."
Webby says: "Oh."
Webby says: "Well, if you don't want to go, neither do we, right Violet?"
Violet says: "I suppose we could have just as much fun exploring the complex realm of interpersonal relationships."
Lena says: "As if ruining my life wasn't bad enough, now you're ruining my friend's lives too."
Webby says: "Oh, don't listen to her."
Webby says: "She just needs to learn how to control you better."
Lena says: "Or I could just rid of you."
Webby says: "Lena, magic is an important part of who you are."
Webby says: "You can't just throw it away."
Violet says: "Maybe we should just stop having sleepovers."
Webby says: "Maybe you should rethink that sentence."
Lena says: "Okay, I think were all tired."
Lena says: "Come on, let's just go get some sleep before some crazy magical nonsense wakes us up again, and forces us to deal with it."
opening theme says: "A moaning sound is heard at the door."
Lena says: "Ugh, here we go again."
Webby says: "You're expecting vampires?"
Violet says: "Statistically speaking, we're due."
Gladstone says: "Uncle Scrooge, I need you, ugh!"
Webby says: "Stand down, Violet, It's just Donald's lucky loafer of a cousin Gladstone."
Lena says: "Um, if he's so lucky, why is he crying?"
Gladstone says: "Because the world is broken."
Gladstone says: "It happened last night."
Gladstone says: "I had just been given a ride by a jet who needed help breaking in his new stretch limo."
Gladstone says: "I was feeling peckish, and a little drained."
Gladstone says: "I found myself outside an all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet, and I screamed with joy because I love shrimp."
Gladstone says: "I strolled inside to be named the one thousandth customer and awarded a free meal, but get this."
Gladstone says: "No confetti or balloons?"
Gladstone says: "I asked for food, and you know what they asked for in return?"
Gladstone says: "Payment."
Gladstone says: "I opened my wallet."
Gladstone says: "It was empty."
Gladstone says: "Not twenty dollar bill conveniently flew in either, so I had to go to a bank, but it was closed?"
Gladstone says: "Did you know things could be closed?"
Gladstone says: "So I went to the ATM around the corner and asked it for twenty dollars, and you know how much it gave me?"
Lena says: "Twenty dollars?"
Gladstone says: "Yeah."
Gladstone says: "Not the usual accidental sack of rubies."
Gladstone says: "That's when I knew something was up, and I needed Uncle Scrooge to fix it."
Gladstone says: "Ugh, I had to "walk" here."
Gladstone says: "It took hours."
Gladstone says: "No one offered me a ride, no passing hang glider scooped me up, and not one gust of wind whimsically carried me."
Gladstone says: "Is this what life is like for you people?"
Gladstone says: "Ugh, ow!"
Gladstone says: "Why weren't there pillows there?"
Lena says: "Wow, I was expecting something more magical and less..."
Lena says: "pathetic."
Webby says: "That came from Uncle Scrooge's room."
Gladstone says: "How do you guys do anything on the second floor?"
Webby says: "The portal to Goat'hool!"
A dark figure drains the portal of its energy.
All says: "Aaahhh!"
Gladstone says: "Oh."
dark figure says: "You!"
Webby says: "Huh, yah!"
Webby damages the figure's glove.
Gladstone says: "Ahh!"
Gladstone says: "Ow!"
dark figure says: "It wasn't enough."
Gladstone says: "Why?"
Webby says: "Who was that?"
Webby says: "He closed the portal to Goat'hool."
Violet says: "And he went after Lena's magical amulet."
Violet says: "Perhaps he attacked Gladstone because his luck is a type of magic as well."
Gladstone says: "Who would do this to me?"
Violet says: "The Phantom Blot."
Lena says: "The Phantom what?"
Violet says: "Any well-read student of the supernatural knows of the Phantom Blot."
Violet says: "He's a thief."
Violet says: "A magic hunter."
Webby says: "Wow, Violet."
Webby says: "From one journaler to another, these drawings are amazing."
Violet says: "Indeed."
Violet says: "Phantom Blot hates magic, and thinks it's dangerous."
Violet says: "Wherever the Blot goes, all magic disappears, and now he's come for us."
Violet says: "End of presentation."
Lena says: "Wait, if magic goes away, what happens to me?"
Webby says: "He's trapped my family."
Webby says: "He's coming for my best friend."
Violet says: "And once he fixes that glove, he'll be back."
Lena says: "Great, so once again, my life is in danger because magic."
Webby says: "We must protect you at all costs."
Gladstone says: "And more importantly, Gladstone."
Violet says: "The best magical defense is a good magical offense."
Violet says: "We fight back."
Lena says: "But I can't control it."
Webby says: "Then we'll have to go to someone who can teach you how."
Lena says: "Oh no."
Lena says: "No no nonononononono!"
Lena says: "No!"
Phantom Blot says: "Must be stronger."
Phantom Blot says: "There."
Pepper says: "Ahem, oh so sorry to bother you Mr."
Pepper says: "Blot."
Pepper says: "Oh, you're busy."
Pepper says: "I'll come back."
Lena says: "Ugh hah, as if asking for help from the person I hate the most wasn't bad enough, I have to walk through gross bog water to get to her."
Violet says: "There's also a high possibility of a swamp gator attack."
Webby says: "Oooh!"
Gladstone says: "Ugh, this bog is so deep."
Gladstone says: "How did you know where to step?"
Gladstone says: "Ugh!"
Gladstone says: "Ugh!"
Lena says: "I think this might be the place."
Violet says: "How can you tell?"
Magica says: "Hang on, hang on!"
Magica says: "Who's there?"
Violet says: "It's Violet Saberwing?"
Magica says: "Who?"
Webby says: "She's with me, Webby Vanderquack?"
Magica says: "Who?"
Lena says: "It's Lena, your niece."
Magica says: "Lena!"
Magica says: "Give me the amulet!"
Webby says: "She's very strong for a bog woman."
Magica says: "Give me back my amulet!"
Lena says: "It's not yours."
Lena says: "It's mine, and so are your stupid powers for all the good they do me."
Magica says: "Cool, then give them back."
Magica says: "Mm, now you're susceptible to vampires!"
Magica says: "Muah ha ha ha haha!"
Magica says: "Now seriously, what do you want with me?"
Lena says: "If it were up to me, I'd be as far from you as possible."
Magica says: "Already heard that one."
Magica says: "Don't you have any new material?"
Magica says: "Perhaps something about how you're a disgrace to our family legacy, and a complete magical failure, so you've decided it's best to just give me my amulet?"
Lena says: "Forget it."
Lena says: "I don't need her or her dumb legacy."
Lena says: "I'll face Phantom Blot and his stupid glove myself."
Magica says: "Phantom Blot?"
Magica says: "Inside, quickly."
Magica says: "What part of "quickly" don't you get?"
Magica says: "Decades ago before I had to deal with the likes of you, I used my magic to lord over a country village."
Magica says: "One day, I grew tired of the many gifts the villagers offered me to keep me from destroying their village."
Magica says: "So I destroyed their village."
Magica says: "One of the survivors proclaimed to put an end to magic, and came after me like dozens before."
Magica says: "But this one was different."
Magica says: "He used various devices meant to steal my powers."
Magica says: "Obviously he failed, but each time he got better, stronger."
Magica says: "The last time we faced off, I barely escaped with my magic and my life."
Magica says: "Any questions?"
Gladstone says: "Um, yes."
Gladstone says: "Gladstone Gander."
Gladstone says: "When do you stop talking about whatever this is, and give me my luck back?"
Magica says: "I can't."
Gladstone says: "Uh huh huh okay, Gladstone out."
Violet says: "That glove he's using must be some sort of magical draining device."
Lena says: "You really outdid yourself this time."
Lena says: "Phantom Blot is after me because he thinks I'm you."
Lena says: "Your magic isn't a legacy."
Lena says: "It's a curse."
Magica says: "Sure, blame the witch."
Magica says: "How original."
Magica says: "You are a little shadow creature, and have no chance against him."
Magica says: "Give me the amulet!"
Violet says: "There is another option."
Webby says: "Come on Lena."
Webby says: "Just ask her."
Magica says: "Ask me what?"
Lena says: "I have nothing to say to her."
Magica says: "Tell Lena, I'm glad because I'm not talking to her, and I'd never teach her how to defeat the Blot anyway."
Lena says: "I'm glad she won't help me use my powers to defeat Blot because I never asked her to."
Magica says: "Is that right?"
Magica says: "Well, tell Lena if she doesn't want my help, I want to hear it from her own pitiful lips."
Webby says: "Look, I don't like this any more than you do, but my family is missing."
Webby says: "You could be gone next."
Webby says: "And if you learn to control your powers, I know you can use them for good."
Lena says: "Ugh, fine."
Lena says: "Will you train me to use my magic to defeat Blot?"
Magica says: "It wont be easy."
Magica says: "There will be trials, tribulations."
Lena says: "Well, if you think it's too hard, then."
Magica says: "No, no, no, no."
Magica says: "Don't leave."
Magica says: "I'll do it."
Gladstone says: "I've never had to use a doorknob before."
Magica says: "May I remind you that magic is not laughter and good times, or did you forget that a masked menace is coming to destroy us all while Scrooge is stuck in a trap not of my own making."
Magica says: "If you're just going to goof around then give me the- Ahh!"
Lena says: "Hey, why is the color of my magic blue sometimes?"
Magica says: "It's the color of your personal magic signature."
Magica says: "All sorcerers have one."
Magica says: "Mine is a vastly superior malevolent purple."
Magica says: "Here, I'll prove it."
Magica says: "Give me the amulet."
Lena says: "You are exhausting, you know that?"
Magica says: "Relax, it's all part of the training."
Lena says: "We don't."
Violet says: "We don't."
Webby says: "We don't."
Magica says: "Then give the amulet to Pinky, over here."
Webby says: "We met several times."
Magica says: "Give her the amulet so she can try to blast you with it."
Magica says: "If you've learned anything today, you'll block it."
Lena says: "But I can't do magic without it."
Magica says: "Oh, Lena, will you ever cease to be wrong?"
Magica says: "The amulet allows you to harness my magic, but unfortunately you have some of your own."
Webby says: "It's like I told you, Lena."
Webby says: "You're made of magic."
Magica says: "You should be able to use your silly, disgusting, blue friendship magic to slightly divert my obviously-better-than-yours, evil, purple magic."
Violet says: "I'll do it."
Violet says: "What?"
Violet says: "It's purely for academic purposes."
Magica says: "Ready?"
Magica says: "Blast her!"
Lena says: "Ugh!"
Lena says: "Oof, ugh!"
Magica says: "No, no, you lost."
Magica says: "How unpredictable."
Lena says: "That wasn't fair."
Lena says: "I wasn't ready."
Magica says: "Right, that's it."
Magica says: "It wasn't because you're never focused."
Lena says: "Oh, I'm never focused."
Lena says: "Guess I'll show you focused."
Magica says: "Yes, good."
Magica says: "Now channel your hate for me and go!"
Lena says: "Uagh!"
Magica says: "Oh, woof!"
Magica says: "Even the girl without magic did better than that: Violet: To be fair, I'm a quick study."
Webby says: "Being angry might work for Magica, but you're not her."
Webby says: "You're good, so focus on good magical things like a unicorn, or the shiny silver beard of a wise old wizard."
Webby says: "The classic fire of a phoenix, the sound of a child's laughter, crystal."
Lena says: "Okay, Webby, I got it."
Lena says: "Thanks."
Lena says: "Uagh!"
Lena says: "Woah, come on Vi!"
Webby says: "Boo!"
Webby says: "Bad form."
Violet says: "That wasn't me."
Violet says: "You know I'd never breach duel protocol."
Gladstone says: "Ugh, oohhh."
Phantom Blot says: "De Spell!"
Gladstone says: "I'm so sorry."
Phantom Blot says: "Your magic, and your menace end here, Witch!"
Magica says: "Don't forget who you're dealing with, Blot."
Magica says: "I am the sorceress of the shadows!"
Magica says: "Behold my power!"
Magica says: "Oohh!"
Magica says: "Ooh!"
Magica says: "Ah!"
Magica says: "So many colors, so much power!"
Magica says: "Ooh, will it ever end?"
Magica says: "Pick a card, any card!"
Phantom Blot says: "You destroyed my village, and my family, and now I'll destroy you, and yours!"
Violet says: "Lena!"
Violet says: "Catch!"
Lena says: "Quick!"
Lena says: "Get his glove off!"
Webby says: "This is for Lena!"
Webby says: "And this one's for my family!"
Webby says: "And this one's for Lena!"
Violet says: "Stop saying who it's for, and get his glove!"
Magica says: "Lena, make yourself useful!"
Lena says: "Huh, ah!"
Lena says: "Hah!"
Webby says: "Ngah!"
Webby says: "Hah!"
Webby says: "Ugh!"
Phantom Blot says: "Ughah!"
Magica says: "Delicious peanut brittle?"
Magica says: "Psyche."
Magica says: "It's snakes!"
Lena says: "No, now it's a snake!"
Phantom Blot says: "Ow!"
Webby says: "Go get reinforcements, little guy!"
Violet says: "You can talk to snakes?"
Webby says: "I hope so!"
Phantom Blot says: "Ugh!"
Phantom Blot says: "Enough!"
Magica says: "That all you got, punk?"
Lena says: "Vi, Webby, are you okay?"
Lena says: "Ah!"
Lena says: "Ah!"
Lena says: "Stop!"
Lena says: "Please!"
Lena says: "If you destroy this."
Phantom Blot says: "I destroy you!"
Lena resists Phantom Blots drain and the amulet flies up in the air.
Lena says: "Gladstone!"
Gladstone says: "Huh?"
Gladstone says: "I got it."
Gladstone says: "You can do this, Gladstone, succeed on your own merits."
Gladstone says: "Ow!"
Gladstone says: "Ha hah!"
Gladstone says: "I did it!"
Lena says: "Whew."
Gladstone says: "Better luck next time, Blotty, hah!"
Gladstone says: "Oh!"
Gladstone says: "Augh!"
Gladstone says: "Ugh!"
Magica says: "No, my magic!"
Magica says: "and Lena."
Magica says: "Concentrate on where the magic comes from."
flashback says: "Magica: I am the dark force at the core of all things."
flashback says: "Did you think you turn out different than me?"
flashback says: "Lena couldn't be your friend because she was never real!"
Webby says: "Forget her magic."
Webby says: "Where does your magic come from?"
flashback says: "Lena: you want to blow it up, don't you?"
flashback says: "pew!"
Webby says: "pew pew pew pew!"
Webby says: "Looks like someone's a hugger after all."
Webby says: "Best Friends!"
Lena says: "Uagh!"
Lena says: "Uagh!"
Lena says: "Ah!"
Phantom Blot says: "How is this possible?"
Lena says: "Because our magic is the greatest magic of all."
Webby says: "Woo hoo!"
Magica says: "Gross."
Phantom Blot says: "Then I'll take that magic and destroy it too."
Phantom Blot says: "Uagh!"
Lena says: "Augh!"
Webby says: "Lena!"
Violet says: "We're with you!"
Lena says: "Grrr."
Phantom Blot says: "Ugh!"
Phantom Blot says: "Ugh!"
Phantom Blot says: "It's too..."
Phantom Blot says: "much..."
Phantom Blot says: "magic!"
Lena says: "Hey Blot!"
Lena says: "You want magic?"
Lena says: "Well, here you go."
Lena says: "Uagh!"
Phantom Blot says: "Uagh!"
Gladstone says: "Hey, twenty dollars, and another, and another!"
Gladstone says: "Ha ha ha."
Phantom Blot says: "Ugh!"
Phantom Blot says: "What?"
Webby says: "I "can" talk to snakes!"
Phantom Blot says: "Ugh!"
Lena says: "That's right!"
Lena says: "Not in my house!"
Lena says: "Or outside my shadow aunts mud-hut-looking house."
Lena says: "The point is I win!"
Webby says: "Huzzah!"
Violet says: "Huzzah!"
Webby says: "Woo hoo."
Violet says: "Woo hoo."
Webby says: "Magic is back!"
Violet says: "Magic is back!"
Magica says: "Yes, it is."
Magica says: "Mwa ha ha ha ha!"
Magica says: "Thanks for returning my amulet, Lena."
Magica says: "I'll treasure it always."
Magica says: "Oh, it's good to be back."
Magica says: "Now where was I?"
Magica says: "Ah yes, enacting some sweet revenge!"
Magica says: "Take notes, Nerds!"
Magica says: "Ugh!"
Magica says: "Excuse you?!"
Magica says: "!"
Magica says: "I brought you into this world, you insufferable brat!"
Lena says: "And I intend to protect it from people like you, thanks to your training."
Magica says: "You're welcome!"
Magica says: "But I didn't teach you this!"
Magica says: "Uah?!"
Magica says: "!"
Magica says: "Uagh!"
Gladstone says: "It appears magic is in the air."
Magica says: "Put me down!"
Magica says: "Ugagh!"
Magica says: "My staff!"
Magica says: "My staff!"
Magica says: "Ugh!"
Lena says: "I'm not in your shadow anymore."
Lena says: "This magic is my legacy now, and I'm gonna use it for good."
Webby says: "Looks like you're not the only sorceress in town anymore."
Girls says: "Woo hoo!"
Girls says: "Ha ha ha."
Dewey says: "How long were we gone?"
Huey says: "Feels like a lifetime."
Louie says: "So, what did we miss?"
Lena says: "Ah, not much."
Girls says: "Ha ha ha ha ha."
