Launchpad says: "This is the city of St."
Launchpad says: "Canard."
Launchpad says: "A metropolis overrun with the worst kind of crime: Super Crime."
Dewey says: "Oncoming traffic!"
The limousine swerves around.
Scrooge says: "Sorry Bradford."
Scrooge says: "Bit of unexpected turbulence."
Scrooge says: "All fine now."
Bradford says: "All would be better if you weren't wasting time and money on this trip."
Bradford says: "After that string of accidents, our Saint Canard research facility is a lost cause."
Scrooge says: "Doctor Bulba may be a bit unorthodox, but his lab is cutting edge."
Scrooge says: "If he says he's on to something big, I trust him."
Huey says: "His latest project is supposed to be revolutionary."
Louie says: "Profitable."
Bradford says: "Reckless."
Bradford says: "Mr McDuck, Bulba's experiments are worthless pipe dreams."
Bradford says: "Better not to deal with him."
Scrooge says: "Yes, fine, thank you Bradford."
Scrooge says: "Short-sighted old buzzard."
Scrooge says: "There's no reward without a little risk."
Scrooge says: "Bradford doesn't know how things work."
Bradford says: "I'm still on the phone."
Scrooge says: "I don't know how it works."
Scrooge says: "Someone shut this blasted thing off."
Huey says: "Hurry, Launchpad."
Huey says: "A bold new scientific horizon awaits."
Dewey says: "Me and LP don't have time for "nerd" stuff."
Dewey says: "I scored an exclusive interview with Launchpad's pal, Drake, that is sure to boost my online viewership."
Dewey says: "We're talking 20, maybe even 25 viewers."
Louie says: "Why would Launchpad's weird buddy boost your ratings?"
Launchpad says: "Ah, dunno."
Launchpad says: "He's just a real "super" guy."
Launchpad and Dewey chuckles.
Dewey says: "Yeah, when the chips are down, he really knows how to "get dangerous"."
Launchpad and Dewey chuckles again.
Louie says: "So this Drake guy is Darkwing Duck."
Dewey says: "What?"
Launchpad says: "What?"
Dewey says: "Nooooo?"
Launchpad says: "Nooooo?"
Dewey says: "Nice."
Launchpad says: "You're so good at secrets."
Darkwing says: "Oh no!"
Darkwing says: "No!"
Darkwing says: "Come on!"
Darkwing says: "Why?!"
Darkwing says: "!"
Darkwing says: "Gah!"
Darkwing says: "Ah!!"
Taurus Bulba says: "Scrooge McDuck."
Taurus Bulba says: "What a momentous honor."
Taurus Bulba says: "Ooh, let's take a picture."
Scrooge says: "The pleasure is mine, Bulba."
Taurus says: "Ah, call me Taurus, or Terry, or whatever you want."
Taurus says: "You're Scrooge McDuck."
Taurus says: "Ah ha ha."
Taurus says: "And you must be Huey."
Huey says: "You know me?"
Taurus says: "Junior Woodchuck Robotics Champion four years running?"
Taurus says: "I'd hire you right now if you weren't too short for the lab coats."
Taurus says: "And Louie, huge fan of Louie Inc."
Taurus says: "Groundbreaking stuff, young man."
Louie says: "We were really doing good work until a monster tried to kill me."
Taurus says: "You know, I have a grizzled old monster after my money too, but enough about Bradford."
Taurus says: "Ha ha HA!"
Taurus says: "But even he couldn't say no to our top secret project."
Taurus says: "It promises to change the world."
Huey says: "Change the world?"
Huey says: "Is it a terraformer?"
Louie says: "Hubert, please."
Louie says: "Don't pester the man who's going to make me- us- Scrooge rich."
Taurus says: "Ha ha ha."
Taurus says: "Wonderful question."
Scrooge says: "I have one myself."
Scrooge says: "I'm eager to see what you've been working on."
Scrooge says: "I'd heard reports of some rather costly setbacks in your lab of late."
Taurus says: "Ah yes, of course."
Taurus says: "There's no reward without a little risk."
Taurus says: "But first, I will need something from you."
Everyone says: "Hm?"
Taurus says: "The most powerful force in the world."
Taurus says: "A childlike sense of wonder."
Huey says: "Mr."
Huey says: "Bulba, I take it with me everywhere I go."
Huey says: "Woo hoo, yeah."
Louie says: "Woo hoo, yeah."
Launchpad says: "Hello?"
Launchpad says: "DW?"
Dewey says: "Maybe we got the wrong abandoned tower."
Darkwing says: "I am the terror that flaps in the night."
Darkwing says: "I am the toddler kicking the front seat of crime."
Darkwing says: "I am- oof."
Dewey says: "Is that motorcycle your face?"
Launchpad says: "Drake!"
Darkwing says: "Oh hey!"
Darkwing says: "LP!"
Launchpad says: "This is amazing!"
Launchpad says: "First you love Darkwing, then you played Darkwing, now you are Darkwing."
Launchpad says: "This is like every dream I've ever had, only my hands aren't made of waffles, right?"
Launchpad says: "Aw!"
Dewey says: "Do these costumes come in junior sizes?"
Dewey says: "Are these smoke bombs?"
Dewey says: "They are!"
Dewey says: "Smoke bomb, smoke bomb!"
Dewey says: "Oh ho ho ho ho!"
Dewey says: "Shiny!"
Darkwing says: "Launchpad's pal Fenton hooked me up."
Darkwing says: "His talents are wasted designing doodads for that hack, Gizmoduck."
Darkwing says: "Between you, me, and the motorcycle, Fenton can't stand the guy."
Launchpad says: "I can't believe we're actually going to fight actual crime with the actual Darkwing Duck!"
Launchpad says: "On the old TV show, Darkwing faced the vilest villains imaginable: Bushroot, Quackerjack, Megavolt, Liquidator."
Darkwing says: "Well, those are fictional villains from the old TV shows."
Launchpad says: "So your real-life villains must be even more impressive."
Darkwing says: "Oh sure yeah, about that."
Dewey says: "Yes, on-location live-stream crime fighting."
Dewey says: "Computer, crimes, where are they?"
WANDA says: "Displaying map of Saint Canard."
Dewey says: "There's no crimes."
Dewey says: "Saint Canard is supposed to be the supervillain capital of the world."
WANDA says: "Not since the new mayor took charge and cleaned up the place."
Dewey says: "Hrmph."
Launchpad says: "Computer, are you sure?"
WANDA says: "Sorry, which of us has a sophisticated auto intelligence?"
WANDA says: "Oh, right, it's me, the big computer."
WANDA says: "There's no crime."
Darkwing says: "But there was so much, you just missed it."
Dewey says: "Oh man, without a superhero fight, this docu-drama is gonna lack docu and drama."
Darkwing says: "Alright, you wanna fight crime?"
Darkwing says: "Let's get dangerous."
Taurus says: "This..."
Taurus says: "is..."
Taurus says: "the future!"
Taurus says: "Gentlemen, I give you..."
Taurus says: "the ramrod!"
Taurus says: "Should have put a tarp over it for a dramatic reveal."
Scrooge says: "Ohho, this is really something."
Scrooge says: "What is this exactly?"
Taurus says: "The reality altering mechanism powered by a unique circuit key."
Taurus says: "It makes anything."
Louie says: "Anything?"
Taurus says: "Anything!"
Taurus says: "Everything!"
Taurus says: "What's your favorite food?"
Louie says: "Pizza!"
Huey says: "Pizza!"
Scrooge says: "Haggis?"
Taurus says: "I heard haggis!"
Louie says: "Uhh..."
Huey says: "Uhh..."
Taurus says: "So, we use the key to find the right frequency and..."
Louie says: "Bleh!"
Louie says: "Ugh!"
Louie says: "Tastes like socks and bitter regret!"
Scrooge says: "That's how you know it's haggis."
Scrooge says: "This contraption could solve world hunger, replace the polar ice caps."
Louie says: "Pfft, who cares?"
Louie says: "Set that baby to rubies!"
Huey says: "This is incredible."
Huey says: "Where do the materials come from?"
Huey says: "Is it a cartridge or quantum dynamics."
Louie says: "Leave it to Huey to literally question how the sausage is made."
Louie says: "You taste that?"
Louie says: "It's success!"
Scrooge says: "Oh no, actually it's sheep's bladder."
Louie says: "Buey- Ew boy!"
Darkwing says: "The virtuous violet vigilante surveys the city for sin..."
Darkwing says: "sorry, could you film from the other side?"
Darkwing says: "My, my chin looks weird at this angle."
Dewey says: "Aw, we've been here for hours."
Launchpad says: "And I will cherish every second."
Dewey says: "Hi, Gizmoduck?"
Darkwing says: "No no no no no no!"
glass breaking says: "Darkwing: Ooh!"
glass breaking says: "I, I mean grr, crime!"
glass breaking says: "Time to swoop down on the delinquent."
fight scene says: "Darkwing: Ha ha ha ha, oh no."
fight scene says: "Your menacing misdeed has been inured you malfeasant..."
fight scene says: "movers?"
fight scene says: "But the glass breaking and the..."
fight scene says: "oh."
fight scene says: "I am so sorry, I uh I wouldn't want you to throw out your back, citizen."
fight scene says: "Lift with the knees."
fight scene says: "Ah forget it, what's the use?"
fight scene says: "How can I be a crime fighter when there's no crime?"
fight scene says: "I just wanted to inspire people, you know?"
fight scene says: "Make a difference."
Launchpad says: "Uh, Darkwing Duck?"
Darkwing says: "It's a sham, but at least the cape looks good, right?"
Dewey turns Darkwing's head to show him someone breaking into a building.
Darkwing says: "Villain!"
Darkwing says: "Ha ha!"
Darkwing says: "My clever ruse lured them out of hiding, and now, I strike."
The burglar reaches the ramrod control panel and attempts to take the key.
Darkwing says: "I am the terror that flaps in the night."
Darkwing says: "I am the turnip that turns up in your beet salad."
Darkwing says: "I am- hey not done yet."
Darkwing says: "Get back here!"
burglar says: "Uh!"
Dewey says: "Hi, I'm going to need you to sign a waiver to be on this show."
Darkwing says: "Not so fast, little girl?"
girl says: "Let me go!"
girl says: "Taurus Bulba can't see me."
Lights turn on and guards enter the room.
Darkwing says: "I can explain?"
Huey says: "Dewey?"
Huey says: "I thought if any of us would be arrested, it'd be Louie."
Louie says: "I am as surprised as anyone."
Scrooge says: "I can vouch for these two, I don't know the masked one."
Darkwing says: "Seriously?"
Darkwing says: "I starred in a movie for you."
Darkwing says: "We fought the moon together?"
Darkwing says: "You dressed up as me."
Taurus says: "Oh, I know exactly who he is."
scene switches to outside says: "Taurus: -hero!"
scene switches to outside says: "This noble Saint-Canardian guardian risked his life to stop a dangerous thief from sabotaging our lab."
Darkwing says: "Oh well, it's the least I can do."
Owlson says: "As mayor of Saint Canard, I've made super crime prevention a priority, and while this is not an invitation for a bunch of other costume yahoos to do the same, heroism must be rewarded."
Owlson says: "I am proud to present Darkwing Duck with the key to the city."
Darkwing says: "Mayor Owlson, I am honored to- woah!"
Darkwing says: "eh."
Taurus says: "While we at McDuck Enterprises are changing the world, heroes like Darkwing Duck are out there protecting it."
Darkwing says: "Ugh!"
Taurus says: "Although, maybe I should keep my key on me for safekeeping, huh?"
Taurus says: "Ha ha ha ha."
Louie says: "Huey?"
Huey says: "This is Dewey's hat."
Louie says: "Hmm."
Huey says: "Fine, I'm trying to figure out how the ramrod works."
Huey says: "It makes no sense."
Huey says: "How can you create something from nothing?"
Huey says: "And I know I've seen the circuit on that key before."
Louie says: "Why would you try to ruin a machine that could make me infinite gold?"
Huey says: "Because I have to know."
Huey says: "Also if you made infinite gold, it would devalue the price of all gold."
Louie says: "Stop ruining things for me."
Dewey says: "Live from Saint Canard, it's Dewey Dew-night, with our guest, that daring duck of mystery, that champion of right, Darkwing Duck."
Launchpad says: "Ooh, alright!"
Launchpad says: "I know those guys."
Launchpad says: "We hang out all the time."
Dewey says: "So, DW, got any new projects?"
Darkwing says: "Uh, defending the defenseless at every turn, heh heh, also I've got a cookbook."
Darkwing says: "Self-published."
girl says: "Oh, cool."
girl says: "So is stopping that crook, Taurus Bulba, on your busy schedule?"
Darkwing says: "You!"
Darkwing says: "How did you?"
girl says: "Ha ha!"
girl says: "I totally found your secret headquarters."
girl says: "The residue from you smoke bomb contained traces of salt water so I knew you'd be by the bay."
girl says: "Also, that kid is live-streaming."
girl says: "It was not hard."
Darkwing says: "Yah!"
girl says: "Keen gear, this place is huge."
Launchpad says: "Dewey, do something."
Dewey says: "I can't."
Dewey says: "This is good television."
girl says: "Whoa, look at these high-tech aero bolts..."
girl says: "with your face on them, like your motorcycle."
girl says: "You have a bit of a complex, don't you?"
Darkwing says: "What do you want, villain?"
Gosalyn says: "Nu-uh, it's Gosalyn, actually, and I want your help, hero."
Gosalyn says: "I figure you owe me one."
Darkwing says: "You kicked me in the face."
Gosalyn says: "You stopped me from exposing Bulba."
Darkwing says: "As a friendly, upstanding citizen with great taste in superheroes?"
Gosalyn says: "As a thief, and maybe worse."
Gosalyn says: "My grandpa, Doctor Waddlemeyer, built the ramrod under Bulba."
Gosalyn says: "But, Grandpa discovered a flaw in the programming."
Gosalyn says: "The ramrod was unstable and dangerous."
Gosalyn says: "One night he went to warn Bulba, and never came back."
Gosalyn says: "Now Bulba's claiming that he built the ramrod but if I can get that ramrod key, I can prove it's dangerous, stop Bulba, and find my Grandpa."
Darkwing says: "Okay, do you have any proof?"
Gosalyn says: "Besides that whole story and the fact that Bulba's a jerk?"
Darkwing says: "Listen, I- I feel for you, I- I do, but..."
Darkwing says: "he's an upstanding citizen and I've caught you breaking into two separate places in twenty-four hours."
Darkwing says: "Without evidence, I- I can't risk a good person's reputation."
Gosalyn says: "You mean you don't want to risk your own."
Gosalyn says: "Some hero."
Gosalyn says: "You know what?"
Gosalyn says: "I'll do it myself like always."
Dewey says: "Hey, wait up."
Gosalyn says: "I don't want to be part of your weird show, alright?"
Dewey says: "This isn't about my hit show."
Dewey says: "I, I know what it's like to search for someone that's missing."
Dewey says: "And, I know what it means to have someone believe you."
Dewey says: "Let me be your Webby."
Gosalyn says: "Who?"
Dewey says: "I mean we'll Dewey it."
Gosalyn says: "Does that mean you'll help?"
Dewey says: "Let's "Goz" for it, Gosalyn."
Gosalyn says: "Please stop."
Darkwing says: "I know you're gonna say and I can't."
Launchpad says: "We gotta at least check it out."
Darkwing says: "Bulba believes in me."
Darkwing says: "The city needs me."
Launchpad says: "Yeah, and so does she."
Dewey says: "Get it, cause my name is Dewey and I "Dew" things."
Launchpad says: "You want to make a difference, right?"
Gosalyn says: "Wooo, ha ha ha!"
All says: "Woah, woo hoo, ah!"
Huey says: "Ah, excuse me, Mr."
Huey says: "Bulba?"
Taurus says: "Huey, how can I help you?"
Huey says: "I have one quick question about the ramrod."
Huey says: "How?"
Huey says: "How can you make something from nothing?"
Huey says: "Where does the stuff the ramrod makes come from?"
Huey says: "Is it connected to those accidents you've been having?"
Taurus says: "Hehehehe."
Taurus says: "Feels like more than one question."
Taurus says: "Mr."
Taurus says: "McDuck, maybe these children should be in school."
Taurus says: "This one sure loves asking questions."
Scrooge says: "Aye, I also know how to trust this lad when he smells something fishy."
Scrooge says: "I'd like to see the ramrod plans."
Taurus says: "Hehehe."
Taurus says: "Right away, Mr."
Taurus says: "McDuck."
Darkwing says: "Agh- oof."
Darkwing says: "Ow."
Gosalyn says: "Sorry."
Gosalyn says: "Now fan out."
Gosalyn says: "Search for clues."
Taurus says: "Right this way."
Dewey says: "Hide!"
Taurus says: "Just let me get something from my filing cabinet."
Taurus says: "Here it is."
Darkwing says: "Awh, Agh!"
Huey says: "Those are the ramrod plans?"
Taurus says: "No, n-n-n-no."
Taurus says: "This is the index."
Taurus says: "The map will take you to the ramrod plans' room."
Taurus says: "Where all your questions should be answered."
Taurus says: "Darkwing!"
Taurus says: "What a surprise."
Darkwing says: "Yep, yep, yep, yep."
Darkwing says: "Just making sure your top-secret files were safe."
Darkwing says: "They are."
Darkwing says: "Hey, um, who's that?"
Taurus says: "My..."
Taurus says: "best friend."
Taurus says: "Thaddeus was always the smart one."
Taurus says: "Too smart."
Taurus says: "Sometimes, he couldn't shut that big brain off."
Taurus says: "He came to the lab one night, raving about fixing a flaw in the ramrod, and I assured him there wasn't one, but he didn't listen."
Taurus says: "He tried to reprogram it, and the ramrod..."
Taurus says: "backfired."
Taurus says: "Thad was blasted."
Taurus says: "Poof."
Taurus says: "I covered up the accident because I didn't want people to think he was a crackpot."
Taurus says: "Ugh, his poor granddaughter couldn't accept his grandfather was gone."
Taurus says: "A victim of his own genius."
Gosalyn says: "Liar!"
Darkwing says: "Gosalyn!"
Gosalyn takes the ramrod key from Bulba's lab pocket.
Taurus says: "Gosalyn?"
Gosalyn says: "He's not gone!"
Gosalyn says: "I can bring him back!"
Taurus says: "Grrr..."
Taurus says: "Get back here!"
Taurus says: "Gosalyn, stop!"
Taurus says: "Or, you'll get hurt."
Gosalyn says: "You'd like that, wouldn't you?"
Dewey says: "Gosalyn!"
Gosalyn gives the ramrod key to Dewey. Taurus targets Dewey.
Gosalyn says: "Dewey, let's, uh, "Goz" for it!"
Darkwing says: "Hold it right there, young lady."
Gosalyn says: "What're you doing?"
Gosalyn says: "Give that back!"
Darkwing says: "I'm sorry, kid."
Darkwing says: "Stealing this isn't gonna bring him back."
Gosalyn says: "Yes, it is!"
Gosalyn says: "He's not dead, he's in a different dimension!"
Darkwing says: "Wait, what?"
