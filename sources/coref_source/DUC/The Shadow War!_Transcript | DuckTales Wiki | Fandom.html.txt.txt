The episode commences at sunset in the Marina, the Duck triplets are carrying a box full of their old valuables.
Dewey says: "Got it."
Dewey says: "Got it, got it."
Dewey says: "No!"
Huey says: "Louie, pull your weight!"
Louie says: "Um, I'm stabilizing."
Grunts lift.
Leaders stabilize.
Webby says: "Ahh, life on a boat, huh?"
Webby says: "The lively rocking of the waves!"
Webby says: "Sleeping next to a dangerous boiler!"
Webby says: "And what's that?"
Webby says: "A longshoreman cursing?!"
Webby says: "!"
Webby says: "Fun!"
Dewey says: "Anything's better than the mansion with that selfish old miser."
Webby says: "Aw, that's not fair."
Webby says: "Scrooge isn't that old and selfish."
Webby says: "Okay, but in the most loveable way!"
Donald says: "Home sweet home."
Donald says: "Huh?"
Donald says: "Umm..."
Donald says: "."
Donald says: "I got snacks!"
Webby says: "Uhh heh."
Donald says: "Hmm?"
Webby says: "Ah Mmm!"
Donald says: "Wait, where's Dewey?!"
Donald says: "!"
Dewey says: "Nope."
Dewey says: "Right here."
Dewey says: "Not stealing the boat."
Donald says: "Oh!"
Dewey says: "Yep."
Dewey says: "Back to the good ol' days."
Dewey says: "Woo-woo."
Louie says: "Woo!"
Huey says: "Woo!"
Webby says: "Bbbb blah!"
Lena Magica.
Big day, Magica. Real big day. The eclipse is at hand, my plan is flawless.
Lena says: "Let."
Lena says: "Me."
Lena says: "Go!"
Magica Shadow.
Oh, that's right. I forgot you were here.
Lena says: "I won't let you do this!"
Magica Shadow.
Yeah, uh-huh. Oh, except at the moment of the eclipse, my powers will finally unleash, and I'll be an invincible juggernaut of dark magic! So, you know.
Magica returns into Lena's body.
Magica's voice Now that you've gained the trust of Scrooge's brats, I can use your body to get inside the house. takes out a potion Then, I'll weaken Scrooge with this, snatch the Number One Dime at the height of the eclipse, unleash my full power, and use it to destroy everything Scrooge has ever loved! Ha ha ha! Unh!
Launchpad pulls up and hits a button on a small black box, to talk to Scrooge.
Launchpad says: "Howdy, Mr."
Launchpad says: "McDee!"
Launchpad says: "Don't worry, I'm not here to check on you on account of everyone moving out because the boys blame you for launching their mom to space and orphaning them."
Launchpad says: "I'm here to take you out for ice cream!"
Launchpad says: "Mmm, sounds good, right?"
Launchpad says: "Family crisis- I mean, ice cream!"
Go away.
Magica's voice Out?! Moved?! ICE CREAM?! Without those kids to let me in, how am I supposed to get my evil, EVIL VENGEANCE?! breathing heavily No, I will defeat Scrooge McDuck. I am the dark shadow lying in wait! I am the stuff of nightmares lurking in the hidden recesses of your mind! I am.... AAAAAH!
Lena/Magica dodges Launchpad as he backs into the gate wall.
Magica's voice All right. Just have to convince Scrooge that I'm a typical little girl. Lena's voice Gee whiz, mister. It's me, that insufferable whelp, Lena? The little urchins invited me over to.... Uh..... what do children like? Play marbles?
Scrooge says: "The children are gone."
Scrooge says: "Leave me alone."
Scrooge says: "Forever."
Lena's voice Aw, shucks. Webby said this would happen.
Scrooge says: "What did she say?"
Lena's voice That you wouldn't be able to handle the kids leaving and have an old man meltdown. I thought better of you. Guess I was wrong.
The mansion gates open. Lena walks her way to the front door.
Magica's voice At last. A vanquishing for the ages, a final clash between the Sorceress of the Shadows and the world's greatest adventurer, Scrooge Mc-.
The door opens to reveal Scrooge in a dirty, sweaty sleeveless T-shirt.
Magica's voice Wait, what?
At the pier.
Launchpad says: "Hey, guys, I think you misplaced this box."
Dewey says: "We're throwing that away."
Webby says: "What?!"
Webby says: "!"
Webby says: "The Druid's Cup?"
Webby says: "This Mount Neverrest T-shirt?"
Webby says: "The Golden Khopesh of Toth-Ra that you conned Launchpad out of?!"
Webby says: "!"
Webby says: "Those artifacts are special!"
Dewey says: "It's just old junk."
Louie says: "Ah!"
Louie says: "Sploosh."
Huey says: "Seriously?"
Dewey says: "You're still holding it."
Louie says: "Oh, fine!"
Dewey grabs the khopesh and throws it overboard.
Louie says: "NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!"
Webby says: "I can't believe it's really over."
Webby says: "I mean, they're falling apart and they're family."
Webby says: "Are we next?"
Launchpad says: "Don't worry."
Launchpad says: "I've crashed literally hundreds of Mr."
Launchpad says: "McDee's vehicles, and he always gets over it."
Launchpad says: "The boys will, too."
Webby says: "I don't know."
Webby says: "This feels different."
Webby says: "They blame Scrooge for their mom's disappearance."
Launchpad says: "It'll blow over."
Launchpad says: "They'll be a happy family living in the mansion before you know it."
Donald says: "Boys!"
Donald says: "Good news!"
Donald says: "Where have you always wanted to go?"
Louie says: "Into the water to go get my Khopesh?"
Donald says: "What?"
Donald says: "No."
Donald says: "Cape Suzette!"
Donald says: "We're moving there tomorrow!"
Huey says: "A new town!"
Dewey says: "Cape Suzette, here we come!"
Louie says: "Finally!"
Webby says: "THEY'RE MOVING TOMORROW?!"
Launchpad says: "THEY'RE MOVING TOMORROW?!"
Webby says: "!"
Launchpad says: "!"
Webby says: "We have no time!"
Webby says: "The only family I've ever known gone forever!"
Webby says: "Ohhh!"
Webby says: "What do we do?!"
Webby says: "!"
Launchpad says: "This is bad!"
Launchpad says: "Real bad!"
Launchpad says: "Will Dewey and I still be friends?!"
Launchpad says: "!"
Launchpad says: "Who will I call for advice?!"
Launchpad says: "!"
Launchpad says: "Do they have phones in Cape Suzette?!"
Launchpad says: "!"
Webby says: "Okay, okay, one of us needs to stay calm here."
Launchpad says: "So..."
Launchpad says: "you?"
Webby says: "Uh..."
Webby says: "All we need is a simple plan to remind Scrooge and the boys how much they need each other."
Launchpad says: "Huh?"
Webby says: "An amazingly fun and elaborate farewell dinner party scheme!"
Launchpad says: "An amazingly fun and elaborate farewell dinner party scheme!"
Webby says: "Yes!"
Launchpad says: "Yes!"
Webby says: "Step one: We throw the boys a farewell party to convince them they don't want to move."
Launchpad says: "Step two: Reveal surprise guest Scrooge, and remind them how much they all miss each other."
Webby says: "Step three: There is no step three, because we just nailed it in two steps!"
Webby says: "Whoo!"
Launchpad says: "Whoo!"
Webby says: "Ow!"
Launchpad says: "Ow!"
Webby says: "Whooo!"
Launchpad says: "Whoo-hoo-hoo!"
Lena's voice Ugh! How long has your housekeeping staff been gone?
Scrooge says: "Three days."
Scrooge says: "So how are my so-called  Ah!"
Scrooge says: "Pesky possum!"
Scrooge says: "Keeps eating my anchovies!"
Magica appears in shadow form while Scrooge's back is turned.
Lena says: "Scrooge!"
That sad sack of feathers is not Scrooge. Dodges pigeon thrown at her The Scrooge McDuck I know is a shrewd, conquering hero of legend. watches Scrooge eat old pizza Unless this is all a trick. Yes, that's it! Of course! He senses something. He's trying to convince me he's a pathetic loser, hoping I'll make a mistake! Ha ha! You can't fool me, Scroogie! I am the one who fools! takes the potion from Lena One sip. Lights out. Grab the dime. Then, I enact.... my vengeance! cackling Thanks for the pep talk, Lena.
Huey says: "Huh."
Huey says: "It says here that Cape Suzette has a pretty neat park."
Huey says: "They just got a second swing."
Louie says: "And the Cape Suzette saltine cracker factory gives public tours."
Louie says: "And they let you sample the crackers at least?"
Huey says: "Yeah."
Louie says: "I mean, this place used to sound exciting, right?"
Dewey says: "Ah..."
Dewey says: "Fancy boat shoes..."
Dewey says: "."
Dewey says: "Pain worth it for the fancy boat shoes."
A slip of paper appears under the door.
Louie says: "."
Louie says: "you are cordially invited to your own dining room for a dinner full of heartwarming memories and surprises, question mark?"
Louie says: "Will you attend, 'yay' or 'nay'?"
Louie checks "yay" and slips the letter back under the door.
Webby says: "They're coming!"
Launchpad says: "They're coming!"
Webby says: "Whoo!"
Launchpad says: "Whoo!"
Launchpad says: "Oof!"
Webby says: "Now we just have to get Scrooge to show up."
Webby says: "But how?"
Webby says: "We're gonna have to be subtle."
Launchpad says: "Hello, Mr."
Launchpad says: "McDee!"
Launchpad says: "Come to a party on Donald's houseboat for, um..."
Launchpad says: "Um, a game of charades?"
Webby says: "Free food!"
I'll be there.
Webby says: "You will?!"
Webby says: "!"
Scrooge's voice But I'll only eat the finest lobster, caviar, canapés. And make sure no one starts eating until I get there, as I consider it the height of rudeness. Bless me bagpipes! Good day! Magica's voice Ha! Dinner officially ruined! Hm! Now, back to destroying Scrooge.
Scrooge says: "Where's that blasted nutmeg tea?"
Magica's voice Ooh. Convenient. Lena's voice Don't worry! I'll get it!
Donald says: "Hey, what's the big idea?!"
Donald says: "!"
Webby says: "Didn't the boys tell you?"
Webby says: "We're making you a heartwarming farewell dinner!"
Donald says: "Oh, fine."
Magica dumps the entire vial into a cup of tea for Scrooge.
Scrooge says: "One man's nephews' former bedroom is another man's pantry, I always say."
Magica's voice He is very committed to this "looking pathetic" trap. Lena's voice Have some tea. It'll settle you.
Scrooge says: "Thanks."
Scrooge set the tea down and moves pizza boxes around revealing a loose floor panel containing the boy's stuff.
Scrooge says: "Sweet, playful marbles."
Scrooge says: "Three to a bag."
Scrooge says: "Red, green, and that rascal blue marble, always rolling whichever way it wants..."
Scrooge says: "And ungrateful, the lot of them, at every turn!"
Scrooge says: "After all I did for them, and they just throw it in my face!"
Yeah, there's nothing worse than marbles. chuckles Tea?
Scrooge says: "I'm talking about family."
Ugh, tell me about it. They disobey you, run you ragged, don't follow through on elaborate revenge plots...
Scrooge says: "They spend your money, take over your home, cause trouble, worm their way into your head with fond memories that you cannae get out, no matter how hard you try!"
Cheers to ridding fond memories!
Scrooge says: "And then they leave without so much as a thank you!"
Forget family! Who needs 'em?
Scrooge says: "I'll drink to that!"
Scrooge says: "Aah!"
Magica's voice OF ALL THE IDIOTIC- Lena's voice I mean, I'll go make you another.
Webby says: "Come on, guys, you're gonna be late for the greatest dinner of all time!"
Webby says: "A culinary journey through Duckburg!"
Webby says: "Every bite reminding you how much you love this town you're leaving behind for some dumb reason."
Launchpad says: "Mmm, the "family-tini", old family recipe."
Launchpad says: "Tastes like the loving embrace of family."
Launchpad says: "Ahh!"
Huey says: "Are these melted popsicles in cups?"
Launchpad says: "The stirrer has a riddle on it."
Launchpad says: "Yeah, you won't get fancy stuff like this in Cape Suzette."
That's probably for the best.
Everyone turns around and surprised to see Beakley go down the stairs.
Beakly says: "I heard there was a farewell party."
Beakly says: "I brought ambrosia salad."
Webby says: "Uh!"
Webby says: "Granny's a master spy!"
Webby says: "She'll expose our plan!"
Webby says: "How'd she know about the party?!"
Webby says: "!"
Launchpad says: "I dunno."
Launchpad says: "I specifically wrote on her invitation, "don't come!"
Back at the party.
Webby says: "A toast!"
Webby says: "The dictionary defines "family" as "a group of people bound together by commitment and unwavering loyalty."
Webby says: "" So, let's each say one nice thing about a particular relative of ours."
Webby says: "Ahem."
Webby says: "Boys?"
Dewey says: "Uch, fine."
Dewey says: "I'll go with Uncle Donald, because well, he's devoted to his family."
Dewey says: "Unlike others."
Huey says: "Yeah, and he's thoughtful."
Louie says: "Don't forget passionate."
Donald says: "Aww!"
Launchpad says: "I like his sailor getup!"
Webby says: "Ugh!"
Webby says: "Okay, we all love Donald."
Webby says: "But how about a relative that is not in this room, who is over 80, and is very, very rich?"
Dewey says: "Why are you guys acting so weird?"
Launchpad says: "Uh, we're not!"
Launchpad says: "Emergency bounce house!"
Beakley says: "Webby, Launchpad."
Beakley says: "A word?"
Beakley says: "This is a parent trap, isn't it?"
Beakley says: "You're trying to manufacture sentiment to force Scrooge and the boys to come together against their wills."
Beakley says: "I want in."
Webby says: "Really?!"
Launchpad says: "Really?!"
Webby says: "!"
Launchpad says: "!"
Beakley says: "If this family won't come together, we'll have to do it for them."
Beakley says: "I assume you invited Scrooge."
Yeah, but he's running late.
Beakley says: "Okay."
Beakley says: "I'll get the boys and Donald emotionally primed while we wait."
Beakley says: "I'm a former agent and a grandmother."
Beakley says: "I know how to weaponize guilt."
Lena's voice Here, tea. This time in a convenient no-spill cup.
Scrooge says: "Finally, without those kids dragging me off on rip-roaring, unforgettable adventures, I can just sit here in peace, stare vacantly at my money, and sulk like an arrant recluse."
Lena's voice On an unrelated note, how's that tea?
Scrooge says: "Spilt."
Scrooge says: "Like my life."
Magica's voice Oh, my word, it's not a trap. He's actually become this pathetic! How DARE you make me pity you! This is not how I pictured killing you in my head for the last 15 years!
Scrooge says: "Go on."
Scrooge says: "Scram now."
Scrooge says: "Let me wallow in peace."
Scrooge says: "I "am" Scrooge McDuck."
Scrooge says: "I was adventuring before them."
Scrooge says: "No one helped me then, and I don't need help now!"
Yes! They were all in your way. Mooching, freeloading. Trying to weaken you with compassion and caring.
Scrooge says: "I'm going back to basics."
Scrooge says: "Doggedly driven, bare, barmy Scrooge flying solo!"
Scrooge says: "I don't need Duckburg or the mansion or the Bin!"
Scrooge says: "I can start from scratch!"
Scrooge says: "I dinnae need these pince-nez spectacles, this handmade silk-weave top hat, these satin spatterdashes!"
Scrooge says: "Yes, yes, yes!"
Scrooge says: "I don't need anything!"
Not even your Number One Dime!
Scrooge says: "Well, that's crazy."
Scrooge says: "Of course I need my dime."
What about starting from scratch? Just give me the dime, and I'll throw it away for you.
Scrooge says: "Why would a young lass be so interested in getting her hands on my ol' Number One Dime?"
Scrooge says: "Maybe you should be going."
Lena pounces on Scrooge.
Scrooge says: "Lena!"
Scrooge says: "What the?"
Scrooge says: "Have you gone daft?!"
Scrooge says: "!"
Scrooge says: "Look, I'm not gonna fight a child!"
Scrooge says: "Aaaah!"
Scrooge says: "Okay, fine!"
Lena grabs the dime as the eclipse fully forms. Magica laughs as her shadow fully emerges in front of Scrooge.
Scrooge says: "It cannae be..."
Scrooge says: "."
The shadow enters Scrooges dime and comes out a fully formed being.
Magica says: "Feed my power, Dark Eclipse, free my from the abyss, dormant magic now unchained, the Shadow Queen be whole agaaaaain!"
Magica says: "Ha ha!"
Magica says: "Yes!"
Magica says: "The magic!"
Magica says: "The body!"
Magica says: "I'm back!"
Magica grabs Lena's amulet and reforms it into a staff.
Magica says: "Hello, Scroogie."
Magica says: "I've missed you."
Scrooge says: "Magica DeSpell, you black-hearted wretch of the foulest lineage!"
Scrooge says: "Impossible!"
Scrooge says: "How?!"
Scrooge says: "!"
Magica says: "Why don't you ask your housekeeper's granddaughter's new best friend?"
Magica says: "You have a confusing family structure, you know that?"
Lena says: "You got your stupid body back, now leave us alone!"
Scrooge says: "Yes, scat, you rapacious ogress!"
Magica says: "Awww, but I just got here!"
Magica encases Scrooge and Lena in a magical cage.
Beakley says: "Apple shortbread pie with a scoop of sea salt ice cream."
Beakley says: "A common farewell dessert in certain parts."
Dewey says: "Finally."
Dewey says: "Some real food."
Beakley says: "Oh, I'm so sorry."
Beakley says: "This was Scrooge's favorite dessert."
Beakley says: "Oh, I don't want to remind you of that horrid man who lost your mother all those years ago, even if it was an accident that tore him up for ten years, propelling him into a desperate search attempt that left him broken and nearly bankrupt."
Louie says: "Wait, bankrupt?"
Louie says: "Really?"
Beakley says: "But I understand, you're upset because you lost one family member, which was terrible and painful, so you decided you should go ahead and lose another."
Beakley says: "Brilliant."
Beakley says: "Makes perfect rational sense."
Dewey says: "Yeah, nailed it, Mrs."
Dewey says: "B."
Beakley says: "Yes, distance yourself even further from his life and forsake family altogether."
Beakley says: "That will definitely fix it."
Launchpad says: "No!"
Launchpad says: "It'll do the opposite of that!"
Beakley says: "Perhaps it's worth considering that the reason Scrooge closed himself off was because the loss of Della was the hardest thing he'd ever faced, harder than any adventure."
Beakley says: "It's not that he didn't care, it's that he cared about family more than anything in the world."
Beakley says: "And perhaps he still does."
Beakley says: "But I'm just the housekeeper."
Beakley says: "What do I know?"
Launchpad says: "A lot!"
Launchpad says: "This lady knows a lot!"
Scrooge says: "You, wee tenebrious traitor!"
Scrooge says: "We welcomed you into our home, only to have you unleash this repugnant beast-monger!"
Lena says: "She's my aunt!"
Lena says: "She made me do it!"
Scrooge says: "Mmm!"
Scrooge says: "Family!"
Scrooge says: "Good for nothing!"
Scrooge says: "Left me completely vulnerable to this!"
Lena says: "Please."
Lena says: "Magica only got in here 'cause you threw your family out."
Lena says: "My family's good for nothing."
Lena says: "Your family is amazing."
Lena says: "You fight and get into trouble, but it doesn't matter, because you- I don't know, love each other or something."
Lena says: "Dude, I wish I had your family."
Scrooge says: "You're right, lass."
Scrooge says: "Help me get my family back, and you'll have a place in it."
Scrooge says: "We're all stronger together."
Scrooge says: "Ready?"
Lena says: "I'll see what I can do."
Scrooge says: "Come on, you Mephistophelian Medusa, let's- Ooh!"
Magica says: "Sorry, I was just watching you rally for a triumphant comeback."
Magica says: "So sad."
Magica says: "So futile."
Magica says: "Now where was I?"
Magica says: "Oh, yes."
Magica says: "Revenge!"
Lena says: "No!"
Lena says: "Not again!"
Lena says: "Don't send me back!"
Lena says: "Noooo!"
Scrooge says: "Bless me bagpipes."
Scrooge says: "Curse you, DeSpell!"
Magica says: "No, no, Scrooge."
Magica says: "Curse..."
Magica says: ".."
Magica says: "you."
Magica channels Scrooge into the dime.
Magica says: "Aaah!"
Magica says: "Mm, not the most inspiring final words."
Beakley says: "Now let's toast to a fine farewell meal, topped with a dash of perspective."
Dewey says: "So, this whole thing was to guilt us into going back to the mansion?"
Dewey says: "Well, it's not gonna work."
Dewey says: "Sorry, but it's too late."
Dewey says: "We're going to Cape Suzette with our real family, and that's that, right Uncle Donald?"
Donald says: "No."
Donald says: "Ms."
Donald says: "B's right."
Donald says: "Uncle Scrooge needs us, and we need him."
Donald says: "Our family has been apart too long."
Donald says: "It's time for us to come together."
Donald says: "Come here boys."
Huey and Louie go to Donald and hug him.
Dewey says: "Wait, wait, wait."
Dewey says: "But but the spear, and mom, and..."
Dewey says: "and!"
Donald nods to Dewey. Dewey wants to be mad at Scrooge, but he cries, and he goes to Donald hugging him.
Launchpad says: "Family..."
Launchpad says: "."
Webby says: "..."
Webby says: "trapped!"
Dewey says: "Let's go back to the mansion!"
The boat trembles and the group goes outside to see Magica.
Donald says: "Aw, phooey."
Magica casts a spell to release everyone's shadow.
Magica says: "Come to me, my shadow puppets!"
Gladstone says: "Hey!"
Gladstone says: "$20!"
Gladstone's shadow hands him the bill before he flies away.
Fenton says: "Ah, the perfect vantage point to view the lunar eclipse."
Fenton says: "Just me, the night sky, and a swirling shadow vortex."
Fenton says: "A swirling shadow vortex?!"
Fenton says: "!"
Fenton says: "Blathering Blatherskite!"
Fenton's shadow pushes him out of the way to claim the Gizmoduck suit.
Glomgold says: "Where are you going?!"
Glomgold says: "!"
Glomgold says: "You're my shadow, you hear?"
Glomgold says: "Curse you, me!"
Louie says: "Soooo..."
Louie says: "."
Louie says: "still going to Cape Suzette, right?"
Louie says: "Cool, yeah, I'll start the boat."
Magica says: "Take it in, Scroogie!"
Magica breaks the bin open.
Beakley says: "Magica De Spell!"
Dewey says: "Wait, who?"
Webby says: "Magica De Spell."
Webby says: "A vile sorceress with a mysterious, ancient grudge against Clan McDuck."
Webby says: "She was Scrooge's bitterest rival, but no one's seen her since they fought on Mount Vesuvius 15 years ago."
Beakley says: "All right, all."
Beakley says: "Cool heads."
A kelp monster emerges on the boat.
Louie says: "Take my brothers first, please!"
The monster removes his kelp to reveal Manny.
Donald says: "Oh."
Huey says: "It's just Manny!"
Gyro says: "That's it!"
Gyro says: "No more underwater labs."
Gyro says: "It's volcanoes or abandoned castles from now on!"
Huey says: "Dr."
Huey says: "Gearloose?"
Huey says: "What happened?"
Gyro says: "Our own shadows came to life and wrecked the lab-  A-ah- My shadow control ray is still on the test phase so this one is not on me."
Donald says: "Everybody, listen up."
Everyone else says: "What?"
Launchpad says: "Did anyone get any of that?"
Huey says: "It's mostly context clues."
Louie says: "We get, like, every third word."
Dewey says: "Nope, completely unintelligible."
Donald says: "I'll show you unintelligible!"
Gyro says: "Ugh, I don't have time for this."
Gyro says: "The Barksian Modulator."
Gyro says: "Able to translate neural impulses into sonic transmissions."
Launchpad says: "Buh?"
Gyro says: "It's a voicebox."
Louie says: "Oh, okay, Barksian Modulator."
Huey says: "Oh, okay."
Huey says: "Yeah, good idea."
Webby says: "What took you so long?"
Launchpad says: "Buh."
Donald says: "HANDS OFF OF ME..."
Donald says: "YOU MAD SCIENTIST!"
Dewey says: "Wow, he sounds so..."
Dewey says: "."
Dewey says: "normal."
Donald says: "Rubber baby..."
Donald says: "."
Donald says: "buggy bumpers, rubber baby buggy bumpers, rubber baby buggy bumpers, haha!"
Donald says: "Wow, never been able to say that before!"
Donald says: "As I was saying, Uncle Scrooge is in trouble, and it's up to us to help him."
Donald says: "Adventure is in our blood."
Donald says: "We face down perilous foes and endless dangers everyday, but we always prevail."
Donald says: "Because these."
Donald says: "Ducks."
Donald says: "Don't."
Donald says: "Back."
Donald says: "Down."
Beakley says: "Thank you, Donald."
Donald says: "-stage a coordinated attack."
Donald says: "Gyro, you and your team will charge the bridge to distract Magica's shadow forces."
Donald says: "Launchpad."
Donald says: "Head up the air attack to draw her attention."
Donald says: "Do you think you can crash into the bin?"
Donald says: "All right, all right, all right."
Donald says: "And Beakley, while the others are distracting Magica, you and I will sneak around back in my newly fixed-up houseboat."
Beakley says: "That is..."
Beakley says: ".."
Beakley says: "actually very close to what I was going to say."
Dewey says: "And we..."
Dewey says: ".."
Dewey says: "?"
Donald puts life jackets on the kids.
Donald says: "..."
Donald says: "will stay here and out of danger."
Webby says: "Oh, come on!"
Donald says: "This isn't an adventure."
Donald says: "This is Magica De Spell."
Donald says: "Under no circumstances are you kids to come to the bin."
Donald says: "Do you understand?"
Webby says: "Yes."
The triplets says: "Yes, Uncle Donald."
Dewey says: "So we're totally sneaking into the money bin, right?"
Huey says: "But how are we going to take on an entire shadow army?"
Dewey says: "The Ducks don't back down."
Dewey says: "Now, only if we knew someone with experience breaking into places."
Webby says: "You mean like a noble teen ne'er-do-well who can break into anything including your heart?"
Dewey says: "Yeah, that'd be great."
Webby says: "Lena!"
Huey says: "Lena!"
Louie says: "It's Lena!"
Dewey says: "Lena right, I was going to say Lena."
Dewey says: "Great."
Donald says: "Nuh-uh."
Donald says: "My house, my rules."
Beakley says: "Aye aye, sir."
Beakley says: "Get ready for the storm."
Donald says: "I am the storm."
Beakley says: "Uh, seriously."
Beakley says: "Have you've been saying things like that this whole time?"
Magica says: "Gah, best seat in the house."
Magica says: "Now the revenge monologue I've been plotting for fifteen years."
Magica says: ""To my most hated nemesis, that's you."
Magica says: "As you know, you banished me to a nether realm within your dime where I've been biding my time, devising your delicious downfall."
Magica says: "In conclusion-" Wait, these are out of order."
Magica says: "Hold on."
Magica says: "Hold on!"
Magica says: "Don't roll your eye at me!"
Magica says: "I've been trapped for fifteen years!"
Magica says: "I'm entitled to a full minute of gloating!"
Magica says: "I will make you watch as I destroy everything you've ever loved starting with your precious little town!"
Magica says: "Ooh that's good."
Magica says: "Got a pen?"
Dewey says: "Yo, Lena!"
Webby says: "Where are you?"
Webby says: "Oh, what if my best friend was taken by the shadows?"
Dewey says: "Webby, don't lose faith."
Dewey says: "Remember, Ducks don't back..."
Dewey says: "down?"
Gyro says: "Tonight, we seek revenge on those who destroyed our lab, and whoever defeats the most shadows will earn the most elusive prize of all, my respect."
Gyro says: "Oh, and the loser is fired."
Gyro says: "Good luck!"
Manny says: "I really need this job."
Launchpad says: "Pilot to co-pilot we're ready for launch."
Launchpad says: "Could be dangerous."
Launchpad says: "Suggested flight path?"
Bobblehead says: "Let's get dangerous."
Huey says: "Is this where Lena lives?"
Louie says: "Ugh, explains why she's always sleeping over at our house."
Webby says: "Lena?"
Webby says: "Sorry to barge in unannounced."
Huey says: "Maybe she's hiding?"
Dewey says: "A journal."
Webby says: "You can't read her journal."
Webby says: "Although if she were taken she might have left a note."
Webby says: "A poem!"
Webby says: "Best friend, rebel, poet: is there anything Lena can't do?"
Webby says: "Ahem."
To end the line of Clan McDuck,.
She sought a token of their luck,.
While with the eclipse in its prime,.
She trapped old Scrooge within his dime,.
But Scrooge reversed her vengeance plans,.
And in his dime the witch did land,.
Yet as he struck the final blow,.
She cast a spy from her shadow,.
I walk the earth and wield her power,.
To bring about McDuck's last hour.
Louie says: "Lena was Magica's spy?!"
Louie says: "!"
Huey says: "Lena is a shadow?"
Webby says: "She betrayed us all to free Magica."
Webby says: "She was never my friend."
Dewey says: "You might not have her, but you still have us."
Webby says: "Save it!"
Huey says: "Ah!"
Huey says: "Uh!"
Huey says: "Uh, guys."
Huey says: "Check this out."
Huey says: "Magica used the power of the eclipse to escape Scrooge's dime."
Louie says: "Only to trap him there instead."
Dewey says: "We have to get to that dime and save Scrooge ourselves, and I know just how to Dewey it."
Magica says: "Is this your favorite treasure?"
Magica says: "Oh, too bad."
Magica says: "Now it's ice cream."
Magica says: "Want a lick?"
Magica says: "Whoops."
Magica says: "How does it feel, Scroogie?"
Magica says: "Oh, looks like your family's come to play."
Magica says: "Say goodbye, McDuck."
Magica says: "Mwa ha ha ha ha ha!"
Magica says: "Fore!"
Magica says: "Home run!"
Magica says: "Tennis thing!"
Magica says: "Sports!"
Magica says: "Ha ha ha ha!"
Magica says: "Ha ha ha ha!"
The kids swim up through the breached underwater lab.
Louie says: "Look what I found?"
Louie says: "What?"
Louie says: "We like Scrooge again."
Louie says: "Ugh, whatever, get your own kopek."
Dewey says: "Elevator's busted."
Dewey says: "How are we going to get to the bin entrance on the top floor?"
Louie says: "Uuugh..."
Launchpad says: "Sorry to crash the party."
Launchpad says: "Sorry to crash the party."
Launchpad says: "Crash..."
Launchpad says: "the..."
Launchpad says: "par- Hey, not cool."
Gyro says: "Augh!"
Gyro says: "You'll never take me alive!"
Gyro says: "Wait, no."
Gyro says: "Please take me alive."
Magica says: "At last one of Scrooge's beloved nephew- Wait, who are you?"
Gyro says: "I'm Scrooge's number one scientist."
Magica says: "Blink once if this guy is a good friend, twice if he's just a work acquaintance."
Gyro says: "Aw..."
Magica says: "Bah!"
Donald says: "Ah, no, not now!"
Beakley says: "Ugh, hah, uh!"
Donald says: "We gotta get to the bin!"
Beakley says: "You go!"
Beakley says: "I'll be fine."
Beakley says: "Haven't had a proper fight in a while, anyway."
Donald says: "Look after my boat!"
Beakley says: "Huh, if Donald can keep this bucket afloat, how hard can it be?"
Beakley says: "Ugh, hah, huh!"
Beakley says: "Hey, what's the big idea?!"
Beakley says: "!"
Beakley says: "Ugh, hah, huh!"
Beakley says: "Oh, phooey..."
Dewey says: "So close."
Huey says: "Ugh."
Louie says: "Ugh, Louie..."
Louie says: "out."
Huey says: "Um, guys?"
Huey says: "When did our shadows come back?"
Huey says: "Ugh!"
Webby says: "G'aaaahh!"
Dewey says: "Ah!"
Dewey says: "Aaahh!"
Webby says: "Cut the lights so they won't cast shadows!"
Dewey hits the power cable using Louie's kopesh, shutting the lights down.
Huey says: "Now we can't see!"
Webby says: "I can."
Dewey says: "Everyone hold hands, and form a chain behind Webby."
Huey says: "Uh."
Louie says: "Ew!"
Louie says: "Huey, your hands are clammy."
Dewey says: "C'mon guys."
Dewey says: "Ducks don't back down!"
Huey says: "I literally never heard that family motto before today!"
Louie says: "Ugh, we're never going to find Scrooge's office."
Dewey says: "I found Scrooge's office."
Dewey says: "Okay, maybe we should listen to- Uncle Donald?"
Donald says: "Arrgh!"
Donald says: "Get away from my kids!"
Donald says: "Urgh!"
Donald says: "ha ha!"
Donald says: "Rrgh!"
Louie says: "We can explain!"
Donald says: "Please, I told you not to come, so of course you showed up just when I need you."
Louie says: "Classic reverse psychology."
Louie says: "I feel like I should have seen that coming."
Donald says: "Go save your uncle."
Donald says: "I'll keep these palookas at bay."
Donald says: "Ducks don't back down."
Dewey says: "See, I told you it's a thing."
Huey says: "It's cooler when he does it."
Donald says: "Come and get it, you no-good rarrgh!"
Kids says: "Waahhh!"
Kids says: "ugh!"
Magica says: "Ooh, look."
Magica says: "Children."
Magica says: "Looking for this?"
Magica says: "Come and get it."
Magica says: "Ha ha ha ha ha."
Dewey says: "Give us back our uncle!"
Magica says: "Oh, he's trapped forever inside the thing he loves most."
Magica says: "Sorry."
Webby says: "Split up!"
Huey says: "Then what?!"
Huey says: "!"
Dewey says: "Do what we do best: make trouble."
Donald says: "Take that!"
Donald says: "And that!"
Donald says: "Hey!"
Donald says: "Ow!"
Donald says: "Wait!"
Donald says: "Ow!"
Donald says: "Hey!"
Donald says: "Ow-ow-ow-ow!"
Donald says: "Who's- owowowow- next?!"
Donald says: "!"
Donald says: "Augh!"
Manny says: "Farewell..."
Manny says: "brother."
Fenton says: "Blathering blatherskite."
Fenton says: "Innovation, gentlemen."
Fenton says: "If we increase Lil' Bulb's wattage output, and optimize the laser's spacial coherence, yes."
Fenton says: "Manny, we ride!"
Beakley says: "Oh, he fixed the boat once."
Beakley says: "He can do it again, right?"
Beakley says: "Uh, yah, waah!"
Launchpad says: "Crash the party!"
Launchpad says: "Huh?"
Launchpad says: "Oh come on, I'm the best at crashing."
Launchpad says: "Wait!"
Launchpad says: "Take the wheel!"
Bobblehead says: "Let's get dangerous."
Launchpad climbs out on the plane,.
Gonna start a fight,.
Wish I could think of a word,.
That would rhyme with fight,.
Huey says: "Hey, couple of questions for you."
Huey says: "If you were caught in the dime, how come we never saw you in it?"
Huey says: "Also, Scrooge isn't exactly magical, so how did he manage to trap you in- Ahh!"
Magica says: "Ah!"
Huey says: "How does the lunar eclipse factor into all this?"
Magica says: "Well, you see I channel my powers..."
Magica says: "It's just magic, okay?"
Huey says: "Eh, ha, huh huh!"
Magica says: "Huh!"
Louie says: "Oh no, you broke the mirror of Taiki!"
Magica says: "The what now?!"
Magica says: "!"
Louie says: "Ancient artifact?"
Louie says: "Terrible curse if you break it?"
Magica says: "I've never heard of it, and I am versed in all magics."
Magica says: "Gaelic, Demogorgan, Sumarian."
Louie says: "Sumarian?"
Louie says: "You were in that dime a long time, ha ha ha."
Louie says: "Well, good luck with the curse."
Magica says: "What kind of curse?"
Louie says: "Grave misfortune, increased gullibility, a swift kick in the ribs."
Magica says: "A what?"
Webby says: "Hyah!"
Webby says: "Ah!"
Magica says: "My ribs!"
Webby says: "Grr!"
Magica says: "Ooh, someone's mad."
Webby says: "Uhp!"
Webby says: "Ugh!"
Webby says: "Hyah!"
Webby says: "I just got a family!"
Webby says: "I thought I had a best friend in Lena!"
Webby says: "Yah!"
Webby says: "And you took that all away!"
Webby says: "Guah!"
Webby says: "YOU ARE NOT..."
Webby says: "A..."
Webby says: "NICE..."
Webby says: "PERSON!"
Magica says: "AH!"
Webby says: "Ah!"
Webby says: "ugh!"
Magica says: "Lena couldn't be your friend, because she was never real!"
Webby says: "I don't believe you."
Dewey says: "huh!"
Dewey says: "Ah!"
Magica says: "You had sleepovers with a shadow."
Magica says: "You gave it a friendship bracelet."
Magica says: "Honestly, it's embarrassing how pathetic you were."
Magica says: "Here, let me put you out of your misery."
Webby says: "Nrrgh!"
Webby says: "huh?"
Magica says: "What?"
Webby says: "Huh?"
Lena says: "Get away from my best friend, Aunt Magica!"
Webby says: "Lena?"
Magica says: "Aunt?"
Magica says: "You're even worse than her!"
Magica says: "You aren't my family."
Magica says: "You are nothing!"
Lena says: "Ahh!!!!"
Webby says: "Nooooo!"
Webby says: "Rarrgh!!"
Magica says: "Gah!"
Webby says: "Rrgh!"
Webby says: "Rrgh!"
Webby says: "Rrgh!"
Webby says: "Rrgh!"
Dewey says: "Got it!"
Magica says: "Hey!"
Magica says: "Wha?!"
Magica says: "!"
Dewey says: "So listen, Uncle Scrooge."
Dewey says: "I guess I get why you didn't tell us about our mom."
Dewey says: "Shuh!"
Dewey says: "And maybe we should've realize that when we lost our mom, you lost her too."
Dewey says: "but, GAH!"
Dewey says: "Okay, not the time for a heart-to-heart."
Dewey says: "Ahh!"
Webby says: "Ahh!"
Magica says: "That's mine!"
Dewey says: "Ah!"
Magica says: "Gah!"
Dewey says: "Ahh!"
Dewey says: "Uhh!"
Dewey says: "Huh?"
Scrooge says: "Yah!"
Scrooge says: "Thanks, lad."
Scrooge says: "Way to dispel your own spell, De Spell."
Scrooge says: "Ah, yah!"
Scrooge says: "you know, I ought to to thank you."
Magica says: "For showing you how weak and pathetic you truly are?"
Magica says: "You're welcome."
Scrooge says: "If you hadn't attacked me, my family may well have left forever."
Scrooge says: "By trying to destroy me, you sort of saved my family."
Magica says: "That's not what happened!"
Donald says: "Huh, huh, I got it!"
Donald says: "Whuh!"
Donald says: "Yee!"
Donald says: "ugh!"
Magica's staff falls hand and hits Donald's head, cracking the gem.
Magica says: "Huh, AHHHH!!!!"
Magica loses her magic and shadow army. The Sun Chaser starts falling because it's no longer being held by the shadow vortex.
Launchpad says: "Ah!"
Launchpad says: "Huh?"
Magica says: "Ugh."
Magica says: "Hmm!"
Magica says: "my powers!"
Magica says: "They're gone!"
Magica says: "You ruined everything!"
Magica says: "Whuahh!"
Launchpad says: "Sorry to crash the party!"
Launchpad crashes on top of her.
Magica says: "Oof!"
Scrooge says: "Uwah!"
Launchpad says: "Huh, never crashed a "me" before."
Magica says: "Ugh!"
Magica says: "ugh!"
Magica says: "Curse you, McDuck!"
Magica says: "You haven't seen the last of me!"
Everyone says: "Woo hoo!"
Beakley says: "Good show!"
Donald says: "Woo hoo!"
Donald says: "We did it!"
Beakley says: "We sure did."
Beakley says: "Now about your boat."
Dewey says: "Ha ha, yeah!"
Webby says: "Lena's..."
Webby says: "gone."
Dewey says: "But she sacrificed herself to save you: Webby: Hah, I guess she really was my best friend."
Dewey says: "She'll always be with you."
Scrooge says: "Huey."
Scrooge says: "Louie."
Scrooge says: "The third one."
Scrooge says: "Curse me kilts, have I missed you!"
Webby, Dewey, Huey, Louie jump on Scrooge and hug him.
Donald chokes the voice box out of his throat.
Everyone says: "Ew."
Scrooge covers the voicebox with coins.
Scrooge says: "Anyone up for a midnight swim?"
They swim in money as Launchpad spits out the gold.
Launchpad says: "Bleh!"
Launchpad says: "Don't drink this water!"
On the moon, we see the wreckage of the Spear of Selene rocket. Within the rocket, an enigmatic person is setting up a TV and gets a signal of a news report by Roxanne. The person moves to see the news.
Roxanne Featherly says: "And so Duckburg is saved, thanks to Scrooge McDuck and his family!"
The enigmatic duck places a hand on the TV and removes the goggles; It is Della Duck!
Della Duck says: "Boys?"
