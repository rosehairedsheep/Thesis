Donald says: "Ow: Launchpad: These Woodchucks, gesture to stage, are a part of a tradition of Woodchuck excellence like legendary explorer Isabella Finch, point to paintings."
Donald says: "Note, Launchpad, do not read these parts."
Donald says: "Grape jelly stain,  mmmm."
Donald says: "Today, Junior Junior Woodchucks become Junior Woodchucks."
Donald says: "Junior Woodchucks become Senior Junior Woodchucks."
Donald says: "And, of course, a Woodchuck's proudest achievement is making the rank of Senior Woodchuck."
Donald says: "A Senior Woodchuck goes above and beyond to make themselves, and everything around them better."
Huey says: "This is my moment."
Launchpad says: "This year, I am pleased to announce our star candidate."
Launchpad says: "Congratulations to my close, personal friend, Violet Saberwing."
Violet says: "Sorry I'm late."
Violet says: "I was helping an elderly woman cross the street."
Lena says: "Woo, that's my sister from a couple misters."
Violet says: "Thank you."
Huey says: "You're a Junior Woodchuck, but I haven't seen you at any jamborees or fun time functions."
Violet says: "I prefer to focus my time on the real work of Woodchucking."
Launchpad says: "And this year, we have a second candidate for Senior Woodchuck, Dewey's brother."
Dewey says: "Go, yeah, you're the best: Della: That's my kid!"
Launchpad says: "As is our solemn custom, in the event of two candidates, our competitors will go head-to-head in the most intense physical and mental trial of their skills."
Launchpad says: "The Junior Woodchuck Wilderness Challenge!"
Launchpad says: "There can only be one Senior Woodchuck!"
Launchpad says: "Huh, neat."
All says: "Violet, Violet, Violet, Violet..."
Opening Theme says: "Huey: How did this happen?"
Opening Theme says: "If I'm not the best Junior Woodchuck, who am I?"
Webby says: "You're still a great Junior Woodchuck."
Webby says: "He just needs encouragement right now."
Huey says: "You know what?"
Launchpad says: "Uh-uh, no guidebooks allowed during the challenge."
Dewey says: "Ah, who needs a big book of rules, am I right?"
Huey says: "Huey!"
Huey says: "Huey needs a book of rules!"
Louie says: "I think what Dewey is trying to say is that you were born for this."
Louie says: "Now get out there, and show the other nerds that you are King Nerd."
Lena says: "Violet, Violet, Violet, Violet, Violet, Violet."
Violet says: "C'mon, Hubert."
Violet says: "A Woodchuck mustn't be late."
Dewey says: "Ooh, who's this lady?"
Scrooge says: "Isabella Finch."
Della says: "Adventurer?"
Della says: "Chief of Woodchuck exploration?"
Della says: "Braggler of the unknown?"
Scrooge says: "She was a legend to me growing up."
Louie says: "Cue story about Scrooge as a lad in 3..."
Louie says: "2..."
Louie says: "and."
Scrooge says: "When I was a lad, I only had money for a single pulp adventure book, but boy, did it count."
Scrooge says: "The Collected Adventures of Isabella Finch!"
Scrooge says: "I spent many a late night reading about how she bested the Fever Beast of Tibet, or slaughtered the Swiss Swarmi of Microbeesia."
Webby says: "Wow."
Scrooge says: "This woman made history, and deserves the utmost respect."
Scrooge says: "What?"
Scrooge says: "She hid this map here for future adventurers to find."
Della says: "Ooh, twist!"
Scrooge says: "And here on Woodchuck Island, Finch hid her greatest treasure surrounded by the deadliest obstacles she found on her journeys."
Scrooge says: "Her greatest adventure will become our greatest adventure."
Scrooge says: "Who knows what the treasure could be?"
Scrooge says: "The Ruby of Rangoon, the Golden Bullion of Goryeo, the- Oy, do you mind?"
Scrooge says: "I'm speechifying!"
Scrooge says: "That's better."
Scrooge says: "Where was I, ah yes."
Scrooge says: "Listen to the song of adventure calling you."
Dewey says: "Dee doodle dee doodle dee ha ha."
Dewey says: "What?"
Dewey says: "It's so catchy."
Launchpad says: "This course will test every aspect of your Junior Woodchuck knowledge."
Launchpad says: "You will place these flags on designated trail markers like so as you make your way north to the highest points on the island."
Launchpad says: "At the mountains peak, whoever plants their final flag first will become the next Senior uh,  Senior Woodchuck!"
Launchpad says: "Ready?"
Huey says: "I was born ready."
Violet says: "If you are as prepared as a helpless baby, then I will beat you easily."
Violet says: "Apologies, Lena told me that friendly smack talk is expected in competitions such as these."
Lena says: "Call him a clown!"
Violet says: "Clown!"
Huey says: "Hey, may the best Woodchuck win."
Violet says: "Likewise."
Launchpad says: "Go go go go go!"
Huey says: "When you don't have a compass, make one."
Huey says: "Now we just have to find north and place the first trail marker."
Huey says: "Good job, Huey."
Huey says: "Already in the lead."
Huey says: "Ugh, hm, uh "Hubert who is in second place and holding this letter?"
Huey says: "You are?"
Huey says: "Best wishes, Violet?"
Huey says: "" What the?"
Violet says: "Was that good smack?"
Violet says: "Do you feel appropriately razzed?"
Huey says: "Urgh!"
Donald says: "Hah, hah!"
Donald says: "hah!"
Scrooge says: "We're on the exact path Finch took in her very last adventure."
Scrooge says: "Now let's stick to her- What is this bird doing here?"
Dewey says: "Giving me the irresistible urge to bust several moves."
Dee doodle dee doodle dee whistle. Dee doodle dee doodle dee whistle. Dee doodle doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo Dewey Dewey.
Webby says: "Aw, they're both so cute."
Scrooge says: "Alright, don't get distracted."
Scrooge says: "Back to the real adventure."
Louie says: "Not at all funny."
Dewey says: "Dee doddle doo doo doo Dewey Dewey."
Donald says: "Aahh!"
Donald says: "Stupid nature!"
Della says: "It's just a mosquito."
Della says: "You should give it some of your blood."
Dewey says: "Hey!"
Dewey says: "We were just getting the flow going."
Dewey says: "Come back."
Scrooge says: "Where are you going?"
Scrooge says: "That's not Finch's path."
Huey says: "Ah!"
Huey says: "Stupid stretching leaf!"
Huey says: "Ow!"
Huey says: "Ow!"
Violet says: "You need to sever the rubber leaf at the base."
Huey says: "Yes, thank you very- Ow- much."
Huey says: "I knew that, ow!"
Violet says: "Very well."
Violet says: "Now eat my dust."
Violet says: "That was the smack talking."
Huey says: "Ow, gah!"
Huey says: "Ugh."
Huey says: "Ah, easy Huey."
Huey says: "The guidebook says that every setback is an opportunity for, ow, growth."
Louie says: "Gah, why would rain ever be made of lightning?"
Scrooge says: "This is the lightning rain of Chilipopo."
Scrooge says: "Ol' Isabella braved a 183 day lightning rain with only grits, determination, and the hat on her head."
Louie says: "She had a hat?"
Scrooge says: "Come now."
Scrooge says: "We are walking in the footsteps of a giant."
Scrooge says: "Not a literal giant."
Webby says: "Aw."
Della says: "Yep, ah!"
Della says: "See Donald?"
Della says: "Ow!"
Della says: "Nature's not so bad!"
Della says: "I hate rain, rargh!"
Donald says: "Ow!"
Dewey says: "Quiet everyone."
Dewey says: "I think my quirky new sidekick is trying tell me something."
Scrooge says: "Of course."
Dewey says: "Huh?"
Dewey says: "What's that?"
Dewey says: "You want us to follow you on a brand new adventure?"
Dewey says: "Well, let's go!"
Scrooge says: "But, but, but we're already on a perfectly good adventure."
Huey says: "Uh, aloe on your ouchies prevent the mean and grouchies."
Huey says: "Ah, see, I don't need the most badges just to prove I'm the best Woodchuck."
Huey says: "All I need is my wits, a little know-how, and..."
Huey says: "I am lost."
Huey says: "Okay, when lost, a Woodchuck retraces their steps, but then I'll fall even farther behind, and then I'll lose."
Huey says: "No guidebook, no map, no clue, no guide book, no hopes, no chance, no guidebook."
Huey says: "I'll just go to the guidebook in my mind."
JW Guidebook says: "I recon you're searching for navigational techniques."
Huey says: "This is new."
JW Guidebook says: "My name is J."
JW Guidebook says: "W."
JW Guidebook says: "Guidebook, the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook in you mind."
JW Guidebook says: "I'm here to help you out, teach you a thing or two about nature, and yourself."
Huey says: "Uh-huh."
JW Guidebook says: "Yeah, I recon you want to track your direction by the sun."
Huey says: "Hey, that's right."
Huey says: "Just set down a stick, and follow the shadow."
Huey says: "Hah, I'd like to see Violet conjure a talking book from her psyche."
Huey says: "You're going to do it, Huey."
Huey says: "Just you, and nature, and..."
Huey says: "Ahh!"
JW Guidebook says: "Well, that is a pickle of a different color."
Huey says: "Gah!"
JW Guidebook says: "Stay calm."
JW Guidebook says: "Remember your training."
JW Guidebook says: "Make yourself big, and intimidating."
Huey says: "Rawr!"
Bear says: "RAWR!"
Huey says: "Aaaahh!"
JW Guidebook says: "Skedaddle, boy!"
JW Guidebook says: "That bear don't care for book learning!"
Huey says: "Ah, uh, come on, Huey."
Huey says: "You know what to do."
Huey says: "Book, what do I do?"
JW Guidebook says: "Me, Rule 8 Number 43: if a bear you spy, string your food up high."
Huey says: "I don't have any food, except, that's it."
Huey says: "I'm the food."
Huey says: "Hup, ah, gasp, ungh."
Bear says: "Roar!"
Bear says: "ROAR!"
JW Guidebook says: "Now boy, that's real Senior Woodchuck thinking."
Huey says: "Ha ha, there's the next marker."
Huey says: "Let's see Violet pull this off?"
Violet says: "Hubert."
Huey says: "Violet, no!"
Violet says: "If it makes you feel better, Lena says that first is the worst and second is the best."
Violet says: "D'oh."
Violet says: "Actually that's wrong, but I am- Ahhh!"
Huey says: "Violet, no!"
Violet says: "Ahh, oh."
Bear says: "RAWR!"
Violet says: "No more climbing points."
Violet says: "I appear to be stuck."
JW Guidebook says: "Me, Rule 17: a Woodchuck looks out for their fellow Woodchucks, whatever the cost."
JW Guidebook says: "You could toss down a rope."
Huey says: "You know, I bet if I make it to the final checkpoint first, there will be someone there who can help."
Huey says: "I could win the challenge, and look out for my competitor."
Huey says: "Hup, be right back."
JW Guidebook says: "Hey, where are you going?"
Violet says: "Hubert, wait."
Violet says: "Was it because of my razzing?"
Violet says: "Curse my flawless slams."
Violet says: "Junior Woodchuck rule 732: respect nature, and nature will respect you."
Della says: "Once again, nature provides."
Scrooge says: "Alright, if we turn back now, we can still brave the Devil's Teeth on the Eternal Quicksand, slay the Unfathomable Phoenix guarding the treasure, and be back before Huey finishes his challenge."
Scrooge says: "Lest that bird ruins our adventure again."
Dewey says: "Hey, that bird led us to safety."
Scrooge says: "Of what?"
Scrooge says: "A bit of electrified rain?"
Louie says: "Yes."
Scrooge says: "Gah!"
Scrooge says: "Out of my way, you pesky poultry."
Scrooge says: "Is that the Nandi Bear from Finch's Cave of the Bear Clan?"
Scrooge says: "Ha ha, don't you want to find the massive and ferocious bear with claws the size of a man?"
Louie says: "No."
Scrooge says: "But Finch herself fought this beastie, and oh no you don't, you avian agitator."
Scrooge says: "Not this again."
Scrooge says: "What the?"
Scrooge says: "The map!"
Scrooge says: "Everyone follow that bird!"
Bear says: "Roar!"
Huey says: "Hah, soon to be Senior Woodchuck summons the insurmountable mount- of course."
JW Guidebook says: "Okay, Huey, no pressure."
JW Guidebook says: "Sure, you just abandoned a fellow Woodchuck, but hey, you're about to win, and that's all that matters, right?"
Huey says: "Not helping, Book."
JW Guidebook says: "Woah, what are you doing?"
JW Guidebook says: "Rule 726: always check every bridge for stability."
Huey says: "I don't have time for rules!"
Huey says: "Are you coming or not?"
JW Guidebook says: "No, where you go now, I cannot follow."
Huey says: "Fine, I don't need your help."
Huey says: "I'm going to be a Senior Woodchuck."
Huey says: "Aah!"
Violet says: "Hubert?"
Huey says: "Aahh!"
Violet says: "Hubert?"
Huey says: "Yes, I know!"
Huey says: "Ah!"
Huey says: "Ugh!"
Huey says: "Okay, okay, uh, when you're between a rock and a hard place, uh, I don't know."
Huey says: "I'm going to throw this rock."
Huey says: "She might have more badges, but ol' Huey put in the time."
Huey says: "Huey's going to be the Senior Woodchuck."
Huey says: "Huey "has" to be the Senior Woodchuck."
Scrooge says: "Hup, grr."
Scrooge says: "Ach, sacious bird!"
Scrooge says: "Stupid..."
Scrooge says: "bird!"
Scrooge says: "Oh, I'm so mad, I can't even alliterate."
Webby says: "Which way did the bird go?"
Scrooge says: "Fantastic."
Scrooge says: "We followed that bird brain through an uncharted cave, and now we are missing out on the adventure!"
Louie says: "I'm cold and terrified."
Louie says: "Sure feels like an adventure to me."
Dewey says: "Or maybe it's just a different adventure."
Scrooge says: "Well, it's not the right one."
Scrooge says: "We're supposed to be following in the footsteps of greatness following the map."
Webby says: "Adventure isn't about following the same old path."
Webby says: "It's about discovering new things, and going off the map."
Scrooge says: "Poppycock."
Scrooge says: "Whoever told you that?"
All says: "You!"
Scrooge says: "But, but it's history."
Dewey says: "So, let's rewrite history."
Scrooge says: "Ahem."
Scrooge says: "Dee doodle dee doodle dee ha ha."
Scrooge says: "Dee doodle dee doodle dee ha ha."
Scrooge says: "Dee do, oh."
Scrooge says: "Huh, what do you think, family?"
Scrooge says: "Should we follow this crazy bird to some unknown adventure?"
All says: "Woo hoo, yeah!"
Huey says: "Yow!"
Huey says: "You've never failed a Woodchuck test before."
Huey says: "Be better."
Huey says: "Almost there, you're going to be a Senior Woodchuck- oh come on!"
Violet says: "I deduce the most effective use of this rising heat is a hang glider."
Violet says: "See you at the finish line, chump."
Huey says: "What do I do?"
Huey says: "J."
Huey says: "W."
Huey says: ", I need your help."
JW Guidebook says: "Well Huey, the only person who can help you is you, see the true lesson- AAAHHH!"
Huey says: "Ah!"
Huey says: "What is happening?!"
Huey says: "!"
JW Guidebook says: "I DON'T KNOW!"
JW Guidebook says: "WHY ARE YOU IMAGINING THIS?!"
JW Guidebook says: "!"
Huey says: "Ahh!"
Huey says: "Ugh, ugh."
Huey says: "Aaahhh!"
Huey says: "Huh?"
Huey says: "Violet?"
Huey says: "But you could have."
Violet says: "Junior Woodchuck Rule 162: a Junior Woodchuck looks out for their fellow Woodchucks, whatever the cost."
Huey says: "You really are a better Woodchuck than me."
Huey says: "Ah!"
Huey says: "Ahh!"
Huey says: "I broke the rules."
Huey says: "I left you behind."
Huey says: "I didn't just fail the challenge, I failed my oath."
Huey says: "I don't deserve these."
Violet says: "I too, have failed before."
Huey says: "Wait, there's a failure badge?"
Violet says: "I tried to qualify for Senior Woodchuck three times before I was accepted this year."
Violet says: "Yes, failure is a logical and natural conclusion of trying something new."
Violet says: "Junior Woodchuck rule number 7: work harder, make yourself better, and try again."
Violet says: "Come, let us finish together."
Violet says: "Perhaps we can both be Senior Woodchucks."
Huey says: "No, you earned it."
Huey says: "I haven't..."
Huey says: "yet."
Violet says: "Hm, I thought this would be more climactic."
Huey says: "Ah!"
Huey says: "What do we do?"
Huey says: "You're the Senior Woodchuck."
Huey says: "I respond to authority."
Huey says: "Launchpad?"
Violet says: "Launchpad?"
All says: "Launchpad?"
Launchpad says: "Hey, I'm Launchpad."
Launchpad says: "You guys are just in time to see the winner."
Della says: "Yes!"
Della says: "That's my boy!"
Huey says: "Actually, I lost."
Della says: "That can't be right!"
Della says: "The challenge was rigged!"
Della says: "My boy deserves to win!"
Huey says: "No, mom, I didn't, and that's okay."
Lena says: "Yeah!"
Lena says: "You lost!"
Violet says: "Lena!"
Violet says: "shh."
Huey says: "Launchpad, I will take my failure badge, please."
Launchpad says: "Here, take one of mine."
Launchpad says: "And now, welcome the newest Senior Woodchuck, Violet Appelonia Saberwing."
Lena says: "Ha ha ha."
Huey says: "Yeah, go Violet."
Huey says: "Woo hoo!"
Scrooge says: "We learned an important lesson today."
Scrooge says: "Adventure is not always about the treasure that awaits us at the end, but the journey- Will you knock it off with the song?"
Huey says: "Wait, that song."
Huey says: "Is that the Titter Twill Bird of Knowledge?"
Louie says: "The hoobata bird of what now?"
Huey says: "The legendary mascot of the Woodchucks, descended from the personal pet of Isabella Finch herself."
Dewey says: "It wasn't distracting us."
Dewey says: "It was guiding us to Finch's treasure."
Scrooge says: "I can't believe it."
Scrooge says: "The last treasure of Isabella Finch."
Webby says: "It was under our noses this whole time."
Scrooge says: "It's more precious than I ever could have imagined."
Louie says: "The treasure is a book?"
Louie says: "Boooo!"
Scrooge says: "It's Finch's lost adventure journal."
Scrooge says: "It contains all the adventures she had."
Scrooge says: "Advice she left for future generations."
Donald says: "Ah, ah, ah, ahh!"
Webby says: "She really did have the answer for everything."
Scrooge says: "Or almost everything."
Huey says: "The missing mysteries?"
Huey says: "This is a list of legends Finch never found."
Huey says: "The stone of what was, the lost harp of Mervana, the third eye diamond."
Huey says: "This can help us find the greatest lost mysteries of all time."
Scrooge says: "Now, that is an adventure."
Scrooge says: "What do you say, family?"
All says: "Yeah!"
All says: "Woo!"
Gandra Dee says: "The Ducks found the journal."
Black Heron says: "Access to the most mysterious relics lost to time."
Bradford says: "Then the race is on."
