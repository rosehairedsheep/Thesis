Episode Info says: "Transcript: Gallery: Clips: Inn manager: Five hundred years ago, Spanish explorer Ponce de León set out to find the Fabled Fountain of the Foreverglades said to grant youth to all who drink from it."
Episode Info says: "The fountain may be a legend, but you can experience the rejuvenation of youth here at the Conquistador Inn where the years simply melt away."
Springbreaker says: "Spring Break!"
Springbreaker says: "Woo!"
Scrooge says: "Spring Break?"
Scrooge says: "Boo!"
Scrooge says: "Youth is wasted on the young."
Webby says: "Aw c'mon, Uncle Scrooge."
Webby says: "I'm sure these teens have had a very difficult academic year and deserve to blow off steam."
Scrooge says: "At their age, I couldn't afford to blow off steam."
Scrooge says: "I had to use it to turn my Uncle Porthole's steamboat because I had a job."
Louie says: "Wait, if you hate young people, why are we staying at a hotel full of them?"
Scrooge says: "Because, it's near the last known location of the Fountain of the Foreverglades."
Huey says: "Which is the next missing mystery of Isabella Finch."
Scrooge says: "Also it was cheap."
Springbreaker says: "Spring Break!"
Inn manager says: "Along with a great price, we offer a world-class spa and a crystal clear pool for the whole family, all surrounded by  casual elegance."
Webby says: "C'mon, let's go!"
Webby says: "That youth fountain ain't getting any younger!"
Scrooge says: "Ach!"
Scrooge says: "My back is killing me."
Scrooge says: "I need to ice it and prep for a morning start."
Scrooge says: "Do not disturb me."
Huey says: "A free afternoon, eh?"
Huey says: "Luckily, I've scheduled it down to the minute."
Dewey says: "How?"
Dewey says: "You just found out we had a free afternoon!"
Scrooge says: "Good thinking, lad."
Scrooge says: "Huey's in charge."
Scrooge says: "He's oldest."
Dewey says: "We are triplets!"
Dewey says: "Huey's always in charge."
Huey says: "We better change into our suits if we're going to fit in a swim before lunch."
Dewey says: "Stupid being second oldest."
Scrooge says: "Now for a little peace and..."
Goldie says: "Knock it off, you pool-floatin' showboaters!"
Goldie says: "Fancy meeting me here."
opening theme says: "Webby: Goldie O'Gilt!"
Scrooge says: "No, no, no, no!"
Goldie says: "Oh yes!"
Goldie says: "Yes, yes, yes, yes!"
Scrooge says: "What are you doing here, you savings swindling swine?"
Goldie says: "Definitely not jumping your claim to the fountain before you."
Webby says: "But that's not..."
Webby says: "you..."
Webby says: "that's cheating!"
Goldie says: "No I believe that's  workin' smarter while you work harder, eh Scrooogey?"
Scrooge says: "Without Finch's journal, you'll never find the..."
Goldie says: "The old guy's giving out free t-shirts!"
Scrooge says: "Unhand me!"
Scrooge says: "Ah!"
Webby says: "What about the boys?"
Scrooge says: "No time!"
Scrooge says: "If Goldie beats me to that fountain, I'll have to hear about it for the next hundred years!"
Dewey says: "Why does being hatched three seconds earlier automatically make you in charge of everything?"
Huey says: "Because the oldest is in charge, That's just how it goes."
Louie says: "Ugh!"
Louie says: "Guys, this is my one afternoon to Louie out at a luxury resort before we almost die in a swamp."
Dewey says: "I'm hitting the pool."
Huey says: "Woah, woah, woah."
Huey says: "Pool's too busy now."
Huey says: "We're scheduled to relax next to the pool."
Dewey says: "Nerp!"
Dewey says: "Dewing it now!"
Dewey says: "Spring break!"
Springbreaker says: "Whoo!"
Dewey says: "Gnah!"
Dewey says: "Spring..."
Dewey says: "break?"
Dewey says: "Aw, man..."
Huey says: "If you're done, next on the schedule: relaxing."
Dewey says: "How about a vote?"
Dewey says: "I vote no."
Dewey says: "Louie?"
Webby says: "Hah!"
Webby says: "Take that, Goldie!"
Webby says: "We're gonna beat her."
Webby says: "Uncle Scrooge?"
Goldie says: "Back problems?"
Scrooge says: "Not so bad I can't best you, you AAHH!"
Goldie says: "Getting old is a pain in the keister."
Goldie says: "Literally."
Webby says: "Should we take a time out, or..."
Scrooge says: "I just need some water."
Goldie says: "Ah, too bad you don't have any."
Scrooge says: "Grr."
Goldie says: "Oh please."
Goldie says: "I stole this water from the hotel fair and square."
Scrooge says: "Aye, but you stole that canteen from me on Oak Island in '73."
Scrooge says: "Give it here!"
Goldie says: "I took it as payback after that bridge snapped and you let me fall."
Scrooge says: "You cut the bridge."
Webby says: "You two have so much history."
Scrooge says: "Aye, full of betrayal."
Goldie says: "Why stop now?"
Goldie says: "Ha!"
Webby says: "Aw, so cute."
Webby says: "I can't wait to get old."
Huey says: "And..."
Huey says: "relaxed."
Huey says: "Right on schedule."
Dewey says: "What are you guys staring at?"
Louie says: "Dewey, are you taller?"
Dewey says: "What?"
Dewey says: "I must have hit a growth spurt."
Huey says: "Hm, that's crazy."
Huey says: "You hatched after me."
Dewey says: "Well, Hubert."
Dewey says: "Maybe my egg was laid first, ergo vis-a-vis, it is I who am big brother now."
Huey says: "That's not how biology works."
Dewey says: "It is now, because big brother is in charge!"
Dewey says: "I'll take that."
Dewey says: "Yoink!"
Huey says: "Ah!"
Huey says: "curse my too short limbs!"
Scrooge says: "How're your knees holding up?"
Scrooge says: "Ow!"
Goldie says: "Better than your back."
Webby says: "The fountain is so close!"
Webby says: "Don't let her get under your skin!"
Goldie says: "Yeah, don't let me get under your wrinkly old skin, Scroogey!"
Goldie says: "Oh!"
Scrooge says: "Ah!"
Webby says: "Uncle Scrooge!"
Webby says: "And Goldie, too, I guess."
Webby says: "Hup!"
Webby says: "Guh!"
Scrooge says: "Bless me bagpipes!"
Goldie says: "Great gobs of goblin spit!"
Goldie says: "You're young!"
Scrooge says: "You're young!"
Scrooge says: "The stream must be fed by the Fountain of Youth!"
Scrooge says: "If we follow it, we'll find its source!"
Scrooge says: "Do you know what this means?"
Goldie says: "Yep!"
Goldie says: "Beating you will be so much easier now!"
Goldie says: "Ha!"
Scrooge says: "Ah ha ha ha!"
Webby says: "Hey!"
Webby says: "Wait up!"
Webby says: "Wow!"
Webby says: "You are fast now!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Finally, the fountain will be mine."
John D Rockerduck says: "Thus begins the revenge of John D Rockerduck."
John D Rockerduck says: "Ah ha ha ha ha ha!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Now fan me."
Scrooge says: "Not so old now, am I?"
Goldie says: "Not at all."
Goldie says: "I'd forgotten how almost attractive you used to be."
Scrooge says: "Really?"
Scrooge says: "Oh!"
Goldie says: "Ha ha!"
Goldie says: "Young Scrooge falling for the same old tricks."
Scrooge says: "Ha ha!"
Scrooge says: "It is on!"
Scrooge says: "I haven't felt this spry in ages!"
Webby says: "What?"
Webby says: "No!"
Webby says: "Your cane is part of your mystique!"
Scrooge says: "I love being Young!"
Scrooge says: "Whoo!"
Webby says: "Wait!"
Webby says: "Come back!"
Dewey says: "As your "big" brother, I'm obviously wiser."
Dewey says: "So, forget the schedule."
Dewey says: "Let's go nuts!"
Dewey says: "Lunchtime!"
Dewey says: "Since the spring breakers are in the pool, we'll eat before the..."
Dewey says: "huh?"
Dewey says: "..."
Dewey says: "rush?"
Huey says: "Oh, weird."
Huey says: "Old people eat early?"
Huey says: "In Florida?"
Huey says: "If only the big brother had done his research!"
Dewey says: "Big brother eats first."
Dewey says: "Where did all these seniors come from anyway?"
Inn manager says: "This hotel caters to the young, and to the young at heart."
Louie says: "That's code for old people."
Inn manager says: "Now, who wants more gelatin?"
Senior says: "Whoo!"
Louie says: "Hm."
Webby says: "Careful, you newly young whippersnappers, If you fall into this stream again, you could be young forever."
Goldie says: "Oh no, what a terrible fate."
Webby says: "Just follow me."
Webby says: "Easy..."
Scrooge says: "Ugh!"
Scrooge says: "Ha ha ha ha!"
Webby says: "What are you doing?"
Webby says: "That's dangerous!"
Goldie says: "Who cares?"
Goldie says: "Hah!"
Goldie says: "I'm young and invincible!"
Goldie says: "You..."
Goldie says: "caught me."
Scrooge says: "Was I supposed to let you fall?"
Goldie says: "You did on Oak Island."
Scrooge says: "I guess I'm not the man I used to be."
Webby says: "Ooh, you repellent reptilian rogue!"
Scrooge says: "We better be off."
Goldie says: "Yep, gotta find that fountain."
Webby says: "Ngah!"
Webby says: "Ow, ow..."
Dewey says: "Okay, I know we didn't get dessert and we had to rush through the spa treatments, but we have plenty of time to get our hair beaded."
Dewey says: "Best big brother ever!"
Huey says: "If only we had some kind of list of times and events that told us what to do."
Dewey says: "Show some respect for your elder."
Huey says: "You're not the oldest, just the tallest!"
Dewey says: "You're just jealous because I'm a better big brother than you."
Huey says: "Maybe if you had to deal with a middle brother like..."
Huey says: "you."
Huey says: "You're the "Huey."
Huey says: "" Fine, then I'm the Dewey, and I wanna play."
Dewey says: "But, but the bead station closes in five minutes."
Huey says: "Who cares about the schedule, right?"
Huey says: "Let's "Hue" this."
Huey says: "Hyah!"
Louie goes to refill his drink while Huey and Dewey play ping-pong. He notices the inn manager filling up a canteen, and locking the door with a key, a padlock, and a combination lock.
Louie says: "Hm..."
Webby says: "Alright, once we find that fountain, we'll log it into Finch's journal and then find a way to fix the two of you."
Scrooge says: "Fix us?"
Scrooge says: "We're right as rain."
Webby says: "What?"
Webby says: "I thought you hated young people."
Webby says: "Besides, nobody stays young forever."
Goldie says: "Psst."
Goldie says: "Let's ditch Old Lady Vanderquack and stay young forever."
Scrooge says: "Ah, we can't leave Webby."
Webby says: "Nah!"
Webby says: "A mosquito stung my eye!"
Webby says: "Ah!"
Goldie says: "We spent our whole lives at each other's throats, Scroogy."
Goldie says: "But what if we could do it all over again, knowing everything we know now, avoiding the same mistakes?"
Goldie says: "This is our chance at a fresh start."
Scrooge says: "Youth is wasted on the young, but not on us!"
Scrooge says: "No, no no no, this is ridiculous."
Scrooge says: "I'm proud of my age."
Scrooge says: "Being old isn't so bad, right?"
Webby says: "I'll get you, you noisome gnats!"
Webby says: "Curse me kilts."
Webby says: "Ow!"
Scrooge says: "Okay."
Scrooge says: "Let's find that fountain."
Webby says: "Wait, where are you going?"
Goldie says: "Were gonna be young forever!"
Goldie says: "See you, geezer!"
Webby says: "Geezer?"
Webby says: "I'm still younger than you!"
Webby says: "Come back here, you irresponsible reprobates!"
Scrooge says: "Ah, come on."
Scrooge says: "Keep following the stream."
Goldie says: "But according to the journal, it should be right..."
Goldie says: "The Fountain of the Foreverglades!"
Scrooge says: "Huh!"
Scrooge says: "I guess the fountain doesn't feed the river after all."
Scrooge says: "But then how did we get younger?"
Goldie says: "Who cares?"
Goldie says: "Let's nab us some youth juice!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Well, well, well."
John D Rockerduck says: "McDuck and O'Gilt."
John D Rockerduck says: "Once again there is nothing you possess that John D Rockerduck cannot take away."
John D Rockerduck says: "Jeeves, take it away from them."
Scrooge says: "John Rockerduck?"
Scrooge says: "I thought you died ages ago!"
Goldie says: "How are you alive?"
Goldie says: "You're so..."
Goldie says: "soft!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Millions of dollars in experimental freezing technology."
John D Rockerduck says: "While you two were staying young through  hard work, I paid good money for my youth."
Goldie says: "Hope you kept the receipt."
John D Rockerduck says: "Yes, well, I did say experimental, but the water in the fountain will finally restore my youthful vitality."
Scrooge says: "I gave this fellah a walloping a hundred years ago."
Scrooge says: "Guess it's about time for another."
Scrooge says: "OW!"
Goldie says: "Scroogey!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Jeeves, bottle that youth tonic so that I might restore my vim and vigor."
John D Rockerduck says: "Empty?"
John D Rockerduck says: "Who took all my youth tonic?"
Huey says: "Ugh!"
Huey says: "Oh, excuse me."
Inn manager says: "Think nothing of it."
Louie says: "Oh, that's It!"
Huey says: "What's what?"
Dewey says: "What's what?"
Louie says: "That's Ponce de León."
Louie says: "He's been using the Fountain of Youth to turn young people old and keep the youth for himself."
Louie says: "Just figured it out."
Inn manager says: "I always said youth was wasted on the young."
Inn manager says: "So, give my yours."
Ponce de León says: "For a trio of disgusting children, you are abnormally clever."
Louie says: "More pressing matters, Dew."
Ponce de León says: "Years ago, I discovered the waters of the fountain didn't grant youth but rather transferred it."
Ponce de León says: "At first it was easy."
Ponce de León says: "Shove a crew member in, sap their youth, drink it up."
Ponce de León says: "But it got harder to lure people in."
Ponce de León says: "Nobody wants to follow a creepy old man into a swamp."
Ponce de León says: "So, I drained the fountain waters into the pool and opened this resort to ensnare simple-minded teens."
Huey says: "So..."
Huey says: "Dewey's not oldest."
Huey says: "When he dipped his toe in the water, he supernaturally aged."
Dewey says: "Supernaturally oldest is still oldest!"
Huey says: "Why are you telling us this?"
Ponce de León says: "Heh heh, when I'm done with you, you'll be too old to remember any of it."
Ponce de León says: "Yah!"
Goldie says: "If there's no fountain water, how did we de-age?"
Goldie says: "Unless it wasn't the river that did it."
Scrooge says: "Ah!"
Scrooge says: "Little help here?"
John D Rockerduck says: "Ha!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Taste that supple Italian leather, pauper!"
Scrooge says: "Ah!"
Scrooge says: "Ugh!"
Goldie says: "Ah!"
Goldie says: "What could it be?"
Goldie says: "We didn't have any other water: Scrooge: Could you think a little faster, dear?"
Goldie says: "I'm kind of in a bind here."
Goldie says: "The canteen!"
Goldie says: "The hotel water!"
Scrooge says: "Goldie!"
Goldie says: "Sorry, old habit!"
Scrooge says: "Uwah!"
Ponce de León says: "Oh, can't keep a customer waiting."
Ponce de León says: "This may be a trap for tourists, but it doesn't have to be a tourist trap."
The boys try to escape, but get caught in an inner tube.
Ponce de León says: "There!"
Ponce de León says: "I'll steel your youth, then I'll charge you for the float rental!"
Dewey says: "Don't worry, your big brother's got this."
Dewey says: "I'll bite a hole in this floatie and we'll make our escape."
Ponce de León says: "Checking in for spring break?"
Scrooge says: "What did you do with the Fountain of Youth?"
Ponce de León says: "What is it with kids figuring me out today?"
Springbreaker says: "Oh no, I slept in!"
Springbreaker says: "Spring break!"
Springbreaker says: "Whoo!"
Scrooge says: "Oh, the fountain water is in the pool!"
Goldie says: "But where does it go?"
Scrooge and Goldie watch as the swimmer ages in front of them. Ponce de León takes a sip from a canteen and his mane loses its gray color.
Ponce de León says: "Ah!"
Goldie says: "Ew, gross!"
Goldie says: "We drank nasty pool people juice?"
Ponce de León says: "I filter it."
Ponce de León says: "After all, we are a five-star resort."
Ponce de León fights both Scrooge and Goldie and gets pinched by both of them.
Ponce de León says: "Now, now, I can see you two aren't normal teenagers."
Ponce de León says: "But perhaps you'd like to be..."
Ponce de León says: "forever?"
Ponce de León says: "Join me, and you too can benefit from the fountain's waters."
Goldie says: "A fresh start, Scroogie."
Goldie says: "You and me, forever."
Springbreaker says: "What happened?"
Springbreaker says: "I was just on spring break."
Scrooge says: "He's stealing youth, Goldie."
Scrooge says: "I earned each wrinkle square."
Scrooge says: "It's not fair to pawn them off on someone else."
Scrooge says: "Not even a teenager."
Goldie says: "Scrooge."
Scrooge says: "What good is erasing past mistakes if we're just to make worse ones?"
Scrooge says: "I can't."
John D Rockerduck says: "But I can!"
John D Rockerduck says: "-AH!"
Ponce de León says: "Pool rule number four: no running!"
Ponce de León says: "This is my Fountain of Youth, and I'm not giving it up!"
Goldie says: "Ah!"
Goldie says: "Bingo!"
Goldie says: "Should be enough water here to last me ages."
Dewey says: "Almost got it."
Huey says: "A spring breaker!"
Louie says: "The hotel owner's turning everyone old!"
Huey says: "Save yourself!"
Goldie says: "I always do."
Scrooge fights both Ponce de León and FrankenJeeves, but is quickly overpowered.
Goldie says: "Pick on someone your own age!"
Kids says: "Ugh!"
Goldie says: "Down the hatch, ya big galoot!"
Scrooge says: "You came back for me."
Goldie says: "Guess I'm not the woman I used to be."
John D Rockerduck says: "Jeeves, attack!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Attack them!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Bellyache and botheration."
John D Rockerduck says: "The bellows on that babe!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Pipe down!"
Rockerduck picks up infant Jeeves who stops crying.
John D Rockerduck says: "Man alive, are all infants this heavy or just the Frankenstein ones?"
Ponce de León says: "You fools!"
Ponce de León says: "You don't deserve eternal youth!"
Ponce de León says: "Ah!"
Scrooge and Goldie disarm Ponce de León in a coordinated attack.
Goldie says: "We may not be young forever."
Scrooge says: "But we can make the most of the time we've got."
Scrooge says: "Give it up."
Scrooge says: "There's nowhere else to go!"
Ponce de León falls into the pool and grabs Scrooge with him.
Scrooge says: "Ah!"
Goldie says: "Scrooge!"
Goldie says: "Scrooge, you gotta get outta there!"
Scrooge says: "I'm..."
Scrooge says: "trying..."
Scrooge says: "But..."
Scrooge says: "your fresh start."
Goldie says: "A fresh start isn't worth it without you, you crazy old coot."
Ponce de León says: "No!"
Ponce de León says: "My precious youth!"
Kids says: "Uwah!"
Dewey says: "Nailed it!"
Louie says: "Oh man, someone's gonna need to clean that pool."
Springbreaker says: "Spring break!"
Louie says: "That's the last of the youth water."
Webby says: "Eh, you young'uns don't appreciate what you have."
Dewey says: "Yes Webby, I appreciate my youth now."
Dewey says: "Huey, you are the big brother again."
Huey says: "I always was."
Dewey says: "Here you go, Webby."
Dewey says: "Your turn."
Dewey says: "You look terrible."
Webby says: "What?"
Webby says: "I didn't age."
Webby says: "I just had a bad day!"
Webby says: "Ah, that's better."
Webby says: "Hey, where's Goldie?"
Scrooge says: "Probably off to find her next mark."
Scrooge says: "You know Goldie."
Goldie says: "Hey, I wouldn't leave without saying goodbye..."
Goldie says: "this time."
Goldie hands the journal back to Scrooge and kisses him.
Scrooge says: "Ah!"
Goldie says: "Spring break!"
