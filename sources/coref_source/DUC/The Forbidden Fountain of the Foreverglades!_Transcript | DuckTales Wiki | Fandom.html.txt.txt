Episode Info says: "Transcript: Gallery: Clips: Inn manager: Five hundred years ago, Spanish explorer Ponce de Le√≥n set out to find the Fabled Fountain of the Foreverglades said to grant youth to all who drink from it."
Episode Info says: "The fountain may be a legend, but you can experience the rejuvenation of youth here at the Conquistador Inn where the years simply melt away."
Springbreaker says: "Spring Break!"
Springbreaker says: "Woo!"
Scrooge says: "Spring Break?"
Scrooge says: "Boo!"
Scrooge says: "Youth is wasted on the young."
Webby says: "Aw c'mon, Uncle Scrooge."
Webby says: "I'm sure these teens have had a very difficult academic year and deserve to blow off steam."
Scrooge says: "At their age, I couldn't afford to blow off steam."
Scrooge says: "I had to use it to turn my Uncle Porthole's steamboat because I had a job."
Louie says: "Wait, if you hate young people, why are we staying at a hotel full of them?"
Scrooge says: "Because, it's near the last known location of the Fountain of the Foreverglades."
Huey says: "Which is the next missing mystery of Isabella Finch."
Scrooge says: "Also it was cheap."
Springbreaker says: "Spring Break!"
Inn manager says: "Along with a great price, we offer a world-class spa and a crystal clear pool for the whole family, all surrounded by  casual elegance."
Webby says: "C'mon, let's go!"
Webby says: "That youth fountain ain't getting any younger!"
Scrooge says: "Ach!"
Scrooge says: "My back is killing me."
Scrooge says: "I need to ice it and prep for a morning start."
Scrooge says: "Do not disturb me."
Huey says: "A free afternoon, eh?"
Huey says: "Luckily, I've scheduled it down to the minute."
Dewey says: "How?"
Dewey says: "You just found out we had a free afternoon!"
Scrooge says: "Good thinking, lad."
Scrooge says: "Huey's in charge."
Scrooge says: "He's oldest."
Dewey says: "We are triplets!"
Dewey says: "Huey's always in charge."
Huey says: "We better change into our suits if we're going to fit in a swim before lunch."
Dewey says: "Stupid being second oldest."
Scrooge says: "Now for a little peace and..."
Goldie says: "Knock it off, you pool-floatin' showboaters!"
Goldie says: "Fancy meeting me here."
opening theme says: "Webby: Goldie O'Gilt!"
Scrooge says: "No, no, no, no!"
Goldie says: "Oh yes!"
Goldie says: "Yes, yes, yes, yes!"
Scrooge says: "What are you doing here, you savings swindling swine?"
Goldie says: "Definitely not jumping your claim to the fountain before you."
Webby says: "But that's not..."
Webby says: "you..."
Webby says: "that's cheating!"
Goldie says: "No I believe that's  workin' smarter while you work harder, eh Scrooogey?"
Scrooge says: "Without Finch's journal, you'll never find the..."
Goldie says: "The old guy's giving out free t-shirts!"
Scrooge says: "Unhand me!"
Scrooge says: "Ah!"
Webby says: "What about the boys?"
Scrooge says: "No time!"
Scrooge says: "If Goldie beats me to that fountain, I'll have to hear about it for the next hundred years!"
Dewey says: "Why does being hatched three seconds earlier automatically make you in charge of everything?"
Huey says: "Because the oldest is in charge, That's just how it goes."
Louie says: "Ugh!"
Louie says: "Guys, this is my one afternoon to Louie out at a luxury resort before we almost die in a swamp."
Dewey says: "I'm hitting the pool."
Huey says: "Woah, woah, woah."
Huey says: "Pool's too busy now."
Huey says: "We're scheduled to relax next to the pool."
Dewey says: "Nerp!"
Dewey says: "Dewing it now!"
Dewey says: "Spring break!"
Springbreaker says: "Whoo!"
Dewey says: "Gnah!"
Dewey says: "Spring..."
Dewey says: "break?"
Dewey says: "Aw, man..."
Huey says: "If you're done, next on the schedule: relaxing."
Dewey says: "How about a vote?"
Dewey says: "I vote no."
Dewey says: "Louie?"
Webby says: "Hah!"
Webby says: "Take that, Goldie!"
Webby says: "We're gonna beat her."
Webby says: "Uncle Scrooge?"
Goldie says: "Back problems?"
Scrooge says: "Not so bad I can't best you, you AAHH!"
Goldie says: "Getting old is a pain in the keister."
Goldie says: "Literally."
Webby says: "Should we take a time out, or..."
Scrooge says: "I just need some water."
Goldie says: "Ah, too bad you don't have any."
Scrooge says: "Grr."
Goldie says: "Oh please."
Goldie says: "I stole this water from the hotel fair and square."
Scrooge says: "Aye, but you stole that canteen from me on Oak Island in '73."
Scrooge says: "Give it here!"
Goldie says: "I took it as payback after that bridge snapped and you let me fall."
Scrooge says: "You cut the bridge."
Webby says: "You two have so much history."
Scrooge says: "Aye, full of betrayal."
Goldie says: "Why stop now?"
Goldie says: "Ha!"
Webby says: "Aw, so cute."
Webby says: "I can't wait to get old."
Huey says: "And..."
Huey says: "relaxed."
Huey says: "Right on schedule."
Dewey says: "What are you guys staring at?"
Louie says: "Dewey, are you taller?"
Dewey says: "What?"
Dewey says: "I must have hit a growth spurt."
Huey says: "Hm, that's crazy."
Huey says: "You hatched after me."
Dewey says: "Well, Hubert."
Dewey says: "Maybe my egg was laid first, ergo vis-a-vis, it is I who am big brother now."
Huey says: "That's not how biology works."
Dewey says: "It is now, because big brother is in charge!"
Dewey says: "I'll take that."
Dewey says: "Yoink!"
Huey says: "Ah!"
Huey says: "curse my too short limbs!"
Scrooge says: "How're your knees holding up?"
Scrooge says: "Ow!"
Goldie says: "Better than your back."
Webby says: "The fountain is so close!"
Webby says: "Don't let her get under your skin!"
Goldie says: "Yeah, don't let me get under your wrinkly old skin, Scroogey!"
Goldie says: "Oh!"
Scrooge says: "Ah!"
Webby says: "Uncle Scrooge!"
Webby says: "And Goldie, too, I guess."
Webby says: "Hup!"
Webby says: "Guh!"
Scrooge says: "Bless me bagpipes!"
Goldie says: "Great gobs of goblin spit!"
Goldie says: "You're young!"
Scrooge says: "You're young!"
Scrooge says: "The stream must be fed by the Fountain of Youth!"
Scrooge says: "If we follow it, we'll find its source!"
Scrooge says: "Do you know what this means?"
Goldie says: "Yep!"
Goldie says: "Beating you will be so much easier now!"
Goldie says: "Ha!"
Scrooge says: "Ah ha ha ha!"
Webby says: "Hey!"
Webby says: "Wait up!"
Webby says: "Wow!"
Webby says: "You are fast now!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Finally, the fountain will be mine."
John D Rockerduck says: "Thus begins the revenge of John D Rockerduck."
John D Rockerduck says: "Ah ha ha ha ha ha!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Now fan me."
Scrooge says: "Not so old now, am I?"
Goldie says: "Not at all."
Goldie says: "I'd forgotten how almost attractive you used to be."
Scrooge says: "Really?"
Scrooge says: "Oh!"
Goldie says: "Ha ha!"
Goldie says: "Young Scrooge falling for the same old tricks."
Scrooge says: "Ha ha!"
Scrooge says: "It is on!"
Scrooge says: "I haven't felt this spry in ages!"
Webby says: "What?"
Webby says: "No!"
Webby says: "Your cane is part of your mystique!"
Scrooge says: "I love being Young!"
Scrooge says: "Whoo!"
Webby says: "Wait!"
Webby says: "Come back!"
Dewey says: "As your "big" brother, I'm obviously wiser."
Dewey says: "So, forget the schedule."
Dewey says: "Let's go nuts!"
Dewey says: "Lunchtime!"
Dewey says: "Since the spring breakers are in the pool, we'll eat before the..."
Dewey says: "huh?"
Dewey says: "..."
Dewey says: "rush?"
Huey says: "Oh, weird."
Huey says: "Old people eat early?"
Huey says: "In Florida?"
Huey says: "If only the big brother had done his research!"
Dewey says: "Big brother eats first."
Dewey says: "Where did all these seniors come from anyway?"
Inn manager says: "This hotel caters to the young, and to the young at heart."
Louie says: "That's code for old people."
Inn manager says: "Now, who wants more gelatin?"
Senior says: "Whoo!"
Louie says: "Hm."
Webby says: "Careful, you newly young whippersnappers, If you fall into this stream again, you could be young forever."
Goldie says: "Oh no, what a terrible fate."
Webby says: "Just follow me."
Webby says: "Easy..."
Scrooge says: "Ugh!"
Scrooge says: "Ha ha ha ha!"
Webby says: "What are you doing?"
Webby says: "That's dangerous!"
Goldie says: "Who cares?"
Goldie says: "Hah!"
Goldie says: "I'm young and invincible!"
Goldie says: "You..."
Goldie says: "caught me."
Scrooge says: "Was I supposed to let you fall?"
Goldie says: "You did on Oak Island."
Scrooge says: "I guess I'm not the man I used to be."
Webby says: "Ooh, you repellent reptilian rogue!"
Scrooge says: "We better be off."
Goldie says: "Yep, gotta find that fountain."
Webby says: "Ngah!"
Webby says: "Ow, ow..."
Dewey says: "Okay, I know we didn't get dessert and we had to rush through the spa treatments, but we have plenty of time to get our hair beaded."
Dewey says: "Best big brother ever!"
Huey says: "If only we had some kind of list of times and events that told us what to do."
Dewey says: "Show some respect for your elder."
Huey says: "You're not the oldest, just the tallest!"
Dewey says: "You're just jealous because I'm a better big brother than you."
Huey says: "Maybe if you had to deal with a middle brother like..."
Huey says: "you."
Huey says: "You're the "Huey."
Huey says: "" Fine, then I'm the Dewey, and I wanna play."
Dewey says: "But, but the bead station closes in five minutes."
Huey says: "Who cares about the schedule, right?"
Huey says: "Let's "Hue" this."
Huey says: "Hyah!"
Louie goes to refill his drink while Huey and Dewey play ping-pong. He notices the inn manager filling up a canteen, and locking the door with a key, a padlock, and a combination lock.
Louie says: "Hm..."
Webby says: "Alright, once we find that fountain, we'll log it into Finch's journal and then find a way to fix the two of you."
Scrooge says: "Fix us?"
Scrooge says: "We're right as rain."
Webby says: "What?"
Webby says: "I thought you hated young people."
Webby says: "Besides, nobody stays young forever."
Goldie says: "Psst."
Goldie says: "Let's ditch Old Lady Vanderquack and stay young forever."
Scrooge says: "Ah, we can't leave Webby."
Webby says: "Nah!"
Webby says: "A mosquito stung my eye!"
Webby says: "Ah!"
Goldie says: "We spent our whole lives at each other's throats, Scroogy."
Goldie says: "But what if we could do it all over again, knowing everything we know now, avoiding the same mistakes?"
Goldie says: "This is our chance at a fresh start."
Scrooge says: "Youth is wasted on the young, but not on us!"
Scrooge says: "No, no no no, this is ridiculous."
Scrooge says: "I'm proud of my age."
Scrooge says: "Being old isn't so bad, right?"
Webby says: "I'll get you, you noisome gnats!"
Webby says: "Curse me kilts."
Webby says: "Ow!"
Scrooge says: "Okay."
Scrooge says: "Let's find that fountain."
Webby says: "Wait, where are you going?"
Goldie says: "Were gonna be young forever!"
Goldie says: "See you, geezer!"
Webby says: "Geezer?"
Webby says: "I'm still younger than you!"
Webby says: "Come back here, you irresponsible reprobates!"
Scrooge says: "Ah, come on."
Scrooge says: "Keep following the stream."
Goldie says: "But according to the journal, it should be right..."
Goldie says: "The Fountain of the Foreverglades!"
Scrooge says: "Huh!"
Scrooge says: "I guess the fountain doesn't feed the river after all."
Scrooge says: "But then how did we get younger?"
Goldie says: "Who cares?"
Goldie says: "Let's nab us some youth juice!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Well, well, well."
John D Rockerduck says: "McDuck and O'Gilt."
John D Rockerduck says: "Once again there is nothing you possess that John D Rockerduck cannot take away."
John D Rockerduck says: "Jeeves, take it away from them."
Scrooge says: "John Rockerduck?"
Scrooge says: "I thought you died ages ago!"
Goldie says: "How are you alive?"
Goldie says: "You're so..."
Goldie says: "soft!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Millions of dollars in experimental freezing technology."
John D Rockerduck says: "While you two were staying young through  hard work, I paid good money for my youth."
Goldie says: "Hope you kept the receipt."
John D Rockerduck says: "Yes, well, I did say experimental, but the water in the fountain will finally restore my youthful vitality."
Scrooge says: "I gave this fellah a walloping a hundred years ago."
Scrooge says: "Guess it's about time for another."
Scrooge says: "OW!"
Goldie says: "Scroogey!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Jeeves, bottle that youth tonic so that I might restore my vim and vigor."
John D Rockerduck says: "Empty?"
John D Rockerduck says: "Who took all my youth tonic?"
Huey says: "Ugh!"
Huey says: "Oh, excuse me."
Inn manager says: "Think nothing of it."
Louie says: "Oh, that's It!"
Huey says: "What's what?"
Dewey says: "What's what?"
Louie says: "That's Ponce de Le√≥n."
Louie says: "He's been using the Fountain of Youth to turn young people old and keep the youth for himself."
Louie says: "Just figured it out."
Inn manager says: "I always said youth was wasted on the young."
Inn manager says: "So, give my yours."
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "For a trio of disgusting children, you are abnormally clever."
Louie says: "More pressing matters, Dew."
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "Years ago, I discovered the waters of the fountain didn't grant youth but rather transferred it."
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "At first it was easy."
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "Shove a crew member in, sap their youth, drink it up."
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "But it got harder to lure people in."
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "Nobody wants to follow a creepy old man into a swamp."
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "So, I drained the fountain waters into the pool and opened this resort to ensnare simple-minded teens."
Huey says: "So..."
Huey says: "Dewey's not oldest."
Huey says: "When he dipped his toe in the water, he supernaturally aged."
Dewey says: "Supernaturally oldest is still oldest!"
Huey says: "Why are you telling us this?"
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "Heh heh, when I'm done with you, you'll be too old to remember any of it."
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "Yah!"
Goldie says: "If there's no fountain water, how did we de-age?"
Goldie says: "Unless it wasn't the river that did it."
Scrooge says: "Ah!"
Scrooge says: "Little help here?"
John D Rockerduck says: "Ha!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Taste that supple Italian leather, pauper!"
Scrooge says: "Ah!"
Scrooge says: "Ugh!"
Goldie says: "Ah!"
Goldie says: "What could it be?"
Goldie says: "We didn't have any other water: Scrooge: Could you think a little faster, dear?"
Goldie says: "I'm kind of in a bind here."
Goldie says: "The canteen!"
Goldie says: "The hotel water!"
Scrooge says: "Goldie!"
Goldie says: "Sorry, old habit!"
Scrooge says: "Uwah!"
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "Oh, can't keep a customer waiting."
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "This may be a trap for tourists, but it doesn't have to be a tourist trap."
The boys try to escape, but get caught in an inner tube.
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "There!"
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "I'll steel your youth, then I'll charge you for the float rental!"
Dewey says: "Don't worry, your big brother's got this."
Dewey says: "I'll bite a hole in this floatie and we'll make our escape."
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "Checking in for spring break?"
Scrooge says: "What did you do with the Fountain of Youth?"
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "What is it with kids figuring me out today?"
Springbreaker says: "Oh no, I slept in!"
Springbreaker says: "Spring break!"
Springbreaker says: "Whoo!"
Scrooge says: "Oh, the fountain water is in the pool!"
Goldie says: "But where does it go?"
Scrooge and Goldie watch as the swimmer ages in front of them. Ponce de Le√≥n takes a sip from a canteen and his mane loses its gray color.
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "Ah!"
Goldie says: "Ew, gross!"
Goldie says: "We drank nasty pool people juice?"
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "I filter it."
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "After all, we are a five-star resort."
Ponce de Le√≥n fights both Scrooge and Goldie and gets pinched by both of them.
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "Now, now, I can see you two aren't normal teenagers."
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "But perhaps you'd like to be..."
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "forever?"
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "Join me, and you too can benefit from the fountain's waters."
Goldie says: "A fresh start, Scroogie."
Goldie says: "You and me, forever."
Springbreaker says: "What happened?"
Springbreaker says: "I was just on spring break."
Scrooge says: "He's stealing youth, Goldie."
Scrooge says: "I earned each wrinkle square."
Scrooge says: "It's not fair to pawn them off on someone else."
Scrooge says: "Not even a teenager."
Goldie says: "Scrooge."
Scrooge says: "What good is erasing past mistakes if we're just to make worse ones?"
Scrooge says: "I can't."
John D Rockerduck says: "But I can!"
John D Rockerduck says: "-AH!"
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "Pool rule number four: no running!"
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "This is my Fountain of Youth, and I'm not giving it up!"
Goldie says: "Ah!"
Goldie says: "Bingo!"
Goldie says: "Should be enough water here to last me ages."
Dewey says: "Almost got it."
Huey says: "A spring breaker!"
Louie says: "The hotel owner's turning everyone old!"
Huey says: "Save yourself!"
Goldie says: "I always do."
Scrooge fights both Ponce de Le√≥n and FrankenJeeves, but is quickly overpowered.
Goldie says: "Pick on someone your own age!"
Kids says: "Ugh!"
Goldie says: "Down the hatch, ya big galoot!"
Scrooge says: "You came back for me."
Goldie says: "Guess I'm not the woman I used to be."
John D Rockerduck says: "Jeeves, attack!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Attack them!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Bellyache and botheration."
John D Rockerduck says: "The bellows on that babe!"
John D Rockerduck says: "Pipe down!"
Rockerduck picks up infant Jeeves who stops crying.
John D Rockerduck says: "Man alive, are all infants this heavy or just the Frankenstein ones?"
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "You fools!"
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "You don't deserve eternal youth!"
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "Ah!"
Scrooge and Goldie disarm Ponce de Le√≥n in a coordinated attack.
Goldie says: "We may not be young forever."
Scrooge says: "But we can make the most of the time we've got."
Scrooge says: "Give it up."
Scrooge says: "There's nowhere else to go!"
Ponce de Le√≥n falls into the pool and grabs Scrooge with him.
Scrooge says: "Ah!"
Goldie says: "Scrooge!"
Goldie says: "Scrooge, you gotta get outta there!"
Scrooge says: "I'm..."
Scrooge says: "trying..."
Scrooge says: "But..."
Scrooge says: "your fresh start."
Goldie says: "A fresh start isn't worth it without you, you crazy old coot."
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "No!"
Ponce de Le√≥n says: "My precious youth!"
Kids says: "Uwah!"
Dewey says: "Nailed it!"
Louie says: "Oh man, someone's gonna need to clean that pool."
Springbreaker says: "Spring break!"
Louie says: "That's the last of the youth water."
Webby says: "Eh, you young'uns don't appreciate what you have."
Dewey says: "Yes Webby, I appreciate my youth now."
Dewey says: "Huey, you are the big brother again."
Huey says: "I always was."
Dewey says: "Here you go, Webby."
Dewey says: "Your turn."
Dewey says: "You look terrible."
Webby says: "What?"
Webby says: "I didn't age."
Webby says: "I just had a bad day!"
Webby says: "Ah, that's better."
Webby says: "Hey, where's Goldie?"
Scrooge says: "Probably off to find her next mark."
Scrooge says: "You know Goldie."
Goldie says: "Hey, I wouldn't leave without saying goodbye..."
Goldie says: "this time."
Goldie hands the journal back to Scrooge and kisses him.
Scrooge says: "Ah!"
Goldie says: "Spring break!"
