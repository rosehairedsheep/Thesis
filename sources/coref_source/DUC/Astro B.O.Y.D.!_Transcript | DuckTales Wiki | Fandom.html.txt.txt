Launchpad says: "All right, Woodchucks!"
Launchpad says: "Happy national s'more day!"
Launchpad says: "A very real holiday, according to one source on the internet."
Launchpad says: "Let's get mallowing!"
Junior Woodchucks says: "Yay!"
Huey says: "Okay, 0."
Huey says: "8 ounces marshmallow, for every one 2/3 quarter inch graham cracker squares, three minutes per s'more."
Huey says: "If we keep s'mores at 1."
Huey says: "6 ounces of chocolate per cracker, then we'll have..."
Huey says: "the perfect s'more!"
Bully Beagle says: "Bleep Blop!"
Bully Beagle says: "I make food for robotic consumption!"
Huey says: "Careful!"
Huey says: "Those roasting sticks have been cut according to specific junior woodchuck guidelines."
Bully Beagle says: "I'm adding donuts and cookie dough!"
Huey says: "But..."
Huey says: "That's not in the recipe!"
Bully Beagle says: "Huebot engage!"
Bully Beagle says: "Uh oh!"
Bully Beagle says: "Need oil can-can-can."
Huey says: "Not even a modern robot."
Bully Beagle says: "Try being a kid for once, Huebot!"
The Junior Woodchuck Scouts walk away laughing.
Huey says: "Guys- guys!"
Huey says: "That's not a textbook..."
Huey says: "smore."
Huey begins to pick up the sticks around him says: "B."
until he meets B.O.Y.D. says: "B."
Huey begins to pick up the sticks around him says: "O."

Huey begins to pick up the sticks around him says: ": Wow!"
until he meets B.O.Y.D. says: ": Wow!"
Huey begins to pick up the sticks around him says: "These roasting sticks are cut precisely to woodchuck guidelines!"
until he meets B.O.Y.D. says: "These roasting sticks are cut precisely to woodchuck guidelines!"
Huey says: "Yes!"
Huey says: "Thank you."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Hi!"
B.O.Y.D. says: "I'm Boyd, A definitely real boy!"
Huey says: "Um."
Huey says: "I'm Huey, also real."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Would you like to be friends?"
Huey says: "Sure!"
Huey says: "Wow, that was easy."
Huey says: "B."
Huey says: "O."
Huey says: "Y."
Huey says: "D."
Huey says: ", why don't you start the campfire?"
B.O.Y.D. says: "Absolutely, pal!"
B.O.Y.D says: "Leads to carefree, fun-time leisure!"
Huey says: "Leads to carefree, fun-time leisure!"
Huey says: "You've memorized the guidebook too?"
B.O.Y.D. says: "Practically downloaded it in my head!"
Huey says: "Yes!"
Huey says: "There's nothing wrong with doing things exactly the right way."
Huey says: "That doesn't make us robots."
Huey says: "We're just kids."
B.O.Y.D says: "Definitely!"
Huey says: "You get me, B."
Huey says: "O."
Huey says: "Y."
Huey says: "D."
Huey says: ", We're a rare breed, you and I."
B.O.Y.D begins to glitch out, having a flashback of sorts.
Dr. Akita says: "You are a rare breed."
B.O.Y.D.'s laser eyes activate once more says: "Cut to the Undersea Lab."
shooting at two trees to the point that they fall down. The lasers harm most of the camp says: "Cut to the Undersea Lab."
as well says: "Cut to the Undersea Lab."

Huey says: "Hey, Fenton, is Dr."
Huey says: "Gearloose around?"
Huey says: "We've got a, uh, glitchy piece of tech here."
Fenton says: "Huey, I'm more than an intern, I'm a scientist."
Fenton says: "I can easily assist you with all of your scientific needs!"
Fenton says: "Who's your friend?"
B.O.Y.D says: "Hi!"
B.O.Y.D removes his hands from his face, which causes his laser eyes to go off once more. Fenton quickly puts red-tinted glasses on him.
Fenton says: "I'll..."
Fenton says: "get Dr."
Fenton says: "Gearloose."
Cut to Gyro's work area. Fenton approaches him.
Fenton says: "Dr."
Fenton says: "Gearloose?"
Gyro says: "Intern."
Fenton says: "Can we have a word?"
Gyro says: "Oh!"
Gyro says: "Here's two!"
Gyro says: "Leave."
Gyro says: "Now."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Dr."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Gearloose?"
Gyro says: "Where did you get that thing?!"
Gyro says: "!"
B.O.Y.D. says: "I haven't seen you since..."
B.O.Y.D. says: "I can't remember."
Gyro says: "Manny!"
Gyro says: "Get this dangerous machine out of my lab!"
Manny says: "Which one?"
Huey says: "You know my friend, B."
Huey says: "O."
Huey says: "Y."
Huey says: "D?"
Gyro says: "B."
Gyro says: "O."
Gyro says: "Y."
Gyro says: "D?"
Gyro says: "What idiot called it that?"
Gyro says: "It's name is 2-BO."
Gyro says: "And yes, I know all about it."
Gyro says: "It is not your friend, it is not a boy, it is a failed experiment!"
Gyro says: "I helped built 2-BO, years ago in Tokyolk."
Gyro says: "When I was just a lowly intern for the infamous Dr."
Gyro says: "Akita."
Fenton says: "You were an intern like me?"
Gyro says: "Nothing like you."
Huey says: "Great!"
Huey says: "You can fix him then!"
Gyro opens up B.O.Y.D's chest plate to inspect it.
Gyro says: "Ah!"
Gyro says: "2-BO's hard-drive is a mess!"
Gyro says: "I can stop the glitches for now, but it's been overwritten so many times, I can't get to it's core to fix the problem!"
Gyro sighs, and walks over to one of the large glass windows.
Gyro says: "I swore I'd never go back, but left in this state 2-BO could endanger us all."
Gyro says: "There's only one place that has the equipment we'll need; my mentor's old lab."
B.O.Y.D, Huey, and Fenton all make various declarations of excitement.
Gyro says: "From it."
Huey says: "Aren't you overreacting?"
Huey says: "Look at him!"
Huey says: "He's a kid, like me!"
Huey says: "Just..."
Huey says: "wired a little differently."
Huey says: "Besides, dozens of your inventions have tried to kill us, and you always say they're 'wildly misunderstood'!"
Gyro says: "I understand 2-BO all too well."
Gyro says: "Don't..."
Gyro says: "get too close to it."
Cuts to title card, then to Gyro, Fenton, B.O.Y.D, and Huey walking around Tokyolk.
Gyro says: "Remember, no one can know we're here."
Gyro says: "We have to remain discreet."
Right after he says this, a police car pulls up. Inspector Tezuka steps out of it.
Tezuka says: "Gearloose!"
Gyro says: "Oh no."
Gyro says: "Hide 2-BO."
Gyro says: "Ah!"
Gyro says: "Inspector Tezuka!"
Gyro says: "Konichiwa, what are you doing in Tokyo-  Ow!"
Tezuka says: "Keeping it safe from evil robots."
Tezuka says: "You got a lot of nerve showing your metal-loving mug around here."
Gyro says: "We both know I was cleared for those crimes- Agh, ow!"
Huey says: "Crimes?"
Tezuka says: "But your mentor, Dr."
Tezuka says: "Akita wasn't, so where are you hiding him?!"
Tezuka says: "!"
Gyro says: "I haven't seen Akita since he disappeared!"
Tezuka looks towards Huey says: "Gyro: Important..."
Fenton as they try to hide B.O.Y.D. says: "Gyro: Important..."
Tezuka looks towards Huey says: "field trip."
Fenton as they try to hide B.O.Y.D. says: "field trip."
Tezuka says: "You, bright eyes!"
Tezuka says: "What did you say your name was?"
B.O.Y.D. says: "I'm B."
B.O.Y.D. says: "O."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Y."
B.O.Y.D. says: "D, A definitely real boy!"
Just as Tezuka gets suspicious of him, Lil bulb distracts her by spray painting some nearby vending machines. She chases after it.
Tezuka says: "Robot!"
Tezuka says: "Stop in the name of the law!"
Gyro says: "Let's keep moving."
Gyro says: "Quickly, quickly!"
In the next scene, everyone is standing outside of an abandoned building.
Huey says: "Wait, we're not gonna break in here?"
Gyro says: "Of course we're not."
Gyro says: "Gizmoduck, break through the door."
Fenton goes towards the door, calling for part of the gizmoduck suit.
Fenton says: "For science!"
Fenton says: "Blah!"
Fenton says: "Easy..."
Fenton says: "Easy..."
He blows through the door, coughing.
Fenton says: "Easy."
They all enter the building, looking around.
B.O.Y.D. says: "This place is so familiar..."
Huey says: "What is all this?"
Gyro says: "It was Tokyolk's most advanced research lab."
Gyro says: "This is where 2-BO was built."
Fenton says: "And where Dr."
Fenton says: "Gyro Gearloose was born!"
Fenton says: "Was this your lab coat?"
Fenton says: "Was this your stool?"
Fenton says: "Was this your trinocular inverted metallurgical microscope?"
Fenton says: "Ah- Dust in my eye, the dust- aha- of genius!"
Gyro says: "Alright!"
Gyro says: "Knock it off, intern."
Gyro says: "Let's get to work."
Gyro unveils a machine that looks like a chair We have to search through all of 2-BO's memories and programming to get to it's core.
Gyro says: "Then, I can stop this malfunctioning for good."
Huey says: "No need to be scared!"
Huey says: "Just a normal check-up where we jam wires into your computer to view your digital memories and- okay, this is not even a little normal."
Gyro says: "We'll analyze 2-BO's memories with it's previous owners, starting with the newest ones."
The screen proceeds to show a number of B.O.Y.D's memories.
Doofus Drake says: "No more gravy baths?"
Doofus Drake says: "I'll show her!"
Doofus Drake says: "B."
Doofus Drake says: "O."
Doofus Drake says: "Y."
Doofus Drake says: "D!"
Doofus Drake says: "Break this with your robo-muscles!"
B.O.Y.D says: "Don't wanna break anything."
Doofus Drake says: "Then why must you insist on breaking my heart?!"
Doofus Drake says: "!"
B.O.Y.D says: "I'm sorry, do you need a hug?"
Doofus Drake says: "No!"
Gyro switches to the next memory. B.O.Y.D is sitting in what seems to be a pile of garbage.
Mark Beaks says: "Looking through this wreckage, stealin' all the tech and say I made it myself to increase my dumb wealth!"
B.O.Y.D. says: "Pew, pew pew pew pew!"
Mark Beaks says: "No way!"
Mark Beaks says: "A robot boy?"
Mark Beaks says: "Dreams do come true!"
B.O.Y.D says: "Hi, I'm 2-BO, a definitely real boy!"
Mark Beaks says: "Ooh, that's not gonna work for me."
Mark Beaks says: "Let's see, how about.."
Mark Beaks says: "Beaks.."
Mark Beaks says: "Optimistic.."
Mark Beaks says: "Youth..."
Mark Beaks says: "Droid!"
Mark Beaks says: "B."
Mark Beaks says: "O."
Mark Beaks says: "Y."
Mark Beaks says: "D!"
Mark Beaks says: "Yeah!"
B.O.Y.D says: "A real name?"
B.O.Y.D says: "Thank you!"
Mark Beaks says: "Okay, no hugs, chief."
Mark Beaks says: "I do not like touching, and you smell like garbage."
Mark Beaks says: "Now, into the cart you go!"
Cuts back to the present.
Huey says: "Seems like the little guy has had it tough."
Gyro says: "It doesn't feel anything."
Gyro says: "At it's core 2-BO is just a machine."
Lil bulb glows red for a moment before burning out.
Gyro says: "I told you to get a travel adapter!"
Gyro says: "Come on, I'll find you a replacement here somewhere."
Gyro says: "The rest of you, stay put!"
Huey says: "Fenton, do you really think B."
Huey says: "O."
Huey says: "Y."
Huey says: "D is just..."
Huey says: "a dangerous machine?"
Fenton says: "Of course not!"
Fenton says: "He's a machine for good!"
Fenton says: "If we fix his programming, he could be a superhero!"
Fenton says: "Like me!"
Something on the Gizmoduck suit begins to blink red, and a voice comes out of it.
Police Radio says: "Jewelry store robbery in progress."
Police Radio says: "Shinjuku ward."
Fenton says: "Serendipity."
Fenton says: "This is his chance."
Fenton says: "Let's go."
B.O.Y.D. says: "What's going on?"
Fenton says: "Destiny in the making."
Huey says: "I don't know about- woah!"
Fenton says: "In retrospect, we probably should have used the first hole."
Akita says: "A breech at former Akita Labs International."
Akita says: "Hmm, how curious."
Akita says: "Computer, pause boot."
Akita says: "Zoom and enhance."
Akita says: "Woosh."
Akita says: "Intern?"
Akita says: "2."
Akita says: "B."
Akita says: "O."
Akita says: ", welcome back."
A jewelry shop is being robbed by two bikers.
Capsule says: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha."
Clown says: "Ha ha ha."
Fenton says: "Ha hah, this is great."
Fenton says: "I mean it's uh, it's obviously very bad, but great for B."
Fenton says: "O."
Fenton says: "Y."
Fenton says: "D."
Fenton says: "His chance to be a hero."
Fenton says: "Let's go."
Fenton says: "Blathering blatherskite!"
Gizmoduck says: "Woah there, I'll go after the big one, you take the other."
Huey says: "What do we do?"
B.O.Y.D. says: "City bikes, neat and efficient."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Hi, bike thing."
B.O.Y.D. says: "May I borrow one?"
B.O.Y.D. says: "Thank you."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Huey, hop in."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Hurry."
Huey says: "Oh, but what about you?"
B.O.Y.D. says: "My bones are metal."
B.O.Y.D. says: "C'mon."
Huey says: "Woah!"
Gizmoduck says: "Ooh, uh sumimasen."
Gizmoduck says: "Ah!"
Gizmoduck says: "ungh, can't move!"
Gizmoduck says: "Ugh."
Gizmoduck extends his arm through the buildings.
Ramen eater says: "Nani?"
Clown says: "Huh?"
Clown says: "Oof!"
B.O.Y.D. says: "Hi, I'm B."
B.O.Y.D. says: "O."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Y."
B.O.Y.D. says: "D."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Woah."
Huey says: "Look out!"
Capsule spills oil behind her. B.O.Y.D. creates a ramp with his laser eyes and catches up to her alongside the building. Capsule gets distracted and crashes into a trash heap.
Capsule says: "Oof!"
Capsule says: "Ugh."
Huey says: "Woo hoo, Yah hoo!"
B.O.Y.D. says: "So, what do we do now?"
Huey says: "I, do not know."
Capsule says: "Ugh, yah."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Hi, Miss."
B.O.Y.D. says: "I think you mistakenly took something that's not yours."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Could you please return it?"
Capsule says: "Um, no."
Capsule says: "Ha ha ha."
Capsule says: "Later, kid."
Gizmoduck says: "Good work, B."
Gizmoduck says: "O."
Gizmoduck says: "Y."
Gizmoduck says: "D.."
Gizmoduck says: "but you fight the criminal before standing down."
B.O.Y.D. says: "But I don't want want to hurt anybody."
Gizmoduck says: "It's okay."
Gizmoduck says: "First time jitters."
Gizmoduck says: "I'll handle this."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Ugh, ugh."
B.O.Y.D. short circuits and experiences a flashback.
Gyro says: "Some first time jitters but I think."
Akita says: "I'll handle it."
Huey says: "Oh boy, you're glitching."
Huey says: "Let's get you back to the lab."
Huey says: "Where's the lab?"
Gyro says: "Why do we always fight on vacation?"
Gyro says: "Here."
Gyro says: "So idealistic."
Gyro says: "Blah!"
Gyro says: "Alright, let's finish this, and go- HEY!"
Gyro says: "INTERN!!!"
Capsule says: "Ugh!"
Gizmoduck says: "Ah, you caught her."
Gizmoduck says: "Happy to help- Ah!"
Tezuka says: "You're under arrest for suspected mechanical mayhem in conjunction with this robbery, Robot."
Fenton says: "No, stop."
Fenton says: "I'm just a guy with very bruisable skin."
Tezuka says: "Ugh, Gearloose's partner."
Tezuka says: "I should have known."
Fenton says: "What do you have against cybernetic citizens anyway?"
Tezuka says: "Oh I don't know."
Tezuka says: "How about the time Gearloose and Dr."
Tezuka says: "Akita destroyed the city with a robot?"
Fenton says: "What?"
Fenton says: "One of Dr."
Fenton says: "Gearloose's inventions would never..."
Fenton says: "go evil and destroy."
Huey says: "Hah, we're totally lost, and the city is massive."
Huey says: "What do we do?"
B.O.Y.D. says: "What a Junior Woodchuck does best, experience the local culture."
Huey says: "I don't know."
Huey says: "We should really be getting you back to the lab."
B.O.Y.D. says: "We can write down our experiences and analyze them later."
Huey says: "Mmmmmmhmhhhmms, gah!"
Huey says: "I'm in!"
A montage consting of B.O.Y.D. eating ramen, holding kittens, eating ice cream, taking pictures, riding subway, in a cherry tree forest.
Huey says: "And that's where the imperial guard stayed."
Huey says: "I know what you're thinking."
Huey says: "What about ninjas?"
Huey says: "Well, ninjas were all but extinct by- Are you sure you're not bored?"
Huey says: "Usually my brothers are begging me to stop."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Are you kidding?"
B.O.Y.D. says: "I'm having so much fun!"
B.O.Y.D. says: "What an informative day."
B.O.Y.D. and Huey are atop Tokyolk Tower.
Huey says: "Yeah, it sure was."
Huey says: "B."
Huey says: "O."
Huey says: "Y."
Huey says: "D."
Huey says: ", I don't think you're a killer robot."
Huey says: "You're just a kid."
B.O.Y.D. says: "That's the nicest thing anyone's said to me."
The wind blows a picture out of their journal. Huey makes a grab for it and accidentally falls off the tower.
Huey says: "Ah!"
Huey says: "AAAAHHH!"
B.O.Y.D. says: "Huey!"
B.O.Y.D. jumps down, reaches Huey, and converts his feet to thrusters.
Huey says: "AAAAHHHHH!!!!"
Huey says: "Huh?"
Huey says: "Ha ha!"
Akita says: "2."
Akita says: "B."
Akita says: "O."
Akita says: "is within range."
Akita says: "Up, bobobobobobo..."
Akita says: "Now, the moment of reckoning, shall be- Ahhh, has the sun gotten brighter in the last twenty years?"
Akita says: "Ugh, so stiff."
Huey says: "Ha ha ha ha."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Ha ha ha ha."
Tezuka says: "It's you."
Tezuka says: "Backup."
Tezuka says: "I need backup."
Fenton says: "Huey, step away from B."
Fenton says: "O."
Fenton says: "Y."
Fenton says: "D."
Fenton says: "You don't know what he's capable of."
Huey says: "Sure I do."
Huey says: "He just saved me with his rocket feet."
Gyro says: "And that is the problem."
Gyro says: "Its weapons systems are back online."
Gyro says: "We wait any longer, and the city is doomed."
Tezuka Gyro and Fenton start arguing with each other. B.O.Y.D. looks dejected.
Huey says: "Please stop trying to make B."
Huey says: "O."
Huey says: "Y."
Huey says: "D."
Huey says: "something he's not."
Huey says: "He didn't glitch once while we were having fun."
Huey says: "He was just being a kid."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Doctor Gearloose?"
B.O.Y.D. says: "Please."
B.O.Y.D. says: "I'm a definitely real boy."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Why can't you see that?"
Gyro says: "Because deep down, you're this."
Gyro says: "This is 2."
Gyro says: "B."
Gyro says: "O."
Gyro says: "'s core memory."
Gyro says: "Doctor Akita and I invented 2."
Gyro says: "B."
Gyro says: "O."
Gyro says: "to be the city's prime defense robot, but during the test run, 2."
Gyro says: "B."
Gyro says: "O."
Gyro says: "lost control, and attacked the city until Tezuka finally took it down."
Gyro says: "2."
Gyro says: "B."
Gyro says: "O."
Gyro says: "was the first invention I worked on that turned evil, and I have spent my whole life trying to live that down."
Gyro says: "2."
Gyro says: "B."
Gyro says: "O."
Gyro says: ", B."
Gyro says: "O."
Gyro says: "Y."
Gyro says: "D."
Gyro says: ", whatever, is dangerous down to its core."
B.O.Y.D. says: "But you said you could fix me, so I'd never malfunction again."
Gyro says: "Yes, by shutting you down for good."
Huey says: "B."
Huey says: "O."
Huey says: "Y."
Huey says: "D."
Huey says: ", run!"
Huey says: "Get out of here!"
B.O.Y.D. says: "Recall activated."
Gyro says: "Where is he going?"
Gyro says: "After him!"
Akita says: "2."
Akita says: "B."
Akita says: "O."
Akita says: ", because of you, I've become an outcast, and because of you, I will rise again."
Akita says: "Activate Revenge Protocol Omega."
Fenton says: "Blathering blatherskite!"
Gizmoduck says: "2."
Gizmoduck says: "B."
Gizmoduck says: "O."
Gizmoduck says: "!!!!"
Gizmoduck says: "You don't have to do what Akita tells you."
Gizmoduck says: "Do what I tell you."
Gizmoduck says: "Activate arm armor."
Gizmoduck says: "Aahh!"
Gizmoduck says: "Nothing can match the power of the keen human intellect commanding the gizmoduck armor."
Gizmoduck says: "Aaah!!"
Gizmoduck says: "Except the perfect computer brain commanding the gizmoduck armor."
Gyro says: "Intern!"
Gyro says: "Fight better!"
Akita says: "An intern with his own intern."
Akita says: "Hm hm hm, now I've seen it all."
Akita says: "My gratitude for returning 2."
Akita says: "B."
Akita says: "O."
Akita says: "to its true father."
Tezuka says: "Akita."
Akita says: "2."
Akita says: "B."
Akita says: "O."
Akita says: ", Vanquish the inspector."
Huey says: "Ah!!"
Tezuka says: "No, not again."
Gyro says: "No, not again."
Gyro says: "Save Gizmoduck."
Gyro says: "I've got to destroy 2."
Gyro says: "B."
Gyro says: "O."
Gyro says: "for good."
Huey says: "You can't!"
Huey says: "This is not who B."
Huey says: "O."
Huey says: "Y."
Huey says: "D."
Huey says: "is."
Huey says: "He's a, a definitely real boy!"
Gyro says: "It's just made to look that way."
Gyro says: "You saw its first memories."
Gyro says: "At 2."
Gyro says: "B."
Gyro says: "O."
Gyro says: "'s core, it's a weapon."
Huey says: "Wait, there's more there, hidden under all those old memories."
Gyro says: "Za ba ba ba ba?"
Gyro says: "All systems online."
Gyro says: "Welcome to the world, 2."
Gyro says: "B."
Gyro says: "O.."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Am I a real boy?"
Gyro says: "Hmm, definitely."
Akita says: "No, he's not."
Akita says: "This is a defense drone."
Gyro says: "Isn't he more than that?"
Akita says: "No!"
Akita says: "Now, go prep the monitors for the field test."
Akita says: "2."
Akita says: "B."
Akita says: "O."
Akita says: ", you are a rare breed."
Akita says: "The ultimate weapon."
Akita says: "Override all of Gyro's real boy programming, and execute Protocol World Breaker."
Gyro says: "That was his core until Akita overwrote my work."
Gyro says: "2."
Gyro says: "B."
Gyro says: "O."
Gyro says: "never had a choice."
Gyro says: "You forced him to be a weapon."
Akita says: "Oh intern, 2."
Akita says: "B."
Akita says: "O."
Akita says: "is and always will be a weapon for destruction, for power, for evil."
Gyro says: "Not all my inventions are evil!"
Gyro says: "Some are just wildly misunderstood!"
While Gyro and Doctor Akita have a slap fight, Gizmoduck is fighting B.O.Y.D. in the air. Several missiles are fired which B.O.Y.D. dodges handily. Both Gearloose and Akita get their glasses knocked off. B.O.Y.D. ends up overpowering Gizmoduck to be tazed by Inspector Tezuka. Akita finds his glasses first and pins Gyro.
Akita says: "Face it, intern."
Akita says: "You'll never invent anything worthwhile."
Akita says: "Ugh, no!"
Akita says: "Ugh."
Lil' Bulb punches Akita and he falls into a recycling bin only to be arrested by Tezuka.
Gyro says: "2."
Gyro says: "B."
Gyro says: "O."
Gyro says: "?"
Gyro says: "You are not evil!"
Gyro says: "You are good!"
Gyro says: "You're more than your programming."
Gyro says: "You are a definitely..."
Gyro says: "real..."
Gyro says: "boy."
Huey, Fenton and Tezuka watch in shock, beleiving it's going to give scientist finishing blow. Gyro kneels and suddenly he tearfully hugs his robotic son. B.O.Y.D. opens his eyes and smiles, having a blue pupils.
Gizmoduck says: "Yes!"
Huey says: "Yes!"
Gizmoduck says: "Woo hoo!"
Huey says: "Woo hoo!"
Gizmoduck says: "Ha ha!"
Huey says: "Ha ha!"
Gyro and B.O.Y.D. land. Huey runs towards his friend and embraces him.
Huey says: "You did it!"
Huey says: "You chose your programming."
Huey says: "Now, all you need is your own real name."
B.O.Y.D. says: "How about B."
B.O.Y.D. says: "O."
B.O.Y.D. says: "Y."
B.O.Y.D. says: "D."
B.O.Y.D. says: "?"
B.O.Y.D. says: "Be only yourself, dude?"
Gyro says: "Yes, intern."
Gyro says: "I was once like you."
Gyro says: "Of course, I was a naive idiot back then, but if I had someone to actually listen to me, I might not have been so hopeless, so you're hired full time, Doctor Crackshell-Cabrara."
Fenton says: "That's not technically how doctorates work, and I don't care."
Gyro says: "Okay, everybody."
Gyro says: "The hugging is a just-for-today thing."
B.O.Y.D. says: "So what should we do next?"
Huey says: "There's at least twelve shrines we haven't documented."
Tezuka says: "Leave now."
The four leave Tokyolk, Gyro riding on Gizmoduck's back while Huey rides B.O.Y.D.'s.
Huey says: "Woo hoo!"
B.O.Y.D. says: "Yeah!"
