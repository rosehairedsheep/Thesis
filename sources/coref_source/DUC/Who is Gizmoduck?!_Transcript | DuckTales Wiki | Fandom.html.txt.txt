Big Time says: "What the?"
Gizmoduck says: "Woah!"
Gizmoduck says: "Oof, that's mine, sorry, that's mine."
Gizmoduck says: "Everyone stay down i'm wearing an unstable nuclear acceleratron, so we may have a tiny situation here."
Big Time says: "Stay back, robo-nerd, or the normal nerd gets it."
Gizmoduck says: "Oh, well then, um, engage combat mode."
Bouncer says: "He's out of control!"
Suit says: "Hey, it looks like your processor core is overloading."
Suit says: "Would you like to vent excess energy?"
Gizmoduck says: "Yes, do that thing."
Gizmoduck says: "That sounds helpful."
Suit says: "Great."
Suit says: "Initiating self detonation."
Gizmoduck says: "What?"
Gizmoduck says: "No, stop, reboot, cancel."
Suit says: "Okay, canceling and extracade."
Gizmoduck says: "I guess this is happening now."
Gizmoduck says: "Bye!"
Huey says: "Wow!"
Bank manager says: "Ah, the money's on fire."
Bank manager says: "Oh the money's on fire!"

opening theme says: "You were there, young man."
opening theme says: "Could you see the pure evil in his cold, robotic eyes?"
Huey says: "What?"
Huey says: "He was wearing a visor."
Roxanne Featherly says: "I see."
Roxanne Featherly says: "So what's he trying to hide?"
Huey says: "No!"
Huey says: "He saved me."
Huey says: "He was smart and noble and made of metal, everything I always wanted to be, almost."
Huey says: "Where did he come from?"
Huey says: "Will I see him again?"

Officer Cabrera says: "For free."
Fenton says: "Yes, it is an unpaid internship, but believe me."
Fenton says: "Big things are happening."
Officer Cabrera says: "Claro pollito, I do believe in you, but this is getting a little harder is all."
Officer Cabrera says: "You want to do so much."

intercom says: "Um, Mr beaks, you've been cooped up in your office for days, sir."
intercom says: "Do you still want your 7:15 takeout pad thai?"
Mark Beaks says: "No, I want "him," and the spring rolls."
Mark Beaks says: "Bring me the spring rolls."
Gizmoduck says: "Dr."
Gizmoduck says: "Gearloose, would you think we could do more than just these reflex tests?"
Gyro says: "Are you asking for a lunch break?"
Gizmoduck says: "I'm saying look at all the amazing things this suit can do."
Gizmoduck says: "Uh, ah, ah, uwuh, oh, oh, sorry."
Gizmoduck says: "Where do these things keep coming from?"
Gyro says: "Are you crazy?"
Gyro says: "The core processor is still unstable."
Gyro says: "It can't handle multiple actions."
Gyro says: "Mr."
Gyro says: "McDuck said he'd cut my funding if another quote "cockamamie invention" goes haywire."
Gyro says: "Wait!"
Gyro says: "is this a dent?"
Gizmoduck says: "Did you say lunch?"
Gizmoduck says: "I heard lunch."
Gizmoduck says: "That's lunch everybody."
At one of Glomgold's construction sites says: "Gizmoduck: If I can figure out how the suit works, then I can show them what Fenton Crackshell-Cabrera can do."
At one of Glomgold's construction sites says: "Hah, first tool: ballpoint pointer."
At one of Glomgold's construction sites says: "This will be easy."
Gyro says: "Don't you start with me today."
Huey says: "Dr."
Huey says: "Gearloose?"
Gyro says: "Some kid."
Huey says: "As a Junior Woodchuck robotics badge candidate, I was able to trace the wheel tread of the bank robbery to one of your patents."
Gyro says: "Uh wait bababababa bah!"
Gyro says: "What bank robbery?"
Huey says: "The armored avenger who stopped the bank robbery?"
Huey says: "You created a superhero for Duckberg, didn't you?"
Gyro says: "I did what?"
Gyro says: "Agh, that subhuman, interning piece of AAHH!"
Gyro says: "I'll show him not to meddle with my darlings."
Gizmoduck says: "Extendo arms."
Gizmoduck says: "C'mon retract, retract!"
Gizmoduck says: "Ah, arm retraction is buggy."
Gizmoduck says: "Elbow grease."
Gizmoduck says: "uh, whaw!"
Gizmoduck says: "Rhubarb, meringue, boston creme."
Gizmoduck says: "Ha ha, finger gun lasers!"
Gyro says: "Hm, he's somewhere close by, but where?"
Gizmoduck says: "Flexo extendo abs!"
Gyro says: "Oh my gosh, it's him!"
Huey says: "Oh my gosh, it's him!"
Gizmoduck says: "Oh, uh, hi, Dr."
Gizmoduck says: "Gearloose."
Gyro says: "Get down here this instant!"
Gyro says: "The extendo abs are for putting boxes on high shelves, not for whatever it is you're doing!"
Huey says: "Hey, remember me?"
Huey says: "Huey."
Huey says: "from the bank?"
Huey says: "You saved me."
Huey says: "I cherished it."
Huey says: "I have some questions about your gear, possibly some upgrades."
Gyro says: "You're going to overload the core processor, and kill us all."
Gizmoduck says: "Oh, I say that's overkill."
Suit says: "Initiating overkill."
Gizmoduck says: "Woah!"
Gizmoduck says: "Oh sure, that couldn't be a pie?"
Huey says: "So what O."
Huey says: "S."
Huey says: "are you running?"
Huey says: "Is there a core processor?"
Huey says: "Or are all processes running through you?"
Gizmoduck says: "Interesting hypothesis."
Gizmoduck says: "An organic processor could- Focus!"
Huey says: "We'll catch up later!"
Gizmoduck says: "C'mon, c'mon!"
Gizmoduck tries to warn Mark Beaks, but he can't hear him.
Beaks says: "Hey, buddy."
Gizmoduck says: "Let's go!"
Gizmoduck carries Beaks from the helicopter before it explodes.
Gizmoduck says: "Are you hurt?"
Gizmoduck says: "You appear to be crying."
Beaks says: "Just..."
Beaks says: "some wind in my eyes."
Beaks says: "Wonderful, wonderful wind."
Gizmoduck says: "Huh?"
Beaks says: "Yay!"
Gizmoduck says: "Mr."
Gizmoduck says: "Beaks, I am so sorry."
Beaks says: "Sorry?"
Beaks says: "You saved me."
Beaks says: "Pfft."
Beaks says: "C'mon, I have an island where I blow up helicopters for fun."
Beaks says: "It happens."
Beaks says: "Anyway, I am your biggest fan."
Beaks says: "Been looking everywhere for you."
Gizmoduck says: "You..."
Gizmoduck says: "remember me?"
Beaks says: "Totally awesome robot duck that can't help but stand out?"
Beaks says: "That's quality Beaks bait."
Beaks says: "Tell me, what is your deal?"
Beaks says: "have a ton of untapped potential?"
Beaks says: "I completely agree."
Beaks says: "With my help, you can help all of Duckberg."
Gizmoduck says: "Help all Duckburg?"
Beaks says: "That's right."
Beaks says: "and I have the money, resources and positive buzz you need."
Beaks says: "See, right now, you're a bad meme."
Beaks says: "I want to make you a good meme."
Beaks says: "Breakdancing toddler, turtle eats a pancake, you feel me?"
Gizmoduck says: "Uh, not really."
Beaks says: "Listen, I can give you access to the Waddle phone network."
Beaks says: "Imagine responding to calls from across the city."
Beaks says: "A hero for everyone."
Beaks says: "You can see it, can you?"
Beaks says: "Join us at team Waddle."
Beaks says: "Your destiny awaits."
Beaks says: "Woah..."
Gizmoduck says: "I already have a propeller, and a boss who gave me this suit."
Gizmoduck says: "Thanks, but I got to fly."
Beaks says: "Seed planted."
Beaks says: "You will me mine."
Beaks says: "Hey, I'm stuck on the roof."
Beaks says: "Going to need you to send up another helicopter."
Beaks says: "Stairs?!"
Beaks says: "!"
Gyro says: "You're fired."
Fenton says: "Dr."
Fenton says: "Gearloose?"
Fenton says: "What happened?"
Gyro says: "Ah-ah, If Mr."
Gyro says: "McDuck finds out about this, I'm finished!"
Gyro says: "I'm scrapping the project."
Fenton says: "I saved a man from an exploding helicopter."
Gyro says: "Which you exploded!"
Gyro says: "Next armor, I'm losing all the gizmos."
Fenton says: "But then, it's not Gizmoduck."
Gyro says: "There is no Gizmoduck."
Gyro says: "You are an intern, and you're not even that anymore."
Gyro says: "Go away."
Gyro says: "Manny, incinerate the armor."
Gyro says: "We don't need it falling into the wrong hands."
Fenton says: "Blathering blatherskite!"
Huey says: "Mr."
Huey says: "Gizmoduck, I've been going over your suit's design, and you could be doing so much more."
Gizmoduck says: "Yep yep, I agree."
Gizmoduck says: "Off to save Duckberg."
Mark Beak's office says: "Gizmoduck: Mr."
Mark Beak's office says: "Beaks, I accept your offer."
Beaks says: "New guy, you're back, what a crazy, random surprise."
Beaks says: "Welcome to Waddle, the only company capable of saving our fair Duckberg."
Beaks says: "Let me introduce you to Waddleduck!"
Beaks says: ""Waddleduck, you're my hero."
Beaks says: "" Commemorative selfie."
Officer Cabrara says: "Pollito, my son working at Waddle."
Officer Cabrara says: "Finally a real job."
Officer Cabrara says: "I've never been more proud in my life."
Fenton says: "Um, uh, gracias, Mama."
Gizmoduck says: "Gizmodu- ah I mean, Waddleduck reporting for duty, sir."
Beaks says: "Reporting to me?"
Beaks says: "No, no no no, you report to them, the Waddle consumer."
Beaks says: "Thanks to our brand new hero-on-demand app, we're going to be huge."
Beaks says: "When Waddlers are in need, You'll get a ring-a-ding, then you'll zip-zing right over to do your thing."
Gizmoduck says: "Okay, but what if people without the app need help?"
Gizmoduck says: "What about bigger crimes?"
Beaks says: "Ha ha, oh you glorious fool."
Beaks says: "Nothing is bigger than the needs of Waddle customers."
Beaks says: "But if you do refuse a call, your system will be overridden."
Gizmoduck says: "What?"
Beaks says: "You wanted to help people, right?"
Beaks says: "Get to it hero."
Beaks says: "Ha hah."
Gizmoduck says: "Well, relationships are built on communication."
Louie says: "The remote?"
Louie says: "Yeah, that Pep can?"
Louie says: "And a grape?"
Louie says: "No, no, two grapes."
Louie says: "You know what, make it three."
Gizmoduck says: "You."
Gizmoduck says: "What do you need?"
Huey says: "I need you to toss that in the trash."
Gizmoduck says: ""My faith in you."
Gizmoduck says: "" I don't understand."
Huey says: "Waddleduck?"
Huey says: "Really."
Huey says: "You're not a hero; you're a sellout."
Huey says: "So go ahead."
Huey says: "Throw away my faith in you."
Huey says: "In the recycling, you monster."
Bro-y dude says: "Easy, I just got this puppy detailed."
Gizmoduck says: "Ah, so stupid."
Bro-y dude says: "I'm gonna need room to pull out here."
Bro-y dude says: "Just a few more inches up front?"
Duck Mom says: "Aah!"
Gizmoduck says: "Huh?"
Gizmoduck says: "Pardon me, duty calls."
Gizmoduck says: "You need to download the app, sign up, use a password, verify account, check spam-dozer."
Big Time says: "Not so tough, this time, eh microwave?"
Gizmoduck says: "Hgrrr!"
Beaks says: "W."
Beaks says: "D."
Beaks says: "what's the word, man?"
Beaks says: "I'm seeing a lot of bad reviews on the app."
Gizmoduck says: "I need control."
Gizmoduck says: "A person plummeting to their untimely death doesn't have time to open an app."
Beaks says: "Oh, it's possible."
Beaks says: "The waddle phone is super fast."
Gizmoduck says: "I quit!"
Beaks says: "Oh cool, It's just, thing is you belong to me, so don't be ungrateful."
Beaks says: "I made you the most buzz-worthy guy in town."
Beaks says: "Come to think of it, I can't have you being more popular than me."
Beaks says: "In fact..."
Fenton says: "No, wait, what are you?"
Fenton says: "No!"
Beaks says: "Sorry, you don't deserve the armor, chico."
Beaks says: "Behold, Waddleduck 2."
Beaks says: "0."
Beaks says: "Guards!"
Fenton says: "But you don't know how it works."
Fenton says: "Activating too many gizmos will overload the core processor."
Beaks says: "Meh, I got it."
Huey says: "Hey hey."
Huey says: "Ho ho."
Huey says: "Wadddleduck has got to go."
Huey says: "Hey hey."
Huey says: "Ho ho."
Huey says: "Wadddleduck has got to go."
Fenton says: "Listen to me, Beaks has no idea what's he's doing."
Fenton says: "He'll kill us all."
Officer Cabrara says: "Pollito?"
Beaks says: "Welcome to Waddle."
Beaks says: "I am Waddleduck, or should I say, Mark Beaks."
Beaks says: "Your favorite billionaire is now your favorite superhero, y'all!"
Huey says: "Boo!"
Huey says: "No way, you're not a hero!"
Beaks says: "Say what, now?"
Huey says: "I mean, how could you be him?"
Huey says: "You were rescued by Gizmoduck."
Huey says: "And you really think we wouldn't notice your whole faces are different?"
Roxanne Featherly says: "So you'll be responding personally to all help requests?"
Beaks says: "Eh, for the sake of efficiency, I'm placing my self in charge of who gets saved and who doesn't, for I am Waddleduck."
Fenton says: "Beaks, stop."
Fenton says: "Somebody stop him."
Beaks says: "Pew Pew pew pewpewpewpew pew pew."
Beaks says: "Heh hah!"
Beaks says: "Huh."
Suit says: "Bulbie here."
Suit says: "Looks like there is a core overload."
Beaks says: "Get it off of me!"
Beaks says: "Get it off of me!"
Suit says: "Would you like to vent excess energy with self detonation?"
Beaks says: "Yes, yes, yes, whatever."
Suit says: "Great, initiating self detonation."
Beaks says: "What?"
Beaks says: "Oh oh oh no!"
Fenton says: "Cancel the order."
Fenton says: "It will explode."
Beaks says: "To panicked to process."
Beaks says: "Save me, amigo."
Fenton says: "I am not your amigo."
Fenton says: "I'm not a mascot, or an intern, or a fancy tool."
Fenton says: "Blathering blatherskite!"
Gizmoduck says: "I am Gizmoduck!"
Huey says: "Ha hah!"
Huey says: "Faith restored!"
Suit says: "Heads up."
Suit says: "Venting excess energy with processor core detonation."
Huey says: "Just rip out the processor core."
Gizmoduck says: "I can't."
Gizmoduck says: "It will explode."
Gizmoduck says: "I need the suit to get rid of the processor, but the suit won't run without the processor."
Huey says: "You don't need it."
Gizmoduck says: "Where am I going to find a complex system that can handle many things at once?"
Huey says: "Right here."
Huey says: "Your brain is the perfect processor."
Huey says: "It's like I've been trying to tell you."
Huey says: "You can do more."
Gizmoduck says: "You're right."
Gizmoduck says: "You've been right."
Gizmoduck says: "Ow, ouch, that's my brain."
Huey says: "Aahh!"
Huey says: "The suit is not Gizmoduck."
Huey says: "You are."
Huey says: "That's a robotics badge and a philosophy badge right there."
Gizmoduck says: "It's all me."
Gizmoduck says: "I'm in control."
Suit says: "Core meltdown in 10..."
Suit says: "9..."
Suit says: "8..."
Gizmoduck says: "Oh no, I'm in control!"
Gizmoduck says: "Scatter!"
Gizmoduck says: "This thing is gonna blow!"
Suit says: "Goodbye!"
Huey says: "Tonight, we watched someone make the ultimate sacrifice for the city."
Huey says: "Despite the fact that we doubted him, he was our hero."
Roxanne Featherly says: "Hey!"
Roxanne Featherly says: "That- Get away from my camera!"
The camera pans to Fenton, he survived miraculously and is badly injured. Fenton groans weakly before passing out. Later, he awakens in hospital in full body cast as his mother is seen.
Fenton says: "Ugh, uhh..."
Fenton says: "Mama?"
Officer Cabrara says: "Pollito!"
Fenton says: "I think I was fired."
Fenton says: "I was definitely fired."
Officer Cabrara says: "Just rest right now."
Officer Cabrara says: "Someone's sprung for the VIP hospital suite."
Scrooge says: "Need a word with you."
Fenton says: "Mr."
Fenton says: "McDuck?"
Officer Cabrara says: "Scrooge McDuck?"
Officer Cabrara says: "Ooh, I'll leave you two alone."
Officer Cabrara says: "See if you can get money out of him."
Officer Cabrara says: "He's loaded."
Fenton says: "Heh heh."
Scrooge says: "You know, I spend a lot of time abroad."
Scrooge says: "I won't always be here for Duckburg."
Scrooge says: "I need someone to make sure this place is still standing when I get back."
Scrooge says: "Gyro?"
Gyro says: "Mr."
Gyro says: "McDuck was very impressed by "my" hero armor."
Gyro says: "And he feels that despite literally every physical piece of evidence to the contrary, you are the right person to test the new model."
Gyro says: "The armor is self-contained using your brain as the core processor."
Gyro says: "Go ahead."
Fenton says: "Blathering blatherskite?"
Fenton says: "Ha ha ha, ouch, ow, ow."
Fenton says: "I think I need a new cast."
Scrooge says: "Looking good, lad."
Scrooge says: "You work for me now."
Scrooge says: "I just need a name to write on the paychecks."
Gizmoduck says: "Call me Gizmoduck!"
Gizmoduck says: "No no no no aaahh!!"
