Huey says: "Now here's the amazing part."
Huey says: "The vascular cambium displays three distinct growth rings the exact same distance apart."
Huey says: "Factoring out drop deformities, this tree Scrooge found experienced three leap years in a row!"
Dewey says: "You dragged me out of the bath for this?"
Dewey says: "What are you doing now?"
Huey says: "Tasting for resin samples."
Huey says: "They can- OW splinter."
Dewey says: "I said, don't interrupt me unless something "exciting" happens."
Huey says: "What's more exciting than dendrochronology?"
Dewey says: "Ghouls, goblins, time paradoxes, daring quests that will cement our names in history, you get the idea."
Tin can on a desk says: "Brring, Brring, Brrring."
Tin can on a desk says: "Answer me please."
Tin can on a desk says: "Brrring."
Scrooge says: "What are you kids doing mucking about in my office?"
Dewey says: "More importantly, your can is ringing."
Scrooge says: "Tatter me tartan."
Scrooge says: "Do not answer that."
Scrooge says: "Ugh, that can is your cousin Fethry calling from a top-secret deep sea laboratory."
Dewey says: "Top-secret?"
Huey says: "Deep sea laboratory?"
Scrooge says: "Don't get too excited."
Donald says: "Is coo coo bananas."
Scrooge says: "Best to ignore it."
Scrooge says: "All to see a barnacle formation in the shape of a tractor or some such nonsense."
Donald says: "Big waste of time."
Fethry says: "Brrring, brrring, adventure calling."
Fethry says: "I've made a bolder discovery."
Huey says: "Aahhh!"
Dewey says: "Aahhh!"
Huey says: "Best time waste ever!"
Dewey says: "Best time waste ever!"
Huey says: "Wait, did we just steal a sub?"
opening theme says: "Huey: The treacherous high seas."
opening theme says: "The abyss."
opening theme says: "The big blue."
Launchpad says: "I call it the underwater sky."
Huey says: "The Mid-atlantic Ridge is the longest ocean mountain range in the world."
Dewey says: "Forbidden beasts of the deep."
Huey says: "And our very own cousin is the scientist exploring it all."
Dewey says: "Perhaps we'll discover a bold new species they'll name after me."
Dewey says: ""Deweybiggus Magnificus."
Dewey says: "" No, no, no, wait."
Dewey says: ""The Great Blue Dewfin."
Launchpad says: "Mmmm.."
Dewey says: "Meh, more thinking it."
Dewey says: "How about "The Dewfish?"
Huey says: "There's already a dewfish."
Huey says: "commonly known as the fresh water catfish."
Dewey says: "Ew, gross, no."
Dewey says: "Gotta fix that and give the name to something cooler."
Scrooge says: "Launchpad?!"
Scrooge says: "!"
Dewey says: "Oops, look it's broken."
Dewey says: "Look at that."
Dewey says: "Radio came right up."
Dewey says: "Hubert, write that down."
Dewey says: "Good thing Uncle Scrooge asked us to do this totally non suspicious trip to test the equipment."
Launchpad says: "You bet."
Launchpad says: "Could you imagine if that had happened when we were in actual danger?"
Launchpad says: "Anyway, do you want me to pull up next to the rusty haunted lighthouse, or..."
Launchpad says: "what you want me do?"
Dewey says: "Good start to an adventure."
Dewey says: "I'm liking this."
Fethry says: "Hey, up here."
Fethry says: "It's me, from the can."
Fethry says: "Come on up."
Huey says: "Alright, let's go meet a genius."
Female voice says: "Launchpad."
Female voice says: "Oh Launchpad."
Launchpad says: "Oceanika?"
Launchpad says: "Is that you, my love?"
Huey says: "Cousin Fethry?"
Dewey says: "What the."
Fethry says: "WARNING!"
Fethry says: "Never drink sea water!"
Fethry says: "Tempting as it is, it'll just make you thirstier."
Fethry says: "Hurray little Donalds, you are here."
Huey says: "Were you performing some kind of experiment on the effect of gravity on sponges?"
Fethry says: "Well I was just decompressing from all the deep sea pressure on the uh..."
Fethry says: "what's that thing that does all the thinking..."
Fethry says: "BRAIN!"
Fethry says: "I'm Fethry."
Fethry says: "Your Uncle Donald's favorite cousin."
Huey says: "Yeah, he sends his love."
Dewey says: "So why the decoy?"
Fethry says: "Decoy?"
Fethry says: "Oh Arturo!"
Fethry says: "He's just here to scare pirates."
Dewey says: "Do you get pirates here a lot?"
Fethry says: "Never."
Fethry says: "He's that good."
Dewey says: "Huh."
Fethry says: "We haven't had an outsider in the lab in years."
Fethry says: "Great to see you."
Fethry says: "I like your hat."
Dewey says: "So, did you have a big discovery to show us?"
Dewey says: "Perhaps something big and awesome in need of a big awesome name."
Fethry says: "You want to see something?"
Fethry says: "I mean really see something?"
Huey says: "Uh, yes?"
Fethry says: "Then follow me, eager minds, to liquid space, the silent habitat."
Fethry says: "Dive!"
Fethry says: "Dive!"
Fethry says: "Presenting man's niftiest invention: the Aquavator."
Fethry says: "Ahoy explorers."
Fethry says: "As we descend, we ask that you keep your hands and arms inside the vehicle."
Fethry says: "No flash photography, and watch your children, please."
Dewey says: "Uh, we are children."
Fethry says: "Oh, well ignore everything I just said."
Fethry says: "Let us be the first to welcome you to the McDuck sub-lab of the future."
Fethry says: "The sub-lab of the future was actually built in the past, nineteen sixty-four."
Fethry says: "The goal: to explore the unexplored."
Fethry says: "We have the Tully Observatory where we do all our sciency projects and what have you."
Fethry says: "Five star cafeteria, Indoor jai alai court, Outdoor jai alai court, heh less popular, and my little addition: the Dream room."
Fethry says: "Great for naps, relaxation, embracing the unending darkness, becoming one with the abyss."
Fethry says: "You're in for a real treat, little Donalds."
Fethry says: "Set your minds to wonder."
Dewey says: "Wow, this guy kind of sounds like you."
Huey says: "Genius?"
Huey says: "Visionary?"
Huey says: "In charge of a massive research facility?"
Dewey says: "Weird."
Dewey says: "You're both really into weird stuff."
Dewey says: "Oh, you found one of your own."
Fethry says: "Behold."
Fethry says: "The world's best-kept secret: the ocean."
Dewey says: "Ah!"
Huey says: "Ah!"
Dewey says: "It's horrible!"
Huey says: "It's horrible!"
Huey says: "It's actually pretty majestic  up from an evolutionary standpoint."
Dewey says: "I was hoping to see more of an apex predator."
Dewey says: "A real Dewey, you know?"
Fethry says: "Well, there's plenty of ocean, so take it all in."
Fethry says: "Become one with it."
Huey says: "What?"
Huey says: "Cousin Fethry is doing what great minds do."
Huey says: "Lose yourself to science."
Huey says: "He's a classic eccentric genius."
Huey says: "Eccentric genius is the top rung of scientists."
Huey says: "AAHH!"
Dewey says: "AAHH!"
Dewey says: "What was that?"
Huey says: "It must be the hydrothermal vents."
Dewey says: "Of course, yes."
Fethry says: "Volcanic ruptures that blow toxic minerals into the ocean's lowest depths."
Fethry says: "You do not want to be around them."
Fethry says: "The hydrothermal vents are mucking up the water."
Fethry says: "We'll need the help of my team."
Huey says: "See?"
Huey says: "His team?"
Huey says: "A weirdo couldn't run a team of scientists."
Fethry says: "Puh-puh-puh-puh-pit stop!"
Dewey says: "AAHH!"
Huey says: "AAHH!"
Fethry says: "Got it."
Fethry says: "Ah, the Tully Observatory."
Fethry says: "Go ahead, the team's waiting."
Fethry says: "Woah!"
Dewey says: "Ah!"
Huey says: "Dewey?"
Huey says: "Nothing to be afraid of, here."
Huey says: "Just wonders of the deep."
Huey says: "Nothing- to- AAHH!"
Dewey says: "Yep."
Huey says: "What are these?"
Fethry says: "Giant sea worms mutated from the toxic vents."
Fethry says: "They just want to squeeze the warmth out of you."
Dewey says: "You mean kill us?"
Fethry says: "Well, I don't- Yeah, that would work."
Fethry says: "But they can sense fear."
Fethry says: "Just be friendly, affectionate, convince them you're not a threat."
Fethry says: "Observe."
Fethry says: "You are a good gentle soul, and I am honored to be in your wormy presence."
Fethry says: "Oh ho ho ho, who's a good worm?"
Fethry says: "Come on, little Donalds."
Dewey says: "You're leaving us?"
Dewey says: "No get off."
Dewey says: "If you kill me, I will not name you after me."
Huey says: "Agh, oh, you are a slime polychaete, I love you?"
Huey says: "Ahh!"
Huey says: "It worked."
Huey says: "Cousin Fethry was right."
Huey says: "Dewey, just compliment it."
Dewey says: "Uh, you're not the most disgusting thing I've ever seen?"
Dewey says: "Augh!"
Huey says: "Dewey!"
Huey says: "I love how you catch only the best phytoplankton."
Huey says: "Um, your blood finds carbon monoxide much better than our hemoglobin."
Huey says: "Ahh, I'm too panicked to be sincere."
Huey says: "Bleh!"
Dewey says: "Ha ha, you kissed him, the worm, so gross."
Fethry says: "Donalds?"
Fethry says: "I'd like you to meet our distinguished team."
Huey says: "Oohh!"
Fethry says: "Team, meet Little Donalds One and Two."
Fethry says: "Boys, meet Charles, Sylvia, Cameron, Phillipe, Fish-breath, Simone, Virgil, Beverly, Nicholas, Alastair, Benji, Doctor Krill, and of course the ever feisty Hans."
Huey says: "Uh."
Dewey says: "That's the team?"
Fethry says: "Uh huh."
Fethry says: "Their natural bio-luminescence can light our way if need be."
Fethry says: "It guarantees we always have a light source as we go deeper."
Huey says: "See, not weird."
Dewey says: "He's singing to them."
Huey says: "Am I right that this is the Benthopelagic zone we are approaching?"
Fethry says: "Down here we call it the deep, deep, total, absolute, very, very, bottom zone."
Fethry says: "It's easier to remember."
Dewey says: "Wow, like a mirror into your future."
Huey says: "Come on, I mean sure, we're both clearly brilliant, but we're not that similar."
Dewey says: "Okay, okay."
Dewey says: "You both have the nerd-out gene."
Dewey says: "You're both obsessed with nerd stuff."
Dewey says: "You both wear red caps that you never take off."
Huey says: "The Junior Woodchuck Guidebook states that a warm head breeds warm, healthy thoughts?"
Fethry says: "The Junior Woodchuck Guidebook states that a warm head breeds warm, healthy thoughts?"
Fethry says: "Ah, always good to see a fellow chucker."
Huey says: "I'm not that into the Junior Woodchucks, more of a part-time hobby."
Fethry says: "End of the line."
Fethry says: "No, literally."
Fethry says: "Something's cut the cable to the bottom observatory."
Huey says: "What did that?"
Fethry says: "This whole lab is falling apart."
Fethry says: "Ooh, I warned Uncle Scrooge about the upkeep."
Dewey says: "So we don't get to find the totally awesome new species and name it "Dewfish II: Dewey's Revenge?"
Fethry says: "Oh I can still show you the findings in my airtight pod, but we'll have to swim."
Fethry says: "Draw!"
Huey says: "We're going out there?"
Fethry says: "Oh, watch out for the vents."
Huey says: "Ah!"
Fethry says: "Alright team, flank out."
Fethry says: "Mariners, our journey continues."
Dewey says: "This water is warm."
Dewey says: "Oh, Huey!"
Huey says: "Hey!"
Huey says: "That's not me."
Huey says: "It's the hydrothermal vents."
Fethry says: "Welcome."
Fethry says: "I'm still harmonizing the furniture to the room."
Fethry says: "Finding that positive circulation."
Fethry says: "Working on the sub-aquatic Feng shui."
Huey says: "You live here?"
Fethry says: "Oh just for the last four and a half years."
Fethry says: "Anyway, the moment you've been waiting for."
Dewey says: "Ugh, it's about time."
Fethry says: "A true biological wonder."
Fethry says: "You are pioneers."
Fethry says: "The first to see this unbelievable creature."
Fethry says: "You must be hungry."
Fethry says: "Can I make you a sandwich?"
Fethry says: "Hot soup?"
Dewey says: "Just show us the thing!"
Fethry says: "Oh yes yes yes, over here."
Fethry says: "Now, just look out there."
Fethry says: "And, ta-dah!"
Huey says: "Is it behind the krill?"
Fethry says: "It is the krill."
Fethry says: "They're all rainbow-y."
Fethry says: "I've never seen anything like it."
Dewey says: "Krill?"
Dewey says: "We stole the sub for krill?"
Dewey says: "We almost die for krill?!"
Dewey says: "!"
Huey says: "There is an explanation for why we needed to see this, right?"
Huey says: "Some scientific breakthrough?"
Fethry says: "I don't know."
Fethry says: "I just thought it looked pretty."
Fethry says: "Oh, you thought I was a scientist?"
Huey says: "You're not even a scientist?"
Fethry says: "No, I'm the lab's caretaker."
Fethry says: "Scrooge stationed me for upkeep, and a little light cleaning."
Fethry says: "You see, this pod is kind of like my broom closet."
Fethry says: "I guess you could say I'm well versed in the custodial sciences."
Fethry says: "Ha ha."
Huey says: "We trusted you!"
Huey says: "Came all the way down here!"
Huey says: "We got attacked by a squid!"
Huey says: "I kissed a worm!"
Huey says: "This was all a waste of time."
Dewey says: "Okay, alright Cuz, this has been fun, hope we never meet again."
Dewey says: "Now we need to get back to dry land."
Dewey says: "So can we  get to it?"
Dewey says: "Huh?"
Dewey says: "Hello?"
Fethry says: "Oh you're not going anywhere."
Fethry says: "cause that monster's going to eat us!"
Huey says: "Aahh!"
Dewey says: "Now "that" is a Dewey!"
Fethry says: "We have to get out of here!"
Fethry says: "Follow the key!"
Huey says: "Ahh!"
Huey says: "Ahh!"
Huey says: "Aah!"
ALL says: "AAHH!"
ALL says: "Ugh!"
Dewey says: "What is that monster?"
Dewey says: "And does it have a name because wow?!"
Dewey says: "!"
Huey says: "It must have torn up the lab, and now it's coming for us!"
Huey says: "So, you lured us down here to get devoured by a monster!"
Huey says: "Thanks!"
Fethry says: "Oh, you're welcome."
Fethry says: "I- what?"
Fethry says: "No."
Huey says: "Maybe we can get a better look at it."
Huey says: "We're back on."
Dewey says: "Okay okay okay, I'm going to try to blind this, this "Dreaded Dewsaurus of the Deep?"
Dewey says: "" uh no, we'll find a name if it kills me."
Huey says: "It probably will."
Fethry says: "Huh?"
Fethry says: "Mitzi?"
Huey says: "What?"
Huey says: "What are you talking about?"
Fethry says: "I know her."
Fethry says: "She used to be on my team."
Fethry says: "Look at you Mitz, you've gotten so big."
Fethry says: "It's me, Fethry Duck."
Fethry says: "Remember, we split a rib-eye that one time."
Fethry says: "It was a bit dry."
Fethry says: "What are you doing?"
Fethry says: "Stop it!"
Dewey says: "You stop it."
Dewey says: "I'm trying to save us from that monster you unleashed."
Fethry says: "She's not a monster, she's a Mitzi."
Fethry says: "Just because she's a little different doesn't make her bad!"
Huey says: "Wait, is she?"
Dewey says: "Huey, help, between the toxic jets and the monster attack, we're never going to make it up in time."
Fethry says: "Leave Mitzi alone."
Fethry says: "She's trying to help!"
Fethry says: "Junior Woodchuck Rule 2: All Junior Woodchucks must be open to the unknown in their quest for the truth."
Huey says: "Blue krill, blue krill, in the deep dark sea."
Dewey says: "Welp, Huey's gone sea mad."
Dewey says: "we're dead."
Huey says: "She was a member of Fethry's team."
Huey says: "Hm, the chemicals in the vents must have mutated the krill and turned it into that."
Huey says: "Ha ha!"
Fethry says: "Look, she's trying to communicate."
Huey says: "Stop blinding her!"
Dewey says: "What?"
Huey says: "Maybe she didn't tear up the lab."
Huey says: "Maybe the hydrothermal vents did."
Dewey says: "You're both nuts."
Huey says: "No, just weird, and this guy knows his krill."
Dewey turns off the light and Mitzi, the giant krill brings them to the surface.
Huey says: "We're alive!"
Dewey says: "Fethry?"
Dewey says: "Where did he go?"
Fethry says: "Mitzi, you rascal."
Fethry says: "This is like the fourth coolest thing you've ever done."
Huey says: "She saved him."
Huey says: "She saved all of us!"
Dewey says: "The Dewnificent Krilldebeast."
Dewey says: "Write that down in your book."
Dewey says: "Did you get it?"
Dewey says: "Hear what I said?"
Huey says: "Um, sure."
Dewey says: "No, come on, write it, it's science now."
Fethry says: "Thank you boys."
Huey says: "What will you do now that the lab is gone?"
Fethry says: "Well, you thought I could be a scientist."
Fethry says: "Then maybe I should become one for real."
Fethry says: "So, do I have to fill out a form for that?"
Fethry says: "Or do I just buy a lab coat?"
Fethry says: "You know what?"
Fethry says: "I'll figure it out."
Fethry says: "Cause that's what scientists do."
Fethry says: "Farewell."
Fethry says: "Giddy-up Mitzi!"
Huey says: "He is so incredibly weird."
Dewey says: "And there's nothing wrong with that, Little Fethry."
Launchpad says: "Uh, farewell, sweet Oceanika."
Launchpad says: "Whenever I put a conch shell to my ear, I won't hear the ocean."
Dewey says: "Uh, Launchpad."
Dewey says: "What happened to you?"
Launchpad says: "Oh, just ran into an old friend."
Launchpad says: "Snorkeled around, saw some..."
Launchpad says: "sea stuff."
Launchpad says: "You?"
Dewey says: "That."
Fethry says: "Woo!"
Fethry says: "Ha ha ha ha."
Fethry says: "Woo!"
Launchpad says: "Ah, neat!"
Huey says: "Come on intrepid explorers."
Huey says: "Let's go home and convince Uncle Scrooge this was Louie's idea."
