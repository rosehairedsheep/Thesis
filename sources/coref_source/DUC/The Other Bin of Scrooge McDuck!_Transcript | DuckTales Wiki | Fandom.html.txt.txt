Lena says: "Will you stop?"
Lena says: "That's really annoying."
Magica says: "You're really annoying."
Magica says: "I give you one simple task."
Lena says: "Simple?"
Lena says: "How in the heck is this simple?"
Magica says: "All you have to do is pose as the pink one's friend."
Magica says: "Gain her trust."
Lena says: "and cut loose Scrooge's number one dime without him waking up while you yell at me the whole time."
Scrooge says: "um, ah."
Magica says: "I'm not yelling, I'm whispering harshly!"
Magica says: "You want your freedom, you do as I order."
Lena says: "I'm not your puppet."
Lena says: "You really want to hurt Scrooge, be my guest."
Magica says: "I would love to, but, , I miss carnage."
Magica says: "Quickly, the eclipse is coming."
Magica says: "with it my power grows but it's still hard without the dime."
Lena says: "Would you just quiet down."
Lena says: "We don't want to get caught."
Webby says: "Lena, what are you doing?"
Lena says: "Uhhhh..."
opening theme says: "Lena: Ehhh..."
Scrooge says: "Get your filthy chimney hands off my hard earned mountain."
Scrooge says: "Yah!"
Webby says: "What were you doing in Scrooge's room?"
Lena says: "What were you doing there?"
Webby says: "Oh nothing."
Webby says: "Definitely not collecting drool samples while he sleeps."
Lena says: "No, you think it's silly."
Webby says: "What?"
Lena says: "Well, it's just Mr."
Lena says: "McDuck's pretty cool, I may have caught a bit of the obsession bug from you."
Webby says: "Oh no, sorry you caught THE GREATEST DISEASE EVER!"
Webby says: "Oh oh, let's start a fan club, oh, the fan club should start a blood oath."
Webby says: "Oh let's take a blood oath!"
Lena says: "Or..."
Lena says: "we can start by checking out Scrooge's number one dime."
Webby says: "Huh, I wish."
Webby says: "He keeps it to himself, that selfishly lovable genius, but I do have an exhaustively researched presentation on the life and times of Scrooge McDuck!"
Lena says: "Oh no."
Webby says: "Scotland 1867: A duckling is hatched to humble beginnings."
Lena says: "Ugh."
Magica says: "Ugh."
Louie says: "And..."
Louie says: "time!"
Dewey says: "Ulp, hah!"
Dewey says: "Did I do it?"
Dewey says: "Did I break the world record for doing slash folding laundry?"
Louie says: "According to this very real almanac, you..."
Louie says: "missed the record by two seconds."
Dewey says: "Oh man, I'm never going to get a world record in anything."
Louie says: "Hey, winning the world record in literally anything is your dream."
Louie says: "And I will always be there to support that dream."
Louie says: "With piles of dirty clothes."
Louie says: "What?"
Huey says: "Do you realize how mad Dewey will be when he finds out you've been taken advantage of him?"
Louie says: "Do you realize Dewey ruined my favorite hoodie in the wash?"
Louie says: "So who's the real victim here?"
Huey says: "Hey!"
Huey says: "No problem, how about I darn it, and rewash it for you?"
Huey says: "Okay, bye."
Webby says: "Until Scrooge realized his worst nightmare was being caused by a mythical dream catcher he found January 8th, 1977."
Webby says: "On January 9th, 1977..."
Scrooge says: "I'm telling you, something is off in the mansion."
Beakley says: "Mr."
Beakley says: "McDuck, I assure you."
Beakley says: "Nothing strange is going on here."
Scrooge says: "Then how do you explain this?"
Scrooge says: "My Number One Dime has been tampered with."
Beakley says: "But the filament is made from uncuttable enchanted quadriamond."
Scrooge says: "Would have to be supernatural."
Scrooge says: "There's something afoot in this house, and I'm going to find out what."
Scrooge says: "Until I get to the bottom of this, I'm putting the dime in the Other Bin for safe keeping."
Webby says: "Making Scrooge McDuck the finest adventure capitalist the world will ever see."
Webby says: "Now onto the slide show."
Webby says: "I'm going to get the projector."
Lena says: "Ugh..."
Magica says: "Well, you messed up."
Lena says: "I literally haven't moved."
Magica says: "You didn't move fast enough before, and now our arch-nemesis is on to us."
Magica says: "Scrooge went and hid the dime in something called The Other Bin."
Magica says: "This is all your fault."
Lena says: "Okay, you're mad."
Lena says: "But at least the dime isn't on him anymore."
Lena says: "We just gotta find this mysterious other bin thingy."
Lena says: "You're welcome."
Magica says: "You just had to waste your time with lecture girl instead of sticking to the plan."
Lena says: "Using her was part of the plan."
Magica says: "THEN USE HER ALREADY!"
Webby says: "Okay, most of these are an artist rendering of the facts, but I drew them, so they're amazing."
Lena says: "Cool."
Lena says: "Uh real quick, What's the other bin?"
Lena says: "Good, you've heard of it."
Lena says: "Let's go."
Webby says: "Oh no no no no."
Webby says: "The Money Bin is where the money goes."
Webby says: "The Other Bin is for the other things, the bad things where Scrooge puts all most dangerous finds and artifacts to keep them away from prying hands."
Webby says: "Why would you want to go there?"
Lena says: "Cause I just heard Scrooge say he put his number one dime in there."
Webby says: "Ah, he almost never takes off the dime."
Lena says: "Then we better go check it out before he takes it back."
Webby says: "Oh, I don't know."
Lena says: "You're telling me there's a mystical room in your own home that you never been to that contains Scrooge's greatest secrets and you DON'T want to go there?!"
Lena says: "!"
Webby says: "Uh.."
Webby says: "Ah, okay, fine."
Webby says: "To adventure!"
Huey says: "What?"
Huey says: "no, I didn't do anything."
Huey says: "Nothing is going on."
Louie says: "So..."
Louie says: "this isn't your Big-Foot."
Dewey says: "Whaaaaaa what?"
Huey says: "I can explain."
Huey says: "I was in the woods bird watching."
Huey says: "Little did I know, something was watching me."
Huey says: ""Easy fellow."
Huey says: "Seems like your heart is a tender as your feet."
Huey says: "I shall call you Tender-feet."
Huey says: "" What started as an anthropological find, became a friendship for the ages!"
Louie says: "Hey!"
Louie says: "He's stretching out my hoodie!"
Huey says: "Look what you did."
Huey says: "He's so sensitive."
Dewey says: "You are family now."
Louie says: "Oh, come on."
Huey says: "We gotta keep him a secret."
Huey says: "Uncle Scrooge is on the hunt."
Louie says: "Which is why we should hand him over."
Louie says: "The last thing I need is Scrooge snooping around and finding any number of my devious, yet delightful schemes."
Huey says: "You mean all those schemes we know about?"
Dewey says: "Sure would be a shame if Uncle Donald found out about that "charity" he's been donating to for the past three years."
Louie says: "Hey!"
Louie says: "Louie's Kids takes Uncle Donald's donations for children in need."
Louie says: "Children like me."
Louie says: "Children exactly like me."
Louie says: "It's for me."
Tender-feet says: "Uh..."
Huey says: "I promise I'll fix your hoodie."
Louie says: "Fine, I'll do it."
Louie says: "For the CHILDREN."
Scrooge says: "The dime is secure, now the hunt is on."
Webby says: "Based on Duckworth's old cleaning schedule, the entrance to the other bin is somewhere in here."
Webby says: "Don't worry, it's just some assorted zombie parts."
Lena says: "Scrooge sure seems to be good at hunting monsters."
Webby says: "He's never met a mystical foe he couldn't defeat."
Webby says: "Right, zombie hand?"
Lena says: "Well, that's comforting."
Webby says: "According to this, to find the bin, we must see through Scrooge's eyes and get into his head."
Lena says: "Looks like someone already got to his head."
Webby says: "Through his eyes."
Webby says: "I see a painting."
Lena says: "This must be it, but how do we get into his head?"
Webby says: "What's he looking at?"
Lena says: "Hey, Lemme see that."
Webby says: "Wow, for a forbidden danger chamber, this has been pretty easy."
Webby says: "We should find the dime in no time."
Lena says: "You were saying?"
Webby says: "Maybe we should do some more research before we're, you know, lost in here forever?"
Lena says: "So it's a little bigger than we thought."
Lena says: "It's still worth it to find the dime."
Webby says: "Uh fine, but we need to take some time to figure out which door to open."
Lena says: "Why is Scrooge hiding a frilly unicorn?"
Webby says: "Sword horse."
Webby says: "Aahh!"
Lena says: "Aahh!"
Louie says: "I need something to calm my nerves."
Louie says: "Where's my Pep Select?"
Louie says: "Hey, what are you doing?"
Huey says: "Tender-feet, there you are."
Huey says: "How do you keep getting out, buddy?"
Louie says: "Quit eating and drinking the best snacks."
Louie says: "That's my thing."
Louie says: "What, you, c'mon, hey!"
Dewey says: "Not cool, Louie."
Huey says: "Relax, Louie."
Huey says: "Tender-feet doesn't know any better."
Huey says: "He's just a lovable, simple-minded beast."
Louie says: "Simple-minded?"
Louie says: "He's making a sandwich on a panini press."
Tenderfeet says: "Huh?"
Tenderfeet says: "Heh-heh-heh."
Huey says: "We gotta get him out of here before Scrooge sees him."
Dewey says: "Here boy, delicious baloney."
Tender-feet says: "Nuh-uh."
Louie says: "Ugh, how about some fancy cheese?"
Scrooge says: "Hm, still warm."
Scrooge says: "Dill pickles and salted ham."
Scrooge says: "An excellent pairing of flavors."
Scrooge says: "Clever girl."
Webby says: "Yah, Woah!"
Webby says: "This is so dangerous."
Webby says: "Wee!"
Magica says: "Someone's wearing her crazy pants, today."
Magica says: "C'mon, let's ditch her and find the dime."
Lena says: "We can't."
Magica says: "Ooh."
Magica says: "If I didn't know any better, I say you value your little sidekick over your own freedom."
Lena says: "Oh, Believe me, I would do anything to get you off my back, but without Webby, I could be lost forever."
Lena says: "Oh no, Webby, catch."
Webby says: "Huh, Yah!"
Webby says: "Okay, that was intense."
Webby says: "We should go back, develop a system, figure out where to look safely."
Lena says: "A system?"
Lena says: "That could take months."
Lena says: "We gotta find the dime now before Scrooge decides to take it back."
Webby says: "Why?"
Webby says: "What's the hurry?"
Webby says: "Follow up question, where did you get a diamond dagger from anyway?"
Lena says: "Oh hey look, mysteries."
Webby says: "Six, four, five, six,  or six, four, fifty-six."
Lena says: "Yes, um hum, numbers."
Webby says: "They're dates."
Webby says: "June 4th 1956."
Webby says: "The day Scrooge captured the sword horse."
Webby says: "And if you recall from today's lecture, the date Scrooge earned his number one dime was."
Webby says: "1877!"
Webby says: "Come on!"
Huey says: "Tender-feet, here Tender-feet."
Louie says: "How do you keep losing a giant monster?"
Huey says: "Just because we like him better than you doesn't mean you have to hate him."
Louie says: "Wait, what?!"
Louie says: "!"
Louie says: "I am your brother!"
Louie says: "You met this thing like a day ago!"
Dewey says: "Well he never tricked me into doing his laundry."
Dewey says: "Yeah, I know about that."
Huey says: "We gotta split up to find him."
Tender-feet says: "Woo hoo hoo."
Tender-feet says: "Dudes, I'm telling you."
Tender-feet says: "This mansion is sick."
Tender-feet says: "Check it."
Bro 2.
Bro, there's so much mahogany.
Tender-feet says: "Right?"
Tender-feet says: "this con is killer."
Tender-feet says: "I'm all like "rar rar rar," and these dummies let me do whatever I want!"
Bro 3.
Dude, you're the man, Gavin!
Tenderfeet says: "Ah yeah, guess who has two opposable thumbs and is inviting you all over for a massive party?"
Tenderfeet says: "Uh, this guy!"
Bro 2 and 3.
Woo hoo, party's on.
Tender-feet says: "Yeah yeah yeah, anyway I'll group text you the deets, Gavin out!"
Louie says: "Gavin out, indeed."
Tenderfeet says: "Huh?"
Tenderfeet says: "Oh, I mean, ruh???"
Louie says: "Can't out-con a con, "bro"."
Louie says: "Oh, Uncle Scrooge!"
Tenderfeet says: "So, you figured out the Big-Foot in your house is scamming you."
Tenderfeet says: "Problem is, the Big-Foot in your house is scamming you."
Tenderfeet says: "And yeah bro, he lifts."
Tenderfeet says: "Heh-heh-heh."
Scrooge says: "What?"
Scrooge says: "did you see something, lad?"
Louie says: "Um, well, oh, oh my, uhhhh, no."
Scrooge says: "Eh, wasting my time."
Scrooge says: "And pick up that trash!"
Huey says: "Tender-feet..."
Tenderfeet says: "Huh, hhrrhh."
Dewey says: "Aw, was mean old Louie mean again?"
Tenderfeet says: "Uh huh."
Dewey says: "Oh, It's okay boy."
Louie says: "Oh bigfoot, you just poked the bear."
Webby says: "Here we go."
Webby says: "1877, Scrooge's number one dime."
Magica says: "This is it."
Webby says: "Hey Lena, I think you locked me out, accidentally."
Magica says: "yes, the time is at hand."
Magica says: "Closer fool, closer."
Magica says: "What are you waiting for?"
Magica says: "An invitation?"
Magica says: "Take the dime!"
Magica says: "Yes!"
Lena says: "Uh, Ahh, AAhh!"
Magica says: "Finally, the power!"
Magica says: "That felt good."
Magica says: "With the dime in my hands, nothing can stand in my way."
Magica says: "Wait, you deserve a hug."
Webby says: "Diamond dagger cuts through anything."
Webby says: "Wait, what's going on?"
Webby says: "Is that?"
Magica says: "Yep."
Magica says: "A harbinger of your doom."
Webby says: "Oh no, the dime!"
Webby says: "Give it back!"
Webby says: "Lena, run!"
Magica says: "Why?"
Magica says: "She's been working for me."
Webby says: "Scrooge!"
Lena says: "Webby!"
Lena says: "No!"
Magica says: "She keeps barging in."
Magica says: "We gotta put a bell on her or something."
Lena says: "What are you doing?"
Magica says: "Exactly what you've been doing the whole time."
Magica says: "Using her, pulling her strings."
Magica says: "Here, allow me to demonstrate with delightful irony."
Magica impersonating Webby says: "Scrooge this."
Magica impersonating Webby says: "Scrooge that."
Magica impersonating Webby says: "Pink stuff."
Magica impersonating Webby says: "Hi, I'm Webster."
Magica says: "Or whatever."
Lena says: "Her name is Webby."
Magica says: "Who cares?"
Magica says: "I mean, you don't."
Magica says: "You were just using her, right?"
Magica says: "Like a tool."
Magica says: "What's the matter?"
Magica says: "Do you miss your friend the slide ruler?"
Magica impersonating Webby says: "Good one, Magica."
Magica says: "Thanks, dummy."
Magica says: "Ha!"
Magica says: "Little prop humor for you there."
Magica says: "Good time, now give me the dime."
Lena says: "I'm not doing anything until you turn Webby back."
Magica says: "I'm sorry, I must have misheard you."
Magica says: "Are you telling your master what to do?"
Magica says: "Because that doesn't sound like someone who wants her freedom, does it, Wendy?"
Magica says: "Let's try this again."
Magica says: "Give- me- the dime!"
Lena says: "No!"
Lena says: "I'm not your puppet anymore."
Magica says: "Is that so?"
Magica says: "Luckily, I have a spare!"
Magica impersonating Webby says: "You're not my friend."
Magica impersonating Webby says: "You're a coward!"
Magica impersonating Webby says: "A traitor!"

Magica impersonating Webby says: "AAHH!!"
Magica says: "Whoops!"
Magica says: "She gone."
Lena says: "Nooo!!!"
Webby says: "Lena, wake up you snoring angel."
Lena says: "Webby?"
Webby says: "There is no dime."
Webby says: "There never was."
Webby says: "The dream catcher from the lecture."
Webby says: "It sucked you into..."
Lena says: "..."
Lena says: "my worst nightmare."
Webby says: "Aw, you were listening."
Webby says: "I got the code wrong."
Webby says: "This one is one eight, seventy-seven, we need eighteen seventy-seven."
Webby says: "C'mon."
Lena says: "No, I'm done."
Lena says: "Let's get out of here before anything else bad happens."

Louie says: "He's losing his hair."
Louie says: "Without the majestic power of the woods, Tenderfeet is dying."
Dewey says: "Stupid majestic woods."
Louie says: "We must take him back where he belongs before it's too late."
Tenderfeet says: "hrrr hrr hrrh rrhr hrr."
Scrooge says: "Ah ha!"
Scrooge says: "A bigfoot."
Scrooge says: "I knew there was something strange afoot."
Huey says: "No please don't!"
Huey says: "He's our friend."
Dewey says: "His name is Tenderfeet, but his soul is tender too."
Louie says: "We brought him out of the woods into the mansion and right into our hearts."
Louie says: "We thought we were saving him, but in a way, he was saving us."
Louie says: "You know what that's like, right?"
Louie says: "Maybe Tenderfeet is someone's nephew, and he must return home to his own uncle."
Scrooge says: "Ulp, oh go ahead."
Huey says: "When we first met, it was a thorn in your paw."
Huey says: "But now?"
Dewey says: "It's in here."
Louie says: "Now go back from wince you came."

Webby says: "You know, this was fun, but I'm kind of glad we stopped."
Webby says: "I was a little nervous about the whole thing."
Lena says: "I know, and I'm sorry I forced you to do something you didn't want to do."
Scrooge says: "What the blazes are you two doing in here?"
Webby says: "Oh, of course!"
Webby says: "The number one dime was in the number one chamber."
Webby says: "Duh!"
Scrooge says: "No one thinks to check the first one."
Scrooge says: "But you shouldn't be checking at all."
Scrooge says: "The other bin is far too dangerous."
Lena says: "It's on me."
Lena says: "We wanted to see your dime, and we overheard you were keeping it in here, and: Webby: Sorry, Uncle Scrooge."
Scrooge says: "You should know by now, that if you want to know something all you had to do was ask."
Scrooge says: "Be straight with me, lassie."
Scrooge says: "What if you were lost, or hurt, or eaten by the dragon?"
Webby says: "Aw man, there's a dragon in here?"
Magica says: "Blah!"
Magica says: "now, listen to your aunt and grab the dime, grab the dime, grab the dime."
