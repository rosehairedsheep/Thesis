Dewey says: "Oh man, that is classic cinema."
Webby says: "So good."
Lena says: "Oh, and remember when the surgeon tried to cut the mole-woman in half, and she multiplied into a million mole-babies and ate him?"
Lena says: "Roar!"
Webby says: "Roar!"
Lena says: "Ahh!"
Beakley says: "You said this was an educational film, suitable for all ages."
Lena says: "Uh, it's a cautionary tale about the dangers of mole monsters, and everyone could use a lesson on chainsaw safety."
Louie says: "Lame, where was the drama, the heart, the needlessly expensive car crash mayhem?"
Huey says: "Even if mole-man did exist, why attack someone in the shower?"
Huey says: "With the water running there wouldn't be enough traction to attack anyone above the knee."
Huey says: "Totally phony."
Webby says: "What is with you guys?"
Webby says: "It says right on the poster, "based on an actual true novel."
Huey says: "This is the only book I trust."
Huey says: "If it's not in the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook, then it's not a thing."
Webby says: "What about were-ducks?"
Huey says: "Nope."
Webby says: "Trifoxes?"
Huey says: "Not a thing?"
Webby says: "Woah, what about the legendary Terra-firmians of Duckberg?"
Huey says: "Let's see, pterodactyl, terror-dactyl, terrible twos, nope no terra-firmians."
Huey says: "Must not exist."
Webby says: "Haha, what?"
Webby says: "Terra-firmians, the mythical underground race that live below our very city?"
Huey says: "No, that's ridiculous."
Webby says: "No, you're ridiculous."
Lena says: "Children, children, there's an easy way to settle this."
Lena says: "Let's go find them ourselves."
Beakley says: "Ahem: Launchpad: AHHH!"
Beakley says: "Evil."
Beakley says: "Evil."
Beakley says: "You took the form of a poster, you won't get Launchpad."
Dewey says: "Stop, Launchpad, no."
Beakley says: "It's just an ad."
Launchpad says: "That's exactly what the sheriff told those reckless teens."
opening theme says: "Huey: Wait, shouldn't we tell someone where we're going before we blindly explore a network of dark and abandoned subway tunnels?"
Huey says: "we're heading down."
Webby says: "We'll be fine."
Lena says: "Don't wait up."
Huey says: "All, much better."
Beakley says: "I apologize for my associate."
Beakley says: "You can bill McDuck Enterprises for the poster."
Manager says: "Oh, what about the damages to the men's room?"
Beakley says: "The men's room?"
Launchpad says: "They come up through the toilets."
Launchpad says: "Anyone can be a mole monster."
Launchpad says: "Anyone."
Launchpad says: "could be him, her, that baby, even.."
Launchpad says: "him."
Beakley says: "Alright, let's go before anything else happens."
Beakley says: "Wait, where are Huey and Webby and  Lena?"
Webby says: "Uhgh: Lena: Huh, now what's behind here?"
Webby says: "The old 818 train line, famous for terra-firmian sightings."
Webby says: "That's why it's closed off."
Huey says: "The signs say "closed for renovations."
Webby says: "That's what they "want" you think."
Huey says: "Who are "they"?"
Webby says: "Exactly."
Huey says: "What?"
Lena says: "Well we can't "not" go in at this point."
Lena says: "Hello?!"
Lena says: "!"
Huey says: "Huh huh, these old tunnels."
Huey says: "You can hear train vibrations from miles away."
Webby says: "That was no subway train."
Webby opens her book.
Webby says: "The terra-firmians are an ancient race of two warring tribes."
Webby says: "The terrans and the firmies."
Webby says: "They were once united under a proud king."
Webby says: "After the king's untimely death, an epic battle began over who would assume control."
Webby says: "But, one day, the rightful prince will reunite the two tribes and put an end to their bitter conflict."
Huey says: "What's that?"
Webby says: "Oh, just a drawing of a candy I wish they made: webbi-dings."
Lena says: "And that?"
Webby says: "Me as a superhero."
Webby says: "Look, could we just focus on the exciting stuff I just said?"
Lena says: "So these terra-thingies are responsible for that tremor?"
Huey says: "According to the JWG, earthquakes are shifting tectonic plates."
Huey says: "Science fact."
Huey says: "No reason for any of us to go in there."
Huey says: "The book knows everything."
Lena grabs the guidebook and throws it down the stairs.
Lena says: "Did the book know I was going to do that?"
Webby says: "Ha ha, I can't wait to meet a real terra-firmian."
Webby says: "I'm totally going to sacrifice myself in the name of the rebellion."
Lena says: "Oh, and then I hunt down your attackers and avenge your death."
Webby says: "Aw, that's sweet."
Webby says: "There!"
Webby says: "Claw marks."
Webby says: "Proof they were here."
Huey says: "Even better!"
Huey says: "The tremors exposed three kinds of rock: schist, marble, and gneiss."
Huey says: "Oh, do I spy some shale?"
Lena says: "How is that better than subway monsters?"
Huey says: "Cause my thing's real."
Webby says: "How can you dismiss this after all the stuff we've seen with Mr."
Webby says: "McDuck?"
Huey says: "Most of that is actually logged in the Guidebook."
Webby says: "Even the headless man-horse?"
Huey says: "It's been booked."
Huey says: "Anything new, I add myself."
Huey says: "Now help me with this shale rock."
Huey says: "It's for my geology badge."
Webby says: "Why don't you ask your best friend, the Guidebook, to help you?"
Webby says: "Wait, you can't; it's a book."
Huey says: ""How to properly handle rock samples in the field."
Huey says: "" Ahem."
Huey says: "What was that?"
Huey says: "Um, after you."
Webby says: "Terra-firmians!"
Lena says: "Sorry, couldn't resist."
Huey says: "Just more subway junk."
Huey says: "Now, if you're all done, I have some rock samples to collect."
All says: "AAHHH!"
Oh hey! Watch it!
Huey says: "Louie?"
Webby says: "Granny?"
Launchpad says: "AHH Those are moles!"
Dewey says: "Launchpad, it's just the guys."
Launchpad says: "Huh, you would say that."
Launchpad says: "Have there always been three of them?"
Webby says: "Haha, I can explain."
Beakley says: "You are all in big trouble."
Beakley says: "I assume this was your idea."
Lena says: "Sure, blame the mysterious rebel playing by her own rules."
Beakley says: "No backtalk."
Beakley says: "You made me come all the way down here, drag two more children and one man..."
Beakley says: "child right into danger."
Launchpad says: "MAN-CHILD?!"
Launchpad says: "!"
Launchpad says: "WHERE!"
Launchpad says: "?"
Launchpad says: "Woah, easy LP easy, one monster at a time."
Lena says: "Aren't you supposed to be crazy adventure family?"
Lena says: "This is like an afternoon field trip for you people."
Beakley says: "Well, there won't be any more afternoon field trips for you, I can assure you that."
Webby says: "Granny, Lena didn't mean to..."
Webby says: "Terra-firmeans!"
Huey says: "Naturally occurring tectonic shifts!"
Beakley says: "Oh, splendid, we're stuck."
Beakley says: "It looks like the only safe way out of here is to get this train moving."
Beakley says: "Launchpad, get to the control room."
Launchpad says: "No, Mrs."
Launchpad says: "B."
Launchpad says: "I can't leave you alone with.."
Launchpad says: "I mean, uh, I don't know if I can."
Launchpad says: "I've never crashed a train before."
Beakley says: "Well, maybe you can drive the train without crashing it."
Launchpad says: "Huh?"
Beakley says: "Uh, just get to the control room and see what you can do?"
Launchpad says: "Fine."
Launchpad says: "Hey Dewey, come with me."
Launchpad says: "I need someone to help..."
Launchpad says: "me..."
Launchpad says: "for some reason."
Launchpad says: "Just in case."
Beakley says: "I'm going to the rear to see if I can detach us from the cave in."
Beakley says: "You , with me."
Beakley says: "You caused us enough grief."
Lena says: "Aye, Aye."
Lena says: "Colonel Crumpet."
Webby says: "We'll stay here and be on the lookout for terra-firmians."
Webby says: "It must be about halftime at the quake games, it should be easier to spot one."
Beakley says: "Okay, just stay put."
Beakley says: "After you help us get out of here, you'll never see Webby again."
Lena says: "Okay Lady, you are real bad at asking for help."
Huey says: "Please talk some sense to Webby."
Huey says: "You don't really believe that rock monsters are playing earthquake games."
Louie says: "Huey's usually right about nerd stuff."
Webby says: "Not this time."
Webby says: "Those aftershocks are actually a revolt led by the lost terra-firmian prince."
Webby says: "He's using the games as a distraction to storm the Calafirmy Citadel."
Webby says: "It's all in this artist rendering."
Louie says: "Ooh, that all sounds awesome, I want that to be true."
Huey says: "Earthquakes are a result of shifting tectonic plates."
Webby says: "But who's pushing the plates, Huey?"
Webby says: "Who's pushing the plates?"
Huey says: "Other plates are pushing the plates."
Webby says: "Now who sounds ridiculous?"
Huey says: "Louie, who's side are you on?"
Louie says: "Oh, neither."
Louie says: "This is just way more entertaining than that movie."
Louie says: "What?"
Louie says: "I got a refill on the way out."
Louie says: "It's encouraged."
Huey says: "Probably just some leftover rubble from the cave in."
Webby says: "I'm coming your highness!"
Huey says: "Webby, no, please it's not safe."
Webby says: "Uh, this could be it, this could be the prince."
Webby says: "This could be..."
Webby says: "a rock?"
Huey says: "Uh, see, just a bolder from the cave in."
Huey says: "Can we go back inside before we're crushed?"
Webby says: "No."
Webby says: "just because this is only a rock, doesn't mean there aren't terra-firmians still out there."
Huey says: "So we're supposed to examine every rock in this tunnel?"
Huey says: "That actually sounds pretty fun."
Huey says: "Wait, that's not the point."
Lena says: "Looking good, Tea-time."
Lena says: "Keep it up."
Beakley says: "This would go a lot faster if you'd give me a hand."
Lena says: "Well, the sooner I help you, the sooner I never get to see my friends again, so..."
Lena says: "Want me to go get one of the more trustworthy kids to help, or am I still not allowed to talk to them?"
Beakley says: "Do not mouth off to me."
Beakley says: "It's your fault we're in this mess."
Beakley says: "Who raised you, anyway?"
Beakley says: "I know a bad influence when I see one."
Beakley says: "Those are good children with bright futures."
Lena says: "Yeah?"
Lena says: "And what does that make me?"
Beakley says: "I don't know."
Lena says: "If you're going to vandalize, at least do it right."
Launchpad says: "So, Dew, it's nice down here, huh?"
Launchpad says: "Kinda natural for you."
Launchpad says: "You know what I like?"
Launchpad says: "Dirt."
Launchpad says: "Dirt's pretty cool and comfy huh?"
Launchpad says: "No grass seed without dirt."
Dewey says: "I guess."
Launchpad says: "But I hate the sun."
Launchpad says: "Not into that."
Launchpad says: "Gets into your beady little eyes, makes everything all hot, plus it makes it a lot harder to possess people."
Launchpad says: "No thanks, am I right?"
Dewey says: "Launchpad, do you think I'm a mole monster?"
Launchpad says: "What?"
Launchpad says: "No, no."
Launchpad says: "I can't believe my best friend is a mole monster."
Dewey says: "I'm your best friend?"
Launchpad says: "Oh no, it can hear my thoughts."
Launchpad says: "Keep it together, Launchpad."
Launchpad says: "Gotta change the subject, somehow."
Launchpad says: "Hey, you know what we should talk about?"
Launchpad says: "Another subject."
Dewey says: "Sure."
Launchpad says: "He doesn't suspect a thing."
Huey says: "Okay, look out the window."
Huey says: "this is not real."
Huey says: "You have a very active imagination, Webby, I want to encourage it."
Huey says: "I admire your vivid imagination..."
Webby says: "You're not even listening to me."
Webby says: "You want to listen to me?"
Webby says: "I'm saying one thing, you are ridiculous, "I know everything, I am scientific, me and my science facts."
Huey says: "..."
Huey says: "but this is a rock, not a terra-something, a stupid rock..."
Huey says: "that suddenly disappeared."
Louie says: "Ohh, nice twist."
Huey says: "Um, anything could have happened to that rock."
Huey says: "It could have rolled off."
Webby says: "Rolled off, up, and out of this dent?"
Webby says: "Hah, I don't think so."
Huey says: "Uh, maybe it disintegrated, or sudden wormhole, they're always good for an unexplained disappearance, or we could all be seeing things because of a methane gas leak."
Huey says: "Let me check the JWG."
Louie says: "Are we all seeing that?"
Huey says: "That?"
Huey says: "That's sparks from faulty wiring, or maybe a crazed sword killer with a flashlight."
Huey says: "Still not counting out methane gas leak."
Webby says: "Not everything is a methane gas leak."
Huey says: "It's gone."
Louie says: "Oh, that's way creepier."
Dewey says: "Ah, my eyes."
Launchpad says: "Ah, I knew it!"
Launchpad says: "Mole man!"
Launchpad says: "Everything I ever seen in a movie is real!"
Launchpad says: "AAAHHH!"
Launchpad says: "AAAHHHH!!!"
Dewey says: "Launchpad, let me in!"
Launchpad says: "Not on your life, mole man."
Beakey says: "I suppose you're good for something."
Lena says: "Ah, don't hurt yourself with a compliment, Abby Road."
Lena says: "I'm just trying to help."
Beakey says: "Alright, I've had it up to here with your horrid behavior."
Train turns on, Lena sees Magica in her shadow. Launchpad starts accelerator and train starts moving.
Beakey says: "C'mon."
All says: "Ahh!"
Huey says: "This can't be happening."
Webby says: "Down here!"
Launchpad says: "AAAHHH!!"
Terra-firmian says: "AAAHHH!!"
Launchpad says: "cough, cough, woo, crashed it."
Launchpad says: "Back foul monster you can't take me too, Mr McD won't give me the time off."
Dewey says: "Launchpad, it's me, Dewey."
Dewey says: "Your best friend?"
Launchpad says: "They could be anyone."
Launchpad says: "They are everywhere."
Dewey says: "Yes, anyone can be a mole monster, in the movie."
Dewey says: "This is real life."
Launchpad says: "Classic mole monster."
Launchpad says: "saying he's not a mole monster."
Dewey says: "By that logic, how do you know you're not a mole monster?"
Launchpad says: "Cause I'm not, which is exactly what a mole monster would say."
Launchpad says: "Wait, am I a mole monster?"
Launchpad says: "But I'm a good guy."
Launchpad says: "but that means, mole monsters can also be good guys."
Launchpad says: "Come mole brother, this is a new day for our people."
Launchpad says: "We will show the world that we can be good: Magica: Leave her, Lena."
Launchpad says: "She'll never trust you."
Launchpad says: "She's keeping you from them."
Launchpad says: "Leave her and we'll be better off."
Beakey says: "You."
Lena says: "Yeah, me."
Lena says: "Let's go."
Webby says: "Huey: Louie: Where are you?"
Webby says: "Huey, Huey, c'mon, we got to go!"
Huey says: "Can't."
Huey says: "need to stay near the light."
Huey says: "I can still see."
Huey says: "the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook says I'm statistically safer this way."
Louie says: "If you stay here, you'll be crushed."
Huey says: "At least I'll know what's crushing me."
Huey says: "Who knows what's out there?"
Webby says: "We know what's out there."
Webby says: "Terra-firmians."
Huey says: "But if they're real, then what other crazy things are out there just waiting for me in the dark?"
Webby says: "The only way to know is to find out together."
Louie says: "uh okay, I didn't see that coming."
Louie says: "Really came together in the third act."
Lena says: "Everyone here?"
Lena says: "Everyone okay?"
Launchpad says: "Oh yeah, we're A-ok."
Launchpad says: "Just a couple of non-monster folk eager to help out."
Huey says: "A way out?"
Huey says: "There's a way out?"
Webby says: "Huey, wait."
Webby says: "I told you they were real."
Huey says: "He must be the prince and the others are his rebel force."
Pink says: "They must have got trapped down here."
Red says: "This must be the prince of the bill-faced creatures of the land above and the others are his rebel force."
Pink says: "I told you they were real."
Beakey says: "Huey!"
Huey says: "Boop: Beakey: That was interesting."
Red says: "Boop: Beakey: That was interesting."
Huey says: "We still need to find a way out."
Red says: "We still need to find a way out."
Huey says: "Look."
Huey says: "they smashed us an exit."
Launchpad says: "Thank you fellow underground creatures."
Huey says: "Sorry I doubted you."
Webby says: "I'm proud of you, Huey."
Webby says: "Facing your fears, embracing the unknown."
Huey says: "Annd logged it!"
Huey says: "no longer unknown."
Huey says: "They exist, science fact."
Huey says: "Ah, that feels so much better."
Webby says: "Uhh."
Launchpad says: "I really could get used to being down here."
Launchpad says: "I love being a mole monster!"
Beakley says: "Launchpad, you are not a mole monster."
Launchpad says: "Oh, well aright."
Launchpad says: "makes sense."
Magica says: "why didn't you leave the big purple one?"
Magica says: "She's getting in the way of our plans."
Beakley says: "Lena, listen dear."
Beakley says: "I may have been a bit quick to judge you."
Beakley says: "Would you like to join us in the mansion for pancakes?"
Lena says: "Now when you say pancakes do you mean actual pancakes or english muffins covered in maple syrup?"
Beakley says: "I mean actual pancakes."
Lena says: "Then yes."
Beakey says: "Lena, you're welcome at the mansion any time."
Lena says: "That's why."
Lena says: "Gotta play the long game."
Lena says: "Hey, wait up!"
