Open Int. Steven's Room.
Steven is filming himself in his room, as he screams into the camera.
Steven says: "HOOOOO!!"
Steven says: "Guys!"
Steven says: "It's time for a new episode of "CRYING BREAKFAST FRIENDS!!"
Steven says: "" You guys, I'm so excited it's finally back."
Steven says: "I even stayed off the internet all day 'cause I didn't want to get..."
Steven says: "spoiled!"
Steven says: "*chuckles* Because they're food?"
Steven says: "I know I used that joke last week, but for real, this is supposed to be a big one."
Steven says: "Alright."
Steven says: "Play!"
Steven presses a "Play" button off-screen and "Crying Breakfast Friends!" begins to play on a small screen on the bottom left screen, as he sings along to the opening theme.
Steven says: "♪ Tears of sorrow, tears of joy."
Steven says: "♪ There'll be tears till the very end."
Steven says: "♪ Food with feelings, ♪ Crying Breakfast Friends!"
(The title of the episode is shown says: ""Party Crashers"."
(The title of the episode is shown says: "It opens with Pear, wearing a party hat and standing in the middle of an empty party."
(The title of the episode is shown says: ")"
Steven says: "Huh."
Steven says: "That looks fun."
Pear looks around and starts to cry.
Steven says: "Oh, Pear."
Spoon walks onto the scene with Fried Egg and Waffle.
Spoon says: "What's wrong, Pear?"
Steven says: "It's Spoon!"
Spoon says: "Why are you crying?"
Pear says: "Oh, Spoon."
Pear says: "I invited my friends over for a breakfast party."
Pear says: "*hyperventilates* But..."
Pear says: "nobody..."
Pear says: "came!"
Steven says: "Aww..."
Spoon says: "Oh, but- but that's why we're here."
Steven says: "Huh?"
Pear says: "Huh?"
Spoon, Fried Egg and Waffle are joined by Bacon Strips and Milk.
Spoon says: "We came for your party."
Spoon says: "I'm sorry we were late!"
Spoon says: "Please forgive us!"
Pear says: "*sprays tears* Aaahh, I forgive you!"
Spoon says: "Yay!"
Everyone begins to cry, including Steven.
Steven says: "Yes!"
Steven says: "Conflict resolved!"
Steven says: "Sweet catharsis!"
Steven says: "Huh, I didn't think I would be crying this early into the episode."
Suddenly, an ominous entity looms over the breakfast friends.
Spoon says: "Ah, what!"
Spoon says: "?"
Pear says: "Aaaeeeee!"
Steven says: "W-w-w-wha?"
Steven says: "What's that?"
The ominous entity is a refrigerator.
Steven says: "It's a fridge!"
Steven says: "?"
Steven says: "Is it more food?"
Steven says: "French toast?"
(The fridge opens says: "Burger, Sandwich, and Pizza."
three angry figures jump out says: "Burger, Sandwich, and Pizza."
(The fridge opens says: ")"
three angry figures jump out says: ")"
Steven says: "Oh my gosh."
Steven says: "Is this..."
Steven says: "Is this..."
Sandwich says: "Breakfast time is over."
Steven says: "I think I know what this is."
Burger says: "Clear the table!"
Pizza says: "Yeah."
Pizza says: "Get a box to go."
Sandwich says: "There's only room for one meal at a time, and that's us."
Burger says: "The "Angry Lunch Enemies"!"
Sandwich says: "The "Angry Lunch Enemies"!"
 says: "The "Angry Lunch Enemies"!"
Pizza says: "The "Angry Lunch Enemies"!"
Steven says: "It's lunch!"
Steven says: "I knew it!"
Steven says: "Theory confirmed!"
Pear keeps crying at the situation, until Burger approaches.
Burger says: "Stop crying!"
Steven says: "Hey!"
Spoon says: "Wait!"
Spoon says: "Maybe there can be two meals at the same time!"
Spoon says: "Wanna try it?"
Sandwich says: "*groans* Okay, but I'm angry about it."
Steven says: "What?"
Spoon says: "Fried Egg!"
Steven says: "No..."
Spoon says: "Avocado!"
Spoon says: "Bacon Strips!"
Steven says: "*excitedly* Yes!"
Steven says: "Please!"
Fried Egg, Avocado and Bacon Strips begin to place themselves in between Sandwich, becoming...
Steven says: "*gasps loudly* Brunch!"
Steven says: "They're brunch!"
Sandwich starts crying in joy, when the credits suddenly begin to roll.
Steven says: "Huh?"
Steven says: "It's over?"
Steven says: "Wow!"
Steven says: "I can't wait for the next episode, whenever that is, am I right?"
Steven says: "*winks* Okay, friends!"
Steven says: "See ya next time!"
