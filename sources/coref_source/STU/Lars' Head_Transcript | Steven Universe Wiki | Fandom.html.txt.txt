Open Int. Homeworld Kindergarten.
Following the events in "Off Colors", Steven and the Off-Colors observes in awe as the recently-resurrected Lars wakes up from his supposed-death.
Lars says: "*groans* What the heck just happened?"
Steven says: "*hugs Lars tightly* Lars!"
Steven says: "You saved us!"
Steven says: "You stopped the Robonoids, but- but one of them exploded, and- and you weren't moving, and I started crying."
Steven says: "*gasps in realization* I brought you back to life!"
Steven says: "It was an accident."
Steven says: "I mean, I probably would've done that on purpose if I had known I could do that, but I didn't really ask your permission, so I'm sorry."
Lars says: "*confused* Back to life?"
Lars says: "So I was..."
Lars says: "away from life?"
Lars says: "Aah!"
Lars says: "*looks at his body* I'm pink!"
Steven says: "Ah!"
Steven says: "I know!"
Steven says: "Do you feel okay?"
Lars says: "I don't..."
Lars says: "really know."
Steven says: "But your body, are you sore?"
Lars says: "No."
Steven says: "Are you tired?"
Lars says: "..."
Lars says: "No."
Steven says: "Do you feel good?"
Lars says: "No?"
Steven says: "Do you feel bad?"
Lars says: "No?!"
Lars says: "!"
Lars says: "I guess I just feel really freaked out?"
Steven says: "Well, I am, too, so at least we're on the same page here."
Looming noise are then heard in the distance.
Rhodonite says: "They're back."
Rhodonite says: "Those Shattering Robonoids are back!"
Fluorite says: "Quickly..."
Fluorite says: "Block the entrance..."
The Rutile Twins, Rhodonite and Fluorite run off to block the entrance.
Steven says: "Lars, you stay here and rest."
Lars says: "All right."
Padparadscha says: "I predict, Lars will change in hue."
Padparadscha says: "What a mystery!"
Rhodonite and the Rutile Twins begin pushing a large rock towards the entrance. Steven quickly joins them and pushes the rock with great strength, surprising the other two Gems.
Rutile Twins says: "Whoa, strong."
Steven, Rhodonite and the Rutile Twins successfully pushes the rock into place.
Rhodonite says: "Is this gonna be enough?"
The red scanning beams from the Robnoids shine from the gap in the entrance are heard, and the noises fades in distance, as the Robonoids move on elsewhere.
Fluorite says: "They.."
Fluorite says: "seem..."
Fluorite says: "to have..."
Fluorite says: "overlooked us..."
Fluorite says: "for..."
Fluorite says: "the time..."
Fluorite says: "being..."
Padparadscha says: "Quickly, block the entrance!"
Steven says: "As long as I'm here, they're gonna keep coming after us."
Rhodonite says: "It's true."
Rhodonite says: "This was a horrible plan."
Steven says: "Should we try to find a new hiding spot?"
Rhodonite says: "No, no, no!"
Rhodonite says: "If we leave this cavern, we'll be completely exposed."
Fluorite says: "But..."
Fluorite says: "if we stay here,..."
Fluorite says: "they'll..."
Fluorite says: "find us..."
Fluorite says: "for..."
Fluorite says: "sure..."
Rutile Twins says: "So, we either stay here and get caught..."
Rutile Twins says: "Or we go out there and get caught."
Lars says: "So wait..."
Lars says: "am I a zombie now?!"
Lars says: "!"
Steven says: "No!"
Steven says: "?"
Steven says: "Well..."
Steven says: "No!"
Steven says: "You can talk, and zombies can't do that."
Steven says: "I must've healed you."
Steven says: "I've healed people before, just never this much."
Lars says: "Just admit it, Steven!"
Lars says: "I'm a zombie!"
Steven says: "Oh, I know."
Steven says: "A zombie wouldn't have a heartbeat."
Steven puts his ear against Lars' chest and immediately sweats in deep concerns, hearing a slow heartbeat.
Steven says: "That's, uhh..."
Steven says: "Pretty slow."
Steven says: "But I think we can rule out pink zombie."
Rutile Twins says: "Thank the stars."
Rutile Twins says: "What's a zombie?"
Rhodonite says: "I can't believe humans just change color like this."
Steven says: "They don't."
Steven says: "Well, I guess if you get really cold, you turn blue."
Steven says: "And if you get really embarrassed, you turn red."
Rhodonite says: "So what does pink mean?"
Rhodonite says: "Is Lars gonna explode or something?"
Rutile Twins says: "Maybe then Lars will reform with a different color."
Fluorite says: "I'm..."
Fluorite says: "sure..."
Fluorite says: "whatever color..."
Fluorite says: "Lars..."
Fluorite says: "chooses..."
Fluorite says: "will be..."
Fluorite says: "lovely..."
Lars says: "*kneels down* But why am I pink?"
Steven says: "Even your hair is different."
Steven touches Lars' hair, causing it to glow, and Lars immediately backs off in shock.
Lars says: "Aah!"
Lars says: "What was that?"
Lars says: "*touches his hair* Huh?"
Lars says: "It, like, lit up, right?"
Lars says: "You saw it, too."
Steven says: "Uh, yeah!"
Lars says: "What did you do?"
Lars says: "Do it again."
Steven touches Lars' hair and it glows where his fingers are phasing into it.
Lars says: "Why is it doing that?"
Steven says: "Lars, I think I know what this is."
Steven says: "There's something I can try, but no."
Steven says: "You don't want me going in your head."
Lars says: "You're going to..."
Lars says: "possess me again?"
Steven says: "No."
Steven says: "It would be more literal."
Lars says: "Then what is it?"
Steven says: "Forget it."
Lars says: "Look, Steven, I'm not gonna get mad, okay?"
Lars says: "I trust you, just..."
Lars says: "Help me out here."
Lars says: "If I've got magic hair now, I want to know."
Steven says: "*smiles* Everyone stand back."
Rhodonite and the Rutile Twins take a few steps back. After a brief pause, Padparadscha does the same.
Steven says: "All right, now just bend down."
Lars says: "*complies* Like this?"
Steven says: "Now, you might feel a slight foot in your head."
Steven sticks his foot into Lars' hair, everyone gasps in surprise as Lars groans in repulsion.
Rhodonite says: "What is happening?"
Rhodonite says: "They're fusing!"
Rhodonite says: "They're fusing, right?"
Steven says: "You're doing great, Lars."
Lars says: "Uhh..."
Lars says: "Okay?"
Steven climbs into Lars' head, takes a deep breath and dives into it, disappearing completely.

Trans. Int. Beach House.
Steven pops out of Lion's mane, who is abruptly woken up from his sleep, and gasps for air, finding himself back in a dark and quiet beach house.
Steven says: "Ah."
Steven says: "I'm home."
Steven says: "*gets up* I'm home!"
Steven says: "Guys?"
Steven says: "Where are they?"
Steven says: "*notices a glass on the kitchen counter* Water!"
Steven quickly fills up the glass with water from the faucet and drinks deeply. He then fills up another glassful and drinks again, sighing in relief. Just then, his stomach starts to gurgle.
Steven says: "*gasps* Food."
Steven quickly makes himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and begins eating it, as tears roll down his face.
Steven says: "Life is beautiful!"
Steven begins packing a paper bag full with food and drink.
Steven says: "Got to bring some back for Lars."
Steven says: "Wish I could tell everyone I'm okay."
Lion walks up to Steven and gazes at him intently. Steven covers his mouth in another realization and holds Lion's cheek.
Steven says: "Oh, Lion."
Steven says: "So you were- *sighs* Gosh, there- there's so much I want to ask you."
Steven says: "If only you could talk."
Lion bends his head down to Steven without prompt.
Steven says: "Thanks, buddy."
Steven sticks his hand into Lion's mane, preparing to enter the pink dimension again.
Trans. Int. Homeworld Kindergarten.
Lars is poking his arm to check for his skin retention, when Steven suddenly emerges from his hair, gasping for air.
Steven says: "Aah!"
Lars says: "Aah!"
Lars loses his balance and falls onto the back, and Steven tumbles out of his head. Lars groans as he and Steven get up.
Steven says: "Sorry, Lars."
Lars says: "So what happened?"
Lars says: "What's in my head?"
Steven says: "Home."
Lars says: "Wha?"
Steven says: "Everyone, I've made an amazing discovery!"
Steven says: "I just traveled back to planet Earth by going through Lars' head!"
Lars says: "You went back to Earth?"
Lars says: "What the heck?"
Lars says: "Is my head like a wormhole?"
Steven says: "No, it's way simpler than that."
Steven says: "You see, I have a pink pet lion who belonged to my mom when she was still here, and it turns out I can go into his mane, and it transports me to a magical dimension where my mom kept a bunch of artifacts on a hill with a tree, and for some reason, I can't breathe in there."
Steven says: "But anyway, when I went into Lars' head, I got transported to the same magical dimension, but it was a new part of it, but since the two are connected, I could reach the portal that leads out of Lion's mane, which is back on Earth!"
Lars says: "*dumbstruck* Uhh..."
Steven says: "*offers Lars a sandwich* Here, I brought you some food."
Lars says: "Huh?"
Lars says: "Thanks, but I-I'll save it for later."
Steven says: "But, aren't you hungry?"
Steven says: "Maybe you only eat magical lizards now like Lion."
Steven says: "A-Are you hungry for lizards?"
Lars says: "No, I do not want a lizard."
Steven says: "But you haven't eaten in days."
Lars says: "I know."
Lars says: "There must be pink magic in my guts now or something."
Rhodonite says: "*picks up a juice box* What is this box?"
Steven says: "It's juice."
Steven says: "We drink it back on Earth."
Rhodonite says: "What?"
Rutile Twins says: "That's impossible."
Rhodonite says: "Earth?"
Rutile Twins says: "There's no way."
Rhodonite says: "Unh-unh."
Padparadscha says: "Steven's back."
Rutile Twins says: "That can't be."
Rutile Twins says: "I'm incredulous."
Steven says: "Why can't it be?"
Fluorite says: "Everyone..."
Fluorite says: "knows..."
Fluorite says: "that..."
Fluorite says: "the Earth..."
Rhodonite says: "*interrupts Fluorite* Was decimated by the Diamond attack!"
Rhodonite says: "Sorry."
Steven says: "It's not like that."
Steven says: "The Diamonds did attack, but there are still Gems living on Earth, and the planet's full of life."
Steven says: "*holds up bag of a chips* It grew the potatoes that became these chips."
Steven says: "*holds up a sandwich* And grew the wheat that eventually became the flour that eventually became the bread that eventually became this sandwich!"
Rutile Twins says: "Sand..."
Rutile Twins says: "wich?"
Rhodonite says: "But why would Gems still live there?"
Steven says: "Because the Earth is a place where we can be ourselves."
Steven says: "We can live freely without having to hide who we are."
Rutile Twins says: "Live freely?"
Rutile Twins says: "Without, having to hide?"
Fluorite says: "That..."
Fluorite says: "sounds..."
Fluorite says: "won..."
Fluorite says: "derful..."
Steven says: "It is."
Steven says: "And now that we have this portal, we can all go there."
Lars says: "All?"
Lars says: "How am I supposed to go through my own head?"
Steven says: "Ohh..."
Steven says: "Hmm..."
Trans. Int. Pink Dimension.
Steven tries pulling Lars' arm and the rest of his body into the dimension through his own hair.
Lars says: "*grunts in pain* Stop!"
Lars says: "You're gonna break my elbow!"
Steven says: "*leaves Lars' hair* Okay, so that didn't work, but I'm sure there's another way."
Lars says: "No, no, look."
Lars says: "I get it."
Lars says: "Everyone just go, and I'll stay here."
Lars says: "There's no other way out."
Lars says: "I'm it."
Lars says: "The Earth is way better than this."
Lars says: "There's no robots flying around."
Lars says: "Just seagulls that fly in front of the sunset and it's beautiful!"
Lars says: "Just go, you'll see."
Lars says: "I took it for granted, so don't pass up this chance!"
Rhodonite says: "Well, if you insist."
Rhodonite begins walking forward, but the Rutile Twins stop her.
Fluorite says: "We..."
Fluorite says: "won't..."
Fluorite says: "do it."
Fluorite says: "..."
Fluorite says: "Not if it means..."
Fluorite says: "leaving you..."
Fluorite says: "behind..."
Lars says: "What?!"
Lars says: "!"
Lars says: "I'm trying to perform a beautiful act over here."
Fluorite says: "We..."
Fluorite says: "know..."
Fluorite says: "this..."
Fluorite says: "planet."
Fluorite says: "..."
Fluorite says: "We've..."
Fluorite says: "been..."
Fluorite says: "hiding in these tunnels..."
Fluorite says: "for eons."
Fluorite says: "..."
Fluorite says: "You'll..."
Fluorite says: "need us..."
Fluorite says: "to help you..."
Fluorite says: "get around."
Fluorite says: "..."
Fluorite says: "Besides,..."
Fluorite says: "us..."
Fluorite says: "Off-Colors..."
Fluorite says: "stick..."
Fluorite says: "together."
Rutile Twins says: "We'll get to Earth another way."
Rutile Twins says: "We'll find an alternate route."
Lars says: "*points at Steven* But you've got to go back."
Steven says: "But it doesn't feel right to just leave you here."
Lars says: "You said yourself that everyone on this planet is out to get you."
Lars says: "You won't be safe until you're back on Earth."
Lars says: "Don't argue with me!"
Lars says: "You're always trying to help me."
Lars says: "You brought me back to life."
Lars says: "Just..."
Lars says: "Let me be somebody who deserved it."
Steven says: "All right, I'll tell everyone you're okay."
Steven says: "I'll be back."
Steven says: "I can bring whatever you need."
Steven says: "Be careful, okay?"
Fluorite says: "We..."
Fluorite says: "will..."
Padparadscha says: "We can't leave without Lars!"
Rhodonite says: "We'll see you on Earth, I hope."
Rhodonite says: "No, no, no."
Rhodonite says: "We will!"
Steven places his hand on Lars' chest. Lars pushes his hand out of the way and hugs Steven instead, who embraces him in return.
Steven says: "Umm..."
Steven says: "If you could just..."
Lars says: "Oh, yeah."
Lars bends his head down to Steven.
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Steven climbs back out Lion's mane, just as the Crystal Gems, Connie, and Greg shortly warp in on the Crystal Temple Warp Pad, still depressed over Steven's surrender.
Pearl says: "This is hopeless."
Steven gasps in surprise.
Pearl says: "*pacing around in panic* We'll never get that dropship to fly, and we're losing time!"
Pearl says: "Who knows what they're doing to Steven."
Pearl says: "Hi Steven."
Steven says: "I'm back!"
Everyone reacts in sheer joy and surprise at Steven's return, and they all rush to embrace Steven. The star iris then closes on Steven's face, overjoyed to be back home.
END.
