Open Ext. Dead Man's Mouth.
The Gems are standing at the top of a cliff, overlooking a moss-covered swamp. Steven is seen hopping on the rocks in the swamp.
Pearl says: "This doesn't look good at all."
Steven says: "*on a rock, reaching to touch the moss* Whoa!"
Steven says: "Cool!"
Amethyst says: "No, Steven, wait!"
Pearl says: "No, Steven!"
Pearl says: "Don't go near that stuff!"
The moss starts crawling towards Steven. Garnet throws a nearby boulder at the rock Steven is standing on, catapulting him into Pearl's arms.
Steven says: "WHOA!!!"
Steven says: "*lands on Pearl* Steven's here!"
Pearl says: "*puts Steven down* You have to be careful, Steven!"
Steven says: "Why?"
Steven says: "What is that stuff?"
Garnet says: "It's the moss that Rose Quartz raised on the hill."
Steven says: "My mom planted this stuff?"
Pearl says: "Rose Quartz used to climb that hill every spring and tend to the moss at the top."
Pearl says: "*projects a hologram of Rose at the top of a hill* But now that Rose is..."
Pearl says: "gone, the moss is on the move!"
Steven says: "*saddened* It's lost."
Amethyst says: "It's not lost."
Amethyst says: "It's gross."
Pearl says: "Yes, but Rose loved it anyway."
Pearl says: "She saw the beauty in everything, no matter how gross."
Pearl says: "*flicks her hair* Fortunately, I know just what to do in this situation."
The Crystal Gems gets off the cliff and onto ground level. Garnet, Amethyst and Steven sit down on the ground, as they watch what Pearl is going to do. She then strikes a pose.
Pearl says: "Twooooh!"
Pearl says: "*dances briefly* Haaaaaah!"
Steven says: "*whispers to Amethyst* This is why I get up in the morning!"
A small glowing object appears out of Pearl's gem and into Steven's hands, revealing a roll of yellow tape reading "POLICE LINE".
Steven says: "Is this..."
Steven says: "police tape?"
Pearl says: "Isn't this great?"
Pearl says: "This way, we don't even have to use magic."
Pearl says: "Humans will just see this and walk away."
Garnet, perched on a rock, slams her fist into her palm like a baseball mitt.
Garnet says: "Don't hold back."
Amethyst says: "I never..."
Amethyst says: "do!"
The Crystal Gems starts wrapping the entrance to the swamp in police tape.
Pearl says: "♪La la-la la-la~ *ties the police tape into a bow shape* Perfect!"
Pearl says: "♪  Now we can come up with a plan to move the moss back to its hill!"
Steven says: "Who wants to get some lunch?"
Steven says: "Just me, then?"
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "Nice."
Trans. Ext. Fish Stew Pizza.
Steven says: "*walking along the boardwalk and singing to himself* Gettin' me a pi, gettin' me a -zza."
Steven says: "/ Gettin' me a p-p-p-p-pizza!"
Steven says: "/ Gettin' me a pi, gettin' me a -zza."
Steven says: "/ Hmm, mmm, mm, mm~ Hey, is that Lars?"
Steven says: "Lars!"
Lars says: "*groans* Why now?"
Steven says: "Got a high five for you from waaaay doowwwwn toooown!"
Steven says: "*starts to run towards Lars with his arm raised high* Ohhhhhh!"
Lars says: "*whisper-yells* No, Steven!"
Lars says: "No high fives!"
Steven says: "Mmmmm, okay."
Lars says: "STEVEN!"
Steven says: "*laughs* So..."
Steven says: "how come you're not at the Big Donut?"
Lars says: "I don't spend my whole life at work."
Lars says: "*flips a jacket over his shoulder* I do..."
Lars says: "other things."
Steven says: "Like standing against this wall?"
Lars says: "What does it look like?!"
Lars says: "!"
Steven says: "Looks like you're doing a lot of nothing."
Lars says: "That's the plan, Steven."
Lars says: "*flips his jacket* Just playing it cool today, you know?"
Steven says: "We are so much alike."
Lars says: "Excuse me?"
Steven says: "You want to get a fresh pizza right out of the oven, but you don't want to seem too desperate, right?"
Steven says: "Well, there's no need to be ashamed."
Steven says: "Just walk right in and ask."
Steven says: "That's what I always do."
Lars says: "Ah, uh Steven, don't go in there right now!"
Steven says: "*looks through the windows* Oh, hey!"
Three cool kids are seen hanging around inside, while Kiki stands behind them.
Jenny says: "He opened the door, and there was doggy-doo everywhere."
Buck says: "That's nasty."
Buck says: "I don't like nasty stuff."
Sour Cream's eating a pizza.
Steven says: "Isn't that Kiki's sister and her friends?"
Lars says: "*whispering* Jenny, Sour Cream, and Buck Dewey."
Steven says: "Oh, you know those guys?"
Lars says: "N-not quite, but I'm sure we'll hang at some point."
Steven says: "You should go in and talk to them."
Lars says: "*starts to fluster* T-T-That's not how these things work, Steven!"
Lars says: "The plan is to keep it cool and let them come to me."
Jenny, Sour Cream, and Buck exits Fish Stew Pizza.
Steven says: "Here they come."
Lars says: "Aah!"
Lars says: "Steven, turn around!"
Lars says: "Act natural!"
Jenny says: "*to Kiki* Tell Dad I'll be back later."
Steven says: "I don't think they saw you."
Lars says: "Steven, you were blocking me with your..."
Lars says: "big hair!"
Lars says: "Aah!"
Steven says: "Sorry, I'll go tell them to look over here."
Lars says: "*whispering* Steven, no, don't go over there!"
Lars says: "I hate you!"
Buck says: "Muffins that are like, this big."
Jenny says: "Those things are too sweet for me."
Steven says: "Hi!"
Steven says: "My name's Steven."
Buck says: "*high-fives* Buck Dewey."
Sour Cream says: "*high-fives* They call me Sour Cream."
Jenny says: "*high-fives* I'm Jenny."
Lars says: "*hand over his mouth, thinking to himself* Aah, he's gonna wreck everything!"
Lars says: "What are they saying?"
Lars says: "I can't hear them!"
Lars says: "Ugh!"
Lars says: "Why is he dancing?!"
Lars says: "!"
Lars says: "*starts sobbing* No-ho-ho!"
Lars says: "My life is horrible!"
Steven says: "Hey, Lars!"
Lars says: "*snaps into a "cool" pose* Yo."
Steven says: "They invited us along for a ride."
Lars says: "Huh?"
Lars says: "W-Wait a minute, they—"
Lars says: "you—"
Lars says: "?"
Lars says: "Steven, you got lucky."
Lars says: "So don't ruin this with any of your lame schtick."
Steven says: "*pretends to shoot his fingers* Pew pew!"
Steven says: "You got it!"
Lars face-palms. The whole group then walks towards Jenny's Car.
Jenny says: "Hop on in guys."
Steven says: "Ah yeah, middle seat!"
The group files into the car. Buck, Steven, and Lars are seated in the back, Sour Cream in the front passenger, and Jenny is the driver.
Buck says: "Where'd you get that rad shirt, Steven?"
Steven says: "*tugs his shirt* I have no idea where any of my clothes come from."
Buck says: "Yeah man, living free."
Buck says: "I like it."
Lars says: "Hey, check out my shirt."
Buck says: "Oh, that snake is nasty."
Lars says: "Oh."
Lars says: "*fakes an laugh* Yeah, I hate snakes!"
Buck says: "Oh, what?"
Buck says: "That's too bad, some snakes are pretty cool."
Jenny starts up the car.
Steven says: "Sounds like it's time to buckle up!"
Lars says: "Quit being lame, Steven."
Sour Cream says: "Hey man, there's nothing "lame" about seat belt safety."
Jenny says: "Car does not move 'till we're all buckled up."
Sour Cream says: "Yeah, now let's get some spaced-out beats up in here."
Sour Cream says: "*tunes the car radio to an electronica station* Yeah, I could rave to this."
Lars says: "*to Jenny* Hey, this car is really cool Jenny."
Jenny says: "It's just the delivery car for my Dad's lame shop."
Jenny says: "Makes me smell like pizza."
Jenny says: "Where to, y'all?"
Buck says: "I don't even know."
Steven says: "Oh, can we stop by the Big Donut?"
Jenny says: "*drives up next to the Big Donut* That old place?"
Buck says: "Man that place is a drag."
Steven says: "But that's where Lars works—"
Lars says: "*starts coughing loudly* Quiet Steven."
Steven says: "You need some water?"
Trans. Int. Beach City.
The group drives through the heart of town.
Steven says: "*notices the Funland Arcade* Funland Arcade is the best!"
Steven says: "Let's do that!"
Sour Cream says: "Man, I beat all the "G's" in there like 3 million times."
Steven says: "*gasps* No way!"
Lars says: "Yeah, me too."
Steven says: "No way!!"
Sour Cream says: "Honestly though, I'm just exaggerating to sound cool."
Steven says: "*pats Sour Cream on the shoulder* I appreciate your honesty."
The group drives up next to the city park, where Mayor Dewey is holding a rally.
Jenny says: "Hey Buck, isn't that your dad?"
Mayor Dewey says: "..."
Mayor Dewey says: "Another reason you should re-elect me, I love babies."
Mayor Dewey says: "Will you look at that, a baby!"
Mayor Dewey says: "Gonna kiss it..."
Steven says: "Hmm, I like his policies on babies."
Buck says: "Man, he never kisses me like that."
Lars says: "That's rough, bro."
Buck says: "It's not rough."
Buck says: "The lack of daddy kisses in my life made me who I am."
Jenny says: "Oh my gosh guys, we should check out Dead Man's Mouth."
Steven says: "What's Dead Man's Mouth?"
Buck says: "Oh it's this lake where some dude died, or it looks like a mouth?"
Buck says: "I forget the specifics."
Jenny says: "Dead Man's Mouth."
Jenny says: "Here."
Jenny says: "We."
Jenny says: "Come!"
Steven says: "Sounds good to me."
Trans. Dead Man's Mouth.
The group steps out of the car.
Jenny says: "We're here.."
Steven notices the police tape the Crystal Gems put up earlier and realizes.
Steven says: "Y-ya know what?"
Steven says: "I know this place may seem cool, but it's actually a lot less cool than you think."
Steven says: "W-why don't we just go have some more fun at the boardwalk?"
Lars says: "*glares at Steven* Steven, stop being lame."
Lars says: "*to the others* Let's check this place out."
Lars walks towards the entrance of the swamp. The others murmur in agreement and accompany him.
Steven says: "*begins to worry but stops* Oh, pfft, the police tape."
The group stares at the police tape surrounding the entrance.
Sour Cream says: "Huh, police tape.."
Sour Cream says: "*rips down the tape bow, Steven gasps, walks through* Awesome."
Buck says: "I'm above the law."
Jenny says: "Who wants to go for a swim?"
Steven stares in worry at the moss, visibly agitated. The others begin to take off their coats, while Sour Cream converts his pants into shorts.
Sour Cream says: "Pants become shorts."
Lars quickly takes off his shirt and begins to walk toward the swamp.
Steven says: "*stops Lars* Lars, don't go in there, it's dangerous!"
Jenny says: "Steven, you trying to scare us?"
Buck says: "Build an atmosphere, I appreciate that."
Sour Cream says: "*swaying his fingers* Oooooh!"
Steven says: "Wait!"
Buck says: "I'm not that slow."
Jenny, Sour Cream and Buck jump into the swamp. Lars tries to follow suit but Steven holds him in place.
Lars says: "Hey, what are you doing man?!"
Lars says: "!"
Steven says: "*tearing up* Don't!"
Lars says: "*pushes Steven along towards the swamp* Steven, what."
Lars says: "Is."
Lars says: "Your."
Lars says: "Deal??"
Lars tries to push Steven off but stops when he notices the others are suddenly engulfed and dragged underwater by the growing moss around them. Lars falls back in fear.
Lars says: "Aah!"
Steven says: "Oh no!"
Steven says: "Aaah!"
Lars says: "What's going on?!"
Lars says: "!"
Steven says: "It's some kind of magic moss my Mom planted!"
Lars says: "Wait, your mom—"
Lars says: "?"
Suddenly, Jenny, Sour Cream and Buck reemerge on the water surface, covered in moss. They crawl towards the edge of the swamp and collapse, as the moss covers their whole bodies entirely.
Lars says: "Guys, hang on!"
Lars and Steven starts ripping away the moss off of Jenny, Sour Cream and Buck, but the moss rapidly grows back. Steven thinks for a moment and sees the hill in the background.
Lars says: "This is all your fault!"
Lars says: "*tears up and yells at Steven* I knew if something went wrong today it would be because of you!"
Lars says: "Now I'm never going to be friends with these guys."
Lars says: "All because of your..."
Lars says: "weird mom!"
Steven's eyes narrow in shock and rage.
Steven says: "*pokes at Lars' chest* What do YOU know about my mom?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "I DIDN'T EVEN GET TO KNOW MY MOM!"
Steven says: "But I DO know, she saw beauty in everything!"
Steven says: "Even in stuff like THIS!"
Steven says: "*points at the moss* And even in jerks like YOU!"
Lars looks away, ashamed, and Steven sighs.
Steven says: "Now help me get them to the car."
Steven and Lars drag the moss-covered bodies into the car and buckle them in.
Steven says: "Lars, hurry!"
Steven says: "This moss belongs at the top of that hill."
Steven says: "*points at the hill in the background* Come on Lars, what are you waiting for?"
Lars says: "Uh, Steven, I don't know how to drive a stick shift."
Steven says: "I'll work the stick, you just keep us on the road."
Lars says: "Okay, alright, let's do this."
Lars says: "Ignition!"
Steven says: "Stick power!"
Lars says: "Steven, no, put it in reverse!"
Steven says: "Is that the one with "R" on it?"
Steven says: "*shifts the gear again* Aaaaah!"
The car jolts backwards and reverses all the way back onto the road. Lars starts driving towards the hill as the moss engulfs the back of the car.
Lars says: "Jenny's gonna kill MEEEEEE!"
Lars says: "What's gonna happen when we get to the top of that hill?"
Steven says: "I don't know!"
Lars says: "You don't know?!"
Lars says: "!"
Steven says: "That's just where the moss wants to be!"
Steven says: "Aah!"
Lars says: "Huh?"
Lars says: "Aaaah!"
Lars says: "It's getting everywhere!"
Lars says: "Woah!"
Lars and Steven momentarily loses control of the car, until they bump into a large truck, leaving a dent in it, but straighten them back on their path.
Steven says: "We made it!"
Lars says: "We're almost there."
Lars says: "*eventually reaches and parks the car near the top of the hill* What do we do now?"
Steven says: "We got to get up there."
Steven says: "Hurry!"
Steven and Lars starts dragging the bodies up the hill, but the moss progressively engulfs them as well, slowing them down.
Lars says: "I'm..."
Lars says: "getting stuck!"
Steven says: "No, don't..."
Steven says: "give up."
The moss completely engulfs Steven and Lars' bodies, leaving their faces, and immobilizes them.
Lars says: "Steven..."
Steven says: "What?"
Lars says: "..."
Lars says: "This sucks!"
Steven says: "Laaaaar—"
Steven says: "—"
All seems lost, as the moss-covered bodies lay still on the hill. Just then, the clouds begin to clear and the sun starts shining in. Pink flowers begin to blossom all over the moss and float away. The group is freed from the moss as they gasp for air. Steven and Lars watch over the edge of the hill as the pink flowers fill the sky.
Steven says: "The moss was just trying to bloom."
Jenny says: "Ughh, what happened?"
Sour Cream says: "I think I died."
Jenny says: "Guys, look!"
Jenny says: "*rushes to the edge of the hill* Woah!"
Sour Cream says: "*rushes to the edge of the hill* Woah!"
Buck says: "*rushes to the edge of the hill* Woah!"
The group watches as the flowers waft gently in the sunset all over Beach City.
Sour Cream says: "You can see all of Beach City from up here."
Buck says: "It's beautiful."
Jenny says: "Yeah..."
Jenny says: "how did we even get here?"
Lars says: "Well, Steven thought that—"
Steven says: "*interrupts* Lars drove us here."
Jenny says: "*murmur* Oh yeah, Lars!"
Sour Cream says: "*murmur* Oh yeah, Lars!"
Buck says: "*murmur* Oh yeah, Lars!"
Jenny says: "Super cool."
Sour Cream says: "Super cool."
Buck says: "Super cool."
Sour Cream says: "I can totally rave to this."
Jenny says: "Go go go..."
Buck says: "Go go go..."
Jenny says: "Sour Cream!"
Buck says: "Sour Cream!"
Jenny says: "Sour Cream!"
Buck says: "Sour Cream!"
Steven attempts a high five with Lars but Lars high-fives his chest instead.
Steven says: "*laughs* Yeah!"
The star iris starts zooming in on Lars' face.
Lars says: "*feeling embarrassed* Okay, that's enough."
END.
