Open Ext. Beach Citywalk Fries.
Steven and Amethyst run towards the counter of Beach Citywalk Fries, as Mr. Fryman is entering the building.
Steven says: "Hey, Fryman, give me the bits!"
Mr. Fryman says: "*flips a "We're Closed!"
Mr. Fryman says: "" sign* Steven!"
Mr. Fryman says: "We're closed."
Steven says: "*disappointed* Aww, what?"
Amethyst says: "*hits counter* Give 'em the bits!"
Amethyst says: "*chants while continuously hitting the counter* The BITS."
Amethyst says: "The BITS."
Steven joins in the chanting.
Steven says: "*both chanting* The BITS!"
Amethyst says: "*both chanting* The BITS!"
Steven says: "The BITS!"
Amethyst says: "The BITS!"
Steven says: "The BITS!"
Amethyst says: "The BITS!"
Mr. Fryman says: "Okay, okay!"
Mr. Fryman says: "Take it easy on the counter, will ya?"
Steven says: "Yes!"
Amethyst says: "Yes!"
Mr. Fryman says: "*empties the bits into a paper bag* I can give you actual fries if you want."
Steven says: "Just the bits, please."
Steven says: "*takes the bag* Thanks!"
Steven says: "*Amethyst and him start walking away while eating the bits* Ah, sunset, my favorite time of day."
Steven says: "When the sun goes down, and the second sun gets bigger and bigger in the sky."
Amethyst says: "*bursts out laughing* Yeah, that big hot second su—"
Amethyst says: "*long gasps, noticing a strange orb in the sky* Oh no, what is that doing here?"
Steven says: "Huh?"
Steven says: "What is it?"
Steven says: "Ah, my bits!"
Steven says: "(Amethyst carries him away"
Steven says: "."
Trans. beach near Crystal Temple.
Garnet and Pearl, looking through a telescope, are observing the strange orb.
Garnet says: "This is bad."
Pearl says: "Look at the size of it, I had no idea these things were so big!"
Amethyst says: "Garnet!"
Amethyst says: "Pearl!"
Pearl says: "*visibly annoyed* We saw."
Pearl says: "Some of us are trying to protect humanity."
Pearl says: "Where were you?"
Amethyst says: "*puts Steven down*..."
Amethyst says: "Eating fry bits."
Steven says: "Oh, can I see?"
Steven says: "*peers through the telescope* Woah."
Steven says: "It's a giant eyeball!"
Steven says: "Awesome!"
Pearl says: "NOT awesome!"
Pearl says: "It's a Red Eye!"
Steven says: "A red eye?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "It's going to infect us all!"
Garnet says: "That's pink eye, Steven."
Pearl says: "It's going to crash into Beach City and crush us, along with a bunch of oblivious, innocent people!"
Pearl says: "We have to stop it."
Steven says: "What are we going to do?"
Garnet says: "*adjusts her visor* The only thing powerful enough to destroy it is a Laser Cannon that belonged to Rose Quartz."
Steven says: "My mom?"
Amethyst says: "*moans* If Rose were here, this would be so easy."
Pearl says: "I know, but she's not, and the cannon is missing."
Pearl says: "We'll have to find another solution."
Steven says: "If it belonged to my mom, I bet my dad knows where it is."
Steven says: "He can help us save the day!"
Steven says: "Huh?"
Steven says: "Ehh!"
Steven says: "?"
Pearl says: "Greg is..."
Pearl says: "nice, Steven, but I doubt Rose would entrust someone like him with such a powerful weapon."
Amethyst says: "Your dad is kind of a mess, Steven."
Pearl says: "Amethyst!"
Amethyst says: "I'm just sayin', even if she did leave it with him, he probably broke it, or lost it, or dropped it in the ocean by now."
Garnet says: "True."
Steven says: "No way, I'm sure he's just keeping it somewhere safe."
Steven says: "I'll go ask him."
Garnet says: "We can handle this, Steven."
Garnet says: "*to Amethyst* Ready?"
Amethyst nods. Garnet picks her up, leaps into the air and tosses her at the Red Eye. Amethyst hits it with no impact at all and falls into the ocean. Garnet and Pearl are dumbfounded.
Steven says: "Ugh..."
Steven says: "I'm gonna go."
Pearl says: "..."
Pearl says: "Okay, good luck."
Ext. It's a Wash.
Steven says: "*banging on the back doors of a van* Dad, it's me!"
Steven says: "Dad, are you in there?"
Steven says: "*starts ramming into it* Wake- UP!"
Steven says: "We have to save the- WORLD!"
Steven says: "*climbs onto the van and start stomping on it* Dad!"
Greg says: "*bursts out of the van* Who's there?!"
Greg says: "!"
Greg says: "I have a waffle iron!"
Steven says: "Dad, it's me!"
Greg says: "*turns around and sees him, as he drops the waffle iron and shuts the van alarm off* Steven?"
Greg says: "I almost waffled your face!"
Greg says: "What are you doing up so late?"
Steven says: "What do you mean?"
Steven says: "The sun just went down an hour ago."
Greg says: "Oh, heh."
Greg says: "*embarrassed* It was a..."
Greg says: "slow day at the car wash."
Greg says: "Anyway, what's up?"
Greg says: "Just needed to see your old man?"
Greg says: "Pal around?"
Greg says: "Learn some lessons about life?"
Steven says: "*blushes* No!"
Steven says: "I need the light cannon that belonged to Mom, to blow up that eyeball!"
Greg says: "Eyeball?"
Steven says: "That!"
Amethyst is seen flying and yelling towards the Red Eye, hitting it, and falling back into the ocean again.
Greg says: "Wait, is that a magical thing?"
Greg says: "The Gems told me not to get involved with magic stuff."
Greg says: "It..."
Greg says: "it could be dangerous or interfere with what's left of my hair."
Steven says: "But they need Mom's cannon."
Steven says: "You've gotta know where it is, like a cave dungeon or a cloud fortress, or in a clam at the bottom of the ocean!"
Greg puts up the waffle iron on the ground, throws it into the van and shuts the doors.
Greg says: "Well, I don't know about all that."
Greg says: "But I have an idea where it might be."
Ext. U-Stor.
Steven says: "A magical storage unit!"
Greg says: "Ha, not exactly."
Greg says: "But some would say there's magic inside."
Greg says: "*winks at Steven, who looks at him cluelessly* It's just a shed I use to keep things that don't fit in the van."
Greg says: "If it's anywhere, it'll be in here."
Greg opens the door and reveals a shed filled to the brim with boxes and clutter. Steven tries to make his way in, but the first few boxes collapse in front of him.
Steven says: "If I'm going in there, I'm gonna need some gear."
Steven says: "*ties a flashlight to his head with a nearby sock, and an electric cord wrapped around his waist* Here I go."
Greg says: "*holding the other end of the cord* Good luck!"
Steven says: "*crawls into the shed* Woah, cool!"
Steven says: "It's like a dad museum."
Steven says: "*ventures deeper and notices a long object on the floor* There it is!"
Steven says: "*pulls it out, revealing to be a golf bag* Do you golf?"
Greg says: "Eh, I'd like to think of myself as someone who would golf..."
Greg says: "eventually."
Steven says: "*sets the golf bag upright and notices another slender object* Hmm, yes!"
Steven says: "*sweeps off the various junk on top of it* A drum."
Steven says: "*pats it once and continues rummaging deeper* No, no..."
Steven says: "*gasps* Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!"
Steven says: "Is this—"
Steven says: "*shoots a cannon-like object, the projectile unravels into a shirt* “Buy T-Shirt Cannons”?"
Steven says: "*notices a box full of CDs near him* Hey, there's a bunch of copies of your old CD!"
Greg says: "Huh."
Greg says: "Oh, man, I couldn't give those things away."
Greg says: "You know, before I ran the car wash, when I was a one-man band, I traveled the whole country."
Steven says: "*chuckles as he keeps one of the CDs in his pocket* I know, Dad."
Greg says: "When I came to play a concert here in Beach City, no one showed up except—"
Steven says: "An ALLIGATOR!"
Greg says: "No, it was your mother."
Steven says: "Hahaha, I know."
Greg says: "And we were always together after that."
Greg says: "Until she gave up her physical form to bring you into the world."
Greg says: "I don't know what a magic lady like her ever saw in a plain old dope like me."
Steven says: "*accidentally steps on a photo frame of Greg and Rose and gasps* Uh, Dad, I broke a photo."
Greg says: "It's okay buddy."
Greg says: "If every pork chop were perfect, we wouldn't have hot dogs."
Steven says: "*something begins to glow near him* Huh?"
Steven says: "*gasps* The light cannon!"
Greg says: "*looking at Red Eye, nearer than before* Oh boy, that thing's giving me the willies."
Steven says: "Dad, I found it!"
Greg says: "Really?"
Steven says: "*ties the electric cord around the cannon* Get the van!"
Steven says: "This thing could save the city, we've gotta get it to the beach!"
Greg says: "How?"
Greg says: "It's too big for the van."
Greg ties the wagon to the van with the electric cord. Steven and Greg lift the heavy cannon.
Greg says: "Easy does it."
Int. Greg's Van.
Steven and Greg are driving to the beach, dragging the cannon with the damaged wagon.
Steven says: "Is it gonna be okay?"
Greg says: "*shrugs* If every pork chop were perfect—"
Steven says: "*chimes in* We wouldn't have hot dogs!"
Greg says: "*watches the Red Eye getting bigger* That thing's getting huge, it's freaking me out!"
Steven says: "Can't the van go any faster?"
Greg says: "*steps the van accelerator* This is faster!"
Steven says: "Don't worry."
Steven says: "Come on, let's put on your CD."
Greg says: "*embarrassed* What?"
Greg says: "Really?"
Greg says: "Come on, you've heard it."
Steven says: "*chuckles* You come on."
Amethyst says: "*gets washed up back on shore* Throw me again, I think I'm cracking it."
Amethyst says: "*notices Steven, Greg and the cannon* Is that..."
Amethyst says: "?"
Steven says: "Hey, guys!"
Pearl says: "*gasps* He really had it!"
Amethyst says: "We're SAVED!!!"
Pearl says: "Woah!"
Amethyst says: "Woah!"
Garnet says: "Woah!"
Destruction begins to ensure as everything is being pulled away by the Red Eye's gravitational force, such as the Beach House, electric poles and the Beach Citywalk Fries.
Mr. Fryman says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy!"
Trans. Beach.
Garnet says: "We have to use it now."
Pearl says: "I don't know how it works, it was Rose's!"
Steven says: "Dad, how do we use it?"
Pearl says: "*grabs Steven's shoulders* Steven, this is serious!"
Pearl says: "*epiphanised* The gem."
Pearl says: "You have Rose's gem!"
Amethyst says: "That's it!"
Amethyst says: "*lifts Steven and start rubbing him against the cannon* Ahhh, come on!"
Garnet says: "Stop that."
Pearl says: "It's no use."
Amethyst says: "Fine, forget it."
Amethyst says: "Throw me again!"
Pearl says: "That's not going to work."
The gravitational pull intensifies and starts to pull the van and the cannon too.
Greg says: "I got this."
Greg says: "*unties the cord from the cannon, as the van continues to be pulled* Ugh, wait, nope, maybe I don't!"
Steven says: "*starts banging on the cannon* Please work- unlock- activate- go- please!"
Steven says: "Everyone's counting on you, you can't just be useless!"
Steven says: "I know you can help."
Greg says: "It's okay, Steven."
Greg says: "We'll figure out something else, something even better."
Steven says: "R-r-r-right, if every pork chop were perfect, we wouldn't have hot dogs."
The cannon starts to glow and activate. Steven loses his grip and falls onto the ground.
Pearl says: "It's working!"
The cannon's hinges unlock and the barrel falls onto the ground. The Crystal Gems gasp as it begins to prime itself. Steven tries to lift the cannon himself, and the Crystal Gems help in.
Pearl says: "Steven!"
Amethyst says: "This is it!"
Garnet says: "BRACE YOURSELVES!!!"
The cannon fires a rose-shaped beam at the Red Eye, shattering and destroying it. Shrapnel from the blast begin to fall around the beach and destroying parts of the city boardwalk.
Amethyst says: "Steven, you just saved most of Beach City!"
Steven says: "*to Mr."
Steven says: "Fryman* Sorry about that!"
Mr. Fryman says: "*yells back* What?"
Pearl says: "How did you get it to work?"
Steven says: "I just said that thing that Dad always says."
Pearl says: "That thing about pork rinds?"
Garnet says: "*pats on Pearl's shoulder* Hot dogs."
Greg says: "Rose..."
The tide suddenly raises in and everyone starts laughing. Greg notices his van getting washed past him by the tide.
Greg says: "My van!"
Steven says: "It's okay, Dad, if every pork chop were perfect—"
Greg says: "I live in there!"
Steven says: "Wait up!"
Greg says: "Oh geez, wait, wait, wait!"
Greg and Steven slowly track through the water towards the van, slowly being washed towards the ocean. The star iris zooms in on the van, ending the episode.
END.
