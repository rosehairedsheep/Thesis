Steven says: "Hey, Blue Lace."
Blue Lace smashes dough being made.
Steven says: "*coughs and laughs* Hey, Lars!"
Lars says: "Hey, Steven!"
Lars says: "Here to pick up the cake?"
Steven says: "Yeah, but I also want to see how you're doing."
Sadie Miller enters the shop.
Sadie says: "Hey, Steven!"
Sadie says: "Hi, Lars!"
Steven says: "Sadie!"
Steven says: "Oh my gosh."
Steven says: "I can't remember the last time we were all together in a pastry establishment."
Lars says: "Hey Sadie, I've got your moon cakes."
Sadie says: "Thanks."
Lars says: "Sure."
Lars says: "So, how's stuff going with Shep?"
Steven says: "Huh?"
Steven says: "Shep?"
Sadie says: "Great."
Sadie says: "They're so cool."
Sadie says: "I can't believe we've been dating for almost two months, now."
Sadie says: "Everything just feels so, easy."
Lars says: "That's, awesome."
Lars says: "Say "Hi" to them for me."
Sadie says: "Will do."
Sadie says: "Well, see you later."
Lars says: "Yeah."
Steven says: "What was that, and who is Shep?"
Lars says: "Shep is Sadie's new partner."
Lars says: "They met while she was on tour with the Suspects."
Lars says: "It's cool."
Steven says: "Is it?"
Lars says: "Yes, it is."
Lars says: "Besides, I'm leaving anyway."
Lars says: "Now that the Off Colors are done with school, we're going to head back into space."
Steven says: "*gasps* But what about the shop?"
Lars says: "I asked Blue Lace to take over."
Lars says: "I'm ready to move on."
Lars says: "You get it, right?"
Lars says: "You're finished setting up the school."
Lars says: "Don't you want to try something new?"
Steven says: "Well, I..."
Steven says: "hmm."
Lars says: "Oh."
Lars says: "Looks like the graduation cake is ready."
Lars says: "I'll see you tonight, Steven."
Steven says: "Yeah."
Steven says: "We're all proud to see our graduates evolve and be there for each other as everyone moves on to bigger and better things and new and exciting places."
Steven says: "Well, except for me."
Steven says: "I'll still be, right here."
Steven says: "Ahem."
Steven says: "Alright."
Steven says: "Graduates, move those tassels!"
The graduates moves their tassels from their right to their left.
Steven says: "And with that, let's give them a hearty con-grad-ulations!"
Everyone celebrates, and a party ensues after. Steven floats down to Sadie and Shep with style.
Steven says: "Whhhat up, Sadie?"
Steven loses his gliding and collapses.
Sadie says: "Steven!"
Sadie says: "I don't think you've had a chance to meet my new partner."
Shep says: "Hey!"
Shep says: "I'm Shep."
Shep says: "It's cool to finally meet you."
Steven says: "So..."
Steven says: "you and Sadie have been dating for almost two months?"
Shep says: "That, is true."
Steven says: "You know, a lotta people say you don't really know someone until you've been stranded on an island with them."
Shep says: "What?"
Shep says: "People say that?"
Steven says: "Yeah."
Shep says: "Well..."
Shep says: "we're gonna go grab some cake before we go on at 7:00."
Sadie says: "*laughs* yeah."
Steven says: "Wait."
Steven says: "Sadie."
Steven says: "Isn't that when you're singing with the Suspects?"
Sadie says: "Actually, I was thinking of doing a song with Shep."
Steven says: "Oh, uh, cool."
Steven says: "Can't wait to hear it."
Shep says: "We'll catch you later, Steven."
Steven frowns and blocks Lars from advancing to the same cake place.
Steven says: "I wouldn't go over there right now."
Lars says: "Is something wrong with the cake?"
Steven says: "What?"
Steven says: "No, no."
Steven says: "Sadie and Shep are over there."
Lars says: "Oh, cool."
Lars says: "I'll go over and say hi."
Steven says: "H-hold on!"
Steven says: "A-are you okay?"
Lars says: "Yeah."
Lars says: "Are you okay?"
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "Why wouldn't I be?"
Steven looks at Jenny Pizza and floats on by.
Jenny says: "Hey, Steven!"
Jenny says: "Looks like everyone's enjoying the graduation so far."
Steven says: "Yep."
Steven says: "Everyone but me."
Steven says: "*sighs* I guess, it seems like everyone's got something new going on."
Jenny says: "Yeah."
Jenny says: "It's not a bad thing, though."
Jenny says: "Sour Cream has regular gigs as a DJ in Empire City."
Jenny says: "Buck got into medical school."
Jenny says: "He's gonna be saving lives in, like, 20 years, and I've been full steam ahead on jackets for phones."
Steven says: "What's that?"
Jenny says: "It's my new online business."
Jenny says: "We- and by we, I mean I -- make the finest jackets perfectly sized for your mobile device."
Steven says: "Aw, it's got little pockets- *gasps* and a little phone in one of the pockets!"
Steven says: "Everyone on the planet is gonna want one of these."
Steven says: "How are you gonna find the time?"
Jenny says: "Well, I'm gonna have plenty of time now that the Suspects are breaking up."
Steven says: "What?!"
Steven says: "!"
Jenny says: "Did Sadie not tell you?"
Steven says: "Uhh..."
Sadie says: "Hey, Steven."
Sadie says: "Are you ready for us?"
Steven says: "Oh!"
Steven says: "Right!"
Steven says: "Wait, I-I-I've gotta introduce you."
Steven says: "*walks to mic* Hey."
Steven says: "Is every-everyone having a good time tonight?"
Steven says: "*crowd cheers* Who here loves Sadie Killer and the Suspects?"
Steven says: "Well, our band tonight has, only one of them."
Lars says: "Oh, jeez."
Steven says: "So, yeah, here's, uh- what's your new band called?"
Sadie says: "Um, we don't have a name yet."
Steven says: "Uh, heh, well, you should've asked me, hum, I'm really good at naming bands."
Sadie says: "*on mic* This is just a little something Shep and I have been putting together, and, w-we really hope you like it."
Shep says: "We welcome any and all critique after the show."
Steven says: "Lars?"
Lars says: "Ah."
Lars says: "Hey, Steven."
Steven says: "Lars, wait up."
Steven says: "Hey, Lars, where are you going?"
Lars says: "I think I'm gonna bounce."
Lars says: "I just wanted to be here for the crew."
Lars says: "These big parties aren't really my thing."
Steven says: "But, you're leaving the planet tomorrow, aren't you?"
Steven says: "When am I going to see you again?"
Lars says: "Dude, you can visit me whenever."
Lars says: "I'm like, your magic portal, remember?"
Steven says: "W-w-wait."
Steven says: "Don't go yet."
Lars says: "It's been real, Steven."
Steven says: "Lars..."
Steven says: "*enters his pink state* STOP!"
Lars hits Steven's generated force field, the latter multiplying to form a dome that traps everyone at the graduation ceremony.
Lars says: "*bangs force field* Steven, what are you doing?"
Steven says: "Sorry, I-I don't know how I did this."
Lars says: "Well, just fix it."
Steven says: "Right, right, yeah, okay, umm, *grunts*..."
Steven says: "Huh."
Jenny says: "You don't have any idea why this happened?"
Steven says: "I think this dome activated as a reaction to some powerful feeling someone here has been bottling up."
Steven says: "And, I guess we all know who that is."
Steven says: "Lars!"
Lars says: "What are you talking about?!"
Lars says: "!"
Steven says: "We won't be able to leave until you work out your feelings towards Sadie."
Steven says: "You guys haven't even talked since you got back."
Sadie says: "We did, though..."
Sadie says: "Look, Steven."
Sadie says: "The two of us tried to reconnect a few times, but, we both just, grew apart."
Lars says: "Sadie knows I miss her, but she knows how happy I am that she found someone better for her."
Shep says: "Awww."
Sadie says: "And Lars knows I'm really glad he found himself in space with his new Gem friends."
Steven says: "But when did this happen?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "I didn't see any of this!"
Sadie says: "That's because it was private."
Jenny says: "..."
Steven says: "But, I thought you were only leaving because you were jealous of Shep."
Lars says: "I'm leaving because I like being in space."
Lars says: "There are still adventures waiting for us out there."
Lars says: "We can take what we've learned to other planets!"
Steven says: "But if there's nothing to work out..."
Steven says: "*looks nervously at everyone* Is it getting claustrophobic in here, o-or is it just me?"
In response to Steven's emotion, the dome closes in on itself. Those trapped try to halt its progress through pushing.
Jenny says: "Steven, You wanna get rid of this dome already?!"
Jenny says: "!"
Steven says: "Okay."
Steven says: "I can control this."
Steven says: "I just gotta think real hard!"
Shep says: "Hey, Steven?"
Steven says: "Not now, Shep."
Steven says: "I need to concentrate."
Steven says: "Look!"
Steven says: "If I don't figure out how to get rid of this dome, all my friends are gonna die!"
Lars says: "Wouldn't be the first time."
Shep says: "Well, but, your magic's all about your feelings, right?"
Shep says: "I don't know."
Shep says: "It just seems like you're sad about all your friends drifting away, so you trapped us all in this dome to keep us from leaving."
Steven says: "I don't see the connection."
Shep says: "Maybe, you're trying to figure yourself out right now, and you want your friends along to help you through it."
Steven says: "It's just that, I've always been trying to help my friends!"
Steven says: "I don't know who I am without them!"
Sadie says: "Steven, you're great, but you need to let us live our own lives."
Shep says: "If you don't give people room to grow, you'll suffocate them."
Shep says: "In this case, literally."
Steven says: "I know."
Steven says: "I don't want to hold any of you back."
Steven says: "I just can't help it if my dumb heart misses you guys."
Jenny says: "Awww, Steven!"
Sadie says: "We'll still be your friends."
Lars says: "Even if we're light-years away."
Steven says: "You guys..."
Steven says: ".."
Steven's normal color comes back and the dome dissipates, freeing everyone from impending doom.
Jenny says: "Hm."
Jenny says: "That wasn't the worst party I've been to."
Jenny says: "See ya, Steven."
Sadie says: "It was nice seeing you again."
Steven says: "Yeah."
Steven says: "You guys are a really good couple, and I really like your new sound."
Shep says: "Want a CD?"
Steven says: "Have any tape cassettes?"
Shep says: "I got you right here."
Shep says: "Take it easy!"
Lars says: "So, yeah, Steven."
Lars says: "Me and the crew are gonna..."
Steven says: "Lars, *chuckles regretfully* I'm, I'm really sorry."
Lars says: "Yeah."
Lars says: "I guess, it's kinda cute how bad you don't want me to leave."
Steven says: "Of course I don't want you to leave!"
Lars says: "Buck up, man."
Lars says: "Just come and visit."
Steven says: "It's just, for a second, we were all home together again."
Steven says: "*sighs* I don't think I like graduations."
Steven says: "Maybe I should quit running Little Homeschool."
Lars says: "..."
Lars says: "Hey."
Lars says: "*wraps arm on Steven* Come here."
Steven returns with a big hug, and Lars reciprocates.
Lars says: "..."
Lars says: "Are you gonna let me go anytime soon?"
Steven says: "Just a couple more minutes."
Looking Forward plays as Steven looks to Little Homeschool welcoming new student, though saddened. He drives to a forest and lays atop his car, staring into the night sky and reflecting on what his next calling should be.
END.
