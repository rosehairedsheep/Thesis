Open Ext. The Barn.
Following the events in "Earthlings", Steven, Amethyst and Peridot return back to the barn to find the five Rubies, trapped in water bubbles by Lapis, and their Roaming Eye parked nearby. Garnet and Pearl are also in the scene.
Steven says: "The Rubies are back?!"
Steven says: "!"
Lapis says: "They showed up on their little ship acting very angry."
Lapis says: "So I put them in time-out."
Steven says: "I thought we were done with these guys!"
Steven says: "*walks up to the Rubies* Why did you come back here?"
Garnet says: "Let's release one and just ask what they're up to."
Steven says: "Ooh, ooh!"
Steven says: "Can I pick?"
Garnet says: "Go for it."
Steven walks closer and scans through the Rubies.
Steven says: "Hmm..."
Steven says: "Oh!"
Steven says: "Let's talk to "Leggy"!"
Pearl says: ""Leggy"?"
Steven says: "I named them based on the placement of their gems."
Steven says: "There's "Leggy", "Army", "Navy", "Eyeball", and, uh..."
Steven says: ""Doc"."
Steven says: ""Leggy" seems like the easiest to talk to."
Lapis says: ""Leggy", come on down!"
Lapis pops the water bubble trapping "Leggy", and she falls onto the ground.
Steven says: "Hey!"
Steven says: "Hi, I'm Steven."
Steven says: "What brings you back to Earth?"
Uh... *sits up* I... don't... know? *shrugs*.
Steven says: "Oh, uh, I understand."
Steven says: "I used to forget why we go on missions all the time."
I'll just go stand over here then. *walks over to stand by the fence*.
Steven says: "Let's take a chance on "Army"."
Steven says: "Good afternoon!"
Garnet says: "*picks "Army" up by the back of her tunic* Hey!"
Garnet says: "Don't be like that."
Why I oughta razzle-frazzle your- *flails about while mumbling angrily*.
Garnet says: "Aww."
Hey, what the- *flails her legs and continues mumbling angrily*.
Garnet says: "Next!"
Steven says: "Ehh..."
Steven says: ""Navy"?"
If I remember correctly, we were on Earth- *pauses and sees the Gems staring at her, causing her to blush and look away* Uh... hah! This is so embarrassing! *covers her face* Oh-ho- *looks back at the Gems* Aah! *runs away and cowers next to "Leggy"*.
Steven says: "Okay, "Eyeball"?"
I'm not tellin' y'all nothin' about nothin'! *crosses her arms and growls*.
Steven says: "The only one left now is, uh..."
Steven says: ""Doc"."
Lastly, "Doc" is released.
Where's Jasper? Last time we came says: "*air-quotes* "She's on Neptune", so we looked, and she wasn't there."
you tricked us into playing that stuuupid game! Then says: "*air-quotes* "She's on Neptune", so we looked, and she wasn't there."
you said says: "*air-quotes* "She's on Neptune", so we looked, and she wasn't there."
Where's Jasper? Last time we came says: "She wasn't on Neptune!"
you tricked us into playing that stuuupid game! Then says: "She wasn't on Neptune!"
you said says: "She wasn't on Neptune!"
Where's Jasper? Last time we came says: "Or any other planet in this whole dang solar system!"
you tricked us into playing that stuuupid game! Then says: "Or any other planet in this whole dang solar system!"
you said says: "Or any other planet in this whole dang solar system!"
Amethyst walks past behind the Gems in the background, pondering to herself.
Tell us where she is right now. No games, no tricks, and no slick disguises.
Homeworld Rubies says: "Yeah!"
Amethyst says: "HEY!"
The Rubies turn to look in Amethyst's direction, who has shapeshifted herself to look like Jasper.
Amethyst Jasper.
The Crystal Gems stare at Amethyst in perplexity.
Pearl says: "Is she serious?"
Look, it's Jasper!
The Homeworld Rubies all cheer and mumble excitedly. "Eyeball" pushes through the other Homeworld Rubies and approaches Amethyst.
Jasper! I'm Ruby 1F4 Cut 4ND. I fought in the war for Earth. *does the Gem salute*.
Amethyst Jasper.
Uh... At ease.
I was on the ground in Facet 6 when I heard the tale of the Facet 9 Kindergarten Quartz that could. They said you popped out of the ground with your helmet on, and took out 80 Crystal Gems before the sun went down. When I found out this mission was to look for you, I nearly dissipated my form! It is... an honor to finally meet you.
Amethyst Jasper.
Yep! That's me! Always huge, never small, all the- all the time since I was made! *smiles nervously*.
Wait a minute! *gets suspicious* You look different than I thought you would.
Pearl says: "Oh, here it is."
Amethyst Jasper.
Oh, you must mean my tan! You know, from the sun! *points to the Sun*.
Stupid Earth sun! *kicks up a clod of dirt* I hate this planet!
Amethyst Jasper.
Curse this planet! *kicks up more dirt and strikes a pose*.
The Homeworld Rubies run in cheering and begin to kick up chunks of dirt as well. The Crystal Gems continue to star in perplexity as Pearl facepalms in disbelief.
Well, it's a good thing we finally found you. Yellow Diamond is awaiting your return. We'll take you back to Homeworld right away.
Amethyst Jasper.
What?
Why?
Yeah, why, Jasper?
Amethyst Jasper.
Because... I gotta stay here! With these guys! *walks next to the Crystal Gems* Yup, gotta keep 'em prisoner. Lapis rolls her eyes. For the Diamonds.
Jasper...
Such devotion.
The Homeworld Rubies chatter among themselves, wondering where the nearest Diamond base is.
Where's that?
Think we passed it on the way here?
You dummies! It's uh, it's... hm.
Argh! It's there!
Amethyst says: "*shocked, normal voice* I gotta hold this all the way to the moon?!"
Amethyst says: "!"
Amethyst says: "*Jasper's voice* Uh..."
Amethyst says: "Hold this..."
Amethyst says: "hold these..."
Amethyst says: "prisoners!"
Amethyst says: "*points at Crystal Gems* I gotta bring these rebel prisoners if we're going to the moon!"
Amethyst says: "Can't leave them here unsupervised."
Very well, to the ship!
The Homeworld Rubies begin marching into the Roaming Eye. The Crystal Gems begin to chide Amethyst.
Pearl says: "What are you doing?"
Pearl says: "This isn't going to work!"
Garnet says: "You can't hold that form forever."
Amethyst Jasper.
Amethyst lightly shoves the Crystal Gems forward, and they walk towards the ship too. Amethyst then turns to Peridot and Lapis.
Amethyst Jasper.
Lapis says: "Not really."
Amethyst says: "Alright!"
Amethyst says: "Just checking."
Trans. Int. Roaming Eye.
The Homeworld Rubies march towards the ship control panels as the Crystal Gems enter the ship.
Homeworld Rubies says: "Hup!"
Homeworld Rubies says: "Hup!"
Homeworld Rubies says: "Hup!"
Homeworld Rubies says: "Hup!"
Homeworld Rubies says: "Hup!"
Homeworld Rubies says: "Hup!"
Homeworld Rubies says: "Hup!"
Steven says: "Woah, it's huge in here!"
Steven says: "I thought it'd be super cramped."
Hey! This ain't no pleasure cruise!
Amethyst Jasper.
Yeah! Show some respect, you... Crystal Germs!
Yeah, you tell 'em Jasper.
I bet they got those germs from Earth!
The Crystal Gems decide to play along with Amethyst's act.
Garnet says: "Aw, curses!"
Garnet says: "I can't believe we've been caught, and by none other than Jasper!"
Garnet says: "So cross over it."
Steven says: "Uh huh, that sure is Jasper!"
Steven says: "The one that caught us."
Steven says: "Harumph."
Pearl says: "*prances and points at Amethyst dramatically* Of all the indignities!"
Pearl says: "Do what you want!"
Pearl says: "I'll never talk!"
Amethyst Jasper.
Heh. I wish.
Yeah, haha! She talks a lot!
Amethyst Jasper.
Go sit over there now!
I was just thinking that!
Amethyst Jasper.
Amethyst Jasper.
Ah! I'm Jasper!
Please feel free to take my seat right up front. The captain's seat. *points towards the seat* It would be an honor.
Amethyst Jasper.
Yeah. Yes. Sure thing.
Amethyst walks over and sits in the captain's seat.
Ruby "Doc".
I hope it's to your liking.
Amethyst Jasper.
It's alright.
You can go ahead and head towards the moon base whenever you're ready.
Amethyst Jasper.
Uhhh... Of course! Heh.
Amethyst looks at the controls in confusion. She turns to glance at the Crystal Gems, as Steven groans nervously.
Amethyst Jasper.
Uh, listen. *lifts "Doc" up and sits her on her laps* I'm Jasper, and I'm too worn out from catching rebels to fly, so I'll just sit here like this and you work the thing to get us to the moon. Got it?
Yes. Of course.
To the moon, then?
Amethyst Jasper.
To the moon, then!
Homeworld Rubies says: "To the moon, then!"
The Roaming Eye starts up and begin flying towards the moon.
We'll be arriving shortly.
Amethyst Jasper.
Yes, Jasper. Good idea.
Amethyst gets off the seat, sits "Doc" in it, and walks towards the Crystal Gems.
Pearl says: "NOOOOOO!"
Pearl says: "Stay away from us, you brute!"
Amethyst Jasper.
The Crystal Gems glances at "Army", who is looking at Pearl menacingly and punching her palm.
Pearl says: "Sorry."
Pearl says: "Got a bit carried away."
Steven says: "Uh, you okay, Amethyst?"
Steven says: "You've been holding that form forever now."
Amethyst Jasper.
Trans. Int. Moon Base.
The Roaming Eye eventually arrive at the Moon Base, enters it, and smoothly hovers onto the moon base's ground floor. "Doc" uses her gem to shine light like a flashlight and the Homeworld Rubies begin to step out of the ship.
All clear!
Right this way, Jasper.
Pearl says: "*dramatically* Oh, Jasper, won't you ever let us go?"
Steven exits the ship and begins to float around in excitement, but Garnet quickly grabs him and holds his hand. "Eyeball" shines her gem too and starts looking around the dark Moon Base.
Look at this place, frozen in time. An Era-1 base. Her Era-1 base. *shines her light at a mural of an unknown Diamond* It was a tragedy, what happened to her.
Who is that anyway?
Were you made yesterday?! That, is Pink Diamond. Jasper, maybe it's best if you explain.
Amethyst Jasper.
I understand. She was your original Diamond.
The group begin to climb the staircase to the top control room, as "Eyeball" tells the tale about Pink Diamond's demise.
Earth was Pink Diamond's colony. Everything was going smoothly at first. Kindergartens were incubating their first soldiers. Big, warm pieces of Quartz, like this mountain over here- *looks at Amethyst* -were being created from its rich minerals with great success. Then BAM! One of Pink Diamond's very own Quartz soldiers started a rebellion and took it too far. *turns towards Amethyst* Where were you when it happened?
Amethyst Jasper.
Oh, you know, around?
I was there. I saw it with my own eye. I watched the leader of the Crystal Gems, Rose Quartz, shatter Pink Diamond!
Everyone freezes as "Eyeball" reveals the stunning fact. Steven glares in disbelief at Garnet and Pearl, who is shivering violently and covering her mouth.
Steven says: "No!"
Steven says: "Rose Quartz would never do that!"
Steven says: "*tears up* A-And, sure, she had to fight but- but she would never shatter someone!"
Amethyst and the Homeworld Rubies turn to look at Steven.
Hey! We got a problem.
Trans Int. Moon Base Control Room.
The Homeworld Rubies gather to inspect the broken control panel.
The panel is broken. The communicator is gone! There's no way to contact Yellow Diamond from this hub.
Amethyst walks in, sweating excessively from trying to keep her form as Jasper.
Crystal Geeems!
Other Rubies says: "Unbelievable!"
Other Rubies says: "Rude!"
Other Rubies says: "No respect!"
Amethyst shapeshifts back to her normal form to catch a breather.
See? They'll stoop to anything!
Amethyst quickly shapeshifts back into Jasper as "Doc" turns towards her.
We'll have to take you to Homeworld to file a report in person.
Amethyst Jasper.
Homeworld Rubies says: "Huh?"
Homeworld Rubies says: "I don't understand."
Homeworld Rubies says: "What do you mean?"
Homeworld Rubies says: "What's going on?"
Amethyst Jasper.
You know what? *pats "Eyeball"'s head* You know me. Do me a favor and go back home and file the report for me.  I'm trusting you, soldier.
Wow. *excitedly* Of course!
That settles it. All right, Rubies, back to the ship!
As "Doc" speaks, Amethyst gives Pearl a smug look. Pearl then facepalms in exasperation.
Trans Int. Moon Base Ground Floor.
Steven says: "All right, Amethyst!"
Garnet says: "You really held it together."
Pearl says: "You did it!"
Pearl says: "I told you you could."
Amethyst says: "*high-fives Pearl and Steven and chuckles* Aww."
Steven walks over to look at the mural of Pink Diamond portrait, when the door of the Roaming Eye opens again.
Hey, you need a ride back to Earth? I could sit on your lap if you want- *sees Amethyst in her default form* What?!
Amethyst says: "*yelling hurriedly* I'm still Jasper!"
We've been tricked? Again?!
Other Rubies says: "No way!"
Rubies, assemble!
Homeworld Rubies says: "Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup!"
Homeworld Rubies says: "Yeah!"
The Homeworld Rubies jump onto one another and begin to fuse into a single giant Ruby.
"Giant" Ruby says: "Yeah!"
"Giant" Ruby says: "We won't let you trick us again!"
Steven says: "Hey, Rubies!"
Steven says: "*stands next to the Moon Base door* If you're gonna fight, take it outside!"
Steven activates the door switch, opening the door and the giant Ruby gets sucked halfway out the door.
"Giant" Ruby says: "You can't get rid of us that easy!"
Pearl and Garnet fuse into Sardonyx, with Amethyst on her shoulder.
Steven says: "I bet she can."
Sardonyx takes out her hammer and slams it into the giant Ruby.
"Giant" Ruby says: "Oof!"
The giant Ruby unfuses back into the Rubies and are sucked out the door into space. As "Eyeball" is sucked out the door, she grabs Steven and pulls him out with her. Steven screams as he too gets sucked into space.
Amethyst says: "STEEEVEEEN!!"
As Steven floats further away from the Base, Amethyst's scream fades while Sardonyx looks on helplessly.
END.
