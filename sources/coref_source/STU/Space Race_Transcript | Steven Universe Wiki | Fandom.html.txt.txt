Open Int. Galaxy Warp.
The Crystal Gems arrive on a Warp Pad, leading a series of other Warp Pads.
Steven says: "Woah."
Garnet says: "*steps on a Warp Pad* Inactive."
Steven proceeds to paste a sticker of a crying apple on the Warp Pad.
Amethyst says: "*jumps onto another Warp Pad* Inactive!"
Steven runs over and paste another sticker on the Warp Pad, this time of a crying crossiant.
Pearl says: "*standing on another Warp Pad in disappointment* Inactive."
Steven pastes another sticker of a crying pear on the Warp Pad.
Amethyst says: "Do we have to check all of them?"
Amethyst says: "They're all still inactive, like always."
Garnet says: "We need to make sure."
Steven says: "I've never seen so many Warp Pads before!"
Steven says: "*gets two stickers* I hope I have enough of these Crying Breakfast Friends stickers."
Steven says: "Where do all these Warp Pads go, anyway?"
Pearl says: "*sits on the Warp Pad she was standing on* Well, Steven, these Warp Pads were used to travel off-planet."
Pearl says: "They were our connection to the Gem Homeworld and to Gem-controlled planets all over the universe."
Steven says: "*gasps* You mean we could go anywhere we want in outer space?"
Amethyst says: "Yeah..."
Amethyst says: "We could do that if they weren't all busted."
Pearl says: "It's true."
Pearl says: "The Galaxy Warp have all been inactive for thousands of years."
Steven says: "Can't we fix them?"
Garnet says: "..."
Garnet says: "No."
Pearl says: "It's fine."
Pearl says: "*chuckles* I'll always have my memories of other worlds."
Pearl says: "But now I'm here."
Pearl says: "On Earth."
Pearl says: "Forever."
Steven says: "With me!"
Pearl says: "Right, with you."
Pearl says: "*walks up to a broken Warp Pad* It really is incredible out there, though."
Pearl says: "I wish you could see it, Steven."
Steven, seeing that the Warp Pad is visibly broken, pastes asticker of a crying waffle on it.
Trans. Ext. It's A Wash.
Greg and Steven are watching 'Crying Breakfast Friends!' outside. On-screen, various breakfast-themed characters are crying, such as Crying Waffle, Crying Pear, Sad Apple and Spilled Milk.
TV Narrator says: "Stay tuned for another episode of Crying Breakfast Friends!"
Greg says: "Yeesh."
Greg says: "I must be getting old."
Greg says: "I used to like cartoons."
Steven says: "Hey, Dad, did you know the Gems used to travel all over outer space?"
Greg says: "*chuckles* Yeah."
Greg says: "They're pretty far out, son."
Steven says: "I think Pearl really misses going out there."
Steven says: "*sees a comet print on Greg's Van* Dad, can you help me build a spaceship?"
Greg says: "..."
Greg says: "You know, that might be a little outside my skill set."
Greg says: "How 'bout a bunk bed with wings?"
Greg says: "I could probably do that."
Steven says: "No way!"
Steven says: "We could totally build a spaceship!"
Steven says: "*stands up on a chair* People have done it before, and we're people!"
Greg says: "We are people."
Steven says: "And Pearl would love it so much to see space again."
Greg says: "..."
Greg says: "Sure."
Greg says: "Why not?"
Greg says: "How hurt could we get?"
Trans. Ext. the Barn.
Greg brings Steven to a barn full with various junk.
Greg says: "My aunt and uncle had a great love for aviation and each other."
Greg says: "They cherished the years they spent together, and they held on to every belonging they ever owned, kind of like me and my storage shed."
Greg says: "I'm starting to think our family has a problem."
Steven says: "This is great!"
Steven says: "I hereby declare this barn to be Universe & Universe's Universal Space Travel HQ!"
Steven and Greg begin to draw on a chalkboard and begin to build a spaceship using wood and duct tape. Steven then bring Pearl, covering her eyes, to the barn as a surprise.
Steven says: "Okay, now."
Pearl says: "*reads a sign on the barn* "UUU Space Travel"?"
Pearl says: "What is this?"
Steven says: "We built a spaceship!"
Pearl says: "A spaceship?"
Steven says: "A spaceship!"
Pearl says: "*raises an eyebrow* A spaceship."
Steven gets in the "spaceship", as he prepares to pilot it down the hill by the barn.
Greg says: "Now, remember, Steven, if you run into any trouble out there, you can always bail."
Greg says: "There's never any shame in bailing."
Steven says: "Fatherly advice understood!"
Steven says: "Thank you, Dad."
Steven says: "Light the engines."
Greg says: "Roger that!"
Steven says: "Next stop: Outer space!"
Greg says: "Blast-off!"
Greg pushes the "spaceship" with his legs and Steven rides down the hill. He begins riding towards a ramp at the bottom of the hill, when the "spaceship" starts falling apart.
Pearl says: "*panics* Aah!"
Steven says: "No shame!"
The "spaceship" rams into the ramp and breaks into pieces.
Pearl says: "I think your calculations may have been off."
Greg says: "Well, they can't be off if you don't do any."
Trans. Ext. the Barn.
Pearl says: "*points at Steven's drawing on the chalkboard* Did you really think this was gonna work?"
Steven says: "*shrugs* Mnh-mnh-mnh."
Greg says: "*shrugs* Mnh-mnh-mnh."
Pearl says: "Here, look."
Pearl says: "*flips the other side of the chalkboard and starts drawing* You need smooth, curving surfaces."
Pearl says: "Otherwise, you're never gonna get enough speed to break Earth's gravitational pull."
Pearl says: "Probably swept-back wings for supersonic flight, airtight cockpit with ejector seat, and we'll need some serious engines, or maybe rockets would be better."
Steven says: "I vote rockets!"
Greg says: "Whoa, whoa."
Greg says: "Hold on a sec."
Greg says: "We're not actually talking about building something like this, right?"
Pearl says: "What?"
Pearl says: "This?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Pearl says: "*reveals a detailed diagram of an actual spaceship on the chalkboard* Of course not."
Pearl says: "That would be ridiculous."
Pearl says: "I mean, yes, theoretically, it's not a stretch."
Pearl says: "You've got plenty of spare parts here, albeit for incredibly primitive propulsion-based space travel."
Pearl says: "The idea is ludicrous."
Pearl says: "It would never work, although..."
Pearl says: "Several humans, a monkey, and a dog did make it into space."
Pearl says: "I don't know why I've never even thought of it before."
Pearl says: "This could actually work!"
Steven says: "Uh..."
Greg says: "Uh..."
Pearl says: "I hear what you're saying, and I agree—"
Pearl says: "it would be incredibly dangerous; a fool's errand."
Pearl pulls a lob of stuffing out of Greg's love seat.
Pearl says: "This chair is disgusting."
Pearl says: "But aren't the true fools the ones who don't seize an opportunity, despite all the inherent risks?"
Pearl says: "*hands Greg the lob of stuffing* And I'd be able to show Steven the wonders of the cosmos!"
Pearl says: "And maybe just for a second, from a distance, I could see what's been going on without me."
Pearl says: "All right!"
Pearl says: "Let's do it!"
Steven says: "UUU Space Travel, GOOOOO!"
Steven and Greg begin helping Pearl to construct the spaceship with various spare parts from the barn. They even constructed a small seated glider for Steven to ride in.
Steven says: "*piloting the glider* Waaa-hooooo!"
Greg says: "*using a walkie-talkie* Ground Control to Mach 2."
Greg says: "Come in, Mach 2."
Greg says: "How you doing, buddy?"
Steven says: "Aah!"
Steven says: "Aah-aah-aah-aah!"
Steven says: "Woow!"
Greg says: "You think we're taking this a little far?"
Pearl says: "We're not even close to being done."
Greg says: "We're not?"
Pearl says: "Okay, Steven."
Pearl says: "Go ahead and bring her down."
Steven lands the Mach 2 smoothly on the ground, and it collapses immediately, ejecting Steven out of the seat.
Steven says: "Ugh!"
Steven says: "Wooo!"
Greg says: "Was it supposed to fall apart like that?"
Pearl says: "Don't worry."
Pearl says: "This was just to test my engine concept."
Pearl says: "I'll work out the kinks in the next one."
Greg says: "Hang on."
Greg says: "Hang on."
Greg says: "Next one?!"
Greg says: "!"
Pearl says: "Is there a shop in town that carries F-1 single-nozzle liquid-fueled rockets?"
Greg says: "*startled and shocked* You really are serious!"
Pearl says: "Of course!"
Pearl says: "We're also going to need a space suit for Steven so he doesn't freeze or explode."
Greg says: "Whoa."
Greg says: "You are not taking him to space."
Pearl says: "Yes, I am."
Greg says: "No!"
Greg says: "I'm not allowing it!"
Steven says: "But why?"
Steven says: "This is why we founded Universe & Universe."
Greg says: "Steven, you're grounded."
Steven says: "What?!"
Steven says: "!"
Greg says: "No, no."
Greg says: "I mean you're grounded."
Greg says: "You don't get to leave Earth."
Steven says: "Oh."
Steven says: "What?!"
Steven says: "!"
Greg says: "As C."
Greg says: "E."
Greg says: "O."
Greg says: "and Supreme Space Commander, I hereby ground this astronaut and cancel this mission."
Steven says: "Aw, man!"
Steven says: "Stupid company by-laws."
Pearl says: "Hey!"
Pearl says: "Who made you C."
Pearl says: "E."
Pearl says: "O."
Pearl says: "!"
Pearl says: "?"
Greg says: "*tilts head towards Steven* He did."
Pearl says: "Fine."
Pearl says: "If neither of you will help, I'll just do it by myself—"
Pearl says: "Not like it'll be much different."
Steven says: "Pearl!"
Greg says: "I'm sorry, bud."
Greg says: "Sometimes you just got to know when to bail."
Time Skip — Night time.
Greg is fast asleep in his van, parked next to the barn. Steven sleeps on top of the van in his caterpillar sleeping bag, when Pearl comes in and pokes him in the face.
Steven says: "M-mm..."
Steven says: "Wha?"
Pearl says: "Shh!"
Pearl says: "*whispering* Want to see something really cool?"
Greg says: "*snoring and sleep-talking* No."
Greg says: "Don't give him the banana."
Greg says: "That's what he wants."
Pearl and Steven sneak past Greg and towards the barn. Pearl opens the barn door to reveal a completed spaceship.
Pearl says: "Presenting the brand-new ballistic-flight-capable Universe Mach 3!"
Steven says: "*gasps and shouts* Spaceship!"
Pearl says: "Wait, Steven."
Pearl says: "Keep your voice down."
Steven says: "*grunts* *laughs* Whoa!"
Steven says: "It's even got the logo from the van!"
Pearl says: "And if your dad asks, we'll say we borrowed it."
Steven says: "*climbs into the cockpit of Mach 3* Whoa."
Steven says: "Look at all the buttons!"
Steven says: "I must press them all."
Pearl says: "If you want, Steven, we could take her out for an engine check."
Pearl says: "*changes her outfit into a space suit* It'll be quick."
The place begins to rumble, waking Greg up.
Greg says: "Wha?!"
Greg says: "!"
Greg says: "What the..."
Greg says: "?"
Greg says: "*notices his van has been tampered with* Pearl!"
Greg says: "*runs up and sees Steven and Pearl piloting the Mach 3 away* Steven, what are you doing?!"
Greg says: "!"
Greg chases after the Mach 3, when the rockets fire up, creating a blast that knocks Greg back. Greg quickly gets up and runs towards the barn. Pearl begins to gliding the Mach 3 over the ocean.
Steven says: "*laughs* Wow!"
Steven says: "Look!"
Steven says: "You can see the temple!"
Pearl says: "*adjusts the ship controls* Mm-hmm."
Greg says: "*over the radio transmission* Hey, can you hear me!"
Greg says: "?"
Greg says: "Where do you two think you're going!"
Greg says: "?"
Steven says: "Hey, Dad, guess where I am."
Greg says: "*using a walkie-talkie* I know where you are!"
Greg says: "It's where you're going that concerns me!"
Steven says: "Don't worry, Dad."
Steven says: "This is just a quick test flight."
Pearl says: "This will be perfectly fine, just a pop over to the nearest star system."
Pearl says: "I'll give him back in 50 years."
Steven says: "50 years?"
Greg says: "What?!"
Greg says: "!"
Greg says: "I'll be dead in 50 years!"
Greg says: "Pearl, you bring him back right now, or I'll --  Hello?"
Greg says: "Hello?!"
Greg says: "!"
Steven says: "Pearl, I'm not supposed to go."
Steven says: "Pearl!"
Pearl says: "Oh, this is so exciting!"
Pearl says: "Steven, you're gonna love it."
Pearl says: "*plays a keyboard panel, activating the boosters* Hang on tight!"
The Mach 3 darts across the ocean and then upwards into the sky. Pearl and Steven pilot all the way to the atmosphere of the Earth, when Steven see a piece of scrap metal flies by.
Steven says: "What was that?"
The warning lights in the cockpit begin to flash on. More scrap metal pieces are seen falling off the Mach 3 as it penetrates the atmosphere.
Steven says: "Pearl!"
Steven says: "?"
Pearl says: "We can make it."
Pearl says: "We're almost there."
The Mach 3 begins to fall apart with visible tears in its shell.
Steven says: "Pearl!"
Pearl says: "I'm gonna show it to you."
Steven looks around in panic and see a release mechanism. He pulls on it and it releases the glass hatch covering the cockpit, exposing him and Pearl to the atmosphere.
Pearl says: "Steven!"
Pearl says: "What are you doing?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Steven says: "We need to go, Pearl!"
Steven says: "We're not gonna make it!"
Pearl says: "But we're almost there!"
Steven says: "Pearl!"
Steven says: "I know you miss space, and I know you worked hard, but sometimes..."
Steven says: "You just got to know when to bail."
Pearl sheds a tear as she gazes up to space. She then pulls a lever on the side of the chair she is sitting on and hugs Steven tightly. The chair ejects both of them out of the spaceship just as it explodes.
Greg says: "Nooooo!"
Greg says: "*scans the sky with his binoculars* Please-please-please-please-please!"
Greg says: "*sees the ejected Pearl and Steven, floating back to Earth with a parachute* Ahhhh..."
Greg says: "*kneels on the ground* Ohhhhh..."
Greg says: "*holds his chest* Ohh, this kid's killing me..."
Greg says: "*lays down and cowers* Ughhhh..."
Pearl says: "*floating back to Earth with Steven* I'm so sorry."
Pearl says: "I almost got us killed."
Steven says: "I'm used to it."
Steven says: "I'm sorry I couldn't help you go to space."
Steven says: "We'll get there someday—"
Steven says: "I promise."
Pearl says: "You know, I think I'd rather be here on Earth."
Steven says: "With me!"
Pearl says: "Yeah."
Pearl says: "With you."
The star iris zooms in on the distant sunset, ending the episode.
END.
