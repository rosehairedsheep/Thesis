Steven is sitting on the beach, eyes closed and taking deep breaths.
Steven says: "*deep inhale* Shield."
Steven's gem begins to glow. He slowly opens his eyes and finds him encased in his bubble shield.
Steven says: "No!"
Steven says: "Not bubble shield!"
Steven dispels his bubble and throws a little tantrum.
Steven says: "*looks at his gem* What am I doing wrong?"
Steven says: "The Gems can all summon their weapons, why can't I?"
Steven says: "*gets desperate* Isn't there somebody who can help me?"
The area starts to rumble.
Steven says: "Wha..."
Steven says: "?"
Steven gets and sees dolphins circling around in the sea, creating a whirlpool. A giant shell then emerges from the vortex, atop a water sprout.
Steven says: "Wha!"
Steven says: "?"
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "Huh?!"
Steven says: "!"
Crabs start rushing past Steven into the ocean, startling him. The dolphins starts spitting water like fountains and the shell opens up in a glorious entrance before Steven, revealing to be... Uncle Grandpa, dressed up like Rose Quartz.
Uncle Grandpa says: "Good morning!"
Steven says: "Whoa!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "*suddenly appears beside Steven, buried as a sand mermaid* Bravo!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "*applauds* This guy sure knows how to make an entrance."
Uncle Grandpa says: "What do you think Mr."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Dolphin?"
Mr. Dolphin squeaks besides Uncle Grandpa. Uncle Grandpa gets up and starts dusting sand off him, rotating his torso 360Â° around.
Steven says: "Oh my gosh!"
Steven says: "Uncle Grandpa!"
Steven says: "You're really here, I can't believe it!"
Steven says: "I mean, I LITERALLY can't believe it."
Steven says: "*excitedly* How is this even possible?!"
Steven says: "!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "*pulls Steven in* Don't worry, bro."
Uncle Grandpa says: "*speaks to the audience* None of this is canon."
Uncle Grandpa says: "But this is!"
Uncle Grandpa pulls a giant cannon from Belly Bag and puts his head into it. He then fires his head into the air, spelling "April Fools" in smoke, and crashes into a ship. Lars and Sadie climbs onto the tip as the ship sinks.
Lars says: "Oh no-ho-ho-ho!"
Lars says: "OUR SHIIIIIP!"
Sadie holds on to Lars dramatically as the ship sinks with them.
Uncle Grandpa says: "Sooooo, I hear your belly's being a bit of a bummer."
Steven says: "Yeah."
Steven says: "*lifts his shirt* I've been trying to pull my shield outta my gem all morning."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Hmmm..."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Well let's take a look-see..."
Uncle Grandpa says: "*clones his head from Belly Bag and gives Steven a check-up* You should make sure to get this thing polished at least twice a year."
Steven says: "So..."
Steven says: "do you think you can help me?"
Steven says: "At least I totally wanna protect my friends."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Hmm..."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Yup, it's the belly blues."
Uncle Grandpa says: "I've definitely seen this before."
Steven says: "Really?!"
Steven says: "!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "I was there!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "- Don't you remember?"
Uncle Grandpa replays the episode of "Gem Glow", as he tries to communicate with Steven via his own in-show commercial.
Uncle Grandpa says: "Uh whoa!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Hey!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "It's a brand new cartoon picture show!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Hey!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Hey!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Hi there!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Hello?"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Hey!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Good morning?"
Steven says: "I don't remember that at all."
Uncle Grandpa says: "So your shield only comes out when you need to protect yourself."
Steven says: "Yeah?"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Well then, you just need something to protect yourself FROM!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Like this cool mega super awesome rocket launcher!"
Steven says: "Uh..."
Steven says: "Uncle Grandpa?"
Steven says: "*gets worried* This doesn't seem safe..."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Don't worry kid, I'm wearing a helmet."
Uncle Grandpa fires a rocket at Steven, who holds up his hands in panic. The tiny rocket hits Steven in the forehead with no impact at all, lands on the sand and explodes harmlessly.
Uncle Grandpa says: "*floats in* Anything?"
Steven says: "No..."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Then how about a BEE-ZOOKA?"
Steven runs away screaming, with giant bees chasing him.
Uncle Grandpa says: "Or a Snake Shooter?"
Steven runs away cautiously, with a snake slittering towards him.
Uncle Grandpa says: "Or the BEE-ZOOKA again?"
Steven runs away screaming again. Uncle Grandpa ponders as Steven, visibly stung and swollen, sits besides.
Uncle Grandpa says: "Hmm..."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Still nothin'."
Uncle Grandpa says: "*snaps his finger* Oh, I know!"
Pearl then pops out from inside the Beach House as Amethyst watches the commotion from the porch.
Pearl says: "Amethyst, have you seen Steven this morning?"
Amethyst says: "Yeap."
Amethyst says: "He's hanging out with some weirdo."
Amethyst says: "*points to Uncle Grandpa* I think he's trying to vaporize Steven."
Pearl says: "Whagahaha?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Pearl freaks out as she sees Uncle Grandpa aiming a giant death ray at Steven.
Pearl says: "STEVEN!!!!!"
Everyone brace themselves as the death ray is fired, and Steven appears unharmed in his bubble shield.
Steven says: "NOOOO!"
Steven says: "Not bubble shield!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Hmmm..."
Uncle Grandpa says: "I would've sworn the Doomtastic Death Ray of Dastardly Destruction would've worked, You wanna try the bees again?"
Gems says: "*jumps in* Steven!"
Pearl says: "What's going on?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Pearl says: "Who is this..."
Pearl says: "stranger?"
Steven says: "He's not a stranger, he's Uncle Grandpa!"
Uncle Grandpa honks his nose twice.
Amethyst says: "Uncle..."
Amethyst says: "Grandpa?"
Pearl says: "So that would make him Greg's brother..."
Pearl says: "and father?"
Garnet says: "That would explain..."
Garnet says: "a LOT."
Belly Bag says: "Thaaat's right!"
Belly Bag says: "He's not just your Uncle Grandpa, Steven!"
Belly Bag says: "He's everyone in the world's Uncle Grandpa!"
Belly Bag says: "And when he comes to town, you're sure to have a fun time!"
Steven's and the Gems' heads follow Uncle Grandpa's head too, as they start circling around the Earth.
Steven says: "Ahahaha, we're in space!"
The Gems' head return back to their bodies, and they are visibly frightened.
Pearl says: "*freaking out* O-o-oh, Gimminee..."
Pearl says: ".."
Pearl says: "!"
Pearl says: "*feels Garnet's head* Yahuhuhahahehehetseyahutsui, Ahu- Aaaw..."
Amethyst says: "Augh!"
Amethyst says: "My head is on BACKWAAAAARDS!"
Garnet says: "*shivers* Woohoohaha..."
Uncle Grandpa's and Steven's heads return back to their heads too, and they calmly fist-bumps each other.
Garnet says: "Gem huddle!"
Pearl says: "Obviously, we're dealing with some super-powerful reality-warping entity."
Garnet says: "He could be a danger to the fabric of space itself!"
Amethyst says: "I dunno guys!"
Amethyst says: "Hah, I kinda like 'im!"
Steven says: "Hey!"
Steven says: "*huddles in* What are you guys talkin' about?"
Uncle Grandpa says: "*butts in too* Are you forming a secret club?"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Can we join too?"
Gems says: "AUGH!"
Pearl says: "Eh-hem, Umm..."
Pearl says: "Uncle Grandpa?"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Good morning."
Uncle Grandpa says: "*playing video games with Steven* Play video games?"
Pearl says: "No."
Uncle Grandpa says: "*running around Steven* Run around in circles?"
Pearl says: "*starting to get annoyed* Noo."
Uncle Grandpa says: "*eating a three way sub with Amethyst and Steven* Eat a three way sub?"
Amethyst says: "Yo."
Pearl says: "*gets mad at Amethyst with crazed eyes* AMETHYST!!!!!!"
Garnet says: "-that you are a danger to Steven and the planet Earth, and we MUST destroy you!"
Steven says: "What?!"
Steven says: "!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "*worried* Bad morning!"
Steven says: "Wait, no!"
Steven says: "You guys, don't hurt him!"
The Gems summon their weapons as a title card that says "CRYSTAL GEMS" appear before them. Another title card saying "RUN AWAY" appears before Uncle Grandpa and Steven, and they start to run.
Uncle Grandpa says: "Come on, kid!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Let's gooo!"
Amethyst says: "*trips over the "y" on the "Run Away" title card* WHYYYYYY!"
Amethyst says: "?!"
Amethyst says: "!"
Amethyst says: "?"
Steven says: "I'm sorry, they're not usually like this!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Quick!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Belly Bag, we need a plot hole!"
Belly Bag says: "Sure thing, Uncle Grandpa!"
Belly Bag says: "OOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"
Belly Bag releases a white card from it and expands it big enough to cover the screen. Steven and Uncle Grandpa then runs into a blank white space.
Steven says: "Where are we?"
The screen goes black, and then Hot Dog Person is seen in space yelling Uncle Grandpa's theme song. Uncle Grandpa's head is seen over Earth greeting "Good Morning!"... as he and Steven enter his dimension.
Uncle Grandpa says: "*laughing and driving* Now where did I put that little kid?"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Oh yeah!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "*opens a cubby, revealing Steven inside* Good morning!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Oh, lemme give you a hand there."
Steven says: "*fastened to the seat belt* Wow, where am I?"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Welcome to the "U."
Uncle Grandpa says: "G."
Uncle Grandpa says: "R."
Uncle Grandpa says: "V."
Steven says: "The..."
Steven says: "wha?"
Uncle Grandpa says: "The "Uncle Grandpa Recreational Vehicle"."
Steven says: "Oh, cool!"
Steven says: "My dad lives in a van too!"
Steven says: "Did you used to be a rockstar?"
Uncle Grandpa says: "I'm still a rockstar, kid."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Hey Steven!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "I'll give ya the tour!"
Steven says: "Wow, it's huge!"
Steven says: "*looks around the U."
Steven says: "G."
Steven says: "R."
Steven says: "V."
Steven says: "* You can fit a million vans in here!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Actually, it's more like 40 or 50 vans, see?"
Pizza Steve then appears, riding on a motorcycle through an obstacle course, crashing into the van pile in front of Steven and Uncle Grandpa, and throwing his motorcycle away, causing it to explode, and reveals it is all in his imagination.
Pizza Steve says: "Oh, hey!"
Pizza Steve says: "It's just me, PIZZA STEVE, just the coolest and tastiest Steve, who ever lived."
Steven says: "Hi Pizza Steve, I'm a Steve too!"
Steven says: "Steven Universe."
Pizza Steve says: "Stee-ven..."
Pizza Steve says: "Universe?"
Pizza Steve says: "*appears on Steven's head* Come on Uncle G, I've got two rules!"
Pizza Steve says: "No more than 40 or 50 vans, and only ONE Steve allowed."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Yeah, but THIS Steven is special."
Mr. Gus says: "Yeah, he's a Crystal Gem."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Good mornin' Mr."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Gus."
Mr. Gus says: "What's up, Uncle Grandpa?"
Steven says: "Wow, Mr."
Steven says: "Gus!"
Steven says: "How do you know about me?"
Mr. Gus says: "I have a comprehensive knowledge of all magical denizens of the multiverse."
Mr. Gus says: "I know ALL about the Crystal Gems!"
Mr. Gus says: "Come here man, check this out."
Mr. Gus says: "*shows Steven a drawing on his computer* I even made my OWN gemsona."
Mr. Gus says: "My gem is on my tail, and my weapon is a frying pan."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Nice linework, Mr."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Gus."
Steven says: "That's really cool, Mr."
Steven says: "Gus!"
Steven says: "I wish I was as cool as your drawing."
Mr. Gus says: "Something wrong?"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Steven doesn't know how to summon his shield."
Mr. Gus says: "You don't say?"
Mr. Gus says: "Ah, that's simple."
Mr. Gus says: "Steven's powers are maternal."
Mr. Gus says: "Control of his gem is based on emotional clarity."
Pizza Steve says: "*interrupts* Hey, Mr."
Pizza Steve says: "Gus,I fixed your drawing."
Mr. Gus says: "HEY!"
Mr. Gus says: "Why didn't you do that on a new layer?!"
Mr. Gus says: "!"
Giant Realistic Flying Tiger then pops in and roars.
Uncle Grandpa says: "Oh, hi Giant Realistic Flying Tiger!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "You got any advice for Steven?"
Giant Realistic Flying Tiger roars in response.
Uncle Grandpa says: "I'm not gonna tell him that."
Uncle Grandpa says: "That only works on cats."
Steven says: "Well..."
Steven says: "Now what?"
Uncle Grandpa says: "We just sit here until something happens."
Something then begins to suck Uncle Grandpa, Steven and Giant Realistic Flying Tiger away.
Uncle Grandpa says: "Something happened!"
Steven says: "Woaaaah, woaaah!"
The trio are sucked into a giant Belly Bag on a giant Uncle Grandpa.
Giant Belly Bag says: "*licks its lips* BUURRRPPPP!!!!"
Meanwhile, the Gems are seen running around in the blank white space, looking for an exit.
Garnet says: "Hoo, there's gotta be someway out here."
Pearl says: "*shivering* WE'LL NEVER ESCAPE!!!!"
Pearl says: "THIS IS OUR NEW HOME!!!!!"
Garnet says: "Pearl, you're overreacting."
Pearl says: "I'M NOT OVERREACTING!!!!!!!!"
Pearl starts running away the space, screaming at the top of her lungs, before crashing into Amethyst in her delirium.
Amethyst says: "*annoyed* Hey, where's Steven?"
Pizza Steve says: "*walks in , dressed up like Steven* Looking for me?"
Pizza Steve says: "PIZZA Steven Universe?"
Pearl says: "*gasps and freaks out* THAT'S NOT MY BABY!"
Amethyst says: "Aaaaw, nice!"
Pizza Steve says: "Woah, hold on!"
Amethyst says: "PIZZAAAA!"
Pizza Steve says: "Don't eat Pizza Steve!"
Amethyst devours Pizza Steve, pulls out his undigested glasses and wears them.
Garnet says: "Okay, I'm ready for this episode to end."
Garnet stomps on the floor, causing the blank white space to crack and break. They are back on the beach, when Steven, Uncle Grandpa, Lion, and Tiger are seen having a tea party on the sand.
Uncle Grandpa says: "*sighs* I'm sorry I couldn't help you learn to use your shield, Steven."
Steven says: "It's okay, Uncle Grandpa."
Steven says: "I had a lotta fun today."
Gems says: "STEVEN!!!"
Garnet says: "Get away from that man!"
Pearl says: "HE'S A MONSTER!!!"
Amethyst hisses and growls at Uncle Grandpa.
Steven says: "Hey, cut it out guys."
Steven says: "He's done enough already."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Oh, good mornin'!"
Amethyst pulls Uncle Grandpa in and the Gems start beating him up. They then leap into the sky, leaving a beaten-up Uncle Grandpa on the ground.
Uncle Grandpa says: "That smarts..."
Gems says: "*dives towards Uncle Grandpa* FINISH HIIIM!!!!!"
Steven says: "*rushes in as a chibi* No, don't hurt him!"
Steven says: "*jumps towards Uncle Grandpa after releasing a small fart* STOOOOP!!!!!!"
Steven's gem begins to glow and halts the Gems, in shock and surprise, with his shield.
Steven says: "Woaw!"
Giant Realistic Flying Tiger's jaw drops.
Steven says: "*turns to Uncle Grandpa* I did it, Uncle Grandpa!"
Steven says: "I really did it!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Yay..."
Pearl says: "Protecting HIM activated Steven's powers?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Garnet says: "He must really care about this stranger."
Amethyst says: "I hope he didn't care about that pizza..."
Steven says: "Listen!"
Steven says: "It was a big, weird surprise when Uncle Grandpa showed up here today."
Steven says: "You guys always do that for me."
Pearl says: "*blushing with tears in her eyes, feeling guilty and sorry* Steven, you're right."
Pearl says: "*cries loudly* HOW CAN I'VE BEEN SO BLIND!"
Pearl says: "?"
Pearl says: "I'M SO-RREEEEY!!!!!!!"
Pearl says: "AWWWW, AWEEEE!!!!"
Amethyst says: "I also apologize for Pearl."
Garnet says: "Thank you, you taught us a valuable lesson, Uncle Grandpa."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Welp, I think my work here is done."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Bye bye!"
Uncle Grandpa's propeller hat starts spinning, detaching Uncle Grandpa's head from his head. He hovers over the Giant Realistic Flying Tiger, flying in the sky, and his body pops back out atop of it. Lion howls as they begin to depart.
Uncle Grandpa says: "Remember kids!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Don't be afraid to be super we-e-e-eird!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Steven and I have got your back."
Uncle Grandpa says: "*his eyes turn cosmic* See with eyes unclouded by hate, and always remember to say..."
Uncle Grandpa says: "GOOD MORNING!"
A big "GOOD MORNINGÂ !!!!!!" message appears on the sky, as the Crystal Gems, crying, watch Uncle Grandpa departs.
Uncle Grandpa says: "*rubs his eyes* Boy, that sure makes my eyes hurt."
Uncle Grandpa says: "Now let's see here..."
Uncle Grandpa says: "*holds out and reads a checklist of several other Cartoon Network protagonists* Dexter, Deedee, Blossom, Bubbles, Buttercup, Ed, Edd, Eddy, Billy, Mandy, Mac, Juniper, Swat Kats, Flapjack, Finn, Oh!"
Uncle Grandpa says: "Steven..."
Uncle Grandpa says: "*checks it off* Now who's next?"
The star iris zooms in on Clarence's name. An ending card then appears, with the poorly drawing Pizza Steve, and reads "In Loving Memory of Pizza Steve".
END.
