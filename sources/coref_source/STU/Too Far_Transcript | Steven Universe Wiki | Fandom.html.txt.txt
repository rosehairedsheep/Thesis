Open Ext. the Barn.
Peridot is seen holding a tape recorder and speaking into it, using it to record all of her logs ever since her limb enhancers were thrown off the Galaxy Warp.
Peridot says: "Log date 7-11-2."
Peridot says: "It's the third rotation of the Earth since commencements of a..."
Peridot says: "*inhales deeply*..."
Peridot says: "collaborative approach to stopping The Cluster."
Pearl says: "I've finished drawing out the blueprints for the drill head."
Pearl says: "Peridot, if you could come take a look at this."
Peridot stops recording on her recorder.
Peridot says: "Remind me again why I should listen to you?"
Peridot says: "Oh, right."
Peridot rewinds her tape recorder.
Tape Recorder Peridot.
Amethyst snickers.
Pearl says: "Why did you give her that?"
Steven says: "Well, we did destroy all her stuff."
Steven says: "I thought it might make her feel a little better."
Tape Recorder Peridot.
Garnet says: "Alright, I chased away those cows, let's get to work."
Peridot says: "*clears her throat* Before we begin..."
Peridot says: "would you mind un-fusing?"
Peridot says: "It's making me incredibly uncomfortable."
Everyone breaks into an uncomfortable silence as Steven, Amethyst, and Pearl look at Garnet. Garnet then ties Peridot to a fence with a child leash and leaves her be.
Peridot says: "What?!"
Peridot says: "!"
Peridot says: "..."
Peridot says: "what'd I say?!"
Peridot says: "!"
Steven says: "Do we really have to do that?"
Garnet says: "Her having free reign of the place made me incredibly uncomfortable."
Peridot then attempts to reach for a nearby microwave, but the leash holds her back, forcing her to struggle to reach it. Meanwhile, Steven and Amethyst brings a bunch of spare parts to Pearl, who is cutting a turbine with a blowtorch.
Steven says: "Here you go, Pearl!"
Pearl says: "Oh, good."
Pearl says: "Hmm..."
Pearl says: "*inspects the parts* No..."
Pearl says: "No, no, no, no, I said I needed tungsten."
Pearl says: "Tungsten?"
Steven says: "Uh..."
Steven says: "what does "tungsten" look like?"
Amethyst says: ""Tongue-sten"."
Amethyst says: "*sticks out her tongue* Ahh."
Pearl says: "Ugh..."
Pearl says: "Never mind."
Pearl says: "I'll just do it."
Amethyst says: "*shrugs with her tongue still out* Meh.."
Peridot says: "*grunting while working with the microwave* I just need some sort of leverage optimizer."
Amethyst says: ""Leverage optimizer"?"
Peridot says: "That's what I said."
Amethyst says: "Ooooh!"
Amethyst says: "Ha, you mean you want a screwdriver?"
Peridot says: "Do you have one or not?"
Steven says: "Uh..."
Steven says: "."
Steven says: "why don't you just use this one?"
Peridot says: "Because it was outside my radius."
Amethyst says: "He-hey, hey Peridot, what do you call this?"
Peridot says: "A scent sponge."
Steven says: "Huh?"
Amethyst laughs, while Steven looks at and touches his own nose.
Amethyst says: "Okay, what's this?"
Peridot says: "Vision sphere."
Amethyst says: "Wait, wait, Steven."
Amethyst says: "Peridot, these?"
Peridot says: "*annoyed* Touch stumps."
Amethyst says: "This!"
Amethyst says: "?"
Peridot says: "*angered* Gravity connectors!"
Amethyst says: "This!"
Amethyst says: "?"
Peridot says: "THAT'S YOUR BUTT!"
Steven and Amethyst both laugh hysterically.
Steven says: "Oh man, Peridot, you're killing me!"
Peridot says: "I am not!"
Peridot says: "That would violate our truce agreement!"
Amethyst says: "No, no, no- You're funny!"
Peridot says: ""Funny"?"
Pearl says: "Peridot, if you can get the magnetron out of that microwave, we'll have everything we need..."
Pearl says: "except for the drill head."
Peridot says: "Why don't I just get an Injectors drill head from the Kindergarten?"
Pearl says: "..."
Pearl says: "Oh, well, I guess that's something you could try."
Garnet says: "She's not going to the Kindergarten without a chaperone!"
Peridot says: "What?"
Peridot says: "You've got to be joking!"
Garnet says: "*drops a stack of tires she is carrying* You'll know when I'm joking."
Peridot says: "Nyahhh..."
Amethyst says: "Me and Steven can go with her!"
Steven says: "Yeah, we'll keep an eye on her."
Garnet says: "Approved."
Garnet says: "Keep her in line, Amethyst."
Amethyst says: "You got it!"
Peridot groans at the proposal.
Trans. Int. Prime Kindergarten.
Peridot is logging on her tape recorder, while Steven and Amethyst are dismantling a broken Injector.
Peridot says: "Log date 7-11-2."
Peridot says: "The Amethyst and the Steven have volunteered to help me dismantle this Era 1 drill."
Peridot says: "How stylistically displeasing."
Peridot says: "The newer ones have a nicer finish."
Amethyst says: "You making more nerd notes?"
Peridot says: "*stops the recording* What is..."
Peridot says: ""nerd"?"
Peridot says: "Can you use it in a sentence?"
Amethyst says: "Ahem."
Amethyst says: ""Nerd"."
Amethyst says: "You are a nerd."
Steven says: "*jumps down from the Injector* Amethyst!"
Steven says: "Cut that out!"
Peridot says: "*speaks to her tape recorder* As you can see, this planet is annoying and everything is annoying."
Peridot says: "Amongst its..."
Peridot says: "transgressions is the need for the Amethyst to ask permission from the perma-fusion."
Amethyst says: ""Perma-fusion"?"
Amethyst says: "Is that what you call Garnet?"
Peridot says: "I could call her lots of things."
Peridot says: "*pulls down her tape recorder* I could call her two things!"
Peridot says: "Two clods!"
Peridot says: "*laughs* Walking around like she's..."
Peridot says: "one clod!"
Steven says: "What's wrong with that?"
Peridot says: "She's not even fighting!"
Peridot says: "She's, you know, she's just, y-you know like the..."
Peridot says: "*pounds her fists together* you know!"
Amethyst laughs hysterically while Steven pounds his fists together too in confusion.
Amethyst says: "You're a real gem, Peri."
Peridot says: "Yes, I am..."
Peridot says: "a Gem."
Amethyst says: "Okay, okay."
Amethyst says: "Do Steven next."
Amethyst says: "What's weird about Steven?"
Peridot says: "Where do I even begin?!"
Peridot says: "!"
Peridot says: "He's some sort of hybrid abomination, I don't even understand how he functions!"
Peridot says: "His organic half consumes so much energy that he has to constantly feed, and he spends so much time expelling, that he has a whole room dedicated to it!"
Steven says: "*blushes in embarrassment* Ah, no, something else!"
Steven says: "Talk about something else!"
Amethyst continues laughing hysterically, and Peridot decides to keep indulging her.
Peridot says: "*laughs* The strangest thing is, Amethyst, you think you have to listen to them!"
Peridot says: "*laughs* You're the one who should be in charge!"
Amethyst says: "Ha, that's your best joke yet."
Peridot says: "No, really."
Peridot says: "Pearl is a pearl, Garnet is a fusion, I don't even know what he's supposed to be!"
Steven says: "Hey!"
Peridot says: "You're the only Crystal Gem, that's actually a Gem!"
Amethyst says: "Uhm..."
Amethyst says: "*laughs nervously* What?"
Peridot says: "You outrank everyone on your team."
Peridot says: "They should be listening to you!"
Peridot says: "You're a strong, singular, fully-functional soldier, despite the fact you're defective."
Amethyst's face drops.
Amethyst says: "Defective?"
Peridot says: "Well sure!"
Peridot says: "You're small!"
Amethyst says: "So?"
Peridot says: "Well, you're not supposed to be!"
Peridot says: "Hold on, wait, wait."
Peridot says: "Let me guess."
Peridot says: "This!"
Peridot says: "This is the hole you came out of!"
Peridot says: "Too small, too low."
Peridot says: "The exit marks look 500 years newer than every other hole."
Peridot says: "Hmm, this place must have been empty when you came out."
Peridot says: "No wonder you have no idea what you're supposed to look like!"
Amethyst grows increasingly irritated.
Steven says: "Peridot..."
Amethyst says: "*halts Steven by placing her hand on his shoulder* What was I supposed to look like?"
Peridot says: "Well, you're a quartz."
Peridot says: "They're huge, loyal soldiers."
Peridot says: "You should be twice your size."
Peridot says: "Broad shouldered, intimidating."
Peridot says: "But you simply stayed in the ground too long."
Amethyst says: "*angered* Are you saying I'm wrong?!"
Amethyst says: "!"
Peridot says: "*laughs* Gemetically speaking, yes."
Peridot says: "When you think about it it's all so..."
Peridot says: "*snickers*..."
Peridot says: "funny!"
Peridot chuckles, while Amethyst looks upset and angry.
Steven says: "Amethyst?"
Peridot says: "Hey, soldier."
Amethyst summons her whip and violently severes the drill head off the Injector in one clean cut.
Peridot says: "See, look at that!"
Peridot says: "You can do everything a normal quartz can do."
Peridot says: "Let's head back, and shove this thing in Pearl's face!"
Steven says: "Amethyst?"
Steven says: "Are you okay?"
Amethyst says: "Don't worry about it."
Trans. Ext. the Barn.
Pearl is inspecting the drill head that Steven, Amethyst and Peridot brought back, while Steven and Peridot are separating the nails and screws.
Pearl says: "Oh, it's lovely!"
Pearl says: "To think we'd be using the same technology that started all this to fix it!"
Pearl says: "This drill is pure irony!"
Peridot says: "Actually, it's mostly carbonite."
Steven says: "Would that make it..."
Steven says: ""carbony"?"
Peridot groans at Steven's joke, when Amethyst walks past.
Peridot says: "Oh oh oh oh, Amethyst!"
Amethyst, still irritated, pauses and turns to look at Peridot.
Peridot says: "Check out this..."
Peridot says: "*picks up a hammer from the ground* Hmm..."
Peridot says: "Rhythmatic pulverizer!"
Peridot says: "?"
Peridot says: "*falls backwards on the ground laughing* That's funny, I'm so funny!"
Amethyst says: "Whatever, dude."
Peridot says: "That was the incorrect response."
Peridot says: "Hey, Amethyst isn't laughing when I do these things."
Peridot says: "Why isn't she laughing?!"
Peridot says: "!"
Steven says: "Peridot, you really hurt her feelings."
Peridot says: "What?"
Steven says: "You were pretty mean to her at the Kindergarten."
Peridot says: "Mean?"
Peridot says: "No way!"
Peridot says: "I was being..."
Peridot says: ""cool"."
Peridot says: "Amethyst loved it."
Peridot says: "She's probably telling the Pearl how much fun she had now."
Peridot says: "*sees Amethyst looking at her and waves at her* Amethyst, hi, hi, hi, Amethyst!"
Peridot says: "She..."
Peridot says: "she won't even look at me."
Peridot says: "It's making me feel..."
Peridot says: "smaller."
Steven says: "You feel bad!"
Steven says: "That's how you made her feel."
Peridot says: "*snorts* Who cares about how she feels?"
Peridot says: "Who cares about any of you?!"
Peridot says: "!"
Peridot says: "You're all just rocks!"
Peridot says: "Ruddy, muddy clumps beneath my gravity connectors!"
Pearl says: "Ugh, another one of her temper tantrums."
Pearl says: "I'm surprised you two made it back from the Kindergarten without driving each other crazy!"
Amethyst says: "Yeah..."
Time passes by, Peridot is working on the drill alone, grunting in frustration, while Steven is holding onto her leash.
Peridot says: "This little thing..."
Peridot then sees Amethyst walking past, without even turning to look at her. She grunts and returns back to working on the drill.
Steven says: "How's everything going up there?"
Peridot says: "Fine..."
Peridot says: "!"
Peridot says: "There's nothing wrong, everything's fine!"
Peridot says: "*pushes a button, which accidentally turns on the drill* Ah!"
Peridot says: "No, no, no, no, NO, STOP!"
Steven says: "Peridot?"
The drill starts spinning, causing Peridot to fall off of it.
Peridot says: "*coughs* The panel..."
Peridot says: "!"
Steven jumps onto the drill as it begins to spin out of control.
Peridot says: "Wait!"
Peridot tries to chase after Steven, but her leash gets caught on a piece of rock, tugging her back and causing her to fall to the ground. She then gasps in horror as Steven clings onto the drill.
Steven says: "It's okay, I got it!"
The drill spins out of control around the yard with Steven inside it. Unsuspecting, Amethyst comes around the corner of the barn, only to be faced with the drill heading towards her.
Amethyst says: "What the- GAAHHH?!"
Amethyst says: "!"
Peridot says: "Amethyst!"
Peridot pushes forward against her leash, causing it to rip, and manages to push Amethyst out of the way of the drill just in time. Steven manages to climb abroad the drill and rips out the control panel, successfully stopping it. .
Steven says: "*dizzy with spirals in his eyes* It's okay, everything's okay!"
Steven says: "It was just a drill!"
Peridot coughs, as dust clouds caused by the drill subside, and looks down to see that she is sitting on top of Amethyst, who is surprised that Peridot had saved her from the drill.
Amethyst says: "Uh..."
Amethyst says: "Peridot?"
Peridot says: "Ah!"
Peridot says: "*jumps off quickly* It was an accident, I swear!"
Steven says: "Hey, don't worry about it."
Steven says: "*walks towards Peridot and Amethyst* We know you didn't mean to start the drill."
Peridot says: "Uh..."
Peridot says: "yeah."
Peridot says: "That was an accident, too..."
Amethyst looks at Peridot in shock and confusion. Time passes by, Pearl and Garnet return to observe the havoc.
Pearl says: "*horrified* We leave for one second and everything goes off the rails!"
Garnet says: "I blame the cows."
Pearl says: "No, it's fine, it's fine."
Pearl says: "We'll rebuild it!"
Pearl says: "Stronger, better."
Pearl says: "We'll add seat belts!"
Amethyst and Steven are seen cleaning up after the drill, digging and pulling out items buried in the drill's rampage. Amethyst then pulls out an unicycle from the ground.
Steven says: "Hey, are you alright?"
Steven says: "That was a close one."
Steven says: "It's a good thing Peridot was there to save you."
Amethyst rolls her eyes and throws the unicycle away.
Peridot says: "*walks up from behind* Yes, it is a good thing."
Peridot says: "*pauses and stares at Amethyst for a bit* Listen, I..."
Peridot says: "uhm..."
Amethyst says: "Just spit it out."
Peridot says: "Ughh!"
Peridot says: "*facepalms* Why are you earthlings so difficult!"
Peridot says: "?"
Peridot slams the playback button on her tape recorder and holds it out to Amethyst.
Tape Recorder Peridot.
Peridot says: "*stops the tape recorder* As you can see—"
Steven says: "*touched* Oh, Peridot."
Peridot looks away, making an odd angry noise.
Amethyst says: "Peridot..."
Amethyst says: "..."
Amethyst says: "Thanks."
Peridot smiles awkwardly at her.
Amethyst says: "But you're still a nerd."
Peridot says: "*slightly annoyed* I'll be sure to add that to my notes."
Steven says: "How do you feel?"
Peridot says: "*pauses*..."
Peridot says: "Big."
