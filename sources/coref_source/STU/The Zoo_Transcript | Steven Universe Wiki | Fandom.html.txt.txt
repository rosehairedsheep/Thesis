Open Int. Pink Diamond's Zoo.
Following the events in Gem Heist, Steven emerges from a shallow body of water inside the human zoo, after the assimilation process. He coughs and gasps for air, as he looks around.
Steven says: "Where am I now?"
Steven spots Greg by the side of the water body, being groomed by two Zoomans.
Steven says: "Dad?"
Greg says: "Huh?"
Greg says: "Steven?"
Steven and Greg run over and give each other a hug.
Steven says: "Dad, it's you!"
Greg says: "Steven!"
Greg says: "My little man!"
Steven says: "Dad!"
Steven says: "When Blue Diamond took you, I got so scared."
Steven says: "And then the Gems said you might be in some horrible human zoo all chained up to a wall..."
Steven says: "doing tricks for peanuts..."
Greg says: "Hey, hey, it's okay, schtu-ball."
Greg says: "Your old man's perfectly fine."
Greg says: "Wait, how'd you even get out here?"
Steven says: "We got on a Gem ship from Earth."
Steven says: "I'll tell you about it on the way home."
Steven says: "I got separated from the Gems."
Steven says: "We got to find them and bust you out of here."
Steven begins searching in the water body where he popped out from.
Greg says: "Well, you're not gonna get out that way."
Greg says: "I've already tried."
Steven says: "What?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "Well, there might be another way out if we can find it."
Zooman 1.
Ga-reg! *approaches the pair* Who is that with you?
Zooman 2.
Is this a new friend, Ga-reg?
Steven says: "*gets aggressive* Let me have my dad back already!"
Greg says: "Hey, don't be like that."
Greg says: "Relax."
Greg says: "These people have treated me so well since I got here."
Steven says: "Wha?"
More Zoomans pop out from the bushes nearby.
Zooman 3.
Greetings! Greetings!
Zooman 4.
Wow, Ga-reg!
The Zoomans being to gather around Steven to greet him, mumbling among themselves.
Greg says: "Everyone, this is Steven."
Greg says: "He's my son!"
Steven says: "Uhh..."
Steven says: "Hi."
Zoomans says: "Hi!"
Steven says: "Thanks for..."
Steven says: "braiding my dad's hair."
Greg says: "Steven, these people are the descendants of humans brought here by Gems thousands of years ago."
Greg says: "They've never seen the Earth before."
Greg says: "Isn't that wild?!"
Greg says: "!"
Wy-Six says: "Ste-van, Ga-reg has told stories of you."
Wy-Six says: ""The bits, the bits!"
Wy-Six says: "" That's you, right?"
Zoomans says: "The bits, the bits, the bits!"
Zooman 5.
Come on, say it.
Steven says: "Let's get out of here."
Steven says: "We came across a door that leads into the zoo, but we couldn't open it from the other side."
Steven says: "Let's find it and try to open it from in here."
Greg says: "A door?"
Greg says: "Really?"
Greg says: "All right."
Greg says: "Let's find it tonight."
Greg says: "It'll be easier to look for it after the routine."
A chime is sounded from the earrings, and a voice begins to speak to everyone.
Greetings, everyone. It's time to start the daily routine. Please enjoy your meal during this designated eating period.
Steven says: "Who was that?"
Wy-Six says: "Ste-van does not know what a little voice is."
Wy-Six says: "Just like Ga-reg when he first arrived."
The Zoomans begin laughing altogether.
Jay-Ten says: "Our little voices guide us through life here."
Little Voice says: "You all must be hungry now."
Zoomans says: "Yes- yes."
Steven says: "Umm..."
Steven says: "Dad?"
Greg says: "Don't worry, Steven."
Greg says: "We'll get out of here."
Greg says: "But for now, let's just play along."
Steven and Greg follow the Zoomans to the designated eating location, where purple crystal fruits are grown from the trees.
Jay-Ten says: "Here you go, Ga-reg."
Greg says: "Oh, thank you."
Wy-Six says: "Ste-van, today the fruit is purple."
Little Voice says: "Are you enjoying the food?"
Zoomans says: "Oh, yes: Little Voice: How is the food?"
Zoomans says: "Is it good?"
Wy-Six says: "Yes."
Wy-Six says: "It is delicious."
Steven glances at the Zoomans, obediently complying to the little voice without questions, in uneasy as he eats on his fruit.
Little Voice says: "Now it is time to play."
Greg and the Zoomans begin rolling down the hill and laughing, except Steven, who rolls down uncomfortably. Everyone then lies together on the grass.
Little Voice says: "Now, everyone, reach up like you're going to touch outer space."
The Zoomans comply and reach their hands upwards. Steven and Greg eventually comply as well.
Little Voice says: "That's it."
Little Voice says: "Reach up high."
Little Voice says: "Wasn't that fun?"
Wy-Six says: "I have not had that much fun since yesterday!"
Little Voice says: "It's time to stop and smell the flowers."
The Zoomans begin smelling flowers inside a shaded garden, which Steven and Greg just watch on.
Steven says: "What if..."
Steven says: "I don't want to smell the flowers?"
Jay-Ten says: "Why wouldn't you want to do that?"
Jay-Ten puts a flower on Steven's head. Steven takes off the flower and looks at it in unrest.
Little Voice says: "Time to clean up, everyone."
Little Voice says: "Let's all take a refreshing bath."
The Zoomans begin bathing in a pool next to a basalt column waterfall. They all relax, laugh and splashes together in the water.
Jay-Ten says: "Watch my splash, Ga-reg!"
Greg says: "Nice one!"
Wy-Six says: "Ga-reg!"
Wy-Six says: "Watch mine!"
Wy-Six dives into the water from a higher ground, yet resulting in just a small ripple.
Steven says: "Those are the tiniest splashes I've ever seen."
Greg says: "Watch this."
Greg says: "Hey, Wy-Six, you ever heard of a "cannonball"?"
Wy-Six says: "*chuckles* I've never heard it."
Wy-Six says: "Tell me what it is."
Greg says: "Check this out."
Greg says: "I'll show you."
Greg says: "Cannonball!"
Greg jumps into the pool, causing a big splash. The Zoomans begins cheering and cannonball into the water too.
Zoomans says: "*laughing* Cannonball!"
Zoomans says: "Cannonball!"
Little Voice says: "*to Steven* Wouldn't you like to clean off in the pool?"
Steven says: "All right!"
Steven says: "All right."
Wy-Six says: "Yeah!"
Wy-Six says: "Cannonball!"
Greg says: "Hey, you hanging in there?"
Steven says: "I can't believe this."
Steven says: "They're all so happy."
Steven says: "It's like..."
Steven says: "they don't even know that they're trapped here."
Greg says: "Well, of course they don't."
Greg says: "They've never been anywhere else."
Greg says: "They love it here, I mean, look at this place."
Greg says: "Can you blame them?"
Greg says: "They've got everything they need, and they never have to worry about a thing."
Steven says: "I guess you're right."
The light acting as the Sun starts getting blocked off, turning the sky starry night, and the earrings chime again.
Little Voice says: "And now it's time to say good night."
Little Voice says: "Good night, everyone."
Little Voice says: "Sweet dreams."
The Zoomans begin falling asleep around the pool area.
Greg says: "Geez, I sure am tired from doing a whole lot of nothing."
Greg says: "Well, good night, schtu-ball."
Greg begins to lie on a grass bed, when Steven halts him.
Steven says: "Dad!"
Steven says: "Now's our chance to get out!"
Steven and Greg begins sneaking around the containment area to search for the exit door.
Greg says: "Man, little voice has really got me on that Zooman sleep schedule."
Steven bumps into a wall, which turns out to be the door they are looking for.
Steven says: "Is that..."
Steven says: "It's the door."
Greg says: "Great."
Greg says: "How do we get it open?"
Steven begins banging on the door, when Wy-Six and Jay-Ten pop out from the bushes nearby.
Wy-Six says: "Ga-reg!"
Greg says: "Oh!"
Jay-Ten says: "Ste-van!"
Steven says: "Huh?"
Wy-Six says: "So you're the ones making the noise."
Jay-Ten says: "What are you doing?"
Jay-Ten says: "Is it a game?"
Wy-Six says: "Can we play, too?"
Steven says: "It's not a game."
Steven says: "We need to get this door open."
Jay-Ten says: "What is a..."
Jay-Ten says: ""door"?"
Steven says: "Like, this part of the wall but open."
Wy-Six says: "*chuckles* Walls don't open."
Wy-Six says: "They're walls."
Jay-Ten says: "There is a story of an opening wall."
Jay-Ten says: "A very long time ago, a Gem came through a wall hole to help someone who was..."
Jay-Ten says: ""hurt"."
Wy-Six says: "What do you mean "hurt"?"
Jay-Ten says: "I don't know."
Jay-Ten says: "I don't know what "hurt" is."
Steven says: "I know what hurt is!"
Together says: "You do?"
Steven says: "Umm, it's like when you feel.."
Steven says: "bad."
Wy-Six says: ""Bad"?"
Steven says: "Yes, like, the opposite of good."
Steven says: "*sighs* If that's the only way out, then, Dad, slug me in the face."
Greg says: "What?!"
Greg says: "!"
Greg says: "I'm not gonna hit you!"
Steven says: "It's our ticket out of here."
Steven says: "One of us has to get hurt."
Greg says: "Okay, well..."
Greg says: "Then you hit me."
Steven says: "You sure?"
Greg says: "Yeah."
Greg says: "I'll take one for the team."
Steven proceeds to punch Greg in his face, but delivers a dud instead.
Greg says: "Come on, give me all you got."
Greg says: "I can take it."
Steven proceeds to punch Greg again, for real this time, and sends him flying into a tree, causing him to groan in pain.
Wy-Six says: "Cannonball!"
Steven says: "Uhh..."
Steven says: "how was that?"
Greg says: "Good."
Greg says: "Anyone coming?"
Steven says: "Doesn't look like it."
Steven says: "Should I..."
Steven says: "try it again?"
Greg says: "There won't be anything left to rescue if you do."
Steven says: "What do we do now?"
The earrings chime again.
Greg says: "Whatever she says."
Little Voice says: "It is time for the choosening."
Little Voice says: "Please gather around the circle of choosening."
Jay-Ten says: "Ste-van, Ga-reg, the choosening will start soon."
Wy-Six says: "Come with us."
Wy-Six says: "It's- it's finally time!"
Wy-Six and Jay-Ten bring Steven and Greg to the circle of choosening, where the Zoomans are gathered around a glowing circle on the ground, giggling in joy.
Jay-Ten says: "Ga-reg, step into the circle with us."
Greg says: "Is it somebody's birthday?"
Wy-Six says: "Ste-van, wait here until the choosening is complete."
Jay-Ten says: "The choosening is a very special event to us."
Wy-Six says: "We're glad to have you with us at such a wonderful time."
Greg says: "Glad to be here."
Little Voice says: "Let the choosening begin."
Greg and the Zoomans close their eyes.
Little Voice says: "U-12, please step into the center of the circle."
Little Voice says: "F-3, please step into the center of the circle."
Two Zoomans step into the center of the glowing circle. They then hold hands and kiss each other.
Little Voice says: "You have been choosened for each other."
Greg says: "Wait a second."
Greg says: "Is this some kind of matchmaking thing?!"
Greg says: "!"
Greg says: "*groans* There's always a catch to these utopias."
Jay-Ten says: "Ga-reg, whoever is choosen for you will be very lucky."
Little Voice says: "Jay-Ten, please step into the center of the circle."
Greg says: "Oh boy."
Greg says: "Steven, help me..."
Greg says: "!"
Steven says: "Don't worry, Dad."
Steven says: "You're new here, so maybe you won't get choosened."
Greg says: "Right!"
Little Voice says: "Ga-reg, please step into the center of the circle."
Greg says: "Hold on!"
Greg says: "Maybe there's been a mistake?"
Wy-Six says: "Ga-reg, Jay-Ten is waiting for you."
The Zoomans begin cheering on Greg.
Wy-Six says: "I see what's going on here."
Greg says: "You do?"
Wy-Six says: "You are just shy!"
Greg says: "Huh!"
Greg says: "?"
Wy-Six says: "Do not worry about it."
Wy-Six says: "*pushes Greg towards Jay-ten and laughs* Now touch hands."
Greg says: "Hold on!"
Greg says: "This isn't how it works on Earth!"
The Zoomans stare at Greg.
Greg says: "I..."
Greg says: "don't want to be told who to be choosened with."
Wy-Six says: "Ga-reg, this makes no sense."
Wy-Six says: "Why wouldn't you want to be choosened?"
Greg says: "Look, back on Earth, there was no voice to tell you who to be with."
Greg says: "It was your own decision."
Steven says: "My mom and dad didn't get together because someone told them to."
Steven says: "They spent time getting to know one another and fell in love."
Steven says: "They choosened each other 'cause that's what they choosed."
Wy-Six says: "Hmm, I see."
Wy-Six says: "If that's how it's done on Earth, then..."
Wy-Six says: "*grabs Greg's hand* I choose Ga-reg."
Jay-Ten says: "And I also choose Ga-reg."
The Zoomans gather around Greg, all chanting "I choose Ga-reg" as well.
Greg says: "Wait!"
Greg says: "I get a say in this, too."
Greg says: "You're all very nice, and I'm flattered, and yes, you get to choose whoever you want, but..."
Greg says: "I also get to say I choose, umm..."
Greg says: "none of you."
The Zoomans are shocked by Greg's comment and begin breaking down, crying hysterically.
Greg says: "Woah!"
Greg says: "Hey, don't cry."
Greg says: "You can choose someone else."
Jay-Ten says: "I feel..."
Jay-Ten says: "not good."
Jay-Ten says: "I feel..."
Jay-Ten says: "bad..."
Jay-Ten says: "?"
Wy-Six says: "Could this be..."
Wy-Six says: "Is this..."
Wy-Six says: ""hurt"?!"
Wy-Six says: "!"
Jay-Ten says: "Why would Ga-reg "hurt" us?"
Jay-Ten says: "Take this "hurt" away!"
The Zoomans all reach out to Greg and begin approaching him in their depression.
Steven says: "I choosen, to take my dad and run away."
Steven lifts Greg above his head and runs away into the forest, to escape from the Zoomans.
Greg says: "Watch out for that- Oof!"
Greg slams into a tree branch, falling off of Steven's hands. Steven quickly drags the groaning Greg aside and manages to hide away from the Zoomans chasing them.
Greg says: "I haven't broken this many hearts since I had all my hair."
The door then opens, and a bunch of Amethyst guards rush in to avert the crisis.
Steven says: "Yipe!"
Guard 1.
Greg says: "This is nuts!"
The Amethyst guards begin rounding up the crying Zoomans and talking to them.
Guard 2.
Wy-Six says: "I'll never choosen again."
Guard 3.
Sure you will.
Greg says: "Hey, that door's still open."
Steven says: "This might be our only chance."
Steven and Greg make a dash towards the door, but an Amethyst guard catches of them and lifts them up.
Guard 4.
Oh, no, you don't!
Steven says: "Put us down!"
Amethysts.
You two are in big trouble.
END.
