Open Ext. The Barn.
The Crystal Gems are preparing decorations for Steven's birthday. Amethyst is blowing balloons, Pearl is making a ribbon bow, and Steven is helping Garnet make a banner.
Steven says: "I can't believe it's finally my birthday."
Steven says: "You're sure it's okay we're taking a break from the drill?"
Pearl says: "Peridot will keep us on schedule."
Amethyst says: "Yo, Peri!"
Amethyst says: "You sure you don't want to get in on this?"
Amethyst blows up a balloon that looks like Peridot and it pops. Peridot glares, puts on her welding goggles and disappears around the corner of the barn.
Garnet says: "We should celebrate our progress."
Garnet says: "We should celebrate your progress."
Garnet says: "You've grown a lot this year."
Pearl says: "He certainly has."
Steven says: "Yeah."
Steven says: "Yeah, I guess so!"
A car horn is then heard, as Greg's Van arrives. Wearing a red party dress and a floppy sun hat, Connie climbs out clutching a suitcase.
Connie says: "Steven!"
Steven says: "Connie!"
Connie says: "Happy birthday!"
Steven says: "Thanks."
Steven says: "Welcome to the party!"
Steven says: "May I offer you..."
Steven says: "a refreshment?"
Connie says: "Oh, Steven!"
Connie says: "How genteel."
Steven says: "Clink!"
Connie says: "Clink!"
Steven says: "So, this is the barn!"
Steven says: "I'm surprised your parents are letting you stay for the weekend."
Connie says: "*chuckles* It wasn't easy."
Connie says: "They'd only let me come after equipping me with every piece of safety gear on the planet."
Greg says: "What should I do with this defibrillator!"
Greg says: "?"
Connie says: "*blushes* Um, we can just leave it in the car for now!"
Steven says: "*giggles* Well, I'm glad you could make it."
Connie says: "Me too."
Greg says: "Alright, move it Connie, I was his best friend first."
Greg says: "Happy birthday!"
Greg says: "*hugs Steven tightly* Ooookay, schtu-bal."
Greg says: "Let me get a look at you."
Steven says: "*embarrassed* Daaad!"
Greg says: "Sorry, I just can't believe my little boy is growing up so quickly."
Greg says: "Seems like just yesterday you were a baby, and now you're turning fourteen years old."
Connie says: "*does a spit-take* Steven!"
Connie says: "You're fourteen!"
Connie says: "?"
Steven says: "Yeah?"
Connie says: "But I'm only twelve and three quarters!"
Connie says: "You're older than me?"
Connie says: "I-I don't believe it!"
Greg says: "Well sure, check it out."
Greg says: "Let's see, we have infant, baby, toddler - what's it called - adolescent, adolescent, adolescent, adolescent..."
Greg says: "Whoa, looks like you stagnated there a little bit, buddy."
Connie says: "Mr."
Connie says: "Universe, could I..."
Connie says: "show you how the defibrillator works?"
Greg says: "Oh, uh, sure!"
Greg says: "Be right back, kiddo."
Trans. back of Greg's Van.
Steven decides to eavesdrop on Connie and Greg's conversation.
Connie says: "So he's not going to grow up?"
Greg says: "Well, it's hard to say."
Greg says: "He's a Gem, and Gems don't really grow up."
Greg says: "I mean, I've known the Gems since I was 22, and they never change!"
Greg says: "They just are what they are."
Greg says: "But Steven's not like the other Gems, he's half-human."
Greg says: "So, I'm not really sure how he's gonna age."
Greg says: "We're just gonna have to wait and see."
Connie says: "Yes, right."
Greg says: "Are you okay?"
Connie says: "Yeah, yeah."
Greg says: "Human beings?"
Connie says: "Human beings."
Steven ponders with visible concerns.
Trans. Ext. The Barn.
Everyone is setting up the birthday party. Steven tries to hang up the banner on the barn, but he is too short.
Amethyst says: "Hey, birthday man!"
Amethyst says: "What'cha doing?"
Steven says: "I want to hang up this banner."
Amethyst says: "Dude, it would be easier you just streeeeetch right up here!"
Amethyst says: "*extends her limbs and holds the banner at the barn's door* Hahaha!"
Amethyst says: "How's that?"
Steven says: "Oh yeah..."
Amethyst says: "Come on!"
Amethyst says: "What's the verdict?"
Amethyst says: "I can't hold this forever."
Steven says: "Uh, it looks great."
Greg says: "There's my b-day guy."
Amethyst retracts her limbs back to normal and walks away, while Greg, carrying Steven's Birthday Suit, approaches Steven.
Steven says: "Uh, what's up dad?"
Greg says: "We're almost ready to start."
Greg says: "Got your birthday cape and crown ready too."
Greg says: "Here."
Greg says: "*hands the birthday suit to Steven* Put it on and go wait in the barn."
Greg says: "*pushes Steven into the barn and snickers* Okay now, sit tight."
Greg says: "You're gonna love this."
Greg shuts the barn door with Steven inside. Steven throws his birthday suit aside and looks at his hands. He clenches his hands and begins to focus. Fade to black.
Greg says: "*knocking on the door* Okay Steven, open up!"
Steven opens the barn door, and Greg, Connie and the Gems are standing outside, presenting a Cookie Cat-shaped birthday cake.
Greg says: "SURPRI-!"
Connie says: "SURPRI-!"
the Gems says: "SURPRI-!"
Garnet says: "Wow."
Pearl says: "Oh my."
Greg says: "Huh?"
Everyone glare in shock, as Steven, now taller than usual, smiles and walks towards them, carefully taking each step forward.
Pearl says: "Steven..."
Pearl says: "Are you feeling okay?"
Garnet says: "Heh, you look good Steven."
Steven says: "*in teenager voice* Oh!"
Steven says: "*chuckles* Thanks, Garnet."
Amethyst says: "Dude, your neck!"
Steven says: "Oh, uh, what about it?"
Amethyst says: "You HAVE one!"
Connie says: "So, you just grew..."
Connie says: "all of a sudden?"
Steven says: "I had a magical growth spurt, just now."
Steven says: "Cool, right?"
Connie says: "Oh, right!"
Connie says: "It's totally cool!"
Garnet says: "Alright then, let's get this party started."
Greg says: "Yeah, let's eat this cookie cake!"
Time Skip.
Connie and Steven sit alone on a picnic mat, when Lion naps besides them.
Connie says: "Here, Steven."
Steven says: "Wow, thanks."
Connie says: "Oh, you don't have to untie that."
Connie says: "It's just a box made to look like I spent a lot of time wrapping it."
Steven says: "*opens the box, tossing away the lid* Ohhh a new shirt!"
Steven says: "What a pretty color."
Connie says: "Try it on."
Steven puts on the shirt and tries to button it up.
Steven says: "No, don't worry."
Steven says: "It fits fine just like this!"
Steven decides to wear the shirt like a coat and giggles.
Time Skip.
Steven, Amethyst, Pearl and Connie are playing badminton together.
Pearl says: "Here it comes!"
Connie says: "I got it, Pearl!"
Pearl says: "Nice, Connie."
Amethyst says: "Hiiii-yah!"
Pearl says: "If you hit it, you get it."
Connie says: "No worries, I'll grab it."
Connie runs up to the tree and tries to jump and grab the shuttlecock, but fails. She then tries to climb the tree.
Steven says: "Connie, let me."
Steven runs up, jumps and grabs onto the branch, causing the shuttlecock drop off the tree.
Connie says: "Oh, cool, thanks Steven!"
Steven says: "No problem, Connie."
Amethyst says: "Yo, bring back that shuttlecock!"
Steven says: "Huh?"
Connie runs off, when Steven's arm begins to shrink down to its former size.
Steven says: "*gasps* Oh no!"
Steven then uses his gem power to stretch his arm again, and he sighs in a strained relief.
Time Skip - Evening.
Pearl, Amethyst, Connie and Steven are dancing, while Garnet and Greg browse an array of vinyl disks to play. Greg pulls out a disc cover titled "Stella", and Garnet shoves her hand in Greg's face. Everyone is having fun, although Steven seems to be straining and sweating.
Garnet says: "This one goes out to the birthday boy, and his best friend."
A calm romantic music begins to play, and Steven and Connie laugh. They both then begin dancing together.
Connie says: "I still can't believe all this time you were older than me."
Connie says: "You should sneak me into a PG-13 movie sometime."
Steven says: "*sweating* Oh yeah..."
Connie says: "*giggles* No, I'm just kidding, I would never ask you to break the law."
Connie says: "It's funny that I have to look up at you now though."
Steven says: "*gets fidgety* Funny good or funny bad?"
Connie says: "Funny good."
Pearl says: "Aw..."
Pearl says: "Steven's having fun."
Garnet says: "We know how to throw a party."
Steven says: "*clears his throat* Excuse me for a moment Connie, I'm gonna go freshen up."
Steven says: "Be right back."
Steven runs to the side of the barn, seemingly out of view of everyone, and shrinks himself back to normal size.
Steven says: "*in normal voice* Ohhh geez..."
Steven's eyes widen, as he spots Greg and Amethyst, playing with a piñata, glaring at him. Greg then drops the piñata in shock.
Amethyst says: "What are you doing?!"
Amethyst says: "!"
Amethyst says: "?"
Steven says: "W-Wha..."
Steven says: "Well uh..."
Steven says: "*ages himself again * What are..."
Steven says: "*in teenager voice* YOU doing?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "?"
Greg says: "What are YOU doing to your body?!"
Greg says: "!"
Greg says: "?"
Amethyst says: "Woah, woah, woah, have you been stretching yourself out all day?"
Steven says: "No!"
Steven says: "I was just..."
Steven says: "slouching."
Greg says: "Why are you doing this?"
Greg says: "It..."
Greg says: "really isn't like you."
Steven says: "Because, Dad, I can't stay a kid forever, when Connie grows up and becomes president what is that gonna make me?"
Steven says: "First Boy!"
Steven says: "?"
Amethyst says: "Steven, you can't just keep stretching forever."
Amethyst says: "If you hold it too long, you could really hurt yourself."
Steven says: "Yeah well, I'm half human so maybe it works different for me, we'll just have to wait and see, right?"
Greg says: "*sigh* Steven..."
Steven walks off, while Amethyst and Greg exchange concerned looks.
Time Skip - Night-time.
Steven and Connie are sitting on a mat and star-gazing.
Connie says: "That one's..."
Connie says: ""Canis helicopterus"."
Steven says: "*sweating profusely* Uh-uh, "Helicopterus"?"
Connie says: "Yeah, Dogcopter, get it?"
Connie says: "*elbows Steven playfully* Now you make one up!"
Steven says: "Okay, um..."
Steven says: "*clears his throat* That one's, uh, snake constellation."
Connie says: "That's..."
Connie says: "pretty good.."
Connie says: "Are you okay?"
Connie says: "It looks like you're gonna throw up."
Steven says: "Oh yeah, e-everything's fine!"
Connie says: "Okay..."
Connie says: "that's good."
Connie says: "You know, to be honest, I was a little worried before."
Connie says: "This might sound silly, but..."
Connie says: "*leans towards Steven* I'm really glad that I'm going to get grow up with you."
Steven becomes overwhelmed and begins to shrink, seemingly disappearing into his clothes.
Connie says: "..."
Connie says: "Steven?"
Connie says: "*pulls Steven's shirt aside, revealing an infant Steven* Steven?!"
Connie says: "!"
Connie says: "What's going on?"
Connie says: "What happened?"
Steven says: "Whaa?"
Steven blushes and examines his shrunken body. He looks at Connie and begins to cry. Connie then carries the crying infant Steven to show to everyone.
Pearl says: "He turned back into a baby?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Connie says: "YES!"
Amethyst says: "*takes Steven* Dude, I told you..."
Amethyst says: "Stretching your body out for that long is not good for you!"
Steven speaks baby talk in response.
Amethyst says: "*holds Steven up to Pearl* Here you go, Pearl."
Pearl says: "Oh, no, no, don't give him to me!"
Garnet says: "Hand him over, Amethyst."
Amethyst says: "*gives Steven to Garnet* Here you go."
Garnet holds Steven up and starts blinking her eyes one by one. She then sticks out her tongue and makes funny noises to cheer Steven up. Steven, however, keeps crying.
Garnet says: "My power means nothing to an infant."
Greg says: "Okay, this is my department."
Connie says: "What are you going to do?"
Greg says: "Don't worry, I got this."
Trans. Int. Greg's Van.
Greg begins driving Connie and Steven, who is still crying, away from the barn while "Let Me Drive My Van into Your Heart" plays in the background. Connie tries waving a maraca to cheer Steven up but it does not work.
Connie says: "How can the Gems not know what to do?"
Greg says: "You think they know the first thing about raising a baby?"
Greg says: "That was all me, but I don't get it, driving always used to calm him down."
Connie says: "But, how do we change him back?"
Greg says: "I don't know!"
Greg says: "Look Connie, let me take you home, I-I'll call you when this all this gets sorted out."
Connie turns to look at Steven, while he tries to communicate in baby talk.
Connie says: "W-Wait no, I wanna stay."
Greg says: "Are you sure?"
Connie says: "Yeah, I just want to be there for Steven."
Connie says: "Don't worry Steven, it doesn't matter to me what age it seems like you are, I wanna hang out with you no matter what."
Connie says: "Your dad still has his car wash and the Gems have to do gem stuff so I'll watch you when they're not around."
Connie says: "I can come see you after I'm done training with Pearl too."
Connie says: "Doesn't that sound fun?"
Connie holds up her finger to Steven, coos happily and holds onto it.
Greg says: "Look at that, he finally stopped crying."
Connie says: "Well that's a start."
Amethyst says: "Ahem."
Greg says: "What's up, Amethyst?"
It is revealed that Amethyst had shapeshifted into a carseat for the infant Steven the whole time.
Amethyst says: "Baby Steven needs changin'."
Trans. Ext. The Barn, The Next Morning.
Connie wakes up in her tent, only to find Steven's shirt lying next to her.
Connie says: "Oh my gosh."
Connie says: "Ooh my gosh!"
Connie says: "Did he get even smaller?"
Connie says: "Steven's microscopic!"
Connie says: "*tears up* He's reverted back to a zygote!"
Connie says: "*rushes out of the tent* Everyone!"
Connie sees Steven, back to normal, wearing the shirt she gave him.
Steven says: "Look, it fits now."
Connie says: "*wipes her tears* You're back to normal!"
Steven says: "Sorry this was a disaster, I wanted to look older for you."
Connie says: "That doesn't matter."
Steven says: "I..."
Steven says: "heard what you said in the van."
Steven says: "It's really okay if I don't age like a human?"
Connie says: "Of course it is."
Connie says: "I like you just the way you are."
Steven says: "Oof, okay."
Connie says: "Uh..."
Connie says: "Steven?"
Connie says: "You've got something on your cheek."
Steven says: "Huh?"
Steven says: "*feels it and gasps* It's a facial hair!"
Connie says: "Really!"
Connie says: "?"
Steven says: "DAD!"
Greg says: "What is it little man?"
Steven says: "Look at this!"
Greg says: "Holy smokes!"
Greg says: "You're growin' a beard!"
Greg says: "You really are getting older."
Greg says: "*hugs Steven* Everybody!"
Greg says: "Look at this!"
Pearl says: "Unbelievable."
Garnet says: "Very impressive."
Amethyst says: "Is there more where that came from?"
The Gems start laughing together, and Connie giggles in relief too. The star iris then closes on Connie smiling, ending the episode.
END.
