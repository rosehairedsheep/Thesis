Open Ext. Beach Citywalk Fries.
Steven is talking to Peedee at the fry shop counter.
Steven says: "And your dad won't even let you alphabetize the condiments?"
Steven says: "That's rough."
Steven and Peedee look over to the arcade, where they see Mr. Smiley whistling while putting up a seemingly new machine outside the Funland Arcade.
Steven says: "*starry eyed* Whoa, I wanna see what that is."
Steven says: "*walks over* Hi Mr."
Steven says: "Smiley!"
Steven says: "Is that game new?"
Mr. Smiley says: "Ha ha!"
Mr. Smiley says: "Not even close."
Mr. Smiley says: "I've had old Zoltron here in storage."
Mr. Smiley says: "You got a quarter?"
Mr. Smiley says: "We can see if he still works."
Zoltron Robot says: "*activates and starts juddering* I am Zoltron: Robot fortune teller from the future."
Zoltron Robot says: "I know your future, because I am from there."
Steven says: "*excitedly* Whoa!"
Mr. Smiley says: "*laughs* Go ahead!"
Mr. Smiley says: "Ask him anything."
Steven says: "I've just been dying to know!"
Steven says: "*holds up a quarter* Will I get that fancy Kazoo I've always wanted?"
Zoltron Robot says: "Your lucky numbers today are.."
Zoltron Robot says: "16, 47, and W."
Steven says: "*disappointed*..."
Steven says: "Can I have my quarter back?"
Mr. Smiley says: "Ha, if I had a quarter every time somebody asked for their quarter back..."
Mr. Smiley says: "Oh wait, I do!"
Mr. Smiley says: "*makes drumming motions* "Ba dum bum ching!"
Steven says: "*confused*..."
Steven says: "What?"
Mr. Smiley says: "It was a joke."
Mr. Smiley says: "Man, I must be rusty."
Mr. Smiley says: "Been a while since my comedy days."
Steven says: "You used to be a comedian?"
Mr. Smiley says: "Yeah!"
Mr. Smiley says: "But that was a long time ago."
Steven says: "What were some of your jokes?"
Mr. Smiley says: "*looks away* I'd rather not talk about it."
Steven says: "Did you have any knock knock jokes?"
Mr. Smiley says: "You wanna ask questions, ask Zoltron."
Steven says: "*inserts another quarter* Hey Zoltron."
Steven says: "Why did Mr."
Steven says: "Smiley quit comedy?"
The Zoltron machine whirs for a bit, but says nothing.
Steven says: "*pats the back of the robot* You can do it, buddy."
The Zoltron robot suddenly explodes and falls to pieces, shocking both Steven and Mr. Smiley.
Steven says: "Ah!"
Steven says: "I just gave it a little tap!"
Mr. Smiley says: "A little tap!"
Mr. Smiley says: "?"
Mr. Smiley says: "Do you know how EXPENSIVE this machine was?!"
Mr. Smiley says: "!"
Mr. Smiley says: "?!"
Mr. Smiley says: "!"
Steven says: "It was an accident!"
Steven says: "I'll make it up to you!"
Steven says: "Please, I-I just don't want to be banned from any more of your businesses!"
Mr. Smiley starts laughing to maintain a smile under his angry demeanor, when he suddenly has an idea.
Mr. Smiley says: "Hmm..."
Mr. Smiley says: "Hey, you do a pretty good robot voice, don't you?"
Time-Skip.
Steven giggles excitedly as he sits inside the machine, dressed up like Zoltron and taking its place. He then hears Sadie and Lars talking as they pass by.
Lars says: "*exasperatedly* Sadie, come on!"
Lars says: "It's likeÂ all you wanna do is work!"
Lars says: "Let's go watch a movie at your place or something!"
Lars says: "Nobody will even notice we're gone."
Sadie says: "Heh, somebody will notice."
Sadie says: "You know, when they need a donut or something."
Zoltron Steven.
Sadie says: "What is that?"
Lars says: "Don't change the subject!"
Sadie says: "I'm not, this is just interesting."
Zoltron Steven.
Ask me anything!
Lars says: "Ugh, look at its face!"
Sadie says: "Alright Zoltron."
Sadie says: "Since you know everything, should we skip work?"
Lars says: "*sarcastically* Oh great."
Lars says: "Sic the robot on me."
Zoltron Steven.
You should go to work because... Because... even though Lars won't admit it, he really likes to do a good job. Lars is shocked at Zoltron's mention of his name. Letting people depend on him fills his heart with warm feelings. Like love, and trust.
Lars says: "*blushes* No, it doesn't!"
Zoltron Steven.
And even though Sadie loves to take charge-.
Sadie says: "*blushes in shock and embarrassment* No I don't..."
Zoltron Steven.
She'll still be impressed with all your effort!
Steven smiles and freezes, leaving Lars and Sadie dumbstruck.
Sadie says: "..."
Sadie says: "Is it weird that it knows our names?"
Lars says: "Uhh I don't wanna talk about it."
Lars says: "*turns to Sadie* You.."
Lars says: "wanna go to work?"
Sadie says: "Yeah, let's."
Lars and Sadie hurry off, still creeped out. Onion then arrives, about to walk into the arcade with a crowbar in his hands, when Steven stops him.
Zoltron Steven.
Halt! If you're not careful.. Zoltron sees prison bars in your future.
Onion thinks about it for a moment and leave. Steven sighs in contentment, when Onion returns, wearing a ski mask, and enters the arcade out from Steven's sight. Time passes by as more people come to check out the curious Zoltron machine. Kiki and Jenny, who are arguing with each other, uses the machine first.
Zoltron Steven.
Zoltron sees that both of you are right. You do deserve your own rooms.
Kiki and Jenny stop arguing and nod at each other, while Kofi shakes his head in disapproval. Buck uses the machine next.
Zoltron Steven.
Zoltron predicts you won't need to worry about that stain. You can make anything look cool.
Buck tightens his stained jacket in satisfaction. Ronaldo, accompanied by his family, uses the machine next.
Zoltron Steven.
Zoltron knows that even if he seems stuck in his ways, deep down, your father really loves you.
Ronaldo gives Mr. Fryman a big hug. Time passes by as the crowd of people slowly disperse, each leaving in happiness through Steven's positivity. Mr. Smiley then comes in to collect the quarters from the machine.
Mr. Smiley says: "How's it going out here?"
Zoltron Steven.
Great! I really feel like I'm making a positive change in people's lives.
Mr. Smiley says: "Are they paying you for it?"
Zoltron Steven.
Yes, sir!
Mr. Smiley says: "Then keep it up, Zoltron!"
Zoltron Steven.
Sure!
Mr. Smiley leaves, and a man, wearing a trench-coat and frowning heavily, can be seen in the distance on the boardwalk. He then walks up to the Zoltron Machine and begins speaking in a British accent.
Mr. Frowney says: "Hm, a fortune-telling machine."
Mr. Frowney says: "This should be good for a laugh."
Zoltron Steven.
That's right. I am Zoltron! Beep, boop! Give me your questions and your money.
Mr. Frowney says: "*inserts a quarter* Was it a mistake to come here?"
Zoltron Steven.
Zoltron says, uh... Of course not? Um... Funland is fun... for all ages.
Mr. Frowney says: "*inserts another quarter* Will talking to him make any difference?"
Mr. Frowney says: "Any difference at all?"
Zoltron Steven.
Zoltron isn't sure. Human emotions are really complicated for Zoltron.
Mr. Frowney says: "*inserts another quarter* Tell me the truth."
Mr. Frowney says: "Do I really just drive everyone around me away?"
Zoltron Steven.
Z-Zoltron says your lucky numbers for today are 47, 16, and "W". Come back later?
Steven curls down inside the machine in awkwardness from the man's complicated questions. The frowning man is about to insert another quarter but he misses the coin slot of the machine, dropping the coin. He gasps as the quarter rolls away and falls between a gap in the boardwalk.
Mr. Frowney says: "My final quarter!"
Mr. Frowney says: "*sighs and crouches down on the boardwalk* Even coins don't want to be around me."
Zoltron Steven.
Garnet says: "I knew you'd say that."
Zoltron Steven.
Garnet! I-I need your help with-.
Garnet says: "The future."
Zoltron Steven.
Oh, yeah! I need some of that. Can I borrow your future vision? I want to help some random stranger I just met.
Garnet says: "That seems like an appropriate use of my powers."
Garnet smooches Steven on his forehead, transferring her future vision ability onto him.
Garnet says: "There you go."
Garnet says: "That should last a little while."
Garnet says: "Try to be home in time for dinner."
Zoltron Steven.
Thanks, Garnet!
Garnet says: "*walks towards the frowning man* He's ready to answer your question."
Garnet says: "Use this."
Steven quickly freezes in place as the frowning man returns and inserts the quarter into the machine.
Mr. Frowney says: "What would he say if he saw me now?"
Steven's future vision activates, and the first option appears before him in a slot machine style.
Zoltron Steven.
He'll say, "I'm happy to see you.".
Mr. Frowney says: "You're lying."
Mr. Frowney says: "Nobody's happy to see me."
Option 2 appears.
Zoltron Steven.
He'll say, "It's been too long.".
Mr. Frowney says: "I'm too late?"
Mr. Frowney says: "I should've come sooner!"
Option 3 appears.
Zoltron Steven.
I don't know, I'm just a boy in a costume!
Mr. Frowney says: "*sighs* Of course."
Mr. Frowney says: "Everything in my life's a disappointment."
A big red cross strikes across all three options as a buzzer is heard, to Steven's dismay.
Zoltron Steven.
Zoltron sees... sadness in your future no matter what you do.
Mr. Frowney says: "That sounds about right."
Mr. Frowney says: "I guess the curtain really did close on Mr."
Mr. Frowney says: "Smiley and Mr."
Mr. Frowney says: "Frowney."
Zoltron Steven.
You're here to see Mr. Smiley?! *gasps as he realizes he accidentally broke character*.
Mr. Frowney says: "Nobody misses our act, not even him."
Mr. Frowney says: "*sighs* I don't know why I'm talking to a machine."
Mr. Frowney says: "I'll just get on the bus and leave."
Steven watches in sorrow as Mr. Frowney walks off. Time passes by, Steven is seen talking to Suitcase Sam.
Zoltron Steven.
Zoltron says that's a question for your doctor.
Suitcase Sam leaves, and Mr. Smiley returns.
Zoltron Steven.
Uh, Mr. Smiley! Mr. Smiley!
Mr. Smiley says: "Hey, don't break character."
Mr. Smiley says: "You broke enough things today."
Zoltron Steven.
I met Mr. Frowney.
Mr. Smiley says: "What?!"
Mr. Smiley says: "!"
Zoltron Steven.
He's in town. Uh, how did you know him?
Mr. Smiley says: "We used to have a..."
Mr. Smiley says: "routine."
Zoltron Steven.
Oh! Comedy. But he didn't seem very funny. Actually, he was really depressing.
Mr. Smiley says: "Yeah, that was the bit."
Mr. Smiley says: "At least, I thought it was, but even offstage, he was always sad."
Mr. Smiley says: "Nothing would cheer him up, not even a packed house, not a standing ovation, not even me."
Mr. Smiley says: "And, boy, did I try."
Zoltron Steven.
Well, he's about to leave town on a bus. You should go talk to him before it's too late.
Mr. Smiley says: "I don't know what'd happen if I did."
Steven's future vision activates again, with three options appearing in a slot machine style. Option 1 appears.
Mr. Smiley says: "Wow!"
Mr. Smiley says: "Funny running into you."
Mr. Frowney says: "Of course."
Mr. Frowney says: "I'm still a punchline, aren't I?"
Option 2 appears.
Mr. Smiley says: "Hey!"
Mr. Smiley says: "Wow!"
Mr. Smiley says: "You look great!"
Mr. Frowney says: "That's your best joke yet."
Option 3 appears.
Mr. Smiley says: "Hi, buddy!"
Mr. Frowney says: "Is that all you have to say?"
A big red cross strikes across all three options as a buzzer is heard, again, to Steven's dismay.
Zoltron Steven.
Zoltron sees sadness in your future, no matter what you do.
Mr. Smiley says: "Ughh..."
Mr. Smiley says: "Come on, Steven."
Mr. Smiley says: "Drop the act."
Zoltron Steven.
Wait a second. *climbs out of the machine* You said you were always trying to make him happy. Did he even know that he was making you sad?
Mr. Smiley says: "*pauses* You said he was getting on a bus?"
Zoltron Steven.
Yeah.
Mr. Smiley starts running towards the bus stop and Steven chases after. They find Mr. Frowney waiting at the bus stop, who is surprised to see Mr. Smiley.
Mr. Frowney says: "Harold?"
Mr. Smiley says: "Quentin."
Mr. Frowney says: "How'd you know I was here?"
Mr. Smiley says: "Little robot boy from the future told me."
Zoltron Steven.
Uh, hi, again.
Mr. Frowney says: "*shocked* He came to life!"
Mr. Smiley says: "*chuckles* No, fool."
Mr. Frowney says: "Did you just come here to laugh at me?"
Mr. Smiley says: "..."
Mr. Smiley says: "No."
Mr. Smiley says: "I'm here to tell you that.."
Mr. Smiley says: "I wanted it to work- our act."
Mr. Smiley says: "But it wasn't making you happy."
Mr. Frowney says: "I just wanted you to take it seriously."
Mr. Smiley says: "And I just wanted you to have fun."
Mr. Frowney says: "Oh..."
Mr. Frowney says: "*starts weeping* I guess it was never going to work..."
Mr. Frowney says: "But I really thought we had something."
Mr. Smiley looks down in remorse, as Mr. Frowney wipes away his tears and turns away.
Mr. Smiley says: "You..."
Mr. Smiley says: "having a bad day, Frowney?"
Mr. Frowney says: "*turns back in surprise* Horrible."
Mr. Smiley says: "Well, why don't you go outside?!"
Mr. Smiley says: "!"
Mr. Smiley says: "The sun always cheers me up!"
Mr. Frowney says: "I did, but it rained."
Mr. Smiley says: "Why don't you use an umbrella?"
Mr. Frowney says: "I did, but it blew away."
Mr. Smiley says: "Ooh!"
Mr. Smiley says: "You must have been shocked!"
Mr. Frowney says: "Yeah, that's when the lightning hit me."
Steven watches in confusion, until he realizes Mr. Smiley and Mr. Frowney are reenacting one of their rountines.
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "Ooohh!"
Mr. Frowney says: "Smiley, what do you do when you're feeling down?"
Mr. Smiley says: "I just take my frown and turn it around!"
Mr. Smiley picks Mr. Frowney up and holds him upside down. Mr. Frowney then starts chuckling.
Mr. Smiley says: "Hey, you're ruining the bit!"
Mr. Smiley says: "I thought you were a professional."
Steven chuckles as well as Mr. Smiley turns Mr. Frowney upright, who is now smiling.
Mr. Frowney says: "*sighs* I think I finally got the joke."
Mr. Frowney gives Mr. Smiley a hug, and they embrace each other for a while. A bus eventually arrives, Mr. Frowney gets on it, and Mr. Smiley and Steven wave him goodbye.
Zoltron Steven.
Well, I guess my debt is repaid.
Mr. Smiley says: "*laughs, and then stops* Steven, that machine costs thousands of dollars."
Zoltron Steven.
Zoltron sees cramped legs in his future.
The star iris closes onto Steven's foot, ending the episode.
END.
