Open Int. Aquamarine's Ship.
Following the events in "I Am My Mom", after surrendering himself to the hands of Aquamarine, Steven is held in the hands on a Topaz.
Aquamarine says: "The Rose Quartz."
Aquamarine says: "Can you believe it?"
Aquamarine says: "And she just handed herself in."
Steven says: "That's right."
Steven says: "You caught me."
Steven says: "Galactic Criminal Rose Quartz."
Steven says: "I love shattering Diamonds."
Steven says: "I just want to shatter 'em all the time."
Aquamarine says: "You think shattering's bad?"
Aquamarine says: "Wait till the Diamonds get their hands on you."
Steven says: "At least everyone else is safe."
Just then, the other Topaz brings Lars up from the basement of the ship.
Lars says: "What are you doing?"
Lars says: "Let go of me!"
Lars says: "*grunts* Steven!"
Steven says: "What the- Lars?!"
Steven says: "!"
Aquamarine says: "Oh!"
Aquamarine says: "Looks like we got one of the humans anyway."
Aquamarine says: "Don't know what we'll do with just one of them, but I guess that's for the Diamonds to decide."
Steven says: "Wait!"
Steven says: "Aquamarine, the deal is off!"
Steven says: "You were only supposed to take me!"
Steven says: "No humans!"
Steven says: "*points at Lars* That's a human!"
Aquamarine says: "Oh, no."
Aquamarine says: "Is Rosie upset 'cause her widdle "deal" didn't work?"
Aquamarine says: "Look."
Aquamarine says: "I'm so moved, I'm crying."
Aquamarine says: "*laughs tauntingly* Just kidding."
Aquamarine says: "That's my gem."
Aquamarine says: "Topaz, what do you think?"
Aquamarine says: "Should we let her friend go?"
The Topazes stand in silence.
Aquamarine says: "I agree."
Aquamarine says: "*laughs* Go on."
Aquamarine says: "Do your thing."
Lars says: "Oh, no, no, no."
Lars says: "Not again."
The Topazes begin to fuse together, merging Steven and Lars within their body.
Aquamarine says: "I'll go let the Diamonds know about our little prisoner."
Aquamarine says: "Say, Rose, how do I look?"
Steven says: "Awful, small, and mean!"
Aquamarine says: "*laughs* Is that how you flattered so many Gems into joining your rebellion?"
Aquamarine says: "How cute."
Aquamarine says: "*pulls Steven's cheek* Topaz, I trust you'll still be able to fly the ship despite your..."
Aquamarine says: "you know..."
Aquamarine says: "additions?"
(Minor Objects/Vehicles#Aquamarine.27s Ship says: "Lars: Steven, this is all your fault."
(Minor Objects/Vehicles#Aquamarine.27s Ship says: "All this weird alien stuff- this is 'cause of you, isn't it?"
Steven says: "Yes, of course it is!"
Steven says: "That's why I turned myself in, to save all of you!"
Lars says: "Well, it didn't really work out too well, did it?"
Steven says: "Well, everyone else managed to get off the ship."
Steven says: "So, where were you?"
Lars says: "I ran and hid, Steven, like any sensible person would..."
Lars says: "do, if they wanted to get trapped on a ship."
Lars says: "Oh."
Steven says: "Lars..."
Lars says: "Sadie was in trouble, and I didn't do anything."
Lars says: "Actually, wait."
Lars says: "I did do something."
Lars says: "I ran and hid just like I always do."
Lars says: "Just like I ran from the potluck."
Steven says: "But you were abducted."
Steven says: "That's not your fault."
Lars says: "No, I trashed my roll and ran away."
Lars says: "Then I was abducted."
Lars says: "Oh, why couldn't I just let people eat my food?!"
Lars says: "!"
Steven says: "*sighs* We have to get you out of here."
Steven says: "Here, just leave it to me."
Steven says: "*glances at Topaz* Hey!"
Steven says: "Look!"
Steven says: "You have Rose Quartz!"
Steven says: "Why bother with him!"
Steven says: "He's worthless!"
Lars says: "Thanks a lot, Steven."
Steven says: "No!"
Steven says: "I meant like "worth less," not "worthless" like..."
Steven says: "relative to me?"
Lars says: "At least I make a great seat cushion."
Lars says: "You feeling cozy, you big banana?"
Topaz does not respond.
Steven says: "I don't think she's listening."
Steven says: "Can you hear me, you- What was it Jamie said?"
Steven says: "You dangerous yellow coat?"
Lars says: "Of course she can't hear you, Steven."
Lars says: "She's got those big headphones on."
Steven sighs in defeat, when the ship starts to rumble, causing Topaz to squeeze Lars' head against her seat.
Aquamarine says: "*sighs* Those Crystal Gems must have screwed up the engine during takeoff."
Aquamarine says: "Topaz, go fix it."
Topaz complies and heads to the ship's basement to check on the engine.
Steven says: "Lars, look for something that can help us."
Lars grunts in pain, having be squeezed on Topaz's seat. Topaz begins operating the engine control panel, when Steven spots something nearby.
Steven says: "*gasps* A destabilizer."
Steven says: "That's perfect!"
Lars says: "A destaba-what?"
Steven says: "It's a weapon that disrupts a Gem's physical form."
Lars says: "Cool."
Lars says: "Thanks for explaining."
Lars says: "I still don't know what that means."
Steven says: "Just hear me out."
Steven says: "I have a plan."
Steven says: "I'm gonna need you to be my arms."
Lars says: "Ugh."
Lars says: "Fine."
Steven says: "Lars, pull my pants off."
Lars says: "What?!"
Lars says: "!"
Steven says: "Trust me!"
Steven says: "I'm trying to save you."
Lars says: "What if I don't want to be saved?"
Lars says: "What if I want to stay trapped here and fly around space, and why your pants, you weirdo?!"
Lars says: "!"
Steven says: "Just do it!"
Lars begrudging complies and removes Steven's pants off of him.
Lars says: "Ugh."
Lars says: "There."
Lars says: "I did it."
Steven says: "Great."
Steven says: "Now tie one of the legs into a lasso."
Lars says: "I can't."
Lars says: "They're on the floor."
Steven says: "What are they doing on the floor?!"
Steven says: "!"
Lars says: "I don't know, Steven."
Lars says: "What are we doing in space?"
Steven says: "Lars, pick them up and then tie them into a lasso."
Lars says: "Ugh."
Lars says: "Fine."
Lars says: "*ties Steven's pants into a lasso* Wow."
Lars says: "It worked."
Lars says: "We're back home."
Lars says: "Great plan."
Steven says: "*sighs in annoyance* Now lasso the destabilizer."
Lars says: "I still don't know what that is."
Steven says: "That."
Steven says: "That thing!"
Steven says: "Come on, Lars."
Steven says: "You can do it!"
Lars says: "Ugh."
Lars says: "Fine."
Lars swings the lasso half-heartedly, knowing he cannot reach the destabilizer.
Steven says: "Come on."
Steven says: "Just one more try."
Lars says: "I don't want to try again."
Steven says: "Lars, throw the lasso!"
Lars says: "Fine!"
Lars crumbles Steven's pants and throws it at the destabilizer rack, which was already out of reach.
Steven says: "What is your problem, Lars?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "Why did you do that?!"
Steven says: "!"
Lars says: "Why do you think I'm capable of anything?!"
Lars says: "!"
Lars says: "You think I can do all this stuff, but I can't!"
Lars says: "I can't because..."
Lars says: "I'm a wuss, Steven."
Lars says: "I'm just..."
Lars says: "*sniffles*..."
Lars says: "afraid."
Lars says: "I've always just been stupid and afraid."
Lars says: "*begins tearing up* Not like you."
Lars says: "You're always helping people."
Lars says: "You're never afraid."
Steven says: "Lars..."
Steven says: "I'm afraid right now."
Lars turns to look at Steven.
Steven says: "I thought if I turned myself in, it'd fix everything, but..."
Steven says: "I don't want to do this, Lars."
Steven says: "I've been to space before, but not like this."
Steven says: "They're taking me straight to their terrible leaders that want to destroy Earth and destroy me for something I never even did."
Steven says: "I just wanted to save everyone, but I couldn't even do that because, look, you're still here."
Lars says: "Steven..."
Steven says: "I'm sorry."
Steven says: "I don't know how I'm gonna get you out of this."
Lars says: "We'll..."
Lars says: "figure it out."
Lars says: "We've got like..."
Lars says: "a billion light-years till we get there, right?"
Steven says: "For the first time ever, you're gonna look on the bright side?"
Steven says: "Y-You don't have to sugarcoat this, but come on, you never do that."
Steven says: "You're always real with me about how much everything sucks."
Lars says: "Okay."
Lars says: "You're right."
Lars says: "This is really, really messed up, Steven."
Steven says: "You know what's even more messed up?"
Steven says: "Even though you're in huge trouble and it's all my fault..."
Steven says: "*tears up* I'm kind of glad you're here?"
Steven says: "I..."
Steven says: "I don't want to be alone right now."
Steven says: "*sobs* Isn't that awful?"
Lars says: "Dude, At this point, everything is awful."
Steven and Lars tear up and chuckle together.
Steven says: "I'd give you a hug, but I can't use my arms."
Lars says: "I could try using my legs, but it might be weird."
Just then, Topaz begins to cry too.
Topaz says: "That's so, so beautiful."
Topaz says: "*sniffles* Even in the clutches of certain doom..."
Topaz says: "You're happy to have each other."
Lars gasps in surprise.
Steven says: "T-T-Topaz."
Topaz says: "I don't know what Topaz would do if she didn't have Topaz."
Topaz says: "I've always wanted to tell me how I'm helping me through this, but there's always someone between us!"
Steven looks away in awkward.
Topaz says: "They're always sending me on these miserable missions."
Topaz says: "*wipes her tears with Steven's pants* I'm always pretending I'm fine with it."
Topaz says: "*sniffles* I have to pretend I'm fine."
Topaz says: "But you two..."
Topaz says: "You're so honest and open..."
Topaz says: "so..."
Topaz says: "*sniffles* I wanna help you guys."
Topaz says: "What do you need?"
Steven says: "A way off this ship."
Steven says: "And my pants."
Topaz says: "All right."
Topaz says: "You can use this escape pod."
Topaz says: "*activates an escape pod* I'll set the coordinates for Earth."
Steven says: "All right, Lars, just get in and let it do its thing."
Lars says: "Guh."
Lars says: "What are you talking about?"
Lars says: "You're coming, right?"
Steven says: "I can't."
Steven says: "I turned myself in."
Steven says: "I still got to go."
Steven says: "Someone's got to pay for what my mom did."
Lars says: "But you don't want to do this?"
Lars says: "Dude, forget it."
Lars says: "Let's just go."
Aquamarine says: "Topaz, what are you still doing down here, you big boulder?"
Aquamarine says: "We're almost to Homeworld."
Aquamarine flies down into the basement, and Topaz gasps in shock, being caught in the act.
Aquamarine says: "*glares at Topaz* What..."
Aquamarine says: "are..."
Aquamarine says: "you..."
Aquamarine says: "doing?"
Topaz says: "Look, I can explain."
Topaz says: "Um, they had this whole heartfelt thing about being there for each other, and you missed it."
Topaz says: "It was so moving."
Aquamarine pulls out her wand and points it at Topaz.
Topaz says: "*gasps* No!"
Topaz says: "Wait!"
Aquamarine fires a tractor fire, which Topaz jumps out of the way, and hits the escape pod instead.
Lars says: "I can't see what's happening."
Lars says: "Are we still escaping?"
Aquamarine says: "No!"
Aquamarine says: "Nobody's escaping!"
Aquamarine hurls the escape pod at a wall, poofing it away.
Topaz says: "Aquamarine, let's talk about this."
Steven says: "Yeah, I-I bet you don't really want to hurt us."
Steven says: "You -- You probably just act mean because deep down you're afraid you're weak."
Steven says: "Go ahead."
Steven says: "Let it out."
Steven says: "We're all sharing right now."
Aquamarine glares at Steven in perplexity, unshaken by Steven's statement, and quickly begins to lecture Topaz again.
Aquamarine says: "Topaz, you had one job, and if you're not gonna do it, you're of no use to me!"
Topaz whimpers as Aquamarine prepares to fire her wand again. Topaz then notices the destabilizers, quickly grabs one, and pins Aquamarine against the engine control panel. Steven and Lars watch on in shock and surprise.
Aquamarine says: "So..."
Aquamarine says: "a revolt, huh?"
Aquamarine says: "And what do you plan to do after this?"
Aquamarine says: "Go back to the Diamonds?"
Aquamarine says: "My gem in your hand?"
Aquamarine says: "I'm sure they'll love that."
Aquamarine says: "You'll be rewarded handsomely..."
Aquamarine says: "by being separated, and shattered."
Topaz quickly drops the destabilizer, releases Aquamarine and kneels over in sorrow.
Topaz says: "What was I thinking?"
Aquamarine says: "*picks up the destabilizer* That's the problem with you fusions."
Aquamarine says: "Sooner or later, you all become sentimental."
The ship rumbles again and a notification pops up on the engine control panel.
Aquamarine says: "We're here."
Aquamarine says: "Look, just..."
Aquamarine says: "unfuse, and we'll never speak of this again."
Topaz complies, unfusing back into two Topazes, and walk out of the ship, each with Steven and Lars in their captivity.
Steven says: "Topaz, you don't have to do this."
The Topazes remains uninfluenced as Steven and Lars continue to struggle to break from their hold. The Topazes meet a fork in their path, and walk their separate ways.
Steven says: "Wait."
Steven says: "Lars!"
Lars says: "Steven!"
Lars says: "Where are they taking us?!"
Lars says: "!"
Steven says: "I don't know!"
Lars says: "Steven!"
Steven says: "Lars!"
Two doors close behind the two Topazes, as they both carry Lars and Steven into separate places.
END.
