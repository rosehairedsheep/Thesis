Open Ext. It's A Wash.
It is raining outside. Steven and Greg are having a jam session inside Greg's van, parked outside the car wash.
Steven says: "Woo!"
Steven says: "Go Dad!"
Greg says: "See?"
Greg says: "What'd I tell you?"
Greg says: "I may be losing my hair but the magic's still there."
Greg drinks from a can of soda as a photo, that was stuck to the bottom of the can, falls off.
Greg says: "Hmm?"
Steven says: "*catches the photo* Who's with you in this old picture?"
Greg says: "Haha."
Greg says: "That's my pal Marty."
Steven says: "You've never told me about him."
Greg says: "Yeah he's just an old amigo from way back when..."
Greg says: "*smiles* He's dead to me."
Steven says: "Who was he?"
Greg says: "*tunes his guitar* He was my manager back when I first met your mom."
Greg says: "I've told that whole story haven't I?"
Steven says: "Not the version with Marty..."
Greg says: "Yeesh, well then it's story time."
Greg says: "Sit back, get comfy!"
Greg says: "I didn't mean that comfy..."
Steven says: "*excitedly* Story for Steven!"
Greg says: "Okay, okay..."
Greg says: "This is the tale of how your father met your mother..."
Greg says: "Now including Marty."
Greg starts playing his guitar, as he retells the tale to Steven, setting a flashback.
The tale begins with a younger Greg, holding a solo concert on the beach of Beach City, playing and singing "Comet".
Greg says: "♫ Some..."
Greg says: "say I have no direction, / that I'm a light-speed distraction, / but that's a knee-jerk reaction / Still..."
Greg says: "this is the final frontier, / everything is so clear, / to my destiny I steer."
Greg says: "/ This life in the stars is all I've ever known, / stars and stardust in infinite space is my only home."
Greg says: "/ But the moment that I hit the stage, / thousands of voices are calling my name."
Greg says: "/ And I know in my heart it's been worth it all of the while."
Greg says: "/ And as my albums fly off of the shelves, / handing out autographed pics of myself."
Greg says: "/ This life I chose isn't easy but sure is one heck of a ride."
Greg says: "/ At the moment that I hit the stage, / I hear the universe calling my name."
Greg says: "/ And I know deep down in my heart I have nothing to fear."
Greg says: "/ And as the solar wind blows through my hair, / knowing I have so much more left to share."
Greg says: "/ A wandering spirit who's tearing its way through the cold atmosphere."
Greg says: "/ I'll fly like a comet."
Greg says: "/ Soar like a comet."
Greg says: "/ Crash like a comet."
Greg says: "/ I'm just a comet."
As Greg finishes his song, he finds only a single Rose attending his concert, clapping for him.
Greg says: "Thanks for coming everybody, I'm Mr."
Greg says: "Universe."
Greg says: "If you like what you just heard go check out our merch table!"
Greg says: "My manager Marty can hook you up with CDs, and t-shirts - Oh, wait, he's not there..."
Greg says: "I guess I'm going over there now..."
Greg walks and sits at his merchandise table. Rose approaches and picks up a CD.
Rose says: "*reads the disc cover* "Space Train to the Cosmos"..."
Greg says: "Yeah!"
Greg says: "♫ One way ticket and I'm ready to ri~ide!"
Rose says: "*chuckles* How will you get back?"
Greg says: "Back?"
Rose says: "Back to Earth?"
Greg says: "*leans on his chair* I'm NEVER coming back."
Rose says: "Oh!"
Rose says: "That's awful!"
Rose says: "This is your home."
Greg says: "Uhh..."
Greg says: "you want that?"
Greg says: "You can have it..."
Rose says: "Hm?"
Greg says: "Oh, and it comes with a free T-shirt!"
Greg says: "*pulls out a small "Mr."
Greg says: "Universe" T-shirt* You'll probably need a bigger one..."
Greg says: "I've got an extra extra large in my van!"
Greg says: "Stay right there!"
Greg opens the back door of his van, and Marty and Vidalia jump out.
Marty says: "Star child!"
Marty says: "Meet Vidalia."
Vidalia says: "Nice van."
Vidalia says: "*blows a bubblegum* Really livin' the high life."
Marty says: "So, how was the show?"
Greg says: "It was great!"
Greg says: "One person showed up!"
Greg says: "Oh!"
Greg says: "I have to give her this free..."
Greg says: "T-shirt..."
Greg grabs a XXL T-shirt from the van to give to Rose, but she is not around anymore.
Marty says: "Greg!"
Marty says: "You can't give stuff away for free!"
Marty says: "What about my 75 percent?"
Marty says: "75 percent of nothing is nothing."
Marty says: "Are YOU worth nothing?"
Greg says: "No..."
Marty says: "That's right."
Marty says: "I'm going to make us both rich."
Marty says: "*leans forward to whisper into Greg's ear* And as far as these salt water saps know, we already are."
Marty says: "*backs off and puts his arm around Vidalia* So let's live it up before we hit the road, alright?"
Marty says: "Next stop, Empire City!"
Marty and Vidalia walk away.
Greg says: "Y'know, I'll catch up with you..."
Greg walks down the boardwalk, approaching a fence along the beach, with a sign that says 'KEEP OFF BEACH'. Below is a sign that reads 'Please' in neat cursive. Greg looks past the fence and sees part of the Crystal Temple.
Greg says: "Maybe she's over there?"
A purple owl perched on the fence hoos at Greg.
Greg says: "*jokingly talks to the owl* Ah, just some giant mysterious lady with enormous pink hair."
Greg says: "You haven't seen anyone like that around, have ya?"
Purple Owl says: "Sure have, pal!"
Greg says: "*gulps in surprise* W-where..."
Greg says: "?"
Purple Owl says: "*chuckles and turns to Greg* Well, uh..."
Purple Owl says: "If I told you any more I'd have to KILL YOU!"
Purple Owl says: "*flexes her feathers menacingly* Hoo, hoo, hoahahaha!"
Greg says: "Hey!"
Greg says: "*climbs over the fence* WAIT!"
Greg says: "Hold on a sec- Whoa, oomph!"
Greg falls over the top of the fence, landing on the other side, and starts chasing the purple owl. He follows her into the entrance of the temple, where he finds Pearl, with the purple owl perched on her arm.
Purple Owl says: "This long-haired human was talking to me over by the fence!"
Pearl says: "It spoke to you?"
Purple Owl says: "He was asking about Rose."
Purple Owl says: "*turns her head 180°* Look, there he is!"
The purple owl takes off of Pearl's arm, hitting Pearl in the face with her wing.
Pearl says: "Ugh, Amethyst, wait!"
The purple owl shapeshifts back into normal, realizing to be Amethyst, whose appearance  very reminiscent of a toddler's.
Amethyst says: "It's YOU!"
Amethyst says: "*lands in front of Greg, scaring him* I've never seen this one around here before..."
Amethyst says: "*crawls around Greg* Aww..."
Amethyst says: "I really like your hair!"
Amethyst crawls underneath Greg's hair and lifts up his shirt, causing him to blush. Pearl jumps over to pull Amethyst away, as Greg pulls down his shirt.
Pearl says: "Amethyst!"
Pearl says: "Leave him be!"
Pearl says: "You don't know where he's been!"
Pearl says: "*turns to Greg* I'm very sorry about this..."
Pearl says: "umm..."
Pearl says: "you."
The temple Warp Pad then glows and Garnet warps in, holding two bubbled gems in both hands.
Greg says: "Woah..."
Garnet says: "Pearl, Amethyst."
Garnet says: "*sends the bubbled gems away* You're with a human."
Amethyst says: "*happily* He followed me over the fence!"
Pearl says: "What should we do?"
Garnet leans in on Greg and glares at him, reflecting his face on her visor.
Garnet says: "State your purpose."
Greg says: "*nervously* Uhh..."
Greg says: "I was kinda looking for the mysterious pink lady."
Greg says: "Kinda really tall..."
Greg says: "lots of big curly hair?"
Amethyst says: "See, he's talking about Ro—"
Pearl says: "*to Garnet* I don't know how to make him go away."
Garnet says: "I'll just throw him back over the fence."
Greg says: "Huh?"
Garnet grabs Greg and lifts him over her head. Greg moans in protest as he's carried off.
Pearl says: "Excellent idea!"
Pearl says: "Humans should stay on the other side of the fence like the sign says."
Greg says: "Please!"
Greg says: "No throwing!"
Rose says: "*shouts from behind* Wait!"
The Gems turn around and see Rose, rushing out of the temple.
Rose says: "Mr."
Rose says: "Universe?"
Greg says: "It's you."
Greg says: "Whoa!"
Greg says: "- Ow!"
Garnet drops Greg quickly and blushes. Rose then jumps forwards, lands gracefully in front of Greg, and offers her hands to him.
Rose says: "Are you alright?"
Greg takes her hand, and the two exchange gazes at each other for a moment, until Pearl barges in.
Pearl says: "You know this human?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Rose says: "He was playing a concert on the beach, and I couldn't help myself."
Greg says: "No one can ignore the Universe."
Greg says: "Oh!"
Greg says: "*holds out the XXL T-shirt* I brought you this."
Greg says: "It's the free t-shirt that came with the free CD!"
Rose says: "*takes the T-shirt* Why, thank you!"
Rose says: "(The other Gems crowd around Rose to look at the T-shirt"
Rose says: "."
Rose says: "*whispers* His gimmick is space!"
Pearl chuckles at Rose's comment.
Amethyst says: "Hey, play something, music man!"
Garnet says: "*summons her gauntlet* Better make it good."
Greg says: "Aw man, I'm working on this awesome new set, it's gonna kill at my next show!"
Greg says: "Next show..."
Greg says: "Aw jeez, what time is it?"
Pearl says: "*looks up at the sky* Nnnight..."
Pearl says: "time?"
Greg says: "Yeah, Marty's probably looking for me."
Greg says: "We're supposed to hit the road..."
Greg says: "Big show in a big city..."
Greg says: "and I didn't drop out of community college for nothing!"
Pearl says: "What?"
Rose says: "Well, you better hurry."
Rose says: "You don't wanna miss your space train to the cosmos."
Greg says: "Okay!"
Greg says: "*begins to run off* I'll see you later!"
Greg says: "*pauses, turns back and shout to Rose* Uh, I hope the stars will align for us to meet again!"
Rose says: "I'm sure they will!"
Amethyst says: "Bye~ music man!"
Greg waves back and leaves the area. Rose looks at the T-shirt, smiling, when an envious Pearl barges in.
Pearl says: "I can sing!"
Rose smiles, and Garnet and Amethyst begin to laugh.
Pearl says: "*blushes* What?"
Time Skip — Later that night.
It starts to rain, as Marty drives Greg's van, with Greg in the back, out of Beach City.
Marty says: "Man, Greg, you really missed out."
Marty says: "Vidalia's friends were wild and crazy."
Marty says: "Glad that town wasn't a total waste."
Greg says: "I met some wild ladies too."
Marty says: "Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, save the poetry for Empire City, Star Child."
Marty says: "We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow."
Greg says: "I'm serious, Marty."
Greg says: "Something's goin' on back there."
Marty says: "Are you nuts?"
Marty says: "Just wait 'till you see what's ahead of us."
Marty says: "It's FAME!"
Marty says: "*presses the 'Play' button on the car radio, but nothing happens* Hey, what's jammed in your tape deck?"
Marty says: "You been putting pennies in here, you weirdo?"
Marty says: "Play something for me, Star Child."
Greg says: "*obediently strums his guitar and begins to sing* ♫ Do you believe in destiny?"
Marty says: "Snore!"
Marty says: "You're gonna put people to sleep with that."
Marty says: "Where's the schlock coming from?"
Greg says: "*blushes* I-I just can't stop thinking about that woman at the show."
Marty says: "Oh, here we go, how big was she?"
Greg says: "Eight feet tall..."
Greg says: "massive hair..."
Marty says: "See, Greg, this is your problem."
Marty says: "You want one huge woman, when you could have multiple small ones."
Greg says: "Ugh, Marty, women are people."
Marty says: "Just follow my lead."
Marty says: "I'm gonna get you everything you want."
Greg says: "What if I want to go back?"
Marty says: "What?!"
Marty says: "!"
Greg says: "What if I want to go back and be with her?!"
Greg says: "!"
Marty says: "No one cares about your feelings, Greg!"
Marty says: "*turns to Greg in anger, letting go of the steering wheel* They're making you lose sight of what's really important!"
Greg says: "WATCH THE ROAD!"
Headlights become visible in the windshield of the car as a truck approaches. Marty quickly swerves the van out of the way and stops it beside a billboard.
Greg says: "*breathing deeply* Why do you always decide what's important?"
Marty says: "Because I'm your manager, and you're just some spaced out kid."
Marty says: "I'm taking you to the city, and you're gonna play, and you're gonna like it."
Marty says: "Maybe you'll even make me some money for once."
Greg says: "*starts to get angry* Get out of my van."
Marty says: "Sit down, Greg."
Greg says: "*yells* I said..."
Greg says: "GET OUTTA MY VAN!"
Greg kicks Marty out of the van onto the rainy roadside, and drive off.
Marty says: "What are you doing?"
Marty says: "You're making a HUGE mistake!"
Greg, driving recklessly, drives back to Beach City and runs over the fence surrounding the Crystal Temple. He runs up to the temple entrance and knocks on the Temple Gate.
Greg says: "Hey, are you in there?"
Greg says: "I can play for you now!"
Greg says: "I even revamped my awesome set!"
Greg runs and jumps onto the warp pad, and prepares to play his guitar.
Greg says: "This one's for you, mystery woman!"
Greg says: "*starts to sing "Destiny"* ♫ Do you believe in destiny?"
Greg says: "/ Close your eyes and leave the rest to me."
Greg says: "/ Do you believe in fantasy?"
Greg says: "/ I have to when it's right in front of me."
Greg says: "/ Oh, what are you doing here, / in the real world?"
Greg says: "/ What are you doing here, / so close I could touch you."
Greg says: "/ What are you doing here, / And what are you doing to me?!"
Greg says: "!"
A bright pink light shines upon Greg as the temple gate opens, and Rose steps out, wearing the T-shirt Greg gave her.
Greg says: "Ah!"
Greg says: "You're wearing the..."
Greg says: "shirt."
Rose says: "*visibly worried*..."
Rose says: "Please, go away."
Greg says: "*blushes* I'm sorry."
Greg says: "Did I--?"
Rose says: "*sighs* You're awfully cute..."
Rose says: "and I really wanna play with you, but your life is short and you have dreams."
Rose says: "I won't let you give up on everything you want."
Greg says: "That's gonna be a problem."
Rose says: "Huh?"
Greg says: "*looks up and smiles* You're everything I want!"
Rose turns starry-eyed and starts giggling in joy. The flashback then ends, returning to present-day Greg and Steven.
Greg says: "What are you smiling about?"
Steven says: "*grins* ♫ You loved her!"
Greg says: "Come here, you!"
Greg says: "*reaches out to tickle Steven, causing him to laugh, and ruffles his hair* Nrrgh!"
Steven says: "*picks up the photo of Greg and Marty* Man, Marty was the worst!"
Greg says: "Oh, yeah, he was awful."
Greg says: "*takes the photo from Steven* But I guess I owe him a lot."
Greg says: "He made it easy for me to stay."
Steven says: "I'm glad he did."
Greg says: "*places the photo next to the picture of him and Rose* Yeah, me too."
The star iris zooms in on the photo of Greg and Marty, ending the episode.
END.
