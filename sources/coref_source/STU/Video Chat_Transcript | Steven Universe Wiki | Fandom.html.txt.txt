Open Int. Steven's Room.
Steven is seen calling Peridot through "Videophone" on a laptop.
Peridot says: "Hello?"
Steven says: "Hi, Peridot!"
Peridot says: "Steven, can you hear me?"
Peridot says: "CAN YOU HEAR ME?!"
Peridot says: "!"
Peridot fiddles with her tablet to increase the volume, while she grumbles loudly in frustration.
Peridot says: "How do I work this stupid thing?"
Peridot says: "Ahh!"
Peridot says: "Steven?"
Steven says: "Hi, Peridot!"
Peridot says: "Steven!"
Peridot says: "*laughs* Behold my resourceful genius!"
Peridot says: "I figured out how to get Wi-Fi in the barn."
Peridot shows Steven an active lawnmower outside the barn, remodeled into a modem.
Peridot says: "The connection is fast enough to stream "Camp Pining Hearts" in all 1,080 p's!"
Peridot says: "It took me a while, but let me tell you how I did it."
Peridot's transmission begins glitching out.
Steven says: "Peridot?"
The transmission continues to glitch, as the signal gets interrupted with squealing noises.
Steven says: "Peridot, you're breaking up."
Peridot says: "..."
The transmission glitches again.
Peridot says: "And then it bit me!"
The transmission glitches once more.
Peridot says: "And now the Wi-Fi works perfectly."
Peridot says: "What did you do today?"
Steven says: "I learned how to do this."
Steven does the "rubber pencil" trick for Peridot to see.
Peridot says: "Whaaaat!"
Peridot says: "?"
Peridot says: "Lapis, get over here."
Lapis says: "Is that..."
Lapis says: "Steven?"
Peridot says: "Yes."
Lapis says: "Oh, no!"
Lapis says: "Steven, what happened?!"
Lapis says: "!"
Steven says: "Oh, you guys, it's fine."
Lapis says: "How did he get trapped in there?!"
Lapis says: "!"
Lapis says: "Why aren't you doing something?!"
Lapis says: "!"
Peridot says: "Lapis, relax."
Peridot says: "It's just my communication pad."
Lapis snatches Peridot's tablet.
Lapis says: "Who did this to you?!"
Lapis says: "!"
Lapis says: "Steven, I'll get you out of there!"
Lapis says: "Where's your gem on this thing?"
Steven says: "Lapis?"
Lapis says: "I can't find it!"
Peridot says: "What?"
Lapis says: "He must be inside!"
Peridot says: "It's just a screen!"
The transmission from Peridot's end suddenly cuts away.
Steven says: "Oh geez!"
Steven crawls away out of his room, when Peridot's transmission returns.
Peridot says: "Oh, thank the stars."
Peridot says: "I thought you were a goner."
Lapis says: "Step aside, Peridot."
Lapis says: "I have to free him."
Peridot says: "Lapis, no!"
Lapis says: "*wielding a baseball bat* I'll save you Steven!"
Lapis says: "I'll save you like you saved me!"
Peridot says: "Calm down!"
Steven then comes running into the Barn.
Steven says: "Wait!"
Steven says: "Stop!"
Steven says: "I'm fine!"
Lapis says: "Steven!"
Lapis says: "You're okay!"
Lapis says: "Oh, sorry, Peridot."
Peridot says: "It's okay."
Peridot says: "Just take it easy with that bat."
Just then, Lion's legs appear on the laptop's end of the video chat.
Steven says: "Aww look."
Steven says: "It's Lion."
Steven says: "W-Wait, Lion."
Steven says: "Lion, be careful!"
Steven says: "Lion, no!"
Lion knocks the laptop out of Steven's room, causing the connection to end.
Steven says: "Noooo!"
Steven says: "*runs frantically out of the Barn* That was Connie's laptop!"
Steven says: "LION!"
Lapis says: "He should really be more careful with other people's stuff."
Peridot says: "*unamused* Hmm..."
Peridot ends the call as well.
END.
