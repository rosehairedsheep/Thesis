The episode opens with the faces of Garnet, Pearl and Amethyst, and a scribble on a chalkboard reading "The Crystal Gems", before the "Crystal" is replaced with "Classroom".
Altogether says: "The Classroom Gems!"
Garnet breaks the title card with her rocket gauntlet, as she stands before a chalkboard with "Special Lesson" written on it.
Garnet says: "*yelling* Hello, this is Garnet!"
Garnet says: "And today, I'm gonna be teaching you about fusion!"
A lens flare shimmers from Garnet's visors, and the scene transition to Garnet, Pearl and Amethyst dancing in a dance studio.
Garnet says: "A fusion is made when two or more Gems combine into one, like me."
Garnet unfuses into Ruby and Sapphire, and they start dancing too.
Pearl says: "Fusion is very difficult to do."
Pearl says: "Gems must be in perfect sync physically, mentally, and emotionally."
Ruby and Sapphire fuse back into Garnet, while Pearl and Amethyst fuse into Opal.
Garnet says: "*takes off her visors* The new forms have extra body parts, and the combined heights and strengths of the fusers, but fusion is hard for Gems that have trouble collaborating."
Opal quickly unfuses back into Pearl and Amethyst, both angry at each other.
Pearl says: "I'm great at collaborating!"
Amethyst says: "*folds arms* Yeah, right."
Pearl and Amethyst begin fuming in anger.
Garnet says: "But I get along fine."
Garnet flicks on a screen, showing a montage of various fusions, such as Opal, Sugilite, Alexandrite and Stevonnie.
Garnet says: "There are many reasons to fuse."
Steven says: "*raises his hand* Yeah, but, what's the best reason to fuse?"
The screen poofs away as the Gems turn to look at Steven.
Garnet says: "Hmm..."
Garnet says: "That's easy."
Garnet says: "The best reason is..."
Garnet picks Pearl and Amethyst up and twirls them around, as the three of them fuse in...
Alexandrite says: "*posing* Love!"
The school bell rings as the words "Class Dismissed!" are shown.
END.
