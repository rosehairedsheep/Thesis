Open Ext. It's a Wash.
Greg is washing a van modeled in the image of Mayor Dewey with Steven.
Greg says: "Almost done!"
Greg says: "*sprays the van with a hose* Steven, get the hubcaps!"
Steven says: "Hubbing it up!"
Greg says: "Hub it good!"
Greg says: "This is a high-profile job."
Steven says: "You mean cause it's the mayor's election-mobile?"
Greg says: "If we do this right, we might get political favors!"
Steven says: "I'm not sure what that is..."
Steven says: "but I like it!"
Steven turns on the hose to spray the van, but the water arches over the van and splashes onto Greg by mistake. Greg laughs and sprays back at Steven with his hose, starting a water fight. Mayor Dewey then walks in towards them.
Mayor Dewey says: "Hey, hey, hey!"
Mayor Dewey says: "I'm not paying for father-son bonding here!"
Mayor Dewey says: "UNIVERSE!"
Mayor Dewey says: "Control that kid."
Greg says: "Steven!"
Greg says: "*holds Steven close to him* Hehe, I'm sorry, Mayor Dewey."
Greg says: "Hehehe, this one's on the house."
Mayor Dewey says: "*examining his van* On the house, eh?"
Mayor Dewey says: "I like the way you do business, Universe."
Mayor Dewey gets into the van and drives off, with a siren chanting "Mayor Dewey". Greg sighs in dismay.
Steven says: "*wiggles his fingers* Political favors!"
Greg says: "Ahh, you rascal!"
Greg says: "*picks Steven up and noogies him* Enough with the hose fights!"
Steven says: "Aw, okay."
Steven and Greg are suddenly splashed by some water.
Greg says: "What the?"
Steven and Greg notices a purple cat holding a running hose in its mouth.
Steven says: "Woah!"
Greg says: "Woah!"
The purple cat starts chasing them around, continuously spraying them with the hose.
Greg says: "What is with this cat?!"
Greg says: "!"
The purple cat begins to shapeshift, revealing to be Amethyst.
Amethyst says: "Haha!"
Amethyst says: "Got you guys!"
Steven says: "Amethyst!"
Greg says: "Uh, pretty cool, Amethyst."
Steven says: "Really cool!"
Steven says: "I wish I could shapeshift like you!"
Amethyst says: "*ties hose into a knot* You could probably learn."
Steven says: "Really?"
Amethyst says: "Sure."
Amethyst says: "*lifts up Steven's shirt* You've got a gem."
Greg says: "Whup!"
Greg says: "Magic stuff!"
Greg says: "Should I get out of here?"
Greg says: "Is there going to be an explosion?"
Steven says: "Aw, it's no big deal, dad."
Amethyst says: "*shapeshifts into Steven* Yeah, it's fiinnneeee."
Greg says: "Gah!"

Amethyst says: "*shapeshifts into a seal, * Arp, arp!"
Steven says: "*laughing* Do more!"
Amethyst says: "Check it out."
Amethyst says: "*shapeshifts into a wolf, while Pearl stares blankly* Aawwooo!"
Amethyst says: "*shapeshifts into a wrestler* Raaa!"
Amethyst says: "*shapeshifts into a jay* Gaah!"
Steven says: "Whoa!"
Pearl says: "*walks over* Amethyst, you're overdoing it."
Amethyst says: "Uh, chill-it dude."
Pearl says: "Just because you can shapeshift, doesn't mean you should."
Steven says: "Can you shapeshift?"
Amethyst says: "*shapeshifts into Pearl and interrupts Pearl* Well of course I can, I'm perfect!"
Amethyst says: "*smacking her butt* WOMP!"
Amethyst says: "WOMP!"
Pearl shoves Amethyst to the side and Amethyst tumbles away laughing.
Pearl says: "All Gems have shapeshifting powers, Steven."
Pearl says: "*projects some holograms* We can turn into objects, we can change parts of our bodies or..."
Pearl says: "we could do that."
Amethyst says: "*still smacking her butt* WOMP!"
Amethyst says: "WOMP!"
Steven says: "I want to try it all!"
Pearl says: "Don't bite off more than you can chew, Steven."
Amethyst says: "WOMP, WOMP!"
Pearl says: "Ugh!"
Steven says: "Alright!"
Steven says: "Show me how to change into a, uh, huge lion!"
Amethyst says: "Actually, for once Pearl is right."
Amethyst says: "If you're gonna do this, you've gotta start with something easy."
Steven says: "Like that cat you turned into?"
Amethyst says: "That sounds good."
Amethyst says: "Now follow my lead."
Amethyst says: "*begins demonstrating for Steven* First, think of what you wanna be, and then, just shake it out."
Amethyst says: "*shapeshifts into the cat* See?"
Amethyst says: "Haha!"
Amethyst says: "Now your turn."
Steven says: "Okay."
Steven says: "*take a deep breath and starts straining himself* Caaatttt..."
Steven says: ".."
Steven says: "!"
Amethyst says: "Nah, you're too tense."
Amethyst says: "*opens a bag of chips* Just relax and feel it."
Amethyst says: "*eats a potato chip* Bio-rhythms, yo."
Steven says: "*presses fingertips against his temples* Feeeelll iittt..."
Steven says: ".."
Amethyst says: "Ehh, if you're not ready, we can try later."
Steven says: "No, wait!"
Steven says: "I can do it."
Steven says: "Yeah..."
Steven says: "yeah..."
Steven says: "HUH!"
Amethyst says: "Well, it was a good try."
A meowing noise appears out of nowhere. Steven opens his palm to see his index finger has turned into a head of a cat, meowing away. Amethyst starts giggling.
Steven says: "This is so cool!"
Amethyst says: "You should go show your dad."
Amethyst says: "He's gonna FREAK OUT!"
Cat Finger says: "Rreow!"
Trans. Ext. It's a Wash.
Steven says: "Dad, I'm back!"
Greg says: "*is suntanning outside* Hey, schtu-ball."
Steven says: "Check it out!"
Steven shows the cat finger to his dad. Greg reacts in shock, hurling a water bottle which hits Steven on the head. Water splashes from the bottle onto the cat finger and it cowers, as if it got burned.
Steven says: "I shapeshifted my finger into a cat!"
Greg says: "Whoa!"
Greg says: "Is, is that a thing you can do now?"
Greg says: "That's pretty..."
Greg says: "cool."
Steven says: "I know, right!"
Steven says: "I'm gonna take this show on the road!"
Cat Finger says: "Meow!"
Cat Finger says: "Row!"
Cat Finger says: "Reaw!"

Steven says: "Mm, okay."
Steven says: "Here's a nickel."
Steven says: "And a buck!"
Sadie says: "Whaaat?!"
Lars says: "Whaaat?!"
Sadie says: "!"
Lars says: "!"
The cat finger drops the dollar bill and meows.
Sadie says: "Oh Steven, that's adorable!"
Sadie says: "*pets the cat finger with her finger, making it purr* Are..."
Sadie says: "you making it purr?"
Steven says: "It kinda does what it wants."
Lars says: "Really?"
Lars says: "*roughly pokes the cat finger, and it bites him* YOW!"
Steven says: "See what I mean?"
Steven says: ""Bad cat finger!"
Sadie says: "Oh, I'm sure it just wants to play."
Steven says: "*gasps* You're right!"
Steven says: "And he doesn't have any friends."
Lars says: "*mockingly* Oh my gosh."
Lars says: "It's just like you, Steven."
Steven takes a deep breath, sways a bit and conjures four more cat fingers on the same palm.
Steven says: "Huh haa!"
Cat Fingers says: "Rraaooow!"

Mr. Fryman says: "What the?!"
Mr. Fryman says: "!"

Trans. Ext. Steven's House.
Steven says: "I wanna go on the Gem Sloop!"
Steven says: "I wanna see a living island!"

Steven says: "Wait, wait!"
Steven runs into the water to catch up to the Gems sailing away on the Gem Sloop.
Pearl says: "Steven!"
Amethyst says: "*laughs* C'mon, you can make it!"
Steven dunks his hands into the water to swim, but the cat fingers start meowing in agitation. The Gems gasp.
Pearl says: "Steven, what's going on?"
Steven says: "Waah!"
Steven says: "I-it's nothing!"
Steven says: "I-i just turned all my fingers into cats!"
Pearl says: "We have to stay and help Steven!"
Garnet says: "We can't."
Garnet says: "This is a tectonic emergency."
Garnet says: "We'll deal with Steven when we get back."
Pearl says: "Amethyst, I blame YOU- for this."

Trans. Ext. It's a Wash.
Greg says: "*washing the floor with a hose while singing along to his headphone music, when he hears a bang* Hello?"
Greg says: "Who's there?"
Greg says: "We're closed, come back tomoroo- WOOHOHOOO!!"
Greg notices Steven, now an amalgam of cats, and sprays at him in fright. The amalgam flinches, but crawls back towards Greg.
Steven says: "*hardly audible* DAD!"
Greg says: "Huh?"
Greg says: "*sees Steven's face among the cats and gasps* Steven?"
Steven says: "Dad!"
Steven says: "*starts tearing* Help!"
Steven says: "Eeeeer!!"

Steven says: "No!"
Steven says: "Bad!"
Steven says: "Bad cat fingers!"
Greg says: "Can't you make them go away?"
Steven says: "I tried, but it made it worse!"
Steven says: "Ohh, my life is over!"
Steven says: "I can't go on magic adventures!"
Steven says: "I can't even open the fridge!"
Steven says: "And I'll never get to have another water fight with you, Dad!"
Steven says: "Because these things hate..."
Steven says: "Water!"
Steven says: "They hate water!"
Steven says: "Dad, spray me again!"
Greg sprays Steven with the hose and the cats jump down of the building. They then start dashing towards Greg.
Greg says: "Aaah!!"
Greg says: "WOOOAAAHH!!!!"
Steven grabs onto the side of the car wash, preventing the cats from reaching Greg.
Steven says: "It's not enough water!"
Steven says: "*looks inside the car wash and gasps* Turn on the super-wash!"
Greg says: "No, I won't do it!"
Greg says: "It's too dangerous!"
Steven says: "You've got to!"
Steven says: "I'm a monster!"
Steven says: "I'm an adorable cat monster!"
Greg says: "*starts tearing up* No you're not!"
Greg says: "You're my son!"
Steven says: "Dad!"
Steven says: "Please!"
Steven says: "AAH!"
Trans. Int. It's a Wash.
Greg, determined, flips three switches and presses a button, activating the super-wash. Steven then crawls into the car wash. The jets spray Steven with water on all sides, causing the cats to meow in agitation. He then goes through a pair of waxers and another set of jets. Greg watches worriedly as Steven goes through the wash. He then rushes to the exit of the car wash and picks up a hose, ready to spray off any remaining cats. Steven then emerges from the wash, his clothes all torn up, but back to normal.
Greg says: "Ah!"
Steven says: "Dad."
Steven says: "We did it."
Steven realizes one of his fingers is still a cat and starts screaming. Greg screams too and sprays it with the hose. The cat finger disappears, and the two sighs in relief.
Trans. Ext. Beach House.
Steven is sitting on the dock, and the Gems returns on the Gem Sloop.
Pearl says: "Steven!"
Pearl says: "*climbs onto the dock and examines his hand* Okay, let me see it."
Pearl says: "Whe-?"
Pearl says: "Y-you got them to go away."
Pearl says: "It just goes to show, always listen to me, and NEVER listen to Amethyst."
Amethyst says: "That's fair."
Garnet says: "It goes to show, you should have a little more faith in Steven."
Steven says: "Yeah, that would have been a total CAT-tastrophe!"
Amethyst and Pearl forces a laugh.
Steven says: "But I'm feeling much better MEOW!"
The Gems groan.
Steven says: "Ehhh?"
Steven says: "What's the matter?"
Steven says: "Cat got your tongue?"
Garnet says: "Okay, that's enough."
Steven says: "Wait, I've been coming up with cat jokes all morning."
Steven says: "You guys, I'm FELINE fine."
Steven says: "Everything's PURRfect!"
Steven says: "Oh come on!"
Steven says: "I'm just KITTEN around!"
