Open Atop Brooding Hill, Night-time.
Following the events in "What's Your Problem?", Amethyst and Steven find Ruby, sitting next to Greg by his van.
Steven says: "Ruby!"
Amethyst says: "Oh boy..."
Amethyst says: "So she's all the way out here..."
Steven says: "After everything Sapphire said, she must be heartbroken."
Amethyst and Steven proceed to walk up to Ruby and Greg.
Steven says: "Hey guys!"
Ruby says: "Steven?"
Ruby says: "How'd you find me?"
Amethyst says: "We sensed you..."
Amethyst says: "!"
Steven says: "We..."
Steven says: "heard you ordered pizza."
Greg says: "Ruby was just telling me about your mom."
Steven says: "Oh..."
Steven says: "Are you okay?"
Greg says: "Well, I fell in love with Rose Quartz, and she fell in love with Mr."
Greg says: "Universe."
Greg says: "Sure, she never told me she used to be Pink Diamond, but, heh, I never told her I used to be Gregory DeMayo."
Steven says: "So..."
Steven says: "How are you holding up, Ruby?"
Ruby says: "I'm okay!"
Ruby says: "*holds up a box of pizza to Steven* Want a slice?"
Steven says: "Uh..."
Steven says: "Thank you..."
Steven says: "*takes a pizza slice* Wait, really?"
Steven says: "You seemed so sad before."
Ruby says: "Yeah, but, me and Greg talked it out."
Ruby says: "I'm fine now."
Steven says: "Are you sure?"
Amethyst takes Steven's pizza slice off his hand.
Ruby says: "Yeah."
Ruby says: "Sapphire was kinda right about everything."
Ruby says: "We really did stay Garnet because Rose told us to be her..."
Ruby says: "Uh..."
Ruby says: "'answer'."
Ruby says: "It's my first time thinking about it..."
Ruby says: "It's my first time really thinking about..."
Ruby says: "me!"
Steven says: "What do you mean?"
Ruby says: "Back when I emerged, the first thing I did was get crammed together with a bunch of other Rubies!"
Ruby says: "Then..."
Ruby says: "I was with Sapphire all the time."
Ruby says: "I was always checking in on someone."
Ruby says: "But now..."
Ruby says: "I can go wherever the wind takes me!"
Ruby grabs three pizza slices and three comic books in each hand.
Ruby says: "I'm up here, eating pizza, reading comics!"
Ruby says: "I don't know if Sapphire wants to read comics."
Ruby says: "I don't have to know!"
Ruby throws the items on the ground and somersaults onto the roof of the Greg's van.
Ruby says: "The rest of my life could be like this!"
Ruby says: "I don't have to be Garnet..."
Ruby says: "I can be on my own!"
Greg says: "Sure!"
Amethyst says: "I guess."
Steven says: "*shocked* Whhhaaaaat?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "B-But you guys love each other!"
Steven says: "You're my favorite couple!"
Steven says: "You're- You're like sugar and flour, I- I love eating them separately, but I still want cake!"
Ruby says: "*halts Steven* I'm not fussed about what Sapphire wants!"
Ruby says: "I've seen my own future now."
Ruby says: "And it's nothin' but Ruby!"
Steven silently starts freaking out.
Greg says: "Relax, kiddo."
Greg says: "This could be what she needs."
Steven says: "But, Dad!"
Steven says: "What if they never form Garnet again?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "We gotta get them back together!"
Greg says: "Woah..."
Greg says: "Tha-That's not our call to make!"
Greg says: "Ruby's gotta want that for herself!"
Greg says: "If that's not what Ruby wants, then it's not what Garnet wants, right?"
Steven says: "Mmm..."
Steven says: "Ugh, I guess so..."
Ruby begins jumping up and down on the van in enthusiasm.
Amethyst says: "So..."
Amethyst says: "Where you going after this, dude?"
Amethyst says: "You just gonna stay out here?"
Ruby says: "I wanna live free!"
Ruby says: "One with the wilderness!"
Ruby says: "Facing danger in every turn!"
Ruby says: "Not leaving nothin' or nobody to get me by!"
Ruby says: "Just like..."
Ruby says: "this guy!"
Ruby holds up a comic book titled "Dolphin Tail".
Steven says: "Hmm."
Steven says: "Do you mean..."
Steven says: "something like this?"
Steven shows Ruby another comic called "Lonesome Lasso". Ruby jumps down from the van and takes the comic book.
Ruby says: "*gasps* That's even better!"
Ruby says: "The open plains, that's where I wanna go!"
Greg says: "I think I know just the place."
Greg says: "I'll get ya there."
Ruby says: "Thank you!!"
Steven says: "Alright, alright, if this is how it's gotta be."
Steven says: "I'll support Ruby in her quest for emotional growth."
Ruby says: "*making finger-guns atop Greg's van* Yee-haw!"
Ruby says: "Pa-pow, pa-pow!"
Ruby says: "Bang bang bang!"
Ruby says: "Woo-hoo!!"
Trans. Open Range, The Next Day.
Greg drives Ruby, Steven and Amethyst to an open outdoor range.
Greg says: "Y'all ready to wild west it up?"
Ruby kicks the back doors of the van open, revealing to be dressed like a cowboy, and jumps out. She pulls the Lonesome Lasso comic from under her hat and begins to read.
Ruby says: ""Here I am, on the open range..."
Ruby says: "At least you understand me, horsey."
Steven says: "Oh, Ruby, you need a steed!"
Amethyst says: "I'm always down for a little..."
Amethyst says: "horsin around."
Amethyst grunts loudly as she begins to shapeshift into a horse, and neighs proudly.
Amethyst says: "Giddy-up."
Ruby begins riding on Amethyst's back and treads into the open range, while Steven and Greg follow behind.
Greg says: "How's it goin', Ruby?"
Greg says: "Feel like a real cowboy now?"
Ruby says: "Yep."
Ruby says: "I sure reckon I do."
Steven says: "Sorry I gotta be a yellow-belly about this, but we don't even have a map."
Steven says: "I think we're just gonna get ourselves lost."
Amethyst snorts.
Ruby says: "I already am lost."
Ruby says: "That's why I came out here; to find myself."
The group comes to a hedge that blocks their way.
Amethyst says: "It's a dead end."
Ruby says: "*dismounts Amethyst* This is what I mean."
Ruby says: "What's behind this brush..."
Ruby says: "I dunno!"
Ruby says: "Sapphire ain't here to predict for me."
Ruby says: "It's my chance to find out for myself!"
Ruby crawls into the hedge, and then screams loudly.
Steven says: "Oh jiminy!"
Steven says: "Ruby?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven peeks through the hedge to find Ruby standing on a cliff ledge, breathing quickly and looking down at a deep ravine.
Ruby says: "Whoa!!"
Ruby says: "I had no idea this ravine was here."
Ruby jumps up to the other side of the cliff.
Ruby says: "I almost fell down there."
Ruby says: "And, it was all my choice!"
Ruby says: "Yee-haw!!"
Ruby says: "Independence!"
Steven smiles nervously as Ruby runs around, laughing and cheering herself. A montage begins to play, of Ruby being a cowboy, while she sings "Ruby Rider".
Ruby voiceover.
Ruby continues riding on Amethyst into the evening, while Greg drives his van behind. Ruby then attempts to lasso a bull on the range and succeeds, but the bull begins chasing the group in agitation.
Ruby v.o.
The group encounters a rattlesnake and Ruby decides to have a showdown with it. She glares at it, points a finger-gun at it and succeeds in scaring it away. Night quickly falls, Ruby lights up a campfire, picks up a guitar and continues to sing.
Ruby says: "♪ I used to think I, ♪ Would always be by your side."
Ruby says: "♪ But lately you’ve been rather cold."
As Ruby sings, Greg, Steven and Amethyst harmonize with her.
Ruby says: "♪ One look in your eye, ♪ Could make an honest Gem cry."
Ruby says: "♪ But Ruby Rider don’t need no one to hold."
Ruby sits atop a rock and begins whistling her song, while strumming the guitar.
Steven says: "Wow."
Steven says: "Ruby's really getting into this."
Greg says: "Seriously!"
Greg says: "I just taught her how to play guitar like, ten minutes ago!"
Steven says: "No Dad, I mean the whole "cowboy-being-alone" thing."
Steven says: "I've never seen her like this before..."
Steven says: "She seems really..."
Steven says: "happy."
Ruby says: "♪ This ol' Ruby rider, ♪ Is Ruby ridin' alone."
Time-Skip.
Greg and Amethyst are fast asleep, Greg is snoring loudly while Amethyst whinnies in her sleep. Steven, in his caterpillar sleeping bag, looks up at Ruby, who is still sitting atop the rock.
Steven says: "Hey, Ruby."
Ruby says: "Hmm?"
Steven says: "Y'know..."
Steven says: "I got really scared when you said you didn't want to fuse with Sapphire any more."
Steven says: "I felt like I was losing someone I cared about."
Steven says: "But I saw how much fun you were having today."
Steven says: "All this buckaroo-ing really suits you."
Steven says: "I'm sorry I tried to push you back into being Garnet."
Ruby says: "It's..."
Ruby says: "not true..."
Steven says: "Huh?"
Ruby says: "That stuff I sang about..."
Ruby says: "It's not true..."
Ruby says: "!"
Steven says: "W-What?!"
Steven says: "!"
Ruby says: "I mean, I did have a lot of fun today; I loved it!"
Ruby says: "But..."
Ruby says: "the whole time, I..."
Ruby says: "I kept thinkin' about how much more fun I'd have if I were with her."
Ruby says: "Sapphire was always there with me."
Ruby says: "I feel her smile just like it was mine."
Ruby says: "It's so lonely now..."
Ruby says: "Gaaah!"
Ruby leans backwards and slides down the rock, landing on her head with her arms crossed in annoyance.
Ruby says: "That's lame, right?!"
Ruby says: "!"
Ruby says: "I came here to be my own gem, but, I'm still thinkin' about what she'd like!"
Ruby says: "What'd she want!"
Ruby says: "All, the time!"
Ruby says: "*flops over* Turns out, I'm no good at not needin' nobody."
Steven says: "C'mon, that's not lame."
Steven says: "You led us on a frontier adventure!"
Steven says: "You're still the same Ruby who did all that stuff, even if you're thinking of someone."
Steven says: "Look at our friend Lonesome Lasso."
Steven picks up the Lonesome Lasso comic book and walks to Ruby.
Steven says: "They call him that 'cause he's lonesome!"
Steven says: ""I miss Sally May!"
Steven says: "" He's still a rootin'-tootin' cowboy, blazin' his own trails."
Steven says: "But, he loves someone too."
Ruby says: "*blushes and gazes up to the sky* Well, if I'm making my own decisions..."
Ruby says: "Then, I'll decide I wanna be with Sapphire."
Ruby says: "*sighs and gets up* I mean, I've gotta ask her first."
Ruby says: "I just don't want it to feel like we're going back to how things used to be; back when someone else told us to be together."
Ruby says: "I want it to feel different..."
Steven says: "Wait a sec!"
Steven says: "*flips through the comic book* What do you think of this?"
Steven shows Ruby a page of the comic, and she gasps and grins in delight.
Trans. Int. Beach House, The Next Day.
Pearl and Sapphire are seen sitting on the couch, still troubled over Ruby's departure, when Steven enters the house.
Sapphire says: "Steven!"
Sapphire says: "Did you find Ruby?"
Steven says: "She's outside."
Steven says: "She's got something to say to you."
Sapphire, Steven and Pearl step out onto the porch, when they see Ruby and Amethyst standing on the beach in the sunrise.
Sapphire says: "Ruby!"
Sapphire quickly runs off the porch and up to Ruby.
Sapphire says: "Ruby, I'm so sorry!"
Sapphire says: "I should have never said those awful things to you."
Sapphire says: "That we didn't matter any more; I shouldn't have pushed you away like that."
Sapphire says: "I was wrong."
Ruby spits away the wheat grass she is chewing out of her mouth.
Ruby says: "Pt'ooey!"
Ruby says: "Naw, you were right."
Sapphire reacts in shock as Ruby jumps off of Amethyst's back. She pats Amethyst's side, signalling her to run off, and approaches Sapphire.
Ruby says: "Someone else told us we were the answer."
Ruby says: "But..."
Ruby says: "I don't believe that anymore."
Ruby says: "At least, not 'til I hear it from you."
Ruby holds out her hand to Sapphire. Sapphire takes her hand, and Ruby kneels before her, as a wind blows away her cowboy hat.
Ruby says: "Sapphire..."
Ruby says: "Will you marry me?"
Sapphire says: "What?"
Sapphire says: "*chuckles* Marry you?"
Ruby says: "Yeah!"
Ruby says: "This way we can be together, even when we're apart!"
Ruby says: "This time, being Garnet will be our decision."
Ruby says: "What do you say?"
Sapphire says: "*smiles* Of course."
Ruby says: "Yee-haw!"
Ruby says: "Mmmm..."
Ruby says: "!"
Sapphire says: "I've been waiting to kiss your cute face!"
Sapphire kisses Ruby on her cheek. Ruby lifts Sapphire up and spins her around, and they begin laughing together in joy.
Steven says: "AWWWW!"
Steven and Pearl watch on the romantic scene on the porch, when Amethyst approaches from behind, startling Pearl.
Amethyst says: "Psst, it's me."
Amethyst says: "I'm a horse."
Pearl smiles and places her hand on Amethyst's mane. Ruby continues twirling and throwing Sapphire up in the air and catching her in sheer happiness, as Steven holds up the final page of the Lonesome Lasso comic book, showing a wedding scene and reading "To be continued..." in the corner of the page.
END.
