Open Ext. It's a Wash!
Pearl is examining Greg's broken van, while Garnet and Amethyst lean nearby against the building.
Pearl says: "*looking at the engine of the van* Wow."
Pearl says: "Those water constructs really did a number on Greg's van."
Pearl says: "Hmm..."
Amethyst says: "Ah, give it a rest, Pearl."
Amethyst says: "That thing will be busted forever."
Pearl says: "I completely disagree."
Pearl says: "It's just a simple human machine."
Pearl says: "I'm sure that I can figure this whole thing out before you know it!"
Steven says: "Hey guys!"
Steven walks in, as Greg scoots over on a movable chair with a hockey stick, carrying a toolbox.
Greg says: "Zoop!"
Greg says: "I got something that will patch this van up real good!"
Pearl says: "*gasps* Is it some kind of complex human tool?"
Greg says: "Yup, high-quality duct tape!"
Greg says: "*shows Pearl a roll of duct tape* Some well placed duct tape can patch anything up in a pinch, see?"
Pearl says: "I'm sure that I can fix this without your "tape"."
Greg says: "Well, gee, at least let me give you a hand."
Steven says: "Ah!"
Steven says: "Dad, be careful!"
Steven says: "I'm sorry that you hurt your leg and that your van got smashed up because of me."
Greg says: "*pats his head* You apologize too much."
Greg says: "Maybe I shouldn't have tagged along in that crazy adventure."
Greg says: "But at least I got to spend some time with my fave guy!"
Steven says: "What if you stayed with us until you got better?"
Greg says: "Hey, that's a great idea!"
Pearl says: "*quickly interrupts* Yes!"
Amethyst says: "Wait, Steven."
Amethyst says: "Don't you have healing powers now?"
Pearl says: "*smiles nervously* Oh, right, yes!"
Pearl says: "You fix Greg, I'll fix the van."
Pearl says: "*mumbles under her breath* Nobody has to live with us."
Steven says: "*gasp* Yeah!"
Steven says: "Mm-hmm!"
Steven says: "Here goes something new and exciting."
Steven says: "*licks his hand* And..."
Steven says: "go!"
Steven says: "*pats his saliva-covered hand on Greg's broken leg* Okay, you should be better now."
Greg says: "Okay, if you say so."
Steven says: "Why didn't it work?"
Greg says: "Hey, sorry, buddy."
Greg says: "Maybe you just need a little more practice."
Steven says: "But..."
Steven says: "I was doing so well before!"
Pearl says: "Steven, don't worry about it."
Pearl says: "Your powers are a bit fickle, after all."
Garnet says: "Just give it a bit more time."
Greg says: "Cheer up, Steven!"
Greg says: "At least now we get to spend some more time together, right?"
Steven says: "Y-Yeah, right."
Garnet says: "Hmm..."
Pearl says: "Garnet, can you give me a hand?"
Garnet lifts the front of Greg's van up, and the engine of the van falls right through it, startling Steven and Greg.
Steven says: "*surprised* Ahh!"
Trans. Beach House.
Steven and Greg throw some confetti in the air as they begin to engage in some father-and-son quality time, such as cooking breakfast, watching videos on Steven's Phone, Steven washing Greg clean after he spilled soda on himself, and singing "Dear Old Dad" together. After the song, Steven, Greg, and Amethyst are seen making paper airplanes in the living room.
Amethyst says: "Bombs away!"
Amethyst throws her paper airplane in the air and it hits Greg on the nose. The three start to laugh and when Pearl enters from outside, covered in oil from repairing Greg's van. She drops Greg's toolbox and wipes herself clean up, when Garnet appears as well.
Garnet says: "You're back."
Garnet says: "The Geode is cracked, we must leave immediately."
Pearl says: "What?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Amethyst says: "Oh, no!"
Pearl and Amethyst rushes towards the Warp Pad.
Garnet says: "You too, Steven."
Steven says: "*stands up excitedly* Yeah!"
Greg says: "Aw, really?"
Steven says: "Oh!"
Steven says: "Oh yeah."
Greg says: "*frowns* It's okay, Steven, I'll be fine."
Greg says: "You go on your mission."
Steven says: "Are you sure?"
Greg says: "Of course."
Steven says: "Thanks, Dad!"
Steven says: "We'll be back before you know it!"
Greg says: "Okay."
Greg says: "Don't worry about your old man."
Greg says: "My leg's not getting any more broken."
Greg says: "If I need something, I'll just..."
Greg says: "crawl."
Greg says: "*gets teary* My arms are still not..."
Greg says: "broken."
Amethyst says: "Oh, brother."
The Crystal Gems gets off the warp pad and walk towards Greg.
Pearl says: "Now, Greg, there's no need to be so pathetic."
Pearl says: "If anything happens to you, you can call us with this."
Greg says: "*gasps* What is it?"
Garnet says: "It's a Warp Whistle."
Greg says: "*in awe* Warp Whistle..."
Garnet says: "If you blow in it, the warp pad will activate and will alert us that we need to return."
Steven says: "See, Dad?"
Steven says: "You'll be fine."
Greg says: "*sighs* Right, I'll be fine."
Greg says: "Good luck on your mission, son."
Trans. Ent. Geode.
The Crystal Gem warp and arrive at the warp pad outside the Geode, as a lightning storm is brewing over.
Amethyst says: "Man, this place is janked up."
Steven says: "Wow."
Steven says: "Was there an explosion or something?"
Garnet says: "*walks ahead* Almost."
Pearl says: "What you're looking at is a synthetic storm that was contained in—"
A whistling sound is heard out of nowhere, interrupting Pearl's explanation.
Amethyst says: "Is that the Warp Whistle?"
Steven says: "Ah!"
Steven says: "Dad needs me, I'll be right back!"
Steven says: "*warps back to the Beach house* Dad!"
Steven says: "I'm here!"
Steven says: "Is everything..."
Steven says: "?"
Greg says: "Oh, hey, Steven!"
Greg says: "Just making sure that this thing actually works."
Greg says: "Heh."
Steven says: "Okay, we'll be back later!"
Steven says: "*warps back to the Geode* Sorry for the holdup!"
Pearl says: "Is everything okay?"
Amethyst says: "Hey, did Greg fall down and break his butt?"
Amethyst says: "Ha ha!"
Garnet says: "That's not funny."
Amethyst says: "*looks down sadly* I know."
Pearl says: "Like I was saying, this is a synthetic—"
The Warp Whistle is heard for the second time, interrupting Pearl again.
Steven says: "I'm sure it's very important."
Steven says: "*warps back to the Beach house* Dad?"
Greg says: "*scratches back of his head* I'm really sorry, but where's the remote?"
Steven says: "That's actually..."
Steven says: "a very important question."
Steven warps back to the Geode after helping Greg out.
Steven says: "It was very important."
Pearl says: "Okay, so if the Geode breaks, then the storm will be unleashed and our bodies will be vaporized."
Steven says: "Then..."
Steven says: "we'd be dead."
Garnet says: "That's where you come in."
Steven says: "Say what?"
Garnet says: "You should try and seal that crack with your healing powers."
Steven says: "But..."
Steven says: "what if..."
Steven says: "I can't do it?"
Garnet says: "It won't hurt to try."
Steven says: "Okay."
Steven walks toward the Geode, still doubting his power, when he sees the Gems silently cheering him on. He then begins to attempt healing the Geode with a palm covered in his saliva, but nothing happens. He begins to strain himself as the Gems watch in worry.
Steven says: "IT'S NOT WORKING!"
Steven says: "Ugh..."
Steven says: "I knew this would happen."
Steven says: "Just when I thought I was getting better."
Garnet says: "Don't beat yourself up, Steven."
Amethyst says: "Yeah, don't worry about it!"
Pearl says: "We'll find another way!"
Steven says: "Eh."
Steven says: "You don't understand."
Steven says: "How am I supposed to call myself a Crystal Gem, if I can't even—"
The Warp Whistle suddenly sounds again for the third time, this time interrupting Steven. All the Crystal Gems decide to warp back to the Beach House.
Steven says: "Dad?"
Steven says: "Dad?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "Daaad!"
Steven says: "*runs up to his bedroom and see Greg lying in front of his TV* Dad!"
Steven says: "Are you okay?"
Steven says: "Answer me!"
Greg says: "*suddenly wakes up* Steven!"
Greg says: "You just missed..."
Greg says: "the funniest commercial."
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "What?"
Greg says: "*laughs* It was that one for the dog treats where the dog's dressed up like a doctor."
Greg says: "If I ever get heartworms, I'm eating those dog treats."
Steven says: "Dad!"
Steven says: "You're only supposed to use the Warp Whistle for emergencies."
Steven says: "Like if you fell down and broke your butt!"
Greg says: "Ah, haha, yeah..."
Greg says: "Sorry about that."
Steven says: "*sigh* It's okay."
Greg says: "Since you're here, mind grabbing me a snack from the Big Donut?"
Steven says: "Yeah, sure thing."
Steven says: "*climbs down the steps and turns to the Gems* I'll be right back guys."
Garnet says: "We'll be in the temple."
Pearl says: "We have to come up with another plan, quick."
Amethyst says: "Yo, dude, no worries about earlier."
Amethyst says: "You'll get a hold of your powers before ya know it!"
Steven says: "Thanks, Amethyst!"
Amethyst says: "Get me a croissant."
Steven says: "*exits the house* Ah, I forgot to ask Dad what kind of donuts he wants."
Steven says: "Ugh..."
Steven says: "*goes back inside* Hey, Dad, I—"
Steven is alarmed to find Greg at the fridge, searching for food and dancing on his "broken" leg.
Greg says: "Olé!"
Greg says: "*notices Steven* Steven!"
Greg says: "*drops all the food he is carrying* Ha, you had me scared there, son."
Greg says: "Didn't see you..."
Greg says: "standing in the doorway."
Greg says: "Your old man's still got it!"
Steven angrily glares at Greg.
Greg says: "What, this?"
Greg says: "I guess I couldn't wait for those donuts."
Steven crosses his arms, and Greg realizes that Steven is referring to his "broken" leg.
Greg says: "Uhh."
Greg says: "Oh yeah..."
Greg says: "*pretends that his leg still hurts* Ugh..."
Greg says: "Ouch..."
Greg says: "Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!"
Steven says: "Just stop, Dad."
Steven says: "I get what's going on."
Steven says: "Your leg isn't broken at all, is it?"
Greg says: "It was broken, but you healed it back at the car wash."
Steven says: "You lied to me!"
Steven says: "Now I can't do it anymore!"
Greg says: "What?"
Steven says: "The Gems needed me to fix the broken rock, but my healing powers aren't working."
Steven says: "It-it's because of you, you messed with my head!"
Greg says: "No!"
Greg says: "I didn't mean to..."
Greg says: "I just wanted to live with my son again!"
Steven says: "I really thought I was getting better, I finally felt like a Crystal Gem."
Steven says: "Now, what if I can't do..."
Steven says: "anything?"
Greg says: "Steven, don't beat yourself up!"
Greg says: "This is my fault!"
Steven says: "Yeah!"
Steven says: "Yeah it is!"
Steven says: "*runs outside the house* Ughh!"
Steven says: "What am I going to do?"
Steven says: "My powers, they're—"
Steven says: "*sees his ukulele and Greg's guitar nearby, remembers the times they had together, and walks back inside* I'm sorry, I..."
Steven says: "*gasps* Dad!"
Steven sees Greg standing on the warp pad, with the Warp Whistle and his toolbox.
Greg says: "It's time for me to fix the trouble I've caused."
Steven says: "Nooooo!"
Greg blows into the Warp Whistle, activating the warp pad, and warps away. Steven quickly jumps into the warp stream, and both of them warp to the Geode.
Steven says: "Dad, be careful!"
Greg says: "Don't worry, Steven!"
Greg says: "Your old man's gonna- Whoa!"
Steven says: "Daaad!"
Steven says: "*catches up to Greg* Are you okay?"
The lightning storm begin to worsen, as the Geode is unable to contain the storm any longer, generating strong winds and striking lightning everywhere.
Greg says: "Steven, get out of here!"
Greg says: "I'm responsible for this!"
Steven says: "No, you're not."
Greg says: "But, I messed up your powers!"
Greg says: "I did everything I'm not supposed to do, and now you can't heal!"
Steven says: "I healed you, right?"
Greg says: "Hey, get in there and patch things up, just like you patched up your old man!"
Steven says: "*runs up to the Geode* Double..."
Steven says: "healing..."
Steven says: "powers!"
Steven says: "*licks both his hands and pats them on the Geode, but still nothing happens* It's still not working!"
Greg says: "Ah, forget it!"
Greg says: "I've got another idea!"
Greg spread a strip of duct tape over the crack in the Geode, sealing it up. The lightning storm quickly calms and subsides.
Greg says: "There, see, as good as new!"
Trans. Ext. Temple.
The Crystal Gems and Greg are gathered on the beach. Greg is admiring his now-repaired van in awe, looking almost brand new, while Pearl reads a checklist of repairs she performed on the van.
Greg says: "No way."
Pearl says: "So, I've realigned the axles..."
Greg says: "I can't believe it!"
Pearl says: "*continued*..."
Pearl says: "replaced the spark plugs..."
Greg says: "It's never looked this good!"
Pearl says: "*still continued*..."
Pearl says: "sealed the leaks in the intake manifold gaskets, and recalibrated the timing belt."
Pearl says: "As long as you ease up on second gear, your transmission should be fine."
Greg says: "Pearl!"
Greg says: "I can't thank you enough!"
Greg says: "Haha!"
Greg hugs Pearl tightly, as she reacts in disgust. After Greg releases Pearl, she shivers and crawls backwards, hiding behind Garnet.
Greg says: "So, now that I'm feeling better, it's about time that I move back home."
Greg says: "Can't have me messing up more magic stuff."
Greg says: "Just in case you have trouble again..."
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Steven heads to bed for the night, with the roll of duct tape on the nightstand next to him.
Steven says: "Good night, Dad!"
Greg says: "Good night, Steven!"
Trans. Ext. Beach House.
Greg's van is parked on the beach just outside the Beach House, as Greg also turns in for the night. Two heart irises, instead of stars, zoom in on the Beach House and Greg's van, ending the episode.
END.
