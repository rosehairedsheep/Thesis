Steven is drawing a flyer of Greg as "Guitar Dad" in his room with a pencil, and then making the final touches with a red marker.
Steven says: "*picks up the drawing and runs down the steps* PEARL!"
Steven says: "AMETHYST!"
Steven says: "GARNET!"
Steven says: "Uh-ah!"
Steven finds all the Gems are sitting on the couch in the living room.
Pearl says: "*reading a magazine* You don't have to yell, Steven, we're right here."
Steven says: "I know, but I just finished this drawing, and I wanted to show it to you."
Pearl says: "Oh!"
Pearl says: "Uh..."
Pearl says: "Of course."
Steven says: "All right!"
Steven says: "*jumps on Garnet's lap and shows the Gems his flyer* Haha!"
Steven says: ""Guitar Dad teaches you guitar!"
Amethyst says: "What is that?"
Steven says: "It's my dad."
Steven says: "He's going to start teaching guitar lessons and he made me his P."
Steven says: "R."
Steven says: "Department."
Amethyst says: "*points at some crosses on Greg's mouth* What's that stuff in his mouth?"
Steven says: "Those are his teeth."
Pearl says: "What are the lightning bolts for?"
Steven says: "Ugh..."
Steven says: "Well, ah..."
Steven says: "I was trying to show that Dad really rocks on the guitar, and..."
Garnet says: "*points at the flyer* Then there should be rocks falling out of the guitar."
Steven says: "I hear what you're saying, but it's too late for notes..."
Steven says: "this is permanent marker."
Trans. Int. Big Donut.
Steven tapes the flyer on the billboard inside the Big Donut.
Sadie says: "What's that cute flyer for, Steven?"
Steven says: "It's for my dad, he'll teach you guitar, you guys wanna sign up?"
Steven says: "My dad's really good."
Sadie says: "Maybe I'll stop by and check it out."
Steven says: "Here, lemme give you a flyer and—"
The door bell chimes and Buck enters.
Sadie says: "Welcome to the Big Donut."
Steven says: "Hey, Buck."
Lars says: "*surprised* Oh!"
Lars says: "W-what?"
Lars says: "*flaps his arms like a chicken* Buck, Buck, Buuuuuuuuck!"
Lars says: "Haha!"
Lars says: "*takes off his headphones* What's going on man?"
Lars says: "What can we get for you today?"
Buck says: "*looks at the menu, then at the donuts* Can I get a caprese salad?"
Sadie says: "Oh sorry, Buck."
Lars says: "*barges in* DO-NUT worry, Buck!"
Lars says: "I'll whip ya up a salad, no sweat!"
Lars says: "*makes a thumb-up, sweating* I'll be right back."
Sadie says: "Lars!"
Sadie says: "We don't even have vegetables here!"
Buck says: "*looks at Steven's flyer* Heh, what's a "guitar dad"?"
Steven says: "Like my flyer?"
Steven says: "It's for my dad."
Steven says: "*pretends to play a guitar* He'll teach you guitar!"
Steven says: "Here, take one of these with you."
Steven says: "Actually, just wear it."
Buck starts laughing uncontrollably.
Steven says: "Are you ticklish?"
Buck says: "This would make a rad shirt, man."
Steven says: "Really?"
Buck says: "Yeah, let's make your flyer into T-shirts."
Steven says: "Oh man, my dad would love that!"
Buck says: "Gimme five on it."
Steven swings his hand too hard and misses Buck's hand.
Buck says: "Oh, you missed."
Trans. Int. Abandoned Warehouse.
Steven and Buck meet up with Mayor Dewey, who is unloading several boxes of campaign supplies from his van in the warehouse.
Mayor Dewey says: "Ho!"
Mayor Dewey says: "I think it's swell you're returning to the family business, son."
Mayor Dewey says: "Gonna help the old man get re-elected again, eh?"
Mayor Dewey says: "*hugs Buck and pats his head* Aww, son!"
Buck says: "*breaks free* Ugh!"
Buck says: "It's not for campaign stuff, dad."
Buck says: "Steven and I are making art."
Steven says: "*gasps* Art!"
Mayor Dewey says: "Art, huh?"
Mayor Dewey says: "I don't understand it myself, but a boy's gotta have interests and ambitions."
Mayor Dewey says: "*slaps Buck hard on the back, causing his visor to fall off* WOAH-HO-HO-HO!"
Steven says: "*looks around at the supplies and equipment* This stuff can be used to make t-shirts?"
Mayor Dewey says: "Oh yeah, I've got all the latest, state of the art screen-printing equipment from years of campaigning."
Mayor Dewey says: "And other some such, mayorly things."
Mayor Dewey says: "Like this week, I'm commemorating..."
Mayor Dewey says: "a bench!"
Mayor Dewey shows the boys a banner of "Bench City", which is just a banner that reads "Welcome to Beach City", with a "N" written onto the "A" with a marker.
Steven says: ""Welcome to..."
Steven says: "Bench City"?"
Steven says: "Thrifty!"
Buck says: "*moans* Dad, you can't use this."
Mayor Dewey says: "Why not?"
Mayor Dewey says: "You know I "gotta gank dat youth vote, boi"!"
Buck says: "Dad, stop."
Steven goes to open one of the boxes and finds several flyers, similar to Steven's. He takes one out and it reads "Vote for My Dad" with a drawing of Buck and Mayor Dewey holding hands.
Steven says: "What's this?"
Mayor Dewey says: "What have you got there?"
Mayor Dewey says: "*takes the flyer* Aww..."
Mayor Dewey says: "I haven't seen this in years."
Mayor Dewey says: "Remember when you drew this, Buck?"
Mayor Dewey says: "You couldn't wait to show it off to all your li'l Montessori friends."
Buck says: "Okay, dad."
Buck says: "Thanks for all your help, see ya later, bye."
Mayor Dewey says: "Alright, kids."
Mayor Dewey says: "I mean..."
Mayor Dewey says: ""Peace in the Middle-East, Holmes."
Steven says: "*picks up another one of Buck's flyers* So cool."
Buck says: "*quickly grabs and crumples the flyer* Let's just get started already."
Buck and Steven proceed to make multiple copies of T-shirts using the equipment Mayor Dewey provided, with Steven's "Guitar Dad" flyer printed on the T-shirts.
Buck says: "*admires one of the T-shirts* Swag."
Steven says: "Now everyone's gonna want lessons from Dad!"
Buck says: "This is bigger than your dad, Steven."
Buck says: "It's art."
Buck says: "And it's gonna flood the public consciousness."
Steven says: "Let's start handing them out."
Buck says: "Too simple."
Buck says: "We need to get controversial."
Buck says: "We need to create boom—"
Buck says: "a scene."

Sour Cream says: "*picks up and examines the T-shirt* Oh."
Sour Cream says: "This is the coolest thing I've ever been hit in the head with!"
Steven says: "Ronaldo spotted, take aim!"
Buck fires another T-shirt and it knocks Ronaldo's fedora off of his head.
Ronaldo says: "WHOA!"
Ronaldo says: "What the heck?"
Ronaldo says: "Huh?"
Ronaldo says: "*picks up the T-shirt* Whoa, weird!"

Kiki says: "Where'd you get it?"
Jenny says: "I dunno, it just landed in front of me when I was out walking."
Kiki says: "Well, if I were you, I wouldn't wear some random shirt that just fell out of the sky."
Kiki says: "What if there were bugs in it?"
Jenny says: "Re-lax!"
Jenny says: "Who cares where it came from?"
Jenny says: "This shirt is the funniest thing I've seen in my life!"
Buck says: "Looks like our shirt has a really good buzz goin'."
Steven says: "Yeah, but..."
Steven says: "I think they think it's a joke."
Buck says: "Heh."

Buck says: "That's how real art works."
Steven says: "Oh."
Steven says: "Well, I guess you're right."

Pearl says: "!"
Amethyst says: "Whoa, where's the fire?!"
Amethyst says: "!"
Steven says: "It's an emergency!"
Steven says: "You have to help me get rid of all the shirts and stop Buck from making more!"
Pearl says: "Have the shirts come to life and possessed the bodies of their wearers?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Steven says: "No!"
Amethyst says: "Are people catching on fire when they put on the magic shirts?"

Steven says: "What?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "But..."
Steven says: "But I really need your help."
Pearl says: "Steven, this sounds like a very abstract problem."

Amethyst says: "Good point, good point."
Pearl says: "Absolutely."
Steven says: "But..."
Steven says: "!"
Amethyst says: "*starts getting annoyed* Figure something OUT, Steven!"

Garnet says: "Then you can work towards an understanding."
Steven says: "*thinks of an idea and speaks eerily* Oh, I'll make them understand."
Steven says: "*walks out* I'll make them all understand!"
The Gems are mildly surprised.

Mayor Dewey says: "*adjusts his neck tie* Uh..."
Mayor Dewey says: "commemorate this..."
Mayor Dewey says: "uh..."
Mayor Dewey says: "new bench!"
Mayor Dewey says: "But what had happened was I ran out of printer ink in my printer, that I keep at home!"
Steven, wearing sunglasses, appears on the roof of the Funland Arcade. He opens a guitar case and takes out a T-Shirt Cannon. He loads it and takes aim towards Mayor Dewey like a sniper.
Mayor Dewey says: "So, I went to the store and wouldn't you know it?"
Steven says: "*whispering* Bye."
Mayor Dewey says: "-I called up a buddy of mine who owed me a..."
Everything turns into slow motion as Steven fires a T-shirt at Mayor Dewey.
Mayor Dewey Slow motion.
Bodyguard #1 Slow motion.
Mayor Dewey Slow motion.
No!
Bodyguard #2 Slow motion.
Aaaah! *runs away*.
Mayor Dewey gets hit in the chest by the T-shirt and falls backwards onto the bench. Everything returns back to normal speed, as the crowd goes wild and runs in several directions.
Mayor Dewey says: "I've been..."
Mayor Dewey says: "shirt."
Steven fires more T-shirts into the crowd. Buck sees everyone running and picks up a T-shirt, noticing that they all have his "Vote for My Dad" drawing printed on them. Steven then slowly backs away into the shadows, smiling.
Mayor Dewey says: "Buck..."
Mayor Dewey says: "*looking at a T-shirt, feeling touched* Did you make this?"
Buck is speechless. He looks over and sees Sour Cream and Jenny looking at the T-shirts too.
Jenny says: "Ahahaha!"
Jenny says: "This shirt is genius!"
Jenny says: "*laughs with Sour Cream* This is way funnier than "Guitar Dad"!"
Lars says: "Ahahahahahaha, ohoho!"
Mayor Dewey says: "*stops blushing and looks at the T-shirt* This bench is actually pretty comfortable."
Buck sheds a tear under his visor.

Buck says: "You're a cool cat, Steven Universe."
Buck says: "*turns to Greg* Hey, Mr."
Buck says: "U."
Greg says: "You wanna take a picture with me or some junk?"
Buck says: "No way man."
Buck says: "I want a lesson..."
