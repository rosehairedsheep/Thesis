Open Ext. Beach House, Night-time.
Steven and Garnet are star-gazing on the porch, when a shooting star passes by.
Steven says: "Ooh!"
Steven says: "There's one!"
Steven says: "Garnet, you gotta make a wish!"
Garnet says: "All right."
Steven says: "Close your eyes!"
Garnet seemingly closes her eyes under her visor.
Steven says: "All of them."
Garnet says: "Ok, ok."
Steven says: "Now make your wish."
Steven says: "But don't tell me what it is."
Steven says: "*pauses for a bit, and whispers* Garnet, what did you wish for?"
Garnet says: "I wished..."
Garnet says: "for another shooting star so that you could make a wish."
Steven says: "*blushes* Oh my gosh."
Steven gasps as he spots a red shooting star in the sky.
Steven says: "Garnet!"
Steven says: "It worked!"
Distant screaming is then heard as the "star" nears.
Steven says: "Is that star..."
Steven says: "screaming?"
The screaming "star" crashes onto the beach in front of the beach house.
Steven says: "What's that?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven and Garnet quickly run down to the beach, and sees a Ruby lying in a crater.
Steven says: "It's "Navy"!"
Garnet says: "That's..."
Garnet says: "a Ruby."
Steven says: "Don't you remember?"
Steven says: "I gave them all names."
Steven says: "This one's "Navy", 'cause her gem is on her navel."
Garnet says: "Oh."
Garnet says: "I finally get it."
Oh please! Oh please! Don't make me go back to Homeworld! Oh, I wanna stay here with you.
Garnet says: "This..."
Garnet says: "is a surprise."
Steven says: "*pops his bubble* You..."
Steven says: "wanna live on Earth?"
Yeah. All the other Rubies are mean to me. I just want to be somewhere where I can be myself.
Steven says: "You're not mad at us from before?"
What do you mean?
Steven says: "You know, about tricking you into playing baseball?"
That was fun!
Steven says: "Or, when Amethyst pretended to be Jasper?"
I've got to admit, that was pretty clever.
Steven says: "Or when we blasted you all out into space and stole your ship so you'd be stranded forever?"
Well, we were fighting so it's understandable.
Garnet says: "I don't know about this."
Garnet says: "She tried to stab you in space."
Steven says: "That was "Eyeball"."
Steven says: "This is "Navy"."
Steven says: "She..."
Steven says: "always seemed really nice, actually."
Hey thanks!
Steven says: "And you know, a Ruby falling from the sky, discovering this beautiful world."
Steven says: "Sounds a lot like a story you told me once."
Garnet says: "*blushes* Oh stop!"
Steven says: "Let me take it from here!"
Steven says: "I know exactly where she'll fit in."
Garnet says: "All right, Steven Universe."
Garnet says: "Go work your magic."
Trans. Ext. The Barn, Sunrise.
Steven pushes his way through the corn field to find Peridot and Lapis sitting on a tractor.
Peridot says: "Finally!"
Peridot says: "There's a star to wish on."
Steven says: "Peridot!"
Steven says: "Lapis!"
Lapis says: "Steven!"
Peridot says: "Steven!"
Pumpkin runs up to Steven, barking excitedly.
Steven says: "And Pumpkin."
Steven says: "Can't forget you."
Peridot says: "Well well, back again."
Peridot says: "You should just move in with us at this point."
Steven says: "Actually, maybe not me."
Steven says: "But I know someone else who might be interested."
Peridot and Lapis stares at "Navy" in shock and revolt respectively.
Peridot says: "So uhh..."
Peridot says: "when did you show up on Earth?"
Today.
Peridot says: "*excitedly* New barnie!"
Lapis says: "What?!"
Lapis says: "!"
Lapis says: "No!"
Lapis says: "Hold on."
Lapis says: "Can we..."
Lapis says: "talk about this first?"
Peridot says: "Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah."
Peridot says: "Of course."
Peridot says: "I love talking."
Lapis encases "Navy" in a water bubble and floats her away.
Lapis says: "Steven, this makes no sense."
Lapis says: "Why would she wanna live here?"
Lapis says: "We've been awful to her."
Lapis says: "She must hate us."
Steven says: "She doesn't, though."
Steven says: "Give her a chance."
Steven says: "She's on our side now."
Peridot says: "Just like that?"
Peridot says: "Wow."
Lapis says: "There's no way!"
Steven says: "Well, you guys wanted to start a new life here too."
Steven says: "It can totally happen."
Lapis says: "Even if she wants to be here, she doesn't know what she's getting into."
Lapis says: "Life on Earth is really confusing."
Lapis says: "It took me a long time to get used to it."
Lapis says: "I'm still getting used to it."
Steven says: "*thinking* Hmm..."
Peridot says: "But!"
Peridot says: "We can show her the way."
Peridot says: "I mean, we've been through the wringer on all this stuff."
Peridot says: "It'd be cool to share what we've learned."
Peridot says: "And, you know, I think we'll be really good at it."
Lapis says: "Ok..."
Lapis says: "Ok."
Lapis says: "I'll give it a try."
Lapis says: "But we'll have to take it slow."
Peridot says: "Yeah!"
Steven says: "This will be great!"
Steven says: "I just know it!"
Pumpkin barks at "Navy". Lapis snaps her fingers to dispel her water bubble and release "Navy".
Thank you!
Time-Skip; Morning.
Peridot begins lecturing "Navy", and Steven, using the chalkboard.
Peridot says: "So you're an Earthling."
Peridot says: "But what does that mean?"
Peridot says: "Well, the answer is..."
Peridot says: "Who knows?!"
Peridot says: "!"
Peridot says: "*chuckles* And that's the beauty of Earth."
Peridot says: "Nothing here makes sense, but that's why you have us now."
Lapis says: "It might be hard to like Earth at first."
Lapis says: "It is where, a bunch of bad stuff happened."
I love it! It's so... sunny.
Peridot says: "Ah, yes!"
Peridot says: "The sun!"
Peridot says: "Ever burning."
Peridot says: "Until it's not."
Lapis says: "This planet has weather, which can be confusing and alarming."
Lapis says: "It's sunny now, but it can always rain later."
What is... rain?
Lapis says: "It's like- Oh wait!"
Lapis says: "I can just show you."
Lapis controls a giant water bubble over the group and simulates rain with it.
Steven says: "She likes it!"
Steven says: ""Navy" likes it!"
Oh, a planet that's not always sunny. It's almost like, it's always... changing! Oh-ho-ho! It's so beautiful!
Steven says: "Yeah!"
Steven says: "Exactly!"
Peridot says: "Wow!"
Peridot says: "That's like..."
Peridot says: "chapter ninety-seven of Earth stuff!"
Peridot says: "*levitates an umbrella over her and Lapis* Looks like we have an advanced student on our hands."
Lapis says: "*annoyed* Yeah."
Lapis says: "No kidding."
Trans. Int. The Barn.
Peridot and Lapis then show "Navy" in the interior of the barn.
Peridot says: "This is our..."
Peridot says: "Gem Cave."
Peridot says: "Lapis hates it when I call it that."
Peridot says: "So I don't."
Peridot says: "The barn's pretty big so you can have one of the corners."
Peridot says: "*chuckles* Make it your own."
That sounds so nice. Any corner would be lovely.
Steven says: "You should have a look around."
Ooohh. What's this for?
Peridot says: "That's a hammock."
Peridot says: "It's a bed you fall out of."
Lapis says: "It's where I like to sleep."
Lapis says: "I don't have to do it, but I like to do it."
Peridot says: "Snore!"
Peridot says: "Like this!"
Peridot says: "*pretends to sleep and snores loudly, and Lapis blushes* Snore!"
Wow! Sounds groovy! How do I start?
Lapis says: "That one is really hard to explain."
Lapis says: "You lie down somewhere and close your eyes."
Lapis says: "And think about nothing, or everything."
Lapis says: "*annoyed* Looks like you've got it."
Trans. Ext. The Barn.
Peridot and Lapis begin showing "Navy" around the farmland.
Peridot says: "And here is our organic Earth farm."
Peridot says: "The ground around here is teeming with resources which feed the growing crops around us."
Peridot says: "Don't bother talking to the corn."
Peridot says: "It can't hear you."
Lapis says: "Plants may seem strange to you at first."
Lapis says: "But don't worry, you don't have to love everything right away."
I love plants! *throws carrots in the air* Ooohh.
Lapis says: "*slightly irritated* Well, what about Pumpkin?"
Lapis says: "Do you love Pumpkin too?"
Steven says: "Eww!"
Steven says: "Pumpkin kisses."
Lapis says: "*gets annoyed* Well, what about dirt?"
Lapis says: "Do you love the dirt too?"
What's dirt?
Lapis points to the ground.
Ah! I do love the dirt!
Lapis says: "So, what about us?"
Lapis says: "How do you feel about us?"
You guys are the best! Thank you, thank you. Thank you all for taking me in. *hugs Peridot and Steven* Oh, we're gonna be the best of friends.
Lapis says: "But we were just enemies!"
Lapis says: "Don't you remember?"
Lapis says: "*gets flustered* Why don't you get mad?!"
Lapis says: "!"
I think even if I really tried, that's the one thing I can't do.
Lapis says: "..."
Lapis says: "Oh come on!"
Did I do something?
Steven says: "I think it might be more complicated than that."
Steven says: "Why don't you stay here and admire more of the plants?"
Peridot says: "Lapis!"
Steven says: "Lapis!"
Peridot, Pumpkin and Steven run off to look for Lapis, as "Navy" sighs in dismay.
Time-Skip.
Steven, Peridot and Pumpkin try searching for Lapis around the barn.
Peridot says: "Lapis!"
Steven says: "Lapis!"
Steven says: "Where are you?"
Lapis says: "She's just..."
Lapis says: "I-I-It's just like she's fine with us."
Lapis says: "Like, there's no problem."
Steven, Peridot and Pumpkin spots Lapis on the back of the truck sticking out of the barn. Peridot then lifts herself, Pumpkin, and Steven on a trash can lid up to Lapis.
Steven says: "Lapis, are you ok?"
Lapis says: "No."
Lapis says: "Something is seriously wrong with me."
Lapis says: "It took me so long to learn to like this planet."
Peridot says: "Hey, no one said there's a rush."
Lapis says: ""Navy" just loves everyone and everything right away."
Lapis says: "She has no guard, no fear."
Lapis says: "I just don't get it."
Lapis says: "Why it is so easy for her when it was so hard for me?"
Everyone remain in silence as Lapis sulks at herself.
Oh no! I-I didn't to make anyone upset! Oh! Maybe I just should go!
Steven says: "Ah..."
Steven says: ""Navy"!"
Lapis says: "No, no."
Lapis says: "It's my problem."
Lapis says: "I didn't mean to make you feel like you don't belong here."
Peridot says: "Yeah."
Peridot says: "You should stay."
Oh! You guys! I'm so glad! I don't know where I'd go anyway. Can't go anywhere without my ship. That's the only place I ever really belonged anyways. I miss it so much.
Steven says: ""Navy"!"
Steven says: "We have your ship!"
Steven says: "It's right over there!"
You do?
Wow! I didn't even notice it there!
Steven says: "Maybe you could uh..."
Steven says: "show us the ropes?"
Trans. Int. the Roaming Eye.
Steven says: "This is perfect!"
Steven says: "The Crystal Gems finally have a pilot!"
Peridot says: "Things are going ok now, huh?"
Lapis says: "Yeah."
Lapis says: "Yeah they are."
Hey Steven. Hit that button behind you and I'll show you what this baby can really do.
Steven says: "Uh, you mean the one right here?"
Yeah, that's the one!
Steven says: "I'm gonna press it!"
Steven presses the button and the lights in the ship go out. "Navy"'s seat is encased in a light tube and the hatch of the ship open up, causing everybody else fly out and hang onto the edge of the door.
Steven says: ""Navy"!"
Steven says: "Hello!"
Steven says: ""Navy"!"
Steven says: "I think something went wrong with the ship!"
The only thing wrong... is that you're still holding on. *laughs*.
Steven says: "Wait."
Steven says: "This whole time, all you wanted was your ship?"
Steven says: "You could've just stolen it to begin with!"
I could have done that, but then I would've never have gotten to see the look on your face, when you were tricked by your favorite little Ruby! *laughs again*.
Lapis says: "What?!"
Lapis says: "!"
Peridot says: "Hey!"
Peridot says: "I can't hear what's happening!"
Peridot says: "Is "Navy" showing us the ocean?"
Peridot says: "'Cause this is a heck of a way to do it!"
Bye bye!
Steven says: "What!"
Steven says: "Lapis, she's getting away!"
Lapis says: "*suddenly cracks up* I was right!"
Lapis says: "No one could be that well-adjusted."
Lapis keeps laughing hysterically as the Roaming Eye warps away into space. The group then swims their way back to the shore, where they are greeted by Garnet, holding two balloons.
Steven says: "Garnet!"
Garnet pops the balloon reading "Welcome to the Party!" and keeps the one reading "Sorry for your Loss".
Garnet says: "It was still worth a shot."
Everybody looks up at the sky, as the star iris closes over an imaginative face of "Navy" in the sky, laughing aloud as the episode ends.
END.
