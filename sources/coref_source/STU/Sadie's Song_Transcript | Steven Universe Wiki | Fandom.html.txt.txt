Open Beach City Boardwalk.
Another Beach-a-Palooza is being set up on the beach. Steven is seen handing out flyers for the music festival to the citizens of Beach City on the boardwalk. He then makes his way to the Big Donut, when Lars is just leaving the shop.
Steven says: "Here you are, s- my Lars."
Steven says: "Uh, I'll just leave it here for you!"
Int. Big Donut.
Steven enters the donut shop.
Steven says: "Sadie, my lady, I was wondering if I could hang one of these Beach-a-Palooza flyers in..."
Steven says: "*finds that Sadie is not at the counter* Sadie?"
Steven says: "Sadie?"
Steven hears music coming from the break room and peeks in to inspect. He then sees Sadie stacking boxes on shelves, dancing on a stool while singing along to "Haven't You Noticed I'm a Star" on a stereo.
Sadie says: "♫ I can't help it if I make a scene, / Stepping out of my hot pink limousine."
Sadie says: "/ I'm turning heads, and I'm stopping traffic, / When I pose, they scream, and when I joke, they laugh."
Steven is in awe at Sadie's performing capability.
Steven bounces on the spot along to Sadie's singing.
Sadie says: "♫ Everybody needs a friend, / And I've got you and you and you."
Sadie says: "/ So many, I can't even name them, / Can you blame me?"
Steven says: "Yeah, woo-hoo!"
Steven says: "*claps* Yeah, that was amazing!"
Steven says: "Woo-hoo-hoo, awesome!"
Sadie says: "*throws a box away, flustered* No, I- I was just- I wasn't, uh- *turns off the stereo* Ah!"
Steven says: "I didn't know you could sing!"
Sadie says: "Nobody does."
Sadie says: "*sweats anxiously* So, um, do you need something?"
Steven says: "Oh!"
Steven says: "I'm just going around helping Mr."
Steven says: "Smiley hand out flyers for Beach-a-Palooza this year."
Steven says: "*gasps* You should sign up!"
Sadie says: "Uhhh, why?"
Steven says: "Because your voice is beautiful!"
Sadie says: "Aw, anybody can sound fine singing along with that song."
Sadie says: "It's so cheesy, and dumb, and-and catchy, and..."
Sadie says: "I know every single word."
Steven says: "Perfect!"
Steven says: "Now you just need a routine."
Steven says: "I can help you put one together!"
Sadie says: "Uh, really?"
Sadie says: "You think people would want to hear me sing?"
Steven says: "Of course they would, you're great!"
Steven says: "Besides, everyone in town is doing something!"
Sadie says: "Yeah, you know what?"
Sadie says: "Yeah!"
Sadie says: "Who cares, right?"
Sadie says: "What am I afraid of?"
Sadie says: "This could be fun!"
Trans. Int. Sadie's Room.
Sadie leads Steven to the basement of her house.
Steven says: "Your house is so cool."
Sadie says: "Just down here."
Steven says: "Woah!"
Steven says: "You sleep in a basement?"
Sadie says: "I like to think of it like a bunker."
Steven says: "*sees at a huge pile of plush toys and gasps* Are these all yours?"
Sadie says: "Yeah, but, they're not really my thing."
Sadie says: "You can have one if you want."
Steven says: "Err..."
Steven says: "I don't wanna break up a family!"
Sadie says: "So, now I have the CD, I guess I can practice singing."
Steven says: "First we gotta figure out what you're going to wear."
Sadie says: "Does it matter?"
Steven says: "Ever since my act two years ago, there's been a rule that you gotta wear clothes."
Sadie says: "*chuckles* Well, I wasn't planning on going in my underwear."
Steven says: "How about something, flashy, and sparkly, or wait, what do you think that should be your gimmick?"
Sadie says: "Woah, no no no, no gimmicks, the singing's already a stretch."
Sadie says: "Um, maybe this?"
Sadie says: "Or maybe even..."
Steven says: "That one's pretty."
Sadie says: "Uh, I think its a little much, I'll use something comfortable."
A door slam is then heard on the background and Sadie gasps in horror.
Steven says: "What's that?"
Sadie says: "Maybe we'll do this another time!"
Barbara stomps over and barges into Sadie's room.
Barbara says: "Hey Sadie!"
Sadie says: "Hi Mom."
Sadie says: "*tosses the outfits away* You're home early."
Barbara says: "I just had to rush home to show you this!"
Barbara says: "Look at this little guy I got for you."
Barbara says: "*hands her a pink teddy bear* Ain't he the cutest?"
Sadie says: "Oh, thanks Mom."
Barbara says: "Sadie, what are you doing hanging out with Greg's boy?"
Steven says: "Barb!"
Steven says: "I knew you delivered mail but I didn't know you delivered Sadie!"
Sadie says: "Yeah, my mom's the mailman."
Barbara says: "That she is."
Barbara says: "Best dang mailman, woman, or animal on the force."
Barbara says: "*chuckles* At least until they catch me taking from the lost mail bin."
Barbara says: "But that's between us, eh?"
Barbara says: "*playfully slaps Steven in his belly* So Steven, what are your intentions with my daughter?"
Steven says: "We're planning a stage show for-  Beach-a-Palooza."
Barbara's expression becomes stunned as Steven's words repeats dramatically in her head.
Barbara says: "..."
Barbara says: "What was that?"
Sadie says: "*sighs* I'm..."
Sadie says: "going to sing a song at Beach-a-Palooza."
Barbara says: "What!"
Barbara says: "?"
Barbara says: "*grabs Sadie's hands in excitement* Oh-oh-oh-oh, Sadie, you're gonna sing!"
Barbara says: "?"
Sadie says: "Yeah."
Barbara says: "Then c'mon!"
Barbara says: "We have to start planing now!"
Barbara says: "*runs to Sadie's closet* Steven!"
Barbara says: "Help me find an outfit!"
Steven says: "Okay!"
Sadie says: "Ahh, you know I can probably do this by myself."
Barbara says: "It's no trouble."
Barbara says: "We'd love to help you out."
Barbara says: "Right, Steven?"
Steven says: "Right!"
Barbara says: "Oh!"
Barbara says: "Look, its your old ballet outfit!"
Steven says: "You're a ballerina?"
Sadie says: "When I was like, 10."
Barbara says: "*tosses the ballet outfit aside* Oh!"
Barbara says: "It's your swimsuit!"
Barbara says: "She used to be a competitive swimmer."
Sadie says: "*starts blushing* For like a month, when I was 11."
Steven says: "Barb, what's this?"
Barbara says: "Oh!"
Barbara says: "Look!"
Barbara says: "Look!"
Barbara says: "*pulls out a sports attire* Remember when I used to drive you to your softball games?"
Sadie says: "I remember when you punched the umpire."
Barbara says: "That's what he gets for trying to cheat MY daughter out of a double!"
Sadie says: "And then I wasn't really allowed in the league anymore."
Barbara says: "Them's the breaks."
Barbara says: "So what we got planned so far for your show?"
Sadie says: "Nothing, I guess..."
Barbara says: "Well don't you worry, me and Steven will figure out the show for you."
Barbara says: "We'll make sure the world will hear your voice!"
Sadie says: "Well..."
Sadie says: "let's just try to keep it simple?"
Barbara says: "What was that?"
A montage starts to play with "Haven't You Noticed I'm a Star" playing in the background. In the montage, Steven and Barbara assist each other in coming up with Sadie's dance routine, showing Sadie becoming less and less enthused with the process. The pair then also work on Sadie's makeup, and Sadie examines her makeup in a dresser mirror.
Barbara says: "I think we did an excellent job."
Steven says: "We just need to tell Mr."
Steven says: "Smiley to add our name to the flyer."
Sadie says: "Uh, maybe don't put my name on it..."
Sadie says: "?"
Barbara says: "Yeah..."
Barbara says: "what if she was a surprise!"
Barbara says: "?"
Steven says: "That's a great idea!"
Steven says: "She'll be a mystery final act!"
Trans. Ext. Beach-a-Palooza Stage.
Mr. Smiley is emceeing the festival on the stage as the crowd cheers.
Mr. Smiley says: "Thank you, Beach-a-Palooza!"
Mr. Smiley says: "You get this next act from their day job, delivering pizza!"
Mr. Smiley says: "But tonight, they're delivering jokes!"
Mr. Smiley says: "..."
Mr. Smiley says: "That was a joke!"
Mr. Smiley says: "Let me hear a big round of applause for Kiki and her ventriloquist dummy!"
Mr. Smiley reveals Kiki on stage, withNanefua sitting on her lap, pretending to be a ventriloquist puppet.
Nanefua says: "Kiki, that rude Mr."
Nanefua says: "Smiley just called me a dummy!"
Kiki says: "That's just our act, Gunga."
Kiki says: "Why don't you show them your jokes?"
Nanefua says: "How does a pizza tie its shoes?"
Kiki says: "How?"
Nanefua says: "With a garlic knot!"
A rimshot is played, while the crowd starts laughing. Kiki and Nanefua then walks off the stage, while Ronaldo stands near the stage waiting with his chalkboard.
Mr. Smiley says: "Haha, alright!"
Mr. Smiley says: "Well, we're gettin' closer to our mystery guest!"
Mr. Smiley says: "Even I don't know who it is, and I'm the host!"
Mr. Smiley says: "But first, Ronaldo Fryman with, "A Lecture on Rock People: Identification and Defense"!"
Ronaldo goes onstage with his chalkboard, while Steven and Barbara continue to prep with Sadie backstage.
Steven says: "I can't believe it, the flyers really worked!"
Steven says: "The whole town is here, plus some!"
Barbara says: "Oh, my Sadie, such a big star!"
Barbara says: "Never even went to the prom, and look at you now!"
Sadie says: "..."
Sadie says: "Am I on yet?"
Mr. Smiley says: "Sadie Miller!"
Mr. Smiley says: "?"
Mr. Smiley says: "You're the mystery guest!"
Mr. Smiley says: "?"
Mr. Smiley says: "I never even would've recognized ya!"
Sadie says: "Oh, uh, hi Mr."
Sadie says: "Smiley."
Sadie says: "Uh, um, mm, how uh, how are you?"
Mr. Smiley says: "..."
Mr. Smiley says: "I'm fine."
Mr. Smiley says: "But it looks like someone here has a case of..."
Mr. Smiley says: "the "showbiz shakes"."
Mr. Smiley says: "You know what a friend of mine told me once?"
Mr. Smiley says: "A little smile never hurt anybody."
Steven and Barbara lean in, also smiling. Sadie cracks a nervous smile.
Mr. Smiley says: "Aww..."
Mr. Smiley says: "lookin' good!"
Steven says: "Thank you!"
Barbara says: "Thank you!"
Sadie stops smiling and sighs heavily. She then becomes agitated as Barbara starts showering her with glitter.
Steven says: "More sparkles!"
Barbara says: "Yes, sir!"
Mr. Smiley says: "Next up, ladies and gentlemen, your mailman and mime, *chuckles* Jamie!"
Jamie goes up on stage and starts encapsulating himself in an invisible box, while old-timey piano music starts playing.
Jenny says: "Oh, it's a box, he's..."
Jenny says: "he's, he's doing a box."
Barbara says: "*gasps* Uh-oh, no more glitter."
Barbara says: "I'll have to run and get the emergency supply from the car."
Barbara says: "Guard m'girl, Steven."
Steven nods, only to find Sadie walking off to look at the crowd.
Steven says: "*gasps* Sadie, come back here!"
Sadie peers at the crowd and spots Lars hanging out with the cool kids.
Jenny says: "I can't wait for this mystery act!"
Jenny says: "You think it's a juggler?"
Jenny says: "Maybe they'll juggle something sharp."
Jenny says: "*hands a flyer to Lars* I'm gonna have my phone ready in case someone gets hurt."
Sadie gasps and hides backstage.
Steven says: "Sadie!"
Sadie says: "Ugh, I - I can't breathe!"
Sadie runs and gets a drink of water from the water tank, gasping heavily.
Steven says: "Okay, okay, if you're not gonna come back and let me work on you, then let's work on the routine!"
Sadie says: "Okay..."
Steven says: "Oh, no!"
Steven says: "You ruined my lipstick!"
Steven says: "Never fear, Steven's here."
Steven draws a crude smile over Sadie's frown. Sadie starts screaming, knocks the lid off of the water tank, and dunks her face into the water.
Steven says: "Sadie..."
Steven says: "?"
Steven says: "Why did you do that?"
Sadie says: "*pulls herself out of the tank* AGH!"
Sadie says: "Because, you're just as bad as my mom!"
Sadie quickly covers her mouth, as Barbara appears with a bucket of glitter, which she drops after hearing Sadie's remark.
Barbara says: "What!"
Barbara says: "?"
Sadie says: "*gets defensively* Please, Mom."
Sadie says: "Don't make me do this!"
Barbara says: "Make you!"
Barbara says: "?"
Barbara says: "You said you wanted to sing!"
Sadie says: "Yeah, I did!"
Sadie says: "I did!"
Sadie says: "I did, I did!"
Sadie says: "Just like I say lots of things!"
Sadie says: "Like, "Hey Mom, swimming looks fun," then bam, suddenly I'm anchoring a 400-meter relay for the Beach City Seals!"
Sadie says: ""Hey Mom, I thought signing up for softball would be nice!"
Sadie says: "" Six birthdays later, I'm still getting nothing but knee pads and batting helmets!"
Sadie says: ""Hey Mom, I want to sing in this year's Beach-a-Palooza," and what do I get!"
Sadie says: "?"
Sadie says: "THIS!"
Sadie says: "I just thought, for once, I'd get to do things my way, but you came in and took over everything like you always do!"
Barbara says: "I just wanted everyone to know how talented my daughter is!"
Sadie says: "This is not your daughter!"
Barbara says: "..."
Mr. Smiley says: "Next up, the one you've all been waiting for, the one, the only, mystery guest!"
Sadie says: "Aggh!"
Sadie says: "How did I let this happen!"
Sadie says: "?"
Sadie says: "I don't wanna do this!"
Steven says: "You never did."
Steven says: "I-It was always me."
Mr. Smiley says: "Give it up for..."
Steven runs onstage wearing Sadie's outfit and make-up.
Kiki says: "Looks like you called it, Gunga."
Nanefua says: "That mystery guest bit had Steven written all over it."
Steven starts singing the song and the crowd cheers him on, with the exception of Lars, who is on his phone. At the end of his act, Steven tosses the glitter in the bucket into the air. The scene then transitions into the Big Donut's break room, as some times passes, Sadie sings the last verse of the song while Steven plays his ukulele. The star iris then closes on Sadie's face, ending the episode.
END.
