Open Ext. It's a Wash.
Steven is sitting on a chair outside of the car wash, reading his own texts while texting on his phone.
Steven says: ""Hey, Connie."
Steven says: "How are you today?"
Steven says: "" "Hope everything's going okay."
Steven says: "" "It'd be cool if you told me it was..."
Steven says: "" "I guess I miss you."
Steven says: "" "I know yesterday I said, "I guess" but I mean," "I do miss you..."
Steven says: "" "Hope you didn't get your phone mixed up with a tennis ball."
Steven says: "Ha ha."
Steven says: "" A tennis ball?"
Steven says: "Really, Universe?!"
Steven says: "!"
Greg says: "Help!"
Greg says: "Ah!"
Greg says: "Yah!"
Greg says: "Back!"
Greg is then seen struggling to remove a water hose that is tangled around himself.
Greg says: "Ugh!"
Greg says: "Hey, uh, Steve-aroni, ughh, want to help your old Pa over here?"
Steven says: "Uh, yeah, Dad, one sec."
Steven reluctantly sends a final text to Connie, reading "Please talk to me.".
Steven says: "Sorry."
Steven says: "Sorry."
Steven says: "I'm on it."
Steven runs up to Greg and bites off a piece of the hose, freeing Greg.
Steven says: "*grunts* Are you good?"
Steven says: "Are you safe?"
Steven says: "Do you still love me?"
Greg says: "Yeah, of- of course, buddy."
Greg says: "It's just some hoses."
Greg says: "I can buy new ones."
Greg says: "I still have like..."
Greg says: "9 million dollars left, and what better way to spend that than on some hoses, right, kiddo?"
Steven says: "Yeah, Dad."
Steven's cellphone vibrates and gasps in shock. He holds out his phone and reluctantly checks it, only to see a text from Ronaldo.
Ronaldo Voiceover.
Steven sighs in dismay.
Greg says: "Hey, is..."
Greg says: "everything okay?"
Greg says: "You're looking a little glum."
Steven says: "I am a little glum."
Greg says: "Do you want to talk about it?"
Steven says: "Umm..."
Steven says: "It's just..."
Steven says: "space lag..."
Steven says: "from when I went to space."
Greg says: "Hmm..."
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Back home, Steven is absentmindedly wiping a plate with a soap bottle, still sighing in disappointment, when his cellphone starts vibrating again.
Steven says: "Ah!"
Steven says: "*throws the plate and soap bottle away in surprise* Waahh!"
Steven reaches for his phone but then pauses himself.
Steven says: "Wait."
Steven says: "No."
Steven says: "I need to play it cool."
Steven casually flips over his phone and eagerly checks his phone screen.
Ronaldo Voiceover.
Disappointed, Steven puts down his phone, when he hears Greg's voice from outside.
Greg says: "Steven, you want to help us with these..."
Greg says: "groceries?"
Steven says: "Coming."
Greg and the Crystal Gems walk in,each carrying some groceries.
Greg says: "Eh?"
Greg says: "Eh?"
Amethyst says: "*muffled( Check this out, Steven."
Amethyst says: "*spits out an egg, with normal voice again* It's farm fresh."
Steven says: "Uhh..."
Steven says: "Thanks guys, but the fridge is full."
Greg says: "Not the fridge at our vacation house!"
Greg pulls a confetti popper as the Gems clap and cheer.
The Gems says: "Whoo!"
The Gems says: "Vacation!"
Greg says: "I thought, "Why spend money on hoses when I can spend it on houses?"
Greg says: "" So I found a place we could rent for the weekend by searching online."
Greg holds up his phone, displaying an image of their vacation house with a four star rating.
Greg says: "Back in the old days, we just went door-to-door hoping one was unlocked."
Greg says: "But, this is the new days!"
Steven says: "Okay."
Steven says: "Well, have fun."
Greg says: "Uh, Steven, you're going on vacation, too."
Pearl says: "Oh, yes."
Pearl says: "This is the perfect time for a vacation- I mean, how often are we on the same planet together?"
Amethyst says: "Yeah."
Amethyst says: "And you'll be with your favorite Gems, and your favorite dad."
Garnet says: "Agree with Amethyst."
Garnet says: "Turn to Steven."
Garnet says: "Steven, you should go."
Garnet says: "No, with more enthusiasm."
Garnet says: "Steven, it's a vacation!"
Steven says: "I mean, I would, but I'm really tied up with something important."
Steven checks his phone again, as more texts keep appearing from Ronaldo.

Steven says: "I'll go."
Garnet says: "Aced it!"
Trans. Ext. Cool Ranch.
Greg drives Steven and the Gems in his van up to the front of their vacation house, while Steven's eyes is fixated onto his phone.
Greg says: "Here it is, temporary home sweet temporary home."
Everyone gets out and begins unloading the van; Steven observes Garnet and Amethyst carrying a mattress in the house.
Steven says: "Is that my bed?"
Greg says: "Yeah."
Greg says: "I want you to be as comfortable as possible, finally have some family time."
Greg says: "I feel..."
Greg says: "like you haven't had that in a while."
Steven says: "*looking down at his phone* Yeah, maybe."
Greg says: "This place is great!"
Greg says: "They have one of those refrigerators that dispense water, not to mention four windows, and an analog clock!"
Pearl says: "*reading off a piece of memo* Hmm, says here we can't use the water dispenser or the clock."
Pearl says: "Windows must be kept closed at all times, and remove all shoes before entering."
Pearl says: "Hmm."
Pearl notices a pair of shoes outside the house. She picks them up and throws them away, before walking inside the house. Amethyst then peeks out through the doorway.
Amethyst says: "Hey, Greg, did you invite anyone else?"
Amethyst says: "Party guy, about three feet long, hissing, reptilian?"
Greg says: "No..."
Greg says: "?"
Amethyst says: "Well..."
Amethyst says: "You might want to factor in a plus-one."
Pearl says: "Oh!"
Pearl says: "Party guy!"
Pearl says: "No!"
Hissing and clashing noises are heard from within the house.
Greg says: "I promise."
Greg says: "It's gonna be a really good time."
Steven says: "*keeps looking down at his phone* It's a great place, Dad."
Time-Skip; Dusk.
Steven, Greg, and the Gems are gathered outside, lounging and barbecuing.
Amethyst says: "It only bit Pearl once, but, like, we're Gems."
Amethyst says: "She'll be okay."
Pearl says: "*groans* It isn't the pain."
Pearl says: "It's the surprise."
Greg and Amethyst glance over to Steven, who is still engrossed on his phone.
Greg says: "Hey, Amethyst, do you think you could..."
Amethyst says: "Yeah!"
Amethyst says: "*walks over and sits down beside Steven* Hey, Steven."
Steven says: "Hi, Amethyst."
Amethyst says: "Man, you can see the stars so clearly out here."
Amethyst says: "It's pretty, huh?"
Steven says: "Huh?"
Steven says: "Uh, I don't know."
Steven says: "*shrugs* It's..."
Steven says: "okay."
Amethyst says: "Hey, hey."
Amethyst says: "It's okay, if it isn't okay."
Steven says: "The sky?"
Amethyst says: "Yeah."
Steven says: "What?"
Amethyst says: "*shrugs* I don't know."
Amethyst says: "So, uh, you really into phones now?"
Steven says: "No."
Steven nervously puts his phone away. Amethyst looks at Greg and shrugs.
Time-Skip; Night-time.
Still staring at his phone, Steven bumps into the door inside the house, and opens it to walk outside, when Greg and Garnet, sitting in a hot tub, greet him.
Greg says: "Hey, Schtu-ball!"
Greg says: "Won't you take my place?"
Greg says: "I've been in here way too long."
Greg says: "I'm gonna become a raisin."
Greg winks at Garnet before climbing out and walking away.
Garnet says: "Steven, you should join me."
Garnet says: "Become a raisin."
Steven says: "Okay, but one sec."
Steven walks away and returns with his phone in a ziplock bag, and climbs into the tub with his clothes still on.
Garnet says: "Steven, I know what's troubling you."
Steven says: "You do?"
Steven says: "*smiles in a sense of relief* Gosh."
Steven says: "I really messed up, didn't I?"
Garnet says: "You didn't do anything wrong."
Garnet says: "Pink Diamond was a villain."
Steven's relief quickly fades, as Garnet attempts to weave another epic tale, cuing a flashback of the Crystal Gems facing off a massive Gem, presumably Pink Diamond.
Garnet says: "It was 5,750 years ago."
Steven says: "Yeah, I know."
The flashback abruptly ends.
Garnet says: "Oh."
Steven says: "Pink Diamond was bad."
Steven says: "Everything bad had to happen so good things could kind of happen."
Garnet says: "Uh, good."
Garnet says: "You understand."
Time-Skip; The Next Day.
Steven is rocking back and forth on a chair outside the house, still fixated on his phone.
Steven says: "Buzz."
Steven says: "Buzz."
Steven says: "At least wiggle a little."
Greg says: "Come on."
Greg says: "Can't you give it another shot?"
Overhearing the others inside the house, Steven approaches the door and peeks inside.
Amethyst says: "What are we supposed to do?"
Amethyst says: "He just doesn't want to talk about it."
Greg says: "But..."
Greg says: "I know it's not space lag."
Greg says: "This is some Gem thing he knows I won't understand."
Greg says: "I don't know anything about Homeworld."
Greg says: "I don't know anything about your society."
Greg says: "Whatever horrible things he saw out there, you guys have to put it into context."
Garnet says: "If Steven won't talk to us, then the help we can give him is limited."
Garnet says: "We've all tried to coax it out of him, except for..."
Pearl says: "Me?"
Pearl says: "But I have no idea what Homeworld is like now."
Greg says: "Pearl, please."
Amethyst says: "He knows you know about space stuff."
Garnet says: "It can't hurt to try."
Pearl walks toward the door, prompting Steven to quickly move away.
Steven says: "Mmm!"
Steven sits down on the porch, pretending to stare at his phone, as Pearl steps outside.
Pearl says: "Heh, it sure is quiet out here, huh?"
Steven says: "Yeah."
Pearl says: "So..."
Pearl says: "Homeworld..."
Pearl says: "I always hoped you'd see it some day, but I thought I'd be there with you."
Pearl says: "Being taken there..."
Pearl says: "as a prisoner, I suppose it was something of a..."
Pearl says: "traumatic experience..."
Pearl says: "?"
Pearl glances down at Steven, still on his phone.
Pearl says: "It's just..."
Pearl says: "*sits down*next to Steven* Steven, I'm sure you have a lot of questions you'd like answers to, like about the Diamonds, for instance?"
Pearl says: "There are things that are..."
Pearl says: "impossible for me to explain."
Pearl says: "But I want to."
Pearl almost instantly, seemingly involuntarily, covers her mouth before she can speak, as Steven grows increasingly distressed. Pearl tries to pull her hand off her hands with her other hand.
Steven says: "Connie hates me!"
Pearl says: "..."
Pearl says: "Wha?"
Greg, Garnet, and Amethyst suddenly burst through the door.
Greg says: "We weren't listening."
Garnet says: "Also continue, Steven."
Steven says: "I'm not upset about what happened on Homeworld although, yeah, a lot of that was really messed up."
Steven says: "But my relationship with Connie is even more messed up."
Steven says: "I left her behind to go to Homeworld after promising we'd face everything together."
Steven says: "I'm sure I really hurt her."
Steven says: "I've been calling and texting her for a week, but she hasn't responded once."
Steven says: "*tears up* Connie might never talk to me again."
Steven runs away crying.
Garnet says: "Steven!"
Greg says: "I'll go get him."
Greg says: "I don't know anything about Homeworld, but I know about this."
Greg begins searching for Steven, who is seen cowering behind a pair of  barrels.
Greg says: "Steven?"
Greg says: "Steven?"
Steven says: "Steven's not here."
Greg says: "Oh, that's too bad."
Greg says: "So, I guess I'll just talk to this Steven-shaped barrel instead."
Steven says: "If you must."
Greg says: "Schtu-ball, if this was about Connie, why didn't you say anything sooner?"
Steven says: "I was..."
Steven says: "embarra..."
Greg says: "You were..."
Greg says: "embroidered?"
Greg says: "Embroiled?"
Greg says: "Emboldened to talk to your old man about your problems?"
Steven says: "I was embarrassed, okay!"
Steven says: "?"
Steven says: "You and the Gems all like Connie, and I was worried that if you heard what happened then..."
Steven says: "You'd be mad at me too."
Greg says: "Oh, Steven, of course we're not mad."
Greg says: "And I'm sure Connie's not mad, either."
Greg says: "Well, at least I'm sure she doesn't hate you."
Greg says: "That whole handing-yourself-over-to-Homeworld thing was definitely a high-stress situation."
Greg says: "It really scared all of us."
Greg says: "I'm not exactly over it either, but I guess carting you off to the middle of nowhere to spend time with you is my way of dealing with it."
Greg says: "Maybe having some distance from you is Connie's way."
Steven says: "But the last thing I did was send her a bunch of dumb texts."
Greg says: "Tennis?"
Steven says: "*hands Greg his phone* See?"
Steven says: "No wonder she hasn't responded."
Greg says: "Uhh, Steven?"
Greg says: "You don't get any service out here."
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "What are you even telling me?"
Steven says: "Maybe she's been trying to get in touch with me this whole time, and I haven't seen it!"
Steven says: "What if she thinks I'm ignoring her?"
Steven says: "Dad!"
Steven says: "We have to find cell service."
Greg says: "Right!"
Time-Skip; Dusk.
Steven gets into Greg's van and signals the Gems to get in.
Steven says: "Go, go, go!"
Pearl says: "Okay."
Steven buckles his seat belt and holds out his phone.
Steven says: "Floor it!"
Greg steps on the accelerator panel and begins driving away from Cool Ranch.
Greg says: "How we doing?"
Steven says: "*observing the signal bars on his phone* Take a right!"
Greg turns the van right, driving it off-road.
Steven says: "Nah, back up."
Steven says: "No, wait!"
Steven says: "Keep going!"
The signal begins to improve.
Greg says: "We're heading for a cliff, buddy."
Steven says: "Just a little further."
Greg says: "Gonna have to stop soon."
Steven says: "Almost got it!"
Greg says: "Ahh!"
Greg stops the van just before the edge of the cliff. He sighs in  relief as Steven climbs onto the roof of the van.
Steven says: "Come on."
Steven says: "Come on."
Steven says: "Come on."
Steven says: "Yes!"
Steven says: "We've got service!"
A new message pops up on Steven's phone and Steven gasps in surprise. He opens it only to find...
Ronaldo Voiceover.
Greg says: "*peeks up at the roof of the van* Well?"
Steven says: "*disappointed*..."
Steven says: "No."
Steven says: "No messages from Connie."
Greg climbs up onto the roof and sits down beside Steven, who quickly falls over onto Greg's lap in remorse.
Greg says: "Aww."
Greg says: "You'll get through this, buddy."
Greg says: "I know it hurts now, but..."
Greg says: "give it time."
Steven says: "I know."
Steven says: "I need to let it go."
The Gems then peeks up at the roof too.
Pearl says: "Got room for three more?"
Steven says: "Always."
The Gems climb atop and join Steven and Greg on the roof.
Amethyst says: "Nice night, isn't it?"
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "Yeah."
END.
