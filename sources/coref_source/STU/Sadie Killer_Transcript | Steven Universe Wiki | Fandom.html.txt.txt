Open Int. The Big Donut; Daytime.
Steven enters the Big Donut, where a tired Sadie is seen greeting farewell to some customers.
Sadie says: "Thanks for coming."
Sadie, almost unconsciously, begins to mop the floor.
Steven says: "Hey, Sadie!"
Sadie says: "Hey, Steven."
Sadie says: "What'll it be?"
Steven says: "Sorry to be a pain, but I got kind of a long order."
Steven says: "I hope it's not too much trouble."
Sadie says: "What trouble?"
Sadie says: "*chuckles* I'm a professional donut girl."
Steven says: "Okay..."
Steven says: "I'll have one jelly donut with powdered sugar on the side, three chocolate frosted, one frosted chocolate, two chocolate-frosted chocolate, one dog-nut; medium well, one coffee with milk and sugar, hold the coffee."
Steven says: "I also have several methods of payment I'd like you to split this order across evenly."
Sadie says: "Uh, what's all this for?"
Steven says: "Band practice!"
Sadie says: "You're in a band?!"
Sadie says: "!"
Steven says: "Kinda."
Steven says: "I started jamming with Jenny, Buck, and Sour Cream!"
Sadie says: "Whoa!"
Sadie says: "That's so cool!"
Sadie says: "Aww man!"
Sadie says: "I bet you guys sound amazing!"
Steven says: "We're still trying to figure out our sound, but it's been fun just playing music with other people."
Steven says: "It's also nice to have an outlet that doesn't involve space and Gem stuff and everything else going on."
Steven says: "Um..."
Steven says: "You doing okay?"
Sadie says: "Well, I worry about Lars being in space, and I hope he's safe and all, but..."
Sadie says: "Ughh..."
Sadie says: "Working all these shifts by myself has been a huge drag."
Sadie says: "I'm totally used to doing his work, but I'm used to at least having him here to talk to."
Sadie says: "Now, I gotta do that myself, too."
Sadie says: ""Oh, come on, Sadie, you missed a spot!"
Sadie says: "" Oh, no, sorry."
Steven says: "Well, we'll all be practicing at Sour Cream's place tonight."
Steven says: "Feel free to stop by if you have time."
Sadie says: "I'll try!"
Sadie says: "Hopefully, I can finish restocking napkins early."
Sadie says: "We're always running out for some reason."
Steven says: "*takes a whole stack of napkins* Hmm, weird."
Steven says: "Well, see ya, Sadie!"
Sadie says: "Bye, Steven."
Trans. Ext. Sour Cream's House.
Steven, Jenny and Sour Cream are seen hanging outside of the garage, while Sour Cream is experimenting with his Launchpad.
Steven says: "What do ya call that style?"
Sour Cream says: "Beachcore."
Buck arrives, running in with a guitar case on his back.
Buck says: "Hey."
Jenny says: "What's up, Buck?"
Buck says: "Guess who's got a gig at Delmarva's number-two music and seafood festival this weekend?!"
Buck says: "!"
Jenny says: "Chugi and the Woo Woos?"
Sour Cream says: "Jack and the Frosted Tips?"
Steven says: "7-Force?"
Buck says: "..."
Buck says: "No, us!"
Steven says: "What?!"
Buck says: "What?!"
Jenny says: "What?!"
Steven says: "!"
Buck says: "!"
Jenny says: "!"
Steven says: "We don't even have a name yet!"
Jenny says: "Or a set list!"
Sour Cream says: "Or even one single song to put on a set list!"
Jenny says: "*sighs* Guess we got a lot of work to do."
Time-Skip; Night-time.
The group continues to brainstorm ideas for their band.
Sour Cream says: "What if we went for a more of a rap-a-billy style?"
Jenny says: "No, thanks."
Steven says: "How about something like..."
Steven says: "*begins playing his electric guitar* ♪ Here we are, our hearts combining."
Steven says: "Music and friends, our souls aligning."
Buck says: "Hold on, Steven."
Buck says: "You got a really cool sentiment going on that can resonate with a wide audience."
Buck says: "I just feel like this seafood festival needs to hear something challenging and provocative."
Buck says: "Check this out."
Buck says: "*strums his guitar* ♪ Doo-doo."
Buck says: "*strumming* ♪ Butt."
Buck says: "*strumming* ♪ The government."
Buck says: "*strumming* ♪ Corrupts."
Jenny says: "Hold on there, Bucky D."
Jenny says: "I'm all for being socially conscious and waking people up inside, but people are gonna be at this seafood fest to have fun!"
Jenny says: "Let's give them something they can dance to!"
Jenny says: "Sour Cream, give me a beat!"
Sour Cream says: "A what?"
Jenny says: "A beat!"
With her voice captured, Sour Cream uses the Launchpad to create a beat with Jenny's voice.
Jenny says: "Oh, yeah!"
Jenny says: "Let's spice it up!"
Jenny begins playing a funky riff on her bass.
Steven says: "Cool."
Sour Cream says: "Yeah!"
Sour Cream says: "And then how about some..."
Sour Cream makes some screeching tones on the Launchpad, startling Jenny.
Jenny says: "WHAT THE HECK, SOUR CREAM!"
Jenny says: "?"
Sour Cream says: "What?"
Sour Cream says: "Can't let your audience get too comfortable."
Steven says: "Maybe we should just call it a night, and try again tomorrow."
Jenny says: "Agreed."
Just then, Sadie arrives.
Sadie says: "Oh, hey, guys!"
Sadie says: "Sorry, I'm so late."
Sadie says: "Took longer to close up than I thought it would."
Sadie says: "Ya'll still practicing?"
Jenny says: "Oh sorry, Sadie, we just wrapped up."
Jenny says: "We were getting nowhere."
Sadie says: "Aww shoot!"
Sadie says: "I really wanted to hear you guys."
Sadie says: "Well, let me know if you have another band practice when I'm not working."
Sadie says: "See ya, guys."
Jenny says: "Bye, Sadie!"
Buck says: "Bye, Sadie!"
Sour Cream says: "Later."
Jenny says: "See ya, girl."
Steven looks on with pity as Sadie leaves.
Trans. Ext. Miller Residence, The Next Afternoon.
Sadie returns home one afternoon, holding a bag of donuts, and is about to enter her house, when...
Steven says: "Hi, Sadie!"
Sour Cream says: "Hey, how's it goin'?"
Buck says: "S'up?"
Jenny says: "Hey, girl."
Sadie says: "*startled* Whoa!"
Sadie says: "Hey, guys!"
Sadie says: "I just got home from work."
Steven says: "We know."
Steven says: "We followed you."
Steven says: "Sorry if that's weird."
Buck says: "We know how busy your schedule is, so, we decided to bring the jam to you."
Sadie says: "Aw, shucks, guys!"
Sadie says: "But..."
Sadie says: "*groans nervously* My room is such a mess right now."
Sadie says: "Okay, ah- okay, just give me a moment to tidy up!"
Trans. Int. Sadie's Room.
Sadie puts away a pile of clothes, as the group enters her room.
Jenny says: "Dang, Sadie!"
Jenny says: "You've got so much space in here!"
Sour Cream says: "Yo, Sadie, do you have any free outlets to plug into?"
Sadie says: "*hides her movies under her blanket* Oh, yeah, check over by the TV."
The group begins setting up their music instruments.
Jenny says: "Let's get serious now."
Jenny says: "The show is this weekend!"
Buck says: "Wait..."
Buck says: "I can't really..."
Buck says: "feel the music in this..."
Buck says: "cramped spot."
Buck says: "*walks over to Sadie's bed* This looks comfy."
Sadie says: "No, wait!"
Buck sits on Sadie's bed, and crunching noise are heard underneath the blanket.
Buck says: "Aw, doo-doo."
Buck says: "I think I broke your bed."
Sadie says: "Gah!"
Sadie shoves Buck off her bed and lifts the blanket to see if her video cassettes are okay.
Sour Cream says: "Whoa!"
Sour Cream says: "Scary movies!"
Sour Cream says: "Hey, Sadie, you've got a dark side."
Sadie says: "It's more of a..."
Sadie says: "dork side."
Jenny says: "Hey, is that "The Lurch"?"
Sadie says: "You know this one?"
Jenny says: "Yeah!"
Jenny says: "It's a classic!"
Jenny says: "I can't believe you have a copy!"
Jenny says: "Guys, we have to watch this."
Time-Skip.
The group watches the movie on Sadie's TV with the lights off. On-screen, groaning gray zombies approach a man and woman huddled in fear.
Zombie TV.
Brains... *groans*.
The woman in the movie then screams in fear.
Sadie says: "I can't believe you like this one."
Sadie says: "Not everyone appreciates Bulgarian horror."
Steven says: "*covers his eyes in fear* Uh, guys, don't we need to find our sound?"
Sour Cream says: "I kinda like this sound."
Sour Cream walks over to his laptop and adds a dark electronic beat over the eerie music from the movie.
Jenny says: "Ooh."
Jenny says: "I like that."
Jenny picks up her bass and adds a rhythmic tune to the music.
Steven says: "And then, we can do this."
Steven begins strumming his electric guitar in short rhythms.
Buck says: "Now, we just need some provocative lyrics."
Sadie says: "..."
Sadie says: "♪ Tired..."
Sadie says: "from work."
Buck says: "Nice."
Sadie says: "*chuckles* ♪ Hate..."
Sadie says: "my job."
Buck adds an acoustic solo to the music, and Sadie begins to sing.
Sadie says: "♪ I really oughta be in mourning, / But I've got another shift this morning."
Sadie says: "/ Every day feels like it's never-ending."
Sadie says: "/ What's the point of all this time I'm spending, / Here..."
Sadie says: "/ At this, / Dead-end job!"
Sadie says: "/ Ooh!"
Sadie says: "/ We are the Working Dead."
Sadie says: "/ And we lurch for minimum wage."
Sadie says: "/ But I'd really rather be..."
Sadie says: "/ Eating your brain!"
Sadie starts to roam the room more intensely, intimidatingly taunting each of the band members with her song lyrics.
Sadie says: "♪ Look at you - You seem so bright and healthy."
Sadie says: "/ ♪ And your minds are full of joy and wonder."
Sadie says: "/ Stay a thousand miles from the condition, / That I've got from all the stress I'm under."
Sadie says: "/ Don't come near me or you might encourage, / All these terrifying sudden urges."
Sadie begins rummaging through her closet while the others look on anxiously. She then puts a jacket and smudges a red lipstick over her eyes, creating a gothic appearance.
Sadie says: "♪ Seeing you makes skipping work so tempting."
Sadie says: "/ Don't you know that in the night, I'm temping, / Here..."
Sadie says: "/ At this, / Dead-end job!"
Sadie says: "/ Ooh!"
Sadie says: "/ We are the Working Dead."
Sadie says: "/ And we lurch for minimum wage."
Sadie says: "/ But I'd really rather be..."
Sadie says: "/ Eating your brain!"
Sadie chomps into a jelly-filled donut, squirting the red jelly out like blood, as the woman from the movie screams in terror.
Steven says: "Whoa!"
Buck says: "Whoa!"
Jenny says: "Whoa!"
Sour Cream says: "Whoa!"
Steven says: "Sadie, that was awesome!"
Jenny says: "Yeah, girl, yeah!"
Sour Cream says: "That was so rad!"
Buck says: "You're not Sadie Miller."
Buck says: "You're Sadie Killer."
Jenny says: "This is it!"
Jenny says: "This is our sound!"
Jenny says: "Sadie, you should be our frontman!"
Sadie says: "Really?!"
Sadie says: "!"
Sadie says: "*chuckles* Wow, I..."
Sadie says: "Uhh, wait, no, I can't."
Sadie says: "Ugh, I've got to work tomorrow."
Sadie says: "Actually, you guys should probably pack up."
Sadie says: "I got to get some rest before my shift."
The groups stare at Sadie in somber.
Buck says: "Aww, doo-doo."
Trans. Int. the Big Donut, The Next Day.
Sadie is wiping the glass donut cabinet, when Steven enters and idles excitedly.
Sadie says: "Hey."
Sadie says: "What're you doing here?"
Steven says: "I was just wondering if I could get some advice."
Steven says: "We've been trying to write some more spooky songs without you, but..."
Steven says: "They sound so phony coming from me."
Steven says: ""Rawr, I'm a bad, bad boy!"
Steven says: "" Yeesh..."
Steven says: "I don't know."
Steven says: "I can't do it like you."
Steven says: "You got any tips?"
Sadie says: "Let's see."
Sadie says: "First, lose your youth to your boring job."
Sadie says: "Then, lose the only person you've ever felt truly close to."
Sadie says: "And then, lose your mind working all his shifts."
Steven says: "I don't think I can do all that before the show tomorrow."
Steven says: "*chuckles nervously* Are you sure you can't come?"
Sadie says: "I'm the only employee at the shop."
Sadie says: "I can't just leave."
Sadie says: "Singing is fun, and-and being in the band would be really fun, like the most fun ever."
Sadie says: "Bu-But a lot of things could be a lot of things."
Sadie says: "This job is a drag, but at least I know it's a drag."
Sadie says: "It's normal."
Sadie says: "There's something nice about that, you know?"
Sadie says: "Hanging out, singing and stuff, it feels so not normal."
Sadie says: "It's like- You ever feel so bad that you feel good?"
Sadie says: "Like, when you get so cold that it burns."
Sadie says: "Sometimes, I just want to scream my guts out."
Sadie says: "Well, no, not my guts, but whatever thing is squirming in my guts."
Steven says: "*scribbling notes* Wow!"
Steven says: "Tha-that's poetry!"
Steven says: "You're such a natural at this!"
Steven says: "All right, I'll try my best."
Steven says: "How's this?"
Steven says: "♪ Hate my job!"
Steven says: "Hate my job!"
Steven says: "Obligations!"
Steven says: "No vacations!"
Steven says: "Kinda saaaaad!"
Sadie says: "Do I really sound like that?"
Steven says: "No, no, y-you sing it like it's really a problem for you."
Steven says: "Don't worry, I'll get it, I promise."
Steven says: "*singing to himself* ♪ Squirming in my guts, "I got to sell donuts."
Steven says: "" Big Donut!"
Steven grabs some napkins, scattering a few on the floor, before leaving, and Sadie looks down, contemplating.
Trans. Ext. Fish Stew Pizza, Dusk.
The Cool Kids are waiting by Jenny's Car at the parking lot behind the pizzeria.
Sour Cream says: "I can't believe your car can hold all these amps."
Steven says: "Hey, guys."
Buck says: "Hey~ It's Steven Universe."
Buck says: "Is that the scariest jacket you could find?"
Steven says: "Mmhmm."
Steven says: "Hope it doesn't scare anyone too much."
Jenny says: "So..."
Jenny says: "No Sadie Killer, huh?"
Steven says: "'Fraid not."
Steven says: "She's just..."
Steven says: "too busy with work."
Jenny says: "Aww, man!"
Sour Cream says: "This gig won't be the same without her."
Buck says: "All right, Steven, you're gonna have to up your scary game to fill Sadie's shoes."
Steven says: "Got it!"
Steven says: "*tries to be scary* Rawr!"
Buck says: "You can't help being cute, no more than I can help being cool."
Buck says: "Let's go."
Steven says: "Okay..."
The group gets into Jenny's car and she begins to drive off.
Jenny says: "Buckle up, ya'll."
Sour Cream says: "Hope the seafood at this thing is good."
Jenny says: "So, where is this place exactly?"
Buck says: "I gave you the directions."
Jenny says: "Oh, that tiny piece of paper?"
Jenny says: "*stops the car* Where'd I put it?"
Steven says: "Did it fall under the seat?"
Sour Cream says: "I don't see it back here."
Buck says: "Yo, what if this..."
Buck says: "was all a dream?"
Sadie says: "Hey!"
Just then, Sadie is seen running from behind up to the car.
Sadie says: "Wait up!"
Steven says: "*excitedly* Sadie!"
Jenny says: "*excitedly* Sadie!"
Sadie says: "*catches up to the car, and catches her breath* I can do it!"
Sadie says: "I can do the show!"
Sadie says: "I can come!"
Jenny says: "All right!"
Jenny says: "Yeah!"
Steven says: "*in relief* Oh, thank goodness!"
Sadie says: "*hops onto the car* And I can come to practice, and I can come to the next show, and the show after that!"
Steven says: "But Sadie, don't you have work?"
Sadie says: "Heh!"
Sadie says: "I QUIT!"
Sadie takes off her Big Donut uniform, as the star iris closes in on her smug face.
END.
