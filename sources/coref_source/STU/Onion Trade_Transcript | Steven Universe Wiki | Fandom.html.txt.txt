Open Ext. Beach House.
Amethyst is lounging on a chair, on the porch of the Beach House.
Steven says: "*from inside* Amethyst?"
Steven says: "*exits the house* Have you seen Ranger Guy?"
Amethyst says: "Excuse me?"
Steven says: "Ranger Guy, one of my "G."
Steven says: "U."
Steven says: "Y."
Steven says: "S."
Steven says: ""."
Steven says: "You know, G."
Steven says: "U."
Steven says: "Y."
Steven says: "S."
Steven says: "?"
Amethyst stares cluelessly. Steven starts explaining in a commercial advertising style.
Steven says: "G."
Steven says: "U."
Steven says: "Y."
Steven says: "S."
Steven says: "!!"
Steven says: "Guys, Under, Your, Supervision!!"
Steven says: "There's Ninja Guy, Construction Guy, Cop Guy, Eye Guy, Invisible Guy, Jagged Guy, Cat Guy, Apple Guy, and my main man, Ranger Guy, the best of all the guys, has gone missing."
Steven says: "Have you seen him?"
Pearl says: "What's that I hear?"
Pearl says: "*exits the house too* You can't find one of your little men in that super junky room of yours."
Steven says: "It's not that bad."
Pearl says: "A-hem!"
Pearl opens the window of the house, and a seagull, wearing a banana peel on its head and carrying a slice of pizza, flies out from inside.
Steven says: "How'd that get in there?"
Pearl says: "You left your window wide open for things to just  fly in and out."
Amethyst says: "Aw, give him a break, P."
Amethyst says: "My room's messy, but I always find what I'm looking for."
Pearl says: "Then, why haven't you found my magic axe?"
Amethyst says: "I haven't looked for it yet."
Pearl says: "Amethyst!"
Pearl says: "Go and find it right this second."
Amethyst says: "Hey… feel free to go look for it yourself."
Pearl says: "There's no way I'm going into that dump!"
Steven looks down at his two G.U.Y.S. figurines and walks away.
Amethyst says: "*sighs* Pearl, all your nagging's made Steven depressed."
Pearl says: "Is everything okay, Steven?"
Steven says: "Yeah… I'm fine, just got to break the bad news to my dad."
Trans. It's A Wash.
Steven walks into the car wash to look for Greg.
Steven says: "Dad?"
Steven says: "Daaaddddd!"
Steven says: "?"
Steven says: "*is suddenly sprayed with water* Augh!"
Steven says: "I'm so sorry!"
Greg says: "Yeah, you're sorry, sorry you walked through that door without a hose in your hand!"
Greg says: "*approaches Steven* Ready for battle!"
Greg says: "Aaaah!"
Steven says: "Wait!"
Greg says: "Man, you look sad and wet."
Greg says: "What happened to your life, little guy?"
Steven says: "I… lost something… something precious."
Greg says: "*gasps* Your innocence?!"
Greg says: "!"
Steven says: "I lost Ranger Guy."
Steven says: "One of my G."
Steven says: "U."
Steven says: "Y."
Steven says: "S."
Steven says: "?"
Steven says: "From our special day at the beach last summer?"
Steven says: "You bought him for me at the end of the day."
Steven says: "He was one of a kind."
Steven says: "He had a miscolored hat, how could you not remember?"
Greg says: "*scratches his head* Ahh… Was this the same day we ate that awesome funnel cake?"
Steven says: "Uh… Huh?"
Greg says: "Yeah, man, that funnel cake."
Greg says: "Ha, I even kept the plate."
Greg says: "Come on!"
Greg and Steven walk towards his van and he starts searching inside.
Steven says: "*sees balloons flying out of the van* Cool balloons."
Greg says: "*begins rummaging the van* Ah, let's see here."
Greg says: "Got some cans, napkins, oh, a yo-yo!"
Greg says: "A book about yo-yo tricks, a sandwich I've been meaning to catch up on."
Greg says: "Wait."
Greg says: "What's your story again?"
Steven says: "I lost my special Ranger Guy, and I'm quite upset over it."
Greg says: "Huh, well, here's a bag full of quarters."
Greg says: "*pushes a nearby bag to Steven* Now you can get all the G."
Greg says: "U."
Greg says: "Y."
Greg says: "S."
Greg says: "you want!"
Steven says: "*gasps and whisper-shouts with starry eyes* Thank you!"
Greg says: "What'd you say?"
Steven says: "*yells* THANK YOU!!"
Trans. Funland Arcade.
Steven stands in front of a line of vending machines, the G.U.Y.S. vending machine, specifically.
Steven says: "We'll be reunited soon, Ranger Guy."
Steven says: "Here we go."
G.U.Y.S. Machine says: "Dave Guy!"
Steven says: "What?!"
Steven says: "!"
G.U.Y.S. Machine says: "*dispenses a Dave Guy figure in a plastic capsule* Lucky!"
Steven says: "Not lucky!"
Steven says: "He's like the worst G."
Steven says: "U."
Steven says: "Y."
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "*grabs the dispensed toy* Maybe he comes with something cool."
Steven says: "*opens the capsule and takes out a toy tax form prop* Taxes?"
Steven says: "Come on, Dave Guy, is this all you have to offer?"
Steven says: "A bunch of paperwork?"
Steven says: "Answer me!"
Steven says: "Thank goodness I have all these quarters."
G.U.Y.S. Machine says: "Dave Guy!"
Steven says: "No!"
G.U.Y.S. Machine says: "Dave Guy!"
Steven says: "Stop it!"
G.U.Y.S. Machine says: "Dave Guy!"
Steven says: "Ranger Guy-y-y…!"
G.U.Y.S. Machine says: "This machine is out of G."
G.U.Y.S. Machine says: "U."
G.U.Y.S. Machine says: "Y."
G.U.Y.S. Machine says: "S."
G.U.Y.S. Machine says: "Please try again another time."
Steven says: "*lies on the ground in defeat* It's over."
A snack machine next to the G.U.Y.S. machine starts to rumble and Onion pops out of it with a snack.
Steven says: "Huh?"
Steven says: "Oh, Onion."
Steven says: "What are you doing?"
Steven says: "He's got a Ranger Guy?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "Onion!"
Steven says: "Wait up!"
Steven says: "*packs up all of his Dave Guy in a bag* Let's trade!"
Steven says: "*tries to follow Onion* Which way did he go?"
Trans. Ext. Suitcase Sam's.
Steven sees Onion entering Suitcase Sam's and observes through the window, as Onion haggles with Suitcase Sam.
Steven says: "Oh, I guess he needs a suitcase?"
Steven says: "Is he haggling with that guy?"
Steven says: "He's a tough customer."
Steven says: "Huh?"
Steven says: "Did he get that guy's lunch?"
Steven says: "I wonder how this is gonna play out."
Trans. Beach City Pier.
Steven watches Onion from a distance as he sits on the pier with the bagged lunch. Onion takes out a delicious-looking burger.
Steven says: "Oh, man."
Steven says: "Hey good lookin'…  What the heck is he doing?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "He's not even hungry?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "Oh, not the tomatoes!"
A boat whistle is heard, and a fishing boat pulls into the pier. A bearded man in a yellow raincoat jumps out and greets Onion, lifting him up.
Steven says: "Hey, is that… Onion's dad?"
Onion and Yellowtail communicate via murmurs that Steven cannot understand.
Steven says: "I guess they don't need words."
Yellowtail sets Onion down on the pier and jumps back into his boat. He sails off again as he waves goodbye to his son.
Steven says: "Huh?"
Steven says: "He's leaving so soon?"
Steven says: "Does Onion just..."
Steven says: "sit around and wait for his dad all day?"
Steven says: "*gasps and suddenly remembers* Ranger Guy!"
Steven says: "Okay, let's do this."
Steven approaches Onion on the pier.
Steven says: "Hey, Onion, how are ya?"
Steven says: "Yeah, Ranger Guy!"
Steven says: "How would you like to trade that boring old Ranger Guy for a brand spankin' new, mint in box, Dave Guy?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "*pulls out a Dave Guy from bag* Pretty nice, right?"
Onion shakes his head and makes a beckoning gesture.
Steven says: "Oh, I see where this is going."
Steven says: "You're getting quite the deal here, with TWO Dave Guys!"
Steven says: "But there aren't anymore."
Steven says: "The machine is empty; I bought them all."
Onion starts walking away.
Steven says: "Where are you going?"
Steven says: "Hey!"
Steven says: "Let's work something out!"
Steven says: "Ranger Guuuyyyyy!!"
Trans. Ext. Beach House.
Steven returns to the house while Amethyst is still lounging on the porch.
Steven says: "*frustrated* Ugh, stupid Dave Guy."
Steven says: "Got no future, your hair cut's gross, you smell bad."
Amethyst says: "*laughs* You talking about Pearl?"
Steven says: "No, I'm talking about dumb old Dave Guy."
Steven says: "I mean just look at him."
Steven says: "*pulls out a Dave Guy* Does it look like his life is going anywhere?"
Amethyst says: "Aw, cut him a break."
Amethyst says: "Maybe this is the year he gets his life together."
Amethyst says: "Maybe he'll get a cool internship."
Steven says: "Tsk, I doubt it."
Steven says: "I can't even trade thirty Dave Guys with Onion to get ONE Ranger Guy."
Amethyst says: "So you need more of that little man to get some other little man?"
Steven says: "Yeah, and the machine's sold out of them."
Amethyst pulls out a strange wand from her hair.
Steven says: "What is that?"
Amethyst says: "Pearl's Replicator Wand."
Amethyst says: "You can use it to make copies of stuff."
Amethyst says: "You're magic, I'm sure you can figure out how to use it."
Steven says: "Have you been sitting here all day with this in your hair?"
Amethyst says: "Nah, I got up to look for Pearl's dumb axe but found that instead."
Amethyst says: "Then I replicated a bunch of garbage and stuffed it all in Pearl's Room."
Trans. Beach City Boardwalk.
Onion throws a bunch of ketchup packets on the boardwalk and runs them over with his moped. He performs tricks on it until the moped spins out of control from him. Onion lets go of the moped and it explodes off-screen, erupting a wall of fire in front of him. Steven approaches from behind as Onion takes off his helmet.
Steven says: "Hey, Onion!"
Steven says: "*starts replicating Dave Guy with the wand and shoots another Dave Guy at Onion's feet* That makes 31!"
Steven says: "You want more?"
Steven says: "*shoots more Dave Guys* 31?"
Steven says: "32?"
Steven says: "33?"
Steven says: "34?"
Steven says: "35?"
Steven says: "36?"
Steven says: "37?"
Steven says: "38?"
Steven says: "39?"
Steven says: "40?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "?!"
Steven says: "!"
Onion continues to approach stoically.
Steven says: "ENOUGH!"
Steven says: "What is it that you want?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "You mean, you want this… for Ranger Guy?"
Onion nods. Steven's hand starts shaking nervously. Onion's face slowly becomes wan and ominous, as sirens can be heard in the background.
Trans. Beach.
Steven plays with the newly-traded Ranger Guy on the beach.
Steven says: "We are on the scene with Ranger Guy on Beach Patrol."
Steven says: "*pretends to be Ranger Guy* "Things are looking just great out here, Steven."
Steven says: "" Yup, everything is great… Great…."
Steven says: "*falls backwards on the sand* Were you always this boring, Ranger Guy?"
Steven says: "*as Ranger Guy* "I used to be a doctor."
Steven says: "" Maybe you're just more fun around other—"
Steven says: "Umph!"
Steven says: "… G."
Steven says: "U."
Steven says: "Y."
Steven says: "S."
Steven says: "?"
Steven says: "Dave Guy?"
Steven says: "I thought I saw the last of—"
Another Dave Guy drops on his face, followed by a steady stream of Dave Guy.
Steven says: "Hey, what's the big i—"
Steven says: "*notices massive wave of Dave Guys*—"
Steven says: "dea…?"
Steven says: "*gasps* Oniiooonnnn…!"
Trans. Ext. Funland Arcade.
The Gems approach Onion as he stands atop a massive mountain of Dave Guys, spanning higher than the Funland Arcade building and as wide as the entire Boardwalk, and shoots Dave Guys straight up into the air with the Replicator Wand.
Pearl says: "This is ridiculous."
Pearl says: "How did he get my Replicator?"
Garnet says: "That child should not be in possession of such an item."
Amethyst says: "Aren't these Steven's little men?"
Amethyst says: "*gets hit in the face with a Dave Guy* Oh!"
Steven says: "They're called—"
Steven says: "*emerges from the pile of Dave Guys* G."
Steven says: "U."
Steven says: "Y."
Steven says: "S."
Steven says: "!"
Pearl says: "Can you please explain this mess?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Steven says: "I traded that Replicator for Ranger Guy."
Pearl says: "Steven!"
Pearl says: "Why didn't you just replicate Ranger Guy?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Steven says: "… DANG IT!"
Garnet says: "Let's go before this gets any worse."
Garnet and Pearl leap off.
Amethyst says: "*sinks, waist-deep, into the pile of Dave Guys* Wah!"
Amethyst says: "How do you move in this stuff?"
Steven says: "Try and act like a rich duck."
Amethyst says: "What does that mean?"
Greg says: "*pops up in front of Amethyst* Oh, my gosh, I just wanted some ice cream!"
Amethyst says: "Hi, Greg."
Greg says: "What the heck is going on out here?"
Amethyst says: "Eh, you know, just doing our thing."
Garnet and Pearl attempt to climb the massive pile of Dave Guys capsules to reach Onion.
Garnet says: "Hand it over!"
Garnet says: "It doesn't belong to you."
Onion turns the wand on Garnet and shoots a steady stream of capsules at her, which she blocks with her gauntlet.
Garnet says: "This is not a game."
Onion stops and shoots the wand at a car outside of Garnet and Pearl's field of view.
Pearl says: "What did he shoot?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Onion replicates a car above them.
Garnet says: "Go under!"
She pushes Pearl under the pile and catches the car, but Onion buries her under a pile of cars.
Greg and Amethyst wade through the Dave Guys.
Amethyst says: "Ah, rich duck!"
Steven sneaks up on Onion from below the pile.
Steven says: "Oooon-ioooon!!!"
Steven says: "*tackles Onion off the mountain of Dave Guys and grasps the wand* Oof!"
Steven says: "Onion, please stop!"
Steven says: "Let's trade back."
Steven says: "Take Ranger Guy, he's the best."
Steven says: "He even has a miscolored ha—"
Steven turns the figurine over, notices his own initials on the feet of the toy and gasps.
Steven says: "This is MY Ranger Guy!!"
Steven says: "You traded me my own Guy!!"
Steven says: "Our trade didn't count!"
Steven says: "*takes the wand from Onion and tosses it on ground, attempting to break it* That didn't work."
Pearl says: "*pops up from the pile* I'm never letting Amethyst borrow anything again."
Pearl says: "Garnet!"
Garnet says: "I'm not cleaning up this mess."
All the replicas of cars and Dave Guys begin to disappear a lot of mess.
Steven says: "I think I understand why you took my Ranger Guy, Onion."
Steven says: "I bet you get pretty lonely waiting for your dad all day."
Garnet says: "Let's go."
Amethyst says: "So, all the stuff that got copied turned into nothing?"
Pearl says: "Yep."
Greg then approaches Steven.
Greg says: "That was really cool what you did back there."
Steven says: "Thanks, Dad."
Greg says: "But you went through all that trouble for a toy?"
Steven says: "It was more about the memories than the toy."
Steven says: "Now we have new memories."
Steven says: "Horrible, horrible memories."
Greg says: "Aww."
The camera pans upwards to the air, as the star iris zooms in and ends the episode.
