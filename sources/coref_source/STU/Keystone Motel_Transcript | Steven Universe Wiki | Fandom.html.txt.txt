Open Int. Beach House.
Pearl is seen warping onto the temple Warp Pad, and she flinches when Steven calls out to her.
Steven says: "Pearl!"
Steven says: "Where have you been?"
Pearl says: "Uh, looking for Peridot!"
Pearl says: "..."
Pearl says: "For a few days straight..."
Pearl says: "Steven, I know I might have..."
Pearl says: "disappointed..."
Pearl says: "all of you."
Pearl says: "I know Garnet is very upset with me, but I'm going to prove to her that she can trust me again!"
Garnet then walks in through the front door.
Pearl says: "Oh!"
Pearl says: "Garnet!"
Pearl says: "I was just looking for Peridot!"
Pearl says: "She's bound to be somewhere, right?"
Pearl says: "Any new ideas?"
Pearl says: "I'm sorry..."
Garnet stops walking, and Greg's voice is heard from outside, as he bursts in through the front door.
Greg says: "Who wants to go on a road trip?!"
Greg says: "!"
Greg says: "Umm..."
Greg says: "Is this a bad time?"
Garnet says: "No."
Garnet says: "Please continue."
Greg says: "Well I gotta drive over to the next state, Keystone."
Pearl says: "You mean the Keystone state?"
Greg says: "Right, the state named Keystone."
Greg says: "I met a guy on an internet message board who's selling car wash brushes for real cheap!"
Greg says: "I just gotta meet him in Keystone and pick em' up!"
Steven says: "I don't like those brushes, they feel weird on your fur."
Greg says: "Well, do you like motels?"
Steven says: "Probably!"
Greg says: "Think you'd like to stay at a motel with your favorite dad?"
Steven says: "I don't know if you're my favorite..."
Greg says: "What?"
Greg says: "Huh..."
Greg says: "oh, you kidder!"
Greg says: "Come here!"
Steven says: "*jumps into Greg's arms* I can't wait to get room service!"
Greg says: "You're thinking of a hotel, we're going to a motel."
Greg says: "It'll have a pool, and free ice, and it's right next to The Best Diner in the World!"
Garnet says: "I'm coming too."
Pearl says: "What?"
Steven says: "*gasps* Even better!"
Greg says: "*whispers* Hey, Garnet, I know I'm talking this place up, but..."
Greg says: "it ain't exactly the Ritz."
Garnet says: "*smiling* I'll be the judge of that."
Greg says: "Well in that case..."
Greg says: "road trip!"
Steven says: "ROAD TRIP!"
Garnet says: "*nods head* Road trip."
Pearl says: "Wonderful!"
Pearl says: "I'll make sure Amethyst knows that..."
Pearl says: "Fine!"
Pearl says: "*strains a smile* Well..."
Pearl says: "goodbye!"
Steven says: "This is going to be fun!"
Steven says: "Right, Dad?"
Greg looks at Steven, visibly worried.
Trans. Int. Greg's Van, Sunset.
Greg drives Steven and Garnet out of Beach City in his van through the night. Steven is fast asleep, Greg is tired, and Garnet is wide awake, seemingly unrest.
Trans. Int. Keystone Motel, Night-time.
Greg arrives at the motel and parks his van outside.
Greg says: "Another great thing about motels: *opens the room door* You can drive right up to your door!"
Steven gasps in awe as they look at an ordinary motel room.
Steven says: "I'm gonna swim in the pool, order a movie, get free ice!"
Steven says: "It's gonna be great!"
Greg says: "Not before we check for bed bugs, it isn't!"
Garnet enters the room, carrying their luggage and groaning.
Greg says: "Good news!"
Greg says: "We're bugless!"
Greg says: "Oh!"
Greg says: "That's my cue."
Greg says: "Hey, do you mind holding down the fort until I get back?"
Garnet sits on the other bed, hands on her knees twitching, and gives a thumbs-up.
Greg says: "Great."
Greg says: "I'm going to see a man about a tunnel brush..."
Greg says: "An internet man..."
Greg says: "If I'm not back in an hour, call the police."
Steven says: "Okay!"
Steven says: "Bounce with me Garnet!"
Steven says: "*jumps on the bed* O-or we could look at brochures."
Steven says: "Oh, Keystone Caverns..."
Steven says: "."
Garnet Sapphire.
Garnet Ruby.
Garnet Sapphire.
Garnet Ruby.
Garnet then splits apart, separating into Ruby and Sapphire, who scream as they fall to the floor.
Sapphire says: "*facing away from Ruby* We must move past this, Ruby."
Ruby says: "She lied to us so we'd form Sardonyx!"
Ruby says: "She tricked us; don't you feel used?!"
Ruby says: "!"
Steven says: "*stars in his eyes* Ruby!"
Steven says: "Sapphire!"
Sapphire says: "You're choosing to take it personally."
Ruby says: "*jumping to her feet* It's FUSION, Sapphire!"
Ruby says: "What's more personal to us than FUSION?!"
Ruby says: "!"
Ruby says: "?!"
Ruby says: "!"
Camera shows Steven watching, uncomfortable.
Sapphire says: "I know, you're still upset."
Ruby says: "Oh, so it's just me?"
Sapphire says: "Of course not."
Sapphire says: "*monotone* Can't you see I'm completely engulfed with rage?"
Ruby says: "Well, it doesn't feel like it."
Sapphire says: "*starts to levitate* The sooner we forgive Pearl, the better it will be for us all."
Ruby says: "*yelling* You're..."
Ruby says: "not..."
Ruby says: "as above this..."
Ruby says: "as you..."
Ruby says: "think you are!"
Sapphire says: "*floats onto the bed* Yes, I am."
Ruby paces around the room and gets even angrier.
Sapphire says: "You can't stay angry with her forever."
Ruby says: "*turns and points at Sapphire* Wanna bet?"
Sapphire says: "Ruby, the carpet."
Ruby looks down and sees the carpet burning, with smoke emanating from her feet.
Ruby says: "You..."
Ruby says: "can't even..."
Ruby says: "Argh!"
Ruby storms out of the room and slams the door behind her, leaving burnt footprints on the floor.
Steven says: "Nice to..."
Steven says: "see you again?"
Sapphire says: "Nice to see you, too."
Time-Skip.
Steven exits the room in his bathing suit, towel in hand, and walks towards the pool, following Ruby's footprints. There, he sees Ruby pacing around on the poolside angrily.
Steven says: "*nervously* Hey, Ruby!"
Steven says: "You wanna swim in the pool?"
Ruby says: "It's fusion, Steven!"
Ruby says: "*continues pacing* It's like Sapphire doesn't even care!"
Ruby says: "And we're supposed to be the bigger Gem about this."
Ruby says: "*throws her hands up in the air, shouting* We're ALLLLLLWAYS!"
Ruby says: "- the bigger Gem!"
Ruby says: "Well not this time!"
Ruby says: "Not—"
Ruby says: "about—"
Ruby says: "this!"
Steven says: "Come on, w-why don't you come cool down in the pool?"
Steven says: "Hup!"
Ruby says: "I don't need to "cool down"."
Steven says: "Come on, Ruby!"
Steven says: "The water's niiice~!"
Ruby says: "*hesitates* Why does she always act like I'm being ridiculous?"
Ruby says: "*walks to the bottom of the pool and continues pacing* Just because she wants to pretend like she doesn't have feelings?"
Ruby says: "Oh yeah!"
Ruby says: "I don't have any feelings..."
Steven says: "Uhh, Ruby?"
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "You made a warm spot!"
Steven says: "Uhh..."
Steven says: "I'm gonna go back to the room."
Steven leaves the pool, as Ruby continues to rant underwater. He then returns back into the motel room, now freezing cold, and turns blue with chill.
Steven says: "Phew..."
Steven says: "*shivers and wraps his towel around himself* Sapphire?"
Sapphire says: "Hello, Steven."
Steven says: "*stuttering* A-Are you..."
Steven says: "d-d-doin' ok?"
Sapphire says: "I'm..."
Sapphire says: "fine."
Frost forms on the wall behind Sapphire as she speaks.
Steven says: "Okay..."
Steven says: "*jumps on his bed* Wanna watch TV together?"
Sapphire says: "Sure."
Steven says: "*turns on the TV* Huh..."
Steven says: "T-The channels are all the wrong numbers..."
Steven says: "Hey..."
Steven says: "can you use your future powers to predict what channel I'd love the most?"
Sapphire says: "Hmm..."
Sapphire says: "43."
Sapphire says: "But there's not much on."
Steven switches to the channel and covers himself in the bed blankets, as the frost behind Sapphire grows.
Steven says: "Hey, S-Sapphire?"
Sapphire says: "Even if I do, Ruby won't listen."
Steven says: "Huh?"
Sapphire says: "You're going to say I should talk to Ruby, but it won't help."
Steven says: "B-But she seems really upset."
Sapphire says: "That doesn't matter."
Sapphire says: "We can't stay mad at Pearl forever, and she can't stay mad at me forever, and then she'll come back and see that I'm right."
Steven says: "*shivering, with ice crystals forming on his face* A-A-Are you s-s-sure?"
Sapphire says: "I can see the path of fate as it stretches toward the horizon."
Sapphire says: "Ruby can't avoid the inevitable."
Sapphire says: "She's just letting her emotions get out of hand."
Steven says: "N-N-Not you though?"
Sapphire says: "No."
The frost behind Sapphire intensifies.
Steven says: "I'm..."
Steven says: "going to the bathroom."
Sapphire says: "Also inevitable."
Steven says: "Uhh..."
Steven says: "Sapphire?"
Steven says: "The toilet's frozen..."
Sapphire says: "Such is fate."
Steven says: "*annoyed* Am I fated to pee outside in the grass too?"
Sapphire says: "..."
Sapphire says: "Yes."
Headlights shine upon Steven, as Greg's van pulls over and parks outside the room.
Greg says: "Hey, schtu-ball, I brought dinner!"
Steven says: "Hey Dad, how'd it go?"
Greg says: "Well, he wasn't an axe-murderer, so that was good."
Greg says: "What are you doing outside in your bathing suit?"
Greg says: "And where's Garnet?"
Greg peeks in the room and sees Sapphire sitting on the bed, surrounded in frost.
Sapphire says: "He's not gonna like that it's square..."
Greg says: "*quickly closes the door* Oh boy..."
Greg says: "Where's the other one?"
Steven says: "She's pacing around in what used to be the pool."
Ruby is seen still pacing around the bottom of the pool, now steaming with no water.
Greg says: "Something pretty serious must be going on if it made Garnet split up."
Greg says: "*sits in the back of his van* But hey!"
Greg says: "We can still have a good time!"
Steven says: "SQUARE PIZZA?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "What's wrong with this crazy state?!"
Steven says: "!"
Greg says: "Son, there will come a time in your life when you learn to accept all pizza."
Steven says: "*takes a pizza cut* Why can't Ruby and Sapphire just..."
Steven says: "make up?"
Greg says: "Sometimes people that love each other can hurt each other's feelings without meaning to."
Greg says: "We should just give them some space."
Steven says: "But I think they'd work it out if they'd just talk to each other!"
Greg says: "Everything will be better in the morning."
Greg says: "We'll all go to The Best Diner in the World, where we'll eat the best breakfast in the world!"
Steven says: "You think that'll help?"
Greg says: "Nothing like a little breakfast to bring people together!"
Steven says: "You really are my favorite dad."
Greg says: "*takes a pizza cut too* I knew this pizza would put me over the top..."
Trans Int. The Best Diner in the World, The Next Day.
Steven, Greg, Ruby, and Sapphire are sitting at a table. Steven is playing with a spoon, Greg is whistling awkwardly, Ruby leans on the table, facing away from Sapphire and angrily tapping a finger, while Sapphire is sitting patiently and quietly. A waitress then brings four breakfast plates.
Greg says: "Hey!"
Greg says: "Thank you!"
Steven says: "Thanks!"
Ruby stares blankly at the breakfast plate in front of her, with eggs, bacon and a strawberry arranged into smiling faces.
Greg says: "What's the matter?"
Greg says: "Not hungry?"
Steven says: "Gems don't need to eat, Dad."
Greg says: "Eh..."
Greg says: "Well Garnet likes to eat sometimes."
Ruby says: "ARGH!"
Ruby says: "Well Garnet's not here!"
Steven and Greg awkwardly begin to eat.
Greg says: "*nervously* Mmm..."
Greg says: "Oh boy, this really is "The Best Diner in the World"!"
Ruby starts to shake the table impatiently.
Sapphire says: "You're shaking the table."
Ruby says: "*bangs the table and continues shaking it."
Ruby says: "* Hah, I'M kinda surprised you felt anything at all, to be honest!"
Sapphire says: "I didn't need to feel, I saw."
Ruby says: "EVERYTHING IS JUST SO..."
Ruby says: "CRYSTAL - CLEAR - TO - YOU - ISN'T IT?!"
Ruby says: "!"
Ruby says: "?!"
Ruby says: "!"
Ruby begins to shake the table violently, causing Steven and Greg to frantically lift their plates off the table.
Sapphire says: "*leans to Steven and Greg* This will pass."
Sapphire says: "She'll eventually just burn herself out."
Ruby says: "THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK!"
Ruby says: "*summons her gauntlet* I AM AN ETERNAL FLAME, BABY!!!!"
Ruby smashes the table with her gauntlet, causing it to flip over and everything to spill off it.
Ruby says: "*argues with Sapphire* You don't know me!"
Sapphire says: "*argues with Ruby * How could I possibly not know you, we always fuse—"
Ruby says: "Look at you!"
Ruby says: "Awww-haw-haw."
Sapphire says: "We always fuse."
Sapphire says: "Look at you."
Sapphire says: "Look at what you're going on about..."
Ruby says: "YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOURSELF!"
Ruby says: "HAH!"
As Ruby and Sapphire argues in the background, Steven sees one of the breakfasts has turned into a frown. He then starts tearing up in dismay.
Greg says: "*smiling nervously at Steven* Hey, it's okay pal!"
Greg says: "We can still save this!"
Ruby says: "YOU’RE JUST A..."
Ruby says: "A.."
Sapphire says: "Yes?"
Sapphire says: "Yes?"
Steven drops his plate onto the floor, Ruby and Sapphire immediately stop arguing, and storms outside with tears in his eyes.
Greg says: "Aww jeez..."
Ruby and Sapphire look at each other and chases after Steven outside.
Ruby says: "Steven!"
Sapphire says: "Steven!"
Steven says: "I was so happy when Garnet said she was gonna come on this trip with me and Dad!"
Steven says: "Home's been awful!"
Steven says: "Here's been awful!"
Steven says: "I thought you wanted to have a fun time but, everyone's been acting awful too!"
Steven says: "It-It just came with us!"
Steven says: "I don't understand!"
Steven says: "Is it..."
Steven says: "is it me?"
Ruby says: "No!"
Ruby says: "Steven, it's all us!"
Sapphire says: "But we made him feel..."
Sapphire says: "like it was his fault."
Sapphire says: "*holds her hand over her mouth* I keep looking into the future, when all of this has already been solved..."
Sapphire says: "As if it doesn't matter how you feel in the present..."
Sapphire says: "*starts to cry* No wonder you think I don't care!"
Ruby says: "Sapphire..."
Ruby says: "No, no no no no no no no!"
Ruby says: "This is all my fault!"
Ruby says: "I-I didn't want to look for a solution, I-I just wanted to be mad!"
Ruby says: "Y-You're right!"
Ruby says: "You're always right!"
Ruby says: "I was being stupid!"
Sapphire says: "I don't think you're stupid!"
Ruby says: "I'm..."
Ruby says: "sorry..."
Ruby brushes Sapphire's hair to the side, revealing a single crying blue eye.
Sapphire says: "You honestly think I'm not upset about what happened?"
Sapphire says: "I was just..."
Sapphire says: "trying to do the right thing..."
Ruby says: "I know..."
Sapphire sighs and holds Ruby's hand against her cheek.
Ruby says: "*smiling* You know what's nice about being split up?"
Sapphire says: "What?"
Ruby says: "I get to look at you."
Ruby grins, and Sapphire pushes her away, scoffing and laughing.
Sapphire says: "*laughing* Be serious!"
Ruby says: "*hugs Sapphire* There's my Laughy Sapphy!"
Sapphire says: "*blushes* Shh!"
Sapphire says: "You're embarrassing me in front of Steven!"
Steven looks away, embarrassed. Ruby and Sapphire continues laughing and giggling, as Ruby throws Sapphire into the air, catches her and kisses her on the cheek and neck. Steven blushes, covers his eyes, lays on the ground, and sighs.
Greg says: "*walks up to Steven* Well, I paid for breakfast..."
Greg says: "And the damage to the booth..."
Greg says: "Anywho, I think I'm all vacationed out."
Greg says: "Ready to call it a day?"
Steven takes a breath, as if he is going to say something, when he is interrupted by Ruby and Sapphire fusing.
Garnet says: "*smiling and adjusting her visors* Not before we get our free ice."
Steven says: "*starry eyed* Garnet!"
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Steven says: "We're home!"
Steven and Greg enter the house, holding a bag of ice. Pearl, looking sad, is seen talking to Amethyst with her hand on Pearl's knee.
Pearl says: "I just don't know why I keep-  *notices Steven and Greg* Oh!"
Pearl says: "Uh- You look like you all had fun!"
Steven says: "Yeah!"
Steven says: "It all worked out!"
Garnet is seen standing behind them.
Pearl says: "Garnet, how are you?"
Garnet says: "*holds up her hand* Not now."
Pearl says: "She's speaking to me again..."
Pearl says: "Kind of."
Greg says: "That really was a great trip."
Steven says: "*gasps* Can we go back?"
Greg says: "Maybe one day..."
Greg says: "*ruffles Steven's hair* But, not to that diner!"
Greg says: "Oh boy..."
END.
