Open Ext. It's A Wash, Sunset.
Steven, Connie and Greg are sorting boxes of vinyl disk collection from Greg's van outside the car wash.
Steven says: "*takes out three vinyl disks from a box* Here's all the Orange Magic Orchestra ones."
Greg says: "Great!"
Greg says: "Put them in the transcendental space rock-pile."
Connie says: "*taking a vinyl disk* At home, we only have classical music and movie soundtracks."
Connie says: "I've never heard any of these."
Greg says: "You've never heard the Philosophy Majors?"
Greg says: "Oh man, give it here."
Greg says: "*takes the disk from Connie and puts in on a player* This'll really knock your socks off."
The music starts playing. Steven starts dancing to the tune while Greg air-guitars.
Steven says: "*laughs and offers his hand to Connie* Come on!"
Connie says: "Whoa!"
Steven and Connie are dancing and twirling around together. Steven's gem then starts glowing and the two accidentally fuse into Stevonnie. They stop dancing and see a shocked Greg staring at them. Greg stops the music and Stevonnie quickly separates back into Steven and Connie.
Greg says: "You two can fuse?!"
Greg says: "!"
Steven says: "Uh..."
Steven says: "Yes?"
Greg says: "Uh, huh, that's incredible!"
Greg says: "Since when?"
Greg says: "Wait, how is this even possible?"
Connie says: "Please don't tell my parents, Mr."
Connie says: "Universe!"
Connie says: "They don't know I've been doing magic stuff with Steven!"
Greg says: "Whoa, whoa, it's..."
Greg says: "it's okay."
Greg says: "I may be the only human being on the planet who's gonna understand."
Connie says: "Wha- what do you mean?"
Steven says: "*gets suspicious* Yeah, what do you mean?"
Greg says: "Well..."
Steven says: "*gasps* Story!"
Steven says: "Come on!"
Steven and Connie jump into and sit inside the van.
Steven says: "We're ready."
Greg says: "I didn't think I'd be telling this so soon."
Greg says: "Probably best to start with this."
Greg retrieves a VHS tape, inserts it in the VCR TV and plays it, leading to a full flashback to the 90's.
Open Int. Crystal Temple.
The TV screen flickered with static and then showed a young Greg adjusting the camera. A backdrop of wooden planks and lit light bulbs was seen, along with the Warp Pad, used as the stage. Garnet, Amethyst and Rose Quartz were seen standing on-stage, with a keytar, drums, and a microphone respectively.
Greg says: "Everybody ready?"
Greg says: "*run in front of the stage with his guitar* One, two, three, four."
Greg and the Crystal Gems started to play "What Can I Do For You". Greg inched in on the stage to be closer to Rose.
RoseGreg says: "What can I do for you?"
RoseGreg says: "What can I do that no one else can do?"
RoseGreg says: "What can I do for you?"
RoseGreg says: "What can I do for you?"
Rose says: "Human man."
Rose says: "You are so much fun."
Rose says: "I hadn't planned on finding you,Quite this entertaining."
Rose says: "I like your band..."
Garnet says: "Woo!"
Rose says: "..."
Rose says: "And I like your song."
Rose says: "I like the way."
Rose says: "Human beings play."
Rose says: "I like playing along."
Rose says: "Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh~!"
RoseGreg says: "What can I do for you?"
RoseGreg says: "What can I do that no one else can do?"
RoseGreg says: "What can I do for you?"
RoseGreg says: "What can I do for you?"
Greg started playing a guitar solo, while a bitter Pearl watched as she leaned against the wood planks. She then smirked, walked up to Rose and whispered into her ear. Rose and Pearl walked off stage and started dancing together, fusing into Rainbow Quartz. She continued to dance, glaring at Greg, still playing his guitar solo, and then unfused on the warp pad. After they separated back into Rose and Pearl, Pearl held out the microphone and dropped it in front of Greg with a devilish look on her face, ending the song.
Greg says: "I can't believe I got that on video!"
Greg says: "*turns off the stage lights with an effects pedal* What on Earth was that?!"
Greg says: "!"
Rose says: "That was Rainbow Quartz."
Rose says: "Pearl thought a fusion might give your video a little something extra."
Rose says: "Pretty cool, right?"
Rose says: "*kisses Greg* I have to go, but- Are you doing anything later?"
Greg says: "You know I'm not."
Rose says: "*laughs* You're adorable, Mr."
Rose says: "Universe."
Amethyst says: "*pops up behind Greg* Hey, I hit the drums, so pay up."
Greg handed over a bag of Pop-Pop-brand popcorn to Amethyst.
Greg says: "Here you go."
Amethyst grabbed the bag in her teeth and shook her head wildly like a dog. She then popped it open with her hands.
Pearl says: "*twirls the microphone playfully* You're just a phase."
Pearl says: "You know that, right?"
Greg says: "*sighs exasperatedly* No, I actually don't know that, Pearl."
Pearl says: "Oh, of course you don't."
Pearl says: "You don't know anything about Rose."
Greg says: "I know she's super into me!"
Pearl says: "*condescendingly* Listen, Mr."
Pearl says: "Universe."
Pearl says: "Rose may find you charming, but that's only because you're human."
Pearl says: "You're a novelty, at best."
Greg says: "What makes you so sure?"
Amethyst popped over behind Greg, eating the popcorn.
Pearl says: "Well, that's simple!"
Pearl says: "Humans can't fuse!"
Pearl says: "*sing-songy* Fusion is the ultimate connection between Gems."
Pearl says: "And you..."
Pearl says: "are not..."
Pearl says: "a gem!"
Pearl puts the coiled microphone cable around Greg's neck and flicks his hair playfully, causing him to blush angrily. She then continues to prance in front of him.
Greg says: "*takes off the cable* Well, has any human ever tried fusing with a gem?"
Pearl says: "*stunned* Uhh, noo?"
Pearl says: "I don't think so."
Greg says: "Well then, I will try!"
Amethyst says: "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOHO!"
Pearl just sighed exasperatedly, rolling her eyes at Greg, and walked away.
Greg says: "*picks up the microphone* Aw geez, what am I doing?"
Greg says: "These things are expensive."
Trans. Ext. Crystal Temple, Evening.
Greg started re-watching the recorded tape of Pearl and Rose's fusion dance at the back of his van. He tried to copy Pearl's dance moves, but failed and fell onto the ground.
Greg says: "Oh geez, how'd she get her legs to do that?"
Greg says: "*lies on the ground* Ugh..."
Amethyst says: "Hey!"
Amethyst says: "*pops in with Garnet behind her* Are you dead?"
Greg says: "Wha?"
Greg says: "*sitting upright* Oh, no no, I'm alive."
Amethyst says: "Whoa, cool!"
Amethyst says: "*runs up to the TV set* It's us from before!"
Greg says: "Yeah, I was just trying to get my head around this fusion dance."
Amethyst says: "A fusion dance ain't about your head!"
Greg says: "Wait, you guys are Gems."
Greg says: "You gotta help me out here, I need to be able to fuse with Rose."
Garnet says: "First you need a gem at the core of your being."
Garnet says: "Then you need a body that can turn into light."
Garnet says: "Then you need a partner you can trust with that light."
Greg says: "Metaphorically?"
Garnet says: "Literally."
Amethyst says: "*whispers to Garnet* Shh!"
Amethyst says: "Come on, I still wanna see him try!"
Greg says: "Ugh, so it's true."
Greg says: "I really can't do it."
Greg says: "I'm kidding myself with this, I'm never gonna be a Gem."
Garnet says: "*sees a small stick on the ground and picks it up* Amethyst, give us some privacy!"
Amethyst says: "Yeaaaaah!!!"
Garnet says: "Let me tell you something, Mr."
Garnet says: "Universe."
Garnet says: "*kneels down* I think you can do it, but it won't work if you dance like Pearl."
Garnet says: "You have to dance like you."
Garnet says: "You have to fuse your way."
Garnet says: "*puts her hand on Greg's shoulder reassuringly* Get open, get honest, invent yourselves together."
Garnet says: "*pulls down her visor, showing off her three eyes, and winks* That's fusion."
Greg says: ""Eye..."
Greg says: "!"
Greg says: "" I..."
Greg says: "think I get it."
Garnet put her visor back on and smiled widely.
Time Skip â€” Night-time.
Greg, wearing a smart blazer, stood alone on the beach next to his van and a makeshift dance floor, made of the same wooden planks covered in light bulbs. He heard the warp pad activating and quickly smoothed out his hair. He then put on a record, as Rose appeared behind him.
Rose says: "*laughs* What's all this?"
Greg turned and walked up to Rose on the dance floor. They both held hands and began dancing together. Greg then stepped on an effects pedal and lit up the light bulbs on the dance floor. The two continued dancing until Greg stepped onto a stereo to gain some height, so that the two could share a passionate kiss. Shocked by this gesture, Rose's pupils turned starry. Greg, however, seemed disappointed.
Greg says: "We..."
Greg says: "We didn't fuse."
Rose says: "WHAT!"
Rose says: "?"
Rose says: "*laughing hysterically* You can't fuse!"
Rose says: "You are a human!"
Greg says: "I know!"
Greg says: "That's the problem!"
Greg says: "I'm just a human."
Rose says: "That's not a problem!"
Rose says: "I love humans!"
Rose says: "You're all so funny!"
Greg grimaced at Rose's comment, seemingly heartbroken.
Greg says: "Look..."
Rose says: "*seductively* Oh, yes."
Greg says: "..."
Greg says: "but I'm getting a little worried about the future."
Rose says: "Oh!"
Rose says: "Just ask Garnet."
Greg says: "I'm starting to wonder if you..."
Greg says: "respect me?"
Rose says: "*starts laughing again* Oh, you're hilarious, Mr."
Rose says: "Universe."
Greg says: "Rose, please!"
Greg says: "-TALK TO ME FOR ONE SECOND!"
Greg says: "?"
Greg says: "LIKE A REAL PERSON!"
Greg says: "?"
Rose abruptly stopped laughing, startled and shocked. The track on the record then changed into a more somber tune.
Rose says: "..."
Rose says: "I'm..."
Rose says: "not..."
Rose says: "a real person..."
Rose says: "I thought..."
Rose says: "Haven't we..."
Rose says: "Is this not how it works?"
Greg says: "*dazed* Oh..."
Greg says: "oh boy..."
Greg says: "this is so weird, you really are an alien..."
Rose says: "Why are you laughing?"
Greg then broke down into tears, still laughing.
Rose says: "Why are you crying?"
Greg says: "How are we gonna make this work?"
Rose says: "Fusion?"
Greg says: "No, us."
Greg says: "We're really, really different."
Rose says: "What do we do now?"
Greg says: "..."
Greg says: "Let's just..."
Greg says: "talk."
Greg and Rose then hugged each other.
Greg says: "I barely know you."
Rose says: "That's a good thing."
Greg says: "We really rushed into this."
Rose says: "Everything on Earth seems fast to me."
Greg says: "Do you..."
Greg says: "miss your home planet?"
Rose says: "No, never."
Greg says: "How'd you end up with, uh, Harpo, Groucho, and Chico?"
Rose quickly realized Greg is referring to Garnet, Pearl and Amethyst, who had been watching the two this whole time.
Rose says: "Huh?"
Rose says: "Oh, them?"
Rose says: "Those are three long stories."
Amethyst, in plain sight, waved at Rose and Greg. Pearl peeked out from behind a hand rock, behind ducking back in hiding with Garnet.
Pearl says: "What are they doing?"
Garnet says: "Shh."
Greg says: "Have you..."
Greg says: "loved..."
Greg says: "other humans?"
Rose says: "Have you?"
Greg says: "Yes."
Rose says: "Yes."
Greg says: "Have you ever been..."
Greg says: "in love..."
Greg says: "with a human?"
Rose says: "How would I know?"
Greg says: "It's torture."
Rose stepped away from Greg, his face sweaty from nervousness.
Rose says: "Greg..."
Greg says: "*shivers intensely* R-rose?"
Rose says: "Is this torture?"
Greg says: "The worst."
Rose says: "I'm so sorry..."
Greg says: "Huh?"
Greg says: "No, don't be!"
Rose says: "What!"
Rose says: "?"
Rose says: "Why not!"
Rose says: "?"
Rose says: "Oooh, I'm so confused..."
Greg says: "*chuckles* Me too!"
Rose says: "Well!"
Rose says: "U-uh, this is good!"
Rose says: "We've got one thing in common!"
Greg says: "Ha!"
Rose lifted Greg off the stereo, and they began dancing and laughing again.
Pearl says: "Why are they still dancing!"
Pearl says: "?"
Pearl says: "I-it didn't work!"
Garnet says: "Yes it did."
Pearl says: "What!"
Pearl says: "?"
Garnet says: "It worked."
The record tune changed to a jazzy one.
Amethyst says: "I think this one's my favorite."
Pearl says: "*saddened*..."
Pearl says: "I think he's her favorite too."
Rose and Greg continued dancing and twirling, as the flashback concludes.
Trans. Ext. It's A Wash.
The flashback ends, returning back Steven and Connie in Greg's van, both blushing heavily.
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "Whoa."
Connie says: "So you guys were never able to fuse?"
Greg says: "Ah, no, but that wasn't as important as talking to each other."
Greg says: "Look..."
Greg says: "humans and Gems..."
Greg says: "it's still some pretty new territory."
Greg says: "You're gonna have to work it out together."
Greg says: "And Connie?"
Greg says: "If you ever need to talk to another human being about this, you can always talk to me."
Connie says: "Mm."
Greg says: "*holds up his hand* Human beings?"
Connie says: "*high-fives Greg* Human beings."
Steven says: "*clutches his gem* Human beings."
