Open Int. Little Homeworld.
Steven is seen warping into Little Homeworld by acting a commercial.
Steven says: "Hey, all you Gems out there in the universe!"
Steven says: "Have you been feeling lost and confused in this new era?"
Steven says: "Then come on down to Little Homeschool!"
Steven says: "Are you used to destroying things?"
Steven says: "Then learn to be constructive instead!"
Steven says: "Are you used to plotting?"
Steven says: "Then you can tend to this plot of land!"
Steven says: "Feeling lost without direction from the Diamonds?"
Steven says: "Come and find your center."
Steven says: "Everyone deserves a chance to change, so come on down today!"
Steven says: "And, cut."
Steven says: "*picks up the camera* Thanks for helping update our commercial, guys."
Larimar says: "I'm an actor."
Steven says: "I'll get this home and do some editing."
Peridot says: "Steven, you smell good."
Steven says: "Uh, what?"
Peridot says: "It's written on your back."
Steven says: "Huh?"
The writing on Steven's back says "Tell Me I Smell Good".
Peridot says: "*laughs* You obviously wrote this yourself."
Steven says: "No, I didn't."
Steven says: "*slurps tomato soup* Mnh!"
Steven says: "Bleh!"
Steven says: "Tomato soup?"
Peridot says: "I thought you loved tomato soup!"
Steven says: "Yeah, but..."
Steven says: "where'd my juice go?"
Steven says: "*sees toilet paper on Steven's car* Oh, no!"
Steven says: "The Dondai's been, um..."
Steven says: "kinda covered in toilet paper?"
Steven hears someone laugh mysteriously.
Steven says: "Hey!"
Steven says: "Whoever you are that's "pranking me," you've got a really weird idea of what a prank is."
Steven says: "*sighs* At least I don't have to pick up more toilet paper."
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Steven drives in to his house who plays Haven't You Noticed I'm a Star.
Steven says: "Hmm?"
Steven says: "Whoa, another welcome party."
Steven says: "A new Gem must've arrived."
Trans. Int. Living Room.
Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl let Steven join in.
Amethyst says: "Yo, dude, come over here and introduce yourself."
Steven says: "Welcome to Earth!"
Short Fusion Gem says: "*cockney accent* Well, well, well, if it ain't the old Gem savior himself, Steven Universe!"
Steven notices that "Eyeball" and Aquamarine knows about fusion.
Bluebird says: "Bluebird Azurite, at your service!"
Bluebird says: "All right, give us a hug then!"
Steven says: "Oh!"
Steven says: "Heh."
Garnet says: "Cute."
Bluebird says: "Mmm."
Bluebird says: "Oh!"
Bluebird says: "You like food, yeah?"
Steven says: "Yeah?"
Bluebird says: "Well, sit tight, then."
Bluebird says: "I'll be right back!"
Steven says: "What?!"
Steven says: "!"
Pearl says: "Yeah, she just got here and is already exploring Earth cuisine."
Bluebird flies back.
Steven says: "What is this?"
Bluebird says: "Just some old Earth things."
Bluebird says: "Clams, peanut butter, and a side of fresh cut grass."
Bluebird says: "*begs* Please enjoy it."
Bluebird says: "I'm begging you."
Bluebird says: "Please!"
Amethyst says: "Gosh, Steven, don't make her beg."
Steven says: "S-Sure!"
Steven says: "Heh."
Steven says: "I'll just, uh..."
Steven says: "dip this here..."
Steven says: "."
Steven says: "*eats the fresh cut grass* Mmm."
Bluebird says: "*offscreen* Is is good?"
Steven says: "Yeah, it- it's great."
Bluebird says: "*laughs* Brilliant."
Steven says: "Can I see you guys in the bathroom?"
Trans. Int. Steven's Bathroom.
Greg brushes his hair and Steven knocks on the door.
Steven says: "Sorry, Dad."
Steven says: "Emergency meeting."
Steven says: "Don't panic."
Steven says: "I think Bluebird is a fusion of Aquamarine and "Eyeball"!"
Amethyst says: "Well, duh."
Garnet says: "It's pretty obvious."
Steven says: "What?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "Well, how come you're all so calm about this?"
Steven says: "Did you forget that Aquamarine kidnapped me?"
Steven says: "How about the fact that "Eyeball" tried to stab me and ratted me out while I was on trial?"
Steven says: "They must've fused because they both hate me!"
Garnet says: "That was them."
Garnet says: "This is Bluebird."
Steven says: "But she pranked me earlier today!"
Steven says: "She put a sign on my back that said I..."
Steven says: "smelled good, switched my juice with tomato soup, neatly stack toilet paper..."
Steven says: "on top of my car?"
Pearl says: "None of that stuff sounds particularly malicious."
Amethyst says: "Besides, don't you like tomato soup?"
Steven says: "Yeah, but isn't it convenient that Bluebird just showed up here at my house?"
Pearl says: "Steven, you've literally invited all problematic Gems from across the universe to come here and learn a better way of living."
Steven says: "Well, right."
Greg says: "Listen, Schtu-ball, if you don't want this Gem around, that's totally fair."
Steven says: "No, you guys are right."
Steven says: "Everyone deserves a chance to change."
Garnet says: "Don't worry."
Garnet says: "If she tries anything funny, we'll be there to squash her."
Steven says: "Thanks, Garnet."
Trans. Int. Living Room.
Steven says: "Hey, Bluebird!"
Steven says: "What's up?"
Bluebird says: "Steven Universe!"
Bluebird says: "I'm sorry."
Bluebird says: "I gave you all that food without something to, uh, wash it down with."
Steven says: "Okay, thank you!"
Steven's juice squirts on Steven.
Bluebird says: "How'd that 'appen?"
Steven says: "You obviously shook it."
Garnet says: "*clears throat* Chance to change."
Garnet says: "A-hem: Steven: You obviously shook it..."
Garnet says: "by accident."
Bluebird giggles.
Trans. Ext. Beach House.

Steven says: "..."

Steven says: "Bluebird's got a knife!"
Pearl says: "How else are we gonna cut this cake she made for you?"
Bluebird says: "Surprise!"
Trans. Int. Little Homeworld.

Steven says: "Wha?"
Steven says: "Bluebird's got Garnet pinned!"
Steven says: "Let Garnet go RIGHT NOW!"

Bluebird says: "It's very important to stretch!"
Trans. Int. Beach House.

Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "Ugh."
Amethyst says: "What's up, dude?"
Steven says: "Bluebird's really getting to me."
Steven says: "I mean, look at this terrible drawing she made of me."
Steven says: "These, too!"
Steven says: "I've been finding this junk all over the place."
Amethyst says: "Steven, those are my drawings!"
Steven says: "Amethyst, I'm sorry!"
Bluebird says: "What's with the waterworks, love?"
Amethyst says: "My art career is over before it even got off the ground!"
Bluebird says: "I don't know what art is, but this is the best art I've ever seen!"
Amethyst says: "Awww, thanks, Bluebird!"
Amethyst says: "I'm gonna work on my art right now!"
Amethyst says: "You wanna come?"

Trans. Int. It's a Wash.
Steven says: "Hey, Dad!"
Steven hears Greg yelling.
Steven says: "Dad, are you okay?!"
Steven says: "!"
Greg says: "What's up, Schtu-ball?"
Greg says: "Just showin' Bluebird some of my old classic sci-fi horror movies."
Bluebird says: "Yeah!"
Bluebird says: "They're hilarious!"
Greg says: "So, what're you doin' over here?"
Greg says: "Got somethin' on your mind?"
Steven says: "You know what, Dad?"
Steven says: "I think I'll be okay."
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Steven wakes up and yawns. He looks at himself in the mirror and sees his face with scribble marks of Bluebird's gemstones.
Steven says: "Huh?"
Steven says: "Oh, Bluebird, classic prank."
The Warp Pad whooshes, tires squealing.
Steven says: "What!"
Steven says: "?"
Steven says: "Huh?"
Steven says: "How'd the van..."
Steven says: "?"
Steven says: "Oh, gotcha."
Steven says: "Welp, I guess Bluebird and Dad must be having a ball together."
Greg says: "*offscreen* AAAH!"
Steven says: "Sounds like they're watching another horror movie."
Steven says: "I'm sure everything's just fine."
Greg says: "*offscreen* Heeeeelp!!"
Steven says: "O-Okay, Steven."
Steven says: "Your dad is fine."
Steven says: "Bluebird is cool."
Steven says: "Dad?"
Greg says: "*offscreen* Up here, son!!"
Steven says: "A-Are those screams of fun?!"
Steven says: "!"
Greg says: "NO!!"
Bluebird says: "An era ago, there were two Gems celebrated for taking down Homeworld's greatest traitor."
Bluebird says: "But then, they were cast out, forgotten, when the traitor duped all of Homeworld into loving him instead."
Bluebird says: "Now, they've come to Earth for their revenge!"
Aquamarine says: "Aquamarine!"
And Ruby!
Aquamarine says: "Well?!"
Aquamarine says: "!"
Aquamarine says: "It's us!"
It's always been us, and you never knew!
Steven says: "I always knew."
Steven says: "Everyone knew."
Aquamarine says: "What?!"
Aquamarine says: "!"
If you knew, they why were your Gems bein' so nice to us, huh?!
Steven says: "That's 'cause they're nice!"
Steven says: "They're nice people!"
Aquamarine says: "Enough of this!"
Steven says: "Whoa!"
Steven says: "Hey, careful with my dad!"
Steven says: "If this is another one of your pranks, you'd better cut it out!"
That was just us softening you up! Now, the real torture begins!
Aquamarine says: "We've learned so much about your life, Steven."
Aquamarine says: "Especially how much you love your precious "My-Dad"."
Aquamarine says: "But, if you want him back, you'll have to do us a favor or two, such as..."
Aquamarine says: "destroying your house!"
Yeah!
Aquamarine says: "Bubble your friends!"
Yeah!
Aquamarine says: "And burn Little Homeworld to the ground!"
DO IT!
Steven says: "No!"
Aquamarine says: "Then "My-Dad" gets it!"
Gets what?
Aquamarine says: "Gets hurt."
Aquamarine says: "Just do what we saw in that movie."
Oh, yeah! *laughs maliciously*.
Greg says: "..."
Greg says: "Aah!"
Greg says: "That's enough!"
Hey!
Greg swipes "Eyeball"'s chisel knife and cuts his hair and falls.
Steven says: "No!!"
Aquamarine says: "What!"
Aquamarine says: "?"
Steven catches Greg.
Steven says: "Dad, are you okay?"
Aquamarine says: "Ugh!"
Aquamarine says: "Disgusting!"
Greg says: "*whimpering* Oh, my baby!"
Aquamarine says: "*offscreen* How could you let that happen?"
Aquamarine says: "*offscreen* I was directing you!"
Steven says: "Father, go inside."
Greg goes inside. Steven turns pink.
Steven says: "I WON'T LET YOU GET AWAY WITH THIS!"
Steven jumps up and fights "Eyeball" and Aquamarine.
Aquamarine says: "We have to fuse if we're going to beat him."
What was that?!
Aquamarine says: "You were uncoordinated."
Aquamarine says: "Try again!"
That's it! I've had it with you!
Steven says: "Tsk, tsk, tsk."
Steven says: "You guys fused just because you hate me, didn't you?"
"Eyeball" says: "Yes!"
Aquamarine says: "Yes!"
Steven says: "If that's the only reason, then it's no wonder you can't keep it together."
Aquamarine says: "What are you talking about?"
Steven says: "There are so many other reasons to fuse, like friendship and responsibility..."
Steven says: "and love."
Steven says: "Imagine how much better it would feel to fuse to support each other instead of tearing someone down."
Wowie, wow! He is so annoying!
Aquamarine says: "I hate him so much!"
"Eyeball" says: "I know!"
Aquamarine says: "I know!"
"Eyeball" says: "Me too!"
Aquamarine says: "Me too!"
Steven says: "Are you kidding me?"
Bluebird says: "Back at last!"
Steven summons his shield.
Bluebird says: "En garde!"
Swords whooshing. Bluebird fight Steven.
Pearl says: "Steven, why is Greg crying in the bathroom?"
Amethyst says: "Tell him he's gotta move his dang va- AAAAAAH!!!!"
Bluebird says: "DIE!"
Bluebird says: "DIE!"
Bluebird says: "DIE!"
Bluebird says: "DIE!"
Bluebird says: "DIE!"
Bluebird says: "DIE!"
Bluebird says: "- Now, if it isn't my favorite trio."
They fuse into Alexandrite.
Bluebird says: "Oh, no."
Alexandrite slaps Bluebird into the ground. They unfuse.
Steven says: "Are you two okay?"
Aquamarine says: "Oh, we've been defeated."
Yep.
Aquamarine says: "I've completely learned my lesson."
Huh?
Aquamarine says: "I'm sorry, Steven."
Aquamarine says: "Accept my apology?"
Aquamarine says: "*swipe* Gotcha!"
Aquamarine says: "*laughs* You may have gotten us this time, but we'll be out there."
Hating you!
Aquamarine says: "Forever!"
You smelllll....! *disappears into the sky*.
Amethyst says: "I guess, there really are Gems out there that hate you."
Steven says: "Yep, but I'm not the one they hurt."
Gren sits on the shore, coping with his loss.
Steven says: "I'm really sorry, Dad."
Steven says: "I never should have given Bluebird a chance."
Greg says: "*sighs* I love how you believe in everyone."
Greg says: "You stuck to your principles, and I'm proud of you."
Greg says: "I mean, everyone can change, but not everyone wants to."
Steven says: "Yeah."
Greg says: "*lets lost hair flow into the ocean* Goodbye, old pal."
Greg says: "You're finally free."
END.
