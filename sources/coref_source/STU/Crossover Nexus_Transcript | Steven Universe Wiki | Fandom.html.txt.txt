Strike says: "Come out, come out wherever you are."
Strike says: "I summoned you two heroes here to destroy you."
Strike says: "And just like all the others, I will annihilate you!"
Strike says: "Fine, I'll just summon some other hero to obliterate."
Strike says: "Let's see..."
Strike says: "Ah, this one looks like he's got some fight in him."
Strike says: "Let's play!"
Pen says: "Now summoning hero."
K.O.
Oof!
Pen says: "Success."
K.O.
Hey, what's this spooky dump? And where are my friends?
Strike says: "I am Strike."
Strike says: "Howdy, hero -- and toodle-oo!"
K.O.
What, me?! I-I'm still just a hero in training.
Strike says: "Yeah, I don't care."
K.O.
Whimpers.
K.O.
Huh? Wha-- Who?
Garnet says: "No time for introductions."
Ben Tennyson says: "Guys this way, c'mon!"
Strike says: "If these heroes don't want to stay and play, I'll just have to pin them down."
Garnet says: "There!"
K.O.
You two seem like heroes, but I can't find either of you in my Pow Cards.
Garnet says: "I'm a Crystal Gem."
Garnet says: "I fight off threats from outer space and protect my planet from anything that would harm it."
Garnet says: "The name's Garnet."
K.O.
That's amazing! Uh, what do you do, little boy?
Ben Tennyson says: "Uh, I'm Ten."
K.O.
Oh! I'm sorry.
Ben Tennyson says: "No, I'm Ben Ten..."
Ben Tennyson says: "..."
Ben Tennyson says: "nyson."
Ben Tennyson says: "I travel around the country with my grandpa and cousin Gwen in an RV."
K.O.
That's nice.
Pen says: "Destroy heroes."
Ben Tennyson says: "Let's go Four Arms."
Ben Tennyson says: "It's Hero Time."
Ben Tennyson pressing the Omnitrix and turning into Four Arms.
Four Arms says: "Oh, yeah!"
K.O.
Whoa!
Four Arms says: "Did I fail to mention my Omnitrix, which lets me turn into 10 different super-cool aliens?"
K.O.
Who-ha-ha!
Four Arms says: "My Omnitrix!"
Four Arms says: "I'm stuck like this without it!"
Garnet says: "Stop gawping, or it'll do worse."
K.O.
Shouts.
Garnet says: "Ha!"
Garnet says: "Ha!"
Garnet says: "Take this!"
Pen says: "Spin attack."
Four Arms says: "That don't look good."
K.O.
Strains Thanks, Ben. Or should I call you Four Arms? It's kind of confusing.
Four Arms says: "Don't sweat it."
K.O.
Whimpers.
Garnet says: "Huh?"
K.O.
Garnet! Your cool glasses!
Garnet says: "We'd better get movin'."
Garnet says: "We'e got to lose it before it recovers and steals any more of our powers."
K.O.
Your sunglasses were your power?
Garnet says: "Not quite -- they just gave me the clarity and focus I need to use my future vision -- also, they're prescription."
Four Arms says: "In there!"
Four Arms says: "New, new, new, new!"
Four Arms says: "All clear, guys!"
K.O.
Four Arms!
Four Arms says: "It's hideous!"
K.O.
Huh? Who are all these guys?
Garnet says: "They must be heroes that couldn't escape Strike's..."
Garnet says: "strike."
Garnet says: "Let's keep moving."
Four Arms says: "Man, if red Strike X'ed all these years, h-he be may stronger than I thought."
K.O.
If all these heroes couldn't stop him, what could the three of us possibly do?
Raven says: "Do what he isn't expecting, and go to his lair."
K.O.
That's a great idea, Garnet!
Garnet says: "I didn't say anything, K."
Garnet says: "O."
K.O.
Ben?
Four Arms says: "Dude, did that honestly sound like my voice to you?"
Raven says: "I said."
K.O.
Gasps A hero!
Raven says: "Hi."
K.O.
Strains You've got X'ed by Strike, but you can still talk and stuff?
Raven says: "I got protection spell off just before he X'ed me."
Raven says: "Thanks..."
Raven says: "you?"
Garnet says: "Garnet."
K.O.
K.O.!
Garnet says: "We need to know who you are and what this place is."
Raven says: "I'm part of a group of superheroes called the Teen Titans."
Raven says: "My name's Raven."
Raven says: "Uh, excuse me?"
Raven says: "That's better."
Raven says: "Before I got X'ed out, I learned this used to be a great city of heroes, but Strike appeared and stole everyone's powers."
Raven says: "He was still hungry, so he started summoning heroes from other dimensions to destroy."
Raven says: "If we don't stop him, there'll be no heroes left..."
Raven says: "anywhere."
K.O.
Why would he do something so cob-darn awful?
Raven says: "Eh, it's his thing."
Raven says: "It's what he does."
Raven says: "He's like evil, you know pure evil or whatever."
Four Arms says: "Seems like this dude always has the element of surprise."
Garnet says: "Maybe we should surprise him, and ambush him at his lair."
Raven says: "That was literally the first thing I said."
K.O.
Raven, want to join us?
Raven says: "Eh, I don't know."
Raven says: "I was having such a great time as a lifeless statue."
K.O.
Ooh, a new friend! You can be the brains of our team.
Raven says: "as usual."
K.O.
Hey, Raven? Where is this evil lair anyway?
Raven says: "Over there -- the giant fortress just past the impassable chasm."
K.O.
Oh, okay. Neat.
Raven says: "Still smarter than Beast Boy."
K.O.
So, what kind of magic can you do?
Raven says: "Uh, all of it?"
Raven says: "Normally I would wield my dimensional magic to get us home, but Strike stole my powers."
Raven says: "I can still levitate but -- Azarath Metrion Zinthos!"
Raven says: "Nothing."
K.O.
Whippley dip dipple. I just realized that we all come from teams of great heroes. Maybe the four of us can form a new team together. How about "O.K. Ben! Let's Go! Universe"?
Four Arms says: "Yeah, this is a pretty good time."
K.O.
Sighs.
Four Arms says: "K."
Four Arms says: "O."
Four Arms says: ", watch out!"
K.O.
Gasps.
Raven says: "Strike's traps."
K.O.
W-- How are we supposed to get across that?!
Raven says: "You guys all have flight powers, right?"
Four Arms says: "You know, one of my other forms can fly, actually."
Raven says: "Really?!"
Raven says: "!"
Raven says: "That's so cool!"
Raven says: "And would be really useful in this situation."
Four Arms says: "It's not my fault I don't have my Omnitrix, okay?"
Garnet says: "You double need to stop bickering and pay attention."
Four Arms says: "Ahh!"
Four Arms says: "Chompy fish!"
Raven says: "Everyone, hold on to my super-strong legs!"
K.O. says: "..."
Garnet says: "..."
K.O. says: "back!"
Garnet says: "back!"
K.O.
Ha! Power fist!
Raven says: "We're almost there!"
Raven says: "Hold on tight!"
Raven says: "Agh!"
Raven says: "Never mind."
Raven says: "We're gonna die."
Garnet says: "Leave it to me."
Garnet says: "Hup!"
Garnet says: "No one hurts my friends."
Garnet says: "Rrrraw!"
K.O.
Wow! Thanks, Garnet.
Four Arms says: "Yeah, thanks, Garnet."
Raven says: "This is it -- Strike's lair."
Raven says: "Got to admit, he's got taste."
Four Arms says: "What do we do now?"
K.O.
Whoa! Shouts.
Garnet says: "Run!"
Pen says: "Destroy Heroes."
K.O.
Ah!
Four Arms says: "What is it waiting for?"
Strike says: "Me."
Four Arms says: "What?!"
Four Arms says: "!"
Strike says: "I programmed ole blasty here to corner you -- not to destroy you."
Four Arms says: "Oh."
Four Arms says: "Phew!"
Strike says: "I'm gonna do that myself."
All says: "Uh-oh."
Strike says: "And now to start my incredibly long, un-interruptible power-up sequence."
Garnet says: "He's channeling dark magics for a single, fatal blow."
Four Arms says: "We got to do something!"
Raven says: "Without our powers?"
Raven says: "Face it, he's got us pinned."
K.O.
Pen... Pen... Pen! That's it! Power fist! Ha. Ta-da!
Raven says: "What?"
K.O.
Well, I noticed all those piranha traps back there were red. So I figured this thing can create as well as destroy. Besides, it does look kind of like a big ole pen.
Raven says: "That's an astonishing logical leap K."
Raven says: "O."
K.O.
Groans Aaaand... Whoops, can't forget this.
Four Arms says: "I'm too young to di-- My Omnitrix!"

Garnet says: "Well, that's our powers restored, but what about yours K."
Garnet says: "O."
Garnet says: "?"
K.O.
Chuckles Oh, well, I never actually lost my powers. The only thing I've been missing is my friends. But I just realized -- I have friends right here! And as long as we're together, nothing can stop us!
Ben Tennyson says: "Good pep talk, bro!"
Garnet says: "Okay, K."
Garnet says: "O."
Garnet says: ", let's be heroes."
Strike says: "-..."
