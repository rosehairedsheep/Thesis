Open Ext. Fish Stew Pizza, Daytime.
Steven puts up missing posters for Lion on the pizzeria's windows from inside. As he leaves, he speaks to someone inside.
Steven says: "If you see him, call me right away."
Steven says: "He's my only interdimensional gateway to space, and I love him."
Just then, a yellow sports car stops in front of Steven, causing the fliers to fly out of his hands.
Steven says: "Aah!"
Steven says: "Aah!"
The car door opens and Kevin steps out, flicking his hair.
Kevin says: "What are you doing Saturday night?"
Steven stares at Kevin, unamused, and starts to walk away to pick up his flyers. Kevin runs after him in shock.
Kevin says: "Hey!"
Kevin says: "Listen!"
Kevin says: "Little kid!"
Steven says: "Beat it, Kevin."
Kevin says: "I'm throwing a party at my parents' palatial estate."
Kevin says: "All the coolest teens in Delmarva have RSVP'd, except one; the only one cooler than I am."
Steven says: "Are you..."
Steven says: "talking about me?"
Kevin says: "What?"
Kevin says: "No!"
Kevin says: "Eww!"
Kevin says: "I'm talking about Stevonnie."
Steven says: "W-W-What?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "You can't just- *grumbles* This is the last thing I need right now."
Kevin says: "Look, Stevonnie is better than me, okay?"
Kevin says: "Better dancer, better driver."
Kevin says: "Stevonnie truly does not care what anyone thinks."
Kevin says: "That's why they're the coolest."
Kevin says: "If I can't be the coolest, I at least got to be seen hanging with the coolest."
Steven says: "Stevonnie only exists when Connie and I are together, and we're..."
Steven says: "I'm not coming."
Kevin says: "*sighs* Great."
Kevin says: "So I invited that other kid for nothing."
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "Wh- Connie's going?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven drops all of his fliers and runs after Kevin, panting.
Kevin says: "Of course she's going."
Kevin says: "No one turns down an invitation to a Kevin party."
Steven says: "But she can't stand you."
Steven says: "Why would she- *gasps* Wait!"
Steven says: "Did you say all of this to her, too?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "Does she think I'm- *trips and falls, grunting* -I'm gonna be there?"
Kevin gets into his car and starts the engine, as Steven frantically tries to talk to him.
Steven says: "Is it too late to RSVP?"
Kevin rolls down his window.
Kevin says: "Yes."
Kevin says: "But!"
Kevin says: "I'll make an exception..."
Kevin says: "for Stevonnie."
Kevin drives away, but immediately returns.
Kevin says: "Wait."
Kevin says: "What's your number?"
Kevin says: "I'll text you the address."
Steven says: "Oh."
Steven says: "Yeah, uhh, 301-555..."
Kevin says: "*rolls his eyes* Here, you enter it."
Steven says: "Okay, uh, how do I..."
Steven says: "?"
Kevin says: "You roll the little ball to navigate."
Steven says: "The screen is so tiny."
Steven says: "*enters his contact details* Here."
Kevin says: "Huh, your name's Steven?"
Kevin says: "Weird."
Kevin says: "I thought it was Clarence."
Kevin says: "See you at the party Saturday, Steven."
Kevin turns his car around and drives away, leaving Steven behind.
Trans. Kevin's Estate, Night-time.
Steven arrives in the backyard of Kevin's estate, and mid-tempo music and lots of chattering are heard. As Steven nervously walks in, he draws the attention of several party-goers.
Kevin says: "Steven!"
Kevin says: "What took you so long?!"
Kevin says: "!"
Steven says: "I-I got lost coming up the driveway."
Derrick says: "Yo, Kev, who invited the 7-year-old, bro?"
Kevin says: "Hey, shut your mouth, Derrick!"
Kevin says: "I thought I told you to go buy more ice!"
Kevin says: "*looks at Steven and cringes* Ugh."
Kevin says: "You just come from picture day at school or something?"
Steven says: "I brought snacks?"
Kevin grabs Steven's snacks and throws them away.
Steven says: "Wha..."
Steven says: "?"
Steven says: "Aah!"
Kevin says: "This party is lame enough as it is."
Kevin says: "Look at these people!"
The party-goers who were staring at Steven earlier quickly return to their previous activities.
Kevin says: "This is forgettable!"
Kevin says: "But not for long."
Kevin says: "Every time Stevonnie shows up on the scene, everybody's talking about it."
Kevin says: "And when Stevonnie shows up at my party, everyone's gonna be talking about this night until they're old grandparents."
Kevin says: "And their last words to their grandchildren will be, "Kevin throws the best parties."
Steven chuckles nervously, when he notices Lion standing with some of the party-goers some distance away.
Steven says: "Um..."
Steven says: "Lion?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "*turns to Kevin* Wait, you're the one who had him the whole time?!"
Steven says: "!"
Kevin says: "What?"
Kevin says: "Ugh!"
Kevin says: "No, I'm allergic to dogs."
Steven says: "Then what's he doing here?"
Lion moves away, and Steven gasps as he sees Connie standing besides Lion. Both Connie's and Steven's eyes meet, and Steven hides behind Kevin in hesitation.
Steven says: "Connie!"
Kevin says: "Hey!"
Steven says: "I haven't seen her in so long."
Steven says: "She looks so different."
Steven says: "Ugh!"
Steven says: "*crotches down* I thought she'd be here to see me, but maybe she's just here to have a good time."
Steven says: "Maybe she's moved on."
Kevin says: "She's moved on?"
Kevin says: "Wait, did you guys break up?"
Kevin says: "Can 7-year-olds even do that?"
Steven says: "I'm 14."
Kevin says: "You didn't tell me you guys broke up."
Kevin says: "You got a free ticket to what would have been the best teen party in Delmarva."
Kevin says: "But now it's just some sad kid party getting crashed by a couple of sad kids!"
Steven says: "All right, okay."
Steven says: "I'm- I'm leaving."
Kevin says: "*inhales* No."
Kevin says: "When did this happen?"
Steven says: "A few weeks ago."
Kevin says: "Hmm..."
Kevin says: "You been texting her?"
Steven says: "Several dozen times."
Kevin says: "*sighs* She text you back?"
Steven says: "Umm..."
Steven says: "No..."
Steven says: "?"
Kevin says: "Hmm..."
Kevin says: "But she knew you'd be here."
Steven says: "Right!"
Steven says: "Right."
Steven says: "I'll- I'll just go talk to her."
Steven says: "*blushes and tears up* I'll- I'll just go tell her how sorry I am."
Steven says: "I-I really messed up."
Steven says: "*sniffles* I-I was an idiot!"
Steven begins walking toward Connie, but Kevin grabs him and pulls him away.
Kevin says: "Whoa!"
Kevin says: "No no no no no no no no no."
Kevin says: "Okay, kid, listen."
Kevin says: "I wouldn't normally do this, because you're a pitiful kid with snot coming out of your nose..."
Steven sobs and sniffles.
Kevin says: "..."
Kevin says: "But I need those old people to whisper my name when they die."
Kevin says: "And if you don't pull it together, you're gonna regret it."
Kevin says: "And it'll be Sabina all over again!"
Steven says: "Wh-Who's- *sniffles* Who's Sabina?"
Kevin's face turns red in embarrassment and frustration, but he immediately composes himself.
Kevin says: "You can't just dump your emotional honesty face all over her."
Kevin says: "You're gonna freak her out!"
Steven says: "*sniffles* I-I just want us to talk again."
Kevin says: "Exactly."
Kevin says: "But look what she's doing."
Kevin says: "Life is good."
Kevin says: "She's got a dog now."
Steven says: "*sighs* And a haircut."
Kevin says: "Right."
Kevin says: "But your life is good, too."
Kevin says: "You don't need to talk to her either."
Kevin says: "You've got new stuff going on: new friends, new shirt."
Steven says: "She gave this to me for my birthday."
Kevin says: "*unimpressed* Ughh..."
Kevin says: "Derrick!"
Kevin says: "Gimme your jacket."
Kevin walks over to Derrick.
Derrick says: "What?"
Derrick says: "No."
Derrick says: "Dude!"
Derrick says: "Aah!"
Kevin says: "Derrick!"
Derrick says: "Come on!"
Kevin wrestles with Derrick off-screen and returns to Steven with Derrick's jacket.
Kevin says: "Here."
Kevin says: "Put this on."
Steven says: "Your friend looks kind of mad, though."
Kevin says: "He's not my friend..."
Kevin says: "?"
Kevin says: "Put it on."
Kevin says: "Collar up."
Steven takes the jacket and puts it on.
Kevin says: "Hmm..."
Kevin says: "Not quite cool enough."
Kevin says: "I got it."
Kevin takes off his scarf and puts it on Steven.
Kevin says: "Nice~ It's almost like you have style."
Steven says: "Why do I need the scarf?"
Steven says: "It's not even cold out."
Kevin says: "When you put on a scarf like this, it's always cool."
Kevin says: "Let's show her what a great time you're having."
Kevin and Steven begin to hang out together by drinking beverages, conversing with the other party-goers, and dancing. Throughout the part, Connie notices Steven hanging out with Kevin and becomes increasingly agitated. Late into the party, Steven and Kevin lounge on the steps of the patio, when Kevin notices Connie glancing over at them, who quickly turns away.
Kevin says: "*smirks* Hey, kid, you should say hi to Connie."
Steven says: "So I can tell her about my feelings?"
Kevin says: "No."
Kevin says: "Be casual."
Kevin says: "You're showing her how you have it together."
Kevin says: "You're not dying to talk to her because you're not dying at all."
Kevin says: "You're living."
Kevin says: "Make her want that life with you."
Steven says: "Kevin, that- that's kind of moving."
Kevin says: "So move already."
Kevin says: "Walk over, be cool, and walk away."
Steven says: "Got it!"
Steven beings walking toward Connie. He turns around partway and waves at Kevin, who stares back nonchalantly, before continuing toward Connie.
Steven says: "*to himself* Okay."
Steven says: "Be cool."
Steven says: "Be cool, yeah."
Steven says: "Be cool."
Steven says: "*reaches Connie* Hey!"
Connie says: "Hi."
Steven says: "*coughs* Nice weather you're wearing."
Connie says: "Uhh..."
Connie says: "I got your texts."
Steven says: "Oh, yeah."
Steven says: "I forgot about those, because I've been living."
Connie says: "Wha..."
Connie says: "?"
Steven says: "Welp, back to my great life."
Steven says: "Uh, chowzers."
Steven turns away nervously and runs back to Kevin.
Steven says: "*whimpering* That was terrible!"
Steven says: "This is all wrong, Kevin!"
Kevin says: "No way."
Kevin says: "Look, little man."
Kevin says: "Your girl's making her way back for more."
Connie runs up to Steven.
Connie says: "Steven!"
Connie says: "What is going on?!"
Connie says: "!"
Connie says: "I came here hoping we could talk, but it seems like you only want to talk to Kevin!"
Connie says: "I guess Kevin is your best friend now!"
Steven says: "What?"
Kevin says: "What?"
Steven says: "No, no, no!"
Kevin says: "No, no, no!"
Connie says: "*sighs, flustered* Anyway, I'm glad you're doing well."
Connie says: "That's..."
Connie says: "all I really wanted to know."
Steven says: "No, no!"
Steven says: "But-But you're my best friend!"
Kevin says: "Best friend?!"
Kevin says: "!"
Kevin says: "What are you kids even talking about?"
Kevin says: "I thought she was your ex."
Kevin says: "Great."
Kevin says: "Now what am I gonna do?"
Kevin says: "Think, Kevin."
Kevin says: "How do people treat their friends?"
Kevin begins stressing himself, and Steven runs after Connie, who is about to get onto Lion's back.
Steven says: "Connie!"
Steven says: "Wait, wait, Connie."
Steven says: "Don't go."
Connie says: "Steven, I wasn't trying to ignore you."
Connie says: "I was going to text you back."
Connie says: "I-I wrote, "I can't talk to you right now."
Connie says: "" But then I realized if I sent it, that would be talking to you."
Connie says: "And it didn't make any sense- I wasn't making any sense."
Connie says: "If we were going to talk, I thought it's got to be in person."
Connie says: "So I rode Lion to your house, but there was a note that said, "Gone vacationing", and then I ran into Kevin and he said you'd be here, but, uhh, maybe this is still too soon."
Connie says: "I-I don't even know what to say to you."
Connie says: "I'm..."
Connie says: "angry?"
Connie says: "I miss you?"
Connie says: "I feel like I'm out of my mind."
Steven says: "No, you're not."
Steven says: "I surrendered myself to Homeworld."
Steven says: "I let them take me away, maybe forever, and then I came back and I tried to act like it was no big deal."
Steven says: "But it was a big deal."
Steven says: "I couldn't stand the thought of you being taken away on that spaceship, but..."
Steven says: "Then I did that to you."
Steven says: "I promised you we'd always be a team, and..."
Steven says: "I let you down."
Steven says: "I'm sorry."
Steven says: "Jam buds?"
Connie says: "Jam buds."
Steven and Connie tear up and hug each other.
Connie says: "It's so good to talk to you."
Connie says: "I've been wanting to see you so bad I accepted a party invitation from Kevin."
Steven says: "*chuckles* I know."
Steven says: "I took his advice."
Steven says: "*chuckles* I think he got his heart broken, i-it's actually really sad."
Connie says: "*chuckles* Of course he did."
Connie says: "*chuckles* Hey, nice shirt."
Steven says: "Nice hair."
Connie says: "*giggles* Thank you."
Kevin says: "All right!"
After observing Steven and Connie reconciling with each other, Kevin eagerly grabs a microphone and speaks into it.
Kevin says: "Hey, everybody, are you having fun?"
Party-Goers says: "Yeah!"
Kevin says: "Liars!"
Kevin says: "You're all so fake."
Kevin says: "You make me sick."
Kevin says: "But get ready."
Kevin says: "I'm gonna introduce you to somebody so real you'll all feel as sick as me!"
Kevin says: "This party starts now!"
Kevin says: "Children!"
Kevin says: "Go!"
Loud music begins to play to cue the special appearance, but Steven and Connie climb onto Lion instead.
Connie says: "It's pretty late."
Connie says: "We should head out."
Steven says: "Thanks for all your help, Kevin."
Kevin says: "Wha?"
Kevin says: "*drops the microphone in shock* You got to do the thing!"
Kevin says: "What did I help you for if you're not gonna elevate my party?"
Lion begins walking away.
Kevin says: "Wha..."
Kevin says: "?!"
Kevin says: "!"
Kevin says: "Hey!"
Kevin says: "Shut up, Derrick!"
Connie says: "If it helps, Kevin, I think you threw a very nice party."
Steven says: "Mm-hmm."
Steven says: "Good night!"
Lion roars open a magical portal and jumps through it.
Kevin says: "No!"
Kevin says: "Wait!"
The party-goers cheer and clap as Lion disappears through the portal. The star iris then closes in on Kevin, groaning in misery and frustration.
END.
