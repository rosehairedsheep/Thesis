Open Ext. Crystal Temple.
Steven is lying on the couch in the living room of the Beach House, talking on his phone with Connie.
Steven says: "What..."
Steven says: "?"
Steven says: "Why not?"
Trans. Int. Connie's house.
Connie says: "Steven, I told you, I can't hang out today."
Connie says: "I have tennis practice."
Connie says: "And then Mom wants to go out for a family dinner."
Connie says: "But she said I could hang out all day tomorrow, and I can come over all the time now that it's summer vacation."
Steven says: "*flops off the couch* What's summer vacation?"
Connie says: "You know, when school gets out for the summer?"
Steven says: "I've never been to this..."
Steven says: "How do you say—"
Steven says: ""school"."
Steven says: "How does it work?"
Connie says: "It's a place where you go to learn."
Connie says: "It's full of desks, chalkboards..."
Steven says: "Hmm."
Connie says: "Books, maps."
Steven says: "I see."
Shortly after, Steven begins to assemble a pile of school equipment in the kitchen, with the help of Pearl.
Steven says: "*examines the pile* Yep, it's all coming together."
Pearl says: "*adds a desk to the pile* So, how do we begin our "school"?"
Steven says: "Ugh..."
Steven says: "I..."
Steven says: "I don't know!"
Steven says: "This is everything Connie told me."
Steven says: "Why do I never ask follow-up questions?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "Who will teach little Stevie now!"
Steven says: "?"
Pearl says: "*gasps* Teach you?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Pearl says: "Steven!"
Pearl says: "If only I had known that's what you really wanted!"
Pearl says: "*gets up* Twooooh!"
Pearl says: "*begins doing the same dance as in "Lars and the Cool Kids"* Haaaaaah!"
Pearl's gem begins to glow, as she summons a mirror from her gem. She begins to explain as the mirror twirls in mid-air.
Pearl says: "We found this Gem-powered mirror at the Galaxy Warp."
Pearl says: "It can capture and display any event it's witnessed in all of Gem history."
Pearl says: "It'll offer you everything you've ever wanted to know about your fellow Gems and our culture."
Steven says: "*looks at his reflection in the mirror* I must be incredibly important to Gem culture."
Pearl says: "*scoffs* It's just you in there."
Pearl says: "It hasn't even been activated."
Pearl says: "*clears her throat* Show us the Galaxy Warp."
Pearl says: "Show."
Pearl says: "Us."
Pearl says: "The Galaxy Warp."
Pearl says: "*frustrated* Oh, come on!"
Steven says: "*still holding onto the mirror and gets lifted along* Whoa!"
Pearl says: "I know you've seen it."
Pearl says: "*examines the mirror and sighs* It is in pretty rough shape."
Pearl says: "It must finally be broken."
Pearl says: "What a shame."
Steven says: "*admires himself in the mirror* Doesn't seem broken to me!"
Pearl says: "Oh well."
Pearl says: "I guess that's the end of our school."
Steven says: "*gets excited* Whoa."
Steven says: "Wha..."
Steven says: "So you could say..."
Steven says: "School's out for summer?"
Pearl says: "Yes."
Pearl says: "Good, Steven."
Pearl says: "There are many ways to say the same thing."
Steven says: "*gasps* School's out!"
Pearl says: "*looking at the pile* Hmm."
Pearl says: "The asymmetry of this pile is really starting to bother me."
Trans. Ext. Beach House.
Steven says: "*running down the beach* School's out!"
Steven says: "Happy summer vacation, Steven!"
Steven says: "*starts running backwards* Happy summer vacation, Beach City!"
Steven says: "*chuckles* Yeah!"
Not looking where he is going, Steven bumps into Lars and Sadie, who are setting up tables outside the Big Donut.
Lars says: "Hey!"
Sadie says: "Hey!"
Lars says: "Ugh, watch where you're going, you little f..."
Lars says: "*glances at Sadie* Ssssteven!"
Steven says: "Sorry!"
Steven says: "I'm just so excited for summer."
Steven says: "Are you excited for summer?"
Steven says: "I'm so excited for summer!"
Sadie says: "*laughs* Uh, I think I'm as excited as I can get about setting up extra seating for the summer rush."
Sadie says: "But Lars has big plans."
Lars says: "You bet I do!"
Lars says: "All those out-of-town summer babes traveling away from home without their boyfriends, if you know what I mean."
Steven says: "*looks cluelessly*..."
Steven says: "Nope."
Lars says: "Maybe I'll get a few numbers."
Lars says: "Maybe I'll even..."
Lars says: "call one."
Sadie says: "Ha!"
Sadie says: "Well, yeah, maybe I'll meet a new friend."
Steven says: "That's a great idea!"
Steven says: "A special new friend to have fun on the beach with in the summer."
Steven says: "Maybe if I keep using the mirror to guide me, I'll walk backwards into my own beach-summer-fun buddy!"
Lars says: "Next time you see me, I'll be on the arm of a hot woman!"
Sadie says: "You can stop talking about it now."
Steven says: "*running backwards and laughing, and then begin imitating Michael Jackson and moonwalking* ♪ Wo, Wo, Wo, Wo!"
Steven says: "♪ Wo, Wo, Wo, Wo!"
Steven says: "♪ Wo, Wo, Hee-Hee!"
Steven moonwalks into the boardwalk, when Mayor Dewey's Van, reflected by the mirror and chanting "May-or Dew-ey", is driving towards him.
Mirror says: "*as Lars* Er, watch where you're going, you little!"
Steven says: "Huh?"
Steven says: "*sees the mirror, and then the van* Nooo!"
Steven screams in fear and the van halts just in front of him.
Mayor Dewey says: "*leans out of the van and speaks into a megaphone* Car wash kid, what are you doing?!"
Mayor Dewey says: "!"
Steven says: "I don't know."
Steven says: "Why were you driving down the boardwalk?"
Mayor Dewey says: "I'm the mayor, I'm not going to walk anywhere."
Mayor Dewey says: "Now, go get run over somewhere else."
Mayor Dewey says: "I'm late for a speech."
The van maneuvers around Steven and begins to drive off again.
Steven says: "*looks at the mirror* What just happened?"
Steven says: "You work!"
Steven says: "This is so cool!"
Steven says: "What's it like being a mirror?"
Mirror says: "*projects Steven again* You work!"
Steven says: "So you can repeat stuff?"
Mirror says: "Yeah!"
Mayor Dewey says: "*giving a speech on the beach* Hello, Beach City, my friends!"
Mayor Dewey says: "It's great to be here to celebrate the coming season."
Mayor Dewey says: "A warm summer breeze wafts through the air."
Steven says: "*inhales deeply and makes fart noises* PBHT!"
The crowd snickers.
Mayor Dewey says: "We all look forward to the sounds of the summer season..."
Mirror says: "PBHT!"
Mayor Dewey says: "..."
Mayor Dewey says: "the smells of the busy boardwalk..."
Mirror says: "PBHT!"
Mayor Dewey says: "..."
Mayor Dewey says: "the hot, wet ocean wind..."
Mirror says: "PBHT!"
Mayor Dewey says: "..."
Mayor Dewey says: "the time to take that pressure that's built up all year and just let it out."
Mirror says: "PBHT!"
The crowd laughs aloud.
Steven says: "Wow, you picked that up fast."
Time passes by, Steven remians on the beach, still playing with the mirror.
Mirror says: "PBHT!"
Steven says: "*laughs* You got a lot of mileage out of that joke."
Steven says: "You're pretty funny for a mirror."
Mirror says: "You're pretty funny for a mirror."
Steven says: "*chuckles* I'm not a mirror."
Mirror says: "You're pretty funny for a- Ssssteven!"
Steven says: "*gasps* You made something new!"
Steven says: "Say something else!"
Mirror says: "Ssssteven—"
Mirror says: "is—"
Mirror says: "a new friend."
Steven says: "*blushing* Really?"
Mirror says: "Yeah!"
Steven says: "You're my friend, too!"
Steven says: "I got to go tell the Gems."
Mirror says: "Nooooo!"
Steven says: "Don't be shy, they'll love you."
Mirror says: "*echoing* Nooooo!"
Steven says: "*chuckles* Don't worry, they're a good audience."
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Steven says: "*enters the house* Guys!"
Steven sees Pearl arranging the pile of school equipment from before into a tower, while Garnet and Amethyst watch on.
Amethyst says: "Yo!"
Amethyst says: "Ste-man!"
Pearl says: "Hello, Steven."
Garnet says: "Howdy."
Garnet says: "*makes a finger gun* Bang."
Amethyst says: "Want to see something hilarious?"
Amethyst takes a M.C. Bear Bear toy and attempts to place it on the tower, which Pearl quickly impales with her spear. Amethyst then starts laughing.
Pearl says: "You don't understand."
Pearl says: "Symmetrical means both sides have to be the same!"
Pearl says: "*grunts angrily and tosses M."
Pearl says: "C."
Steven says: "M."
Steven says: "C."
Steven says: "Bear-Bear!"
Steven says: "Okay, that's great."
Steven says: "Anyway, I fixed the mirror!"
Pearl says: "Excellent work, Steven!"
Steven says: "You didn't tell me it's like a person."
The Gems react in shock.
Pearl says: "Wait."
Pearl says: "What?"
Steven says: "Say "hey."
Steven says: ""..."
Steven says: "Lil' buddy..."
Steven says: "Uh..."
Steven says: "excuse us."
Steven says: "*turns around* Come on."
Steven says: "You want to come out, don't you?"
Steven says: "You have so much to say and funny noises to share from across the ages."
Steven says: "Are we not beach-summer-fun buddies?"
Mirror says: "*whirs* PBHT!"
Steven says: "*laughs* Just couldn't help yourself, huh?"
Mirror says: "*as Steven* Just- for- you!"
Mirror says: "*as Lars* Ssssteven!"
Pearl says: "It's talking to him?"
Pearl says: "It shouldn't be able to do that."
Pearl says: "I-it should just be following orders..."
Amethyst says: "Garnet, do something."
Garnet says: "Steven."
Mirror says: "*keeps laughing, and then Garnet approaches* Nooooo!"
Garnet says: "You should just give us back the mirror."
Garnet says: "It will be safer where we can watch it."
Amethyst says: "Yeah, let's bubble it!"
Mirror says: "Nooooo!"
Mirror says: "*echoes repeatedly* Nooooo!"
Steven says: "Wha..."
Garnet says: "Steven."
Garnet says: "Don't make me have to take it from you."
Steven says: "*gasps* It doesn't want to go with you."
Steven says: "Don't you hear it screaming?"
Garnet says: "Steven, it's just a mirror, a tool."
Garnet says: "It can't want anything."
Mirror says: "*echoing repeatedly* Nooooo!"
Steven says: "*growls* It wants to be with ME!"
Steven slaps Garnet's hand away, which hits her in the face and knocks her visor off. Amethyst gasps in extreme surprise, and Garnet glares at Steven in anger.
Steven says: "Aah!"
Steven says: "Aah!"
Steven says: "*runs out of the house* I'm sorry!"
Steven says: "..."
Garnet says: "*puts her visor back on and clenches her fists* That little boy..."
Garnet says: "is in big trouble."
Pearl says: "Garnet, wait!"
Pearl says: "I'm sure he didn't understand what he was doing!"
Trans. Ext. Beach House.
The Gems exit the house to the beach.
Garnet says: "Fan out."
Steven says: "*runs and hides behind a rock, panting heavily* What am I gonna do?"
Steven says: "What's their problem with you?"
Steven says: "Are you trying to say something?"
Mirror says: "*whirs in distortion* Away from home- Let- Me- Out!"
Steven says: "I don't understand!"
Pearl says: "*calling from afar* Steven!"
Steven says: "Come on!"
Steven says: "I want to help you!"
Steven says: "What can I do?"
Steven turns the mirror to its back and begins tugging on the gem. As he is pulling the gem, water from the sea begins to form the pattern of the mirror around Steven. After much effort, Steven manages to pull the gem out, and the mirror shatters. The gem then starts glowing in Steven's hand and levitates in mid-air. It reforms back into its physical, humanoid form and collapses onto the sand. .
Steven says: "*gasps* Wha..."
Lapis says: "*turns to Steven* Thank you..."
Lapis says: "You didn't—"
Lapis says: "*struggles to stand, but Steven help her up* You actually talked to me."
Lapis says: "You helped me!"
Lapis says: "It's Steven, right?"
Steven says: "*breathes deeply* Mm."
Lapis says: "I'm Lapis -- Lapis Lazuli."
Lapis says: "Are you really a Crystal Gem?"
Steven says: "Yeah!"
Lapis says: "But you set me free."
Steven says: "But—"
Steven says: "Wha..."
Garnet says: "STEVEN!!!!!"
The Gems approach and summon their weapons.
Steven says: "*runs towards the Gems* Wait!"
Lapis says: "You..."
Lapis says: "*raises a huge water-arm out of the ocean* You three knew I was in there, and you didn't do anything."
Lapis says: "Did you even wonder who I USED TO BE!!"
Lapis slams the water-arm onto the Gems, trapping Garnet underneath it and knocking Pearl and Amethyst aside.
Pearl says: "Steven, run!"
Steven says: "What are you doing?"
Lapis says: "I'm Lapis Lazuli, and you can't keep me trapped here anymore!"
Steven says: "Huh?"
Lapis says: "They're not going to let us leave."
Steven says: "Leave?"
Lapis says: "*parts the ocean in half, creating a path through it* Steven, come with me."
Steven says: "Where?"
Lapis says: "Home."
Steven says: "B-b-but..."
Steven says: "B-but I..."
Steven says: "Uh..."
Lapis says: "Fine."
Garnet manages to break free of the water-arm and punches it away. She then charges towards Steven and Lapis.
Lapis says: "Don't trust them, Steven."
Lapis says: "Goodbye."
Lapis walks into the ocean, and create a huge wave that knocks Steven and Garnet back away. Pearl and Amethyst rush to their side.
Pearl says: "Steven!"
Pearl says: "*embraces Steven* Are you okay?"
Steven says: "Yeah."
Steven says: "I'm fine."
Steven says: "So, that was another Gem?"
Pearl says: "*sighs* Yes."
The Crystal Gems gaze out to the ocean for the brief moment.
Garnet says: "Steven, you're grounded."
The star iris then zooms in on a distant star, ending the episode.
END.
