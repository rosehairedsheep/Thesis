Open Int. Crystal Temple.
The Crystal Gems warp back onto the Crystal Temple Warp Pad. Pearl is scolding Amethyst for her recklessness.
Pearl says: "How could you POSSIBLY think punching a blood polyp was a good idea?"
Pearl says: "Look at all the gunk you got on me!"
Pearl says: "*flicks away a small piece of gunk on her arm* And look at Steven!"
Steven says: "*is covered in thick gunk except for his face* It's not so bad once you get used to it."
Amethyst says: "See?"
Amethyst says: "He likes it."
Pearl says: "He certainly won't like it when it hardens."
Steven says: "*starts to worry* Uhh, what?"
Steven says: "Umm, I'm gonna go wash."
Pearl says: "*off-screen* He shouldn't have been so close in the first place."
Steven waddles towards the fridge, when the gunk hardens him in place.
Amethyst says: "How was I supposed to know they pop?"
Steven says: "Uh, guys?"
Pearl says: "You're always PUTTING us in danger with your little outbursts!"
Pearl says: "Ugh, you are just..."
Pearl says: "SO..."
Pearl says: "CHILDISH!"
Amethyst says: "Yeah, yeah."
Amethyst says: "And don't forget "reckless", "vulgar", "loud mouth"."
Amethyst says: "And that's just what makes me so AWESOME!"
Amethyst says: "*yells* RIGHT, GARNET?!"
Amethyst says: "!"
Amethyst says: "?"
Garnet says: "*shifts her visor* Amethyst, you are a Crystal Gem."
Garnet says: "You need to act like it."
Amethyst says: "*turns around* Fine."
Pearl says: "smiles* I think we really got through to her!"
Steven says: "*still trapped* Guys?"
Time Skip-nighttime.
Steven is fast asleep in the hardened shell of the gunk. The Temple Gate opens, waking Steven up. Amethyst rushes out of the door wearing a cape and leaves the house. Steven falls over and the mold shatters, freeing him.
Steven says: "Amethyst?"
Steven follows Amethyst, shapeshifting as she runs, to a warehouse.
Trans. Int. Abandoned Warehouse.
Steven peeks through a window of the warehouse. Mr. Smiley is seen emceeing a wrestling tournament, while Amethyst reveals herself as a wrestler in the center of the ring.
Mr. Smiley says: "For those of you befuddled by the events of athleticism, you are about to see the Purple Puma, rrraah, is the single most hated wrestler in Beach City Underground's..."
Mr. Smiley says: "HIS-TO-RYYY!"
Steven says: "*whispering* What!"
Steven says: "?"
Mr. Smiley says: "Alright ladies and gentlemen, let's introduce his opponent, or should I say victim, hahaha, the Loch Ness Bloggster!"
Ronaldo says: "*dressed as the Loch Ness Bloggster* I'm..."
Ronaldo says: "uuhhhh-haa..."
Ronaldo says: "going to end your reign of terror!"
Ronaldo says: "GAAH!!!"
Mr. Smiley says: "*laughs* Well, now, now that was quick."
Trans. Ext. Abandoned Warehouse.
Purple Puma bursts through the warehouse back doors, roars in victory and shapeshifts back to Amethyst. She sighs, when Steven suddenly grapples her from behind.
Steven says: "AMETHYST!"
Amethyst, startled, flips Steven onto his back.
Amethyst says: "*shocked* What are YOU doing here?"
Steven says: "*starry-eyes* Are you a secret wrestler?"
Amethyst says: "..."
Amethyst says: "Yyyeah."
Steven says: "*gasps excitedly and gets up* But HOW?"
Steven says: "But WHEN?"
Steven says: "But WHY?"
Amethyst says: "..."
Amethyst says: "Come here."
Amethyst says: "Let me explain something to you."
Amethyst says: "In the ring, NOBODY can tell me what to do!"
Amethyst says: "And if they try, I HIT 'EM IN THE FACE WITH A CHAIR!"
Steven says: "And people..."
Steven says: "like that?"
Amethyst says: ""Like it"?"
Amethyst says: "They LOVE it!"
Amethyst says: "AHA.."
Amethyst says: "Well, they hate it, but it's all part of the fun, you know?"
Amethyst says: "E-everyone here..."
Amethyst says: "gets that."
Amethyst says: "URGGGHHHH!"
Amethyst says: "You don't know what it's like having Pearl and Garnet on your back all the time!"
Steven says: "Are you KIDDING me?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "*impersonates Pearl* "Oh, Steven, I told you before not to take peanut butter on missions."
Steven says: "" *impersonates Garnet* "I'm not going to say anything, but I expect you to understand that was wrong."
Steven says: ""  Let me be a wrestler with you!"
Steven says: "I'm SO stifled!"
Amethyst says: "*thinks for a moment* Well, I haven't won the tag team belt yet."
Amethyst says: "But you can't tell Pearl and Garnet."
Steven says: "Deal!"
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Steven grabs various props inside his house, such as a collared shirt, a tie, suspenders, and a small tiger mask. He puts on the props and slicks back his hair with Margarine. Amethyst is napping on the couch when Steven bursts in and wakes her up.
Steven says: "Are you READY?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "Presenting Tiger Millionaire!"
Amethyst says: "*interrupts* Wow, you just came up with all that?"
Steven says: "Well, yeah."
Steven says: "What's your backstory?"
Amethyst says: "Pumas are COOL."
Steven says: "Uhh..."
Steven says: "We'll workshop that later."
Trans. Int. Abandoned Warehouse.
Mr. Smiley says: "Two local heroes in the ring tonight, they build hospitals for the sick, and they build muscles that look slick!"
Mr. Smiley says: "Give it up for..."
Mr. Smiley says: "."
Mr. Smiley says: "Concrete Heat and Chunk Truck!"
Mr. Smiley says: "Facing off against the Purple Puma and our newest, MEWEST competitor, Tiiigeeerrr Millionaire!!!"
Lars says: "*in the audience with Sadie* That little guy's gonna get creamed."
Sadie says: "*eating popcorn* From here, he kinda looks like Steven."
Lars says: "Pfft!"
Lars says: "Yeah right!"
Tiger Millionaire tries to step into the ring, when Purple Puma halts him.
Amethyst says: "Steven!"
Amethyst says: "Wait!"
Amethyst says: "I'm just using you to get the tag team belt, I'll do all the actual fighting."
Steven says: "Do I still get to wear the costume?"
Amethyst says: "I don't CARE!"
Steven says: "OK!"
The bell rings, starting the fight. Purple Puma roars and charges at Chunk Trunk, knocking him away. The audience boos while Concrete Heat sneaks up behind Purple Puma.
Mr. Smiley says: "Oh!"
Mr. Smiley says: "Devastating move by Puma!"
Steven says: "Uhhh..."
Steven says: "Purple!"
Steven says: "Purple Puma!"
Steven says: "Look out!"
Concrete Heat shoves a traffic cone onto Purple Puma's head, blinding him. The audience cheers.
Mr. Smiley says: "What a gross usage of safety equipment, and your tax dollars."
Steven says: "That's not fair..."
Steven says: "!"
Mr. Smiley says: "It may not SEEM fair, but hey, anything goes in wrestling."
Steven says: "It DOES?!"
Steven says: "!"
Mr. Smiley says: "OH, YES, IT DOES!"
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "Looks like this Tiger's gotta turn cheetah!"
Steven says: "HEY!"
Steven says: "Chunk Truck!"
Steven says: "I'll give you a million jungle bucks to throw the match!"
Mr. Smiley says: "What's this?"
Mr. Smiley says: "It looks like Tiger Millionaire is offering a bribe!"
Chunk Truck says: "Why, we could fill a thousand potholes with-  A-huh!"
Lars says: "*surprised* Oh SNAP!"
Lars says: "Did you see that?!"
Lars says: "!"
Purple Puma pulls the traffic cone off his head and body-slams onto Chunk Truck.
Mr. Smiley says: "OH!!"
Mr. Smiley says: "I mean just..."
Mr. Smiley says: "wow!"
Amethyst says: "Way to go, Tiger!"
A montage of Purple Puma and Tiger Millionaire winning several more wrestling matches is shown, mostly by playing dirty, all while Pearl and Garnet are slowly finding pieces of Steven's props. In one match, Tiger Millionaire throws his tie into the audience, which Lars catches and cheers in delight, as opposed to the audience booing and throwing trash at Tiger Millionaire.
Mr. Smiley says: "*sweating* Record breaking heat tonight folks!"
Mr. Smiley says: "Could it be?"
Mr. Smiley says: "Tiger Millionaire has bought out our soda stand."
Mr. Smiley says: "Maybe he'll share with his thirsty fans- OHH!"
Mr. Smiley says: "Wow, folks, this is really hard to watch."
Lars says: "*laughing in joy* Classic!"
Lars says: "Tiger!"
Lars says: "Hey Tiger!"
Lars says: "*holds up his soda cup* Would you sign this?"
Lars says: "It'd be so rad!"
Steven says: "You couldn't AFFORD IT!!"
Tiger Millionaire smacks Lars' soda off his hand. Lars looks crushed and blushes in embarrassment. He stomps away and throws Tiger Millionaire's tie on the ground.
Mr. Smiley says: "Whoa..."
Mr. Smiley says: "Never thought I'd live to see the day when a contender turned down his fan."
Steven says: "I thought we were just having fun!"
Mr. Smiley says: "Tiger Millionaire, you're the cruelest creature on the planet!"
The crowd jeers and boos at Tiger Millionaire.
Trans. Int. Steven's house.
Steven, in just his underwear, is looking at his tiger mask, visibly upset and in guilt.
Amethyst says: "Hey, Tiger!"
Amethyst says: "Are ya ready to win our FINAL MATCH?!"
Amethyst says: "!"
Steven says: "Amethyst?"
Steven says: "Am I..."
Steven says: "the cruelest creature on the planet?"
Amethyst says: "*chuckles* Oh, Steven!"
Amethyst says: "Those are just words people use to describe how they feel about you."
Amethyst says: "Listen, Steven, you can't let anyone make you feel like garbage."
Steven says: "Is that how you feel?"
Amethyst says: "I only feel how I wanna feel."
Trans. Int. Abandoned Warehouse.
Mr. Smiley says: "Ladies and gentlemen, fans of wrestling, welcome to the tag team championship!"
Mr. Smiley says: "In the ring tonight..."
Mr. Smiley says: "They stomped their way through the tournament and into out hearts, give it up y'all!"
Mr. Smiley says: "Give it up!"
Mr. Smiley says: "For Dashing Danny Doober and Handsome Hank Hackleschmidt!"
Random Man says: "Don't you dare hurt those men, you monsters!"
Sadie says: "Man, people are really hating on Tiger M!"
Lars says: "He's awful because he hurt me specifically!"
Lars says: "*holding up a sign reading "TIGER IS A JERK!"
Purple Puma steps into the ring, when suddenly, all the lights turn on, and Pearl and Garnet jump in.
Steven says: "Pearl?"
Steven says: "Uh, Garnet?!"
Steven says: "!"
Amethyst says: "*shouts* What are you doing?!"
Amethyst says: "!"
Pearl says: "What are WE doing?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Pearl says: "What is THIS?!!"
Pearl says: "!!"
Steven says: "I thought we could use some promotion."
Mr. Smiley says: "Looks like we have some new opponents!"
Pearl says: "NO you don't!"
Pearl says: "*shoves Mr."
Pearl says: "Smiley and turns to the audience* This match is cancelled!"
Steven says: "What?"
Steven says: "Why?"
Pearl says: "*incredulously* "WHY"?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Pearl says: "I can't believe you've been sneaking off to this..."
Pearl says: "this circus of..."
Pearl says: "violence!"
Pearl says: "*turns to Amethyst* And YOU!"
Pearl says: "Using your Gem powers on humans?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Amethyst says: "It's not ENOUGH that you're on my case all the time, you have to RUIN this for me too?!"
Amethyst says: "!"
Pearl says: "We're not here to fight!"
The audience starts chanting "Fight!".
Garnet says: "Steven."
Garnet says: "Amethyst."
Amethyst says: "WHAT?!"
Amethyst says: "!"
Amethyst says: "?!"
Amethyst says: "!"
Garnet says: "Go back to the temple."
Amethyst says: "I DON'T WANNA!!!"
Everyone gasps.
Garnet says: "Don't do this!"
Garnet summons her gauntlets and is locked in a fist fight with Purple Puma.
Steven says: "Guys!"
Steven says: "Stop!"
The fight shakes the whole ring and a microphone rolls towards Tiger Millionaire. He picks it up and runs towards Garnet and Purple Puma.
Steven says: "*into the microphone* WAIT!"
Steven says: "I want to tell you Purple Puma's backstory."
Steven says: "He was the wildest cat in the jungle, so wild, the other cats couldn't take it."
Steven says: "So she, I mean he, went to look for somewhere he fit in, somewhere with other people who felt misunderstood."
Sadie says: "That really sounds like Steven."
Steven says: "That's why we're all here."
Steven says: "To be wild and free, and body slam each other, and wear cool costumes, and make up nicknames and uh..."
Steven says: "so can't we just have this?"
Steven says: "Can't we just wrestle?"
Garnet walks over and takes the microphone.
Garnet says: "No!"
Everyone gasps.
Garnet says: "Because..."
Garnet says: "we are..."
Garnet says: "the Notorious O-Order of..."
Garnet says: "Wrestling Haters."
Pearl says: "That's right!"
Pearl says: "Um..."
Pearl says: "*takes over the microphone* We wanna stop all wrestling everywhere!"
Pearl says: "Are you going to let us destroy all wrestling?"
Pearl says: "*laughs nervously* Hee-huh?"
Lars says: "You gotta save wrestling!"
Lars says: "Come on!"
Lars says: "*holds up a renewed sign reading "TIGER IS NOT A JERK"* Tiger!"
Lars says: "Puma!"
Lars says: "Tiger!"
Lars says: "Puma!"
The audience starts chanting "Tiger! Puma!".
Steven says: "WE'LL stop you!"
Mr. Smiley says: "What a stunning turn around!"
Mr. Smiley says: "The Jungle Duo are fighting back!"
Amethyst says: "*kneels beside Garnet, who is lying on the floor* Sorry for..."
Amethyst says: "uh..."
Amethyst says: "sorry."
Garnet says: "Same here."
Mr. Smiley says: "Tiger Millionaire has claimed the Tag Team Belts!"
Mr. Smiley says: "Tiger and Puma have WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP!"
Mr. Smiley says: "And saved wrestling!"
Sadie says: "Lars, I'm really confused."
Lars says: "I love you, Tiger Millionaire."
The star iris zooms in on Lars' tear, ending the episode.
