Open. Int. Mysterious Planet.
Steven says: "Okay."
Steven says: "This shouldn't take too long."
Steven says: "Most Gems come around pretty quickly when I invite them to Little Homeschool in person."
Lapis says: "What a gorgeous planet."
Steven and Lapis encounter a mysterious flower bud creature.
Steven says: "Woah."
Steven proceeds to touch it, which makes the bud retreat into a bush with other buds. Steven approaches the buds again and pets one.
Steven says: "It's okay, little guy."
Lapis says: "Wow, Steven."
Lapis says: "It took you a whole five seconds to make a new friend."
Lapis says: "You're getting rusty."
Lapis says: "*approaches* You know, I never used to notice creatures like this."
Lapis says: "Before Earth and you, I used to terraform planets without thinking twice."
Lapis says: "I wonder what I destroyed."
Lapis says: "*bud creature opens* Life like this is so precious."
The bud creatures all open up, but then close as something passes through the air.
Lapis says: "Uh, Steven."
They walk to an edge to see what's going on.
Steven says: "Ah."
Steven says: "So the rumors are true."
Lapis says: "You think they didn't get your message that we're not destroying planets anymore?"
Steven says: "I'm sure they did."
Steven says: "Everyone did."
Steven says: "But, I'll get them to stop."
Lapis says: "This might be harder than you think."
A blue figure flys by.
Steven says: "There they are."
In the distance is "Nice" Lapis and "Mean" Lapis, who are manipulating the water to slice up a large rock. This terrifies the flower bud creatures into hiding.
Steven says: "Hey!"
Steven says: "Stop!"
The Lapides decide to throw a tidal wave at Steven and Lapis, the former guarding against it successfully.
"Nice" Lapis says: "Wait a minute."
"Nice" Lapis says: "That's Steven Universe!"
"Mean" Lapis says: "He's smaller than I thought."
Both float down to the edge.
"Nice" Lapis says: "Well, what do you think?"
"Nice" Lapis says: "We're almost done with this world."
"Mean" Lapis says: "And who's this?"
"Mean" Lapis says: "We don't need the extra help."
"Nice" Lapis says: "You must have heard about our exemplary work."
"Nice" Lapis says: "That's why you're here, I presume."
Steven says: "Yeah."
Steven says: "Well, no."
Steven says: "Look, the empire is over."
"Nice" Lapis says: "We know."
Steven says: "The Diamonds don't control you anymore."
"Mean" Lapis says: "That's right."
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "So, you don't have to terraform planets for them anymore."
Steven says: "You're free to do whatever you like."
"Nice" Lapis says: "Oh, I see."
"Nice" Lapis says: "This is just a misunderstanding."
"Mean" Lapis says: "Terraforming is what we like."
Lapis says: "*sighs* Here we go."
Steven says: "Uh, okay, wait."
Steven says: "You're free to do whatever you like..."
Steven says: "as long as it's not destroying a world."
"Mean" Lapis says: "That's not what you just said a second ago."
"Nice" Lapis says: "Why would we stop?"
Lapis says: "Because it's wrong!"
"Nice" Lapis says: "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
"Nice" Lapis says: "How can the thing we've always done just suddenly be wrong?"
"Nice" Lapis says: "At the very least, we've got to finish this world!"
"Nice" Lapis says: "We're almost done!"
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "Team huddle?"
Lapis says: "Team huddle."
Steven says: "One moment, please."
Steven says: "You're right."
Steven says: "This is harder than usual."
Lapis says: "You've just got to force them to stop."
Lapis says: "This is going to be a fight."
Lapis says: "They're not nice like me."
Steven says: "Uhmm..."
Lapis says: "Exactly."
Steven says: "They just don't understand that they're doing harm."
Steven says: "Y-you get it."
Steven says: "What made it click for you?"
Lapis says: "A cycle of horrible torture."
Lapis says: "But other than that, living in nature, getting creative."
Steven says: "Yeah."
Steven says: "Come on!"
Steven says: "We can do that for them."
Lapis says: "Okay."
Lapis says: "Just a little torture."
Steven says: "N-no, just the other stuff."
Lapis says: "*sighs* Fine."
Lapis says: "We'll try it your way."
The two return to the Lapides, walking backward while waving.
Steven says: "Hey, so, why don't we explore the many things that you can do that don't involve destroying worlds?"
"Mean" Lapis says: "Should we listen to him?"
"Nice" Lapis says: "He is half-Diamond."
"Nice" Lapis says: "Maybe, we should half-listen."
Steven says: "I'll take that as a "yes."
Steven says: "" Let's go."
Steven says: "*into the forest again; sighs* Look at the trees."
Steven says: "Smell the fresh air."
Steven says: "Getting any life-altering tingling sensations yet?"
"Nice" Lapis says: "Everything is so..."
"Nice" Lapis says: "bright."
"Mean" Lapis says: "*pokes leaf* I prefer only two colors- the colors of rock and mud."
Lapis says: "I understand you don't see the beauty of this, but you will."
Lapis says: "There was a time when I couldn't see it either, but I learned to appreciate organic life."
Lapis says: "It's really different and special."
Lapis says: "Maybe, try something like this."
Lapis manipulates mud to create a shape.
Steven says: "This is "meep morp."
Steven says: "" It's subjective and debatable, but it is meep morp nonetheless."
"Mean" Lapis says: "So, you can do whatever you want with your powers, but you choose to make junk?"
Lapis says: "I-it doesn't have to be exactly this."
Lapis says: "You can create anything."
Lapis creates a sun lounger, providing Steven with mud beverage and sunglasses.
Steven says: "*drinks mud and spits it out* So lifelike."
Steven says: "I forgot."
"Mean" Lapis says: "Okay?"
Lapis says: "It's more satisfying than you think."
Lapis says: "Trust me."
Lapis says: "Just give it a try."
The Lapides create a ball of water.
Lapis says: "That's it!"
Lapis says: "Try making other shapes, too- anything you want."
So the Lapides do, but it's a spike ball, then a buzzsaw, which they throw and slice a rock behind Steven and Lapis.
"Mean" Lapis says: "That was way easier than what we've been doing."
"Nice" Lapis says: "Yeah!"
"Nice" Lapis says: "We can clear out this planet in no time!"
Lapis says: "Steven, this isn't working."
Steven says: "*approaches* A-Ahem."
Steven says: "Looks like you two still have a lot of energy to get out."
Steven says: "*chuckles Maybe, you'd like something more physical, like dance."
"Nice" Lapis says: "Dance?"
Steven says: "Just, check this out."
Steven and Lapis dance to his phone's music, but this doesn't impress "Mean" Lapis. "Nice" Lapis, meanwhile, seems to be getting the groove until she noticed "Mean" Lapis' unapproving stare.
"Nice" Lapis says: "Uh..."
"Nice" Lapis says: "let's get back to it!"
Lapis says: "I get it."
Lapis says: "This stuff won't make you feel good right away."
Lapis says: "Maybe, it never will."
Lapis says: "But, it will help you navigate your new way of feeling."
Lapis says: "If you don't like dancing, you could try expressing yourself through song."
"Mean" Lapis says: "Huh?"
Lapis worries in demonstrating, but Steven gives the encouraging nod. Begin "Why So Blue".
Lapis says: "â™« Ooo-ooo-oooh, Why so bluuu-uu-uuue,So many shades of sorrow got mixed into my hue."
Lapis says: "And each new moment just astounds me."
Lapis says: "So much I wanna do."
Lapis says: "I finally feel my colors shining through."
Lapis says: "I'm tired of the fighting."
Lapis says: "I'm tired of the blame."
Lapis says: "That mirror was a prison, and fusion was the same."
Lapis says: "What's with these new sensations that suddenly appear?"
Lapis says: "Deep as the roaring ocean."
Lapis says: "Free as the atmosphere."
Lapis says: "Ooo-ooo-oooh!"
Lapis says: "Why so bluuu-uu-uuue?"
Lapis says: "So many different reasons, but are they really true?"
Lapis says: "I wanna keep on going."
Lapis says: "Wanna be right here with you."
Lapis says: "I'd love to see your colors shining throoo-oo-ooough!"
Lapis says: "I'd love to see your colors shining throoooooooough!"
The Lapides laugh in mockery.
"Mean" Lapis says: "You really expect us to dance and sing like Pearls?"
"Mean" Lapis says: "*laughs* Forget it, Steven Universe."
"Mean" Lapis says: "You've already got a Lapis doing what you want, and look how dull it's made her, or was she always this pitiful?"
Steven says: "Th-there's no need to be hurtful."
"Mean" Lapis says: "Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh."
"Mean" Lapis says: "You've taken enough of our time."
"Mean" Lapis says: "Let's get back to it, shall we?"
The Lapides start to terraform.
Lapis says: "That's it!"
Lapis says: "I've had enough of you two."
Steven says: "Wait, we agreed we wouldn't fight."
Lapis says: "If we had done this my way, we would've been done from the start."
Steven says: "Wait!"
Lapis says: "Hey, you two!"
Lapis says: "That's enough."
"Mean" Lapis says: "Oh, look who it is."
"Nice" Lapis says: "Have you decided to give us a hand?"
Lapis says: "You could say that."
Lapis forms hands from her wings, which flick the Lapides away.
"Nice" Lapis says: "Did she just do that?"
"Mean" Lapis says: "She did that."
"Mean" Lapis says: "*manipulates below water with "Nice" Lapis* Water hands, huh?"
"Mean" Lapis says: "Mind if we try?"
The water hand slaps Lapis from the sky and is heading to Steven and the bud creatures.
Steven says: "*gasps* Oh, boy."
Steven says: "*summons shield to protect himself, also holding Lapis* Lapis!"
Steven says: "Are you okay?"
Lapis says: "I'm fine."
Lapis says: "Stay out of it."
"Mean" Lapis says: "Water chains?"
"Nice" Lapis says: "You really need to stop teaching us new things."
Lapis is caught by a chain and smashed to the edge wall, then held bound.
Steven says: "Lapis!"
"Nice" Lapis says: "We really have to thank you for all the wonderful things you taught us today."
"Mean" Lapis says: "Turns out, they're not totally useless."
The Lapides create a saw and throw it at Lapis.
Steven says: "Look out!"
Lapis dissipates the saw and causes the area to rumble. Water flows into the area and washes the Lapides over. The former surrounds Lapis to form a giant figure of herself that she controls.
Lapis says: "WHO'S DULL NOW?"
Lapis says: "WHO'S PITIFUL NOW?!"
Lapis says: "!"
Lapis creates a water harpoon, terrifying the Lapides into submission. However, a glance at Steven stops her, and she returns to the edge.
Steven says: "Hey."
Steven says: "You okay?"
Bud creature jumps from Steven to Lapis.
Lapis says: "Yeah."
Lapis says: "Sorry about that."
The water disappears, and Lapis and Steven approach the Lapides.
Lapis says: "Hey."
Lapis says: "We're done."
Lapis says: "No more fighting."
"Nice" Lapis says: "Sure!"
"Mean" Lapis says: "Fine by me!"
Lapis says: "And no more terraforming."
Lapis says: "You'll leave this planet alone?"
"Nice" Lapis says: "Uh huh!"
"Mean" Lapis says: "After that ridiculous show of strength, we'll do anything you say!"
Lapis says: "That wasn't strength!"
Lapis says: "That was weakness."
Lapis says: "Restraint takes strength."
Lapis says: "Patience takes strength!"
Lapis says: "..."
Lapis says: "Ugh."
Lapis says: "*walks away* I don't have the strength to deal with you."
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "Here's some brochures for our school in case you're interested."
Trans. Int. Little Homeschool.
Lapis says: "I wish I hadn't done that."
Lapis says: "It's just..."
Lapis says: "they reminded me so much of myself."
Lapis says: "It's infuriating."
Steven says: "Give yourself a break."
Steven says: "You've grown a lot."
Steven says: "It's not your fault they're stuck in their ways."
Lapis smiles from that statement. Suddenly, "Nice" Lapis warps in.
"Nice" Lapis says: "Uh, so, is this that school you mentioned?"
Lapis says: "Yeah!"
Lapis says: "Welcome."
