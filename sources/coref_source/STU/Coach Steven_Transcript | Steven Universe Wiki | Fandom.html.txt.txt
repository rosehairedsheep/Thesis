Open Ext. Gem Communication Hub.
The Crystal Gems arrives by warping to the Warp Pad at the Gem Communication Hub.
Steven says: "*looks up amazed* WOAH!"
Steven says: "What magical place of mystery is this?"
Amethyst says: "Well—"
Pearl says: "*interrupts Amethyst* Oh, I'm so glad you asked!"
Pearl says: "This was once a communication hub for Gem-kind."
Pearl says: "*walks over to the pillars of the hub* But lately, it's begun transmitting bursts of electromagnetic interference!"
Steven says: "Whazzat mean?"
Garnet says: "It's hurting television."
Steven says: "Noooooooo!"
Steven says: "I'll save you television!"
Steven says: "HA-YAH!"
Amethyst says: "*lifts Steven up* Sorry, but we need a Steven at least..."
Amethyst says: "THIS strong for this job!"
Steven says: "*gasps* It's all the me I could be!"
Amethyst puts Steven down, and starts punching at the pillar as the strong Steven. Pearl catches a small piece of the pillar punched off by Amethyst and begins lecturing her.
Pearl says: "Amethyst, we could be here all day taking out these pillars individually."
Amethyst says: "Ugh, I hate it when you're right."
Amethyst says: "You get this look on your face..."
Amethyst says: "*looks at Pearl's face* Yeah, that's the one."
Pearl says: "What we need is a well thought out plan—"
Pearl's gem starts to project a hologram, when Garnet interrupts.
Garnet says: "No."
Garnet says: "What we need is Sugilite."
Garnet says: "Amethyst, fuse with me."
Amethyst says: "WHAAAT?!"
Pearl says: "WHAAAT?!"
Amethyst says: "!"
Pearl says: "!"
Amethyst begins to scream in excitement and Pearl looks annoyed.
Amethyst says: "Yeah!"
Amethyst says: "Let's mash it up!"
Amethyst says: "Bigger, badder, better!"
Amethyst says: "Ohohohohoho!"
Steven says: "Hold your horses!"
Steven says: "Are..."
Steven says: "you guys going to become a Gem Fusion?"
Amethyst replies excitedly with a scream. Steven joins in the screaming in excitement too.
Pearl says: "WAIT!"
Pearl says: "*turns to Garnet* Garnet, think about this."
Pearl says: "You and Amethyst can be a little..."
Pearl says: "eheh..."
Pearl says: "unstable when your personalities combine."
Pearl says: "We need to be careful!"
Pearl says: "Fuse with me, instead."
Garnet says: "*places her hand over Pearl's shoulder* We don't need to be careful."
Garnet says: "We just need to be huge."
Amethyst says: "Oh, yeah!"
Amethyst says: "Let's wreck this joint!"
Garnet says: "Synchronize."
Garnet's gemstones begin to glow as she starts to dance.
Steven says: "*eyes gets covered by Pearl* Wha-?"
Steven says: "Whu-?"
Steven says: "Pearrrl..."
Steven says: "Come on!"
Steven says: "I wanna see!"
Garnet and Amethyst continues their fusion dance, fusing together and forming Sugilite.
Sugilite says: "Hahahahaha!"
Sugilite says: "*laughs and cracks knuckles* I forgot how GREAT it feels to be ME!"
Steven says: "That's Sugilite?"
Sugilite says: "You got it, baby."
Sugilite says: "Hey, Steven."
Sugilite says: "Wanna see something cool?"
Steven says: "Yeah!"
Sugilite summons Garnet's gauntlets and Amethyst's whip, and fuses them together to form her flail. Steven gasps loudly in amazement.
Sugilite says: "You like that, little man?"
Steven says: "Are you gonna smash stuff with your wrecking-ball-thingy?"
Sugilite says: "That's the plan!"
Sugilite says: "Where should I start?"
Steven says: "Do that one!"
Sugilite proceeds to smash some pillars with her flails.
Pearl says: "Steven, I think we should go."
Steven says: "No way!"
Steven says: "This is awesome!"
Sugilite continues smashing more pillars, causing debris to fall everywhere.
Pearl says: "Watch it!"
Pearl kicks away a debris heading towards her, but a small rock then hits Steven in the face, knocking him onto the ground.
Pearl says: "Steven!"
Pearl says: "*yells at Sugilite* Ugh, you're just too much!"
Sugilite says: "Maybe you're just too LITTLE!"
Pearl says: "Steven, we're going!"
Steven says: "What?"
Steven says: "I'm fine!"
Steven says: "What about Sugilite?"
Pearl says: "She can find her own way home!"
Steven says: "Awww..."
Pearl and Steven warp away, just before a huge rock destroys the Warp Pad.
Trans. Int. Big Donut.
Steven enters the Big Donut wearing sunglasses and a big roll of gauze wrapped around his head.
Steven says: "'Sup?"
Sadie says: "Whoa!"
Sadie says: "Steven, what happened to you?"
Steven says: "Oh just a little battle damage from our last mission."
Sadie says: "Really?"
Lars says: "Like what?"
Steven says: "I got hit by a rock!"
Steven lifts up his gauze, revealing a tiny cut on his forehead. Both Sadie and Lars starts laughing at Steven's "battle damage".
Sadie says: "It must not have been a very big rock."
Steven says: "*covers up the cut in embarrassment* Well..."
Steven says: "there's..."
Steven says: "internal..."
Steven says: "bleeding."
Steven says: "My hurt is on the inside!"
Lars says: "*keeps laughing* Toughen UP, Steven!"
Steven says: "You're right."
Steven says: "I'm soft."
Lars says: "If I weren't so modest, I'd whip out my sweet six-pack."
Lars says: "*struggles to open a can of sardines* And show you what..."
Lars says: "a real man..."
Lars says: "looks like!"
Lars says: "..."
Sadie offers to open the can. Lars passes the can to her and she opens it with ease, returning it to Lars.
Lars says: "Nah..."
Lars says: "I'm not gonna say thanks."
Lars says: "*gets punched in the leg by Sadie* Aha..."
Lars says: "aha..."
Lars says: "."
Steven says: "That's it!"
Steven says: "We all need a workout!"
Steven says: "Let's do it!"
Steven says: "Let's workout together!"
Steven says: "*points to Sadie* You can beat up Lars!"
Steven says: "*turns to Lars* And you don't have to starve to death if Sadie divorces you!"
Lars says: "We're not married!"
Steven says: "And I know just the guy to help us out."
Trans. Ext. Beach House.
Greg is fast asleep on a workbench, after constructing a makeshift gym on the beach. Steven, Lars and Sadie arrive wearing workout outfits.
Steven says: "Wow!"
Steven says: "This looks great!"
Greg says: "Huh?"
Greg says: "Wha..."
Greg says: "?"
Steven says: "Hey, dad!"
Greg says: "Hey, Steven."
Greg says: "You like it?"
Greg says: "It's the best I can do on such short notice."
Lars says: "*picks up a dumbbell made of cans, which quickly falls apart* No kidding."
Greg says: "Well I might join you kids show you how it's done!"
Greg says: "I've been slacking off on my workout routine for few weeks..."
Greg says: "months..."
Greg says: "years..."
Greg says: "*coughs* Decades."
Steven says: "Sure!"
Steven says: "The more the meatier!"
Steven says: "Oh!"
Steven says: "We'll need sweat bands!"
Steven runs up to the his house. Pearl then passes by the gym as Greg picks up a real dumbbell.
Greg says: "Hey Pearl."
Greg says: "Come to check out some buff studs?"
Pearl says: "..."
Pearl says: "No."
Pearl says: "*walks up to Steven's house* Steven, what on earth are you up to?"
Steven says: "We're starting a gym!"
Steven says: "*flexes* Imma get supa strong!"
Steven says: "Like Sugilite!"
Pearl says: "You know, maybe this isn't a good idea."
Steven says: "What?"
Steven says: "I wanna be strong so I can be useful to the team!"
Pearl says: "There are..."
Pearl says: "different ways of being strong..."
Steven says: "But I want to be strong in the real way."
Steven says: "Come on, Pearl."
Steven says: "*puts on a sweatband* Let's get beefy!"
Pearl says: "*pouts* I'd rather not."
Pearl sighs as she closes the door behind. She then begins to sing "Strong in the Real Way" as she picks up Steven's clothes on the floor. She sees everyone working out through the windows and pulls down the blinds in disapproval. All the while, Steven is peeking and eavesdropping on Pearl's song. Determined, Steven turns up the volume of his stereo and yells into his megaphone at the gym.
Steven says: "Who's ready to get buff?"
Steven says: "I don't wanna see your gut, I wanna see your guts!"
Steven sees Pearl looking at them from the porch, but she quickly looks away and goes back inside the house. Steven then continues singing "Strong in the Real Way" his own way while instructing and inspiring everyone with the workout. After he stops singing, everyone is visibly tired out.
Sadie says: "Hey, Steven."
Sadie says: "Maybe um..."
Sadie says: "you can work out a bit, too?"
Steven says: "Uh-huh?"
Steven says: "I have been."
Lars says: "We've been working out."
Lars says: "you've just been singing some dumb song."
Greg says: "But you're doing a great job pumping us up!"
Steven says: "Thanks!"
Steven says: "But I need to get strong, too."
Steven says: "I'm switching to four-wheel drive!"
Time Skip — The next day at sunrise.
Sadie, Lars, and Greg are all waiting outside the house for Steven.
Sadie says: "Steven, come on!"
Sadie says: "We're ready to get started!"
Sadie says: "We can't work out without your mad coaching skills!"
Trans. Int. Steven's Room.
Steven says: "*groans in pain* Be there in a sec!"
Steven says: "*struggles to get off of bed and down the stairs* So sore from getting ripped..."
Pearl says: "I don't understand."
Pearl says: "Amethyst and Garnet still aren't back yet."
Pearl says: "I tried to warp back and check on them, but the warp pad's down!"
Suddenly, the ground starts to shake and voices can be heard outside.
Greg says: "What?!"
Lars says: "What?!"
Greg says: "!"
Lars says: "!"
Sadie says: "Are you seeing this too?!"
Sadie says: "!"
The house starts to rumble and crumbles falls from the ceiling.
Pearl says: "Wha-!"
Steven says: "Wha-!"
Pearl and Steven quickly exit the house and see Sugilite in the distance, marching towards them in the ocean.
Greg says: "What the hey is that?!"
Greg says: "!"
Lars says: "*falls off from the makeshift monkey bars* Oohoomph!"
Sugilite arrives at the beach and everyone runs away in fear.
Sugilite says: "*roars* I'M BORED!!!!!"
Steven says: "It's Sugilite!"
Pearl says: "*approaches Sugilite* Y-you're back!"
Sugilite says: "YOU LEFT ME BEHIND!"
Pearl says: "We just thought you didn't need any help."
Pearl says: "Now why don't you separate, and we can all sit down and relax?"
Sugilite says: "NO!"
Steven says: "Pearl!"
Pearl says: "Listen to me!"
Pearl says: "You've been fused for too long!"
Pearl says: "You're losing yourselves!"
Sugilite says: "I AM MYSELF!"
Sugilite says: "AND I'M SICK OF BEING SPLIT UP!"
Sugilite says: "SO YOU BETTER GET USED TO IT, BABY."
Sugilite says: "AND GET THIS JUNK OFF MY BEACH!"
Steven says: "*struggles over to Pearl* Why is she wrecking Dad's gym?"
Steven says: "Why is she attacking you?!"
Steven says: "!"
Pearl says: "*lifts Steven up and tosses him away* Steven, get out of here!"
Steven says: "*lands stomach-down on the ground and is stuck limp* I..."
Steven says: "can't..."
Steven says: "move..."
Pearl summons her spear and stances herself for battle.
Sugilite says: "WHAT?"
Sugilite says: "YOU WANNA FIGHT?!"
Sugilite says: "!"
Pearl says: "You'll thank me..."
Pearl says: "LATER!!"
Pearl leaps towards Sugilite, but she is quickly swatted away.
Greg says: "Come on, kid!"
Steven says: "Dad, no!"
Steven says: "Pearl!"
Pearl stands back up and leaps off again, this time, managing to knock off Sugilite's visor.
Sugilite says: "YOU THINK YOU'RE SOMETHING?"
Sugilite says: "YOU!"
Sugilite says: "*headbutts Pearl to the ground* AIN'T!"
Sugilite says: "*hits Pearl into the sky* NOTHING!"
Sugilite then attempts to crush Pearl with her flail, but barely misses her. It also sends Steven and Greg flying some distance into the sand and damages Steven's house.
Steven says: "My muscles!"
Pearl says: "Steven!"
Pearl says: "Ughh..."
Pearl says: "*kneels in pain and starts to cry* I'm sorry..."
Pearl says: "Steven, Garnet, Amethyst..."
Pearl says: "*sniffs* I wasn't strong enough, to protect you."
Pearl says: "I'm not strong enough to do anything..."
Steven then sees the megaphone nearby and crawls towards it.
Steven says: "*using the megaphone* Come on, Pearl!"
Steven says: "Don't give up!"
Steven says: "I know you can take her down!"
Pearl says: "I can't..."
Steven says: "Yes, you can!"
Steven says: "Come on!"
Steven says: "You always knew what to do!"
Steven says: "You gotta show her what you showed me!"
Steven says: "That you're strong, Pearl!"
Steven says: "Strong in the REAL WAY!"
Pearl looks up at the Crystal Temple and, regaining some confidence, slowly pulls herself back on her feet.
Sugilite says: "WHAT?"
Sugilite says: "YOU WANT SOME MORE?!"
Sugilite says: "!"
Pearl says: "Anytime!"
Pearl says: "You're no MATCH for me!"
Pearl says: "Not even close!"
Sugilite punches towards Pearl, which she dodges and then runs away. Sugilite then chases after Pearl up to the lighthouse on the cliff.
Steven says: "GO!!!"
Sugilite says: "GET BACK HERE!"
Pearl leaps off the cliff.
Sugilite says: "*laughs* NICE TRY."
Sugilite starts swinging her flail. Pearl then hurls her spear at the ground underneath Sugilite, causing her to lose her footing, fall off the cliff and crash onto the beach.
Sugilite says: "IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?"
Sugilite says: "YOU THINK THAT'S ENOUGH TO BE—"
Sugilite's flail lands smack on her head, separating her back into Garnet and Amethyst in a poof of purple cloud.
Pearl says: "Amethyst!"
Pearl says: "Garnet!"
Pearl says: "Are you OK!"
Pearl says: "?"
Garnet says: "Yeah..."
Garnet says: "Sugilite just overworked our bodies."
Garnet says: "It's..."
Garnet says: "a little painful."
Amethyst says: "I've got a monster headache."
Pearl pulls Garnet and Amethyst for a tearful hug. Garnet and Amethyst groan in pain as the sound of bone cracking is heard, causing Pearl to quickly release them.
Pearl says: "Oh, whoops."
Steven says: "Pearl, you did it!"
Pearl says: "Thanks."
Pearl says: "You make a good coach."
Garnet says: "Pearl, we should've listened..."
Garnet says: "You were right."
Pearl says: "Yeah."
Pearl says: "I was right."
Steven says: "Go, Pearl!"
Pearl says: "Come on!"
Pearl says: "I feel GREAT!"
Pearl says: "Who's up for a MISSION?"
Pearl says: "OR..."
Pearl continues shouting in the background, as two star irises zoom in on Garnet and Amethyst.
Amethyst says: "How long is she going to keep this up?"
Garnet says: "We deserve it."
Garnet says: "Take it like a Gem."
Lars says: "Uh..."
Lars says: "What the heck just happened?!"
Lars says: "!"
Steven says: "DROP AND GIVE ME 20!!!!!!!!"
END.
