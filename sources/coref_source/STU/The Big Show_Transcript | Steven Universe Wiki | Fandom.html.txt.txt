Sadie says: "♪ But I'd really rather be, ♪ Eating your brain!"
Steven says: "Whoo-hoo!"
Jenny says: "Just another hot track from Sadie Killer and the Suspects."
Sadie says: "How's it sound, Sour Cream?"
Sour Cream says: "Here, check it out."
Buck says: "Hey, Steven."
Buck says: "How's the footage coming?"
Steven says: "*chuckles* Great!"
Buck says: "Your documentation of our humble beginnings will be important when we become a pop-culture phenomenon."
Jenny says: "Okay, but why are you recording it on that giant shoe box?"
Steven says: "It's my dad's old camcorder."
Steven says: "These are your early days."
Steven says: "The footage has to look old."
Sadie says: "I think I could get a more guttural scream on the chorus if I rest my voice a little."
Footsteps are then heard upstairs, and Sadie quickly closes Sour Cream's laptop.
Barbara says: "Sadie!"
Barbara says: "*enters downstairs* Could you give me a hand with the gro- Oooh!"
Barbara says: "Didn't realize you had practice today."

Sadie says: "*blushing* Mooooom!"
Barbara says: "Okay, okay."
Barbara says: "I know the rule."
Barbara says: "I'll stay out of your hair."
Sadie says: "It's okay."
Sadie says: "We're done for the night."
Barbara says: "You know you can play while I'm in the house."
Barbara says: "It won't bother me."
Barbara says: "I'm old; I can't hear anything!"
Sadie says: "Heh!"
Sadie says: "Okay."
Sadie says: "Thanks, Mom."
Barbara says: "*cups her hand around her ear* What?!"
Barbara says: "!"
Barbara says: "Huh?!"
Barbara says: "!"
Barbara says: "Can't hear a thing!"

Sadie says: "♪ *covers her face with a cape* ♪ It's making me shout, it's making me change."
Sadie says: "♪ You better watch out, it's going to get loud."
Sadie says: "♪ I'm killing the stage, I'm killing the crowd!"
Sadie turns around and holds up her cape, revealing a skeleton on her back, as Sour Cream throws in a smoke bomb.
Buck says: "And you're next."
Greg says: "*clapping* Whoa!"
Greg says: "That was great!"
Greg says: "Sadie, you transform into a totally different person."
Steven says: "Yeah."
Steven says: "No more Sadie Miller."
Steven says: "She's Sadie Killer."
Sadie says: "*blushes* Heh heh."
Sadie says: "Yeah."
Sadie says: "It feels..."
Sadie says: "kind of freeing."
Greg says: "I can tell!"
Greg says: "And this whole look you guys have going is really fun!"
Greg says: "Nice wolf man, Buck."
Buck says: "I'm a witch's cat."
Jenny says: "We know our costumes look cheap."
Jenny says: "But when we make it big, we're going to have the finest tombstone hats money can buy."
Sadie says: "But that's a long ways off."
Sadie says: "We're still mostly playing, uh, well, basements."
Greg says: "That's where everyone starts."
Greg says: "Now you just got to work on the stuff that isn't music: booking shows, making merch, getting the word out."
Steven says: "Dad!"
Steven says: "You know how to do all that stuff!"
Steven says: "You could help them!"
Greg says: "What, like, be their manager?"
Steven says: "Yeah!"
Buck says: "You taught me everything I know, Mr."
Buck says: "U."
Buck says: "I think you'd be a great manager."
Sadie says: "Yeah!"
Jenny says: "Yeah, come on!"
Greg says: "Ha!"
Greg says: "I'll take the job!"
Sadie says: "Yeah!"
Cool Kids says: "Yeah!"
Sadie says: "Thanks, Mr."
Sadie says: "Universe!"
Buck says: "And so it begins: our rise to stardom, followed by the inevitable infighting and creative disagreements that will tear us apart in a beautiful explosion of emotions."
Greg says: "Don't worry."
Greg says: "That won't happen."
Buck says: "Ah, shoot."

Greg says: "Are you still booking all the coolest bands at your club?"
Greg says: "Well, listen to this!"
Greg plays Sadie's song on his laptop and holds the phone up to it. Steven gives a thumbs-up and Greg returns the thumbs-up. Shortly, Greg pulls back the phone and speaks into it again.
Greg says: "Oh, sorry."
Greg says: "It's probably hard to hear over the phone."
Greg says: "I'll e-mail you a link."
Greg says: "Yeah."
Greg says: "*laughs* Talk to you soon!"
Greg hangs up and begins typing an email, while Steven climbs inside Greg's van.
Steven says: "Who was that?"
Greg says: "*sends the e-mail* Oh, Sunshine Justice."
Greg says: "She's an old music buddy that owns a venue in Empire City."
Greg's laptop chimes shortly.
Greg says: "Oh!"
Greg says: "She replied."
Greg says: "*reads the e-mail* "This is the absolute worst recording I've ever heard."
Greg says: "It's a shame because I love the song."
Greg says: "Let's get these kids on stage with some decent equipment"?"
Greg says: "They've got a gig!"
Steven says: "*high-fives Greg* Whoo!"
Greg says: "I'll e-mail her back right away!"
Steven says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Transition effects wipe across the video, and it transitions to Steven drawing posters for Sadie Killer and the Suspects at home. Greg is talking to Sadie, Buck, and Sour Cream in the kitchen.
Greg says: "It's a big stage, so you're gonna have a lot of space we can fill up."
Sadie says: "Isn't that fog machine really expensive?"
Greg says: "The Fog Of War is one of the best units out there."
Greg says: "Go big!"
Greg says: "It's on my tab."
Sour Cream says: "When you say, "Big", you mean, like, glow sticks in every color?"
Greg says: "Bigger!"
Greg says: "I'm talking lasers!"
Sour Cream says: "Lasers?!"
Sour Cream says: "!"
Trans. Ext. It's a Wash.
The video transitions to outside of Greg's car wash, where Jenny and Buck arrive with packages to show to the rest of the band.

Jenny says: "*shows off her Sadie Killer and the Suspects shirt* Check it."
Steven says: "Oh-ho-ho!"
Sour Cream says: "Nice!"
Jenny says: "*poses* Scary and stylish."
Just then, Barbara arrives with some more packages.
Sour Cream says: "Huh?"
Sour Cream says: "The Fog Of War and our lasers..."
Sour Cream says: "and Barb!"
Barbara says: "These all got your name on them, Greg."
Barbara says: "You building a new car wash or something?"
Greg says: "*chuckles* It's all for Sadie Killer and the Suspects."
Barbara says: "Huh?"
Greg says: "Your daughter's band?"
Greg says: "I'm their manager."
Barbara says: "What are you talking about?"
Barbara says: "An old duffer like you managing a band?"
Sadie says: "*interrupts nervously* In some no-name city."
Sadie says: "It's not a big deal."
Sadie accidentally knocks over a poster and the poster unrolls in front of Barbara.
Barbara says: "*reading the poster* "Sadie Killer and the Suspects, live at Empire Ci--" *gasps* My girl is playing in Empire City?!"
Barbara says: "!"
Barbara says: "This is a huge deal!"
Barbara says: "Oh, my gosh."
Barbara says: "Geez."
Barbara says: "If you need to carry all this stuff and your instruments, I-I can probably use the mail truck if I ask nice."
Barbara says: "And I can definitely use it if I don't ask."
Barbara says: "Oh!"
Sadie says: "Mom!"
Sadie says: "We've talked about this!"
Steven says: "Uhh..."
Steven says: "Sadie?"
Sadie says: "The band is my thing, and I just want to be able to do it on my own."
Barbara says: "..."
Barbara says: "Right, right."
Barbara says: "You need your space."
Barbara says: "I understand."
Barbara says: "You kids be safe and have a good show, huh?"
Sadie watches on as Barbara drives away in her mail truck. The video transitions again to the Cool Kids testing out the Fog Of War in front of the car wash.
Sour Cream says: "Ready the cords."
Buck says: "Here I go."
Buck plugs the power cord in and Sour Cream turns the fog machine on, causing it to produce a prodigious amount of fog and engulfing Jenny in it.
Jenny says: "Whoa!"
Jenny and Sour Cream laugh in delight, as Steven pans the camcorder towards Sadie and Greg by the van.
Sadie says: "Ohh."
Sadie says: "Ugh."
Sadie says: "*pulls her face* My mom used to be so into my life, it was suffocating."
Sadie says: "But now I get to be Sadie Killer, and it's something that's totally mine, and I know she's just waiting to get her hands on it."
Greg says: "Wow."
Greg says: "That's so funny."
Sadie says: "How is it funny?"
Sadie says: "It drives me nuts!"
Greg says: "Oh, no."
Greg says: "It's just back in the day, my parents didn't want anything to do with my music."
Greg says: "They thought I was throwing my life away."
Greg says: "They never came to one of my shows."
Greg says: "They never even wanted to hear about them."
Sadie says: "Really?"
Greg says: "It's kind of amazing that your mom is excited about your band."
Greg says: "It's just..."
Greg says: "really nice to see."
Sadie says: "Yeah."
Sadie says: "Yeah..."
Sadie says: "I-I guess you're right."

Sour Cream says: "Yeah."
Sour Cream says: "Like, didn't your dad teach you?"
Sour Cream says: "He used to wear them every day."
Buck says: "*wearing a tie like a scarf* They were clip-ons."
Steven pans the camcorder towards Sadie, who is putting on a ghostly makeup in front of a mirror.
Steven says: "Sadie!"
Steven says: "What's up?"
Steven says: "Are you nervous?"
Sadie says: "No, no."
Sadie says: "I'm just, umm..."
Sadie says: "*gets up* Just getting ready."
Sadie and Steven walk to the stage curtain and peek out at the audience.
Steven says: "Sounds like a big crowd out there."
Steven says: "Wait."
Steven says: "Is that..."
Steven zooms in towards a woman in the audience who strongly resembles Barbara, and Sadie notices too.
Sadie says: "Mom?!"
Sadie says: "!"
Sadie says: "*gets agitated* Does she think she can just show up in some wacky disguise and I won't know it's her?!"
Sadie says: "!"
Sadie says: "It's so obvious!"
Steven says: "Maybe she should have gotten some costume tips from you."
Greg says: "Okay, guys."
Greg says: "You're on in 5."
Time-Skip; Showtime.
The video transitions again, Steven is filming Sadie Killer and the Suspects from the audience. Jenny, Buck, and Sour Cream are already onstage, as a coffin prop rises out of the stage. Sadie bursts out of the coffin, and the band begins to perform "G-G-G-Ghost".
Sadie says: "♪ I used to be sick, sick and tired."
Sadie says: "♪ Delirious, dizzy, terrified."
Sadie says: "♪ But I'm suddenly up and out of bed."
Sadie says: "♪ You'd never believe I was almost..."
Sadie begins walking up to each of the Cool Kids, as they act that they are unable not to see her.
Sadie says: "♪ Why can't you see me?"
Sadie says: "♪ Why can't you see me?"
Sadie says: "' ♪ I think I might be, ♪ A g-g-g-ghost."
Sadie walks back to the coffin and knocks it over.
Sadie says: "♪ Awww-aahhh!"
Sadie says: "♪ Can't you see that I exist?"
Sadie says: "♪ And I don't need an exorcist, ♪ To let~ me~ out?"
Sadie begins throwing confetti from the coffin everywhere.
Sadie says: "♪ Look at me, and I'll appear."
Sadie says: "♪ Why can't you see that I'm right here?"
Sadie says: "♪ That I'm~ right~ here."
Sadie points and winks at the woman who resembles Barbara in the audience, and begins throwing confetti at each of the Cool Kids, who reacts like they sense her presence.
Sadie says: "♪ Why can't you see me?"
Sadie says: "♪ Why can't you see me?"
Sadie says: "♪ I think I might be..."
Sadie says: "♪ A g-g-g-ghost..."
Sadie sits in front of the coffin, slumps over and drops her microphone. The Cool Kids walk over and place their hands on Sadie, as she "levitates" into the air.
Sadie Pre-recorded.
Sadie is raised into the air by a rope, lifting up her arms briefly before going slack. The song concludes, and the audience cheers and applauds.

Sour Cream says: "Sadie, you nailed that ending."
Just then, the woman who resembled Barbara walks backstage towards the group.
Sadie says: "Oh!"
Greg says: "Sunshine Justice!"
Sunshine says: "How you been, Greg?"
Sunshine says: "*raises her sunglasses* Where'd you find these kids?"
Sunshine says: "Reminds me of your old space gimmick, except people actually like it."
Greg says: "Hey!"
Sunshine says: "*chuckles* I'm just kidding."
Sunshine says: "You were very ahead of your time."
Sunshine says: "But Sadie Killer and the Suspects?"
Sunshine says: "That crowd was going crazy."
Sunshine says: "You're really something."
Sunshine says: "You kids are welcome to play at the venue anytime."

Sadie says: "Oh, yeah!"

Sadie says: "Weird."
Sadie says: "I mean, good."
Sadie says: "It's just..."
Sadie says: "I went all out thinking my mom was at the show."
Sadie says: "I can't believe I kind of wanted her to be there."
Sadie says: "Well, not even kind of."
Sadie says: "I did."
Steven says: "There'll be other shows."
Steven says: "Why don't you tell her about the next one?"
Sadie says: "Hey, Mr."
Sadie says: "Universe, let's play our next show in Beach City."
Greg says: "I'll make it happen."
Steven says: "*points the camcorder to himself* That's all, folks!"
