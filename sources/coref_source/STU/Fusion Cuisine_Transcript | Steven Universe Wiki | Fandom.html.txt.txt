Open Int. Beach House.
Steven and Connie are watching "Under the Knife" on the TV together in Steven's Room.
Lady says: "Doctor, it's my son."
Lady says: "There was an accident."
Doctor says: "I know what we have to do."
Doctor says: "Nurse!"
Nurse says: "Yes, Doctor?"
Doctor says: "Prep the patient for emergency surgery."
Doctor says: "We're gonna go..."
Doctor says: "under the knife."
Connie says: "*screams happily* Ugggggh!"
Connie says: "This show is so good!"
Connie says: "Aaah!"
Connie says: "Thank you so much for letting me watch "Under the Knife" here, Steven."
Steven says: "How come you can't watch the show at home?"
Connie says: "My mom says this doesn't represent a real emergency room."
Nurse says: "How did his legs..."
Nurse says: "get into..."
Nurse says: "his brain?!"
Nurse says: "!"
Connie says: "She just doesn't understand that it's satire."
Connie's phone then begins to ring.
Steven says: "Is that your phone?"
Connie says: "It's probably my mom."
Connie says: "*retrieves her phone from her purse* Called it."
Connie says: "*puts on her glasses, clears her throat and answers the phone* Hi, Mother."
Connie says: "It's Connie."
Connie says: "Mm-hmm."
Connie says: "Yes, ma'am."
Connie says: "*looks at Steven* I'm at the home of Steven Universe."
Connie says: "Mm-hmm."
Connie says: "Yes, ma'am."
Connie says: "We're—"
Connie says: "we're just hanging out."
Connie says: "Oh..."
Connie says: "Steven's parents."
Connie says: "They're, uh—"
Connie says: "they're in the other room."
Connie says: "You would like to talk to Steven's mom?"
Connie says: "Oh, okay."
Connie says: "Hold on a moment."
Steven says: "*get worried* That's gonna be pretty hard since my mom gave up her physical form to make me."
Connie says: "*covers her phone with her hand* I can't tell her that!"
Steven and Connie both run down the steps and towards Garnet, who is chilling on the couch in the living room.
Steven says: "Garnet, quick!"
Steven says: "You have to pretend to be my mom to Connie's mom."
Garnet says: "*takes the phone* Hello."
Garnet says: "This..."
Garnet says: "is Mom Universe."
Garnet says: "Yes."
Garnet says: "*adjusts her visor* The children are playing swords."
Garnet says: "Sorry—"
Garnet says: "playing with swords."
Garnet says: "They're bleeding."
Garnet says: "Oh no, they are dead."
Garnet says: "Don't call again."
Garnet says: "*hangs up the phone and returns it to Steven* Sorry, I panicked."
Steven and Connie both look shocked.
Time Skip.
Steven chats over the phone with Connie while dressing a cake in his kitchen.
Steven says: "Aw, what do you mean, your mom won't let you come over?"
Steven says: "It's the midseason pre-finale of "Under the Knife"!"
Connie says: "*at her home* Steven, my parents are really upset."
Connie says: "They say they will not let me see you again until they meet both of your parents in person."
Steven says: "But that's impossible!"
Connie says: "I know, but they want both of our families to go out together for dinner."
Steven says: "*putting cheeseballs on the cake* It sounds so..."
Steven says: "adult."
Steven says: "I wonder if Fish Stew Pizza will take reservations for-- *counting on fingers* Pearl, Garnet, Dad, Amethyst—"
Steven says: "All eight of us."
Connie says: "You can't bring everybody!"
Steven says: "Why not?"
Connie says: "Because..."
Connie says: "Because..."
Connie says: "!"
Connie says: "I told my parents you have a nuclear family!"
Steven says: "*misinterprets and gets defensive* Nuclear?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "Sure they make stuff blow up sometimes, but that's because they're magic, not radioactive!"
Connie says: "Steven, "nuclear" means two adults and their child and/or children."
Connie says: "My parents think you live with your mother and father."
Steven says: "*frowns* But none of that is true."
Steven says: "You never told your mom and dad about the Crystal Gems?"
Connie says: "No, and it has to stay that way."
Connie says: "If they find out I lied to them, they'll never let me hang out with you again."
Some time passes, Steven discusses the dinner plan with the Gems while Greg struggles to put on a sweater.
Steven says: "*pacing in front of the Gems at the kitchen* How am I supposed to choose just one of you to bring to dinner?"
Steven says: "You're all so..."
Steven says: "cool!"
Pearl says: "*disgusted* Why does it have to be dinner?"
Pearl says: "We get all the energy we need from our gems, and while our human constructs are capable of eating, I find it very uncomfortable."
Amethyst says: "I love eating!"
Amethyst says: "*chuckles* Feels weird."
Amethyst then munches on some chips from a bag loudly and grossly, spilling some bits onto Garnet's shoulders, which she quickly brushes off.
Steven says: "Okay, okay, okay."
Steven says: "Let's focus."
Steven says: "Which of you would make the best and most nuclear mom?"
Steven says: "Garnet, you keep us safe by scaring off the bad guys, just like a mom would."
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "But you're not the best conversationalist."
Steven says: "Amethyst, you would be a super fun mom!"
Amethyst is still munching on the chips, drooling from her mouth, and begins picking her nose.
Steven says: "Can moms be gross?"
Amethyst says: "Why not?"
Steven says: "*walks pass Amethyst* Pearl!"
Steven says: "You're always worried about me, you teach me lots of stuff, you're approachable, and you're, like, totally not gross."
Amethyst continues munching away with her nose still running, causing Pearl to cringe in disgust.
Steven says: "But..."
Steven says: "you can't eat dinner."
Steven says: "*walks away sadly and sits beside Greg on the couch* Man, why did Connie have to say I have one mother instead of zero..."
Steven says: "or three?"
Greg says: "We'll figure this thing out."
Greg says: "We just have to put our heads together."
Steven says: "Why didn't I think of this before?"
Steven says: "It's so obvious!"
Steven says: "You can all come to dinner!"
Steven says: "All three of you, fused into one!"
Pearl says: "What?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Amethyst says: "Whoa!"
Greg says: "What?"
Pearl says: "Steven, you know we only fuse in deadly situations!"
Steven says: "It'd be like..."
Steven says: "like I'm actually bringing my whole family!"
Amethyst says: "That's insane."
Garnet says: "Fusion is serious magic, not a trick for dinner parties."
Steven says: "I know."
Steven says: "Then I guess this is it."
Steven says: "I'll never get to see Connie again."
Steven says: "Oh, Connie!"
Steven says: "I'll never know a star that shines as bright as you."
Steven starts to weep as the Gems all look at him in sympathy.
Garnet says: "*sighs* We have no choice."
Trans. Ext. The Crab Shack Restaurant.
Connie's family is sitting outside of the restaurant, waiting for Steven's family to arrive, while slow piano music is playing in the background.
Dr. Maheswaran says: "We've been waiting for nearly 20 minutes."
The ground starts to rumble, scaring seagulls away. Connie and her parents gasp in shock and surprise as Alexandrite arrives, with Steven and Greg on her shoulders, from over the hilltops.
Mr. Maheswaran says: "*frightened* Uh..."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "Oh."
Steven says: "Hi, Connie!"
Steven says: "Hi, Mr."
Steven says: "and Mrs."
Steven says: "Maheswaran!"
Alexandrite puts Greg and Steven on the ground.
Greg says: "Thanks..."
Greg says: "honeybun..."
Greg says: "?"
Alexandrite says: "You're welcome..."
Alexandrite says: "Greg."
Greg says: "I'm Greg Universe."
Greg says: "*shakes Dr."
Greg says: "Maheswaran's hand* And this massive drink of water is my wife, Alexandrite."
Alexandrite says: "*awkwardly* Hiiiiii..."
Alexandrite says: "."
Steven, Greg and Alexandrite sit at the table. Alexandrite then grabs all the breadsticks on the table and starts munching on them.
Mr. Maheswaran says: "I hope this place has unlimited breadsticks."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "Don't be rude."
Alexandrite says: "*keeps munching* Bleh."
Greg says: "*chuckles nervously* Isn't my wife a riot?"
Dr. Maheswaran says: "So, tell me—"
Dr. Maheswaran says: "how did you two meet?"
Greg says: "Huh?"
Greg says: "How did we meet?"
Steven says: "*stands up on his seat and interrupts* They met on a roller coaster!"
Connie says: "*mouths "What?"
Steven says: "She was too tall to ride!"
Steven says: "Heh-heh."
Greg says: "*laughs nervously* Uh, I remember it like it was yesterday."
Greg says: "Right, honey?"
Greg says: "*places his hand on her leg and keeps laughing nervously* Eh..."
Greg says: "*whispers* Sorry."
Alexandrite says: "*slams Greg's face onto the table* Have some more breadsticks..."
Alexandrite says: "dear."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "Uh..."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "*coughs* What is it that you two do for a living, Mr."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "and Mrs."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "Universe?"
Steven says: "*barges in again* My mom works on an apple farm!"
Dr. Maheswaran says: "What did we say about heads on the table?"
Steven says: "She uses all her arms to pick apples out of huge trees."
Greg says: "Well, you know what they say: An apple a day keeps the doctor away."
Alexandrite says: "Yes, I hate doctors."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "Well, I'm a doctor."
Connie says: "Steven, help me find the restroom!"
Trans. Int. The Crab Shack.
Connie leads Steven to the restrooms, holding her hands on her head in annoyance.
Steven says: "Things are going pretty good so far, huh?"
Connie says: "Steven, are you kidding me?!"
Connie says: "!"
Connie says: "What is this thing that you brought to dinner?!"
Connie says: "!"
Steven says: "Iit's my family."
Steven says: "It's all of the Gems, fused together into a..."
Steven says: "six-armed, giant woman."
Connie says: "Why couldn't you just bring one of the Gems?"
Steven says: "'Cause that would be a lie."
Steven says: "*squirts his eyes at Connie* Your..."
Steven says: "glasses..."
Connie says: "What about them?"
Steven says: "I healed your eyes."
Steven says: "You don't even need to wear those anymore."
Connie says: "What are you talking about?"
Steven says: "All that stuff you told your parents about my family, you're just ashamed of me!"
Connie says: "Oh, whatever, Steven."
Connie says: "Let's just focus on getting through the evening."
Connie and Steven, both now annoyed, return back to the table, when a waiter is serving food to the group.
Connie says: "So, Steven was telling me that on his mom's apple farm, they're bioengineering a gala-fuji hybrid."
Steven says: "Yes, that's definitely true."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "Isn't that right, Mrs."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "Universe?"
Alexandrite picks up a cooked shrimp with a fork, sniffs it hard and tries to eat it.
Alexandrite Pearl.
Alexandrite Amethyst.
Alexandrite Pearl.
Alexandrite Garnet.
Alexandrite begins to fight herself, throwing an uppercut at her face and chomping her hand, as the group watches on.
Steven says: "Stop!"
Steven says: "You don't have to eat it!"
Alexandrite's face begins to crack, causing Dr. and Mr. Maheswaran to gasp in horror, as she gets up and unfuses back into Garnet, Pearl and Amethyst.
Pearl says: "Steven!"
Pearl says: "*crawls towards him* Ohh."
Pearl says: "Thank you so much."
Pearl says: "You don't know how horrified I was when that dreck nearly fell into our mouths."
Pearl says: "Eating food is so disgusting!"
Pearl says: "You chew it into nasty mush, swallow that goop, and it comes out of you?"
Pearl says: "What a completely horrid experience!"
Amethyst says: "Uh, speak for yourself."
Amethyst says: "Ha!"
Amethyst says: "I love it when mush passes through my body."
Garnet says: "It doesn't matter what you two think."
Garnet says: "We're doing this for Steven!"
Pearl says: "Oow!"
Amethyst says: "Oow!"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "What is going on here?"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "Who are they?!"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "!"
Dr. Maheswaran says: "*turns to Connie* I knew I should have trusted my bad feelings about this new friend of yours, but I never thought I wouldn't be able to trust my own daughter."
Connie runs off.
Steven says: "Connie!"
Steven catches up to Connie at a bus stop next to the Crab Shack restaurant.
Steven says: "Connie."
Connie says: "Steven, I'm so sorry."
Connie says: "It's not that I'm ashamed of you."
Connie says: "I was so worried that my parents would think all this magic stuff is weird."
Connie says: "What if they don't let me hang out with you anymore?"
Steven says: "I-I'm sorry I messed everything up."
Steven says: "I wish there was a way we could just..."
Steven says: "hang out without having to worry about stuff."
Connie says: "Steven, let's just hop on a bus and live somewhere else without telling anyone!"
Steven says: "That's a great idea!"
A bus pulls up to the bus stop, and Steven and Connie board it. They sit down at the back of the bus.
Steven says: "Where's this bus taking us?"
Connie says: "Wherever we end up."
Connie says: "We'll find a way to survive."
Connie says: "I've been reading about sustainable living."
Steven says: "Maybe it'll take us to a real apple farm!"
Connie says: "What's up with you and apples today?"
Steven says: "Huh?"
Connie says: "Huh?"
The ground starts to rumble. Steven and Connie looks out the back of the the bus and see Alexandrite charging towards them.
Alexandrite says: "STEVEEEENN!!!!"
Steven says: "Aaaaaah!"
Connie says: "Aaaaaah!"
Alexandrite says: "*grabs the bus and picks it up off the ground* You two!"
Alexandrite says: "Come out of that bus this instant!"
Steven says: "Aah!"
Steven says: "Okay!"
Steven says: "J-Just put the bus down first."
Trans. Ext. The Crab Shack.
Steven and Connie are reunited back to their respective families, as they begin to reprimand the two of them.
Pearl says: "What were you thinking, running off with Connie like that?"
Pearl says: "You could have gotten yourselves hurt!"
Garnet says: "Or gotten mangled in traffic."
Amethyst says: "Or thrown in prison."
Pearl says: "Steven, you are in very big trouble, and we have no choice but to punish you."
Steven says: "But..."
Garnet says: "No dinner for 1,000 years."
Steven says: "*saddened* 1,000..."
Steven says: "?!"
Steven says: "!"
Pearl says: "We would never starve you, but you will lose your TV privileges..."
Pearl says: "for 1,000 years."
Steven says: "NOOO!"
Steven says: "The midseason pre-finale of "Under the Knife"!"
Steven says: "How can you do this to me?!"
Steven says: "!"
Greg says: "*in disappointment* Because we love you, Steven."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "Wow."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "*approaches Greg and the Crystal Gems* That was a masterful use of the "because we love you" shutdown."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "I'm quite partial to the "It's for your own good!"
Dr. Maheswaran says: "" myself."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "That "1,000 years of no dinner" bit, was pretty funny."
Garnet says: "All comedy is derived from fear."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "*laughs* You are too much."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "I did not know what to make of the two of- Excuse me, four of you, but I see that you are responsible parents."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "Uh, caregivers?"
Dr. Maheswaran says: "Guardians."
Connie says: "So, I can still hang out with Steven?"
Dr. Maheswaran says: "Sure."
Steven says: "Alright!"
Dr. and Mr. Maheswaran grunts at the sight of Steven hugging their daughter. Mr. Mahaswaran then steps in and separates the two from the hug, as the star iris zoom in on Mr. Maheswaran's satisfied face.
END.
