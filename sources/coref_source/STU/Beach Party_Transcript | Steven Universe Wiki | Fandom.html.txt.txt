Open Beach.
The Crystal Gems are seen under attack on the beach, as Steven and Amethyst are screaming and thrown across the sand, while Garnet and Pearl land steadily on their feet.
Pearl says: "You okay, Steven?"
Steven says: "*lying on his stomach on a boogie board* I've seen better days."
Amethyst says: "Pearl, I got a boo-boo."
Pearl says: "Oh, walk it off!"
Garnet says: "Here it comes!"
Garnet says: "You all distract it!"
Pearl says: "Let's show this thing what we're made of, guys!"
Amethyst says: "What do you think we've been doing for the past hour?"
Pearl hurls her spear at the pufferfish monster, but the pufferfish blows it back to them.
Pearl says: "Duck!"
Amethyst says: "*looks around* Man, I don't see any duc—"
Amethyst says: "*notices the spear and ducks at the last second, as the spear chops some of her head* Quack!"
Steven says: "Steven's turn!"
Steven says: "*throws the boogie board and it gets stuck to the one of the pufferfish monster's spikes* Yup, it's got spikes."
Amethyst says: "It's okay."
Amethyst says: "*rests her arm on Steven's shoulder* Here comes Garnet!"
Garnet begins diving sky-high towards the pufferfish monster.
Steven says: "*yells* Smash that puff!"
The pufferfish monster notices Garnet and starts blowing at her. Garnet tries to force her way through, but the wind is too strong. She is then blown away and sent flying and screaming towards Beach City, smashing into the Fish Stew Pizza restaurant.
Steven says: "Aw, man, we blew it!"
Amethyst says: "Ugh, whatever!"
Amethyst charges up to the pufferfish monster. Just the monster begins to blow at her, Amethyst shapeshifts into a baseball bat and whacks the monster, sending it flying far into the ocean. She then shapeshifts back to normal shortly.
Pearl says: "Amethyst!"
Pearl says: "Smacking it really far away doesn't solve anything!"
Pearl says: "We needed to destroy it."
Pearl says: "Now it's just gonna come back later."
Amethyst says: "Yeah, so we'll deal with it later."
Pearl says: "Ugh!"
Steven says: "Let's get Garnet."
Steven says: "She landed by the boardwalk."
Trans. Ext. Fish Stew Pizza.
Garnet is lying calmly and still on the wrecked sign of Fish Stew Pizza while Kiki and Kofi Pizza look up at her.
Kofi says: "*yelling* Would you answer me?!"
Kofi says: "!"
Kofi says: "?!"
Kofi says: "!"
Kofi says: "You've wrecked my sign, and now you're just sitting up there!!"
Kofi says: "Are we engaged in a secret staring contest?!"
Kofi says: "!"
Steven says: "*arrives with Pearl and Amethyst* Garnet!"
Steven says: "Are you okay?"
Garnet says: "*jumps off the building* I'm fine."
Kiki says: "Hi, Steven."
Amethyst says: "*looking and laughing at the building sign* This place is wrecked!"
Amethyst says: "Gimme one down low!"
Pearl says: "No accolades for you, Amethyst!"
Pearl says: "*turns to Garnet* She knocked the pufferfish back out into the ocean!"
Amethyst says: "Narc!"
Garnet says: "Let's regroup back at the temple."
The Gems leaps away, leaving Steven before.
Kofi says: "Where are you going?"
Kofi says: "What about my sign?"
Kofi says: "*turns to Steven* Steven!"
Kofi says: "What is wrong with your friends?"
Kofi says: "One of them busted up my sign, then they all just jump into the sky like some circus act, without even offering to help!"
Steven says: "But, Mr."
Steven says: "Pizza!"
Jenny says: "*exits the restaurant* Da-ad, pipe down!"
Kofi says: "Ohhh!"
Kofi says: "Did I interrupt your beauty sleep?"
Jenny says: "*yawns* I don't need sleep to look pretty."
Kofi says: "Now you listen here, young woman-!"
Nanefua appears at the doorway of the restaurant holding a dead fish.
Nanefua says: "Kofi, you are going to wake this fish from the dead with all the noise you're keeping."
Nanefua says: "Oh, too late."
Nanefua says: "*pretends to be the fish* Kofi, you so loud!"
Nanefua says: "Aaaahh!"
Nanefua says: "*sticks her tongue out* Bleeeeeh."
Jenny says: "Gunga, you're so funny."
Kofi says: "Mooom!"
Kofi says: "Quit joking around!"
Kofi says: "Look what they did to my sign!"
Nanefua says: "*exits the building looks at the sign* Cheese on bread."
Kofi says: "Can you believe it?"
Kofi says: "You're such a nice boy, Steven."
Kofi says: "Why do you hang out with those animals?"
Steven says: "They're not animals!"
Steven says: "They're the Crystal Gems, and they protect humanity—"
Kofi says: "I've heard enough!"
Nanefua says: "*glances nervously at Kofi and Steven* Hey, girls, I think I hear all of our cellphones ringing."
Jenny says: "*plays along* Gunga, your hearing is so good!"
Kofi says: "Steven, you can tell your friends that they are officially BANNED from Fish Stew Pizza!"
Steven says: "Wait, what?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "Kofi, that's not fair!"
Steven says: "This was just an accident!"
Kofi stomps back into the restaurant and flips the "Closed" sign at the door. Steven walks away in despair.
Trans. Int. Beach House.
The Gems are all gathered around the kitchen counter as Steven returns.
Amethyst says: "Why don't we just, like, let it roam free?"
Garnet says: "That's not an option."
Amethyst says: "*looks Steven approaching* Hey, Steven!"
Steven says: "I've got bad news, everyone."
Steven says: "You've all been banned from Fish Stew Pizza."
Pearl says: "..."
Pearl says: "Oh, uhhh, that's okay."
Amethyst says: "That pizza wasn't even good."
Steven says: "*shocked* Aren't you guys upset about this?"
Garnet says: "Not at all?"
Steven says: "But these are our neighbors!"
Garnet says: "There's nothing we can do about that now."
Pearl says: "Right now, we have to figure out a way to take care of that pufferfish."
Steven says: "What's the point of saving people if they're just gonna ban you from their pizza shops?"
Garnet says: "We don't do it for thanks."
Steven says: "Yeah, see!"
Steven says: "*nods* That's so nice of you, the Pizzas don't even know!"
Steven says: "If they got to spend some time with you they'd see *turns to Amethyst* how fun, *to Pearl* and smart, *to Garnet* and mysterious you are!"
Garnet says: "*chuckles* Hah, mysterious."
Steven says: "Hmm..."
Steven says: "*ponders for a while* I know!"
Steven says: "I'll throw a little party on the beach in front of the temple!"
Steven says: "Just us and the Pizzas."
Amethyst says: "I don't know, Steven."
Steven says: "Don't worry!"
Steven says: "I'll take care of everything!"
Trans. Ext. Crystal Temple.
Steven has a table and chairs set on the beach. He is also cooking hot dogs and hamburgers on a barbecue grill.
Steven says: "Man, this is gonna be so good."
Amethyst says: "Hey, Steven."
Steven says: "Hey!"
Pearl says: "Got everything ready for your little party?"
Steven says: "Yeah, and there's one more thing."
Amethyst says: "What's this for?"
Steven says: "I was thinking you guys could change your outfits."
Pearl says: "What's wrong with what we have on now?"
Steven says: "Nothing."
Steven says: "I just thought it would be nice to go kinda casual."
The Pizza family begins to arrive around the cliff.
Nanefua says: "Is this the right address?"
Jenny says: "I've never seen this side of the beach before."
Steven says: "Oh man, they're here!"
Steven says: "Hurry up and change."
Steven says: "Over here everyone!"
Steven says: "*runs towards the Pizza family* Hi!"
Jenny says: "Hey, Steven!"
Kiki says: "Hey, Steven!"
Nanefua says: "Hello."
Steven says: "How are you all doing today?"
Kofi says: "The shop is closed today, because it's broken!"
Steven says: "*sweating* Oh!"
Steven says: "Uh..."
Steven says: "that sounds, uh..."
Nanefua says: "Hey!"
Nanefua says: "Do I smell hot dogs?"
Nanefua says: "Show me where the hot dogs are."
Steven says: "Oh, right this way, everyone."
Steven says: "*leads them toward the Gems* First, let me introduce—"
Garnet says: "We Are the Crystal Gems!"
Garnet says: "Garnet!"
Amethyst says: "Amethyst!"
Pearl says: "Pearl!"
Steven says: "*pops in* And Steven!"
Steven says: "But you already knew my name..."
Nanefua says: "Oh, you're all so talented."
Kofi says: "So, you are a circus act."
Pearl says: "Circus act?"
Steven says: "*barges in* Hey, let's eat!"
The Crystal Gems and the Pizza family begin eating around the party table.
Kiki says: "Everything came out great!"
Steven says: "Thanks, Kiki."
Nanefua says: "Aren't you girls hungry?"
Nanefua says: "You've barely touched your food."
Garnet says: "We don't need to eat."
Nanefua says: "Oh, you young people and your experimental diets."
Garnet says: "I am much older than you."
Kofi says: "So, you all live in that tiny house up on that hill?"
Garnet says: "*waves her hand as it sparkles in the air* We inhabit the inner sanctums, only accessible through magical extra dimensional doors."
Kofi says: "What is wrong with your hand?"
Jenny says: "And why does this place look like it's falling apart?"
Pearl says: "Well, the temple has been here for thousands of years—"
Kofi says: "Oh!"
Kofi says: "I see how it is, when something breaks around here, you just leave it alone..."
Kofi says: "just like the sign at my shop!"
Steven says: "Um..."
Steven says: "*sweating profusely* Who wants to play volleyball?"
Steven draws the outline of the volleyball court on the sand with a stick.
Steven says: "Okay, everyone, the court is all set."
Steven says: "Now to get into our teams."
Pearl says: "But, Steven, won't our abilities give us an unfair advantage?"
Steven says: "That's why I'm picking the teams."
Steven says: "Amethyst and Jenny!"
Steven says: "Pearl and Kiki!"
Steven says: "Garnet and Kofi!"
Steven says: "And last, but not least, yours truly and Nanefua!"
Nanefua says: "I haven't played in ages but I bet I could whoop all your butts."
Steven says: "That's the spirit."
Steven says: "You guys ready?"
Steven says: "Let's play!"
Steven throws the volleyball into the air and the first match begins. Amethyst gets the first serve.
Amethyst says: "Oh-ho!"
Amethyst says: "Hope you're ready to lose, Pearl."
Pearl says: "There is no way I'd lose to someone like you!"
Amethyst says: "Here we come!"
Kiki says: "Uh..."
Kiki says: "hah!"
Pearl says: "Nice one, Kiki!"
Kiki says: "Aaand..."
Kiki says: "pow!"
Kiki smacks the volleyball down. Amethyst and Jenny miss it.
Steven says: "Amethyst!"
Steven says: "No kicking!"
Amethyst says: "What kind of game is this?"
Pearl says: "Nicely done, Kiki!"
Steven says: "Try and stick to the rules, Amethyst!"
Nanefua says: "Try harder, Jenny!"
Kiki says: "Here it comes!"
Jenny pulls back the net and uses it to deflect the ball into the air.
Kiki says: "Come on, Jenny!"
Jenny says: "What?"
Jenny says: "I'm not doing anything."
Amethyst says: "My move!"
Jenny says: "Aw, yes!"
Pearl says: "That was uncalled for, Amethyst!"
Jenny says: "You afraid of getting a little sand in your hair, Kiki?"
Kiki says: "No, just trying to keep tidy."
Pearl says: "There's nothing wrong with trying to keep tidy."
Nanefua says: "So exciting!"
Steven says: "Yeah!"
Kofi says: "Our turn."
Garnet says: "I'm ready."
Jenny says: "I got this one."
Kofi says: "Jennifer!"
Kofi says: "You touch that ball, you're grounded!"
Jenny says: "Whoa!"
Jenny says: "*dodges the ball* Daddy, you cheatin'!"
Kofi says: "HA-HA-HA!"
Kofi says: "The look on your face!"
Kofi says: "Hahaha!"
Garnet says: "This is going to be easy."
Nanefua says: "It'd be nice if they stuck to the basics."
Amethyst says: "Take this, Garnet!"
Amethyst says: "Yeeeee-ha!"
Garnet says: "*jumps up into the air* Haaaghh!"
Garnet says: "Ah!"
The ball comes charging at full speed towards Amethyst and Jenny.
Jenny says: "We should probably move, huh?"
Amethyst says: "Yeah..."
Amethyst says: "we should."
Both Amethyst and Jenny move away from the volleyball court, just as the ball hits the sand like a meteor, forming glass on its impact.
Kofi says: "Hahaha!"
Kofi says: "You're all running like wild chickens!"
Kofi says: "Hahahaha!"
Amethyst says: "*looking at the glass formation* Woaaaaah!"
Jenny says: "*looking at the glass formation* Woaaaaah!"
Nanefua says: "Did you know that when sand is super heated it turns into glass?"
Steven says: "I did not know that."
Amethyst says: "*grabs the glass formation and tosses it into the ocean in rage* Let's play!"
The Gems and the Pizzas continue playing volleyball with each other.
Pearl says: "*sees Amethyst kicking the ball* Amethyst!"
Pearl says: "*proceeds to summon five Holo-Pearls* Aahhh..."
Pearl says: "*runs around Kiki with the Holo-Pearls* Over here, Amethyst!"
Pearl says: "Over here!"
Kofi says: "Kofi time!"
Jenny says: "Jenny time!"
Kofi says: "You can't use the car for a month!"
Jenny says: "*misses the ball* Daddy!"
Amethyst says: "Why you cheatin' so much?"
Garnet says: "You cheated first."
Jenny says: "That is not true."
The Gems and the Pizzas start arguing in the background.
Nanefua says: "This is getting out of hand."
Steven says: "*sigh* I'll run and get the ball."
Steven says: "Ah, no!"
Steven says: "It's back!"
Steven says: "Pufferfish monster's back!"
Nanefua says: "What's all the—"
Steven says: "Nanefua!"
Steven says: "Ruuuunnn!!!"
The Gems and the Pizzas are still arguing, oblivious to the strong wind blowing.
Amethyst says: "We should win 'cause we're the best."
Kiki says: "Y'all cheated!"
Garnet says: "You are lying."
Pearl says: "Cheaters!"
Kofi says: "Everyone is grounded here!"
Steven says: "*running away with Nanafua* Garrneeeet!"
Garnet says: "Steven!"
Garnet says: "Oh, no!"
Garnet says: "Gems!"
Garnet says: "Protect the Pizzas!"
Kofi says: "Hey!"
Kofi says: "?"
Kofi says: "What is going on!"
Kofi says: "?"
Steven says: "This is terrible."
Steven says: "I was trying to get everyone together, but now everyone's in danger."
Nanefua says: "I'm not afraid of that thing!"
Nanefua says: "Let's see if you can keep up with me!"
Steven says: "Of course I can!"
Nanefua says: "Oh!"
Nanefua says: "Oh!"
Nanefua says: "Over here!"
Steven says: "No!"
Steven says: "Over here!"
Steven says: "Come on!"
Nanefua and Steven starts running in circles around the monster and distracting it.
Pearl says: "Oh my gosh!"
Pearl says: "Steven!"
Kiki says: "What are they doing?"
Steven says: "Everybody!"
Steven says: "Get ready!"
Kofi says: "Mom, you are crazy!"
Garnet says: "Not crazy..."
Garnet says: "Brave."
Jenny says: "Gunga!"
Jenny says: "Careful with your back!"
Steven says: "Amethyst!"
Steven says: "Turn yourself into a ball!"
Amethyst says: "Okay!"
Nanefua says: "Jenny!"
Nanefua says: "Roll Amethyst to the net and then hold on!"
Jenny says: "Sure thing!"
Nanefua says: "Pearl!"
Nanefua says: "Head over to Jenny and Amethyst!"
Pearl says: "Yes, ma'am!"
Nanefua says: "Hit Amethyst into the air as hard as you can!"
Pearl says: "*cracks knuckles* With pleasure."
Pearl says: "*tosses Amethyst into the air and whacks her high into the sky* Hu-uh!!"
Nanefua says: "Kofi!"
Nanefua says: "Kiki!"
Nanefua says: "Get over to the net!"
Steven says: "Garnet, spike the beach!"
Garnet says: "I understand!"
Amethyst says: "*gets caught by Garnet* Be gentle."
Garnet says: "I'll try!"
Garnet smacks Amethyst hard. Amethyst grunts as she plunges towards the ground like a meteor, gradually setting aflame. She then makes impact on the sand, creating a huge spiky formation of glass.
Nanefua says: "Here comes the tricky part!"
Steven says: "I'm ready!"
Steven and Nanafua runs towards the volleyball court and the pufferfish monster gives chase.
Nanefua says: "Everyone take the net to the other side of the court!"
Steven says: "Okay, everyone, pull the net into its face!"
Everyone starts pushing against the wind and shoving the monster into the glass spikes with the net.
Nanefua says: "It's not enough!"
Steven says: "Don't worry, here comes Garnet!"
Garnet dives from the sky towards the monster and punches it into the glass spikes. A cloud of sand then envelops the screen. A period of time passes by.
Kofi says: "Thanks for your hospitality."
Nanefua says: "*lightly jabs Kofi in the stomach* And?"
Kofi says: "And, for saving my family, you are all officially un-banned from my shop."
Steven says: "Aw, thank you so much, Kofi!"
Steven says: "We really appreciate it, right, guys?"
Garnet says: "Okay, yes, thanks."
Steven says: "Aaaand?"
Pearl says: "What were we banned from again?"
Steven laughs nervously as the star iris zooms in on his face, ending the episode.
END.
