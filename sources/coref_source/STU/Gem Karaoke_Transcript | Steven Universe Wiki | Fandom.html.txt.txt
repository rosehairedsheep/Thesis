Open Int. Beach House.
Connie is holding a camera and facing it towards Steven and the Gems on the couch.
Connie says: "I'm recording."
Steven says: "Thanks Connie!"
Steven says: "*reading a song list* Okay, it's 5-6-3-8-3."
Pearl says: "*typing on a tablet* 5, 6, 3, 8, 3."
Amethyst says: "Come on."
Amethyst says: "Play the song, P."
Amethyst says: "I can't waits no mores."
Pearl says: "Amethyst, I'm trying."
Pearl says: "Steven, are you sure that's the right number?"
Pearl says: "I keep typing it in, but it doesn't seem to be playing."
Steven says: "Oh, you need to hit "Start"."
Pearl says: "Ahh..."
Pearl says: "I see."
An instrumental version of "Haven't You Noticed I'm a Star" begins playing on the TV.
Steven says: "Yes!"
Steven says: "*picks up a microphone* Connie, the song's starting!"
Connie says: "Actually, you guys just go on ahead."
Steven says: "Are you sure?"
Connie says: "It's fine."
Connie says: "Someone's gotta hold the camera, right?"
Steven says: "Oh."
Steven says: "All right."
Steven says: "♪ I can't help it if I make a scene, ♪ Stepping out of my hot pink limousine."
Amethyst says: "Yeah, boi!"
Pearls picks up a tambourine and begins playing.
Steven says: "♪ I'm turning heads and I'm stopping traffic, ♪ When I pose, they scream, and when I joke, they laugh."
Amethyst grabs another microphone, kicks the items on the table off and jumps on top, shocking Pearl.
Pearl says: "*chuckles* Oh, Amethyst."
Garnet grabs the microphone from Amethyst.
Pearl grabs the microphone from Steven.
Pearl says: "♪ Everybody needs a friend, ♪ And I've got you and you and you."
Pearl says: "♪ So many, I can't even name them, ♪ Can you blame me?"
Pearl says: "I'm too famous."
Steven says: "Connie?"
Connie turns the camera towards Steven, who is standing next to her.
Steven says: "Connie, come on!"
Steven says: "The best part's coming up."
Connie says: "Oh, it's fine, you guys are already doing a great job."
Steven says: "Come on, it's your turn."
Connie says: "Are you sure?"
Steven says: "Yeah, go on."
Steven says: "Have fun!"
Connie says: "Ok!"
Steven turns over the camera while Garnet hands Connie the microphone.
Connie says: "Thanks, Garnet!"
Connie says: "♪ Haven't you noticed that I'm a star?"
Connie says: "♪ I'm coming into view as the world is turning."
Connie says: "♪ Haven't you noticed I made it this far?"
Connie says: "♪ Now, everyone can see me burning."
Connie poses dramatically on the table as she sings, and Steven turns the camera around to capture himself, Connie, and the Gems.
Everyone says: "♪ Now, everyone can see me burning."
Everyone says: "♪ Now, everyone can see me burning."
Everyone starts cheering and laughing together.
Pearl says: "Connie, what a finale!"
Connie says: "*blushes* Thanks, Pearl!"
Amethyst says: "You're a karaoke beast!"
Connie says: "Aww, thanks you guys."
Just then, the song starts to play again.
Amethyst says: "Uh, Pearl?"
Amethyst says: "How many times did you enter the song number before hitting "Start"?"
Pearl says: "Probably about 15 times?"
Connie says: "Encore!"
Steven says: "Yeah!"
END.
