Well... I suppose it's still a mess. It's been so fun playing, but now we have to clean, which is also fun! Are you ready to tidy up?
Onion is shown throwing up a piece of broccoli out of his mouth.
Rainbow 2.0.
Oh, Onion, don't be that way. Your best friend Rainbow will help you tidy up. While taking out Rainbow Quartz 2.0's Parasol Let's get things a little bit more animated in here!
Onion's toys start moving. Rainbow Quartz 2.0 starts singing "The Tidying Song".

Rainbow 2.0.
Okay, I'm gonna need like... 5 minutes.
Pearl and Steven unfuse.
Garnet says: "Steven, you're late."
Garnet says: "I need you for the Sunstone Safety Geminar."
Steven says: "Oh, no, that was today?"
Steven says: "But Rainbow Quartz promised to hang out with Onion today."
Garnet says: "Don't worry."
Garnet says: "I'll handle the Geminar."
Garnet says: "I'll explain to them every possible future where they get hurt in this house."
Steven says: "I don't know if that's a good idea."
Steven says: "I'll be right there."
Steven says: "Pearl, I'll be back as soon as I can."
Steven says: "Will you hang out with Onion while I'm gone?"
Pearl says: "Of course."
Pearl says: "He's been a dream for Rainbow."
Pearl says: "I can take things from here."
Steven says: "Are you sure?"
Pearl says: "I'm sure it'll be fine."
Pearl says: "Oh, look at him now, making a collage."
Steven says: "Uhh..."
Garnet says: "Heaven Beetle, Earth Beetle, there's a future where you fall into the garbage disposal and nobody notices until it's too late."
Steven says: "I gotta go, but I'll be back as soon as I can."
Pearl says: "Take your time."
Pearl says: "We'll be fine here."
Pearl says: "*gasp* wow, Onion, that's a beautiful bag of hair."
Pearl says: "Whose is it?"
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Ocean Jasper says: "I slip on the stairs?"
Garnet says: "Yes."
Garnet says: "You shatter on impact."
Ocean JasperNephrite says: "AAAH!!!"
Steven says: "Garnet, I'm here."
Garnet says: "Steven, help."
Garnet says: "I think I'm scaring them."
Heaven and Earth Beetle sound scared.
Steven says: "It's okay."
Steven says: "We got this."
Steven says: "Let's get this safety Geminar started with a very special guest speaker."
Steven and Garnet dance and fuse into Sunstone.
Sunstone says: "Your rockin' pal Sunstone's here to shine."
Ocean Jasper says: "Watch out, Sunstone."
Ocean Jasper says: "It's dangerous in here."
Sunstone says: "Not if you practice home safety."
Sunstone says: "Don't slip up."
Sunstone says: "Clear objects off the stairs."
Sunstone says: "*picks up a water bottle* Foul shot!"
Sunstone says: "*tosses bottle in trash* Make sure you cover your trash, or you might attract wild animals."
Sunstone says: "Come on."
Sunstone says: "Let's go!"
Sunstone says: "Don't leave the water running."
Sunstone says: "It could flood your house!"
Sunstone says: "Put protective covers on electrical outlets, especially when kids are around."
Sunstone says: "And, most importantly, turn off motion smoothing on your TV."
Ocean Jasper says: "Wow, everything looks so much better."
Steven's Phone starts ringing.
Sunstone says: "Alright, hold tight."
Sunstone says: "I gotta take a phone call."
Sunstone says: "In the meantime, check out this commercial."
Steven warps into Little Homeworld in Bluebird.
Steven says: ""Hey, all you Gems out there in the universe!"
Steven says: "Have you been feeling lost and confused in this new era?"
Steven says: "Then come on down to Little Homeschool!"
Garnet and Steven unfuse.
Steven says: "Hey, Pearl."
Steven says: "How's it going?"
Pearl says: "Hi, Steven."
Pearl says: "*chuckles nervously* Just wondering if you're coming back soon."
Steven says: "Is everything alright over there?"
Pearl says: "Well, just as soon as you left, Onion got a little..."
Pearl says: "frustrated."
Pearl says: "He's really doing a number on the house."
Pearl says: "I think he misses Rainbow."
Steven says: "Aah, I'll be right there."
Trans. Int. Onion's House.
Pearl and Steven fuse.
Rainbow 2.0.
Rainbow is back! Now, now, Onion, we do not go about hitting things, alright? My, did all that havoc make you sleepy? Why don't we take a little nap?
Rainbow sends Onion up the stairs.
Rainbow 2.0.
And off we go! Rest well.
Immediately, Onion goes down the stairs. Rainbow sends Onion up the stairs again.
Rainbow 2.0.
Off we go again!
Onion goes down the stairs again. Rainbow sends Onion up the stairs again. Onion, again, goes down the stairs.
Rainbow 2.0.
While sending Onion up the stairs. Alright, Onion. Last one... Oh, dear... I wonder how Garnet is doing.
Trans. Beach House.
Steven says: "Garnet, I'm back!"
Steven opens the door, revealing the Beach House destroyed inside.
Steven says: "What happened?"
Garnet says: "Hey, Steven."
Garnet says: "We set up a home safety obstacle course, but then, we got distracted."
Steven says: "*gasps* Motion smoothing???"
Garnet says: "It's great for football."
Steven says: "Everybody out of the house!"
Trans. Beach City.
Sunstone says: "Alright!"
Sunstone says: "Change of scenery!"
Sunstone says: "You guys wanna see something cool?"
Sunstone says: "The cool thing is that I'm wearing..."
Sunstone says: "a helmet."
Sunstone says: "*inspires the observers to follow suit and skate* Now you're getting it."
Onto the road.
Sunstone says: "Alright, next lesson."
Sunstone says: "Woah, hold up!"
Sunstone says: "*car nearly hits them* You know what's also cool?"
Sunstone says: "Respect."
Sunstone says: "Respecting crosswalk signals that is."
Sunstone and the Gems wait.
Sunstone says: "You're doing great."
The Gems cross the road as the walk light turns green. Steven's phone starts ringing. Garnet and Steven unfuse.
Steven says: "*exhausted* Please."
Steven says: "Please have everything under control."
Pearl says: "STEVEN, EVERYTHING'S OUT OF CONTROL!"
Steven says: "Yup."
Pearl says: "It's getting really weird here."
Pearl says: "Steven, you were never like this."
Pearl says: "You were such a good kid."
Pearl says: "I'm so sorry I never told you that- *drops phone* AAH!"
Pearl says: "I-I can hear him, but I can't see him."
Pearl says: "I think he's in the walls."
Pearl says: "I don't know how he got there, and I don't know how to get him out!"
Steven says: "*gasps* Garnet, can you handle things on your own for a little bit?"
Garnet says: "No problem."
Garnet says: "Our students love me."
Garnet says: "*walks over to them* Let me tell you all the ways you can get hit by a car."
Steven says: "Agh, Garnet, forget it."
Steven says: "I'll stay."
Steven's phone starts ringing.
Pearl says: "STEVEN, THERE'S A SNAKE!"
Steven says: "Never mind!"
Trans. Onion's house.
Steven says: "Hello?"
Pearl appears between the stair railing.
Pearl says: "STEVEN!!!!!"
Steven says: "Ahh!"
Steven says: "Pearl!"
Pearl says: "It's not safe here!"
Pearl says: "HIDE!"
Steven says: "Pearl, you got to chill out."
Steven looks ahead as an open jar of mayo is rolled onto the ground into sight. He walks towards the kitchen.
Pearl says: "Steven, no, the danger!"
Pearl says: "*falls on the ground* Oof!"
Steven and Pearl walk into the kitchen with the lights off and they look around, finally seeing Onion with glowing eyes.
Pearl says: "*screams loudly* That's it!"
Steven calmly turns on the light in the kitchen.
Pearl says: "Oh."
Pearl says: "What?"
Steven says: "Aw, I guess he really wants Rainbow, and cookies."
Steven says: "*sees Onion with a jar of cookies on top of the fridge* Wait, is he going to jump?"
Steven says: "Onion, don't you do it."
Steven says: "ONION!"
Steven says: "It's okay, I'll catch you, Onion!"
Steven says: "Okay, th-th-that's fine, too."
Pearl says: "Ooh, are you going to share some with me?"
Onion breaks the cookie jar.
Steven says: "Nope!"
Pearl says: "Nope!"
Steven and Pearl fuse in the background.
Rainbow 2.0.
Come here, you naughty dumpling. Gotcha! Why play with sharp objects when you can play with my sharp wit? Crack jokes, not cookie jars, as I always say. Ha ha! But I'll tell you what isn't a joke- this horrendous mess. Now, this just won't do. *uses umbrella to magically clean up the mess* Phew! You are quite the handful, my boy, *laughs* literally!
Trans. Outside Onion's house.
Rainbow 2.0.
Okay, you're coming with me.
Garnet says: "It's important to keep in mind that all these horrible things did happen to you in alternate timelines."
Garnet says: "Safety is fun."
Rainbow 2.0.
Hey, Garnet, how's about taking another student? I'm feeling a little bit...
Rainbow Quartz makes a silly face and blows a raspberry. Pearl and Steven unfuse.
Garnet says: "You shouldn't have brought him here, Steven."
Steven says: "No, no, no, it's fine."
Steven says: "I-It's good."
Steven says: "No one needs safety training more than Onion."
Steven says: "*exhausted* I'm combining all my responsibilities into one responsibility."
Steven says: "It's brilliant."
Steven says: "It's- It's brilliant."
Steven says: "It's fine."
Steven says: "I'm fine."
Steven says: "Really, it's fine."
Steven says: "It's fine."
Steven says: "I'm fine..."
Onion picks up a piece of grass and makes it whistle. This interests the Gem class to follow Onion around.
Steven says: "I'm fine..."
Steven says: "I'm fine..."
Steven says: "Really, just fine-..."
Steven says: "Huh..."
Steven says: "?"
Steven and others chase the class and Onion until they reach a hill. Onion throws the leaf into the wind. As if hypnotized, the class Gems walk off the cliff and fall.
Pearl says: "Oh no!"
Garnet says: "Steven, quick, Sunstone can save them."
Steven says: "Okay."
Sunstone says: "Oh yeah!"
Pearl says: "No!"
Pearl says: "Let Rainbow save them."
Rainbow 2.0.
I'll catch them with this.
Amethyst says: "Hey, wait!"
Amethyst says: "I need Steven."
Steven says: "What is it, Amethyst?"
Amethyst says: "I just missed you, man!"
Amethyst says: "I haven't seen you for, like, 11 minutes!"
Pearl says: "STEVEN!"
Steven says: "I shouldn't have overbooked my schedule."
Garnet says: "..."
Garnet says: "Noooooo!"
But it turns out to be a public service announcement by Sunstone this whole time.
Sunstone says: "Hey, kids, don't let this happen to you."
Sunstone says: "Always try to manage your time wisely."
Sunstone says: "You can't be everywhere at once."
Sunstone says: "Don't pull a Steven, am I right?"
Sunstone says: "Speaking of which, hey, shouldn't you kids be at your guitar lessons?"
Ocean Jasper says: "But we don't have any g- *gasps* Wowzers!"
Ocean Jasper says: "Thanks, Sunstone!"
Sunstone says: "No problem, dude."
Sunstone says: "It's cool to want to help people, but it's also cool to just say you're too busy."
Pearl says: "Who are you talking to?"
Pearl says: "- *volleyball hits her in the head* OW!"
Sunstone says: "And most importantly, never jump off a cliff, unless you're a trained professional, that is!"
