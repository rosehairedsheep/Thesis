Open Int. Beach House.
Steven is seen standing before the painting of Rose Quartz on the stairs.
Steven says: "All right, Mom."
Steven says: "Where should you go?"
Steven takes the painting off the wall and hangs it above the Temple Gate.
Steven says: "Yeah!"
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "Hmm."
Steven puts the painting inside his conservatory next, leaning onto a potted plant.
Steven says: "How about..."
Steven says: "Here?"
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "Hmm."
Steven warps to the Temple Hand next and tries to see where he could place the painting.
Steven says: "Ughh..."
Steven continues trying out different places to put the painting, such as his bed, outside on the Beach house, his bathroom and finally, back to its original placement.
Steven says: "Perfect."
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "Ugh!"
Steven scratches his head in frustration, when Greg and Amethyst enter the house.
Greg says: "Yo, Schtu-ball!"
Greg says: "Still looking for a place to hang that painting of your mom?"
Steven says: "*sighs* Yeah."
Steven says: "After everything that's happened, I don't know if I still want her hanging over us, you know?"
Amethyst says: "I'm telling you, man, it's not the placement."
Amethyst says: "It's the frame."
Just then, the environment gradually gets darker and darker.
Greg says: "Is it me, or is it getting kinda ominous outside?"
Greg says: "Woah!"
Amethyst says: "Woah!"
Steven says: "Oh-ho ho!"
Steven says: "Hey!"
Steven, Greg and Amethyst run outside to the porch to find the Human Zoo has made its way to Earth.
Trans. Int. Steven Conservatory.
Steven enters his conservatory to make contact with the Zoomans on his Diamond control panel.
Wy-Six says: "Ste-van!"
Wy-Six says: "Greetings!"
Steven says: "Jay-Ten, Wy-Six, how'd you get your space station all the way here?"
Wy-Six says: "We took the Zoo ship and made it a cruise ship."
Greg and Amethyst walk into the room.
Greg says: "Oh hey, Jay-Ten..."
Greg says: "Wy-Six..."
Greg says: "I haven't seen y'all since the Choosening."
Wy-Six says: "You mean since you didn't choosen us?"
Jay-Ten turns a cold shoulder to Greg and walks away.
Wy-Six says: "Don't you have some sound discs to listen to in your wheeled conveyance?"
Greg says: "Y-Yes, I do..."
Greg backs away slowly, as Wy-Six glares at him with a pouty face.
Wy-Six says: "Now that he is gone, we'd love it if you came by for a visit."
Steven says: "Sure thing."
Steven says: "I-Is it ok if Amethyst comes by to say hi to the Famethyst?"
Wy-Six says: "As long as she is not Ga-reg, she's welcome."
Trans. Int. Human Zoo.
Steven and Amethyst enter the Human Zoo, which has gotten a huge overhaul. The Famethyst and Zoomans are seen chilling out and enjoying life together.
Wy-Six says: "Ste-van, welcome to our ca-ruise!"
Steven says: "Wy-Six, it's so different here!"
Wy-Six says: "Humans have control of the ship now, while the Amethysts laze about like delinquents all day."
Wy-Six says: "Did I say that right, Holly Blue?"
Wy-Six turns to Holly Blue Agate, who is seen yelling at an Amethyst, who is ignoring her while relaxing.
Holly Blue says: "Stop relaxing and get back to your posts!"
Holly Blue says: "Ugh!"
Holly Blue says: "How can you stand this total lack of order?"
An Amethyst says: "Chill out, Holly Blue."
An Amethyst says: "You know you want to."
Holly Blue says: "I give up."
Holly Blue says: "No one answers to me, and I answer to no one."
Holly Blue says: "I'd give anything for an order from the Diamonds, but all they talk about is "Steven, Steven, Steven-" Steven!"
Steven says: "Hi, Holly!"
Steven says: "Bye, Holly."
Holly Blue Agate runs away, still blushing in embarrassment, as the Famethyst laugh at her.
Amethyst says: "YO!"
The Famethyst says: "Amethyst!"
Amethyst charges up a spin-dash and rolls straight into the Famethyst, crashing into them like bowling pins and knocking them over.
The Famethyst says: "We missed you!"
The Famethyst says: "Aw, yeah!"
Amethyst and the Famethyst laugh together in joy, while a happy Steven watches.
Wy-Six says: "Ste-van, I have some special friends who wish to meet you."
Wy-Six says: "Isn't that wonderful?"
Wy-Six leads Steven out of the Zoo and they begin walking through a tunnel hallway.
Steven says: "They want to meet me?"
Wy-Six says: "Yes."
Wy-Six says: "It was they who wanted us to visit Earth."
Wy-Six leads Steven to the door leading into Rose Quartz Bubble Room.
Wy-Six says: "I cannot wait to see the look upon your face when you see their faces."
Wy-Six opens the door, revealing "Shy" Rose Quartz standing at the doorway. Steven's face tenses in shock by the sheer and striking appearance of the Rose Quartz to his mom.
Wy-Six says: "Yes!"
Wy-Six says: "This is the look I wished to see!"
Steven says: "So..."
Steven says: "many..."
Steven says: "Rose Quartzes..."
Steven says: "?"
In the room, many Rose Quartzes, now unbubbled and free, are seen relaxing and enjoying in their own recreation too, as the door shuts behind the three Rose Quartzes.
"Superfan" Rose says: "Oh, now that it's Era 3, we were all unbubbled, so now, we're making up for lost time."
"Superfan" Rose says: "Hi!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "I'm Rose Quartz!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "*shakes Steven's hand* And you, you're Steven!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "*lifts him up* You are so much smaller than I imagined!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "Is it because you're half organic?"
"Superfan" Rose says: "Can you believe it, Rose Quartz!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "?"
"Hippie" Rose says: "It's like, we were bubbled, but now we're like, not bubbled."
Steven says: "Th- It's really- It's really great."
"Superfan" Rose says: "Oh, isn't Steven wonderful?"
"Superfan" Rose says: "He's just so supportive and kind and handsome and athletic and smart, and we haven't seen the Earth since we emerged, so what's it like, Steven?"
Steven says: "Huh?"
Steven says: "What?"
"Superfan" Rose says: "The Earth!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "We haven't seen the surface in forever."
"Superfan" Rose says: "*puts Steven down on the ground* What's a typical day like for the legend?"
Steven says: "Uh, most days, I'm pretty busy."
"Hippie" Rose says: "What's your house like?"
Steven says: "Uhh..."
Steven says: "It's nice."
Steven says: "It's next to the ocean."
"Superfan" Rose says: "I've never seen the ocean!"
"Hippie" Rose says: "I've never smelled the ocean."
"Superfan" Rose says: "What's it like breathing?"
Steven says: "It's mostly nitrogen."
"Hippie" Rose says: "I bet you sleep all the time."
Steven says: "Huh..."
Steven says: "not all the time."
"Superfan" Rose says: "What's it like eating food?"
Steven says: "Wh-Wh-Why don't you come to dinner and find out?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "?"
Steven chuckles as he looks at "Shy" Rose in unease.
Steven says: "I mean.."
Steven says: "if-if you want dinner?"
At that moment, the Famethyst parade past in a conga line, chanting "Da-da da-da da... DA!" on repeat.
Amethyst says: "Yo, Steven!"
Amethyst's face instantly tenses up in shock too, upon seeing the Rose Quartzes beside Steven.
Steven says: "F-Family reunion..."
Steven says: "!"
Amethyst continues staring in shock, as she and the Famethyst parade away.
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Back home, Steven eats his dinner while the three Rose Quartzes, Garnet and Pearl watch on.
"Superfan" Rose says: "He's cutting one of those carrot beans again."
"Superfan" Rose says: "Going..."
"Superfan" Rose says: "up..."
"Superfan" Rose says: "to..."
"Superfan" Rose says: "his..."
"Superfan" Rose says: "mouth!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "Ah, and it's gone!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "Wow!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "No one can eat a carrot bean like you."
Steven says: "I've been doing this for 16 years, now."
Greg says: "Hey, Schtu-ball."
Greg says: "*enters the house, dejected* Any idea how long the Zoomans are going to be around?"
"Superfan" Rose says: "Hi!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "How are you?"
Greg halts in his track upon seeing the Rose Quartzes, as Pearl gives him an unassuring shrug.
Greg says: "I can feel the rest of my hair falling out."
Steven says: "Dad, wait."
Steven says: "You want to join us for dinner?"
Greg says: "Nope!"
Without hesitation, Greg runs out of the house, leaving Steven in slight dejection.
Steven says: "Uh..."
"Superfan" Rose says: "All right!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "Back to this eating thing."
"Superfan" Rose says: "*takes Steven's plate* So, you take this food stuff, and you put it in your face hole like this!"
Steven says: "Yeah, you got it."
Pearl looks down at the table in discomfort, when "Hippie" Rose begins talking to her.
"Hippie" Rose says: "You know, if I could have had a Pearl, I would've wanted her to be just like you."
"Hippie" Rose says: "Have you tried this "butter" stuff?"
Pearl says: "Oh, it's okay, but thank you, Ro-o-o-ose..."
"Shy" Rose says: "Excuse me, Pearl."
"Shy" Rose says: "Are you feeling okay?"
Pearl says: "*sighs* I'm going to the bathroom!"
Pearl gets off from the table and walks towards Steven's Bathroom. "Hippie" Rose then turns her attention to Garnet.
"Hippie" Rose says: "Hey, you're looking kind of tense."
"Hippie" Rose says: "How about I give you a nice, relaxing massage while we talk?"
Garnet says: "I'm also going to the bathroom."
"Superfan" Rose says: "Okay, Steven."
"Superfan" Rose says: "I totally got this eating thing down!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "Here, open your face hole."
"Superfan" Rose says: "*feeds Steven a carrot* Oh, wow!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "Good job!"
Steven says: "Mmm, thank you."
Steven says: "I should, uh, probably see how they're doing in there."
"Superfan" Rose says: "We'll come with you!"
Steven says: "Uh, that's- that's okay."
Steven says: "You guys wait here."
Steven says: "I'll be right back."
"Hippie" Rose says: "Let's check it out when they're done."
Steven says: "*holds onto the bathroom door handle* They're not her."
Steven says: "It's not weird."
Trans. Int. Steven's Bathroom.
Steven opens the bathroom door and enters.
Steven says: "How are you guys doing?"
Pearl says: "Steven, isn't this super weird!"
Pearl says: "?"
Garnet says: "Pearl..."
Garnet says: "Of course it's super weird!"
Steven says: "*closes the door behind him* Come on, we can't be like this."
Steven says: "They were bubbled just because they look like Mom."
Steven says: "Now, they're finally free, and we're ditching them to whisper in the bathroom for the same reason?"
Garnet says: "I know it's wrong, but..."
Garnet says: "I'm overwhelmed."
Pearl says: "They don't just look like her, they are like her."
Pearl says: "She made them."
Pearl says: "I thought I'd be more ready for this..."
Steven says: "Okay, fine, stay here."
Steven says: "But I'm going back out there to make sure they have a good time."
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Steven exits the bathroom, sighing, and bumps into "Superfan" Rose unexpectedly, who grabs his hands and twirls him around.
"Superfan" Rose says: "*squealing* Hello, Steven!"
Steven says: "*chuckling nervously* Sorry, you surprised me."
Steven says: "But it- it's fine."
Steven back away, only to bumps into "Shy" Rose behind him. "Shy" Rose then notices the painting of Rose Quartz by the stairs, and seems to understand.
"Shy" Rose says: "Maybe, we should get back."
"Shy" Rose says: "We don't want to wear out our welcome."
"Hippie" Rose says: "But we're having so much fun."
"Superfan" Rose says: "Do you not want us here?"
Steven says: "What?"
Steven says: "No!"
Steven says: "Yo-you're totally welcome here."
Steven says: "You- You should..."
Steven says: "stay over!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "For the night?"
Steven says: "Mmm..."
Steven says: "*reluctantly* Slumber party!"
Steven says: "We should have an Earth-style slumber party!"
"Hippie" Rose says: "Cool."
"Hippie" Rose says: "What is slumber?"
"Superfan" Rose says: "This is so great!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "I'm dying!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "I'm dying!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "I am dead!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "I am dead Rose Quartz!"
Steven chuckles nervously at "Superfan" Rose's morbid exaggeration.
Trans. Int. Steven's Room.
It is night-time, Steven and the Rose Quartzes are watching movie on his TV in his bedroom.
"Superfan" Rose says: "Wow, so that's a movie?"
"Superfan" Rose says: "Let's watch another!"
Steven says: "Take your pick."
"Superfan" Rose says: "How about this one?"
"Hippie" Rose says: "This is like, so chill."
Steven says: "*chuckles anxiously* I know, right?"
Rose Quartz TV.
Steven says: "GAAH!"
Rose Quartz TV.
Steven says: "*hastily shuts off the TV* Time for bed!"
Time-Skip.
Steven puts the Rose Quartzes into sleeping bags, zipping "Superfan" Rose's one up to her chin, and turns off the lights.
Steven says: "Is everyone comfortable?"
"Superfan" Rose says: "Yep!"
"Hippie" Rose says: "Me too."
Steven says: "Good!"
Steven says: "I'm also very comfortable."
"Superfan" Rose says: "So, how do you sleep?"
Steven says: "You just lay down, close your eyes, and don't say anything."
"Superfan" Rose says: "It's a shame we're leaving tomorrow."
Steven says: "Yeah, I wish you could just..."
Steven says: "stay here forever..."
Steven says: "!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "Do you mean it?"
"Hippie" Rose says: "Of course, he means it."
"Hippie" Rose says: "Why would he say it if he didn't mean it?"
"Superfan" Rose says: "Then yes!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "The answer is yes!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "We would love to live with you!"
Steven says: "*taken aback* Aah!"
Steven says: "I mean, you c-c-c-could, but then, uhh..."
Steven says: "L-Lion might get mad..."
Steven says: "?"
"Shy" Rose says: "Can't you guys take a hint?"
"Shy" Rose says: "He doesn't want us to be here!"
"Shy" Rose says: "He doesn't like us."
"Hippie" Rose says: "What?"
"Superfan" Rose says: "There's no way that's true, right, Steven- *gasps loudly* Your face!"
Steven says: "*chewing his blanket in anxiety* It's not that I don't like you."
Steven says: "It's- It's j-just..."
"Superfan" Rose says: "Wow, he really does hate us."
"Shy" Rose says: "I'm going back to the ship."
"Shy" Rose says: "*gets up* Sorry for bothering you, Steven."
"Hippie" Rose says: "Man, this is such a bummer."
"Superfan" Rose says: "*sniffles* Never meet your heroes."
Steven says: "Aww..."
Steven says: "Wait!"
Trans. Int. Steven's Conservatory.
"Hippie" Rose says: "Let's get out of here."
"Superfan" Rose says: "I'm trying!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "I-I just got to get this sleepy sack off!"
Steven says: "Wait!"
Steven says: "*runs in* Please, please don't leave like this!"
Steven says: "I- I'm really sorry."
Steven says: "It's not like I don't like you or don't want you here."
Steven says: "It's just that..."
Steven says: "you look so much like her; like my Mom."
Steven says: "I thought I was ready to move on and not have her hanging over me anymore, but I can barely be in a room with you because I still feel all twisted up about her."
Steven says: "I've been pretending that I'm fine because it's not your fault, but..."
Steven says: "I'm not fine..."
"Shy" Rose says: "We've been pretending, too."
Steven says: "Huh?"
"Shy" Rose says: "To be fine."
"Superfan" Rose says: "We're not pretending!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "We're having so much fun!"
"Hippie" Rose says: "Come on, let's give it a rest."
"Superfan" Rose says: "Fine..."
"Shy" Rose says: "Your mom created us, too, and got us all bubbled, just for being Rose Quartzes."
"Hippie" Rose says: "But, you know, it's cool."
"Hippie" Rose says: "It's whatever."
"Shy" Rose says: "It's not whatever."
"Shy" Rose says: "I don't expect you to understand."
"Shy" Rose says: "I swore I wouldn't talk about this."
Steven says: "But I do understand."
Steven says: "Ah, man..."
Steven says: "If anyone can understand how you feel, it's me."
Steven says: "I've been thinking about you guys like my mom times three, but we're really more like siblings."
"Superfan" Rose says: "Siblings?"
"Superfan" Rose says: "What's that?"
Steven says: "Well, Mom created all of us, and we've all been living in her shadow."
Steven says: "*unzips "Superfan" Rose from her sleeping bag* We'll always be related to her, but that means, we'll always be related to each other."
"Superfan" Rose says: "That's pretty awesome!"
"Hippie" Rose says: "I'm so glad we're related."
"Superfan" Rose says: "Yeah!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "Siblings forever!"
Steven says: "So, wait."
Steven says: "Do you all still want to live here?"
"Superfan" Rose says: "Oh gosh, no!"
"Superfan" Rose says: "I don't know why I said that."
Steven says: "Well, feel free to visit if you want."
Steven says: "N-No pressure."
"Shy" Rose says: "Thanks, Steven."
Steven says: "Later, Rose Quartz."
Steven waves goodbye as the three Rose Quartzes warp away in content, just when Amethyst warps back in.
Amethyst says: "Famethyst for life!"
Amethyst says: "What'd I miss?"
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Back home,  Steven sleeps in peace in his bed, while Lion sleeps nearby. The painting of Rose Quartz is now stashed away inside Lion's mane, no longer hanging over everyone's head.
