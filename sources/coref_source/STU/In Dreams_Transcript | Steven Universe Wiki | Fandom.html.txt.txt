Open Ext. Beach City.
Steven enters at Beach City, noticing flashing lights coming from inside his house.
Steven says: "*gasps* All right!"
Steven says: "Now that I've saved the universe..."
Steven says: "I can finally party!"
Steven runs to his house and sees everyone... Rhodonite, Padparadscha, Rutile Twins, Fluorite, and Lars Barriga. Including Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl, and Connie Maheswaran... even Onion. Steven is eager to join the party as he begins to open his door, but it disappears.
Steven says: "Huh?"
Steven says: "*banging* Hey, guys!"
Steven says: "What's the deal?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "Let me in!"
Cookie Cat says: "*deep voice; echos* Steven."
Cookie Cat says: "No one needs your help, so why are you still here?"
Steven says: "What??"
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Steven says: "*gasps; wakes up heavily* Why do I keep having these horrible dreams?"
Steven says: "Peridot?"
Steven opens the door, letting Peridot in.
Peridot says: "STEVEN, STEVEN, STEVEN, STEVEN, STEVEN!!!"
Peridot says: "~ Today is the day!"
Peridot says: "Did you tape it?"
Steven says: "What are you talking about?"
Peridot says: "You promised me!"
Steven says: "Oh, are you talking about the reboot of the classic great northern teen drama Camp Pining Hearts that I recorded..."
Steven says: "on this tape?"
Peridot says: "*gasps* AAAAAH!"
Steven says: "The return of Camp Pining Hearts!"
Peridot says: "The return of Camp Pining Hearts!"
Trans. Int. Steven's Room.
Steven says: "You know, I'm so glad you're here."
Peridot says: "*covers Steven's mouth* Shh!"
Peridot says: "That's great, now press play you monster!"
Camp Pining Hearts song plays. "Starring, Olivia Bouchard, Jasmine", and "Starring, Victor Tourti√©re, Rodrigo".
Rodrigo says: "Oh, Jasmine, I wish you would fly into my arms, *voice fades* but every time..."
Later that day.
Steven says: "*shouting off screen* WHAT HAVE THEY DONE?!"
Peridot says: "*shouting off screen* WHAT HAVE THEY DONE?!"
Steven says: "!"
Peridot says: "!"
Steven says: "?!"
Peridot says: "?!"
Steven says: "!"
Peridot says: "!"
Steven and Peridot appear on screen.
Peridot says: "What is with this Rodrigo guy!"
Peridot says: "?"
Peridot says: "He has no charisma!"
Steven says: "And can we talk about this cinematography?"
Peridot says: "GAHHHH!"
Peridot says: "They've changed all the characters, and I don't care about any of them!"
Peridot says: "*lifts up the television dramatically, slamming it on the ground* How could you do this to me?!"
Peridot says: "!"
Peridot says: "*leaning over the TV, sobbing* Camp Pining Hearts helped me escape when everything around me was in chaos."
Steven says: "CPH brought us together."
Peridot says: "And now..."
Peridot says: "LOOK AT THIS NIGHTMARE!"
Peridot says: "Steven!"
Peridot says: "You didn't tell me that they cast you!"
Steven says: "What?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "They didn't."
Steven says: "I-Is this..."
Steven says: "my dream from last night?"
In television, Steven falls off of his house. The television starts Camp Pining Hearts again.
Steven says: "Whoa!"
Steven says: "My- My powers must be interfering with the TV signal!"
Peridot says: "Steven!"
Peridot says: "Do you know what this means?!"
Peridot says: "!"
Steven says: "I have to start wearing a tinfoil hat?"
Peridot says: "NO!"
Peridot says: "It means that if we can put YOUR dreams on the television, we can reboot the reboot!"
Steven says: "Reboot the- Peridot, you're a genius!"
Peridot says: "I know."
Steven says: "And, well, it might be fun to fix something that isn't the entire universe."
Peridot says: "This is going to be the beginning of Peridot and Steven productions!"
Steven says: "Yeah!"
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Steven says: "So, Peridot, do you think Jasmine's end game is Khaz or Rodrigo?"
Peridot says: "The writers are clearly trying to railroad us into a "Jasdrigo" partnership, but- Gah!"
Peridot says: "These characters have no chemistry!"
Steven says: "Just can't get into Rodrigo, can you?"
Peridot says: "He's SO infuriatingly passive!"
Steven says: "Hey!"
Steven says: "Hey!"
Steven says: "I get that his social anxiety and poutine allergy aren't really connected to the larger story, but maybe if he just had some kind of foil?"
Peridot says: "A foil."
Peridot says: "Interesting."
Steven says: "I got it!"
Steven says: "*drawing* A hunky lifeguard friend with nice muscles and everyone always wants to hang out with him."
Steven says: "Despite the blessing and curse of his popularity, he still makes time to help buddy Rodrigo with his confidence!"
Peridot takes a look at Steven's drawing of "Stefan".
Peridot says: "Bold."
Peridot says: "I like it!"
Peridot says: "Good work, Stefan!"
Trans. Int. Steven's Room at night time.
Peridot says: "..."
Peridot says: "And why are you eating right at bedtime?"
Steven says: "Oh, this chili?"
Steven says: "*gulp* I read that eating spicy foods before bed makes your dreams super vivid."
Peridot says: "Huh, I appreciate your initiative."
Steven says: "Huh, thanks."
Peridot says: "Just don't forget."
Peridot says: "*whispers to Steven's ear* Action-oriented storytelling."
Trans. Int. Camp Pining Hearts.
Stefan says: "Hey, Jasmine, I hear you love birds."
Jasmine says: "Sure!"
Stefan says: "Well, a little birdy told me that downstream, there's an island full of rare specimens."
Jasmine says: "*gasps* Did you hear that?"
Jasmine says: "Thanks, Stefan."
Jasmine says: "You're the best."
Stefan says: "Hey, Rodrigo."
Stefan says: "This is terrible."
Stefan says: "Jasmine is in danger!"
Rodrigo says: "W-What?"
Stefan says: "She's headed toward an island full of dangerous birds!"
Stefan says: "But if we go downstream, we can save her!"
Rodrigo says: "Okay!"
Rodrigo says: "Thanks, Stefan."
Rodrigo says: "You're the best."
Rodrigo says: "Thanks, Stefan."
Rodrigo says: "You're such a great guy!"
Stefan says: "Oh, you're great, too, you know."
Stefan says: "Great enough for Jasmine to like you."
Rodrigo says: "What?"
Stefan says: "I can tell from the way she looks at you."
Stefan says: "Huh?"
Rodrigo says: "Stefan!"
Rodrigo says: "What's happening to you?!"
Rodrigo says: "!"
Steven says: "OH, NO!"
Steven says: "NOT AGAIN!"
Trans. Int. Steven's Room.
Steven wakes up.
Peridot says: "Steven!"
Peridot says: "You did it!"
Peridot says: "You just fell asleep and you started glowing pink."
Peridot says: "And then the TV went on the fritz, and then- Oh, I'll just show you!"
Peridot says: "Our script, our story!"
Peridot says: "I watched the whole thing live!"
Peridot says: "Not sure what you were going for at the end there."
Peridot says: "That was pretty bizarre, but for a first attempt..."
Peridot says: "Steven?"
Steven says: "Oh, sorry."
Steven says: "Just feeling a little off."
Steven says: "Guess maybe the chili was a bad idea."
Peridot says: "Eh, don't worry about it."
Peridot says: "Our budget is nothing, and our schedule is infinite."
Steven says: "That's right."
Steven says: "I can do a re-dream."
Steven says: "We can do as many as we want until we get it right."
Peridot says: "Less talking, more sleeping."
Steven goes down in bed.

Peridot slams papers in the table.
Steven says: "Huh?"
Peridot says: "I've come to the conclusion that we keep failing because we're relying on a script when we should've taken a more visual approach."
Peridot says: "So I've prepared this storyboard for you."
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "You drew all of this in one night?"
Peridot says: "Well, duh!"
Peridot says: "I'm good at everything."
Peridot says: "Study these boards in preparation for this re-dream."
Steven says: "Oh, okay."
Steven says: "Wow."
Steven says: "You really posed this out."
Peridot says: "Thank you!"
Steven says: "Huh?"
Steven says: "*sees "Stefan" kissing Jasmine on the picture* Hey, Peridot, why is Stefan kissing Jasmine?"
Peridot says: "It's perfect, right?"
Peridot says: "Just as Rodrigo is about to swoop in and save his teenage dream, he stumbles upon..."
Peridot says: "*gasps loudly* Stefan!"
Peridot says: "His good friend whom he trusts so much..."
Peridot says: "kissing Jasmine..."
Peridot says: "thus stoking the fire of Rodrigo jealousy!"
Steven says: "I can't do Rodrigo "dirty" like that!"
Peridot says: "Whoa, Steven."
Peridot says: "Hold on."
Peridot says: "You're talking about them like they're real people."
Peridot says: "It's just a story."
Peridot says: "And a story needs conflict."
Steven says: "No!"
Steven says: "I can't do this!"
Peridot says: "Look, Steven, you seem pretty agitated."
Peridot says: "Let's just call this whole thing off."
Steven says: "What?"
Peridot says: "There's no point if you're gonna get all worked up over it."
Peridot says: "*sighs* I should probably be getting back to Little Homeworld anyway."
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "No!"
Steven says: "Wait!"
Steven says: "I'll do it."
Trans. Int. Camp Pining Hearts.
Stefan says: "Hey, Rodrigo."
Stefan says: "This is terrible."
Stefan says: "Jasmine is in danger!"
Rodrigo says: "W-What?"
Stefan says: "She's headed toward an island full of dangerous birds!"
Stefan says: "But if we go downstream, we can save her!"
Rodrigo says: "Okay!"
Rodrigo says: "Thanks, Stefan."
Rodrigo says: "You're the best."
Rodrigo says: "Wow, Stefan is so great."
Rodrigo says: "*gasps* What?!"
Rodrigo says: "!"
Rodrigo says: "*sees "Stefan" kissing Jasmine*..."
Rodrigo says: "Stefan!"
Rodrigo says: "How could you?!"
Rodrigo says: "!"
Trans. Int. Beach House into the past.
Steven wakes up, and sees the past into his house.
Steven says: "*sighs heavily*..."
Steven says: "Peridot?"
Steven says: "*walks over to Peridot* Peridot!"
Steven says: "Come on, we gotta stop!"
Steven says: "Are you listening to me?"
Steven says: "Why won't you look at me?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven turns her around, her gem and visor have been filled in with the SMPTE color bars and the rest of her face is neutral. Steven's past house disappears in his dream. Steven's pajamas turn into his own clothes and sees everything.
Steven says: "Peridot?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "Peridot!"
Steven says: "Where are you?"
Steven says: "Peridot!!"
Trans. Int. Steven's Dream.
Steven enters at Beach City but it exits out. Peridot walks alone at Steven's own house.
Steven says: "Peridot!"
Steven says: "Wait!"
Steven says: "*grunts; runs up* Stop!"
Steven says: "Don't go in there!"
Steven says: "Please!"
Steven says: "I still really want to hang out with you!"
Steven says: "Huh?"
Steven jumps out of the black hole.
Steven says: "Peridot!"
Steven says: "We've always had something to fix together!"
Steven says: "The Cluster, the Diamonds, or Spinel!"
Steven says: "I don't think I know how to be friend without something to fix!"
Steven says: "But I- I just can't do it anymore!"
Steven says: "I'm so tired."
Steven says: "Now I'm even doing it in my dreams!"
Steven says: "*starts crying* I'm sorry I can't do this for you!"
Steven says: "Please don't leave..."
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "Don't..."
Steven says: "Leave..."
The dream ends with a visual similar to removing a tape from a VCR.
Trans. Int. Steven's Room.
Peridot says: "*initially muffled* Steven?"
Peridot says: "Steven!"
Peridot says: "STEVEN!"
Steven is in bed, crying.
Peridot says: "Steven, I saw everything!"
Peridot says: "*stammers* It's fine!"
Peridot says: "We don't have to do this anymore."
Peridot says: "I don't care about the show, and I definitely don't care about Rodrigo!"
Peridot says: "Ugh, I'm such a clod!"
Steven says: "But I really wanted to spend time with you!"
Steven says: "I just wanted an excuse to hang out."
Peridot says: "We don't need an excuse to hang out."
Steven says: "Can we still watch CPH together?"
Steven says: "Even if it sucks?"
Peridot says: "*laughing, removing her visor* Of course."
Trans. Int. Steven's Room.
Jasmine is onscreen.
Jasmine says: "How could you lie to me like that, Rodrigo?"
Jasmine says: "I guess you just can't help being a bad person!"
Cut to Steven and Peridot at the foot of Steven's bed, watching the TV. Steven is eating popcorn. Both are laughing.
Peridot says: "Jasmine, you just buried a body in the woods, and now you're mad that Rodrigo cheated at cards?"
They continue laughing.
Peridot says: "This show is the worst!"
Steven says: "*smiling contently* This show is the best."
