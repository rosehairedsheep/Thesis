Steven and Greg are sitting outside the building and eating watermelons.
Steven says: "*spits out a seed and it lands on his cheek* Look, Dad!"
Steven says: "I'm Amadeus!"
Steven says: "*in a German accent* My father, he disapproves of me!"
Greg says: "Ha!"
Greg says: "Well check this out."
Greg takes a bite on his watermelon, closes his eyes, and spits out two seeds. The seeds land on his eyelids, forming pretend-eyes.
Greg says: "Ta-da!"
Greg says: "Betcha can't top that."
Steven says: "Bet I can."
Steven blows the seed off his cheek and bites into his watermelon. He stands up. takes a deep breath and spits a seed, knocking a can off a cone faraway. Greg is shocked.
Steven says: "*raises arm in triumph* Haha!"
Steven says: "Beat that!"
Greg says: "Haaa..."
Greg says: "That was impressive, my son."
Greg says: "But the name of the game ain't distance nor accuracy."
Steven says: "It ain't?"
Greg says: "No Steven, this challenge is all about who can spit the coolest."
Greg says: "Allow me to demonstrate."
Greg chews on a watermelon slice and places on it on the ground. He winks at Steven and then hunches over. He then spits three seeds between his legs into the watermelon slice, which  flings them back over him and he catches them in his hand.
Steven says: "*applauds* Wow, Dad!"
Steven says: "*sees that Greg is not responding* Uh..."
Steven says: "Dad?"
Steven says: "You okay?"
Greg says: "*hunched over*..."
Greg says: "Help me, son!"
Greg says: "..."
Greg says: "Beat..."
Greg says: "that."
Steven says: "What?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "You're asking for it!"
Steven says: "*proceeds to eat several watermelons* You're really  asking for it!"
Steven says: "*pauses* Hurricane..."
Steven says: "Spin..."
Steven says: "Spiiiiiiit!!!"
Steven says: "*twirls and spits watermelon seeds everywhere, even on Greg* My hurricane spin spit is unbeatable!"
Greg says: "*shocked* By jove!"
Greg says: "It's full of seeds!"
Steven says: "Dad?"
Greg says: "Congratulations, son."
Greg says: "You win by a mile."
Greg says: "*starts to make a crown out of a watermelon slice and puts it on Steven's head* I crown thee, Your Water-Melojesty."
Greg says: "*bows, and Steven bows back* My liege."
Steven and Greg start laughing uncontrollably.
Time Skip — Next morning.
Steven is fast asleep on a lawn chair in front of It's A Wash. He yawns as he slowly wakes up and looks around, noticing tons of oddly-shaped watermelons had grown all around him.
Steven says: "Huh..."
Steven says: "?"
Steven says: "Holy watermelon!"
Steven says: "*picks up a watermelon that resembles himself* Is this..."
Steven says: "?"
Steven says: "*gasps* Can it be..."
Steven says: "?"
Steven says: "They're me!"
Steven says: "They're all me!"
Steven bring the Crystal Gems to check on the strange occurrence.
Garnet says: "Hmm."
Garnet says: "This is really impressive."
Pearl says: "I suppose..."
Pearl says: "Your mother had the power to grow sentient plant life to act as her defenders."
Amethyst says: "But Rose's plants moved and stuff."
Amethyst says: "*picks up a smaller-looking watermelon* These guys don't do..."
Amethyst says: "anything."
Steven says: "Amethyst, be careful."
Steven says: "This one's just a baby."
Steven says: "*takes the watermelon and looks at it* Aww!"
Steven says: "Look at him, so precious."
Greg says: "*tries to tread through the field of watermelons* Ugh..."
Greg says: "*accidentally steps on one*  Ohh..."
Greg says: "This is really weird..."
Greg says: "What are we gonna do with all of them?"
Steven gasps as he has an idea.

Mr. Smiley says: "Steven!"
Mr. Smiley says: "What's going on here?"

Steven says: "*sees Sadie approaching* Hey there!"
Sadie says: "Hey Steven!"
Sadie says: "What's all this about?"
Steven says: "Just a little side project that I got going on."
Sadie says: "Oh, really?"
Sadie says: "Ha, that's great."
Sadie says: "How did you get such handsome watermelons?"

Ronaldo says: "watermelon guys..."
Ronaldo says: "down by the Funland..."
Ronaldo says: "entrance..."
Ronaldo says: "It's..."
Ronaldo says: "really..."
Ronaldo says: "weird..."
Steven and Sadie watch on as Ronaldo slowly types away.
Sadie says: "Steven, you shouldn't keep your customers waiting like this."
Sadie says: "I'll just give you five bucks and take one, okay?"
Ronaldo says: "What?"
Ronaldo says: "You're only selling them for five dollars!"
Ronaldo says: "?"
Ronaldo says: "Hey everybody!!"
Ronaldo says: "Come get a Watermelon Steven!"
Ronaldo says: "He's practically giving them away!"
Ronaldo says: "Hurry before they're gone forever!"
A crowd of people rush over to Steven's fruit stand to buy Watermelon Stevens. Some time passes, Steven is counting all the money he has collected from the sale.
Steven says: "And another, and another, and another, and another..."
Steven says: "Cool, one hundred pieces of money."
Onion appears from underneath the fruit stand and gets out from it.
Steven says: "Oh, hey Onion."
Onion beckons with his hand.
Steven says: "Umm, you want..."
Steven says: "my money?"
Onion looks up, shakes his head and beckons again.
Steven says: "Oh, sorry for the misunderstanding."
Steven says: "I'm all out of Watermelon Stevens."
Onion points at Baby Melon.
Steven says: "Sorry Onion, Baby Melon is not for sale."
Steven looks away for a second and finds that Onion, and Baby Melon, has vanished.
Steven says: "Ooniiiooon!!"
Steven chases after Onion, who is running away with Baby Melon.
Steven says: "*growls* Give me back my Baby Melon!"
Baby Melon suddenly comes alive in Onion's grip. Onion quickly drops him and Baby Melon runs up to Steven to hug him.
Steven says: "My Baby Melon!"
Steven says: "Aah, my precious..."
Steven says: "I..."
Steven says: "thought I'd never see you again..."
Steven suddenly realizes and looks at the living baby watermelon, as he winks at him.
Steven says: "You're..."
Steven says: "ALIIIVVVVEEE?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "I really shouldn't be so surprised about this..."
Steven says: "."
Steven says: "Oh man, the other ones must be alive too, right?"
Baby Melon hugs Steven, unaware of the question. Steven begins to go all over Beach City to returns buyers their money and round up the Watermelon Stevens, who also begin coming alive.

Steven says: "Ow..."
All the Watermelon Stevens turn to look at Ronaldo.
Ronaldo says: "Wha—"
Ronaldo says: "G-get away from me!"
Ronaldo says: "Stay back!"

Pearl, Garnet, and Amethyst leaves the house and gasp in amazement to see a crowd of Watermelon Stevens standing at the beach.
Amethyst says: "Wooow..."
Pearl says: "You said they're hurting people?"
Steven nods.
Garnet says: "Rose's plants lived to fight."
Pearl says: "He can't control them."
The Watermelon Stevens takes a step forward, looking angry.
Pearl says: "Get in the house."
Pearl says: "Now!"
Pearl pushes Steven inside the house and the Watermelon Stevens hisses loudly.
Amethyst says: "Oooh what!"
Amethyst says: "?"
Amethyst says: "Bring it, melons!"
The Gems leap onto the beach to confront the Watermelon Stevens.
Garnet says: "Gems, do your thing."
Garnet, Pearl, and Amethyst begin destroying the Watermelon Stevens.
Steven says: "Wait, don't!"
Steven says: "Come on Baby Melon, we have to stop this."
Garnet, Pearl, and Amethyst continues to destroy several Watermelon Stevens.
Garnet says: "Come on!"
Garnet is then tackled by many Watermelon Stevens, piling and pinning her down.
Steven says: "Everyone!"
Steven says: "Please stop!"
Steven says: "I'm okay, look!"
Steven says: "*raises hands in the air* You don't have to fight anymore!"
Amethyst says: "*pinned by the Watermelon Stevens and cries in distress* They're gonna put me in the ground!"
Amethyst says: "*cries more* Noo!"
Amethyst says: "Noo!"
Amethyst says: "Aaah!"
Two Watermelon Stevens  are digging a hole in the sand and another one brings in a banquet of purplish flowers.
Amethyst says: "Those flowers are lovely!!"
Pearl says: "*wrestling with the Watermelon Stevens* Let go of my spear, you little twerps!"
Pearl says: "I'll destroy you!"
Garnet is still trying to get all the Watermelon Stevens off her.
Steven says: "This is bad, Baby Melly."
Steven says: "How do we end this carnage?"
Baby Melon closes his eyes and punches Steven in the belly, knocking him back on the sand and grasping the other watermelons' attention.
Steven says: "Baby..."
Steven says: "Melon?"
Baby Melon stretches his arms out in content as several Watermelon Stevens tackle him, causing a cloud of sand to envelop the place.
Steven says: "Wha- Woaaah!"
After the cloud subsides, Steven tries to push his way through the crowd of Watermelon Stevens to Baby Melon.
Steven says: "Ugh, let me through, you melon heads!"
Steven says: "*sees a destroyed Baby Melon* Ba-Baby Melon..."
Steven says: "."
Steven says: "*starts walking to Baby Melon's remains* I understand..."
Steven says: "You stopped the watermelons from fighting everyone else..."
Steven says: "."
Steven says: "by making them fight you."
Steven holds up Baby Melon's remains in anger for the other Watermelon Stevens to see.
Steven says: "Look at what you've done!"
Steven says: "You think I wanted this?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "You should all be ashamed!"
Steven says: "He knew this is what it would take to calm your rage!"
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "He understood true loyalty."
There is a momentary silence.
Steven says: "Go!"
Steven says: "Think about what you've done!"
Steven says: "And don't come back until you understand what he did for me, for all of us!"
The Watermelon Stevens begin walking away, splitting up into different paths; some head into the ocean, some travel far into the land.
Garnet says: "Spoken like a true king."
Steven says: "They don't need a king."
Steven says: "They're their own melons now."
Pearl and Amethyst proudly place their hands on Steven's shoulder, as they watch the Watermelon Stevens leave. Steven then takes a bite on Baby Melon's remains and the Gems react in disgust. The star iris then zooms in on Steven munching the watermelon, ending the episode.
END.
