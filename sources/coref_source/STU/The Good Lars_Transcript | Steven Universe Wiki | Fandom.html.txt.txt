Open Int. The Big Donut.
Sadie presents a plate of an orange pumpkin-shaped bread to Steven on the counter. He cuts a small slice from the bread and eats it, while Lars glances away nearby.
Sadie says: "So, how is it?"
Lars says: "Be honest, but not too honest."
Steven says: "It's pumpkin bread!"
Steven says: "And it's pumpkin-shaped, like a pumpkin!"
Steven says: "This is the best idea anybody has ever had!"
Sadie says: "See?"
Sadie says: "I told you."
Sadie says: "It's really good."
Lars says: "Of course Steven likes it."
Lars says: "He likes everything."
Steven says: "Lars, did you make this?"
Lars says: "No!"
Lars says: "Well, yes, but it's no big deal."
Sadie says: "Secret's out, Lars."
Sadie says: "Feels good, doesn't it?"
Lars says: "*blushes* Ah, stop."
Steven says: "Oh, this is amazing!"
Steven says: "How'd you get it to look like a pumpkin?"
Lars says: "I just made seven small crescent-shaped cakes and used cream cheese icing to hold them together."
Lars says: "Anyone with two hands and half a brain could do it."
Lars says: "And, you know, a recipe."
Sadie says: "That's his way of saying thanks."
Steven says: "I know."
Steven says: "I speak Lars."
Just then, the doorbell chimes and Buck Dewey walks in.
Lars says: "B-B-B-Buck Dewey!"
Panicking, Lars quickly hides his pumpkin bread behind the counter and leans onto the counter, sweating and smiling anxiously.
Steven says: "Hi, Buck."
Buck says: "Hey, Steven."
Buck says: "Hey, donut kids."
Lars says: "*hastily* Hi, Buck, what's up?!"
Lars says: "!"
Lars says: "How's it going!"
Lars says: "?"
Lars says: "What'll it be?!"
Lars says: "!"
Buck says: "I want to order..."
Buck says: "you to come to dinner."
Buck says: "Me, Jenny, and Sour Cream are having a potluck."
Buck says: "You know, like parents do."
Buck says: "Except we'll be doing it."
Buck says: "All three of you should come."
Buck says: "You should bring some food, because that's what you do at a potluck."
Buck says: "It's so funny."
Lars says: "*laughs anxiously* That is funny, Buck!"
Lars says: "It sounds great!"
Lars says: "*make thumbs-ups* Super cool!"
Lars says: "Can't wait!"
Lars says: "*makes gun hands* Bingo, bongo!"
Buck says: "Cool."
Lars says: "*puts face in his hands and groans loudly* "Bingo, bongo"!"
Lars says: "?"
Lars says: "Where did I even learn that?"
Steven says: "Yeah!"
Steven says: "*imitates Lars* Bingo, bongo!"
Steven says: "This is gonna be great."
Sadie says: "Hey, yeah, this is perfect."
Sadie says: "You won't believe us when we say we like your cooking, but you'll have to believe it when it's coming from Buck."
Lars groans and plants his face onto the counter.
Sadie says: "Uh, Lars?"
Lars says: "I'm not going."
Sadie says: "What?!"
Sadie says: "!"
Sadie says: "You just got invited to a party with the Cool Kids!"
Sadie says: "Isn't that what you've always wanted?"
Sadie says: "If anyone shouldn't go, it's me."
Sadie says: "But they know you; they like you!"
Lars says: "Nah-ah."
Lars says: "Nobody knows me."
Lars says: "And nobody knows I can bake."
Sadie says: "Well, I do, and he does."
Steven says: "Yeah, Lars, you should make this your big debut."
Lars says: "Well..."
Lars says: "then, it has to be perfect."
Trans. Int. Lars' house.
Lars paces around his room contemplating, while Steven lays on his bed and Sadie sits on a chair.
Steven says: "How about a pie?"
Lars says: "No."
Sadie says: "Uh, baked Alaska?"
Lars says: "Mmm..."
Lars says: "It might look like I'm trying too hard."
Lars says: "Hmm..."
Steven says: "Hmm..."
Sadie says: "Hmm..."
Lars says: "Yeah, something cream-filled."
Lars says: "A bundt?"
Lars says: "A cannoli?"
Lars says: "Maybe some rugelach?"
Lars says: "*puts his hands in his face* Gah!"
Lars says: "I don't know!"
Sadie says: "Maybe we could make a cake with your face on it."
Steven says: "That's a great idea!"
Steven says: "You should make something that represents you."
Lars gazes at himself in the mirror. He then lifts up the edge of his bed and pulls out a cookbook.
Steven says: "*gasps* Secret cookbook."
Lars says: "Maybe this'll work."
Lars says: "*sits on his bed and opens up his cookbook* I used to eat this as a kid all the time."
Steven says: "Wow."
Steven says: "What's..."
Steven says: "uby?"
Lars says: "It's ube."
Sadie says: "What's that?"
Lars says: "*blushes* Uh, like, you know, it's like a sweet potato."
Steven says: "Potatoes can be sweet?"
Lars says: "I mean, it's technically a yam."
Steven says: "Yams?!"
Steven says: "!"
Sadie says: "This sounds perfect!"
Lars goes downstairs and peeks from the staircase. Once he sees his parents are not around, he signals Sadie and Steven follow him downstairs. A montage begins as Lars explains the recipe procedures to Sadie and Steven. The trio gathers various ingredients such as flour, eggs, milk, and ube, and they begin to bake.
Lars separates an egg yolk from the egg white using the egg shells. Steven attempts the procedure but accidentally drops the egg. Sadie uses a mixer to mix the ingredients together, but accidentally sends some of the paste flying everywhere. Steven then attempts to pour the ube mix out of its bag and into the paste, accidentally splashing some of the paste out of the bowl too.
(Lars takes over the rest of the procedures says: "mixing the ube with the paste, laying wax paper into a pan, pouring the ube mix onto it and baking it."
(Lars takes over the rest of the procedures says: "Once the ube cake is baked, Lars spreads cream onto it and rolls it up."
(Lars takes over the rest of the procedures says: "He finally tops the cake with three dollops of cream and present the cake on a plate on the table in front of Sadie and Steven."
(Lars takes over the rest of the procedures says: ")"
Lars says: "It's done."
Steven and Sadie look at each other before taking a small piece from the ube cake and eating it.
Lars says: "So, how is it?"
Steven says: "It's..."
Steven says: "Amazing!"
Sadie says: "Amazing!"
Sadie says: "This is delicious."
Steven says: "You're an amazing baker, Lars."
Lars says: "Well, yeah, of course I am."
Lars looks down and finds that Steven and Sadie have almost instantaneously devoured the whole ube cake.
Steven says: "Sorry, Lars."
Steven says: "It's really good."
Lars says: "Guess I have to take your word for it."
Time-Skip, Evening.
Sadie says: "I'm gonna head out and get my stuff for the party."
Sadie says: "This is it!"
Sadie says: "It's all happening!"
Sadie says: "Lars and the Cool Kids!"
Sadie says: "See ya there!"
Sadie leaves Lars' house, as he places another baked ube cake on the table.
Steven says: "Bye, Sadie."
Steven says: "*sighs* Everything is so good."
Lars says: "Yeah, too good."
Steven says: "What do you mean?"
Lars says: "*blushes* Uhh..."
Lars says: "Never mind."
Steven says: "Aw, come on."
Steven says: "You can tell me anything."
Steven says: "I spent a day in your body."
Lars says: "It's nothing."
Lars says: "Forget about it."
Lars continues to spread cream on the ube cake in silence, when Steven reaches out and places his hand on Lars' shoulder.
Steven says: "*whispers* Open up about your feelings."
Lars says: "*sighs* I'm not worried about the cake."
Lars says: "The cake is gonna rule."
Lars says: "I'm worried about showing up with a cake."
Steven says: "What do you mean?"
Lars says: "There's a reason I don't like telling anybody I like baking."
Steven says: "And..."
Steven says: "What's that?"
Lars says: "Because..."
Lars says: "It's lame, Steven!"
Lars says: "If I show up to this party with my family's weird purple cake and with Sadie, everybody's gonna know I love baking and everybody's gonna know I love..."
Lars says: "*blushes* This isn't gonna be an ironic potluck!"
Lars says: "It's gonna be, like, family, couple, neighbor, actual potluck, and I'm gonna be there being all..."
Lars says: ""bingo, bongo"."
Steven says: "These are your friends."
Steven says: "They want you to come."
Steven says: "That's why they invited you, so they'll get to know you better."
Steven says: "If they like you, they like you."
Steven says: "If they don't, then it's their loss."
Steven says: "Right?"
Lars says: "*lays his head onto the table* That's pretty smart."
Lars says: "When did you get so mature?"
Steven says: "Somewhere in between learning to summon my shield and finding out my mom is a war criminal."
Lars says: "*slams the table and stands up in determination* Okay!"
Lars says: "I'll do it."
Steven says: "Lars!"
Steven says: "It's going to go so good!"
Steven says: "I got to get going and make my thing, but I'll see you there, right?"
Lars says: "Yeah."
Lars says: "Yeah!"
Lars says: "I'll see you."
Trans. Ext. Sour Cream's House, Evening.
Steven is waiting outside of Sour Cream's house, as the front door is shortly opened by Sour Cream.
Sour Cream says: "Hey, man."
Steven says: "Who's feeling lucky?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven enters into the living room and places his plate of sushi on the table, next to the other food items.
Steven says: "My, my."
Steven says: "What a feast."
Sour Cream says: "*sits on the couch* I brought the soda."
Jenny says: "*sits on the couch too* I brought the pizza."
Buck says: "*sits on the couch three* I brought the assorted fruit."
Steven says: "I can't wait for Lars to get here."
Steven says: "He made a- Wait, wait, I shouldn't tell you."
Steven says: "It's a surprise."
Buck says: "That Lars is full of surprises."
Buck says: "The other day, he did this thing."
Buck says: "What was it?"
Buck says: "*makes gun hands* Bingo, bongo."
Buck says: "It was transcendent."
Jenny says: "That is so creative."
Sour Cream says: "*makes gun hands too* Bingo, bongo."
Just then, the doorbell rings.
Steven says: "That's him!"
Steven says: "*runs and opens the door, only to find Sadie* Oh, Sadie."
Steven says: "Where's Lars?"
Sadie says: "He's not here yet?"
Steven says: "He's probably still working on the cake."
Steven says: "This is his ube debut, after all."
Steven says: "*chuckles* Why don't you come on in?"
Sadie says: "Oh, uh..."
Steven and Sadie walk into the living room, where the cool kids are chatting and laughing among themselves.
Jenny says: "I love me some cheese."
Buck says: "You and your fancy cheese plates."
Jenny says: "*notices Sadie* Oh, hey, it's donut girl."
Steven says: "Everybody, this is Sadie."
Sadie says: "Uh, hi."
Sadie says: "I'm Lars'..."
Sadie says: "friend."
Jenny says: "What's up?"
Jenny says: "I'm Jenny."
Buck says: "Hey again."
Sour Cream says: "I'm Sour Cream."
Sour Cream says: "Welcome to my house!"
Buck says: "So, tell us, Sadie, what did you bring to our very cool potluck?"
Sadie says: "Sorry, I didn't bring any food."
Sadie says: "Just these paper plates."
Sadie says: "It's just, uhh..."
Sadie says: "They're for Lars' thing, and he's not even here."
Sour Cream says: "Did you say plates?"
Sour Cream says: "*turns off the lights and throws some glow sticks onto the floor* Hooray!"
Sour Cream says: "*switches on the lights* Now I don't have to do the dishes."
Sadie says: "Wow, I never thought anyone could get excited over paper plates."
Sadie says: "I guess they are biodegradable."
Sadie says: "But I'm still worried about Lars."
Steven says: "I'll go find him, don't you worry about it."
Steven says: "Hang out, have fun!"
Sour Cream says: "You can sit on the bean bag."
Jenny says: "Yeah, that bean bag is sick."
Jenny says: "You got to try it."
Sadie says: "Oh, all right."
Sadie says: "*sits on the bean bag* What do you know?"
Sadie says: "I fit."
The cool kids and Sadie laugh together.
Jenny says: "Told ya."
Steven says: "*exits the house* I'll be right back with Lars."
Steven says: "*closes the door* Now, where could he be?"
Steven begins running all around town to look for Lars. He first goes to Lars' house and speaks with his parents, who also do not know where Lars is. He stops by the Big Donut which closed for the night, asks Peedee by the Beach Citywalk Fries, and asks Mr. Smiley at the Funland Arcade, all with no luck. He then leaps high up into the sky, above Beach City.
Steven says: "*shouting* LLAAAAAAAARRRSS!!"
Steven says: "*lands back on the ground* Laaaars!"
Steven says: "If only there was some way to contact him, with my mind..."
Steven says: "Oh, wait, or with my phone!"
Lars Voicemail.
Steven says: "Laaaaars!"
Steven says: "- I-I mean, Lars, hi."
Steven says: "This is Steven."
Steven says: "Uhh..."
Steven says: "I was just wondering where you were."
Steven says: "The potluck is going really great."
Steven says: "Everyone's having a nice time, and we're all excited for you to come join the fun."
Steven says: "*begins walking back to Sour Cream's house* Or maybe I just missed you and you're already back at the party..."
Steven says: "And that's the sound of you enjoying music with all our friends."
Steven says: "Or..."
Steven checks the garbage bin outside of Sour Cream's house and sees Lars' ube cake inside.
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "Maybe you decided not to go inside."
Steven says: "Th-That's okay, though."
Steven says: "Guess I'll..."
Steven says: "see you later."
Steven hangs out, sighs in dismay, and closes the garbage bin. He then heads back inside and finds the cool kids and Sadie singing and playing music together.
Sour Cream says: "All right!"
Jenny says: "Nice!"
Jenny says: "Hey, nice ending."
Sour Cream says: "Yeah, whoo!"
Buck says: "Yeah, Sadie."
Buck says: "That was fresh."
Buck says: "Oh, hey, it's Steven."
Sadie says: "Hey, Steven, we've been having such a blast over here."
Sadie says: "Did you find Lars?"
Steven says: "Uh, yeah."
Steven says: "He- he can't make it tonight."
Steven says: "Something came up."
Sadie says: "Ah, bummer, huh?"
Sadie says: "*sighs* Well, that's okay."
Sadie says: "Let's keep playing music."
Jenny says: "Yeah!"
Sour Cream says: "Right on."
Trans. Ext. Sour Cream's house, Night-time.
Cool Kids says: "Bye, guys."
Cool Kids says: "See ya."
Cool Kids says: "Bye, guys."
Sadie says: "Later, guys."
Sadie says: "*exits the house with Steven* So..."
Sadie says: "He decided not to come, huh?"
Steven says: "Actually..."
Steven shows Sadie the discarded ube cake inside the garbage bin.
Sadie says: "Aw, geez."
Sadie says: "Lars."
Steven says: "Maybe we should've tried harder to get him to come?"
Sadie says: "Guess so."
Steven and Sadie begin walking home.
Sadie says: "Ughh."
Sadie says: "He wants to be in with them so much."
Sadie says: "Huh, it's funny."
Sadie says: "I never thought I'd be the one hanging out with them."
Sadie says: "You know, they really are cool."
Sadie says: "Like, not like he thinks, but, like- like, they're actually cool people."
Sadie says: "How's he going to realize that if he doesn't give them a chance?"
Sadie says: "I wish I could just force him to be happy."
Sadie says: "Oh, no."
Sadie says: "I sound like my mother."
Sadie says: "Maybe I should be trying to fix my life instead of his."
Steven says: "*somberly* Bingo, bongo..."
Steven and Sadie then stop at a crossroad.
Sadie says: "Goodnight, Steven."
Steven says: "Goodnight, Sadie."
Steven and Sadie go their separate ways from the crossroad. As Sadie continues walking home, a large shadow appears behind her. A smaller, winged shadow appears beside it, as eerie music plays.
END.
