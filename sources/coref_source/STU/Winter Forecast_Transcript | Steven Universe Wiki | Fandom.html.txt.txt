Open int. Beach House.
Steven and Connie are sitting by the fireplace, while Steven is roasting marshmallows on a stick.
Steven says: "Mmm..."
Steven says: "You're roasting good!"
Steven says: "*withdraws a roasted marshmallow away from the fire* And..."
Connie says: "Good job not setting that one on fire."
Steven says: "Mm-hmm."
Steven says: "What is it about marshmallows that make them so..."
Steven says: "good?"
Connie says: "It's probably the animal by-product."
Steven says: "*slightly disgusted* You mean like..."
Steven says: "poop?"
Connie says: "*picks up a marshmallow* No."
Connie says: "Stuff like hooves, bone marrow, collagen..."
Connie says: "*eats it* and lots of sugar and corn syrup."
Steven says: "*yells* Corn Sugar!"
Connie says: "*yells* Sugar syrup!"
Connie says: "*shoves a handful of marshmallows into her mouth* Mmm!"
Connie says: "Bone marrow!"
Steven and Connie laugh together, when Connie's cellphone rings.
Connie says: "*picks up the phone* Hello?"
Dr. Maheswaran says: "*over the phone phone* Have you been watching World Weather News?"
Connie says: "Um..."
Connie says: "no."
Connie says: "*swallows the marshmallows in her mouth* Steven's still grounded from watching TV."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "I see."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "Well, there's a snowstorm on its way to Beach City, and I don't want you getting snowed in."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "You need to get a ride home this instant."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "Otherwise your father is gonna try to pick you up."
Connie says: "*gets worried* Oh no."
Connie says: "Don't send Dad."
Connie says: "I'll be home soon."
Connie says: "*hangs up her phone* Looks like I gotta get going."
Steven says: "*mouth full of marshmallows* Oh, no..."
Connie says: "There's a snowstorm coming through, and my parents don't want me getting stuck here."
Steven says: "*swallows his marshmallows* Man!"
Steven says: "That stinks!"
Connie says: "*sighs* Wouldn't it be fun if we got snowed in together?"
Steven says: "*gasps* We could stay up all night and watch the snow fall!"
Steven and Connie smile at each other. The Gem then walks into the house from the Crystal Temple.
Garnet says: "Hello, you two."
Steven says: "Hi, Garnet."
Connie says: "Hi, Garnet."
Pearl says: "You all having a nice time?"
Steven says: "*walks over with Connie* Yeah, but Connie has to go soon."
Steven says: "There's a snowstorm-a-comin'."
Connie says: "Maybe the storm will miss us."
Connie says: "Sometimes the forecast is completely wrong."
Garnet says: "Nope."
Garnet says: "It's definitely going to snow."
Amethyst says: "*makes a rap gesture* That's the 411, yo."
Garnet says: "Trust."
Steven says: "*gasps and whispers to Connie* Garnet has future vision."
Garnet says: "You kids better get yourselves to Greg's."
Steven says: "Wait!"
Steven says: "We can't go yet."
Steven says: "*turns to Connie* I've got to show you this TubeTube video really quick."
Garnet says: "Steven."
Steven says: "It's only, like, one minute long."
Garnet says: "*walks over and kneels in front of Steven* I know you don't want to go, but you have to make the right choice."
Garnet says: "*kisses him on the forehead* Mwah!"
Steven says: "*blushes and giggles, holding his forehead* That tickles!"
Trans. Ext. It's A Wash.
Steven and Connie arrive at Greg's car wash, when it begins to snow.
Steven says: "*watching the snow fall* Wow!"
Steven says: "*gets pelted in the head by a snowball* Aah!"
Connie says: "*laughs* Gotcha, Steven!"
Steven and Connie laugh together as Steven wipes the snowball off his head.
Greg says: "Come on, kids."
Greg says: "We got to go if we're gonna beat the storm."
Greg says: "I'll start the van."
Steven says: "Aw, do we got to go?"
Greg says: "Yes."
Greg says: "The Maheswarans think I'm a responsible parent, and I've got to maintain that image."
Connie says: "*sighs* Guess this is it."
Steven says: "Well, Dad."
Steven says: "*grabs Connie and smushes a snowball into her face, causing her to giggle* If you want to look responsible, you should probably change out of that sweatsuit."
Greg says: "But it's cherries."
Greg says: "Everybody likes cherries."
Greg says: "I'm a cherry man!"
Greg says: "*pauses* Okay, I see your point."
Greg says: "Just give me a second to change."
Connie says: "*whispering* Steven, are you procrastinating?"
Steven says: "*whispers back* Nah."
Steven says: "I'm just killing time."
Greg says: "*rummages through a clothing pile in the back of his van and pulls out a dark green turtleneck sweater* Aha!"
Greg says: "You can practically smell the responsibility."
Steven says: "Isn't that the turtleneck you wore the first time you met them?"
Steven says: "They're gonna think you only have one fancy shirt."
Greg says: "..."
Greg says: "I do only have one fancy shirt."
Steven says: "Don't worry, Dad."
Steven says: "We'll help you find the perfect, most responsible outfit."
Greg says: "I don't know."
Greg says: "I haven't worn any of this stuff in years."
Time passes by as Greg trying on various outfits, while Steven and Connie goof around in the snow. Whenever Greg comes out of the van with a new outfit, Steven and Connie stop playing and shake their heads in disagreement, forcing Greg back into the van to change. He eventually comes out of the van wearing a disco outfit.
Greg says: "Okay, how about this one?"
Steven says: "..."
Steven says: "I can't lie."
Steven says: "That is the best outfit I've ever seen."
Greg says: "Okay-great-let's-go!"
Steven and Connie get into the van and Greg starts driving off. The group watch as snow begins to cover the windshield.
Greg says: "Holy moly!"
Greg says: "*turns on the car heater and windshield wipers* That snow is really coming down!"
The van rolls over a patch of ice, causing it to skid wildly on the road. The group starts screaming as the van spins out of control and the snow constantly covers the windshield, despite the wipers. The van eventually crashes into a snowbank on the side of the road. The group quickly catch their breath.
Connie says: "W-what are we gonna do?"
Greg says: "Uhh..."
Greg says: "I guess we'll have to walk."
Steven says: "WHAT?!"
Connie says: "WHAT?!"
Steven says: "!"
Connie says: "!"
Greg says: "A responsible parent doesn't let two kids strand themselves in a van in the middle of nowhere."
The group starts treading through the thick snow and strong snowstorm.
Greg says: "*strained yelling* A responsible parent escorts those kids through wind, sleet, and snow to avoid making the other parent angry!"
Trans. Ext. Connie's house.
The group eventually arrive at Connie's house. They rapidly knock on the door and ring the doorbell till Dr. and Mr. Maheswaran open the door, greeting a violently shivering Greg, Steven, and Connie.
Connie says: "H-hi, Mom."
Connie says: "Hi, Dad."
Steven says: "H-hello, Dr."
Steven says: "and Mr."
Steven says: "Maheswaran."
Greg says: "Sorry we're late."
Connie's parents stare blankly as Steven, Connie and Greg step into the house.
Connie says: "Mom, Dad..."
Connie says: "*chuckles nervously*..."
Connie says: "You remember Mr."
Connie says: "Universe and Ste—"
Dr. Maheswaran says: "*yells* Do you have any idea what time it is?!"
Dr. Maheswaran says: "!"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "*yells* Why are the children blue?!"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "!"
Dr. Maheswaran says: "What are you do—"
Dr. Maheswaran says: "..."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "She's sick!"
Dr. Maheswaran says: "*grabs Connie by the arm* You're going straight to bed, young lady!"
Dr. Maheswaran says: "*drags her away* That's the last time I let you out during flu season."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "*crosses his arms* I think you know where the door is."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "Since you're..."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "standing in it."
Greg says: "Uhh, I kind of crashed my ride."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "Are you serious?!"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "!"
Greg says: "*timidly* Yes..."
Greg says: "?"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "*groans* I'll go set up the pull-out couch."
Greg says: "Uhh..."
Greg says: "okay."
Greg says: "So much for being responsible."
Greg says: "*starts stroking and squeezing his hair dry* Maybe I should have worn the floral print."
Steven stares ahead intently and gazes upon the trippy blue pattern on the back of Greg's disco outfit. Slowly, the blue pattern morphs into hypnotizing swirls, as Steven begins to sweat nervously and holds his head in anxiety.
Trans. Int. Greg's van, earlier that day.
The tires screech as the van crashes again. Steven slowly wakes up as Connie and Greg catch their breath.
Greg says: "Is everyone okay?"
Connie says: "Yeah."
Steven says: "*looks around, dazed* W-wait..."
Steven says: "What—"
Steven says: "W-what happened?"
Greg says: "We wiped out."
Steven says: "No, I mean, why are we in the van?"
Greg says: "You're right."
Greg says: "We gotta get out there and start walking if we wanna get Connie home."
Steven says: "Dad!"
Steven says: "No!"
Steven says: "We should stay put."
Steven says: "It'll be way safer this way."
Connie says: "My parents are all about safety."
Greg says: "Heh."
Greg says: "They can't argue with safety."
Steven says: "It'll be like camping!"
Connie says: "But in cozy bucket seats!"
Time passes by as the van slowly becomes more and more covered in the snowstorm. Greg cracks an egg over a waffle maker in the back of the van, and it sizzles as it cooks.
Connie says: "Thanks for dinner, Mr."
Connie says: "Universe."
Connie says: "Itadakimasu!"
Steven says: "*grabs Greg's nearby guitar and begins to strum* Any requests?"
Connie says: "Hmm."
Connie says: "Let's hear a song about..."
Connie says: "a snack monster!"
Connie says: "That loves..."
Connie says: "animal by-products!"
Connie says: "Om-nom-nom!"
Connie says: "Hello?"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "Connie, are you still at Steven Universe's house?"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "I'm on my way."
Connie says: "Dad, no!"
Connie says: "You know how bad you are at driving in the snow!"
Connie says: "It's way too rough out here!"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "I'm almost at Beach City, so start putting on your shoes."
Greg and Steven return back to their seats and turns back on the windshield wipers.
Steven says: "I see some headlights."
Steven says: "Is that him?"
An engine revs as Mr. Maheswaran's car pulls around the corner.
Mr. Maheswaran says: "Don't worry."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "I got it this time."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "Oh, wait."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "Ooh!"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "Aaaaah!"
Connie says: "Dad, stop the car!"
Connie says: "You're right in front of us!"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "I-I got it!"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "I got it!"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "I—"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "I don't have anything!"
Mr. Maheswaran's car smashes into the van, and the hypnotizing blue swirls Steven previously saw makes a reappearance.
Trans. Ext. It's A Wash!, earlier that day.
Steven gets hit in the head by a snowball and screams in panic. He turns around and glares around Connie.
Connie says: "Woah."
Connie says: "Sorry, Steven."
Connie says: "Are you okay?"
Steven says: "Connie, what's going on?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "Everything keeps repeating!"
Greg says: "Hey, come on, kids."
Greg says: "We got to go if we're gonna beat the storm."
Greg says: "I'll start the van."
Steven snatches Greg's car keys.
Greg says: "Hey!"
Greg says: "What the—"
Greg says: "??"
Steven tosses them into a nearby snowbank.
Greg says: "My keys!"
Greg says: "I'm not gonna find those till spring!"
Steven says: "*grabs Connie's arm and begins to pull her away* Come on, Connie!"
Connie says: "What?"
Greg says: "Hey!"
Steven says: "Let's go back to my place."
Connie says: "But my parents—"
Steven says: "*abruptly stops and grabs onto Connie's shoulders* No, Connie!"
Steven says: "You have to listen to me!"
Steven says: "If we leave Beach City, bad things are gonna happen!"
Steven says: "I've seen it!"
Steven says: "Bad things!"
Steven says: "Several bad things!"
Connie says: "Um..."
Connie says: "okay."
Connie says: "Let me just call my mom and tell her."
Steven and Connie are still running towards Steven's home.
Connie says: "Mom, this is Connie."
Connie says: "I'm staying at Steven's overnight."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "Oh, no, you're not, young lady!"
Connie says: "But..."
Connie says: "Mom!"
Dr. Maheswaran says: "You're coming home right now!"
Steven says: "*snatches Connie's phone* Dr."
Steven says: "Maheswaran, you can't let your husband leave the house!"
Steven says: "He can't drive in the snow!"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "*in the background* What?"
Mr. Maheswaran says: "Y-Yes, I can!"
Steven says: "Please, trust me!"
Connie says: "Hey!"
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Steven and Connie returns back to the beach house, where they find the Gems sitting in a triangle around the Warp Pad, levitating the Shooting Star in the center of them.
Garnet says: "Hold it steady."
Garnet says: "We have to send this to the Galaxy Warp without warping ourselves."
Pearl says: "This is too risky."
Amethyst says: "No, it's not."
Amethyst says: "Get over it."
Pearl says: "If the Shooting Star goes off mid-warp, it could explode forever in Warp Space."
Pearl says: "And even if we do manage to destroy the entire Galaxy Warp, they could still find another way to get here."
Steven says: "Uhh, watcha doing'?"
Pearl says: "Steven?!"
Pearl says: "!"
Garnet says: "Pearl!"
Garnet says: "No!"
Pearl loses focus and pulls her hand away in shock. Everyone scream as the Shooting Star stops levitating and touches the warp pad, exploding and destroying the whole place. The blue hypnotizing pattern flashes again.
Trans. Int. Beach House, earlier that day.
Garnet says: "*kisses Steven on the forehead* Mwah."
Steven says: "Uhhhh..."
Steven says: "What?"
Steven says: "Garnet, what happened?"
Garnet says: "I passed my ability to you for just a moment."
Steven says: "You mean..."
Steven says: "I had future visions?"
Garnet says: "Tell me what you saw."
Steven says: "I saw..."
Steven says: "some good things, but mostly bad things."
Garnet says: "And now you can make the right choice."
Steven says: "Hmm!"
Steven says: "Connie, we have to go right this instant."
Trans. Ext. It's a Wash!
Steven and Connie arrive at Greg's car wash, when it begins to snow. Greg is already waiting there by his van.
Greg says: "Would you look at this?"
Greg says: "An entire inch of snow."
Steven says: "Dad, there's no time!"
Steven says: "We got to go now!"
Greg says: "Wha-huh?"
Steven and Connie drags Greg into his van and he starts driving off. The van drives on the road with no hazards, and arrives in front of Connie's house safely. Dr. and Mr. Maheswaran open the house door to greet them as Connie run forth to hug them.
Dr. Maheswaran says: "Connie!"
Dr. Maheswaran says: "Oh, thank goodness you're safe."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "Nice sweatshirt, Greg."
Greg says: "Oh, thanks."
Steven says: "Well, we better get going."
Steven says: "Bye, Connie."
Steven says: "Sorry we can't stay and watch the snow."
Connie says: "Yeah."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "It's starting to get pretty bad out there."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "I don't know if you Universes should be driving in this weather."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "Why don't you both stay here tonight?"
Steven says: "*gasps* Really?!"
Greg says: "*gasps* Really?!"
Steven says: "!"
Greg says: "!"
Connie says: "Wow, Mom."
Connie says: "That's..."
Connie says: "really cool."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "It's..."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "just safer that way."
Dr. Maheswaran says: "We Maheswarans are all about safety."
Mr. Maheswaran says: "I'll make up the couch."
Greg says: "A couch?!"
Greg says: "!"
Greg says: "Ooh là là!"
Greg says: "*runs into the house* Château Maheswaran!"
Steven and Connie look at each other in excitement.
Time Skip — Night time.
Greg is sleeping and snoring on a couch, while Steven sleeps on a different couch. Steven hears footsteps and slowly opens his eyes, noticing Connie standing at the bottom of the stairs. She sneaks over and sits besides Steven's couch, and the pair silently watch the snow fall outside the window.
END.
