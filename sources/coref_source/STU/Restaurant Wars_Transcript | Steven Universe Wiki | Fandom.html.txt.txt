Open Beach Citywalk Fries.
Steven walks up to the shop, silently slamming his fists on the counter, as an unamused Peedee watches.
Steven says: "Give..."
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "me..."
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "the..."
Steven says: "!"
Peedee says: "Just hurry up and say it, Steven."
Steven says: "Mm, Actually..."
Steven says: "what else you got?"
Peedee says: "You could order actual fries."
Steven says: "Nah!"
Steven says: "Let's really try and shake things up today."
Steven says: "I want to order "off-menu"."
Peedee says: "*sighs* You always order off-menu, Steven."
Peedee says: "Let me see what I can find."
Peedee says: "I'll be back in a sec."
Steven says: "I really appreciate it!"
Time-Skip.
Peedee returns enthusiastically back to Steven.
Peedee says: "Steven!"
Peedee says: "Check this out!"
Peedee says: "Boom!"
Peedee puts a tray of mozzarella sticks on the counter.
Steven says: "Mozzarella sticks!"
Steven says: "?"
Steven says: "*picks up the tray*  With all the fixin's?!"
Steven says: "!"
Peedee says: "I can't believe it either!"
Peedee says: "They were way back in the freezer for some reason."
Peedee says: "Feels good to fry something else for a change."
Steven says: "Thanks, Peedee!"
Steven walks down the boardwalk and begins taking a bite out of one of the mozzarella sticks. He passes by Fish Stew Pizza, when Kofi Pizza suddenly bursts out of the door.
Kofi says: "STEVEN!"
Kofi says: "*rushes in front of Steven* What is this!"
Kofi says: "?"
Steven says: "*mouth full of cheese* Um..."
Kofi says: "Bread..."
Kofi says: "Cheese..."
Kofi says: "Marinara sauce!"
Kofi says: "?"
Kofi says: "The basic elements of a pizza!"
Kofi says: "Where did it come from?"
Steven points to Beach Citywalk Fries.
Kofi says: "Fryman..."
Kofi says: "infringing on my business?!"
Kofi says: "!"
Kofi says: "I have been ready for this day!"
Kofi walks back into Fish Stew Pizza and puts up a new sign, that says "Now serving fries".
Steven says: ""Now serving..."
Steven says: "fries"?!"
Steven says: "!"
Mr Fryman then suddenly appears from behind Steven.
Mr. Fryman says: "So..."
Mr. Fryman says: "it begins anew."
Mr. Fryman says: "Eh, Kofi?"
Kofi says: "Just like old times, Fryman."
Mr. Fryman says: "KOFIIIII!"
Kofi says: "FRYMAAAAANN!"
Kofi says: "RES-TAU-RANT WAAAAAAAR!!!!!!"
Mr. Fryman says: "RES-TAU-RANT WAAAAAAAR!!!!!!"
Steven watches in confusion, as the two shouts at each other.
Trans. Beach City Boardwalk.
Some time passes, the boardwalk is seen littered with fries, ketchup, pizza slices and pizza crusts. Several people are also seen outside the two restaurants, murmuring with nausea and discomfort. Steven comes walking in, passing by a shirt shop as a store employee hides in fear and nearly stepping on a person lying face-down on the ground.
Fallen Person says: "Too many carbs..."
Steven cautiously steps over the fallen person and spots a pizza mascot slouching and standing outside Beach Citywalk Fries.
Steven says: "Peedee?"
A saddened Peedee, wearing the pizza costume, turns to Steven.
Peedee says: "Don't look at me, Steven."
Steven says: "But..."
Peedee says: "I SAID, DON'T LOOK AT ME!"
Steven says: "W-What happened?"
Peedee says: "I violated the food treaty."
Steven says: "What do you mean?"
Peedee says: "Years ago, my dad and Kofi signed an agreement to not steal each other's business."
A imaginative scene of a treaty is shown being signed, with Mr. Fryman and Kofi shaking hands.
Peedee says: "But when I fried up those mozzarella sticks, I re-ignited the hot oil of war."
The imaginative scene turns into walls of flames, as Peedee sighs and puts his hand over his face.
Steven says: "*sighs* Don't blame yourself."
Steven says: "I was the one who wanted to "shake things up"."
Peedee says: "Oh, yeah."
Peedee says: "It's your fault."
Mr. Fryman says: "*pops out of the counter* Hey, Steven!"
Mr. Fryman says: "As a valued customer, I want to know your thoughts on a new menu item."
Mr. Fryman says: "Deep-fried pizza!"
Steven says: "A-Actually, could I just get some fries?"
Mr. Fryman says: "Sorry, we're all out of fries."
Steven says: "What?!"
Steven says: "!"
Steven says: "Even the bits?"
Mr. Fryman says: "We have pizza bits now."
Steven says: "But how can you guys be out of fries?"
Steven says: "This is the fry shop!"
Steven says: "You're Fryman!"
Steven says: "Look at your hair."
Mr. Fryman says: "..."
Mr. Fryman says: "What about my hair?"
Steven sweats in awkwardness, when he hears Ronaldo groaning from the back of the shop.
Ronaldo says: "I can't connect to Fish Stew Pizza's wifi."
Mr. Fryman says: "Hey, you got no time for interneting."
Mr. Fryman says: "You're doing deliveries now."
Mr. Fryman takes Ronaldo's laptop and gives him a bag of food to deliver.
Ronaldo says: "But I don't even have a car!"
Mr. Fryman says: "You got those wheelie shoes, don't ya?"
Ronaldo says: "Yeah..."
Ronaldo turns on the wheels at the bottom of his sneakers and skates out of the shop sadly. Steven, looking guilty, walks away and heads into Fish Stew Pizza, where Kiki is taking orders and Jenny is the cashier.
Steven says: "Jenny, you're working the counter?"
Jenny says: "I know right?!"
Jenny says: "!"
Jenny says: "Things have been crazy since the war has been back on!"
Jenny says: "The phones have been ringing off the hook."
Kiki says: "I'll get it!"
Kiki says: "*picks up the phone off-screen* Thanks for calling Fish Stew Pizza."
Kiki says: "We do fries now."
Jenny says: "Anyway, I'm obligated to tell you about our special new menu item."
Jenny says: "*takes out a pen and notepad* French-fried pizza with French-fried crust and twice-baked French fries on the side."
Jenny says: "*sighs* 'Cause we do fries now."
Kofi says: "*pops in and shouts behind Jenny* Steven!"
Steven says: "Oh."
Steven says: "hey, Kofi."
Kofi says: "Before you place your order, you must sign..."
Kofi says: "these papers..."
Kofi says: "*grunts and places out a stack of papers on the counter* And pledge your allegiance to Fish Stew Pizza!"
Kofi says: "Not only that, you'll be issued a brand-new, permanent, V."
Kofi says: "I."
Kofi says: "P."
Kofi says: "pizza-eater card!"
Kofi pulls out a branding iron, reading "VIP" on it, and Steven runs out of Fish Stew Pizza screaming in fear.
Kofi says: "Steven!"
Kofi says: "Come back!"
Mr. Fryman says: "Hey, Steven!"
Mr. Fryman says: "*running towards Steven* Y-You forgot your pizza bits!"
Steven says: "Wha-?"
Steven says: "Aah!"
Kofi says: "Steven!"
Kofi says: "*wielding the branding iron* Let me reward you for being such a good customer!"
Steven says: "*yells and runs away* AAAHH!"
Steven says: "What have I done?!"
Steven says: "!"
Trans. Int. Beach House, Night-time.
Steven gathers Ronaldo, Kiki, Jenny and Peedee in his house.
Steven says: "Thank you all for coming."
Steven says: "Ronaldo..."
Steven says: "Kiki..."
Steven says: "Jenny..."
Steven says: "and Peedee, I've called you all here tonight because..."
Steven says: "*slams his hands on the living room table* This war between your parents has to stop!"
Jenny says: "Steven, how do you think we feel!"
Jenny says: "?"
Jenny says: "Do you know how many metal concerts I've missed because of this war?"
Kiki says: "How many?"
Jenny says: "Mm, like..."
Jenny says: "one?"
Ronaldo says: "Do you know how much blogging I haven't been able to do?!"
Ronaldo says: "!"
Steven says: "I don't, but this is all my fault."
Steven says: "If only my taste buds weren't so adventurous."
Steven says: "I promise to find a way to work this out."
Peedee says: "How?"
Peedee says: "There's no end in sight to all this fighting."
Steven says: "Hmm..."
Steven says: "We need to stop this hate with some sort of..."
Steven says: "opposite of hate."
Steven says: "*gasps* Ronaldo!"
Ronaldo says: "Hmm?"
Steven says: "Kiki!"
Kiki says: "Hmm?"
Steven says: "You're sitting next to each other."
Kiki says: "Where are you going with this, Steven?"
Steven says: "You guys should pretend to be in love!"
Steven says: "There won't be any time for fighting if your families have to plan a wedding together."
Kiki says: "Well..."
Kiki says: "I guess we could try?"
Kiki says: "Anything to get this war over with."
Steven says: "All right!"
Steven says: "We'll fight this war with the power of love!"
Ronaldo says: "No way!"
Ronaldo says: "We can't do this because I..."
Ronaldo says: "have a girlfriend."
Everyone stare intently at Ronaldo.
Jenny says: "Where's she at, though?"
Peedee says: "You said what I was thinking."
Steven says: "Okay, you don't have to pretend to get married."
Steven says: "Just pretend to be in love long enough to get this feud over with."
Ronaldo says: "I..."
Ronaldo says: "got a bad feeling about this!"
Jenny says: "Shut up, Ronaldo!"
Jenny says: "Nothing bad is going to happen."
Jenny says: "*pulls Kiki in for a hug* And you'll get to spend time with the cutest girl in Beach City."
Jenny blows a raspberry on Kiki's cheek as Kiki giggles.
Trans. BC Boardwalk, The Next Day.
Ronaldo and Kiki begin setting Steven's plan in motion.
Ronaldo says: "*holding a banquet of flowers dramatically* Ah, Kiki, my darling."
Kiki says: "Oh, Ronaldo, my sweet."
Ronaldo says: "*runs towards Kiki* My dear, sweet Kiki, who I love with all my blog."
Mr. Fryman says: "*sticks head out of the fry shop window* What the..."
Kiki says: "*giggles* Oh, Ronaldo, you're so sweet and quirky in a way I can tolerate."
Kofi says: "*runs out of the pizzeria door* Kiki, why aren't you in here, working your shift?!"
Kofi says: "!"
Both Mr. Fryman and Kofi approach Ronaldo and Kiki.
Mr. Fryman says: "Yeah, come on, Ronaldo."
Mr. Fryman says: "We got customers to take care of."
Ronaldo says: "But Dad, ever since this war started, I've had to spend countless hours away from my beloved Kiki."
Kofi says: "What?!"
Mr. Fryman says: "What?!"
Kofi says: "!"
Mr. Fryman says: "!"
Kiki says: "It's true."
Kiki says: "The only way for us to be together is if we quit working!"
Steven says: "*from a distance* Are you telling me that you two are involved in a romantic relationship?!"
Steven says: "!"
Ronaldo says: "That's right, Steven."
Ronaldo says: "We have been for some time now."
Kofi says: "*stares at Ronaldo intensively* Mm-hmmm!"
Kofi says: "You two are only hugging, right?"
Ronaldo says: "Uh, yes, sir!"
Ronaldo says: "Just hugs and longing looks."
Mr. Fryman says: "Well, Kofi, love is a beautiful thing."
Kofi says: "Yes, love is beautiful."
Kofi says: "We must end this feud in order for this love to blossom."
Mr. Fryman says: "Yeah!"
Mr. Fryman says: "The restaurant war is officially over!"
Mr. Fryman and Kofi are about to shake hands as the hopeful Peedee, Jenny and Steven watch, when another girl appears with tears in her eyes.
Tearful Girl says: "Ronaldo?"
Tearful Girl says: "I come all this way to return your "Koala Princess" DVDs, only to find you with another girl?"
Jenny says: "*slide in and holds their cheek in surprise* Whaaaaat?!"
Peedee says: "*slide in and holds their cheek in surprise* Whaaaaat?!"
Jenny says: "!"
Peedee says: "!"
Ronaldo says: "Jane, my sweet, this was all just a trick to get my dad to stop selling mozzarella sticks!"
Jane says: "Save it for your blog: Keep Beach City Single!"
Ronaldo says: "Jane, my Ohime-sama- Oof!"
Ronaldo tries to skate after Jane with his wheelie sneakers, but trips and falls flat on his face. Mr. Fryman and Kofi cross their arms and look away from each other in fury.
Kofi says: "The deal is off!"
Mr. Fryman says: "Guh!"
Mr. Fryman says: "Fine by me!"
Mr. Fryman says: "*starts walking away* Peedee, fire up those fryers!"
Kofi says: "*runs off* Kiki, pick up the phone!"
Everyone else sighs.
Ronaldo says: "*still on the ground, whimpers and reaches his hand out* Ja-a-a-ane..."
Trans. Int. Beach House.
Steven, the Pizza kids and the Fryman kids gather back in Steven's house. A heartbroken Ronaldo walks around while texting on his phone while the others mope in the living room.
Jenny says: "Ugh, what are we gonna do?!"
Jenny says: "!"
Steven says: "Hmm..."
Steven says: "Peedee said the last time the war ended because your dad and his dad came together to sign a treaty."
Steven says: "How did that happen?"
Kiki says: "Well, you know where Suitcase Sam's is?"
Kiki says: "It used to be a restaurant called "The Everything Buffet"."
Jenny says: "Oh, yeah!"
Jenny says: "They sold everything!"
Kiki says: "But it wrecked the boardwalk's economy!"
Kiki says: "Not one store could compete."
Kiki says: "But just when everyone thought all hope was lost, our dad and Mr."
Kiki says: "Fryman teamed up and ran them out of town."
Steven says: "Hmm."
Steven says: "Another restaurant eh?"
Steven says: "I think I have a plan."
Trans. Ext. Beach House, Night-time.
The Pizza family and the Fryman family are waiting outside of Steven's house, which has been rebranded as a cardboard sign reading "Steven's". Steven, wearing a waiter uniform, opens the door and steps out.
Steven says: "Welcome to the Grand opening of Steven's."
Steven says: "Right this way."
Steven leads the two families into the house, redecorated into a restaurant with star-shaped light bulbs and candle-lit tables, when Garnet watches on in the kitchen. Mr. Fryman removes his cap as a sign of respect and manners.
Peedee says: "Hmm."
Peedee says: "Nice ambiance."
Mr. Fryman says: "Ahem!"
Mr. Fryman says: "*crosses his hands* It's all right."
Kofi says: "There are not enough tables!"
Kiki says: "There are just enough tables, daddy."
The Frymans take their seats at the closest table, while the Pizzas take their seats at the only other table in the room. Mr. Fryman and Kofi glare at each other when Pearl, dressed up as a waiter too, approaches the Frymans.
Pearl says: "Hello, gentlemen."
Pearl says: "May I take your order?"
Ronaldo says: "I'm full..."
Ronaldo says: "of sadness!"
Mr. Fryman says: "I will have the Fantastic Fries."
Pearl says: "Order taken."
Mr. Fryman says: "*whispers to Peedee* I bet they're not as fantastic as ours."
Pearl says: "And for you?"
Kofi says: "I will have the Pizza Bagel!"
Kofi says: "I doubt a pizza bagel can beat pizza that isn't on a bagel."
Pearl hands Steven the orders.
Steven says: "Ah, let's see."
Steven says: "Wonderful, two of our best dishes!"
Pearl says: "Our only dishes?"
Steven says: "Amethyst, order up!"
Steven says: "Fire one fry and one pizza!"
Amethyst says: "Yes, chef!"
Steven and Amethyst begin preparing the meals together.
Pearl says: "*sets a plate of pizza bagels in front of Kofi* Here's your order, sir."
Kofi says: "Heh, pizza on a bagel, indeed!"
Pearl says: "*sets a plate of neatly-arranged fries in front of Mr."
Pearl says: "Fryman* And for you, sir."
Mr. Fryman says: "Uh, can I get some ketchup?"
Pearl says: "Sorry, no additions or substitutions."
Mr. Fryman says: "Ha!"
Mr. Fryman says: "This place is all talk!"
Mr. Fryman says: "You can't have fries without ketchup."
Mr. Fryman says: "*eats a fry and is suddenly stricken with disbelief* The ketchup..."
Mr. Fryman says: "is inside the fries!"
Mr. Fryman says: "?"
Steven smirks, realizing that he has bested Fryman. Kofi drops his pizza bagel in disbelief too, after taking a bite into it.
Kofi says: "There's cream cheese in this pizza bagel."
Kofi says: "It adds a whole other level of flavor!"
Kofi says: "And with pizza on a bagel, you can eat pizza any time!"
Mr. Fryman says: "It's amazing!"
Kofi says: "It's genius!"
Mr. Fryman and Kofi look at each other and nod in agreement. The two then angrily approach Steven.
Steven says: "Ah, gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed your meal."
Steven says: "Is there something I can help you with?"
Mr. Fryman says: "Steven!"
Mr. Fryman says: "*cracks his knuckles* We didn't want to have to do this, but..."
Kofi says: "*with distress* Please, shut this place down!"
Steven says: "What's this?"
Steven says: "You want me to close my lovely establishment?"
Mr. Fryman says: "*drops to his knees, hands clasped* Steven, we're begging you!"
Kofi says: "*drops to his knees too* We can't compete with a place like this!"
Mr. Fryman says: "You'll drive us out of business!"
Kofi says: "There's already a line!"
Kofi points at the door, where Onion is seen standing outside, fork in hand.
Steven says: "I'll close up shop, under one condition."
Kofi says: "Anything!"
Mr. Fryman says: "Anything!"
Steven says: "Stop this foolish war!"
Steven says: "Cook for yourselves and the good of the boardwalk!"
Steven says: "No more cooking out of hate and spite."
Mr. Fryman and Kofi look at each other and smile.
Kofi says: "Let's just do, what we do best!"
Mr. Fryman says: "Agreed!"
Mr. Fryman and Kofi hug each other.
Peedee says: "Yeah!"
Kiki says: "Yeah!"
 says: "Yeah!"
Jenny says: "Yeah!"
Jenny says: "Good job, daddy."
Mr. Fryman says: "Do you hear that, Ronaldo?"
Mr. Fryman says: "The war's over!"
Ronaldo, still crying face-down on the table, gives a thumbs up.
Steven says: "Glad that's settled."
Steven says: "*turns to the Gems in the kitchen* Y'all help me clean this place up."
Amethyst says: "Sorry."
Amethyst says: "We on break."
The star iris closes on Garnet, who then claps twice, ending the episode.
END.
