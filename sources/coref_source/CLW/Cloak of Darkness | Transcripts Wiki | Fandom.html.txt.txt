Commander Gree says: "Right away, sir."
Commander Gree says: "Let’s move!"

Ahsoka Tano says: "How does a money-grubbing worm like Gunray rate all this security?"
Ahsoka Tano says: "He doesn’t look that dangerous."
Luminara says: "Don’t let your overconfidence give Gunray another advantage, Ahsoka."

Count Dooku says: "I have already put a plan into action, my lord."
Count Dooku says: "My best agent, Asajj Ventress, will infiltrate the Jedi ship and either free Gunray or silence him."
Sidious says: "Ventress?"
Sidious says: "You are putting a great deal of faith in an operative who has failed us in the past."

Dooku says: "She will complete her mission to the letter."

REPUBLIC CRUISER “TRANQUILITY” BRIG.
Captain Argyus says: "How goes the interrogation?"
Captain Argyus says: "Has the Viceroy cracked?"
Commander Gree says: "Not yet."
Commander Gree says: "Neimoidians are a slippery lot, but the Jedi will wear him down."
The interrogation continues inside Nute Gunray’s cell.
Luminara Unduli says: "Your thoughts betray you, Viceroy."
Luminara Unduli says: "I can sense your concern."
Luminara Unduli says: "The fear that you will lose the wealth and the power that the war has given you."
Nute Gunray says: "I have no idea what you’re talking about."
Luminara says: "You hide a great many things."
Luminara says: "The name of your secret allies."
Luminara says: "The locations of their bases."
Gunray says: "I am an innocent pawn in all of this!"
Luminara says: "If you’re merely a pawn, then who are you protecting?"
Gunray says: "No one!"
Gunray says: "I… I know nothing!"
Ahsoka Tano says: "Liar!"
Ahsoka Tano says: "Liar!"
Ahsoka Tano says: "I’m tired of all this whining!"

Luminara says: "Padawan!"
Luminara pulls Ahsoka aside.
Luminara says: "Terror is not a weapon the Jedi use."
Ahsoka says: "I wasn’t serious!"
Ahsoka says: "But the only way he’ll talk is if he’s scared enough."
Gunray says: "Perhaps I was too hasty."
Gunray says: "Let us negotiate."
The cruiser shakes.

Luminara says: "Guard the Viceroy."
Luminara gives her an authoritarian look.
Ahsoka says: "As you wish, Master."
Luminara and Gree leave the brig.
Gunray says: "It appears you are in no position to negotiate after all, Padawan."
Ahsoka says: "Rescue?"
Ahsoka says: "Maybe they’re to make sure you won’t talk."
REPUBLIC CRUISER “TRANQUILITY” LANDING BAY.

Random Clone says: "All units!"
Ventress kills him.
Random Clone says: "Trooper!"
Random Clone says: "What have you found?"
Random Clone says: "Come in, trooper!"

Random Clone says: "Fall back to the detention level!"
Random Clone says: "We have to protect the prisoner!"
REPUBLIC CRUISER “TRANQUILITY” ENGINE ROOM.

Random Clone says: "See anything?"
Random Clone says: "Engine room seems clear."
Random Clone says: "We’ll lock it down."
Random Clone says: "Good, Captain."
Random Clone says: "The enemy is advancing toward the prison level."
Random Clone says: "We’re on our way."
Random Clone says: "You keep watch here, 327."
Random Clone says: "Okay, okay, 327-T."
Random Clone says: "You know droids never like to be called by their nicknames."
They leave the engine room. Ventress manages to set a few detonators without droid 327-T seeing it.
REPUBLIC CRUISER “TRANQUILITY” CORRIDORS.

Commander Gree says: "There."

REPUBLIC CRUISER “TRANQUILITY” BRIG.
Ahsoka Tano says: "Sounds like your rescue didn’t work out after all."
Nute Gunray says: "I am ready to discuss bargain again."
Captain Argyus says: "Padawan Tano."
Captain Argyus says: "May I have a word?"
Ahsoka says: "Certainly, Captain."
Ahsoka says: "If I leave, you won’t go anywhere, will you?"
Gunray ironically laughs.
Argyus says: "I’ve got the all-clear."
Argyus says: "The enemy has been repelled."
Ahsoka says: "And their attempt to free Gunray has failed?"
Asajj Ventress cuts a hole through the entrance. She defeats the Senate commandos.
Ahsoka says: "If it isn’t the hairless harpy."
Asajj Ventress says: "If it isn’t Skywalker’s filthy, obnoxious little pet."
Ahsoka says: "How nice of you."
Ahsoka says: "Tell you what, I’ll give you a merciful death."
The two of them engage into a duel. Luminara Unduli senses Ahsoka’s trouble.
Arguys says: "Shoot her!"
Ventress quickly defeats the whole entire Senate commando.
Ventress says: "Skywalker’s not here to save you now."
Ahsoka says: "Good thing I don’t need saving."
Gunray says: "Over here!"
Gunray says: "Open this door and I’ll buy you a planet!"
Ventress frees Gunray, and Ahsoka gets tricked and is locked inside the cell.
Gunray says: "Yes!"
Gunray says: "Yes!"
Gunray says: "Such delicious irony!"
Gunray says: "How do you like your room now, youngling?"
Luminara Unduli and Commander Gree enter the brig.
Luminara Unduli says: "Halt, assassin!"
Luminara frees Ahsoka and they defeat Ventress.
Luminara says: "Surrender."
Ventress seems to surrender but actually detonates the detonators. She then escapes through the elevator.
Ahsoka says: "What are we waiting for?"
Ahsoka jumps into the elevator.
Luminara says: "Ahsoka!"
Luminara saves Ahsoka from certain death by retaining her and letting the elevator pass.
Ahsoka says: "Thanks."
Arguys says: "Everything’s running haywire."
Arguys says: "Doors, lifts."
Arguys says: "Communication’s down, propulsion’s dead."
Arguys says: "She’s crippled the entire ship."
Luminara says: "Our attacker has come for Gunray."
Luminara says: "Stay here and guard him."
Luminara says: "I’ll confront her myself."
Ahsoka says: "Master, all due respect, but Ventress is too powerful for any one Jedi to fight alone."
Ahsoka says: "Let me help you."
Luminara says: "I am more than capable of dealing with a lone assassin armed with undisciplined fighting skills."
Luminara says: "Stay here, and keep a clear head."
Luminara leaves the brig.
Ahsoka says: "Luminara Unduli may be a Jedi Master, but she has no idea what that bog witch is capable of."
Ahsoka says: "No idea."
Ahsoka says: "I can’t let her face that lowlife alone."
Ahsoka says: "Wouldn’t we have a better chance of stopping her if I helped?"
Arguys says: "Sometimes, being a good soldier means doing what we think is right."
Arguys says: "That’s why we’re superior to droids."
REPUBLIC CRUISER “TRANQUILITY” ENGINE ROOM.
Luminara Unduli and Asajj Ventress have engaged into a duel.
Asajj Ventress says: "Do you think you’ll still be able to call on the Force after I’ve separated your head from your body?"
Luminara Unduli says: "Even with my vision clouded, I recognise the fighting style of Count Dooku."
Luminara Unduli says: "Your version is unrefined."
Luminara Unduli says: "Amateurish."
Luminara Unduli says: "Sloppy."
REPUBLIC CRUISER “TRANQUILITY” BRIG.
Ahsoka Tano says: "I can’t disobey a direct order and leave my post, can I?"
Commander Gree says: "I wouldn’t."
Captain Argyus says: "But don’t worry, we’ve got this under control, Master Jedi."
Captain Argyus says: "Your friend won’t be going anywhere."
Nute Gunray says: "All I know is, I never risk my own skin if I don’t have to."
Ahsoka gives him a weird look.
Gunray says: "What?"
Ahsoka says: "Watch him closely."
Argyus says: "You can trust us, Commander."
Ahsoka leaves.
Gree says: "Call us if you need help, sir!"

Ahsoka Tano says: "You told me to stay."

He shoots his own Senate Commandos and kills them.
Commander Gree says: "Hey!"
Commander Gree says: "What are you doing?"
He engages into a fight with Gree and frees Nute Gunray.
Nute Gunray says: "No."
Nute Gunray says: "Please."
Nute Gunray says: "Don’t!"
Argyus says: "Oh, do shut up."
Argyus says: "Count Dooku is paying me a fortune to deliver your slimy carcass."
Argyus says: "So, please, try to stay alive."
REPUBLIC CRUISER “TRANQUILITY” ENGINE ROOM.
Ahsoka Tano and Luminara Unduli are still looking for Asajj Ventress.
Ahsoka Tano says: "What happened to “Padawan Tano”?"
Luminara says: "This assassin, I’ve never faced an adversary like her."
Luminara says: "I should have listened to your advice."
Luminara receives a call.
Commander Gree says: "General Unduli!"
Commander Gree says: "We’ve been betrayed!"
Commander Gree says: "Argyus has freed Gunray!"
Luminara says: "I’ve been a fool!"
Ventress finally shows herself.
Ahsoka says: "We’ll take her together."
A lightsaber battle starts. Ventress is against Luminara and Ahsoka this time.
REPUBLIC CRUISER “TRANQUILITY” BRIG.
Commander Gree says: "Stop!"
Commander Gree says: "This is your last warning!"
Nute Gunray says: "Don’t shoot!"
Nute Gunray says: "I am an innocent pawn!"
Captain Argyus says: "He won’t shoot."
Captain Argyus says: "He doesn’t want to damage his prize."
Gree shoots on Argyus’ blaster. Argyus has now no weapon, and holds Gunray as a hostage.
Gree says: "Stand down, Captain."
Argyus says: "Come and get me!"
Argyus frees Gunray and starts fighting Gree.
Gree says: "Why’d you do it, Argyus?"
Argyus says: "A clone like you would never understand."
Argyus says: "I wanted a life more than empty servitude."
Gree says: "And for that, you’d betray the Republic?"
Argyus says: "Like I told the Padawan, sometimes being a good soldier means doing what you think is right."
Gree finally defeats Argyus.
Gree is hit by Gunray. He is left unconscious. Argyus gets up.
Gunray says: "You should have taken my offer when you had the chance, clone."
Argyus and Gunray escape and board on a small ship to get away.
Argyus says: "The outer shields are still down."
Argyus says: "The ship is still in turmoil."
Argyus says: "We’re home free."
Argyus and Gunray leave the cruiser.
Argyus says: "As successful a rescue as one could hope for, Viceroy."
Argyus says: "I’ll be a legend for this."
Gunray says: "I always had a good feeling about you, Captain."
On her side, Asajj Ventress has finally managed to escape Luminara Unduli and Ahsoka Tano. She is on the small ship and she enters the cockpit.
Argyus says: "You see, assassin?"
Argyus says: "Our plan went off without a hitch."
Asajj Ventress says: "“Our” plan?"
Argyus says: "And I will, of course, make sure your contributions are noted in my report to Count Dooku."
Ventress kills Argyus.
Ventress says: "I’ll tell him myself."

Ahsoka says: "Thank you, Master."
Luminara says: "Commander, let’s get on the way."
