Narrator says: "The clone war threatens the unity of the Republic!"
Narrator says: "As battles rage across the galaxy, more worlds had come to the seductive lure of the Separatists and leave the Republic."
Narrator says: "On a vital mission of peace, Senator Padme Amidala journeys to Outer Rim world of Rodia, desperate to ensure its loyalty remains to the Republic."
Palpatine says: "Senator Amidala, I just received words that you have ventured through enemy territory into the Outer Rim."
Padme says: "Senator Farr requested me personally, Chancellor."
Padme says: "His planet is in crisis."
Padme says: "His people are starving."
Padme says: "He's a very old family friend."
Padme says: "I could not refuse his plea for help."
Palpatine says: "I understand, but in these dangerous times, you should be accompanied by a clone escort."
Padme says: "This is a mission of peace."
Padme says: "I put my faith in diplomacy."
Padme says: "We can't solve all of our problems by throwing troops at them."
Jar Jar says: "Yousa no needing to worry, Chancellor."
Padme says: "Jar Jar, look out!"
C-3PO says: "What is happening?"
Palpatine says: "May I recommend that only those who are qualified for these delicate peace talks participate in them."
Padme says: "I will follow your advice, Chancellor."
Padme says: "Thank you."
Jar Jar says: "Lookee, lookee, it's a swamp planet just like home."
Jar Jar says: "Meesa have to get going."
Padme says: "Jar Jar, you would be doing me a great favor by staying with the ship."
Jar Jar says: "Meesa knowing meesa be big help with the negotiations."
Padme says: "I need you to watch over 3PO."
Padme says: "You know how he always gets himself into trouble."
C-3PO says: "Trouble, me?"
C-3PO says: "Really."
Padme says: "I won't be long."
Jar Jar says: "Meesa understands, My Lady."
Don't know who this is says: "His Excellency, Ah-Twa."
Padme says: "I've missed you so much."
Onaconda Farr says: "I was afraid you might not come."
Onaconda Farr says: "We are such a small and humble system."
Padme says: "Uncle Ono, you are very important to me."
Padme says: "We've been friends since I was a little girl, when you were my father's strongest ally in the Senate."
Padme says: "Rodia is very important to the Republic, and of course I'd come to help you."
Onaconda Farr says: "You speak of friendship I have not witnessed of late."
Onaconda Farr says: "Where was the Republic when our supply ships were destroyed by pirates?"
Onaconda Farr says: "Where was the Republic as my people starved?"
Onaconda Farr says: "We have been stranded out here without any help at all."
Onaconda Farr says: "I know it is not your fault, but my people starve all the same."
Padme says: "I'm sure the Republic Senate will approve a relief effort."
Padme says: "The vote was postponed, but you will get your food."
Onaconda Farr says: "I am sorry."
Onaconda Farr says: "It is too late, my sweet."
Onaconda Farr says: "The Separatist leader Nute Gunray has promised to support us with a very generous relief effort."
Onaconda Farr says: "He is giving us food, ships, and protection."
Padme says: "Nute Gunray cannot be trusted."
Padme says: "He will bring war to your system just as he did to mine many years ago."
Onaconda Farr says: "I am afraid I have already done what I must for my people."
Padme says: "Viceroy, I should have known."
Gunray says: "You won't get away this time, Senator."
Gunray says: "Your friend made a deal with me, and you are part of it."
Padme says: "3PO, come in, 3PO."
Gunray says: "Stop her."
Gunray says: "No one can help you now."
Onoconda Farr says: "I am so sorry, my sweet."
Onoconda Farr says: "I had no choice."
Padme says: "There's always a choice."
Padme says: "To live in fear is no life at all."
Gunray says: "Take her away."
Padme says: "Please, Uncle Ono, don't do this."
Gunray says: "You have made a wise decision, Senator."
Gunray says: "I will be there within the hour to bring food for your people and collect my prize."
C-3PO says: "How rude."
C-3PO says: "I'm afraid the local swamp life doesn't have a very high opinion of us."
Jar Jar says: "Whaten dey speaking?"
C-3PO says: "I couldn't possibly repeat it."
Jar Jar says: "Theesa swamp dwellers just like meesa."
Jar Jar says: "I will convince them of our good fellowship."
C-3PO says: "Do be careful, Jar Jar."
C-3PO says: "I don't think they're quite like your friends on Naboo."
Jar Jar says: "Meesa make contact."
C-3PO says: "Oh, dear."
C-3PO says: "I don't think that requires translation."
Jar Jar says: "Thisen is a different swamp altogether."
Jar Jar says: "Sorry."
C-3PO says: "Oh, my stars."
C-3PO says: "Battle droids."
Jar Jar says: "Weesa in trouble now."
Battle Droid says: "Stop where you are."
C-3PO says: "Wait for me!"
C-3PO says: "Jar Jar, you great webfoot, you're squashing my circuits."
Battle Droid says: "Blast 'em."
C-3PO says: "Wait, where are you going?"
C-3PO says: "Oh, no."
C-3PO says: "I'll be crushed for sure."
Jar Jar says: "Hang on, Three-so!"
C-3PO says: "It's 3PO."
C-3PO says: "That was close."
C-3PO says: "What are you doing?"
C-3PO says: "Get me down at once."
Padme says: "It's not too late."
Padme says: "Uncle Ono, you can stop this madness."
Battle Droid says: "Keep moving, prisoner."
C-3PO says: "Look out, Jar Jar."
C-3PO says: "A crab droid is headed right for you."
Jar Jar says: "Headed for meesa?"
C-3PO says: "Yes, yousa!"
C-3PO says: "No, Jar Jar, go to your left."
C-3PO says: "Behind you."
C-3PO says: "Watch out."
C-3PO says: "I can't bear to watch."
C-3PO says: "Oh, no."
C-3PO says: "Jar Jar's been killed."
C-3PO says: "I knew something like this would happen."
C-3PO says: "What a horrible way to die, and it's all my fault."
C-3PO says: "He was so brave."
C-3PO says: "Now he's gone forever."
Jar Jar says: "Meesa okay."
C-3PO says: "Jar Jar, you're alive."
Jar Jar says: "Meesa okay, Three-so."
Jar Jar says: "Meesa okay."
C-3PO says: "If you've finished messing around, I need help."
C-3PO says: "Jar Jar, kindly don't do that."
Jar Jar says: "But meesa save-ed you."
C-3PO says: "That's the end of our ship."
C-3PO says: "Typical."
Onoconda Farr says: "Are those chains necessary?"
Padme says: "Welcome to the separatist way, Senator."
Battle Droid says: "Viceroy Gunray's orders."
Padme says: "I hope it's worth it to you."
Jar Jar says: "Thisa one big mess."
Jar Jar says: "Weesa going nowhere."
C-3PO says: "Perhaps we should try to contact the clone troopers."
Jar Jar says: "Lookee."
Jar Jar says: "Here's a button that's still working."
C-3PO says: "What did you break now?"
Jar Jar says: "Meesa doing nothing."
Jar Jar says: "Thatsa looken like a Jedi robe."
Jar Jar says: "Whosa you supos'n this belongs to?"
C-3PO says: "I wouldn't know."
C-3PO says: "But our only hope is to hide in this closet until Mistress Padme returns."
Jar Jar says: "If those droids attacking us, Padme's probably in trouble."
C-3PO says: "My Lady gave us very specific instructions to remain here."
Jar Jar says: "Fiddlesticks."
Jar Jar says: "We musta hafta try and saving her."
C-3PO says: "Jar Jar Binks, have you gone completely mad?"
C-3PO says: "You'll do more harm than good."
Onoconda Farr says: "Good."
Onoconda Farr says: "I shall meet the Viceroy when he lands."
Onoconda Farr says: "What about Senator Amidala's companions?"
Onoconda Farr says: "If there are no signs of her friends, they must have fled into the jungle."
Onoconda Farr says: "Yes, this is perfect."
Onoconda Farr says: "I want no sign of trouble."
Onoconda Farr says: "Our people need those supplies."
Jar Jar says: "Wait."
Jar Jar says: "Meesa eyeball's stuck in the sleeve."
C-3PO says: "Just look at you."
Jar Jar says: "Something's wrongo here."
C-3PO says: "The battle droids will surely capture you, or worse, me."
Jar Jar says: "Not with thisa on."
Jar Jar says: "Theysa won't be recognizing me."
C-3PO says: "You can't be serious."
Jar Jar says: "Come on, Three-so, we can do it."
C-3PO says: "I have a very bad feeling about this."
Ono says: "The citizens of Rodia welcome you, Viceroy."
Gunray says: "Where is Senator Amidala?"
Ono says: "Awaiting your arrival as promised."
Gunray says: "Excellent."
Gunray says: "I do not wish to keep her waiting."
Gunray says: "Shall we go?"
Ono says: "We are holding the Senator in the detention tower."
Gunray says: "I hope it is not too painful for her."
Jar Jar says: "Sheesa up in that tower?"
Jar Jar says: "Weesa got to rescuing her."
C-3PO says: "And how precisely do you propose to do that?"
Battle Droid says: "Look, a Jedi."
C-3PO says: "We're doomed."
Gunray says: "A Jedi?"
Jar Jar says: "Jedi?"
Jar Jar says: "Where's a Jedi?"
C-3PO says: "I do believe they mean you."
Jar Jar says: "Meesa not a Jedi."
Battle Droid says: "Kill the Jedi."
C-3PO says: "Don't shoot."
C-3PO says: "We surrender!"
Jar Jar says: "Forget surrender!"
Jar Jar says: "Weesa run!"
Gunray says: "Is he dead?"
Battle Droid says: "The Jedi got away."
Battle Droid says: "He slipped through this grate and went underwater."
Gunray says: "Sound the alarm!"
Gunray says: "Find that Jedi!"
C-3PO says: "I can see your busy, so I'll just be going now."
Gunray says: "And take that Republic droid scum to the dismantling center."
C-3PO says: "Dismantling center?"
C-3PO says: "Wait, wait."
C-3PO says: "I'm innocent."
C-3PO says: "I'm innocent, I tell you."
Battle Droid says: "Let's find that Jedi."
Battle Droids says: "Roger, roger."
Gunray says: "Take me to Senator Amidala at once!"
Jar Jar says: "There's a bad boogie monster down there, you betcha."
Jar Jar says: "Don't be fearing, Padme."
Jar Jar says: "Meesa coming."
Battle Droid says: "Better watch out."
Battle Droid says: "There's a Jedi on the loose."
Padme says: "You know, you will soon be destroyed."
Padme says: "I can't tell you how many times I've seen battle droids sliced in half by a lone Jedi."
Battle Droid says: "Quiet you."
Battle Droid says: "All right, cut the chatter."
Battle Droid says: "I want you troops to go outside and secure the perimeter."
Padme says: "You made it."
Padme says: "I'm rescued at last."
Padme says: "Hurry before the battle droids figure out what's happening."
Battle Droid says: "Quiet in there!"
Padme says: "Thank you."
Padme says: "Let's get out of here, Master Jedi."
Battle Droid says: "Jedi?"
Battle Droid says: "There's no Jedi in here."
Battle Droid says: "Wait, there's no prisoner in here."
Battle Droid says: "How did she do that?"
Battle Droid says: "Where's the alarm button?"
Battle Droid says: "Quiet."
C-3PO says: "Mistress Padme."
C-3PO says: "Thank The Maker you're safe."
Padme says: "Where's Jar Jar?"
C-3PO says: "I'm afraid he went to rescue you."
Padme says: "What about the Jedi?"
C-3PO says: "There is no Jedi."
C-3PO says: "It appears the battle droids have mistaken Jar Jar for one."
Padme says: "That's not good."
Jar Jar says: "Hang on, My Lady."
Padme says: "This is our chance to capture Viceroy Gunray, but I need you to stay calm."
Padme says: "Go back to the ship and call for help."
C-3PO says: "I regret the transmitters on the ship are out of order."
Padme says: "What?"
C-3PO says: "The ship has been destroyed."
Padme says: "Battle droids?"
Padme says: "All right, then find a communications room and send out a distress signal."
Padme says: "Hopefully there're some clone ships within range."
Padme says: "I'll track down Jar Jar."
Ono says: "Viceroy Gunray, when can we expect the supplies to arrive?"
Ono says: "My people are starving."
Gunray says: "They haven't arrived yet?"
Gunray says: "I'm sorry."
Gunray says: "Your request will be taken into consideration after Senator Amidala's execution."
Ono says: "Execution?"
Ono says: "You can't."
Ono says: "She's a prisoner of war."
Ono says: "We were promised."
Gunray says: "You are under my protection now, and you will do what I demand of you."
Ono says: "Padme was right."
Ono says: "I have made a grave mistake joining with the separatists."
Ono says: "I know, I know."
Ono says: "We must appease Viceroy Gunray so he does not destroy us all."
Ono says: "Be on alert for that Jedi, He is our only hope."
Gunray says: "Bring Senator Amidala before me."
Battle Droid says: "She caused a great deal of damage to our droids, and she escaped, sir."
Jar Jar says: "Escaped?"
Battle Droid says: "It's the Jedi!"
Gunray says: "Shoot him!"
Jar Jar says: "Thisa rescuing is hard jobbing."
Battle Droid says: "Capture her!"
C-3PO says: "Oh, dear."
C-3PO says: "The Jedi has been spotted in the south hall."
Battle Droid says: "Let's move."
Other Battle Droid says: "Roger, roger."
C-3PO says: "I think that was rather clever."
Battle Droid says: "Sir, over there!"
Battle Droid says: "The Jedi is escaping."
Big Battle Droid says: "Not likely."
Battle Droid says: "Freeze."
Battle Droid says: "Surrender."
Battle Droid says: "Where did she go?"
Gunray says: "Senator Amidala."
Gunray says: "So good to see you at last."
C-3PO says: "Hello?"
C-3PO says: "I say, is anyone there?"
C-3PO says: "Why is there never an R2 unit when you need one?"
Clone Trooper says: "This is a restricted frequency."
Clone Trooper says: "Who is this?"
C-3PO says: "I am C-3PO, human-cyborg No droids."
Clone Trooper says: "This code is for military use only."
C-3PO says: "This is a priority message from Senator Amidala on Rodia."
Battle Droid says: "Hold it."
C-3PO says: "Oh, dear."
Battle Droid says: "You're under arrest."
C-3PO says: "So you didn't find the Jedi, then?"
Battle Droid says: "You got him, boss."
Battle Droid says: "Too bad you can't take out that slug monster."
Jar Jar says: "Yousa okay, bogey?"
Jar Jar says: "Yousa save-ed me."
Jar Jar says: "Yousa my new palo."
C-3PO says: "Mistress Padme, where you able to find Jar Jar?"
Padme says: "I think Jar Jar's dead, 3PO."
C-3PO says: "Not again."
C-3PO says: "Oh, poor Jar Jar."
C-3PO says: "He was always such a misfit."
Gunray says: "I want to make sure this time."
Ono says: "Don't do this, Viceroy."
Ono says: "I beg you, do not kill her."
Ono says: "There must be another way."
Gunray says: "Silence!"
C-3PO says: "I say, I think there has been some horrible mistake."
Gunray says: "Ready."
Gunray says: "Aim."
Ono says: "It's the Jedi!"
Padme says: "Jedi."
Jar Jar says: "Release the Senator."
Battle Droid says: "That Jedi is going to attack."
Gunray says: "Shoot him!"
Gunray says: "Shoot them all!"
Gunray says: "That Jedi has summoned a monster."
Gunray says: "We have to get out of here."
Jar Jar says: "I made a very good friend."
Padme says: "Hold it right there, Viceroy."
Ono says: "At last we can finish this."
Gunray says: "Onaconda, it is about time."
Gunray says: "Blast that Jedi and shoot her!"
Padme says: "Uncle Ono, I think it's time to tell the Viceroy about our little secret, how you never meant to leave the Republic and how you truly care what's best for your people."
Gunray says: "What is she talking about?"
Ono says: "Sorry, Viceroy, she is right."
Ono says: "I am with the Republic, and you are under arrest."
Gunray says: "You will pay for this treachery."
Padme says: "Viceroy, you are going to spend the rest of the war in a cell."
Gunray says: "Your victory will be fleeting, Senators."
C-3PO says: "Those are Republic warships."
C-3PO says: "The clones have arrived."
Clone Trooper says: "We got your message, general."
Clone Trooper says: "What are your orders?"
C-3PO says: "My message got through."
Ono says: "Take this separatist scum away."
Ono says: "Master Bombad, on behalf of the people of Rodia, I thank you."
Ono says: "You're either the bravest or the most foolish Jedi I have ever met."
Jar Jar says: "I'm just a gungan, and I don't think I'm either."
C-3PO says: "Well, I think you're a little bit of both."
Palpatine says: "Senator Amidala has brought your people's needs to my attention, and I have already sent a convoy of supply ships to your system."
Ono says: "Thank you, Chancellor."
Palpatine says: "The capture of Viceroy Gunray is a major victory for the Republic."
Palpatine says: "All of you should be commended for your courage, and from what I hear, especially you representative Binks."
Jar Jar says: "Ah, it'sa nothing."
Ono says: "Can you ever forgive me, Padme?"
Ono says: "It is the Republic that should be asking your forgiveness, my old friend."
Ono says: "Far too often, we forget that our most important allies are not always the most powerful."
