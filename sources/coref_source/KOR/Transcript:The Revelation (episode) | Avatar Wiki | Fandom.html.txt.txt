Mako says: "Deal with it."

She aggressively tosses the ball back to Mako. Switch to a side shot as the ball hits him hard in the stomach, flinging him backward in a flip, and causing him to land hard on his back, groaning. Frontal shot of a smug-looking Korra, who is crossing her arms. She glances over her shoulder and the scene pans to the right revealing someone has entered the gym.
Butakha says: "There are my little hard-working street urchins."
Butakha says: "It's an honor to finally meet you, Avatar."
Korra says: "And you are..."
Korra says: "?"
Butakha says: "and a personal loan for groceries."
Mako stares sadly at his empty hand and turns to a dismayed expression. He turns to the screen irritatedly. He turns and glares accusingly at Bolin. Switch to broader shot of the two brothers. Pabu is perched on Bolin's shoulders.
Bolin says: "I'm a growing boy!"
Butakha says: "Oh, and one more small item of business: The Fire Ferrets need to ante up thirty thousand yuans for the championship pot."
Butakha says: "Sorry, kids."
Butakha says: "You got 'til the end of the week to come up with the dough, or else, you're out of the tournament."
Bolin feebly reaches after Butakha as he walks away. Korra walks up to them as both brothers look at the ground with sad expressions. They glance to her as she stops.
Bolin says: "You wouldn't happen to have a secret Avatar bank account overflowing with gold, would you?"
Korra says: "I've always had people taking care of me."
Mako says: "Then I wouldn't say you have nothing."
Korra says: "Sorry, I didn't mean—"
Bolin says: "ever since we lost our parents, we've been on our own."
Korra says: "I'm so sorry."
Korra says: "I didn't know."
Mako says: "how are we gonna come up with the money?"
Bolin says: "I've been training Pabu to do circus tricks."
Bolin says: "Now people would pay good money to see that!"
Wider shot of the three teenagers. Bolin excitedly and hopefully looks at Mako, while both Mako and Korra look down at Bolin with a "you cannot be serious" expression.
Mako says: "We need serious ideas."
Bolin says: "I was serious."
Mako says: "Don't worry about it."
Mako says: "I'll figure something out."
Mako says: "I always do."
Bolin stands up and both he and Korra eye Mako's exit with a wondering expression. Scene zooms in on Bolin, whose look changes to a determined one as he glances to the side.
Cut to Central City Station. The scene pans down Fire Lord Zuko's statue to reveal someone sitting at its base while people are passing him by.

Shady Shin says: "Hey, Bolin."
Shady Shin says: "Is that you?"
Bolin says: "Oh, hey there, Shady Shin."
Shady Shin says: "Heard you're a big time pro-bending player now."
Shady Shin says: "Not bad."
Bolin says: "Uh, thanks."
Shady Shin says: "So listen."
Shady Shin says: "I got an offer for ya."
Shady Shin says: "Lightning Bolt Zolt is lookin' to hire some extra muscle."
Bolin says: "Uh, I don't know, Shin."
Bolin says: "Mako told me to stay away from the Triple Threats."
Shady Shin says: "It's just a little security work."
Shady Shin says: "Nothin' crooked."
Shady Shin reaches in his pocket, takes out a wad of cash, and tosses it into Bolin's cup. A shot from inside the can looking up shows Bolin staring at the money with wide eyes and gasps in awe. He shakes his head and gasps even louder, while nearly sticking his head in the can.

Switch to a broader site shot to reveal that there are at least six firebenders standing next to each other and generating lightning to shoot at the coil in front of them.

The two sisters smile at her before suddenly leaning a bit to their left to look behind her. Scene switches to show that Mako is approaching.
Jinora says: "handsome firebender boy that drives you crazy?"
Frontal shot of a still bend over and panting Korra with Mako approaching behind her. She looks wide-eyed at the girls, glances back, and sees Mako.

Korra says: "Ahem."
Korra says: "Oh."
Korra says: "Hey, Mako."
Mako says: "You seen Bolin?"
Korra says: "I haven't seen him since practice."
Korra says: "Think something's wrong?"
Mako says: "See you later."
Korra briefly glances down, but quickly raises her hand as she calls after Mako.
Korra says: "Wait."
Korra says: "I could, uh..."
Korra says: "help you look for him."
Mako says: "Nah."

Side shot of Mako and Skoochy, who holds out a casual, but suggestive hand, asking silently for money.
Mako says: "Humph, a real pro."
Mako digs into his back pocket and retrieves a yuan bill. He hands it to Skoochy, who immediately puts it away in the inner pocket of his jacket. The entire scene is eyed by a shocked and disapproving Korra.
Skoochy says: "Yeah, I seen him."
Mako says: "When?"
Skoochy says: "About noon."
Mako says: "What was he doing?"
Skoochy says: "H-he was performing  some kind of monkey rat circus."

Korra says: "What's he talking about?"
Mako says: "And Bolin's about to get caught right in the middle of it."

Korra says: "So where're we headed?"
Mako says: "The Triple Threat Triad's headquarters."
Mako says: "Hopefully Bolin's there and nothing's gone down yet."
Korra says: "The Triple Threat Triad?"
Korra says: "I beat up some of those yahoos when I got into town."
Korra says: "Why would Bolin get tangled up wit—"
The rest of Korra's sentence is cut off when Naga suddenly shoot forward. Cut to a frontal shot as the polar bear dog dashes through the street, taking a sharp right turn in pursuit of a running fire ferret.

As he slinks back into the shadows, Korra casually strolls toward the door, forsaking any sneaking up. Switch to inside the room to a shot of the front door as the double doors are being kicked out of their hinges by Korra. The small party enters the empty room, looking around. The building is strangely empty and the furniture is broken.
Mako says: "Bolin?"
Mako says: "You in here?"
A truck's engine roars outside and Korra and Mako promptly run out the back. As they crash through the door, they're just in time to witness a truck and five motorcycles drive off.

Camera pans up to show a masked individual who closes the doors. Cut back to a side shot of a shocked-looking Mako and Korra who run after the strangers.
Mako says: "Bolin!"
As Mako and Korra run after the vehicles, the camera cuts to two masked figures on motorcycles who pull out smoke grenades and toss them at the incoming duo. Scene shifts to a frontal shot of Mako and Korra as the grenades explode with a bright flash and produce thick, heavy, green smoke, effectively halting their pursuit for some seconds. Cut to a broader shot. The masked figures take notice of the grenades effects and drive of with screeching tires. An aerial shot reveals how they quickly pull away and turn a corner, smoke in their trail. Cut back to Mako and Korra, coughing heavily amidst the smoke, covering their mouths.
Korra says: "Naga, come!"
Korra starts running in the direction the motorcyclists took off in, Naga racing across the camera after her. As she passes, Mako starts to run after them as well.

They look up and the scene switches to the two masked motorcyclists, who elegantly twist in the air to land at opposite sides of Mako and Korra to fight them, who at this point, have gotten up. The female rider wastes no time and runs for Korra, who ignites her right fist and sends a large fire blast at the incoming attacker.

Side shot as she initiates a hand-to-hand combat with Korra. The chi blocker aims for Korra's head, but the Avatar averts the course with her left hand. She retaliates with a fire blast, which her opponent ducks under. The camera rapidly turns around them when the chi blocker locks arms with Korra. The Avatar throws another fire punch with her left hand, but the chi blocker leans back to dodge it, knocking Korra's hand to the side. Korra uses her sideways moment to spin around in a full moon fire kick, though the masked fighter evades the blast by moving to her left. Camera turns again and stops at a side shot when Korra aims a high fire kick at the chi blocker's head, who reciprocates that move and curls her leg around the Avatar's and pulls it down, creating an unguarded opening to Korra's right side. She delivers about four punches to the Avatar's side and arm and backs away. Frontal shot as Korra staggers with a grunt, as her right side has gone numb. She grabs hold of her right arm with her left one, her eye big in wonder about what just happened to her.

Korra aims two more fire blasts at her attacker, but to no avail as she dodges.

The camera pans to the left to reveal her male counterpart performing the same action. Cut to a close shot of a wide-eyed Korra, before switching back to their incoming aggressors. As one of the masked figures prepares to throw the bola, his concentration is broken by a loud growl and he looks to his right.

Korra says: "Amon?"
Korra says: "That anti-bending guy with a mask?"
Mako says: "Yeah, he's the leader of the Equalists."

Korra says: "Mako,  I promise you that."

Mako says: "But where?"
They both turn in another direction, eyes closed in disappointment. Suddenly, Korra erects herself and her eyes spring open.
Korra says: "Huh!"
Korra says: "I have an idea!"
With a determined look on her face, she pulls Naga's reins and they start moving again.

Korra says: "It's our only lead right now."
Fade to a slowly panning to the right shot. Korra and Mako are sitting with their backs against Naga's side; the polar bear dog is resting underneath a tree at the side of the fountain. Cut to a close-up; Pabu is asleep atop Naga's saddle, Mako has his eyes closed and arms crossed, and Korra is looking around, slightly uncomfortable. Eventually, she turns to Mako.
Korra says: "So, why is Bolin running around with the Triple Threat Triad, anyway?"
Mako says: "Well, we..."
Mako says: "we used to do some work for them back in the day."
Korra says: "What?"
Korra says: "Wha- Are you some kind of criminal?"
Mako says: "No!"
Mako says: "You don't know what you're talking about."
Mako says: "I just ran numbers for them and stuff."

Protester says: "We want equality now!"
As the duo slowly opens their eyes, they notice that they are close against each other. As the reality of that fact sinks in, both their eyes shoot open in horror. Korra lets out a horrified gasp and they scramble away from each other out of embarrassment.
Korra says: "I-I..."
Korra says: "er..."
Korra says: "eheh, humn, hmmehem."
Korra smiles awkwardly at Mako who stares back at her. They turn their attention in wonder in the direction of the sound that woke them up.
Protester says: "Nonbenders of Republic City..."
Korra says: "That's the guy."
The camera quickly zooms toward the protester, stopping at a close-up.
Protester says: "Amon calls you to action!"

Korra cracks an innocent grin. Switch to a ground back-shot of the doorman as he takes out a wrench. Cut to Korra's eyes, which have switched from a look of faked innocence to a look of focus. Close-up of the wrench being twirled around in the doorman's hand, before switching to a broad shot of the hallway as the man attacks Korra. She nimbly ducks under his swing, and evades his next attack, coming up behind him. He turns around and aims an overhead swing at her, but Korra evades it again, making him hit the pipes.
Cut to a back shot of Mako in the crowd, watching Amon remove another bender's bending. He turns to his left, looking to where Korra disappeared to.
Mako says: "Come on..."
Cut back to Korra as she ducks underneath another violent swing of the doorman's wrench that hits the pipes instead, denting them. Close-up of a now hatless Korra who takes off Mako's scarf and uses it to tie around the doorman's hand as he aimed another swing at her. Wider shot as Korra uses the scarf to pull the man into a turn, flinging his entire body into the machine, knocking off all the vents that were holding down the steam. Through three open pipes, steam pores out and fills the room. Ground, frontal shot as Korra looks at the steam.
Korra says: "Thanks."
Korra says: "This should be enough."
She runs forward to the camera.
Cut to a frightened Bolin as an Equalist guard moves toward him. As the Equalist start to fumble at his ropes, Bolin anxiously looks back, whimpering softly. Once he is free, he is pulled on his feet and thrown forward. Switch to a back-shot as he stumbles forward on the stage while the bender Amon just took care of slumps down in exhaustion. Close-up of Amon as he slowly turns around under loud cheering of the crowd. Cut back to a frontal shot of Bolin, who has the fingertips of his hands pressed together as he addresses Amon.
Bolin says: "I think there's been a big misunderstanding."
Amon moves forward and Bolin slightly backs up.
Cut to Korra, waterbending the steam behind her, a focused look on her face. The moment she has enough, she directs it all in front of her with a powerful swipe of her hand. Cut to a back-shot of Bolin. An explosion to his left makes him duck for cover; under loud screams of the crows, steam starts to pour in to the meeting room. Quick frontal shot of a shocked Bolin as he looks at what is going on. Switch to an overview shot of the room from behind the stage, steam engulfing everything in its path, clouding everyone and everything. Cut to a back-shot of several civilians backing up from the incoming steam, turning around and making a break for it. Cut to a shot of Amon standing amidst the steam; he backs away, vanishing completely. Switch to Bolin who is looking around him, a focused look on his face. He slowly backs up, but is grabbed from behind by an Equalist, much to Bolin's shock. Mako emerges out of the steam from behind the Equalist, grabs hold of him, and throws him away over his shoulder. Switch to a wide side shot as the Equalist is flung far away from the brothers. Cut to a frontal shot of Mako and Bolin as Mako turns to his brother.
Mako says: "Bolin, you all right?"
Bolin says: "Yes!"
Bolin says: "Mako!"
Bolin says: "I love you!"
As Bolin moves forward in an attempt to hug his brother, Mako seizes him around his neck and drags him off into the steam. Cut to a side shot of outside the factory where a door is being flung open, scaring off several birds. The two brothers emerge from the balcony exit and run over to a ladder; switch to a ground shot as they start descending it, Bolin being the first. An aerial shot of the balcony shows another person emerging from the door and running over to the ladder. Brief frontal shot of Mako looking up changes to a ground shot from his point of view to show an Equalist fighter, the Lieutenant, twirling his kali sticks and slamming them into the ladder, sending an electricity charge through it. Mako and Bolin scream in shock and pain and fall down, landing with grunts. The Lieutenant jumps down from the balcony, his kali stick charged. A far off side shot shows that he lands and immediately releases the charge, forcing the brothers to jump away. Frontal shot of first Bolin, followed by Mako, as they erect themselves, having pushed themselves out of the way of the Lieutenant's attack. Mako raises his fist and goes on the offensive, launching a fire jet at the crouched Lieutenant from his left fist. Frontal shot of the Equalist as he runs off to avoid the blast. He attacks Mako with his kali sticks, electricity trailing behind them as he rapidly swings them around. With a few fast hits, Mako is floored, and the Lieutenant turns to Bolin.
Switch to a back-shot of the Lieutenant. Bolin flips over and uses his own momentum to hurl a slap of earth at the Lieutenant with a grunt of focus, who jumps up, twirling out of its path. He does a similar evasive maneuver to avoid the second block a grunting Bolin threw at him, before charging the earthbender. Frontal shot of an alarmed-looking Bolin; switch to a back-shot of him as he conjures up a large earth wall to protect himself. The Lieutenant performs a round off, before back flipping and somersaulting over Bolin's wall. He lands behind a shocked Bolin, who quickly turns to face him, and after delivering several quick hits with his charged kali sticks, the Lieutenant jabs him with the two electrified kali sticks and electroshocks him until he falls to the ground unconscious.
Suddenly, Mako emerges from beside the wall, using the adjacent building to push himself off in the Lieutenant's direction, sending a fire slice in his direction. The Lieutenant dodges, and Mako kicks out another fire slice while grunting in effort, knocking over Bolin's wall with his attack. The Lieutenant charges Mako again and after a quick exchange of some blows striking air from both parties, the Lieutenant lands a hit with a kali stack in Mako's stomach, flinging him back with a grunt of pain. As Mako is pushed up against the wall, the Lieutenant charges and twirls both his weapon sticks and jabs Mako's chest, electroshocking him into unconsciousness. Wider shot as Mako slumps onto the ground as well; the Lieutenant is looking at Bolin's unconscious form.
Lieutenant says: "You benders need to understand, there's no place in the world for you anymore."
A pillar of rock shoots up beside the Lieutenant and thrusts him brutally against the building. He slams hard against the metal, his two kali sticks are knocked out of his hands, and he falls down onto the ground. As he tries to get up, the camera switches to his point of view to show Korra standing there in an earthbending pose.
Korra says: "I wouldn't count us out just yet."
Korra says: "Naga!"
Naga barks and immediately comes running from behind a building, jumping down the last of the ramp. Korra walks over to Mako as he struggles to get up and helps him to his feet. Overview shot of the alley as more Equalist fighters storm the area from the balcony. Korra and Mako ascend on to Naga. Frontal shot of Bolin who sits up, slightly dazed, though he screams in fright and moved his hands protectively before him as he looks up. Side shot as Naga runs up, grabbing Bolin with her teeth by his collar and drags him off.
Bolin says: "Hah..."
Bolin says: "Oh..."
Bolin says: "Yah..."
Bolin says: "Stop..."
Bolin says: "I want..."
Bolin says: "to be..."
Bolin says: "on..."
Bolin says: "your back..."
Bolin says: "please!"
Lieutenant says: "The Avatar."
Lieutenant says: "That's her!"
Several Equalists immediately run after them. The shot moves up, revealing Amon standing on the balcony, overlooking the situation, his hands folded casually behind his back.
Amon says: "Let her go."
Amon says: "She's the perfect messenger to tell the city of my power."
Cut to a moon in the sky beside the tower on Air Temple Island. The shot pans down, leveling with Tenzin and two White Lotus sentries. Switch to a close-up of the threesome; they turn at Korra who is approaching them. Tenzin moves to meet her.
Tenzin says: "Thank goodness."
Tenzin says: "Korra, what happened?"
Tenzin says: "Did you find your friend?"
Korra says: "I saw Amon."
Tenzin says: "What?"
Korra says: "For good."
Tenzin says: "that's impossible."
Tenzin says: "Only the Avatar has ever possessed that ability."
Korra says: "But I saw him do it."
Tenzin says: "No bender is safe."
