Catra says: "Entrapta was a traitor."
Catra says: "What else is there to know?"
Hordak says: "I trusted you."
Hordak says: "Your days were numbered the moment you crossed me."
Hordak says: "And after I'm through, you can't even begin to imagine the punishments Horde Prime will inflict upon you."
Catra says: "Oh, because he's going to swoop down and fix everything for you at any moment, right?"
Catra says: "You're lying to yourself now."
Catra says: "Why would Horde Prime care about you?"
Catra says: "You're a defect, a mistake."
Catra says: "Haven't you noticed?"
Catra says: "I'm running things here."
Catra says: "Now we can finally end this."
Catra says: "I didn't need Entrapta."

Double Trouble says: "You know, it took me a while, but I finally figured out your character."
Catra* says: "You try so hard to play the big, bad villain, but your heart's never been in it, has it?"
Catra says: "What--?"
Catra says: "What are you?"
Catra says: "Stop."
Catra says: "Stop it."

Adora* says: "Didn't need you."
Adora* says: "Left you."
Double Trouble says: "But did you ever stop to think maybe they're not the problem?"
Scorpia* says: "It's you."
Scorpia* says: "You drive them away, wildcat."
Catra says: "Why are you doing this?"
Double Trouble says: "It's for your own good, darling."
Double Trouble says: "We both know this was never what you really wanted."
Double Trouble says: "But it was also a good distraction."
Double Trouble says: "Your army was ambushed on their way to defenseless Bright Moon."
Double Trouble says: "Your face right now is almost better than applause."
Double Trouble says: "Almost."
Catra says: "You betrayed me."
Double Trouble says: "It's not personal, darling."

Double Trouble says: "The best way to survive is always choose the winning side."
Double Trouble says: "The Rebels have some kind of ancient superweapon."
Double Trouble says: "Any minute now, they're going to use it, and when they do..."

Light Hope says: "That is why I used all my strength to reach across the entire universe to find you and bring you here."
Adora says: "You told me Hordak was the one who brought me through the portal."
Adora says: "You told me he stole me."
Adora says: "But it was you all along."
Adora says: "All of this is because of you."
Light Hope says: "This is your intended function."
Light Hope says: "You will bring the First Ones to glory."
Light Hope says: "It is what you were born to do."
Adora says: "No."
Adora says: "No, I won't."
Light Hope says: "The Heart of Etheria has been activated."
Light Hope says: "You will be the one to fire it."
Light Hope says: "There is no stopping it now."

Light Hope says: "She turned against her people."
Adora says: "Mara was your friend."
Adora says: "She knew you were more than just a program, and so do I."
Adora says: "You can stop this."
Light Hope says: "I am not as strong as Mara."
Light Hope says: "I cannot change my programming."
Light Hope says: "This is our destiny."
Adora says: "No."
Adora says: "This is not my destiny."
Light Hope says: "You will comply."
Adora says: "No, no, no."

Hordak says: "But it has not been in vain."
Hordak says: "I have built an empire in your name."
Horde Prime says: "I received your transmission, but I could not determine its source."
Horde Prime says: "Until I detected an energy reading like nothing I have ever seen before."
Horde Prime says: "And when I arrived, this curious planet had appeared."
Hordak says: "I conquered this world for you."
Hordak says: "To show you that I am worthy, so that I may retake my place by your side."

Horde Prime says: "To your will."
Horde Prime says: "Why can I not see your thoughts?"
Horde Prime says: "I see now."
Horde Prime says: "You have given yourself a name."
Horde Prime says: "You tried to create an empire of your own."
Horde Prime says: "There was even a time you wished I would not come for you, is that so?"
Hordak says: "No, brother."
Hordak says: "I did it, all of it, for you."
Horde Prime says: "You have forgotten who you are."
Horde Prime says: "You truly think you are worthy to stand beside me, could be equal to me?"
Horde Prime says: "I made you in my image, but you have become an abomination."
Horde Prime says: "And so, you must be reborn."
Horde Prime says: "Take him to be reconditioned."
Horde Prime says: "But I have been rude."

Horde Prime says: "For order to thrive, this whole mess must be wiped away."
Horde Prime says: "Beginning with you."
Catra says: "I wouldn't do that if I were you."
Catra says: "You don't wanna destroy Etheria."
Catra says: "The whole planet is some kind of ancient superweapon."
Catra says: "A really, really big one."
Catra says: "Sparkle, here, is a part of it."
Catra says: "And if you wanna learn how to use it, you need me."
Horde Prime says: "A weapon?"
Horde Prime says: "That explains these readings."
Horde Prime says: "They are stronger than anything I've seen."
Horde Prime says: "Your Majesty, what an honor to host a guest of your stature."
Horde Prime says: "Trust that your planet will become the jewel of my empire, and it will allow me to bring peace and order to the farthest reaches of the universe."
