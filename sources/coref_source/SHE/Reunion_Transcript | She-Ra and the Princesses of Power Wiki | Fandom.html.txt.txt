Scene opens in Bright Moon.
Bow says: "Serenia, portal, Mara."
Bow says: "Maybe Mara's last name is Serenia, or the portal is a Serenia?"
Bow says: "I'm gonna be honest with you, future Bow, I'm getting nowhere."
Tracker pad beeps.
Bow says: "No."
Bow says: "Was that today?"
Bow says: "This can't be happening, not now."
Bow says: "No, no, no."
Glimmer teleports in.
Glimmer says: "Adora, get up."
Adora says: "What's going on?"
Adora says: "What is it?"
Glimmer says: "It's Bow."
Glimmer says: "He's in trouble."
Theme song plays.
Glimmer says: "Bows tracker pad and arrows are gone."
Glimmer says: "He must have left after he shot that note through my window."
Adora says: "The not that says, “I'm fine."
Adora says: "Don't follow me."
Adora says: "”?"
Glimmer says: "He's not fine."
Glimmer says: "We have to follow him."
Glimmer says: "If he was, he would've told us he was leaving."
Adora says: "Okay, okay, Glimmer, just clam down."
Adora says: "I agree, okay?"
Adora says: "So, where does Bow go when he's not at Bright Moon?"
Glimmer says: "Uh..."
Adora says: "Seriously?"
Adora says: "How long have you two been friends, again?"
Glimmer says: "Look, Bow really values his privacy."
Glimmer says: "He's never talked about his past or where he came from."
Glimmer says: "Never."
Glimmer says: "And you know how talkative and open Bow usually is."
Glimmer says: "Something's wrong."
Glimmer says: "What if he's in trouble?"
Adora says: "Bow definitely came this way, judging from the broken twigs, the sap and his incredibly distinct footprints."
Glimmer says: "There's no way Bow would ever leave his trick arrows behind."
Glimmer says: "I told you, he's in trouble."
Adora says: "What is that place?"
Glimmer teleports herself and Adora into the Library.
Glimmer says: "We have to find Bow, and get him out of this, uh..."
Glimmer says: "library?"
Adora says: "Have you ever heard of a library in the Whispering Woods?"
Door bangs open.
Adora and Glimmer gasp.
Bow enters room and sighs.
Glimmer says: "Bow, I'm so glad we found you."
Adora says: "or fight your kidnappers."
Adora says: "We're not exactly sure what we're – uh..."
Glimmer sees Bow's covered midriff says: "What have they done to you?"
Adora says: "We got your arrows."
Adora says: "Who are we fighting?"
Bow says: "No one."
Bow says: "You guys shouldn't be here."
Bow gasps.
Adora shouts.
George says: "Who's there?"
George says: "Who are these people?"
Bow says: "Play along."
Bow says: "This is Adora and Glimmer, my friends from the academy."
Bow says: "Adora, Glimmer, meet my dads."
George says: "Adora, Glimmer."
Lance says: "Oh, we're so happy to finally meet Bow's school friends."
Scene switches to the Fright Zone.
Catra says: "I need you to beef up security."
Catra says: "Bring all reports directly to me."
Catra says: "No one else."
Catra says: "I want patrols doubled."
Scorpia says: "Uh..."
Scorpia says: "You were saying?"
Catra says: "Yes, and report anything suspicious directly to me."
Lonnie says: "You mean like the fact that Shadow Weaver's cell is empty?"
Catra says: "I threw the prisoner into solitary last night."
Catra says: "Not that II need to explain myself to underlings."
Catra says: "You have your orders."
Catra says: "Next person who questions me gets to see Shadow Weaver's cell up close."
Catra says: "Move."
Rogelio grumbles.
Catra says: "I said, move!"
Lance says: "You want anything, you just tell me, and I'll get it."
Lance says: "You want snacks?"
Lance says: "I'll get you snacks."
George says: "Yes, so energetic."
George says: "Heh."
George says: "You girls must love attending the Academy of Historic Enterprises with Bow."
Glimmer says: "Uhh..."
Glimmer says: "Yes."
Glimmer says: "Absolutely."
Adora says: "Yup."
Adora says: "Wouldn't change a thing."
Lance says: "Oh, I bet you're here to see our collection of First Ones artifacts."
Lance says: "We got some new pottery shards."
Lance says: "I – Oh, what was I doing?"
George says: "Snacks."
Lance says: "Oh, yes, yes, yes."
Lance says: "Snacks."
George says: "The pottery is really something."
George says: "Bow's older brother sent it."
Glimmer spits out tea says: "Brother?"
Adora says: "Oh, bow has an older brother?"
Adora says: "How nice."
Lance says: "Youngest of 13, all historians just like us."
Lance says: "And just like Bow when he graduates and takes over the library."
Lance says: "Right Bow?"
George says: "Don't bother, Lance."
George says: "It looks like he's not very cha-tea today."
Lance groans.
Lance says: "A tour of the library."
Lance says: "Of course our Bow would find people who share his zest for history."
Lance says: "Just wait till we show you the oldest part of our collection."
Lance says: "A shard from an ancient, defunct runestone."
George says: "If it wasn't of historical value, that thing would be long gone."
George says: "No need to keep a reminder of the Princesses and their war here."
Glimmer says: "But..."
Glimmer says: "uh..."
Glimmer says: "But the Horde started the war."
Glimmer says: "The Princesses are fighting to save Etheria."
George says: "You're too young to remember the first failed Princess Alliance."
George says: "I'm not."
George says: "I enlisted, fought for what I thought was right."
Bow says: "Dad, can we not –?"
George says: "When I came home, there was nothing left of my village but ash."
George says: "I vowed then that my family would never get mixed up in fighting or the Princesses again."
Lance says: "Well, I know what will lighten the mood, baby pictures."
Lance says: "I've got some great ones from Bow's first bubble bath."
Bow says: "I'm gonna show Adora and Glimmer my room now!"
Adora says: "I wanna see the bubble baths."
Bow says: "Now!"
Glimmer says: "Bow, what is going on?"
Bow says: "My dad's don't know I'm a Rebellion fighter."
Bow says: "They think I'm at boarding school and I'm supposed to be on break right now."
Glimmer says: "So, this is why you never talked about your past?"
Glimmer says: "I thought it was because it was dark and painful for you, but your dads seem so nice and normal."
Bow says: "Look, I love my dads, okay?"
Bow says: "I never mentioned them, because they decided when I was a little kid that I was gonna be the one to stay home and take over the library when they retire."
Bow says: "But I wanted to travel, to fight."
Bow says: "So, I did the only thing I could."
Bow says: "I secretly taught myself archery, ran away, and pretended I was at a made-up boarding school."
Adora says: "That seems really elaborate, Bow."
Bow says: "You saw what they're like."
Bow says: "They don't listen to me."
Bow says: "They just assume they know what I want."
Bow says: "And if Lance knew I didn't want to be a historian..."
Bow says: "Worse, if George knew that I'm a Rebellion soldier fighting alongside Princesses, it'd kill them."
Glimmer says: "So, you're gonna lie to them forever?"
Bow says: "Not forever."
Bow says: "Just for the foreseeable future."
Bow says: "It's worked so far."
Bow says: "Please?"
Bow says: "For me?"
Bow says: "Besides, my dads have the biggest collection of First Ones artifacts and writings in Etheria."
Bow says: "This is the perfect place to look for answers about She-Ra, the Mara message, Serenia, everything."
Adora says: "Sure, why not?"
Adora says: "We can be scholars."
Adora says: "How hard can it be?"
Glimmer says: "This is gonna be a disaster."
Bow says: "Well, maybe with that attitude it will be."
Bow says: "By the way, I may have said in my letters that Glimmer is a physics major, Adora's an art major, nobody is a Princess or has magical powers, and we all met freshmen year."
Bow says: "Okay?"
Bow says: "Let's go."
Scene switches to the Fright Zone.
Catra groans.
Scorpia says: "Hey, Catra."
Scorpia says: "Listen, I've been looking for anything suspicious just like you said, but this is the Fright Zone, so, that's pretty much everything."
Scorpia says: "I was hoping you could tell me what I'm supposed to be looking for?"
Catra says: "If you spent more time following orders and less time questioning them, you wouldn't need me to."
Catra says: "Now get out."
Catra says: "Go."
Scorpia says: "Okay, wildcat."
Scorpia says: "I really didn't wanna have to do this, but you leave me no choice."
Catra says: "What are you doing?"
Scorpia says: "Just let all your cares go."
Scorpia says: "You're safe."
Scorpia says: "You're safe here."
Catra says: "Stop it."
Catra says: "Stop."
Scorpia says: "Shh shh."
Scorpia says: "You're safe here, okay?"
Catra says: "Let go of me."
Catra says: "Are you crazy?"
Scorpia says: "There's nothing we can't handle."
Catra says: "I lost Shadow Weaver."
Catra says: "How are we supposed to handle that?"
Scorpia says: "What?"
Catra says: "Sh-Shadow Weaver escaped."
Catra says: "I have to find her before Hordak learns the truth."
Scorpia says: "Well, you don't have to do this alone."
Scorpia says: "I'm here."
Scorpia says: "And I bet Entrapta can whip up some sort of locator."
Catra says: "No."
Catra says: "Entrapta spends all her time with Hordak and is bad with secrets."
Catra says: "The minute we tell Entrapta, she tells him, then it's all over for me."
Scorpia says: "Then we make sure that doesn't happen."
Scorpia says: "We'll find Shadow Weaver, the two of us, and not a word of it will leave this room."
Imp giggles.
Lance says: "This is the 1000-year-old Colonia pitcher."
Lance says: "And this tablet dates back over two millenia."
Lance says: "And this is where Bow played pretend as a little boy."
Glimmer says: "Let me guess, playing pirates?"
Lance says: "Oh, no."
Lance says: "Bow doesn't like pirates."
Lance says: "Playing historian, getting ready to take over the library even then."
Lance says: "Right, Bow?"
Bow says: "Right."
Adora says: "Mr."
Adora says: "Bow's dad, sir, as First Ones historians, do you know anything about the lore of She-Ra?"
Lance says: "Ah..."
Lance says: "Great question."
Lance says: "Accurate translations are hard to come buy, but we think the name was actually, Her-Ra."
Adora says: "Well, that's not right."
Bow says: "But you don't know that for sure, Adora."
Lance says: "She'd fight for the power of Geayskull."
Adora says: "It's “For the Honor of Grayskull."
Lance says: "And rode on a dragon."
Adora says: "Wait, she got a dragon?"
Bow laughs.
Lance says: "Anyway, uh, where was I?"
George says: "Princess nonsense."
Lance says: "The runestone shard."
Lance says: "It's the oldest First Ones object in our collection."
Lance says: "But enough about us."
Lance says: "Tell us about your studies, Adora and Glimmer."
Glimmer says: "Uh, you know, the physics are good."
Adora says: "The history is also good."
Lance says: "Uh..."
Lance says: "I thought you were and art major?"
Bow says: "Uh, she's a double major."
Adora says: "Uh, yes."
Adora says: "History, art, art history, that's three."
Adora says: "I'm a triple major."
Adora says: "And I also teach, unless that's not a thing students do."
Adora says: "Is it hot in here?"
Adora says: "I mean..."
George says: "It's really great to finally meet you, Glimmer."
George says: "Gotta be honest, we thought Bow was making you up."
Glimmer says: "Really?"
George says: "You know how Bow is, shy, quiet, not so many friends."
George says: "From his letters it sounds like you really brought him out of his shell."
Glimmer says: "Uh, yeah."
Glimmer says: "I guess I did."
Bow says: "So, for school, heh, we got this First Ones puzzle to solve."
Bow says: "But the last word is giving us trouble."
Bow says: "Have you ever heard of Serenia?"
Lance says: "Ooh!"
Lance says: "Serenia was the name of a mythical First Ones hero."
George says: "Although some of us think she was a real person."
Lance says: "Umm-hmm."
Lance says: "Some of us also think the Elberon vase dates back only one millennia."
Bow says: "Is theis everything you have on Serenia?"
Lance says: "Oh, no."
Lance says: "I'm so sorry."
Lance says: "Ha, ha."
Lance says: "Everything from the first floor."
Lance says: "There's lots more on the second."
Glimmer says: "Uhh, this is gonna take hours."
Lance says: "Hours, days, maybe weeks."
Lance says: "And if you're really lucky, it might take you a whole lifetime."
George says: "Uh."
George says: "You're so corny."
Adora says: "Well, this one's just about aqueducts, so, it's mislabeled."
Lance says: "Wait, you can read First Ones writing?"
Adora says: "Uh, I also study linguistics."
Adora says: "It's a fifth major or fourth major."
Adora says: "I'm losing count."
George says: "What does this say?"
Adora says: "Uh, it says, “lunch”."
George says: "Oh, no."
George says: "I thought it said love."
Lance says: "You thought it said..."
Lance says: "?"
Lance says: "Actually, there's one more debate you can settle for us, Adora."
Adora says: "I dunno."
Adora says: "Maybe I should help with the, uh, school project."
Adora says: "But I guess it couldn't hurt."
Lance says: "Great."
Lance says: "Onward, best research squad."
Time passes.
Bow says: "We're still getting nowhere."
Bow says: "What does a mythological First Ones hero have to do with Mara?"
Bow says: "Hey, Glimmer, what's up?"
Glimmer says: "What's up with you?"
Glimmer says: "You have a secret family, and you're supposed to be a historian, and you apparently hate pirates, and you never told me about any of this."
Glimmer says: "I feel like I don't know you at all."
Bow says: "Glimmer, you know everything about me, the real me."
Bow says: "I act lie someone I'm not with my family because the truth would hurt them."
Glimmer says: "And it's making you miserable."
Glimmer says: "Bow, your dads love you."
Glimmer says: "I'm sure they'll love the real you, too."
Bow says: "You don't know that."
Bow says: "They've had a plan for me since I was a baby."
Bow says: "But the truth is, I'm nothing like the rest of my family."
Bow says: "I've tried to tell them, but they don't want to hear it."
Bow says: "So, I pretend."
Scene switches to a different part of the Library.
Lance says: "This was found in the same dig site as the runestone shard."
Lance says: "Thing is, we can't agree on what it is."
Lance says: "So, what's it say?"
Adora says: "Oh, this one's easy."
Adora says: "This is a password to open it."
Adora says: "It's says, “Eternia”."
Elemental powers up.
Lance says: "Ooh, ooh."
Lance says: "It's working!"
Lance says: "It's – it's..."
George says: "A monster."
Elemental roars.
Bow and Glimmer gasp elemental crashes.
Adora says: "It's an elemental."
Adora says: "This'll be a piece of cake."
Bow says: "Adora, wait!"
Adora says: "For the honor of Grayskull!"
Adora transforms into She-Ra.
George and Lance gasp, shout.
Bow says: "Adora is a sixth major in She-Ra?"
Elemental crashes.
She-Ra says: "Don't worry, I got this."
She-Ra says: "Ha, ha."
Glimmer says: "Hey, leave her alone."
She-Ra says: "Hold on, Glimmer."
She-Ra says: "I'm coming."
Bow says: "They really get into their studies."
Lance says: "Bow, are your friends Princesses?"
Bow says: "Now we have to act before the Elemental turns on us."
Lance says: "You know what that is?"
Bow says: "We've run into them before."
Bow says: "They only attack when they're trying to protect something."
Bow says: "So, what is it trying to protect?"
George says: "You've run into them before?"
George says: "Who are you?"
Elemental roars, crashes.
Glimmer and She-Ra shout.
Lance says: "It was found alongside the runestone shard."
Lance says: "Could it be that?"
Bow says: "Dad, you're a genius."
Bow says: "I promise I'll explain everything, but right now you have to trust me."
George says: "Bow?"
George says: "Bow!"
George says: "Bow, you get back here."
Lance says: "Never mind."
Lance says: "Stay away!"
Lance says: "Stay away!"
Bow says: "Glimmer."
Glimmer says: "Got it."
Lance screams George shouts Glimmer teleports George and Lance.
Glimmer says: "It's been really nice meeting you."
Bow says: "Can't reach."
George says: "Bow!"
Bow says: "Got it."
Arrow strikes the Elemental.
George says: "Huh?"
Lance says: "Huh?"
Bow says: "Whoa!"
Lance says: "Bow!"
Elemental roars.
Bow says: "Huh?"
Elemental takes runestone shard, powers down to safe-mode.
Glimmer says: "That's my Bow."
George says: "What is going on?"
She-Ra transforms into Adora.
Bow says: "I..."
Bow says: "I lied to you."
Bow says: "There is not Academy of Historic Enterprises."
Bow says: "I've been living at Bright Moon, fighting in the Rebellion alongside Adora and Princess Glimmer."
Lance says: "But..."
Lance says: "why?"
Bow says: "I don't wanna be a historian."
Bow says: "I've never wanted to be a historian."
Bow says: "I'm not a shy bookworm."
Bow says: "I'm not a genius like you two."
Bow says: "I make things."
Bow says: "I'm a soldier."
Bow says: "This is who I am."
Bow says: "And I can't lie about it anymore, even though I know I'm breaking your hearts."
George says: "What's breaking our hearts is the fact that you thought you had to lie about who you are."
Bow says: "You're not mad?"
Bow says: "But I'm a fighter, and you hate fighters."
George says: "I could never hate you."
George says: "Never."
George says: "If you feel like you belong in the Rebellion, that's where you belong."
Lance says: "Oh, Bow, why didn't you just tell us?"
Bow says: "I tried, but you didn't listen."
Bow says: "You only listened to me if I said what you wanted to hear."
Lance says: "We had no idea you felt that way."
Lance says: "We, we were just trying to encourage you to pursue your dreams."
Lance says: "We thought we were being supportive when we really were being terrible."
George says: "We love you the way you are, Bow."
George says: "And, we're proud of you, no matter what path you take in life."
Glimmer sobs.
George says: "This is a family hug, Princesses."
George says: "You're Bow's family, too."
Time passes.
Bow says: "On one of our missions, we received a message from an unknown source."
Bow says: "If we knew what Serenia meant, I think we could figure out the rest."
Lance says: "“Serenia, portal, Mara” Okay."
Lance says: "But what are these other words?"
Adora says: "I don't know."
Adora says: "It's too degraded to read."
George says: "Wait a second."
George says: "Lance, what does this pattern look like?"
Lance says: "Oh, I think you're right."
Bow says: "What is it?"
George says: "Look at it, Bow."
George says: "Really look at it."
George says: "What do you see?"
Bow says: "These aren't words at all, are they?"
Lance says: "Oh, now you've got it."
Lance says: "George, get the projector."
George says: "The world of the First Ones was different from ours."
George says: "Climate, language, even the sky was different, filled with cosmic formations they called..."
Adora says: "Stars!"
Lance says: "The First Ones used them to navigate and named constellations after mythical heroes, including Serenia."
George says: "The constellation Serenia would only appear in summer and only over one place."
Glimmer says: "The Crimson Waste."
Adora says: "Then that's were we have to go."
Lance says: "What?"
Lance says: "You can't go just into the Crimson Waste."
Lance says: "It's a no-man's-land, a giant lifeless desert."
Lance says: "On one's ever made it that far and come back alive."
George says: "Promise me you kids will stay away."
Scene switches to Hordak's sanctum.
Catra says: "You wanted to speak with me, Lord Hordak?"
Hordak says: "Yes, Force Captain."
Hordak says: "I wish to touch base, as you put it."
Hordak says: "See hoe my orders are being carried out."
Catra says: "Everything is running smoothly."
Hordak says: "Does this mean Shadow Weaver has been transferred to Beast Island per my orders?"
Catra says: "Yes."
Catra says: "I sent her yesterday, just like you ordered."
Catra says: "Believe me, we're never going to see her again."
Recording of Catra says: "I lost Shadow Weaver!"
Recording of Catra says: "Shadow Weaver escaped."
Recording of Catra says: "I have to find her before Hordak learns the truth."
Imp giggles.
Hordak says: "You lied to me."
Catra says: "Wait."
Machine powers up.
Catra gasps.
Hordak says: "I know your lax security allowed Shadow Weaver to escape."
Hordak says: "I know you've been covering it up, lying about her whereabouts."
Hordak says: "But worst of all, I gave you the chance to come clean, to prove your worth to me, to the Horde."
Hordak says: "This was a test."
Hordak says: "And you failed."
Catra chokes.
Shadow Weaver appears.
