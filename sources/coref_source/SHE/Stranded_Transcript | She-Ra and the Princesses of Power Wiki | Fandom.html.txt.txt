Mara's ship cuts through space. Bow stands and removes his space helmet, then consults his tracker pad.
Glimmer's arm trembles.
Adora says: "So, let me make sure I get this right."
Adora says: "Catra saved you from Horde Prime."
Adora says: "Like "Catra" Catra?"
Adora says: "Why would she do that?"
Adora says: "It doesn't make any sense."
Glimmer says: "She said she wanted to do one good thing in her life."
Glimmer says: "She said she was doing it for you."
Adora looks down. She sinks to the floor.
Glimmer says: "There's so much I want to say, to both of you, about what happened on Etheria."
Glimmer says: "About what I said."
Glimmer says: "What I did."
Glimmer says: "What I mean is I'm really, really..."
Bow says: "Aah!"
Their ship lurches.
Adora says: "What was that?"
Bow says: "I'll check on Entrapta."
Bow walks out of the room.
Tears stream down Glimmer's cheeks.
Glimmer says: "{sniffling} {sobbing} Adora, I'm so sorry for everything I said."
Glimmer says: "You were right about everything."
Glimmer says: "I should have just listened to you."
Adora says: "Hey, hey, it's okay."
Adora says: "We're here now."
Adora says: "And nothing is going to pull us apart again."
Adora says: "I really missed you, too."
Adora says: "Aah!"
Entrapta says: "Hi."
Entrapta says: "So, slight problem."
Adora says: "What's going on?"
Adora says: "Is it Horde Prime?"
Entrapta says: "No."
Entrapta says: "Darla and I managed to avoid his ships."
Entrapta says: "Darla says hi, by the way."
Entrapta says: "Darla, say hi."
Darla says: "Hello."
Entrapta says: "Oh, right."
Entrapta says: "Glimmer, Darla is the ship."
Adora says: "I mean, why are we lurching?"
Bow says: "Because our fuel crystals are almost burned out."
Bow says: "We're running on empty."
Entrapta says: "But not to worry."
Entrapta says: "Darla's sensors have picked up a nearby planet that has a natural supply of the exact fuel crystals we need, and I've set a course."
Entrapta says: "So, all we have to do is gently glide through a rocky debris field, the planet's incredibly dense atmosphere, and gingerly land on a solid crystalline surface."
Entrapta says: "Hang on!"
All says: "Ahh!"
Theme Song.
Scorpia says: "Good night, everyone."
Scorpia says: "Gotta get that beauty sleep for defeating Horde Prime."
Scorpia says: "There's nothing we can't do after a good night's rest."
Scorpia spots Swift Wind looking at the sky.
Swift Wind says: "Come on."
Swift Wind says: "Pick up, pick up."
Scorpia says: "Hey, buddy."
Scorpia says: "Oh, sorry!"
Scorpia says: "Uh, whatcha doing?"
Swift Wind says: "I'm, uh, on watch patrol tonight."
Swift Wind says: "You know, so just, uh, protecting us from any bots Horde Prime might send."
Scorpia says: "Uh-huh."
Scorpia says: "Like you were the night before, and the night before that, and basically every night since Adora left?"
He gazes up at the sky.
Scorpia says: "I can take over if you want?"
Scorpia says: "It's getting pretty late."
Swift Wind says: "No."
Swift Wind says: "That's okay."
Swift Wind says: "Uh..."
Swift Wind says: "I was kind of in the middle of something."
Scorpia says: "Ooh, what is it?"
Swift Wind says: "It's nothing."
Swift Wind says: "You'd laugh at me."
Scorpia says: "I would never."
Scorpia says: "You can tell me."
Scorpia says: "I'm great with secrets."
Scorpia says: "Like, one time, Kyle told me he had a crush on Rogel..."
Scorpia says: "Yeah, uh..."
Scorpia says: "Never mind."
Scorpia says: "I didn't say anything."
Scorpia says: "What?"
Scorpia says: "Anyway, I'm a vault for secrets."
Swift Wind says: "I've had this connection to She-Ra."
Swift Wind says: "Our sacred bond."
Swift Wind says: "And, yeah, I know She-Ra's gone, but I thought maybe I could still connect to Adora."
Swift Wind says: "Talk to her, fill her in on what's been going on."
Scorpia says: "Oh!"
Scorpia says: "Tell her I say hi."
Swift Wind says: "That's the problem."
Swift Wind says: "I haven't been able to feel her."
Swift Wind says: "I've been picking a bright spot in the sky every night, hoping it might be Mara's ship, and sending a daily report, but..."
Scorpia says: "I bet you just haven't picked the right one."
Scorpia says: "Do you think that's them?"
Scorpia says: "Or wait."
Scorpia says: "What about that one?"
Scorpia says: "No, never mind, that's a moon."
Scorpia says: "How about that one?"
Scorpia says: "No."
Scorpia says: "Also a moon."
Scorpia says: "Gosh, have you ever noticed how many moons we have here?"
Scorpia says: "It's weird."
Scorpia put her arm around the horse.
Meanwhile.
Adora says: "This is the Crystal Planet?"
Adora says: "With all the crystals?"
Entrapta says: "Correct."
Bow says: "So, then where are the crystals?"
A barren landscape.
Entrapta says: "Well, Darla's sensors say the crystals are on this planet, and Darla would never lie to me."
Entrapta says: "So they've gotta be here somewhere."
Glimmer says: "What is that?"
Bow says: "It's a Spire."
Bow says: "They're the first wave of Horde Prime's invasion."
Bow says: "It's what he's doing to Etheria right now."
Glimmer says: "This planet, he destroyed it."
Glimmer says: "That's what he's doing to Etheria?"
Glimmer says: "This is all my fault."
Bow says: "Because you activated the Heart of Etheria."
Bow says: "My tracker pad is picking up an energy signal."
Bow says: "Entrapta's right, those crystals must be here somewhere."
Bow says: "We'll have to find them on foot I guess."
Entrapta says: "I'll get to work prepping Darla for the new crystals, removing the old ones."
Entrapta says: "They're ancient."
Entrapta says: "It's a miracle they lasted this long."
Entrapta says: "They must've fused with her engines by now."
Entrapta says: "Oh, it must be so painful for her."
Darla says: "I do not feel pain."
Entrapta says: "Okay, good luck finding the crystals."
Entrapta says: "Darla and I are going to spend some quality time together."
Entrapta readies tools and hurries off.
Adora says: "Uh..."
Adora says: "Uh-hm..."
The others set off across the planet.
Bow says: "We're looking for these pink crystals."
Bow says: "Thulite."
Adora says: "Not a lot of pink here."
Adora says: "Or any colors."
Glimmer says: "That's okay."
Glimmer says: "We'll find them."
Glimmer says: "We're the Best Friend Squad, and we're great at quests."
Glimmer says: "Right, Bow?"
Bow says: "Yeah."
Bow says: "Sure."
Bow says: "Come on."
Glimmer says: "{sighs} He's still mad at me, isn't he?"
Adora says: "Well, Bow missed you so much."
Adora says: "But he was really hurt by everything you--By everything that happened."
Adora says: "I think he was so focused on finding you, he never actually worked through all his stuff."
Glimmer says: "Well, what do I do?"
Glimmer says: "There has to be a way to fix it."
Adora says: "You're asking me?"
Adora says: "{laughs} Wow!"
Adora says: "Bow's usually the friendship stuff guy and I'm usually the "punch your feelings out" guy."
Adora says: "But okay, um..."
Adora says: "Uh..."
Adora says: "Maybe if you try-- Oh!"
Glimmer says: "Bow!"
A hole opens and Glimmer shoves him, Adora falls through.
Glimmer says: "Adora!"
Bow says: "Adora!"
She drops through a crack in the earth and skids into a rocky cave.
Glimmer says: "Are you okay?!"
Glimmer says: "!"
Adora says: "I'm okay!"
Adora says: "And I found the crystals!"
Adora says: "Not the pink ones, though."
Glimmer says: "Just stay put, we're coming."
Glimmer says: "We'll have to find another way down."
Adora says: "I think I see a light."
Adora says: "I'm gonna go towards it."
Bow says: "Don't go towards the light!"
Adora says: "It's not that kind of light!"
Adora grips her staff and strives forward. On Etheria, Spinnerella sets down a bowl of food and Netossa covers Swift Wind with a blanket. They head to a tent and the horse gazes upwards.
Swift Wind says: "Adora."
Swift Wind says: "Hello from Etheria."
Swift Wind says: "It's me, Swift Wind."
Swift Wind says: "Oh, man, have I got a lot to catch you up on."
Swift Wind says: "So, a lot of people have been looking for you because of the bounty Horde Prime put out, but don't worry, Perfuma and Scorpia took care of them."
Swift Wind says: "Kapow!"
Swift Wind says: "Bam!"
Swift Wind says: "{chuckles} I don't know, plant noises!"
Swift Wind says: "Then some drones tried to attack the mountain colonies, but Mermista and Frosta totally handled it."
Swift Wind says: "Dag-dag-dag-dag-dag!"
Swift Wind says: "{laughs} That's ice."
Swift Wind says: "That's be being the sound of ice."
Swift Wind says: "So, then back at camp, Shadow Weaver was all like, "Perhaps we should use magic to discover Horde Prime's true motivaitons."
Swift Wind says: "" "Oh, not this again!"
Swift Wind says: "" "No."
Swift Wind says: "Bad Shadow Weaver."
Swift Wind says: "Bad."
Swift Wind says: "" "But magic, magic, magic, power, power, power, blah, blah, blah."
Swift Wind says: "" {groaning} "Why are you still here?"
Swift Wind says: "" Everyone was pretty on edge."
Swift Wind says: "That's when Sea Hawk got an idea."
Swift Wind says: ""Morale-boosting adventure!"
Swift Wind says: "" It didn't go well."
Swift Wind says: ""Ugh make it stop."
Swift Wind says: "" At all."
Swift Wind says: "It was terrible."
Swift Wind says: "It's one of the worst things I've ever seen."
Swift Wind says: "{laughs} {sighs} Anyway, hope space is fun."
Swift Wind says: "And that you're getting these."
Swift Wind says: "It's just, uh..."
Swift Wind says: "{chuckes} I know the others think this is useless."
Swift Wind says: "I know."
Swift Wind says: "They try to be supportive, but I see it."
Swift Wind says: "So, if you could just give me a sign you're hearing this..."
Swift Wind says: "{sighs} Come home soon, Adora."
Swift Wind says: "We need you."
On the Crystal Planet, Adora spots footprints on the ground. The lights go out.
Adora says: "Hello?"
A dagger flies past her in a bird swoop.
Starla says: "{grunts} Haa!"
Adora says: "Wait!"
Tallstar says: "Intruder!"
Jewelstar says: "Who are you?"
Jewelstar says: "Why are you following us?"
Adora says: "Why are you hitting me?"
Jewelstar says: "Answer the questions!"
Adora says: "You first!"
Adora says: "Are you with the Horde?"
Jewelstar says: "No way!"
Adora says: "Whoa!"
Starla says: "We're only here for the fuel."
Starla says: "After that, we're getting as far away from Horde Prime as possible."
Jewelstar says: "Are you with the Horde?"
Adora says: "No."
Adora says: "I mean--{grunts} I was, but I'm not anymore."
Adora says: "It's complicated, okay?"
Tallstar says: "What's complicated?"
Jewelstar says: "Do you serve Horde Prime or not?"
Adora says: "No!"
Adora says: "Do you?"
Jewelstar says: "No!"
Tallstar says: "No!"
 says: "No!"
Starla says: "No!"
Adora says: "{grunts} Then we're all on the same side."
Adora says: "Can we please stop hitting each other now?"
Bow and Glimmer start down and Glimmer slips.
Bow says: "Glimmer!"
Bow grabs her.
Glimmer says: "Sorry."
Bow says: "You should be more careful now that you can't teleport."
Glimmer says: "I really miss teleporting."
Glimmer says: "Remember when I finally learned how to use my powers?"
Glimmer says: "We teleported everywhere."
Glimmer says: "Bright Moon, Mystacor..."
Bow says: "Castaspella hated it."
Glimmer says: "But we'd always teleport away just when she was about to catch us."
Bow smiles, then frowns.
Bow says: "That was forever ago."
Bow says: "A lot's changed since then."
Glimmer says: "Uh..."
Glimmer says: "um..."
Glimmer says: "Yeah."
Glimmer says: "I guess it has."
Bow starts off and she follows.
Meanwhile, Adora sits in a circle with the three warriors. Starla feeds the bird and the creature glows. Adora looks around at crystals on the walls. Starla offers a bowl of food.
Starla says: "Do you want any?"
Starla says: "I'm Starla, by the way."
Tallstar says: "Starla, you can't just offer every stranger that shows up our food."
Starla says: "It's one person."
Starla says: "Besides, we have plenty to share."
Adora gobbles the food.
Adora says: "{clears throat} Sorry."
Adora says: "And thanks."
Adora says: "I'm Adora."
Jewelstar says: "Jewelstar."
Jewelstar says: "And it doesn't matter."
Tallstar says: "Once we get the thulite crystals, we're blasting off, and rations won't be a problem."
Adora says: "The pink crystals?"
Adora says: "That's my my friends and I are here."
Jewelstar says: "Yeah, but they're pretty much impossible to get to."
Adora says: "Earthquakes?"
Jewelstar says: "We're stranded until we can get them."
Adora says: "We can't be stuck here."
Adora says: "There's no time."
Adora says: "Horde Prime invaded Etheria."
Adora says: "I have to stop him before he takes it."
Tallstar says: "If he's on your planet, it's already over."
Tallstar says: "This place used to be a safe harbor for travelers across the galaxy."
Tallstar says: "Then Horde Prime arrived."
Tallstar says: "Now we're just scavenging the remains."
Tallstar says: "Same as he did to our home world."
Starla weeps.
Tallstar says: "If you're smart, you'll run away."
Tallstar says: "Far, far away."
Tallstar says: "Like we're trying to do."
Adora says: "Well, I'm not."
Adora says: "Running away, that is."
Adora says: "I am smart."
Adora says: "Never mind."
Adora says: "Look, I'm a part of a rebellion, fighting the Horde."
Adora says: "Once my friends find me and we get fuel, I'm going to face Prime, and I'm gonna stop him."
Starla says: "Wow!"
Starla says: "Really?"
Adora says: "Really."
Adora says: "Why don't you help us fight back?"
Adora says: "You've got the tech and the weapons, wh--You could do so much more than just scavenge."
Tallstar says: "Get killed?"
Tallstar says: "Prime has already taken our home."
Tallstar says: "Do you think we'd be on this wreck of a planet if we had a choice?"
Tallstar says: "Horde Prime always wins."
Tallstar says: "He's unstoppable."
Jewelstar says: "And you're just one girl with a stick."
Jewelstar says: "What could you possibly do?"
Adora says: "Well, I used to be stronger."
Adora says: "But that doesn't matter."
Adora says: "If everyone works together, I know we can take him down."
Adora says: "He has to pay for what he did, and he--He has someone on his ship."
Adora says: "Someone I--We're stopping him."
Adora says: "Period."
Jewelstar says: "If your friend is with Prime, it's already too late."
Adora says: "Oh, no."
Adora says: "Catra is not my friend."
Adora says: "I mean, she's--she used to be, but that was a long time ago, and she's tried to kill me a bunch of times since then, but then she saved Glimmer."
Adora says: "And maybe that means there's still good in her, and now I don't know."
Adora says: "It's..."
Adora says: "{sighs} It's complicated."
Tallstar says: "Everything seems really complicated with you."
Jewelstar says: "Whatever she is, friend or not, she's gone."
Jewelstar says: "There's no point in going back for her."
Jewelstar says: "No one stands up to Prime and survives."
Jewelstar says: "I'm sorry."
Glimmer says: "Bow, wait up!"
Glimmer says: "Bow!"
Glimmer says: "Would you please slow down?"
Bow says: "I just wanna get back to the ship."
Adora says: "It's all right."
Adora says: "They're my friends."
Tallstar says: "They don't sound like friends."
Adora says: "Are you guys--?"
Bow says: "We're fine."
Bow says: "Who are the space pirates?"
The cave quakes and crystals drop from the ceiling.
Adora says: "These are the Star Siblings."
Adora says: "They're after the same thing we are, and we should all be working together."
Adora says: "You know where the fuel crystals are, and we can help."
Adora says: "What do you say?"
Entrapta says: "Hello!"
Tallstar says: "Okay."
Tallstar says: "How many of you are there?"
Entrapta says: "Several."
Entrapta says: "Adora, I came as fast as I could to warn you."
Entrapta says: "Darla's sensors indicate that this planet is a apparently a hotbed of seismic activity."
Adora says: "Yeah, uh, we kind of learned that the hard way."
Entrapta says: "Well, Darla and I figured out an algorithm to predict the tremors and we're sort of running out of time before the really big one hits."
Entrapta says: "So, are we getting the thulite now or..."
Jewelstar says: "Fine."
Jewelstar says: "We need to hurry."
Jewelstar says: "Let's go."
They set off together.
Starla says: "Then Jewel will cover Glory and me while we wing fling."
Jewelstar says: "Just absolutely not."
Starla says: "You're saying you won't cover me?"
Starla says: "You kind of have to."
Starla says: "You're my big brother."
Tallstar says: "Yeah, ouch, Jewel."
Tallstar says: "Cold."
Jewelstar says: "No, just--of course I'll--just don't do anything fancy."
Jewelstar says: "Get the crystals and get out."
Tallstar says: "Eridani."
Starla says: "Or Aquarii."
Starla says: "We should not have gotten fancy there."
Tallstar says: "Uh!"
Tallstar says: "Think fast."
Glimmer says: "You guys are pretty close, huh?"
Tallstar says: "Yeah."
Tallstar says: "Growing up under the threat of Horde Prime does that to you."
Tallstar says: "We've lost a lot, but we still have each other."
Glimmer glances back at Bow and he walks past her.
Glimmer says: "Uh..."
They follow the Star Siblings, then stop.
Jewelstar says: "There it is."
Jewelstar says: "That's the thulite."
Bow says: "We have to get over that?"
Starla says: "The chasm is wider than last time we tried."
Starla says: "It's getting worse."
Starla says: "This whole planet is falling apart."
Entrapta says: "Uh-uh..."
Entrapta says: "according to these readings, there's gonna be another quake soon."
Adora says: "A bridge!"
Adora says: "If we knock this column over during the next quake, we could bridge the gap and get across."
Tallstar says: "It's risky, but it might work."
Tallstar says: "Everyone, get ready."
Entrapta says: "Three, two, one!"
They shove the column and it falls across the chasm.
Starla says: "Let's do this."
They hurry across.
Tallstar says: "No!"
Tallstar says: "That's our only way out."
Adora says: "No."
Adora and Tallstar raise the column.
The ground cracks beneath Glimmer's feet.
Glimmer says: "{gasps} What's happening?"
Bow says: "Glimmer!"
Glimmer says: "{screams} Bow!"
Jewelstar says: "It won't hold!"
Jewelstar says: "We need to turn back!"
Glimmer clings to a rock face.
Bow says: "Jump!"
Bow says: "I'll catch you!"
Glimmer looks up at the pink crystals.
Glimmer says: "We can't!"
Glimmer says: "This is our one shot."
Bow says: "It's too dangerous!"
Glimmer says: "Please, Bow."
Glimmer says: "Just trust me, okay?"
He nods and she climbs up.
Jewelstar says: "Ahh..."
Jewelstar says: "!"
Jewel pierces with his sword and a chunk of rock cracks off the ceiling and plummets towards him. Starla and Glory blast it away.
Bow assists with the column.
Jewelstar says: "Your friend better hurry."
Entrapta says: "Uh-oh!"
Adora says: "Uh-oh."
Adora says: "What do you mean "uh-oh?"
Entrapta says: "Slight hiccup in my calculations."
Entrapta says: "The seismic activity is increasing faster than anticipated."
Tallstar says: "What does that mean?"
Entrapta says: "We're out of time."
Entrapta says: "They need to come back now before this whole place breaks apart!"
Glimmer says: "You can do this."
Glimmer reaches the top.
The grounds crumbles.
Jewelstar says: "We need to get out of here, now!"
Bow fastens a rope around the the sword and uses his arrow to brace it. Jewel and Starla race across.
Bow says: "Go!"
Bow says: "We're right behind you!"
They nod and run off.
Bow says: "Glimmer."
Entrapta checks her computer.
Entrapta says: "There's no time!"
Tallstar says: "{groans} I can't hold it anymore."
Adora says: "No!"
Adora says: "Hang on!"
Tallstar's arms fall apart and she collapses.
Adora says: "My friends are on the other side."
Adora says: "I am not going anywhere."
Adora says: "I'm not leaving anyone behind."
She glows and and raises the boulder.
The chamber fills with golden light; Adora drops to her knees.
Tallstar says: "Was that magic?"
Adora blinks.
Entrapta says: "She-Ra."
Entrapta says: "I think that was She-Ra."
Glimmer falls with an arm full of crystals and Bow catches her.
The rope snaps.
Glimmer says: "No!"
The column falls.
Bow says: "Ready to do something that probably won't work?"
Glimmer says: "Always."
Bow fires an arrow with a rope and they swing across the chasm. Bow grips the ledge on the other side and Glimmer falls. He grabs her hand.
Glimmer says: "Bow."
They others haul them up.
Bow says: "Glimmer, are you okay?"
Glimmer says: "Yeah."
Glimmer says: "I'm okay."
Bow smiles.
Adora says: "Come on."
Rocks and crystals crash around them and they run out of the cave as the opening is blocked with a pile of boulders.
Starla says: "Wow!"
Starla says: "Oh!"
Starla says: "We did it."
Starla says: "We actually did it."
Bow turns and walks away. Later, the Star Siblings whisper.
Starla says: "Did you see what she did?"
Adora approaches.
Jewelstar says: "Thank you for helping us get the fuel."
Jewelstar says: "You Etherians are so reckless."
Starla says: "Stubborn."
Tallstar says: "And brave."
Tallstar says: "Magic hasn't been seen in the universe in centuries."
Tallstar says: "But what I saw you do, you might actually be able to take on Prime."
Tallstar says: "And we want in."
Jewelstar says: "We've spent our whole lives running away."
Jewelstar says: "But not anymore."
Starla says: "We're going to fight Prime and take back our home."
Adora says: "Then welcome to the Rebellion."
They shake hands.
Darla says: "Two light stores replenished."
Darla says: "Ship refueled."
Glimmer finds Bow on Mara's ship.
Glimmer says: "Look, I know you're still mad at me."
Glimmer says: "Maybe you'll be mad at me for a really long time."
Glimmer says: "I deserve it."
Glimmer says: "And maybe--maybe we'll--maybe we'll never be friends like we used to be."
Glimmer says: "But I'm not going to stop trying to make it better."
Glimmer says: "I made a mistake with the Heart of Etheria."
Glimmer says: "I should have listened to you, and I'm sorry."
Glimmer says: "You get to be mad, for as long as you need to be."
Glimmer says: "But I'm not going anywhere."
Glimmer says: "And when you're ready, I'll be here."
Bow shuts the computer and glances back, then takes her hands.
Bow says: "Okay."
Adora smiles, then turns to look at the sky.
Glimmer says: "Adora?"
Glimmer says: "Are you okay?"
Adora says: "Yeah."
Glimmer says: "You wanna go back for her."
Adora says: "Mm-hm."
Adora nods.
Adora says: "I can't just leave her there."
Adora says: "I have to try."
Glimmer says: "Catra sacrificed herself to save me."
Glimmer says: "Whatever you need to do, I'm with you."
Bow says: "Then let's do this."
Bow says: "Best Friend Squad style."
They embrace. On Etheria, Swift Wind's horn glows.
Scorpia says: "Oh!"
Scorpia says: "Oh!"
Scorpia says: "What is it?"
Scorpia says: "What's going on?"
Swift Wind says: "I felt her."
Swift Wind says: "She-Ra is back."
Credits Roll.
