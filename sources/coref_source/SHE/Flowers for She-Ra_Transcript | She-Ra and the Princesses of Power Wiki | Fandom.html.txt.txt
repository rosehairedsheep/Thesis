Glimmer says: "Okay."
Glimmer says: "You've seen the dining hall, the throne room, the portrait hall."
Glimmer says: "So, the last stop on our grand tour is..."
Glimmer says: "your new room!"
Glimmer says: "Ta-da!"
Glimmer says: "It's pretty standard."
Glimmer says: "You've got your vanity, the bathroom, crystals, bell pull, tea nook, more crystals, bed, desk, and of course, the waterfall."
Adora says: "Is the waterfall for showering?"
Glimmer says: "Ha!"
Glimmer says: "Good one, Adora."
Glimmer says: ""Waterfall for showering."
Glimmer says: ""  I'm right down the hall if you need anything."
Glimmer says: "Night."
Door closes.
Adora says: "Okay."
Adora says: "This is different than the Fright Zone, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of this in no time."
Adora says: "Help."
Theme plays.
Adora says: "Come on, get flatter!"
Adora says: "No!"

Adora says: "Who is that?"
Angella says: "King Micah."
Angella says: "My husband."
Angella says: "He built the Rebellion with me."
Angella says: "And he was one of the first casualties of The Horde."
Adora says: "Sorry."
Adora says: "I didn't know."
Angella says: "Adora."
Angella says: "My daughter believes you can help us."
Angella says: "Glimmer has vouched for you despite your background."

Adora says: "I couldn't sleep in my room."
Adora says: "I've never slept without any other people around before."
Adora says: "And then I ran into your mom, I think she doesn't like me."
Glimmer says: "What?"
Glimmer says: "My mom loves you."
Adora says: "Yeah, sure."
Adora says: "She loves She-Ra."
Glimmer says: "Mom can be..."

Adora says: "Uh, the chairs are still empty."
Glimmer says: "Those are for the other Etherian Princesses, but..."
Glimmer says: "none of them have been active members since I was a kid."
Glimmer says: "The Rebellion had a big defeat years ago, and most of the old Princesses gave up."
Glimmer says: "Now all the kingdoms keep to themselves, and the new Princesses do the same."
Bow says: "Other than Spinnerella and Netossa."
Bow says: "Hey, guys!"
Bow says: "We're not really sure what they do."
Adora says: "Ah."
Gasping.
Adora says: "What?"

Glimmer says: "Sorry!"
Glimmer says: "First day."
Glimmer says: "Won't happen again!"
Adora says: "What did I do?"
Glimmer says: "You sat in my dad's chair."
Adora says: "Oh..."
Adora says: "Oh."
Adora says: "I'm sorry."
Angella says: "I've asked you here because I've received a distress call from Princess Perfuma."
Angella says: "The Horde is laying siege to her kingdom."
Angella says: "She's asking Bright Moon for assistance."
Angella says: "General?"
Bright Moon General says: "Perfuma's kingdom, Plumeria, is located near the front lines."
Angella says: "Bright Moon will provide food and humanitarian aid."
Glimmer says: "Ooh!"
Glimmer says: "I have a better idea."
Angella says: "Fight the Horde?"
Angella says: "Glimmer, you propose this idea every meeting."
Glimmer says: "No!"
Glimmer says: "I was going to say, let's use aggressive fist-to-face sparkles."
Angella says: "I said, no, Glimmer."
Angella says: "Now sit down!"
Glimmer huffs.
Adora says: "You should send me, Glimmer, and Bow to lead the relief mission."
Adora says: "You can send me as She-Ra."
Adora says: "I'll make sure everyone gets there safely and protect Bow and Glimmer if the Horde attacks."
Adora says: "I promise, I won't disappoint you."
Angella says: "Very well."
Angella says: "You will deliver food and supplies to Plumeria, and under no circumstances will you engage the Horde."
Angella says: "You leave at dawn."

Shadow Weaver says: "You have to be lying."
Shadow Weaver says: "What happened to Adora?"
Shadow Weaver says: "What did you do?"
Catra says: "What did I do?"

She-Ra says: "I told Queen Angella I would."
She-Ra says: "Besides, people like me better as She-Ra."
Glimmer says: "Hmm."
Glimmer says: "Yep."
Glimmer says: "Very useful to our mission."
Bow says: "Hey, guys."
Bow says: "What is that?"
She-Ra says: "Must be coming from the Horde camp."
Perfuma says: "You're here!"
Glimmer says: "Princess Perfuma."

She-Ra says: "We heard about the blockade and we've come to help."
She-Ra says: "We brought food and supplies for you."
Perfuma says: "Welcome to Plumeria, She-Ra."

Perfuma says: "Come with me, I'll show you around."
Perfuma says: "You're gonna love it."
Baby cooing.
New Scene.
Perfuma says: "Our people have lived here in tranquility for thousands of years."
Perfuma says: "We're known for our beautiful flowers, our majestic trees."
Perfuma says: "And this is the Heart-Blossom, the center of our kingdom, and the source of all my magical powers."
Bow says: "At least this tree is fine."
Bow says: "What happened to everything else?"
Perfuma says: "We're going through a little rough patch, but I'm sure the universe will right itself soon."
Glimmer says: "Everything is dead or dying."
Perfuma says: "Look, the blight hit right after the Horde arrived."
Perfuma says: "We don't know why, and nothing I do stops it."
Perfuma says: "But we don't dwell on the negative."
Perfuma says: "Look at the positive."
Perfuma says: "The Heart-Blossom is still healthy, and the She-Ra is here, and the celebration's about to begin."
She-Ra says: "Celebration?"

Shadow Weaver says: "I've done no such thing, Lord Hordak."
Shadow Weaver says: "My will is your will."
Hordak says: "Then explain to me why you've requisitioned more troops to look for one missing soldier."
Hordak says: "A soldier I ordered you to give up on."
Shadow Weaver says: "Finding Adora is crucial to the Horde's mission—"
Hordak says: "Understand?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Of course, Lord Hordak."
Shadow Weaver yells.
New scene.

Plumerian elder says: "It is our honor to serve the She-Ra."
Food crunches.
Perfuma says: "We are so honored to have you."
Plumerian Citizen 1 says: "Whoa."
Plumerian Citizen 1 says: "That's She-Ra."
Perfuma says: "Yes, I know."
Perfuma says: "The She-Ra, right?"
Perfuma says: "I'm so happy that after all these centuries of being gone, you've finally returned."
Perfuma says: "I said, break out party kale."
Perfuma says: "And at our hour of greatest need, just like in the stories."
She-Ra says: "What stories?"
Perfuma says: "The stories we've been telling for thousands of years."
Perfuma says: "She-Ra, the warrior who tamed the beasts of Beast Island with a single word."
Bow says: "That's nothing."
Bow says: "What about the time She-Ra defeated a squad of Horde soldiers on a flying horse?"
Bow says: "Or the time she saved Thaymor from a legion of Horde soldiers?"
Bow says: "Or the time she borrowed my toothbrush and used it to defeat an army of Horde soldiers."
She-Ra says: "Uh, Bow, that's not true."
Bow says: "You're right."
Bow says: "It was two armies!"
She-Ra says: "Uh..."
Baby coos.
Glimmer says: "Hey, calm down!"
Glimmer says: "Give her some space."
Glimmer says: "One at a time."

Perfuma says: "Will you be doing it before the drum circle or after?"
She-Ra says: "You want me to--You want me to heal your land?"
Perfuma says: "Yes!"
Perfuma says: "Like in the ancient story, "She-Ra Heals the Forest And Brings The Trees Back To Life."
Glimmer says: "I've seen her do way weirder stuff."
Glimmer says: "This'll be a snap."
She-Ra says: "Wait, it's not that simple."
She-Ra says: "Plus, I don't like the look of that smoke."
She-Ra says: "The Horde's up to something big."
She-Ra says: "Maybe we should investigate."
Perfuma says: "We?"
Perfuma says: "This is my power."
Perfuma says: "I grow plants."
Perfuma says: "We're not strong enough to go up against the Horde."
Perfuma says: "All we want is to live peacefully in our ancestral home."
Bow says: "And then She-Ra saved the day once again!"
Child laughs.
Perfuma says: "We need you, She-Ra."
All chanting She-Ra! She-Ra! She-Ra!
She-Ra says: "Yes, healing."
She-Ra says: "That is a thing I know how to do."
She-Ra says: "I just need to take Bow and Glimmer over to those trees for a moment."
She-Ra says: "I know what I'm doing!"
New scene.
She-Ra says: "I don't know what I'm doing!"
She-Ra says: "I can't heal anything!"
Bow says: "But, the stories say you have healing powers."
She-Ra says: "They also say I fought the Mantisaur."
She-Ra says: "I don't even know what that is!"
Glimmer says: "Why don't you just concentrate really hard?"
Glimmer says: "That seems to work whenever you need to transform."
She-Ra says: "Okay."
She-Ra grunting.
She-Ra says: "Did I do it?"
Bow says: "No, you punched a tree."
Bow says: "That's kinda the opposite of healing."
She-Ra says: "Let me try again."
She-Ra grunts.
Glimmer shrieks.
Glimmer says: "Magic blast."
Glimmer says: "Also not healing."
She-Ra says: "I'll get it this time."
She-Ra grunts.
Animal screeches.
Glimmer says: "Magical transformation?"
Bow says: "Wait, is that what happened to our horse?"
She-Ra grunts.
Thudding.
Bow says: "It's okay."
Bow says: "You'll get it soon."
She-Ra says: "Soon isn't good enough!"
She-Ra says: "These people expect me to save their land."
She-Ra says: "I thought I was better as She-Ra, but I'm useless no matter what form I take."
Explosion nearby.
Bow says: "My hat!"
Perfuma says: "She-Ra!"
Perfuma says: "Come quickly!"

All gasping.
Adora says: "Sorry."
Adora says: "I don't know how to heal."
Plumerian Citizen 2 says: "Who are you?"
Plumerian Citizen 2 says: "And where's She-Ra?"
Adora says: "My name is Adora."
Adora says: "I was chosen to carry the sword of She-Ra, but..."
Adora says: "I haven't been doing this for very long, and I don't know exactly how it works yet."
Plumerian elder says: "She's just a girl!"
Adora says: "I never meant to deceive you."
Adora says: "I am She-Ra, I'm just not the same She-Ra."
Perfuma says: "Then you can't save us?"
Adora says: "Wait!"
Adora says: "There might be another way."
Adora says: "I know the Horde."
Adora says: "I think they're using one of their machines to poison your land."
Adora says: "If we wanna save your home, we have to stop them!"
Plumerian Citizen 2 says: "You're not She-Ra from the stories."
Plumerian Citizen 2 says: "You were supposed to save us."
Perfuma says: "It will be all right, I promise."
Perfuma says: "We will rebuild."
Perfuma says: "We have to believe that the universe will repay the Horde for their evil deeds eventually."
Glimmer says: "The universe won't protect you!"
Glimmer says: "You want She-Ra to fix everything, but won't even try to save yourselves?"
Glimmer says: "At least Adora's trying."
Perfuma says: "If She-Ra can't save us, no one can."
Perfuma says: "Right now, we just need to make sure our people are safe."
Perfuma says: "We leave today."
Glimmer says: "Are you okay?"
Adora says: "I just wanted to help."
Adora says: "But all I've done is disappoint an entire kingdom."
Adora says: "I'm sorry I let you guys down after you talked me up."
Bow says: "We just wanted everyone to see what an awesome person you are."
Bow says: "I thought I was being supportive, but I was actually being terrible!"
Glimmer says: "Adora, She-Ra's not the reason we like you."
Glimmer says: "We like you because you're our friend."
Explosion nearby.
Glimmer says: "You have a plan, don't you?"
Adora says: "Yeah."
Adora says: "I think I do."
New scene.
Adora says: "All clear."
Adora says: "Okay, we need to find the machine."
Adora says: "Every Horde camp is laid out the same."
Adora says: "Guard duty's in half-hour shifts, so we walk in when the shift changes in three, two, one."
Horde soldier 1 says: "Shift change!"
Horde soldier 2 says: "Finally!"
Horde soldier 2 says: "I swear, boring shifts go by slower."
Adora gasps.
Glimmer says: "You were right."
Glimmer says: "The Horde is poisoning the land."
Horde soldier says: "Hey!"
Horde soldier says: "What are you doing here?"
Adora says: "What are you doing here?"
Adora says: "We have security clearance, password 5-echo-niner."
Adora says: "Now be on your way."
Horde solider says: "We haven't used that password in months."
Horde solider says: "Hands up!"
Bow says: "Adora?"

Adora says: "Run!"
New scene.

Perfuma says: "If we don't make it, I wanted to say I'm sorry."
Perfuma says: "I couldn't be the hero you wanted."
Perfuma says: "-Adora."
Perfuma says: "She's still trying, even though we were so negative."
Perfuma says: "Glimmer was right."
Perfuma says: "This is our home, we can't let her do this alone!"
Perfuma says: "Everyone, She-Ra and our friends from Bright Moon are risking their lives to protect us from the Horde."
Perfuma says: "We need to help them!"
Perfuma says: "Get the warchimes, we march!"
New scene.
Adora says: "How many soldiers can you take?"
Bow says: "Between one and..."
Bow says: "zero."
Bow says: "Whoo."
Glimmer says: "I'll take them all, if you give me a minute."
Perfuma says: "I've always said the universe will repay the Horde one day."
Perfuma says: "Well, I guess that day is today!"
Plumerian Child says: "For the She-Ra!"
Glimmer says: "Hey."
Glimmer says: "Ooh."
Perfuma says: "I've never been so alive!"
Adora says: "For the honor of Grayskull!"

Horde Soldier says: "Ew!"
Horde Soldier says: "Yuck!"
Horde Soldier says: "Retreat!"
Horde Soldier says: "Retreat!"
Perfuma says: "Thank you so much!"
Perfuma says: "You inspired us to save ourselves."
Perfuma says: "How can we ever repay you?"
Glimmer says: "Join the Rebellion, and help me reform the Princess Alliance."
Perfuma says: "Um, are you sure?"
Perfuma says: "Didn't that go horribly the first time?"
Glimmer says: "It went horribly for our parents."
Glimmer says: "But we have a chance to do it right."
Glimmer says: "We're clearly stronger together."
Glimmer says: "Think what all the Princesses united could do."
Perfuma says: "Would I get to hit more people with flowers?"
Glimmer says: "Absolutely."
Perfuma says: "You have a deal."
Perfuma says: "Hey, everyone!"
Perfuma says: "Look at us."
Perfuma says: "We're mighty rebels now."
All cheering.
New scene.
Door closes.
Shadow Weaver says: "This was brought to me by retreating soldiers, retreating because their camp was attacked by Adora and She-Ra."
Shadow Weaver says: "Pathetic, you're still trying to protect her."
Shadow Weaver says: "Did you think you could keep the truth from me?"
Catra says: "It's just a phase, she's confused."
Catra says: "I'll bring her back in, I swear."
Shadow Weaver says: "Oh, yes, you will."
Shadow Weaver says: "Because until I tell you otherwise, that is your mission."
Shadow Weaver says: "And to ensure success, no matter where Adora goes, no matter how long it takes, my shadow spies will find her."
Catra gasps.
Shadow Weaver says: "Find her and bring her home."
New scene.
Door opens.
Adora says: "What is this?"
Glimmer says: "Since you've never slept in a room by yourself before, Bow and I thought we'd throw you a sleepover, then you won't feel so alone."
Bow says: "We even got you a new bed."
Adora says: "It's wonderful."
Bow says: "We can do this tomorrow too, since Glimmer's grounded for ignoring orders."
Glimmer says: "For one week."
Glimmer says: "That's three weeks less than normal."
Glimmer says: "And Mom said she'd consider my plan to recruit new Princesses into the rebellion!"
Adora says: "Thanks, guys."
Adora says: "I might not ever be the perfect hero everybody wants me to be, but that's okay."
Adora grunts.
Glimmer says: "Of course it's okay."
Glimmer says: "Do you have any idea how annoying you'd be if you were perfect?"
Glimmer and Adora laughing.
Bow says: "Aw!"
Bow says: "Best Friend Squad is having a pillow fight!"
