Perfuma says: "Hey, robot face, watch where you step."
Bow says: "Incoming."
Mermista says: "Got it."
Perfuma says: "Sorry, Frosta."
Mermista says: "Wow, flower princesses can't aim."
Perfuma says: "I'm working on it."
Frosta says: "Look out!"
Glimmer says: "Got it."
Glimmer says: "Thanks for dropping in."
Frosta says: "Dropping in, because you dropped him from the sky."
Frosta says: "Good one."
She-Ra grunting and shouting while destroying bots.
She-Ra says: "Woo-hoo!"
Catra says: "Oh, cute."
Catra says: "You can turn your sword into stuff."
Catra says: "Hey, Adora."
Catra says: "Did you mean to do that?"
Catra says: "If you did, it's a terrible weapon."
She-Ra says: "Is not."
Frosta says: "How'd you do that?"
Frosta says: "Can you teleport anything you want?"
Frosta says: "Like a cannon?"
Frosta says: "I can make ice cannonballs."
Glimmer says: "What?"
Glimmer says: "No."
Glimmer says: "Just the staff."
Glimmer says: "It was my dad's-- Ugh."
Glimmer says: "Actually, I was sort of in the middle of something here."
Glimmer says: "Do you mind?"
Frosta says: "It's more effective if you hit their core processing unit."
Glimmer says: "Ugh."
Glimmer says: "I know."
Frosta says: "Hey."
Frosta says: "There's another one."
Frosta says: "Let's get it."
Catra says: "What are you waiting for?"
Catra says: "You gonna play me a song on that thing?"
Catra says: "I knew you couldn't do it."
Adora says: "Did you have to make her so mean?"
Light Hope says: "The simulation is designed for total accuracy."
Light Hope says: "Is the one you call Catra not mean?"
Adora says: "No."
Adora says: "She is."
Light Hope says: "There."
Light Hope says: "There."
Perfuma says: "The poor woods."
Perfuma says: "They'll never be able to regrow if the bots keep attacking."
Bow says: "Hey!"
Bow says: "I was looking at that."
Frosta says: "You're welcome."
Adora says: "I've been training for a month and I haven't gotten any better."
Light Hope says: "This performance was, in fact, worse."
Light Hope says: "Please disregard."
Light Hope says: "My human inspiration protocol is still in the beta stage."
Light Hope says: "Should I smile more?"
Adora says: "No, no."
Adora says: "It's not you."
Adora says: "I wanna be the best She-Ra, I wanna protect the planet."
Adora says: "But Catra, she's just in my head."
Light Hope says: "She has access to your mainframe?"
Adora says: "She isn't actually in my head."
Adora says: "When you grow up with someone, they know how to push your buttons."
Light Hope says: "I can relate."
Light Hope says: "I also have buttons."
Light Hope says: "You have come a long way, but there is still much to do."
Light Hope says: "You must learn to master your emotions, or you are destined to repeat the mistakes of the last She-Ra."
Adora says: "No pressure, huh?"
Light Hope says: "There is quite a bit of pressure."
Light Hope says: "Was that not clear?"
Adora says: "Yeah, no, I got it."
Adora says: "So much pressure."
Light Hope says: "Very well."
Light Hope says: "You must learn by doing."
Kyle says: "No."
Kyle says: "Oh, no."
Catra says: "Who can tell me what Kyle did wrong?"
Lonnie says: "Where do you start?"
Catra says: "She-Ra is too strong to defeat with force alone."
Catra says: "But she's slow and easily manipulated."
Kyle says: "Not again."
Catra says: "Fix this."
Catra says: "Then go again."
Catra says: "Huh?"
Catra says: "What is all this junk?"
Entrapta says: "Isn't it wonderful?"
Entrapta says: "The stuff from my castle arrived."
Catra says: "Yeah."
Catra says: "Wonderful."
Catra says: "What's the report from the woods?"
Entrapta says: "Oh!"
Entrapta says: "I just received a transmission from one of my bots."
Scorpia says: "Oh, boy."
Scorpia says: "Ouch."
Entrapta says: "Oh, wow, it just fell apart with one hit there, didn’t it."
Entrapta says: "I could definitely make some improvements."
Scorpia says: "Oh-ho, yeah!"
Scorpia says: "Game over."
Catra says: "It doesn't matter."
Catra says: "We'll just send more bots, and more after that."
Catra says: "They'll be so busy defending their precious trees, we'll conquer the planet before they know what's happened."
Entrapta says: "I have an even better idea."
Glimmer says: "You should've seen it."
Glimmer says: "With the Moonstone super-charged, I've been so much more powerful."
Glimmer says: "I took out, like, at least five bots."
Bow says: "Just like the day before, and the day before that."
Glimmer says: "So?"
Glimmer says: "What are we supposed to do?"
Glimmer says: "Not fight?"
Glimmer says: "We have to protect the woods."
Glimmer says: "The Horde is going to keep taking ground until it regrows."
Bow says: "I know, but how long can we keep this up?"
Bow says: "Did you learn anything from Light Hope?"
Adora says: "Uh..."
Adora says: "Getting way better at transforming my sword."
Adora says: "Look."
Bow says: "A pitcher."
Bow says: "That's so useful."
Glimmer says: "We can picnic once the woods regrow."
Frosta says: "We should turn it into a dagger."
Frosta says: "See me take out that bot with daggers?"
Glimmer says: "Where did you come from?"
Frosta says: "I've been here the whole time."
Glimmer says: "Well, we have to go."
Glimmer says: "We have an important meeting."
Frosta says: "The war council?"
Frosta says: "I'm heading there, too."
Frosta says: "Better hurry, you're gonna be late."
Bow says: "Do we have a new addition to the Best Friends Squad?"
Glimmer says: "Shut up."
Glimmer says: "Ugh."
- They arrive in the Council Chamber says: "Mermista, Perfuma, Netossa, and Spinerella."
where they meet with Queen Angella says: "Mermista, Perfuma, Netossa, and Spinerella."
her General Juliet says: "Mermista, Perfuma, Netossa, and Spinerella."
Castaspella says: "Mermista, Perfuma, Netossa, and Spinerella."
Swift Wind says: "Mermista, Perfuma, Netossa, and Spinerella."
the other Princesses says: "Mermista, Perfuma, Netossa, and Spinerella."
Perfuma says: "Sorry, heh, I think that's my chair."
Mermista says: "Yeah, don't you find it helpful to shift perspectives sometimes?"
Glimmer says: "Aunt Casta!"
Glimmer says: "You made it."
Castaspella says: "I wouldn't miss it, dearest."
Castaspella says: "The first war room of the new alliance."
Castaspella says: "How exciting."
Angella says: "Yes."
Angella says: "It’s a shame you couldn't be at the battle where the alliance was formed."
Castaspella says: "I knew you'd bring that up again."
Angella says: "We have a great deal to discuss."
Angella says: "Everyone."
Angella says: "Please take your seats."
Angella says: "Swift Wind, what news do you bring from your scouting in the west?"
Swift Wind says: "The Horde has gained more territory in the west."
Swift Wind says: "But with the help of Netossa and Spinnerella, our forces have managed to re-capture Thaymor."
Swift Wind says: "Again."
Swift Wind says: "Also, why don't I get a chair?"
Swift Wind says: "If everyone else has a chair, I want a chair."
Angella says: "A chair."
Angella says: "Of course."
Angella says: "I will see to it."
Angella says: "Commander Glimmer, how goes the situation in the Whispering Woods?"
Glimmer says: "I'm happy to report that we are handling bots, and protecting the woods while it regrows."
Glimmer says: "Which it is doing."
Glimmer says: "Very."
Glimmer says: "Slowly."
Perfuma says: "Maybe it's time we stop fighting and start healing."
Perfuma says: "My powers aren't strong enough to regrow the entire woods on my own, but when we princesses worked together in harmony during the battle of Bright Moon, our powers grew."
Perfuma says: "We should try to recapture that energy."
Perfuma says: "Maybe we should hold hands and think healing thoughts."
Bow says: "If I may, Your Majesty."
Bow says: "We can't go on like this."
Bow says: "We're defeating the bots, but more keep coming."
Bow says: "While we're using our resources to hold our borders, the Horde hasn't had to deploy a single soldier."
Adora says: "Typical Catra!"
Bow says: "I've only been able to recover pieces,  seeing as we have never not completely demolished one of these things."
Bow says: "But if we could capture a whole bot, I might be able to program a kill switch."
Bow says: "We could wipe them all out without draining our forces."
Angella says: "An excellent idea, Bow."
Angella says: "This could turn the tide for us."
Angella says: "Glimmer, you will take your patrol out, and capture a bot for Bow to study and carry out his plan."
Frosta says: "Commander, I have some ideas to improve our efficiency."
Frosta says: "First, we should all have code names."
Frosta says: "I'd like to be Frostbite."
Frosta says: "And you could be Sparklebomb."
Glimmer says: "Oh, uh, Frosta."
Glimmer says: "I need you toooo."
Glimmer says: "."
Glimmer says: "."
Glimmer says: "stay back and help Spinnerella and Netossa guard the castle!"
Glimmer says: "Great."
Glimmer says: "Thanks!"
Catra says: "With the woods frozen and the princesses distracted by the bots, we've been able to gain significant new ground."
Hordak says: "You have not disappointed me, Force Captain."
Hordak says: "Clearly, I was wise to promote you."
Entrapta says: "I'm just gonna borrow this."
Entrapta says: "Oh, what is that?"
Catra says: "Uh, yes."
Catra says: "We've kept the princesses distracted, but we could be doing more."
Catra says: "We should be working to take them out, once and for all."
Catra says: "Isn't that right, Entrapta?"
Catra says: "Entrapta!"
Entrapta says: "Oh, right."
Entrapta says: "May I introduce Emily's Kid Sister."
Entrapta says: "EKS for short."
Entrapta says: "With First Ones tech at its core, this little beauty has enough power to rival a princess."
Hordak says: "Impressive indeed."
Hordak says: "And you can make more of these?"
Entrapta says: "Yes!"
Entrapta says: "I mean, no."
Entrapta says: "I mean, I could."
Entrapta says: "But I only had enough First Ones tech to make four."
Catra says: "But I know where we can get more."
Glimmer says: "Okay."
Glimmer says: "We'll split up to cover the most ground."
Glimmer says: "Adora, Bow and I will go east."
Glimmer says: "Mermista and Perfuma, you go west."
Glimmer says: "Swift Wind, cover the sky and tell us when there's a bot nearby."
Bow says: "And, remember, we want an intact bot."
Mermista says: "What if it's just, like, a little waterlogged?"
Perfuma says: "And also covered in ferns that secrete corrosive poison?"
Frosta says: "Or what if it's totally smashed by my ice hammer?"
Glimmer says: "Frosta!"
Glimmer says: "You're supposed to be defending the castle with Netossa and Spinnerella."
Frosta says: "I know I ignored orders, but, no offense, those orders were wrong."
Frosta says: "You need me here."
Glimmer says: "You can't just run off whenever you want."
Frosta says: "But I did."
Frosta says: "And I'm here now."
Frosta says: "And I'm not going back."
Glimmer says: "Fine."
Glimmer says: "You can be in Mermista and Perfuma's patrol."
Frosta says: "I'm going with you."
Glimmer says: "Don't push your luck."
Bow says: "Uh, guys?"
Bow says: "That thing is way more advanced than usual."
Glimmer says: "Where is it going?"
Glimmer says: "Why isn't it attacking the woods?"
Adora says: "It's still just a Horde bot."
Adora says: "Okay."
Adora says: "That's new."
Glimmer says: "Ha!"
Bow says: "It's learning!"
Adora says: "Yeah, well, I'm about to teach it something."
Adora says: "For the honor of Grayskull!"
She-Ra says: "What?"
She-Ra says: "We'll capture another bot."
She-Ra says: "That one had it coming."
She-Ra says: "Yeesh."
She-Ra says: "I'm sorry I destroyed it."
Swift Wind says: "Ooh, that's unnatural."
Swift Wind says: "Even for a robot."
Glimmer says: "Frosta!"
Glimmer says: "Do you even listen when people tell you things?"
Frosta says: "What?"
Glimmer says: "Get away from that bot!"
Frosta says: "It’s the bot you should be worried about!"
Glimmer says: "Frosta!"
Perfuma says: "There you are."
Perfuma says: "We've been looking everywhere for you."
Mermista says: "Yeah."
Mermista says: "Everywhere."
Glimmer says: "That was incredibly stupid!"
Glimmer says: "You could've gotten hurt, or gotten one of us hurt!"
Frosta says: "I was just trying to help."
Glimmer says: "This is serious, not a game."
Glimmer says: "You need to stop getting in our way!"
Glimmer says: "Frosta, wait."
Mermista says: "Ouch."
Bow, She-Ra, and Swift Wind emerge from the edge of the clearing.
Bow says: "The Horde's new bots are too fast and too smart."
Bow says: "We'll never be able to catch one."
Bow says: "I thought I could help, and be the Rebellion's tech master."
Bow says: "But that was obviously a dumb idea."
She-Ra says: "It wasn't."
She-Ra says: "You're the only one who came up with a real plan."
She-Ra says: "Without it, we'd still just be reacting to the bots."
She-Ra says: "We need to stop letting the Horde manipulate us."
She-Ra says: "So let's put our heads together and think."
Bow says: "Those bots weren't interested in the woods."
Bow says: "And, they only defended themselves long enough to get away."
Mermista says: "Well, that means attacking us wasn't their mission."
Swift Wind says: "And they all ran off in the same direction."
Perfuma says: "So whatever they're after is that way."
She-Ra says: "The only thing that's in that direction is -- the Beacon."
She-Ra says: "I know where the bots are going."
She-Ra says: "And I’ve got an idea for how to stop them."
She-Ra says: "Frosta, do you think you can--?"
She-Ra says: "Where's Frosta?"
Glimmer says: "I’ll go find her."
Frosta says: "Come to yell at me more?"
Frosta says: "I just wanted to be your friend."
Glimmer says: "By ignoring us and throwing yourself into danger?"
Frosta says: "Sorry I don't know how to act."
Frosta says: "I've never had any friends before!"
Frosta says: "I was eight when I took over the throne."
Frosta says: "It’s kind of hard to make friends when everyone is your sworn subject."
Glimmer says: "I know how you feel."
Glimmer says: "I didn't have any friends before Bow and Adora."
Frosta says: "You?"
Frosta says: "Figured everyone would wanna be your friend."
Glimmer says: "Yeah, definitely not everyone."
Glimmer says: "And I'm still learning how to be a good friend, too."
Glimmer says: "I’m sorry I yelled."
Glimmer says: "It's just -- I guess you remind me of..."
Glimmer says: "me."
Glimmer says: "And I can do some really dangerous stuff sometimes."
Frosta says: "I remind you of you?"
Glimmer says: "Ugh."
Glimmer says: "And I even sounded like my mom when I yelled at you."
Glimmer says: "Please don't make me do that again."
Frosta says: "Deal."
Frosta says: "Does that mean we're friends?"
Glimmer says: "Yes."
Glimmer says: "And we -- I could really use your help."
Frosta says: "You want me to come back?!"
Frosta says: "!"
Frosta says: "I knew we'd make a great team!"
Frosta says: "So, should I do ice hammers or daggers?"
Frosta says: "You're right, one of each!!"
Catra says: "That place has enough First Ones tech inside to power a whole armada of robots forever."
Entrapta says: "Ahhh, I want that!"
Frosta says: "Ice of you to drop in!"
She-Ra says: "Switch things up."
She-Ra says: "Keep them guessing."
Bow says: "We just need to capture one."
Bow says: "Take the others out."
Scorpia says: "One bot down, but three to go!"
Entrapta says: "Fight, EKS’s, fight!"
Frosta says: "Showed you, bot-face!"
Scorpia says: "Ooh, he is not recovering from that."
Entrapta says: "Ahhhh, I can't look."
Entrapta says: "Tell me what's happening."
Entrapta says: "No, don't."
She-Ra says: "Why can't you be what I want you to be?!!!"
She-Ra says: "!!!"
She-Ra says: "Hmm."
She-Ra says: "Hey, Catra."
Scorpia says: "It’s okay."
Scorpia says: "We have two left."
Entrapta says: "Do you have tooooo?"
Catra; Whatever. We'll find more tech.
She-Ra says: "Bow, look!"
She-Ra says: "I got one."
Bow says: "Adora!"
Bow says: "Get away from it!"
She-Ra says: "What just happened."
She-Ra says: "."
She-Ra says: "."
She-Ra says: "?"
Bow says: "It looks like the bots can self-destruct."
She-Ra says: "Catra."
Bow says: "We can't let that one self-destruct!"
She-Ra says: "Everyone together!"
She-Ra says: "Whoopsies."
Now, it’s Mermista’s and Frosta’s turn.
Mermista says: "You ready, Ice Princess?"
Frosta says: "Yeah!!"
Bow says: "Ha, ha!"
Perfuma says: "Look!"
Frosta says: "Whoaaaa!"
Frosta says: "Did we do that?"
Perfuma says: "We did, all of us working together!!!"
Mermista says: "Personal space."
Catra says: "You look terrible."
Shadow Weaver says: "Catra."
Shadow Weaver says: "It's been so long."
Shadow Weaver says: "I assumed Hordak finally realized what a lazy, worthless creature you are and banished you."
Catra says: "Just the opposite."
Catra says: "Hordak values me."
Catra says: "I've been busy helping the Horde get closer than ever to defeating the Rebellion."
Catra says: "His words."
Shadow Weaver says: "If you're doing so well, why are you here?"
Shadow Weaver says: "It's Adora, isn't it?"
Catra says: "So?!"
Catra says: "!"
Catra says: "I let her win one."
Catra says: "We're gaining ground, and our armies are growing!"
Catra says: "When they're ready to roll out, I will be at the head!!"
Catra says: "And you'll be here rotting."
Catra says: "Thanks."
Catra says: "I needed this."
Frosta says: "So, we're okay now that the woods are growing back."
Frosta says: "Right?"
Adora says: "Light Hope says there's still a lot to fix with the planet, but at least it won't be as easy for the Horde to attack us."
Frosta says: "Thanks again for saving me, you know, after that bot threw me off the cliff."
- Glimmer says: "Friends stick together."
- Glimmer says: "No princess left behind."
Bow says: "Uh, okay."
Bow says: "I'm talking into this recorder because that's what the best scientist I ever knew did."
Bow says: "I'm not really sure who I'm talking to."
Bow says: "Me, I guess."
Bow says: "So, hi, Future Bow."
Bow says: "We're about to open this thing."
Bow says: "First Ones tech?"
Bow says: "Hold onto your hat, Future Bow."
Bow says: "Entrapta's alive."
Bow says: "."
Bow says: "."
Bow says: "And we left her behind."
