Adora says: "Huh?"
Both Grunting.
Glimmer says: "Stay where you are!"
Adora says: "What did you do to me?"
Glimmer says: "What do you mean what did 'I' do to you?"
Adora says: "I didn't know being a princess was contagious!"
Bow says: "Okay, okay, everyone, calm down!"
Bow says: "Wanna tell us how you did that?"
Adora says: "I didn't do anything."
Adora says: "All I did was pick up the sword, and then, whoosh, I'm in a tiara!"
Glimmer says: "I don't care how she did it."
Glimmer says: "We just have to make sure she never does it again!"
Roaring.
All Shouting.
Roars.
Bow says: "Do it again!"

All Grunting and Shouting.
All Groaning.
Adora says: "What is this place?"
Bow says: "No idea, but in there's gotta be better than out here."
Glimmer says: "Everyone, grab on, I can get us in there!"
Bow says: "Glimmer, no!"
Bow says: "You've never teleported three people before."
Glimmer says: "Do you have a better idea?"
Both Gasp.
Adora says: "What's written on this door?"
Adora says: "It looks like some kind of password."
Bow says: "You can read that?"
Adora says: "You can't?"
Bow says: "What's it say?"
Adora says: "Uh, "Eternia."
Glimmer says: "Oh, come on!"
Scene change.
Bow says: "So, Horde soldier, have you always been able to read First Ones' writing?"
Glimmer says: "Wanna tell us what exactly is going on here?"
Adora says: "I told you I don't know I just read the word on the door."
Glimmer says: "Right..."
Glimmer says: "You read a word in a language that no one's spoken for a thousand years, and the door just opened into a mysterious ancient ruin."
Glimmer says: "Sure."
Adora says: "You think I did this on purpose?"
Adora says: "You think I wanted to be a princess?"
Adora says: "Princesses are monsters."
Glimmer says: "Monsters?"
Glimmer says: "You're the monster!"
Bow says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Bow says: "Glimmer, she did save us."
Glimmer says: "I don't care!"
Glimmer says: "We can't just trust her, Bow."
Glimmer says: "Or have you forgotten everything the Horde's done to us?"
Glimmer says: "The people we've lost."
Glimmer says: "We need to find another way out of here and get her back to Bright Moon as soon as possible."
Glimmer says: "My mother will know what to do with her."
Bow says: "Hey, so, thanks for saving us from that bug thing back there when you could've escaped instead."
Adora says: "Okay, well I didn't save you."
Adora says: "I just wanted to get the sword, okay?"
Bow says: "Are you sure it's not because you secretly like us?"
Adora says: "Wh--?"
Adora says: "I don't like you."
Adora says: "You're my captors."
Bow says: "Sure."
Scene change.
Bow says: "Thanks for saving us anyway."
Bow says: "I'm Bow, by the way."
Adora says: "Adora."
Bow says: ""Adora."
Bow says: "" Ah."
Bow says: "Weird name for a Horde soldier."
Adora says: "Is it?"
Glimmer says: "For the honor of Grayskull."
Bow says: "What are we doing?"
Glimmer says: "Nothing!"
Glimmer says: "I mean, uhh.."
Glimmer says: "Look at these carvings."
Glimmer says: "I think this might be a First Ones' ruin."
Adora says: "What's a First One?"
Glimmer says: "You've never heard of the First Ones?"
Bow says: "The First Ones are the original settlers of Etheria."
Bow says: "They disappeared a thousand year ago, but they left behind a lot of old ruins and technology."
Bow says: "Like this place."
Adora says: "So, what happened to them?"
Bow says: "No one knows."
Bow says: "They just disappeared."
Bow says: "The Horde didn't tell you about them?"
Adora says: "Seems like there's a lot the Horde didn't tell me."
Glimmer says: "Ugh."
Glimmer says: "How do we get out of here?"
Bow says: "Hey!"
Bow says: "Wanna turn on some lights, Adora?"
Adora says: "I don't know how to do that."
Bow says: "Maybe there's a magic word."
Bow says: "Ooh, what's the First Ones' word for "lights"?"
Adora says: "I don't know."
Adora says: "I'm not magic."
Glimmer says: "Obviously."
Glimmer says: "Everyone, stand back."
Bow says: "Uh, Glimmer?"
Bow says: "Maybe you should take it easy."
Bow says: "We're a long way from Bright Moon."
Bow says: "It'll be awhile until you can recharge."
Glimmer says: "Bow!"
Adora says: "You have to recharge your powers?"
Glimmer says: "Can we not talk about this in front of the Horde soldier?"
Glimmer says: "Now, stand back."
Adora says: "Whoa."
Bow says: "Wow."
Bow says: "Are you okay?"
Glimmer says: "I'm fine, Bow."
Bow says: "Oh hey!"
Bow says: "That's you!"
Adora says: "What?"
Adora says: "That doesn't look anything like me."
Bow says: "No, I mean, the other you."
Bow says: "The scary one in the cape."
Adora says: "That was me?"
Bow says: "You can read that inscription, right?"
Bow says: "What's it say?"
Adora says: "It says..."
Adora says: ""She-Ra."
All Shouting.
Light Hope says: "Greetings, administrator."
Adora says: "What is this thing?"
Light Hope says: "What is your query?"
Bow says: "I think it's some kind of ancient hologram."
Light Hope says: "What is your query?"
Bow says: "Uh..."
Bow says: "Hi."
Bow says: "What is this place?"
Bow says: "How do we get out of here?"
Light Hope says: "What is your query?"
Bow says: "Welp."
Bow says: "She's broken."
Glimmer says: "She's old."
Glimmer says: "I'm surprised any of this stuff still works at all."
Light Hope says: "Administrator not detected."
Light Hope says: "Lockdown initiated."
Glimmer says: "I didn't do it!"
Bow says: "No."
Bow says: "No."
Bow says: "No lockdown!"
Bow says: "No lockdown!"
Bow says: "Adora, you gotta get it to stop!"
Adora says: "What makes you think I can?"
Light Hope says: "Query not recognized."
Bow says: "There's gotta be a password or something!"
Adora says: "Uh, stop it!"
Adora says: "Uh, Eternia!"
Adora says: "Eternia!"
Adora says: "Give me the sword!"
Glimmer says: "What?"
Glimmer says: "No!"
Adora says: "We need the scary lady in the cape."
Adora says: "I don't know how, but she's the key to this place, so maybe she can get us out."
Glimmer says: "You're a Horde soldier."
Glimmer says: "I'm not giving you the sword."
Shouting.
Adora says: "Eternia!"
Adora says: "Uh, cape!"
Adora says: "Uh..."
Adora says: "She-Ra!"
Glimmer says: "Hold on!"
Bow says: "Glimmer, no!"
Scene change.
Screaming.
Bow says: "Glimmer!"
Grunting.
Bow says: "Glimmer?"
Bow says: "Glimmer!"
Glimmer says: "Did it work?"
Bow says: "Yeah, it worked."
Bow says: "Barely."
Bow says: "Are you alright?"
Glimmer says: "I'm fine."
Glimmer says: "I think I used too much power getting us out of there."
Bow says: "I don't know who could've predicted that..."
Bow says: "Oh, right."
Bow says: "Me."
Glimmer says: "Bow..."
Bow says: "Like an hour ago."
Glimmer says: "Bow!"
Bow says: "Sorry."
Bow says: "I'm just glad you're okay."
Bow says: "No more teleporting for awhile, okay."
Bow says: "You could really hurt yourself."
Glimmer says: "I'm fine, okay?"
Glimmer says: "Let's just get back to Bright Moon so I can recharge already."
Glimmer says: "Why are you still here?"
Adora says: "What?"
Glimmer says: "Bow and I are hardly a crack security team."
Glimmer says: "You could've escaped at any time."
Glimmer says: "Why didn't you?"
Adora says: "I just-- I wanna figure out what's happening to me, and if I go back to the Fright Zone, then I'll never know."
Adora says: "I never knew where I came from or who my family was."
Adora says: "Shadow Weaver said it didn't matter who I was before, that-- that I was nothing before Hordak took me in."
Adora says: "There's always been a part of me that I don't know anything about an-- and all of this, it feels familiar somehow."
Adora says: "I don't know how else to explain it."
Bow says: "Glimmer's mom knows more about First Ones' tech than anyone."
Bow says: "She'll know what's going on with you and the sword for sure."
Bow says: "So, if you want your questions answered, stick with us?"
Glimmer says: "Let's go."
Glimmer says: "There should be a village a few miles from here."
Glimmer says: "They'll be able to give us a ride back to Bight Moon."
Glimmer says: "We've wasted too much time already."
Scene change.
Shadow Weaver says: "For the last time, where is Adora?"
Catra says: "For the last time, I don't know."
Catra says: "You think I keep her on a leash?"
Shadow Weaver says: "I know you're lying."
Shadow Weaver says: "You two are close."
Shadow Weaver says: "She would never depart without telling you."
Catra says: "Then I guess she let us both down, huh?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Have it your way."
Shadow Weaver says: "I already know where she is."
Shadow Weaver says: "We've been tracking her."
Catra says: "Uh, then why did you ask me?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Because you are going to bring her back."
Catra says: "I don't think so."
Shadow Weaver says: "Your insolence will not protect her."
Shadow Weaver says: "You will do as I ask."
Catra says: "Oh, yeah?"
Catra says: "Or what?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Or you will suffer the consequences in her place."
Scene change.
Glimmer says: "Okay, the jacket comes off."
Adora says: "What?"
Adora says: "Why?"
Glimmer says: "If the villagers see a Horde soldier, they'll freak out."
Glimmer says: "We gotta fix all this."
Adora says: "I feel ridiculous."
Bow says: "That’s ‘cause you need something to tie it all together."
Adora says: "I don't like it."
Glimmer says: "Point is, you don't look like a Horde soldier."
Glimmer says: "Just keep a low profile."
Glimmer says: "We'll be in and out."
Scene change.
Adora says: "What is this?"
Bow says: "It's a festival."
Bow says: "Like a big party."
Bow says: "You don't have parties in the Fright Zone?"
Adora says: "Oh, right, parties."
Adora says: "I mean, yeah, pfft, of course."
Adora says: "I, uh-- I don't know what that is."
Bow says: "Ah!"
Glimmer says: "Did you even hear me?"
Glimmer says: "I said, in and out!"
Bow says: "She has never been to a party before, Glimmer!"
Bow says: "This is serious."
Bow says: "So, seriously?"
Bow says: "No parties ever?"
Bow says: "What do you guys do on your birthday?"
Adora says: "Huh?"
Bow says: "No birthdays?!"
Bow says: "!"
Bow says: "How is your life this sad?"
Adora says: "What is that?"
Bow says: "That would be a horse."
Adora says: "It's majestic."
Bow says: "You wanna go meet it?"
Adora says: "What?"
Adora says: "No!"
Bow says: "Come on, it's okay."
Bow says: "See, he likes you."
Adora says: "This is the best day of my life."
Glimmer says: "Bow."
Bow says: "Come on, I know you like her, too."
Adora says: "What's going on?"
Glimmer says: "It's the Horde!"
Bow says: "Why are they here?"
Bow says: "The people of Thaymor aren't a threat."
Adora says: "Wait."
Adora says: "Did you say Thaymor?"
Adora says: "This can't be Thaymor."
Glimmer says: "Did you know something about this?"
Adora says: "No."
Adora says: "I mean, yes."
Adora says: "But there's a mistake."
Adora says: "Thaymor's supposed to be a heavily fortified rebel fortress, not a civilian town!"
Glimmer says: "Do you really think that matters to them?"
Adora says: "I can get them to stop."
Adora says: "This is all a big mistake."
Adora says: "I just need to talk to them."
Adora says: "Get as many people out as you can and don't let them see you."
Adora says: "I'm sorry."
Glimmer says: "Adora!"
Scene change.
Adora says: "Stop!"
Catra says: "Adora!"
Adora says: "Catra?"
Catra says: "They let me drive a tank."
Catra says: "Believe it?"
Adora says: "Catra, I don't understand."
Adora says: "What are you doing here?"
Catra says: "Uh, duh, we came to find you."
Catra says: ""Cover for me, Catra."
Catra says: "No one will even  know I'm gone."
Catra says: "" Seriously, did you just get immediately captured right after you snuck out--?"
Catra says: "What are you wearing?"
Adora says: "Uh..."
Scene change.
Glimmer says: "Bow!"
Bow says: "Hey!"
Scene change.
Adora says: "There's no time."
Adora says: "We have to put a stop this."
Catra says: "What?"
Catra says: "Why?"
Adora says: "Because this is a civilian town."
Adora says: "Look around!"
Adora says: "These aren't insurgents."
Adora says: "They're innocent people."
Catra says: "Yeah, sure."
Catra says: "Innocent people who kidnapped a Horde officer."
Catra says: "Now come on, let's get you back to the Fright Zone."
Catra says: "Shadow Weaver is freaking out."
Catra says: "It'd be funny if she weren't such a terrible person."
Adora says: "Catra, no."
Adora says: "I can't go back."
Adora says: "Not until the Horde leaves this town alone."
Adora says: "You have to help me."
Catra says: "What are you saying?"
Adora says: "I’m saying, this is wrong."
Adora says: "They've been lying to us, manipulating us."
Adora says: "Hordak, Shadow Weaver, all of them."
Catra says: "Duh!"
Catra says: "Did ya just figure that out?"
Catra says: "Manipulation is Shadow Weaver's whole thing."
Catra says: "She's been messing with our heads since we were kids."
Adora says: "How could you possibly be okay with that?"
Catra says: "Because, it doesn't matter what they do."
Catra says: "The two of us look out for each other."
Catra says: "And soon we'll be calling the shots."
Catra says: "Now, can we go home already?"
Adora says: "I'm not going home, Catra."
Adora says: "I can't."
Adora says: "Not after everything I've seen."
Adora says: "Come with me."
Adora says: "You don't have to go back there."
Adora says: "We can fix this."
Catra says: "Are you kidding?"
Catra says: "You've known these people for, what, a couple of hours?"
Catra says: "And now you're just gonna throw everything away for them?"
Catra says: "Ugh."
Catra says: "What happened to you?"
Catra says: "Adora: I don't know."
Catra says: "But I have to do something."
Catra says: "I'm sorry, Catra."
Scene change.
Bow says: "Ah!"
Bow says: "I think that's all of them."
Bow says: "Glimmer, let's go!"
Bow says: "What are we gonna do?"
Glimmer says: "There's nothing we can do, Bow."
Glimmer says: "You're almost out of arrows and I'm almost out of magic."
Bow says: "You can't say that."
Bow says: "You're Glimmer."
Bow says: "You throw yourself into every fight, no matter how hopeless."
Glimmer says: "Ugh."
Glimmer says: "Every decision I've made in the last day has almost gotten us killed."
Glimmer says: "My mom's right, I'm not ready for this yet."
Bow says: "No."
Bow says: "You are not giving up right now."
Bow says: "I’m sorry your mom doesn't see how strong you are, but that's her loss."
Bow says: "You can do this, Glimmer, and you don't have to do it alone."
Glimmer says: "You're right."
Glimmer says: "We need Adora."
Bow says: "We do?"
Bow says: "Didn't she just sell us out to the Horde?"
Glimmer says: "I don't think she did."
Glimmer says: "We need to find her."
Glimmer says: "I think she can help us."
Glimmer says: "Just trust me."
Glimmer says: "Okay?"
Scene change.
Catra says: "Oh, man."
Catra says: "That was a lot stronger than I thought."
Catra says: "Are you okay?"
Adora says: "Catra!"
Catra says: "I'm sorry!"
Catra says: "It was a reflex."
Adora says: "Why are you doing this?"
Catra says: "Because you left me."
Catra says: "And if I don't bring you back, Shadow Weaver’s gonna have my head."
Catra says: "So, enough with your weird little identity crisis and let's go home already."
Catra says: "Or do I need to zap you again?"
Adora says: "Glimmer?"
Glimmer says: "Watch out!"
Catra says: "Adora!"
Scene change.
Adora says: "Glimmer?"
Adora says: "What are you doing?"
Adora says: "Why did you save me?"
Glimmer says: "We need you."
Glimmer says: "We need She-Ra."
Glimmer says: "I should've given this back to you in the ruin."
Glimmer says: "You could've saved us in there and I knew that."
Glimmer says: "But I was stupid."
Glimmer says: "And a jerk."
Glimmer says: "And I almost got us killed and I'm sorry!"
Adora says: "You're not any of those things."
Adora says: "I'm the Horde soldier."
Adora says: "How do you know you can trust me now?"
Glimmer says: "I don't."
Glimmer says: "But I hope I can."
Glimmer says: "I feel like maybe you're here to help us."
Adora says: "For the honor of Grayskull!"
Scene change.
Bow says: "It's been an honor serving beside you, Horsey."
Glimmer says: "Bow!"
Glimmer says: "Are you okay?"
Bow says: "Is that Adora?"
Glimmer says: "It's She-Ra."
Horde soldier says: "Retreat!"
Adora says: "Catra..."
Bow says: "You did it!"
Adora says: "I did?"
Glimmer says: "You saved us."
Glimmer says: "You saved everyone!"
Adora says: "I did it."
Adora says: "I turned against the Horde."
Adora says: "I turned against the Horde!"
Adora says: "Why did I do that?"
Adora says: "I can't go back now."
Adora says: "Where am I supposed to go?"
Glimmer says: "Hey, hey."
Glimmer says: "It's okay."
Glimmer says: "You're with us now."
Glimmer says: "C’mon, let's go home."
Bow says: "Best-friends squad!"
Bow says: "Wait, whose horse was this?"
