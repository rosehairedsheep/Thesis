Catra says: "The cities forces have all fled."
Catra says: "Dryl is ours."
Scorpia says: "All right."
Scorpia says: "I mean I guess it, kind of, was already ours since they're Princess is on our side and all, but the banners, they really make it feel official."
Catra says: "Where are you?"
Scorpia says: "That is a great question and the answer is "I do not know"."
Scorpia says: "Yea, this place is some kind of maze."
Catra says: "There."
Catra says: "That's me."
Catra says: "Follow it out when you're done."
Catra says: "And hurry up we have work to do."
She-Ra grunting as she battles EKS in a simulation.
Adora says: "Whewh, getting pretty good huh?"
Light Hope says: "You have shown improvement."
Light Hope says: "But your attack would have been 57% more effective if you had support from your steed."
Light Hope says: "It is time to bring Swift Wind into your training."
Adora says: "Um, shouldn't I work on mastering my own abilities first?"
Light Hope says: "As She-Ra, your sacred connection with your steed is as important as any of your physical abilities."
Light Hope says: "He is a part of you, your destinies are intertwined."
Swift Wind says: "They sure are!"
Swift Wind says: "Hi, Adora!"
Swift Wind says: "I've been here a while but there wasn't a good time for me to make my grand entrance, until now."
Light Hope says: "I requested his presence."
Glimmer says: "What do you mean?"
Glimmer says: ""Entrapta's alive"?"
Bow says: "I couldn't figure out how the Horde was making such big technological advances."
Bow says: "But it all makes sense now."
Bow says: "They must be holding Entrapta prisoner."
Bow says: "I found First Ones tech in this bot."
Bow says: "This is what Entrapta was experimenting on before she..."
Glimmer says: "Before we left her behind in the Fright Zone."
Bow says: "We didn't know."
Glimmer says: "It doesn't matter."
Glimmer says: "We should have gone back for her."
Glimmer says: "We should've tried."
Glimmer says: "She got captured trying to save us."
Glimmer says: "Well, we're not just leaving her there now."
Glimmer says: "We've got to rescue her."
Bow says: "How?"
Bow says: "We can't just walk into the Fright Zone."
Bow says: "That's how we got in this mess in the first place."
Glimmer says: "Maybe we don't have to."
Glimmer says: "Look."
Bow says: "No, the Horde took Dryl."
Glimmer says: "We just got word."
Glimmer says: "The Horde has Entrapta, now they have Dryl."
Glimmer says: "The timing can't be a coincidence."
Bow says: "Of course."
Bow says: "They're making her use her own lab."
Glimmer says: "We're going to Crypto Castle, we'll find Entrapta and bring her back."
Glimmer says: "No Princess left behind."
Bow says: "Yes!"
Bow says: "Totally on board."
Bow says: "Let's get Adora."
Glimmer says: "Adora is out training with Light Hope."
Bow says: "What about the other Princesses?"
Glimmer says: "Entrapta got taken trying to save us, Bow."
Glimmer says: "I'm not going to be responsible for losing anyone else."
Adora says: "Uhhh, Light Hope?"
Swift Wind says: "Did I break her?"
Swift Wind says: "Was it when I went through her head?"
Light Hope says: "The time has come for the two of you to forge your sacred bond."
Light Hope says: "--I -- Is there something wrong?"
Swift Wind says: "Well, I, yea."
Swift Wind says: "You kind of froze there for a second."
Adora says: "Are you okay?"
Light Hope says: "Forgive me, my system is overloading."
Light Hope says: "I may have to delay today's training so that I can rest."
Adora says: "Is there anything that I can do to help?"
Light Hope says: "Perhaps."
Light Hope says: "This is the Watchtower."
Light Hope says: "Once it allowed me to access my planetary mainframe."
Light Hope says: "But it was destroyed by Mara when she lost control and attacked the planet."
Light Hope says: "I have been functioning at only a fraction of my power ever since."
Light Hope says: "If you can repair the Watchtower, my capabilities will improve, and training can commence."
Adora says: "Fix the Watchtower, got it."
Adora says: "Okay, so we're just gonna..."
Adora says: "We're just gonna go."
Bow says: "Any sign of Entrapta in the castle?"
Glimmer says: "Nothing."
Glimmer says: "And as usual that place is impossible to navigate."
Kyle says: "Hello?"
Kyle says: "Please say you're on your way back."
Kyle says: "I need backup!"
Kyle says: "Entrapta's new invention has lost it!"
Entrapta says: "Bot #437 seems to be having some sort of existential crisis."
Entrapta says: "Down, boy, down!"
Catra says: "Pull it together Kyle, you're fine."
Entrapta says: "Stop it!"
Entrapta says: "Please, why are you doing this to me?"
Bow says: "Entrapta, she's really alive."
Glimmer says: "And they're hurting her."
Bow says: "Wait!"
Glimmer says: "Where is she?"
Catra grunting and shouting.
Scorpia and Glimmer grunting and shouting.
Bow and Catra grunting and shouting.
Bow says: "Glimmer we've got to get out of her now!"
Catra says: "Get them!"
Glimmer exclaiming.
Bow says: "Wait."
Bow says: "Isn't this where we started?"
Glimmer says: "I hate this place!"
Catra says: "I see the rebels have sent their finest."
Glimmer and Catra grunting and shouting.
Glimmer says: "Bow!"
Bow says: "Glimmer, wake up!"
Catra says: "What did you just do to me?"
Bow says: "Get back."
Swift Wind says: "Adora and Swift Wind, on an adventure."
Swift Wind says: "Fix'n a thing that Mara broke."
Swift Wind says: "When she went nuts."
Adora says: "Swift Wind, could you not do that?"
Swift Wind says: "Just trying to keep us entertained while we look for this Watchtower."
Swift Wind says: "Any sign of it?"
Adora says: "There's nothing here but grass."
Adora says: "Maybe Light Hope got the location wrong."
Swift Wind says: "No, I don't think she did."
Swift Wind says: "I definitely sense something here, something ancient and magical."
Adora says: "Where?"
Swift Wind says: "I'm not sure."
Swift Wind says: "Perhaps if we were to combine our efforts, my intuitive powers might increase."
Adora says: "No that's ok."
Adora says: "I just, just have to keep looking."
Adora says: "It has to be here somewhere."
Swift Wind says: "I could be wrong, but I'm sensing something's bothering you."
Adora says: "I'm just really focused on fixing Light Hope."
Adora says: "Like you should be."
Swift Wind says: "No, you're troubled about something else."
Swift Wind says: "As your magnificent steed I am attuned to your emotions."
Adora says: "Okay, can you stay out of my head, please?"
Swift Wind says: "I'm not in your head."
Swift Wind says: "You're just very bad at hiding your feelings."
Swift Wind says: "Is it about me?"
Adora says: "I'm fine and no, it's not about you."
Swift Wind says: "Is it Bow?"
Swift Wind says: "Glimmer?"
Swift Wind says: "Catra?"
Swift Wind says: "The Horde?"
Swift Wind says: "The crushing weight of your new responsibilities as the savior of Etheria?"
Adora says: "Stop."
Adora says: "I'm fine, I promise."
Adora says: "Just..."
Adora says: "let me think."
Swift Wind says: "Okay."
Swift Wind says: "I'm gonna do a few loop-de-loops."
Adora says: "Hey!"
Adora says: "Swift Wind."
Swift Wind says: "What's up?"
Adora says: "I think I found the Watchtower."
Bow says: "We took a hostage!"
Bow says: "We're supposed to be the good guys."
Bow says: "Maybe we should just let her go..."
Glimmer says: "Let her go?"
Glimmer says: "Did she let us go?"
Glimmer says: "No!"
Glimmer says: "She let the Horde torture us."
Bow says: "Uh, yeah, because she's a bad guy."
Glimmer says: "Listen."
Glimmer says: "We didn't mean for this to happen."
Glimmer says: "But it did, and now we should use it to our advantage."
Glimmer says: "We're taking you to Bright Moon."
Glimmer says: "If your people want you back they'll have to give us Entrapta."
Catra says: "Entrapta?"
Catra says: "Who's that?"
Glimmer says: "We know you have her!"
Glimmer says: "Where is she?"
Glimmer says: "What are you doing to her?"
Bow says: "Glimmer."
Catra says: "Ohhh, Entrapta."
Catra says: "You mean the Princess you left behind to die?"
Catra says: "Ha."
Catra says: "Don't worry."
Catra says: "We're taking good care of her."
Glimmer says: "On your feet Horde scum."
Catra says: "Whoops."
Catra says: "I can't walk."
Catra says: "Unless you want to untie me."
Glimmer says: "Nice try."
Glimmer says: "I'll just teleport us there."
Bow says: "Uh, Glimmer, can I talk to you real quick?"
Bow says: "Bright Moon is pretty far away."
Bow says: "Shouldn't you wait until we get closer to teleport us there?"
Bow says: "You don't want to run out of power and get us stuck out here."
Bow says: "Especially with her."
Glimmer says: "Fine."
Swift Wind and Adora gasp.
Swift Wind says: "Wow."
Swift Wind says: "Mara really did a number on this place."
Adora says: "So, let's put it back together."
Adora says: "For the Honor of Grayskull!"
Adora sighs.
Swift Wind says: "She-Ra and Swift Wind."
Swift Wind says: "Forging a sacred bond."
Swift Wind says: "Fixing a magic tower."
Swift Wind says: "With a magical sword."
Catra grunts.
Bow says: "Hey, are you okay?"
Catra says: "Like you care."
Bow says: "We do, actually."
Bow says: "The Rebellion treats it's prisoners with compassion."
Catra says: "You princess-types have to be about the bleeding hearts."
Catra says: "Everything with you is about the power of friendship."
Catra says: "How's that working out for you?"
Bow says: "Come on."
Bow says: "I bet even the Horde has friends."
Bow says: "What about Adora?"
Catra scoffs.
Bow says: "You two grew up together, right?"
Bow says: "What was she like as a kid?"
Catra snarls.
Bow says: "Glimmer and I have known each other forever too."
Bow says: "She'd teleport to the roof to get my lost arrows when I was learning to shoot."
Catra says: "Wow, you two must be really close?"
Catra says: "Sounds like Glimmer would do anything for you, huh?"
Bow says: "Absolutely."
Bow says: "She's my best friend."
Catra says: "Good to know."
Glimmer says: "Bow!"
Catra says: "Oh, hey princess."
Glimmer says: "How are you such a nightmare?!"
Glimmer says: "!"
Catra says: "Ah, years of practice."
Bow says: "Can we please discuss this when we're not hurtling to our deaths?"
Glimmer says: "You know what?"
Glimmer says: "I'm ready to see if cats really do land on their feet?"
Bow says: "Please don't do that, she is attached to me!"
Bow says: "Glimmer!"
Glimmer says: "Okay."
Catra coughing.
Glimmer says: "Not a fan of water huh?"
Glimmer says: "Get off of me!"
Bow says: "Glimmer!"
Bow says: "Help!"
Glimmer groans.
Bow says: "Okay, ready to be rescued from this whenever you are."
Glimmer says: "Just need a minute to rest."
Bow says: "Um, what could you do with ten seconds?"
Catra says: "Seriously?"
Catra says: "You guys are terrible at this."
Glimmer groans.
Catra says: "At least we're all in one piece."
Catra says: "Can't say the same for Entrapta."
Glimmer shouts.
Bow says: "Glimmer, are you ok?"
Catra says: "Aww."
Catra says: "What's wrong?"
Catra says: "Sleepy after all that magic?"
Glimmer says: "I'm fine."
Glimmer says: "You're not worth my time."
Glimmer says: "C'mon, it's a long walk to Bright Moon."
Glimmer says: "Put more ropes on her."
Catra's com-badge beeps.
Scorpia says: "What do you mean there's no sign of her?"
Scorpia says: "Where could they have gone?"
Scorpia says: "Think, think Scorpia."
Scorpia says: "Do we tell Hordak?"
Scorpia says: "Send out a search-party?"
Scorpia says: "Put up posters?"
Scorpia says: "How are we gonna find Catra?"
Scorpia says: "I mean if somebody has touched a hair on her head, I don't know..."
Scorpia says: "huh?"
Scorpia says: "Oh, she's signaling us."
Scorpia says: "We can follow this right to her."
Scorpia says: "Catra, you beautiful genius, I'm coming!"
Swift Wind says: "Try concentrating."
Swift Wind says: "Focus the She-Ra."
Swift Wind says: "She-Ra..."
Adora says: "I can't concentrate when you're distracting me!"
Adora says: "This worked in Salineas."
Swift Wind says: "Hey, you know what might help?"
Swift Wind says: "Loop-de-loops, with me."
Swift Wind says: "Get on my back."
Adora says: "Swift Wind, you're not taking this seriously."
Swift Wind says: "I'm just saying everything's better with loop-de-loops."
Adora says: "It's fine, I got this."
Swift Wind whinnies.
Adora says: "Still got this."
Catra says: "I don't know about you guys, but I'm beat."
Catra says: "Getting held hostage is so much work."
Catra says: "Almost as exhausting as torturing Entrapta every day."
Glimmer says: "Uhg."
Glimmer says: "Just ignore her."
Catra says: "You're looking pretty tired too princess."
Catra says: "Running out of glitter?"
Glimmer says: "Bow, can't you keep her mouth shut?"
Bow says: "I tried, but she bites."
Glimmer says: "How did Adora take years of this?"
Glimmer says: "She didn't run away from the Horde, she ran away from you."
Catra says: "And where is she now?"
Catra says: "Off being She-Ra?"
Catra says: "Get used to it."
Catra says: "You think she's not going to leave you behind, too, Sparkles?"
Scorpia says: "Don't move!"
She-Ra says: "How's that look?"
Swift Wind says: "You know what?"
Swift Wind says: "I don't think that one goes there after all."
Swift Wind says: "In fact, it might be upside down."
Swift Wind says: "Maybe you should take it all apart and start again?"
Swift Wind says: "You seem stressed."
Swift Wind says: "Why don't we list all our favorite things until we feel better?"
Swift Wind says: "I'll go first."
Swift Wind says: "Apples, hay, toppling unjust hierarchies, apples..."
Swift Wind says: "Wait, I said that already."
She-Ra says: "What are you doing?"
Swift Wind says: "I'm helping!"
Swift Wind says: "I'm She-Ra's steed and that's what I do."
She-Ra says: "This isn't helping!"
She-Ra says: "Can you just..."
Swift Wind says: "Adora!"
Scorpia says: "Catra, are you okay?"
Scorpia says: "Did they hurt you?"
Scorpia says: "I will crush them."
Glimmer says: "She's fine."
Glimmer says: "We want to make a trade."
Glimmer says: "We'll release Catra if you release Entrapta."
Catra says: "I have a better trade."
Catra says: "You release me right now or we'll finish Entrapta off once and for all."
Bow says: "What?"
Glimmer says: "She's bluffing."
Catra says: "Scorpia, get Kyle on the comm."
Entrapta says: "No, no, no!"
Entrapta says: "Wait!"
Entrapta says: "Oh no."
Kyle says: "Force Captain, I knew you'd call me back."
Kyle says: "What do I do?"
Catra says: "If you don't hear back from me in thirty seconds, take Entrapta out."
Kyle says: "What?"
Entrapta says: "Just relax."
Entrapta says: "We'll figure this out."
Entrapta says: "Everything's okay."
Glimmer says: "Two can play at that game."
Scorpia says: "Catra!"
Scorpia says: "If you touch her again..."
Catra says: "Easy there Big Gal, she's not going to try anything."
Catra says: "They're noble rebels after all."
Catra says: "They play by the rules."
Glimmer shouting.
Bow says: "Glimmer, stop!"
Glimmer says: "This isn't fair."
Glimmer says: "After everything she's done?"
Glimmer says: "After what she did to us?"
Glimmer says: "We're just supposed to let her go?"
Glimmer says: "How do we know they'd really get rid of Entrapta, Bow?"
Glimmer says: "They need her."
Bow says: "We can't take that chance."
Bow says: "We're not them."
Scorpia says: "Oh."
Scorpia says: "Oh!"
Scorpia says: "Come here!"
Scorpia says: "Come on."
Scorpia says: "I'm just so glad this nightmare is over."
Catra says: "Wow."
Catra says: "I didn't think you'd actually buy that."
Glimmer says: "We held up our end of the bargain."
Glimmer says: "Now, show us that Entrapta's alive."
Catra says: "You and Adora are perfect for each other, I'll give you that."
Catra says: "Earnest, naive, ridiculously easy to manipulate."
Catra says: "It's adorable."
Catra says: "And it's why you're never going to win."
Catra says: "Kyle, if you actually took me seriously just then, call it off."
Entrapta says: "Kyle isn't available at the moment."
Kyle shouting.
Entrapta says: "But I've got it under control."
Entrapta says: "Don't worry, this was just the prototype."
Entrapta says: "The next model will be much, much bigger."
Bow says: "Entrapta?"
Bow says: "What's going on?"
Catra says: "Oh hey."
Catra says: "You wanna talk to her?"
Entrapta says: "Oh, hi Bow."
Entrapta says: "What are you doing there?"
Glimmer says: "Just hang on Entrapta, we're going to rescue you."
Entrapta says: "Oh good!"
Entrapta says: "Rescue me from what?"
Glimmer says: "From the Horde!"
Entrapta says: "Oh, well, that's nice of you."
Entrapta says: "But all of my stuff is here now, so probably I'll just stay."
Entrapta says: "Thanks anyway though."
Bow says: "Entrapta, are you on the Horde's side now?"
Entrapta says: "I'm on the side of science."
Entrapta says: "But I am living at the Fright Zone now, and the Horde is supplying me with tools and materials for my work."
Entrapta says: "So, yes?"
Entrapta says: "I guess?"
Catra says: "Did I forget to mention that?"
Catra says: "Ha."
Catra says: "Oops."
Entrapta says: "But don't worry about me."
Entrapta says: "I love it here."
Entrapta says: "I've made unbelievable progress in my research."
Entrapta says: "And the Horde has been so supportive."
Entrapta says: "I'm getting closer every day to unraveling the mysteries of Etheria."
Entrapta says: "Hacking the Black Garnet was just the first step."
Bow says: "That was you?"
Catra says: "So much for the power of friendship."
Bow says: "Come on Glimmer, lets go."
Bow says: "Glimmer?"
Glimmer grunts.
Swift Wind says: "Adora!"
Swift Wind says: "Adora!"
Swift Wind says: "Are you okay?"
Adora says: "I don't know what I'm doing."
Adora says: "I don't even know what this Watchtower is supposed to do or how it's supposed to help."
Swift Wind says: "If that's the case then why are you doing all of this anyway?"
Adora says: "I need to be a better She-Ra than Mara."
Adora says: "I need to know how to control my powers so I don't hurt people like she did."
Adora says: "Light Hope is the only one that can teach me, and she's broken."
Swift Wind says: "You're really freaking out about this Mara thing aren't you?"
Adora says: "How could I not?"
Adora says: "She ruined everything."
Adora says: "And I don't know how to fix it."
Swift Wind says: "I'm sorry I didn't take this mission more seriously."
Swift Wind says: "The truth is, I'm just so excited to be your steed."
Swift Wind says: "I guess I just got carried away."
Adora says: "I'm sorry I dragged you into this with me."
Adora says: "You were just a horse before I accidentally zapped you with my sword."
Adora says: "If it we'rent for me, you would've been able to live out the rest of your days carefree in a nice pasture in Thaymore."
Swift Wind says: "Adora, I wouldn't trade my voice and my wings for anything."
Swift Wind says: "I've got the chance to change the world now."
Swift Wind says: "To make it better than when I found it."
Swift Wind says: "I can't imagine ever going back."
Swift Wind says: "Can you?"
Adora says: "No."
Adora says: "I don't think I can."
Glimmer grunting and shouting.
Catra laughing.
Glimmer shouting.
Bow says: "Glimmer!"
Catra says: "Forget the princess, she's got no power!"
Catra says: "Get him!"
Glimmer says: "I'm not as naive as you think."
Glimmer says: "Turns out I saved a little magic, just for you!"
Scorpia shouting.
Catra screams.
Scorpia says: "No!"
Glimmer sighs.
Swift Wind gasps.
Adora says: "Is this..."
Adora says: "?"
Swift Wind says: "Our sacred bond?"
Watchtower thrums.
Swift Wind says: "This is it."
Swift Wind says: "This is what I've been sensing."
Swift Wind says: "This is the epicenter."
Adora says: "She-Ra destroyed this place, now it's up to She-Ra to fix it."
Adora says: "For the honor of Grayskull!"
Watchtower thruming.
She-Ra gasps.
Swift Wind says: "Don't worry, I got this."
Swift Wind says: "Loop-de-loops!"
She-Ra says: "Woo-hoo!"
She-Ra says: "Wow!"
Swift Wind says: "Not a bad team."
Swift Wind says: "Looks like we're getting the hang of this."
Light Hope says: "Then I will be back to operation..."
Light Hope says: "My sensors indicate they fixed it."
Light Hope says: "Good."
Bow says: "At least we know for sure that Entrapta's alive, and working for the Horde, making weapons to wipe us out."
Adora says: "Hey guys."
Adora says: "You'll never guess what Swift Wind and I did today."
Adora says: "We restored a First Ones' Watchtower so Light Hope can balance the planet, and we brought a whole field back to life and..."
Adora says: "What happened to you?"
Glimmer says: "Oh Adora, we've got a lot to catch you up on."
Credits Roll.
